Impossible Impossible

23
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:48,440
Yes, for those who have heard about my live 3D jazz show the
first time, the first show sold out.

24
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,440
So we added a second show, a second late night show even.

25
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,500
So I'm going to be so jet lagged and silly.

26
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm like, oh gosh, will I even be able to sing?

27
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,840
Oh no.

28
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,660
So a second show has been announced.

29
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,980
Tickets will be announced via Oshi Spark.

30
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,120
So, yes.

31
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,420
And then, of course, it will also be streamed.

32
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,360
So there will be streaming tickets as well.

33
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,560
But yeah.

34
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,500
Yeah.

35
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,080

second show, I want to.

36
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,900

Yeah.

41
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,020
Any idea of streaming tickets will be just the first show.

42
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,060
Actually, let me see if I can ask.

43
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,300

Very excited that we were able to announce that.

86
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:33,670
But today, right now, playing Japan Stigmatized property
which is spooky have you guys heard of these before i've

87
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:42,350
probably because there have been other games based off of
stigmatized properties like the chela's art game right but

88
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:50,890
for those who don't know basically a stigmatized property is
like a place where somebody has passed um or like a violent

89
00:10:50,890 --> 00:11:01,110
crime has occurred and so um oh i don't mean like the game i
mean like the act like the actual stigmatized properties in

90
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:09,950
japan no i'm not talking about the game i'm talking about
what stigmatized properties are you guys not like the game

91
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:19,830
not the get like if you've heard of if you've heard of the
actual term before yeah it's based on irl stuff it's the bad

92
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:30,330
juju exactly exactly it's places that got that funky energy
maybe are you scouting for new mid cafe I don't want to be

93
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,890
in a place that's haunted by somebody else.

94
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,510
That's too crowded.

95
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,630
No roommates.

96
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,210
Ghost hunting.

97
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,110
Found one.

98
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,410
There's a house near me that's a stigmatized property.

99
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:47,890
Freaky.

100
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,190
Nah.

101
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,930
Actually, in my last maid's cafe, there was a place by me
that was a stigmatized property.

102
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:13,550
I remember I remember I was coming back from haunting and
and uh there were a bunch of police and everything and I was

103
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:23,610
like whoa what's going on and I I did a little snooping and
it turns out that like the sun had gone crazy and like

104
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:30,850
killed this whole family But, yeah, freaky.

105
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,790
Mint wants a place to herself.

106
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,670
That's why she's clearing out one of these from the spooks.

107
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,990
The ghosts here.

108
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,510
I don't know.

109
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,350
I don't think we're...

110
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,130
I don't know if we're getting rid of them or not.

111
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,970
They might be here to stay.

112
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,730
We might just be identifying them.

113
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,030
Is your cafe a stigmatized property?

114
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:54,770
I don't know.

115
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,570
Mysterious.

116
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:08,150
If someone died here Who would die in a maid cafe?

117
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,790
That's like ridiculousness Do ghosts cost extra?

118
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:20,550
No, actually these properties End up being cheaper It's kind
of awesome Get the proton packs No!

119
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,410
Me No!

120
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:41,880
I activity spikes when monitoring snake i keep thinking that
sound effect is my doorbell that sound it's kind of creepy

121
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:55,950
that's a doorbell bell sound the ghost should have to pay
rent though i disagree you can't force me to pay rent but

122
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:03,610
yeah so the guy who lived in my place before me died in
there there's still damage on the door from where they had

123
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:17,810
to break it down thankfully i'm only haunted by minto they
had to break it down that's scary wow that's creepy dexy oh

124
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:29,470
my gosh there was one time i was at like an idol show and my
oshi she was just so casually talking about how like her mom

125
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:38,050
sees a bunch of ghosts and stuff and like just how her place
is haunted and i was like i knew you were my Ži for a reason

126
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:52,550
i knew it i knew you were my Ži for a reason just like just
her cat she was just like yeah and like as a kid i would see

127
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,890
this and that And sometimes I still sometimes see things.

128
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,010
And I'm like, well, you know, she definitely, she definitely
sees things.

129
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,930
Because she sees me.

130
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,170
But I don't think she knows I'm a ghost.

131
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,130
She probably thinks I'm like, I don't know.

132
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,290
I don't know.

133
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,270
Are you haunting her?

134
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,390
Just a little bit.

135
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,830
Stop flirting with your Oshi's mother's bit.

136
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,650
No, it's not me.

137
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,310
I would never, I would never, I would never.

138
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,370
I don't wanna be her, I don't wanna, I don't, I'm like,
okay, usually, this has happened a couple times where I

139
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,690
become friends with my Oshis, but usually I very much like,
don't talk to me.

140
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:45,830
I don't, I'm too, you are, you are, you are, you are heaven,
and I am just a lowly being.

141
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,930
I am just a spirit creature.

142
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,250
Do not, do not perceive me.

143
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:56,190
I just want to, I just want to be like, admiring you from
afar.

144
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,550
To my bushi.

145
00:15:59,090 --> 00:15:59,970
Yes, yes, yes.

146
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:01,010
Hi, Minky.

147
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:01,650
Hello.

148
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,030
What's up, Reese?

149
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,330
Thank you so much.

150
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,430
Thank you for the super chat.

151
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,190
You can't disappoint a picture.

152
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:15,230
Usually though, I know the people say don't meet your
heroes, but like for me, every time I've met my hero, it's

153
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:15,810
been pretty great.

154
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:19,970
So, I don't know.

155
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,770
I have no idea why I'm asking this now.

156
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:29,830
But if the NFL invited Den Setsu EXE to do the halftime show
at the Super Bowl, would you do it?

157
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,410
We're gonna take the Super Bowl!

158
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,310
We're gonna take the Super Bowl!

159
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,530
MVP!

160
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,390
Maybe.

161
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,190
The superb owl.

162
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,810
The superb owl.

164
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,110
Baby.

165
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,670
I don't know anything about football.

166
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,390
I guess you don't have to know anything to...

167
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:00,950
To do the halftime show.

168
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,650
But...

169
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,630
Um...

170
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:07,330
What was it?

171
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,990
I could ask Steiner about, um...

172
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:10,930
Doing an...

173
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:11,110
Uh...

174
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,130
Running an ad.

175
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,570
during the Super Bowl.

176
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,830

Everybody please join the Patreon and then send to EXA
Patreon so that we can have an ad.

178
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,770

179
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,660
Okay, surely.

180
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,760
Surely we can...

181
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,280
Can I get a birthday?

182
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,000
A birthday.

183
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,560
What, what?

184
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,460
From me, doll.

185
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,000
The rather happy birthday.

186
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,820
Happy, happy birthday!

187
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,040
Just a few million for 30 seconds.

188
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,220
What if we had just one second?

189
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,640
What if it was just like, ah!

190
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,280
And that was it.

191
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,860
Just like a ah!

192
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,790
One second, I think is what, a million, no?

193
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,960
Seven to eight million for 30 seconds.

194
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,840
Oh, wait, no, we could totally do that then.

195
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,160
They probably don't have a minimum.

196
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,740

Monthly artwork.

202
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,740
It's 100k for a subliminal ad.

203
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:50,300
Yeah.

204
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:57,600
Everyone will be like, Nobody's going to talk about the ad
that appeared for one second.

205
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,900
We could be like, about to be like, Super Bowl.

206
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,420
And it could just be like, soup.

207
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,860
It go viral for sure.

208
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,740
I think so.

209
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,580
And yet they are talking about it.

210
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:19,900
Soup.

211
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,840
Oh my gosh, wait.

212
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,360
I'm going to tag Steiner right now.

213
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,800
Wait, hold on.

214
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,520
Can you...

215
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,400
Ah, Steiner.

216
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,920
Can you look into how much a...

217
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,880
He said not!

218
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,120
He already messaged me!

219
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,300
I'm at a soup!

220
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,660
Oh my gosh, wait, Steiner!

221
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,580
It's so good!

222
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,220
I didn't even get to finish my message!

223
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,300
Then he just sent a soup emoji.

224
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Okay, I'm done.

225
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,760
I'm done.

226
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:14,620
Make the Super Bowl add one second, but then have a freeze
frame paragraph of everything that Setsui exists about

227
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,560
making people read the whole thing.

228
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,480
He said, we'll think about it.

229
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,040
Yippee!

230
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,040
I wonder if they have a minimum, though.

231
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,900
There's like minimum five second add.

232
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,860
Surely not.

233
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,120
They definitely do.

234
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,260
No, surely not.

235
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,460
Otherwise, can you imagine?

236
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,580
Otherwise, people, like, so many people would be buying
one-second ads.

237
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,780
So many people.

238
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,820
Oh, my God.

239
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,720
He just sent me, please wrap it up.

240
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,180
This is really rude.

241
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:04,590
God, I think that I'm really on to something.

242
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,850
He doesn't like my yapping.

243
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,970
Maybe they never tried because they're too scared.

244
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:14,770
I think if you don't ask, you'll never know.

245
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:16,930
Oh my god.

246
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,390
Get in the hook.

247
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,830
This is so rude.

248
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,770
I'm closing Discord right now.

249
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,070
I'm not listening to you anymore.

250
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:28,230
I'm gonna fire you, Steiner.

251
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,470
I'm making an executive decision.

252
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,250
Okay.

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:53,590

So it's almost even close to Phoebe.

261
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,590
Weewarosaurus.

262
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,210
It's such a cute name.

263
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,510
Is this Mint Talk episode?

264
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,790
The Weewarosaurus pobeni.

265
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,230
Cobeni?

266
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,570

Oh, chainsaw man.

270
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,690
No, I'm thinking of somebody else.

271
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,750
I'm thinking of something from like a slice of life.

272
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,570
Oh, hold on.

273
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,430
Oh, no, no, no.

274
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,010
I'm thinking of somebody from like a slice of life.

275
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,710
Oh, I was thinking of engaged the unidentified.

276
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,950
Her name is Colbeni.

277
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,830
I was listening to that song just the other day, like the
opening.

278
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:57,060
So I was thinking about it yeah yeah yeah cool venue I
really liked that show and the opening is so cute you guys

279
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:10,460
know the game um miracle girl miracle girl stage miracle go
project miracle girl something it was for the PSP reader why

280
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:18,680
can't I remember first of all miracle girls festival it was
a miracle girls festival and And it was a bunch of shows

281
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,960
from...

282
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,920
It was a bunch of shows.

283
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,520
A bunch of anime.

284
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,260
But it was basically...

285
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,720
It was like Project Diva.

286
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,480
But if it was like anime girls instead of like, you know,
just Hatsune Miku.

287
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,960
We wear a Wariosaurus for Nintendo Wii.

288
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,180
Oh no!

289
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,320
Boy, that'd be awesome.

290
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,500
And so it's like Project...

291
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,520
Project Diva, but if it was anime girls.

292
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:55,480
And so you had like wake up girls and you had Ungeashida
unidentified and you had Gochi Usa and you had Nyaruko and

293
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,140
and all these other things.

294
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,060
And it was just a rhythm game but you got to watch them.

295
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,360
They had like they had like dances and everything and it was
really cute.

296
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,680
It was really, really cute.

297
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,460
And you could change their outfits and stuff.

298
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,320
Oh, Miracle Girls Festival.

299
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:27,080
that but Hatsune Miku is anime girl like actually does have
her own anime oh wait no you can't say that like what was

300
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:34,260
that the movie that came out you can't call it Hatsune Miku
anime because all the all the um project Sakai people get

301
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:43,780
angry at you um they they because they'll be like um
actually it's a project Sakai game uh it is not a Miku anime

302
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:48,480
and you need to be correct I'm like, oh no.

303
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,220
Typical Pro-Sekai fans.

304
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,900
But Miku is in it.

305
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,800
Yeah, but you can't call it a Miku movie or else it's like
false advertising.

306
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,480
I guess they like have, they very much care.

307
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,900
They have, they, the other Pro-Sekai like characters in the
Moba Gate are very cherished.

308
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,260
And so they're just like, you are erasing them.

309
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:25,500
telling me about the we war source i didn't know about it of
course i love sometimes i just like sometimes i just look up

310
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:38,640

that are like from places if that makes sense like this

311
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,760
fossil was found only here in this country or something You
know, things like that.

312
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,600
Wow, haven't heard of Miracle Girl in a long time, so you
played Miracle Girls Festival.

313
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,760
Let me bury your child.

314
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,080
Stop me from burying your child, right, Minto?

315
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:08,150
Huh?

316
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,600
Huh?

317
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:23,900
Yes.

318
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,680
What do you think of my country's exclusive dynamic?

319
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,060
to sort of the chile sorus.

320
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,360
Sounds delicious.

321
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,580
I understood that reference.

322
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:34,600
I understand.

323
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,340
What are you, what if I don't understand?

324
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,640
Oh no!

325
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:47,590
Chile sorus.

326
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:48,390
Mmm.

327
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,370
Chili.

328
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,990
My bed shakes randomly for no reason and feels like someone
is crawling in it when I'm trying to sleep.

329
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:54,990
Are you the one?

330
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,590
I'm not hunting you.

331
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,010
I might haunt you.

332
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,390
But I'm not shaking any beds.

333
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:11,490
I think you got someone else Jurassic Park Watch Along when?

334
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,170
Should we?

335
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,930
We could see my favorite Terrasaur, Ketzelco Atlas.

336
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,200
I would be really excited about that.

337
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,940
Only the first four.

338
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,840
But he isn't the most recent one!

339
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,920
Anyway, should we play the game now?

340
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,750
Tofu, NSGT, thank you, welcome back.

341
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,910
Minky the stalker now spooking.

342
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,730
No, this game is an observation type game, you guys.

343
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:12,830
So if you'd like to join along and just scream whenever you
see something, you could just be like, ah, in the chat.

344
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,550
That would be really, really great.

345
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,870
Yeah, we can still yapp while checking out the cameras.

346
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,910
Oh, in this game, the properties that appear are real ones.

347
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:24,670
The spiritual disturbances and incidents that have actually
been reported.

348
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:31,690
Numerous cases of participants disappearing, getting into
traffic accidents, and suffering harm at home have been

349
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:33,270
reported in the original business.

350
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,670
Our company takes no responsibility for any troubles that
may occur during or after gameplay.

351
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,310
Scary.

352
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,930
Oh my gosh, there was one exhibit that I really wanted to go
to in Japan.

353
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,650
but unfortunately I wasn't there before it ended.

354
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:59,330
But it was like an exhibition where on one side you go
through if you can see spirits and then there's another side

355
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,270
that you go through if you can't.

356
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,850
And so it was like a bunch of ghost photography from like
places like this.

357
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:11,290
And if you went through the side where you couldn't see the
ghosts, they would like kind of mark out what you see.

358
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,830
And then if you go through the side where you can see
spirits, you just have like all the pictures hanging up.

359
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,510
It's like, it's like a cool atmosphere.

360
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,550
To all employees.

361
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,090
Conduct business honestly, honestly, and seriously.

362
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,070
Oh, where's me?

363
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,010
This month's blank employees.

364
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:43,530
Oh my god, wait, that's so creepy.

365
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,770
Oh my god, it says like that...

366
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:51,050
Okay, so the people that died, and it says things like
accident, accident, something else, something else.

367
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,590
Please follow the content that follows closely.

368
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,290
Three, two, one.

369
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,610
Lock the doors and windows.

370
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:03,990
Okay.

371
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:05,810
Tell me, Roger.

372
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,610
Welcome to membership.

373
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,830
Cover the mirror with a cloth.

374
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:11,270
Okay.

375
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,170
Hide knives, strings, and drugs out of reach.

376
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,040
Do not close your eyes for more than three seconds.

377
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,280
Oh, okay, okay.

378
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,500
I'm getting on my blinking out of the way.

379
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,460
If you sense something, don't look back.

380
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,880
Not the drugs.

381
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,600
Don't turn around even if you hear voices or hear a noise.

382
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,520
If blank contacts you, recite the following sentence.

383
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:45,840
Oh!

384
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,340
Oh!

385
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:46,840
Oh!

386
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,790
The game has jokes.

387
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,750
Get to work.

388
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,330
I wonder if there's loud noises in this.

389
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:06,170
I don't want to like jump scare you guys more than me.

390
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:07,870
What is special?

391
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,870
Oh, special pay is probably like, uh, I imagine probably,
um,

392
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,310
We're doomed?

393
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:19,510
No, no, no, we're not doomed.

394
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,050
Unreleased property.

395
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:27,150
We could go to Shizuoka, Kurodake, driving.

396
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,830
Tohori!

397
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:31,230
I had a friend that lived in Tohori, K residence.

398
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:32,470
Nagano.

399
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,550
Hotel Selene!

400
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,370
Where do you guys want to go?

401
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,050
Wait, what does it say?

402
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:43,470
Abandoned lodging facility, portraits and writings of a
pregnant woman remain.

403
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,370
That's quite specific.

404
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:52,910
Home where a solitary death occurred, an unidentifiable
altar remains.

405
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:59,210
Former rest stop with a ropeway, unidentified group activity
reported nearby.

406
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,030
What does that mean, a group activity?

407
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,630
Go in order?

408
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,030
Yeah, I guess we'll go in order, right?

409
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,050
Oh, here we go.

410
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,970
Business notification method, all right?

411
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:13,690
Watch the security camera monitor to check for any
abnormalities.

412
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:15,830
If you find any abnormality, press the area of mute.

413
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:16,930
to report it.

414
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:24,730
Example of work failures is overlooking four abnormalities,
incorrectly reporting a non-abnormal area five times in a

415
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,050
row.

416
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,150
Three times for special allowance work.

417
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,010
Please note that these are work failures.

418
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,110
Okay, we're five nights at Freddy's.

419
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:33,950
We're from 12 a.m.

420
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,090
to 5 a.m.

421
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,190
Examples of special anomaly report so far.

422
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:45,190
If an anomaly occurs that covers the entire field of view in
the camera, you can report it by selecting any part of the

423
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,730
field of view.

424
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:51,550
There will be some anomalies that will immediately fail if
left unattended for a long period of time if they occur.

425
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,250
I'm scared.

426
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,470
Don't be scared.

427
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,070
I'm a ghost right here.

428
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:02,190
There are some anomalies that cannot be seen unless you
switch between night vision and normal.

429
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,050
Oh, there's a night vision.

430
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,050
This explanation can also be reconfirmed on the monitor
during work.

431
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:14,650
So we switch and W is for the night vision and press and
hold to report the anomaly.

432
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,030
Is the tech spacing an anomaly?

433
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:20,070
I can't tell if it's on purpose or not.

434
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,040
Are you guys ready to observe?

435
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,200
Spooky happenings?

436
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:29,520
Right.

437
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,560
To all employees.

438
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:37,080
Paranormal activity was previously reported at your assigned
property.

439
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,940
Monitor the camera footage with the utmost caution.

440
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,900
If you notice any changes, report them immediately.

441
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,000
So that's our that's our night vision cam Okay, what is it?

442
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,200
This is a rest stop?

443
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,040
Oh, okay.

444
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,200
All right.

445
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,360
The night vision is so much easier to see, though.

446
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
I hear something in here.

447
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Sounds like a bird.

448
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:15,380
You guys hear it?

449
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:23,880
seeing this thing and i'm like it's a red circle like around
like do you see it you know one of those kinds what the hell

450
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:37,040
are these their chairs what a kind of restop is this what is
this oh my gosh there's so many cameras okay

451
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,480
Did you see it?

452
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,800
Oh, I hear something in here.

453
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,160
Look at the graffiti.

454
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,040
Look at that guy.

455
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,080
Okay.

456
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:54,720
Oh, gosh.

457
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,000
There's so many.

458
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,160
This is going to be tough, I think.

459
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,020
Oh, to all employees.

460
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,060
Yes?

461
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,440
This...

462
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,540
Wait, I just heard a knock.

463
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,020
Wait, there's...

464
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,080
report a phenomena.

465
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,040
If you notice any changes, please let us know.

466
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,000
Wait.

467
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:16,480
Huh?

468
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,340
Wait, this...

469
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,440
Was there blood here before?

470
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,180
Uh-oh.

471
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,060
I already messed up.

472
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,520
What?

473
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,660
What did they spill?

474
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,440
That's no good.

475
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,080
Oh.

476
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,100
There's so much.

477
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,000
Anomaly, bottom right?

478
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,040
I'm trying not to cover up too much.

479
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,160
I don't think I am.

480
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,990
I don't like the hallway.

481
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,270
Typical mail washroom.

482
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:02,950
One time I went, it was during school.

483
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,830
Went on a field trip.

484
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,460
What's that sound?

485
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,520
Went on a field trip.

486
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,060
And I remember this so vivid.

487
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,920
because we're tall employees.

488
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,060
Oh my gosh.

489
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,720
Multinomalies are currently detected.

490
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,660
Oh my gosh, wait.

491
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Identify them without delay and report promptly.

492
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,040
Uh-oh.

493
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Guys, we're gonna lose.

494
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:30,560
We're gonna...

495
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,460
Oh, there's a face!

496
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,080
Um, but I remember on the field trip, there was, um...

497
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:42,380

I'm reporting her?

506
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,240
Great bit, Mint.

507
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:58,700
Thanks.

508
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,600
Oh, it's daytime.

509
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,420
That doesn't seem right.

510
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,320
Meow.

511
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:08,760
Meow.

512
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:10,960
Meow.

513
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Meow.

514
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:12,620
Meow.

515
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:19,600
What kind of ghost do I have to be to be able to control the
sky?

516
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,740
You know what I mean?

517
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,800
In such a way.

518
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,180
But I can control the time of day and everything.

519
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,120
I think I need to get stronger.

520
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,240
What was that?

521
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,960
You guys heard that, right?

522
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:36,960
It was like running or something.

523
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,060
I keep hearing weird noises in the bathroom!

524
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,640
God, I need to be God.

525
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,870
Is that something up there?

526
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,470
I don't know.

527
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:56,730
Pitter powder.

528
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,430
Oh, whoop, whoop.

529
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:03,350
My bad.

530
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,230
That was mean.

531
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,850
I will POV whenever Ben gets close to the screen.

532
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:09,850
Oh, there's a hand!

533
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,350
It's severed even.

534
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,350
Oh, nice.

535
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,230
Oh, report complete.

536
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,050
Okay, good, good, good.

537
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:18,450
That's that.

538
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,610
We were getting yelled at again.

539
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,710
Oh, that's not good.

540
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:25,710
Let's see some nooses.

541
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:26,790
Lots of going on in here.

542
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:28,470
That's not a very good room, I think.

543
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:31,930
Yes.

544
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,310
Yeah, this seems like a basement or something.

545
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:38,750
I can read.

546
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,970
Second floor basement.

547
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:43,290
I can read.

548
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,390
Oh.

549
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:57,020
It seems like the place that is literally written in the
corner of the screen.

550
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,700
Vita for Reads.

551
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,840
I'm like gaming.

552
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,880
I'm not thinking about reading.

553
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,200
There has to be something in here.

554
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,420
Who would be running in the bathroom?

555
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,700
There's no space in here.

556
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,840
Also, these urinals seem very high up.

557
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,640
I don't know.

558
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:16,660
Oh.

559
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,240
Oh, oh, oh.

560
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:18,720
Freaky!

561
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,300
Freaky!

562
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:19,940
Freaky!

563
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:20,460
Freaky!

564
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,040
Freaky!

565
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,140
Freaky!

566
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,500
Looked it up.

567
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:29,060
You'd be lazily named time ghost.

568
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,340
Ooh, time ghost.

569
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,620
Okay, grandpa.

570
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:39,900
Shut up.

571
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,140
The sound was so goofy.

572
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:54,760
I guess what's easier about this, I'm assuming, than other
anomaly games is that a lot of anomaly games will like mess

573
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,660
with the writing or stuff like that.

574
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:09,700
um like this would change like really dramatically you know
or like or like subtle sometimes very subtly too and um and

575
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:21,700
uh so it's this seems easier maybe was that a purple face
wait oh oh multiple anomalies are currently detected at your

576
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,700
property okay i'm working on it

577
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,320
Wait.

578
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,200
Oh, that's scary.

579
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,980
You can control our hearts.

580
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh my god.

581
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:36,780
Oh my god.

582
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,600
Oh my god.

583
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,380
That's scary.

584
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,660
Oh my god.

585
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:41,500
That was freaky.

586
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,860
Ew, I just got rid of one.

587
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,280
The other one came like that.

588
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,040
Oh, that was freaky.

589
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:49,820
Oh.

590
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,480
Did you see that?

591
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:52,400
Oh, hello.

592
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:53,760
Oh,

593
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,020
yeah.

594
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:08,240
These ones are like spooky faces, so it seems a little more
like, you know, just find the spooky person than find every

595
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,440
tiny little detail that you could ever see ever.

596
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,020
Memorize literally every section.

597
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,800
We haven't had anything in here either.

598
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,760
No huge man.

599
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:24,820
Maybe it sucks.

600
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,260
Oh, I thought this was like a shadow of a...

601
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,500
older or something.

602
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:37,710
Also, this Kiken.

603
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,550
Dangerous.

604
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:40,730
Ooh, freaky.

605
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,570
My literate Oshi.

606
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,510
That's me.

607
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,940
You guys see anything?

608
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,380
No, again?

609
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:57,440
Oh my god.

610
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,720
Please.

611
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:01,900
Where?

612
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,820
Where are the ghosts?

613
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,200
Bottom right?

614
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,260
Where?

615
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,240
Where are you?

616
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:10,880
Blood on the floor.

617
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,500
Where?

618
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,580
This?

619
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,320
Is this blood?

620
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,060
I'm gonna report it.

621
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,440
No anomaly.

622
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:19,840
Okay.

623
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,220
But the false reporting seems to reset after you, uh...

624
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,820
After you, um, get a correct thing, so...

625
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,560
In the outside view.

626
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:33,680
Oh, okay.

627
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:34,360
I'll go back.

628
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,360
Again!

629
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:38,660
Oh!

630
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,900
How is this paranormal?

631
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,360
That's just a spider making his home.

632
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,740
I still...

633
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,120
Oh!

634
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,500
There is blood here.

635
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,320
Oh, good catch, guys.

636
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,440
Why is there an ambulance coming?

637
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,680
Wee-woo, wee-woo.

638
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:08,520
Good catch.

639
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,360
Good catch, good catch.

640
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:10,880
I didn't see that blood at all.

641
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,840
Door open in the basement?

642
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,360
Is it not supposed to be usually?

643
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:23,870
Hmm.

644
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:24,950
E!

645
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:25,510
Oh!

646
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:26,130
Whoa!

647
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,430
That was kind of sick.

648
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:34,750
Whoa!

649
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:37,490
Oh!

650
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:38,670
There's a face up there, you see him?

651
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,510
He's like chatting.

652
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:48,310
Aren't you guys glad that I look so cute and I don't look
like this at all?

653
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:51,870
I'm not so spooky all the time.

654
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,890
It's still pretty scary, but you know.

655
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:56,450
That was Chet.

656
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,590
What is it?

657
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:03,520
This door?

658
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,440
This door was not open before?

659
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:05,960
This one?

660
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,500
No anomaly detected.

661
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:12,880
That's okay.

662
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,360
It usually gives us the warning when there's four, I think
it was.

663
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,760
Biblically accurate mint.

664
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,780
That's okay, we can still check.

665
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:33,440
As long as we don't get five wrong in a row, then I think
we're usually good.

666
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,080
Okay.

667
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,530
10 minutes ago you said Phenomenon perfectly.

668
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:50,390
I could

669
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,880
say Phenomenon.

670
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,240
I can't not say for Mamma Man's name.

671
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,300
I can't say it.

672
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,320
Wait, was that a sound anomaly?

673
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,460
I get it, I get it.

674
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:11,060
Oh, there's a man up here!

675
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,880
Finally, something in here.

676
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,060
E!

677
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:21,580
E!

678
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,460
No worry, I got you.

679
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,600
Oh, the things that appear in the night vision, so scary.

680
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,760
I don't think I see it.

681
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,220
I keep looking at this guy, right?

682
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:41,800
I can't stop looking at him.

683
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,640
And this looks like hair to me.

684
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:44,040
You know what?

685
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,200
I'm gonna try reporting it, seeing if it's anything.

686
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:47,960
No, okay, no.

687
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:48,500
Oh!

688
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,640
You shouldn't be here.

689
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:51,680
Go away?

690
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:54,400
A real person is an anomaly?

691
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,340
Get the heck out of here?

692
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,300
You're trespassing?

693
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,260
I'm calling the cops.

694
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,560
There's like all this darkness here.

695
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,900
I'm going to report it too, but I don't think it's anything.

696
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:06,800
Okay.

697
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:08,120
That's all right.

698
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:08,420
Wait.

699
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:09,500
Okay.

700
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Yeah.

701
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,100
Minto phenomenon.

702
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,800
What are you trying to make me shy?

703
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:20,300
Wee!

704
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,020
Oh.

705
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:25,230
We're okay.

706
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:25,850
Maybe.

707
00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:27,170
Please don't kill me.

708
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:28,210
In the game.

709
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:29,770
I'm one of you.

710
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,210
Literally what are you?

711
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,670
I don't see anything.

712
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,110
I'd rather not!

713
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:40,510
Thank you so much for the phone.

714
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:41,050
Oh, Ted!

715
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,430
The Ted gift a thank you!

716
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,870
Oh my goodness, thank you so much.

717
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:46,150
For...

718
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:48,410
for... for mama made.

719
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,830
Phenomen made.

720
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,310
Oh my gosh, it's too difficult to say.

721
00:48:58,290 --> 00:48:58,770
What's that sound?

722
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:00,790
What's that sound?

723
00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:03,850
I don't like it, somebody stepped up to my camera.

724
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:06,790
Wait, big toilet.

725
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,610
See, I told you they were too small.

726
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,420
I'm looking for faces.

727
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,580
I feel like faces are the easiest thing.

728
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:29,620
Big skip.

729
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,520
Oh my gosh, it kind of sounds like Kayako.

730
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:43,430
Well, they took it from dispatch.

731
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:48,510
I mean, wouldn't you prefer like a lot of space.

732
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:53,270
A lot of room to aim.

733
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,190
Almost time.

734
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,930
We just got 10 minutes left.

735
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:07,740
Oh.

736
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,020
Oh, that's blood.

737
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,980
There's a bunch of blood down there.

738
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,110
Like I actually caught that one this time.

739
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:23,950
No matter how big the urinal is, someone will miss.

740
00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:26,470
Now ain't that just really sad.

741
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:27,270
Wait, what?

742
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:27,990
Oh!

743
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,840
Oh my goodness.

744
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,220
I missed one.

745
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,680
Object replacement in Cam4 toilet.

746
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,180
Huh.

747
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,540
I missed one.

748
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,220
I wonder what it could have been, though.

749
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,240
To Minto Phantom.

750
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:57,100
I wonder what it was.

751
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,640
Hmm.

752
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:58,640
Object replacement.

753
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,940
So that is a thing that happens.

754
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,620
What's the details?

755
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,560
Oh, look at that.

756
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,980
You get money based on everything you find.

757
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,900
This is in dollars, right?

758
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,360
Because if this is in yen, I'm getting paid pennies.

759
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,560
This is in dollars, right?

760
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,200
Yeah, we got paid 70 cents.

761
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:23,340
It's in yen.

762
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,740
Oh, gosh, I must be desperate.

763
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,940
All I could buy is a bubble gum or something.

764
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:32,380
Ouch.

765
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,680
Oh, some of them you get early bonuses too.

766
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:38,300
1.2.

767
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:38,760
Okay.

768
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,720
We're getting real strict about it.

769
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,440
Interesting.

770
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,980
D is nice.

771
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,720
Welcome to Mambuship.

772
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,540
Thank you.

773
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,400
You're an intern.

774
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,900
You get paid for exposure.

775
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,360
Yeah, I'm getting paid an exposure to the paranormal.

776
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,940
Exposure to creepy phenomena.

777
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:12,080
on but even if this were like if this were in dollars a
hundred and forty one dollars is kind of insane for this

778
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:27,740
kind of work that's kind of that's five hours of work for
141 dollars i'm almost due But don't say it like that.

779
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,900
It almost due for a bite kick in.

780
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:38,180
Good for a single day.

781
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:39,040
Maybe.

782
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,500
No hazard pay though.

783
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:43,700
I feel like you need the hazard pay, right, for this type of
job.

784
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:45,180
Let's select another property.

785
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,100
Am I just too good?

786
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,180
Let's see this one, the Totori residence.

787
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,480
Where a solitary death occurred.

788
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,680
It can't be that haunted then if only one person died there.

789
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,020
Just haunted?

790
00:52:59,240 --> 00:52:59,240
What?

791
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,880
He's gonna do the same thing over and over and over again?

792
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,100
Cree!

793
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:04,640
Thank you so much for four bonds!

794
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:08,680
He's just- I'm just gonna see the same guy over and over and
over again.

795
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:10,960
Does this include insurance?

796
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,500
It's a great quest.

797
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,740
Decent pay aside from potential monsters.

798
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:23,460
What we could do is we could try and do the harder mode too,
maybe.

799
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:24,920
Yeah.

800
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,100
Start to work.

801
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,020
Mr. Mothor!

802
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,220
Thank you so much for the five.

803
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:34,300
Oh, boy, golly.

804
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:35,880
All right.

805
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,940
I'm enjoying this single postcard that is on the wall.

806
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:41,850
Let's skip this.

807
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:43,940
All right.

808
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,720
What's the unknown altar?

809
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:50,960
I wonder.

810
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,780
Oh.

811
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:57,980
This place is tight.

812
00:53:58,780 --> 00:53:59,220
Holy cow.

813
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,300
Small, small.

814
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,800
Happy 21 Months Milestone.

815
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,300
The Thorias Bastard!

816
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,280
Thank you!

817
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,520
Oh my god.

818
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,500
I could be in that tub.

819
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:11,600
Ooh, I don't like this view at all.

820
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,560
Ooh, I don't like it at all.

821
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,360
What does that say?

822
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,160
Eye, heart?

823
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:17,460
Hawaii?

824
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,280
Okay.

825
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:24,620
Alright.

826
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,260
Let's go.

827
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,020
Searching around.

828
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,720
For some spooky things.

829
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,300
Did they have a chat?

830
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:41,560
Maybe it was like a grandma or grandpa that would have their
like grandchild come over and, you know.

831
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,840
Something like that.

832
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,640
This is like really, oh my gosh.

833
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:49,880
How much do I have?

834
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,480
Ooh, I don't like the bathtub.

835
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,920
Oh, oh, oh, my bad.

836
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:55,320
Sorry.

837
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:56,720
Scared me.

838
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,300
I need to be warm.

839
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,200
To all employees.

840
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:09,620
this is the time when there are many reports of abnormal
phenomena okay so they give you about 30 seconds to check

841
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:22,360
everything that's pretty nice it's dirty too yeah it's not
so good what was that how's the sound by the way i know that

842
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:29,760
it's like a pretty low game because it's just like ambiance
but if you need me to if you want me to turn it up let me

843
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:37,740
know It's good but good for...

844
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,100
It's quiet but good for loud sounds.

845
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:39,560
It's good.

846
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:39,880
It's good.

847
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:40,320
Okay, cool.

848
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,440
Thank you, guys.

849
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,320
Oh, this was not read before.

850
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,340
Right?

851
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,140
Yeah, that's strange.

852
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,220
The toy.

853
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,560
Something up with the toy?

854
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:54,760
This one?

855
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:58,440
Was this here before?

856
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,020
This definitely has nothing happening, was it?

857
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:10,840
Yeah, it was there.

858
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,060
Okay.

859
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,040
What's it gonna say?

860
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,560
How do you even make anything?

861
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:19,800
Why do you have a table here in the middle of your kitchen?

862
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,760
Oh, oh, that's not good.

863
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,600
Oh, oh, oh, grandma.

864
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,840
I kind of wanted to see what would happen, though.

865
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,740
Maybe I should have let her come up.

866
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
She was just crawling up the stairs.

867
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:35,960
Grandma.

868
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:54,350
what it's hard sometimes because it like lights it up so
much that it seems like things are moving you know what i

869
00:56:54,350 --> 00:57:10,980
mean what was that what broke she don't need your help up
the stairs oh my god oh my god that one actually got me

870
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:16,260

871
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,600
Grandpa, please.

872
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:34,000
She was like, this is me not needing your stinking help
going up the stairs.

873
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:35,720
Youngster?

874
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:36,800
Oof.

875
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,140
That's not good.

876
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,800
That's some black mold.

877
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,740
Grandma had no midnight snacks.

878
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,660
This is like crazy.

879
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,920
So much stuff in this room.

880
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:58,360
Yeah, they were handprints.

881
00:57:59,240 --> 00:57:59,340
Creepy.

882
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,040
Okay.

883
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,120
Now every time I click the night vision mode, I'm freaking
out.

884
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,620
I'm freaking out a little bit.

885
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:13,880
Blood on the door.

886
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,020
Here?

887
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,660
I don't think...

888
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:23,640
Grandma, what did I tell you about acting like a baby?

889
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:27,360
We're done with this role play.

890
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:31,520
I don't want to do it anymore.

891
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:35,660
Bobby.

892
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,160
Why did all people like regress back to babies?

893
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:42,960
Oh!

894
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:43,480
Oh!

895
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,220
Do you think he's a danger?

896
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,860
No, I don't think he's so much worth the take.

897
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,720
It was Grandpa doing the baby roleplay.

898
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,200
Oh, my bad.

899
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:55,960
No, no.

900
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:56,500
We'll get rid of him.

901
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:57,180
We'll get rid of him.

902
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:01,020
Okay.

903
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:20,920
I know we would die if we don't report them but like some of
them I just want to see

904
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:35,180
some of them I want to see what happens I'm not ready for a
smooch That was a true Gachi Koi distance.

905
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,280
Grandma loves her being in front of the camera.

906
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,540
She is constantly...

907
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:43,320
Wait, what other ones then are there?

908
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,000
Oh.

909
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,540
Because it said multiple.

910
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,200
Birthday was on Monday.

911
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,800
Artemis, happy birthday!

912
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,680
Happy belated birthday!

913
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,540
We're missing a couple things, guys.

914
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,340
So we gotta lock in a bit.

915
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,080
Besides, like, the obvious stuff.

916
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,950
Wait, sorry.

917
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,830
Scanning?

918
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:20,270
The painting?

919
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:22,030
This one?

920
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,320
Multiple anomalies!

921
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,160
Oh!

922
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,420
Oh!

923
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:35,960
Oh!

924
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,120
Oh my god, that's freaky!

925
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,260
Wait, that was so good!

926
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:43,640
Oh.

927
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:46,800
There's more dust than normal.

928
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,020
That was so crazy.

929
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,770
Every time I turn it on, I think this is like a person
standing there, you know.

930
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:02,150
Orbs?

931
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:03,550
Yeah, dust.

932
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,950
You mean dust?

933
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,550
Suddenly a beard.

934
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:11,710
Who's going to be in this?

935
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:13,130
I almost said the toilet.

936
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:15,350
Who's going to be in that tub, I wonder?

937
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:23,070
It was white.

938
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:23,850
This one?

939
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,610
Oh, it was?

940
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,350
Oh my gosh.

941
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:31,870
Oh my gosh.

942
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:33,170
You guys got it.

943
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:33,990
Oh wow.

944
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,250
I would have missed that.

945
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:39,170
Oh, nice catch.

946
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:43,790
Nice catch.

947
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:45,630
Oh, oh, oh.

948
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:48,830
Good catch, everybody.

949
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,550
I think every time you hear- You hear a noise?

950
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:01,610
I think it's like something's going on.

951
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:03,490
Wait, but somebody ran by!

952
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:07,570
Oh my god.

953
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,010
That's scary.

954
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:12,710
Maybe Grandpa Baby could fit in the tub.

955
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:18,710
I would need to get paid for babysitting if that were the
case.

956
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:24,210
Babysitter's charge a pretty penny that they do.

957
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,630
I was too slow.

958
01:02:29,870 --> 01:02:31,710
I'm catching that guy.

959
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:34,970
What are your rates?

960
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,810
A bajillion dollars.

961
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:47,890
But yeah, I think every time you hear a sound, that's like
something's going on in another camera, you know?

962
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,850
Oh, I don't like that sound.

963
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,550
Okay.

964
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,360
Wait, what's...

965
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:07,780
Sorry.

966
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:10,060
Muay Thai gym.

967
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,060
Can't wait to be a deadly abu.

968
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,000
Thanks for the confidence to join.

969
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,580
Props to your apparition homie.

970
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:17,540
Kampa!

971
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,740
Good luck at the gym!

972
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,100
You got this.

973
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,820
The curtain opened.

974
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:24,480
This one?

975
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,560
No.

976
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,260
Oh my god!

977
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:32,820
Grandpa!

978
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,060
He's a farmer!

979
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:40,160
Cam 7 folder.

980
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,520
Cam 1 heater.

981
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,720
What are you talking about, heater?

982
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:48,880
I hardly even know where.

983
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,120
There is no- Oh, this thing?

984
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:51,760
Oh, it's on!

985
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,600
Oh my gosh!

986
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,260
We're gonna burn down the whole place!

987
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,160
I don't even notice.

988
01:03:59,340 --> 01:04:00,080
It's just like normal.

989
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,560
This always looks like this from what I remember.

990
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:09,760
Like, I remember the guy, the picture, and then the document
kind of being blurred out.

991
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,840
I do remember that.

992
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:15,420
Grandma is cold.

993
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,280
Well, grandma can stay cold.

994
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:19,360
She's a ghost now.

995
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,340
That's kind of how we are.

996
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,940
So I can see that she's doing her morning exercise.

997
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,340
ghost activity.

998
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:41,160
Okay.

999
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:44,440
That's how I wake up too.

1000
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:49,040
Gengi na ovae-chan da na.

1001
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:50,560
She died

1002
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,980
even though she's dead, she's still so even though she's
dead, she's still so full of energy.

1003
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,020
No!

1004
01:05:11,860 --> 01:05:12,720
GENKY SOGIR!

1005
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,760
Never, no, no.

1006
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:34,220
She was just jamming in the bedroom.

1007
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,860
Get done!

1008
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
Tuna!

1009
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:39,640
Kiboshi!

1010
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,160
I think somebody's in the kitchen.

1011
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:01,760
Oh,

1012
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,570
you don't have to wash the dishes anymore.

1013
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:14,030
I think the cabinet has always been open.

1014
01:06:14,210 --> 01:06:15,590
Because I've kind of been looking in there.

1015
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:18,090
Maybe to see if there's like a face.

1016
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:23,310
that will start peeking out from there or something.

1017
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:29,470
I don't like this area because it's like so dark.

1018
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:31,910
It's pretty scary.

1019
01:06:32,290 --> 01:06:33,270
4 a.m.

1020
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:37,030
Oh my gosh, guys, we're killing it.

1021
01:06:37,850 --> 01:06:39,230
Sync color is not red.

1022
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:40,590
Was it red before?

1023
01:06:40,950 --> 01:06:41,410
Wait, what?

1024
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:45,370
I just heard someone running.

1025
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,870
I just heard some running.

1026
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:49,950
Oh,

1027
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:54,170
was it?

1028
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:56,170
I don't know.

1029
01:06:57,110 --> 01:06:58,890
Ah, nice.

1030
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:02,230
Everything keeps turning right in this place.

1031
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:06,050
Oh, maybe this cabinet is what someone was referring to
earlier.

1032
01:07:06,630 --> 01:07:08,150
I'm not sure if it was open or not before.

1033
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:11,530
Nothing in here still?

1034
01:07:12,830 --> 01:07:13,190
Eee!

1035
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:14,570
Eee!

1036
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:25,730
Who are you?

1037
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,770
Who are you?

1038
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:33,630
We've only had grandma and everyone before.

1039
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,610
Wondering Taco!

1040
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,570
Thank you so much for the hand-gifted!

1041
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,550
Granddaughter, the whole family is here.

1042
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:48,570
Oh,

1043
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,840
I saw this reflection and thought it was something.

1044
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,260
I don't think it is.

1045
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:10,300
Does this look darker than before or am I crazy?

1046
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,500
I think I'm crazy.

1047
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,660
The red on the futons as well?

1048
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:17,820
Oh, the painting!

1049
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:19,100
It's actually changed.

1050
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,020
sofa wasn't yellow oh wow it's like really bright yellow

1051
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:42,370
the sofa has always been yellow apparently has it been that
bright oh there's some feet here

1052
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:55,680
banana sofa some things you just like kind of accept and so
you don't really like think about it that it's that that

1053
01:08:55,680 --> 01:09:02,380
like oh you're like oh wait i i've seen this before but i

1055
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:16,000

1056
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,920

1061
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:15,290
I wonder if when we get through all three of these, if this
will unlock, or if it's like a...

1062
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:29,540
I forgot to say during the review stream, but I wanted to
mention the print I used as a mat on my Madi Incentro self.

1063
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:33,220
Shelf was by Ayami Mama.

1064
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,100
Oh, nice!

1065
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,160
Deadboard!

1066
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,760
Welcome to Mambusha.

1067
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,720
Thank you!

1068
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:41,400
Oh, gosh.

1069
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,920
Now my nose is all clogged with ectoplasm.

1070
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,400
Turns out grandma's not the ghost.

1071
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,680
We just keep kicking her out of the house.

1072
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:05,680
Yeah.

1073
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:08,480
Ugh.

1074
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:11,560
She's like, I ain't dead yet.

1075
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,900
She's like, I still live here.

1076
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:20,620
Let's

1077
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:25,960
see the other one.

1078
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,180
Grandma, your name is Arthur Lee's.

1079
01:11:30,900 --> 01:11:35,040
Hotel Selene, an abandoned lodging facility.

1080
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:39,780
Yeah.

1081
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,000
Ooh, skip, skip, skip, skip.

1082
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:49,820
Alright, we have 30 seconds to observe this place.

1083
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,540
What a creepy hallway.

1084
01:11:54,980 --> 01:12:01,260
What is it?

1085
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,780
Why is it censored?

1086
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:03,780
Oh!

1087
01:12:06,860 --> 01:12:08,180
Sexy bedrooms!

1088
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:09,820
Wow.

1089
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,690
Why are they censored?

1090
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,150
Red!

1091
01:12:15,530 --> 01:12:17,210
Okay, so this room is red.

1092
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:18,350
This room is gold.

1093
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:19,750
It's yellow.

1094
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:21,130
Red.

1095
01:12:22,610 --> 01:12:24,810
Oh, there's the pregnant lady.

1096
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,260
I should be paying attention and not staring at her.

1097
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:35,960
Oh, okay.

1098
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:38,180
So there's eight cameras.

1099
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,100
Ew, this place is disgusting.

1100
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:49,620
I was trying to read what it said.

1101
01:12:49,680 --> 01:13:01,840

1104
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:25,710

1105
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:26,580
Oh!

1106
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:27,340
Lady.

1107
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:32,240
Now we have Lady.

1108
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:34,720
Um...

1109
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:35,180
Okay.

1110
01:13:35,660 --> 01:13:37,320
That was really fast.

1111
01:13:39,180 --> 01:13:41,460
That was like really fast.

1112
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:46,040
It says Red Village.

1113
01:13:47,680 --> 01:13:48,600
Was that always there?

1114
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,100
Okay, it was.

1115
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:53,600
I hear something.

1116
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,600
I think something is like about.

1117
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,180
Something is about.

1118
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,780
At least this one is a pretty obvious hallway.

1119
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:08,840
This one scares me though.

1120
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,640
I don't like it.

1121
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:21,430
This look like two little like ghost children sitting.

1122
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:23,550
Okay.

1123
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,210
There's an eye in that room.

1124
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:27,770
In here?

1125
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,250
Is this an eye?

1126
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,170
I don't think so.

1127
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:38,210
I think that was always there before.

1128
01:14:39,610 --> 01:14:40,610
Doesn't look like one.

1129
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:46,880
Boy!

1130
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,620
We have another lady.

1131
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,320
Khorus, everybody likes this.

1132
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:03,940
This room.

1133
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:04,940
Oh my gosh.

1134
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,460
Wait, the flowers are new.

1135
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:10,600
This is so distracting because it looks like movement, you
know?

1136
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,200
She having a bit of a chuckle.

1137
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,500
Oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, eh, eh.

1138
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:16,940
Oh, what's so funny?

1139
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:21,740
What's so funny?

1140
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:25,020
I keep saying this and it looks like lumps of like a body,
you know?

1141
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:27,680
Ah, freaky.

1142
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:29,340
Freaky, freaky.

1143
01:15:33,140 --> 01:15:34,360
Their sisters?

1144
01:15:34,940 --> 01:15:34,980
Oh.

1145
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,780
Oh, what's going on in here?

1146
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:38,260
Oh my god!

1147
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:39,080
Bugs!

1148
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,480
Moths!

1149
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,040
Where'd they go?

1150
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:52,600
A total moth attack!

1151
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:56,180
I'm gonna see if this is anything.

1152
01:15:58,760 --> 01:15:59,400
No.

1153
01:16:03,470 --> 01:16:04,610
Something's going on.

1154
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:10,320
The bugs are back.

1155
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:12,980
The bugs are back in town.

1156
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,500
Bugs are back in town.

1157
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,460
The bugs are back in town Bugs are back in town

1158
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:32,530
Oh baby Baby shadow

1159
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:38,810
Get out of here on my Torah Yeah so true

1160
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:54,340
Hmm Karaoke is next stream Sorry I'll never sing ever again
in a stream that is not karaoke.

1161
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,480
I don't like how

1162
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,560
these rooms look so similar.

1163
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,840
You guys hear that?

1164
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:10,800
That one I don't like.

1165
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:14,500
I don't... Oh gosh, I keep thinking this is a Silent Hill
monster.

1166
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,740
What is that?

1167
01:17:20,180 --> 01:17:21,280
Oh, she's singing.

1168
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,820
Oh, I'm getting closer to it.

1169
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:27,900
Oh my god, she's brushing her hair!

1170
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,420
You look, you look beautiful.

1171
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,780
That's mom.

1172
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:47,360
That's mommy.

1173
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:50,620
Ooh.

1174
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:57,080
Someone's knocking.

1175
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:59,640
Wait, was this already there?

1176
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,300
No.

1177
01:18:03,620 --> 01:18:04,740
Or yes, it was.

1178
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:05,600
I guess.

1179
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:08,000
It's so bright.

1180
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:12,660
Knock, knock, hello.

1181
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:15,820
Who is it?

1182
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,120
This place looks chill.

1183
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:18,760
You think so?

1184
01:18:21,240 --> 01:18:24,220
Even though we got attacked by moths, literally in this
room.

1185
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:27,700
Uh-oh.

1186
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,620
Alright, guys, we gotta lock in.

1187
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:31,960
There's, like, so many things.

1188
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,340
Everything is, like, so dirty.

1189
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:35,560
It's hard to see it, like, if there'd be a...

1190
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:35,800
Oh!

1191
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,790
Sometimes the anomaly is just...

1192
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,970
Literally just staring you in the face.

1193
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:49,270
Oh.

1194
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:52,750
Ooh, that one's freaking.

1195
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,330
Some anomalies are easier than others.

1196
01:18:57,450 --> 01:18:58,130
Yeah, exactly.

1197
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:00,550
so funny.

1198
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:08,070
That one was so silly.

1199
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:10,070
I wonder what we'll get in here.

1200
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:12,030
This room's creepy.

1201
01:19:15,390 --> 01:19:18,990
I'm like waiting to see someone standing in one of these
windows.

1202
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,680
I am too scared of baby.

1203
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:29,120
Are you saying you're too baby?

1204
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:34,380
Are you saying You were too, baby.

1205
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,140
There's a kid, little baby.

1206
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:38,240
It's okay.

1207
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,200
Anomalies get a bit quirky.

1208
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:45,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1209
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,120
Multiple anomalies are detected.

1210
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,500
You guys hear that?

1211
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,780
Like, there's someone stepping on glass.

1212
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:57,860
Oh!

1213
01:19:58,360 --> 01:19:59,640
The lady's gone.

1214
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,680
The sensor is gone!

1215
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:02,940
Oh!

1216
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,400
Crunchy.

1217
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,640
Hold on, it's gotta be one of the rooms, right?

1218
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:13,080
Oh, the whole...

1219
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:13,960
They took the bed!

1220
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:19,990
No more pregnant.

1221
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:23,890
They took the whole bed!

1222
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:25,050
That's a crime!

1223
01:20:26,150 --> 01:20:27,390
That's not even an anomaly.

1224
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:29,670
They're just straight up stealing.

1225
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:34,370
Alright, now.

1226
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:36,770
Invisible bed.

1227
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:38,390
Invisible bed.

1228
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:54,650
bed freaky ghost bed yeah yeah yeah yeah nothing outside yet

Oh, you're so right.

1232
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:20,870
There must be something I'm missing that's so obvious.

1233
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:27,830
It just looked kind of like it belonged there.

1234
01:21:30,230 --> 01:21:32,150
The baby was too cute to be scary.

1235
01:21:32,290 --> 01:21:33,510
I know he looks so happy.

1236
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:37,570
He's just a happy baby.

1237
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:42,390
I don't like this area.

1238
01:21:42,590 --> 01:21:43,410
It's so dark.

1239
01:21:45,850 --> 01:21:47,030
Something scary.

1240
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:50,990
Oh, that means something outside is happening.

1241
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:54,410
Oh, yeah.

1242
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:55,450
What is happening?

1243
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:01,350
Red paint on cam 7.

1244
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:06,140
Oh, it's always been red.

1245
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:07,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1246
01:22:08,620 --> 01:22:09,960
That's always been red.

1247
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:11,640
Wee-woo.

1248
01:22:14,020 --> 01:22:17,540
He looked like that one Pokemon.

1249
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:20,000
Like saw.

1250
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:22,020
Sock on.

1251
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:25,600
That's what he looked like.

1252
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,260
Oh.

1253
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:42,180
Ew, he's burnt.

1254
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:51,820
Forest in the shower.

1255
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,380
Forest in the shower.

1256
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:03,850
Oh!

1257
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,910
This?

1258
01:23:07,950 --> 01:23:09,490
Oh my gosh.

1259
01:23:10,870 --> 01:23:12,390
Fire in the water.

1260
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,470
It just looked like a window to me.

1261
01:23:16,290 --> 01:23:17,730
Wow, that was a good catch.

1262
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:19,450
That was a really good catch.

1263
01:23:19,470 --> 01:23:20,010
Good catch.

1264
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:22,970
That's so funny.

1265
01:23:23,830 --> 01:23:24,710
Was that a dead woman?

1266
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:26,190
Well, it's a...

1267
01:23:26,190 --> 01:23:26,430
I was...

1268
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:27,290
There's a lot of dead people.

1269
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,430
Are you talking about me?

1270
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:31,450
I'm the dead woman.

1271
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,660
These rooms are tricky for me.

1272
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:50,000
Oh my god!

1273
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:52,120
That is a lady in the bathroom.

1274
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,340
And I don't like that.

1275
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,940
The boiler was opening.

1276
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:58,280
Oh it was?

1277
01:23:59,140 --> 01:23:59,620
Oh!

1278
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,060
Oh!

1279
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:00,620
There's a hand!

1280
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,340
Oh my gosh, you guys are so right.

1281
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:04,440
Creepy.

1282
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,780
Hand in the boiler.

1283
01:24:06,440 --> 01:24:07,980
Lady in the shower.

1284
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,860
Water in the fire.

1285
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:19,570
Get back in there.

1286
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:21,490
Back.

1287
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:22,670
Back, ghost.

1288
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:24,570
Get back.

1289
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,050
Get back in the shower, you smell.

1290
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:30,990
Oh my gosh, we're already at four.

1291
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:33,870
Oh, she's looking at me.

1292
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:38,310
I didn't do that.

1293
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:41,650
I didn't do that.

1294
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,290
I don't take responsibility.

1295
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:49,470
The blue graffiti outside looks off.

1296
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:51,130
I can try it.

1297
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:52,450
I don't think so, though.

1298
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:53,830
No.

1299
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:07,860
This is exactly how I react to my crush.

1300
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:10,180
You tell her she's stinky?

1301
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:12,720
Isn't that...

1302
01:25:12,720 --> 01:25:13,920
Oh, wait, this is also...

1303
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:14,600
Right?

1304
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:15,980
It's not supposed to be open here.

1305
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:17,200
Yeah.

1306
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,340
Isn't it like being mean to your...

1307
01:25:21,340 --> 01:25:22,020
To your...

1308
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:25,320
Like to someone you're into.

1309
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,960
Isn't that supposed to be a dating tactic?

1310
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:30,220
But...

1311
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,820
Or like some sort of tactic.

1312
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:36,750
Eee!

1313
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:37,570
Uh oh.

1314
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:39,090
Somebody's inside.

1315
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:42,250
Oh!

1316
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:43,530
She's inside.

1317
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:45,110
She's inside.

1318
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:46,790
Oh.

1319
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:49,050
You are haunting the wrong place.

1320
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:51,290
Go back to the first location.

1321
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:52,510
Oh my gosh.

1322
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,530
What if the, like the, what's it called?

1323
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:55,590
It's close by.

1324
01:25:59,350 --> 01:26:02,230
The rest stop that she was haunting before.

1325
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:07,130
All these ghosts think something's really funny.

1326
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:09,290
And I think I'm not in on the joke.

1327
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:11,730
And I'm really upset about it.

1328
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:13,750
I would like to know.

1329
01:26:14,110 --> 01:26:15,030
I'm getting FOMO.

1330
01:26:16,830 --> 01:26:18,110
because I will understand.

1331
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,150
No, dummy.

1332
01:26:22,910 --> 01:26:24,470
Why are you called dummy for?

1333
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:28,170
Maybe she's haunting me?

1334
01:26:28,770 --> 01:26:30,770
Maybe we did kind of get ourselves a girl.

1335
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,170
Maybe being mean to them does work.

1336
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:38,490
Ghost bottom right.

1337
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:46,160
Affirmative.

1338
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,480
Face in the wall?

1339
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,400
KM2 face?

1340
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:50,340
Oh.

1341
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:51,600
Oh.

1342
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:16,920

popping out She was just peeking.

1345
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:33,160
What a voyeur.

1346
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:34,720
Pervert.

1347
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:36,840
You pervert.

1348
01:27:37,780 --> 01:27:37,800

And Ghost Camp 2 Isle.

1353
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,530
I thought, what?

1354
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,370
Maybe it had just appeared.

1355
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:56,610
I did hear, like, a knocking.

1356
01:27:57,050 --> 01:27:59,230
As soon as I, as soon as the day.

1357
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,090
They stopped so.

Alright guys.

1393
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:50,880

I can't stop looking at this dog.

1428
01:33:02,720 --> 01:33:03,600
Oh, there's blood here.

1429
01:33:07,940 --> 01:33:09,160
And also someone knocking.

1430

Hello?

1432
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:16,340
Somebody knocking at a door.

What the heck?

1434
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:31,110

1435
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:34,850
Who could that be?

1436
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:37,810
Hold on.

1437
01:33:38,050 --> 01:33:40,490
Oh, I'm searching for... Oh, oh, oh!

1438
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,660
With the man face!

1439
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:47,560
That's like a popular yokai.

1440
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:50,480
What's it?

1441
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,980
Oh gosh, what's her name again?

1442
01:33:54,900 --> 01:33:55,840
The dog.

1443
01:34:00,980 --> 01:34:02,400
Yeah, it's a yokai.

1444
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,540
He got that dog in him.

1445
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:11,700
He embraced...

1446
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:14,580
That's what happens when you really embrace the dog in you.

1447
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:16,780
You become the dog.

1448
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:17,320
Oh!

1449
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:24,370
They handle exotic animals too, it seems.

1450
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:27,810
Why is there an elephant?

1451
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:29,570
Address him!

1452
01:34:30,150 --> 01:34:33,150
The elephant is in the room.

1453
01:34:35,890 --> 01:34:36,910
Address me.

1454
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:43,070
What if everybody What if everybody thinks he's saying
Address me?

1455
01:34:43,410 --> 01:34:47,430
But he's really Saying Undress Me

1456
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:54,960
Side eye dog Stay in the same

1457
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:07,720

Cool, cool, cool.

1460
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:19,500
Look at these cats.

1461
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,060
I can't stop looking at them, too.

1462
01:35:21,180 --> 01:35:22,880
They're so cute, cuddled in.

1463
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,780
Oh, I miss my cats.

1464
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,020
They're just in the other room.

1465
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,680
Oh, calendar was always like that, right?

1466
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,580
I think so.

1467
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:34,820
It was always kind of folded.

1468
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:41,480
Did you play Zucosis?

1469
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:42,340
No.

1470
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:58,080

with Fumoko dolls.

1473
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,140
I asked them if they needed help taking photos because I was
doing the same thing with my beat doll.

1474
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:21,660
They recognized you immediately.

1475
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,460
Oh my gosh!

1476
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:24,480
Skeletons!

1477
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,860
That was so fun.

1478
01:36:27,780 --> 01:36:27,940
Oh.

1479
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,740
Wait, does this not pause the game?

1480
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:31,320
Oh, shoot.

1481
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,240

I keep saying this guy here too.

1492
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:27,790
I don't know if it's like the yokai band face dog guy.

1493
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:29,890
The arm?

1494
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:31,270
You got...

1495
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:33,870
Wait, is it an actual arm now?

1496
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:37,330
Oh, it is.

1497
01:37:38,150 --> 01:37:40,710
It became... it went from mannequin to real arm.

1498
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:44,390
That's silly.

1499
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:46,430
That's really silly.

1500
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:52,050
I hope you're okay.

1501
01:37:52,330 --> 01:37:53,110
I hope you're feeling better.

1502
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:59,550
I'm glad that my gaming could help you out a little bit.

1503
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:02,410
Hmm.

1504
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:06,350
Hmm.

1505
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:09,010
We haven't had anything in this room.

1506
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,610
Oh my gosh.

1507
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,290
Multiple anomalies.

1508
01:38:14,410 --> 01:38:14,750
Where?

1509
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:18,090
Where?

1510
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:21,150
I'm not really locked in for this one.

1511
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:21,870
Sorry.

1512
01:38:25,470 --> 01:38:26,790
Were the handcuffs?

1513
01:38:26,930 --> 01:38:29,270
I did see those on the ground.

1514
01:38:29,590 --> 01:38:30,630
These things, right?

1515
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:31,930
I don't think they were here before.

1516
01:38:32,250 --> 01:38:32,930
What are they?

1517
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:35,450
What is that?

1518
01:38:36,270 --> 01:38:40,950
Okay, I'm glad that you also saw it because I was hovering
over it.

1519
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:45,550
I was hovering over it.

1520
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:48,150
Like, I should maybe get it or something, you know?

1521
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:54,270
They were just handcuffs.

1522
01:38:56,990 --> 01:38:59,870
Why do you have to go off immediately when I press the
button?

1523
01:39:01,730 --> 01:39:06,570
This one is a little less active, it feels.

1524
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:10,030
An invisible man.

1525
01:39:12,990 --> 01:39:16,550
I don't think the chain thing in the cage was always there
either.

1526
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:22,910
Also, I'm going to click on the neck so that you guys if...
Maybe... Yeah, see?

1527
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:23,930
It's not an anomaly.

1528
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:26,850
This thing?

1529
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:32,550
Uh, this is just a water catcher, so I don't see why it
would be an anomaly.

1530
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:36,590
This is like when the, when the, when it rains and stuff.

1531
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:38,230
It's just to catch the water.

1532
01:39:39,170 --> 01:39:41,310
Unless he meant a different chain.

1533
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:41,990
Um,

1534
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:47,390
has to, whoa!

1535
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:49,610
I was about to say there has to be something in here!

1536
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:53,690
Oh my god, that was crazy.

1537
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:56,950
Kind of looks like a sneak.

1538
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:00,950
But it's right in front of us.

1539
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,400
In here?

1540
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:13,120
Here?

1541
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:15,500
Where is it?

1542
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:17,540
Where did that sound come from?

1543
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:23,290
Ah!

1544
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:24,250
Sorry.

1545
01:40:32,030 --> 01:40:34,170
Was that a face under the table?

1546
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,430
On the left.

1547
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:42,090
I don't see anything.

1548
01:40:42,230 --> 01:40:42,790
Oh my gosh.

1549
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,650
More multiple anomalies!

1550
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:46,630
Please!

1551
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,110
I feel like I'm gonna die on this one.

1552
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:54,090
Ah!

1553
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:55,630
Please!

1554
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,170
Come out, come out wherever you are!

1555
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:00,530
Huh?

1556
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:03,350
Oh!

1557
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:04,410
I see him.

1558
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:11,900
Manikin has a real hand.

1559
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:12,720
Not anymore!

1560
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:14,920
To our employees, hey don't skip me, what are you?

1561
01:41:23,950 --> 01:41:35,170
everything's so cluttered i can't tell we haven't had
anything in this room either or maybe we have oh oh that's

1562
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:37,710
that's the worst i don't like that one at all

1563
01:41:42,190 --> 01:41:55,410
that one was terrible standing here i realized multiple
again oh my god Gosh, guys.

1564
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:06,210
The folds in the cat calendar?

1565
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:07,370
Are they really?

1566
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:10,310
I noticed that too.

1567
01:42:10,610 --> 01:42:11,150
Okay, yeah.

1568
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:12,910
It's not an anomaly, though.

1569
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:17,090
Do you ever think about how they get rid of anomalies in
these games?

1570
01:42:17,250 --> 01:42:18,630
I do think about that.

1571
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:19,290
Like, what do they?

1572
01:42:19,530 --> 01:42:20,490
What is the procedure?

1573
01:42:22,170 --> 01:42:23,910
Oh, my God.

1574
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,900
We didn't make it, right?

1575
01:42:47,120 --> 01:42:48,060
We still get paid.

1576
01:42:50,900 --> 01:43:03,240

Let's try again.

01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:25,720
Object replacement.

1581
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:29,680
And then it also said in here in the cage.

1582
01:43:31,620 --> 01:43:32,560
Accident scene.

1583
01:43:33,460 --> 01:43:34,500
I just noticed that.

1584
01:43:34,860 --> 01:43:35,060
Scary.

1585
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:36,900
Okay, excuse me.

1586
01:43:37,060 --> 01:43:37,300
Go away.

1587
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:38,700
Behind operating room.

1588
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:39,480
Reception.

1589
01:43:40,140 --> 01:43:41,220
This is a reception.

1590
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,140
How are we supposed to get anything done?

1591
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:46,780
Door opening, closing in the operating room.

1592
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:48,560
Is there a door in here?

1593
01:43:50,820 --> 01:43:51,340
Huh.

1594
01:43:56,540 --> 01:44:00,080

It's a lion!

1599
01:44:08,100 --> 01:44:12,420
Oh, I saw it angry and didn't realize it wasn't supposed to
be angry, though.

1600
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,720
Ah, okay, okay.

1601
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:17,500

Or don't.

1612
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,460
That's okay with me too.

1613
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:15,980
Show it.

1614
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:16,420
Oh!

1615
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:17,840
Hand.

1616
01:45:29,260 --> 01:45:30,140
I've done better.

1617
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:32,160
I have to listen to it.

1618
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:33,700
And then I would really be able to get it.

1619
01:45:33,720 --> 01:45:34,400
I promise.

1620
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:45,460
Godzilla.

1621
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,260
Why were there handcuffs?

1622
01:45:53,460 --> 01:45:54,160
I guess...

1623
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:59,780
Maybe because it was the accident scene is what it's called.

1624
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:01,160
Maybe that's why the...

1625
01:46:03,020 --> 01:46:03,780
The...

1626
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:04,580
What's it called?

1627
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:08,140
The handcuffs were there in that.

We're getting new ones this time, that's cool!

1637
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,340

You know?

1639
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,200
Lady in red.

01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:44,750
I hear something.

1641
01:47:45,370 --> 01:47:46,170
Very faint.

1642
01:47:53,330 --> 01:47:53,850
Oh.

1643
01:47:55,250 --> 01:47:57,070
Why is the cat angry?

1644
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,350
Is there a wire in cam 2?

1645
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,550
Hold on, we'll get there.

1646
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:10,080
A wire in cam 2.

1647
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:13,980
Oh, the hand!

1648
01:48:19,570 --> 01:48:20,770
Because cat...

1649
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:22,010
Skulls in cam 2?

1650
01:48:23,110 --> 01:48:25,190
There's always been skulls here, no?

1651
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:27,570
I'll report them.

1652
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:30,330
Yeah, they've always been there.

1653
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,550
A wire.

1654
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:36,470

her.

1657
01:49:10,610 --> 01:49:10,630
Oh.

1658
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:16,450
I guess maybe the person that died here?

1659
01:49:17,550 --> 01:49:17,890
Boo.

1660
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:24,310
That was freaky.

1661
01:49:28,510 --> 01:49:30,450
Hope you're having fun with the spooks.

1662
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,170
It's spooky for sure.

1663
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:35,170
Thanks for the hot dog.

1664
01:49:36,010 --> 01:49:36,870
Hot dog.

1665
01:49:37,390 --> 01:49:38,190
Hot dog.

1666
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:43,130
That one was Pretty spooky.

1667
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:50,370
Forget who, I guess the lady that died here, I'm assuming.

1668
01:49:50,710 --> 01:49:53,170
It's a lady's dog with the side eye.

1669
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:55,010
So funny.

1670
01:49:56,810 --> 01:49:58,130
It's just not angry.

1671
01:49:59,130 --> 01:50:00,570
Little lion isn't angry.

1672
01:50:03,070 --> 01:50:03,370
Right.

1673
01:50:03,910 --> 01:50:04,110
Oh!

1674
01:50:05,410 --> 01:50:06,570
What was that sound?

1675
01:50:06,970 --> 01:50:07,810
What was that?

1676
01:50:07,850 --> 01:50:08,310
This thing?

1677
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:14,870
I was talking about having Godzilla as a pet and I can't
help but remember the 90s Godzilla...

1678
01:50:14,870 --> 01:50:15,650
Oh, there he is.

1679
01:50:16,050 --> 01:50:22,050
The 90s Godzilla animated series, which basically had that
concept, which is awesome, by the way.

1680
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:23,970
Godzilla as a pet.

1681
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:27,850
I think I would take on a kaiju as a pet.

1682
01:50:30,090 --> 01:50:31,490
Linear Lion Nobel.

1683
01:50:31,770 --> 01:50:32,450
Welcome back.

1684
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:33,170
Thank you.

1685
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:34,170
Thank you so much.

1686
01:50:34,790 --> 01:50:34,870
Oh.

1687
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:37,550
Oh.

1688
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:39,610
I just heard the cage.

1689
01:50:39,690 --> 01:50:40,190
A cage.

1690
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:41,050
I heard cage.

1691
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,650
I heard cage sound, no?

1692
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:49,850
I heard.

1693
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:52,750
I heard.

1694
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:04,220
But his breath is so stinky and nuclear.

1695
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:13,580
I think, like, one of my more fascinations, like, one of my
fascinations of Godzilla are, like, his evolutions.

1696
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:16,060
Like, the Shin Godzilla evolutions.

1697
01:51:17,240 --> 01:51:18,400
And when he's, like, mid-evolution.

1698
01:51:19,020 --> 01:51:23,740
and his eyes are, whoop, are like bulging out of his head,
you know?

1699
01:51:26,980 --> 01:51:28,100
So crazy.

1700
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,360
And like, his, his,

1701
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:38,490
hold on.

1702
01:51:39,010 --> 01:51:40,010
I'm like locked in.

1703
01:51:40,290 --> 01:51:40,490
Oh!

1704
01:51:40,750 --> 01:51:41,690
His old man again!

1705
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:42,190
Please don't!

1706
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:42,410
Ah!

1707
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:49,410
How is like, he's trying to do his nuclear breath.

1708
01:51:53,790 --> 01:52:03,910
Nuclear- nuclear beam What if instead Wait, this was not
here Is that like a copy of something?

1709
01:52:04,170 --> 01:52:11,950
Oh no, maybe it was Just kidding I thought it was like a
Freaky like you know Someone hacked my printer And started

1710
01:52:11,950 --> 01:52:22,430
printing out PPs Something Nuclear breath What if I didn't
have Minto Minto beam What if I had Nuclear Minto Beam.

1711
01:52:34,090 --> 01:52:35,730
Nuclear Minto Breath.

1712
01:52:37,670 --> 01:52:39,430
Well, so far we haven't been warned yet.

1713
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:42,110
Honestly, I feel like this...

1714
01:52:42,110 --> 01:52:43,070
Oh, he's angry!

1715
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:44,270
He's angry!

1716
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:48,110
I feel like this round has been kind of dead.

1717
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:55,810
I say, and then some guy is just gonna, like, pop up in my
face right now.

1718
01:52:56,050 --> 01:52:56,510
Right now.

1719
01:52:57,530 --> 01:52:58,230
Okay, good.

1720
01:52:58,430 --> 01:52:59,690
I'm glad it didn't happen, actually.

1721
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:03,030
Would it be flavored?

1722
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:05,470
Would it need a flavor?

1723
01:53:08,530 --> 01:53:10,010
It could be minty.

1724
01:53:10,390 --> 01:53:11,730
It could be like a mouthwash.

1725
01:53:12,270 --> 01:53:15,590
Sometimes that stuff feels like a nuclear blast to your
mouth.

1726
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:18,310
You know what I mean?

1727
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:19,830
Because it's like so...

1728
01:53:19,830 --> 01:53:20,970
You're like...

1729
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:22,470
You're like, this is just painful.

1730
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:25,230
Oh!

1731
01:53:27,110 --> 01:53:28,930
The dog is crying!

1732
01:53:29,530 --> 01:53:30,890
Oh, it also says it here!

1733
01:53:33,410 --> 01:53:43,650

Someone else translate it Or

1736
01:53:59,530 --> 01:54:01,370
It's very difficult, right?

1737
01:54:01,890 --> 01:54:02,670
I can't read it.

1738
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:07,410
It's a very difficult language.

1739
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:10,190
I don't know how to read the word.

1740
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:16,350
I don't know.

1741
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:19,640
Oh my god!

1742
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:20,800
Oh my god!

1743
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:22,720
Oh shoot, oh shoot, oh shoot!

1744
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:24,680
Wait, no, please, please, please, please, please, please,

1745
01:54:27,700 --> 01:54:28,300
Oh!

1746
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:30,980
Can I get a nuclear Minto beam?

1747
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:32,780
Nuclear Minto.

1748
01:54:43,330 --> 01:54:45,210
I'm not forgetting about you, lady.

1749
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:47,110
Don't you.

1750
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:49,490
Forget about her.

1751
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:52,430
I can't believe the dog actually changed.

1752
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:53,610
That's so funny.

1753
01:54:56,210 --> 01:54:59,090
Cat carrier door opened Cam 5.

1754
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:01,810
This thing?

1755
01:55:02,130 --> 01:55:03,210
Is it not supposed to be open?

1756
01:55:05,230 --> 01:55:05,850
Nope.

1757
01:55:06,150 --> 01:55:06,790
It's supposed to be open.

1758
01:55:14,350 --> 01:55:15,010
Hmm.

1759
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,080
Oh, it's scary.

1760
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:27,140
Oh, it's only there if it's not night vision.

1761
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:36,240
Is your memory gone?

1762
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,460
Are you feeling numb?

1763
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,660
Can I...

1764
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:39,600
Oh, that's an alligator!

1765
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:43,740
That's a straight up alligator.

1766
01:55:44,340 --> 01:55:45,280
Not even a crocodile.

1767
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,780
Last time we had an elephant.

1768
01:55:53,220 --> 01:55:54,340
Now we have an alligator.

1769
01:55:58,150 --> 01:55:59,630
Hey there, alligator.

1770
01:56:07,450 --> 01:56:07,890
Oh,

1771
01:56:13,130 --> 01:56:13,890
I just heard running.

1772
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:14,710
Oh my gosh.

1773
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:16,130
Who?

1774
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:17,110
Who is in here?

1775
01:56:17,190 --> 01:56:18,570
Who is running around?

1776
01:56:18,690 --> 01:56:19,970
No running in this establishment.

1777
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:26,380
No handcuffs this time.

1778
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:30,670
Oh, there he is.

1779
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:32,800
This guy again.

1780
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:41,660
Oh, there's so many jars.

1781
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:45,570
Oh, there's so many jars.

1782
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:48,630
Oh, I know.

1783
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:11,530
I'll be honest I have not looked in this area maybe even
once I've looked everywhere but there so I just looked at it

1784
01:57:11,530 --> 01:57:15,890
and I was like I just realized I don't know what anything
looks like in that area

1785
01:57:20,750 --> 01:57:21,190
Handcuffs?

1786
01:57:21,290 --> 01:57:22,290
Wait, are the handcuffs back?

1787
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:26,150
The handcuffs are not supposed to be there.

1788
01:57:34,670 --> 01:57:36,610
Yeah, we haven't gotten the warning yet.

1789
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:38,090
We're killing it, guys.

1790
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:38,770
We're killing it?

1791
01:57:39,290 --> 01:57:40,410
Yeah, no handcuffs.

1792
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,810
No handcuffs.

1793
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:47,730
Oh,

1794
01:57:51,160 --> 01:57:52,640
we only have 30 seconds left, though.

1795
01:57:53,160 --> 01:57:54,540
I think we got this, guys.

1796
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:56,400
Sad-eyed dog.

1797
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:58,580
I think we have it.

1798
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:00,060
Ah!

1799
01:58:00,660 --> 01:58:01,000
Zo!

1800
01:58:05,860 --> 01:58:07,420
Tattoos on the mannequin neck.

1801
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,760
I think that's not tattoos.

1802
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:12,880
I think it's like like the paint is chipping away.

1803
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:15,760
They've always been there though.

1804
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:17,580
Yo, yo, yo.

1805
01:58:21,110 --> 01:58:21,590
Oh.

1806
01:58:22,170 --> 01:58:22,430
Oh.

1807
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:23,850
Oh.

1808
01:58:30,750 --> 01:58:33,240
I think we've got this.

1809
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:42,270
We have 10 seconds?

1810
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:47,350
Anyone want to make a surprise visit in the last 10 seconds?

1811
01:58:48,390 --> 01:58:48,930
Nobody.

1812
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:51,170
Nobody.

1813
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:55,710
Wait, I think I just heard something.

1814
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:59,590
Anybody want to make an appearance?

1815
01:59:01,550 --> 01:59:02,170
Nobody.

1816
01:59:05,370 --> 01:59:07,210
Lights in the camp 3.

1817
01:59:09,650 --> 01:59:10,870
Oh my god.

1818
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:13,230
Oh come on, no!

1819
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:14,530
We don't have time for you!

1820
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:22,290
Successfully completed normal operations for all properties.

1821
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:24,110
No!

1822
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:25,490
I had you!

1823
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:26,870
Dang.

1824
01:59:27,890 --> 01:59:30,050
The operating room lamp changed.

1825
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:30,630
Oh, did it?

1826
01:59:30,810 --> 01:59:32,270
Oh, is that what the...

1827
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:33,530
the one in the...

1828
01:59:33,530 --> 01:59:34,310
Dang it!

1829
01:59:37,350 --> 01:59:39,730
Oh well, that's okay.

1830
01:59:41,070 --> 01:59:46,790
Oh, congratulations, you have now completed your regular
monitoring duties for all of the affected properties.

1831
01:59:47,330 --> 01:59:52,690
Check to see if there are any more anomalous phenomena that
have not yet been reported.

1832
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:57,130
Forgot to mention with everything going on, it was my
birthday a couple days ago!

1833
01:59:57,850 --> 02:00:00,370
Would you feel up to giving yourself a sincere compliment?

1834
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:04,110
Wait, giving me a compliment for your birthday.

1835
02:00:05,330 --> 02:00:06,530
Jolly ram rancher.

1836
02:00:07,350 --> 02:00:08,490
Happy birthday!

1837
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:10,590
Ah.

1838
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:14,190
Uh, compliment to me?

1839
02:00:15,490 --> 02:00:16,830
Uh.

1840
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:17,830
Yeah.

1841
02:00:18,630 --> 02:00:18,630
Oh.

1842
02:00:19,650 --> 02:00:19,950
Uh.

1843
02:00:24,350 --> 02:00:24,810
Uh.

1844
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:26,010
Uh.

1845
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:26,890
Uh.

1846
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:33,490
Uh.

1847
02:00:34,010 --> 02:00:34,090
Uh.

1848
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:35,930
Uh.

1849
02:00:40,300 --> 02:00:51,560
I could find anomalies well yeah I could see things mostly
good

1850
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:17,620
yeah maybe I see dead people and so do you apparently oh my
gosh wait anomalies reported 22 out of 61 in just the first

1851
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:28,720
area no way 22 out of 45 freaking man baby

1852
02:01:32,470 --> 02:01:36,420
there's so many 21 out of 55.

1853
02:01:38,020 --> 02:01:39,560
should we do round two for everything

1854
02:01:47,540 --> 02:01:49,520
Thanks, Raider, baby.

1855
02:01:51,480 --> 02:01:53,120
What's the special pay mode?

1856
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,840
There's even more anomalies!

1857
02:01:59,480 --> 02:02:00,580
Look, 81!

1858
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:04,920
No, stinking way.

1859
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:08,320
We can try it.

1860
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:11,240
Wait, what did it say special pay mode was?

1861
02:02:11,820 --> 02:02:13,500
Oh, oh, oh, good.

1862
02:02:16,540 --> 02:02:18,180
One is a million.

1863
02:02:19,420 --> 02:02:20,200
An 81.

1864
02:02:22,100 --> 02:02:23,040
Let's try it.

1865
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:23,900
Let's try it.

1866
02:02:24,020 --> 02:02:25,260
I believe we can do it.

1867
02:02:27,640 --> 02:02:27,960
Alright.

1868
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:32,460
It's been a while since we've seen this place, so let's go
back over it again.

1869
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:34,360
I have the bus coming.

1870
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:36,140
I wish you one day she'll see why.

1871
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:36,500
What?

1872
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:40,280
Thank you, Jolly, Ravanger.

1873
02:02:40,660 --> 02:02:44,040
I think Grandpa Baby wants a baby bottle of beer.

1874
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:46,260
Why is it right?

1875
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:47,300
But it's creepy.

1876
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:54,380
Okay, so we have 30 seconds, I think?

1877
02:02:54,920 --> 02:02:57,240
We only have three false reports this time.

1878
02:02:58,160 --> 02:03:00,340
Three false reports this time.

1879
02:03:01,240 --> 02:03:02,300
Instead of five.

1880
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,640
And apparently 81 anomalies that are possible, which is
crazy.

1881
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:09,480
Kenei!

1882
02:03:09,740 --> 02:03:10,940
Welcome back, thank you.

1883
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:17,440
Oh,

1884
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:23,010
no, never mind.

1885
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:23,890
It's already started.

1886
02:03:24,530 --> 02:03:24,530
Okay.

1887
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:27,550
We do not get a warning at all.

1888
02:03:27,710 --> 02:03:28,810
Or we don't get 30 seconds.

1889
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:30,250
They're like, you're in the game now.

1890
02:03:30,950 --> 02:03:32,390
Okay, this is it.

1891
02:03:33,050 --> 02:03:36,370
Oh, oh, all the chairs left and became a big old block.

1892
02:03:37,370 --> 02:03:40,610
Someone really... That seems like efficient cleaning up,
actually.

1893
02:03:42,690 --> 02:03:43,170
Okay.

1894
02:03:44,030 --> 02:03:46,070
Things are happening now, guys.

1895
02:03:46,550 --> 02:03:47,350
Oh my gosh, scary.

1896
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:48,130
Okay.

1897
02:03:48,550 --> 02:03:49,230
Keep your eyes.

1898
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:49,970
eyes peeled.

1899
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:54,410
I thought we would have the 30 seconds to look, but they're
like, no, this is expert mode.

1900
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:56,570
You don't need 30 seconds.

1901
02:03:59,650 --> 02:04:01,150
The chair cube!

1902
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:03,410
Uh-oh, someone then?

1903
02:04:04,010 --> 02:04:04,390
Woo!

1904
02:04:04,630 --> 02:04:05,630
What the heck is?

1905
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:06,930
Ew.

1906
02:04:10,070 --> 02:04:10,490
Ew!

1907
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:13,370
That has nice teeth, though.

1908
02:04:19,490 --> 02:04:27,730
we should oh we've gotten this one before i was literally
just about to say we shouldn't get repeats so much because

1909
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:38,330
there's 81 but maybe there's just that many more anomalies
that occur in that you know was that sound

1910
02:04:42,130 --> 02:04:43,730
was this always so long

1911
02:04:48,530 --> 02:04:52,150
The pot in the bathroom camera.

1912
02:04:53,210 --> 02:04:54,470
What about it?

1913
02:04:55,510 --> 02:04:57,030
We'll head back there.

1914
02:04:58,450 --> 02:04:59,790
Nope, that's always been like that.

1915
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:09,920
Oh!

1916
02:05:10,400 --> 02:05:11,220
Blood splatter.

1917
02:05:12,220 --> 02:05:13,840
Oh, and there's a face up here!

1918
02:05:13,980 --> 02:05:17,020
Oh my gosh, now each scene has multiple anomalies too.

1919
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:20,420
Okay, oh my goodness.

1920
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:22,420
The sign in camp 3.

1921
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:24,340
Let's see.

1922
02:05:24,960 --> 02:05:26,360
What did you guys see?

1923
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:27,460
Hold on.

1924
02:05:30,460 --> 02:05:31,760
Let me go, thank you!

1925
02:05:31,940 --> 02:05:32,460
This sign?

1926
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:36,540
Is there something weird with it?

1927
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:37,600
No?

1928
02:05:40,160 --> 02:05:40,640
No.

1929
02:05:41,620 --> 02:05:42,640
Don't think so.

1930
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,000
Ah, big toilet.

1931
02:05:45,160 --> 02:05:45,680
Big toilet.

1932
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:48,160
Wow, they're like going crazy active right now.

1933
02:05:53,620 --> 02:05:54,800
There's like everything.

1934
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:55,600
happening.

1935
02:06:00,410 --> 02:06:02,310
Okay, we haven't looked in this area in a bit.

1936
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:12,890
It's fall?

1937
02:06:14,510 --> 02:06:15,550
Man, toilet.

1938
02:06:18,730 --> 02:06:20,750
I heard the footsteps, though.

1939
02:06:23,190 --> 02:06:24,790
Someone is walking around.

1940
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:26,390
Someone is around.

1941
02:06:27,190 --> 02:06:29,270
I'm surprised we have not gotten anything in here.

1942
02:06:30,290 --> 02:06:31,450
Like, that's actually so surprising.

1943
02:06:31,470 --> 02:06:32,950
Oh my god!

1944
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:38,670
Season-changing ghost?

1945
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:41,670
Actually?

1946
02:06:43,470 --> 02:06:44,930
Are we gonna see this break?

1947
02:06:46,430 --> 02:06:47,770
My force!

1948
02:06:48,130 --> 02:06:48,510
Yeah!

1949
02:06:49,530 --> 02:06:49,730
Oh!

1950
02:06:50,810 --> 02:06:51,230
Ha!

1951
02:06:52,050 --> 02:06:54,030
Okay, I give up.

1952
02:06:55,810 --> 02:06:56,970
Um...

1953
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:57,770
Hmm.

1954
02:06:59,930 --> 02:07:01,090
Hmm.

1955
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:04,110
Hmm.

1956
02:07:04,590 --> 02:07:04,590
Oh!

1957
02:07:05,070 --> 02:07:05,070
Oh!

1958
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:06,870
Why do you look so worried?

1959
02:07:07,450 --> 02:07:08,450
I'm the one worried.

1960
02:07:09,150 --> 02:07:12,770
It's like when you look at a spider, the spider is scared of
you, but you're scared of the spider.

1961
02:07:15,330 --> 02:07:16,690
Like, you shouldn't be the one concerned.

1962
02:07:17,050 --> 02:07:17,790
I'm the one concerned.

1963
02:07:18,370 --> 02:07:19,310
I'm the one scared of you.

1964
02:07:25,610 --> 02:07:26,370
Minto Skywalker.

1965
02:07:29,970 --> 02:07:30,350
Yes.

1966
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:32,550
The force is in me.

1967
02:07:35,430 --> 02:07:36,070
with me.

1968
02:07:36,670 --> 02:07:40,590
May the force be with you and it's with me.

1969
02:07:47,350 --> 02:07:49,190
Oh, I thought this was swinging.

1970
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:51,170
Uh oh.

1971
02:07:51,850 --> 02:07:52,670
We got knocking.

1972
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:55,190
Who's knocking?

1973
02:07:56,250 --> 02:07:57,110
Where could you be?

1974
02:07:58,370 --> 02:07:59,450
Where are you at?

1975
02:08:00,350 --> 02:08:01,790
Oh my god, the graffiti!

1976
02:08:02,990 --> 02:08:04,810
Sick, sick, sick, sick.

1977
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:11,740
Someone was it knocking?

1978
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:16,520
Yeah, they put too many sixes.

1979
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,600
Come on, guys, come on.

1980
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:29,300
It's extra evil.

1981
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:33,040
Yeah, they really wanted to make sure that it was like...

1982
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:33,520
You know.

1983
02:08:34,380 --> 02:08:35,760
They were like, if 666...

1984
02:08:35,760 --> 02:08:36,860
Oh, there's a face on the roof.

1985
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:41,380
If 666 is evil, then it'll be extra evil if we add another
one.

1986
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:45,640
Was there a hole with the tables on cam 2?

1987
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:49,580
I think that's okay.

1988
02:08:53,220 --> 02:08:54,940
I think that one's okay.

1989
02:08:56,620 --> 02:08:57,080
Ha!

1990
02:09:03,630 --> 02:09:05,350
I give up.

1991
02:09:10,120 --> 02:09:15,180
Sure doesn't feel like we're getting 80 anomalies happening
now, does it?

1992
02:09:16,080 --> 02:09:17,680
Guy at the top of cam 5.

1993
02:09:20,060 --> 02:09:20,580
Guy?

1994
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:21,860
I don't think that's a guy.

1995
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:22,940
I think that's just the hole.

1996
02:09:24,620 --> 02:09:36,900
But I didn't notice this ladder that's freaky oh what a
thrill the lights on what a thrill like actually it's really

Yanny.

2008
02:10:56,250 --> 02:10:58,170
The roof is gone.

2009
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:08,080
Oh my gosh, right good catch good catch good catch

02:11:12,900 --> 02:11:31,600

the side eye Yeah?

2012
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:44,460
Really?

2013
02:11:49,280 --> 02:11:51,980
I know the time is going the same speed.

2014
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:02,160
Oh, someone is walking on glass.

2015
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:08,900
I know it's the same speed, but it just feels longer.

2016
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:11,500
I don't know what it is.

2017
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:13,100
Where are you?

2018
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:16,040
Where are you?

2019
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,140
around.

2020
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:21,860
I heard them.

2021
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:30,560
I don't think I've ever seen you doing something that's not
cute.

2022
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:34,960
How about when I'm being really spooky scary?

2023
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:37,300
That shouldn't be cute.

2024
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:39,700
That should be spooky scary, obviously.

2025
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:46,260
Okay, well, we haven't gotten yelled at.

2026
02:12:48,620 --> 02:12:49,200
Hmm.

2027
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,280
I'm still...

2028
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,100
Oh no, we're getting yelled at!

2029
02:12:59,660 --> 02:13:01,080
Oh, that's a slug.

2030
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:03,140
That's just a straight-up slug.

2031
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:04,860
I think we found the intruder.

2032
02:13:07,420 --> 02:13:08,620
Cam 7 is trash.

2033
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:10,720
The trash is...

2034
02:13:10,720 --> 02:13:11,620
is an anomaly!

2035
02:13:12,960 --> 02:13:14,400
The litter is an anomaly.

2036
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:16,180
Oh my gosh, the litter is an anomaly.

2037
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:20,560
Okay, I saw it and I thought so, but I was like, maybe I
just am misremembering.

2038
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:22,560
What the heck?

2039
02:13:27,090 --> 02:13:28,630
What the heck, a dial?

2040
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:33,110
We are smart.

2041
02:13:33,410 --> 02:13:34,150
Yeah, good catch.

2042
02:13:34,330 --> 02:13:34,830
Good catch.

2043
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,210
Oh, spooky.

2044
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:47,140
I don't like the two-parter.

2045
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:51,920
But they said Cam 7.

2046
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:55,800
Was that not the one that I did?

2047
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,520
This is a Cam 7.

2048
02:14:01,540 --> 02:14:03,220
You're reading Isle 2.

2049
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:06,940
It's not Cam 2.

2050
02:14:07,860 --> 02:14:08,580
It's Cam 7.

2051
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:17,220
Are the windows in Cam 6 always purple?

2052
02:14:24,540 --> 02:14:25,760
I don't like that.

2053
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,180
Uh, I don't know.

2054
02:14:28,460 --> 02:14:29,640
We gotta go find that noise.

2055
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,380
We're gonna get jump scared.

2056
02:14:33,180 --> 02:14:33,460
Oh!

2057
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:34,680
Hello.

2058
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:36,180
Hello.

2059
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:43,510
I wonder what's paranormal.

2060
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:45,870
Oh, we found this the creepy.

2061
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:51,710
Were you the one making that noise?

2062
02:14:56,690 --> 02:14:58,110
Okay, well, it stopped.

2063
02:15:00,050 --> 02:15:01,210
Was this always here?

2064
02:15:01,550 --> 02:15:02,090
This graffiti?

2065
02:15:03,410 --> 02:15:05,230
I'm going to report it.

2066
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,100
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2067
02:15:10,180 --> 02:15:10,820
I learned my lesson.

2068
02:15:12,600 --> 02:15:14,800
Oh, someone was eating here.

2069
02:15:15,100 --> 02:15:16,280
Someone was cooking here.

2070
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:18,380
Someone cooked here.

2071
02:15:22,420 --> 02:15:26,040
Why are we having a dinner at my...

2072
02:15:26,860 --> 02:15:28,080
at this place, huh?

2073
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:33,620
Someone cooked here.

2074
02:15:42,110 --> 02:15:43,730
What the heck?

2075
02:15:46,690 --> 02:15:51,290
Okay, I'll grab it before it disappears, but it was funny to
just watch it move.

2076
02:16:06,270 --> 02:16:15,690
I'm angry why doesn't it work why doesn't it work one of
these days it'll work

2077
02:16:19,030 --> 02:16:27,170
all these places look like a perfect place for one of
walter's labs oh that's that's just an eyeball there's not

2078
02:16:27,170 --> 02:16:39,510
even a face in the darkness it's just an eyeball um i think
these places are too dark you know too contaminated maybe

2079
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:42,690

2080
02:16:47,320 --> 02:16:50,060

2082
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:23,440
get your eyes checked.

2083
02:17:25,520 --> 02:17:27,820
Okay, we have multiple anomalies, though.

2084
02:17:29,020 --> 02:17:30,200
Like this, breaking!

2085
02:17:30,740 --> 02:17:30,980
Cha!

2086
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:35,260
Oh!

2087
02:17:35,480 --> 02:17:36,220
There's a...

2088
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:37,380
Oh my gosh, severed head.

2089
02:17:39,100 --> 02:17:40,260
I get it, I get it.

2090
02:17:40,460 --> 02:17:41,520
Multiple anomaly.

2091
02:17:42,760 --> 02:17:43,320
We just...

2092
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,020
Something just broke.

2093
02:17:44,760 --> 02:17:45,260
The toilet!

2094
02:17:45,460 --> 02:17:46,860
Wait, there's another head up here!

2095
02:17:47,120 --> 02:17:48,140
Oh my god.

2096
02:17:50,580 --> 02:17:53,840
Oh my god, oh my god!

2097
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:59,680
That one was really tough to see.

2098
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:07,400
It was like right below you guys.

2099
02:18:09,260 --> 02:18:09,780
Eee!

2100
02:18:10,740 --> 02:18:11,300
No!

2101
02:18:11,580 --> 02:18:16,990
Why wouldn't it- Okay.

2102
02:18:21,850 --> 02:18:23,530
I think we might be able to do this, guys.

2103
02:18:26,950 --> 02:18:31,370
We did see a lot more of the anomalies.

2104
02:18:35,230 --> 02:18:36,930
The fine China!

2105
02:18:40,130 --> 02:18:41,270
That's freaky.

2106
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:42,570
That one's cool.

2107
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:46,170
Alright, we have one... Oh!

2108
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:47,050
No!

2109
02:18:48,610 --> 02:18:50,650
What do you mean I missed one anomaly?

2110
02:18:50,770 --> 02:18:52,070
I just got there.

2111
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,640
This job really makes you lose your head.

2112
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:02,100
This job makes me lose my mind.

2113
02:19:05,180 --> 02:19:05,800
Up in here?

2114
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:06,980
Up in here.

2115
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:09,400

Dang it.

2121
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:28,870
I feel like, though, I didn't miss that one.

2122
02:19:28,990 --> 02:19:30,590
I just didn't have time to report it.

2123
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:31,810
We were right there.

2124
02:19:32,390 --> 02:19:33,530

It doesn't have like a fish in it.

2145
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:39,650
But what it does have.

2146
02:20:41,070 --> 02:20:41,350
This.

2147
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:44,970
It has like the edamame and stuff.

2148
02:20:46,410 --> 02:20:48,330
And some seaweed.

2149
02:20:49,390 --> 02:20:51,570
And it doesn't use like white rice.

2150
02:20:52,330 --> 02:20:53,690
So it's like a little healthier.

2151
02:20:55,190 --> 02:20:56,310
Oh my god this one though.

2152
02:20:57,030 --> 02:20:57,970
It's so.

2153
02:20:58,990 --> 02:21:00,930
It's so good.

2154
02:21:01,110 --> 02:21:03,110
It's so good.

2155
02:21:04,510 --> 02:21:13,430
there's no like filling inside like you know like a normal
one but this it's like it's so so yummy

2156
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:26,130
it's not too dry no i'm never not that i think at least at
this one though it's so yummy oh yeah it says right there

2157
02:21:26,130 --> 02:21:30,710
rice with barley and amame and salted kelp yeah this is my

2158
02:21:33,970 --> 02:21:35,370
It's super duper yummy.

2159
02:21:37,030 --> 02:21:38,290
It's so yummy.

2160
02:21:39,270 --> 02:21:42,010
So every time I go to Lawson, I get that one.

2161
02:21:44,270 --> 02:21:46,790
And if they don't have it, I go to another Lawson.

2162
02:21:50,190 --> 02:21:50,670
Yummy.

2163
02:21:51,850 --> 02:21:53,750
But yeah, I do like a Tuna Mayo.

2164
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:55,850
And sometimes they make ones that are...

2165
02:21:55,850 --> 02:21:57,570
It depends on the convenience.

2166
02:21:57,750 --> 02:21:59,830
But sometimes they make ones that are...

2167
02:22:00,430 --> 02:22:02,150
That are like...

2168
02:22:02,150 --> 02:22:02,850
How do you say?

2169
02:22:05,830 --> 02:22:06,270
Oh,

2170
02:22:09,860 --> 02:22:10,700
like an omu rice.

2171
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:22,060
Yeah, they're like an omu rice, so they'll be wrapped in
egg, and then the filling on the inside is ketchup.

2172
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:27,680
Friend of mine made a salmon and chili jam onigiri.

2173
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:29,240
I think about it every day.

2174
02:22:29,640 --> 02:22:31,140
Wait, that sounds so good.

2175
02:22:31,620 --> 02:22:32,880
Wait, but would I be able to have it?

2176
02:22:32,980 --> 02:22:34,020
It's kind of sound spicy.

2177
02:22:36,960 --> 02:22:38,740
Yeah, it is.

2178
02:22:38,900 --> 02:22:39,580
It's yummy, yummy.

2179
02:22:41,940 --> 02:22:47,220
I was excited to see a Lawson's in Hawaii, but there was
nothing Lawson's about it.

2180
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:51,040
Why?

2181
02:22:52,920 --> 02:23:00,820
Is it similar to like how the American 7-Eleven has like,
has very different menu as well, maybe?

2182
02:23:03,380 --> 02:23:06,240
I think some of the food I eat may actually kill you.

2183
02:23:06,240 --> 02:23:13,380
well a good thing i'm actually dead it might send me though
somewhere not somewhere beyond i what's beyond the afterlife

2184
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:27,420
i wonder it might make me reincarnate it might like shoot me
into a new life what if it like forces me to reincarnate as

2185
02:23:27,420 --> 02:23:35,940
like an aunt don't do that to me the bathroom the back rooms
or the bathrooms

2186
02:23:38,960 --> 02:23:51,400
to me 7-11 we have in Hawaii is pretty solid especially for
US store oh I do know that like that you know obviously

2187
02:23:51,400 --> 02:24:01,280
there's a lot of like Japanese tourists that go to Hawaii
because it's like it's like even more exotic Okinawa they're

2188
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:06,660
like yeah I've been to the United States oh yeah on the
mainland no I went to Hawaii

2189
02:24:10,120 --> 02:24:21,220
but I mean I don't blame them either I still want to try
going to Okinawa though I want to go I want to go should we

2190
02:24:24,420 --> 02:24:35,440

02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,780
It's only 55.

2193
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:43,460
I feel like we could maybe get all of them.

2194
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:43,860
Maybe.

2195
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:48,200
What?

2196
02:24:48,340 --> 02:24:50,440
It takes about like 20 minutes to play, you know?

2197
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:54,500
So then I could have an hour to rest.

2198
02:24:54,860 --> 02:24:54,880

2199
02:25:02,990 --> 02:25:04,430
