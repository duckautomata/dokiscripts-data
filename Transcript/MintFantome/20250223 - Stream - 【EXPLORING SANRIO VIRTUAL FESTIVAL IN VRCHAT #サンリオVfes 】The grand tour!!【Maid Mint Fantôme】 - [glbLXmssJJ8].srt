00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,640
Hello!

3
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,720
Everybody, uh, uh...

4
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,160
Hello.

5
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,800
Welcome to VRChat!

6
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,540
Hello everybody!

7
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,820
Hello, hello, hello!

8
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,660
I kinda have to talk a little bit fast because we got a show to check out!

9
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,420
If you can see behind me, Sunreal Virtual Festival 2025!

10
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,780
Hello!

11
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,620
Sorry, my chat is, uh, you guys are behind me today.

12
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,960
So, um, uh, oh gosh.

13
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,720
Am I falling through the world?

14
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,500
What's going on?

15
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:23,920
I don't know.

16
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,240
Ignore any scuff.

17
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,380
What did I just do with my window?

18
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,940
Oh my gosh.

19
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,420
Where did you guys go?

20
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,580
Oh, there you are.

21
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay, can you guys hear me?

22
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,400
Can you guys hear me?

23
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,240
Okay, can you guys hear me?

24
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,960
Oh wait, hold on.

25
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
Can you guys hear me okay?

26
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,460
Can you guys see me?

27
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,700
I'm gonna see.

28
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,560
Yeah?

29
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:51,940
Yeah?

30
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,480
Yeah?

31
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,180
Okay!

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
Okay, okay, okay.

33
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
So like I said, we got a show to catch.

34
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,080
And I got a lot of things to show you guys.

35
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,620
So, um, first of all, I would like to say thank you Sunreal for sponsoring this stream!

36
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,180
And, uh, Sunreal Virtual Festival 2025!

37
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,200
So, we're gonna go check it out.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,140
Like I said, we got a show to catch first because, um, there's a lot going on in here!

39
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,760
So, I'm gonna, like, take you there.

40
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,520
And then we're gonna run, run, run past some cool stuff.

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,860
But I'll show you in a bit.

42
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,500
It's a sneak preview.

43
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,060
And then we're gonna go watch a show.

44
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,980
And then we're gonna walk around and pretend, you know, I've been to real Puroland only once before.

45
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,020
But, it's very, very cute.

46
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:45,560
And I can promise you that if you think virtual Puroland is cute, you'll really want to, uh, explore real Puroland too.

47
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,580
Because, um, because virtual Puroland is actually based off of real Puroland.

48
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,380
So, um, it's very exciting.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,880
Uh, I just want to say also that, uh, Sunreal Virtual Festival is happening now!

50
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,860
Actually, uh, it's from February 9th to March 9th.

51
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,000
So, uh, we still have a little bit of time.

52
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:12,240
And you have time to visit virtual Puroland and check out the shows that they got going on.

53
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,020
Um, you can, uh, explore the festival here in VRChat as we are doing today.

54
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,940
Um, they also have things on Spawn, which, you know, is that streaming site you might have used before to watch other shows.

55
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,180
And also a place called MetaMe, which I will explain more about that later.

56
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,720
And they also got some free content on YouTube and reality as well.

57
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,780
So, there's lots of stuff going on.

58
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,820
It's a big ol' party.

59
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,840
Are you guys ready?

60
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,000
Are you guys ready?

61
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,240
Never heard of it?

62
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,260
S-P-W-N.

63
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,080
Spawn.

64
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,220
Yep, that's it.

65
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,560
You guys ready?

66
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,200
Yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:02,660
Oh my gosh, are you guys ready for our date in virtual Puroland?

68
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:03,780
Oh my god.

69
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,260
I'm a big fan of Sanrio.

70
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,820
Um, my credentials.

71
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,740
Um, okay.

72
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,060
Let me say my credentials are that I love Cinnamoroll.

73
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,480
Very, very, very much.

74
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:24,680
Um, you can't see my toes right now, but I'm actually wearing Cinnamoroll, uh, slippers.

75
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,300
At this very moment.

76
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:33,620
And I own at least, um, five pairs, five different pairs of Cinnamoroll socks.

77
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,760
And I have Cinnamoroll clothes, and Cinnamoroll underwear, and Cinnamoroll plushies.

78
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,920
And my desk mat is Cinnamoroll.

79
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,640
And I have Cinnamoroll ears.

80
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,020
And I, and he's not a dog, he's, I mean, sorry, wait, he's not a bunny, he's a dog.

81
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,440
Oh gosh, I almost mixed it up.

82
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,220
Wait, what time is it?

83
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,840
We got five minutes.

84
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,960
Oh my god, five minutes until the show.

85
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,280
Wait, where are you guys going?

86
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,480
Why is my chat disappearing?

87
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,360
Hold on.

88
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,260
Everything's weird right now.

89
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,840
Hold on, I'm gonna, I'm gonna pop you guys out so I can read you.

90
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:09,820
Not on.

91
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,860
Not on.

92
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,160
There we go.

93
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,940
There we go.

94
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,300
I have you guys in here now.

95
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,060
I have you guys here now.

96
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,020
I don't want you guys not on...

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,920
My computer.

98
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,760
Okay.

99
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,300
Yeah.

100
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,700
That's me.

101
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,380
That's you!

102
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,240
So close.

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I'm getting closer.

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,540
Oh yeah!

105
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,260
And also, I wanted to say...

106
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,040
So, a little bit of...

107
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,220
A little bit of...

108
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,820
What's the word?

109
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,040
Some details about Sanrio Virtual Festival.

110
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,300
The virtual event is set in a massive virtual space modeled after...

111
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,140
Featuring artists, creators, Sanrio characters.

112
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,720
Everybody.

113
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:12,840
Sanrio fans can all enjoy and all have a good time.

114
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,420
What the heck?

115
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,480
Where did my notes go?

116
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,460
Why is everything so cursed today?

117
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,840
Sorry guys, hold on.

118
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,340
Hey boo.

119
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,120
There we go.

120
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:24,640
There we go.

121
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:24,940
Anyway.

122
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,900
So, you can go, you can interact.

123
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,280
Of course, there's gonna be other people.

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,660
You can also have some...

125
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,820
You can also meet some of the other Sanrio characters.

126
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,500
And, you know, just have a good, immersive, fun time in Virtual Puroland.

127
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,000
And...

128
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,040
Yeah!

129
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,680
Let's go check it out.

130
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,880
One moment, please.

131
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,340
I'm actually going to try and do something.

132
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,000
There we go.

133
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,520
One moment.

134
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,540
I actually want to see if we can get into our own private space real quick.

135
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,360
If not, just ignore the other people.

136
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,700
Ignore the people in the world.

137
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,120
You know what?

138
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,900
Let's just go.

139
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,360
We'll see whatever...

140
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,460
Let's see who else is around.

141
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,000
You know?

142
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,080
It's a surprise.

143
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,120
We'll see.

144
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,100
Yeah, ignore the people.

145
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll turn them down.

146
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,100
We won't be able to hear them.

147
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,560
We won't listen to them.

148
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,520
Okay.

149
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,440
Let's go!

150
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,400
As you can see...

151
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,820
As you can see, too...

152
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,420
You can enter right through the main...

153
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,720
The main VR chat portal.

154
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,580
So...

155
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,480
Very, very cool.

156
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,660
It's loading.

157
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
You guys see a black screen?

158
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,780
Okay.

159
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Let me make sure all my audio is good.

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Being in VR is hard, but it makes it so much more worth it.

161
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,580
You guys hear anything?

162
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,540
Can you guys hear anything?

163
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,300
Turning off my mic.

164
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
Nobody can hear me.

165
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,500
I'm scared.

166
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,660
You see Kaiju in the background?

167
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,720
There's gonna be like all sorts of people.

168
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,680
We can hear music?

169
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,160
You can?

170
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,700
Okay, good, good, good.

171
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,580
Good, good, good.

172
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,900
I don't know where my audio went, but...

173
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,380
You hear music?

174
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,160
Okay, good, good, good.

175
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,400
Okay, alright.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,440
Sorry, I'm not gonna be talking for a bit.

177
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,880
I'm gonna look really awkward.

178
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,700
People are gonna see me and be like...

179
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,040
What is she doing?

180
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,160
So weird.

181
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,220
Alright.

182
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Alright, let's go to the show.

183
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,560
But I can't show you this yet, yet, yet.

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,600
We gotta go to the show.

185
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,300
We gotta go to the show.

186
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,960
What is going on?

187
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,600
You can't...

188
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,060
Spoilers.

189
00:10:59,320 --> 00:10:59,640
Spoilers.

190
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,280
Spoilers.

191
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,240
We're coming back.

192
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,580
We're coming back here.

193
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,380
Spoilers.

194
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:04,960
Spoilers.

195
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,600
Spoilers.

196
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,460
Spoilers.

197
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:06,980
Spoilers.

198
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,900
Running, running, running to the show.

199
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,320
Or we're gonna be late.

200
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,300
No, we're not gonna be late.

201
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,620
We're gonna make it to the show.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,580
I'm going down the stairs.

203
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,240
We're going to the show.

204
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
Alright, guys.

205
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,800
Let's go watch...

206
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,620
Dream in a Dream.

207
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Yeah, don't look.

208
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:33,900
Don't look yet.

209
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,020
Don't look, don't look yet.

210
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,680
It's all...

211
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,620
It's all spoilers.

212
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,700
Wait.

213
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I think the show is starting.

214
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,660
You guys...

215
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,500
Let me...

216
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,180
Let me set you up.

217
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,020
Hold on.

218
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,540
It's looking at me.

219
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,760
So cute.

220
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,100
Wait, hold on.

221
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,740
Let me...

222
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,440
Where did you guys go?

223
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,860
There you are.

224
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,700
Let me adjust a bit.

225
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,960
Let's move it like right here.

226
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,520
Okay.

227
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,280
Give me one second.

228
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,580
As long as you guys can hear, it's okay.

229
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,120
I currently can't hear.

230
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,720
So I'm gonna be adjusting a few things.

231
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,180
We can hear?

232
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,220
Okay, good, good, good.

233
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,940
That's more important for you guys to hear.

234
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,260
But I will soon hear.

235
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,260
I'm working on it.

236
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,380
VRChat has been giving...

237
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,360
Oh my god!

238
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:50,990
Oh my god.

239
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,470
Wait, this looks exactly...

240
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:53,930
Oh my gosh.

241
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,190
Exactly like where they have the parade and everything.

242
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:56,890
Hold on.

243
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,810
I'm gonna...

244
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,330
I don't wanna...

245
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,470
I don't wanna be in your shot, but...

246
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,990
Where are you guys?

247
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,410
Oh, there you are.

248
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,350
I don't wanna be in your shot.

249
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,070
I don't wanna be blocking anybody else either.

250
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,470
Shit, I'm bright.

251
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,130
I'm so bright.

252
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:19,270
I'm shining.

253
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:22,950
I'm gonna move.

254
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,530
I'm gonna move.

255
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,210
Hold on, I'm trying to fix my audio.

256
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Turn your phone by this time.

257
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,060
Look how cute he is!

258
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,900
Like a ghost.

259
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,840
One moment, everybody.

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,200
As long as you're watching.

261
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,240
Watch, watch, watch.

262
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,240
Get out of the way.

263
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,160
It's so pretty.

264
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:19,780
Oh my gosh.

265
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,460
It seriously looks exactly how it does in real Puroland.

266
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,220
And it's really fun because they do parades here and they do shows here.

267
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,960
Oh my gosh!

268
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,660
Wait!

269
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,960
Wait, where are you guys?

270
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,140
Come back, camera!

271
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,980
Oh my gosh!

272
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,640
Here, I'll let you guys do it like this.

273
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,960
Oh, we're back.

274
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:48,440
Kitty!

275
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:52,800
Kitty!

276
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,980
Where did you guys go?

277
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,160
Oh, there you are.

278
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,700
Oh, look how cute she is!

279
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,380
Oh,

280
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,240
she went to the bathroom!

281
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,300
Oh my gosh.

282
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,340
Magical door?

283
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,760
Is the audio okay by the way?

284
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,540
Please let me know.

285
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,940
Yeah, it's good?

286
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,680
Okay, good, good.

287
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,540
I'm gonna do something real quick.

288
00:15:59,540 --> 00:15:59,820
Okay.

289
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:08,280
Let me know if it does.

290
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
If you hear a double.

291
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,000
Wait!

292
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,440
Can you guys see?

293
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,700
Wait, I'm gonna redo the camera.

294
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,300
Hold on.

295
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,400
Where are you guys?

296
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,680
I can't see.

297
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,340
Oh no!

298
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,460
Wait, I'm gonna send you guys to my view.

299
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,100
Can you guys see?

300
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,940
Oh my god!

301
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,620
No!

302
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,300
Where are you guys?

303
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,480
This is all over the place!

304
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,720
This is craziness!

305
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,060
I think you guys are down here.

306
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:55,940
I got you.

307
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,780
I got you.

308
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,080
All

309
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,430
over the place!

310
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,410
This is...

311
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,430
This is truly something I feel you must experience.

312
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,800
Here, I'll go on this side.

313
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,780
We can be watching together, okay guys?

314
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,880
I said I won!

315
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,720
Oh my gosh!

316
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,380
Daniel!

317
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,100
Pompompurin!

318
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,880
Come on!

319
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,800
So cute!

320
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,600
It's so cute!

321
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,240
Look at them go!

322
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,540
Everything is so beautiful!

323
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,040
I wanna just run up to them and...

324
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:54,720
You know?

325
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,040
I just wanna hug them tightly.

326
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,510
It's cool, isn't it?

327
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
No, I'm not sponsored.

328
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,600
I'm good today.

329
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,140
I'm good.

330
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm good.

331
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,960
I'm not in a sponsored stream.

332
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,260
I'm being on my best behavior.

333
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,690
Cinnamoroll!

334
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,170
Cinnamoroll!

335
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,990
They're floating!

336
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,610
We're floating!

337
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,050
Wait, can we go to Cinnamoroll's side?

338
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:49,830
You guys?

339
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,140
There you guys go.

340
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,340
Look out!

341
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,560
Oh my gosh!

342
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,060
Just a little guy!

343
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,300
Wow!

344
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Can I show you guys real quick the area too?

345
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,780
Look at the world.

346
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,580
Oh, hi Robert.

347
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,280
Bye!

348
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:32,630
Oh my gosh!

349
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:34,710
Daniel!

350
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,250
Daniel!

351
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,890
It's

352
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,790
so cute!

353
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,580
Cute!

354
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,480
Oh my gosh, the pen light on her thing is so fun.

355
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,960
Pompompurin!

356
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,300
Pompompurin.

357
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,920
That's one of Matara's favorites.

358
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,100
She likes Pompompurin and...

359
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,300
I can't remember their names.

360
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,030
Oh no, look at their faces!

361
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:38,930
They're too cute!

362
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,030
Even Kuromi!

363
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,290
So cute.

364
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:45,750
So cute.

365
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,110
So cute.

366
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:46,470
So cute.

367
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,130
So cute.

368
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,570
So cute.

369
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,330
So cute.

370
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,320
The one that looks like Fishman.

371
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,560
I don't know why I can't remember his name all of a sudden.

372
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,040
Oh my gosh.

373
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,220
Oh gosh.

374
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,360
In VR guys, this is kind of intense.

375
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,260
Wait, they're flying above me!

376
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,360
What's happening?

377
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,300
They're all...

378
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,860
They're flying!

379
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:53,760
Oh no.

380
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,280
Oh no.

381
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,420
Guys,

382
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,130
I apologize so much again also.

383
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:20,370
I currently don't have audio, so I wish I could try to translate some of the Japanese for you guys, but...

384
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,210
I'm currently just going off of vibes.

385
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,190
Because something's up with my headset, but the show goes on.

386
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,390
And I'm really enjoying myself regardless.

387
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:30,070
So hopefully you guys are hearing all the audio.

388
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,650
It's very cute and fun.

389
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,430
You hearing it is more important than me.

390
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,090
Flabs are good.

391
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:38,930
Flabs are good.

392
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,590
Look how cute he is!

393
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,610
Pompompurin.

394
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,120
Oh my gosh!

395
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,560
This looks so awesome!

396
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,560
Oh my gosh, it's giving like Madomagi vibes.

397
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,960
It's so cool!

398
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,640
I'll show you guys a little bit of the whole setting.

399
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,560
Look how cool this is.

400
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,280
Oh!

401
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,020
Cinnamon!

402
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,000
Kuromi!

403
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,560
Kuromi.

404
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,480
He's 2D.

405
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,620
They're 2D.

406
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,220
They're just like me.

407
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,520
Well, I'm 3D right now.

408
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:03,820
Oh my gosh!

409
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,580
They're on a stage!

410
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,860
Oh my god.

411
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,320
Oh, this place!

412
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,100
Guys,

413
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,980
I 100%...

414
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,080
If you have a VR headset...

415
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,080
Experience this in VR.

416
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,440
How is this free?

417
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,420
It's so cool.

418
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,360
Be careful, Pudding!

419
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,540
No!

420
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:09,360
No!

421
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,320
No, Pudding!

422
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,180
Get up!

423
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,620
You can do it!

424
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,280
Look at Cinnamon.

425
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:39,980
Look at his face.

426
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,780
Hey, Cinnamon!

427
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,500
Final boss time.

428
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,310
No, they look so sad!

429
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,470
No, they look so sad!

430
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,230
Oh, someone's translating in the chat.

431
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,910
Thank you so much.

432
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,070
Sick tunes.

433
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:20,350
I believe it.

434
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:21,870
I'm gonna have to watch it again later.

435
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,690
I'm gonna come back.

436
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,530
There's actually several shows throughout the day.

437
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,270
You can come and see.

438
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,000
Kiwi looks so determined.

439
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,160
You got this!

440
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,480
You got this!

441
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,700
The design is so cool, yeah.

442
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,220
I'm so boring.

443
00:27:59,560 --> 00:27:59,800
No!

444
00:27:59,800 --> 00:27:59,960
No!

445
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,100
Oh no!

446
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,660
All the negative comments!

447
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,000
All the negative comments!

448
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,080
They're flying around us!

449
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,180
He's like, right above me.

450
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,640
Don't let the negative comments get to you!

451
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,060
No...

452
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,720
Pudding!

453
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,540
Oh, the mic.

454
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,340
The mic!

455
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,300
She's over here now.

456
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,640
Oh my god!

457
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,380
He's sucking them up!

458
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,180
No!

459
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,620
Look at Kitty Jenkins!

460
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,300
Hold on.

461
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,100
Oh my goodness.

462
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,040
You guys can't see.

463
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,120
I think she just saved them.

464
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,640
She just stopped them with love.

465
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,420
There you go.

466
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,620
They're all floating.

467
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,580
Get you guys in close to the action.

468
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,100
Cute!

469
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,400
Oh my gosh, the visual effects go hard.

470
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,000
They go so crazy!

471
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,460
It feels like I'm watching a music video.

472
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,120
What the heck?

473
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,080
Oh my god!

474
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,840
The stage is even down there.

475
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,560
You can see it.

476
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,660
This is going so hard.

477
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,340
Something broke up there.

478
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,940
Wait, the parrot's back!

479
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,860
Did they say to send your energy?

480
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
That's so cute!

481
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,660
Look at everybody's...

482
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,080
Everybody's sending the energy!

483
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,180
That's so cute!

484
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,120
Look at them go!

485
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,560
Cute!

486
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,800
Send your dreams!

487
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,190
Thank you!

488
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,310
I think someone's

489
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:05,950
trying to give me a pen light.

490
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,870
Thank you!

491
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,130
There we go, I got one too!

492
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,630
I don't know how to use this.

493
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,070
Yay!

494
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,650
Sorry, I didn't realize I was sending so many.

495
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,330
Aww, they are getting along.

496
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,360
In front of Pompompurin's body.

497
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,920
Awaken Pompompurin!

498
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,910
Oh, sorry.

499
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,650
He's back!

500
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,230
I'm shocked.

501
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,370
They are so cute!

502
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,190
The world is so cute, this one too.

503
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,450
The little jellyfish in the air.

504
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,370
So cute!

505
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,430
So cute!

506
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,440
Kitty...

507
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,540
Thank you for letting me realize my dream.

508
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,060
I'm glad.

509
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,780
Remember this wonderful dream.

510
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,060
The world is so small!

511
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,140
Look how small he is!

512
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,320
Look how small he is!

513
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:38,440
Everybody else is so tiny!

514
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,160
So tiny...

515
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,260
Look at him.

516
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,160
Oh, he's on his shield.

517
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,380
He's just a little guy.

518
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,920
I want to go squeeze him.

519
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,760
Oh, the bird!

520
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,630
Get in the ground where you belong!

521
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:50,970
So, so cute.

522
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,830
Pompompurin's little butt.

523
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:54,290
See it?

524
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:57,550
Cinema!

525
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,390
Cinema!

526
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,030
Cinema!

527
00:36:59,230 --> 00:36:59,350
Cinema!

528
00:36:59,530 --> 00:36:59,690
Cinema!

529
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,950
Cinema!

530
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,580
I don't know if you noticed the person over there too.

531
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,240
On the other side of the map.

532
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,460
You can see the whole...

533
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,280
You can see the show from wherever you want to stand.

534
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,680
Definitely come check it out, you know?

535
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,640
The tree!

536
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,060
The tree is coming back!

537
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,900
Oh my god!

538
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,820
Oh my god!

539
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,360
What is the guy kitty's name?

540
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,300
His name is Daniel.

541
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,360
He's kitty's boyfriend.

542
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:56,510
It's manifesting.

543
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,130
I feel like I've

544
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,230
had a lot of wonderful dreams.

545
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:31,070
Meow!

546
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,350
It's so cute!

547
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,730
But why?

548
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,850
Why?

549
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:55,630
I'm going to make apple pie, so everyone come!

550
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,150
You can see her bathroom over there.

551
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,670
Bedroom over there.

552
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,710
That is too cute.

553
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,310
I want to know what the other shows are like now.

554
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,950
And this show actually has no subtitles.

555
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,430
As you can tell, it's in Nihongo, but no subtitles.

556
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:19,070
But there are other shows that do have English subtitles.

557
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:25,890
The visuals alone are very very cool.

558
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:29,170
But there are also some shows with English subtitles.

559
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,890
I'm sorry, I wish I could translate for you guys.

560
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,870
I still can't hear it.

561
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,330
Can you understand what they're saying?

562
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,530
Maybe if I could hear the show, but I've been in silence this entire time.

563
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,170
You get the gist?

564
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,630
Good good.

565
00:39:54,630 --> 00:40:01,290
Luckily, Sanrio is for children, so it's not too difficult, right?

566
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:05,670
It's easy Japanese.

567
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,710
Wait, are we taking a picture?

568
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,230
I want

569
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,960
to be in the picture.

570
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,140
Come on, Daniel.

571
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,540
Oh.

572
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,980
Just kidding.

573
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,120
He absorbed it.

574
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,660
Here, let's go.

575
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,840
Let's go over here, you guys.

576
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,340
Let's talk over here.

577
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,660
Wait, can I?

578
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:14,680
Maybe not.

579
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,540
Here, we'll talk right here.

580
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,460
Oh gosh.

581
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,180
Like, right here.

582
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,420
Wait, hold on.

583
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,320
Oh gosh, you guys are all the way up there.

584
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,220
Can I grab?

585
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,120
How do I let go?

586
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,860
One moment, sorry.

587
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,300
Sorry, don't get dizzy.

588
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,240
Don't get dizzy on me.

589
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,880
Yay, I have people.

590
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,520
Hello!

591
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,560
I have people trying to talk to me, but I have no voices on.

592
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:55,600
Yay!

593
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,220
Did you guys like the show?

594
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,960
Sorry, I have no mouth moving.

595
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,360
Maybe I can change into my other avatar then.

596
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,740
If I'm not going to have my mouth moving anyway.

597
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,660
Give me a second.

598
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,380
We change.

599
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:11,680
What just happened?

600
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:13,600
Hold on.

601
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,360
One moment.

602
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,000
Let's just become bigger.

603
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:22,960
Become bigger.

604
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,080
There we go.

605
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,100
Yay!

606
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,040
That was so cute!

607
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,360
Oh my gosh, that show was so crazy though, because...

608
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,040
Oh my gosh, hello!

609
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,300
As you can see, you can come into the world and there will be lots of other people you can meet.

610
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,360
So, you know, even if you're just like, I don't have anyone who plays VRChat or anything.

611
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,540
You can always come and you can always, you know, maybe make a Wisp hangout to come and see some of the other shows.

612
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,500
At the... at the... at the Virtual Player Land, you know?

613
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,180
But that's not the only thing I wanted to show you guys today.

614
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,020
There's other stuff.

615
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,940
If you thought that was it, no, no, no.

616
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,740
There's more to see.

617
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:14,200
Yo, yo, yo.

618
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,560
Yo, yo, yo.

619
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:16,640
And...

620
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,660
So, before we go on to the next thing, I want to...

621
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:30,100
I want to go back to the beginning, because I said, remember, there was like some stuff that I said spoilers, spoilers, spoilers about.

622
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,460
So let's go to... yeah.

623
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:33,960
Okay, hold on.

624
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,000
Let's... I think if I press respawn, it'll work.

625
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,320
Let's try it out.

626
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,560
Respawn!

627
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,120
Wait!

628
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,600
You guys are all the way over there!

629
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:48,520
Wait!

630
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,260
Wait!

631
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,060
Give me a second.

632
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,740
Actually, let me try doing this.

633
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,600
You guys see a black screen right now?

634
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,120
You guys see anything right now?

635
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
What do you see right now?

636
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,120
You guys have created...

637
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,640
Oh, sorry, hold on.

638
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,600
One moment, please.

639
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:29,280
I have created a very own world!

640
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,600
So we are now...

641
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,840
I wanted to show off how, you know, you could hang out with other people.

642
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,520
And it was kind of fun.

643
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,980
It was really fun seeing everybody cheer on during the show, right?

644
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,020
So, kind of glad that we got that experience.

645
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:43,020
But welcome to the main entrance of Sanrio Borderland!

646
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,880
Which, this is kind of insane, because it looks the exact same!

647
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,140
It looks the exact same of how it is in the actual, real Borderland.

648
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,940
Yeah, the pen light was so cool, right?

649
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,100
And it was so nice that someone gave me one.

650
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,920
But, let's do a couple of fun things that are on the main strip here.

651
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,820
So look, like I said earlier, you can select a language.

652
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,700
You can change to Nihongo or English, which I think is pretty nice.

653
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,200
And the visual, the key visual is so cute!

654
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,840
Look how cute the character is!

655
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,600
So cute.

656
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,900
I love interactive shows.

657
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,160
Me too, me too!

658
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,920
So let's go check out this part!

659
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,580
Oh my gosh.

660
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,540
You guys.

661
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,520
I have to show you this.

662
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,180
This, I was wanting, like, to do.

663
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,180
I was wanting to do this since we first got here.

664
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,620
Because I did this earlier, actually.

665
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:39,920
Do you see?

666
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:41,700
Do you see?!

667
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,950
Oh!

668
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,950
Do you see?!

669
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:55,790
How cute!

670
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:59,270
Oh, and look, they have a bunch of other...

671
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,250
Oh, it's kind of blocking it.

672
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,790
If I click remove...

673
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,370
Am I still wearing them?

674
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:04,770
No!

675
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,810
I'm not still wearing them!

676
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,810
But look, you can get Kuromi!

677
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,710
You can get My Melody!

678
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,630
You can get Hello Kitty!

679
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:12,870
You can... What is that?

680
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:13,570
Little Twin Stars?

681
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:14,310
I think?

682
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,490
But we'll go back to...

683
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:18,610
Go back to...

684
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:22,170
To Cinnamoroll, of course.

685
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,610
So, yeah, yeah, yeah.

686
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:24,790
So cute, right?!

687
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,990
And then you can adjust it!

688
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:28,270
And, like, make it fit exactly to your head!

689
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:32,290
Wait, why aren't my legs working?

690
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,010
One moment.

691
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:34,150
Don't look.

692
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:36,650
Don't look!

693
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,490
Why aren't my legs working?

694
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,080
Maybe now?

695
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,240
Oh, sorry guys, I just realized my legs haven't been working.

696
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,760
That's strange.

697
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,640
I'm having all sorts of scuff today, so I'm really... I apologize.

698
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,360
But I hope that you guys are having fun, regardless.

699
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,040
Okay, let's keep going.

700
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,980
Oh, sorry, I just left without you guys.

701
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,260
Okay.

702
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,380
Look, it's so cute!

703
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,780
They have little photo areas...

704
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,720
That you can take pictures in.

705
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,740
My legs are even all kind of wonky.

706
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,200
What's going on?!

707
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,540
My legs, you can take pictures!

708
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,260
And, actually, hold on.

709
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,440
I gotta get my notes real quick.

710
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,540
I gotta get my notes.

711
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,160
I gotta get my notes.

712
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,620
There is a... there's a couple!

713
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,060
So, if you know...

714
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,760
If you know...

715
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,200
If you know...

716
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:46,920
If you know...

717
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:47,400
Puroland!

718
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,340
There's rides at Puroland.

719
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:53,060
So it means there's also rides at Virtual Puroland.

720
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,120
And one of them that we'll try and go on is the My Melody and Kuromi.

721
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,540
It's like a rhythm game?

722
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:01,760
Maybe less of a ride.

723
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,120
But...

724
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,140
It's extra special because...

725
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:06,820
Did you guys know?

726
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:11,820
That this year is My Melody's 50th anniversary?

727
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,840
And Kuromi's 20th anniversary?

728
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,040
I... I...

729
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,720
How?

730
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,020
50th!

731
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,560
I can't even believe that.

732
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:27,900
I can't even believe that.

733
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,480
Like, that's actually so crazy.

734
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,720
But yeah, so I'm gonna...

735
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,840
We're gonna try that out.

736
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,940
There's also a boat ride we can go on.

737
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,060
But first...

738
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,940
I'm maybe getting a little bit ahead of myself.

739
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:38,520
Maybe...

740
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,260
Let's explore.

741
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:40,840
Let's explore.

742
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,540
Let's have a good time.

743
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,200
Do you guys recognize?

744
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:47,720

Freaking out.

756
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,240

760
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,640
It's a gashapon?

761
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:13,960
How do I do it?

762
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,880
How do I do it?

763
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,080
Where?

764
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,740
Look at him!

765
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:27,880
Look how sad he is.

766
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,140
Chara Paki...

767
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:33,720
Chocolate...

768
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,480
Oh, they're selling a nation...

769
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:37,960
It's like an actual chocolate they're selling.

770
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,960
So these are actually all sponsors.

771
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,360
So...

772
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,220
Oh, I wanna try.

773
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,800
I'm gonna be in Japan next week.

774
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,460
I'm gonna be on the lookout for it.

775
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,880
Because look at this little pen.

776
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,120
Is it like a...

777
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,260
Cookie kind of chocolate.

778
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,800
Blueberry flavor.

779
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,940
Oh, each...

780
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:59,600
Each individual part.

781
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:01,460
So like the purple is a...

782
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:02,140
Wait, sorry, sorry.

783
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:05,740
The purple is like the blueberry flavor.

784
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,480
And then the pink parts are the...

785
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,920
Are the strawberry flavor.

786
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,460
And then...

787
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,360
Oh, like a puff chocolate.

788
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:18,520
And then white chocolate.

789
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,220
Wow.

790
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,080
And then look at this.

791
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,180
You can like break it apart.

792
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,270
And then you have your own...

793
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:28,520
That's what it is.

794
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:29,880
The Chara Paki.

795
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,500
So you can break it apart.

796
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,060
Oh my gosh, what is this?

797
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,220
I've played these games before.

798
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,540
Wait, I was doing it.

799
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,800
Oh my gosh, you're right.

800
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,540
You're right.

801
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,960
Oh

803
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,110
Wait, hold on.

804
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:09,430

00:51:37,350 --> 00:51:38,470
Bug, bug, bug, bug, bug.

811
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:48,530
Okay.

812
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:50,790
Ouch.

813
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:51,790
Don't say ouch.

814
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:53,730
Let's keep going.

815
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:55,570
So yeah, do you recognize?

816
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,170
Of course you do.

Of course you do.

818
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,510
Of course you do.

819
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:03,570
There we go.

820
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:05,290
It's Famipmart!

821
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:08,050
And look, you have Famipay.

822
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,710
Hi Famipay!

823
00:52:10,690 --> 00:52:11,270

825
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,990
Do you want to change your avatar?

826
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,210
Do I become him?

827
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:23,900
I'm Famipay!

828
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:24,920
What?

829
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,060
I'm 2D.

830
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,620
I'm flat!

831
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,240

Oh my hand!

834
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,830
I've returned to 2D.

835
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:52,810
Sometimes I can see myself behind me.

836
00:52:53,610 --> 00:52:55,350
I thought I was gonna become you.

837
00:52:56,650 --> 00:52:57,630
Okay, let me change.

838
00:52:57,930 --> 00:52:59,090
Let me change back.

But, hold on, let me show you guys too.

840
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,870
It's fun, it's fun, it's fun.

00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,910
Oh, it's fun, it's fun.

843
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:09,790
Where are you guys?

844
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,870
I lost you again.

845
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:13,650
Oh, hello.

846
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:15,430
Over here?

847
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:16,090
You see that?

848
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,130
You see that?

849
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:18,910
Is anybody hungry?

850
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:21,190
We got Famitiki!

851
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:22,650
Famitiki!

852
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,770
Real Famitiki!

853
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:25,730
Look!

854
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,160
Can I...

855
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,280
Can I eat it?

856
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,200
I'm gonna put it back real nicely.

857
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,920
Oh, we have...

858
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,300
We have Famipay Hello Kitty.

859
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:43,100
Famipay.

860
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,560
Hello Kitty Bear.

861
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:47,740
Famipay.

862
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,660
And then, also, look at this.

863
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,060
You guys know Chiki?

864
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:55,700
These... This is so cool, actually.

865
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,200
These actually work.

866
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,700
Where are you guys?

867
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,080
There you are.

868
00:53:59,320 --> 00:53:59,980
Oh, wait, hold on.

869
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,520
So these...

870
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,440
These work.

871
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:05,580
Ready?

872
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:06,020
Ready?

873
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,060
Say cheese!

874
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,420
Say cheese!

875
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:12,900
Did it work?

876
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,080
Oh my gosh.

877
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:17,160
I'm gonna see your beautiful selves.

878
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,100
See your beautiful selves.

879
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,820
There you are.

880
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,720
Your eyes were closed.

881
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:29,980
Oh, wait.

882
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,760
OK, let me...

883
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,580
You're a ghost!

884
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,820
It's my... This is my treasure.

885
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,460
It's our time at Puroland together.

886
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,040
It's my treasure.

887
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,820
My treasure Polaroid.

888
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:45,280
Do you wanna Chiki with me?

889
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,080
Do you wanna Chiki with me?

890
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,260
Do you wanna get a Polaroid from an actual Instax camera with me?

891
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:56,860
No, shut up.

893
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,200
Shut up.

894
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,980
OK, where did it go?

895
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:02,160
There it is.

896
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,020
OK.

897
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,660
We're taking a selfie.

898
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,340
We're taking a selfie.

899
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,140
We're taking a selfie.

900
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:13,820
Cheese!

901
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:15,960
Wait, hold on.

902
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:18,120
Cheese!

903
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,260
Can I get my fingers to work?

904
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,320
I'll just do doya.

905
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,440
Doya!

906
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:24,660
Cheese!

907
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,860
Let's see how it looks, let's see how it looks.

908
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:33,220
OK.

909
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,660
I'm a professional Chiki taker.

910
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,000
Wait.

911
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,840
You guys, this might be actually the best photo.

912
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,200
Look at this.

913
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,220
Look at...

914
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,460
It takes over, sorry.

915
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,460
That's kind of cool.

916
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,860
Wait, it takes over the thing.

917
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:53,780
Look at that.

918
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,880
Look how I got the Sanrio Puroland perfectly in the background.

919
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,060
How am I such a professional?

920
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,340
I told you I'm a professional.

921
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,320
I told you.

922
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,440
I told you.

923
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,540
That might be the best picture ever taken.

924
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:08,220
Ever.

925
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:08,800
Ever.

926
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,700
Fullscreen jumpscare.

927
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,040
Sorry.

928
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,820
That might be the best ever.

929
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,400
That might be the best ever do it.

930
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:14,820
I don't know.

931
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:15,300
I don't know.

932
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:16,960
I'm a natural.

933
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:17,880
I'm a natural.

934
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:19,080
I'm a natural.

935
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,220
But yeah, come and get your own Chikis as well.

936
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,880
Here at Puroland.

937
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,080
You can save that one.

938
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:29,520
Save that one.

939
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:29,960
Wait, hold on.

940
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:30,640
There you go.

941
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,800
There you go.

942
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,200
Save it.

943
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,540
Save it.

944
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:33,200
Save it.

945
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,780
Sanrio Virtual Festival 2035.

946
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:36,860
Save it.

947
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,180
Save it.

948
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:37,720
Save it.

949
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,120
Print screen.

950
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:38,940
Print screen.

951
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:39,960
Print screen.

952
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:42,980
Wait, hold on.

953
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:43,340
Hold on.

954
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,460
Let me...

955
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:44,920
Let me...

956
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:46,100
I'm actually going to print screen.

957
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,180
I'm actually going to get rid of Chat.

958
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,380
I want it for myself.

959
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,140
Goodbye Chat.

960
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,240
Print screen.

961
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:57,140
Print screen.

962
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:58,660
Print screen.

963
00:56:58,660 --> 00:56:58,760
Print screen.

964
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,240
And screenshot.

965
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,080
Okay, you guys are welcome back now.

966
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:10,860
Perfect.

967
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:12,260
There we go.

968
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,620
I'm the best ever do it.

969
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,340
And save.

970
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:17,900
Yay!

971
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:19,480
Alright.

972
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,260
Let me look at my notes once again.

973
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,540
I don't want to forget anything.

974
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,540
I don't want to forget anything.

975
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,120
So...

976
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,040
Let's go on the boat ride.

977
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,620
And maybe see if we can try the...

978
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,360
Wait, will I be able to do the rhythm game?

979
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,720
I can't hear anything.

980
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,200
Maybe you guys will have to come and try it instead.

981
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:56,980
We can go on the boat ride because it's also modeled off of the actual boat ride at real Pudoland.

982
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:02,440
But it's been recreated and upgraded for the virtual festival.

983
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,700
So, let's try it out.

984
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:05,240
Right, right, right?

985
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,160
Let's check it out, check it out, check it out.

986
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,900
And then...

987
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,200
And then...

988
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:15,280
Um...

989
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,740
Yeah.

990
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:16,220
Oh!

991
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,600
Of course, you know, there's other stuff in the main area around here as well.

992
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:22,760
So...

993
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:23,260
One moment.

994
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,420
My...

995
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:24,840
There we go.

996
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:25,140
Alright.

997
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,260
See, look how cute this is!

998
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:29,280
Nyantasia!

999
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,960
You have this, which is like avatar fashion.

1000
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:34,480
If you're...

1001
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:34,920
Whoa!

1002
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:39,460
If you're like really into styling your VRChat avatar, they got like specific...

1003
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,040
They have specific clothes.

1004
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,660
Sunrio clothes for...

1005
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,060
Oh, you know what I just noticed?

1006
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,340
I would have been perfect with my headband, huh?

1007
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,380
Dang.

1008
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,100
I love it!

1009
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,080
Oh my gosh, so cute!

1010
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,380
And then...

1011
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,820
Kuromi.

1012
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,300
Kuromi, Kuromi.

1013
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:04,600
Wait.

1014
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:12,560
Cheese.

1015
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,860
Cheese, cheese, cheese.

1016
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,920
Cheese, cheese, cheese.

1017
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:17,200
Ow!

1018
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,800
Cheese, cheese, cheese.

1019
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,640
Sorry about my legs, don't look at them.

1020
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:23,600
Cheese.

1021
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:25,460
Cheese.

1022
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:27,680
Cheese.

1023
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:29,360
Good job.

1024
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,380
Kuromi hearts!

1025
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:31,720
Kuromi.

1026
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:33,960
Alright.

1027
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,000
Let's go, go.

1028
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,340
Let's go, go inside.

1029
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:45,280
Oh yeah, and then here you can actually get real headbands.

1030
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,520
You can get the headbands.

1031
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,060
Alright.

1032
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:49,540
Whoa!

1033
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,480
Whoa!

1034
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,300
Welcome!

1035
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:59,360
Sunrio Virtual Festival 2035 is a virtual event set in a vast space within virtual Sunrio Puroland!

1036
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,320
Featuring virtual artists, virtual creators, and Sunrio characters.

1037
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:10,800
It's a new kind of world-class virtual festival where Sunrio fans and virtual experts alike can enjoy communicating with each other!

1038
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:12,260
Yeah.

1039
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,160
Let's go inside.

1040
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:21,420
This also looks exactly like the real entrance to Puroland.

1041
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,560
To the real Puroland.

1042
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:28,440
So they did a kind of crazy amazing job of recreating it.

1043
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,460
Welcome, welcome officially!

1044
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:37,060
Alright.

1045
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,860
Let's go find that boat ride.

1046
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,140
I'll take you on a journey.

1047
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,340
So, from what I can remember...

1048
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:49,860
Oh look, there's like a jukebox here.

1049
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,920
From what I can remember...

1050
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,300
Oh yeah, this is another thing!

1051
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,980
Pochacco's Nom Nom Party!

1052
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,800
I think this is also another show.

1053
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,520
There's also... there's like different floors.

1054
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,160
But from what I can remember...

1055
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,200
Upstairs...

1056
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,000
Like on that side of real Puroland is like restaurants and gift shops.

1057
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:21,400
Then there's more restaurants on that side upstairs.

1058
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,720
But we're going downstairs.

1059
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,720
Virtual boat ride!

1060
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,220
That should be it.

1061
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,560
I though...

1062
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,740
Look, there's also the parade.

1063
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:41,420
You can come and see the parade too.

1064
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:43,760
There's also the Virtual Puro Village.

1065
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,060
The Ryugu... Ryugu Castle.

1066
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,680
Oh, this is the... this is the...

1067
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,220
This is the...

1068
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,360
The rhythm game.

1069
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,460
So, I'm going to do a not public boat ride though.

1070
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,500
Give me one moment.

1071
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,480
So that we can enjoy our boat ride in peace.

1072
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,140
Perhaps.

1073
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:09,960
Okay.

1074
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,760
We're entering the boat ride!

1075
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,540
So, I really love Cinnamoroll, obviously, as you could see from before.

1076
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,240
But I also...

1077
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,080
Oops, sorry, my bad.

1078
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,580
I also really love Hanamaru Obake.

1079
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,080
So, if we see him...

1080
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:39,320
I mean, he's a ghost, so it's kind of my thing.

1081
01:02:39,940 --> 01:02:41,140
Anyway, let's go.

1082
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,580
Oh, cute!

1083
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,620
Sanrio characters.

1084
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,680
Boat ride!

1085
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,920
And this one is all of...

1086
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,320
So basically, in this one, Cinnamoroll receives an invitation from Kitty.

1087
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,080
From Hello Kitty, so...

1088
01:02:59,080 --> 01:02:59,960
Look!

1089
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,460
There's Kero-P!

1090
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,560
And Batsumaru!

1091
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,480
Pochacco!

1092
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,060
I can't remember the duck's name.

1093
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:09,120
Little Twin Stars!

1094
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,680
What's the duck's name?

1095
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:14,960
Spoilers.

1096
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:15,800
It's not spoilers.

1097
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:16,920
You're going to hear it.

1098
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,940
It literally says it right here!

1099
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,400
One day Cinnamon got...

1100
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,440
Hold on, my headset.

1101
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:23,620
My headset.

1102
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:30,400
So...

1103
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,640
My headset's been kind of like...

1104
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,680
The entire time, so I apologize.

1105
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,840
It's been a little funky.

1106
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,780
The VR... I really wanted the VR to happen, so I was just like...

1107
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:43,700
I'm going to make it happen, but...

1108
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:46,040
It's been a toughy one.

1109
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,580
Oh, here we go.

1110
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:50,580
Here, I'll just zoom in so you guys can read it too.

1111
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:54,580
One day, Cinnamon got a party invitation from Hello Kitty.

1112
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:58,260
Let's all go on an adventure with Cinnamon on a boat.

1113
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,580
Use the boat's...

1114
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:05,660
Oh, the Kirameki stick to help the Sanrio characters as you head to the party.

1115
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:08,940
Snap a commemorative photo during the boat ride too.

1116
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:09,460
Yay!

1117
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,300
Okay, that's actually how it is at the real Puroland too.

1118
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:14,380
You get to snap your own photo.

1119
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,060
Oh look, look, look!

1120
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:19,220
Let's board the boat.

1121
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:20,760
Click on a chair and sit on the boat.

1122
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:22,780
Four people can ride.

1123
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:25,020
Okay.

1124
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,120
Look at the giant pancake.

1125
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,560
Alright, where's the boat?

1126
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:30,360
Over here?

1127
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,260
Departure!

1128
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:32,380
Departure!

1129
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:34,020
Okay.

1130
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,120
I'm kind of nervous.

1131
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,320
Do you think there will be a drop?

1132
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,320
Oh.

1133
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:41,960
You're Avatar!

1134
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:42,340
Avatar!

1135
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:45,680
What?

1136
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,300
0.8 meters?

1137
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:48,660
1.5 meters?

1138
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:53,140
Look at my face.

1139
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,880
Do I look...

1140
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:55,980
Do you think I'll be okay?

1141
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,740
I must be so small for the ride.

1142
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:01,540
Look, I look so chill with the way my...

1143
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,540
My legs are messed up today.

1144
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,220
I don't know quite why.

1145
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,080
Okay, maybe let's just try it.

1146
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:12,060
Alright guys.

1147
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:13,760
I'm gonna sit in the back.

1148
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,480
I'm gonna sit in the back.

1149
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:18,220
Wait!

1150
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,400
Oh no!

1151
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:22,820
I'm not ready!

1152
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,600
Okay, alright.

1153
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:25,960
I'm gonna sit in the back.

1154
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:27,260
I'm sitting.

1155
01:05:29,420 --> 01:05:30,380
I'm gonna...

1156
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:30,940
Wait.

1157
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:33,500
There we go.

1158
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:35,200
Okay.

1159
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:36,920
You guys should be able to see now too.

1160
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:38,880
Start!

1161
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,340
Start!

1162
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:39,800
Start!

1163
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:40,300
Wait!

1164
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:41,520
I can't reach it!

1165
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:43,060
Start!

1166
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:43,620
Start!

1167
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,100
Start!

1168
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:44,800
Wait.

1169
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,120
I might have to...

1170
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:47,180
I might have to...

1171
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,040
Let me get out of the boat.

1172
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,560
Where are you guys anyway?

1173
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:56,440
Sit.

1174
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,000
Okay.

1175
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,280
Once everyone is ready, press the start button.

1176
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,200
Okay.

1177
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:02,820
Are you guys ready?

1178
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:04,860
Start!

1179
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:06,680
Oh!

1180
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:15,840
Cinnamon bun!

1181
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:26,260
Sorry.

1182
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,210
Oh, that's my head.

1183
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,310
I'm following you guys all around.

1184
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,780
That's kinda why I wanted to sit in the back.

1185
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,380
Let's go!

1186
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:05,740
Let's go!

1187
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:06,740
Let's go!

1188
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:14,460
This is so crazy for me.

1189
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:15,600
Original ride!

1190
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:18,740
Sick trick!

1191
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:22,300
I love the virtual world.

1192
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,100
Me too!

1193
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:30,950
Guys, unfortunately this is how I really sound like on rides.

1194
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:32,850
I'm screaming at everything.

1195
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:36,430
Oh!

1196
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:39,010
Oh!

1197
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:43,630
Cinnamon is over here.

1198
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:44,770
Look at me!

1199
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,090
Look at the lighting!

1200
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:47,230
Look at my hair!

1201
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:53,900
You can see his hair!

1202
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,100
He's so cute!

1203
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,860
I look really mean too.

1204
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:05,900
Wow!

1205
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:13,300
What is this?

1206
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,260
What is this?

1207
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:15,920
Bumblebee!

1208
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:21,000
Wow!

1209
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:21,480
Cute!

1210
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:27,800
I wish I could show you guys everything.

1211
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:31,560
He's bouncing everywhere!

1212
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,620
He's bouncing everywhere!

1213
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:34,680
I wish there was like a...

1214
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:35,940
Let me see if there is like a...

1215
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,120
Where am I?

1216
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,980
Oh, what the heck just happened?

1217
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,840
You guys...

1218
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,040
Why are you in a ball?

1219
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,040
I apologize for all the scuff you guys.

1220
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:12,500
Makes it authentic.

1221
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,940
Like little tin sours and me.

1222
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:20,740
Yeah!

1223
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:37,400
Where is Cinnamon?

1224
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,980
Oh there he is up there.

1225
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,060
He's over there.

1226
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,920
Oh my god.

1227
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:47,560
Where is he?

1228
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,600
This world...

1229
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:51,920
Wow!

1230
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,960
There is so much going on.

1231
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:55,920
Oh Kuromi!

1232
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:56,920
My mellow!

1233
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:00,860
Oh my god, they are so close.

1234
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,500
Wait, I have a stick here.

1235
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:06,740
Also, I didn't even show you guys.

1236
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:09,760
There is subtitles down here.

1237
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,980
It's not showing up on the camera for some reason.

1238
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:13,780
But there is subtitles.

1239
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:15,500
So if you are just like...

1240
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,580
I can't understand Nihongo!

1241
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,960
You have to come back and watch the round yourself!

1242
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,660
Because there are subtitles.

1243
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,360
Look, I'm shooting!

1244
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:36,940
I'm the popcorn!

1245
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,900
I'm shooting, I'm shooting.

1246
01:10:47,120 --> 01:10:48,120
Hold on.

1247
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,140
Thank you!

1248
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:17,580
I'll read the subtitles.

1249
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
Let's all take a picture!

1250
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,200
Remember this moment!

1251
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,040
Cheese!

1252
01:11:22,700 --> 01:11:24,020
Oh, the camera is over here!

1253
01:11:24,100 --> 01:11:24,420
Cheese!

1254
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,200
I wonder what it's going to look like.

1255
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:30,600
Wait, I'm so curious.

1256
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,420
What is this going to look like?

1257
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,000
We are back into the rainbow portal.

1258
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,400
There are so many things to...

1259
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:50,460
There you guys are.

1260
01:11:53,420 --> 01:11:53,900
Alright!

1261
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:56,460
Where are you?

1262
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:57,080
Oh, there you are.

1263
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:58,320
Yay!

1264
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,800
That was kind of chaotic, wasn't it?

1265
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:04,580
That was kind of chaotic.

1266
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:09,420
But yay!

1267
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,440
It was a short little ride.

1268
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:18,520
Definitely come back yourself and experience the real thing.

1269
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:19,320
Let's see.

1270
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:20,220
Play with me again?

1271
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:20,900
Thank you!

1272
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:24,340
Thanks for saving me from my Melody and Kuromi.

1273
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:25,120
So cute!

1274
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:26,780
I want to see her picture.

1275
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,300
I want to see her picture real bad.

1276
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,220
Saving her from the popcorn.

1277
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:35,260
Wait!

1278
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,160
Oh my gosh!

1279
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,180
Look how cute!

1280
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:43,300
I'm sitting in the boat!

1281
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:47,760
Stop!

1282
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,740
It's too cute!

1283
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,060
Wait, hold on.

1284
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,480
I need to screenshot this again.

1285
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:53,580
Hold on guys.

1286
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,260
Oh, sorry.

1287
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:55,260
Don't look.

1288
01:12:55,740 --> 01:12:56,560
I know you can see me.

1289
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,280
Wait, I'm trying to find my computer.

1290
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,280
Wait, where's my mouse?

1291
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,240
Oh, there it is.

1292
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,700
Okay, now I...

1293
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:04,680
Get rid of you guys.

1294
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:05,680
Goodbye.

1295
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:06,740
And then...

1296
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:07,600
Okay.

1297
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,820
How do I do this?

1298
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:10,260
No!

1299
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:10,800
No!

1300
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,680
Keep it there.

1301
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:15,760
No!

1302
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:15,860
No!

1303
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:19,420
How do I do it?

1304
01:13:19,780 --> 01:13:20,760
Where are you guys anyway?

1305
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:21,220
Wait.

1306
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:21,960
Download.

1307
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,340
Touch your camera.

1308
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,460
Oh, I can download it here.

1309
01:13:31,980 --> 01:13:32,780
Oh, maybe...

1310
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,180
You guys will take it for me, right?

1311
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:37,460
You guys will just keep it for me?

1312
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:39,480
Hold on.

1313
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:40,800
I think I need to move you guys.

1314
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:41,820
Come here.

1315
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:43,000
I'll grab you.

1316
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:43,980
Okay.

1317
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,440
There we go.

1318
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:45,900
Okay.

1319
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,480
There we go.

1320
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,100
There we go.

1321
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:52,820
There we go.

1322
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:54,200
And...

1323
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:54,900
Screenshot.

1324
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,940
Okay, you guys can go back now.

1325
01:13:58,680 --> 01:13:59,440
Yay!

1326
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,080
Yay!

1327
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,460
Alrighty.

1328
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,120
Yay!

1329
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,940
Oh my gosh, that picture mode is so cute though!

1330
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:13,740
Did you get it?

1331
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:14,400
I got it.

1332
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,940
I got it, I got it, I got it.

1333
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:20,740
Let's head back.

1334
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:23,060
Let's head back somewhere to talk.

1335
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:28,820
Donuts.

1336
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:33,560
Pancake.

1337
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:35,840
Oh, that's the departure.

1338
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:37,860
Oh, we came from this side.

1339
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:38,480
That's right.

1340
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:40,780
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1341
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,480
I think we might actually have to go back from...

1342
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:47,720
I think, yeah.

1343
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,080
Let me make a new instance.

1344
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,280
We have to go back through the world world.

1345
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:58,480
So, I only even got to show you guys just a tiny little bit of things that...

1346
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:02,600
That...

1347
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:05,200
Sunrayo Virtual Festival has.

1348
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:06,740
So...

1349
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:10,980
You know, like I said, there's other...

1350
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,860
There's the parade, there's other shows.

1351
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:16,510
There is a schedule, so you'll wanna, like, you know...

1352
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:18,540
You'll wanna check it.

1353
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:22,480
Links and everything, all that fun stuff...

1354
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,380
Is in...

1355
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,840
The description!

1356
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:29,180
In the description!

1357
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1358
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1359
01:15:33,180 --> 01:15:39,860
Let me get my notes one more time because there is one last thing, of course, to talk about when it comes to the festival.

1360
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:44,220
Which I did mention that there's more performances and all that fun stuff.

1361
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:51,380
And the creators, because there's actually artist performances as well as all the fun free things we did here.

1362
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:52,350
Just to...

1363
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:53,400
You guys...

1364
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,200
You do know that VRChat is free, right?

1365
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,180
VRChat is free!

1366
01:15:57,180 --> 01:16:00,740
So all of this that you can see and explore in here is all free.

1367
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,180
But if you want more specialized, cool, and exciting performances...

1368
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:08,440
There are the artist performances as well!

1369
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:13,220
And there's a total of 30 groups of artists that have been performing and...

1370
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:16,260
And are performing...

1371
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,200
Have performed...

1372
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,420
Actually, I think there's some happening, like, right now.

1373
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:21,740
It's kind of crazy.

1374
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:28,960
It's including Vtubers, Vsingers, anime characters, celebrities, and other VR creators.

1375
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:38,740
So, you might recognize some of the names such as K-Sun, or IronMouse, or Moona...

1376
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:40,500
Yeah!

1377
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:41,720
Tsukino Mito!

1378
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:45,740
There's a lot of very cool artists, so...

1379
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:48,500
That are performing.

1380
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:52,180
Oh, you might have heard of Aqua from Love Live!

1381
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:52,960
Yeah!

1382
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:59,260
So there are a variety of tickets and ways to watch the artist performances, so...

1383
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:02,800
You can use a VR headset, like how I am right now.

1384
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,860
You can use your computer or your phone.

1385
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:08,280
And the prices kind of vary depending on what kind of ticket you get.

1386
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:12,340
So we have a standard pass, which is for Quest and Android.

1387
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:15,020
It's 880 yen.

1388
01:17:15,260 --> 01:17:16,480
You can watch three streams.

1389
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:23,460
We have the standard pass for a VR headset, so you can watch the performances in VR.

1390
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,020
Which is kind of crazy.

1391
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,820
Which is 8,800 yen.

1392
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,000
Including a VR greeting, which is very cool.

1393
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,760
And also a standard pass, but with support goods.

1394
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:39,420
Similar to the other one, but it has the support goods, which is 12,100 yen.

1395
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:44,180
But there's also the spawn pass, which is the streaming site I mentioned earlier.

1396
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,180
Which is 4,400 yen.

1397
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,720
It's not VR, but you can watch some of the performances on your computer.

1398
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:59,760
As well as MetaMe, which is the MetaMe pass, which is 1,580 yen.

1399
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:05,380
Or rather, equivalent to that, or 3,500 yen equivalent-ish.

1400
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:07,720
But if you're like, what is MetaMe?

1401
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:08,640
I've never heard of that before.

1402
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,740
It is developed by NTT DoCoMo, which is the phone company, if you've heard of it.

1403
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:17,440
It's insanely famous in Japan.

1404
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:22,260
But MetaMe is a 3D stage that allows for multi-angle streaming.

1405
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,880
So you can see from different angles.

1406
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:30,660
And also, this is really cool actually, live effects based on fan interactions.

1407
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:38,460
Basically, you can kind of create the effects that happen during the show.

1408
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,720
Which is very, very neat, I think.

1409
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:49,000
And so yeah, like I mentioned earlier, some of the featured artists for MetaMe are...

1410
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,460
Moona from Hololive ID.

1411
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,220
Pmaru-sama, which you guys might have heard her before.

1412
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:58,840
And a few others, of course.

1413
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:00,840
V for Mirai is one of them.

1414
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:08,540
So if you'd like a more immersive experience watching the shows, check out the Sunrio Virtual Festival on MetaMe.

1415
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,700
And tickets can be purchased online.

1416
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,540
Links in the description.

1417
01:19:16,660 --> 01:19:21,620
To get the ticket, you'll have to use MetaMe's internal currency called Metamo.

1418
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,660
That's why I was saying the MetaMe pass is like ¥1580 equivalent.

1419
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,720
Because you're purchasing the Metamo currency.

1420
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:33,730
But if you have any questions, they have an FAQ page.

1421
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,960
So you can check it out.

1422
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:38,980
Yeah, V for Mirai is tonight.

1423
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,960
I think Kei-san was also tonight, or Moona.

1424
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:50,100
Like I said, the festival is until March 9th.

1425
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,380
So you still have some time.

1426
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:57,040
Definitely check out the schedule to see when the different free performances are here.

1427
01:19:57,340 --> 01:20:02,120
Because like I said, if you want to see the one that we just saw again, too.

1428
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:08,400
The one that we just saw with probably a better view than what I gave you.

1429
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,160
Then you can come and watch it for free.

1430
01:20:14,280 --> 01:20:16,820
Just make sure you find what time it is on the schedule.

1431
01:20:16,940 --> 01:20:20,580
Because it's not like you can just hop into the world and go watch it.

1432
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,620
It's kind of on a... It's like a real schedule.

1433
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:25,560
Like you're actually going to the park, you know?

1434
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,220
But virtually!

1435
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:31,280
And the parade and all that fun stuff.

1436
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:34,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1437
01:20:36,440 --> 01:20:38,580
Be sure to come check it out.

1438
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,940
If you're interested in some of the other live performances by the creators, grab a ticket.

1439
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,080
Don't miss out, don't miss out.

1440
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:54,660
I hope you guys enjoyed checking out Puroland with me!

1441
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,920
Like I kind of mentioned before, I've only been to the real Puroland just one time before.

1442
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,180
But it was so fun!

1443
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,640
I actually went with Doki.

1444
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,120
A long while ago.

1445
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:12,380
What is that?

1446
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:14,760
I think my cat is rebelling against me.

1447
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,040
No?

1448
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:18,360
Something just moved in my room.

1449
01:21:18,900 --> 01:21:19,460
It's haunting.

1450
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,480
By me.

1451
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:22,500
But yeah!

1452
01:21:26,900 --> 01:21:28,440
Pies is in here actually.

1453
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:31,580
She's been just chilling on my chair.

1454
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,260
But I hope you enjoyed!

1455
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,700
I hope you guys had fun!

1456
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:43,160
And I will see you guys next time!

1457
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,260
Check out the festival!

1458
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:46,920
Thank you again...

1459
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,500
To... thank you again... Sanrio... Sanrio Festival.

1460
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:57,480
Thank you Virtual Sanrio Festival for the sponsor.

1461
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,760
And I hope you guys have a good day!

1462
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:00,420
Have a good night!

1463
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:00,800
Thank you!

1464
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,100
See you!

1465
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:06,920
Bye bye!

1466
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,480
Wait... wait... one second...

1467
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:10,620
One second...

1468
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,140
One second!

1469
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:16,340
One second!

1470
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:19,980
One second, one second, one second...

1471
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,620
One second, one second, one second...

1472
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:24,640
One second, one second, one second...

1473
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,340
One second, one second.

1474
01:22:36,610 --> 01:22:37,210
Oh no!

1475
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:37,890
I lost him!

1476
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:39,810
Anyway, well, I have this at least.

1477
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:40,750
Bye bye!

1478
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:41,430
Bye bye!

1479
01:22:41,510 --> 01:22:42,010
Bye bye!

1480
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:43,010
Bye bye!

1481
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:43,430
Bye bye!

1482
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:43,930
Bye bye!

1483
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:44,670
Thank you!

1484
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,910
I was gonna wear the ears.

1485
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:47,830
Bye bye!

1486
01:22:48,010 --> 01:22:48,350
Bye bye!

1487
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:48,910
Bye bye!

1488
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:55,130
Get inside my brain!

1489
01:22:57,990 --> 01:22:59,950
Wait, where's my mouse?

1490
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:01,910
Um, hold on.

1491
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:03,730
I'll end the stream when I can find it.

1492
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:03,990
Okay.

1493
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:08,420
Bye!

1494
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:13,880
Oh, I lost it again.

1495
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,200
Wait, this is so awkward.

1496
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,320
Guys, I don't know where I'm clicking.

1497
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:18,120
I can't see anything.

1498
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,460
Oh, wait a second.

1499
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,520
Where's my mouse?

1500
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:30,020
I give up.

1501
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:31,220
There it is.

1502
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:31,900
Okay, bye bye!
