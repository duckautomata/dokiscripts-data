1
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,390
Uh-oh.

2
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:08,500
Uh-oh, there it is.

3
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,740
Silly.

4
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,140
Silly.

5
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:27,900
Welcome today to Devil May Cry 2.

6
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,380
Hello.

7
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,620
Hello.

8
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,520
Hello.

9
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,020
Hi.

10
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,480
I don't know who to play.

11
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,560
Who do I play as?

12
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,240
Wait, where is my controller?

13
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:47,620
There it is.

14
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,640
Dante?

15
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Let me do a poll.

16
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,000
Let me do a poll.

17
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,480
Start a poll.

18
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,920
Who do I play as?

19
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,420
Dante.

20
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,620
What's her name?

21
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:07,900
Lucia?

22
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,020
It won't make too much of a difference.

23
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,180
Do two playthroughs.

24
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,420
Obviously, that's the correct answer.

25
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,280
Two playthroughs.

26
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:23,960
First is Dante.

27
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,160
Pick Lucia.

28
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,060
As a fan of DMC2, I personally find the playthrough with Lucia to be more enjoyable.

29
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,620
The game is not the greatest.

30
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,260
At least you admit that.

31
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,620
You look more derpy than usual, Minky.

32
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,200
I don't know what you're talking about.

33
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,960
I don't know what you're talking about.

34
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,260
Oh, so many people are saying pick Dante.

35
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,340
What?

36
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,920
Everybody knows that you pick the sexy ladies.

37
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,260
So you have a nice butt to look at when you're running around.

38
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,140
It's my birthday.

39
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,880
Shin Solar!

40
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,540
Praise the sun!

41
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,740
Happy birthday to you.

42
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,000
Happy birthday to you.

43
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,040
Happy birthday Shin Solar.

44
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,900
Happy birthday to you.

45
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,500
Happy birthday!

46
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:31,580
Back to your regularly scheduled Minto.

47
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,380
The poll has spoken.

48
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,340
It is Dante's hour.

49
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,060
Would you like to continue?

50
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:42,740
Yes.

51
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,460
Sorry to hear the news about one of the buildings in Akiba.

52
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,860
I was fortunate enough to get some pictures there a couple of days ago.

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,280
I wish it was just one building in Akiba.

54
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,760
I also wish it wasn't hotels.

55
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,780
They just built another Appa.

56
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,460
Oh yeah!

57
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:10,860
Grandma!

58
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,710
Oh my god.

59
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,470
I couldn't read that.

60
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,090
It's too fast.

61
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,170
I can't read it.

62
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,170
Oh yeah, baby!

63
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,010
Who's gonna use the sword, huh?

64
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,010
Evan and Ivory.

65
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,890
All the way, baby.

66
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,050
Oh, you guys aren't watching...

67
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,800
Hold on.

68
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,340
I knew this was gonna happen.

69
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,880
And I was like, when I select a choice, make sure I select...

70
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,120
Make sure I also make it so that they can see the screen.

71
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,820
Hold on, maybe it will show up.

72
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,720
There it is!

73
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,140
Wait, hold on.

74
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,780
There we go.

75
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,340
You guys missed all the best parts!

76
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh my god, the building is pregnant.

77
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,040
Oh, it's a girl!

78
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:53,960
Spoilers?

79
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,950
How is this bad?

80
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,510
It looks so good, you guys!

81
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,930
This looks so good!

82
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,890
Lanny, happy birthday!

83
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,110
Wait, it's your birthday too.

84
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,530
I get to catch a mainstream on my birthday.

85
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,770
Happy birthday!

86
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,130
Happy birthday to you!

87
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,850
Happy birthday to you!

88
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,850
Happy birthday dear Leonie!

89
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,650
Happy birthday to you!

90
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,690
Happy birthday!

91
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,930
Not putting the game on the screen is better.

92
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:43,170
Oh, here we can watch from the beginning, guys.

93
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,370
Now, just ignore the last 3 minutes and put this over it instead.

94
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,330
DMC2 is one of the games of all time.

95
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,950
I'm here to just get through it.

96
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:58,750
I'll be honest.

97
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,010
People have been saying it's so bad.

98
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,910
I want to make my own opinions, but also...

99
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:15,390
It would be so bad to have DMC1, DMC3, DMC4, DMC5...

100
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:19,790
I don't think I'd be able to handle not having 2 in the list.

101
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,010
It would be driving me crazy.

102
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,350
I have to remember how to play the game.

103
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,470
We're flipping in the air!

104
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,350
Oh my god, it's Mothra.

105
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:40,930
Wow, Monkey!

106
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:41,830
Minky!

107
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,450
Minky, Minky and Devil May Cry.

108
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,590
OK, we get to see the building give birth again.

109
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,100
I'm on fire in Malaysia!

110
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,220
When I was a kid, I got 2 games a year for Christmas.

111
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,400
Birthday and Christmas.

112
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,060
I chose Devil May Cry 2 as one of those games and it still hurts inside.

113
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,100
How would you have known?

114
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:27,040
It's going to be awesome to see this become your favorite entry in the franchise after months of people telling you about it.

115
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,800
You'll hate it.

116
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,200
Wouldn't that be awesome if I'm just like, what are you talking about everybody?

117
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,240
DMC2 is peak!

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,580
It's cinema!

119
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,990
OK, here we go.

120
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,750
We're just jumping right into it everybody.

121
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,010
Darkness.

122
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,890
Oh my god.

123
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,350
Different cutscenes?

124
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,990
Nah, I don't think I'll do it.

125
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,370
I'm sorry.

126
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,610
Sparda!

127
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,620
Oh my god, they got boobs.

128
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,800
These are real harpies.

129
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,740
Oh my god.

130
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,120
Oh yeah.

131
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,380
How's the audio by the way?

132
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,660
A bit low.

133
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:49,760
There we go.

134
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,440
Heads or tails?

135
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,500
Tails, because you're always going to see my behind.

136
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,660
Good job Dante.

137
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,780
Dante looks so good in this game though.

138
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,400
He needs a few more belts.

139
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,780
Cute!

140
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,620
She's so cute!

141
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,920
I understand I play DMC2 after 1 because I like to play in chronological order.

142
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,500
Yeah.

143
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,620
Oh we're going to...

144
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,500
Brazil?

145
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,720
Brazil?

146
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,880
Alright, here we go.

147
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,440
What system was this for?

148
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,900
PS2?

149
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,280
PS2 again.

150
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,840
My ex-friends recommended me this game.

151
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,040
Gonzalo!

152
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,740
Thanks for a year!

153
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,720
I got 0 rorbs, but that won't be for so long.

154
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,860
Can I kill this thing?

155
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,480
Nope.

156
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,140
Can I slice it?

157
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,060
How do I use my sword?

158
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,120
Oh there we go.

159
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,400
Ah hi, I'm a ruler.

160
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,160
Is it acquired taste?

161
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,440
Ok.

162
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,440
I thought it was going to ask me what kind of game mode I wanted to play on.

163
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,120
Like easy mode, hard mode...

164
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,640
DMC2 mode, you know?

165
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,300
I thought it would ask.

166
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,340
Minto mode.

167
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,680
Nemoro, thanks for the 5 gifted.

168
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,410
Takes place last in the series.

169
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,470
It's last in the timeline?

170
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,190
No way.

171
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,030
Oh my god, that guy was eating that.

172
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:34,910
Oh,

173
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,050
that's false.

174
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,790
Just kidding.

175
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,430
No it doesn't.

176
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,750
Oh my god, stop spreading lies on the internet to me.

177
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,150
I would never know.

178
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,970
I'm not going in there just yet.

179
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,010
Wow, there's so much here.

180
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,510
Oh yeah baby.

181
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,090
Wait, am I going too far?

182
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:00,870
I'm trying to...

183
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,790
What the?

184
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,610
Oh, that's really trippy looking.

185
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:08,990
I'm trying to explore.

186
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,390
I don't want to go too far.

187
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:17,470
There's rorbs everywhere.

188
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:19,770
Oh my gosh.

189
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,570
The most elusive rorb.

190
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,630
The train rorb.

191
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,610
Wait, do I go?

192
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,070
Hold on.

193
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,550
Before we get too far.

194
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,640
There's some more I wanted to see on the other side.

195
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,360
I guess.

196
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,340
I thought there was another...

197
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,460
I can't tell if I can go in there or not.

198
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,460
I'm scared to try.

199
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Over here.

200
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,760
Oh, there's...

201
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,760
Dang, I thought it was a...

202
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,400
Okay, I was going the right way.

203
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,240
The entire time.

204
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,420
Wait, what is in here though?

205
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,380
If I fall...

206
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,870
Worth it for the rorb.

207
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,050
Rich for the rorb.

208
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:22,730
I'm getting rich up in here.

209
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,590
Oh my god, his...

210
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,050
His like...

211
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,310
His sneakers.

212
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,210
Sounds like when Barbie is running.

213
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,450
In the Barbie movies.

214
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:37,770
And it's just such a nice little...

215
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:42,990
Such a nice sound.

216
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,410
Are those guys going to come alive?

217
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,510
No!

218
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,410
Time to fight, baby.

219
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,730
What if I just do this the whole time?

220
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,150
Oh my god,

221
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,400
this is what you guys tell me to do, right?

222
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,000
That's the strat?

223
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,640
Just...

224
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,140
It's loud?

225
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,520
Sorry, I had to turn it up because you guys said it was quiet earlier.

226
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,660
La, la, la, la, la...

227
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,900
Punch, punch... I mean...

228
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,920
Shoot, shoot, shoot...

229
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,440
Give me your rorbs, please.

230
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,070
I wonder how fast I can quote-unquote speedrun this.

231
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,830
I'm not really made out to be a speedrunner though.

232
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,410
Because I like to just run everywhere.

233
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,370
And look at things, like that bird.

234
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,530
The bird on the wall.

235
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,790
We are in like a whole city though.

236
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,210
Look at that thing.

237
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,890
Oh yeah, we get our own sexy ladies.

238
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:20,890
Oh my god, ouch, ouch.

239
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,590
Get out Dante, get out Dante!

240
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,270
Nice.

241
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,030
Nice.

242
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,090
Oh, there's more.

243
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,470
I'm just gonna jump and shoot.

244
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,770
Oh no, my rorb!

245
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:49,630
Give it back!

246
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:51,830
Okay, nice.

247
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:55,390
Oh my gosh, they even had traffic lights.

248
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,790
This place is crazy.

249
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,210
Rip the rorb.

250
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,810
Maybe there's more over here.

251
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,230
I'll take the stairs this time.

252
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,730
Like a proper gentleman.

253
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,230
Okay, nevermind.

254
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,650
There's nothing here.

255
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,880
Guys, we are in Brazil.

256
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,020
Maybe I do need to jump over.

257
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,600
I need to become Spider-Man.

258
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,900
Oh my gosh.

259
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,560
You can't get me if I'm high in the air!

260
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,130
Look at...

261
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,270
The way I just...

262
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,230
The way I just float in the air is so fun.

263
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:58,890
Okay.

264
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,390
Oh, I just needed to hop over it.

265
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,190
Oh my god.

266
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,780
And then once you're down, then I get you.

267
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,300
Once you're down, then I get you.

268
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,620
Once you're down, then I get you.

269
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,100
Once you're down, then I get you.

270
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,060
Once you're down...

271
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,260
Oh wow, he's also flying!

272
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,820
Okay.

273
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,160
Oh my god.

274
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,820
And then I can switch to you.

275
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,400
And then I switch to you.

276
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,020
Wait, how do I switch?

277
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,800
Oh, nevermind.

278
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,980
That guy is not even coming towards me though.

279
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,680
Oh, now he is.

280
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,400
And then I switch to you.

281
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,700
Are they coming up behind me?

282
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,840
Did I hear that behind me?

283
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,620
I don't even know where I'm shooting.

284
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm just shooting somebody.

285
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,440
I love auto-target.

286
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,620
Alright.

287
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,380
Sorry.

288
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,260
I'm shooting, I'm shooting.

289
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,020
If you shoot long enough you'll hit something.

290
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,480
Exactly.

291
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,080
Oh my god.

292
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,300
I'm shooting at somebody.

293
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,820
Where are you?

294
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,760
Where are you?

295
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,900
I think I killed him.

296
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,340
Okay.

297
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,140
I'm just gonna keep going.

298
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,820
Well, they make that kind of difficult now, don't they?

299
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,100
Go down.

300
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:35,820
Go down, buddy.

301
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,480
Go down.

302
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,580
Go down.

303
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,660
Go down.

304
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,940
Or up, you know, whichever.

305
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,020
Oh, there's more.

306
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,380
They're never gonna stop.

307
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,740
No, please.

308
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,960
I mean, yes, keep paying me, but...

309
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,380
There he goes, off the screen.

310
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,120
What was over here?

311
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,620
Oh my gosh, I saw another roar, but...

312
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,360
I'm afraid to jump for it and I can't...

313
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,680
There's no way to change the camera.

314
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,000
There.

315
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,180
How do I get to that?

316
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,080
Will the water kill me?

317
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,960
Oh, come on.

318
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:18,820
Leave me alone.

319
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,680
I'm leaving.

320
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:25,980
I see.

321
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,400
We can all run away from our problems.

322
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,140
Be like Dante.

323
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,320
I got a yellow...

324
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,460
Oh.

325
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:33,760
Gold?

326
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,340
A gorb.

327
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,040
A crystal generated with the mortal's power of resurrection.

328
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,620
Oh, shoot.

329
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,780
They're not letting me leave this time, huh?

330
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,600
They're not letting me leave this time, huh?

331
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,620
There he goes.

332
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,900
Off the screen.

333
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,960
Is this the...

334
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,580
Is this the same as before where I need the yorbs to...

335
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,860
To save?

336
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,180
Oh my gosh.

337
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,520
I'm styling in the air.

338
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,280
You resurrect.

339
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,500
It revives if you die.

340
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,520
I don't know where I'm shooting at, but...

341
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,440
It's probably somebody.

342
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,340
There he goes.

343
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,020
Off the screen.

344
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,460
Oh my god.

345
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,500
I got injured.

346
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,500
Wait.

347
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,360
Did I kill him?

348
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,500
Oh my god.

349
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:41,780
Please.

350
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,420
Go away.

351
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,220
Haven't I beat enough of you?

352
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,500
Meow, meow.

353
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,140
Do you get style points in this?

354
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,680
Or is it just because I'm not using my sword at all?

355
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,840
Oh, what's devil trigger in this?

356
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,200
Oh.

357
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm just too good.

358
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,190
Isn't he stylish?

359
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,170
I think I've reached maximum.

360
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,090
Quite honestly.

361
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,310
Oh, F4.

362
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,090
Shut up.

363
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,190
R1?

364
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:25,490
No.

365
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:26,990
That's this.

366
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:28,010
This is R1.

367
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:28,850
Oh, L1.

368
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,810
R3?

369
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,390
Everybody is giving me something different.

370
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,590
Nobody knows.

371
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:35,550
That's okay.

372
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
I'm destroying the city's infrastructure.

373
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,510
Oh, a thing.

374
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:53,630
This is actually terrible, terrible.

375
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,390
Terrible architecture.

376
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,410
Oh there.

377
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,610
Statue of a god that is controlling time.

378
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:03,150
You can gain powers by offering the rorbs.

379
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,370
This is a menu.

380
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:12,430
Ten...

381
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,210
Thousand rorbs!

382
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,870
That's never been so expensive.

383
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:29,290
Five thousand rorbs.

384
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,870
I have nothing.

385
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,470
I'm poor as hell.

386
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,290
I'm just a poor guy.

387
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,050
If you spam circle, you'll just flip.

388
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,090
Wait, which one is circle?

389
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,230
X or B?

390
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,310
I need that.

391
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:00,590
The game is telling me.

392
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,050
But what about...

393
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:07,530
Wait.

394
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,810
I got a...

395
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,010
I got a blorb!

396
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,890
Oh, so I can jump in here.

397
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,930
I've been missing out this whole time.

398
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,130
Blorb flag...

399
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,250
Fragment.

400
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,290
I started to say flagment.

401
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:31,810
I think I'm trapped in here.

402
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,330
Just kidding.

403
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,930
I'm too good.

404
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,550
I'm styling.

405
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,930
Yeah, Mike Tyson's ass!

406
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,790
Thanks for the gift dude!

407
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,090
Okay, let's just keep going.

408
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,580
Flagment.

409
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:47,980
Oopsie.

410
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,920
It was a trap.

411
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:52,800
Oh my god.

412
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,040
These are the wimpiest spikes I've ever seen.

413
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,240
Ever in my afterlife.

414
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,160
I'm just gonna keep pressing B.

415
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,100
Oh my god!

416
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
They're hideous monkeys.

417
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,290
I have to also shoot though.

418
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,890
Don't worry.

419
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,310
Don't worry.

420
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,050
They won't get me up here.

421
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,660
Okay, there look to be way more monkeys than before, but...

422
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,560
Are they doing anything?

423
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,440
Are they gonna move?

424
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:37,000
Nevermind, they're moving.

425
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:37,980
They're on the move.

426
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,940
How are you finding it so far?

427
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm having so much fun.

428
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:49,800
L1?

429
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,960
Goodbye, minkies.

430
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,140
Minky, be gone.

431
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:54,920
Minky!

432
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,400
Minky, be gone!

433
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,700
Oh, more minky.

434
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,520
Oh my god, invisible minkies!

435
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,080
Nevermind.

436
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,580
Minky!

437
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:06,660
Minky!

438
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,680
Death to the minky!

439
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,380
Alright, nice.

440
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,060
Hold on, I'm trying to get some more rorbs.

441
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,200
I gotta get paid here.

442
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,380
Oh no, that's a trick.

443
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,160
Trick.

444
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,940
That's a trick.

445
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,620
Okay, nevermind.

446
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,040
Goodbye, minkies!

447
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,500
Sayonara!

448
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,280
Sayonara!

449
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,580
Come here.

450
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,270
There he goes, up the wall.

451
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,930
Stupid little minky.

452
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,610
They threw something at me.

453
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,950
Hold on, let me get paid.

454
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,070
Get money, get paid.

455
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:47,870
Here we go.

456
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,450
Filling the devil trigger gauge is a pain.

457
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,030
And this one?

458
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,090
A key!

459
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,690
Iron bar door.

460
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:00,790
Oh, can I make money?

461
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,350
Oh my god.

462
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,210
Nice.

463
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,370
Nice, nice.

464
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,230
I need lots of money.

465
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,050
When mink goes...

466
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,730
This one.

467
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,070
You have used the key.

468
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:18,710
Perfect.

469
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,730
Thanks.

470
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,630
On those wimpy, wimpy spikes.

471
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,050
I could've just taken those spikes down, let's be honest.

472
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,930
I like being outside.

473
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:28,750
It's kinda fun.

474
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,430
I like the outdoors atmosphere.

475
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,430
Makes me feel like...

476
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,670
You smell that smoggy, smog air.

477
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,570
Look at that.

478
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:40,990
That is not fresh.

479
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,970
That air is...

480
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,650
No wonder nobody lives here.

481
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,830
It's very contaminated.

482
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,410
Could've crawled into the pipe.

483
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,590
That's what I'm saying, right?

484
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,570
Oh man.

485
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,910
I should've stayed on the ceilings.

486
00:29:57,790 --> 00:29:58,630
There we go.

487
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,250
Let's just leave.

488
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:02,330
Is that a...

489
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,530
Is this bait or...

490
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,010
Follow the road.

491
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,660
That's not me.

492
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,140
Madam.

493
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,140
Makes me wanna go touch grass.

494
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
His eyes are piercing.

495
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:29,330
Oh my god.

496
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,790
I love touching grass.

497
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,530
Who are you?

498
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,170
I'm Minto.

499
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,510
Dante doesn't talk for shit in this game?

500
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:41,070
What is it?

501
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,170
What is this?

502
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,130
What is this?

503
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:45,950
Metal Gear Solid V?

504
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:47,630
Guys, we got a B!

505
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,160
Nothing even happened in that...

506
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,840
In that mission.

507
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,480
How many missions are in this game, by the way?

508
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,560
DMC director Hideki Itsuno was not involved in DMC2 until 6 months before the game was out.

509
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,660
They asked him to do his best to salvage the project.

510
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,460
Oh my god.

511
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,980
18 missions.

512
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,280
Okay.

513
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,360
Yeah, I heard...

514
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,340
I did, like, how long to beat on this game and it said 5 hours.

515
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,340
If you just wanna, like, play.

516
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,980
So give or take, like, a couple hours to that.

517
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,280
Mathieu?

518
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:31,560
Oh!

519
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,800
She just crawled out of the ground.

520
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,520
Paid for Boomer!

521
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:41,680
Check out 10% off gamers...

522
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,500
Thank you, Shaden.

523
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:49,240
Your friend is always responding to you on Twitter.

524
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,880
It's so funny.

525
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,550
Oh my god, he speaks.

526
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,670
Dante.

527
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:00,810
Okay.

528
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,630
I just forget how to say it.

529
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,170
Oh?

530
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,490
Why was there a dramatic pause?

531
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,910
A man?

532
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,650
What the hell is that?

533
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,290
Oh my god, that's what they're gonna do to Akiba.

534
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:36,870
No!

535
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,310
How's your tails?

536
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,970
Ma'am, I don't think you should be going out.

537
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:01,060
There's just like some...

538
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,510
About Papa?

539
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:10,450
Papa!

540
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:10,810
Papa!

541
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,370
Guideposts for the Hunter, chapter 1, clause 8.

542
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:27,510
Guys, should I just always level up my gun in this game?

543
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:30,870
Should I wait for the 10,000 buckaroos?

544
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:34,670
Yes?

545
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,310
Okay.

546
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:42,750
Using the sword and melee for one fight, just so you have an idea.

547
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,470
Okay, I'll try.

548
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,610
I'll try.

549
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,250
No, I liked being outside!

550
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:57,820
Hello?

551
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,480
Oh, there we go.

552
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,830
Wish me luck on 14 ultimate.

553
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,790
Good luck, bro!

554
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,270
You got this.

555
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,830
I'm teeny tiny.

556
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,030
Oh my god, the camera changes.

557
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,650
Hello?

558
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,150
Anybody in here?

559
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:24,470
Hello?

560
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:33,530
I'll go that way in a second.

561
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,250
There's another way.

562
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,930
Woah, there's so many ways.

563
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:42,070
Do you plan on doing both Dante and Lucia or just Dante?

564
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:42,690
Just Dante.

565
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,730
The cutscenes are different, people said.

566
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,850
But I can just watch them on YouTube.

567
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,460
Oh, I'm supposed to break all of them.

568
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,560
Wait, I didn't go down the holes though.

569
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,700
Oh shit.

570
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,880
Oh, it's just a bunch of little bats.

571
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,440
Oh no, bats!

572
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:19,210
Okay.

573
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,530
Oh, he's trying to open like a little... Okay.

574
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,930
I thought they were like all in their own hallways.

575
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,710
This one has...

576
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,230
A pickle.

577
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,710
What in the...

578
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,850
Oh yeah, baby!

579
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,390
Oh yeah, baby!

580
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,890
Oh yeah, baby!

581
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,670
Oh yeah, baby!

582
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,690
Oh, just kidding.

583
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:51,790
How can I... Can I lock... I wish I could lock on but it's...

584
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:52,510
Oh, it's over.

585
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:53,170
No!

586
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:54,290
Wait!

587
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:01,980
3000!

588
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,540
You guys were so close.

589
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,440
Where did that open anyway?

590
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,620
I can't get a grasp of how any of these...

591
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,170
I can't get a grasp on how any of these rooms are supposed to look because...

592
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,250
I don't... I can't move the camera.

593
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,530
Where did... Is this where I came from?

594
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:32,030
Already on mission 2 and Dante hasn't gotten stabbed through the chest.

595
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,030
The sword... chest...

596
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,650
I can't enunciate today.

597
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,570
What is wrong with me?

598
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:39,610
I think it's because my eyes are like this.

599
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:41,810
My eyes are up here.

600
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,730
Where am I going?

601
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:43,130
This way?

602
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:47,330
My dearest Melpert, it has come to our attention that you forced a ghost maid to...

603
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,890
A ghost maid to complete your DMC 2 playthrough.

604
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,310
We are disappointed in you, Melpert.

605
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,290
What are you talking about?

606
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,510
Wait, what is...

607
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,730
What happened to all the things that I opened up?

608
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,070
Did it get sealed up?

609
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,070
Did I mess up?

610
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,330
Aw man, I think I messed up.

611
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:05,690
Hi, Melpert!

612
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,410
Nah, I'm Minto.

613
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,280
How's it, Melpert?

614
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
Good secret.

615
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,240
Good secret, good secret.

616
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,340
Oh my god, nice!

617
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,560
Maybe I should fall down the other one.

618
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,860
Wait, should I?

619
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,220
Gosh.

620
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,540
Should I fall down the other one?

621
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:39,170
It's a Vinny bit.

622
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,810
If I ever meet him, I'll ask him.

623
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:48,210
I'm sure Mitara would introduce us.

624
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,940
I just love seeing these, like...

625
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,660
I wish the camera angle stayed and all you saw was Dante just sometimes jumping out of the hole.

626
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,500
Like this.

627
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,190
Aw man, it was a trick.

628
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,930
Played DMC 2.

629
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:27,010
I'm playing DMC 2!

630
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,090
Oh, this is this room.

631
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:31,450
I'm playing, I'm playing DMC 2!

632
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,330
I hope you're happy for me!

633
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:35,250
I hope you're happy!

634
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,190
Don't forget to use your guns.

635
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,470
Oh my swords!

636
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,030
I gotta use the sword, huh?

637
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,870
I don't have the...what's it called anymore?

638
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,030
Wait, where the hell am I supposed to go here?

639
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,120
I'm playing DMC 2.

640
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,440
I hope you're happy for me.

641
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,960
Is there a map?

642
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,160
Look at...

643
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,000
Wait, he looks different here.

644
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,780
He's got no boobs.

645
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,960
This is sad.

646
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:12,800
DM...wait, here?

647
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,860
Oh, I found it.

648
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,060
Is this a puzzle?

649
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,320
I'm thinking of...all I can think of is Astro Bot right now.

650
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,380
This is technically a puzzle.

651
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,700
Quotes!

652
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,420
Ebony and Ivory is more effective than the pool noodle on your back.

653
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,120
Don't call her that!

654
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,080
She's beautiful!

655
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,950
None of them sound different.

656
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,510
Am I overthinking it?

657
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,570
Oh my gosh, wait, hold on.

658
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,550
The textures on the ceiling don't even line up.

659
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,090
You see that?

660
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:24,150
I see it.

661
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,050
Oh, go to the door and interact with it first.

662
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:36,650
Light a blue flame and then the way will be opened.

663
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,090
What the...

664
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,590
Am I a dog?

665
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:25,970
Oh, that's all I...

666
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,030
Oh, I was destroying...I was creating a hero on the thing.

667
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,990
I was like...what?

668
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,650
It was making those blue.

669
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,280
I get it.

670
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,460
I got it.

671
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,060
I can't see anything.

672
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,860
What could be in this room?

673
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,240
A door.

674
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,440
What's over here?

675
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,600
Money?

676
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,760
No.

677
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,940
What's this?

678
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,480
Oh.

679
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,810
I already beat it, but I also got confused.

680
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,510
Don't get confused!

681
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,130
Blorp!

682
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,410
This looks like a trap.

683
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,550
Are

684
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,430
you gonna move or do anything?

685
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,600
Yeah, I'll try using my sword.

686
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Look, it's working!

687
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,260
Don't worry.

688
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,560
He's...

689
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,400
Oh, he has his legs.

690
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,480
Is he still alive or...

691
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,200
I think he's dead.

692
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:35,880
Oh, thanks.

693
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,460
He even had a health bar.

694
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,560
Wow.

695
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,040
He just took it.

696
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:53,660
What a man.

697
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,160
Oh my god.

698
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,560
I'm trying to...I'm trying to...

699
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,000
Nice!

700
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,520
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

701
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,200
I'm using my sword, everybody!

702
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,380
OK, nevermind.

703
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:06,940
I'll go back.

704
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:13,010
Nice.

705
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,590
So it's kind of worth falling down these.

706
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:19,570
Just because it might be a pleasant surprise.

707
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,150
Or a stinky surprise.

708
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,630
You never know, unless you try it out.

709
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:28,070
Now you can see why the game is the way that it is.

710
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:29,570
Nah.

711
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:43,070
Oh my gosh, if I had gone here first I would have locked myself out of that riveting...

712
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,590
Where is he?

713
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,110
Oh, it's a bunch of bats!

714
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:58,610
I would have locked myself out of that riveting mini-boss.

715
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,670
That would have been so sad.

716
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:15,140
And I open up another path.

717
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,480
There is nothing in here?

718
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,000
OK.

719
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,600
Run Dante, run!

720
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:32,840
I guess this way.

721
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,220
Wait, where is your roar?

722
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,860
Oh my goodness.

723
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,700
Ah!

724
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,140
I'm being surrounded.

725
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,840
Give me your money.

726
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,180
Where is the other guy?

727
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,460
Oh, they all have health.

728
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:54,800
I'm just stupid I think.

729
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,260
I think I just never noticed.

730
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,900
There it goes.

731
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:03,650
Give me your money.

732
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:08,640
Where is he?

733
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,560
Is he in there?

734
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,520
Are you in there?

735
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,940
Where is he?

736
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:22,500
Oh, there he is.

737
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,780
What's down here?

738
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
I love the savage golems.

739
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,650
At least the other one is moving.

740
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:41,270
Oh my god.

741
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:44,090
I can't.

742
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,790
I can't with this.

743
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,630
Oh my god.

744
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:51,350
He like even attempted an attack before.

745
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:52,930
OK, hold on.

746
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:53,690
Turbo!

747
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,400
He tried.

748
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,040
Oh my god.

749
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,660
Oh, they regenerate.

750
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,580
Oh, interesting.

751
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,640
Let's kill this guy off first then.

752
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,980
Kill him, kill him dead.

753
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,230
OK.

754
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:18,470
Where is he going?

755
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:20,510
Oh my god, this is so sad.

756
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,140
Something hurt me, I think.

757
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,660
I actually can't tell.

758
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:32,780
I wasn't looking at the screen.

759
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:41,330
He starts to crawl.

760
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,010
For real.

761
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,810
That wasn't worth my time, I think.

762
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:49,790
That was...

763
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:51,910
Yeah, I felt like I was bullying those guys.

764
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:54,050
They're tanks, but...

765
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,390
They're just really silly.

766
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,150
A lot, a lot, a lot, a lot.

767
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,510
Oh, no, no, no.

768
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:08,430
Dante, Dante, turn around.

769
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,110
There you go.

770
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:14,070
Is this how meet and greets will be like from now on?

771
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:14,610
What?

772
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:16,970
What do you mean by that?

773
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:30,060
We run to the door.

774
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:30,920
Oh!

775
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,320
A time.

776
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,460
How much roar do I have?

777
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:39,880
3000.

778
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,940
The path is long.

779
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,040
The road is tough.

780
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:51,510
Where were you?

781
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,350
I meant to make Savage Golem cry.

782
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:57,210
Oh my god.

783
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,330
The door tried to get me.

784
00:47:59,330 --> 00:47:59,730
Hey, guys.

785
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:00,810
Oh my gosh.

786
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,430
That was close.

787
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,790
That was also close.

788
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,150
I'm not hitting anything.

789
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:19,110
Get out, Dante!

790
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:20,110
Get out, Dante!

791
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,210
You're crazy!

792
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,130
You're maniacs!

793
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,650
Dante, please shoot any of them.

794
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:29,610
Please.

795
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:30,890
Dante, Dante, shoot.

796
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,950
Like, aim Dante!

797
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,510
Aim Dante!

798
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:35,970
Aim Dante!

799
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,910
Oh my god, there's more of them.

800
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,150
Oh, no, these are the pyromancers.

801
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:47,350
They seem...

802
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,530
I can't tell if they're...

803
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:52,130
Did that reach me or...

804
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:53,870
I can't tell.

805
00:48:53,870 --> 00:48:55,330
There he goes.

806
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,590
Okay, there he goes.

807
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:57,970
See you later!

808
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:00,210
We did it.

809
00:49:01,630 --> 00:49:03,230
Oh, I should have Devil Triggered.

810
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,310
I keep forgetting that this is...

811
00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:06,290
Well, now I can.

812
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,300
Easy.

813
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:28,780
No way!

814
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,980
I got a girl!

815
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:39,370
Amazing.

816
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,790
Did I lose all... What is this?

817
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:48,690
It refilled my Devil Trigger?

818
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:51,150
Oh my god.

819
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:53,610
Let's go.

820
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:56,730
Thanks for the Super Chat!

821
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:00,250
Let's go.

822
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,490
Eh, start blasting.

823
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,120
Capcom greenlit the sequel before the first game came out.

824
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:16,960
Aerial heart.

825
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,920
A magic stone with the heart of a flying demon bird.

826
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,060
Does that mean I can fly now?

827
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,840
And Devil Trigger.

828
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,420
That's why they let me replenish.

829
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:49,940
Take that.

830
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:50,940
Get those.

831
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:53,060
Wait, where are they?

832
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:53,920
Oh, they're higher up?

833
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:54,920
Am I stupid?

834
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,320
Grab the orbs.

835
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:58,740
My depth perception.

836
00:50:59,020 --> 00:50:59,600
Where are they?

837
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,840
Grab the orbs.

838
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,960
Grab the orb!

839
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,840
Where is it?

840
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,120
OK, I got it.

841
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,600
Alright, we're gonna replenish...

842
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,680
and then we'll just fly up.

843
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,220
Easy.

844
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:25,070
Got it.

845
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:27,110
Oh my god, mission clear!

846
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:29,950
Rank C.

847
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:31,650
For C, I did it.

848
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:32,890
Mickey.

849
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,090
Alright baby.

850
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:42,170
Nice.

851
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:43,190
Next mission.

852
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:45,550
C for gun.

853
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,270
Oh my god.

854
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,390
The key to the next journey begins and ends with death.

855
00:51:57,660 --> 00:51:59,500
Wait, what happened to my Devil Trigger?

856
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,240
It completely depleted.

857
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:02,580
What?

858
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:03,840
No!

859
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:06,750
That's unfair.

860
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:08,150
No!

861
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,470
It got stolen from me.

862
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:15,090
Looks like we're in London.

863
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:18,670
Stanky.

864
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,210
London's got orbs.

865
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,030
London's got orbs.

866
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,170
What's going on?

867
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,020
Where is the goatling?

868
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,700
Oh shit.

869
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:48,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

870
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,740
Roll!

871
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:50,780
Dante, roll!

872
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:51,440
Roll Dante!

873
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:58,960
Keep going!

874
00:52:59,340 --> 00:52:59,720
Dante!

875
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,260
We're not there yet!

876
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,040
My Devil Trigger is all gone!

877
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:06,100
Otherwise I would have...

878
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:11,730
Now I'm close enough?

879
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:13,690
Oh my god.

880
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:17,390
He's right there!

881
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:35,610
Oh there we go, there we go, there we go.

882
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:38,410
I

883
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:44,570
don't want him to do anymore of the...

884
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:45,410
There we go, there we go.

885
00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:46,110
Nice, nice, nice.

886
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:47,470
No, no, no.

887
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:49,270
Focus on him, focus on him, focus on him.

888
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,070
Focus on him, focus on him.

889
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,720
Such engaging gameplay, yeah?

890
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,700
You guys are entertained or you're not entertained?

891
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,720
Oh my god, it's this stuff again.

892
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,140
Can you like leave me alone?

893
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,720
You, right there.

894
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:11,740
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

895
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,260
Oh my god.

896
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,080
Stop summoning guys, please.

897
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:19,760
I'm stuck in here.

898
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,560
I like how he stopped drops and rolls, for real.

899
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,760
Please, calling.

900
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,400
Calling, take my hits.

901
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,960
Eat my bullets.

902
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,000
Please.

903
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:42,900
You do be spamming the flame.

904
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,620
Oh my god.

905
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:47,960
He's dead!

906
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:51,980
Give me your money.

907
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,020
Money.

908
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,220
They're like, hey, you wanna spend those buckaroos?

909
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,760
No, I'm saving up for the big boys.

910
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,100
Where'd the rest of the money go?

911
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:09,600
I saw it, I saw it on the street lamps.

912
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,420
Game, you didn't rob me, did you now?

913
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,580
This place is too clean to be London.

914
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,340
Oh, here we go, here we go.

915
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:21,100
Every orb.

916
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,820
What about on the other sides?

917
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,340
We have that door there.

918
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,140
Were there any other sides?

919
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:34,020
I don't think this looks very clean.

920
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:40,300
I don't know what you're used to, but I don't think this looks very...

921
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,600
Well, I guess there's not, like, litter everywhere.

922
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,820
What the?

923
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,520
Cool.

924
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,630
Leave me alone!

925
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:57,910
Go into the air.

926
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,950
There he goes, flying upwards.

927
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,830
There he goes, flying upwards.

928
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,350
There he goes.

929
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,390
There he goes.

930
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:12,530
There he goes, into the air.

931
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,210
There he goes.

932
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:16,550
Off to heaven.

933
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:19,670
Give me my money.

934
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,410
There he goes.

935
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,650
Oh my god, my ROARBS!

936
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,710
You made me miss them!

937
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,940
How do I use the stinger again?

938
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,700
I don't remember.

939
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,560
You thought I wouldn't check for a ROARB, huh?

940
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,340
What the?

941
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,560
That was the final boss?

942
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,860
Was it really?

943
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:23,940
I need more

944
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:27,640
ROARBS.

945
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,060
I'm a poor, poor guy.

946
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:32,760
I'm poor.

947
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,980
I need ROARBS.

948
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,880
I'm poor.

949
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,140
I need ROARBS.

950
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,680
Thank you very much.

951
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,750
I'm poor for ROARBS.

952
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:47,690
It's okay, he'll never touch me.

953
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:49,330
He's going to space.

954
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:52,670
What's that?

955
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:55,270
What's that, like...

956
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:56,170
You know the song.

957
00:57:58,730 --> 00:57:59,870
Space song.

958
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,730
And this is why we explore.

959
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:03,930
For the BLORBS.

960
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:06,450
Double BLORB?

961
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:08,110
Oh no, I got a single BLORB.

962
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:08,590
Let's go.

963
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:13,530
Use sword for more ROARBS.

964
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:13,930
Really?

965
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,010
It'll give me more?

966
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:17,090
Okay.

967
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:19,870
Ducktales moon theme.

968
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:23,810
Ducktales.

969
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,650
I'm still too poor.

970
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:41,730
I'm poor.

971
00:58:46,170 --> 00:58:49,650
Did the Ducktales game ever, like...

972
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:52,110
What?

973
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:52,550
That

974
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,550
was supposed to be mine!

975
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:03,610
But didn't it, like...

976
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:08,670
It, like, was stuck on a certain... like on Xbox or something and then...

977
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,240
Oh.

978
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:16,040
That's a bigger monkey.

979
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:42,720
I'm shooting him!

980
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,120
Oh my gosh.

981
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,100
Hey, don't come towards me.

982
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,020
Jump, jump, jump!

983
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:57,310
Oh, you can just hold the button and DT?

984
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,130
Oh no way.

985
00:59:58,530 --> 00:59:59,190
Okay, good to know.

986
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,800
I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting.

987
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,860
I don't know where I am.

988
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,440
I'm stuck in the void.

989
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:22,740
Oh my god.

990
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,700
There's other monkeys too.

991
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,420
Here, I'm gonna try.

992
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,740
Oh my gosh.

993
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:28,580
No, no, no, no.

994
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,060
Focus on that.

995
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:29,620
Focus on him.

996
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:37,590
Oh, there's just random monkeys everywhere.

997
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:38,250
Oh my god.

998
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:39,590
He's almost dead.

999
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:43,350
Random monkeys, random monkeys.

1000
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,730
Oh shoot.

1001
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:46,070
Where am I?

1002
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:47,870
Oh, I'm close, I'm close.

1003
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,200
We're killing him, we're killing him.

1004
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,380
Where is he going?

1005
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,620
Where the hell is he going?

1006
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,260
Oh, he's coming towards me.

1007
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,060
Is he summoning more?

1008
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:20,960
Ouch.

1009
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:29,340
Just shoot the monkeys.

1010
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,380
I hate that the hand is grabbing at me at the same time.

1011
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,060
It's so messed up.

1012
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,180
What am I shooting at?

1013
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:42,360
What am I even... I'm not even getting him.

1014
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:42,900
What am I doing?

1015
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,060
And he's dead.

1016
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:51,420
Easy.

1017
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,460
The doors literally... I'm catching strays from the door.

1018
01:01:57,740 --> 01:01:58,340
Huge gate.

1019
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,560
Oh, a key to unlock a huge gate blocking a passage from the station to the harbor.

1020
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,020
And then there were grorbs in the corner.

1021
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:06,000
Wait, those are still there, right?

1022
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,990
Thank you for the five gifted.

1023
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:15,810
Thank you.

1024
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:17,630
Yummy.

1025
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:20,430
Monkey down.

1026
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:25,890
I guess I don't really need it, but...

1027
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,250
Oh, it gives me grorbs.

1028
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,730
Five thousand grorbs.

1029
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,210
So this one?

1030
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:38,310
I would like one ticket to the east side, please.

1031
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,390
What gate?

1032
01:02:44,250 --> 01:02:45,430
What is this to?

1033
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,090
This one?

1034
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:49,970
Oh, a key.

1035
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:52,430
Oh my god!

1036
01:02:52,470 --> 01:02:53,090
We got it back!

1037
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:56,330
Let's go to the other big gate.

1038
01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:04,690
Alright, we are half way to upgrade our guns.

1039
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:07,610
What the hell is this?

1040
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:09,850
Oh my god!

1041
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:10,810
Oh my god.

1042
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,270
There's things every...

1043
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:19,410
God, I hate the ones that throw the stuff.

1044
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,970
Gosh, at this rate I'm never gonna get...

1045
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,930
I'm never gonna get these grorbs.

1046
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:32,930
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1047
01:03:34,330 --> 01:03:39,600
I'm gonna get the grorbs that people are dropping right now.

1048
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,360
Oh, this guy is like right in front of me.

1049
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,300
Please die!

1050
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,640
You guys suck.

1051
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:49,720
Grorb!

1052
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:55,260
The wheelskeletons, yeah, they suck so much.

1053
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,660
So leave me alone!

1054
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,010
There he goes.

1055
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:05,830
I'm gonna collect my money and you're gonna go to space.

1056
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,710
And that's just how this works out.

1057
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,210
And I get the other grorb.

1058
01:04:10,450 --> 01:04:10,770
Perfect.

1059
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:13,690
I hate wheelskeletons.

1060
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:14,610
I hate those guys.

1061
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:16,710
Oh, there's more of them.

1062
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:25,050
Be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be-be...

1063
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,010
Who's behind me?

1064
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:27,890
Oh my god!

1065
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:30,930
More birdies?

1066
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:35,530
They're not doing much.

1067
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:38,970
OK.

1068
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:43,910
Oh my god, they're never... Never ending!

1069
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,290
I don't mind these guys so much.

1070
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:49,930
There he goes.

1071
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:51,990
To become one with the birds.

1072
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,790
It's like my birdie waifu is up there.

1073
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:03,390
Now we just shoot the... The feather is dropping.

1074
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:09,050
It's so sad.

1075
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:13,050
Wait, isn't this the bad one?

1076
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:14,400
There's never such thing...

1077
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:15,960
As the bad.

1078
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,470
Can I just leave?

1079
01:05:22,610 --> 01:05:23,450
Is this not the door?

1080
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:24,970
Oh my god.

1081
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,090
Which one is the door?

1082
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:33,770
I assume I mentioned it earlier, OG DuckTales and DuckTales Remastered are both on Steam.

1083
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:34,710
Oh, really?

1084
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,750
So it did get released.

1085
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:40,490
It got... Ouch!

1086
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:41,190
Oh my god.

1087
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:49,250
DT?

1088
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:50,190
Yeah, you're right.

1089
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:52,950
You're right.

1090
01:05:55,730 --> 01:05:56,590
You're right.

1091
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:59,350
You're right.

1092
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:02,970
You're right.

1093
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:04,510
You're right.

1094
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:10,720
Who else is... Oh my god.

1095
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,760
Where's the door that I need to go to?

1096
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,580
I just got the key!

1097
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,160
Look at their flopping bodies.

1098
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,920
This is so sad.

1099
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,050
Ouchie ouch.

1100
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:33,210
Why did I even try?

1101
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,010
What is this?

1102
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:42,590
This is sad!

1103
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:45,690
I'm gonna leave.

1104
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:47,750
I showed you in the cutscene.

1105
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,650
I didn't see it!

1106
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:51,310
Where was it?

1107
01:06:51,730 --> 01:06:52,970
I didn't see it.

1108
01:06:53,690 --> 01:06:54,410
Oh my god.

1109
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,870
I'm going back.

1110
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,190
Wait, what?

1111
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:01,970
Next to the boss door?

1112
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,760
Oh my god, this one?

1113
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,700
Oh, I thought that was inside the room.

1114
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:14,420
Wait, no.

1115
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,720
This one.

1116
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:21,130
I'm styling.

1117
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:23,670
I missed it.

1118
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,360
Yeah, see?

1119
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,140
This is what I came through.

1120
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,670
The one with the light.

1121
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,210
There was one with the light.

1122
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,690
Fancy angel doors.

1123
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,580
Oh my god.

1124
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:07,670
It's okay, we were grinding.

1125
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:10,950
For lots of money.

1126
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,700
Yeah, we farmed the rorbs.

1127
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:20,700
We are so close now, actually.

1128
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:20,800
Actually.

1129
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:26,480
She has many arms, but only one heart.

1130
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,680
As she waits for the hunter deep in the water.

1131
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,700
I don't know what that means, but...

1132
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,160
I wanna meet her.

1133
01:08:40,450 --> 01:08:41,090
Okay.

1134
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:49,250
Please.

1135
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,680
Don't do it.

1136
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,840
Let's... Okay.

1137
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,020
Alright.

1138
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:01,100
Okay.

1139
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,160
No.

1140
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:04,480
This way.

1141
01:09:05,820 --> 01:09:08,030
Oh my god.

1142
01:09:19,840 --> 01:09:20,400
Rorbs!

1143
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,080
Yo, that was incredible.

1144
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,000
That felt so good.

1145
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,500
That was the best feeling thing that we've experienced so far.

1146
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:32,440
Come on monkeys.

1147
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:33,700
There he goes.

1148
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,880
Up to the sky, little monkey.

1149
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:48,500
Oh my goodness.

1150
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,580
Where did you come from?

1151
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:51,560
Rorb!

1152
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:56,660
Excuse me.

1153
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:57,560
Excuse me.

1154
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:01,720
Wait, how do I get that?

1155
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,540
Oh yeah!

1156
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:26,430
I think I won.

1157
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:27,890
God.

1158
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:36,670
So far, my honest opinion.

1159
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:40,190
I understand what people complain about.

1160
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:43,730
But, I'm still having a good time.

1161
01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:48,330
Nevermind.

1162
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:49,210
This game sucks.

1163
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:52,910
Far, far away.

1164
01:10:53,790 --> 01:10:55,390
The Rorb world.

1165
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:56,630
Oh, more of them?

1166
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:01,910
Are the others gonna notice?

1167
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,630
That their friend is going into space?

1168
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,230
Oh my goodness.

1169
01:11:08,650 --> 01:11:10,430
They're just dropping like flies here.

1170
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,610
Wait, how do I stinger again?

1171
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:15,830
Don't worry.

1172
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:17,510
Don't worry.

1173
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:18,450
Don't worry.

1174
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:19,670
Come on!

1175
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,230
Come on!

1176
01:11:21,230 --> 01:11:21,390
Come on!

1177
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,640
The stinger is so depressing.

1178
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,240
I don't even hit them.

1179
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:34,600
Hold on.

1180
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:35,220
Let me get my money.

1181
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:43,450
Alright.

1182
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:44,710
Knock it off, buddy.

1183
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:46,750
The limp stinger.

1184
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:48,270
Let me get my money.

1185
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:55,360
Oh, lots of money.

1186
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,420
Oh my god.

1187
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:58,780
These guys just don't stop coming.

1188
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:03,120
There he goes.

1189
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,220
There he goes.

1190
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,260
Oh, that guy is dead too.

1191
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,930
So, is there a reason why Dante doesn't talk a lot?

1192
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:21,870
Or is it just...

1193
01:12:26,210 --> 01:12:29,670
Were they just like, this guy is suddenly our silent protagonist?

1194
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,270
He forgot how to speak?

1195
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:36,210
Dante!

1196
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,950
It's just a pile of wood.

1197
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,170
It's just a pile of wood.

1198
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,230
He talks a lot in 3 and later games.

1199
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:54,870
Do we get any... Where is his witty one-liners, you know?

1200
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:57,030
Wow.

1201
01:12:59,230 --> 01:12:59,830
Wow.

1202
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:12,950
Holy moly.

1203
01:13:13,050 --> 01:13:14,610
Guys, we are so close.

1204
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,890
We are actually so close.

1205
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:20,310
Oh my god.

1206
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:22,070
This is it.

1207
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:24,710
Don't fall off, Dante.

1208
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:25,090
Please.

1209
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:27,910
Oh my god.

1210
01:13:27,990 --> 01:13:29,030
We are gonna get the 10,000.

1211
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,410
Please.

1212
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,310
So close.

1213
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:37,770
The sound of gunshots caused some short-term hearing loss.

1214
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,050
I believe that.

1215
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:49,810
I really like the atmosphere though.

1216
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,310
I'll give them that.

1217
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:53,790
I really like the...

1218
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:57,430
The locations and stuff.

1219
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:57,970
It's fun.

1220
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,730
His outfit is pink too.

1221
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:02,690
Yeah, exactly.

1222
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,030
Oh, okay.

1223
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,370
Nevermind.

1224
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:07,990
Set design is cool.

1225
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,290
Yeah.

1226
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,630
Very cool.

1227
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:16,960
Grab those.

1228
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:17,400
No.

1229
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,280
I said those.

1230
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:19,860
There we go.

1231
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:21,340
Oh my gosh.

1232
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:21,920
Lighthouse.

1233
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:25,720
What is this?

1234
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:35,470
How was it done?

1235
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,390
Hold on.

1236
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,590
There is more for me to see.

1237
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:45,450
One second.

1238
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,690
The red cotton did it.

1239
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:57,970
I can hear.

1240
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:00,850
Oh.

1241
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:01,430
Wait.

1242
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,150
Can I... Maybe I jump over?

1243
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:04,330
No?

1244
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:07,770
How

1245
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,990
do I get over there though?

1246
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:15,750
Maybe when I come back?

1247
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:16,330
Let's see.

1248
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,030
You need DT?

1249
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,730
No way.

1250
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:24,470
Do you think it's worth it?

1251
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,050
Oh my god.

1252
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,850
I messed it up, I think.

1253
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:36,170
I think I need to go from this side.

1254
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:37,810
Okay, hold on.

1255
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:41,810
Why is there an invisible wall?

1256
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:44,450
Oh my god.

1257
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:44,990
Nevermind.

1258
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:45,630
I give up.

1259
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:47,870
I give up.

1260
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,430
I give up.

1261
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:48,970
I give up.

1262
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:50,270
It's so messed up.

1263
01:15:55,680 --> 01:15:57,100
What is this thing though?

1264
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:00,520
Oh, I did it.

1265
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:41,990
Is this faster I wonder?

1266
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:43,010
Let's try.

1267
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:45,470
Okay, okay, okay.

1268
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:46,110
Stop!

1269
01:16:46,510 --> 01:16:46,830
Stop!

1270
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:48,190
I don't need to see the cutscene!

1271
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,390
I need to run!

1272
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:53,940
Oh my god.

1273
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:54,340
Oh my god.

1274
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:54,560
Dante.

1275
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:55,640
We are not gonna make it.

1276
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:56,240
We are not gonna make it.

1277
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:56,980
We are not gonna make it.

1278
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,100
We are not gonna make it.

1279
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:06,400
Dante, you can crawl through there.

1280
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,320
I need DT sprint.

1281
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:16,600
Yeah, but I already wasted it earlier so I don't wanna waste it now.

1282
01:17:19,540 --> 01:17:20,620
Okay, I give up.

1283
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:25,850
I give up.

1284
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,310
Okay, anyway.

1285
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,560
It's just these guys.

1286
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:42,540
I guess we'll get more DT here.

1287
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:46,980
Just gonna keep going and...

1288
01:17:50,140 --> 01:17:51,060
Keep going.

1289
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:52,780
There he goes up into space.

1290
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,620
This guy over here is lazy.

1291
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,280
Literal lazy bones not doing anything.

1292
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,660
He's like, I just wanna fly man.

1293
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:05,560
I don't wanna do anything.

1294
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:07,920
Just send me to space already.

1295
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,800
Oh, I'm getting two for the price of one!

1296
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,580
I might be so good at this game I think.

1297
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:19,140
I might be so good at this game.

1298
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:31,850
She's a pro.

1299
01:18:32,850 --> 01:18:35,870
That's what we call speedrun strategies.

1300
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:37,950
What is this?

1301
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:50,600
This is gonna happen every time?

1302
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,840
Oh wait, now we have the power of...

1303
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:55,900
What?

1304
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,680
What do we have?

1305
01:18:58,480 --> 01:18:59,220
Quick heart.

1306
01:18:59,540 --> 01:19:02,880
A magic stone with the heart of a running demon beast.

1307
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,060
That's what it wants me to do.

1308
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:07,900
I got it.

1309
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:08,520
Wait, hello?

1310
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:09,560
Talk to this.

1311
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,520
300?

1312
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,780
Guys were so close.

1313
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:17,880
Now you can run to the door.

1314
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,680
Yeah, exactly.

1315
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:28,850
Is anyone gonna come up here?

1316
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,090
Probably not, right?

1317
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:32,130
Wait,

1318
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:36,640
I'm not hitting him.

1319
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:38,340
Come on, aim Dante!

1320
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,840
Dante, he's right there.

1321
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,400
Where are the other guys?

1322
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,320
Where did their money go?

1323
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:49,640
Oh, I saw it.

1324
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:58,750
Where are you?

1325
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,140
Come here.

1326
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,220
Please play DMC2!

1327
01:20:16,620 --> 01:20:18,340
It's the best game!

1328
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:20,980
Please, please, please!

1329
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:25,900
Nice.

1330
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,190
Stop, please!

1331
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:38,250
Stop!

1332
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,410
Am I really fast now?

1333
01:20:42,570 --> 01:20:43,690
I don't feel so fast.

1334
01:20:44,010 --> 01:20:44,970
I feel average.

1335
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:47,950
Oh my God!

1336
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:08,440
Did you equip the stone?

1337
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,300
There is a stone I have to equip?

1338
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:14,640
Well, I didn't know that.

1339
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:20,060
Oh wait, quick cart.

1340
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,940
I think I auto equipped.

1341
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:28,960
Yeah, I think so too.

1342
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:29,920
Because it was there.

1343
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:33,120
Hold on.

1344
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:35,820
I'm gonna fight more bozos in here.

1345
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:45,800
I'm gonna just fight more bozos in here.

1346
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:49,100
Once our devil tricker is higher.

1347
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:54,360
Honestly, I feel like we could farm these guys for like a minute.

1348
01:21:56,680 --> 01:22:01,020
And get enough money to upgrade the guns.

1349
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,080
I'm not gonna lie.

1350
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,260
I feel like maybe...It's

1351
01:22:10,030 --> 01:22:11,870
less than 200, but we are so close.

1352
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:26,540
See?

1353
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,960
It might take a second, but...

1354
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:34,140
Oh my God, we are so close.

1355
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,520
We are so close!

1356
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:40,540
I'm just 101 dalmatians left!

1357
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:43,140
Call me Cruella de Vil!

1358
01:22:43,940 --> 01:22:46,440
I'm hungry for money and puppies!

1359
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,320
Isn't there a rorb in the room?

1360
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:52,860
Is there?

1361
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:54,740
No!

1362
01:22:58,620 --> 01:23:01,260
You can almost taste the upgrade.

1363
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:01,840
I know!

1364
01:23:03,230 --> 01:23:03,580
Sweet!

1365
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:07,740
Sweet enemies!

1366
01:23:08,180 --> 01:23:08,700
Come here!

1367
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,380
Oh, I was angled to get them both at the same time.

1368
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:23,320
I lost the angle.

1369
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:26,660
Dante is clocked into a 9 to 5.

1370
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,680
What are you talking about?

1371
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,350
I'm locked in now.

1372
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:38,590
Don't even think about using turbo.

1373
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:42,490
I'm using turbo!

1374
01:23:43,450 --> 01:23:46,650
I trained in Metal Gear for this moment.

1375
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:58,630
50!

1376
01:23:59,330 --> 01:23:59,970
50!

1377
01:24:00,170 --> 01:24:00,590
50!

1378
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:01,350
50!

1379
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:02,850
51 actually.

1380
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,080
Baby, it feels so good!

1381
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,600
Oh my God, we made it.

1382
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,240
We made it!

1383
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:33,540
Alright.

1384
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,500
Alright.

1385
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:37,800
Alright.

1386
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:43,400
I wish I could stop this from happening.

1387
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,840
The cutscene, I mean.

1388
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:46,280
Run!

1389
01:24:52,310 --> 01:24:53,550
Oh my God.

1390
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,310
Yes!

1391
01:24:59,780 --> 01:25:01,300
More money.

1392
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:04,300
Alright!

1393
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,220
We did it, baby!

1394
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:08,440
Oh, hello?

1395
01:25:09,020 --> 01:25:10,680
I don't know how to use stairs anymore.

1396
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,640
That's it?

1397
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:13,340
Alright.

1398
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,580
I like it though.

1399
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:17,540
Okay.

1400
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,720
Let's go inside!

1401
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:22,940
Clutch roll.

1402
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:23,620
I know!

1403
01:25:27,380 --> 01:25:29,560
Is that the madam with many legs?

1404
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:30,540
Oh my gosh.

1405
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,070
Is she healing?

1406
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:41,210
Okay, hold on.

1407
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:42,370
That's not good.

1408
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:49,510
Guys, I think I'm an idiot.

1409
01:25:56,630 --> 01:25:59,390
Guys, I was looking at my own health.

1410
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:11,310
I keep rolling.

1411
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:12,250
I just roll.

1412
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:12,310
Hello?

1413
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:18,870
Am I even hitting her?

1414
01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:25,570
Oh, I am.

1415
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:28,050
Okay, I see.

1416
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:28,350
I see.

1417
01:26:28,430 --> 01:26:28,670
I see.

1418
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:29,850
Oh my gosh.

1419
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:32,590
I killed a thing.

1420
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:35,450
Oh no, a new one forms though.

1421
01:26:36,670 --> 01:26:37,390
Oh, I see.

1422
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:37,630
I see.

1423
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:37,930
I see.

1424
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:38,290
I see.

1425
01:26:38,390 --> 01:26:38,490
I see.

1426
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:44,610
What the hell?

1427
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,200
Stop just... Hold on.

1428
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:52,760
I guess I'll get my...

1429
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:56,240
My what's it called?

1430
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,060
Tentacles do not count on damage.

1431
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,120
Yeah, I noticed that.

1432
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:02,120
We did such good damage to her before.

1433
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:03,700
There we go.

1434
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:08,930
Ouch.

1435
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:09,390
Ouchy ouch.

1436
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:13,110
No, get her!

1437
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,830
At least we got a little bit in.

1438
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:26,870
Ouch.

1439
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:29,930
Warp?

1440
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:32,930
Oh my god, please.

1441
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:34,530
Don't take it up.

1442
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,370
I like getting the corner guy.

1443
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:42,070
Like this one.

1444
01:27:43,550 --> 01:27:47,850
But then I only have to deal with one guy rather than so many guys.

1445
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:48,730
Oh, never mind.

1446
01:27:48,790 --> 01:27:49,150
He's back.

1447
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:51,230
Oh my god.

1448
01:27:51,370 --> 01:27:51,750
Oh my god.

1449
01:27:51,890 --> 01:27:52,270
Oh my god.

1450
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:54,610
Oh my god, please.

1451
01:27:54,810 --> 01:27:55,430
Oh, I'm trapped.

1452
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:55,850
Never mind.

1453
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:57,110
I don't like being in the corner.

1454
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:02,030
Oh, I thought I was in the air.

1455
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,810
This damn camera angle, I swear.

1456
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:07,830
There we go.

1457
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:11,610
No, get her!

1458
01:28:11,770 --> 01:28:12,250
Get her!

1459
01:28:14,510 --> 01:28:14,830
Get...

1460
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:16,750
Get her!

1461
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:38,620
I feel like I'm not gonna win this one.

1462
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:39,380
Oh my gosh.

1463
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:40,900
I feel like I'm gonna have to do this one again.

1464
01:28:41,960 --> 01:28:42,280
No.

1465
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:47,390
Oh my god, and I even jumped and I didn't even know anything.

1466
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:55,440
I went to the main bar of health.

1467
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:57,020
Guys, this is so bad.

1468
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,920
I think you can manually change targets.

1469
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:05,300
I have not figured out a way if you can.

1470
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,220
Oh my gosh, please.

1471
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,680
Oh my gosh.

1472
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:18,860
And then you can't see where the tentacle is when you're up in the air.

1473
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,660
This sucks.

1474
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,180
This fight actually sucks so much.

1475
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:31,000
L3?

1476
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,800
No.

1477
01:29:33,080 --> 01:29:33,300
Wait.

1478
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:33,680
No.

1479
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:34,600
I'm pressing L3.

1480
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,320
It's not working.

1481
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:47,450
Just figured what out now.

1482
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:49,950
What?

1483
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:52,130
The thing that someone told me and that doesn't work?

1484
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:54,250
That thing?

1485
01:30:05,950 --> 01:30:08,030
The boss is defeated by sword?

1486
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:09,410
Are you sure?

1487
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,790
Oh, I tried sword and it just pushed me out.

1488
01:30:12,170 --> 01:30:12,610
And I died.

1489
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:15,090
Oh, I'm not dead!

1490
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,520
Please die, tentacle!

1491
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:34,400
Oh my gosh, every time I think it's gonna die.

1492
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:38,200
And it deals big ol' damage.

1493
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,320
Sucks.

1494
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:41,700
Please.

1495
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:42,500
There we go.

1496
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:42,800
Okay.

1497
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:51,560
No!

1498
01:30:51,740 --> 01:30:52,120
No!

1499
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:52,620
No!

1500
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:53,120
Go for her!

1501
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:19,270
I can't even get to her when I do the sword though.

1502
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:21,830
I can't even get to her when I do the sword.

1503
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:24,150
Oh my gosh, please.

1504
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:26,190
I can't see where I am.

1505
01:31:29,870 --> 01:31:30,910
Oh my gosh, please.

1506
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:11,270
She became a bubble.

1507
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:14,990
Ouch, ouch.

1508
01:32:15,810 --> 01:32:16,190
Please.

1509
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,590
Is there a grorb anywhere?

1510
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:22,290
Is there a grorb anywhere?

1511
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:25,810
Oh my gosh.

1512
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,390
No, please don't take it out.

1513
01:32:29,930 --> 01:32:30,590
Oh my gosh.

1514
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:57,620
Oh my gosh, please, please, please.

1515
01:33:09,930 --> 01:33:11,570
Don't stop jumping Dante!

1516
01:33:13,310 --> 01:33:13,850
What the?

1517
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,700
Oh my gosh, a warb.

1518
01:33:43,140 --> 01:33:43,940
Elusive warb.

1519
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:46,500
Guys, I feel like I'm gonna die though.

1520
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:47,800
For real.

1521
01:33:52,270 --> 01:33:53,250
I'll try with the sword.

1522
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:56,070
See, every time I try with the sword I literally get hit.

1523
01:33:56,070 --> 01:33:57,410
Every time!

1524
01:33:57,950 --> 01:33:58,910
Every time!

1525
01:33:59,350 --> 01:34:01,310
I try with the sword, he takes me down.

1526
01:34:04,270 --> 01:34:05,190
Every time.

1527
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:10,110
I know the tentacles respawn.

1528
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:10,770
I'm not dumb.

1529
01:34:11,150 --> 01:34:14,130
Why do you think I've been fighting the same tentacle over and over again?

1530
01:34:15,110 --> 01:34:15,870
Oh my gosh.

1531
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:21,550
Oh shit.

1532
01:34:23,870 --> 01:34:24,370
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1533
01:34:29,410 --> 01:34:30,970
Oh my god, this is so...

1534
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,360
At least we're farming DT now.

1535
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:40,920
Farm the DT.

1536
01:34:41,220 --> 01:34:41,600
Oh my gosh.

1537
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,240
That was close.

1538
01:34:44,900 --> 01:34:46,760
I thought this was supposed to be a sexy lady.

1539
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,340
I mean, she is kind of sexy, but like...

1540
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:02,960
Okay.

1541
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:04,260
Alright.

1542
01:35:05,260 --> 01:35:05,740
Alright.

1543
01:35:06,680 --> 01:35:07,220
Alright.

1544
01:35:07,220 --> 01:35:07,420
Alright.

1545
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:10,860
Slowly but surely, guys.

1546
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:15,360
Okay.

1547
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:23,740
Okay, there we go.

1548
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,980
Back to our weekly scheduled programming while I farm more DT.

1549
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:36,170
I don't even know where the hell I am.

1550
01:35:36,650 --> 01:35:37,570
I'm in the sky.

1551
01:35:38,890 --> 01:35:40,090
I'm in the sky.

1552
01:35:40,090 --> 01:35:40,190
Okay.

1553
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:43,710
Not enough.

1554
01:35:44,050 --> 01:35:44,510
Not enough.

1555
01:35:44,690 --> 01:35:45,330
Let's get some more.

1556
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:51,500
Get some more.

1557
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:52,560
Miss some more.

1558
01:35:55,200 --> 01:35:56,220
That was AFK.

1559
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:56,960
Did I miss anything?

1560
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,000
What?

1561
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,580
You don't love this riveting fight?

1562
01:36:01,660 --> 01:36:03,020
What are you talking about?

1563
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,640
This is the fight!

1564
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:13,630
No!

1565
01:36:13,870 --> 01:36:14,210
No!

1566
01:36:24,490 --> 01:36:26,790
I can actually direct onto his sword?

1567
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:27,210
Really?

1568
01:36:32,340 --> 01:36:35,440
I think I'm just gonna keep going with what I'm doing though.

1569
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,160
It's slow, but it's steady.

1570
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:38,380
It's doing the job.

1571
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:40,140
Sorry.

1572
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:42,160
I'm just gonna keep going with what I'm doing.

1573
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,640
It's working out, you know?

1574
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,100
Don't listen to backseaters.

1575
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:47,520
Okay.

1576
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,500
I'm doing what I'm doing, you know?

1577
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,800
We're just getting it done eventually.

1578
01:36:59,210 --> 01:36:59,830
Eventually.

1579
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,910
She'll die eventually.

1580
01:37:04,230 --> 01:37:05,170
I'm surprised.

1581
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:07,630
I'm surprised I'm good though.

1582
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:12,930
I just keep doing what I'm doing and then...

1583
01:37:12,930 --> 01:37:13,370
Get back.

1584
01:37:13,450 --> 01:37:14,330
Get close to her.

1585
01:37:14,570 --> 01:37:15,370
Get close to her.

1586
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:16,590
Okay, nevermind.

1587
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:21,470
Are you sure?

1588
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,330
I'm not a speedrunner.

1589
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:30,830
My methods, if they work for me, they work for me, you know?

1590
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:34,450
I don't have to listen to anybody else's rules.

1591
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:38,730
I follow my own path.

1592
01:37:48,390 --> 01:37:49,910
That was so close.

1593
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:51,230
We're so close though, guys.

1594
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,800
That was close.

1595
01:38:00,340 --> 01:38:00,860
Okay.

1596
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,500
We're farming roars.

1597
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,800
We're farming ghouls.

1598
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:08,800
Well, I wish I could change the...

1599
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:12,960
I wish I could change what I was locked onto.

1600
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:16,320
I'm trying to shoot you, lady.

1601
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:20,540
Guys, I'm just jumping in this corner.

1602
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,940
I guess I'll just keep going at whatever this is.

1603
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:42,010
R1 then L3?

1604
01:38:42,130 --> 01:38:43,430
Why is it so complicated?

1605
01:38:45,550 --> 01:38:47,210
R1 then L3.

1606
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:48,350
Oh my god, it worked.

1607
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:49,730
But I have to hold it!

1608
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:52,690
I have to hold it for it to work!

1609
01:38:53,230 --> 01:38:54,150
What the hell?

1610
01:38:54,530 --> 01:38:58,400
This is so complicated!

1611
01:39:05,390 --> 01:39:06,610
What is it attacking?

1612
01:39:07,670 --> 01:39:08,750
I can't really tell.

1613
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:10,630
How is it attacking me?

1614
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:16,050
R1 then L3.

1615
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:16,990
I'll do that in a second.

1616
01:39:16,990 --> 01:39:17,910
Okay, R1.

1617
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:24,560
We did it.

1618
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:27,820
Everybody...

1619
01:39:27,820 --> 01:39:32,900
Can I undo my DT now so that I can keep my...

1620
01:39:36,200 --> 01:39:37,160
I lost.

1621
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,620
Well, no, actually I didn't have that much.

1622
01:39:38,700 --> 01:39:39,780
Oh my gosh, finally.

1623
01:39:45,730 --> 01:39:46,690
What the...

1624
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:48,590
Where is it?

1625
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:49,630
Please!

1626
01:40:05,620 --> 01:40:07,340
Where was it?

1627
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,800
It lasted for 2 seconds!

1628
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:16,200
That's so messed up!

1629
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,060
Shotgun!

1630
01:40:21,100 --> 01:40:23,440
I think I'll just stay with Ebony and Ivory though.

1631
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,000
There we go, I'm leaving town.

1632
01:40:32,180 --> 01:40:33,620
So did you have fun?

1633
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:35,840
Nah.

1634
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:36,040
Yeah.

1635
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:39,780
What?

1636
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:02,870
That was so...

1637
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:07,190
We didn't even see him get to go over the ramp.

1638
01:41:07,470 --> 01:41:08,510
He just was driving.

1639
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:11,630
That was certainly one of the fights of all time.

1640
01:41:12,910 --> 01:41:18,550
Close to your eyes, but far off in your mind, the hunter must learn the value of options.

1641
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:21,970
What are you trying to say?

1642
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:24,030
Also, good thing that we upgraded, right?

1643
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:26,530
30...

1644
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:28,730
30,000!

1645
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:30,970
30,000!

1646
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:43,450
How do I use the shotgun?

1647
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:44,350
Do I have to equip it?

1648
01:41:50,130 --> 01:41:51,190
Oh my god.

1649
01:41:53,390 --> 01:41:54,270
LT?

1650
01:41:56,310 --> 01:41:57,870
Wait, no, that's...

1651
01:41:58,370 --> 01:41:59,150
Devil Trigger.

1652
01:42:01,710 --> 01:42:03,430
Oh, there we go.

1653
01:42:03,910 --> 01:42:04,850
Sorry, OK.

1654
01:42:06,370 --> 01:42:06,830
OK.

1655
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:08,650
Sorry, I was thinking L1.

1656
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:09,170
My bad.

1657
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:17,930
Oh my god, I sounded... Oh my god!

1658
01:42:30,930 --> 01:42:32,070
Oh my god.

1659
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,450
Freaky!

1660
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:37,510
Freaky and jerky!

1661
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:40,430
Oh, Jerry, sorry.

1662
01:42:40,550 --> 01:42:41,270
Freaky and Jerry!

1663
01:42:45,190 --> 01:42:46,150
Oh, freaky!

1664
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:49,590
Jerry's gonna die first, maybe.

1665
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:55,450
The true freaks never die!

1666
01:42:56,010 --> 01:42:57,770
True freaks never die!

1667
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:00,950
Wait, am I gonna kill Jerry?

1668
01:43:01,190 --> 01:43:02,350
Oh yeah, yeah, there he goes.

1669
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,390
But what was about the sword?

1670
01:43:08,510 --> 01:43:12,010
I thought the sword was not the thing that you play in this game.

1671
01:43:13,130 --> 01:43:13,610
Fine.

1672
01:43:16,330 --> 01:43:17,190
Oh, shoot.

1673
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:23,950
My bad, I accidentally Devil Triggered.

1674
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:26,890
Sniper wolf.

1675
01:43:27,090 --> 01:43:27,390
Wolves.

1676
01:43:30,870 --> 01:43:33,130
The true DMC2 experience is just shoot everything.

1677
01:43:33,330 --> 01:43:34,250
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1678
01:43:36,530 --> 01:43:38,130
Am I gonna have to go fight that?

1679
01:43:38,310 --> 01:43:39,950
I just fought a lady.

1680
01:43:40,270 --> 01:43:42,030
Now I'm having to fight a skele-man.

1681
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:45,750
What a... Give me a break, game.

1682
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:53,130
Those look like normal wolves, Dante.

1683
01:43:53,410 --> 01:43:55,870
No, they were Freaky and Jerry.

1684
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:58,510
Forget Tom and Jerry.

1685
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:01,430
All my homies love Freaky and Jerry.

1686
01:44:01,570 --> 01:44:05,270
Oh my gosh, we made it out of the...

1687
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:07,490
We're in the big city!

1688
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,170
The big apple, baby!

1689
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:11,090
Oh my god.

1690
01:44:13,390 --> 01:44:14,990
Blood for the blood goat.

1691
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:30,070
What if I stayed inside?

1692
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:48,190
Just die already, please.

1693
01:44:50,190 --> 01:44:51,310
Oh my god, there's even more?

1694
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:53,330
Just die already?

1695
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:53,770
Thank you.

1696
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:54,910
Thank you.

1697
01:44:55,230 --> 01:44:55,810
Thank you.

1698
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:57,210
And thank you.

1699
01:44:57,770 --> 01:44:58,850
And thank you.

1700
01:44:59,610 --> 01:45:00,750
Where are you actually?

1701
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:02,550
I can't even shoot you.

1702
01:45:04,770 --> 01:45:06,250
More blood goats.

1703
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:08,590
There he goes.

1704
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:12,590
You threw off my groove!

1705
01:45:13,030 --> 01:45:13,130
No!

1706
01:45:14,330 --> 01:45:16,310
I had such a good thing going.

1707
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:17,950
Kind of.

1708
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:19,570
A good thing asterisk, maybe.

1709
01:45:19,570 --> 01:45:20,790
Oh my god.

1710
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:21,290
Oh my god.

1711
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:24,310
I'm getting my ass...feet.

1712
01:45:32,860 --> 01:45:34,340
I did it.

1713
01:45:39,310 --> 01:45:41,170
No, I said the correct thing this time.

1714
01:45:48,160 --> 01:45:49,560
Ah, the silence.

1715
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:51,880
The silence of the city.

1716
01:45:58,680 --> 01:46:00,100
Let's go get our money.

1717
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:04,710
Excuse me.

1718
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:06,030
That's mine.

1719
01:46:12,610 --> 01:46:14,850
Dante doesn't know how to use his hands as usual.

1720
01:46:15,970 --> 01:46:17,110
Oh, his hands are full.

1721
01:46:17,210 --> 01:46:17,590
Never mind.

1722
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:19,090
He's got the guns.

1723
01:46:19,570 --> 01:46:19,930
You know what?

1724
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:21,090
I'll give him a pass this time.

1725
01:46:35,230 --> 01:46:35,670
Okay.

1726
01:46:38,030 --> 01:46:39,890
What is this music?

1727
01:46:41,570 --> 01:46:44,330
Oh my gosh, this looks like where Solidus died.

1728
01:46:46,630 --> 01:46:47,830
The time.

1729
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,410
The time god.

1730
01:46:51,550 --> 01:46:53,410
Spooky city music, yeah.

1731
01:46:56,930 --> 01:46:57,810
Spoilers!

1732
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:01,370
Are you...a...

1733
01:47:02,270 --> 01:47:02,930
Okay, hold on.

1734
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:05,210
Before we go in there, because I know that's where it wants me to go.

1735
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:10,370
Are you a mint phantom phantom if you don't actually know...

1736
01:47:12,230 --> 01:47:13,670
Metal gear facts?

1737
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:17,310
Is there anything over here?

1738
01:47:17,530 --> 01:47:18,070
Am I crazy?

1739
01:47:18,250 --> 01:47:18,390
No?

1740
01:47:18,470 --> 01:47:18,950
Okay, just kidding.

1741
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:25,910
If you hold R1 with a shotgun equipped, for some reason he will have the shotgun in one hand and a handgun in the other.

1742
01:47:26,630 --> 01:47:26,990
Huh?

1743
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:31,880
Oh, you're right.

1744
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:37,900
But he just only uses the...

1745
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:40,860
He just only uses the shotgun.

1746
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:44,540
Alright, into the parking garage.

1747
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:46,040
Never

1748
01:47:57,970 --> 01:47:58,210
mind.

1749
01:47:58,730 --> 01:48:00,390
We went through the parking garage.

1750
01:48:01,950 --> 01:48:03,930
That area would have sucked anyway.

1751
01:48:04,230 --> 01:48:06,450
I'm actually kind of happy that we don't have to go through it.

1752
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:08,350
I am going through it.

1753
01:48:09,470 --> 01:48:10,950
Just in other ways.

1754
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:15,050
I understand that I'm wanting to make the guns better, but do they have to make the swords suck?

1755
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:18,130
What the hell?

1756
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:24,070
Oh my god!

1757
01:48:24,410 --> 01:48:25,110
What the hell?

1758
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:26,050
Oh my god!

1759
01:48:26,090 --> 01:48:27,550
Now you're just a normal ass dude!

1760
01:48:28,290 --> 01:48:29,150
What is this?

1761
01:48:30,250 --> 01:48:32,070
You can't just become a normal enemy!

1762
01:48:38,580 --> 01:48:42,600
What does the green health... Wait, so it goes from green to...

1763
01:48:44,080 --> 01:48:48,460
I'm guessing green to yellow to red?

1764
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:01,500
Oh yeah, there it is.

1765
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:03,480
Green to yellow to red.

1766
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:06,760
It's okay.

1767
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:09,500
He's almost... Oh, to orange!

1768
01:49:23,530 --> 01:49:25,450
That's what happens when you use your sword, everybody.

1769
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:32,660
Wait, I'm sorry.

1770
01:49:33,540 --> 01:49:34,020
Where...

1771
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,140
Oh, I thought he was like gonna... Oh my goodness.

1772
01:49:37,440 --> 01:49:38,800
I thought he was gonna...

1773
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:47,840
I'm gonna handle this now, everybody.

1774
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,220
We're just gonna handle this now.

1775
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:53,900
In our own way, okay?

1776
01:49:55,720 --> 01:49:57,260
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1777
01:49:58,520 --> 01:50:00,120
These guys are just standing around.

1778
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:03,420
Quit monkeying around, guys!

1779
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,060
Little monkeys!

1780
01:50:09,820 --> 01:50:11,900
He didn't give us big money, did he?

1781
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:13,180
No.

1782
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:15,960
Big monkey, little money.

1783
01:50:16,420 --> 01:50:17,080
So sad.

1784
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:28,650
I'm not gonna lie, when fighting that monkey, the big one, my eyes started to glaze over.

1785
01:50:31,050 --> 01:50:33,690
Can I understand why DMC fans tell people to skip 2?

1786
01:50:36,170 --> 01:50:36,690
Yeah...

1787
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:39,010
It's only been 2 hours, though.

1788
01:50:40,370 --> 01:50:41,770
I still intend on beating it.

1789
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:48,810
However long it takes, you know, whatever.

1790
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:52,370
Oh, invisible wall.

1791
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:53,090
That's exciting.

1792
01:50:55,270 --> 01:50:56,770
They hate exploration.

1793
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:00,570
Over here?

1794
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:04,730
They hate exploration!

1795
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:12,250
About 5 hours.

1796
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:17,010
That's what I said on how long to beat, but I always add a couple more for me.

1797
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:20,170
Like 2 or 3 more.

1798
01:51:20,410 --> 01:51:21,930
This is where I came through.

1799
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:23,770
So, monkey.

1800
01:51:24,170 --> 01:51:25,730
Or is it...

1801
01:51:27,990 --> 01:51:28,470
Hello?

1802
01:51:43,670 --> 01:51:45,130
I'm estimating 8 hours.

1803
01:51:45,250 --> 01:51:46,930
Yeah, that's about what I was thinking too.

1804
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:48,090
Hello?

1805
01:51:50,390 --> 01:51:51,370
Over the truck?

1806
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:51,930
Oh, okay.

1807
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:55,790
I thought I couldn't go that way because it was preventing me.

1808
01:51:58,990 --> 01:51:59,510
No!

1809
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:00,390
Ah, gosh.

1810
01:52:00,570 --> 01:52:02,710
The camera angles make me all tripped up.

1811
01:52:12,990 --> 01:52:14,150
Oh, okay.

1812
01:52:37,580 --> 01:52:38,620
Infested tank!

1813
01:52:49,080 --> 01:52:50,740
Can I just stand on top of it?

1814
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:10,930
What else is shooting at me?

1815
01:53:14,410 --> 01:53:15,330
No way.

1816
01:53:15,330 --> 01:53:15,370
Okay.

1817
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:17,590
This is actually working.

1818
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:28,960
Guys?

1819
01:53:30,760 --> 01:53:34,040
There appears to be a third tank.

1820
01:53:40,540 --> 01:53:41,040
Oh, my gosh.

1821
01:53:48,010 --> 01:53:49,610
What if I stand back here?

1822
01:53:52,110 --> 01:53:54,270
Wait, don't shoot down, Dante.

1823
01:53:54,750 --> 01:53:56,890
You have a literal thing...

1824
01:53:58,330 --> 01:54:02,610
You have a literal thing that is telling you where to shoot.

1825
01:54:02,610 --> 01:54:03,230
Oh, my gosh.

1826
01:54:03,370 --> 01:54:04,190
I'm gonna need more money.

1827
01:54:05,310 --> 01:54:07,490
I'm so used to saying more money in these games.

1828
01:54:07,830 --> 01:54:10,190
I'm gonna need more health in this.

1829
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:10,870
You know what?

1830
01:54:10,930 --> 01:54:11,270
I'll DT.

1831
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:15,870
It'll heal me, at least.

1832
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:17,570
A little bit.

1833
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:23,570
Where's the other one?

1834
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:24,190
There it is.

1835
01:54:30,330 --> 01:54:33,910
Can the other one hit me from here is the question.

1836
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:36,230
Can the

1837
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:47,690
other one hit me from here is the big question.

1838
01:54:49,250 --> 01:54:50,850
You DT when low health mode?

1839
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,190
You go sicko, really?

1840
01:54:55,610 --> 01:54:59,450
Wow, guys.

1841
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:04,810
This is just doing really awesome stuff.

1842
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:08,530
Mega DT.

1843
01:55:09,430 --> 01:55:10,410
Good to know.

1844
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,720
It's like trying to hit me.

1845
01:55:25,100 --> 01:55:28,380
So glad to see the stinker playing the best DLC game.

1846
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,140
Let's go get the other one.

1847
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,420
Wherever it is.

1848
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:37,660
Try shotgun?

1849
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:38,400
Oh, yeah.

1850
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:38,880
I'll try.

1851
01:56:01,690 --> 01:56:02,830
That's what I was about to do.

1852
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:03,570
I was about to jump.

1853
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,980
I think the others are better for this.

1854
01:56:13,360 --> 01:56:14,360
I'm trapped.

1855
01:56:15,640 --> 01:56:16,520
There we go.

1856
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:19,680
DT?

1857
01:56:19,940 --> 01:56:20,400
So true.

1858
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:27,600
Oh wait!

1859
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:27,960
Ouch!

1860
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:29,760
No!

1861
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,260
I was getting hurt at the same time!

1862
01:56:50,030 --> 01:56:52,150
When can't I ever get more grorbs?

1863
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:54,110
Maybe I must search.

1864
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:57,230
Had a dream last night.

1865
01:56:57,310 --> 01:56:59,350
I attended an official mint cafe.

1866
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:01,810
Oh my gosh.

1867
01:57:01,970 --> 01:57:05,050
I'd go crazy if that ever happened.

1868
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:23,350
I know that if I raise my style meter, I get more grorbs, but I don't really care.

1869
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:26,430
I'll be honest.

1870
01:57:31,470 --> 01:57:32,470
I can't.

1871
01:57:32,550 --> 01:57:32,850
Come on.

1872
01:57:33,310 --> 01:57:34,590
Suck it in, Dante.

1873
01:57:35,710 --> 01:57:36,770
Skinny legend.

1874
01:57:44,640 --> 01:57:46,180
Where am I?

1875
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:51,260
Is this where I'm supposed to go?

1876
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:53,400
Not up the ramp?

1877
01:58:05,330 --> 01:58:06,430
What do I get?

1878
01:58:08,570 --> 01:58:12,390
A magic stone with the heart of a vigorous battle god.

1879
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:13,590
An offense heart?

1880
01:58:15,210 --> 01:58:16,370
What does that mean?

1881
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:22,640
I was hoping for a grorb.

1882
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:28,280
I think it automatically...hold on...equips, right?

1883
01:58:31,120 --> 01:58:31,580
Yeah!

1884
01:58:31,580 --> 01:58:32,480
Automatically equipped.

1885
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:33,000
Nice.

1886
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:34,940
More damage.

1887
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:35,480
Let's go.

1888
01:58:36,720 --> 01:58:37,660
I'm gonna save.

1889
01:58:37,780 --> 01:58:41,600
I don't know if this will do anything, but just because I'm so low on health...

1890
01:58:44,340 --> 01:58:45,640
I think that worked.

1891
01:58:49,360 --> 01:58:49,800
Nice.

1892
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:51,380
Cool, we found that.

1893
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:54,620
Is there anything on the other side?

1894
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:58,440
I'm just exploring, trying to find something to heal me.

1895
01:59:00,220 --> 01:59:01,180
Maybe up here.

1896
01:59:08,460 --> 01:59:09,980
Up here.

1897
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:12,140
Oh my

1898
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:44,570
God, where am I?

1899
01:59:46,550 --> 01:59:48,130
Where is the copter?

1900
01:59:49,110 --> 01:59:49,910
Oh there it is.

1901
01:59:54,140 --> 01:59:54,780
Oh my God.

1902
01:59:57,770 --> 01:59:59,250
Am I doing damage?

1903
02:00:18,910 --> 02:00:19,670
Yes!

1904
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:26,570
Where did it leave me at?

1905
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:39,520
Do I have to do all that again?

1906
02:00:53,160 --> 02:00:54,500
No way.

1907
02:01:12,170 --> 02:01:13,890
No way!

1908
02:01:15,650 --> 02:01:17,470
It's just such a...

1909
02:01:17,470 --> 02:01:22,630
They weren't difficult, it's just such a time consuming thing.

1910
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:24,230
Oh come on.

1911
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:28,630
They just eat.

1912
02:01:31,890 --> 02:01:35,310
But I got the other thing for my DT, which is nice.

1913
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,600
That's DMC2.

1914
02:01:40,600 --> 02:01:41,040
What?

1915
02:01:44,280 --> 02:01:47,040
Everything is so tanky in this game.

1916
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:48,180
I don't understand.

1917
02:01:48,620 --> 02:01:51,520
They're not very difficult, it's just all of it...

1918
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:52,820
Like actual... Oh my God.

1919
02:01:53,560 --> 02:01:54,340
Okay, nevermind.

1920
02:01:54,840 --> 02:01:56,500
Like actual literal tanks.

1921
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:04,900
Actually I wonder if me being on the ground is better for this one.

1922
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:10,220
Why you can't... It's just shooting into the air.

1923
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:12,880
Oh, there it goes.

1924
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:14,380
Finally it grew a brain.

1925
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,460
What the... What is this?

1926
02:02:33,700 --> 02:02:36,440
I feel so slow for some reason.

1927
02:02:54,430 --> 02:02:55,790
Aren't you having fun?

1928
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:04,790
I'm just gonna do this.

1929
02:03:05,870 --> 02:03:06,510
Oh, nevermind.

1930
02:03:10,710 --> 02:03:12,410
This guy is actually fast.

1931
02:03:23,700 --> 02:03:26,540
Sometimes they take big hit and sometimes little hit.

1932
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:27,980
I don't understand why.

1933
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:36,720
Sometimes big hit, sometimes teeny tiny hit.

1934
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:44,720
I think it's like where I'm shooting at.

1935
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,280
If you hit the eye you do more damage.

1936
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,060
Oh my God, he's actually doing something else.

1937
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:55,700
Oh my God, they are actual enemies in the game.

1938
02:03:55,800 --> 02:03:56,460
This is incredible.

1939
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:57,980
Oh my God.

1940
02:03:57,980 --> 02:04:00,020
Oh, now you wanna do something.

1941
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,260
Now you wanna hit me?

1942
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:02,520
What is this?

1943
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:12,580
Makes no sense.

1944
02:04:31,560 --> 02:04:32,900
Oh my God.

1945
02:04:33,660 --> 02:04:35,020
What is this?

1946
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:54,640
Samir is DT running out faster.

1947
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,620
It feels that way, right?

1948
02:04:55,780 --> 02:04:58,240
Like I feel like I had a full thing...

1949
02:04:58,760 --> 02:05:00,340
And I got to use it for like 2 seconds.

1950
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:09,130
Yeah, Dante definitely needs some snarky one liners.

1951
02:05:14,570 --> 02:05:16,730
Bun uses the DT faster.

1952
02:05:16,930 --> 02:05:17,910
No way, is that true?

1953
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:21,190
Okay,

1954
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:32,260
so the offense heart did stay.

1955
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,160
That's so strange.

1956
02:05:36,240 --> 02:05:37,360
Automaton tank.

1957
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:37,420
Tank.

1958
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:48,880
It's all the way up here.

1959
02:05:54,610 --> 02:05:56,270
Rorb and blorb.

1960
02:05:58,290 --> 02:05:58,890
Wait,

1961
02:06:10,040 --> 02:06:11,160
now I'm gonna have to... Hold on.

1962
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:13,500
Maybe I can avoid the...

1963
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:18,370
Hold on.

1964
02:06:19,210 --> 02:06:20,030
We got this.

1965
02:06:21,370 --> 02:06:22,790
Now I can go back for this.

1966
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,440
There we go.

1967
02:06:36,340 --> 02:06:37,280
We're good.

1968
02:06:37,440 --> 02:06:37,700
We're good.

1969
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:38,840
Exit.

1970
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,120
No, no, no.

1971
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,420
Exit.

1972
02:06:41,660 --> 02:06:42,040
There we go.

1973
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,420
I'm cartwheeling.

1974
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:54,040
I'm styling.

1975
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:55,180
I'm styling.

1976
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:04,490
Okay.

1977
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:10,040
More progress.

1978
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:19,220
So no jump on the helicopter.

1979
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,280
I understand now.

1980
02:07:23,340 --> 02:07:23,740
Oh.

1981
02:07:25,220 --> 02:07:26,020
Anything here?

1982
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:26,460
Nope.

1983
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:28,240
This is where we were before.

1984
02:07:28,440 --> 02:07:29,080
Okay, just kidding.

1985
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:30,380
Let me out.

1986
02:07:30,680 --> 02:07:31,240
Let me out.

1987
02:07:32,760 --> 02:07:36,720
Not into the fire, because I feel like this is the type of game that would hurt you with the fire.

1988
02:07:42,150 --> 02:07:43,310
Run in this part.

1989
02:07:43,650 --> 02:07:45,270
No, it was surrounded by fire.

1990
02:07:45,970 --> 02:07:47,010
I don't think you can run.

1991
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:47,710
Run.

1992
02:07:50,570 --> 02:07:51,690
I'm guessing... Okay.

1993
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:52,550
There we go.

1994
02:07:59,350 --> 02:08:03,730
It just kind of comes here and twitches a little and we don't say anything.

1995
02:08:04,070 --> 02:08:05,450
Like we're just...

1996
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:07,450
It just kind of is like...

1997
02:08:11,090 --> 02:08:13,130
It doesn't really do anything.

1998
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:22,930
Oh, wait.

1999
02:08:23,330 --> 02:08:23,810
I

2000
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:29,760
wonder if this is better.

2001
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:36,100
I don't know where I went, but...

2002
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:42,230
If

2003
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:59,100
I go back outside...

2004
02:09:13,700 --> 02:09:15,100
I can't go out!

2005
02:09:47,100 --> 02:09:48,900
Who designed this building?

2006
02:09:51,960 --> 02:09:52,780
Who designed this?

2007
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,000
This makes no sense.

2008
02:09:57,720 --> 02:09:58,660
Oh, there's a door there.

2009
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:00,680
Sorry, it was me.

2010
02:10:09,990 --> 02:10:11,190
Gosh, wisps.

2011
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:15,510
Wait, I can't do the famous Dante jump from...

2012
02:10:15,510 --> 02:10:15,990
No!

2013
02:10:23,050 --> 02:10:25,730
I don't know... The music is stressing me out.

2014
02:10:28,150 --> 02:10:32,730
I feel like I should be doing something way more awesome than...

2015
02:10:37,020 --> 02:10:37,860
What's going on?

2016
02:10:38,900 --> 02:10:39,560
Oh, shoot.

2017
02:10:41,420 --> 02:10:42,360
Oh my god.

2018
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:43,860
Oh my god, I can't see!

2019
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:58,200
What?

2020
02:11:05,350 --> 02:11:06,830
Where am I supposed to go from?

2021
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:07,810
Okay.

2022
02:11:08,130 --> 02:11:11,710
Thanks for... He's like patiently waiting for me, which is really nice.

2023
02:11:12,350 --> 02:11:13,730
He's not really bothering me.

2024
02:11:13,730 --> 02:11:14,350
What?

2025
02:11:15,110 --> 02:11:16,470
I'm trying to run!

2026
02:11:18,030 --> 02:11:19,290
I'm trying to run!

2027
02:11:22,410 --> 02:11:24,730
Oh, oh, I need to...

2028
02:11:25,330 --> 02:11:26,030
Oh my god.

2029
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:31,110
Oh my god, that was close.

2030
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:38,830
Is it like a fire?

2031
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:40,050
The building's on fire?

2032
02:11:40,870 --> 02:11:41,230
Dante!

2033
02:11:41,590 --> 02:11:42,550
Oh my gosh, Dante.

2034
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:44,290
Dante, Dante.

2035
02:11:44,670 --> 02:11:45,650
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

2036
02:11:46,350 --> 02:11:46,670
No!

2037
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:57,060
I guess they're like, if you're not good at the wall...

2038
02:11:57,060 --> 02:11:59,260
The wall jumps, you'll get good, I guess.

2039
02:12:00,580 --> 02:12:02,600
Oh my god, my depth perception, though.

2040
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:04,760
Please.

2041
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:06,840
Ouch!

2042
02:12:08,080 --> 02:12:09,040
I made it!

2043
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:24,660
That's all I gotta do?

2044
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:45,890
Oh my god.

2045
02:12:45,890 --> 02:12:46,710
Oh my god.

2046
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:50,230
That's not how missiles should be working!

2047
02:12:54,910 --> 02:12:56,610
Oh my gosh.

2048
02:13:00,450 --> 02:13:01,350
Ouch!

2049
02:13:06,790 --> 02:13:07,270
Hello?

2050
02:13:09,670 --> 02:13:12,090
These are demon missiles, so...

2051
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:12,670
Oh my gosh.

2052
02:13:14,810 --> 02:13:16,270
So true.

2053
02:13:16,270 --> 02:13:16,370
Hello?

2054
02:13:22,590 --> 02:13:24,990
Maybe I don't wanna stand there.

2055
02:13:26,190 --> 02:13:28,250
Why is this so familiar?

2056
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,190
Oh my gosh.

2057
02:13:34,010 --> 02:13:34,910
Oh god.

2058
02:13:35,030 --> 02:13:36,610
Okay, I do have to actually shoot them.

2059
02:13:37,230 --> 02:13:38,190
Or they won't stop.

2060
02:13:38,930 --> 02:13:39,490
Good to know.

2061
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:44,550
Shooting you from all the way over here.

2062
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:45,950
You're shooting me.

2063
02:13:50,790 --> 02:13:52,030
I'm shooting you.

2064
02:13:52,430 --> 02:13:53,990
We're shooting each other.

2065
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,720
I'm shooting you.

2066
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:02,200
You're shooting me.

2067
02:14:02,700 --> 02:14:04,100
We're shooting each other.

2068
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:07,520
That's just how these things work.

2069
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:09,220
Oh, I ran right into it.

2070
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:11,780
I was trying to get in between it.

2071
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:14,920
I can't tell if I'm hitting anything.

2072
02:14:16,060 --> 02:14:16,880
Oh, I am now.

2073
02:14:16,980 --> 02:14:17,380
Okay, good.

2074
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:22,640
Okay, you're shooting me, I'm shooting you.

2075
02:14:23,740 --> 02:14:26,060
That's just how these games are.

2076
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:27,120
Oh my god!

2077
02:14:29,740 --> 02:14:30,980
I'm shooting you.

2078
02:14:31,180 --> 02:14:31,740
Oh my gosh.

2079
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:34,540
I'm shooting you.

2080
02:14:35,320 --> 02:14:36,580
You're shooting me.

2081
02:14:39,940 --> 02:14:44,720
Wait, why is he getting so shaky like that?

2082
02:14:44,760 --> 02:14:45,200
What's happening?

2083
02:14:46,240 --> 02:14:47,340
Oh, he's almost dead.

2084
02:14:48,060 --> 02:14:49,160
Just a little bit more.

2085
02:14:49,900 --> 02:14:51,120
Just a little bit more.

2086
02:14:58,900 --> 02:15:00,200
I think... Oh my gosh.

2087
02:15:00,620 --> 02:15:01,380
Yeah, there we go.

2088
02:15:09,680 --> 02:15:10,120
Okay.

2089
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:16,410
We did it.

2090
02:15:16,970 --> 02:15:18,210
Everything is barred.

2091
02:15:19,670 --> 02:15:20,110
Gosh.

2092
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:22,490
What?!

2093
02:15:35,320 --> 02:15:36,360
Where is he?

2094
02:15:36,580 --> 02:15:37,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2095
02:15:38,020 --> 02:15:41,360
Oh, you get new health, but I have to stay in my old same health.

2096
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:43,740
What kind of madness is this, huh?

2097
02:16:02,160 --> 02:16:03,020
Phase 5!

2098
02:16:03,440 --> 02:16:04,320
Don't say that.

2099
02:16:04,540 --> 02:16:05,960
I don't even know if you're joking or not.

2100
02:16:06,320 --> 02:16:08,400
I don't even know where the heck this thing is.

2101
02:16:09,260 --> 02:16:11,540
Oh, it's telling me to go over there?

2102
02:16:12,440 --> 02:16:13,580
And go up?

2103
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:21,940
What if I did that after I killed the stupid helicopter that is trying to murder me?

2104
02:16:21,940 --> 02:16:22,500
Oh.

2105
02:16:25,020 --> 02:16:27,420
I should dodge roll for those, shouldn't I?

2106
02:16:40,550 --> 02:16:41,210
What the?

2107
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:43,410
Wait, where am I going?

2108
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,710
Game?

2109
02:16:45,450 --> 02:16:45,890
Game?

2110
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:47,990
Upwards?

2111
02:16:48,350 --> 02:16:49,750
Game, I can't see anything anymore.

2112
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:51,730
Why are there other enemies?

2113
02:16:52,070 --> 02:16:52,790
Leave me alone!

2114
02:16:53,230 --> 02:16:54,490
Don't I have enough to deal with?

2115
02:16:54,670 --> 02:16:56,070
Oh my gosh, these assholes.

2116
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:02,580
Leave me alone!

2117
02:17:03,560 --> 02:17:06,640
The poo-poo... The poo-poos.

2118
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:09,800
Okay, there we go.

2119
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:13,080
Upwards... Oh shoot!

2120
02:17:15,040 --> 02:17:16,660
That's what I'm gonna do, baby.

2121
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:19,320
To these damn poo-poos.

2122
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:25,920
Stupid ass birds, I hate birds.

2123
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:27,480
Stupid birds!

2124
02:17:27,640 --> 02:17:29,320
Actually, that's a lie, I really love birds.

2125
02:17:31,780 --> 02:17:33,400
I like the ones that talk.

2126
02:17:34,620 --> 02:17:36,620
It's a little disturbing, but like...

2127
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:38,520
It's pretty fun, I think.

2128
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:41,560
Favorite bird?

2129
02:17:43,520 --> 02:17:45,400
I don't think I really have a favorite.

2130
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:50,380
Gosh, why is this mission the longest mission ever in the world?

2131
02:17:52,280 --> 02:17:54,620
And there's also...

2132
02:17:57,780 --> 02:17:58,360
Nice.

2133
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:02,260
Oh my gosh, I got full health.

2134
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,940
Okay, I missed every single...

2135
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:13,300
At least I got the gorb!

2136
02:18:14,260 --> 02:18:15,760
Oh my gosh, we're still going.

2137
02:18:19,180 --> 02:18:19,700
Okay.

2138
02:18:20,520 --> 02:18:22,300
Where is the helicopter coming back?

2139
02:18:22,360 --> 02:18:23,240
Where do I go from here?

2140
02:18:23,680 --> 02:18:26,020
You show me that area, I can't see shit.

2141
02:18:26,900 --> 02:18:27,800
Do I go up here?

2142
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:33,770
I guess?

2143
02:18:34,190 --> 02:18:35,450
I'm so lost.

2144
02:18:36,270 --> 02:18:37,690
Is this where I'm supposed to be climbing?

2145
02:18:38,550 --> 02:18:39,390
Is this correct?

2146
02:18:40,130 --> 02:18:40,770
Oh my god.

2147
02:18:46,770 --> 02:18:48,590
Dante, you are aiming.

2148
02:18:48,870 --> 02:18:50,390
You are literally aiming.

2149
02:18:50,610 --> 02:18:53,550
Why don't you not shoot where you aim at?

2150
02:18:53,730 --> 02:18:54,330
There we go.

2151
02:18:54,950 --> 02:18:55,870
My goodness.

2152
02:18:57,410 --> 02:18:58,710
The rorbs show the way?

2153
02:18:58,890 --> 02:18:59,050
Okay.

2154
02:19:01,110 --> 02:19:03,610
I'm following the rorbs!

2155
02:19:04,410 --> 02:19:05,310
Oh, please!

2156
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:07,530
What is this?

2157
02:19:07,590 --> 02:19:08,470
Getting over it?

2158
02:19:08,650 --> 02:19:10,130
No, I can't do this!

2159
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:11,170
Oh my god.

2160
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:26,840
This might actually tilt me enough.

2161
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:31,160
Okay.

2162
02:19:31,640 --> 02:19:31,980
Alright.

2163
02:20:02,850 --> 02:20:04,590
Equip DT and fly.

2164
02:20:07,550 --> 02:20:09,810
Oh, I don't have enough DT.

2165
02:20:15,550 --> 02:20:16,830
I guess we'll try.

2166
02:20:24,190 --> 02:20:26,630
How much of this will I have to redo if I die?

2167
02:20:29,690 --> 02:20:30,710
Okay, screw it.

2168
02:20:30,970 --> 02:20:31,190
Fly!

2169
02:20:31,510 --> 02:20:31,810
Fly!

2170
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:32,550
Fly!

2171
02:20:32,830 --> 02:20:34,290
It's the slowest ever.

2172
02:20:34,590 --> 02:20:35,990
It doesn't go down so fast.

2173
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:38,510
Because I'm not using my guns.

2174
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:39,790
Oh my god!

2175
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:43,290
You guys saved me!

2176
02:20:43,870 --> 02:20:44,770
Thank you!

2177
02:21:05,180 --> 02:21:05,740
Okay.

2178
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:07,460
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2179
02:21:09,280 --> 02:21:10,800
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2180
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:13,440
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2181
02:21:17,940 --> 02:21:21,840
I don't know where it is, but I'm apparently getting it.

2182
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:23,060
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2183
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:24,560
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2184
02:21:26,220 --> 02:21:27,740
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2185
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:33,820
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2186
02:21:35,180 --> 02:21:36,740
What is happening?

2187
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:39,600
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2188
02:21:41,080 --> 02:21:42,820
How did I get all the way over there?

2189
02:21:43,180 --> 02:21:45,340
Sorry, I'm not paying attention at all.

2190
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:47,240
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2191
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:52,080
I'm just gonna keep shooting.

2192
02:21:52,080 --> 02:21:53,980
I'm just gonna keep shooting?

2193
02:21:54,440 --> 02:21:55,820
Just gonna keep shooting?

2194
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:57,600
Just gonna keep shooting?

2195
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:58,460
Oh my god.

2196
02:21:58,920 --> 02:21:59,360
Oh my god.

2197
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:00,060
Ouchie, ouch.

2198
02:22:01,320 --> 02:22:03,840
That's a big numbers on me.

2199
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:16,190
Just gonna keep shooting?

2200
02:22:29,630 --> 02:22:31,710
This is like the actually...

2201
02:22:31,710 --> 02:22:32,310
Oh my gosh.

2202
02:22:32,930 --> 02:22:33,670
Holy moly.

2203
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:36,670
This feels like actually the longest chapter...

2204
02:22:37,990 --> 02:22:38,550
Ever.

2205
02:22:39,650 --> 02:22:42,150
I feel like I've been on this mission for 15 years.

2206
02:22:45,770 --> 02:22:51,210
If this chapter were a human, this chapter would be able to legally drink.

2207
02:22:51,890 --> 02:22:52,330
I think.

2208
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:59,770
He just spawned in.

2209
02:23:01,570 --> 02:23:02,430
Where did he go?

2210
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:03,630
Just gonna keep shooting?

2211
02:23:03,630 --> 02:23:05,550
He's like above me.

2212
02:23:07,570 --> 02:23:09,830
Like the shadow just spawns in sometimes.

2213
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:16,510
Just gonna keep shooting?

2214
02:23:17,390 --> 02:23:18,670
Just gonna keep shooting?

2215
02:23:19,610 --> 02:23:20,030
Oh shoot.

2216
02:23:20,510 --> 02:23:21,090
Oh my gosh.

2217
02:23:22,310 --> 02:23:23,670
He's actually doing something.

2218
02:23:24,850 --> 02:23:26,910
I didn't know I could fall off.

2219
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:27,890
That's insane.

2220
02:23:28,570 --> 02:23:29,050
Oh my gosh.

2221
02:23:29,890 --> 02:23:31,030
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2222
02:23:32,310 --> 02:23:35,310
Well, that requires some DT.

2223
02:23:40,970 --> 02:23:42,730
Oh, it's dead!

2224
02:23:45,390 --> 02:23:50,370
All of that climbing Dante, just for you to jump...

2225
02:23:55,010 --> 02:23:56,090
I'm cool.

2226
02:24:06,570 --> 02:24:08,010
My god.

2227
02:24:10,930 --> 02:24:12,890
Oh, no, I already did it.

2228
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:14,970
Here we go.

2229
02:24:15,830 --> 02:24:18,410
37 minutes for that one mission.

2230
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:19,630
Holy hell!

2231
02:24:21,150 --> 02:24:22,390
Good lord.

2232
02:24:29,010 --> 02:24:33,070
I think that's what I was just on was Tower of Misery.

2233
02:24:34,090 --> 02:24:35,150
For real.

2234
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:39,270
Is there any items we should buy?

2235
02:24:39,390 --> 02:24:42,710
Maybe we should buy some devil stars.

2236
02:24:42,710 --> 02:24:45,590
Do they work the same as in before?

2237
02:24:50,750 --> 02:24:51,550
Upgrade sword?

2238
02:24:51,730 --> 02:24:53,030
No, I won't be using it.

2239
02:24:54,630 --> 02:24:56,050
Oh, it's the plorb, right?

2240
02:24:57,530 --> 02:25:00,210
The plorb is what we gotta get, right?

2241
02:25:00,730 --> 02:25:02,110
Plorbs and plorbs, baby.

2242
02:25:09,710 --> 02:25:10,550
Upgrade pistol?

2243
02:25:10,730 --> 02:25:11,890
You saw how much it was?

2244
02:25:12,590 --> 02:25:14,610
It's 30,000.

2245
02:25:15,710 --> 02:25:17,930
I'm actually gonna do two plorbs.

2246
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:20,310
Nevermind.

2247
02:25:21,350 --> 02:25:22,750
Oh, it went up in price.

2248
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:24,770
You absolutely asshole.

2249
02:25:34,830 --> 02:25:38,910
I need more money to get the...

2250
02:25:48,250 --> 02:25:49,750
Where am I actually?

2251
02:25:50,190 --> 02:25:51,830
This is where the parking garage is.

2252
02:25:51,890 --> 02:25:52,530
That's what I thought.

2253
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:57,250
I'm here again because...

2254
02:25:58,790 --> 02:25:59,190
What?

2255
02:26:04,060 --> 02:26:05,540
I'm here again, why?

2256
02:26:09,580 --> 02:26:10,920
Real cutscene.

2257
02:26:12,060 --> 02:26:12,860
Oh

2258
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:21,420
my god, the pregnant building!

2259
02:26:23,020 --> 02:26:23,400
Already?

2260
02:26:25,500 --> 02:26:26,820
Warplation, true.

2261
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:37,870
Oh my god!

2262
02:26:37,870 --> 02:26:37,970
I'm dead.

2263
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:44,270
My controller was rumbling so much, it felt nice.

2264
02:26:45,890 --> 02:26:47,810
I was giving my thigh a massage.

2265
02:26:54,460 --> 02:26:55,700
So loud, oh my gosh.

2266
02:26:55,940 --> 02:26:57,640
Why didn't you say anything, Dante?

2267
02:26:59,080 --> 02:26:59,680
Oh, ouch.

2268
02:27:02,480 --> 02:27:03,400
Nef Asteris.

2269
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:07,120
Oh, what the?

2270
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:09,440
It looked like it was up in the sky.

2271
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:10,800
Oh my god, I'm gonna die here.

2272
02:27:21,740 --> 02:27:23,660
Now he's eating the ground?

2273
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:26,180
What am I shooting at?

2274
02:27:29,290 --> 02:27:30,480
What am I shooting at?

2275
02:27:31,280 --> 02:27:32,160
Oh, little bats?

2276
02:27:32,400 --> 02:27:33,260
Actual bats.

2277
02:27:34,060 --> 02:27:34,360
Why?

2278
02:27:35,860 --> 02:27:37,180
Bats all over the place?

2279
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:37,480
Okay.

2280
02:27:38,860 --> 02:27:40,340
Thanks for that, alright.

2281
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:41,940
Okay.

2282
02:27:42,700 --> 02:27:43,400
Okay.

2283
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:44,840
Okay.

2284
02:27:46,330 --> 02:27:47,900
What is he doing?

2285
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:50,320
What am I doing?

2286
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:52,340
What's happening?

2287
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:57,720
What's going on?

2288
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:05,640
Okay.

2289
02:28:32,400 --> 02:28:34,000
Just keep doing that, man.

2290
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:38,120
It actually got me that one time.

2291
02:28:44,130 --> 02:28:45,250
Oh, I see, I see.

2292
02:28:45,850 --> 02:28:46,790
There's a big one.

2293
02:28:46,890 --> 02:28:47,510
Oh, ouch, ouch.

2294
02:28:47,650 --> 02:28:47,830
Okay.

2295
02:28:56,910 --> 02:28:58,350
Mini Man!

2296
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:09,700
Oh my god.

2297
02:29:11,020 --> 02:29:12,640
Ouch, ouch.

2298
02:29:12,720 --> 02:29:13,700
How am I supposed to avoid that?

2299
02:29:37,270 --> 02:29:38,470
Oh gosh.

2300
02:29:40,430 --> 02:29:40,970
Okay.

2301
02:29:41,570 --> 02:29:42,370
Okay.

2302
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:47,030
I don't understand these lines at all.

2303
02:29:48,910 --> 02:29:51,030
Also, I'm hearing, like, something dying.

2304
02:29:52,950 --> 02:29:53,170
No!

2305
02:29:53,630 --> 02:29:54,510
Not these again.

2306
02:29:56,070 --> 02:29:56,990
No way.

2307
02:29:59,150 --> 02:30:03,930
I'm hearing, like, the noises coming from the left side of my...

2308
02:30:03,930 --> 02:30:05,210
I'm so confused.

2309
02:30:05,790 --> 02:30:07,270
How have I lost so much health?

2310
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:08,590
Oh gosh.

2311
02:30:09,530 --> 02:30:11,290
Oh no, it's still, you know what, it's fine.

2312
02:30:14,350 --> 02:30:14,990
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2313
02:30:14,990 --> 02:30:16,810
I don't

2314
02:30:28,350 --> 02:30:29,830
understand this part.

2315
02:30:31,010 --> 02:30:32,990
I'm just gonna go behind them and shoot.

2316
02:30:35,310 --> 02:30:37,050
It gets so close to me.

2317
02:30:37,710 --> 02:30:38,490
Oh my god!

2318
02:30:48,030 --> 02:30:49,230
Alright, nevermind.

2319
02:31:01,470 --> 02:31:03,230
I'm not worried.

2320
02:31:07,210 --> 02:31:08,110
Oh, shoot.

2321
02:31:08,230 --> 02:31:09,950
Oh my god.

2322
02:31:10,910 --> 02:31:13,430
I think I can just dodge everything though.

2323
02:31:16,630 --> 02:31:19,090
I wish I could get more DT, please.

2324
02:31:19,550 --> 02:31:20,290
Just a little bit.

2325
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:29,350
This is so...

2326
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:32,190
This is just so...

2327
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:38,830
I'm gonna get a little bit more before I DT.

2328
02:31:44,590 --> 02:31:45,450
You know what?

2329
02:31:50,350 --> 02:31:51,470
Actually, this works.

2330
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:11,350
No!

2331
02:32:16,310 --> 02:32:16,850
Oh, okay.

2332
02:32:18,310 --> 02:32:19,190
I was gonna...

2333
02:32:20,330 --> 02:32:20,850
No!

2334
02:32:21,170 --> 02:32:22,050
No, please!

2335
02:32:22,170 --> 02:32:22,750
God, no!

2336
02:32:25,070 --> 02:32:26,090
Oh, that's it.

2337
02:32:26,290 --> 02:32:27,810
Dante had nothing to say about it.

2338
02:32:27,870 --> 02:32:29,990
Dante is so quiet!

2339
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:32,010
Five minutes.

2340
02:32:32,230 --> 02:32:33,150
Oh, it feels so good.

2341
02:32:36,950 --> 02:32:37,430
Oh!

2342
02:32:37,650 --> 02:32:38,410
I forgot to save.

2343
02:32:38,730 --> 02:32:39,130
You know what?

2344
02:32:39,910 --> 02:32:40,870
Maybe it's fine.

2345
02:32:42,090 --> 02:32:44,530
A meeting of power shall end in conflict.

2346
02:32:44,690 --> 02:32:49,190
Wait, so they had that whole big cutscene just for that guy and all he does is go...

2347
02:32:53,650 --> 02:32:54,690
That's all he did!

2348
02:32:54,890 --> 02:32:55,550
He did nothing!

2349
02:32:56,130 --> 02:32:57,150
Oh my god!

2350
02:32:57,150 --> 02:33:03,050
He threw out some bats and puked up some orbs and that was it?

2351
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:13,430
That was all he did?

2352
02:33:18,470 --> 02:33:19,550
TMC2 Dante vs.

2353
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:20,750
MGSV Snake.

2354
02:33:20,830 --> 02:33:22,130
Both are oiled up butt naked.

2355
02:33:22,230 --> 02:33:23,390
Who's winning the quiet game?

2356
02:33:25,230 --> 02:33:29,530
I think I've actually only heard Dante speak one time, so right now he's...

2357
02:33:30,630 --> 02:33:31,570
He's winning.

2358
02:33:33,030 --> 02:33:34,770
I haven't even heard him grunt.

2359
02:33:35,770 --> 02:33:36,810
I've only...

2360
02:33:39,530 --> 02:33:41,710
I think Dante's winning so far.

2361
02:33:43,730 --> 02:33:45,270
Where's the sexy lady at?

2362
02:33:45,290 --> 02:33:45,930
Where'd she go?

2363
02:33:46,910 --> 02:33:48,710
Yeah, Snake at least speaks in the tapes.

2364
02:33:49,490 --> 02:33:50,090
Barely.

2365
02:33:51,290 --> 02:33:53,450
I love all of Dante's famous lines in this.

2366
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:55,530
Like...

2367
02:33:56,970 --> 02:33:57,570
And...

2368
02:33:57,570 --> 02:33:58,310
So true!

2369
02:34:00,610 --> 02:34:02,790
Okay, should I power up?

2370
02:34:03,250 --> 02:34:06,530
I'm gonna maybe save up for handgun level.

2371
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:10,210
Or do I want to get another porb?

2372
02:34:10,290 --> 02:34:11,270
Or get a porb?

2373
02:34:11,610 --> 02:34:12,930
No, I'll get a porb.

2374
02:34:13,530 --> 02:34:15,550
I'm gonna get a porb and then we'll start saving up.

2375
02:34:19,180 --> 02:34:20,120
Mission start.

2376
02:34:23,520 --> 02:34:27,220
Okay, if he speaks in this cutscene...

2377
02:34:27,920 --> 02:34:28,820
I'll eat my foot.

2378
02:34:31,020 --> 02:34:32,540
Metal... Mother Base?

2379
02:34:38,330 --> 02:34:40,510
He did not speak in that cutscene.

2380
02:34:40,570 --> 02:34:41,870
In fact, we didn't even see him.

2381
02:34:47,010 --> 02:34:48,150
Oh, okay.

2382
02:34:49,290 --> 02:34:51,490
Guys, my foot is saved today.

2383
02:34:51,910 --> 02:34:52,750
What the hell?

2384
02:34:53,170 --> 02:34:54,370
What is this decor?

2385
02:34:55,050 --> 02:34:56,370
What is this decor?

2386
02:35:00,540 --> 02:35:01,180
Okay.

2387
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:02,740
Foot secured.

2388
02:35:04,040 --> 02:35:05,420
Why are we here?

2389
02:35:06,760 --> 02:35:07,240
Oh.

2390
02:35:15,810 --> 02:35:17,010
Why are we here?

2391
02:35:17,370 --> 02:35:18,930
Just to suffer, but also...

2392
02:35:21,210 --> 02:35:22,750
Why are we at this location?

2393
02:35:28,520 --> 02:35:29,280
Oh, sorry.

2394
02:35:29,580 --> 02:35:30,440
I wasn't paying attention.

2395
02:35:46,290 --> 02:35:47,710
Destroyed demon gear.

2396
02:35:52,510 --> 02:35:54,510
There's one... There's a couple, I hear them.

2397
02:35:54,810 --> 02:35:55,350
Oh, hello.

2398
02:35:56,750 --> 02:35:57,510
Oh my gosh.

2399
02:36:08,760 --> 02:36:10,360
All I'm doing is shooting.

2400
02:36:29,160 --> 02:36:29,680
Oh!

2401
02:36:30,500 --> 02:36:32,300
He got ahead of me, actually.

2402
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:35,300
Probably because I'm not moving around or doing anything.

2403
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:37,240
I'm just standing there.

2404
02:36:38,600 --> 02:36:40,420
I'm just standing there blasting.

2405
02:36:46,210 --> 02:36:49,230
I like how he spins when he is...

2406
02:36:49,230 --> 02:36:50,850
getting back up though.

2407
02:36:50,890 --> 02:36:51,190
It's fun.

2408
02:36:51,410 --> 02:36:53,150
Oh, that guy was just...

2409
02:36:53,150 --> 02:36:54,690
That guy was also just standing there.

2410
02:36:55,750 --> 02:36:57,050
He's my kindred spirit.

2411
02:37:01,710 --> 02:37:03,650
Oh my gosh, are they ever gonna end?

2412
02:37:26,550 --> 02:37:27,430
Say please.

2413
02:37:27,570 --> 02:37:28,010
Please!

2414
02:37:28,310 --> 02:37:29,270
What am I saying please for?

2415
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:35,640
Oh my gosh, I feel like any second now...

2416
02:37:35,640 --> 02:37:35,820
Oh.

2417
02:37:36,360 --> 02:37:38,420
Any second now we're gonna see some guy...

2418
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:41,620
Who's...

2419
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:43,080
Sneaking, suiting it up.

2420
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:49,010
Is this a cutscene?

2421
02:37:50,270 --> 02:37:50,710
Yes.

2422
02:37:53,050 --> 02:37:54,350
No more, please!

2423
02:37:54,350 --> 02:37:54,630
Please!

2424
02:37:55,310 --> 02:37:56,410
Leave me alone!

2425
02:37:58,170 --> 02:37:59,230
Does this do anything?

2426
02:37:59,450 --> 02:37:59,690
No.

2427
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:20,170
Guys, I don't even have anything to really commentate.

2428
02:38:22,870 --> 02:38:23,830
Derpy Markiplier...

2429
02:38:23,830 --> 02:38:25,190
Crack eyes.

2430
02:38:25,590 --> 02:38:26,330
What's that mean?

2431
02:38:27,730 --> 02:38:29,230
I'm not Markiplier.

2432
02:38:30,170 --> 02:38:32,270
If I was, my brother would be a furry.

2433
02:38:32,950 --> 02:38:33,870
I don't even have a brother.

2434
02:38:39,870 --> 02:38:40,430
Okay.

2435
02:38:43,770 --> 02:38:44,690
Oh my gosh.

2436
02:38:44,910 --> 02:38:45,290
Hello?

2437
02:38:47,590 --> 02:38:48,710
I'm Markiplier.

2438
02:38:56,210 --> 02:38:57,330
Oh gosh!

2439
02:38:57,430 --> 02:39:00,090
Wait, people joked about me falling asleep in this game.

2440
02:39:00,450 --> 02:39:01,930
I didn't think it would be right.

2441
02:39:10,540 --> 02:39:12,160
What the hell is this?

2442
02:39:13,010 --> 02:39:14,080
Oh, he has this thing.

2443
02:39:26,150 --> 02:39:26,770
Alright.

2444
02:39:27,930 --> 02:39:29,070
Let's go upwards?

2445
02:39:29,650 --> 02:39:30,270
Upwards.

2446
02:39:34,260 --> 02:39:35,880
Wait, I can't see.

2447
02:39:36,620 --> 02:39:38,080
Okay, nevermind, we go downwards.

2448
02:39:39,140 --> 02:39:40,100
Hello, Mintiplier.

2449
02:39:41,640 --> 02:39:42,880
Wasn't it up though?

2450
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:44,020
Down then up.

2451
02:39:47,640 --> 02:39:52,380
Oh, I thought it was...

2452
02:39:52,380 --> 02:39:53,580
The golem guy.

2453
02:39:53,980 --> 02:39:54,900
Oh my god!

2454
02:39:56,260 --> 02:39:58,520
I guess if he explodes, we don't get any money.

2455
02:39:58,620 --> 02:39:59,280
That's kind of lame.

2456
02:40:00,720 --> 02:40:03,400
But it blows up the other guys, so that's kind of nice.

2457
02:40:05,020 --> 02:40:06,820
All the way down.

2458
02:40:16,520 --> 02:40:18,760
Are you guys looking forward to the weekend?

2459
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:30,000
Got any weekend plans?

2460
02:40:33,200 --> 02:40:33,980
Oh my god.

2461
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:36,840
Why did that guy jump at me but explode at the same time?

2462
02:40:43,330 --> 02:40:44,970
A robotics competition?

2463
02:40:45,270 --> 02:40:46,630
That sounds so awesome.

2464
02:40:50,630 --> 02:40:52,190
I guess my DT is full.

2465
02:40:56,590 --> 02:40:57,950
Um...

2466
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:06,890
We got it!

2467
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:15,120
And we get a new thing!

2468
02:41:17,660 --> 02:41:20,220
The same cutscene every time.

2469
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:24,360
I'm so sad Dante doesn't talk!

2470
02:41:24,660 --> 02:41:25,640
Speak to us Dante!

2471
02:41:26,040 --> 02:41:28,260
A magic stone with a fierce flame demon.

2472
02:41:29,640 --> 02:41:29,920
Okay.

2473
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:36,040
That made my tummy drop.

2474
02:41:39,680 --> 02:41:42,240
Oh, so I can either do flame or lightning.

2475
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:43,360
Which one is better?

2476
02:41:45,860 --> 02:41:46,880
He doesn't have voice chat.

2477
02:41:47,900 --> 02:41:50,880
MC2 sleep ASMR when you just hear the...

2478
02:41:53,180 --> 02:41:54,140
Of the gun.

2479
02:41:54,660 --> 02:41:55,840
And you're just like...

2480
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:57,240
Music to my ears.

2481
02:41:57,380 --> 02:41:58,440
Oh, I can save here.

2482
02:41:58,860 --> 02:42:00,840
I don't know if it makes a difference, but...

2483
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:01,820
Let's at least try.

2484
02:42:07,700 --> 02:42:08,960
Oh gosh, okay.

2485
02:42:15,400 --> 02:42:17,380
It only affects sword attacks.

2486
02:42:17,460 --> 02:42:17,840
Wait, what?

2487
02:42:17,840 --> 02:42:19,460
Oh, the flame?

2488
02:42:19,720 --> 02:42:20,520
Oh, nevermind then.

2489
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:25,060
This one.

2490
02:42:25,340 --> 02:42:25,800
There we go.

2491
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:31,410
Get some caffeine.

2492
02:42:31,650 --> 02:42:34,250
I'm right after... Actually...

2493
02:42:36,310 --> 02:42:37,770
Let me go out here.

2494
02:42:46,970 --> 02:42:47,870
Oh, okay.

2495
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:49,110
He was just gonna stand there.

2496
02:42:49,810 --> 02:42:50,450
Take it.

2497
02:42:52,090 --> 02:42:54,090
Look, we're getting behind us too!

2498
02:42:54,390 --> 02:42:55,470
That's kind of so awesome!

2499
02:42:57,770 --> 02:42:59,990
Wait, that's kind of so badass.

2500
02:43:00,230 --> 02:43:00,700
I love that.

2501
02:43:10,160 --> 02:43:11,680
Today is the weekend for me.

2502
02:43:12,020 --> 02:43:12,940
Saturday in Australia.

2503
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:13,660
Good morning!

2504
02:43:20,710 --> 02:43:21,710
Oh my gosh.

2505
02:43:24,850 --> 02:43:27,930
Okay, so I've been working on this, like, bookshelf thing.

2506
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:31,310
I talked about it before on stream a couple days ago, but in case you missed...

2507
02:43:32,930 --> 02:43:34,590
I built it on stream before.

2508
02:43:35,810 --> 02:43:38,810
And then, it took a really long time.

2509
02:43:40,970 --> 02:43:41,450
And...

2510
02:43:42,230 --> 02:43:46,170
I hadn't touched it for a really long time until...

2511
02:43:46,170 --> 02:43:48,310
Like, just the other day, and I was building it again.

2512
02:43:48,810 --> 02:43:49,290
More?

2513
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:50,470
Why?

2514
02:43:54,510 --> 02:43:55,470
But, I

2515
02:44:00,870 --> 02:44:03,430
think maybe the rest on stream...

2516
02:44:03,430 --> 02:44:05,330
Because I was like, oh, well...

2517
02:44:06,590 --> 02:44:09,110
I started it on stream, I can finish it on stream.

2518
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:11,130
I can get a lot done and then finish it on stream.

2519
02:44:11,890 --> 02:44:14,830
And I realized, though...

2520
02:44:16,610 --> 02:44:19,330
That there's a little aspect of it...

2521
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:21,610
That I forgot about.

2522
02:44:24,350 --> 02:44:25,390
That is...

2523
02:44:26,770 --> 02:44:30,570
That could potentially exorcise me...

2524
02:44:30,570 --> 02:44:32,310
If I did it on stream.

2525
02:44:33,950 --> 02:44:34,670
And so...

2526
02:44:34,670 --> 02:44:37,670
I was like, oh shoot, well...

2527
02:44:37,670 --> 02:44:38,730
What do I do then?

2528
02:44:46,690 --> 02:44:51,050
Because I wanted to do it on stream, but if I do it on stream, it might exorcise me.

2529
02:44:51,310 --> 02:44:54,630
And I'm a ghost, you know, so I can't have that happen.

2530
02:44:59,620 --> 02:45:00,660
So I don't know!

2531
02:45:01,920 --> 02:45:07,100
I don't know if I'll be able to do it on stream.

2532
02:45:07,860 --> 02:45:14,100
But once I finish it, of course, you know, if I were to do it off stream, of course I would take a picture once I'm done with it, but...

2533
02:45:17,960 --> 02:45:19,260
Sorry, I just wanted to pause it.

2534
02:45:22,060 --> 02:45:23,980
Is he gonna do his famous jump here?

2535
02:45:24,200 --> 02:45:25,440
He will do the jump, right?

2536
02:45:25,960 --> 02:45:27,700
He'll do the jump that I need him to do, right?

2537
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:29,560
He's not gonna just mess it up, right?

2538
02:45:29,860 --> 02:45:31,760
He'll do the jump, right?

2539
02:45:55,080 --> 02:45:55,800
Dante!

2540
02:45:56,820 --> 02:45:58,320
What is his middle name?

2541
02:45:58,680 --> 02:45:59,160
Dante!

2542
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:01,700
Dante!

2543
02:46:04,040 --> 02:46:05,780
Oh, they're just down there.

2544
02:46:07,420 --> 02:46:08,420
I'll let them be.

2545
02:46:12,020 --> 02:46:13,380
Wait, which door do I take?

2546
02:46:13,940 --> 02:46:16,300
Which door do I take?

2547
02:46:16,760 --> 02:46:18,400
There's a door down here.

2548
02:46:18,760 --> 02:46:19,460
Oh gosh!

2549
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:24,780
Dante spart a cry.

2550
02:46:26,300 --> 02:46:26,740
Cry

2551
02:46:35,880 --> 02:46:36,940
on the other end too?

2552
02:46:37,480 --> 02:46:38,640
What are you doing over there?

2553
02:46:45,550 --> 02:46:46,870
We got him mid-air.

2554
02:46:47,530 --> 02:46:48,210
Kind of awesome.

2555
02:46:54,830 --> 02:46:56,110
There's so many of these guys.

2556
02:46:56,210 --> 02:46:57,030
I'm just gonna jump down.

2557
02:46:58,630 --> 02:46:59,090
There we go.

2558
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:06,960
Oh, Vendetta.

2559
02:47:07,540 --> 02:47:09,120
Oh, it's a decorative sword.

2560
02:47:09,200 --> 02:47:10,580
Ok guys, we wouldn't abuse it anyway.

2561
02:47:10,720 --> 02:47:12,200
I was gonna be like, I don't need a sword.

2562
02:47:13,180 --> 02:47:15,640
A decorative sword that is like death's scythe.

2563
02:47:18,980 --> 02:47:20,260
What the hell?

2564
02:47:21,740 --> 02:47:28,220
What is this guy?

2565
02:47:29,700 --> 02:47:30,940
He's so chill.

2566
02:47:33,340 --> 02:47:34,400
He's like, yeah.

2567
02:47:38,480 --> 02:47:41,260
He's like, yeah, I'm practicing my little...

2568
02:47:41,260 --> 02:47:47,020
I'm playing baby Jesus in the upcoming Christmas play at my church.

2569
02:47:47,140 --> 02:47:48,760
So I'm just practicing my part.

2570
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:50,780
I'm being cool Jesus and all.

2571
02:47:53,980 --> 02:47:55,720
He's just being so chill.

2572
02:48:00,010 --> 02:48:03,170
Wait, is this where I came from?

2573
02:48:04,810 --> 02:48:05,790
What the hell is this?

2574
02:48:06,050 --> 02:48:06,650
Oh my gosh.

2575
02:48:07,070 --> 02:48:10,030
This looks like the thing that Danny Phantom goes into.

2576
02:48:10,830 --> 02:48:12,110
And it makes him a ghost.

2577
02:48:14,330 --> 02:48:16,010
He's dead tired.

2578
02:48:20,090 --> 02:48:22,390
Or wait, is this where I came from?

2579
02:48:23,430 --> 02:48:24,530
So what's over here?

2580
02:48:27,970 --> 02:48:29,590
Oh, the door is closed tight.

2581
02:48:30,150 --> 02:48:30,730
Oh, ok.

2582
02:48:30,730 --> 02:48:32,070
Never mind.

2583
02:48:32,410 --> 02:48:33,950
Never mind, I suppose.

2584
02:48:35,150 --> 02:48:36,510
Never mind.

2585
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:37,490
Ok.

2586
02:48:38,890 --> 02:48:40,390
Alright, well we got a sword.

2587
02:48:41,630 --> 02:48:43,730
And let's go to the other...

2588
02:48:48,370 --> 02:48:49,730
Up here?

2589
02:48:54,810 --> 02:48:55,270
Alright.

2590
02:48:59,560 --> 02:49:04,600
I wish I could see any of the roofs that I walk into.

2591
02:49:04,600 --> 02:49:07,620
I feel like it would create much more of an impact where I'm like...

2592
02:49:11,660 --> 02:49:14,380
They don't consider camera angle at all.

2593
02:49:14,640 --> 02:49:16,880
Oh my gosh, is this really Metal Gear, you guys?

2594
02:49:18,860 --> 02:49:21,200
Why am I in Shadow Moses now?

2595
02:49:22,740 --> 02:49:24,880
Oh my god, and I got ambushed.

2596
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:25,920
What is happening?

2597
02:49:31,290 --> 02:49:32,610
This isn't funny.

2598
02:49:34,190 --> 02:49:36,650
They are triggering my brain run.

2599
02:49:36,730 --> 02:49:37,990
Not a good way.

2600
02:49:40,780 --> 02:49:43,000
It's just like the area with the crows.

2601
02:49:52,120 --> 02:49:53,080
I'm ok.

2602
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:54,300
I'm ok.

2603
02:49:55,900 --> 02:49:58,880
Slow ass elevator, my god.

2604
02:49:59,980 --> 02:50:02,040
Prepare to fight Vulcan Raven.

2605
02:50:06,590 --> 02:50:07,450
Close enough.

2606
02:50:21,140 --> 02:50:22,960
Wait, why is it not doing it anymore?

2607
02:50:24,600 --> 02:50:25,640
Calm down.

2608
02:50:27,060 --> 02:50:27,580
Oh,

2609
02:50:34,930 --> 02:50:35,270
there is more.

2610
02:50:40,730 --> 02:50:41,250
Dead.

2611
02:50:42,370 --> 02:50:43,750
And just one more guy.

2612
02:50:46,010 --> 02:50:48,370
The sword is an actual weapon even if it says decorative.

2613
02:50:49,170 --> 02:50:50,250
Wait, seriously?

2614
02:50:52,590 --> 02:50:53,970
No, you're kidding me.

2615
02:50:55,130 --> 02:50:55,770
Why

2616
02:51:04,340 --> 02:51:05,940
did it say decorative?

2617
02:51:06,120 --> 02:51:07,920
I thought it was going to be used for a puzzle.

2618
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:11,120
To open a door or something.

2619
02:51:12,660 --> 02:51:14,400
Oh my god.

2620
02:51:15,740 --> 02:51:18,520
This is the opposite of decorative.

2621
02:51:18,900 --> 02:51:19,920
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2622
02:51:20,320 --> 02:51:23,820
I just hit my desk in frustration.

2623
02:51:24,860 --> 02:51:26,740
Oh my gosh, I'm like...

2624
02:51:26,740 --> 02:51:29,200
I can't with this game.

2625
02:51:30,880 --> 02:51:33,020
Well, I guess I'll equip it.

2626
02:51:34,900 --> 02:51:36,340
Is it big heavy?

2627
02:51:38,560 --> 02:51:40,820
Oh no, it's actually not bad.

2628
02:51:43,300 --> 02:51:46,400
You see, this sword is actually...

2629
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:53,340
I can just see the devs typing that and he's got the biggest troll face on.

2630
02:51:53,480 --> 02:51:55,280
He's just like, you see this sword?

2631
02:51:57,680 --> 02:51:58,800
It's decorative.

2632
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:04,400
Oh my god.

2633
02:52:06,420 --> 02:52:08,880
Someone needs to bust out their dictionary.

2634
02:52:09,160 --> 02:52:10,740
I don't think they know what that meant.

2635
02:52:18,220 --> 02:52:20,380
We're going back to the oil field?

2636
02:52:20,660 --> 02:52:20,740
Wait.

2637
02:52:21,860 --> 02:52:24,120
We're going back to the oil field.

2638
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:26,320
Wait, weren't we...

2639
02:52:26,320 --> 02:52:26,460
Huh?

2640
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:29,920
Wait, what?

2641
02:52:33,080 --> 02:52:34,840
What the dog doing?

2642
02:52:34,920 --> 02:52:36,020
He's just standing there.

2643
02:53:01,430 --> 02:53:02,210
It's gonna blow?

2644
02:53:02,470 --> 02:53:03,270
No, right?

2645
02:53:03,510 --> 02:53:04,930
It's taking us there.

2646
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:09,070
And I'm getting robs at the same time.

2647
02:53:09,710 --> 02:53:11,570
Making money, baby.

2648
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:14,910
Why is there a beep?

2649
02:53:15,110 --> 02:53:17,010
It's like the sound of the...

2650
02:53:17,010 --> 02:53:18,250
It's transporting.

2651
02:53:18,470 --> 02:53:21,210
I don't really quite understand why it's beeping.

2652
02:53:21,890 --> 02:53:22,170
See?

2653
02:53:22,610 --> 02:53:23,670
We're almost there.

2654
02:53:25,810 --> 02:53:26,470
What?

2655
02:53:26,590 --> 02:53:28,070
Why don't you just stand there?

2656
02:53:28,150 --> 02:53:29,690
Why don't the AI do anything?

2657
02:53:31,530 --> 02:53:33,490
My name is Mintiplier.

2658
02:53:35,950 --> 02:53:37,750
I guess we're almost there.

2659
02:53:55,170 --> 02:53:56,150
Thank goodness.

2660
02:54:05,630 --> 02:54:06,390
Nice.

2661
02:54:06,390 --> 02:54:06,730
Nice.

2662
02:54:13,110 --> 02:54:14,630
Another elevator!

2663
02:54:29,090 --> 02:54:31,990
I don't... I don't understand.

2664
02:54:33,010 --> 02:54:34,650
Okay, I don't think there's anything else.

2665
02:54:34,850 --> 02:54:35,070
Why?

2666
02:54:36,350 --> 02:54:37,430
Oh, we're going up!

2667
02:54:42,310 --> 02:54:44,470
I think this game is kind of awesome.

2668
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:46,970
Get it, Dante.

2669
02:54:47,230 --> 02:54:47,890
Don't miss it.

2670
02:54:47,950 --> 02:54:48,150
Dante!

2671
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:51,730
Oh my god!

2672
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:54,330
Dante, don't miss it.

2673
02:54:57,310 --> 02:55:00,010
Just stand in the corner, Dante, and then you'll get all of them.

2674
02:55:08,430 --> 02:55:08,830
Okay.

2675
02:55:10,770 --> 02:55:11,930
Alright, just a moment guys.

2676
02:55:12,030 --> 02:55:13,770
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

2677
02:55:13,990 --> 02:55:14,590
I'm out of tea.

2678
02:55:14,590 --> 02:55:16,550
And I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

2679
02:55:18,150 --> 02:55:22,030
I will be right back.

2680
02:55:23,330 --> 02:55:24,250
Okay.

2681
02:55:24,770 --> 02:55:25,750
Take a break everybody.

2682
02:55:26,490 --> 02:55:27,550
Take a break!

2683
02:55:29,530 --> 02:55:31,190
A little break time.

2684
02:55:31,970 --> 02:55:34,790
I'll see you guys in just a few minutes.

2685
03:00:43,370 --> 03:00:44,290
I'm back.

2686
03:00:45,230 --> 03:00:46,150
Hello everybody.

2687
03:00:46,150 --> 03:00:46,730
Hello.

2688
03:00:48,150 --> 03:00:49,030
Sorry about that.

2689
03:00:49,170 --> 03:00:50,610
Oh my gosh, it was so quiet.

2690
03:00:50,770 --> 03:00:52,270
I didn't even realize there was no music.

2691
03:00:52,850 --> 03:00:53,330
Sorry.

2692
03:00:57,850 --> 03:00:58,330
Sorry.

2693
03:01:00,410 --> 03:01:01,350
I'm back.

2694
03:01:02,010 --> 03:01:03,250
Sorry about that.

2695
03:01:03,670 --> 03:01:04,450
Oh my goodness.

2696
03:01:05,070 --> 03:01:05,910
I didn't even realize.

2697
03:01:07,410 --> 03:01:08,270
Nice and quiet.

2698
03:01:09,370 --> 03:01:10,930
Dante has been talking this whole time?

2699
03:01:11,030 --> 03:01:11,350
I bet.

2700
03:01:11,470 --> 03:01:12,190
I believe it.

2701
03:01:13,830 --> 03:01:14,310
Alrighty.

2702
03:01:14,310 --> 03:01:14,410
Alrighty.

2703
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:18,450
Alright, we just made it back.

2704
03:01:18,950 --> 03:01:19,890
We made it up.

2705
03:01:21,730 --> 03:01:22,750
Which way do we go?

2706
03:01:23,430 --> 03:01:24,350
Can't go that way.

2707
03:01:24,750 --> 03:01:26,030
Can't go that way.

2708
03:01:26,090 --> 03:01:26,930
Only one way to go.

2709
03:01:27,250 --> 03:01:27,930
To the helipad.

2710
03:01:30,190 --> 03:01:31,370
Who is this?

2711
03:01:32,410 --> 03:01:33,690
Oh my god, Dante is gonna talk.

2712
03:01:34,570 --> 03:01:35,530
Dante is gonna say something.

2713
03:01:36,490 --> 03:01:38,430
Oh, is that guy from Tekken?

2714
03:01:39,150 --> 03:01:39,750
Oh.

2715
03:01:55,640 --> 03:01:57,260
Oh my god.

2716
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:00,380
No way.

2717
03:02:02,840 --> 03:02:04,780
I thought that he was gonna be like...

2718
03:02:05,500 --> 03:02:06,400
The guy.

2719
03:02:06,600 --> 03:02:10,780
Oh my gosh, we have ten minutes... Missions left after this one, right?

2720
03:02:11,400 --> 03:02:14,460
The challenger shall rise while the king evades.

2721
03:02:14,460 --> 03:02:15,700
Okay.

2722
03:02:19,640 --> 03:02:21,080
Dante is gonna talk!

2723
03:02:21,440 --> 03:02:22,360
Dante is gonna talk!

2724
03:02:24,180 --> 03:02:24,580
Speak.

2725
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:25,740
Speak boy.

2726
03:02:26,740 --> 03:02:27,500
Say something.

2727
03:02:32,160 --> 03:02:37,160
Oh my god, he can speak.

2728
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:40,440
Maybe another time.

2729
03:02:42,860 --> 03:02:45,760
How did we get all the way here?

2730
03:02:45,860 --> 03:02:46,780
Why are we here?

2731
03:02:46,920 --> 03:02:48,120
What is the purpose?

2732
03:02:56,790 --> 03:02:59,290
Oh, this is your cover breaks up for like eight hours straight?

2733
03:02:59,490 --> 03:02:59,650
Stop!

2734
03:03:08,730 --> 03:03:09,770
Is that all he had?

2735
03:03:09,890 --> 03:03:10,730
That's all he said.

2736
03:03:10,810 --> 03:03:11,370
Oh my god.

2737
03:03:11,950 --> 03:03:14,290
Wait, this guy is way tinier than I thought he was.

2738
03:03:14,610 --> 03:03:16,910
Oh my gosh.

2739
03:03:17,290 --> 03:03:17,710
Get up, Dante.

2740
03:03:18,190 --> 03:03:19,010
Oh, they gave us...

2741
03:03:21,310 --> 03:03:21,710
Aim?

2742
03:03:22,390 --> 03:03:22,750
Aim?

2743
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:31,720
No, that's not where you aim.

2744
03:03:36,970 --> 03:03:38,090
Am I getting pulled in?

2745
03:03:39,670 --> 03:03:40,590
I think so.

2746
03:03:41,850 --> 03:03:42,350
There we go.

2747
03:03:48,280 --> 03:03:50,540
I forgot to get rid of the godfishen!

2748
03:03:51,040 --> 03:03:52,220
Sorry, I went to... Hold on.

2749
03:03:53,640 --> 03:03:54,620
Let me get rid of it.

2750
03:03:54,760 --> 03:03:55,160
There we go.

2751
03:03:55,240 --> 03:03:55,540
Sorry.

2752
03:03:56,660 --> 03:03:57,700
I was still fishing.

2753
03:04:05,050 --> 03:04:06,450
He is doing that again.

2754
03:04:07,290 --> 03:04:08,230
What am I supposed to do?

2755
03:04:08,590 --> 03:04:09,070
Oh my god.

2756
03:04:09,870 --> 03:04:11,670
I don't want to be in the air while he does that.

2757
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:25,280
Do it again.

2758
03:04:25,380 --> 03:04:25,980
I dare you.

2759
03:04:26,760 --> 03:04:27,160
Cool.

2760
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:28,900
I actually don't mind this.

2761
03:04:39,780 --> 03:04:40,980
Okay, cool.

2762
03:04:41,680 --> 03:04:42,940
No way.

2763
03:04:46,780 --> 03:04:51,480
My finger is getting tired from shooting so much.

2764
03:04:55,210 --> 03:04:56,150
No way.

2765
03:04:58,550 --> 03:04:59,750
Furryataurus.

2766
03:05:02,410 --> 03:05:03,990
Oh my god.

2767
03:05:04,930 --> 03:05:05,650
What?

2768
03:05:13,440 --> 03:05:14,580
There we go.

2769
03:05:14,580 --> 03:05:19,060
Oh my god.

2770
03:05:19,780 --> 03:05:20,660
Okay.

2771
03:05:22,300 --> 03:05:23,660
How is the weather?

2772
03:05:24,280 --> 03:05:25,600
It was really nice today.

2773
03:05:26,040 --> 03:05:28,000
I had all my windows open.

2774
03:05:28,980 --> 03:05:30,320
Even though it was cold.

2775
03:05:31,260 --> 03:05:32,140
But...

2776
03:05:32,140 --> 03:05:36,620
It gets kind of hot in my computer room.

2777
03:05:40,380 --> 03:05:42,580
Because of the computer.

2778
03:05:43,260 --> 03:05:45,740
So, I had my windows open.

2779
03:05:45,880 --> 03:05:51,000
And when I do that, my kitties like to sit there and sniff the outdoors.

2780
03:05:51,420 --> 03:05:52,100
It's nice.

2781
03:05:52,640 --> 03:05:53,700
Dante is going to say something.

2782
03:05:55,700 --> 03:05:56,420
Dante!

2783
03:06:14,450 --> 03:06:17,430
He said three lines.

2784
03:06:18,690 --> 03:06:21,690
The hunter will discover the purity of speed.

2785
03:06:23,310 --> 03:06:25,030
Are we in France?

2786
03:06:25,030 --> 03:06:27,170
Oh wait, or is that the oil rig?

2787
03:06:27,310 --> 03:06:27,710
Nevermind.

2788
03:06:28,050 --> 03:06:29,250
Yeah, we are still in the oil rig.

2789
03:06:29,510 --> 03:06:30,430
Here we go.

2790
03:06:31,190 --> 03:06:32,710
The cutscene was longer than the fight.

2791
03:06:33,670 --> 03:06:35,890
Wait, where is all my little stuff?

2792
03:06:36,410 --> 03:06:37,490
You promised a grorb.

2793
03:06:37,630 --> 03:06:39,390
It was there in the fight.

2794
03:06:40,410 --> 03:06:41,310
Just because I didn't...

2795
03:06:41,310 --> 03:06:42,850
And there was a grorb over there.

2796
03:06:42,910 --> 03:06:44,230
Just because I didn't grab them.

2797
03:06:44,550 --> 03:06:47,110
Wait, so we came all the way out here to this oil rig.

2798
03:06:47,150 --> 03:06:48,110
And now we are going to leave, right?

2799
03:06:48,990 --> 03:06:50,290
Is that actually what's happening?

2800
03:06:51,050 --> 03:06:52,470
Is that actually what's going on?

2801
03:06:55,030 --> 03:06:58,170
We can't even explore because there are invisible walls.

2802
03:07:00,990 --> 03:07:01,710
Oh,

2803
03:07:07,010 --> 03:07:09,410
an alert can be heard which means that...

2804
03:07:09,410 --> 03:07:09,650
Sorry.

2805
03:07:11,290 --> 03:07:14,250
That this building may explode at any moment.

2806
03:07:18,690 --> 03:07:19,410
Caution.

2807
03:07:26,850 --> 03:07:27,250
OK.

2808
03:07:32,180 --> 03:07:32,960
Caution.

2809
03:07:33,920 --> 03:07:34,240
OK.

2810
03:07:35,060 --> 03:07:36,040
Oh, shoot.

2811
03:07:39,850 --> 03:07:41,210
I missed the ball!

2812
03:07:50,030 --> 03:07:52,270
Oh my god, it's so blurry.

2813
03:07:53,570 --> 03:07:54,990
Which way do I go?

2814
03:07:55,450 --> 03:07:56,850
This one has roars.

2815
03:07:59,250 --> 03:08:03,030
Which way is the path to take?

2816
03:08:16,710 --> 03:08:17,590
Warning.

2817
03:08:19,230 --> 03:08:20,110
Caution.

2818
03:08:24,870 --> 03:08:25,750
Warning.

2819
03:08:30,550 --> 03:08:31,950
Oh no, our buddy!

2820
03:08:32,810 --> 03:08:33,110
No!

2821
03:08:34,610 --> 03:08:36,830
It was too chill to survive.

2822
03:08:38,550 --> 03:08:39,470
Oh my god.

2823
03:08:40,050 --> 03:08:40,530
I'm leaving.

2824
03:08:40,990 --> 03:08:41,230
Goodbye.

2825
03:08:41,230 --> 03:08:41,330
Goodbye.

2826
03:08:46,050 --> 03:08:46,450
Warning.

2827
03:08:46,930 --> 03:08:47,330
Warning.

2828
03:08:49,010 --> 03:08:51,750
Wait, I have to go up, don't I?

2829
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:01,080
Ouch!

2830
03:09:01,360 --> 03:09:02,680
Oh, I didn't think he'd be able to get me.

2831
03:09:10,490 --> 03:09:12,230
OK, next one I'll just shoot it.

2832
03:09:15,910 --> 03:09:16,310
Warning.

2833
03:09:19,210 --> 03:09:19,610
Caution.

2834
03:09:19,610 --> 03:09:19,970
Warning.

2835
03:09:22,010 --> 03:09:23,010
Oh, shoot.

2836
03:09:23,530 --> 03:09:26,110
There we go.

2837
03:09:26,970 --> 03:09:27,930
Oh, we were so close.

2838
03:09:28,170 --> 03:09:29,190
It's right there.

2839
03:09:30,590 --> 03:09:31,190
Warning.

2840
03:09:33,630 --> 03:09:34,230
Caution.

2841
03:09:34,590 --> 03:09:34,830
OK.

2842
03:09:43,360 --> 03:09:45,140
All the way over there?

2843
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:46,680
And then up?

2844
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:47,500
Oh my god.

2845
03:09:47,660 --> 03:09:48,520
Wait, wait, wait.

2846
03:09:50,120 --> 03:09:50,720
OK.

2847
03:09:51,300 --> 03:09:52,280
I'll try to remember.

2848
03:09:54,720 --> 03:09:55,000
OK.

2849
03:09:59,460 --> 03:10:00,320
All the way up?

2850
03:10:01,520 --> 03:10:03,100
Wait, this thing first?

2851
03:10:03,440 --> 03:10:03,840
Right?

2852
03:10:04,660 --> 03:10:05,560
This thing first?

2853
03:10:05,940 --> 03:10:07,900
Oh, shoot.

2854
03:10:11,710 --> 03:10:13,190
It's so blurry!

2855
03:10:17,500 --> 03:10:18,100
Warning.

2856
03:10:19,560 --> 03:10:20,160
Caution.

2857
03:10:21,100 --> 03:10:21,980
How do I do this?

2858
03:10:22,100 --> 03:10:22,240
Wait.

2859
03:10:23,580 --> 03:10:26,500
It won't let me because I'm aiming at these guys, so...

2860
03:10:26,500 --> 03:10:27,840
It's annoying.

2861
03:10:32,580 --> 03:10:33,120
Caution.

2862
03:10:39,460 --> 03:10:40,620
Not hitting it.

2863
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:41,560
There we go.

2864
03:10:41,800 --> 03:10:42,340
There we go.

2865
03:10:43,000 --> 03:10:43,720
Oh, there's more.

2866
03:10:45,600 --> 03:10:46,140
Somewhere.

2867
03:10:47,120 --> 03:10:47,780
There he is.

2868
03:10:50,220 --> 03:10:51,560
Oh, and there's another, and there's another.

2869
03:10:54,480 --> 03:10:55,020
Please!

2870
03:10:56,620 --> 03:10:57,060
Oh!

2871
03:10:57,480 --> 03:10:58,320
Just die already!

2872
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:02,460
Grab my money at least.

2873
03:11:03,260 --> 03:11:03,980
Oh my god.

2874
03:11:04,140 --> 03:11:04,860
OK, there he is.

2875
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:13,320
Hold RT and R2 to attack without lock-on.

2876
03:11:13,420 --> 03:11:13,840
Oh, really?

2877
03:11:15,700 --> 03:11:16,360
Hold on.

2878
03:11:16,460 --> 03:11:17,500
I think they're almost all dead.

2879
03:11:18,480 --> 03:11:19,360
Thank you though.

2880
03:11:19,500 --> 03:11:20,320
I appreciate it.

2881
03:11:20,640 --> 03:11:21,580
I think we got him.

2882
03:11:22,740 --> 03:11:23,040
OK.

2883
03:11:23,740 --> 03:11:24,600
Take my money.

2884
03:11:26,720 --> 03:11:27,940
Is that the only one?

2885
03:11:32,430 --> 03:11:32,910
Caution.

2886
03:11:34,990 --> 03:11:36,390
That's all we need to do, right?

2887
03:11:37,370 --> 03:11:37,970
There are three?

2888
03:11:38,450 --> 03:11:38,730
Oh.

2889
03:11:39,850 --> 03:11:40,290
OK.

2890
03:11:40,550 --> 03:11:40,710
Wait.

2891
03:11:40,810 --> 03:11:42,350
I think I saw one down here.

2892
03:11:45,490 --> 03:11:46,170
This one.

2893
03:11:46,650 --> 03:11:47,570
Oh, what was it?

2894
03:11:47,630 --> 03:11:47,990
Oh, shoot.

2895
03:11:48,050 --> 03:11:48,610
What did it say?

2896
03:11:49,370 --> 03:11:49,830
Oh my god.

2897
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:51,750
Uh, R2.

2898
03:11:52,830 --> 03:11:53,150
OK.

2899
03:11:53,530 --> 03:11:54,090
Thank you.

2900
03:11:54,770 --> 03:11:55,970
Where's the third one at?

2901
03:11:56,430 --> 03:11:57,650
I only saw two of them.

2902
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:08,160
Oh gosh, I'm stuck.

2903
03:12:09,620 --> 03:12:10,460
Further below.

2904
03:12:10,460 --> 03:12:10,780
OK.

2905
03:12:11,280 --> 03:12:12,240
There's a further below?

2906
03:12:12,520 --> 03:12:12,840
Like here?

2907
03:12:14,320 --> 03:12:15,160
Oh, I see, I see.

2908
03:12:17,240 --> 03:12:17,680
Warning.

2909
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:21,140
Got it.

2910
03:12:23,060 --> 03:12:23,520
Ping pong!

2911
03:12:32,410 --> 03:12:32,850
Nice.

2912
03:12:35,610 --> 03:12:36,050
Dante!

2913
03:12:36,350 --> 03:12:38,410
That's counterproductive for what we're trying to do!

2914
03:12:42,280 --> 03:12:42,840
Oh, no, no, no.

2915
03:12:43,080 --> 03:12:43,440
There we go.

2916
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:44,760
Just keep going, Dante.

2917
03:12:44,760 --> 03:12:45,760
OK.

2918
03:12:48,840 --> 03:12:49,220
OK.

2919
03:12:55,380 --> 03:12:57,180
Up there.

2920
03:12:57,420 --> 03:12:57,700
OK.

2921
03:12:59,620 --> 03:13:00,620
Up there.

2922
03:13:03,580 --> 03:13:04,180
No!

2923
03:13:04,980 --> 03:13:05,560
No!

2924
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:07,260
These guys are the worst!

2925
03:13:08,100 --> 03:13:08,660
OK.

2926
03:13:09,120 --> 03:13:09,580
Nevermind.

2927
03:13:23,650 --> 03:13:24,070
OK.

2928
03:13:27,810 --> 03:13:29,070
There's a whole plane?

2929
03:13:31,370 --> 03:13:32,210
Oh, it's...

2930
03:13:32,210 --> 03:13:32,710
What the hell?

2931
03:13:33,290 --> 03:13:34,830
Oh my god, I'm getting sucked into this.

2932
03:13:34,950 --> 03:13:35,430
Oh my gosh.

2933
03:13:40,040 --> 03:13:40,900
To the plane!

2934
03:13:42,120 --> 03:13:42,880
I think...

2935
03:13:42,880 --> 03:13:43,280
Oh, inside.

2936
03:13:44,220 --> 03:13:44,760
I made it.

2937
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:47,380
I'm too good at this game.

2938
03:13:55,180 --> 03:13:55,600
Wait.

2939
03:13:56,960 --> 03:13:58,200
Wait, is this not their target?

2940
03:13:59,420 --> 03:14:00,220
I got a...

2941
03:14:00,220 --> 03:14:01,800
I got a missile launcher!

2942
03:14:04,820 --> 03:14:08,420
Where am I supposed to go?

2943
03:14:08,900 --> 03:14:10,720
Is the plane not the obvious answer?

2944
03:14:13,360 --> 03:14:14,640
To the...

2945
03:14:18,860 --> 03:14:20,640
What does that mean?

2946
03:14:22,880 --> 03:14:24,620
What does that mean?

2947
03:14:26,740 --> 03:14:28,560
What does this mean?

2948
03:14:32,480 --> 03:14:33,580
Oh, there we go.

2949
03:14:34,700 --> 03:14:35,420
I made it.

2950
03:14:35,780 --> 03:14:36,700
On our...

2951
03:14:36,700 --> 03:14:37,260
Bike...

2952
03:14:37,260 --> 03:14:37,480
Wait.

2953
03:14:37,880 --> 03:14:39,380
But this is in the middle of the ocean.

2954
03:14:40,360 --> 03:14:42,000
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

2955
03:14:42,360 --> 03:14:46,220
We had to literally take a thing that went under the water to get here.

2956
03:14:46,660 --> 03:14:47,020
What?

2957
03:14:47,620 --> 03:14:50,220
Why didn't we just drive!?

2958
03:15:00,810 --> 03:15:03,930
If we could drive, why didn't we?

2959
03:15:07,830 --> 03:15:09,790
That doesn't make any sense.

2960
03:15:14,130 --> 03:15:18,510
Two lights will open the sealed door and guide the hunter to the deep underground.

2961
03:15:20,210 --> 03:15:20,570
What's...

2962
03:15:20,570 --> 03:15:21,810
How many robes are we at?

2963
03:15:22,650 --> 03:15:23,770
Twelve thousand.

2964
03:15:24,050 --> 03:15:24,410
Okay.

2965
03:15:24,410 --> 03:15:24,550
Okay.

2966
03:15:24,750 --> 03:15:27,350
We got a missile launcher too.

2967
03:15:27,550 --> 03:15:28,170
Not bad.

2968
03:15:31,410 --> 03:15:32,050
Yeah.

2969
03:15:34,150 --> 03:15:34,870
Let's go.

2970
03:15:35,070 --> 03:15:35,990
Don't question the vision.

2971
03:15:36,290 --> 03:15:36,610
Sorry.

2972
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:40,490
Now this is looking quite...

2973
03:15:40,490 --> 03:15:43,130
This is looking devil may cry.

2974
03:15:45,250 --> 03:15:47,870
This is looking familiar territory.

2975
03:15:49,950 --> 03:15:51,770
Where were all those robes?

2976
03:15:52,170 --> 03:15:53,110
I saw them all.

2977
03:15:54,410 --> 03:15:56,590
What the hell is this music?

2978
03:15:58,590 --> 03:15:59,930
Don't let it fool you.

2979
03:16:01,510 --> 03:16:03,450
Don't get excited now, Minto.

2980
03:16:04,770 --> 03:16:06,170
It's all a ruse.

2981
03:16:19,100 --> 03:16:20,220
Not yet.

2982
03:16:34,140 --> 03:16:36,660
Turn it down just a little bit more.

2983
03:16:38,100 --> 03:16:39,680
Hope you guys don't mind.

2984
03:16:46,380 --> 03:16:47,720
Flare pie romances.

2985
03:16:48,980 --> 03:16:51,440
I like learning the names of enemies.

2986
03:16:52,140 --> 03:16:55,800
Oh my gosh, the robes don't last for any amount of time.

2987
03:16:56,240 --> 03:16:56,820
It's crazy.

2988
03:16:59,380 --> 03:17:02,980
But I do appreciate that they have like...

2989
03:17:02,980 --> 03:17:04,300
That, at least.

2990
03:17:04,800 --> 03:17:07,020
To know the names of enemies and stuff.

2991
03:17:07,060 --> 03:17:08,800
It's always fun for me.

2992
03:17:09,700 --> 03:17:12,780
Even though I end up always giving them their own names anyway.

2993
03:17:12,940 --> 03:17:15,220
Because I can't remember what their official titles are.

2994
03:17:18,180 --> 03:17:20,640
Just, you know, how it goes.

2995
03:17:26,840 --> 03:17:28,220
Oh, thought he worked.

2996
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:32,220
If you do...

2997
03:17:32,220 --> 03:17:37,220
I think if you do the Lucia missions, you get more of the story and a better idea as to why Dante is there.

2998
03:17:37,780 --> 03:17:39,160
Oh, that's kind of silly, right?

2999
03:17:39,160 --> 03:17:39,340
Okay.

3000
03:17:39,960 --> 03:17:41,540
Why do I have to do her missions?

3001
03:17:41,800 --> 03:17:43,340
To know why this guy...

3002
03:17:43,980 --> 03:17:45,320
I'm playing as Dante.

3003
03:17:46,100 --> 03:17:48,480
Shouldn't Dante know why Dante is there?

3004
03:17:54,600 --> 03:17:55,120
Okay.

3005
03:17:55,540 --> 03:17:57,500
Let's just start doing these then.

3006
03:18:18,740 --> 03:18:20,100
Oh, I've never seen that attack.

3007
03:18:20,200 --> 03:18:22,060
Oh, these are auro-mances.

3008
03:18:22,720 --> 03:18:24,380
Of course I've never seen any attack.

3009
03:18:24,380 --> 03:18:26,740
I'm just always blasting.

3010
03:18:28,380 --> 03:18:29,020
Oh, hello.

3011
03:18:29,560 --> 03:18:32,700
Where was that line of orbs?

3012
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:34,020
I was just trying to find it.

3013
03:18:45,220 --> 03:18:46,980
I don't get it.

3014
03:18:48,920 --> 03:18:49,980
Are you okay, buddy?

3015
03:18:52,800 --> 03:18:53,560
You alright?

3016
03:18:55,620 --> 03:18:56,720
Oh, is there one more?

3017
03:19:01,760 --> 03:19:02,960
Pondering my orb.

3018
03:19:05,700 --> 03:19:06,960
Rocket launcher him?

3019
03:19:07,100 --> 03:19:08,080
Oh, you're right.

3020
03:19:13,250 --> 03:19:16,130
Oh, but it doesn't even do it in one shot.

3021
03:19:18,410 --> 03:19:19,230
Oh my god.

3022
03:19:25,160 --> 03:19:26,720
It just makes him back up.

3023
03:19:47,180 --> 03:19:49,320
Are those lyrics or something?

3024
03:19:52,340 --> 03:19:53,720
We gotta level it up.

3025
03:19:56,560 --> 03:19:57,800
Where's the last one?

3026
03:19:57,880 --> 03:19:58,720
Am I missing it?

3027
03:19:58,880 --> 03:20:01,020
Obviously I'm missing it, but where could it be?

3028
03:20:01,800 --> 03:20:02,600
Where is it?

3029
03:20:02,620 --> 03:20:04,360
I'm missing it somewhere.

3030
03:20:09,400 --> 03:20:10,900
Where are you?

3031
03:20:11,040 --> 03:20:11,560
Okay, hold on.

3032
03:20:11,600 --> 03:20:12,640
I'm just gonna look for it.

3033
03:20:16,380 --> 03:20:17,520
It's a timed puzzle?

3034
03:20:20,600 --> 03:20:21,480
That's why.

3035
03:20:23,060 --> 03:20:24,300
Onix, it's your birthday!

3036
03:20:25,640 --> 03:20:26,600
Happy birthday!

3037
03:20:27,480 --> 03:20:28,400
Hold on, give me one second.

3038
03:20:32,770 --> 03:20:33,950
No, leave me alone!

3039
03:20:39,620 --> 03:20:40,520
No, no, no.

3040
03:20:40,800 --> 03:20:41,920
There we go.

3041
03:20:46,280 --> 03:20:47,580
Onix, remind me though.

3042
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:49,200
Remind me to sing a happy birthday, okay?

3043
03:20:49,800 --> 03:20:50,760
Please remind me.

3044
03:20:50,920 --> 03:20:51,820
Someone remind me.

3045
03:20:54,540 --> 03:20:56,140
Oh my god, please turn around.

3046
03:20:56,660 --> 03:20:56,900
Dante.

3047
03:20:58,600 --> 03:20:59,920
I'm gonna...

3048
03:21:06,310 --> 03:21:06,960
Oh my god.

3049
03:21:09,800 --> 03:21:11,760
How fast do I have to be?

3050
03:21:17,010 --> 03:21:18,770
Okay, we did it.

3051
03:21:19,290 --> 03:21:20,010
We did it.

3052
03:21:20,010 --> 03:21:24,730
Happy birthday to you!

3053
03:21:25,290 --> 03:21:28,990
Happy birthday to you!

3054
03:21:29,830 --> 03:21:33,530
Happy birthday, Onixwing!

3055
03:21:36,390 --> 03:21:42,270
Happy birthday to you!

3056
03:21:44,890 --> 03:21:46,550
Happy birthday!

3057
03:21:46,550 --> 03:21:46,810
Dante!

3058
03:21:53,670 --> 03:21:54,930
Into the hole.

3059
03:21:56,150 --> 03:21:56,850
Nevermind.

3060
03:21:57,950 --> 03:21:58,710
I

3061
03:22:20,430 --> 03:22:21,850
don't want him to heal.

3062
03:22:26,350 --> 03:22:27,650
What is this?

3063
03:22:30,270 --> 03:22:31,810
Oh he already healed.

3064
03:22:32,130 --> 03:22:32,530
This sucks.

3065
03:22:38,220 --> 03:22:39,740
DT and Blast them all?

3066
03:22:39,780 --> 03:22:40,160
So true.

3067
03:22:43,600 --> 03:22:44,780
So true.

3068
03:22:47,100 --> 03:22:48,660
DT baby!

3069
03:22:50,280 --> 03:22:55,060
He is just a little crabby guy now.

3070
03:22:57,680 --> 03:22:59,280
Can I have the carbs?

3071
03:23:02,700 --> 03:23:07,140
I should have saved my DT for Mothra.

3072
03:23:08,430 --> 03:23:10,300
Oh my god, this has a face.

3073
03:23:13,080 --> 03:23:14,160
Say anything!

3074
03:23:19,030 --> 03:23:19,570
What?

3075
03:23:26,280 --> 03:23:27,630
Is that it's baby?

3076
03:23:29,990 --> 03:23:31,470
No, it's part of him.

3077
03:23:42,490 --> 03:23:44,650
I think it's... No, it's not part of him.

3078
03:23:45,110 --> 03:23:45,470
Oh my god.

3079
03:23:49,630 --> 03:23:50,610
Get me out!

3080
03:23:50,790 --> 03:23:51,750
I'm getting bored!

3081
03:23:52,370 --> 03:23:53,210
Oh my

3082
03:23:57,750 --> 03:24:00,030
god, that took so much of my damage.

3083
03:24:00,250 --> 03:24:01,450
Oh my health!

3084
03:24:10,930 --> 03:24:11,970
Grab more health.

3085
03:24:14,090 --> 03:24:14,650
Corb.

3086
03:24:17,190 --> 03:24:17,750
Okay.

3087
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:19,470
Oh my gosh.

3088
03:24:19,650 --> 03:24:21,630
How do I switch?

3089
03:24:24,650 --> 03:24:27,050
How do I... Oh god, please leave me alone.

3090
03:24:27,170 --> 03:24:28,710
How do I switch to...

3091
03:24:38,130 --> 03:24:40,470
Wait, am I on...

3092
03:24:42,490 --> 03:24:42,950
Yeah.

3093
03:25:00,070 --> 03:25:00,730
Oh my god.

3094
03:25:07,220 --> 03:25:09,340
I'm smashing Y, I promise!

3095
03:25:10,160 --> 03:25:12,360
Oh my gosh, this sucks.

3096
03:25:17,400 --> 03:25:18,140
There we go.

3097
03:25:26,990 --> 03:25:27,910
No, please!

3098
03:25:29,130 --> 03:25:31,090
Dante, you have to...

3099
03:25:43,100 --> 03:25:45,020
No, I don't care about that guy.

3100
03:25:45,160 --> 03:25:45,920
Leave him alone.

3101
03:25:46,600 --> 03:25:47,920
We just have to dodge him.

3102
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:49,620
There we go, there we go, there we go.

3103
03:25:51,860 --> 03:25:53,480
Never understood how to escape.

3104
03:25:54,500 --> 03:25:56,160
Seriously, there's like no way.

3105
03:25:57,780 --> 03:26:00,100
No good way at least, like...

3106
03:26:01,340 --> 03:26:02,120
Oh my gosh.

3107
03:26:08,570 --> 03:26:11,150
I wish I could... I wish I could shoot.

3108
03:26:12,810 --> 03:26:13,210
No.

3109
03:26:18,510 --> 03:26:19,410
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3110
03:26:23,340 --> 03:26:25,300
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3111
03:26:25,700 --> 03:26:26,080
Okay.

3112
03:26:26,380 --> 03:26:27,820
Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot.

3113
03:26:28,400 --> 03:26:31,680
Okay, now I'm gonna fly, fly, fly and attack.

3114
03:26:36,330 --> 03:26:37,570
No, fly and attack.

3115
03:26:40,770 --> 03:26:42,890
Okay, that did a lot though.

3116
03:26:43,570 --> 03:26:45,750
So I think we're almost there, we're almost there.

3117
03:26:47,970 --> 03:26:48,950
Okay, oh, whoops.

3118
03:26:49,130 --> 03:26:50,190
I need to...

3119
03:26:50,190 --> 03:26:51,070
Only single attack.

3120
03:26:53,310 --> 03:26:54,130
And jump.

3121
03:26:54,650 --> 03:26:55,650
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

3122
03:26:58,090 --> 03:26:59,190
Oh my god.

3123
03:26:59,850 --> 03:27:00,370
Okay.

3124
03:27:01,990 --> 03:27:02,510
Wait.

3125
03:27:03,650 --> 03:27:05,490
I have to defeat the larva.

3126
03:27:07,090 --> 03:27:07,490
Wait.

3127
03:27:08,710 --> 03:27:11,150
No, switch attack, switch please.

3128
03:27:12,710 --> 03:27:13,530
This thing?

3129
03:27:15,130 --> 03:27:16,090
Oh my god, please.

3130
03:27:16,850 --> 03:27:17,290
Oh my god.

3131
03:27:18,130 --> 03:27:19,150
Wait, which larva?

3132
03:27:19,350 --> 03:27:19,850
Oh gosh.

3133
03:27:20,430 --> 03:27:21,650
What, what, what, what, what?

3134
03:27:23,150 --> 03:27:24,210
Oh my god, please.

3135
03:27:25,730 --> 03:27:26,630
Oh, okay, this thing.

3136
03:27:28,470 --> 03:27:29,910
Oh my god, jump, jump, jump, jump.

3137
03:27:30,730 --> 03:27:32,490
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.

3138
03:27:32,770 --> 03:27:33,370
Oh my gosh.

3139
03:27:36,310 --> 03:27:38,650
I'm gonna go back to... Oh my god.

3140
03:27:40,530 --> 03:27:42,290
I get more air time with these.

3141
03:27:45,750 --> 03:27:48,050
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

3142
03:27:54,530 --> 03:27:57,530
Why aren't you...

3143
03:27:59,270 --> 03:27:59,910
Why aren't you...

3144
03:27:59,910 --> 03:28:03,970
Okay, I think I just got one of them.

3145
03:28:04,430 --> 03:28:05,050
Maybe.

3146
03:28:05,370 --> 03:28:05,970
Yeah, yeah.

3147
03:28:06,030 --> 03:28:06,670
Nice, nice.

3148
03:28:07,430 --> 03:28:08,350
Oh, there's more!

3149
03:28:09,070 --> 03:28:10,670
How many are there?

3150
03:28:11,110 --> 03:28:11,810
No way.

3151
03:28:12,290 --> 03:28:13,590
How many are there?

3152
03:28:21,610 --> 03:28:22,410
Why are there...

3153
03:28:28,950 --> 03:28:29,450
Okay.

3154
03:28:30,510 --> 03:28:32,250
Maybe this guy is the last.

3155
03:28:32,370 --> 03:28:33,410
Nope, maybe not.

3156
03:28:34,630 --> 03:28:36,610
Oh, he gave grorbs.

3157
03:28:39,110 --> 03:28:40,430
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3158
03:28:40,550 --> 03:28:40,710
Okay.

3159
03:28:41,110 --> 03:28:42,150
Feeling better?

3160
03:28:42,710 --> 03:28:43,670
Feeling better now?

3161
03:28:47,030 --> 03:28:47,570
Okay.

3162
03:28:48,970 --> 03:28:50,490
That was close.

3163
03:28:51,110 --> 03:28:52,270
That was close!

3164
03:28:53,930 --> 03:28:55,610
That was so close.

3165
03:28:56,810 --> 03:28:59,890
I'm gonna try and DT...

3166
03:28:59,890 --> 03:29:00,670
Oh, no.

3167
03:29:06,440 --> 03:29:08,700
Oh my god, there's still more?

3168
03:29:11,460 --> 03:29:12,920
How many are there?

3169
03:29:13,040 --> 03:29:14,400
How many are there?

3170
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:17,380
Is there a mechanic she's missing?

3171
03:29:17,520 --> 03:29:18,300
I have no...

3172
03:29:18,300 --> 03:29:19,000
Oh, shit.

3173
03:29:19,520 --> 03:29:20,460
No, no, no, no, no.

3174
03:29:20,600 --> 03:29:22,060
No, DT doesn't work.

3175
03:29:22,180 --> 03:29:22,700
No, no.

3176
03:29:23,040 --> 03:29:23,820
Melee doesn't work.

3177
03:29:23,880 --> 03:29:24,660
Nothing works!

3178
03:29:25,240 --> 03:29:25,800
No!

3179
03:29:34,430 --> 03:29:36,570
Okay, this might actually be the last guy.

3180
03:29:38,730 --> 03:29:41,290
Okay, this might actually be...

3181
03:29:41,290 --> 03:29:42,130
Our final guy.

3182
03:29:48,720 --> 03:29:49,180
Okay.

3183
03:29:49,960 --> 03:29:50,300
Alright.

3184
03:29:52,320 --> 03:29:52,840
Sorry.

3185
03:29:54,720 --> 03:29:57,200
I can't tell their pattern at all.

3186
03:29:57,480 --> 03:29:59,360
When they're gonna, like, come at me like that.

3187
03:30:10,430 --> 03:30:11,470
Oh, god.

3188
03:30:11,470 --> 03:30:14,310
That was hellish.

3189
03:30:14,730 --> 03:30:16,070
Oh my god.

3190
03:30:18,570 --> 03:30:21,090
Oh my god, I didn't even get to go in...

3191
03:30:21,090 --> 03:30:23,050
I didn't even get to go in the hole!

3192
03:30:31,910 --> 03:30:32,310
Dads!

3193
03:30:44,430 --> 03:30:44,950
Sorry,

3194
03:30:53,230 --> 03:30:55,090
the music made me think I have a cat in my room.

3195
03:30:56,570 --> 03:30:56,990
Okay.

3196
03:30:57,990 --> 03:30:59,270
We have eight more...

3197
03:30:59,270 --> 03:31:00,150
Oh, seven!

3198
03:31:00,890 --> 03:31:01,950
Seven more missions.

3199
03:31:02,090 --> 03:31:02,390
Yay!

3200
03:31:04,530 --> 03:31:07,630
He wields a spear and is obeyed by the wolves.

3201
03:31:08,130 --> 03:31:10,190
His single eye possesses knowledge and hate.

3202
03:31:10,690 --> 03:31:12,590
He is the one who brings misfortune.

3203
03:31:13,390 --> 03:31:15,270
How many orbs I got?

3204
03:31:16,410 --> 03:31:16,770
Okay.

3205
03:31:18,430 --> 03:31:19,030
Alright.

3206
03:31:19,890 --> 03:31:20,850
We're fine.

3207
03:31:21,330 --> 03:31:23,710
I wonder...

3208
03:31:23,710 --> 03:31:26,090
Oh, orb is ten thousand?

3209
03:31:26,310 --> 03:31:27,190
No, I'm not gonna.

3210
03:31:28,330 --> 03:31:29,350
Alright, here we go.

3211
03:31:33,490 --> 03:31:34,090
Wow.

3212
03:31:34,910 --> 03:31:35,970
Am I going down to hell?

3213
03:31:36,510 --> 03:31:37,010
Again?

3214
03:31:39,770 --> 03:31:41,270
10k is really expensive.

3215
03:31:41,410 --> 03:31:42,050
I know!

3216
03:31:42,050 --> 03:31:45,350
Why they up the price so much in this?

3217
03:31:49,710 --> 03:31:51,270
Level one?

3218
03:32:00,120 --> 03:32:00,640
Okay.

3219
03:32:01,440 --> 03:32:02,480
Alright.

3220
03:32:03,200 --> 03:32:04,060
I'll do it.

3221
03:32:07,530 --> 03:32:07,790
Okay.

3222
03:32:08,590 --> 03:32:08,870
Okay.

3223
03:32:09,670 --> 03:32:10,190
Alright.

3224
03:32:10,990 --> 03:32:11,430
Okay.

3225
03:32:13,570 --> 03:32:14,230
Sure.

3226
03:32:15,630 --> 03:32:16,410
Secret room.

3227
03:32:16,470 --> 03:32:18,170
I thought that was an obvious door.

3228
03:32:20,490 --> 03:32:22,590
Like I thought that was...

3229
03:32:24,350 --> 03:32:25,170
Oh, wait.

3230
03:32:25,570 --> 03:32:26,610
These are the same guys?

3231
03:32:45,450 --> 03:32:45,790
Okay.

3232
03:32:46,250 --> 03:32:47,870
Gives you some extra orb fragments.

3233
03:32:47,990 --> 03:32:48,330
Let's go.

3234
03:32:48,850 --> 03:32:49,750
Yeah, why not?

3235
03:32:49,930 --> 03:32:51,150
It's easy enough, right?

3236
03:32:51,370 --> 03:32:53,250
Okay, these guys are so lame.

3237
03:32:53,330 --> 03:32:54,010
I swear.

3238
03:32:55,090 --> 03:32:58,070
These guys are so actually lame.

3239
03:33:07,410 --> 03:33:08,410
Wait, so...

3240
03:33:08,410 --> 03:33:09,810
Secret rooms...

3241
03:33:09,810 --> 03:33:11,170
Oh, wow!

3242
03:33:13,470 --> 03:33:15,070
Complete a secret mission.

3243
03:33:15,370 --> 03:33:15,870
Nice.

3244
03:33:17,170 --> 03:33:18,330
Look at us, guys.

3245
03:33:20,630 --> 03:33:21,630
So, you...

3246
03:33:21,630 --> 03:33:24,300
Like, if I were to have found the other ones in the other areas...

3247
03:33:24,830 --> 03:33:26,110
It would have been like level...

3248
03:33:26,810 --> 03:33:28,650
Like seven or whatever, you know?

3249
03:33:32,630 --> 03:33:33,550
What are these?

3250
03:33:34,310 --> 03:33:35,270
Oh, okay.

3251
03:33:36,130 --> 03:33:37,370
More of you guys.

3252
03:33:37,530 --> 03:33:38,550
More of you guys.

3253
03:33:38,550 --> 03:33:39,090
There's more...

3254
03:33:39,090 --> 03:33:40,850
That guy is just standing over here.

3255
03:33:40,990 --> 03:33:42,330
Okay, he finally makes a move.

3256
03:33:48,150 --> 03:33:50,290
He's finally doing something.

3257
03:33:55,690 --> 03:33:56,130
Okay.

3258
03:33:56,390 --> 03:33:57,030
Don't worry.

3259
03:33:57,650 --> 03:33:59,410
It says don't worry, but I'm honestly...

3260
03:33:59,410 --> 03:34:00,450
I'm so unfazed.

3261
03:34:00,890 --> 03:34:02,190
I'm so unbothered.

3262
03:34:02,930 --> 03:34:04,650
Like, these guys don't even talk to me.

3263
03:34:05,510 --> 03:34:06,550
It's so easy.

3264
03:34:07,170 --> 03:34:07,910
Let's just...

3265
03:34:07,910 --> 03:34:09,150
Oh, I don't even have to look.

3266
03:34:09,390 --> 03:34:11,230
Oh, I was shooting him into space.

3267
03:34:11,230 --> 03:34:14,150
This floor design is...

3268
03:34:14,150 --> 03:34:14,910
Oh, god!

3269
03:34:16,830 --> 03:34:17,350
Goatling?

3270
03:34:17,670 --> 03:34:18,350
Oh, god!

3271
03:34:27,650 --> 03:34:29,050
Okay, now I'm a little bothered.

3272
03:34:29,810 --> 03:34:31,010
Home decor is my passion.

3273
03:34:31,190 --> 03:34:33,710
Everything is just those horrible ugly tiles.

3274
03:34:40,850 --> 03:34:42,070
They're almost dead, though.

3275
03:34:43,490 --> 03:34:45,070
Come on, just a little bit more.

3276
03:34:45,910 --> 03:34:46,530
You know what?

3277
03:34:48,490 --> 03:34:49,430
There we go.

3278
03:34:52,430 --> 03:34:53,470
I did not...

3279
03:34:53,470 --> 03:34:53,850
There we go.

3280
03:34:54,030 --> 03:34:55,810
I'm not used to having a...

3281
03:34:55,810 --> 03:34:57,410
A rocket launcher.

3282
03:34:59,150 --> 03:34:59,710
Wow!

3283
03:35:00,050 --> 03:35:02,070
This is truly a DIY...

3284
03:35:06,290 --> 03:35:07,410
Home renovation.

3285
03:35:08,690 --> 03:35:10,910
They're going wild on the tile.

3286
03:35:11,050 --> 03:35:11,570
Oh, no!

3287
03:35:11,670 --> 03:35:13,150
We're getting sealed in!

3288
03:35:16,790 --> 03:35:17,250
Crap.

3289
03:35:17,390 --> 03:35:18,810
Oh, that's not what I wanted.

3290
03:35:22,630 --> 03:35:23,950
Okay, I'm just gonna...

3291
03:35:23,950 --> 03:35:25,230
Oh, that's not what I meant either.

3292
03:35:26,830 --> 03:35:28,050
That's not what I wanted.

3293
03:35:30,990 --> 03:35:32,690
Wait, I want to get this thing.

3294
03:35:33,450 --> 03:35:34,170
Okay, nevermind.

3295
03:35:38,190 --> 03:35:39,090
Fly, froggy!

3296
03:35:39,170 --> 03:35:39,450
Fly!

3297
03:35:42,010 --> 03:35:42,870
More fry!

3298
03:35:42,870 --> 03:35:43,070
Fly!

3299
03:35:47,010 --> 03:35:48,890
Hidden machine gun is located in...

3300
03:35:48,890 --> 03:35:49,070
Oh!

3301
03:35:51,850 --> 03:35:52,990
Hidden machine gun.

3302
03:35:53,090 --> 03:35:54,730
Will you help me get that?

3303
03:35:54,930 --> 03:35:55,570
As long as I...

3304
03:35:55,570 --> 03:35:56,430
I don't want to miss it.

3305
03:35:57,390 --> 03:35:58,570
I don't want to make...

3306
03:35:58,570 --> 03:35:59,510
I want to make sure.

3307
03:36:00,910 --> 03:36:01,070
Oh.

3308
03:36:03,090 --> 03:36:03,910
No, help!

3309
03:36:04,590 --> 03:36:05,910
They helped me with the...

3310
03:36:05,910 --> 03:36:07,490
With saying it was even there at all.

3311
03:36:10,110 --> 03:36:12,070
He, like, always leaves them on 1 HP.

3312
03:36:12,250 --> 03:36:12,710
Oh, just kidding.

3313
03:36:12,930 --> 03:36:13,630
Nevermind, I got him.

3314
03:36:14,950 --> 03:36:16,270
How many are there?

3315
03:36:16,690 --> 03:36:17,790
Freaking frogs!

3316
03:36:18,370 --> 03:36:19,390
The frogs!

3317
03:36:26,950 --> 03:36:28,790
You want to see me use my sword more?

3318
03:36:28,890 --> 03:36:29,570
I can do that.

3319
03:36:30,430 --> 03:36:31,410
Said no one ever.

3320
03:36:34,370 --> 03:36:36,430
Who wants me to use my sword more?

3321
03:36:39,910 --> 03:36:40,930
Okay, so here...

3322
03:36:43,410 --> 03:36:45,310
Oh, that doesn't look...

3323
03:36:45,310 --> 03:36:45,930
Okay, hold on.

3324
03:36:49,830 --> 03:36:50,990
Um...

3325
03:36:52,790 --> 03:36:53,490
Uh...

3326
03:36:57,970 --> 03:36:59,090
More in here.

3327
03:37:01,530 --> 03:37:02,310
Uh...

3328
03:37:02,930 --> 03:37:04,650
What...

3329
03:37:04,650 --> 03:37:05,310
Room?

3330
03:37:11,810 --> 03:37:13,210
Um...

3331
03:37:15,920 --> 03:37:16,840
This room?

3332
03:37:21,470 --> 03:37:23,010
I can...

3333
03:37:24,010 --> 03:37:25,650
Have rewarded me.

3334
03:37:26,810 --> 03:37:28,750
Said good job, Minto.

3335
03:37:29,550 --> 03:37:30,690
You discovered.

3336
03:37:32,690 --> 03:37:33,910
The extra orbs.

3337
03:37:40,540 --> 03:37:41,860
Okay, in here.

3338
03:37:42,380 --> 03:37:43,300
Extra orbs?

3339
03:37:43,440 --> 03:37:43,580
None.

3340
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:48,540
We reward your...

3341
03:37:50,520 --> 03:37:51,600
In here.

3342
03:37:52,000 --> 03:37:53,400
Okay, okay, hold on.

3343
03:37:53,500 --> 03:37:56,180
I'm going in every damn little tiny window.

3344
03:37:58,360 --> 03:37:58,640
No!

3345
03:37:59,280 --> 03:38:01,520
We reward your...

3346
03:38:03,040 --> 03:38:03,700
Tenacity.

3347
03:38:05,260 --> 03:38:05,680
And...

3348
03:38:06,100 --> 03:38:06,940
Um...

3349
03:38:09,720 --> 03:38:11,360
And your...

3350
03:38:12,780 --> 03:38:14,760
Ability to explore.

3351
03:38:15,700 --> 03:38:16,660
I think you missed one.

3352
03:38:17,160 --> 03:38:19,040
But it didn't look like anything was in there.

3353
03:38:24,310 --> 03:38:26,550
Is there actually anything in there?

3354
03:38:34,600 --> 03:38:35,420
Please.

3355
03:38:36,400 --> 03:38:36,740
Dante.

3356
03:38:37,180 --> 03:38:37,600
Dante!

3357
03:38:42,620 --> 03:38:43,440
Dante!

3358
03:38:43,440 --> 03:38:43,700
Dante!

3359
03:38:47,360 --> 03:38:49,380
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna find the machine gun...

3360
03:38:49,380 --> 03:38:50,940
Unless anybody tells me where it's at.

3361
03:38:52,040 --> 03:38:53,200
I have no idea.

3362
03:39:06,130 --> 03:39:06,610
Cool.

3363
03:39:14,310 --> 03:39:14,670
Thank you.

3364
03:39:24,640 --> 03:39:27,060
These things, I wish they were like the bats...

3365
03:39:27,060 --> 03:39:28,100
And had...

3366
03:39:28,100 --> 03:39:30,100
Like could be killed in one shot.

3367
03:39:31,920 --> 03:39:33,520
Instead they're actual enemies.

3368
03:39:33,700 --> 03:39:34,140
I hate that.

3369
03:39:39,270 --> 03:39:39,750
Oh.

3370
03:39:46,590 --> 03:39:47,410
No help?

3371
03:39:47,530 --> 03:39:47,930
Okay then.

3372
03:39:48,010 --> 03:39:48,750
I just won't get it.

3373
03:39:50,470 --> 03:39:51,410
That's no problem.

3374
03:39:51,530 --> 03:39:52,890
Unless I run into it on accident.

3375
03:40:02,260 --> 03:40:04,740
Not a single thought in that head.

3376
03:40:05,720 --> 03:40:06,140
Nope.

3377
03:40:07,800 --> 03:40:09,660
Not a single thought.

3378
03:40:10,280 --> 03:40:10,940
I'm just trying to...

3379
03:40:10,940 --> 03:40:11,480
I was like...

3380
03:40:11,480 --> 03:40:12,600
I was mostly like...

3381
03:40:12,600 --> 03:40:14,900
Man, I wanna play too so I can...

3382
03:40:14,900 --> 03:40:17,060
Well, obviously see how it plays.

3383
03:40:17,620 --> 03:40:20,340
Everybody always, you know, rags on the gameplay.

3384
03:40:20,960 --> 03:40:21,760
I also was just like...

3385
03:40:21,760 --> 03:40:23,080
What kind of story is there?

3386
03:40:23,480 --> 03:40:25,820
And I just don't...

3387
03:40:25,820 --> 03:40:27,320
I don't know!

3388
03:40:28,220 --> 03:40:30,580
I still have many questions!

3389
03:40:34,040 --> 03:40:35,480
I don't know anything!

3390
03:40:36,040 --> 03:40:36,880
Oh my god, please.

3391
03:40:37,040 --> 03:40:37,340
Dante.

3392
03:40:37,900 --> 03:40:38,220
Dante.

3393
03:40:38,380 --> 03:40:39,640
I think I'm gonna kill you.

3394
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:41,400
Dante, I swear to god.

3395
03:40:41,400 --> 03:40:43,000
Just jump on...

3396
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:44,940
Just jump on the door, please!

3397
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:49,660
I don't even know which way I need to go!

3398
03:42:37,690 --> 03:42:39,510
Oh no, I went back the same way.

3399
03:42:39,950 --> 03:42:40,630
How is that poss...

3400
03:42:43,090 --> 03:42:44,190
How is that possible?

3401
03:42:45,150 --> 03:42:46,670
This is the way I did before.

3402
03:42:47,250 --> 03:42:47,650
What?

3403
03:42:52,430 --> 03:42:53,330
That's the door?

3404
03:42:54,150 --> 03:42:55,910
That's the way I came in, isn't it?

3405
03:42:58,790 --> 03:43:00,810
Isn't this the door that I came in?

3406
03:43:03,290 --> 03:43:03,810
Oh.

3407
03:43:14,030 --> 03:43:15,510
The pillar spun.

3408
03:43:17,610 --> 03:43:21,730
Yeah, I knew something opened, but I thought...

3409
03:43:24,690 --> 03:43:25,890
Well, you know what?

3410
03:43:25,970 --> 03:43:28,510
If the camera angle was better...

3411
03:43:28,510 --> 03:43:30,050
I would be able to know that!

3412
03:43:39,590 --> 03:43:40,590
I made it.

3413
03:43:41,090 --> 03:43:42,490
Glad I wasn't on headphones.

3414
03:43:46,590 --> 03:43:49,690
If it helps you get through this log, Dante has one...

3415
03:43:49,690 --> 03:43:52,110
Really sick one-liner at the final boss fight.

3416
03:43:52,510 --> 03:43:53,550
It's the only time he'll...

3417
03:43:53,550 --> 03:43:55,210
Wait, this is not the door out, is it?

3418
03:43:57,470 --> 03:43:59,150
This is just a money door.

3419
03:44:02,110 --> 03:44:03,390
I guess that's good too.

3420
03:44:04,970 --> 03:44:05,650
I only need...

3421
03:44:06,970 --> 03:44:07,410
Oh no.

3422
03:44:07,730 --> 03:44:09,430
It's just a little side room.

3423
03:44:11,110 --> 03:44:11,990
Indiana Jones?

3424
03:44:12,190 --> 03:44:12,870
Wait, actually!

3425
03:44:12,870 --> 03:44:13,010
Really?

3426
03:44:25,650 --> 03:44:26,510
Oh my god.

3427
03:44:26,570 --> 03:44:27,710
Oh my god, he actually hits?

3428
03:44:28,350 --> 03:44:29,530
These guys actually fight?

3429
03:44:48,400 --> 03:44:49,600
It's a ranged attack.

3430
03:44:50,260 --> 03:44:51,960
Wait no, get the other guy first please.

3431
03:44:52,200 --> 03:44:52,780
Get this guy.

3432
03:44:53,340 --> 03:44:54,460
Get Torso first.

3433
03:44:54,540 --> 03:44:54,700
No!

3434
03:44:55,420 --> 03:44:57,240
That's why I said get Torso first!

3435
03:44:58,700 --> 03:44:59,540
Oh my gosh.

3436
03:45:01,740 --> 03:45:02,220
Try

3437
03:45:05,890 --> 03:45:06,890
to kill him first.

3438
03:45:07,270 --> 03:45:07,990
Kill this guy.

3439
03:45:08,270 --> 03:45:09,830
Kill him and then we can kill him.

3440
03:45:16,680 --> 03:45:17,500
I didn't...

3441
03:45:17,500 --> 03:45:18,360
I didn't even jump.

3442
03:45:18,520 --> 03:45:19,080
What happened?

3443
03:45:19,300 --> 03:45:21,060
How did I fly in the air like that?

3444
03:45:22,060 --> 03:45:22,540
CT?

3445
03:45:22,820 --> 03:45:23,460
Nah, it's okay.

3446
03:45:23,600 --> 03:45:24,240
I don't need to.

3447
03:45:25,040 --> 03:45:26,320
I just need to shoot him.

3448
03:45:28,140 --> 03:45:28,920
It's all good.

3449
03:45:30,900 --> 03:45:32,180
It's all good.

3450
03:45:32,860 --> 03:45:34,160
And we're done.

3451
03:45:37,060 --> 03:45:38,300
Give me my money.

3452
03:45:41,020 --> 03:45:41,820
Thank you.

3453
03:45:42,000 --> 03:45:42,480
Okay, goodbye.

3454
03:45:44,440 --> 03:45:45,880
Okay, now I think...

3455
03:45:45,880 --> 03:45:46,340
Hold on.

3456
03:45:47,240 --> 03:45:47,600
Equip.

3457
03:45:48,560 --> 03:45:48,920
Amulet.

3458
03:45:49,800 --> 03:45:50,520
Move faster.

3459
03:45:51,620 --> 03:45:52,860
What's the other one we have?

3460
03:45:55,880 --> 03:45:56,680
Oh, okay.

3461
03:45:56,760 --> 03:45:57,320
We have the lightning.

3462
03:45:57,440 --> 03:45:57,740
Yeah, yeah.

3463
03:45:57,800 --> 03:45:58,200
Okay, okay.

3464
03:45:58,720 --> 03:46:01,880
Alright, I think I might have to DT for this...

3465
03:46:03,320 --> 03:46:04,260
This thing though.

3466
03:46:04,560 --> 03:46:05,220
Oh, I couldn't roll.

3467
03:46:05,380 --> 03:46:05,920
True, true.

3468
03:46:10,870 --> 03:46:11,950
Did that kill me?

3469
03:46:17,550 --> 03:46:17,910
Dante!

3470
03:46:24,570 --> 03:46:24,870
Uh...

3471
03:46:26,010 --> 03:46:27,550
The guns were back there.

3472
03:46:28,170 --> 03:46:28,770
Well...

3473
03:46:28,770 --> 03:46:30,490
Oh, I can go back and check.

3474
03:46:34,280 --> 03:46:34,880
Nevermind.

3475
03:46:35,340 --> 03:46:36,360
Um, that was weird.

3476
03:46:42,950 --> 03:46:43,550
Oh.

3477
03:46:44,430 --> 03:46:45,770
Wait, I wanna try...

3478
03:46:46,990 --> 03:46:48,430
Get in here, Dante!

3479
03:46:49,090 --> 03:46:50,570
I guess those don't break open.

3480
03:46:51,150 --> 03:46:53,810
Can I see where I'm going or...

3481
03:46:54,450 --> 03:46:54,990
What I'm...

3482
03:46:54,990 --> 03:46:55,990
How...

3483
03:46:55,990 --> 03:46:56,330
How?

3484
03:46:56,330 --> 03:46:56,410
How?

3485
03:46:58,810 --> 03:47:00,230
Above the thing you slashed?

3486
03:47:00,350 --> 03:47:00,830
Oh, they're up.

3487
03:47:01,010 --> 03:47:01,950
I can't see anymore.

3488
03:47:02,190 --> 03:47:02,330
Oh.

3489
03:47:03,130 --> 03:47:03,830
Like up here?

3490
03:47:04,790 --> 03:47:05,170
Ow!

3491
03:47:06,930 --> 03:47:07,610
Hold on.

3492
03:47:13,410 --> 03:47:14,390
Oh my god.

3493
03:47:17,790 --> 03:47:19,530
Okay, I can't slash that.

3494
03:47:22,850 --> 03:47:24,850
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

3495
03:47:25,070 --> 03:47:26,770
Like, it showed me a thing, but...

3496
03:47:26,770 --> 03:47:28,570
I'm confused by this thing.

3497
03:47:30,870 --> 03:47:32,170
I'm confused by it.

3498
03:47:32,290 --> 03:47:33,530
And I can't see anything!

3499
03:47:33,910 --> 03:47:34,770
I can't...

3500
03:47:34,770 --> 03:47:35,210
I...

3501
03:47:35,210 --> 03:47:36,810
Why am I...

3502
03:47:36,810 --> 03:47:38,910
Oh, maybe here.

3503
03:47:39,130 --> 03:47:39,950
Okay, hold on.

3504
03:47:43,490 --> 03:47:44,030
Please.

3505
03:47:44,510 --> 03:47:45,510
Show me camera.

3506
03:47:49,750 --> 03:47:49,990
Oh.

3507
03:47:50,470 --> 03:47:51,430
Here, here, here, here.

3508
03:47:53,330 --> 03:47:53,870
No!

3509
03:47:53,990 --> 03:47:55,410
This is where I just was!

3510
03:47:55,550 --> 03:47:55,990
Just kidding.

3511
03:47:57,690 --> 03:47:59,250
Oh my god!

3512
03:48:01,570 --> 03:48:02,530
Above here?

3513
03:48:03,010 --> 03:48:03,710
Oh gosh.

3514
03:48:03,750 --> 03:48:05,030
How am I supposed to get above?

3515
03:48:05,350 --> 03:48:06,590
I can't see anything.

3516
03:48:09,090 --> 03:48:10,290
I'm trying!

3517
03:48:10,790 --> 03:48:12,710
I'm trying, you guys.

3518
03:48:13,830 --> 03:48:14,890
I'm trying.

3519
03:48:18,550 --> 03:48:20,410
I can't see anything.

3520
03:48:21,430 --> 03:48:23,070
How is there anything above?

3521
03:48:23,890 --> 03:48:25,930
I'm so confused, you guys.

3522
03:48:26,170 --> 03:48:26,910
I'm seriously...

3523
03:48:26,910 --> 03:48:27,530
I don't know.

3524
03:48:35,290 --> 03:48:36,490
The wall...

3525
03:48:36,490 --> 03:48:38,730
You know the walls are four sided!

3526
03:48:46,930 --> 03:48:49,530
By the red orb room.

3527
03:48:50,090 --> 03:48:51,610
This is for the exit, right?

3528
03:48:52,090 --> 03:48:53,610
This is not for something stupid!

3529
03:48:56,770 --> 03:48:57,670
I fell.

3530
03:48:58,110 --> 03:48:59,310
Okay, I don't care anymore.

3531
03:48:59,830 --> 03:49:00,610
What is this thing?

3532
03:49:00,610 --> 03:49:01,350
Please.

3533
03:49:01,690 --> 03:49:02,490
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

3534
03:49:02,590 --> 03:49:02,950
I'm gonna die.

3535
03:49:05,190 --> 03:49:05,950
I'm free.

3536
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:29,280
I don't care about the gun so much.

3537
03:49:40,170 --> 03:49:40,770
What?

3538
03:49:41,150 --> 03:49:43,270
No more platforming.

3539
03:49:45,790 --> 03:49:46,990
No more...

3540
03:49:46,990 --> 03:49:49,010
No more...

3541
03:49:49,010 --> 03:49:51,370
No more platforming.

3542
03:49:56,950 --> 03:49:57,510
Bang!

3543
03:50:04,590 --> 03:50:05,970
Wait, does that one also give me anything?

3544
03:50:10,750 --> 03:50:13,050
Now you grab the ledge, Dante!

3545
03:50:15,970 --> 03:50:17,310
I hate this game.

3546
03:50:19,950 --> 03:50:22,510
I thought you were a parkour pro in Minecraft.

3547
03:50:23,390 --> 03:50:25,310
Why don't you guys understand?

3548
03:50:27,330 --> 03:50:27,610
Minecraft...

3549
03:50:28,110 --> 03:50:30,210
Is not the real world!

3550
03:50:47,560 --> 03:50:50,600
I think I can just get back on top of it though.

3551
03:50:52,180 --> 03:50:54,800
Now, how do I...

3552
03:50:54,800 --> 03:50:56,180
Okay, there are things in the air.

3553
03:50:57,020 --> 03:50:58,740
Okay game, show me!

3554
03:50:59,280 --> 03:51:00,360
The things...

3555
03:51:09,520 --> 03:51:10,480
Oh, okay, okay.

3556
03:51:18,880 --> 03:51:20,960
Do I go up from here or over?

3557
03:51:22,320 --> 03:51:23,620
Oh, away, away.

3558
03:51:23,620 --> 03:51:23,740
Okay.

3559
03:51:26,660 --> 03:51:27,680
Okay, nice.

3560
03:51:30,040 --> 03:51:32,480
The camera becomes so stiff here.

3561
03:51:36,000 --> 03:51:36,940
Is there anything?

3562
03:51:37,080 --> 03:51:37,600
What's over here?

3563
03:51:41,510 --> 03:51:42,750
Oh, okay, okay.

3564
03:51:42,850 --> 03:51:44,150
I could have gone either way I guess.

3565
03:51:46,090 --> 03:51:47,150
You bitch.

3566
03:51:47,630 --> 03:51:48,450
You bitch!

3567
03:51:48,590 --> 03:51:49,070
Bitch!

3568
03:51:49,330 --> 03:51:49,790
Bitch!

3569
03:51:50,110 --> 03:51:50,630
Bitch!

3570
03:51:51,010 --> 03:51:51,390
Bitch!

3571
03:51:51,770 --> 03:51:52,270
Bitch!

3572
03:52:04,530 --> 03:52:06,070
Was it this one?

3573
03:52:07,190 --> 03:52:08,970
Which is the one that I got to?

3574
03:52:15,070 --> 03:52:17,070
Which was the one I started at?

3575
03:52:17,150 --> 03:52:18,170
I don't even know anymore.

3576
03:52:30,120 --> 03:52:31,500
You can fly man.

3577
03:53:03,910 --> 03:53:04,970
What's up here?

3578
03:53:07,710 --> 03:53:09,050
This looks like secret.

3579
03:53:11,830 --> 03:53:13,490
Big money, big money.

3580
03:53:15,770 --> 03:53:17,530
These dolls are so creepy.

3581
03:53:17,910 --> 03:53:18,130
No?

3582
03:53:18,250 --> 03:53:18,590
No money?

3583
03:53:19,250 --> 03:53:19,670
No money?

3584
03:53:20,650 --> 03:53:21,630
When the money?

3585
03:53:23,090 --> 03:53:23,790
Okay, Ruth.

3586
03:53:28,710 --> 03:53:29,650
It's a puzzle.

3587
03:53:31,890 --> 03:53:32,910
Let's keep going.

3588
03:53:39,120 --> 03:53:41,140
So we can get a new power-up!

3589
03:53:41,420 --> 03:53:43,540
Oh my gosh, we have to figure this out.

3590
03:53:43,980 --> 03:53:44,540
Okay, hold on.

3591
03:53:46,860 --> 03:53:48,520
This one kind of looks like me.

3592
03:54:06,230 --> 03:54:10,630
I don't see anything that like...

3593
03:54:22,560 --> 03:54:24,400
2, 4, 6.

3594
03:54:25,720 --> 03:54:26,620
1, 2.

3595
03:54:28,380 --> 03:54:31,540
1, 2, 3, 4.

3596
03:54:31,660 --> 03:54:32,980
I hope it's not in a combo.

3597
03:54:34,060 --> 03:54:36,360
1, 2, 3, 4.

3598
03:54:36,380 --> 03:54:38,630
5, 6, 7.

3599
03:54:39,160 --> 03:54:39,580
Oh shit.

3600
03:54:46,730 --> 03:54:47,810
1, 2.

3601
03:54:48,450 --> 03:54:49,170
Oh, nevermind.

3602
03:54:50,690 --> 03:54:51,090
What?

3603
03:54:54,320 --> 03:54:55,780
Do I kiss it two times?

3604
03:55:01,200 --> 03:55:04,420
Somehow Mint's bug eyes are piercing through my soul.

3605
03:55:15,590 --> 03:55:16,670
Oh my god.

3606
03:55:19,170 --> 03:55:20,670
Wait, this guy's got arms...

3607
03:55:21,150 --> 03:55:22,230
He's got arms.

3608
03:55:22,270 --> 03:55:23,930
He's got eyeballs on his arms!

3609
03:55:25,010 --> 03:55:25,570
Oh my god.

3610
03:55:33,620 --> 03:55:34,640
Skip it Mint, please.

3611
03:55:34,660 --> 03:55:35,400
I beg of you.

3612
03:55:35,640 --> 03:55:37,400
Why doesn't someone just tell me the answer?

3613
03:55:37,520 --> 03:55:38,800
And then I can get the power-up.

3614
03:55:44,760 --> 03:55:47,780
Break all three of them fast before they respawn.

3615
03:55:48,020 --> 03:55:48,240
What?

3616
03:55:49,760 --> 03:55:51,660
You have to break all three simultaneously?

3617
03:55:54,260 --> 03:55:54,860
Oh?

3618
03:55:55,120 --> 03:55:55,660
You do?

3619
03:55:56,600 --> 03:55:56,940
Really?

3620
03:55:57,240 --> 03:55:57,700
In order?

3621
03:56:00,380 --> 03:56:01,200
Wait, how?

3622
03:56:01,740 --> 03:56:02,500
How do you do that?

3623
03:56:06,880 --> 03:56:07,480
Blinders!

3624
03:56:07,640 --> 03:56:08,920
Welcome to Manbush Appanku!

3625
03:56:34,190 --> 03:56:35,230
Oh my god.

3626
03:56:35,490 --> 03:56:35,810
No!

3627
03:56:36,030 --> 03:56:37,610
We were so...

3628
03:56:38,270 --> 03:56:42,050
We were so close.

3629
03:56:44,190 --> 03:56:45,610
Oh my god.

3630
03:56:45,610 --> 03:56:46,270
What?

3631
03:56:46,530 --> 03:56:47,570
Do guns work too?

3632
03:56:48,930 --> 03:56:49,990
Do guns work too?

3633
03:56:50,250 --> 03:56:50,710
Oh, shit.

3634
03:56:50,870 --> 03:56:51,730
No, that's not what...

3635
03:56:51,730 --> 03:56:52,010
No, please.

3636
03:56:57,040 --> 03:56:58,380
No, only melee.

3637
03:57:22,070 --> 03:57:23,330
Oh my god, I'm not close enough.

3638
03:57:28,810 --> 03:57:30,110
That wasn't fast enough.

3639
03:57:37,540 --> 03:57:39,200
DT slashes do more damage.

3640
03:57:39,280 --> 03:57:41,260
So you can do that to deal more damage.

3641
03:57:44,120 --> 03:57:44,380
Okay.

3642
03:57:46,680 --> 03:57:47,460
Oh my god.

3643
03:57:47,580 --> 03:57:48,460
No, no, stop, stop.

3644
03:57:54,990 --> 03:57:55,990
What the hell?

3645
03:57:57,350 --> 03:57:58,310
Oh, I...

3646
03:58:00,970 --> 03:58:01,450
Nevermind.

3647
03:58:01,730 --> 03:58:02,130
I guess.

3648
03:58:02,290 --> 03:58:02,990
I give up.

3649
03:58:03,650 --> 03:58:04,270
I give up.

3650
03:58:09,530 --> 03:58:10,110
Where are we?

3651
03:58:13,010 --> 03:58:14,410
Oh yeah, we go downstairs.

3652
03:58:16,510 --> 03:58:16,870
Okay.

3653
03:58:16,870 --> 03:58:16,930
Okay.

3654
03:58:19,170 --> 03:58:20,310
No, you had it?

3655
03:58:20,410 --> 03:58:21,990
I don't... I did not.

3656
03:58:23,710 --> 03:58:24,150
No.

3657
03:58:24,810 --> 03:58:25,990
No, that's not true.

3658
03:58:26,050 --> 03:58:26,650
I did not.

3659
03:58:31,970 --> 03:58:33,310
Am I a joke to you?

3660
03:58:56,190 --> 03:58:57,830
No, it's because there's this hole.

3661
03:59:06,830 --> 03:59:08,650
Okay, what is the power-up anyway?

3662
03:59:08,870 --> 03:59:10,090
Is it something I'll ever use?

3663
03:59:10,610 --> 03:59:11,310
What is this?

3664
03:59:12,610 --> 03:59:13,910
If anybody knows.

3665
03:59:14,710 --> 03:59:17,170
Why did you skip over the optional puzzle?

3666
03:59:20,370 --> 03:59:21,990
Chrono Amulet.

3667
03:59:22,870 --> 03:59:24,590
Rebellion swings faster?

3668
03:59:24,970 --> 03:59:25,910
Does it do more damage?

3669
03:59:34,270 --> 03:59:35,830
Faster regen.

3670
03:59:36,490 --> 03:59:37,010
That's it?

3671
04:00:06,620 --> 04:00:08,540
Come on!

3672
04:00:08,660 --> 04:00:09,880
Come on!

3673
04:00:09,880 --> 04:00:10,660
Come on!

3674
04:00:11,700 --> 04:00:12,620
It

3675
04:00:16,390 --> 04:00:19,870
wasn't fully regenerated!

3676
04:00:20,830 --> 04:00:23,090
It wasn't fully regenerated.

3677
04:00:23,410 --> 04:00:25,190
That's so messed up.

3678
04:00:25,550 --> 04:00:29,510
Wait, stop turning around you piece of shit Dante!

3679
04:00:29,950 --> 04:00:36,670
I literally have my analog stick literally facing towards this thing.

3680
04:00:50,990 --> 04:00:52,690
Wait, nothing happened.

3681
04:01:36,230 --> 04:01:37,250
Oh my god!

3682
04:01:37,350 --> 04:01:38,270
Oh my god!

3683
04:01:38,570 --> 04:01:38,910
Hello?

3684
04:01:39,210 --> 04:01:39,930
Give me a second!

3685
04:01:45,430 --> 04:01:46,310
Oh my god!

3686
04:01:46,390 --> 04:01:47,430
I just got here!

3687
04:01:48,430 --> 04:01:50,890
It didn't even give me a chance to move!

3688
04:01:51,290 --> 04:01:51,810
Oh my god!

3689
04:01:51,910 --> 04:01:52,590
Oh my god!

3690
04:01:52,710 --> 04:01:53,270
Oh my god!

3691
04:01:53,810 --> 04:01:56,970
Oh, what gun am I using?

3692
04:01:57,950 --> 04:01:58,710
There we go.

3693
04:01:59,490 --> 04:02:00,050
That's why.

3694
04:02:05,070 --> 04:02:09,190
Okay, back to actual... I wasted too much time on all of that.

3695
04:02:09,270 --> 04:02:10,450
I'm so upset right now.

3696
04:02:11,430 --> 04:02:14,130
I wasted so much time on all of that.

3697
04:02:15,010 --> 04:02:17,150
Here I am just trying to get through this damn game.

3698
04:02:17,290 --> 04:02:17,810
Oh, stop!

3699
04:02:23,950 --> 04:02:28,510
Oh my god, this thing... This spear is too crazy.

3700
04:02:32,290 --> 04:02:34,910
Oh my god, it's too crazy.

3701
04:02:38,110 --> 04:02:40,450
In a better game it would have been worth it.

3702
04:02:41,930 --> 04:02:42,770
Oh my gosh.

3703
04:02:42,910 --> 04:02:43,770
Oh my god!

3704
04:02:45,450 --> 04:02:46,110
Fuck it.

3705
04:02:55,020 --> 04:02:58,920
The wolf sounds so much like SniperWolf's wolves, I can't get over it.

3706
04:02:58,980 --> 04:03:02,380
I know it's just wolf sound, but it still makes me laugh.

3707
04:03:03,680 --> 04:03:04,460
Don't jump?

3708
04:03:04,660 --> 04:03:06,380
Okay, I won't jump.

3709
04:03:12,770 --> 04:03:14,450
But then dogs come after me.

3710
04:03:17,010 --> 04:03:17,990
I'm gonna die.

3711
04:03:19,010 --> 04:03:20,190
I'm not gonna make it.

3712
04:03:20,590 --> 04:03:21,530
I'm not gonna make it.

3713
04:03:23,190 --> 04:03:24,230
I'm not gonna make it.

3714
04:03:24,570 --> 04:03:25,310
I'm not gonna make it.

3715
04:03:32,000 --> 04:03:32,780
What the hell?

3716
04:03:35,560 --> 04:03:37,420
Why is it a different move all of a sudden?

3717
04:03:38,660 --> 04:03:39,180
That was weird.

3718
04:03:41,480 --> 04:03:42,900
There's a grorb, you're right.

3719
04:03:47,410 --> 04:03:47,850
Ouch.

3720
04:03:48,310 --> 04:03:51,790
Okay, thanks for giving me a second to collect myself.

3721
04:03:53,390 --> 04:03:55,870
Oh my god, I tried to avoid him.

3722
04:03:56,230 --> 04:03:58,270
I should have rolled instead of...

3723
04:03:58,270 --> 04:04:01,310
Well, rolling doesn't do anything either apparently.

3724
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:03,930
Give me some iframes or something, man.

3725
04:04:04,050 --> 04:04:06,370
Oh my god, I can't do this.

3726
04:04:06,490 --> 04:04:07,350
I hate this guy.

3727
04:04:08,270 --> 04:04:08,930
Oh my god.

3728
04:04:31,320 --> 04:04:31,760
Stop!

3729
04:04:31,940 --> 04:04:32,880
Stop with the wolf!

3730
04:04:51,580 --> 04:04:52,020
Okay.

3731
04:04:58,120 --> 04:04:58,480
Oh my gosh.

3732
04:05:02,160 --> 04:05:02,600
Unfair!

3733
04:05:02,960 --> 04:05:03,400
Unfair!

3734
04:05:04,100 --> 04:05:04,540
Unfair!

3735
04:05:15,680 --> 04:05:17,400
Oh my god, I dodged that.

3736
04:05:17,500 --> 04:05:18,760
I dodged it though.

3737
04:05:19,380 --> 04:05:20,680
I dodged it though.

3738
04:05:45,820 --> 04:05:49,420
I love how I said I dodged that though and someone was like, no you didn't.

3739
04:05:52,200 --> 04:05:54,240
Why do you guys hate me so much?

3740
04:05:56,240 --> 04:05:59,720
By saying I dodged it, I said...

3741
04:06:00,900 --> 04:06:03,280
Why do I have to explain myself to you?

3742
04:06:03,380 --> 04:06:03,940
It's fine.

3743
04:06:04,240 --> 04:06:04,880
It's fine.

3744
04:06:05,000 --> 04:06:07,120
Everything's fine.

3745
04:06:07,380 --> 04:06:08,280
Everything's fine.

3746
04:06:08,560 --> 04:06:09,720
I don't care anymore.

3747
04:06:12,740 --> 04:06:13,800
Well, you didn't.

3748
04:06:13,880 --> 04:06:15,900
I meant that I pressed the dodge button.

3749
04:06:20,710 --> 04:06:21,150
Oh,

3750
04:06:29,430 --> 04:06:29,910
there we go.

3751
04:06:30,030 --> 04:06:30,850
Okay, next mission.

3752
04:06:34,970 --> 04:06:35,850
Mission 12.

3753
04:06:36,030 --> 04:06:39,590
When the hunter and the protector meet, the last mystery will be given and received.

3754
04:06:39,730 --> 04:06:45,930
Okay, I'm gonna go get my eye drops real quick because I haven't blinked this entire stream and my eyes are really dry.

3755
04:06:46,310 --> 04:06:47,470
So give me one second.

3756
04:06:47,550 --> 04:06:48,110
I'll be right back.

3757
04:07:47,050 --> 04:07:47,930
Okey doker.

3758
04:08:01,680 --> 04:08:03,240
I dripped it all over my face.

3759
04:08:07,910 --> 04:08:09,190
I did it again.

3760
04:08:11,870 --> 04:08:16,430
Thank you guys for the superchats!

3761
04:08:18,630 --> 04:08:20,230
Blindness, thanks for the superchat earlier.

3762
04:08:21,430 --> 04:08:23,790
Happy to finally be able to join in superchat.

3763
04:08:23,910 --> 04:08:24,690
Thank you!

3764
04:08:26,250 --> 04:08:27,590
You didn't have to.

3765
04:08:32,490 --> 04:08:34,910
Why are you playing DMC2?

3766
04:08:35,410 --> 04:08:40,790
Because I can't say I'm a fan of something if I don't play the entire series.

3767
04:08:45,480 --> 04:08:47,840
It's how I exist.

3768
04:08:50,280 --> 04:08:51,620
I gotta do completion sake.

3769
04:08:55,240 --> 04:08:56,780
Most fans skip 2.

3770
04:08:56,920 --> 04:08:58,160
That's their problem.

3771
04:09:02,860 --> 04:09:09,620
If I say, hey, remember that part in 2 that was just such absolute suffering and someone goes...

3772
04:09:10,660 --> 04:09:12,000
Oh no, I skipped 2.

3773
04:09:12,240 --> 04:09:12,780
I'll be like...

3774
04:09:12,780 --> 04:09:13,960
I'll be like...

3775
04:09:25,740 --> 04:09:26,980
I won't do it again.

3776
04:09:27,040 --> 04:09:27,740
Whoops, I dropped it.

3777
04:09:28,400 --> 04:09:29,180
Thank you.

3778
04:09:29,860 --> 04:09:30,440
Okay, mission!

3779
04:09:30,760 --> 04:09:32,380
Wait, how much orbs did I have?

3780
04:09:32,480 --> 04:09:33,180
Sorry, I meant to check.

3781
04:09:33,460 --> 04:09:33,740
26!

3782
04:09:34,080 --> 04:09:35,080
Oh my gosh, we're so close.

3783
04:09:35,620 --> 04:09:36,660
We're so close to level 3.

3784
04:09:36,820 --> 04:09:37,220
Let's go.

3785
04:09:37,440 --> 04:09:38,240
Maybe next level?

3786
04:09:39,740 --> 04:09:40,500
Mission 12.

3787
04:09:41,480 --> 04:09:41,880
12.

3788
04:09:42,640 --> 04:09:43,060
Okay.

3789
04:09:47,860 --> 04:09:51,780
What the heck is this?

3790
04:09:52,060 --> 04:09:54,880
I'll take your word for it when it comes to Metal Gear Assassin.

3791
04:09:56,600 --> 04:09:57,500
Oh my gosh!

3792
04:09:58,080 --> 04:10:00,260
Hey, stop distracting me with Metal Gear.

3793
04:10:00,420 --> 04:10:01,760
Wait, how the fuck do I do this?

3794
04:10:02,060 --> 04:10:02,580
Oh my god,

3795
04:10:05,620 --> 04:10:06,180
what is this?

3796
04:10:07,920 --> 04:10:08,840
What is this?

3797
04:10:09,160 --> 04:10:10,200
I don't like this.

3798
04:10:13,000 --> 04:10:14,020
What the hell?

3799
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:19,600
Sargassi?

3800
04:10:19,600 --> 04:10:20,620
Sargassi, please!

3801
04:10:21,940 --> 04:10:23,620
So I just... What the?

3802
04:10:23,720 --> 04:10:23,940
What?

3803
04:10:26,500 --> 04:10:30,140
Oh my god, how do I avoid hitting this thing?

3804
04:10:30,280 --> 04:10:31,300
I don't understand!

3805
04:10:33,520 --> 04:10:34,740
Hit the gems?

3806
04:10:36,480 --> 04:10:36,920
Oh...

3807
04:10:38,780 --> 04:10:42,120
Oh my god,

3808
04:10:50,250 --> 04:10:50,470
please.

3809
04:10:51,230 --> 04:10:53,210
I can't... I'm gonna die.

3810
04:10:53,370 --> 04:10:54,050
I'm gonna die.

3811
04:10:57,130 --> 04:10:58,410
At least we just started.

3812
04:10:58,650 --> 04:10:59,650
Oh my god, I'm gonna die.

3813
04:10:59,770 --> 04:11:00,570
I'm gonna die for real.

3814
04:11:02,570 --> 04:11:03,930
I died for real.

3815
04:11:03,930 --> 04:11:05,930
Oh, and...

3816
04:11:14,200 --> 04:11:15,940
Wait, are they gonna come back around?

3817
04:11:16,960 --> 04:11:18,200
Push my body!

3818
04:11:24,110 --> 04:11:25,590
Push my body!

3819
04:11:27,890 --> 04:11:29,570
Okay, now it looks normal.

3820
04:11:33,240 --> 04:11:33,620
Okay.

3821
04:11:36,780 --> 04:11:37,160
Okay.

3822
04:11:37,160 --> 04:11:37,200
Okay.

3823
04:11:57,990 --> 04:11:58,750
Gosh, this...

3824
04:12:05,480 --> 04:12:06,720
He hit me instead.

3825
04:12:07,080 --> 04:12:09,000
Okay, so they go along the sides.

3826
04:12:09,140 --> 04:12:09,620
Okay, I see.

3827
04:12:09,700 --> 04:12:10,120
Now I see.

3828
04:12:13,160 --> 04:12:14,220
I was like, how?

3829
04:12:14,820 --> 04:12:16,800
The camera angle was so weird for me.

3830
04:12:16,860 --> 04:12:20,960
I couldn't tell what I was hitting or where I was.

3831
04:12:21,980 --> 04:12:22,900
Everything... Okay, nice.

3832
04:12:22,940 --> 04:12:23,580
We got another one.

3833
04:12:25,600 --> 04:12:28,260
Okay, I'm just gonna keep... Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

3834
04:12:28,680 --> 04:12:30,280
Leave me alone, please!

3835
04:12:30,460 --> 04:12:33,280
Once you are out of the range...

3836
04:12:35,000 --> 04:12:35,920
Okay, nice.

3837
04:12:36,460 --> 04:12:37,200
Nice, nice.

3838
04:12:39,480 --> 04:12:40,280
Don't worry!

3839
04:12:41,500 --> 04:12:42,260
Don't worry!

3840
04:12:42,740 --> 04:12:44,860
Oh, he's spitting at me.

3841
04:12:46,140 --> 04:12:47,720
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

3842
04:12:52,380 --> 04:12:54,620
Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.

3843
04:12:58,440 --> 04:13:01,060
Nope, nope, not... I didn't jump enough!

3844
04:13:01,420 --> 04:13:02,720
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

3845
04:13:12,860 --> 04:13:15,240
It does so much big damage!

3846
04:13:16,200 --> 04:13:17,300
Nice, nice.

3847
04:13:18,520 --> 04:13:19,540
Nice, nice.

3848
04:13:21,980 --> 04:13:25,740
He was around too much for me to feel like I...

3849
04:13:28,620 --> 04:13:32,360
You can fly above him, because that's what I was doing...

3850
04:13:33,260 --> 04:13:33,700
Oh, shoot.

3851
04:13:37,200 --> 04:13:37,600
Before...

3852
04:13:37,600 --> 04:13:38,240
Oh, shit.

3853
04:13:38,820 --> 04:13:39,300
Come on.

3854
04:13:40,500 --> 04:13:41,560
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3855
04:13:48,350 --> 04:13:50,250
But I also died before, so...

3856
04:13:51,910 --> 04:13:54,330
I just kept getting... Oh, shoot.

3857
04:13:54,470 --> 04:13:54,950
No, no, no.

3858
04:13:55,150 --> 04:13:56,590
Oh, I rolled on accident, that's why.

3859
04:13:56,590 --> 04:13:59,230
At least the skelly is leaving me alone.

3860
04:13:59,610 --> 04:14:00,250
Okay, here we go.

3861
04:14:00,530 --> 04:14:00,910
Here we go.

3862
04:14:05,710 --> 04:14:08,810
Oh my god, please.

3863
04:14:09,770 --> 04:14:11,590
Why can't I just lock on to these things?

3864
04:14:15,490 --> 04:14:15,890
Okay.

3865
04:14:33,640 --> 04:14:34,040
Generous.

3866
04:14:35,280 --> 04:14:37,260
I'm not used to this kind of generosity.

3867
04:14:38,260 --> 04:14:44,420
I don't think I got any rorbs from that entire fight, which is really great.

3868
04:14:47,540 --> 04:14:49,180
I'll get rorbs now!

3869
04:14:53,260 --> 04:14:53,840
Yes.

3870
04:14:59,080 --> 04:15:00,180
What's the other way?

3871
04:15:00,320 --> 04:15:00,560
Hold on.

3872
04:15:01,960 --> 04:15:03,180
Bad boss ahead?

3873
04:15:03,340 --> 04:15:04,100
Oh, no.

3874
04:15:12,670 --> 04:15:14,150
Is that the same door?

3875
04:15:16,990 --> 04:15:18,090
Oh, it's the same door.

3876
04:15:18,210 --> 04:15:18,730
Okay, just kidding.

3877
04:15:21,750 --> 04:15:22,150
Save?

3878
04:15:22,150 --> 04:15:23,410
I don't think it'll do anything.

3879
04:15:23,590 --> 04:15:24,530
I have no yorbs.

3880
04:15:26,010 --> 04:15:28,050
I'd have to go through the first guy again.

3881
04:15:30,230 --> 04:15:31,010
But, whatever.

3882
04:15:31,210 --> 04:15:32,010
I'll just save anyway.

3883
04:15:41,170 --> 04:15:42,030
She!

3884
04:15:52,730 --> 04:15:54,130
Whatever.

3885
04:16:00,810 --> 04:16:01,510
Save!

3886
04:16:12,030 --> 04:16:13,770
This is nonsensical.

3887
04:16:13,930 --> 04:16:16,590
I have no idea why we're here...

3888
04:16:16,590 --> 04:16:18,170
Who this is...

3889
04:16:18,790 --> 04:16:20,170
What we're doing...

3890
04:16:23,350 --> 04:16:24,590
Like, what is that?

3891
04:16:24,730 --> 04:16:26,470
Why are we in this location?

3892
04:16:27,930 --> 04:16:29,010
Oh my god.

3893
04:16:40,210 --> 04:16:41,330
Oh, gosh.

3894
04:16:41,450 --> 04:16:41,590
Okay.

3895
04:16:45,730 --> 04:16:48,670
Okay, there's a... Alright, there's a...

3896
04:16:54,510 --> 04:16:55,210
Okay, cool.

3897
04:16:55,210 --> 04:16:57,170
I'll stay back here.

3898
04:17:00,650 --> 04:17:03,130
Okay, that's fine.

3899
04:17:14,090 --> 04:17:15,090
DT to win?

3900
04:17:17,270 --> 04:17:18,830
Thank you for the Aqua Super!

3901
04:17:19,810 --> 04:17:20,690
Wait, hold on.

3902
04:17:21,270 --> 04:17:22,870
Doing a fancy restaurant.

3903
04:17:23,970 --> 04:17:25,090
Squeaky screams.

3904
04:17:25,250 --> 04:17:25,470
No!

3905
04:17:32,230 --> 04:17:33,270
Wait, hold on!

3906
04:17:33,350 --> 04:17:33,670
I can't...

3907
04:17:34,630 --> 04:17:36,410
I can't read it, though.

3908
04:17:38,430 --> 04:17:42,790
Wait, I can't tell if bad boss meant like... I thought you guys meant tough.

3909
04:17:44,470 --> 04:17:45,850
Oh, it got a little longer.

3910
04:17:53,830 --> 04:17:55,030
Is it getting longer?

3911
04:17:56,470 --> 04:17:57,590
Or am I crazy?

3912
04:18:00,930 --> 04:18:02,090
Did it get longer?

3913
04:18:03,070 --> 04:18:04,590
Oh my gosh!

3914
04:18:14,660 --> 04:18:15,740
Oh, that was close.

3915
04:18:17,720 --> 04:18:18,120
Ouch!

3916
04:18:18,360 --> 04:18:18,940
Oh my god.

3917
04:18:20,260 --> 04:18:22,820
I don't think it's that he's walking towards me.

3918
04:18:22,920 --> 04:18:24,240
I think they're actually...

3919
04:18:24,240 --> 04:18:24,960
Oh my god.

3920
04:18:27,000 --> 04:18:30,340
Wait, he's now in like the middle of the room, so it's kind of actually tough.

3921
04:18:30,940 --> 04:18:31,480
Okay, hold on.

3922
04:18:32,140 --> 04:18:32,860
We need to get him.

3923
04:18:34,560 --> 04:18:36,740
I think he was like, allocating...

3924
04:18:38,300 --> 04:18:39,200
The... What's it called?

3925
04:18:39,200 --> 04:18:41,260
You know, like the chain?

3926
04:18:42,460 --> 04:18:43,100
For one.

3927
04:18:44,460 --> 04:18:48,060
And like, making it... So it made the other one longer, you know what I mean?

3928
04:18:51,100 --> 04:18:51,840
He's walking?

3929
04:18:52,080 --> 04:18:53,140
Oh, is that just all?

3930
04:18:53,500 --> 04:18:57,540
I wish these guys would... Oh, yeah, they're short again.

3931
04:19:00,260 --> 04:19:01,660
You can hit the lackeys.

3932
04:19:03,020 --> 04:19:03,980
Stupid lackeys.

3933
04:19:16,490 --> 04:19:18,190
Oh, that was close.

3934
04:19:21,250 --> 04:19:23,270
Oh, that was so close!

3935
04:19:23,370 --> 04:19:24,650
See, he makes it longer.

3936
04:19:25,350 --> 04:19:26,870
Unless he just moves closer.

3937
04:19:27,990 --> 04:19:29,430
The more he throws.

3938
04:19:35,190 --> 04:19:35,570
Ouch.

3939
04:19:38,050 --> 04:19:40,810
Oh my god, he is an absolute tank.

3940
04:19:41,450 --> 04:19:42,770
Tank of a man.

3941
04:19:43,970 --> 04:19:44,950
Good lord.

3942
04:19:47,530 --> 04:19:48,810
That's not what I wanted to do.

3943
04:19:50,030 --> 04:19:52,490
Please stop summoning guys, it's annoying me.

3944
04:19:56,800 --> 04:20:00,480
Oh my god, he is such a tank.

3945
04:20:01,620 --> 04:20:03,200
Oh, and now he's... Okay, there we go.

3946
04:20:15,820 --> 04:20:18,420
I like how this guy was running towards me.

3947
04:20:23,320 --> 04:20:24,700
Oh, that was close.

3948
04:20:27,660 --> 04:20:28,540
Kill you.

3949
04:20:32,480 --> 04:20:35,660
It's okay, we'll get more DT the more we kill these guys.

3950
04:20:35,660 --> 04:20:35,840
Guys.

3951
04:20:45,150 --> 04:20:45,610
Ouch!

3952
04:20:46,690 --> 04:20:47,490
Oh my god.

3953
04:20:57,170 --> 04:21:00,530
I didn't realize you could do one after another like that.

3954
04:21:05,670 --> 04:21:07,890
Oh my god, there's too many guys.

3955
04:21:08,490 --> 04:21:08,770
DT.

3956
04:21:19,490 --> 04:21:22,630
Oh god, we haven't even gotten to the red!

3957
04:21:24,210 --> 04:21:25,370
Holy mo...

3958
04:21:42,280 --> 04:21:42,880
Oh...

3959
04:21:50,500 --> 04:21:52,360
Close, close, close.

3960
04:21:54,640 --> 04:21:55,780
Close to red.

3961
04:21:56,800 --> 04:21:57,520
At least.

3962
04:22:03,470 --> 04:22:04,170
No!

3963
04:22:04,590 --> 04:22:07,070
I landed in the worst possible spot.

3964
04:22:07,370 --> 04:22:09,550
I was trying to get over to the side of the room.

3965
04:22:17,030 --> 04:22:18,130
Wombo combo.

3966
04:22:22,430 --> 04:22:24,290
Let's get more... Oh, oh, gosh.

3967
04:22:24,550 --> 04:22:25,070
That was close.

3968
04:22:31,110 --> 04:22:32,230
More DT.

3969
04:22:33,430 --> 04:22:34,430
More DT.

3970
04:22:35,430 --> 04:22:36,590
DT on the guy.

3971
04:22:38,770 --> 04:22:40,030
Okay, very cool.

3972
04:22:40,330 --> 04:22:41,510
Yeah, very fun.

3973
04:22:42,010 --> 04:22:42,650
Yeah, we know.

3974
04:22:43,890 --> 04:22:44,690
Very cool.

3975
04:22:45,510 --> 04:22:45,810
Okay.

3976
04:22:49,690 --> 04:22:50,850
Just a little bit more.

3977
04:22:51,550 --> 04:22:52,490
Just a little bit more.

3978
04:23:05,540 --> 04:23:06,340
Oh my god.

3979
04:23:08,620 --> 04:23:10,300
These guys come charging for me.

3980
04:23:12,240 --> 04:23:13,240
They're on a mission.

3981
04:23:14,560 --> 04:23:15,960
Gotta get to the other side of the room.

3982
04:23:17,360 --> 04:23:17,800
Yeah,

3983
04:23:21,760 --> 04:23:22,700
I knew you were gonna do that.

3984
04:23:22,860 --> 04:23:23,760
I knew you were gonna do that.

3985
04:23:26,680 --> 04:23:26,960
Okay.

3986
04:23:31,060 --> 04:23:31,500
Alright.

3987
04:23:32,240 --> 04:23:33,020
Shoot, shoot, shoot.

3988
04:23:33,360 --> 04:23:34,900
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

3989
04:23:35,400 --> 04:23:36,980
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

3990
04:23:36,980 --> 04:23:38,760
Shoot, shoot, shoot!

3991
04:23:40,540 --> 04:23:41,100
Doesn't

3992
04:23:45,350 --> 04:23:45,610
matter.

3993
04:23:46,050 --> 04:23:47,650
Yeah, take this guy out.

3994
04:23:48,190 --> 04:23:49,570
Take this guy out.

3995
04:23:49,990 --> 04:23:51,510
Take this guy out.

3996
04:23:53,190 --> 04:23:54,690
Give me more DT.

3997
04:23:55,710 --> 04:23:59,690
Give me more DT power up.

3998
04:24:02,010 --> 04:24:04,530
Okay, just a little bit more and I'll do another one.

3999
04:24:08,330 --> 04:24:09,610
Oh my god, close.

4000
04:24:12,730 --> 04:24:13,810
Ah, shoot!

4001
04:24:23,170 --> 04:24:25,710
Oh my god, he can't even get me in the air.

4002
04:24:26,110 --> 04:24:26,950
Messed up.

4003
04:24:30,310 --> 04:24:30,730
Okay.

4004
04:24:36,250 --> 04:24:37,970
He like, walks.

4005
04:24:38,610 --> 04:24:40,370
I don't understand how he walks.

4006
04:24:43,070 --> 04:24:44,230
Because he's not.

4007
04:24:49,910 --> 04:24:53,130
I think it's like the momentum pushing him forward, right?

4008
04:24:53,410 --> 04:24:54,730
A bad boss indeed.

4009
04:24:55,070 --> 04:24:56,330
Yeah, this actually sucks.

4010
04:24:56,670 --> 04:24:57,810
I thought I was fine.

4011
04:24:58,190 --> 04:24:59,290
And then...

4012
04:24:59,290 --> 04:25:01,170
I just realized...

4013
04:25:01,170 --> 04:25:02,570
I'm not fine.

4014
04:25:09,470 --> 04:25:10,390
Oh my god.

4015
04:25:12,310 --> 04:25:14,310
Like, why can't you stay over there, you freak?

4016
04:25:16,030 --> 04:25:16,650
Derogatory.

4017
04:25:28,890 --> 04:25:30,930
Very slowly approaching.

4018
04:25:31,710 --> 04:25:32,510
He approach.

4019
04:25:35,090 --> 04:25:37,810
And I have to fight these bozos...

4020
04:25:37,810 --> 04:25:39,850
Instead of just shooting him.

4021
04:25:41,370 --> 04:25:43,930
While he's like so far away, you know?

4022
04:25:44,430 --> 04:25:47,970
And so he ends up getting all nice and close and cozy with me.

4023
04:25:48,390 --> 04:25:49,630
I don't like that!

4024
04:25:53,110 --> 04:25:56,370
If I just touch his balls, is it gonna hurt me?

4025
04:25:57,510 --> 04:25:58,470
Genuine question.

4026
04:25:59,470 --> 04:26:00,470
Sorry for the phrasing.

4027
04:26:05,330 --> 04:26:06,970
But, actual question.

4028
04:26:07,610 --> 04:26:11,510
Like, if they're just there and I walk up into them...

4029
04:26:13,070 --> 04:26:16,510
If I just approach him, if I just accidentally, you know...

4030
04:26:19,810 --> 04:26:21,230
I wanna stay...

4031
04:26:21,230 --> 04:26:21,710
Oh my gosh.

4032
04:26:27,440 --> 04:26:28,840
Oh my god.

4033
04:26:29,500 --> 04:26:29,780
No.

4034
04:26:33,840 --> 04:26:35,560
Okay, okay, hold on.

4035
04:26:41,430 --> 04:26:41,990
Alright.

4036
04:26:42,590 --> 04:26:43,470
I'm gonna DT.

4037
04:26:43,890 --> 04:26:44,950
We're gonna...

4038
04:26:44,950 --> 04:26:45,750
Oh, nevermind.

4039
04:26:45,910 --> 04:26:46,650
I'm not gonna DT.

4040
04:26:48,750 --> 04:26:51,170
I wanted to while he was far away.

4041
04:26:52,470 --> 04:26:54,470
I wanted to while he was far.

4042
04:26:56,310 --> 04:26:57,370
Okay, now I can.

4043
04:27:02,540 --> 04:27:03,100
What?

4044
04:27:03,700 --> 04:27:04,760
What is this?

4045
04:27:07,160 --> 04:27:08,220
Oh my god.

4046
04:27:09,880 --> 04:27:13,640
Oh, we're getting into the final parts of the battle now, eh?

4047
04:27:14,220 --> 04:27:14,700
Yeah?

4048
04:27:15,480 --> 04:27:16,220
Oh my gosh.

4049
04:27:24,800 --> 04:27:25,760
Grid base.

4050
04:27:29,120 --> 04:27:31,740
This is why I love the pistols, because I...

4051
04:27:32,220 --> 04:27:36,340
If I go up into the air, I'm in the air for a minute, usually.

4052
04:27:36,740 --> 04:27:39,700
Oh, I say as I come back down really quickly.

4053
04:27:40,320 --> 04:27:41,080
Go away!

4054
04:27:41,820 --> 04:27:42,620
Go, go.

4055
04:27:48,150 --> 04:27:49,770
And they're fast now.

4056
04:27:49,910 --> 04:27:50,930
They're so fast.

4057
04:27:51,910 --> 04:27:53,670
Oh my gosh, I couldn't even see.

4058
04:27:54,050 --> 04:27:55,270
This is so unfair.

4059
04:27:55,470 --> 04:27:55,970
I can't...

4060
04:27:55,970 --> 04:27:56,870
Oh my god, please.

4061
04:27:57,050 --> 04:27:58,830
From the angle, I can't even see.

4062
04:28:04,980 --> 04:28:06,280
Oh my gosh.

4063
04:28:10,060 --> 04:28:11,600
Please kill the guys.

4064
04:28:11,740 --> 04:28:12,500
Kill the minions.

4065
04:28:12,780 --> 04:28:13,560
I don't care.

4066
04:28:19,230 --> 04:28:20,490
Kill these bozos.

4067
04:28:25,460 --> 04:28:26,270
Another thing.

4068
04:28:29,530 --> 04:28:30,270
Okay.

4069
04:28:30,770 --> 04:28:33,150
I'm gonna DT in...

4070
04:28:33,150 --> 04:28:33,650
Now!

4071
04:28:37,890 --> 04:28:38,500
Oh my god.

4072
04:28:38,680 --> 04:28:40,420
I'm taking damage, but it's okay.

4073
04:28:40,660 --> 04:28:41,000
Just go!

4074
04:28:44,930 --> 04:28:46,040
The grind.

4075
04:28:56,580 --> 04:28:59,040
Give me big money for that.

4076
04:28:59,040 --> 04:28:59,560
I swear.

4077
04:28:59,860 --> 04:29:00,480
The other side?

4078
04:29:00,600 --> 04:29:00,740
Okay.

4079
04:29:04,090 --> 04:29:04,690
Goodness.

4080
04:29:07,810 --> 04:29:09,150
Get me out of there.

4081
04:29:14,480 --> 04:29:16,600
And we came to this place and...

4082
04:29:17,920 --> 04:29:19,020
Now we're leaving.

4083
04:29:19,320 --> 04:29:20,140
Oh yeah, grandma.

4084
04:29:23,880 --> 04:29:24,480
Final?

4085
04:29:25,840 --> 04:29:26,980
I obtained eight...

4086
04:29:27,820 --> 04:29:28,420
What?

4087
04:29:29,680 --> 04:29:30,900
What's the story?

4088
04:29:31,540 --> 04:29:32,240
Okay.

4089
04:29:34,080 --> 04:29:34,560
Granny.

4090
04:29:49,480 --> 04:29:54,320
Oh, it's Lucia.

4091
04:29:57,500 --> 04:29:59,620
This guy sucks.

4092
04:30:05,460 --> 04:30:07,740
Your lucky streak continues, Granny.

4093
04:30:09,320 --> 04:30:10,380
Show us Dante.

4094
04:30:10,520 --> 04:30:11,100
Is it really?

4095
04:30:12,460 --> 04:30:14,940
Or are you just being a sensitive man?

4096
04:30:16,820 --> 04:30:18,520
15 minute boss...

4097
04:30:18,520 --> 04:30:19,720
Or 16 minute boss.

4098
04:30:19,980 --> 04:30:20,320
Gosh.

4099
04:30:26,680 --> 04:30:27,360
Alright.

4100
04:30:28,980 --> 04:30:30,760
30,000 you guys!

4101
04:30:30,880 --> 04:30:32,120
We can upgrade our guns!

4102
04:30:34,900 --> 04:30:37,160
Let's go power up!

4103
04:30:41,760 --> 04:30:44,160
Reach level 3 on any gun with Dante.

4104
04:30:55,200 --> 04:30:55,860
Alright.

4105
04:31:00,770 --> 04:31:04,050
The hunter will learn to feel with a leap of faith.

4106
04:31:05,130 --> 04:31:07,250
We're back in Brazil, I guess.

4107
04:31:10,090 --> 04:31:11,050
Oh no.

4108
04:31:11,550 --> 04:31:13,190
I don't think she did a very good job.

4109
04:31:21,390 --> 04:31:21,870
Okay.

4110
04:31:28,290 --> 04:31:29,890
It does look like Heihachi.

4111
04:31:30,030 --> 04:31:31,250
That's what I was talking about earlier.

4112
04:31:32,670 --> 04:31:33,910
Mint, are you still shooting?

4113
04:31:38,310 --> 04:31:40,290
That's just a piece of crap.

4114
04:31:41,350 --> 04:31:43,510
He's literally holding it in his hand.

4115
04:31:49,650 --> 04:31:53,610
He didn't put it in a backpack, a purse or anything.

4116
04:31:54,150 --> 04:31:56,050
He's like, I'm gonna carry this all the way to Brazil.

4117
04:32:03,090 --> 04:32:03,570
But...

4118
04:32:07,580 --> 04:32:09,320
Your swan song will.

4119
04:32:11,880 --> 04:32:12,800
Oh my god.

4120
04:32:18,030 --> 04:32:19,230
He's summoning the...

4121
04:32:19,230 --> 04:32:20,050
Hold on.

4122
04:32:20,430 --> 04:32:21,410
I'm trying to lower...

4123
04:32:21,410 --> 04:32:21,850
Okay, there we go.

4124
04:32:25,690 --> 04:32:26,170
Alright.

4125
04:32:26,570 --> 04:32:28,730
Your swan song will.

4126
04:32:38,800 --> 04:32:39,800
Where'd the girl go?

4127
04:32:39,860 --> 04:32:40,380
Is she up there?

4128
04:32:40,480 --> 04:32:41,400
Oh yeah, she's still up there.

4129
04:32:41,400 --> 04:32:44,440
Where is this fancy place that we're at?

4130
04:32:47,180 --> 04:32:48,600
Oh, he's summoning more.

4131
04:32:48,800 --> 04:32:49,480
This guy sucks.

4132
04:32:54,760 --> 04:32:55,320
Okay.

4133
04:32:56,040 --> 04:32:57,080
You got some tricks?

4134
04:32:57,220 --> 04:32:58,460
I can see you got some tricks.

4135
04:33:02,000 --> 04:33:03,400
You've got some...

4136
04:33:04,220 --> 04:33:04,780
Okay.

4137
04:33:06,240 --> 04:33:07,820
Maybe I should...

4138
04:33:07,820 --> 04:33:10,520
The one thing that hits me is...

4139
04:33:10,520 --> 04:33:11,840
I have bullets.

4140
04:33:17,240 --> 04:33:18,300
He's smoking.

4141
04:33:24,400 --> 04:33:26,560
No, don't focus on that guy.

4142
04:33:26,780 --> 04:33:27,600
Who cares about him?

4143
04:33:34,980 --> 04:33:37,100
Step away from the girl.

4144
04:33:51,230 --> 04:33:53,150
He's just sitting there.

4145
04:33:53,150 --> 04:33:53,210
He's just sitting there.

4146
04:33:56,270 --> 04:33:57,170
Oh my god.

4147
04:33:57,510 --> 04:33:58,070
Oh my god.

4148
04:33:58,270 --> 04:33:59,210
Oh my god.

4149
04:33:59,510 --> 04:34:00,030
Oh, okay.

4150
04:34:02,870 --> 04:34:06,490
Alright, first it was just some little guys...

4151
04:34:06,490 --> 04:34:08,110
And then you're like, I'm sending in the big boys.

4152
04:34:13,060 --> 04:34:14,780
I wish these things had a...

4153
04:34:15,800 --> 04:34:16,840
Health bar though.

4154
04:34:24,930 --> 04:34:25,930
I'm mashing.

4155
04:34:26,670 --> 04:34:27,710
I'm mashing.

4156
04:34:29,250 --> 04:34:30,790
It's okay, we're getting DT.

4157
04:34:46,170 --> 04:34:47,570
Where did the goat go?

4158
04:34:48,190 --> 04:34:48,950
Is she still around?

4159
04:34:51,090 --> 04:34:52,090
Oh, there he is.

4160
04:34:57,280 --> 04:34:57,560
Okay.

4161
04:34:57,560 --> 04:34:57,640
Okay.

4162
04:35:08,420 --> 04:35:10,880
You have really bad camel toe.

4163
04:35:13,780 --> 04:35:14,900
What?

4164
04:35:30,150 --> 04:35:30,770
Lucia.

4165
04:35:31,070 --> 04:35:31,490
Lucia?

4166
04:35:31,710 --> 04:35:32,190
That was her name?

4167
04:35:52,700 --> 04:35:53,010
Okay.

4168
04:35:53,590 --> 04:35:54,910
You should've killed him though.

4169
04:35:56,470 --> 04:35:57,590
Nice, DT.

4170
04:35:58,990 --> 04:36:00,510
Good thing I have that power.

4171
04:36:01,270 --> 04:36:05,630
Good thing that power wasn't gate kept behind a stupid ass puzzle...

4172
04:36:05,630 --> 04:36:10,550
That I did technically beat and then it told me I didn't.

4173
04:36:10,870 --> 04:36:12,030
Good thing, right?

4174
04:36:18,270 --> 04:36:18,870
Alright.

4175
04:36:20,710 --> 04:36:22,830
Alright guys, mission 13.

4176
04:36:23,610 --> 04:36:25,050
This is like Dante's best outfit.

4177
04:36:25,170 --> 04:36:26,970
I wish it didn't suffer being stuck in this game.

4178
04:36:27,030 --> 04:36:27,950
It is really good.

4179
04:36:31,030 --> 04:36:32,430
Hmm.

4180
04:36:41,170 --> 04:36:42,570
What?

4181
04:36:45,290 --> 04:36:46,770
That's your dad?

4182
04:36:48,370 --> 04:36:49,770
Or...

4183
04:36:49,770 --> 04:36:50,830
There's still time.

4184
04:36:58,950 --> 04:37:00,630
Through the front door.

4185
04:37:09,850 --> 04:37:13,230
Four lights will open the door to the future and the past.

4186
04:37:13,710 --> 04:37:15,490
Well, that's how we open the door everybody.

4187
04:37:16,290 --> 04:37:17,590
It explained it for us.

4188
04:37:19,690 --> 04:37:21,130
Oh, it's max.

4189
04:37:21,210 --> 04:37:22,630
My gun is max now.

4190
04:37:22,950 --> 04:37:23,530
Wow.

4191
04:37:25,370 --> 04:37:26,730
I could get... Well, no.

4192
04:37:26,830 --> 04:37:28,350
I can't get a orb.

4193
04:37:30,330 --> 04:37:33,190
You can only have one gold orb at a time.

4194
04:37:33,590 --> 04:37:35,790
This game is messed up.

4195
04:37:36,230 --> 04:37:37,970
This game is so messed up.

4196
04:37:40,450 --> 04:37:41,590
Four more missions.

4197
04:37:41,770 --> 04:37:42,690
Yeah, only four more.

4198
04:37:43,550 --> 04:37:44,490
That's right.

4199
04:37:45,890 --> 04:37:46,490
Oh.

4200
04:37:47,590 --> 04:37:48,250
Dutch angle.

4201
04:37:48,610 --> 04:37:49,490
We're a little crooked.

4202
04:37:51,130 --> 04:37:52,670
We went... We were... Okay, hold on.

4203
04:37:52,710 --> 04:37:53,710
I want to explore this way.

4204
04:37:53,910 --> 04:37:55,930
But we were walking in the opposite direction.

4205
04:37:58,670 --> 04:37:59,710
It's eclipsed.

4206
04:38:00,370 --> 04:38:02,810
So we have to find the four lights.

4207
04:38:04,370 --> 04:38:05,250
Abyss goat?

4208
04:38:13,780 --> 04:38:14,660
Abyss goat.

4209
04:38:19,870 --> 04:38:20,670
Oh yeah.

4210
04:38:20,810 --> 04:38:22,630
Look how much more damage we're doing now.

4211
04:38:23,410 --> 04:38:24,170
So good.

4212
04:38:28,020 --> 04:38:29,520
Oh, there's a couple guys.

4213
04:38:29,700 --> 04:38:30,140
That's okay.

4214
04:38:30,700 --> 04:38:31,180
A biscuit.

4215
04:38:41,220 --> 04:38:42,560
We're doing the big damage.

4216
04:38:42,800 --> 04:38:43,540
The big monies.

4217
04:38:44,420 --> 04:38:46,220
Well, maybe not the big monies, but who cares.

4218
04:38:48,240 --> 04:38:48,900
Okay, good.

4219
04:38:50,480 --> 04:38:51,580
This is gameplay.

4220
04:39:00,020 --> 04:39:01,620
What is that?

4221
04:39:02,660 --> 04:39:03,100
Ziggy!

4222
04:39:03,520 --> 04:39:04,720
Thanks for the super chat.

4223
04:39:09,900 --> 04:39:10,700
Blood goat.

4224
04:39:12,300 --> 04:39:14,800
Oh, I think they're behind the wall.

4225
04:39:16,640 --> 04:39:17,860
This is that city.

4226
04:39:26,640 --> 04:39:27,680
Oh, there's two of them.

4227
04:39:29,560 --> 04:39:32,320
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

4228
04:39:32,440 --> 04:39:34,700
Okay, I have to look or else I'm gonna...

4229
04:39:34,700 --> 04:39:36,580
I'm gonna get shot at.

4230
04:39:36,660 --> 04:39:37,540
And that's no fun.

4231
04:39:37,540 --> 04:39:38,240
Oh, hello.

4232
04:39:39,040 --> 04:39:39,860
Oh my gosh.

4233
04:39:43,040 --> 04:39:45,080
Can they do something else?

4234
04:39:46,160 --> 04:39:47,080
This is so annoying.

4235
04:39:49,080 --> 04:39:49,620
Blood goat.

4236
04:39:50,220 --> 04:39:51,200
Die, blood goat.

4237
04:39:55,600 --> 04:39:57,820
Wait, where did the other guy go?

4238
04:39:58,240 --> 04:40:00,060
He just floated away.

4239
04:40:00,140 --> 04:40:01,540
I never got to finish killing him.

4240
04:40:02,120 --> 04:40:02,480
What?

4241
04:40:02,800 --> 04:40:04,400
What happened to that guy?

4242
04:40:06,460 --> 04:40:08,000
Oh, there he is.

4243
04:40:08,100 --> 04:40:08,630
I was like...

4244
04:40:08,960 --> 04:40:13,060
What happened to the abyss goat?

4245
04:40:13,360 --> 04:40:15,500
Oh shoot, I hate these guys so much.

4246
04:40:21,630 --> 04:40:22,970
I'm just gonna keep running.

4247
04:40:23,710 --> 04:40:25,030
We're just gonna run, you guys.

4248
04:40:25,750 --> 04:40:26,830
He ran just like me.

4249
04:40:28,390 --> 04:40:29,870
I can't see anything.

4250
04:40:30,050 --> 04:40:31,410
Why is the camera like this?

4251
04:40:34,690 --> 04:40:35,190
Okay.

4252
04:40:35,890 --> 04:40:37,730
Alright, we just gotta find...

4253
04:40:39,510 --> 04:40:41,130
The lights, right?

4254
04:40:41,610 --> 04:40:42,630
Four of them?

4255
04:40:42,850 --> 04:40:43,650
Couple of them?

4256
04:40:45,350 --> 04:40:46,630
Four, give or take.

4257
04:40:46,950 --> 04:40:47,710
Let's just keep running.

4258
04:40:48,550 --> 04:40:49,290
Oh my god.

4259
04:40:49,590 --> 04:40:52,310
They were like, yeah, Resident Evil camera.

4260
04:40:52,570 --> 04:40:53,630
What the hell?

4261
04:40:53,690 --> 04:40:55,170
I'm looking...

4262
04:40:56,510 --> 04:40:57,670
What is this?

4263
04:41:00,670 --> 04:41:01,870
What is this?

4264
04:41:04,910 --> 04:41:08,770
This is the exact mission where I drop the game.

4265
04:41:10,430 --> 04:41:11,310
Follow them.

4266
04:41:11,870 --> 04:41:12,610
Follow the robs.

4267
04:41:37,230 --> 04:41:37,750
Okay.

4268
04:41:38,470 --> 04:41:39,990
I love not knowing where I'm going.

4269
04:41:41,250 --> 04:41:42,870
Love it, love it, love it.

4270
04:41:48,400 --> 04:41:49,320
I found one!

4271
04:41:50,800 --> 04:41:51,680
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4272
04:41:53,540 --> 04:41:54,580
Oh my gosh.

4273
04:41:56,820 --> 04:41:57,420
Please.

4274
04:42:01,410 --> 04:42:02,690
Just go for the savage.

4275
04:42:02,830 --> 04:42:03,250
You know what?

4276
04:42:10,350 --> 04:42:10,950
Goodbye.

4277
04:42:11,450 --> 04:42:11,850
Goodbye.

4278
04:42:12,670 --> 04:42:13,210
Goodbye.

4279
04:42:15,290 --> 04:42:15,890
Goodbye.

4280
04:42:16,910 --> 04:42:17,510
Goodbye.

4281
04:42:17,970 --> 04:42:18,430
Goodbye.

4282
04:42:18,750 --> 04:42:18,890
Goodbye.

4283
04:42:22,190 --> 04:42:22,790
Please.

4284
04:42:24,330 --> 04:42:24,690
What?

4285
04:42:24,770 --> 04:42:26,010
There's more of you guys?

4286
04:42:29,450 --> 04:42:31,670
Oh my god, there's... Oh wait, that's the same guy.

4287
04:42:31,770 --> 04:42:31,930
Okay.

4288
04:42:32,610 --> 04:42:33,050
Wait.

4289
04:42:33,910 --> 04:42:36,410
And then he regenerated, which is so awesome.

4290
04:42:38,930 --> 04:42:39,710
Love that.

4291
04:42:39,970 --> 04:42:40,730
Love when that happens.

4292
04:42:40,930 --> 04:42:41,730
Love when that happens.

4293
04:42:42,130 --> 04:42:42,990
Love when that happens.

4294
04:42:43,170 --> 04:42:43,650
Love when that happens.

4295
04:42:43,910 --> 04:42:44,830
Go to the other guy.

4296
04:42:45,130 --> 04:42:45,910
Go to the other...

4297
04:42:45,910 --> 04:42:47,810
Okay, now they're both regenerated.

4298
04:42:47,890 --> 04:42:48,610
No, not quite.

4299
04:42:48,750 --> 04:42:49,230
Okay, hold on.

4300
04:42:51,790 --> 04:42:52,230
Please.

4301
04:42:52,530 --> 04:42:52,930
Please.

4302
04:42:53,210 --> 04:42:53,550
Please.

4303
04:42:54,390 --> 04:42:54,830
No!

4304
04:42:55,230 --> 04:42:56,230
He's gonna regenerate!

4305
04:42:56,650 --> 04:42:57,690
Leave the little babies!

4306
04:42:58,630 --> 04:43:00,070
I don't care about the babies!

4307
04:43:00,070 --> 04:43:01,270
Leave the babies!

4308
04:43:02,290 --> 04:43:02,730
Okay.

4309
04:43:04,370 --> 04:43:05,110
There we go.

4310
04:43:05,190 --> 04:43:05,390
Okay.

4311
04:43:06,050 --> 04:43:07,530
Alright, we at least got one of them.

4312
04:43:08,170 --> 04:43:09,330
Oh my god.

4313
04:43:11,370 --> 04:43:12,870
There's another guy!

4314
04:43:21,920 --> 04:43:23,800
There's always spawning another guy.

4315
04:43:36,130 --> 04:43:37,630
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.

4316
04:43:38,070 --> 04:43:38,790
What is it?

4317
04:43:38,850 --> 04:43:39,250
Right trigger?

4318
04:43:41,570 --> 04:43:42,450
Oh, shoot.

4319
04:43:43,490 --> 04:43:44,790
I can't... I can't aim.

4320
04:43:44,830 --> 04:43:45,730
I can't aim for shit.

4321
04:43:52,270 --> 04:43:53,310
Ferocity, please!

4322
04:43:54,970 --> 04:43:55,750
Lower them.

4323
04:43:55,850 --> 04:43:56,270
Lower them.

4324
04:43:56,830 --> 04:43:57,450
Lower them.

4325
04:43:57,530 --> 04:43:57,970
Lower them.

4326
04:43:59,990 --> 04:44:04,110
I guess I could try and kill one, but I'm afraid another one will just spawn instead.

4327
04:44:20,820 --> 04:44:22,220
Let's try the rocket launcher!

4328
04:44:27,150 --> 04:44:28,710
Maybe another one won't launch.

4329
04:44:29,950 --> 04:44:31,730
Maybe I'm just being paranoid.

4330
04:44:34,550 --> 04:44:35,870
Another one won't spawn.

4331
04:44:36,550 --> 04:44:37,250
Maybe it's okay.

4332
04:44:37,250 --> 04:44:38,850
Maybe it's okay.

4333
04:44:39,450 --> 04:44:40,290
Oh, it's okay!

4334
04:44:40,970 --> 04:44:42,210
Oh my gosh, it's okay.

4335
04:44:44,150 --> 04:44:45,150
That's right, Dante.

4336
04:44:45,470 --> 04:44:46,450
Light it up, baby!

4337
04:44:47,430 --> 04:44:48,150
Come on, Dante!

4338
04:44:49,270 --> 04:44:49,590
Yeah!

4339
04:44:50,110 --> 04:44:55,090
The movement of the demon world is slowly intensifying!

4340
04:44:55,510 --> 04:45:01,030
You need to release three more powers in order to reach the demon world!

4341
04:45:01,030 --> 04:45:01,190
The demon world!

4342
04:45:10,330 --> 04:45:13,090
We came from that way, so let's go down this way.

4343
04:45:16,750 --> 04:45:17,970
That's a lot of orbs.

4344
04:45:42,370 --> 04:45:42,730
Anyway...

4345
04:45:46,050 --> 04:45:48,190
I think I will buy...

4346
04:45:52,790 --> 04:45:54,030
I'll save for the plorb.

4347
04:45:54,690 --> 04:45:55,130
It's fine.

4348
04:45:56,190 --> 04:45:57,150
Save for the plorb.

4349
04:45:57,430 --> 04:45:58,490
Okay, we can't go in there.

4350
04:45:59,710 --> 04:46:01,770
The area is not good anymore, right?

4351
04:46:02,250 --> 04:46:03,310
The side told us everything.

4352
04:46:03,430 --> 04:46:04,330
You're one of us, Mint.

4353
04:46:09,630 --> 04:46:10,650
There it is!

4354
04:46:23,020 --> 04:46:24,920
I don't know how I did that, but...

4355
04:46:24,920 --> 04:46:25,700
Oh my gosh, please.

4356
04:46:36,110 --> 04:46:36,890
No, no, no!

4357
04:46:36,990 --> 04:46:37,350
There we go.

4358
04:46:37,790 --> 04:46:38,150
Nice.

4359
04:46:39,810 --> 04:46:40,170
Nice.

4360
04:46:42,610 --> 04:46:42,970
Nice.

4361
04:46:44,850 --> 04:46:47,610
Death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death, death.

4362
04:46:47,970 --> 04:46:49,930
Oh gosh, ouchie, ouchie, ouchie.

4363
04:46:52,810 --> 04:46:54,590
What the hell is the Brontomancer?

4364
04:46:56,350 --> 04:46:57,370
What does he do?

4365
04:46:57,610 --> 04:46:58,010
Oh my god.

4366
04:47:10,730 --> 04:47:12,330
He shoots bronts.

4367
04:47:15,190 --> 04:47:16,790
This guy is...

4368
04:47:16,790 --> 04:47:20,130
The Oramancers are decreasing my aura!

4369
04:47:25,390 --> 04:47:26,150
Okay.

4370
04:47:26,750 --> 04:47:28,030
What is that?

4371
04:47:34,530 --> 04:47:35,450
Jump, jump.

4372
04:47:36,170 --> 04:47:37,570
Jump, jump.

4373
04:47:37,890 --> 04:47:38,670
Oh, it's thunder.

4374
04:47:38,670 --> 04:47:40,370
Home, home, home.

4375
04:47:58,770 --> 04:47:59,330
Okay.

4376
04:47:59,530 --> 04:48:05,650
You can feel the movement of the demon world intensifying even more!

4377
04:48:06,770 --> 04:48:12,590
You need to release two more powers in order to reach the demon world.

4378
04:48:13,270 --> 04:48:13,970
So what?

4379
04:48:14,030 --> 04:48:15,030
Is this a door or something?

4380
04:48:15,290 --> 04:48:16,310
Or is this the demon world?

4381
04:48:16,430 --> 04:48:17,530
Oh, this is a door.

4382
04:48:32,850 --> 04:48:33,770
Evil roar.

4383
04:48:40,770 --> 04:48:43,870
I like how there is a staircase up to the...

4384
04:48:44,270 --> 04:48:45,650
It's just a big old starfish.

4385
04:48:50,710 --> 04:48:51,830
We'll leave that there.

4386
04:48:53,910 --> 04:48:55,710
I don't think I'm supposed to be here yet.

4387
04:48:56,670 --> 04:48:57,190
Maybe.

4388
04:48:58,330 --> 04:48:59,690
Patrick has seen better days.

4389
04:49:01,110 --> 04:49:01,710
Really now?

4390
04:49:01,810 --> 04:49:02,970
Because, I mean...

4391
04:49:04,150 --> 04:49:04,770
What the hell?

4392
04:49:05,870 --> 04:49:09,710
I think he's looking like he's, you know...

4393
04:49:09,710 --> 04:49:11,630
Got it all figured out for himself.

4394
04:49:14,110 --> 04:49:17,650
You know, he's a giant star.

4395
04:49:20,710 --> 04:49:22,370
He's grown so big.

4396
04:49:24,730 --> 04:49:27,550
He's even got little eyeballs now.

4397
04:49:27,710 --> 04:49:29,030
Well, I guess he always had eyeballs.

4398
04:49:31,230 --> 04:49:32,890
Was it this door?

4399
04:49:32,890 --> 04:49:34,110
Oh wait, down here.

4400
04:49:35,570 --> 04:49:36,310
We didn't go.

4401
04:49:37,350 --> 04:49:37,890
Or guess I...

4402
04:49:39,330 --> 04:49:39,810
No.

4403
04:49:40,770 --> 04:49:41,870
Wait, is this where I started?

4404
04:49:44,810 --> 04:49:45,750
Yes it is.

4405
04:49:45,950 --> 04:49:47,110
Oh my god.

4406
04:49:50,330 --> 04:49:52,390
I just went in a big ass circle.

4407
04:49:54,090 --> 04:49:55,370
There's one on the rooftops.

4408
04:49:55,490 --> 04:49:56,310
Okay, thank you.

4409
04:49:59,190 --> 04:50:01,290
Oh my gosh, I hate these abyss...

4410
04:50:01,290 --> 04:50:02,150
Oh, I see it!

4411
04:50:02,590 --> 04:50:03,710
Oh my gosh, I see it.

4412
04:50:03,750 --> 04:50:04,110
Thank you.

4413
04:50:22,970 --> 04:50:23,330
Ouch!

4414
04:50:23,950 --> 04:50:24,890
It kicked me in the air.

4415
04:50:25,550 --> 04:50:26,170
You didn't see it?

4416
04:50:26,230 --> 04:50:26,790
I got it.

4417
04:50:26,850 --> 04:50:27,670
I know where it is.

4418
04:50:30,810 --> 04:50:31,710
I saw it.

4419
04:50:31,750 --> 04:50:32,990
That's all that matters, right?

4420
04:50:34,050 --> 04:50:35,350
As long as I see it...

4421
04:50:36,210 --> 04:50:37,290
Then we can get it.

4422
04:50:37,670 --> 04:50:39,110
I don't know how to get it yet.

4423
04:50:39,190 --> 04:50:39,350
What?

4424
04:50:39,390 --> 04:50:40,090
There's another goat?

4425
04:50:40,610 --> 04:50:41,750
How many goats are there?

4426
04:50:48,330 --> 04:50:49,650
That should be all of them.

4427
04:50:50,850 --> 04:50:51,410
Okay.

4428
04:50:51,810 --> 04:50:56,510
How do we get all the way up here?

4429
04:50:56,690 --> 04:50:57,470
See it up there?

4430
04:50:58,470 --> 04:50:59,850
All the way up there.

4431
04:51:00,010 --> 04:51:00,690
Okay, hold on.

4432
04:51:01,270 --> 04:51:02,370
Let's go this way.

4433
04:51:05,610 --> 04:51:06,730
And then...

4434
04:51:06,730 --> 04:51:07,770
This way.

4435
04:51:08,770 --> 04:51:09,890
And then...

4436
04:51:09,890 --> 04:51:10,930
Can I go from here?

4437
04:51:12,010 --> 04:51:12,410
No.

4438
04:51:13,850 --> 04:51:15,530
Can I go from here?

4439
04:51:18,090 --> 04:51:18,970
Ah!

4440
04:51:23,400 --> 04:51:26,020
Free Roar for the way home.

4441
04:51:44,900 --> 04:51:45,340
Ah!

4442
04:51:46,820 --> 04:51:47,040
No!

4443
04:51:49,300 --> 04:51:50,180
Ah!

4444
04:51:50,220 --> 04:51:50,440
Okay.

4445
04:51:52,240 --> 04:51:55,160
You can feel the movement of the demon world intensifying to extreme!

4446
04:51:55,560 --> 04:51:58,700
You need to release one more power in order to reach the demon world!

4447
04:52:00,220 --> 04:52:01,020
Extreme demonics.

4448
04:52:03,480 --> 04:52:04,900
Where is the last one?

4449
04:52:15,570 --> 04:52:17,130
This is where there was water.

4450
04:52:25,620 --> 04:52:26,740
I'm trying to think.

4451
04:52:26,780 --> 04:52:28,360
It's in a weird place, is it?

4452
04:52:29,060 --> 04:52:30,300
I'm trying to think of a...

4453
04:52:30,300 --> 04:52:34,300
I guess I'll just circle back around and see...

4454
04:52:36,340 --> 04:52:38,840
Where I've gone to and where not.

4455
04:52:43,030 --> 04:52:45,050
These lights have nothing to do with it, right?

4456
04:52:45,170 --> 04:52:45,890
Oh, come on.

4457
04:52:54,910 --> 04:52:56,070
Oh my god.

4458
04:52:56,170 --> 04:52:58,050
I'm trying to leave, but I can't.

4459
04:52:58,910 --> 04:52:59,830
I'm trying to leave.

4460
04:53:06,780 --> 04:53:08,400
Let me know if I pass it.

4461
04:53:11,780 --> 04:53:13,460
Over around here.

4462
04:53:19,210 --> 04:53:20,530
Don't worry.

4463
04:53:25,050 --> 04:53:27,150
It's a place I haven't looked at yet.

4464
04:53:29,530 --> 04:53:31,750
Where is that?

4465
04:53:32,970 --> 04:53:34,610
A place I haven't looked at yet.

4466
04:53:51,570 --> 04:53:54,070
Didn't I have to go...

4467
04:53:54,070 --> 04:53:54,310
Yeah!

4468
04:53:57,190 --> 04:54:01,010
I remember having to go through here before.

4469
04:54:03,410 --> 04:54:04,710
I see it!

4470
04:54:08,350 --> 04:54:11,610
I am also smart!

4471
04:54:16,290 --> 04:54:17,970
The Bromancer!

4472
04:54:18,190 --> 04:54:19,150
The Bromancer!

4473
04:54:24,370 --> 04:54:26,790
That's why I said the leap of faith or whatever.

4474
04:54:32,930 --> 04:54:34,470
Where is the Bromancer?

4475
04:54:35,210 --> 04:54:37,030
Wait, there is also a hidden thing.

4476
04:54:37,970 --> 04:54:39,450
There is also a new power-up.

4477
04:54:40,970 --> 04:54:41,350
Bromancer!

4478
04:54:51,940 --> 04:54:52,960
Oh my gosh.

4479
04:55:01,150 --> 04:55:01,790
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

4480
04:55:01,910 --> 04:55:02,410
OK, you know what?

4481
04:55:02,650 --> 04:55:03,850
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

4482
04:55:05,030 --> 04:55:06,570
I just wanted to kill the Bromancer.

4483
04:55:10,650 --> 04:55:11,730
There are so many guys.

4484
04:55:13,310 --> 04:55:14,310
Give me your money.

4485
04:55:22,170 --> 04:55:24,110
They all have to die eventually.

4486
04:55:25,810 --> 04:55:26,750
Wait, what's this?

4487
04:55:28,710 --> 04:55:29,230
Merciless?

4488
04:55:29,590 --> 04:55:30,810
Collect all swords with Dante.

4489
04:55:30,950 --> 04:55:32,290
A sword with snakes engraved.

4490
04:55:32,530 --> 04:55:34,670
It's not powerful, but it has a wide range attack.

4491
04:55:35,670 --> 04:55:37,730
It kind of sucks, but...

4492
04:55:39,350 --> 04:55:40,730
You know, it works.

4493
04:55:43,770 --> 04:55:44,210
Oh!

4494
04:55:49,450 --> 04:55:50,710
Remake makes you the Viper Captain!

4495
04:55:51,650 --> 04:55:52,910
At least it's honest.

4496
04:55:55,150 --> 04:55:55,990
What do we get?

4497
04:55:56,110 --> 04:55:56,530
What do we get?

4498
04:55:56,590 --> 04:55:56,970
What do we get?

4499
04:56:03,850 --> 04:56:06,230
You have the swords, but you're missing the machine gun.

4500
04:56:06,830 --> 04:56:07,810
I don't care!

4501
04:56:08,770 --> 04:56:09,590
Healing heart.

4502
04:56:09,710 --> 04:56:12,210
A magic stone with the heart of a merciful goddess.

4503
04:56:13,750 --> 04:56:14,790
I'm gonna... Wait.

4504
04:56:15,430 --> 04:56:17,410
I thought the other one was healing.

4505
04:56:27,090 --> 04:56:27,590
C2!

4506
04:56:27,770 --> 04:56:28,230
C3!

4507
04:56:30,090 --> 04:56:32,750
Thanks for the five gifts.

4508
04:56:33,190 --> 04:56:35,270
You will be able to reach the demon world.

4509
04:56:36,650 --> 04:56:37,150
Okay.

4510
04:56:37,970 --> 04:56:41,390
Now do I go to Patrick Star again?

4511
04:56:45,390 --> 04:56:47,070
Maybe the other one was ice.

4512
04:56:54,190 --> 04:56:54,590
Oh.

4513
04:56:55,870 --> 04:56:56,270
Nevermind.

4514
04:56:57,030 --> 04:56:57,530
Spooked me.

4515
04:56:57,830 --> 04:56:59,610
I thought we were...

4516
04:56:59,610 --> 04:57:00,710
Do I go back to Patrick Star?

4517
04:57:00,810 --> 04:57:00,890
No?

4518
04:57:03,290 --> 04:57:04,590
Say hi to Manta Rock!

4519
04:57:06,330 --> 04:57:07,230
Was it this way?

4520
04:57:09,110 --> 04:57:09,510
Yeah.

4521
04:57:09,770 --> 04:57:10,370
It was this way.

4522
04:57:19,420 --> 04:57:19,820
No.

4523
04:57:20,120 --> 04:57:21,400
Actually, I don't know which way.

4524
04:57:26,220 --> 04:57:27,040
La la la!

4525
04:57:27,280 --> 04:57:27,820
La la la!

4526
04:57:27,860 --> 04:57:28,480
Don't pay attention!

4527
04:57:28,480 --> 04:57:32,300
If you miss a gun, a weapon or an amulet, you can get it back in a later mission.

4528
04:57:32,980 --> 04:57:33,620
Oh yeah!

4529
04:57:35,960 --> 04:57:36,440
Wait.

4530
04:57:36,880 --> 04:57:37,660
This way.

4531
04:57:39,960 --> 04:57:40,440
Right?

4532
04:57:40,600 --> 04:57:41,540
Down the little alleyway?

4533
04:57:43,600 --> 04:57:44,080
Dante!

4534
04:57:44,360 --> 04:57:44,540
Okay.

4535
04:57:44,680 --> 04:57:44,960
Chill.

4536
04:57:46,440 --> 04:57:47,160
Yeah, yeah.

4537
04:57:47,160 --> 04:57:47,560
Over here.

4538
04:58:02,610 --> 04:58:04,250
What does it mean?

4539
04:58:10,980 --> 04:58:11,580
Oh!

4540
04:58:14,220 --> 04:58:15,960
Manta Rock Barcode.

4541
04:58:18,460 --> 04:58:19,060
Nasty.

4542
04:58:19,900 --> 04:58:20,500
Okay.

4543
04:58:21,460 --> 04:58:22,840
I guess we are going to the demon world.

4544
04:58:23,820 --> 04:58:24,940
Into the demon hole.

4545
04:58:29,820 --> 04:58:30,100
No.

4546
04:58:36,800 --> 04:58:38,480
This game is trolling.

4547
04:58:38,680 --> 04:58:40,260
This game is trolling me right now.

4548
04:58:40,520 --> 04:58:41,160
No way.

4549
04:58:43,160 --> 04:58:44,780
This game is trolling me!

4550
04:58:45,160 --> 04:58:46,320
This game is trolling me!

4551
04:59:01,930 --> 04:59:03,630
I want to sting her so bad.

4552
04:59:10,690 --> 04:59:12,410
He's not doing anything though.

4553
04:59:15,450 --> 04:59:15,970
Hey!

4554
04:59:16,370 --> 04:59:20,010
You were so much freakier in the other game.

4555
04:59:20,250 --> 04:59:21,130
What's wrong with you?

4556
04:59:21,790 --> 04:59:22,470
What's wrong?

4557
04:59:22,930 --> 04:59:23,850
Why don't you do anything?

4558
04:59:24,230 --> 04:59:24,310
Oh.

4559
04:59:24,710 --> 04:59:25,530
There we go.

4560
04:59:39,540 --> 04:59:40,260
Don't worry.

4561
04:59:40,360 --> 04:59:41,940
The power has already been released.

4562
04:59:42,380 --> 04:59:45,380
It appears to supply the demon pulse to the gate below.

4563
04:59:45,600 --> 04:59:45,780
Okay.

4564
04:59:46,100 --> 04:59:46,200
What?

4565
04:59:47,160 --> 04:59:47,660
Thanks?

4566
04:59:48,220 --> 04:59:48,620
Oh, ouch.

4567
04:59:49,120 --> 04:59:50,820
You distracted me!

4568
04:59:51,100 --> 04:59:51,920
You threw off my groove!

4569
04:59:56,890 --> 04:59:57,890
Oh, come on.

4570
05:00:04,410 --> 05:00:05,330
That's awkward.

4571
05:00:18,690 --> 05:00:22,970
I want to get the... Well, I guess I don't need the orb right now.

4572
05:00:29,570 --> 05:00:30,430
Oh gosh!

4573
05:00:37,410 --> 05:00:38,770
Phantom, please.

4574
05:00:39,730 --> 05:00:41,230
The phantom pain real.

4575
05:00:41,870 --> 05:00:45,130
Why did I feel like I was going to become a...

4576
05:00:47,830 --> 05:00:48,850
There we go.

4577
05:00:49,490 --> 05:00:50,430
Defeated Phantom!

4578
05:00:54,930 --> 05:00:55,570
What?

4579
05:00:59,750 --> 05:01:00,890
That's it?

4580
05:01:02,950 --> 05:01:05,130
I can't believe that this clear time...

4581
05:01:05,790 --> 05:01:07,230
Is shorter then some of the bosses...

4582
05:01:12,470 --> 05:01:13,750
It hurts.

4583
05:01:16,290 --> 05:01:16,930
Alright.

4584
05:01:18,090 --> 05:01:19,490
3 more missions left.

4585
05:01:20,410 --> 05:01:22,770
15, 16... Oh no, four more missions.

4586
05:01:22,930 --> 05:01:24,310
15, 16, 17, 18.

4587
05:01:25,630 --> 05:01:26,930
Four more missions!

4588
05:01:27,850 --> 05:01:32,270
They swarm like clouds and desperately seek the hunter's dark blood.

4589
05:01:37,120 --> 05:01:38,240
Plorb time.

4590
05:01:39,320 --> 05:01:39,700
Nice.

4591
05:01:44,870 --> 05:01:46,790
Phantom on phantom violence.

4592
05:01:47,870 --> 05:01:49,210
We're almost free.

4593
05:01:50,230 --> 05:01:52,090
See, that's what I said, remember guys?

4594
05:01:52,210 --> 05:01:55,790
Five hours and then give a couple hours, you know?

4595
05:01:56,670 --> 05:01:59,610
That also takes into account... What's my health?

4596
05:01:59,710 --> 05:01:59,890
Wait.

4597
05:02:00,470 --> 05:02:01,270
What's my health like?

4598
05:02:02,590 --> 05:02:03,110
Oh, full.

4599
05:02:03,630 --> 05:02:08,110
It helps when I take a break, when I talk, when I explore, all that stuff.

4600
05:02:09,430 --> 05:02:11,810
Better check the lump.

4601
05:02:11,990 --> 05:02:12,690
There's a lump?

4602
05:02:12,910 --> 05:02:13,610
Where's a lump?

4603
05:02:15,210 --> 05:02:16,990
Web-covered lump, this?

4604
05:02:17,760 --> 05:02:18,550
The pimple?

4605
05:02:20,650 --> 05:02:22,850
This pimple right here?

4606
05:02:23,550 --> 05:02:24,610
Why do I check that?

4607
05:02:25,070 --> 05:02:26,130
This little nipple.

4608
05:02:27,170 --> 05:02:28,370
What are you, into pimple popping?

4609
05:02:30,770 --> 05:02:35,230
You haven't really beaten DMC2 until you also do Lucina's route.

4610
05:02:36,130 --> 05:02:41,590
I think that you are a liar.

4611
05:02:45,270 --> 05:02:46,390
What's her name?

4612
05:02:46,610 --> 05:02:47,290
Lucia?

4613
05:02:49,890 --> 05:02:51,050
What's her name?

4614
05:02:51,150 --> 05:02:51,910
I can't remember.

4615
05:02:52,770 --> 05:02:54,790
I don't remember how to pronounce it.

4616
05:02:56,510 --> 05:02:56,750
Hello?

4617
05:03:02,990 --> 05:03:03,670
Lucia?

4618
05:03:11,580 --> 05:03:13,980
Isn't it the same exact game though?

4619
05:03:14,160 --> 05:03:15,300
But... Oh my gosh.

4620
05:03:16,200 --> 05:03:17,020
What the hell?

4621
05:03:17,760 --> 05:03:18,720
What is this?

4622
05:03:18,780 --> 05:03:19,880
What do you mean by a time limit?

4623
05:03:21,740 --> 05:03:24,000
Why do I only have 3 minutes?

4624
05:03:24,220 --> 05:03:24,680
Oh my god.

4625
05:03:28,860 --> 05:03:30,460
What do you mean I only have 3 minutes?

4626
05:03:31,100 --> 05:03:31,740
For what?

4627
05:03:36,050 --> 05:03:37,270
Same game but in reverse.

4628
05:03:37,390 --> 05:03:39,370
Wait, actually...

4629
05:03:39,370 --> 05:03:39,910
Oh my gosh.

4630
05:03:47,360 --> 05:03:48,460
You know what?

4631
05:03:50,220 --> 05:03:51,220
Why am I crazy?

4632
05:03:55,990 --> 05:03:56,730
Oh!

4633
05:03:56,730 --> 05:03:57,470
Okay.

4634
05:03:58,850 --> 05:04:00,150
I see you, John.

4635
05:04:02,410 --> 05:04:03,370
I see you.

4636
05:04:08,540 --> 05:04:09,380
Kill him!

4637
05:04:09,820 --> 05:04:10,560
Kill him!

4638
05:04:19,830 --> 05:04:20,270
Death.

4639
05:04:21,090 --> 05:04:22,010
To all 3 of you.

4640
05:04:23,630 --> 05:04:25,550
And then... Oh, more of you.

4641
05:04:33,150 --> 05:04:33,770
No.

4642
05:04:33,770 --> 05:04:35,110
Oh, you still... No, nevermind.

4643
05:04:36,010 --> 05:04:36,610
Where is it?

4644
05:04:36,790 --> 05:04:36,790
Oh

4645
05:04:39,890 --> 05:04:43,850
my gosh.

4646
05:04:43,930 --> 05:04:44,450
More!

4647
05:04:45,110 --> 05:04:46,430
The Abyss Ghosts!

4648
05:04:57,220 --> 05:04:57,840
No!

4649
05:05:07,320 --> 05:05:11,260
Is it just survive or do I have to kill everything in the time?

4650
05:05:11,260 --> 05:05:12,620
I don't know.

4651
05:05:24,420 --> 05:05:25,440
Just survive?

4652
05:05:25,660 --> 05:05:25,820
Okay.

4653
05:05:30,330 --> 05:05:34,330
I hope you are not wrong.

4654
05:05:35,510 --> 05:05:37,050
I hope you are not wrong.

4655
05:05:37,390 --> 05:05:38,510
We only have 30 seconds.

4656
05:05:41,390 --> 05:05:41,930
Oh gosh.

4657
05:05:50,910 --> 05:05:51,910
I'm scared!

4658
05:05:51,910 --> 05:05:52,330
I'm scared!

4659
05:05:54,410 --> 05:05:55,210
I'm killing!

4660
05:05:55,490 --> 05:05:55,790
I'm killing!

4661
05:05:55,970 --> 05:05:56,290
I'm killing!

4662
05:06:07,710 --> 05:06:08,210
Wait.

4663
05:06:08,710 --> 05:06:09,210
Wait.

4664
05:06:09,350 --> 05:06:11,450
Is it survive or kill?

4665
05:06:12,450 --> 05:06:14,250
Some people are saying different things.

4666
05:06:17,430 --> 05:06:19,030
Is it survive or kill?

4667
05:06:20,390 --> 05:06:20,890
KILL?!

4668
05:07:05,170 --> 05:07:06,450
No, no, no.

4669
05:07:06,610 --> 05:07:10,380
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

4670
05:07:17,130 --> 05:07:22,410
I didn't save!

4671
05:07:25,390 --> 05:07:27,690
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

4672
05:07:33,030 --> 05:07:34,150
Okay, okay.

4673
05:07:36,110 --> 05:07:37,650
Oh my gosh.

4674
05:07:38,050 --> 05:07:38,990
That would have been so bad.

4675
05:07:41,290 --> 05:07:41,790
Alright.

4676
05:07:42,130 --> 05:07:42,470
Let's go!

4677
05:07:42,470 --> 05:07:42,970
Oh my gosh!

4678
05:08:10,920 --> 05:08:16,520
Okay, as soon as I have good stuff to double trigger, I should.

4679
05:08:26,490 --> 05:08:28,890
That's such a tight time frame.

4680
05:08:43,110 --> 05:08:44,610
Die, die, die, baby, die, baby.

4681
05:08:45,110 --> 05:08:45,630
Die, baby.

4682
05:08:46,390 --> 05:08:47,610
Die, little baby.

4683
05:09:07,620 --> 05:09:11,540
Maybe someone will drop a little...

4684
05:09:12,680 --> 05:09:15,000
A little... What's it called?

4685
05:09:16,220 --> 05:09:18,440
Thing to boost, you know?

4686
05:09:20,140 --> 05:09:21,000
Oh my gosh.

4687
05:09:21,040 --> 05:09:22,020
Where is the other guy, please?

4688
05:09:35,520 --> 05:09:35,840
Okay.

4689
05:09:55,780 --> 05:09:57,360
Okay, nice.

4690
05:09:57,360 --> 05:09:57,440
Nice.

4691
05:10:11,020 --> 05:10:12,140
Oh god.

4692
05:10:13,300 --> 05:10:16,100
No, no, no, no.

4693
05:10:17,220 --> 05:10:18,260
Jump, jump, jump!

4694
05:10:31,980 --> 05:10:32,940
Die, Obstacle.

4695
05:10:33,140 --> 05:10:33,760
Oh my gosh.

4696
05:10:34,260 --> 05:10:36,180
Why did I get downed by a monkey?

4697
05:10:39,400 --> 05:10:40,280
Oh my gosh.

4698
05:10:40,540 --> 05:10:41,720
Stop touching me!

4699
05:11:07,740 --> 05:11:08,580
What's this?

4700
05:11:14,040 --> 05:11:14,740
No time!

4701
05:11:14,880 --> 05:11:16,060
Wait, time ran out?

4702
05:11:20,010 --> 05:11:21,490
Wait, just keep going?

4703
05:11:21,910 --> 05:11:22,630
Try again?

4704
05:11:23,930 --> 05:11:26,010
I thought it said I had a minute left.

4705
05:11:36,680 --> 05:11:37,620
Wait, what?

4706
05:11:38,420 --> 05:11:39,580
I'm so confused.

4707
05:11:51,240 --> 05:11:53,580
Maybe I read the wrong part of the...

4708
05:11:54,140 --> 05:11:55,800
Otherwise, I would've...

4709
05:11:57,200 --> 05:11:59,680
I was like, wow, I have so much time left.

4710
05:12:20,780 --> 05:12:21,880
Attack the eyes?

4711
05:12:22,240 --> 05:12:23,520
Wait, is that actually a thing?

4712
05:12:24,700 --> 05:12:25,000
The

4713
05:12:29,150 --> 05:12:30,630
enemies are different, so...

4714
05:12:31,890 --> 05:12:33,270
I don't know what's going on.

4715
05:12:33,830 --> 05:12:37,130
I don't... I don't know what's going on, man.

4716
05:12:59,040 --> 05:13:00,420
What the hell am I trying to find?

4717
05:13:00,500 --> 05:13:01,260
Oh, it's this sucker.

4718
05:13:16,000 --> 05:13:16,960
Oh god.

4719
05:13:17,720 --> 05:13:18,380
Fuck it.

4720
05:13:34,160 --> 05:13:35,760
Oh, I saw more guys.

4721
05:13:38,520 --> 05:13:39,000
Guys,

4722
05:13:55,450 --> 05:13:56,890
I don't think I'm gonna make it again.

4723
05:14:01,160 --> 05:14:01,640
No.

4724
05:14:02,280 --> 05:14:04,020
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna make it again.

4725
05:14:16,530 --> 05:14:17,590
Wait, did I make it?

4726
05:14:23,250 --> 05:14:24,930
I thought there were three routes!

4727
05:14:26,510 --> 05:14:27,550
Do I go in?

4728
05:14:30,750 --> 05:14:31,230
Okay.

4729
05:14:34,830 --> 05:14:36,530
I made it somehow!

4730
05:14:42,330 --> 05:14:45,330
I said this many rounds, VTuber!

4731
05:14:45,770 --> 05:14:49,370
Oh my gosh, I can't believe you were playing the game and not reading chat, VTuber.

4732
05:14:49,790 --> 05:14:50,670
I told you.

4733
05:14:50,910 --> 05:14:54,530
VTuber, did you not see my comment I wrote in the chat?

4734
05:14:54,830 --> 05:14:57,050
Two rounds on the second try.

4735
05:14:57,390 --> 05:15:01,050
Did you not see while you were playing the video game, VTuber?

4736
05:15:01,450 --> 05:15:04,450
Oh my gosh, I told you.

4737
05:15:04,450 --> 05:15:11,450
I thought you were supposed to read every single chat that comes in your view.

4738
05:15:11,870 --> 05:15:12,810
Which should be your entire...

4739
05:15:12,810 --> 05:15:18,610
What's the point of having two eyes if you can't read chat and also play the game at the same time?

4740
05:15:18,890 --> 05:15:21,310
Your eyes are going in different ways, VTuber.

4741
05:15:21,430 --> 05:15:24,070
You should be able to do multi things at once.

4742
05:15:24,510 --> 05:15:25,370
What's wrong with you?

4743
05:15:26,510 --> 05:15:27,330
Notice me, VTuber.

4744
05:15:27,470 --> 05:15:28,130
Hi, Alex.

4745
05:15:32,710 --> 05:15:33,690
Minto, are you okay?

4746
05:15:33,850 --> 05:15:34,510
Yeah, I'm fine.

4747
05:15:35,530 --> 05:15:36,630
We are almost done with the game.

4748
05:15:39,710 --> 05:15:41,310
I'm feeling good.

4749
05:15:45,570 --> 05:15:46,730
Mission 16.

4750
05:15:47,010 --> 05:15:50,950
Chaos ripens as the hunter runs towards the sky.

4751
05:15:52,070 --> 05:15:52,410
Okay.

4752
05:15:53,270 --> 05:15:55,270
How much raw arms do I got?

4753
05:15:56,030 --> 05:15:57,150
12,000!

4754
05:15:57,490 --> 05:15:58,270
You guys...

4755
05:15:59,890 --> 05:16:01,690
12,000 raw arms!

4756
05:16:03,530 --> 05:16:05,770
Should I get more purple orb?

4757
05:16:15,930 --> 05:16:16,490
Fifteen!

4758
05:16:19,250 --> 05:16:19,810
Fifteen!

4759
05:16:20,410 --> 05:16:21,250
Hey VTuber, I was cooking.

4760
05:16:21,350 --> 05:16:22,050
Why don't you do that?

4761
05:16:22,250 --> 05:16:23,510
Why didn't you do that thing?

4762
05:16:24,670 --> 05:16:25,230
Why?

4763
05:16:25,230 --> 05:16:25,350
Why?

4764
05:16:29,990 --> 05:16:31,310
Where are we?

4765
05:16:40,230 --> 05:16:40,770
What?

4766
05:16:44,330 --> 05:16:47,490
Maybe I should have gotten some devil... whatever.

4767
05:16:48,450 --> 05:16:49,610
The purple ones.

4768
05:16:51,070 --> 05:16:52,450
VTuber, why so cute when angry?

4769
05:16:56,510 --> 05:16:57,550
Where am I going?

4770
05:16:58,150 --> 05:16:58,550
Oh my god.

4771
05:16:58,690 --> 05:16:59,150
No, Dante.

4772
05:17:01,610 --> 05:17:02,710
Is there not a door?

4773
05:17:04,350 --> 05:17:05,230
I'm styling.

4774
05:17:05,890 --> 05:17:06,810
Maybe I go through here.

4775
05:17:06,970 --> 05:17:07,610
Oh, just kidding.

4776
05:17:07,870 --> 05:17:09,830
I have to activate it first.

4777
05:17:10,770 --> 05:17:12,410
Oh my god.

4778
05:17:21,300 --> 05:17:23,960
I don't feel like dealing with you right now.

4779
05:17:24,580 --> 05:17:27,200
You know, I don't feel like dealing with you right now.

4780
05:17:40,940 --> 05:17:42,780
Oh my god, there are so many appearing.

4781
05:17:44,000 --> 05:17:46,480
Yo, the demon world is crazy.

4782
05:17:51,040 --> 05:17:51,820
Hi VTuber.

4783
05:17:52,000 --> 05:17:52,420
Hi!

4784
05:18:00,210 --> 05:18:02,010
Is there a way to parry?

4785
05:18:02,370 --> 05:18:03,770
I thought I would be able to do it.

4786
05:18:15,070 --> 05:18:16,070
What?

4787
05:18:16,070 --> 05:18:16,070
Kill!

4788
05:18:17,150 --> 05:18:17,810
Blood for

4789
05:18:21,100 --> 05:18:21,600
the...

4790
05:18:28,270 --> 05:18:29,270
Hello?

4791
05:18:32,090 --> 05:18:33,130
Oh there we go.

4792
05:18:36,510 --> 05:18:38,170
Oh my gosh, Metal Gear.

4793
05:18:55,170 --> 05:18:56,850
Wait, launch the missile!

4794
05:18:58,970 --> 05:19:00,690
Why isn't it launching the missile?

4795
05:19:01,450 --> 05:19:03,530
Why isn't my missile launcher working?

4796
05:19:11,300 --> 05:19:12,980
Thank you for noticing me VTuber.

4797
05:19:17,120 --> 05:19:22,530
Oh, there it is.

4798
05:19:27,020 --> 05:19:29,400
Do I get hurt from the missile too?

4799
05:19:29,600 --> 05:19:30,220
I can't tell.

4800
05:19:30,340 --> 05:19:30,760
Oh my gosh.

4801
05:19:30,760 --> 05:19:33,240
Oh, it doesn't work mid-air.

4802
05:19:34,140 --> 05:19:36,440
That makes sense.

4803
05:19:42,880 --> 05:19:43,960
Bro, bro, bro!

4804
05:19:50,590 --> 05:19:54,430
Do you see them like freeze and they go like with their hands up?

4805
05:19:54,610 --> 05:19:55,290
So silly.

4806
05:20:10,400 --> 05:20:11,220
What's over here?

4807
05:20:15,500 --> 05:20:17,740
There's money in here, that's what there is.

4808
05:20:24,820 --> 05:20:28,400
Real question is, does the missile know where it is?

4809
05:20:28,600 --> 05:20:29,600
If so, how?

4810
05:20:31,700 --> 05:20:34,000
Does she know about the Resident Evil fact yet?

4811
05:20:34,400 --> 05:20:36,240
No, I don't.

4812
05:20:37,140 --> 05:20:40,460
Is this game related to Resident Evil?

4813
05:20:40,700 --> 05:20:41,620
Please tell me how.

4814
05:20:45,520 --> 05:20:46,900
Someone tell me, someone tell me.

4815
05:20:51,640 --> 05:20:54,280
This is Resident Evil 6.

4816
05:20:59,140 --> 05:21:00,060
Inhaled.

4817
05:21:00,620 --> 05:21:05,300
So, this is going to be Resident Evil Village.

4818
05:21:09,340 --> 05:21:10,940
Do I need devil stars?

4819
05:21:19,730 --> 05:21:21,590
Wait, this way.

4820
05:21:22,890 --> 05:21:24,310
This place is fancy.

4821
05:21:27,650 --> 05:21:30,270
Feels like some puppets are going to drop down.

4822
05:21:40,060 --> 05:21:42,660
I'll be honest though guys, I've been fighting a headache.

4823
05:21:42,920 --> 05:21:43,640
I don't know why.

4824
05:21:44,320 --> 05:21:47,620
Some days I just... Some days...

4825
05:21:49,680 --> 05:21:53,280
Some days I just get a bad headache.

4826
05:21:54,300 --> 05:21:57,280
I've been fighting it for a couple of hours but...

4827
05:21:58,100 --> 05:22:02,280
I've just been like, I want to get through the game so...

4828
05:22:03,480 --> 05:22:07,080
I might have to go take some medicine soon, I think.

4829
05:22:12,190 --> 05:22:13,410
I can't see!

4830
05:22:18,180 --> 05:22:18,880
Oh my god.

4831
05:22:24,740 --> 05:22:26,300
Oh my god!

4832
05:22:26,300 --> 05:22:27,120
Oh.

4833
05:22:32,570 --> 05:22:33,130
Anyway.

4834
05:22:35,570 --> 05:22:36,130
Sacrilege.

4835
05:22:36,630 --> 05:22:40,750
This will generate distortion and bring the world closer to the demon...

4836
05:22:40,750 --> 05:22:42,530
We're not in the demon world yet.

4837
05:22:43,930 --> 05:22:45,050
What do you mean?

4838
05:22:47,850 --> 05:22:48,970
But I...

4839
05:22:48,970 --> 05:22:50,910
Sending you energy so your head gets better.

4840
05:22:50,970 --> 05:22:51,470
Thank you.

4841
05:22:52,090 --> 05:22:53,490
But I thought we...

4842
05:22:54,110 --> 05:22:54,470
The

4843
05:22:59,480 --> 05:23:01,500
point of it all then...

4844
05:23:02,520 --> 05:23:04,220
Of this Patrick!

4845
05:23:05,360 --> 05:23:06,240
Oh my god!

4846
05:23:06,360 --> 05:23:06,920
Blorb!

4847
05:23:08,140 --> 05:23:09,400
My health.

4848
05:23:09,640 --> 05:23:10,100
Nice.

4849
05:23:14,870 --> 05:23:16,090
I have no clue where we are.

4850
05:23:16,190 --> 05:23:16,790
Me neither.

4851
05:23:17,610 --> 05:23:18,370
Is this not a door?

4852
05:23:25,950 --> 05:23:27,830
Is this a door?

4853
05:23:30,190 --> 05:23:32,730
Is mayonnaise an instrument?

4854
05:23:35,570 --> 05:23:37,910
What do I do with this heart?

4855
05:23:38,130 --> 05:23:38,650
Oh, here.

4856
05:23:40,270 --> 05:23:42,750
You put the sacrilege with evil statue.

4857
05:23:52,980 --> 05:23:55,000
Maybe this is a good game.

4858
05:23:58,340 --> 05:24:00,040
Oh my god.

4859
05:24:10,740 --> 05:24:12,360
Oh, I don't want this one.

4860
05:24:14,040 --> 05:24:15,060
Oh my goodness.

4861
05:24:19,860 --> 05:24:21,240
New pyromaniac you!

4862
05:24:31,380 --> 05:24:31,940
Oh!

4863
05:24:32,200 --> 05:24:32,400
Hello.

4864
05:24:33,080 --> 05:24:34,440
Sorry, I didn't notice you.

4865
05:24:35,260 --> 05:24:36,600
Speak up next time.

4866
05:24:37,060 --> 05:24:38,060
Gosh, too quiet.

4867
05:24:41,480 --> 05:24:41,900
Okay.

4868
05:24:42,960 --> 05:24:44,880
We have two ways we can go.

4869
05:24:45,060 --> 05:24:46,700
This way and this way.

4870
05:24:48,000 --> 05:24:49,520
Let's go this way first.

4871
05:24:52,340 --> 05:24:52,860
No!

4872
05:24:53,080 --> 05:24:54,220
Don't steal my aura!

4873
05:25:00,500 --> 05:25:01,840
Don't steal my aura!

4874
05:25:15,970 --> 05:25:17,210
I think we got him.

4875
05:25:19,470 --> 05:25:21,210
My aura kind of sucks.

4876
05:25:21,290 --> 05:25:21,670
Why?

4877
05:25:21,830 --> 05:25:22,790
There was nothing in there.

4878
05:25:23,750 --> 05:25:24,670
I lied?

4879
05:25:27,750 --> 05:25:29,670
We got the machine gun!

4880
05:25:29,790 --> 05:25:31,510
Wait, but it's a cell machine gun.

4881
05:25:31,730 --> 05:25:32,610
It's a little different.

4882
05:25:35,650 --> 05:25:36,990
Is that the one from before?

4883
05:25:41,300 --> 05:25:42,760
They were just in a vase.

4884
05:25:44,920 --> 05:25:46,340
That's where I keep all my guns.

4885
05:25:52,640 --> 05:25:53,280
Oh, thanks.

4886
05:26:03,600 --> 05:26:06,840
I got all the guns, but I don't get an achievement.

4887
05:26:06,940 --> 05:26:10,000
I got all the swords and I get an achievement, but no achievement for all the guns.

4888
05:26:10,100 --> 05:26:10,960
That doesn't make much sense.

4889
05:26:10,960 --> 05:26:14,260
I also sent ace combat brain rot and lore too.

4890
05:26:16,360 --> 05:26:17,120
Thank you.

4891
05:26:19,700 --> 05:26:21,080
Oh, there is one more.

4892
05:26:21,360 --> 05:26:21,780
I see.

4893
05:26:25,430 --> 05:26:27,650
Guys, I'm so lost.

4894
05:26:28,250 --> 05:26:28,850
Wait, huh?

4895
05:26:35,140 --> 05:26:38,500
Am I going in circles?

4896
05:26:48,760 --> 05:26:49,680
Sort of.

4897
05:26:56,560 --> 05:26:57,140
Okay, hold on.

4898
05:26:57,160 --> 05:26:57,700
Go left.

4899
05:26:59,740 --> 05:27:02,480
I hope I'm not... Marshall, you better not be one-guying me.

4900
05:27:02,540 --> 05:27:02,840
I swear.

4901
05:27:04,060 --> 05:27:05,140
Marshall, I know your name.

4902
05:27:05,940 --> 05:27:06,740
I can search you.

4903
05:27:07,460 --> 05:27:08,900
I can find you.

4904
05:27:18,600 --> 05:27:20,860
What's a really full version of sneeder?

4905
05:27:22,140 --> 05:27:22,960
So, left.

4906
05:27:22,960 --> 05:27:23,060
Left.

4907
05:27:35,960 --> 05:27:40,580
I feel like the more I try to avoid these guys, the more I get hit.

4908
05:27:40,700 --> 05:27:41,240
You know what I mean?

4909
05:27:41,340 --> 05:27:46,140
When I'm jumping, I'm like, oh yeah, I'm trying to play a game here.

4910
05:27:46,400 --> 05:27:48,480
I'm trying to jump around and have style.

4911
05:27:49,900 --> 05:27:53,720
But really, just whacking and shooting is...

4912
05:27:54,640 --> 05:27:57,020
I guess the right way to do it instead.

4913
05:27:59,460 --> 05:28:01,440
Wait, you mean I'm dyslexic.

4914
05:28:06,010 --> 05:28:08,630
There really was a full version of sneeder.

4915
05:28:09,850 --> 05:28:11,590
How am I dyslexic?

4916
05:28:11,650 --> 05:28:12,290
I read it right?

4917
05:28:23,540 --> 05:28:25,400
Guys, I think we are in the devil room.

4918
05:28:26,260 --> 05:28:27,780
I think we are getting close.

4919
05:28:28,440 --> 05:28:29,440
Oh my god.

4920
05:28:31,860 --> 05:28:32,420
No!

4921
05:28:32,420 --> 05:28:32,640
No!

4922
05:28:59,870 --> 05:29:00,830
Oh shoot.

4923
05:29:01,590 --> 05:29:02,650
I shouldn't have jumped.

4924
05:29:07,610 --> 05:29:08,250
Oh my gosh.

4925
05:29:13,740 --> 05:29:15,520
Why were you just standing there?

4926
05:29:15,700 --> 05:29:16,440
Oh, I killed him.

4927
05:29:18,140 --> 05:29:19,440
Sorry, sniper wolf.

4928
05:29:19,860 --> 05:29:20,260
Oh my gosh.

4929
05:29:28,080 --> 05:29:28,560
Oh,

4930
05:29:33,680 --> 05:29:35,500
I didn't see that he was coming towards me.

4931
05:29:36,960 --> 05:29:38,180
Oh my god, please.

4932
05:29:38,560 --> 05:29:39,380
I just got up.

4933
05:29:43,750 --> 05:29:44,570
You know what?

4934
05:29:44,710 --> 05:29:45,510
Screw it.

4935
05:29:45,710 --> 05:29:46,090
Fine.

4936
05:29:52,340 --> 05:29:53,340
Oh my gosh.

4937
05:29:55,640 --> 05:29:56,160
Please.

4938
05:30:03,660 --> 05:30:04,840
Oh, come on.

4939
05:30:04,980 --> 05:30:05,940
I can't see.

4940
05:30:08,700 --> 05:30:09,600
Oh my gosh.

4941
05:30:09,700 --> 05:30:13,840
How am I supposed to know what you are about to do if I can't fucking see you?

4942
05:30:14,140 --> 05:30:14,460
Please!

4943
05:30:18,310 --> 05:30:19,510
This is so gross.

4944
05:30:19,710 --> 05:30:21,090
I can't escape you guys.

4945
05:30:21,150 --> 05:30:22,090
I'm actually trapped.

4946
05:30:22,090 --> 05:30:23,290
I'm actually trapped.

4947
05:30:23,370 --> 05:30:23,990
Oh my gosh.

4948
05:30:30,550 --> 05:30:31,370
I don't care.

4949
05:30:31,590 --> 05:30:32,010
I don't care.

4950
05:30:32,230 --> 05:30:33,050
I don't want to die here.

4951
05:30:33,130 --> 05:30:33,890
I don't want to die here.

4952
05:30:53,900 --> 05:30:54,980
Oh my god.

4953
05:30:56,020 --> 05:30:56,800
No, no, no.

4954
05:30:56,840 --> 05:30:57,260
Don't jump!

4955
05:30:57,360 --> 05:30:58,220
Don't jump Dante!

4956
05:30:59,800 --> 05:31:00,480
Oh my gosh.

4957
05:31:00,560 --> 05:31:00,920
I'm trapped.

4958
05:31:01,820 --> 05:31:02,600
I can't see.

4959
05:31:02,800 --> 05:31:03,560
I can't see anything.

4960
05:31:03,820 --> 05:31:04,300
Where is he?

4961
05:31:04,500 --> 05:31:06,020
Why is the camera angle like this?

4962
05:31:06,280 --> 05:31:07,840
Why is the camera angle like this?

4963
05:31:08,640 --> 05:31:10,260
Why can't I see anything?

4964
05:31:10,260 --> 05:31:11,820
Oh my god.

4965
05:31:11,860 --> 05:31:12,940
I can't see a thing.

4966
05:31:13,380 --> 05:31:14,760
Please camera angle.

4967
05:31:16,140 --> 05:31:16,620
Why?

4968
05:31:16,980 --> 05:31:18,760
Why is it like this?

4969
05:31:19,200 --> 05:31:20,420
Just shoot.

4970
05:31:20,720 --> 05:31:21,280
Just shoot.

4971
05:31:21,520 --> 05:31:22,400
Just shoot baby.

4972
05:31:24,100 --> 05:31:25,360
I'm not hitting him though.

4973
05:31:25,440 --> 05:31:26,360
I don't know where he is.

4974
05:31:27,080 --> 05:31:27,860
Where did he go?

4975
05:31:28,420 --> 05:31:29,480
Why am I not hitting him?

4976
05:31:30,520 --> 05:31:31,120
Oh my god.

4977
05:31:31,140 --> 05:31:31,580
What's happening?

4978
05:31:32,060 --> 05:31:32,660
What is he doing?

4979
05:31:33,160 --> 05:31:34,800
Oh, that's why I'm not hitting him.

4980
05:31:39,900 --> 05:31:40,560
There we go.

4981
05:31:45,800 --> 05:31:46,600
Oh gosh.

4982
05:31:49,840 --> 05:31:51,460
Camera was the real boss.

4983
05:31:51,680 --> 05:31:53,240
I was like, why can't anyone...

4984
05:31:53,240 --> 05:31:54,000
What's happening?

4985
05:31:54,980 --> 05:31:57,920
I'm having the worst luck walking into a room and having to fight Fuwamuko...

4986
05:31:58,680 --> 05:31:59,700
and their demonic handler.

4987
05:32:01,420 --> 05:32:03,240
It's a good job considering the unfair circumstances.

4988
05:32:03,540 --> 05:32:04,080
Thank you!

4989
05:32:06,380 --> 05:32:06,780
Sacrilege.

4990
05:32:07,040 --> 05:32:09,920
This will generate distortion and bring the world closer to the demon world.

4991
05:32:11,140 --> 05:32:12,260
Can we go back this way?

4992
05:32:13,160 --> 05:32:13,840
Nope.

4993
05:32:14,000 --> 05:32:14,120
Okay.

4994
05:32:22,740 --> 05:32:23,420
Alright.

4995
05:32:24,440 --> 05:32:25,380
Evil statue.

4996
05:32:25,680 --> 05:32:26,180
Eat it.

4997
05:32:28,700 --> 05:32:29,560
Eat it.

4998
05:32:36,120 --> 05:32:42,070
Oh my gosh.

4999
05:32:42,170 --> 05:32:43,610
We are so close to the demon world.

5000
05:32:43,790 --> 05:32:44,270
That's crazy.

5001
05:33:00,370 --> 05:33:01,550
More guys.

5002
05:33:02,850 --> 05:33:04,230
Guys on the wall.

5003
05:33:05,910 --> 05:33:07,670
Guys on the floor.

5004
05:33:09,690 --> 05:33:11,970
Guys in my brain.

5005
05:33:12,890 --> 05:33:14,630
Little brain worms everywhere.

5006
05:33:23,420 --> 05:33:25,480
Oh, nevermind.

5007
05:33:25,820 --> 05:33:26,800
The guy is already dead.

5008
05:33:31,750 --> 05:33:32,410
This way?

5009
05:33:33,270 --> 05:33:34,810
Follow the orbs?

5010
05:33:36,970 --> 05:33:38,270
What is that?

5011
05:33:38,270 --> 05:33:42,940
Oh my gosh.

5012
05:33:43,020 --> 05:33:43,740
It's so dark.

5013
05:33:44,360 --> 05:33:46,020
I can't even see anything in here though.

5014
05:33:56,090 --> 05:33:57,450
Person who... Wait.

5015
05:33:58,250 --> 05:34:00,390
Who names of these enemies at a stroke.

5016
05:34:05,480 --> 05:34:06,120
Yeah!

5017
05:34:06,980 --> 05:34:07,440
Die!

5018
05:34:07,660 --> 05:34:07,940
Die!

5019
05:34:08,180 --> 05:34:08,420
Die!

5020
05:34:10,400 --> 05:34:11,900
Oh, another Abyss God.

5021
05:34:12,000 --> 05:34:15,660
Of course there is always at least several of them.

5022
05:34:15,660 --> 05:34:18,080
There is always several of them.

5023
05:34:19,920 --> 05:34:21,480
Now focus on the Abyss God.

5024
05:34:22,600 --> 05:34:23,120
No!

5025
05:34:26,800 --> 05:34:26,960
No!

5026
05:34:27,100 --> 05:34:28,040
Don't break the combo.

5027
05:34:28,180 --> 05:34:30,680
These things break my combo with these guys.

5028
05:34:30,780 --> 05:34:31,540
It's so annoying.

5029
05:34:35,020 --> 05:34:36,620
I'm Dark Souls right now.

5030
05:34:37,800 --> 05:34:38,600
I'm Dark Souls.

5031
05:34:39,840 --> 05:34:40,980
Oh, I think I got him.

5032
05:34:41,080 --> 05:34:41,180
Okay.

5033
05:34:43,260 --> 05:34:44,400
Gosh, please.

5034
05:34:46,000 --> 05:34:46,860
The SMGs?

5035
05:34:47,240 --> 05:34:47,780
What am I...

5036
05:34:50,780 --> 05:34:52,620
They do barely anything though.

5037
05:34:53,760 --> 05:34:55,100
Is he just gonna lie there?

5038
05:35:12,500 --> 05:35:14,120
There is actually no way.

5039
05:35:21,640 --> 05:35:23,700
There is actually no way that just happened.

5040
05:35:30,230 --> 05:35:31,350
I'm gonna turn it down.

5041
05:35:31,590 --> 05:35:33,310
Put the sacrilege with the evil statue.

5042
05:35:33,650 --> 05:35:34,670
How many more do we need?

5043
05:35:38,490 --> 05:35:39,290
Oh, wait.

5044
05:35:42,410 --> 05:35:43,330
How many more?

5045
05:35:43,410 --> 05:35:43,590
Oh!

5046
05:35:43,590 --> 05:35:45,790
I think we are in the demon world.

5047
05:35:46,130 --> 05:35:47,430
It didn't tell us anything.

5048
05:35:55,640 --> 05:35:57,580
Okay, this guy doesn't give up.

5049
05:35:58,000 --> 05:35:59,580
This guy doesn't have a death wish.

5050
05:35:59,700 --> 05:36:00,140
Oh, okay.

5051
05:36:00,440 --> 05:36:02,200
I missed my other guns.

5052
05:36:04,120 --> 05:36:05,660
They actually do damage.

5053
05:36:06,900 --> 05:36:08,140
Looks pretty human to me.

5054
05:36:08,640 --> 05:36:11,660
No, a little bit, but like...

5055
05:36:13,980 --> 05:36:15,080
I'm just gonna ignore.

5056
05:36:15,420 --> 05:36:16,180
Let's go this way.

5057
05:36:18,680 --> 05:36:19,880
I'm going this way.

5058
05:36:21,020 --> 05:36:22,120
I'm going in here.

5059
05:36:22,960 --> 05:36:24,060
Goes to make cry.

5060
05:36:24,180 --> 05:36:25,960
Oh no, we are not in the demon world.

5061
05:36:27,100 --> 05:36:28,260
Where are we?

5062
05:36:28,980 --> 05:36:30,180
This is the human...

5063
05:36:35,440 --> 05:36:38,940
I sure hope those guys don't wake up.

5064
05:36:39,880 --> 05:36:42,720
That would truly make a devil cry.

5065
05:37:15,710 --> 05:37:17,290
Hey, chill out.

5066
05:37:17,470 --> 05:37:18,870
Come down here and fight me.

5067
05:37:22,620 --> 05:37:24,540
He's not even looking at me.

5068
05:37:24,580 --> 05:37:25,540
This guy is...

5069
05:37:26,340 --> 05:37:27,400
Okay, let's see if it happens.

5070
05:37:27,520 --> 05:37:27,840
Oh, whoops.

5071
05:37:28,980 --> 05:37:29,540
Give up!

5072
05:37:30,060 --> 05:37:30,660
Give up!

5073
05:37:49,140 --> 05:37:50,600
Is this a sacrilege?

5074
05:37:52,640 --> 05:37:53,460
Oh, what?

5075
05:37:53,760 --> 05:37:55,920
I think that's the first time I've seen like a loading screen.

5076
05:37:58,500 --> 05:38:00,120
No, it's a...

5077
05:38:00,120 --> 05:38:01,500
Oh, it's one of these.

5078
05:38:01,700 --> 05:38:02,820
Okay, it's a power-up thing.

5079
05:38:04,240 --> 05:38:05,780
Paid actor demon.

5080
05:38:06,920 --> 05:38:08,280
What did we get?

5081
05:38:08,360 --> 05:38:09,820
We got a...

5082
05:38:12,380 --> 05:38:14,140
Oh, we got the ice one!

5083
05:38:14,740 --> 05:38:16,360
Then what was the other one?

5084
05:38:17,500 --> 05:38:19,640
A beautiful ice demon.

5085
05:38:21,680 --> 05:38:22,740
Let's go.

5086
05:38:33,790 --> 05:38:35,670
What was the other one?

5087
05:38:36,030 --> 05:38:37,450
We'll never know.

5088
05:38:37,810 --> 05:38:38,670
I think.

5089
05:38:42,750 --> 05:38:43,290
Okay.

5090
05:38:43,290 --> 05:38:44,550
Where have I not gone?

5091
05:38:47,030 --> 05:38:47,850
This way.

5092
05:38:49,670 --> 05:38:51,610
I don't have time to deal with you guys!

5093
05:38:54,230 --> 05:38:55,570
Wait, this way?

5094
05:38:57,850 --> 05:38:59,250
Oh, this is where I came from.

5095
05:39:00,850 --> 05:39:01,830
They're too stupid.

5096
05:39:01,950 --> 05:39:02,610
They don't know anything.

5097
05:39:03,370 --> 05:39:04,050
Let's ignore them.

5098
05:39:06,570 --> 05:39:07,590
I'm lost!

5099
05:39:07,870 --> 05:39:09,590
I'm just running for it!

5100
05:39:11,770 --> 05:39:12,970
Is there anything in here?

5101
05:39:13,370 --> 05:39:14,170
It's a dead end!

5102
05:39:19,640 --> 05:39:21,720
They make a lot of noise.

5103
05:39:22,180 --> 05:39:23,160
They're really squeaky.

5104
05:39:27,820 --> 05:39:29,880
Time stop amulet.

5105
05:39:33,890 --> 05:39:37,670
No, this was where the balls were.

5106
05:39:39,890 --> 05:39:41,050
Wait, where do I go?

5107
05:39:43,130 --> 05:39:44,550
Oh my gosh.

5108
05:39:45,030 --> 05:39:46,630
I'm so lost.

5109
05:39:48,530 --> 05:39:49,550
No way.

5110
05:39:50,030 --> 05:39:51,950
I'm so lost, you guys.

5111
05:39:52,530 --> 05:39:53,510
I have no idea.

5112
05:39:54,770 --> 05:39:55,750
I have zero idea.

5113
05:39:56,530 --> 05:39:57,190
Wait, what's in here?

5114
05:39:57,930 --> 05:39:58,510
Excuse me!

5115
05:39:58,910 --> 05:39:59,610
What's in here?

5116
05:40:01,710 --> 05:40:03,850
This is where we got the frost, right?

5117
05:40:20,330 --> 05:40:22,170
Let's check out our beautiful lady.

5118
05:40:24,010 --> 05:40:25,210
Is there a map?

5119
05:40:25,590 --> 05:40:26,030
What?

5120
05:40:27,830 --> 05:40:31,130
That would be helpful for players if there were a map.

5121
05:40:31,710 --> 05:40:34,450
Don't you understand what replayability is?

5122
05:40:34,830 --> 05:40:39,430
There's more replayability if you get them lost.

5123
05:40:39,930 --> 05:40:41,830
Or not replayability, more playtime.

5124
05:40:42,150 --> 05:40:44,650
If they get really lost and have no idea where to go.

5125
05:40:45,090 --> 05:40:46,590
That's just simple game design.

5126
05:40:47,690 --> 05:40:49,050
It says map on the menu?

5127
05:41:01,780 --> 05:41:04,640
Did you really expect me to be able to read?

5128
05:41:04,640 --> 05:41:05,980
Come on now.

5129
05:41:06,960 --> 05:41:07,980
Where are we?

5130
05:41:08,820 --> 05:41:11,520
Okay, but the map, I'll be honest, was not very helpful.

5131
05:41:14,160 --> 05:41:17,100
The map didn't help me at all.

5132
05:41:17,300 --> 05:41:17,920
Okay, hold on.

5133
05:41:26,690 --> 05:41:27,250
Down...

5134
05:41:29,690 --> 05:41:29,970
Right...

5135
05:41:32,510 --> 05:41:33,070
Right...

5136
05:41:33,070 --> 05:41:34,090
Very bottom?

5137
05:41:35,730 --> 05:41:37,430
Okay, I gotta go to the bottom.

5138
05:41:39,610 --> 05:41:43,110
I'm in the top right, so I need to go down to the middle?

5139
05:41:45,430 --> 05:41:45,590
Wait.

5140
05:41:48,610 --> 05:41:49,090
Down...

5141
05:41:54,600 --> 05:41:55,080
Right...

5142
05:41:55,080 --> 05:41:55,680
I think.

5143
05:42:02,060 --> 05:42:02,540
Down...

5144
05:42:02,540 --> 05:42:04,200
Wait, is it left or right?

5145
05:42:05,840 --> 05:42:06,420
Oh, here?

5146
05:42:09,400 --> 05:42:10,380
I think I found it.

5147
05:42:11,880 --> 05:42:12,280
Here?

5148
05:42:15,020 --> 05:42:16,340
Is this where I needed to be?

5149
05:42:17,040 --> 05:42:17,680
This door?

5150
05:42:20,500 --> 05:42:21,620
This is not a door.

5151
05:42:27,660 --> 05:42:29,180
Oh, I have to interact with it.

5152
05:42:29,260 --> 05:42:29,860
Oh my god.

5153
05:42:29,960 --> 05:42:30,860
Because it's the elevator.

5154
05:42:39,390 --> 05:42:40,590
Where's our ice babe?

5155
05:42:54,610 --> 05:42:55,750
Stay down!

5156
05:42:58,090 --> 05:42:58,670
Ouch.

5157
05:43:02,560 --> 05:43:04,200
Oh, that's not what I meant to do.

5158
05:43:04,400 --> 05:43:04,740
Oh shoot.

5159
05:43:06,300 --> 05:43:07,340
Nevermind, we're fine.

5160
05:43:12,440 --> 05:43:14,700
Does it look goofy with this angle?

5161
05:43:14,820 --> 05:43:15,760
It's always goofy.

5162
05:43:23,270 --> 05:43:25,090
I proved my point!

5163
05:43:34,210 --> 05:43:36,550
I absolutely proved my point!

5164
05:43:39,010 --> 05:43:41,010
Dante, do you have nothing to say about this?

5165
05:43:48,950 --> 05:43:50,450
Don't speak.

5166
05:43:52,190 --> 05:43:52,990
Oh yeah!

5167
05:44:02,950 --> 05:44:03,950
Okay.

5168
05:44:03,950 --> 05:44:04,030
Okay.

5169
05:44:07,170 --> 05:44:07,690
Alright.

5170
05:44:10,970 --> 05:44:12,150
Okay, okay, okay.

5171
05:44:14,550 --> 05:44:15,070
Dodge.

5172
05:44:15,890 --> 05:44:17,010
And he's icy.

5173
05:44:21,560 --> 05:44:22,420
Oh my god.

5174
05:44:22,580 --> 05:44:23,540
Wait, what the hell?

5175
05:44:25,860 --> 05:44:26,680
Oh my god.

5176
05:44:26,800 --> 05:44:27,200
Oh my god.

5177
05:44:32,500 --> 05:44:33,020
No!

5178
05:44:44,160 --> 05:44:46,180
And I can't... Oh, I can.

5179
05:44:49,240 --> 05:44:50,440
Oh, but it does nothing.

5180
05:44:50,940 --> 05:44:52,300
Oh my god, it does nothing to them.

5181
05:44:53,380 --> 05:44:53,820
Maybe?

5182
05:44:54,100 --> 05:44:54,740
I can't tell.

5183
05:44:58,590 --> 05:44:59,310
Here we go.

5184
05:45:07,930 --> 05:45:08,370
Nice.

5185
05:45:09,350 --> 05:45:10,870
That did decent damage at least.

5186
05:45:19,730 --> 05:45:20,170
Dodge!

5187
05:45:20,330 --> 05:45:23,250
Oh well, how am I supposed to know to dodge that?

5188
05:45:23,650 --> 05:45:24,570
Oh my gosh.

5189
05:45:25,950 --> 05:45:27,090
Like, we're the land.

5190
05:45:27,150 --> 05:45:28,110
How am I supposed to know?

5191
05:45:32,070 --> 05:45:33,310
I hate these ones.

5192
05:45:37,520 --> 05:45:38,260
Yeah, stupid!

5193
05:45:40,440 --> 05:45:42,460
Am I even doing damage?

5194
05:45:44,100 --> 05:45:44,880
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

5195
05:45:46,820 --> 05:45:48,920
Yes, I am kind of, I think.

5196
05:45:52,700 --> 05:45:53,140
No!

5197
05:45:53,140 --> 05:45:54,700
Gosh, how am I supposed to avoid that?

5198
05:46:06,840 --> 05:46:08,300
Wait, I think I did too early.

5199
05:46:08,480 --> 05:46:09,800
I did it too early!

5200
05:46:18,580 --> 05:46:24,680
Only for a little bit, but a little bit is... A little bit is better, I guess, than none.

5201
05:46:33,240 --> 05:46:34,340
Oh my gosh.

5202
05:46:34,520 --> 05:46:34,900
Oh my gosh.

5203
05:46:34,980 --> 05:46:37,560
These guys

5204
05:46:41,140 --> 05:46:41,580
suck.

5205
05:46:42,980 --> 05:46:44,640
But they're actually not so bad.

5206
05:46:45,820 --> 05:46:46,500
For now.

5207
05:46:46,640 --> 05:46:48,900
Oh my gosh, I say, until...

5208
05:46:52,680 --> 05:46:53,780
Oh my gosh.

5209
05:47:03,480 --> 05:47:06,240
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to avoid that?

5210
05:47:12,980 --> 05:47:13,760
Please.

5211
05:47:20,860 --> 05:47:22,020
Please, so close.

5212
05:47:27,340 --> 05:47:28,120
Dead.

5213
05:47:35,780 --> 05:47:37,320
Anything else in here?

5214
05:47:39,400 --> 05:47:40,720
Who was that guy?

5215
05:47:44,720 --> 05:47:45,880
Who was that guy?

5216
05:47:53,770 --> 05:47:54,970
Just some dude.

5217
05:47:55,810 --> 05:47:57,330
Wait, is there anything around here?

5218
05:48:00,410 --> 05:48:00,930
Nothing?

5219
05:48:01,170 --> 05:48:02,210
OK, let's go in.

5220
05:48:03,470 --> 05:48:04,450
Check the chair.

5221
05:48:11,310 --> 05:48:13,690
It's so huge and I'm so teeny tiny.

5222
05:48:14,930 --> 05:48:15,290
Rafi!

5223
05:48:15,590 --> 05:48:16,410
Thank you for the gift.

5224
05:48:25,910 --> 05:48:26,270
Nice.

5225
05:48:28,070 --> 05:48:29,330
We're so close, guys.

5226
05:48:29,450 --> 05:48:30,390
I'm starting to get hungry for dinner.

5227
05:48:30,850 --> 05:48:31,330
Oh my gosh.

5228
05:48:33,110 --> 05:48:34,490
Wait, did I already do it?

5229
05:48:34,530 --> 05:48:35,230
Yeah, I think so.

5230
05:48:35,370 --> 05:48:35,950
OK, there we go.

5231
05:48:37,210 --> 05:48:38,110
What mission are we on?

5232
05:48:40,630 --> 05:48:40,990
17!

5233
05:48:41,690 --> 05:48:42,410
Oh my god.

5234
05:48:43,830 --> 05:48:44,530
Yeah!

5235
05:48:45,310 --> 05:48:47,930
Evil must be opposed and destroyed.

5236
05:48:50,670 --> 05:48:52,290
I have 8000.

5237
05:48:52,690 --> 05:48:53,570
What can I get?

5238
05:48:54,270 --> 05:48:58,330
I almost kind of want to get... Maybe like some vital stars?

5239
05:48:59,510 --> 05:49:01,210
I don't know, since I have nothing.

5240
05:49:03,490 --> 05:49:04,890
And some...

5241
05:49:05,830 --> 05:49:07,730
Some devil stars.

5242
05:49:11,090 --> 05:49:12,830
Stars might save your ass.

5243
05:49:12,930 --> 05:49:13,530
I agree.

5244
05:49:17,510 --> 05:49:19,550
It went up in price!

5245
05:49:19,730 --> 05:49:20,450
You asshole!

5246
05:49:21,930 --> 05:49:23,270
Oh my god!

5247
05:49:23,330 --> 05:49:24,350
It's so expensive!

5248
05:49:37,060 --> 05:49:37,800
Alrighty.

5249
05:49:42,840 --> 05:49:43,260
Let's go.

5250
05:49:49,810 --> 05:49:51,070
You hear that?

5251
05:49:51,670 --> 05:49:52,510
It's my controller.

5252
05:50:21,740 --> 05:50:23,480
Why doesn't he have any voice?

5253
05:50:23,680 --> 05:50:25,280
Like, why didn't he make any sound?

5254
05:50:39,220 --> 05:50:39,880
It's power!

5255
05:50:46,360 --> 05:50:50,420
He's giving Disney... Disney villain.

5256
05:50:51,360 --> 05:50:53,880
There's one Disney villain that sounds just like that.

5257
05:50:53,940 --> 05:50:54,400
Laffy!

5258
05:50:54,520 --> 05:50:55,080
Thanks for the gifted!

5259
05:50:55,540 --> 05:50:56,920
Like Jafar or something.

5260
05:51:03,140 --> 05:51:03,780
You!

5261
05:51:03,780 --> 05:51:04,620
You!

5262
05:51:06,540 --> 05:51:07,940
You!

5263
05:51:09,040 --> 05:51:13,140
Oh he gave you the sexy coin.

5264
05:51:20,020 --> 05:51:21,420
Nice!

5265
05:51:27,060 --> 05:51:28,200
A false coin.

5266
05:51:34,580 --> 05:51:35,380
Heads or tails?

5267
05:51:35,700 --> 05:51:36,200
Oh yeah!

5268
05:51:36,380 --> 05:51:36,700
Oh ok.

5269
05:51:38,180 --> 05:51:38,560
Wait...

5270
05:51:45,950 --> 05:51:46,910
Who am I fighting?

5271
05:51:47,070 --> 05:51:48,030
I can't see anything.

5272
05:51:48,430 --> 05:51:48,810
Oh ok.

5273
05:51:51,770 --> 05:51:53,150
Oh my goodness, good thing I drove.

5274
05:52:00,460 --> 05:52:01,780
Wait, who are these people?

5275
05:52:02,880 --> 05:52:03,980
Who are these guys?

5276
05:52:05,200 --> 05:52:06,780
Where's the guy I'm supposed to be fighting?

5277
05:52:06,860 --> 05:52:07,820
I thought I was fighting him.

5278
05:52:07,880 --> 05:52:09,200
Oh he's taking his little nap.

5279
05:52:11,800 --> 05:52:12,680
Ok, understandable.

5280
05:52:22,060 --> 05:52:24,040
Oh yeah, you're trying to...

5281
05:52:24,840 --> 05:52:26,600
Ok, there is backup dancers.

5282
05:52:30,330 --> 05:52:34,170
Let's just take these guys and get more DT.

5283
05:52:36,790 --> 05:52:37,790
Oh, ouch ouch.

5284
05:52:38,810 --> 05:52:40,430
I don't know what hit me, but something did.

5285
05:52:40,590 --> 05:52:41,050
Oh, him.

5286
05:52:41,410 --> 05:52:42,350
He's shooting at me.

5287
05:52:43,190 --> 05:52:44,350
Golly's guy, I think.

5288
05:52:46,330 --> 05:52:47,910
And then he summons more.

5289
05:52:48,850 --> 05:52:51,610
And then I dodge them.

5290
05:52:52,610 --> 05:52:54,450
And he sometimes... Oh my gosh.

5291
05:52:55,490 --> 05:52:57,290
He's got his little jesters.

5292
05:52:57,750 --> 05:52:58,510
What is this?

5293
05:52:58,750 --> 05:53:01,070
Why are there clowns all of a sudden?

5294
05:53:01,430 --> 05:53:03,130
This doesn't fit his image at all.

5295
05:53:04,590 --> 05:53:06,030
This is so stupid.

5296
05:53:09,510 --> 05:53:10,690
Oh, dang it.

5297
05:53:11,250 --> 05:53:11,730
You know what?

5298
05:53:11,770 --> 05:53:12,090
Screw it.

5299
05:53:13,350 --> 05:53:14,310
Ah, ok.

5300
05:53:15,030 --> 05:53:17,810
Alright, he's gonna summon more, but...

5301
05:53:17,810 --> 05:53:19,110
I wanna take these guys out.

5302
05:53:19,150 --> 05:53:21,210
I don't know if he can summon more of these guys.

5303
05:53:22,690 --> 05:53:23,410
Ouch, ouch ouch.

5304
05:53:28,110 --> 05:53:28,770
It does?

5305
05:53:28,910 --> 05:53:31,810
You think clowns suit this guy?

5306
05:53:43,360 --> 05:53:45,640
You see this man and you're just like...

5307
05:53:50,020 --> 05:53:50,940
Oh, ok.

5308
05:53:51,120 --> 05:53:52,000
Let's not use the sword.

5309
05:53:55,780 --> 05:53:58,980
Arius is just on the other side of the screen like, I'm bored.

5310
05:54:00,380 --> 05:54:00,700
Ok.

5311
05:54:01,440 --> 05:54:03,820
At least we're getting more stuff.

5312
05:54:05,780 --> 05:54:07,640
I just... Oh, we took one down.

5313
05:54:09,440 --> 05:54:10,100
Oh my gosh.

5314
05:54:10,200 --> 05:54:10,720
Oh, nevermind.

5315
05:54:10,860 --> 05:54:12,020
I was gonna say we took two down.

5316
05:54:12,280 --> 05:54:13,280
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

5317
05:54:17,240 --> 05:54:21,280
Ok, I think he can only summon in the monkeys.

5318
05:54:22,900 --> 05:54:23,600
Oh my god.

5319
05:54:23,660 --> 05:54:24,600
Oh my god, please.

5320
05:54:38,140 --> 05:54:39,960
Oh gosh, please.

5321
05:54:42,000 --> 05:54:44,300
I'm trying to get rid of as many... Oh my gosh.

5322
05:54:44,420 --> 05:54:46,560
I'm trying to get rid of as many enemies as possible.

5323
05:54:46,640 --> 05:54:47,680
Like these guys especially.

5324
05:54:48,220 --> 05:54:48,440
Ok.

5325
05:54:48,840 --> 05:54:50,640
So then we can go and focus on him.

5326
05:54:52,000 --> 05:54:52,420
Oh my god.

5327
05:55:12,400 --> 05:55:13,560
Jake, thanks for the five gift.

5328
05:55:16,720 --> 05:55:17,560
Oh, shoot.

5329
05:55:26,300 --> 05:55:27,460
Where did he go?

5330
05:55:30,760 --> 05:55:32,660
Surely somewhere I'll be able to see him.

5331
05:55:32,740 --> 05:55:33,340
Oh, there he is.

5332
05:55:37,670 --> 05:55:38,110
No!

5333
05:55:38,490 --> 05:55:39,270
Leave him alone!

5334
05:55:39,630 --> 05:55:41,310
There we go.

5335
05:55:57,250 --> 05:55:59,070
You're not sitting down anymore, right?

5336
05:55:59,230 --> 05:56:00,750
Oh, you shot me in the air.

5337
05:56:01,510 --> 05:56:02,430
I don't like that.

5338
05:56:02,430 --> 05:56:02,550
I don't like that.

5339
05:56:14,340 --> 05:56:15,540
That's ok, he's almost dead.

5340
05:56:23,260 --> 05:56:24,220
My life!

5341
05:56:29,100 --> 05:56:31,000
I was going to be king.

5342
05:56:31,000 --> 05:56:31,740
King!

5343
05:56:37,840 --> 05:56:38,620
I

5344
05:56:42,970 --> 05:56:45,190
was going to be king!

5345
05:56:48,290 --> 05:56:49,850
Guys, we are so close!

5346
05:56:51,770 --> 05:56:52,590
Let's go!

5347
05:56:54,170 --> 05:56:55,170
Here's your crown.

5348
05:57:01,880 --> 05:57:03,080
Yeah, I did.

5349
05:57:04,820 --> 05:57:05,520
Then...

5350
05:57:08,080 --> 05:57:09,120
What's that?

5351
05:57:11,440 --> 05:57:12,140
What?

5352
05:57:35,500 --> 05:57:37,260
Who are you talking about?

5353
05:57:39,800 --> 05:57:44,960
You literally told us that at the beginning of the game.

5354
05:57:45,260 --> 05:57:48,680
You told us that at the beginning of the game.

5355
05:57:49,180 --> 05:57:51,260
Is that supposed to be a twist?

5356
05:57:51,260 --> 05:57:51,640
Is that supposed to be a twist?

5357
05:57:56,840 --> 05:57:58,080
I can't.

5358
05:58:03,690 --> 05:58:04,590
What's that twist?

5359
05:58:10,490 --> 05:58:12,310
So this game isn't very good.

5360
05:58:12,650 --> 05:58:13,850
I'm having fun.

5361
05:58:18,070 --> 05:58:19,470
I'm having fun.

5362
05:58:20,230 --> 05:58:25,250
Oh no, is it another cosmic space final battle event again?

5363
05:58:27,490 --> 05:58:30,630
I probably didn't expect anyone to pay attention to the story.

5364
05:58:32,650 --> 05:58:34,090
Are we going to be fighting together?

5365
05:58:37,590 --> 05:58:47,930
These in-game cutscenes versus the rendered ones that are really pixelated.

5366
05:58:49,570 --> 05:58:50,830
It's so funny.

5367
05:58:55,090 --> 05:58:56,930
She's crying.

5368
05:59:05,070 --> 05:59:06,250
It's a single tear.

5369
05:59:10,370 --> 05:59:11,590
How do you know?

5370
05:59:11,650 --> 05:59:13,810
You don't know that you could become a demon, no?

5371
05:59:25,650 --> 05:59:27,190
I like the music.

5372
05:59:27,350 --> 05:59:28,250
So romantic.

5373
05:59:28,370 --> 05:59:28,910
Oh my gosh.

5374
05:59:34,090 --> 05:59:35,790
It's the same on both sides.

5375
05:59:54,930 --> 05:59:58,750
Don't you want to hear the story about Sparda?

5376
06:00:02,640 --> 06:00:03,680
Mission 18.

5377
06:00:03,820 --> 06:00:07,160
The hunter shall surpass all who came before him.

5378
06:00:08,520 --> 06:00:10,240
Wait, how much money?

5379
06:00:10,940 --> 06:00:11,880
I could get a blorb.

5380
06:00:14,180 --> 06:00:18,200
How stacked realistically do I need to be for this fight, you guys?

5381
06:00:20,660 --> 06:00:21,940
Realistically how stacked?

5382
06:00:22,240 --> 06:00:26,300
I like Lucia's design and gameplay, but she's shackled to this game sadly.

5383
06:00:26,300 --> 06:00:29,580
Also, now you have to play as her to truly... No.

5384
06:00:29,800 --> 06:00:34,300
Anybody who tells me that I haven't truly beaten the game...

5385
06:00:35,660 --> 06:00:38,300
When I beat the game...

5386
06:00:39,000 --> 06:00:41,380
It's just... It's just an asshole.

5387
06:00:44,300 --> 06:00:48,140
I love how it's nothing, honestly, and the final boss is actually challenging.

5388
06:00:48,460 --> 06:00:49,580
We're right next to each other.

5389
06:01:00,260 --> 06:01:02,040
Vtuber is a DMC gamer?

5390
06:01:02,200 --> 06:01:04,920
How many other Vtubers have played DMC2?

5391
06:01:05,620 --> 06:01:10,880
How many gamers, how many people that are fans of Devil May Cry have actually played DMC2?

5392
06:01:13,760 --> 06:01:16,600
Final boss is the only well-designed enemy in the whole game.

5393
06:01:17,980 --> 06:01:22,980
Guys, I came in here... I think maybe some people misunderstand a little bit.

5394
06:01:23,940 --> 06:01:29,060
I came in to understand why people don't like DMC2.

5395
06:01:30,580 --> 06:01:32,560
I'm not here to complete DMC2.

5396
06:01:37,300 --> 06:01:38,680
I think we're fine for now.

5397
06:01:38,760 --> 06:01:38,980
We'll see.

5398
06:01:39,360 --> 06:01:41,280
If I have to come back... If I die, I die.

5399
06:01:42,960 --> 06:01:44,300
I'm so hungry though.

5400
06:01:44,980 --> 06:01:45,980
My tummy is growling.

5401
06:01:48,580 --> 06:01:49,020
Am

5402
06:01:53,560 --> 06:01:54,440
I here for the finale?

5403
06:02:00,160 --> 06:02:01,100
Oh my god.

5404
06:02:01,820 --> 06:02:02,000
Oh.

5405
06:02:03,200 --> 06:02:03,640
Argosax.

5406
06:02:06,140 --> 06:02:07,780
Wait, it's this guy from before.

5407
06:02:10,860 --> 06:02:12,500
Wait, it's this guy from before.

5408
06:02:12,720 --> 06:02:13,240
Oh my gosh.

5409
06:02:15,720 --> 06:02:16,580
No way.

5410
06:02:20,700 --> 06:02:22,760
Wait, which boss did I hate the most?

5411
06:02:23,060 --> 06:02:23,540
Oh no.

5412
06:02:24,320 --> 06:02:26,200
I don't understand how to avoid this one.

5413
06:02:27,020 --> 06:02:28,560
Watch along of Lucia's cutscenes.

5414
06:02:29,340 --> 06:02:29,640
Maybe.

5415
06:02:30,540 --> 06:02:31,560
Maybe we can do that.

5416
06:02:31,800 --> 06:02:32,340
Oh my gosh.

5417
06:02:32,940 --> 06:02:33,460
Tonight.

5418
06:02:34,180 --> 06:02:34,560
Oh my god.

5419
06:02:37,200 --> 06:02:38,880
But I'm also really hungry.

5420
06:02:44,330 --> 06:02:46,150
I've never seen green before.

5421
06:02:50,440 --> 06:02:50,960
Wait.

5422
06:02:51,540 --> 06:02:51,720
Oh.

5423
06:02:54,720 --> 06:02:55,420
What's happening?

5424
06:02:55,540 --> 06:02:56,160
Oh, he's gone.

5425
06:02:56,160 --> 06:02:56,200
He's gone.

5426
06:03:00,680 --> 06:03:02,040
Which one was this one?

5427
06:03:03,960 --> 06:03:04,960
Oh, this is the monkey.

5428
06:03:09,050 --> 06:03:10,690
But you can't... Oh my gosh.

5429
06:03:11,010 --> 06:03:11,450
Oh, ouch.

5430
06:03:16,200 --> 06:03:18,700
Okay, you have to give me a chance to shoot monkey, okay?

5431
06:03:20,440 --> 06:03:22,180
We can't double up.

5432
06:03:22,580 --> 06:03:22,940
No, no.

5433
06:03:23,020 --> 06:03:24,020
Monkey time right now.

5434
06:03:24,520 --> 06:03:25,800
Right now is monkey time.

5435
06:03:33,150 --> 06:03:34,370
Thanks for the super chat.

5436
06:03:34,450 --> 06:03:35,990
I can't read them right now though.

5437
06:03:37,810 --> 06:03:39,910
Thank you, but I can't read them.

5438
06:03:45,680 --> 06:03:46,560
Oh, is he down?

5439
06:03:47,360 --> 06:03:47,740
Okay.

5440
06:03:48,280 --> 06:03:49,300
And then he melts.

5441
06:03:52,320 --> 06:03:53,320
Argo sucks.

5442
06:03:53,440 --> 06:03:53,700
Yeah.

5443
06:03:55,560 --> 06:03:56,600
Oh yeah, alright.

5444
06:03:58,200 --> 06:04:00,000
We have a little second, a little break.

5445
06:04:00,000 --> 06:04:00,040
Break.

5446
06:04:02,820 --> 06:04:03,700
Oh my gosh.

5447
06:04:03,960 --> 06:04:04,660
Which guy is this?

5448
06:04:04,740 --> 06:04:06,180
Oh, this is phantom.

5449
06:04:08,240 --> 06:04:08,940
Oh, shit.

5450
06:04:34,790 --> 06:04:36,550
Oh, three this time.

5451
06:04:38,490 --> 06:04:39,530
Getting fancy.

5452
06:04:40,350 --> 06:04:41,130
Getting fancy.

5453
06:04:41,530 --> 06:04:43,170
I tried, I tried, don't fade.

5454
06:04:43,490 --> 06:04:44,230
I was too slow.

5455
06:04:44,990 --> 06:04:45,770
I was too slow.

5456
06:04:53,400 --> 06:04:54,760
I got it this time.

5457
06:04:59,380 --> 06:04:59,640
Okay.

5458
06:05:12,780 --> 06:05:14,480
Oh, nevermind.

5459
06:05:14,760 --> 06:05:15,100
Canceled.

5460
06:05:21,300 --> 06:05:22,700
Argo sucks!

5461
06:05:24,400 --> 06:05:25,140
Stupid!

5462
06:05:26,440 --> 06:05:27,880
Oh, nevermind.

5463
06:05:28,420 --> 06:05:30,400
Wow, that was horrible timing on my part.

5464
06:05:35,800 --> 06:05:36,840
Oh no.

5465
06:05:37,760 --> 06:05:40,560
Okay, let's do this one.

5466
06:05:40,900 --> 06:05:41,420
Oh god.

5467
06:05:46,900 --> 06:05:48,380
I hate.

5468
06:05:48,380 --> 06:05:48,420
What?

5469
06:05:53,240 --> 06:05:54,940
There's a grorb all the way over there.

5470
06:05:55,000 --> 06:05:55,540
There is.

5471
06:05:56,320 --> 06:05:56,980
Oh my gosh.

5472
06:06:01,990 --> 06:06:03,910
I think it's just the tentacle.

5473
06:06:05,710 --> 06:06:07,850
If it's just the tentacle...

5474
06:06:09,450 --> 06:06:11,950
I don't feel so bad about it, I think.

5475
06:06:17,300 --> 06:06:18,700
Wait, can he even reach me?

5476
06:06:21,680 --> 06:06:22,980
Can he even reach me?

5477
06:06:24,600 --> 06:06:25,900
Am I doing damage?

5478
06:06:26,740 --> 06:06:28,500
Guys, I couldn't tell if I was doing damage.

5479
06:06:28,720 --> 06:06:30,720
Oh, the thing is shaking, so I guess so.

5480
06:06:33,540 --> 06:06:34,680
But it's shaking.

5481
06:06:38,520 --> 06:06:39,440
Oh my god!

5482
06:06:39,760 --> 06:06:40,300
The bait!

5483
06:06:40,520 --> 06:06:41,320
I thought he was dead!

5484
06:06:45,920 --> 06:06:47,180
I am doing damage.

5485
06:06:47,260 --> 06:06:50,100
Yeah, it's just going down really slow.

5486
06:06:56,230 --> 06:06:59,910
I honestly can't remember the other two guys.

5487
06:07:00,110 --> 06:07:02,410
I can't remember who that fire guy is at all.

5488
06:07:06,460 --> 06:07:08,280
This is just ridiculous.

5489
06:07:08,600 --> 06:07:10,600
I'm just jumping and shooting.

5490
06:07:11,540 --> 06:07:11,780
Oops.

5491
06:07:12,380 --> 06:07:13,760
Too high of a jump.

5492
06:07:14,500 --> 06:07:15,520
Jumping and shooting.

5493
06:07:15,840 --> 06:07:16,700
Jumping and shooting.

5494
06:07:17,740 --> 06:07:18,980
I don't think he can reach me.

5495
06:07:21,260 --> 06:07:23,740
As long as I jump, I feel at least safe.

5496
06:07:24,900 --> 06:07:25,780
Let's try.

5497
06:07:30,980 --> 06:07:32,720
The oil rig.

5498
06:07:32,860 --> 06:07:34,180
That guy, that's right.

5499
06:07:36,720 --> 06:07:37,540
No way.

5500
06:08:05,480 --> 06:08:11,060
Wait, I beat him before by being really far away, so what do I do here?

5501
06:08:30,000 --> 06:08:30,380
Just kidding.

5502
06:08:46,770 --> 06:08:48,170
I don't remember this.

5503
06:08:49,350 --> 06:08:50,690
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5504
06:08:53,930 --> 06:08:57,410
This is... this is...

5505
06:08:57,410 --> 06:08:59,790
What was his name?

5506
06:09:00,370 --> 06:09:00,750
Griffin?

5507
06:09:01,830 --> 06:09:02,790
From the first game.

5508
06:09:10,560 --> 06:09:11,200
Oh my god.

5509
06:09:11,380 --> 06:09:12,160
That was close.

5510
06:09:20,150 --> 06:09:20,890
Oh my god.

5511
06:09:20,950 --> 06:09:21,210
Ouch!

5512
06:09:32,760 --> 06:09:33,480
Okay.

5513
06:09:44,730 --> 06:09:46,170
Screw it!

5514
06:09:46,530 --> 06:09:47,450
Just take the hits!

5515
06:09:48,210 --> 06:09:49,050
Oh, we did it.

5516
06:09:52,630 --> 06:09:53,610
Now what?

5517
06:10:00,930 --> 06:10:02,310
The brain.

5518
06:10:04,810 --> 06:10:05,850
Phase 2?

5519
06:10:06,030 --> 06:10:06,270
Okay.

5520
06:10:13,410 --> 06:10:16,370
They just made everybody sexy in this game, huh?

5521
06:10:18,250 --> 06:10:18,770
No!

5522
06:10:20,670 --> 06:10:22,830
No, don't take her boobs!

5523
06:10:27,530 --> 06:10:29,710
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

5524
06:10:38,770 --> 06:10:40,250
I'm not doing any damage.

5525
06:10:42,290 --> 06:10:43,390
Oh, her boobs are back.

5526
06:10:45,570 --> 06:10:46,310
Oh my gosh.

5527
06:10:46,490 --> 06:10:47,170
Please, please.

5528
06:10:51,390 --> 06:10:52,150
Oh my god.

5529
06:10:52,290 --> 06:10:52,530
What?

5530
06:10:54,630 --> 06:10:56,870
Guys, I don't want to have to redo phase 1.

5531
06:10:57,110 --> 06:10:58,750
I really don't want to have to do that again.

5532
06:11:03,940 --> 06:11:04,640
Oh, shoot.

5533
06:11:05,140 --> 06:11:05,520
Damn it.

5534
06:11:06,400 --> 06:11:06,640
Okay.

5535
06:11:18,980 --> 06:11:19,380
Ouch!

5536
06:11:29,640 --> 06:11:31,720
I don't want to use it and waste it.

5537
06:11:33,600 --> 06:11:35,180
Damn, that didn't give me a whole ton.

5538
06:11:36,020 --> 06:11:36,440
But okay.

5539
06:11:48,180 --> 06:11:48,700
Ouch!

5540
06:11:54,950 --> 06:11:56,350
How do I avoid this?

5541
06:11:56,750 --> 06:11:57,550
Oh my god.

5542
06:12:18,080 --> 06:12:20,460
Wow, it was only one hour over the average.

5543
06:12:21,700 --> 06:12:22,700
It's not bad for me.

5544
06:12:22,700 --> 06:12:22,760
Damn.

5545
06:12:26,520 --> 06:12:27,240
Yay!

5546
06:12:34,800 --> 06:12:35,680
Thanks to the 5 Crystals.

5547
06:12:36,220 --> 06:12:37,420
The sword I never use.

5548
06:12:37,840 --> 06:12:38,580
Oh, yeah!

5549
06:12:44,980 --> 06:12:45,700
Why?

5550
06:12:46,100 --> 06:12:47,860
Where is this coming from?

5551
06:12:51,300 --> 06:12:53,060
If I held... What?

5552
06:12:53,840 --> 06:12:55,740
Why did I never use that before?

5553
06:13:00,900 --> 06:13:01,460
Jackpot!

5554
06:13:07,520 --> 06:13:11,300
And then you drive off into the... Hellscape?

5555
06:13:11,540 --> 06:13:12,240
Not the sunset?

5556
06:13:27,500 --> 06:13:28,360
That's it?

5557
06:14:02,600 --> 06:14:04,000
I like the music here.

5558
06:14:18,400 --> 06:14:19,840
Well guys, that was a game.

5559
06:14:20,920 --> 06:14:22,980
Canonically, now he just sort of chills in hell.

5560
06:14:24,020 --> 06:14:25,400
Or does some other stuff for a while.

5561
06:14:25,840 --> 06:14:26,200
Hooray!

5562
06:14:27,620 --> 06:14:28,660
Just got back from the toilet.

5563
06:14:28,720 --> 06:14:29,320
What did I miss?

5564
06:14:30,920 --> 06:14:31,640
Nothing much.

5565
06:14:32,140 --> 06:14:32,940
Oh, my bad.

5566
06:14:51,020 --> 06:14:51,380
Congratulations.

5567
06:14:51,740 --> 06:14:52,420
Thank you.

5568
06:14:52,800 --> 06:14:53,820
Charlie, welcome to membership.

5569
06:14:54,020 --> 06:14:54,320
Thank you.

5570
06:14:54,340 --> 06:14:55,620
And Alexander, thank you for the pink.

5571
06:14:58,360 --> 06:15:00,260
Guys, I must not be a devil because...

5572
06:15:01,400 --> 06:15:02,120
I'm crying.

5573
06:15:06,180 --> 06:15:07,140
What do

5574
06:15:13,400 --> 06:15:14,300
you mean that's it?

5575
06:15:18,920 --> 06:15:20,720
Now I understand why people hate this game.

5576
06:15:22,080 --> 06:15:23,640
Yuma, welcome to membership.

5577
06:15:23,900 --> 06:15:24,300
Thank you.

5578
06:15:24,560 --> 06:15:25,680
Peter, thanks for 7 months.

5579
06:15:36,180 --> 06:15:39,600
You went through all that and they couldn't even give you a decent ending.

5580
06:15:40,820 --> 06:15:42,060
Have a dessert, Minky.

5581
06:15:42,200 --> 06:15:42,960
Thank you for the Minky.

5582
06:15:47,900 --> 06:15:49,460
Congrats on finishing your torture session.

5583
06:15:50,240 --> 06:15:51,780
Feel like a DMC fan now, Minto?

5584
06:15:52,160 --> 06:15:53,780
I gotta play the other games.

5585
06:15:54,300 --> 06:15:55,560
I'm just doing them in order.

5586
06:15:56,760 --> 06:15:57,800
Win Lucia disc?

5587
06:16:00,880 --> 06:16:01,360
Lucia?

5588
06:16:01,580 --> 06:16:02,700
Gosh, I always call her Lucia.

5589
06:16:03,140 --> 06:16:03,560
Lucia.

5590
06:16:09,270 --> 06:16:09,990
We'll see.

5591
06:16:11,170 --> 06:16:13,770
I might record myself playing it.

5592
06:16:15,410 --> 06:16:16,870
And then upload it while I'm gone.

5593
06:16:18,330 --> 06:16:18,870
Maybe.

5594
06:16:21,270 --> 06:16:22,890
Today's my birthday, can I get a...

5595
06:16:22,890 --> 06:16:24,430
Wondering if I can get a happy birthday from my Oshi.

5596
06:16:25,010 --> 06:16:26,950
Mr. Yamiya, happy birthday!

5597
06:16:27,670 --> 06:16:28,970
Oh my gosh, wait, there's multiple birthdays.

5598
06:16:30,230 --> 06:16:31,330
Soma, happy birthday!

5599
06:16:32,470 --> 06:16:33,890
First, we'll do Soma.

5600
06:16:34,010 --> 06:16:34,290
Demonstrate.

5601
06:16:35,090 --> 06:16:37,410
Happy birthday to you.

5602
06:16:38,510 --> 06:16:41,090
Happy birthday to you.

5603
06:16:41,510 --> 06:16:44,310
Happy birthday, dear Soma.

5604
06:16:45,150 --> 06:16:45,390
Happy birthday, dear Soma.

5605
06:16:45,390 --> 06:16:48,930
Happy birthday to you.

5606
06:16:49,850 --> 06:16:52,490
One more time!

5607
06:16:52,950 --> 06:16:55,570
Happy birthday to you.

5608
06:16:56,190 --> 06:16:58,710
Happy birthday to you.

5609
06:16:59,230 --> 06:17:02,050
Happy birthday, Mr. Yamiya.

5610
06:17:03,270 --> 06:17:06,550
Happy birthday to you.

5611
06:17:08,350 --> 06:17:09,370
Happy birthday!

5612
06:17:11,550 --> 06:17:13,330
It's funny because...

5613
06:17:13,330 --> 06:17:15,330
I'll see people being like...

5614
06:17:15,330 --> 06:17:17,810
Lucia has no...

5615
06:17:17,810 --> 06:17:18,890
Narrative significance.

5616
06:17:19,250 --> 06:17:20,950
And then other people being like...

5617
06:17:22,810 --> 06:17:24,270
Lucia's route is faster.

5618
06:17:24,730 --> 06:17:26,070
And then other people being like...

5619
06:17:26,070 --> 06:17:27,710
Lucia's route is way slower.

5620
06:17:28,430 --> 06:17:31,370
And just so many mixed messages.

5621
06:17:31,570 --> 06:17:34,330
I never know if you guys are trying to get me to play it.

5622
06:17:34,590 --> 06:17:35,330
Because you're like...

5623
06:17:37,350 --> 06:17:40,510
There's actually more information if you play her route.

5624
06:17:40,510 --> 06:17:41,690
Or if it's like...

5625
06:17:41,690 --> 06:17:43,030
We want you to suffer.

5626
06:17:43,350 --> 06:17:46,030
And we're gaslighting you into playing it.

5627
06:17:48,590 --> 06:17:49,790
I've been wondering...

5628
06:17:49,790 --> 06:17:51,570
If you're playing all of the Devil May Cry games...

5629
06:17:51,570 --> 06:17:52,590
Does that include DMC?

5630
06:17:52,850 --> 06:17:54,710
Or are we ignoring the reboot?

5631
06:17:56,730 --> 06:17:57,130
Probably...

5632
06:17:57,130 --> 06:17:58,710
I have no plans to play it for right now.

5633
06:17:59,370 --> 06:18:01,490
The actual ending is only shown when you beat both campaigns.

5634
06:18:02,950 --> 06:18:03,190
I see.

5635
06:18:03,230 --> 06:18:04,010
I don't believe you.

5636
06:18:04,270 --> 06:18:05,170
I don't believe you.

5637
06:18:05,230 --> 06:18:05,710
That's the thing.

5638
06:18:05,710 --> 06:18:06,570
I don't believe you.

5639
06:18:07,370 --> 06:18:09,030
I actually don't believe you.

5640
06:18:09,090 --> 06:18:09,590
I'm sorry.

5641
06:18:14,330 --> 06:18:16,630
Like, people say so many things.

5642
06:18:17,890 --> 06:18:19,170
I just don't believe it.

5643
06:18:20,370 --> 06:18:22,590
Congrats on beating the Valley of DMC.

5644
06:18:22,830 --> 06:18:24,270
It's an uphill from here.

5645
06:18:24,490 --> 06:18:25,570
Wait, isn't... No.

5646
06:18:26,310 --> 06:18:27,250
It should be a downhill.

5647
06:18:28,310 --> 06:18:29,270
We went uphill.

5648
06:18:30,270 --> 06:18:31,910
Villain, uphill is the hard part.

5649
06:18:31,970 --> 06:18:33,710
And then it's the downhill that's the good part.

5650
06:18:33,710 --> 06:18:34,350
Right?

5651
06:18:34,830 --> 06:18:36,110
It's all downhill from here.

5652
06:18:36,490 --> 06:18:37,890
I think you mean uphill.

5653
06:18:38,090 --> 06:18:39,930
You're thinking uphill as in like it gets better.

5654
06:18:40,310 --> 06:18:41,230
Because you're going up.

5655
06:18:41,310 --> 06:18:42,870
But it's the opposite.

5656
06:18:49,200 --> 06:18:51,720
Now that you beat DMC2 as Dante, you can play as Trish.

5657
06:18:52,780 --> 06:18:53,220
Trish?

5658
06:18:56,180 --> 06:18:57,040
Wait, Trish?

5659
06:18:57,500 --> 06:18:57,940
This?

5660
06:18:58,740 --> 06:19:00,480
Well, that happened.

5661
06:19:00,540 --> 06:19:01,600
A summary of DMC2.

5662
06:19:01,900 --> 06:19:02,600
Still a fun stream.

5663
06:19:02,680 --> 06:19:03,480
Thanks to you, Minto.

5664
06:19:03,660 --> 06:19:04,260
Thank you.

5665
06:19:07,720 --> 06:19:08,900
Downhill is bad.

5666
06:19:09,200 --> 06:19:09,600
No.

5667
06:19:10,240 --> 06:19:13,280
When people say it's all downhill from here...

5668
06:19:14,400 --> 06:19:16,620
It means that it's easier, right?

5669
06:19:18,360 --> 06:19:19,340
Or rather...

5670
06:19:19,340 --> 06:19:20,000
Things get...

5671
06:19:20,000 --> 06:19:21,940
Because nobody...

5672
06:19:21,940 --> 06:19:23,580
Imagine you're riding a bike.

5673
06:19:23,780 --> 06:19:25,700
You're riding a bike and you're going uphill.

5674
06:19:26,040 --> 06:19:27,400
And you're just like...

5675
06:19:27,400 --> 06:19:28,800
It's hard.

5676
06:19:29,160 --> 06:19:31,200
And then when you go downhill, you're just like...

5677
06:19:31,200 --> 06:19:32,200
This is so easy.

5678
06:19:32,200 --> 06:19:32,440
It's so easy.

5679
06:19:44,260 --> 06:19:45,800
We're not on a bike though.

5680
06:19:46,180 --> 06:19:47,220
It's the metaphor.

5681
06:19:47,820 --> 06:19:49,660
We're not actually going downhill either.

5682
06:19:51,440 --> 06:19:54,020
All downhill from here saying it's completely out of control.

5683
06:19:54,320 --> 06:19:55,660
Wait, did I try mansplaining?

5684
06:19:58,340 --> 06:19:59,540
Wait, am I wrong?

5685
06:20:00,780 --> 06:20:02,120
Are you going to die on that hill?

5686
06:20:02,360 --> 06:20:03,960
Am I wrong?

5687
06:20:05,160 --> 06:20:06,560
But I've always heard...

5688
06:20:06,560 --> 06:20:09,440
Wait, but I've heard when it's all downhill from here, it's better.

5689
06:20:16,090 --> 06:20:16,970
I'm mansplaining.

5690
06:20:18,010 --> 06:20:18,850
I'm wrong!

5691
06:20:26,460 --> 06:20:28,480
If you're saying it gets easier, downhill is better.

5692
06:20:28,580 --> 06:20:30,340
If you're saying it gets better, uphill is better.

5693
06:20:30,760 --> 06:20:32,280
Both work in different contexts.

5694
06:20:34,100 --> 06:20:34,480
Okay.

5695
06:20:43,760 --> 06:20:46,380
Only DFC game where pistols are strong.

5696
06:20:47,520 --> 06:20:49,620
You can play as Trish if you finish on hard.

5697
06:20:49,700 --> 06:20:51,800
It didn't give me an option to choose a difficulty.

5698
06:20:54,520 --> 06:20:57,480
The DFC games from here are way better.

5699
06:20:57,740 --> 06:20:58,000
Yeah.

5700
06:20:58,820 --> 06:21:02,500
In my defense, the saying it's all downhill from here meant bad things.

5701
06:21:02,860 --> 06:21:03,580
Maybe it's regional.

5702
06:21:04,320 --> 06:21:04,760
I don't know.

5703
06:21:04,880 --> 06:21:05,300
No, villain.

5704
06:21:05,760 --> 06:21:06,420
I'm sorry.

5705
06:21:06,880 --> 06:21:07,340
I'm sorry.

5706
06:21:07,500 --> 06:21:08,960
You sent me such a nice super chat.

5707
06:21:10,120 --> 06:21:12,040
And I was just like, no, you're wrong!

5708
06:21:12,140 --> 06:21:12,560
Immediately.

5709
06:21:13,080 --> 06:21:13,880
I apologize.

5710
06:21:14,220 --> 06:21:15,960
I sincerely actually apologize.

5711
06:21:16,120 --> 06:21:16,720
I'm so sorry.

5712
06:21:16,720 --> 06:21:16,780
I'm so sorry.

5713
06:21:19,740 --> 06:21:22,720
I can admit when I have goofed.

5714
06:21:26,300 --> 06:21:27,040
You're right.

5715
06:21:27,180 --> 06:21:30,140
But people misuse it so often that a lot of people don't get it.

5716
06:21:30,240 --> 06:21:31,020
Wait, I'm right?

5717
06:21:34,240 --> 06:21:36,040
I don't know anything anymore.

5718
06:21:36,620 --> 06:21:37,800
It's like, oh my gosh.

5719
06:21:37,940 --> 06:21:40,000
Maybe it's similar to the whole...

5720
06:21:40,000 --> 06:21:40,580
Okay, one thing.

5721
06:21:41,820 --> 06:21:42,740
Thanks, dry princess!

5722
06:21:42,740 --> 06:21:45,380
It's like a snowball going downhill.

5723
06:21:50,390 --> 06:21:52,990
One thing that's been like such an...

5724
06:21:52,990 --> 06:21:55,430
Something that annoys me so much is on TikTok.

5725
06:21:56,670 --> 06:21:58,870
Which, you know, already...

5726
06:21:58,870 --> 06:21:59,750
Starting off strong.

5727
06:22:00,270 --> 06:22:02,550
People will say POV...

5728
06:22:02,550 --> 06:22:03,270
Something, something, something.

5729
06:22:03,370 --> 06:22:05,930
You know, like, POV...

5730
06:22:05,930 --> 06:22:09,190
You are talking to me...

5731
06:22:09,190 --> 06:22:10,970
And I...

5732
06:22:10,970 --> 06:22:11,970
Um...

5733
06:22:11,970 --> 06:22:13,730
I'm hyperfixated.

5734
06:22:14,010 --> 06:22:15,910
I'm telling you about my hyperfixation.

5735
06:22:16,150 --> 06:22:18,570
But they don't understand what POV means.

5736
06:22:18,790 --> 06:22:20,370
It's not a POV.

5737
06:22:22,770 --> 06:22:25,690
Kids don't know what POV means anymore.

5738
06:22:25,850 --> 06:22:27,190
They don't understand that it's...

5739
06:22:27,190 --> 06:22:28,070
Point of view.

5740
06:22:28,610 --> 06:22:31,090
It's so actually frustrating.

5741
06:22:31,230 --> 06:22:33,210
That I'm like, no...

5742
06:22:34,010 --> 06:22:36,450
POV would be from my eyes.

5743
06:22:36,750 --> 06:22:38,770
Like, that doesn't make any sense.

5744
06:22:38,770 --> 06:22:40,790
Oh my gosh, it actually drives me insane.

5745
06:22:41,630 --> 06:22:41,970
You're right.

5746
06:22:42,050 --> 06:22:44,510
I blame Newfound Glory for this confusion.

5747
06:22:44,650 --> 06:22:46,050
Who's Newfound Glory?

5748
06:22:46,990 --> 06:22:47,910
Wait, isn't that a band?

5749
06:22:49,530 --> 06:22:50,010
The...

5750
06:22:50,010 --> 06:22:51,930
De-evolution of language.

5751
06:22:52,310 --> 06:22:53,810
It's just so frustrating.

5752
06:22:55,350 --> 06:22:56,690
But like, so...

5753
06:22:56,690 --> 06:22:58,430
Often I see it...

5754
06:22:59,330 --> 06:22:59,810
That...

5755
06:22:59,810 --> 06:23:02,550
In the past, I used to see people being like...

5756
06:23:02,550 --> 06:23:04,010
This is not what a POV is.

5757
06:23:04,070 --> 06:23:05,710
But I think people have just given up.

5758
06:23:06,790 --> 06:23:07,350
Like...

5759
06:23:07,350 --> 06:23:09,110
I think people have just given up.

5760
06:23:09,190 --> 06:23:10,110
It's so bad.

5761
06:23:11,790 --> 06:23:13,050
Am I out of touch?

5762
06:23:13,150 --> 06:23:14,670
No, it's actually not.

5763
06:23:14,770 --> 06:23:16,730
It's not out of touch, though.

5764
06:23:17,450 --> 06:23:18,870
Because it's like...

5765
06:23:18,870 --> 06:23:21,030
Actually just inaccurate.

5766
06:23:22,310 --> 06:23:23,990
I absolutely despise...

5767
06:23:23,990 --> 06:23:25,390
The rampant misuse of POV.

5768
06:23:25,670 --> 06:23:26,810
Maybe this is my...

5769
06:23:26,810 --> 06:23:29,250
Get off my lawn, kids moment.

5770
06:23:29,430 --> 06:23:30,530
But I don't care.

5771
06:23:30,750 --> 06:23:32,650
You know what, I will die on this uphill.

5772
06:23:32,650 --> 06:23:33,830
I will...

5773
06:23:34,650 --> 06:23:36,470
This is the uphill...

5774
06:23:36,470 --> 06:23:37,550
Oh, wait.

5775
06:23:39,610 --> 06:23:41,950
This is the uphill I will die on.

5776
06:23:42,090 --> 06:23:43,530
Now you guys say, what's uphill?

5777
06:23:53,120 --> 06:23:54,160
What's uphill?

5778
06:23:58,970 --> 06:24:00,270
Oh wait, hold on.

5779
06:24:12,620 --> 06:24:14,060
It's all...

5780
06:24:14,060 --> 06:24:15,240
Uphill from here.

5781
06:24:17,260 --> 06:24:18,040
Hank Hill?

5782
06:24:19,100 --> 06:24:19,820
Wait.

5783
06:24:19,820 --> 06:24:22,080
What's the guys from...

5784
06:24:22,080 --> 06:24:22,680
King of the Hill?

5785
06:24:22,940 --> 06:24:24,020
Hank Hill, right?

5786
06:24:38,670 --> 06:24:39,230
Yeah?

5787
06:24:39,450 --> 06:24:39,710
Okay.

5788
06:24:41,890 --> 06:24:43,250
So you're saying like...

5789
06:24:43,250 --> 06:24:43,770
What's uphill?

5790
06:24:44,530 --> 06:24:46,670
You're saying, what's up, Hank Hill?

5791
06:24:48,650 --> 06:24:51,050
I'm firing you into orbit so there are no hills.

5792
06:24:53,790 --> 06:24:55,530
You'll have to catch me first.

5793
06:25:02,130 --> 06:25:03,670
Your name isn't Hill.

5794
06:25:06,190 --> 06:25:07,150
It could be.

5795
06:25:09,730 --> 06:25:11,110
I could change my last name.

5796
06:25:11,990 --> 06:25:13,030
Chat, mine is too hard.

5797
06:25:13,130 --> 06:25:13,270
No!

5798
06:25:17,450 --> 06:25:21,790
When you are small like me though, every bump on the road is a hill to die on.

5799
06:25:26,990 --> 06:25:29,970
Guys, I think I'm gonna go eat dinner because it's getting kind of late for me.

5800
06:25:30,490 --> 06:25:31,230
This is fun.

5801
06:25:31,510 --> 06:25:32,970
Thank you guys for...

5802
06:25:32,970 --> 06:25:34,650
We finally experienced...

5803
06:25:34,650 --> 06:25:35,310
We did it!

5804
06:25:35,570 --> 06:25:36,570
One and done, baby!

5805
06:25:36,570 --> 06:25:38,150
We went and done...

5806
06:25:39,190 --> 06:25:40,390
Devil May Cry.

5807
06:25:41,130 --> 06:25:42,730
Next on to...

5808
06:25:42,730 --> 06:25:44,710
Devil May Cry 3.

5809
06:25:46,890 --> 06:25:49,250
POV, you're a wisp listening to me ramble.

5810
06:25:49,390 --> 06:25:49,530
Stop!

5811
06:25:52,170 --> 06:25:52,770
Sofa!

5812
06:25:52,910 --> 06:25:53,230
Oh my gosh!

5813
06:25:53,310 --> 06:25:54,190
Welcome to Babushan!

5814
06:25:54,470 --> 06:25:54,970
Thank you!

5815
06:25:54,990 --> 06:25:56,050
Happy birthday again!

5816
06:25:58,110 --> 06:25:59,150
Okey dokey.

5817
06:25:59,930 --> 06:26:00,530
Alright.

5818
06:26:01,310 --> 06:26:01,930
Good game.

5819
06:26:02,070 --> 06:26:03,330
Have a good game.

5820
06:26:04,190 --> 06:26:06,530
Your mind will be blown by 3.

5821
06:26:06,650 --> 06:26:07,270
I'm excited.

5822
06:26:07,750 --> 06:26:08,650
Very excited.

5823
06:26:09,350 --> 06:26:12,810
I haven't felt like any DMC brain rot so much.

5824
06:26:14,050 --> 06:26:14,730
Except...

5825
06:26:15,330 --> 06:26:19,170
I do quote the...

5826
06:26:19,170 --> 06:26:19,550
LIE!

5827
06:26:20,350 --> 06:26:21,350
thing quite often.

5828
06:26:23,650 --> 06:26:26,850
I was supposed to seal your soul with a lie!

5829
06:26:29,350 --> 06:26:30,350
So yeah.

5830
06:26:31,490 --> 06:26:32,610
We'll start...

5831
06:26:32,610 --> 06:26:34,450
How long is DMC 3?

5832
06:26:35,490 --> 06:26:36,070
Oh, sorry.

5833
06:26:36,210 --> 06:26:36,610
Hold on.

5834
06:26:37,310 --> 06:26:37,930
I think...

5835
06:26:37,930 --> 06:26:42,050
How long to beat Devil May Cry 3?

5836
06:26:43,750 --> 06:26:44,610
Oh, okay.

5837
06:26:44,710 --> 06:26:46,390
So, like, a couple streams.

5838
06:26:46,550 --> 06:26:47,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5839
06:26:47,270 --> 06:26:47,890
That's no problem.

5840
06:26:50,190 --> 06:26:51,610
Yeah, that's no problem.

5841
06:26:54,630 --> 06:26:55,450
Oh, good.

5842
06:26:55,710 --> 06:26:56,410
20 missions.

5843
06:26:56,610 --> 06:26:56,810
Okay.

5844
06:26:57,390 --> 06:26:57,670
Cool.

5845
06:26:58,450 --> 06:26:59,670
Yeah, I'm thinking...

5846
06:27:01,010 --> 06:27:03,670
Depending on how far I get...

5847
06:27:05,110 --> 06:27:05,550
Like...

5848
06:27:05,550 --> 06:27:06,310
3 streams.

5849
06:27:09,790 --> 06:27:10,890
Sometimes it depends.

5850
06:27:11,090 --> 06:27:13,810
I'll be expecting to do 3 streams with a stream.

5851
06:27:14,150 --> 06:27:14,750
Or with a game.

5852
06:27:15,290 --> 06:27:16,390
And then I'm like...

5853
06:27:16,390 --> 06:27:17,630
I'm so tired.

5854
06:27:17,690 --> 06:27:19,090
I can only go on for so long.

5855
06:27:24,270 --> 06:27:24,710
Okay.

5856
06:27:24,710 --> 06:27:26,250
Otsumito, everybody!

5857
06:27:26,970 --> 06:27:27,590
Thank you.

5858
06:27:27,650 --> 06:27:28,330
We finally...

5859
06:27:28,330 --> 06:27:28,970
We beat this.

5860
06:27:29,910 --> 06:27:32,090
We can cross it off the books.

5861
06:27:33,350 --> 06:27:34,010
Otsumito!

5862
06:27:34,310 --> 06:27:34,810
Otsumito!

5863
06:27:34,970 --> 06:27:35,330
Otsumito!

5864
06:27:35,510 --> 06:27:36,490
Thank you, guys.

5865
06:27:36,570 --> 06:27:38,750
I will see you...

5866
06:27:38,750 --> 06:27:40,050
Whenever...

5867
06:27:40,050 --> 06:27:41,250
Tomorrow I'm playing Metal Gear.

5868
06:27:43,850 --> 06:27:45,810
I was gonna say...

5869
06:27:45,810 --> 06:27:47,330
Supreme Game Series.

5870
06:27:48,170 --> 06:27:51,790
That might wrestle some jimmies, I think.

5871
06:27:51,790 --> 06:27:54,210
Thanks for the superchat!

5872
06:27:56,130 --> 06:27:57,910
But it will be ghost babble.

5873
06:27:58,250 --> 06:27:59,210
So I'm very, very excited.

5874
06:27:59,310 --> 06:28:01,150
One that I have not played yet.

5875
06:28:02,430 --> 06:28:03,550
So, exciting.

5876
06:28:04,110 --> 06:28:04,990
Otsumito, everybody!

5877
06:28:05,170 --> 06:28:07,530
Have a good night, have a good day.

5878
06:28:07,630 --> 06:28:09,790
And I'll see you guys next time.

5879
06:28:11,170 --> 06:28:12,070
Bye bye!

5880
06:28:38,540 --> 06:28:38,980
Oh!

5881
06:28:39,000 --> 06:28:39,800
Stool of Chains!

5882
06:28:39,900 --> 06:28:40,460
Oh my god!

5883
06:28:43,020 --> 06:28:44,460
Look at him!

5884
06:28:44,460 --> 06:28:45,040
Wow!

5885
06:28:47,760 --> 06:28:49,000
Oh my gosh!

5886
06:28:49,640 --> 06:28:50,940
Yeah, baby!

5887
06:28:51,560 --> 06:28:54,100
Is that an ass guy?

5888
06:28:54,220 --> 06:28:54,960
Or is that like a...

5889
06:28:54,960 --> 06:28:57,600
Why is he so...

5890
06:28:58,380 --> 06:28:58,720
Like...

5891
06:28:58,720 --> 06:29:01,260
Like he's so...

5892
06:29:02,420 --> 06:29:03,420
OK, bye!
