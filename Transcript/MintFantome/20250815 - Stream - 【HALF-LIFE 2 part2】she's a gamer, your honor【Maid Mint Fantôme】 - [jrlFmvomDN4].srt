1
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,560
Minky here.

2
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,420
Hello,

3
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:48,760
everybody.

4
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,980
Welcome, welcome, welcome in.

5
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,440
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

6
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:53,880
Hello.

7
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,000
Hi.

8
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,180
Oh, I opened up the first game.

9
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,440
Oh, my gosh.

10
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,120
Hold on.

11
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,060
I was about to say, you guys, I'm so tired.

12
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,900
the first game.

13
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,260
Sorry.

14
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm so tired today.

15
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,960
I didn't even...

16
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,540
I was like, this looks a little different.

17
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,820
Oh my gosh.

18
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,400
The opening, the screen changes depending on where you are at in the game.

19
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,300
That's so cute.

20
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:38,980
Hold on.

21
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,800
Oh my gosh.

22
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,440
I'm really tired today.

23
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,800
I can't believe I did that.

24
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,340
Hi, everybody!

25
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,440
Welcome back to Half-Life 2!

26
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,200
Not Half-Life 1.

27
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,260
2!

28
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,080
Golly.

29
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,260
Oh, we were there!

30
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,960
We were right there.

31
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,740
I went there.

32
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,580
And then we did the epic boat adventure.

33
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,020
And I killed it.

34
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,400
I gamed all the way through!

35
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,520
The only thing they fear is Mickey Ripperter.

36
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,740
Yeah!

37
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Are you the real Mint Phantom during this time of day in this region?

38
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,860
Localized entirely in this stream?

39
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,400
Yes.

40
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,460
May I watch it?

41
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:34,920
No.

42
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,480
Congrats on 400k.

43
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,660
Thank you!

44
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,240
I didn't actually get to properly say anything.

45
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,880
Thank you guys so much for 400k!

46
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,800
We did it.

47
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,080
We did it.

48
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,380
Guys, I'm going to do my best today.

49
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,240
I hope I wake up a little bit.

50
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,520
I hope I wake up a little

51
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:03,980
bit.

52
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,700
Slept extra.

53
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,720
I said good.

54
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,100
You guys, I have a confession.

55
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,200
I said good morning, Minto on Twitter.

56
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,580
I got up, out of bed, posted that, and went back to sleep.

57
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,480
It was not morning for me.

58
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,960
I usually never post until I'm like, okay, I'm going to stay awake.

59
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,540
But that one...

60
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,320
I will.

61
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,040
I will have my privacy.

62
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,800
She's probably like, why?

63
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,260
She's so sleepy.

64
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,420
Did you sleep well, okay, Minky?

65
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,680
I slept too good.

66
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,500
Yesterday, yesterday, during the collab with Nimi and...

67
00:07:51,520 --> 00:08:22,420
when we were playing Resident Evil I had a horrible midstream I had a horrible allergy attack I was like oh god it was so bad my nose was just going crazy and so after stream I took allergy medicine and that stuff knocks me the heck out and so I'm still feeling it I'm still feeling it look up five times for my alarm.

68
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,040
Still asleep at noon.

69
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,260
I never do that though for me.

70
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,500
Bill, thank you so much for the thank you to thank you.

71
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:34,100
It's my first night in Japan for my second trip here ever.

72
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,680
Facing fierce 3am battle with the jet hag.

73
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,120
Oh no, Todd.

74
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,580
I heard a steamed hams reference.

75
00:08:45,220 --> 00:10:16,100
Yeah, that first, this is my trick for Japan is I try to arrive as soon as pot like okay so obviously on the plane if it's night in japan i sleep on the plane if it's day in japan i do my dangness to stay awake and then once i'm there i try to fly in as early as possible like 1 p.m 2 p.m ish maybe sometimes earlier if there's a fly and then and then i just i just sit i i i do whatever it takes to stay awake i'll walk i'll walk for as to just to stay out of my hotel room so i do not i'm not tempted by the sweet sweet seductress that is my bed so good luck were you up late last night playing gotcha oh no that was me get your sleep everybody get your sleep yeah but i've been there so many times at this point that it's like usually jet lag it depends on the trip maybe sometimes it hits me bad sometimes I'm pretty good new outfit and comic kit 106 this is going to be a packed weekend yeah my mama has comic kit merch everybody of me and other things if you are into the variety of thin books

76
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,920
that are of a certain devious nature.

77
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,460
My mama, oh my gosh, Ayami Mama's books, they're full color, they're so beautiful.

78
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,860
I recommend very, very, I mean, that's what made me a fan of hers to begin with, so.

79
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,720
Mint Dojin?

80
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,760
I would say 1 million, but I don't know if I'll ever get there.

81
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,660
So maybe 500k.

82
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:55,120
I'll ask Ayami Mama for a for official Minto Dojin.

83
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,460
Maybe I should aim high though.

84
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,620
That's pretty special.

85
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,960
That's pretty special.

86
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,600
So maybe...

87
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,060
Maybe we should aim big.

88
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,380
We're 100k though.

89
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,700
That's a long time from now.

90
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:19,260
Probably.

91
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,160
So...

92
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,580
Curious, have you ever spoken to any of your model sisters?

93
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,160
I've met Sleepy at the off-kai.

94
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,140
We hung out a little bit, actually.

95
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,980
For JP, though?

96
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
Not really.

97
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,200
I've been thinking.

98
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,780
I'm still not used to having thoughts, but I'm trying my best.

99
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,260
Make it 690K.

100
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,480
That's so goofy.

101
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,300
She's a gay Mercedes, so...

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:10,300

Let me drink some more coffee.

108
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,800
I have to sing, sing, Hips Don't Lie.

109
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:01,400

Oh my gosh, ghost of it!

114
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,200
I had the pleasure of meeting my fellow wisps at Otaku-tan last weekend.

115
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,300
Forget busting minto with glasses makes me feel good.

116
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,720
I'm glad you had fun at Otaku-tan!

117
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:08,400
My friend asked if I wanted to go to Otaku-tan next year, so I will try to be there next year too, make it this year.

118
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,100
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,440
A $50 fine.

120
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,580
Oh, no.

121
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,740
You fine.

122
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,160
So can you have a girlfriend?

123
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,880
Stop.

124
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,660
Now go tell her double.

125
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,520
Go tell her double.

126
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,800
You stole his girlfriend already?

127
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,600
Tee-hee.

128
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,140
All right, shall we get into it?

129
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,720
This is, I'm really enjoying this like swamp ASMR though.

130
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,120
Let's turn up a little bit.

131
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,760
We have a girlfriend, Vinky.

132
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,820
Hello, Ichiba and Minky.

133
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,920
I've been spending too much on Gacha lately, so I'm cleansing the bad energy by donating to a worthy cause.

134
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,660
Not the Gacha, no.

135
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:18,960
No.

136
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,040
Just got out of work and here's a cute Minky on my screen.

137
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,300
What should I give for lunch?

138
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,980
Open to haunt-based meal sharing options?

139
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,100
Friday lunch should be very special.

140
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,460
There's like a, there's a place by me that makes a sick fried rice.

141
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,320
I think I'm gonna get that today.

142
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,120
My diet!

143
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,860
I'll just pretend.

144
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,460
I'll just imagine the taste of the fried rice right now.

145
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:56,800
Oh.

146
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,480
Mmm, egg.

147
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:00,740
Oh.

148
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,180
Mmm.

149
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,300
So yummy.

150
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,600
I'm full.

151
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:36,960
are you more of an inner voice thinker where you think in words and voice everything out in your head or a visual thinker i think i'm an inner voice thinker actually i'm an outer voice thinker i say everything i'm one of those that's that i'll be by myself and i'll be like oh i need to go do that I think.

152
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I have an outer voice that I say everything that's like.

153
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,660
Did you talk to yourself?

154
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:46,860
Maybe.

155
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:55,050
I can't stop talking all the time.

156
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:56,910
I have a problem.

157
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,670
Maybe that's why I can yap so much on stream.

158
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,830
I'm currently sick, but I think a minke stream is a good way to feel better, by the way.

159
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:06,570
Congrats on Farakay.

160
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,270
Thank you!

161
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,190
Thank you so much!

162
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,730
Thank you, thank you.

163
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,850
I'm tired of what a leave work early.

164
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:14,290
No!

165
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:15,790
I mean, you could.

166
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:16,530
It's Friday.

167
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,550
Inner mouse, singer.

168
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,870
What does that mean?

169
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,070
I even enjoyed Half-Life 1.

170
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,210
You might check out Black Mesa.

171
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,110
Oh, yeah, yeah.

172
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,230
And thank you for congrats.

173
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:27,870
Thank you.

174
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,030
Lucky thanks for the five gifted to Agu.

175
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:34,130
Nah, I just yop about everything.

176
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,750
Talks to himself.

177
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,650
Keeps showing up.

178
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,690
my employment reviews.

179
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,150
I...

180
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:53,550
I guess, but I do in my head think of conversations and I'll be like

181
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,550
Good thinking me.

182
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,690
Good thinking, Boku.

183
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,010
Okay!

184
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,370
Someone's a xenomorph around here.

185
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,590
Oh my gosh, I saw a clip of that Alien Earth show.

186
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,470
I haven't watched it.

187
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,710
Did you guys know that there's Alien Earth?

188
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,530
It's a new Alien TV show.

189
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,190
And I guess the girl likes Ice Age.

190
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:38,670
And so sometimes I saw a clip of Ice Age Sid just appearing in the show.

191
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,730
I don't get it.

192
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,540
History Channel?

193
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,880
No, no, you know, Alien, like the movie, the horror movie.

194
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,220
And then they had the Alien Romulus.

195
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,660
And now there's Alien Earth.

196
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,120
The clip with Sid!

197
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,360
Disney owns Alien and Ice Age.

198
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,420
Wait, Disney does not own Ice Age?

199
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:10,780
No?

200
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,240
I thought Ice Age was DreamWorks.

201
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,320
Oh gosh, they're all owned by like the same five billionaires anywhere, no?

202
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,480
I don't know anymore.

203
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
But I thought Ice Age was DreamWorks.

204
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,000
There's a new alien show.

205
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Wait, is that the same thing?

206
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
Are you going to try the new McDonald's shake?

207
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,580
Isn't that... Isn't people...

208
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,760
People are like acting like it's the new Grimmest Shake.

209
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,700
They're pouring it all over themselves.

210
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,660
Good morning, Miss Minto Freeman.

211
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,140
Rise and shine.

212
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,960
Thank you, Kamendachi.

213
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,280
Good morning.

214
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,440
When do we get alien isolation stream?

215
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,040
It's so scary, though.

216
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,020
It's so scary.

217
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,680
Ice Age was distributed by 20th Century Fox, who Disney owns now.

218
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,400
Oh, I see, I see.

219
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,220
I see, I see.

220
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,260
Okay.

221
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,500
Gosh, Disney owns...

222
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,300
my pinky toe too.

223
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,300
I saw the clip today.

224
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,060
I swore a pic was a joker for...

225
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,020
Yeah, me too.

226
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,920
I saw it today.

227
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,880
I was like, huh?

228
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,420
Huh?

229
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,640
It's time for tomorrow too.

230
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,460
Thank you.

231
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,780
Thank you, thank you.

232
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,780
But, um...

233
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,800
Uh...

234
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
I don't remember where I was going with this.

235
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,880
Oh, I do remember though.

236
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,800
were talking about Disney and Alien.

237
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,360
Um, do you guys remember the Alien ride that used to be at Disney?

238
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,920
Do you guys remember?

239
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,360
And then it changed to Stitch Ride.

240
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,160
I like to watch videos of it.

241
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,620
I got to ride it.

242
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,060
I got to, well I say ride it.

243
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:35,120
It's really, okay, so basically I remember this so much because I got to ride it once as a kid alien encounter yeah yeah yeah i got to watch i got to i say watch it's not really a ride you just kind of sit there it's really it's really an experience i got to experience it once as a wee wisp and so basically i remember it so well and also i watch a lot of videos because of theme parks But anyway,

244
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:45,500
you go into this room and they're like, they are, they're, they, uh, I'm getting excited.

245
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,620
They're like, we have this new technology to teleport critters.

246
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
Let us teleport this critter to show you.

247
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,960
And they teleport this little guy.

248
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,680
And when he teleports into the other, into the other tube, he's all freaky and gross.

249
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:30,340
and they're like oh it's probably fine just go into the so that's like the pre-show right go that's the pre-show and then you go into the main room and it's a big like 360 room like then there's a tube in the middle and you sit in a chair and they're like okay now we're going to teleport the creature to you and you will see the creature and it's xenomorph it's so

250
00:23:34,680 --> 00:24:05,720
from me okay and then things start getting crazy and the lights shut off and you start hearing like xenomorphs footsteps running around the room and you like you first hear the crash because she escapes from the pod and then you feel her breathing on your neck and and and then she spits on you oh my gosh i'm getting why'd they take it away from me from us oh my gosh Oh,

251
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,700
if only I had a time machine, it could go back in time and experience it again.

252
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:18,590
And then they changed it to Stitch, Lilo and Stitch.

253
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:22,010
So it was much more like kid-friendly because I'm in.

254
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,570
That ride traumatized me.

255
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,970
I loved it.

256
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,770
I, oh my gosh.

257
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,610
I probably talked about that ride a couple times a month for...

258
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,950
for even until now.

259
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:44,500
Oh my gosh.

260
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,780
And now, now it's like now there's, I think the setup for the ride is still there.

261
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,280
The experience is still there, but I don't think that they've done anything with it.

262
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,780
Oh, oh my gosh.

263
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:02,080
To me, Xenomorph to see her right in front.

264
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,960
Oh gosh.

265
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:04,820
Wow.

266
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,460
I recommend looking up a video, but it's really just like darkness.

267
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,000
most of the time.

268
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,900
It's just dark.

269
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,540
It was something that you can't really watch.

270
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
You have to only experience it.

271
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,260
It's how when they got rid of Muppet Vision.

272
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:22,120
Yeah.

273
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,680
The last thing Jim Henson worked on.

274
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,060
Yeah.

275
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:25,980
So sad.

276
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,720
Rainbow Connection.

277
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:34,980
Favorite part is that when the worker comes in from the ceiling and looks down at the audience, then gets crouched.

278
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,850
Ride it, please!

279
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,070
So good.

280
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:48,810
Sorry.

281
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:52,170
I go bonkers over this thing.

282
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,930
Why did they get rid of it?

283
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,250
Okay.

284
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:57,630
Okay.

285
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:58,550
I'm good.

286
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:59,210
I'm chill.

287
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,850
I'm fine.

288
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,770
I'm okay.

289
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:03,630
Man.

290
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,180
Let's play game.

291
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,900
Maybe the coffee's hitting.

292
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,120
Okay.

293
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,740
So I had just solved this puzzle.

294
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,800
Because I'm so smart.

295
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,060
Oh no, I have to do the boat again.

296
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,360
Oh no.

297
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,380
Oh no, I have to do the boat again.

298
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:31,980
Okay.

299
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,050
Okay.

300
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,190
Let me turn it down a little bit.

301
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,630
Swamp goes.

302
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,670
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

303
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,010
Now that they actually own alien, it would be cool if they brought it back.

304
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,870
But with the actual alien IP instead of the original.

305
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:52,970
bug monster.

306
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,230
I want it.

307
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,970
I want it.

308
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:57,350
I want.

309
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,630
I want.

310
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,490
I want.

311
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:09,730
Speaking about half-lives, Plutonium-238 has a half-life of about 68.9 years.

312
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,810
Nice.

313
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,170
About as old as Minto.

314
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:14,390
Hey!

315
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,370
Yeah, I did solve it.

316
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,740
Here we go.

317
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,900
Oh.

318
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,380
What movie, please?

319
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,160
Never knew you loved aliens so much.

320
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,020
Yes!

321
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,900
Oh my gosh.

322
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,360
It's actually like...

323
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:42,160
I watch it all the time on the plane.

324
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,420
I think it's like one of the...

325
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,040
It's a perfect movie, honestly.

326
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,140
It's one of my favorite movies.

327
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,620
Here we go!

328
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:48,880
Oh.

329
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:50,700
Please.

330
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,760
Here we go.

331
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,000
Ah, ah, guys, guys, I think I'm in trouble.

332
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,020
Okay, okay, okay.

333
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,820
I have to remember the controls.

334
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,600
Here we go.

335
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,260
It's gotta be through here.

336
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:24,800
Never mind.

337
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,400
It's not.

338
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,380
Okay, why would they have this here then?

339
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,480
If we're not this being the way.

340
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,680

344
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,280
It's so cool to see him just down.

345
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,220
Wow, he looks at me with such disgust.

346
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:32,780
Whoa.

347
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,600
Okay, hold on.

348
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm looking around first.

349
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,240
Let me look around a little bit.

350
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,880
Let me appreciate your abode.

351
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,100
Oh.

352
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:50,710
Okay.

353
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,050
Thank you.

354
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,210
He likes me.

355
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,150
Oh, he's shy.

356
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,050
He's shy.

357
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,070
Can't make eye contact with me.

358
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,510
Oh, with a big, big eye.

359
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:02,970
Wow.

360
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,270
Wait, he's actually so cute.

361
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,410
Ah!

362
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,970
He's so shy.

363
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,390
Why he kind of.

364
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,590
That's what I'm saying.

365
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,310
Wait, he's actually so cute.

366
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,530
What is the booty shot looking like anyway?

367
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,970
Not much going on in the back.

368
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:25,950
But he's got the big hump to make up for it.

369
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,130
Yeah, don't worry about it, buddy.

370
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,530
Okay, I'll come, I'll come.

371
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,110
I'll stop beating everything up now.

372
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,310
Hello.

373
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,750
Hello?

374
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,890

377
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,590
It's just up ahead.

378
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,890

We gotta break camp.

384

Okay.

385
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,690
Farewell, citizens.

386
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,510
For freedom!

387
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,330
For freedom!

388
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,570
Thank you, ma'am.

389
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:37,550
Oh.

390
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,810
I'm taking these with me.

391
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:41,810
Oh.

392
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,430
They look...

393
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:43,730
Okay.

394
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,790
I guess I shouldn't waste my...

395
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,630
My ammo.

396
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,010
Oh wait, I have infinite ammo!

397
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,260
I guess I could have used the crates on.

398
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,140
That's so funny.

399
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:04,860
Oh well.

400
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,860
The music is so loud.

401
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,100
This way?

402
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:39,050
Ow!

403
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:39,470
Shoot!

404
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,780
I got- I know where I need to go, but...

405
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,180
Ah shoot!

406
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,480
Ah!

407
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,080
I'm stuck!

408
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,640
Please!

409
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,580
Oh please.

410
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,820
I need to remember how to pilot this thing.

411
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:16,100
Oh gosh I don't know how to file it I was doing fine until I was not Hold on Take it down anybody in my way Okay, we're fine Everything's good

412
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:29,060
I Um I don't know what just happened but We're fine Everything's good Everything's chill.

413
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,600
We were fine.

414
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,260
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

415
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,000
Ouch!

416
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,480
Everything's chill.

417
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,680
Everything's fine.

418
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:55,920
Everything's cool.

419
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:01,940
Everything's fine.

420
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:02,700
Everything's chill.

421
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:03,960
Everything's chill.

422
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,800
Everything's chill.

423
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,500
Everything's chill.

424
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:10,760
Yeah.

425
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,900
If I just keep saying that, I know what's real, I know what's the truth.

426
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,380
Keep saying, everything's fine, everything's chill.

427
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:22,680
It's the truth.

428
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,020
Just keep going forward, baby.

429
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Don't look back.

430
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,260
That's the motto.

431
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,180
That's the motto.

432
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,980
Don't look back.

433
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,010
This way!

434
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,910
Oh, that's awkward.

435
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,690
Okay, I see what I have to do.

436
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:04,730
Ouch.

437
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,190
Turn around.

438
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,870
We made it.

439
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,010
Easy peasy.

440
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:18,670
Wait.

441
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:20,590
Those good guys?

442
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,270
No, those were head crab guys.

443
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,370
I think.

444
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,320
Ouch.

445
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,140
Oh, we're fine.

446
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,720
Oh.

447
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,640
Oh, shoot.

448
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,680
I missed my...

449
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,120
I think.

450
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,280
Actually, I don't know where I'm supposed to be.

451
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,980
No, we're fine.

452
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,840
I thought I was supposed to go up, but I think I'm supposed to go this way.

453
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,860
My health is not so great.

454
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,360
6 HP in a dream.

455
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,640
But it's nice and calm now.

456
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,240
Oh.

457
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,520
Where's it?

458
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,160
Drop me off at... Oh, right here!

459
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,720
This is...

460
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
Oh, but I have the 6 HP.

461
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,000
Will I be okay?

462
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,260
Will I be okay here?

463
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,440
How...

464
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,100
No!

465
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,620
There has to be health around somewhere, no?

466
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,050
Maybe...

467
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,650
I don't know when they'll get me.

468
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,310
And they'll start firing at me.

469
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:06,450
Oh,

470
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,690
here we go.

471
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,470
Aha!

472
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,710
Yeah, baby.

473
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,070
This should be better though.

474
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,980
Five HP more than you need to beat the game.

475
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,110
Six HP.

476
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,170
Enough to survive anything that shoots at me.

477
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:50,570
Okay.

478
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,350
Now, do I...

479
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,590
So I need to get in there?

480
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,950
I need to do the craziest jumps of all time, apparently.

481
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:03,490
Is that a ramp that I go up...

482
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,450
The ramp doesn't look high enough, though.

483
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,800
I once had to start a new game from this chapter because I was auto-saved with 15 HP before a ton of bullets and kind of soft-logged.

484
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,260
No!

485
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,820
Please don't stop.

486
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:32,380
Bam, if I need to save you guys, you guys, because you saw that when I died, it spawned me right there.

487
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,100
So, you know, I just did the auto-save, but it's okay.

488
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,980
I wasn't very far anyway from right this point.

489
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,500
Save us from how cute you are.

490
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,820
Oh, I see that guy.

491
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,000
Is he gonna see me?

492
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,900
You think I can get him from here?

493
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,460
Is that coming towards me?

494
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,940
Oh my god!

495
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,340
How did it do that?

496
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:30,020
Ouch.

497
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,300
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

498
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,420
How are they going crazy like that, though?

499
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,660
That guy, like, completely avoided the ship.

500
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:50,980
Okay.

501
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,000
Fireworks, baby.

502
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,780
Okay, we sniped one guy, so that's one down.

503
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,860
That's one down.

504
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,980
save just yet because, you know, I did get hit.

505
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,620
Not the honing missiles.

506
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,300
But there is a guy right here.

507
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,680
I'm like super taking it slow here.

508
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:17,580
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my gosh.

509
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't even know how he's seeing me.

510
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,900
Maybe okay, hold on.

511
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:33,870
There we go.

512
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:39,160
There are two boats!

513
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,480
Okay.

514
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,620
Okay.

515
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,840
But I don't know where he is.

516
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,010
Oh my gosh.

517
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:03,390
Ouch!

518
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:03,690
Ouch!

519
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:03,950
Ouch!

520
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,770
Oh, there he is.

521
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,770
Run!

522
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,930
Tactical retreat!

523
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,010
Tactical retreat!

524
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,850
Oh my gosh, Tofu, thank you so much for the peek!

525
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,010
No!

526
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:21,730
Tofu, son!

527
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,050
Retreat, retreat!

528
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,270
Is it here?

529
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,990
Oh, I can't even reach that far.

530
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,530
Okay, that's why it was turning red.

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,080
Okay, now we can do this part in peace.

541
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,900
I can figure it out.

542
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,060
Yippee!

543
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,880
How do I do this?

544
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,180
Do I get out of here?

545
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,080
And jump up there?

546
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,860
What?

547
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:40,580
There is...

548
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:42,500
I had a feeling there would be...

549
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,780
Ha ha ha ha!

550
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:49,570
Okay.

551
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,310
Is this actually a puzzle?

552
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,610
Looking around for more supplies.

553
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:10,430
Yeah, no help right now.

554
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,470
Let me figure it out.

555
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:12,570
Let me figure it out.

556
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,270
If I can.

557
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:16,470
My brain is so slow today.

558
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:18,870
Oh, okay.

559
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:22,210
Too thick for that little area.

560
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:29,830
Oh!

561
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,230
I understand.

562
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,470
Oh, that's gotta be tricky.

563
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,740
It's common to get stuck here.

564
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,020
Wait, so can I not get up there at all?

565
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,240
Up top?

566
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,180
I thought I was going to have to be like...

567
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:58,020
Mimki doesn't need to hear all this.

568
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,440
She's a highly trained professional.

569
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:01,140
So true.

570
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,780
How do I get in there?

571
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:10,800
What?

572
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,600
Wait, oh, how do I get in there?

573
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,620
Oh, wait.

574
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,380
I just noticed it's closed off.

575
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,600
Ah.

576
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,120
Ha.

577
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,940
I'm making entrance.

578
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:49,540
Let's see.

579
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,060
We're swimming, we're swimming.

580
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,240
Yeah, I need to hit it a bajillion more times.

581
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,520
We'll get it.

582
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,400
We'll get it.

583
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,080
I'm on the boat.

584
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,220
I'm on a boat.

585
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,140
Wait, can I jump up here?

586
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,800
I don't know if I can make that or not.

587
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,110
Oh wait, crouch jump maybe?

588
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,280
Okay.

589
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:09,300
I see it!

590
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,800
I see the salvation!

591
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,700
I'm exploring, I'm looking...

592
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:38,740
Early stream!

593
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,740
Thanks Minto, of course!

594
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:42,880
Thanks for watching!

595
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,580
I feel like it has to be here.

596
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,840
Oh wait, oh...

597
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:16,810
Nice.

598
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:24,210
How did I miss that?

599
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,630
Because I was looking at the container earlier to see if there was anything in it.

600
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,010
How did I miss that?

601
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:31,790
Oh, what?

602
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,040
Okay, back it up.

603
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:40,760
Back it up.

604
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,080
You looked at the other one.

605
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,160
Yeah, but I looked at that one, too.

606
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,440
I think I only looked at the front.

607
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:47,640
Woo!

608
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,100
Woo!

609
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:49,720
Woo!

610
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,420
Oh, we made

611
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,040
it!

612
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,340
We're fine.

613
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,040
For a degree.

614
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,480
Don't say Sasuga.

615
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,200
Don't say Sasuga!

616
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,140
Haha!

617
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,040
Easy!

618
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:29,220
This way.

619
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,060
This way.

620
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:44,030
More boating?

621
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,790
Will I ever get off this damn ride?

622
00:49:53,480 --> 00:50:01,800
This area is so explore, Congrats on your Leon campaign.

623
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,580
Thank you.

624
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,680
Is that boss?

625
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:13,100
Uh-oh.

626
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,280
Are we bossing now?

627
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:16,880
Nice.

628
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,520
I remember this section being very long.

629
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:25,640
Oh, man.

630
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:34,000
Oh, we got little bit more suit juice I guess is

631
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:45,000
this part really hard I'm trying to I'm keeping an eye out oh yeah I see containers

632
00:50:51,600 --> 00:51:08,220
more suit juice more suit juice nice what's this is that a grenade?

633
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,560
I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild, right?

634
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,340
That's exactly what I was thinking.

635
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:20,100
Hello, please.

636
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:21,780
I can't even...

637
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:22,800
I'm too used to the boat.

638
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,280
I can't even do a simple jump anymore.

639
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,000
Okay, we're almost 100, 100, so...

640
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,140
Maybe we'll be okay.

641
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,240
The game at least prepared us in that regard.

642
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,700
Let me check the other side.

643
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,820
Oh, I see more crates.

644
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:01,080
Suit juice?

645
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:02,760
Ahay!

646
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:03,620
Nice.

647
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,300
I'm not stalling, I'm preparing!

648
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,260
This is completely different.

649
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,520
And now we're at 100, baby.

650
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:16,980
Okay.

651
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,200
That's all I can do.

652
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,360
And now save in...

653
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,220
Iki match!

654
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,080
Oh,

655
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,480
there's barrels, okay.

656
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,260
We gotta blow something up.

657
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,780
Or he's gonna try and blow me up.

658
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:05,980
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

659
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:13,750
Him?

660
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:14,790
Wait, I'm stuck.

661
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,560
I don't even know it.

662
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,540
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

663
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:30,830
Oh my gosh, how is he not blowing these up, though?

664
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,790
You know?

665
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,830
All of these...

666
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,790
We're out of soldiers!

667
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:04,990
I need to get out of here, I need to get out of here, I need to get out of here, I need to get out of here!

668
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:10,090
I don't think

669
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:20,130
I did at all a single bit.

670
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,970
Oh my gosh.

671
00:55:26,350 --> 00:55:27,050
Where is he?

672
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:27,530
Oh there.

673
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:58,750
I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, no please, I think I just saw a crate, maybe I should have saved some crate, oh, 2 HP in a dream, ah ha ha ha, holy moly, this guy is tanky, what the heck, I

674
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:14,360
was close, dang, that guy was tanky, I was tanky, I was tanky, as heck.

675
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,500
So stinking tanky.

676
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:20,660
Okay.

677
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,060
Let's go!

678
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,720
No, that's a helicopter.

679
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,300
If I get rid of these first, though...

680
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:45,390
Oh, yep.

681
00:56:46,570 --> 00:56:48,130
Ah, I was trying to leave.

682
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:51,410
Oh my gosh, I can't.

683
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:54,710
I can't drive this thing.

684
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:55,290
Oh, here we go.

685
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:55,730
Okay.

686
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:03,220
Like, if I blow these up first so that they... Oh, I see another one, too.

687
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,160
Oh, shoot!

688
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,900
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

689
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,340
Wait, did all these respawn?

690
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,520
Is it so?

691
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:28,160
Awesome?

692
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:28,920
Ow!

693
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:29,900
Oh, we're fine.

694
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:30,520
Everything's good.

695
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,600
Oh, we're not good.

696
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,020
We're not good.

697
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:32,380
We're not good.

698
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,960
We're actually in the worst possible predicament.

699
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,960
Shoot him while he's close.

700
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,240
Blow these up so that they don't blow me up instead.

701
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:58,690
Get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here!

702
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,930
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, so much is happening.

703
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:48,510
I don't even know if I'm hitting him or not.

704
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:55,590
Where is he?

705
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,850
Where is he?

706
00:58:59,310 --> 00:58:59,850
Behind me?

707
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:00,010
Oh.

708
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,810
I know it's kind of dumb to just sit still and let it happen, but...

709
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:13,830
Um...

710
00:59:13,830 --> 00:59:14,510
Oh my god!

711
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:16,410
Please.

712
00:59:18,290 --> 00:59:19,090
Spare me.

713
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:19,770
Oh my god.

714
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:44,150
What is he gonna start doing the...

715
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:45,310
dropping the bombs again?

716
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:45,870
Oh.

717
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,140
Please, uh...

718
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,020
Spare me!

719
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,520
Oh my god.

720
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,680
I'm in the worst possible place.

721
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:40,340
Maybe?

722
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,820
Wait, where is he, actually?

723
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:43,320
Oh.

724
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:45,180
Is he behind me?

725
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:45,300
Where?

726
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:49,040
He's right behind me, isn't he?

727
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:49,440
Ah!

728
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,460
Stop.

729
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:58,680
And I'm out of hell.

730
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,300
We did it!

731
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,380
Oh my god!

732
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,000
How did we do it?

733
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:21,120
Yippee!

734
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,040
I think there was health over here.

735
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,980
Or wait, I'll find it.

736
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,580
Wait, where was it?

737
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:29,980
No!

738
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,700
It's on the log.

739
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,020
Yeah, it's like somewhere over here.

740
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,100
I'm just gonna get off this wild ride.

741
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:41,040
Get me off of here.

742
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:41,340
Okay.

743
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:42,680
There it is.

744
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,340
Okay, thank you so much, bro.

745
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,120
Bye.

746
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:50,520
Oh, wait.

747
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,580
There was more underneath.

748
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,900
the thing, too.

749
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,380
Because I was full.

750
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,660
That takes care of the cremation?

751
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:11,640
Nice.

752
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,660
First try, baby.

753
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,860
Gamers helps just drop their next V cards at any chance you have a creator card.

754
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,120
Um, not me.

755
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:30,560
They've been sending me a lot of stuff for it.

756
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,570
Thank you so much for the pig, thank you!

757
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,530
Yeah, it was a first try.

758
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,310
Don't get it twisted.

759
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:44,670
That was the first try.

760
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,330
That wasn't so bad, he was just tanky.

761
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:52,730
Honestly, it...

762
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:55,550
The game was quite generous for health and everything.

763
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:00,690
And I'm stupid, I just sit there and take it.

764
01:03:01,030 --> 01:03:03,010
I literally just tank it the whole time.

765
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:06,590
There's got to be some over here, too.

766
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:07,590
No?

767
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:08,710
No?

768
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:10,590
Okay, it's not bad, Generos.

769
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:14,670
Game, I was hyping you up.

770
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:18,870
Damn.

771
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:24,540
So what's this?

772
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:43,310
Wait, what?

773
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,790
Why are you guys responding to?

774
01:03:51,610 --> 01:03:53,210
Did Doki play this game?

775
01:03:55,850 --> 01:03:56,850
Left of the game.

776
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,740
Oh, I see it.

777
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:08,060
Thank you.

778
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:13,100
I didn't...

779
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,560
I don't...

780
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,000
Oh, she...

781
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:15,180
Oh.

782
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,060
Oh, gosh.

783
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:19,380
I hate the ladders in this game.

784
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,300
It's...

785
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:26,880
It's Elp, but I'm blind, so it's fine.

786
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:27,680
Oh my gosh.

787
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,740
It's cool how you can...

788
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,180
Oh, please.

789
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,100
How you can see...

790
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,100
Sorry, I'll redo it.

791
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,700
But over there, it's, like, electrified.

792
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,140
That's so cool.

793
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:39,360
All just the small little details.

794
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,400
Chopper's ball spamming is actually a bug.

795
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,040
But Valve liked it, so they kept it in.

796
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:48,160
Oh, what?

797
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,900
So they hate us.

798
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,380
That's what you're saying.

799
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,860
I see a little ladder.

800
01:05:12,020 --> 01:05:12,380
Oh, wait.

801
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:14,500
What's going on here?

802
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,160
What's going on?

803
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:16,160
Wait a second.

804
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:16,720
Wait a second.

805
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:18,680
There's a lot going on here.

806
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:26,050
What's going on up here?

807
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:27,750
One.

808
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:30,530
Oh no.

809
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:32,070
Oh,

810
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:37,820
they use a gun again.

811
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:41,280
Oh, I just wasted that.

812
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:42,520
That's really unfortunate.

813
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:53,830
Where did you guys come from?

814
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,390
I deflect your bullets.

815
01:05:58,330 --> 01:05:59,010
Uh.

816
01:05:59,390 --> 01:05:59,530
Uh.

817
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,170
Where are you?

818
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,320
Is it the guy from over here?

819
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:16,640
Wow, it's so beautiful here.

820
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:16,880
No?

821
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,460
Use the boat.

822
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,080
What a lovely sunset.

823
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:36,760
I feel like I have to go up here anyway, so might as well explore a little bit, huh?

824
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,540
Anyone else?

825
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,100
Okay.

826
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:08,960
Oh, whoa!

827
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:11,380
Hi!

828
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:12,200
Die!

829
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,620
Wait, oh gosh, I'm stuck.

830
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:14,380
Okay.

831
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,900
Oh, yeah, baby!

832
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,660
It was good we came in here.

833
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,120
Nice!

834
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:37,390
forgot how good the sound design in this game is it's nice right any buttons i could press i barely touched it

835
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:49,350
okay well we got some supplies that's always grand oh oh there's big stuff here

836
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:56,870
i think there's a ghost a ghost boost!

837
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:01,620
HP on the wall.

838
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:07,160
Thank you, I missed it.

839
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:11,600
I'm shoving my way through.

840
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:18,510
No, no.

841
01:08:18,570 --> 01:08:19,230
This place is haunted.

842
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,130
Let's get out of here.

843
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:23,310
This place is haunted!

844
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:30,450
Yeah, I noticed all of...

845
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,570
I see I...

846
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:32,050
Wait, did...

847
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:33,010
Is that a person walking?

848
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,700
I thought I saw a person patrolling over there.

849
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,040
I wish I had a sniper.

850
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:46,380
That was G-Man!

851
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,420
No way!

852
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:51,080
Oh my gosh!

853
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,320
He's still watching me?

854
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:58,600
What a little freakazoid that guy is.

855
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:03,060
If

856
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,390
I go over, there.

857
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:11,490
Yeah, whatever.

858
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,210
I think I can get back.

859
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:18,670
Observation.

860
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:23,690
Oh, this looks like a battle area if I've ever seen one.

861
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:28,750
They're like, oh yeah, plenty of places for you to duck and cover.

862
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,540
Yeah, that's what I saw from the other side.

863
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:42,820
Gee, man, boss fight.

864
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:43,240
Yeah.

865
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:45,480
This is not a ladder.

866
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:47,640
If I go down, will I be stuck?

867
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,160
Is it?

868
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,280
Well, maybe it is.

869
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,220
Oh, it is.

870
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:54,780
It's just like the thinnest ladder I've ever seen.

871
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,800
He's preparing for your unforeseen consequences.

872
01:10:09,690 --> 01:10:10,810
I think I need to go.

873
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:17,410
Is that like a limited time thing or...

874
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,740
This place is haunted.

875
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:46,570
for real I would know I would know it's just European European well

876
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:59,950
there's more bullets I guess then um we're good to go back down

877
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:09,980
Nothing.

878
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:13,120
Nothing, yeah.

879
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,920
Oh, what am I thinking?

880
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,700
We overwrote the gate on the other side.

881
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:33,660
Wait, there's an Easter egg here.

882
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,560
In the pipes?

883
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:50,230
Oh!

884
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,380
It's open.

885
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,480
I didn't think it was.

886
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,490
How do I get in there?

887
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:06,540
Maybe with that?

888
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:54,520

891

where to now and to what end discover the hidden sink Oh.

892
01:13:45,570 --> 01:13:46,870
We remember the free man.

893
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:48,710
We are coterminous.

894
01:13:50,270 --> 01:13:50,610
Hello.

895
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:54,670
There is no distance between us.

896
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:58,630
No false veils of time or space may intervene.

897
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,990
We see you still in black maize, sir.

898
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:05,550
Clearly we see you in the Nailin's chamber.

899
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:06,410
Chamber.

900
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,050
He is so cute.

901
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:09,290
Can I take your thing?

902
01:14:09,710 --> 01:14:11,110
A finest poet describes it thus.

903
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:11,650
Ah!

904
01:14:23,910 --> 01:14:26,590
I think I said something I shouldn't have.

905
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,350
Actually, yeah, I think it...

906
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:32,650
Is this your...

907
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:34,270
Oh, they're...

908
01:14:34,270 --> 01:14:35,190
Oh, sorry.

909
01:14:35,790 --> 01:14:36,870
I didn't mean to spill it.

910
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:42,910
Oh, he is chomping on them.

911
01:14:43,370 --> 01:14:43,950
Nice.

912
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,650
Um...

913
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:48,330
I think I had a...

914
01:14:48,530 --> 01:15:19,910
a piece of something you know when you make coffee sometimes and like sometimes the the little pieces get through at least for me I think I'm not good at making coffee this is more than anyone can bear but we will persevere persevere wait I got all this stuff but I still have to run back through the nastiness I still I still have to run back through this.

915
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:21,630
Yeah, the coffee.

916
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:24,930
Gap him harder.

917
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:30,110
We bear witness to the bright eternity of the Nailant's demise.

918
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,370
You leap, you fall, we see you flush between the barriers.

919
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:43,650
For a brief time you joined us, you are one between the worlds.

920
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:46,150
Yeah, I am, I am, I went there.

921
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,250
Communion of the Vortex.

922
01:15:48,530 --> 01:16:20,150
just reload that's true but I want to talk to it I got the achievement well the achievement will still stay that's true we cannot forget those whose cords you cut forgiveness is not ours to bestow he's so cute I want to live here with you sorry I didn't mean to make it all crazy unity of purpose the shattering of common shackles a single road we tread your song we sing and shall sing for eternity no matter the consequences of this struggle.

923
01:16:22,730 --> 01:16:26,310
You have brought us grief and jubilation beyond the measure.

924
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:28,030
The measure.

925
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:31,930
He sings in such a sing-songy way, or speaks.

926
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:35,970
We are there still in observance of your final stroke.

927
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:37,850
Stroke.

928
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:45,470
While our only scattered at your feet, you sieve at the voodoo cord that bound an ailment to life and to us.

929
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:46,270
To us.

930
01:16:47,030 --> 01:17:43,650
That sharp spur of hope has not dulled to this day for once the lesser master lay defeated we knew the greater must also fall in time with you besides us a talisman of victory the day of freedom draws nigh he should start a YouTube channel of scary ghost video compilations number 13 we have survived worse across the ages your bright face obscures your darker mask yeah this guy's yapping we call you sib although your mind and meaning are a mystery to us to us what's sib far distant eyes look out through yours something secret steers us both We shall not name it.

931
01:17:44,970 --> 01:17:47,170
We have endured these chafing bombs.

932
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:48,790
Do I need to keep talking to him?

933
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:49,650
Is something going to happen?

934
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:50,890
Can I leave?

935
01:17:52,370 --> 01:17:52,930
Intolerable.

936
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:54,610
Intolerable.

937
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:00,000
We are still here.

938
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,100
He sees us.

939
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,540
How do I...

940
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,640
I think it's F9.

941
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:06,420
Okay.

942
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:07,480
Yeah.

943
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,960
Well, that was cool.

944
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,020
Glad that I still saw him.

945
01:18:11,660 --> 01:18:13,560
Thank you for sharing the secret, everybody.

946
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:15,600
I like that.

947
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:20,400
He's just a yapper.

948
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,600
Wait, whoop.

949
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:30,880
Oh, there it is.

950
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,660
I see a ramp.

951
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,640
I go.

952
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:38,060
No, I don't.

953
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:38,720
Sorry.

954
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,620
She shoots.

955
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:43,600
She...

956
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:45,260
Uh...

957
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,220
Thank you for bringing Jubilation Beyond the Maja.

958
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,340
Okay, alright.

959
01:18:58,810 --> 01:18:59,210
Heyyoo!

960
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,090
Good enough!

961
01:19:02,430 --> 01:19:03,190
We made it!

962
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,020
Black Mesa East.

963
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:20,500
I see the symbol.

964
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,180
The symbol of my people.

965
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:31,060
Say goodbye to Bolt?

966
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:34,200
Is this it?

967
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:41,560
Is this where we Oh, boat.

968
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,200
Oh, boat.

969
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,080
Goodbye, boat.

970
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:48,960
One last donut.

971
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:49,900
Woo!

972
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:53,100
Okay.

973
01:19:53,980 --> 01:19:54,920
Maybe a little dizzy.

974
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,940
I'm guessing this is where I was supposed to go, but let me check the other side.

975
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:17,400
Wee-boo.

976
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:20,620
Sick moves.

977
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,120
Thank you.

978
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:41,650
Yep, I knew it.

979
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,880
Move, please.

980
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,910
Contaminated area.

981
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:57,380
Hello?

982
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,600
You've got something.

983
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:00,380
Hi!

984
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,540
Okay, it's human.

985
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:03,120
Yes.

986
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,340
Well, ghosts.

987
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:06,100
Former human.

988
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:09,080
You'll have to forgive the scanning process.

989
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,280
We can't take any chances.

990
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,040
Okay.

991
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:12,940
Dr. Freeman?

992
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:14,920
Gordon Freeman?

993
01:21:15,020 --> 01:21:15,560
That's me!

994
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:21,260
You've made it here this quickly, well Eli is going to be amazed, not to mention relieved.

995
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,120
I'm Dr. Mossman.

996
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,040
Yeah, I'm pretty fast.

997
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,420
I've been hearing about you since long before the Black Mesa incident.

998
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:30,700
I like how you can see her here too.

999
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,700
I do so envy you working with Eli and Dr. Clyde when they are at the top of their field.

1000
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:37,740
Ah, there we go.

1001
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:38,860
You can come through now.

1002
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:39,680
Thank you.

1003
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:48,020
You would never forgive me if I kept you waiting.

1004
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,100
I'm used to that.

1005
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:51,040
Hi.

1006
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,060
Good to know you.

1007
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:54,000
Thank you.

1008
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:55,080
Good to know you.

1009
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:56,960
You'd better get going.

1010
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,860
We can certainly use the extra help around here.

1011
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:03,380
We've covered a lot of ground in the last few months, but things would be so much faster for you.

1012
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,640
Poor people that you were trained.

1013
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,020
This way, Dr. Freeman.

1014
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:08,060
One moment.

1015
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,640
I must inspect your facilities.

1016
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:13,140
Okay.

1017
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:17,220
Free meets Moss.

1018
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:17,880
Moss?

1019
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,040
Moss Burger?

1020
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,880
We're closing in on a reliable local teleport technology.

1021
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,620
Something the Combine still hasn't mastered.

1022
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,420
Eli thinks their portals are string-based.

1023
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,380
Similar to our Kalabi Yama.

1024
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:30,820
Strand-based?

1025
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:33,480
But they failed to factor in the dark energy equations.

1026
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,280
They can tunnel through from their universe, but once they're here, they're dependent on local transportation.

1027
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,620
If they knew what we were doing with entanglement...

1028
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:43,880
Yes, ma'am.

1029
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,120
Listen to me.

1030
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:48,500
I sound like a postdoc.

1031
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:56,120
I'm just so excited to think that we'll finally have the chance to work together I think she likes me.

1032
01:22:56,120 --> 01:22:56,400
Where was I?

1033
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:57,320
It was coffin.

1034
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:02,720
Oh, yes Dr. Kleiner compressed a Zen relay far beyond anything he imagined a black mason.

1035
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:10,040
We've figured out how to use Zen as an unexpressed axis Effectively a dimensional slingshot so we can swing around the border.

1036
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:10,420
We're so cute.

1037
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,760
Come back in local space without having to pass through

1038
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:45,760
oh here's a there he is all right good you keep right up Eli look who I found in the airlock hi Gordon Freeman let me get a look at you man my god you haven't changed one iota how do you do it now let's see the last time I saw you I sent you up for help after the resonance cascade yeah I never thought it would take you this long to get back to me welcome to the lab anyway Black Mesa,

1039
01:23:45,940 --> 01:23:47,580
but it served us well enough.

1040
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,980
It's going to be a lot more like Black Mesa with Gordon here to help.

1041
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,020
Right, you are.

1042
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,720
MIT graduates are few and far between these days.

1043
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:00,500
We'll get you out of that hazard suit and back into your lab coat where you belong.

1044
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:01,100
What?

1045
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,480
Let me just finish up some work and I'll see what I can dig up.

1046
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:07,000
Dr. Freeman, it's been a real honor.

1047
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:09,100
I'm looking forward to working together.

1048
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:11,880
I think she likes me.

1049
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:12,960
Feel free to look around.

1050
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:15,480
I will.

1051
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:16,420
Hi, buddy.

1052
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,800
Oh, did you just shoot me away?

1053
01:24:20,260 --> 01:24:22,420
The Eli Vance has earned our trust.

1054
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:24,800
Oh, he's trying to kiss me.

1055
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:28,960
You remember my wife, Ozzy, and don't you?

1056
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:29,600
Aw.

1057
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:34,980
That picture and Alex were all I managed to carry out of Black Mesa.

1058
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,040
Eli saw me looking.

1059
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,000
Looking what?

1060
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:40,940
Looking at what?

1061
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:50,800
They...

1062
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,420
Hmm.

1063
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:54,120
What's that?

1064
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,240
It's in here.

1065
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:57,120
It's locked.

1066
01:24:58,140 --> 01:24:58,340
Oh!

1067
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:01,060
The Vortigant said you were here.

1068
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,000
I can't believe you made it so quickly on foot.

1069
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:04,600
I'm just that good!

1070
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,500
I believe he broke your record, honey.

1071
01:25:06,740 --> 01:25:08,300
Well, he earned it.

1072
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:10,840
I guess you proved you can handle yourself out there.

1073
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:16,300
There's nothing Gordon can't handle, with the possible exception of you.

1074
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:17,560
Dad, please.

1075
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:18,220
Ah!

1076
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:19,480
Ah!

1077
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:20,340
Ah!

1078
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:20,760
Ah!

1079
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:24,000
Did he just wink at me?

1080
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:24,900
Sir?

1081
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:28,920
Where are we going?

1082
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:32,880
Take a look at this, Gordon.

1083
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:34,900
She's on top of me.

1084
01:25:35,480 --> 01:25:36,160
Holy cow!

1085
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,000
Woo!

1086
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:40,300
I'm taking a look, sir!

1087
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:46,600
Give me...

1088
01:25:48,860 --> 01:25:49,420
Wow!

1089
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,440
Oh!

1090
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:02,960
What changes?

1091
01:26:08,580 --> 01:26:10,540
Alex, I thought you were on watch.

1092
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:12,980
The Vortigons relieved me so I could come see Gordon.

1093
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:15,480
Anyway, I should be in here working on the portal.

1094
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:16,640
I am doing science.

1095
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,340
Someone misjudges capacity of the Combine Thyristor.

1096
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,300
Are you blaming me?

1097
01:26:23,980 --> 01:26:25,440
No, not at all.

1098
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,500
It was a calculation error, not a mechanical problem.

1099
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,520
Then maybe you should let me do the calculations next time as well as installing it.

1100
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,620
Alex, really?

1101
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,060
Sometimes I think you deliberately misunderstand me.

1102
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:38,880
Ladies, ladies.

1103
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,240
Why don't you take Gordon along and give him some practice with the gravity gun?

1104
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:43,580
No.

1105
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:43,920
Sure.

1106
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:45,040
Come on, Gordon.

1107
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:45,680
Oh, no.

1108
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:46,760
Let's go have some fun.

1109
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,380
The zero-point energy field manipulator is not a toy, Alex.

1110
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:52,100
Let's get out of here.

1111
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,680
Not the gravity gun.

1112
01:27:03,610 --> 01:27:06,230
I thought we were having a staring contest for a second.

1113
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:07,170
See you in a little while, Gordon.

1114
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,810
See you!

1115
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:11,610
I'm just checking the place out.

1116
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:39,610
out there's a lot going on here so i see you've met dr mossman she's one of the main reasons i spend so much time outside you should hear her drone on about how it should have been her in the black mesa test chamber i like it you sure okay i'm sorry i shouldn't be talking behind her back it just gets a bit claustrophobic down here spill the tea sis that's the old passage to raven home

1117
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:52,650
anymore come on i'm wait not you you're the one reminiscing

1118
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:04,800
we don't go there what if i went there

1119
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,460
something's making noises in here mysterious i think we have an intruder

1120
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:35,550
it sounds spooky down there Don't go there.

1121
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:41,830
Hello.

1122
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,770
You alright?

1123
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,650
She seems a little traumatized.

1124
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:54,000
So, here we are.

1125
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,240
The scrapyard.

1126
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:59,620
This is a gravity gun my father was talking about.

1127
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:04,940
You can call it a zero-point energy field manipulator if you really want to.

1128
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,860
It's designed for handling hazardous materials, but we mainly use it for heavy lifting.

1129
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:13,740
Give it a try.

1130
01:29:15,550 --> 01:29:16,620
Get the gravity gun.

1131
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:17,620
The primary trigger emits a charge.

1132
01:29:18,380 --> 01:29:20,060
You can punch stuff and send it flying.

1133
01:29:21,220 --> 01:29:24,360
I found it handy for clearing minefields.

1134
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:28,020
So how do I use it?

1135
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:28,760
Boom!

1136
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,000
The secondary trigger lets you grab things.

1137
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,720
You can throw them with the primary.

1138
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:41,060
Once you've picked something up, you can drop it gently by pressing your secondary trigger again.

1139
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:42,800
Pick up some stuff and toss it.

1140
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,240
Oh.

1141
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:46,860
Oh!

1142
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,120
Guys?

1143
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,460
Is this fake rock?

1144
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,780
Is it like a wallpaper?

1145
01:29:58,520 --> 01:29:59,640
Oh, my God.

1146
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:01,700
Try grabbing those barrels from that ledge up there.

1147
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:05,760
All right.

1148
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,400
Oh, I threw paint!

1149
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,220
Oh, it was paint!

1150
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:14,920
Oh, cute!

1151
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,030
See if you can stack some stuff to climb up here.

1152
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,360
Good enough.

1153
01:30:24,260 --> 01:30:25,580
Yeah, yeah.

1154
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:27,020
We're gaming.

1155
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,520
I like the sound it makes.

1156
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:32,480
I'm working on it.

1157
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,600
Grab something with your secondary trigger.

1158
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,200
Then press the same trigger again to drop it gently.

1159
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:36,960
I'm working!

1160
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:37,940
Get on it!

1161
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:41,780
You are a Jedi now.

1162
01:30:42,220 --> 01:30:44,260
I saw some people saying there was a secret here too.

1163
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:45,540
I will search.

1164
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:47,980
How far can we grab?

1165
01:30:49,740 --> 01:30:50,300
Wow!

1166
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:53,900
Crazy!

1167
01:30:56,080 --> 01:30:56,640
Far!

1168
01:30:57,040 --> 01:30:59,240
Now it feels like portal for real.

1169
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:04,560
Yeah, it does have some range.

1170
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:10,980
Does it have like a charge or anything to it or can I just...

1171
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,180
Go baby, go.

1172
01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:17,100
Oh no, was it up there?

1173
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:19,600
Wait a second.

1174
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,320
Oops.

1175
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:29,030
Soup?

1176
01:31:29,190 --> 01:31:29,910
What about soup?

1177
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:32,430
Why are you guys saying that?

1178
01:31:35,950 --> 01:31:37,390
No ammo needed.

1179
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:39,150
To my right, that one over there?

1180
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,300
Why are you guys saying soup?

1181
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,280
By the white door.

1182
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,540
Okay, I thought it might be another tunnel thing.

1183
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,020
Tunnel situation.

1184
01:31:50,940 --> 01:31:52,540
There's even a toilet in here.

1185
01:31:53,820 --> 01:31:55,980
I hope I didn't need that.

1186
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,100
This G-Man's toilet.

1187
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:11,920
Wait.

1188
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:13,400
Oh, I need to get up here.

1189
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:15,320
Come on.

1190
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:16,320
Come on.

1191
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:17,280
Come on.

1192
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,440
Oh wait.

1193
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,160
Maybe here.

1194
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,040
I need a bigger.

1195
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:29,340
Bigger.

1196
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:29,920
Oh!

1197
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:30,880
No, I fell!

1198
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:31,240
No!

1199
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:33,540
Oh, man.

1200
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:35,240
How did that happen?

1201
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:36,340
Oh.

1202
01:32:41,670 --> 01:32:42,650
Take two.

1203
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:48,720
Okay.

1204
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:52,920
Um, let's do this one instead.

1205
01:32:54,500 --> 01:32:55,180
Okay.

1206
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,800
Okay, oh, oh,

1207
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:34,630
that's the Easter egg, the panel.

1208
01:33:37,170 --> 01:33:42,150
Oh, find the HEV suit charger faceplate in Eli's scrapyard.

1209
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:46,210
Oh.

1210
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,910
Mmm, soup is what the grab gun says when you click.

1211
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:54,530
Oh.

1212
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:03,650
How do I flip it over?

1213
01:34:07,130 --> 01:34:07,950
Oh!

1214
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:09,230
Cute!

1215
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:15,190
Sorry, I'm okay.

1216
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:17,410
Oh my gosh.

1217
01:34:21,260 --> 01:34:23,700
I'm gonna hear mmm soup every time now.

1218
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:25,740
That's so silly.

1219
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:32,740
Okay.

1220
01:34:33,120 --> 01:34:35,400
Well, thank you guys for the Easter egg.

1221
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,140
That was fun.

1222
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:39,640
Thoroughly enjoyed myself.

1223
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,680
Beware of dog.

1224
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:43,800
We got a dog here.

1225
01:34:45,780 --> 01:34:46,820
Oh, I didn't even...

1226
01:34:46,820 --> 01:34:49,180
Wow, I'm so extra.

1227
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:53,100
Hello.

1228
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:54,820
Now let me call dog.

1229
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,080
He loves to play fetch.

1230
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:57,280
Dog is his name?

1231
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:57,920
Is it a human?

1232
01:34:58,720 --> 01:34:58,940
Dog!

1233
01:34:59,420 --> 01:34:59,820
Dog!

1234
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:12,620
Good doggy.

1235
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,500
Gordon, this is dog.

1236
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:16,300
I want to see the new outfit now.

1237
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:17,280
Be patient.

1238
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:19,760
First model was about yay high.

1239
01:35:20,580 --> 01:35:21,900
I've been adding to him ever since.

1240
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:23,700
Haven't I, boy?

1241
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:24,800
Dog!

1242
01:35:25,120 --> 01:35:25,540
Okay, dog.

1243
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:26,720
Let's play catch with Gordon.

1244
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:27,360
Yeah.

1245
01:35:27,700 --> 01:35:28,980
You'll need to use a gravity gun.

1246
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:29,420
Okay.

1247
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:31,580
Go ahead, dog.

1248
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:31,920
Throw.

1249
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,160
Oh my god, he has his old little dog house.

1250
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:40,600
Oh, I thought he wanted a big...

1251
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,000
Um, big something.

1252
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:44,580
What is it?

1253
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:44,960
What is it?

1254
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,580
Oh, this is so cute too!

1255
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,880
Oh, throw another dog!

1256
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:54,640
Okay, okay.

1257
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:06,930
Why doesn't he, why doesn't he pick it up?

1258
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:11,670
Meow!

1259
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:13,010
Go ahead, dog.

1260
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:13,370
Throw!

1261
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,150
Throw!

1262
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,580
I knew it was this.

1263
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:32,080
I knew it.

1264
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:32,780
I knew it.

1265
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:40,130
What is that thing?

1266
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:48,690
Get it, boy.

1267
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:52,120
Do it, dog.

1268
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:54,720
I got I know I throw it.

1269
01:36:55,340 --> 01:36:55,860
You catch.

1270
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:57,120
You fetch.

1271
01:37:08,060 --> 01:37:09,980
Ah, we're playing game.

1272
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:11,040
This is the game.

1273
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,040
He got it.

1274
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:15,740
He got it.

1275
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:24,080
We're playing catch.

1276
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:25,600
We're playing catch.

1277
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,480
Where do we get?

1278
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:33,000
I didn't tell you who'd be fetching.

1279
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:33,520
Ouch.

1280
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:37,740
Where'd he go?

1281
01:37:45,230 --> 01:37:47,490
How much longer do I have to do this?

1282
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:51,190
So did...

1283
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:52,350
All right, Gordon, let's try something else.

1284
01:37:53,130 --> 01:37:54,230
Dog, throw something bigger.

1285
01:37:54,610 --> 01:37:54,910
Bigger?

1286
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:02,450
What's then there in your...

1287
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:05,650
in your dumpster of dreams?

1288
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:06,830
Is it empty?

1289
01:38:07,050 --> 01:38:07,870
Oh, he's so cute.

1290
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:08,370
No, Dog.

1291
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:10,470
No, no, boy.

1292
01:38:10,650 --> 01:38:10,930
Get down.

1293
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:11,870
Put that down.

1294
01:38:12,030 --> 01:38:12,430
Oh.

1295
01:38:13,510 --> 01:38:14,430
What is it, Dog?

1296
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:14,910
Oh no.

1297
01:38:15,550 --> 01:38:16,870
Oh my god, what was that?

1298
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:17,690
Temper tantrum?

1299
01:38:18,470 --> 01:38:18,790
Scanners?

1300
01:38:18,970 --> 01:38:19,370
Scanners?

1301
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:21,150
Oh, the combine's sweeping the area.

1302
01:38:21,630 --> 01:38:22,850
We've got to head back to the lab.

1303
01:38:22,990 --> 01:38:23,570
Come on, Gordon.

1304
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:25,090
Oh my god.

1305
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:25,650
Uh-oh.

1306
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:26,990
Uh-oh.

1307
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:27,210
Uh-oh.

1308
01:38:33,020 --> 01:38:33,860
Alex, you good?

1309
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:35,900
Dog!

1310
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:36,880
Dog!

1311
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,340
Get inside, dog.

1312
01:38:44,620 --> 01:38:45,960
What's going on in there?

1313
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:47,200
Where are you, Alex?

1314
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:50,140
We're in the scrapyard airlock stuck in a full auto cycle.

1315
01:38:50,440 --> 01:38:51,620
Is Gordon still with you?

1316
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,360
He's right here.

1317
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:52,760
Hi.

1318
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,280
Two, two, two.

1319
01:38:57,680 --> 01:38:58,920
Take Gordon out of here.

1320
01:38:59,180 --> 01:38:59,960
Head for the coast.

1321
01:39:00,360 --> 01:39:00,600
No!

1322
01:39:00,900 --> 01:39:01,760
Do not go through rape.

1323
01:39:02,380 --> 01:39:02,800
Dad?

1324
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:03,700
Dad!

1325
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,200
Damn it!

1326
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:06,560
Dog, open the airlock.

1327
01:39:06,680 --> 01:39:07,340
Get us out of here.

1328
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:09,440
Dog?

1329
01:39:10,980 --> 01:39:12,020
Uh-oh.

1330
01:39:12,740 --> 01:39:13,660
Uh-oh.

1331
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:15,540
Uh-oh.

1332
01:39:15,540 --> 01:39:15,740
Uh-oh.

1333
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:15,960
Uh-oh.

1334
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:16,000
Uh-oh.

1335
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:16,660
That's enough, dog.

1336
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:19,680
Wait, dog's coming with you.

1337
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:20,200
Come on, Gordon.

1338
01:39:21,460 --> 01:39:22,280
Come on!

1339
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,020
I'm trying.

1340
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:23,740
I'm trying to move.

1341
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,840
I've tried... I... I can't... Okay.

1342
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,660
You're coming with us, right, dog?

1343
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:35,960
Oh my god.

1344
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:37,800
He's the one causing the avalanche.

1345
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:38,620
Oh my god.

1346
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:43,580
I can pick him up!

1347
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,240
Gordon, you need to get out of here.

1348
01:39:45,560 --> 01:39:47,000
I can't leave my father.

1349
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:52,420
Dog, take Gordon to the Ravenholm tunnel and circle around and try to meet up with me.

1350
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:53,160
Hurry!

1351
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:54,780
I can pick it up!

1352
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:55,860
I can pick it up!

1353
01:39:58,600 --> 01:39:59,600
Where did she- where did she sit?

1354
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,060
Oh my god.

1355
01:40:01,080 --> 01:40:01,940
It's suddenly so loud.

1356
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:07,740
Where- what she said- Oh but we- oh- Is this a-

1357
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:13,120
But I was told no!

1358
01:40:14,540 --> 01:40:16,360
He said go through, right?

1359
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:19,900
What's Ravenholm?

1360
01:40:20,040 --> 01:40:21,420
You guys are scaring me!

1361
01:40:32,200 --> 01:40:33,920
You're about to find out.

1362
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:41,530
Oh, baby.

1363
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,850
Stop.

1364
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:03,250
How do I get through?

1365
01:41:06,690 --> 01:41:07,190
Oops.

1366
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:09,250
Wait, was I supposed to jump on top of that?

1367
01:41:10,410 --> 01:41:11,290
I sure hope not.

1368
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:15,650
I did just save you guys, please.

1369
01:41:16,330 --> 01:41:16,930
It's okay.

1370
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,000
Left click the green thing.

1371
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:31,840
Oh, I forgot that I can left click.

1372
01:41:32,140 --> 01:41:32,400
Thank you.

1373
01:41:34,100 --> 01:41:38,840
Like, I knew that I could pick up stuff up and left click, but I forgot that I can just left click.

1374
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:44,620
That doesn't seem good, right?

1375
01:42:06,730 --> 01:42:08,690
They're not watching for you?

1376
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:19,540
What a thrill.

1377
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,560
What killed the head crab?

1378
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:34,880
I'm so scared!

1379
01:42:38,060 --> 01:42:42,180
What a thrill with darkness.

1380
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,580
And silence for the night.

1381
01:42:46,660 --> 01:42:47,520
A gun!

1382
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:00,060
We don't go to Raven home.

1383
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:16,060
Thank you.

1384
01:43:16,280 --> 01:43:17,440
This is my favorite part of this game.

1385
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:20,980
Remember when you said Half-Life 2 felt like a horror game?

1386
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:24,160
I can't...

1387
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,960
Oh my gosh, the music is so loud.

1388
01:43:27,980 --> 01:43:28,480
Oh!

1389
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:30,500
Are those Pats?

1390
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:43,280
I keep hearing talking, but I can't tell if it's like a guy's radio or what, you know?

1391
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:48,740
Because the music is so stinking loud.

1392
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,600
Is this suddenly a horror game for real?

1393
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:02,050
Look at them Pats!

1394
01:44:07,100 --> 01:44:07,660
Ooh.

1395
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:10,340
Ooh, buddy.

1396
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:30,680
It's a fun challenge to try to use only the gravity gun here.

1397
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:33,160
Okay, I'll try.

1398
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:37,640
Oh, wait, this is real.

1399
01:44:38,980 --> 01:44:40,020
Oh, my god.

1400
01:44:44,780 --> 01:44:47,140
How am I supposed to use the gravity gun on this man?

1401
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:52,360
Anything I can pick up and throw at you?

1402
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:55,220
Oh no, it's suddenly zombies.

1403
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:57,080
I'm playing Resident Evil again.

1404
01:44:58,200 --> 01:44:59,160
Throw objects.

1405
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:01,080
But what can I throw at him?

1406
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:01,300
Oh.

1407
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:04,800
Okay.

1408
01:45:06,260 --> 01:45:07,040
Oh, bye.

1409
01:45:13,110 --> 01:45:14,270
See that sign.

1410
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:16,210
I got it before you guys even said anything.

1411
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:22,640
Uh-oh.

1412
01:45:22,940 --> 01:45:24,100
Zombie game time?

1413
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:26,340
Why can't I pick up people?

1414
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:29,100
Look at the claw.

1415
01:45:31,700 --> 01:45:32,120
Wow.

1416
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:34,770
Oh, come here, come here.

1417
01:45:36,440 --> 01:45:36,560
Ha!

1418
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:44,680
Soon?

1419
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:45,540
Okay.

1420
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,920
That guy looks alive.

1421
01:45:50,900 --> 01:45:51,480
Come here, come here.

1422
01:46:00,940 --> 01:46:02,520
Oh, how could I I missed.

1423
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:04,940
Oh, wait.

1424
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:06,600
That's exciting.

1425
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:13,140
Um.

1426
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:14,300
Oh, my God!

1427
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,160
Whoa!

1428
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:21,360
I just realized what happened to him.

1429
01:46:21,940 --> 01:46:22,480
Whoa.

1430
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:30,260
Oh, my gosh.

1431
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,800
Oh, can I please get through here?

1432
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:51,400
It's kind of sick chat

1435
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:35,890
Where'd the saw go?

1436
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:36,730
Saw?

1437
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:39,190
Hey, back off!

1438
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:40,750
Back off, buddy!

1439
01:47:41,250 --> 01:47:42,810
Where'd the saw go?

1440
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:49,430
That works.

1441
01:47:52,910 --> 01:47:53,950
You have other guns?

1442
01:47:54,150 --> 01:47:54,450
Yeah.

1443
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:58,350
I know, but I wanted to try and see if I could get the achievement.

1444
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,140
Let's see.

1445
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:05,800
Look, here's one.

1446
01:48:05,900 --> 01:48:06,620
Oh, there it is.

1447
01:48:06,660 --> 01:48:07,300
It went under the top.

1448
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:08,540
table, that's why.

1449
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:10,140
Okay.

1450
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:15,760
Toofer!

1451
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,280
Nice.

1452
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:28,140
Run away, run away, run away.

1453
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,300
Wait, this way?

1454
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:33,880
I kill him.

1455
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:38,220
Sometimes they survive, and sometimes they don't.

1456
01:48:42,040 --> 01:48:42,920
Okay.

1457
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:46,260
Okay, okay, okay, okay, we're getting it, we're getting it.

1458
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,420
Let's take the other one, too.

1459
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:55,420
Oh, okay, these are all flammable.

1460
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,120
I could have just used that.

1461
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,360
So freaky.

1462
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:05,380
Where'd the other one go?

1463
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:07,040
Oh, there it is.

1464
01:49:12,110 --> 01:49:15,870
I'm, like, collecting supplies to grow.

1465
01:49:21,890 --> 01:49:22,890
Was it burping?

1466
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:24,730
Okay.

1467
01:49:24,750 --> 01:49:26,970
I don't know how to do that.

1468
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:38,330
Oh, come on!

1469
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:41,570
Wait, this is kind of great, no?

1470
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:51,730
Who said that?

1471
01:49:56,310 --> 01:49:57,230
Anything in here?

1472
01:49:57,710 --> 01:49:57,710
Oh!

1473
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:00,630
Stop, stop.

1474
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:09,670
I am.

1475
01:50:13,190 --> 01:50:13,690
Oh,

1476
01:50:16,850 --> 01:50:18,270
it's so gross.

1477
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:19,570
Oh, my gosh.

1478
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:21,430
Okay, I'm being a little baby about this all.

1479
01:50:21,610 --> 01:50:22,150
I'll keep going.

1480
01:50:25,090 --> 01:50:25,110
Where?

1481
01:50:27,330 --> 01:50:27,930
Oh, there.

1482
01:50:28,430 --> 01:50:29,770
Oh, seriously?

1483
01:50:31,630 --> 01:50:31,990
Um.

1484
01:50:35,530 --> 01:50:37,270
Oh, they throw stuff too.

1485
01:50:38,590 --> 01:50:40,030
That's why we played cat.

1486
01:50:48,380 --> 01:50:51,800
I could turn it off or

1487
01:50:57,410 --> 01:51:02,130
I lost my saws you guys I have nothing

1488
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:19,500
there will be more will there wait I think I had one left here okay

1489
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:26,780
okay let's go I

1490
01:51:37,270 --> 01:51:50,230
saw one For the days of my life has vanished like smoke, and my bones are parched like ash, and let all my impurities be as fuel for that fire and for nothing remains.

1491
01:51:53,580 --> 01:51:54,880
Oh, there's many more!

1492
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,100
Let's go.

1493
01:51:58,200 --> 01:51:58,400
Oops.

1494
01:52:03,640 --> 01:52:04,600
Spin to wean.

1495
01:52:16,170 --> 01:52:16,850
Oh, I hear him.

1496
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:17,410
I hear him coming.

1497
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:20,370
Oh, my gosh.

1498
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:21,430
Where'd you guys come from?

1499
01:52:22,370 --> 01:52:23,270
Over here.

1500
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:27,690
Oh, I see you, I see you.

1501
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:32,030
And a little...

1502
01:52:32,570 --> 01:52:33,810
Oh, gosh!

1503
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:37,670
Did I get him?

1504
01:52:38,070 --> 01:52:38,650
I think so.

1505
01:52:43,070 --> 01:52:43,710
Okay.

1506
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:45,030
Lucky.

1507
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:48,070
Lucky, lucky.

1508
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:49,650
I didn't even see these...

1509
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:52,590
Ah-ha-ha.

1510
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:54,630
They were having a little...

1511
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,550
feast, eh?

1512
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:58,110
I see.

1513
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:03,980
What the?

1514
01:53:04,180 --> 01:53:04,660
Where did...

1515
01:53:04,660 --> 01:53:06,240
Holy cow!

1516
01:53:07,880 --> 01:53:09,260
Where did he come from?

1517
01:53:09,580 --> 01:53:11,660
Wait, was he... No, that guy was killed.

1518
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,020
Where did he come from?

1519
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:16,060
Okay.

1520
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:27,940
Area is so scary.

1521
01:53:29,980 --> 01:53:31,080
You love physics.

1522
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:32,140
Beat!

1523
01:53:32,140 --> 01:53:32,720
Two!

1524
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:34,620
Oh shoot.

1525
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:36,420
I forgot that.

1526
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:36,660
Ow!

1527
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:43,550
Leave me alone.

1528
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:43,930
Oh!

1529
01:53:46,050 --> 01:53:47,670
That got me a little bit of that.

1530
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:51,830
I'm just gonna get more health.

1531
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:56,750
Overkill.

1532
01:53:57,690 --> 01:53:58,890
For a single head crab?

1533
01:53:59,570 --> 01:53:59,930
Never.

1534
01:54:01,730 --> 01:54:03,370
Head crab's evil.

1535
01:54:06,210 --> 01:54:07,650
I hear them.

1536
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:08,810
They're so scary.

1537
01:54:13,440 --> 01:54:16,480
May they become like dust before the wind.

1538
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:19,320
May the angel of the Lord pursue them.

1539
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:20,740
Oops.

1540
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:21,160
Ow!

1541
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:22,660
Hey!

1542
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:24,960
You chill out.

1543
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,020
You chill out.

1544
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,580
There you are.

1545
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:30,120
Come here.

1546
01:54:32,820 --> 01:54:33,640
No, no, no.

1547
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:33,960
Come back.

1548
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:34,260
Wait.

1549
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:34,740
No, no.

1550
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:35,180
Come back.

1551
01:54:35,940 --> 01:54:37,080
Come back.

1552
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:40,060
What's going on in there?

1553
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:40,760
Hot dog!

1554
01:54:41,440 --> 01:54:44,180
Imagine experiencing all those physics in 2004.

1555
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,120
Crazy, right?

1556
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:47,600
Whoop!

1557
01:54:51,030 --> 01:54:52,990
Are your head crabs okay?

1558
01:54:56,670 --> 01:54:58,530
I guess that guy's dead.

1559
01:54:59,110 --> 01:54:59,870
He's not moving.

1560
01:55:07,420 --> 01:55:08,760
Leave me alone!

1561
01:55:09,640 --> 01:55:10,920
This guy's dead.

1562
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:11,600
He's fine.

1563
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:18,960
Okay.

1564
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:22,700
Do I get the achievement if I use my...

1565
01:55:23,280 --> 01:55:23,680
This?

1566
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:25,940
Now I just realize.

1567
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,700
Did I just ruin the...

1568
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,700
Did I just ruin the...

1569
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:35,340
Did I kill the achievement?

1570
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,600
Vivikor, thank you for the five gifted.

1571
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:45,080
It's okay.

1572
01:55:45,160 --> 01:55:46,900
I like learning the gravity gun anyway.

1573
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:47,420
Oh, wait.

1574
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:48,520
So it's okay.

1575
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:51,480
Oops.

1576
01:55:52,660 --> 01:55:53,300
know there was achievement.

1577
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,540
That's what people were saying.

1578
01:55:54,600 --> 01:55:57,120
If I use the gravity gun this whole section, I'll get an achievement.

1579
01:55:57,340 --> 01:55:58,920
I kind of wanted to try for it.

1580
01:55:59,580 --> 01:56:00,000
But it's okay.

1581
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,200
I'm not so serious about that stuff anyway.

1582
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:13,630
Yeah, it's all good.

1583
01:56:14,770 --> 01:56:16,030
I just wanted the challenge.

1584
01:56:20,110 --> 01:56:21,390
Oh, it's too far.

1585
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:23,690
Oh my gosh.

1586
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:24,790
It's so creepy.

1587
01:56:25,330 --> 01:56:25,970
Oh, he's dead.

1588
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:37,570
This area what the hell do I even need this everything is flammable

1589
01:56:41,340 --> 01:57:03,940
oh there he is are you shooting at me hi well who is this another life to save yeah I'll keep my eye on you more than What if I kill him right now?

1590
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:10,680
Cool, let's go.

1591
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:15,000
He just keeps this perpetual fire going to protect himself.

1592
01:57:15,600 --> 01:57:16,480
That's kind of genius.

1593
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,960
The best barbecue in town, baby.

1594
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:24,560
Um,

1595
01:57:30,660 --> 01:57:31,380
where did my thing go?

1596
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:35,580
I think I have another saw over here.

1597
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:38,720
There it is.

1598
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:55,040
anything over here i don't

1599
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:05,720

1600
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:15,560
stop giving me health my gosh Ouch!

1601
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:18,080
Oop!

1602
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:21,680
Nice slice.

1603
01:58:23,780 --> 01:58:25,360
You could use the med kit.

1604
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:27,620
I'm actually okay.

1605
01:58:28,320 --> 01:58:29,880
That's why it's not using it.

1606
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,900
They just sound like crying babies.

1607
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:39,720
It's so creepy.

1608
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:41,660
Wait, so if I...

1609
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:45,380
Okay, okay, okay.

1610
01:58:45,820 --> 01:58:48,240
I thought that was the case, but...

1611
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:52,620
I wasn't sure if I needed to go through here either.

1612
01:58:53,740 --> 01:58:55,740
Oh god, it's so scary.

1613
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:57,140
Nope.

1614
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:02,120
Well, that explains it.

1615
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:03,360
There's nothing in here.

1616
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:07,080
Took gold through.

1617
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:09,040
Oh!

1618
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:15,740
Is that gas?

1619
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:20,160
Overkill, baby!

1620
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:22,340
Oh!

1621
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:23,280
Oh!

1622
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:29,870
Oh,

1623
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:35,010
I guess a knob would have done it, too.

1624
01:59:35,470 --> 01:59:35,890
Oh, well.

1625
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:43,710
It's got his little, like, butcher area.

1626
01:59:44,490 --> 01:59:46,230
This is pretty messed up.

1627
01:59:49,350 --> 01:59:49,910
Fire.

1628
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:51,130
Fire!

1629
01:59:54,950 --> 01:59:55,710
Nice.

1630
01:59:58,130 --> 02:00:02,730
Do we go through the spooky dark passageway or do we go through the lit passageway?

1631
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:10,230
The lit passageway that leads to the man that is alive and well.

1632
02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:13,790
I keep hearing them.

1633
02:00:13,970 --> 02:00:14,730
They're so scary.

1634
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:20,610
Let's try the spooky dark way.

1635
02:00:23,270 --> 02:00:25,630
Let's try the lit way.

1636
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:33,420
Bunk.

1637
02:00:35,720 --> 02:00:36,600
Slowly but surely.

1638
02:00:37,980 --> 02:00:38,660
Oh my gosh.

1639
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:39,820
Oh.

1640
02:00:40,220 --> 02:00:40,480
Ouch!

1641
02:00:42,180 --> 02:00:42,620
Jerk!

1642
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:50,020
I missed.

1643
02:00:57,680 --> 02:00:58,760
Come here.

1644
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:03,760
Oh, tiny scrap.

1645
02:01:03,880 --> 02:01:04,600
No, needed.

1646
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:06,220
Big scrap.

1647
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:07,620
Needed.

1648
02:01:11,660 --> 02:01:13,300
Is that a guy in there?

1649
02:01:14,260 --> 02:01:16,000
I'm just pushing all of this over.

1650
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:27,680
That's it.

1651
02:01:27,940 --> 02:01:28,940
He gave up.

1652
02:01:33,140 --> 02:01:34,560
Will this reach in there?

1653
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,340
One way to find out.

1654
02:01:40,280 --> 02:01:41,020
Oh, it did!

1655
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:41,820
Wow!

1656
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,940
Lending my hand.

1657
02:01:45,960 --> 02:01:47,460
There's another guy in there, though.

1658
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,260
I see it.

1659
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:51,680
I don't think that worked.

1660
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:56,120
Oh well.

1661
02:01:57,900 --> 02:01:59,080
What's up here anyway?

1662
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:09,090
What is all this?

1663
02:02:11,470 --> 02:02:12,290
You sure you're dead?

1664
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:16,970
He's just moving furniture.

1665
02:02:19,110 --> 02:02:22,430
He's trying to barricade the door to keep the Freeman monster out.

1666
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:25,450
Headcraft victims are still conscious but trapped in their bodies.

1667
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:26,330
They feel everything.

1668
02:02:27,430 --> 02:02:29,250
Those moans are a reverse speech?

1669
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:30,970
What are they saying?

1670
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:38,560
Oh, I want my saw back.

1671
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:44,980
Help me in reverse?

1672
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:46,260
Ew!

1673
02:02:48,200 --> 02:02:49,040
Ow!

1674
02:02:54,640 --> 02:02:57,740
I didn't think that one through guys.

1675
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:58,640
My bad.

1676
02:03:11,300 --> 02:03:11,940
All right.

1677
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:20,210
We should leave.

1678
02:03:23,710 --> 02:03:34,250
It did to me sound like they're going like, oh god, no, oh god, that's what it sounded like to me, but if it's reversed, that makes sense too.

1679
02:03:39,820 --> 02:03:41,700
There was a whole party going on there.

1680
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:53,260
These are dangerous to have, but...

1681
02:04:02,490 --> 02:04:03,870
Yeah, stupid.

1682
02:04:05,550 --> 02:04:05,930
instead.

1683
02:04:09,250 --> 02:04:10,170
Nice reflexes.

1684
02:04:10,390 --> 02:04:10,630
Thank you.

1685
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:17,290
Oh my god.

1686
02:04:19,710 --> 02:04:20,350
Oh, I missed.

1687
02:04:20,590 --> 02:04:22,110
Oh, I thought it would be a bigger explosion.

1688
02:04:22,770 --> 02:04:23,270
Oh, no.

1689
02:04:24,550 --> 02:04:25,310
There's my saw.

1690
02:04:26,150 --> 02:04:26,650
We're fine.

1691
02:04:27,590 --> 02:04:29,230
Oh, I keep pressing the wrong thing.

1692
02:04:29,370 --> 02:04:31,830
Because I don't want to, like, accidentally...

1693
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:32,310
What's the word?

1694
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:35,250
Press...

1695
02:04:35,250 --> 02:04:37,470
You know if I'm, like, trying to...

1696
02:04:37,490 --> 02:05:01,570
set it down but i accidentally throw it and then explode myself you know that's what i'm trying to not have happen that's what i'm trying to avoid so yeah i feel like it will happen i mean yeah

1697
02:05:05,720 --> 02:05:12,400
so i'm more cautious about pressing The right button, then the left, you know?

1698
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:17,000
Just to make sure.

1699
02:05:19,660 --> 02:05:21,100
The splash damage.

1700
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:23,120
Oh, my gosh.

1701
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:24,560
What is that?

1702
02:05:26,540 --> 02:05:27,660
Wait, what the hell?

1703
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,040
What is this?

1704
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,100
I got a gun.

1705
02:05:41,060 --> 02:05:42,180
Oh, no, it's those.

1706
02:05:42,600 --> 02:05:43,640
What does that mean?

1707
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,420
I haven't saved in a bit.

1708
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:45,960
Let's do that.

1709
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:48,600
Thank you so much for the thank you, thank you!

1710
02:06:07,700 --> 02:06:08,700
She peeking.

1711
02:06:09,340 --> 02:06:12,920
I'm just, I'm admiring this lovely night.

1712
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:16,980
I'm not gonna lie, the sound of the gravity gun does kind of get annoying.

1713
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:20,980
Like that, zoom, zoom, constantly.

1714
02:06:22,420 --> 02:06:24,280
Constantly feel like I need to lower the volume.

1715
02:06:26,600 --> 02:06:27,680
What do I do?

1716
02:06:27,700 --> 02:06:28,340
go from here?

1717
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:29,940
Oh, I guess?

1718
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:37,200
Oh, that that secret, not secret area, the uh, the area that I turned off the fire before.

1719
02:06:40,980 --> 02:06:45,120
Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

1720
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:45,540
Oh.

1721
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:53,020
It's the poison guys, are you dead?

1722
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:53,860
They're poison?

1723
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:00,200
Oh!

1724
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:01,540
Oh

1725
02:07:06,650 --> 02:07:18,160
my gosh, there's more guys coming, please!

1726
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:19,460
I killed all you!

1727
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:25,660
Are you dead yet?

1728
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:30,060
These guys kind of suck.

1729
02:07:31,280 --> 02:07:32,540
Are they only in this area?

1730
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:33,400
Please say yes.

1731
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:37,780
Please say yes.

1732
02:07:42,440 --> 02:07:43,120
No!

1733
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:43,860
Boo!

1734
02:07:46,300 --> 02:07:47,860
Well, we'll get through it.

1735
02:07:49,200 --> 02:07:50,380
We'll get through it, I believe.

1736
02:07:53,060 --> 02:08:03,220
I keep being paranoid because I keep thinking I'm hearing guys going, I mean, they're everywhere, so I'm going to hear them, but...

1737
02:08:03,220 --> 02:08:03,420
Okay.

1738
02:08:07,690 --> 02:08:11,010
Okay, maybe I can lead them into killing both of them at once.

1739
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:13,070
Oh, all three of them.

1740
02:08:13,370 --> 02:08:14,030
Okay, come on, come on.

1741
02:08:15,630 --> 02:08:16,230
Come here.

1742
02:08:17,390 --> 02:08:18,110
Oh,

1743
02:08:21,430 --> 02:08:22,830
that doesn't work anymore.

1744
02:08:26,150 --> 02:08:27,230
Just kidding.

1745
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:33,720
Yes!

1746
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:35,180
Oh my gosh.

1747
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:38,480
There he goes.

1748
02:08:44,370 --> 02:08:44,730
Woof!

1749
02:08:47,070 --> 02:08:48,270
Thanks, guys.

1750
02:08:49,770 --> 02:08:53,210
I probably killed all the head grabs that were alive.

1751
02:08:54,930 --> 02:08:58,050
Oh, Mr. Priest, you gotta let me in?

1752
02:09:00,130 --> 02:09:04,070
You gotta let a gal in, please?

1753
02:09:08,940 --> 02:09:10,500
I'm hearing someone.

1754
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:14,900
Oh, golly.

1755
02:09:19,720 --> 02:09:20,780
What's that sound?

1756
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:25,180
Oh, that was me losing my, my saw.

1757
02:09:25,560 --> 02:09:26,160
That's fine.

1758
02:09:26,620 --> 02:09:27,680
I suppose.

1759
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:30,660
I'll be safe on the roof, really?

1760
02:09:33,540 --> 02:09:34,840
Is that true?

1761
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:37,880
Do I just jump over there?

1762
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:40,480
Actually, I guess so.

1763
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:44,340
Oh, hi.

1764
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,600
Well done, brother.

1765
02:09:46,460 --> 02:09:48,140
Make free use of my traps.

1766
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:51,320
But take care not to fall in them yourself.

1767
02:09:52,900 --> 02:09:54,100
Behind you.

1768
02:09:57,990 --> 02:10:02,310
you do well to be vigilant um

1769
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:11,280

02:10:14,700 --> 02:10:20,440

1772
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,120
I almost missed it, for real.

1773
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:41,280
Oh!

1774
02:10:41,820 --> 02:10:42,440
I see her.

1775
02:10:53,820 --> 02:10:54,840
Oh, did I...

1776
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:02,060
Where's the gamer yellow?

1777
02:11:02,860 --> 02:11:03,320
Yeah!

1778
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:11,210
Oh, gosh.

1779
02:11:11,950 --> 02:11:12,770
I don't know if...

1780
02:11:12,770 --> 02:11:13,630
Oh, my gosh.

1781
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:24,210
Okay.

1782
02:11:24,370 --> 02:11:26,550
I'm glad I can at least use it on these guys.

1783
02:11:26,670 --> 02:11:27,490
It's nice.

1784
02:11:32,970 --> 02:11:34,430
Except when they miss.

1785
02:11:39,790 --> 02:11:40,430
Quispy.

1786
02:11:41,510 --> 02:11:42,150
Like I did?

1787
02:11:45,550 --> 02:11:45,770
Oh.

1788
02:11:47,590 --> 02:11:49,150
I'm locking on something.

1789
02:11:51,410 --> 02:11:51,490
Hmm.

1790
02:11:54,090 --> 02:11:54,390
Okay.

1791
02:11:55,090 --> 02:11:55,710
Let's go.

1792
02:11:57,470 --> 02:11:58,210
Okay.

1793
02:11:58,230 --> 02:11:59,370
Locking it on something.

1794
02:11:59,590 --> 02:12:01,150
I can't tell what, though.

1795
02:12:04,990 --> 02:12:05,550
Hmm.

1796
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:08,110
That's not a door.

1797
02:12:13,580 --> 02:12:14,600
Oh, sick.

1798
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:20,090
There's a crab in here, maybe.

1799
02:12:26,260 --> 02:12:26,600
Oh.

1800
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:30,310
Oh my gosh.

1801
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:31,410
It's so creepy.

1802
02:12:31,950 --> 02:12:33,370
Hearing them just moaning.

1803
02:12:34,830 --> 02:12:36,050
I don't like it.

1804
02:12:37,350 --> 02:12:37,490
it.

1805
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:38,510
Wait, is this a trap?

1806
02:12:39,030 --> 02:12:39,570
What does it do?

1807
02:12:40,470 --> 02:12:41,910
I guess we'll find out.

1808
02:12:46,770 --> 02:12:47,750
Oh, geez.

1809
02:12:49,250 --> 02:12:49,830
I missed.

1810
02:12:51,310 --> 02:12:51,310
Um.

1811
02:12:55,570 --> 02:12:58,410
Well, it would have been really nice to know what it did.

1812
02:13:01,110 --> 02:13:01,870
Uh, shoot.

1813
02:13:02,090 --> 02:13:02,670
I'm trapped.

1814
02:13:03,650 --> 02:13:04,630
Um, I'll loop them.

1815
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:13,880
Where do you go?

1816
02:13:14,020 --> 02:13:17,040
At least they're going to run eventually.

1817
02:13:19,720 --> 02:13:21,480
Don't tell me that they're going to run eventually.

1818
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:22,600
Ouch.

1819
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:25,480
Oh, gosh.

1820
02:13:32,700 --> 02:13:33,560
Oh, my God.

1821
02:13:37,320 --> 02:13:37,820
Okay.

1822
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:43,060
Don't smile.

1823
02:13:43,420 --> 02:13:44,980
You're scaring me.

1824
02:13:47,300 --> 02:13:48,440
Who's this angel?

1825
02:13:48,640 --> 02:13:49,320
Oh, my mistake.

1826
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,420
It's a cute girl.

1827
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:54,420
I need

1828
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:13,750
you all to come here

1829
02:14:19,090 --> 02:14:27,700
Just keep lifting and just wait They never learn

1830
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:37,560
Good Does this work?

1831
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:38,540
Nope, okay

1832
02:14:44,500 --> 02:14:47,500
Okay, it's back up, so I have to remember that.

1833
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:52,220
It's the zombie flattener.

1834
02:14:59,580 --> 02:15:00,060
I...

1835
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:00,440
Okay.

1836
02:15:02,120 --> 02:15:02,560
Oh!

1837
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:05,580
Let's go...

1838
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:07,760
You guys say puzzle time, but I don't even know what the puzzle is?

1839
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:09,460
Oh, I can't go this way.

1840
02:15:10,460 --> 02:15:11,300
Okay, puzzle time!

1841
02:15:14,100 --> 02:15:15,580
Do I need to...

1842
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:17,120
Go, uh, here?

1843
02:15:27,410 --> 02:15:29,750
I got stuck here for 10 minutes?

1844
02:15:30,130 --> 02:15:30,550
Crazy.

1845
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:34,750
I'll double that time.

1846
02:15:35,110 --> 02:15:35,990
No, triple.

1847
02:15:45,040 --> 02:15:47,820
I think I need to jump on top of the cars.

1848
02:15:50,180 --> 02:15:52,860
Oh, but how would I... Maybe this one.

1849
02:16:07,720 --> 02:16:08,120
God.

1850
02:16:14,940 --> 02:16:15,900
Got it.

1851
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:28,880
I guess I need to go up there, so we go here, and...

1852
02:16:33,300 --> 02:16:34,840
How do I get over... Oh!

1853
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:36,640
So scary when it's dark!

1854
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,620
Mito's so smart.

1855
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:44,800
I'm overthinking it?

1856
02:16:44,860 --> 02:16:45,540
Am I for real?

1857
02:16:46,420 --> 02:16:47,580
Oh, I think I am.

1858
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:50,840
Wait, am I?

1859
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,540
How do I get up there, though?

1860
02:16:55,620 --> 02:16:57,300
Now I overthink, of course.

1861
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:04,930
I wish that it wasn't so dark.

1862
02:17:08,170 --> 02:17:09,810
I also don't know where...

1863
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:12,130
I feel... That's where I need to go, no?

1864
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:17,900
This is just a secret.

1865
02:17:18,260 --> 02:17:18,720
Oh, really?

1866
02:17:19,380 --> 02:17:19,640
Oh.

1867
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:21,900
This isn't where I need to go?

1868
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:27,360
Oh, I just did- did it on- Oh!

1869
02:17:38,530 --> 02:17:41,870
The platforms could use more yellow.

1870
02:17:45,590 --> 02:17:46,730
Better and better.

1871
02:17:47,850 --> 02:17:49,570
I am Father Gregory.

1872
02:17:50,390 --> 02:17:53,470
You have already met my congregation.

1873
02:18:01,710 --> 02:18:03,750
Very funny, mister.

1874
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:08,730
Are you in here, or...

1875
02:18:13,080 --> 02:18:13,700
Oh.

1876
02:18:17,480 --> 02:18:19,180
Oh, come on.

1877
02:18:23,340 --> 02:18:25,660
Oh, I knew that was gonna happen.

1878
02:18:27,720 --> 02:18:29,080
We're fine.

1879
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:32,620
Or it's dead, right?

1880
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,660
I could have used your help like two seconds ago.

1881
02:18:43,600 --> 02:18:43,740
Ah!

1882
02:18:44,360 --> 02:18:46,120
How is he so fast?

1883
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:48,340
Oh!

1884
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:51,200
It is you, brother.

1885
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:52,180
I apologize.

1886
02:18:57,440 --> 02:18:58,620
I'm stuck on the door.

1887
02:18:58,780 --> 02:18:59,820
I'm stuck on the...

1888
02:18:59,820 --> 02:19:00,080
Head grab!

1889
02:19:01,900 --> 02:19:03,520
Oh my gosh, please.

1890
02:19:07,290 --> 02:19:08,770
I wish I could pick them up.

1891
02:19:09,430 --> 02:19:10,450
Door's stuck!

1892
02:19:11,090 --> 02:19:12,890
Please, Mr. Help me!

1893
02:19:13,530 --> 02:19:13,770
Oh.

1894
02:19:14,870 --> 02:19:16,230
Oh, this is so funny.

1895
02:19:17,170 --> 02:19:19,090
It like reloads the thing.

1896
02:19:28,690 --> 02:19:30,330
We didn't have gamer paint.

1897
02:19:30,610 --> 02:19:32,070
We had to walk uphill to Ravenholm.

1898
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:33,230
Both ways.

1899
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:33,910
Okay, run.

1900
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:43,000
Wish I could see anything.

1901
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:46,560
Oh gosh, I hear him.

1902
02:19:50,380 --> 02:19:51,680
Yeah, don't come at me.

1903
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:01,670
Oh, ew, nasty.

1904
02:20:02,230 --> 02:20:03,050
That thing's huge.

1905
02:20:05,390 --> 02:20:06,370
Where'd the others?

1906
02:20:07,110 --> 02:20:07,970
Oh, that's a gun.

1907
02:20:16,230 --> 02:20:17,690
Oh, it's just two of them.

1908
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,670
Ah!

1909
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:27,390
You're not supposed to jump at me while you're on fire.

1910
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:31,290
Does it not burn?

1911
02:20:36,310 --> 02:20:37,490
Just chilling.

1912
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:40,590
Oh, there he goes.

1913
02:20:41,710 --> 02:20:42,430
About time.

1914
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:46,590
I have nothing else to throw.

1915
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:48,290
I have a paint can.

1916
02:20:49,250 --> 02:20:49,890
And a dream.

1917
02:20:54,890 --> 02:20:57,050
Oh, I lost my paint can!

1918
02:21:01,390 --> 02:21:03,010
Have a chair?

1919
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:10,890
Please, Mr. Oh, my God, I lost it.

1920
02:21:12,010 --> 02:21:12,090
Ah!

1921
02:21:12,730 --> 02:21:13,530
Wait, it's in your block!

1922
02:21:17,470 --> 02:21:18,630
What just happened?

1923
02:21:23,740 --> 02:21:24,900
Wait, what just happened?

1924
02:21:30,340 --> 02:21:31,300
There we go.

1925
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:36,490
Explosive chair?

1926
02:21:37,130 --> 02:21:37,970
For real, though.

1927
02:21:43,070 --> 02:21:43,970
Was it because I parried?

1928
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:45,830
Whatever you threw at me?

1929
02:21:53,580 --> 02:21:56,080
Maybe I should just go down.

1930
02:21:59,300 --> 02:21:59,940
Will they fall?

1931
02:22:02,120 --> 02:22:02,840
No.

1932
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:07,890
Ah!

1933
02:22:21,220 --> 02:22:22,880
Yeah, boy!

1934
02:22:24,740 --> 02:22:25,600
So true.

1935
02:22:31,150 --> 02:22:31,930
So, how?

1936
02:22:33,030 --> 02:22:39,950
I don't quite understand why it exploded, but it worked, I suppose.

1937
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:42,810
Longest, yeah, boy!

1938
02:22:44,430 --> 02:22:45,990
Over here?

1939
02:22:46,830 --> 02:22:47,210
No.

1940
02:22:54,930 --> 02:22:55,270
Oh.

1941
02:22:56,070 --> 02:22:57,010
Nice, lucky.

1942
02:22:58,430 --> 02:23:00,370
We take what we take.

1943
02:23:03,510 --> 02:23:05,410
I think there's a cheeky little ladder.

1944
02:23:05,650 --> 02:23:06,630
There's a ladder somewhere?

1945
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:10,850
Or...

1946
02:23:10,850 --> 02:23:11,450
Do I...

1947
02:23:11,450 --> 02:23:12,670
Do I need to get on to...

1948
02:23:12,670 --> 02:23:13,610
Oh, I think I do.

1949
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:14,050
Okay.

1950
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:18,550
I do need to maybe get back up there somehow.

1951
02:23:20,690 --> 02:23:22,030
It's a big ladder?

1952
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:23,190
Did I miss it?

1953
02:23:23,330 --> 02:23:24,470
I mean, clearly I did.

1954
02:23:27,190 --> 02:23:28,070
Actually, I did.

1955
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:44,720
Honestly, it would have been way better to get down here before because they are not as ganged up right now.

1956
02:23:46,240 --> 02:23:46,480
Oops!

1957
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:49,700
That's not what I meant to do.

1958
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,060
Yeah!

1959
02:23:55,820 --> 02:23:56,260
Boy!

1960
02:23:59,560 --> 02:24:01,400
I lost it.

1961
02:24:04,950 --> 02:24:05,450
Yeah!

1962
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:09,270
Booy!

1963
02:24:10,770 --> 02:24:11,090
Oh!

1964
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:15,470
Is he on fire now?

1965
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:18,310
Oh, is this him?

1966
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:23,290
All right, where's the ladder at?

1967
02:24:30,850 --> 02:24:33,170
The brick is the best.

1968
02:24:33,410 --> 02:24:34,090
It's not big.

1969
02:24:35,630 --> 02:24:39,010
It's effective ladder.

1970
02:24:45,630 --> 02:24:47,830
What do you mean, but...

1971
02:24:48,390 --> 02:24:49,370
Why would I be...

1972
02:24:49,370 --> 02:24:50,530
Why would I be...

1973
02:24:51,150 --> 02:24:53,570
Kidding with you guys here?

1974
02:24:56,210 --> 02:24:57,870
The glasses aren't working!

1975
02:24:59,850 --> 02:25:00,510
Where did it?

1976
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:02,010
Where is it?

1977
02:25:02,150 --> 02:25:03,130
Where is it?

1978
02:25:08,640 --> 02:25:09,980
Down the hill.

1979
02:25:11,760 --> 02:25:13,900
Wait, can I...

1980
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:15,220
Never mind.

1981
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:19,340
I thought there was something maybe over here.

1982
02:25:21,740 --> 02:25:22,140
Uh...

1983
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:23,840
No, that's not it.

1984
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:37,120
I see it.

1985
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:45,840
Okay, but you guys can't be like, man, but I wasn't even in the right area.

1986
02:25:46,060 --> 02:25:48,960
Of course I'm not gonna see it if I'm not in the correct spot.

1987
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:51,200
Like, that'd be craziness, no?

1988
02:25:51,760 --> 02:25:52,160
Yeah.

1989
02:25:54,700 --> 02:25:56,460
I wasn't even in the rider.

1990
02:25:56,760 --> 02:25:58,060
Oh, no, they call me crazy.

1991
02:25:58,340 --> 02:26:00,520
I care much, for thou art my helper.

1992
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,420
My strength and my strength.

1993
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:05,480
Ah, good.

1994
02:26:12,740 --> 02:26:14,420
I need the gamer pant.

1995
02:26:15,480 --> 02:26:16,840
It's literally made for me.

1996
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:18,800
Oh, whoops.

1997
02:26:24,740 --> 02:26:25,100
Oh.

1998
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:28,660
This little piggy.

1999
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:33,030
Okay, I think they're all dead.

2000
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:40,460
This Goldilocks up in here.

2001
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:42,080
For real.

2002
02:26:46,810 --> 02:26:47,130
Whoa!

2003
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:50,210
Oh, gosh.

2004
02:26:55,710 --> 02:26:58,030
Um, I lost the saw.

2005
02:26:59,390 --> 02:27:02,310
But we still have...

2006
02:27:02,310 --> 02:27:03,750
Cinder block?

2007
02:27:05,070 --> 02:27:05,690
Cinder block.

2008
02:27:06,390 --> 02:27:07,730
Uh, we don't...

2009
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:23,890
have the cinder block anymore either there was one in here she looks so scientific it's on the stairs what the hell mister

2010
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:30,640
oh there it is

2011
02:27:33,960 --> 02:27:35,060
don't grab me

2012
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:48,370
oh there it is it was not on the stairs Unless you were talking about the cinder block.

2013
02:27:49,510 --> 02:27:50,610
Then you're correct.

2014
02:27:53,010 --> 02:27:53,370
Oh.

2015
02:27:57,950 --> 02:27:58,530
Uh-oh.

2016
02:27:58,670 --> 02:27:59,910
That's a whole lot of health.

2017
02:28:00,910 --> 02:28:02,150
A whole lot of items.

2018
02:28:03,490 --> 02:28:05,970
Van, thank you so much for the peek.

2019
02:28:06,310 --> 02:28:06,730
Thank you.

2020
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:10,990
That's a lot of stuff.

2021
02:28:13,970 --> 02:28:15,790
What do you mean it's time, lads?

2022
02:28:15,890 --> 02:28:16,690
What do you mean?

2023
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:19,370
Please

2024
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:31,640
come back

2025
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:38,960
They looked like Spider-Man

2026
02:28:45,170 --> 02:29:04,430
That's me That's me Use guns now Ow Okay I'll use guns No Spider-Man's a good guy Which gun should we use?

2027
02:29:05,850 --> 02:29:06,430
This one?

2028
02:29:09,010 --> 02:29:12,310
I guess I already missed the achievement, so...

2029
02:29:12,310 --> 02:29:14,450
No, but look at all of these!

2030
02:29:16,110 --> 02:29:18,070
That I can't use.

2031
02:29:18,830 --> 02:29:22,630
What's the point of having so many washing machines if they are not for...

2032
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:24,610
Picking up and throwing?

2033
02:29:32,230 --> 02:29:33,850
Gosh, they take a lot of hits, though.

2034
02:29:35,410 --> 02:29:36,830
It's gonna turn down.

2035
02:29:42,890 --> 02:29:45,330
Or I could just one shot him with a saw.

2036
02:29:49,580 --> 02:29:51,200
Too heavy since when?

2037
02:30:19,340 --> 02:30:22,100
What's all this ammo that I'm trying to pick up but I...

2038
02:30:24,300 --> 02:30:24,820
I...

2039
02:30:24,820 --> 02:30:26,300
I guess maybe this?

2040
02:30:26,620 --> 02:30:27,140
My pistol?

2041
02:30:32,020 --> 02:30:33,640
Pistol and revolver?

2042
02:30:35,220 --> 02:30:36,720
Revolver I can only hold 12?

2043
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:42,000
I like this because I can just kind of blast them.

2044
02:30:43,240 --> 02:30:43,540
You know?

2045
02:30:48,160 --> 02:30:49,080
It's pretty easy.

2046
02:31:00,060 --> 02:31:01,320
Let's grab this real quick.

2047
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:04,160
Why not?

2048
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:05,080
Wait.

2049
02:31:05,380 --> 02:31:06,440
Is there anything behind here?

2050
02:31:11,020 --> 02:31:11,820
Any secrets?

2051
02:31:13,260 --> 02:31:13,880
It's in your cart?

2052
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:14,600
What if you...

2053
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:15,200
What if there was a little secret?

2054
02:31:15,220 --> 02:31:16,300
snake in there.

2055
02:31:17,260 --> 02:31:18,440
Just a box, actually.

2056
02:31:19,900 --> 02:31:21,540
For once, just a box.

2057
02:31:24,200 --> 02:31:25,400
Now we'll go with the pistol.

2058
02:31:31,080 --> 02:31:32,560
He isn't enjoying himself.

2059
02:31:34,580 --> 02:31:34,660
Oh.

2060
02:31:44,300 --> 02:31:45,420
Is he gonna help me?

2061
02:31:45,540 --> 02:31:46,460
Are we gonna fight together?

2062
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:47,220
Hi, it's me!

2063
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:50,400
Come closer.

2064
02:31:50,900 --> 02:31:51,320
I'm here.

2065
02:31:51,720 --> 02:31:53,240
You've stirred up hell.

2066
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:55,840
Man after my own heart.

2067
02:31:55,960 --> 02:31:56,360
Hey!

2068
02:31:57,140 --> 02:31:57,800
What was that?

2069
02:31:59,160 --> 02:32:00,160
You'll need it.

2070
02:32:00,700 --> 02:32:00,980
Catch.

2071
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:02,600
Good.

2072
02:32:03,180 --> 02:32:04,680
Now, keep it close.

2073
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:05,440
What is this?

2074
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,160
Oh, sorry.

2075
02:32:07,080 --> 02:32:08,140
Aim for the head.

2076
02:32:09,180 --> 02:32:09,620
Hush.

2077
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:11,600
They come.

2078
02:32:12,500 --> 02:32:12,980
There is.

2079
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:13,200
Aim for the head.

2080
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:14,160
There is no rest in Ravenhorn.

2081
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,600
Move on and I will meet you at the church.

2082
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:18,500
Okay.

2083
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:19,460
Okay.

2084
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:22,880
Oh my gosh.

2085
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:49,160
Where is it?

2086
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:51,420
Jesus!

2087
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:54,840
I'm gonna die to a head grab!

2088
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:16,750
I...

2089
02:33:16,750 --> 02:33:18,630
I lost everything!

2090
02:33:19,910 --> 02:33:23,740
What did we...

2091
02:33:23,820 --> 02:33:24,400
What did we get?

2092
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:25,540
What did he give us?

2093
02:33:26,960 --> 02:33:30,180
Well, I don't have any ammo for it, so nothing, I suppose.

2094
02:33:32,200 --> 02:33:35,140
Do I have to go all the way back to...

2095
02:33:36,020 --> 02:33:37,680
Where the hell did you guys come from?

2096
02:33:39,320 --> 02:33:40,460
Where did you come from?

2097
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:43,320
I'm not having you sneak up on me.

2098
02:33:45,260 --> 02:33:46,200
It was four?

2099
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:48,540
Oh, it won't let me select it then.

2100
02:33:52,820 --> 02:33:53,620
Probably because...

2101
02:33:54,140 --> 02:33:54,620
Okay.

2102
02:33:57,700 --> 02:33:58,860
Probably because I have no ammo.

2103
02:34:01,940 --> 02:34:05,540
Let's just see how far we can get.

2104
02:34:10,380 --> 02:34:13,360
I don't remember when I last loaded, I'll be honest.

2105
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,780
Is there any health back here, maybe?

2106
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:31,060
Play them all, or will you summarize?

2107
02:34:32,600 --> 02:34:33,820
summarize metal gear.

2108
02:34:34,840 --> 02:34:36,400
You're just gonna have to play all of them.

2109
02:34:47,660 --> 02:34:48,920
Oh my god.

2110
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:56,750
Because I wouldn't have me.

2111
02:34:57,970 --> 02:34:58,770
Oh, there's some.

2112
02:34:58,970 --> 02:34:59,930
Okay, so four.

2113
02:35:00,570 --> 02:35:01,390
Was the shoddy.

2114
02:35:02,650 --> 02:35:07,950
I wouldn't have me fall because that, obviously, we saw what happened to me.

2115
02:35:11,740 --> 02:35:14,700
I guess maybe I go down and around over there.

2116
02:35:16,020 --> 02:35:17,140
Oh, there's so many down there.

2117
02:35:22,220 --> 02:35:24,300
Hold on, I'm just getting my bearings.

2118
02:35:28,460 --> 02:35:28,720
Okay.

2119
02:35:29,280 --> 02:35:30,560
Maybe I was supposed to go down.

2120
02:35:30,720 --> 02:35:32,260
I just, you know, messed it up.

2121
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:33,920
Jump on the water tank?

2122
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:35,500
Can I make that?

2123
02:35:36,280 --> 02:35:37,460
Oh, I see.

2124
02:35:37,880 --> 02:35:38,240
Okay.

2125
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:39,700
Ah, I see.

2126
02:35:39,940 --> 02:35:40,160
Okay.

2127
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:43,940
There's nothing in here, right?

2128
02:35:45,880 --> 02:35:46,320
Oh.

2129
02:35:48,080 --> 02:35:50,160
Oh gosh, that scared me!

2130
02:35:55,410 --> 02:35:57,850
Oh, the game new!

2131
02:35:58,050 --> 02:35:58,990
The game new!

2132
02:36:17,480 --> 02:36:17,900
Holy!

2133
02:36:21,960 --> 02:36:23,140
I hear him climbing.

2134
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:42,320
I think I'm gonna save.

2135
02:36:42,980 --> 02:36:46,320
It might be a mistake, but I think it might be fine too.

2136
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:47,240
Who knows?

2137
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:48,680
Wait, there's supplies in here!

2138
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:49,900
Okay, maybe it's fine.

2139
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:54,020
Oh, that's not supplies.

2140
02:36:56,580 --> 02:36:59,900
And there's gravity gun things, supplies in here.

2141
02:37:08,720 --> 02:37:09,700
I'm ready.

2142
02:37:09,960 --> 02:37:10,440
I'm ready.

2143
02:37:10,800 --> 02:37:12,260
I'm ready for whoever's in there.

2144
02:37:18,700 --> 02:37:19,720
Oh my gosh.

2145
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:23,020
Oh my gosh.

2146
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:23,840
No.

2147
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:30,000
Where?

2148
02:37:30,140 --> 02:37:30,580
There it is.

2149
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:32,860
Oh, you're fine.

2150
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:36,660
Close the door.

2151
02:37:36,920 --> 02:37:38,200
Good plan.

2152
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:40,160
Oh, there was nobody in there.

2153
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,380
I didn't lose that much health, so...

2154
02:37:44,380 --> 02:37:45,140
Oh, wrong.

2155
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:46,240
Wait, there it is.

2156
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,180
Okay.

2157
02:38:00,550 --> 02:38:01,630
Oh no!

2158
02:38:02,830 --> 02:38:03,330
Oh no!

2159
02:38:06,590 --> 02:38:08,310
Mouse 2 with shotgun fires double shots.

2160
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:11,150
Okay, I did accidentally shoot double shots earlier.

2161
02:38:12,150 --> 02:38:13,230
So, um...

2162
02:38:13,590 --> 02:38:14,030
Uh-oh.

2163
02:38:14,630 --> 02:38:16,170
What the hell is that?

2164
02:38:17,010 --> 02:38:18,010
Well, he's on fire.

2165
02:38:19,350 --> 02:38:19,830
Oh my gosh.

2166
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:22,770
I don't have any more shot than bullets?

2167
02:38:28,540 --> 02:38:29,560
They're fast.

2168
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:30,540
Oh, geez.

2169
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:36,680
The game knows.

2170
02:38:45,650 --> 02:38:45,830
Okay.

2171
02:38:48,310 --> 02:38:48,890
Okay.

2172
02:38:49,530 --> 02:38:49,730
Okay.

2173
02:38:54,410 --> 02:38:56,150
I don't like it.

2174
02:38:56,230 --> 02:38:57,270
I don't like it.

2175
02:38:58,950 --> 02:38:59,890
I don't like it.

2176
02:38:59,910 --> 02:39:00,670
I like it.

2177
02:39:02,550 --> 02:39:03,190
Okay, okay.

2178
02:39:03,550 --> 02:39:04,250
All right, we're fine.

2179
02:39:05,610 --> 02:39:05,890
Maybe.

2180
02:39:07,150 --> 02:39:08,470
I need to stop saying that, huh?

2181
02:39:11,230 --> 02:39:13,070
I see this, by the way.

2182
02:39:13,210 --> 02:39:13,790
Don't worry.

2183
02:39:14,010 --> 02:39:15,130
I do see it.

2184
02:39:15,410 --> 02:39:17,050
Oh, that was that guy dying, maybe.

2185
02:39:18,030 --> 02:39:18,430
Okay.

2186
02:39:20,190 --> 02:39:20,630
Okay.

2187
02:39:22,490 --> 02:39:23,890
Oh, and this is a dead end.

2188
02:39:24,050 --> 02:39:24,250
Okay.

2189
02:39:25,990 --> 02:39:26,390
Woo!

2190
02:39:34,520 --> 02:39:35,580
You can see.

2191
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:36,640
Squirm.

2192
02:39:38,500 --> 02:39:39,760
I'm just gonna get it preemptively.

2193
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:46,960
I pressed four earlier, you guys.

2194
02:39:48,540 --> 02:39:50,140
And it would not...

2195
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:51,600
It would not equip it.

2196
02:39:51,660 --> 02:39:52,680
That's so weird.

2197
02:39:53,020 --> 02:39:54,660
But now when I press it, it does.

2198
02:39:55,460 --> 02:39:55,880
Huh.

2199
02:39:56,940 --> 02:39:57,800
That's weird.

2200
02:39:58,520 --> 02:39:59,520
The gun was empty.

2201
02:39:59,860 --> 02:40:02,740
But I didn't just pick up bullets.

2202
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:04,860
Because I had no ammo.

2203
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:06,320
When did I just pick up ammo?

2204
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:07,460
I didn't.

2205
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:10,740
No, I mean like just now.

2206
02:40:16,820 --> 02:40:17,900
You know what they're like?

2207
02:40:20,040 --> 02:40:22,180
They are like the...

2208
02:40:22,780 --> 02:40:24,000
Oh my gosh.

2209
02:40:26,520 --> 02:40:28,020
They're like the um...

2210
02:40:28,980 --> 02:40:30,940
The cows in MGS4.

2211
02:40:44,780 --> 02:40:46,180
Who's throwing that?

2212
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:47,780
Oh my gosh.

2213
02:40:51,440 --> 02:40:53,260
Who's throwing all this?

2214
02:41:02,670 --> 02:41:03,710
I'm waiting.

2215
02:41:04,950 --> 02:41:05,390
Tactical.

2216
02:41:07,550 --> 02:41:09,630
They're not coming until I go, are they?

2217
02:41:10,470 --> 02:41:10,830
Okay.

2218
02:41:11,550 --> 02:41:12,530
I get it.

2219
02:41:12,990 --> 02:41:13,510
I understand.

2220
02:41:13,870 --> 02:41:14,410
I saw them.

2221
02:41:14,770 --> 02:41:16,670
Oh, they're over there, aren't they?

2222
02:41:33,920 --> 02:41:35,780
Yeah, maybe I'll just bring it with me.

2223
02:41:40,420 --> 02:41:41,740
There's some up there, too.

2224
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:46,760

Look at them go.

2227
02:42:26,400 --> 02:42:28,420
They're just pushing around everything.

2228
02:42:29,100 --> 02:42:35,480
I don't like it.

2229
02:42:42,540 --> 02:42:44,080
Oh, they come from here too!

2230
02:42:46,900 --> 02:42:50,220
Where'd the other things go?

2231
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:14,150
Not even two shots?

2232
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:15,410
Get some?

2233
02:43:20,540 --> 02:43:21,300
Ouch.

2234
02:43:21,580 --> 02:43:37,790
I'll try to switch between the two so I don't just waste you know we're jukein' them we're jukein them

2236

Okay, and oh, more of them, but so many.

2237
02:44:10,190 --> 02:44:11,930
Oh, oops, I thought I changed.

2238
02:44:12,690 --> 02:44:13,530
I did press G.

2239
02:44:22,070 --> 02:44:25,070
Whoa, whoa, where'd he go?

2240
02:44:28,430 --> 02:44:29,130
Killed him, though.

2241
02:44:30,170 --> 02:44:31,030
I got his butt.

2242
02:44:32,570 --> 02:44:32,870
Ah!

2243
02:44:34,350 --> 02:44:36,530
I wish these guys dropped stuff.

2244
02:44:37,710 --> 02:44:39,570
so used to, what's it called right now?

2245
02:44:40,370 --> 02:44:41,250
Resident Evil.

2246
02:44:44,630 --> 02:44:45,830
It's never ending.

2247
02:44:51,160 --> 02:44:52,060
Um, I know what I'm gonna do.

2248
02:45:08,880 --> 02:45:11,020
Oh my gosh, there's so many of you guys!

2249
02:45:11,460 --> 02:45:11,900
Ah!

2250
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:13,880
He was too close to me!

2251
02:45:14,240 --> 02:45:14,600
Oh!

2252
02:45:17,940 --> 02:45:19,120
Oh my gosh.

2253
02:45:20,100 --> 02:45:21,880
Do I just need to go through this area?

2254
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:23,080
Oh wait.

2255
02:45:26,260 --> 02:45:26,820
Yippee!

2256
02:45:27,640 --> 02:45:29,320
Oh my gosh, they really are never ending!

2257
02:45:45,770 --> 02:45:47,530
Where'd it go?

2258
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:02,940
Oops.

2259
02:46:03,920 --> 02:46:04,320
I missed.

2260
02:46:04,640 --> 02:46:06,820
I, uh...

2261
02:46:08,920 --> 02:46:10,040
Come here.

2262
02:46:13,890 --> 02:46:14,070
Ah!

2263
02:46:16,270 --> 02:46:17,850
I'm so bad right now.

2264
02:46:18,150 --> 02:46:18,910
I'm so angry.

2265
02:46:20,590 --> 02:46:21,570
I'm so angry!

2266
02:46:29,300 --> 02:46:30,260
Gamer rage.

2267
02:46:30,500 --> 02:46:32,240
I'm never, I'm always too far.

2268
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:33,640
I'm always too close.

2269
02:46:35,100 --> 02:46:36,820
It's never, it's never in between.

2270
02:46:37,740 --> 02:46:39,260
It's never, I can never read it.

2271
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:40,660
I can never read it well.

2272
02:46:49,260 --> 02:46:51,820
Yabba-dabba-dabba.

2273
02:46:56,920 --> 02:46:58,680
Is this all contraption?

2274
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:01,200
Right now, I'm just trying to survive, man.

2275
02:47:01,680 --> 02:47:03,200
I'm just trying to...

2276
02:47:15,650 --> 02:47:17,270
I'm just trying to survive!

2277
02:47:18,610 --> 02:47:20,430
There was a lever up there, was there?

2278
02:47:20,590 --> 02:47:21,390
Oh, thank you.

2279
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:27,190
So I was right about a contraption happening.

2280
02:47:28,530 --> 02:47:28,870
Lever.

2281
02:47:35,630 --> 02:47:36,950
I don't see it.

2282
02:47:46,170 --> 02:47:47,190
On the balcony?

2283
02:47:47,750 --> 02:47:48,250
Which one?

2284
02:47:56,480 --> 02:47:59,440
I was looking for something on the wall, okay?

2285
02:48:00,780 --> 02:48:02,240
Not on the ground.

2286
02:48:06,730 --> 02:48:07,930
Why am I on this gun?

2287
02:48:08,670 --> 02:48:10,430
Oh, I don't have any shotgun stuff left.

2288
02:48:11,550 --> 02:48:12,550
All right, we're revolving.

2289
02:48:17,500 --> 02:48:19,680
It's not as good as I would wish it to be.

2290
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:20,220
All right.

2291
02:48:21,060 --> 02:48:21,780
Take two.

2292
02:48:23,400 --> 02:48:23,920
I...

2293
02:48:23,920 --> 02:48:26,340
Okay, but that one was my fault.

2294
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:30,620
So that led over there, okay.

2295
02:48:31,920 --> 02:48:34,000
I think we need one more.

2296
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:36,240
Wow, they really just don't stop coming.

2297
02:48:41,390 --> 02:48:42,810
I'm just looking around.

2298
02:48:52,280 --> 02:48:54,980
Oh, please, you guys!

2299
02:48:57,680 --> 02:48:58,020
Oh!

2300
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:04,180
Somewhere?

2301
02:49:07,520 --> 02:49:08,880
Ah-ha!

2302
02:49:12,850 --> 02:49:13,330
Okay, okay.

2303
02:49:13,650 --> 02:49:15,430
I knew that was going to open at some point.

2304
02:49:15,710 --> 02:49:15,990
How...

2305
02:49:15,990 --> 02:49:16,850
There was...

2306
02:49:18,990 --> 02:49:19,550
Um...

2307
02:49:19,550 --> 02:49:22,410
I thought there was one more spot I hadn't gone inside.

2308
02:49:23,750 --> 02:49:24,110
There?

2309
02:49:26,450 --> 02:49:27,010
Yes.

2310
02:49:27,930 --> 02:49:28,490
No.

2311
02:49:30,830 --> 02:49:31,390
Uh...

2312
02:49:32,670 --> 02:49:33,670
Oh, my gosh.

2313
02:49:37,170 --> 02:49:38,710
You can shoot Oreo barrels.

2314
02:49:39,350 --> 02:49:42,150
I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.

2315
02:49:42,950 --> 02:49:43,510
Okay.

2316
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:45,970
I can't tell.

2317
02:49:47,110 --> 02:49:50,030
I feel a little trapped.

2318
02:49:53,360 --> 02:49:56,540
I think they're endless, and that's why I'm not even bothering with them anymore.

2319
02:50:08,670 --> 02:50:12,290
If I go back up here, there was nothing.

2320
02:50:14,370 --> 02:50:15,430
How do I get up?

2321
02:50:16,430 --> 02:50:18,630
Me and ladders, my greatest nemesis.

2322
02:50:21,850 --> 02:50:23,270
Me finding ladders.

2323
02:50:23,990 --> 02:50:25,110
Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2324
02:50:26,130 --> 02:50:26,430
Wait.

2325
02:50:26,990 --> 02:50:27,990
Oh my gosh.

2326
02:50:30,090 --> 02:50:31,390
This part's so evil.

2327
02:50:32,010 --> 02:50:33,150
Okay, no ladder there.

2328
02:50:39,130 --> 02:50:42,230
I kind of want to restart it, but we've already gotten this far.

2329
02:50:42,930 --> 02:50:46,150
Because I didn't realize that they were endless, so...

2330
02:50:48,130 --> 02:50:49,170
Head north.

2331
02:50:49,410 --> 02:50:49,690
Okay.

2332
02:50:53,210 --> 02:50:54,810
Oh, they're all gone now.

2333
02:50:56,530 --> 02:50:58,530
I think they all just follow each other.

2334
02:50:59,070 --> 02:51:02,070
I wish I could just climb up that guy.

2335
02:51:13,770 --> 02:51:14,270
Oh my god.

2336
02:51:14,650 --> 02:51:15,670
Oh my god.

2337
02:51:17,930 --> 02:51:19,790
Do I have one HP?

2338
02:51:23,010 --> 02:51:26,490
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose it.

2339
02:51:28,870 --> 02:51:31,130
Oh my gosh, please.

2340
02:51:46,680 --> 02:51:48,600
Oh, there's so many of them!

2341
02:51:49,760 --> 02:51:50,960
I hate this!

2342
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:51,680
I hate this!

2343
02:51:51,860 --> 02:51:52,560
I hate this!

2344
02:51:57,880 --> 02:51:59,020
Oh, screw!

2345
02:51:59,480 --> 02:52:01,200
Screw this whole section.

2346
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:02,300
Ah!

2347
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:03,300
It's a dead end!

2348
02:52:07,760 --> 02:52:08,020
What?

2349
02:52:08,280 --> 02:52:08,660
What was-

2350
02:52:15,080 --> 02:52:15,600
Climb?

2351
02:52:15,820 --> 02:52:16,060
Where?

2352
02:52:18,780 --> 02:52:19,300
This?

2353
02:52:19,540 --> 02:52:19,980
Where?

2354
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:21,800
I saw a ladder right there.

2355
02:52:21,980 --> 02:52:22,660
Oh wait, Elman.

2356
02:52:23,500 --> 02:52:24,060
Oh my god.

2357
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,720
This is it, boys.

2358
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:33,340
Oh, I see it now.

2359
02:52:38,370 --> 02:52:39,470
Oh, I see it.

2360
02:52:39,650 --> 02:52:40,670
I see it.

2361
02:52:41,310 --> 02:52:45,650
Oh, this part is so evil.

2362
02:52:46,190 --> 02:52:46,970
Oh, it's so evil.

2363
02:52:49,530 --> 02:52:51,750
Oh, I didn't hate the game until now.

2364
02:52:51,970 --> 02:52:53,050
I didn't hate the game until now.

2365
02:52:53,210 --> 02:52:54,350
I didn't hate the game until now.

2366
02:52:55,230 --> 02:52:56,730
I didn't hate

2367
02:53:00,690 --> 02:53:01,890
the game until now.

2368
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:31,640

i can't tell

2370
02:53:55,380 --> 02:53:58,360
Okay, anyway, um...

2371
02:54:06,520 --> 02:54:11,260
If they didn't want you to use the quick save, they wouldn't give it to you.

2372
02:54:16,360 --> 02:54:17,420
That's right.

2373
02:54:18,020 --> 02:54:18,880
That's right.

2374
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:21,740
That's right!

2375
02:54:23,300 --> 02:54:24,620
How are you still alive?

2376
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:25,780
Oh!

2377
02:54:30,840 --> 02:54:31,800
Quick save.

2378
02:54:32,360 --> 02:54:35,480
I picked

2379
02:54:39,060 --> 02:54:39,600
up something.

2380
02:54:40,460 --> 02:54:42,080
Yes, give me more ammo.

2381
02:54:44,240 --> 02:54:45,120
Oh my god.

2382
02:54:45,600 --> 02:54:46,970
Where are you?

2383
02:54:48,780 --> 02:54:49,560
Did he miss?

2384
02:54:49,980 --> 02:54:50,160
Ow!

2385
02:54:55,550 --> 02:54:56,370
I'm going!

2386
02:55:00,450 --> 02:55:01,250
Who's shooting?

2387
02:55:10,620 --> 02:55:12,060
Oh, here they are.

2388
02:55:13,100 --> 02:55:14,540
Oh, I should be...

2389
02:55:14,540 --> 02:55:16,740
Okay, I understand what I was supposed to do.

2390
02:55:17,680 --> 02:55:19,440
Like, I should have taken that and...

2391
02:55:20,120 --> 02:55:21,900
Okay, I'm just...

2392
02:55:23,020 --> 02:55:25,460
Please help me, father!

2393
02:55:25,820 --> 02:55:27,160
How came you here, brother?

2394
02:55:27,400 --> 02:55:30,140
This is the wrong side of town for you.

2395
02:55:31,020 --> 02:55:31,460
Oh.

2396
02:55:42,120 --> 02:55:42,900
Oops.

2397
02:55:48,340 --> 02:55:48,720
Nice one.

2398
02:55:48,960 --> 02:55:49,600
Bye!

2399
02:55:51,140 --> 02:55:52,360
Oh, shoot.

2400
02:55:53,120 --> 02:55:53,520
Oh.

2401
02:55:55,160 --> 02:55:55,500
Oh.

2402
02:55:55,520 --> 02:56:27,600

2403
02:56:39,070 --> 02:56:40,950
We reached a new checkpoint.

2404
02:56:43,150 --> 02:56:43,630
Hallelujah.

2405
02:56:45,250 --> 02:56:47,670
I'm feeling the holiness of this church.

2406
02:56:49,050 --> 02:56:50,410
That's like...

2407
02:56:50,410 --> 02:56:50,650
Ow!

2408
02:56:50,990 --> 02:56:51,390
Golly.

2409
02:56:54,150 --> 02:56:54,890
What is that?

2410
02:56:55,230 --> 02:56:56,250
This is special looking.

2411
02:57:00,190 --> 02:57:00,870
Nothing.

2412
02:57:05,210 --> 02:57:12,130
You know, I should have remembered how the good old-fashioned way of taking care of a head crab is just smacking it.

2413
02:57:15,030 --> 02:57:16,110
Just smacking it.

2414
02:57:16,210 --> 02:57:18,650
Oh, I gotta take out my aggressions real quick.

2415
02:57:20,890 --> 02:57:22,390
Are those not goods for me?

2416
02:57:23,410 --> 02:57:25,210
Oh, there are things to throw, I suppose.

2417
02:57:26,110 --> 02:57:26,410
What the?

2418
02:57:26,870 --> 02:57:28,430
I got yeeted from the room.

2419
02:57:32,280 --> 02:57:33,980
I don't make me go outside again.

2420
02:57:35,220 --> 02:57:35,780
Downstairs.

2421
02:57:39,360 --> 02:57:39,960
Smackdown.

2422
02:57:40,480 --> 02:57:41,080
Smackdown.

2423
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,400
Not even you can stop the power of the crowbar.

2424
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:05,600
Yeah!

2425
02:58:06,920 --> 02:58:09,920
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2426
02:58:10,080 --> 02:58:11,120
I'm pressing four.

2427
02:58:11,320 --> 02:58:11,960
I guess I'm out.

2428
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:15,480
Woof!

2429
02:58:18,120 --> 02:58:18,640
Crowbar!

2430
02:58:18,900 --> 02:58:19,400
Supremacy!

2431
02:58:21,100 --> 02:58:23,240
Okay, so they both go outside.

2432
02:58:23,700 --> 02:58:24,860
Just one goes...

2433
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:28,460
Ouch!

2434
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:33,160
Holy moly, I took a lot of hit.

2435
02:58:35,800 --> 02:58:38,080
One goes down here and one is upstairs.

2436
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:40,300
Let's check out here first.

2437
02:58:41,940 --> 02:58:42,640
Wait, where am I?

2438
02:58:44,660 --> 02:58:46,840
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

2439
02:58:46,860 --> 02:58:54,680
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, upstairs.

2440
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:04,900
Can I have some more ammo?

2441
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:09,760
Or is that too much to ask?

2442
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:11,020
Oh, gosh.

2443
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:22,920
I'm

2444
02:59:51,270 --> 02:59:54,230
just running anywhere at this point.

2445
02:59:55,910 --> 03:00:02,170
The delayed explosion was mocking me to like the unth degree.

2446
03:00:31,100 --> 03:00:31,760
Anymore?

2447
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:35,660
Where is he?

2448
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:36,200
Oh, no?

2449
03:00:36,980 --> 03:00:37,120
What?

2450
03:00:37,720 --> 03:00:38,500
Oh, there he is.

2451
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:41,080
Oh, my god!

2452
03:00:42,620 --> 03:00:44,580
About 1 HP again!

2453
03:00:45,760 --> 03:00:46,920
Let me up.

2454
03:00:55,330 --> 03:00:57,390
She's not gonna make it!

2455
03:01:02,020 --> 03:01:03,160
I hear I'm running.

2456
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:04,200
Holy cow.

2457
03:01:07,480 --> 03:01:09,080
I'm just gonna run for it.

2458
03:01:11,900 --> 03:01:16,860
health somehow from

2459
03:01:26,870 --> 03:01:51,590

2460
03:01:56,430 --> 03:01:58,170
It's one of these types.

2461
03:02:03,820 --> 03:02:04,980
Oh my gosh, the way it's shaking.

2462
03:02:14,830 --> 03:02:16,750
Keep yourself well stocked, friends.

2463
03:02:24,730 --> 03:02:25,770
There's two of them.

2464
03:02:29,900 --> 03:02:30,420
Maybe?

2465
03:02:32,700 --> 03:02:35,660
I probably don't need to be using two at once, but you know.

2466
03:02:36,320 --> 03:02:36,920
Two of them.

2467
03:02:37,320 --> 03:02:38,100
Here it goes!

2468
03:02:38,440 --> 03:02:39,160
The car!

2469
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:49,680
okay this isn't so bad so far it could be worse it could be way worse is

2470
03:02:54,210 --> 03:02:58,890
it on its way is it the slowest card ever

2471
03:03:12,740 --> 03:03:30,680
um hold on I'm in the cart I saw it for once I'm here I'm here We've made it!

2472
03:03:33,620 --> 03:03:34,880
That wasn't bad at all.

2473
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,660
I thought it was gonna be like an absolute swarm.

2474
03:03:41,960 --> 03:03:43,860
Oh my god, father!

2475
03:03:44,640 --> 03:03:45,060
Greetings, brother.

2476
03:03:45,340 --> 03:03:46,340
Oh, father, father.

2477
03:03:46,340 --> 03:03:47,720
And so we meet at last.

2478
03:03:47,940 --> 03:03:48,300
Father.

2479
03:03:48,540 --> 03:03:51,080
You are to be commended for avoiding my traps.

2480
03:03:51,800 --> 03:03:58,780
The work of a man who once had too much time on his hands and now finds time for nothing but the work of salvation.

2481
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:32,860
wish to remain in raven home so i will show you to the mines i'm so relieved as for me the shepherd must tend to his flock especially when they have grown unruly follow me brother and tread lightly for this is hallowed ground over here brother hold on i'm just exploring a key quickly brother Oh,

2482
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:33,140
okay.

2483
03:04:35,060 --> 03:04:37,840
I can't explore anything at all.

2484
03:04:38,580 --> 03:04:38,800
Oh, okay.

2485
03:04:40,080 --> 03:04:41,140
Beep, beep, beep.

2486
03:04:42,080 --> 03:04:43,060
Hello, brother.

2487
03:04:47,670 --> 03:04:49,430
Oh, why did I fall off?

2488
03:04:49,590 --> 03:04:50,970
I didn't even touch anything.

2489
03:04:51,790 --> 03:04:52,950
Over here, brother.

2490
03:04:55,030 --> 03:04:55,470
Uh-oh.

2491
03:04:59,920 --> 03:05:01,380
I wish I had...

2492
03:05:04,460 --> 03:05:05,400
Oh, my gosh.

2493
03:05:05,860 --> 03:05:06,380
Do I have to protect?

2494
03:05:17,860 --> 03:05:18,460
We're fine.

2495
03:05:22,920 --> 03:05:24,400
He can die?

2496
03:05:24,620 --> 03:05:25,220
No way.

2497
03:05:27,700 --> 03:05:28,220
Escortment.

2498
03:05:28,380 --> 03:05:30,700
Why does he keep pushing me off the low?

2499
03:05:38,630 --> 03:05:41,430
Why am I sniping with a shotgun?

2500
03:05:48,510 --> 03:05:51,330
I don't mind these guys so much, I say.

2501
03:05:52,690 --> 03:05:55,610
I was like...

2502
03:05:55,610 --> 03:05:56,130
Ouch.

2503
03:05:56,450 --> 03:05:56,730
You know what?

2504
03:05:56,770 --> 03:05:57,310
Let's not do that.

2505
03:06:00,500 --> 03:06:02,300
Here I was gonna try and...

2506
03:06:02,400 --> 03:06:04,080
Save my ammo.

2507
03:06:05,280 --> 03:06:10,100
Leave me alone.

2508
03:06:10,500 --> 03:06:11,520
You too.

2509
03:06:22,540 --> 03:06:23,340
Don't worry.

2510
03:06:23,940 --> 03:06:25,120
I actually have a plan.

2511
03:06:30,050 --> 03:06:31,690
This works just as effective.

2512
03:06:41,950 --> 03:06:42,590
Yeah!

2513
03:06:44,550 --> 03:06:46,030
Some good teamwork there.

2514
03:06:46,970 --> 03:06:49,310
Where'd my friend go?

2515
03:06:53,770 --> 03:06:56,430
Where the hell did that thing come from?

2516
03:06:59,570 --> 03:07:00,910
Okay, I hope this works.

2517
03:07:01,850 --> 03:07:04,910
Oh, they're throwing...

2518
03:07:07,310 --> 03:07:09,090
Ah, sorry, brother!

2519
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:13,070
So sorry.

2520
03:07:15,310 --> 03:07:16,330
So sorry, brother.

2521
03:07:16,930 --> 03:07:17,450
So sorry.

2522
03:07:18,370 --> 03:07:20,370
I need to be a little bit careful with those.

2523
03:07:20,450 --> 03:07:21,530
But look, it's all on fire.

2524
03:07:21,650 --> 03:07:22,850
They're all just going to catch on fire.

2525
03:07:23,070 --> 03:07:24,310
It's I made my own trap.

2526
03:07:26,890 --> 03:07:27,230
See?

2527
03:07:28,390 --> 03:07:29,630
They do catch on fire.

2528
03:07:30,730 --> 03:07:31,170
Eventually.

2529
03:07:31,870 --> 03:07:32,510
It works.

2530
03:07:38,530 --> 03:07:39,410
Whoa, today.

2531
03:07:41,650 --> 03:07:42,170
I've put you.

2532
03:07:42,190 --> 03:07:43,210
Get you out of your misery.

2533
03:07:44,470 --> 03:07:45,370
Oh no, our trap!

2534
03:07:47,210 --> 03:07:47,490
Okay.

2535
03:07:47,810 --> 03:07:50,010
Oh, I thought we were leaving?

2536
03:07:50,670 --> 03:07:51,290
Oh, we are leaving.

2537
03:07:51,630 --> 03:07:52,710
Okay, just kidding.

2538
03:07:58,360 --> 03:07:59,560
Can I hurt him?

2539
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:01,440
Or...

2540
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:01,740
May

2541
03:08:06,760 --> 03:08:08,280
the light of lights be with you!

2542
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:11,760
Oh, um, I thought I saw...

2543
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:11,860
Oh.

2544
03:08:15,720 --> 03:08:16,420
Where'd it go?

2545
03:08:18,460 --> 03:08:19,260
Yeah, boy!

2546
03:08:21,840 --> 03:08:22,700
Where'd it go?

2547
03:08:23,720 --> 03:08:24,620
I lose it every time.

2548
03:08:24,780 --> 03:08:27,260
There it is.

2549
03:08:27,380 --> 03:08:27,840
Oh.

2550
03:08:31,040 --> 03:08:31,520
Nice.

2551
03:08:31,660 --> 03:08:33,700
Oh, you're holding out on me, mister.

2552
03:08:38,580 --> 03:08:39,060
Okay.

2553
03:08:40,180 --> 03:08:41,040
Oh, where'd he go?

2554
03:08:41,260 --> 03:08:42,840
Mr. Oh, my friend?

2555
03:08:44,200 --> 03:08:45,860
Hurry while I hold the gate.

2556
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:49,700
Oh, quickly.

2557
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:51,360
Ow!

2558
03:08:51,460 --> 03:08:51,860
Oh my gosh!

2559
03:08:52,040 --> 03:08:52,480
Ah!

2560
03:08:53,160 --> 03:08:53,820
I'm trying!

2561
03:08:57,980 --> 03:08:59,400
Where do I go?

2562
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:07,380
Where do I go?

2563
03:09:10,090 --> 03:09:10,910
Thanks, mister.

2564
03:09:11,790 --> 03:09:14,210
I needed that.

2565
03:09:14,510 --> 03:09:14,910
I needed that.

2566
03:09:14,910 --> 03:09:15,610
Farewell, brother.

2567
03:09:16,390 --> 03:09:18,630
I fear I deliver you to a darker place.

2568
03:09:19,350 --> 03:09:21,550
May the light of lights illuminate your path.

2569
03:09:21,750 --> 03:09:22,570
Wait, are you gonna die?

2570
03:09:22,970 --> 03:09:23,630
No, he's fine.

2571
03:09:23,890 --> 03:09:25,610
Look to your own salvation.

2572
03:09:26,170 --> 03:09:26,230
Salvation.

2573
03:09:38,250 --> 03:09:38,830
Father!

2574
03:09:40,850 --> 03:09:42,150
Oh, he's still alive in there.

2575
03:09:45,450 --> 03:09:51,210
I like how you can see where, like, the bombs drop that, like, released the head crabs.

2576
03:09:55,550 --> 03:09:56,850
Oh, God, no!

2577
03:09:59,050 --> 03:10:00,450
He's so awesome!

2578
03:10:04,960 --> 03:10:06,580
What's over here?

2579
03:10:08,700 --> 03:10:12,160
His laughter rings throughout the hills.

2580
03:10:17,950 --> 03:10:18,990
Oh

2581
03:10:22,560 --> 03:10:24,080
my gosh.

2582
03:10:27,420 --> 03:10:28,340
Did I survive?

2583
03:10:28,840 --> 03:10:30,520
Am I out of that town?

2584
03:10:39,070 --> 03:10:39,670
Almost.

2585
03:10:41,110 --> 03:10:42,510
Almost there.

2586
03:10:54,640 --> 03:10:56,380
Just in case.

2587
03:10:58,480 --> 03:11:00,480
How do I get that one?

2588
03:11:05,550 --> 03:11:06,330
Now the drop.

2589
03:11:06,590 --> 03:11:07,070
We're just dropping.

2590
03:11:07,250 --> 03:11:08,290
Where are we dropping, boys?

2591
03:11:11,030 --> 03:11:11,590
Oh, he's...

2592
03:11:11,590 --> 03:11:13,610
Major fraction detected.

2593
03:11:14,090 --> 03:11:14,530
Carefully.

2594
03:11:15,310 --> 03:11:15,350
Oh.

2595
03:11:16,530 --> 03:11:18,190
Well, I didn't see where else to drop.

2596
03:11:24,130 --> 03:11:24,970
Legs broken.

2597
03:11:30,530 --> 03:11:33,170
There's no other way to do it.

2598
03:11:33,850 --> 03:11:34,970
We beat you!

2599
03:11:37,730 --> 03:11:38,950
redirect

2600
03:11:57,500 --> 03:12:08,950
that didn't do anything okay i think i just drop uh here oh my gosh don't fall

2601
03:12:15,930 --> 03:12:18,070
it's nasty down here

2602
03:12:28,550 --> 03:12:29,970
i'm gonna save

2603
03:12:35,810 --> 03:12:36,920
what's that

2604
03:12:42,420 --> 03:12:42,900
Oh!

2605
03:12:44,400 --> 03:12:46,160
To himself, thank you so much!

2606
03:12:46,760 --> 03:12:47,000
Wait.

2607
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:56,080
Good time to mention this cancelled Half-Life 2 spin-off Half-Life Ravenholm that would have had you return to the iconic ghost town as Adrian Shepard.

2608
03:12:56,680 --> 03:12:57,940
Who's Adrian Shepard?

2609
03:12:59,060 --> 03:13:00,020
Ticcup, thank you!

2610
03:13:00,360 --> 03:13:00,940
Thanks to the gifted!

2611
03:13:01,460 --> 03:13:02,300
Thank you!

2612
03:13:02,360 --> 03:13:03,700
Poseidon, welcome back!

2613
03:13:03,820 --> 03:13:05,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2614
03:13:16,410 --> 03:13:17,170
Oh, whoops.

2615
03:13:20,690 --> 03:13:21,570
Please work.

2616
03:13:24,970 --> 03:13:26,270
Oh, I think I actually got a guy.

2617
03:13:40,680 --> 03:13:41,260
Oh, man.

2618
03:13:43,980 --> 03:13:45,020
They noticed me.

2619
03:13:47,420 --> 03:13:49,300
I like how they bump into each other.

2620
03:13:49,440 --> 03:13:50,000
It's kind of cute.

2621
03:13:56,610 --> 03:13:58,430
Those zombies here, so crowbar should be fine.

2622
03:13:58,990 --> 03:13:59,890
Oh, yeah.

2623
03:14:01,190 --> 03:14:02,030
Okay, wait.

2624
03:14:02,150 --> 03:14:04,470
Now I'm going to go back this way.

2625
03:14:05,210 --> 03:14:06,470
Figure out where I need to go.

2626
03:14:06,490 --> 03:14:07,550
go from here.

2627
03:14:08,230 --> 03:14:10,030
Okay, everything just looks like I need to drop.

2628
03:14:10,470 --> 03:14:11,250
But that's scary.

2629
03:14:11,970 --> 03:14:18,310
So I'm just going to avoid that until it's... Okay, that... Now I must.

2630
03:14:20,910 --> 03:14:22,470
Okay, cool.

2631
03:14:23,370 --> 03:14:25,170
Yeah, love that.

2632
03:14:27,050 --> 03:14:28,990
It's not that bad, you say that.

2633
03:14:30,730 --> 03:14:32,230
But I'm frightened!

2634
03:14:33,630 --> 03:14:35,730
I'm quite frightened, you know.

2635
03:14:39,650 --> 03:14:40,210
Whack!

2636
03:14:46,380 --> 03:14:46,600
Whack!

2637
03:14:46,840 --> 03:14:46,960
Whack!

2638
03:14:47,340 --> 03:14:47,340
Whack!

2639
03:14:47,520 --> 03:14:47,520
Whack!

2640
03:14:47,640 --> 03:14:47,740
Whack!

2641
03:14:48,420 --> 03:14:48,980
Whack!

2642
03:14:50,060 --> 03:14:51,940
I died immediately.

2643
03:14:53,840 --> 03:14:54,420
Can't patrol.

2644
03:14:54,520 --> 03:14:55,520
Thank you so much for the tickets!

2645
03:14:56,140 --> 03:14:58,100
Thank you.

2646
03:15:01,170 --> 03:15:01,730
Okay.

2647
03:15:02,390 --> 03:15:04,210
These guys are kind of tough.

2648
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:14,050
If I fall from over there, do I get damaged?

2649
03:15:16,310 --> 03:15:16,650
Hum.

2650
03:15:21,900 --> 03:15:25,640
I guess I could try... I don't want to waste all my ammo up here, you know?

2651
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:27,140
I think that'd be kind of silly.

2652
03:15:28,120 --> 03:15:28,520
Rip.

2653
03:15:32,320 --> 03:15:32,920
Dodge them?

2654
03:15:33,680 --> 03:15:35,280
Let's just... Yeah, you know what?

2655
03:15:35,500 --> 03:15:36,560
I saved, so what?

2656
03:15:37,500 --> 03:15:41,060
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

2657
03:15:41,220 --> 03:15:44,600
I'm dodging, I'm dodging, I'm dodging, and running, and dodging, and running, and dodging, and running.

2658
03:15:48,060 --> 03:15:49,960
I'm dodging, I'm dodging, I'm dodging, I'm dodging, oh!

2659
03:15:51,900 --> 03:15:52,740
Oh my gosh.

2660
03:15:54,600 --> 03:15:55,920
Oh my gosh.

2661
03:16:03,150 --> 03:16:03,850
That didn't work.

2662
03:16:04,250 --> 03:16:04,750
That didn't work.

2663
03:16:09,710 --> 03:16:10,350
Oh my gosh.

2664
03:16:10,550 --> 03:16:12,390
I was just scratching my nose, please.

2665
03:16:14,910 --> 03:16:15,350
Give a girl.

2666
03:16:34,070 --> 03:16:36,050
Take out those guys as quickly as I can.

2667
03:16:36,270 --> 03:16:36,950
I don't know where to go.

2668
03:16:37,310 --> 03:16:37,910
That's the only issue.

2669
03:16:41,520 --> 03:16:41,980
Oh my gosh.

2670
03:16:41,980 --> 03:16:43,020
I

2671
03:16:46,210 --> 03:16:49,330
saw some health over here.

2672
03:16:49,930 --> 03:16:50,890
Oh, but I can't get in there.

2673
03:16:51,750 --> 03:16:53,110
Wait, was I...

2674
03:16:53,110 --> 03:16:53,650
Oh my gosh.

2675
03:16:57,830 --> 03:16:58,070
Ouch.

2676
03:16:58,830 --> 03:16:59,810
Stop it.

2677
03:16:59,890 --> 03:17:00,730
Stop it.

2678
03:17:01,170 --> 03:17:03,310
I'm trying to just go and climb the stairs.

2679
03:17:05,650 --> 03:17:07,650
I didn't think it was in here.

2680
03:17:11,720 --> 03:17:13,680
Because I can't go anywhere from here.

2681
03:17:20,880 --> 03:17:21,920
Oh, I can.

2682
03:17:25,360 --> 03:17:27,000
Oh my gosh.

2683
03:17:27,340 --> 03:17:28,180
Oh my gosh.

2684
03:17:28,780 --> 03:17:29,160
Ah!

2685
03:17:32,720 --> 03:17:33,000
Oh, okay.

2686
03:17:33,820 --> 03:17:35,680
Ah, this is where it puts me!

2687
03:17:35,820 --> 03:17:36,820
This is so evil!

2688
03:17:37,820 --> 03:17:39,980
You can't be serious right now!

2689
03:17:42,400 --> 03:17:42,660
Ah!

2690
03:17:53,790 --> 03:17:55,850
Oh my goodness gracious.

2691
03:17:59,590 --> 03:18:01,330
That was so evil.

2692
03:18:06,790 --> 03:18:09,030
Did it shoot it at me?

2693
03:18:09,850 --> 03:18:10,130
Nice!

2694
03:18:15,820 --> 03:18:17,020
Trick shot.

2695
03:18:17,660 --> 03:18:18,600
First try.

2696
03:18:19,680 --> 03:18:20,420
Alright, let's see.

2697
03:18:21,480 --> 03:18:23,780
I think, guys, I'm gonna call it there for today.

2698
03:18:24,580 --> 03:18:25,240
Rip Gret.

2699
03:18:26,100 --> 03:18:29,740
Oh, my brain is feeling so...

2700
03:18:29,740 --> 03:18:33,400
But I think I will.

2701
03:18:34,660 --> 03:18:35,440
Call it there.

2702
03:18:35,740 --> 03:18:37,740
Oh, uh...

2703
03:18:41,430 --> 03:18:42,470
And yeah.

2704
03:18:44,530 --> 03:18:46,390
Ravenholm is a stressful map!

2705
03:18:47,170 --> 03:18:47,850
Holy moly!

2706
03:18:48,810 --> 03:18:51,590
I am so- I'm so- I was already tired starting this.

2707
03:18:51,690 --> 03:18:53,290
And I feel tired still, but...

2708
03:18:53,950 --> 03:18:58,590
Like, I feel like I ran to- I'm about to hit the chapter end?

2709
03:18:58,690 --> 03:18:59,250
Oh, am I?

2710
03:18:59,550 --> 03:19:01,590
Okay, then we'll- we'll go to the chapter end.

2711
03:19:02,590 --> 03:19:03,470
I'm guessing down here.

2712
03:19:04,310 --> 03:19:04,670
Yeah?

2713
03:19:05,170 --> 03:19:05,570
Maybe?

2714
03:19:05,830 --> 03:19:06,150
Yes.

2715
03:19:07,310 --> 03:19:07,830
Okay.

2716
03:19:07,870 --> 03:19:11,750
If you say I'm about to hit it, then I'll go until we hit it.

2717
03:19:21,990 --> 03:19:23,610
That's not a guy, is it?

2718
03:19:24,130 --> 03:19:25,250
Oh, I think it is.

2719
03:19:37,320 --> 03:19:39,280
Did he need me to go up there, though?

2720
03:19:39,960 --> 03:19:40,280
Actually.

2721
03:19:41,880 --> 03:19:42,640
Look, Gordon.

2722
03:19:42,860 --> 03:19:43,260
Gropes.

2723
03:19:47,180 --> 03:19:48,620
Or do I go through here?

2724
03:19:51,080 --> 03:19:51,480
No.

2725
03:19:51,920 --> 03:19:52,180
No.

2726
03:19:53,400 --> 03:19:55,540
Oh wait, I go around it.

2727
03:19:55,660 --> 03:19:56,180
I'm stupid.

2728
03:19:56,560 --> 03:19:56,960
My bad.

2729
03:20:14,960 --> 03:20:17,500
There's dead people no matter where you go.

2730
03:20:24,160 --> 03:20:26,260
Okay, that should take care of anything up there.

2731
03:20:27,320 --> 03:20:29,220
And it comes back down.

2732
03:20:33,810 --> 03:20:34,550
Wait, huh?

2733
03:20:36,730 --> 03:20:37,290
Oh.

2734
03:20:49,900 --> 03:20:52,840
I didn't realize I was so close to it.

2735
03:20:55,180 --> 03:20:56,100
Run after it.

2736
03:20:56,760 --> 03:20:56,860
Okay.

2737
03:20:58,100 --> 03:20:58,470
Oh!

2738
03:21:00,100 --> 03:21:01,200
Too soon?

2739
03:21:15,390 --> 03:21:16,870
Oh gosh.

2740
03:21:18,630 --> 03:21:20,170
I should have ducked.

2741
03:21:21,430 --> 03:21:21,870
Okay.

2742
03:21:22,250 --> 03:21:22,890
I understand.

2743
03:21:25,390 --> 03:21:27,850
Not what they meant by half-life.

2744
03:21:29,090 --> 03:21:30,490
Yeah, I need to crouch.

2745
03:21:30,890 --> 03:21:31,790
I understand now.

2746
03:21:32,210 --> 03:21:33,150
Oh my gosh, I'm trapped on it.

2747
03:21:38,430 --> 03:21:42,910

2748
03:21:49,270 --> 03:22:06,170

03:22:18,030 --> 03:22:21,570

2750
03:22:27,800 --> 03:22:28,920
Is this...

2751
03:22:28,920 --> 03:22:30,600
This is what we mean by end of chapter?

2752
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:39,820
Please, God no, I'm so sick of you guys.

2753
03:22:43,740 --> 03:22:44,320
The sun!

2754
03:22:44,800 --> 03:22:45,280
I know!

2755
03:22:46,160 --> 03:22:48,760
We finally are out in the sun!

2756
03:22:59,890 --> 03:23:01,010
More guns.

2757
03:23:01,790 --> 03:23:02,450
But I'm full.

2758
03:23:04,570 --> 03:23:05,350
Good place to stop.

2759
03:23:05,370 --> 03:23:07,450
Wait, but it's not the end of the chapter?

2760
03:23:08,670 --> 03:23:09,950
There will be a chapter title.

2761
03:23:10,270 --> 03:23:11,050
Oh, that's right.

2762
03:23:16,480 --> 03:23:18,920
Why have you guys...

2763
03:23:18,920 --> 03:23:23,540
Why are you guys here, too?

2764
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:40,340
This is the best stopping point.

2765
03:23:40,460 --> 03:23:40,660
Okay.

2766
03:23:41,220 --> 03:23:42,320
Then we'll stop here.

2767
03:23:44,340 --> 03:23:45,980
Let me actually do a hard save.

2768
03:23:49,400 --> 03:23:49,680

03:23:51,920 --> 03:23:53,660

I don't want to go back.

2772
03:24:31,240 --> 03:24:35,400
You guys were right to be so weary.

2773
03:24:37,820 --> 03:24:39,460
But this was a lot of fun.

2774
03:24:40,520 --> 03:24:40,900
I don't know.

2775
03:24:41,340 --> 03:24:43,160
Maybe if I...

2776
03:24:43,160 --> 03:24:44,680
How much do I have left of the game?

2777
03:24:45,780 --> 03:24:51,200
If I do a bunch next week, will I finish?

2778
03:24:56,100 --> 03:24:56,740
Still a lot?

2779
03:24:57,040 --> 03:24:58,680
Wait, four to six hours is not a lot.

2780
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:00,640
A lot.

2781
03:25:01,780 --> 03:25:02,460
Okay, never mind.

2782
03:25:02,580 --> 03:25:03,480
Then we have a lot, a lot.

2783
03:25:03,780 --> 03:25:04,160
Okay, cool.

2784
03:25:06,280 --> 03:25:06,920
Two thirds.

2785
03:25:07,280 --> 03:25:08,640
People are saying 20 out.

2786
03:25:08,720 --> 03:25:09,320
I can't tell.

2787
03:25:10,280 --> 03:25:10,920
Ten hours.

2788
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:11,840
I'm getting ten hours.

2789
03:25:11,960 --> 03:25:13,000
I'm getting four hours.

2790
03:25:13,600 --> 03:25:14,820
Do you guys know how to tell time?

2791
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:20,220
And then some people are saying I'm two thirds of the way in.

2792
03:25:20,300 --> 03:25:21,980
Some people are saying I'm a third of the way in.

2793
03:25:22,060 --> 03:25:23,980
Some people are saying I'm halfway in.

2794
03:25:27,690 --> 03:25:30,650
I don't know if you guys have ever looked at a clock before.

2795
03:25:31,010 --> 03:25:32,430
A hundred hours.

2796
03:25:33,910 --> 03:25:35,370
Time for new outfits on karaoke.

2797
03:25:35,570 --> 03:25:35,830
Yeah!

2798
03:25:36,310 --> 03:25:39,970
It'll be just a little bit of karaoke outfit tomorrow.

2799
03:25:40,630 --> 03:25:42,190
So, um, yeah.

2800
03:25:46,480 --> 03:25:47,440

2801
03:25:47,540 --> 03:25:48,060
We will do it.

2802
03:25:48,080 --> 03:25:48,560
We will do it.

2803
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:49,980
I have stuff to prepare.

2804
03:25:50,180 --> 03:25:51,180
So I will go do that.

2805
03:25:51,640 --> 03:25:52,780
Otso Vito, everybody.

2806
