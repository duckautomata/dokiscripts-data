00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:32,740
Hello!

2
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,500
Welcome back!

3
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,580
Master!

4
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,040
Lady!

5
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,200
Hello everybody!

6
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,540
Oha!

7
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,300
Oha!

8
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,060
Oha!

9
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,300
Oha!

10
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,200
Oha!

11
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:46,540
Oha!

12
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,660
Why am I saying Oha?

13
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,360
I don't know anymore Hello Mint!

14
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,320
Hello!

15
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,240
It's not Oha Mint!

16
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,160
Oha!

17
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,320
Yay!

18
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,980
Alright, welcome back for 5 months.

19
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,840
Thank you, welcome guys.

20
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:09,900
Two!

21
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,200
Some Playstation demo discs.

22
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,820
Hold on, let me grab them.

23
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,860
I don't know where to put my controller.

24
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,540
One second, one second.

25
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,600
I see birthday.

26
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,160
Hold on, let me talk first.

27
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,640
I need to do like a hold on birthdays.

28
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,700
We need to be like, first 5 minutes of the stream.

29
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,060
Let me talk a little first.

30
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,720
Hold!

31
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,140
I have one...

32
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,720
Two...

33
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,120
Three...

34
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,120
Four...

35
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,440
Five...

36
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,260
Six...

37
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,540
Seven...

38
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,500
Eight...

39
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,220
Nine...

40
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,540
Ten!

41
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,200
I have ten...

42
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,360
Ten...

43
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,260
Ten...

44
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,420
Ten demo discs.

45
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,320
That were given to me.

46
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,160
So many.

47
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,140
They're all from the old Playstation magazines.

48
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,360
So, we'll just...

49
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,600
I can't tell if these have been opened or not before.

50
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
Oh, some of them.

51
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,740
Maybe.

52
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
This one feels sealed.

53
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,820
This one feels sealed!

54
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,960
I can't tell.

55
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,820
Oh, no, maybe.

56
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,960
Oh, no, no.

57
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,720
I can't tell.

58
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,680
I can't tell!

59
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,340
So I feel that maybe...

60
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,300
You know, we might have a part 3 of this eventually.

61
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,760
Last time I did this, we had some funny demo discs that we did.

62
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,100
I can't stop thinking about the ants one.

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,700
So if you didn't watch... I say part 1.

64
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,400
It's just I did this before.

65
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,560
If you didn't see the first one that I did...

66
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,460
Yeah, go check it out.

67
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,300
Because we just went down memory lane.

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,100
Hopefully all of these work as well, because...

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,940
You know, they're all so old.

70
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh, the bugs life!

71
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,140
Yeah, not ants.

72
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:13,820
Sorry, yeah.

73
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,620
Bugs life.

74
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,900
That was so funny.

75
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,220
Gamer, thank you for 10 months.

76
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,300
Ta... taco... taco... taco...

77
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,620
Toki beefs, thanks for 5 months.

78
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,040
Tidal wave, thanks for 2 months.

79
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,660
I believe I have a birthday.

80
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:30,920
To sing!

81
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,820
Wait, hold on one second.

82
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:39,760
Oh, there we go.

83
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,040
Happy birthday to you.

84
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Happy birthday to you.

85
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,560
Happy birthday, Agent Heroic.

86
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,720
Happy birthday to you.

87
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
Happy birthday!

88
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,340
So...

89
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,340
I think I might just pick some of these randomly.

90
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,960
Though, there are some that I see and I'm like...

91
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,320
I kinda wanna do this one.

92
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,160
11 months already.

93
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,580
Um...

94
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,940
The movie Ants was created to compete against Bugs Life.

95
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,260
Oh!

96
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,740
Then I did a faux pas, I know.

97
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,620
I did something probably so scandalous.

98
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:33,040
Some of these discs have the game's...

99
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,420
Ah, that scared me.

100
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,000
On them.

101
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,600
Just gonna take you back to past.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,260
Some of them don't have what games are on them.

103
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,940
Some of these...

104
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
Oh my god!

105
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,780
I haven't really looked at all of them.

106
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh my gosh.

107
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,980
Oh my gosh, so maybe I'll just do these randomly.

108
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,320
And of course, yes, there's Metal Gear in here.

109
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,360
Of course there's Metal Gear in here.

110
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,080
Actually, well, there's two.

111
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,740
But one's a game demo and one is not a game demo.

112
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,380
But there is one that I do want to do.

113
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,280
Which is the demo of Yakuza.

114
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,960
Which, I don't know, you might have seen it in the thumbnail.

115
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,320
But it's there.

116
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,460
Oh, there's a replay of here of Ape Escape.

117
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,480
We don't have Ape Escape.

118
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,680
Wow, there's the Metal Gear.

119
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,780
Wait, there's three Metal Gear.

120
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,220
Oh!

121
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,080
There's a replay of Ace Combat.

122
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,220
It's a replay.

123
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,260
No!

124
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,980
Oh my gosh, this is Lego.

125
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,040
Oh, I thought that said Five Nights at Freddy's.

126
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,720
I was going to be like, wow, they have Five Nights at Freddy's on PS2?

127
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,860
It was...

128
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not Five Nights at Freddy's.

129
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,020
It's Fight Night Round 2.

130
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,620
Which I guess you could see, I saw something that starts with an F.

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,640
I saw Night.

132
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,900
And then I saw that the title was kind of long.

133
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,380
And then...

134
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Interesting.

135
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,460
This one has only three games.

136
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,280
Whoever got this magazine got completely...

137
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,620
But it has portable ops video.

138
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,720
But they got completely scammed.

139
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,060
Okay, I'm just going to pick randomly then.

140
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,020
Fight Night at Freddy's Round 2.

141
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,480
Pretty much, pretty much.

142
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,820
I'm going to pick randomly.

143
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,940
Oh, wait, I also have a disc that is open.

144
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,580
I picked this one at random.

145
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't...

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,340
Oh, there is something in here that I want to play.

147
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,720
I picked this one at random.

148
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,900
I'm going to put it in now.

149
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,600
Oh, oh my gosh.

150
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,460
It's all ripped up.

151
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:10,980
I'm checking the discs.

152
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,280
The discs actually seem in pretty good quality.

153
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,780
Like, pretty good shape.

154
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,180
Not a lot of scratches.

155
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:18,820
Yippee!

156
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,180
Okay, opening.

157
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,640
Closing.

158
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,160
Okay.

159
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,020
The scratches give them soul.

160
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,060
I don't...

161
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,740
I want them to work though.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,980
Nice.

163
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,000
Their battle scars.

164
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,460
I'm also playing through OBS.

165
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:55,480
Okay.

166
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,440
He's so loud.

167
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,920
Because...

168
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,140
Guys, I'm so...

169
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,380
I'm feeling so icky today.

170
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm so sorry.

171
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,080
What is this?

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,020
You guys rec...

173
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,460
Inaccessible.

174
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,780
What is this?

175
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,020
It's sexy.

176
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,040
It's sexy, whatever this is.

177
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,480
The Matrix!

178
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,610
This stream has not yet been rated.

179
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,010
Look at her go.

180
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:39,890
Oh!

181
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:40,670
Oh!

182
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,840
Yuki, I saw your super chat.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
I will sing, of course.

184
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,400
After this.

185
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,600
She looks like...

186
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,200
Akoto Kusanagi.

187
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,860
Ghost in the Shell.

188
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,460
What is this?

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,360
Oh, stolen.

190
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,240
Coming soon, you guys!

191
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,320
Coming soon!

192
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,160
Coming soon!

193
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,800
Any day now.

194
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,640
It's doing this all on its own.

195
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,660
I'm not touching it.

196
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,820
My game is possessed.

197
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,580
It's my birthday tomorrow, but unfortunately I'll be busy and probably won't be able to watch the stream tomorrow.

198
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,920
I'll try to make it if I can.

199
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,180
In case, can you sing happy birthday today?

200
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:42,980
Of course, Yuki!

201
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,900
Happy birthday to you!

202
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,700
Happy birthday to you!

203
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,100
Happy birthday, Yuki!

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,200
Happy birthday to you!

205
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,680
Happy birthday!

206
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,160
Alright, let's see what we got in here.

207
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,120
Playground.

208
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,220
Oh, was that...

209
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,500
Was that E.T.?

210
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,960
It won't let me go back.

211
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,400
Why is it like this?

212
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,120
It like automatically moves, but if I try...

213
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,860
It's fighting with me!

214
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,020
Stop!

215
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,000
Stop!

216
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,600
I'm trying to see!

217
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,240
I can't tell.

218
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:24,940
Stop!

219
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,800
I don't think it's my controller.

220
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,040
Is it?

221
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,720
I don't think so.

222
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,580
It was my controller!

223
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,980
We're gonna have a good time, I think.

224
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,840
This is the one I wanted to play.

225
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,970
Every single one of these has to have a sport game.

226
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,930
What is Musashi Samurai Legend?

227
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,270
I'm so curious.

228
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,090
Let's try it.

229
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,070
Defend.

230
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,130
Run, walk, jump.

231
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,630
Katana.

232
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,230
Perform selected technique.

233
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,850
Lock on.

234
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,150
A bad sequel?

235
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,910
Oh, okay.

236
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,370
We're gonna try.

237
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,290
We're gonna try.

238
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,530
It's from Square Enix.

239
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,870
Let's see how it is.

240
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,730
There it is.

241
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:29,330
Square.

242
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:31,670
Square Enix.

243
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,510
Oh my god!

244
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,290
It is a hundred... Oh my god!

245
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,970
It's so... World ends with you!

246
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,730
So...

247
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,410
Oh my gosh!

248
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,950
I couldn't tell from the art before.

249
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,670
Oh my gosh!

250
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,650
So... Wow!

251
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,710
Happy birthday!

252
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,070
Okay, Powder.

253
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,790
You got me right before I started the game.

254
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,870
Happy birthday to you!

255
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:07,610
Happy birthday to you!

256
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,810
Happy birthday Powder Girls!

257
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,670
Happy birthday to you!

258
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,030
Happy birthday!

259
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,830
I like how there is just no music.

260
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,210
No nothing.

261
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,830
What is this?

262
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,870
What are those pants?

263
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:26,850
That's Peek.

264
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,310
That's just a product of it's time.

265
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,650
Nebulium Tower.

266
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,920
V2!

267
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,380
What are the abs on this guy?

268
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,880
Oh my... Wow!

269
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,320
Wow!

270
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,000
Wow!

271
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,860
That's all he said!

272
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:09,270
Even the interface looks very Kingdom Hearts.

273
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,640
The hair goes crazy.

274
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,660
I'm gonna kick and punch him off the thing.

275
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
I thought he would...

276
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,060
Oh I got money from him.

277
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,280
Excuse me!

278
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,520
Let's go.

279
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,520
There is so many of these guys.

280
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,280
There is so many of them.

281
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,680
And then also...

282
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,700
Let me know how the audio is.

283
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,060
Oh there is this thing too.

284
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,620
At least they are easy.

285
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,320
There is so many of them though.

286
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,980
They don't do anything.

287
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,680
Camera controls are...

288
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,560
Oh no they are not inverted.

289
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm just stupid.

290
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,700
There is so many of them!

291
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,140
Please!

292
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:36,640
Wow, my reaction to a miss.

293
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,220
There is so many.

294
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,660
I'm just gonna run past them.

295
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,980
Oh god I'm gonna die in the demo.

296
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:50,780
Please!

297
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,120
I don't wanna fight all these guys.

298
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:52,480
Please!

299
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,880
There is so many.

300
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,760
What the hell are you?

301
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,280
Oh they look like that girl from...

302
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,960
From Darkstalkers.

303
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,560
At least we get a new enemy.

304
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
I can't see!

305
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,440
I can't see!

306
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,260
Fucking

307
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,310
claws.

308
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,730
They are really easy.

309
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:26,450
I

310
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,020
don't remember her name so you guys might be saying the right one, but I don't know.

311
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,300
Ouchie ouchie.

312
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't know what's going on.

313
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,840
You guys said it's a sequel?

314
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,400
Give me all my cash money baby.

315
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,880
I don't know how to change what thing I'm doing.

316
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,800
Oh here we go.

317
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,380
Paralyzing palm, shooting star.

318
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,360
Let's try that one instead.

319
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,060
Do they stop ever?

320
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,340
What else we got?

321
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,820
Celestial strike.

322
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,320
It's a combat demo!

323
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
What if I keep going?

324
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,070
More of these guys.

325
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,370
OK.

326
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:44,730
Oh shoot.

327
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:45,410
Oh shoot.

328
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,870
Oh shoot.

329
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,950
The camera is kinda wacky.

330
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,630
OK we can make it through guys.

331
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,590
We are just gonna run past.

332
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:55,050
Oh god.

333
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,400
Wait.

334
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:27,140
They are just politely waiting for me.

335
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,770
Very nice.

336
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,670
Yeah.

337
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,410
Stupid.

338
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,090
This is like watching those hurdlers knocking each one over.

339
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,670
Look.

340
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:54,370
I was...

341
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,250
You know...

342
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,370
I was testing their...

343
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,730
They have a range of motion.

344
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,590
I was testing it.

345
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,350
Let's get in the elevator.

346
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,750
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

347
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:18,230
Thank you.

348
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:21,990
Pass that floor.

349
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,910
We are going to the roof.

350
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,630
This guy's pants.

351
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,540
Vaporoid.

352
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,080
Boss battle so soon.

353
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,000
Can I paralyze this guy?

354
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm paralyzing you.

355
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,820
I shouldn't have wasted so much health.

356
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:07,700
I think.

357
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,820
I don't like the camera on this.

358
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,260
OK.

359
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,740
I don't think I should use this one.

360
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,560
Let's try the celestial strike.

361
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:19,880
What are you doing?

362
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,240
Please.

363
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:49,590
Time's up.

364
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,110
I thought

365
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,670
I died.

366
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:56,930
OK.

367
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,210
Coming 2005, everybody.

368
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,950
You can play this.

369
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,790
OK.

370
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:07,270
Guys, we have to play.

371
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,470
We have to play.

372
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,730
Wait.

373
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,210
Is Area 51 any good?

374
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,890
Is this one any fun?

375
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:20,230
I'm going to... Since I have so many discs...

376
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,410
It's not that I'm on a time limit or anything, but...

377
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,510
I don't feel 100% today.

378
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,190
I might do like 3 games.

379
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,490
2 or 3 games per disc.

380
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:34,350
We'll see how... What interesting ones we got, you know?

381
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,410
Why is L1 junk?

382
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:37,270
What?

383
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,890
Aim, move character.

384
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,630
What?

385
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:46,870
L1 is...

386
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,370
I didn't press it yet.

387
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,550
It said clearly you do not want to play this game.

388
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,630
Grenade is previous weapon, next weapon.

389
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,310
I'm not going to remember any of this.

390
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:56,770
That's OK.

391
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,290
The FPS.

392
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,310
It looked like a FPS.

393
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,710
Look at the aliens!

394
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:13,810
Found footage.

395
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:19,230
What was that movie that did the ARG thing?

396
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,970
Oh lord.

397
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,790
Cloverfield.

398
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

399
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:41,990
Huh?

400
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,650
This guy looks like he's trying to become an alien.

401
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,490
Can you just speak up please?

402
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,490
I turned up the volume even.

403
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,600
PS1.

404
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,560
No, this is PS2.

405
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,920
But yeah, it still looks really, really good.

406
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,460
It looks really good.

407
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,140
Yeah, you're right.

408
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,320
Oh no!

409
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,480
Progress must take a step back.

410
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,640
Hasmat Team Delta responds to emergency calls at Area 51.

411
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,900
Oh, I can...OK, there we go.

412
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,320
The company that made this game doesn't exist anymore.

413
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,660
Really?

414
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,140
9 months of membership.

415
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:44,960
Thank you, Reese.

416
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,580
Thank you.

417
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,640
Thank you, thank you.

418
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,020
Wow.

419
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,280
It looks like Samus.

420
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,520
Samus suit.

421
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,000
You could say they were mid-way.

422
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,880
They never made it to the final destination.

423
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,520
They got stuck mid-way.

424
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,870
Oh no.

425
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,710
Oh no.

426
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,530
How do I...actually, how do I shoot with the gun?

427
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,310
I said X to use.

428
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,650
Maybe that...

429
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,270
Does X to use mean use the gun?

430
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:45,270
I didn't look up how to use the gun.

431
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:47,350
R1?

432
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,170
OK, OK.

433
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,370
Is he getting possessed?

434
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,050
Nah, he's dead.

435
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,290
Oh he's possessed!

436
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,370
It's voice activated like Lifeline.

437
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,970
God, please no.

438
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,350
Regular man.

439
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,930
Regular man.

440
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:14,190
Otaku.

441
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:17,430
Regular man.

442
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,590
What is this voice acting?

443
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,250
Alien pig!

444
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,750
Alien pig!

445
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:49,420
OK, start with lies of the past.

446
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,440
OK, now it's louder.

447
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,240
Horrors.

448
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,040
Don't spoil it.

449
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:13,120
As we descended into this hell, my teammates were killed, one by one.

450
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,280
I escaped death, but in that fight for survival, I became infected.

451
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,780
I was changed.

452
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,800
As my powers grew, my humanity died.

453
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,120
In the end, I was left to complete this mission, alone.

454
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,740
I could have just kind of...

455
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,680
I didn't press anything.

456
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,580
OK.

457
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,540
Find the comm station and contact bridges.

458
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,840
OK, hold on.

459
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,720
Shoot.

460
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:41,960
Oh, that's...yeah.

461
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,740
Is there like a...OK.

462
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,300
What is this, actually?

463
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:47,700
Oh, OK.

464
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,160
It's not hold, it's a trigger.

465
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:49,600
OK.

466
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,440
OK.

467
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,300
Jump is...

468
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,440
And crouch.

469
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,560
And jump.

470
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:01,800
And crouch.

471
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,140
Oh gosh, I'm scared of the aliens.

472
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,540
I'm scared.

473
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,840
Look what's going on here.

474
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,240
It's absolute craziness.

475
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,100
Oh no, it's inverted controls.

476
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,740
OK, I definitely will mess that up.

477
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,480
I'm sorry, guys.

478
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,060
What's that?

479
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:35,530
Jacksfilms?

480
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:38,770
Who are you?

481
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,530
Let me in.

482
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,560
Oh, that's right.

483
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,300
That's reload.

484
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,340
Jump is this.

485
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,460
For some reason.

486
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,900
Jump.

487
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,260
OK.

488
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,300
Let's try this door.

489
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,880
Maybe use...

490
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,280
No.

491
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,260
Oh my gosh, a person on the moon.

492
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,080
Do they just have that on loop?

493
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:16,960
Press the button.

494
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,540
I'm trying.

495
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,020
I don't know.

496
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,940
I'm pressing X.

497
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,600
I am.

498
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,320
Press, press, press, press, press.

499
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:25,860
Check the front desk, maybe?

500
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,980
Oh yeah, maybe there's like a card key or something, right?

501
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,300
All the aliens are waiting for me.

502
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,520
Oh god, I hate inverted controls.

503
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,280
Door access.

504
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,820
I'm pressing X.

505
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,920
How do I X?

506
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,640
Oh, there we go.

507
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,580
I just had to look at it.

508
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:47,840
OK.

509
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,320
Shoot.

510
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,300
Sorry.

511
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,260
Shoot.

512
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,200
Oh god, hold on.

513
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,900
Please hold this controller.

514
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,380
That's why are you both shooting at me?

515
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,750
This is bad you guys.

516
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,330
This is bad.

517
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,730
Oh this is bad.

518
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,270
Invert controls.

519
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,710
I can't see anything.

520
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,350
I think I died.

521
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:29,460
I don't know actually.

522
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,880
I'm also going to turn off vibration.

523
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,580
Oh thank goodness.

524
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,440
Yes!

525
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,260
OK, we're so back.

526
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,880
We're so back, baby.

527
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,240
Alright.

528
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,100
Here we go.

529
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,440
They're going to come in and I'm going to start shooting them.

530
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,420
Nice.

531
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,740
I can't see with all this.

532
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,360
I'm just standing here and getting blasted.

533
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,640
I'm going to throw a grenade.

534
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,620
That's not a grenade.

535
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,460
This is a grenade.

536
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,360
Hello sir.

537
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,160
Oh god.

538
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,240
I think I'm done with this game.

539
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:15,920
Throw a grenade.

540
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,560
Oh we both threw at the same time.

541
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,240
Isn't that so romantic?

542
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,120
The screen shake is wild.

543
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,660
I can't see anything when I'm shooting for real.

544
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,180
Holy cow.

545
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,500
OK.

546
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,780
Thank you Area 51.

547
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,590
Wow, what a cover.

548
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:43,010
Wow.

549
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,920
Oh my goodness.

550
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,700
The real answers behind the crash at Rot...

551
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,000
OK, I was reading that.

552
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,380
Remember

553
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,810
the reviews of this game?

554
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,450
They said David Dukovny from the X-Files sounded really bored.

555
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,590
They were right.

556
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,750
Oh, that's him.

557
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,790
Alright guys.

558
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:19,170
The real game of today.

559
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,690
Oh, I know this one.

560
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,690
But we're going to play the Spongebob Squarepants movie demo.

561
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,090
Doomdiowee green man throw.

562
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,790
Oh, here we go.

563
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,930
Move menu cursor?

564
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:37,930
Move PC.

565
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,560
Paddy... I can control Spongebob Patrick.

566
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,100
Or the Paddy...

567
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,420
You can check Y's.

568
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,840
That would be cool, but no biggie.

569
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,480
Is it Ys or Ys?

570
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,020
I can't remember how it's pronounced.

571
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,780
The car in the movie.

572
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,660
Let's see how far we get through this and then we can maybe check it out.

573
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,000
Ease.

574
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,900
Yeah, OK.

575
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,260
I thought...

576
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,250
Spongebob... I imagine this is the first movie.

577
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,310
Oh my gosh.

578
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,550
It's pronounced Laurel.

579
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,790
I hear Yanny.

580
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,930
Yanny, Yanny, Yanny, Yanny.

581
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,230
Nick Games.

582
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:43,330
Actually, this week, it's so funny, I almost played that Nickelodeon Showdown game.

583
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,570
I wanted to play the... how do you... it's like, Not Smash.

584
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,560
I almost played that this week.

585
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,820
Nick All-Stars.

586
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,880
How many...

588
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,580
Oh my goodness, how many intros are we getting?

589
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,120
Let's get it on.

590
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,720
Have you guys heard Spongebob recently?

591
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,520
Please, let my man rest.

592
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,170
His voice sounds so bad now.

593
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,690
Oh, it's so bad.

594
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:37,090
3000 miles to Shell City, sandwich driving 101, floating block... let's do the 3000 miles.

595
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:47,850
Like, I know some people's voices are going to change, especially with that kind of demanding type of voice, I feel.

596
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,150
Yeah, Tom Kenny, Tom Kenny, thank you.

597
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,770
But like, oh man, it sounds like he's just struggling.

598
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,110
It doesn't even sound like he's getting old, it just sounds like he's like...

599
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,090
kind of killed his...

600
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,790
Who is it talking to?

601
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,090
Who is talking to me?

602
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:14,570
Oh, the daughter!

603
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,970
It's the daughter of the king.

604
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:19,770
Yeah, yeah.

605
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,450
You have enough Goofy Goober Tokens, now I can teach you to use the Bash Moob.

606
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,920
Now I...

607
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,020
Oh, SpongeBob Gushajitama!

608
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,520
First triangle, now you can hit things directly above you.

609
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,300
I can't...

610
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,620
OK Oh no!

611
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,560
The desert?

612
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,280
I think that's not what you call that.

613
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:28,340
Why does he stick his finger up like that?

614
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,900
I'm the master now.

615
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,120
I'm crying,

616
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,420
this is so funny.

617
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, press R1.

618
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,780
Oh, this is Mindy.

619
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,020
This is... Hey Mindy.

620
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:01,160
I thought... I thought she didn't want to talk to us.

621
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,440
So true!

622
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,780
Oh god.

623
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,320
The camera...

624
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,120
Oh god.

625
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,120
Did you guys ever want to see SpongeBob's teeth?

626
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,360
Why are you walking like that?

627
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,500
Why is there like a drift?

628
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,580
SpongeBob please.

629
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,860
Wait, I think...

630
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,780
I think there is also inverted controls here.

631
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,720
No, no please.

632
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:37,480
No!

633
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,520
No!

634
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,460
No!

635
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,100
They all talk!

636
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,100
Is this really for the PS2?

637
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,760
Because the movie came out in 2015.

638
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:48,920
What?

639
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,620
No it didn't.

640
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,120
OK

641
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,300
Oh gosh, I thought the game crashed for a second.

642
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,160
He does his famous...

643
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,260
You like screwed up teeth, don't you Minto?

644
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,740
I actually unironically do.

645
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,600
It's my favorite thing.

646
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,220
Oh!

647
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:20,650
Oh!

648
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,750
What's happening?

649
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,170
OK, we can get this guy up his butt.

650
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,970
Just kidding.

651
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:27,930
Yeah!

652
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,630
That should take care of him.

653
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:30,450
Yeah!

654
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,310
Oh, we gotta collect Krabby Patty things.

655
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:37,050
Dumbbells.

656
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,370
How do I just...OK.

657
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:39,770
Alright, let's go.

658
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,210
We are men.

659
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:52,050
We are men.

660
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,030
Why did he say that?

661
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,080
I don't need a song.

662
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,440
I'll sing.

663
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,460
It's your birthday.

664
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,640
Happy birthday!

665
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,480
Happy birthday to you.

666
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,280
Happy birthday to you.

667
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,720
Happy birthday dear Milk.

668
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,080
Happy birthday to you.

669
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,160
Happy birthday.

670
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,320
I don't remember that in the movie.

671
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,120
There are some more boxes.

672
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,240
Guys, look how...Hi Spongebob.

673
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,540
Hi Spongebob.

674
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,580
We are so close to him.

675
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,800
Wait, how am I supposed to get that one right there without dying?

676
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,500
That guy came at me so crazy like...

677
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,560
Oh yeah.

678
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,520
Oh yeah.

679
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,560
Nice.

680
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,440
Where is Patrick?

681
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,840
He was here and now he's gone.

682
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,740
Why does he have all this stuff?

683
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,700
Why does Clank have all this in his...

684
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,760
in his little...in his boxes?

685
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,420
Oh gosh, now there are two of them.

686
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,100
Ouch!

687
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,120
Ouch!

688
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:42,650
Ouch!

689
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:45,150
Hey, where are you?

690
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,150
What does that mean?

691
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,530
I can't see anything.

692
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:50,990
Please.

693
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,790
We are taking care of them.

694
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:09,610
Wow, this is a pretty...

695
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,290
Oh maybe I can jump on top of these.

696
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:18,030
Oh, I thought I was to destroy them.

697
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,490
Wait, the P means you have earned your first upgrade point.

698
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,810
Whenever you see the P, press select.

699
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,090
Did you guys see a P?

700
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,330
Wait, there are things.

701
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,270
Press to upgrade.

702
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,670
Are you sure you want this upgrade?

703
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,290
Yeah?

704
00:42:54,700 --> 00:43:01,040
When upgraded, it allows Spongebob's Macho Karate Spin to reflect enemies' projectiles back at them.

705
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,320
Wow.

706
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,940
Hey, I thought I was supposed to be able to reflect your stuff back at you.

707
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,880
Something has been disconnecting from my computer today, so...

708
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,540
Just ignore.

709
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,700
Hopefully it's nothing.

710
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:33,050
What is that horrible sound?

711
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:39,790
I thought it was mine.

712
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,930
No, it's all me.

713
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,490
What's up there even?

714
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:51,070
The Chum Bucket doesn't serve Krabby Patties!

715
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:53,110
Not on my watch.

716
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:55,670
Oh my goodness.

717
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:01,390
Super Sponge!

718
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:01,830
Yeah!

719
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:09,110
You can only press this button by standing directly beneath it and pressing it.

720
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:14,830
What is that horrible sound?

721
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:16,630
Oh, is it this thing maybe?

722
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,210
How do I destroy it?

723
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:22,710
This thing.

724
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,710
Oh, this thing!

725
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:39,620
How convenient.

726
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,600
Peace and quiet.

727
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,560
Did I get all the stuff?

728
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,140
I think so.

729
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:55,830
What's that say?

730
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:57,770
Checkpoint?

731
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,970
What do you mean, checkpoint?

732
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:00,770
There's more?

733
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:02,630
Ouch.

734
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,320
We are so manly.

735
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,100
I bet if I jumped on those, I could find secret areas, but...

736
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,660
What?

737
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,140
You can even brainwash the jellyfish.

738
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:25,580
I know!

739
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,360
Ouch.

740
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:31,560
Yeah.

741
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,580
Demo secret areas.

742
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Yeah, they are really important.

743
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:39,480
Who's throwing that at me?

744
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:41,820
Who was that?

745
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,420
Are you guys throwing stuff at me?

746
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:50,840
No.

747
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:51,580
No.

748
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,600
They're so mean!

749
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,180
Oh, that's timed.

750
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,240
SpongeBob, don't drown!

751
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,060
SpongeBob, I can't see you!

752
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:08,800
Where are you?

753
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,200
My god, they don't stop laughing.

754
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:31,580
Like...

755
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:48,810
It sounds like they are joking on their own time.

756
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:50,130
What is this?

757
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,410
Come on, SpongeBob.

758
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,530
I need you to get up there.

759
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:54,130
Thank you, buddy.

760
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:57,510
Shut up!

761
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,810
Where do I go from here?

762
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:08,690
Oh gosh, I'm crying.

763
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,890
I can't concentrate!

764
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,590
They keep laughing at me!

765
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:25,790
How do I get to the other side?

766
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:35,030
Oh my gosh, I wish I could just tilt the camera down a little bit.

767
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,630
Shut up, please!

768
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:41,930
Please, shut up!

769
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,090
Oh my god!

770
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,330
I died!

771
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:53,110
Oh, good thing we had...

772
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:54,790
Oh, that's a headache waiting to happen.

773
00:47:57,230 --> 00:47:58,350
Oh my god.

774
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,650
I missed him.

775
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,430
There we go.

776
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,930
They're still going!

777
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,930
My stomach hurts.

778
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:19,970
They just wouldn't shut up.

779
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,630
Why would you program them like that?

780
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:33,290
Now we wait.

781
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:35,810
Nice.

782
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:43,230
I

783
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,030
wouldn't do programming.

784
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,750
Oh my god, even Plankton... Everybody just doesn't shut up in this game.

785
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,030
Holy cow!

786
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:02,810
I need more health.

787
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,490
This

788
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:19,840
thing is respawning now, I see.

789
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:20,940
Come here!

790
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:22,220
Hey!

791
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,240
Bouncy bouncy task.

792
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,160
I think I'm good.

793
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:39,390
Shut up, please!

794
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,190
What did he say?

795
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:43,070
Oh, I died again.

796
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:46,050
I thought he just said that he's pregnant.

797
00:49:53,970 --> 00:49:54,990
We're good on this.

798
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:56,890
Anyway.

799
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:04,990
There we go.

800
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:08,540
I'm done.

801
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,960
You guys are brainwashed!

802
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,020
You guys are brainwashed by the buckets.

803
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,760
You're brainwashed by the buckets.

804
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,540
Resist!

805
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,040
Resist!

806
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,660
Resist!

807
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,820
Checkpoint.

808
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,440
There's more?

809
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,980
How long is... This was only one of the missions, you guys.

810
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,180
This is such a long demo.

811
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:39,960
I

812
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:56,850
won't let you!

813
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,550
First ever super chat after my first trip to Japan.

814
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,170
The Japan episode helped me be way more prepared than I could have been.

815
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,050
Thanks for always post-firing.

816
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:07,890
Oh, genetic!

817
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,770
Thank you!

818
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:11,650
Thank you so much!

819
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,070
I'm glad I could help a little.

820
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,130
Oh we got... You're right!

821
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:20,910
We got a point!

822
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:23,370
Let's do the bash.

823
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,210
What do we do now?

824
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,910
Press the triangle to detonate the glove.

825
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:33,630
Wait, what do you mean?

826
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,610
Stick to things?

827
00:51:39,710 --> 00:51:41,630
This is like the longest demo.

828
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,490
I guess that's what you want though from a demo, no?

829
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:05,820
This is...

830
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,940
We stick it right up his butt!

831
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:11,930
Nice.

832
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:13,650
Good job everybody.

833
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:17,810
Oh, I missed literally every single one of those.

834
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,250
Which way do I go?

835
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,060
Oh, that's it everybody.

836
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:38,840
We played the game.

837
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,680
We beat the game.

838
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,680
Time's up!

839
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,880
Get out!

840
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,160
Get out!

841
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,190
Holy moly.

842
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,370
Maybe I should have done the Krabby Patty car.

843
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:03,360
Those guys laughing really killed me.

844
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,580
I think maybe I'll hold off on this one.

845
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,120
Just because I want to be able to play some of the other discs.

846
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,700
Let's play another disc.

847
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,390
Yeah.

848
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:30,510
I know that the series is pretty good though, right?

849
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:31,930
I've heard good things about it.

850
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:42,910
It's moving on it's own again.

851
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:44,130
Stop please.

852
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,810
I just picked a disc that... I didn't pick a random one.

853
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,050
I have one that doesn't have a sleeve.

854
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:05,470
It was like combined with another sleeve.

855
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,910
Oh wait, what if the... I don't remember which sleeve it was combined with though.

856
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,810
Actually, what if that one was the one that had what was written on the sleeve?

857
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:18,610
Now I don't know.

858
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:20,050
What?

859
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,390
Now I don't know.

860
00:54:22,490 --> 00:54:23,250
Secret disc.

861
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:24,730
What?

862
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:27,090
I don't know.

863
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,110
Yeah, this is real gotcha.

864
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:37,230
Oh I should be saying the last one we did was...

865
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,710
PlayStation Magazine issue 90.

866
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,850
We got baseball.

867
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,250
Get rekt!

868
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,500
We got a lot of baseball.

869
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,280
So that was the first disc.

870
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,220
How did it taste?

871
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,460
Have you guys ever licked one of the...

872
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:05,140
I feel like ever since they told everybody not to lick the Switch cartridges, everybody probably has licked it before now, right?

873
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,380
These demo discs introduced me and my brother to the best game of all time, Snake Eater.

874
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,180
I have that one, J-Rod.

875
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,020
I have it.

876
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:16,000
I have the Snake Eater one in here.

877
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,580
Right here.

878
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,160
You can't see it, but I'm looking at it right now.

879
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,000
What?

880
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:25,180
You haven't licked it.

881
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,040
You haven't licked the Switch.

882
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,500
Why is there so much baseball?

883
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,320
OK, I'm clicking out of it.

884
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,800
Issue 80.

885
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,920
We've got...

886
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,820
Track Gran Turismo 4.

887
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,860
OK, nevermind.

888
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,800
Let's go to the playground.

889
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:42,020
Playground.

890
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:45,840
You haven't tried it?

891
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:50,620
I got so curious because they said it tasted so bad.

892
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,280
And it did.

893
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,860
We have Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six 3.

894
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,200
Terminator 3 Redemption.

895
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,740
Fight Night 2004.

896
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,040
Fight Night at Freddy's.

897
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,320
Siphon Filter.

898
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,060
The Omega Strain.

899
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,600
Psy Girls.

900
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,760
Psy Ops.

901
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,640
Alias.

902
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:16,720
Hit... Wait a second.

903
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,450
One moment, please.

904
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:23,990
Please hold.

905
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:27,510
OK, no.

906
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:29,390
I have another game with Hitman.

907
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:32,730
I was wondering if that was the one that...

908
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,150
I have another disc with Hitman.

909
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:39,610
All-Star Baseball.

910
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,330
iToy Tech Demos.

911
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:43,910
And that's it.

912
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,190
What do you guys wanna...

913
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,950
What are we... What are we in the mood for?

914
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,030
Peace Combat with Psy Ops.

915
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:01,150
This one.

916
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:02,990
Mindgate Conspiracy.

917
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:07,170
Psy Girls.

918
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,430
OK, we can do Psy Ops and Psy Girls.

919
00:57:10,650 --> 00:57:12,650
Here's your man, Nick Scryer.

920
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:15,310
Facial reconstruction and a memory wipe.

921
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:19,750
Intelligence has the movement attacking the refinery in about 90 hours.

922
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,450
This memory wipe will give us plenty of time to drop him in...

923
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:23,170
Why do you sound like that?

924
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,210
His boobs are out.

925
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:28,250
Don't hug you too.

926
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:34,570
They dismissed General Krieger, but Scryer stayed with Mindgate and took his psychic powers to a new level.

927
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,570
Oh no!

928
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,090
Wow!

929
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,310
Remote viewing.

930
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,630
Mind control.

931
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,750
Telekinesis.

932
00:58:17,890 --> 00:58:19,090
I can't read this fine.

933
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,830
Psy Girls.

934
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:22,670
That's an MGS bootleg by Konami.

935
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:24,550
Made for... Made on...

936
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:27,570
Made on the MGS Fox Engine.

937
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:28,870
By Konami's Yuuki.

938
00:58:28,930 --> 00:58:29,350
Wait, what?

939
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:39,820
Psy Ops.

940
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,020
The Mindgate Conspiracy.

941
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,940
With my mind... Your mind is the ultimate weapon.

942
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:49,540
Oh, coming soon.

943
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,900
Oh, it's also midway.

944
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,960
Psy Ops is how I found out about one of my favorite bands, Cold.

945
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:58,140
What a nostalgia trip.

946
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,340
Oh, it was just a video.

947
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,000
No!

948
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,400
Try Psy Girls.

949
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,900
Here we go.

950
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,860
We can play this one.

951
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,140
Hide.

952
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:13,920
Evade.

953
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,080
Movement.

954
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:16,800
Jump.

955
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,420
Action.

956
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,280
Reload.

957
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,060
Main weapon.

958
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,440
Attack.

959
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,500
Secondary weapon.

960
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,320
I'm not going to remember any of these.

961
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,260
We got Psy Girls, baby.

962
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,700
Yeah, it was just a trailer.

963
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,180
Did it say that it was just a trailer?

964
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:46,350
Okay.

965
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:47,670
Konami.

966
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:49,850
Twice.

967
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,480
Nice.

968
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:09,080
Yeah.

969
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,460
Nice.

970
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,920
This is viewable and playable.

971
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,000
Ah, okay, okay.

972
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,120
I thought the viewable was something else.

973
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,300
Oh, yeah.

974
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:26,870
I saw a cheek!

975
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:28,410
I saw a cheek!

976
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:32,090
This looks really good.

977
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:35,070
Oh, yeah.

978
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:37,090
Oh, yeah!

979
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:40,690
Psy Girls.

980
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,190
Oh my god, it's so stretched.

981
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:47,930
Might be my resolution.

982
01:00:48,070 --> 01:00:49,050
That might be my fault.

983
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,230
You can selected her.

984
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:53,790
Oh, sorry.

985
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:01,050
Sorry.

986
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:04,570
It's not... It's... It's me.

987
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,530
I read it wrong.

988
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:09,990
I thought it was saying you can select a girl.

989
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,130
You selected her.

990
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,010
No, I didn't.

991
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,630
Asuka is not available.

992
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:21,550
We have to go with ice.

993
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,630
Ice, ice, baby.

994
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:27,790
I will free camera it.

995
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:28,330
Thank you.

996
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,550
Ice, ice, baby.

997
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:35,430
You can selected her.

998
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,010
No!

999
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,500
I don't know where I got the can from.

1000
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:46,680
I just inserted it with my brain.

1001
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,820
Your mind is the greatest weapon.

1002
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,900
Hello?

1003
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:02,050
Hello?

1004
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,130
Hello?

1005
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,120
It's just loading guys.

1006
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:12,920
It's just loading.

1007
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,680
Hello?

1008
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,200
Uh-oh.

1009
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,160
It might have died.

1010
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,780
It might have died.

1011
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,340
I think it died.

1012
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:48,440
Well, this disc didn't have so much good stuff.

1013
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:51,600
I think maybe so.

1014
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,560
My Yoshi does all the peak streams.

1015
01:02:58,820 --> 01:02:59,980
Yeah, I guess we...

1016
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,380
Oh,

1017
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,240
this one is actually pretty scuffed up.

1018
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,680
I didn't check it beforehand.

1019
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,160
Thank you.

1020
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,180
Playstation Magazine issue 80 demo disc.

1021
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,040
Thank you for nothing.

1022
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,060
Thank you for nothing.

1023
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,080
Let's see.

1024
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:22,800
I'm going to pick...

1025
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,170
Let's pick another one at random.

1026
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,010
You can't selected her.

1027
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:33,850
John Cena.

1028
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,150
Where is John?

1029
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:36,990
Why we have John Cena?

1030
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:43,010
Okay, I'm picking one at random and it's...

1031
01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:44,230
This one!

1032
01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:52,630
This one has something I wanted to see.

1033
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,190
Wait, this one doesn't feel like it's been opened.

1034
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:05,490
It barely has any scratches on it at all.

1035
01:04:11,270 --> 01:04:12,210
It's beauty.

1036
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:13,870
Yeah, we got a nice fresh one.

1037
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:22,190
I'm going to need you guys to choose what game we...

1038
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:25,670
There are some replay stuff in here, but we can't...

1039
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,950
Replay is only if you have the game, no?

1040
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,110
Extra special.

1041
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:32,110
There is a hidden demo in this.

1042
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:33,390
How do we get it?

1043
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:35,750
How do we get the hidden demo?

1044
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:44,250
So we have here Playstation Magazine issue disc 105.

1045
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:54,940
Let's go to...

1046
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:03,130
Why?

1047
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:09,500
I think this is just a video, no?

1048
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,020
Sometimes these are pretty funny.

1049
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,340
Belkan War

1050
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:41,140
Belkan War We've awakened Nan.

1051
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:44,940
Nice game in this game.

1052
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:56,780
I think this is just a trailer.

1053
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,840
I think it's just like a...

1054
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,280
But I kind of like the behind the scenes stuff.

1055
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,700
Calm down.

1056
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,120
Shoot down all enemy bombers.

1057
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,300
Don't let them get close.

1058
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,120
Come on baby.

1059
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:16,940
Sneak!

1060
01:06:18,060 --> 01:06:20,180
My favorite elegant.

1061
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:29,300
I want to play.

1062
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,380
Dog fights!

1063
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:36,360
New features.

1064
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:40,360
Yes, the trilogy stream win.

1065
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,280
I definitely have Ace Combat.

1066
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:47,480
We will play Ace Combat this year.

1067
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,080
Oh no.

1068
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:51,520
Oh no.

1069
01:06:56,560 --> 01:07:03,760
It's so jarring hearing this commentary over something I remember is so intense.

1070
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,600
It's so chill.

1071
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:10,280
A CEO.

1072
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,880
His glasses are so small.

1073
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:42,760
Now, there are dog fights and then there are dog fights.

1074
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,760
You have to change your inflection buddy for that to make sense.

1075
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,480
Dog fights.

1076
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,600
Now there are dog fights and then there are dog fights.

1077
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,880
AI before AI.

1078
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,280
I know.

1079
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:05,640
Dog fights.

1080
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:09,040
You have to change your perspective for playing.

1081
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:10,380
Press R3.

1082
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:11,100
That's it.

1083
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:11,420
Good luck.

1084
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:12,780
There are no controls.

1085
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,740
I can't play here.

1086
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,280
But thank you.

1087
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,260
Tell me that later.

1088
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:24,300
It's me!

1089
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,080
How old is this?

1090
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:33,760
Versus?

1091
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,700
It's probably not online though.

1092
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,080
2006?

1093
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,240
2004?

1094
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,260
Mid 2000.

1095
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,060
I think it said 2006.

1096
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:55,220
Salmon Ping?

1097
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:00,680
What?

1098
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,460
I'm confused.

1099
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:10,980
Wait, what?

1100
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:14,820
Huh?

1101
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:24,080
Please show me a cutscene right now.

1102
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,140
I need to see a cutscene right now.

1103
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,360
I want to play but there is no online.

1104
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,860
Use real actors?

1105
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,700
I need to see it.

1106
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,000
I can't wait to play.

1107
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,200
He said it!

1108
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,860
Hey buddy, you still alive?

1109
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:04,400
He said the thing!

1110
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:11,100
Nice That was a good video.

1111
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,380
What else we got in here?

1112
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,040
Siphon Filter.

1113
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:15,720
Rampage.

1114
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:16,800
These are all videos.

1115
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:19,780
Then we have extras.

1116
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:21,560
Which are the credits.

1117
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,160
But also...

1118
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:28,580
So what we can play is Hitman Blood Money.

1119
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,540
Mark Echoes Getting Up.

1120
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,220
Stimbot Chronicles.

1121
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:36,860
I like how this looks already.

1122
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,400
MLB06.

1123
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,020
Neo Contra.

1124
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:41,760
Oh Neo Contra.

1125
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:42,180
OK.

1126
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:45,680
Maximo vs.

1127
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,780
Army of Zin.

1128
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,700
R-Type Final.

1129
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,500
Real World Golf?

1130
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,400
I kind of want to play that.

1131
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:05,170
Sorry, I pressed it so fast.

1132
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:09,130
I pressed it so fast.

1133
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,520
Somewhere in the Western United States.

1134
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,080
That's close enough.

1135
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,600
Kill the lights and radio.

1136
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,360
I can't read it.

1137
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,060
It's so...

1138
01:11:34,450 --> 01:11:35,050
Rex.

1139
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,250
We'll approach.

1140
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:38,510
Oh, it's so fast.

1141
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:41,830
We'll launch a one man STV.

1142
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:44,870
That's him.

1143
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,310
Don't worry, that suit represents the latest advance...

1144
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:52,310
We had new tropics...

1145
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:54,670
Oh yes, the nanomachines!

1146
01:11:55,330 --> 01:11:57,330
I know this dialogue!

1147
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:58,770
I know...

1148
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:00,150
Sorry.

1149
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,850
Liquid.

1150
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,650
Bang, bang, bang!

1151
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,990
Bang, bang, bang!

1152
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,160
It's the best part of the comic.

1153
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:21,760
Liquid.

1154
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:29,610
The comic is going too fast and it's out of order.

1155
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:34,550
Behind me!

1156
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:39,670
Sniper Wolf.

1157
01:12:40,190 --> 01:12:41,530
Oh Vulcan Raven.

1158
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:42,170
Bye bye.

1159
01:12:43,570 --> 01:12:44,690
Working title.

1160
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:54,420
Did you guys get that?

1161
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,180
Did you guys get that?

1162
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,220
Did you guys get all that?

1163
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:12,390
Come over and play these old school games with me.

1164
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:16,490
Yeah, let's have a party.

1165
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:21,570
I'm gonna do an Ace Combat reference.

1166
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:23,430
Tomorrow is my birthday.

1167
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:25,490
A victory sure would be nice.

1168
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:29,350
But it's not actually your birthday, is it?

1169
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:30,550
We got Sleep Coden.

1170
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,890
This is also a video though.

1171
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,250
Oh wait, Hitman Blood Money is a video.

1172
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,930
I'm just one peace walker.

1173
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:49,080
Should we try Neo Contra?

1174
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,120
It is your birthday tomorrow.

1175
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:54,720
Oh my gosh, dad!

1176
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:56,540
Should we wait for tomorrow?

1177
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:00,520
Do it.

1178
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:01,780
This is Contra hard.

1179
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:08,230
Use a weapon.

1180
01:14:08,550 --> 01:14:10,390
Oh use a lock on weapon.

1181
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:11,070
Switch weapon.

1182
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:12,690
How do I use?

1183
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,490
Oh use equip standard weapon.

1184
01:14:16,230 --> 01:14:19,410
Nah, I've never played Contra before.

1185
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:24,650
I've never played it.

1186
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:29,410
It's hard core.

1187
01:14:32,610 --> 01:14:34,290
Nah, not even the old ones.

1188
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:37,070
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

1189
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:38,550
Thank you.

1190
01:14:41,530 --> 01:14:44,070
AD 4... That's a spooky number.

1191
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:45,930
I'm gonna be busy tomorrow.

1192
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:49,030
I'll do it now after the cutscene.

1193
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:02,060
Oh my god!

1194
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,000
Dinosaurs!

1195
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:06,200
Bill Rizzler.

1196
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,560
Jaguar.

1197
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:21,030
Wait, this is awesome.

1198
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,380
That's sick.

1199
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:40,650
Was this song in DDR?

1200
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:41,790
I feel like it should be.

1201
01:15:46,970 --> 01:15:48,310
Look at their legs.

1202
01:15:53,300 --> 01:15:55,020
Or 2DX or something.

1203
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,320
2DX is Konami, right?

1204
01:15:58,820 --> 01:15:59,420
Am I crazy?

1205
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:03,540
Adrenaline pumping action.

1206
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:04,620
When do I get to play?

1207
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:06,560
It said it was a demo.

1208
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:29,410
We get the full song.

1209
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:43,300
Pretty ladies.

1210
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:56,430
My eyes.

1211
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,830
No!

1212
01:17:04,350 --> 01:17:05,590
He said it!

1213
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:07,330
Mr. Contra!

1214
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,270
It's still going.

1215
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:12,150
Do we get to play the game?

1216
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,580
I don't care.

1217
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:20,200
I didn't want to say it, but you guys said it.

1218
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:46,340
That was awesome!

1219
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:51,310
OK.

1220
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:54,370
Happy birthday to you!

1221
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,230
Happy birthday to you!

1222
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,210
Happy birthday dear Non!

1223
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:04,990
Happy birthday to you!

1224
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:07,530
Happy birthday!

1225
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,890
A demo with two players.

1226
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,990
I should have maybe done the tutorial.

1227
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:17,710
Type 1.

1228
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,270
Charge shot.

1229
01:18:21,610 --> 01:18:22,950
Spread shot.

1230
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:24,930
Let's do the machine gun.

1231
01:18:31,530 --> 01:18:32,810
Oh my god!

1232
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:37,430
This is insane.

1233
01:18:37,790 --> 01:18:38,610
Oh my gosh, the bloom.

1234
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:41,290
The bloom is crazy.

1235
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:44,410
I hide like a ghost you are.

1236
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:00,000
How do I shoot?

1237
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:01,440
Wait, I was shooting.

1238
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:02,960
My dinosaur!

1239
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:04,620
Wait, I was shooting.

1240
01:19:04,620 --> 01:19:05,180
There it is.

1241
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,120
OK, switch to...

1242
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,300
Oh, this is the machine gun.

1243
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:10,000
OK, here we go.

1244
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:11,120
Bye!

1245
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,640
Run little lizard!

1246
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,050
There is like a third weapon.

1247
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,550
Maybe that?

1248
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:18,790
What did I just do?

1249
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:21,790
Oh, I think that locks...

1250
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:24,310
Ah, I see.

1251
01:20:26,270 --> 01:20:27,470
I see, I see, I see.

1252
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:38,700
Nice.

1253
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,280
Nice.

1254
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:45,600
I don't know if I'm hitting him or not, but...

1255
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,300
What the hell are you?

1256
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,300
Stop throwing your cargo.

1257
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:06,500
Let's go.

1258
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:09,200
This

1259
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,230
is kind of fun.

1260
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:24,070
I see how this works.

1261
01:21:24,610 --> 01:21:25,270
Kind of.

1262
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:33,100
Yeah!

1263
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,960
You are going down buddy!

1264
01:21:45,820 --> 01:21:48,540
How do you deal with post Japan depression?

1265
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:51,840
I don't know.

1266
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:53,780
How do I deal with my normal depression?

1267
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,240
I think I got to crawl.

1268
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:07,280
I think I got to go.

1269
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,960
I think I got to get out of here.

1270
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:22,260
What am I doing here?

1271
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:25,920
Is it going to blow up that guy?

1272
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,740
I think I just got to keep running though.

1273
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:34,810
I'm a little confused.

1274
01:22:36,450 --> 01:22:37,290
Oh, I died.

1275
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:39,610
Nevermind.

1276
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,670
I'm just going to keep going up.

1277
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:45,650
More rockets?

1278
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:46,150
Maybe.

1279
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:57,930
What the

1280
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,440
hell is this thing?

1281
01:23:09,950 --> 01:23:12,070
The music is so casual.

1282
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:24,640
Nice.

1283
01:23:33,530 --> 01:23:35,150
Please, Mr. John Contra.

1284
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:36,750
There we go.

1285
01:23:37,790 --> 01:23:38,510
There we go.

1286
01:23:38,570 --> 01:23:38,850
There we go.

1287
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:39,510
Nice, nice, nice.

1288
01:23:43,370 --> 01:23:45,390
He's got that doki bird now.

1289
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:00,910
I'm learning!

1290
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,330
D for...

1291
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:05,130
Damn!

1292
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,750
D

1293
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,200
for degrees?

1294
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,820
I don't think we're getting any degrees.

1295
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:25,000
Are there any other things?

1296
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,120
I kind of want to see real world golf.

1297
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:27,640
Is that OK?

1298
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,240
That looks like a real man.

1299
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,860
Like green screened in.

1300
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,400
Golf.

1301
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:41,120
It's not a real man.

1302
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:46,280
There's a lot happening here.

1303
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,240
Wait, it's a real world... That is a real man!

1304
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,340
They turned up the brightness to 100.

1305
01:24:57,460 --> 01:24:58,260
He has no feet.

1306
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:00,860
Revolutionary...

1307
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,660
Put every aspect of your swing into the game.

1308
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,320
It's so high technology.

1309
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:18,540
Ten stunning 18-hole golf courses.

1310
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,120
Championship mode, career mode.

1311
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:23,580
Oh, he's judging.

1312
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,480
Look at the booty.

1313
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:29,120
If only golf was real.

1314
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,800
Improve your game with video tutorials.

1315
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:35,700
My eyes, every time they switch to this other screen.

1316
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,480
Golf club for real golf action.

1317
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,080
Cool!

1318
01:25:52,190 --> 01:25:54,280
Just swing to play.

1319
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:57,200
God, they gave this guy a huge dumpy though.

1320
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,820
On the green.

1321
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:03,900
Most realistic and exciting golf game ever!

1322
01:26:15,400 --> 01:26:16,000
Wow!

1323
01:26:16,580 --> 01:26:17,980
I didn't realize it was a video.

1324
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:29,240
It's the most... It's the bestest golf game there ever has existed!

1325
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:37,730
Get in, stream it with 3D.

1326
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:45,080
My new 3D is almost done actually.

1327
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:47,080
Actually.

1328
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,840
But I want to have a debut stream for it, so...

1329
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,520
But I saw it yesterday.

1330
01:26:53,680 --> 01:26:54,500
I was like...

1331
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:55,700
Wow!

1332
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,940
It looks so good.

1333
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:01,680
It looks so, so good.

1334
01:27:06,580 --> 01:27:07,200
Sheena!

1335
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,840
Thank you for the raid!

1336
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,160
Hello, hello everybody.

1337
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:12,200
Hello, hello, hello.

1338
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,900
Are we good with this disc?

1339
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:18,260
Today we're going through...

1340
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:21,220
Wait, do you guys want to watch the Hitman movie?

1341
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:26,540
Today we're going through PlayStation Magazine demo discs.

1342
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:30,280
R-Type please.

1343
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:31,260
Oh, where is R-Type?

1344
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:34,320
Oh, R-Type Final.

1345
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,040
What is this?

1346
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,080
I

1347
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,980
can't argue about the realism, but it's not Neo Turf Masters.

1348
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,400
We'll just... We got this.

1349
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:58,680
Yeah, maybe we'll do golfing.

1350
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,680
Maybe we'll do... What's it called?

1351
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,040
I got to get whatever that thing was.

1352
01:28:04,100 --> 01:28:05,380
This game is currently under development.

1353
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:06,740
Oh, minor problems?

1354
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,060
I hope there's no problems.

1355
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,720
That was...

1356
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:13,900
Real world golf.

1357
01:28:13,940 --> 01:28:15,520
I got to get the thing for it too.

1358
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:25,840
Oh, I can't read that.

1359
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,260
Irem software?

1360
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,140
It's so... Oh my gosh.

1361
01:28:34,740 --> 01:28:35,800
R-Type Final.

1362
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,300
It's so bright.

1363
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:39,240
Invisible Moose!

1364
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:40,420
Thank you so much for the 10 gifts!

1365
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:44,820
Oh no!

1366
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:45,440
The people!

1367
01:28:50,220 --> 01:28:51,380
Everybody is dead.

1368
01:28:55,950 --> 01:28:57,030
What type of game is this?

1369
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:00,730
Macross.

1370
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:03,050
Shooting star.

1371
01:29:07,070 --> 01:29:08,550
It's a shmup!

1372
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:09,510
Oh no.

1373
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:15,510
I see.

1374
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:20,490
I see.

1375
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:31,280
I love all these intros.

1376
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,180
These game intros.

1377
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,380
Here, I'm going to pick out what disc we do next.

1378
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,520
Just so that I'm ready.

1379
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:39,740
I'm not looking.

1380
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:40,420
I'm not looking.

1381
01:29:40,520 --> 01:29:41,160
I'm not looking.

1382
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:41,940
I'm not looking.

1383
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:45,380
There's so many!

1384
01:29:45,740 --> 01:29:46,840
That one is a little classic.

1385
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:03,720
Shot a par in a tournament.

1386
01:30:04,100 --> 01:30:07,780
Some 4th grader hit an eagle and that's why I retired from exciting golfing.

1387
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:13,800
Here we go!

1388
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:16,900
I guess I'll just learn as we go.

1389
01:30:20,260 --> 01:30:20,900
Oh!

1390
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:23,620
I thought eagle was a golf term.

1391
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:29,800
I was like, like a turkey or...

1392
01:30:30,640 --> 01:30:32,740
You know in... Oh it is.

1393
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:36,140
Why did you guys say poor bird?

1394
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,560
Oh it's a high score.

1395
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,560
Oh my...

1396
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,320
I was like, damn that kid has the best aim ever.

1397
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,420
He hit an eagle.

1398
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,720
Let's go with the orange one.

1399
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:01,770
He hit an eagle and an eagle.

1400
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:09,250
You should watch Birdie Wing.

1401
01:31:09,370 --> 01:31:09,830
I know.

1402
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:14,830
Birdie Wing was the hot stuff.

1403
01:31:15,190 --> 01:31:18,270
Basking in the summer sun, I greeted the seabirds.

1404
01:31:18,270 --> 01:31:20,410
But then I entered the demon's den.

1405
01:31:23,670 --> 01:31:24,710
Hi birds!

1406
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:25,910
Bye birds!

1407
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,620
I'm already killing it.

1408
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,040
I'm already crazy.

1409
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,200
Wait, what is that?

1410
01:31:44,240 --> 01:31:45,280
It's attached to my butt.

1411
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:51,660
Oh my gosh, it's been so long since I played a shmup.

1412
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,460
They're dumping their garbage on me.

1413
01:31:58,440 --> 01:32:00,550
I don't know why I'm playing with a...

1414
01:32:05,460 --> 01:32:07,740
I was playing with the D-pad.

1415
01:32:07,940 --> 01:32:08,600
I don't know why.

1416
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:24,880
There's no music.

1417
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,500
It's so quiet.

1418
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:29,540
Thank you.

1419
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:33,260
Are there like bombs or anything in this?

1420
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:37,480
Can I bomb when there's an attack so that I get...

1421
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,800
He didn't even get the...

1422
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,420
He's doing unprecedented...

1423
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,860
He's here!

1424
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:10,990
OK, I got him.

1425
01:33:10,990 --> 01:33:12,030
And...

1426
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:12,770
He

1427
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,220
only shoots three times and then he...

1428
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:33,880
I got him!

1429
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:39,790
I'm zapping everywhere.

1430
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,430
I'm hitting the wall.

1431
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:49,000
I can't really...

1432
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,680
There's nothing here.

1433
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,360
That's me!

1434
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:57,720
We have credits?

1435
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:57,880
What?

1436
01:34:02,760 --> 01:34:04,140
Wait, I have to start over?

1437
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:05,140
OK, thank goodness.

1438
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,720
No, I lost all my power-ups.

1439
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:13,720
I can get him back.

1440
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:14,800
I can get him back.

1441
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,400
I can get him back.

1442
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:16,040
I can get him back.

1443
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:16,620
I can get him back.

1444
01:34:23,290 --> 01:34:24,630
What the hell is this thing?

1445
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:29,070
It's a crab!

1446
01:34:30,030 --> 01:34:31,370
It's so cute!

1447
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:37,470
Maybe I should be up here.

1448
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:40,970
Because I'm trying to throw these little bombs.

1449
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:45,410
It's releasing its seed.

1450
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:48,210
The fish eggs.

1451
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:54,300
Eat

1452
01:34:58,260 --> 01:34:58,960
that.

1453
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,100
Oh, I have a little special thing now.

1454
01:35:05,690 --> 01:35:06,890
Can I turn around?

1455
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:10,890
It's so quiet.

1456
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:36,520
Is this my thing?

1457
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:37,560
Oh, this is my thing.

1458
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:47,400
Now I have stuff that is hitting behind me.

1459
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:48,240
So that's good.

1460
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,380
How do I know what damage I'm doing to him?

1461
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,940
It's here in the head.

1462
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:00,160
Back up.

1463
01:36:00,260 --> 01:36:00,680
Back it up.

1464
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:01,260
Back it up.

1465
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:01,780
Back it up.

1466
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:02,340
Back it up.

1467
01:36:08,620 --> 01:36:09,860
No, he's not dead.

1468
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:16,390
Grab that guy.

1469
01:36:19,110 --> 01:36:20,950
I didn't see it coming out.

1470
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:25,820
I think I'm good though.

1471
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:30,080
I think I'm good.

1472
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:33,960
I want to get to the next disc I think.

1473
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,020
I like SHMUP.

1474
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:40,820
Gosh, it's been a long time since I've played one though.

1475
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:48,240
Let me put this one away.

1476
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:52,360
Let's put this disc away.

1477
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:52,520
Okay,

1478
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:04,440
there was a birthday.

1479
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:05,560
Hold on.

1480
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,560
Oh gosh, there was so much happening and I was SHMUPing it up.

1481
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,400
What did I miss?

1482
01:37:12,140 --> 01:37:13,160
What did I miss?

1483
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:15,960
Getting a new shoulder tomorrow.

1484
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:17,660
Oh my gosh, good luck bandit!

1485
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,440
Holy moly, whose birthday did I miss?

1486
01:37:20,780 --> 01:37:21,180
Poseidon!

1487
01:37:22,180 --> 01:37:25,020
Happy birthday to you.

1488
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:28,100
Happy birthday to you.

1489
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:32,120
Happy birthday dear Poseidon.

1490
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:36,100
Happy birthday to you.

1491
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:38,660
Happy birthday.

1492
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:43,040
Okay, I picked our new disc.

1493
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:46,300
I picked our new disc.

1494
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,240
I'm excited for this one because of what's on the cover of it.

1495
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,080
I hope we get another Bugs Life.

1496
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:56,660
Please another Bugs Life situation.

1497
01:37:56,780 --> 01:37:59,000
Please another Bugs Life situation.

1498
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:02,560
And I restart.

1499
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:13,640
Bugs Life was special.

1500
01:38:13,880 --> 01:38:15,360
Oh my gosh, it was so good.

1501
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:22,500
That ending screen was worth every ounce of frustration that I got from that demo.

1502
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:28,400
But it was so good.

1503
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:33,280
What do we have on here?

1504
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:34,280
Oh my gosh!

1505
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:37,820
I just realized something else that's on here.

1506
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:38,880
I'm so sorry everybody.

1507
01:38:40,040 --> 01:38:41,520
I'm so sorry everybody.

1508
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,220
Your city is under attack!

1509
01:38:46,140 --> 01:38:50,640
We are on disc 106.

1510
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,500
Real lighting.

1511
01:38:54,040 --> 01:38:55,200
Chaos reigns.

1512
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:00,960
The burners...

1513
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:07,200
R -Type's boss level features people having...

1514
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:17,460
The people are wondering, you are Nick Mason.

1515
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,680
Who are you?

1516
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,660
You are Nick Mason.

1517
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:23,180

1518
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:27,700
Your mission.

1519
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,600
What's your mission?

1520
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:34,480
It's to take your city back.

1521
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,060
How old are you?

1522
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,380
Are you single?

1523
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,380
The city needs a savior.

1524
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:56,280
Urban Chaos.

1525
01:39:57,060 --> 01:40:00,280

1526
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,500
Wow, it will be 20 years old next year.

1527
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,100
I wonder if that... Does that link still work?

1528
01:40:09,780 --> 01:40:14,160
urbanchaosgame.com 20 years.

1529
01:40:29,180 --> 01:40:34,070
Everybody, I'm so sorry.

1530
01:40:36,730 --> 01:40:38,870
I can't wait to play cars.

1531
01:40:40,570 --> 01:40:41,730

1532
01:40:41,810 --> 01:40:42,930

1542
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:24,740

X3 the Official Game.

1545
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,100

Anime?

1549
01:41:44,590 --> 01:41:45,870
Let's just get it out of the way.

1550
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:47,830
OK guys, let's just get it out of the way.

1551
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:49,610
I'm sorry.

1552
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:51,870
Let's just get it out of the way.

1553
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:55,070
I want to play cars though.

1554
01:41:55,430 --> 01:41:56,530
Pad Vibration.

1555
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:58,290
To exit game.

1556
01:41:58,690 --> 01:41:59,610
Excuse me.

1557
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:03,870
L1, L2, R1, R2, Start, Select.

1558
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:06,130
OK, I have to press every button on my controller.

1559
01:42:08,190 --> 01:42:13,550
I know, I'm so curious how far we get to in the demo.

1560
01:42:15,670 --> 01:42:17,130
I'm so curious.

1561
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:20,550
Yeah, we just do the reset code to get out of the game.

1562
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:35,740
Trial version.

1563
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:39,300
Even the music is different.

1564
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:49,290
The demo that the Delta title screen is based on.

1565
01:42:57,270 --> 01:42:59,810
Are we going to witness the Halo jump?

1566
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:08,470
X3 the movie, the game, the video.

1567
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:10,550
Akio Otsuka?

1568
01:43:11,030 --> 01:43:11,270
Wait.

1569
01:43:13,310 --> 01:43:15,010
So wait, is it a Japanese dub?

1570
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:18,810
I remember buying that Guilty Gear game when I was in college.

1571
01:43:18,930 --> 01:43:19,610
I feel sick.

1572
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,780
Akio Otsuka.

1573
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:28,060
I keep going.

1574
01:43:28,180 --> 01:43:29,780
No way!

1575
01:43:31,740 --> 01:43:32,160
Nihongo!

1576
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:34,020
Nihongo!

1577
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:34,160
Ah!

1578
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:49,680
Good!

1579
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:01,560
Oh!

1580
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,440
Is this a Stickmin reference?

1581
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:15,780
Yeah, absolutely.

1582
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:37,490
I like how this is just showing the opening cutscene.

1583
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:41,710
The other ones all kind of showed cool videos.

1584
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:44,710
I mean, this is the coolest video, but...

1585
01:44:45,690 --> 01:44:50,810
Oh my god, Halo jump.

1586
01:44:51,510 --> 01:45:04,190
Am I blocking the subtitles?

1587
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:04,990
Sorry.

1588
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:26,500
Stand up!

1589
01:45:37,620 --> 01:45:39,900
I'm moving to the rear.

1590
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:46,480
The world's first Halo jump!

1591
01:45:57,980 --> 01:46:02,700
Be a bird!

1592
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:03,940
Yeah!

1593
01:46:07,340 --> 01:46:08,040
Why

1594
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:23,060
is he so stiff?

1595
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:51,120
I imagine Delta will probably be able to choose Japanese with English subtitles.

1596
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:55,860
So that would be really awesome.

1597
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:58,680
Though I think I'll still probably stick with the dub.

1598
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:06,750
It's like the rare times where I stick with the dub.

1599
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:14,870
Oh, it is David Hayter.

1600
01:47:15,030 --> 01:47:16,090
It is 100%.

1601
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:17,170
It's all the same.

1602
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:18,790
They didn't even re-record it.

1603
01:47:19,390 --> 01:47:20,730
It's the original dub.

1604
01:47:21,730 --> 01:47:22,730
So...

1605
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:25,610
He's in the changing room.

1606
01:47:55,850 --> 01:47:58,210
I love Akio Otsuka's voice, though!

1607
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:02,690
He sounds so...

1608
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:07,350
Thank you so much for the tag!

1609
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:08,790
Thank you!

1610
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,050
Colton, where would we...

1611
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:20,010
I wonder how much of this video we're going to see.

1612
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:21,830
Or how much of the intro.

1613
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,030
I don't know what to do.

1614
01:48:41,170 --> 01:48:42,130
The entire

1615
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:53,490
game is on the demo.

1616
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:56,530
We get to play the whole thing!

1617
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:00,330
I don't know.

1618
01:49:00,550 --> 01:49:02,070
I feel like maybe...

1619
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:04,810
To Sokolov?

1620
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:05,690
Is that too long?

1621
01:49:05,970 --> 01:49:06,750
I don't know.

1622
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,140
Do the thing Snake!

1623
01:49:27,500 --> 01:49:28,080
Look up!

1624
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,040
Look at me!

1625
01:49:42,220 --> 01:49:43,820
Wow, Russian Jungle.

1626
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,520
This is so awesome.

1627
01:49:48,700 --> 01:49:50,740
Imagine playing this demo and you're just like...

1628
01:49:50,740 --> 01:49:53,620
It's so cinematic and...

1629
01:49:53,620 --> 01:49:54,240
Everything.

1630
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,740
I can't get over it.

1631
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,640
I sometimes am so jealous of people that got to play...

1632
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:06,220
Got to play Metal Gear in their childhood.

1633
01:50:08,060 --> 01:50:10,800
I wish I had known about it forever now.

1634
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,220
You're so thick.

1635
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,680
It's Mint's husband.

1636
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,120
Don't say that!

1637
01:50:18,860 --> 01:50:20,260
We're not married yet.

1638
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:22,860
Not yet.

1639
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:29,600
The interface!

1640
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:33,200
We get to see all of Snake!

1641
01:50:34,020 --> 01:50:35,220
Oh my gosh, without the filter.

1642
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:44,840
Sorry, I just pressed it.

1643
01:50:45,100 --> 01:50:46,100
I'm gonna skip through it though.

1644
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:47,340
We know all this info.

1645
01:50:53,080 --> 01:50:54,120
Thank goodness.

1646
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:55,640
You scared me!

1647
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,260
Wait, what else?

1648
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:01,780
We don't have our backpack yet.

1649
01:51:03,100 --> 01:51:03,820
Oh god!

1650
01:51:03,980 --> 01:51:04,400
Oh no!

1651
01:51:04,760 --> 01:51:05,600
It's the old camera.

1652
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:06,540
Oh no!

1653
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:09,460
It's the old camera.

1654
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:15,200
Not yet, Mint.

1655
01:51:16,260 --> 01:51:17,420
Yeah, not yet.

1656
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,560
Not yet.

1657
01:51:30,240 --> 01:51:30,680
Oopsie.

1658
01:51:30,940 --> 01:51:31,280
My bad.

1659
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,540
Just started MGS3 and OMG it's so good!

1660
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:36,460
Yeah!

1661
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:37,900
It is!

1662
01:51:40,340 --> 01:51:43,020
Even the call sound sounds a little different, no?

1663
01:51:48,290 --> 01:51:49,540
I'm on it!

1664
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:51,860
Why are you...stop!

1665
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:55,660
Shut up!

1666
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:57,840
Zero, I'm getting it.

1667
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,280
Literally right now.

1668
01:52:14,120 --> 01:52:15,680
That's different.

1669
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:16,420
Backpack.

1670
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,240
OK, we know all this.

1671
01:52:24,680 --> 01:52:25,020
Oh wait.

1672
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,500
Oh no!

1673
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:29,560
I wanted to hear the voices.

1674
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:30,200
My bad.

1675
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:33,600
Sorry, I'm just gonna codec call them.

1676
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:40,320
It's OK, I can...

1677
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:51,320
Say the thing, Snake.

1678
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,720
Does he throw up in this?

1679
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:16,670
Oh, sorry.

1680
01:53:16,810 --> 01:53:18,510
I was like why is it...

1681
01:53:21,310 --> 01:53:22,610
Does it give me the option?

1682
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:23,330
Oh R1.

1683
01:53:23,530 --> 01:53:23,950
There we go.

1684
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:28,430
This is the most important thing.

1685
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:30,150
Always check if he throws up.

1686
01:53:32,330 --> 01:53:34,810
It's always important to check if he throws up.

1687
01:53:38,530 --> 01:53:40,950
Oh no, I'm starting to do the...

1688
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:43,990
He does!

1689
01:53:44,050 --> 01:53:44,930
Even in the demo!

1690
01:53:50,310 --> 01:53:51,350
He does!

1691
01:53:51,450 --> 01:53:52,470
Even in the demo!

1692
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:56,830
Amazing!

1693
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:08,640
They were like, this is very important.

1694
01:54:09,160 --> 01:54:15,180
So now in both demos that I've played of MGS3, he's thrown up.

1695
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:17,120
Isn't that just so special?

1696
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,720
Since I played the Delta demo.

1697
01:54:26,980 --> 01:54:28,720
And then...

1698
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:33,720
Look at that crocodile.

1699
01:54:35,380 --> 01:54:37,380
Look at that crocodile.

1700
01:54:39,060 --> 01:54:40,780
Look at that crocodile.

1701
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:42,200
Good night.

1702
01:54:44,720 --> 01:54:45,800
Come here crocodile.

1703
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:47,920
Did I get him?

1704
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:53,860
Is he asleep?

1705
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:00,160
Crocodile.

1706
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,820
I'm going to speedrun, or attempt to speedrun through this a little bit.

1707
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,420
Any bug juice here?

1708
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:11,460
Bug juice?

1709
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:12,260
Hot dog!

1710
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:13,220
Hot dog indeed!

1711
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:15,160
Look at that.

1712
01:55:15,220 --> 01:55:16,180
Wait, can we see the snakes?

1713
01:55:16,380 --> 01:55:17,180
Look at them!

1714
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,500
We can see Ariel.

1715
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,900
Flash, thank you so much for the donut.

1716
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:24,060
Thank you.

1717
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:28,960
We got even like the Yabloko Malocos.

1718
01:55:35,930 --> 01:55:37,550
Our fruit.

1719
01:55:40,210 --> 01:55:41,050
Blah blah blah.

1720
01:55:42,290 --> 01:55:44,370
Yabloko Malocos.

1721
01:55:46,730 --> 01:55:48,390
Our fruit.

1722
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:51,270
Our fruit.

1723
01:55:52,890 --> 01:55:54,070
This cutscene.

1724
01:55:55,590 --> 01:55:57,590
I get to see his silly little grin.

1725
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:01,090
Look at you!

1726
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:04,350
I'm holding up my baby snake to the screen.

1727
01:56:04,750 --> 01:56:05,490
It's you!

1728
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,750
It's you!

1729
01:56:07,490 --> 01:56:08,450
It's you!

1730
01:56:08,790 --> 01:56:10,290
Do you recognize yourself?

1731
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:11,910
Oh, R1.

1732
01:56:12,050 --> 01:56:12,430
Sorry about that.

1733
01:56:25,530 --> 01:56:26,650
It's you!

1734
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:29,730
No!

1735
01:56:30,650 --> 01:56:31,030
No!

1736
01:56:32,450 --> 01:56:35,110
Oh my gosh, it scared me for a second.

1737
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:38,510
It scared me!

1738
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:47,670
The loading times in this are pretty rough, I'm not going to lie.

1739
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:53,070
It looks like the codec is burned into my...

1740
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:56,650
into my computer screen.

1741
01:56:57,170 --> 01:56:58,310
Sometimes it's scary.

1742
01:57:04,020 --> 01:57:07,500
I can barely see these guys because of how...

1743
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:10,140
the quality.

1744
01:57:13,660 --> 01:57:14,900
There we go.

1745
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:16,780
Do you think I can get him?

1746
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,080
Maybe not from this far.

1747
01:57:24,200 --> 01:57:24,860
Hey mister!

1748
01:57:27,080 --> 01:57:28,000
There we go.

1749
01:57:28,900 --> 01:57:30,220
I can barely see you though.

1750
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,320
You're so grainy.

1751
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:37,680
Should we change our camouflage?

1752
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,000
Oh, I did it again.

1753
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:40,820
Nice shot.

1754
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:41,620
Thanks.

1755
01:57:43,720 --> 01:57:45,420
Yeah, let's change.

1756
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:51,440
Oh wow, we only have woodland paint.

1757
01:57:58,340 --> 01:57:59,460
Are there?

1758
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:00,680
There is another guy.

1759
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:02,020
They're not.

1760
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:03,480
Thank you!

1761
01:58:04,980 --> 01:58:07,240
I saw that baby snake was being sold for 5.

1762
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,680
I saw that!

1763
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:11,000
Oh my gosh, the 5,000 yen baby snake.

1764
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,280
Like, I saw that!

1765
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:14,200
It was in...

1766
01:58:14,200 --> 01:58:15,340
That was your picture?

1767
01:58:16,360 --> 01:58:16,880
Oh.

1768
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:19,720
Oh my gosh, he's scared.

1769
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:21,640
No you didn't.

1770
01:58:22,280 --> 01:58:22,700
My bad.

1771
01:58:23,320 --> 01:58:25,080
I did the wrong button.

1772
01:58:29,540 --> 01:58:30,580
I was like...

1773
01:58:30,580 --> 01:58:31,980
I was shocked.

1774
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:35,020
I was like, there's no way this costs this much.

1775
01:58:40,060 --> 01:58:43,520
Because I usually get them for like...

1776
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:45,800
Most like 1,000 yen.

1777
01:58:56,120 --> 01:58:58,880
Wait a second.

1778
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:00,780
Where's my...

1779
01:59:01,260 --> 01:59:02,660
Where's my...

1780
01:59:03,100 --> 01:59:05,660
You didn't...

1781
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,560
You didn't...

1782
01:59:12,490 --> 01:59:14,170
You didn't do the smile!

1783
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:17,490
No smirk!

1784
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:20,370
Are you gonna...

1785
01:59:26,210 --> 01:59:27,490
No cutscene.

1786
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:30,510
You think that guy is gone or...

1787
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:32,050
Can't tell.

1788
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:34,670
Let's just go.

1789
01:59:37,410 --> 01:59:39,170
If I get caught, I get caught.

1790
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:40,010
Oh shoot!

1791
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:41,530
No snake.

1792
01:59:41,910 --> 01:59:42,270
Go up.

1793
01:59:45,450 --> 01:59:46,610
Snake, please.

1794
01:59:46,950 --> 01:59:47,290
Go up.

1795
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:48,190
Go up.

1796
01:59:48,450 --> 01:59:48,890
Go up.

1797
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:50,070
Go up.

1798
01:59:53,410 --> 01:59:54,050
Easy.

1799
01:59:54,490 --> 01:59:54,850
Easy.

1800
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:55,970
Easy now.

1801
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:57,130
Easy now.

1802
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,520
I can never remember when there's a guy there or not.

1803
02:00:07,020 --> 02:00:07,560
You good?

1804
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:09,320
Controller drift?

1805
02:00:19,600 --> 02:00:20,620
We didn't...

1806
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:26,420
They probably were like, you're gonna have to get the full version for the special...

1807
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:28,100
For the special smile.

1808
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:29,660
In that part.

1809
02:00:30,920 --> 02:00:34,240
They really wanted you to know that the bees were there.

1810
02:00:34,400 --> 02:00:35,360
So they were like...

1811
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,400
By the way, there's bees.

1812
02:00:43,720 --> 02:00:46,520
His voice is like smooth butter.

1813
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:47,260
It's so good.

1814
02:00:48,680 --> 02:00:49,480
Yeah.

1815
02:00:58,650 --> 02:01:07,750
I want him to narrate everything for me.

1816
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:14,810
Interesting that the English localization was already done but not the recording.

1817
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:19,410
And it's like...

1818
02:01:20,390 --> 02:01:22,490
It's like the script and everything.

1819
02:01:24,550 --> 02:01:25,170
OK, bye bye.

1820
02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:26,850
It's like the script and everything too.

1821
02:01:28,610 --> 02:01:29,830
You think we'll get a meow?

1822
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:32,630
I don't think it will go to that, no?

1823
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:50,080
Just your imagination buddy.

1824
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:55,170
Yeah, just your imagination.

1825
02:01:58,050 --> 02:01:58,570
Kinose!

1826
02:01:58,930 --> 02:01:59,290
Kinose!

1827
02:02:00,710 --> 02:02:01,710
Don't worry about it.

1828
02:02:04,530 --> 02:02:06,730
I'll leave him alone.

1829
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:17,050
Oh, I did get him.

1830
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:21,490
I did get him.

1831
02:02:22,090 --> 02:02:22,910
How funny.

1832
02:02:24,210 --> 02:02:24,810
Oh.

1833
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:38,470
I think I would've just been the most excited ever to play this demo.

1834
02:02:41,370 --> 02:02:44,510
I recently got back from Ocean Deck.

1835
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:50,290
I hope you got to see the Wisps leading the Ota Gate and went at it for nearly 5 hours straight.

1836
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:51,670
Wait, what's Ocean Deck?

1837
02:02:55,590 --> 02:02:57,490
Let's go voice as Jigen in Modern Loop.

1838
02:02:58,510 --> 02:02:59,710
Stop, he does?

1839
02:03:00,790 --> 02:03:02,930
No, don't tell me that.

1840
02:03:03,310 --> 02:03:04,930
I love Jigen the most.

1841
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:09,970
I should've never been taught that information.

1842
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:15,500
I hear footsteps.

1843
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:18,420
They're like so faint in my ear.

1844
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:23,960
I think I can't tell if there's any guys because everything looks so crunchy.

1845
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,100
I can't tell where any of the men are.

1846
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:28,880
It's too crunchy.

1847
02:03:29,500 --> 02:03:31,220
I'm just standing here like a duck.

1848
02:03:32,100 --> 02:03:33,200
A standing duck.

1849
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:35,260
Not a sitting duck.

1850
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:41,340
Oh, there's a guy.

1851
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:48,020
Damn it, stupid controller sensitivity.

1852
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:52,900
The hand disappears so quickly.

1853
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:54,960
Oh, there's a guy right there.

1854
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:55,700
I see him, I see him.

1855
02:03:55,820 --> 02:03:56,460
I see him moving.

1856
02:03:56,460 --> 02:03:58,740
I was like, I know there's a guy in there.

1857
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:00,680
Please.

1858
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:03,680
I got him.

1859
02:04:09,950 --> 02:04:11,070
Don't notice me.

1860
02:04:13,090 --> 02:04:13,590
No one.

1861
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:21,880
Crispy.

1862
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:22,040
Yeah.

1863
02:04:23,800 --> 02:04:25,060
No, crispy.

1864
02:04:25,620 --> 02:04:26,320
Oh.

1865
02:04:32,240 --> 02:04:36,120
The guy's wearing pixel camo.

1866
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:41,640
MGS3!

1867
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:55,660
I heard him!

1868
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:56,960
I heard him!

1869
02:04:57,020 --> 02:04:58,140
I heard him!

1870
02:04:58,360 --> 02:05:00,000
I heard him!

1871
02:05:03,560 --> 02:05:07,480
Oh my gosh, Ocelot sounds so similar to English.

1872
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:13,680
Ocelot in Japanese sounds so similar to Ocelot in English.

1873
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:15,160
My heart.

1874
02:05:15,800 --> 02:05:18,500
I wasn't even...

1875
02:05:22,180 --> 02:05:24,060
Let's play cars!

1876
02:05:25,560 --> 02:05:28,560
Oh, I got to hear Ocelot.

1877
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:35,240
Let's play cars.

1878
02:05:36,040 --> 02:05:37,540
Brake, I don't need that.

1879
02:05:37,680 --> 02:05:40,620
Gas, reverse, steer...

1880
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,000
Boost, power slide!

1881
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:45,580
It's just like Mario Kart.

1882
02:05:46,620 --> 02:05:51,060
I lost gallons to you.

1883
02:05:51,620 --> 02:05:53,740
I hope you find it.

1884
02:05:54,260 --> 02:05:55,800
Of juice?

1885
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:00,800
I want juice.

1886
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,560
I want some apple juice.

1887
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:09,110
Remember to do the transformer noise.

1888
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:10,050
Transformer noise.

1889
02:06:18,890 --> 02:06:20,250
Orange juice.

1890
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:22,270
Hello?

1891
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:25,310
This is taking a long time to load.

1892
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:29,150
The cars game is hefty.

1893
02:06:29,150 --> 02:06:30,550
Thank you, thank you.

1894
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:31,010
Chu!

1895
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:31,710
Chu!

1896
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:39,210
Did you know if you got the demo disc with Mitara Daisuki?

1897
02:06:42,910 --> 02:06:45,050
What is this making a joke of?

1898
02:06:45,870 --> 02:06:47,030
I know that's Mitara.

1899
02:06:51,430 --> 02:06:53,830
Is a fujo-oshi a fujoshi?

1900
02:06:54,090 --> 02:06:55,590
Or am I just doing the language wrong?

1901
02:07:00,010 --> 02:07:02,130
Mitara Daisuki.

1902
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:03,210
Daisuki.

1903
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:06,250
I like

1904
02:07:11,650 --> 02:07:12,870
Daisuki.

1905
02:07:16,950 --> 02:07:19,350
How dare you.

1906
02:07:19,450 --> 02:07:21,470
How dare you make me tell lies.

1907
02:07:26,460 --> 02:07:27,990
Why is it still loading?

1908
02:07:28,770 --> 02:07:29,090
Hello?

1909
02:07:44,910 --> 02:07:47,050
Hold on, I'm checking my DMs real quick.

1910
02:07:50,150 --> 02:07:51,850
Why is this still loading?

1911
02:07:52,390 --> 02:07:53,630
We got the...

1912
02:07:54,310 --> 02:07:57,130
We even got the Pixar logo and everything.

1913
02:07:57,690 --> 02:07:59,390
It's a 4K game.

1914
02:08:02,030 --> 02:08:02,370
Hello?

1915
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:05,650
Oh, oh, oh, I'm playing the game now.

1916
02:08:07,150 --> 02:08:07,710
What?

1917
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:16,620
Strap it off the track.

1918
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:18,080
Leave me alone.

1919
02:08:19,460 --> 02:08:20,300
I can't see anything.

1920
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:21,420
It's so pixelated.

1921
02:08:22,860 --> 02:08:25,080
Power slide doesn't really work, I think.

1922
02:08:25,420 --> 02:08:26,660
Oh god, I'm drifting.

1923
02:08:27,240 --> 02:08:27,680
I'm drifting.

1924
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:30,420
Oh my god.

1925
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:34,000
He said it.

1926
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,420
He said the ka-chow.

1927
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:40,440
Oops.

1928
02:08:41,120 --> 02:08:41,860
You're okay.

1929
02:08:43,780 --> 02:08:44,780
I'm power sliding.

1930
02:08:44,780 --> 02:08:45,920
Wait, oh, through here?

1931
02:08:46,680 --> 02:08:46,840
Oops.

1932
02:08:48,580 --> 02:08:49,860
What is happening?

1933
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:53,940
I'm drifting, I'm drifting.

1934
02:08:54,540 --> 02:08:55,740
Everything's so crunchy.

1935
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,620
Safe driver, what does that mean?

1936
02:09:00,020 --> 02:09:01,300
Ka-chow.

1937
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:11,900
I wonder where everyone else is.

1938
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:15,760
I'm a safe driver, you guys.

1939
02:09:16,360 --> 02:09:18,280
Oh god, oh god.

1940
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:23,900
I'm a safe driver.

1941
02:09:25,780 --> 02:09:26,440
Oh, ouch.

1942
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,290
How am I supposed to...

1943
02:09:34,290 --> 02:09:36,110
Oh, they're right on my tail, I see them.

1944
02:09:41,610 --> 02:09:42,130
Ka-chow.

1945
02:09:43,170 --> 02:09:44,210
Can you guys hear it?

1946
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:45,110
Should I turn it up some?

1947
02:09:45,270 --> 02:09:47,170
It is so bright and so crunchy.

1948
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:49,570
I thought we would get a cutscene or something.

1949
02:09:51,110 --> 02:09:53,070
If this is the whole demo, I'm gonna cry.

1950
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:57,290
Ugh.

1951
02:09:59,110 --> 02:09:59,590
Ka-chow.

1952
02:10:09,560 --> 02:10:12,560
I'm gonna boost just to make sure that they're wait...

1953
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:14,780
I'm off track!

1954
02:10:15,060 --> 02:10:15,860
Oh no!

1955
02:10:19,050 --> 02:10:20,410
I'm still first, baby!

1956
02:10:32,170 --> 02:10:34,470
Oh, that's where my boost is from, okay.

1957
02:10:36,830 --> 02:10:37,410
Ka-chow.

1958
02:10:38,430 --> 02:10:40,170
That's all he says.

1959
02:10:41,050 --> 02:10:43,530
He goes, ooh, ow, and ka-chow.

1960
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:44,490
Dang,

1961
02:10:49,470 --> 02:10:50,230
I beat Doc.

1962
02:10:50,410 --> 02:10:51,790
I beat his best even.

1963
02:11:03,110 --> 02:11:04,090
Ka-chow.

1964
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:06,110
Next one.

1965
02:11:07,750 --> 02:11:08,210
No!

1966
02:11:10,430 --> 02:11:12,170
It took like...

1967
02:11:21,330 --> 02:11:21,490
I'm

1968
02:11:33,710 --> 02:11:35,370
disappointed right now.

1969
02:11:36,690 --> 02:11:36,990
What?

1970
02:11:37,170 --> 02:11:39,670
A Minto Ride to Hell Retribution Plate?

1971
02:11:39,810 --> 02:11:40,630
What is that?

1972
02:11:44,480 --> 02:11:46,500
I can't believe it!

1973
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:50,020
We got more of a Bug's Life than this.

1974
02:11:51,880 --> 02:11:54,580
Why are there so many racing games on this one?

1975
02:11:57,620 --> 02:11:58,960
What the heck?

1976
02:12:03,070 --> 02:12:06,370
The loading screen was totally meant to be like half the demo.

1977
02:12:09,110 --> 02:12:10,230
I might

1978
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:17,650
choose another one now, guys.

1979
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:19,190
I'm so disappointed.

1980
02:12:20,110 --> 02:12:21,730
The Guilty Gear one is just a video.

1981
02:12:23,150 --> 02:12:24,170
We can watch it.

1982
02:12:24,770 --> 02:12:26,230
We can watch Guilty Gear.

1983
02:12:31,810 --> 02:12:34,070
Here, I'll pick one while we're...

1984
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:44,000
You are!

1985
02:12:46,180 --> 02:12:48,240
Fine, it's just B&Gs.

1986
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,940
Two games in one.

1987
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:59,240
Does this count as another game completed for your yearly tag?

1988
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:04,790
This one!

1989
02:13:16,200 --> 02:13:18,080
I picked another disc.

1990
02:13:23,900 --> 02:13:24,500
Crunchy.

1991
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:27,500
I know, it's so small too.

1992
02:13:28,620 --> 02:13:30,720
Like, it doesn't even take up the whole screen.

1993
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:34,040
How can you even...

1994
02:13:34,740 --> 02:13:39,250
How can you even see?

1995
02:13:43,950 --> 02:13:44,690
Destroyed!

1996
02:13:55,850 --> 02:13:57,330
Okey-dokey.

1997
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:04,460
Put our next disc in.

1998
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:09,240
Might be the last disc.

1999
02:14:12,180 --> 02:14:13,720
That we do for today.

2000
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:16,160
I still have... How many more do we have?

2001
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:28,300
We still have...

2002
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:31,580
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

2003
02:14:31,580 --> 02:14:34,160
Oh, I didn't get to do Yakuza!

2004
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:37,000
Okey, I'll do Yakuza next time.

2005
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:38,880
Yakuza...

2006
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,600
Or should I wait until...

2007
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:43,800
We have...

2008
02:14:43,800 --> 02:14:46,220
This one also has a portable ops video.

2009
02:14:47,420 --> 02:14:50,520
Should we do Yakuza once I've played so I can compare.

2010
02:14:52,680 --> 02:14:56,400
Oh, I have two that have a Metal Gear portable ops video.

2011
02:15:08,950 --> 02:15:09,630
I'm an idiot.

2012
02:15:11,170 --> 02:15:11,470
I'm an idiot.

2013
02:15:11,470 --> 02:15:11,690
Oh no!

2014
02:15:12,550 --> 02:15:14,010
He just shot that guy down!

2015
02:15:16,890 --> 02:15:17,770
So quiet.

2016
02:15:19,790 --> 02:15:20,890
Where the hood at?

2017
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:23,270
Wait, am I gonna get...

2018
02:15:24,330 --> 02:15:25,590
I don't hear any music.

2019
02:15:29,550 --> 02:15:30,810
I'm gonna get a copy!

2020
02:15:30,970 --> 02:15:32,250
I'm gonna get a YouTube...

2021
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:38,860
DMCA!

2022
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:39,680
DMCA!

2023
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:40,280
DMCA!

2024
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:46,880
Break the law!

2025
02:15:53,900 --> 02:15:55,800
Break the frame rate!

2026
02:15:58,180 --> 02:16:00,320
It's urban insanity!

2027
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:06,920
Oh my god, the frame rate is insane.

2028
02:16:08,240 --> 02:16:09,700
16 players online?

2029
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:12,920
What?

2030
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,460
Oh my god, no wonder.

2031
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:17,400
Oh my god, that guy was flying in the air.

2032
02:16:21,120 --> 02:16:22,080
Where the hood at?

2033
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:22,980
Where the hood?

2034
02:16:23,040 --> 02:16:23,620
Where the hood?

2035
02:16:23,660 --> 02:16:24,520
Where the hood at?

2036
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:26,140
25 to life.

2037
02:16:33,310 --> 02:16:34,350
Spring 2005.

2038
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,850
Let's see.

2039
02:16:41,910 --> 02:16:43,210
Let's see, we got PSP.

2040
02:16:47,050 --> 02:16:48,950
Hot shots girls!

2041
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:52,010
And cute girls.

2042
02:16:53,290 --> 02:16:54,430
Showing off PSP.

2043
02:16:54,470 --> 02:16:54,970
Wait, what is it?

2044
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:57,450
Tell me all about the PSP.

2045
02:17:06,290 --> 02:17:07,690
Oh.

2046
02:17:11,470 --> 02:17:12,690
Wow.

2047
02:17:17,070 --> 02:17:20,490
They put him on the screen.

2048
02:17:24,650 --> 02:17:25,390
Wow.

2049
02:17:35,650 --> 02:17:37,490
They feel very comfortable.

2050
02:17:37,930 --> 02:17:43,250
Because it is very close to PlayStation controller.

2051
02:17:43,770 --> 02:17:44,730
Do you guys feel comfortable?

2052
02:17:45,450 --> 02:17:48,570
The steering wheel is a very important part of the car.

2053
02:17:49,070 --> 02:17:54,050
So we keep that kind of feeling when we design the PSP.

2054
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,370
Hot shot girls!

2055
02:18:10,530 --> 02:18:11,210
PSP.

2056
02:18:12,730 --> 02:18:13,410
PSP.

2057
02:18:13,870 --> 02:18:16,410
Everybody check your...if you have a PSP, check it.

2058
02:18:16,730 --> 02:18:19,090
Make sure the battery hasn't exploded.

2059
02:18:20,970 --> 02:18:22,930
Everybody check your PSP's today.

2060
02:18:23,370 --> 02:18:26,570
If you haven't already.

2061
02:18:35,650 --> 02:18:37,950
Now we are talking a huge chunk of memory at your disposal.

2062
02:18:38,270 --> 02:18:41,810
It's called UMD and it's the optical storage format for the PSP.

2063
02:18:43,410 --> 02:18:44,550
Oh, a place to plow.

2064
02:18:50,570 --> 02:18:52,970
Wow, she just...can I have that disc?

2065
02:18:53,430 --> 02:18:54,830
Did she just kiss that disc?

2066
02:18:54,830 --> 02:18:55,530
She just kissed it.

2067
02:19:00,750 --> 02:19:10,430
I got the PSP for the AKB48 dating sim.

2068
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:11,690
1 out of 48.

2069
02:19:14,690 --> 02:19:16,270
So I could date my Oshi.

2070
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:22,510
I dated her.

2071
02:19:25,930 --> 02:19:26,350
Yeah, I dated her.

2072
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:28,270
We were totally going steady.

2073
02:19:29,870 --> 02:19:31,750
Yeah, I dated her.

2074
02:19:32,730 --> 02:19:33,990
Yeah, no big deal.

2075
02:19:34,330 --> 02:19:35,870
Yeah, I dated an idol.

2076
02:19:36,390 --> 02:19:37,690
No big deal.

2077
02:19:38,620 --> 02:19:39,050
Yeah.

2078
02:19:40,750 --> 02:19:41,610
Yeah.

2079
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:49,690
I dated her and then I dated Nene and Love Plus at the same time.

2080
02:19:50,310 --> 02:19:53,910
I had two girlfriends at the same time.

2081
02:19:55,110 --> 02:19:56,090
No big deal.

2082
02:19:57,210 --> 02:19:57,770
Wifi!

2083
02:20:01,230 --> 02:20:02,350
Is that Tom Cruise?

2084
02:20:17,690 --> 02:20:18,770
Tom Cruise.

2085
02:20:28,830 --> 02:20:31,230
They just cloned that guy.

2086
02:20:31,970 --> 02:20:33,130
It's Snake and Liquid.

2087
02:20:35,210 --> 02:20:37,050
They're clones of each other.

2088
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:41,770
You can connect PS2 or PC through USB connections.

2089
02:20:42,070 --> 02:20:45,790
You can download some data from PS2.

2090
02:20:46,330 --> 02:20:52,430
So if you play a PS2 game, when you have to go out, you can check out the data through the PSP.

2091
02:20:52,830 --> 02:20:55,050
And then you can continue the game on the PSP.

2092
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:58,170
What was that thing transferring?

2093
02:20:58,690 --> 02:21:00,310
Now add in other options with peripherals.

2094
02:21:00,670 --> 02:21:03,550
The PSP is also a communicator and locator.

2095
02:21:03,730 --> 02:21:05,090
Make sure you check yours.

2096
02:21:05,770 --> 02:21:08,190
Peripherals such as the headset with a microphone.

2097
02:21:08,810 --> 02:21:12,270
So you can chat if the game supports the chat function.

2098
02:21:12,810 --> 02:21:12,890
Really?

2099
02:21:13,410 --> 02:21:14,110
That's crazy.

2100
02:21:14,150 --> 02:21:14,910
I didn't know it could do that.

2101
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:17,410
A toy type of game will be available.

2102
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:23,850
And also with the USB GPS, new mobile entertainment will be created.

2103
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:28,130
Oh my gosh, I have my Walkman right here.

2104
02:21:28,170 --> 02:21:29,490
On my desk actually.

2105
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:34,830
I got it out of my old car so that I could update it with new music.

2106
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:39,750
With such a versatile future facing product, Masajitani obviously excels at multitasking.

2107
02:21:40,230 --> 02:21:43,250
He has to juggle future concepts with practical methods of production.

2108
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:46,310
It's very exciting.

2109
02:21:46,610 --> 02:21:50,150
There are a lot of challenges we need to overcome.

2110
02:21:50,190 --> 02:21:50,650
Where was that?

2111
02:21:50,710 --> 02:21:51,790
Was that like TGS or something?

2112
02:21:51,810 --> 02:21:57,010
It is very exciting experiences to create something new with the new desktop.

2113
02:21:57,010 --> 02:21:57,510
You have a Walkman?

2114
02:21:57,690 --> 02:21:58,550
Yeah, I do.

2115
02:21:58,550 --> 02:22:02,350
It will also be exciting for those who pick up the PSP to live a surprising new lifestyle.

2116
02:22:03,570 --> 02:22:03,970
Akihabara!

2117
02:22:04,930 --> 02:22:06,270
That was Akihabara!

2118
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:09,910
Oh my gosh, I know that was right in front of the UNO Den building I think.

2119
02:22:11,410 --> 02:22:11,810
Maybe.

2120
02:22:12,170 --> 02:22:15,090
It actually depends on...maybe it wasn't.

2121
02:22:15,690 --> 02:22:15,990
I don't know.

2122
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:17,450
Depends on which side of the bridge you're on.

2123
02:22:22,310 --> 02:22:22,710
Akihabara...

2124
02:22:23,370 --> 02:22:23,770
Sorry!

2125
02:22:27,910 --> 02:22:30,050
I clapped when I saw it!

2126
02:22:30,810 --> 02:22:31,730
Oh, poops!

2127
02:22:32,190 --> 02:22:33,330
It was poops!

2128
02:22:34,190 --> 02:22:35,070
Oh, it was Acid.

2129
02:22:35,170 --> 02:22:35,530
Just kidding.

2130
02:22:35,970 --> 02:22:37,050
Yeah, because he had the...what's it called?

2131
02:22:39,650 --> 02:22:40,570
Not poops.

2132
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:42,710
It was Solid Snake.

2133
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:43,730
My bad.

2134
02:22:43,990 --> 02:22:44,790
I got excited.

2135
02:22:47,410 --> 02:22:49,010
I don't want to play Acid though.

2136
02:22:49,870 --> 02:22:50,730
Acid scares me.

2137
02:22:53,590 --> 02:22:54,550
What do we got on here?

2138
02:22:54,610 --> 02:22:55,930
We got Madagascar!

2139
02:22:56,450 --> 02:22:57,830
We got stolen.

2140
02:22:57,830 --> 02:22:58,850
Oh!

2141
02:22:59,570 --> 02:23:02,070
Wait, we literally watched the video for that earlier!

2142
02:23:03,070 --> 02:23:04,310
We got juiced.

2143
02:23:04,830 --> 02:23:06,950
We got Delta Force Black Hawk down.

2144
02:23:07,830 --> 02:23:11,210
We got Fight...Five Nights at Fight Night Round 2.

2145
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:13,410
We got Lego Star Wars!

2146
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:16,670
We got Star Wars Battlefront.

2147
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:20,810
Which I think I remember playing this demo as a kid.

2148
02:23:22,690 --> 02:23:25,190
MX versus ATB Unleashed.

2149
02:23:25,190 --> 02:23:28,450
Mobile Suit Gundam versus Zeta Gundam.

2150
02:23:29,070 --> 02:23:30,770
But this is just a video unfortunately.

2151
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:33,230
We got Destroy All Humans.

2152
02:23:34,010 --> 02:23:35,210
25 alive.

2153
02:23:35,550 --> 02:23:37,590
Dynasty Warriors 5!

2154
02:23:40,270 --> 02:23:41,910
PS2 Cordless Controller.

2155
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:46,270
Full Sail...

2156
02:23:46,270 --> 02:23:48,530
Real World Education.

2157
02:23:48,750 --> 02:23:49,210
What is this?

2158
02:23:49,970 --> 02:23:50,790
What is this?

2159
02:24:00,940 --> 02:24:02,280
It's a school.

2160
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:03,740
Let's find out.

2161
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:04,420
It's a video.

2162
02:24:04,540 --> 02:24:05,260
Let's find out.

2163
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:07,480
I want to do what I love for a living.

2164
02:24:07,720 --> 02:24:10,500
I want to make documentary films that can change the world.

2165
02:24:10,560 --> 02:24:14,400
I want my life to be about music and everything music.

2166
02:24:14,600 --> 02:24:16,080
Change the way people use the web.

2167
02:24:16,300 --> 02:24:17,980
Start with the biggest artist on the planet.

2168
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:21,900
Create robots and spaceships and aliens.

2169
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:23,980
Create the ultimate fighting game.

2170
02:24:24,980 --> 02:24:25,380
Animate.

2171
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:25,880
Direct.

2172
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:26,620
Mix, mix, mix.

2173
02:24:26,680 --> 02:24:27,020
Games.

2174
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:27,420
Movie.

2175
02:24:27,640 --> 02:24:28,040
Music.

2176
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:29,040
Who teaches that?

2177
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,240
Where can I learn that?

2178
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:31,400
Full Sail.

2179
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:32,660
Real World Education.

2180
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:33,280
Wow!

2181
02:24:33,500 --> 02:24:33,800
That was...

2182
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:34,520
That's where I want to be.

2183
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:36,580
That was a...

2184
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:39,840
That was a commercial.

2185
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:43,560
Wow!

2186
02:24:46,840 --> 02:24:48,300
What should we do?

2187
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:50,760
I want to play Madagascar.

2188
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:54,860
Jump, talk, special.

2189
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:56,760
There's two specials.

2190
02:24:58,560 --> 02:25:00,100
This is going to be great.

2191
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:01,820
Madagascar.

2192
02:25:06,020 --> 02:25:06,460
Wow!

2193
02:25:06,700 --> 02:25:12,420
PSA, if you attended Full Sail University and took out loans to do so, you may be entitled to discharge of those loans.

2194
02:25:12,480 --> 02:25:12,960
Wait, what?

2195
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:14,800
Did the school go under?

2196
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:17,100
Oh, start button.

2197
02:25:18,500 --> 02:25:19,660
Back to the beach.

2198
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,080
You guys, I'm getting...

2199
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:24,160
I'm getting...

2200
02:25:25,740 --> 02:25:26,620
I'm getting...

2201
02:25:27,420 --> 02:25:30,400
I'm getting Bugs Life vibes from this already.

2202
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,360
It was a scam!

2203
02:25:34,060 --> 02:25:35,300
It was for profit.

2204
02:25:42,780 --> 02:25:44,440
Put a sock in it.

2205
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:45,520
Where is the music?

2206
02:25:47,780 --> 02:25:49,380
There is no sound effects or anything.

2207
02:26:02,060 --> 02:26:02,960
Really?

2208
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:04,120
Wait, why does he sound so familiar?

2209
02:26:10,860 --> 02:26:13,860
Good news and bad news.

2210
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:23,320
They taped WWE NXT?

2211
02:26:23,640 --> 02:26:23,820
What?

2212
02:26:32,220 --> 02:26:32,700
What?

2213
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:37,520
Why does he sound so familiar?

2214
02:26:41,160 --> 02:26:43,560
How about we get this beacon together first?

2215
02:26:45,260 --> 02:26:46,980
He's not Frogbird.

2216
02:26:47,100 --> 02:26:48,420
It doesn't sound like Frogbird.

2217
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:50,720
Switch players.

2218
02:26:52,500 --> 02:26:53,560
Oh, we can...

2219
02:26:53,560 --> 02:26:54,620
Why can't I be the lion?

2220
02:26:54,740 --> 02:26:55,440
What's wrong with him?

2221
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:57,960
What does this guy look like?

2222
02:26:57,960 --> 02:26:59,620
Go get him, tiger.

2223
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:00,600
Oh, he's so tall.

2224
02:27:04,940 --> 02:27:05,460
Okay.

2225
02:27:06,120 --> 02:27:07,840
He just growled at her.

2226
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:11,080
I don't recall a warthog in Madagascar.

2227
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:14,060
I have a confession.

2228
02:27:14,200 --> 02:27:16,100
I've never watched Madagascar before.

2229
02:27:19,680 --> 02:27:20,880
That's my confession.

2230
02:27:21,500 --> 02:27:22,100
What's this?

2231
02:27:22,380 --> 02:27:22,900
Giraffe.

2232
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:23,940
Oh my god!

2233
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:24,960
They dug his grave!

2234
02:27:31,480 --> 02:27:33,120
Guys, that was his special?

2235
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:35,760
Okay, he has two specials.

2236
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:37,180
He can do this.

2237
02:27:38,480 --> 02:27:41,460
Or he can do this.

2238
02:28:23,310 --> 02:28:24,430
Oh god!

2239
02:28:25,230 --> 02:28:26,370
He also does that.

2240
02:28:32,180 --> 02:28:32,800
Sorry!

2241
02:28:35,980 --> 02:28:36,600
Sorry!

2242
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:43,200
Do these count as the parts?

2243
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:44,620
Or am I getting...

2244
02:28:49,240 --> 02:28:51,560
My stomach hurts so bad!

2245
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:54,940
Oh god!

2246
02:28:55,260 --> 02:28:55,820
Oh shit!

2247
02:28:57,340 --> 02:28:57,960
What

2248
02:29:17,670 --> 02:29:19,250
are the peppers for?

2249
02:29:19,310 --> 02:29:20,250
Why can't I eat them?

2250
02:29:23,330 --> 02:29:25,050
Oh holy moly.

2251
02:29:25,250 --> 02:29:26,230
Can I go after this guy?

2252
02:29:26,750 --> 02:29:27,510
Oh god!

2253
02:29:51,630 --> 02:29:54,090
I'm in literal tears, you guys.

2254
02:29:54,270 --> 02:29:59,250
I can't!

2255
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:10,150
Holy cow!

2256
02:30:10,910 --> 02:30:12,430
I can't...I'm crying.

2257
02:30:12,790 --> 02:30:13,810
What do you want?

2258
02:30:15,210 --> 02:30:16,150
Oh my god!

2259
02:30:16,630 --> 02:30:17,470
He's so small!

2260
02:30:54,150 --> 02:30:55,590
I can't...

2261
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:56,610
Oh my god!

2262
02:30:58,070 --> 02:31:00,010
Wait, what did I do wrong?

2263
02:31:00,730 --> 02:31:02,150
What did I do wrong?

2264
02:31:04,370 --> 02:31:05,250
Charge!

2265
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:07,930
Wait, what am I doing wrong?

2266
02:31:09,730 --> 02:31:11,050
Maybe this button.

2267
02:31:13,610 --> 02:31:14,490
Use...

2268
02:31:14,490 --> 02:31:18,190
Okay, okay.

2269
02:31:18,290 --> 02:31:19,010
We gotta aim.

2270
02:31:20,610 --> 02:31:20,610
Okay.

2271
02:31:24,030 --> 02:31:25,470
Okay, too far.

2272
02:31:28,610 --> 02:31:30,070
Too soft.

2273
02:31:34,950 --> 02:31:37,650
Wait, these guys are dead!

2274
02:31:39,350 --> 02:31:43,930
I can see their little ear pockets!

2275
02:31:44,170 --> 02:31:52,110
I can't

2276
02:32:26,980 --> 02:32:27,740
stop crying.

2277
02:32:38,840 --> 02:32:40,160
I can't look at him.

2278
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:41,000
He's dead.

2279
02:32:41,200 --> 02:32:42,560
What do I do?

2280
02:32:44,100 --> 02:32:45,080
Oops, wait.

2281
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:46,560
Oh no, I killed it.

2282
02:33:06,610 --> 02:33:08,950
I can't stop laughing.

2283
02:33:08,950 --> 02:33:09,030
I can't stop laughing.

2284
02:33:10,210 --> 02:33:11,690
Oh my god!

2285
02:33:12,350 --> 02:33:14,090
Oh shit, I did it again!

2286
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:27,030
No, I just barely made it.

2287
02:33:32,470 --> 02:33:33,750
Oh no!

2288
02:33:43,690 --> 02:33:48,190
Wait, it's so hard to get in the middle.

2289
02:33:49,630 --> 02:33:51,190
Oh god, they are really dying!

2290
02:33:56,750 --> 02:33:57,930
I can't.

2291
02:33:57,950 --> 02:33:59,430
I can't play anymore!

2292
02:34:02,810 --> 02:34:05,190
He looked like he died though.

2293
02:34:05,310 --> 02:34:08,550
That second guy did not look like he made it.

2294
02:34:13,590 --> 02:34:14,570
Oh no!

2295
02:34:20,390 --> 02:34:21,710
Oh yeah!

2296
02:34:22,250 --> 02:34:23,050
He did make it.

2297
02:34:23,110 --> 02:34:23,970
First try!

2298
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:36,990
Wait, are all their little lemur bodies littered in the ground?

2299
02:34:37,550 --> 02:34:38,730
Okay, no, they are gone.

2300
02:34:39,470 --> 02:34:43,790
Did we hold a proper burial for them?

2301
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:49,570
Oh gosh, you guys.

2302
02:34:52,150 --> 02:34:53,170
I'm okay.

2303
02:34:53,350 --> 02:34:53,870
I'm cool.

2304
02:34:54,030 --> 02:34:54,710
I'm calm.

2305
02:34:55,450 --> 02:34:56,470
And I'm collected.

2306
02:35:01,550 --> 02:35:02,430
What is this?

2307
02:35:03,230 --> 02:35:04,430
Oh, you got a thing.

2308
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:12,630
Press spin to pay respects.

2309
02:35:13,070 --> 02:35:14,450
It says here giraffe.

2310
02:35:16,990 --> 02:35:18,530
Like what do you want me to do?

2311
02:35:21,690 --> 02:35:24,550
Is this how speedrunners...

2312
02:35:27,810 --> 02:35:30,010
Is this how people speedrun the game?

2313
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:40,750
It shouldn't be this funny.

2314
02:35:41,310 --> 02:35:42,850
It really...

2315
02:35:43,550 --> 02:35:45,270
It shouldn't be this funny.

2316
02:35:46,950 --> 02:35:47,750
Leave.

2317
02:35:48,290 --> 02:35:48,870
Cow.

2318
02:35:50,250 --> 02:35:51,310
Oh god.

2319
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:55,210
Spin to win.

2320
02:35:55,690 --> 02:35:56,470
Can we get on this?

2321
02:35:58,250 --> 02:35:59,050
Nice!

2322
02:36:01,790 --> 02:36:06,710
Only a trained professional should attempt this kind of risky stunts.

2323
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:14,770
I got it!

2324
02:36:19,490 --> 02:36:20,710
What did I just hear?

2325
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:26,280
Oh no!

2326
02:36:26,360 --> 02:36:26,920
I got you!

2327
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:28,380
I got you!

2328
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:29,720
I'm coming!

2329
02:36:29,840 --> 02:36:30,360
Wait, hold on.

2330
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:31,280
I got to turn around.

2331
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:33,420
I'm coming!

2332
02:36:36,720 --> 02:36:44,820
I think I can only talk to him.

2333
02:36:45,260 --> 02:36:46,080
Speedrun's trapped.

2334
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:57,420
Is the crab involved in the job?

2335
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:00,340
Do you need...OK.

2336
02:37:00,860 --> 02:37:02,320
Where is the switch?

2337
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:06,680
We got to see what everybody else's specials are.

2338
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:08,660
Where is it?

2339
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:21,340
Where is the...that can change characters.

2340
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:23,500
Where is the little totem thing?

2341
02:37:25,260 --> 02:37:26,180
Oh there is one.

2342
02:37:31,860 --> 02:37:33,280
Oh gosh.

2343
02:37:34,980 --> 02:37:37,900
Oh she also spins but like...

2344
02:37:38,660 --> 02:37:39,500
Here I go!

2345
02:37:43,100 --> 02:37:44,280
Oh damn!

2346
02:37:48,760 --> 02:37:50,360
She also...

2347
02:37:53,440 --> 02:37:55,460
Get me out of here.

2348
02:37:55,820 --> 02:37:56,300
I'm scared.

2349
02:37:58,300 --> 02:38:01,460
Oh there is like signs that point to which character does what.

2350
02:38:05,360 --> 02:38:07,320
She is too big to jump.

2351
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:10,560
She is so fast.

2352
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:12,360
We already got 4 out of 10 you guys.

2353
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:13,060
We are killing it.

2354
02:38:13,380 --> 02:38:13,980
Can I go in here?

2355
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:18,640
We are in the crock pit?

2356
02:38:19,540 --> 02:38:20,840
That doesn't seem very good.

2357
02:38:22,800 --> 02:38:26,180
I'm going to leave before anything bad happens.

2358
02:38:27,280 --> 02:38:29,200
We need to go talk to our little friend.

2359
02:38:55,250 --> 02:39:00,510
Well if you can squash enough of them in time, there is a piece of the rescue beacon in it for you.

2360
02:39:00,630 --> 02:39:03,850
As well as some quality face time with yours truly.

2361
02:39:05,230 --> 02:39:06,250
Oh my god!

2362
02:39:10,010 --> 02:39:13,090
Wait, how do I...how do I...oh shoot.

2363
02:39:15,010 --> 02:39:17,730
How do I...oh here it is.

2364
02:39:20,810 --> 02:39:23,310
How do I smash the crabs?

2365
02:39:23,310 --> 02:39:25,150
How do I do that?

2366
02:39:35,980 --> 02:39:37,380
I'm...ok.

2367
02:39:58,260 --> 02:40:01,060
Oh shoot.

2368
02:40:01,860 --> 02:40:04,080
What is the sound effect?

2369
02:40:04,880 --> 02:40:06,060
Holy cow!

2370
02:40:06,760 --> 02:40:08,340
What is the sound effect?

2371
02:40:42,510 --> 02:40:46,770
He spent half of that time just laughing at Deadly Rage.

2372
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:53,930
Guys, I don't think I have any...can we watch the Gundam video?

2373
02:40:54,110 --> 02:40:54,710
Yes we can.

2374
02:40:54,850 --> 02:40:58,570
I have no strength in me to do anything else.

2375
02:40:59,330 --> 02:41:00,930
I laughed myself silly.

2376
02:41:07,270 --> 02:41:10,050
I'm sorry I laughed so much at that.

2377
02:41:10,150 --> 02:41:10,830
I'm sorry.

2378
02:41:13,530 --> 02:41:15,670
I'm still crying.

2379
02:41:22,920 --> 02:41:25,720
I knew Madagascar wouldn't let us down.

2380
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:30,080
I love the Disney games.

2381
02:41:30,260 --> 02:41:30,740
They're the best.

2382
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:34,000
Oh wait, that's not Disney.

2383
02:41:34,140 --> 02:41:34,900
That's Dreamworks.

2384
02:41:34,900 --> 02:41:37,460
I love the shovelware games.

2385
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:38,200
They're the best.

2386
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:50,080
The sounds are so awesome.

2387
02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:51,740
Oh, that's it.

2388
02:41:52,940 --> 02:41:54,240
That's all you get.

2389
02:41:58,080 --> 02:41:59,440
Holy cow.

2390
02:42:00,300 --> 02:42:02,160
Too much time killing lemurs.

2391
02:42:05,100 --> 02:42:05,980
I was...

2392
02:42:05,980 --> 02:42:06,140
I was...

2393
02:42:06,140 --> 02:42:08,640
I literally LMFAO'd you everybody.

2394
02:42:09,540 --> 02:42:10,800
It was so funny.

2395
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:13,720
That was so, so funny.

2396
02:42:27,370 --> 02:42:27,810
Anyway.

2397
02:42:28,090 --> 02:42:30,510
Sorry, I'm looking at some messages from people.

2398
02:42:31,110 --> 02:42:32,010
This was so funny.

2399
02:42:32,210 --> 02:42:34,430
I hope you guys enjoyed...

2400
02:42:35,330 --> 02:42:37,930
more of the PlayStation demos.

2401
02:42:38,790 --> 02:42:40,290
I don't know when I'll do the next one.

2402
02:42:40,350 --> 02:42:41,410
I'll give it some time.

2403
02:42:41,530 --> 02:42:42,570
Maybe collect some more.

2404
02:42:42,710 --> 02:42:43,010
Who knows?

2405
02:42:44,950 --> 02:42:45,470
But...

2406
02:42:47,850 --> 02:42:49,590
That was so good.

2407
02:42:49,970 --> 02:42:52,170
I want to play the Madagascar one again.

2408
02:42:57,060 --> 02:42:59,360
Warthog was voiced by Steven Stanton.

2409
02:42:59,440 --> 02:43:00,000
What has he done?

2410
02:43:00,220 --> 02:43:00,400
Let's see.

2411
02:43:01,920 --> 02:43:02,960
Steven Stanton.

2412
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:05,520
I've

2413
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:12,070
heard his voice before in something.

2414
02:43:13,470 --> 02:43:14,350
Maybe not.

2415
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:24,260
I hope you guys laughed as much as I did.

2416
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,920
I hope it wasn't just me.

2417
02:43:30,940 --> 02:43:32,580
Thank you, TriPrincess.

2418
02:43:34,440 --> 02:43:35,580
Thank you for the stream.

2419
02:43:35,700 --> 02:43:36,080
Thank you.

2420
02:43:36,440 --> 02:43:37,220
Thank you guys.

2421
02:43:37,460 --> 02:43:37,680
Thank you.

2422
02:43:38,200 --> 02:43:39,420
This is so fun.

2423
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:44,340
Oh yeah, there.

2424
02:43:44,560 --> 02:43:45,220
Video games.

2425
02:43:46,320 --> 02:43:49,040
Madagascar is Melman and Wilbur.

2426
02:43:51,660 --> 02:43:52,700
Does my man do games?

2427
02:43:52,700 --> 02:43:55,220
He hasn't done a game since 2022.

2428
02:43:56,460 --> 02:43:56,900
No!

2429
02:43:58,520 --> 02:44:00,500
Demo disc streams are always so good.

2430
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:02,480
What a banger to end on, huh?

2431
02:44:02,860 --> 02:44:03,300
Codefushi!

2432
02:44:03,540 --> 02:44:04,580
Thank you so much for the 50k.

2433
02:44:04,600 --> 02:44:05,400
Thank you.

2434
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:07,020
Hard to breathe.

2435
02:44:12,660 --> 02:44:16,180
Dude of YouTubers.

2436
02:44:17,400 --> 02:44:18,540
Thanks for watching.

2437
02:44:18,920 --> 02:44:20,080
Thanks for hanging out.

2438
02:44:20,800 --> 02:44:23,080
This stream is the best thing that happened to me the whole day.

2439
02:44:28,450 --> 02:44:32,010
I was just seeing the levers dead on the ground.

2440
02:44:46,540 --> 02:44:47,940
Are these demo discs on emulator?

2441
02:44:48,060 --> 02:44:48,340
No!

2442
02:44:48,940 --> 02:44:50,880
They're on official PS2.

2443
02:44:51,060 --> 02:44:51,620
Official hardware.

2444
02:44:54,980 --> 02:44:55,640
Yes, yes.

2445
02:44:57,180 --> 02:45:00,820
But yeah, we have still more demo discs so we'll do this again in the future.

2446
02:45:01,440 --> 02:45:03,620
And I hope you guys have a great day.

2447
02:45:03,740 --> 02:45:04,680
Have a good night.

2448
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:07,380
And I will see you when I see you next.

2449
02:45:07,380 --> 02:45:09,220
I gotta get to bed soon.

2450
02:45:09,640 --> 02:45:11,940
Cause I gotta wake up early for a collab.

2451
02:45:13,960 --> 02:45:15,700
That... maybe I'll stream my POV.

2452
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:16,380
I don't know yet.

2453
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:20,100
I'm gonna make a thumbnail and I'll decide in the morning how tired I am.

2454
02:45:21,180 --> 02:45:22,000
Thanks for the fun stream.

2455
02:45:22,040 --> 02:45:22,840
Hope you feel better soon.

2456
02:45:22,940 --> 02:45:23,560
Thank you, Bakeme!

2457
02:45:24,320 --> 02:45:27,380
So the waiting room, if I do decide to stream my POV for that...

2458
02:45:28,260 --> 02:45:32,380
It's a... I've also never played the game before, Lockdown Protocol, so...

2459
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:34,980
I'm kind of nervous about everything.

2460
02:45:37,600 --> 02:45:38,160
But...

2461
02:45:38,780 --> 02:45:39,340
Hestia.

2462
02:45:39,540 --> 02:45:40,820
Hestia from Bishoujo.

2463
02:45:41,240 --> 02:45:42,740
JP, she invited me.

2464
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:48,840
And it's a collab.

2465
02:45:49,080 --> 02:45:51,160
It's at 8AM, my time.

2466
02:45:51,300 --> 02:45:52,160
So it's early.

2467
02:45:54,480 --> 02:45:55,600
We'll see.

2468
02:46:02,890 --> 02:46:04,530
It's early time.

2469
02:46:09,390 --> 02:46:11,350
Have fun with K-san and Henyao.

2470
02:46:12,030 --> 02:46:14,710
Nah, I've never talked to K-san before so I'm nervous.

2471
02:46:22,870 --> 02:46:23,610
Yeah.

2472
02:46:23,830 --> 02:46:24,190
Spank!

2473
02:46:24,290 --> 02:46:24,930
Thanks for the 10 gift!

2474
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:33,090
Basically, Hestia invited people that she knew could speak Japanese and English.

2475
02:46:33,390 --> 02:46:36,450
So it's like a JP-EN collab.

2476
02:46:36,790 --> 02:46:37,570
It's kind of interesting.

2477
02:46:38,290 --> 02:46:40,110
I don't know what we'll be speaking most.

2478
02:46:40,790 --> 02:46:43,170
Whether it's Japanese or English.

2479
02:46:45,550 --> 02:46:46,290
So...

2480
02:46:46,290 --> 02:46:47,570
That's kind of...

2481
02:46:47,570 --> 02:46:50,570
That's kind of why I got invited.

2482
02:46:54,190 --> 02:46:55,070
Hot dog!

2483
02:46:56,850 --> 02:46:57,690
Not just you, Minto.

2484
02:46:57,810 --> 02:46:58,950
I was really cracking up.

2485
02:47:00,170 --> 02:47:01,550
Really looking forward to cracking up.

2486
02:47:01,670 --> 02:47:02,550
Oh yeah, and I cracked up.

2487
02:47:03,010 --> 02:47:05,170
I have not laughed that hard in so long.

2488
02:47:05,310 --> 02:47:07,110
Thank you, MadagascarGiraffe.

2489
02:47:09,510 --> 02:47:10,390
Kuso Nihongo.

2490
02:47:10,730 --> 02:47:11,350
Yeah, maybe.

2491
02:47:13,050 --> 02:47:15,590
That's another reason why I was nervous to stream it too.

2492
02:47:17,870 --> 02:47:19,990
Thank you so much for the fun stream, Minto.

2493
02:47:20,070 --> 02:47:20,570
I love you.

2494
02:47:20,570 --> 02:47:21,470
Thank you!

2495
02:47:21,690 --> 02:47:23,570
Thanks for the superchat, Cyberfishy!

2496
02:47:25,110 --> 02:47:27,030
Speedyfire, thank you so much for the 5 gift ticket!

2497
02:47:27,190 --> 02:47:27,830
Thank you!

2498
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:33,150
Gonna learn Japanese for the stream.

2499
02:47:37,070 --> 02:47:39,170
I don't know, I'm so nervous about it.

2500
02:47:39,210 --> 02:47:39,990
And it's early morning.

2501
02:47:40,190 --> 02:47:46,590
So if I do decide to stream at POV, the waiting room might even be up like 30 minutes before the stream.

2502
02:47:48,010 --> 02:47:50,470
Sorry for any... sorry if it's last minute.

2503
02:47:56,030 --> 02:47:57,470
Happy early birthday!

2504
02:47:58,530 --> 02:48:00,150
Otaminto, thanks for the nostalgia trip.

2505
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:00,790
Thank you!

2506
02:48:01,770 --> 02:48:02,250
Otaminto!

2507
02:48:03,890 --> 02:48:05,170
Thank you, Swampclose.

2508
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:06,730
Loved this game as a kid.

2509
02:48:06,830 --> 02:48:08,290
For a movie tie, it was very fun.

2510
02:48:08,890 --> 02:48:11,070
It reminds me so much of the...

2511
02:48:14,910 --> 02:48:17,090
The Emperor's New Groove game that I played.

2512
02:48:20,550 --> 02:48:25,110
I love Lockdown Protocol because as a traitor, you can just win by lying and hiding items.

2513
02:48:25,290 --> 02:48:26,290
I've never played it.

2514
02:48:26,570 --> 02:48:27,930
I don't know anything about it.

2515
02:48:28,450 --> 02:48:29,510
I know nothing.

2516
02:48:37,960 --> 02:48:41,160
I don't know if my Nihongo will work so early in the morning.

2517
02:48:42,340 --> 02:48:43,880
Go play Ace Combat and Monster Hunter.

2518
02:48:44,280 --> 02:48:45,000
Have fun!

2519
02:48:45,900 --> 02:48:48,000
Are you planning on reacting to the Nintendo Direct?

2520
02:48:48,100 --> 02:48:49,840
I don't think I will be able to.

2521
02:48:49,920 --> 02:48:51,600
I think it will overlap with the collab.

2522
02:48:51,600 --> 02:48:54,080
Unless the collab is like 2 hours.

2523
02:48:55,780 --> 02:48:57,600
Wait, what time is the Nintendo Direct?

2524
02:48:59,340 --> 02:49:01,020
I think it's 10 AM my time.

2525
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:08,930
All that spinning is giving me Gedan bias.

2526
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:11,470
10 AM EST.

2527
02:49:12,390 --> 02:49:16,510
If the collab is 2 hours, I will make a...

2528
02:49:16,510 --> 02:49:20,070
I will make a waiting... like a thumbnail just in case.

2529
02:49:21,050 --> 02:49:23,310
Maybe if the collab goes over...

2530
02:49:24,550 --> 02:49:26,770
Then obviously I can't.

2531
02:49:26,810 --> 02:49:31,910
But if it ends early-ish, then I will do a Direct.

2532
02:49:32,750 --> 02:49:35,030
And I'll have a waiting room just in case.

2533
02:49:35,190 --> 02:49:36,530
Or not a waiting room, a thumbnail.

2534
02:49:36,730 --> 02:49:38,450
So I can make a last minute waiting room.

2535
02:49:41,850 --> 02:49:42,710
But we'll see.

2536
02:49:43,330 --> 02:49:47,570
If we're having fun and having a good time, I'm not gonna, you know...

2537
02:49:47,570 --> 02:49:48,310
I'm not gonna...

2538
02:49:57,360 --> 02:49:58,640
I won't be able to sleep.

2539
02:49:58,700 --> 02:49:59,960
I'll be awake at that point.

2540
02:50:03,160 --> 02:50:04,100
We'll see though.

2541
02:50:05,180 --> 02:50:05,740
We'll see.

2542
02:50:12,120 --> 02:50:12,560
Yeah!

2543
02:50:12,820 --> 02:50:13,000
OK!

2544
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:14,560
Thank you guys!

2545
02:50:15,140 --> 02:50:15,580
Otsumamito!

2546
02:50:15,940 --> 02:50:18,780
And I hope you guys have a good day, have a good night!

2547
02:50:18,920 --> 02:50:19,680
Thank you so much for watching!

2548
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:20,840
Thanks for hanging out with me!

2549
02:50:21,700 --> 02:50:22,140
Otsumamito!

2550
02:50:22,240 --> 02:50:22,620
Otsumamito!

2551
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:23,720
Itterasshai!

2552
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:25,780
Bye bye!

2553
02:50:26,180 --> 02:50:27,700
Your laughs give me so much energy.

2554
02:50:29,060 --> 02:50:30,260
Thanks Shabir!

2555
02:50:30,340 --> 02:50:31,140
Thank you!

2556
02:50:31,580 --> 02:50:32,380
Bye bye!
