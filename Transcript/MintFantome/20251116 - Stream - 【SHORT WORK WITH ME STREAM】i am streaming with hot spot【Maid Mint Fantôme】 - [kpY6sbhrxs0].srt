1
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,590
Um, um, hello.

2
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,570
Um, hi.

3
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,190
Um, hello.

4
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,750
Wait, hold on, I'm moving.

5
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:19,410
I'm grabbing my mic and said, Oh, go ahead, Jinjama, itchama, hello.

6
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,990
Look, though.

7
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:52,550
P&D but I have video in the background so that you will still watch so that you will still you'll still be paying attention yeah hello everybody um I'm in a hotel room so there were many things that went wrong with this stream the first being that I'm in the hotel room.

8
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,850
And the second being that.

9
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,450
Oh my gosh.

10
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,450
What's it called?

11
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,750
The noise gate on this thing is crazy.

12
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,290
How does it sound?

13
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,450
Oh, okay.

14
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:02,770
Nevermind.

15
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,810
The GoXLR program does not work.

16
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,470
So I actually can't update anything.

17
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,130
So we're just gonna, I sound loud.

18
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:21,110
We're just gonna need, we're just gonna, we're just gonna, uh, we're just gonna do it.

19
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:21,690
I sound okay.

20
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,870
Yeah, that sounds fine.

21
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,250
Um.

22
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,870
What was I saying?

23
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,770
Oh, so I'm in the hotel room.

24
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,070
And, um, well, I was like, I'm going to test.

25
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,010
Okay, hold on.

26
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,390
Let me explain hotel struggles first.

27
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:44,670
Um, I was like, okay, I'm going to sign in to get free Wi-Fi.

28
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,730
And then they were like, oh, sorry, you can't log in right now.

29
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,730
We're working on it.

30
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,310
And I said, okay, cool, then I'll hotspot.

31
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,050
So I'm hotspotting and it might be bad.

32
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,870
Hopefully not bad, though.

33
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:10,430
And then, and then, um, and then there's one plug by the desk.

34
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:20,430
And I need a plug for my laptop and also for this USB hub that I bring with me.

35
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,430
So I need two plugs.

36
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:33,830
And because I cannot plug in both, I cannot also plug in my camera for me to move.

37
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,510
And so, I need two plugs.

38
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,590
And so, because of that, hotel Wi-Fi is always a gamba.

39
00:04:51,310 --> 00:05:18,010
well it shouldn't be can't you plug your camera directly into your computer great question I cannot do that because I only have two USB slots and that's why I need the USB hub because I need to plug in my go XLR and I need to plug in my mouse and I need to plug in my phone USB USB USB

40
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,910
Osp.

41
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,230
Yeah, I'm Metal Gear thinking about guns.

42
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,230
So...

43
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:33,930
So...

44
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,450
Can you put Family Guy clips in the corner?

45
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:37,370
No!

46
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,450
They're gonna take me out.

47
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,710
This is Family Guy!

48
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,650
Hold on.

49
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,710
How's the song go?

50
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,710
It seems today that all you see is violence and movies and sex online.

51
00:05:50,730 --> 00:06:18,630
TV wait hold on commercial 1121 star but where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely lucky there's a family guy lucky there's a man who can do all the things that make us laugh and cry he's a family guy

52
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,820
I'm like laying on the couch.

53
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,400
Not laying on the couch.

54
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,980
I'm sitting, but I threw my head back because I was laughing and I hit my head.

55
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,640
Good morning, USA.

56
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,620
I have a feeling that it's going to be a wonderful day.

57
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
That's the Superior Show.

58
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,000
I like American Dad way more than I like.

59
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,080
family guy, I think.

60
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,700
That's the superior show.

61
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,040
The sun in the sky has a smile on its face.

62
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,160
And a salute to the American race.

63
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,880
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

64
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,980
Oh, boy, I'm so young to say, Good morning, you are saying.

65
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,040
Boys, Oh yeah, shot B12.

66
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,380
Yeah.

67
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,380
I haven't watched American Down in so long, though.

68
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,260
Nailed it.

69
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:34,820
I know.

70
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
But, um...

71
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,080
Uh...

72
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,180
Yeah, so then, that's why I'm a PNG, I apologize.

73
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,420
Um, but I have some work that I need to get done.

74
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,580
That's why I brought my laptop in the first place and my whole setup.

75
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,520
But as you can see, it's a little scuffed.

76
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300
like oh so also i had bought a smaller version of my inter interface that i use at the maid cafe to be my travel interface this is previously and then i used it at an event and it completely like shat itself it was it was uh like i guess it's made more for i don't i thought i was using it correctly but I guess it's made more for um like musical like playing playing like if you're recording guitar and stuff and uh I figured I was like you know if I ever do a collab like on its own it was totally fine if I was doing a collab or something it would like double the audio and things like that so I was like okay well I'll get I'll get rid of it and then um I bought the Which I have not had a GoXLR in an extremely long time.

77
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,440
Yeah, it was really awful.

78
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,380
I used it at MGSCon.

79
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,300
And it was, you know, I thought I had the correct settings.

80
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,480
But there literally was no other settings that I could try.

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So I was like, oh, I felt so terrible.

82
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,860
Because, you know, I was like, I thought it was the same.

83
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:52,060
same as my interface at home but it just didn't have enough channels of how i do my setup um didn't go xlr die i yes but also they were like bought out question mark or something what do i usually use i use i normally use a yamaha ag08 and then they have the yamaha ag03 which is what i had bought and i was like this is perfect it's exactly my setup i know i like it I know I like,

84
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:59,180
I know how to use it, except it just doesn't work for my kind of streaming.

85
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,400
Like I said, it would be fine on its own.

86
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,860
It would just, you know, I don't want to get something.

87
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:14,600
And then if I'm traveling, you know, last time I traveled, I had a collab with like Kiara and Kobo and Ali.

88
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,900
So I was like, wait, wait, it was, wait.

89
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,760
Am I going crazy?

90
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,500
Olly was in that collab, right?

91
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,100
Or am I insane right now?

92
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,140
No?

93
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,160
Wait, who?

94
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,360
There was one other...

95
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,080
Wait, yes!

96
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,400
Yeah, okay, I was like...

97
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,000
Okay.

98
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,080
Because I remember, because I saw...

99
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,300
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

100
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,000
I...

101
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,920
Okay, I remember why I was confused.

102
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,980
It's because I was thinking of Olly's default outfit.

103
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,600
But in the thumbnail, I used...

104
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:57,660
her like otaku outfit that's why i was like wait a second so um yeah so

105
00:11:01,460 --> 00:12:15,180
and so um like you know i wouldn't have been able to do that collab if i had the other interface you know things like that i was like i don't want to say no to stuff just because of my interface so so i got the go xlr mini instead but right now right now it's giving me this error dcp error please update your firmware to the most recent version which i did it says if firmware is up to date try repairing the driver with our driver repair wizard and i just really don't feel like doing that and it won't let me into the software to edit anything like my voice or the the or the noise gate so it might sound a little strange i apologize this is everything is just so scoffed i hope my phone's okay being hot spot i pay per gig so um uh yeah i pay i pay per gig so I wonder what we're at.

106
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:27,370
Oh my god, I'm watching the number go up.

107
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,790
Oh my god, I'm watching the number go up.

108
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,470
Guys, I might be cooked.

109
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,650
How much do you pay per gig?

110
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:42,690
Err.

111
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:43,970
$10?

112
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,350
But it caps.

113
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:48,890
It caps.

114
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,170
It caps, it caps.

115
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,910
It caps.

116
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,700
Google 5 caps at $80.

117
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,760
Quick.

118
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,460
Turn off the video.

119
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,440
Here's a kick.

120
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,340
Thank you.

121
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,720
No, no, no, no.

122
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,020
I'm just gonna get rid of the number and not think about it.

123
00:13:24,520 --> 00:15:04,320
we're just not going to think about it everybody because because i'm i wanted to be here and so that's why i made it happen because i thank you guys thank you because i you know it's i've been gone for a couple of days and i wanted to say hi and things have happened if you didn't catch the twitter space and you're like what the heck is this debut uh waiting room and what the heck is this that is looping and densetsu dot exe what is this so the the short version is the group that I was going to debut with we decided to move forward with it we're having some help backing but we are still indie um we're not corpo or anything i just have a manager now which is kind of nice but um it's just the three of us we're just gonna do our best and try and do cool things together and that's that's that's it um things are still gonna be pretty same for like all the content that i do and um uh so just probably more like you know hopefully more shows hopefully more uh opportunities um so yeah it's

124
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:15,160
steiner managing the three of us steiner is a phoebe's manager he's been managing her um he's been very nice and very helpful.

125
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,020
But, uh, underground idol group.

126
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,060
That is probably the best way to put it.

127
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,400
It's like an underground idol group.

128
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,700
Is it actually just Steiner?

129
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,520
We do have a small team.

130
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,720
But, like, Steiner is, like, our main manager.

131
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,100
So, which is kind of insane.

132
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,140
That, like, you know.

133
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,820
I've had people be like, yeah, I used to read his blogs.

134
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,480
It's like, Can you tell Steiner we said he's cute?

135
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,200
Um, sure.

136
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:52,680
Steiner's a legendary localizer.

137
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,460
I know, it's crazy, right?

138
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,440
So, are you guys going to game together too?

139
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,220
We will!

140
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,220
We will!

141
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,880
Just, you know, look forward to the three of us.

142
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,640
You know, we'll be collabing more together.

143
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,040
It's just us being fun gals.

144
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,740
So you can look forward to girls being cute girls.

145
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:45,280
as always and and a big deal is uh people you might be wondering why are they all silhouettes well one we don't want to show you the cute key visual art yet but also two vicky will be debuting completely new she is she is it's her actual debut so you know i'm the less important one here so victoria roman debut this coming friday I know,

146
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,020
finally!

147
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,740
And also, there might be some other surprises.

148
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,900
And we might, you know, we've been working on some cool stuff for you guys.

149
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,180
And of course the song.

150
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,600
Very, very excited for the song.

151
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,480
So, yeah.

152
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

153
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,740
For me, it's, you know, it says debut, but it's really just a way to kind of...

154
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:25,440
You know, it'd be, I feel like we've, I felt like it would be kind of awkward to, how do you say, every, the other two debut, but not me, you know, I'm already, I'm already just doing my thing.

155
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:35,400
Um, but, so it's more like a, like an introduction to, to Minto, reintroduction.

156
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:43,740
Yeah, so it's, it is a group debut because we are, you know, solidifying our name together.

157
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,900
there and the hall.

158
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,640

I promise.

259
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,710
Though I have thought about, like, you know, if I were to get another job.

260
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,010
You know, because I could just work in the morning and then stream at night.

261
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,230
That's what I used to do.

262
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,010
So it's nothing that I couldn't.

263
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,150

And welcome back to membership.

293
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,770
The noise gate on this is kind of insane.

294
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,170
Wait, I think it's because...

295
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,450
My computer is loud.

296
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,130
Can you hear this?

297
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,310
It's so loud.

298
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:40,090
Oh, my God.

299
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,530
I'm, like, close to the van right now.

300
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,470
And it's so loud.

301
00:29:51,380 --> 00:30:18,960
sounded like a creeper breathing wait like what kind of creeper like a minecraft creeper or what do we what do we what do we or like a kind of creeper you don't hear the fan at all oh that's great did you hear that that was the fan hold on Whoa.

302
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,000
Churn.

303
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,760
That's audible.

304
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,680
Yeah, here I'll do it again.

305
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,940
Wait, it's kind of like, it kind of gives me like ocean vibes, right?

306
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:48,200
Like you hear the ocean and it's kind of, it's kind of soothing, right?

307
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,860
Yeah.

308
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,110
It's like old TV white noise.

309
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,530
Yeah, this is pretty good.

310
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:04,470
This is pretty good.

311
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,570
Wait, should I just, when I am working on stuff, which I totally will do.

312
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:15,990
Should I just hold the mic up to the fan?

313
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,110
Huh.

314
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:27,590
It's not working now.

315
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:29,250
Okay.

316
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,760
Authentic office vibe?

317
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,360
No, no, no.

318
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:45,960
That would be like if I had like my boss coming up and being like, Hey, Minto, you got that paperwork done for me yet?

319
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,180
That would be like, oh my God, please.

320
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,900
No, I'm working on it.

321
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,740
Is that what we sound like because we are fans?

322
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,160
I think you guys sound nicer, probably.

323
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,200
10 out of 10 boss voice.

324
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,470
Hey, Minto, is that paperwork done yet?

325
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,550
What is a TPS?

326
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,330

327
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,370
Wait, TPS.

328
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,270

334
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,000
Is that a game or a movie or a show or...

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,360
It's a great movie.

336
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,640
No, I've never seen office.

337
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,360
Hold on.

338
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,140

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:00,780
Oh, right here.

340
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,960
Don't look at the numbers.

341
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,740
What am I at even?

342
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,700

343
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,920

Movie, you guys said?

348
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,200
Office space.

349
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,900
Oh, it's old.

350
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:39,450
What is this description?

351
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:46,770
Corporate drone Peter Gibbons hates his soul-killing job at software company Initech.

352
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:54,730
While undergoing hypnotherapy, Peter is left in a blissful space when his therapist dies in the middle of their session.

353
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,730
He refuses to work overtime, plays.

354
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:05,690
games at his desk and unintentionally charms two consultants into putting him on the management fast track.

355
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:15,970
When Peter's friends learn they're about to be downsized, they hatch a revenge plot against the company inspired by Superman 3.

356
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,630
What does that mean?

357
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,810
Stop reading?

358
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:23,610
Wait, why?

359
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,420
It sounds funny.

360
00:34:31,960 --> 00:35:14,000
that's a good movie oh spoilers well i don't understand what it what it means it was just a small overview there's this one office boss in office space that's your typical yeah so we're gonna need you to write those tps reports after hours thanks a lot and then he sips coffee okay it's just a bit spoiler it's okay i i don't understand it so i don't think I got spoiled at all because I've never seen Superman 3 so I've never seen Superman 3 I'm safe I'm safe

361
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,700
movie name office space

362
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:36,240
guys I'm so sleepy listen it was directed by the creator of King of the Hill Oh!

363
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,560
It's probably pretty good.

364
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,980
I am a yonder.

365
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,260
I'm sorry.

366
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,400
It's really funny.

367
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,000
Def recommend for the former office gal.

368
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,220
I've worked several offices.

369
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,260
Actually, I'd say three?

370
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,540
And then, no, four.

371
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:40,540
Four offices not four office jobs in my afterlife uh i've had many jobs i literally okay guys i don't know if i've ever said this before either but like one time i got a job at a japanese company and um i literally did that thing where the whole almost the entire interview was in japanese and but it was a japanese company in the United States.

372
00:36:48,320 --> 00:37:08,400
I literally did that thing where it's like when you, when you put your, your, when you, when you, when you put that you are Japanese, when you put, or like, you know, when you lie on your resume, I literally did that.

373
00:37:09,100 --> 00:38:02,100
interview they asked me questions and then i answered something and it totally got them on another tangent because so basically i could not understand it all like i couldn't understand like the mechanical jargon that they used but then they asked me another question and i answered that and then and then they started talking a lot and and then the interview was over and they were like okay cool you got the job i did i maybe spoke like three words to this interview

374
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:13,120
Like, I literally was just probably like, Oh, hi.

375
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,740
So this, then they were like, You're hired.

376
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,440
Literally fake it till you make it.

377
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,680
But the job was kind of hell.

378
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,680
Oh, the entire.

379
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,840
Okay, so how do I explain?

380
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,300
I was like a middle.

381
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,280
I don't really understand what I got hired to do.

382
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,980
So, like, how do I explain?

383
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,900
Okay, how do I explain?

384
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,360
It was like, okay.

385
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,320
They kind of,

386
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:18,150
it was like shipping parts to shipping, like, machine parts to other companies is like the best way.

387
00:39:18,170 --> 00:40:14,370
that i can describe it and so my job the girl who trained me trained me for a week and then she was like i'm out see ya and it was like a logistics yes yes yeah my job though was to to make guesses on how long the things would take to arrive at the at the company and I was like how do you know and she would be like well you see there's a boat and it literally is just vibes guessing the

388
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:58,890
like i'd be like okay and apparently she was like the best she could guess things down to like a day or something she was so good she was a prodigy guesser like or something and me i was like well how do you know and she was like the boat comes and i'm like okay but like yeah and she's feel it and i'm like what and so then she left and i would be stuck there like

389
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:50,490
what am i doing and and um safe to say i i didn't last very long there was like a whole spreadsheet of boats and you would have to like look at like the longitude and the latitude of the boat and then be like okay this is where the boat is at and then guess and then fill out the spreadsheet of like of like this is this is how long it will take before it's there and you had people every day And she would just,

390
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:57,710
the girl training me, she would be like, oh yeah, like Kumiko-sama, she's crazy.

391
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:02,110
She will message you, she will email you every day asking how much longer.

392
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,330
And I just subtracted a day because it's the next day.

393
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:14,530
So if it's 30 days, the next day that she emails you, you say 29.

394
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:37,270
it just works that was that was a job that i had you guys like a real job that was a real job

395
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:59,790
oh geez and they would get really mad at you if your if your predictions were not correct about how long it would take for these things to arrive.

396
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:06,770
I feel like they trolled you or something.

397
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:08,010
It was very...

398
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,590
I... It was...

399
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:12,410
It was very... It was a very strange job.

400
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:19,690
I wasn't as good as the girl that trained me.

401
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:22,850
She was a prodigy guesser.

402
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:24,350
She could just...

403
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:27,390
She, like, sensed it in her little brain.

404
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:44,390
She had, like, antenna coming out of her head that could communicate with the boat i heard fake it till you make it but never fake it till you fake some more it's uh yeah yeah

405
00:43:53,310 --> 00:44:19,470
office might be like hi so i guess like japanese was not like a super requirement but they would talk to me in in japanese and i'm like i'm i'm i'm literally slaving away at my desk literally measuring latitude and longitude of these boats and they're like konnichiwa minto san

406
00:44:22,570 --> 00:45:49,850
I'm like down to like millimeters maybe their question was hmm yeah she looks like a kankole fan you can sense the boat yeah they thought I had boat sense but the great part was it was uh it was pretty close to the old maid cafe that I was haunting so um so yeah it was uh i i i yeah i was pretty close and then it was it was a job yeah it was a job and i needed one yeah yeah and i remember i had that job and i remember applying for other jobs being like this i can't i am not a boat psychic i can't do this i don't understand i'm not the boat whisperer and so i was like putting in other job and i remember i got a i finally had gotten a job uh at another place that was like over an hour away and i took it because It was over an hour one way of a commute.

407
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:54,130
And so I took that because that's how desperate I was to get away from the boats.

408
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,410
I was desperate.

409
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:00,310
Oh, great meantle of the boat.

410
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,210
What is my numbers to win the lottery?

411
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,770
Give me your longitude and latitude right now.

412
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:05,670
And I got you, buddy.

413
00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:06,910
I got you.

414
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,390
Out of morbid curiosity, how much did this job pay?

415
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,110
Great question.

416
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,150

417
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:16,970

Enzo Mancini!

447
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:25,160
Enzo Mancini!

448
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,160
Enzo Mancini!

449
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,660
I once had a job where my manager was blatantly stealing money from the safe on camera without even thinking.

450
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:38,340
Without even trying to hide it.

451
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,600
Not sure what he was thinking.

452
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:40,680
Yeah.

453
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,940
I wish I had such a storied history.

454
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:50,500
Really?

455
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,860
I don't know.

456
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,260
I've just had a lot of jobs.

457
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:04,100
You know, uh, for as long as I can remember, you know, how to pay for my own stuff.

458
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:07,520
So, always, always working.

459
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,400
I'm just trying to get one.

460
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,480
You can do it.

461
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:17,360
You can do it.

462
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:57,580
I know that it can be really tough, especially with like how I've heard, sorry, oh my gosh, I just really, like we're talking about the j-word that's so scary we're talking about jobs but you know um but uh what's the word you they're like things right now are like so difficult because like offices will put up like ghost positions or they'll like filter through certain words or stuff like that.

463
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,560
It's kind of strange.

464
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:09,140
It's like a strange time to apply for jobs.

465
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,380
So, you know, don't be so hard on yourself if it's really tough, you know.

466
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:16,460
Hmm.

467
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,000
You know, a lot of people are having a lot of trouble.

468
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,080
So it's not just you.

469
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:23,760
It's not just you.

470
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,100

00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,540
Yeah, I'm like, why?

475
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:47,880
I also had a data entry job plumbing equipment for an aquaculture business.

476
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,280
I would also have to take the mail to the mailbox, which was down a long dirt road.

477
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,520
I would race the company dog off foot.

478
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:55,520
What?

479
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,480

Double dipping.

Don't double dip.

489
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,170
That's nasty.

490
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:50,950
You gotta be sanitary.

491
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:52,110
You gotta be sanitary.

492
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:55,190

508
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:56,800
us too what is the debut anyway you're already here oh i explained it at the beginning of the stream but i'll say it again um basically because vicky and febe are debuting i am awesome it would be kind of weird for only the two of them we're kind of like just doing it as like a formality it's really just to be like look at us you know we're we're a group now we're group together

509
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:05,360
It's kind of like, you know, just like an introduction to me.

510
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,700
So, yeah.

511
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,880
Showing camaraderie.

512
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,420
So,

513
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,570
new model.

514
00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:26,470
If only.

515
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:34,250
The debut was supposed to happen so long ago that I was...

516
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:45,270
supposed to debut my second outfit at it like that's how long ago it was supposed to happen

517
00:59:50,330 --> 00:59:51,290
so yeah

518
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:37,530
but it's okay everything i feel i feel we're you know we're just we're just chilling i mean we're not chilling we're we are working hard but almost feels like we're chilling just because it's like you know we have had a lot of time to hang out and get to know each other and we're just we're just all goofy together so to me it almost feels like chilling because i'm like i'm feeling like relaxed with them because they're my friends so

519
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:48,030
Maybe I'm just also feeling relaxed in the moment because I'm sleepy.

520
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:54,990
So I'm like, you know, I'm very excited, but I'm also like, yeah, he's cute.

521
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,310
He's cute.

522
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,250
Yeah, I'm vibing.

523
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:38,690
Yeah, so that hopefully, if that didn't explain it completely, you can listen at the beginning of the stream fun times ahead so hope you're still having fun even though it's work i'm having so much fun can't wait for you guys to see the work that is happening at the very moment but i always still feel bad that like i've been talking to other people about it recently just

524
01:01:41,710 --> 01:02:17,170
gone for when i when i leave for when i have to like you know leave my maid cafe to go do work outside like the guilt is that you know i can't stream i'm working but i can't stream so it feels like i'm not working and so it's it's like a it's like a weird you know obviously like i'm doing stuff but you won't see it for like a long time from now so oh my gosh unreal citizen thank you so much

525
01:02:21,390 --> 01:03:08,310
so it's like a strange feeling how like it's like you know i'm doing stuff but it's not streaming for me streaming always remains my number one priority and that will continue you know that's laptop when I'm traveling and things like that so even if it's like a little one hour yapping session it still is you know just something to you know talk to you guys say hi give you company if you want a background stream or anything like that so that's why I'm very let's you know it's not everybody's mindset but it's definitely my mindset

526
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:22,950
yeah yeah yes yes yes the stream refreshed me fully really talk about logistics and cheese

527
01:03:26,050 --> 01:04:27,650
but also I've talked about this with people too I feel like especially to do these kinds of yapping sessions like back when I did have my office job i would go out and i would do things and i would have stories to talk about you know it's like i can only tell my my five-year-old story so many times before you know obviously there's always going to be someone new in chat that's never heard a story before but you know there's there's only so many times i can reuse these old stories so i have to go out and and experience things so that i eyes and talk to you about you know what i mean so it's it's a bit of a balance it's a bit of a balance it's kind of like a strange thing that you know i'm also thinking about

528
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:46,720
new hauntings exactly why do you always have to stream when i'm sleeping i'm sorry that's just that's just my schedule

529
01:04:50,660 --> 01:05:01,300
gotta go live your life but I'm not living what do I I gotta go experience what it would feel like to be living

530
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:12,120
live your afterlife yeah yeah

531
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:43,080
you gotta go after live exactly just a little bit sometimes but that's also sometimes why i play so many games and don't do very many like talking streams is because i'm like oh gosh sometimes i'm you know i'm like what what what if i what if i run out of things to talk about i don't know when i play game i can talk about game

532
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:54,100
i now curse you with what did you curse me with with an interesting afterlife no

533
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:19,510
saving up stories for the winter like nuts oh my gosh i saw a fat squirrel that guy was huge i'll be like i also saw a squirrel that was in a trash can and he was like poking his head out and eating from the trash can.

534
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:23,890
And I was like, you think you're you think you're the king of this place?

535
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:25,590
Get out of there.

536
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:29,010
Squail.

537
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:34,750
Squail mentioned.

538
01:06:35,850 --> 01:06:36,290
Squail.

539
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,550
I don't know what it is.

540
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:43,750
I think those guys are funny.

541
01:06:51,130 --> 01:06:51,650
Okay.

542
01:06:54,070 --> 01:06:54,750
Good night, Minto.

543
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:55,830
Thanks for the stream.

544
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,230
Good night.

545
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:58,670
Good night.

546
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:00,790
Good night.

547
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,070
Can you say Jaguar?

548
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:03,870
Why?

549
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:07,850
Get a job as a chicken nugget expert.

550
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,050
Now, what makes an expert on chicken nuggets?

551
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:19,110
The first thing that popped into my head was like, Finding chicken nuggets that resemble shapes of things.

552
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:31,290
You know, like, I could be an expert and say, like, this chicken nugget definitely looks like a picture of Michael Jackson.

553
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,770
And people would look at it and be like, I see Michael Jackson.

554
01:07:56,330 --> 01:07:58,840
Abraham Lincoln Yes

555
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:29,290
Yes Oh my gosh That would be like a fun museum Going to a museum of preserved foods That look like Things or people But like Not like a dino nuggy that is Shaped into it But like They just took it out of the bag And bam bam Thank you ma'am That is That's Keanu Reeves.

556
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:33,310
Jesus on toast.

557
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:38,830
The Museum of Jesus toasts.

558
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,010
Where would they source these from?

559
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,730
They're all donations.

560
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:48,490
Donate to your local arts.

561
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:50,430
We're a museum.

562
01:08:51,550 --> 01:08:52,730
I'm starting this right now.

563
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:59,050
If you have ever had a food item that looks like something, Give it to me right now.

564
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:02,830
So I can preserve it in its best state.

565
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:09,810
And then display it in my museum of oddities.

566
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:14,030
Of chicken nugget shapes.

567
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,010
And other food items.

568
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:22,590
Chicken nugget shapes that look like people or things.

569
01:09:23,070 --> 01:09:25,050
And other food items.

570
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,150
That's the name of my museum.

571
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:45,350

578
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:26,290
Main exhibit.

579
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:29,510
In fact?

580
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:30,210
Oh my gosh.

581
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:32,690
Oh my gosh.

582
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:33,650
Wait, hold on.

583
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,890
What if...

584
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,670
What if you found...

585
01:10:41,330 --> 01:12:07,690
how many are there of those stone warrior statues what are they called the terracotta the terracotta's army the terracotta soldiers what if you found like what if you found like a hundred cheetos that looked like what you found 100 individual cheetos that looked like wait and each one looked like a terracotta soldier and then you displayed them that's that's just as interesting as going to the real thing no in fact i would say it's maybe more impressive because you would have to dig through hundreds of cheetos to find enough to create a terracotta army replica army next cam stream i i open i open 1 000 bags of cheetos looking for one that looks like one terracotta army soldier

586
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:21,280
the chance is not zero exactly and that's why that's why why it's going to be my mission.

587
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:33,120
I'm going to become a Terracotta Army Soldier Cheeto Soldier Finding YouTube account.

588
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,780
This is actually what my new debut is.

589
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,760
I'm rebranding.

590
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:43,860
The reason why it's a silhouette is because literally my new model is a Cheeto.

591
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:55,240
my whole new look cheeto i look like a like a gosh darn cheesy puff

592
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:56,260
rebranding stream need to get some sleep now i'm going to the Gundam base early tomorrow good night me to have fun have fun your boat guessing job amplified your psychic guessing powers you've got this thank you no well thank you so much for the pink patrick oh boy 4 a.m time for some minto drop to say hi i'm back to sleep good night mint would you accept this potato chip i just found like haley joel osman nope well and everyone says i have terrible ideas hui shut up i guess i have to accept anything But anything that resembles Haley Joel Osmond would go...

593
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:00,040
Okay, you know how Zach Baggins has his Museum of Haunted Things?

594
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:07,080
And it's like you have to sign a waiver to go in and you have to like, you know, spooky things might happen to you?

595
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:08,960
That's the same exact thing.

596
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:10,700
If you were to view...

597
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:15,740
It's like, okay, it's like you see the Haley Joel Osmond chip.

598
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:17,960
Potato chip?

599
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:37,040
it might be like the movie from the ring and you might have seven days and you might die after you look at it it's literally just basement exhibit room for haley jasmine food

600
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:53,600
it might it might just be like an actual cursed object the haley jelazment cheeto is a biohazard Yes.

601
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:58,880
Literally, to even handle it, I need to be in a hazmat suit.

602
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:01,920
Special glasses.

603
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:06,180
Haley Jalazmint Cheeto Potato Chip would belong.

604
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:08,060
That would just be an SCP.

605
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,060
What did he do to you to be cursed?

606
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:20,740
Well, his face is just a little too small for his big fat head.

607
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:22,500
And it makes me really uncomfortable.

608
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:29,800
And that's why I don't like him.

609
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:48,580
That's about it.

610
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,560
I do remember you saying that before.

611
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,420
He can't help it, give him a second chance.

612
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,080
You're streaming with Hotspot?

613
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:03,140
Oh yeah, let me see what the number is up to.

614
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,060
Oh, it's actually less than I thought.

615
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:09,420
thought.

616
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,960
I'm almost at 13 gigs.

617
01:16:12,940 --> 01:16:13,840
That's not so bad.

618
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:16,860
I started at 2.

619
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,140
So I've streamed about 11 gigs in an hour.

620
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:31,310
Yeah, actually it's not so bad.
