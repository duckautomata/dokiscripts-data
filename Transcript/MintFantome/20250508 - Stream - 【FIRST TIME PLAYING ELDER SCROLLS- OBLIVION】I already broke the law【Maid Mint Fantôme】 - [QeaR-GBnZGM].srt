1
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,020
I think... I think Nimi written.

2
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,620
Thank you!

3
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,040
I was watching earlier.

4
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:12,820
I was watching you play crossword and pokÃ©doku and... Yeah.

5
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,500
Thank you!

6
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,720
I hope you had fun!

7
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,300
I hope you had fun being big-brained.

8
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,160
Hello!

9
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,860
Oh, I need my intro.

10
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,960
Hello everybody!

11
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,740
My name is Meidominto.

12
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,460
And I'm playing Oblivion Elder Scrolls ever!

13
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,660
First time!

14
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,920
It's my first ever!

15
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,000
Elder Scrolls game!

16
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,960
So... Yeah!

17
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,480
Small Minto.

18
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,080
Yeah, today I'm Chibi Minto because...

19
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,060
I thought maybe... the game would run better.

20
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:02,040
If I'm... If I'm Chibi Minto.

21
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,480
I love you!

22
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,260
I love you!

23
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,400
I love you!

24
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,600
Yeah, so... Um...

25
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,080
Um... I'm Chibi Minto.

26
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,580
And... Um...

27
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,740
I think it'll be okay, though.

28
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,340
I think it'll be okay.

29
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,460
The game only started to kind of...

30
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,340
poop itself after a little while of me playing.

31
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,460
Hehehehe...

32
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,420
Hehehehe...

33
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,460
Hehehehe...

34
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,520
Hehehehe...

35
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:40,760
Hehehehe...

36
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:46,700
I...

37
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,420
I'm excited to...

38
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,100
Guys!

39
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,720
I'm kinda... I'm kinda concerned.

40
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,120
Do I have a bounty on my head for breaking the law or...

41
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,700
Um... Wait, that's?

42
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,260
Oh.

43
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,480
All I did was borrow a horse.

44
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,720
Like, in-game.

45
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,560
Yeah, of course, in-game.

46
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,020
What do you think I'm doing, huh?

47
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,780
I only borrowed a horse.

48
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,980
And... it's not my fault that guy fell... tripped and fell on my sword.

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,620
Wait, I don't have a sword.

50
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,080
On my arrows?

51
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,100
Did you go get your yogurt?

52
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,290
I went to the yogurt place.

53
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,810
So, after Devil May Cry, I said, I'm gonna go get yogurt.

54
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,450
That was my motivation.

55
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:02,070
I was like, okay, I beat Devil May Cry, I'm gonna go get yogurt.

56
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,090
And I drove.

57
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,150
I went there.

58
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,850
It's 30 minutes there, 30 minutes back.

59
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,790
So, I was like, I'm gonna go get yogurt.

60
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,330
It's a new yogurt place.

61
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,350
And I was like, I'm really in there.

62
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,230
I love yogurt.

63
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,690
So, I always wanna get some yogurt.

64
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,370
I always wanna try a yogurt place.

65
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,770
And I went.

66
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,730
And I got there.

67
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,170
And I walked in.

68
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,970
And it said, orders closed 10 minutes ago.

69
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,750
So, they weren't closed.

70
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,290
But they were not taking any more orders.

71
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:51,690
So, honestly, how could I have known that?

72
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:52,950
Which is even...

73
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,590
Like, it's one thing...

74
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,770
It would be one thing if I, like, didn't check the times.

75
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,350
And they were closed.

76
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,050
And I was like, oh shoot, that's my fault.

77
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,110
I should've...

78
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:06,450
I should've checked the times that they were closed.

79
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,730
But no.

80
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,990
Instead, they closed their orders a whole hour.

81
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,130
A whole hour before they closed.

82
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,110
I was like, come on, man.

83
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,550
Come on, man.

84
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,990
So, I haven't been back.

85
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,070
Yeah, I felt so scammed.

86
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,530
Cause I was like, I drove a whole half hour.

87
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,150
I've wasted a whole hour of my afterlife.

88
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,450
Going to try and get yogurt.

89
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,670
I just wanted yogurt.

90
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,190
I wanted specialty yogurt.

91
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,730
Oh, well.

92
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,190
Oh, well.

93
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,590
I would say live and learn, but I'm dead.

94
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,110
So, I don't learn nothing.

95
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,930
I don't learn anything.

96
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,730
For those who did not see me play before...

97
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,890
Also, I don't know why, but it feels like the...

98
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,130
What's it called?

99
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,870
The sensitivity is so low.

100
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,770
I tried adjusting it, but...

101
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,210
I don't think it did anything.

102
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,590
I don't know.

103
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,990
I don't know.

104
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:23,770
But...

105
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,190
We made E-Tina.

106
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,210
Oh, I spelled Tina wrong before.

107
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,350
Oops.

108
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:30,910
That's fine.

109
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,310
Have you seen any new characters?

110
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,250
I haven't seen yet!

111
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,590
It feels low as hell in this game.

112
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,450
Keep messing with it.

113
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,130
I literally made it like...

114
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,370
Almost Mac.

115
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,250
I guess...

116
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,550
This is the sensitivity, no?

117
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,110
Says keyboard and mouse.

118
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,670
So, I like...

119
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,250
I almost maxed it.

120
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,570
Pinky yogurt tax.

121
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,090
Thank you!

122
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,770
Stop.

123
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,110
You violated the law.

124
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,250
I mean, I did do that.

125
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,290
Let me try.

126
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,730
Let's see if this changes anything.

127
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,810
I can't tell.

128
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,570
Like, it feels like it's lagging.

129
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,090
I don't know.

130
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,910
Adjust my DPI.

131
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,350
It's fine when I'm...

132
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,470
When I'm not in the game.

133
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,730
It's only...

134
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,490
And I'm in the window.

135
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,250
It's not my...

136
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,070
It's not my mouse.

137
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,750
It's the game.

138
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:26,890
Hmm...

139
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,410
In-game and menu might be different.

140
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:28,970
Maybe...

141
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,130
What if I'm like upping it so crazy?

142
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,770
And we get in the game and we're like...

143
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,790
I'm getting my whiplash.

144
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:37,730
Luna, hello!

145
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,190
Thank you so much for a whole year!

146
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:39,770
Thank you!

147
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,390
Thank you, thank you.

148
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,350
I'll turn it down some.

149
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,730
We'll turn it to like...

150
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,550
70.

151
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,550
And then I can always turn it up.

152
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,910
Cause it was at 50.

153
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,670
We'll just do that.

154
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:55,590
Okay.

155
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,390
But let's load the game.

156
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,410
Eat Tina.

157
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,030
You guys have to see...

158
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,910
My really beautiful...

159
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,230
Oh!

160
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,150
I killed a guy and I'm gonna join the darkness!

161
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,370
I'm really excited about that.

162
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,420
You guys have to see Eat Tina.

163
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:14,700
Okay.

164
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,720
I don't remember...

165
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,320
Oh!

166
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,020
Actually, it's not bad at all.

167
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:19,720
The uh...

168
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,860
The sensitivity.

169
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,020
Yeah!

170
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,580
It's actually...

171
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:25,860
Okay.

172
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,420
I can open all of these, right?

173
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,460
I can just look.

174
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,120
No one's in here.

175
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,220
Okay.

176
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,360
I can sit...

177
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,940
Let me show you guys...

178
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,820
Eat Tina.

179
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,180
Eat Tina!

180
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,900
Everybody!

181
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,860
She's just as beautiful...

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,060
As I remember.

183
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,440
So there's a scene in E.T.

184
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,700
When E.T.

185
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,780
dresses up...

186
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,100
Isn't this a lady?

187
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,380
Just Google E.T.

188
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,140
And you'll see...

189
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,640
And you'll see...

190
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,470
You'll see...

191
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,070
It looks exactly like this.

192
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,890
I think I did the best job I ever could have done.

193
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,010
How do I get up?

194
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:13,910
Wait.

195
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:14,970
Stand up.

196
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:15,790
Tina.

197
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:16,610
Tina.

198
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,470
Eat...

199
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,170
Okay, there we go.

200
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,290
Eat Tina.

201
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:21,770
Um...

202
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,150
E.T.

203
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:22,750
for short.

204
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,470
What's in here?

205
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,350
Okay.

206
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,070
A broom...

207
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,930
There's some gold.

208
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,910
Do you think anybody would know if I stole?

209
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,970
A shovel?

210
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,090
That sounds useful.

211
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,810
And like...

212
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,250
Cheese?

213
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,330
They won't...

214
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,070
They won't notice.

215
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,130
Probably.

216
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:43,750
Covered pot.

217
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,190
I have to be careful not to steal everything though.

218
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,690
I...

219
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,940
That's really nice!

220
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,870
A burgundy linen shirt?

221
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,450
Wait.

222
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,550
How do I open my...

223
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,090
Is it tab?

224
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:56,650
No.

225
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,870
How do I open my inventory again?

226
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,390
I...

227
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,450
This is what we're looking like right now.

228
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:06,570
What am I wearing?

229
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,030
We're E.T.

230
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,530
We're a wood elf.

231
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,970
And we're also a thief.

232
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,850
I wear the sneet class.

233
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,130
She's got hands.

234
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,050
Yeah.

235
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,670
She do.

236
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,530
Wait.

237
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,250
What am I wearing?

238
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,390
I'm wearing a rough...

239
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:24,970
Leather...

240
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,870
Cure ass.

241
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,590
It's...

242
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,030
Probably...

243
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,630
But this is really nice.

244
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:38,430
We could wear this to a fancy dinner party, I think.

245
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,970
I'm gonna take it.

246
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,330
If...

247
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,710
If anybody wanted it, they wouldn't put it in a barrel.

248
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:46,330
Wait.

249
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,410
Let's see what it looks like.

250
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:50,790
See?

251
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,110
Wait!

252
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,090
Oh my gosh!

253
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,230
That's so nice!

254
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,210
Meet the Q.

255
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:01,830
Thank you!

256
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,830
Oh, sorry.

257
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:05,510
Food...

258
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,070
Mogging my Oshi.

259
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,310
What do you mean?

260
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,830
What do you mean?

261
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,350
Oh!

262
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,350
The yogurt?

263
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,030
Yeah.

264
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,930
Oh, wow!

265
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,470
This is so beautiful.

266
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:18,690
Everybody...

267
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,590
Everybody would be like...

268
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,370
Yeah, Tina!

269
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,230
You're...

270
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,570
You're so stunning today.

271
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,270
Oh my gosh!

272
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:28,670
Oh my gosh!

273
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,250
Nobody's gonna notice.

274
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,870
I definitely don't think I have a bounty.

275
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,530
On my head.

276
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,470
I don't think so.

277
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,750
It's the night time.

278
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,150
Alright.

279
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:48,970
I gotta...

280
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,130
Wait.

281
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,030
Can you guys...

282
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,330
Wait.

283
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:52,990
I'll figure it out.

284
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,470
Hold on.

285
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:55,630
Quests.

286
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,150
Let's see what we're up against.

287
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,510
We gotta...

288
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,810
We gotta find the heir.

289
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,970
Yeah, that's right.

290
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,030
I gotta go to...

291
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,950
This place.

292
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,850
Phone home.

293
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,130
Phone home.

294
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,850
E.T.

295
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,730
Phone home.

296
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:22,950
Joffrey told me that the Emperor has an illegitimate son named Martin, who is currently serving as a priest in the chapel of Akatosh in the city of...

297
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:24,690
Kvatch.

298
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,110
I must proceed to...

299
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:32,940
Kvatch at once and bring Martin safely back to Waynan Priory.

300
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,230
Yes, yes.

301
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,430
And then this, I gotta go kill a guy.

302
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,150
Oh wait, no.

303
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,730
This is the people that were killed.

304
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,510
Find the heir.

305
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,510
That's what we're doing.

306
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,130
Wait.

307
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:47,910
What's the...

308
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,470
What's the difference?

309
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,150
Oh!

310
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,490
Is this like our overarching quest?

311
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,430
No!

312
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,030
Wait, no.

313
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,750
This is the one.

314
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:56,990
The knife in the dark.

315
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,990
Caught on the...

316
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,450
Caught up on the VODs.

317
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,610
Thank you for watching!

318
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:09,670
I said this one several months ago, but I can imagine your TV model design is a design for a sugar cookie.

319
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,110
Are you saying I'm sweet?

320
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,970
I've been feeling extreme cuteness aggression whenever I watch Minto.

321
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,190
I don't think you can cure that, huh?

322
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,250
Um...

323
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,370
I think...

324
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,330
You're doomed.

325
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,430
Terminal.

326
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,390
Hehehehe.

327
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,090
Hehehehe.

328
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:34,530
What's this one?

329
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,550
Seeking your roots.

330
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:36,370
Oh!

331
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,310
The nerd root.

332
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:40,330
Um...

333
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,530
This one is the Dark Brotherhood.

334
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:45,170
We gotta go to the Inn of Ill Omen.

335
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,350
Which, I mean, you kind of deserve it for hanging out at an inn called that, no?

336
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,450
I think you might deserve death if you hang out at an inn of Ill Omen.

337
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,150
Certainly something bad is bound to happen there.

338
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,550
So...

339
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,310
Sorry, Rufio!

340
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:02,910
We just...

341
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,170
We just gotta go get that guy.

342
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,630
Hehehehe.

343
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,850
It used to be a nice place.

344
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,110
Well...

345
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,710
They've...

346
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,090
They've...

347
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,850
They've let it go into the pooper.

348
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:16,630
The...

349
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,210
The owners.

350
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,590
Hehehehe.

351
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,610
They...

352
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,550
In fact, I think...

353
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,330
What if they are trying to attract...

354
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,530
You know how, like, some hotels will...

355
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:27,550
Say that they are haunted to attract...

356
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,510
Um...

357
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,070
Like, paranormal investigators?

358
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,830
What if they're calling it the Inn of Ill Omen to attract, like...

359
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,650
You know...

360
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,630
The ruffians.

361
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,070
And...

362
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,130
And such.

363
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,370
Some real kinds.

364
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:43,170
Hehehehe.

365
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:43,570
Hehehehe.

366
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,470
The freaks!

367
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,510
The freaks?

368
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,450
Bow bow!

369
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:51,970
Hehehehe.

370
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:52,370
Okay.

371
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,910
Can I...

372
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,470
Um...

373
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,590
Put this on like a...

374
00:16:58,870 --> 00:16:59,410
How...

375
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,210
What do these mean?

376
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,430
We have to activate quests?

377
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,510
Well, tell me where to go.

378
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:02,710
Oh!

379
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,410
Open a map.

380
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:05,310
Oh!

381
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,410
Oh!

382
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:06,730
Wait, where am I?

383
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,270
Wait, oh.

384
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,550
Where am I?

385
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:10,890
Where?

386
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,230
Where am I?

387
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,190
Oh no, I'm lost!

388
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:13,950
Wait.

389
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:14,730
Hehehehe.

390
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:15,550
Oh, there!

391
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,150
Wow, that's far!

392
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,770
We're up here!

393
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,770
We gotta go all the way down here?

394
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,490
Holy cannoli!

395
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,010
Okay.

396
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,390
I can just go through the mountains.

397
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,190
Right?

398
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,350
What?

399
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,510
You can fast travel.

400
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:34,490
But where's the fun in that?

401
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,190
Oh yeah!

402
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,210
We have a horse now!

403
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,690
So true!

404
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,930
Where's the fun in fast travel?

405
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,550
I gotta...

406
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,270
I gotta get used to these...

407
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,690
To these parts, you guys.

408
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,610
I don't know anything.

409
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,110
Hehehehe.

410
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:49,430
I'll fast travel maybe in the future.

411
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,170
But I wanna see the world right now.

412
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,790
Oh wait!

413
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,410
Is this not Kvatch?

414
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:54,850
Is this where we need to go?

415
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,350
What's this one then?

416
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,590
Pilgrim?

417
00:17:58,990 --> 00:17:59,370
Hmm?

418
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:01,470
No.

419
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,670
No, no, no, no.

420
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:03,530
Wait.

421
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,470
Um...

422
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,550
Where's my horse?

423
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,030
Where's my horse?

424
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,030
Horse!

425
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,830
My horse that I borrowed?

426
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,610
For our great adventure?

427
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:20,610
Horse!

428
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,190
That was given to me by the late emperor.

429
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,950
As his spirit possessed me and told me...

430
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,450
That I have a horse.

431
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:34,650
You will get a horse that isn't stolen.

432
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,870
Mine's not stolen.

433
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,510
It's borrowed.

434
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,150
Wait, he left?

435
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,150
There's no way.

436
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:41,530
Oh.

437
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:43,550
Uh...

438
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,730
Did I ever loot this guy?

439
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,130
I didn't!

440
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,070
He's got some...

441
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,290
I can literally...

442
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,070
I can literally...

443
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,530
I can take his pantaloons.

444
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:54,890
Wait.

445
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:55,790
If I...

446
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,890
If I take all of his clothes...

447
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:58,690
Okay, hold on.

448
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,870
We're gonna make it look like this is only the works of a real...

449
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,650
Of a real like, you know, freak out here.

450
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,570
So I'm gonna take all his clothes.

451
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:09,610
Oh gosh, I'm heavy.

452
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,790
I'm gonna move them over here.

453
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,610
And then they're gonna be like...

454
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,970
There's some freaker out here...

455
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,270
Who's killing people and stripping them of their clothes!

456
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:19,790
And then...

457
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,410
They will never suspect E-Tina.

458
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,770
Who...

459
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,670
Who could...

460
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,970
Who could ever suspect such a...

461
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,250
Sweet looking...

462
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,610
Flower child?

463
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,170
Nobody.

464
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:34,970
Alright.

465
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,590
Now let's get rid of...

466
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,590
Let's get rid of everything.

467
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,430
Look at her!

468
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,690
She could never...

469
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,250
She would never rob a man and then...

470
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,370
Wait.

471
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:44,730
It's...

472
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,350
Drop.

473
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,470
Oh, nope.

474
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,110
Legion.

475
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,790
Legion.

476
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:50,830
Legion.

477
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,270
Rusty iron...

478
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,850
Are these mine?

479
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,810
I just took off her pants!

480
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,730
Oh my god!

481
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,430
Put them back on E-Tina!

482
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,010
What are you doing girl?

483
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,190
I don't want the helmet either.

484
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,850
It's ugly.

485
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,130
Okay.

486
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,030
Okay.

487
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,410
Indecent.

488
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:09,770
Indeed.

489
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,470
Okay.

490
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,650
Alright.

491
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,050
Now the...

492
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:15,570
Can I...

493
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,670
Can I carry...

494
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:18,490
Can I carry this guy?

495
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:19,830
Or...

496
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,690
How do I fight again?

497
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:22,650
I don't remember.

498
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,150
Oh golly.

499
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,190
Okay.

500
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,770
I have a...

501
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,170
If I equip my bow...

502
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,370
Oh, that's it.

503
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,430
I just have to equip it.

504
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:31,770
Okay.

505
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,790
Blade of woe?

506
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,490
Wait.

507
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,430
Was this given to me?

508
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:47,620
Yes.

509
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:47,920
Okay.

510
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,980
Oh, I forgot the shield.

511
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,980
Okay, hold on.

512
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,340
Get rid of all the evidence.

513
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,620
Except the body, apparently.

514
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,940
Except the body.

515
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,200
They could be like, what?

516
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,280
Actually, they might even just see this and think that he was some crazy drunk.

517
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,200
They're just like...

518
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh.

519
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:14,500
Oh.

520
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,640
Oh, good morning.

521
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,420
Hello.

522
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,260
Talk.

523
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,360
Um...

524
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,000
Assistance.

525
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,180
Oh, rumors.

526
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,760
I'd like to learn more about spell casting.

527
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:28,500
Might have to head over to the mages guild and see if they're accepting new members.

528
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,360
I see.

529
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,440
Uh, assistance.

530
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Well, I normally stay out of the affairs of the great folk that come through Wainon Priory to see Master Joffrey.

531
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,960
But go ahead and take this hammer.

532
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,460
You might have use of it.

533
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,640
And I have others.

534
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,180
Not much call for smith work around here in any case.

535
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,020
Well, we both have better things to do than stand here all day exchanging idle gossip.

536
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,280
Okay.

537
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,520
Good day to you now.

538
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,880
Good day to you now.

539
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,860
Good day to you now.

540
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,720
I got a hammer.

541
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,480
Nice.

542
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,500
Let's see if we can get a horse then.

543
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,000
Free hammer.

544
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,560
Good morning.

545
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,220
Oh, priests.

546
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,240
Wow.

547
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,160
I stayed in your cottage and there was no food.

548
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,760
Wait, where are they?

549
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,280
Oh, they're asleep.

550
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,860
Wake up.

551
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,400
Good morning.

552
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,320
Yes.

553
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,180
Oh.

554
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,040
Sir, my eyes are down here.

555
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,380
Oh, golly.

556
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,730
Assistant.

557
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,250
Perhaps you will find this useful.

558
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:40,290
One of the books I saved from my blade strength.

559
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,010
You go into danger.

560
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:46,970
Joffrey didn't tell us any more than that, but know that our prayers go with you.

561
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:47,730
Thank you.

562
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,330
What about Joffrey?

563
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:50,750
Oh, yes.

564
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:52,730
He'll be in the priory house somewhere.

565
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,910
Don't look down.

566
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:57,070
He's embarrassed about my t-shirt.

567
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:02,810
He's like, I must not look upon thy bosom.

568
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,190
E, Tina, you are...

569
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,250
E, Tina, I cannot look at a woman until 12 PM.

570
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,620
Okay.

571
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,260
Thank you.

572
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,180
Thank you.

573
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,420
Thank you.

574
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:20,920
Oh, look up.

575
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:21,440
Good day.

576
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,020
Good day.

577
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,700
Is he gonna go back to sleep, you think?

578
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,580
Oh, no.

579
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,720
He's permanently cross-eyed.

580
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,020
Oh.

581
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,240
Good night.

582
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,900
What about you?

583
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,520
Can I get a horse from you, please?

584
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,840
I know that you are on an important mission for the blades.

585
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,860
Please, if you need a horse, take mine from the priory stable.

586
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,560
Oh, my gosh.

587
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,480
Thank you.

588
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,780
That's a generous offer.

589
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,000
Go with Talos's blessings.

590
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,600
Do not fail.

591
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,600
Do not fail.

592
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,540
Good night.

593
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,120
I woke him up.

594
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,220
Thank you.

595
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,000
Here, I'm gonna...

596
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,400
I'll keep watch over you guys.

597
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,960
My two little brothers.

598
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,720
All right, let's go get our horse.

599
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,260
Oh, I wonder where our horse is, though.

600
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,760
Where did our horse go?

601
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,940
They think I can just take it now.

602
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,760
Which one is his?

603
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,060
Oh.

604
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,140
Okay, definitely not...

605
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,980
Oh, okay, okay.

606
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,720
Oh, way none prior...

607
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,300
He gets...

608
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:33,980
They get two.

609
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,480
All right, I get the one.

610
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:36,940
All right.

611
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:38,160
Red.

612
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,940
Okay, now if I look at the map...

613
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,420
I go to Kvatch, no?

614
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,600
Oh, this is for...

615
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,100
Oh, okay.

616
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,940
That's why it was telling me to go to Anvil.

617
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,700
Okay, no, no, no, no.

618
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,140
We're going to Kvatch.

619
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,160
Wait.

620
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:00,900
Uh, uh...

621
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,100
Find the air.

622
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

623
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,020
I didn't realize I had to select the quest.

624
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,080
Okay, that makes so much more sense.

625
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,720
That way!

626
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,760
Okay, horse.

627
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,000
We're going...

628
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,220
Very slow.

629
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,720
Back it up, horse.

630
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,940
Back it up.

631
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,900
Boop.

632
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:24,960
Boop.

633
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,060
Boop.

634
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,100
Boop.

635
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,560
Yes.

636
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,760
Oh, yes.

637
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Oh, yes.

638
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:37,880
Oh, yes.

639
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,300
All right.

640
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:38,760
Horse.

641
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,500
Back it up.

642
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,020
Back it up, please.

643
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:41,820
Oh, please.

644
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,580
Turn around.

645
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,300
Horse.

646
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,700
Horse.

647
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,320
Oh, gosh.

648
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,640
Okay.

649
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,860
There we go!

650
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,500
And we're off!

651
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,140
Hi-yah!

652
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,300
Actually, I kind of want to look around the area and see if my horse is around here.

653
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,280
You know?

654
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,000
Wait.

655
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,480
What was that?

656
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,360
How do I get off?

657
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,060
There we go.

658
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,360
Don't!

659
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,320
Don't!

660
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:03,740
Don't!

661
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,160
Don't leave!

662
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,240
What was...

663
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:05,960
What did I just say?

664
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,000
I thought I saw some evidence.

665
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,550
Nothing.

666
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:16,850
ET?

667
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,230
Well, actually, it's ET now.

668
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,770
Wow.

669
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:25,970
It's so beautiful!

670
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,130
ET phone home.

671
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:32,870
Oh, stables.

672
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,490
I could have gotten a horse from here.

673
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,250
Look at that.

674
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:39,930
There's plenty of free horses here.

675
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,780
What did they want me to do?

676
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,800
Just run the whole way?

677
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:47,580
Hold on.

678
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,440
What's that?

679
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,260
Wait, those are deer.

680
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,220
That's not my horse.

681
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,520
Alright.

682
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,780
Horse, turn around.

683
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,900
Yeah, they're free.

684
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,200
Whoa!

685
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,640
Oh my god!

686
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,200
Is that the moon?

687
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,220
Crazy.

688
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:18,750
Okay.

689
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,270
Which way am I going?

690
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:20,730
This way.

691
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,470
Have a rough day at work.

692
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,170
I'll catch them on.

693
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,230
Have...

694
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,450
Have a nice day!

695
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,550
Thank you!

696
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,310
One of them.

697
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,810
Can my horse get hurt?

698
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,750
Oh, I'm at a fort.

699
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,890
There's a fort here.

700
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,950
I don't see a fort.

701
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,790
No, horse.

702
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,310
Don't do that.

703
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,870
What should we name our horse?

704
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,270
What the heck was that?

705
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:56,770
Just heard a mysterious sound.

706
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,390
I should have probably studied on the path, huh?

707
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,350
Oh, golly.

708
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,050
Oh, golly.

709
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:02,310
Okay.

710
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:03,270
Be careful, horse.

711
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:06,430
Uh...

712
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,410
Here's the path.

713
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:08,210
Here's the path.

714
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,430
What's that red light down there?

715
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,390
Uh...

716
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:16,910
Uh...

717
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:19,690
Someone's making breakfast?

718
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,870
What is that?

719
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,370
Let's go investigate.

720
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes!

721
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,760
Where are we?

722
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,200
Oh, we're at the fort!

723
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,380
Oh...

724
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:40,900
Oh...

725
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,120
What the?

726
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,900
Oh my god.

727
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,280
No, leave my...

728
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,400
Hold on.

729
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,060
I can't remember how to...

730
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,300
Quickly equip my bow.

731
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,320
Leave my horse alone!

732
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,760
Wait.

733
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,160
Leave my horse alone!

734
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:58,900
Ah!

735
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,440
Leave my horse alone!

736
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,280
You're okay, horse.

737
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,350
Are you okay, horse?

738
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,190
Nasty.

739
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:21,050
Wait.

740
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,150
What's that up there?

741
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,590
Is that a person?

742
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,350
Nasty rats.

743
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,390
Why are there such big rats everywhere?

744
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,090
Oh, no.

745
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:28,830
Is that a dungeon?

746
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:31,190
Wait.

747
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:31,770
Is there a...

748
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,050
Oh, yeah.

749
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:32,790
That's how I sneak.

750
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:33,490
That's right.

751
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:33,790
Okay.

752
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:35,850
Nice!

753
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,010
How do I get up there?

754
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,170
I did get the crazy jump.

755
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,090
Uh...

756
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,070
Uh...

757
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,350
Uh...

758
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:48,610
Okay, never mind.

759
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,190
Hold on.

760
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:50,570
Oh my gosh!

761
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,790
Planet Mike, thank you so much for the 50 gift!

762
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:53,450
Thank you!

763
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,270
Holy...

764
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,230
Holy moly...

765
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,090
Thank you so much!

766
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,310
Alright.

767
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,870
Maybe I can jump from here.

768
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,290
Retina!

769
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,470
Oh sh...

770
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:10,890
Oh gosh...

771
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,330
What were you thinking, girl?

772
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,650
Can you climb the ropes?

773
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,950
No?

774
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:16,530
Okay.

775
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,070
It's fine.

776
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,890
She's getting her... her vigor back.

777
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,730
She's just old.

778
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,590
I got old knees.

779
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,290
There's just a guy up there.

780
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,110
I want to loot him.

781
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,510
Oh well.

782
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:31,950
Okay.

783
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,090
I wanna... I wanna make sure that we get to the place.

784
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,810
I don't wanna do some dungeons for now.

785
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,790
We did our first one before.

786
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,910
That was fun, though.

787
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,570
Alien knees.

788
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:45,890
Broken ankles.

789
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,370
Where am I?

790
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:49,750
Wait, this... looks deserted.

791
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:50,590
Hack dirt.

792
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,790
Um... Is that... good, or...?

793
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,890
Wait, I need to go through hack dirt.

794
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,270
Does anyone live here?

795
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,510
Wait, there's lights on.

796
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,810
Why does this town look so gross?

797
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,850
Oh...

798
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,590
Uh...

799
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,930
Hello?

800
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,010
Moslin's dry goods.

801
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,790
Okay, we got a store.

802
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,170
Moslin's in.

803
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,770
The water's all dried up.

804
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,110
Hello?

805
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,070
Oh!

806
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:30,810
Oh, dang it.

807
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,330
I forgot how to do it.

808
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,670
I was too slow.

809
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:42,510
Ow!

810
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,370
It's okay, I have 36 lockpicks left.

811
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,150
Nice.

812
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,960
It's a hillbilly town.

813
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,400
Yee-haw!

814
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,580
You could wait until morning.

815
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,820
Oh, you think they'll be open then?

816
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,660
Uh...

817
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,200
Surely the inn is open.

818
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,100
Oh, see?

819
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,260
Oh...

820
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:24,340
Good morning.

821
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,040
Oh...

822
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,140
There's nobody here.

823
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,400
What is this?

824
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,160
Full of ale?

825
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,700
Oh, wait!

826
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,600
This is not illegal.

827
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,500
Huh...

828
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,480
Why not?

829
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:40,780
Oh!

830
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:43,680
Uh...

831
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,920
Go, man.

832
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,480
Lewud, what did you do?

833
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,900
What did you do?

834
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,020
Thank you for the...

835
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:54,920
Hakusupa!

836
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:55,540
What did you do?

837
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,840
Imagine being born in a place called Hector.

838
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:01,040
I kind of want to see what's in this person's room.

839
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,700
Can I peek in through the crack?

840
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,540
No?

841
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,620
Oh, maybe?

842
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,740
Can you see in there?

843
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,020
Where is everybody in this town?

844
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:18,980
Huh?

845
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,620
I'm looking around still for a second.

846
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,960
I want to see what else is...

847
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,280
Why is there nobody here?

848
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,680
Wait.

849
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,560
Guys, how do I put my weapon away?

850
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,340
I don't want people to think I'm...

851
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,740
I'm...

852
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm naughty.

853
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,980
F.

854
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,820
Oh.

855
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,560
F.

856
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,720
Thank you!

857
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,380
Natch Pinder's house.

858
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,180
Oh my gosh.

859
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,000
Everybody locks their doors here.

860
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,900
I have a friend.

861
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,720
If she ever comes over...

862
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,240
Whenever she comes over...

863
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,180
She...

864
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:07,220
Purposefully tries to break into my house to make sure I'm locking my door.

865
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,530
It's night time.

866
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:15,830
Oh, but...

867
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,250
It's so bright out.

868
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,930
Bible of the deep ones.

869
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:21,410
Oh.

870
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,530
Oh no, I can't read.

871
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:23,550
Uh oh.

872
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,270
Oh no.

873
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,390
Alien language.

874
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,010
Given to me by the chief of the deep ones.

875
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,110
He taught me his language and his runes.

876
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,250
This is the ancient lore of his people...

877
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,450
Which we shall follow from now until forever.

878
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:39,030
Signed in the presence of twelve witnesses.

879
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,630
Urlov Moselin.

880
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,610
Mm-hmm.

881
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,840
I see.

882
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,240
I see.

883
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,320
I think it's a cult.

884
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,280
I think it might be a cult.

885
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,900
Do you think the people will be upset with me if I break into their rooms in the inn?

886
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,580
I might be a little excited about a...

887
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,440
About an extraterrestrial visitor.

888
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,380
What's this?

889
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,000
Caverns?

890
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,700
Oh my goodness.

891
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,480
It's a hard block to pick though.

892
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,180
Vivico, I think you're the gifted dequeue.

893
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:25,740
Let's...

894
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,280
Let's try.

895
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,640
Let's try getting into the person's room.

896
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,580
What are they gonna do?

897
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,060
Wake up?

898
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,020
I'll be really quiet.

899
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,670
Wait.

900
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,390
Is anybody in here?

901
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,470
There's nobody in here.

902
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:58,410
I could sleep in here.

903
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,690
There's an iron mace in here?

904
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,450
Hello?

905
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,550
Is there somebody hiding behind the...

906
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:06,890
The curtain?

907
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:07,310
No?

908
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:12,600
Let's just have a bunch of bone meal.

909
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,140
Yeah.

910
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,060
Okay.

911
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,860
Where's the loot?

912
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,780
Maybe in here.

913
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,060
Wow.

914
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,120
Nothing.

915
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,780
We got some parchment.

916
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,220
Nothing else.

917
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,360
What was the point?

918
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,280
Hmm.

919
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,140
I could take the iron mace.

920
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
It's kind of heavy though.

921
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,740
Oh well.

922
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,180
Stealing is bad.

923
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,600
It doesn't say I'm stealing.

924
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,620
I don't think anybody lives here.

925
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:47,920
Oh.

926
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,420
I lied.

927
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:49,960
Oh.

928
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,540
I lied.

929
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:51,680
Uh.

930
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,420
Wait.

931
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:52,920
What are you doing?

932
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:53,940
Oh.

933
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:54,360
Hello.

934
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:54,860
Oh.

935
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:55,600
Um.

936
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,220
Hi.

937
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,360
Where did you come from?

938
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,280
Oh.

939
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,460
Where did you come from?

940
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,750
I didn't steal anything.

941
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,290
Oh.

942
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,520
There was a ghost goblin behind you.

943
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,080
Oh.

944
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,100
Where did you come from?

945
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,640
Conjurer.

946
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,940
Isn't that an evil guy though?

947
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,200
Snowball tome.

948
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,580
Gold rimmed shoes.

949
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,160
He's blinged out.

950
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,660
I think we'll take that.

951
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:41,730
Oh.

952
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,690
Hello sir.

953
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,350
I saved you, didn't I?

954
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,210
Let me give you some advice, stranger.

955
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:47,970
Leave.

956
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:48,670
Now.

957
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,450
You ain't welcome here.

958
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,810
I killed your guests.

959
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,990
Gray fox.

960
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,010
I forgot about that.

961
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:56,590
My grandfather built this place.

962
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,250
Not that it's any of your business.

963
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,170
We've been down.

964
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,170
But we got plans to bring back the good old days.

965
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,510
You'll see.

966
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,590
Mm-hmm.

967
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,710
I guess we've got a room available.

968
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,570
30 gold per night.

969
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,250
Ah, no thanks.

970
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:11,910
Take it or leave it.

971
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,670
I hacked, actually, the door.

972
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,730
I wall hacked in.

973
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:15,370
No, thank you.

974
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,050
Then stop wasting my time.

975
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,850
Okay.

976
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,630
I thought you wanted to make this place amazing.

977
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,230
Go bother someone else.

978
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,630
He's so rude.

979
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,290
Wait, can I persuade you?

980
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,470
Go on.

981
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:27,530
Hold on.

982
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,130
I'm going to do a little bit of a persuading.

983
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,630
Totally not a cult town.

984
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:31,870
What?

985
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:33,230
Um.

986
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,230
Okay, how do I do this again?

987
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,230
Alright, so we got to...

988
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,390
We got to make him happy.

989
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:47,170
He loves being coerced.

990
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:50,050
He just likes being boasted.

991
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,950
Hates a joke.

992
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,810
Even more hates being admired.

993
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:56,490
Okay, wait.

994
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,930
So, you do this in the order...

995
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,230
Where there's...

996
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,470
The least amount of...

997
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,010
Oh.

998
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,850
A least amount of...

999
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,770
What's it called, right?

1000
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,730
It hit zero.

1001
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,710
Oh, it went from 99 to zero.

1002
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,190
Uh.

1003
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,410
Can I leave?

1004
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:18,750
Don't.

1005
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,270
Please.

1006
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,150
I'm sorry.

1007
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,790
I wish I could say that.

1008
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:23,550
Heh.

1009
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,010
I wish I could say that.

1010
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,090
That's just not...

1011
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,090
Oh, I think I messed up.

1012
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,270
Don't talk such rot.

1013
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:30,110
Oh, sorry.

1014
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:30,550
Okay.

1015
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,410
Are you serious?

1016
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:32,910
Sorry.

1017
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:33,870
I'm not...

1018
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:35,270
I'm from a different planet.

1019
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,930
I don't have very good people skills.

1020
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,690
Go bother someone else.

1021
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:40,950
Okay, Mr. Moslin.

1022
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,230
I protected you.

1023
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,490
But I'll leave.

1024
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,010
You think my horse is still out here?

1025
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,590
Oh, gosh.

1026
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,790
Mint the Rizlis.

1027
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,270
I don't think I understand it yet.

1028
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,090
Get my bow and arrow out just in case.

1029
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:57,890
Wait, we can go in here now, right?

1030
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:02,660
No?

1031
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,400
It's not open?

1032
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,240
Oh, you scared me.

1033
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,280
Um...

1034
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,040
Was this the only thing over here?

1035
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,520
Yes.

1036
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,720
How do I check the time?

1037
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,720
Natch Pinder's house.

1038
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:29,480
My man, you have a lot that you need to take care of before you fix this place up, okay?

1039
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,620
Oh, it's 6.37 a.m.

1040
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,380
Bruna, thank you so much for the read.

1041
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,560
Thank you for the redirect.

1042
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:45,940
Hello.

1043
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,480
Ray Mac, thank you for the gifted.

1044
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,440
Wait, so how do I know when it opens?

1045
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:50,700
Hmm.

1046
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,520
I didn't kill the employees.

1047
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,400
Oh, their little quaint graveyard.

1048
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:01,840
Oh, gosh.

1049
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,540
Everything's so...

1050
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,080
Run down.

1051
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:05,540
All right.

1052
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:08,060
Well, let's leave this cult town.

1053
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,200
We're gonna start our own cult instead.

1054
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,940
That's he.

1055
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:12,980
Thank you for the gifted.

1056
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,600
Hi, sweetie.

1057
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,480
Thank you for the gifted.

1058
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,600
Thank you, guys.

1059
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:17,600
All right.

1060
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,700
This...

1061
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,400
This way.

1062
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,080
Oh.

1063
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,100
Go, horse.

1064
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:21,320
Go.

1065
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,940
We'll go around.

1066
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,440
This way.

1067
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:31,690
Goodbye.

1068
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,130
Goodbye, cult town.

1069
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:34,550
Goodbye.

1070
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,670
I think this is a path.

1071
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,250
Nope, I lied.

1072
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:39,970
It's okay.

1073
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,550
We don't need a path.

1074
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,670
We make our own.

1075
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,210
We make our...

1076
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:44,910
Oh, that's a rat.

1077
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,570
Keep running.

1078
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,270
Take off.

1079
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:48,870
Thank you for the gifted.

1080
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,010
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

1081
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:54,910
Oh, I'm at a house.

1082
00:41:55,770 --> 00:41:57,370
Is this rat still following me?

1083
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:00,190
No.

1084
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,550
Stop the music, then.

1085
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,130
I'm scared.

1086
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,250
Oh, yes, he is.

1087
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,850
I see him.

1088
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:07,190
Leave me alone.

1089
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,370
Oh.

1090
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,830
Yeah.

1091
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,970
Take that.

1092
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:18,250
Rat scum.

1093
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,170
Whose house is this?

1094
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,130
Knock, knock.

1095
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,010
Weatherly.

1096
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,330
What was that?

1097
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,270
Oh.

1098
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,370
I heard something.

1099
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,870
That doesn't look too good in here.

1100
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,550
There's bones.

1101
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:48,610
Uh-oh.

1102
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,210
Oh, my God.

1103
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,470
Oh, my God.

1104
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:53,850
Uh.

1105
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,690
Uh, I don't think...

1106
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:56,930
Oh.

1107
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,900
Uh.

1108
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,820
I think the owner had a pretty rough time.

1109
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:06,720
Holy cow.

1110
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,640
This place is trashed.

1111
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:13,140
You guys hear that up there, right?

1112
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:14,340
That's scary.

1113
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Covered pot.

1114
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,200
Oh, my God.

1115
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,720
Stripped him to the bone.

1116
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,580
Let's see what's in here.

1117
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,400
I'm scared, though.

1118
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,160
I'm scared.

1119
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:30,920
What's in here?

1120
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,990
Ghosts, maybe?

1121
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,950
You heard the thumping, too, no?

1122
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:43,490
Nah.

1123
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,030
I'll take the repair hammer.

1124
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:49,610
I think that's pretty good, right?

1125
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,470
We could go minecrafting with a pickaxe.

1126
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:59,070
If there's anything ever that you guys see that might be pretty good, um...

1127
00:43:59,070 --> 00:43:59,890
Just let me know.

1128
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,850
Because I don't know what's...

1129
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,150
Worth it.

1130
00:44:04,830 --> 00:44:05,050
Oh.

1131
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:06,330
In this game.

1132
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:07,110
Oh, my God.

1133
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,550
Somebody's definitely here.

1134
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:11,690
Oh, I just...

1135
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:16,630
I can use the hammers.

1136
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,350
This one, I think it was...

1137
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:20,630
No, this one.

1138
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,710
No.

1139
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:22,590
Hammer?

1140
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,510
I didn't see a hammer.

1141
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,170
Skelly's everywhere.

1142
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,350
Oh, gosh.

1143
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:35,990
The music is so whimsical, but my heart is racing.

1144
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:36,610
Oh.

1145
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:38,190
Wait, there's just...

1146
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,370
A bunch of skulls.

1147
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:40,910
Is there anybody here?

1148
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,690
Oh.

1149
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,730
Whatever happened here was a bad, bad time.

1150
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:50,850
Oh, I already picked it up.

1151
00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:52,590
Oh, the repair hammer.

1152
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,430
Oh.

1153
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:54,830
I thought there was a different hammer.

1154
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,770
Okay, okay, okay.

1155
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,930
Yeah, because that'll repair my bow and stuff.

1156
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:02,350
Maybe...

1157
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,430
Maybe this isn't in for ghosts.

1158
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:06,710
Or skeletons, rather.

1159
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,050
Or...

1160
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:10,110
Okay.

1161
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:11,590
Well...

1162
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:12,990
Gosh.

1163
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,590
It sucks.

1164
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:15,550
For whoever...

1165
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,790
Whoever lived here...

1166
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:21,790
Oof.

1167
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:24,130
What time is it?

1168
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:24,830
You said tea?

1169
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,570
8.45.

1170
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,230
Well, we're wasting time.

1171
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:34,930
We gotta get to... the place!

1172
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,890
Oh wait, is this thing again?

1173
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,390
E.T.

1174
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,290
Bonhomme.

1175
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,790
This thing will grant us a... something.

1176
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,610
Continue your penance to earn the god's forgiveness.

1177
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,590
My penance?

1178
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:55,890
What am I doing?

1179
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,590
I'm not apologizing.

1180
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,650
I'm not apologizing for nothing.

1181
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:02,890
What was that?

1182
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:05,970
Hmm.

1183
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:07,650
Alright, let's go horse.

1184
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:10,710
I'm no criminal!

1185
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,410
Wait, so if I'm a criminal, I can't get god's blessing?

1186
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,300
Will they let me into the town?

1187
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,560
This way.

1188
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,460
Oh, another abandoned place.

1189
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,420
What is up with that?

1190
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,300
Aw, the deer are so cute!

1191
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,480
Oh, another fort!

1192
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,820
Oh, there's probably rats here.

1193
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,560
Let's leave.

1194
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,100
Rats and or... um... the bandits.

1195
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:57,820
Go horse, go!

1196
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,420
Some books can give you skill bonuses, so they're worth a read.

1197
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,620
Spell tomes can give you new spells.

1198
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,760
Alright, horse.

1199
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:08,380
Come on.

1200
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,420
Hup, hup!

1201
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:10,480
Hup, hup, hup!

1202
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:10,800
Horse!

1203
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,100
It's just a mountain!

1204
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:17,920
Oh my gosh, it's like we're in... um...

1205
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,220
It's like we're in the sound of music.

1206
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,540
Wow!

1207
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,000
Oh, up the hill once more!

1208
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,660
I'm not horsing around.

1209
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,680
We're getting straight to the place.

1210
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,100
Is that it?

1211
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,380
It looks a little frightening.

1212
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,060
How do I get down from here?

1213
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:40,660
Uh-oh.

1214
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:42,920
Um...

1215
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,080
Wait, what's that horse?

1216
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:45,660
Check it out.

1217
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,900
This deer is frozen.

1218
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,640
Oh, never mind.

1219
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,480
Wait, what do you mean save first?

1220
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,380
How do I save again?

1221
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,580
Quick save?

1222
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,020
I'm quick saving.

1223
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,800
Oh, F5.

1224
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,240
Thank you.

1225
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,780
A lead well.

1226
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,460
You draw power from the well.

1227
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,600
What am I?

1228
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,060
Uh...

1229
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,200
Did anything happen?

1230
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,340
I got a buff.

1231
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,340
Yeah.

1232
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:35,780
Something.

1233
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:36,640
Whatever that is.

1234
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,660
Uh...

1235
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:41,960
How can I see what it is?

1236
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:42,240
Magic?

1237
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,500
Clairvoyance?

1238
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:45,340
Is that what I just got?

1239
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,000
No.

1240
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,620
Magic tab shows buffs.

1241
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:57,870
Last tab.

1242
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:58,090
Last tab.

1243
00:48:58,090 --> 00:48:58,710
So what was this?

1244
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:00,830
Fortify agility.

1245
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,190
Fortify luck.

1246
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:02,890
Fortify magical.

1247
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:03,810
Fortify speed.

1248
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:04,750
Resist disease.

1249
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,710
Fancy!

1250
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,390
Come on, horse.

1251
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,360
Uh...

1252
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,060
Huh.

1253
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,360
I think I can...

1254
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,440
I don't know how much gold I have.

1255
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,280
To bribe anybody.

1256
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,060
But you know...

1257
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,540
Wow, we really are like a mountain goat.

1258
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,760
I think maybe any amount could be good.

1259
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,030
Look at that.

1260
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,290
We went on a little adventure.

1261
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:44,890
I never sold my stuff!

1262
00:49:45,530 --> 00:49:47,430
I was hoping I could sell it.

1263
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,750
At the place.

1264
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:51,050
I guess they wouldn't have given me good money, huh?

1265
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:51,810
Yeah, you're right.

1266
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,050
I never sold any of my things.

1267
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:54,770
I didn't know what to sell!

1268
00:49:56,770 --> 00:49:57,530
Wait, what was that?

1269
00:49:57,650 --> 00:49:58,670
Oh, my... my horse.

1270
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:00,670
Okay.

1271
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:03,510
But if I tell them that this is very official matter...

1272
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,650
Wait.

1273
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:07,430
Dagny's camp.

1274
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:09,810
Who are you?

1275
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:11,410
Are you friend?

1276
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:13,130
Oh.

1277
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,690
The deer are kissing.

1278
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,540
Are you friend, Dagny?

1279
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,640
You won't hurt my horse, will you?

1280
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,880
Oh.

1281
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:33,860
Hello?

1282
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,420
You're not friend.

1283
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,540
You are not friend.

1284
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,420
Wait, wait, wait!

1285
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,520
No, my horse!

1286
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:40,740
Don't go after my horse!

1287
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:42,160
Oh, my God!

1288
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:42,880
You're the worst!

1289
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:44,460
Hey!

1290
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,860
Stop touching my horse!

1291
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,140
Why did he go after my horse?

1292
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,180
First thing!

1293
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,580
You don't have any friends in here?

1294
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:56,620
Oh.

1295
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:00,260
What?

1296
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,100
What a scoundrel.

1297
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:06,160
We'll take all his stuff and sell it.

1298
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:14,610
What?

1299
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:14,990
What's that?

1300
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:19,330
Wait, what's in here?

1301
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:20,430
What's in your sack?

1302
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:21,630
Got some food?

1303
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,590
My poor horse is taking...

1304
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,170
So much damage!

1305
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,950
Everybody always attacks you first!

1306
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,870
Maybe you're the criminal!

1307
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:32,850
Not me!

1308
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:39,830
Yeah, now this is Minto's camp.

1309
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,830
Hear ye, hear ye.

1310
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,470
I've taken control.

1311
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,210
Alright.

1312
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,510
And it's not like he wanted to take my horse.

1313
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:56,370
Why would he try to kill it otherwise?

1314
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:00,450
He was like talking, so I thought he was gonna be a friendly guy.

1315
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:04,250
I guess never trust people that talk to themselves.

1316
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:06,290
Another fort?

1317
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,010
Are all the forts dungeons?

1318
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,640
Oh!

1319
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,900
I forgot to search his body!

1320
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:16,400
You're right!

1321
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:19,980
Yes!

1322
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,000
I see!

1323
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:21,820
I see!

1324
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,440
Thank you guys!

1325
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,680
I forgot to search...

1326
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:27,060
I forgot to take him...

1327
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:27,220
Wait.

1328
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,320
What's tall...

1329
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:29,920
Wink?

1330
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:32,980
Oh, it might be one of those.

1331
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,340
Okay.

1332
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:36,980
Where is his body?

1333
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:37,740
Down here.

1334
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,420
Look at the way he's laying.

1335
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,400
He's so stiff.

1336
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,560
He actually looks so peaceful.

1337
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:50,200
Aw, man.

1338
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,020
He's got nothing.

1339
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,700
Can you pick him up?

1340
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:00,880
I don't...

1341
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,200
I don't think you can pick up bodies, no?

1342
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:07,720
Boots, what the fu...

1343
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,000
Alright.

1344
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,540
Onwards to the castle.

1345
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,080
Or to the...

1346
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:13,580
City.

1347
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:15,580
Whatever that is.

1348
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,620
E to drag them!

1349
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:19,280
Oh.

1350
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,560
I wish I had seen that before...

1351
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,980
With the guy that I killed earlier.

1352
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,040
That wasn't a bandit.

1353
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,300
I don't think they'll even...

1354
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,420
What if we...

1355
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,720
What if E-Tina puts on a different wig?

1356
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:38,600
They'll never recognize her.

1357
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,340
Okay.

1358
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,280
We've explored this place now.

1359
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:45,880
Onwards.

1360
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:46,760
Wait, what is that?

1361
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,980
Oh, that doesn't look like a friend.

1362
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:51,320
Okay.

1363
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:51,920
Keep going.

1364
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,500
Put on some makeup.

1365
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,160
We can put on our...

1366
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:57,500
We have...

1367
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,320
We have put on our prettiest gown.

1368
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,460
Like, nobody should...

1369
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,340
Should be able to tell.

1370
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:02,900
Um...

1371
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,060
I think I gotta go this way.

1372
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,940
To get up there.

1373
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,020
There.

1374
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:14,910
We're getting there, guys.

1375
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:16,150
I saw a house, too.

1376
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,090
So maybe there's some people living in there.

1377
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:19,710
Or not.

1378
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,990
They could all be...

1379
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:23,890
Deceased.

1380
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,270
I wish I could shoot...

1381
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:26,410
On my horse.

1382
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,970
You know?

1383
00:54:28,630 --> 00:54:29,910
We'll avoid the...

1384
00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:30,910
The dingoes.

1385
00:54:33,090 --> 00:54:34,750
The Gold Coast!

1386
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,190
Sorry that it's kinda stuttering a little bit.

1387
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,900
But I haven't been lagging.

1388
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:43,500
Which is great.

1389
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:48,580
Shit comb farm!

1390
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,320
That's not very nice.

1391
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,540
To call your farm that.

1392
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,740
It's a very lovely farm.

1393
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,640
Actually...

1394
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,780
You have no animals.

1395
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,080
Why is it so...

1396
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,360
A little goblin.

1397
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:09,700
Wait.

1398
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,700
Get my bow now.

1399
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,820
I don't want this guy to get me.

1400
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,500
I think I can get him.

1401
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:21,100
Shoot.

1402
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:21,940
Oh shoot.

1403
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,020
Don't attack my horse.

1404
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:24,520
Thank you.

1405
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,200
See guys!

1406
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,540
Why is it so...

1407
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:34,960
Oh wait.

1408
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:35,480
Where'd he go?

1409
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,240
Where's his body?

1410
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,980
I lost him.

1411
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:41,700
I lost him.

1412
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:44,360
I was looking at a pile of rocks the whole time.

1413
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,040
Wait.

1414
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,040
Where is he?

1415
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,360
Oh there he is.

1416
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,880
Little imp.

1417
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,460
Eyes like a ghost.

1418
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,280
I'll put my thing away.

1419
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,500
Let's go inside.

1420
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,600
Maybe there's somebody in there.

1421
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,340
Oh look.

1422
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:04,960
This is nice.

1423
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:05,820
This is so...

1424
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,240
This is so lovely.

1425
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,360
Somebody's gotta be in here.

1426
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,260
Oh.

1427
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,420
I've entered what appears to be a recently abandoned farmhouse.

1428
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,620
Perhaps if I search around I may find a clue as to the owner's whereabouts.

1429
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,080
Continue.

1430
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:23,680
Okay.

1431
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,640
We got a new quest.

1432
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,020
How exciting.

1433
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,540
The owner's whereabouts eh?

1434
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,820
Uh huh.

1435
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,440
The owner's whereabouts.

1436
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,220
Anything in the fireplace?

1437
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,880
I don't see anything.

1438
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,300
What are these?

1439
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,120
Root pulp.

1440
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,940
Columbine root pulp.

1441
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,200
Leak.

1442
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,200
What about in your drawers?

1443
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:55,980
Blue and green outfit.

1444
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:56,760
That's like me.

1445
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:57,440
Hold on.

1446
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:58,300
We got a...

1447
00:56:58,300 --> 00:56:59,640
Burgundy linens.

1448
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:02,340
Nobody's here so...

1449
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:06,820
Wait.

1450
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:07,480
Inventory.

1451
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:07,920
Here we go.

1452
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,380
Let's put on a new outfit.

1453
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,560
Suddenly this becomes a...

1454
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,800
Like a dress simulator.

1455
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,840
E...

1456
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:24,920
Tina.

1457
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,680
It's just me.

1458
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:30,760
It's just me.

1459
00:57:33,740 --> 00:57:35,760
Are you kidding me right now?

1460
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,360
Wait.

1461
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,320
We got the linens.

1462
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:38,900
Oh, sorry.

1463
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,840
To match the shirt.

1464
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,000
Tina is styling right now.

1465
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,620
Which one do you guys like better?

1466
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:52,800
This one.

1467
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,380
Or this one.

1468
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,840
Her name is E-Tina?

1469
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,040
Yeah.

1470
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:05,300
Green?

1471
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,940
Okay, we'll go with the green outfit.

1472
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,380
I'll put the other one back.

1473
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,700
Can I do that?

1474
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,200
I wish I could.

1475
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,900
I'll drop it on the floor.

1476
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:17,220
Wait.

1477
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:17,740
No!

1478
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,820
We can save it.

1479
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:18,860
What?

1480
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:20,520
Oh, whose breeches are these?

1481
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,920
It's not mine.

1482
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:25,780
Hit F.

1483
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,140
Oh.

1484
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,420
I see.

1485
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,300
I kind of want to keep them though.

1486
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:36,700
Oh.

1487
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,120
It said to search the...

1488
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,400
The place to find where...

1489
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:41,600
Wait.

1490
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,380
Maybe in the barrel?

1491
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:42,800
I don't know.

1492
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:45,740
Some gold?

1493
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,820
I need that for sure.

1494
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:53,380
It said to search to find where the owners have gone, but...

1495
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,100
Am I dumb?

1496
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,240
Hmm.

1497
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,640
There's a note somewhere.

1498
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,760
That's a...

1499
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,160
That's a knife and a fork.

1500
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:19,410
Do I need to like, move some stuff?

1501
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:21,990
What did the quest say?

1502
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:26,030
Uh...

1503
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,930
If I search around, I may find a clue.

1504
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,450
Well, maybe it's just a search around, so...

1505
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:35,490
I assumed it was inside.

1506
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,710
Could be outside too.

1507
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,310
Let's go check.

1508
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:41,830
Hold E to move things.

1509
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,110
Yeah, I was trying...

1510
00:59:43,110 --> 00:59:44,570
I was doing that, but it wasn't working.

1511
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:48,030
Oh.

1512
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,550
Oh, it's not foggy anymore.

1513
00:59:49,730 --> 00:59:49,990
Nice.

1514
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:55,570
E.

1515
00:59:56,990 --> 00:59:57,450
E.

1516
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:01,430
Fold the claw.

1517
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,490
Some more gold?

1518
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:04,710
Take that.

1519
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,890
Someone said try X.

1520
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:10,150
Oh.

1521
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:11,290
I could try that instead.

1522
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:11,990
Wait.

1523
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,550
If I do it on like...

1524
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:15,710
Is it anything?

1525
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:16,010
No.

1526
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:18,530
Let me try...

1527
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:22,170
A pewter picture.

1528
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:30,790
But it looks like the crops are being maintained.

1529
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:31,170
No?

1530
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:34,910
They couldn't have...

1531
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,470
They couldn't have left so long ago.

1532
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,150
Hold E.

1533
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:47,430
Hold on.

1534
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:47,990
Let me go...

1535
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:49,450
Let me go try with one of the plates.

1536
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,380
Has to be interactable.

1537
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:54,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1538
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:55,800
Let's see.

1539
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:56,400
All right.

1540
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:57,600
I'm on this plate.

1541
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,720
I hold E.

1542
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,840
Oh!

1543
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,360
Oh!

1544
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,040
I don't know why...

1545
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:06,660
Oh!

1546
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,160
Oh!

1547
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:07,840
Oh!

1548
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,620
I don't know my own strength.

1549
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:10,200
Oh, sorry!

1550
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:14,890
I don't know my own strength.

1551
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:15,490
I'm so sorry.

1552
01:01:16,050 --> 01:01:16,610
I'm sorry.

1553
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,590
Where is she?

1554
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:20,350
Where is she?

1555
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:25,230
I think I was trying on the chair and that's why it didn't work.

1556
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:29,910
Hmm...

1557
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,450
I don't think it's in here.

1558
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:32,570
Unless...

1559
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:32,990
No.

1560
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:37,350
I don't think the info is in here.

1561
01:01:41,250 --> 01:01:42,010
It went...

1562
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:42,130
Wait.

1563
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,170
Something fell on the floor?

1564
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,390
Oh, did it...

1565
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:45,670
Wait, did it really?

1566
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:47,810
Everything flew.

1567
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:48,830
I couldn't tell.

1568
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:51,790
Oh!

1569
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:52,390
This?

1570
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:54,870
Slythe's journal.

1571
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:56,910
Oh!

1572
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:03,750
I've come across a discarded page of a journal of a Slythe Seringi in an abandoned farmhouse near the ruins of Kvatch.

1573
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:04,410
Ruins!

1574
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:11,050
It mentions some sort of pilgrimage to bring an offering of great value to something called the Sunken One.

1575
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,610
All signs point to a sandstone cavern nearby.

1576
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:18,610
I should proceed there, as I fear for Slythe's safety.

1577
01:02:18,610 --> 01:02:19,770
I don't even know this guy.

1578
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,210
Wait, what is spoilers?

1579
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:25,250
As midnight...

1580
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:26,250
Oh, the...

1581
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,290
The quest?

1582
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:31,230
As midnight approaches, I still watch the fires burn.

1583
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:38,610
The great city of man, Kvatch, lay in ruins.

1584
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,630
They didn't heed my words.

1585
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:43,530
They didn't listen to my voice.

1586
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:46,250
Now they are all paying the cost of ignorance.

1587
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:49,250
The Sunken One strikes swift and hard.

1588
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:53,990
He swats those who oppose him as if they do not exist at all.

1589
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,810
The excuses of man fall upon deaf ears.

1590
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,090
The Sunken One has no pity.

1591
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:02,930
He has no mercy.

1592
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:05,830
He only sits below and passes sentence.

1593
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:11,370
And now, with a mighty stroke, he's toppled one of man's pitiful blights on his land.

1594
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,090
And yet he still hungers.

1595
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:19,850
His appetite is voracious.

1596
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,350
Kvatch will not be the last city to fall by his hand.

1597
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:27,390
The world of man grows more and more corrupt and it angers him.

1598
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,130
Man's lies and deceit will be his undoing.

1599
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:40,530
As the Sunken One grows impatient and no longer waits for or accepts the proper offering.

1600
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:44,450
The burden is mine to shoulder.

1601
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:48,590
I am the last who knows of he who shakes the ground.

1602
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:53,630
If I do not bring him the offering, who knows what city may fall prey to his whim.

1603
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:54,710
Anvil?

1604
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:57,110
Coral?

1605
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:01,410
Or perhaps he will turn his eyes on the greatest boil of all.

1606
01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:03,510
The great imperial city itself.

1607
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:05,610
No, I must not let that happen.

1608
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:08,810
I must get the offering to him like my father did before me.

1609
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:12,350
Man may be fallen in his eyes.

1610
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:16,070
But they must have time to learn the Sunken One's teachings.

1611
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,050
Destroying man now would be a waste.

1612
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:22,690
When I am certain that given the chance, they will come to see his ways.

1613
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:26,630
Don't say yawn, it makes me yawn.

1614
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,940
You violated the law by being the eepiest ghost.

1615
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,680
I am so eepy all this way.

1616
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,400
All this reading...

1617
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,080
This note's a snore fest.

1618
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,040
Yes, I will do this thing.

1619
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:49,080
I will brave the depths of Sandstone Cavern to see him.

1620
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,600
My weapons will be my will and my word.

1621
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:54,500
The Sunken One will watch over me and guide me.

1622
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,700
I must depart soon before it's too late.

1623
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:04,520
If anyone finds this page, let them know that I, Slythe Syringi, do this for the good of all men.

1624
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,200
Okay.

1625
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:09,520
Syringi.

1626
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,400
I don't know, that sounds like a pretty tough mission.

1627
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:20,020
I'm only level 2.

1628
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,720
I don't think I can, you know...

1629
01:05:23,340 --> 01:05:27,740
I don't think I can take down a dark lord anytime soon.

1630
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:30,960
Thanks, Syringi.

1631
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,700
I believe in him.

1632
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,220
It's easy!

1633
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,060
Oh, there's a road here.

1634
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,240
Wait, so it's the fallen city?

1635
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,620
So like...

1636
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,060
Is there anybody here?

1637
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,780
Level scaling.

1638
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,040
Wait, who's after me?

1639
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:52,780
Ouch!

1640
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,000
Oh my god, my dog!

1641
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,120
I mean, my horse!

1642
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:57,740
Hey!

1643
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:58,700
Hey, wolf!

1644
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,180
Take that.

1645
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:03,940
You okay, horse?

1646
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,160
My horse is so tough.

1647
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,100
Everybody attacks you, horse.

1648
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:09,400
Oh, whoops.

1649
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,060
What did I just do?

1650
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:10,640
Nope, nothing.

1651
01:06:11,420 --> 01:06:13,160
My horse looks a little blind.

1652
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,340
You got something in your eye, buddy?

1653
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:16,800
You okay?

1654
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:18,180
Okay.

1655
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,980
So then maybe I should do that quest.

1656
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,940
What the...

1657
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,120
What does...

1658
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:26,440
I pressed Q.

1659
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,300
What does that do?

1660
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,620
Is it auto walk?

1661
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,760
Whoa!

1662
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,180
Sandstone...

1663
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,200
Sandstone caverns.

1664
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,070
Whew.

1665
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,330
Where would that be?

1666
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,250
184?

1667
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:51,590
Steps away?

1668
01:06:52,410 --> 01:06:54,150
Is it not just that guy's house?

1669
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:56,830
I don't know where sandstone caverns are.

1670
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,040
Every mission and enemy is scaled to your level, but so are rewards and loot.

1671
01:07:05,220 --> 01:07:06,460
For better or worse.

1672
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,400
So sometimes you might want to wait to do things.

1673
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:16,940
Ah...

1674
01:07:16,940 --> 01:07:18,120
To your next welcome to membership.

1675
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:18,640
Thank you!

1676
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,320
Okay, then we'll go to the...

1677
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,100
We'll go to the...

1678
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:21,560
This place.

1679
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:28,840
We'll...

1680
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,040
We'll ignore it for now.

1681
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:34,610
Cause I...

1682
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,790
Don't want to exactly...

1683
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:37,550
Wait.

1684
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,510
I see a guy there.

1685
01:07:39,230 --> 01:07:40,770
He's definitely not a friend.

1686
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:44,710
Wait.

1687
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,690
I saw him over here.

1688
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:47,950
Mortal camp!

1689
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,310
Die, mortal!

1690
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:51,610
Wait.

1691
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:52,610
Did I see a guy there?

1692
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:56,030
Maybe I completely hallucinated.

1693
01:07:56,390 --> 01:07:57,690
And imagined him.

1694
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,050
I thought I saw a bald man's head.

1695
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:02,010
Wait.

1696
01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:04,730
I could have sworn I saw a bald man's head.

1697
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,850
Why are there just random camps set up?

1698
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:12,500
If I...

1699
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,340
If I turn this...

1700
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:14,880
I knew it!

1701
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:16,340
Ah!

1702
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:18,860
You're not bald at all, actually!

1703
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:20,080
You have a full head of hair!

1704
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:24,600
Lockpicks!

1705
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,360
Weak, poisonous, feeble mind.

1706
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:28,920
I was right, though!

1707
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:31,480
I was right.

1708
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,240
There was a man.

1709
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,760
Just not...

1710
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:35,320
Bald.

1711
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:39,080
He heard me call him bald.

1712
01:08:39,280 --> 01:08:40,740
Yeah, he put his little toupee on.

1713
01:08:41,720 --> 01:08:42,620
He said bald?

1714
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,600
I'll show you bald!

1715
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:47,720
They got anything else here?

1716
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,340
Nothing?

1717
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,320
What a lame...

1718
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,000
What?

1719
01:08:55,180 --> 01:08:55,600
You're...

1720
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:58,380
You're the worst at your job.

1721
01:08:58,420 --> 01:08:59,480
I thought you were a bandit.

1722
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:00,780
You've stolen nothing.

1723
01:09:00,780 --> 01:09:00,900
What happened?

1724
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:08,700
Wait, so I can pick him up?

1725
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:11,560
Wait, he's heavy.

1726
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:12,220
Come here.

1727
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:13,260
Wait, come here.

1728
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:16,440
Come here.

1729
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,800
Come here.

1730
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,300
Whoa, don't...

1731
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,160
Throw your legs open like that.

1732
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:25,960
Come here.

1733
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:28,960
He's too heavy!

1734
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:32,180
There we go, there we go.

1735
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:33,680
There we go, there we go.

1736
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,200
There we go.

1737
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,640
I don't even know where I would take him.

1738
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,030
I kinda wanna throw him over the ledge, but...

1739
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:46,770
It's a little bit of tough work.

1740
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:49,190
My arms are too scrawny.

1741
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,970
Get your arrows back!

1742
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:53,930
I have so many arrows, trust.

1743
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,490
I have...

1744
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,290
I have so many arrows.

1745
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,880
You guys see that guy up there?

1746
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,620
Will I be okay?

1747
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:17,980
I have the final DMC...

1748
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,960
DMC5 boss sleep stuck in my head since he played.

1749
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,200
It's a guard, yeah.

1750
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,360
Hello?

1751
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,300
Act natural.

1752
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:28,980
Act natural!

1753
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,280
Uh oh.

1754
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:33,220
Oh.

1755
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,920
Everything's fine.

1756
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:37,400
Hello!

1757
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,160
Stop!

1758
01:10:39,660 --> 01:10:39,740
Oh!

1759
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,080
You violated the law.

1760
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,480
You have to lack the funds to pay the cost.

1761
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,260
You must serve out your sentence.

1762
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,620
Your stolen goods are now forfeit.

1763
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:49,340
Okay, you can take the horse back.

1764
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,420
You can take the horse...

1765
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:52,840
Why, bounty is 12...

1766
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:53,600
1200!

1767
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,220
Go to jail?

1768
01:10:58,720 --> 01:10:58,740
Go to jail?

1769
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,320
I can't...

1770
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,100
It won't even let me resist arrest.

1771
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,980
Hope you rot, criminal scum.

1772
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:08,860
Scum.

1773
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:10,860
Wait!

1774
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:13,620
No!

1775
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:14,320
My outfit!

1776
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,820
You will get them back when you are released.

1777
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:20,600
Um...

1778
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,080
What do I do until then?

1779
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:28,440
Go to sleep to serve your sentence.

1780
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:29,160
Oh, okay.

1781
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,960
I'm serving my time.

1782
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:32,480
No!

1783
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:32,980
Wait!

1784
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:33,720
It...

1785
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:35,200
It all happened so fast!

1786
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,640
Something's decreased!

1787
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:40,040
Oh.

1788
01:11:40,240 --> 01:11:40,940
Oh, here it is.

1789
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,610
I thought you said I would get my stuff back.

1790
01:11:50,570 --> 01:11:51,530
Oh, here we go.

1791
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,530
They couldn't even let me dress myself.

1792
01:11:55,190 --> 01:11:56,270
Where's my horse?

1793
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,080
Do I have shoes?

1794
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:02,960
Yeah.

1795
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,100
Where am I?

1796
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,740
Hello.

1797
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:09,240
Hi.

1798
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,280
Is my horse...

1799
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,180
Is my...

1800
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:14,960
Where am I?

1801
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:16,260
Wait, where am I?

1802
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,160
Skingrad!

1803
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,040
Where the hell am I?

1804
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,060
No, sorry.

1805
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:21,960
I'm here.

1806
01:12:22,340 --> 01:12:22,820
Wait.

1807
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:23,980
No, I'm not.

1808
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:24,720
I'm...

1809
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:24,980
Wait.

1810
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:26,240
I'm over here!

1811
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,660
What the hell?

1812
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:36,490
Oh, no.

1813
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:37,290
What?

1814
01:12:37,630 --> 01:12:38,810
Where am I?

1815
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:40,770
Castle Skingrad.

1816
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:47,650
Oh, my God.

1817
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:51,410
Kabach didn't have a jail.

1818
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:54,690
Oh, well, we can check out this place while we're here.

1819
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:55,410
What is it?

1820
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:55,870
Hello.

1821
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:56,710
What can I do for you?

1822
01:12:58,150 --> 01:12:58,590
Um...

1823
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:59,170
Rumors.

1824
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:02,890
Battlehorn Castle, near Coral, is besieged by Marauders.

1825
01:13:03,070 --> 01:13:04,670
I wish I could go and save them.

1826
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,270
Nah, it sounds tough.

1827
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:07,990
Yeah, bye.

1828
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:08,350
You too.

1829
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:13,180
Oh, no.

1830
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,880
She said bye, but I thought she was saying, have a nice day, and I said, you too!

1831
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,600
That guy's probably so embarrassed right now.

1832
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:22,640
Maybe now would be a good time to sell some stuff.

1833
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:23,600
Yeah, true!

1834
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,430
Where am I, anyway?

1835
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:32,390
Uh...

1836
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:33,010
Barracks?

1837
01:13:33,950 --> 01:13:35,670
I'm just a little alone.

1838
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:36,670
E.T.

1839
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:38,790
Extra...

1840
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,370
Hello.

1841
01:13:42,030 --> 01:13:43,130
Down he is.

1842
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:43,850
Oh, okay.

1843
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:48,490
Oh!

1844
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,150
It was only blacked out!

1845
01:13:50,330 --> 01:13:51,830
Not that I couldn't select it.

1846
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,810
It's that I've already asked about it.

1847
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:54,530
Farewell.

1848
01:13:54,670 --> 01:13:55,450
Oh, I could've...

1849
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:56,530
I could've killed that guy.

1850
01:13:57,070 --> 01:13:57,450
Dang it.

1851
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,230
Don't you recognize me?

1852
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:04,410
I was just in your jail.

1853
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,090
I guess he doesn't care anymore.

1854
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:09,770
Oh!

1855
01:14:10,490 --> 01:14:11,110
My bad.

1856
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:12,510
Wrong door.

1857
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:21,430
What's over here?

1858
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:22,450
County Hall.

1859
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,510
This place is so nice looking.

1860
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:27,790
County Hall.

1861
01:14:27,870 --> 01:14:29,790
Oh, I can enter that County Hall.

1862
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,830
Anything in your crates?

1863
01:14:33,050 --> 01:14:33,170
Oh.

1864
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,390
The crates are not open to the people.

1865
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:38,290
This is such a cute little castle.

1866
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:38,770
Oh.

1867
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,150
Not open to the people.

1868
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:43,970
They're doing their...

1869
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,310
They're doing their rounds.

1870
01:14:48,170 --> 01:14:49,030
It's you.

1871
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:49,770
Hi.

1872
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:50,490
Hi.

1873
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:51,190
Hello there.

1874
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,560
Yeah?

1875
01:14:58,040 --> 01:14:58,940
Excuse me.

1876
01:14:59,080 --> 01:14:59,860
I'm on duty.

1877
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:00,940
I can tell.

1878
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:08,120
If you're looking to learn a bit about conjuration, Silenus Vecinus is a good person to talk to.

1879
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,000
Who?

1880
01:15:10,240 --> 01:15:13,480
If you're looking to learn a bit about conjuration...

1881
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,220
Silenus Vecinus.

1882
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:17,280
Silenus Vecinus is a good person.

1883
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:17,600
Silenus Vecinus.

1884
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:18,780
What about you?

1885
01:15:18,820 --> 01:15:19,720
We're always on duty.

1886
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,320
Oh, you need to sleep eventually.

1887
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,260
One Guard tells the truth.

1888
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:25,820
One Guard only tells...

1889
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:26,520
Only lies.

1890
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:29,820
I learned quite a bit about how to use a shield from Ambrose Can.

1891
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,160
It cost me a bit, but it was worth it.

1892
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:40,280
I don't have enough money even for my own bail, so... the Lord's Manor.

1893
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:43,240
They're still at it.

1894
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,100
Okay, let's check out the hall.

1895
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:50,860
Oh, hello.

1896
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,020
They're so friendly here.

1897
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:56,960
Especially because I'm an ex-convict.

1898
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,640
What's so bad about going to jail?

1899
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,160
Because all I did was sleep.

1900
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,080
Honestly, it sounds kind of...

1901
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,820
Oh, you're talking to him.

1902
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:18,080
Oh, the stats, okay.

1903
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:27,200
Hellhorn Castle near Coral is besieged by marauders.

1904
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,580
I wish I could go and save them.

1905
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,080
Everybody says the same thing.

1906
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,000
I hear.

1907
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:33,940
Bye.

1908
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,260
Evening.

1909
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,060
Evening.

1910
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:36,580
Sorry.

1911
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:37,740
You want me?

1912
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,380
I'm Shum Gro Yarok, the Count's butler.

1913
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:41,800
Oh.

1914
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,380
Buy a house?

1915
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:49,480
I ask myself, do I like you enough to tell you about this?

1916
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:49,760
What?

1917
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,720
I am a perfectly paying citizen.

1918
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:56,020
If it's not one thing, it's another.

1919
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:56,960
What do you mean?

1920
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,140
The Count is very particular.

1921
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:58,920
You don't want money?

1922
01:16:59,100 --> 01:16:59,420
You don't want money?

1923
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:02,520
Everything must be just so.

1924
01:17:02,780 --> 01:17:04,760
Okay, let's persuade him.

1925
01:17:05,180 --> 01:17:05,460
So?

1926
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:08,800
Okay, it's at 25.

1927
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:11,080
Okay.

1928
01:17:12,160 --> 01:17:14,220
I have to figure out how to do this.

1929
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,220
He likes to be admired.

1930
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:20,780
He likes...

1931
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:22,120
He really likes to be admired.

1932
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,200
Um...

1933
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:24,880
He does not...

1934
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,060
But this one, it does not have so much, so...

1935
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,560
You're a big, fat liar.

1936
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,040
Oh, no.

1937
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,500
I, um...

1938
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:36,480
That's pretty good.

1939
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:37,200
Okay, here we go.

1940
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:38,420
Really now?

1941
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,000
You're such a charmer.

1942
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,020
You can't scare me.

1943
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:46,080
I think we got exactly back to where we were before.

1944
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,100
We went in a big old circle.

1945
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:57,700
Okay.

1946
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:03,040
Yeah, you like me now, or...?

1947
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,560
I ask myself...

1948
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,720
Do I like...

1949
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:06,820
Can I try again?

1950
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,280
I can.

1951
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:08,340
Make it quick.

1952
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:09,920
Oh!

1953
01:18:10,180 --> 01:18:10,900
Look at that.

1954
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:11,380
Look at that.

1955
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:13,760
Don't make me laugh.

1956
01:18:15,620 --> 01:18:16,140
Uh...

1957
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:17,440
You can't scare me.

1958
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:20,500
Um...

1959
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,620
No, you do me too much honor.

1960
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:23,360
Good one.

1961
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,040
Ooh!

1962
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,520
When we are better friends, ask again.

1963
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:30,240
Oh, my gosh.

1964
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:30,520
Okay.

1965
01:18:30,740 --> 01:18:31,900
We're gonna be besties.

1966
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:32,940
Say what you're going to say.

1967
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:34,580
Besties, besties, besties.

1968
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,380
Oh, my goodness.

1969
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,340
Uh...

1970
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:37,200
Joke is the...

1971
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:37,720
Yeah, I get it.

1972
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:38,240
Nice!

1973
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:39,840
Please, I'm embarrassed.

1974
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:41,020
But thank you.

1975
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:42,940
That's just talk.

1976
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:44,820
You're full of it.

1977
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:46,040
You're full of it.

1978
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:46,460
Oh!

1979
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,520
We're getting it.

1980
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:47,960
We're getting it.

1981
01:18:48,060 --> 01:18:48,340
We're getting it.

1982
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:48,780
I see.

1983
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,060
Do you like me now?

1984
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,860
I don't trust you enough.

1985
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:53,580
Oh, my God.

1986
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:56,040
All right.

1987
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:56,520
We're getting it.

1988
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:57,080
We're getting it.

1989
01:18:59,220 --> 01:18:59,580
Joke.

1990
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:00,660
Yeah, I get it.

1991
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:01,440
We're a jokester.

1992
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:01,920
Oh, no.

1993
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,380
Oh, no.

1994
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:05,520
Oh, that's just talk.

1995
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,120
Admire.

1996
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,540
What a wonderful compliment.

1997
01:19:07,820 --> 01:19:09,240
Don't make me laugh.

1998
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:11,320
Oh, I think we got back the same.

1999
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:12,500
It has to be like 70 plus.

2000
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:12,760
Okay.

2001
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:13,760
Really now?

2002
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,400
Yeah, I get it.

2003
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:17,920
Oh, gosh.

2004
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:19,460
Uh-oh.

2005
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:20,420
I'm in trouble.

2006
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:23,720
That's just talk.

2007
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:24,820
Oh, we're in trouble.

2008
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,020
You're full of it.

2009
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:26,380
No!

2010
01:19:29,180 --> 01:19:30,000
Really now?

2011
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:31,580
You're such a jammer.

2012
01:19:31,660 --> 01:19:32,140
Yeah, I know.

2013
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,040
You're a big, fat liar.

2014
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,160
Oh, gosh.

2015
01:19:36,300 --> 01:19:37,140
This is... Ugh.

2016
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:37,900
Ugh.

2017
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,380
You can't scare... That's pretty good.

2018
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:41,980
I'm fumbling.

2019
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,080
I'm fumbling.

2020
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:43,700
I'm fumbling.

2021
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,880
Maybe the hard one... Wasting your breath.

2022
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:47,760
Like that first?

2023
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,480
Blah, blah, blah.

2024
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,340
What a bore.

2025
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:51,280
Sure.

2026
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,360
No, you do me too much.

2027
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:56,360
I hate this video game.

2028
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,700
I'm breezless.

2029
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,860
I'm breezless.

2030
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,020
Yeah, I get it.

2031
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:01,440
Please.

2032
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:02,120
I'm embarrassed.

2033
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:02,640
No!

2034
01:20:03,180 --> 01:20:03,620
Oh, wait.

2035
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:03,900
Here we go.

2036
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:04,060
But thank you.

2037
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,920
You can't scare me.

2038
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,460
Don't make me laugh.

2039
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,400
I keep going in circles.

2040
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,300
I keep going in circles.

2041
01:20:12,740 --> 01:20:14,100
No, you do me too.

2042
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:16,020
You're a big, fat liar.

2043
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,260
Not bad.

2044
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:18,880
Not... Is that so?

2045
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:20,180
Okay, okay.

2046
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:23,320
When I first met you, I wasn't sure about you.

2047
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,200
Now that we've talked a bit, I'm not sure about you.

2048
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:27,740
Ugh.

2049
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:29,620
We got way up from 25, though.

2050
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:30,160
So true.

2051
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:30,740
So true.

2052
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:35,040
Don't make me laugh.

2053
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,280
Good one.

2054
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,260
Good one.

2055
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:38,480
Oh.

2056
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,080
Please, I'm embarrassed.

2057
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,240
Let's just talk.

2058
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:42,780
Okay, we got up just a little bit.

2059
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:43,660
Only five more.

2060
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,600
Look, he's... He's cheesing right now.

2061
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,760
I think he likes me.

2062
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:49,720
Let's try.

2063
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,000
Let's try.

2064
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,460
Look, I like you.

2065
01:20:52,860 --> 01:20:53,340
Wait.

2066
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,080
You like me?

2067
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,000
Look, I like you.

2068
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:55,600
You like me?

2069
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,120
You like me?

2070
01:20:57,380 --> 01:20:57,740
You like me?

2071
01:20:57,740 --> 01:20:58,800
Look, I like you.

2072
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,280
Yeah, you like me?

2073
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,360
All right.

2074
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:06,100
He likes us.

2075
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:06,360
Wait.

2076
01:21:06,980 --> 01:21:07,360
Start.

2077
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,300
You have reached the maximum disposition for this character.

2078
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:12,680
No!

2079
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,500
I don't... It's 12 gold.

2080
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:24,460
Every little bit helps.

2081
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:29,590
See?

2082
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:30,970
Was that hard?

2083
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:32,350
Yes.

2084
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:33,350
My bunny.

2085
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:37,170
Count Hasseldor will only consider buyers of distinction.

2086
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,490
You just aren't famous enough.

2087
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,950
You had to know me to tell me that?

2088
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:47,690
You had to be my bestie to get that information out of you?

2089
01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:51,170
Bye.

2090
01:21:51,170 --> 01:21:54,230
I'm never talking to you again, shum.

2091
01:21:54,530 --> 01:21:56,170
More like, sh-cum.

2092
01:21:57,930 --> 01:21:59,350
Oh, hello.

2093
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:01,230
What's going on with you?

2094
01:22:01,690 --> 01:22:05,970
I've heard people saying they ran into goblins around here not long ago.

2095
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:08,010
I can't stand those things.

2096
01:22:08,530 --> 01:22:11,050
I avoid those things whenever I can.

2097
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:12,070
What is...

2098
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,290
What is that?

2099
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:14,470
So long.

2100
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:15,230
Bye.

2101
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,710
What is this symbol?

2102
01:22:16,710 --> 01:22:18,410
Oh, hello.

2103
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:20,630
I'm Hal Leers.

2104
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:22,490
Count Skingrad's steward.

2105
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:26,450
The count does not accept unsolicited visitors, I'm afraid.

2106
01:22:26,830 --> 01:22:29,190
I apologize for the inconvenience.

2107
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:30,830
Austin Adia.

2108
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:31,790
Thank you so much for the vibe.

2109
01:22:31,870 --> 01:22:32,410
Good to thank you.

2110
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:35,110
Recently finished MGS3 for 3DS for the first time.

2111
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,330
My first Metal Gear game.

2112
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:40,030
Oh, the catch is I knew all the spoilers prior.

2113
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:41,970
But it was still fun.

2114
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:46,750
This got me thinking, which games have you experienced entirely through YouTube?

2115
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:52,270
Oh, there's probably a handful that I've done only through YouTube.

2116
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:56,190
I can't...

2117
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:57,510
Save...

2118
01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,330
I can't say...

2119
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:01,650
Oh, yeah.

2120
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:02,230
Rebirth.

2121
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:03,550
Yeah, Final Fantasy Rebirth.

2122
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:04,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2123
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:05,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2124
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:09,030
I did watch that through YouTube.

2125
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:12,190
Because I watch...

2126
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:14,170
Mainly when I watch like...

2127
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:15,930
Let's Players and stuff.

2128
01:23:16,010 --> 01:23:17,170
It'll be like...

2129
01:23:18,030 --> 01:23:19,170
It'll be like...

2130
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,850
Obscure indie horror game.

2131
01:23:24,090 --> 01:23:25,270
Kind of, you know, stuff like that.

2132
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:30,510
You're talking to me and I don't like you.

2133
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:31,390
Goodbye.

2134
01:23:31,690 --> 01:23:32,070
No!

2135
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:35,570
This better be good.

2136
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:36,590
We can persuade her.

2137
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:37,810
Damn, she's expensive.

2138
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:38,270
Okay.

2139
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:41,190
Um...

2140
01:23:42,370 --> 01:23:44,390
She likes to be coerced.

2141
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:46,570
Wait.

2142
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:50,050
She really likes to be coerced.

2143
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:51,070
She likes a boast.

2144
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,150
She...

2145
01:23:54,150 --> 01:23:55,790
She...

2146
01:23:55,790 --> 01:23:56,030
She...

2147
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:56,930
She...

2148
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:58,630
Doesn't like...

2149
01:23:58,630 --> 01:23:59,770
To be admired.

2150
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:03,090
Well done.

2151
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:04,470
Well done.

2152
01:24:06,510 --> 01:24:07,730
So I was like...

2153
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:09,190
You think that's funny?

2154
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:11,210
Yeah.

2155
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,650
Don't talk such...

2156
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:13,590
Yes, yes.

2157
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,030
Whatever you say.

2158
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:16,250
Okay.

2159
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:17,950
It's color-coded.

2160
01:24:18,110 --> 01:24:18,970
Not until...

2161
01:24:19,470 --> 01:24:20,470
I get it...

2162
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:21,450
Correct, though.

2163
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:23,390
I accept.

2164
01:24:23,650 --> 01:24:24,850
I have no choice.

2165
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:26,650
You think that's...

2166
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:26,890
Funny?

2167
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:30,330
I wish I could say that.

2168
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,410
Don't waste your flattery on me.

2169
01:24:32,750 --> 01:24:34,490
Don't waste your flattery on me.

2170
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:34,970
Okay, okay.

2171
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:36,450
Oh.

2172
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:37,170
Wait.

2173
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:38,190
Green...

2174
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:38,650
Wait, which one?

2175
01:24:38,710 --> 01:24:39,990
This one is the better one, right?

2176
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:40,650
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2177
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:40,950
Okay.

2178
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:42,390
So...

2179
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,290
Don't waste your flattery on me.

2180
01:24:44,870 --> 01:24:46,490
You think that's funny?

2181
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:47,630
Well done.

2182
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:48,550
Oh, this is like...

2183
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:49,190
Don't please, I'm sorry.

2184
01:24:49,190 --> 01:24:50,590
That was like a perfect run.

2185
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:51,250
Wow.

2186
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:53,430
That was like as good as it could go, I think.

2187
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:54,250
Wow.

2188
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,910
Oh my gosh.

2189
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:57,570
Nice.

2190
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,910
Um...

2191
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:06,740
I wish I could say that.

2192
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:07,560
Yes, yes.

2193
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:07,940
What?

2194
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:08,540
Not now.

2195
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,300
Not later.

2196
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:10,860
That's just stupid.

2197
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:13,660
We're rising her up.

2198
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,640
We're rising her up.

2199
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,680
E-Tina is killing it right now.

2200
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:18,280
Yes, yes.

2201
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,600
Whatever you say.

2202
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,160
Um...

2203
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:26,260
Let's boast.

2204
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:27,460
Really?

2205
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:28,200
Interesting.

2206
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:29,140
What a...

2207
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:29,980
What nonsense.

2208
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:30,500
Yeah!

2209
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:34,440
Okay, okay.

2210
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:35,780
No.

2211
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:36,520
No, no.

2212
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:37,600
No, no, no, no, no, no.

2213
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:38,880
Wait, it won't let me do anymore.

2214
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:39,480
Why?

2215
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:41,220
Please!

2216
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,800
You'll have to speak with Shum-Gro-Yah-Rug about that.

2217
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:48,940
He's the only one that can handle the deed.

2218
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,420
That guy is useless to me.

2219
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:53,600
Count Skingrad is a very private person.

2220
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,500
I handle all the county's public affairs and consult with the count when necessary.

2221
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,080
Scum.

2222
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,260
Yeah, scam.

2223
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:02,380
Yeah.

2224
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:06,660
More like scam whatever his name is.

2225
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,320
My speech craft has increased.

2226
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:10,440
Ayo.

2227
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:11,000
Shh.

2228
01:26:11,780 --> 01:26:12,420
Scam.

2229
01:26:12,580 --> 01:26:13,120
Grow.

2230
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:14,120
Yarrug.

2231
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,720
Screw you.

2232
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:17,900
How goes it?

2233
01:26:18,020 --> 01:26:19,540
How do I put my fists away?

2234
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:20,680
Oh.

2235
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:21,580
Okay, I did it.

2236
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:24,600
The count will not see you now.

2237
01:26:24,860 --> 01:26:25,860
Not now.

2238
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,180
Not ever.

2239
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:27,520
Oh.

2240
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:28,980
He sees no one.

2241
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:38,720
Can an alien and a lizard find love in the court of Skingrad?

2242
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:39,840
Right?

2243
01:26:41,260 --> 01:26:41,280
Right?

2244
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,540
That Dennis Artillion is a little too full of himself.

2245
01:26:43,820 --> 01:26:46,560
Sure, he's a captain of the guard, but I'm not impressed.

2246
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:48,240
Wow, that's some real tea.

2247
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,680
Okay, okay.

2248
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:54,860
Wander the streets, fields, and public places of Skingrad to your heart's content.

2249
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,930
Just don't include me in your social explorations.

2250
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:01,500
What about...

2251
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:05,200
What about bodily explorations?

2252
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,060
I'm listening.

2253
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:09,960
He's already at 45.

2254
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:12,320
Maybe he'll really like me.

2255
01:27:12,540 --> 01:27:13,080
Let's see.

2256
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,760
He really likes a boast.

2257
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:18,680
Hates admire.

2258
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:20,280
Okay, we gotta hurry.

2259
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:22,260
Coerce is okay.

2260
01:27:24,580 --> 01:27:25,500
We'll do this.

2261
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,060
Really likes the boast.

2262
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:29,020
Such adventures.

2263
01:27:29,380 --> 01:27:31,020
How I envy you.

2264
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,520
That's just not funny.

2265
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:32,900
Oh, wait.

2266
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:33,480
I messed up.

2267
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:34,760
I can't argue with that.

2268
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:35,300
That's okay.

2269
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:36,640
It's my birthday.

2270
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:38,640
So...

2271
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:40,100
Have some of my birthday fun.

2272
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:40,380
No!

2273
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:44,080
Instead, can you wish me happy birthday in true Mido fashion?

2274
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:48,760
Is it...

2275
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,480
Anyway...

2276
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,780
Anyway...

2277
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,000
Ah...

2278
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:58,740
Made fashion.

2279
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,800
Um...

2280
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:04,820
Either is fine.

2281
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,840
Wait, but I want to get it right.

2282
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,780
Happy birthday!

2283
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,500
Moe, moe!

2284
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,520
Magical Kyururun!

2285
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:19,060
Birthday beam!

2286
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,180
That should work.

2287
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,400
Happy birthday!

2288
01:28:29,940 --> 01:28:30,680
Yeah.

2289
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:36,360
Um... I don't think we got anywhere with that.

2290
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:37,140
But that's okay.

2291
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,680
Uh, we'll do jokes.

2292
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:41,220
Hilarious.

2293
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:42,460
I can't argue.

2294
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,800
Don't waste your flattery on me.

2295
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:45,120
Oh my god.

2296
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,480
Is his face okay?

2297
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:47,920
It's getting wider.

2298
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:50,840
Is it getting wider to anybody else or is it just me?

2299
01:28:52,180 --> 01:28:53,360
Uh, uh-oh.

2300
01:28:53,680 --> 01:28:54,180
Unlucky.

2301
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,160
Um...

2302
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,140
You win this one.

2303
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,160
Don't talk such rot.

2304
01:29:00,420 --> 01:29:01,960
That's just not gracious.

2305
01:29:02,380 --> 01:29:03,280
What a hero!

2306
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,340
What a hero!

2307
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,220
Uh, oh, oh, oh.

2308
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:11,220
Which one would be better?

2309
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,020
Ah!

2310
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:14,860
Not now.

2311
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:15,820
Not late.

2312
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:17,160
That's just not funny.

2313
01:29:18,140 --> 01:29:18,700
Uh...

2314
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:19,740
Such adventure.

2315
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:20,760
You've got a point.

2316
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:21,920
I've got a point.

2317
01:29:22,020 --> 01:29:22,220
Okay.

2318
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:23,400
Ugh!

2319
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:24,700
Ugh!

2320
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,860
I can't talk to him anymore.

2321
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:29,140
Okay, bye-bye.

2322
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:30,460
Farewell.

2323
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:31,240
Farewell.

2324
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:35,220
You said he won't talk to me, but what if...

2325
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,480
A visitor, yes.

2326
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:39,380
Oh, who's opened the door?

2327
01:29:40,180 --> 01:29:41,000
Wait, downstairs?

2328
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:44,780
Oh, I think he left.

2329
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:47,700
He really didn't want to talk to me.

2330
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:49,180
Is that him?

2331
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:49,920
Is that our guy?

2332
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,020
Okay.

2333
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,740
I still gotta go find my horse.

2334
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:57,460
Wait.

2335
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,980
Some doors are opening.

2336
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:02,740
Lord's Manor.

2337
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:03,420
Okay.

2338
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:06,520
Dining hall.

2339
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:08,180
Why is that even off-limits?

2340
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:09,820
Good evening.

2341
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:10,320
Hello.

2342
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:11,160
Excuse me.

2343
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,880
I'm exploring.

2344
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:15,580
What?

2345
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,180
I can't even go to the courtyard!

2346
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,240
I can't even go there!

2347
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:25,620
But that's where I have to leave to!

2348
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,200
Something I can help you with?

2349
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:29,820
Um...

2350
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:30,920
Nah, you don't know anything.

2351
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:31,540
Bye.

2352
01:30:32,060 --> 01:30:32,480
Bye.

2353
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,100
I'm trapped.

2354
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,340
I'm banned from everything.

2355
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,260
Is it because I'm a criminal?

2356
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:39,040
I'm criminal scum.

2357
01:30:43,780 --> 01:30:44,320
Oh.

2358
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:45,740
It's night time now.

2359
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:54,750
Well, the other place wasn't so far away.

2360
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:56,130
I believe we can get it.

2361
01:30:57,990 --> 01:31:00,210
I believe we can get to there.

2362
01:31:00,350 --> 01:31:00,770
Okay, hold on.

2363
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:02,910
Let's activate our quest.

2364
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:03,870
Let's do...

2365
01:31:03,870 --> 01:31:04,770
Not the sunken one.

2366
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,790
We did that and he told me nothing.

2367
01:31:11,130 --> 01:31:12,250
We need to be more famous.

2368
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:15,130
We need to be like an influencer to live there, apparently.

2369
01:31:17,370 --> 01:31:17,850
Um...

2370
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:18,630
Find the air.

2371
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:19,390
There we go.

2372
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,810
Okay.

2373
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:30,620
That way?

2374
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:36,260
Oh, we're still inside.

2375
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:36,360
What?

2376
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:39,980
Okay.

2377
01:31:41,140 --> 01:31:41,320
Oh.

2378
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:43,480
Boy, where am I going?

2379
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:44,980
East gate.

2380
01:31:45,540 --> 01:31:45,740
Whoa.

2381
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:52,500
If the smallest wedge is on a negative emotion at the start, pick that one first.

2382
01:31:52,680 --> 01:31:54,980
It sets you up better odds of not losing risk.

2383
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,900
Yeah, that's what I tried to do before.

2384
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:57,660
Hmm.

2385
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,060
10,000.

2386
01:31:59,220 --> 01:31:59,640
Welcome to membership.

2387
01:31:59,860 --> 01:32:00,280
Thank you.

2388
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,860
Oh, we're at the town now.

2389
01:32:07,200 --> 01:32:07,840
Oh.

2390
01:32:08,720 --> 01:32:09,560
Is this free?

2391
01:32:11,220 --> 01:32:11,860
Okay.

2392
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,260
Look at the little fireflies.

2393
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,840
I'm not a criminal anymore.

2394
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:17,660
Greetings, Bosmer.

2395
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:18,760
Bosmer?

2396
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,240
That's not my name.

2397
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:21,820
My name is Etina.

2398
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:24,720
Guard house.

2399
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,420
Wait, we should sell my stuff here.

2400
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:33,700
Oh, it's a wood elf.

2401
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:34,560
Whoa.

2402
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:35,920
Wait, what the heck is this?

2403
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:38,880
If I stand on it, will I get hurt?

2404
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:45,470
My feet are made of...

2405
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,650
Hammer and tongs.

2406
01:32:58,280 --> 01:32:59,020
What was that?

2407
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,540
Oh, my acrobatics increased.

2408
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:01,460
Oh, gosh.

2409
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,320
I thought someone was about to attack me.

2410
01:33:03,860 --> 01:33:04,920
Hello, fowl.

2411
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:05,700
Oh.

2412
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:07,560
That's an unfortunate name.

2413
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:10,540
One more coin and I can get a pair of shoes.

2414
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:23,660
His eyes are red.

2415
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:24,440
He must be...

2416
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,960
His eyes are so red and swollen.

2417
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:31,340
He's probably crying every day about how his parents didn't love him.

2418
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,940
To name him this.

2419
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:42,260
It's okay.

2420
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:43,740
It's okay, fowl.

2421
01:33:44,680 --> 01:33:45,760
It's okay.

2422
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:48,960
Somebody will love you.

2423
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:54,360
Anyone looking for work should consider the fighter's guilt.

2424
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:57,780
I hear they're always looking for recruits.

2425
01:33:58,120 --> 01:33:58,360
Oh.

2426
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,320
A guy named Gray Fox.

2427
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,780
He's a fairy tale.

2428
01:34:02,940 --> 01:34:03,480
Oh, gosh.

2429
01:34:03,700 --> 01:34:11,160
The Imperial Watch pretends there is a thief king named the Gray Fox who controls all the thieves in Cyrodiil.

2430
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,980
I don't think I...

2431
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,800
Of course, it's all just made up to give them an excuse to keep us down.

2432
01:34:15,980 --> 01:34:16,300
Yeah.

2433
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:17,660
I...

2434
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:19,320
This guy, I don't trust his eyes.

2435
01:34:19,780 --> 01:34:21,580
He might be diseased or something.

2436
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:23,080
Um...

2437
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:25,560
Blessings of stendor upon you.

2438
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:27,380
See, I would give you some...

2439
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,880
I would give you some money, but I'm also, you know...

2440
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:32,500
I'm pretty, uh...

2441
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:36,000
Pretty low myself, so...

2442
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,700
You know, you understand, right?

2443
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:38,580
Fowl.

2444
01:34:40,300 --> 01:34:40,860
Anyway...

2445
01:34:40,860 --> 01:34:41,680
I hope you...

2446
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,380
There's actually some shoes in here.

2447
01:34:43,780 --> 01:34:45,260
You can put those on.

2448
01:34:47,820 --> 01:34:49,720
He needs some eye drops.

2449
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:54,720
Swear a coin for the infirm.

2450
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:55,980
Oh, golly.

2451
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:57,100
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

2452
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,020
Okay, I can't leave.

2453
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:01,060
Um...

2454
01:35:01,060 --> 01:35:01,640
There we go.

2455
01:35:02,040 --> 01:35:02,620
Goodbye!

2456
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,980
It's raining.

2457
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:09,080
Here we go!

2458
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,040
Traitors!

2459
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:12,080
Wait, why can't...

2460
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:12,980
What time is it?

2461
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:14,480
Oh, it's only...

2462
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:15,440
It's not even 10pm!

2463
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:15,940
Please!

2464
01:35:17,980 --> 01:35:19,480
Mage's Guild.

2465
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:26,250
Pickpocket shoes into his inventory!

2466
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:28,470
Hello.

2467
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:31,670
Oh.

2468
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:34,310
Druya!

2469
01:35:36,310 --> 01:35:40,450
What's a serodilic?

2470
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:41,230
Is that the language?

2471
01:35:42,390 --> 01:35:44,350
It's a town, like any other.

2472
01:35:44,910 --> 01:35:48,710
Well, go outside and there's the mountains and wines and sheep.

2473
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:51,350
Here in town, though, nothing special.

2474
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:52,030
Okay.

2475
01:35:53,630 --> 01:35:56,950
The Mage's Guild runs more or less like it always did.

2476
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:01,630
But we lost quite a few members when the practice of necromancy was banned.

2477
01:36:02,150 --> 01:36:04,010
Why was necromancy banned?

2478
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:11,870
Adriana can make you a member of the guild if you can convince her to take her nose out of whatever book she's reading.

2479
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:12,850
I don't know.

2480
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,730
I'm not really into...

2481
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:14,890
Wait.

2482
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:15,790
Train?

2483
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:17,130
Purchase spells?

2484
01:36:17,290 --> 01:36:19,090
I'm not really into being a mage.

2485
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:23,270
There are rumors that the Nords are attempting to capture the whole of Solstheim.

2486
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:26,650
And remove the Imperial fort on the island.

2487
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:27,230
Oh, gosh.

2488
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:30,050
This guy looks like that guy that appears in your dreams.

2489
01:36:30,210 --> 01:36:32,690
It seems that Skyrim is always involved in a border dispute.

2490
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,010
You know what I'm talking about?

2491
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:35,410
Farewell.

2492
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:39,910
This guy looks like the guy that... they're like, have you seen this man in your dreams?

2493
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:40,530
Hello.

2494
01:36:42,690 --> 01:36:44,710
That's what he looks like to me.

2495
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:46,210
Of course.

2496
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:47,650
Have you seen this man?

2497
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:49,770
Some strange stories about Count Hasildur.

2498
01:36:50,570 --> 01:36:52,350
I'm sure they couldn't be true, though.

2499
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:55,330
Maybe there's something strange going on.

2500
01:36:55,530 --> 01:36:57,970
But Skingrad is a well-run city.

2501
01:36:58,170 --> 01:36:58,890
I have a question.

2502
01:36:59,650 --> 01:37:00,230
Are, like...

2503
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:01,790
Goodbye.

2504
01:37:02,870 --> 01:37:06,370
Are, like, a lot... are there timed missions in this game?

2505
01:37:06,370 --> 01:37:09,470
Or if it's like, I don't get to the city in time, or something, something?

2506
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,050
I'm listening.

2507
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,490
Please, go ahead.

2508
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,950
What?

2509
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,210
No?

2510
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:13,910
Oh, okay.

2511
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:14,490
That's so nice.

2512
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:16,070
I'm rather busy right now.

2513
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:18,870
Oh, is this about joining the Mages Guild?

2514
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:22,090
I suppose I could spare the time, if necessary.

2515
01:37:22,430 --> 01:37:22,910
Oh, sure.

2516
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:24,670
Uh, yeah, I'll join... okay.

2517
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:25,850
Join the Mages Guild.

2518
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:26,150
Why not?

2519
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:27,370
You're interested in joining?

2520
01:37:27,990 --> 01:37:29,910
Great things will be expected of you.

2521
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:32,230
Are you sure you're ready for it?

2522
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:38,760
Just for lore, they make it seem urgent.

2523
01:37:38,920 --> 01:37:39,820
Okay, that's so...

2524
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:42,040
That's so... such a relief.

2525
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:44,280
Wait, can I join multiple things?

2526
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:49,100
Can I join multiple guilds?

2527
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,160
There's no downside.

2528
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:50,800
You can?

2529
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:51,260
Okay.

2530
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:52,340
I join the guild.

2531
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:55,100
Then, you are now an associate of the Mages Guild.

2532
01:37:55,360 --> 01:38:01,920
You must receive a recommendation from every local guild hall in Cyrodiil before you may advance through the ranks of the guild.

2533
01:38:02,300 --> 01:38:08,580
In the meantime, as a member of the guild, you now have full access to the guild halls around Cyrodiil.

2534
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:11,960
Only the Arcane University is closed to you.

2535
01:38:12,100 --> 01:38:12,340
Oh.

2536
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:13,720
Because I'm stupid.

2537
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,680
I joined the Mages Guild.

2538
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:17,880
Cool.

2539
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,180
Um...

2540
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:19,440
What?

2541
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,420
You want a tour?

2542
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,940
Can't you see I have a lot on my mind?

2543
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,040
Go bother a beggar or a guard.

2544
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,120
They stand around and chatter all day.

2545
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:28,100
I just joined!

2546
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,200
Why are you so rude to me?

2547
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:29,380
She...

2548
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:32,040
She butters you up to join the guild, and then once...

2549
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,700
Once you're in, she verbally abuses you.

2550
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:39,980
Okay, fine.

2551
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:44,500
It's been the home of the Mages Guild for the longest time.

2552
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,400
You should see the library they have there.

2553
01:38:47,640 --> 01:38:50,620
Except I can't because you barred me from the...

2554
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:52,000
...university.

2555
01:38:52,480 --> 01:38:55,560
I only make the trip if I can't find a specific book here.

2556
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:58,200
I can't go to the university!

2557
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,360
You said I can't go there!

2558
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:06,500
I don't mean to gossip, but he is more than a bit strange.

2559
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:10,640
However, he's always been tolerated as the town eccentric.

2560
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:12,500
Okay.

2561
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:13,460
Who?

2562
01:39:14,580 --> 01:39:15,260
Glarthir?

2563
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:17,140
Glarthir.

2564
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:18,280
Recommendation.

2565
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:19,900
I'm afraid I haven't given it much thought.

2566
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,960
I'm rather busy, you understand.

2567
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:25,500
My research occupies nearly all of my time.

2568
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:26,180
Oh.

2569
01:39:26,180 --> 01:39:31,320
Now that I think about it, I do have a small problem concerning Erthor.

2570
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:32,060
Erthor?

2571
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:33,140
He's one of the guild mages here.

2572
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:35,620
Think you can do something about it?

2573
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:37,160
Glarthir is a funny guy?

2574
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:37,560
Okay.

2575
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,720
Oh, sure, I'll take it.

2576
01:39:38,720 --> 01:39:39,040
Excellent.

2577
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:41,500
I just don't have the time to search for him again.

2578
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,760
But I do need to consult him about some notes he borrowed.

2579
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:45,140
Okay.

2580
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,400
You might want to ask around and see if anyone can be of some help.

2581
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:51,500
Let me know when he's back and you'll have your recommendation.

2582
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:52,000
Oh!

2583
01:39:52,980 --> 01:39:55,960
So I'm looking for a guy.

2584
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:01,160
Have Erthor see me when he gets back, associate.

2585
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:02,240
Erthor associate.

2586
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:03,820
I have a name.

2587
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:04,840
Please.

2588
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:05,700
I'm Etina.

2589
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:06,800
I'm very respectable.

2590
01:40:07,940 --> 01:40:08,160
Wait.

2591
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:09,840
Now I can take anything in here.

2592
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:12,140
Because I'm a member of the guild!

2593
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:14,440
Oh.

2594
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:15,740
I didn't even...

2595
01:40:15,740 --> 01:40:15,980
Wait.

2596
01:40:16,120 --> 01:40:16,620
Soul gem.

2597
01:40:17,820 --> 01:40:19,040
Fundamentals of alchemy.

2598
01:40:34,210 --> 01:40:36,750
I was interested in these fire salts.

2599
01:40:36,930 --> 01:40:39,050
I've heard some strange stories about Count Hasildo.

2600
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:39,490
Oh, here.

2601
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:41,310
I'm sure they couldn't be true, though.

2602
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:44,830
Maybe there's something strange going on.

2603
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:46,230
What is it, associate?

2604
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,650
Oh!

2605
01:40:48,970 --> 01:40:49,550
It's...

2606
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:50,470
It's...

2607
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:50,590
Oh!

2608
01:40:51,030 --> 01:40:51,370
Ah!

2609
01:40:52,230 --> 01:40:53,390
Sinus Valinus!

2610
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:55,790
We found him!

2611
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:57,230
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2612
01:40:57,630 --> 01:40:58,250
Come back, come back.

2613
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,730
Don't leave.

2614
01:40:59,210 --> 01:41:01,290
I hear you got quite a task from Adriana.

2615
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:02,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2616
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:03,710
Um...

2617
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:04,510
Skingrad.

2618
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:06,550
Have you met Adriana Berenna?

2619
01:41:06,670 --> 01:41:08,410
Our Skingrad mages guild head?

2620
01:41:08,850 --> 01:41:10,970
Not the most pleasant person, I'll admit.

2621
01:41:11,370 --> 01:41:11,430
Heh.

2622
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:12,950
Don't mind her.

2623
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:15,050
What was I supposed to do with this guy?

2624
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:15,790
I can't remember.

2625
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:19,210
Do the conjuration courses, and Druja does the mysticism.

2626
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:22,750
Is he okay?

2627
01:41:23,230 --> 01:41:24,030
Probably not.

2628
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:26,570
Um...

2629
01:41:26,570 --> 01:41:27,130
Rumors.

2630
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:29,890
Necromancy may be legal in Cyrodiil.

2631
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:34,430
But few will openly admit to practicing it now that the mages guild has banned it.

2632
01:41:34,430 --> 01:41:35,230
Oh, the conjuration.

2633
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:36,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2634
01:41:36,690 --> 01:41:38,310
I'm here to help if you need me.

2635
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:39,070
Thank you, sir.

2636
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:40,510
Oh, we can go into the basement.

2637
01:41:40,510 --> 01:41:40,770
Oh.

2638
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:42,450
I have a key!

2639
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:43,750
The mages guild key!

2640
01:41:53,560 --> 01:41:55,260
Maybe they left some gold in here.

2641
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:56,360
Oh my gosh.

2642
01:41:56,560 --> 01:41:56,960
I can...

2643
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:57,820
I can eat?

2644
01:41:59,080 --> 01:41:59,520
Wow.

2645
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:01,540
Being a member of the guild is awesome!

2646
01:42:03,480 --> 01:42:04,560
Everything is free!

2647
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:12,080
Huh.

2648
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:12,420
Huh.

2649
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:12,920
Huh.

2650
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,880
Good thing I don't have to eat or do anything in this.

2651
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:18,680
In this game.

2652
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:20,980
Don't mind me.

2653
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:25,660
What?

2654
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,260
What do you mean by that?

2655
01:42:27,460 --> 01:42:28,360
Electurn.

2656
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,380
Biography of Berenziah.

2657
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:33,940
Oh, I didn't...

2658
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:35,320
Uh...

2659
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,280
What is that?

2660
01:42:39,940 --> 01:42:40,900
Okay.

2661
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:42,500
Hello!

2662
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:42,960
Hello there!

2663
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:44,080
Hello!

2664
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:46,180
Viggy.

2665
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:47,660
Greetings, apprentice.

2666
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,020
Well met.

2667
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:52,100
I've seen Shamir at the Tamika Vig...

2668
01:42:52,100 --> 01:42:54,000
Green brocade doublet.

2669
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:54,740
He's really good.

2670
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:56,580
I might try to get some...

2671
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:57,160
Hold on.

2672
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,120
Hold your horses, everybody.

2673
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,200
Oh!

2674
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:02,800
I need pants for this one.

2675
01:43:06,200 --> 01:43:08,160
We've got some burgundy linens.

2676
01:43:08,340 --> 01:43:10,200
Wait, this one's cleaner than...

2677
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:13,140
This one's cleaner than our current outfit.

2678
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:17,000
This one's cleaner.

2679
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:19,720
Because this one's got dirt all over it.

2680
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:20,380
It's disgusting.

2681
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,240
I think we should...

2682
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:23,240
I think we should change.

2683
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:24,260
Wait.

2684
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:25,800
I don't need a ring on.

2685
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:26,580
I'm gonna sell that.

2686
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:27,300
Wait.

2687
01:43:27,420 --> 01:43:27,820
What's this?

2688
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:29,040
Folded cloth.

2689
01:43:31,660 --> 01:43:33,980
Green silk garment.

2690
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:36,000
Hold on.

2691
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:36,620
Hold on.

2692
01:43:38,380 --> 01:43:40,520
Enjoying Minto's new Elder Scrolls era.

2693
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:44,860
Always refreshing to someone play Oblivion for the first time and getting immersed in the shenanigans.

2694
01:43:45,660 --> 01:43:46,620
I'm immersed.

2695
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:47,820
Oh!

2696
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:49,360
Wow!

2697
01:43:49,620 --> 01:43:50,660
She's really styled.

2698
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:50,920
Okay.

2699
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:52,320
Let's put these in here.

2700
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:54,060
Someone might wash them.

2701
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:54,780
You know what I mean?

2702
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:56,500
So...

2703
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:57,220
Uh...

2704
01:43:58,940 --> 01:44:00,340
When did I get this?

2705
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:02,520
Oh!

2706
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:03,720
That's a mushroom.

2707
01:44:04,860 --> 01:44:05,400
Hehehehe.

2708
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:13,200
How do you do?

2709
01:44:15,700 --> 01:44:16,240
Alright.

2710
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,460
Let's go find that guy.

2711
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:24,440
Uh...

2712
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:25,820
Uh...

2713
01:44:27,120 --> 01:44:27,700
Uh...

2714
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:29,180
Let's go find that guy.

2715
01:44:29,620 --> 01:44:31,020
He's the eccentric one.

2716
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:32,780
We got an inn here.

2717
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:34,800
Fighters guild?

2718
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:36,400
I could join all the guilds.

2719
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:36,980
Hahaha.

2720
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:41,160
Let's see over here.

2721
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:42,200
West gate.

2722
01:44:46,650 --> 01:44:47,230
Nothing.

2723
01:44:52,370 --> 01:44:53,210
Remenbroder's house.

2724
01:44:53,870 --> 01:44:55,150
This guy might have a bed.

2725
01:44:55,870 --> 01:44:57,190
Yeah, it's kinda rainy, huh?

2726
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:00,570
Oh!

2727
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:01,070
Oh!

2728
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:01,950
Gosh, you scared me.

2729
01:45:02,130 --> 01:45:02,930
Raymond Broder.

2730
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:04,130
Retired archer.

2731
01:45:04,950 --> 01:45:05,270
An archer!

2732
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:06,330
An archer!

2733
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:07,650
That's what I am.

2734
01:45:09,570 --> 01:45:10,630
Wait, an archery?

2735
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,070
That might be good for me, actually.

2736
01:45:13,070 --> 01:45:14,750
Not only does Shamir make a good mind...

2737
01:45:14,750 --> 01:45:15,490
And thank you for the bread!

2738
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:18,630
He's really good with his bow, too.

2739
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:20,630
I heard he'll train you.

2740
01:45:21,110 --> 01:45:21,730
For a fee.

2741
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:22,650
Wait, that's good!

2742
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:23,330
That's good!

2743
01:45:23,710 --> 01:45:26,990
I served as a legion marksman for 20 years.

2744
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,650
I retired here to Skingrad.

2745
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:30,910
Work in the vineyards.

2746
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:33,990
And supplement my income as an advanced trainer.

2747
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:35,350
Okay.

2748
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:36,910
Wait, so who is it?

2749
01:45:37,390 --> 01:45:38,830
I don't mean to gossip.

2750
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:39,950
But he is.

2751
01:45:40,110 --> 01:45:41,890
Oh, that's Glarthir.

2752
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:44,930
Not only does Shamir make a good wine...

2753
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:45,190
Shamir!

2754
01:45:46,370 --> 01:45:47,830
Shamir at the vineyards!

2755
01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:48,650
Okay.

2756
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:50,190
What do you have upstairs?

2757
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:50,670
A bed?

2758
01:45:52,440 --> 01:45:52,910
Goodnight.

2759
01:45:55,590 --> 01:45:56,530
For...

2760
01:45:56,530 --> 01:45:57,510
Until morning.

2761
01:45:59,590 --> 01:46:01,210
What, like...

2762
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:02,190
Eight hours?

2763
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:04,290
Yeah.

2764
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:12,150
Oh, oh.

2765
01:46:13,350 --> 01:46:14,790
Oh my god!

2766
01:46:15,090 --> 01:46:15,770
Who are you?

2767
01:46:22,920 --> 01:46:24,320
What's happening?

2768
01:46:26,020 --> 01:46:27,760
Oh, I was just looking.

2769
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,540
Who was that lady?

2770
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:30,020
Wait.

2771
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:30,740
Hold on.

2772
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:31,760
We gotta go find her.

2773
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:33,820
I heard her leave.

2774
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:42,940
There, you!

2775
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:44,600
Aren't you an ugly one?

2776
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,400
Oh, you're one to talk.

2777
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:47,920
I don't have time to talk.

2778
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:50,040
Mysterious note.

2779
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:51,120
Hey, I don't read them.

2780
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,560
I just deliver them.

2781
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:54,140
Okay.

2782
01:46:54,140 --> 01:46:54,420
Hi.

2783
01:46:55,800 --> 01:46:56,780
My Verna.

2784
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,740
I have things to do.

2785
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:03,800
What, is this like the dumpy part of town?

2786
01:47:04,180 --> 01:47:04,860
Goodness.

2787
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:07,620
It's ugly over here.

2788
01:47:11,500 --> 01:47:12,260
Alright.

2789
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:13,060
Ugly.

2790
01:47:14,020 --> 01:47:15,080
Over here!

2791
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:17,640
Yes, you...

2792
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,400
We can't talk here.

2793
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,400
Too public.

2794
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:23,560
Meet me behind the great chapel at midnight.

2795
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:25,360
Don't let anyone follow you.

2796
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:27,680
I'll make it worth your while.

2797
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:28,680
Okay.

2798
01:47:29,560 --> 01:47:31,160
Oh, I just slept though.

2799
01:47:32,540 --> 01:47:33,060
Midnight?

2800
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:33,840
Oh, wait.

2801
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:35,440
How did it become 4am?

2802
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:37,180
I slept for like 8 hours, no?

2803
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:41,400
Wait, wait, wait.

2804
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:41,780
Come here.

2805
01:47:43,940 --> 01:47:44,460
Oh, okay.

2806
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,100
Okay.

2807
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,160
We can't be seen talking together.

2808
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:47,840
Okay.

2809
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,140
Bye-bye.

2810
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:49,300
No.

2811
01:47:49,620 --> 01:47:52,720
I don't know the way to the Imperial City.

2812
01:47:53,220 --> 01:47:54,380
You'll have to ask someone else.

2813
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:55,700
The lady woke me up.

2814
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,000
Okay.

2815
01:47:57,400 --> 01:47:57,720
Okay.

2816
01:47:58,280 --> 01:47:58,500
Okay.

2817
01:47:58,900 --> 01:47:59,740
I'll put my fist away.

2818
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:03,720
Uh...

2819
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,000
Okay.

2820
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,540
Um, well then.

2821
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:08,960
What should we do?

2822
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:10,060
Okay.

2823
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:10,140
Wait.

2824
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:11,560
I found the guy.

2825
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:12,460
I found him.

2826
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:13,460
Hahaha.

2827
01:48:14,340 --> 01:48:15,460
You could sleep in the guild.

2828
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:17,220
Yeah, let's go back to the guild.

2829
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,400
Runnin', runnin', runnin',

2830
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:24,560
runnin', runnin'.

2831
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:24,880
Ha!

2832
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:26,780
Alright.

2833
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:27,840
What's this place?

2834
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:28,780
Oh, this is the inn.

2835
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:30,040
I don't want to spend money there.

2836
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:31,600
That's the fighter's guild.

2837
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,520
Not allowed in there, apparently.

2838
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:35,640
Everybody's asleep, that's why.

2839
01:48:36,060 --> 01:48:36,700
Check the note.

2840
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:37,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2841
01:48:37,580 --> 01:48:38,260
You're right, you're right.

2842
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:41,220
Our note.

2843
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:46,280
Uh...

2844
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:47,060
Miscellaneous?

2845
01:48:49,380 --> 01:48:50,420
Mysterious note.

2846
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:51,920
Oh!

2847
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,960
I can offer you greater rewards and less time in prison.

2848
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,500
If you are interested, come to the garden...

2849
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:00,820
Gar...

2850
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,200
Wait, wait, wait.

2851
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:05,000
Okay.

2852
01:49:05,360 --> 01:49:05,840
Come...

2853
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:11,480
Come to the garden of Derloth in the Imperial City's waterfront district at midnight.

2854
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:14,480
Present this note and all shall be made clear.

2855
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:16,140
Gray Fox!

2856
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:16,760
Ah!

2857
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:25,070
Oh my god!

2858
01:49:27,570 --> 01:49:29,690
No freaking way!

2859
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:31,410
Wait, where are the beds?

2860
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:35,970
Upstairs?

2861
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,130
Upstairs?

2862
01:49:38,650 --> 01:49:40,070
Ah, the living quarters!

2863
01:49:41,590 --> 01:49:42,190
Nice!

2864
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:45,590
Wait, so...

2865
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:47,370
Oh!

2866
01:49:47,910 --> 01:49:48,370
Oh!

2867
01:49:48,710 --> 01:49:48,910
Oh!

2868
01:49:49,650 --> 01:49:50,250
Uh...

2869
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,270
What time is it?

2870
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:54,030
Do you guys all wake up at 4.49?

2871
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:55,890
Or...

2872
01:49:55,890 --> 01:49:57,730
Wait, why did they just go in there together?

2873
01:49:58,050 --> 01:49:58,250
Oh!

2874
01:49:59,890 --> 01:50:01,190
What is it, associate?

2875
01:50:01,190 --> 01:50:03,270
What you're having...

2876
01:50:03,270 --> 01:50:04,150
Is this...

2877
01:50:04,150 --> 01:50:04,530
Ah!

2878
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:05,950
Can I join?

2879
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:11,000
Be Frank Yeager.

2880
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:12,320
Oh, sorry.

2881
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,220
I'll leave.

2882
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:17,760
I'm here to help if you need me.

2883
01:50:18,040 --> 01:50:18,500
Thank you.

2884
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,140
You're...

2885
01:50:19,140 --> 01:50:19,940
You're so kind.

2886
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:22,520
Most people are not so kind to me here.

2887
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:29,350
Don't mind me.

2888
01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,730
I'm just checking out the...

2889
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:31,870
The...

2890
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:32,650
The wares.

2891
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:34,530
And I moonwalk out.

2892
01:50:35,610 --> 01:50:37,070
I'm gonna sleep with this lady.

2893
01:50:37,290 --> 01:50:39,490
If I sleep for...

2894
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:41,250
Until midnight...

2895
01:50:41,250 --> 01:50:42,850
How much time would that be?

2896
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:46,570
12 hours would be 5 p.m.

2897
01:50:47,210 --> 01:50:47,790
6...

2898
01:50:47,790 --> 01:50:48,570
7...

2899
01:50:48,570 --> 01:50:49,550
8...

2900
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:50,190
9...

2901
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:50,690
10...

2902
01:50:51,970 --> 01:50:52,550
11...

2903
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:54,410
18 hours?

2904
01:50:58,310 --> 01:50:59,680
19 hours is...

2905
01:51:02,550 --> 01:51:04,070
So if I do 18 hours...

2906
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:04,210
Wait.

2907
01:51:04,450 --> 01:51:05,510
But I don't know where to go.

2908
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:06,610
So I'm gonna do...

2909
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:07,810
I'm gonna do...

2910
01:51:07,810 --> 01:51:08,930
A little...

2911
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:10,790
A little more...

2912
01:51:12,530 --> 01:51:13,490
So that...

2913
01:51:13,490 --> 01:51:14,570
Or a little...

2914
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:15,430
Like a little less.

2915
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:16,850
So that I can find it.

2916
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,270
Time is really fast here.

2917
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:32,220
Where was I supposed to go?

2918
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:37,620
Oh, do I wanna trade?

2919
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:38,500
You're right.

2920
01:51:38,780 --> 01:51:39,700
Let's go trade first.

2921
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:43,280
Uh...

2922
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:44,000
I'm lost?

2923
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,620
Wait, here it is.

2924
01:51:44,620 --> 01:51:45,700
Wait, what's this?

2925
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:47,440
Display case?

2926
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:50,020
I'm part of the guild.

2927
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:51,420
Why is it locked, huh?

2928
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,160
Latest dream of glad to be here.

2929
01:51:53,260 --> 01:51:53,540
Greetings, apprentice.

2930
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:54,220
Thank you!

2931
01:51:54,340 --> 01:51:54,980
Well met.

2932
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:58,980
Is it me, or is it quieter around here with Urthor missing?

2933
01:51:59,380 --> 01:51:59,740
Urthor.

2934
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:00,020
Of course.

2935
01:52:06,180 --> 01:52:06,680
Uh...

2936
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:08,020
No, not the Imperial city.

2937
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:08,810
We're trying to do...

2938
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:10,820
Uh...

2939
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:11,040
G...

2940
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:11,600
G...

2941
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:12,300
G...

2942
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,020
G...

2943
01:52:13,020 --> 01:52:13,440
G...

2944
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:14,640
Glizzi's.

2945
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,720
Hammer and Tongs.

2946
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:21,160
Oh gosh, where was that place?

2947
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:22,260
I was trying to find.

2948
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:27,020
There was a...

2949
01:52:27,020 --> 01:52:27,900
There was a...

2950
01:52:29,180 --> 01:52:29,820
Larthir?

2951
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:30,400
Yeah.

2952
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:31,440
Him.

2953
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,380
There was...

2954
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:33,500
There was...

2955
01:52:33,500 --> 01:52:33,940
A...

2956
01:52:34,620 --> 01:52:35,180
Store...

2957
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:35,880
That was like...

2958
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:36,840
Traders, or whatever.

2959
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:40,200
I lost it.

2960
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:50,120
Have mercy.

2961
01:52:50,580 --> 01:52:52,180
Just one coin.

2962
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:53,780
It's next to the Mage's Guild.

2963
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:54,340
It is?

2964
01:52:56,460 --> 01:52:57,200
Book it.

2965
01:52:57,940 --> 01:52:58,780
Book it, E.

2966
01:52:58,860 --> 01:52:59,080
Tina.

2967
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:01,700
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da...

2968
01:53:01,700 --> 01:53:02,540
Da-da-da-da-da...

2969
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:04,120
It was right in front?

2970
01:53:05,660 --> 01:53:06,400
My bad.

2971
01:53:07,360 --> 01:53:07,840
Wait...

2972
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,180
I'm a little lost.

2973
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,040
Where did I come from?

2974
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:10,560
This way.

2975
01:53:13,240 --> 01:53:13,720
Riiiight...

2976
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:13,920
No!

2977
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:19,330
This way.

2978
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:23,130
Here...

2979
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:24,490
Alright, let's...

2980
01:53:24,490 --> 01:53:25,110
Let's...

2981
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:26,410
Let's sell our stuff.

2982
01:53:26,790 --> 01:53:28,130
Let's make some more money.

2983
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:30,990
Hello.

2984
01:53:31,590 --> 01:53:31,930
What?

2985
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:32,710
What?

2986
01:53:33,090 --> 01:53:33,510
Hi.

2987
01:53:34,530 --> 01:53:37,470
Marie Palliella is quite a hard worker.

2988
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:41,870
She's in the chapel, day and night, tending to the sick and injured.

2989
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:42,490
What?

2990
01:53:43,690 --> 01:53:44,530
Thank you.

2991
01:53:45,090 --> 01:53:45,670
Goodbye.

2992
01:53:46,070 --> 01:53:46,310
Goodbye.

2993
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:47,330
Hello.

2994
01:53:48,430 --> 01:53:53,210
Welcome to Kolovian Traders, Skingrad's finest selection of general merchandise.

2995
01:53:53,650 --> 01:53:53,870
Gunder.

2996
01:53:53,950 --> 01:53:54,650
I'm Gunder.

2997
01:53:54,970 --> 01:53:56,770
Just let me know what you want.

2998
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:58,810
I don't want anything, actually.

2999
01:53:59,090 --> 01:54:00,550
I want to sell.

3000
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,710
Ah, let's do business.

3001
01:54:02,250 --> 01:54:02,930
Okay.

3002
01:54:03,790 --> 01:54:08,750
If I, um... What all should I sell?

3003
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:10,650
I have so much stuff.

3004
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:14,640
Okay.

3005
01:54:15,940 --> 01:54:16,700
Chameleon.

3006
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,540
Haggle first.

3007
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:20,960
Oh, do I haggle first?

3008
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:26,280
Oh,

3009
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:31,880
okay.

3010
01:54:32,020 --> 01:54:32,240
Hold on.

3011
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,180
If I... So, should I raise him?

3012
01:54:34,320 --> 01:54:37,060
Like, should I persuade and, like, make him...

3013
01:54:37,060 --> 01:54:38,220
We'll see.

3014
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:39,840
Yeah, we'll see.

3015
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:40,100
Okay.

3016
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:42,080
He really... Nope.

3017
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,520
He really likes...

3018
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:47,060
Really likes a joke.

3019
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:52,280
Oh, this is not... This is unlucky.

3020
01:54:53,960 --> 01:54:54,500
Uh...

3021
01:54:54,500 --> 01:54:55,580
This is unlucky.

3022
01:54:57,740 --> 01:54:58,660
Well done.

3023
01:54:59,080 --> 01:54:59,800
Oh, gosh.

3024
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:00,420
Oh, no.

3025
01:55:00,460 --> 01:55:00,900
Oh, I like that.

3026
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,960
Wait, I think I'm...

3027
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,000
A lot.

3028
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:03,460
Oh, no.

3029
01:55:03,960 --> 01:55:04,500
Oh, no.

3030
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:04,960
Okay.

3031
01:55:06,280 --> 01:55:06,820
Uh...

3032
01:55:06,820 --> 01:55:09,220
That's just... Don't waste your flattery on me.

3033
01:55:09,540 --> 01:55:10,380
Uh... Okay.

3034
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,780
Oh, joke.

3035
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,940
Oh, where'd you get that?

3036
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:16,540
Not now.

3037
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:17,600
Not later.

3038
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:18,580
Not ever.

3039
01:55:18,940 --> 01:55:19,460
Really?

3040
01:55:19,780 --> 01:55:21,340
You're wasting your breath.

3041
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:21,500
Okay.

3042
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:21,960
Okay.

3043
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:22,720
We redeemed.

3044
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:23,440
We redeemed.

3045
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:24,960
We redeemed?

3046
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:25,700
Oh, no.

3047
01:55:26,020 --> 01:55:26,320
Why?

3048
01:55:26,820 --> 01:55:27,840
So unlucky.

3049
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:29,680
Uh...

3050
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:31,080
I guess...

3051
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:31,360
Course?

3052
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:32,460
That's just talk.

3053
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:34,000
Joke?

3054
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:35,580
Oh, where'd you get that?

3055
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:37,100
That's...

3056
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,200
Remarkable.

3057
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:39,220
What nonsense.

3058
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,080
Ugh.

3059
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:44,080
I don't think we got any more...

3060
01:55:46,980 --> 01:55:47,500
Um...

3061
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:49,740
Don't waste your flattery on me.

3062
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:50,140
Oh, no.

3063
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:50,620
Wait.

3064
01:55:51,080 --> 01:55:51,740
Well done.

3065
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:52,460
I messed up.

3066
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:53,720
Is that so?

3067
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:54,820
That's great.

3068
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:56,520
Eh...

3069
01:55:56,520 --> 01:55:57,560
How's it go again?

3070
01:56:02,020 --> 01:56:02,540
Okay.

3071
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:04,180
We went up a little bit.

3072
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,100
We've gone up a little bit.

3073
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:07,120
Oh.

3074
01:56:09,080 --> 01:56:09,900
Okay, here.

3075
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:10,640
Not now.

3076
01:56:10,860 --> 01:56:11,640
Not later.

3077
01:56:12,120 --> 01:56:12,720
Not a...

3078
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:13,740
Remarkable.

3079
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:15,360
Oh, I like that.

3080
01:56:15,540 --> 01:56:16,200
Oh, no.

3081
01:56:17,800 --> 01:56:19,060
That's just talk.

3082
01:56:19,540 --> 01:56:20,960
That's just talk.

3083
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:22,400
Okay.

3084
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:23,960
It is getting better, though.

3085
01:56:24,100 --> 01:56:24,420
Yeah, yeah.

3086
01:56:25,480 --> 01:56:25,920
We'll do that.

3087
01:56:26,180 --> 01:56:26,500
Well done.

3088
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,260
Is that so?

3089
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:31,000
Oh, shoot.

3090
01:56:31,380 --> 01:56:31,800
Never mind.

3091
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:32,620
I messed up again.

3092
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:34,780
Say, that was nonsense.

3093
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:38,460
We're almost to 70.

3094
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:39,040
No!

3095
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,680
I can't do any more.

3096
01:56:44,980 --> 01:56:46,200
I can't do any more.

3097
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:51,880
But he likes me a little bit more.

3098
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:52,560
You're good.

3099
01:56:53,220 --> 01:56:54,160
I'm good.

3100
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:54,560
I'm good.

3101
01:56:54,560 --> 01:56:54,640
Wait.

3102
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:55,580
I might.

3103
01:56:57,140 --> 01:57:01,200
Did you forget a word in between notes in the middle of the sentence?

3104
01:57:02,160 --> 01:57:03,500
There's like a little...

3105
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:06,580
Like a little fluff word you could add in there.

3106
01:57:07,060 --> 01:57:07,400
You know?

3107
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:10,740
You could just add a little something for an extra...

3108
01:57:10,740 --> 01:57:11,640
He's listening.

3109
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:12,340
He's nodding.

3110
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:17,860
I've had about enough of Sir Lazar.

3111
01:57:18,500 --> 01:57:21,440
He thinks he's so much better than everyone else.

3112
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:23,680
Safe line, Vito.

3113
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:25,260
You're pretty good.

3114
01:57:26,140 --> 01:57:27,800
I like Skingrad just fine.

3115
01:57:28,180 --> 01:57:31,060
Folks are a little quiet by Skyrim standards.

3116
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:34,740
But they're friendly and loyal when they get to know you.

3117
01:57:35,260 --> 01:57:35,900
Mm-hmm.

3118
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:37,800
All right.

3119
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,380
Let's burn.

3120
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:40,220
Only quality goods for sale here.

3121
01:57:40,520 --> 01:57:41,860
What can I interest you in?

3122
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:43,120
So now I haggle.

3123
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,880
It didn't change anything.

3124
01:57:46,120 --> 01:57:46,520
Oh!

3125
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,340
Oh!

3126
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:48,320
I see now.

3127
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:49,480
Oh!

3128
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:51,140
Because my disposition is better.

3129
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,800
You think like halfway I could do?

3130
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:57,920
Maybe like...

3131
01:57:57,920 --> 01:58:00,200
75%...

3132
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:01,720
I could do.

3133
01:58:02,940 --> 01:58:03,700
Maybe.

3134
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:06,060
Maybe?

3135
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,220
Try 60%?

3136
01:58:12,840 --> 01:58:13,640
So low.

3137
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:24,650
Did it work?

3138
01:58:28,660 --> 01:58:29,340
Oh, wait.

3139
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,200
Oh, I have to sell the stuff first.

3140
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:31,720
That's right.

3141
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,140
Okay, we'll sell you.

3142
01:58:35,420 --> 01:58:36,680
Wait, can I...

3143
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:38,440
Sell a bunch of things at once?

3144
01:58:39,100 --> 01:58:40,320
Because that would be nice.

3145
01:58:45,800 --> 01:58:46,680
Oh, my God.

3146
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:46,900
Oh, my God.

3147
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:50,900
It worked!

3148
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:52,440
It worked!

3149
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:55,920
I think he likes me.

3150
01:58:57,180 --> 01:58:58,300
Crank it up higher.

3151
01:58:59,740 --> 01:59:00,740
65.

3152
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:07,490
No deal.

3153
01:59:07,950 --> 01:59:08,290
Oh.

3154
01:59:09,130 --> 01:59:09,730
Okay.

3155
01:59:10,570 --> 01:59:11,210
62.

3156
01:59:13,950 --> 01:59:15,970
Make me a better offer.

3157
01:59:16,270 --> 01:59:16,490
Oh.

3158
01:59:17,870 --> 01:59:18,710
Sixty what?

3159
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:26,010
Sixty?

3160
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:34,710
You drive a hard bargain.

3161
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:41,270
Okay.

3162
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:43,670
I will do the sapphire.

3163
01:59:45,070 --> 01:59:46,850
I don't... like I said, I don't know...

3164
01:59:46,850 --> 01:59:47,670
Great deal there.

3165
01:59:49,130 --> 01:59:50,430
Oh, gold nugget.

3166
01:59:51,010 --> 01:59:53,590
I don't know what I need to keep for stuff.

3167
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:56,310
So, I'm just gonna sell a bunch of things.

3168
01:59:56,590 --> 01:59:58,030
A fine transaction.

3169
01:59:58,270 --> 01:59:59,070
Yes, sir.

3170
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:04,150
See, I have 231 arrows.

3171
02:00:05,230 --> 02:00:06,570
Sell the goblin staff.

3172
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:07,730
You don't think I'll need it?

3173
02:00:07,890 --> 02:00:09,210
It is worth a lot of money.

3174
02:00:09,930 --> 02:00:11,210
Folded cloth, I'll sell.

3175
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:13,430
Flower.

3176
02:00:13,610 --> 02:00:14,650
It's not heavy, I'll sell.

3177
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:21,180
VTuber, you are leveling the wrong stats.

3178
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,040
You must level these abilities instead.

3179
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:24,900
Or you are wrong, VTuber.

3180
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:28,880
Oh, okay.

3181
02:00:29,020 --> 02:00:30,460
So, for the petty...

3182
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:32,500
Soul gem...

3183
02:00:33,820 --> 02:00:35,860
Why is this one so cheap?

3184
02:00:36,040 --> 02:00:37,300
And this one's so expensive?

3185
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:48,520
One has a soul in it.

3186
02:00:49,220 --> 02:00:49,820
Oh.

3187
02:00:52,260 --> 02:00:52,860
Oh.

3188
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:53,120
Oh.

3189
02:00:53,420 --> 02:00:53,900
I see.

3190
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,580
I don't see.

3191
02:01:00,270 --> 02:01:01,470
Has it...

3192
02:01:01,470 --> 02:01:02,290
A soul in it.

3193
02:01:02,410 --> 02:01:02,630
Okay.

3194
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:04,030
Let's see.

3195
02:01:04,110 --> 02:01:05,230
We can get rid of...

3196
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:06,150
Sapphire.

3197
02:01:07,550 --> 02:01:08,710
The scales.

3198
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:11,650
You drive a hard bargain.

3199
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:12,430
The goblet.

3200
02:01:12,630 --> 02:01:13,930
That seems a fair price.

3201
02:01:14,250 --> 02:01:14,270
The nuggets.

3202
02:01:14,970 --> 02:01:16,910
A good price for a good...

3203
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:17,570
Yeah.

3204
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:17,990
Var...

3205
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:19,090
Wait.

3206
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:19,890
I didn't read this.

3207
02:01:19,990 --> 02:01:20,830
I think I meant to.

3208
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:24,890
What's the varla stone?

3209
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:26,630
Is that the thing I'm taking?

3210
02:01:30,130 --> 02:01:31,310
Or the statue.

3211
02:01:34,370 --> 02:01:35,330
Bronze amulet.

3212
02:01:35,570 --> 02:01:35,790
I sell.

3213
02:01:38,130 --> 02:01:39,910
Do-do-do-do-do.

3214
02:01:46,690 --> 02:01:47,050
Um...

3215
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:49,110
Recharge is all enchanted weapons.

3216
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,430
Oh!

3217
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:52,050
Do not sell the statue.

3218
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:53,410
Yeah, we got that from the quest.

3219
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:54,370
Or from the dungeon.

3220
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:55,090
I do remember.

3221
02:01:56,090 --> 02:01:56,810
Sell some...

3222
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:58,170
Sell the food, I guess.

3223
02:01:58,390 --> 02:01:59,190
I don't need to eat.

3224
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:00,670
Sell my pants.

3225
02:02:06,330 --> 02:02:06,870
Uh...

3226
02:02:10,730 --> 02:02:13,750
Are these the stones that I got from the...

3227
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:16,410
So I could sell almost all of them, no?

3228
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:18,970
These are the stones that I got...

3229
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:20,510
In the...

3230
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:21,110
Um...

3231
02:02:21,110 --> 02:02:21,690
The dungeon.

3232
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:25,290
I think I was told that I only need like one or something.

3233
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:35,530
So...

3234
02:02:35,530 --> 02:02:35,970
Sell like...

3235
02:02:38,470 --> 02:02:39,990
I'll sell two even.

3236
02:02:40,350 --> 02:02:41,190
Or I'll keep two.

3237
02:02:44,890 --> 02:02:45,690
Oh my gosh!

3238
02:02:45,810 --> 02:02:47,170
We're getting so much money!

3239
02:02:47,730 --> 02:02:51,850
I do have a lot of torches, but they don't weigh anything and they don't sell for anything.

3240
02:02:52,670 --> 02:02:53,150
So...

3241
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:55,310
Nice!

3242
02:02:59,010 --> 02:03:00,730
It's easy to get more of these?

3243
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:01,670
Oh, okay, cool.

3244
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:03,830
Steel short sword.

3245
02:03:03,970 --> 02:03:06,330
I'm gonna keep that just cause I need another weapon.

3246
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:10,950
A rusty iron greaves.

3247
02:03:13,390 --> 02:03:15,410
I should wear those, actually.

3248
02:03:15,970 --> 02:03:17,110
Sell my shirt.

3249
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:18,970
I got my shoes on.

3250
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:21,870
Okay, okay.

3251
02:03:22,290 --> 02:03:23,370
Sell some potato.

3252
02:03:24,310 --> 02:03:25,310
Sell potato.

3253
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:27,390
Um...

3254
02:03:27,390 --> 02:03:29,290
Sell the mutton.

3255
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:33,530
I guess?

3256
02:03:34,050 --> 02:03:34,710
Oh, wait.

3257
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:35,990
I have gold trim shoes.

3258
02:03:36,610 --> 02:03:37,530
Get rid of these shoes.

3259
02:03:37,670 --> 02:03:38,170
They're gross.

3260
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:38,690
Ugly.

3261
02:03:38,890 --> 02:03:39,270
Horrible.

3262
02:03:42,910 --> 02:03:45,150
I think we should be good now.

3263
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:46,930
Got some ale.

3264
02:03:48,690 --> 02:03:50,730
I got rid of most of the...

3265
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:54,490
Whatever stuff.

3266
02:03:56,710 --> 02:03:58,090
Thanks for being cool.

3267
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:00,270
Thanks for being cool.

3268
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:01,710
Ha ha ha ha.

3269
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:07,020
Okie dokie.

3270
02:04:08,640 --> 02:04:10,020
Wait, do I need these?

3271
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:14,560
They only provide two defeds.

3272
02:04:15,180 --> 02:04:16,760
But they're 18 pounds.

3273
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:17,420
They're so heavy.

3274
02:04:18,720 --> 02:04:19,060
No?

3275
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:19,600
Okay.

3276
02:04:19,820 --> 02:04:20,020
Goodbye.

3277
02:04:23,060 --> 02:04:24,100
It's heavy armor.

3278
02:04:24,100 --> 02:04:25,120
I appreciate your business.

3279
02:04:25,320 --> 02:04:25,940
Thank you.

3280
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:27,240
I appreciate too.

3281
02:04:27,240 --> 02:04:27,540
Take care.

3282
02:04:27,980 --> 02:04:28,460
Gander.

3283
02:04:30,240 --> 02:04:30,780
Um...

3284
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:32,000
Alright, let's go back in.

3285
02:04:32,060 --> 02:04:33,380
I'm gonna put on my new shoes.

3286
02:04:35,580 --> 02:04:37,100
I wanna see what they look like.

3287
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:39,400
Oh, my head's in the way.

3288
02:04:40,720 --> 02:04:41,600
Look at that!

3289
02:04:41,980 --> 02:04:43,700
Wait, with no shoes on.

3290
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:46,900
The toes are out.

3291
02:04:48,300 --> 02:04:49,260
There we go.

3292
02:04:49,900 --> 02:04:50,320
Perfect.

3293
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:54,060
Try sorting it by weight and see what's heaviest.

3294
02:04:54,340 --> 02:04:55,620
Oh, I guess so, right?

3295
02:04:58,200 --> 02:04:59,400
The staff...

3296
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:01,800
Isn't any good!

3297
02:05:01,900 --> 02:05:03,880
I don't know if I should keep it or not.

3298
02:05:05,280 --> 02:05:06,480
It's like...

3299
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:08,080
Did bro make ET?

3300
02:05:08,440 --> 02:05:08,780
Yeah!

3301
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:10,680
Meet ETna!

3302
02:05:14,780 --> 02:05:15,920
Ditch the staff.

3303
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:18,000
It's a low-level spell.

3304
02:05:19,580 --> 02:05:21,140
It's a noob weapon!

3305
02:05:21,260 --> 02:05:21,980
Hey, hey, hey!

3306
02:05:22,940 --> 02:05:23,500
Oh!

3307
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:24,280
Sorry.

3308
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:30,810
What can I do for you?

3309
02:05:31,030 --> 02:05:32,310
I would like to sell again.

3310
02:05:34,210 --> 02:05:36,810
Can I interest you in some of my wares?

3311
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:38,250
What do you have?

3312
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:39,750
Blue velvet outfit.

3313
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:41,210
Okay.

3314
02:05:41,730 --> 02:05:43,390
We got the burgundy linens.

3315
02:05:43,390 --> 02:05:45,630
We could get one that's actually, like, you know...

3316
02:05:46,350 --> 02:05:46,990
Clean.

3317
02:05:47,450 --> 02:05:47,850
Probably.

3318
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:53,210
I have an iron bow, too, no?

3319
02:05:53,910 --> 02:05:55,130
Let me make sure.

3320
02:05:56,210 --> 02:05:57,970
I have a steel bow!

3321
02:06:01,050 --> 02:06:02,370
But mine's better.

3322
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:04,670
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh.

3323
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:08,590
I don't need your stinky iron bow.

3324
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:16,090
Okay.

3325
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:18,450
I think we're still at the same, right?

3326
02:06:18,690 --> 02:06:19,130
Haggling?

3327
02:06:19,570 --> 02:06:20,010
Yeah.

3328
02:06:20,290 --> 02:06:21,430
Alright, let's get rid of this.

3329
02:06:23,210 --> 02:06:23,650
Staff.

3330
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:27,380
Okay.

3331
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:28,000
Thank you!

3332
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:29,420
Good day.

3333
02:06:29,420 --> 02:06:29,740
Thank you.

3334
02:06:30,040 --> 02:06:30,600
Good day.

3335
02:06:31,620 --> 02:06:34,280
He's literally that meme of people with blue eyes.

3336
02:06:37,900 --> 02:06:38,400
Woohoo!

3337
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:41,400
You can buy spells that are better than that staff at a guild.

3338
02:06:42,440 --> 02:06:42,940
Okay.

3339
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:43,900
It's 6 PM.

3340
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:46,480
Let's go find...

3341
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,010
Let's see if maybe under the quests...

3342
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:50,220
Oh my gosh, I have so many now.

3343
02:06:52,120 --> 02:06:52,520
Oh...

3344
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:55,880
I met a mysterious...

3345
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:56,360
Yes, yes, yes.

3346
02:06:56,600 --> 02:06:59,800
Who asked me to meet in behind the great chapel at midnight tonight.

3347
02:07:00,880 --> 02:07:01,280
Okay.

3348
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,120
Where is that?

3349
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:06,460
Oh, over here.

3350
02:07:07,080 --> 02:07:07,700
Okay, hold on.

3351
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,880
Okay.

3352
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:15,580
I wanna make sure I know where we're going before I just wait, you know?

3353
02:07:20,230 --> 02:07:20,810
Good evening.

3354
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:21,790
Good evening.

3355
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:27,760
I guess here?

3356
02:07:29,460 --> 02:07:30,840
Is behind the chapel?

3357
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:31,920
It seems.

3358
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:33,060
Check your map.

3359
02:07:33,260 --> 02:07:33,400
True.

3360
02:07:36,280 --> 02:07:37,480
The great chapel!

3361
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:40,380
Yes, sir.

3362
02:07:43,300 --> 02:07:44,340
Let's go in.

3363
02:07:45,080 --> 02:07:46,920
I actually dropped a mixtape on YouTube.

3364
02:07:47,620 --> 02:07:48,080
Glarthir?

3365
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:49,400
Glarthir?

3366
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:51,200
What's new with you?

3367
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:54,560
I ran into some goblins in the woods not long ago.

3368
02:07:55,220 --> 02:07:56,740
Nasty little beasts.

3369
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,140
Goblins?

3370
02:07:58,640 --> 02:07:58,840
Ugh.

3371
02:07:59,560 --> 02:08:02,220
Evil, foul-smelling little brutes.

3372
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:03,520
Farewell.

3373
02:08:04,020 --> 02:08:05,140
Greetings, Bosma.

3374
02:08:10,540 --> 02:08:11,920
You're saying this...

3375
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:13,820
At the altar?

3376
02:08:14,720 --> 02:08:15,480
Rejoice!

3377
02:08:15,640 --> 02:08:17,320
Through faith your afflictions are banished!

3378
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:17,720
Ah!

3379
02:08:19,580 --> 02:08:20,980
Not for long, though.

3380
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:24,680
I'm about to join the guild of the Brotherhood.

3381
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:25,500
Good to see you.

3382
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:28,800
Atahorn Castle, New Floral is besieged by marauders.

3383
02:08:29,140 --> 02:08:30,940
I wish I could go and save them.

3384
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:32,040
Go on.

3385
02:08:32,180 --> 02:08:34,280
We are all talking about the Emperor's murder.

3386
02:08:34,640 --> 02:08:37,060
We have no Emperor and no heir.

3387
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:39,180
That's never happened before.

3388
02:08:40,160 --> 02:08:41,320
We do have an heir.

3389
02:08:41,320 --> 02:08:42,560
We should all be worried.

3390
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:44,900
I just don't think about it.

3391
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:45,620
I just don't think about it.

3392
02:08:45,620 --> 02:08:47,480
The Elder Council will take care of things.

3393
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:49,220
Sooner or later.

3394
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:50,800
So I've heard.

3395
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:52,140
I just don't think about it.

3396
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:54,440
Yeah, Glarthor.

3397
02:08:54,580 --> 02:08:54,980
Don't you think?

3398
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:56,100
Of course.

3399
02:08:56,480 --> 02:08:58,960
What's the news from the other parts of Tamriel?

3400
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:04,660
I understand Daedra worship has become increasingly prevalent in the Somerset Isle.

3401
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:09,760
It seems Somerset Isle has become a much more dangerous place.

3402
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:11,600
Take care.

3403
02:09:12,180 --> 02:09:12,660
Good day.

3404
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:13,360
Take care.

3405
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:13,600
Hello there.

3406
02:09:14,680 --> 02:09:15,240
Well met.

3407
02:09:15,760 --> 02:09:17,060
Dandelion, happy birthday!

3408
02:09:17,780 --> 02:09:20,100
Can you tell me your favorite thing about my Kamiyoshi?

3409
02:09:20,300 --> 02:09:21,140
Her name is...

3410
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:22,860
Mint Phantom.

3411
02:09:25,460 --> 02:09:26,060
Um...

3412
02:09:26,720 --> 02:09:27,020
Um...

3413
02:09:27,020 --> 02:09:28,740
I like when she does this.

3414
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,120
Happy birthday Dandelion!

3415
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:38,100
I'm sorry I missed it yesterday!

3416
02:09:40,920 --> 02:09:42,180
What's this about?

3417
02:09:42,380 --> 02:09:43,340
What are you about?

3418
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:45,260
Oh no.

3419
02:09:45,660 --> 02:09:46,120
I don't...

3420
02:09:46,120 --> 02:09:47,460
This is not a restroom, sir.

3421
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:53,740
I like that too.

3422
02:09:55,860 --> 02:09:57,180
It must be a lonely existence.

3423
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:00,280
Okay, bye.

3424
02:10:01,780 --> 02:10:04,140
Alright, let's go over here.

3425
02:10:05,460 --> 02:10:07,260
How fast has time passed?

3426
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:07,860
Let's wait.

3427
02:10:08,460 --> 02:10:10,500
One hour, eight, nine...

3428
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:12,200
Ten...

3429
02:10:13,420 --> 02:10:13,980
Eleven...

3430
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:15,980
Let's wait until eleven.

3431
02:10:16,540 --> 02:10:17,800
You're doing great, boss.

3432
02:10:18,180 --> 02:10:19,780
Thanks, Cinderethylos!

3433
02:10:19,820 --> 02:10:20,280
Thank you!

3434
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:24,000
Okay.

3435
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:25,600
We're waiting.

3436
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:33,760
How fast...

3437
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:34,360
Wait.

3438
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:36,760
Ah, you came!

3439
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:38,620
You're sure you weren't followed?

3440
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:39,420
I don't think so.

3441
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:40,860
I thought I could trust you.

3442
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:42,160
Nobody else in town.

3443
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:43,940
They're all in on it.

3444
02:10:44,320 --> 02:10:45,680
All watching me.

3445
02:10:46,260 --> 02:10:47,420
Well, yes.

3446
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:49,680
I need you to do something for me.

3447
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:50,000
Okay.

3448
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:51,160
I'll pay you...

3449
02:10:51,700 --> 02:10:52,140
Gold.

3450
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,740
You like gold, don't you?

3451
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:55,080
Aha.

3452
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:55,580
Aha.

3453
02:10:56,580 --> 02:10:57,220
Aha.

3454
02:10:57,480 --> 02:10:57,620
Aha.

3455
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:57,860
Aha.

3456
02:10:58,320 --> 02:10:58,440
Aha.

3457
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:04,740
Ooh.

3458
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,540
He knows too much.

3459
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:13,560
I need you to check out some people for me.

3460
02:11:13,720 --> 02:11:15,560
The ones who are following me.

3461
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:16,460
Watch them.

3462
02:11:16,840 --> 02:11:17,500
See where they go.

3463
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:18,540
Who they report to.

3464
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:19,860
Will you help me?

3465
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:21,360
Yeah?

3466
02:11:22,100 --> 02:11:22,760
Very good.

3467
02:11:23,120 --> 02:11:24,140
You won't be sorry.

3468
02:11:24,140 --> 02:11:24,720
For the gold?

3469
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:25,700
I'll pay you well.

3470
02:11:26,140 --> 02:11:27,580
Did I say that already?

3471
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:30,320
Let's start with Bernadette Penelis.

3472
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,140
Be outside my house at 6am.

3473
02:11:33,380 --> 02:11:34,700
You'll see her watching me.

3474
02:11:34,980 --> 02:11:37,700
See where she goes and who she reports to.

3475
02:11:38,200 --> 02:11:41,180
We'll meet here again tomorrow night.

3476
02:11:41,180 --> 02:11:41,580
Again.

3477
02:11:42,080 --> 02:11:45,260
Oh, and never contact me in public.

3478
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:46,440
They're watching.

3479
02:11:46,480 --> 02:11:46,820
Never.

3480
02:11:47,100 --> 02:11:48,580
They can't know you're helping me.

3481
02:11:48,920 --> 02:11:50,760
You sure whisper loud.

3482
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:54,260
Her house is almost directly across the street from mine.

3483
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,960
Southwest of the Great Chapel.

3484
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,420
Coincidence?

3485
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:59,280
I don't think so.

3486
02:12:00,220 --> 02:12:02,040
Well, where is your house actually?

3487
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,120
There's so much I could tell you.

3488
02:12:04,360 --> 02:12:05,500
So many secrets.

3489
02:12:05,880 --> 02:12:08,500
But then you'd be in danger too.

3490
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:09,860
Then I'd have to kill you.

3491
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:12,620
It's best if we're not seen talking.

3492
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:14,300
Hi.

3493
02:12:15,340 --> 02:12:16,680
For you, of course.

3494
02:12:17,020 --> 02:12:18,620
Oh, he likes me.

3495
02:12:19,800 --> 02:12:20,340
Alright.

3496
02:12:20,640 --> 02:12:21,980
Guys, I gotta actually...

3497
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:23,740
Remember, Bernadette Penelis.

3498
02:12:24,180 --> 02:12:24,720
6am.

3499
02:12:24,820 --> 02:12:25,680
Bernadette Penelis.

3500
02:12:25,700 --> 02:12:26,300
Don't let us see you watching.

3501
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:28,580
I gotta use a little ghosties room, but...

3502
02:12:28,580 --> 02:12:30,840
We gotta talk to Bernadette.

3503
02:12:31,100 --> 02:12:32,100
Wait, it's not even midnight.

3504
02:12:32,100 --> 02:12:32,280
Midnight.

3505
02:12:33,540 --> 02:12:35,040
It's not midnight, mister.

3506
02:12:36,620 --> 02:12:37,680
Whatever, I guess.

3507
02:12:40,200 --> 02:12:40,780
Um...

3508
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:41,820
Bernadette.

3509
02:12:42,820 --> 02:12:43,400
Bernadette.

3510
02:12:44,120 --> 02:12:45,940
Wait, I guess we can look at the map, huh?

3511
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:49,380
Go to the ghosties room.

3512
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:49,920
I'm going!

3513
02:12:50,360 --> 02:12:51,260
Give me a second.

3514
02:12:51,720 --> 02:12:54,220
It said it was like...

3515
02:12:55,180 --> 02:12:55,760
Ah!

3516
02:12:56,860 --> 02:12:57,440
Ah!

3517
02:12:57,740 --> 02:12:58,140
Okay.

3518
02:12:58,460 --> 02:12:59,840
Alright, I'll be right back.

3519
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,500
I gotta pee.

3520
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:04,960
I gotta pee.

3521
02:13:05,100 --> 02:13:05,760
I'll be right back.

3522
02:13:05,840 --> 02:13:07,640
I'll be right back.

3523
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:09,980
Wait, I'll do his funny face.

3524
02:16:51,650 --> 02:16:52,510
Oh, sorry.

3525
02:16:52,730 --> 02:16:53,470
Forgot to unmute.

3526
02:16:53,790 --> 02:16:54,490
I'm back!

3527
02:16:56,270 --> 02:16:57,190
I'm back!

3528
02:16:57,550 --> 02:16:58,130
I'm back!

3529
02:16:58,330 --> 02:16:58,850
I'm back!

3530
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:00,390
Sorry.

3531
02:17:00,730 --> 02:17:01,210
For the wait.

3532
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:03,050
Thank you for waiting.

3533
02:17:05,930 --> 02:17:07,490
Thank you.

3534
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:12,730
Yes.

3535
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:17,010
I got more tea.

3536
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:19,890
Yes, I did.

3537
02:17:20,090 --> 02:17:21,390
And maybe a little snack.

3538
02:17:23,810 --> 02:17:24,530
Let's see.

3539
02:17:27,010 --> 02:17:28,350
She's right here?

3540
02:17:29,770 --> 02:17:30,290
Here?

3541
02:17:31,830 --> 02:17:33,530
Okay, now I'm just gonna...

3542
02:17:33,530 --> 02:17:34,230
Wait, who are you?

3543
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:36,610
I need to see Chibi Minto again.

3544
02:17:36,970 --> 02:17:37,130
Oh!

3545
02:17:37,370 --> 02:17:37,730
Oh, sorry.

3546
02:17:39,810 --> 02:17:41,690
Why are you doing that at midnight?

3547
02:17:43,070 --> 02:17:44,750
People, everybody's trying to sleep!

3548
02:17:45,810 --> 02:17:48,490
Can I share a secret that makes lockpicking easier?

3549
02:17:48,490 --> 02:17:49,630
I only learned recently.

3550
02:17:50,190 --> 02:17:52,070
Wanted to ask first to not backseat.

3551
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:53,950
You know what?

3552
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:54,390
Go ahead.

3553
02:17:54,390 --> 02:17:55,450
Oh yeah.

3554
02:17:55,690 --> 02:17:56,250
Wake up!

3555
02:17:56,370 --> 02:17:56,830
It's midnight!

3556
02:18:04,500 --> 02:18:06,900
Actually though, I did watch a video on lockpicking.

3557
02:18:07,020 --> 02:18:08,440
I just probably need to watch it again.

3558
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:10,620
Oh.

3559
02:18:11,540 --> 02:18:12,420
I'm trapped.

3560
02:18:13,320 --> 02:18:14,720
But I can't go in there anyway.

3561
02:18:18,120 --> 02:18:20,320
So let's wait for a couple of hours.

3562
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:21,780
And then...

3563
02:18:22,280 --> 02:18:24,080
Golly, we're doing a lot of waiting, huh?

3564
02:18:24,880 --> 02:18:26,120
Wait five hours.

3565
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:26,480
Okay.

3566
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:32,780
Oh, the beautiful sunrise.

3567
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:33,100
Oh!

3568
02:18:33,320 --> 02:18:33,700
Hi!

3569
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:37,420
He's like, why have you been standing here all these hours?

3570
02:18:40,930 --> 02:18:42,270
Don't stare at me!

3571
02:18:42,370 --> 02:18:44,810
You're gonna make it so obvious, Glarther!

3572
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:47,310
Gosh!

3573
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:48,610
Stupid!

3574
02:18:52,290 --> 02:18:54,810
He's like, don't interact with me.

3575
02:18:55,770 --> 02:18:57,010
Then he just...

3576
02:18:57,510 --> 02:18:58,330
stares at me.

3577
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:00,970
Um...

3578
02:19:01,490 --> 02:19:01,830
So...

3579
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:03,350
Wait, why is it 1am?

3580
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:05,650
Wait, what do you mean?

3581
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:06,870
Did I get...

3582
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:08,710
Did I get interrupted by that guy?

3583
02:19:09,290 --> 02:19:12,630
A little bird told me that you've been asking around town about Glarther.

3584
02:19:12,910 --> 02:19:14,530
A resident eccentric.

3585
02:19:15,430 --> 02:19:16,570
I'd like to know why.

3586
02:19:19,550 --> 02:19:20,230
Uh...

3587
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:20,630
Dion?

3588
02:19:21,910 --> 02:19:22,590
Um...

3589
02:19:22,590 --> 02:19:23,250
Uh...

3590
02:19:23,250 --> 02:19:24,750
I'm just curious about him.

3591
02:19:25,170 --> 02:19:25,490
Fine.

3592
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:26,650
Play it that way.

3593
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:29,490
Let me give you some friendly advice.

3594
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:31,910
Glarther is crazy.

3595
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:33,490
Maybe harmless crazy.

3596
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:34,850
Maybe not.

3597
02:19:35,650 --> 02:19:37,310
I think Glarther can match my freak.

3598
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:38,730
If he asks you to do anything...

3599
02:19:39,770 --> 02:19:40,250
strange...

3600
02:19:40,250 --> 02:19:42,270
You come see me first.

3601
02:19:42,510 --> 02:19:42,970
Got it?

3602
02:19:43,170 --> 02:19:44,770
Or any of the town guard.

3603
02:19:44,970 --> 02:19:46,430
Let us handle it.

3604
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:50,900
What?

3605
02:19:55,410 --> 02:19:55,890
Um...

3606
02:19:55,890 --> 02:19:57,930
I'm gonna keep doing what I was supposed to do?

3607
02:19:59,230 --> 02:20:03,070
Do you know when the plushies got on the second wave of the first day?

3608
02:20:03,290 --> 02:20:04,410
And the mugs are shipping.

3609
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:07,930
I'm worried I might have to move places before getting them.

3610
02:20:07,930 --> 02:20:08,250
Um...

3611
02:20:08,250 --> 02:20:09,010
The plushies?

3612
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:10,950
Like you got the first round of plushies?

3613
02:20:11,950 --> 02:20:13,930
Because if you got the first round...

3614
02:20:14,910 --> 02:20:17,410
And not like the...

3615
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:19,050
The second one?

3616
02:20:19,330 --> 02:20:19,770
Um...

3617
02:20:19,770 --> 02:20:20,490
I would message...

3618
02:20:20,490 --> 02:20:22,010
I would email...

3619
02:20:23,010 --> 02:20:23,570
Um...

3620
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:24,030
Uh...

3621
02:20:24,030 --> 02:20:24,530
Support.

3622
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:25,870
Moso box support.

3623
02:20:26,510 --> 02:20:26,870
And then...

3624
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:28,770
The mugs should be shipping out soon.

3625
02:20:29,070 --> 02:20:31,010
But I can contact them again too.

3626
02:20:31,330 --> 02:20:32,650
Because they told me...

3627
02:20:33,290 --> 02:20:34,130
What the hell?

3628
02:20:35,730 --> 02:20:38,570
You don't need to ring at every hour of night!

3629
02:20:39,850 --> 02:20:40,790
It's 2am.

3630
02:20:43,670 --> 02:20:45,250
Sounds like they got the second round.

3631
02:20:45,370 --> 02:20:47,170
If it's the second round, then it was gonna be...

3632
02:20:47,170 --> 02:20:48,930
I think shipped around...

3633
02:20:48,930 --> 02:20:50,530
June or so.

3634
02:20:58,080 --> 02:21:00,620
You tap the pin repeatedly until the pin...

3635
02:21:00,620 --> 02:21:02,220
Moves a lot slower than usual.

3636
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:02,640
So...

3637
02:21:02,640 --> 02:21:04,960
And that's when you want to try and set the Tumblr.

3638
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:05,880
Yeah!

3639
02:21:06,300 --> 02:21:06,580
Yeah, yeah.

3640
02:21:06,580 --> 02:21:07,880
That's I think what the video...

3641
02:21:07,880 --> 02:21:09,060
That I watched said too.

3642
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:12,160
But yeah.

3643
02:21:12,180 --> 02:21:13,320
If you're worried about moving...

3644
02:21:13,960 --> 02:21:15,220
Just send an email to...

3645
02:21:16,220 --> 02:21:16,660
Um...

3646
02:21:17,380 --> 02:21:17,820
Uh...

3647
02:21:18,280 --> 02:21:19,100
Oh gosh.

3648
02:21:19,220 --> 02:21:20,700
I forgot the support...

3649
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:21,980
One for my store.

3650
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,580
But for Moso box...

3651
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:25,960
I'm sure they have it in there...

3652
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:26,440
On their Twitter.

3653
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:30,620
I can get it.

3654
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:31,660
Oh, hello.

3655
02:21:32,220 --> 02:21:32,380
Oh my gosh.

3656
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:33,480
You're making it so...

3657
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:34,720
Glarther, go home!

3658
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:38,220
Oh.

3659
02:21:38,960 --> 02:21:39,740
He listened to me.

3660
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:42,620
Sexy...

3661
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:44,300
Made ghost VTuber woman.

3662
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:44,580
Oh.

3663
02:21:44,920 --> 02:21:45,580
Thank you.

3664
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:49,340
What time is it?

3665
02:21:49,560 --> 02:21:50,700
Let's wait...

3666
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:51,600
Uh...

3667
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,560
Three more hours.

3668
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:57,280
Alright, finally.

3669
02:21:57,420 --> 02:21:58,160
We're not interrupted.

3670
02:22:00,480 --> 02:22:01,240
Ah...

3671
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:02,100
Good morning!

3672
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:04,320
What is this place called?

3673
02:22:05,220 --> 02:22:06,440
Scum guard.

3674
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:07,860
Skin...

3675
02:22:07,860 --> 02:22:10,580
I'm not talking to you!

3676
02:22:14,740 --> 02:22:16,020
Leave, Glarther!

3677
02:22:16,180 --> 02:22:17,540
She's about to come out any second.

3678
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:18,640
God.

3679
02:22:19,980 --> 02:22:21,200
Skin town.

3680
02:22:22,640 --> 02:22:25,340
Here, I'm gonna hide right here and see what she does.

3681
02:22:26,340 --> 02:22:26,900
Alright.

3682
02:22:27,540 --> 02:22:27,940
Okay.

3683
02:22:28,120 --> 02:22:28,880
She's coming out soon.

3684
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:29,540
6 AM.

3685
02:22:30,240 --> 02:22:31,200
6 AM!

3686
02:22:43,970 --> 02:22:45,410
Okay, any second now?

3687
02:22:47,350 --> 02:22:47,910
Any...

3688
02:22:47,910 --> 02:22:48,670
Oh, oh, oh gosh!

3689
02:22:49,110 --> 02:22:49,930
It's 6.

3690
02:22:49,930 --> 02:22:50,010
Thanks.

3691
02:22:57,500 --> 02:22:58,140
Sorry.

3692
02:23:01,300 --> 02:23:01,940
Um...

3693
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:07,840
Uh...

3694
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:11,580
Huh?

3695
02:23:12,540 --> 02:23:14,400
Is she doing the stalking mission?

3696
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:16,200
Uh, I think so.

3697
02:23:16,420 --> 02:23:17,380
I'm supposed to be.

3698
02:23:22,630 --> 02:23:23,290
There she is.

3699
02:23:24,730 --> 02:23:25,550
I think.

3700
02:23:28,210 --> 02:23:30,130
She doesn't even look at you her way.

3701
02:23:33,350 --> 02:23:34,550
Oh, hello.

3702
02:23:35,150 --> 02:23:36,210
Oh, hi.

3703
02:23:36,850 --> 02:23:37,130
Can I...

3704
02:23:37,130 --> 02:23:38,490
Do I talk to her or...

3705
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:41,250
Or do I follow her?

3706
02:23:47,010 --> 02:23:47,530
Okay.

3707
02:23:47,530 --> 02:23:47,610
Bye.

3708
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:55,990
She goes to church and she prays.

3709
02:23:56,030 --> 02:23:56,550
I'll sit next to her.

3710
02:23:58,050 --> 02:23:59,630
I'm Bernadette Penelis.

3711
02:23:59,770 --> 02:24:00,810
I work for Tamika.

3712
02:24:01,050 --> 02:24:02,670
I grow grapes for her wines.

3713
02:24:02,930 --> 02:24:03,370
Hahaha.

3714
02:24:05,070 --> 02:24:06,350
Where are you looking, Bernadette?

3715
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:08,990
Uh...

3716
02:24:08,990 --> 02:24:10,710
I've lived here all my life.

3717
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:11,690
Grown grapes.

3718
02:24:11,930 --> 02:24:13,050
It's all I know.

3719
02:24:13,690 --> 02:24:16,650
Fresh air, mountains, the grapes on the vine.

3720
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:18,330
It's just...

3721
02:24:18,330 --> 02:24:18,890
Beautiful.

3722
02:24:20,390 --> 02:24:22,710
I don't think she cares at all about this guy.

3723
02:24:23,210 --> 02:24:23,610
Farewell.

3724
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:29,740
Wow, if you joined the, uh...

3725
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:33,220
The Mages Guild, your outfit would be as clean as mine.

3726
02:24:34,460 --> 02:24:35,280
Just saying.

3727
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:36,260
Hail.

3728
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:40,100
No, it's sunny today.

3729
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:42,480
Uh...

3730
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:45,600
Arahorn Castle near Coral is besieged by Marauders.

3731
02:24:45,900 --> 02:24:47,700
I wish I could go and save them.

3732
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:49,000
I hear you.

3733
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:50,100
Is she gonna...

3734
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:50,700
Who the heck is that?

3735
02:24:52,560 --> 02:24:54,240
Wait, who is this guy?

3736
02:24:54,540 --> 02:24:55,500
Good thing he's cautious.

3737
02:24:55,900 --> 02:24:57,980
I'd hate to have something go wrong.

3738
02:24:58,400 --> 02:24:59,260
I am Ambrose Cannes.

3739
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:01,220
Grape grower for Cirilli Brothers.

3740
02:25:01,560 --> 02:25:04,640
I'm also an advanced trainer for weapon and shield parries.

3741
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:07,340
Shield parries.

3742
02:25:07,780 --> 02:25:07,920
Whoa.

3743
02:25:09,540 --> 02:25:10,880
Be seeing you.

3744
02:25:13,080 --> 02:25:14,700
I don't think she's gonna do anything.

3745
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:15,460
Can I sit here?

3746
02:25:16,140 --> 02:25:16,520
No.

3747
02:25:18,300 --> 02:25:20,040
Are they all great people?

3748
02:25:20,240 --> 02:25:21,340
I think so.

3749
02:25:25,780 --> 02:25:26,360
Talos.

3750
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,340
Zenithar.

3751
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:34,580
Mara.

3752
02:25:36,720 --> 02:25:37,520
Uh...

3753
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:37,900
Uh...

3754
02:25:37,900 --> 02:25:38,660
Chimeras?

3755
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:40,340
Ooh.

3756
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:44,280
She's leaving.

3757
02:25:44,780 --> 02:25:45,140
Hail.

3758
02:25:46,560 --> 02:25:47,660
How are you?

3759
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:48,280
Hello.

3760
02:25:50,300 --> 02:25:51,800
I'm stalking her.

3761
02:25:52,580 --> 02:25:53,180
Leaf.

3762
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:54,440
Oh, my bad.

3763
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:57,060
I punched the door.

3764
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:58,600
Oh, no.

3765
02:25:58,820 --> 02:26:00,360
E-Tina doesn't know how doorknobs work.

3766
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:02,620
I put my fist away.

3767
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:05,340
Thank you for Super Chat.

3768
02:26:11,180 --> 02:26:11,680
Errm.

3769
02:26:11,820 --> 02:26:12,600
No time to talk.

3770
02:26:12,940 --> 02:26:13,300
Errm.

3771
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:15,000
My children are starving.

3772
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:16,360
Please help.

3773
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:21,120
Can't you see that I'm very busy?

3774
02:26:21,300 --> 02:26:22,440
Clarthur, you're very rude.

3775
02:26:22,540 --> 02:26:23,220
That's what you are.

3776
02:26:25,020 --> 02:26:25,520
Oh.

3777
02:26:26,080 --> 02:26:26,580
Gosh.

3778
02:26:26,580 --> 02:26:27,520
Well met.

3779
02:26:27,700 --> 02:26:28,800
Well met.

3780
02:26:28,860 --> 02:26:29,620
Damn, Tamika.

3781
02:26:32,720 --> 02:26:34,160
Clarthur, do you have children?

3782
02:26:34,580 --> 02:26:35,820
I don't believe him.

3783
02:26:43,340 --> 02:26:45,100
I'm just following her all day.

3784
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:46,720
Ugh.

3785
02:26:49,460 --> 02:26:49,980
Hmm.

3786
02:26:50,420 --> 02:26:50,580
Hmm.

3787
02:26:50,840 --> 02:26:51,320
Hmm.

3788
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:53,040
No kids in Oblivion.

3789
02:26:53,160 --> 02:26:53,700
Wait, are there...

3790
02:26:53,700 --> 02:26:56,560
Actually, now that you mention it, I don't think I've seen a single one.

3791
02:26:57,660 --> 02:26:58,780
Good to see you.

3792
02:26:59,720 --> 02:27:00,600
How do you do?

3793
02:27:01,100 --> 02:27:01,500
Really?

3794
02:27:02,020 --> 02:27:03,120
It's good to see me?

3795
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:04,980
Uh-oh, we lost her.

3796
02:27:05,220 --> 02:27:05,700
Oh, never mind.

3797
02:27:10,610 --> 02:27:11,550
Kids are bad.

3798
02:27:12,810 --> 02:27:14,590
Is it because you could kill the children?

3799
02:27:19,700 --> 02:27:22,480
And they're like, nah, we don't want you to do that.

3800
02:27:22,480 --> 02:27:22,560
What?

3801
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:25,240
Why are you walking like that?

3802
02:27:25,300 --> 02:27:26,660
I'm just trying to follow her.

3803
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:31,840
Oh, that's not my horse.

3804
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:34,340
Oh wait, this is where the vineyard is.

3805
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:36,240
Wait, this guy...

3806
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:36,480
Morning.

3807
02:27:36,640 --> 02:27:38,940
Oh my gosh, I thought you were an executioner, mister.

3808
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:42,420
You scared me.

3809
02:27:45,500 --> 02:27:46,020
Oh.

3810
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:47,100
Hello.

3811
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:48,840
Hi.

3812
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:50,720
I'm also looking at the vineyards.

3813
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:52,160
I haven't been to this area before.

3814
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:54,380
We'll watch her from afar.

3815
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:56,880
Wait, who is she...

3816
02:27:56,880 --> 02:27:58,280
She's walking with that guy.

3817
02:27:59,820 --> 02:28:00,860
How suspicious.

3818
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:03,160
Hello, David?

3819
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:06,720
There was one guy...

3820
02:28:06,720 --> 02:28:08,140
Oh gosh, I can't remember the name.

3821
02:28:08,440 --> 02:28:09,660
But they said he did the...

3822
02:28:10,560 --> 02:28:11,480
The vineyards.

3823
02:28:11,480 --> 02:28:13,140
I've harvested some grapes.

3824
02:28:13,740 --> 02:28:16,520
He did the vineyards and he was the archer.

3825
02:28:19,260 --> 02:28:20,440
Talos the mighty.

3826
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:21,780
Talos the unerring.

3827
02:28:22,140 --> 02:28:23,480
Talos the unassailable.

3828
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:25,360
I...

3829
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:26,040
Talos...

3830
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:28,040
Oh my gosh, she's just working here.

3831
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:29,940
She really is a vineyard lady.

3832
02:28:32,200 --> 02:28:33,000
Was it Shamir?

3833
02:28:35,880 --> 02:28:36,740
Grape thief!

3834
02:28:37,540 --> 02:28:39,460
Would they actually get upset at me?

3835
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,040
It's not...

3836
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:41,640
It's not red.

3837
02:28:45,200 --> 02:28:46,580
I took your grapes.

3838
02:28:47,340 --> 02:28:49,040
I'm a fair-handed grapes and bows.

3839
02:28:49,380 --> 02:28:49,800
Yeah!

3840
02:28:50,140 --> 02:28:50,980
I'm a grower and trainer.

3841
02:28:51,160 --> 02:28:53,880
But I suspect you want to shoot, not grow grapes.

3842
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:54,600
Am I right?

3843
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:55,540
I want to shoot!

3844
02:28:56,100 --> 02:28:57,020
Yeah, I want to shoot.

3845
02:28:58,300 --> 02:28:59,680
You've got a lot to learn.

3846
02:29:02,140 --> 02:29:04,940
This person cannot help you train any higher.

3847
02:29:07,260 --> 02:29:07,920
What?

3848
02:29:12,290 --> 02:29:13,450
What do you mean?

3849
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:15,170
I'm an apprentice.

3850
02:29:16,830 --> 02:29:18,930
You are also an apprentice?

3851
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:24,630
He's not any better than me.

3852
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:26,330
Why was everyone...

3853
02:29:26,330 --> 02:29:29,730
Why was everyone like making him seem like he's the best?

3854
02:29:29,730 --> 02:29:32,590
Yuros is a good shepherd, but his real love is cheese.

3855
02:29:33,010 --> 02:29:35,410
Of course, there's no money in herding cheese.

3856
02:29:39,410 --> 02:29:40,430
Riemann Broder.

3857
02:29:40,670 --> 02:29:42,430
He works Surly's Vineyard.

3858
02:29:42,750 --> 02:29:44,410
I work Tamika's Vineyard.

3859
02:29:44,950 --> 02:29:46,950
Riemann spent 20 years in the Legion.

3860
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:49,310
And he's an advanced marksman trainer.

3861
02:29:50,730 --> 02:29:51,130
You too.

3862
02:29:51,130 --> 02:29:51,710
So, Legion.

3863
02:29:51,910 --> 02:29:52,370
You too.

3864
02:29:52,370 --> 02:29:52,390
Wait.

3865
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:53,150
Or what was his name?

3866
02:29:53,350 --> 02:29:53,730
Oh!

3867
02:29:53,790 --> 02:29:54,210
Oh no!

3868
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:55,010
I lost her!

3869
02:29:55,110 --> 02:29:55,630
Oh, just kidding.

3870
02:29:57,330 --> 02:29:57,730
Wait.

3871
02:29:57,890 --> 02:29:59,670
So, who should I...

3872
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:00,630
Wowie!

3873
02:30:00,810 --> 02:30:01,110
One year!

3874
02:30:01,270 --> 02:30:01,670
Alan!

3875
02:30:01,850 --> 02:30:02,370
Thank you!

3876
02:30:02,890 --> 02:30:03,290
Riemann.

3877
02:30:04,030 --> 02:30:04,430
Riemann.

3878
02:30:06,010 --> 02:30:06,410
Riemann.

3879
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:11,270
Where's Riemann at though?

3880
02:30:11,890 --> 02:30:13,090
I talked to him before.

3881
02:30:13,290 --> 02:30:13,450
Oh!

3882
02:30:16,430 --> 02:30:16,990
Oh yeah!

3883
02:30:17,110 --> 02:30:19,290
That guy said that he won't train anybody anymore.

3884
02:30:19,290 --> 02:30:21,970
I did sleep in his bed.

3885
02:30:22,070 --> 02:30:22,570
You're right!

3886
02:30:25,710 --> 02:30:27,390
I slept in his bed!

3887
02:30:28,230 --> 02:30:28,810
Wow!

3888
02:30:29,130 --> 02:30:29,430
Whoa!

3889
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:31,210
I want to smash in the...

3890
02:30:31,210 --> 02:30:31,530
Oh!

3891
02:30:31,670 --> 02:30:32,850
Oh my god!

3892
02:30:33,610 --> 02:30:34,630
Oh wow!

3893
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:40,870
Guys, have you ever heard about the spiders that are in the cranberry pools though?

3894
02:30:40,870 --> 02:30:43,270
I used to always want to be a cranberry...

3895
02:30:43,270 --> 02:30:44,250
Like...

3896
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:45,350
Smasher...

3897
02:30:46,530 --> 02:30:48,270
Not Cranberry Smasher.

3898
02:30:48,270 --> 02:30:48,650
But...

3899
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:49,670
But you know how like...

3900
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:52,470
You can go into the pools with the cranberries and harvest them?

3901
02:30:52,870 --> 02:30:55,430
But there's spiders all in there!

3902
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:56,510
Like...

3903
02:30:58,670 --> 02:30:59,270
Like...

3904
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:04,370
You get covered in spiders!

3905
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:04,910
Yeah!

3906
02:31:07,830 --> 02:31:10,390
I'm afraid that this quest is boring.

3907
02:31:16,830 --> 02:31:17,990
I hate this.

3908
02:31:18,050 --> 02:31:19,110
Why would you say this?

3909
02:31:19,430 --> 02:31:21,550
Well I was thinking about mashing...

3910
02:31:21,550 --> 02:31:23,390
Mashing grapes with my feet.

3911
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:26,210
And then I was just like...

3912
02:31:26,210 --> 02:31:27,370
Oh, I always wanted to do that.

3913
02:31:27,770 --> 02:31:29,230
But not with the cranberries.

3914
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:29,890
Because...

3915
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:31,070
This is so inefficient.

3916
02:31:31,350 --> 02:31:33,030
All our sheep are gonna leave.

3917
02:31:36,550 --> 02:31:37,030
But...

3918
02:31:37,030 --> 02:31:37,810
Now...

3919
02:31:37,810 --> 02:31:39,090
Because of...

3920
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:40,450
You know...

3921
02:31:43,810 --> 02:31:44,770
The spiders...

3922
02:31:44,770 --> 02:31:45,990
Definitely not with cranberries.

3923
02:31:46,170 --> 02:31:46,890
I don't want to touch that.

3924
02:31:54,270 --> 02:31:57,590
Someone had to slip some cash money in one of these.

3925
02:32:02,230 --> 02:32:02,710
Someone...

3926
02:32:02,710 --> 02:32:03,210
Somewhere...

3927
02:32:03,210 --> 02:32:03,310
Oh!

3928
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:03,850
Lockpick!

3929
02:32:03,850 --> 02:32:04,390
I'll take that.

3930
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:13,260
Lady is still there.

3931
02:32:14,080 --> 02:32:15,040
What should I do?

3932
02:32:15,160 --> 02:32:16,520
Just wait until midnight again?

3933
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:17,280
And be like...

3934
02:32:17,280 --> 02:32:18,520
Hey buddy, I think you're crazy.

3935
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:20,100
You're insane!

3936
02:32:27,620 --> 02:32:28,560
Okay, but...

3937
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:30,060
Whose horse is this?

3938
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:31,340
Is it yours?

3939
02:32:31,960 --> 02:32:32,480
Tilna?

3940
02:32:32,740 --> 02:32:32,960
Oh!

3941
02:32:33,460 --> 02:32:33,560
Tilna!

3942
02:32:33,560 --> 02:32:33,900
Tilna!

3943
02:32:33,920 --> 02:32:34,840
If you want to buy a horse.

3944
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:36,140
She's inside.

3945
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:40,960
Trade offer.

3946
02:32:41,160 --> 02:32:41,880
I give you grapes.

3947
02:32:42,360 --> 02:32:43,160
Spider free.

3948
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:44,840
And you step on them.

3949
02:32:45,040 --> 02:32:45,820
Without shoes.

3950
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:48,040
And then you give them back to me.

3951
02:33:06,780 --> 02:33:07,300
Uh...

3952
02:33:07,300 --> 02:33:08,660
I would like to haggle.

3953
02:33:09,740 --> 02:33:12,740
Anyone looking for work should consider the fighters guild.

3954
02:33:13,080 --> 02:33:15,420
I hear they're always looking for recruits.

3955
02:33:17,700 --> 02:33:20,040
It sounds like I'm putting in most of the work.

3956
02:33:20,040 --> 02:33:20,640
Good day.

3957
02:33:20,900 --> 02:33:22,580
And getting none of those spoils.

3958
02:33:31,930 --> 02:33:32,950
What is it?

3959
02:33:33,710 --> 02:33:34,670
You want a horse?

3960
02:33:34,930 --> 02:33:36,290
I can sell you one.

3961
02:33:36,550 --> 02:33:39,290
There are no finer bay horses than those sold.

3962
02:33:39,330 --> 02:33:41,210
I have a grateful past stables.

3963
02:33:41,270 --> 02:33:42,890
I wonder where my horse is though.

3964
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:43,730
How much is a horse?

3965
02:33:44,050 --> 02:33:46,190
Our bay horses are faster than the paint horses.

3966
02:33:46,630 --> 02:33:48,150
And tougher than the chestnut.

3967
02:33:48,510 --> 02:33:50,350
You'll be proud to own one.

3968
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:51,010
Oh wow.

3969
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:56,390
Did you say 1,000 gold?

3970
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:57,850
She didn't say a price at all.

3971
02:33:59,690 --> 02:34:01,690
You mean you're too poor.

3972
02:34:01,890 --> 02:34:03,870
That's a fair price for this horse.

3973
02:34:03,990 --> 02:34:04,310
Um...

3974
02:34:04,310 --> 02:34:06,070
I got both of my horses for free.

3975
02:34:06,330 --> 02:34:06,830
So...

3976
02:34:06,830 --> 02:34:08,430
Poo poo to you.

3977
02:34:08,690 --> 02:34:09,450
Stop talking.

3978
02:34:09,890 --> 02:34:10,450
Okay.

3979
02:34:12,110 --> 02:34:13,850
I'm not allowed to sleep here?

3980
02:34:13,970 --> 02:34:14,390
It's illegal?

3981
02:34:17,150 --> 02:34:17,710
Fine.

3982
02:34:21,630 --> 02:34:23,950
If you fast travel somewhere, your horse will appear.

3983
02:34:24,210 --> 02:34:24,350
Oh!

3984
02:34:24,950 --> 02:34:28,830
But isn't it more exciting to go find my horse on an epic journey?

3985
02:34:29,290 --> 02:34:30,510
She's still there!

3986
02:34:31,030 --> 02:34:31,450
Wait.

3987
02:34:32,870 --> 02:34:34,770
My acrobatics is increasing.

3988
02:34:37,410 --> 02:34:38,270
Nope, nope.

3989
02:34:38,490 --> 02:34:39,350
They're back to work.

3990
02:34:40,330 --> 02:34:43,150
It's a hard knock life for her.

3991
02:34:43,470 --> 02:34:46,250
It's a hard knock life for her.

3992
02:34:46,490 --> 02:34:48,170
She's always...

3993
02:34:48,170 --> 02:34:48,770
Plowing...

3994
02:34:48,770 --> 02:34:50,150
Plowing the land!

3995
02:34:51,230 --> 02:34:52,030
Sorry.

3996
02:34:52,270 --> 02:34:53,170
My voice is icky.

3997
02:34:54,830 --> 02:34:57,670
And I never give her a hand.

3998
02:34:58,210 --> 02:35:00,050
It's a hard knock knife!

3999
02:35:10,090 --> 02:35:10,490
Okay.

4000
02:35:10,850 --> 02:35:12,570
What else can I do?

4001
02:35:13,250 --> 02:35:15,590
We found the guy that I thought would train me.

4002
02:35:15,710 --> 02:35:16,330
And he won't.

4003
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:17,210
Or he can't.

4004
02:35:17,230 --> 02:35:18,230
Because I'm better than him.

4005
02:35:18,970 --> 02:35:19,830
And then...

4006
02:35:19,830 --> 02:35:20,310
I...

4007
02:35:20,310 --> 02:35:21,310
Yeah, I sold my stuff.

4008
02:35:22,190 --> 02:35:23,790
Little lord tidbit about Talos.

4009
02:35:24,030 --> 02:35:25,870
Talos is the first emperor who became a god.

4010
02:35:26,210 --> 02:35:26,390
Oh.

4011
02:35:29,710 --> 02:35:30,150
Um...

4012
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:33,910
I'm just like stalking her.

4013
02:35:34,010 --> 02:35:35,450
But she's literally not doing anything.

4014
02:35:36,170 --> 02:35:37,250
What can I do for you?

4015
02:35:39,450 --> 02:35:40,430
She's got nothing...

4016
02:35:40,430 --> 02:35:41,030
I'm listening.

4017
02:35:41,030 --> 02:35:42,170
I'm gonna become her friend.

4018
02:35:43,850 --> 02:35:45,210
She hates...

4019
02:35:45,210 --> 02:35:45,910
Admir...

4020
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:46,750
She likes a joke.

4021
02:35:48,810 --> 02:35:50,410
She really likes a boast.

4022
02:35:51,590 --> 02:35:52,270
Okay.

4023
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:54,710
Jokes are good.

4024
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:56,070
That's pretty good.

4025
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:57,210
That's pretty good.

4026
02:35:57,390 --> 02:35:59,290
Don't try to manipulate me.

4027
02:35:59,530 --> 02:36:00,210
Okay.

4028
02:36:01,010 --> 02:36:01,630
Sorry, lady.

4029
02:36:01,930 --> 02:36:02,990
That's amazing.

4030
02:36:03,410 --> 02:36:04,510
Is that so?

4031
02:36:04,950 --> 02:36:05,970
Is that so?

4032
02:36:05,970 --> 02:36:06,070
Oh.

4033
02:36:09,370 --> 02:36:09,810
Um...

4034
02:36:09,810 --> 02:36:10,130
Let's see.

4035
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:13,150
Um...

4036
02:36:13,150 --> 02:36:13,410
Ugh.

4037
02:36:13,630 --> 02:36:14,070
Unlucky.

4038
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:14,550
Again.

4039
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:16,190
So unlucky.

4040
02:36:16,610 --> 02:36:17,890
You can't scare me.

4041
02:36:19,770 --> 02:36:21,630
Don't waste your flattery on me.

4042
02:36:21,810 --> 02:36:23,010
I didn't think that one through.

4043
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:25,250
I didn't think that one through at all.

4044
02:36:25,250 --> 02:36:25,530
Hero.

4045
02:36:26,770 --> 02:36:27,570
Uh...

4046
02:36:27,570 --> 02:36:28,150
Oh my gosh.

4047
02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:28,550
Again.

4048
02:36:30,090 --> 02:36:30,890
Uh...

4049
02:36:30,890 --> 02:36:31,290
Okay.

4050
02:36:32,630 --> 02:36:33,430
Um...

4051
02:36:34,470 --> 02:36:35,270
Uh...

4052
02:36:36,170 --> 02:36:36,570
Uh...

4053
02:36:41,060 --> 02:36:42,280
Not bad.

4054
02:36:42,700 --> 02:36:43,440
Not bad.

4055
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,460
Don't waste your flattery on me.

4056
02:36:47,660 --> 02:36:48,740
That's amazing.

4057
02:36:48,860 --> 02:36:50,200
You can't scare me.

4058
02:36:51,660 --> 02:36:52,660
Not great.

4059
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:54,200
Not great.

4060
02:36:54,380 --> 02:36:54,680
Not great, guys.

4061
02:36:55,160 --> 02:36:56,040
Not great.

4062
02:36:56,840 --> 02:36:57,820
Oh, gosh.

4063
02:36:57,960 --> 02:36:58,340
Oh, gosh.

4064
02:36:58,340 --> 02:36:59,160
It's going down again.

4065
02:36:59,300 --> 02:36:59,820
I hate this.

4066
02:37:00,220 --> 02:37:00,800
I hate this.

4067
02:37:01,740 --> 02:37:02,360
Uh...

4068
02:37:03,300 --> 02:37:04,580
That's pretty good.

4069
02:37:05,080 --> 02:37:06,300
That's pretty good.

4070
02:37:06,480 --> 02:37:07,580
That's amazing.

4071
02:37:08,420 --> 02:37:09,240
Oh, this sucks.

4072
02:37:09,440 --> 02:37:10,000
Let's just talk.

4073
02:37:10,260 --> 02:37:11,140
What nonsense.

4074
02:37:14,740 --> 02:37:15,940
That's pretty good.

4075
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:17,500
Is that so?

4076
02:37:17,920 --> 02:37:18,360
Mm-hmm.

4077
02:37:18,360 --> 02:37:19,540
Good one.

4078
02:37:19,920 --> 02:37:20,820
What nonsense.

4079
02:37:21,160 --> 02:37:22,120
I salute you.

4080
02:37:22,460 --> 02:37:23,300
Most impressive.

4081
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:24,120
That's good.

4082
02:37:24,240 --> 02:37:24,500
That's good.

4083
02:37:25,280 --> 02:37:25,940
That's good.

4084
02:37:26,040 --> 02:37:26,400
That's good.

4085
02:37:29,580 --> 02:37:30,080
Um...

4086
02:37:30,080 --> 02:37:31,560
You can't scare me.

4087
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:33,360
That's pretty good.

4088
02:37:33,600 --> 02:37:34,360
That's pretty good.

4089
02:37:34,520 --> 02:37:35,140
Not now.

4090
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:36,400
I salute you.

4091
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:37,800
Most impressive.

4092
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:39,060
I don't think I got it.

4093
02:37:39,080 --> 02:37:39,180
I see.

4094
02:37:39,460 --> 02:37:40,900
I don't think I got any further.

4095
02:37:42,020 --> 02:37:43,080
Be seeing you.

4096
02:37:43,240 --> 02:37:43,580
Oh, wait.

4097
02:37:43,800 --> 02:37:44,460
Go ahead, please.

4098
02:37:45,240 --> 02:37:46,960
I can ask her about Glarthur.

4099
02:37:46,960 --> 02:37:52,180
Well, I know he's a bit odd, but I've always thought he was kind of sweet.

4100
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:56,620
Lately, though, he has been stranger than usual.

4101
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,760
I think maybe he's been following me.

4102
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:02,240
I see him every morning on my way to chapel.

4103
02:38:03,020 --> 02:38:07,060
I've tried to say hello, but he always pretends not to hear me.

4104
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:08,620
Oh!

4105
02:38:10,840 --> 02:38:12,220
Be seeing you.

4106
02:38:12,440 --> 02:38:13,360
Be seeing you.

4107
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:20,820
Riemann in the southwest of the city to train bulls.

4108
02:38:20,940 --> 02:38:23,280
Wait, but I talked to him, and he said he doesn't train anymore.

4109
02:38:23,940 --> 02:38:27,540
This great field is a great place to gather materials if you wish to level up alchemy.

4110
02:38:28,180 --> 02:38:30,860
I'm not so interested in alchemy, I think.

4111
02:38:43,090 --> 02:38:43,970
Well met.

4112
02:38:44,850 --> 02:38:46,830
Let's just, uh...

4113
02:38:46,830 --> 02:38:48,370
Wait, which gate was this?

4114
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:49,010
Westgate?

4115
02:38:49,190 --> 02:38:49,330
Okay.

4116
02:38:51,250 --> 02:38:51,770
Let's...

4117
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:52,870
Um, what time is it?

4118
02:38:53,450 --> 02:38:54,890
It's only 10 a.m.?

4119
02:38:56,070 --> 02:38:57,010
Holy... wow.

4120
02:38:57,310 --> 02:38:57,510
Okay.

4121
02:38:57,770 --> 02:38:59,650
Oh, there we go.

4122
02:39:01,630 --> 02:39:02,150
Hmm.

4123
02:39:06,370 --> 02:39:07,610
What's alchemy for?

4124
02:39:08,470 --> 02:39:08,810
Ah.

4125
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:13,320
I don't know.

4126
02:39:17,740 --> 02:39:19,040
Wait, where am I?

4127
02:39:19,420 --> 02:39:20,840
Am I outside of town?

4128
02:39:22,280 --> 02:39:23,240
Oh, I...

4129
02:39:23,240 --> 02:39:23,980
I think I am.

4130
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:26,000
I just...

4131
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:26,640
I just left.

4132
02:39:27,520 --> 02:39:28,860
No, Glarther, wait!

4133
02:39:31,560 --> 02:39:32,680
Potion seller.

4134
02:39:34,300 --> 02:39:37,060
I require your finest potions.

4135
02:39:39,540 --> 02:39:40,560
Oh, I'm tired.

4136
02:39:43,960 --> 02:39:45,280
Can I have your horse?

4137
02:39:47,460 --> 02:39:48,460
What is it, citizen?

4138
02:39:49,420 --> 02:39:50,860
I would like to ask you a question.

4139
02:39:51,340 --> 02:39:52,000
Please talk to me.

4140
02:39:52,300 --> 02:39:52,820
Can I help you?

4141
02:39:53,560 --> 02:39:54,860
Okay, you could look at me.

4142
02:39:54,980 --> 02:39:56,220
He's that thief that the...

4143
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:57,020
Wait, I didn't mean that.

4144
02:39:57,040 --> 02:39:57,360
Rumors.

4145
02:39:57,500 --> 02:40:01,340
If you've got to travel, by the Nine Divines, stay on the roads.

4146
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:04,000
The wilderness just isn't safe anymore.

4147
02:40:04,480 --> 02:40:06,260
We've had sightings, you see.

4148
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:07,860
The Daedra.

4149
02:40:08,080 --> 02:40:09,000
What's the Daedra?

4150
02:40:10,360 --> 02:40:12,020
What about the Nitra?

4151
02:40:17,020 --> 02:40:19,220
There's got to be a door somewhere around here.

4152
02:40:24,880 --> 02:40:25,640
Run!

4153
02:40:26,580 --> 02:40:27,340
Run!

4154
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:29,800
Eat, Tina!

4155
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:31,660
Run!

4156
02:40:32,960 --> 02:40:35,540
I've completely forgotten about the air.

4157
02:40:35,540 --> 02:40:37,220
We don't care about that guy anymore.

4158
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:41,340
Oh, I'm back at the vineyards.

4159
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:44,000
How the hell?

4160
02:40:44,180 --> 02:40:45,140
What is that horse doing?

4161
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:48,540
He's trying to escape.

4162
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:50,760
You can do it!

4163
02:40:56,920 --> 02:40:59,480
He looks like he's made of plastic.

4164
02:41:07,930 --> 02:41:09,770
See, if that were my horse.

4165
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:15,230
He wouldn't ever be in such a...

4166
02:41:16,130 --> 02:41:17,210
precarious situation.

4167
02:41:25,290 --> 02:41:26,770
He's fine, probably.

4168
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:28,030
Oh, here we go.

4169
02:41:34,560 --> 02:41:36,200
Wait, this is where I went before.

4170
02:41:38,540 --> 02:41:39,460
Oh, here we go.

4171
02:41:39,660 --> 02:41:41,460
Oh, I think I just continued onward.

4172
02:41:41,560 --> 02:41:42,480
And that's how I left.

4173
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,420
What?

4174
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:45,880
What are you talking...

4175
02:41:45,880 --> 02:41:46,060
Come on.

4176
02:41:46,240 --> 02:41:47,540
Join the fighter's guild.

4177
02:41:48,040 --> 02:41:48,800
See the world.

4178
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,120
And get paid for it.

4179
02:41:50,240 --> 02:41:51,460
You just said I'm hated.

4180
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:52,760
Excuse me?

4181
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:54,320
Okay, I'll join the fighter's guild.

4182
02:41:54,320 --> 02:42:01,460
If you're interested, see Valena, Daunton in Coral, or Azan in Anvil, or Burrs Grow Cash in Chaydenhall.

4183
02:42:03,300 --> 02:42:06,820
The whole West Weald is pretty good goblin hunting country.

4184
02:42:07,060 --> 02:42:07,400
Okay.

4185
02:42:07,560 --> 02:42:11,240
They're thick here in Colovia, along the Valenwood and elsewhere borders.

4186
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:16,120
Yeah, I know you guys hate goblins.

4187
02:42:16,540 --> 02:42:17,480
Join the guild.

4188
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:19,060
You won't regret it.

4189
02:42:20,440 --> 02:42:21,600
He hates me!

4190
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:24,060
Oh my god.

4191
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:26,980
Ew, it's scum!

4192
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:29,840
How is this guy?

4193
02:42:29,940 --> 02:42:30,860
What are you doing here?

4194
02:42:35,460 --> 02:42:39,540
How do I get more famous?

4195
02:42:41,260 --> 02:42:43,760
Why can't you just do a favor for me, my friend?

4196
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:45,900
What?

4197
02:42:51,700 --> 02:42:54,420
Oh, I'm just pulling at my heartstrings now.

4198
02:42:54,960 --> 02:42:56,520
The whole thing...

4199
02:42:56,520 --> 02:42:57,360
alchemical.

4200
02:42:58,940 --> 02:42:59,460
Okay.

4201
02:42:59,960 --> 02:43:01,020
That's our guy.

4202
02:43:01,960 --> 02:43:02,980
Do you think he'll...

4203
02:43:02,980 --> 02:43:04,040
Oh wait, that's not our guy.

4204
02:43:04,340 --> 02:43:06,940
I have pity on an old war veteran.

4205
02:43:07,080 --> 02:43:07,560
Oh, you...

4206
02:43:07,560 --> 02:43:09,200
I don't think you're telling the truth.

4207
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:14,220
This is...

4208
02:43:14,220 --> 02:43:15,060
What am I...

4209
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:15,680
Where am I?

4210
02:43:15,860 --> 02:43:16,920
I'm kind of lost.

4211
02:43:17,060 --> 02:43:17,360
Hi!

4212
02:43:17,820 --> 02:43:18,220
Hi!

4213
02:43:19,840 --> 02:43:20,960
Is this the church?

4214
02:43:20,980 --> 02:43:22,200
Yes, this must be...

4215
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:22,540
I think.

4216
02:43:22,980 --> 02:43:24,480
I think this is the church.

4217
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:26,740
So that means...

4218
02:43:26,740 --> 02:43:28,120
Glarther is around here.

4219
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:31,100
I'm just gonna wait until midnight.

4220
02:43:34,860 --> 02:43:36,380
We wait a whole...

4221
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:39,260
11 hours.

4222
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:41,800
With no interruption.

4223
02:43:41,800 --> 02:43:42,420
We'll be fine.

4224
02:43:46,980 --> 02:43:48,140
Got a question.

4225
02:43:48,320 --> 02:43:50,540
Any chance for a Virgil playthrough of DMC5?

4226
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:51,540
Maybe.

4227
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:58,040
It's not...

4228
02:43:58,040 --> 02:43:59,880
Entirely out of the question, but...

4229
02:44:00,600 --> 02:44:03,100
I think I want a break from DMC for now.

4230
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:11,020
He said meet here by...

4231
02:44:11,020 --> 02:44:11,660
At 11...

4232
02:44:11,660 --> 02:44:12,520
Or at midnight, no?

4233
02:44:18,740 --> 02:44:19,760
Oh, here he is.

4234
02:44:22,260 --> 02:44:23,640
Maybe he's heading over there.

4235
02:44:24,660 --> 02:44:26,000
I shall be...

4236
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:27,220
Not suspicious.

4237
02:44:31,150 --> 02:44:34,070
I just realized also I've been playing in third person mode.

4238
02:44:34,330 --> 02:44:34,990
Does that...

4239
02:44:34,990 --> 02:44:36,750
Does that bother you guys?

4240
02:44:36,910 --> 02:44:37,450
That it's not...

4241
02:44:37,450 --> 02:44:38,410
Like, first person?

4242
02:44:39,370 --> 02:44:40,610
Or do you guys not care?

4243
02:44:47,700 --> 02:44:48,800
Not really?

4244
02:44:49,600 --> 02:44:52,360
Yeah, I just realized I've been playing like this the whole time.

4245
02:44:55,400 --> 02:44:57,180
Blood Crust Cavern.

4246
02:44:58,320 --> 02:44:59,100
Hello.

4247
02:44:59,640 --> 02:44:59,820
Hello.

4248
02:44:59,820 --> 02:45:02,140
You saw Bernadette Penelis.

4249
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:02,700
Did you?

4250
02:45:03,380 --> 02:45:06,580
She was watching me and following me, wasn't she?

4251
02:45:08,460 --> 02:45:09,020
Uh...

4252
02:45:09,840 --> 02:45:10,740
What if...

4253
02:45:10,740 --> 02:45:12,760
Can I feed into his delusions?

4254
02:45:14,980 --> 02:45:16,640
Can I feed into them?

4255
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:21,520
They made third person much better in the remaster.

4256
02:45:21,700 --> 02:45:21,820
Oh.

4257
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:23,320
Feed the fire.

4258
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:23,940
You're right.

4259
02:45:24,180 --> 02:45:24,680
Just as I thought.

4260
02:45:24,840 --> 02:45:26,460
Just as I thought.

4261
02:45:26,980 --> 02:45:28,000
Excellent work.

4262
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:30,340
There will be a bonus in this for you.

4263
02:45:30,620 --> 02:45:31,200
Don't worry.

4264
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:33,920
What about the reward?

4265
02:45:34,060 --> 02:45:34,160
Yeah.

4266
02:45:34,560 --> 02:45:34,780
Ah.

4267
02:45:35,340 --> 02:45:35,940
Of course.

4268
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:37,340
The gold.

4269
02:45:37,980 --> 02:45:38,260
Here.

4270
02:45:38,840 --> 02:45:42,280
But there is someone else I need you to investigate.

4271
02:45:42,580 --> 02:45:42,760
Okay.

4272
02:45:44,360 --> 02:45:44,920
150.

4273
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:46,000
What else do you want me to do?

4274
02:45:46,080 --> 02:45:47,500
Tutius Sextius.

4275
02:45:47,700 --> 02:45:48,660
Do you know him?

4276
02:45:48,940 --> 02:45:50,240
A quiet fellow.

4277
02:45:51,080 --> 02:45:52,700
Appears harmless enough.

4278
02:45:53,080 --> 02:45:56,800
But I've identified him as one of my key suspects.

4279
02:45:58,000 --> 02:45:59,460
He's a clever one.

4280
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:00,820
No doubt about it.

4281
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:02,660
Eyes in the back of his head.

4282
02:46:03,020 --> 02:46:05,840
Always seems to know when I'm watching.

4283
02:46:06,160 --> 02:46:09,100
But that's where you come in.

4284
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:14,940
You should wait outside his house and see what he does when he's not watching me.

4285
02:46:15,140 --> 02:46:18,800
I'll meet you here tomorrow night to get your report.

4286
02:46:20,180 --> 02:46:20,820
Okay.

4287
02:46:20,820 --> 02:46:23,860
I always suspected she was watching me.

4288
02:46:24,220 --> 02:46:26,440
Thank you for finally confirming it.

4289
02:46:27,260 --> 02:46:29,840
I think Glarthur is going to burn the city down.

4290
02:46:31,060 --> 02:46:34,320
I think he's going to go on a massive murder rampage.

4291
02:46:34,540 --> 02:46:36,420
And kill everybody here.

4292
02:46:37,700 --> 02:46:42,160
He lives in a large house between the low gate and the east bridge.

4293
02:46:42,580 --> 02:46:43,020
Alone.

4294
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:44,240
Suspicious.

4295
02:46:44,460 --> 02:46:45,020
Don't you think?

4296
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:46,760
A guy can't live alone anymore.

4297
02:46:47,480 --> 02:46:49,480
Without it being suspicious?

4298
02:46:50,380 --> 02:46:50,700
Okay.

4299
02:46:53,700 --> 02:46:55,280
Wow, we're at 81.

4300
02:46:55,280 --> 02:46:56,760
He really likes me.

4301
02:47:00,260 --> 02:47:01,740
But I can't do anymore.

4302
02:47:02,600 --> 02:47:03,780
So wait, where was it?

4303
02:47:03,940 --> 02:47:07,180
He lives in a large house between the low gate and the east bridge.

4304
02:47:07,180 --> 02:47:08,120
And the east bridge.

4305
02:47:08,860 --> 02:47:09,020
Okay.

4306
02:47:10,600 --> 02:47:11,160
Suspicious.

4307
02:47:11,900 --> 02:47:14,540
Don't let Tutius Sextius catch you following him.

4308
02:47:14,540 --> 02:47:15,500
You don't have to say the full name.

4309
02:47:15,500 --> 02:47:17,080
He's much more dangerous than he looks.

4310
02:47:17,500 --> 02:47:19,360
You don't have to say the full name.

4311
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:24,980
Hmm.

4312
02:47:25,480 --> 02:47:25,720
Okay.

4313
02:47:26,020 --> 02:47:26,320
East.

4314
02:47:26,720 --> 02:47:27,660
We're headed west.

4315
02:47:27,880 --> 02:47:29,260
So we need to go the opposite way.

4316
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:30,540
Hi there.

4317
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:31,120
Hello.

4318
02:47:34,820 --> 02:47:35,320
Wait.

4319
02:47:35,660 --> 02:47:36,260
Is it...

4320
02:47:36,260 --> 02:47:36,980
East gate?

4321
02:47:37,880 --> 02:47:38,380
Or...

4322
02:47:38,380 --> 02:47:39,240
Right here?

4323
02:47:39,540 --> 02:47:40,460
What is this?

4324
02:47:40,660 --> 02:47:41,680
Is this the east gate?

4325
02:47:43,580 --> 02:47:44,420
East gate.

4326
02:47:44,660 --> 02:47:45,080
Almost.

4327
02:47:47,740 --> 02:47:48,760
Don't let...

4328
02:47:48,760 --> 02:47:49,480
Tootie Sexy.

4329
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:50,960
Who?

4330
02:47:51,940 --> 02:47:53,380
Oh, I found his house!

4331
02:47:53,580 --> 02:47:54,360
Oh gosh.

4332
02:47:54,460 --> 02:47:54,980
Jump scare.

4333
02:47:58,640 --> 02:48:00,380
Summit missed a manor.

4334
02:48:02,200 --> 02:48:02,320
Wait.

4335
02:48:02,700 --> 02:48:02,760
Oh.

4336
02:48:03,580 --> 02:48:04,180
Missed lock.

4337
02:48:04,480 --> 02:48:05,620
Oh, it needs a key.

4338
02:48:05,980 --> 02:48:06,660
Oh, interesting.

4339
02:48:06,900 --> 02:48:07,080
Okay.

4340
02:48:08,680 --> 02:48:09,920
The guard house.

4341
02:48:10,720 --> 02:48:11,740
Did you find it?

4342
02:48:13,100 --> 02:48:14,400
Did I find it what?

4343
02:48:15,280 --> 02:48:15,880
What?

4344
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:19,380
Visible when I say tootie is sexist?

4345
02:48:26,320 --> 02:48:28,180
12 midnight and all's well.

4346
02:48:28,640 --> 02:48:30,180
Hope it stays that way, ma'am.

4347
02:48:30,500 --> 02:48:30,740
Yep.

4348
02:48:31,120 --> 02:48:31,600
Me too.

4349
02:48:32,160 --> 02:48:34,440
You have something you want to tell me about that...

4350
02:48:34,440 --> 02:48:34,620
Oh, no, wait!

4351
02:48:34,800 --> 02:48:35,360
No, no, no, no.

4352
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:37,000
Um...

4353
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:37,780
Uh, never mind.

4354
02:48:37,980 --> 02:48:38,680
Suit yourself.

4355
02:48:39,900 --> 02:48:41,660
No, he's my...

4356
02:48:41,660 --> 02:48:42,260
Bye.

4357
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:43,680
He's my buddy right now.

4358
02:48:44,080 --> 02:48:44,640
Uh, boy.

4359
02:48:45,280 --> 02:48:45,700
Bye-bye.

4360
02:48:46,740 --> 02:48:47,300
Yeah.

4361
02:48:48,080 --> 02:48:48,820
We're not...

4362
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:50,600
We're not gonna tell you anything about him.

4363
02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:51,600
He's totally fine.

4364
02:48:53,640 --> 02:48:56,020
What's so funny about Tootie is sexist?

4365
02:48:56,980 --> 02:48:57,540
Sex...

4366
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:57,820
Sextius.

4367
02:48:58,880 --> 02:48:59,040
Sextius.

4368
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:01,020
Oh, good morning.

4369
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:05,450
Go ahead, please.

4370
02:49:08,090 --> 02:49:11,330
That Danis Artelian is a little too full of himself.

4371
02:49:11,830 --> 02:49:15,030
Sure, he's the captain of the guard, but I'm not impressed.

4372
02:49:17,170 --> 02:49:18,030
Take care.

4373
02:49:18,370 --> 02:49:18,750
Bye-bye.

4374
02:49:24,050 --> 02:49:25,490
Not much of anything here.

4375
02:49:26,170 --> 02:49:27,830
I guess we gotta wake...

4376
02:49:27,830 --> 02:49:30,570
Uh, or wait for, uh...

4377
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:31,690
Tootles to wake up.

4378
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:34,470
And then we follow him.

4379
02:49:36,490 --> 02:49:37,990
The sexy toot.

4380
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:45,400
Tootius...

4381
02:49:45,400 --> 02:49:46,740
Sex-dius.

4382
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:54,950
Do you think he's, like, supposed to be the sexiest?

4383
02:49:57,110 --> 02:49:58,210
Oh, I'm stuck.

4384
02:49:59,750 --> 02:50:01,210
Let's see what's in here.

4385
02:50:02,070 --> 02:50:04,030
Rosethorn Hall needs a key.

4386
02:50:05,310 --> 02:50:07,790
Uh, let's just stand in the middle of the street again.

4387
02:50:08,070 --> 02:50:09,670
For long hours.

4388
02:50:12,110 --> 02:50:14,670
Let's stand in the middle of the street once again.

4389
02:50:15,590 --> 02:50:17,010
E.Tina does not know how to sleep.

4390
02:50:17,710 --> 02:50:18,950
For, I don't know.

4391
02:50:19,570 --> 02:50:20,290
Eight hours.

4392
02:50:22,530 --> 02:50:23,090
This...

4393
02:50:23,090 --> 02:50:24,230
Six hours.

4394
02:50:25,150 --> 02:50:25,570
Five hours.

4395
02:50:25,750 --> 02:50:26,010
Oh, no.

4396
02:50:26,210 --> 02:50:26,730
Seven hours.

4397
02:50:27,090 --> 02:50:27,370
Wait.

4398
02:50:28,830 --> 02:50:29,770
Six hours.

4399
02:50:30,090 --> 02:50:31,190
That would be 7 a.m.

4400
02:50:31,930 --> 02:50:32,150
No.

4401
02:50:32,570 --> 02:50:33,390
Five hours.

4402
02:50:33,690 --> 02:50:34,110
Because...

4403
02:50:34,110 --> 02:50:35,710
They probably all wake up at five, no?

4404
02:50:40,410 --> 02:50:41,770
She sleeps upright.

4405
02:50:42,030 --> 02:50:43,750
Actually, E.Tina is very...

4406
02:50:43,750 --> 02:50:44,490
You know...

4407
02:50:44,490 --> 02:50:46,230
Because she's an alien.

4408
02:50:47,170 --> 02:50:48,210
She sleeps...

4409
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:49,130
Uh...

4410
02:50:49,130 --> 02:50:49,750
Who are you?

4411
02:50:51,350 --> 02:50:52,450
Good morning.

4412
02:50:52,730 --> 02:50:56,050
She gets her energy, her sleep through...

4413
02:50:56,050 --> 02:50:57,030
Um...

4414
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:58,690
Uh...

4415
02:50:59,210 --> 02:51:00,390
Photosynthesis.

4416
02:51:05,130 --> 02:51:05,650
Me?

4417
02:51:06,830 --> 02:51:07,350
I'm...

4418
02:51:07,350 --> 02:51:07,610
Falano.

4419
02:51:09,290 --> 02:51:09,690
House...

4420
02:51:10,330 --> 02:51:10,850
Falano?

4421
02:51:11,010 --> 02:51:11,310
Falano?

4422
02:51:11,310 --> 02:51:11,610
Halalo?

4423
02:51:13,230 --> 02:51:13,890
Uh-oh.

4424
02:51:14,430 --> 02:51:14,610
Wait.

4425
02:51:14,770 --> 02:51:15,190
You need...

4426
02:51:15,190 --> 02:51:16,310
You know about the Nurn route?

4427
02:51:16,910 --> 02:51:17,670
I don't know.

4428
02:51:18,130 --> 02:51:20,010
Never seen that sort of route before.

4429
02:51:20,910 --> 02:51:23,190
Head over to the Westweald Inn and talk to Cendarian.

4430
02:51:23,550 --> 02:51:25,530
He could identify it for you, I'm sure.

4431
02:51:27,130 --> 02:51:27,650
Okay.

4432
02:51:28,530 --> 02:51:30,910
I'm the only alchemist in Skinkrad.

4433
02:51:30,910 --> 02:51:32,630
Not much business here.

4434
02:51:32,830 --> 02:51:34,730
But I can't go back to Morrowind.

4435
02:51:35,130 --> 02:51:37,450
It's just like anywhere else in the Empire.

4436
02:51:37,930 --> 02:51:38,750
By the way...

4437
02:51:38,750 --> 02:51:39,370
Morrowind?

4438
02:51:39,470 --> 02:51:40,290
I've never heard of that before.

4439
02:51:40,310 --> 02:51:43,410
Do you happen to know what the fine is here in Cyrodiil for necrophilia?

4440
02:51:44,150 --> 02:51:45,170
Just asking.

4441
02:51:48,670 --> 02:51:49,310
Uh...

4442
02:51:49,310 --> 02:51:50,850
Is it the first offense?

4443
02:51:51,190 --> 02:51:52,650
Let's assume...

4444
02:51:52,650 --> 02:51:53,090
No.

4445
02:51:54,290 --> 02:51:55,810
Then it's at least 500 gold.

4446
02:51:55,990 --> 02:51:58,390
That's nothing compared to Morrowind.

4447
02:51:58,850 --> 02:51:59,490
Thanks.

4448
02:52:01,590 --> 02:52:02,330
I'm listening.

4449
02:52:02,550 --> 02:52:02,790
Nope, nope.

4450
02:52:02,970 --> 02:52:03,230
My bad.

4451
02:52:04,410 --> 02:52:04,630
Bye.

4452
02:52:04,950 --> 02:52:05,470
Bye-bye.

4453
02:52:06,470 --> 02:52:07,890
Do you think this guy's awake yet?

4454
02:52:09,270 --> 02:52:09,630
No.

4455
02:52:10,630 --> 02:52:11,590
Wait, I think he's awake.

4456
02:52:13,610 --> 02:52:14,670
He better be in here.

4457
02:52:16,610 --> 02:52:17,890
I think, uh...

4458
02:52:17,890 --> 02:52:19,450
Our lady is...

4459
02:52:19,450 --> 02:52:20,510
Um...

4460
02:52:21,090 --> 02:52:21,650
Perhaps...

4461
02:52:22,710 --> 02:52:23,750
How goes it?

4462
02:52:24,430 --> 02:52:27,670
Oh, I was expecting, like, the sexiest man.

4463
02:52:28,190 --> 02:52:28,950
You're new here.

4464
02:52:29,150 --> 02:52:30,490
Or you'd know me.

4465
02:52:31,030 --> 02:52:32,330
Tutius Sextius.

4466
02:52:32,630 --> 02:52:35,270
My people have lived in Skinkrad since the dawn.

4467
02:52:35,830 --> 02:52:37,830
Father and the Count were best of friends.

4468
02:52:43,190 --> 02:52:44,910
Uh, what do you think of Glarthor?

4469
02:52:45,230 --> 02:52:48,030
I'm sorry, but I don't think I know any Glarthor.

4470
02:52:48,690 --> 02:52:52,870
Wait, do you mean that strange wood elf that you see wandering around the city?

4471
02:52:53,230 --> 02:52:55,990
Yes, I've seen him, but never spoken to him.

4472
02:52:56,490 --> 02:53:00,870
He seems to be at the low gate every morning when I pass by my way to the castle.

4473
02:53:01,090 --> 02:53:03,890
Gives me the strangest looks, now that you mention it.

4474
02:53:03,890 --> 02:53:04,310
Uh-huh.

4475
02:53:04,310 --> 02:53:08,710
Almost like he hates me, although I have no idea why.

4476
02:53:08,990 --> 02:53:10,410
You don't even know who he is.

4477
02:53:10,570 --> 02:53:10,970
Wait, why?

4478
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:14,050
Yes, the strange wood elf who haunts the low gate every morning.

4479
02:53:14,270 --> 02:53:15,990
You said he was Glarthor.

4480
02:53:16,190 --> 02:53:19,530
I'm afraid I know nothing else about the fellow.

4481
02:53:21,850 --> 02:53:23,750
Perhaps you should seek out a priest.

4482
02:53:24,030 --> 02:53:25,110
Perhaps a beggar.

4483
02:53:25,350 --> 02:53:26,570
Or guardsman.

4484
02:53:27,250 --> 02:53:30,230
You and I, we have nothing in common.

4485
02:53:30,670 --> 02:53:32,890
What could we possibly talk about?

4486
02:53:34,750 --> 02:53:35,530
I don't know.

4487
02:53:35,730 --> 02:53:36,110
Take care.

4488
02:53:36,410 --> 02:53:38,070
What is that horrible noise?

4489
02:53:39,070 --> 02:53:40,070
What is that?

4490
02:53:44,020 --> 02:53:44,760
Reinforced door.

4491
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:45,920
It's a very easy lock.

4492
02:53:46,300 --> 02:53:47,240
Oh, okay, he's leaving.

4493
02:53:47,420 --> 02:53:47,740
Never mind.

4494
02:53:51,420 --> 02:53:52,780
Oh, it's Nimrut.

4495
02:53:55,320 --> 02:53:58,120
So it must be in his drawers or something.

4496
02:54:00,820 --> 02:54:01,700
Okay, he's leaving.

4497
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,320
Oh, please leave.

4498
02:54:04,860 --> 02:54:06,060
Why is he looking at it?

4499
02:54:06,120 --> 02:54:08,180
He's looking directly at the camera.

4500
02:54:09,100 --> 02:54:11,940
Oh, you don't know I'm here?

4501
02:54:20,220 --> 02:54:21,540
He sees me.

4502
02:54:22,080 --> 02:54:23,380
He doesn't see E-T-9.

4503
02:54:23,460 --> 02:54:24,200
He sees me.

4504
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:26,340
How am I supposed to follow?

4505
02:54:26,440 --> 02:54:27,960
I don't think I'm supposed to follow this guy.

4506
02:54:28,140 --> 02:54:29,140
I think that's really...

4507
02:54:31,620 --> 02:54:32,120
Oh, wait.

4508
02:54:34,860 --> 02:54:36,060
What time is it?

4509
02:54:36,620 --> 02:54:37,260
7 a.m.

4510
02:54:38,220 --> 02:54:38,680
Tidings.

4511
02:54:40,780 --> 02:54:41,340
Wee!

4512
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:42,080
Tidings!

4513
02:54:42,220 --> 02:54:42,500
Wee!

4514
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,280
Tidings!

4515
02:54:43,780 --> 02:54:44,340
Tidings!

4516
02:54:44,520 --> 02:54:44,860
Tidings!

4517
02:54:44,980 --> 02:54:45,480
Tidings!

4518
02:54:46,640 --> 02:54:47,940
Kick this guy in the head.

4519
02:54:50,960 --> 02:54:52,700
What door did I just hear open?

4520
02:54:53,380 --> 02:54:54,080
Good morning.

4521
02:54:54,320 --> 02:54:56,940
When one door opens, another door closes.

4522
02:54:56,940 --> 02:55:00,140
I'm only asking for a single call in the world.

4523
02:55:02,800 --> 02:55:03,680
Hi-ya!

4524
02:55:06,340 --> 02:55:09,800
If I start punching a man in front of the guards, what do you think they'll do?

4525
02:55:10,320 --> 02:55:10,860
Oh, whoops.

4526
02:55:10,920 --> 02:55:11,360
What's in here?

4527
02:55:11,640 --> 02:55:12,340
A clay bowl.

4528
02:55:13,660 --> 02:55:14,500
My fists are up.

4529
02:55:14,500 --> 02:55:15,320
What do you think they'll do?

4530
02:55:15,320 --> 02:55:19,680
H-h-h-h-h-h H-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h That might not be the case to give goods in the land of the people.

4531
02:55:20,440 --> 02:55:22,360
He once may have powerful wizards.

4532
02:55:22,860 --> 02:55:25,060
It could be a dangerous situation.

4533
02:55:25,520 --> 02:55:25,920
Goodbye.

4534
02:55:26,320 --> 02:55:26,700
How are you?

4535
02:55:26,960 --> 02:55:27,140
Oh?

4536
02:55:27,860 --> 02:55:28,100
Goodbye.

4537
02:55:30,720 --> 02:55:31,560
Do you think he's...

4538
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:33,080
Um...

4539
02:55:33,080 --> 02:55:34,240
Do you want another bounty?

4540
02:55:34,780 --> 02:55:36,360
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

4541
02:55:40,420 --> 02:55:40,560
ha.

4542
02:55:41,120 --> 02:55:42,460
I don't wanna go in there.

4543
02:55:42,860 --> 02:55:43,720
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

4544
02:55:47,690 --> 02:55:47,970
Oh.

4545
02:55:49,430 --> 02:55:50,330
Oh my gosh.

4546
02:55:50,690 --> 02:55:51,510
Maybe it's outside.

4547
02:55:51,710 --> 02:55:52,510
Maybe it's outdoors.

4548
02:55:53,110 --> 02:55:53,450
Hello.

4549
02:55:54,430 --> 02:55:54,630
Oops.

4550
02:55:55,310 --> 02:55:56,990
Maybe it's like behind his house.

4551
02:55:57,450 --> 02:55:58,630
Wait, no, that's not possible.

4552
02:55:59,250 --> 02:55:59,930
Wait, I'm stuck.

4553
02:56:00,310 --> 02:56:00,790
There we go.

4554
02:56:02,910 --> 02:56:04,770
It's gotta, yeah, it's gotta be upstairs.

4555
02:56:08,870 --> 02:56:10,610
Yeah, there's no way it'd be outside.

4556
02:56:11,850 --> 02:56:12,190
Hail.

4557
02:56:13,330 --> 02:56:14,430
Hail, actually.

4558
02:56:14,930 --> 02:56:16,130
It's partly cloudy.

4559
02:56:17,930 --> 02:56:18,490
Let's see.

4560
02:56:18,630 --> 02:56:19,530
It should be in a pod.

4561
02:56:19,710 --> 02:56:20,270
Let's try again.

4562
02:56:20,730 --> 02:56:21,750
Pod it upstairs.

4563
02:56:27,650 --> 02:56:28,850
Maybe in here?

4564
02:56:30,070 --> 02:56:31,470
Maybe in his room?

4565
02:56:32,110 --> 02:56:33,230
You think he'll notice?

4566
02:56:36,170 --> 02:56:37,750
I wish he'd leave.

4567
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:44,320
Sneak.

4568
02:57:00,660 --> 02:57:02,020
Oh, thank goodness.

4569
02:57:02,240 --> 02:57:02,740
Shut up.

4570
02:57:14,720 --> 02:57:16,480
You didn't hear anything.

4571
02:57:18,760 --> 02:57:20,000
I'm going back in.

4572
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:25,440
Maybe he's got money.

4573
02:57:26,060 --> 02:57:27,840
He's got some fancy clothes.

4574
02:57:27,980 --> 02:57:28,880
That's what he's got.

4575
02:57:30,880 --> 02:57:32,420
Oh, I don't want to deal with this.

4576
02:57:32,860 --> 02:57:33,380
Sorry.

4577
02:57:35,640 --> 02:57:37,820
Why don't you keep your money in your room?

4578
02:57:38,180 --> 02:57:39,780
So many clothes.

4579
02:57:46,280 --> 02:57:47,980
Oh, hello.

4580
02:57:48,360 --> 02:57:48,780
What?

4581
02:57:49,140 --> 02:57:49,560
What?

4582
02:57:49,780 --> 02:57:51,020
Why don't you like me?

4583
02:57:52,720 --> 02:57:53,520
All right.

4584
02:57:53,640 --> 02:57:54,500
I can persuade you.

4585
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:01,620
He loves a boast.

4586
02:58:01,880 --> 02:58:02,280
Gracious.

4587
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:02,720
Gracious.

4588
02:58:02,720 --> 02:58:03,120
What a hero.

4589
02:58:04,140 --> 02:58:04,740
Gracious.

4590
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:08,740
So, yeah, okay.

4591
02:58:09,200 --> 02:58:10,040
Admire bad.

4592
02:58:10,700 --> 02:58:11,360
Of course.

4593
02:58:12,280 --> 02:58:12,760
Sorry.

4594
02:58:13,060 --> 02:58:14,300
I don't get it.

4595
02:58:15,420 --> 02:58:16,760
You've got a point.

4596
02:58:17,140 --> 02:58:19,200
Don't waste your flattery on me.

4597
02:58:20,440 --> 02:58:22,780
Don't waste your flattery on me.

4598
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:23,680
I salute you.

4599
02:58:23,940 --> 02:58:24,940
Most impressive.

4600
02:58:25,160 --> 02:58:26,320
I can't argue with that.

4601
02:58:26,320 --> 02:58:27,900
Don't try to manipulate me.

4602
02:58:27,980 --> 02:58:28,840
You think that's funny?

4603
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:32,580
There are two types of oblivion players.

4604
02:58:32,700 --> 02:58:33,480
Those that pick...

4605
02:58:34,300 --> 02:58:37,080
Nerd and Root for the quest and those that pick it for the silence.

4606
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:37,920
Right?

4607
02:58:38,820 --> 02:58:39,540
I see.

4608
02:58:41,040 --> 02:58:41,440
Yes.

4609
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:42,960
Okay, I'll leave.

4610
02:58:43,240 --> 02:58:43,620
Goodbye.

4611
02:58:44,980 --> 02:58:46,660
I'm just trying to get through this quest.

4612
02:58:47,660 --> 02:58:48,540
Oh, wrong way.

4613
02:58:49,340 --> 02:58:49,740
Wait.

4614
02:58:50,620 --> 02:58:52,700
I can probably go through his stuff in here, right?

4615
02:58:54,140 --> 02:58:55,200
Wait, can I get...

4616
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:56,780
This is also very easy.

4617
02:58:57,900 --> 02:58:58,700
Oh, whoops.

4618
02:58:59,280 --> 02:58:59,580
Oops.

4619
02:58:59,740 --> 02:59:00,300
I didn't mean to do that.

4620
02:59:01,020 --> 02:59:01,240
Stop.

4621
02:59:01,540 --> 02:59:02,160
Put your fist away.

4622
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:07,780
To the basement!

4623
02:59:15,010 --> 02:59:16,130
Anybody down here?

4624
02:59:18,770 --> 02:59:20,510
Oh, he's got some fancy things.

4625
02:59:22,310 --> 02:59:23,130
He's got...

4626
02:59:23,130 --> 02:59:24,490
This is where he eats, I suppose.

4627
02:59:26,670 --> 02:59:28,730
Anything besides food?

4628
02:59:29,390 --> 02:59:30,650
Aw, come on.

4629
02:59:32,190 --> 02:59:34,510
I can't rob a guy of his...

4630
02:59:34,510 --> 02:59:36,790
I guess of his dishes, I could.

4631
02:59:39,810 --> 02:59:41,510
What's that hourglass for?

4632
02:59:42,770 --> 02:59:44,770
I could rob him of his plates.

4633
02:59:45,110 --> 02:59:45,790
His...

4634
02:59:45,790 --> 02:59:46,890
His dishware.

4635
02:59:47,130 --> 02:59:48,130
And sell it all.

4636
02:59:49,270 --> 02:59:49,710
Hmm.

4637
02:59:58,780 --> 02:59:59,960
It's not worth anything.

4638
03:00:01,080 --> 03:00:03,020
Oh my gosh, I thought I was poisoned for a second.

4639
03:00:03,160 --> 03:00:03,860
I was like, what...

4640
03:00:03,860 --> 03:00:05,100
Why is my vision like this?

4641
03:00:06,620 --> 03:00:07,020
Hahaha.

4642
03:00:09,440 --> 03:00:10,480
Nurn route to...

4643
03:00:10,480 --> 03:00:11,960
Lo-fi and nurn route to...

4644
03:00:13,400 --> 03:00:13,840
Oh.

4645
03:00:14,120 --> 03:00:15,000
Oh, hello.

4646
03:00:15,120 --> 03:00:15,280
Sorry.

4647
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:19,440
I'm following him.

4648
03:00:19,440 --> 03:00:20,120
I'm your relief.

4649
03:00:20,300 --> 03:00:20,800
Good.

4650
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:21,820
I'm hungry.

4651
03:00:22,520 --> 03:00:23,440
I'm hungry.

4652
03:00:26,200 --> 03:00:27,200
Are you gonna leave?

4653
03:00:29,020 --> 03:00:30,260
He was your relief.

4654
03:00:31,160 --> 03:00:32,360
Steal his skin.

4655
03:00:33,380 --> 03:00:35,360
It's hard to sell stolen stuff.

4656
03:00:35,580 --> 03:00:36,000
Really?

4657
03:00:37,340 --> 03:00:37,900
Okay.

4658
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:39,980
Oh.

4659
03:00:40,260 --> 03:00:41,560
I'm supposed to be...

4660
03:00:41,560 --> 03:00:42,260
Oh, gosh.

4661
03:00:42,280 --> 03:00:43,140
I'm looking at the view.

4662
03:00:43,340 --> 03:00:45,400
I'm not even paying attention to the man I'm following.

4663
03:00:45,980 --> 03:00:47,160
There's a man there?

4664
03:00:47,380 --> 03:00:48,620
I didn't even notice.

4665
03:00:48,620 --> 03:00:50,620
No, I'm just taking in this awesome...

4666
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:52,140
Look at...

4667
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:52,400
Look...

4668
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:52,740
Oh my gosh.

4669
03:00:52,840 --> 03:00:54,100
Everybody take a picture of...

4670
03:00:54,100 --> 03:00:54,640
Wait.

4671
03:00:54,920 --> 03:00:56,580
I think maybe this would be a better one.

4672
03:00:56,740 --> 03:00:58,100
The sun is...

4673
03:00:58,100 --> 03:00:59,580
You need to turn around, girl.

4674
03:00:59,820 --> 03:01:00,260
There you go.

4675
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:01,320
There you go.

4676
03:01:01,400 --> 03:01:02,180
Better lighting here.

4677
03:01:02,580 --> 03:01:03,580
Oh my gosh.

4678
03:01:05,720 --> 03:01:06,160
Say...

4679
03:01:06,840 --> 03:01:07,280
Hogwart!

4680
03:01:15,540 --> 03:01:16,260
Where'd he go?

4681
03:01:17,220 --> 03:01:18,560
He couldn't have gotten far.

4682
03:01:18,760 --> 03:01:19,540
Oh yeah, he didn't.

4683
03:01:20,380 --> 03:01:21,180
Hi-ya!

4684
03:01:25,120 --> 03:01:26,460
Good morning.

4685
03:01:31,640 --> 03:01:32,720
Mm-hmm.

4686
03:01:35,900 --> 03:01:36,620
Hi there.

4687
03:01:37,020 --> 03:01:37,420
Hello.

4688
03:01:45,360 --> 03:01:46,900
Good morning to you.

4689
03:01:47,140 --> 03:01:48,380
I'm just practicing...

4690
03:01:48,380 --> 03:01:50,080
My jumping jacks...

4691
03:01:50,860 --> 03:01:51,880
In the morning.

4692
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:53,980
Everybody needs a good...

4693
03:01:54,640 --> 03:01:55,180
Uh...

4694
03:01:56,020 --> 03:01:57,040
Routine.

4695
03:02:03,740 --> 03:02:04,320
Guys...

4696
03:02:04,320 --> 03:02:04,840
I don't...

4697
03:02:04,840 --> 03:02:06,560
I think this quest is boring.

4698
03:02:07,460 --> 03:02:08,500
Greetings to you.

4699
03:02:11,280 --> 03:02:13,940
Guys, I think this quest is a little...

4700
03:02:16,480 --> 03:02:17,060
Uh...

4701
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:17,680
Morning.

4702
03:02:22,100 --> 03:02:23,560
He's going to the castle.

4703
03:02:27,210 --> 03:02:29,370
You can just wait behind the church and lie.

4704
03:02:29,930 --> 03:02:30,770
Wait, really?

4705
03:02:32,230 --> 03:02:33,670
Okay, let's go to the church.

4706
03:02:38,490 --> 03:02:38,970
Uh...

4707
03:02:42,210 --> 03:02:44,810
I haven't forgotten about the main quest.

4708
03:02:45,110 --> 03:02:46,070
I'm just, uh...

4709
03:02:46,070 --> 03:02:47,150
I was just excited...

4710
03:02:47,150 --> 03:02:49,870
I was so excited to do another quest.

4711
03:02:50,690 --> 03:02:51,330
And...

4712
03:02:51,330 --> 03:02:53,190
Garthor is just such a...

4713
03:02:54,590 --> 03:02:56,650
Persuasive and interesting guy.

4714
03:02:58,330 --> 03:02:59,890
Oh, speak of the devil.

4715
03:03:00,350 --> 03:03:02,310
Just want you to see that I'm very busy.

4716
03:03:02,950 --> 03:03:04,410
Everyone's talking to me at once.

4717
03:03:05,810 --> 03:03:08,190
I told you not to speak to me in public.

4718
03:03:08,410 --> 03:03:08,830
Oh, sorry.

4719
03:03:09,390 --> 03:03:09,890
Sorry.

4720
03:03:10,130 --> 03:03:13,330
I have no idea what time it is.

4721
03:03:13,450 --> 03:03:14,370
Yeah, and he pays.

4722
03:03:14,610 --> 03:03:14,990
So true.

4723
03:03:15,410 --> 03:03:16,210
How are you doing?

4724
03:03:16,430 --> 03:03:19,290
I can eat for a day with a single coin.

4725
03:03:22,490 --> 03:03:23,270
Gray fox.

4726
03:03:23,530 --> 03:03:24,690
He's a fairy tale.

4727
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:26,490
Imperial watch.

4728
03:03:26,650 --> 03:03:30,070
Pretends there is a thief king named the Gray Fox.

4729
03:03:30,310 --> 03:03:33,070
Who controls all the thieves in Cyridil.

4730
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:37,670
Of course, it's all just made up to give them an excuse to keep us down.

4731
03:03:37,990 --> 03:03:38,950
Wait, you said that before.

4732
03:03:39,530 --> 03:03:40,670
Oh, it's still...

4733
03:03:40,670 --> 03:03:41,190
That's weird.

4734
03:03:41,330 --> 03:03:41,870
Have a coin.

4735
03:03:42,270 --> 03:03:43,910
Thank you, kind lady.

4736
03:03:45,490 --> 03:03:48,010
One gold removed from the player's inventory.

4737
03:03:49,030 --> 03:03:50,070
Yeah, that's from Garthor.

4738
03:03:50,810 --> 03:03:52,970
Blessings of our king upon you.

4739
03:03:53,370 --> 03:03:54,670
Alright, let's go to the church.

4740
03:03:55,370 --> 03:03:57,350
And we wait there until midnight.

4741
03:03:58,990 --> 03:04:01,010
Yeah, we did get the letter from Gray Fox.

4742
03:04:05,350 --> 03:04:06,470
It's a love letter.

4743
03:04:08,790 --> 03:04:10,810
Let's wait until...

4744
03:04:12,770 --> 03:04:13,810
Wait, how...

4745
03:04:13,810 --> 03:04:14,750
Uh...

4746
03:04:14,750 --> 03:04:14,970
Wait.

4747
03:04:15,310 --> 03:04:15,790
Eleven.

4748
03:04:16,730 --> 03:04:17,250
Twelve.

4749
03:04:18,090 --> 03:04:18,350
One.

4750
03:04:18,610 --> 03:04:18,750
Two.

4751
03:04:19,010 --> 03:04:19,190
Three.

4752
03:04:19,410 --> 03:04:19,690
Four.

4753
03:04:19,970 --> 03:04:20,450
Five.

4754
03:04:20,970 --> 03:04:21,210
Six.

4755
03:04:21,470 --> 03:04:21,710
Seven.

4756
03:04:21,970 --> 03:04:22,170
Eight.

4757
03:04:22,470 --> 03:04:22,610
Nine.

4758
03:04:22,950 --> 03:04:23,150
Ten.

4759
03:04:23,650 --> 03:04:24,770
Oh, I'm so stupid.

4760
03:04:24,990 --> 03:04:25,150
Yeah.

4761
03:04:25,650 --> 03:04:25,870
Wait.

4762
03:04:26,030 --> 03:04:26,450
Eleven.

4763
03:04:28,130 --> 03:04:28,650
Yes.

4764
03:04:30,110 --> 03:04:32,430
Metal Gear lore goes all the way back, huh?

4765
03:04:32,530 --> 03:04:33,030
It does!

4766
03:04:33,030 --> 03:04:35,050
Thirteen hours.

4767
03:04:35,050 --> 03:04:35,090
Thirteen hours.

4768
03:04:46,220 --> 03:04:46,840
Psst.

4769
03:04:47,460 --> 03:04:48,440
Garthor.

4770
03:04:49,660 --> 03:04:50,300
Psst.

4771
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:52,480
Garthor.

4772
03:04:53,600 --> 03:04:54,380
Psst.

4773
03:04:54,620 --> 03:04:55,160
Garthor.

4774
03:04:56,760 --> 03:04:57,360
Psst.

4775
03:04:57,680 --> 03:04:58,620
Garthor.

4776
03:04:59,420 --> 03:05:00,480
What is this one?

4777
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:05,200
Psst.

4778
03:05:05,460 --> 03:05:05,980
Garthor.

4779
03:05:06,700 --> 03:05:08,300
Garthor, where are you?

4780
03:05:11,000 --> 03:05:12,000
What if...

4781
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:15,560
When Frank Jaeger got smooshed in one, he got isekai-ed?

4782
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:17,260
That's what I think.

4783
03:05:19,140 --> 03:05:20,020
Where is he?

4784
03:05:21,560 --> 03:05:22,640
Where's my pal?

4785
03:05:23,640 --> 03:05:24,140
Hello?

4786
03:05:24,560 --> 03:05:25,140
Are you in the...

4787
03:05:25,140 --> 03:05:25,740
Oh, there he is.

4788
03:05:26,660 --> 03:05:28,260
What if I pickpocket him?

4789
03:05:34,610 --> 03:05:36,670
He only has eleven gold on him!

4790
03:05:36,910 --> 03:05:38,790
Wait, what's the key he's got?

4791
03:05:41,670 --> 03:05:42,950
What's quicksave again?

4792
03:05:46,600 --> 03:05:47,180
F5?

4793
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:48,220
Oh, hello.

4794
03:05:48,400 --> 03:05:50,780
Tell me what you learned about Tutius Sextius.

4795
03:05:52,160 --> 03:05:55,160
Uh, he is spying on you.

4796
03:05:55,680 --> 03:05:56,660
F5, thank you.

4797
03:05:56,820 --> 03:05:58,220
I was right all along!

4798
03:05:58,520 --> 03:06:01,020
You're doing excellent work, my friend.

4799
03:06:02,720 --> 03:06:03,660
Mm-hmm.

4800
03:06:05,100 --> 03:06:05,520
And my money?

4801
03:06:06,240 --> 03:06:08,220
Here you go, my friend.

4802
03:06:08,680 --> 03:06:11,240
Trust me, you've earned it.

4803
03:06:11,500 --> 03:06:14,860
There is one last person that needs looking into, though.

4804
03:06:15,120 --> 03:06:15,460
Okay, okay.

4805
03:06:16,020 --> 03:06:16,380
Yes.

4806
03:06:16,820 --> 03:06:17,160
200!

4807
03:06:17,160 --> 03:06:19,720
Do you know David Suralee?

4808
03:06:19,980 --> 03:06:20,620
David?

4809
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:23,100
Yes, of the famous Suralee vineyards.

4810
03:06:23,160 --> 03:06:24,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4811
03:06:24,020 --> 03:06:26,080
Pillar of the community, etc.

4812
03:06:26,940 --> 03:06:28,900
Who would ever suspect him?

4813
03:06:28,900 --> 03:06:33,480
Perfect cover for the ringleader of the whole conspiracy.

4814
03:06:34,140 --> 03:06:36,360
He watches my house constantly.

4815
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:37,900
You'll see.

4816
03:06:38,900 --> 03:06:41,520
He leaves his house early each morning.

4817
03:06:41,840 --> 03:06:46,000
Watch him and report back to me here at midnight as usual.

4818
03:06:46,360 --> 03:06:48,080
Make sure he doesn't notice you.

4819
03:06:48,740 --> 03:06:49,380
Okay.

4820
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:52,640
Okay.

4821
03:06:52,640 --> 03:06:53,120
Be careful.

4822
03:06:53,440 --> 03:06:55,400
David Suralee is the ringleader.

4823
03:06:55,700 --> 03:06:58,140
You must not let him catch you watching him.

4824
03:06:58,280 --> 03:06:58,600
Okay.

4825
03:06:59,160 --> 03:07:00,200
I got you.

4826
03:07:01,400 --> 03:07:02,000
Wait.

4827
03:07:02,220 --> 03:07:02,500
Now?

4828
03:07:02,680 --> 03:07:02,960
Hold on.

4829
03:07:06,460 --> 03:07:07,100
F5.

4830
03:07:07,480 --> 03:07:08,300
Quick save.

4831
03:07:14,110 --> 03:07:16,290
Oh, it is his key to his house.

4832
03:07:22,330 --> 03:07:25,390
Thanks for the payment, Garthor.

4833
03:07:30,510 --> 03:07:31,030
Okay.

4834
03:07:31,770 --> 03:07:32,290
Now...

4835
03:07:32,290 --> 03:07:33,310
Um...

4836
03:07:33,310 --> 03:07:35,030
I want to go talk to the guy, though.

4837
03:07:35,670 --> 03:07:36,190
Let's see.

4838
03:07:36,270 --> 03:07:37,290
I'm going to wait...

4839
03:07:38,630 --> 03:07:39,150
Like...

4840
03:07:40,030 --> 03:07:41,050
12 hours.

4841
03:07:42,990 --> 03:07:45,050
We'll go to the, uh...

4842
03:07:45,750 --> 03:07:47,050
We'll go to the...

4843
03:07:48,850 --> 03:07:49,330
Vineyard.

4844
03:07:49,470 --> 03:07:50,970
And we're going to ask him about...

4845
03:07:50,970 --> 03:07:51,630
About him.

4846
03:07:53,710 --> 03:07:54,670
So paranoid.

4847
03:07:54,950 --> 03:07:56,170
Didn't realize he should...

4848
03:07:56,170 --> 03:07:56,470
That...

4849
03:07:57,010 --> 03:07:58,530
He should be watching you.

4850
03:07:58,770 --> 03:07:59,530
Yeah, exactly.

4851
03:07:59,990 --> 03:08:00,790
Ha ha ha ha ha.

4852
03:08:01,930 --> 03:08:02,790
Oh, who are you?

4853
03:08:02,850 --> 03:08:03,850
How can I help you?

4854
03:08:04,090 --> 03:08:05,090
Ah, you can't.

4855
03:08:05,830 --> 03:08:06,310
Wait.

4856
03:08:06,510 --> 03:08:06,790
Where's...

4857
03:08:06,790 --> 03:08:07,770
Which way is the vineyards again?

4858
03:08:08,230 --> 03:08:08,870
This way?

4859
03:08:09,610 --> 03:08:11,490
My athletics have increased to 30.

4860
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:12,010
Let's go.

4861
03:08:14,210 --> 03:08:14,850
Hi there.

4862
03:08:15,170 --> 03:08:15,430
Hello.

4863
03:08:20,110 --> 03:08:20,550
Hoop.

4864
03:08:21,710 --> 03:08:21,930
Hoop.

4865
03:08:22,810 --> 03:08:23,090
Wait.

4866
03:08:26,190 --> 03:08:27,410
Wait, they're not talking about him.

4867
03:08:27,410 --> 03:08:27,550
Sure.

4868
03:08:28,130 --> 03:08:28,610
Good day.

4869
03:08:28,890 --> 03:08:29,070
Oh.

4870
03:08:29,150 --> 03:08:31,430
I'm only asking for a single coin.

4871
03:08:31,590 --> 03:08:32,490
Wait, what'd you do about him?

4872
03:08:32,490 --> 03:08:33,130
Make it quick.

4873
03:08:33,350 --> 03:08:34,570
What are you saying about...

4874
03:08:34,570 --> 03:08:35,190
What are you saying?

4875
03:08:35,390 --> 03:08:35,870
What are you saying?

4876
03:08:35,990 --> 03:08:38,790
I enjoy the wines that Tamika makes at her vineyard.

4877
03:08:38,870 --> 03:08:41,530
And they're reasonably priced as well.

4878
03:08:42,010 --> 03:08:42,530
Yeah.

4879
03:08:42,750 --> 03:08:42,950
Okay.

4880
03:08:44,290 --> 03:08:45,250
Have a good day now.

4881
03:08:45,330 --> 03:08:47,650
Have pity on the old war victory.

4882
03:08:49,150 --> 03:08:49,670
Um.

4883
03:08:50,050 --> 03:08:50,950
Is it this one?

4884
03:08:52,290 --> 03:08:53,050
I can't.

4885
03:08:53,150 --> 03:08:53,770
This place is...

4886
03:08:53,770 --> 03:08:54,710
Oh, they all look the same.

4887
03:08:56,370 --> 03:08:56,670
Uh.

4888
03:08:59,810 --> 03:09:00,330
Which...

4889
03:09:01,870 --> 03:09:03,090
Surly Brothers House.

4890
03:09:04,050 --> 03:09:04,570
Okay.

4891
03:09:04,730 --> 03:09:05,330
So to the red.

4892
03:09:08,960 --> 03:09:10,600
We're at the west gate.

4893
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:12,860
I can't remember which gate is the...

4894
03:09:12,860 --> 03:09:13,620
He's...

4895
03:09:13,620 --> 03:09:16,360
Surely he's not at his house anymore.

4896
03:09:16,840 --> 03:09:17,180
You know?

4897
03:09:18,120 --> 03:09:19,360
It must be this one.

4898
03:09:20,140 --> 03:09:20,820
Yeah.

4899
03:09:22,420 --> 03:09:23,020
Uh.

4900
03:09:23,780 --> 03:09:26,380
But I don't remember where the vineyards are.

4901
03:09:30,580 --> 03:09:32,460
I can't remember.

4902
03:09:33,880 --> 03:09:34,880
It's you.

4903
03:09:35,240 --> 03:09:35,920
Hi.

4904
03:09:37,460 --> 03:09:38,500
I'm back.

4905
03:09:38,700 --> 03:09:39,820
I know it's outside.

4906
03:09:40,200 --> 03:09:41,540
I guess I'll just leave.

4907
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:43,620
Through one of the gates.

4908
03:09:44,200 --> 03:09:44,860
No time to talk.

4909
03:09:45,140 --> 03:09:45,900
No time to talk.

4910
03:09:47,500 --> 03:09:48,520
West gate?

4911
03:09:48,900 --> 03:09:49,280
Oh.

4912
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:50,320
Hup.

4913
03:09:52,660 --> 03:09:53,600
We're fine.

4914
03:10:02,830 --> 03:10:04,430
I just want to ask him.

4915
03:10:04,590 --> 03:10:05,110
Oh, who are you?

4916
03:10:05,510 --> 03:10:05,890
Afternoon.

4917
03:10:06,250 --> 03:10:06,550
Till...

4918
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:07,470
Oh, you're Tillmo.

4919
03:10:10,470 --> 03:10:11,150
Um.

4920
03:10:12,290 --> 03:10:13,890
Her sheep are escaping!

4921
03:10:14,570 --> 03:10:15,350
Hello there.

4922
03:10:15,570 --> 03:10:16,010
Hello.

4923
03:10:17,510 --> 03:10:18,550
Is this him?

4924
03:10:20,130 --> 03:10:20,810
What?

4925
03:10:20,870 --> 03:10:21,650
No, you're Shamir.

4926
03:10:22,590 --> 03:10:23,450
Never mind.

4927
03:10:25,390 --> 03:10:26,070
Goodbye.

4928
03:10:26,390 --> 03:10:26,790
Goodbye.

4929
03:10:27,930 --> 03:10:28,850
Is it this guy over here?

4930
03:10:32,680 --> 03:10:34,220
Our ankles aren't broken.

4931
03:10:34,220 --> 03:10:35,580
We're totally fine.

4932
03:10:35,980 --> 03:10:36,080
Wait.

4933
03:10:42,430 --> 03:10:43,830
What are you guys doing?

4934
03:10:50,540 --> 03:10:52,600
I don't think that's how that works.

4935
03:10:53,660 --> 03:10:54,020
Wait.

4936
03:10:58,640 --> 03:10:59,240
Um...

4937
03:11:01,760 --> 03:11:02,940
Uh...

4938
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:03,440
David.

4939
03:11:03,800 --> 03:11:04,260
The V-Day.

4940
03:11:05,940 --> 03:11:06,860
Which one is...

4941
03:11:06,860 --> 03:11:07,480
You're not...

4942
03:11:07,480 --> 03:11:08,240
No, you're...

4943
03:11:08,240 --> 03:11:08,520
Yes.

4944
03:11:08,520 --> 03:11:10,600
Can you please train me?

4945
03:11:11,220 --> 03:11:11,740
No.

4946
03:11:14,840 --> 03:11:15,640
I'm listening.

4947
03:11:15,740 --> 03:11:17,160
Maybe if I make you like me more.

4948
03:11:22,370 --> 03:11:22,890
Okay.

4949
03:11:22,950 --> 03:11:23,790
You're like a joke.

4950
03:11:24,730 --> 03:11:25,790
You hate boasts.

4951
03:11:25,910 --> 03:11:26,530
You're full of it.

4952
03:11:31,350 --> 03:11:31,870
Uh...

4953
03:11:33,530 --> 03:11:34,050
Uh...

4954
03:11:34,690 --> 03:11:36,310
You can't scare me.

4955
03:11:36,470 --> 03:11:36,950
Hold on.

4956
03:11:37,070 --> 03:11:37,830
I messed it up.

4957
03:11:38,030 --> 03:11:38,310
Wait.

4958
03:11:39,390 --> 03:11:40,310
Oh, gosh.

4959
03:11:40,670 --> 03:11:41,510
How nice.

4960
03:11:41,750 --> 03:11:43,010
That's really funny.

4961
03:11:43,230 --> 03:11:44,130
That's really funny.

4962
03:11:44,330 --> 03:11:44,530
Okay.

4963
03:11:45,770 --> 03:11:46,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4964
03:11:46,490 --> 03:11:47,430
That's really funny, right?

4965
03:11:47,770 --> 03:11:48,770
That's just talk.

4966
03:11:49,250 --> 03:11:49,510
Oh.

4967
03:11:50,350 --> 03:11:51,030
How nice.

4968
03:11:51,270 --> 03:11:52,490
Oh, that's great.

4969
03:11:53,030 --> 03:11:54,030
You're pathetic.

4970
03:11:54,690 --> 03:11:55,890
See, we're at 70 now.

4971
03:11:56,270 --> 03:11:56,590
Wait, what?

4972
03:11:56,690 --> 03:11:57,350
Don't say I'm pathetic.

4973
03:11:58,130 --> 03:11:58,450
Yes.

4974
03:11:58,910 --> 03:11:59,970
Now, train me.

4975
03:12:00,490 --> 03:12:00,950
No.

4976
03:12:01,510 --> 03:12:01,750
No.

4977
03:12:01,910 --> 03:12:02,450
We'll be seeing you.

4978
03:12:02,450 --> 03:12:03,170
Okay, bye.

4979
03:12:05,910 --> 03:12:06,430
Hello.

4980
03:12:07,610 --> 03:12:09,850
I don't even see a Davide around here.

4981
03:12:20,720 --> 03:12:22,360
I just wanted to ask him about...

4982
03:12:22,360 --> 03:12:22,480
Good afternoon.

4983
03:12:24,540 --> 03:12:25,060
...about...

4984
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,220
Garthur.

4985
03:12:26,480 --> 03:12:26,860
Garthur?

4986
03:12:27,080 --> 03:12:27,660
What's his name?

4987
03:12:28,040 --> 03:12:28,580
Can't remember.

4988
03:12:28,780 --> 03:12:28,960
Oh.

4989
03:12:29,360 --> 03:12:30,120
Oh, gosh.

4990
03:12:30,680 --> 03:12:31,280
Oh, no.

4991
03:12:32,300 --> 03:12:32,820
Don't do...

4992
03:12:32,820 --> 03:12:33,400
He's like, no.

4993
03:12:33,640 --> 03:12:34,560
I can't do it.

4994
03:12:37,500 --> 03:12:38,020
Garthur.

4995
03:12:38,340 --> 03:12:38,860
Garfield.

4996
03:12:41,700 --> 03:12:43,840
I don't see anyone else around here.

4997
03:12:44,740 --> 03:12:44,820
Hmm.

4998
03:12:46,180 --> 03:12:47,280
Oh, maybe over here?

4999
03:12:48,560 --> 03:12:49,240
No.

5000
03:12:49,580 --> 03:12:50,620
So foggy.

5001
03:12:50,900 --> 03:12:51,400
It's spooky.

5002
03:12:55,580 --> 03:12:56,260
Hmm.

5003
03:13:01,450 --> 03:13:03,490
There is nobody by this name.

5004
03:13:03,890 --> 03:13:04,870
Does not exist.

5005
03:13:05,430 --> 03:13:06,770
He does not exist.

5006
03:13:08,410 --> 03:13:10,130
Now he's making up...

5007
03:13:10,130 --> 03:13:10,930
People.

5008
03:13:12,030 --> 03:13:13,170
Not in here.

5009
03:13:13,510 --> 03:13:14,010
Okay, bye.

5010
03:13:14,910 --> 03:13:15,350
Hmm.

5011
03:13:16,050 --> 03:13:17,250
Is that the red quest marker?

5012
03:13:17,350 --> 03:13:19,130
That was his house, but I couldn't go inside.

5013
03:13:25,190 --> 03:13:26,010
Who are you?

5014
03:13:27,670 --> 03:13:28,550
I'm Tamika.

5015
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:28,950
Oh.

5016
03:13:29,170 --> 03:13:31,790
We grow our own grapes and make fine wines.

5017
03:13:32,510 --> 03:13:32,910
Okay.

5018
03:13:33,350 --> 03:13:33,790
Tamika.

5019
03:13:34,230 --> 03:13:37,770
I need to head over to Colobian Traders and pick up a few things from Goonder.

5020
03:13:38,310 --> 03:13:39,790
He's got a nice selection.

5021
03:13:39,930 --> 03:13:40,850
I sold to him.

5022
03:13:40,850 --> 03:13:44,890
You might pick up my second-hand goods.

5023
03:13:49,570 --> 03:13:51,730
I've seen actually...

5024
03:13:51,730 --> 03:13:54,150
Here, it is perfect for grapes and perfect for wine.

5025
03:13:54,190 --> 03:13:56,970
I've seen only grapes, but no wine.

5026
03:13:56,970 --> 03:13:59,410
But the climate is milder.

5027
03:13:59,730 --> 03:14:00,050
But the climate is milder.

5028
03:14:00,050 --> 03:14:01,330
And the rainfall more reliable.

5029
03:14:03,890 --> 03:14:04,490
Bye.

5030
03:14:04,850 --> 03:14:05,190
Bye.

5031
03:14:07,170 --> 03:14:09,230
I guess we'll go to the...

5032
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:12,410
He's doing a lot...

5033
03:14:12,410 --> 03:14:14,210
A lot of really good guarding.

5034
03:14:16,230 --> 03:14:17,810
He can buy it at the inn.

5035
03:14:18,110 --> 03:14:18,310
Oh.

5036
03:14:19,010 --> 03:14:19,870
I see.

5037
03:14:22,330 --> 03:14:23,070
Let's see.

5038
03:14:23,250 --> 03:14:23,750
Well met.

5039
03:14:24,790 --> 03:14:26,070
I'm running, running.

5040
03:14:26,490 --> 03:14:27,250
Running, running.

5041
03:14:31,470 --> 03:14:32,550
It was...

5042
03:14:32,550 --> 03:14:32,890
Huh?

5043
03:14:33,390 --> 03:14:34,550
Oh, over here.

5044
03:14:43,470 --> 03:14:44,310
Yeah, see?

5045
03:14:44,310 --> 03:14:45,090
I can't get in.

5046
03:14:46,430 --> 03:14:47,190
You know what?

5047
03:14:47,270 --> 03:14:47,650
Screw it.

5048
03:14:47,650 --> 03:14:48,610
I'm going back to the...

5049
03:14:48,610 --> 03:14:49,310
I'm just going to lie.

5050
03:14:49,910 --> 03:14:51,350
We're lying to him anyway.

5051
03:14:51,350 --> 03:14:51,930
What's another...

5052
03:14:51,930 --> 03:14:52,810
What's another lie?

5053
03:14:53,510 --> 03:14:54,370
What was that?

5054
03:14:57,600 --> 03:15:00,160
Who will help an old beggar?

5055
03:15:01,660 --> 03:15:04,100
The NPCs in this game are so funny.

5056
03:15:06,760 --> 03:15:07,400
Okay.

5057
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:08,980
Now we wait.

5058
03:15:13,700 --> 03:15:16,020
It would be ten...

5059
03:15:17,540 --> 03:15:18,600
Nine hours.

5060
03:15:25,940 --> 03:15:26,480
Two.

5061
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:27,500
One.

5062
03:15:27,980 --> 03:15:30,240
Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.

5063
03:15:33,900 --> 03:15:34,440
Glarthor.

5064
03:15:34,800 --> 03:15:34,900
Shh.

5065
03:15:35,080 --> 03:15:35,600
Glarthor.

5066
03:15:35,700 --> 03:15:40,480
So, what did you discover about the upstanding Daveed Surly?

5067
03:15:40,680 --> 03:15:41,060
Oh, God.

5068
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:42,320
This guy's about to murder everybody.

5069
03:15:42,760 --> 03:15:44,120
He is spying on you.

5070
03:15:44,520 --> 03:15:47,220
And so, it all falls into place.

5071
03:15:47,620 --> 03:15:48,600
Yes, yes.

5072
03:15:48,600 --> 03:15:50,340
It all makes sense now.

5073
03:15:53,340 --> 03:15:53,880
Here.

5074
03:15:54,260 --> 03:15:56,640
This is your last task.

5075
03:15:57,320 --> 03:15:58,140
What's that?

5076
03:15:58,680 --> 03:15:59,640
My reward?

5077
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:00,700
Here's the gold.

5078
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:01,920
As promised.

5079
03:16:02,260 --> 03:16:04,000
I always pay my debts.

5080
03:16:04,220 --> 03:16:04,960
And then some.

5081
03:16:05,560 --> 03:16:07,580
Do the last task.

5082
03:16:07,800 --> 03:16:08,580
In that note.

5083
03:16:09,100 --> 03:16:12,200
And I will pay you much, much more.

5084
03:16:12,460 --> 03:16:14,220
Did you guys see what the note was called?

5085
03:16:29,810 --> 03:16:31,230
List of death.

5086
03:16:32,390 --> 03:16:34,690
These people must be killed.

5087
03:16:34,910 --> 03:16:35,850
There's no choice.

5088
03:16:36,030 --> 03:16:38,130
They are definitely conspiring against me.

5089
03:16:38,590 --> 03:16:39,830
Bernadette Penelis.

5090
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:41,870
Tutius Sextius.

5091
03:16:43,950 --> 03:16:45,070
Davide Surilly.

5092
03:16:45,550 --> 03:16:46,030
The ringleader.

5093
03:16:46,250 --> 03:16:47,050
Kill him first.

5094
03:16:47,290 --> 03:16:48,310
Come back and see me.

5095
03:16:48,450 --> 03:16:49,770
Make sure you are not followed.

5096
03:16:49,990 --> 03:16:52,250
Once it is done and I will give you your reward.

5097
03:16:52,250 --> 03:16:53,090
Blarthur.

5098
03:16:53,250 --> 03:16:53,730
I think...

5099
03:16:55,330 --> 03:16:56,930
I think we should go...

5100
03:16:57,650 --> 03:16:59,710
I think we should go...

5101
03:16:59,710 --> 03:17:00,870
Report him.

5102
03:17:06,340 --> 03:17:07,880
I've been working for the feds.

5103
03:17:07,940 --> 03:17:09,180
I'm not loyal to anybody.

5104
03:17:14,820 --> 03:17:15,340
Guards!

5105
03:17:16,420 --> 03:17:16,940
Guards!

5106
03:17:19,380 --> 03:17:19,900
But...

5107
03:17:21,300 --> 03:17:26,220
I could sneak into their homes in the middle of the night and murder them in their bed and nobody would know.

5108
03:17:29,300 --> 03:17:30,580
How goes it?

5109
03:17:38,270 --> 03:17:39,830
It pays a lot?

5110
03:17:40,530 --> 03:17:41,450
It does?

5111
03:17:48,920 --> 03:17:50,160
He did say...

5112
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:51,080
How much is a lot?

5113
03:17:52,020 --> 03:17:53,360
We talking about a thousand?

5114
03:17:53,840 --> 03:17:54,820
A couple thousand?

5115
03:18:09,990 --> 03:18:10,990
Hold on.

5116
03:18:12,410 --> 03:18:15,810
If I quicksave and snitch on him...

5117
03:18:15,810 --> 03:18:17,390
Evening, ma'am.

5118
03:18:17,870 --> 03:18:18,130
Ma'am?

5119
03:18:20,810 --> 03:18:23,410
Urus the shepherd sure does take care of his sheep.

5120
03:18:23,710 --> 03:18:25,790
And boy, does he like cheese.

5121
03:18:25,970 --> 03:18:27,570
I mean, he really likes cheese.

5122
03:18:27,570 --> 03:18:27,970
I'll make a heart save, yeah.

5123
03:18:28,610 --> 03:18:30,210
He really likes cheese.

5124
03:18:30,430 --> 03:18:30,810
Farewell.

5125
03:18:30,970 --> 03:18:31,910
Yeah, let's make a heart save.

5126
03:18:32,070 --> 03:18:32,390
You're right.

5127
03:18:35,690 --> 03:18:37,070
I want to name it.

5128
03:18:39,850 --> 03:18:40,330
Okay.

5129
03:18:42,730 --> 03:18:44,570
Let's see what happens if I...

5130
03:18:45,250 --> 03:18:46,170
If I...

5131
03:18:46,170 --> 03:18:46,750
If I...

5132
03:18:46,750 --> 03:18:47,630
Ride him out.

5133
03:18:48,070 --> 03:18:50,270
You have something you want to tell me about that nutcase?

5134
03:18:50,710 --> 03:18:51,190
Yes!

5135
03:18:52,090 --> 03:18:52,570
Um...

5136
03:18:52,570 --> 03:18:54,090
He thinks there's a plot against him.

5137
03:18:54,250 --> 03:18:54,430
Really?

5138
03:18:55,030 --> 03:18:56,350
He's getting worse then.

5139
03:18:57,690 --> 03:18:58,970
Thanks for letting me know.

5140
03:18:59,470 --> 03:19:02,550
If you think he's becoming dangerous, you come straight to me.

5141
03:19:02,550 --> 03:19:04,030
He really likes cheese.

5142
03:19:05,170 --> 03:19:06,510
And I'll handle it.

5143
03:19:06,510 --> 03:19:08,130
He needs to be arrested.

5144
03:19:11,330 --> 03:19:13,070
I can show the note!

5145
03:19:19,510 --> 03:19:20,150
Okay.

5146
03:19:27,230 --> 03:19:28,390
I'm coming with.

5147
03:19:28,750 --> 03:19:31,190
I want to watch his face when it happens.

5148
03:19:36,030 --> 03:19:37,150
He's still here.

5149
03:19:39,150 --> 03:19:40,590
Oh, damn.

5150
03:19:48,590 --> 03:19:50,190
Mudcrabs more fearsome than you.

5151
03:19:50,550 --> 03:19:51,030
Oh.

5152
03:19:51,650 --> 03:19:51,730
Oh.

5153
03:19:53,310 --> 03:19:54,030
Glarth.

5154
03:19:54,230 --> 03:19:55,410
Oh, he just leaves.

5155
03:20:03,880 --> 03:20:04,600
Damn.

5156
03:20:05,500 --> 03:20:06,140
That's it.

5157
03:20:06,260 --> 03:20:07,220
That's it for our guy.

5158
03:20:08,700 --> 03:20:10,360
Oh, Glarth.

5159
03:20:11,460 --> 03:20:12,180
Oh.

5160
03:20:12,720 --> 03:20:13,020
Oh.

5161
03:20:15,440 --> 03:20:17,360
He died with a smile.

5162
03:20:23,720 --> 03:20:24,700
Come here.

5163
03:20:24,900 --> 03:20:25,400
Come here.

5164
03:20:27,020 --> 03:20:27,720
Come here.

5165
03:20:28,020 --> 03:20:28,740
Come here.

5166
03:20:30,520 --> 03:20:31,320
Free house.

5167
03:20:31,620 --> 03:20:31,820
True.

5168
03:20:34,720 --> 03:20:36,160
I can take his clothes, too.

5169
03:20:36,500 --> 03:20:36,920
Oh, God.

5170
03:20:37,720 --> 03:20:38,120
Glarth.

5171
03:20:38,740 --> 03:20:39,480
Oh, never mind.

5172
03:20:39,500 --> 03:20:40,480
I don't want to see your...

5173
03:20:40,480 --> 03:20:41,180
I don't want to...

5174
03:20:41,180 --> 03:20:41,960
I don't want to see that.

5175
03:20:42,980 --> 03:20:43,760
What was yours?

5176
03:20:43,940 --> 03:20:44,140
This?

5177
03:20:44,960 --> 03:20:45,640
Oh, gosh.

5178
03:20:45,800 --> 03:20:45,920
Wait.

5179
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:46,280
Put it back.

5180
03:20:46,420 --> 03:20:46,680
This one.

5181
03:20:47,400 --> 03:20:47,800
Oh.

5182
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:48,580
I can't...

5183
03:20:49,600 --> 03:20:50,000
Sorry.

5184
03:20:51,260 --> 03:20:51,660
Sorry.

5185
03:20:52,100 --> 03:20:53,320
Let's go check out his house.

5186
03:20:56,340 --> 03:20:58,780
Just goes to show that snitching doesn't pay.

5187
03:20:59,200 --> 03:20:59,380
Literally.

5188
03:20:59,880 --> 03:21:01,220
He would have paid me money.

5189
03:21:01,660 --> 03:21:03,300
Now look at where we're at.

5190
03:21:05,400 --> 03:21:06,960
Opened with Glarthor's key.

5191
03:21:14,920 --> 03:21:16,400
Oh, just auto-saved.

5192
03:21:16,500 --> 03:21:17,220
That's so scary.

5193
03:21:18,240 --> 03:21:19,520
Could I say...

5194
03:21:19,520 --> 03:21:20,760
Should I say...

5195
03:21:20,760 --> 03:21:21,660
Home sweet home?

5196
03:21:24,340 --> 03:21:24,780
Mysticism.

5197
03:21:26,440 --> 03:21:29,840
What if they were really trying to plot against him, though?

5198
03:21:30,160 --> 03:21:31,780
What if I did do the right thing?

5199
03:21:40,780 --> 03:21:41,420
Or wait.

5200
03:21:41,580 --> 03:21:42,080
I mean...

5201
03:21:42,080 --> 03:21:42,500
What if...

5202
03:21:42,500 --> 03:21:44,420
What if killing them would have been the right thing?

5203
03:21:44,480 --> 03:21:45,460
That's what I meant to say.

5204
03:21:50,740 --> 03:21:51,220
Gosh.

5205
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:53,220
Thanks for making me make the hard save.

5206
03:21:53,340 --> 03:21:55,420
Because if I had walked in here, it all would have been final.

5207
03:21:56,640 --> 03:21:58,220
Oh, I hate that.

5208
03:21:58,640 --> 03:22:00,100
I don't want that in my house.

5209
03:22:01,740 --> 03:22:02,920
Guide to Bruma.

5210
03:22:04,040 --> 03:22:06,020
Can't believe the feds got Glarthor.

5211
03:22:06,220 --> 03:22:07,640
Maybe he was right after all.

5212
03:22:08,320 --> 03:22:09,420
Oh, there's an upstairs.

5213
03:22:11,060 --> 03:22:11,840
One gold.

5214
03:22:12,200 --> 03:22:12,740
Two gold.

5215
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:13,540
Three gold.

5216
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:16,260
Four gold.

5217
03:22:16,680 --> 03:22:17,420
Five gold.

5218
03:22:18,120 --> 03:22:18,320
Five gold.

5219
03:22:19,800 --> 03:22:20,920
Eight gold.

5220
03:22:21,420 --> 03:22:23,400
Where was he getting all this money from?

5221
03:22:23,540 --> 03:22:24,240
Because...

5222
03:22:24,240 --> 03:22:26,900
I am not seeing it.

5223
03:22:27,200 --> 03:22:28,240
In his home.

5224
03:22:31,800 --> 03:22:32,560
Oh!

5225
03:22:32,940 --> 03:22:33,100
Oh!

5226
03:22:35,740 --> 03:22:37,700
Very hard cupboard!

5227
03:22:38,180 --> 03:22:40,220
I'm never seeing...

5228
03:22:40,220 --> 03:22:42,160
I've never seen one...

5229
03:22:42,160 --> 03:22:43,620
Very hard before.

5230
03:22:51,840 --> 03:22:52,600
Gosh.

5231
03:22:52,820 --> 03:22:55,180
Actually, maybe I spoke too soon.

5232
03:22:56,340 --> 03:22:56,980
No

5233
03:23:22,450 --> 03:23:22,750
way.

5234
03:23:22,750 --> 03:23:23,910
I thought I had that one.

5235
03:23:24,010 --> 03:23:24,410
For real.

5236
03:23:37,000 --> 03:23:38,020
I did it!

5237
03:23:39,020 --> 03:23:40,780
Iron war axe.

5238
03:23:42,280 --> 03:23:42,920
Whoa.

5239
03:23:45,280 --> 03:23:46,340
This one too.

5240
03:23:59,120 --> 03:23:59,760
Oh.

5241
03:24:03,430 --> 03:24:05,370
Who stores a broom in a chest?

5242
03:24:05,790 --> 03:24:06,850
Yeah, right?

5243
03:24:11,630 --> 03:24:12,830
I misread it.

5244
03:24:12,830 --> 03:24:12,890
I misread it.

5245
03:24:17,280 --> 03:24:17,840
Oh.

5246
03:24:30,470 --> 03:24:31,030
Oh!

5247
03:24:31,350 --> 03:24:31,630
I...

5248
03:24:31,630 --> 03:24:32,450
Alright, that was my fault.

5249
03:24:34,070 --> 03:24:34,910
What the?

5250
03:24:46,100 --> 03:24:46,560
Ah!

5251
03:24:57,290 --> 03:24:57,630
Ah!

5252
03:24:57,630 --> 03:24:57,730
Ah!

5253
03:25:04,770 --> 03:25:05,770
Don't let the...

5254
03:25:05,770 --> 03:25:07,310
Slow pins fall all the way.

5255
03:25:07,490 --> 03:25:08,410
But don't I have to like...

5256
03:25:08,910 --> 03:25:10,890
Get it while it's at the very top?

5257
03:25:11,030 --> 03:25:11,150
No?

5258
03:25:13,830 --> 03:25:15,250
Maybe I don't understand...

5259
03:25:15,250 --> 03:25:16,710
How it actually works.

5260
03:25:17,630 --> 03:25:19,650
You can push a pin again as it falls.

5261
03:25:32,770 --> 03:25:33,370
Oh!

5262
03:25:34,230 --> 03:25:34,830
My

5263
03:25:54,150 --> 03:25:54,450
god!

5264
03:25:54,790 --> 03:25:56,530
That's what I thought was the slow one though!

5265
03:25:59,250 --> 03:26:00,250
This is...

5266
03:26:00,250 --> 03:26:01,410
I don't have...

5267
03:26:01,410 --> 03:26:01,850
I don't...

5268
03:26:01,850 --> 03:26:03,510
I'm gonna lose all my...

5269
03:26:03,510 --> 03:26:04,510
All my pins!

5270
03:26:04,850 --> 03:26:06,150
All my lock picks!

5271
03:26:06,150 --> 03:26:06,310
Six!

5272
03:26:07,410 --> 03:26:07,930
Oh.

5273
03:26:08,310 --> 03:26:08,430
No.

5274
03:26:08,570 --> 03:26:08,850
Get...

5275
03:26:08,850 --> 03:26:09,490
Take the money.

5276
03:26:11,110 --> 03:26:13,790
I like how I feel like I'm committing to this.

5277
03:26:13,910 --> 03:26:14,730
Even though...

5278
03:26:14,730 --> 03:26:15,350
I don't know.

5279
03:26:15,670 --> 03:26:17,410
I mean, it does have a nice place.

5280
03:26:17,950 --> 03:26:19,510
It'd be cool to live here.

5281
03:26:20,850 --> 03:26:21,370
Ugh.

5282
03:26:23,110 --> 03:26:24,710
I'm gonna try the hard one.

5283
03:26:26,150 --> 03:26:26,670
Wait.

5284
03:26:26,690 --> 03:26:27,770
Which one was the hard one?

5285
03:26:28,970 --> 03:26:29,750
Oh, here.

5286
03:26:30,730 --> 03:26:32,050
I want this one.

5287
03:26:40,160 --> 03:26:41,100
It's like...

5288
03:26:41,100 --> 03:26:43,640
I can't read it very well, obviously.

5289
03:26:44,120 --> 03:26:44,600
Cause...

5290
03:26:44,600 --> 03:26:47,420
I can't tell when it's gonna be so fast or not.

5291
03:26:49,320 --> 03:26:49,920
Ah, shit.

5292
03:27:00,520 --> 03:27:01,780
How could you tell?

5293
03:27:02,460 --> 03:27:04,240
Spam the pick when it looks slow.

5294
03:27:04,700 --> 03:27:06,660
Wait, what do you mean, spam the pick?

5295
03:27:17,290 --> 03:27:18,110
Like this?

5296
03:27:20,210 --> 03:27:21,770
How can I even read it though?

5297
03:27:21,890 --> 03:27:22,770
It all looks fast.

5298
03:27:29,320 --> 03:27:31,060
It all looks fast to me though.

5299
03:27:39,020 --> 03:27:40,360
Oh, like that.

5300
03:27:40,980 --> 03:27:41,740
Oh, I...

5301
03:27:43,060 --> 03:27:44,100
Oh!

5302
03:27:48,640 --> 03:27:49,560
Like that!

5303
03:27:50,980 --> 03:27:51,800
Oh!

5304
03:28:01,680 --> 03:28:02,580
Oh my god.

5305
03:28:07,350 --> 03:28:08,330
Oh, man.

5306
03:28:12,800 --> 03:28:13,680
So close.

5307
03:28:14,380 --> 03:28:15,040
Oops.

5308
03:28:16,160 --> 03:28:16,900
Oops.

5309
03:28:18,420 --> 03:28:18,980
Oops.

5310
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:24,140
Oops.

5311
03:28:29,360 --> 03:28:30,140
Oh, okay.

5312
03:28:59,090 --> 03:29:01,370
Maybe hard is still too difficult for me.

5313
03:29:07,080 --> 03:29:07,640
Okay.

5314
03:29:08,860 --> 03:29:10,960
I should probably re-watch that video first.

5315
03:29:11,100 --> 03:29:11,460
Shut up!

5316
03:29:23,140 --> 03:29:23,700
Okay.

5317
03:29:24,460 --> 03:29:27,200
I can't tell what's like... Oh, oh.

5318
03:29:27,400 --> 03:29:28,700
Maybe this is the slowest one.

5319
03:29:35,100 --> 03:29:35,500
Oh!

5320
03:29:35,500 --> 03:29:35,900
Okay.

5321
03:29:36,860 --> 03:29:37,160
Huh.

5322
03:29:40,330 --> 03:29:40,730
No.

5323
03:29:43,030 --> 03:29:44,170
Oh, there we go.

5324
03:29:47,410 --> 03:29:51,410
I feel like it makes it more difficult, but at the same time, I guess easier.

5325
03:29:51,730 --> 03:29:53,210
I don't know how to describe it.

5326
03:29:53,350 --> 03:29:55,930
Because I'm like, you have to time it exactly with the click, you know?

5327
03:30:01,630 --> 03:30:02,750
Oh, ow, ow!

5328
03:30:02,970 --> 03:30:05,170
I pressed the wrong button.

5329
03:30:06,970 --> 03:30:10,450
I've played Oblivion for almost a thousand hours and never lockpicked like that.

5330
03:30:10,690 --> 03:30:13,390
I guess I just really like this mini game since it's never bothered me.

5331
03:30:13,570 --> 03:30:14,930
It's not bothering me.

5332
03:30:16,370 --> 03:30:19,050
I'm just still learning how to do it.

5333
03:30:28,830 --> 03:30:29,390
Oops.

5334
03:30:42,610 --> 03:30:43,170
Okay.

5335
03:30:45,570 --> 03:30:46,530
Maybe that one.

5336
03:30:48,510 --> 03:30:52,290
You can get a skeleton key and I'm breaking lockpick from a shrine.

5337
03:30:52,570 --> 03:30:52,650
Oh.

5338
03:30:55,670 --> 03:30:57,150
This is the stream now.

5339
03:30:57,890 --> 03:30:59,830
Seeing what's in his big chest.

5340
03:31:00,050 --> 03:31:01,130
And then I'll reload.

5341
03:31:07,350 --> 03:31:09,410
One, two, three, go!

5342
03:31:14,080 --> 03:31:17,220
It's a piece of meat, his prized meat, you think?

5343
03:31:56,950 --> 03:31:59,190
I can't!

5344
03:31:59,630 --> 03:32:02,870
Beep bop beep bop beep bop!

5345
03:32:13,460 --> 03:32:15,340
Oh, just two more.

5346
03:32:20,920 --> 03:32:23,240
This is why alteration magic is superior.

5347
03:32:23,540 --> 03:32:24,640
I don't even know what that is.

5348
03:32:24,800 --> 03:32:29,980
So, if you're trying to offend me, I am ignorant to your offense.

5349
03:32:50,330 --> 03:32:55,570
On feet, I don't think I am just a little bit late.

5350
03:32:55,930 --> 03:32:57,590
Three, two, one, go.

5351
03:33:07,850 --> 03:33:10,650
Maybe if I go from the other side, it'll feel a little...

5352
03:33:12,830 --> 03:33:15,030
It'll feel, you know...

5353
03:33:19,290 --> 03:33:21,430
Three, two, one, pick.

5354
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:49,700
That one guard that's been watching you try and pick this lock for...

5355
03:33:49,700 --> 03:33:51,100
What do you mean, the one guard?

5356
03:33:54,320 --> 03:33:55,480
Nobody's watching me.

5357
03:33:56,400 --> 03:33:57,920
Inside, there's like a camera.

5358
03:33:58,140 --> 03:34:00,460
Actually, inside, I open it up and there's the guard.

5359
03:34:02,220 --> 03:34:02,640
Oh,

5360
03:34:15,500 --> 03:34:17,840
I hope... Oh gosh, you guys, I feel like I'm gonna fumble this.

5361
03:34:20,160 --> 03:34:21,000
Careful, SpongeBob!

5362
03:34:22,640 --> 03:34:23,480
The pressure!

5363
03:34:23,900 --> 03:34:28,900
Oh my god, it's like when you're trying to defuse a bomb and they're just like, okay, don't cut the green wire.

5364
03:34:29,100 --> 03:34:31,000
And all you hear is green wire.

5365
03:34:42,330 --> 03:34:43,110
First try!

5366
03:34:45,670 --> 03:34:50,090
Oh, it's just a bunch of weapons.

5367
03:34:55,130 --> 03:34:56,490
I picked it, though.

5368
03:34:57,750 --> 03:34:59,170
I picked it, though.

5369
03:35:00,150 --> 03:35:01,810
Yes, sir-y, I did.

5370
03:35:02,270 --> 03:35:04,390
And with that, you guys, I'm gonna call it a night.

5371
03:35:05,850 --> 03:35:07,990
Next stream, we will kill the other people.

5372
03:35:08,750 --> 03:35:10,030
In the middle of the night.

5373
03:35:11,010 --> 03:35:13,230
I'll kill them, and I'll collect my riches.

5374
03:35:13,590 --> 03:35:15,750
And then we'll be on our merry way.

5375
03:35:15,750 --> 03:35:18,050
Um, to...

5376
03:35:18,050 --> 03:35:20,010
Uh, get my horse back.

5377
03:35:22,270 --> 03:35:23,610
Get my horse!

5378
03:35:23,910 --> 03:35:25,750
And also...

5379
03:35:27,370 --> 03:35:28,030
Um...

5380
03:35:28,870 --> 03:35:29,530
Also...

5381
03:35:30,610 --> 03:35:31,270
Um...

5382
03:35:31,270 --> 03:35:32,810
Oh, the...

5383
03:35:32,810 --> 03:35:34,070
The death guild.

5384
03:35:35,030 --> 03:35:35,890
Hard save?

5385
03:35:35,890 --> 03:35:36,550
I already did.

5386
03:35:38,770 --> 03:35:40,870
Or, yeah, hard saved earlier.

5387
03:35:41,690 --> 03:35:42,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5388
03:35:44,130 --> 03:35:45,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5389
03:35:47,510 --> 03:35:47,910
Oh.

5390
03:35:49,450 --> 03:35:49,850
Oh.

5391
03:35:50,990 --> 03:35:51,770
Oh, yeah.

5392
03:35:53,290 --> 03:35:53,890
Get to you!

5393
03:35:54,210 --> 03:35:55,290
Thank you so much for the 20 gift.

5394
03:35:55,390 --> 03:35:55,870
Thank you.

5395
03:35:57,490 --> 03:35:57,890
Hmm.

5396
03:35:59,230 --> 03:35:59,630
Yes.

5397
03:36:01,650 --> 03:36:03,830
Well, thank you, guys, for a stream.

5398
03:36:04,050 --> 03:36:04,590
This was fine.

5399
03:36:04,770 --> 03:36:05,450
Thanks for the fun stream.

5400
03:36:05,550 --> 03:36:05,930
Thank you!

5401
03:36:07,230 --> 03:36:07,710
And...

5402
03:36:07,710 --> 03:36:09,030
I have no stream tomorrow.

5403
03:36:09,790 --> 03:36:10,790
Um, but...

5404
03:36:10,790 --> 03:36:11,410
I...

5405
03:36:11,410 --> 03:36:13,970
The day after, we'll be more oblivion.

5406
03:36:16,410 --> 03:36:16,890
So...

5407
03:36:16,890 --> 03:36:17,450
We'll...

5408
03:36:17,450 --> 03:36:19,370
We'll just pick up where we...

5409
03:36:20,190 --> 03:36:21,110
Left off.

5410
03:36:21,530 --> 03:36:22,490
Pick another chest.

5411
03:36:22,710 --> 03:36:23,350
No, it's okay.

5412
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:25,150
Because we're not even keeping this save.

5413
03:36:25,730 --> 03:36:26,670
I picked that...

5414
03:36:26,670 --> 03:36:28,810
I picked this chest just to see if I could do it.

5415
03:36:29,050 --> 03:36:29,310
Hahaha.

5416
03:36:29,730 --> 03:36:31,410
Just because I wanted to say that I could.

5417
03:36:31,630 --> 03:36:31,910
But...

5418
03:36:31,910 --> 03:36:33,190
We're not keeping this save.

5419
03:36:33,370 --> 03:36:34,330
We're, uh...

5420
03:36:34,970 --> 03:36:36,270
We're doing this...

5421
03:36:36,270 --> 03:36:36,890
Oh, no.

5422
03:36:37,090 --> 03:36:38,230
This is the autosave.

5423
03:36:38,370 --> 03:36:39,410
We're doing...

5424
03:36:41,470 --> 03:36:41,870
This...

5425
03:36:41,870 --> 03:36:43,010
This one.

5426
03:36:43,630 --> 03:36:44,030
Hahaha.

5427
03:36:44,550 --> 03:36:45,650
We're doing this one.

5428
03:36:47,630 --> 03:36:48,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5429
03:36:48,910 --> 03:36:49,610
This one.

5430
03:36:49,930 --> 03:36:51,130
This is the one that...

5431
03:36:51,130 --> 03:36:51,790
We didn't...

5432
03:36:51,790 --> 03:36:53,710
We're not gonna snitch to him and we're gonna...

5433
