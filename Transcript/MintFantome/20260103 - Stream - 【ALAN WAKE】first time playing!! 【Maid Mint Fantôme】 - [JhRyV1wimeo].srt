1
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,950
Wait, wait, wait.

3
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,130
Wait, wait, wait.

4
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,090
MOUBOO!

5
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,170
Kairi no-sai-maseen!

6
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,470
Go-shin-Ninya-mao, Go-in-yoo, rever-wo-go!

7
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,810
Hello, hello, welcome in, welcome in!

8
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,370
Welcome into...

9
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,390
Aoi and Wake!

10
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,030
Woo!

11
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,310
Boo, bo, bo, bo, bo!

12
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,090
I think there's not like a spoilers on this, right?

13
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,250
You know how some, like, Openings kind of have like a...

14
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,610
Hey, don't watch this unless you've played the game already.

15
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,210
Alan wake up!

16
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,250
Alan wake up!

17
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,610
Did you decide to play this because its creator is
considered the European Kojima?

18
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,550
No, I decided to play this because everybody said that Alan
Wake 2 is so good and that's all I wanted to play.

19
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,670
I had no idea.

20
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,770
I had no idea.

21
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,630
I have zero idea what this game is about, you guys.

22
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,890
I literally know nothing.

23
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,410
I am going in, like, 100% blind, basically.

24
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,030
I did zero research.

25
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,870
So...

26
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,430
Please try to avoid spoilers and all that.

27
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:12,110
We're going to implement the smiley method, where if anybody
sees spoilers in the chat, please do a smiley face so that I

28
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,330
do not see it.

29
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:20,250
If I see a smiley face, that tells me that I should not look
at chat and that also pushes the spoiler off the screen so

30
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,930
that it gets no attention.

31
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,650
It's my foolproof method.

32
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,210
Hello, Mito and Ibu is like you.

33
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,190
I wish upon every Ibu good health and many blessings this
year.

34
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:30,830
Love you.

35
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,070
Ah, Kamu, thank you.

36
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,730
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

37
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,150
I don't know.

38
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:40,130
Good system.

39
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:43,890
Yeah, it seriously has been like the best system yet.

40
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:54,490
Because like I said, not only does it push the spoiler off
the screen, out of chat so I don't read it, it also alerts

41
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,050
me that I should not be looking.

42
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,330
Oh my gosh, right before stream, I went to go get...

43
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,930
It was during the loading stream.

44
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,690
It's just loading screen.

45
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,070
I went to go get some tea.

46
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:13,750
And I saw Paz running around, and she loves to, like, hide
in my room.

47
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:17,950
And I go back into my room, and I was like, there better not
be a little girl in here.

48
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,350
Paz is my cat, by the way.

49
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,270
I'm like, there better not be a little girl in here.

50
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,630
And then I check behind the curtain, and there was a little
girl, but I had already shut my door.

51
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,750
And so she was, like, freaking out because she just went to
the bathroom, so she had the zoomies.

52
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:44,730
She goes to run outside my door, and she sees that it's
shut, and so she's like, what do I do?

53
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:52,490
And so she freaks out, and, and, and turns around really
fast and booked her head on the wall.

54
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,710
Payment for the slap earlier.

55
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,390
Thank you, Minto.

56
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,230
I needed it.

57
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:58,890
Kapo!

58
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:01,710
Kapo.

59
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
Be happy.

60
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,180
It's okay.

61
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,900
It's all okay.

62
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,100
I'm so happy to see you getting a start in the Remedy
universe.

63
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,080
Is that what it's called?

64
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,420
Alan Wake is a fantastic foothold into Sam Lake's dog shit.

65
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,440
Affectionate.

66
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,160
Who's Sam?

67
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Wait, what are...

68
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,540
What is...

69
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,080
What's happening?

70
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,620
Today's my birthday today!

71
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,620
I can't think of a better way to spend it than by watching
Minky!

72
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,620
Oh gosh, see my happy birthday!

73
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,220
Happy, happy birthday!

74
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,460
Happy, happy birthday, happy birthday!

75
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,130
Sorry for being in the comment that tipped the tear bucket
yesterday.

76
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,430
No!

77
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,090
It's totally okay.

78
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,230
Totally A-okay.

79
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,330
Do Smiley's a random plot point, so Minto always questions
what could possibly be spoiler- No!

80
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,590
Don't do that!

81
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:12,950
Don't do that!

82
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:20,810
Just do smileys.

83
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,390
I mean, you could if I start trying to like guess stuff, you
could do smileys.

84
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,970
Don't ever confirm or deny nothing.

85
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,130
Confirm nor deny nothing.

86
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,730
That's like confirming something is like a big spoiler.

87
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:40,770
Oh, I don't know.

88
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,630
Am I alone in thinking that way?

89
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,030
Always smiling.

90
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,630
ABS, always be smiling.

91
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,070
Alan Wake is about Alan who's awake.

92
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,630
I don't know, I've never played the game.

93
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,490
Me neither.

94
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,010
Well, he's clearly awake in, like, all of these.

95
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,170
Oh, sure.

96
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:57,950
Oh, my gosh.

97
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,590
Thank you so much for the 15th of day.

98
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,550
Thank you.

99
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,850
Um, but what was I gonna say?

100
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,830
Oh, people would make fun of me sometimes because I would
make up, or I would make up.

101
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:28,530
make I would I would mix up Alan Wake and John Wick because
okay you have to be you have to understand now all I saw was

102
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:37,850
Alan Wake too that guy looks exactly like John Wick and so
in my brain there I had so that's also partially why I

103
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:49,750
wanted to play because I finally watched Alan Wake and now
I'm finally no sorry wait no I just did it again I finally

104
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,150
played John Wick.

105
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,090
No, wait, I did it again.

106
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,810
I finally...

107
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:57,350
I

108
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,120
finally watched John Wick.

109
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,180
And now I'm finally playing Alan Wick.

110
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,200
And so hopefully I won't get them confused anymore.

111
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,040
I can't get him right.

112
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,460
Oh my god.

113
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Get him right.

114
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,320
Oh.

115
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,360
Oh, geez.

116
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,620
Also, I got Alan Wake this one and the second one when they
were free on Epic Store.

117
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,140
So, yippee.

118
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,880
Also, thank you guys for the super chat.

119
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,180
Sorry.

120
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,360
I was...

121
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
I was...

122
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,080
Did you know Alan Wake isn't his...

123
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,640
Don't say that.

124
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't...

125
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,120
That's his real name.

126
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,440
Love my dyslexic Oshi into assassin slash author dudes.

127
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,270
That's our Vtuber.

128
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,510
It's your theme music.

129
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,490
What's the theme music?

130
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,610
His real name is John Wick.

131
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:34,890
Oh...

132
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,070
I think you're confused.

133
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,990
You're like Alan Wick and John Wake again.

134
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,390
Wait.

135
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:40,670
Alan...

136
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,350
No, it's Alan Wake and John Wick.

137
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,130
Wait, no!

138
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,830
You're confusing me!

139
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,430
Wait, it's Alan Wake!

140
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,070
It says it right there on the title.

141
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,410
And John Wick.

142
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,670
Don't do this to me!

143
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,220
Don't do this to me!

144
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,340
Alan Wick.

145
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,500
No, Alan Wake.

146
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,900
Alan Wake up.

147
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,860
Can't wake up.

148
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,580
John Wick.

149
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,540
Punch you in the dick.

150
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,700
I think that's how I'll remember.

151
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,760
Because John Wick will be upset that you killed the dog.

152
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,220
I think that's how I'll remember.

153
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,920
I have to think of something else for Alan Wake though.

154
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,720
This is how I found your Kamiyoshi in 2022.

155
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,760
She was playing Alan Wake on Twitch.

156
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,160
And this is how I fell down the VTuber Rabbit Hole.

157
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,120
Henya!

158
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,640
Alan's the monster.

159
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,040
Wake is the scientist.

160
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,680
Dr. Allen and Wake Hyde.

161
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,540
Keanu Reeves' real name.

162
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,160
Keanu Reeves.

163
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,620
I feel like that has to be his real name.

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,560
That's like such a specific name.

165
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,260
Keanu Reeves.

166
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,680
I'm Googling it.

167
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,840
Real name.

168
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,800
I was right.

169
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,720
I was right.

170
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,320
I was right.

171
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,100
I don't think you'll ever be able to get rid of the John
Wake.

172
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,540
No, John Wake!

173
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,200
Sam Lake is head of Remedy and made the games.

174
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,620
Ah, he's also the face of Maxpan.

175
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:24,580
Oh!

176
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,600
I live two hours away from Remedy's HQ where this game was
made.

177
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,560
Oh my gosh, cool!

178
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,780
So cool!

179
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,980
The actual name is Neo.

180
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,660
Ouch, oh my gosh, I might not be able to wear my...

181
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,280
headphones today.

182
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,260
I might have to switch out.

183
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,000
I think they're online.

184
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,720
I think I scratched my ear earlier and it made a cut.

185
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm gonna switch to my big headphones.

186
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:58,780
One second.

187
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,150
Today, today, today, today.

188
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,050
Oh, I also gotta get my controller.

189
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,730
This is a controller game, right?

190
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,670
I'm like assuming this is a controller game, right?

191
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,250
La la la, can you hear me?

192
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:20,910
Wait, I did it.

193
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,970
Unplugged my mic, I unplugged my headphones.

194
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,730
Hopefully Alan Wake doesn't go after them nuts or your
method will be ruined.

195
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,850
You're so right.

196
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,370
Oh my gosh, what if that's his signature move?

197
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,110
Amito just got home from the mall.

198
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,330
Did I miss anything?

199
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,870
Uh, we're about to wake up, A.B.

200
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,150
His real name is Frank Yeager and Yeager is driven for Wake.

201
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:51,030
Alan Wake, bake you a cake.

202
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,410
John Wick, punch you in the dick.

203
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,210
Where's my controller?

204
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,270
Alright.

205
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:10,270
Wait, yeah, if this guy is considered European Kojima, is
this a movie game?

206
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,430
I love that.

207
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,870
Windows jump scare.

208
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,470
Sorry, that was me grabbing my controller.

209
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,890
This guy you play as a guy and he's a dude.

210
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,490
Spoiler.

211
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,550
Press any key to play Bum

212
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,700
Does the game seem quiet here guys Shall we start?

213
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:44,420
Very excited to say Mito start this This game Very Twin
Peaks, very Twilight Zone Ooh, I'm so excited Mystery in

214
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:55,860
Adventure Hall It's not quiet Really Okay, cool Let's go
then Oh, is this game difficult?

215
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:00,280
Would you guys say, what would you say is normal okay to do
for me?

216
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,820
This isn't a movie game.

217
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,960
This is a book game.

218
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,020
My name is Alan Wake and I'm a writer.

219
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,400
Normal is fine?

220
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,560
Okay, okay, okay.

221
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,620
I think normal is fine.

222
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,320
Okay.

223
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,920
Alan, it's time to wake up.

224
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,140
Alan, wake up.

225
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,900
Let's wake up.

226
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:30,480
Stephen King once wrote that nightmares exist outside of
logic, and there's little fun to be had in explanations.

227
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,900
Wait, do I need some- They're antithetical to the poetry of
fear.

228
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,460
Can I put on subtitles?

229
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,660
In a horror story, the victim keeps asking why, but there
can be no explanation.

230
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,460
I don't want to press start in case it skips it.

231
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,320
The unanswered mystery is what stays with us the longest,
and it's what we'll remember in the end.

232
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,460
My name is Alan Wake.

233
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,480
And he's a writer.

234
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:48,920
I'm a writer.

235
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,420
Ah!

236
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,600
Ah!

237
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:03,940
I've always had a vivid imagination, but this dream
unsettled me.

238
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,720
It was wild and dark and weird, even by my standards.

239
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,000
Even by your standards.

240
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:09,840
What are your standards?

241
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,420
So yes, it began with the dream.

242
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,680
Super chat writer.

243
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,540
Alan, wake up, girl.

244
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:23,000
Following a typical nightmare pattern, I was late,
desperately trying to reach my destination a lighthouse for

245
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,480
some urgent reason i couldn't remember i've been driving too
fast down a coastal road to get there oh my god that's scary

246
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:39,280
oh my god be safe wait this is the dream right i've seen the
hitchhiker too late why was he standing in the middle of the

247
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,900
road though

248
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:52,560
he was dead i was convinced they'd put me in jail and i
would never see alice again Alice.

249
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,840
Your lights.

250
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,560
Oh my god, Alan, wake up!

251
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,760
Alan, wake up!

252
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,160
Alan, wake up!

253
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,460
It's just a dream!

254
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:06,960
Draco's, thank you so much for the time.

255
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,060
He gets a thank you!

256
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,580
Suddenly, his body was gone.

257
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,620
Episode 1, Nightmare.

258
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,240
Whoa!

259
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,780
I was in shock from the crash.

260
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,680
I could hardly stand my feet.

261
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,780
Okay, give me one second, I'm going to...

262
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:24,980
Oh!

263
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,360
Look to the...

264
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:26,500
Wait.

265
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,200
R...

266
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,120
Okay, turns the camera.

267
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,940
Look up to the light.

268
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,500
Reverse your...

269
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,720
No, I think...

270
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,940
I'm actually one of those people that like...

271
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,600
If I press up, I like to look up.

272
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,220
So...

273
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,840
No, I'm okay.

274
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,600
You can change camera settings in the menu's option screen.

275
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,580
Okay, one second.

276
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,020
Let's see if there is subtitles enabled.

277
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,840
Sorry about that, everybody.

278
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,920
So sorry.

279
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,560
Also one second.

280
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,160
Let's do that.

281
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,520
Up is up.

282
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,900
Yes, yes, yes.

283
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,560
Andrew goes, did I say thank you?

284
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,180
I said it in my brain.

285
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,340
Thank you so much for the tori genta.

286
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:07,940
Thank you.

287
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,620
I don't know if I said it out loud.

288
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,020
Please, no, thank you.

289
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,720
And Ralph Walgood, welcome back.

290
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,540
Thank you.

291
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,000
I like to imagine that this guy does voiceover for
everything.

292
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,780
I woke up and went to the kitchen.

293
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,460
I ran out of orange juice.

294
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,220
So true.

295
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,000
Alright, here we go.

296
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,860
There we go.

297
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,840
Oh, do I need to make the font size?

298
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
We'll do it like this.

299
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,300
That should be good.

300
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:40,940
Oh.

301
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,080
He walks so funny.

302
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
LB, the sprint.

303
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,340
Oh.

304
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,440
That's a funny button, the sprint.

305
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,820
Drop hazard.

306
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,780
Drop hazard.

307
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:04,860
hazard of blah blah blah's called drop the beat now I had to
go to the lighthouse I knew there was something important

308
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:12,860
waiting for me there get to the lighthouse oh did that just
give me wait what is what's the red thing up there wait I'm

309
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:18,300

make the font a little smaller because I'm gonna be blocking

310
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:25,680
it quite a bit so we'll make it like that I think probably
this is the remaster well it was the only one that I had on

311
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:38,360
up on my epic store so they're like hey idiot the lighthouse
is over there what's over here though the bridge is out the

312
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:48,260
bridge had collapsed I'd have to find another way to the
lighthouse pick up coffee thermos collectible okay that's

313
00:21:48,260 --> 00:22:04,030
fun narration is kind of sending me the the sensitivity on
the camera is look at that it's kind of insane I'm not gonna

314
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:11,690
lie holy cow it's gonna take some getting used to actually
all of these controls are gonna take it's very it's like

315
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:26,100
slow and sensitive at the same time oh shoot wait I was
gonna read that though ah you don't even recognize me do you

316
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:30,540
writer you think you're God oh shoot Oh, she did.

317
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,640
Well, maybe she did.

318
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,040
Oh,

319
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,560
uh, maybe I should run.

320
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,040
Maybe I should run.

321
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,060
What's this?

322
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:44,840
Missing.

323
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,940
There's a robot and a QR code.

324
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,880
Maybe I should run.

325
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,660
A to jump.

326
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:50,480
E!

327
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,060
Oh my god!

328
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,020
It's like I'm actually running in a dream.

329
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,720
It's kind of insane.

330
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,140
You missed your deadline!

331
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,740
You can dodge enemy attacks.

332
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,340
LBLS to dodge.

333
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,320
Okay.

334
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:00,980
Ah!

335
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,780
You can't stop me!

336
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Can I punch?

337
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,160
Try it again.

338
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,020
Dodge the attack.

339
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,180
Where'd he go?

340
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,980
I realized that the hitchhiker was a character from the
story I've been working on.

341
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,000
Funny.

342
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,080
Run, Minto.

343
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:22,940
I was.

344
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,720
I was running.

345
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,420
Can I get back over there?

346
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Look at the way he jumps.

347
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,200
Safety!

348
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,040
Welcome back!

349
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,140
Thank you!

350
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,360
Rider Dodge.

351
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:37,740
Woo!

352
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:40,220
Woo!

353
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,120
Woo!

354
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,240
Woo!

355
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,060
Woo!

356
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,480
Oh!

357
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:48,900

Stop.

373
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Two bullets and a dream.

374
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,880
Oh my god!

375
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,420
Clay Stewart!

376
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,120
I was trapped.

377
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
There was no way out.

378
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,040
Uh, I can hide in here.

379
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,020
Oh, I can just push the whole...

380
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,380
I can push the whole ass everything.

381
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,560
Move the bed.

382
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,160
What's happening?

383
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,780
Can I push this?

384
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,560
Oh my god.

385
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
I had to get out.

386
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
Um...

387
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,040
How do I get out?

388
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,480
Whoa!

389
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,840
If I could, um...

390
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,320
Whoa!

391
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:09,700
Ouch!

392
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,900
Wait, hold on.

393
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,740
Follow the light.

394
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:17,980
Okay.

395
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,860
Hmm.

396
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,700
I'm running?

397
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,240
Oh, that's...

398
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:38,740
you should go into the light you are only safe there oh yeah

399
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:48,100

did not know that beyond the lake he called home lies a

400
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:58,720
deeper darker ocean green where waves are both wilder and
more serene to its ports i've been to its ports i've been

401
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,840
being do you understand to its ports i've been

402
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:20,400
to its ports i've been i entered your dream to teach you the
darkness is dangerous it's sleeping now when it feels you

only show you the most important thing the hidden Each hiker

404
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,940
has been taken over by the dark presence.

405
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,640
You can't hurt him now.

406
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,320
The darkness protects him from all harm.

407
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,520
Only light can drive the darkness away and make him
vulnerable again.

408
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,080
Here, take the light.

409
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm trying, but it's only telling me to get the...

410
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,420
I'm focusing?

411
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:45,880
Pick up the flashlight.

412
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:46,560
Oh, sorry.

413
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,860
I thought that was the flashlight.

414
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:48,820
Okay, yes, sir.

415
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,620
Turn your flashlight toward him and burn the darkness away.

416
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,320
Whoa.

417
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,790
You did it.

418
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,490
Now the darkness no longer protects him, but it's still
inside, controlling him.

419
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,650
He can't be saved.

420
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:15,870
He's still a threat.

421
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,250
He is still your enemy.

422
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:17,750
Yeah?

423
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,010
Here, take the gun.

424
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,850
The gun.

425
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,650
Oh, shoot.

426
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,910
A revolver!

427
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,310
Pick up the revolver.

428
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:24,830
Okay!

429
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,210
My goodness!

430
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,330
Uh, uh, there it is.

431
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,470
Okay, I'm seeing...

432
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,690
Now you'll die.

433
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,850
RT the fire.

434
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,290
Oh, oh, shoot.

435
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:35,950
Heck yeah.

436
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,790
I jumped.

437
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,050
How do I...

438
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:39,390
Oh, okay.

439
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,830
I, like, get him, and then I shoot him.

440
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,090
Interesting.

441
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,210
I'll reload.

442
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:50,510
Oh!

443
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:54,570
Oh.

444
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,310
Oh, shoot.

445
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,030
Ah, bubba.

446
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:58,450
Oh, ouch.

447
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:00,350
Oh.

448
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:00,930
Ah!

449
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:01,390
Ah!

450
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:02,450
Ouch!

451
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,190
Oh my gosh.

452
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,330
I keep jumping instead of dodging.

453
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,590
Good.

454
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:25,830
You've done well.

455
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,350
Remember what I've taught you.

456
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,710
Thank you.

457
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:28,270
That is all.

458
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,330
I will give you back your dream now.

459
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,400
A terrible darkness was taking over the world.

460
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,080
The lighthouse was the last safe place on Earth.

461
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,820
Okay.

462
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,260
Let's grab all that we can get now here.

463
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,620
Oh, I didn't limit reach.

464
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,220
But I have no more battery.

465
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,400
I hope that's okay.

466
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,920
The last safe place ever, ever.

467
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:00,740
Oh, shoot.

468
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,240
You're back?

469
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,300
I just killed you, though.

470
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,040
Oh, shoot.

471
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,520
That's real.

472
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,420
Yeah!

473
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,570

00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,130
Okay, cool.

I'm running.

476
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,490

Oh shoot, I'm gonna die for real.

It's running in slow motion for real.

499
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:38,690
I'm running in my dream.

500
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:40,790

00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,160
Uh oh.

515
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,600
Certified Hood Clash.

516
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,410
He's here.

517
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,410

00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,850
Oh, they said it.

520
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,670
Shh, baby.

521
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,010
Just another nightmare.

522
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,790
Everything's fine.

523
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,110
You dozed off.

524
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:51,890
Right.

525
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:52,950
Alice?

526
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,170
More than dozed off would be news for everyone.

527
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:56,350
Oh.

528
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,130
Cheer up, handsome.

Welcome to Bright Falls.

533
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,930
Wow, wow, this place is nice.

00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:19,850
So pretty.

535
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,190
These spaces are updated and still look crazy.

536
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,670
I didn't research if the remaster was any good or not, so...

537
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,250
Fingies crossed, I suppose.

538
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,130
Oh, we're too late now, maybe.

539
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,670
The facial animations in this game were always a little
goofy.

00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:43,850
I think I can handle it, ma'am.

713
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:45,270
I didn't want to wait.

714
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,730
I wanted to find Stucky.

715
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,170
To get the key and get out as soon as possible.

716
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,350
The waitress was giving me a headache.

717
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,310
Overheaker fans always did.

718
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:54,970
Wait, what do you mean die?

719
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:56,430
Why am I gonna die in here?

720
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,450
It's just a bathroom, no?

721
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:02,950
Wait, it's really dark.

722
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:06,230
Mr. Stucky?

723
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,790
Mr. Stucky?

724
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:09,850
I'm Stucky?

725
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,350
It's probably fine.

726
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:28,370

wife How'd you know my mom on my wife?

730
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:51,270

00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:54,890
Oh Thanks are you gonna hit on her?

732
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:56,770
She's happily married.

735
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:21,050
You got lucky this time, young man.

736
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,530
You can hurt yourself in the dark.

737
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,750
This really ought to be fixed.

738
00:46:26,090 --> 00:46:30,690
And then I must remind Sarah to change the lights of the
station that's been too long already.

739
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,210
I think I'm going to become... if I ever...

740
00:46:33,210 --> 00:46:36,330
Well, I can't grow old because, you know, I'm...

741
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,110
Are they asleep?

742
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,710
Even that sounds better when you're singing.

743
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:40,610
Are you alright?

744
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,670
Can I turn this off?

745
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,810
Turn it off!

746
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:52,250
Audio jungle!

747
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:53,970
Audio jungle!

748
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,230
Everybody's talking to me!

749
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,650
Oh my god!

750
00:47:00,670 --> 00:47:02,550
We're waiting for Dr. Hartman to come pick them up.

751
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:05,270
They wandered off from his clinic at the Calvin Lake Lodge.

752
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:05,710
Oh!

753
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:07,310
Really awesome.

754
00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:09,170
Oh, is that my wife?

755
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,290
My hot wife?

756
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,090
Goodbye!

757
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,430
I'll be heading back to work as soon as Dr. Hartman gets
here, Rose.

758
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:23,550
Oh, but I'm not looking forward to the poison we have at the
Park Cafe.

759
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:27,410
I'm famous.

760
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,230
I know, but only she knows who I am.

761
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:31,050
This is what coffee should taste.

762
00:47:31,070 --> 00:47:37,450
Well, what I was saying was about if I, you know, were to
ever grow old, but I'm a ghost, so I'm forever 19.

763
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,870
But if I were to ever grow old, I think I would be like that
lady.

764
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,110
I'm so scared of the dark.

765
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:43,130
I think I would also...

766
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:56,770
wake the dearest dear thank you thank you mission

nut house oh I guess the the directions that she gave would
you believe this place oh this would make a wonderful

770
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:30,850
setting for a book we're supposed to be on vacation Alice
I'll figure it out when we get back okay okay we can talk

771
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:38,230
about this later no way that the creepy old lady I didn't
want to talk about it I wanted to bury my head in sand

772
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:44,030
there's another one of my favorites to go with Once upon a
time, I was a successful writer, but that was a long time

773
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:44,370
ago.

774
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,590
I hadn't been able to write a word in two years, not since
my last book.

775
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:50,010
That's not that long, though.

776
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:51,170
Right?

777
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,630
I mean, I don't think anybody's expecting a writer to put
out a book a year or anything, right?

778
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:00,330
Like, I thought he was going to say, like, 10 years.

779
00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:04,610
It gets pretty dark out here, but they'll light your way.

780
00:49:08,590 --> 00:49:09,850
Is this going to give me DMCA?

781
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,150
I give up already.

782
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:19,570
Mint Stucky, don't worry, step bro.

783
00:49:20,770 --> 00:49:22,630
Wait, this place is so nice.

784
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:28,490
A diver's aisle.

785
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:29,330
I almost said...

786
00:49:29,330 --> 00:49:29,730
Don't worry, honey.

787
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:32,310
I'll get you inside safe and sound before it gets dark.

788
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:33,690
And I've got the flashlight.

789
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:34,690
I know.

790
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:35,790
I'm okay.

791
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,270
Alice had a phobia.

792
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:38,870
The fear of darkness.

793
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:39,350
Me too.

794
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:42,150
I wanted to make sure we were inside with the lights on
before Sunday.

795
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:45,750
Oh my god everybody's afraid of the dark.

796
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,690
I relate to everybody.

797
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,710
Oh well, spooky.

798
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,350
Any long-haired maidens in there?

799
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:02,590
Well, well.

800
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:04,410
Well.

801
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:10,330
Now this place is nice, but it's kind of spooky that there's
like no one around here, no?

802
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:14,830
What about the deer festival?

803
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,160
Bird leg cabin.

804
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,020
Bird legs.

805
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,260
There's birds everywhere.

806
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,240
Birds cabin.

807
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:29,440
Birds took over the cabin.

808
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,120
What was...

809
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,420
Okay, a basement.

810
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,220
Music is so somber.

811
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,280
I'm just checking it out.

812
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,900
Seeing what we got around here.

813
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,700
There's so many birds!

814
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:58,560
the island had once been the site for a love story maybe it
would be that again maybe I hadn't written a word in two

815
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:06,740
years brother people still like G R R Martin and look at him
nothing for 15 years I know right isn't Game of Thrones

816
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:14,960

of how what was it there was that one author an old

817
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:22,640
generator had been connected to the power cable there was
that one author that didn't write it was like a manga car he

818
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:36,220

playing idol master or something oh oh yeah let there be

819
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:40,280

around a bit sure thing was that him have fun Oh, oh.

821
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,810
I didn't get to look inside that.

822
00:51:58,890 --> 00:51:59,390
It was a beautiful place.

823
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,870
I told myself I could rest here.

824
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:04,350
Sleep here.

825
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,030
And forget about my work.

826
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,510
Well, he did pass away, didn't he?

827
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:08,370
Oh, my gosh.

828
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:10,570
I forgot about that.

829
00:52:11,210 --> 00:52:12,710
I thought we could be happy here.

830
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,970
Return to Alice.

831
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:18,070
Okay.

832
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,850
Return to my beautiful wife.

833
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:22,230
Alice.

834
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:23,930
Alice, my wife.

835
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,030
Don't touch the windows.

836
00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:29,150
We don't know how often this place is clean.

837
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,050
Uh-oh.

838
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,310
Spooky music's starting.

839
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:35,070
Alice?

840
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,050
Honey?

841
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:39,210
You mean our wife?

842
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,910
Alice takes off her shoes.

843
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:45,810
Um, hello, Mr. Stomping around in the mud out there.

844
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:49,390
Have some tact, please.

845
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,010
Ah!

846
00:52:50,310 --> 00:52:50,950
A thermos.

847
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,130
I can't believe I missed that one.

848
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,250
I'm so...

849
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,390
Alan, I'm upstairs.

850
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,010
I have a surprise for you.

851
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:06,010
Didn't she say consider this our honeymoon?

852
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,530
Let's turn that off because it's scary.

853
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,530
Wait, let's turn on.

854
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:11,730
No, turn off.

855
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,430
Turn off the creepy radio.

856
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:16,190
Oh.

857
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:19,130
Oh.

858
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,470
Just ran into one on the ferry.

859
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,310
Famous artist, no less.

860
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:22,890
Oh.

861
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,150
We'll see if we can rope him into an interview later on.

862
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:25,950
Excuse you?

863
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:27,690
Keep me on the DL!

864
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:29,530
Hi, Pat.

865
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:30,110
It's Rose.

866
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:30,670
Oh, my God.

867
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,670
Oh, no.

868
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:32,490
What's on your mind?

869
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,270
I know who that famous artist was.

870
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,650
It was Alan Wake.

871
00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:37,870
Rose, you snitch!

872
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:38,950
Well, Rose, I...

873
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:40,410
I just saw him at the diner.

874
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:42,690
Oh, I am so excited.

875
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:43,290
He's here.

876
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:45,430
I'm sure he's glad to be here, too.

877
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:47,890
Well, folks, I guess the secret's out.

878
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:48,990
This is Pat Main.

879
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:50,190
I'm KBFFM.

880
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:51,430
And now it's the music.

881
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,130
Great.

882
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:53,890
So much for keeping a low profile.

883
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,730
Oh, my God.

884
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:56,690
Can't turn it off.

885
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,070
No?

886
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,110
Ha ha ha!

887
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:04,560
Yeah!

888
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,700
Way to go, Rose.

889
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,740
Oh my gosh.

890
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,800
Never trust a Rose in a video game, huh?

891
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:12,400
Alan!

892
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,120
Come here, slow poke.

893
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,100
I'm waiting.

894
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,340
Oh god, we can't keep a maiden waiting now, Kemp.

895
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:26,560
That's some great visual storytelling now, isn't it, folks?

896
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:38,190
Well, hello there.

897
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,810
I'm not the surprise.

898
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:40,970
It's in the study.

899
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:41,730
Oh, what?

900
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:42,650
What do you mean?

901
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:43,870
Okay.

902
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,830
No, come on.

903
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:46,930
You're my wife.

904
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:50,490
And you're dressed like that.

905
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,250
Oh, we're in the 70s.

906
00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:55,050
Oh, okay.

907
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,590
Hey, but...

908
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,470
Come on.

909
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,110
You can't say you're not the surprise when you're like that
in front of me.

910
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,010
Oh, my God.

911
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,010
Surprise.

912
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:14,530
Alice what is this I guess I have a small confession to make
I thought maybe you could write here that a change of

913
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:23,170
scenery would get you damn Alice you everyone hey hey hey
just hear me out there's a local doctor dr. Hartman I read a

914
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:30,290
book of his he has a private clinic here he specializes in
helping artists so now you want to get me committed no it's

915
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:38,470
not like that that's not well Alan Alan I don't want to hear
it.

916
00:55:38,650 --> 00:55:39,750
God damn it, Alice.

917
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:40,430
Wait, what?

918
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:43,270
Wait, did he not notice that the lights turned off for a
second?

919
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,530
I knew she wouldn't follow me in the dark.

920
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,430
I needed some time alone to think things through.

921
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:49,550
Wait, what do you mean?

922
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:50,750
That's so messed up, though.

923
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,580
I mean, I don't blame him for being upset.

924
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,080
I think that's kind of, you know.

925
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:03,780
Damn it.

926
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,660
Alice?

927
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:13,500
Alice?

928
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:14,720
Alice!

929
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:15,940
Alice!

930
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:18,360
Alice!

931
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,340
Alice!

932
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,740
The cabin had gone dark.

933
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,100
All the lights were out.

934
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:23,920
Oh my god.

935
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,320
Where are you?

936
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:26,820
I'm coming!

937
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:27,360
I'm coming!

938
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:29,220
It's actually quite bright up here, no?

939
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:30,700
Oh my god!

940
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,060
I'm coming!

941
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:35,020
Oh my god!

942
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:35,460
What the hell?

943
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,000
Alice!

944
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,280
Help me!

945
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,820
Alice!

946
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,920
Oh my god!

947
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,420
Her screams are...

948
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,640
Oh my god!

949
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,660
Oh, uh...

950
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:51,880
Oh, no.

951
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,460
Wait, that's like...

952
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,040
Oh, no!

953
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,310
Did she hit the rocks on the way down?

954
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,010
Wait, did he hit the rocks on the way down?

955
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:05,990
Oh, no.

956
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:07,670
Keep going, Alice.

957
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:09,890
Wake up.

958
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:11,010
Alice?

959
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:13,710
Oh, no.

960
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,390
This is like the opposite.

961
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:28,670
Opposite of games usually where they tell you to stop
playing the game.

962
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,110
She tells you to keep going.

963
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:30,950
I couldn't remember how I got there.

964
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,350
All I knew was that something terrible had happened to
Alice.

965
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,350
The phone was dead.

966
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,770
I'd have to find help on foot.

967
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,010
Why did we get in the car?

968
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,150
This is part of the dream?

969
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,490
We're back in Dream World?

970
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:53,430
Among Alice's things was...

971
00:57:53,450 --> 00:58:04,010
a book the creator's dilemma by a dr. Emil Hartman I mean oh
no I didn't like it and I didn't like the guy's smug face on

974
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,320

977
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:57,890
Is this- this isn't like a we kill my wife kind of games, is
it?

978
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:01,410
And I'm stuck in a nightmare because of it, is it?

979
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:04,770
What's- Oh, the focus is kind of fun.

980
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:10,830
Saracho, welcome to the membership.

981
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:12,730
Thank you, welcome back.

982
00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:13,330
Hello?

983
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:14,750
Oh, the light!

984
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:16,910
Oh my gosh, it reminds me of the thing.

985
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:18,490
Like the cover for the thing.

986
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:20,690
That's Silent Hill.

987
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,050
I know, I'm just- Well, a lot of games do it now.

988
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:24,450
Someone there?

989
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:38,440
what's it say what is it the loose sheets of paper were
pages from a manuscript entitled departure that was the name

990
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:45,540
i planned to use for the next novel i had never gotten
started i was named the author i hadn't written it i

991
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:51,680
couldn't remember writing it in the scene on the page the
hero was attacked by an axe murderer in the woods at night

992
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:59,520
wait i don't like that um all fiction you found manuscript
pages you can access them with the wait i have to make sure

993
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:00,540
I press the right one.

994
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,420
Is it this button?

995
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:03,140
This button.

996
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:06,860
Wake attacked by a shadowy murderer.

997
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,180
What did... What does that mean?

998
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,060
The little symbol.

999
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:14,700
Oh, find this page in nightmare difficulty mode.

1000
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,680
The man turned to face me.

1001
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:18,720
His face was covered in shadows.

1002
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,500
It was hard to make him out in the darkness of the forest
that surrounded us.

1003
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,760
But the axe he lifted was plain to see.

1004
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,060
It glistened with the blood of his victim.

1005
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,480
He grinned madly.

1006
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:38,860
The shadows were were alive distorting his features it was a
scene from a nightmare but I was awake I was a wake Alan

1007
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:56,080
period wake this doesn't sound good oh wait hold on I want
to what's the title page departure by Alan wake oh that's it

1008
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,520
it's literally it okay

1009
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,480
um is this okay I think this is the right way

1010
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,760
Surely that was...

1011
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,020
Aw, man!

1012
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,500
I was about to say, surely that was...

1013
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:16,520
That won't happen again.

1014
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,440
I don't have a gun!

1015
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,360
Queue emotional outburst.

1016
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:20,180
Oh no!

1017
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:25,810
There's light over there.

1018
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:27,270
Checkpoint reached.

1019
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:29,330
There's a lot of checkpoints in this game.

1020
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,270
It's actually quite forgiving, which is very nice.

1021
01:01:31,450 --> 01:01:32,890
The lights up ahead were a good sign.

1022
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:36,990
Maybe I wouldn't have to hike all the way down to the gas
station to find a phone.

1023
01:01:37,550 --> 01:01:38,870
Narration of this game is great.

1024
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:43,090
Also, I want to do a little bit smaller for the subtitles.

1025
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,570
You're walking in the woods.

1026
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:49,590
There's no one around and your phone is dead.

1027
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,450
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him.

1028
01:01:52,930 --> 01:01:53,630
Shia Laboff.

1029
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:56,170
Alan is a good rider.

1030
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,710
You'll see Mint, the best at riding.

1031
01:01:58,090 --> 01:01:58,930
I believe you?

1032
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:01,470
Tentative.

1033
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,610
Wait, climb in the tree, baby.

1034
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:09,110
Nice.

1035
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:16,980
Anybody there?

1036
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:19,360
Please, I've been in an accident.

1037
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:21,960
My name is Alan Wake.

1038
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,140
I am a writer.

1039
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,900
I am seeking assistance.

1040
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,420
I have been in an accident.

1041
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:31,040
Oh.

1042
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:32,580
You got this?

1043
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,660
I can't tell what the yellow dot is though still.

1044
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,180
Is that like where I'm supposed to...

1045
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:38,960
It's not where I'm supposed to be.

1046
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:39,840
Is this where I'm supposed?

1047
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,340
Oh, it's just, like, it's the marker that says find help,
but...

1048
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:43,420
Hey!

1049
01:02:44,780 --> 01:02:45,320
Hey, you!

1050
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:45,800
Okay.

1051
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,440
There's been an accident.

1052
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:49,020
I need help.

1053
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:49,960
This is it.

1054
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,100
I need to...

1055
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,100
It's got the spooky...

1056
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,380
Cabins for rent in...

1057
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:54,620
Lightfall!

1058
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:55,540
Oh, hell.

1059
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,220
Carl Stucky.

1060
01:02:58,580 --> 01:02:59,020
Oh, no!

1061
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,460
To beat you.

1062
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,080
No, Carl!

1063
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:05,660
Non-refundable reservation deposit required.

1064
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:08,020
Fair and square.

1065
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:08,700
Oh!

1066
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:11,640
Uh-oh.

1067
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:16,140
Where is he?

1068
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:17,660
Oh, gosh.

1069
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,220
This is like a maze in here.

1070
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:19,980
Where did I go?

1071
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,220
Oh, that's a flashlight right there.

1072
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:22,820
Ah!

1073
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,500
Where did he come from?

1074
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,540
Oh, he's scaring me.

1075
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,520
This is so scary.

1076
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,140
Oh, my gosh.

1077
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:34,100
Oh, thermos.

1078
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,680
Can I get a gun?

1079
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:39,740
Or a flashlight or anything?

1080
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:41,660
Non!

1081
01:03:42,920 --> 01:04:10,000

1082
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,300

door with his axe like Nicholson in the Shining.

1083
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,300
Oh my gosh, yeah, revolver.

1084
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,160
Flashlight!

1085
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,980
We're back in business, baby.

1086
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:29,740
Batteries.

1087
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:30,500

1088
01:04:30,980 --> 01:04:31,740
Give me more batteries.

1089
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:33,260
Very nice.

1090
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,420
Carl Stucky.

1091
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,140
During your pastoral hackling.

1092
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:42,340
Trying not walking.

1093
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,580
It's a background audio cutting off repeat for anyone else.

1094
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:47,980
In It's not for me.

1095
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,660
Testably.

1096
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:51,360
Proven.

1097
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:52,740
Health benefits.

1098
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,620
Like you.

1099
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:54,520
You.

1100
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:56,640
Yes.

1101
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,700
Right fall sheriff station.

1102
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:01,460
Oh, may I...

1103
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:02,620
And keep those...

1104
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:02,880
No!

1105
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,000
Oh, my God.

1106
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,040
Oh, no.

1107
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:08,820
Oh, my God.

1108
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,120
Holy cow.

1109
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,000
Oh, shoot.

1110
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:19,140
It's...

1111
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:19,640
Ah!

1112
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,700
Oh my god.

1113
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:23,280
Uh, I can't move.

1114
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:24,080
There we go.

1115
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:25,060
Get out of there!

1116
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:26,340
Okay.

1117
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:28,920
Um, where do I go?

1118
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:32,420
Not over here, I guess.

1119
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,220
Where did the tractor go?

1120
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:38,520
Okay.

1121
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:41,360
Very cool.

1122
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:45,240
Where do I go?

1123
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:46,860
Oh, thank you.

1124
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,740
There were more of them.

1125
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:51,760
More of who?

1126
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:07,960
Ouch, ouch.

1127
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:08,720
Oh,

1128
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:21,450
my God.

1129
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:22,290
It's tricky.

1130
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:24,250
I'm trying to learn the combat a little bit.

1131
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:28,930
Because my hand keeps slipping between L1 and, like,
trigger.

1132
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:30,190
You know?

1133
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:32,950
The bulldozer had gone over the cliff with the office.

1134
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:35,330
I hope Stucky had suffered the same fate.

1135
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:37,650
But I wasn't planning on staying to find out.

1136
01:06:37,710 --> 01:06:38,010
Damn.

1137
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,990
I'm guessing I have to fight them, though, because...

1138
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:41,410
Well, I...

1139
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,630
I guess I just need to turn off the power to...

1140
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:50,950
And then it's XXXXX reload, right?

1141
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:51,590
Okay, yeah.

1142
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:54,830
But, okay.

1143
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:59,130
Shield first, then shoot.

1144
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,490
Yeah, like, okay, so it's...

1145
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:01,650
No.

1146
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:05,350
Shoot, okay, yeah, okay.

1147
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:10,110
Lensflare is their shield HP.

1148
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:10,950
What's that mean?

1149
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:12,590
I didn't see a lens flare.

1150
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:14,390
Okay.

1151
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,600
Oh, okay, I think I...

1152
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:27,170
You.

1153
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:35,450
Woo!

1154
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:41,660
Nice!

1155
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:46,880
Nice you?

1156
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,600
Oh, can I...

1157
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:49,200
Oh, shoot.

1158
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:51,940
Ouch, ouch!

1159
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,360
I got too far and...

1160
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:10,000
I'd never fired a gun outside of getting used to it getting
used to it I just killed someone or something there were no

1161
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:21,100
bodies they just disappeared okay if I was dreaming it felt
real enough to make me sick all right getting used to it I

1162
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:33,740
love the yellow paint let's go I love how he narrates
everything it's so good kick it don't shoot until they flash

1163
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:41,580
the darkness makes the immune to bullets oh okay the dark
forest was the last place I wanted to go but I had no choice

1164
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:50,120
I had to get to the gas station what's the yellow paint for
though it only shows up when I wait what's the yellow paint

1165
01:08:50,120 --> 01:09:01,160
for this way Erie hand-painted graffiti was revealed by my
flashlight someone had hidden a chest of supplies near it oh

1166
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,520
neat oh

1167
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:09,840
Anything else?

1168
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,820
That's it?

1169
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,660
Alright, let's go.

1170
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:16,460
The breathing is creepy.

1171
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,820
Is this the kind of game where I can, like...

1172
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,160
I mean, obviously in this one, I...

1173
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:27,520
I guess I could have avoided the combat if I just ran past
them and kicked the thing, but...

1174
01:09:29,880 --> 01:09:31,820
Halo, when the flashlight is on them, is the shield.

1175
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:36,100
Maybe I'm just not seeing it.

1176
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:39,920
Sorry, I'll stop breathing.

1177
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:40,240
Woo!

1178
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:43,100
Combat is mostly unavoidable.

1179
01:09:43,360 --> 01:09:43,900
Okay, okay.

1180
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,540
Good to know.

1181
01:09:47,260 --> 01:09:47,880
Yay, checkpoint!

1182
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,340
Rabbit season.

1183
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:53,920
Rabbit season.

1184
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,680
So like...

1185
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,220
Oh!

1186
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
Like that.

1187
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,480
But then how do I...

1188
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,740
No, he's...

1189
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:05,640
Oh!

1190
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:06,900
Like that!

1191
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:09,960
Wabbit season.

1192
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:25,690
Understood.

1193
01:10:26,930 --> 01:10:27,590
What's up here?

1194
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:28,230
More people?

1195
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:30,510
It's like a little light.

1196
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:32,390
What's a little light for?

1197
01:10:33,790 --> 01:10:35,210
Oh, magic script.

1198
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,470
Not survival horror nerd here.

1199
01:10:39,790 --> 01:10:41,470
No, Alan Wake is not survival horror.

1200
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:43,550
It's way easier to take the enemies out than to run away.

1201
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:44,270
Okay, good.

1202
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:45,410
Hi, hi, Minto.

1203
01:10:45,870 --> 01:10:46,490
Hi, hi, Brendan.

1204
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,470
Hope you're feeling good today.

1205
01:10:52,290 --> 01:10:53,150
Oh, read the pages.

1206
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:53,710
So true.

1207
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:57,210
Rose daydreams about Wake.

1208
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:00,090
Wait, Wake fights a Taken with life.

1209
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:01,450
The Taken stood before me.

1210
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:07,410
It was impossible to focus on it as if it stood in a blind
spot caused by a brain tumor and eye disease.

1211
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:12,550
It was bleeding shadows like ink underwater, like a cloud of
blood from a shark bite.

1212
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:20,430
i was terrified i squeezed the flashlight like my life
depended on it willing it to stop coming any closer suddenly

1213
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:33,230
something gave and the light seemed to shine brighter magic
and then rose rose knew she had been gushing but right now

1214
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:38,890
she didn't care gushing as far as she was concerned her
brief meeting with alan wake was literally the high point of

1215
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:49,350
her life she watched as he got pretty confident at ease with
wake not like rose they were perfect for each other she'd

1216
01:11:49,350 --> 01:12:00,070
have given anything to be called their friend oh my god you
just met him at the at the cafe for two seconds ma'am watch

1217
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:02,490
your head

1218
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:10,870
checkpoint oh my god

1219
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:26,960
what the hell was that your guess is as good as mine Spooky
happenings are happening ahead.

1220
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:31,720
When I saw the river below, something uncoiled itself inside
my head.

1221
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,740
I realized that I'd have to find a way across.

1222
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:36,740
I didn't even want to look at the water.

1223
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:40,440
Yes?

1224
01:12:41,420 --> 01:12:41,980
Yes.

1225
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,840
I'm looking around for any secrets.

1226
01:12:52,060 --> 01:12:53,420
It's so jungly.

1227
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,380
Things really boring in town for Rose, okay?

1228
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,100
It's probably true, right?

1229
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:01,440
Alright.

1230
01:13:03,020 --> 01:13:06,580
This is like really something, huh?

1231
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,760
Is that a box there?

1232
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,340
Like, that I couldn't?

1233
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,140
Oh, come on, jump.

1234
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:13,940
There we go.

1235
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:15,440
Alan jump.

1236
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:16,880
Alan run.

1237
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:18,080
Alan explore.

1238
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,040
Like, what the heck are these trees?

1239
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:21,640
Well, it is a box.

1240
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,940
Just a box.

1241
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:36,300
Oh, it's a manuscript we're getting like the whole what's it
called like the whole story so far but in these pages barry

1242
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:42,060
wheeler was bouncing off the walls he jumped on a plane
after his calls were ignored by both al and alice for

1243
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:48,540
several days oh it could mean that they were both on a
second honeymoon but barry didn't buy it al had been way too

1244
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:55,420
unstable for that not sleeping messed up oh no barry had
years of experience dealing with alan wake and he couldn't

1249
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:37,620
No!

1250
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:41,080
Forgot how Max Pain, like Alan Wake, moved.

1251
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:43,500
Same team?

1252
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:45,900
We could play as Rose in expansion.

1253
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:46,540
It's silly.

1254
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,840
Wait, that sounds so fun.

1255
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,640
That sounds pretty silly.

1256
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:50,600
Stucky!

1257
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:54,280
Oh, batteries.

1258
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:56,740
And ammo.

1259
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:02,480
Okay.

1260
01:15:06,340 --> 01:15:06,620
Oh.

1261
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:08,620
The game?

1262
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,160
Wow!

1263
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:09,660
Oh!

1264
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:25,520
What happened?

1265
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:28,240
Wait.

1266
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:28,940
Ah!

1267
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,150
Okay.

1268
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,580
The game suddenly turned into eternal darkness.

1269
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,040
Oh my gosh.

1270
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,140
That scared me.

1271
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,180
I thought I was gonna have to restart or something.

1272
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:19,670
Our sanity is too low, Hey, buddy.

1273
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:22,230
Paragon, paragon.

1274
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,950
Let's see.

1275
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,230
Going around.

1276
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:28,170
There's a big old light up there.

1277
01:16:29,750 --> 01:16:31,830
I guess it wants me to go over there.

1278
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:33,330
I'm assuming.

1279
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,350
The staircase was broken.

1280
01:16:40,610 --> 01:16:40,930
No!

1281
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,970
I had to make my way up some other way.

1282
01:16:43,170 --> 01:16:44,710
Who turned out the light?

1283
01:16:48,910 --> 01:16:50,470
Okay, open that up.

1284
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:53,610
Grab everything.

1285
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,150
Hell you.

1286
01:16:55,970 --> 01:16:57,850
I like that it does kind of guide you, though.

1287
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:00,890
I see where the, like, what the yellow dot means now.

1288
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:01,550
Wait, what was that?

1289
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,250
Oh, there was something else I missed.

1290
01:17:05,430 --> 01:17:06,190
Oh, I can't.

1291
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,590
This isn't really happening!

1292
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:13,570
Urm.

1293
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:15,450
Urm.

1294
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:17,370
There was no power.

1295
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:20,870
There was bound to be a generator somewhere at the logging
site.

1296
01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:24,790
You mean that green light that's flashing over there?

1297
01:17:25,890 --> 01:17:27,590
Psycho Mantis using blackout.

1298
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:33,260
Oh, whoops.

1299
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:34,900
Jump to climb.

1300
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:40,090
Hmm.

1301
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:44,110
I think...

1302
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:45,830
What's climb?

1303
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:46,430
What am I climb?

1304
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:48,010
Oh, probably the staircase, yeah.

1305
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,950
I think I gotta go over there.

1306
01:17:54,130 --> 01:17:54,750
Me thinks.

1307
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:59,550
With all this forestry equipment around, there had to be
something I could use to reach the top.

1308
01:17:59,570 --> 01:18:00,870
Am I going to parkour?

1309
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:02,170
What's going on here?

1310
01:18:04,210 --> 01:18:04,710
Okay.

1311
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:08,070
There's a thermos.

1312
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:09,050
I see it.

1313
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:10,750
You guys see it right there.

1314
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:12,410
It's right there.

1315
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:16,170
Oh my gosh.

1316
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:17,730
Okay, there's fall damage.

1317
01:18:18,190 --> 01:18:18,810
Today I learned.

1318
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,430
Alan jump.

1319
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,130
Alan, don't jump too far.

1320
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:32,520
I'm not going to be such a stickler for the thermoses
because I don't want to that to be like the main focus but

1321
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:42,960
if i see one i'll try and get it i might i've already missed
one so you know no biggie allen fall

1322
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:21,600

that i can like reload really quickly and a script page and

1323
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,940

1324
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:25,300
Let's go!

1325
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:30,830
What do we got here?

1326
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,670
Wake attacked by birds!

1327
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:37,720
Cut down entirely!

1328
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:39,800
I gotta get better at dodging, but...

1329
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,300
I heard them before I saw them.

1330
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,220
Swooping down from the sky and screeching as they came.

1331
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,860
I spun around just as the cloud was upon me.

1332
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:49,860
For an instant, I stared into a hundred dead eyes.

1333
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,120
Black pearls glittering in the darkness.

1334
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:55,520
I raised the flashlight and the swarm exploded like
fireworks.

1335
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:55,960
Oh, they did?

1336
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:56,660
They were supposed to do that?

1337
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:57,240
That is burned.

1338
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,180
Turned into ash.

1339
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,000
I couldn't hear my scream above theirs.

1340
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:01,820
Ha!

1341
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:02,820
What?

1342
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:04,300
What?

1343
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:06,260
Okay.

1344
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:07,940
It's kind of funny.

1345
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,500
Crayon made!

1346
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:10,000
Woohoo!

1347
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:13,360

1348

Thank you.

1349
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,340
Crayon.

1350
01:20:17,660 --> 01:20:19,400
You guys say crayon or crayon?

1351
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:23,160
I've been trying the more to say crayon instead of crayon.

1352
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,160
But it feels more natural to say crayon.

1353
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:42,240
Crayon I like saying crayon There's light They

1354
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:48,020

1355

01:21:51,560 --> 01:21:52,100
Yeah.

1362
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:55,140
Lots of light now.

1363
01:21:55,740 --> 01:21:57,040
It shouldn't be around here.

1364
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,060
Wee.

1365
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:01,740
Wee.

1366
01:22:03,240 --> 01:22:03,820
Wee.

1367
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:05,320
Wee.

1368
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:06,100
Alan, jump!

1369
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:07,960
Oh my god.

1370
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:08,880
Alan, don't fall!

1371
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:11,260
Alan, what's that?

1372
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,280
Alan, gas, gas, gas.

1373
01:22:13,660 --> 01:22:14,420
Alan, jump!

1374
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,180
Hell yeah.

1375
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:17,800
Alan, make it.

1376
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:24,060
What's over here?

1377
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:24,920
Gotta be something.

1378
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:28,180
Besides target practice.

1379
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:31,760
Alan Verb.

1380
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,920
Might be my favorite joke ever.

1381
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:38,660
Oh!

1382
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,680
Um, what?

1383
01:22:45,430 --> 01:22:46,960
What was that?

1384
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:50,800
Alan glitch!

1385
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:55,040
Is there supposed to be something here?

1386
01:22:58,580 --> 01:22:59,180
Checkpoint!

1387
01:23:02,460 --> 01:23:07,440
I swear this game is more eternal darkness than we realize,
baby.

1388
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:10,120
My sanity is crazy low.

1389
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:11,900
What do we have?

1390
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:13,540
Oh, that looks like shotgun shells, yeah.

1391
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:21,250
Well, I was just outside for a breath of fresh air.

1392
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:28,790
air and what a night i i know most of you are probably in
your beds by now but if you're still up and around take a

1393
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:38,190
moment step outside for a spell and breathe in the weather
is absolutely still the sky is crystal clear it's like

1394
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:48,770
before alan finish it off with gunderbolt epic version of
this game is riddled by these glitches well isn't epic the

1395
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:54,150
only way you can play it technically or That's what I
thought I heard someone say before.

1396
01:23:54,290 --> 01:23:55,010
Right, here I am.

1397
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:57,830
And we'll keep you company all night long if I weren't.

1398
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:58,570
So bright.

1399
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:01,190
It looks like I'm not the only one staying up late.

1400
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,450
Caller, you're on the air.

1401
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:05,230
Maurice Horton.

1402
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,410
What are you up to?

1403
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,630
Well, I was just taking Toby on his walkies.

1404
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:09,170
Walkies.

1405
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:10,670
Oh, isn't it beautiful out there?

1406
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:16,330
Sure, but Pat, the reason I called is that Toby heard
something rustling in the undergrowth and took off after it,

1407
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:17,370
and I couldn't find it.

1408
01:24:17,630 --> 01:24:18,430
Probably a rabbit.

1409
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:19,130
I have it on Steam.

1410
01:24:19,310 --> 01:24:19,970
Oh, really?

1411
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:21,190
Well, heck, I got it for free.

1412
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:22,970
on this one so it's fine.

1413
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:28,930
And Toby's a friendly dog.

1414
01:24:30,770 --> 01:24:31,110
Uh oh.

1415
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:33,210
We're not gonna have to shoot Toby, are we?

1416
01:24:33,210 --> 01:24:34,390
We were pretty far

1417
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,520
put.

1418
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:44,000
Well, Maurice, it's out there now.

1419
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:45,440
Hope Toby comes home soon.

1420
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,360
Yeah, thanks, Pat.

1421
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,380
You have a good night.

1422
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,880
There's no urgency for this dog at all.

1423
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:52,760
Not even like a...

1424
01:24:52,760 --> 01:24:55,200
This is what my dog looks like.

1425
01:24:57,660 --> 01:24:58,140
Yellow.

1426
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:00,120
Yellow.

1427
01:25:05,490 --> 01:25:06,730
Are these ever a trap?

1428
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:07,690
Oh,

1429
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,000
I don't like the breathing at all.

1430
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:15,020
It's so scary.

1431
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:22,280
Breathing equals secrets nearby.

1432
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,620
Oh, that's what it is.

1433
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:25,900
It just sounds scary.

1434
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:28,360
Oh my god, the music.

1435
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:30,660
This game's out to get me.

1436
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:31,800
Out to DMCA me.

1437
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:34,800
What do we got?

1438
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:37,560
What?

1439
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,220
That's what I'm doing right now.

1440
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:41,560
At first I kept finding the pages as if by accident.

1441
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:48,400
The book I couldn't remember was either a terrible and true
prophecy or an act of creation that had rewritten the world.

1442
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:53,140
I began to hunt the pages feverishly, for they held the
answer to the mystery.

1443
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,020
With it, I could save myself.

1444
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:55,700
Yes, it did.

1445
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,220
I could save Alice.

1446
01:25:58,300 --> 01:25:58,740
We could?

1447
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,080
Is that what we are thinking?

1448
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:04,840
All right.

1449
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:05,580
What's this?

1450
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:07,900
Just some sticks.

1451
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:08,540
Whoa.

1452

Don't scare me out here, okay?

1457
01:26:47,620 --> 01:26:48,060
Please.

1458
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:50,240
I'm just a...

1459
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:53,680
What's that sound?

1460
01:26:56,940 --> 01:26:58,080
Don't sound so good.

1461
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:01,220
We... Safe haven.

1462
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:01,600
Wait.

1463
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:02,800
What do you mean, safe haven?

1464
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,400
Wow!

1465
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,000
Child, child.

1466
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:06,840
If I turn this on?

1467
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:08,320
Wait, don't pick up the revolver.

1468
01:27:08,580 --> 01:27:08,740
Ah!

1469
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:09,640
Oh my god.

1470
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:11,500
Ouch.

1471
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:13,000
They're gonna get me good.

1472
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,460
I didn't realize I had my flare equipped, but good thing I
did, I suppose.

1473
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:21,500
Please start.

1474
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:33,250
Oh my gosh.

1475
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:35,930
Cute!

1476
01:27:37,290 --> 01:27:38,790
Oh my gosh.

1477
01:27:39,210 --> 01:27:40,530
Thank you for the redirect.

1478
01:27:42,970 --> 01:27:44,770
Oh my gosh.

1479
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:46,610
Now, yeah, now it's safe.

1480
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:59,330
I'm starting Alan Wake for the first time we just started
not too long ago but things are already kind of corrosive

1481
01:28:00,210 --> 01:28:07,650

1484
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:22,350
started stream.

1485
01:28:25,590 --> 01:28:26,440
Pokemon Z-A.

1486
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,930
Boy, are you kidding?

1487
01:28:27,930 --> 01:28:28,670

I'm just like, yo, yo, thank you for the podcast.

1489
01:28:31,470 --> 01:28:32,750
Simply thinking for the twine.

1490
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:35,430
Wow, I'm playing Pokemon.

1491
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:37,690
Back up to that Pokemon grind.

1492
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:39,390
It looks really fun.

1493
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:42,170
I thought about it.

1494
01:28:43,450 --> 01:28:44,070
Z-A.

1495
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:45,510
Pokemon Z-A.

1496
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:45,970
Z-A.

1497
01:28:46,010 --> 01:28:47,310
Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-ZZZZZZ.

1498
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:52,340
Play it!

1499
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,200
Should I?

1500
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:57,960
Oh, my PC just crashed as I was typing a comment.

1501
01:28:58,420 --> 01:28:59,180
I was saying.

1502
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:01,940
Bill, thank you for the tech gifted.

1503
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,980
Bill, thank you for the tech gifted.

1504
01:29:08,660 --> 01:29:09,620
Do it.

1505
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:10,460
Pizza.

1506
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:12,240
Why are we saying pizza?

1507
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:17,460
Congratulations on your spicy adult only concert happening.

1508
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:18,780
Why do you have to say that?

1509
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,640
Why do you like that?

1510
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,660
Why do you...

1511
01:29:22,660 --> 01:29:24,180
Why is a phrase like that?

1512
01:29:24,780 --> 01:29:25,280
Speedifier?

1513
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:25,900
Thank you!

1514
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:26,340
It trickles!

1515
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:27,180
Thank you!

1516
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:30,800
They did...

1517
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:31,780
That was pretty funny, though.

1518
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:33,780
They did have to change it at, like, the last second.

1519
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:36,740
There's been so many...

1520
01:29:36,740 --> 01:29:37,400
Oh, man.

1521
01:29:38,300 --> 01:29:39,720
Can I rant a little bit?

1522
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,280
Not about Oshi Spark, but, like...

1523
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:43,740
Because they've been great.

1524
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,120
Everything that has happened has been out of their hands,
unfortunately.

1525
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:58,840
Basically, basically, last second, they were like, they
heard, so, they had the contract, and they made the contract

1526
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:07,160
that said that the concert would be for all ages, but then
the people that went through the contract, they didn't

1527
01:30:07,160 --> 01:30:21,500
specify that the location was 21 plus only, so, so, um, what
the heck then they had to change at the very last minute to

1528
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:30,540
be like sorry if you pre sailed for a ticket but if you're
under 21 you have to you can't you can't you should don't

1529
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:40,160
get a ticket because you won't be allowed in so first there
was that and then unfortunately with the venue that we chose

1530
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:51,980
we had to sell the tickets through Ticketmaster and luckily
I believe all the pre-sale tickets were bought by real

1531
01:30:51,980 --> 01:31:01,680
people because they were for everybody who registered you
know only yeah ticket master hey there Oshi Spark said

1532
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:11,760
they're currently looking into if the because the general
sales opened up today and they're it's hard to say if they

1533
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:22,800
were completely scalped or if um So if you see someone on
like, what's it called, Twitter being like, I have tickets

1534
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:29,300
for Minto's jazz show, don't trust it because it could be a
scam, you know, something like that.

1535
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:33,800
But Oshi Spark is looking into it.

1536
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,080
So I apologize.

1537
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:44,360
I know it's out of my hands, but I never thought that that
would happen to an event like mine.

1538
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:45,840
So I'm really, really sorry.

1539
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,280
into like Taylor Swift.

1540
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:57,960
I guess there's probably people out there that are just
waiting to scalp any event on Ticketmaster, but yeah.

1541
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,300
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1542
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,880
Sadly, it is all concerts.

1543
01:32:07,240 --> 01:32:15,460
But, you know, there will be events in the future and they
will not use Ticketmaster.

1544
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:28,260
that I can guarantee so yes yes yes that I can tell you

1545
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:38,960
definitely a learning experience yeah well I was like
stressing about it before stream too I was just like I don't

1546
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:46,260
want you know people to be upset it's not Oshi Spark's fault
mint as powerful as Taylor's Swift confirmed.

1547
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:46,880
Oh, yeah.

1548
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,160
Oh, yeah.

1549
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,100
Call me.

1550
01:32:49,180 --> 01:32:50,220
You're not a Swiftie.

1551
01:32:50,360 --> 01:32:51,480
You're a Minty.

1552
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,740
But, oh.

1553
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:01,240
It's not your fault, Min.

1554
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,580
We understand the situation.

1555
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:04,620
No.

1556
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,640
Even scalpers.

1557
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:06,120
No.

1558
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:06,640
No.

1559
01:33:06,940 --> 01:33:07,320
They don't.

1560
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:07,520
No.

1561
01:33:07,620 --> 01:33:08,340
They don't know.

1562
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,560
They just buy up any tickets that's on there.

1563
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:17,280
You'd think that we would have, like, things to help prevent
this by now.

1564
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:20,200
But clearly, it's an issue.

1565
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:24,900
Clearly, it's too difficult to figure out, I suppose.

1566
01:33:25,780 --> 01:33:29,020
But, yeah, sorry, I just wanted to rant a little bit about
it.

1567
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:30,460
Oshi Spark has been great.

1568
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:31,260
They have not.

1569
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,880
They have been very communicative.

1570
01:33:33,120 --> 01:33:39,560
And anytime I have a question or anything or an issue, they
have been good about helping me out.

1571
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,860
So, I just signed an NFL contract if you want to go on a
date sometime.

1572
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:47,760
Wait, what's this?

1573
01:33:47,780 --> 01:34:02,320

1576
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,960
Is there an evil guy out there?

1577
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:22,600
Another one?

1578
01:34:27,090 --> 01:34:30,210
I can't tell if it's evil guy or ambiance.

1579
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:32,270
Evil guys!

1580
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:40,900

1581
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:57,720

1582
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,740
Good luck with work, Phil!

1583
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,480

Oh

1589
01:35:34,990 --> 01:35:37,210
Oh, scared me, man.

1590
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,060
Holy cow!

1591
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,280
I tried to switch to my flare.

1592
01:35:46,620 --> 01:35:48,140
Okay, it's the left, lefty pod.

1593
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,220
Manuscript.

1594
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:55,380
TV in the gas station.

1595
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,380
I stepped into the gas station's garage.

1596
01:35:57,780 --> 01:35:58,820
It was dark and quiet.

1597
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,320
The place was a mess.

1598
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:00,540
Oh.

1599
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:06,080
It looked like someone trashed the place or that there'd
been some kind of fight Light spilled into the room through

1600
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:10,800
an open door at the back and I made my way toward it
Spoilers nice shooting text.

1601
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:18,320
I was blinded by a bright light An old portable TV on the
shelf had come alive by itself Impossibly I could see myself

1602
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:23,900
on the screen talking like a madman The game is spoiling me.

1603
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:31,520
Maybe I should have Ready So we're going around up and
around around, it seems.

1604
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:35,860
Oh, thank goodness light.

1605
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,660
It gets so bright.

1606
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:43,260
It gets so bright.

1607
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,620
Can I pick up that?

1608
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:46,740
Pick up that.

1609
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,640
Is there anything over there?

1610
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:52,580
Oh, this is where I'm supposed to go.

1611
01:36:53,740 --> 01:36:54,820
Wait, can I not go this way?

1612
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:57,220
Oh, it's a cliff.

1613
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:00,360
For some reason, I thought it was a bridge.

1614
01:37:01,860 --> 01:37:03,560
Oh, okay, I see it.

1615
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:04,560
It's right over there.

1616
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:07,280
This is, like, the largest lumberyard ever.

1617
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:09,300
Why is that swinging down there?

1618
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,340
Am I about to play American Warrior?

1619
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:13,400
American Ninja Warrior?

1620
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,440
What's going on?

1621
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:16,380
Alan flip.

1622
01:37:16,820 --> 01:37:17,680
Alan, do a flip.

1623
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:21,300
I hear.

1624
01:37:22,440 --> 01:37:22,760
Breath.

1625
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:24,260
Breathe.

1626
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,700
Spooky breath.

1627
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:27,860
Spooky breathe.

1628
01:37:31,460 --> 01:37:32,540
Oh my god!

1629
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:34,540
The quietest boulders ever.

1630
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:45,140
Alan breathe, Alan breathe.

1631
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:46,520
Yeah.

1632
01:37:47,260 --> 01:37:48,860
I'll take another flare gun, yeah.

1633
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:51,640
Just pick them up, pick all of them up.

1634
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:55,540
Very nice!

1635
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:56,780
Alan parkour.

1636
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:08,060
So, I have to ask though, how many episodes are in this
game?

1637
01:38:08,220 --> 01:38:12,400
I wonder if we should do it kind of similarly to where I've
done in the past where I do one episode.

1638
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:13,420
episode per stream?

1639
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:21,600
John Allen Wake!

1640
01:38:24,980 --> 01:38:26,360
Six episodes, five episodes?

1641
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:29,580
They aren't all the same length.

1642
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:30,580
Ah, okay, okay.

1643
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:32,980
I guess we'll have to see.

1644
01:38:33,860 --> 01:38:34,540
Six plus DLCs.

1645
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:36,620
Oh, I see, I see.

1646
01:38:48,630 --> 01:38:50,130
Salads aren't bad for you though.

1647
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:50,570
It's okay.

1648
01:38:50,750 --> 01:38:51,750
You can touch a salad.

1649
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,150
It's just lettuce.

1650
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:54,730
Logging area.

1651
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:55,310
Okay.

1652
01:38:56,730 --> 01:38:59,670
We back in the lumber mines.

1653
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:01,230
It doesn't work.

1654
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:01,970
I give up.

1655
01:39:06,110 --> 01:39:07,150
Is that a page down there?

1656
01:39:08,950 --> 01:39:09,550
Ambush!

1657
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:10,510
Holy moly.

1658
01:39:10,970 --> 01:39:11,690
That's a lot of guys.

1659
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,680
Yeah, you saw it.

1660
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:30,760
You really thought, huh?

1661
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,680
Alan cracked?

1662
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:42,500
That was pretty good, wasn't it?

1663
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,360
That was pretty clean.

1664
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:45,300
If I'd just say so myself?

1665
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:50,780
Should probably use my shotgun more often, huh?

1666
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,590
Yeah, science!

1667
01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:04,810
Oh my god, it really is the Twilight Zone.

1668
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,050
Hustleop would be proud.

1669
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:08,130
Don't say that!

1670
01:40:08,430 --> 01:40:09,670
Don't say that!

1671
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:13,090
Night Springs.

1672
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:15,290
Night Springs.

1673
01:40:15,310 --> 01:40:16,170
Tonight's episode.

1674
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:18,150
A quantum suicide.

1675
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:19,450
Wait, can we watch the whole thing?

1676
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:26,650
If our lives are already written, it would take a courageous
man to change the script.

1677
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:32,870
Having called a press conference, Barclay Colvin is about to
demonstrate that very courage.

1678
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:34,720
How long is it?

1679
01:40:35,390 --> 01:40:35,850
Let's hurry up.

1680
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:40,750
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, I am Dr. Barclay Colvin.

1681
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:46,590
And I'm glad so many of you could join me here at the
Moorcock Institute.

1682
01:40:47,690 --> 01:40:53,330
Tonight, I'm going to give a practical demonstration of the
many worlds interpretation.

1683
01:40:53,930 --> 01:40:53,950
Whoa.

1684
01:40:54,650 --> 01:40:59,150
As you can see, this is a loaded 9mm pistol.

1685
01:40:59,670 --> 01:41:08,750
it shall be part of a thought experiment and now oh a real
experiment i didn't even know as a quantum suicide did he

1686
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:17,090
say suicide is that a real gun he's kidding right please
please stay welcome to membership thank you there is no risk

1687
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:25,650
observe what occurs when i place the weapon against my own
the more what institute now you might think this round is

1688
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:39,130
merely a dud the dud not so flower pot and yet I myself
cannot be harmed with this gun with each pull of the trigger

1689
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:48,070
two new realities branch off one in which the weapon didn't
fire and one where it did with my machine here I have

1690
01:41:48,070 --> 01:42:02,130
ensured that this reality that's crazy I have bestowed upon
myself quantum immortality this gun kill me uh-oh so wait

1691
01:42:02,130 --> 01:42:09,990
wait wait what you're saying is foreshadowing trigger in
another reality you die yes yes of course but that's

1692
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:17,650
completely trivial there's an infinite number of things that
could happen at any moment they always do happen somewhere

1693
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:33,830
the point is this one thing oh my god not happen here insane
insane insane hey was this thing supposed to be plugged in i

1694
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:50,090
stumbled on it you fools gaze upon quantum immortality oh my
god the reactions are crazy poor dr colvin filled by his own

1695
01:42:50,090 --> 01:43:00,490
hubris or the ignorance of the masses oh my god the the
narrator voice is so perfect Adam unobserved curiosity often

1696
01:43:00,490 --> 01:43:12,890
kills the cat the camera was set up by a spring ah it sounds
just like the Twilight Zone narrator it's so good it's so

1697
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:25,550
good just a box just a box just about I like how everything
has like slight ragdoll physics it's really funny okay i

1698
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:32,750
feel like i'm about to face off against a boss potentially
so let's get our maybe our shoddy wait before we do that

1699
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:34,090
before we open this gate though

1700
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:41,530
we shall get this page

1701
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:53,530
wait lies to the sheriff wait a second wait a second you're
You're already making me as a criminal!

1702
01:43:56,230 --> 01:43:57,510
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1703
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:59,070
Wait, wait, wait!

1704
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:00,690
Wait, wait, wait!

1705
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:05,890
Remedy loves doing these show things.

1706
01:44:06,030 --> 01:44:06,770
That's so fun!

1707
01:44:06,930 --> 01:44:07,630
I love that.

1708
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:09,110
Alright, let's press the button.

1709
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:16,030
Why am I- what am I lying for?

1710
01:44:18,810 --> 01:44:20,610
What do I need to lie about?

1711
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:22,690
Am I breaking and entering?

1712
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:23,870
Is that what I'm lying about?

1713
01:44:27,230 --> 01:44:28,110
Turn off.

1714
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:35,370
It's quite loud in here.

1715
01:44:35,630 --> 01:44:36,650
I mean to have a great day!

1716
01:44:36,930 --> 01:44:37,690
Wait, great day!

1717
01:44:41,070 --> 01:44:42,770
Sorry, I was saying...

1718
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:44,250
In my brain, I was saying Quinn!

1719
01:44:55,110 --> 01:44:56,390
Have a great day!

1720
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:57,210
Oh, good checkpoint.

1721
01:44:57,450 --> 01:44:57,570
Okay.

1722
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:00,070
Oh, that's a lot.

1723
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:00,790
Oh, no.

1724
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:02,210
Oh, no.

1725
01:45:03,570 --> 01:45:04,150
Oh, no.

1726
01:45:21,340 --> 01:45:21,860
Okay.

1727
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:23,880
Spooky.

1728
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,180
All right.

1729
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:30,520
I guess we're going up against him now.

1730
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,060
Hi, Shuts!

1731
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:35,500
I'm scared!

1732
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:44,630
It came from, like, my left ear.

1733
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:47,270
But I guess it doesn't matter.

1734
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:50,350
It's probably play, like, some sort of cinematic, I imagine.

1735
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:50,850
Oh!

1736
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:52,410
Yep.

1737
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:54,090
Ha!

1738
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:57,820
Oh, shoot!

1739
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:58,900
There's a bunch of them.

1740
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:00,220
Oh shoot, there's a bunch of them.

1741
01:46:06,210 --> 01:46:08,030
Oh shoot, wow, that was so close.

1742
01:46:20,900 --> 01:46:21,220
Nice.

1743
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,900
Oh god, there was so many.

1744
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,460
Whoa, what the heck was that?

1745
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,240
Oh, oh.

1746
01:46:34,900 --> 01:46:35,220
Oh.

1747
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:40,460
Is he...

1748
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,320
Did he...

1749
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:43,400
Okay, nice.

1750
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:46,640
Oh, oh.

1751
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:47,660
Oh.

1752
01:46:51,200 --> 01:46:51,720
Oh.

1753
01:46:51,720 --> 01:46:51,820
Oh.

1754
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:53,000
He's kind of freaky.

1755
01:46:58,820 --> 01:46:59,080
Woo!

1756
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:01,020
Ah!

1757
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:03,480
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1758
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:05,260
I tried to...

1759
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:08,080
Oh.

1760
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:08,300
I tried to...

1761
01:47:08,300 --> 01:47:08,400
Oh.

1762
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:08,620
Oh.

1763
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:10,760
Is it just him left?

1764
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:11,860
I guess so.

1765
01:47:12,380 --> 01:47:13,100
I don't know where he went.

1766
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:13,660
Oh, there he is.

1767
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:14,880
Oh, my God.

1768
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:30,760
Nice!

1769
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,060
Okay.

1770
01:47:34,220 --> 01:47:35,560
Stucky's body vanished.

1771
01:47:35,780 --> 01:47:38,680
Leaving behind only a lifetime of nightmares to come.

1772
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:41,940
Assuming I'd reach the lights of the gas station alive.

1773
01:47:44,380 --> 01:47:45,620
Um, I'm gonna go back to this.

1774
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,580
I don't want to waste all my shotgun ammo.

1775
01:47:47,700 --> 01:47:48,400
I feel like I did.

1776
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:49,300
But whatever.

1777
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:51,320
Uh, where am I going?

1778
01:47:53,080 --> 01:47:53,520
This...

1779
01:47:54,220 --> 01:47:56,380
This... There's a green light here, though.

1780
01:47:57,500 --> 01:47:58,800
Do I not need to... Oh, Tharbois.

1781
01:48:01,200 --> 01:48:02,600
Oh, I do need to go this way.

1782
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:03,040
Just kidding.

1783
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:05,860
Anything else around here, though?

1784
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:08,560
Just doing a little bit of exploration.

1785
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:09,600
Doesn't pay.

1786
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:12,440
I mean, it doesn't hurt to be curious.

1787
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:16,540
The massive dumpster of ammo.

1788
01:48:16,660 --> 01:48:17,820
I know it's so great.

1789
01:48:18,480 --> 01:48:21,320
Honestly, just... I feel like I should stick to my revolver.

1790
01:48:21,340 --> 01:48:27,560
because it's it has they give you so much ammo wait hello

1791
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:46,020
for now yeah I guess I guess that's true they're like hey
they're at the beginning of the game your little baby

1792
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:57,100
recognize the parade float I had seen in Bright Falls when I
first arrived I did see that I did I did see that what was

1793
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:05,820
that was a spooky sound don't like there anything in here no
okay

1794
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:22,160
I'm hearing such a spooky noise something's creaking after
the insanity I just experienced in the darkness the lights

1795
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:27,660
of the gas station felt comforting at least for a moment the
same world reasserted itself

1796
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:34,720
My manuscript.

1797
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:38,880
I guess we'll read the pages after.

1798
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:39,660
I don't want to get...

1799
01:49:39,660 --> 01:49:40,120
I don't know.

1800
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:41,280
What is like...

1801
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:43,140
Well, I guess there's no proper way to play it.

1802
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:44,820
But like, what is like the...

1803
01:49:44,820 --> 01:49:46,420
What do people prefer?

1804
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:48,620
Do you prefer that I read it and get kind of spoiled?

1805
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:51,760
Or do you prefer that I wait until the full episode's done?

1806
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:56,000
The point is to read them immediately.

1807
01:49:56,480 --> 01:49:57,180
Oh, okay, okay.

1808
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:58,180
Then let's do that.

1809
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:00,600
The cabin on Cauldron Lake, she asked.

1810
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:07,860
looked at me suspiciously the early morning light flooded
through the office windows I would probably never have

1811
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:13,100
gotten out of the woods alive without her help but I
couldn't tell her the truth of what I'd face the previous

1812
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:19,220
night she think I was lying or crazy she'd lock me up I mean
he wrote and she wouldn't help me find Alice I guess that's

1813
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:26,500
fair well you know I don't know Stucky spat on the garage
floor and tried to shake the cobwebs from his head ever

1814
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:32,720
since the couple never showed to pick up the keys things had
been fuzzy something a feeling caught his attention.

1815
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:38,360
Stucky looked up and stared as his brain tried in vain to
process the horror before him.

1816
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:41,040
He stumbled back, knocking over a can of oil.

1817
01:50:41,680 --> 01:50:47,980
A black pool spread across the floor while he struggled for
a brief moment, then let go as the unrelenting darkness

1818
01:50:47,980 --> 01:50:48,620
engulfed him.

1819
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:50,040
Oh no, he got like possessed.

1820
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:58,700
So we got all of them, minus the things that are for
nightmare mode only, so that's cool.

1821
01:50:58,700 --> 01:51:08,220
the deer fest had been two weeks away when we arrived if the
day count on the banner was right i was missing a whole week

1822
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:19,600
between the night we got here and now the game heard about
mince smile anti-spoiler method it went bad right what am i

1823
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:27,980
focusing on okay i'm just looking around a bit oh they're
almost hmm

1824
01:51:32,940 --> 01:51:35,040
So we're about to meet the cop, I guess?

1825
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:37,640
We did say that we would...

1826
01:51:37,640 --> 01:51:39,920
That we go into the gas station and we read the...

1827
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:41,640
Or we watch the TV and it's freaky.

1828
01:51:45,380 --> 01:51:46,900
The garage was a mess.

1829
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,180
It looked like someone had trashed the place.

1830
01:51:49,680 --> 01:51:51,080
Or that there'd been some kind of fight.

1831
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:53,700
Yeah, yeah, that's what we read in the...

1832
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:54,760
In the...

1833
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,160
In the...

1834
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:55,700
What's it called?

1835
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:56,400
The note.

1836
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:58,120
In the manuscript.

1837
01:51:58,340 --> 01:51:59,020
I'm so sorry.

1838
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:00,080
It's not a note.

1839
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,040
It's much more intelligent than that.

1840
01:52:02,860 --> 01:52:03,940
I'll keep writing.

1841
01:52:04,700 --> 01:52:11,020
outside there's only darkness outside the cabin outside the
story there's only darkness I can feel a presence in the

1842
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:17,960
dark just now I can smell the perfume in the room I'll reach
her I'll fix it up I'll bring her back the story will come

01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:21,380
I'm very curious what Bucktooth Charlie could be.

1855
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:24,840
That's the whole...

1856
01:54:25,360 --> 01:54:26,660
That's the whole act.

1857
01:54:28,180 --> 01:54:29,440
Phantasmagoria, what is this?

1858
01:54:29,500 --> 01:54:31,720

Oh, I'm reading this.

1863
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:41,560
I thought I was reading the candy.

1864
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,420
I was like...

1865
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:43,940

Cow feet.

01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:58,420

01:55:50,020 --> 01:55:50,800
Don't fall asleep.

1887
01:55:51,020 --> 01:55:53,460
Have you seen Stucky, the guy who owns this place?

1888
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:57,200
I realized I couldn't tell her what had happened in the
forest.

1889
01:55:57,900 --> 01:55:58,880
She wouldn't have believed me.

1890
01:55:59,420 --> 01:56:00,980
And then she wouldn't have helped me with Alice.

1891
01:56:01,220 --> 01:56:02,240
That's why we lie.

1892
01:56:02,760 --> 01:56:04,160
That's why we're a big old liar.

1893
01:56:04,580 --> 01:56:07,300
Yeah, I murdered him out in the lumberyard.

1894
01:56:22,900 --> 01:56:25,620
Wait, there's no island?

1895
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,280
Oh.

1896
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:29,020

01:58:54,280 --> 01:59:00,000
So, I think because I've been going a little bit with longer
streams, we'll take it easy today.

1930
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:00,840
We'll end it here.

1931
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:04,400
Maybe next time we can get through two and a half hours.

1932
01:59:04,420 --> 01:59:13,260
three episodes two and three depending on how long they are
so yeah wait oh sorry i took control with my mouse

1934
01:59:27,120 --> 01:59:36,940
particular set of skills my skills my skills more plug for
Minto visiting Washington someday.

1935
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,300
Yeah, should I visit Washington?

1936
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:41,060
Should I?

1937
01:59:41,940 --> 01:59:42,460
Should I?

1938
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:43,120
Should I?

1939
01:59:44,220 --> 01:59:45,460
Let's move.

1940
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:47,200
I'm gonna shooom.

1941
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:49,920
And we're gonna boom.

1942
01:59:51,420 --> 01:59:53,280
And I'm gonna one second.

1943
01:59:53,780 --> 01:59:55,300
I'm gonna clean up a little bit.

1944
01:59:55,660 --> 01:59:56,440
Let's see.

1945
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:21,230
We're here at my desk and my giant coffee.

1946
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:35,730
everybody my giant coffee let's put on some music amazing
music that was so fun I it did spook me a little bit but I

1947
02:00:35,730 --> 02:00:51,230
think because it's not survival horror I feel more what's
the word more inclined to attack I'm like okay I'm here to

1948
02:00:51,250 --> 02:00:59,630
fight baby it's action horror for sure yeah yeah yeah the
resources are there for you yeah there were resources all

1949
02:00:59,630 --> 02:01:09,250
the time i'm sure it will get less and less but um it was
pretty cool i love that it's very twin peaks okay i'll be

1950
02:01:09,250 --> 02:01:14,930
honest i've never watched twin peaks before it's definitely
probably breaking bad is like a series that i would like to

1951
02:01:14,930 --> 02:01:27,690
watch i know about it but you know But it's also, like, I
mean, very obviously Twin Peaks inspired and Twilight Zone

1952
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:29,250
inspired and...

1953
02:01:29,930 --> 02:01:29,950
Yeah!

1954
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:36,800
On nightmare mode, it's very rough.

1955
02:01:37,140 --> 02:01:37,840
I believe that.

1956
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:41,460
I'm so curious what the notes say, though, that are...

1957
02:01:41,460 --> 02:01:43,740
I feel kind of like... I'm like, hey, wait a second.

1958
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,960
Um, why is it...

1959
02:01:46,900 --> 02:01:47,340
Why?

1960
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,500
Why... I should be able to read those notes if I want to.

1961
02:01:52,240 --> 02:01:53,940
I should be able... There should be a way...

1962
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:57,500
Like, if I want to get the notes, I have to do a special
challenge, but...

1963
02:01:57,500 --> 02:01:58,060
I don't know.

1964
02:01:59,160 --> 02:02:00,580
Thank you for checking out episode 1!

1965
02:02:00,700 --> 02:02:04,280
If you enjoyed how silly the game is, I promise it only gets
dumber and sillier each episode.

1966
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:05,620
Let's go!

1967
02:02:07,200 --> 02:02:08,720
The notes are kind of spoilers.

1968
02:02:08,840 --> 02:02:09,860
You're meant to beat the game first.

1969
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:12,300
Oh, the one's a nightmare.

1970
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,040
Isn't Twin Peaks a booby bar?

1971
02:02:19,120 --> 02:02:23,740
Has anybody ever been to the booby bar, Twin Peaks?

1972
02:02:25,560 --> 02:02:26,760
You mean manuscripts?

1973
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,180
Oh, yes, the manuscripts.

1974
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:37,220
When we were in Orlando, there was, there was like, I had a
goal.

1975
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:49,080
I had a goal because the previous time that I went to
Orlando, Florida, I tried to go to Hooters with some

1976
02:02:49,080 --> 02:02:49,980
friends.

1977
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,080
I'm sorry, my wife.

1978
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,180
I was busy in here, wretching in a car.

1979
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:53,660
What?

1980
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,380
Orgar, are you okay?

1981
02:02:57,420 --> 02:02:59,300
I hope you're just car sick.

1982
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:00,600
I hope you feel better.

1983
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:01,560
Oh my gosh.

1984
02:03:03,420 --> 02:03:12,740
But there was, I remember being, we were outside the Hooters
the previous time, like the time before the last time I went

1985
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,640
to Orlando, Florida.

1986
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:26,180
And I remember because we couldn't go in because it was
really, It was like a strange, like, I don't know, there

1987
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:28,140
were like so many people for some reason.

1988
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:32,540
I think it was that like one party essentially took up the
entire restaurant.

1989
02:03:32,680 --> 02:03:35,040
They were like, it's a party of like 30 people.

1990
02:03:35,560 --> 02:03:37,460
You're going to have to wait a really long time.

1991
02:03:37,580 --> 02:03:39,340
And we were like, we're so hungry.

1992
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:45,600
And I remember watching, oh my God, it was a really short
girl.

1993
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:52,240
And she had the biggest dog dogs I've ever seen.

1994
02:03:53,960 --> 02:04:07,960
like seven plates and I was like this place is what this how
how does a place like this exist and I was like oh my god we

1995
02:04:07,960 --> 02:04:12,980
gotta go we're being did not no I'll wait forever for you

1996
02:04:16,300 --> 02:04:25,600
and so I was like oh man I really hope we can go back to
Hooters this last trip and we almost went And I don't, I'm

1997
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:26,440
not going to name names.

1998
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:32,520
I'm not going to say who denied us the beauty of, but they
made a good point.

1999
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:41,060
She was like, I don't want to go to a restaurant that's
really loud and full of like crazy people.

2000
02:04:41,840 --> 02:04:42,760
I don't want to go to a bar.

2001
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:45,840
I want to just relax and eat pizza.

2002
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:48,560
So I get it.

2003
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,920
But at the same time, I was hoping she would be there.

2004
02:04:52,360 --> 02:04:53,460
My short stack queen.

2005
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:55,400
I'll always remember you.

2006
02:04:56,280 --> 02:04:57,960
And I've never been to a Hooters before!

2007
02:04:58,980 --> 02:05:04,020
I've never been to a Hooters before, so I've always just
been, like, so curious what it's like.

2008
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:05,640
I don't even like wings.

2009
02:05:05,980 --> 02:05:08,720
I heard that that's the only reason to go, but...

2010
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,100
Truly America's Maid Cafe.

2011
02:05:10,300 --> 02:05:17,780
And what kind of maid would I be if I could not go to the
American Maid Cafe?

2012
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:20,900
What kind of maid cafe connoisseur would I be?

2013
02:05:21,200 --> 02:05:21,440
Huh?

2014
02:05:24,220 --> 02:05:25,980
Their fried pickles are pretty good.

2015
02:05:26,580 --> 02:05:28,040
See, I love fried pickles.

2016
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:30,420
You're already selling it to me.

2017
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,280
You are already selling it to me.

2018
02:05:36,680 --> 02:05:39,160
That's like insane gotcha look right there.

2019
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:44,140
Oh, man.

2020
02:05:50,320 --> 02:05:52,140
Now you have to go for work.

2021
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:54,660
It's market research, everybody.

2022
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:58,380
Peppergun, welcome to Vemboosh.

2023
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:58,880

2024
02:05:59,080 --> 02:05:59,640
Thank you.

2025
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:00,620
Thank you.

2026
02:06:04,300 --> 02:06:07,460
I don't think Mint would fit in their uniforms.

2027
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:11,380
This is kind of a Hooter's uniform, is it no?

2028
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:15,140
Kind of.

2029
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:16,600
Maybe.

2030
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:21,200
Don't they wear like a tank top and shorts?

2031
02:06:33,450 --> 02:06:34,510
Minus the Hooters.

2032
02:06:35,410 --> 02:06:50,270
Sorry, I don't have birds in my room oh my gosh we're
shaming me i own cats and not birds i'm sorry we all deserve

2033
02:06:50,270 --> 02:07:00,150
a short stack queen in our life yeah could you make it a
vlog about it like the other mid cafe me vlogging my first

2034
02:07:00,150 --> 02:07:09,590
time at pooters the american mid cafe Do you think if I
asked them to bless my food, they would?

2035
02:07:10,650 --> 02:07:12,930
Hooters, Minto collab when we'd all go.

2036
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:17,370
Minto needs to get a gray parrot.

2037
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:18,870
I need to get my own Apollo.

2038
02:07:19,470 --> 02:07:27,330
I've heard from parrot owners that like, parrots are, like,
because I've thought about it, like I love watching parrot

2039
02:07:27,330 --> 02:07:33,470
videos, but I think it's similar to like, you know, you
watch a baby video and you're like, ah, but that doesn't

2040
02:07:33,470 --> 02:07:39,530
necessarily mean mean you want the baby you know what i mean
so i've watched parrot videos and i'm like ah maybe i want a

2041
02:07:39,530 --> 02:07:46,390
parrot and then i hear that they are just like toddlers like
they are they are so much work and be ready for all your

2042
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:55,730
things to be chewed on and all the noise and all the mess
and everything and they live forever like twin peaks is kind

2043
02:07:55,730 --> 02:08:02,150
of hooters but more flannel wait that's even better i love
flannel jean short shorts as i recall went for a work lunch

2044
02:08:02,150 --> 02:08:06,690
once we just got all Billy with my Catholic good boy
co-worker.

2045
02:08:07,050 --> 02:08:08,530
What is so awkward?

2046
02:08:09,870 --> 02:08:11,170
They can touch you?

2047
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:14,950
Did you gain a tale in your afterlife journey?

2048
02:08:17,070 --> 02:08:18,410
What do you mean by that?

2049
02:08:21,930 --> 02:08:23,230
Go to Twin Peaks.

2050
02:08:23,350 --> 02:08:25,190
Maybe I should go to Twin Peaks instead, then.

2051
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:31,530
They're loud, smart, social, and needy.

2052
02:08:31,650 --> 02:08:33,570
Wait, needy is so cute, though.

2053
02:08:35,530 --> 02:08:37,430
attacking my PC mouse.

2054
02:08:38,990 --> 02:08:46,530
I want one so badly, but at the same time, I think with the
way that I stream for like long hours, it might be kind of

2055
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:47,030
difficult.

2056
02:08:47,710 --> 02:08:54,130
Unless I had like my parrot in my room and like you could
hear him or something.

2057
02:08:54,910 --> 02:08:55,930
Cats are so easy.

2058
02:08:56,130 --> 02:09:01,190
They're very self-reliant,

2059
02:09:04,410 --> 02:09:07,510
it would be so I would be playing and you just hear

2060
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:15,370
Bredded dragon You mean a bearded dragon?

2061
02:09:17,950 --> 02:09:29,810
I want a bearded dragon so badly I used to have a leopard
gecko and then my teacher when I was in elementary school

2062
02:09:30,050 --> 02:09:41,950
elementary school for you humans the over the holidays she
would let you take home the bearded dragon and so I got to

2063
02:09:41,950 --> 02:09:54,490
take him home for Christmas once and and I I I dressed him
up in like as like a Santa Claus and everything it was so

2064
02:09:54,490 --> 02:10:01,450
good my family have a great parrot he's a unique member of
the family but he is a lot of work a lot of noise and he

2065
02:10:01,450 --> 02:10:03,850
bites They also need a lot of company.

2066
02:10:04,330 --> 02:10:05,910
Oh, this sounds so fun.

2067
02:10:06,030 --> 02:10:06,370
I know.

2068
02:10:06,710 --> 02:10:09,030
They're like, it sounds so great.

2069
02:10:10,150 --> 02:10:11,890
And like the videos are so cute.

2070
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:13,830
And then you're just like, there's so much work.

2071
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:16,070
They are very much, much work.

2072
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:18,870
And like, like I love there's this one bird that I watch
sometimes.

2073
02:10:18,990 --> 02:10:26,430
I can't remember his name, but he loves to go into the
cabinet of like where they keep the cups and stuff.

2074
02:10:26,550 --> 02:10:29,270
And they only have plastic cups because of this bird.

2075
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:38,750
to knock them all outside of like he likes to like throw
them on the ground essentially and they're like but but he

2076
02:10:38,750 --> 02:10:49,050
gets the most satisfaction when the when his parents like
act like it's a bad thing so he'll like be he'll be pushing

2077
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:57,170
the cups out of the cabinet and they're like oh my gosh
don't Oh my gosh!

2078
02:10:57,310 --> 02:11:02,450
And he's just like, and he'll go and knock another one out.

2079
02:11:03,610 --> 02:11:04,690
My name is Mito Phantom.

2080
02:11:05,230 --> 02:11:05,930
I'm a meadow.

2081
02:11:08,310 --> 02:11:10,070
I got to take home a class.

2082
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:12,410
Tarantula over the summer!

2083
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:15,330
I want to do.

2084
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:21,950
You say cats are easy, but I just moved house and my cat has
been glued to me for days.

2085
02:11:23,650 --> 02:11:25,870
Okay, I have to confess something a little bit.

2086
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:26,090
it.

2087
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:28,450
I have to confess a little bit.

2088
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:34,030
Today I started stream a half hour later than I was supposed
to, than I intended.

2089
02:11:35,350 --> 02:11:38,250
Before then, my migraine was coming back a little bit, so I
took a nap.

2090
02:11:39,070 --> 02:11:43,130
And when I woke up, my cat paused.

2091
02:11:43,890 --> 02:11:45,550
She never cuddles with me.

2092
02:11:46,230 --> 02:11:49,250
And she cuddled up by my leg.

2093
02:11:51,130 --> 02:11:53,970
And so I wanted to stay in bed for a little bit longer.

2094
02:11:57,090 --> 02:12:03,750
And I couldn't move And so I just wanted to stay with my cat

2095
02:12:07,330 --> 02:12:21,210
I wanted to stay with my cat Because she never cuddles with
me 100% forgiven I was so I can't even explain to you guys

2096
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:29,070
how happy I was I was like no way She's She's Because she
jumped up on the bed, and I kind of was like, come here,

2097
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:29,650
come here.

2098
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:31,690
And then she actually listened.

2099
02:12:31,870 --> 02:12:32,630
She's very...

2100
02:12:32,630 --> 02:12:34,430
Oh, that was my controller disconnecting, sorry.

2101
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:35,630
Totally worse.

2102
02:12:41,660 --> 02:12:42,780
Yeah, so...

2103
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:46,180
I was so happy.

2104
02:12:47,980 --> 02:12:49,940
Is it you that had a cat you regret getting?

2105
02:12:50,620 --> 02:12:50,920
No.

2106
02:12:52,720 --> 02:12:54,200
Sounds like someone else.

2107
02:12:54,480 --> 02:12:55,300
Not guilty.

2108
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:58,680
Did that carrier...

2109
02:12:58,700 --> 02:13:09,760

2114
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:59,280
Have you tried eating catnip?

2115
02:13:59,420 --> 02:13:59,800
Like me?

2116
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:00,820
Eat the catnip!

2117
02:14:04,760 --> 02:14:05,080
No.

2118
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,480
What does catnip taste like?

2119
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:09,340
I mean, probably just like grass, right?

2120
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:11,800
Dried grass?

2121
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:15,640
I haven't eaten grass once.

2122
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:16,520
It's not good.

2123
02:14:20,350 --> 02:14:23,350
Isn't that one of those bamboozled flavors is grass?

2124
02:14:26,370 --> 02:14:27,710
That game is evil.

2125
02:14:28,150 --> 02:14:38,390
Have you heard of like some of the flavors that game has

Oh, yeah, used bandage.

2130
02:15:07,690 --> 02:15:08,810
Used bandage.

2131
02:15:09,110 --> 02:15:09,630
That's foul.

2132
02:15:09,850 --> 02:15:11,030
Who's coming up with this?

2133
02:15:11,970 --> 02:15:13,330
Rip to the taste testers.

2134
02:15:13,570 --> 02:15:14,210
Oh, my God.

2135
02:15:14,570 --> 02:15:15,750
What do they put in there?

2136
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:20,530
Like, oh, my God, I just opened up my phone and it was Keanu
Reeves' real name.

2137
02:15:20,850 --> 02:15:21,170
Let's see.

2138
02:15:22,050 --> 02:15:23,490
Bean boozled.

2139
02:15:26,790 --> 02:15:27,250
Let's see.

2140
02:15:27,890 --> 02:15:29,030
Liver and onions.

2141
02:15:29,850 --> 02:15:32,670
looks the same as cappuccino.

2142
02:15:34,070 --> 02:15:36,890
Old bandage looks the same as pomegranate.

2143
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:40,690
Rotten egg looks the same as buttered popcorn.

2144
02:15:41,890 --> 02:15:44,230
Toothpaste, that one's not bad, that's just minty.

2145
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:46,530
Looks the same as berry blue.

2146
02:15:47,870 --> 02:15:48,070
What?

2147
02:15:48,610 --> 02:15:49,670
Toothpaste isn't bad.

2148
02:15:50,210 --> 02:15:53,170
You literally have to stick that in your mouth to brush your
teeth.

2149
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:56,830
Popcorn is also bad.

2150
02:15:56,830 --> 02:16:02,290
I think the buttered, probably the like fake buttered flavor
might make me feel sick.

2151
02:16:02,770 --> 02:16:05,570
I kind of want to know how people know what old bandages
taste like.

2152
02:16:06,610 --> 02:16:11,870
And the fact that the old bandage bean boozle, like the
little bean, is red.

2153
02:16:12,190 --> 02:16:13,250
It's so disgusting.

2154
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:17,030
Barf looks the same as peach.

2155
02:16:17,790 --> 02:16:20,870
Stink bug looks the same as toasted marshmallow.

2156
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:24,170
Bougar looks the same as juicy pear.

2157
02:16:25,230 --> 02:16:26,270
Dirty dishwasher.

2158
02:16:26,830 --> 02:16:29,210
Looks the same as a birthday cake.

2159
02:16:30,210 --> 02:16:32,290
Stinky socks looks the same as Toothie Fruity.

2160
02:16:32,890 --> 02:16:34,070
And dead fish.

2161
02:16:35,070 --> 02:16:38,470
Looks the same as strawberry banana smoothie.

2162
02:16:40,330 --> 02:16:43,510
And you know the worst part about this image that I'm
looking at?

2163
02:16:44,390 --> 02:16:49,710
The very bottom says, naturally and artificially flavored.

2164
02:16:50,570 --> 02:16:52,970
Which means some of these are naturally flavored.

2165
02:16:54,510 --> 02:16:56,190
They don't say which ones.

2166
02:16:57,370 --> 02:17:01,920
Sure, you could assume that it's just the yummy flavors,
but...

2167
02:17:06,450 --> 02:17:07,070
But...

2168
02:17:07,070 --> 02:17:09,090
What if...

2169
02:17:09,970 --> 02:17:12,250
What would your gross flavor creation be?

2170
02:17:12,390 --> 02:17:14,990
I think I'd go for mysterious shower drain clump.

2171
02:17:15,390 --> 02:17:15,770
Eww!

2172
02:17:17,090 --> 02:17:18,330
That's disgusting.

2173
02:17:19,850 --> 02:17:21,830
I don't even want to think about it.

2174
02:17:21,870 --> 02:17:22,990
It makes me gag.

2175
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:25,970
It's so horrible.

2176
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:32,210
Spoiled milk

2177
02:17:35,230 --> 02:17:45,150
Sewer right Maybe I would do like Bottom of a shoe or
something like that Where it's gross But like the name

2178
02:17:45,150 --> 02:17:49,610
itself doesn't make me Doesn't make me shiver

2179
02:17:53,090 --> 02:17:58,370
Ectoplasm Hey That's delicious What are you talking about?

2180
02:18:03,630 --> 02:18:04,910
Ectoplasmic spire.

2181
02:18:06,630 --> 02:18:07,870
Shoes aren't that dirty.

2182
02:18:08,510 --> 02:18:08,710
Uh-oh.

2183
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:10,610
I don't know about that.

2184
02:18:12,290 --> 02:18:12,970
Maybe...

2185
02:18:12,970 --> 02:18:17,010
Just take one walk down the sidewalk of New York City.

2186
02:18:17,790 --> 02:18:20,250
And then say your shoes aren't that disgusting.

2187
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:26,810
Seattle Gum Walk.

2188
02:18:26,830 --> 02:18:28,010
What is that?

2189
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:29,170
Is that famous?

2190
02:18:31,790 --> 02:18:32,310
Ectoplasm.

2191
02:18:32,570 --> 02:18:37,170
Do you clean your shoes?

2192
02:18:37,790 --> 02:18:38,590
I don't think so.

2193
02:18:38,850 --> 02:18:39,030
No.

2194
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:42,250
I mean, I wipe them off before I go into the main cafe.

2195
02:18:43,230 --> 02:18:44,390
And I take them off.

2196
02:18:45,590 --> 02:18:46,450
Once I'm inside.

2197
02:18:48,390 --> 02:18:48,910
So...

2198
02:18:49,650 --> 02:18:51,730
People lick the Seattle gum wall.

2199
02:18:52,010 --> 02:18:53,510
What is the Seattle gum wall?

2200
02:18:56,830 --> 02:19:03,610
Google, Seattle, Seattle, Seattle, I can't type, Seattle
Gumwall.

2201
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:07,550
Holy!

2202
02:19:08,310 --> 02:19:09,950
Oh my god!

2203
02:19:23,030 --> 02:19:24,930
Why does this exist?

2204
02:19:28,590 --> 02:19:30,290
What the hell?

2205
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:37,700
It kind of reminds me of how, like, people kiss Marilyn
Monroe.

2206
02:19:37,720 --> 02:19:43,440
Monroe's grave, which I'm like so many people are, are
kissing that thing.

2207
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:44,880
You're gonna get something.

2208
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:48,500
I'm so sorry, Minta didn't mean to teach you this.

2209
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,120
Why is this like a tradition?

2210
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:52,920
Why does that have to be gum?

2211
02:19:54,280 --> 02:19:57,960
Why can't it be the Seattle gum wrapper wall?

2212
02:19:58,220 --> 02:20:01,380
Like, it doesn't have to be actual gum.

2213
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:02,740
It could be the wrapper.

2214
02:20:03,220 --> 02:20:04,340
That would be even prettier.

2215
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:08,560
Eww!

2216
02:20:12,350 --> 02:20:14,670
We just had the damn wall cleaned up too.

2217
02:20:16,350 --> 02:20:18,750
What about kissing the blarney stone?

2218
02:20:19,530 --> 02:20:21,530
That's in, uh, what's it called?

2219
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:23,210
Ireland, right?

2220
02:20:24,170 --> 02:20:27,010
What is, that gives you luck supposed to, right?

2221
02:20:27,770 --> 02:20:28,610
Blarney stone.

2222
02:20:28,730 --> 02:20:29,310
I heard, I, wait.

2223
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:35,270
I've heard, I've seen that it's like really small.

2224
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:39,550
Or something like, you have to, or rather you have to do
something really small.

2225
02:20:39,570 --> 02:20:51,590
strange for it like don't they like hang you off a side of a
cliff or something like as an irish man it does in fact give

2226
02:20:51,590 --> 02:21:07,850
luck and something else you have to lean backwards too many
kisses wearing it out over the years so if you got too many

2227
02:21:07,850 --> 02:21:13,490
kisses would your lips fall off would your lips disappear

2228
02:21:18,030 --> 02:21:28,930
my friend did that when he went to ireland i would never
let's test it you want to try it regrows oh okay humans are

2229
02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:35,390
like lizards that's the best good good

2230
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:41,830
Did you answer this after all the kissing practice?

2231
02:21:42,010 --> 02:21:43,670
Okay, it was only a couple times.

2232
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:45,930
How many times...

2233
02:21:45,930 --> 02:21:47,590
That should be a Mythbusters episode.

2234
02:21:48,070 --> 02:21:49,910
Bring back Mythbusters so we can see.

2235
02:21:50,230 --> 02:21:55,750
How many times do you have to be kissed for your lips to
fall off?

2236
02:21:56,630 --> 02:21:59,010
Supposed to give the gift of gab.

2237
02:21:59,530 --> 02:22:00,430
What is the gift of gab?

2238
02:22:01,010 --> 02:22:03,670
But yeah, you lie down and slide over the edge a bit.

2239
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:04,970
Really not that scary.

2240
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,350
Been there.

2241
02:22:05,450 --> 02:22:06,850
You did it!

2242
02:22:14,400 --> 02:22:15,980
It's not really a myth, Minkid.

2243
02:22:16,340 --> 02:22:18,200
Oh, it's science.

2244
02:22:18,620 --> 02:22:27,180
Okay, well, I'm gonna make my own show called Science
Experiments.

2245
02:22:28,360 --> 02:22:29,080
Explorers.

2246
02:22:29,620 --> 02:22:38,340
Explorers of science, the experiments that are, they could
be myths, but they're not.

2247
02:22:39,560 --> 02:22:41,500
But we still bust them.

2248
02:22:47,810 --> 02:22:49,190
That's the full title.

2249
02:22:49,510 --> 02:22:51,090
It's actually a light novel.

2250
02:22:51,350 --> 02:22:53,250
It will be turned into an anime next season.

2251
02:22:53,610 --> 02:22:54,950
Please watch my...

2252
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:56,450

Please watch my show.

Spectral Science featuring Mint Phantom.

2255
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:10,370
Hey, stop trying to workshop my name here, okay?

2256
02:23:11,570 --> 02:23:12,430
Of course...

2257
02:23:12,430 --> 02:23:13,630
Wait, what was the name again?

2258
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:14,790
Uh...

2259
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:16,610
What was it?

2260
02:23:16,970 --> 02:23:18,130
What did we call it?

2261
02:23:20,230 --> 02:23:21,090
Spectral... Wait, no.

2262
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:22,230
That wasn't Spectral Science.

2263
02:23:22,390 --> 02:23:22,870
That's the fault.

2264
02:23:23,030 --> 02:23:24,950
That's the knockoff show.

2265
02:23:25,830 --> 02:23:28,250
The one that really rolls off the tongue well.

2266
02:23:31,110 --> 02:23:34,050
Make a show where they break all the bad theories.

2267
02:23:34,370 --> 02:23:34,990
Oh my gosh!

2268
02:23:35,070 --> 02:23:38,010
I heard something recently that, like...

2269
02:23:38,810 --> 02:23:40,730
There's a... There's a bean.

2270
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:45,610
There's a bean in Breaking Bad that, like, they used to
poison...

2271
02:23:46,050 --> 02:23:49,150
They were trying to poison somebody with the bean.

2272
02:23:50,630 --> 02:23:52,670
And apparently people...

2273
02:23:52,670 --> 02:23:54,890
It does not work that way in real life.

2274
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:56,930
But apparently people...

2275
02:23:56,930 --> 02:23:57,790
Yeah, the ricin.

2276
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,790
The ricin.

2277
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:03,590
People were trying it in real life to poison people with the
bean.

2278
02:24:05,090 --> 02:24:05,910
And it didn't work.

2279
02:24:07,090 --> 02:24:07,670
Because...

2280
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:08,330
It's...

2281
02:24:09,150 --> 02:24:09,730
It's...

2282
02:24:09,730 --> 02:24:10,670
Hollywood, baby.

2283
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:12,490
It's all dramatized.

2284
02:24:13,690 --> 02:24:14,770
Death by bean.

2285
02:24:15,570 --> 02:24:15,770
Oh!

2286
02:24:16,050 --> 02:24:16,410
Sorry.

2287
02:24:20,010 --> 02:24:20,730
Sorry.

2288
02:24:23,390 --> 02:24:25,390
Testing myths and science in another world?

2289
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:29,810
Maybe we go to Breaking Bad World.

2290
02:24:32,970 --> 02:24:34,530
Thankfully it doesn't work.

2291
02:24:34,830 --> 02:24:42,430
Yeah, that's why you should never show someone how to
actually make a bomb or actually poison someone on TV

2292
02:24:42,430 --> 02:24:44,370
because people are gonna try it.

2293
02:24:44,370 --> 02:24:47,750
They were like, Breaking Bad is so realistic.

2294
02:24:48,530 --> 02:24:50,390
The Ryzen, it's gotta work.

2295
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:52,410
That Ryzen Bane.

2296
02:24:59,630 --> 02:25:01,850
In the Saul Gumblin verse.

2297
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:09,800
Don't watch Dr. Stone then.

2298
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:12,080
Do they really?

2299
02:25:13,880 --> 02:25:15,500
They tell you how?

2300
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:19,820
Rice and bean, rice and bean.

2301
02:25:20,540 --> 02:25:22,040
Wait, that sounds kind of good.

2302
02:25:22,200 --> 02:25:23,780
I want some rice and beans right now.

2303
02:25:29,190 --> 02:25:32,510
You gotta watch the Breaking Bad Mythbusters episodes.

2304
02:25:32,790 --> 02:25:34,950
They actually tell you how to dissolve a human body.

2305
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:35,930
Wait, is that real?

2306
02:25:44,180 --> 02:25:44,860
That's real?

2307
02:25:45,960 --> 02:25:46,560
It's real.

2308
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:49,340
Don't accept beans from strangers, people.

2309
02:25:49,520 --> 02:25:51,100
Yeah, it could be bean boozled.

2310
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,260
And you could be getting...

2311
02:25:55,580 --> 02:25:57,800
You could be getting stink bug.

2312
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:01,880
You could think that it's delicious toasting marshmallow.

2313
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:04,700
But no, it's stink bug.

2314
02:26:05,640 --> 02:26:07,520
You just got bean boozled.

2315
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:11,640
Minto love yippee.

2316
02:26:12,520 --> 02:26:13,240
Thank you.

2317
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:15,160
Thank you so much for four months.

2318
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:18,700
Who is Alan Wake?

2319
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:19,840
He's an author.

2320
02:26:22,060 --> 02:26:24,120
Honestly, I want to play more already.

2321
02:26:25,380 --> 02:26:38,640
but I will resist I will resist until next week obviously
he's a writer what did I say did I say author my bad I I

2322
02:26:38,640 --> 02:26:41,880
elevated his title

2323
02:26:48,780 --> 02:26:56,940
author but he specifically says writer I'm a writer I take
out I'm a yapper.

2324
02:26:58,240 --> 02:26:59,260
I could say talker.

2325
02:27:03,880 --> 02:27:05,180
Oh my goodness.

2326
02:27:06,820 --> 02:27:09,580
Happy New Year, me and dog.

2327
02:27:09,700 --> 02:27:10,780
Here's to another year of fun.

2328
02:27:11,140 --> 02:27:13,460
Chris, thank you so much for 20 months.

2329
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:14,320
Thank you.

2330
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:17,440
Happy New Year.

2331
02:27:17,940 --> 02:27:19,920
Can't believe they made a berry-flavored bean.

2332
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:22,040
Why would it...

2333
02:27:22,040 --> 02:27:23,060
Oh, the stink bug?

2334
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:23,820
Oh, yeah.

2335
02:27:24,600 --> 02:27:25,040
Nasty.

2336
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:29,800
A virtual tuber.

2337
02:27:31,540 --> 02:27:33,980
I'm stuck here in the virtual world.

2338
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:35,580
I'm stuck in the virtual.

2339
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:38,660
What is real?

2340
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:42,260
Is my wife still even here?

2341
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,320
I'm already so immersed in the story.

2342
02:27:45,460 --> 02:27:46,120
I want to keep playing.

2343
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:49,380
But for now, I will.

2344
02:27:50,340 --> 02:27:52,620
I will leave you all here.

2345
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,020
Thank you guys for hanging out with me.

2346
02:27:55,160 --> 02:27:56,420
I really, really appreciate it.

Thanks for the stream.

2356
02:28:41,730 --> 02:28:44,090
Make sure to drink some tea or coffee so you're wide awake.

2357
02:28:44,990 --> 02:28:48,590
Wait, so you're wide-eyed and awake for the collab.

2358
02:28:48,750 --> 02:28:49,390
See you in the next.

2359
02:28:49,610 --> 02:28:50,270

Some...

2363
02:28:54,770 --> 02:28:56,150
Some drink for my throat.

2364
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:00,370
Kitabakari!

2365
02:29:02,790 --> 02:29:06,090
Is the Tensetsu BC's quiz over custody of Barry?

2366
02:29:06,390 --> 02:29:07,270
Or reverse custody?

2367
02:29:07,750 --> 02:29:08,910
Your turn to take the Barry.

2368
02:29:10,530 --> 02:29:14,250
What if Barry and I leave our respective groups and elope?

2369
02:29:20,110 --> 02:29:21,790
Nerala, thank you for the pink!

2370
02:29:22,710 --> 02:29:29,870
Close your eyes for a second and imagine a swarm slash pack
slash school of Aibu is rushing to hug you and You hugs us

2371
02:29:29,870 --> 02:29:30,410
all.

2372
02:29:33,130 --> 02:29:35,270
Oh my god, there's so many of you.

2373
02:29:35,530 --> 02:29:36,550
Oh my god, it's terrifying.

2374
02:29:36,830 --> 02:29:37,770
Oh my god, stay back.

2375
02:29:38,810 --> 02:29:39,990
It's a hug.

2376
02:29:40,630 --> 02:29:42,070
Ah, you're so squishy.

2377
02:29:42,610 --> 02:29:44,850
Oh god, there's too many of you.

2378
02:29:46,190 --> 02:29:47,050
I'm drowning.

2379
02:29:54,530 --> 02:29:55,850
I'm dead now.

2380
02:30:03,880 --> 02:30:08,260
How do you drown a ghost with a bunch of other ghosts,
maybe?

2381
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:16,160
Anyway, that was silly.

2382
