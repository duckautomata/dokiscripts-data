1
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,470
Move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it.

2
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,310
Hello!

3
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,410
Hello!

4
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,870
Hi!

5
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,570
Wait, one second, one second.

6
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,210
I'm playing through OBS.

7
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,450
Sorry, everybody.

8
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,410
Weaver saw and then this.

9
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,830
Okay.

10
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:29,050
Wait, is my intro intermediate?

11
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,110
This is embarrassing!

12
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,070
Wait, okay, hold on.

13
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,790
Bo-e-bo-e!

14
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:35,570
Bo-e!

15
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:35,570
Bo-e!

16
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,690
Bo-e-boe!

17
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,370
Go-so-jo-so!

18
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,670
Hello, hello, hello!

19
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,850
Get out of here!

20
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,030
Hello, welcome, welcome!

21
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,930
Sorry if I sound a little far, my mic is right here, so...

22
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:11,190
So I might sound a little far It's a bit of a scuff setup,
but...

23
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,430
Thank you so much!

24
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:24,450
My extra Q3-D-O-C-

25
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,870
Stop it!

26
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,670
Why am I turned so sideways, though?

27
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,150
Hold on.

28
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,810
Everything is always scuffed here, one second.

29
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,730
Wait, maybe it'll be okay when I'm looking at this screen.

30
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,420
I'm just a ghost maid.

31
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,280
Actually, I'm gonna move over just a little bit.

32
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,530
I think that's better.

33
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,230
A big, large, and in charge for the stream.

34
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,170
You can see my body, daddy, daddy.

35
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,850
We're doing it live.

36
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,670
We're doing it live.

37
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,250
How many times will mint flash us?

38
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:29,750
Well, maybe.

39
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,450
Twice or twice.

40
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,350
Sorry.

41
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,810
Well, thank you!

42
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,030
Thank you, Vodacu!

43
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,750
Thank you!

44
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,790
Wait, why am I turned?

45
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,530
Hold on, I'm gonna... We're doing it live.

46
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,330
We're doing it live.

47
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,270
You know what?

48
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:49,790
Screw it.

49
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,750
I'm gonna...

50
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:50,910
Yeah.

51
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,050
Wow.

52
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,100
Maybe like that is better.

53
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,880
I don't know why it acts so funky.

54
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know.

55
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,260
Why it moves me around.

56
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:06,680
Wait.

57
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,230
Oh wait.

58
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,010
Stop

59
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,310
that.

60
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,050
Big!

61
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,250
You're still taller though.

62
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,930
You're still taller than me though.

63
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,290
Up ease!

64
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,090
Up ease!

65
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,250
Shorty.

66
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,310
Okay, I'm bringing you down.

67
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,550
I'm taking you down with me.

68
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,870
Oh, little chat so cute.

69
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,030
Oh, so cute.

70
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:27,950
Oh, so cute.

71
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,510
Oh, look at you.

72
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:29,750
Oh, look at you.

73
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,370
Look at you.

74
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,730
So small.

75
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,570
So small.

76
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,850
Shall we play Warrior War before?

77
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:41,790
3D gets totally cookie.

78
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,170
Um, wait.

79
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:48,630
Rude!

80
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,510
So rude.

81
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,110
Uh, sorry, my computer is like all over the place.

82
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,250
With everything.

83
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:56,730
Okay.

84
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:57,870
Okay.

85
00:09:59,550 --> 00:09:59,790
Okay.

86
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,470
Okay.

87
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,630
Wiggly is phantom and it's my birthday tomorrow!

88
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,830
Shabur!

89
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,350
Happy birthday!

90
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,650
Happy birthday!

92
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:26,690
Okay.

93
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,670
Shall we stop?

94
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,730
I've only played Warrior Wear one time before, so...

95
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:34,710
Uh...

96
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,370
Hopefully you can hear me.

97
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,030
Um...

98
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:39,610
And...

99
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,570
Six-foot dog.

100
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,430
I'll put you, I'll put you guys back up.

101
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,030
And...

102
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:58,870
Today's my birthday, Skellyroll can be bo- Wait, why am I
huge now?

103
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,410
Wait a second.

104
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,230
I keep getting bigger!

105
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,310
Okay, hold on.

106
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,850
Alright, we're here, we're here.

107
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,250
This is- this is fine.

108
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,450
I need to stop jumping around.

109
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,290
It makes me move.

110
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:10,230
You didn't see anything.

111
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,210
No, you didn't.

112
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:13,590
No, you didn't.

113
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
What's a party?

114
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,780
Oh, two to three.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, I mean- a four.

116
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,760
I can read numbers.

117
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,320
Of course, then go with story mode.

118
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,940
Yes, yes, yes.

119
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,960
Four is like my favorite number, too.

120
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,700
What the heck?

121
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Okay.

122
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,480
I have my joy cons.

123
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,520
Left-handed player hold... Oh, I hold eight.

124
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,860
I'm right-handed.

125
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,540
Be aware of your surroundings.

126
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,660
I have

127
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,750
like some decorations on.

128
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,750
I have

129
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,800
some decorations on my fan.

130
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:22,940
Yeah!

131
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,600
Okay, okay.

132
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,000
Or number of player.

133
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,480
Okay, no.

134
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:30,880
Choo-choo!

135
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,180
Okay, okay, okay.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,120
I'm gripping?

137
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,760
Wait, grip with the...

138
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,600
Thumb on ZL.

139
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,020
Thumb on ZL.

140
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,700
This is the grip hole.

141
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,300
What?

142
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,740
I've never played with a grip hold before.

143
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,980
It's Orca's birthday today.

144
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,520
They are being denied a super chat.

145
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,440
Orca!

146
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,980
Sorry, I'm squeaky today too.

147
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,020
My voice is not so great today.

148
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,560
Happy birthday!

149
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,480
Calvo, thank you.

150
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,200
Thank you, thank you.

151
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:18,700
Sorry about that.

152
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,580
if I don't see chat so much because I'm, first of all, I'm
far away from my computer.

153
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:28,700
And then also, I'm playing the game.

154
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,040
I'm playing the game.

155
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,180
So that's Z, let's grip.

156
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,680
Wait, what do I do with my hand?

157
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,360
Okay, grip.

158
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,360
Please use a grip hold while playing.

159
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

160
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,040
Stone cold welcome.

161
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,780
Oh my gosh, I'm gripping it, I'm gripping it.

162
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,380
I hope I can have it.

163
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,720
I have like no headphones or anything.

164
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:57,280
My mic is, my mic setup's out, all messed up.

165
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,480
Out of the way, chumps!

166
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,700
Welcome to the island!

167
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,740
Please take these precious stones as a hello gift.

168
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,800
Diamonds, diamonds, give me, give me diamonds!

169
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,100
They're form stones!

170
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,840
Moving around with these in your hands can bring you good
luck.

171
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,440
Huh?

172
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:13,920
Huh?

173
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,800
Smoking rocks, I don't want them!

174
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,820
So rude.

175
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,720
What did the bird do to you?

176
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:29,400
Oh, wow.

177
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,790
Minto just thinking of the controller.

178
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,550
What are you talking about?

179
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:41,650
What are you guys talking about?

180
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,770
I'm concerned.

181
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,710
I'm concerned.

182
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,630
Those who dare to approach the shrine will be punished.

183
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,030
What is the story?

184
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,430
Was there a vacation then?

185
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:05,590
Choo-choo.

186
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,210
Choo-choo.

187
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,790
Oh my gosh!

188
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,010
The voice from above speaks.

189
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,850
Hold your form stones in your hands.

190
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,430
Keep your arms close to your sides.

191
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,230
And bend your elbows at a right angle.

192
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,430
Your thumbs must be on top.

193
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:23,590
Okay.

194
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:28,870
The voice saw that the people were unready and had them
brace themselves for anything.

195
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,550
This is the origin of Choo Choo.

196
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:33,490
Choo Choo!

197
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,450
A form to survive an absurd endeavor.

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,020

199
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,920

204
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,240

207
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,280
Ring the bells.

208
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,200
Oh, oh.

209
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:11,680
Oops, my bad.

227
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,840
Choo-choo.

228
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,640
Choo-choo.

229
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,070
Yeah?

230
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,490

Whack!

237
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,740
Hang in there!

238
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,680
I gotta fix my camera again.

239
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,920
It's gonna flash everybody.

240
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,760
Look if it happens.

241
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't look if it happens.

242
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,700
Don't look.

243
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,460
You have to avoid your eyes.

244
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,600
One

245
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,470
second.

246
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,430
One second.

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,370
I'm also gonna refresh.

248
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,670

Kuku!

250
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,280
We saw nothing yet.

251
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,920
As you will not see.

252
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,000
Ever.

253
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,520

A ladyfriend!

258
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,900
I respectfully refuse to ignore the gate of heaven.

259
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,600
What do you mean by that?

260
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,520
Wait, don't...

261
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,620
No, you shouldn't...

262

263
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:53,780
This should be fun.

264
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,080
I'm just leaning back.

265
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:57,440
Mermaid meet and greet.

266
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,660
Mermaid meet and greet!

267
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,750

Am I going to be choo-choo-in again?

276
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,530

voice saw its people were defenseless, so it gave them a
sword.

288
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,660
After a few mishaps, it also gave them this form, so they
knew not to hold the pointy end.

289
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,080
Wait, oh, I did it wrong.

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,740
Sky stretch.

334
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,150
Keep the flame lit.

335
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,030
Keep the flame lit.

336
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:46,250
Oh.

337
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:52,980

00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,860
Fire the cannon.

342
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,930

Okay, we can do this.

345
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,620
We can do this.

346
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,500
This is tough.

347
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,420
This is tough.

348
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,800
Keep the flame lit.

349
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,020
I realized too I was holding it like outward rather than
inward.

350
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,800
Like you're supposed to grip it in a weirder way.

351
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,500
Fire the cannon.

352
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,080

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:56,090
Maybe it's easier if I only have one to worry about.

355
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,560
Yes!

356
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,580
You could bring them together.

357
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,620
Or it didn't matter.

358
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,780
I didn't need to.

359
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,340
A job well done.

360
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,270
False advertising.

361
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,250

363
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,260
Real advertising.

She's my favorite!

365
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,770

371
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,910
Love Ashley.

372
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:30,410
Wait, okay.

373
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,570
Also, I'm trying to fix myself.

374
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,500
I don't know how to rotate myself down.

375
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,930
How did I fix it before?

376
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,350
What the heck?

377
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:17,690
Sorry.

378
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,210
Hey!

379
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,230
UGH!

380
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:45,590
This only lets me move like this, but this one's supposed to
let me move and turn and stop, and now I can't turn

381
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,320
them.

382
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:23,760
No.

383
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,300
This is...

384
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,080
This is bizarre, I think.

385
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,860
UGH!

386
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,500
UGH!

387
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,180
Okay.

388
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,580
Now let me do this real quick.

389
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Wait!

390
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,460
Why did I disappear again?

391
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:52,620
I give up, I give up, I give up.

392
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,860
I give up.

393
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,000
I give up.

394
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,120
This is how we are.

395
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:56,940
This is how we are.

396
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,160
Go back, I think the angle was right.

397
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,960
I don't think so.

398
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,400
I don't think so.

399
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,640
Okay.

400
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,080
me better.

401
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,360
Thank you for the gift.

402
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,040
Thank you.

403
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:18,920
Nemi.

404
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,100
This maid is too cute.

405
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,020
This nurse is too cute.

406
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,500
Hi, Nemi.

407
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:31,820
Hello.

408
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,660
This game is fun.

409
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,720
I think you would like it.

410
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,400
Actually, I would like to see you play it.

411
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,040
Pocus Pocus.

412
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,840
That's what I want to see.

413
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,860
Caveat Imtor.

414
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,840
Okay, we're gonna play with Ashley.

415
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,080
Yippee!

416
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,700
She's so cute.

417
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:59,090
Don't eat mysterious fruit.

418
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,270
Wario Wario is so good.

419
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:01,790
Yeah!

420
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,630
This one uses your whole body.

421
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,230
It's fun.

422
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,650
Wait, is she gonna eat the fruit and become tiny?

423
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,430
Enormo size.

424
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,950
Enormo size.

425
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,470
Status quo ante.

426
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,850
Make

427
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,110
me me again!

428
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:38,030
That was me doing magical tricks and things.

429
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:41,550
That was me doing magical tricks and things.

430
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:42,970
Spooky!

431
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:45,330
Hey Red, eat this.

432
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,270
It should help.

433
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:46,990
Okay!

434
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,350
Oh, grip.

435
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:52,150
Grip mode.

436
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,390
Alright.

437
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,700
Scales.

438
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,980
The voice from above speaks.

439
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,460
Perform a grip hold with both arms outstretched to the
sides.

440
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,300
Your thumbs must be on top.

441
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,060
On top.

442
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,540
The tilt of your body reflects the imbalance in your heart.

443
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,520
In order to master the scales form, one must empty one's
pockets.

444
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:24,920
Ah!

445
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,340
and lead to disaster.

446
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,480
Dominic.

447
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,420
Fear me.

448
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,520
Scale.

449
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,240
My arms are shining right now.

450
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,120
Lower what's heavier?

451
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,760
I don't know.

452
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:41,400
Nope.

453
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:42,900
Oh, wait.

454
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
How am I supposed to tell?

455
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,340
Tug of war.

456
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,320
Oh, tug, okay.

457
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,560
We're...

458
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,720
The voice from above speaks.

459
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,980
My hands are still very cross.

460
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,720
I'm sorry, guys.

461
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,480
I don't know why.

462
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:08,640
of your navel your dominant hand must be in front my
dominant hand must be one two three pull the voice taught

463
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:16,140
that everyone must pull their weight failure to do so would
be over the line their waist

464
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:21,950
tug of war

465
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:33,060
whoa that was cute Scales.

466
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,680
Grab and pull.

467
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,900
Figures.

468
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:39,520
What?

469
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
I did it though!

470
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,820
I did it!

471
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,360
I did it!

472
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,180
I thought I would be able to...

473
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,840
Scales.

474
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,360
Choose wisely.

475
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,620
No!

476
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,460
I thought I would be able to...

477
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,780
Oh no, we're not gonna make it, you guys!

478
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,760
We're not gonna make it!

479
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,560
I thought that I would be able to...

480
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,060
The star.

481
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,140
The star.

482
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,020
Too bad.

483
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:12,680
Ah!

484
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,360
I thought...

485
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,840
Okay, one more time, one more time, one more time.

486
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,420
Redo!

487
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,200
Second chance, stand.

488
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,560
Do the sacred pose.

489
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,560
Try again.

490
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,760
Try again.

491
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,620
Okay, okay, okay.

492
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,560
Tug of war.

493
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,460
Celebrate the star.

494
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:45,760
Ha!

495
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,300

496
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:46,880

497
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,260

499
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,600
What do you want me to do?

500
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,440
Soak up light.

501
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,350
Bravo.

502
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:00,350
Tug of war.

503
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:00,990
Tug of war.

504
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,910
Tug of war.

505
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,330

00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:07,790
Tug of war.

Cute.

508
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,410
I was trying to pull it.

509
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:10,230
Scales.

510
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,570
Decorate.

511
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,860
Tug of war.

512
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,620
Make it safe.

513
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,440
Oh, oh, oh.

514
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:28,940

Oh.

519
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,520

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,380
Pierce.

521
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:45,540

00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,100
Moving!

573
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,100
What are you doing to me?

574
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,880
What's that face for, Ashley?

575
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,180
Oh my goodness, that one was tough.

576
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,670
Well, the communication with sensors is unstable.

577
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:33,820
Sorry I have to reset like every time.

578
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
380v2 is too cute, I think I'm losing my mind.

579
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,150
This one.

580
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:08,430
Oh my gosh, my arms really are tired, though.

581
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,150
Massage and the big cheese.

582
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,090
Wait, I'm excited for that one.

583
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,430
A curious case of cave art.

584
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:21,990
I know.

585
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,150
Says here, these were drawn by a real caveman.

586
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,230
Big cheese.

587
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,010
Who's that?

588
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:35,630
Yes, I've got it.

589
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:37,910
Behold my latest invention!

590
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,010
The time obliterator 5.0!

591
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,290
Obliterator?

592
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,990
We'll use it to observe the creation of this masterpiece.

593
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,440
It worked!

594
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,820
You're a bad dream!

595
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,640
Oh, wait, it's just the same thing!

596
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,600
It's just so mad.

597
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:03,940
It's just so mad.

598
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,720
If only there was something new I could draw.

599
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,460
Denison Ride is back, baby.

600
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,020
Oh my god.

601
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,060
Why is he doing that?

602
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,060
You've created a time paradox.

603
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,160
Okay, I'm in grip mode.

604
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm gripping.

605
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:34,600
Shall we begin?

606
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,760
Massage.

607
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,000
Massage!

608
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,520
The voice from above speaks.

609
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,540
Perform a grip hold with both hands held straight out in
front of you.

610
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,600
Your palms should be facing down.

611
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,920
The voice used this form to care for those who built its
temple.

612
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,640
The worker's exhaustion was magically lifted.

613
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,640
As a result, the voice could work them even harder.

614
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,220
And the job was done in three days.

615
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:35,670
massage empty why is he living in there big cheese big
cheese the voice from above speaks perform a grip hold with

616
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:41,510
the palms of your hands to your hips thumbs forward then
puff out your chest

617
00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:48,230
This was a form initially reserved for royals.

618
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,250
One day, a king did the big cheese in public.

619
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,750
It spread quickly amongst the people.

620
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,190
And as such, they're all a little cheesy.

621
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:58,730
Yes.

622
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:00,150
Wait.

623
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:01,290
Like now.

624
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:03,890
Big cheese.

625
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:05,350
Big cheese.

626
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:05,610
Jump.

627
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:09,270
Ah!

628
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,750
Looks super.

629
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:13,650
Massage.

630
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,170
Massage.

631
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:15,550
Get.

632
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,010
Yippee!

633
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:21,710
Okay.

634
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:23,650
Cheese.

635
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:26,510
Return curtsies.

636
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:35,660
Why she looks so dubious, though, about it.

637
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,580
These ones are easier.

638
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:37,640
Oh.

639
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:38,660
Trust Tether Sign.

640
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:39,700
Trust Tether Sign?

641
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,080
When this glyph appears, be ready to drop your form stuff.

642
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,320
Wait, I don't have it on!

643
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,840
I don't have mine on it!

644
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:47,640
Strap!

645
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:48,880
Uh-oh.

646
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,380
Who ever has their switch on a strap?

647
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:55,200
Oh no.

648
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,820
If the voice has not revealed one, then never drop your form
stone.

649
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,740
I'll just dangle it a little bit.

650
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,540
Massage.

651
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,940
I dropped it!

652
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:14,670
I dropped it!

653
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,130
I dropped it!

654
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:19,530
Time to hustle!

655
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:20,930
Speed up.

656
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:23,270
Big cheese.

657
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,290
Bump.

658
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,520
Every streamer runs into this problem, I believe it.

659
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:35,880
Twist.

660
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:41,660
Nice.

661
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:43,780
Big cheese.

662
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,660
Hand out.

663
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:48,500
Oops.

664
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,960
It was so fast.

665
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:54,260
Flip.

666
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:55,840
Ugh.

667
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,340
Skeddy.

668
00:45:58,440 --> 00:45:58,700
Squid.

669
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,040
Squid.

670
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:01,820
Big cheese.

671
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:03,480
March.

672
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,240
Oh, what's the big idea, buddy?

673
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:10,000
What's the big idea?

674
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,680
It's okay, we can just get a second chance.

675
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:15,740
Swim.

676
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,620
Oh, geez.

677
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:19,860
Fascinating.

678
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,320
That was crazy.

679
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,300
Big cheese.

680
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:23,580
Dodge.

681
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,140
Massage.

682
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,240
Massage.

683
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:31,540
Pump.

684
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,300
Woohoo!

685
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:39,140
It's quick.

686
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,340
I can't watch.

687
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh no, don't go into the tummy.

688
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,220
Just go down

689
00:46:51,930 --> 00:47:04,670
into...

690
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:09,150
We uh...

691
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:09,310
Oh.

692
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:11,990
Wait, what is that?

693
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:12,950
Oh gosh.

694
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,150
Okay, I have to go down here.

695
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:16,850
What is this?

696
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:17,570
Oh, okay, okay.

697
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,470
All right.

698
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,410
No, no, no, no, no.

699
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,260
Dang it.

700
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:36,640
Okay.

701
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,180
That was so close, though.

702
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,340
That was so close.

703
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,040
One more chance.

704
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,060
Second chance stun!

705
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:50,240
Do the sacred pose.

706
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,000
I am Zen.

707
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,240
Nirvana.

708
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:03,420
A complete recovery.

709
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,260
Big cheese.

710
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:07,640
Big cheese.

711
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,360
Okay, this one is tough, but it's like...

712
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,860
not so bad at the same time.

713
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,180
Pass it out.

714
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,240
Okay, wait, and go!

715
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,380
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:27,220
Alright.

717
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,960
Wish I didn't have to start from the very beginning, though.

718
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,560
Okay, that works.

719
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,080
This works.

720
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,560
And poing!

721
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:40,480
Okay.

722
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:43,280
Oh

723
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,500
my god.

724
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:51,040
Go, go, go!

725
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:16,950
What kind of princess has several stomachs?

726
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:24,140
Wow!

727
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:27,790
Wow!

728
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:31,850
That one's so goofy.

729
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:34,650
Orbulon!

730
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,530
Wait, this one had like three like lifters.

731
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:40,930
Let's try it.

732
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,490
Oh, I forgot to...

733
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:43,670
I don't think I need to reset.

734
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:44,290
I think I'm okay.

735
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,750
Earthfruit is so tasty.

736
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:49,770
I want some fruit.

737
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,900
Thank you, goose!

738
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,160
Where am I?

739
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,200
Who am I?

740
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,660
Oh, so unknown.

741
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:22,220
Awesome.

742
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:23,280
I am a god.

743
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,440
Keep worshiping me.

744
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,280
What did they do to him?

745
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,140
What if Yaluigi had his own Mario spinoff game?

746
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,480
I want that.

747
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:35,100
I was hoping.

748
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,440
I was like, man, if I saw Yaluigi in this game, I'd be so
happy.

749
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:43,380
Wow.

750
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,320
Grip, ungrippin'.

751
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,740
We begin!

752
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,120
Minecraft.

753
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,220
Lifter.

754
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:53,900
Lifter.

755
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:55,820
Ooh.

756
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,860
Your voice from above speaks.

757
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,280
I have to hold it this way, not this way.

758
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,100
Perform a grip hold with both arms held vertically in front
of you.

759
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,560
Your palms should face your head.

760
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,140
Okay.

761
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:11,180
This form catches the strength of a mighty warrior.

762
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:15,020
The voice had intended for the barbells to be a loner.

763
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,340
But they worked so well that it was too intimidated to ask
for them back.

764
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,420
Lift her.

765
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,200
Lift her.

766
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,360
Oh, okay.

767
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:34,160
That was easy.

768
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,200
I don't feel like I did anything, but...

769
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,440
Gift giver.

770
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,240
Gift giver.

771
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:40,800
Like this?

772
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,520
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

773
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,920
The voice from above speaks.

774
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,060
Open both hands.

775
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,020
Then place your form stones in them.

776
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,200
Place my form.

777
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,680
We are?

778
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,980
The rocks are cute in the hand like small pets.

779
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:01,540
But remember this, you too are like a small pet to the
voice.

780
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:02,760
I'm a small pet.

781
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:08,420
Gift giver.

782
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,240
Melt.

783
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,190
I'm confused.

784
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:19,290
Wait, I'm confused.

785
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:20,950
What was I supposed to do there?

786
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:22,250
Baka.

787
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,510
Voice from above speaks.

788
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:32,190
Perform a grip hold with your dominant hand at your nose and
the other at your rear.

789
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:38,150
Your thumbs must be at your nose and rear with the form
stones parallel to the ground.

790
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,130
Feathers looking slink and wind blowing back my comb.

791
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,850
Clucking around the island because that's all I've ever
known.

792
00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:53,190
I'm clucking around the island.

793
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:55,310
This one's uncomfortable.

794
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:59,550
This one's extremely uncomfortable.

795
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,030
Face the wind.

796
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,250
Face the wind.

797
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,180
Gift giver.

798
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:18,480
No!

799
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:19,580
I

800
00:53:24,310 --> 00:53:29,450
just dropped it on the ground.

801
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:30,970
Gift giver.

802
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:32,430
Get candy.

803
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,150
That's not candy.

804
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:34,850
That's candy.

805
00:53:35,110 --> 00:53:35,570
That's candy.

806
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:36,350
Yeah.

807
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,310
That ain't candy.

808
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:38,830
Candy.

809
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,450
Lift her.

810
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,730
Eat the food.

811
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,310
Oh, no!

812
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:46,770
That is too bad.

813
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,090
Why am I getting food thrown into my mouth?

814
00:53:50,290 --> 00:53:50,670
Pack.

815
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:55,580
Cause it.

816
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,080
Gift giver.

817
00:53:58,340 --> 00:53:58,700
Gift giver.

818
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,440
Measure out.

819
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:01,860
Uh.

820
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,340
One chance remains.

821
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:06,420
Oh.

822
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:06,860
Oh.

823
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:08,360
Baka.

824
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,320
Baka.

825
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,420
Like a chance.

826
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:26,700
Do the sacred pose.

827
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,980
What is this?

828
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,020
Let us continue.

829
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,130
Look out.

830
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:52,390
It's impossible.

831
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:53,210
What is this?

832
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:55,870
Lift her.

833
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,050
Break the chains.

834
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:00,330
Ah!

835
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:04,110
Gift giver.

836
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:05,830
Steady.

837
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,350
I threw my Joy-Con.

838
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:18,230
I threw my Joy-Con on accident.

839
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:22,890
It's okay.

840
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:23,910
It's okay.

841
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:31,480
Play a card.

842
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:33,180
Two.

843
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,240
Three.

844
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:48,490
Two!

845
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:51,350
Three!

846
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:58,170
I guess the other one doesn't matter.

847
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,890
Play the pose.

848
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:02,050
Play the pose.

849
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,910
Oh, oh.

850
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:05,930
Oh, this one.

851
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:06,910
There we go.

852
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:07,530
Oh, okay.

853
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,410
I don't do it myself.

854
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,170
Okay, just kidding.

855
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:10,870
Okay, okay.

856
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:20,360
Nice.

857
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,720
Reminds me of Ringfoot.

858
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,080
Ah, it does, right?

859
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,640
Put him up.

860
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,790
Put him up, put him...

861
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,130
The way they're clapping.

862
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:48,910
It's like a guy who sucks.

863
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,730
Somehow we lived.

864
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:57,030
Somehow we made it.

865
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,380
Somehow Minky survived.

866
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:20,500

867
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,080

Huh?

872
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:29,480

956
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:42,770
Look at the treasure!

957
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:47,590
Okay!

958
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:50,270
A job well done.

959
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:54,410
I'm gonna be dizzy.

960
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:17,130
One second, guys.

961
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,050
Let me twist around.

962
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:20,150
Let

963
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,840
me also reset.

964
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:42,590
Here we go.

965
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:44,110
Oh wow, I was all twisted.

966
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:47,470
I was all twisted.

967
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,440
Okay, let's do a few more.

968
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:01,740
Are you guys enjoying the show?

969
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,320
Are you guys enjoying the show?

970
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:06,560
My.

971
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:12,180
Yes!

972
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:14,100
Excellent show.

973
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,340
But the sleeves, you look like a mantis.

974
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:18,720
No!

975
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,120
I'm a ghost!

976
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,080
Oh!

977
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,420
Uh-oh.

978
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,420
One moment, please.

979
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,920
The thigh ones never stay on.

980
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:38,180
I need- I need, like, a garter.

981
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:39,900
For them.

982
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:44,720
Yeah, but the sleeves, I look like a ghost.

983
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,780
Please, um, understand.

984
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:48,880
I look like a ghost.

985
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:54,270
Yeah.

986
01:05:55,510 --> 01:06:01,490
My hands are just like this because I'm very spooky and
scary.

987
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,840
Oh, what did I just press?

988
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,320
I don't know.

989
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,140
Crickets!

990
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:07,700
Oh wait!

991
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,540
Ah, Mantis!

992
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:11,160
Cat!

993
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:11,440
Oh!

994
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:20,880
I remember this game, or not this game, but these two in
particular because I played a previous Wario where where you

995
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:30,740
could dub the you could dub the lines and it was very funny
me no cute though and I thank you for the

996
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:44,590
deep lore is it I

997
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:58,000
don't remember when I played it anyway um Jimmy Terry let's
do let's do here we go battle on flash freeze cape

998
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:24,180
remote flying was assigned to use the strap I don't I don't
even know where my scraps are, though.

999
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,280
I couldn't tell you where they are even.

1000
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,200
How do you even attach it?

1001
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,140
Where do you attach it to?

1002
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,300
Where did the snow come from?

1003
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:55,630
On a plastic piece, the bottom.

1004
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:58,230
You're pretty quick on your feet to have dodged that.

1005
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,570
It's into the radar.

1006
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:04,410
Oh.

1007
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:06,090
Whoa.

1008
01:08:07,210 --> 01:08:07,370
Yeah.

1009
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:12,730
It's fine.

1010
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:13,350
We're fine.

1011
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:14,930
It was just a one-time accident.

1012
01:08:17,410 --> 01:08:18,090
Squat.

1013
01:08:18,490 --> 01:08:18,990
Squat!

1014
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,730
The voice from above speaks.

1015
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:27,230
Perform a grip hold with your palms at your thighs.

1016
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:30,270
Spread your legs and lower your hips.

1017
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,510
Keep your hands on your thighs without letting go.

1018
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:34,590
This is painful.

1019
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:43,190
When the voice was angered, it held this form for threefold
things.

1020
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:47,490
In doing so, the voice's wrath subsided.

1021
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:52,790
What was left behind is the origin of the phrase, mountain
pass.

1022
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:53,650
I have to have my head.

1023
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:00,130
Squat.

1024
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:02,310
Come on.

1025
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:05,690
Okay.

1026
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:11,860
Don't tell me to do it twice though.

1027
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:12,780
Crocodile.

1028
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:13,820
Crocodile.

1029
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,800
Is it like a...

1030
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,160
The voice from a...

1031
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:28,080
above speaks perform a grip hold with palms together and
arms held straight out your dominant hand should be on top

1032
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:39,440
your hands should rest lightly atop each other we do this
out of solidarity with the items which have unusually weak

1033
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:51,750
jaws crocodile unroll unroll look Ah!

1034
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:53,190
Behold!

1035
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:55,770
Look, Gander.

1036
01:09:56,210 --> 01:09:56,490
Squats.

1037
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,830
Aw, eh.

1038
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:06,430
Crocodile.

1039
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:08,690
Eat too.

1040
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:13,990
Cute!

1041
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,760
Why was I drawing with my booty?

1042
01:10:20,020 --> 01:10:20,440
Copy.

1043
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,580
I'm doing it!

1044
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:24,920
Yes!

1045
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:27,100
It hurts!

1046
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,720
Don't fall behind!

1047
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:33,390
Squeeze!

1048
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,440
Oh, sorry!

1049
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,140
Don't lose!

1050
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:52,740
Okay, don't lose!

1051
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,660
Oh, shoot,

1052
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:01,840
shoot, shoot.

1053
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,100
Okay, this ones are kind of hard, you guys.

1054
01:11:05,340 --> 01:11:05,400
Okay, this ones are kind of hard, you guys.

1055
01:11:09,410 --> 01:11:10,910
Oh, okay.

1056
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,530
Do the sacred pose.

1057
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,040
Okay, it is pretty speedy, right?

1058
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,460
Okay, we got this though.

1059
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:33,160
Crocodile.

1060
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:34,800
Crocodile.

1061
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:37,900
Yeah!

1062
01:11:43,870 --> 01:11:44,790
Squat.

1063
01:11:45,670 --> 01:11:46,490
Stomp.

1064
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:53,520
Dumb.

1065
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:54,120
Dumb.

1066
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:54,740
Evaluate.

1067
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,240
Dumb.

1068
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:00,240
That wasn't it?

1069
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:00,840
Squat.

1070
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:02,780
Get dressed.

1071
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:05,460
I got dressed.

1072
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,020
You're on fire!

1073
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,800
Crocodile!

1074
01:12:09,960 --> 01:12:10,900
Press the flower.

1075
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:12,740
Please!

1076
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,800
Open!

1077
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:17,040
I had my arms open!

1078
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:18,440
Avoid.

1079
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:20,840
Oh!

1080
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,000
Your next move is crucial!

1081
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:26,140
Where's the boss stage everybody?

1082
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,400
I don't think I'm doing so well.

1083
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:29,740
Crocodile.

1084
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,180
Okay.

1085
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,130
Cut out the gold.

1086
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:58,740
Clear a path.

1087
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:07,440
Is that good enough?

1088
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:11,440
Stay with it.

1089
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,020
Great job!

1090
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:13,820
Easy!

1091
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,700
Wow, I made it somehow.

1092
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,580
I'm impressed.

1093
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:23,680
Yeah.

1094
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:29,420
Yeah.

1095
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,840
Just like a fellow disciple should.

1096
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:35,840
It's not the voice I expected to come out of Dream.

1097
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,380
Till next time.

1098
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:42,360
Who was that?

1099
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:44,120
Who was that?

1100
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:48,220
Who was that?

1101
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:52,920
No.

1102
01:14:01,870 --> 01:14:02,750
We moved me too.

1103
01:14:02,850 --> 01:14:04,110
Could I get a funny dance for my birthday?

1104
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:04,650
Dread!

1105
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:05,630
Happy birthday!

1106
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,990
What's a funny dance?

1107
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:17,780
Oh, oopsie.

1108
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:19,740
Happy birthday!

1109
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:20,820
Also, sorry, fire!

1110
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:23,940
I missed you earlier too.

1111
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,820
I have so many birthdays today!

1112
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:31,660
Thank you for streaming, Mario, where it's awesome to see
you having fun moving and grooming on my birthday!

1113
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:33,280
Happy birthday, fire!

1114
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,060
Happy birthday to all!

1115
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,100
Oh, my arms are starting to get tired though.

1116
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,320
I missed some.

1117
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:48,480
Some dude, thank you!

1118
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,320
Ducky, thank you!

1119
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,080
You saw Ariel last night.

1120
01:14:56,020 --> 01:15:01,100
Wait, you saw Ariel 6-7 on the entire auditorium.

1121
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,740
Felt like you needed to know that.

1122
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:04,940
Cute, Minto 3D.

1123
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:08,140
If you see this, can you give us the classic Minto twirl?

1124
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,400
Now I'm feeling really upset that she did that to you.

1125
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:17,160
I'm not gonna do it for you guys, but I will do a Minto.

1126
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:17,960
Okay.

1127
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:20,620
Twirl!

1128
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:25,200
Minto Twirl.

1129
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:36,520
Thank you guys!

1130
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,240
Thank you!

1131
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,580
Thank you, thank you!

1132
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:39,920
Thank you so much, brother.

1133
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:40,860
Don't know where it is.

1134
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:43,040
You missed it.

1135
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:46,700
Well, there's this really cool thing called the VOD.

1136
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,600
That maybe you should check out.

1137
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,780
Nah, I'm just kidding.

1138
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,540
I'll do it then.

1139
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,480
Mona cute, Ashley cute, but Minto super cute!

1179
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:01,740

01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,000
Wait, hold on.

1187
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:36,420
I have to take out the sword first.

1188
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:37,080
Fashionista.

1189
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:37,700

1190
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:38,500

1191
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:40,380

1192
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:45,340
I still have to take out the sword.

1193
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:46,560

1194
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:47,940
Roll.

1195
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,360

01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:53,420
Oh!

1197
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:54,640
Fashionista.

1198
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:56,620
Find the cat.

1199
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,380
What?

1200
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:02,540
Add attention.

1201
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,000
Hell.

1202
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,940
I think we didn't win a single one of those guys.

1203
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:16,340
Uh oh.

1204
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:17,440
And I'm lagging.

1205
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,740
Do the sacred pose.

1206
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,860
Violent steps.

1207
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:29,520
We get them next time?

1208
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:30,020
Yeah!

1209
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:31,580
We get them next time!

1210
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,900
Ninja Revive!

1211
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,100
Okay, we got this.

1212
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:36,700
Uh, I gotta get the taxi.

1213
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:37,640
Add attention.

1214
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,100
Damn.

1215
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,040
Taxi!

1216
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,240
What are you thinking?

1217
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:45,660
Hand model.

1218
01:22:45,880 --> 01:22:46,420
Hand model.

1219
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:47,480
Leave to.

1220
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:52,040
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

1221
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:53,640
Wait, this is so cool, actually.

1222
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,400
I love when you get to use, like, the little AR light on the
Joy-Con.

1223
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:58,540
I think it's so fun.

1224
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:00,080
Dress them.

1225
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,440
Dress them.

1226
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,270
Add attention.

1227
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,410
You had on a helmet, so...

1228
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:29,820
What?!

1229
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:33,380
I'm so confused.

1230
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:36,040
Pulled it out before?

1231
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,080
Okay.

1232
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,260
Oh, shirt!

1233
01:23:54,090 --> 01:23:55,090
The shirt!

1234
01:24:21,810 --> 01:24:22,530
Okay.

1235
01:24:27,790 --> 01:24:28,810
The parfait.

1236
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:30,930
I forgot that was our end goal.

1237
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,690
One cares away parfait.

1238
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:39,240
Time for sweets.

1239
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:46,900
Okay.

1240
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:47,860
Jimmy T.

1241
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:48,680
Let's dance.

1242
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,020
Surfing surprise.

1243
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,160
Surfing.

1244
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,500
Surfing surprise!

1245
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:55,800
Surfing!

1246
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:58,200
Surfing surprise!

1247
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:04,950
Even fictional twins sink?

1248
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,250
I mean that's like the thing about twins is they're always
sinking.

1249
01:25:09,290 --> 01:25:09,410
Ooh!

1250
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:11,350
Oh

1251
01:25:31,150 --> 01:25:33,070
my god she's cute!

1252
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:33,530
Wait!

1253
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:35,390
Her?

1254
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:37,190
What am I covering?

1255
01:25:38,530 --> 01:25:39,910
She's so cute!

1256
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:43,350
Let's do it!

1257
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:47,870
Sorry, I didn't mean to cover her.

1258
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:52,030
What is this?

1259
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:56,810
Place the form stones on a flat surface.

1260
01:25:57,530 --> 01:25:58,890
You don't need to crouch.

1261
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:00,550
The front side should...

1262
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:01,590
Okay, I don't need to crouch.

1263
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,790
Do not remove the straps.

1264
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:07,390
See the form stones.

1265
01:26:07,410 --> 01:26:08,050
I put them on my chair.

1266
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:10,090
Respirate from human hands.

1267
01:26:11,450 --> 01:26:16,930
Little do they know that the silent calm is about to be
broken by the people's revels.

1268
01:26:20,490 --> 01:26:21,490
You should crouch.

1269
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,270
Pounce.

1270
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:25,650
Look closely.

1271
01:26:27,230 --> 01:26:28,190
What do I do?

1272
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,890
Which one?

1273
01:26:31,150 --> 01:26:32,710
Oh, this one.

1274
01:26:33,750 --> 01:26:35,270
Wait, isn't that the legend?

1275
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,870
Isn't that the legend?

1276
01:26:39,210 --> 01:26:39,930
Love struck.

1277
01:26:40,330 --> 01:26:41,130
Love struck.

1278
01:26:42,130 --> 01:26:42,970
Love struck.

1279
01:26:44,770 --> 01:26:54,130
Beaks perform a grip hold with your palms with your palms
pull in your arms with thumbs facing upwards Keep your hands

1280
01:26:54,130 --> 01:26:56,730
at your cheeks and don't let them slip

1281
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:09,530
The voice fell deeply in love resulting in the dawn of this
like this It turned out to be more of a short-lived crush,

1282
01:27:09,710 --> 01:27:15,470
but the name stuck kind of goofy That was his love struck.

1283
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:18,090
Love struck.

1284
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,050
Gaze.

1285
01:27:20,850 --> 01:27:21,490
No.

1286
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,220
So bang.

1287
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,740
That went so good.

1288
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:30,400
Archer.

1289
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,580
Archer.

1290
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,260
The voice from above speaks.

1291
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,680
Perform a grip hold with your dominant hand's palm on your
chest.

1292
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,420
Hold the other arm straight out.

1293
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:45,400
Turn your chest to the center.

1294
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:47,820
as if you're drawing a bowstring.

1295
01:27:50,820 --> 01:27:51,640
I am...

1296
01:27:51,640 --> 01:27:53,740
Father, the hunt went so well today.

1297
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:58,620
Yes, it's lucky for us that we've practiced the Archer form.

1298
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:06,660
Parent and child return to their home as the skies above
practiced sunset form.

1299
01:28:08,260 --> 01:28:10,140
I am the bone of my sword.

1300
01:28:12,520 --> 01:28:13,180
Archer.

1301
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,260
Sink.

1302
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,420
Look

1303
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,740
closely.

1304
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:30,520
Flip this card.

1305
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,440
Yes!

1306
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,220
Archer.

1307
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:39,300
Serve.

1308
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:41,260
Easy.

1309
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:46,740
These ones aren't so bad.

1310
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,260
I say until it speeds up.

1311
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:52,720
Catch the bird.

1312
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:56,220
Aha!

1313
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:00,780
Sword.

1314
01:29:01,780 --> 01:29:02,400
Sword?

1315
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:04,780
What?

1316
01:29:05,660 --> 01:29:07,440
Wait, I got- I did that one!

1317
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,960
It's my best one.

1318
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:13,640
I guess my best one.

1319
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:13,900
I like it.

1320
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:14,320
Yay!

1321
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:16,160
Archer.

1322
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,850
My lordy.

01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,960
Look at that.

1438
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:48,860

Play it.

1448
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,800
Play it.

1449
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:18,820
Stop in the zone.

1450
01:38:21,400 --> 01:38:21,520
Oh.

1451
01:38:21,820 --> 01:38:23,960

1452
01:38:24,260 --> 01:38:24,400
Oh.

1453
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:27,000
Take your child's hand.

1454
01:38:33,690 --> 01:38:35,490
I like how they're like, this one's your child.

1455
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:35,710
I like how they're like, this one's your child.

1456
01:38:35,770 --> 01:38:37,470
Where was this child?

1457
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:46,630
Take the child!

1458
01:38:48,170 --> 01:38:48,970
Take a child!

1459
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:51,870
Easy.

1460
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,400
Suck it up.

1461
01:38:59,760 --> 01:39:01,080
Come on!

1462
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,680
You got this kid?

1463
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,620
She can't suck!

1464
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,320
Massage.

1465
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:09,220
Shoot!

1466
01:39:11,110 --> 01:39:11,740

01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:15,820

1468
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,240
doing it.

1469
01:39:27,250 --> 01:39:27,980
I'm doing it.

1470
01:39:33,910 --> 01:39:34,410

01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:37,010

Ow!

1473
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:49,940
It might be a flying toilet.

1474
01:39:50,160 --> 01:39:51,680
It might be a toilet robot.

1475
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:54,220
It might be a skibbity robot.

1476
01:39:55,020 --> 01:39:56,180
It might be...

1477
01:39:56,180 --> 01:39:59,040
It might be...

1478
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:02,640
It might be.

1479
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:18,010
Oh, I think they're gonna make it.

1480
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:22,690

1482
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:26,510
I knew this hippo was gonna win.

01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,910
Everybody else went the wrong way!

1484
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:34,610
Any minute now, I can smell that finish line.

1485
01:40:41,050 --> 01:40:42,670

1486
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,400

1507
01:41:55,190 --> 01:41:56,890
Do, do, do, do, do.

1508
01:42:06,160 --> 01:42:08,260
We didn't get a single one.

1509
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,620
There's so many of you haven't gotten.

1510
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:17,720
I think though I'm gonna call it here.

1511
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:22,480
The head strap is starting to give me a slight headache, so
I hope you guys don't mind.

1512
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:26,720
I know we didn't get super, super far into the game, but...

1513
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,860
I still had a lot of fun.

1514
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:31,240
volcano at least, but...

1515
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:35,700
But thank you guys for...

1516
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:37,720
for the blur you were.

1517
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:39,120
I had a lot of fun.

1518
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,480
I hope you guys did too.

1519
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,580
Wait, before we go.

1520
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,240
It's worth waking up for him to get to the stream.

1521
01:42:58,380 --> 01:42:59,440
Thank you, Wiggletuber!

1522
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:00,800
Thank you!

1523
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:01,440
Oh my gosh.

1524
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:02,940
Cool to sleep, David.

1525
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:06,380
Thank you for a fun 3D stream on this very cool day.

1526
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:06,800
I know!

1527
01:43:06,940 --> 01:43:09,400
I just want to put on my Oh my jacket, I'm so cold!

1528
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:12,580
Boobius, thank you!

1529
01:43:14,020 --> 01:43:15,840
Thank you, thank you!

1530
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,020
I can't see it, so thank you!

1531
01:43:36,190 --> 01:43:36,710
Um...

1532
01:43:36,710 --> 01:43:37,530
We're in the void.

1533
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:40,790
We're voiding, we're in the void.

1534
01:43:41,770 --> 01:43:43,190
We're in the void now!

1535
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:45,450
Um...

1536
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:48,810
Wait, where did I go?

1537
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:49,470
No.

1538
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,040
Thank you guys.

1539
01:43:59,260 --> 01:43:59,720
Thank you.

1540
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:00,860
Thank you.

1541
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:08,180
Thank you for the ultra cute stream today.

1542
01:44:08,540 --> 01:44:09,080
Thank you.

1543
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,080
Can we get 3D?

1544
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:12,260
MINTO?

1545
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:12,780
No.

1546
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:14,740
No.

1547
01:44:15,460 --> 01:44:15,860
No.

1548
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:16,820
No.

1549
01:44:16,820 --> 01:44:17,340
No.

1550
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:18,080
No.

1551
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:18,700
No.

1552
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:19,100
No.

1553
01:44:19,100 --> 01:44:19,200
No.

1554
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:21,100
No.

1555
01:44:23,420 --> 01:44:24,080
No.

1556
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:26,880
No.

1557
01:44:27,140 --> 01:44:27,380
No.

1558
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:40,950
No, thank you.

1559
01:44:44,380 --> 01:44:45,000
Rikitanku!

1560
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,140
Wait, I want to do...

1561
01:44:46,140 --> 01:44:46,680
Hold on.

1562
01:44:50,120 --> 01:44:51,040
There we go.

1563
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:51,420
Okay.

1564
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:56,660
Well, folks, we had a grand old time today.

1565
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:59,120
But it's time to say goodbye.

1566
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:03,720
And I will see you in the next one.

1567
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:05,660
That's all, folks.
