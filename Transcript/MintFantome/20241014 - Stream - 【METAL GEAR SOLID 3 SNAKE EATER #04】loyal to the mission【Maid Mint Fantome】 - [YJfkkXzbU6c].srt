1
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,620
Welcome back, master!

2
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:40,740
My lord!

3
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,540
Hello!

4
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,790
Hello, hello, hello.

5
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,290
Kept us waiting, huh?

6
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,050
I'm sorry!

7
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,950
I'm sorry!

8
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm so sorry!

9
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,580
I just ran to go get some...

10
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,820
Because my hot water was boiling.

11
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,160
I was like, maybe I can get some hot water before stream.

12
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,020
So, how are you feeling, Mito?

13
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,080
I'm... I'm okay.

14
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,060
I'm a little sleepy.

15
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,160
I'm on about...

16
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,200
One hour of sleep and then two hours of sleep.

17
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:25,980
So...

18
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,300
Hold on, I don't want to listen to Snake Eater just yet.

19
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,980
Said no one ever!

20
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,820
Just kidding, but I do want to talk a little bit until we listen to it.

21
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,100
No!

22
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,360
Wait!

23
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:37,840
No!

24
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,420
Okay, there we go.

25
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,600
You're looking mintier than usual.

26
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,080
Is it my hair?

27
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,820
Why so little sleep?

28
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,160
Oh, well...

29
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,840
Because I...

30
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,640
Had an event today.

31
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,380
Vmuse in Malaysia.

32
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,260
And...

33
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,600
GMT plus 8, I think it is.

34
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,620
It's like literally opposite of me.

35
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,620
So, I had a meet and greet at...

36
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,560
Their time, 3.45pm.

37
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,340
But for me, it was 3.45am.

38
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,140
And...

39
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,820
During... Before... When I had to like wake up or stuff like that, I don't sleep the night before.

40
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,460
But my insomnia has been kind of bad recently anyway.

41
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,280
So...

42
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,060
I fell asleep around 2 and then I woke up at 3.

43
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,760
Oh boy, 3am!

44
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,760
And then after the meet and greet, I was really excited...

45
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,340
For meeting everybody.

46
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,140
That I couldn't fall asleep again.

47
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,760
Even though I didn't have to be up until...

48
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,260
6.30am.

49
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,760
So, I fell asleep at...

50
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,760
Like 5.30am.

51
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,140
And...

52
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,740
But I'm okay!

53
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,380
I'm alright.

54
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,220
I'm feeling okay.

55
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Hopefully, I've slept...

56
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,600
I don't know, I slept a little bit.

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Oh wait, so actually I slept also after the concert.

58
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,060
For about 2 hours.

59
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,020
So...

60
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,300
Isn't that like a thing though?

61
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,260
That people do?

62
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,280
Like an intermittent sleeping or something?

63
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,360
It's just me trying that out.

64
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,140
Micronaps.

65
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,480
Power nap gaming.

66
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,360
Some nap maxing.

67
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:27,940
I don't...

68
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,800
That's... Yeah, that's the scientific term.

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

70
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,180
Nap maxing.

71
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,320
Yeah, but they tend to be crazy.

72
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, why is it blocked off?

73
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:43,780
There we go.

74
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,780
Thank you, Roden!

75
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,280
Love job early in the morning.

76
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,640
No!

77
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,180
Good luck with job tomorrow!

78
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,740
How would you feel knowing how many people you inspired to become Vtubers?

79
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,960
I mean...

80
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,420
I sell this to lots of people who are always just like...

81
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,480
You inspired me to do this or you inspired me to do this.

82
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,460
And I'm like... I mean...

83
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:13,700
But...

84
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,560
But ultimately... Sorry, I know I should probably...

85
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,660
I want to listen to Snake Eater.

86
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,140
I don't want to just go to the menu yet.

87
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,060
But ultimately, like...

88
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,960
It's up to... It's you who takes the first step, so...

89
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,820
You know, I don't feel like I really do anything.

90
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,400
So...

91
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,860
I'm just here playing Metal Gear Solid.

92
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,120
That's what I like to do.

93
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,540
You know it's serious when I'm drinking Energy Gamer Subs?

94
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,500
Hashtag...

95
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,480
Code Boomer for...

96
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,820
For a discount off your Gamer Subs order.

97
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,420
Code Boomer!

98
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,140
Code Boomer!

99
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,580
But I figured that maybe the tea wasn't enough.

100
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,160
So...

101
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,700
What flavor?

102
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,940
I like to mix the...

103
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,880
Non-caffeinated version of lemonade and then...

104
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,140
Another flavor.

105
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,200
Which just turns it into...

106
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,180
Flavor lemonade.

107
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,200
You know?

108
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,340
So...

109
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,580
Oh my gosh.

110
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,080
I got like...

111
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,820
I actually... I did like a...

112
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,500
What's it called?

113
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,940
Like a store-bought lemonade?

114
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,700
And then I mixed it with...

115
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,880
Oh no, it wasn't store-bought.

116
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,200
It was... Well, I mean, it was Wendy's Lemonade.

117
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,360
It was Wendy's Lemonade and I...

118
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,240
Forgot to ask for like a flavored lemonade.

119
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,520
And so I put in a Raspberry Gamer Subs into it.

120
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,860
It was so good.

121
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,960
It was actually so good.

122
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,800
Oh my gosh.

123
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,460
Minto making potions.

124
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,100
I know!

125
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,780
Did you try the Krabby Patty?

126
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,260
No!

127
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,520
Because it's like the most disappointing thing ever!

128
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:06,780
Right?

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,140
I hear everybody going to go get the Krabby Patty.

130
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,800
And...

131
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,780
It's not even a special packaging.

132
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,540
It's not even a special...

133
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,060
Like wrapping or any...

134
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,520
It's just a normal burger!

135
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,800
I feel like they flopped it hard.

136
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,720
Right?

137
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,340
Like...

138
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,520
I feel like they really didn't go...

139
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,200
As hard as they should have.

140
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
Total disappointment.

141
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,460
Yeah!

142
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,880
US sucks for tie-ins like this.

143
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,520
I know!

144
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,380
What a...

145
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,380
The boss equivalent for many VTubers still waiting for my Minto Gamer Subs.

146
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,420
One day I will get to meet and greet...

147
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,020
In the Midwest.

148
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,920
I hope so!

149
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,460
If you want to see me somewhere just to...

150
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,420
Well, right now I'm kind of taking a break from events.

151
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,200
Because I have some big stuff lined up for the end of the year.

152
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,600
But...

153
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,140
If you want to see me at an event...

154
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,180
Just talk to your local convention and say...

155
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,900
Hey, I would like to see Mint Phantom.

156
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,680
Yeah, yeah.

157
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,140
And the end of the month.

158
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,500
Yeah!

159
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,020
I have stuff at the end of the month.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,840
Incidentally, Code Boomer is what they say over the intercom...

161
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,380
When you show up at conventions.

162
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
Shut up!

163
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,220
We got a Code Boomer.

164
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,380
Code Boomer here.

165
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,440
You just had to come out with a new outfit when I got done making the outfit for the Mint Dolphy Dream.

166
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,320
No, no, no!

167
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,280
Keiko, Keiko, Keiko!

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,240
You're okay.

169
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,660
Because my new outfit is basically...

170
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,740
My current outfit.

171
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,820
But with small, small changes.

172
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,240
Just small changes.

173
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,380
So, you should be okay.

174
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,000
You should be okay.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,460
Just a tiny, tiny bit different.

176
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:07,060
I didn't want to make it so different that people didn't recognize me.

177
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,540
Yeah, the same, but different.

178
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,740
Spoilers?

179
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,840
How is it spoilers?

180
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,360
How is it spoilers?

181
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,840
I've been saying this...

182
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,240
Did you guys watch the video?

183
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,520
He literally says...

184
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,080
A whole new outfit.

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,540
A whole new look, but not really.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He literally says that.

187
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:35,820
Oh, for the Vmuse thing, I did want to say...

188
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,060
If anybody got the streaming tickets...

189
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,640
I'm really sorry if there were...

190
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,700
If there were issues.

191
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,980
Yay, thank you.

192
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,560
Of course!

193
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:48,940
But...

194
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,760
If you were at the event, thank you for coming.

195
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,760
I feel really bad about...

196
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,860
Especially if people woke up really early...

197
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,820
To watch or something.

198
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm so sorry.

199
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,780
Hopefully, they can...

200
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,720
Hopefully, they can get the VOD up...

201
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,740
Really soon.

202
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,560
Said they'll release the VOD or something at least.

203
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,760
Yeah, yeah, so...

204
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

205
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:25,680
Mmm...

206
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,160
It was...

207
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,080
It was fun though.

208
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,640
It's 5AM for me, I'm so sorry.

209
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,040
How many loops of CQC theme was it at this point?

210
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,600
I don't know.

211
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,720
I'm trying to like wake up a little bit.

212
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,040
I'm trying to wake up a little bit, which is why I'm talking.

213
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
But, yeah.

214
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,200
Oh my gosh!

215
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,880
You know what?

216
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,380
Okay, yesterday I was supposed to stream this game.

217
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
But I didn't.

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Because I instead...

219
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,820
I instead was like, okay, I'll rest.

220
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,300
Even though I didn't...

221
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,120
I like, couldn't sleep at all.

222
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,580
Maybe Corinnexit5 gets it!

223
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,120
But I also wanted to save my throat a little bit.

224
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,940
But...

225
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,800
My new display cabinet came.

226
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,680
It wasn't supposed to come until like mid next week.

227
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,180
But it came yesterday.

228
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,280
So I was able to put that together.

229
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,880
And put all my Metal Gear stuff in it.

230
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:26,780
And...

231
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,180
Sorry, I dropped my controller.

232
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,000
So...

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,460
Yeah!

234
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,160
It's actually like right behind me.

235
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,740
So I can turn around and look at it and be like...

236
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,640
Not all my Metal Gear stuff fits in it.

237
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,440
Like, I kept the books on the bookshelf.

238
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,340
I...

239
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,720
I'm just gonna press this.

240
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,040
Oh wait!

241
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,720
No!

242
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,200
Wait!

243
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:53,700
Sticky no!

244
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,660
Go back.

245
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:54,980
Wait!

246
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,340
No!

247
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:55,720
No!

248
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,080
No!

249
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:56,760
Back!

250
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,160
Back!

251
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,420
Back!

252
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:57,620
Back!

253
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:57,800
Back!

254
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,020
Okay.

255
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:03,980
But...

256
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,860
How was KLP48?

257
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,040
They were so cute!

258
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,440
They were so...

259
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,020
Oh my gosh, they were so cute!

260
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,680
They were so, so cute.

261
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,420
Books in a display cabinet.

262
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,940
No, no, no!

263
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,040
I kept them on the bookshelf.

264
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,440
Just kind of like...

265
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,220
Display-y stuff is in the display cabinet.

266
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:33,980
Boxcar!

267
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,780
Happy birthday, first of all!

268
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,380
Also, oh my gosh, I'm so jealous!

269
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
That sounds so fun!

270
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,360
Happy birthday to you!

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,460
Should I get a display cabinet for mint merch?

272
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,740
I don't think there is that much.

273
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,060
Okidoki.

274
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,400
Was V-Muser first time performing with an idol group?

275
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,440
Yes, it was!

276
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,320
It actually...

277
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,480
It was like an actual dream come true.

278
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,800
Like, I have a goals list.

279
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,060
And it's actually on there.

280
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Ok!

281
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,700
Snake Eater time!

282
00:15:31,600 --> 00:16:02,200
What a thrill With darkness and silence through the night What a thrill I'm searching and I'm melting to you What a fear in my heart But you're so supreme

283
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,660
I'd give my life, not for honor

284
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:44,420
Snake Eater In my time There'll be no one else I love the falling guys Crime is the way I fly to you I'm still in a dream Snake Eater

285
00:16:47,780 --> 00:17:38,110
Some day, you'll go through the rain And some day, you'll feed on a tree frog This ordeal, the trial, to survive For the day we see new light I give my life, not for honor, but for you In my time, there'll be no one else Crime, it's the way I blight

286
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,800
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater

287
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,200
I like the peace one.

288
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm still in a dream, Snake Eater

289
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,520
Oh, I think I heard a little bit of a Sneater!

290
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,700
Alright, Sneater!

291
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,640

295
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,060

Wait, could they eat this, maybe?

303
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,660
We can throw the Arbat for them to get sick.

00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
A boss gave it to me.

308

542
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,180

543
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,880
Crawl, crawl.

544
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:02,560
Oh my gosh All I see is darkness Is this just a hiding spot?

545
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:11,520
Okay, nevermind Item info tells you how to spin I need to know Wait

546
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:44,520
Aim with... No it doesn't I feel like I'm getting trolled right now Wait, aim with L1 button, play with right analog stick in first person view Aim with... That's what I was doing though Aim with L1 in first person I

547
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,200
needed to not actually be equipping it I should

548
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,300
be doing this.

549
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,200
This is what was throwing it off Okay

550
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,300
I like how they say to play.

551
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,160
It's not like to aim or anything Can I climb up this other side?

552
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,140
I saw a rat.

553
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,560
Oh no, that's not a rat.

554
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:25,700
I saw a frog Looks tasty

555
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,740
Alright, let's keep going.

556
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:37,360
Oh wait, let's get my gun out I'm ready to shoot any dogs.

557
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,740
I hope I don't have to, but you know, just in case

558
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,960
They'll be able to sniff me out They're pretty good

559
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,700
There are rats here Wait, which way should I go?

560
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,860
Oh gosh, this is such a maze.

561
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,820
Imagine getting six headshots like that, spinning the gun between each one Wait, how do I get up here?

562
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,020
Oh no, see it's a maze Oh my gosh, okay.

563
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,060
So we have to go up here

564
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:21,930
I'm ready to kill on sight

565
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,020
I don't think he liked what I...

566
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:39,360
Wait, where am I hearing him?

567
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,740
I see a little rat.

568
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,000
Are you growling at me?

569
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,860
Oh no, it's definitely...

570
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,500
Where am I hearing him growling from?

571
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,000
Behind the bars?

572
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:57,650
Hey, shut up!

573
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,750
Shut up!

574
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:06,390
I won't kill you because you're behind a bar But next time you won't be so lucky, dog

575
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,610
This part is kind of pain.

576
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,430
Oh gosh.

577
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:30,550
Okay, so it says keep heading north If you can spin a new game plus in front of Ocelot during his boss fight, he'll stop shooting and meet you to do buddy spinning going...

578
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:33,550
Okay,

579
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:42,770
just keep going up But it's like a maze, so it's hard to know which way to go

580
00:43:46,900 --> 00:44:00,200
And there's also dogs and people I'm not much of a dog person But I do love animals I don't want to hurt animals

581
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:08,170
What the?

582
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,250

592
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:32,870

593
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,680

No.

716
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:21,890
Oh my gosh, who ran that way?

717
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:30,710
Oh my gosh, that was freaky Guys, I don't think we are keeping it under ten Stay away from me

718
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:35,850
Stay away from me

719
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,680
Do you guys know that 90's Halloween sound?

720
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,980
That they thought ghosts made

721
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:05,060
That's how I feel about this area Fury.

722
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:07,200
Oh my gosh

723
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,710
That's how I feel when the guys go...

724
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:22,270
Oh, is this it?

725
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:23,390
Is this the end of the line?

726
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:27,490
Leave this place How many was that you guys?

727
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:28,210

728
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:29,910
Six plus three?

729
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,230
Wait, who is that?

730
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,920
Oh my gosh, there he is.

731
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:43,000
The sorrow

732
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:57,810
There he is, there he is Oh my gosh, that scared me No way!

733
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:12,410
Ok, we already went through it.

734
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,090
Wait, so...

735
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:14,570
No, I didn't forget.

736
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:20,030
I forgot that I couldn't touch it I didn't forget about it, but...

737
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,750
Wait, so...

738
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:22,990
How many was that?

739
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:26,350
Call over the codec?

740
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,410
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

741
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:28,150
These ones are cool.

742
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,330
I like these codec calls

743
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,770
Snake!

744
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,580
Snake!

745
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:47,940
You forgot the gimmick.

746
00:59:48,020 --> 00:59:48,880
No, I didn't!

747
00:59:49,420 --> 01:00:00,160
I'm telling you, I didn't, you guys I know I have to take the pill, please Why are you guys always acting like I'm forgetting things?

748
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,120
Snake!

749
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:05,500
Snake!

750
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,620
I can take it here though.

751
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,680
Oh, back again?

752
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,860
That's so awesome Yeah, I love it here.

753
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,660
I'm a ghost.

754
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:26,500
This is where I belong, sorrow This is where I belong Oh my God

755
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,020
I didn't know you could... wait, snake get up.

756
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,740
Snake, can you get up?

757
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:44,240
I didn't know they'd start coming at me You can drown in here, that's kind of crazy Ok, it's in my backpack.

758
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,840
Wait, no I still have it here, right?

759
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,360
My fake death pill Wait, why won't it let me use it?

760
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,780
Do I actually have to go all the way to the end?

761
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,800
Ok, we'll just run

762
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:18,560
Use grenades I definitely have those No!

763
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:29,250
Sick, backflip.

764
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:30,450
Oh yeah!

765
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:31,950
Ok, I'm walking.

766
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:38,190
Don't touch me I love zombie Payne

767
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:50,210
I don't know why the Payne's name is the most difficult for me to remember

768
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:59,230
I always want to call him the Fury

769
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,950
When did I kill a helicopter guy?

770
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:09,990
Not a helicopter guy One of the guys in the thingies

771
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,270
Sorrow, so sorrow

772
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,830
Knocked him out and he crashed.

773
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:22,910
That shouldn't count though Oh my god.

774
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,890
Wait, we get to see the fear again.

775
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:32,930
Look at him go Oh my gosh Get it girl

776
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:40,890
Killing shouldn't count as killing.

777
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:42,610
It was an indirect thing.

778
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:46,890
I put him to sleep I put him to sleep, it's not my fault.

779
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:50,550
He fell asleep and couldn't control his wheel and then...

780
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,110
crashed.

781
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,190
It's not my fault

782
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,640
Where's the guy that ran past us?

783
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:01,560
That one was fun

784
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:05,980
Sure.

785
01:03:05,980 --> 01:03:09,260
Indirect murder What's it called?

786
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,510
It's called...

787
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:26,240
Involuntary manslaughter Maybe Why are you panting like that?

788
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:28,500
Either.

789
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:47,170
The bird definitely flew away

790
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,380
I don't think shooting someone...

791
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:09,480
Shooting someone counts as involuntary But it was a, it was a tranq gun Get away from me you freak

792
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,720
I just put him to sleep, it's not my fault he fell asleep No, no, no.

793
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:32,320
He fell asleep but he couldn't control his car He should have measures for that Not sure that will hold up in the court of law I think it will

794
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:44,580
I actually don't mind doing this part because it's just so cool It does hold up in court!

795
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:44,900
Court!

796
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,800
It holds up in court for real!

797
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,190
Can I use my pill?

798
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:56,130
No

799
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:03,110
So what's the order of operations here?

800
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,900
This game always makes me hungry

801
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:30,220
Touch the corpse, take the pill Okidoki My death pill Wait, it's the death pill The

802
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:39,690
death pill.

803
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:41,270
Why can't I use the death pill anyway?

804
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,950
Why can't I use the death pill?

805
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:52,470
But I want to just die and then come back

806
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,300
Why won't it let me use it?

807
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:08,860
Wait, I'm so confused

808
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,290
Why won't it let me use it?

809
01:06:18,550 --> 01:06:28,830
Oh here we go Just kidding, I'm not dead There we go I remember

810
01:06:32,870 --> 01:06:34,730
Yeah, I did forget that part.

811
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:39,870
I remember that I had to take it I just forgot one thing Hahaha

812
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:51,610
No Sorrow

813
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,400
Snake, get up

814
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:31,250
Are you winning son?

815
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:54,830
Back in the jungle In the jungle, the Russian jungle, the snake sleeps tonight

816
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:07,670
Wait, where?

817
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:08,630
Oh there he is.

818
01:08:08,850 --> 01:08:09,670
Bye bye!

819
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:21,560
Snake How do you do the things you do?

820
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:25,280
Yeah it was

821
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:51,580
Up there This is why when...

822
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:58,140
Yeah actually I'll talk about it after After this

823
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:09,580
Talk to me!

824
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,440
What about him and the boss?

825
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:13,320
What was the story between them?

826
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:24,300
Knew what?

827
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,280
The boss?

828
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,760
No

829
01:09:50,820 --> 01:10:10,140
No Nope.

830
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:19,100
Still partners, even in death.

831
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:19,780
Yeah.

832
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,000
I was dead, evil.

833
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,020
Spooky.

834
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,500
It's freaky, alright.

835
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:34,400
Because it involves ghosts.

836
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:42,300
That is the sorrow of being left scared.

837
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,800
This game is made for me.

838
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:56,140
I need my stuff, evil.

839
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:56,560
Like, now.

840
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:00,980
Like, this is the perfect time for my moss.

841
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:02,200
My moss camel.

842
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:06,980
Can you throw me my stuff here?

843
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:11,760
I'm gonna get caught, for sure.

844
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,280
They're gonna see my big burly body.

845
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,840
Why is the caution at 99%?

846
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,040
What the hell?

847
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:29,600
I just got here.

848
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,020
Looking forward to your 3.0 debut.

849
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:33,700
Thank you, crow!

850
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,000
Is this when Eva can talk about your missing food?

851
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:39,560
No, because...

852
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:39,560
Oh

853
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,580
my gosh, snake.

854
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,600
Wait, can I make him throw up?

855
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:00,940
Let's try.

856
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:05,120
If he throws up, maybe he'll expel it.

857
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,000
Yeah, time to puke, baby.

858
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:10,220
You still have the transmitter in your body?

859
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:12,340
Yeah.

860
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:19,100
Puke up now.

861
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:23,560
See?

862
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:31,960
Okay, let's see.

863
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:32,280
Hold on.

864
01:12:33,020 --> 01:12:34,360
I love barfing, snake.

865
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,240
Okay.

866
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,900
Is it because of the transmitter that the...

867
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:45,960
I took it out before, so is it because of the transmitter that I have the caution healer?

868
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,880
I might have to kill people, but now I don't care about my river.

869
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:55,740
Oh, sorry.

870
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,920
I keep going to the wrong thing.

871
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,320
I'm gonna save real quick, though.

872
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:01,920
You wanna save?

873
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,280
Hold on a sec.

874
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:07,060
Yeah, I wanna keep the scene, though.

875
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,240
I love it.

876
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:13,080
Leave it in now, though.

877
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,680
Yeah, if we have to kill some people, whatever.

878
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:16,780
We just have to run past them.

879
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:17,600
It's fine.

880
01:13:20,540 --> 01:13:22,020
Sorry, I gave you the murder pass.

881
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,000
Oh, that's what I wanted to say.

882
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:26,020
Like, after that codec, right?

883
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:30,400
And this is some MGS5 spoilers, so...

884
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,920
Wait, I wasn't done talking!

885
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:35,400
Yeah, which one?

886
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:50,260
I think he was interested in the mother is a teenage whatever.

887
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,650
But, okay, so...

888
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:02,510
Some MGSV spoilers, so sorry guys.

889
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,150
I'll wiggle once I'm done talking about them if you wanna go.

890
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:08,950
Spoilers closing my ears.

891
01:14:09,030 --> 01:14:09,890
Yeah, yeah, close your ears.

892
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:19,990
So, this is why in 5, when they try to explain everything as being like...

893
01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:22,290
The virus?

894
01:14:23,530 --> 01:14:25,170
Like the parasites or whatever?

895
01:14:25,970 --> 01:14:27,550
Oh, it makes me so mad.

896
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:33,990
Because Metal Gear has always been a quote-unquote paranormal supernatural...

897
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:36,070
Not paranormal, but supernatural series.

898
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:36,990
Right?

899
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:40,990
And it's so annoying that only until 5.

900
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:43,170
And that's kind of one of my biggest...

901
01:14:43,170 --> 01:14:48,790
Actually, one of my biggest issues with 5 is that it kind of rewrites this game in that way.

902
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:54,730
It makes me so angry that it makes everything nanomachines and supernatural stuff.

903
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:59,790
Like, even in 4, despite so much being nanomachines...

904
01:15:00,610 --> 01:15:05,710
We still have the sorrow appear again.

905
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:07,970
Slash psychomantic.

906
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:11,070
Like, you know, it's kind of like, it's still supernatural.

907
01:15:11,630 --> 01:15:13,030
There's still supernatural elements.

908
01:15:13,310 --> 01:15:17,090
Despite how quote-unquote scientific they make it...

909
01:15:17,090 --> 01:15:20,950
Like, there are still these elements that make the game mysterious and fun.

910
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:26,210
Like, I didn't need an explanation as to why the fear was like the way he was.

911
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,250
Or why the end could have photosynthesis.

912
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:30,050
I don't care.

913
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,210
I don't care.

914
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:34,770
They're just cool.

915
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,030
They're just a bunch of freaks.

916
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:39,510
I didn't think of that.

917
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,590
That just makes me so...

918
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,330
Just Kojima post MGS4.

919
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:46,030
Everything needed to have a needless explanation.

920
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,310
I know.

921
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:48,330
That's what...

922
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:52,450
That was my biggest gripe with V.

923
01:15:52,690 --> 01:15:54,030
Was that it kind of explained...

924
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:55,330
It just rather...

925
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:59,030
It filled in quote-unquote plot holes that weren't really...

926
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:02,670
That people didn't really care about being plot holes.

927
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:04,170
You know, they weren't actually plot holes.

928
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:09,590
Like, oh, why did you have to fight Big Boss two times in Metal Gear 1 and Metal Gear 2?

929
01:16:10,030 --> 01:16:10,630
Like, I don't...

930
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:11,350
Because...

931
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:13,230
Because he's an 80's action villain.

932
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:13,950
I don't know.

933
01:16:17,330 --> 01:16:17,770
Like...

934
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:20,690
And I never even once thought why...

935
01:16:20,690 --> 01:16:24,570
Why is the Cobra Unit like the way they are?

936
01:16:24,650 --> 01:16:27,030
I just thought that they were like a group of...

937
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,750
Supernatural guys.

938
01:16:29,950 --> 01:16:31,310
I mean, not all of them are supernatural.

939
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,170
Like the Fury, he's just an astronaut.

940
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,670
He's just a guy in suit.

941
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:39,450
Nanomachines and memes.

942
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:40,610
The DNA of the soul.

943
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,370
Am I right, Mint?

944
01:16:41,830 --> 01:16:42,270
Absolutely.

945
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:44,590
I don't know.

946
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:48,210
Playing B-Man with nanomachines or signs.

947
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:49,370
He's just...

948
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,490
He's just a guy with bees.

949
01:16:53,610 --> 01:16:57,270
And no parasites, no nanomachines, nothing.

950
01:16:57,510 --> 01:16:57,950
You know what?

951
01:16:58,290 --> 01:16:59,850
Actually, it's just so great.

952
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:05,150
Ocelot is just genuinely the way that he is because of the way that he is.

953
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:09,770
In this game, he's got no parasites, he's got no nanomachines.

954
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:12,310
He's just the way that he is...

955
01:17:12,310 --> 01:17:13,750
Because he is.

956
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,990
And I love that for him.

957
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,630
Anyway.

958
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:19,050
Okay, spoilers over, spoilers over, spoilers over.

959
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:22,130
I wiggle, I wiggle, I wiggle, I wiggle, I wiggle.

960
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,150
No more spoilers.

961
01:17:25,230 --> 01:17:27,030
Oh, but it really just...

962
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,930
Grinds my gears.

963
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,190
Really grinds my gears, guys.

964
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:33,850
Uh, okay.

965
01:17:38,860 --> 01:17:40,160
How do I get up here again?

966
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:44,210
Is there a tree?

967
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:47,910
I love this music though.

968
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,790
The caution music is so awesome.

969
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:55,230
Where do I go this way?

970
01:17:55,410 --> 01:17:55,570
Wait.

971
01:17:56,050 --> 01:17:57,350
Oh, I think I go this way.

972
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:58,270
Just kidding.

973
01:17:58,490 --> 01:17:59,670
I'm a stupid head.

974
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:06,970
They're gonna see me, so...

975
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:09,690
Freaks a lot.

976
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:16,230
I only buy free range GMO free organic super soldiers.

977
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:17,490
Like Johnny.

978
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:26,840
Let's get my gun at the ready.

979
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:29,440
Actually, let's take some...

980
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,980
Let's eat some ration.

981
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,140
Let's eat some ration and then...

982
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,480
Sorry Snake, I know it's bad.

983
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:47,060
This is horrible.

984
01:18:52,740 --> 01:18:54,440
Is Johnny a super soldier?

985
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:55,480
What are you talking about?

986
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,860
He's absolutely super.

987
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:10,240
Shoot guys, I don't remember where to go at all.

988
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:11,460
Am I going the right way?

989
01:19:11,860 --> 01:19:12,580
I think so.

990
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,000
What's so super about Johnny?

991
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,560
The way his pants just hold it.

992
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,360
I know the guys are gonna see me like immediately if I walk around the corner.

993
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,400
You know what I mean?

994
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:46,400
I see two of them!

995
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,240
Anyone up here?

996
01:19:57,960 --> 01:19:58,880
No, no, no Snake.

997
01:19:59,100 --> 01:19:59,860
I need you to crawl.

998
01:20:10,730 --> 01:20:11,810
What the hell?

999
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:12,310
How?

1000
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:14,870
Why am I holding it like this?

1001
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:17,810
How the hell am I supposed to shoot this?

1002
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:18,490
Snake?

1003
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:21,230
Snake.

1004
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,090
Oh my gosh, thank you guys for the super chat!

1005
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:30,730
Gotta aim it.

1006
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,110
Oh, he's gone.

1007
01:20:37,410 --> 01:20:38,830
Joy, thank you so much!

1008
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:47,250
Oh my gosh, how?

1009
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:48,970
L1 is not working you guys.

1010
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:49,710
Just letting you know.

1011
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:05,760
Wait, how do I get around here?

1012
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:08,080
Oh, here we go.

1013
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:11,040
What the?

1014
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:12,440
Wait, are you stupid?

1015
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:14,480
I think he's dumb.

1016
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,160
Oh my gosh, I think he's really stupid.

1017
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,020
There we go.

1018
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:24,460
Is he coming?

1019
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,330
Sorry, sorry Ocelot unit.

1020
01:21:43,230 --> 01:21:45,490
I shot you in the head!

1021
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,570
How did you survive?

1022
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:50,070
Maybe you guys are the super soldiers.

1023
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,120
Sorry guy.

1024
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:09,520
You okay?

1025
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:27,150
I don't know why it will not let me aim in first person while I'm laying down with this gun.

1026
01:22:27,630 --> 01:22:28,490
Kind of awful.

1027
01:22:30,370 --> 01:22:31,610
Like, how do I do it?

1028
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,360
Just aim real good.

1029
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:45,660
I'm trying!

1030
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,700
Maybe if I...

1031
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:48,000
Okay.

1032
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:51,240
Let's just do it like this.

1033
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:54,960
He doesn't see me.

1034
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:04,110
Oh, sorry for your...

1035
01:23:04,530 --> 01:23:05,470
Sorry for your arm.

1036
01:23:08,310 --> 01:23:08,970
There we go.

1037
01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:11,890
Oh, I see another guy.

1038
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:21,140
That's where I need to go, isn't it?

1039
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:21,860
Like right there.

1040
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,440
Honestly, I could just...

1041
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:27,300
Okay.

1042
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,080
I don't know how to aim with this thing.

1043
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:35,250
And to the right a little.

1044
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:39,290
What do you mean, huh?

1045
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:40,870
Just run!

1046
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,150
Nobody saw me.

1047
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,050
I'm gonna run.

1048
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,140
I'm reloading.

1049
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,720
And the alert is gone.

1050
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,970
Maybe I made it.

1051
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,810
Where's my fork?

1052
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:19,700
He's hiding in the trees!

1053
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:24,260
I'm...

1054
01:24:24,260 --> 01:24:25,360
What are you doing over there?

1055
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,140
What's your arm doing?

1056
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,760
I'm in the jungles of Russia.

1057
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:31,340
Oh, shoot.

1058
01:24:31,540 --> 01:24:32,700
That's not what I meant to do.

1059
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,620
Flush him out!

1060
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:39,420
Oh, gosh.

1061
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:42,720
Go, snake, go.

1062
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,700
That.

1063
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,920
Yeah, he was jorking it in the Russian jungles.

1064
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:02,480
And by it, I mean my rations.

1065
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:06,940
Ramen.

1066
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:09,280
Radio.

1067
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:12,640
Dead body.

1068
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:15,500
Still warm.

1069
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:17,720
Why are you caressing it like that?

1070
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:27,870
Hot lady incoming!

1071
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,340
I'm Tatiana.

1072
01:25:56,370 --> 01:25:57,730
Thank you.

1073
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:58,630
Oh my gosh, thank you.

1074
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,310
I could use my clothes.

1075
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:07,330
I could use a lot of things.

1076
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:09,130
Save, yes.

1077
01:26:10,630 --> 01:26:11,510
New character?

1078
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,790
Chat needs a towel.

1079
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:23,110
Yeah, Eva, I could use a new eye, okay?

1080
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:24,850
But, like...

1081
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:26,610
It makes me cool.

1082
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,990
Oh, boy.

1083
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,310
Oh, he's gonna be chowing down.

1084
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,510
Oh, god.

1085
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,440
He really just knows how to...

1086
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:49,440
How to make a lady just...really...

1087
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,600
Holy golly.

1088
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:59,140
Hey, stop blocking the goods.

1089
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,400
Not for dinner.

1090
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:10,580
In my training, we always got the good stuff.

1091
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:11,700
French, Italian.

1092
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,600
That kind of thing.

1093
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:18,600
The least you could do is call me Cynthia.

1094
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:22,460
I don't get that.

1095
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:31,680
Mata Hari.

1096
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,930
Stop interrupting his meal.

1097
01:27:45,410 --> 01:27:46,950
Holy moly.

1098
01:27:56,950 --> 01:28:00,270
This man has been eating raw fish this whole time.

1099
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:13,090
Stop it.

1100
01:28:15,870 --> 01:28:16,750
No,

1101
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:21,260
I can't see.

1102
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:22,660
My depth perception.

1103
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:44,100
Ow, that hurts, Eva.

1104
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,300
It's still fresh.

1105
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,520
It happened, like, today.

1106
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,820
Eva, it happened, like...

1107
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,660
It's still fresh, Eva.

1108
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:12,250
He's got someone else on the mind, Eva.

1109
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:14,250
Eva, you...

1110
01:29:17,790 --> 01:29:21,010
You are too late, girly.

1111
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:32,430
He's got the mission, you guys.

1112
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,570
It's not time yet.

1113
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:44,830
What's with the sexy music?

1114
01:29:44,830 --> 01:29:45,390
That's a car.

1115
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:12,700
What is happening?

1116
01:30:12,700 --> 01:30:13,820
Like this?

1117
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,460
Pretty good at that.

1118
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,520
Yeah, everybody tells me that.

1119
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:25,440
Hold steady.

1120
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:26,500
I'm not done yet.

1121
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,080
There.

1122
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:30,280
A transmitter.

1123
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:35,060
Is that how they do it in the KGB?

1124
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:36,160
Sometimes.

1125
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,360
Would you rather I did it American style?

1126
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:44,840
How'd you know there was a transmitter lodged there?

1127
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:48,000
That's some female intuition you've got.

1128
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:49,760
Look how excited he is.

1129
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:04,640
I've watched that scene, like, a million times.

1130
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,260
What are you gonna do?

1131
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:10,200
Kiss me every time.

1132
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,080
Wait, do you have that female intuition?

1133
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,540
I think so.

1134
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:21,040
With just this much you could blow up the Shagohat and the lab along with it.

1135
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,660
Oh, I have an update.

1136
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:27,940
I finished the book.

1137
01:31:30,240 --> 01:31:33,000
I finished the Sweet Berries book finally.

1138
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:34,380
Oh my god.

1139
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:36,460
Kojimbo does it again.

1140
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:38,760
Cute.

1141
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,660
I'm gonna shape it into something else.

1142
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,960
I'll just squash it.

1143
01:31:48,860 --> 01:31:50,380
No response.

1144
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,660
Just shoves it in his back pocket.

1145
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,760
The Shagohat's booster unit uses liquid fuel.

1146
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:03,460
The fuel tanks are in the main wing of the weapons lab in the hangar housing the Shagohat itself.

1147
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,160
So I should blow up the tanks?

1148
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:06,720
That's the basic idea.

1149
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:09,040
It should be enough to blow up the entire hangar.

1150
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:11,980
There are four fuel tanks.

1151
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:17,180
In order to destroy the hangar, you'll have to set explosives on each of those tanks.

1152
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:18,380
All four of them?

1153
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:19,980
It should be no sweat for you.

1154
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:23,100
Besides, the scientists had the day off today.

1155
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:25,020
So the hangar is completely deserted.

1156
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:26,060
Not quite.

1157
01:32:26,120 --> 01:32:27,780
They've still got guards posted there.

1158
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:30,260
So what do I do after I set the C3?

1159
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:31,840
The bombs run off the timer.

1160
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:32,940
I wish it was just the guards.

1161
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,440
Once the timer has been set, the countdown will begin.

1162
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:39,500
When the timer reaches zero, the bombs will all go off at once.

1163
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:40,820
How long do I have?

1164
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:41,680
20 minutes.

1165
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:47,460
Once the phase 2 trials are finished, I wouldn't be surprised if they kill all the scientists to prevent them from talking.

1166
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:48,860
So you've got to act fast.

1167
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:50,860
I'll take care of it.

1168
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:54,510
Oh boy.

1169
01:32:56,510 --> 01:33:00,150
Eva, did you get the data on the Shagohod from Sokolov?

1170
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:02,830
Yeah, that's the mission I was given.

1171
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:05,250
By Khrushchev?

1172
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:08,370
America doesn't have any use for it, does it?

1173
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:12,230
But I haven't forgotten my other mission either.

1174
01:33:12,330 --> 01:33:13,030
What's that?

1175
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:16,230
Helping you out.

1176
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:17,210
Oh my god.

1177
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,530
She's so beautiful.

1178
01:33:19,530 --> 01:33:20,990
Oh my god.

1179
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:23,290
Snake has zero interest in her.

1180
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:35,770
He's just so like...

1181
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,410
Every time.

1182
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:41,390
Yeah.

1183
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:44,750
Yeah.

1184
01:33:49,690 --> 01:33:50,150
Yeah.

1185
01:33:52,490 --> 01:33:53,770
He has priorities.

1186
01:33:56,330 --> 01:33:57,190
Yeah, truly.

1187
01:34:02,630 --> 01:34:04,950
I can't wait to see Eva in Delta though.

1188
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:06,250
She is so beautiful.

1189
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,650
So much better than the Apache slot.

1190
01:34:10,810 --> 01:34:11,250
I'm so happy.

1191
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:14,870
I mean, I can't wait to see everybody though.

1192
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:21,170
Oh gosh.

1193
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:27,610
I...

1194
01:34:32,210 --> 01:34:33,610
Eva.

1195
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:47,810
Eva.

1196
01:34:49,530 --> 01:34:50,050
What?

1197
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:58,170
It's just too late, girl.

1198
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,530
You just don't have that freak in you.

1199
01:35:06,350 --> 01:35:08,070
You don't match his freak.

1200
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:13,130
The real you.

1201
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:20,450
What's your name?

1202
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:21,710
Tatiana.

1203
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:22,210
No.

1204
01:35:22,910 --> 01:35:24,130
Your real name.

1205
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:27,210
What's wrong with Tanya?

1206
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:29,090
Okay, Tanya.

1207
01:35:29,610 --> 01:35:30,890
Don't let anyone see you.

1208
01:35:31,650 --> 01:35:32,530
Oh, this?

1209
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:34,530
It's a button camera.

1210
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:37,250
Oh my god.

1211
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:40,190
What did you do that for?

1212
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:41,450
Insurance.

1213
01:35:42,510 --> 01:35:44,210
To make sure you don't double cross me.

1214
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:46,370
Okay.

1215
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:48,490
I would never do that.

1216
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:50,050
And you better not do the same.

1217
01:35:52,470 --> 01:35:53,070
What?

1218
01:35:59,590 --> 01:36:00,490
It's okay.

1219
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:01,550
The wind will dry her.

1220
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:05,450
Oh man.

1221
01:36:07,230 --> 01:36:10,810
That line actually made me tear up a little bit.

1222
01:36:11,590 --> 01:36:11,930
Sorry.

1223
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:14,690
During these cutscenes, I'm just always holding down R1.

1224
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:19,070
Okay.

1225
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:23,350
Let's grab any goodies she left in here for me.

1226
01:36:26,770 --> 01:36:27,450
Warm.

1227
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:31,070
Disinfect.

1228
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,010
Let's see.

1229
01:36:38,330 --> 01:36:39,030
All the bites.

1230
01:36:40,810 --> 01:36:41,470
The bites are so cute.

1231
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:43,310
Wait, what's the original in here?

1232
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:45,830
Oh, the original camera angle is...

1233
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:47,570
You get to see the bites.

1234
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:49,370
Look how cute they are!

1235
01:36:52,910 --> 01:36:53,870
Grab some...

1236
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:55,870
Oh boy, they're giving me a lot of stuff.

1237
01:36:56,890 --> 01:37:00,910
Guys, I don't remember at all the strat for Vulcan.

1238
01:37:02,110 --> 01:37:03,810
So if you guys don't mind...

1239
01:37:05,130 --> 01:37:07,790
Helping a girl out when it comes to time.

1240
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,030
Wait, where's my knife?

1241
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:16,850
You think Eva would ask him to form the beast with two backs?

1242
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:20,670
What is the beast with two backs?

1243
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:23,990
Just finished replaying MGS4, that line hit hard.

1244
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:24,710
I know!

1245
01:37:25,950 --> 01:37:27,790
What's the beast with...

1246
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,230
Two backs?

1247
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,870
No way!

1248
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:39,050
It's two people boinking.

1249
01:37:39,190 --> 01:37:40,010
Is that what it's called?

1250
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:41,070
Wait, that's another name.

1251
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:45,750
It's Shakespeare's term.

1252
01:37:47,090 --> 01:37:48,210
No way!

1253
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,550
Seriously?

1254
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:52,270
I've never heard of that before.

1255
01:37:54,650 --> 01:37:55,850
We need that.

1256
01:37:59,270 --> 01:38:00,390
We need...

1257
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:01,910
Let's get the book.

1258
01:38:02,870 --> 01:38:03,430
Fine.

1259
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:09,510
I want to keep the rotten bat because I want them to get sick.

1260
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:14,390
Shakespeare had some freaky euphemisms.

1261
01:38:15,830 --> 01:38:18,410
The beast with two backs.

1262
01:38:19,470 --> 01:38:21,610
Wait, I forgot my knife.

1263
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:24,630
The beast with two backs.

1264
01:38:25,590 --> 01:38:28,150
The beast with two backs.

1265
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:30,290
Wow.

1266
01:38:30,970 --> 01:38:33,130
The beast with two backs.

1267
01:38:42,140 --> 01:38:44,400
Beast with two backs.

1268
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:47,000
I like how it stops glowing.

1269
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:49,880
There was some food here.

1270
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:52,240
Yeah, let's grab some food while we're here as well.

1271
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,100
Some little froggies.

1272
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:56,640
Come here.

1273
01:38:57,720 --> 01:38:58,280
Come here.

1274
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:02,280
Beast with two backs.

1275
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:11,890
Beast with three backs.

1276
01:39:13,510 --> 01:39:15,610
Let's not get ahead of ourselves now.

1277
01:39:18,830 --> 01:39:19,270
Rat.

1278
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:26,180
Take you.

1279
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,280
Wait, do I not have enough room maybe?

1280
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:33,580
Snake.

1281
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:35,620
Just, snake.

1282
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,220
I've never seen you use a death pill for bosses.

1283
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,420
You get a free hit on all the bosses if you use one.

1284
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:45,160
Because I don't need to play dead.

1285
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:46,880
I'm just too good.

1286
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,620
I'm just that good where I don't need to play dead at all.

1287
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:52,540
Nice.

1288
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:57,380
Oh wait, how much food do we have anyway?

1289
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:01,280
You're already dead.

1290
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:02,500
That too.

1291
01:40:02,620 --> 01:40:03,880
Oh, I don't have a lot of food at all.

1292
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,180
Let's stock up.

1293
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:05,920
Let's stock up.

1294
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,800
We got the box!

1295
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,700
Exciting times.

1296
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,540
Beast with two backs.

1297
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:17,760
I wonder what that tastes like.

1298
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:18,800
Snake probably.

1299
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,060
He would ask.

1300
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:22,800
He would wonder.

1301
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:30,620
You know those memes that's like knows what... knows what boinking is, boinks.

1302
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:33,820
Does not know what the boinking is, doesn't boink.

1303
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:39,000
I feel like Snake does not know but still boinks.

1304
01:40:44,120 --> 01:40:45,860
Oh, I forgot to say.

1305
01:40:46,360 --> 01:40:46,780
Oh my gosh.

1306
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:49,980
I finished the book.

1307
01:40:50,380 --> 01:40:53,640
Update on the book time before we head on inside.

1308
01:40:54,240 --> 01:40:55,520
Okay, so I finished the book.

1309
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:58,000
Thank god because I...

1310
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,640
I hated this book.

1311
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:08,660
So for those who don't know, I was reading a sequel to the Minotaur Milking Farm and it was about a lady and her mothman buddy.

1312
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,740
And it was just so... Oh my gosh.

1313
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,160
I hated the girl.

1314
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,660
I hated the guy.

1315
01:41:17,020 --> 01:41:18,100
I hated the writing.

1316
01:41:18,820 --> 01:41:20,820
Everything about it was just...

1317
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:27,400
I would like fall asleep and then I would have to remember and I would like finish the book in my sleep, right?

1318
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,240
So I didn't know where I left off.

1319
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:32,400
But I would have to find where I left off.

1320
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:42,260
And let me tell you, the book repeats lines so often that I was physically groaning.

1321
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:47,460
I was just like, oh my god, I cannot hear her say this line one more time.

1322
01:41:47,540 --> 01:41:49,740
It was so bad.

1323
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,120
Okay, let me tell you.

1324
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:57,260
The first line was she would always say, here for a good time, not a long time.

1325
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:05,640
And she would be trying not to fall in love with this mothman but she would always be like, here for a good time, not a long time.

1326
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,860
Just don't fall in love with him.

1327
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,300
And I'm like, oh god, shut up!

1328
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:16,780
And then always, the second thing she would always talk about is how adorable his little chirps and clicks are.

1329
01:42:16,780 --> 01:42:23,780
And that just drove, she would be like, he's just so adorable when he started doing his little chirps.

1330
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:29,900
Or every time I said something and he would chirp and it was just the most adorkable thing.

1331
01:42:30,540 --> 01:42:35,300
God, I wanted to strangle the main lady.

1332
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:41,420
I seriously, oh my god, I was losing my mind because she would say it every two sentences.

1333
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,440
It was so annoying.

1334
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:52,960
And then, the other thing that she would say is, she would talk about his like, his neck fluff.

1335
01:42:53,240 --> 01:42:58,340
Every two seconds she would be like, I buried my head into his fluffy neck fluff.

1336
01:42:58,660 --> 01:43:00,620
Oh, I stroked his neck fluff.

1337
01:43:01,020 --> 01:43:03,380
I wondered about the smell of his neck fluff.

1338
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:04,360
Shut up!

1339
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:05,660
Shut up!

1340
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:10,360
Oh my god, I was losing my mind because it was so awful.

1341
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:15,340
And then, oh my god.

1342
01:43:15,860 --> 01:43:19,940
Basically, I was just so ready to be done with the book.

1343
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:24,800
And then, okay, let me tell you why I also just hate these characters.

1344
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:29,500
First of all, the guy is just stupid.

1345
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:32,700
He's just, he doesn't communicate well and that annoys me.

1346
01:43:32,960 --> 01:43:36,700
But then second, the girl is kind of awful.

1347
01:43:36,700 --> 01:43:46,500
So, in this world, in this world, there are, there are, there are creatures with innies, which is not a belly button.

1348
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:51,980
It's their, it's their, it's their, you know, other appendages.

1349
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,840
And then there's ones with outies.

1350
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,720
If they are outies, they must wear pants.

1351
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,540
But if they're innies, they don't have to wear pants.

1352
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:09,900
But then there's like this whole side plot about her having to appeal to the werewolf people because one of them is going to become mayor.

1353
01:44:10,340 --> 01:44:15,540
And they, he doesn't want people, or animal people to not wear pants.

1354
01:44:15,660 --> 01:44:18,800
He wants everyone to wear pants and clothes and stuff.

1355
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:22,520
And she's just like, but the mothman guy, he doesn't wear pants.

1356
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:25,260
And she's just like, we need to get you some pants.

1357
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,860
And he's like, I don't like pants.

1358
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:29,360
And she's like, no, no, no, we're getting you pants.

1359
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,700
And I'm like, what, why don't you accept him?

1360
01:44:31,880 --> 01:44:36,060
I thought it was going to turn into like, because she was, the whole time she was like supporting this guy.

1361
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:41,980
And I thought it was going to turn into like a, oh, you know what?

1362
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,680
I'm going to stand up against the guy and say, you know what?

1363
01:44:44,840 --> 01:44:46,560
Against the mayor and say, you know what?

1364
01:44:46,780 --> 01:44:49,860
My mothman, he doesn't need to wear pants.

1365
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:56,680
And instead, no, she just gives it, she's just like, she's just like, oh no, we're getting you pants.

1366
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,100
Don't you want to be accepted by everyone else in the town?

1367
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:00,420
You have to wear pants.

1368
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:04,180
And he's like, oh, I don't really like the feel of pants.

1369
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:07,840
All clothes are kind of restricting for me because I'm a mothman and nothing fits.

1370
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:10,980
And she's like, no, we're getting you pants.

1371
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:12,460
And I'm like, what?

1372
01:45:13,100 --> 01:45:16,940
I thought she was going to like, I thought she was going to be on his side.

1373
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:21,360
And instead she's just like, no, you need to conform to the city.

1374
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:28,320
You need to, if you're going to live here with me, you need to, you need to be like everybody else and you need to blend in.

1375
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,880
Mothman oppression.

1376
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:30,540
I know!

1377
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:35,300
I was so, I was so, I was like, wait, what?

1378
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:39,020
But he says he doesn't like them.

1379
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,300
It's so mean.

1380
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:44,520
You will wear pants, you will eat slop, you will boycott.

1381
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,280
This is any erasure.

1382
01:45:51,620 --> 01:45:53,060
He deserves better.

1383
01:45:53,060 --> 01:45:59,640
It was making me actually so mad because I was like, this guy doesn't like wearing pants.

1384
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:01,140
And she was so adamant.

1385
01:46:01,340 --> 01:46:08,460
Like every, after, like the mayor or the future mayor, I guess, she was so insistent that he was going to become mayor.

1386
01:46:08,540 --> 01:46:10,020
The guy wasn't even mayor yet.

1387
01:46:10,540 --> 01:46:17,660
She was just like, he came to where she worked one day and saw that he wasn't wearing pants and like glared at him.

1388
01:46:17,660 --> 01:46:21,900
And then, sorry, your Mothman smite was poorly written.

1389
01:46:23,240 --> 01:46:28,340
But then, literally right afterwards, she like looks at the Mothman guy and she's like all embarrassed.

1390
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,140
She's like, we need to get you pants, like right now.

1391
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:31,440
And I'm like, what?

1392
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,300
Banning pants, is this strike witches now?

1393
01:46:34,420 --> 01:46:34,760
Yes!

1394
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:40,080
I was so angry.

1395
01:46:40,200 --> 01:46:41,180
Yeah, she's toxic.

1396
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:43,340
She was very toxic.

1397
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:47,040
I was angry for him, even though I didn't like him.

1398
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:49,060
I didn't like her more.

1399
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:50,500
I was like, this lady sucks.

1400
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:52,220
So you don't recommend the book?

1401
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:52,640
No.

1402
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,440
The first book was good.

1403
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:56,700
This one was so bad.

1404
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,300
I was so angry.

1405
01:46:59,260 --> 01:47:04,600
And then she was just like, if you don't wear pants, anyone can touch you down there.

1406
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:08,780
And, you know, you're only for me.

1407
01:47:09,180 --> 01:47:14,820
And he's just like, no, because it's like a vacuum or something.

1408
01:47:14,820 --> 01:47:16,760
He's like...

1409
01:47:17,620 --> 01:47:20,640
He's like, I just vacuum seal it shut.

1410
01:47:25,900 --> 01:47:27,720
And guess what, guys?

1411
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:29,920
She became boneless!

1412
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:37,520
At one point she was like, I was lying on my bed boneless.

1413
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,020
This Mothman lore is gone.

1414
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:45,140
There's so many twists and turns.

1415
01:47:46,140 --> 01:47:48,920
She said that she became boneless!

1416
01:47:52,820 --> 01:47:54,500
Oh, gosh.

1417
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:02,360
I have... I think I have like...

1418
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:10,940
I feel like I need like a little bit of therapy from the imagery in this book in particular.

1419
01:48:12,900 --> 01:48:16,360
Oh, it was just... A lot of it was just really...

1420
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:19,340
Oh, gosh.

1421
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,620
A minty-made ghost.

1422
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:28,000
Wonder what that tastes like.

1423
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,480
A snake in midstream.

1424
01:48:33,580 --> 01:48:35,020
She became a chicken wing.

1425
01:48:35,220 --> 01:48:35,660
Real.

1426
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:37,320
Yeah.

1427
01:48:38,120 --> 01:48:39,640
Looks like this are curling me.

1428
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:40,760
Me too.

1429
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,040
That's why I listen to them.

1430
01:48:43,540 --> 01:48:45,960
I read them so you don't have to and then I report them back.

1431
01:48:47,200 --> 01:48:47,720
You're welcome.

1432
01:48:48,580 --> 01:48:51,040
I didn't even tell you some of the worst parts about it.

1433
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,760
And honestly, I don't want to repeat them.

1434
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,240
I don't want to repeat them.

1435
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:06,120
We now know an impressive amount of this book series now.

1436
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:09,540
We could use this knowledge for a great conversation starter at parties.

1437
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,040
Both men deserve better.

1438
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:11,740
You could!

1439
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,580
How is she going to wear pants if she is boneless?

1440
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,380
I know!

1441
01:49:17,460 --> 01:49:18,340
Oh, gosh.

1442
01:49:19,620 --> 01:49:20,620
Oh, gosh.

1443
01:49:25,380 --> 01:49:26,400
Mint please, we need more.

1444
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:29,140
I don't want to talk about it.

1445
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:30,800
Is there a sequel?

1446
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,180
Apparently there is a third book.

1447
01:49:32,220 --> 01:49:33,740
At the very end they gave...

1448
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:40,960
Okay, so it was like they had an epilogue chapter that was like I guess the first...

1449
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:43,000
Or like the beginning of a third book.

1450
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:46,060
This is weird.

1451
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,620
I was just lying in bed last night trying to fall asleep.

1452
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:54,320
And they finished the book.

1453
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:58,680
Or they finished this like little... It was about like a werewolf and then...

1454
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:05,680
He's like... There's like a place for interspecies couples...

1455
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:11,880
Where if they can't have a kid but want a kid, they instead hire a werewolf to...

1456
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,160
To boink the other werewolf so that they can have a kid.

1457
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:18,800
But...

1458
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,680
I'm like, I don't... Isn't that kind of...

1459
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,840
It's like actual NTR, right?

1460
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:43,970
But it ends... Oh gosh.

1461
01:50:45,210 --> 01:50:49,110
When I heard this I was like, no, no, I can't do this.

1462
01:50:49,650 --> 01:50:50,050
No.

1463
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:52,150
It said...

1464
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,090
Join us...

1465
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:57,390
Join us on this...

1466
01:50:57,910 --> 01:51:00,750
16 book part series.

1467
01:51:02,710 --> 01:51:03,150
Ah!

1468
01:51:06,130 --> 01:51:07,010
16 books!

1469
01:51:07,370 --> 01:51:08,130
I can't, no.

1470
01:51:08,450 --> 01:51:10,070
No, I tap out.

1471
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,710
I tap out, you guys.

1472
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,570
I can't do it.

1473
01:51:16,070 --> 01:51:16,510
16!

1474
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:21,110
I don't know if they are all part of the same city or whatever.

1475
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:22,990
I guess so.

1476
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:24,110
The first one is Minotaur.

1477
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:25,590
The second one is Mothman.

1478
01:51:25,670 --> 01:51:26,830
The third one is Werewolf.

1479
01:51:26,830 --> 01:51:29,170
The world is our oyster.

1480
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:31,030
We can only go up from here.

1481
01:51:31,210 --> 01:51:32,310
I don't know.

1482
01:51:32,570 --> 01:51:34,830
Also, at one point...

1483
01:51:35,510 --> 01:51:36,450
They were like...

1484
01:51:38,290 --> 01:51:40,830
I'm confused because...

1485
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:46,210
The Mothman was a scientist and he was studying hummingbirds.

1486
01:51:46,930 --> 01:51:51,590
Also, they went to an ice cream place and one had aphids in it.

1487
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,410
She was like, I don't know what Mothman eat.

1488
01:51:53,830 --> 01:51:54,890
Do you want aphids?

1489
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:56,290
He was like, aphids?

1490
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:57,170
Are you crazy?

1491
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:58,710
She was like, I don't know.

1492
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:01,290
But...

1493
01:52:04,890 --> 01:52:05,310
But...

1494
01:52:06,570 --> 01:52:08,210
A Mothman is an insect.

1495
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:13,050
He was looking after hummingbirds and butterflies.

1496
01:52:14,110 --> 01:52:17,110
Are there butterfly people?

1497
01:52:18,770 --> 01:52:20,050
Do it for the content.

1498
01:52:20,310 --> 01:52:21,190
Oh gosh.

1499
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:22,690
Are there butterfly people?

1500
01:52:22,930 --> 01:52:25,330
What do you mean VOD watchers skip 30 minutes ahead?

1501
01:52:25,430 --> 01:52:26,310
This is content!

1502
01:52:28,570 --> 01:52:29,530
Are there butterfly people?

1503
01:52:29,690 --> 01:52:33,450
Why is he a Mothman but there is not a butterfly man or butterfly woman?

1504
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:36,570
Why is there...

1505
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:39,410
Are there also hummingbird people?

1506
01:52:39,930 --> 01:52:41,070
Where does it end?

1507
01:52:43,230 --> 01:52:44,390
I'm confused.

1508
01:52:46,090 --> 01:52:47,250
I'm confused.

1509
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:56,510
Also, I couldn't get it out of my head because he would like, talk to her while they were doing sexy time.

1510
01:52:57,470 --> 01:53:03,770
He would talk to her but his little moth tongue was like, out on the floor.

1511
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:10,490
And the whole time I'm just thinking of him being like, oh yeah, you're so beautiful.

1512
01:53:19,570 --> 01:53:21,210
What did I tune into?

1513
01:53:21,330 --> 01:53:21,590
Sorry.

1514
01:53:22,150 --> 01:53:25,670
I'm giving a final update to the book I've been reading.

1515
01:53:26,590 --> 01:53:28,090
So guys, I finished the 15th book.

1516
01:53:28,230 --> 01:53:30,330
Bigfoot finished Deli.

1517
01:53:34,090 --> 01:53:36,790
Yeah, so this is Monster Musume for normies.

1518
01:53:36,930 --> 01:53:39,770
It's extremely anime coded but yeah, basically.

1519
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:41,430
Wasn't he voiced?

1520
01:53:41,530 --> 01:53:44,930
Yeah, but of course the... Oh my gosh, here's the kicker guys.

1521
01:53:45,030 --> 01:53:51,070
Here's the final... Here is the final piece of this cake.

1522
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:55,250
This cake that... I don't even... The pie.

1523
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:57,790
You know what the narrator's name is?

1524
01:53:59,050 --> 01:54:03,710
At the very end I had to hear her say it and I was like, oh my god.

1525
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:10,250
The narrator, the lady who was voicing the audio book, her name is Eva!

1526
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:18,390
Oh my gosh.

1527
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:21,190
Wait, cell type, you were so close.

1528
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:23,150
Eva Tatiana, her name was Eva!

1529
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:29,790
Oh my gosh, full circle reel.

1530
01:54:29,970 --> 01:54:30,890
Anyway, alright.

1531
01:54:31,350 --> 01:54:34,270
Sorry, I just had to talk about that for a little bit.

1532
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:43,740
Okie dokie.

1533
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:45,260
Oh gosh.

1534
01:54:46,140 --> 01:54:46,860
Okie dokie.

1535
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:50,380
Wait, can I put on... What outfit can I wear here?

1536
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:53,140
I can't wear Rykov anymore, right?

1537
01:54:53,620 --> 01:54:55,660
But I can wear the scientist, right?

1538
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,760
It was all one big Metal Gear reference.

1539
01:55:10,620 --> 01:55:12,040
Don't you have the sorrow camel?

1540
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:14,760
I don't think I got that, did I?

1541
01:55:15,540 --> 01:55:16,480
Oh I did!

1542
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,340
The sorrow camel uniform!

1543
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:25,140
Wait, what's the special thing about this one?

1544
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:30,240
Spooky.

1545
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,680
Silence footsteps.

1546
01:55:32,840 --> 01:55:34,000
Oh that's right, that's right.

1547
01:55:34,180 --> 01:55:34,720
Codec with it.

1548
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:35,440
Yeah, yeah, we'll see.

1549
01:55:43,070 --> 01:55:43,510
Oh, hold on.

1550
01:55:46,190 --> 01:55:47,490
Not a bad idea.

1551
01:55:50,350 --> 01:55:51,750
We started a good term.

1552
01:55:52,750 --> 01:55:54,210
Spiky flames.

1553
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:08,370
Ok, no pressure.

1554
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:10,070
No pressure.

1555
01:56:24,490 --> 01:56:28,050
Is it SIGINT?

1556
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:31,130
Oh wait, yeah SIGINT tells me about Camel.

1557
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:43,310
SIGINT.

1558
01:56:53,210 --> 01:56:54,090
Yeah.

1559
01:57:00,390 --> 01:57:01,270
See?

1560
01:57:01,950 --> 01:57:05,130
AI is not gonna take our jobs.

1561
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:06,590
We need the humans.

1562
01:57:25,350 --> 01:57:29,450
Snake talking about someone's social problems is insane.

1563
01:57:29,930 --> 01:57:30,370
Snake!

1564
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:38,150
Oh I thought he meant like his personality.

1565
01:57:39,550 --> 01:57:42,290
Because Snake's personality is...

1566
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:56,410
Aww.

1567
01:57:58,390 --> 01:57:59,750
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

1568
01:58:00,390 --> 01:58:01,910
You can hack the system.

1569
01:58:03,610 --> 01:58:05,530
Anybody can hack the system.

1570
01:58:06,510 --> 01:58:07,550
Let's talk to Zero real quick.

1571
01:58:14,210 --> 01:58:18,070
Guys, I don't remember the strat for Vulcan.

1572
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:18,890
I need your help.

1573
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:23,230
Hacking into the gate.

1574
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:27,050
No!

1575
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:31,010
Ok

1576
01:58:51,850 --> 01:58:54,270
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1577
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,290
You'll remember when you fight him.

1578
01:58:55,330 --> 01:58:56,050
I don't think I will.

1579
01:58:58,550 --> 01:58:59,310
We'll see though.

1580
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:03,770
I remember more of the Shagglehug fight than the fight with him.

1581
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:10,230
Are you gonna tell me about the Camel?

1582
01:59:10,590 --> 01:59:11,270
Oh there we go.

1583
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:13,670
There we go, there we go.

1584
01:59:17,490 --> 01:59:18,290
The sorrow.

1585
01:59:21,870 --> 01:59:23,270
Hehehe

1586
01:59:35,990 --> 01:59:38,790
It did!

1587
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:38,950
Yeah.

1588
01:59:41,690 --> 01:59:42,130
What?

1589
01:59:49,610 --> 01:59:50,050
Alrighty.

1590
01:59:51,070 --> 01:59:52,790
We'll save once we...

1591
01:59:53,450 --> 01:59:54,250
Oh no, no, no.

1592
01:59:54,310 --> 01:59:55,710
I didn't mean to...

1593
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:57,230
Oh, I'm not wearing any face paint.

1594
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:57,790
You're right.

1595
01:59:58,550 --> 01:59:59,370
Thank you, second.

1596
02:00:01,330 --> 02:00:02,830
I'm not wearing any face paint.

1597
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:05,010
Camouflage.

1598
02:00:06,070 --> 02:00:07,050
Let's see.

1599
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:08,470
Oh, Splitter my favorite.

1600
02:00:08,610 --> 02:00:09,190
Wait, zombie?

1601
02:00:09,550 --> 02:00:11,870
Zombie with the sorrow?

1602
02:00:13,070 --> 02:00:14,090
But Splitter is my favorite.

1603
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:15,890
Ok.

1604
02:00:16,670 --> 02:00:17,310
Zombie?

1605
02:00:17,490 --> 02:00:18,790
Ok, we'll go with zombie.

1606
02:00:20,430 --> 02:00:21,650
Look how cool!

1607
02:00:22,710 --> 02:00:23,910
Oh my gosh.

1608
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:25,990
Zombie for Halloween.

1609
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:28,290
Alright.

1610
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:29,510
Let's go.

1611
02:00:29,510 --> 02:00:29,770
Nice.

1612
02:00:39,470 --> 02:00:41,530
I don't wanna be back here.

1613
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:43,370
Oh, Eva!

1614
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:44,530
Yeah, I forgot to call Eva.

1615
02:00:45,290 --> 02:00:45,950
Gotta call her.

1616
02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:46,390
Hold on.

1617
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:49,970
Oh, goodness.

1618
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:56,190
Hurry up, snake.

1619
02:00:57,850 --> 02:00:58,810
Hurry up and get out.

1620
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:01,530
Meow.

1621
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:05,850
Snake, hide!

1622
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:10,750
Hide, snake!

1623
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:13,490
Oh my gosh.

1624
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:15,410
What if they park on top of that?

1625
02:01:15,490 --> 02:01:18,510
We never... If we had waited any longer...

1626
02:01:20,610 --> 02:01:21,930
Oh my gosh!

1627
02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:26,450
Oh my

1628
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:39,060
gosh!

1629
02:01:41,720 --> 02:01:43,660
We would have been in bad trouble.

1630
02:01:44,420 --> 02:01:45,580
Who could have known?

1631
02:01:49,900 --> 02:01:50,380
Alrighty.

1632
02:01:52,380 --> 02:01:55,340
So if I can't... Can I be a scientist here?

1633
02:01:55,480 --> 02:01:56,540
I can though.

1634
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,320
Inside I need the janitor's outfit.

1635
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,580
But, can I be a scientist here?

1636
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,080
I can't remember.

1637
02:02:06,180 --> 02:02:07,160
Yeah, I can, right?

1638
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:08,540
Ok, let's call Eva real quick.

1639
02:02:13,020 --> 02:02:19,260
You can get into the hangar through the door located at the entrance to the main wing on the second floor of the east wing.

1640
02:02:19,820 --> 02:02:20,140
Hurry!

1641
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:21,120
Hurry!

1642
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:23,040
But Eva, did you take my food?

1643
02:02:24,060 --> 02:02:28,080
Eva, didn't you take a picture of me when I was about to leave the waterfall cave?

1644
02:02:28,680 --> 02:02:29,040
No, that.

1645
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:32,100
That's a button-shaped hidden camera developed by the KGB.

1646
02:02:32,360 --> 02:02:32,560
Wow.

1647
02:02:32,700 --> 02:02:35,160
I use it to take pictures of the fortress and Shagahan.

1648
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:35,920
That's so Detective Conan.

1649
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:36,240
No.

1650
02:02:37,860 --> 02:02:39,560
Why did you take a picture of me?

1651
02:02:40,180 --> 02:02:41,940
Because I wanted a picture of you.

1652
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:43,600
Can I have it, Eva?

1653
02:02:47,140 --> 02:02:48,380
Eva, can I get that picture?

1654
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:49,600
Can you make a copy for me?

1655
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,320
Please, Eva.

1656
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:06,200
My Rykov disguise.

1657
02:03:12,740 --> 02:03:13,600
Ok.

1658
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:21,940
With a box?

1659
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:23,540
Perhaps?

1660
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,440
Ok, ok.

1661
02:03:34,030 --> 02:03:35,810
Let's equip my box.

1662
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:37,810
Where is box C that I just got?

1663
02:03:42,030 --> 02:03:43,070
Box, box...

1664
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:44,110
Box B.

1665
02:03:44,230 --> 02:03:45,230
Oh, C, box B.

1666
02:03:55,610 --> 02:03:56,810
Splitter, splitter.

1667
02:03:59,170 --> 02:04:00,210
It works.

1668
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:02,230
It's pretty crazy.

1669
02:04:03,590 --> 02:04:03,930
Alright.

1670
02:04:05,730 --> 02:04:06,250
Splitter.

1671
02:04:06,390 --> 02:04:07,370
Oh, that's a doubt.

1672
02:04:08,990 --> 02:04:11,250
And any people...is it this?

1673
02:04:11,570 --> 02:04:13,350
Wait, what's the car that I can go into?

1674
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:17,410
For...

1675
02:04:17,410 --> 02:04:18,970
What kind of truck is it?

1676
02:04:23,490 --> 02:04:25,030
It's not this one, obviously.

1677
02:04:27,990 --> 02:04:29,330
Is it...that one over there?

1678
02:04:30,010 --> 02:04:31,270
No, not that...oh, wait.

1679
02:04:32,390 --> 02:04:33,170
Wait, can I get in here?

1680
02:04:33,950 --> 02:04:34,770
Near the walkway.

1681
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:36,370
Where's the walkway?

1682
02:04:41,030 --> 02:04:45,210
I like how it says it silences my footsteps, but it doesn't feel like it, you know what I mean?

1683
02:04:45,550 --> 02:04:46,830
It scares me still.

1684
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:49,090
Oh my gosh, there's two guys there.

1685
02:04:49,690 --> 02:04:51,330
Wait, this is...

1686
02:04:51,330 --> 02:04:53,090
This is a moment of...

1687
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:54,510
What's wrong?

1688
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:57,390
This is a what's wrong loop.

1689
02:04:59,310 --> 02:05:00,670
This is a what's wrong loop.

1690
02:05:01,630 --> 02:05:03,030
Oh no, don't get him.

1691
02:05:03,230 --> 02:05:05,130
No wait, why did you crouch?

1692
02:05:06,190 --> 02:05:06,710
Shit.

1693
02:05:10,350 --> 02:05:11,010
What the?

1694
02:05:12,130 --> 02:05:14,090
How did you...

1695
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:15,850
This is HQ.

1696
02:05:17,050 --> 02:05:17,770
Patrol here.

1697
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:21,890
Where did that other guy go?

1698
02:05:21,950 --> 02:05:22,490
He disappeared.

1699
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:24,410
Oh shoot.

1700
02:05:24,730 --> 02:05:25,690
I'm gonna go into a box.

1701
02:05:38,690 --> 02:05:40,770
I didn't even think I had that equipped.

1702
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:51,100
That's why I did it with...

1703
02:05:55,620 --> 02:05:56,260
Oh...

1704
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,140
You wanna save?

1705
02:06:04,620 --> 02:06:05,500
Hold on a sec.

1706
02:06:10,180 --> 02:06:11,140
Whoopsie-poopsie.

1707
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:14,000
Permanent tranquilizer.

1708
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:15,700
I didn't even notice.

1709
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,300
I'm gonna do a new file.

1710
02:06:20,020 --> 02:06:20,800
Did you enjoy the killing?

1711
02:06:20,920 --> 02:06:21,300
No!

1712
02:06:22,480 --> 02:06:23,260
What's wrong?

1713
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:23,860
Denied.

1714
02:06:24,040 --> 02:06:26,600
Oh my gosh, I almost...Oh my gosh!

1715
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:29,620
Saving after you killed a dude.

1716
02:06:29,700 --> 02:06:31,620
Well I forgot to save before I killed him.

1717
02:06:32,500 --> 02:06:35,080
Oh I've seen North by Northwest.

1718
02:06:36,620 --> 02:06:39,540
I like this one actually.

1719
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:45,300
It's a...not Hitchcock is it?

1720
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:48,140
Maybe it is Hitchcock.

1721
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:52,680
Yes it is Hitchcock.

1722
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:53,260
Oh I thought so.

1723
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:53,860
Yeah, yeah.

1724
02:07:01,060 --> 02:07:01,420
Yeah.

1725
02:07:15,980 --> 02:07:16,340
Rebecca.

1726
02:07:18,360 --> 02:07:19,380
I don't know that one.

1727
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:26,380
She saw the dead in that river and wanted to send more people there.

1728
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:31,780
You wanna know what's wrong but instead got a what's wrong with you.

1729
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:47,180
I wonder if that's also Kojima's first, you know.

1730
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:51,380
I might wanna just restart this section, I'm not gonna lie.

1731
02:07:53,420 --> 02:07:54,640
I'm not in your way.

1732
02:07:55,140 --> 02:07:56,400
Don't even act like I am.

1733
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:01,860
Don't even act like I'm...don't, don't.

1734
02:08:01,980 --> 02:08:02,800
What are you doing here?

1735
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:04,080
Go away!

1736
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,080
Oh my god.

1737
02:08:09,720 --> 02:08:10,960
Just a vaccine.

1738
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:25,600
Holy cow, I thought...I thought he was gonna go like...

1739
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:27,920
You know, I thought he was gonna do his little thing.

1740
02:08:28,440 --> 02:08:29,500
He didn't though.

1741
02:08:31,940 --> 02:08:32,940
We...gamed for real.

1742
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:35,100
Are they gonna look around?

1743
02:08:37,640 --> 02:08:38,540
There's no one else right?

1744
02:08:48,140 --> 02:08:49,780
Can I go up through there?

1745
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:52,120
Wait, which is the place I need to go to?

1746
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:54,320
Ma...

1747
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:59,980
Like, I know how I got there before.

1748
02:09:01,900 --> 02:09:04,720
Can I go up through that door up there though?

1749
02:09:12,160 --> 02:09:14,440
I wish I could shoot from my box.

1750
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,960
This door is still locked.

1751
02:09:23,100 --> 02:09:24,020
Okay, thank you.

1752
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,680
We'll run once this guy turns around.

1753
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:29,820
Oh my gosh, I just saw the guy up there.

1754
02:09:31,900 --> 02:09:33,600
Holy moly, he would have seen me.

1755
02:09:33,660 --> 02:09:34,580
He would have spotted me probably.

1756
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:40,480
I don't know where those other guys went, so I'm a little nervous to get out of my box.

1757
02:09:45,590 --> 02:09:46,890
Okay, first...Oh my gosh.

1758
02:09:47,470 --> 02:09:47,990
There they are.

1759
02:09:48,890 --> 02:09:50,030
Take out this guy first.

1760
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:51,250
If I can.

1761
02:09:53,690 --> 02:09:54,530
Dang it.

1762
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:56,450
Oh, don't move.

1763
02:09:56,850 --> 02:09:57,790
Wait, is he in a glass?

1764
02:09:57,790 --> 02:09:59,150
No, he's outside.

1765
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:11,110
Oh my gosh, control.

1766
02:10:11,690 --> 02:10:12,210
Nice.

1767
02:10:17,060 --> 02:10:17,980
There's a guy there.

1768
02:10:20,980 --> 02:10:21,560
Oh my gosh.

1769
02:10:21,720 --> 02:10:22,140
No, no, no.

1770
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:24,840
HQ.

1771
02:10:26,900 --> 02:10:28,260
Oh, what are you doing?

1772
02:10:28,860 --> 02:10:29,980
Are you just chilling?

1773
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:33,180
Okay, good night.

1774
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:34,960
Oh no!

1775
02:10:38,020 --> 02:10:39,100
Wait a second.

1776
02:10:39,900 --> 02:10:42,060
Return to your positions, sirs.

1777
02:10:43,340 --> 02:10:44,740
He's taking a nap.

1778
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:51,190
They're leaving?

1779
02:10:51,610 --> 02:10:52,990
Hold on, I'm going to box.

1780
02:10:58,290 --> 02:11:01,070
This is why we box, everybody.

1781
02:11:01,070 --> 02:11:03,350
This is why we box.

1782
02:11:04,430 --> 02:11:05,830
This is why we box.

1783
02:11:05,990 --> 02:11:07,550
Oh my gosh, he's going to notice this guy too.

1784
02:11:09,950 --> 02:11:12,070
What if I just go...

1785
02:11:14,030 --> 02:11:15,270
Oh, he didn't notice him.

1786
02:11:16,470 --> 02:11:17,230
They're dumb.

1787
02:11:17,450 --> 02:11:18,150
They're so stupid.

1788
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:19,530
Let's go.

1789
02:11:20,530 --> 02:11:21,110
Hi, run.

1790
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:26,430
So, here...

1791
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:26,990
Yeah.

1792
02:11:29,190 --> 02:11:29,950
Northeast.

1793
02:11:37,150 --> 02:11:38,670
Move who?

1794
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:45,040
Who are we telling to move?

1795
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:47,860
Who are we calling a bastard?

1796
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:50,900
Move!

1797
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:53,240
Oh my gosh.

1798
02:11:54,120 --> 02:11:57,080
Oh my gosh, stop bullying him!

1799
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:58,520
Stop bullying him!

1800
02:12:04,350 --> 02:12:05,350
They're going.

1801
02:12:06,990 --> 02:12:07,890
I think.

1802
02:12:08,530 --> 02:12:09,390
It's this building.

1803
02:12:09,710 --> 02:12:12,130
The door is like right...Oh gosh.

1804
02:12:12,290 --> 02:12:15,010
How the hell am I supposed to get to here?

1805
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:18,590
Faster.

1806
02:12:19,070 --> 02:12:19,610
Oh, bastard.

1807
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:20,130
Sorry.

1808
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:21,670
Move.

1809
02:12:22,850 --> 02:12:23,470
What are they doing?

1810
02:12:23,530 --> 02:12:24,350
I think they're doing...

1811
02:12:25,010 --> 02:12:28,130
What's that exercise where you run back and forth?

1812
02:12:28,270 --> 02:12:29,230
Why are they crawling?

1813
02:12:29,470 --> 02:12:30,850
Why are they running like this?

1814
02:12:31,930 --> 02:12:32,970
You lousy!

1815
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:42,460
Um...

1816
02:12:42,460 --> 02:12:45,840
There's like a bunch of guys here, you guys.

1817
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:47,080
Can I even get in through here?

1818
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:48,960
You lousy!

1819
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:52,440
Maybe if I use like a grenade or something.

1820
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:54,980
Like a...

1821
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:03,000
You lousy!

1822
02:13:08,110 --> 02:13:09,830
I can't see anything.

1823
02:13:09,830 --> 02:13:11,310
Oh gosh.

1824
02:13:11,590 --> 02:13:13,470
This camera angle is so awful.

1825
02:13:15,770 --> 02:13:16,830
You lousy!

1826
02:13:18,330 --> 02:13:18,770
Run.

1827
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:24,250
I made it.

1828
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:33,800
Anybody?

1829
02:13:33,900 --> 02:13:34,660
Ok, there's a door.

1830
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:38,520
There's a guy right there.

1831
02:13:39,380 --> 02:13:40,280
That I can see.

1832
02:13:41,880 --> 02:13:42,800
You lousy!

1833
02:13:44,240 --> 02:13:46,960
OG camera my belo...Oh there's a guy right there too!

1834
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:48,820
Oh my gosh.

1835
02:13:49,240 --> 02:13:50,340
OG camera saved me.

1836
02:13:51,620 --> 02:13:52,760
I wouldn't have seen him.

1837
02:13:52,860 --> 02:13:54,900
Look, he's looking right at me too.

1838
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:56,920
You lousy!

1839
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:09,520
Where is he?

1840
02:14:10,480 --> 02:14:11,760
I think I can get him.

1841
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:13,060
Where are they?

1842
02:14:13,480 --> 02:14:14,280
There's a guy.

1843
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:15,660
He's coming this way.

1844
02:14:21,080 --> 02:14:22,120
You lousy!

1845
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:25,480
You lousy!

1846
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:32,000
Don't notice me.

1847
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:33,320
Don't.

1848
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:34,280
Don't.

1849
02:14:34,280 --> 02:14:35,500
There we go.

1850
02:14:38,110 --> 02:14:38,950
My girl.

1851
02:14:40,030 --> 02:14:40,870
You lousy!

1852
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:51,560
I know there's...

1853
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:53,020
Oh I thought that was a guy.

1854
02:14:53,180 --> 02:14:53,920
Oh my gosh.

1855
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:55,860
I know there's stuff in there, but it's ok.

1856
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:00,900
Now here...

1857
02:15:00,900 --> 02:15:02,660
I can be a scientist, right?

1858
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:02,760
Alright.

1859
02:15:08,760 --> 02:15:09,420
Yes.

1860
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:14,720
Thank you.

1861
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:20,500
What if I want to be...

1862
02:15:20,500 --> 02:15:23,020
The zombie scientist, huh?

1863
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,140
Alright, here we go.

1864
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:29,920
All scientists are off-duty though.

1865
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:32,820
Let's see.

1866
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:35,740
I can save.

1867
02:15:41,410 --> 02:15:42,850
They might not know that.

1868
02:15:43,470 --> 02:15:44,210
They might forget.

1869
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:48,370
I'm gonna save to make sure.

1870
02:15:50,430 --> 02:15:51,070
Yay!

1871
02:15:54,640 --> 02:15:55,920
They might forget.

1872
02:15:58,020 --> 02:16:00,920
And if there's no scientist, even better for me.

1873
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:06,080
Zombies are not approved personnel.

1874
02:16:06,220 --> 02:16:06,780
Snope.

1875
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:09,460
Snope.

1876
02:16:14,410 --> 02:16:15,530
The blob.

1877
02:16:15,770 --> 02:16:17,050
That's what they call me at the club.

1878
02:16:33,150 --> 02:16:33,730
I know.

1879
02:16:39,050 --> 02:16:40,550
It's just like my video game.

1880
02:16:43,570 --> 02:16:44,150
Alright.

1881
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:47,150
If I die here because I'm a scientist...

1882
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:50,630
Scientists have rights!

1883
02:16:50,630 --> 02:16:53,290
Scientists have rights!

1884
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:06,280
There are scientists in there.

1885
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:11,040
Dang it.

1886
02:17:11,160 --> 02:17:12,780
How do I get in there again?

1887
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:14,160
Do I go around the other way?

1888
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,480
I'm also a scientist.

1889
02:17:23,960 --> 02:17:28,640
I would like to go down the science stairs as a scientist.

1890
02:17:29,220 --> 02:17:30,700
My hypothesis is...

1891
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:33,540
The steps are very narrow.

1892
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:47,220
If he was upstairs, I would have been able to CQC him and take him to the door.

1893
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:50,060
But unfortunately, we do not have that option.

1894
02:17:50,980 --> 02:17:51,940
So let's try...

1895
02:17:52,600 --> 02:17:54,360
Door number two!

1896
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:05,120
I am a scientist.

1897
02:18:06,200 --> 02:18:08,640
I'm doing my science things.

1898
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:16,920
Sneaking suit!

1899
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:24,440
It's the MGS3 sneaking suit!

1900
02:18:26,940 --> 02:18:30,200
It looks so good!

1901
02:18:30,680 --> 02:18:31,920
Oh my gosh.

1902
02:18:31,980 --> 02:18:34,960
Wait, where do I get the other one?

1903
02:18:35,020 --> 02:18:35,680
I can't remember.

1904
02:18:37,460 --> 02:18:39,960
I love the MGS3 sneaking suit.

1905
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:42,660
Because it looks so much like the boss.

1906
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:48,960
The latest battle uniform developed by the Soviet Union cuts all damage in half and reduces...

1907
02:18:49,780 --> 02:18:51,300
What button is that?

1908
02:18:58,020 --> 02:18:58,600
Reduces...

1909
02:18:58,600 --> 02:18:59,600
Circle?

1910
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:02,520
Stamina consumption!

1911
02:19:05,460 --> 02:19:06,820
Oh wait, R2.

1912
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:07,320
There we go.

1913
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:07,980
Yay!

1914
02:19:11,620 --> 02:19:12,180
Actually,

1915
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:19,020
where do I get the janitor outfit?

1916
02:19:19,340 --> 02:19:19,780
Let's see.

1917
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:22,320
It reduces...

1918
02:19:24,100 --> 02:19:25,760
Do people come in here?

1919
02:19:26,860 --> 02:19:27,180
No.

1920
02:19:27,620 --> 02:19:29,220
This is the scientist's room.

1921
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:31,500
This is only for me.

1922
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:39,640
I thought I just heard someone walking.

1923
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,480
Janitor!

1924
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:04,400
I'm a scientist trying to rob everybody in the office.

1925
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:07,040
Do not mind me.

1926
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,100
What is this?

1927
02:20:17,030 --> 02:20:17,470
Wow.

1928
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:19,230
Is that...

1929
02:20:19,230 --> 02:20:20,550
Is that one of the enders?

1930
02:20:22,370 --> 02:20:23,130
Did someone just come in?

1931
02:20:24,370 --> 02:20:26,010
He's coming this way!

1932
02:20:38,320 --> 02:20:39,380
Stop, stop, stop.

1933
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:41,280
I'm trying to do science.

1934
02:20:53,600 --> 02:20:54,480
Suppressor for the AR.

1935
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:55,500
Is that what I got?

1936
02:20:55,740 --> 02:20:57,180
I saw that I got a suppressor.

1937
02:21:00,730 --> 02:21:03,350
I'll be honest, I was half paying attention.

1938
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:04,970
There we go!

1939
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:08,670
Our janitor uniform.

1940
02:21:09,310 --> 02:21:09,650
Perfect.

1941
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:21,470
How is he just so handsome in everything he wears?

1942
02:21:22,750 --> 02:21:26,310
How are you actually a perfect being?

1943
02:21:26,310 --> 02:21:30,770
We got a second perfect being right there baby.

1944
02:21:37,220 --> 02:21:44,090
Now to maneuver through the hallway of lockers.

1945
02:21:44,170 --> 02:21:45,110
I think I got all of them.

1946
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:46,170
I think so.

1947
02:21:54,350 --> 02:21:55,510
We're ready.

1948
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:02,310
Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky...

1949
02:22:03,310 --> 02:22:04,630
Snake don't go in there yet.

1950
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:06,050
I got to change.

1951
02:22:31,030 --> 02:22:31,750
Yeah!

1952
02:22:34,230 --> 02:22:36,030
That guy is nuts.

1953
02:22:43,750 --> 02:22:45,270
Blow it up.

1954
02:22:46,070 --> 02:22:49,170
I don't want to think about it yet.

1955
02:22:49,950 --> 02:22:53,750
We have one thing at a time Major.

1956
02:23:07,210 --> 02:23:08,610
Yeah.

1957
02:23:10,690 --> 02:23:12,190
Without getting caught.

1958
02:23:15,070 --> 02:23:17,870
A key.

1959
02:23:22,330 --> 02:23:24,770
A key.

1960
02:23:29,690 --> 02:23:31,030
Good man.

1961
02:23:32,210 --> 02:23:33,410
Liquid?

1962
02:23:39,190 --> 02:23:42,830
I will go down with this ship.

1963
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:02,210
Okay.

1964
02:24:06,990 --> 02:24:07,270
Okay.

1965
02:24:09,270 --> 02:24:11,790
Not looking forward to Voldemort.

1966
02:24:13,610 --> 02:24:16,850
I got to do this part right first though.

1967
02:24:20,470 --> 02:24:21,750
One moment.

1968
02:24:22,610 --> 02:24:23,610
Wait, hold on.

1969
02:24:24,130 --> 02:24:24,650
Let me save.

1970
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:27,590
Yeah!

1971
02:24:32,370 --> 02:24:34,510
We just have a little bit left to go though.

1972
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:37,590
As long as I'm good at the game.

1973
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:40,310
You'll be fine.

1974
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:41,130
You're going to crush Vulcan.

1975
02:24:41,190 --> 02:24:41,650
Easy, easy.

1976
02:24:41,850 --> 02:24:42,330
I don't know.

1977
02:24:42,470 --> 02:24:44,730
I feel like I... I don't think I struggled...

1978
02:24:44,730 --> 02:24:47,770
I don't remember struggling with him as much as I did with...

1979
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:52,490
Such as like the Fury, but I remember the Shagohad gave me some issues.

1980
02:24:57,870 --> 02:24:59,650
Snake hasn't seen anything.

1981
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:05,570
Not going to skin if you want to do lethal.

1982
02:25:06,290 --> 02:25:06,670
We'll do lethal.

1983
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:13,850
I'm not aiming for any specific ranks or anything though.

1984
02:25:18,230 --> 02:25:19,270
I'm just having fun.

1985
02:25:24,770 --> 02:25:25,370
Oh!

1986
02:25:30,490 --> 02:25:31,690
A date?

1987
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:42,270
Did you get Vulcan's camo is crazy powerful for the bike escape?

1988
02:25:42,530 --> 02:25:42,930
Really?

1989
02:25:43,830 --> 02:25:45,930
I think the bike escape is not so bad though.

1990
02:25:45,930 --> 02:25:46,090
Hi.

1991
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:53,650
What's the 7th fleet?

1992
02:25:54,270 --> 02:25:55,370
Does that mean he's dead?

1993
02:25:56,950 --> 02:25:58,010
Is he gone?

1994
02:25:58,810 --> 02:25:59,690
What does that mean?

1995
02:26:05,970 --> 02:26:07,070
It's the one after 6.

1996
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:12,370
Maintenance here.

1997
02:26:15,710 --> 02:26:17,710
Nobody noticed me.

1998
02:26:19,070 --> 02:26:21,450
With my maintenance uniform.

1999
02:26:22,010 --> 02:26:23,670
I know there's a guy up here.

2000
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:25,650
Yeah, I remember him.

2001
02:26:39,950 --> 02:26:42,310
These guys have eagle eyes though.

2002
02:26:42,390 --> 02:26:43,350
These guys are kind of crazy.

2003
02:26:54,990 --> 02:26:56,150
Nice butt.

2004
02:27:05,720 --> 02:27:07,000
The definition.

2005
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:13,820
It's really...

2006
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,260
It's really prominent, isn't it?

2007
02:27:20,160 --> 02:27:21,580
Alrighty, let's find...

2008
02:27:21,580 --> 02:27:24,400
I remember... Let's see.

2009
02:27:26,140 --> 02:27:27,060
Can these guys see me?

2010
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,020
Will they recognize me?

2011
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:28,580
I can't remember.

2012
02:27:29,180 --> 02:27:30,460
We'll find out right now.

2013
02:27:31,820 --> 02:27:34,100
I know those guys can.

2014
02:27:35,000 --> 02:27:36,360
So there's one right here.

2015
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:38,620
There's one down there, I believe.

2016
02:27:38,620 --> 02:27:44,340
If I... Oh, I was going to take him out.

2017
02:27:51,220 --> 02:27:52,600
There's one right here, yeah.

2018
02:28:13,940 --> 02:28:14,960
Where's my C3?

2019
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:23,660
Would it be under the other one?

2020
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:24,860
Under weapon?

2021
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:28,340
C3...

2022
02:28:32,860 --> 02:28:33,220
C3...

2023
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:38,720
And... Dang it.

2024
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:40,480
Magazine.

2025
02:28:40,700 --> 02:28:41,380
No, not magazine.

2026
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:43,100
Oh my gosh, I was thinking of the book.

2027
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:45,320
Like an actual magazine, you know?

2028
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:46,480
Eat the C3.

2029
02:28:46,780 --> 02:28:47,280
Oh here we go.

2030
02:28:47,660 --> 02:28:48,000
Book.

2031
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:51,620
I think this might be helpful for some of the guards.

2032
02:28:52,580 --> 02:28:52,960
Yeah.

2033
02:29:03,740 --> 02:29:04,120
C3.

2034
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:04,340
OK.

2035
02:29:06,320 --> 02:29:06,700
Press...

2036
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:07,240
Square.

2037
02:29:07,760 --> 02:29:08,720
Can I put it here?

2038
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:10,320
Or do I have to put it...

2039
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:10,680
Oh gosh.

2040
02:29:11,140 --> 02:29:11,440
Get up.

2041
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:14,200
I don't remember where I have to put it.

2042
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:14,560
Like here?

2043
02:29:19,040 --> 02:29:19,780
Does that work?

2044
02:29:21,460 --> 02:29:22,580
How many do I have?

2045
02:29:22,640 --> 02:29:22,920
Three.

2046
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:25,920
That works.

2047
02:29:26,420 --> 02:29:26,800
Right?

2048
02:29:28,760 --> 02:29:30,580
That one guy.

2049
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:33,360
He'll be fine.

2050
02:29:35,380 --> 02:29:36,340
He'll be OK.

2051
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:47,460
I'm looking.

2052
02:29:49,820 --> 02:29:52,260
I'm doing... not C3 things.

2053
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:58,650
Yeah.

2054
02:30:01,050 --> 02:30:02,130
Yeah.

2055
02:30:02,490 --> 02:30:02,710
Eva.

2056
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:05,830
Yippee.

2057
02:30:08,010 --> 02:30:08,330
Good.

2058
02:30:10,310 --> 02:30:10,610
Yeah.

2059
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:14,610
Yeah.

2060
02:30:18,230 --> 02:30:18,430
OK.

2061
02:30:23,370 --> 02:30:25,790
Totally not planting...

2062
02:30:25,790 --> 02:30:26,950
C3.

2063
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:27,950
Not at all.

2064
02:30:28,510 --> 02:30:28,970
Not at all.

2065
02:30:29,030 --> 02:30:29,390
Not at all.

2066
02:30:29,430 --> 02:30:29,890
Not at all.

2067
02:30:30,890 --> 02:30:33,350
Never done that in my life.

2068
02:30:34,090 --> 02:30:34,870
I

2069
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:42,160
don't want this guy to see me.

2070
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:44,280
Don't see me.

2071
02:30:44,980 --> 02:30:45,400
Sir?

2072
02:30:49,420 --> 02:30:49,860
OK.

2073
02:30:50,140 --> 02:30:50,600
C3.

2074
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:56,580
Oh shoot.

2075
02:30:57,140 --> 02:30:57,560
What?

2076
02:30:57,560 --> 02:30:58,280
Ah!

2077
02:31:03,080 --> 02:31:06,000
I'm telling you they have eagle eyes!

2078
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:09,580
Oh my gosh!

2079
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:11,420
No!

2080
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:15,620
We were so close.

2081
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,800
Eagle eyes!

2082
02:31:22,200 --> 02:31:23,740
I'm telling you that's some crazy picture.

2083
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:24,500
I know!

2084
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:26,620
That's what I mean!

2085
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:31,080
OK.

2086
02:31:31,400 --> 02:31:31,660
OK.

2087
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:32,160
OK.

2088
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:32,560
OK.

2089
02:31:32,820 --> 02:31:35,240
Now I have to put all my stuff back.

2090
02:31:36,380 --> 02:31:37,660
I can't let go of you.

2091
02:31:38,840 --> 02:31:39,200
Come.

2092
02:31:43,100 --> 02:31:43,620
C3.

2093
02:31:44,600 --> 02:31:45,120
Look.

2094
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:49,020
This is what it looks like.

2095
02:31:52,400 --> 02:31:54,420
I have not seen that happen before.

2096
02:31:54,500 --> 02:31:55,100
That was really funny.

2097
02:31:57,160 --> 02:32:01,100
I'm glad that I could fulfill that...

2098
02:32:02,900 --> 02:32:05,560
That new experience for you.

2099
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:13,100
Let's get rid of this guy because I'm afraid of him being able to...

2100
02:32:16,240 --> 02:32:17,960
Also eagle eye me and all.

2101
02:32:33,910 --> 02:32:35,330
I'm going to...

2102
02:32:38,510 --> 02:32:40,230
I'm going to get this guy.

2103
02:32:41,090 --> 02:32:41,590
Oh wait.

2104
02:32:43,170 --> 02:32:43,810
I should be OK.

2105
02:32:44,710 --> 02:32:45,070
Oh whoops.

2106
02:32:45,190 --> 02:32:45,550
No, no, no.

2107
02:32:45,770 --> 02:32:46,410
That's not...

2108
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:47,030
No, no, no.

2109
02:32:47,730 --> 02:32:48,150
Nashi!

2110
02:32:49,210 --> 02:32:50,070
Thanks for the 10 gifts!

2111
02:32:50,390 --> 02:32:51,590
Thank you so much!

2112
02:32:51,710 --> 02:32:53,310
Oh my gosh, I keep pressing X.

2113
02:32:55,670 --> 02:32:56,990
Let's just... What's good?

2114
02:32:57,350 --> 02:32:58,770
Olive Drab is really good.

2115
02:32:59,370 --> 02:33:00,010
Is that the best?

2116
02:33:01,870 --> 02:33:02,690
It's the best.

2117
02:33:03,670 --> 02:33:05,070
My Olive Drab.

2118
02:33:06,730 --> 02:33:08,170
And of course Splitter.

2119
02:33:08,310 --> 02:33:08,770
My favorite.

2120
02:33:12,130 --> 02:33:12,530
OK.

2121
02:33:12,530 --> 02:33:14,830
Now, let's take out this guy.

2122
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:19,510
By take out I mean put him to sleep.

2123
02:33:20,150 --> 02:33:21,010
Good night little baby.

2124
02:33:21,830 --> 02:33:22,230
OK.

2125
02:33:22,710 --> 02:33:23,990
Fast, fast, fast, fast.

2126
02:33:24,350 --> 02:33:26,890
OK, I have to be really fast because this guy is going to notice me, isn't he?

2127
02:33:27,130 --> 02:33:27,530
Shoot!

2128
02:33:27,750 --> 02:33:28,870
I thought he was going to be...

2129
02:33:28,870 --> 02:33:29,890
OK, OK, OK.

2130
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:33,730
Oh gosh.

2131
02:33:34,510 --> 02:33:36,170
Look at the way Naked Snake just stands there.

2132
02:33:36,270 --> 02:33:37,710
Look at that stance.

2133
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:49,820
He didn't notice.

2134
02:33:49,940 --> 02:33:50,460
He didn't notice.

2135
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:00,460
Good night little baby.

2136
02:34:02,140 --> 02:34:03,840
Good night little baby.

2137
02:34:04,540 --> 02:34:05,400
Nobody noticed.

2138
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:06,700
Good.

2139
02:34:15,870 --> 02:34:16,050
Notice?

2140
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:17,050
No, I don't think so.

2141
02:34:23,030 --> 02:34:24,250
OK, I'm going to skip you Eva.

2142
02:34:24,430 --> 02:34:24,610
Sorry.

2143
02:34:24,610 --> 02:34:26,350
Don't have time.

2144
02:34:33,550 --> 02:34:36,010
Yeah, he's overworked.

2145
02:34:36,150 --> 02:34:37,910
Always working so hard.

2146
02:34:38,770 --> 02:34:42,290
It's really difficult being a guy here.

2147
02:34:45,110 --> 02:34:45,730
You know?

2148
02:34:46,770 --> 02:34:48,890
It's really difficult being...

2149
02:34:48,890 --> 02:34:50,490
Oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh, oh gosh.

2150
02:34:53,570 --> 02:34:54,670
Run away!

2151
02:34:57,710 --> 02:34:58,530
Run away!

2152
02:35:00,210 --> 02:35:00,510
OK.

2153
02:35:01,570 --> 02:35:03,950
Snake, I need you to go a little faster up this hill, OK?

2154
02:35:04,030 --> 02:35:04,390
Thank you.

2155
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:08,770
Alright, eagle eyes over here.

2156
02:35:09,590 --> 02:35:10,670
Oh no, no, no, no.

2157
02:35:17,440 --> 02:35:19,480
Where is our little eagle eyed pal?

2158
02:35:19,560 --> 02:35:20,220
There he is.

2159
02:35:20,600 --> 02:35:21,600
I'm going to take you out.

2160
02:35:21,900 --> 02:35:24,920
I really honestly want to just kill him, but...

2161
02:35:25,560 --> 02:35:26,840
I won't do that.

2162
02:35:27,600 --> 02:35:29,120
I won't do that to you.

2163
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:30,680
Don't worry.

2164
02:35:30,680 --> 02:35:34,520
I'll make you go out nice and easy.

2165
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:36,900
Use the trank.

2166
02:35:38,100 --> 02:35:43,660
Yeah, unfortunately I'm going to tranquilize them instead of killing them.

2167
02:35:45,420 --> 02:35:47,460
Can I even get this guy from down here?

2168
02:35:48,360 --> 02:35:48,800
Oh gosh.

2169
02:35:49,240 --> 02:35:49,860
Wait, where is he?

2170
02:35:52,480 --> 02:35:53,760
Stop moving!

2171
02:36:11,460 --> 02:36:13,340
I've got my cigarette spray.

2172
02:36:14,120 --> 02:36:18,260
I'm ready for a day, so I gotta run.

2173
02:36:18,860 --> 02:36:19,060
OK.

2174
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:21,480
Still at the 3 Z's.

2175
02:36:24,720 --> 02:36:28,960
The fact that you can hear the bombs is kind of diabolical.

2176
02:36:29,960 --> 02:36:33,780
Nobody notice the ominous beeping sound.

2177
02:36:34,580 --> 02:36:35,720
Nobody notice, OK?

2178
02:36:36,860 --> 02:36:37,800
Good, good.

2179
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:42,640
Nobody notice the ominous beeping.

2180
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:48,780
Nobody notice the ominous beeping sound.

2181
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:51,320
OK, we have that guy put to sleep.

2182
02:36:51,560 --> 02:36:52,320
We are good to go.

2183
02:36:53,300 --> 02:36:54,060
Here we go.

2184
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:04,520
You need to change the battery in your fire alarm.

2185
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:08,860
Oh, that's not a very long timer, Snake.

2186
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:10,580
Oh my gosh.

2187
02:37:11,060 --> 02:37:12,020
Screw this heart.

2188
02:37:14,680 --> 02:37:16,800
Yeah, he's something else.

2189
02:37:16,900 --> 02:37:20,540
This guy is just like, sorry Eva and your feelings.

2190
02:37:27,420 --> 02:37:28,100
Symbolism.

2191
02:37:28,100 --> 02:37:28,700
Symbolism.

2192
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:33,620
This is so awesome.

2193
02:37:44,780 --> 02:37:46,180
Slam!

2194
02:37:48,960 --> 02:37:49,660
Nice.

2195
02:37:50,320 --> 02:37:51,740
OK, let's go.

2196
02:37:58,100 --> 02:38:00,480
Major, I finished planting the C3.

2197
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:02,140
I'm on my way out now.

2198
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:03,880
Yes.

2199
02:38:07,700 --> 02:38:09,160
I hope so.

2200
02:38:16,780 --> 02:38:18,740
I love this man.

2201
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:19,380
Me too.

2202
02:38:19,480 --> 02:38:20,820
He's such a goofy guy.

2203
02:38:25,380 --> 02:38:26,740
Oh no!

2204
02:38:27,380 --> 02:38:28,060
Eva!

2205
02:38:39,940 --> 02:38:40,660
Buzz!

2206
02:38:46,700 --> 02:38:47,960
Look at him.

2207
02:38:48,120 --> 02:38:49,640
He's like, I'll fight you.

2208
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:53,200
In my maintenance uniform.

2209
02:38:54,260 --> 02:38:55,480
I'm the janitor!

2210
02:39:02,560 --> 02:39:03,640
Fancy kicking.

2211
02:39:04,920 --> 02:39:08,360
I should have changed before we did this.

2212
02:39:11,940 --> 02:39:13,440
I'm the janitor!

2213
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:18,340
It's time to take out the trash.

2214
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:21,340
That's a lot.

2215
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:22,960
He wouldn't.

2216
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:29,260
Yes please.

2217
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:29,520
Please.

2218
02:39:33,260 --> 02:39:34,780
I'm the janitor.

2219
02:39:36,320 --> 02:39:37,560
Garbage day.

2220
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:45,160
Alright, 13 minutes guys.

2221
02:39:46,120 --> 02:39:48,140
Before this place explodes.

2222
02:39:48,520 --> 02:39:54,420
And then it's going to be less than that because Volgin is going to talk his whole mouth off.

2223
02:40:01,490 --> 02:40:02,550
Look at that.

2224
02:40:02,630 --> 02:40:06,210
The snake is too cool looking.

2225
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:15,350
She doesn't have it, does she?

2226
02:40:15,370 --> 02:40:17,570
The Philosopher's Legacy!

2227
02:40:18,570 --> 02:40:20,690
The Philosopher's Legacy.

2228
02:40:26,950 --> 02:40:29,270
I know.

2229
02:40:29,870 --> 02:40:31,190
You're stressing me out, Sorrow.

2230
02:40:33,390 --> 02:40:36,070
You are stressing me out.

2231
02:40:39,890 --> 02:40:42,210
The smell.

2232
02:40:44,530 --> 02:40:46,250
The gasoline.

2233
02:40:47,570 --> 02:40:49,730
It was gasoline.

2234
02:40:50,690 --> 02:40:52,230
Motorcycle gasoline.

2235
02:40:53,530 --> 02:40:54,910
She reeked of it.

2236
02:40:55,210 --> 02:40:56,650
Yeah, I believe that.

2237
02:40:59,390 --> 02:41:00,610
Aw, lovely.

2238
02:41:04,470 --> 02:41:05,450
Oh gosh.

2239
02:41:05,810 --> 02:41:06,090
Yeah.

2240
02:41:10,290 --> 02:41:11,110
Stinky.

2241
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:15,950
I think he liked her.

2242
02:41:17,570 --> 02:41:19,650
Aw, headbutt.

2243
02:41:22,070 --> 02:41:22,290
No!

2244
02:41:26,140 --> 02:41:28,040
She's very fine.

2245
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:31,540
At least she was lovely and stinky.

2246
02:41:35,120 --> 02:41:36,180
Obedient.

2247
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:42,680
Oh my gosh.

2248
02:41:49,420 --> 02:41:51,140
I like how they don't subtitle that.

2249
02:41:54,620 --> 02:41:56,380
The kiss of death.

2250
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:57,580
Kiss of death!

2251
02:42:00,200 --> 02:42:00,860
Dang it.

2252
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:02,640
Eva, you had one job.

2253
02:42:04,860 --> 02:42:07,260
Remember when I said that in a goofy detective drama?

2254
02:42:08,260 --> 02:42:09,920
You dirty whore.

2255
02:42:10,320 --> 02:42:13,580
I've had enough kisses from you.

2256
02:42:16,920 --> 02:42:19,240
I can't get over that.

2257
02:42:21,420 --> 02:42:24,140
I've had enough kisses from you.

2258
02:42:24,420 --> 02:42:27,220
Sokolov wasn't man enough to have a lover like that.

2259
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:33,600
Just like the KGB to send something so beautiful, yet so deadly.

2260
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:35,840
What is the Philosopher's Legacy?

2261
02:42:38,680 --> 02:42:39,980
He explained it!

2262
02:42:40,580 --> 02:42:42,540
He explained it during the Torture Snake.

2263
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:44,740
Weren't you paying attention while he was like...

2264
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:45,940
while you were on the brink of death?

2265
02:42:46,880 --> 02:42:47,480
Come on!

2266
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:51,840
Hey Lord Dom!

2267
02:42:55,200 --> 02:43:00,140
He was too busy suffering.

2268
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:01,800
Oh come on.

2269
02:43:07,260 --> 02:43:07,720
Oh.

2270
02:43:12,160 --> 02:43:12,860
Research.

2271
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:21,000
Money,

2272
02:43:24,740 --> 02:43:25,960
money baby.

2273
02:43:28,860 --> 02:43:31,120
Real footage.

2274
02:43:46,860 --> 02:43:47,840
Oh.

2275
02:43:50,140 --> 02:43:53,620
Who the hell is that guy?

2276
02:43:55,780 --> 02:43:56,980
His face!

2277
02:43:57,980 --> 02:43:59,320
He just looked like a balloon.

2278
02:44:02,760 --> 02:44:04,620
Skull face real.

2279
02:44:04,920 --> 02:44:06,500
Actually though, right?

2280
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:11,120
My father was one of the men in charge of managing the Philosopher's Legacy.

2281
02:44:12,120 --> 02:44:20,480
In the confusion that ensued after the war ended, he devised a series of ingenious plots to ensure that the Soviet Union would have total control over the legacy.

2282
02:44:21,900 --> 02:44:26,140
The money was divided up and laundered through banks all over the world.

2283
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:31,260
Switzerland, Australia, and Hong Kong.

2284
02:44:33,480 --> 02:44:36,520
This microfilm contains a record of all those transactions.

2285
02:44:36,520 --> 02:44:38,180
Is that Vulcan's dad or Vulcan?

2286
02:44:38,540 --> 02:44:40,520
He looks like such a chad.

2287
02:44:41,240 --> 02:44:45,560
After my father's death, I learned of this secret and obtained the microfilm.

2288
02:44:46,280 --> 02:44:47,300
This is his dad.

2289
02:44:47,400 --> 02:44:47,500
Ok.

2290
02:44:47,820 --> 02:44:55,200
With this money and the support of Brezhnev and his allies, I built this fortress of Groznygrad and Grannon's research facility.

2291
02:44:57,260 --> 02:45:01,540
But that worthless fool Grannon failed to produce results.

2292
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:07,560
I was forced to turn to Khrushchev's dog Sokolov and his invention, the Shagohog.

2293
02:45:07,680 --> 02:45:09,620
Khrushchev was just...he wasn't ready.

2294
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:11,560
He was working on it.

2295
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:16,420
My position in GRU made it too troublesome to attack Sokolov's facility directly.

2296
02:45:17,240 --> 02:45:22,300
But the spy network established by the secret pact still existed.

2297
02:45:22,880 --> 02:45:26,340
I used it to contact the boss and suggested that she defect.

2298
02:45:27,880 --> 02:45:31,820
The boss was conniving enough to see things my way.

2299
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:39,340
The world was once one, but the conflict between the philosophers has torn it in two.

2300
02:45:41,320 --> 02:45:46,400
We will use the legacy to heal that rift and make the world whole again.

2301
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:50,260
To do this we need strength.

2302
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:54,360
An unstoppable trump card with enough power to bring order to the world.

2303
02:45:54,440 --> 02:45:56,340
The skeleton face behind them is so scary.

2304
02:45:56,560 --> 02:46:00,360
That trump card was to be the Shagohog and the Cobra unit.

2305
02:46:00,980 --> 02:46:01,820
Is that the sorrow?

2306
02:46:04,920 --> 02:46:06,180
You guys see it?

2307
02:46:06,260 --> 02:46:06,720
Creepy.

2308
02:46:11,360 --> 02:46:13,720
I wonder what these pictures will look like in Delta.

2309
02:46:14,920 --> 02:46:17,800
Like if they'll have the Shagohog or what.

2310
02:46:28,320 --> 02:46:30,180
Ooh, trust in her.

2311
02:46:30,340 --> 02:46:30,520
Okay.

2312
02:46:38,160 --> 02:46:39,780
She's like, bitch!

2313
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:42,240
Give me the legacy!

2314
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:49,540
I like just listening to her squeaky clothes.

2315
02:46:49,900 --> 02:46:54,000
It's kind of like... it's like an ASMR.

2316
02:46:59,540 --> 02:47:01,420
She saw right through me.

2317
02:47:10,180 --> 02:47:12,300
Yeah, do that.

2318
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:16,760
Leave everything to me.

2319
02:47:17,560 --> 02:47:19,400
Okay, don't talk too loud boss.

2320
02:47:19,540 --> 02:47:20,920
Okay, I think he can still hear.

2321
02:47:24,040 --> 02:47:25,440
SpongeBob, that is Pearl.

2322
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:27,640
That is Pearl.

2323
02:47:27,960 --> 02:47:29,220
Oh my gosh, it's so weird.

2324
02:47:35,200 --> 02:47:37,380
Fight like a warrior, Volgin.

2325
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:43,500
Oh gosh, I'm nervous.

2326
02:47:47,240 --> 02:47:49,060
Sorry for the look on his face.

2327
02:47:50,860 --> 02:47:52,220
Ocelot, you little freak.

2328
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:59,620
He said this like 3 times now.

2329
02:48:04,640 --> 02:48:07,540
Volgin is like, stop with your clown shows.

2330
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:16,660
What do you mean judo?

2331
02:48:17,100 --> 02:48:18,240
It's CQC.

2332
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:22,020
I've been waiting for this moment.

2333
02:48:22,440 --> 02:48:23,220
Times 3.

2334
02:48:26,240 --> 02:48:28,940
Volgin standing man emoji in the background.

2335
02:48:30,080 --> 02:48:31,160
Hurry up!

2336
02:48:38,280 --> 02:48:39,660
Oh boy.

2337
02:48:40,800 --> 02:48:42,020
The socks are off.

2338
02:48:42,500 --> 02:48:42,960
Gosh.

2339
02:48:49,720 --> 02:48:50,080
Silence!

2340
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:57,360
Look at his mannerisms, this theater kid.

2341
02:49:06,260 --> 02:49:09,980
Now that I've told you everything you need to know to win the game, time to go.

2342
02:49:09,980 --> 02:49:10,140
Oh.

2343
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:22,200
Shut up Nano, I don't want to hear this.

2344
02:49:22,720 --> 02:49:24,660
Every hotel got the Ocelot chair.

2345
02:49:25,520 --> 02:49:27,120
We only got 7 minutes you guys.

2346
02:49:27,340 --> 02:49:28,060
I think we are in trouble.

2347
02:49:32,680 --> 02:49:33,780
Kept you waiting, huh?

2348
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:38,900
Guys, I'm nervous.

2349
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:40,220
Ah!

2350
02:49:46,480 --> 02:49:48,600
I'm nervous, I don't remember the strategy.

2351
02:49:48,960 --> 02:49:50,460
Oh gosh, ok.

2352
02:49:50,900 --> 02:49:52,380
We'll just figure it out as we go.

2353
02:49:54,920 --> 02:49:56,980
What is the hotel chair?

2354
02:49:58,180 --> 02:49:59,340
I've seen that before.

2355
02:50:01,160 --> 02:50:02,740
What's the hotel chair?

2356
02:50:04,600 --> 02:50:05,160
Win.

2357
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:24,260
Oh my god, my ears though, please.

2358
02:50:28,640 --> 02:50:31,500
The chair you sit in while watching your wife get...

2359
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:39,220
Ok, thank you Sorrow.

2360
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:42,580
Snake!

2361
02:50:48,270 --> 02:50:49,290
The music.

2362
02:50:53,950 --> 02:50:54,210
Ah!

2363
02:50:58,170 --> 02:50:59,450
Nice catch.

2364
02:51:05,490 --> 02:51:08,870
He says so much in so little words.

2365
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:11,950
He says everything in just actions.

2366
02:51:13,470 --> 02:51:14,930
Alright, time to switch clothes.

2367
02:51:15,030 --> 02:51:16,250
I'm done being a janitor.

2368
02:51:31,630 --> 02:51:32,450
Start.

2369
02:51:34,770 --> 02:51:36,150
Let's see, ok.

2370
02:51:38,310 --> 02:51:39,770
Snaking suit.

2371
02:51:44,430 --> 02:51:45,450
Let's see.

2372
02:51:46,890 --> 02:51:47,970
Let's call people.

2373
02:51:49,750 --> 02:51:51,450
Where did he put his knife?

2374
02:51:51,450 --> 02:51:56,030
He has a little sheath on his chest.

2375
02:51:58,030 --> 02:51:59,470
Zero, help me please.

2376
02:52:02,510 --> 02:52:04,310
Oh ok, I was just going to run into them.

2377
02:52:09,370 --> 02:52:09,810
Ok.

2378
02:52:19,770 --> 02:52:20,210
CQC!

2379
02:52:23,190 --> 02:52:24,090
Yeah, I know.

2380
02:52:28,390 --> 02:52:29,110
Ok.

2381
02:52:31,050 --> 02:52:33,410
What about Sigint, what do you have to say?

2382
02:52:48,830 --> 02:52:50,270
CQC, CQC.

2383
02:52:59,470 --> 02:53:01,770
So don't say CQC.

2384
02:53:07,190 --> 02:53:08,070
Ok!

2385
02:53:08,070 --> 02:53:09,390
I'll just...

2386
02:53:13,210 --> 02:53:14,750
Bullets aren't magnetic.

2387
02:53:14,890 --> 02:53:16,730
Electromagnetic fields wouldn't do anything to...

2388
02:53:22,650 --> 02:53:23,530
Just...

2389
02:53:25,150 --> 02:53:25,910
It's...

2390
02:53:27,830 --> 02:53:30,190
It's Metal Gear, ok.

2391
02:53:31,750 --> 02:53:33,870
Just let it happen.

2392
02:53:41,150 --> 02:53:43,750
Hold on, I also want to get...

2393
02:53:44,550 --> 02:53:45,890
Maybe a big gun.

2394
02:53:47,190 --> 02:53:48,570
In my arsenal.

2395
02:53:49,090 --> 02:53:49,490
Oh wait!

2396
02:53:49,870 --> 02:53:52,630
Or should I try and do the suppressor?

2397
02:53:52,630 --> 02:53:53,450
But...

2398
02:53:56,050 --> 02:54:01,610
CQC will do his stamina, not his...

2399
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:08,340
His actual health, right?

2400
02:54:10,160 --> 02:54:11,820
CQC will stamina drain him.

2401
02:54:11,900 --> 02:54:12,360
Yeah, ok.

2402
02:54:12,840 --> 02:54:15,000
So maybe we'll have enough bullets.

2403
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:15,860
I won't need it.

2404
02:54:16,060 --> 02:54:19,400
After this, I don't really need it.

2405
02:54:20,140 --> 02:54:21,620
I don't really need it.

2406
02:54:23,260 --> 02:54:25,460
Even probably for one more battle.

2407
02:54:25,960 --> 02:54:28,700
If I had to do one more battle, we don't know yet.

2408
02:54:28,920 --> 02:54:30,980
If I had to fight anybody else...

2409
02:54:30,980 --> 02:54:33,360
I mean, we kind of know that we have to fight the boss.

2410
02:54:33,740 --> 02:54:36,100
But, if I...

2411
02:54:38,100 --> 02:54:38,560
Ok.

2412
02:54:39,560 --> 02:54:39,880
Alright.

2413
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:42,440
Alright, cool.

2414
02:54:43,900 --> 02:54:47,600
Let me take off my suppressor.

2415
02:54:47,600 --> 02:54:48,940
Well, I don't really need it anyway.

2416
02:54:49,160 --> 02:54:50,020
After this, anyway.

2417
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:51,700
But, whatever, whatever, whatever.

2418
02:55:03,280 --> 02:55:06,000
Oh yeah, that's right.

2419
02:55:06,040 --> 02:55:07,580
He kills the animals and stuff.

2420
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:09,000
Can I fight you?

2421
02:55:09,100 --> 02:55:09,720
Can I hit you?

2422
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:10,660
I don't know.

2423
02:55:10,740 --> 02:55:12,540
Sorry guys, this might take a couple tries.

2424
02:55:13,760 --> 02:55:15,440
We'll see how long it takes me, really.

2425
02:55:45,030 --> 02:55:46,330
I'm trying to get to his back.

2426
02:55:47,050 --> 02:55:48,130
He turned around so fast.

2427
02:55:48,130 --> 02:55:50,130
I'm trying to get to his back, but he turned around.

2428
02:56:00,790 --> 02:56:01,810
Try the slam.

2429
02:56:03,730 --> 02:56:03,850
Oh

2430
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:09,440
my...

2431
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:21,510
Dude, no way.

2432
02:56:22,690 --> 02:56:25,090
Slamming, slamming, slamming, slamming, slam.

2433
02:56:25,630 --> 02:56:26,170
Ouchie, ouchie.

2434
02:56:34,720 --> 02:56:36,640
Oh wait, can I...

2435
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:39,640
No, this is going to explode my bullets.

2436
02:56:57,660 --> 02:56:58,600
Can I shoot him?

2437
02:56:58,760 --> 02:57:00,140
No, I wonder.

2438
02:57:00,140 --> 02:57:01,400
Oh my gosh.

2439
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:03,460
Well, not now, I guess.

2440
02:57:04,440 --> 02:57:06,260
Oh my god, oh my god.

2441
02:57:09,060 --> 02:57:09,640
Okay.

2442
02:57:13,280 --> 02:57:14,860
I'm gonna try...

2443
02:57:15,460 --> 02:57:17,340
Oh my god.

2444
02:57:20,360 --> 02:57:21,560
Oh, shoot.

2445
02:57:22,820 --> 02:57:24,040
Put away your gun.

2446
02:57:25,980 --> 02:57:27,180
Put away your gun.

2447
02:57:27,640 --> 02:57:30,720
It's the 14th in EU time zones, which means I'm officially a hag now.

2448
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:32,020
How do I deal with being in demand?

2449
02:57:32,140 --> 02:57:33,840
Vtuber fans keep sliding in my DMs.

2450
02:57:33,880 --> 02:57:35,420
Please help me, Ms. Boomer.

2451
02:57:35,980 --> 02:57:36,600
Chovek!

2452
02:57:37,260 --> 02:57:38,100
Happy birthday!

2453
02:57:40,780 --> 02:57:42,660
Happy in my foot!

2454
02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:46,440
Birthday to you.

2455
02:57:47,480 --> 02:57:51,140
Happy birthday to you.

2456
02:57:52,300 --> 02:57:56,940
Happy birthday dear Chovek.

2457
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:58,200
You're a hag now.

2458
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:02,880
Happy birthday to you.

2459
02:58:03,860 --> 02:58:05,740
Wait, what's a male hag?

2460
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:11,480
You're a bag now.

2461
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:14,380
You're...

2462
02:58:14,760 --> 02:58:16,580
A hog?

2463
02:58:22,060 --> 02:58:26,100
I'm not gonna beat him this time, I don't think guys, because...

2464
02:58:27,720 --> 02:58:28,540
Oh my god.

2465
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:29,920
Ah, shoot.

2466
02:58:31,280 --> 02:58:31,840
This

2467
02:58:39,740 --> 02:58:40,940
attack so much.

2468
02:58:56,060 --> 02:58:57,620
Come on, I'm trying.

2469
02:58:58,680 --> 02:58:59,780
Oh my gosh.

2470
02:59:01,120 --> 02:59:03,040
I can't avoid bullets ever.

2471
02:59:03,400 --> 02:59:04,660
It's just in my nature.

2472
02:59:05,240 --> 02:59:06,220
Why always in the foot?

2473
02:59:07,100 --> 02:59:08,380
He's such a freak.

2474
02:59:10,140 --> 02:59:12,180
He's just a freak, he's just a freak.

2475
02:59:12,600 --> 02:59:13,500
They're all just freaks.

2476
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:14,820
They're all just freaks.

2477
02:59:16,260 --> 02:59:17,460
Two minutes left.

2478
02:59:17,500 --> 02:59:17,960
Yeah, I know.

2479
02:59:18,040 --> 02:59:19,220
It's OK, we're not gonna get him this time.

2480
02:59:23,230 --> 02:59:24,550
It's OK, we're not gonna get him this time.

2481
02:59:24,970 --> 02:59:25,710
If I don't get him.

2482
02:59:26,650 --> 02:59:27,690
Am I out of bullets?

2483
02:59:38,980 --> 02:59:40,940
I mean, I just gotta move.

2484
02:59:41,180 --> 02:59:42,240
Wait, did I cure it?

2485
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:42,980
No.

2486
02:59:43,480 --> 02:59:44,260
What did I miss?

2487
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:46,080
What do you mean?

2488
02:59:47,500 --> 02:59:47,880
Not yet.

2489
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:48,460
Oh, disinfect.

2490
02:59:48,460 --> 02:59:48,500
Disinfect.

2491
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:02,840
I can't CQC him in this mode though, or can I?

2492
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:07,420
I'll try when he's not so... When he's not in the green glow, you know.

2493
03:00:08,020 --> 03:00:08,980
Unless I can do it here.

2494
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:12,760
Yeah, OK.

2495
03:00:32,470 --> 03:00:35,190
Use Mosin if you are out of unlethal gun.

2496
03:00:36,670 --> 03:00:38,070
But it's like...

2497
03:00:40,450 --> 03:00:42,970
It's so hard to shoot with it though.

2498
03:00:44,410 --> 03:00:45,750
I have a broken bone?

2499
03:00:46,030 --> 03:00:46,930
Since when?

2500
03:00:50,170 --> 03:00:51,590
What else do I need?

2501
03:00:51,710 --> 03:00:52,270
Oh, bandage.

2502
03:00:54,190 --> 03:00:54,930
Easy peasy.

2503
03:00:54,930 --> 03:00:56,390
Yesterday was my bday.

2504
03:00:56,510 --> 03:00:57,570
I'm already a male hag.

2505
03:00:57,710 --> 03:00:59,930
Just a hag older.

2506
03:01:00,450 --> 03:01:02,090
Can I get your infamous bday song?

2507
03:01:03,110 --> 03:01:06,790
Only you twirls a U at the end.

2508
03:01:08,130 --> 03:01:09,210
What do you mean?

2509
03:01:09,490 --> 03:01:10,570
Happy birthday too!

2510
03:01:10,570 --> 03:01:13,790
Happy birthday to you.

2511
03:01:14,130 --> 03:01:16,490
Happy birthday to you.

2512
03:01:16,870 --> 03:01:19,790
Happy birthday Yonatan with a Y.

2513
03:01:20,890 --> 03:01:23,970
Happy birthday to you.

2514
03:01:28,130 --> 03:01:29,570
Happy hag...

2515
03:01:29,570 --> 03:01:31,570
One minute baby!

2516
03:01:32,530 --> 03:01:34,370
OK, maybe I will try the Mosin.

2517
03:01:34,410 --> 03:01:34,810
You know what?

2518
03:01:34,930 --> 03:01:36,330
It doesn't hurt to try new things.

2519
03:01:37,430 --> 03:01:39,270
Let's get... I can't get rid of you.

2520
03:01:40,750 --> 03:01:42,010
Let's put you away.

2521
03:01:42,090 --> 03:01:42,950
I don't need you.

2522
03:01:44,050 --> 03:01:44,730
Oh boy.

2523
03:01:44,990 --> 03:01:48,270
I feel like this is not going to end well for me, but...

2524
03:01:59,480 --> 03:01:59,960
Stop!

2525
03:02:03,140 --> 03:02:04,700
I'm so sick of this.

2526
03:02:11,380 --> 03:02:15,020
He is like... He has so much health, you guys.

2527
03:02:15,100 --> 03:02:17,700
I think I might just... I think it would just be rather...

2528
03:02:18,320 --> 03:02:21,660
I think it would just be better to do lethal, right?

2529
03:02:24,700 --> 03:02:28,160
Honestly, I'm not even going to cure because it's just...

2530
03:02:28,160 --> 03:02:28,980
Snake is hungry?

2531
03:02:30,120 --> 03:02:31,220
I'll let him eat though.

2532
03:02:31,740 --> 03:02:32,680
We can eat.

2533
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:34,580
We can have a rat.

2534
03:02:41,670 --> 03:02:43,870
Snake is so tricky.

2535
03:02:44,150 --> 03:02:45,570
It's like I'm too slow.

2536
03:02:46,790 --> 03:02:47,610
Oh my gosh.

2537
03:02:49,370 --> 03:02:49,850
Hey!

2538
03:03:11,090 --> 03:03:11,530
Stop it!

2539
03:03:19,710 --> 03:03:20,670
We're done, though.

2540
03:03:21,370 --> 03:03:23,090
Shoot him in the face when you knock him down.

2541
03:03:23,250 --> 03:03:23,350
OK.

2542
03:03:29,570 --> 03:03:31,150
Let's change our camouflage.

2543
03:03:33,550 --> 03:03:37,670
What if I put on... Wait, can I put on Rykov's outfit and he goes like...

2544
03:03:38,670 --> 03:03:39,730
Isn't that a thing?

2545
03:03:40,950 --> 03:03:44,090
I put on Rykov's outfit and he gets all like...

2546
03:03:47,870 --> 03:03:49,190
There's a little wig.

2547
03:03:51,200 --> 03:03:54,280
He gets like kind of... He's like... That's my guy.

2548
03:03:55,280 --> 03:03:56,320
I remember that too.

2549
03:04:01,300 --> 03:04:02,980
OK, we'll just keep it like this for now.

2550
03:04:04,800 --> 03:04:05,240
Let's...

2551
03:04:11,040 --> 03:04:11,480
Oh,

2552
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:17,090
wait.

2553
03:04:17,090 --> 03:04:18,770
I can't CQC in this though, can I?

2554
03:04:19,410 --> 03:04:19,850
Ivan.

2555
03:04:22,010 --> 03:04:23,490
I forgot I can't CQC.

2556
03:04:30,630 --> 03:04:32,810
I just ran up to him and was like...

2557
03:04:35,950 --> 03:04:36,390
Shoot!

2558
03:04:43,970 --> 03:04:44,030
Shoot!

2559
03:04:46,610 --> 03:04:49,370
Oh, thank you.

2560
03:05:05,390 --> 03:05:06,690
And then... Shoot!

2561
03:05:08,810 --> 03:05:09,810
In the butt!

2562
03:05:11,790 --> 03:05:13,510
Oh my gosh.

2563
03:05:14,230 --> 03:05:15,070
Fancy tricks.

2564
03:05:16,710 --> 03:05:17,350
Wait!

2565
03:05:21,720 --> 03:05:22,620
Got him in the butt?

2566
03:05:23,660 --> 03:05:24,880
Oh man.

2567
03:05:25,080 --> 03:05:25,280
OK.

2568
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:27,380
I got him in the butt.

2569
03:05:27,560 --> 03:05:28,880
I got a broken bone.

2570
03:05:29,260 --> 03:05:30,220
Getting him in the butt.

2571
03:05:32,240 --> 03:05:32,920
Splint.

2572
03:05:32,920 --> 03:05:33,940
Band-Aid.

2573
03:05:34,760 --> 03:05:35,480
All cured.

2574
03:05:43,240 --> 03:05:44,700
Oh my gosh!

2575
03:05:44,760 --> 03:05:45,520
Every time!

2576
03:06:02,550 --> 03:06:03,230
Wait.

2577
03:06:04,150 --> 03:06:04,610
Oh shoot.

2578
03:06:04,810 --> 03:06:05,070
Whatever.

2579
03:06:10,390 --> 03:06:12,370
I always get him in the butt, baby.

2580
03:06:14,790 --> 03:06:16,470
It's my specialty.

2581
03:06:19,330 --> 03:06:20,090
Oh

2582
03:06:37,400 --> 03:06:38,160
shoot.

2583
03:06:38,380 --> 03:06:39,420
I thought he was going to disengage.

2584
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:42,380
I thought he was not going to be electric anymore.

2585
03:06:43,060 --> 03:06:45,340
OK, he's... He has...

2586
03:06:45,340 --> 03:06:46,080
Ouch!

2587
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:48,040
Every time!

2588
03:06:55,260 --> 03:06:56,840
Same thing.

2589
03:06:57,460 --> 03:06:58,560
Thanks Ocelot.

2590
03:07:01,920 --> 03:07:03,880
Ocelot is the best.

2591
03:07:04,200 --> 03:07:05,820
My best wingman.

2592
03:07:06,200 --> 03:07:06,900
Or hype man.

2593
03:07:07,120 --> 03:07:07,360
Sorry.

2594
03:07:10,100 --> 03:07:12,160
Ocelot is my best hype man.

2595
03:07:14,380 --> 03:07:15,420
Noodle time!

2596
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:18,320
Throw a snake at him?

2597
03:07:19,260 --> 03:07:21,300
I don't have a snake.

2598
03:07:22,520 --> 03:07:23,900
All my stuff is empty.

2599
03:07:24,180 --> 03:07:25,380
I think I used to have one.

2600
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:27,420
Maybe Eva ate it.

2601
03:07:29,460 --> 03:07:32,400
What if I threw a vampire bat at him?

2602
03:07:33,320 --> 03:07:34,480
Probably wouldn't care.

2603
03:07:35,900 --> 03:07:36,420
Frogs?

2604
03:07:37,520 --> 03:07:38,480
What about the frogs?

2605
03:07:43,260 --> 03:07:44,400
Throw a tree frog.

2606
03:07:44,500 --> 03:07:45,020
Try a poison.

2607
03:07:45,120 --> 03:07:45,840
Will he eat it?

2608
03:07:48,160 --> 03:07:49,060
Tasted bad.

2609
03:07:51,380 --> 03:07:52,860
The frogs need to be alive.

2610
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:54,300
Oh he's scared of frogs?

2611
03:07:54,520 --> 03:07:55,220
Wait, seriously?

2612
03:07:56,620 --> 03:07:57,520
Eva ate your snake?

2613
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:58,280
Oh my.

2614
03:07:59,080 --> 03:07:59,780
Wait, seriously?

2615
03:07:59,900 --> 03:08:01,900
He's afraid of frogs?

2616
03:08:02,060 --> 03:08:02,620
I had no idea.

2617
03:08:05,200 --> 03:08:07,720
Why do I need to eat the Russian glow cap though?

2618
03:08:08,600 --> 03:08:09,880
I didn't use anything.

2619
03:08:12,260 --> 03:08:13,520
Use the glow caps.

2620
03:08:13,760 --> 03:08:15,980
Glowing mush attracts lightning.

2621
03:08:20,890 --> 03:08:22,530
Oh, like throw the glow.

2622
03:08:22,830 --> 03:08:25,070
So it's like have it...

2623
03:08:43,120 --> 03:08:44,900
That's the reason behind shooting the hidden keros.

2624
03:08:45,380 --> 03:08:47,880
No way, because he's afraid of the frogs?

2625
03:08:51,260 --> 03:08:52,540
I didn't know that.

2626
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:55,060
You learn something every time.

2627
03:08:59,570 --> 03:09:00,210
OK...

2628
03:09:15,990 --> 03:09:17,050
I'm trying!

2629
03:09:17,970 --> 03:09:18,350
I'm trying!

2630
03:09:20,600 --> 03:09:22,440
He needs to stop being so glowy.

2631
03:09:23,360 --> 03:09:24,660
Oh, wait, can I get him now?

2632
03:09:27,100 --> 03:09:27,740
Oh my God.

2633
03:09:28,300 --> 03:09:28,940
Oh

2634
03:09:33,570 --> 03:09:36,630
my gosh, I seriously get hit every time!

2635
03:09:43,040 --> 03:09:44,060
You guys!

2636
03:09:47,360 --> 03:09:48,340
Phase 2.

2637
03:09:49,140 --> 03:09:50,460
Phase 2, baby.

2638
03:09:59,720 --> 03:10:00,800
Shoot him!

2639
03:10:02,900 --> 03:10:05,400
He's like you told me not to interact.

2640
03:10:06,440 --> 03:10:07,200
Do you hear me?

2641
03:10:07,280 --> 03:10:08,820
I said shoot him!

2642
03:10:11,840 --> 03:10:12,820
Sorry, Colonel.

2643
03:10:13,140 --> 03:10:14,460
I'm afraid I can't do that.

2644
03:10:14,980 --> 03:10:17,160
What do you mean you can't?

2645
03:10:18,040 --> 03:10:20,040
I made a promise to the boss.

2646
03:10:22,380 --> 03:10:22,980
Silence!

2647
03:10:22,980 --> 03:10:25,000
I am your commanding officer.

2648
03:10:40,880 --> 03:10:42,120
He's so weak.

2649
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:44,100
We should be able to beat him easy.

2650
03:10:45,200 --> 03:10:46,400
My authority.

2651
03:10:55,600 --> 03:10:56,900
So awesome.

2652
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:02,700
Yes!

2653
03:11:12,700 --> 03:11:13,720
Rattle!

2654
03:11:21,380 --> 03:11:23,420
The sass.

2655
03:11:23,880 --> 03:11:26,800
I love Ocelot like no one else ever.

2656
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:29,920
Yes!

2657
03:11:45,700 --> 03:11:46,140
Stop!

2658
03:11:46,280 --> 03:11:47,540
Don't look at me like that!

2659
03:11:55,140 --> 03:11:56,180
No, hold on!

2660
03:11:56,480 --> 03:11:57,960
Wait, I think I need to cure.

2661
03:12:01,360 --> 03:12:02,280
Yeah, hold on.

2662
03:12:02,380 --> 03:12:02,980
Hold on, Logan.

2663
03:12:04,880 --> 03:12:05,760
He did nothing.

2664
03:12:06,700 --> 03:12:09,180
Oh my God!

2665
03:12:09,460 --> 03:12:12,820
He's just...he's just him!

2666
03:12:14,600 --> 03:12:15,520
OK.

2667
03:12:17,340 --> 03:12:18,100
Oh gosh.

2668
03:12:18,280 --> 03:12:18,560
OK.

2669
03:12:19,900 --> 03:12:20,860
Phase 2.

2670
03:12:22,420 --> 03:12:23,680
Phase 2.

2671
03:12:33,740 --> 03:12:34,660
Ouch!

2672
03:12:34,840 --> 03:12:38,520
Oh my gosh, I just...I just...I just did that.

2673
03:12:41,080 --> 03:12:42,720
How am I supposed to avoid that?

2674
03:12:52,830 --> 03:12:53,230
OK.

2675
03:12:53,230 --> 03:12:53,630
Ouch!

2676
03:12:53,690 --> 03:12:54,690
Oh my God!

2677
03:12:54,890 --> 03:12:55,290
Wait!

2678
03:12:56,130 --> 03:12:59,070
OK, so when he lifts his hand up in the air...

2679
03:12:59,070 --> 03:13:00,350
Like you just don't care.

2680
03:13:01,230 --> 03:13:01,990
I have to care.

2681
03:13:02,110 --> 03:13:03,150
I have to get down on the ground.

2682
03:13:03,850 --> 03:13:04,510
Crawl, yeah.

2683
03:13:09,030 --> 03:13:11,450
Wait, no, this is not down on the air.

2684
03:13:16,050 --> 03:13:17,010
Oh shit!

2685
03:13:17,230 --> 03:13:19,130
Oh my gosh, I'm such an idiot.

2686
03:13:19,390 --> 03:13:21,010
Hold on, I'm going to use my cure thing.

2687
03:13:21,470 --> 03:13:22,430
Wait, it's in here.

2688
03:13:23,790 --> 03:13:25,390
I'm going to use my life med.

2689
03:13:26,470 --> 03:13:29,050
It's not much, but...

2690
03:13:29,050 --> 03:13:30,850
It's maybe enough.

2691
03:13:31,150 --> 03:13:31,310
OK.

2692
03:13:57,920 --> 03:13:59,760
Oh gosh, we have 2 minutes left.

2693
03:14:01,500 --> 03:14:02,080
Oh shoot!

2694
03:14:07,660 --> 03:14:08,660
Shoot his butt!

2695
03:14:09,200 --> 03:14:09,580
I

2696
03:14:22,460 --> 03:14:23,540
think I'm stupid.

2697
03:14:37,420 --> 03:14:38,020
OK.

2698
03:14:39,060 --> 03:14:39,420
Alright.

2699
03:14:42,800 --> 03:14:43,740
Oh gosh.

2700
03:14:45,760 --> 03:14:46,340
Come on!

2701
03:14:48,810 --> 03:14:50,110
Logan please, let me shoot you.

2702
03:14:51,550 --> 03:14:51,930
But

2703
03:15:05,010 --> 03:15:06,290
I'm not going to risk it otherwise.

2704
03:15:11,050 --> 03:15:12,190
Oh God!

2705
03:15:13,350 --> 03:15:14,310
Oh God!

2706
03:15:15,190 --> 03:15:15,870
Oh God!

2707
03:15:27,770 --> 03:15:29,770
Oh shoot, I didn't realize it was a double.

2708
03:15:30,350 --> 03:15:30,590
No!

2709
03:15:48,450 --> 03:15:49,410
Trank, man.

2710
03:15:49,950 --> 03:15:50,430
Panic

2711
03:16:02,450 --> 03:16:05,090
a little, but it was more so that it's hard to get like...

2712
03:16:05,790 --> 03:16:06,930
It's hard to get shots.

2713
03:16:09,050 --> 03:16:09,890
Dang it.

2714
03:16:10,670 --> 03:16:11,870
From the beginning, right?

2715
03:16:15,090 --> 03:16:15,430
Wait.

2716
03:16:25,210 --> 03:16:27,170
I don't think you should first person.

2717
03:16:27,270 --> 03:16:29,510
I have to or else it doesn't aim for him.

2718
03:16:29,930 --> 03:16:31,650
Otherwise it doesn't aim for him.

2719
03:16:31,790 --> 03:16:33,990
Unless I'm just dumb, I don't know.

2720
03:16:36,710 --> 03:16:39,050
You're having trouble drawing your gun to hit him when he's down.

2721
03:16:39,230 --> 03:16:40,210
Yeah, I am.

2722
03:16:40,230 --> 03:16:40,670
I am.

2723
03:16:40,750 --> 03:16:42,510
Maybe I should try and hit him twice.

2724
03:16:43,110 --> 03:16:45,510
If I have time to get him while he's down.

2725
03:16:45,510 --> 03:16:48,830
It's because after you CQC him, there's a brief...

2726
03:16:48,830 --> 03:16:52,110
There's a very brief point where you can't equip the gun.

2727
03:16:52,990 --> 03:16:54,890
So I'm thinking I have to equip the gun...

2728
03:16:54,890 --> 03:16:58,750
Or rather, I have to have the gun equipped when I CQC him.

2729
03:16:58,890 --> 03:17:00,490
So that it's already prepped.

2730
03:17:00,950 --> 03:17:03,510
I think that's what I...

2731
03:17:05,250 --> 03:17:07,470
Have to... Yeah, equip before CQC.

2732
03:17:07,570 --> 03:17:08,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2733
03:17:08,370 --> 03:17:13,050
So I think that's where we will get a little bit better.

2734
03:17:17,030 --> 03:17:18,310
But why do you unequip?

2735
03:17:18,650 --> 03:17:21,470
Because it says if you have it equipped, it will explode.

2736
03:17:21,830 --> 03:17:23,530
He explodes the bullets and then it hurts you.

2737
03:17:24,190 --> 03:17:26,150
So I just unequip it.

2738
03:17:28,310 --> 03:17:30,290
Because it's easier, I guess.

2739
03:17:30,390 --> 03:17:30,750
I don't know.

2740
03:17:32,290 --> 03:17:34,710
Yeah, I have everything in here.

2741
03:17:39,910 --> 03:17:43,010
He took out all her MK22 ammo on the first run.

2742
03:17:44,310 --> 03:17:47,270
Yeah, because he blew it up.

2743
03:17:49,870 --> 03:17:55,530
Yeah, Vulcan does an attack that blows up your gun and makes you lose ammo.

2744
03:17:55,910 --> 03:17:57,290
Yep, yep, yep.

2745
03:17:58,710 --> 03:17:59,190
Yep, yep.

2746
03:18:00,570 --> 03:18:02,870
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

2747
03:18:03,230 --> 03:18:03,990
Okay, alright.

2748
03:18:11,750 --> 03:18:12,830
The music.

2749
03:18:18,250 --> 03:18:19,270
I'm dodging.

2750
03:18:20,690 --> 03:18:21,530
Oh shoot.

2751
03:18:21,870 --> 03:18:23,370
Oh my God.

2752
03:18:25,230 --> 03:18:26,450
Oh shoot, I forgot.

2753
03:18:26,670 --> 03:18:26,990
I'm so sorry.

2754
03:18:30,230 --> 03:18:31,870
Okay, I got two at least.

2755
03:18:32,630 --> 03:18:33,370
Here what comes?

2756
03:18:34,170 --> 03:18:35,230
What's coming?

2757
03:18:36,050 --> 03:18:36,750
Who's coming?

2758
03:18:37,450 --> 03:18:38,730
What is this?

2759
03:18:38,870 --> 03:18:39,950
What is this move?

2760
03:18:41,590 --> 03:18:43,190
What are you doing?

2761
03:18:43,390 --> 03:18:43,590
Okay.

2762
03:18:48,290 --> 03:18:49,570
Oh, okay.

2763
03:18:50,430 --> 03:18:53,130
I should run towards him during that bar.

2764
03:18:54,710 --> 03:18:56,830
Okay, are we gonna do anything?

2765
03:18:57,030 --> 03:18:57,490
Vulcan!

2766
03:18:58,470 --> 03:18:59,370
Thank you!

2767
03:18:59,470 --> 03:19:01,210
I love you so much!

2768
03:19:02,870 --> 03:19:03,430
Come

2769
03:19:25,250 --> 03:19:26,910
on, let me CQC you please.

2770
03:19:31,140 --> 03:19:32,520
Can I shoot him here?

2771
03:19:35,240 --> 03:19:36,260
I could've.

2772
03:19:36,560 --> 03:19:36,760
I'm seeking.

2773
03:19:37,020 --> 03:19:37,660
Okay, okay.

2774
03:19:38,480 --> 03:19:41,240
I'm testing stuff out guys.

2775
03:19:53,620 --> 03:19:55,440
Can you summon stuff?

2776
03:19:56,160 --> 03:19:57,180
Oh, don't, don't, don't.

2777
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:00,780
Oh shoot!

2778
03:20:01,040 --> 03:20:02,120
That was too slow.

2779
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:07,340
Gosh, I'm not close enough to him.

2780
03:20:07,960 --> 03:20:08,920
Every time.

2781
03:20:09,100 --> 03:20:10,240
Wait, am I losing my bullets?

2782
03:20:10,400 --> 03:20:11,000
I can't tell.

2783
03:20:13,520 --> 03:20:16,960
Am I losing my bullets when I get hit by him?

2784
03:20:17,100 --> 03:20:17,880
I don't know.

2785
03:20:18,600 --> 03:20:19,080
No?

2786
03:20:19,240 --> 03:20:19,700
Okay, cool.

2787
03:20:27,180 --> 03:20:28,720
Oh fucking hell!

2788
03:20:32,590 --> 03:20:34,070
Guys, I think I'm just gonna restart.

2789
03:20:34,830 --> 03:20:35,270
Kill me!

2790
03:20:35,370 --> 03:20:35,670
Kill me!

2791
03:20:36,110 --> 03:20:36,590
I

2792
03:20:42,950 --> 03:20:45,410
just wanna restart you guys.

2793
03:20:45,530 --> 03:20:46,810
I don't wanna keep going.

2794
03:20:49,050 --> 03:20:50,570
I don't wanna keep going.

2795
03:20:50,690 --> 03:20:51,470
I wanna restart.

2796
03:20:52,850 --> 03:20:53,950
Can you just kill me?

2797
03:20:54,350 --> 03:20:55,250
Just kill me.

2798
03:21:04,460 --> 03:21:04,700
See?

2799
03:21:04,840 --> 03:21:05,000
See?

2800
03:21:05,080 --> 03:21:05,200
See?

2801
03:21:08,120 --> 03:21:08,560
Be

2802
03:21:11,660 --> 03:21:12,860
up on your butt.

2803
03:21:13,240 --> 03:21:15,300
What if I'm just up on your butt the whole time?

2804
03:21:31,340 --> 03:21:33,920
If you can't have me on my hat, you don't deserve me on my Judo.

2805
03:21:37,960 --> 03:21:38,700
Let's heal.

2806
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:40,300
Let's heal.

2807
03:21:40,940 --> 03:21:42,540
I mean, I might as well try.

2808
03:21:45,840 --> 03:21:46,920
So funny.

2809
03:21:49,060 --> 03:21:50,480
So many gunshot wounds.

2810
03:21:50,640 --> 03:21:51,360
Snake, are you okay?

2811
03:21:58,370 --> 03:21:59,210
Let's eat.

2812
03:22:02,130 --> 03:22:04,410
Just go all in on the face.

2813
03:22:04,930 --> 03:22:05,730
Yeah baby!

2814
03:22:06,830 --> 03:22:08,370
Actually no, I'm gonna eat the ramen.

2815
03:22:09,350 --> 03:22:10,470
For you Snake.

2816
03:22:10,670 --> 03:22:11,550
A delicious meal.

2817
03:22:13,690 --> 03:22:14,810
That's damn good.

2818
03:22:32,840 --> 03:22:33,800
My gosh!

2819
03:22:46,180 --> 03:22:47,140
Disinfect.

2820
03:22:50,880 --> 03:22:53,160
What am I using?

2821
03:22:54,700 --> 03:22:55,640
For bleeding.

2822
03:22:57,660 --> 03:22:58,260
There we go.

2823
03:22:58,260 --> 03:22:58,640
The stick.

2824
03:23:16,810 --> 03:23:17,770
Oh shoot.

2825
03:23:18,370 --> 03:23:20,350
He was good for like 2 seconds.

2826
03:23:25,880 --> 03:23:26,700
Oh my gosh.

2827
03:23:51,900 --> 03:23:52,920
Everything is bad.

2828
03:23:53,660 --> 03:23:53,980
Before

2829
03:23:59,090 --> 03:24:00,190
I shoot him.

2830
03:24:02,570 --> 03:24:04,750
I don't think this is the run either guys.

2831
03:24:04,910 --> 03:24:06,310
Let me cure while I'm at it.

2832
03:24:07,470 --> 03:24:09,510
The auto aim seems to be very questionable.

2833
03:24:09,510 --> 03:24:12,470
I know, he just shoots in the middle of the room.

2834
03:25:05,260 --> 03:25:06,740
This is the run.

2835
03:25:12,400 --> 03:25:14,240
We almost clutched that.

2836
03:25:14,960 --> 03:25:16,720
That was so close man.

2837
03:25:18,580 --> 03:25:19,560
We almost clutched that.

2838
03:25:19,940 --> 03:25:21,540
We are getting closer every time.

2839
03:25:22,480 --> 03:25:23,360
Every time baby.

2840
03:25:24,080 --> 03:25:24,440
It's okay.

2841
03:25:25,660 --> 03:25:26,580
It's only...

2842
03:25:26,580 --> 03:25:27,220
It's alright.

2843
03:25:27,460 --> 03:25:28,420
We got this guys.

2844
03:25:28,520 --> 03:25:29,160
We got this.

2845
03:25:31,620 --> 03:25:32,340
I believe.

2846
03:25:33,660 --> 03:25:34,800
I mean I have to.

2847
03:25:34,980 --> 03:25:36,660
I have to beat the game eventually.

2848
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:40,920
I have to.

2849
03:25:42,160 --> 03:25:44,060
Will Rykov actually give us extra hits?

2850
03:25:44,360 --> 03:25:46,060
Do I have to... I just put on the mask right?

2851
03:25:46,920 --> 03:25:47,320
Oh wait.

2852
03:25:50,520 --> 03:25:51,640
Let's see what he does.

2853
03:26:02,070 --> 03:26:03,610
Here it comes.

2854
03:26:04,450 --> 03:26:05,150
Thank you.

2855
03:26:05,630 --> 03:26:06,870
Thanks Ivan.

2856
03:26:13,930 --> 03:26:14,530
Alright.

2857
03:26:23,720 --> 03:26:25,080
Oh sh**, sh**, sh**!

2858
03:26:25,840 --> 03:26:26,840
Oh my gosh.

2859
03:26:27,440 --> 03:26:27,640
No!

2860
03:26:27,940 --> 03:26:29,500
Get him, get him, get him!

2861
03:26:29,740 --> 03:26:32,260
Get him!

2862
03:26:32,680 --> 03:26:33,060
Oh shoot.

2863
03:26:33,440 --> 03:26:33,820
Come on!

2864
03:26:34,780 --> 03:26:35,380
Please!

2865
03:26:35,740 --> 03:26:36,260
Shoot him!

2866
03:26:50,360 --> 03:26:51,460
And shoot!

2867
03:26:51,840 --> 03:26:52,660
Shoot him!

2868
03:26:52,860 --> 03:26:53,460
Shoot him!

2869
03:26:58,120 --> 03:26:58,980
All that I could get.

2870
03:26:59,260 --> 03:26:59,800
Keep it up.

2871
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:00,380
Thank you!

2872
03:27:00,380 --> 03:27:01,500
Thanks!

2873
03:27:01,580 --> 03:27:02,480
Thanks Ocelot.

2874
03:27:02,560 --> 03:27:05,020
I really appreciate when you tell me good things.

2875
03:27:07,000 --> 03:27:10,700
Really appreciate it when you tell me good things.

2876
03:27:11,100 --> 03:27:14,800
It really motivates me Ocelot!

2877
03:27:17,480 --> 03:27:19,000
Solid hits, good combo.

2878
03:27:19,160 --> 03:27:19,800
Thank you!

2879
03:28:00,100 --> 03:28:02,460
Why aren't you using the thermal goggles?

2880
03:28:07,640 --> 03:28:08,040
Alright.

2881
03:28:12,900 --> 03:28:14,600
Oh gosh, it scared me for a second.

2882
03:28:14,720 --> 03:28:15,260
I was like hello?

2883
03:28:16,220 --> 03:28:16,540
Hello?

2884
03:28:25,030 --> 03:28:27,890
I feel like there should be a Mint vs Bosses funny compilation.

2885
03:28:28,090 --> 03:28:28,950
Is this funny to you?

2886
03:28:29,330 --> 03:28:31,390
Is my afterlife a joke to you?

2887
03:28:32,890 --> 03:28:37,330
I strive to one day find someone who looks at me the same way Ocelot looks at Snake.

2888
03:28:37,490 --> 03:28:39,510
That's why I love Ocelot so much.

2889
03:28:40,450 --> 03:28:41,490
I get him, you know.

2890
03:28:42,790 --> 03:28:44,050
I get him.

2891
03:28:53,220 --> 03:28:55,720
He recovers so much more quickly, you know.

2892
03:29:04,630 --> 03:29:05,270
Please!

2893
03:29:05,730 --> 03:29:05,990
Please!

2894
03:29:07,290 --> 03:29:08,330
Oh shoot.

2895
03:29:08,910 --> 03:29:09,210
OK.

2896
03:29:23,160 --> 03:29:24,380
He's doing it again, right?

2897
03:29:35,220 --> 03:29:35,860
Shoot.

2898
03:29:40,090 --> 03:29:42,450
I need to really get into him.

2899
03:29:44,910 --> 03:29:46,350
I got low ammo.

2900
03:29:46,950 --> 03:29:49,010
I do have low ammo.

2901
03:29:50,450 --> 03:29:52,730
If I can get some...

2902
03:29:53,450 --> 03:29:54,090
Oh my gosh.

2903
03:29:56,760 --> 03:29:57,400
Ocelot!

2904
03:29:57,580 --> 03:29:57,960
Oh shoot.

2905
03:29:58,540 --> 03:30:02,880
I don't think Ocelot throws this kind of ammo though, does he?

2906
03:30:04,540 --> 03:30:05,160
Oh my god.

2907
03:30:05,540 --> 03:30:06,100
Watch out!

2908
03:30:06,780 --> 03:30:07,720
Dang it!

2909
03:30:30,310 --> 03:30:31,390
You idiot!

2910
03:30:31,710 --> 03:30:32,330
You idiot!

2911
03:30:33,270 --> 03:30:34,330
You idiot!

2912
03:30:42,020 --> 03:30:43,680
Will the sick spray work?

2913
03:30:46,640 --> 03:30:47,000
OK.

2914
03:30:48,460 --> 03:30:49,260
Let's try it.

2915
03:30:49,620 --> 03:30:52,000
We are almost out.

2916
03:30:56,230 --> 03:30:57,770
He blew up my ammo.

2917
03:31:01,260 --> 03:31:02,520
He blew it up!

2918
03:31:08,780 --> 03:31:09,980
How am I supposed to...

2919
03:31:24,470 --> 03:31:26,030
I have so much time.

2920
03:31:29,500 --> 03:31:32,280
I have so much time, but I need to...

2921
03:31:32,280 --> 03:31:32,900
Oh shoot.

2922
03:31:33,240 --> 03:31:34,180
I thought he was...

2923
03:31:39,100 --> 03:31:40,460
Oh shoot!

2924
03:31:43,600 --> 03:31:44,500
There we go.

2925
03:31:46,900 --> 03:31:47,860
I'm hungry.

2926
03:31:47,860 --> 03:31:50,680
Oh gosh.

2927
03:31:55,220 --> 03:31:56,580
This fight seems really frustrating.

2928
03:31:56,680 --> 03:31:57,800
It's actually not so bad.

2929
03:31:57,960 --> 03:32:03,760
It's that I'm doing it in a more difficult way because I'm doing it non-lethal.

2930
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:08,660
If I was doing it lethal, I would be able to use the big guns and it would be way more faster, but...

2931
03:32:08,660 --> 03:32:12,140
This is my first time, well actually this is my second time ever fighting this guy.

2932
03:32:12,980 --> 03:32:14,040
Playing this game.

2933
03:32:14,700 --> 03:32:17,500
And it's always my first time ever doing non-lethal, so...

2934
03:32:17,500 --> 03:32:19,880
You know, I'm gonna be a little clumsy about it.

2935
03:32:21,540 --> 03:32:22,620
Does that work?

2936
03:32:23,360 --> 03:32:24,500
He like blocks it.

2937
03:32:24,540 --> 03:32:25,240
Is it actually working?

2938
03:32:25,960 --> 03:32:26,660
Oh shoot!

2939
03:32:29,640 --> 03:32:31,240
He's like blocking it though.

2940
03:32:40,780 --> 03:32:41,380
Nice.

2941
03:32:43,180 --> 03:32:44,100
It works?

2942
03:32:44,220 --> 03:32:45,300
OK, I'm gonna do this.

2943
03:33:02,090 --> 03:33:03,290
I was...

2944
03:33:03,290 --> 03:33:04,510
Too slow.

2945
03:33:08,760 --> 03:33:09,200
See?

2946
03:33:09,600 --> 03:33:10,320
Oh my gosh.

2947
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:11,800
Alright, hold on.

2948
03:33:12,200 --> 03:33:13,600
This is desperate times.

2949
03:33:13,660 --> 03:33:14,580
We have 30 seconds left.

2950
03:33:14,760 --> 03:33:15,420
Oh gosh!

2951
03:33:18,820 --> 03:33:19,640
No more ammo.

2952
03:33:19,780 --> 03:33:21,520
This left, but we have the Mosin.

2953
03:33:24,880 --> 03:33:25,700
In the corner?

2954
03:33:25,920 --> 03:33:26,580
Like that corner?

2955
03:33:28,600 --> 03:33:29,300
Oh my gosh.

2956
03:33:29,580 --> 03:33:30,360
No, no, no, no.

2957
03:33:30,540 --> 03:33:31,220
Like this corner.

2958
03:33:32,160 --> 03:33:32,720
Oh

2959
03:33:37,360 --> 03:33:37,520
no!

2960
03:33:37,640 --> 03:33:38,440
He's doing it, he's doing it.

2961
03:33:38,480 --> 03:33:38,940
Oh gosh.

2962
03:33:39,640 --> 03:33:42,160
I don't

2963
03:33:48,040 --> 03:33:50,560
have any confidence in this right now.

2964
03:33:51,340 --> 03:33:51,780
Oh shoot.

2965
03:33:57,060 --> 03:33:58,320
I gotta get down.

2966
03:34:24,770 --> 03:34:27,030
Literally one hit away.

2967
03:34:27,270 --> 03:34:28,890
One hit away.

2968
03:34:34,560 --> 03:34:35,240
So close.

2969
03:34:35,300 --> 03:34:36,540
I gotta pick up the...

2970
03:34:37,240 --> 03:34:40,540
I have to pick up the other ammo more...

2971
03:34:41,920 --> 03:34:42,480
Quickly.

2972
03:34:45,580 --> 03:34:46,020
Ah...

2973
03:34:51,840 --> 03:34:54,320
How did you fumble it at the end like that?

2974
03:34:54,440 --> 03:34:55,500
Oh, I don't know.

2975
03:34:55,640 --> 03:34:56,580
You know, it's just...

2976
03:34:57,440 --> 03:34:59,460
It's a Minto staple, you know.

2977
03:34:59,920 --> 03:35:00,540
It's OK.

2978
03:35:00,700 --> 03:35:01,760
Oh, what the?

2979
03:35:02,440 --> 03:35:03,320
I'm your boyfriend!

2980
03:35:03,660 --> 03:35:04,120
Oh yeah, see?

2981
03:35:10,870 --> 03:35:11,910
Ah, hold on.

2982
03:35:12,910 --> 03:35:15,210
You know, be nice to me you guys.

2983
03:35:15,370 --> 03:35:15,810
Come on.

2984
03:35:16,350 --> 03:35:17,230
Don't be rude.

2985
03:35:18,170 --> 03:35:19,250
Don't be rude.

2986
03:35:19,430 --> 03:35:20,310
People fumble.

2987
03:35:20,610 --> 03:35:21,710
Also, I'm streaming.

2988
03:35:21,910 --> 03:35:22,850
It's like completely different.

2989
03:35:23,290 --> 03:35:28,510
If you've never streamed and played a game before, it's like you don't understand...

2990
03:35:28,510 --> 03:35:30,010
The first like...

2991
03:35:30,450 --> 03:35:30,870
The...

2992
03:35:31,890 --> 03:35:32,550
What's it called?

2993
03:35:32,610 --> 03:35:35,590
The performance anxiety that you get.

2994
03:35:36,170 --> 03:35:39,230
And then, also, I'm just like, you know...

2995
03:36:08,010 --> 03:36:09,970
Oh shoot, I thought it was gonna...

2996
03:36:14,100 --> 03:36:14,960
Oh my gosh.

2997
03:36:15,100 --> 03:36:16,260
I try...

2998
03:36:16,260 --> 03:36:17,840
I try every time.

2999
03:36:17,940 --> 03:36:19,540
I literally do try every time.

3000
03:36:23,870 --> 03:36:26,170
Don't roll, but otherwise...

3001
03:36:26,170 --> 03:36:27,590
I get hit anyway.

3002
03:36:28,570 --> 03:36:29,930
I run, I get hit.

3003
03:36:32,680 --> 03:36:34,720
Nothing works for me.

3004
03:36:41,480 --> 03:36:44,800
I didn't

3005
03:37:01,530 --> 03:37:02,550
even notice.

3006
03:37:11,420 --> 03:37:12,460
Please, shoot him!

3007
03:37:12,760 --> 03:37:13,140
Shoot him!

3008
03:37:13,320 --> 03:37:13,880
Shoot him!

3009
03:37:14,140 --> 03:37:14,560
Shoot him!

3010
03:37:20,710 --> 03:37:24,050
Ok, we got the first bit down, you know.

3011
03:37:24,230 --> 03:37:24,930
Well, almost.

3012
03:37:25,130 --> 03:37:25,410
Kinda.

3013
03:37:29,410 --> 03:37:31,670
You know, I can get there.

3014
03:37:32,370 --> 03:37:33,530
It's just...

3015
03:37:33,530 --> 03:37:35,370
It's just the second part.

3016
03:37:36,310 --> 03:37:37,350
Round 2, baby.

3017
03:37:40,150 --> 03:37:40,710
Really?

3018
03:37:45,700 --> 03:37:46,260
Right

3019
03:37:51,180 --> 03:37:52,000
where you're going to.

3020
03:37:52,420 --> 03:37:53,080
Can you not?

3021
03:37:56,780 --> 03:37:57,440
Ah, see!

3022
03:37:58,400 --> 03:37:59,180
Oh my God.

3023
03:38:12,700 --> 03:38:13,360
Oh shoot!

3024
03:38:15,800 --> 03:38:16,600
I tried.

3025
03:39:05,630 --> 03:39:06,310
So close!

3026
03:39:06,350 --> 03:39:06,650
So close!

3027
03:39:06,710 --> 03:39:07,570
You guys are so close.

3028
03:39:08,410 --> 03:39:09,890
Oh, I don't like this one actually.

3029
03:39:16,700 --> 03:39:17,660
Shoot him while he's down!

3030
03:39:18,740 --> 03:39:19,420
Shoot him while he's down!

3031
03:39:32,540 --> 03:39:32,940
Shoot!

3032
03:39:35,200 --> 03:39:35,780
Dang it.

3033
03:39:36,400 --> 03:39:36,960
Come on, Volcan!

3034
03:39:37,780 --> 03:39:40,600
Oh, I think I could've.

3035
03:39:40,700 --> 03:39:41,380
Maybe I could've.

3036
03:39:41,500 --> 03:39:42,120
Actually, I'm not sure.

3037
03:39:43,300 --> 03:39:44,420
He's all charged.

3038
03:39:45,220 --> 03:39:46,500
He's all charged.

3039
03:39:47,040 --> 03:39:47,460
No!

3040
03:39:47,760 --> 03:39:48,880
C3 Explosives!

3041
03:39:48,940 --> 03:39:50,420
I have like one hit on this guy.

3042
03:39:50,500 --> 03:39:50,740
Please.

3043
03:39:51,840 --> 03:39:52,260
Please.

3044
03:39:53,720 --> 03:39:54,140
Please.

3045
03:39:59,000 --> 03:39:59,420
Oh,

3046
03:40:04,030 --> 03:40:04,450
I got him.

3047
03:40:04,510 --> 03:40:05,920
I got a CQC on him.

3048
03:40:08,190 --> 03:40:09,150
And shoot him!

3049
03:40:09,390 --> 03:40:09,690
Shoot him!

3050
03:40:09,950 --> 03:40:10,270
Shoot him!

3051
03:40:12,050 --> 03:40:12,710
Yippee!

3052
03:40:13,310 --> 03:40:17,750
Shoot him while he's down.

3053
03:40:25,240 --> 03:40:27,340
Assume the position, Volcan.

3054
03:40:29,160 --> 03:40:29,740
What?

3055
03:40:30,300 --> 03:40:31,580
Should I just kick him in the butt?

3056
03:40:34,180 --> 03:40:34,840
Yeah!

3057
03:40:35,580 --> 03:40:37,120
I tried to kick him in the butt.

3058
03:40:44,240 --> 03:40:45,160
Yeah, baby!

3059
03:40:46,340 --> 03:40:46,960
Alright.

3060
03:40:48,160 --> 03:40:51,600
One of three boss fights to go.

3061
03:40:53,060 --> 03:40:56,920
One of three ending boss fights to go.

3062
03:40:59,080 --> 03:40:59,980
Let's go.

3063
03:41:01,020 --> 03:41:02,540
I don't even have to heal this time.

3064
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:08,100
Go, Snake, go!

3065
03:41:10,900 --> 03:41:13,520
I wish I could...I want to see the...

3066
03:41:13,520 --> 03:41:15,980
The camo he gave me.

3067
03:41:18,600 --> 03:41:20,180
My Oshi is a gamer.

3068
03:41:22,380 --> 03:41:23,260
Thank you.

3069
03:41:24,020 --> 03:41:25,420
Congrats on getting an OP uniform.

3070
03:41:25,560 --> 03:41:26,100
Thank you!

3071
03:41:26,940 --> 03:41:30,220
First time defeating him non-lethal.

3072
03:41:30,900 --> 03:41:32,140
Everybody run!

3073
03:41:39,400 --> 03:41:43,580
And also I'm like...I'm like four hours of sleep.

3074
03:41:43,780 --> 03:41:45,280
I'm not doing so bad I guess.

3075
03:41:47,180 --> 03:41:48,840
We're all gonna die!

3076
03:41:51,100 --> 03:41:52,940
I can't with him.

3077
03:41:53,360 --> 03:41:57,620
He's just absolutely the perfect freak in my life, in my afterlife.

3078
03:41:57,620 --> 03:42:00,060
Oh, Ocelot!

3079
03:42:00,140 --> 03:42:01,880
I wish I had known you when I was alive.

3080
03:42:07,200 --> 03:42:10,780
I'm so gachikoi for him in like the least romantic way.

3081
03:42:10,860 --> 03:42:12,120
I don't know how to explain it.

3082
03:42:12,420 --> 03:42:16,820
There's just something about Ocelot in my brain that I just can't...I just can't!

3083
03:42:20,180 --> 03:42:21,680
We throw down bad, but no!

3084
03:42:22,400 --> 03:42:23,580
It's just...I don't know.

3085
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:25,120
I just get him so much.

3086
03:42:26,060 --> 03:42:26,620
Instant knife!

3087
03:42:26,700 --> 03:42:27,460
Thanks for the ten kisses!

3088
03:42:28,800 --> 03:42:32,440
He's like my soulmate, but not in a romantic way.

3089
03:42:32,820 --> 03:42:35,020
You know, I understand him so much.

3090
03:42:36,200 --> 03:42:37,820
Simp recognize simp.

3091
03:42:39,360 --> 03:42:40,360
Don't give up!

3092
03:42:41,960 --> 03:42:42,780
Sorry, it sucks.

3093
03:42:45,420 --> 03:42:47,000
They're just so dramatic about it.

3094
03:42:57,460 --> 03:42:57,460
What?

3095
03:42:57,660 --> 03:42:59,960
I've still got one last job to do.

3096
03:43:01,980 --> 03:43:04,160
The boss is already at the lake.

3097
03:43:07,480 --> 03:43:08,660
She's at the lake.

3098
03:43:10,380 --> 03:43:11,820
She's waiting for you there.

3099
03:43:13,120 --> 03:43:14,220
Waiting for me?

3100
03:43:18,800 --> 03:43:20,280
Maybe we shouldn't go.

3101
03:43:20,620 --> 03:43:22,300
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.

3102
03:43:22,500 --> 03:43:23,520
Bad things are exploding.

3103
03:43:28,640 --> 03:43:30,560
I don't want you to fight her.

3104
03:43:30,560 --> 03:43:38,720
But I...I've come to realize that there's a special relationship between you two.

3105
03:43:40,740 --> 03:43:42,620
Something I can't understand.

3106
03:43:42,900 --> 03:43:45,160
Something that goes beyond a man and a woman.

3107
03:43:45,700 --> 03:43:47,540
Oh, I envy you.

3108
03:43:48,620 --> 03:43:49,700
Really, I do.

3109
03:43:50,400 --> 03:43:53,660
But I guess I just can't understand it.

3110
03:43:56,020 --> 03:43:57,040
Thanks for the ten kisses!

3111
03:43:57,040 --> 03:43:58,620
She asked me to tell you something.

3112
03:43:58,620 --> 03:44:03,500
I've never seen someone with such clear eyes.

3113
03:44:11,880 --> 03:44:12,440
There.

3114
03:44:14,220 --> 03:44:15,180
I said it.

3115
03:44:16,000 --> 03:44:18,060
What did she ask to tell me, though?

3116
03:44:18,060 --> 03:44:18,600
Ready to go?

3117
03:44:19,220 --> 03:44:20,160
Wait, she didn't say it.

3118
03:44:24,160 --> 03:44:25,280
Oh boy.

3119
03:44:26,540 --> 03:44:27,960
Uh-oh, what could that be?

3120
03:44:34,330 --> 03:44:35,650
Is that...

3121
03:44:35,650 --> 03:44:36,370
No way!

3122
03:44:36,990 --> 03:44:38,370
So it's not...

3123
03:44:38,370 --> 03:44:39,430
Shacklehide!

3124
03:44:42,970 --> 03:44:43,630
No!

3125
03:44:44,070 --> 03:44:44,630
Metal Gear?

3126
03:44:44,790 --> 03:44:45,910
No, this isn't Metal Gear.

3127
03:44:46,230 --> 03:44:47,190
This is Shacklehide.

3128
03:44:49,490 --> 03:44:50,890
Not yet, Snake!

3129
03:44:51,310 --> 03:44:52,310
It's not over yet!

3130
03:44:57,350 --> 03:44:58,670
Not good.

3131
03:45:02,630 --> 03:45:05,570
You guys, I forgot another boss battle.

3132
03:45:06,350 --> 03:45:08,070
Actually, that we also have to do.

3133
03:45:09,710 --> 03:45:12,390
I forgot another boss battle we have to do.

3134
03:45:15,290 --> 03:45:16,210
Before we...

3135
03:45:16,210 --> 03:45:16,890
Ok, hold on.

3136
03:45:17,030 --> 03:45:18,590
I want to change into the new camo.

3137
03:45:41,160 --> 03:45:43,700
Ok guys, heads or tails?

3138
03:45:44,400 --> 03:45:45,100
Heads or tails?

3139
03:45:45,200 --> 03:45:45,560
Heads or tails?

3140
03:45:45,660 --> 03:45:46,080
Heads or tails?

3141
03:45:49,420 --> 03:45:50,300
Heads or tails?

3142
03:45:53,340 --> 03:45:53,860
Heads?

3143
03:45:54,100 --> 03:45:54,520
Tails?

3144
03:45:54,760 --> 03:45:54,960
Ok.

3145
03:46:01,720 --> 03:46:03,320
Oh wait, he's going to throw up.

3146
03:46:06,620 --> 03:46:07,140
Heads!

3147
03:46:09,480 --> 03:46:10,560
What does this do?

3148
03:46:14,200 --> 03:46:15,380
Don't puke on Eva.

3149
03:46:15,960 --> 03:46:16,620
Oh, he didn't puke.

3150
03:46:16,820 --> 03:46:17,920
He's stronger now.

3151
03:46:18,750 --> 03:46:20,360
It's actually Vulcan's underwear?

3152
03:46:20,560 --> 03:46:22,820
Snake, can you explain to me why is this broken?

3153
03:46:27,000 --> 03:46:30,280
It wasn't strong enough.

3154
03:46:32,940 --> 03:46:33,520
No!

3155
03:46:38,700 --> 03:46:39,840
They emptied it.

3156
03:46:41,300 --> 03:46:41,500
No!

3157
03:46:46,300 --> 03:46:48,120
Oh, they don't shoot you if they see you.

3158
03:46:48,200 --> 03:46:48,780
Oh my gosh.

3159
03:46:48,900 --> 03:46:50,540
Can you face them?

3160
03:46:51,920 --> 03:46:53,460
They aggravate with the American side.

3161
03:46:53,760 --> 03:46:55,180
Ok, that's what I thought would happen.

3162
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:56,400
That's so funny.

3163
03:46:57,260 --> 03:46:59,120
It's all yours.

3164
03:47:00,960 --> 03:47:01,440
Hold on.

3165
03:47:01,600 --> 03:47:03,180
I've never heard these before actually.

3166
03:47:03,320 --> 03:47:03,880
Now I think about it.

3167
03:47:03,880 --> 03:47:03,880
They don't shoot.

3168
03:47:04,280 --> 03:47:05,920
If they catch up to you, you're dead.

3169
03:47:06,160 --> 03:47:07,540
You've got to get away from them.

3170
03:47:09,040 --> 03:47:11,080
I've never heard these.

3171
03:47:11,420 --> 03:47:12,480
I don't think I've ever called them.

3172
03:47:16,120 --> 03:47:17,600
The M63, yeah.

3173
03:47:25,940 --> 03:47:27,840
We got this.

3174
03:47:29,240 --> 03:47:29,720
Ok.

3175
03:47:32,360 --> 03:47:35,660
Change the camera angle and enjoy the absolute cinema.

3176
03:47:39,700 --> 03:47:41,800
Oh yeah, that's right.

3177
03:47:41,980 --> 03:47:42,620
Infinite ammo.

3178
03:47:49,060 --> 03:47:52,180
Let's get our big guns out, baby.

3179
03:47:52,980 --> 03:47:54,700
The big guns out.

3180
03:47:55,760 --> 03:47:57,240
Put you away.

3181
03:47:58,660 --> 03:47:59,740
You, baby.

3182
03:48:00,920 --> 03:48:01,360
Alright.

3183
03:48:03,040 --> 03:48:04,320
Guns a blazing.

3184
03:48:41,200 --> 03:48:42,520
Wait, this is so cool.

3185
03:48:54,900 --> 03:48:56,380
Wait, this is so awesome.

3186
03:48:57,780 --> 03:48:59,640
I am, I'm shooting, I'm shooting, I'm shooting.

3187
03:49:07,320 --> 03:49:09,140
Oh my god, it looks so awesome.

3188
03:49:09,960 --> 03:49:11,380
Wait, can you turn around, Sync?

3189
03:49:11,660 --> 03:49:12,760
Sync, turn the other way.

3190
03:49:13,140 --> 03:49:13,620
Sync, turn.

3191
03:49:14,140 --> 03:49:15,360
Turn that way.

3192
03:49:15,440 --> 03:49:15,780
There you go.

3193
03:49:24,610 --> 03:49:26,370
Hit literally anybody, please.

3194
03:49:32,790 --> 03:49:34,530
Ok, I'll try first person maybe.

3195
03:49:34,790 --> 03:49:36,230
Oh, but I want to see these angles.

3196
03:49:36,330 --> 03:49:37,370
They are so awesome.

3197
03:49:45,310 --> 03:49:46,670
It's like a movie reel.

3198
03:50:00,190 --> 03:50:01,890
Normal angles, it's just like this.

3199
03:50:01,950 --> 03:50:03,290
Like you're just traveling with it, right?

3200
03:50:03,290 --> 03:50:05,470
But with this it kind of moves, you know?

3201
03:50:05,930 --> 03:50:07,150
It's so good.

3202
03:50:09,310 --> 03:50:11,490
This camera angle is awesome!

3203
03:50:12,410 --> 03:50:14,210
I feel like they should have changed it.

3204
03:50:21,490 --> 03:50:22,690
Oh no!

3205
03:50:25,550 --> 03:50:26,750
Maybe we...

3206
03:50:27,930 --> 03:50:29,370
Those are your men, Volgin!

3207
03:50:33,290 --> 03:50:34,550
Let's head for the rail bridge.

3208
03:50:39,110 --> 03:50:41,470
And then blow it up!

3209
03:50:45,050 --> 03:50:45,410
RPG.

3210
03:50:46,190 --> 03:50:47,150
I don't have that.

3211
03:50:48,990 --> 03:50:50,070
I don't have that.

3212
03:50:51,110 --> 03:50:51,570
Puzzle!

3213
03:50:54,370 --> 03:50:55,890
He would have made that.

3214
03:51:09,650 --> 03:51:10,670
It's just a baby.

3215
03:51:12,430 --> 03:51:15,170
You don't... You're not good enough yet.

3216
03:51:25,090 --> 03:51:26,690
Sorry, I can't get over it.

3217
03:51:26,750 --> 03:51:27,210
It's so funny.

3218
03:51:37,370 --> 03:51:38,470
It's like too strange.

3219
03:51:42,240 --> 03:51:43,220
Hold on, Snake!

3220
03:51:57,220 --> 03:51:57,980
Nice, Snake.

3221
03:51:58,000 --> 03:51:58,860
You're missing a boot.

3222
03:51:59,220 --> 03:52:00,200
Oh my god!

3223
03:52:02,160 --> 03:52:02,480
Uh oh.

3224
03:52:07,790 --> 03:52:08,710
Nice, nice.

3225
03:52:08,710 --> 03:52:08,750
Nice.

3226
03:52:46,590 --> 03:52:55,330
You know, they chose a scene in the trailer for Delta of him protecting Ocelot from the falling debris.

3227
03:52:55,450 --> 03:52:56,090
Do you understand?

3228
03:53:26,230 --> 03:53:27,430
I'm just shooting.

3229
03:53:28,030 --> 03:53:28,830
I'm just blasting.

3230
03:53:42,130 --> 03:53:43,530
I'm just blasting.

3231
03:53:43,530 --> 03:53:45,530
Oh, uh...

3232
03:53:47,850 --> 03:53:48,370
Thank

3233
03:53:59,630 --> 03:54:00,070
you, Eva.

3234
03:54:00,290 --> 03:54:01,210
She's so encouraging.

3235
03:54:05,770 --> 03:54:06,290
Nice.

3236
03:54:08,370 --> 03:54:10,170
Yeah, I got it, Eva.

3237
03:54:11,830 --> 03:54:13,830
Cinematic camera angles, baby!

3238
03:54:24,530 --> 03:54:25,050
Yippee!

3239
03:54:27,130 --> 03:54:28,090
Can't hit anything.

3240
03:54:28,190 --> 03:54:29,170
Eva, keep it up!

3241
03:54:30,270 --> 03:54:32,190
She's a pacifist, you guys.

3242
03:54:32,270 --> 03:54:32,950
Don't you know?

3243
03:54:33,990 --> 03:54:35,510
She's a pacifist.

3244
03:54:36,070 --> 03:54:37,310
She's like, oh yeah.

3245
03:54:37,910 --> 03:54:39,290
Don't kill them, Snake.

3246
03:55:00,730 --> 03:55:01,110
Nice.

3247
03:55:01,410 --> 03:55:02,150
I'm showing off.

3248
03:55:02,550 --> 03:55:03,610
Turn around, Snake.

3249
03:55:03,690 --> 03:55:04,030
Don't stop.

3250
03:55:16,180 --> 03:55:17,920
Why does the Shagohot have drill arms?

3251
03:55:21,420 --> 03:55:23,680
It's like a little... It's like a beaver.

3252
03:55:23,780 --> 03:55:24,320
Not a beaver.

3253
03:55:24,880 --> 03:55:25,800
A groundhog.

3254
03:55:37,970 --> 03:55:39,430
OK, Shagohot is pretty cute.

3255
03:55:44,930 --> 03:55:46,830
Oh my god, she's doing the work for me.

3256
03:55:46,830 --> 03:55:48,330
Thanks, Shagohot!

3257
03:55:52,470 --> 03:55:54,870
For the same reason anime girls have drill hair.

3258
03:55:54,970 --> 03:55:55,730
Because it's cute.

3259
03:55:57,990 --> 03:55:58,730
Shagohot is cute.

3260
03:55:58,830 --> 03:56:00,270
Oh, also for this thing too.

3261
03:56:00,390 --> 03:56:01,410
Make it go really fast.

3262
03:56:01,670 --> 03:56:03,330
That's what the drill arms are for.

3263
03:56:10,160 --> 03:56:13,100
Eva, we might want to get out of the way.

3264
03:56:13,540 --> 03:56:14,140
I'm just saying.

3265
03:56:15,400 --> 03:56:17,100
Eva, we might...

3266
03:56:17,100 --> 03:56:18,080
What a mood.

3267
03:56:18,620 --> 03:56:20,820
We might want to get out of the way, Eva.

3268
03:56:23,060 --> 03:56:23,620
Can't

3269
03:56:44,000 --> 03:56:45,240
get a single bike.

3270
03:56:55,530 --> 03:56:56,830
Just a little up, Snake.

3271
03:56:57,290 --> 03:56:58,030
There we go.

3272
03:56:59,650 --> 03:57:00,210
Oh,

3273
03:57:07,120 --> 03:57:08,440
there's several more guys.

3274
03:57:08,840 --> 03:57:09,560
Oh man.

3275
03:57:09,980 --> 03:57:11,780
Oh my god, these camera angles are crazy.

3276
03:57:12,620 --> 03:57:12,780
I'm

3277
03:57:23,460 --> 03:57:26,760
saying everything and nothing!

3278
03:57:40,000 --> 03:57:41,300
That's the American way.

3279
03:57:41,300 --> 03:57:43,260
I have the Star Trooper!

3280
03:58:01,630 --> 03:58:03,010
Slowly but surely.

3281
03:58:17,250 --> 03:58:18,370
Arsemity screws.

3282
03:58:18,710 --> 03:58:20,210
They work on water and ice.

3283
03:58:20,930 --> 03:58:25,450
The idea is that they can use the Shagohot anywhere.

3284
03:58:25,790 --> 03:58:26,790
Even on lakes, I think.

3285
03:58:29,110 --> 03:58:30,270
Watch out!

3286
03:58:37,700 --> 03:58:38,800
He's so big.

3287
03:58:44,320 --> 03:58:49,940
I love Josh Keaton's performance in this game so much.

3288
03:58:50,580 --> 03:58:52,260
It's everything I could hope for.

3289
03:58:53,340 --> 03:58:54,080
Again!

3290
03:58:54,440 --> 03:58:54,440
Again!

3291
03:59:07,380 --> 03:59:08,660
Nice, good job.

3292
03:59:11,580 --> 03:59:13,080
OK, just like...

3293
03:59:14,520 --> 03:59:15,280
Eva,

3294
03:59:21,850 --> 03:59:22,650
I'm scared!

3295
03:59:25,960 --> 03:59:27,880
OK, so this is the...

3296
03:59:27,880 --> 03:59:28,820
One moment.

3297
03:59:29,600 --> 03:59:30,000
I

3298
03:59:38,180 --> 03:59:40,500
don't have any RPG.

3299
03:59:40,820 --> 03:59:42,520
I don't even have that, do I?

3300
03:59:43,780 --> 03:59:44,940
When did I get an RPG?

3301
03:59:54,940 --> 03:59:56,960
In the cutscene.

3302
04:00:11,970 --> 04:00:13,170
Watch out, Ocelot!

3303
04:00:13,250 --> 04:00:14,130
Sorry if I hit you!

3304
04:00:17,030 --> 04:00:17,590
No, I'm not!

3305
04:00:27,800 --> 04:00:28,900
I don't know where I'm supposed to go.

3306
04:00:31,440 --> 04:00:32,600
Now we made it.

3307
04:00:33,260 --> 04:00:34,060
Shoot the treads.

3308
04:00:34,260 --> 04:00:35,780
Oh, I was shooting the little wheelies.

3309
04:00:35,900 --> 04:00:37,240
The little...whatever.

3310
04:00:39,640 --> 04:00:40,520
It's all good, though.

3311
04:00:41,520 --> 04:00:44,660
This part is not super...you know.

3312
04:00:50,760 --> 04:00:53,360
Eva, floor it!

3313
04:00:55,960 --> 04:00:56,660
Nice.

3314
04:00:56,820 --> 04:00:57,560
Nice dodge.

3315
04:00:57,660 --> 04:00:58,300
Nice dodge.

3316
04:01:03,330 --> 04:01:05,780
This thing is so maneuverable.

3317
04:01:19,940 --> 04:01:21,160
The bridge.

3318
04:01:22,940 --> 04:01:23,620
Let's go.

3319
04:01:23,620 --> 04:01:26,180
Snake, we've only got one chance.

3320
04:01:26,520 --> 04:01:28,380
We'll lure him over towards the other side.

3321
04:01:28,460 --> 04:01:28,920
Oh, that's right.

3322
04:01:29,180 --> 04:01:31,200
When the Shagohata is on the bridge, shoot the explosives.

3323
04:01:31,860 --> 04:01:33,920
The bomb is planted on the strut of the bridge.

3324
04:01:40,320 --> 04:01:41,200
One chance!

3325
04:01:47,690 --> 04:01:48,970
Is it on the PS2 version?

3326
04:01:49,070 --> 04:01:50,410
Yeah, I'm playing the PS2 version now.

3327
04:01:58,700 --> 04:01:59,580
No pressure.

3328
04:01:59,920 --> 04:02:00,960
Just don't do it too early.

3329
04:02:00,960 --> 04:02:02,980
Of course, not too late.

3330
04:02:03,460 --> 04:02:04,940
We've got one chance.

3331
04:02:05,400 --> 04:02:08,500
And it will totally make a difference in this fight.

3332
04:02:09,020 --> 04:02:16,280
It will 100% mean that we win.

3333
04:02:17,220 --> 04:02:17,980
Definitively.

3334
04:02:20,140 --> 04:02:21,720
I hate this part.

3335
04:02:22,100 --> 04:02:23,440
Gives me such false hope.

3336
04:02:37,260 --> 04:02:39,080
All I see is boobies.

3337
04:02:45,150 --> 04:02:47,510
OK, it's on the strut.

3338
04:02:48,630 --> 04:02:49,010
Alright,

3339
04:02:52,330 --> 04:02:52,590
Snake.

3340
04:02:53,250 --> 04:02:54,850
Find it and shoot it.

3341
04:02:55,530 --> 04:02:56,290
It's...

3342
04:02:58,330 --> 04:02:59,350
It's... Where?

3343
04:03:02,130 --> 04:03:02,410
Hello?

3344
04:03:02,950 --> 04:03:03,370
Oh...

3345
04:03:17,700 --> 04:03:18,620
Where is it?

3346
04:03:18,680 --> 04:03:19,460
Oh, there it is.

3347
04:03:19,840 --> 04:03:20,220
Is it here?

3348
04:03:21,440 --> 04:03:22,700
OK, just tell me when it's here.

3349
04:03:24,260 --> 04:03:25,440
OK, tell me when.

3350
04:03:25,780 --> 04:03:26,180
Say when.

3351
04:03:27,200 --> 04:03:27,960
OK, thanks Eva.

3352
04:03:29,380 --> 04:03:30,040
Oh, shoot.

3353
04:03:30,340 --> 04:03:32,280
I shot it!

3354
04:04:13,630 --> 04:04:15,450
Asalatsu's face is not looking so great.

3355
04:04:15,450 --> 04:04:16,870
Yeah, we did it!

3356
04:04:16,870 --> 04:04:19,130
We don't have to fight him now!

3357
04:04:38,150 --> 04:04:39,190
Yeah, it's over.

3358
04:04:39,830 --> 04:04:40,730
Said everybody.

3359
04:04:41,750 --> 04:04:42,870
When it's actually over.

3360
04:04:55,020 --> 04:04:57,040
This powerpuff girl's music.

3361
04:05:14,150 --> 04:05:14,670
And

3362
04:05:26,310 --> 04:05:29,490
I'm going to stay on the bike the entire time!

3363
04:05:44,310 --> 04:05:45,110
For luck.

3364
04:05:51,220 --> 04:05:52,440
Guys, she kissed me.

3365
04:05:52,560 --> 04:05:53,160
Did you see that?

3366
04:05:53,420 --> 04:05:54,020
P.O.V.

3367
04:05:54,340 --> 04:05:55,200
Eva kisses you.

3368
04:06:01,920 --> 04:06:02,800
So awesome.

3369
04:06:03,040 --> 04:06:04,860
Oh my God, the music is so awesome!

3370
04:06:07,720 --> 04:06:08,500
OK, hold on.

3371
04:06:10,320 --> 04:06:11,740
I must say...

3372
04:06:13,680 --> 04:06:15,860
Yes, Eva... I mean Paramedic.

3373
04:06:16,000 --> 04:06:16,400
Sorry.

3374
04:06:16,400 --> 04:06:18,060
I'm so used to saying Eva's name.

3375
04:06:18,320 --> 04:06:19,860
Just in case something happens.

3376
04:06:19,920 --> 04:06:20,860
What if I lose power?

3377
04:06:21,020 --> 04:06:21,400
I don't know.

3378
04:06:21,480 --> 04:06:22,060
I'm scared.

3379
04:06:26,120 --> 04:06:27,220
Eva on the mine.

3380
04:06:27,320 --> 04:06:28,540
I can't help it.

3381
04:06:29,040 --> 04:06:30,480
She just gave me a big ol' smooch.

3382
04:06:32,620 --> 04:06:35,120
Alright Paramedic, what movie are you going to tell us about?

3383
04:06:35,740 --> 04:06:39,840
While we are mid-combat with a pseudo-Metal Gear.

3384
04:06:40,600 --> 04:06:41,120
Good luck.

3385
04:06:46,400 --> 04:06:49,660
The rear frame of the Shagohod was destroyed when the bridge collapsed.

3386
04:06:50,160 --> 04:06:52,220
The back side of the front frame is now exposed.

3387
04:06:52,300 --> 04:06:53,220
Get in the butt!

3388
04:06:53,540 --> 04:06:57,220
Even the Shagohod is bound to have less armor plating on its back side.

3389
04:06:57,820 --> 04:07:00,400
I'm sure you can penetrate it with the RPG-7.

3390
04:07:00,520 --> 04:07:01,160
In the butt.

3391
04:07:01,260 --> 04:07:04,840
Attack the Shagohod from behind with the RPG-7.

3392
04:07:04,940 --> 04:07:05,600
Got it.

3393
04:07:07,860 --> 04:07:09,420
The Shagohod's weapons are deadly.

3394
04:07:09,680 --> 04:07:12,260
You're likely to get seriously hurt if you get caught in its sights.

3395
04:07:12,260 --> 04:07:16,280
If you get injured, go into the survival view and take care of it immediately.

3396
04:07:20,260 --> 04:07:22,280
The machine gun on that thing is deadly.

3397
04:07:22,620 --> 04:07:27,480
But you can force him to break off his attack by firing the RPG-7 at the body of the Shagohod.

3398
04:07:28,040 --> 04:07:33,680
If he starts strafing you with the machine gun, pump a rocket into the Shagohod before you get turned into Swiss cheese.

3399
04:07:33,800 --> 04:07:37,880
OK I don't like this fight.

3400
04:07:38,460 --> 04:07:39,580
Switch to the sneak suit.

3401
04:07:39,680 --> 04:07:39,980
Yeah.

3402
04:07:39,980 --> 04:07:42,520
We're gonna switch to that.

3403
04:07:43,880 --> 04:07:47,480
Cause we're gonna be needing its little abilities.

3404
04:07:49,640 --> 04:07:51,240
Guess we don't need...

3405
04:07:51,240 --> 04:07:53,660
If only he would just not shoot at me, huh?

3406
04:07:55,080 --> 04:07:55,540
OK

3407
04:08:28,020 --> 04:08:29,300
Did you?

3408
04:08:47,840 --> 04:08:48,480
Ah!

3409
04:08:49,720 --> 04:08:51,180
Where's the bag?

3410
04:08:51,640 --> 04:08:52,820
Eva, get me to the bag, please.

3411
04:08:54,100 --> 04:08:54,620
OK.

3412
04:08:54,620 --> 04:08:56,340
I actually am wasting my ammo.

3413
04:08:58,260 --> 04:08:59,120
Oh, there it is.

3414
04:08:59,220 --> 04:08:59,660
There it is.

3415
04:09:00,000 --> 04:09:00,240
No!

3416
04:09:09,200 --> 04:09:11,460
Eva, I need you to get me to the bag.

3417
04:09:11,940 --> 04:09:12,320
Eva!

3418
04:09:14,260 --> 04:09:14,780
Eva!

3419
04:09:38,720 --> 04:09:39,480
Swiss cheese!

3420
04:09:48,080 --> 04:09:49,120
Swiss cheese!

3421
04:09:49,480 --> 04:09:50,240
Swiss cheese!

3422
04:10:05,740 --> 04:10:06,880
Get us to the bag.

3423
04:10:06,940 --> 04:10:07,540
There we go.

3424
04:10:35,460 --> 04:10:35,880
Madrid!

3425
04:10:36,980 --> 04:10:38,300
Wait, Eva, can you please?

3426
04:10:38,660 --> 04:10:38,920
Eva.

3427
04:10:39,860 --> 04:10:40,420
Eva!

3428
04:11:25,830 --> 04:11:27,930
Why is he getting invincibility frames?

3429
04:11:28,490 --> 04:11:29,010
Please!

3430
04:11:30,070 --> 04:11:30,550
Yippee!

3431
04:11:31,890 --> 04:11:34,110
Alright, phase one down, baby.

3432
04:11:35,230 --> 04:11:35,570
OK

3433
04:11:41,640 --> 04:11:43,240
I hate this part, though.

3434
04:11:44,740 --> 04:11:46,220
I hate this part.

3435
04:11:48,560 --> 04:11:49,040
No.

3436
04:11:51,940 --> 04:11:53,620
I hate this part.

3437
04:11:58,920 --> 04:11:59,760
The turrets.

3438
04:11:59,860 --> 04:12:01,180
Yeah, but I'm not good at using those.

3439
04:12:01,880 --> 04:12:04,900
I don't quite remember what's like the best way to do this one.

3440
04:12:06,980 --> 04:12:09,320
Yeah, phase two is rough.

3441
04:12:11,480 --> 04:12:14,060
If you get the Mosin-3 headshots, you're deadly.

3442
04:12:14,200 --> 04:12:14,380
Really?

3443
04:12:14,920 --> 04:12:15,960
OK, let's try it.

3444
04:12:17,860 --> 04:12:18,820
The sniper?

3445
04:12:19,000 --> 04:12:19,180
OK.

3446
04:12:19,180 --> 04:12:21,320
I'll do my best.

3447
04:12:22,160 --> 04:12:24,280
Luckily, phase one isn't so bad.

3448
04:12:25,340 --> 04:12:26,720
Look at that ass!

3449
04:12:36,480 --> 04:12:38,240
Shooting the frogs on the...

3450
04:12:38,240 --> 04:12:42,340
I hate this idea, Eva.

3451
04:12:42,500 --> 04:12:44,180
I absolutely hate it.

3452
04:12:47,160 --> 04:12:49,700
Eva, you annoy me so much here.

3453
04:12:52,420 --> 04:12:52,860
No!

3454
04:12:58,300 --> 04:12:59,540
Watch the pinkies!

3455
04:13:03,240 --> 04:13:04,360
I love this part.

3456
04:13:06,780 --> 04:13:07,220
Yeah!

3457
04:13:07,500 --> 04:13:08,520
You tell him, Eva!

3458
04:13:08,640 --> 04:13:09,280
You tell him!

3459
04:13:14,920 --> 04:13:17,260
OK, I'm scared of this part, truly, you guys.

3460
04:13:17,320 --> 04:13:18,020
I'm so scared.

3461
04:13:19,420 --> 04:13:21,240
This part always gives me such pain.

3462
04:13:26,980 --> 04:13:29,020
Come on snake!

3463
04:13:29,200 --> 04:13:32,900
Snake, this is our opportunity!

3464
04:13:40,660 --> 04:13:41,540
Switch!

3465
04:13:41,920 --> 04:13:42,080
Switch!

3466
04:13:47,700 --> 04:13:48,580
Motion?

3467
04:13:53,020 --> 04:13:54,900
I can't unequip you.

3468
04:13:55,460 --> 04:13:57,900
Let's get rid of our Cigar Gas Spray.

3469
04:13:58,740 --> 04:14:00,740
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3470
04:14:00,820 --> 04:14:02,900
We have two more bosses after this.

3471
04:14:07,100 --> 04:14:08,560
We have two more.

3472
04:14:10,860 --> 04:14:12,400
Unequip the fork, you animal.

3473
04:14:12,540 --> 04:14:12,840
No!

3474
04:14:12,940 --> 04:14:13,580
I'm hungry!

3475
04:14:14,940 --> 04:14:15,620
One more?

3476
04:14:16,480 --> 04:14:18,020
We got two more.

3477
04:14:19,260 --> 04:14:20,740
We got two more.

3478
04:14:21,700 --> 04:14:25,720
Don't you know that escort missions are impossible themselves?

3479
04:14:27,900 --> 04:14:30,260
I'm calling the escort a boss.

3480
04:14:35,790 --> 04:14:37,110
Unequip the rotten food.

3481
04:14:37,310 --> 04:14:38,730
We can get rid of that too, can't we?

3482
04:14:39,490 --> 04:14:40,230
But it's OK.

3483
04:14:40,330 --> 04:14:41,730
I have everything that I need right now.

3484
04:14:42,810 --> 04:14:43,090
Alright.

3485
04:14:49,220 --> 04:14:50,180
Oh gosh!

3486
04:14:52,240 --> 04:14:52,880
Oh my God.

3487
04:14:58,990 --> 04:15:01,070
Oh God, he's really fast, guys.

3488
04:15:02,030 --> 04:15:02,530
Oh my gosh.

3489
04:15:02,710 --> 04:15:03,070
Oh God.

3490
04:15:04,130 --> 04:15:06,150
Eva, just keep at him, please!

3491
04:15:08,590 --> 04:15:10,650
Just keep at him, please!

3492
04:15:10,930 --> 04:15:11,410
Oh my God.

3493
04:15:11,650 --> 04:15:12,530
Oh gosh!

3494
04:15:14,930 --> 04:15:16,070
So bad.

3495
04:15:21,320 --> 04:15:24,220
I can't...I'm seeing the sky.

3496
04:15:30,710 --> 04:15:34,090
Can I...also...can I still take out his...

3497
04:15:36,470 --> 04:15:37,230
OK.

3498
04:15:41,340 --> 04:15:42,060
The frames.

3499
04:15:46,080 --> 04:15:47,740
I don't think so.

3500
04:15:49,920 --> 04:15:50,640
Believe that.

3501
04:15:50,800 --> 04:15:51,520
OK, so we can.

3502
04:15:51,840 --> 04:15:52,400
Awesome.

3503
04:15:59,300 --> 04:16:00,420
A trench.

3504
04:16:03,900 --> 04:16:04,960
Is he avoiding?

3505
04:16:09,930 --> 04:16:11,950
Is he, like, dodging my attack?

3506
04:16:34,570 --> 04:16:37,770
Let's wait for him to do his little spin around.

3507
04:16:38,390 --> 04:16:41,770
Of course, this is not...you know.

3508
04:16:48,440 --> 04:16:49,080
Oh, please.

3509
04:16:53,080 --> 04:16:54,640
Will this count as a bag?

3510
04:17:07,640 --> 04:17:09,800
Eva, don't get...What are you doing?

3511
04:17:09,880 --> 04:17:10,140
Eva!

3512
04:17:10,840 --> 04:17:11,320
Eva!

3513
04:17:14,080 --> 04:17:14,560
Eva!

3514
04:17:15,960 --> 04:17:16,400
Eva!

3515
04:17:17,740 --> 04:17:18,460
Oh shit.

3516
04:17:18,680 --> 04:17:20,120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3517
04:17:20,340 --> 04:17:22,840
This is actually my...

3518
04:17:22,840 --> 04:17:23,560
OK, OK.

3519
04:17:23,560 --> 04:17:23,660
OK.

3520
04:17:26,540 --> 04:17:31,740
Can you, like, not stop...start attacking me until, like, I...

3521
04:17:31,740 --> 04:17:34,180
start getting hits on you first, you know?

3522
04:17:43,900 --> 04:17:45,940
Eva, you were supposed to be distracting him!

3523
04:18:04,720 --> 04:18:05,840
So unfair.

3524
04:18:12,920 --> 04:18:13,480
Burn.

3525
04:18:17,330 --> 04:18:17,910
What was that?

3526
04:18:17,990 --> 04:18:18,270
Ointment?

3527
04:18:37,150 --> 04:18:38,310
I...notice me, right?

3528
04:18:43,440 --> 04:18:45,460
Can you, like, stop viewing me first?

3529
04:18:45,560 --> 04:18:46,380
Oh, that's a...

3530
04:18:46,960 --> 04:18:47,500
Oh my god.

3531
04:18:48,120 --> 04:18:49,440
Oh my god.

3532
04:18:50,440 --> 04:18:51,000
Eva!

3533
04:18:51,700 --> 04:18:53,060
Please do something!

3534
04:19:01,040 --> 04:19:01,600
She

3535
04:19:10,070 --> 04:19:11,130
did something, you guys.

3536
04:19:11,210 --> 04:19:11,910
She did something.

3537
04:19:12,150 --> 04:19:12,750
OK, OK.

3538
04:19:13,410 --> 04:19:14,530
Oh my god.

3539
04:19:24,190 --> 04:19:25,310
My gosh.

3540
04:19:25,690 --> 04:19:26,730
She did something.

3541
04:19:27,890 --> 04:19:29,510
She did do something.

3542
04:19:30,190 --> 04:19:31,630
Good job, Eva!

3543
04:19:34,550 --> 04:19:35,050
OK.

3544
04:19:37,700 --> 04:19:38,340
I don't care.

3545
04:19:38,780 --> 04:19:39,890
I don't care about...

3546
04:19:40,620 --> 04:19:41,520
Oh my god, wait.

3547
04:19:44,680 --> 04:19:45,180
We got him!

3548
04:19:45,240 --> 04:19:45,640
We got him!

3549
04:19:47,060 --> 04:19:47,560
Nice.

3550
04:19:48,780 --> 04:19:50,320
Oh, that did mega damage.

3551
04:19:52,900 --> 04:19:53,900
DD Megadoodoo.

3552
04:20:03,170 --> 04:20:05,110
Just gonna keep running around until he wins the

3553
04:20:19,060 --> 04:20:19,280
game.

3554
04:20:19,520 --> 04:20:21,080
Go back to Eva, please.

3555
04:20:22,320 --> 04:20:23,320
Eva, don't run me over.

3556
04:20:24,660 --> 04:20:26,000
Eva, don't run...

3557
04:20:29,000 --> 04:20:30,060
How'd that get me?

3558
04:20:30,160 --> 04:20:30,540
I don't know.

3559
04:20:34,500 --> 04:20:35,480
What else do I need?

3560
04:20:35,580 --> 04:20:36,180
Oh, the bandage.

3561
04:20:40,880 --> 04:20:42,740
I'm starting to think Eva is a double agent.

3562
04:20:42,740 --> 04:20:42,760
Double agent.

3563
04:20:49,300 --> 04:20:52,920
He eventually blows up the... What's it called?

3564
04:20:54,380 --> 04:20:56,180
The machine guns, I believe.

3565
04:20:57,920 --> 04:21:00,140
Don't get stuck on the fence!

3566
04:21:07,280 --> 04:21:09,040
Eva, Eva, Eva, Eva.

3567
04:21:09,160 --> 04:21:10,960
Eva, can I get back on your bike, please?

3568
04:21:11,920 --> 04:21:12,220
Eva!

3569
04:21:13,860 --> 04:21:14,380
Eva!

3570
04:21:14,380 --> 04:21:15,600
Eva, Eva.

3571
04:21:18,790 --> 04:21:22,170
Oh gosh.

3572
04:21:22,830 --> 04:21:24,730
That wasn't very kind of you.

3573
04:21:25,930 --> 04:21:28,370
That wasn't very kind of you, Volgin.

3574
04:21:34,030 --> 04:21:36,570
Let's run away while that's covering for me.

3575
04:21:37,130 --> 04:21:38,130
These eventually explode.

3576
04:21:38,270 --> 04:21:38,970
Oh, OK.

3577
04:21:39,870 --> 04:21:40,470
This is fine.

3578
04:21:43,690 --> 04:21:44,250
Eva,

3579
04:21:53,050 --> 04:21:53,950
someone can just hit you.

3580
04:21:54,930 --> 04:21:55,330
Again.

3581
04:22:09,230 --> 04:22:10,510
Doing your job.

3582
04:22:11,310 --> 04:22:12,190
Oh, I missed.

3583
04:22:12,890 --> 04:22:13,170
My bad.

3584
04:22:13,770 --> 04:22:14,270
Don't mind me.

3585
04:22:20,720 --> 04:22:21,340
Sorry, Eva.

3586
04:22:24,080 --> 04:22:25,440
Give it up on tranking him.

3587
04:22:25,560 --> 04:22:26,340
Yeah, it's OK.

3588
04:22:26,480 --> 04:22:27,040
I don't need to.

3589
04:22:36,820 --> 04:22:38,480
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

3590
04:22:39,260 --> 04:22:39,620
Oh my god.

3591
04:23:11,540 --> 04:23:12,420
First try, baby!

3592
04:23:28,100 --> 04:23:28,840
Cool, bye.

3593
04:23:29,240 --> 04:23:30,000
Cool, bye.

3594
04:23:33,020 --> 04:23:35,720
You're a little trickster, you, Volgin.

3595
04:23:38,960 --> 04:23:41,860
Yeah, I want to see you use your lightning powers in the rain.

3596
04:23:44,620 --> 04:23:46,060
I think you are!

3597
04:23:46,680 --> 04:23:49,060
I think you're the one afraid of a little thunder.

3598
04:23:49,620 --> 04:23:50,620
You little baby.

3599
04:23:51,120 --> 04:23:52,740
You're always trying to ward it off.

3600
04:23:53,820 --> 04:23:54,580
Phase 3.

3601
04:24:04,240 --> 04:24:06,880
Eva's surprised Pikachu face is too good.

3602
04:24:07,920 --> 04:24:09,520
He catches on fire.

3603
04:24:14,680 --> 04:24:17,260
Oh my god, all the bullets exploding into him.

3604
04:24:17,300 --> 04:24:17,980
That's crazy!

3605
04:24:23,230 --> 04:24:25,110
Such a lust for revenge.

3606
04:24:26,730 --> 04:24:27,370
Him!

3607
04:24:33,700 --> 04:24:35,080
They just keep going.

3608
04:24:36,000 --> 04:24:38,040
I think we might want to stay away from him.

3609
04:24:40,760 --> 04:24:42,640
What a way to go.

3610
04:24:46,340 --> 04:24:49,280
Guys, we did it!

3611
04:24:55,460 --> 04:24:59,660
Oh my gosh, fireworks!

3612
04:24:59,760 --> 04:25:00,200
Yippee!

3613
04:25:00,200 --> 04:25:00,300
Yippee!

3614
04:25:03,890 --> 04:25:07,320
This guy's body is literally exploding and we're like...

3615
04:25:07,320 --> 04:25:09,060
Happy 4th of July!

3616
04:25:09,580 --> 04:25:10,740
Happy New Year!

3617
04:25:28,470 --> 04:25:31,610
Does the Volgin camo work again here?

3618
04:25:35,470 --> 04:25:36,150
Lucky!

3619
04:25:41,480 --> 04:25:42,400
Bye Volgin!

3620
04:25:43,940 --> 04:25:45,640
See you again never.

3621
04:25:46,340 --> 04:25:47,060
Yeah, it works.

3622
04:25:47,200 --> 04:25:47,500
Perfect.

3623
04:25:48,820 --> 04:25:50,300
Let's change into that.

3624
04:25:51,360 --> 04:25:52,480
They fly now?

3625
04:25:52,560 --> 04:25:53,460
Oh, they've been flying.

3626
04:25:55,020 --> 04:25:56,300
I killed a guy like that.

3627
04:25:56,720 --> 04:25:58,360
I put him to sleep.

3628
04:26:01,080 --> 04:26:02,200
One moment.

3629
04:26:03,500 --> 04:26:04,180
Camouflage.

3630
04:26:04,180 --> 04:26:04,280
Camouflage.

3631
04:26:08,720 --> 04:26:10,000
You guys...

3632
04:26:10,000 --> 04:26:12,720
Oh, and let's switch out our weapons.

3633
04:26:13,080 --> 04:26:15,040
Let's go back to the M60.

3634
04:26:15,220 --> 04:26:16,340
Oh, my bad.

3635
04:26:16,860 --> 04:26:19,180
Let's go back to...

3636
04:26:20,940 --> 04:26:22,780
We'll unequip these for now.

3637
04:26:30,010 --> 04:26:32,630
What if we kiss in front of the exploding Russian?

3638
04:26:33,810 --> 04:26:34,950
Back to Fork?

3639
04:26:34,990 --> 04:26:35,410
Always!

3640
04:26:36,050 --> 04:26:38,270
I always have my Fork equipped.

3641
04:26:48,800 --> 04:26:50,800
So cinematic.

3642
04:26:51,880 --> 04:26:53,240
Oh, my gosh.

3643
04:26:53,600 --> 04:26:55,180
I can't see anything.

3644
04:26:55,480 --> 04:26:58,860
You guys, this motion blur is actually insane.

3645
04:26:59,480 --> 04:27:00,960
I can't see...

3646
04:27:03,820 --> 04:27:08,260
Oh, my God.

3647
04:27:09,060 --> 04:27:10,840
Holy motion blur.

3648
04:27:10,840 --> 04:27:12,320
For real though.

3649
04:27:12,780 --> 04:27:13,920
It's so bad.

3650
04:27:16,460 --> 04:27:17,700
Are they in front of us now?

3651
04:27:27,730 --> 04:27:29,670
These camera angles are killing me.

3652
04:27:29,750 --> 04:27:30,430
They are so funny.

3653
04:27:37,900 --> 04:27:39,620
Did you hear him in the distance?

3654
04:27:49,460 --> 04:27:53,180
Somewhere out there a snake is going...

3655
04:27:55,040 --> 04:27:58,320
Oh, my gosh.

3656
04:27:58,540 --> 04:27:59,080
Where are they?

3657
04:28:02,220 --> 04:28:03,240
In front of us?

3658
04:28:05,240 --> 04:28:06,760
Enemy sighted!

3659
04:28:25,180 --> 04:28:26,580
Let's just sit forward.

3660
04:28:28,660 --> 04:28:29,140
Ah...

3661
04:28:33,200 --> 04:28:34,780
Snake, where are you shooting at?

3662
04:28:34,940 --> 04:28:40,700
That's the one thing about these camera angles is that I literally can't tell where I'm shooting at.

3663
04:28:44,140 --> 04:28:46,060
Rain muffled his last rhyme.

3664
04:28:49,000 --> 04:28:50,120
Oh, my gosh.

3665
04:28:50,160 --> 04:28:50,760
Oh, gosh.

3666
04:28:50,800 --> 04:28:51,460
I can't see anything.

3667
04:28:52,180 --> 04:28:53,000
Oh, my God.

3668
04:28:53,000 --> 04:28:53,760
I can't see anything.

3669
04:28:56,800 --> 04:28:59,540
I can't... Oh, my gosh.

3670
04:29:02,160 --> 04:29:02,760
Damn it.

3671
04:29:06,980 --> 04:29:08,800
I don't know if I'm shooting, if I'm hitting.

3672
04:29:09,400 --> 04:29:10,880
I know they told me to use first person.

3673
04:29:11,040 --> 04:29:12,060
Fine, I'll use first person.

3674
04:29:15,340 --> 04:29:15,900
Oh, my God.

3675
04:29:17,400 --> 04:29:18,020
Damn it.

3676
04:29:22,790 --> 04:29:23,370
Me too.

3677
04:29:23,490 --> 04:29:26,880
I can't even hit shit.

3678
04:29:27,220 --> 04:29:27,960
I can't aim.

3679
04:29:30,340 --> 04:29:31,200
Where are you guys?

3680
04:29:31,200 --> 04:29:31,240
Where are you guys?

3681
04:29:31,720 --> 04:29:34,240
Oh, my

3682
04:29:42,320 --> 04:29:42,660
God.

3683
04:29:44,120 --> 04:29:44,880
Where are you?

3684
04:29:51,570 --> 04:29:53,530
I can't even tell where I'm shooting.

3685
04:29:53,890 --> 04:29:54,450
I'll be honest.

3686
04:29:55,210 --> 04:29:56,190
I don't even know.

3687
04:30:01,540 --> 04:30:02,960
Where is the log?

3688
04:30:03,580 --> 04:30:04,840
I'm shooting the log, Eva!

3689
04:30:05,360 --> 04:30:06,140
I'm shooting the log.

3690
04:30:06,260 --> 04:30:06,720
I got it.

3691
04:30:14,070 --> 04:30:15,350
Where are the other guys?

3692
04:30:16,510 --> 04:30:17,250
Damn it.

3693
04:30:22,240 --> 04:30:22,700
Whatever.

3694
04:30:22,700 --> 04:30:22,800
Whatever.

3695
04:30:25,680 --> 04:30:27,680
Oh, can you use the size of the M63?

3696
04:30:27,800 --> 04:30:29,120
It's all too craziness.

3697
04:30:29,620 --> 04:30:30,840
It's all too craziness.

3698
04:30:30,940 --> 04:30:34,700
It can't even... The motion blur plus the recoil plus...

3699
04:30:35,980 --> 04:30:38,500
Everything is just making it impossible for me.

3700
04:30:41,720 --> 04:30:42,460
Oh, my God.

3701
04:30:42,520 --> 04:30:44,340
These camera angles are killing me.

3702
04:30:46,360 --> 04:30:47,080
Oh, my God.

3703
04:30:47,100 --> 04:30:50,500
These are the old camera angles, which are great, but like...

3704
04:30:50,500 --> 04:30:52,820
Holy moly.

3705
04:30:53,020 --> 04:30:55,120
It is... Oh, my God.

3706
04:30:55,180 --> 04:30:56,380
I can't see anything.

3707
04:30:58,860 --> 04:30:59,840
Are there people?

3708
04:31:00,560 --> 04:31:01,120
I don't think so.

3709
04:31:01,140 --> 04:31:01,780
Oh, yes there are.

3710
04:31:07,140 --> 04:31:10,480
I can't see where I'm shooting because I don't know which direction I'm going.

3711
04:31:10,580 --> 04:31:12,380
Sometimes when the camera angle changes...

3712
04:31:12,380 --> 04:31:15,060
Am I shooting... Am I shooting to the left?

3713
04:31:15,120 --> 04:31:15,920
Am I shooting to the right?

3714
04:31:16,040 --> 04:31:16,720
I don't know.

3715
04:31:16,800 --> 04:31:18,680
The camera angle just changes so much.

3716
04:31:19,000 --> 04:31:20,220
Everything is wild!

3717
04:31:27,470 --> 04:31:28,850
Everything is too crazy!

3718
04:31:33,410 --> 04:31:34,690
Can I... Am I shooting anybody?

3719
04:31:34,770 --> 04:31:35,570
I can't even tell.

3720
04:31:36,430 --> 04:31:38,370
I think I'm getting them eventually.

3721
04:31:41,230 --> 04:31:41,670
Eventually.

3722
04:31:42,810 --> 04:31:43,410
Oh, my God.

3723
04:31:43,470 --> 04:31:44,150
Where are they now?

3724
04:31:44,250 --> 04:31:45,070
Nobody knows.

3725
04:31:47,470 --> 04:31:48,630
Am I shooting straight?

3726
04:31:48,830 --> 04:31:49,590
I don't know.

3727
04:31:50,190 --> 04:31:52,730
Do I move my analog stick to the left or the right?

3728
04:31:52,790 --> 04:31:53,670
I have no idea!

3729
04:31:57,370 --> 04:31:57,970
Eva!

3730
04:31:58,070 --> 04:31:58,070
Eva.

3731
04:31:58,210 --> 04:31:58,850
Distant Eva.

3732
04:32:02,970 --> 04:32:04,550
Oh, my gosh.

3733
04:32:06,330 --> 04:32:07,890
I can't hear you, Eva!

3734
04:32:08,010 --> 04:32:09,010
You're all the way over there!

3735
04:32:15,870 --> 04:32:19,050
This is so insanity.

3736
04:32:19,570 --> 04:32:21,370
It's just...

3737
04:32:21,370 --> 04:32:22,750
I don't know.

3738
04:32:23,190 --> 04:32:23,670
Oh, no.

3739
04:32:23,670 --> 04:32:24,490
I don't know.

3740
04:32:24,590 --> 04:32:26,570
Eva, you don't want to drive so fast in the forest.

3741
04:32:26,890 --> 04:32:27,650
Be careful.

3742
04:32:28,230 --> 04:32:28,570
Be careful.

3743
04:32:31,510 --> 04:32:33,450
Oh, no.

3744
04:32:34,990 --> 04:32:36,190
It's not my fault, is it?

3745
04:32:38,910 --> 04:32:39,810
It's your fault, Eva.

3746
04:32:39,950 --> 04:32:41,610
I had the good camo on.

3747
04:32:42,250 --> 04:32:42,610
Eva!

3748
04:32:50,480 --> 04:32:50,840
Eva!

3749
04:32:56,390 --> 04:32:57,510
Oh, gosh.

3750
04:32:57,990 --> 04:32:58,830
Snake, are you okay?

3751
04:33:01,810 --> 04:33:04,650
I didn't blow up the log.

3752
04:33:05,410 --> 04:33:06,870
It's my fault.

3753
04:33:07,670 --> 04:33:09,570
Legend has it that this RAW wasn't intended.

3754
04:33:09,730 --> 04:33:14,030
It was recorded on a hot mic after David Hayter was told he would have to record a MGS2 type codec.

3755
04:33:15,070 --> 04:33:16,390
Source sounds cool.

3756
04:33:17,510 --> 04:33:18,670
Eva, are you okay?

3757
04:33:20,270 --> 04:33:21,310
Oh, goodness.

3758
04:33:21,810 --> 04:33:22,610
You spooked me.

3759
04:33:22,770 --> 04:33:23,730
You're still alive.

3760
04:33:40,340 --> 04:33:41,180
Eva!

3761
04:33:43,020 --> 04:33:43,860
Eva.

3762
04:33:45,340 --> 04:33:46,180
Snake.

3763
04:33:46,600 --> 04:33:47,580
What an inconvenience.

3764
04:33:48,120 --> 04:33:48,840
How's it look?

3765
04:33:51,440 --> 04:33:53,120
Pretty bad.

3766
04:33:54,300 --> 04:33:56,620
Not a sensitive bone in your body.

3767
04:33:58,500 --> 04:33:59,180
Eva.

3768
04:34:00,100 --> 04:34:00,940
Eva.

3769
04:34:01,100 --> 04:34:02,080
What about you, Snake?

3770
04:34:02,560 --> 04:34:03,460
I'm fine.

3771
04:34:04,020 --> 04:34:04,900
That's good to hear.

3772
04:34:09,220 --> 04:34:09,660
No.

3773
04:34:09,660 --> 04:34:10,100
Goodbye.

3774
04:34:15,050 --> 04:34:15,790
Oh boy.

3775
04:34:16,190 --> 04:34:17,230
Boss number 2.

3776
04:34:17,590 --> 04:34:18,570
2 out of 4.

3777
04:34:18,990 --> 04:34:19,770
Wait, 3 out of 4.

3778
04:34:24,110 --> 04:34:24,550
Okay.

3779
04:34:30,530 --> 04:34:34,450
Hold on, I'm going to close my eyes and kind of Yume Joshi here a little bit, okay?

3780
04:34:35,230 --> 04:34:35,690
Is it alright?

3781
04:34:39,790 --> 04:34:40,810
What do you mean?

3782
04:34:51,630 --> 04:34:53,930
Say that one more time.

3783
04:35:02,530 --> 04:35:04,970
This guy is so stupid.

3784
04:35:09,390 --> 04:35:09,830
Oh.

3785
04:35:11,770 --> 04:35:12,870
Oh my god.

3786
04:35:16,850 --> 04:35:19,730
I guess so.

3787
04:35:20,050 --> 04:35:20,430
Alright.

3788
04:35:21,470 --> 04:35:22,350
Oh gosh.

3789
04:35:22,430 --> 04:35:22,750
Oh gosh.

3790
04:35:22,810 --> 04:35:23,110
Oh gosh.

3791
04:35:24,930 --> 04:35:25,990
Oh my god.

3792
04:35:26,070 --> 04:35:26,530
Eva, please.

3793
04:35:26,870 --> 04:35:27,250
Eva.

3794
04:35:27,650 --> 04:35:28,090
Eva.

3795
04:35:28,350 --> 04:35:28,350
Eva.

3796
04:35:29,230 --> 04:35:30,270
Oh my gosh.

3797
04:35:30,370 --> 04:35:34,510
We should have just torn off the stick and then walked with the stick in her body, right?

3798
04:35:34,690 --> 04:35:36,730
I feel like that would have been better to stop the bleeding.

3799
04:35:38,670 --> 04:35:38,990
Right?

3800
04:35:39,250 --> 04:35:41,670
If we tore the stick off and didn't just...

3801
04:35:43,570 --> 04:35:45,170
We should have cut it off.

3802
04:35:46,270 --> 04:35:47,070
Oh my god.

3803
04:35:47,090 --> 04:35:47,730
Oh my god, Eva.

3804
04:35:50,570 --> 04:35:51,050
Snake.

3805
04:35:54,590 --> 04:35:55,710
Now it's just open.

3806
04:36:02,090 --> 04:36:05,270
Snake, can you hear me?

3807
04:36:08,870 --> 04:36:09,450
Yeah.

3808
04:36:09,830 --> 04:36:10,950
End game tutorial.

3809
04:36:14,930 --> 04:36:16,090
Calm down.

3810
04:36:19,550 --> 04:36:22,030
Do you know about the easter egg with Eva?

3811
04:36:22,590 --> 04:36:23,870
I kind of.

3812
04:36:24,790 --> 04:36:27,790
I know about it, but I don't quite remember how to access it.

3813
04:36:27,890 --> 04:36:32,970
I think so.

3814
04:36:33,830 --> 04:36:34,410
Yeah.

3815
04:36:38,670 --> 04:36:39,170
Okay.

3816
04:36:41,190 --> 04:36:41,290
Yeah.

3817
04:36:47,810 --> 04:36:48,370
Okay.

3818
04:36:53,190 --> 04:36:55,170
Paramedic doesn't want any competition.

3819
04:37:03,470 --> 04:37:04,730
Eva's such a drama queen.

3820
04:37:04,970 --> 04:37:07,110
Being stabbed in the kidney makes her cough blood.

3821
04:37:12,030 --> 04:37:12,610
Cure.

3822
04:37:12,750 --> 04:37:12,950
Cure.

3823
04:37:13,030 --> 04:37:13,190
Cure.

3824
04:37:14,190 --> 04:37:15,230
Cure snake.

3825
04:37:15,850 --> 04:37:16,910
We gotta cut.

3826
04:37:18,090 --> 04:37:19,050
We gotta disinfect.

3827
04:37:21,030 --> 04:37:21,790
Oh my gosh.

3828
04:37:21,970 --> 04:37:23,570
What do you mean running short?

3829
04:37:23,750 --> 04:37:24,770
Snake, we are full.

3830
04:37:27,150 --> 04:37:28,650
What are you talking about?

3831
04:37:29,590 --> 04:37:30,510
I'm running low.

3832
04:37:30,830 --> 04:37:31,850
They gave us everything.

3833
04:37:33,490 --> 04:37:34,390
What else?

3834
04:37:34,610 --> 04:37:35,390
Not the ointment.

3835
04:37:35,810 --> 04:37:36,310
Switcher.

3836
04:37:42,110 --> 04:37:43,770
My favorite segment of the game.

3837
04:37:43,850 --> 04:37:46,210
I hope they implement this more in Delta.

3838
04:37:46,670 --> 04:37:49,490
Make this a 10 hour segment, please.

3839
04:37:50,450 --> 04:37:55,450
Guys, boss fight number 3 coming up.

3840
04:37:55,590 --> 04:37:57,030
Baby, love that.

3841
04:37:57,130 --> 04:37:58,550
Love that for us.

3842
04:37:59,090 --> 04:38:02,710
I love that for us.

3843
04:38:03,210 --> 04:38:04,350
What do I need?

3844
04:38:05,710 --> 04:38:06,430
Burn?

3845
04:38:07,150 --> 04:38:07,650
Wait, what?

3846
04:38:07,650 --> 04:38:09,350
Oh no bandage.

3847
04:38:09,470 --> 04:38:09,990
Bandage.

3848
04:38:10,590 --> 04:38:11,430
Where is the bandage?

3849
04:38:11,930 --> 04:38:12,650
Oh there it is.

3850
04:38:14,350 --> 04:38:16,430
Putting an escort mission right before the very end.

3851
04:38:16,510 --> 04:38:17,150
Why Kojima?

3852
04:38:17,290 --> 04:38:17,450
Why?

3853
04:38:20,250 --> 04:38:20,770
Eva.

3854
04:38:44,780 --> 04:38:46,620
They are so perky.

3855
04:38:58,360 --> 04:39:00,300
Look at them grippers.

3856
04:39:04,400 --> 04:39:06,700
How do I see her...

3857
04:39:08,220 --> 04:39:10,380
Her medical history.

3858
04:39:10,640 --> 04:39:11,540
Isn't that where it's at?

3859
04:39:12,060 --> 04:39:13,560
Like all the stuff that she's...

3860
04:39:13,560 --> 04:39:14,620
Check medical history.

3861
04:39:14,660 --> 04:39:15,440
How do I get to it?

3862
04:39:19,920 --> 04:39:20,440
R2?

3863
04:39:24,290 --> 04:39:24,890
No.

3864
04:39:26,450 --> 04:39:27,350
In surgery?

3865
04:39:27,810 --> 04:39:28,110
Here?

3866
04:39:29,530 --> 04:39:30,470
Where is it?

3867
04:39:30,470 --> 04:39:32,130
Finish the tutorial first.

3868
04:39:32,270 --> 04:39:33,790
OK, I'm getting ahead of myself.

3869
04:39:34,890 --> 04:39:36,270
I'm getting ahead of myself.

3870
04:39:38,610 --> 04:39:39,570
Bandage disinfectant.

3871
04:39:42,470 --> 04:39:42,950
R1?

3872
04:39:44,970 --> 04:39:45,570
Oh wait.

3873
04:39:47,590 --> 04:39:48,750
Oh my God.

3874
04:39:48,970 --> 04:39:49,170
Eva?

3875
04:39:49,570 --> 04:39:50,270
Are you OK?

3876
04:39:50,810 --> 04:39:51,890
Are you OK Eva?

3877
04:39:53,130 --> 04:39:54,050
Oh there it is.

3878
04:39:54,110 --> 04:39:54,410
There it is.

3879
04:39:54,410 --> 04:39:55,250
Thank you guys.

3880
04:39:56,890 --> 04:40:02,590
We got a cut, stab wound, gunshot wound, burn...

3881
04:40:03,490 --> 04:40:04,130
Proctitis.

3882
04:40:04,230 --> 04:40:04,810
What's that?

3883
04:40:04,930 --> 04:40:06,250
Lower back pain?

3884
04:40:06,650 --> 04:40:08,990
I mean that's just every lady isn't it?

3885
04:40:09,550 --> 04:40:12,290
Love a girl with a good set of bones.

3886
04:40:14,030 --> 04:40:16,210
Any skeletons in the chat?

3887
04:40:21,310 --> 04:40:26,390
Finger sprain, stomach ache, leech, broken nail.

3888
04:40:28,050 --> 04:40:29,110
Tummy hurt.

3889
04:40:29,430 --> 04:40:31,130
Can Eva barf if you spin her around?

3890
04:40:31,210 --> 04:40:31,770
I'm not sure.

3891
04:40:34,230 --> 04:40:35,670
Blow sustained.

3892
04:40:38,650 --> 04:40:40,090
Is that...

3893
04:40:44,610 --> 04:40:47,070
Together with the lower back pain?

3894
04:40:52,500 --> 04:40:55,440
Proctitis is inflammation of the rectum.

3895
04:40:59,600 --> 04:41:00,480
Electrical burn.

3896
04:41:00,640 --> 04:41:01,100
Blow sustained.

3897
04:41:02,100 --> 04:41:02,560
Hypoxia.

3898
04:41:02,940 --> 04:41:03,460
Blow sustained.

3899
04:41:03,560 --> 04:41:03,940
Blow sustained.

3900
04:41:05,380 --> 04:41:05,960
A cold.

3901
04:41:06,500 --> 04:41:07,160
Stomach ache.

3902
04:41:07,780 --> 04:41:08,340
Broken nail.

3903
04:41:08,400 --> 04:41:08,620
Cold.

3904
04:41:08,720 --> 04:41:09,140
Stomach ache.

3905
04:41:09,320 --> 04:41:10,200
Inner ear infection.

3906
04:41:10,400 --> 04:41:11,040
Oh that sucks.

3907
04:41:11,140 --> 04:41:11,660
A cavity.

3908
04:41:11,900 --> 04:41:12,200
Oh no.

3909
04:41:12,480 --> 04:41:13,440
Night terror.

3910
04:41:20,160 --> 04:41:20,620
Gastritis.

3911
04:41:20,800 --> 04:41:21,060
Stomach ache.

3912
04:41:21,080 --> 04:41:23,780
She's got a lot of tummy aches.

3913
04:41:25,740 --> 04:41:28,740
A breast enhancement.

3914
04:41:36,400 --> 04:41:38,340
That's why they're so perky.

3915
04:41:38,760 --> 04:41:39,480
You know what?

3916
04:41:39,520 --> 04:41:40,680
They look natural.

3917
04:41:41,100 --> 04:41:42,060
They look good.

3918
04:41:42,800 --> 04:41:43,640
Bronchitis.

3919
04:41:44,660 --> 04:41:47,280
Tick-borne encephalitis.

3920
04:41:48,400 --> 04:41:48,940
A cut.

3921
04:41:49,260 --> 04:41:50,080
Frostbite?

3922
04:41:50,440 --> 04:41:51,120
Eva how?

3923
04:41:51,800 --> 04:41:52,940
Stab wound spread.

3924
04:41:54,440 --> 04:42:00,020
What about the... Is the stab wound the tree maybe?

3925
04:42:00,260 --> 04:42:01,660
Let's see what she's got in her food history.

3926
04:42:01,760 --> 04:42:02,500
Instant noodles.

3927
04:42:02,680 --> 04:42:03,540
Some grappa.

3928
04:42:05,900 --> 04:42:07,660
I hardly even know her.

3929
04:42:09,940 --> 04:42:11,880
Grilled duck breast with herbs.

3930
04:42:12,000 --> 04:42:12,820
Gorgonzola cream.

3931
04:42:12,980 --> 04:42:13,960
She's eating good.

3932
04:42:13,960 --> 04:42:15,120
Fettuccine.

3933
04:42:15,960 --> 04:42:17,300
Some tea.

3934
04:42:17,500 --> 04:42:20,180
Tsuchinoko and shark fin soup.

3935
04:42:20,960 --> 04:42:22,680
She's eating good.

3936
04:42:23,800 --> 04:42:25,180
Cold vegetables.

3937
04:42:25,340 --> 04:42:25,700
Apple.

3938
04:42:27,020 --> 04:42:27,960
Instant noodles.

3939
04:42:28,480 --> 04:42:28,900
Coffee.

3940
04:42:30,420 --> 04:42:32,420
Gulova cream brulee.

3941
04:42:32,740 --> 04:42:34,460
With a milk sorbet.

3942
04:42:35,180 --> 04:42:37,120
Oh my gosh.

3943
04:42:37,400 --> 04:42:42,410
Oh my gosh.

3944
04:42:43,290 --> 04:42:45,370
Saffron soup style.

3945
04:42:46,330 --> 04:42:49,610
Duck foie gras sauteed in apple sauce.

3946
04:42:52,340 --> 04:42:53,420
Baguette.

3947
04:42:53,980 --> 04:42:55,900
She ate that mushroom.

3948
04:42:57,300 --> 04:42:58,800
She got the chilled ratatouille.

3949
04:43:05,800 --> 04:43:10,240
Fried with... Oyster mushroom fried with dandelions.

3950
04:43:10,340 --> 04:43:11,980
Oh my gosh, it's just non-stop.

3951
04:43:13,980 --> 04:43:18,820
I think she's eating better than I've ever eaten in my entire afterlife.

3952
04:43:21,700 --> 04:43:22,140
Wow.

3953
04:43:24,460 --> 04:43:25,740
Okay, I'll help you now, Eva.

3954
04:43:27,000 --> 04:43:29,380
She's suffering... Abdomen pierced by the tree branch.

3955
04:43:29,460 --> 04:43:30,280
Don't remember what you've got.

3956
04:43:30,360 --> 04:43:31,420
Okay, let's see.

3957
04:43:31,960 --> 04:43:33,500
We need to stop the bleeding.

3958
04:43:41,460 --> 04:43:41,900
Disinfecting.

3959
04:43:41,900 --> 04:43:42,340
Perfect.

3960
04:43:43,860 --> 04:43:44,360
Oh, spinner?

3961
04:43:44,360 --> 04:43:44,420
Spinner?

3962
04:43:47,380 --> 04:43:47,900
Oh wait.

3963
04:43:48,040 --> 04:43:50,260
Oh my gosh, I almost didn't notice.

3964
04:43:53,060 --> 04:43:53,420
Bleeding.

3965
04:44:04,980 --> 04:44:06,180
Maybe I can still do it.

3966
04:44:08,720 --> 04:44:10,760
I wouldn't have done it anyway because of the cutscene.

3967
04:44:11,420 --> 04:44:14,240
Snake's food history is like rat, rat, bat, frog.

3968
04:44:14,240 --> 04:44:16,980
I think so.

3969
04:44:20,200 --> 04:44:21,860
Starting to get sleepy, you guys.

3970
04:44:27,740 --> 04:44:29,240
Look at him.

3971
04:44:29,640 --> 04:44:33,560
He doesn't even have to do anything and he's just so calm and cool.

3972
04:44:52,820 --> 04:44:55,120
She's looking at him like, what the hell is the time?

3973
04:45:03,230 --> 04:45:04,930
It's now the time, I know.

3974
04:45:05,570 --> 04:45:07,730
But he's telling her something important!

3975
04:45:08,490 --> 04:45:10,590
She needs to use it, you know?

3976
04:45:12,770 --> 04:45:13,570
Okay, hold on.

3977
04:45:14,390 --> 04:45:14,950
Let's see.

3978
04:45:18,390 --> 04:45:20,450
Oh no, I can't go back to Eva, can I?

3979
04:45:20,750 --> 04:45:22,650
Wait, if I go to cure...Oh, there we go.

3980
04:45:36,630 --> 04:45:37,510
Whoa.

3981
04:45:41,660 --> 04:45:42,360
Yes?

3982
04:45:43,040 --> 04:45:43,940
I'm fine.

3983
04:45:44,440 --> 04:45:45,760
Yeah, I've been better.

3984
04:45:47,260 --> 04:45:51,020
She just barked all over the place.

3985
04:46:03,920 --> 04:46:04,620
Okay.

3986
04:46:04,620 --> 04:46:07,960
If I tell her to jump off a bridge too, will she do it?

3987
04:46:11,980 --> 04:46:12,980
But I'm like, hey Eva!

3988
04:46:15,280 --> 04:46:16,340
Let's go here.

3989
04:46:16,820 --> 04:46:17,560
She'll do it.

3990
04:46:18,880 --> 04:46:20,520
Eva doesn't seem very smart.

3991
04:46:21,700 --> 04:46:22,900
We're full on everything.

3992
04:46:23,040 --> 04:46:23,340
Crazy.

3993
04:46:24,740 --> 04:46:25,340
You okay, Eva?

3994
04:46:28,360 --> 04:46:29,840
God, she's so beautiful.

3995
04:46:30,580 --> 04:46:31,460
Don't die, Eva.

3996
04:46:31,560 --> 04:46:32,940
You're too hot to die, okay?

3997
04:46:32,940 --> 04:46:34,760
Look, she's recovering.

3998
04:46:34,840 --> 04:46:35,360
She's recovering.

3999
04:46:35,760 --> 04:46:36,660
Let's recover together.

4000
04:46:40,820 --> 04:46:41,680
Just woke up?

4001
04:46:42,780 --> 04:46:43,600
Oh, sorry.

4002
04:46:50,220 --> 04:46:51,080
I'm sore?

4003
04:46:51,260 --> 04:46:52,840
Thank you for doing the concert with me and the great UQ.

4004
04:46:53,240 --> 04:46:53,960
Thank you!

4005
04:46:59,740 --> 04:47:01,280
Eva, this is for my stamina.

4006
04:47:03,380 --> 04:47:04,700
Eva, this is for me.

4007
04:47:05,700 --> 04:47:08,020
I think you enjoy this, madam.

4008
04:47:08,680 --> 04:47:10,140
You've been all over me.

4009
04:47:10,560 --> 04:47:12,920
This entire time you've been all over Snake.

4010
04:47:14,060 --> 04:47:16,160
Oh my god, her stamina goes down crazy fast.

4011
04:47:16,240 --> 04:47:17,240
Let's feed her real quick.

4012
04:47:17,980 --> 04:47:21,280
What you like?

4013
04:47:22,960 --> 04:47:23,920
A rat.

4014
04:47:31,720 --> 04:47:33,260
Look with respect.

4015
04:47:34,260 --> 04:47:34,860
Alrighty.

4016
04:47:36,820 --> 04:47:40,840
If you really loved her, you would feed her a rat.

4017
04:47:43,600 --> 04:47:44,400
Alright, guys.

4018
04:47:44,540 --> 04:47:44,920
Whoa!

4019
04:47:45,220 --> 04:47:46,140
Holy framerate.

4020
04:47:46,260 --> 04:47:46,820
Oh my goodness.

4021
04:47:47,800 --> 04:47:49,840
Okay, I think we're... Oh, goodness.

4022
04:47:50,020 --> 04:47:51,420
What is... What's the framerate?

4023
04:47:52,240 --> 04:47:52,760
Alright, Eva.

4024
04:47:52,860 --> 04:47:54,360
Oh, let me change my... Wait!

4025
04:47:54,980 --> 04:47:57,960
If I'm wearing this, they still won't be able to shoot me, right?

4026
04:47:59,240 --> 04:47:59,680
So...

4027
04:47:59,680 --> 04:48:01,200
My PS2 is like...

4028
04:48:02,340 --> 04:48:03,220
The rain!

4029
04:48:12,630 --> 04:48:13,430
Any guys?

4030
04:48:14,210 --> 04:48:14,970
I don't know.

4031
04:48:15,090 --> 04:48:18,270
I don't remember where they're at, so...

4032
04:48:18,690 --> 04:48:20,750
They just point their guns and say, damn it.

4033
04:48:20,830 --> 04:48:21,150
Yeah.

4034
04:48:21,870 --> 04:48:22,630
They're so silly.

4035
04:48:25,330 --> 04:48:28,110
But then I still don't want to cause an alert, you know?

4036
04:48:29,770 --> 04:48:30,530
Oh, save.

4037
04:48:30,610 --> 04:48:30,910
Thank you.

4038
04:48:30,970 --> 04:48:31,330
Yeah, yeah.

4039
04:48:31,450 --> 04:48:32,110
Thank you so much.

4040
04:48:36,360 --> 04:48:38,900
Yeah, just in case my PS2 is just like...

4041
04:48:42,900 --> 04:48:44,000
Won't they still shoot Eva?

4042
04:48:44,080 --> 04:48:44,660
I guess you're right.

4043
04:48:44,940 --> 04:48:47,320
It's probably for the best that we don't wear it.

4044
04:48:49,940 --> 04:48:51,220
No guys still after cutscene?

4045
04:48:51,340 --> 04:48:51,780
Oh, okay.

4046
04:48:51,840 --> 04:48:52,180
Thank you.

4047
04:48:58,160 --> 04:48:59,520
We're so close to the end.

4048
04:48:59,620 --> 04:49:00,960
We're almost there.

4049
04:49:03,520 --> 04:49:05,360
Thank you, paramedic.

4050
04:49:06,060 --> 04:49:07,040
Thank you.

4051
04:49:08,900 --> 04:49:11,120
It's another easter egg if you feed Eva oodles... noodles.

4052
04:49:11,340 --> 04:49:11,560
Really?

4053
04:49:12,060 --> 04:49:12,900
Oodles and noodles.

4054
04:49:16,400 --> 04:49:17,960
But these are mine.

4055
04:49:23,830 --> 04:49:25,410
I just wasted them.

4056
04:49:27,430 --> 04:49:28,350
I just wasted them.

4057
04:49:29,370 --> 04:49:30,710
Why wouldn't it let me...

4058
04:49:37,940 --> 04:49:38,420
Oops.

4059
04:49:39,660 --> 04:49:40,620
The save.

4060
04:49:42,800 --> 04:49:43,860
Am I too far?

4061
04:49:43,940 --> 04:49:45,160
It wouldn't let me give it to...Oh.

4062
04:49:45,620 --> 04:49:46,420
Eva, come here.

4063
04:49:46,780 --> 04:49:47,520
What are you doing over there?

4064
04:49:50,260 --> 04:49:51,980
How do I get her to follow me?

4065
04:49:57,310 --> 04:49:58,010
Action button?

4066
04:50:01,700 --> 04:50:02,600
Come on, Eva.

4067
04:50:03,640 --> 04:50:04,420
Oh yeah, hold on.

4068
04:50:04,460 --> 04:50:05,320
Let me also change.

4069
04:50:07,460 --> 04:50:07,900
Camouflage.

4070
04:50:09,040 --> 04:50:09,480
Camouflage.

4071
04:50:09,880 --> 04:50:10,360
Oh, no.

4072
04:50:11,280 --> 04:50:12,300
Let's go with this one.

4073
04:50:14,060 --> 04:50:14,500
Camouflage.

4074
04:50:14,600 --> 04:50:15,240
We're in the woods.

4075
04:50:15,700 --> 04:50:16,140
Wait.

4076
04:50:16,520 --> 04:50:16,780
Wait.

4077
04:50:20,180 --> 04:50:20,620
Yes!

4078
04:50:23,040 --> 04:50:23,960
Oh my gosh.

4079
04:50:24,060 --> 04:50:24,520
Finally!

4080
04:50:25,040 --> 04:50:26,420
I get to use the moss!

4081
04:50:27,340 --> 04:50:28,380
Wait a second.

4082
04:50:28,960 --> 04:50:30,580
Why is spirit better than moss?

4083
04:50:38,500 --> 04:50:39,140
Fine.

4084
04:50:45,640 --> 04:50:46,700
What was what?

4085
04:50:48,460 --> 04:50:49,960
What was what, Eva?

4086
04:50:50,620 --> 04:50:51,740
What are you talking about?

4087
04:50:52,320 --> 04:50:53,040
The snake?

4088
04:50:53,400 --> 04:50:54,280
Oh my gosh.

4089
04:51:01,550 --> 04:51:03,650
That's what that was.

4090
04:51:08,600 --> 04:51:10,280
It's like Simon says with her.

4091
04:51:11,500 --> 04:51:12,960
Monkey see, monkey do.

4092
04:51:15,320 --> 04:51:16,460
Feed her the snake.

4093
04:51:17,420 --> 04:51:18,760
We're gonna feed you everything, Eva.

4094
04:51:18,840 --> 04:51:20,220
We want all your reactions, okay?

4095
04:51:20,700 --> 04:51:21,120
Come here.

4096
04:51:22,800 --> 04:51:23,580
Where are you?

4097
04:51:23,760 --> 04:51:24,460
Oh, come here!

4098
04:51:26,700 --> 04:51:27,420
Come here!

4099
04:51:31,640 --> 04:51:33,460
Why can't I carry you?

4100
04:51:35,920 --> 04:51:37,780
Just let me carry you, man.

4101
04:51:40,520 --> 04:51:42,960
Oh, so it was because she was too far away.

4102
04:51:43,060 --> 04:51:44,860
Would you like a reticulated python?

4103
04:51:50,240 --> 04:51:51,840
I want some more!

4104
04:51:53,340 --> 04:51:54,460
If I drank her...

4105
04:51:55,740 --> 04:51:57,100
Might be worth it.

4106
04:52:01,940 --> 04:52:03,680
Eva, get over here!

4107
04:52:03,680 --> 04:52:04,820
Eva!

4108
04:52:05,500 --> 04:52:06,660
Eva, please.

4109
04:52:07,340 --> 04:52:07,980
Okay, thank you.

4110
04:52:10,080 --> 04:52:11,560
Can I have seconds?

4111
04:52:15,540 --> 04:52:18,060
Wait, I can't tell by the map.

4112
04:52:18,900 --> 04:52:19,180
This way?

4113
04:52:19,260 --> 04:52:19,380
Yeah.

4114
04:52:23,690 --> 04:52:24,870
Come on!

4115
04:52:30,380 --> 04:52:31,820
Where are you?

4116
04:52:32,400 --> 04:52:33,780
What are you doing over there?

4117
04:52:33,900 --> 04:52:34,500
Come here!

4118
04:52:34,500 --> 04:52:34,680
No!

4119
04:52:42,080 --> 04:52:42,560
Okay.

4120
04:52:43,540 --> 04:52:43,980
Alrighty.

4121
04:52:45,420 --> 04:52:47,260
Sorry about missing the...

4122
04:52:47,260 --> 04:52:49,260
I really don't want to restart my PS2.

4123
04:52:49,420 --> 04:52:50,240
I'll be honest, guys.

4124
04:52:50,380 --> 04:52:52,480
Sorry about missing the noodles.

4125
04:52:52,640 --> 04:52:53,280
I thought...

4126
04:52:53,280 --> 04:52:56,320
I thought it would give me the option to...

4127
04:52:56,320 --> 04:52:58,020
Give it to her after I clicked it.

4128
04:52:58,100 --> 04:52:58,440
I forgot.

4129
04:52:58,940 --> 04:52:59,280
Sorry.

4130
04:53:02,280 --> 04:53:02,760
Alrighty.

4131
04:53:03,740 --> 04:53:06,140
We got a whole horde of guys here.

4132
04:53:11,960 --> 04:53:13,320
Wait, did they come from behind?

4133
04:53:19,760 --> 04:53:21,240
I hate this part.

4134
04:53:27,740 --> 04:53:28,620
Escort mission.

4135
04:53:32,820 --> 04:53:33,700
Escort mission.

4136
04:53:34,680 --> 04:53:36,660
Yeah, I honestly don't remember this song at all either.

4137
04:53:37,760 --> 04:53:41,840
Maybe because I just try not to think about this whole entire segment of the game.

4138
04:53:50,230 --> 04:53:51,330
Where are they coming from?

4139
04:53:51,450 --> 04:53:51,890
Behind?

4140
04:53:52,110 --> 04:53:52,670
Alright, come on, Eva.

4141
04:53:53,150 --> 04:53:54,110
Eva, come on.

4142
04:53:54,270 --> 04:53:55,030
Eva, let's go.

4143
04:53:58,710 --> 04:53:59,150
Eva!

4144
04:54:02,250 --> 04:54:03,050
Oh gosh.

4145
04:54:04,490 --> 04:54:05,730
Eva, get in the grass.

4146
04:54:07,090 --> 04:54:07,790
Come here, Eva.

4147
04:54:08,010 --> 04:54:08,730
Grass time.

4148
04:54:11,410 --> 04:54:12,490
It's grass time.

4149
04:54:13,310 --> 04:54:13,730
Okay, Eva.

4150
04:54:13,890 --> 04:54:15,710
Are they going to see her or...

4151
04:54:23,080 --> 04:54:23,960
Oh, okay.

4152
04:54:24,240 --> 04:54:25,220
I'll leave this to you.

4153
04:54:27,220 --> 04:54:28,820
I'm not murdering them.

4154
04:54:28,880 --> 04:54:29,420
She is.

4155
04:54:31,680 --> 04:54:32,540
Oh shoot.

4156
04:54:32,760 --> 04:54:33,480
Hold on.

4157
04:54:36,540 --> 04:54:39,760
Anyway, so I started a blacklisting.

4158
04:54:55,400 --> 04:54:56,620
They are not going to stop, Eva.

4159
04:54:56,680 --> 04:54:57,280
We just gotta go.

4160
04:54:58,920 --> 04:54:59,860
These guys suck.

4161
04:55:02,360 --> 04:55:03,640
Eva, Eva, come here.

4162
04:55:04,840 --> 04:55:05,520
What's wrong?

4163
04:55:05,520 --> 04:55:05,580
What's wrong?

4164
04:55:08,400 --> 04:55:09,300
Yeah, what's wrong?

4165
04:55:10,000 --> 04:55:11,780
Go check on your buddy first.

4166
04:55:12,500 --> 04:55:13,360
What's wrong?

4167
04:55:14,160 --> 04:55:14,740
Come on, Eva.

4168
04:55:15,500 --> 04:55:16,180
Right there?

4169
04:55:16,240 --> 04:55:16,580
Right where?

4170
04:55:17,700 --> 04:55:18,580
Under... Where?

4171
04:55:19,720 --> 04:55:20,440
Eva, come on.

4172
04:55:22,220 --> 04:55:22,960
Come on, Eva.

4173
04:55:23,280 --> 04:55:24,640
Let's just walk nice and slow.

4174
04:55:24,740 --> 04:55:25,600
They'll never notice us.

4175
04:55:26,600 --> 04:55:28,160
Oh, Eva, you need some food?

4176
04:55:29,540 --> 04:55:31,760
I don't wanna hear... She sounds like Mario.

4177
04:55:31,760 --> 04:55:32,720
I'm retired.

4178
04:55:33,900 --> 04:55:34,780
I'm retired.

4179
04:55:35,660 --> 04:55:38,260
It tasted bad, but I can give you... I got a lot of tree frogs.

4180
04:55:38,800 --> 04:55:40,020
These also taste bad.

4181
04:55:40,140 --> 04:55:40,580
Wait, hold on.

4182
04:55:40,660 --> 04:55:42,760
We gotta...

4183
04:55:42,760 --> 04:55:43,520
Come here.

4184
04:55:43,860 --> 04:55:44,380
Come here.

4185
04:55:44,820 --> 04:55:45,940
I'll give you something to eat.

4186
04:55:46,520 --> 04:55:48,700
I'll give you... I'll give you something to eat.

4187
04:55:49,120 --> 04:55:50,240
A Russian ration.

4188
04:55:55,800 --> 04:55:56,440
I know.

4189
04:55:57,000 --> 04:55:57,780
Alright, let's keep going.

4190
04:56:02,560 --> 04:56:03,320
We do?

4191
04:56:04,860 --> 04:56:05,620
No, we don't.

4192
04:56:05,680 --> 04:56:05,900
Come here.

4193
04:56:08,920 --> 04:56:10,040
Just keep going.

4194
04:56:10,180 --> 04:56:10,960
Keep walking, Eva.

4195
04:56:11,260 --> 04:56:11,540
Eva.

4196
04:56:12,020 --> 04:56:12,580
Eva.

4197
04:56:13,100 --> 04:56:14,760
I'm gonna need you to keep...

4198
04:56:15,520 --> 04:56:16,460
moving, okay?

4199
04:56:16,880 --> 04:56:18,820
Just a little bit at a time.

4200
04:56:19,020 --> 04:56:20,440
It's all good, okay?

4201
04:56:20,760 --> 04:56:22,200
Just keep going, Eva.

4202
04:56:22,740 --> 04:56:23,780
Yeah, come on.

4203
04:56:24,260 --> 04:56:25,480
I got my big guns.

4204
04:56:25,740 --> 04:56:26,860
You got your guns.

4205
04:56:27,480 --> 04:56:28,040
We're going.

4206
04:56:28,160 --> 04:56:29,140
We're guns blazing.

4207
04:56:29,520 --> 04:56:31,140
No, nobody's here.

4208
04:56:32,920 --> 04:56:34,360
Just your imagination.

4209
04:56:37,580 --> 04:56:38,560
Come on, Eva.

4210
04:56:41,240 --> 04:56:43,000
I just fed you!

4211
04:56:43,520 --> 04:56:43,780
Eva!

4212
04:56:54,100 --> 04:56:55,640
You're gonna take all my food.

4213
04:56:59,940 --> 04:57:01,860
I am so...

4214
04:57:01,860 --> 04:57:02,500
You know what, Eva?

4215
04:57:02,580 --> 04:57:03,460
You get all the tree frogs.

4216
04:57:03,540 --> 04:57:03,880
I'm sorry.

4217
04:57:07,240 --> 04:57:07,780
Yuck.

4218
04:57:08,760 --> 04:57:09,720
Oh gosh.

4219
04:57:09,860 --> 04:57:10,140
Uh-oh.

4220
04:57:10,440 --> 04:57:11,160
I think we're in trouble.

4221
04:57:13,600 --> 04:57:14,080
She...

4222
04:57:14,660 --> 04:57:16,160
is literally gonna take all my food.

4223
04:57:16,280 --> 04:57:17,320
What did you give me?

4224
04:57:18,180 --> 04:57:18,920
Oh my god.

4225
04:57:20,180 --> 04:57:20,820
Let's go.

4226
04:57:21,640 --> 04:57:21,960
Come on.

4227
04:57:24,520 --> 04:57:25,000
It's...

4228
04:57:25,000 --> 04:57:25,960
Yeah, nobody here.

4229
04:57:26,480 --> 04:57:26,940
Hold on.

4230
04:57:27,060 --> 04:57:28,600
It's up this... It's up here, right?

4231
04:57:30,040 --> 04:57:30,520
Yeah.

4232
04:57:30,900 --> 04:57:31,340
Come on, Eva.

4233
04:57:32,640 --> 04:57:33,120
Eva.

4234
04:57:33,560 --> 04:57:33,820
Eva.

4235
04:57:34,460 --> 04:57:35,700
It's literally right here.

4236
04:57:37,780 --> 04:57:38,840
Eva, we're so close.

4237
04:57:48,720 --> 04:57:50,060
I got her.

4238
04:57:50,160 --> 04:57:50,740
I got her.

4239
04:57:53,080 --> 04:57:54,220
Thanks, Major.

4240
04:57:56,700 --> 04:58:00,060
An unconscious Eva recovers stamina and faster to drag.

4241
04:58:00,140 --> 04:58:01,880
I thought I should've, but you know.

4242
04:58:03,060 --> 04:58:05,320
We did it the proper way.

4243
04:58:05,320 --> 04:58:08,600
Now I have no food for the boss.

4244
04:58:10,940 --> 04:58:14,300
Alright, we got through boss three out of four.

4245
04:58:14,460 --> 04:58:15,080
One more.

4246
04:58:16,520 --> 04:58:17,560
One more to go.

4247
04:58:21,260 --> 04:58:21,780
Oh boy.

4248
04:58:23,680 --> 04:58:24,180
Oh boy.

4249
04:58:28,310 --> 04:58:29,230
I'm getting hungry though.

4250
04:58:30,030 --> 04:58:31,010
Oh, nevermind.

4251
04:58:31,430 --> 04:58:32,010
Not quite.

4252
04:58:32,290 --> 04:58:33,250
Oh shoot, there's more?

4253
04:58:34,130 --> 04:58:34,470
Okay.

4254
04:58:37,910 --> 04:58:39,790
I need... Hold on.

4255
04:58:39,910 --> 04:58:41,570
I need to grab some food, actually.

4256
04:58:42,230 --> 04:58:42,930
So we're gonna...

4257
04:58:44,190 --> 04:58:44,750
Who's what?

4258
04:58:45,130 --> 04:58:47,110
They're gonna see me in the...

4259
04:58:47,110 --> 04:58:48,130
Wait, where's the food?

4260
04:58:50,930 --> 04:58:51,970
Are they still...

4261
04:58:51,970 --> 04:58:53,650
Are they still behind us?

4262
04:58:54,610 --> 04:58:55,530
Where are they?

4263
04:58:58,010 --> 04:58:58,950
Oh my god.

4264
04:59:13,250 --> 04:59:15,510
I thought we were done, guys.

4265
04:59:15,510 --> 04:59:16,330
I just thought that was it.

4266
04:59:25,680 --> 04:59:27,460
Eva, we need to be faster here, okay?

4267
04:59:28,380 --> 04:59:30,540
Eva, we need to...

4268
04:59:30,540 --> 04:59:31,600
We need to...

4269
04:59:31,600 --> 04:59:33,160
We need to get a move on, okay?

4270
04:59:33,840 --> 04:59:36,040
These guys are only gonna be asleep for a little bit.

4271
04:59:36,260 --> 04:59:37,580
And I'm gonna grab some food.

4272
04:59:38,860 --> 04:59:40,500
Is that good mushroom or bad mushroom?

4273
04:59:41,240 --> 04:59:42,580
I guess we'll find out.

4274
04:59:49,030 --> 04:59:49,830
Actually, Eva...

4275
04:59:50,250 --> 04:59:50,830
Good night.

4276
04:59:53,190 --> 04:59:53,630
Okay.

4277
04:59:54,370 --> 04:59:54,810
Alright.

4278
04:59:57,770 --> 04:59:58,210
Okay.

4279
05:00:04,610 --> 05:00:05,530
Good night, Eva.

4280
05:00:07,630 --> 05:00:09,910
Onwards we go...

4281
05:00:09,910 --> 05:00:11,670
To the finish...

4282
05:00:13,070 --> 05:00:13,890
Okay, girl.

4283
05:00:14,090 --> 05:00:16,790
I will get you all instant noodles you can have...

4284
05:00:17,910 --> 05:00:19,250
Once we're through...

4285
05:00:19,250 --> 05:00:20,610
Here, I'm gonna drag you through the mud a little bit.

4286
05:00:20,650 --> 05:00:21,130
Hold your breath.

4287
05:00:21,890 --> 05:00:22,390
Hold your breath.

4288
05:00:23,710 --> 05:00:24,230
Okay.

4289
05:00:24,690 --> 05:00:25,770
You're fine.

4290
05:00:26,450 --> 05:00:27,510
Another mud puddle!

4291
05:00:27,810 --> 05:00:29,610
Eva, hold your breath.

4292
05:00:30,530 --> 05:00:33,290
Girl, what are you...

4293
05:00:38,370 --> 05:00:40,070
Wait, which way am I supposed to go?

4294
05:00:45,460 --> 05:00:47,060
I guess it doesn't...

4295
05:00:48,400 --> 05:00:49,700
Either way, probably?

4296
05:00:50,140 --> 05:00:51,240
Oh my gosh, that's far.

4297
05:00:57,520 --> 05:00:58,860
Okay, let's just go this way.

4298
05:01:01,120 --> 05:01:03,260
Alright, watch your...

4299
05:01:03,260 --> 05:01:04,700
Watch your face.

4300
05:01:05,020 --> 05:01:06,140
Watch your face, Eva.

4301
05:01:09,260 --> 05:01:10,980
Shh, they're gonna hear you, Eva.

4302
05:01:12,320 --> 05:01:14,820
Eva, I need you to be quiet, okay?

4303
05:01:17,200 --> 05:01:18,420
Daddy is working.

4304
05:01:19,240 --> 05:01:20,260
Calorie, mate.

4305
05:01:21,260 --> 05:01:21,760
Okay.

4306
05:01:23,280 --> 05:01:24,560
Where are...

4307
05:01:24,560 --> 05:01:25,420
Any guys?

4308
05:01:29,720 --> 05:01:32,900
I'm wondering if I should check with my thermals real quick.

4309
05:01:36,780 --> 05:01:37,980
I went...

4310
05:01:37,980 --> 05:01:39,740
The wrong way!

4311
05:01:40,740 --> 05:01:44,940
But we can get a bit of an advantage from here, maybe.

4312
05:01:45,640 --> 05:01:46,320
Oh, maybe.

4313
05:01:54,950 --> 05:01:55,810
What's wrong?

4314
05:01:59,150 --> 05:01:59,650
Oh my god.

4315
05:02:00,650 --> 05:02:01,290
Please.

4316
05:02:03,530 --> 05:02:04,710
Calorie, mate.

4317
05:02:10,280 --> 05:02:11,820
This is the ideal date.

4318
05:02:14,220 --> 05:02:14,860
Stop!

4319
05:02:17,360 --> 05:02:21,380
Hold on, let me put my thermals back on so we can check.

4320
05:02:22,180 --> 05:02:23,460
Oh baby, a triple.

4321
05:02:24,800 --> 05:02:25,340
I know.

4322
05:02:32,940 --> 05:02:34,180
Is that another guy?

4323
05:02:36,640 --> 05:02:37,380
Okay, Eva.

4324
05:02:37,380 --> 05:02:40,040
Oh boss.

4325
05:02:41,860 --> 05:02:42,900
She's really...

4326
05:02:44,840 --> 05:02:46,820
She's really feeling herself, huh?

4327
05:02:47,540 --> 05:02:48,440
Love that for her.

4328
05:02:49,640 --> 05:02:50,000
Okay.

4329
05:02:50,860 --> 05:02:53,180
Can I drag her off this cliff?

4330
05:02:53,900 --> 05:02:54,760
Alright, Eva.

4331
05:02:55,800 --> 05:02:56,560
Let's try.

4332
05:03:09,260 --> 05:03:10,160
Oh my god, Snake.

4333
05:03:10,420 --> 05:03:11,100
Snake, I need you to run.

4334
05:03:11,700 --> 05:03:12,960
Yeah, you're seeing things.

4335
05:03:14,080 --> 05:03:14,600
Oh,

4336
05:03:18,240 --> 05:03:18,800
hi Kero-tan.

4337
05:03:19,780 --> 05:03:20,260
Oh

4338
05:03:24,310 --> 05:03:25,230
my gosh.

4339
05:03:27,810 --> 05:03:29,710
Where was that other guy though?

4340
05:03:31,170 --> 05:03:32,430
Oh, right there.

4341
05:03:32,890 --> 05:03:34,390
Okay, Eva.

4342
05:03:35,130 --> 05:03:37,170
It was cute for like two seconds, please.

4343
05:03:38,190 --> 05:03:39,090
Where is he?

4344
05:03:39,550 --> 05:03:40,490
Is that him right there?

4345
05:03:41,370 --> 05:03:42,310
Yeah, I see him, I see him.

4346
05:03:43,350 --> 05:03:44,330
That's him, that's him.

4347
05:03:44,990 --> 05:03:48,950
It's a miracle that he has not noticed any of his friends are down, honestly.

4348
05:03:49,310 --> 05:03:51,570
Oh boss, I feel so good.

4349
05:03:52,850 --> 05:03:54,130
What did the boss do?

4350
05:03:54,350 --> 05:03:55,490
Okay, Eva, let's go.

4351
05:03:55,770 --> 05:03:56,530
Turn around.

4352
05:03:57,070 --> 05:03:58,430
You can CQC her off the cliff.

4353
05:03:59,550 --> 05:04:02,790
Eva, let's go.

4354
05:04:02,910 --> 05:04:05,130
Oh, I gotta get you back down.

4355
05:04:05,270 --> 05:04:05,570
Okay, Eva.

4356
05:04:06,570 --> 05:04:06,910
Good night.

4357
05:04:07,150 --> 05:04:08,250
Okay, perfect.

4358
05:04:08,710 --> 05:04:09,270
Alright, let's go.

4359
05:04:20,510 --> 05:04:21,370
I think we're okay.

4360
05:04:22,390 --> 05:04:23,430
I think we're okay.

4361
05:04:25,390 --> 05:04:28,090
I saw something over there, but I think...

4362
05:04:29,290 --> 05:04:30,390
Yeah, I think we're okay.

4363
05:04:31,070 --> 05:04:32,590
Am I in the right... where?

4364
05:04:34,390 --> 05:04:35,490
Girl, shut up.

4365
05:04:47,580 --> 05:04:49,240
No way, you can interrogate Eva?

4366
05:04:51,920 --> 05:04:52,440
Alright.

4367
05:04:53,080 --> 05:04:54,060
Almost there.

4368
05:04:55,020 --> 05:04:56,020
Do I have to wake her up?

4369
05:04:58,840 --> 05:05:00,640
I want some instant noodles.

4370
05:05:08,820 --> 05:05:09,720
Wake up, Eva.

4371
05:05:11,660 --> 05:05:12,340
You ready?

4372
05:05:15,260 --> 05:05:17,660
Oh my gosh, I just noticed...

4373
05:05:18,960 --> 05:05:21,640
Oh my gosh, I just noticed.

4374
05:05:21,780 --> 05:05:22,640
I used to last.

4375
05:05:23,160 --> 05:05:23,520
Come on.

4376
05:05:24,480 --> 05:05:24,980
Come here.

4377
05:05:28,800 --> 05:05:30,900
Her hair is brown.

4378
05:05:31,300 --> 05:05:33,060
Don't worry about it.

4379
05:05:34,540 --> 05:05:36,060
Don't worry about it.

4380
05:05:36,440 --> 05:05:40,040
I mean, I'm worried about the wound, honestly, but like...

4381
05:05:40,040 --> 05:05:43,160
That's for future Eva to worry about, okay?

4382
05:05:44,900 --> 05:05:50,140
I wonder if she'll be all brown and poopy dirty in Delta in the cutscenes.

4383
05:05:53,850 --> 05:05:55,030
Okay, was that it?

4384
05:05:55,150 --> 05:05:55,670
Please say.

4385
05:05:56,330 --> 05:05:57,050
Please be yes.

4386
05:06:13,440 --> 05:06:15,000
Are we here?

4387
05:06:15,080 --> 05:06:15,760
At the lake?

4388
05:06:16,860 --> 05:06:18,240
Oh, now you can run.

4389
05:06:19,800 --> 05:06:20,400
What?

4390
05:06:22,100 --> 05:06:23,300
Now you can run?

4391
05:06:27,320 --> 05:06:29,180
Eva, you are such a drama queen.

4392
05:06:29,240 --> 05:06:31,320
She just wanted to be dragged by me.

4393
05:06:35,020 --> 05:06:36,040
The music.

4394
05:06:36,460 --> 05:06:37,020
Oh, the wig!

4395
05:06:38,400 --> 05:06:38,940
Wait.

4396
05:06:40,840 --> 05:06:41,820
Oh gosh.

4397
05:06:42,380 --> 05:06:43,300
Guys, I'm not ready.

4398
05:07:02,580 --> 05:07:04,340
Promise me.

4399
05:07:09,850 --> 05:07:11,810
Time for final boss.

4400
05:07:12,830 --> 05:07:14,530
Final boss time.

4401
05:07:30,480 --> 05:07:32,310
5 FPS.

4402
05:07:32,990 --> 05:07:34,850
It's doing its best.

4403
05:07:35,990 --> 05:07:37,010
Isn't it beautiful?

4404
05:07:38,670 --> 05:07:40,270
It's almost tragic.

4405
05:07:41,910 --> 05:07:45,390
When life ends, it gives off a final lingering aroma.

4406
05:07:47,770 --> 05:07:52,090
Light is but a farewell gift from the darkness to those on their way to die.

4407
05:07:53,570 --> 05:07:56,910
I've been waiting, Snake, for a long time.

4408
05:07:58,690 --> 05:08:03,890
Waiting for your birth, your growth, and the finality of today.

4409
05:08:06,310 --> 05:08:08,610
Boss, why are you doing this?

4410
05:08:09,010 --> 05:08:09,450
Why?

4411
05:08:11,750 --> 05:08:13,630
To make the world one again.

4412
05:08:15,510 --> 05:08:17,410
The world used to be whole.

4413
05:08:18,470 --> 05:08:25,070
But with the end of the Second World War, the philosophers began to fight amongst themselves, and the world was torn apart.

4414
05:08:26,390 --> 05:08:31,330
The Cobras, my comrades who trained and fought alongside me, were torn apart as well.

4415
05:08:32,830 --> 05:08:39,550
The foibles of politics and a march of time can turn friends into enemies just as easily as the wind changes.

4416
05:08:40,650 --> 05:08:41,790
Ridiculous, isn't it?

4417
05:08:44,570 --> 05:08:46,890
Yesterday's ally becomes today's opposition.

4418
05:08:47,250 --> 05:08:48,530
And this Cold War?

4419
05:08:50,490 --> 05:08:51,450
Think back.

4420
05:08:51,610 --> 05:08:54,850
When I was leading the Cobras, America and Russia were fighting together.

4421
05:08:54,850 --> 05:09:02,390
Now, consider whether America and Russia will still be enemies in the 21st century.

4422
05:09:04,790 --> 05:09:06,250
Somehow I doubt it.

4423
05:09:07,170 --> 05:09:13,910
Enemies change along with the times, the flow of the ages, and we soldiers are forced to play along.

4424
05:09:17,370 --> 05:09:22,870
I didn't raise you and shape you into the man you are today just so we could face each other in battle.

4425
05:09:22,870 --> 05:09:28,110
A soldier's skills aren't meant to be used to hurt friends.

4426
05:09:29,950 --> 05:09:31,870
So then what is an enemy?

4427
05:09:34,170 --> 05:09:36,790
Is there such a thing as an absolute timeless enemy?

4428
05:09:38,390 --> 05:09:41,250
There is no such thing, and never has been.

4429
05:09:42,270 --> 05:09:45,770
And the reason is that our enemies are human beings like us.

4430
05:09:46,890 --> 05:09:49,790
They can only be our enemies in relative terms.

4431
05:09:52,870 --> 05:09:55,030
The world must be made whole again.

4432
05:09:56,210 --> 05:09:58,750
The philosophers must be reunited.

4433
05:09:59,730 --> 05:10:02,110
I will devote my skills to that purpose.

4434
05:10:03,310 --> 05:10:06,350
And with the colonel's money, I will achieve that end.

4435
05:10:07,230 --> 05:10:09,570
Just as I once created the Cobras.

4436
05:10:10,710 --> 05:10:12,110
They are my family.

4437
05:10:13,670 --> 05:10:14,950
The Cobras...

4438
05:10:14,950 --> 05:10:19,970
I may no longer be able to bear children, but I still have a family.

4439
05:10:20,930 --> 05:10:21,570
Cobras...

4440
05:10:27,570 --> 05:10:30,530
It was November 1st, 1951.

4441
05:10:31,310 --> 05:10:35,390
I was in the Nevada desert, participating in atomic testing.

4442
05:10:38,970 --> 05:10:42,170
The name Nevada is derived from Spanish.

4443
05:10:42,790 --> 05:10:44,570
Covered in snow, white as snow.

4444
05:10:48,410 --> 05:10:52,230
And snow is exactly what I saw in that Nevada desert.

4445
05:10:53,530 --> 05:10:55,650
It froze my blood white.

4446
05:10:59,270 --> 05:11:02,690
Snake, you were an atomic test subject, weren't you?

4447
05:11:03,010 --> 05:11:04,330
On Bikini Atoll.

4448
05:11:06,250 --> 05:11:08,710
That's part of the reason I was drawn to you.

4449
05:11:09,150 --> 05:11:10,370
You and I are alike.

4450
05:11:12,370 --> 05:11:16,610
We're both slowly being eaten away by the karma of others.

4451
05:11:18,370 --> 05:11:21,670
We'll never have the chance to die peacefully of old age.

4452
05:11:22,870 --> 05:11:24,830
We have no tomorrow.

4453
05:11:24,830 --> 05:11:29,130
But we can still have hope for the future.

4454
05:11:30,930 --> 05:11:35,270
In 1960, I saw a vision of the ideal future.

4455
05:11:35,830 --> 05:11:36,570
From space.

4456
05:11:37,910 --> 05:11:46,830
Three years earlier, the Soviet Union had succeeded in launching Sputnik, the first man-made satellite in history, into orbit.

4457
05:11:47,790 --> 05:11:51,230
This came as a huge shock to the United States.

4458
05:11:51,230 --> 05:11:58,250
In response, America threw everything it had into its own manned spaceflight project, the Mercury Program.

4459
05:12:00,410 --> 05:12:08,550
Even as the Soviets seemed poised to send their first man into space, America was still experimenting with chimpanzees and rockets.

4460
05:12:09,530 --> 05:12:10,150
Monkey!

4461
05:12:11,070 --> 05:12:13,430
The government wanted human data.

4462
05:12:14,990 --> 05:12:19,070
So they secretly decided to send a human being into space.

4463
05:12:21,230 --> 05:12:23,090
I was the one they chose.

4464
05:12:24,910 --> 05:12:33,590
At the time, they didn't have the technology to block out cosmic rays, and whoever they sent up would inevitably be exposed to heavy radiation.

4465
05:12:34,170 --> 05:12:35,330
That's why they chose me.

4466
05:12:35,950 --> 05:12:38,230
After all, I'd already been irradiated once.

4467
05:12:38,690 --> 05:12:41,130
Of course, you won't find any of this in the history books.

4468
05:12:42,210 --> 05:12:45,410
I could see the planet as it appeared from space.

4469
05:12:47,810 --> 05:12:49,450
That's when it finally hit me.

4470
05:12:49,450 --> 05:12:54,950
Space exploration is nothing but another game in the power struggle between the U.S.

4471
05:12:54,990 --> 05:12:56,050
and the U.S.S.R.

4472
05:12:56,530 --> 05:13:02,350
Politics, economics, the arms race... they're all just arenas for meaningless competition.

4473
05:13:04,070 --> 05:13:05,870
I'm sure you can see that.

4474
05:13:06,210 --> 05:13:08,470
But the Earth itself has no boundaries.

4475
05:13:09,010 --> 05:13:11,790
No East, no West, no Cold War.

4476
05:13:11,790 --> 05:13:23,770
And the irony of it is, the United States and the Soviet Union are spending billions on their space programs and the missile race, only to arrive at the same conclusion.

4477
05:13:25,030 --> 05:13:33,770
In the 21st century, everyone will be able to see that we are all just inhabitants of a little celestial body called Earth.

4478
05:13:34,730 --> 05:13:35,070
Earth.

4479
05:13:36,330 --> 05:13:42,510
A world without communism or capitalism, that is the world I wanted to see.

4480
05:13:44,750 --> 05:13:47,610
But reality continued to betray me.

4481
05:13:51,690 --> 05:13:56,050
In 1961, I was sent to Cuba, to Bahia de Cochinos.

4482
05:13:58,730 --> 05:14:05,470
It was part of a CIA-sponsored invasion, under the guise of taking Cuban exiles back to their country.

4483
05:14:06,510 --> 05:14:08,210
But the U.S.

4484
05:14:08,390 --> 05:14:09,450
government betrayed them.

4485
05:14:10,050 --> 05:14:12,810
Our weak-kneed president held back their air support.

4486
05:14:13,510 --> 05:14:16,790
Defenseless, the exiles were annihilated by the Cuban army.

4487
05:14:17,530 --> 05:14:19,830
All I could do was watch in silence.

4488
05:14:22,490 --> 05:14:26,870
I was set up by the very country I'd sacrificed so much for.

4489
05:14:27,290 --> 05:14:30,530
By the very government I'd dedicated my life to defending.

4490
05:14:30,530 --> 05:14:31,530
History lesson, yeah.

4491
05:14:31,750 --> 05:14:32,810
Everybody pay attention.

4492
05:14:32,950 --> 05:14:36,230
I was driven from the surface world, and I went underground.

4493
05:14:38,690 --> 05:14:43,130
Then, two years ago, I faced the Sorrow, my old comrade in battle.

4494
05:14:45,130 --> 05:14:46,650
He was my friend.

4495
05:14:48,710 --> 05:14:50,650
But one of us had to die.

4496
05:14:52,370 --> 05:14:54,870
I was left with no choice.

4497
05:14:56,490 --> 05:14:58,470
The Sorrow gave his life for me.

4498
05:15:00,530 --> 05:15:02,830
There is no enmity between us.

4499
05:15:03,790 --> 05:15:06,110
One must live, and one must die.

4500
05:15:07,210 --> 05:15:08,790
That was the mission.

4501
05:15:09,830 --> 05:15:13,230
The ones who gave me that mission were the philosophers.

4502
05:15:16,910 --> 05:15:30,510
Early in the 20th century, the true holders of power in the United States, the Republic of China, and the newly formed Soviet Union...

4503
05:15:30,510 --> 05:15:34,790
The secret pact they formed there marked the beginning of the philosophers.

4504
05:15:36,030 --> 05:15:39,970
But the last of the original members died in the 1930s.

4505
05:15:41,110 --> 05:15:49,510
After that, the organization began to run out of control, and the Wiseman's Committee degenerated into a mere shell of its former self.

4506
05:15:49,530 --> 05:15:50,030
Is that a child?

4507
05:15:50,630 --> 05:15:51,090
Is that her?

4508
05:15:51,210 --> 05:15:53,630
The philosophers of today have no sense of good or evil.

4509
05:15:53,630 --> 05:15:54,810
It's like a kid on the right.

4510
05:15:54,810 --> 05:16:00,590
Their influence extends to countries and organizations involved in every aspect of every war.

4511
05:16:00,910 --> 05:16:02,570
They have become war itself.

4512
05:16:03,790 --> 05:16:05,410
That's how they operate.

4513
05:16:06,410 --> 05:16:09,590
The sacrifices of war cause a shift in the times.

4514
05:16:09,950 --> 05:16:14,190
This shift leads to renewed conflict, and in turn triggers the next war.

4515
05:16:14,590 --> 05:16:22,670
Like a nuclear chain reaction, each conflict sparks countless others, forming an endless spiral that will continue on for eternity.

4516
05:16:24,810 --> 05:16:26,950
Do you understand what I'm saying, Snake?

4517
05:16:27,310 --> 05:16:33,290
By consuming me and you, the philosophers intend to keep that cycle going forever.

4518
05:16:34,670 --> 05:16:38,350
It was my father who explained all this to me.

4519
05:16:40,910 --> 05:16:41,810
He was one of them.

4520
05:16:43,310 --> 05:16:48,110
You see, I am the last remaining child of the philosophers.

4521
05:16:51,330 --> 05:16:58,150
But after he revealed the truth, my father was killed by that same shapeless, formless organization.

4522
05:17:00,750 --> 05:17:04,910
And my father isn't the only thing the philosophers have taken from me.

4523
05:17:07,770 --> 05:17:13,630
In June of 1944, the Cobras and I took part in the landing at Normandy.

4524
05:17:14,670 --> 05:17:20,670
We'd been given a top secret mission to locate and destroy enemy V2 rocket installations.

4525
05:17:23,310 --> 05:17:25,350
I was pregnant at the time.

4526
05:17:27,390 --> 05:17:28,950
The sorrow was the father.

4527
05:17:30,290 --> 05:17:32,990
I gave birth on the field of battle.

4528
05:17:34,390 --> 05:17:36,070
A beautiful baby boy.

4529
05:17:37,630 --> 05:17:41,850
But my child was snatched away from me by the philosophers.

4530
05:17:53,260 --> 05:17:55,100
Look at this scar.

4531
05:17:55,660 --> 05:17:58,100
This is proof that I was once a mother.

4532
05:17:59,360 --> 05:18:00,460
He was huge.

4533
05:18:00,460 --> 05:18:02,780
I gave up my body and my child for my country.

4534
05:18:04,360 --> 05:18:06,780
There is nothing left inside me now.

4535
05:18:08,100 --> 05:18:09,100
Nothing at all.

4536
05:18:10,400 --> 05:18:12,620
No hatred, not even regret.

4537
05:18:13,860 --> 05:18:18,500
And yet sometimes at night, I can still feel the pain creeping up inside me.

4538
05:18:19,700 --> 05:18:20,480
Slithering through my veins.

4539
05:18:20,500 --> 05:18:21,080
Through my body.

4540
05:18:21,780 --> 05:18:22,460
Like a snake.

4541
05:18:29,200 --> 05:18:31,660
I've never talked this much about myself before.

4542
05:18:33,320 --> 05:18:33,680
Thanks.

4543
05:18:34,660 --> 05:18:36,300
Thanks for listening to me.

4544
05:18:40,780 --> 05:18:42,160
I feel content.

4545
05:18:43,680 --> 05:18:44,020
Snake.

4546
05:18:47,560 --> 05:18:48,980
Commence the operation.

4547
05:18:50,500 --> 05:18:50,580
Go.

4548
05:18:52,300 --> 05:18:53,400
I raised you.

4549
05:18:54,540 --> 05:18:55,780
I loved you.

4550
05:18:56,180 --> 05:18:57,200
I've given you weapons.

4551
05:18:57,580 --> 05:18:58,480
Taught you techniques.

4552
05:18:58,900 --> 05:19:00,060
Endowed you with knowledge.

4553
05:19:01,220 --> 05:19:01,820
I love weapons.

4554
05:19:01,820 --> 05:19:03,720
There is nothing more for me to give you.

4555
05:19:03,740 --> 05:19:05,080
Every birthday I get a new weapon.

4556
05:19:05,580 --> 05:19:09,140
All that's left for you to take is my life.

4557
05:19:09,220 --> 05:19:09,520
No!

4558
05:19:09,960 --> 05:19:11,000
By your own hand.

4559
05:19:11,100 --> 05:19:11,440
No!

4560
05:19:12,140 --> 05:19:14,580
One must die and one must live.

4561
05:19:15,240 --> 05:19:16,860
No victory, no defeat.

4562
05:19:17,440 --> 05:19:19,640
The survivor will carry on the fight.

4563
05:19:20,500 --> 05:19:21,440
It is our destiny.

4564
05:19:23,220 --> 05:19:26,500
The one who survives will inherit the title of boss.

4565
05:19:27,720 --> 05:19:33,760
And the one who inherits the title of boss will face an existence of endless battle.

4566
05:19:36,780 --> 05:19:38,500
I'll give you ten minutes.

4567
05:19:38,520 --> 05:19:39,420
Ten minutes.

4568
05:19:40,720 --> 05:19:44,200
In ten minutes, Migs will come and bomb the hell out of this place.

4569
05:19:45,040 --> 05:19:48,980
If you can beat me in less than ten minutes, you'll be able to escape in time.

4570
05:19:48,980 --> 05:19:51,200
Oh god, she's going to say one of my favorite lines.

4571
05:19:51,680 --> 05:19:54,600
Let's make this the greatest ten minutes of our lives, Jack.

4572
05:19:56,100 --> 05:19:56,700
Boss!

4573
05:19:57,200 --> 05:19:58,280
You're a soldier.

4574
05:19:59,120 --> 05:20:00,160
Finish your mission.

4575
05:20:01,480 --> 05:20:02,840
Prove your loyalty.

4576
05:20:04,000 --> 05:20:04,600
Loyalty.

4577
05:20:05,520 --> 05:20:06,880
Loyalty to the mission.

4578
05:20:07,000 --> 05:20:07,580
Face me.

4579
05:20:09,800 --> 05:20:10,400
Okay.

4580
05:20:15,630 --> 05:20:16,630
Get ready!

4581
05:20:22,640 --> 05:20:23,160
Wait, boss!

4582
05:20:26,420 --> 05:20:26,700
Boss!

4583
05:20:28,240 --> 05:20:29,640
Where am I?

4584
05:20:32,000 --> 05:20:32,860
Hold on.

4585
05:20:37,050 --> 05:20:37,940
Can I take you down?

4586
05:20:39,320 --> 05:20:41,160
Oh, she takes me down.

4587
05:20:44,180 --> 05:20:45,020
Hold on.

4588
05:20:47,100 --> 05:20:48,960
Put on sneaking suit!

4589
05:20:49,300 --> 05:20:50,700
Put on sneaking suit!

4590
05:20:52,020 --> 05:20:54,120
You guys, I wasn't even going to start.

4591
05:20:54,660 --> 05:20:55,740
I was going to go to the bathroom.

4592
05:20:55,740 --> 05:20:55,920
Bathroom.

4593
05:20:58,440 --> 05:20:59,900
Oh, I don't have my CQC gun.

4594
05:21:00,100 --> 05:21:00,660
What am I using?

4595
05:21:03,810 --> 05:21:04,890
Oh, there we go.

4596
05:21:07,650 --> 05:21:09,590
I feel like this one...

4597
05:21:10,890 --> 05:21:12,070
We'll do the tranq.

4598
05:21:12,190 --> 05:21:12,970
We'll do a tranq one.

4599
05:21:16,130 --> 05:21:17,630
I have to go to the bathroom so bad.

4600
05:21:17,710 --> 05:21:18,170
Oh my gosh.

4601
05:21:18,270 --> 05:21:22,210
I've been having to go for like the past twenty minutes, but I can't let her not talk.

4602
05:21:22,830 --> 05:21:25,730
This one, I'll just let you guys know how it's going to take me.

4603
05:21:25,730 --> 05:21:31,070
Either a couple tries or definitely this first one is not going to be...

4604
05:21:32,870 --> 05:21:34,410
Is not going to be...

4605
05:21:34,410 --> 05:21:36,750
It's not going to be like a one and done because...

4606
05:21:36,750 --> 05:21:37,590
I like to hear...

4607
05:21:37,590 --> 05:21:38,610
I like to...

4608
05:21:38,610 --> 05:21:40,630
Rather, I want to like try and time it.

4609
05:21:41,350 --> 05:21:41,810
You know?

4610
05:21:41,970 --> 05:21:43,910
With the Snake Eater song, so...

4611
05:21:44,870 --> 05:21:45,450
Yeah, yeah.

4612
05:21:46,150 --> 05:21:46,930
What do I need?

4613
05:21:47,010 --> 05:21:47,570
Oh, bandage.

4614
05:21:50,430 --> 05:21:51,310
Broken bones.

4615
05:21:55,170 --> 05:21:55,570
Oh.

4616
05:21:55,710 --> 05:21:56,470
Oh, let me go pee.

4617
05:21:57,350 --> 05:21:58,010
One second.

4618
05:21:58,430 --> 05:21:59,050
One second.

4619
05:21:59,110 --> 05:22:00,610
Let me go to the bathroom real quick, guys.

4620
05:22:03,370 --> 05:22:04,170
And then...

4621
05:22:04,170 --> 05:22:05,350
We will do.

4622
05:22:07,390 --> 05:22:09,030
Also, I'm going to get some migraine medicine.

4623
05:22:10,290 --> 05:22:11,370
Because I feel that...

4624
05:22:13,390 --> 05:22:13,790
Like...

4625
05:22:14,290 --> 05:22:15,290
I'm on the tip.

4626
05:22:16,270 --> 05:22:19,650
It's like I have a headache right now, but I feel like it's going to turn into a migraine.

4627
05:22:20,690 --> 05:22:21,090
Like...

4628
05:22:21,910 --> 05:22:22,310
Any...

4629
05:22:22,310 --> 05:22:23,270
In like a couple of minutes.

4630
05:22:24,150 --> 05:22:24,550
So...

4631
05:22:25,310 --> 05:22:27,010
Give me a few minutes.

4632
05:22:27,350 --> 05:22:29,410
Here, I'll let you guys look at here.

4633
05:22:29,530 --> 05:22:31,090
Actually, before I forget...

4634
05:22:31,090 --> 05:22:32,650
Let me change my camouflage...

4635
05:22:36,290 --> 05:22:36,690
To...

4636
05:22:39,250 --> 05:22:39,650
Snow...

4637
05:22:41,970 --> 05:22:42,370
Face.

4638
05:22:44,330 --> 05:22:44,930
I don't...

4639
05:22:44,930 --> 05:22:46,290
I'm just going to do no paint.

4640
05:22:46,410 --> 05:22:47,730
Because I feel like...

4641
05:22:47,730 --> 05:22:49,630
I don't want to forget about it.

4642
05:22:49,630 --> 05:22:51,030
And if I do the cutscene, you know.

4643
05:22:51,570 --> 05:22:53,750
Okay, so give me a few minutes, guys.

4644
05:22:54,090 --> 05:22:55,630
And then we shall commence...

4645
05:22:56,730 --> 05:22:57,530
Final battle.

4646
05:22:58,810 --> 05:22:59,150
Okay.

4647
05:23:00,110 --> 05:23:00,510
BRB.

4648
05:23:03,170 --> 05:23:04,530
I'm also probably going to get some food.

4649
05:23:04,590 --> 05:23:07,250
So this is probably a good time if you have to get food...

4650
05:23:07,250 --> 05:23:08,470
Or do anything...

4651
05:23:08,470 --> 05:23:10,130
And you don't want to miss the fight...

4652
05:23:10,130 --> 05:23:10,970
To go do that.

4653
05:23:11,270 --> 05:23:11,790
So, yeah.

4654
05:23:11,930 --> 05:23:12,710
I'll be right back.

4655
05:30:17,210 --> 05:30:18,010
I'm back.

4656
05:30:18,470 --> 05:30:20,010
Sorry about the long, long wait.

4657
05:30:22,290 --> 05:30:23,530
Sorry about that.

4658
05:30:26,250 --> 05:30:26,750
Okay.

4659
05:30:29,850 --> 05:30:31,050
I got some food.

4660
05:30:31,150 --> 05:30:32,350
I just had to heat it up.

4661
05:30:34,310 --> 05:30:35,090
Welcome back.

4662
05:30:35,190 --> 05:30:35,770
Thank you.

4663
05:30:36,110 --> 05:30:36,890
Thank you, thank you.

4664
05:30:37,010 --> 05:30:39,570
I wanted to get something to eat before I...

4665
05:30:44,010 --> 05:30:45,010
Before I...

4666
05:30:45,540 --> 05:30:46,310
Went into this.

4667
05:30:48,390 --> 05:30:49,270
Welcome back.

4668
05:30:49,410 --> 05:30:49,670
I'm back.

4669
05:30:52,170 --> 05:30:52,750
Okay.

4670
05:30:54,330 --> 05:30:56,410
And I needed more drink.

4671
05:31:00,650 --> 05:31:01,230
Yummy.

4672
05:31:02,470 --> 05:31:03,510
Gamer Supps.

4673
05:31:04,470 --> 05:31:05,650
I'm actually trying...

4674
05:31:05,650 --> 05:31:07,810
They send me so much Gamer Supps...

4675
05:31:07,810 --> 05:31:09,230
That I'm actually trying to get through it all.

4676
05:31:09,330 --> 05:31:10,070
So I'm like...

4677
05:31:10,070 --> 05:31:11,030
Okay, don't buy any...

4678
05:31:11,030 --> 05:31:12,690
No, don't buy any new tea.

4679
05:31:13,110 --> 05:31:14,240
Don't buy any new...

4680
05:31:16,290 --> 05:31:17,310
New anything.

4681
05:31:18,610 --> 05:31:24,980
I don't know if this is a glitch...

4682
05:31:24,980 --> 05:31:26,980
Or if there is multiple 50.

4683
05:31:27,440 --> 05:31:29,300
Thank you so much.

4684
05:31:29,380 --> 05:31:29,800
Oh my gosh.

4685
05:31:29,840 --> 05:31:30,480
Thank you.

4686
05:31:30,620 --> 05:31:32,100
I really, really appreciate it.

4687
05:31:32,580 --> 05:31:33,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

4688
05:31:36,740 --> 05:31:38,840
My own personal survival.

4689
05:31:40,280 --> 05:31:43,900
Yeah, let me just fuel up a little bit.

4690
05:31:54,710 --> 05:31:58,290
I got some leftover taco stuff, so...

4691
05:31:59,270 --> 05:31:59,570
Yeah.

4692
05:31:59,570 --> 05:32:01,170
It's hot though.

4693
05:32:01,570 --> 05:32:02,090
It's hot.

4694
05:32:05,610 --> 05:32:06,710
Not a glitch.

4695
05:32:06,770 --> 05:32:07,750
They just gave me 200 members.

4696
05:32:08,070 --> 05:32:09,270
Thank you!

4697
05:32:10,210 --> 05:32:11,890
Thank you so much!

4698
05:32:12,770 --> 05:32:13,910
Holy moly.

4699
05:32:16,470 --> 05:32:17,950
Thank you so much.

4700
05:32:19,110 --> 05:32:21,590
I hate eating on my lap though.

4701
05:32:24,410 --> 05:32:24,780
Because...

4702
05:32:27,750 --> 05:32:28,490
Because...

4703
05:32:28,490 --> 05:32:29,510
The light...

4704
05:32:29,510 --> 05:32:30,530
Okay, so I have like a...

4705
05:32:30,530 --> 05:32:31,490
I have like a desk...

4706
05:32:32,370 --> 05:32:35,590
Like a RGB light under my desk.

4707
05:32:35,830 --> 05:32:39,030
But it like always illuminates my food in like a...

4708
05:32:39,030 --> 05:32:39,550
It doesn't...

4709
05:32:39,550 --> 05:32:41,530
It makes the food look so gross, you know?

4710
05:32:57,750 --> 05:32:59,610
Yeah, it's my RGB food.

4711
05:32:59,830 --> 05:33:01,050
It's like radioactive real.

4712
05:33:01,990 --> 05:33:03,750
But it makes it look so gross.

4713
05:33:03,930 --> 05:33:05,430
Especially when it turns purple.

4714
05:33:06,090 --> 05:33:07,770
Or like a purple-y pink.

4715
05:33:10,230 --> 05:33:11,430
It like just...

4716
05:33:11,430 --> 05:33:12,630
And it makes it look...

4717
05:33:12,630 --> 05:33:14,950
It makes everything look radioactive because of the colors.

4718
05:33:26,700 --> 05:33:29,060
Okay, I got a bite in, but I'm gonna be honest...

4719
05:33:32,280 --> 05:33:34,840
I'm just really wanting to do this fight, so...

4720
05:33:34,840 --> 05:33:37,140
And also it's really hot, so...

4721
05:33:37,140 --> 05:33:38,740
I'm gonna hold off for now.

4722
05:33:39,200 --> 05:33:40,400
Let's see...

4723
05:33:41,580 --> 05:33:43,480
Let's see how it goes here.

4724
05:33:46,160 --> 05:33:47,320
How was the fishing trip?

4725
05:33:47,400 --> 05:33:47,660
Good.

4726
05:33:47,980 --> 05:33:48,440
Very good.

4727
05:33:49,460 --> 05:33:51,020
Food looks good in yellow light.

4728
05:33:52,060 --> 05:33:52,540
Does it?

4729
05:33:52,920 --> 05:33:56,140
A lot of my lights are like the yellow-y lights.

4730
05:33:57,160 --> 05:33:59,020
I know some people hate it.

4731
05:33:59,460 --> 05:33:59,980
But...

4732
05:33:59,980 --> 05:34:02,060
And it's weird because I prefer like...

4733
05:34:03,900 --> 05:34:05,140
Bright, natural.

4734
05:34:06,320 --> 05:34:09,040
Like I prefer opening up all my windows and stuff.

4735
05:34:11,020 --> 05:34:11,540
But...

4736
05:34:13,840 --> 05:34:14,360
But...

4737
05:34:16,060 --> 05:34:19,900
I feel like some of the super bright lights are just too bright.

4738
05:34:19,980 --> 05:34:21,620
It's not what I want at night especially.

4739
05:34:25,910 --> 05:34:27,530
Like at night I want...

4740
05:34:27,530 --> 05:34:31,670
I want it to be warm and, you know, make me feel tired.

4741
05:34:31,830 --> 05:34:33,770
And then in the day I just open up all my windows.

4742
05:34:34,170 --> 05:34:36,630
So I don't really ever need the super bright light.

4743
05:34:36,690 --> 05:34:37,250
You know what I mean?

4744
05:34:39,690 --> 05:34:41,610
The closer to natural sunlight the better.

4745
05:34:41,770 --> 05:34:42,810
Yeah, exactly.

4746
05:34:44,050 --> 05:34:44,410
Exactly.

4747
05:34:44,690 --> 05:34:45,230
Anyway, okay.

4748
05:34:45,230 --> 05:34:47,230
I'm probably gonna die here, but...

4749
05:34:54,000 --> 05:34:55,680
Oh my god, I just realized...

4750
05:34:56,140 --> 05:34:57,220
Oh my god!

4751
05:34:57,640 --> 05:34:58,040
Please!

4752
05:34:58,520 --> 05:34:58,760
Wait!

4753
05:34:59,100 --> 05:35:00,200
Can I not change the camera?

4754
05:35:01,440 --> 05:35:02,480
Wait, can I not...

4755
05:35:02,480 --> 05:35:03,720
Can I not change the camera?

4756
05:35:10,060 --> 05:35:10,860
Oh, shoot.

4757
05:35:12,900 --> 05:35:13,980
Not for this fight.

4758
05:35:14,100 --> 05:35:15,300
Oh my gosh, no way, really?

4759
05:35:16,600 --> 05:35:17,480
Oh, boss camera is fixed.

4760
05:35:17,620 --> 05:35:18,900
Oh, I don't remember that at all.

4761
05:35:19,040 --> 05:35:19,220
Okay.

4762
05:35:22,400 --> 05:35:23,660
How do I...

4763
05:35:23,660 --> 05:35:28,200
I just combatted her CQC, but I also don't remember how to CQC her.

4764
05:35:30,400 --> 05:35:30,880
Bandage.

4765
05:35:32,460 --> 05:35:33,420
And then...

4766
05:35:33,420 --> 05:35:34,300
Disinfectant.

4767
05:35:39,220 --> 05:35:39,780
What do I need?

4768
05:35:40,580 --> 05:35:41,560
Oh, suture.

4769
05:35:46,440 --> 05:35:47,320
Holding circle.

4770
05:35:47,620 --> 05:35:47,860
Okay.

4771
05:35:51,440 --> 05:35:52,100
Oh my god.

4772
05:35:52,680 --> 05:35:53,640
Where is she?

4773
05:35:53,800 --> 05:35:54,550
She's scaring me.

4774
05:36:01,810 --> 05:36:02,510
Boss?

4775
05:36:04,270 --> 05:36:04,830
Boss?

4776
05:36:06,550 --> 05:36:07,250
I hear her.

4777
05:36:08,350 --> 05:36:08,710
Boss?

4778
05:36:09,530 --> 05:36:09,970
Boss?

4779
05:36:11,330 --> 05:36:12,030
Boss?

4780
05:36:12,870 --> 05:36:13,450
Boss?

4781
05:36:14,490 --> 05:36:14,830
Boss?

4782
05:36:16,770 --> 05:36:18,070
She doesn't see me, does she?

4783
05:36:24,550 --> 05:36:26,390
Ah, I blew my aim.

4784
05:36:34,240 --> 05:36:34,560
Ah!

4785
05:36:37,820 --> 05:36:39,720
Holding circle did not work.

4786
05:36:40,460 --> 05:36:41,500
It's okay though?

4787
05:36:42,540 --> 05:36:42,980
I know!

4788
05:36:43,360 --> 05:36:43,760
Oh my god.

4789
05:36:44,920 --> 05:36:45,480
I'm trying!

4790
05:36:48,740 --> 05:36:50,140
Turning it down a little bit.

4791
05:37:16,820 --> 05:37:17,860
Where'd she go?

4792
05:37:20,320 --> 05:37:21,300
Where'd she go?

4793
05:37:22,400 --> 05:37:23,540
Where'd she go?

4794
05:37:24,740 --> 05:37:25,640
Where'd she go?

4795
05:37:26,080 --> 05:37:27,000
She's running.

4796
05:37:34,870 --> 05:37:35,270
Shoot.

4797
05:37:37,730 --> 05:37:38,190
Oh my god.

4798
05:37:38,550 --> 05:37:39,130
Oh gosh!

4799
05:37:44,930 --> 05:37:46,650
Oh no, dang it!

4800
05:37:46,970 --> 05:37:48,190
Oh come on!

4801
05:37:48,710 --> 05:37:49,470
Snake it up!

4802
05:37:54,590 --> 05:37:55,790
Oh my gosh.

4803
05:37:58,650 --> 05:37:59,890
Dodging that is...

4804
05:38:05,050 --> 05:38:06,250
Bone fractured.

4805
05:38:08,710 --> 05:38:09,550
What else?

4806
05:38:10,610 --> 05:38:11,210
Bandage.

4807
05:38:13,710 --> 05:38:15,590
Tap the moment you hear her grab you.

4808
05:38:15,750 --> 05:38:15,930
Okay.

4809
05:38:32,750 --> 05:38:33,710
Where is she?

4810
05:38:34,770 --> 05:38:35,810
Oh, there she is.

4811
05:38:39,170 --> 05:38:39,710
Take it.

4812
05:38:44,280 --> 05:38:45,260
Where'd she go?

4813
05:38:45,260 --> 05:38:46,020
Where'd she stop?

4814
05:38:49,280 --> 05:38:51,160
Don't go by there.

4815
05:38:55,150 --> 05:38:55,810
Shoot.

4816
05:38:56,750 --> 05:38:57,870
I missed her.

4817
05:39:00,310 --> 05:39:01,770
Flowers are in the way.

4818
05:39:02,550 --> 05:39:03,510
Flowers are in the way.

4819
05:39:30,620 --> 05:39:32,300
Get her, Snake.

4820
05:39:34,860 --> 05:39:35,860
Oh my gosh.

4821
05:39:42,070 --> 05:39:43,070
I'm gonna...

4822
05:39:43,070 --> 05:39:44,030
Actually use...

4823
05:39:46,390 --> 05:39:47,390
My mozen.

4824
05:39:49,790 --> 05:39:51,630
I don't know why I wasn't using it before.

4825
05:39:53,190 --> 05:39:54,410
Yeah, you have to...

4826
05:39:54,410 --> 05:39:55,750
Yeah, exactly.

4827
05:39:56,710 --> 05:39:57,610
Where'd she go though?

4828
05:40:00,710 --> 05:40:01,470
Was that her?

4829
05:40:01,910 --> 05:40:02,430
Oh my gosh.

4830
05:40:04,830 --> 05:40:05,990
I can't believe I saw her.

4831
05:40:08,570 --> 05:40:09,330
Where'd she go?

4832
05:40:10,670 --> 05:40:11,510
Where'd she go?

4833
05:40:14,170 --> 05:40:15,050
Where'd she go?

4834
05:40:17,590 --> 05:40:21,790
I'm expecting like her to just say five minutes left like any second now, you know?

4835
05:40:24,710 --> 05:40:25,930
Oh, there it is.

4836
05:40:29,190 --> 05:40:30,150
Oh gosh.

4837
05:40:32,030 --> 05:40:33,110
Where is she going?

4838
05:40:33,550 --> 05:40:34,510
Oh, I can't see anything.

4839
05:40:34,810 --> 05:40:35,270
Flowers.

4840
05:40:35,530 --> 05:40:36,210
Where are you hiding?

4841
05:40:39,730 --> 05:40:40,950
I found you.

4842
05:40:45,250 --> 05:40:45,730
I'm ready.

4843
05:40:54,810 --> 05:40:56,510
I'm gonna cry.

4844
05:40:56,830 --> 05:40:57,790
I'm gonna cry.

4845
05:41:08,360 --> 05:41:09,840
Oh, look at the snake up there.

4846
05:41:11,520 --> 05:41:12,460
Where'd she go?

4847
05:41:12,920 --> 05:41:13,440
Oh, I see her.

4848
05:41:20,670 --> 05:41:21,570
There she goes.

4849
05:41:28,550 --> 05:41:29,830
Where did she go?

4850
05:41:30,550 --> 05:41:31,710
Oh, I lost her.

4851
05:41:44,280 --> 05:41:44,840
Oh,

4852
05:42:05,720 --> 05:42:06,340
did I get hurt?

4853
05:42:06,780 --> 05:42:08,040
I can't tell actually.

4854
05:42:09,160 --> 05:42:09,780
Did I?

4855
05:42:09,860 --> 05:42:10,300
Oh my gosh.

4856
05:42:10,500 --> 05:42:11,120
Snake, please.

4857
05:42:12,340 --> 05:42:12,820
Snake.

4858
05:42:12,980 --> 05:42:13,540
Oh god.

4859
05:42:13,880 --> 05:42:16,140
This function just kills me every time.

4860
05:42:16,940 --> 05:42:17,460
I missed?

4861
05:42:18,460 --> 05:42:20,900
How is it twice in a row I missed?

4862
05:42:26,720 --> 05:42:27,360
It's okay.

4863
05:42:27,480 --> 05:42:29,500
Like I said, I...

4864
05:42:30,360 --> 05:42:31,080
Oh, whoops.

4865
05:42:31,480 --> 05:42:33,080
I am not like...

4866
05:42:34,460 --> 05:42:37,760
Being like, I have to defeat her this time, you know?

4867
05:42:38,760 --> 05:42:40,160
So no worries.

4868
05:42:50,220 --> 05:42:54,040
Oh, we're about...

4869
05:42:54,040 --> 05:42:55,460
I got her.

4870
05:42:56,920 --> 05:42:57,600
Crap, snake!

4871
05:43:06,100 --> 05:43:07,140
Here it is.

4872
05:43:11,240 --> 05:43:12,220
Where did it go?

4873
05:43:13,140 --> 05:43:17,220
With darkness and silence through the night...

4874
05:43:20,020 --> 05:43:21,220
What a thrill...

4875
05:43:22,040 --> 05:43:22,720
Where'd she go?

4876
05:43:22,820 --> 05:43:23,420
Oh, there she is.

4877
05:43:23,960 --> 05:43:25,220
I'm searching...

4878
05:43:25,760 --> 05:43:27,260
To melt into you...

4879
05:43:27,880 --> 05:43:28,280
Oh my god!

4880
05:43:28,400 --> 05:43:28,900
Oh my god!

4881
05:43:30,320 --> 05:43:33,220
What a fear in my heart...

4882
05:43:34,680 --> 05:43:37,500
But you're so supreme!

4883
05:43:37,500 --> 05:43:37,680
Supreme!

4884
05:43:40,520 --> 05:43:42,660
I like being alive!

4885
05:43:43,760 --> 05:43:46,260
Not for honor, but

4886
05:43:50,700 --> 05:43:51,020
for...

4887
05:43:51,600 --> 05:43:55,320
In my time...

4888
05:43:55,320 --> 05:44:02,560
There'll be no one else...

4889
05:44:04,240 --> 05:44:05,340
I thought I heard her.

4890
05:44:05,560 --> 05:44:07,180
Oh, I do hear her.

4891
05:44:07,440 --> 05:44:09,100
Oh gosh, I can't see anything.

4892
05:44:12,120 --> 05:44:13,640
There you are.

4893
05:44:15,560 --> 05:44:17,560
In a dream...

4894
05:44:18,420 --> 05:44:20,560
Snake eater...

4895
05:44:27,360 --> 05:44:29,000
I'm trying to move!

4896
05:44:29,360 --> 05:44:34,740
Someday we'll feed on a tree frog...

4897
05:44:34,740 --> 05:44:40,000
Ordeal and trial to survive...

4898
05:44:40,000 --> 05:44:45,100
For the day we sing a lullaby...

4899
05:44:45,100 --> 05:44:45,640
Where'd she go?

4900
05:44:46,060 --> 05:44:49,000
I'd give my life...

4901
05:44:49,000 --> 05:44:50,660
Not for honor...

4902
05:44:50,660 --> 05:44:51,560
One more minute!

4903
05:44:51,840 --> 05:44:52,600
Ok, don't tell me that.

4904
05:44:52,840 --> 05:44:53,580
It's stressing me out.

4905
05:44:56,850 --> 05:45:00,000
In my time...

4906
05:45:02,770 --> 05:45:08,310
No one else...

4907
05:45:08,310 --> 05:45:12,210
Crime is the way...

4908
05:45:12,210 --> 05:45:15,610
I fly to you!

4909
05:45:18,130 --> 05:45:22,710
I'm still in a dream...

4910
05:45:22,710 --> 05:45:24,590
I'm about to die, actually.

4911
05:45:29,430 --> 05:45:31,270
Snake eater...

4912
05:45:31,270 --> 05:45:33,910
Did she dodge my attack earlier, I think.

4913
05:45:36,250 --> 05:45:41,910
I'm still in a dream...

4914
05:45:42,470 --> 05:45:44,910
Snake eater...

4915
05:45:50,630 --> 05:45:54,290
There it is.

4916
05:46:10,320 --> 05:46:11,080
Goodbye!

4917
05:46:23,040 --> 05:46:23,720
Goodbye!

4918
05:46:30,930 --> 05:46:31,430
Honestly...

4919
05:46:32,930 --> 05:46:34,430
Maybe this is the better end.

4920
05:46:36,010 --> 05:46:36,510
Actually...

4921
05:46:38,570 --> 05:46:39,070
Oh,

4922
05:46:49,860 --> 05:46:50,600
it's changing.

4923
05:46:51,700 --> 05:46:54,780
Actually, I haven't let it change once this whole time, so...

4924
05:46:54,780 --> 05:46:55,320
Let's do it.

4925
05:46:57,580 --> 05:46:59,380
I'll snack while...

4926
05:47:19,540 --> 05:47:20,900
I'm paranoid.

4927
05:47:25,360 --> 05:47:26,720
I'm paranoid.

4928
05:47:33,220 --> 05:47:34,300
I'm paranoid.

4929
05:47:35,460 --> 05:47:36,140
I'm paranoid.

4930
05:47:36,160 --> 05:47:40,370
Oh no, not paragon.

4931
05:47:42,090 --> 05:47:42,790
Ok, hold on.

4932
05:47:42,810 --> 05:47:44,390
Sorry, I'm eating this piece of chicken.

4933
05:47:44,870 --> 05:47:45,350
Give me a sec.

4934
05:47:57,960 --> 05:47:59,180
Oh my god.

4935
05:48:01,740 --> 05:48:04,500
She really just do be coming at me.

4936
05:48:04,960 --> 05:48:05,560
First thing.

4937
05:48:06,640 --> 05:48:07,020
Snow!

4938
05:48:08,840 --> 05:48:09,960
My backpack.

4939
05:48:12,040 --> 05:48:13,800
Let's do...

4940
05:48:13,800 --> 05:48:14,920
This.

4941
05:48:20,180 --> 05:48:21,060
Yeah,

4942
05:48:25,590 --> 05:48:26,870
I have life medicine still.

4943
05:48:28,350 --> 05:48:29,810
My thermal goggles.

4944
05:48:40,920 --> 05:48:42,760
Oh wait, I should have shot her there.

4945
05:48:42,820 --> 05:48:43,380
I'm so dumb.

4946
05:48:49,600 --> 05:48:52,580
I didn't realize she braked for so long.

4947
05:48:53,440 --> 05:48:55,280
Ok, good to know.

4948
05:49:00,940 --> 05:49:01,700
Where is she?

4949
05:49:04,120 --> 05:49:04,840
Where is she?

4950
05:49:05,000 --> 05:49:05,280
Where is she?

4951
05:49:05,340 --> 05:49:05,460
Where did she go?

4952
05:49:06,240 --> 05:49:06,660
Ma'am?

4953
05:49:07,700 --> 05:49:08,140
Mom?

4954
05:49:08,320 --> 05:49:08,820
Sorry, mom?

4955
05:49:08,980 --> 05:49:09,220
Ma'am?

4956
05:49:11,000 --> 05:49:11,440
Lady?

4957
05:49:12,740 --> 05:49:13,800
Where did she go?

4958
05:49:15,260 --> 05:49:15,960
Oh, I see her.

4959
05:49:17,460 --> 05:49:19,460
I thought I saw... Oh, there she is.

4960
05:49:20,060 --> 05:49:20,300
No!

4961
05:49:21,700 --> 05:49:22,140
No!

4962
05:49:24,900 --> 05:49:25,340
Snake

4963
05:49:30,460 --> 05:49:30,700
run!

4964
05:49:31,060 --> 05:49:31,600
Snake run!

4965
05:49:45,920 --> 05:49:47,420
Uh oh, we are in a bad spot.

4966
05:49:47,880 --> 05:49:49,140
Because of the...

4967
05:49:50,020 --> 05:49:51,140
Wait, maybe actually...

4968
05:49:55,710 --> 05:49:56,430
Where is she?

4969
05:49:59,050 --> 05:50:00,310
Or am I hearing a snake?

4970
05:50:00,650 --> 05:50:01,350
What am I hearing?

4971
05:50:01,610 --> 05:50:02,890
Am I hearing her or a snake?

4972
05:50:03,050 --> 05:50:03,630
Oh, there she is.

4973
05:50:07,390 --> 05:50:08,490
I missed my shot.

4974
05:50:23,830 --> 05:50:24,850
There she is.

4975
05:50:29,020 --> 05:50:30,280
It's so quiet.

4976
05:50:33,540 --> 05:50:34,680
It's so quiet.

4977
05:50:35,620 --> 05:50:36,620
Makes me want to whisper.

4978
05:50:37,820 --> 05:50:38,280
Snake.

4979
05:50:40,180 --> 05:50:41,020
Where did she go?

4980
05:50:42,560 --> 05:50:43,440
Where did she go?

4981
05:50:45,480 --> 05:50:46,740
She is running.

4982
05:50:47,300 --> 05:50:48,460
Running, running, running.

4983
05:50:49,360 --> 05:50:50,460
Running, running, running.

4984
05:50:51,180 --> 05:50:51,920
Did she see me?

4985
05:50:52,060 --> 05:50:53,480
Oh my gosh, she is like right there.

4986
05:50:55,160 --> 05:50:55,560
Oh my god.

4987
05:50:56,120 --> 05:50:56,700
Snake the shot!

4988
05:50:59,240 --> 05:50:59,820
Got her.

4989
05:51:00,820 --> 05:51:02,020
Oh my god.

4990
05:51:02,680 --> 05:51:03,160
Oh my god.

4991
05:51:04,320 --> 05:51:04,580
Run.

4992
05:51:06,740 --> 05:51:08,860
Actually, maybe we are okay.

4993
05:51:18,560 --> 05:51:20,480
I hear her.

4994
05:51:21,560 --> 05:51:22,220
This way?

4995
05:51:26,100 --> 05:51:26,940
Maybe?

4996
05:51:27,860 --> 05:51:28,380
I heard her.

4997
05:51:28,860 --> 05:51:29,080
Maybe.

4998
05:51:33,680 --> 05:51:34,940
She is...

4999
05:51:35,540 --> 05:51:36,020
Somewhere?

5000
05:51:36,420 --> 05:51:36,900
Gosh.

5001
05:51:37,840 --> 05:51:39,180
It's so hard to see.

5002
05:51:43,090 --> 05:51:43,890
Oh, I see her.

5003
05:51:47,510 --> 05:51:51,590
This is a battle of the wits and patience.

5004
05:51:51,830 --> 05:51:52,550
Oh, there she is.

5005
05:51:53,030 --> 05:51:53,530
I think.

5006
05:51:54,350 --> 05:51:54,990
Am I crazy?

5007
05:51:55,210 --> 05:51:55,670
Oh my god.

5008
05:51:55,910 --> 05:51:56,950
Where the hell is she?

5009
05:51:57,790 --> 05:51:58,270
Guys!

5010
05:52:00,510 --> 05:52:00,990
Goggles?

5011
05:52:01,110 --> 05:52:01,970
Yeah, let's try them.

5012
05:52:04,570 --> 05:52:05,430
That's a snake.

5013
05:52:07,690 --> 05:52:08,930
That's also a snake.

5014
05:52:15,530 --> 05:52:18,310
You just call me pathetic and then you say he is good?

5015
05:52:18,910 --> 05:52:19,690
Which is it?

5016
05:52:19,990 --> 05:52:22,330
Yeah, which is it?

5017
05:52:28,820 --> 05:52:29,260
Oh my god.

5018
05:52:29,640 --> 05:52:30,460
Oh, shoot.

5019
05:52:31,820 --> 05:52:33,060
He is gone.

5020
05:52:34,460 --> 05:52:36,280
I'm just gonna...

5021
05:52:40,380 --> 05:52:41,060
Oh,

5022
05:52:45,210 --> 05:52:45,370
wait.

5023
05:52:47,410 --> 05:52:48,090
Gosh.

5024
05:52:49,490 --> 05:52:53,370
I forget that she has a break every time I do that.

5025
05:52:55,250 --> 05:52:55,930
Okay.

5026
05:52:56,830 --> 05:52:57,970
Let's bait her out.

5027
05:53:00,070 --> 05:53:01,790
Where did she go?

5028
05:53:03,250 --> 05:53:04,130
Is that her?

5029
05:53:04,650 --> 05:53:04,990
Yep.

5030
05:53:06,270 --> 05:53:06,950
Shit.

5031
05:53:08,350 --> 05:53:09,030
Shit.

5032
05:53:09,630 --> 05:53:10,930
I gotta be faster.

5033
05:53:11,130 --> 05:53:12,470
I gotta take more risks.

5034
05:53:13,090 --> 05:53:13,850
I gotta be faster.

5035
05:53:19,350 --> 05:53:20,330
Where is she?

5036
05:53:21,270 --> 05:53:22,290
Where is she?

5037
05:53:22,750 --> 05:53:23,670
Streamer, please.

5038
05:53:23,850 --> 05:53:25,690
I'm sorry.

5039
05:53:26,830 --> 05:53:27,950
I'm sorry.

5040
05:53:28,690 --> 05:53:29,710
I'm sorry.

5041
05:53:29,830 --> 05:53:30,190
I'm sorry.

5042
05:53:30,270 --> 05:53:31,090
Oh my god.

5043
05:53:34,410 --> 05:53:35,370
Oh, shit.

5044
05:53:38,590 --> 05:53:39,450
Oh my god.

5045
05:53:40,750 --> 05:53:41,930
Ah, shit.

5046
05:53:46,090 --> 05:53:47,110
Okay, come here.

5047
05:53:53,190 --> 05:53:54,390
Dang it.

5048
05:53:54,750 --> 05:53:55,890
I did not...

5049
05:53:55,890 --> 05:53:58,450
I didn't get the combo, guys.

5050
05:53:58,730 --> 05:53:59,390
Oh my god.

5051
05:53:59,510 --> 05:54:00,010
No, snake.

5052
05:54:05,460 --> 05:54:06,660
Holy moly.

5053
05:54:13,040 --> 05:54:14,080
Broken bone.

5054
05:54:14,080 --> 05:54:17,080
And what else bandage?

5055
05:54:20,800 --> 05:54:27,060
Yeah, I can't use... I'm trying for a non-lethal kill if you're telling me to use other stuff.

5056
05:54:27,500 --> 05:54:28,720
I'm not gonna listen.

5057
05:54:30,440 --> 05:54:33,460
I'm not gonna listen to you.

5058
05:54:34,000 --> 05:54:36,580
Cause I don't wanna actually kill her.

5059
05:54:39,180 --> 05:54:39,780
Can

5060
05:54:43,160 --> 05:54:44,160
I get her from here?

5061
05:54:44,840 --> 05:54:45,380
Where is she?

5062
05:54:46,000 --> 05:54:47,040
Wasn't she just right there?

5063
05:54:48,440 --> 05:54:49,120
Lady?

5064
05:54:50,160 --> 05:54:50,500
Wait.

5065
05:54:51,440 --> 05:54:51,700
Where

5066
05:54:58,450 --> 05:54:59,930
did you go?

5067
05:55:03,010 --> 05:55:04,290
Where did you go?

5068
05:55:04,430 --> 05:55:05,450
I can't see anything.

5069
05:55:05,990 --> 05:55:06,750
Holy cow.

5070
05:55:12,590 --> 05:55:14,090
Where is she?

5071
05:55:17,230 --> 05:55:19,990
Honestly, this fight just exhausts me every time.

5072
05:55:20,710 --> 05:55:22,550
It doesn't make me be like...

5073
05:55:22,550 --> 05:55:24,830
I'm just exhausted every time.

5074
05:55:30,470 --> 05:55:31,530
Where are you?

5075
05:55:31,630 --> 05:55:32,190
Oh, there she is.

5076
05:55:47,040 --> 05:55:48,340
It is a cinematic fight.

5077
05:55:48,540 --> 05:55:48,780
Indeed.

5078
05:55:49,940 --> 05:55:50,460
Indeed.

5079
05:55:54,720 --> 05:55:55,500
Where'd she go?

5080
05:55:56,100 --> 05:55:56,380
Here?

5081
05:56:00,590 --> 05:56:02,030
I have, haven't I?

5082
05:56:03,630 --> 05:56:04,410
Oh boy.

5083
05:56:10,570 --> 05:56:11,290
Oh my god.

5084
05:56:11,370 --> 05:56:12,290
I can't...

5085
05:56:17,190 --> 05:56:18,450
Please be behind this tree.

5086
05:56:21,690 --> 05:56:23,550
Please be behind... Oh, there she is.

5087
05:56:24,010 --> 05:56:24,790
Okay, I got her.

5088
05:56:39,290 --> 05:56:41,330
Is that the legendary?

5089
05:56:44,630 --> 05:56:45,430
Oh my gosh.

5090
05:56:45,570 --> 05:56:46,350
I can't, I can't.

5091
05:56:47,890 --> 05:56:49,930
Oh, oh.

5092
05:57:07,250 --> 05:57:07,990
Where'd she go?

5093
05:57:09,450 --> 05:57:11,730
I don't think this is the run either.

5094
05:57:12,230 --> 05:57:13,250
Oh, there she is.

5095
05:57:18,660 --> 05:57:19,920
Did she leave?

5096
05:57:20,580 --> 05:57:21,340
Oh, there she is.

5097
05:57:23,480 --> 05:57:25,380
I can't... I can't get her.

5098
05:57:31,560 --> 05:57:32,420
No, please.

5099
05:57:32,720 --> 05:57:34,020
No, no.

5100
05:57:34,240 --> 05:57:35,240
Don't make me...

5101
05:57:40,990 --> 05:57:41,650
Oh my god.

5102
05:57:41,890 --> 05:57:42,170
Please.

5103
05:57:47,390 --> 05:57:48,430
Got her, got her, got her.

5104
05:57:54,790 --> 05:57:55,710
Oh my god.

5105
05:57:55,770 --> 05:57:56,550
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5106
05:58:08,700 --> 05:58:09,020
Nice!

5107
05:58:10,020 --> 05:58:10,800
One more minute.

5108
05:58:31,160 --> 05:58:31,720
Oh my god.

5109
05:58:31,900 --> 05:58:32,580
Oh my god.

5110
05:58:32,780 --> 05:58:33,060
Oh my god.

5111
05:58:33,240 --> 05:58:33,680
Oh my god.

5112
05:58:33,800 --> 05:58:34,200
Oh my god.

5113
05:58:35,540 --> 05:58:36,300
I'm just trying.

5114
05:58:36,360 --> 05:58:37,120
I'm just trying anything.

5115
05:58:37,580 --> 05:58:38,240
I'm just... Come on!

5116
05:58:42,260 --> 05:58:42,860
Oh my god.

5117
05:58:42,900 --> 05:58:43,920
I can't even get a hit on her.

5118
05:58:44,360 --> 05:58:44,900
No, where'd she go?

5119
05:58:45,440 --> 05:58:46,020
Where'd she go?

5120
05:58:47,960 --> 05:58:48,280
No!

5121
05:58:49,900 --> 05:58:50,780
Where'd she go?

5122
05:58:53,760 --> 05:58:55,100
It's not throwing.

5123
05:58:55,280 --> 05:58:58,680
I don't know what... I'm just button mashing because I don't know what to do.

5124
05:59:08,520 --> 05:59:09,480
Come on!

5125
05:59:09,480 --> 05:59:10,740
Snake it out, please!

5126
05:59:10,740 --> 05:59:11,000
Please!

5127
05:59:17,420 --> 05:59:18,900
I tried to punch her.

5128
05:59:18,960 --> 05:59:19,920
She punched me back.

5129
05:59:20,000 --> 05:59:20,160
OK?

5130
05:59:23,340 --> 05:59:23,840
Man.

5131
05:59:27,880 --> 05:59:29,060
That was so close.

5132
05:59:38,360 --> 05:59:40,600
Not really in the mood for you guys.

5133
05:59:40,660 --> 05:59:40,920
OK?

5134
05:59:43,340 --> 05:59:47,200
Not really in the mood for you guys to...

5135
05:59:48,860 --> 05:59:50,380
rag on me so much.

5136
05:59:50,500 --> 05:59:51,860
Just, you know...

5137
05:59:58,720 --> 06:00:02,280
Sometimes I can play around, but sometimes I'm just...

5138
06:00:10,500 --> 06:00:12,360
There we go.

5139
06:00:28,390 --> 06:00:29,130
Yes.

5140
06:00:30,310 --> 06:00:30,650
OK.

5141
06:00:36,780 --> 06:00:37,140
OK.

5142
06:00:50,440 --> 06:00:52,140
And I'll shoot...Oh my god!

5143
06:00:52,420 --> 06:00:53,160
Wait, wait, wait!

5144
06:00:53,500 --> 06:00:55,120
You were supposed to be stunned for a second!

5145
06:00:55,220 --> 06:00:55,580
What happened?

5146
06:00:57,640 --> 06:00:59,100
What happened to my stun?

5147
06:01:03,220 --> 06:01:04,540
Oh my gosh.

5148
06:01:11,870 --> 06:01:12,430
What?

5149
06:01:12,430 --> 06:01:14,950
OK, what is the actual button?

5150
06:01:15,310 --> 06:01:17,170
So I'm not just spamming something.

5151
06:01:17,350 --> 06:01:19,110
If anybody...actually no.

5152
06:01:19,230 --> 06:01:21,470
Everybody is going to tell me different answers, so nevermind.

5153
06:01:30,620 --> 06:01:31,180
What?

5154
06:01:40,410 --> 06:01:40,630
Where?

5155
06:01:42,910 --> 06:01:45,050
Oh, I see her.

5156
06:01:45,750 --> 06:01:47,050
Oh, I saw her.

5157
06:01:50,430 --> 06:01:50,950
Pew!

5158
06:01:51,270 --> 06:01:51,510
Pew!

5159
06:01:52,110 --> 06:01:52,570
Pew!

5160
06:01:52,790 --> 06:01:52,890
Pew!

5161
06:01:53,190 --> 06:01:53,350
Pew!

5162
06:01:53,570 --> 06:01:56,070
Oh my god, I hate me trying to change the camera angle.

5163
06:02:14,610 --> 06:02:16,310
She's over here somewhere.

5164
06:02:16,570 --> 06:02:17,210
Wait, there she is.

5165
06:02:19,090 --> 06:02:19,750
Oh my god.

5166
06:02:20,450 --> 06:02:21,130
Got her.

5167
06:02:44,100 --> 06:02:48,740
With darkness and silence with an eye.

5168
06:02:51,140 --> 06:02:51,660
Oh.

5169
06:02:52,260 --> 06:02:53,020
Wait, where is she?

5170
06:02:53,960 --> 06:02:55,320
What a thrill.

5171
06:02:57,840 --> 06:02:59,220
Oh, there she is.

5172
06:02:59,620 --> 06:03:05,300
I'm searching and I'm melting to you.

5173
06:03:07,740 --> 06:03:09,220
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

5174
06:03:16,880 --> 06:03:17,380
Snake!

5175
06:03:18,320 --> 06:03:19,080
Snake get him!

5176
06:03:19,540 --> 06:03:20,100
I'm trying!

5177
06:03:23,880 --> 06:03:25,460
You run first.

5178
06:03:28,910 --> 06:03:30,070
She's over here.

5179
06:03:34,640 --> 06:03:35,520
Oh shoot.

5180
06:03:38,420 --> 06:03:39,680
There you are.

5181
06:03:39,740 --> 06:03:44,040
As if I haven't been staying behind the same tree for this entire time.

5182
06:03:44,640 --> 06:03:45,220
No!

5183
06:03:49,450 --> 06:03:50,890
Oh god!

5184
06:03:52,150 --> 06:03:52,830
Get up Snake!

5185
06:03:53,370 --> 06:03:53,810
Snake!

5186
06:03:55,070 --> 06:03:56,790
I'm trying to move!

5187
06:04:05,650 --> 06:04:06,810
Oh shoot!

5188
06:04:07,830 --> 06:04:08,790
Can I get her?

5189
06:04:08,950 --> 06:04:09,130
Nope.

5190
06:04:09,470 --> 06:04:11,510
It was worth a shot I suppose.

5191
06:04:17,350 --> 06:04:18,710
Get her!

5192
06:04:19,650 --> 06:04:20,330
Nice!

5193
06:04:20,470 --> 06:04:20,850
Good job Snake!

5194
06:04:22,070 --> 06:04:23,550
Good job Watashi!

5195
06:04:28,050 --> 06:04:28,350
Nice!

5196
06:04:34,230 --> 06:04:35,890
Oh wait, you're coming back!

5197
06:04:40,010 --> 06:04:41,350
I think I'm down.

5198
06:04:43,630 --> 06:04:44,750
Get up Snake!

5199
06:04:47,150 --> 06:04:48,330
Oh my gosh.

5200
06:04:48,510 --> 06:04:49,030
Oh my gosh.

5201
06:04:49,670 --> 06:04:50,530
Oh please, mommy.

5202
06:04:51,090 --> 06:04:52,090
Please, let me have a chance.

5203
06:04:52,330 --> 06:04:53,230
Let me have a fighting chance.

5204
06:04:57,680 --> 06:04:59,500
I love you.

5205
06:05:07,140 --> 06:05:08,020
Mommy!

5206
06:05:09,240 --> 06:05:09,680
Mommy!

5207
06:05:17,240 --> 06:05:17,720
Where is she?

5208
06:05:18,260 --> 06:05:18,800
Oh shoot.

5209
06:05:42,660 --> 06:05:45,220
Gotta let her not see me.

5210
06:05:52,240 --> 06:05:53,260
Oh shoot.

5211
06:05:54,640 --> 06:05:55,980
No, not...

5212
06:05:59,360 --> 06:06:00,980
How are you avoiding these?

5213
06:06:03,940 --> 06:06:04,620
No!

5214
06:06:16,400 --> 06:06:19,660
Oh please, please, oh please, please, please god!

5215
06:06:21,420 --> 06:06:23,600
I hate this fucking game!

5216
06:06:24,300 --> 06:06:24,980
Fuck you!

5217
06:06:25,580 --> 06:06:26,240
Fuck you!

5218
06:06:34,070 --> 06:06:35,650
Behind the smallest tree ever?

5219
06:06:35,990 --> 06:06:36,390
Oh my god.

5220
06:06:36,710 --> 06:06:37,690
Behind the smallest tree ever?

5221
06:06:47,170 --> 06:06:50,730
Why can't you shoot me but I can't shoot you?

5222
06:06:51,410 --> 06:06:52,390
This is such bullshit!

5223
06:06:53,090 --> 06:06:53,650
You're cheating!

5224
06:06:54,110 --> 06:06:55,170
You're cheating for real.

5225
06:06:58,640 --> 06:06:59,480
Where'd she go?

5226
06:07:11,330 --> 06:07:12,210
Where'd she go?

5227
06:07:16,340 --> 06:07:17,060
Where'd she go?

5228
06:07:17,200 --> 06:07:17,960
Oh there she is.

5229
06:07:21,860 --> 06:07:22,700
Oh fucking...

5230
06:07:31,170 --> 06:07:37,770
It's so frustrating because this is supposed to be such a cinematic emotional fight and here I am just being like, you bitch!

5231
06:07:38,270 --> 06:07:38,950
You bitch!

5232
06:07:51,690 --> 06:07:52,710
Come on, get up Snake.

5233
06:07:59,650 --> 06:08:01,070
Please, behind the tree.

5234
06:08:03,090 --> 06:08:05,490
Preferable, preferably behind... I don't even know where she is.

5235
06:08:05,590 --> 06:08:06,150
Oh my god.

5236
06:08:18,500 --> 06:08:19,280
How'd you see me?

5237
06:08:20,580 --> 06:08:22,080
Is it because I'm all bloody now?

5238
06:08:25,080 --> 06:08:26,320
Oh my god, ma'am.

5239
06:08:27,000 --> 06:08:28,400
Ma'am, you're so close.

5240
06:08:34,490 --> 06:08:35,170
Where'd she go?

5241
06:08:35,570 --> 06:08:40,670
Oh my god, just one hit left.

5242
06:08:42,390 --> 06:08:44,310
Ok, I'm gonna go in for it.

5243
06:08:44,310 --> 06:08:47,310
What a thrill...

5244
06:08:48,770 --> 06:08:51,310
With darkness inside...

5245
06:08:59,570 --> 06:09:05,730
Right now I'm melting to you...

5246
06:09:05,730 --> 06:09:09,810
Oh my god, what a feeling in my heart...

5247
06:09:09,810 --> 06:09:10,410
Where are you?

5248
06:09:11,770 --> 06:09:12,750
I'm trying to punch her.

5249
06:09:15,790 --> 06:09:17,310
Where are you?

5250
06:09:25,080 --> 06:09:26,880
Why do you mean it's not yours?

5251
06:09:27,480 --> 06:09:27,840
Why?

5252
06:09:28,820 --> 06:09:29,380
Oh shit.

5253
06:09:37,520 --> 06:09:38,120
Why?

5254
06:09:38,340 --> 06:09:38,880
Why me?

5255
06:09:39,580 --> 06:09:40,240
Why me?

5256
06:09:42,460 --> 06:09:43,480
I'm trying!

5257
06:09:47,600 --> 06:09:50,240
I think I should have gotten her in that one hit though.

5258
06:09:53,580 --> 06:09:56,320
I think I should have gotten her in that one hit though.

5259
06:10:05,400 --> 06:10:07,500
I can't believe she shoots on my bullets.

5260
06:10:17,480 --> 06:10:18,100
Where'd she go?

5261
06:10:18,100 --> 06:10:18,940
Oh no.

5262
06:10:22,360 --> 06:10:33,940
I got it!

5263
06:10:34,220 --> 06:10:34,920
I got her!

5264
06:10:36,080 --> 06:10:41,820
Someday you'll be on a dream road...

5265
06:10:41,820 --> 06:10:48,200
To survive...

5266
06:10:48,200 --> 06:10:53,500
For the day we see new light...

5267
06:10:53,500 --> 06:10:54,380
We did it.

5268
06:10:58,600 --> 06:11:00,600
Ok, now back to being sad.

5269
06:11:03,240 --> 06:11:04,700
Back to being sad.

5270
06:11:06,840 --> 06:11:08,660
The philosopher's legacy.

5271
06:11:13,820 --> 06:11:15,900
We did it but at what cost?

5272
06:11:15,980 --> 06:11:16,260
No!

5273
06:11:17,780 --> 06:11:18,240
No!

5274
06:11:22,920 --> 06:11:23,560
Boss, no.

5275
06:11:23,900 --> 06:11:24,440
I don't want it.

5276
06:11:24,520 --> 06:11:24,880
I don't want it.

5277
06:11:24,980 --> 06:11:25,560
I don't want it.

5278
06:11:42,040 --> 06:11:43,740
This song kills me.

5279
06:12:04,500 --> 06:12:07,220
There's only room for one boss.

5280
06:12:08,200 --> 06:12:09,260
And one snake.

5281
06:12:12,560 --> 06:12:13,400
No!

5282
06:12:16,360 --> 06:12:17,200
No!

5283
06:12:36,660 --> 06:12:37,500
Ok.

5284
06:12:41,650 --> 06:12:44,850
Yeah, if we wait long enough maybe...

5285
06:12:44,850 --> 06:12:46,270
The game will change.

5286
06:12:47,270 --> 06:12:49,710
Oh my

5287
06:13:05,090 --> 06:13:05,910
god, FPS.

5288
06:13:05,910 --> 06:13:08,070
Good luck, PS2.

5289
06:13:30,990 --> 06:13:34,250
If her horse shows up, I'm gonna lose it.

5290
06:13:48,570 --> 06:13:50,190
The horse is here.

5291
06:14:07,840 --> 06:14:08,660
Symbolism.

5292
06:14:18,410 --> 06:14:21,190
During the boss fight though...

5293
06:14:23,030 --> 06:14:26,190
More than Snake Eater, I think of...

5294
06:14:26,750 --> 06:14:27,470
Heaven's Divide.

5295
06:14:28,630 --> 06:14:31,190
Like the first couple lines of Heaven's Divide.

5296
06:14:47,720 --> 06:14:49,420
It ties in so perfectly with this.

5297
06:14:49,600 --> 06:14:49,920
It does.

5298
06:14:50,160 --> 06:14:51,620
Such a perfect song.

5299
06:15:00,420 --> 06:15:02,880
What a damn good game.

5300
06:15:03,100 --> 06:15:04,080
It's not over yet.

5301
06:15:04,880 --> 06:15:07,900
We still have one last mini boss.

5302
06:15:12,420 --> 06:15:13,620
Ah yeah.

5303
06:15:14,000 --> 06:15:14,940
Well, not really.

5304
06:15:15,180 --> 06:15:16,360
Snake is so poor.

5305
06:15:16,920 --> 06:15:18,280
Poor man.

5306
06:15:24,080 --> 06:15:25,040
I don't think...

5307
06:15:25,040 --> 06:15:26,820
Eva, please.

5308
06:15:27,500 --> 06:15:29,300
Eva, let him grieve.

5309
06:15:48,580 --> 06:15:50,260
Here he comes.

5310
06:15:50,940 --> 06:15:52,480
Being such a stupid cat.

5311
06:15:57,200 --> 06:15:59,120
You can relax now, Snake.

5312
06:16:02,920 --> 06:16:05,180
Not this goofy-ass smile.

5313
06:16:07,080 --> 06:16:09,060
We're not done yet, Snake.

5314
06:16:13,010 --> 06:16:14,130
What happened?

5315
06:16:16,950 --> 06:16:19,050
Eva, you said you could fly this thing.

5316
06:16:28,330 --> 06:16:30,630
I sure hope not.

5317
06:16:35,550 --> 06:16:36,570
Oh my gosh.

5318
06:16:37,170 --> 06:16:38,410
Let him in, Snake.

5319
06:16:38,490 --> 06:16:39,190
Let him in.

5320
06:16:39,710 --> 06:16:40,550
If he's cold.

5321
06:16:40,650 --> 06:16:41,990
If you're cold, he's cold.

5322
06:17:19,580 --> 06:17:21,040
That's a lot of big boy.

5323
06:17:23,500 --> 06:17:25,440
That's a lot of big, big boy.

5324
06:17:27,620 --> 06:17:27,980
Ew.

5325
06:17:31,500 --> 06:17:33,180
Oh my God.

5326
06:17:33,740 --> 06:17:34,740
Oh my God.

5327
06:17:35,040 --> 06:17:35,680
Oh my God.

5328
06:17:40,660 --> 06:17:42,660
They're so...

5329
06:17:42,660 --> 06:17:44,080
Two of...Oh gosh.

5330
06:17:45,480 --> 06:17:48,120
Two of them are just such boys.

5331
06:17:55,710 --> 06:17:56,550
No.

5332
06:18:00,090 --> 06:18:01,590
That stance.

5333
06:18:03,330 --> 06:18:04,490
Oh God.

5334
06:18:06,150 --> 06:18:07,910
He's always pointing at him.

5335
06:18:10,810 --> 06:18:12,810
We're not gonna make it.

5336
06:18:13,890 --> 06:18:14,790
Eject Eva.

5337
06:18:17,750 --> 06:18:20,610
I'm sure Ocelot knows how to fly this thing.

5338
06:18:25,760 --> 06:18:27,520
Now they're just playing.

5339
06:18:27,760 --> 06:18:29,360
Now they're just playing around.

5340
06:18:29,360 --> 06:18:30,680
Look at that.

5341
06:18:33,520 --> 06:18:34,640
Oh God.

5342
06:18:34,960 --> 06:18:36,340
He looks so excited.

5343
06:18:38,280 --> 06:18:39,540
They're just dancing.

5344
06:18:44,960 --> 06:18:45,600
Curling

5345
06:18:53,590 --> 06:18:54,010
fingers.

5346
06:18:54,210 --> 06:18:54,470
Oh my God.

5347
06:18:54,490 --> 06:18:55,190
He's smiling.

5348
06:18:55,470 --> 06:18:56,570
He's having so much fun.

5349
06:18:56,570 --> 06:18:57,510
Oh my God.

5350
06:19:08,290 --> 06:19:10,430
Eva's like, please take care of this.

5351
06:19:12,390 --> 06:19:13,490
She's like, please.

5352
06:19:14,170 --> 06:19:16,970
We are literally going to run into the mountains.

5353
06:19:26,760 --> 06:19:27,950
Oh my God.

5354
06:19:33,630 --> 06:19:34,670
The tension.

5355
06:19:34,950 --> 06:19:38,050
That scene is just...

5356
06:19:38,050 --> 06:19:39,150
Oh, it's so good.

5357
06:19:39,290 --> 06:19:40,330
God, it's so good.

5358
06:19:40,730 --> 06:19:41,930
Oh, it's so good.

5359
06:19:42,210 --> 06:19:43,250
Oh my God.

5360
06:19:45,930 --> 06:19:47,350
Oh my God, please.

5361
06:19:53,770 --> 06:19:54,730
So good.

5362
06:19:55,030 --> 06:19:55,710
So good.

5363
06:19:56,330 --> 06:19:56,850
Oh my God.

5364
06:19:57,570 --> 06:19:58,630
I'm gonna throw up.

5365
06:19:59,050 --> 06:19:59,850
I just ate.

5366
06:20:00,710 --> 06:20:03,150
I'm gonna throw up because I'm so excited right now.

5367
06:20:03,510 --> 06:20:08,030
He trusts him.

5368
06:20:14,050 --> 06:20:17,210
Okay, so it's in the left... Right?

5369
06:20:17,390 --> 06:20:18,590
It's in his left hand.

5370
06:20:18,950 --> 06:20:20,050
The one with the bullet.

5371
06:20:21,010 --> 06:20:24,590
But it's always fun to get the one in the right hand, right?

5372
06:20:24,590 --> 06:20:28,730
Yeah, I went get him when he smirks and I blamed you.

5373
06:20:41,660 --> 06:20:42,880
Which one should we go?

5374
06:20:53,240 --> 06:20:54,600
Don't say it, Ocelot.

5375
06:20:54,660 --> 06:20:55,620
You're gonna ruin my immersion.

5376
06:20:57,660 --> 06:20:57,860
No!

5377
06:20:59,820 --> 06:21:01,520
You are an Ocelot.

5378
06:21:01,520 --> 06:21:04,260
Adamska!

5379
06:21:11,260 --> 06:21:11,960
John!

5380
06:21:13,460 --> 06:21:19,240
I know you will.

5381
06:21:24,520 --> 06:21:25,420
John!

5382
06:21:25,840 --> 06:21:26,040
John!

5383
06:21:26,040 --> 06:21:26,340
Okay.

5384
06:21:31,870 --> 06:21:33,460
Alright guys.

5385
06:21:44,070 --> 06:21:45,970
Pick one up already.

5386
06:21:49,470 --> 06:21:51,810
Let's just...should we go for the right one?

5387
06:21:53,450 --> 06:21:53,830
No.

5388
06:21:56,590 --> 06:21:57,370
Which one?

5389
06:21:58,410 --> 06:22:00,090
Hold on, I'm thinking.

5390
06:22:00,890 --> 06:22:02,150
I'm observing.

5391
06:22:03,430 --> 06:22:04,110
Hold on!

5392
06:22:04,950 --> 06:22:05,950
I'm sniffing them.

5393
06:22:06,870 --> 06:22:07,890
Pick one!

5394
06:22:08,650 --> 06:22:13,390
Have you lost your nerve?

5395
06:22:15,010 --> 06:22:17,790
What are you doing?

5396
06:22:20,810 --> 06:22:23,810
Pick one up already.

5397
06:22:26,710 --> 06:22:27,870
Pick one!

5398
06:22:29,730 --> 06:22:33,510
Have you lost your nerve?

5399
06:22:33,510 --> 06:22:35,170
Which gun?

5400
06:22:35,590 --> 06:22:35,950
Left?

5401
06:22:36,490 --> 06:22:36,830
Right?

5402
06:22:39,110 --> 06:22:40,610
He is so impatient.

5403
06:22:42,930 --> 06:22:44,070
Alright, pick guys.

5404
06:22:44,150 --> 06:22:45,030
Pick, pick, pick.

5405
06:22:49,190 --> 06:22:50,310
Vote in the poll!

5406
06:22:50,690 --> 06:22:51,470
Vote in the poll!

5407
06:22:51,690 --> 06:22:52,450
Vote in the poll!

5408
06:22:58,210 --> 06:22:59,230
Kiss him.

5409
06:22:59,910 --> 06:23:00,570
If only.

5410
06:23:01,370 --> 06:23:02,830
Wait, why is it 50-50?

5411
06:23:03,450 --> 06:23:04,810
Wait you guys, it's 50-50.

5412
06:23:04,910 --> 06:23:05,990
What am I supposed to do?

5413
06:23:07,210 --> 06:23:07,670
Wait!

5414
06:23:08,250 --> 06:23:08,890
Oh my god.

5415
06:23:08,990 --> 06:23:09,310
Stop!

5416
06:23:10,770 --> 06:23:11,230
Stop!

5417
06:23:12,850 --> 06:23:14,870
Okay, I'm gonna close it.

5418
06:23:15,570 --> 06:23:16,150
Let's see.

5419
06:23:16,370 --> 06:23:17,430
Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes.

5420
06:23:18,130 --> 06:23:21,850
I'm gonna close my eyes and whichever one wins, I'm gonna count down from ten.

5421
06:23:22,270 --> 06:23:25,510
Whichever one is more, I'm gonna do it.

5422
06:23:25,510 --> 06:23:26,750
Okay, so...

5423
06:23:27,390 --> 06:23:27,410
Ten!

5424
06:23:28,090 --> 06:23:28,450
Nine!

5425
06:23:29,050 --> 06:23:29,350
Eight!

5426
06:23:30,010 --> 06:23:30,330
Seven!

5427
06:23:31,010 --> 06:23:31,330
Six!

5428
06:23:31,870 --> 06:23:32,310
Five!

5429
06:23:32,890 --> 06:23:33,210
Four!

5430
06:23:34,450 --> 06:23:35,410
Three!

5431
06:23:36,030 --> 06:23:36,450
Two!

5432
06:23:36,930 --> 06:23:37,450
One!

5433
06:23:38,430 --> 06:23:38,890
Left!

5434
06:23:49,370 --> 06:23:51,910
Pick one up already.

5435
06:23:52,350 --> 06:23:53,230
What are you doing?

5436
06:23:56,230 --> 06:23:57,670
Oh my god.

5437
06:24:00,710 --> 06:24:02,410
It was almost 50-50.

5438
06:24:02,550 --> 06:24:03,070
It was close.

5439
06:24:03,170 --> 06:24:03,750
It was close.

5440
06:24:19,600 --> 06:24:20,720
What if I don't shoot?

5441
06:24:28,830 --> 06:24:29,630
What are you doing?

5442
06:24:30,010 --> 06:24:30,790
What are you doing buddy?

5443
06:24:34,090 --> 06:24:35,290
Spin the gun!

5444
06:24:37,530 --> 06:24:38,870
No, I can't do it.

5445
06:24:40,170 --> 06:24:41,210
It's no good.

5446
06:24:41,610 --> 06:24:42,530
I can't do it.

5447
06:24:56,960 --> 06:24:59,800
Looks like your luck has beat mine again.

5448
06:25:02,040 --> 06:25:03,700
But why didn't you pull the trigger?

5449
06:25:07,470 --> 06:25:10,350
God, he says so much with no words.

5450
06:25:11,970 --> 06:25:12,650
Ah, well.

5451
06:25:13,930 --> 06:25:14,570
Ah, well.

5452
06:25:19,050 --> 06:25:20,290
Until we meet again.

5453
06:25:20,690 --> 06:25:21,110
Yeah.

5454
06:25:21,570 --> 06:25:22,050
John.

5455
06:25:22,530 --> 06:25:23,410
Don't jump out that.

5456
06:25:23,510 --> 06:25:23,830
You'll die.

5457
06:25:23,830 --> 06:25:24,810
Oh...

5458
06:25:27,500 --> 06:25:29,870
What is wrong with you Azula?

5459
06:25:30,190 --> 06:25:31,670
You are going to die!

5460
06:25:36,130 --> 06:25:37,770
God, they're...

5461
06:25:41,550 --> 06:25:42,370
No.

5462
06:25:50,620 --> 06:25:53,010
I took too long didn't I?

5463
06:25:53,010 --> 06:25:56,690
I just couldn't... I couldn't let the moment end.

5464
06:26:17,510 --> 06:26:21,190
Eva gave up so that we would stop having a moment, you know?

5465
06:26:21,930 --> 06:26:23,190
Make sure to breathe boss.

5466
06:26:23,850 --> 06:26:24,590
I can't.

5467
06:26:24,610 --> 06:26:25,610
They took my breath away.

5468
06:26:26,930 --> 06:26:27,910
I never breathe.

5469
06:26:27,990 --> 06:26:28,430
I'm dead.

5470
06:26:29,450 --> 06:26:30,490
Oh my god, the awkward laugh.

5471
06:26:46,940 --> 06:26:47,580
Uh...

5472
06:26:47,580 --> 06:26:48,580
Oh

5473
06:26:59,830 --> 06:27:05,710
no.

5474
06:27:12,130 --> 06:27:12,450
Nix!

5475
06:27:21,450 --> 06:27:22,770
There's no way out.

5476
06:27:23,210 --> 06:27:23,950
What are we going to do?

5477
06:27:24,150 --> 06:27:25,210
Final boss!

5478
06:27:25,910 --> 06:27:26,910
Part 7!

5479
06:27:30,610 --> 06:27:32,730
Those things got to be armed.

5480
06:27:33,130 --> 06:27:33,970
It's no use.

5481
06:27:34,110 --> 06:27:35,730
There's no way we can outmaneuver them.

5482
06:27:36,730 --> 06:27:38,010
Uh oh.

5483
06:27:40,840 --> 06:27:50,360
Oh no.

5484
06:27:59,140 --> 06:28:00,540
Her

5485
06:28:06,040 --> 06:28:08,120
eyes are so wide.

5486
06:28:20,800 --> 06:28:21,800
Holy...

5487
06:28:22,920 --> 06:28:25,040
He's screaming at them.

5488
06:28:25,560 --> 06:28:26,360
Don't shoot!

5489
06:28:27,360 --> 06:28:28,480
Don't shoot!

5490
06:28:29,860 --> 06:28:31,120
My Robin T.

5491
06:28:31,260 --> 06:28:31,760
Titans.

5492
06:28:38,700 --> 06:28:42,100
His smile is just too much for me.

5493
06:28:51,270 --> 06:28:51,710
Codexed.

5494
06:28:53,830 --> 06:28:55,070
Well done, Snake.

5495
06:28:55,590 --> 06:28:56,210
The Migs disengaged.

5496
06:28:57,150 --> 06:28:59,030
Most likely under orders from Khrushchev.

5497
06:28:59,210 --> 06:29:00,870
Is this his way of helping us?

5498
06:29:01,190 --> 06:29:01,850
Who knows?

5499
06:29:02,170 --> 06:29:05,010
Maybe he didn't want things to get messier than they already are.

5500
06:29:05,070 --> 06:29:06,970
Or maybe he just wanted us to owe him one.

5501
06:29:07,430 --> 06:29:10,090
The important thing is, you made it out alive.

5502
06:29:10,450 --> 06:29:13,690
As long as Khrushchev is with us, I don't think they'll be coming after you.

5503
06:29:14,290 --> 06:29:16,290
It should be smooth sailing all the way to Alaska.

5504
06:29:16,290 --> 06:29:19,870
When did the whores have been bombed by the Migs?

5505
06:29:22,330 --> 06:29:24,190
They just never go through with the bombing.

5506
06:29:26,750 --> 06:29:28,890
That guy, he always keeps you waiting.

5507
06:30:00,270 --> 06:30:02,710
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

5508
06:30:04,570 --> 06:30:05,730
You didn't mean to.

5509
06:30:07,630 --> 06:30:10,770
Yeah, this game always makes me feel terrible.

5510
06:30:15,260 --> 06:30:18,360
It's never like a celebratory...

5511
06:30:19,060 --> 06:30:19,880
Oh boy.

5512
06:30:20,240 --> 06:30:20,480
Wait.

5513
06:30:21,420 --> 06:30:23,200
Wait, I'm too... Wait.

5514
06:30:23,480 --> 06:30:24,020
Oh gosh.

5515
06:30:29,880 --> 06:30:30,480
Guys,

5516
06:30:33,720 --> 06:30:36,560
it's time for all of us to collectively third wheel.

5517
06:30:37,700 --> 06:30:38,640
I love this song though.

5518
06:30:42,540 --> 06:30:44,080
I can't go back.

5519
06:30:44,320 --> 06:30:46,000
I left America behind me.

5520
06:30:47,460 --> 06:30:50,780
You saved this country.

5521
06:30:50,860 --> 06:30:56,240
Did he shower?

5522
06:30:57,260 --> 06:30:59,980
Do you think he brushed his teeth?

5523
06:31:00,640 --> 06:31:02,800
He's got little bat wings in his teeth.

5524
06:31:13,520 --> 06:31:15,460
Or is it an invitation?

5525
06:31:21,120 --> 06:31:23,220
God, she's so beautiful.

5526
06:31:23,400 --> 06:31:24,380
Or a proposal?

5527
06:31:24,660 --> 06:31:26,520
Oh my god, she's so beautiful.

5528
06:31:27,260 --> 06:31:28,920
Oh, she's so beautiful.

5529
06:31:29,280 --> 06:31:31,040
I don't take orders from anyone now.

5530
06:31:44,980 --> 06:31:45,680
No.

5531
06:32:02,800 --> 06:32:04,200
I can't.

5532
06:32:04,200 --> 06:32:04,880
I can't watch.

5533
06:32:07,800 --> 06:32:08,980
She's so beautiful.

5534
06:32:12,160 --> 06:32:13,180
Oh my god.

5535
06:32:13,860 --> 06:32:15,000
We know you can see through that.

5536
06:32:15,120 --> 06:32:16,180
Okay, you got me.

5537
06:32:17,560 --> 06:32:18,560
You got me.

5538
06:32:20,000 --> 06:32:20,440
Throw

5539
06:32:24,590 --> 06:32:25,370
it in the fire!

5540
06:32:25,910 --> 06:32:26,330
Yeah!

5541
06:32:36,700 --> 06:32:38,500
They're just both so sexy.

5542
06:32:39,740 --> 06:32:40,640
Oh my god.

5543
06:32:40,820 --> 06:32:42,000
He opens his eyes.

5544
06:32:42,940 --> 06:32:44,420
Snake keeps his eyes open.

5545
06:32:44,860 --> 06:32:45,300
Oh my god.

5546
06:32:50,900 --> 06:32:53,400
And then the rest was in my fanfiction.

5547
06:32:57,590 --> 06:32:58,720
Oh my god.

5548
06:33:00,820 --> 06:33:02,060
Pants on.

5549
06:33:05,800 --> 06:33:06,660
Link?

5550
06:33:08,180 --> 06:33:09,740
Not the apple.

5551
06:33:10,420 --> 06:33:11,380
Oh my gosh, imagery.

5552
06:33:12,240 --> 06:33:13,100
Symbolism.

5553
06:33:20,020 --> 06:33:21,920
What do you mean by that, Spank?

5554
06:33:26,720 --> 06:33:28,240
Here we go.

5555
06:33:34,520 --> 06:33:37,320
Dun-dun.

5556
06:33:41,040 --> 06:33:42,540
This poor guy.

5557
06:33:47,080 --> 06:33:50,460
This poor guy.

5558
06:34:02,030 --> 06:34:03,430
Just...

5559
06:34:03,430 --> 06:34:05,110
He got a checkie.

5560
06:34:20,590 --> 06:34:21,110
Good morning.

5561
06:34:30,810 --> 06:34:33,290
The creepy music.

5562
06:34:33,930 --> 06:34:34,610
So creepy.

5563
06:34:45,550 --> 06:34:47,570
That's why she had that gun!

5564
06:34:47,570 --> 06:34:49,890
It was all a lie.

5565
06:34:50,350 --> 06:34:51,210
Eva!

5566
06:34:53,450 --> 06:34:55,730
Everybody is tricking me.

5567
06:34:56,550 --> 06:34:57,450
Not you too.

5568
06:35:03,090 --> 06:35:05,990
You said that we could trust you.

5569
06:35:06,210 --> 06:35:06,550
Eva!

5570
06:35:09,430 --> 06:35:10,720
You said...

5571
06:35:11,150 --> 06:35:13,030
I speaved.

5572
06:35:14,570 --> 06:35:15,550
He believed.

5573
06:35:16,510 --> 06:35:17,750
She lied.

5574
06:35:20,490 --> 06:35:22,470
Yeah, and he just kind of...

5575
06:35:25,390 --> 06:35:28,110
He just said the whole location.

5576
06:35:41,250 --> 06:35:42,090
That...

5577
06:35:42,090 --> 06:35:45,010
Is actually...is that ever explained?

5578
06:35:45,010 --> 06:35:47,010
Or did he?

5579
06:35:52,610 --> 06:35:53,610
Or did he?

5580
06:35:53,810 --> 06:35:57,470
Dun-dun-dun.

5581
06:36:00,090 --> 06:36:01,850
You guys...

5582
06:36:01,850 --> 06:36:05,690
You guys...

5583
06:36:05,690 --> 06:36:07,010
We're not there yet.

5584
06:36:07,610 --> 06:36:08,910
We're not there yet.

5585
06:36:15,030 --> 06:36:15,490
What?

5586
06:36:29,870 --> 06:36:30,610
It's ok.

5587
06:36:33,390 --> 06:36:34,310
It's ok guys.

5588
06:36:34,430 --> 06:36:34,950
Don't worry about it.

5589
06:36:36,490 --> 06:36:37,310
We're almost there.

5590
06:36:37,650 --> 06:36:38,970
We're basically at the end.

5591
06:36:38,970 --> 06:36:41,030
Everything has gone according to plan.

5592
06:36:41,550 --> 06:36:42,490
Thanks to your help.

5593
06:36:43,950 --> 06:36:44,890
Oh, a snake.

5594
06:36:46,390 --> 06:36:48,330
I too am one of the philosophers.

5595
06:36:49,690 --> 06:36:53,570
I'm an agent of the philosophers, a graduate of one of their charm schools.

5596
06:36:55,550 --> 06:36:56,130
Charm schools?

5597
06:36:58,750 --> 06:36:59,990
She played us?

5598
06:37:00,090 --> 06:37:02,070
Oh, like a damn fiddle she did.

5599
06:37:02,070 --> 06:37:04,410
Back then, they were collecting children from all over the world.

5600
06:37:05,490 --> 06:37:08,630
As a result, I'm indistinguishable from a native-born American.

5601
06:37:08,630 --> 06:37:12,390
So it didn't surprise me when you and Volgin couldn't tell the difference.

5602
06:37:14,090 --> 06:37:14,570
But...

5603
06:37:14,570 --> 06:37:16,410
She knew right from the beginning.

5604
06:37:17,450 --> 06:37:22,590
She knew because before the war, she was at one of the philosophers' schools too as an instructor.

5605
06:37:24,070 --> 06:37:26,390
The boss was the only one I couldn't fool.

5606
06:37:27,630 --> 06:37:30,110
She was the only one who knew I was a fake.

5607
06:37:31,310 --> 06:37:32,570
Snake looks so good in that outfit.

5608
06:37:32,570 --> 06:37:34,070
She told me everything.

5609
06:37:34,070 --> 06:37:38,070
Why did she open her heart to me like that?

5610
06:37:38,990 --> 06:37:41,230
At the time, I couldn't understand it.

5611
06:37:42,770 --> 06:37:44,850
But now, I think I do.

5612
06:37:46,490 --> 06:37:47,050
Snake...

5613
06:37:47,810 --> 06:37:49,990
She wanted you to know the truth.

5614
06:37:51,470 --> 06:37:53,570
She chose me to tell you.

5615
06:37:55,570 --> 06:37:57,330
That's why she saved my life.

5616
06:37:59,210 --> 06:38:02,430
I've lied to you so many times, but not this time.

5617
06:38:02,430 --> 06:38:04,450
Did you lie about...

5618
06:38:06,330 --> 06:38:08,950
Saying that I tasted like a wild beast?

5619
06:38:15,710 --> 06:38:16,670
Eva!

5620
06:38:18,590 --> 06:38:19,550
Eva!

5621
06:38:22,590 --> 06:38:23,550
Creepy.

5622
06:38:29,720 --> 06:38:30,680
Everybody...

5623
06:38:30,680 --> 06:38:32,520
Everybody falls in love with a legend.

5624
06:38:35,660 --> 06:38:39,340
But because I made a promise to the boss...

5625
06:38:40,000 --> 06:38:41,340
And I intend to keep it.

5626
06:38:43,920 --> 06:38:45,520
I just wanted you to know.

5627
06:38:48,100 --> 06:38:48,660
And...

5628
06:38:49,240 --> 06:38:50,980
You have to live.

5629
06:38:53,220 --> 06:38:53,780
Kazuhira...Eva...

5630
06:38:56,040 --> 06:38:56,600
Snake,

5631
06:39:10,970 --> 06:39:11,630
are you okay?

5632
06:39:15,530 --> 06:39:16,130
Snake...

5633
06:39:17,590 --> 06:39:18,870
Snake, are you okay?

5634
06:39:19,250 --> 06:39:21,770
I'm not okay, oh god...

5635
06:39:21,770 --> 06:39:23,630
Snake, listen to me.

5636
06:39:23,750 --> 06:39:24,310
No...

5637
06:39:24,310 --> 06:39:26,190
She didn't betray the United States.

5638
06:39:26,610 --> 06:39:27,210
No...

5639
06:39:27,210 --> 06:39:27,690
No.

5640
06:39:28,890 --> 06:39:29,710
Far from it.

5641
06:39:30,310 --> 06:39:32,410
She was a hero who died for her country.

5642
06:39:33,470 --> 06:39:36,590
She carried out her mission knowing full well what was going to happen.

5643
06:39:38,930 --> 06:39:40,130
Self-sacrifice.

5644
06:39:40,130 --> 06:39:42,730
Because that was her duty.

5645
06:39:46,190 --> 06:39:47,630
Oh, it's so gross.

5646
06:39:49,030 --> 06:39:50,650
Oh, it's so awful.

5647
06:39:53,210 --> 06:39:55,370
My whole team, I hate them now too.

5648
06:40:04,920 --> 06:40:07,280
We're gonna get a little secret surprise you guys.

5649
06:40:07,300 --> 06:40:09,960
You are above even the boss.

5650
06:40:10,320 --> 06:40:11,060
No, I'm not.

5651
06:40:11,080 --> 06:40:14,820
I hereby award you the title of Big Boss.

5652
06:40:14,820 --> 06:40:16,760
How did you come up with that one, chief?

5653
06:40:38,070 --> 06:40:39,670
Out of the way, sir!

5654
06:40:49,470 --> 06:40:51,370
Oh my god...

5655
06:40:55,330 --> 06:40:56,070
Okay, time.

5656
06:40:56,170 --> 06:40:56,890
Back to being sad.

5657
06:40:57,090 --> 06:40:57,750
Back to being sad.

5658
06:40:58,370 --> 06:40:59,330
Back to being sad.

5659
06:40:59,970 --> 06:41:04,790
Oh my god, he looks around, he's like paramedic, sigint, major, you all knew!

5660
06:41:05,490 --> 06:41:06,450
You all knew!

5661
06:41:13,760 --> 06:41:14,160
Snubbed.

5662
06:41:16,440 --> 06:41:19,300
Then he held on to that grudge for the rest of his old life.

5663
06:41:25,360 --> 06:41:29,820
Someone like him to handle our top secret sneaking missions for us.

5664
06:41:30,620 --> 06:41:33,200
A man who combines the qualities of a soldier and an agent.

5665
06:41:33,740 --> 06:41:34,080
Shut up!

5666
06:41:34,880 --> 06:41:38,340
The boss's defection was a ruse set up by the US government.

5667
06:41:39,800 --> 06:41:45,020
It was all a big drama staged by Washington so they could get their hands on the philosopher's legacy.

5668
06:41:45,020 --> 06:41:45,120
You knew!

5669
06:41:46,200 --> 06:41:48,800
And the boss was the star of the show.

5670
06:41:48,800 --> 06:41:56,180
They planned it so that they could get the legacy that Colonel Volgin inherited and destroy the Shagohot at the same time.

5671
06:41:57,000 --> 06:42:00,800
Only a legendary hero like the boss could have earned Volgin's trust.

5672
06:42:01,680 --> 06:42:05,520
Finding out where the philosopher's legacy was hidden was to be her greatest mission.

5673
06:42:06,460 --> 06:42:08,260
Everything was going according to plan.

5674
06:42:10,600 --> 06:42:13,380
But then something happened that no one could have predicted.

5675
06:42:15,140 --> 06:42:16,700
Volgin being Volgin.

5676
06:42:16,700 --> 06:42:19,260
A nuclear warhead at Sokolov's research facility.

5677
06:42:21,400 --> 06:42:25,180
Khrushchev demanded that the US government provide proof that it wasn't involved.

5678
06:42:26,020 --> 06:42:28,920
They couldn't just abort the operation to steal the legacy.

5679
06:42:30,360 --> 06:42:34,080
So the operation itself was greatly expanded and revised.

5680
06:42:37,700 --> 06:42:42,880
The authorities in Washington knew that in order to prove its innocence they'd have to get rid of the boss.

5681
06:42:43,780 --> 06:42:46,400
And that one of their own would have to do the job.

5682
06:42:47,760 --> 06:42:50,240
The public couldn't be allowed to find out about it.

5683
06:42:50,800 --> 06:42:51,460
Not ever.

5684
06:42:53,380 --> 06:42:56,900
This, they concluded, would be the best way to keep the whole thing under wraps.

5685
06:42:59,700 --> 06:43:02,180
The boss wouldn't be allowed to come back home alive.

5686
06:43:03,180 --> 06:43:05,240
And she wouldn't be allowed to kill herself.

5687
06:43:06,320 --> 06:43:09,440
Her life would be ended by her most beloved disciple.

5688
06:43:12,880 --> 06:43:14,500
That was the way the government wanted it.

5689
06:43:15,160 --> 06:43:16,900
That was the mission she was given.

5690
06:43:17,480 --> 06:43:19,460
And she had no choice but to carry it out.

5691
06:43:21,020 --> 06:43:24,840
Her death at your hands was a duty she had to fulfill.

5692
06:43:27,000 --> 06:43:29,820
Out of duty she turned her back on her own comrades.

5693
06:43:31,040 --> 06:43:33,940
A lesser woman would have been crushed by such a burden.

5694
06:43:35,940 --> 06:43:39,700
The tainted disgrace will follow her to her grave.

5695
06:43:42,880 --> 06:43:45,000
Future generations will revile her.

5696
06:43:47,710 --> 06:43:50,940
In America as a despicable traitor with no sense of honor.

5697
06:43:52,040 --> 06:43:55,200
And in Russia as a monster who unleashed a nuclear catastrophe.

5698
06:43:57,480 --> 06:44:01,820
She will go down in official history as a war criminal.

5699
06:44:03,680 --> 06:44:05,940
And no one will ever understand her.

5700
06:44:08,760 --> 06:44:11,280
That was her final mission.

5701
06:44:13,880 --> 06:44:16,840
And like a true soldier she saw it through to the end.

5702
06:44:19,740 --> 06:44:24,520
But I think she wanted you, of all people, to know the truth.

5703
06:44:27,980 --> 06:44:32,120
She wanted to live on in your memory.

5704
06:44:35,120 --> 06:44:39,080
Not as a soldier, but as a woman.

5705
06:44:43,400 --> 06:44:46,640
But she was forbidden to tell you herself.

5706
06:44:48,720 --> 06:44:50,740
And that's why she told me.

5707
06:44:56,640 --> 06:45:00,520
Snake, history will never know what she did.

5708
06:45:02,120 --> 06:45:03,960
No one will ever learn the truth.

5709
06:45:05,280 --> 06:45:06,080
Her story.

5710
06:45:07,060 --> 06:45:08,140
Her debriefing.

5711
06:45:09,020 --> 06:45:11,540
Will endure only in your heart.

5712
06:45:18,110 --> 06:45:21,970
Everything she did, she did for her country.

5713
06:45:22,990 --> 06:45:26,390
She sacrificed her life and her honor for her native land.

5714
06:45:28,110 --> 06:45:29,930
She was a real hero.

5715
06:45:32,130 --> 06:45:34,890
She was a true patriot.

5716
06:45:54,280 --> 06:45:55,640
Khrushchev is ousted from power.

5717
06:45:59,180 --> 06:46:01,640
China conducts its first successful nuclear test.

5718
06:46:01,980 --> 06:46:03,700
Sigan joins ARPA.

5719
06:46:05,080 --> 06:46:05,680
U.S.

5720
06:46:05,740 --> 06:46:08,540
government conducts a study on emergency medical treatment.

5721
06:46:08,660 --> 06:46:11,500
The Department of Transportation lays the groundwork for the creation of the EMT system.

5722
06:46:11,640 --> 06:46:13,820
Eva disappears without a trace in Hanoi.

5723
06:46:13,980 --> 06:46:17,280
Paramedic establishes the nation's first paramedic system in Seattle, Washington.

5724
06:46:17,480 --> 06:46:20,460
Major Zero disbands Fox.

5725
06:46:20,460 --> 06:46:22,620
The United States accumulates the remainder of the legacy.

5726
06:46:22,820 --> 06:46:23,080
The U.S.

5727
06:46:23,140 --> 06:46:25,760
branch of the Philosophers changes its name to the Patriots.

5728
06:46:26,140 --> 06:46:28,580
Carrying on the traditions of Major Zero and the Fox Unit, Big Boss establishes...

5729
06:46:29,280 --> 06:46:30,080
Fox out.

5730
06:46:32,540 --> 06:46:34,760
The Les Enfants Terribles Project.

5731
06:46:36,500 --> 06:46:42,280
The sons of Big Boss are born.

5732
06:46:46,510 --> 06:46:50,090
I'm not going to mute it, but I'm going to turn it down just a bit.

5733
06:46:50,210 --> 06:46:51,670
Maybe it won't catch the copyright.

5734
06:46:55,310 --> 06:46:55,690
Uh...

5735
06:46:57,310 --> 06:46:57,690
Uh...

5736
06:47:04,290 --> 06:47:05,050
Uh...

5737
06:47:05,050 --> 06:47:05,590
God,

5738
06:47:16,970 --> 06:47:18,170
this ending just...

5739
06:47:19,930 --> 06:47:22,430
This ending just makes you feel so terrible.

5740
06:47:23,550 --> 06:47:25,630
Robert Atkin Downs was one of the soldiers?

5741
06:47:26,150 --> 06:47:27,050
No way!

5742
06:47:27,860 --> 06:47:28,690
Oh my God!

5743
06:47:28,890 --> 06:47:31,310
Kazuhiro Miller was with us this whole time!

5744
06:47:38,780 --> 06:47:40,550
Oh my God!

5745
06:47:44,350 --> 06:47:45,770
KAIZ was there!

5746
06:47:59,460 --> 06:48:00,280
Man...

5747
06:48:01,120 --> 06:48:03,440
She gave her life for you.

5748
06:48:04,640 --> 06:48:06,280
It's at the end of the game...

5749
06:48:07,360 --> 06:48:12,280
That you realize the Snake Eater lyrics are...

5750
06:48:13,800 --> 06:48:14,440
Really...

5751
06:48:15,360 --> 06:48:16,000
About...

5752
06:48:16,000 --> 06:48:16,840
The boss.

5753
06:48:23,520 --> 06:48:25,780
You are a true major hit, boss.

5754
06:48:27,320 --> 06:48:28,320
Are you okay?

5755
06:48:28,380 --> 06:48:28,880
I'm okay.

5756
06:48:34,160 --> 06:48:34,640
Man...

5757
06:48:35,980 --> 06:48:36,460
Man...

5758
06:48:36,460 --> 06:48:38,620
Such a...

5759
06:48:46,740 --> 06:48:47,940
What a hug.

5760
06:48:47,960 --> 06:48:50,040
Let's have a collective group hug.

5761
06:48:51,480 --> 06:48:53,020
Actually, you guys can do that.

5762
06:48:53,080 --> 06:48:54,320
I'll stand over here and I'll watch.

5763
06:48:57,440 --> 06:48:58,680
Should we do Secret Theater?

5764
06:48:59,600 --> 06:49:01,680
I'll have to change discs, but...

5765
06:49:03,320 --> 06:49:05,820
Let me... I think I'll have to wait until...

5766
06:49:06,940 --> 06:49:08,740
Until it's over, maybe?

5767
06:49:09,840 --> 06:49:12,420
Rika Muranako is a part of this as well?

5768
06:49:12,920 --> 06:49:13,280
Interesting.

5769
06:49:22,660 --> 06:49:23,940
Gosh, oh my gosh.

5770
06:49:23,960 --> 06:49:27,220
We're gonna have to do this all over again when Delta comes out.

5771
06:49:28,680 --> 06:49:30,440
I don't think I'm ready.

5772
06:49:33,340 --> 06:49:35,860
But I'll have my...

5773
06:49:35,860 --> 06:49:36,400
New model.

5774
06:49:39,600 --> 06:49:40,120
So...

5775
06:49:40,120 --> 06:49:41,340
It'll be new and shiny.

5776
06:49:41,520 --> 06:49:43,820
New shiny Minto and new shiny game.

5777
06:49:44,760 --> 06:49:47,020
Congrats on beating MGS3 Subsistence.

5778
06:49:47,400 --> 06:49:51,120
It was great seeing you play on PS2 since so many of us experienced it years ago.

5779
06:49:51,200 --> 06:49:53,560
Here's hoping for some disc 2 action with Secret Theater.

5780
06:49:53,560 --> 06:49:54,900
Duel Vote and Snake vs.

5781
06:49:55,080 --> 06:49:55,720
Monkey sometime.

5782
06:49:56,120 --> 06:49:57,820
We can watch Secret Theater now.

5783
06:49:58,700 --> 06:49:59,420
Once it's over.

5784
06:50:03,540 --> 06:50:05,300
I feel so sad.

5785
06:50:07,860 --> 06:50:08,900
Snake toggle.

5786
06:50:14,630 --> 06:50:15,890
Another important timeline date.

5787
06:50:16,030 --> 06:50:17,370
2024 Mint...

5788
06:50:17,970 --> 06:50:20,410
Co-founds the sons and daughters of the Patreon.

5789
06:50:22,950 --> 06:50:23,550
True.

5790
06:50:30,420 --> 06:50:33,580
Giving Eva the noodles after curing her lets you view her in the...

5791
06:50:34,220 --> 06:50:36,040
Black bikini with sexy poses and cure...

5792
06:50:36,040 --> 06:50:37,780
Oh my god, I really...

5793
06:50:37,780 --> 06:50:38,820
I really...

5794
06:50:40,320 --> 06:50:42,520
I really screwed that one up, huh?

5795
06:50:52,360 --> 06:50:53,400
I feel...

5796
06:50:56,660 --> 06:50:59,280
Oh my gosh, I met so many of these voice actors.

5797
06:51:01,800 --> 06:51:02,800
Rowdy Reiko.

5798
06:51:07,880 --> 06:51:09,320
Is that Monkey?

5799
06:51:10,020 --> 06:51:10,500
Snake vs.

5800
06:51:10,660 --> 06:51:10,840
Monkey?

5801
06:51:16,100 --> 06:51:21,620
I feel though a lot of the same things in this game will be in Delta.

5802
06:51:25,280 --> 06:51:25,840
So...

5803
06:51:26,500 --> 06:51:29,100
Ape Escape 3 for Solid Ape Minigame soon.

5804
06:51:32,560 --> 06:51:34,060
You met some of the voice actors?

5805
06:51:34,300 --> 06:51:34,620
Yeah.

5806
06:51:39,340 --> 06:51:44,540
We don't get this theme anymore, but it still makes me...

5807
06:51:47,720 --> 06:51:49,220
Yeah, Chris Zimmerman!

5808
06:51:51,500 --> 06:51:53,760
Thank you for the playthrough, boss.

5809
06:51:54,200 --> 06:51:58,560
If I remember correctly, the DCI's office is on one of the upper floors of the agency building.

5810
06:51:58,620 --> 06:52:02,920
So Ocelot somehow climbed up way up to some tiny ledge just to shoot a snake.

5811
06:52:03,020 --> 06:52:03,980
No, he's pretty good.

5812
06:52:06,680 --> 06:52:08,680
Oh, Ocelot.

5813
06:52:09,580 --> 06:52:11,540
Oh, Ocelot, you...

5814
06:52:18,000 --> 06:52:20,000
This guy...

5815
06:52:20,540 --> 06:52:23,540
is the most...

5816
06:52:25,760 --> 06:52:28,760
This version of the song though makes me...

5817
06:52:29,080 --> 06:52:30,240
Like the guitar version.

5818
06:52:40,140 --> 06:52:41,140
Freaks a lot.

5819
06:52:42,080 --> 06:52:43,940
That guy is just... Oh, there's Rumble Roses.

5820
06:52:47,160 --> 06:52:48,500
Otacon is a...

5821
06:52:51,880 --> 06:52:53,000
Why is...

5822
06:52:53,000 --> 06:52:54,960
Why did they bring up Otacon here?

5823
06:52:56,820 --> 06:52:57,940
Cynthia O'Rourke!

5824
06:53:00,700 --> 06:53:05,060
Wait, I didn't realize Rika Muranaka did both songs.

5825
06:53:09,000 --> 06:53:12,420
No, no, no...

5826
06:53:14,640 --> 06:53:18,140
The guitar part reminds me of Snake Beam from MGS4.

5827
06:53:18,260 --> 06:53:18,880
Me too!

5828
06:53:20,320 --> 06:53:21,360
Me too.

5829
06:53:23,420 --> 06:53:27,300
We still have one last thing after the credits.

5830
06:53:28,360 --> 06:53:31,900
Then I'll switch out the CDs for...

5831
06:53:34,920 --> 06:53:35,580
For...

5832
06:53:36,060 --> 06:53:36,820
Oh my gosh!

5833
06:53:36,860 --> 06:53:38,660
Wait, I should have changed camos.

5834
06:53:38,740 --> 06:53:43,900
I got the snake camo from the boss, but I never got to see it.

5835
06:53:54,480 --> 06:53:55,360
Yes sir!

5836
06:53:57,420 --> 06:53:58,300
No sir!

5837
06:53:59,420 --> 06:54:00,300
Yes sir!

5838
06:54:00,300 --> 06:54:02,460
The CIA is taking care of the boss themselves.

5839
06:54:05,440 --> 06:54:05,940
Ocelot.

5840
06:54:06,140 --> 06:54:07,940
I believe the White House will be satisfied.

5841
06:54:10,620 --> 06:54:11,580
Khrushchev is finished.

5842
06:54:12,440 --> 06:54:14,140
Your time has finally arrived.

5843
06:54:14,780 --> 06:54:15,420
Your time?

5844
06:54:18,460 --> 06:54:22,880
Yes, the American president is relying on us to keep a lid on the whole affair.

5845
06:54:23,680 --> 06:54:24,840
We've got him by the balls.

5846
06:54:25,720 --> 06:54:28,500
It should make a valuable trump card in future negotiations.

5847
06:54:32,300 --> 06:54:34,120
Yes, Chief Director, of course.

5848
06:54:34,760 --> 06:54:35,980
I'll keep the KGB informed.

5849
06:54:39,740 --> 06:54:40,080
Balls.

5850
06:54:42,580 --> 06:54:43,860
He's calling someone else?

5851
06:54:47,360 --> 06:54:48,420
He's calling someone.

5852
06:54:48,700 --> 06:54:49,680
Who else is he calling?

5853
06:54:51,800 --> 06:54:52,160
Yeah?

5854
06:54:53,800 --> 06:54:54,640
Moshi moshi?

5855
06:54:54,840 --> 06:54:55,540
Yes, it's me.

5856
06:54:57,100 --> 06:54:57,620
Ocelot!

5857
06:54:57,700 --> 06:54:58,040
Oh my gosh!

5858
06:54:58,180 --> 06:54:59,000
It's been forever!

5859
06:54:59,000 --> 06:54:59,600
How are you?

5860
06:54:59,660 --> 06:55:01,060
The boss has accomplished her mission.

5861
06:55:01,060 --> 06:55:03,060
I thought he was calling me.

5862
06:55:04,220 --> 06:55:06,600
The philosopher's legacy is now safely with us.

5863
06:55:06,680 --> 06:55:07,940
In America's hands.

5864
06:55:08,160 --> 06:55:08,720
Us?

5865
06:55:09,920 --> 06:55:11,300
Ocelot, you are Russian?

5866
06:55:12,000 --> 06:55:15,680
With this money, yes, the philosophers can finally be revived.

5867
06:55:18,780 --> 06:55:19,800
You are us.

5868
06:55:20,120 --> 06:55:22,240
The film we handed the Chinese was a fake.

5869
06:55:24,060 --> 06:55:26,040
Peking must be in an uproar right about now.

5870
06:55:29,240 --> 06:55:29,800
Eva...

5871
06:55:29,800 --> 06:55:30,900
I'm afraid so.

5872
06:55:31,360 --> 06:55:33,760
Only half the money has made it back to the United States.

5873
06:55:36,640 --> 06:55:38,880
The KGB must still have part of the legacy.

5874
06:55:42,280 --> 06:55:44,580
Yes, the weapon has been reduced to ashes.

5875
06:55:44,980 --> 06:55:47,440
The weapon...Shagohad.

5876
06:55:48,120 --> 06:55:48,860
That's right.

5877
06:55:50,140 --> 06:55:53,320
Groznygrad has been obliterated by the Davy Crockett we brought in as well.

5878
06:55:53,520 --> 06:55:54,560
Oh my god!

5879
06:55:56,660 --> 06:55:58,600
Yes, that was the boss' work too.

5880
06:56:01,920 --> 06:56:06,300
Speaking of which, I've obtained something from Granon that you might find interesting.

5881
06:56:06,840 --> 06:56:09,640
It's a revolutionary new nuclear attack system.

5882
06:56:10,300 --> 06:56:12,260
Perhaps it might just come in handy someday.

5883
06:56:15,900 --> 06:56:18,920
Yes, we have John...I mean Snake to thank for that.

5884
06:56:20,040 --> 06:56:21,280
Khrushchev believed it as well.

5885
06:56:24,660 --> 06:56:26,000
Yes, they bought our story.

5886
06:56:27,040 --> 06:56:28,480
I don't think they'll be making a fuss.

5887
06:56:29,200 --> 06:56:31,400
I can play as the first in there.

5888
06:56:31,880 --> 06:56:35,720
You know he's probably...he's probably like looked in the mirror.

5889
06:56:42,000 --> 06:56:43,500
Triple crossing them!

5890
06:56:43,780 --> 06:56:44,340
Triple!

5891
06:56:59,130 --> 06:57:05,320
Of course, I'm always at the CIA's disposal...Mr.

5892
06:57:05,460 --> 06:57:05,780
Director.

5893
06:57:05,900 --> 06:57:07,220
Mr. Director!

5894
06:57:11,060 --> 06:57:12,520
Snake Eater!

5895
06:57:20,180 --> 06:57:21,000
Jaguar?

5896
06:57:22,540 --> 06:57:23,600
What's a Jaguar?

5897
06:57:24,040 --> 06:57:25,580
Godombo does it again!

5898
06:57:29,200 --> 06:57:30,620
Adamska was Adam.

5899
06:57:30,760 --> 06:57:31,160
Yes!

5900
06:57:31,260 --> 06:57:31,920
Oh my gosh!

5901
06:57:32,020 --> 06:57:33,740
We did figure that out.

5902
06:57:37,280 --> 06:57:38,500
It's so obvious.

5903
06:57:38,740 --> 06:57:40,760
He's been speaking English the entire time.

5904
06:57:42,820 --> 06:57:43,820
Thanks for the feed Kuri!

5905
06:57:43,880 --> 06:57:47,100
Yesterday my heart was beating so fast, my smartphone registered as exercise.

5906
06:57:47,560 --> 06:57:47,920
Stop!

5907
06:57:48,100 --> 06:57:48,620
No way!

5908
06:57:49,880 --> 06:57:51,580
I'm glad we could meet, David!

5909
06:57:52,140 --> 06:57:53,140
Thank you.

5910
06:57:53,780 --> 06:57:55,500
Also Valkyrie, thank you so much earlier.

5911
06:57:55,700 --> 06:57:57,540
You're still my oshi, Maid Eater.

5912
06:57:58,980 --> 06:58:00,300
What's this special item?

5913
06:58:00,440 --> 06:58:02,220
Maybe you get it after a new game plus?

5914
06:58:06,020 --> 06:58:07,620
73 kills!

5915
06:58:07,960 --> 06:58:08,520
No!

5916
06:58:08,980 --> 06:58:09,300
What?

5917
06:58:09,740 --> 06:58:10,060
No!

5918
06:58:10,520 --> 06:58:14,800
My river was clean you guys!

5919
06:58:15,040 --> 06:58:17,460
How did we go from 10 to 73?

5920
06:58:20,140 --> 06:58:24,220
When we left Garazinigrad...

5921
06:58:26,140 --> 06:58:28,480
It says human killed.

5922
06:58:30,000 --> 06:58:31,960
Not the fish killed.

5923
06:58:35,680 --> 06:58:36,560
Motorcycle sand.

5924
06:58:40,660 --> 06:58:41,540
Thank you!

5925
06:58:42,200 --> 06:58:42,860
Oh my gosh!

5926
06:58:42,860 --> 06:58:43,820
Thank you so much for the haka!

5927
06:58:45,020 --> 06:58:48,000
Thanks for playing and sharing the experience with us, Mito!

5928
06:58:48,340 --> 06:58:50,100
It was my first time and it was an amazing ride.

5929
06:58:50,180 --> 06:58:50,960
What a great game!

5930
06:58:51,020 --> 06:58:52,520
I feel kind of empty now though.

5931
06:58:52,600 --> 06:58:53,060
I know.

5932
06:58:53,540 --> 06:58:56,900
The characters and story were so good and Snake went through so much betrayal.

5933
06:58:56,900 --> 06:58:58,280
Everybody.

5934
06:58:59,120 --> 06:59:00,880
Literally everybody.

5935
06:59:02,840 --> 06:59:06,640
And that's just the whole story in all of Metal Gear.

5936
06:59:07,260 --> 06:59:10,600
Everyone is just taking advantage of Snake.

5937
06:59:10,860 --> 06:59:12,180
No matter what Snake!

5938
06:59:14,600 --> 06:59:16,200
It's so...

5939
06:59:17,220 --> 06:59:19,600
So frustrating for him.

5940
06:59:20,040 --> 06:59:23,400
He's a good guy, you know?

5941
06:59:23,840 --> 06:59:25,420
It just makes me so sad.

5942
06:59:26,540 --> 06:59:27,500
Thanks for the playthrough.

5943
06:59:27,660 --> 06:59:35,540
I hope that if you're there when Matara is playing, you can tell her not to re-chat after the boss fight so nobody tells her to pull the trigger manually.

5944
06:59:36,380 --> 06:59:38,140
Sorry for the anti-vaccinating vaccine.

5945
06:59:39,940 --> 06:59:41,340
Yeah, thank you!

5946
06:59:42,180 --> 06:59:43,420
I do...

5947
06:59:44,260 --> 06:59:47,420
Maybe want to be there for Matara's...

5948
06:59:48,880 --> 06:59:49,320
Playthrough.

5949
06:59:50,400 --> 06:59:50,840
Maybe.

5950
06:59:51,360 --> 06:59:52,880
Thank you so much for the ping!

5951
06:59:52,880 --> 06:59:57,900
Not only did you first try a bunch of bosses, you got a bunch of difficult non-lethal boss finishes.

5952
06:59:58,360 --> 07:00:00,480
You're pretty good and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise!

5953
07:00:01,140 --> 07:00:02,100
Thank you!

5954
07:00:03,600 --> 07:00:04,440
Thank you.

5955
07:00:04,940 --> 07:00:05,660
Let it through!

5956
07:00:07,940 --> 07:00:10,620
You are above even the boss.

5957
07:00:10,760 --> 07:00:13,560
I hereby award you the title of Freak Boss.

5958
07:00:15,980 --> 07:00:17,960
Everybody always exploits the himbo.

5959
07:00:18,060 --> 07:00:18,620
It's true.

5960
07:00:18,960 --> 07:00:20,920
Wait, but what does Jaguar mean for real?

5961
07:00:20,980 --> 07:00:21,720
I'm so curious.

5962
07:00:25,080 --> 07:00:25,600
Oh...

5963
07:00:26,940 --> 07:00:30,160
Usually I get like elephant, so I'm just like...

5964
07:00:30,160 --> 07:00:33,980
Don't spoil anything, but does Adam know who his parents are?

5965
07:00:35,380 --> 07:00:35,900
I...

5966
07:00:37,200 --> 07:00:39,400
Don't actually know if that was ever like explicit.

5967
07:00:39,520 --> 07:00:40,880
I don't actually remember if that's explicitly...

5968
07:00:42,620 --> 07:00:43,140
Mentioned.

5969
07:00:43,520 --> 07:00:47,760
I know it's implied who his parents are in Codec in this game.

5970
07:00:49,580 --> 07:00:51,640
But that's from other people.

5971
07:00:51,800 --> 07:00:55,180
It's not implied from him himself, so...

5972
07:00:55,180 --> 07:00:55,540
You know?

5973
07:00:59,560 --> 07:01:01,400
I thought it was a QR code for a second.

5974
07:01:02,580 --> 07:01:03,960
It does look like that, right?

5975
07:01:03,960 --> 07:01:04,960
Okay...

5976
07:01:09,120 --> 07:01:12,640
Jaguar get from 1 to 100 kills.

5977
07:01:12,800 --> 07:01:15,380
Get from 21 to 50 alerts.

5978
07:01:15,860 --> 07:01:18,380
Use from 0 to 40 continues.

5979
07:01:19,000 --> 07:01:22,020
I only had 11 continues you guys.

5980
07:01:22,060 --> 07:01:24,060
That's actually insane for me.

5981
07:01:24,540 --> 07:01:25,060
Wow!

5982
07:01:25,660 --> 07:01:26,500
Wow!

5983
07:01:26,620 --> 07:01:27,940
Oh my gosh!

5984
07:01:29,260 --> 07:01:30,040
Wow!

5985
07:01:30,040 --> 07:01:33,420
Thank you once again for another Metal Gear stream!

5986
07:01:33,540 --> 07:01:36,220
With every stream comes with new laughs and heartfelt moments.

5987
07:01:36,300 --> 07:01:37,220
You're pretty good!

5988
07:01:37,300 --> 07:01:38,420
You're pretty good!

5989
07:01:38,800 --> 07:01:40,100
Terisa welcome to membership!

5990
07:01:40,320 --> 07:01:40,960
Thank you!

5991
07:01:41,860 --> 07:01:42,360
Wow!

5992
07:01:42,640 --> 07:01:43,780
Oh my gosh!

5993
07:01:44,740 --> 07:01:45,980
I'm so happy!

5994
07:01:50,940 --> 07:01:51,480
Wow...

5995
07:01:52,620 --> 07:01:54,340
What's next in the line up boss?

5996
07:01:54,560 --> 07:01:59,120
I think I might go into...

5997
07:01:59,120 --> 07:02:03,340
I might do some of the games I have never played before first, like...

5998
07:02:03,340 --> 07:02:08,120
Ghost Babble, Snake's Revenge, Metal Gear Solid Acid...

5999
07:02:10,880 --> 07:02:12,360
And then we'll go into 4.

6000
07:02:14,800 --> 07:02:18,220
And then... I don't know if I'm gonna play Portable Ops again.

6001
07:02:18,680 --> 07:02:19,660
I'll be honest.

6002
07:02:20,360 --> 07:02:22,940
I didn't really enjoy it before.

6003
07:02:24,960 --> 07:02:31,520
I think they both knew considering the way they acted around each other and Adam was the CIA contact for the boss originally.

6004
07:02:31,920 --> 07:02:33,140
I guess that would make sense.

6005
07:02:34,340 --> 07:02:35,320
Really fun stream.

6006
07:02:35,380 --> 07:02:36,860
You've been a shining beacon this week.

6007
07:02:37,620 --> 07:02:38,860
Thank you Taylor!

6008
07:02:39,060 --> 07:02:40,220
I really appreciate it!

6009
07:02:40,800 --> 07:02:41,740
There's a leech rank.

6010
07:02:41,760 --> 07:02:43,940
If you finish the game with a leech attack it's Snake.

6011
07:02:44,060 --> 07:02:44,500
No way!

6012
07:02:46,580 --> 07:02:55,620
If you ever think about how Ocelot snaps his bullet necklace before Snake jumps into the river, but in the last showdown it's on his necklace again implying that he got a new necklace to put the bullet on.

6013
07:02:55,820 --> 07:03:02,380
I mean, he got a necklace to begin with to put the bullet on, so the guy is already just a freak!

6014
07:03:02,820 --> 07:03:04,480
That bullet is for Snake!

6015
07:03:07,160 --> 07:03:07,700
God...

6016
07:03:08,240 --> 07:03:09,080
OK.

6017
07:03:09,940 --> 07:03:13,100
Let me go to the title.

6018
07:03:13,300 --> 07:03:14,900
New item obtained!

6019
07:03:16,120 --> 07:03:17,360
The Patriot.

6020
07:03:28,300 --> 07:03:29,380
Brown face paint.

6021
07:03:30,680 --> 07:03:32,520
National flag face paint.

6022
07:03:36,280 --> 07:03:39,840
I forgot you get the tuxedo.

6023
07:03:41,240 --> 07:03:48,340
I usually only drink my coffee cold with milk, but I bought that one cup hot and dark.

6024
07:03:48,560 --> 07:03:50,400
I quite like it now.

6025
07:03:51,480 --> 07:03:52,780
Thank you for the Godot cosplay.

6026
07:03:52,900 --> 07:03:53,600
It was so awesome.

6027
07:03:55,160 --> 07:03:57,080
Askem desert camo.

6028
07:03:58,380 --> 07:03:59,820
Desert tiger camo.

6029
07:04:01,060 --> 07:04:02,420
Flecktarn camo.

6030
07:04:03,340 --> 07:04:05,580
So many camos.

6031
07:04:06,440 --> 07:04:07,980
Thank you for the pink!

6032
07:04:08,780 --> 07:04:09,380
Thank you Donald.

6033
07:04:09,740 --> 07:04:10,660
Thank you so much for the streaming.

6034
07:04:10,820 --> 07:04:12,880
It's so fun seeing you freaking out over this game.

6035
07:04:13,360 --> 07:04:15,940
I can never not freak out over this game.

6036
07:04:16,200 --> 07:04:20,680
I can never not freak out over this game.

6037
07:04:22,520 --> 07:04:29,400
On my desk I have a little snake standy made by Raspberry Maddy.

6038
07:04:29,840 --> 07:04:35,060
I have my tiny big boss and then I have a revolver ocelot pen from Fangamer.

6039
07:04:35,060 --> 07:04:39,160
On my desk is all MGS3 stuff.

6040
07:04:40,720 --> 07:04:47,060
Even though it's like tied with MGS2 as my favorite, but...

6041
07:04:47,780 --> 07:04:54,860
As someone who can barely handle combat and noted clicking simulator old school runescape, I think you're pretty alright against gaming pink boss.

6042
07:04:55,680 --> 07:04:56,580
Thank you Avril!

6043
07:04:57,140 --> 07:05:00,060
You know it doesn't matter if you're good or not as long as you enjoy it.

6044
07:05:00,060 --> 07:05:00,800
Alright.

6045
07:05:01,560 --> 07:05:05,060
And that's the thing about Metal Gear is I don't feel like I have to be so so good.

6046
07:05:05,660 --> 07:05:09,500
I just love experiencing the story.

6047
07:05:10,940 --> 07:05:16,460
Like to me I never feel like, even though I love this series so much, I never feel like I need to become a pro at it.

6048
07:05:16,960 --> 07:05:17,960
Because I love it.

6049
07:05:18,020 --> 07:05:21,460
Like I feel like I'm so satisfied just kind of...

6050
07:05:21,460 --> 07:05:27,160
Especially because if I don't play it for a while and then play it again I feel like it's a new experience.

6051
07:05:27,160 --> 07:05:33,760
So it makes me even more excited than if I were to like learn how to speedrun through it or something, you know?

6052
07:05:35,400 --> 07:05:35,700
I

6053
07:05:47,060 --> 07:05:47,540
got it.

6054
07:05:47,660 --> 07:05:50,320
I gotta get the second disc.

6055
07:05:51,280 --> 07:05:53,320
Disc 2, Persistence.

6056
07:06:21,780 --> 07:06:22,260
Wait,

6057
07:06:25,860 --> 07:06:27,140
where did I put the case?

6058
07:06:27,380 --> 07:06:27,940
Oh, there.

6059
07:06:30,480 --> 07:06:31,200
There we go.

6060
07:06:32,760 --> 07:06:34,000
Oh, the nostalgia.

6061
07:06:34,280 --> 07:06:35,020
I know, right?

6062
07:06:39,380 --> 07:06:43,180
So now the secret theater should be unlocked because I beat the game, so...

6063
07:06:43,980 --> 07:06:45,320
Sound gave me a flashback.

6064
07:06:45,880 --> 07:06:48,020
Welcome to your nostalgia trip.

6065
07:06:55,740 --> 07:06:58,520
Sorry this super isn't related to the game, but when is the Minto plushie coming?

6066
07:06:58,760 --> 07:07:01,020
Last update about it was in August and I want to buy one.

6067
07:07:01,500 --> 07:07:02,760
Luke, thank you!

6068
07:07:03,580 --> 07:07:05,140
I'm glad that you are interested.

6069
07:07:05,660 --> 07:07:06,040
Oh my god.

6070
07:07:09,540 --> 07:07:13,220
As for when it's coming, it's still in production.

6071
07:07:14,340 --> 07:07:19,080
So I can't say exactly a specific date.

6072
07:07:21,220 --> 07:07:23,480
I hope soon because...

6073
07:07:24,160 --> 07:07:26,060
For basically... Oh my god, Metal Gear Online.

6074
07:07:27,220 --> 07:07:30,120
For like all of my merchandise.

6075
07:07:31,100 --> 07:07:32,400
Almost all of it.

6076
07:07:33,000 --> 07:07:36,200
I've kind of like prepaid for the amounts, you know?

6077
07:07:37,480 --> 07:07:38,860
So I'm like...

6078
07:07:38,860 --> 07:07:39,960
I'm like...

6079
07:07:39,960 --> 07:07:44,900
Man, I really hope I can put this out soon so I can make some money.

6080
07:07:45,200 --> 07:07:47,520
Hopefully get my money back.

6081
07:07:51,600 --> 07:07:52,260
Since...

6082
07:07:53,280 --> 07:07:55,860
Since a lot of it is...

6083
07:07:55,860 --> 07:07:58,660
Just is predetermined amounts.

6084
07:08:01,700 --> 07:08:02,360
So...

6085
07:08:03,940 --> 07:08:05,360
Hopefully I can...

6086
07:08:06,640 --> 07:08:07,760
Put them out soon.

6087
07:08:08,640 --> 07:08:11,300
One of them, the little Lego blocks, those are ready.

6088
07:08:11,780 --> 07:08:16,880
So those will be shipped soon to the warehouse that I'm gonna be using.

6089
07:08:22,700 --> 07:08:23,220
But...

6090
07:08:25,220 --> 07:08:27,120
Time to buy, buy, buy.

6091
07:08:27,520 --> 07:08:32,040
I'm gonna do my best to keep things as low price as possible.

6092
07:08:32,040 --> 07:08:35,860
For merchandise, I don't really care so much about making a profit.

6093
07:08:36,220 --> 07:08:38,340
I would much rather...

6094
07:08:38,340 --> 07:08:40,040
People be able to...

6095
07:08:40,740 --> 07:08:41,520
You know.

6096
07:08:41,760 --> 07:08:42,240
Oh my god.

6097
07:08:43,120 --> 07:08:48,460
People be able to get some fun merch, so...

6098
07:08:52,040 --> 07:08:52,380
Woah!

6099
07:08:53,840 --> 07:08:54,440
Woah!

6100
07:08:54,680 --> 07:08:54,900
Woah!

6101
07:08:55,820 --> 07:08:58,080
These locations are...

6102
07:09:03,000 --> 07:09:04,600
This is the best trailer ever.

6103
07:09:12,020 --> 07:09:14,600
Those boxes there are not suspicious.

6104
07:09:15,580 --> 07:09:17,500
All these people running around in their boxes.

6105
07:09:19,620 --> 07:09:22,900
I never got to play Metal Gear Online.

6106
07:09:23,960 --> 07:09:26,040
I would love to though.

6107
07:09:27,040 --> 07:09:28,980
I never got to play it though.

6108
07:09:29,240 --> 07:09:30,460
So sad.

6109
07:09:34,400 --> 07:09:38,600
What will you be pricing the bathwater at?

6110
07:09:41,360 --> 07:09:42,080
Subsist.

6111
07:09:45,900 --> 07:09:47,340
Well, you know...

6112
07:09:47,340 --> 07:09:49,500
I would like you to take the bath.

6113
07:09:51,660 --> 07:09:52,040
So...

6114
07:09:57,500 --> 07:10:00,400
Sorry, I know I could click out of this, but it's so fun watching.

6115
07:10:03,560 --> 07:10:05,540
Open sales at a PST-friendly time?

6116
07:10:05,580 --> 07:10:06,900
Because I know all the merch is still out.

6117
07:10:06,940 --> 07:10:09,420
I don't... I really don't think so.

6118
07:10:12,820 --> 07:10:14,120
Sorry, Rycom is so funny.

6119
07:10:16,480 --> 07:10:17,000
What?

6120
07:10:17,260 --> 07:10:17,460
What?

6121
07:10:17,680 --> 07:10:17,840
What?

6122
07:10:25,860 --> 07:10:28,020
This trailer is so awesome.

6123
07:10:33,140 --> 07:10:35,100
I don't think it will sell out.

6124
07:10:37,620 --> 07:10:40,500
Like, I have a good amount of stuff, you guys.

6125
07:10:40,800 --> 07:10:43,940
Like, I bought a pretty good amount of it, so...

6126
07:10:47,900 --> 07:10:48,420
No!

6127
07:10:48,920 --> 07:10:51,140
Why is he... Oh, the magazine.

6128
07:10:51,440 --> 07:10:52,680
Oh, they are all looking at it.

6129
07:10:57,500 --> 07:10:59,140
Is this... Is this Peace Walker?

6130
07:11:01,300 --> 07:11:02,500
Oh my god, it's the training.

6131
07:11:02,980 --> 07:11:03,700
On the beach.

6132
07:11:04,800 --> 07:11:05,860
Is he saluting them?

6133
07:11:05,980 --> 07:11:06,500
So cute.

6134
07:11:11,060 --> 07:11:12,760
Oh my god, get stick bugged!

6135
07:11:20,420 --> 07:11:22,100
This is so pink.

6136
07:11:22,120 --> 07:11:22,960
I can't.

6137
07:11:24,600 --> 07:11:29,280
Please, god, bring back Metal Gear Online in Delta!

6138
07:11:29,560 --> 07:11:30,720
Please, god!

6139
07:11:30,900 --> 07:11:31,580
Please, god!

6140
07:11:31,780 --> 07:11:35,860
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please!

6141
07:11:49,540 --> 07:11:52,000
Please do Metal Gear Online in MGS5.

6142
07:11:53,560 --> 07:11:55,280
There are so many emotes to do.

6143
07:11:58,380 --> 07:11:58,920
Ghostbusters?

6144
07:11:58,920 --> 07:11:59,500
Ghostbusters?

6145
07:12:03,080 --> 07:12:03,520
Ghostbusters?

6146
07:12:03,580 --> 07:12:04,560
Why do you have that?

6147
07:12:04,720 --> 07:12:05,640
The Ghostbusters.

6148
07:12:12,360 --> 07:12:13,960
That was a flamethrower.

6149
07:12:14,200 --> 07:12:16,260
No, I think that was a ghost vacuum.

6150
07:12:17,320 --> 07:12:18,340
Bust him, bust him.

6151
07:12:21,340 --> 07:12:25,360
But, like I said, I got a good amount of stuff, so...

6152
07:12:26,160 --> 07:12:29,020
I don't think it will sell out, like, immediately.

6153
07:12:29,260 --> 07:12:30,420
I think you guys will be okay.

6154
07:12:33,760 --> 07:12:37,200
Oh my gosh, please, Metal Gear Online, please!

6155
07:12:37,800 --> 07:12:40,060
Please come back with Delta!

6156
07:12:40,980 --> 07:12:41,400
Please!

6157
07:12:42,680 --> 07:12:49,600
As for your question about playing on the V, Metal Gear Online V...

6158
07:12:49,600 --> 07:12:55,300
I don't know, because it's not exactly the same.

6159
07:12:58,480 --> 07:13:02,600
It's like when you go to other people's mother base and you kind of like...

6160
07:13:03,560 --> 07:13:04,900
Fuck shit up, right?

6161
07:13:08,240 --> 07:13:09,360
It's not...

6162
07:13:09,360 --> 07:13:10,600
It's not...

6163
07:13:12,840 --> 07:13:14,060
Kind of how it is.

6164
07:13:14,760 --> 07:13:17,080
But I want the true interactivity.

6165
07:13:19,600 --> 07:13:21,020
Oh, there's more than that, really?

6166
07:13:22,580 --> 07:13:23,460
Has actual MP.

6167
07:13:25,180 --> 07:13:27,300
There was an online competitive mode?

6168
07:13:27,380 --> 07:13:29,700
Is there still an online competitive mode?

6169
07:13:30,840 --> 07:13:33,320
It's traditional MGO stuff, not FOB infiltrates.

6170
07:13:33,380 --> 07:13:33,840
Oh, really?

6171
07:13:36,120 --> 07:13:37,160
FOB, FOB.

6172
07:13:40,180 --> 07:13:41,300
Should still be up.

6173
07:13:44,100 --> 07:13:44,880
Should we?

6174
07:13:45,580 --> 07:13:47,140
Would you guys want to play with me?

6175
07:13:48,380 --> 07:13:50,140
Would you guys want to play with me?

6176
07:13:53,220 --> 07:13:54,340
FOB, FOB.

6177
07:13:54,560 --> 07:13:55,120
Yeah?

6178
07:13:59,340 --> 07:14:03,100
I love being able to play with you guys in Peace Walker.

6179
07:14:03,480 --> 07:14:04,560
I want that.

6180
07:14:04,840 --> 07:14:09,300
I want us to be able to play Peace Walker together when we get to it.

6181
07:14:09,380 --> 07:14:15,260
I think I might honestly do the whole game with people instead of just the boss fights.

6182
07:14:15,260 --> 07:14:20,700
Because I've done the game before, so it might help us get through it a little bit quickly.

6183
07:14:25,280 --> 07:14:29,180
PC or PS4 for MGSV?

6184
07:14:30,780 --> 07:14:32,380
Maybe I'll do PC this time.

6185
07:14:33,240 --> 07:14:35,680
I want to be able to get some mods and stuff.

6186
07:14:36,320 --> 07:14:38,760
And be able to customize my music and everything.

6187
07:14:39,920 --> 07:14:42,700
I didn't get to do that since I played on the PS4 before.

6188
07:14:45,440 --> 07:14:46,400
So...OK!

6189
07:14:46,860 --> 07:14:47,880
Secret Theater!

6190
07:14:49,120 --> 07:14:50,860
Secret Theater!

6191
07:14:51,440 --> 07:14:52,140
Secret Theater!

6192
07:14:52,800 --> 07:15:02,480
I never got to do this myself because before I watched just the cutscenes, but look!

6193
07:15:04,080 --> 07:15:07,200
The beginning is the end.

6194
07:15:09,780 --> 07:15:11,360
Wait, what is...

6195
07:15:12,600 --> 07:15:13,620
OK, I see, I see.

6196
07:15:14,020 --> 07:15:14,860
Let's go!

6197
07:15:15,660 --> 07:15:16,440
From here.

6198
07:15:16,860 --> 07:15:18,600
I think we go from here...

6199
07:15:18,600 --> 07:15:21,360
Then here...then here...

6200
07:15:21,360 --> 07:15:21,700
Maybe?

6201
07:15:22,180 --> 07:15:23,320
Are you still...wait.

6202
07:15:23,740 --> 07:15:24,540
Maybe it doesn't matter.

6203
07:15:24,840 --> 07:15:25,540
Yeah, maybe?

6204
07:15:25,820 --> 07:15:26,260
I don't know.

6205
07:15:26,400 --> 07:15:27,420
OK, let's do it!

6206
07:15:28,840 --> 07:15:30,180
Made in the USA!

6207
07:15:38,290 --> 07:15:39,350
She's so crunchy.

6208
07:15:44,850 --> 07:15:46,030
This guy.

6209
07:15:53,670 --> 07:15:55,830
Are there any R1's in this?

6210
07:16:02,110 --> 07:16:02,830
Actually...

6211
07:16:02,830 --> 07:16:02,830
No?

6212
07:16:04,470 --> 07:16:04,890
OK, nevermind.

6213
07:16:05,010 --> 07:16:05,750
Thank you.

6214
07:16:08,730 --> 07:16:10,770
I can sit back and relax so much.

6215
07:16:12,830 --> 07:16:15,190
Let me type something here.

6216
07:16:26,470 --> 07:16:28,910
Oh my God!

6217
07:16:39,110 --> 07:16:42,190
OK, we beat the game!

6218
07:16:42,370 --> 07:16:43,550
Watching Secret Theater now.

6219
07:16:47,690 --> 07:16:48,290
Basashi.

6220
07:16:52,640 --> 07:16:55,140
I think Delta will have the Secret Theater.

6221
07:16:55,240 --> 07:16:55,880
I hope so.

6222
07:16:56,900 --> 07:17:02,660
They really seem to be making a faithful recreation.

6223
07:17:06,720 --> 07:17:09,480
But it's hard to say since the HD collection didn't have it, you know?

6224
07:17:17,780 --> 07:17:18,380
Horse.

6225
07:17:20,260 --> 07:17:20,860
Pira.

6226
07:17:23,080 --> 07:17:24,240
What the...

6227
07:17:24,240 --> 07:17:28,000
Who will gulp like that?

6228
07:17:34,730 --> 07:17:38,230
I can't eat the horse.

6229
07:17:39,270 --> 07:17:39,990
Paramedic!

6230
07:17:48,270 --> 07:17:49,150
Snake.

6231
07:17:49,150 --> 07:17:51,810
Stop right there.

6232
07:17:53,130 --> 07:17:55,410
Oh my God, maybe Snake will love Sushi.

6233
07:17:57,050 --> 07:17:57,550
Oh my God.

6234
07:17:58,150 --> 07:17:59,350
Don't make her mad.

6235
07:18:05,090 --> 07:18:07,530
What is this fever dream?

6236
07:18:12,550 --> 07:18:13,270
Cowabunga!

6237
07:18:19,150 --> 07:18:20,330
Yeah, yeah.

6238
07:18:28,170 --> 07:18:28,990
Oh,

6239
07:18:40,530 --> 07:18:42,510
that's why it's called Basashi.

6240
07:18:44,210 --> 07:18:45,670
Close call.

6241
07:18:47,670 --> 07:18:49,390
These are actually funny.

6242
07:18:49,450 --> 07:18:50,170
Yeah, they are!

6243
07:18:50,290 --> 07:18:51,850
They're so goofy.

6244
07:18:52,490 --> 07:18:54,910
These are actually so goofy.

6245
07:18:57,770 --> 07:18:58,370
I

6246
07:19:02,520 --> 07:19:05,380
only remember a few of them pretty well, so...

6247
07:19:05,380 --> 07:19:05,980
What was that?

6248
07:19:07,480 --> 07:19:08,440
Oh, Snake!

6249
07:19:10,140 --> 07:19:11,880
It took off his clothes!

6250
07:19:23,300 --> 07:19:25,640
That was a close call.

6251
07:19:28,960 --> 07:19:32,700
I like how you can even do everything in here.

6252
07:19:33,160 --> 07:19:33,840
So funny.

6253
07:19:34,140 --> 07:19:34,380
What?

6254
07:19:39,500 --> 07:19:41,640
These titles are so good.

6255
07:19:43,120 --> 07:19:44,140
There we go.

6256
07:19:46,020 --> 07:19:46,600
Oh no.

6257
07:19:47,540 --> 07:19:48,940
Should we save Raiden for last?

6258
07:20:01,810 --> 07:20:02,450
Tatiana.

6259
07:20:06,310 --> 07:20:07,110
Yeah, OK.

6260
07:20:07,530 --> 07:20:08,370
We'll save him for last.

6261
07:20:18,110 --> 07:20:22,190
I have to thank you for waking me.

6262
07:20:24,270 --> 07:20:26,350
Oh God, Grandpa!

6263
07:20:34,330 --> 07:20:35,130
Grandpa!

6264
07:20:44,230 --> 07:20:46,310
Oh my God, he is just there.

6265
07:20:47,090 --> 07:20:48,430
Oh my God.

6266
07:20:53,660 --> 07:20:54,460
Where is he?

6267
07:20:54,960 --> 07:20:55,860
Where is Waldo?

6268
07:21:00,500 --> 07:21:02,720
Oh my God!

6269
07:21:04,760 --> 07:21:06,920
He is just like me for real.

6270
07:21:15,530 --> 07:21:17,970
Don't touch him.

6271
07:21:19,970 --> 07:21:20,490
Hmm...

6272
07:21:26,080 --> 07:21:27,520
Oh my God.

6273
07:21:27,780 --> 07:21:29,360
It's basically point blank.

6274
07:21:31,560 --> 07:21:34,020
This is Minto if she was still alive and aged to an old granny.

6275
07:21:35,040 --> 07:21:35,460
Yeah.

6276
07:21:37,800 --> 07:21:38,320
Twice.

6277
07:21:49,660 --> 07:21:51,200
Please guard the sound.

6278
07:21:51,280 --> 07:21:51,740
It's so loud.

6279
07:21:52,600 --> 07:21:53,760
He's gonna see them kiss!

6280
07:21:59,800 --> 07:22:00,440
Oh!

6281
07:22:04,080 --> 07:22:09,360
That's it?

6282
07:22:10,000 --> 07:22:10,780
This far?

6283
07:22:15,300 --> 07:22:16,740
The end is better.

6284
07:22:20,680 --> 07:22:23,580
Oh my God!

6285
07:22:35,780 --> 07:22:37,440
Oh no, she looks too cool.

6286
07:22:37,620 --> 07:22:38,860
Can't kill her.

6287
07:22:45,080 --> 07:22:45,660
Grandpa!

6288
07:22:47,100 --> 07:22:48,060
Oh my God.

6289
07:23:05,660 --> 07:23:07,260
Does it keep going?

6290
07:23:07,560 --> 07:23:08,180
Oh, OK.

6291
07:23:09,480 --> 07:23:10,960
He still got it.

6292
07:23:10,960 --> 07:23:13,400
Yeah, we'll...Snake Erasure.

6293
07:23:13,840 --> 07:23:14,740
Eraser, sorry.

6294
07:23:14,920 --> 07:23:16,280
We'll save these two.

6295
07:23:16,360 --> 07:23:17,880
The MGS4 trailer also.

6296
07:23:18,360 --> 07:23:20,680
No, I'm gonna be...No!

6297
07:23:22,100 --> 07:23:23,880
The quick version.

6298
07:23:24,580 --> 07:23:26,000
I want the really quick version.

6299
07:23:30,600 --> 07:23:32,860
I think I remember how the trailer is.

6300
07:23:33,500 --> 07:23:33,980
Ocelot.

6301
07:23:50,780 --> 07:23:52,460
It's like kind of like...Oh my God.

6302
07:24:08,190 --> 07:24:10,030
I don't get to do this anymore.

6303
07:24:10,230 --> 07:24:13,370
It's like at the end of a movie when they had like the...

6304
07:24:13,370 --> 07:24:18,110
Like a cartoon movie when they had the cartoon characters do bloopers and stuff.

6305
07:24:19,390 --> 07:24:20,190
The joy.

6306
07:24:20,190 --> 07:24:20,290
OK.

6307
07:24:23,210 --> 07:24:24,310
DMC5 has some good ones?

6308
07:24:26,090 --> 07:24:26,570
Stop!

6309
07:24:27,310 --> 07:24:31,870
Yeah, like at the end of...Pixar, Pixar, Pixar, yeah.

6310
07:24:33,850 --> 07:24:35,650
That was genuinely funny.

6311
07:24:38,750 --> 07:24:39,710
The joy.

6312
07:25:00,450 --> 07:25:02,070
Is this the Rock, Paper, Scissors?

6313
07:25:06,630 --> 07:25:09,350
The new series has this, but it's not an after game thing.

6314
07:25:09,450 --> 07:25:10,690
It's joke endings you can get.

6315
07:25:11,190 --> 07:25:21,250
Oh my God.

6316
07:25:21,690 --> 07:25:22,330
They shouldn't be bothered.

6317
07:25:23,210 --> 07:25:23,470
Boss?

6318
07:25:25,610 --> 07:25:26,130
What?

6319
07:25:28,490 --> 07:25:29,650
Oh my God!

6320
07:25:39,040 --> 07:25:40,480
She explodes.

6321
07:25:41,200 --> 07:25:43,860
All of the cover unit explodes.

6322
07:25:47,720 --> 07:25:49,580
I read them for the articles.

6323
07:25:52,000 --> 07:25:55,420
This one is going to be a little sassy, isn't it?

6324
07:25:55,980 --> 07:25:56,700
Sokolove.

6325
07:25:59,500 --> 07:26:02,080
Sokolove you naughty naughty boy you.

6326
07:26:04,340 --> 07:26:05,420
What is this?

6327
07:26:06,520 --> 07:26:07,120
What is this?

6328
07:26:07,600 --> 07:26:09,440
That's me reading my doujins.

6329
07:26:09,920 --> 07:26:10,660
What is this?

6330
07:26:13,240 --> 07:26:14,700
Oh my God.

6331
07:26:15,580 --> 07:26:16,620
He's not even burning them.

6332
07:26:16,740 --> 07:26:18,180
He's stowing them away for later.

6333
07:26:18,900 --> 07:26:19,940
He's stashing them.

6334
07:26:20,400 --> 07:26:21,120
What is this?

6335
07:26:22,700 --> 07:26:23,720
He must be James.

6336
07:26:32,430 --> 07:26:33,830
He respects it.

6337
07:26:39,710 --> 07:26:40,270
Yeah.

6338
07:26:42,410 --> 07:26:42,970
Wow.

6339
07:26:46,450 --> 07:26:47,450
Those reflexes.

6340
07:26:48,050 --> 07:26:49,670
Snake is so cool when he's not mean.

6341
07:26:50,650 --> 07:26:52,490
When he's not controlled by me.

6342
07:26:53,330 --> 07:26:53,890
Snake?

6343
07:26:56,650 --> 07:26:59,650
You're not being a snake beater over here, are you?

6344
07:27:01,730 --> 07:27:02,850
His eyes!

6345
07:27:02,990 --> 07:27:04,250
Why are they so anime?

6346
07:27:21,040 --> 07:27:23,600
He should have shared.

6347
07:27:32,500 --> 07:27:33,560
Wow.

6348
07:27:34,860 --> 07:27:36,080
He did share.

6349
07:27:36,340 --> 07:27:38,080
Metal Gear...

6350
07:27:44,060 --> 07:27:45,620
Circle jerk.

6351
07:27:45,940 --> 07:27:46,240
No!

6352
07:27:47,720 --> 07:27:51,240
True bromance is sharing a magazine together.

6353
07:27:53,180 --> 07:27:57,640
If I find good stuff, I share with my friends.

6354
07:28:00,300 --> 07:28:02,000
That is the truth.

6355
07:28:07,860 --> 07:28:10,680
Mr. Siget!

6356
07:28:14,380 --> 07:28:16,160
He's just here!

6357
07:28:28,300 --> 07:28:29,220
Oh my God.

6358
07:28:29,280 --> 07:28:30,980
I almost spat on my drink.

6359
07:28:31,360 --> 07:28:32,400
When he did the smile.

6360
07:28:32,700 --> 07:28:36,660
You know what he looked like when he did the smile.

6361
07:28:37,320 --> 07:28:38,820
He looked like...

6362
07:28:38,820 --> 07:28:40,480
He looked like Sam!

6363
07:28:42,940 --> 07:28:43,980
From Rising!

6364
07:28:47,060 --> 07:28:48,160
Yeah, the Sam smile.

6365
07:28:50,960 --> 07:28:51,980
No, it should have been me.

6366
07:28:52,180 --> 07:28:52,920
Not him!

6367
07:28:52,920 --> 07:28:53,840
It was me!

6368
07:29:05,670 --> 07:29:06,150
Oh

6369
07:29:10,490 --> 07:29:11,210
no, Snake!

6370
07:29:12,170 --> 07:29:12,550
Oh no!

6371
07:29:19,260 --> 07:29:20,820
Oh my God, Siget is so cool.

6372
07:29:22,800 --> 07:29:23,760
The dogs!

6373
07:29:33,990 --> 07:29:35,690
Why doesn't he have a shirt on?

6374
07:29:35,690 --> 07:29:35,990
No!

6375
07:29:42,930 --> 07:29:45,810
Oh my God, Ocelot is not even looking at him.

6376
07:29:45,830 --> 07:29:47,990
Oh my God, this is me...

6377
07:29:47,990 --> 07:29:50,390
Wait, this is actually me playing as Snake.

6378
07:29:55,640 --> 07:29:59,480
This is how Metal Gear is when I play as Snake.

6379
07:30:05,840 --> 07:30:07,680
Oh my God, it's too real.

6380
07:30:11,820 --> 07:30:13,360
Game Snake vs.

6381
07:30:13,540 --> 07:30:14,780
Cutscene Snake.

6382
07:30:15,960 --> 07:30:16,340
No!

6383
07:30:21,040 --> 07:30:23,640
Oh my God, it's the same exact.

6384
07:30:27,200 --> 07:30:28,660
Wait, no way.

6385
07:30:30,120 --> 07:30:31,960
Oh, he's quivering little lips.

6386
07:30:32,720 --> 07:30:33,660
Snake, no!

6387
07:30:44,360 --> 07:30:45,780
This is cool, oh my God!

6388
07:30:47,900 --> 07:30:49,860
Self-insert fanfiction.

6389
07:31:20,750 --> 07:31:23,410
Is he the tiger rug?

6390
07:31:24,370 --> 07:31:25,730
Don't tell me.

6391
07:31:26,750 --> 07:31:27,530
Oh my God.

6392
07:31:28,150 --> 07:31:28,830
I'm scared.

6393
07:31:29,070 --> 07:31:29,690
Ok, good.

6394
07:31:32,050 --> 07:31:33,530
His hair!

6395
07:31:35,270 --> 07:31:35,570
Snake!

6396
07:31:45,270 --> 07:31:46,910
What is this?

6397
07:31:54,820 --> 07:31:56,770
Give Snake a shirt!

6398
07:31:57,370 --> 07:31:57,790
Somebody!

6399
07:32:00,630 --> 07:32:02,210
Metal Gear Signature.

6400
07:32:04,790 --> 07:32:06,090
These are too much.

6401
07:32:07,050 --> 07:32:08,790
These are too much.

6402
07:32:08,870 --> 07:32:09,570
They are so funny.

6403
07:32:14,310 --> 07:32:15,590
Die hard.

6404
07:32:21,550 --> 07:32:23,610
I'm a big fan of Metal Gear Saga.

6405
07:32:46,180 --> 07:32:47,220
I wish.

6406
07:32:48,220 --> 07:32:48,780
What

6407
07:32:54,750 --> 07:32:55,650
is this animation?

6408
07:33:22,120 --> 07:33:23,860
This is peak anime.

6409
07:33:24,160 --> 07:33:25,080
It really is.

6410
07:33:26,900 --> 07:33:28,380
Give what up already?

6411
07:33:29,460 --> 07:33:32,300
I was thinking Team Rocket is passing over me.

6412
07:33:34,360 --> 07:33:36,300
The ultimate weapon.

6413
07:33:40,840 --> 07:33:42,240
Wait.

6414
07:33:42,660 --> 07:33:43,720
Scissors.

6415
07:33:46,280 --> 07:33:48,620
Nothing beats scissors!

6416
07:34:15,330 --> 07:34:16,030
What

6417
07:34:29,880 --> 07:34:31,580
is this?

6418
07:34:36,860 --> 07:34:40,280
My sleep paralysis demon making me choose.

6419
07:34:48,000 --> 07:34:49,720
What do you choose?

6420
07:34:52,960 --> 07:34:55,180
He looks like an idol.

6421
07:35:17,550 --> 07:35:18,870
Come out, Jack.

6422
07:35:20,350 --> 07:35:21,590
It's over.

6423
07:35:25,010 --> 07:35:25,650
Snake!

6424
07:35:30,550 --> 07:35:33,730
I don't think that was over the top at all.

6425
07:35:34,710 --> 07:35:35,530
Snake cheated.

6426
07:35:37,190 --> 07:35:38,010
He cheated.

6427
07:35:39,010 --> 07:35:40,450
Alright, we got a couple more.

6428
07:35:41,030 --> 07:35:42,670
And then we'll do these two.

6429
07:35:47,330 --> 07:35:49,870
These are so funny.

6430
07:36:03,950 --> 07:36:11,950
Okay, let's play Metal Gear Solid 3 one more time!

6431
07:36:14,630 --> 07:36:16,370
My bag!

6432
07:36:33,500 --> 07:36:34,680
Colonel!

6433
07:36:40,340 --> 07:36:43,160
The beginning is the end.

6434
07:36:43,160 --> 07:36:45,600
Gotcha this time.

6435
07:36:46,060 --> 07:36:46,880
Get down.

6436
07:36:47,480 --> 07:36:48,180
Payback.

6437
07:36:50,770 --> 07:36:52,200
Cat like behavior.

6438
07:36:54,160 --> 07:36:55,640
Let's do gotcha this time.

6439
07:36:56,180 --> 07:36:57,020
Nice speedrun.

6440
07:36:57,100 --> 07:36:57,720
Thank you!

6441
07:37:19,200 --> 07:37:20,860
This one is so short.

6442
07:37:22,900 --> 07:37:23,680
This one.

6443
07:37:23,860 --> 07:37:25,180
This one is really...

6444
07:37:25,180 --> 07:37:27,280
This one is really peaking my curiosity.

6445
07:37:27,480 --> 07:37:28,300
I must be patient.

6446
07:37:28,440 --> 07:37:29,260
I must be patient.

6447
07:37:30,160 --> 07:37:31,840
I still remember all of these.

6448
07:37:31,880 --> 07:37:32,700
They are so good.

6449
07:37:33,040 --> 07:37:35,040
I can't wait for the one with the...

6450
07:37:35,040 --> 07:37:35,260
This!

6451
07:37:35,420 --> 07:37:35,560
This!

6452
07:37:35,680 --> 07:37:35,860
This!

6453
07:37:40,160 --> 07:37:41,740
The guys from the end.

6454
07:37:46,620 --> 07:37:47,740
Oh my god!

6455
07:38:08,690 --> 07:38:09,330
Okay, wait.

6456
07:38:09,390 --> 07:38:10,310
Maybe it's not this one.

6457
07:38:11,250 --> 07:38:13,310
The one where the guy gets snubbed.

6458
07:38:15,570 --> 07:38:17,370
It's this one because it's payback.

6459
07:38:17,470 --> 07:38:18,490
Wait, this one is so funny.

6460
07:38:18,810 --> 07:38:20,830
Why were they all suck a lot?

6461
07:38:21,050 --> 07:38:23,310
What does get down have to do with it?

6462
07:38:29,150 --> 07:38:32,850
Why were they all suck a lot?

6463
07:38:33,230 --> 07:38:34,130
Okay, this one is good.

6464
07:38:35,550 --> 07:38:37,110
This is the one I remember the most.

6465
07:38:37,170 --> 07:38:37,690
It's so good.

6466
07:38:37,770 --> 07:38:38,250
It's so funny.

6467
07:38:38,510 --> 07:38:39,930
This is me playing!

6468
07:38:42,760 --> 07:38:44,560
The handshake, yeah.

6469
07:38:45,260 --> 07:38:46,900
Because he snubbed him in the end.

6470
07:38:48,760 --> 07:38:50,040
So funny.

6471
07:39:00,480 --> 07:39:02,780
Director of the CIA.

6472
07:39:04,800 --> 07:39:06,680
What are you doing here?

6473
07:39:08,540 --> 07:39:09,380
Wait!

6474
07:39:11,260 --> 07:39:15,660
I forgot that he...I didn't even remember him saying that.

6475
07:39:15,660 --> 07:39:16,900
So funny.

6476
07:39:18,620 --> 07:39:20,300
This one is so good though.

6477
07:39:22,220 --> 07:39:25,080
It's payback for not shaking his hand!

6478
07:39:26,320 --> 07:39:28,120
Look how mad he is.

6479
07:39:28,260 --> 07:39:29,680
He's like seething.

6480
07:39:36,600 --> 07:39:38,000
Oh my god!

6481
07:39:38,260 --> 07:39:39,220
CQC Pro!

6482
07:39:50,870 --> 07:39:52,910
He's like, take my hand!

6483
07:40:39,530 --> 07:40:44,690
What's so funny about this is just how actually absurd they are.

6484
07:40:45,490 --> 07:40:48,130
Some of these make actual no sense.

6485
07:40:48,490 --> 07:40:55,450
It's like, what if the guy who didn't get the handshake at the end wanted revenge?

6486
07:40:55,570 --> 07:40:58,270
And then, once he got the handshake, they kissed!

6487
07:41:01,790 --> 07:41:02,910
Kojimbo does it again.

6488
07:41:03,110 --> 07:41:04,990
Whose idea was the kiss, I wonder?

6489
07:41:07,470 --> 07:41:10,030
Little YouTube poops, I don't know.

6490
07:41:12,430 --> 07:41:13,670
Whose idea was the kiss?

6491
07:41:19,570 --> 07:41:20,690
I know!

6492
07:41:21,290 --> 07:41:22,950
You were like the first person I saw.

6493
07:41:30,790 --> 07:41:31,970
You're all good.

6494
07:41:32,070 --> 07:41:32,650
Thank you!

6495
07:41:34,970 --> 07:41:36,770
Thanks for coming to save me!

6496
07:41:37,430 --> 07:41:38,450
Thanks for the Haka Soup.

6497
07:41:38,570 --> 07:41:39,690
I really appreciate it.

6498
07:41:41,590 --> 07:41:42,230
Thank you, thank you.

6499
07:41:43,390 --> 07:41:45,110
Alright, let's find it and then we have two more.

6500
07:41:49,610 --> 07:41:55,610
Also, thank you for letting the other person borrow your other glasses, BiriBiri.

6501
07:41:56,170 --> 07:41:57,390
They told me.

6502
07:42:03,690 --> 07:42:05,090
I'll give you that.

6503
07:42:12,570 --> 07:42:19,470
It's not...this isn't a speech you would think would target my core like this.

6504
07:42:20,090 --> 07:42:20,990
Oh my God.

6505
07:42:24,170 --> 07:42:25,010
Oh, but it does.

6506
07:42:33,610 --> 07:42:34,230
Oh!

6507
07:42:45,540 --> 07:42:46,160
Bitch!

6508
07:42:46,300 --> 07:42:46,720
Bitch!

6509
07:42:48,460 --> 07:42:50,220
Gotta get that fourth one in.

6510
07:43:06,020 --> 07:43:08,020
Alright, let's watch this one.

6511
07:43:08,080 --> 07:43:09,360
Metal Gear Raiden.

6512
07:43:10,420 --> 07:43:11,840
And then we'll watch the trailer.

6513
07:43:14,840 --> 07:43:16,080
This is so funny.

6514
07:43:20,540 --> 07:43:21,460
Oh!

6515
07:43:30,580 --> 07:43:31,500
Rosemary.

6516
07:43:40,080 --> 07:43:43,680
Oh my God, look how smug he is.

6517
07:43:46,520 --> 07:43:47,680
I love this.

6518
07:43:47,800 --> 07:43:48,520
This is so funny.

6519
07:44:03,760 --> 07:44:04,900
Terminator reference.

6520
07:44:19,800 --> 07:44:22,420
Oh my God, look at him.

6521
07:44:22,440 --> 07:44:23,080
He looks so good.

6522
07:44:43,110 --> 07:44:43,810
The

6523
07:44:48,540 --> 07:44:49,240
necklace.

6524
07:44:57,690 --> 07:44:59,100
Did I kiss?

6525
07:45:01,420 --> 07:45:05,540
This game...this series is just...

6526
07:45:12,760 --> 07:45:15,440
Oh my God.

6527
07:45:16,280 --> 07:45:18,860
This series is too...just...

6528
07:45:20,140 --> 07:45:25,940
We've had more men kissing than...than anything else.

6529
07:45:27,080 --> 07:45:32,720
We saw Raiden kiss Ocelot before we saw him kiss Rose.

6530
07:45:39,940 --> 07:45:42,180
Oh Ivan.

6531
07:45:54,180 --> 07:45:55,860
His face.

6532
07:45:58,460 --> 07:45:58,740
Oh.

6533
07:46:01,980 --> 07:46:03,380
Stop.

6534
07:46:12,980 --> 07:46:20,620
Oh my God.

6535
07:46:22,660 --> 07:46:23,580
I can't.

6536
07:46:23,760 --> 07:46:23,860
Oh.

6537
07:46:26,480 --> 07:46:27,760
Raiden.

6538
07:46:30,920 --> 07:46:31,560
Raiden!

6539
07:46:34,080 --> 07:46:35,240
Oh my God.

6540
07:46:36,600 --> 07:46:38,540
This is so goofy.

6541
07:46:39,080 --> 07:46:44,060
The music is too much.

6542
07:46:54,700 --> 07:46:55,200
Brandon!

6543
07:47:14,510 --> 07:47:15,670
How mysterious.

6544
07:47:17,530 --> 07:47:19,250
What is happening?

6545
07:47:26,430 --> 07:47:28,170
There's two of them.

6546
07:47:29,050 --> 07:47:31,630
Oh my God, there's two of them.

6547
07:47:34,410 --> 07:47:35,130
Hello.

6548
07:47:36,430 --> 07:47:37,150
Ivan!

6549
07:47:38,290 --> 07:47:40,270
I was you with Matara.

6550
07:47:40,430 --> 07:47:41,510
What are you talking about?

6551
07:47:44,260 --> 07:47:44,980
Paradox.

6552
07:47:48,060 --> 07:47:50,000
Why does Raiden sound so weird?

6553
07:47:50,260 --> 07:47:51,260
Who's voicing him?

6554
07:48:15,130 --> 07:48:16,870
His NBA is Rycarl.

6555
07:48:18,750 --> 07:48:19,510
Interesting.

6556
07:48:21,210 --> 07:48:30,090
I guess it wouldn't be...it would be kind of weird to bring in Raiden's VA just for a secret theater.

6557
07:48:35,250 --> 07:48:36,490
Oh my God.

6558
07:48:37,010 --> 07:48:37,610
So loud.

6559
07:48:44,000 --> 07:48:45,340
He's so cool.

6560
07:48:45,480 --> 07:48:46,400
Don't you see Raiden?

6561
07:48:47,600 --> 07:48:50,040
This is why he's the main character.

6562
07:48:53,640 --> 07:48:54,120
You alright?

6563
07:49:00,530 --> 07:49:01,250
Sorry.

6564
07:49:08,210 --> 07:49:11,090
Gotta be careful out there Raiden.

6565
07:49:13,890 --> 07:49:14,970
Don't do it.

6566
07:49:16,570 --> 07:49:17,750
Don't do it.

6567
07:49:17,950 --> 07:49:18,770
Don't do it Raiden.

6568
07:49:19,810 --> 07:49:20,530
No!

6569
07:49:22,010 --> 07:49:22,990
Let's go.

6570
07:49:28,490 --> 07:49:31,550
They went heavy on the eyeliner with him, didn't they?

6571
07:49:38,190 --> 07:49:47,690
Oh my God, I can't believe Raiden is dead!

6572
07:49:47,690 --> 07:49:47,790
Raiden!

6573
07:49:50,330 --> 07:49:52,690
Oh my God, even here.

6574
07:49:54,590 --> 07:49:55,910
Is he out the window?

6575
07:49:56,330 --> 07:49:57,350
Is he the one peeking in?

6576
07:50:01,330 --> 07:50:06,790
Imagine him in like a Spongebob style full body cast.

6577
07:50:06,790 --> 07:50:07,130
Stop!

6578
07:50:16,610 --> 07:50:19,950
Why would you do that Raiden?

6579
07:50:21,630 --> 07:50:23,630
You get your own game.

6580
07:50:27,390 --> 07:50:29,350
That's why he becomes a cyborg.

6581
07:50:29,490 --> 07:50:30,590
Oh my God!

6582
07:50:31,070 --> 07:50:31,610
No!

6583
07:50:32,630 --> 07:50:34,350
Oh my God!

6584
07:50:34,890 --> 07:50:36,170
No way!

6585
07:50:41,010 --> 07:50:42,150
Stop it!

6586
07:50:43,090 --> 07:50:44,250
Oh my God!

6587
07:50:49,720 --> 07:50:51,480
Oh my gosh!

6588
07:50:54,120 --> 07:50:56,280
Oh my gosh, Big Boss!

6589
07:50:57,820 --> 07:51:02,880
Wait, this is Metal Gear 2 so this would be actual Big Boss.

6590
07:51:03,260 --> 07:51:04,420
Technically I guess.

6591
07:51:06,980 --> 07:51:08,100
Don't interfere!

6592
07:51:08,580 --> 07:51:09,380
He is mine!

6593
07:51:11,920 --> 07:51:14,120
I knew I should have killed you!

6594
07:51:22,920 --> 07:51:25,480
That's just the cut out of his head.

6595
07:51:27,560 --> 07:51:28,900
It's too funny.

6596
07:51:31,940 --> 07:51:34,620
There is going to be a 5, right?

6597
07:51:37,360 --> 07:51:39,440
Oh, about that...

6598
07:51:50,440 --> 07:51:51,400
About that...

6599
07:51:51,900 --> 07:51:52,380
Ripperoni.

6600
07:51:52,940 --> 07:51:56,340
Alright, now let's watch the trailer for MGS4.

6601
07:51:57,060 --> 07:52:00,200
Which I'm pretty sure this is all silly stuff too, but...

6602
07:52:03,480 --> 07:52:04,520
These are so goofy.

6603
07:52:04,640 --> 07:52:08,620
I'm so tired now though, so after this I'm going to call it quits.

6604
07:52:10,760 --> 07:52:11,500
Sleepy, sleepy.

6605
07:52:12,680 --> 07:52:13,980
No 5, only B.

6606
07:52:13,980 --> 07:52:14,560
Yeah.

6607
07:52:16,220 --> 07:52:18,140
He got his revengeance.

6608
07:52:26,700 --> 07:52:28,180
Kojima Productions!

6609
07:52:29,300 --> 07:52:32,140
Don't worry, Riot and Big Boss didn't start 5 either.

6610
07:52:33,680 --> 07:52:34,940
It hurts.

6611
07:52:47,510 --> 07:52:48,550
Oh my gosh.

6612
07:52:48,870 --> 07:52:51,910
I can't imagine being at E3 and this starting.

6613
07:52:53,410 --> 07:52:56,210
I would have just...I would have...

6614
07:52:56,210 --> 07:52:58,030
No place to hide!

6615
07:52:59,390 --> 07:53:03,390
No place for...

6616
07:53:06,570 --> 07:53:07,890
Stop.

6617
07:53:13,680 --> 07:53:17,020
Kojima Productions presents...

6618
07:53:25,900 --> 07:53:27,680
Snake, you gotta get the chair!

6619
07:53:28,440 --> 07:53:29,040
Snake!

6620
07:53:29,920 --> 07:53:33,060
You gotta get the...main character!

6621
07:53:33,060 --> 07:53:33,060
Bing!

6622
07:53:35,360 --> 07:53:35,780
Bing!

6623
07:53:46,300 --> 07:53:48,460
Don't you dare.

6624
07:53:56,660 --> 07:54:02,430
No place for Hideo.

6625
07:54:04,850 --> 07:54:06,550
No hideout.

6626
07:54:24,650 --> 07:54:26,370
One chair left.

6627
07:54:28,670 --> 07:54:34,030
I love how this is a trailer for 4 and MGS4 is like one of the most...

6628
07:54:34,630 --> 07:54:36,450
totally sad games.

6629
07:54:37,890 --> 07:54:40,830
You feel so...

6630
07:54:41,830 --> 07:54:45,750
You feel so...no replacement for Hideo.

6631
07:54:51,280 --> 07:54:52,660
Is it riding?

6632
07:55:09,050 --> 07:55:11,350
I guess we should have watched this one before, huh?

6633
07:55:11,770 --> 07:55:12,330
The other one.

6634
07:55:12,510 --> 07:55:12,950
But that's ok.

6635
07:55:14,050 --> 07:55:16,330
But yeah, like you see this and you're just like...

6636
07:55:16,330 --> 07:55:16,450
Haha!

6637
07:55:17,070 --> 07:55:18,390
This is so silly!

6638
07:55:18,530 --> 07:55:19,510
Oh my god, no.

6639
07:55:26,300 --> 07:55:26,700
Sam.

6640
07:55:28,660 --> 07:55:29,380
Splinter Cell.

6641
07:55:29,720 --> 07:55:30,760
Sam Splinter Cell.

6642
07:55:37,100 --> 07:55:38,760
And then...it's just...

6643
07:55:41,000 --> 07:55:43,500
The fourth game is just way so depressing.

6644
07:55:43,780 --> 07:55:45,580
Oh my god, they're so cute.

6645
07:55:50,320 --> 07:55:52,180
That's me in the audience by the way.

6646
07:55:56,690 --> 07:56:01,390
I take that credit for every single one of those people in the audience.

6647
07:56:19,600 --> 07:56:21,000
Seats?

6648
07:56:26,980 --> 07:56:28,380
MGS4!

6649
07:56:34,840 --> 07:56:36,760
That explained...

6650
07:56:38,560 --> 07:56:41,580
Literally nothing about MGS4.

6651
07:56:44,740 --> 07:56:46,360
That literally...

6652
07:56:49,240 --> 07:56:51,420
For PlayStation 3.

6653
07:56:52,060 --> 07:56:53,180
Explained everything.

6654
07:56:54,200 --> 07:56:56,280
They show ridings in it, yeah.

6655
07:56:59,480 --> 07:57:00,280
Thank you.

6656
07:57:06,820 --> 07:57:11,600
PlayStation...I cannot believe the trailer for Metal Gear Solid 4 was in 2005!

6657
07:57:14,080 --> 07:57:15,220
Oh my god.

6658
07:57:15,780 --> 07:57:18,180
I mean, it wasn't the game came out with...

6659
07:57:18,840 --> 07:57:19,920
3 years later?

6660
07:57:19,920 --> 07:57:19,980
3 years later?

6661
07:57:29,520 --> 07:57:30,580
Oh, 7.

6662
07:57:32,720 --> 07:57:33,960
3 or 2 years?

6663
07:57:34,300 --> 07:57:35,120
Was it 2008?

6664
07:57:35,540 --> 07:57:35,720
Right?

6665
07:57:35,860 --> 07:57:36,200
I thought.

6666
07:57:37,580 --> 07:57:38,880
Some people are saying 2007.

6667
07:57:42,460 --> 07:57:43,520
But wow.

6668
07:57:44,820 --> 07:57:49,040
Even I'd say Metal Gear Solid 4's graphics really, really hold up.

6669
07:57:50,260 --> 07:57:53,300
The whole Metal Gear series...

6670
07:57:53,300 --> 07:57:54,840
I mean, I guess...

6671
07:57:54,840 --> 07:57:58,140
If you want to argue MGS1, but...

6672
07:57:58,140 --> 07:58:00,800
The whole Metal Gear series really holds up...

6673
07:58:01,260 --> 07:58:01,660
Graphically.

6674
07:58:02,540 --> 07:58:04,020
It just all looks so good.

6675
07:58:04,380 --> 07:58:05,280
Thanks, Splinter Cell Toss.

6676
07:58:05,380 --> 07:58:07,240
A couple of references to Metal Gear Solid.

6677
07:58:07,340 --> 07:58:11,540
If you interrogate guards, they go like, You can't shake me and have ammo fall from me.

6678
07:58:11,660 --> 07:58:12,460
That's so cute!

6679
07:58:19,140 --> 07:58:21,320
IMO, MGS1 holds up the best out of all of them?

6680
07:58:21,420 --> 07:58:21,800
Really?

6681
07:58:21,940 --> 07:58:22,480
I think so.

6682
07:58:23,480 --> 07:58:23,980
It does.

6683
07:58:24,100 --> 07:58:26,600
I mean, for the time, it looks great.

6684
07:58:27,900 --> 07:58:30,000
But, you know...

6685
07:58:30,000 --> 07:58:34,720
Like, I could suggest Metal Gear Solid 2 to someone...

6686
07:58:35,360 --> 07:58:38,100
And they could be like, Wow, this looks really good.

6687
07:58:38,240 --> 07:58:41,740
If someone is like, I hate old games.

6688
07:58:42,300 --> 07:58:43,140
I hate how they look.

6689
07:58:43,240 --> 07:58:45,220
You know, if someone were to say that...

6690
07:58:45,220 --> 07:58:50,160
It's really hard to say that Metal Gear Solid 2 looks quote-unquote old.

6691
07:58:50,340 --> 07:58:50,900
You know what I mean?

6692
07:58:52,100 --> 07:58:53,460
It's actually so...

6693
07:58:55,160 --> 07:58:56,440
I get...

6694
07:58:56,440 --> 07:58:57,360
Only...

6695
07:58:57,360 --> 07:58:59,700
Only I feel kind of recently...

6696
07:58:59,700 --> 07:59:01,020
I never used to feel this way.

6697
07:59:01,080 --> 07:59:03,160
But only very recently...

6698
07:59:03,160 --> 07:59:06,440
I mean, probably within the past two weeks...

6699
07:59:06,440 --> 07:59:08,460
Did I start feeling...

6700
07:59:10,320 --> 07:59:10,960
So...

6701
07:59:10,960 --> 07:59:12,340
I guess sad?

6702
07:59:12,720 --> 07:59:17,300
About how we'll never have such a golden age of video games again.

6703
07:59:17,360 --> 07:59:22,520
Like, in terms of technological leaps.

6704
07:59:23,820 --> 07:59:25,840
Like, only really so recently...

6705
07:59:25,840 --> 07:59:27,460
I was just like, oh...

6706
07:59:29,720 --> 07:59:30,940
You know, like...

6707
07:59:30,940 --> 07:59:33,940
Going from Metal Gear Solid 1...

6708
07:59:33,940 --> 07:59:36,360
On the PlayStation to Metal Gear Solid 2...

6709
07:59:36,360 --> 07:59:38,600
And the PlayStation 2 was like...

6710
07:59:38,600 --> 07:59:41,800
You know, I even still remember when I...

6711
07:59:41,800 --> 07:59:43,460
Like, watched the cutscenes...

6712
07:59:44,120 --> 07:59:44,680
Not the cut...

6713
07:59:44,680 --> 07:59:46,140
Like, you know, the...

6714
07:59:46,140 --> 07:59:48,800
Not the in-game rendered ones...

6715
07:59:48,800 --> 07:59:51,200
But like, the super nice ones in Kingdom Hearts...

6716
07:59:51,200 --> 07:59:53,200
And I was just like, this is...

6717
07:59:53,860 --> 07:59:57,220
This is the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life!

6718
07:59:57,480 --> 07:59:57,760
You know?

6719
07:59:57,980 --> 07:59:58,940
I was like, wow!

6720
08:00:00,000 --> 08:00:02,640
Like, just watching those...

6721
08:00:02,640 --> 08:00:04,180
And how...

6722
08:00:04,800 --> 08:00:05,300
How...

6723
08:00:05,300 --> 08:00:06,420
You know...

6724
08:00:07,050 --> 08:00:09,020
I was able to see...

6725
08:00:09,020 --> 08:00:10,660
The progression...

6726
08:00:10,660 --> 08:00:11,760
So cool.

6727
08:00:12,980 --> 08:00:16,600
If you ever get sad about thinking that you're old...

6728
08:00:17,180 --> 08:00:20,200
Just know that at least you got to kind of experience...

6729
08:00:20,820 --> 08:00:21,480
That era.

6730
08:00:21,480 --> 08:00:22,280
You know?

6731
08:00:22,680 --> 08:00:24,520
And it's something that is very unique.

6732
08:00:30,360 --> 08:00:32,060
VR still has a ways to go at least.

6733
08:00:32,140 --> 08:00:32,640
That's true!

6734
08:00:32,780 --> 08:00:33,320
That's true.

6735
08:00:34,240 --> 08:00:35,160
Very, very true.

6736
08:00:36,640 --> 08:00:39,760
Imagine jumping from Sega Genesis to 3D models on the PS1.

6737
08:00:40,180 --> 08:00:41,500
That was young me, I know!

6738
08:00:42,700 --> 08:00:44,300
Just wondering, did you ever...

6739
08:00:44,300 --> 08:00:46,620
Play the Cyberwolf DLC in Metal Gear Revengeance?

6740
08:00:48,780 --> 08:00:50,440
Not the Cyberwolf, no.

6741
08:00:50,760 --> 08:00:52,960
I played Sam's, but not Cyberwolf.

6742
08:00:58,380 --> 08:00:59,960
PS2 was the best time period.

6743
08:01:00,120 --> 08:01:00,920
So good!

6744
08:01:02,080 --> 08:01:02,920
So good!

6745
08:01:03,000 --> 08:01:04,480
And I don't say that as just like...

6746
08:01:05,320 --> 08:01:06,280
My nostalgia!

6747
08:01:06,860 --> 08:01:08,660
But seriously, just the...

6748
08:01:08,660 --> 08:01:11,140
Graphical leaps we went through.

6749
08:01:11,860 --> 08:01:12,560
So awesome.

6750
08:01:13,080 --> 08:01:16,880
Hideo Kojima's humor has me thinking he can do Dragon Ball games slash stories...

6751
08:01:16,880 --> 08:01:19,980
Because it's very similar to Akira Toriyama's, in my opinion.

6752
08:01:21,540 --> 08:01:23,620
I can see it!

6753
08:01:24,180 --> 08:01:26,340
Oh my gosh, the new Dragon Ball game!

6754
08:01:26,340 --> 08:01:28,440
I've been watching clips of it...

6755
08:01:28,440 --> 08:01:30,720
That have been appearing in my Twitter timeline...

6756
08:01:30,720 --> 08:01:32,000
And I'm...

6757
08:01:32,760 --> 08:01:33,840
I'm dying!

6758
08:01:34,340 --> 08:01:35,580
It looks so fun!

6759
08:01:36,080 --> 08:01:37,940
It looks so...

6760
08:01:39,060 --> 08:01:41,120
It looks so funny too!

6761
08:01:46,400 --> 08:01:49,020
PS2 had Ace Combat, so it's automatically peak.

6762
08:01:51,620 --> 08:01:52,140
Yeah...

6763
08:01:54,020 --> 08:01:56,020
I don't know, I'm not gonna...

6764
08:01:57,960 --> 08:01:59,160
I say, I don't know.

6765
08:02:00,020 --> 08:02:03,440
I think only like until a couple of years ago...

6766
08:02:03,440 --> 08:02:05,020
Did it really just kind of...

6767
08:02:06,400 --> 08:02:06,920
Plateau.

6768
08:02:08,800 --> 08:02:12,000
We were doing well for a long time...

6769
08:02:12,000 --> 08:02:14,680
In terms of games and stuff.

6770
08:02:15,040 --> 08:02:17,240
But only in recent years did it kind of plateau.

6771
08:02:19,860 --> 08:02:23,380
Like I wouldn't say PS3 is better than PS2...

6772
08:02:23,380 --> 08:02:24,580
Or PS2 is better than PS1.

6773
08:02:24,740 --> 08:02:26,860
I think that whole...

6774
08:02:26,860 --> 08:02:29,040
Or even like Xbox or whatever...

6775
08:02:29,040 --> 08:02:31,020
I think that whole...

6776
08:02:31,640 --> 08:02:34,120
Time frame was just awesome.

6777
08:02:35,080 --> 08:02:38,380
And now we're at where we're at, so...

6778
08:02:39,020 --> 08:02:41,900
I guess we'll see where games go from here.

6779
08:02:43,600 --> 08:02:44,200
Yeah...

6780
08:02:47,780 --> 08:02:49,800
We became too expensive to develop.

6781
08:02:49,900 --> 08:02:51,900
Oh my gosh, you have video games that are like...

6782
08:02:52,440 --> 08:02:54,800
With budgets of like millions of dollars.

6783
08:02:56,460 --> 08:02:57,060
Why?

6784
08:03:01,820 --> 08:03:03,020
It's crazy.

6785
08:03:06,700 --> 08:03:08,200
It's so crazy.

6786
08:03:08,860 --> 08:03:10,340
Hundreds of millions even sometimes.

6787
08:03:10,500 --> 08:03:10,800
Yeah!

6788
08:03:10,800 --> 08:03:11,000
Yeah!

6789
08:03:13,420 --> 08:03:17,200
GTA 6 is a billion dollars!

6790
08:03:20,060 --> 08:03:20,580
No...

6791
08:03:21,500 --> 08:03:22,540
No way.

6792
08:03:29,600 --> 08:03:32,820
There were millions of dollars back in the 2000s.

6793
08:03:32,980 --> 08:03:33,620
Two at least.

6794
08:03:34,000 --> 08:03:34,780
I guess...

6795
08:03:34,780 --> 08:03:36,680
I don't know, but it just like doesn't feel the same, you know.

6796
08:03:37,740 --> 08:03:40,520
Because I feel like they actually invested in...

6797
08:03:40,520 --> 08:03:42,740
In developing the tech...

6798
08:03:43,340 --> 08:03:44,240
Back then.

6799
08:03:44,240 --> 08:03:46,700
And nowadays it's like...

6800
08:03:46,700 --> 08:03:48,060
Hmm...

6801
08:03:48,060 --> 08:03:51,720
Do you guys want to see every grain of...

6802
08:03:51,720 --> 08:03:52,120
Dirt?

6803
08:03:54,040 --> 08:03:55,320
Please clap.

6804
08:04:03,020 --> 08:04:03,820
Anyway...

6805
08:04:03,820 --> 08:04:06,440
This was...

6806
08:04:06,440 --> 08:04:07,900
Fine, this is so much fun.

6807
08:04:07,980 --> 08:04:08,580
Thank you guys.

6808
08:04:08,880 --> 08:04:10,300
Exit the secret theater?

6809
08:04:10,480 --> 08:04:10,920
Yes.

6810
08:04:16,880 --> 08:04:17,480
Oh...

6811
08:04:21,160 --> 08:04:22,680
Trine Princess, thank you!

6812
08:04:23,340 --> 08:04:24,260
Thank you guys!

6813
08:04:25,220 --> 08:04:25,640
Duel.

6814
08:04:25,920 --> 08:04:26,820
Wait, what's duel?

6815
08:04:27,760 --> 08:04:28,900
Online mode.

6816
08:04:30,520 --> 08:04:31,640
What is duel?

6817
08:04:32,980 --> 08:04:34,880
Yeah, and there is also snake versus monkey.

6818
08:04:35,740 --> 08:04:36,640
Oh, boss fights.

6819
08:04:36,740 --> 08:04:37,220
OK, OK.

6820
08:04:38,060 --> 08:04:38,720
Boss rush.

6821
08:04:40,280 --> 08:04:43,240
Thank you guys for...

6822
08:04:47,160 --> 08:04:47,660
More...

6823
08:04:48,780 --> 08:04:50,720
For finishing Metal Gear Solid 3.

6824
08:04:50,960 --> 08:04:53,580
We'll take a little break in between the games.

6825
08:04:56,160 --> 08:04:59,440
Metal Gear Solid 4 will do a number on my heart.

6826
08:04:59,600 --> 08:05:00,760
So I need to prepare.

6827
08:05:03,660 --> 08:05:07,560
Probably I won't do any more Metal Gear until after my new model.

6828
08:05:08,820 --> 08:05:13,440
But then I'll do, like I said, Ghost Babble and Metal Gear Solid Acid.

6829
08:05:13,940 --> 08:05:15,820
And Snake's Revenge.

6830
08:05:16,580 --> 08:05:20,240
And all the games that I haven't touched, the older ones.

6831
08:05:20,660 --> 08:05:23,100
I'm not very much looking forward to Acid.

6832
08:05:23,300 --> 08:05:26,880
I might change my mind about when I'll play it.

6833
08:05:27,220 --> 08:05:30,920
I might just do Ghost Babble and Snake's Revenge and leave Acid for another time.

6834
08:05:30,980 --> 08:05:31,360
Who knows?

6835
08:05:33,420 --> 08:05:33,900
But...

6836
08:05:33,900 --> 08:05:36,400
Since it's spooky season, you gotta play some spooky games.

6837
08:05:36,460 --> 08:05:37,000
I know!

6838
08:05:37,980 --> 08:05:39,680
I know, I know, I know.

6839
08:05:40,500 --> 08:05:43,420
I have lots of spooky games coming up.

6840
08:05:43,860 --> 08:05:47,240
And some non-spooky things, but some spooky adjacent things.

6841
08:05:47,620 --> 08:05:51,420
Coming up this week and next week.

6842
08:05:51,840 --> 08:05:55,400
And then after that...

6843
08:05:56,000 --> 08:05:56,740
Oh wait.

6844
08:05:56,940 --> 08:05:57,880
No, no, no, no!

6845
08:05:58,560 --> 08:06:01,720
And then after that I have my 3.0!

6846
08:06:03,940 --> 08:06:06,740
Thank you guys for Metal Gear Solid 3.

6847
08:06:08,100 --> 08:06:11,900
And remember to always stay loyal to the mission!

6848
08:06:13,800 --> 08:06:14,400
Otsuminta!

6849
08:06:15,720 --> 08:06:16,900
Thank you guys!

6850
08:06:16,980 --> 08:06:17,820
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

6851
08:06:18,280 --> 08:06:23,440
Schedule for this week might be a little bit delayed, but I am streaming on Monday, tomorrow.

6852
08:06:25,620 --> 08:06:27,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

6853
08:06:27,460 --> 08:06:29,820
I'm finalizing something for this weekend.

6854
08:06:29,820 --> 08:06:32,820
But, uh...

6855
08:06:36,260 --> 08:06:37,380
Yes, and...

6856
08:06:38,200 --> 08:06:42,100
Oh wait, actually, well I am still finalizing it for this weekend.

6857
08:06:43,140 --> 08:06:43,460
But yeah!

6858
08:06:45,040 --> 08:06:45,600
Otsumita!

6859
08:06:46,180 --> 08:06:47,080
Thank you guys!

6860
08:06:47,340 --> 08:06:48,600
Congrats again, Big Boss!

6861
08:06:48,680 --> 08:06:49,180
Thank you!

6862
08:06:50,040 --> 08:06:50,840
Thank you guys!

6863
08:06:50,940 --> 08:06:51,860
Yeah, we did it!

6864
08:06:51,900 --> 08:06:52,200
Woohoo!

6865
08:06:52,820 --> 08:06:55,060
I will see you guys next time!

6866
08:06:56,280 --> 08:06:56,840
Itterasshai!

6867
08:06:57,500 --> 08:06:58,060
Bye bye!

6868
08:06:58,060 --> 08:06:59,480
Thank you!
