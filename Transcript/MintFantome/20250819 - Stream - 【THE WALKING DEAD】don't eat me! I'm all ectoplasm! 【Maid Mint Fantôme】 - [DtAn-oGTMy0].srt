00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,510
Hello, hello, hello!

00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,490
Welcome, welcome back!

3
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,190
Welcome, welcome back!

4
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,010
I wonder if this is your first stream ever.

5
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,370
Howdy.

6
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,430
Oh my gosh.

7
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,950
First ever.

8
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,970
Hello, hi everybody.

9
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,510
Hi, hi.

10
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,170
Hi, hi, hi.

11
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:10,930
Hi, hi.

12
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,190
Hi, hi.

13
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,310
Can we get a nya?

14
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:18,510
Nya.

15
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,200
Can I get a hype?

16
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,020
Hype.

17
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,640
One second.

18
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,420
Okay, there we go.

19
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,420
Nya.

20
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,240
Nya.

21
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,380
Wait, one second.

22
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,040
Also, the game feels a little loud.

23
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,140
Wait.

24
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,020
Where is it?

25
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,600
Oh, it's me.

26
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,820
I'm a loud one.

27
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,000
My headphones were turned up.

28
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,820
Sorry, I know you can't hear it right now.

29
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,120
Oh, I knew it.

30
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,820
I knew it.

31
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,500
Sorry, I had a setting that I turned off.

32
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,000
And I was like, wait a second.

33
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,180
I don't think I turned it back on.

34
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,180
First time here, what's with this talking cat?

35
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm the cat of the sewers.

36
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,490
I'll make your, I'll grant you one wish.

37
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,770

38
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,570

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,650

Apparently, it, like, makes you love your cat.

48
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,310

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,570
Yeah, it looks like a snack.

52
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,970
Would you do the honor of showing a little bit of stummy?

53
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,590
My goodness.

54
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,650

57
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,190

59
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:25,890
Money goes to tummy.

60
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,030

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,730
I wonder if I'll be blocking any text.

68
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,770
We'll adjust as we go along.

69
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,390
We shall adjust.

70
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,230
MGS boxes.

71
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,090
Get your MGS boxes.

72
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,070
Oh, wait.

73
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:08,350
I saw someone say that they re-put the MGS boxes for Peace Walker and for, but I already ordered them.

74
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:44,490
So, but I don't want to spend another lot of money I spend so much money on stinking metal gear acrylic standees you guys because they're releasing standees acrylic standees of every character every game and so I was like I really have no place for this I have nowhere to put these little guys but I I I can't resist Even the grunts,

75
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,690
I think there was, uh, I think MGS1 had the genome soldier.

76
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,370
The box for the acrylic standies of the MGS, of MGS1.

77
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:06,510
And so I was like, oh my gosh, I want to have like 15 pies acrylic standies, but I'll have just one.

78
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,350
I'll take just one, you know.

79
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,830
But, oh, I couldn't resist.

80
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,870
I was like, give me more plastic.

81
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,170
More plastic.

82
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,110
More plastic.

83
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:23,210
I want to collect all the plastic.

84
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,370
You guys know that audio?

85
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,990
That's just like, I don't want to, I don't want to, I don't actually remember what the actual audio is.

86
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,990
But it's like, I don't want to do this thing.

87
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,910
But the parasites, the parasites told me to do this thing.

88
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:43,810
I don't want to, it's like, I don't want to drink.

89
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,190
I can remember.

90
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,070
It's like, I don't want to eat that cake.

91
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,650
I don't want to eat it.

92
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,270
But the parasites, the parasites tell me to know.

93
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,010
Oh yeah, I don't want candy.

94
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,050
I don't want to eat that candy.

95
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,270
But the parasites, that's me.

96
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,850
I don't want acrylic stands.

97
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,470
Shelf fund.

98
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,970
From someone who frequently runs out of space for plastic.

99
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:11,790
I recently boxed up.

100
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,130
Here I'll let the music or the sound.

101
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,110
sound effects play again.

102
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,210
I recently boxed up a bunch of figures that I will be taking.

103
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:23,790
I sometimes box my figures up and take them with me to Japan and then sell them.

104
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:25,290
Like Mandarake.

105
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:28,510
And so I was just like, well, I need more space.

106
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,930
So I did that with some figures.

107
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,930
Can't say do the work, but really happy you're playing one of my favorite games of my birthday.

108
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,210
Zenova, happy birthday.

109
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:43,150
Good luck with work.

110
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,370
Good luck, good luck.

111
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,990
Oh, did someone...

112
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:48,490
Did someone write?

113
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,310
Thank you for the break!

114
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,390
Thank you, thank you!

115
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:51,750
Hey, kids.

116
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,710
Thank you so much for the gifted.

117
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,750
Ducky, thanks for the gifted.

118
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:55,190
Miguel, welcome back.

119
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:55,810
Thank you.

120
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,690
Or welcome?

121
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,810
Wait, I can't tell.

122
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,610
I can't remember what's the...

123
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,340
I don't remember what the...

124
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,260
I changed recently the membership little icons.

125
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,640
I can't remember what's what.

126
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,340
Call me a zombie the way I want to...

127
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't say that.

128
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm not finishing this message.

129
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,340
I'm not doing it.

130
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,380
I'm not doing it.

131
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,020
Wrong, Parama.

132
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,700
Thank you so much for the fun, good to thank you.

133
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,340
Dwarago, thank you for the fun, good to...

134
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,860
Thank you, guys.

135
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

136
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,880
There's really nothing wrong with getting more Metal Gear merch.

137
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:35,940
Yeah.

138
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,420
I have too much stuff.

139
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:39,980
Ah!

140
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,780
Got a new motorbike on the day of your new outfit.

141
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,740
It's orange and black, so I'm thinking of naming it the Cyber Tiger.

142
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,100
Wait, that's so good!

143
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,580
That's so good!

144
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,060
Phil, thank you for the five-git-git-git-vibigoy, thank you for the five-git-git-tigoo!

145
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,840
Inside about the Slayer song.

146
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,820
Even though it was so scuffed.

147
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,730
Yeah.

148
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,350
But this is my first time ever playing the Walking Dead game.

149
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:19,190
I have seen other people play it, but I did not, like, watch, you know?

150
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,950
Like, I was like, oh, this evening, I want to try it myself.

151
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,190
So, I have held off.

152
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:32,710
So, this is all brand new, first-time experience.

153
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,730
I have no prior knowledge of anything.

154
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,690
Or comics?

155
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,310
No, I never read the comics.

156
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,850
I watched the show up to Negan, which I feel like was a lot of people.

157
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,510
I feel that was quite a bunch of people.

158
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:59,550
So, uh, also, uh, I have a cover coming out tomorrow with a Nimi Nightmare.

159
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:12,310
So, um, so, uh, I have a pinned, pinned link in the, in, in the, uh, comments?

160
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,410
Yeah, in the comments.

161
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,810
And, um, if you're watching the VOD, it might be out.

162
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,990
So you should go watch.

163
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,450
Listen.

164
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,650
Yes, yes, yes.

165
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,470
Is that what I'm wearing in the apocalypse?

166
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:31,210
Oh, yeah.

167
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:31,930
I don't know.

168
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,650
I kind of...

169
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:39,090
That's like a genre I really like is like the...

170
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,650
Kind of like a...

171
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,110
I...

172
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,810
Well, actually, so more than post-apocalyptic settings, I like watching the...

173
00:14:47,770 --> 00:15:54,530
That time when all the chaos is happening, like the pre-apocalypse but like when everything like i like seeing patient zero you know what i mean i like seeing how it how everything starts to spiral yeah the collapse it's so freaky but i it's like it's like i can't look away it's so fascinating to me so have i ever played fallout i haven't but i do want to i do want to try it one day the beginning of the end yes yes yes I think it's I've mentioned this this movie slash TV series quite a few times before but the stand like Stephen King's the stand I think part one is all like the everything's going down and I can remember that part so well I watched it so often as a young wisp I was a wee,

174
00:15:54,710 --> 00:16:01,610
I was a wee little wisp, and I was like, I was like that to my screen, like, watching everything happen.

175
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,730
But I don't remember anything in part two.

176
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,530
I don't remember.

177
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,390
I don't even know what happens.

178
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,090
I just...

179
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,570
I don't know what happens.

180
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,370
Did you watch It?

181
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,270
Like, Stephen King?

182
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:25,550
It?

183
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,430
The new one?

184
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,190
Yes.

185
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,790
Yeah, I think I actually recently watched it on the plane.

186
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,390
Artemis, thank you so much for the five kids!

187
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,090
Thank you!

188
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,330
Thank you, thank you.

189
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,650
Hope that you and everyone else here have a great day.

190
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,170
White Wolf, thank you, you too!

191
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,630
You too, you too, you too.

192
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,570
What about the prequel?

193
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:58,750
That.

194
00:16:59,370 --> 00:16:59,690
It.

195
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,450
It?

196
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,070
What?

197
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,590
What would be like?

198
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,410
So you have it and then you have...

199
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,190
Oh yeah, that.

200
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,030
My brain wanted to say there.

201
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,350
But that's...

202
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,050
That's incorrect.

203
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,590
Then?

204
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,610
It's been a while since I so bought a scary day.

205
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,890
Kai is trying to pull me out of my coworker out of a vehicle?

206
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,150
Monster, are you okay?

207
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,810
I hope you're okay.

208
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,050
Recently started playing the MGS games.

209
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,410
I hope you like them.

210
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,030
I hope you like them.

211
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:49,150
I saw somebody in pre-chat say that they got to the part of MGS2 where they were talking about King Kong.

212
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,910
That's what I was talking about.

213
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,190
When I mentioned King Kong.

214
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,630
Yes.

215
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,330
It, too.

216
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,730
Penny wiser.

217
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:02,710
Penny.

218
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,430
No.

219
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:06,390
What if he's not penny?

220
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,890
What if he becomes nickel or dime?

221
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:12,490
Quarter.

222
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,630
Two penny, two wise.

223
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:44,120
then also known as tony hawk's existential nightmare i love how how people just can't recognize tony hawk they'll be like oh man you you you're pretty good at skating or they'll be like you look just like tony hawk

224
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,760
do a kickflip

225
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,440
Pennywise Dollar Dumb

226
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:28,670
That's me I'm a Dollar Dumb I'm a Wait I'm I wanna be I wanna be a Shiny quarter He's like if Pliskin picked up a skateboard Wait Ugh Dumb apparently Dolly Parton once went to Dolly Parton look-alike contests and lost miserably.

227
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:32,510
Wait, I literally was reading about that yesterday.

228
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:52,170
Like, actually, because I was watching a video of Adele doing the same thing, where she went to an Adele contest, and they were all singing, like, the same song, and then actual Adele went last, and she started singing, and one of the Adele look-alike girls was like,

229
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,010
like, Like, almost immediately, she was just kind of sitting there, like, listening.

230
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:14,210
And then she goes, But, and so that it kind of got me into a rabbit hole of, like, like, the Dolly Parton one, too, how she went, how she participated in the Dolly Parton lookalong.

231
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,170
Lookalong contests and lost.

232
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,290
It's kind of insane.

233
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:26,270
But with Adele, she apparently wore, like, prosthetics, like, a different nose and stuff, so people...

234
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,350
Wouldn't realize it's her.

235
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:36,850
Remember, anyone that you let die is a personal and moral failing!

236
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:43,900
Okay.

237
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,920
Not on my conscious.

238
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,120
I'm eager to watch Stephen King's The Long Walk movie.

239
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,520
I forgot to read it, but my wife did and she loved it.

240
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,900
Oh, wait, is there a new movie coming out?

241
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,280
It's them, us, him, and you.

242
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:05,260
Wait, yeah, wait, those are all horror thrillers, aren't they?

243
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:06,560
That's crazy.

244
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,180
That's so crazy.

245
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,420
Ninja Shadow, welcome to Babyship to Haku.

246
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,360
Did she wear a clown nose as a disguise?

247
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,340
She, she, she, she, she.

248
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:21,920
She.

249
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,460
I think that would be the best disguise.

250
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:54,500
guys um but yeah i guess we'll get started walking dead time i will do my best to keep people alive and also try to be your best with uh about spoilers since this is my first time playing okay

251
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:36,270
uh choose a display style more help from ui and feedback when you make important choices turn off UI hints and choice notification Glenn will remember you lie settings can be changed later a standard better since I've never played this before maybe standard okay episode one a new day I'm gonna keep everybody alive I promise.

252
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,910
But not pinky promise, because this game series adapts to the choices you make.

253
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,670
The story is tailored to how you play.

254
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,690
But I'm not going to pinky promise, because if you break your promise, you'll break your pinky.

255
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,030
The Walking Dead.

256
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:02,650
The narrator.

257
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:03,850
She didn't.

258
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,750
Episode 1.

259
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:07,490
A new day.

260
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,700
Are we going to be in handcuffs the whole game?

261
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,840
That would be...

262
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,720
That would be...

263
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,320
Intense.

264
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,340
Don't look at me!

265
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:36,090
Well, sky's on the road, mister.

266
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,010
Well, I reckon you didn't do it then.

267
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,770
Uh-oh, are there no subtitles?

268
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,150
Uh, oh, use the mouse wheel to select a response.

269
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,230
You know what they say about reckoning.

270
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:51,190
Oh, does it really matter?

271
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,590
Yeah.

272
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,290
Let's be done.

273
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,570
Does it really matter?

274
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:55,250
Nah, not much.

275
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,090
Hold on.

276
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,530
I'm gonna have settings.

277
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:59,250
Audio?

278
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,470
So, uh, graphics?

279
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,370
Eh?

280
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,050
Gameplay?

281
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:13,930
Subtitles?

282
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,350
Gameplay?

283
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,650
Why are they automatically off?

284
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,910
Is there anything else I should turn on?

285
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,010
Show controller, uh, I don't know.

286
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,470
Thank you guys.

287
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,230
Resume.

288
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,410
You know, I've driven a bunch of fellas down to this prison.

289
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,950
Lord knows how many.

290
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,250
Usually it's about now I get the, I didn't do it.

291
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,190
I didn't do it.

292
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,650
And what do you say?

293
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,130
Not for me.

294
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,510
Every time?

295
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,170
Yeah, I doubt all these guys are doing this every time.

296
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:42,990
Every time?

297
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:44,890
Really?

298
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,690
I didn't do it, officer.

299
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:49,550
It wasn't me.

300
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,930
He's here, P3A6, 285.

301
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,430
Wow.

302
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:54,990
Are

303
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,130
you looking at me?

304
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,030
Is he getting a wink at me?

305
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,430
I followed your case a little bit.

306
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,050
You being a making boy, no?

307
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,890
A baking boy?

308
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,850
Oh, so you're from making them?

309
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,170
You're from making, Ben?

310
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,990
Yep, came up to Atlanta to be a city cop in the 70s.

311
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,130
Oh, that's right.

312
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,090
This takes place in Atlanta.

313
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,710
Like that senatorial mess you got yourself mixed up in.

314
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,510
With all due respect.

315
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,950
We're going to Phantom Thief.

316
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:25,650
A real shit.

Or she married the wrong guy.

320
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,390
Oh.

321
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,290
It was such a fast...

322
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,010
Such a fast decision.

323
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:49,530
Grrr.

324
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,270
It's all going down, you guys.

325
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:52,790
Uh-oh.

326
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:54,970
Wait, where is he taking me?

327
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,630
I'm driving this man once.

328
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,050
He was the worst one.

329
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,450
stop going on about how he didn't do it.

330
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,470
He was an older fella.

331
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,810
Big soft eyes behind a pair of smart folk glasses.

332
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,790
And he's just wailing back there.

333
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,890
Says it wasn't him.

334
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,110
Why are you passing in the right lane, huh?

335
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:12,970
Right where you sit.

336
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,790
Why is everybody going so slow in the left lane?

337
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,110
It's making me annoyed.

338
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,610
Like a fussy baby on an airplane.

339
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,350
I'm not telling him he's got to stop.

340
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,450
That's government property and I'll be forced to zap him on the road.

341
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,510
You're making me anxious.

342
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,690
Haven't exhausted all his options.

343
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,910
He starts crying out for his mama.

344
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:33,350
Oh.

345
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:36,070
Mama, it's all a big mistake.

346
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,490
It wasn't me.

347
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,150
It wasn't me.

348
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,110
Were you driving goofy?

349
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,030
So did he do it?

350
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,610
So did he do it?

351
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,210
They caught the fucker red-handed.

352
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,930
Stabbing his wife, cutting her up as the boys came through the door.

353
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,990
He sits in my car screaming bloody murder that it wasn't him.

354
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,230
I think he actually believed it himself.

355
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,530
Oh my gosh.

356
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:14,630

357
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,110

I called it.

361
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,090
I knew it would happen.

362
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,330
I kept seeing this man.

363
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,930
Stop looking at the road.

364
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,110
I knew it.

365
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,070
I knew it.

366
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,760
Oh.

367
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh.

368
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,660
Oh.

369
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,620
Oh.

370
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:03,660
Shit.

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,380
Thanks.

372
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,340
Thirsty.

373
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,560
Oh.

374
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,500
Fuck.

375
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,560
Oh.

376
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:11,760
Oh.

377
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:43,020
Uh oh Uh oh Use the mouse to look around Find a look at shotgun We have a window Kick in the window With our leg What the hell did he have his gun out Why does he have a shotgun Also just let me know I know my hair kind of is is big.

378
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:51,380
If you need me to put on another hairstyle, I can so I'm not blocking as much of the subtitles.

379
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,940
Now I want her to play the wolf among us.

380
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,180
Thank you so much for the Akasupa bread.

381
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,780
Thank you.

382
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,540
Make it bigger.

383
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,760
It's all good.

384
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,240
Bald!

385
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,580
One more!

386
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,540
One more!

387
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,260
What?

388
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,930
Okay, let's not make so much...

389
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,580
Let's not make so much noise.

390
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,360
Now move towards the window using W.

391
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,300
Wait, what's it saying?

392
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,840
I need to drag myself out that window.

393
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,960
Oh, shimmy, shimmy.

394
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,980
Look at the door.

395
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,400
Use the mouse wheel to select an action.

396
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,280
Oh, okay.

397
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,020
I was wondering what the gameplay would be like in this.

398
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,360
Try fog.

399
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,250
Don't look at him.

400
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,530
Use W to move along the car.

401
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,980
Isn't this a serious game?

402
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,900
Oh my gosh, don't go up to that guy, please.

403
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,420
Or grab the gun, please.

404
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,840
Oh my gosh.

405
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,330
Shotgun shell.

406
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,850
So we did shoot.

407
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,300
Okay.

408
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,700
The officer's shotgun is over there.

409
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,780
Yeah, grab it.

410
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,320
Oh, grab it.

411
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,240
Why would he have needed that?

412
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,320
His facial expressions?

413
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,380
Well, he's just kind of like...

414
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,460
Look, I'll do it again.

415
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,480
Oh, wait.

416
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,580
Now he's picking it up.

417
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,400
I did that before, though.

418
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,040
Looks empty.

419
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,860
Yeah, let's take that.

420
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,340
It'll be easier to carry with these cups off.

421
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:54,860
Oh, gosh.

422
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:58,480
I was going to say, let's grab it before we go over to him, though.

423
00:31:59,060 --> 00:31:59,540
Oh.

424
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:36,930
officer oh is this the keys on him or in the car damn oh my god officer officer officer god damn officer officer officer officer damn where's the keys in the car Okay, the way he's staring at me.

425
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,080
Go, officer.

426
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,580
Pick it up.

427
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,140
Take it, though.

428
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,920
I don't like all the crap.

429
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:49,540
King's out.

430
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,100
Looks empty.

431
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,760
It'll be easier to carry with these cuffs off.

432
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,800
Am I missing something?

433
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm already lost.

434
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:04,580
Gotta get close.

435
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,360
Oh, I thought I was pretty close.

436
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:07,560
No?

437
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:09,720
Ah!

438
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:10,620
Oh no.

439
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,040
Oh, this is a grabby grab scene.

440
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,280
Oh my gosh.

441
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,480
Oh my gosh.

442
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:15,920
Look at that!

443
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,120
That's the face of a man that is turned.

444
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:19,720
Officer?

445
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,560
Um...

446
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,040
Okay, I'm ready for the QTE.

447
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,060
Oh yeah.

448
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,020
Yeah.

449
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,560
Good, good plan.

450
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,180
Good plan.

451
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
My man is smart.

452
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,020
Nice.

453
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,320
Oh my gosh.

454
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:03,860
Oh my gosh.

455
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,020
I know.

456
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,740
Okay, it saves.

457
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:13,920
Ow!

458
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,640
Estabar, I'm going!

459
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:20,980
What in the hell?

460
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,220
What in the hell?

461
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,300
Where the fuck are you?

462
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
Where's the shotgun?

463
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,460
I'm pressing...

464
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,580
I'm pressing S to get away.

465
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,200
There we go.

466
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,560
I was stuck on something, I think.

467
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,360
Grab the shotgun!

468
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,390
I have no qualms about it.

469
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,690
Oh, I thought I missed because he jerked his head back.

470
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm definitely going to jail now.

471
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,680
Out of the frying pan, complete chapter one of episode one.

472
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,560
The skin's all rotten and he smells like shit.

475
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,380
How have so many people turned already?

476
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,020
Sorry, it's lagging a little bit.

477
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,700
I don't know why.

478
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,760
Whoa, whoa, it's lagging a lot.

479
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,600
Is this normal?

480
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
Yeah, it's normal.

481
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,100
Oh, that's fine.

482
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,140
Oh, he's so strong.

483
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,280
Oh, my gosh.

484
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,760
Oh, I thought they were in the yard, too.

485
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,660
Is the game not me?

486
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,220
Thanks for the reassurance.

487
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,360
This used to be on iOS?

488
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,200
No way.

489
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,370
How did so many people turn so fast?

490
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,090

You're scaring me, mister.

502
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,290

503
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,830

Fruit.

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,290
A bowl of fruit.

510
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:46,890
Yeah, take one.

511
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,290
It's fake.

512
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:48,690
Oh.

513
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:53,870
Dang, people and their fake-ass fruit.

514
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:55,750
Bookshelf.

515
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:57,110
Furniture overturned.

516
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:57,970
Blood everywhere.

517
00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,510
Jesus.

518
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,570
Though, I kind of get it.

519
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,150
Because, like, fake fruit will never attract flies.

520
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,310
Just saying.

521
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:13,270
God, that kid lived here.

522
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,430
Clementine.

523
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,970
Ugh, cable's out.

00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:52,410
Patient zero.

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:54,970
Um, how old are you?

553
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:55,770

555
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:56,990

00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,630
She knows 911.

557
00:42:59,530 --> 00:42:59,870
Yes.

558
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:02,190
I don't know where anybody is.

559
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:03,590
Wait, your parents went to Savannah?

560
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,230
I'm...

561
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,110
When you're eight years old and left you here?

562
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:07,510
Okay.

563
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:08,590
I'm 37.

564
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:11,450
Where are your parents?

565
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,110
Where are your parents?

566
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,810
They took a trip and left me with Sandra.

567
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,630
They're in Savannah, I think.

568
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:19,970
Where the boats are?

569
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:22,650
Are you safe?

570
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,810
Oh, yeah, where are you?

571
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:24,750
Where are you?

572
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:26,650
I'm outside in my tree house.

573
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:27,310
Oh.

574
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,290
They can't get in.

575
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:29,030
Oh.

576
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,610
That's smart.

577
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:30,170
Okay.

578
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:31,070
See?

579
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,390
Can you see me?

580
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,070
I can see you through the window.

581
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,390
She's so cute.

582
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:37,750
Hi.

583
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:44,830
What's cute?

584
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:45,330
Oh, sorry.

585
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:46,510
I forgot to press it.

586
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,690
I was so focused on Wasta.

587
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:52,410
Are you dead too?

588
00:43:54,110 --> 00:43:54,890
Yes, man.

589
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,050
Yes, I'm dead.

590
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:00,750
Q!

591
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:02,470
Wait, how do I do this?

592
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:02,710
Q?

593
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:03,650
Q?

594
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,210
Oh, I see!

595
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:06,730
I have to keep pressing at E?

596
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:08,230
Do I hold?

597
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:08,570
Q?

598
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:09,110
Q?

599
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:09,310
Q?

600
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:10,910
I press a lot?

601
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,570
E?

602
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:12,170
I hold?

603
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:12,750
E?

604
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:13,910
I hold?

605
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,020
Oh my god!

606
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:19,360
I'm slipping.

607
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,040
Uh...

608
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:22,360
Yeah!

609
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:24,880
Ouchie, ouchie, let's go.

610
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,080
Oh my gosh!

611
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:35,380
Oh my gosh!

612
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:36,400

613
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,520

The house has perfectly good stuff, probably.

632
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,040

I'm Chet.

637
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,300
Chet.

638
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,040
We shouldn't be out in the open like this.

639
00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:32,160
How about you help us clear the way and we'll take you and your daughter out of here and down to my family's farm.

640
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,700
It should be safer there.

641
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,140
Oh.

642
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:34,960
I'm not a dad.

643
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:36,580
I'm...

644
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,740
I'm just some guy.

645
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:39,780
Just some guy.

646
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,260
Some guy?

647
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,840
Sean noticed.

648
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,480
She's alone?

649
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:45,020
Let's get going.

650
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,860
Staying put for too long is a mistake.

651
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,340
Maybe that was the wrong thing to say.

652
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,260
Maybe that makes sense.

653
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:51,160
Maybe look a little suspicious.

654
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:51,680
Hey.

655
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,420
The monster's coming.

656
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,700
We gotta go.

657
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:58,320
Oh no!

658
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,120
Oh, what?

659
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:04,500
Okay.

660
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:07,620
If what?

661
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:09,300
Wait, what was this guy doing then?

662
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,680
You guys were both trying to push this out of the way, no?

663
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,560
Oh my gosh.

664
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,980
Even Clementine trying to help.

665
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,160
Poor sweet little baby.

666
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,220
Oh my gosh!

667
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,720
Go, go, go, go, please!

668
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:25,880
Oh, Chet!

669
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,260
For just some guy, it seems like you saved a bunch of lives today.

670
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:34,680
Oh!

671
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,580
Chet's a hero.

672
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,000
He jumped in the back.

673
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,660
He didn't have to do that.

674
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,500
He could have let us sit in the back, you know?

675
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,820
area seat.

676
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,240
We're on the farm.

677
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:03,460
I don't think this is Kansas no more.

678
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:10,920
Great.

679
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:11,500
There, by the way.

680
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:12,060
Thank you.

681
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,500
Of course I'm going to finish the game.

682
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:15,700
Hey, Sean.

683
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,300

684
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,180
My mama's going to be in a snip.

685
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,400
No sweat, man.

They're so casual about this.

688
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,000
They're so casual.

689
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,140

00:51:49,870 --> 00:51:50,410
Could be worse.

699
00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:52,290
That's what it sounds like.

700
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,870
Seems like things got awful bad in the cities.

701
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:55,310
Yeah.

702
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:56,730
What did you say your name was?

703
00:51:58,170 --> 00:51:58,890
It's Lee.

704
00:51:59,150 --> 00:51:59,590
It's Lee.

705
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,210
We'll play it nice.

706
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,090
Nice to meet you, Lee.

707
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:02,450

708
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:03,730
Herschel Green.

709
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,370
We'll play it nice.

710
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:07,530
How'd this happen?

711
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:10,770
Uh, car accident.

712
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:11,950
Car accident.

713
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:12,690
We'll be honest.

714
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,450
That's so.

715
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:16,270
Where are you headed before the car accident?

716
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:17,530
Why are you so nosy?

717
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,730
Out of Atlanta.

718
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,090
I was getting out of Atlanta.

719
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,990
The news says stay.

720
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:24,990
Yeah, well that's a mistake.

721
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:26,030
Yeah, true.

722
00:52:26,030 --> 00:53:44,450

00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:58,150
It gets hot or the swelling doesn't go down.

725
00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:00,010
You're probably dealing with an infection.

726
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:00,550
Uh-oh.

727
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:01,730
What do we do then?

728
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,550
We'll probably just have to shoot you.

729
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:07,310
Hot Clementine's face.

730
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:09,570
We'll clean it, redress it, and you'll be fine.

731
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,050
Okay, that'd be preferable.

732
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,530
There's blankets and such in the barn.

733
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:16,370
We'll be seeing you bright and early.

734
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,170
Come tomorrow, which way you think you're headed?

735
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,390
Towards making, I suppose.

736
00:54:24,610 --> 00:54:25,730
Where are we?

737
00:54:26,030 --> 00:54:57,630

Oh.

740
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,250
Aww.

741
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:11,630
Uh-oh.

742
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:13,870
Getting real ominous.

743
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,050
I love you, Barry.

744
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:18,110
What did he do?

745
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,810
Or maybe didn't do.

746
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:22,390
Whatever.

747
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,770
What occurred to be in the police car?

748
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:28,030
Hmm.

749
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:30,650

750
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:32,950
Hey, get up.

Oh, how you go, Zain, and itchy.

752
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,250
Well, you slept in a barn, little lady.

753
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,230
Lucky you don't have spiders in your hair.

754
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,670
But I bet your daddy scared him all the way, huh?

755
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:47,170
Smells like Miki.

756
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,750
My name is Miki.

757
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:49,710

758
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,410
Dad, we're in a little offense.

759
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:53,270
There's a tractor and everything.

760
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:56,030
Is that an actual child actor?

761
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,090
Because it sounds like it.

762
00:55:57,150 --> 00:55:58,310
He can't enunciate.

Good.

769
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:37,130
I'm going to drive the tractor.

770
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:39,530
I'm the foreman.

771
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:41,370
Lift with your back, Sean.

772
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:43,730
I think this is an actual child.

773
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:45,270
Boy, is that like this kid?

774
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,270
I'm going to drive the tractor.

775
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:48,210
How you doing, Duck?

776
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:48,730
Good.

777
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,170
I'm going to drive the tractor.

778
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:52,830
I'm the foreman.

779
00:57:53,450 --> 00:57:54,670
Lift with your back, Sean.

780
00:57:58,270 --> 00:57:59,130
I'm looking at it.

781
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:27,070
him oh he's waving at me this guy's so much whimsy you know how to drive it sure don't I can give you a hell of a critique he's doing his best I'm good this is does not seem like a fortified enough of a fence I think Sean's still working on that fence it needs to be much taller hey Lee need a hand need a hand that'd be Great.

782
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:30,230
If you could cut those two-byes to length, that sure speed things up.

783
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,130
Sure thing.

784
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:37,390
What is your super chat saying?

785
00:58:37,410 --> 00:58:39,450
My dad doesn't know how bad it is.

786
00:58:40,130 --> 00:58:40,910
No, he doesn't.

787
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:44,650
I saw a guy and I'm going to kill a kid.

788
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:45,750
A boy.

789
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:47,710
Just shot him right in the face.

790
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:48,470
Oh my god!

791
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,330
Was the boy one of the walkers?

792
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,430
I don't even know.

793
00:58:53,770 --> 00:58:55,830
He was either attacking the guy or asking for help.

794
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:56,590
Oh my god!

795
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:28,970

796
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:29,570
I had to!

797
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:35,070
Dad just wants to keep the family safe and thinks inviting people in is a bigger threat than whatever's out there.

798
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:36,210
I had to!

799
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:37,750
She was on top of me!

800
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:38,470
How's your family?

801
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,910
My parents are in Macon.

802
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,490
My brother and parents are in Macon.

803
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,430
Oh man, I hope so too.

804
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:48,510
Maybe it's not too bad there.

805
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:51,450
Is that far from Atlanta?

806
00:59:51,650 --> 00:59:53,130
That's probably all I need cut for now.

807
00:59:53,450 --> 00:59:53,730
Thanks.

808
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,850
Like, is it...

809
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,730
Like, are we going on an epic journey there?

810
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:02,790
Like, Lord of the Rings?

811
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:04,010
Or is it really close?

812
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:05,530
Oh, it's kind of a bit.

813
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,550
Do you think this thing will keep about...

814
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:09,930
Three to four hour drive!

815
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:13,410
I'm planning on coming back through on a fortification pass, if you will.

816
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,110
We'll lock this place up, good.

817
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,190
Okay.

818
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,050
Good luck with that.

819
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:21,170
Why is he like...

820
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,690
Why is it so sporadic?

821
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:24,530
What?

822
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:25,810
Okay.

823
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:27,630
You...

824
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:29,790
What is he doing?

825
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:31,370
Wait, they got a dog?

826
01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,390
Wait, can I see it?

827
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,030
Where's the puppy?

828
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:39,290
Wait, they got chickens?

829
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,670
Can I see them?

830
01:00:59,050 --> 01:01:01,430
I love that I can moonwalk.

831
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:03,870
Okay, this is a serious game.

832
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,470
Right?

833
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:08,870
I don't want to be joking around the whole time, but...

834
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,670
Yeah, he's got some sick moves.

835
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:18,710
I like how he just slept in the barn.

836
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:19,810
There really are...

837
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,050
This is a pretty big house.

838
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:22,190
There were no...

839
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:26,490
There were no guest rooms at all, or...

840
01:01:28,030 --> 01:01:29,850
You have such pretty hair.

841
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,550
It gets lots of tangles.

842
01:01:31,890 --> 01:01:32,130
Aw.

843
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:33,530
This is a big house!

844
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:36,050
There wasn't one room that we could sleep in.

845
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:37,130
The attic?

846
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:40,850

01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:19,850
The J word.

855
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,590
Clementine was just telling me about first grade.

856
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:24,070
Oh, um, how's that?

857
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:25,510
It's easy.

858
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:26,790
Well, yeah.

859
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,290

So, you good?

861
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:35,610
Anyway, it's almost like we didn't see people eating each other for the past three days.

862
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,330
Stupid girl can't pass first grade.

863
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:38,850
Back in a bit.

864
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:39,810
Okay, Lee.

865
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,310
as a first grader.

866
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,770
Uh, duh, stupid dummy.

867
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,450
It's first graders for babies.

868
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,960
Seems like those two are getting along.

869
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:54,620
Aw.

870
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,740

01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:02,660
Kicks, oh wait, what's that say?

872
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,920
Lake something kicks bass.

873
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,940
Wait, I want to look at Kenny first.

874
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,920

877
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,120
Yeah, he would not be on the lake.

878
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,220
He would be on the, on the ocean.

879
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,840
Need any help?

880
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:34,540

01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,380
No, I think I got it.

882
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:37,920
Okay.

883
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,460
Do you need any help?

884
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,160
What do you mean?

885
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,780
I mean and taking care of that little girl.

886
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:44,960
You know what you're doing?

887
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,520
You got kids of your own?

888
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:49,320
Uh, I have no idea.

889
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,900
I have no idea what I'm doing.

890
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,920
At least you're honest.

891
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:53,540
I am.

892
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:53,900
Shit.

893
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,000
Better than I was when Duck showed up.

894
01:05:56,540 --> 01:05:57,420
You'll figure it out.

895
01:05:58,780 --> 01:05:59,660
How's your son doing?

896
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:00,460
How's your son doing?

897
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,200
Good, I think.

898
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,380
Kachie's got a sister up in Memphis.

899
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,060
We were coming back from visiting her.

900
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:07,600
Casino in my slot life.

901
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:11,080

905
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:46,860

906
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,640
Pretty sick, huh?

01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:00,880
Duck.

908
01:07:03,880 --> 01:07:04,460
Hey duck.

909
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:10,120
Gosh, someone from Florida wouldn't name their kid duck, huh?

910
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,260
That's such a Florida...

911
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:13,460
Oh!

912
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,600
Mr. Mann's out here.

913
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,130
I always read those at Slut Live, yeah!

914
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:25,950
Kenny today, I wouldn't stand for your lack of honesty last night.

915
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:28,550
I'm not sure I follow.

916
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:29,050
Uh-oh.

917
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:30,850
I ain't dumb.

918
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,450
I caught you in that lie last night about who you were with in that car.

919
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:37,430
And honestly, I don't even want to know.

920
01:07:38,630 --> 01:07:40,250
How'd you get out of Atlanta?

921
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:44,590
Oh, I got a ride.

922
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:46,670
I got a ride and then I was in a wreck.

923
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,910
I walked until your boy found me.

924
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:49,470
Yeah.

925
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:52,310
Well, you're no worse for where.

926
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:55,510
This farm's a nice plot of land.

927
01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:01,270
Had you told me 20 years ago I'd still be doing this, I would have told you that you were full of crap.

928
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:02,750
Never was a plan.

929
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:04,350
Having a place like this.

930
01:08:04,770 --> 01:08:07,450
It was in the family, and I guess so was I.

931
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:09,030
Family's important.

932
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,390
It's all that matters.

933
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:11,290
Right, Jill.

934
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,290
Do you agree with that?

935
01:08:12,750 --> 01:08:13,750
Was brought up too?

936
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:14,350
Yes.

937
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:16,230
Where's your family now?

938
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:17,270
Parents?

it's true it's honest give you a piece of advice what uh what is it what is it i don't know who you are what you did let's say things don't get better back in the cities or they get worse before they do you're gonna have to depend on the honesty of strangers if you're gonna make it and if those same people get to questioning yours you're gonna be in trouble oh and i'd start checking the attitude,

941
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,050
friend.

942
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:12,210
I don't have an attitude!

943
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:16,270
Go!

944
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,410
I'll get my gun.

945
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:18,950
Oh my god, already?

946
01:09:21,150 --> 01:09:21,630
Oh,

948
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:39,950
Wait, I have to save one?

949
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,230
You chose to save Duck.

950
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:44,810
Wait, I shouldn't have saved...

951
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:45,050
Oh, wait.

952
01:09:47,410 --> 01:09:47,890
Oh.

953
01:09:48,650 --> 01:09:50,850
I should have... I should have saved the other guy.

954
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:51,810
Take me!

955
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:56,350
Yeah, let his dad save him.

956
01:09:56,990 --> 01:09:57,730
Kick him.

957
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,890
I'll punch him.

958
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:01,530
Okay, now let's save Sean.

959
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:06,690
Oh yeah, we gotta do that.

960
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:09,910
Oh my god.

961
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:10,790
Ah!

962
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:11,850
Oh no!

963
01:10:12,730 --> 01:10:12,910
Oh!

964
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,440
Sean!

965
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:29,460
Sean!

966
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,180
Oh, Sean.

967
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,300
At least he's pinned.

968
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,420
Kenny, you coward.

969
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,300
What the hell?

970
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:38,620
Ran off with this kid.

971
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,340
I saved the kid because I felt like he was weaker.

972
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:43,900
Oh.

973
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:46,900
And that he...

974
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:48,660
Get the fuck out of here!

975
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,680
And that Sean could take care of himself.

976
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,300
But Sean did have two guys on him.

977
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:52,760
Sorry.

978
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,740
Your son is alive.

979
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,520
You don't get to be sorry.

980
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:58,460
And you...

981
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,440
I thought I could save both.

982
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,920
I didn't even try to help.

983
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,060
I'm so...

984
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:05,560
I thought I could...

985
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,100
I thought I could help them, but...

986
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:07,660
I did!

987
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,060
Look at him.

988
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:10,780
You thought wrong.

989
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,460
And now...

990
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:15,520
Is there a way to save both of them or no?

991
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:16,340
Just go.

992
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,460
Get out and never come back.

993
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,140
Maybe he should have yelled that...

994
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:24,900
Wait, okay, so what are the order of operations here?

995
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:26,160
Because...

996
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:28,780
Um, the man's leg was stuck.

997
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:48,500
did did did did duck run him over at the same time as the zombies come in he should have yelled you got that ride to make it if you want oh no you have to only pick one oh you can't save sean

998
01:11:52,360 --> 01:12:05,160
oh press x to sean i was thinking of two sure sure So Duck ran him over, and then he should have yelled, and we would have helped him, and then the zombies come.

999
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,440
This is as far as we're going.

1000
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:16,680
Like, like, I fear that Sean was not able to be, there was no saving him.

1001
01:12:21,180 --> 01:12:21,740
Drug.

1002
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:24,600
Jason.

1003
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:28,160
Look.

1004
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,840
Duck, you killed a man.

1005
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:32,040
Hey there.

1006
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:32,500
Oh, no.

1007
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,060
You friendly?

1008
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:33,680
No, no.

1009
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:34,780
Trucks run out of gas.

1010
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,000
I hate these people have no survival instincts.

1011
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,920
I think I'm going...

1012
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:39,680
Oh, gosh.

1013
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:40,620
Ah!

1014
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,200
Why would you yell?

1015
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:44,160
Why would you yell?

1016
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:45,500
Why would you yell?

1017
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:51,920
Sorry.

1018
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:53,340
I don't mean to laugh.

1019
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:54,420
It's just...

1020
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:55,880
Run!

1021
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:02,530
Yeah!

1022
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:10,450
We can't.

1023
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,750
We can't take risks like this.

1024
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:13,850
And we can't just let people die either.

1025
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,210
When I say that door stays shut no matter what, I fucking mean it.

1026
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:18,490
Oh.

1027
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:20,490
We don't know who these people are.

1028
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,890
They could be dangerous.

1029
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:22,670
Ah.

1030
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:25,190
They couldn't let them right to us.

1031
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:25,690
We have kids.

1032
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:27,050
Where the hell is your humanity?

1033
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,990
We have kids with us.

1034
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:29,350
Yeah.

1035
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:31,430
I see one little girl.

1036
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:33,870
I'm dead.

1037
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:34,970
What is it?

Sorry, Clementine.

1072
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:29,550
Clementine has plot armor.

1073
01:17:29,710 --> 01:17:30,470
She can't die.

1074
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:32,550
I don't know.

1075
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,610
Thank God for whatever it is.

1076
01:17:35,010 --> 01:17:36,970
Is Glenn like Glenn from the show?

1077
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,450

1078
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:41,390

1079
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:42,050
Dad!

1080
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:43,750

Was he the bitten, bud?

1082
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:51,800
Was he the one bitten?

1083
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,860
No, don't be crazy.

1084
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:54,800
It's his heart.

1085
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:55,660
My pills.

1086
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:57,680
Nitroglycerin pills?

1087
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Yes, we're out.

1088
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:01,580
We've been trying to get into the pharmacy since we got here.

1089
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,300
Please try to get in there.

1090
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:05,500
Behind the counter where the pills are.

1091
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,580
Well, why would I be able to?

1092
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,300
We'll do it somehow.

1093
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,100
We'll get in there somehow.

1094
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:12,560
Thank you so much.

1095
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:13,440
Bitten in his heart.

1096
01:18:14,060 --> 01:18:15,700
We need nitroglycerin pills.

1097
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:16,980
Please get in there.

1098
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:18,480
I'll keep an eye on my dad.

1099
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:21,120
Did you guys not go to the bathroom at all?

1100
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,580
How did you not know that there was a thing in there?

1101
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,060
I'm starting to think this drugstore isn't a permanent solution.

1102
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:27,000
You're right.

1103
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:28,820
This ain't exactly Fort Knox.

1104
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,060
What do you suggest?

1105
01:18:30,440 --> 01:18:34,040
We need as much gas as possible so we can all get out of downtown Macon.

1106
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:35,980
Oh, we're in Macon.

1107
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:37,560
Then I'll head out and get gas.

1108
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,820
There's a motel not too far from here.

1109
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,120
Out towards the end of Peachtree.

1110
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,380
I'll work my way towards it and then loop back siphoning what I can.

1111
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:45,660
They picked a P-corner.

01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:48,140

Yeah, I think so.

1167
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:18,980
Uh, being good is good, despite the circumstances.

1168
01:22:19,820 --> 01:22:20,160
Yep.

1169
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:21,120
Yep.

1170
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:22,800
We'll sit tight.

1171
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,280
Have you played telltale games before?

1172
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:33,660
Energy bar.

01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,880
It's not much, but here you go.

1181
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,420
There you go, a little energy bar.

1182
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,180
Of course.

1183
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,580
You took care of Clementine.

1184
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,060
Yes, I did.

1185
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,900
Wait, we can take more energy bars.

1186
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:58,430
This one's for me.

1187
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:04,650
Dental needs.

1188
01:23:06,430 --> 01:23:07,570
Shaving needs.

1189
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:11,090
I've never seen, like, a store that says hair needs.

1190
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:13,330
Like, it just usually says, like, hair.

1191
01:23:13,810 --> 01:23:14,370
You know.

1192
01:23:15,630 --> 01:23:16,050
Okay.

1193
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:17,510
Alive inside.

1194
01:23:18,350 --> 01:23:19,110
Oh, my gosh.

1195
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,270
Don't dead.

1196
01:23:21,490 --> 01:23:22,290
Open inside.

1197
01:23:24,190 --> 01:23:24,870
How's he doing?

1198
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:26,830
I'm not sure I got your name.

1199
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:27,990

1200
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:28,490

My dad's Larry.

1202
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:46,470
I was just doing what I had to earlier Everyone was Now his heart's acting up again And I'm powerless to do anything And that violence before A lot of good telltale games But didn't help What's wrong with him?

1203
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:47,750
What's wrong with him?

1204
01:23:47,890 --> 01:24:31,450
He's got a heart condition He takes nitroglycerin tablets pretty regularly I've seen a few bad attacks That he couldn't get over And needed to go to the hospital Yeah, that's not really an option right now I'm just trying to keep him relaxed between you and me doky-doby who do you think would turn into zombie first I can't I'm dead so good luck everybody else um what do you think about all this you're from here you're from here I work at Warner Robbins the Air Force base oh oh yeah he did mention that just mechanical admin stuff I deal with a bunch of shitheads and bureaucrats all day sometimes a plane if I'm lucky you I work up at UGA.

1205
01:24:32,730 --> 01:24:33,250
UGA.

1206
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:36,250
Uh, was anyone here when you guys got to the pharmacy?

1207
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:38,230
Was anyone here when you guys got here?

1208
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,050
No, this place was pretty wrecked.

1209
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:42,290
We pulled a couple of bodies out of the office.

1210
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:45,210
Are you okay?

1211
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:48,470
Yeah, I'm fine.

1212
01:24:49,490 --> 01:24:51,210
Did you know anybody here?

1213
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:51,930
Oh.

1214
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:55,510
Yeah, the owners, they were, uh, we were close.

1215
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:56,030
Oh!

1216
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:56,710
I'm sorry.

1217
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,950
We found an older couple in the office.

1218
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:02,390
them out in case they weren't really dead

1219
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:13,630
um yeah he's got a temper he's got a temper ah fuck you yeah he doesn't mean it it's just that

1220
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:36,170
we've got kids here families we've got kids here families he and i are a family i'm just saying some people can't handle a temper like that hell Well, he seems like you can't it's just his way don't make him the reason everything's screwed She's getting mad at me.

1221
01:25:36,170 --> 01:25:37,250
Oh, where's her mom?

1222
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:43,890
Savannah, I think oh You guys aren't together.

1223
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:45,950
Oh, no, I'm not her dad.

1224
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:48,610
Why is everybody so weird about like getting out of Atlanta?

1225
01:25:49,490 --> 01:25:55,670
She's been surviving by herself I think the girl's parents didn't make it.

1226
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:59,690
Oh Like it I heard an answering message They were in Savannah.

1227
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:01,430
She was home with a sitter.

1228
01:26:02,050 --> 01:26:03,170
It wasn't good.

1229
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,630
Stranger danger, maybe.

1230
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,890
She's lucky to have you.

1231
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:08,090
Is it strange in this kind of situation?

1232
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:11,890
I feel like everybody just kind of like finds each other.

1233
01:26:12,810 --> 01:26:15,950
I don't think it would be so strange to be like, yeah, I found a person on...

1234
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,470
Just kind of surviving.

1235
01:26:18,970 --> 01:26:20,630
In this kind of story.

1236
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:21,570
Hmm.

1237
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,250
But, you know.

1238
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:29,820
Kind of since it's...

1239
01:26:29,840 --> 01:27:26,220
recent i guess so i know everything went to so fast what do you think about all this what do you think about all this what is there to think the dead are up walking around eating people and turning them into more more of them yeah i mean jesus we need to stick together and get through this i never really understood i'm gonna get back to him sounds good never really and lee yeah it was a crazy situation and you froze before with that thing coming out of the bathroom oh yeah just don't beat yourself up over don't call me out we stick together and we'll be okay the dead are walking no like okay what I don't understand is like usually like okay is zombies in this case.

1240
01:27:29,340 --> 01:27:43,740
If, if, if, if something is, if something becomes a zombie, then, then, sit, like, I guess it depends on what.

1241
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:47,720
I don't know.

1242
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:48,940
I don't know.

1243
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:54,000
Like, what's the point of infecting other things?

1244
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:24,420
you don't eat the people to like consume you eat to is it just to spread but then yeah they hungry they're just hungry it's like a parasite that needs a host but then eventually and then also how long are the zombies supposed to live for i remember in the walking dead there were zombies that were like living for years.

1245
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,020
I mean, dead for years.

1246
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:27,720
Living dead for years.

1247
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,140
That's so confusing.

1248
01:28:31,860 --> 01:28:32,600
Anyway, okay.

1249
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,740
I don't understand how zombies work.

1250
01:28:37,620 --> 01:28:39,380
We can't let anything happen to Ducky.

1251
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:49,580
Ducky!

1252
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,820
Hey, Lee.

1253
01:28:52,480 --> 01:30:08,980
Maybe punching him wasn't such a good idea there were worse plans says the guy who didn't get punched in the mouth oh well it's your kid I don't appreciate your support thank you Lee how's duck doing wait this place has snow cones and Sundays oh and what is a specials specials how's duck doing it's okay it was just a shock we're lucky as hell nobody got nabbed on the way in here little kid how's she doing how much of the zombies eat you unless they eat your brains oh wait uh her family is wait who'd they ask about well her family's dead so that's awful lee oh yeah well she seems to be handling herself all right she's just a little girl okay lee says she spent days on her own that takes tough so it has been days no idea what sort of emotional damage is happening to her every second we slept in the car for days what's the plan what's the plan hang tight i suppose seems pretty dangerous out there so we ought to wait for things to clear up you said your family is from here in makin that's

1254
01:30:08,980 --> 01:30:52,060
right where are they should we go looking for them oh they own this place wait is that what he meant they uh owned this place they uh pulled some bodies out of the office before we got here oh no that's what he meant gone oh sweetie cat they were good people i wasn't around much but yeah they did that's so sad so he didn't tell them that it was his parents but it was his parents so sad are you guys all right we're just fine considering how about you duck All bad throughout.

1255
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,560
Lee, you got a second?

1256
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:59,400
Duck has... Duck...

1257
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:01,160
Duck has trauma in his eyes.

1258
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:02,240
Yeah.

1259
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:03,680
Yeah.

1260
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,080
We didn't even try to save him.

1261
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,940
That blood is on our hands, you know?

1262
01:31:10,460 --> 01:31:12,300
It happened pretty fast.

1263
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,200
It happened pretty fast, I guess.

1264
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,560
But I can't stop seeing him in my head.

1265
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,720
Oh, you're the one who ran away.

1266
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:19,620
We killed that boy.

1267
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:20,060
You?

1268
01:31:20,060 --> 01:31:20,980
We could have saved him.

1269
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,620
You ran away!

1270
01:31:23,780 --> 01:31:26,120
Why is he getting bad at me?

1271
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:34,140
You think you do when you look back on it, but in a moment, when things are really out of control, you don't have any choice.

1272
01:31:35,640 --> 01:31:36,120
I guess.

1273
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:38,100
Can he go back to Florida?

1274
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:39,200
Console?

1275
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:40,980
Try to let it go.

1276
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:45,380
Wee.

1277
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:46,600
Wee.

1278
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:48,740
I don't want this guy's loyalty, though.

1279
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:50,800
I don't think he is very loyal.

1280
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:59,700
Wait, what was that?

1281
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:07,720
The Walking Dead doesn't have zombie media, so it's new to them.

1282
01:32:07,820 --> 01:32:09,460
Oh, is he going to see his parents?

1283
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,440
That's so sad.

1284
01:32:16,670 --> 01:32:17,610
Wolf Among Us.

1285
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:22,130
That would be a good time since second season is potentially releasing soon.

1286
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:23,690
I'll look into it.

1287
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:25,330
I saw some other people talking about it too.

1288
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:26,010
I'll look into it.

1289
01:32:26,070 --> 01:32:26,510
Thank you.

1290
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:27,270
Thank you.

1291
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:45,270

1294
01:33:12,980 --> 01:33:14,120
Just a picture.

1295
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:15,920
Just a picture of whoever was here.

1296
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,460
I know who you are.

1297
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:17,620
Oh.

1298
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:19,620
You're Lee Everett.

1299
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:23,740
You're a professor at Athens who killed a state senator who was sleeping with your wife.

1300
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,240
This is your parents' store.

1301
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:31,300
Folks around town know the owner's son got himself a life sentence, but I'm a reporter for W-A-B-E in Atlanta.

1302
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,180
I paid attention to that trial.

1303
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,560
Maybe you're a murderer, but I don't really care.

1304
01:33:36,140 --> 01:33:37,860
Frankly, that's a skill that might come in handy.

1305
01:33:39,240 --> 01:34:15,680
Did you tell anyone out there who you were or that you were tied to this place it's the apocalypse who cares the world is ending out there who cares who I am yeah if you don't think people will find any reason to turn on you especially when the shit hits the fan you're insane whatever you seem like an okay guy and the last thing we need is drama out there you've got this little girl to take care of and look don't make me wrong on this I don't plan to good because if this lasts longer than a few days and you're a detriment to the group then we'd have a problem i'm not a detriment i'll just keep it to myself

1306
01:34:18,940 --> 01:34:30,540
we'll be nice thanks thanks don't worry about it whoa she likes me what if she fell for me during the trial

1307
01:34:34,020 --> 01:34:38,960
wait oh we're go legal go legal go legal

1308
01:34:42,620 --> 01:34:43,900
No, take it, take it.

1309
01:34:44,040 --> 01:34:44,420
There we go.

1310
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:54,120
That's not true, Mr. I think you definitely need stuff.

1311
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:56,940
My parents came in here hoping to survive.

1312
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:59,080
It looks like one of them was her.

1313
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:03,000
Trying to be a hero, maybe.

1314
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,820
Or protect her, at least.

1315
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:07,220
So sad.

1316
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:08,700
Look at the alley.

1317
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,340
Wait, is he gonna move this?

1318
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:11,140
Please say no.

1319
01:35:11,140 --> 01:35:12,500
This door leads to the back alley.

1320
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:15,660
I don't think we should do that.

1321
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:16,580
Oh, legal.

1322
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:17,520
Oh, legal.

1323
01:35:18,020 --> 01:35:18,400
Oh, legal.

1324
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:22,700
Trying to get to, like, a different...

1325
01:35:22,700 --> 01:35:23,380
Is there...

1326
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:23,600
Maybe?

1327
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:24,480
Move the pallet?

1328
01:35:33,040 --> 01:35:34,160
What's that?

1329
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,760
Oh, nice.

1330
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:39,660
What's that?

1331
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,460
This is my dad's cane.

1332
01:35:43,740 --> 01:35:43,920
Oh.

1333
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:46,000
He'd zip around here on it from time to time.

1334
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:47,580
Was he sick?

1335
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,060
I thought it was like a...

1336
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,000
I didn't think it was a can.

1337
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:51,760
I thought it was a...

1338
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:52,640
Like a ballot.

1339
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:55,240
This place better than any guard dog ever could.

1340
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,540
Plus, he knew how to make it look cool.

1341
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:58,960
Like you had.

1342
01:35:59,540 --> 01:35:59,820
No!

1343
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:01,440
My dad gave it to me.

1344
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:02,120
So cute!

1345
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:03,780
See, dads are smart like that.

1346
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,420
Carly just knew Lee was the favor.

1347
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,920
Yeah, exactly.

1348
01:36:10,540 --> 01:36:11,620
Door to pharmacy.

1349
01:36:12,240 --> 01:36:13,740
Wait, why is it blocked, though?

1350
01:36:13,940 --> 01:36:16,100
I oughta clear a path to opening that door.

1351
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:17,740
I think there's something in there.

1352
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,780
We gotta clear this door for when we find the keys.

1353
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,960
Well, then move it.

1354
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:25,560
Better get this door clear, huh?

1355
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,100
Can I help?

1356
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:29,900
She's so sweet!

1357
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:34,080
Sweet, sweet, clementa.

1358
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,700

01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:43,860
Yeah.

1361
01:36:45,020 --> 01:36:46,200
It's not good.

1362
01:36:46,580 --> 01:36:47,980

Do you play sports?

1365
01:37:21,740 --> 01:37:23,880
I play soccer, but I don't really like it.

1366
01:37:24,120 --> 01:37:24,560
Why not?

1367
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,100
I'm not crazy about it either.

1368
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:29,000
All right, a little further.

1369
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:32,120

Hole!

1371
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:36,460
I think there's something in there.

1372
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:36,640
I'm scared.

1373
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:38,100
Why don't you want to talk about your family?

1374
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:39,800
Do they like hate you?

1375
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:42,080
Um, because like I, um...

1376
01:37:42,860 --> 01:37:43,980
Because they're dead.

1377
01:37:47,080 --> 01:38:15,120

1378
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:15,760
Oh.

1379
01:38:15,900 --> 01:38:16,800
You didn't know.

1380
01:38:17,180 --> 01:38:17,400
Oh.

1381
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,260
I'm just sorry for being mean.

1382
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:20,060
Oh, no.

1383
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:20,880
Clever Tart.

1384
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:24,520
Look, my family's gone and I just wish things would have been different.

1385
01:38:25,220 --> 01:38:25,700
Yeah.

1386
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:30,220
He was a state senator.

1387
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,780
Let's not go crazy.

1388
01:38:35,180 --> 01:38:35,660
Okay.

1389
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:36,280
Oh, shoot.

1390
01:38:36,620 --> 01:38:38,440
I guess let's finish moving the desk.

1391
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,480
I didn't notice it had a timer.

1392
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,400
Sometimes they have timers and sometimes they don't.

1393
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:42,140
I'm so sorry.

1394
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:43,960
Okay.

1395
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,980
Let me just...

1396
01:38:48,260 --> 01:38:48,720
Are you okay?

1397
01:38:48,980 --> 01:38:50,020
I hurt my finger.

1398
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,080
Is it bleeding?

1399
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,260
A little.

1400
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:55,980
Hope there's no zombie blood on it.

1401
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:56,900
On the...

1402
01:38:56,900 --> 01:38:57,860
I'll find you a bandage.

1403
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:58,820
On the table.

1404
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:01,880
Bandage in here.

1405
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:04,700
Nothing.

1406
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,900
Wait, there's a bandage over here.

1407
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:16,760
Give to her.

1408
01:39:21,140 --> 01:39:22,720
My crap, story mode!

1409
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:24,520
That's a telltale.

1410
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:25,220
It hurt.

1411
01:39:25,620 --> 01:39:27,980
Oh, let's see if we can do something about it.

1412
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:29,320
That thing bled fast.

1413
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:34,180
Oh Let's get this cut covered up.

1414
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:34,960
Yes, please.

1415
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:36,500

1424
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:26,090

01:40:26,430 --> 01:40:27,550

01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:19,540
Okay.

1439
01:41:20,060 --> 01:41:21,160
Where could the key be?

1440
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:23,200
What am I missing?

1441
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:27,100

1446
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:37,700
You're not bad, right?

1447
01:41:38,360 --> 01:41:39,040
I...

1448
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:40,620
Why are you asking me that?

1449
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,820
That lady said you killed someone.

1450
01:41:43,420 --> 01:41:46,860
Was that because he was one of the things trying to eat you?

1451
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,120
It's complicated.

1452
01:41:51,700 --> 01:41:52,440
It's complicated.

1453
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:57,540
Sometimes things happen or you do things and you can't explain them.

1454
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,440
Let's, uh...

1455
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:08,020

01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:43,560

1458
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,000
She sounds like a reporter.

1459
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,520
She has like that reporter voice.

1460
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,680
The reporter accent.

1461
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:53,280
I'm looking for batteries for your radio.

1462
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:53,900

1463
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:55,320

1465
01:42:58,020 --> 01:42:58,340
Thanks.

1466
01:42:58,740 --> 01:42:59,780
I appreciate it.

1467
01:43:00,920 --> 01:43:02,300
Story of the century here, huh?

1468
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:04,060
Story of the century here, huh?

1469
01:43:04,240 --> 01:43:06,700
Yeah, and I've got shit for recording equipment.

1470
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:10,220
And from the looks of it, there isn't going to be any shortage of first-hand accounts.

1471
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:11,480
Unless everybody dies.

1472
01:43:11,600 --> 01:44:25,800

Hold on to this until we get Glenn back, okay?

1475
01:45:15,340 --> 01:45:16,580
I'll take good care of it.

1476
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:17,280
What do you think?

1477
01:45:17,660 --> 01:45:19,640
I think Doug's not great around zombies.

1478
01:45:20,320 --> 01:45:20,580
Why?

1479
01:45:20,860 --> 01:45:21,740
Doug is a hero.

1480
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,440
We know this.

1481
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:26,800
I'll take Carly and her dead eye down to the motor end, get Glenn, and get back here as fast as I can.

1482
01:45:27,100 --> 01:45:29,720
If that's what you want to do, somebody's got to.

1483
01:45:30,040 --> 01:45:30,220
Yeah.

1484
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:30,700
I'm in.

1485
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,360
Always avoiding using the word zombie.

1486
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,120
Doesn't sound too bad there right now.

1487
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,540
Let me know as soon as you want to head out.

1488
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:36,860
I guess because it sounds kind of cartoonish.

1489
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:41,000
Um, the key?

1490
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:50,420

Wait, did she put them in wrong?

1496

No!

1499
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,640
You fixed it.

1500
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,800
The estimated death toll continues to skyrocket.

1501
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:32,920
W-A-B-E argues you to stay indoors and avoid any contact with individuals you suspect may have been exposed the station is okay in the event of a full uh my my producer's telling me we have to get off here steve oh my god god god bless you all

1503
01:48:45,020 --> 01:48:45,460
There we go.

1504
01:48:48,180 --> 01:48:48,400
Oh, wait.

1505
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:49,480
I see an energy bar.

1506
01:48:50,060 --> 01:48:51,280
I'm just going to keep taking these.

1507
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:55,420
Yeah.

1508
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:09,360
And then we'll go get Glenn.

1509
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:11,080
Hopefully he's okay.

1510
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,620
Can I search the bed?

1511
01:49:17,300 --> 01:49:20,340
What are the odds the radio fixed just then?

1512
01:49:21,680 --> 01:49:23,960
I'm trying to be a hero, maybe.

1513
01:49:24,420 --> 01:49:25,720
I'll protect her at least.

1514
01:49:26,500 --> 01:49:27,700
Give one to Ducky.

1515
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:29,540
That kid doesn't need one.

1516
01:49:30,180 --> 01:49:30,620
Kids...

1517
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:32,140
I thought this was a safe.

1518
01:49:34,460 --> 01:49:36,480
Where can we find it?

1519
01:49:41,120 --> 01:49:41,560
Hmm.

1520
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:42,940
Hmm.

1521
01:49:45,300 --> 01:49:46,880
I really don't see anything else.

1522
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,020
Do you want a hint?

1523
01:49:53,240 --> 01:49:53,860
What are we looking for?

1524
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:56,680
We're looking for the key to the pharmacy.

1525
01:49:56,860 --> 01:49:58,060
I didn't want to go...

1526
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,600
I didn't want to get it until I...

1527
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,940
Or, like, go to Glenn until I got the key.

1528
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,520
because I'm not sure if I will be able to find it.

1529
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:06,560
Check with Doug.

1530
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:07,760
Wait, does he have it?

1531
01:50:08,120 --> 01:50:12,220
Wait, maybe he'll tell me where the people are, the bodies he took out.

1532
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:13,840
Oh, wait, Doug.

1533
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:16,700
Oh, maybe they moved them outside.

1534
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,300
My parents.

1535
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:22,200
Try to get some rest, Hunt.

1537
01:50:22,760 --> 01:50:25,240
How can I with those things out there?

1538
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:25,840
Doug.

1539
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:27,980
How are we doing?

1540
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:28,720
Good.

1541
01:50:29,140 --> 01:50:30,680
Want to go have a look around outside?

1542
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:31,320
Okay.

1543
01:50:31,640 --> 01:50:36,480
Look, he looks normal what do they mean like oh it looks like a basement dweller

1544
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:50,920
how are we supposed to get outside

1545
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:26,060
they just eat as far as i can tell that's all i care about yeah whatever's left comes back as one of them yeah and then you go bald like that lady I think it might be more than a couple days before all this gets sorted out oh my God a couple days that's that's real hopeful oh

1546
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:43,940
shut up I can use the remote oh maybe that's how we get out boarded up windows yeah that's a hasty fortification job over there Yeah, it didn't work.

1547
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:46,900
Dom, no, welcome back.

1548
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:47,920
Thank you.

1549
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:51,620
I was gonna...

1550
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,740
I can't reach that brick.

1551
01:51:53,140 --> 01:51:53,780
Oh, just kidding.

1552
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,060
I was gonna take it.

1553
01:51:55,980 --> 01:51:58,400
Did you guys try to get in there and get weapons?

1554
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:00,780
I did, but it was too risky.

1555
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,400
Then a bunch of guys showed up and they tried.

1556
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:05,120
And what happened?

1557
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:08,100
I think they're most of who you see wandering around out there.

1558
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:09,360
Oh, oh.

1559
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:19,300
I don't want to do it just yet, but...

1560
01:52:20,620 --> 01:52:21,740
Open the lock.

1561
01:52:21,940 --> 01:52:22,340
That's crazy.

1562
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:24,340
It's a combination lock.

1563
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,220
Ah, fuel!

1564
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:27,540
Okay.

1565
01:52:28,940 --> 01:52:32,140
Well, I don't see the keys out.

1566
01:52:32,220 --> 01:52:33,740
Where did they put the bodies?

1567
01:52:36,940 --> 01:52:39,580
That place is full of TVs and electronics.

1568
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:41,980
Should I do it?

1569
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,680
That place is full of TVs and electronics.

1570
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:48,440
I think it...

1571
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:48,920
There we go.

1572
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,660
Your favorite show is on.

1573
01:52:56,840 --> 01:52:58,400
You know what I could do?

1574
01:52:59,180 --> 01:52:59,640
What's that?

1575
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:01,360
Go, Doug.

1576
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:03,520
Go with your socks and your sandals.

1577
01:53:03,960 --> 01:53:04,660
It's universal.

1578
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:07,500
I could program it to work with those TVs across the street.

1579
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,440
Let's just hope the power is still on.

1580
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:10,440
Yeah.

1581
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,060
You can just do that?

1582
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:14,820
You can?

1583
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:16,560
I memorized all the codes when I was in AV.

1584
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:17,800
Let's try.

1585
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:20,680
He's hacking.

1586
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:21,920
Don't have your hand outside.

1587
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:25,100
Well fucking done, dog.

1588
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:25,700
Woo!

1589
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,840
Dog nonsense might save a life.

1590
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:29,960
Who's to say it already hasn't?

1591
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:32,120
Whoa!

1592
01:53:33,360 --> 01:53:34,840
That guy is so gnarly.

1593
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,880
I've got a few of them to take notice.

1594
01:53:38,160 --> 01:53:39,060
Hacker man!

1595
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:41,260
Oh, they don't care.

1596
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,040
Not enough.

1597
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:43,060
Aw, man.

1598
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:45,840
We tried.

1599
01:53:46,020 --> 01:53:46,660
We tried.

1600
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:53,100
AV Club for the win.

1601
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,120
Oh, yeah.

1602
01:53:55,380 --> 01:53:57,720
Any idea where the pharmacy keys might be?

1603
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:00,280
We searched high and low inside before you guys got here.

1604
01:54:00,660 --> 01:54:02,460
They weren't on the old couple we could have in the office.

1605
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:06,480
Are you okay?

1606
01:54:09,180 --> 01:54:13,120
If the keys aren't in the drugstore, you think they could be out of here?

1607
01:54:13,900 --> 01:54:18,300
We now live in a world where getting up and walking ways and actual possibilities.

1608
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:19,420
Right.

1609
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:24,840
How'd you end up here?

1610
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:25,960
How'd you end up here?

1611
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:28,340
I moved here to live with my uncle.

1612
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:30,760
He does tech stuff and it just made sense.

1613
01:54:31,420 --> 01:54:32,000
So you're local.

1614
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:34,280
You probably knew the owners of this place.

1615
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:35,560
No, not really.

1616
01:54:35,920 --> 01:54:38,460
I've only been here a couple months and I spend a lot of time.

1617
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:39,920
On the computer?

1618
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,720
No, just doing my own thing.

1619
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:44,740
Let a man live!

1620
01:54:47,340 --> 01:54:48,540
I grew up here.

1621
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:49,760
I grew up here.

1622
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:52,660
I've been trying to get home since the day it came back.

1623
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:55,940
So you probably knew the owners then?

1624
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,480
Uh, you could say that.

1625
01:54:57,940 --> 01:54:58,520
Good people.

1626
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:01,420
He was a V-Tuber.

1627
01:55:02,340 --> 01:55:03,740
Doug is the original V-Tuber.

1628
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:07,700
I was just about to say, imagine being that guy.

1629
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:08,400
Wait.

1630
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:10,280
Oh, no.

1631
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:12,880
Is that his brother?

1632
01:55:13,800 --> 01:55:18,810
Look at the one trapped over there.

1633
01:55:21,230 --> 01:55:22,170
Is that his brother?

1634
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:22,770
Your brother.

1635
01:55:27,650 --> 01:55:53,630
oh shit what do you know that guy yeah he could be a drugstore he could be a drugstore employee yeah yeah so you're saying he might have the pharmacy keys I think so oh my gosh that's scary he might have the pharmacy keys I don't know could be anybody you know they start rotting and get all cheetah up and shut

1636
01:55:58,110 --> 01:55:59,550
Oh my god!

1637
01:55:59,770 --> 01:56:00,950
Look at the uniform though.

1638
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:05,150
He could have worked at the drugstore and died with keys in his pocket.

1639
01:56:06,550 --> 01:56:10,570
It would take a lot of effort to make it safe enough to go out there and see if he has the keys.

1640
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:11,370
It would.

1641
01:56:11,790 --> 01:56:15,250
If we could somehow prove that he worked here, I think it'd be worth it.

1642
01:56:15,390 --> 01:56:16,650
I got the evidence.

1643
01:56:16,970 --> 01:56:17,970
I'll see what I can find.

1644
01:56:20,250 --> 01:56:21,390
I have the evidence.

1645
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:23,570
That guy over there has the keys.

1646
01:56:26,530 --> 01:56:47,570
sure i found this in the office favorite zombie movie the photo worked here the key is being on him is as good a bed as we can make yeah i agree just need to figure out how to get out there and get them you wouldn't need long right just a few seconds maybe there's a way to distract them and buy you

1647
01:56:55,290 --> 01:56:56,850
Maybe if we...

1648
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:58,230
I can't reach that brick.

1649
01:56:58,430 --> 01:56:59,670
I can't reach it.

1650
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,270
Man, that's a hasty fortification job over there.

1651
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:04,170
I was gonna say...

1652
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:04,910
Yeah, it didn't work.

1653
01:57:05,130 --> 01:57:09,270
Maybe like throwing the brick at the window?

1654
01:57:11,890 --> 01:57:12,370
Um...

1655
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:21,330
The cane?

1656
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:23,230
Oh, the cane to get the brick!

1657
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:24,490
Let's head back inside.

1658
01:57:24,570 --> 01:57:25,450
You're right, you're right.

1659
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:30,580
You're right, you're right.

1660
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:58,760
thinking everybody kiwi welcome to Babyship thank you yeah if you haven't seen ponti pool before it's not like your average zombie movie i recommend it very much it's uh quite cool that's the door to the pharmacy we should be able to find pills for larry in there

1661
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,380
Grab it.

1662
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:05,800
Grab the cane.

1663
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:06,600
Use the cane.

1664
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:07,760
Take the cane.

1665
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:08,500
Cane?

1666
01:58:08,920 --> 01:58:09,540
Cane.

1667
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,800
Take the cane.

1668
01:58:12,420 --> 01:58:13,040
Get the cane.

1669
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:15,120
Grab can.

1670
01:58:15,540 --> 01:58:15,820
Grab.

1671
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:17,340
Hand out.

1672
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:18,320
Touch can.

1673
01:58:20,360 --> 01:58:21,040
Can.

1674
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:22,640
Can.

1675
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:23,120
Can.

1676
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:24,360
Can.

1677
01:58:29,500 --> 01:58:31,860
You can't take the cane because I...

1678
01:58:31,860 --> 01:58:32,620
Oh my gosh.

1679
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:32,920
Wait.

1680
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,540
I got one guide or several guide.

1681
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:44,040
Okay, well, we definitely have to use something to get the brick.

1682
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:51,340
Open the...

1683
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:54,960
I mean, we could unlock it and get the brick and then...

1684
01:58:57,360 --> 01:58:58,320
I'm scared.

1685
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:01,260
Okay, let's just go.

1686
01:59:02,020 --> 01:59:03,100

1692
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,000
Or at least the sound of it.

1693
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:47,400
Yeah.

1694
02:00:47,500 --> 02:00:49,560
If they were louder, we might be able to clear the street.

1695
02:00:49,780 --> 02:00:53,180
That's why I want to take the brick and throw it and then...

1696
02:00:54,060 --> 02:00:54,980
Those TVs are on.

1697
02:00:55,380 --> 02:00:57,920
And I'm sure they're making a lot of noise behind that glass.

1698
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,440
Use the remote on it.

1699
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:01,440
Oh, on this, yeah.

1700
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,400
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

1701
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:04,480
Open sesame.

1702
02:01:05,140 --> 02:01:06,280
That won't work.

1703
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:07,460
That was cute.

1704
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:10,040
Just like the cover that's releasing tomorrow.

1705
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:11,580
I know, Don.

1706
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:17,200
Lee's brother.

1707
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:18,280
That's messed up.

1708
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,560
A few seconds of searching it.

1709
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,140
We'll know if he has a keys.

1710
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:23,000
That's so messed up.

1711
02:01:23,440 --> 02:01:24,640
His whole family is dead.

1712
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:29,530
Garbanzo beans.

1713
02:01:35,290 --> 02:01:36,990
There's so many of them.

1714
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:39,950
Let's head back inside.

1715
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:40,270
Okay.

1716
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:46,870
I think he can reach that brick.

1717
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,150
I think he's just being late.

1718
02:01:52,170 --> 02:01:53,210
I guess...

1719
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:55,610
I'm not quite sure what to do.

1720
02:01:56,890 --> 02:01:57,830
Grab the brick.

1721
02:01:58,030 --> 02:01:59,130
It won't levy!

1722
02:01:59,350 --> 02:02:01,290
He says that he can't reach it!

1723
02:02:08,920 --> 02:02:09,440
So...

1724
02:02:09,440 --> 02:02:12,980
Is there something that shows what the code is for the lock?

1725
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:20,020
There's also the door to the alley, but I don't think that would do us any good.

1726
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:23,980
Oh, wait.

1727
02:02:24,440 --> 02:02:26,320
Actually, we can't even look at that door anymore.

1728
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,600
And there's nothing in the...

1729
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:34,140
I don't think there's anything here at all.

1730
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:36,820
Wait, does this work now?

1731
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:38,460
No.

1732
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:39,540
That's what I figured.

1733
02:02:42,160 --> 02:02:43,380
Is there a book on the counter?

1734
02:02:43,680 --> 02:02:43,880
Nope.

1735
02:02:44,720 --> 02:02:45,800
Here's a first aid kit.

1736
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:00,100
I don't know if we get Glenn first or after.

1737
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:02,580
we open the pharmacy and all.

1738
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:04,300
Ice cream menu?

1739
02:03:04,400 --> 02:03:05,920
It's all melted now.

1740
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:10,100
I could give him...

1741
02:03:10,100 --> 02:03:11,040
No, he doesn't need...

1742
02:03:11,740 --> 02:03:13,000
He doesn't need anything.

1743
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:13,360
Oh, wait.

1744
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:14,640
Okay, there's more stuff to look at.

1745
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:15,280
Okay, good, good.

1746
02:03:15,720 --> 02:03:17,440
I don't remember them very well.

1747
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:18,080
Who?

1748
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:24,780
Okay.

1749
02:03:27,680 --> 02:03:28,640
Greeting cards.

1750
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,960
Is there anything here that would say the code?

1751
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:33,920
Oh, my family.

02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:55,280

02:04:48,410 --> 02:04:49,770
She knows, she knows.

1759
02:04:51,370 --> 02:04:52,070
Anything else?

1760
02:04:52,070 --> 02:04:55,370
Looks like nobody got a chance to donate anything before this all went down.

1761
02:04:56,450 --> 02:04:56,770
Anything?

1762
02:04:57,870 --> 02:04:58,390
ATM?

1763
02:04:58,930 --> 02:05:00,010
It's got numbers on it?

1764
02:05:00,110 --> 02:05:00,870
It's not damaged.

1765
02:05:01,610 --> 02:05:02,790
Glad this place didn't get looted.

1766
02:05:04,770 --> 02:05:05,790
Use the axe.

1767
02:05:06,010 --> 02:05:08,010
Where was an axe at?

1768
02:05:09,730 --> 02:05:10,290
Newspaper.

1769
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:12,470

1770
02:05:20,470 --> 02:06:02,490

1772
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:25,590
That was really loud.

1773
02:06:27,370 --> 02:06:30,010
Can we get out of here before any of these things notice us?

1774
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:32,150
I thought it would be more gameplay.

1775
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:32,990
Oh.

1776
02:06:33,110 --> 02:06:34,790
No way, we gotta go now.

1777
02:06:35,230 --> 02:06:35,250
Oh.

1778
02:06:35,570 --> 02:06:37,090
Listen, I was out here looking for gas.

1779
02:06:37,490 --> 02:06:41,170
And then, up there in the corner room, I heard crying coming from inside.

1780
02:06:41,590 --> 02:06:41,730
Oh.

1781
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:42,630
Who is it?

1782
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:43,530
It's a girl.

1783
02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:45,510
We talked and she got frightened.

1784
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:49,770
I was trying to get in and help her and she started yelling and saying I was bitten.

1785
02:06:49,990 --> 02:06:50,230
What?

1786
02:06:51,210 --> 02:08:22,610
I wasn't and that's when all these guys came out of the forest lost cause next and I ended up hiding in the ice machine lucky you now let's go we can't just leave her damn right we can you guys are suicidal over a girl I'm saving a girl how about you think about if it was you fine let's go save Glenn's damsel in distress oh la la oh my gosh being able to control the camera what's happening where am I oh my gosh oh that guy's licking the wall okay this is the plan you don't know how hard it's gonna be to get her out of that room you gotta get the female kill every one of them in here what not with the gun yeah quietly yeah yeah yeah okay with a knife over the wall oh man she's eating this oh so we got that one right there close okay all right that's kind of scary what is that a pillow and that is an rv okay and what's over here we've got a truck the girl's behind that door and the girl those two seem to be on the scent okay Pistol pillow.

1787
02:08:22,910 --> 02:08:27,210
It'll act as a suppressor.

1788
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:30,290
Okay.

1789
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:33,730
Um...

1790
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:34,470
What?

1791
02:08:34,610 --> 02:08:37,090
Oh, so Glenn gets to peek for a long time, but not me.

1792
02:08:38,970 --> 02:08:43,910
I think the truck might be a better option.

1793
02:08:44,770 --> 02:08:45,530
Where to next?

1794
02:08:45,790 --> 02:08:46,730
I think the truck.

1795
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:48,410
Let's go to the truck.

1796
02:08:51,350 --> 02:09:24,800
we can hide by that pickup yeah I think the truck shit happens oh my gosh okay oh my gosh let's examine we're gonna examine oh if I break it that's I need the pillow!

1797
02:09:25,440 --> 02:09:28,920
I think I found a pretty damn good way to stop these guys quietly.

1798
02:09:28,940 --> 02:09:29,640
We need the pillow!

1799
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:31,080
We just have to get it quietly.

1800
02:09:31,240 --> 02:09:32,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1801
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:33,360
Okay, back, back, back.

1802
02:09:33,980 --> 02:09:34,700
Nice, okay.

1803
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:36,540
So let's go...

1804
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:40,280
Um, look at brick wall.

1805
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:40,900
Oh, wait.

1806
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,640
This guy is so chill.

1807
02:09:50,660 --> 02:09:51,140
Okay.

1808
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:52,360
Nice.

1809
02:09:53,200 --> 02:09:53,980
She's cooking.

1810
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:58,460
Now grab the pillow.

1811
02:09:58,480 --> 02:09:58,860
pillow.

1812
02:10:00,660 --> 02:10:00,940
Take.

1813
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:03,920
Okay.

1814
02:10:04,040 --> 02:10:05,820
Good luck smothering them to death.

1815
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,000
That's not really what I have in mind.

1816
02:10:08,120 --> 02:10:08,320
Yeah.

1817
02:10:08,920 --> 02:10:09,860
Smart ass.

1818
02:10:12,820 --> 02:10:13,380
Okay.

1819
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:14,500
Run to the truck.

1820
02:10:22,790 --> 02:10:23,350
Okay.

1821
02:10:23,610 --> 02:10:24,790
Battery girl.

1822
02:10:27,610 --> 02:10:29,090
You tell him.

1823
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:35,160
I think I'm gonna have problems with that.

1824
02:10:35,900 --> 02:10:37,240
What are you gonna do with that?

1825
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:39,240
I don't really know.

1826
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,160
Do you have any tricks for getting into cars?

1827
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:44,300
Not without tools or making a bunch of noise.

1828
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:45,680
And none with pillows.

1829
02:10:47,460 --> 02:10:49,800
But if I... I guess though.

1830
02:10:50,020 --> 02:10:51,460
I use... Actually, wait a second.

1831
02:10:51,580 --> 02:10:56,580
When I thought of the pillow, I was thinking that it would shield my hand when I punched it.

1832
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:58,740
But it would still make a lot of noise, huh?

1833
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:02,540
Now that I think about it.

1834
02:11:05,160 --> 02:11:07,240
But I was like, oh yeah, it'll help my hand.

1835
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:14,260
The door handle has a prompt?

1836
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:16,700
Well dang.

1837
02:11:19,580 --> 02:11:20,740
Nice try though.

1838
02:11:20,780 --> 02:11:23,700
That one sitting down is just as dangerous as the others.

1839
02:11:24,200 --> 02:11:24,440
I know.

1840
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:27,260
I know everybody is dangerous.

1841
02:11:29,260 --> 02:11:31,040
But now, now we do have a pillow.

1842
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:33,440
Who is the guy kind of sitting down?

1843
02:11:33,540 --> 02:11:34,140
I want to look at him.

1844
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:35,780
Wait, can I smother him?

1845
02:11:37,260 --> 02:11:38,100
Alright, Beth.

1846
02:11:38,380 --> 02:11:40,520
If it went for that fellow lurking near the front.

1847
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,420
Oh, he's nasty.

1848
02:11:43,140 --> 02:11:44,700
I'm gonna smother him.

1849
02:11:45,140 --> 02:11:45,920
Get out your gun.

1850
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:46,760
What the noise?

1851
02:11:47,060 --> 02:11:47,960
Just follow my lead.

1852
02:11:48,060 --> 02:11:48,820
Wait, is this gonna work?

1853
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:50,800
I don't think this is gonna work.

1854
02:11:56,270 --> 02:11:57,750
That was sick.

1855
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:01,570
What was that?

1856
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:03,270
Just the wind.

1857
02:12:05,090 --> 02:12:05,890
Oh, dang!

1858
02:12:07,530 --> 02:12:09,750
Wait, the pillow really is a suppressor!

1859
02:12:17,860 --> 02:12:23,240
Look at that guy.

1860
02:12:24,220 --> 02:12:24,840
Wait, there's the...

1861
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:26,680
Is that the axe you guys are talking about?

1862
02:12:26,960 --> 02:12:27,420
Huh, huh?

1863
02:12:28,280 --> 02:12:31,460
I prefer cover that can't just roll away.

1864
02:12:33,300 --> 02:12:35,040
What if we open the door?

1865
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:37,460
What's the point?

1866
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:42,460
Spark plug.

1867
02:12:44,980 --> 02:12:45,500
Okay.

1868
02:12:46,300 --> 02:12:49,440
I don't know what we'll need this for, but...

1869
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,460
Because the pillow is a perfect silencer.

1870
02:12:53,060 --> 02:12:55,060
I'm suspending my belief.

1871
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:00,800
See, I feel...

1872
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,560
Wait, so...

1873
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:04,020
Honestly!

1874
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:07,100
Oh my gosh.

1875
02:13:07,300 --> 02:13:09,700
They really want to get into that room.

1876
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:12,960
They really want to get into that room.

1877
02:13:13,460 --> 02:13:22,420
punching the window with with the pillow seems just as realistic as using the pillow as a suppressor honestly

1878
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:33,460
um what will this do is this gonna make the car move because then we'll be exposed and I um

1879
02:13:37,660 --> 02:13:43,120
honestly I think your idea is better thank you I felt like I was cooking

1880
02:13:46,840 --> 02:13:48,540
Just do it?

1881
02:13:56,080 --> 02:13:59,300
The spark plug.

1882
02:14:00,200 --> 02:14:01,580
You should hold on there.

1883
02:14:01,940 --> 02:14:02,780
Good coming to hand you.

1884
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:03,740
Yeah.

1885
02:14:04,360 --> 02:14:05,840
So now we push the car?

1886
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,280
Where are we pushing?

1887
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,140
Where are we dropping, boys?

1888
02:14:14,780 --> 02:14:16,520
Oh, we're gonna...

1889
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:17,200
Oh my gosh.

1890
02:14:18,320 --> 02:14:18,920
Uh...

1891
02:14:20,600 --> 02:14:21,440
Okay.

1892
02:14:23,200 --> 02:14:25,360
It was awesome.

1893
02:14:27,880 --> 02:14:30,540
This sucks for that guy.

1894
02:14:32,920 --> 02:14:33,440
Okay.

1895
02:14:36,080 --> 02:14:38,580
A Leon would be helpful right now.

1896
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,460
My goodness, you're so right.

1897
02:14:45,540 --> 02:14:45,960
Okay.

1898
02:14:47,940 --> 02:14:48,780
Well...

1899
02:14:51,200 --> 02:14:52,720
There's a pig in the head.

1900
02:14:52,740 --> 02:15:10,380
truck yeah but how do i get it now let's clear out the area around the rv oh by the rv let's get the ones over there head upstairs and get out of you okay let's go back there

1901
02:15:14,630 --> 02:15:54,250
was nothing else though no i think we could oh wait we could run to the rv we can hide by that rv if we're quiet and keep yeah he's got his back this he's looking that way so I think we could run over there and now this guy won't see us because he's pinned or rather he will but he can't get us so we might we might be able to get him I think let's try it's safe so if I die I die running running running running quiet quiet Quiet,

1902
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:54,910
quiet.

1903
02:15:57,170 --> 02:15:57,610
Okay.

1904
02:15:58,290 --> 02:16:02,270
We're a little naked out here, except for Connie's gone and we can't use that much.

1905
02:16:02,410 --> 02:16:03,230
I know, I know.

1906
02:16:04,690 --> 02:16:05,430
Oh my gosh!

1907
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:06,910
Okay, just kidding.

1908
02:16:07,670 --> 02:16:10,770
Um, let's go back home.

1909
02:16:11,450 --> 02:16:14,270
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running.

1910
02:16:17,610 --> 02:16:21,030
Let's uh, I didn't try to look at the car again, so let's do that.

1911
02:16:21,450 --> 02:16:23,910
Running, running, running, running, running, running, running, running.

1912
02:16:24,030 --> 02:16:46,930
thing now that I have the spark plug which I don't think it's gonna change anything but let's just see oh wait no way wait let me see the spark plug let me see the spark plug of course I'm inside these things turns car windows to tissue

1913
02:17:00,630 --> 02:17:01,150
Okay.

1914
02:17:02,390 --> 02:17:03,430
It wasn't...

1915
02:17:03,430 --> 02:17:05,790
It wasn't...

1916
02:17:10,820 --> 02:17:11,340
Okay.

1917
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:12,840
That could scramble a brain pretty good.

1918
02:17:12,900 --> 02:17:13,380
It can.

1919
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:15,460
It can, it can.

1920
02:17:16,080 --> 02:17:16,620
All right.

1921
02:17:18,980 --> 02:17:19,840
All right.

1922
02:17:19,980 --> 02:17:21,940
Back over here.

1923
02:17:27,080 --> 02:17:28,380
Must have been the win.

1924
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:29,820
These guys have probably...

1925
02:17:29,820 --> 02:17:34,040
These zombies probably have an IQ of like 180 or something.

1926
02:17:34,180 --> 02:17:39,660
know all right get him

1927
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:50,560
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah

1928
02:17:56,700 --> 02:18:00,040
why would you do that

1929
02:18:04,380 --> 02:18:17,880
why did you do that wait aim for the head okay nice hey Oh, this is a big guy.

1930
02:18:18,180 --> 02:18:19,180
Oh, he's got no arm.

1931
02:18:28,660 --> 02:18:30,060
Dude, where'd your weapon go?

1932
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:32,880
Oh, my gosh.

1933
02:18:33,800 --> 02:18:34,480
It's cool.

1934
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:35,720
Now we've got this.

1935
02:18:36,780 --> 02:18:37,600
Are you two done?

1936
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:39,220
Yeah, I think we should stop.

1937
02:18:39,480 --> 02:18:40,720
You know, I think this is two.

1938
02:18:43,020 --> 02:18:45,740
I think someone else should grab the ice pit.

1939
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,720
I think someone else should grab it.

1940
02:18:49,740 --> 02:19:14,980

Okay, I'm not doing any of that.

1942
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:22,340
He's walking all on his own.

1943
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:24,160
Oh, my gosh.

1944
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:27,520

02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:52,500
You can't be serious.

1970
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,180
You made a difficult choice.

1971
02:21:54,520 --> 02:21:55,080

02:22:00,660 --> 02:22:02,240
There's no happy ending to this.

02:22:02,360 --> 02:22:02,720
Yeah.

1977
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:03,700

I think she could have at least got inside.

1987
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:01,480
Shut the door.

1988
02:23:03,960 --> 02:23:04,560

He won't survive any more stress.

1994
02:23:33,980 --> 02:23:36,980
The next order of business is getting those pills out of the pharmacy.

1995
02:23:37,280 --> 02:24:08,140
Yep You were a machine I was basically a robot even to that lady like just just put her what's the point you know you gotta say you're wasting a bullet but that to me is is i would have had to use it anyway on a zombie i saved a future zombie suddenly she yells persona where's the door wait i'm lost clementine you okay

I'm going to give you some of my food.

2001
02:24:21,170 --> 02:24:22,010
Don't tell the others.

2002
02:24:22,170 --> 02:24:23,110
I've found some snacks.

2003
02:24:23,490 --> 02:24:24,010
I'm cool.

2004
02:24:24,490 --> 02:24:25,470
Not much of an appetite.

2005
02:24:26,190 --> 02:24:27,410
Maybe save it for one of the kids.

2006
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:29,890
How are you doing, Glenn?

2007
02:24:30,470 --> 02:24:31,810
Not your board, kidder.

2008
02:24:32,850 --> 02:24:34,850
Do you know the combination to the lock?

2009
02:24:34,850 --> 02:24:37,290
Do you know the combination for the lock on the gate outside?

2010
02:24:37,990 --> 02:24:38,410
Why?

2011
02:24:38,830 --> 02:24:39,270
Why?

2012
02:24:39,270 --> 02:24:40,010
Oh, you know.

2013
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:41,790
I thought I'd go stretch my legs.

2014
02:24:43,990 --> 02:25:13,310

Mercy.

2016
02:25:16,430 --> 02:25:16,790
Mercy, man.

2017
02:25:17,390 --> 02:25:18,830
I couldn't let her go on like that.

2018
02:25:19,190 --> 02:25:19,190
Yeah.

2019
02:25:19,330 --> 02:25:20,150
We couldn't.

2020
02:25:20,390 --> 02:25:21,110
You never know.

2021
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:22,750
You can't give up hope.

2022
02:25:23,210 --> 02:25:24,830
I think it was over for, Glenn.

2023
02:25:26,970 --> 02:25:28,430
Uh-oh, they're mad at me.

2024
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:30,710
I'm being realistic here.

2025
02:25:33,330 --> 02:25:35,210
I'm being realistic!

2026
02:25:36,930 --> 02:25:39,470
You have to be in this situation.

2027
02:25:40,550 --> 02:25:41,790
What a simp.

2028
02:25:42,090 --> 02:25:46,390
He's just mad that his future girlfriend is dead now.

2029
02:25:46,730 --> 02:25:47,570
What's your next move?

2030
02:25:47,790 --> 02:25:48,150
I don't know.

2031
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:50,090
I mean, you guys seem okay.

2032
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:51,390
What about your family?

2033
02:25:52,010 --> 02:25:52,350
Yeah.

2034
02:25:53,610 --> 02:25:54,090
I...

2035
02:25:54,090 --> 02:25:55,550
I... Forget it, man.

2036
02:25:55,810 --> 02:25:56,830
That's your business.

2037
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:59,110
I hate feeling like I can't do anything.

2038
02:25:59,790 --> 02:26:01,010
I know the feeling, man.

2039
02:26:02,570 --> 02:26:03,050
Hey.

2040
02:26:03,050 --> 02:26:03,930
Try to get some rest.

2041
02:26:03,990 --> 02:26:04,470
Hey, Glenn.

2042
02:26:05,350 --> 02:26:06,010
Yeah, right.

2043
02:26:06,150 --> 02:26:08,410
Have you looked at Carly?

2044
02:26:09,250 --> 02:26:11,610
What about this girl here?

2045
02:26:11,710 --> 02:26:12,530
I don't remember her name.

2046
02:26:15,490 --> 02:26:28,170

02:26:49,280 --> 02:26:50,780

2049
02:26:55,180 --> 02:26:56,980
Well, can I say I didn't try?

2050
02:26:58,460 --> 02:26:59,020
You guys okay?

2051
02:26:59,400 --> 02:26:59,900
Oh, we do.

2052
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:04,580
If you don't mind, I think my family and I are going to rest for a bit.

2053
02:27:05,140 --> 02:27:07,820
Let me know if that asshole over there takes a turn for the worse.

2054
02:27:08,360 --> 02:27:09,440
You got it.

2055
02:27:10,540 --> 02:27:11,980
Do you guys want a snack?

2056
02:27:12,420 --> 02:27:14,520
I'm only sharing it with cool people.

2057
02:27:15,560 --> 02:27:16,900
It's not much but here.

2058
02:27:17,360 --> 02:27:17,880

2059
02:27:18,440 --> 02:27:18,500
For the boy.

2060
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:19,280
Thanks, Lee.

2061
02:27:19,660 --> 02:27:20,640
He appreciates it.

2062
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:23,120
Not sweet, Lee.

2063
02:27:25,260 --> 02:27:26,420
Don't share it with Ducky.

2064
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:31,600
How are we doing?

2065
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:32,280
Good.

2066
02:27:32,880 --> 02:27:34,300
Want to go have a look around outside?

2067
02:27:36,200 --> 02:27:37,340
Let's have a look around.

2068
02:27:37,900 --> 02:27:38,000
Okay.

2069
02:27:38,280 --> 02:27:41,260
Doug seems a little too eager to go look around outside.

2070
02:27:41,440 --> 02:27:41,800
You know what?

2071
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:48,620
He seems a little like, hey, hey, you want to go look around outside?

Oh, no, not that...

2080
02:29:18,520 --> 02:29:21,920
One of those axes with the suppressor.

2081
02:29:23,100 --> 02:29:24,280
All right, Ikiimasu!

2082
02:29:25,700 --> 02:29:26,840
Okay, Doug, get out of the way.

2084
02:30:00,140 --> 02:30:03,140
I know if you were there, I would have died for you.

2085
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:07,760
So yeah, I'm gonna assume that's what happened.

2086
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:08,460
Okay.

2087
02:30:08,920 --> 02:30:09,860
Did you find them yet?

2088
02:30:10,460 --> 02:30:11,320
Give me a second.

2089
02:30:11,700 --> 02:30:13,860
Oh, well, yeah, no, I'm with Doug here.

2090
02:30:14,060 --> 02:30:15,160
Can we not yell also?

2091
02:30:17,720 --> 02:30:19,280
I have to finish you off now.

2092
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:20,640
I got to do this now, man.

2093
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:22,360
I got to do this.

2094
02:30:22,560 --> 02:30:23,760
I'm cold-blooded, I think.

2095
02:30:25,020 --> 02:30:26,740
Not even letting him have his peace.

2096
02:30:41,480 --> 02:30:42,360
Just realistic.

2097
02:30:46,480 --> 02:30:47,300
It's scary.

2098
02:30:50,060 --> 02:30:51,120
Oh my god.

2099
02:30:51,340 --> 02:30:52,400
Go for the head, man.

2100
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:53,180
Go for the head.

2101
02:30:53,260 --> 02:30:53,440
Nothing.

2102
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:04,200
There you go.

2103
02:31:04,560 --> 02:31:05,120
There you go.

2104
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:07,480
It keeps...

2105
02:31:07,480 --> 02:31:09,840
Yeah, he kept aiming for the neck for some reason.

2106
02:31:12,840 --> 02:31:13,900
Or was that mean?

2107
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:15,240
Is it because I was clicking this?

2108
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:16,940
Uh, was that me?

2109
02:31:17,220 --> 02:31:19,100
I thought that I had to click this.

2110
02:31:19,180 --> 02:31:20,760
Oh, well.

2111
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:24,180
Yeah, I got an achievement.

2112
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:27,100
I didn't read what it said, so...

2113
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,520
Scripted aiming.

2114
02:31:32,510 --> 02:31:33,290
Holy crap!

2115
02:31:34,110 --> 02:31:34,510
Run!

2116
02:31:38,300 --> 02:31:38,700
Wait!

2117
02:31:39,700 --> 02:31:41,680
Um, I think that was you, Douglas.

2118
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:47,640
Oh, we have nothing to...

2119
02:31:47,640 --> 02:31:48,400
Oh, my gosh.

2120
02:31:50,300 --> 02:31:50,880
Just keep...

2121
02:31:50,900 --> 02:31:51,420
it locked.

2122
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:53,520
Maybe like a plank.

2123
02:31:53,700 --> 02:31:54,580
Man that was close.

2124
02:31:55,780 --> 02:31:56,540
But we did it.

2125
02:31:57,060 --> 02:31:57,620
It's all that meant.

2126
02:31:57,660 --> 02:31:59,820
Maybe like a plank on the door or something, you know.

2127
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:01,120
Oh my gosh, Douglas, please.

2128
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:02,340
Dougie.

2129
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:02,800
Doug.

2130
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:03,300
Doug.

2131
02:32:03,660 --> 02:32:03,900
Doug.

2132
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:04,600
Doug.

2133
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:06,100
Great.

2134
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:08,020
God, you're amazing.

2135
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:10,040
Let's have one and more swings.

2136
02:32:10,620 --> 02:32:11,060
Oh yeah.

2137
02:32:11,320 --> 02:32:12,820
Please barricade the door.

2138
02:32:13,540 --> 02:32:15,020
Please barricade the door.

2139
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:17,040
Please, please, please, please, please.

2140
02:32:18,700 --> 02:32:20,240
That's the door to the pharmacy.

2141
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:20,800
Yeah, yeah.

2142
02:32:20,900 --> 02:32:23,300
We should be able to find tools for Larry in there.

2143
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:24,680
Oh, thank you for the redirect!

2144
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:25,920
Hello, welcome, welcome.

2145
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:27,240
Yeah, I had the key.

2146
02:32:27,400 --> 02:32:28,140
There you go.

2147
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:28,920
I had it highlighted.

2148
02:32:32,460 --> 02:32:32,860
Okay.

2149
02:32:33,960 --> 02:32:34,840
There we go.

2150
02:32:36,260 --> 02:32:37,060
Oh, no.

2151
02:32:37,700 --> 02:32:38,000
Shit.

2152
02:32:38,400 --> 02:32:39,560
Oh, this is so...

2153
02:32:39,560 --> 02:32:40,200
Left for dead.

2154
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:45,680
This is...

2155
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:45,840
Oh.

2156
02:32:51,230 --> 02:32:52,010
Why is this...

2157
02:32:52,010 --> 02:32:53,970
Does the alarm automatically go off?

2158
02:32:55,270 --> 02:32:57,170
I opened it properly, no?

2159
02:33:03,310 --> 02:33:04,250
With the key!

2160
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:17,200
Come

2161
02:33:22,120 --> 02:33:23,180

2162
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:25,180
I'm gonna get the truck pulled up round back!

Okay.

2184
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:36,400
Can you look for something to stick in between the handles?

2185
02:34:36,720 --> 02:34:38,300
Something really wrong, okay?

2186
02:34:39,380 --> 02:34:48,860
Clementine, you know what to get You know what to get Nothing Oh

2188
02:35:13,020 --> 02:35:13,540
No!

2189
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:19,080
Oh, do we have to choose who to save?

2190
02:35:20,980 --> 02:35:21,620
Uh-oh.

2191
02:35:22,940 --> 02:35:23,500
Oh, no.

2192
02:35:24,260 --> 02:35:24,440
Wait.

2193
02:35:29,500 --> 02:35:31,700
Save Doug or Carly.

2194
02:35:32,280 --> 02:35:33,460
Oh, wait, who's who?

2195
02:35:33,940 --> 02:35:34,780
Oh, this is Doug.

2196
02:35:35,460 --> 02:35:36,300
This is Carly.

2197
02:35:36,960 --> 02:35:38,480
Um, I don't know who to save.

2198
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:44,700
I think Doug would have wanted me to save Carly.

2199
02:35:45,800 --> 02:35:47,880
She also has really good AM.

2200
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:56,670
Okay, it was like a death flag though.

2201
02:35:56,970 --> 02:36:01,870
When Doug said that we'll make it or that, you know, he was like, if we make it out of it, you know, it was...

2202
02:36:01,870 --> 02:36:02,470
You got Doug.

2203
02:36:04,850 --> 02:36:09,470
Get out of her neck

2204
02:36:14,960 --> 02:36:15,840
and then stab her.

2205
02:36:16,940 --> 02:36:17,940
Oh, I'm running, I'm running.

2206
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:21,920
Not covered with this, you son of a bitch.

2207
02:36:22,300 --> 02:36:22,640
No!

2208
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:25,460
No way!

2209
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:27,120
No way!

2210
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:30,680
Wait, what am I supposed to do here?

2211
02:36:33,240 --> 02:36:35,420
I'm not letting somebody else get eaten today.

2212
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:36,240
Can't eat!

2213
02:36:36,940 --> 02:36:38,300
I'm especially a good friend.

2214
02:36:38,800 --> 02:36:39,160
Ah!

2215
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:42,920
I should...

2216
02:36:44,580 --> 02:36:45,220
I...

2217
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:47,600
We got that man's pills!

2218
02:36:49,440 --> 02:36:51,580
I think this is how he repays us?

2219
02:36:57,420 --> 02:36:59,260
You let Dennis die.

2220
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:01,260
You don't even know his name.

2221
02:37:08,490 --> 02:37:08,910
Chugged.

2222
02:37:09,710 --> 02:37:15,210
Oh, my God.

2223
02:37:18,010 --> 02:37:18,850
Oh, man.

2224
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:21,330
That was so awesome.

2225
02:37:22,390 --> 02:37:25,990
This is that ducky saying, Oh, Clementine, it was so awesome with the zombies.

2226
02:37:26,370 --> 02:37:26,830
No way.

2227
02:37:26,910 --> 02:37:28,210
It's a good thing we killed that girl, huh?

2228
02:37:28,230 --> 02:37:30,030
or else she would have been hiding in that room.

2229
02:37:31,810 --> 02:37:32,210
Yeah.

2230
02:37:34,890 --> 02:37:36,470
I've gotten the manless pills.

2231
02:37:36,870 --> 02:37:37,410
For real.

2232
02:37:40,030 --> 02:37:41,510
What a real loser.

2233
02:37:42,050 --> 02:37:42,950
Is that him screaming?

2234
02:37:43,110 --> 02:37:43,710
I hope so.

2235
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:50,760
Oh no, that's her.

2236
02:37:51,940 --> 02:37:53,640
I'm gonna... I'm about to... I'm...

2237
02:37:54,160 --> 02:37:54,960
Hey, Glenn.

2238
02:37:57,240 --> 02:37:57,380
Oh.

2239
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:01,320
Georgia's cities and their current level of disaster are as follows.

2240
02:38:02,140 --> 02:38:04,260
Atlanta, stage 9 catastrophe.

2241
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:06,800
Augusta, stage 9 catastrophe.

2242
02:38:07,620 --> 02:38:07,820
Huh?

2243
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:09,280
To Atlanta.

2244
02:38:09,580 --> 02:38:09,800
Yeah.

2245
02:38:10,220 --> 02:38:11,100
I got friends there.

2246
02:38:11,780 --> 02:38:14,800
And I just can't stay here knowing that they could be trapped in that city.

2247
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:17,560
Did you just not hear that they said stage 9 catastrophe?

2248
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:20,460
When we left a few days ago, could have gone either way.

2249
02:38:20,620 --> 02:38:21,700
I gotta take my chances.

2250
02:38:21,880 --> 02:38:22,660
Wait, Glenn, no!

2251
02:38:23,460 --> 02:38:24,400
Is it a girl?

2252
02:38:28,480 --> 02:38:29,820
He's going on TV.

2253
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:31,760
So what is Glenn from the show?

2254
02:38:32,360 --> 02:38:34,080
He's got to go back to TV.

2255
02:38:34,520 --> 02:38:34,920
Glenn, no!

2256
02:38:35,180 --> 02:38:35,540
TV!

2257
02:38:38,420 --> 02:38:39,860
He has to...

2258
02:38:39,860 --> 02:38:43,480
He has to go off and then get got by Negan.

2259
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:47,240
I think that's the wrong call.

2260
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:52,540
Yeah, actually, if we keep him with us, Glenn, Glenn, you won't live.

2261
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:53,880
I've seen the future.

2262
02:38:56,040 --> 02:38:57,680
Glenn, I've seen the future.

2263
02:38:58,320 --> 02:38:59,740
Don't go to Atlanta.

2264
02:39:00,440 --> 02:39:01,880
Don't go to Atlanta.

2265
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:04,960
Glenn,

2266
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:11,080
Glenn, the ratings are going to tank.

2267
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:15,420
Glenn, the show will be ruined.

2268
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:17,120
Nobody will watch it anymore.

2269
02:39:20,740 --> 02:39:22,740
Don't try to change the future.

2270
02:39:23,940 --> 02:39:24,540
Oh.

2271
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:31,160
You won't live here either.

2272
02:39:32,100 --> 02:39:33,260
No, I believe in us.

2273
02:39:34,080 --> 02:39:36,020
You gotta do what you gotta do.

2274
02:39:37,160 --> 02:39:37,600
What was it?

2275
02:39:37,700 --> 02:39:41,200
What is a baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.

2276
02:39:42,660 --> 02:39:44,380
Come with us if you want to live.

2277
02:39:44,940 --> 02:39:46,560
You gotta do what you gotta do.

2278
02:39:47,020 --> 02:39:48,000
And I gotta do this.

2279
02:39:48,440 --> 02:39:49,340
I respect that.

2280
02:39:49,440 --> 02:39:50,260
You guys be safe.

2281
02:39:50,700 --> 02:39:51,360
We'll try.

2282
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:55,580
And Lee, you know, if this doesn't get better, people are going to give up.

2283
02:39:55,640 --> 02:39:56,640
There's no spin-off for you.

2284
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:57,340
If they go from upstairs.

2285
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,080
Your actions have created a ton of power dogs.

2286
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:02,460
You told Carly to give her the gun.

2287
02:40:03,660 --> 02:40:13,060
dude maybe you were right i don't know how to handle something like that he's still so but heard about that see you around see you on tv

2288
02:40:16,760 --> 02:40:23,980
blend oh that guy is over there oh that guy is over there

2289
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:39,480

2290
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:48,100

2291
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:48,540
Hey, Kim.

2292
02:40:49,800 --> 02:40:50,780
Close call back there.

2293
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:52,360
Thanks for picking me up.

2294
02:40:52,700 --> 02:40:53,120
No problem.

2295
02:40:53,680 --> 02:40:55,080
We have to take care of each other.

2296
02:40:55,440 --> 02:40:55,720
Yeah.

2297
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:56,720
We do.

2298
02:40:57,500 --> 02:41:02,780
Earlier, I mentioned you got to ask yourself what you're going to do if Clementine's parents don't show.

2299
02:41:03,140 --> 02:41:04,140
Yeah, you did.

2300
02:41:04,600 --> 02:41:05,720
You think that's going to happen?

2301
02:41:06,260 --> 02:41:07,280
Her parents showing up?

2302
02:41:07,740 --> 02:41:09,240
No, I don't.

2303
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:11,560
Well, I want you to know that I think you've got it in you.

2304
02:41:12,020 --> 02:41:14,200
I think you can take care of that little girl just fine.

2305
02:41:14,420 --> 02:41:14,860
Oh!

2306
02:41:15,240 --> 02:41:15,860

You better have anyway, I'd rather be alone.

2310
02:42:05,710 --> 02:42:09,650
I think you you insulted him Was she being too dead eh?

2311
02:42:09,850 --> 02:42:14,350
Wait, Lee What is it?

2312
02:42:15,390 --> 02:42:16,590
How did you choose?

2313
02:42:17,490 --> 02:42:24,590
We both needed you you picked me I was going to help you both.

2314
02:42:25,190 --> 02:42:26,470
I was going to help you both.

2315
02:42:27,070 --> 02:42:28,230
But you helped me first.

2316
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:28,910
Oh.

2317
02:42:29,210 --> 02:42:30,350
Yeah, I did.

2318
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:31,410
You're a sharpshooter.

2319
02:42:31,530 --> 02:42:33,030
I just wish we both could have made it, you know?

2320
02:42:33,810 --> 02:42:34,810
Me too, Carly.

2321
02:42:35,650 --> 02:42:37,350
I like that you have a small brain.

2322
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:38,910
What are you tinkering with there, girl?

2323
02:42:39,350 --> 02:42:41,070
I don't think you...

2324
02:42:41,070 --> 02:42:42,610
Oh, she's going through supplies.

2325
02:42:43,570 --> 02:42:44,170
Oh, my God.

2326
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:45,850
Let's go save Clementine finally.

2327
02:42:46,090 --> 02:42:47,370
This poor girl.

2328
02:42:52,660 --> 02:42:53,720

I know I need to be tough.

2331
02:43:26,840 --> 02:43:27,740
I'm just sad.

2332
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:28,380
We're walking!

2333
02:43:28,380 --> 02:43:29,960
I know it doesn't make any sense.

2334
02:43:30,360 --> 02:43:32,600
But it's how I used to talk to my mom and dad.

2335
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:34,320
And now they're gone.

2336
02:43:34,840 --> 02:43:35,420
It's gone.

2337
02:43:35,940 --> 02:43:37,540
Maybe we can find you another one.

2338
02:43:37,760 --> 02:43:38,140
Yeah.

2339
02:43:38,500 --> 02:43:40,440
I'll just keep this one, I guess.

2340
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:41,880
We can fix it.

2341
02:43:41,920 --> 02:43:42,520
We can...

2342
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:43,300
Come here for a second.

2343
02:43:43,440 --> 02:43:44,040
Ooh, I'm gonna...

2344
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:44,220
Ooh.

2345
02:43:44,540 --> 02:43:45,720
Let me go deal with this.

2346
02:43:45,800 --> 02:43:46,920
I like how his text is real.

2347
02:43:47,340 --> 02:43:48,500
Oh, my God, no!

2348
02:43:48,980 --> 02:43:49,840
No, please!

2349
02:43:50,040 --> 02:43:51,520
We need to put duct tape over him.

2350
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:52,800
You like my daughter?

2351
02:43:55,060 --> 02:44:54,640

2352
02:44:54,640 --> 02:44:56,340
I hope that's the sound of us winning this thing.

2353
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:58,660
Me too.

2354
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:01,060
This motor inn's pretty damn defendable.

2355
02:45:01,480 --> 02:45:03,420
We block off the entrances with some cars.

2356
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:04,680
Keep someone on watch.

2357
02:45:04,980 --> 02:45:07,000
We could stay here until the military rolls through.

2358
02:45:07,960 --> 02:45:09,840
I actually agree with that plan.

2359
02:45:10,420 --> 02:45:13,040
Or if they blow through, as in blow up.

2360
02:45:13,060 --> 02:45:14,860
And most importantly, we got light.

2361
02:45:15,760 --> 02:45:17,320
There are worse places to call home.

2362
02:45:18,060 --> 02:45:18,740
Yeah, you're right.

2363
02:45:18,820 --> 02:45:20,760
Yeah, it's a good thing we took care of the lady in that room.

2364
02:45:20,780 --> 02:45:21,500
It's going to be okay.

2365
02:45:42,780 --> 02:46:07,290
oh why did they jinx it immediate fine if we survived the walkers never expected they'd starve us out oh poor Clementine I want you to have this okay in case you or Clementine starts feeling weak you don't know me anything Carly how you doing we got to get food Lee soon Heidi I'm Andrew st.

2366
02:46:07,290 --> 02:46:08,790
John we're from the st.

2367
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:14,550
John dairy Wow I never did thank you for saving duck from the walkers back at Herschel's farm.

2368
02:46:14,950 --> 02:46:15,730
Something's coming, Lee.

2369
02:46:16,170 --> 02:46:17,490
Here's gonna be a war.

2370
02:46:17,610 --> 02:46:17,930
Uh-oh.

2371
02:46:18,090 --> 02:46:20,270
The walkers don't worry me as much as the bandits.

2372
02:46:20,570 --> 02:46:20,970
Oh!

2373
02:46:20,970 --> 02:46:22,030
You fucked with us!

2374
02:46:23,310 --> 02:46:23,630
Who?

2375
02:46:23,770 --> 02:46:25,550
Now we're gonna take what we want!

2376
02:46:25,690 --> 02:46:26,130
What?

2377
02:46:26,430 --> 02:46:27,970
Why is Otacon behind us?

2378
02:46:41,140 --> 02:46:42,120
Oh, yeah.

2379
02:46:42,480 --> 02:46:44,000
No more, please.

2380
02:46:44,640 --> 02:46:45,560
No more, please.

2381
02:46:47,420 --> 02:46:48,200
Lee, please.

2382
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:55,650
Holy moly.

2383
02:46:55,830 --> 02:47:14,090
they just those are the worst kinds of trailers they tell you everything that's going on oh wow wait honestly lied to Herschel you and 63% of players were honest you and 49% of players chose to be duck

2384
02:47:18,820 --> 02:47:28,540
nobody wants to get duck you and 48% of players defended Kenny you and 45% of players gave her the gun.

2385
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,640
You had 76% of players chose Carly!

2386
02:47:32,200 --> 02:47:32,720
No!

2387
02:47:33,840 --> 02:47:35,500
I missed Doug.

2388
02:47:37,820 --> 02:47:39,040
I missed Doug.

2389
02:47:40,220 --> 02:47:41,100
I missed Doug.

2390
02:47:41,860 --> 02:47:42,840
I missed Doug.

2391
02:47:43,460 --> 02:47:45,680
I should have chose... I should have picked Doug.

2392
02:47:46,780 --> 02:47:47,600
Oh, God.

2393
02:47:48,920 --> 02:47:50,880
God, I should have picked Doug.

2394
02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:57,360
Put in batteries correctly.

2395
02:48:02,170 --> 02:48:19,120
Poor Dennis oh my god I should have picked Doug who's Doug don't do my man like that

2396
02:48:24,500 --> 02:48:35,060
yay we did the first episode I'm having so much fun so far poor Doug yeah poor dog.

2397
02:48:36,160 --> 02:48:38,340
I missed tennis.

2398
02:48:41,020 --> 02:48:43,100
Uh, why?

2399
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:45,120
Why, Doug?

2400
02:48:45,420 --> 02:48:46,360
Why not Larry?

2401
02:48:49,240 --> 02:48:50,000
Gosh.

2402
02:48:53,100 --> 02:49:01,060
But for the most part, I'm trying to be as like a quote unquote proper playthrough.

2403
02:49:02,220 --> 02:49:04,200
Trying not to cause too much chaos.

2404
02:49:04,280 --> 02:49:06,620
since this is my first time playing.

2405
02:49:07,620 --> 02:49:08,780
I do miss Doug.

2406
02:49:09,200 --> 02:49:10,800
I feel a lot of regret.

2407
02:49:12,740 --> 02:49:13,640
I'll do you one better.

2408
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:14,960
Why is Minky?

2409
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:16,580
Why is Minky?

2410
02:49:23,380 --> 02:49:24,620
I'm never gonna...

2411
02:49:24,620 --> 02:49:26,780
I'm never gonna go for the lady again.

2412
02:49:27,820 --> 02:49:28,660
Unless she's good.

2413
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:29,620
I don't know.

2414
02:49:30,460 --> 02:49:31,280
Harley's fine.

2415
02:49:31,400 --> 02:49:32,600
She's just really stupid.

2416
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:36,280
She's also kind of mean.

2417
02:49:36,900 --> 02:49:38,420
She thinks my ideas are bad.

2418
02:49:39,500 --> 02:49:42,220
She's not supportive at all.

2419
02:49:44,130 --> 02:49:45,260
Rip Danny.

2420
02:49:46,220 --> 02:49:48,640
Devin Dalton Jennifer.

2421
02:49:54,320 --> 02:49:55,460
Rip Dylan.

2422
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,170
Miss Flupipaz.

2423
02:50:00,580 --> 02:50:01,440
And me!

2424
02:50:01,880 --> 02:50:03,240
Oh my gosh, I'm here.

2425
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:08,400
War one out for Darren.

2426
02:50:09,740 --> 02:50:11,160
Carly's a good pick, though.

2427
02:50:12,020 --> 02:50:12,320
Ah.

2428
02:50:13,700 --> 02:50:14,340
Ah.

2429
02:50:16,320 --> 02:50:17,420
Rip, Devin.

2430
02:50:19,640 --> 02:50:20,900
But I guess we'll call it here.

2431
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:23,740
And we'll continue next week.

2432
02:50:27,490 --> 02:50:28,230
Yes, yes.

2433
02:50:29,110 --> 02:50:30,170
Continue next week.

2434
02:50:30,330 --> 02:50:35,170
Might actually do multiple of these episodes in a week.

2435
02:50:36,110 --> 02:50:38,430
Just so we can get... How many episodes is

2436
02:50:41,790 --> 02:50:43,130
Try Princess, thank you!

2437
02:50:44,530 --> 02:50:45,790
The proper playthrough.

2438
02:50:46,910 --> 02:50:47,870
Natural board.

2439
02:50:48,930 --> 02:50:51,010
Carly might not be the best asset on the team.

2440
02:50:51,690 --> 02:50:53,870
Not sure if she's above or below duck, though.

2441
02:50:54,650 --> 02:50:54,650
Duck?

2442
02:50:55,210 --> 02:50:55,210
Five?

2443
02:50:55,330 --> 02:50:55,750
Oh, okay.

2444
02:50:57,510 --> 02:50:58,350
Yeah, we'll see.

2445
02:50:58,510 --> 02:50:58,710
We'll see.

2446
02:50:59,430 --> 02:51:00,870
Five episodes per chapter.

2447
02:51:11,890 --> 02:51:12,310
We'll see.

2448
02:51:12,830 --> 02:51:13,130
Yeah.

2449
02:51:14,930 --> 02:51:16,930
All zombies this week for you, huh?

2450
02:51:17,310 --> 02:51:18,630
I'm all zombie.

2451
02:51:18,750 --> 02:51:20,890
I'm in my zombie era.

2452
02:51:21,930 --> 02:51:22,850
Thanks for the stream.

2453
02:51:22,990 --> 02:51:23,790
Your new outfit is very cute.

2454
02:51:23,970 --> 02:51:24,670
I'm so hyped for the cover.

2455
02:51:25,070 --> 02:51:25,750
Thank you.

2456
02:51:26,150 --> 02:51:27,870
Yes, I have a cover coming out, guys.

2457
02:51:28,750 --> 02:51:32,270
You should definitely watch it tomorrow when it premieres.

2458
02:51:32,490 --> 02:51:34,970
And I'm going to be doing some karaoke a little bit afterwards.

2459
02:51:37,030 --> 02:51:38,950
Logan, thanks for the vibe, get this.

2460
02:51:39,450 --> 02:51:40,050
Thank you.

2461
02:51:40,650 --> 02:51:40,990
Thank you.

2462
02:51:41,230 --> 02:51:41,430
Thank you.

2463
02:51:42,070 --> 02:51:44,210
And yeah, looking forward to it.

2464
02:51:44,390 --> 02:51:46,590
It's so... Gosh, the music video looks great.

2465
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:49,170
I just love the song.

2466
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:51,190
I'm super duper hyped for it.

2467
02:51:54,330 --> 02:51:55,930
I love Clem.

2468
02:51:56,370 --> 02:51:58,150
Basically the reason I have kids now?

2469
02:51:59,530 --> 02:52:00,350
Because of her?

2470
02:52:02,330 --> 02:52:04,970
I think Duck would have figured out the battery thing.

2471
02:52:06,990 --> 02:52:07,650
Duck.

2472
02:52:08,230 --> 02:52:08,770
Duck.

2473
02:52:09,630 --> 02:52:09,630
Duck.

2474
02:52:09,670 --> 02:52:12,950
Duck feels like a real boy.

2475
02:52:14,010 --> 02:52:15,670
Just yapping the poor Clem.

2476
02:52:18,110 --> 02:52:19,610
What a great birth week.

2477
02:52:19,910 --> 02:52:22,110
Dirty Laundry, happy birthday again!
