00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Happy Halloween!

2
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:37,700
Almost.

3
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,580
Spooky!

4
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,500
Hello, Kaini Dasai Masen!

5
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,800
Welcome to...

6
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,340
Isn't there such a lovely castle behind me?

7
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,980
I'm the...

8
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,700
I feel like the guard dog.

9
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,840
Because I'm like...

10
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,300
Because I'm...

11
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,160
Um...

12
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,300
But...

13
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,560
But I...

14
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,260
I should check a mirror?

15
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:20,300
I can't see my reflection.

16
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,560
Is something wrong?

17
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,280
Is everything okay?

18
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,980
I have ketchup on my face?

19
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
I didn't have a hamburger today, so...

20
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Jelly donut, no.

21
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,160
Oh!

22
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,040
Sorry.

23
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,100
Halloween falls on a Thursday, the 23rd this year?

24
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,520
Yes.

25
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,200
Yes, yes, yes.

26
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,040

27
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,840
Have a happy birthday!

28
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,100
MGS birthday song.

29
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
Sorry, I have no MGS today.

30
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:27,540

33
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,280
Happy birthday to you!

34
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
Happy birthday!

35
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,480
To all and to all a good night!

36
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,020
Not a good night.

37
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,760
Spooky night!

38
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,360
Today I have some spooky songs to sing for you all.

39
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,420
Some of them are more spooky than others, maybe.

40
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:22,300
it's a lot of songs that I don't think I have ever sung in karaoke before, so I'm very nervous.

41
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,440
I'm scared, but it's all fun, right?

42
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,260
It's all fun.

43
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,080
It's just a...

44
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,220
It's just a karaoke.

45
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,560
Spooky.

46
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,360
That's the scariest part.

47
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,500
That's the scariest part.

48
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,100
But because I have a set list, No requests today.

49
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,680
I'm sorry.

50
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:49,500
I did ask for requests for Membouz for Halloween songs.

51
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,780
And many, many people gave me many, many suggestions.

52
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,180
And so I took some of those that I felt like I knew or I could learn.

53
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,740
Some of these I learned like yesterday, so if I mess up...

54
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,740
If I mess up...

55
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:10,490
Yeah.

56
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:12,930
It's like your style, Minto.

57
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,090
Thanks.

58
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,750
But, uh, yeah.

59
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:26,190
There, you know, if you wanted a song, a Halloween song, I might be singing it.

60
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,450
So actually, I'm gonna write that real quick.

61
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,050
Please, no requests.

62
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,390
I have a set list.

63
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,650
Smiley face.

64
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:36,910
I have.

65
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,990
I don't have a smiley face.

66
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,430
I mean, I do have a smiley face.

67
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,790
Yeah.

68
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,730
I have a job interview today!

69
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,630
Is it okay if you can share your not-freaky Minto energy?

70
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,790
But my energy is always kind of freaky.

71
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:00,870
Um...

72
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,500
Uh...

73
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:07,860
Good.

74
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,040
You got this!

75
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,740
I also...

76
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,720
I got new headphones recently, you guys.

77
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:52,580
it moon drop I E M's it's really weird it's really weird with them mmm sounds fancy it's not quite good choice yeah they do fit well yeah they're inside my ears oh they have left and right labels they don't which I got the Aria 2.

78
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,380
So far I do like them.

79
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,780
Sometimes they crackle a little.

80
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,700
I don't know if that's because of my setup or...

81
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,740
I don't know if that's because of my setup or what.

82
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,300
Because if it's like I have so many cables everywhere.

83
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,040
But...

84
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,920
But yeah.

85
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,640
No left or right that's risky.

86
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
Wait, actually...

87
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,660
I wonder if I could test it somehow.

88
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,580
Actually you got... But I think I have it right.

89
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,560
I think so.

90
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,280
Maybe.

91
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,660
Aria 2 should have labels.

92
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh.

93
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,120
They didn't pin the message before.

94
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,620
Yes, I did.

95
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:43,800
I see a pinned right there.

96
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,500
I'm literally looking at them.

97
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,840
I see no left or right.

98
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,960
Well, they are red and black, maybe.

99
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,620
Maybe that's what you mean.

100
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,540
But also, they are made for specific ears, so you can't mix it up.

101
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:14,000
You can't mix it up, because one's shaped for one ear and one's shaped for the other ear.

102
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,020
So...

103
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,000
Whose blood is that?

104
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,700
It's the person that tried to enter the castle earlier.

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:41,120
And now, if you think you are worthy of entering the castle to meet my Ojo-sama, you must listen to my song.

106
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,180
I must serenade you.

107
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,460
I don't know what to start with.

108
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,580
I think I'm just gonna go in the order of what I wrote down.

109
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,320
Sure.

110
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,240
I'll just go in the order of what I wrote down.

111
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
This one's a classic.

112
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,660
This one is like the Halloween song.

113
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,540
Well not the Halloween.

114
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,820
It is a, it's, you'll know, you'll know, you'll know.

115
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,240
What if I'm not here for Ojo Sama and the gate guard is cute?

116
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:30,900
I'm not, uh, I am not, I'm, there's no route for me.

117
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,420
Yeah, I'm only unlockable in the DLC, maybe.

118
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,340
And you will get that in 10 years, maybe.

119
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,820
It ought to be illegal for ghosts to somehow keep getting cuter.

120
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,380
Foolish mortal.

121
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,440
Samoa, thank you so much for the 10 gifts, and thank you.

122
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,400
Okay.

123
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,600
Are we ready?

124
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm going to sing.

125
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,020
This is a fun one to start with.

126
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,520
Yeah, let's go!

127
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:13,560

129
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,850

133

That was the audio.

134
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,410
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run.

135
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:39,950
Oh yeah, feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun.

136
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,750
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination.

137
00:14:48,150 --> 00:15:05,710
But all the while You hear a creature creeping up behind You're out of time Cause this is thriller Thriller night There ain't no second chance Against a thing with 40 eyes, girl

Oh wait, I think I got the part wrong.

140
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,990
I thought this was, what's his name's part?

141
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,750
Where he just starts talking.

142
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:28,270
Sorry.

143
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,690
When does that guy start talking?

144
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:38,550
They're out again.

145
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,910
Prince and Prince, this evening's closing in on every side.

I'm gonna thrill you tonight, baby.

156
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,300
I didn't realize this song turned into a love song.

157
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,000
We have the soul full of getting down.

158
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,980
Must stand and face the hands of hell and rot inside the house's shell.

159
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,640
Oh, baby.

160

Oh, darling!

165
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,740
The foulest stenches in the air.

166
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,500
The funk of 40,000 years.

167
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,580
And grizzly goons from every tomb are close-finned to seal your doom.

168
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:08,460
And when you fight to stay alive, Your body starts to shiver before no immortal can resist.

169
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,100
Wait, I'm going to hear his laugh.

170
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,020
Yay, that was thriller.

171
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,420
I'm getting used to these new headphones.

172
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,180
So sorry if I'm like constantly asking what the volume is like.

173
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

174
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,770
Wow, that was very thrilling, was it?

175
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,330
I guess they are on a date, huh, in the music video.

I love that it's like so country and spooky at the same time.

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,220

Oh!

214
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,690
Yes, actually, I am a ghost.

215
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,070
I'm very real ghost.

216
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,010
I read the full message.

217
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:34,710
What do I say?

218
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,750
What do I say?

219
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,490
What do I say?

220
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:41,710
Congrats at the baby.

221
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,980
The next song I'm going to sing, I also sang last year.

222
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:01,180
I actually thought about not singing it this year, but I was like, no, I'm going to sing it this year because it's a Halloween song.

223
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,880
And it's composed by one of my favorite artists ever, Mosaic Wave.

224
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,780
And also performed by one of my favorite idol groups ever.

225
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,560
And I...

226
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,760
Wait, where's the MP3?

227
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,800
Oh, there it is.

228
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,320
Okay, just kidding.

229
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:21,720
And I...

230
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,980
What was I going to say?

231
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,780
Oh, okay, wait, I want to spoil something.

232
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,240
So I'm performing next week at U.S.

233
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,200
Idol Festival.

234
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,720
And I know it's Halloween weekend, but I'm actually not performing on Halloween.

235
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,240
But I made my set list before I knew.

236
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:49,700
And so my theme for my set list was kind of Halloween songs.

237
00:27:50,200 --> 00:28:22,240
Plus, like, I kind of was like, maybe I can kind of like show my appeal by being made by singing some really cute songs so they're kind of like it's like a progression of like halloween to cute song progression but they're all also kind of like spooky ish not all of them what's my set list again but anyway it's still halloween weekend if it's yeah i perform the day after halloween so everybody should still have a little bit of Halloween spirit,

238
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:22,800
right?

239
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,940
And so this is a song that I'm also going to be singing.

240
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,700
It's called Lumpling Box.

241
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:45,940
And so I want to sing it so that people can get used to the song because maybe it's not a super duper popular song in the West, but if I want to perform it all the time, I should just, I should contact Mosaic Wave and be like,

242
00:28:49,180 --> 00:29:15,920
the same for me like make this song number two for me and so the song is called you can look up you probably will find calls and stuff for it lumpling box but i want to help you guys for for for when i perform it because it's very fun i think in my opinion dark mental yeah i'm

243
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,740
If lumping box is so good, why is there no lumping box too?

244
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,420
I could beat the lumping box too.

245
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,720
Can you teach us the calls?

246
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do and try.

247
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,380
So I'm going to half sing and half do calls, okay?

248
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,360
Actually, wait.

249
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:38,560
What if I sing it first and then I do the calls, do second version?

250
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,960
I'll try that.

251
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,640
I'll try that.

252
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,340
It's kind of the song, the calls are really fine, so.

253
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,020
Okay.

254
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,100
Okay, I sing it first.

255
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,100
Okay.

256
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm resisting doing the calls!

257
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,680
I'm back!

258
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,930

259
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:40,030

260
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,250
I'm a girl, the moon gets lit up by the moon.

261
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:59,350
Tainty-cold is the end, the dark-earth cabot-cha-cha-wa-la-lou In the middle of the moon, there's a man-in-the-git-o-pa-no-oh-hime-same A-bosiggy box, I'll open it more, it won't stop.

262

The adults, the children, all of you, all look at me.

263
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,090
Come here, come here,

264
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,430

00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,560
Maybe I'll just...

271
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,380
I'll just show you guys later.

272
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,440
I'm half-faced.

273
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,720
How do I fix the camera?

274
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,780
Wait, I'm gonna scoot over a little.

275
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,500
Wait, I can't scoot over a little.

276
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,900
Oh, why is the camera always so weird to me?

277
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:41,500
Pleasure ride, thank you for rendering, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, you know what, let's just go to the next song, I'm embarrassed now.

278
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,900
I don't

279
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:52,550
know how to speak anymore.

280
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,750
Let's do another Japanese song while I'm in JP mood.

281
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,790
Actually,

282
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,540
I just realized I did not find a karaoke for this prior.

283
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,510
Wait.

284
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:25,330
Oh, shoot.

285
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,630
Oh, no.

286
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,970
Wait, I can find it.

287
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,210
I can find it.

288
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,870
I can do it.

289
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,210
I can do it.

290
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,870
We're doing it live.

291
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:35,790
We're doing it live.

292
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,630
This should be fine.

293
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,850
Let me double check it.

294
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:42,630
This should be fine.

295
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,650
Oh, it's loud.

296
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,560
What song is this?

297
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,240
What am I listening to?

298
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,520
No, it's not this one.

299
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,880
Oh, wait, is it this one?

300
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,840
Oh, this is, this works, this works, this works.

301
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:09,680
Okay, next is everybody, everybody should know this song, too.

302
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,280
Everybody should know this song, too.

303
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,320
I have a mix of Japanese and English songs.

304
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,860
I can't type either, I can't speak, I can't type.

305
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,340
Sorry, it goes off the thing.

306
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,320
Live, baby, live.

307
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,220
We're doing it live.

308
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,540
We're always doing it live.

309
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,270
Is this carry?

310
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:13,570
Okay.

311
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,840
I thought

312
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:52,110
they just included the background singers.

313
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:54,250
Okay.

314
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,430
Sorry, no background singers.

315
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,990
I'll do the same thing.

316
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,370
I'll take all the blood

317
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,130
from the blood to the dead.

318
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:58,460
I'll do it.

319
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:12,710
I'll take my hand to my my fingers.

320
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,610
I'll take it to the end.

321
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:22,390
The day's grayish is dark and darkens the night I'll do the dance.

322
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,420
I'll do it again.

323
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,190
I'll do it.

324
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,210
🎵

325
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:52,300
🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵

326
00:39:56,530 --> 00:40:03,530
🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 🎵 Oh, I've got to go in a little bit.

327
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:11,190
In the light of the light, I'm going to sit up there with a number of hands.

328
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:18,330
Come on, someone else will come to this place.

329
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:26,250
The other way, here, the hand will turn toward the way.

330
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,390
No need to move.

331
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,760
The only problem is I don't know when I come

332
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:19,360
here.

333
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:30,700
The only problem is I don't know when I come here.

334
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:59,100
The second one

335
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,080
got me

336
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,960
Thank you.

337
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,900
Thank you.

338
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:37,440
I didn't see the super chat, but I saw the notification of someone saying that they're new or who has been wondering about recording this or something.

339
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:47,360
But yes, feel, of course, I've had people clip and record the karaoke's before.

340
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,720
So, of course.

341
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,480
Thank you for asking, though.

343
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,320
I really appreciate it.

344
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,220
Hayden, thank you so much for the vibe.

345
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:57,440
Good day.

346
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,200
Thank you guys all for the silver chats and the donuts and everything and the gifted memberships.

347
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:03,480
Thank you.

348
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:06,740
Thank you so much.

349
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,180
Thank you.

350
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:08,780
Thank you.

351
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,320
Thank you.

352
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:09,960
Thank you.

353
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:10,400
Thank you.

354
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,000
Okay.

355
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:15,520
Let's see.

356
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,820
What's on my list?

357
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,910
I'm crossing out the ones that I've done.

358
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,090
this next song.

359
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:30,130
I sung quite recently, I think.

360
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:40,010
I think it fits... Wait, hold on.

361
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,090
I have to find the lyrics.

362
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:43,110
There we go.

363
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,990
I think it fits... Especially how I look.

364
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:48,370
I kind of look like a vampire, right?

365
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:49,530
A little bit.

366
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:51,790
I think.

367
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:54,510
Maybe I shouldn't do all the Japanese songs at once.

368
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:54,990
I don't know.

369
00:43:55,050 --> 00:43:55,350
Who cares?

370
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:56,150
It's my karaoke.

371
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:28,590
where is it I found it what's the difference I don't think there is one okay let me hold on let me make sure it's not too loud for you guys oh it's too quiet for you guys okay I turn it up the red certainly lends itself to that If I had a tube, one more tooth.

372
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,350
No, Vampire Minto, don't drink my blood.

373
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:35,310
Give me your blood.

374
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:37,770
Kanye East.

375
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:39,930
Thank you for that, guys.

376
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,070
I love it.

377
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,670
Healthcare installment.

378
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,230
Part I lost count.

379
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,020
I haven't been sick, so thank you.

380
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:49,440
Thank you.

381
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:49,960
Thank you.

382
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,240
All right.

383
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:53,540
Next song up.

384
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,640
We've got...

385
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:56,620
Actually, I don't know.

386
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,440
Well...

387
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:29,260

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,240

389
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,160
Personality types, sort of, right?

00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,180
M, G, for ghost.

391
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,900
Like, that's a blood type.

392
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,680
My type.

393
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,640
Are you saying I'm your type?

394
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:17,860
How what is all the Japanese games from the 90s teaching us about blood types is that still like common in Japan I wonder too if they're like if they if they're still very I mean I think they still know their blood type but do they still like kind of really care about the blood type

395
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:27,160
maybe i'm just not paying attention

396
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:53,700

Yes.

401
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,200
Spooky.

402
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,860
Just like this next song.

403
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,900
Well, I'm close.

421
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,020
Hold on, let me drink some more water.

422
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,340
I mean, not water.

423
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:22,620
I'm drinking blood.

424
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,220
Because I'm a vampire today.

425
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:27,060
Or...

426
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:28,400
What if I'm not a vampire?

427
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,220
Hmm?

428
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:32,560
What if...

429
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,940
What if I'm not a vampire?

430
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,920
What if instead...

431
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:39,620
I'm...

432
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:41,260
A cannibal!

433
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,380
I've only heard this song through Nimmy.

434
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,720
I had to learn it.

435
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,420
Cannibal!

436
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,500
Let's go.

437
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:03,190
Wait.

438
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:04,650
Hold on.

439
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:05,310
Sorry, redo?

440
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:07,330
Sorry.

441
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:09,370
I realized the vocals were on.

442
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,060
I have a heart, I swear I do, but that's not baby when it comes to you.

443
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,780
When you say you love me, harsh if you know what's good for you.

444
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,620
I think you're hot, I think you're cool.

445
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,500
You're the kind of guy I'd stalk in school.

446
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,500
But now that I'm famous, you're up my anus.

447
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,240
Now I'm gonna eat you, fool.

448
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:35,640
I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch.

449
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,320
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood.

450
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,160
Carnivore animal, I am a cannibal.

451
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,660
I eat boys up, you better run.

452
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,720
I am cannibal.

453
00:52:55,480 --> 00:53:09,920
I am cannibal I'll eat you up I am cannibal I'll

454
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:29,840
eat you up Whatever you tell me, I'm pretty That's when the hunger really hits me Your little heart goes pitter-patter I want your liver on a platter Use your finger to stir my tea Then for dessert Suck your teeth, be too sweet and you'll be a goner Yep,

455
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:50,870
I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch Then when I'm thirsty, I suck their blood Carnivore animal, I am a cannibal I eat boys up, you'd better run I'm a cannibal

456
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:58,290
I am a cannibal

457
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,610
I am cannibal

458
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:17,010
I'll beat you up I

459
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,960
am cannibal

460
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,640
I warned you

461
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:49,360
I am cannibal This song is so fun actually Sorry I tripped over some of the lyrics though I tried practicing but I have a performance anxiety Yeah!

462
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,640
Did you think that was the only cannibal song I had tonight?

463
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,180
Of course not.

464
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,160
Of course not.

465
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,880
Of course that's not the other only cannibal song I have tonight.

466
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:04,640
That would be ridiculous.

467
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,760
That would be so silly if I only had...

468
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:17,160
After all the games I've played recently that involve cannibalism, I of course have to sing the cannibal song.

469
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,940
I have to sing more cannibal.

470
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,120
You're walking in the woods.

471
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,420
There's no one around and your phone is dead.

472
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,140
Out of the corner of your eye, you see him.

473
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,000
He's following you about 30 feet back.

474
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,780
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint.

475
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,280
He's gaining on you.

476
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:45,880
Shail above.

477
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,540
You're looking for your car, but you're all turned around.

478
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:54,860
He's almost upon you now, and you can see there's blood on his face.

479
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,440
My God, there's blood everywhere!

480
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,700
Running for your life?

481
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,080
Oh, he's brandishing a knife.

482
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,500
It's Shia LaBeouf, lurking in the shadows.

483
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:14,380
Hollywood superstar, Shia LaBeouf, living in the woods, Shia LaBeouf, killing for sport, Shia LaBeouf, eating all the bodies.

484
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:23,220
Now it's dark and you seem to have lost him, but you're hopelessly lost yourself.

485
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:27,400
Stranded with a murderer, you creep silently through the underbrush.

486
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,340
Aha!

487
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,080
In the distance, a small cottage with a light on.

488
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:32,720
Hope.

489
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,780
You move stealthily toward it.

490
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,780
But your leg!

491
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,100
Ah!

492
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,500
It's caught in a bear trap!

493
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,740
Drawing off your leg!

494
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:39,940
Quiet, quiet.

495
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,300
Limping to the cottage.

496
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,600
Now you're on the doorstep.

497
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,140
Sitting inside.

498
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,300
Shia LaBeouf, sharpening an axe, Shia LaBeouf, but he doesn't hear you enter.

499
00:57:51,420 --> 00:58:07,220
Shia LaBeouf, you're sneaking up behind him, strangling superstar Shia LaBeouf, fighting for your life with Shia LaBeouf, wrestling a knife from Shia LaBeouf, stab it in his kidney, safe and last from Shia LaBeouf.

500
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:12,900
You limp into the dark woods, blood oozing from your stump leg.

501
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:15,960
You've beaten him, Shia LaBeouf.

502
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:38,600
Wait, he isn't dead, shy of surprise There's a gun to your head and death in his eyes But you can do just that soon Body slam superstar, Shia LaBeouf You can carry fight with Shia LaBeouf Normal Tuesday night for Shia LaBeouf You try to swing an axe at Shia LaBeouf But Drev is fading fast when you're stumbling He's dodging every swipe,

503
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:51,400
he parries to the left You counter to the right, you catch him in the neck You're chopping off his head now his head topples to the floor expressionless.

504
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,080
You fall to your knees and catch your breath.

505
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,680
You're finally safe from Shia LaBeouf.

506
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,240
Oh my god.

507
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,280
Oh my god.

508
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,120
Are you?

509
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:10,940
Who knows?

510
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,620
We need a part two.

511
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:19,730
How do some of you not know this song?

512
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,170
It's Shia LaBeouf song.

513
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:23,010
How do you guys not know?

514
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,250
Can you see a reflection?

515
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:27,230
Are you vampire cannibal?

516
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,110
Vampire cannibal?

517
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,450
I'm a ghost, actually.

518
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,670
I'm just cosplaying today.

519
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:33,650
Oh, that's okay.

520
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,030
This song is like an internet classic.

521
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,510
An elf called an irkling.

522
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,470
Original meaning elf king.

523
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,370
Lured kids away with songs to eat them.

524
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:47,810
Oh.

525
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,630

529
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:08,270
Because the original is so, it's like the most high effort shitpost ever.

530
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:13,980
Cosplaying is always okay.

531
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:15,960
What do you mean, by the?

532
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,300

I am the one hiding under your stairs.

540
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,900

555
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,300

There's no fun without a good scare.

562
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,140

01:08:45,180 --> 01:08:46,860

No mentioning.

589
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,560
Unless it's Nightmare Before Christmas.

590
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:56,120
Which I just sang.

591
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:58,820
Let's hear.

592
01:08:58,960 --> 01:08:59,280
I'll hear.

593
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,120
The next song will make you forget about, about,

594
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,200
about it.

595
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:14,960
It's...

596
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:25,960
Spooky, scary skeleton.

597
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,120
Spooky, scary skeleton.

598
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:32,440
Shock your soul.

599
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,740
Failure do tonight.

600
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:37,780
Spooky, scary skeleton.

601
01:09:37,860 --> 01:09:41,220
Skeletons speak with such a screech.

602
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:47,900
Shake and shudder in surprise when you hear these zombies shriek.

603
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,720
We're so sorry.

604
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:53,120
Skeletons, you're so misunderstood.

605
01:09:54,240 --> 01:10:00,100
You only want to socialize, but I don't think we should.

606
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:06,160
Cause spooky, scary skeletons shout startling, surely screams.

607
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:12,760
There's sarcophagus and just won't let you be.

608
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:31,080
Bro are shy, what's all the fuss?

609
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:37,040
But bags of bone seem so unsafe, it's semi-serious.

610
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,520
Spooky, scary skeletons are silly, all the same.

611
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:49,720
They'll smile and scramble slowly by and drive you so insane.

612
01:10:50,660 --> 01:11:04,660
Sticks and stones will break your bones They'll seldom let you snooze Spooky scary skeletons will wake you with a bell

613
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:37,110
Caprizu, no thank you so much for the ticket

614
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:47,950
Her song on repeat here, it's...

615
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:47,950
No!

616
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:57,550
No, no, no, this is why I'm here to keep you in the spooky mood Here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here.

617
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:02,480
Another one, another one, another one.

618
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,480
This one I'm nervous about.

619
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:09,460
I didn't know it very well, so I think I'll mess it up.

620
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:10,740
Sorry, in advance.

621
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:12,560
What happened?

622
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,220
I've been messing up today, though.

623
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,580
The skeleton sang it wrong?

624
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,280
So true!

625
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:22,260
Boo.

626
01:12:24,380 --> 01:12:25,460
Okay, hold on.

627
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:29,740
My throat.

628
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:35,540
That's okay, that's why I have a set list, so I know exactly how many songs I'm singing today.

629
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:40,600
Spooky, scary skeletons.

630
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:52,090
I put a spell on you.

631
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:00,210
You can't stop the things I do.

632
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:04,170
I ain't lying.

633
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:15,650

I thought this would be...

678
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,740
My ear is getting uncomfy.

679
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:43,720
Oh no.

680
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,920
I wonder if maybe the IEM is not for me.

681
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,080
Hmm.

682
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:53,740

Jankies.

687
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:12,330
Looking at the hex girls, like look at what they need to mimic a fraction of my power.

688
01:19:12,930 --> 01:19:13,710
What do you mean?

689
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:14,610
What?

690
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:15,330
What?

691
01:19:16,670 --> 01:19:17,270
Um.

692
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:19,950
Let's do this song next.

693
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,190
Because this one's fun.

694
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:25,490
And you can dance to it with me.

695
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:26,110
Yeah.

696
01:19:27,190 --> 01:19:28,770
Do you guys know the dance?

697
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:31,630
It's just to jump to the left.

698
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:33,990
Right?

699
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,750
It's easy.

700
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:37,170
It's easy.

701
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:42,420
It's easy.

702
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,780
Where's the

703
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:50,640
music?

704
01:19:52,740 --> 01:19:54,120
Hello?

705
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:57,070
Oh, there it is.

706
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,580
It's astounding.

707
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,320
Time is fleeting.

708
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:09,460
Madness takes its toll.

709
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:12,320
But listen closely.

710
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:15,060
Not for very much longer.

711
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:20,240
I've got to keep control.

712
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,480
I remember

713
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:30,180
drinking those moments.

714
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,900
Let's do the time warp again.

715
01:20:43,900 --> 01:20:47,460
Let's do the time warp again.

716
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,800
It's just a jump to the left.

717
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,520
And then a step to the right.

718
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,800
With your hands on your hips.

719
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,260
You'll bring your knees in tight.

720
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:09,830
But let's do the time warp again.

721
01:21:11,290 --> 01:21:37,610
Let's do the time warp again It's so dreamy Oh, fantasy free me So you can't see me No, not at all In another dimension With voyeuristic intention Well secluded I see all With

Let's do the time warp again Let's do the time warp again

727
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:13,100

Spoons is the room.

733
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:37,730
Right, yeah, because the spoons are in the picture frames.

734

Yeah.

735
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:39,910
Take a raincoat.

Ew, why?

737
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:43,450
Be careful the splash zone.

01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,030
With the toilet, the toilet paper.

739
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:48,090
Wait, what's the toilet?

740
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:49,030
I'm scared.

741
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:01,580

Duh.

744
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:49,360
This one, this next one is something that somebody requested.

745
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,720
They suggested it.

746
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,760
And I ended up really liking it, so I added it to the set list.

747
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,760
But I learned it just for this, so sorry again if I mess it up.

748
01:25:58,220 --> 01:26:02,040
But, hold on, let me hear how it starts, and then I should be able to remember.

749
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

750
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:33,940
I think I got it.

751
01:26:34,100 --> 01:26:34,760
I think I got it.

752
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,120
Let's turn off the vocal.

753
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:38,320
Okay.

754
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:41,300
Ugh, my throat today.

755
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,060
I'm so sorry.

756
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:43,920
After this, I'll take a little mint.

757
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:46,460
And I will take...

758
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,280
Not a break, but like, I'll...

759
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:49,720
Actually, how many songs do I have left?

760
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:53,980
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

761
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,680
Oh, there's quite a lot of songs.

762
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,080
I sing!

763
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:10,580
This one is called Necromancing Dancing by Bear Ghost.

764
01:27:43,610 --> 01:28:04,770
This is it, now we found it, I'm astounded Every time we'll be surrounded by a throng of marching dead Delicious, the riches, they glisten ahead It's a craze, they'll devour every hour of this endless Non-progressive inundations of their kind And lucky for you,

765
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:32,570
you're next on in line When I'm necromancing Everyone's dancing, no one can stop me, I dare you to try The dead are infused with sensational groove And they're coming for you, now there's nowhere to hide Yeah, I'm raising the dead I'm loving the dread Let's make some evil

766
01:28:37,150 --> 01:29:01,930
I'm in bliss, my cadavers drive a gathering People, people, seeing the deceased advance The risen or risen with rhythm and dance Dig up some flesh with plenty of mold Diseases appeasing for rickety bones And make it saucy with a hot incantation Dominion is served with a bubbling spirited,

767
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:29,470
vibrant subjugation Yeah I'm raising the day Have love in the dread Let's make some evil Yes, the dance of the dead Get out there and shred Let's make some evil

768
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:54,440
Cities lay waste and they celebrate Free now from their graves

769
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:10,960
So mints and proud It's over now Back from Las Valle You're all the same

770
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:47,380
Yeah, I'm raising the day I'm loving the dress Let's make some evil yeah the dance of the day get out there and shred and make some evil

771
01:31:01,970 --> 01:31:20,590

The next song is also one that I've never sung before.

773
01:31:25,930 --> 01:31:27,330
I'm gonna have to pull it up.

774
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:31,410
It's a Japanese, we're going, I think it's my last Japanese song, actually.

775
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:39,110
It is, I think, my last one.

776
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:48,660

01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,040

778
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,460
I think it's this one that I was doing, I practiced with before.

779
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:57,520
Um.

780
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,680
Oh, hold on.

781
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,520
Let me make sure it's not too loud and too soft or whatever, whatever.

782
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:09,040
This song is called, Suki Suki.

783
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:10,400
Dai Suki.

01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:13,140

Let's do it.

795
01:36:27,060 --> 01:36:29,240
Actually, I'll do this one then since I just did that one.

796
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,440
I'll do my best, but I don't know.

797
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,980
I might not be able to hit the note today.

798
01:36:37,140 --> 01:36:37,860
Let me try.

799
01:36:42,270 --> 01:36:43,850
We'll see.

800
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:45,110
Maybe.

801
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:48,550
In

802
01:37:06,430 --> 01:37:12,950
sleepy sand to me, in dreams he came.

803
01:37:14,190 --> 01:37:21,050
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name.

804
01:37:22,230 --> 01:37:25,530
And do I dream again?

805
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:28,690
For now I fall.

806
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:41,490
And all of the opera is there inside my mind.

807
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:13,760
Oh, you turn from me to glance behind.

808
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:15,480
The

809
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:25,900
opera is there inside your mind.

810
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:29,360
Yeah, get it.

811
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:41,880
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear.

812
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,900
I am the mask you wear.

813
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:49,600
It's me they hear.

814
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:57,400
My spirit and my voice in one combined.

815
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:09,720
The phantom of the opera is there inside my mind.

816
01:39:11,900 --> 01:39:13,040
Oh, I'm nervous.

817
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:40,260
Fantasies, you always knew that modern mystery were both in your mind.

818
01:39:40,280 --> 01:40:02,280
you and in this labyrinth where night is blind the phantom of the opera is here inside my mind

819
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:10,060
He's there, the

820
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:30,830
first...

821
01:40:30,830 --> 01:40:32,430
I'm going to stand, who?

822
01:41:09,060 --> 01:41:12,780
To the scene of sweet music's throne.

823
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:18,440
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music.

824
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:31,460
You have come here for one purpose and one alone.

825
01:41:32,360 --> 01:41:41,160
Since the moment I first heard you sing I have needed you with me Why is this guy yapping at the end of the song?

826
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:54,490
For my music Shut up I have no more parts That was the Phantom of the Opera

827
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:10,860
Oh I was so nervous I was so nervous Oh my gosh I second-guessed myself.

828
01:42:11,060 --> 01:42:15,940
That's why I didn't do it on the right time.

829
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:16,500
Sorry.

830
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:23,440
Ever since COVID, it's been very hard for me to hit when I got COVID a couple of years ago.

831
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:24,540
When was that?

832
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,500
I don't remember.

833
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:30,180
But it's harder for me to hit the high notes because of it.

834
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,620
So I feel... I feel...

835
01:42:34,620 --> 01:42:36,160
I feel good!

836
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:36,960
Yippee!

837
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:40,280
Yay!

838
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,300
Thank you guys for all the super chats!

839
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:43,580
Thank you so much!

840
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:45,040
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

841
01:42:45,460 --> 01:42:47,440
Valentine, thank you so much for the Hawkeye Super Bowl!

842
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:48,680
Thank you!

843
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,220
Thank you, thank you.

844
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:52,720
Yay!

845
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:56,320
Okay, I saw a few songs.

846
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,140
Left though, I got the hard ones out of the way.

847
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:03,220
Actually, there's one song.

848
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:03,640
You know what?

849
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:04,320
I'm just...

850
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:04,640
No.

851
01:43:05,780 --> 01:43:06,180
Well...

852
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:12,760
Okay, I didn't practice this one at all.

853
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:14,700
I thought it would be fun to do it live.

854
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:15,460
Okay.

855
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:26,580
Um, this one, um, I didn't practice it at all.

856
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:30,040
I don't even, I think I listened to the song twice.

857
01:43:32,140 --> 01:43:36,500
And, um, yep, I'm just gonna do my best.

858
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:39,200
And, uh, this one's for you.

859
01:43:39,220 --> 01:43:39,540
you.

860
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:43,220
Vicky, this one's for you.

861
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:50,620
I put it on my list and then I kept skipping over it for some reason.

862
01:43:50,780 --> 01:44:00,600
I think I forgot that I put it there or I was confusing it with a different song or something and I forgot.

863
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:03,280
So I didn't practice it.

864
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,840
We're doing it live.

865
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,900
We're doing it live.

866
01:44:10,780 --> 01:44:12,140
We're doing a lot.

867
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:18,520
You know me, the fighting freak knuckles?

868
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:20,080
We're at Pumpkin Hill.

869
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:21,000
You ready?

870
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,580
I ain't gonna let it get to me.

871
01:44:23,780 --> 01:44:26,100
I'm just gonna creep down in Pumpkin Hill.

872
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:27,900
I got to find my last piece.

873
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:28,880
I know that it's here.

874
01:44:29,120 --> 01:44:30,500
I can sense it within my feet.

875
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:32,840
A great emerald's power allows me to feel.

876
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:35,320
I can't see a thing, but it's around somewhere.

877
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:38,060
I'm gonna hold my head because I have no fear.

878
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,900
Crazy, crazy, a graveyard theory.

879
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,500
A ghost tried to approach me and got leery.

880
01:44:44,060 --> 01:44:46,120
Asked him a question and he vanished in a second.

881
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,880
I'm walking through the valley, some crying pumpkin in the alley.

882
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,800
Didn't seem happy, but they sure got to give me.

883
01:44:51,980 --> 01:44:54,220
Had to get him back up with a fist-metal crackup.

884
01:44:54,460 --> 01:44:56,820
I'm hearing someone say, you're a chicken, don't be scared.

885
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,460
I had to be the wind because nobody wasn't there.

886
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,120
I searched and researched as I climbed up the wall.

887
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,440
And then I started to fly.

888
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:04,820
I went in deeper.

889
01:45:09,900 --> 01:45:26,540
I know that it's here I sense it in my feet The great emerald's power Allows me to feel I can't see a thing But it's around here somewhere Gotta hold my head I have no fear The world sees crazy crazy A graveyard theory A ghost tried to approach me He got leery

890
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:39,640
This is Knuckles Who fears none It's It's Wait When is it this part.

891
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:39,860
Wait.

892
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:47,620
Real deal when it comes to my name, kid.

893
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:00,860
I'm gonna just creep.

894
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:03,620
Down in Pumpkin Hill, I gots to find my last piece.

895
01:46:03,860 --> 01:46:04,720
I know that it's here.

896
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:06,080
I can sense it in my feet.

897
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:08,700
The great emerald's power allows me to feel.

898
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,340
I can't see a thing, but it's around somewhere.

899
01:46:11,700 --> 01:46:14,080
I gotta hold my head, cause I have no fear.

900
01:46:14,340 --> 01:46:16,760
This probably seems crazy, crazy graveyard theory.

901
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,500
A ghost tried to approach me and got leery.

902
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:22,140
Ask him a question and he vanished in a second.

903
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,820
I'm walking through valleys crying pumpkin in the alley.

904
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:27,580
Didn't seem happy but they sure tried to get me.

905
01:46:27,860 --> 01:46:29,760
Had to back him up with the fist metal.

906
01:46:29,860 --> 01:46:30,400
Crack him.

907
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:35,400
Because no one wasn't there.

908
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:39,460
I searched and I searched as I climbed up the wall and then I started to fly.

909
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,940
I went in deeper.

910
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,100
Let it get to me.

911
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:44,780
I'm just gonna creep down a pumpkin hill.

912
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,380
I got some fun with hot bees.

913
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:47,380
Know that it's here.

914
01:46:47,400 --> 01:46:48,820
I sense it in my feet.

915
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:51,460
The great emerald power allows me to feel.

916
01:46:51,740 --> 01:46:54,080
I can't see a thing, but it's around somewhere.

917
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:55,460
I gotta hold my head.

918
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:56,820
I have no fear.

919
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,500
It probably seems crazy, crazy, graveyard theory.

920
01:46:59,820 --> 01:47:00,980
A ghost tried to approach me.

921
01:47:01,180 --> 01:47:02,220
He got leery.

922
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:06,500
Spooky up in here.

923
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:08,660
It's crazy in here.

924
01:47:09,780 --> 01:47:11,720
We still gotta keep it going.

925
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:12,680
I'm Knuckles.

926
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:15,160
Nobody scares me.

927
01:47:15,480 --> 01:47:15,660
Oh.

928
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,520
Who dares me?

929
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:20,540
Whoever wants it?

930
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:21,340
Bring it.

931
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:22,680
I don't care.

932
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:24,160
We can do this.

933
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,790
They come step up to the plate.

934
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:32,850
Mr. Match.

935
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:34,470
It ain't no thing.

936
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,340
I went in deeper.

937
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,120
I didn't listen to the lyrics before that.

938
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:19,520

941
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:58,450
Hold on, let me have a mint.

942
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:02,510
And then we can chat, and then I'll do some more song.

943
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:16,800
Last song will, ironically, be from Ghostbusters.

944
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:19,060
Why are you trying to call my set list, huh?

945
01:49:20,240 --> 01:49:21,160
You don't know anything.

946
01:49:24,830 --> 01:49:26,550
It's not what I had planned, actually.

947
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:31,470
It's not what I had planned, actually.

948
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:35,330
Minto eating a mint?

949
01:49:36,250 --> 01:49:36,730
Cannibalism!

950
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:39,390
Actually, I have to find something.

951
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:47,160
I have to find a certain karaoke of something, actually.

952
01:49:53,140 --> 01:49:55,200
Are you guys feeling Halloween mood?

953
01:49:56,720 --> 01:49:58,440
Do you guys do trick-or-treaters?

954
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:00,920
More cannibalism.

955
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,660
Do you guys do... do you die?

956
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,520
I almost said, do you guys do cannibalism?

957
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,540
Do you guys do trick-or-treaters?

958
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,900
Yeah, I know, I used to.

959
01:50:18,770 --> 01:50:20,850
I don't get any at my maid cafe.

960
01:50:21,010 --> 01:50:21,870
I think they're too scared.

961
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:26,510
I think they maybe think it's, uh, maybe they think it's abandoned.

962
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:36,590
I mean, it kind of is, but, you know, I would still leave, like, a bowl out or something if anybody came by, nobody shows up.

963
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:38,270
Sad.

964
01:50:44,060 --> 01:50:46,100
I turned the lights down and pretend I'm not home.

965
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:49,860
You're the house nobody likes.

966
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:57,940
I don't know where my Bustin...

967
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:03,480
I don't know where my Bustin instrumental is.

968
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,300
Wait, it might be.

969
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:06,700
Oh wait, hold on.

970
01:51:07,140 --> 01:51:07,980
Under here maybe?

971
01:51:09,100 --> 01:51:09,340
No?

972
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,340
I have no idea.

973
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:15,280
Let me search.

974
01:51:15,940 --> 01:51:16,420
Bustin.

975
01:51:18,620 --> 01:51:19,640
Oh, Bustin!

976
01:51:21,240 --> 01:51:22,700
I found it.

977
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:24,780
I found it.

978
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:25,460
I found it.

979
01:51:27,500 --> 01:51:29,360
I'm not going to do it just yet, though.

980
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:36,940
Are you guys having fun?

981
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,240
Are you guys enjoying the karaoke?

982
01:51:40,560 --> 01:51:41,120

983
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,900

This is so good.

995
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:00,280
Did you guys see the Oimo art for the main cafe club with Asayoru?

996
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,420
I wish I could show you my thighs.

997
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:10,900
Oimo was just like, You will have booty.

998
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:13,360
I got here late.

999
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:14,500
Well, thanks for dropping by.

1000
01:53:15,100 --> 01:53:15,960
Thank you.

1001
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:18,260
Have you ever played Corpse Party?

1002
01:53:18,360 --> 01:53:19,980
Yeah, I love Corpse Party.

1003
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:22,920
Shangri-La from that game.

1004
01:53:26,380 --> 01:53:27,740
But I don't remember it.

1005
01:53:31,890 --> 01:53:33,350
I wish I could show it.

1006
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:35,470
But let me look it up.

1007
01:53:39,260 --> 01:53:40,000
It got sent...

1008
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,200
It got sent to me, but now I can't find it.

1009
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:59,570
I almost played a corpse party for October.

1010
01:54:02,070 --> 01:54:06,970
But it's not that it's a lot of voice acting because it's voiced in Japanese, but...

1011
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:08,930
I don't know.

1012
01:54:09,410 --> 01:54:11,550
I don't know why I didn't.

1013
01:54:12,790 --> 01:54:15,110
Would you try out FNAF one day?

1014
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:16,950
Like the game?

1015
01:54:17,130 --> 01:54:17,870
Play it!

1016
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:20,090
I played the ball pit.

1017
01:54:20,490 --> 01:54:21,890
I played the ball pit game.

1018
01:54:22,850 --> 01:54:24,310
I'll be giving out candy this year.

1019
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:25,250
Yippee!

1020
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:27,430
My neighborhood gets a lot of trick-or-treaters.

1021
01:54:27,570 --> 01:54:28,450
It has since I was a kid.

1022
01:54:28,710 --> 01:54:30,030
Wait, that's so fun!

1023
01:54:33,510 --> 01:54:34,650
It's a lot of reading.

1024
01:54:35,010 --> 01:54:36,990
I love Corpse Party though.

1025
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,970
It's so good.

1026
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:39,890
It's so good.

1027
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:45,370
You

1028
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:53,940
can't mention thighs without follow-up.

1029
01:54:54,020 --> 01:54:55,740
I can't show you the pictures.

1030
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:59,520
You'll have to wait until Aseyoru shows the full image.

1031
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,920
So, sorry, sorry.

1032
01:55:04,740 --> 01:55:05,120
Okay.

1033
01:55:05,740 --> 01:55:08,560
I finished my cough drop.

1034
01:55:11,780 --> 01:55:13,040
Let's do...

1035
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,460
Another song!

1036
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:19,840
Update your March link.

1037
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:20,540
It still goes to...

1038
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:24,840
That's still the main link at the moment.

1039
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:27,700
The other one expires at the end of the month, so...

1040
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,160
I know what I'm doing.

1041
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,880
Stop policing me!

1042
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,080
My goodness!

1043
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:41,340
Take a page out of your book and play RE6 of the Buddy.

1044
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,580
Oh, nice!

1045
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:43,340
Have fun!

1046
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:44,220
Have fun!

1047
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,320
Kupokan.

1048
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:51,360
is coming to Montreal this weekend.

1049
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,760
I'll be cosplaying rude from FF7 Rebirth.

1050
01:55:54,940 --> 01:55:55,880
Can I get a make new friends?

1051
01:55:56,600 --> 01:55:57,120
BEEP!

1052
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,020
Good luck, customer.

1053
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,920
You'll be rude.

1054
01:56:01,300 --> 01:56:02,700
Well, don't be rude, but you know.

1055
01:56:03,520 --> 01:56:06,800
Don't be rude, but like, but you know.

1056
01:56:08,200 --> 01:56:09,040
But be rude.

1057
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:11,220
And people will be like, wow, that's rude.

1058
01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:11,980
That's rude.

1059
01:56:12,200 --> 01:56:14,800
Don't have people be like, that's rude.

1060
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,760
And not be like, that's rude.

1061
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,900
I also learned this, well, okay, I knew this song.

1062
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,780
But I also didn't know this song.

1063
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:30,120
You know when you, like, hear a song all the time and then you don't learn it, like, properly?

1064
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,420
So I'm going to try with this one.

1065
01:56:56,520 --> 01:56:57,900
Who's watching me?

1066
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:12,490
I'm just an average man with an average life.

1067
01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:13,310
Why are you speaking?

1068
01:57:13,330 --> 01:57:14,510
I work from nine to five.

1069
01:57:15,110 --> 01:57:16,710
Hell, I pay the price.

1070
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:18,510
All I want is to be left alone.

1071
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:20,570
in my average home.

1072
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:24,190
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?

1073
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:29,010
And I always feel like somebody's watching me.

1074
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:30,910
And I have no privacy.

1075
01:57:31,590 --> 01:57:36,810
Oh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.

1076
01:57:37,290 --> 01:57:37,810
Tell me.

1077
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:38,310
Is there

1078
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,070
a way I broke the door real tight?

1079
01:57:47,950 --> 01:57:49,470
People call me on the phone.

1080
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:50,690
I'm trying to avoid.

1081
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:54,850
Can people see TV, TV, or am I just paranoid?

1082
01:57:55,150 --> 01:58:18,310
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair Because I might open my eyes and find someone standing there People say I'm crazy I'm just a little touched But maybe showers remind me of psycho Too much, that's why I always feel like somebody's watching me And I have no privacy Oh,

1083
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:22,030
I always feel like somebody's watching

1084
01:58:56,420 --> 01:59:01,200
me I don't know anymore Are the neighbors watching me?

1085
01:59:02,300 --> 01:59:04,540
Well, is the mailman watching me?

1086
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:05,140
Watch it.

1087
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,020
And I don't feel safe anymore.

1088
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:08,460
Oh, what a mess.

1089
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:10,460
I wonder who's watching me now.

1090
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:12,040
The IRS!

1091
01:59:13,100 --> 01:59:17,300
I always feel like somebody's watching me.

1092
01:59:18,040 --> 01:59:19,320
And I have no privacy.

1093
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:25,100
Oh, I always feel like somebody's watching me.

1094
01:59:25,560 --> 01:59:27,380
Tell me, is it just a dream?

1095
01:59:27,380 --> 01:59:38,740
I always feel like somebody's watching me And I have no privacy I always feel like somebody

1096
01:59:59,410 --> 02:00:03,430
I always feel like somebody's watching me

1097
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:10,360
I always feel like somebody's watching

1098
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:34,220
I always feel like somebody's watching me

1099
02:00:38,080 --> 02:00:41,220
I always feel like somebody's watching

1100
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,940
I always feel like somebody's watching

1101
02:01:38,650 --> 02:01:43,170
Surely it couldn't be the people that are watching the stream, right?

1102
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:47,240
Right?

1103
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:50,640
No, no!

1104
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:54,530
Surely is surely.

1105
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:55,920
That's not my name.

1106
02:01:58,140 --> 02:01:59,940
Gosh, I always get it wrong.

1107
02:02:01,700 --> 02:02:04,440
That was somebody's watching me.

1108
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:05,460
Spooky's always.

1109
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:07,500
Well, thank you so much, Redox.

1110
02:02:08,340 --> 02:02:09,040
Thank you.

1111
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:09,460
Thank you.

1112
02:02:10,360 --> 02:02:10,600
Thank you.

1113
02:02:10,860 --> 02:02:11,420
Thank you.

1114
02:02:11,780 --> 02:02:12,140
Thank you.

1115
02:02:14,080 --> 02:02:15,260
Okay, this one.

1116
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:16,120
Sorry, Minto.

1117
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:17,000
I'll stop watching.

1118
02:02:17,260 --> 02:02:17,700
No!

1119
02:02:18,140 --> 02:02:18,820
Come back.

1120
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:22,890
This next one, hold on.

1121
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:23,910
Let me get it.

1122
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:26,450
I have to do something special with it.

1123
02:02:26,550 --> 02:02:27,550
So give me a second.

1124
02:02:27,870 --> 02:02:28,510
Don't listen.

1125
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:28,870
Don't listen.

1126
02:02:28,970 --> 02:02:29,550
Okay, there we go.

1127
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:30,290
All right.

1128
02:02:30,330 --> 02:02:30,730
Hold on.

1129
02:02:33,050 --> 02:02:33,490

1133
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:19,260
So we have our special version.

1134
02:03:19,480 --> 02:03:22,940
I actually, back before I went to heaven, I would end my stream.

1135
02:03:23,780 --> 02:03:26,000
Almost every time with this song.

1136
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:31,580
I would end it with this song almost every single time.

1137
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:34,360
Such nostalgia.

1138
02:03:34,460 --> 02:03:36,720
Every time I hear this song, it's such nostalgia for me.

1139
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,740
So please listen...

There we go.

1144
02:04:16,730 --> 02:04:20,270
There's something strange sleeping in your bed.

1145
02:04:23,110 --> 02:04:23,830
Let me tell you something.

1146
02:04:25,110 --> 02:04:28,430
That there's something weird sleeping in your bed.

Geek Ghost Man.

1154

Freaking Man, baby!

1155
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:09,250
Let me sleep in your bed.

1156
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:12,830
I

1157
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:24,070
am afraid of no sleep.

1158
02:06:24,730 --> 02:06:26,470
I am afraid of no bed.

1159
02:06:41,320 --> 02:06:43,960
Busting, busting, busting, busting, busting, busting.

Bustin I remember Ghostbusters being this freaky I definitely remember it being that freaky I definitely remember Ghostbusters being very freaky.

1163
02:08:07,970 --> 02:08:10,750
Guys, it's a little bit of a shorter stream.

1164
02:08:10,910 --> 02:08:15,410
I think I kind of like flew through these songs, but that's okay.

1165
02:08:16,410 --> 02:08:19,770
I had 20 songs and one encore song.

1166
02:08:22,350 --> 02:08:26,370
But I have just a couple songs left.

1167
02:08:26,910 --> 02:08:28,010
Just a couple songs.

1168
02:08:29,450 --> 02:08:31,150
20 songs in two hours.

1169
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:32,650
It's kind of crazy though, no?

1170
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:41,770
This one is one that you all have been waiting for.

1171
02:09:00,200 --> 02:10:14,160
I was working in the lab late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie sight for my monster from his slab began to rise and suddenly to my surprise He did the monster mash The monster mash It was a graveyard smash He did the mash It cut on in a flash He did the mash He did the monster mash From my laboratory in the castle east To the master bedroom where the vampires feast The ghouls all came from their humble abodes To get a jolt from my electrodes They did the mash Monster Mash It was a graveyard smash They did the mash It caught on in a flash They did the mash They did the monster mash The zombies were having fun The party had just begun The guests included Wolfman Dracula and his son The scene was rocking And all great,

1172
02:10:14,540 --> 02:10:15,320
well wait, oh, is it?

1173
02:10:15,460 --> 02:10:18,500
Igor on chains backed in his bang house.

1174
02:10:19,140 --> 02:10:25,320
The coffin bangers were about to arrive with their vocal group, the Crypt Kikrfan.

1175
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:26,320
They played the MASH.

1176
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:28,620
They played the Monster MASH.

1177
02:10:29,100 --> 02:10:29,860
The Monster MASH.

1178
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:32,360
And it was a graveyard smash.

1179
02:10:32,380 --> 02:10:33,400
They played the MASH.

1180
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:35,940
It caught on in a flash.

1181
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:36,920
They played the MASH.

1182
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:39,640
They played the Monster MASH.

1183
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:46,560
Out from his coffin, Drax hoisted ring, Seems he was troubled by just one thing.

1184
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:53,560
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said, Whatever happened to my Transylvania twins?

1185
02:10:53,800 --> 02:10:54,600
It's now the MASH!

1186
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:56,920

For you the living, this mash was meant to.

1196
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:21,920
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you.

1197
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:22,860

Then you can mash.

1202
02:11:30,280 --> 02:11:32,440
You'll catch on in a flash.

1203
02:11:32,700 --> 02:11:33,460
Then you can mash.

1204
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:36,400

One more time.

1242
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:56,550
Then through the mist, by the milk light of moon, all that was lost is revealed.

1243
02:14:58,150 --> 02:15:03,630
Our long bygone burdens, mere echoes of the spring.

1244
02:15:04,770 --> 02:15:07,250
But where have we come?

1245

And where shall we end?

1246
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:19,250
If dreams can't come true, then why not pretend?

1247
02:15:21,470 --> 02:15:32,850
How the gentle wind beckons through the leaves as autumn colors fall.

1248
02:15:37,250 --> 02:15:49,250
