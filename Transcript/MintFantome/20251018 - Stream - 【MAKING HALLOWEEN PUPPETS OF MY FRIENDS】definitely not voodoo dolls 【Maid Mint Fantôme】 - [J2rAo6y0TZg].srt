1
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,890
Just

2
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:19,980
kidding.

3
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,180
Wait, oh.

4
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,140
Did I?

5
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,780
Ah!

6
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,680
Spooky!

7
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,640
Spooky!

8
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,900
Who was that?

9
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:52,090
I actually had to possess somebody today for today's craft, so uh, enjoy!

10
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,530
Ah!

11
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:57,950
Ah!

12
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:03,790
For today's craft, um, uh, sorry.

13
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:11,830
The lighting makes my sleeves look not white, but please be assured that they are white.

14
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,350
Or maybe they're just dirty.

15
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:22,590
I need to wash my jacket.

16
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,770
Hello!

17
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,180
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

18
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,060
Looks great to me.

19
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,340
Uh-oh.

20
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,620
Are you learning your colorblind today?

21
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
I am learning your colorblind today!

22
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,600
Senor, thank you so much for the video that you did!

23
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,780
Thank you!

24
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,820
Well guys, now I'm nervous.

25
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
I don't know why.

26
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,430
Cute witch.

27
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,970
I'm a witch.

28
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:07,970
I'm a witch.

29
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,090
Today!

30
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,450
Today, we are...

31
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,190
Making puppets!

32
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,590
And I needed some hands to make the puppets.

33
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,870
So I possessed somebody.

34
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,050
And this is them.

35
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,230
Voodoo dolls?

36
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,250
No, no, no.

37
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,690
No, no, no.

38
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,770
No, just...

39
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,190
Well, okay.

40
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,390
They're just puppets.

41
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,030
But isn't that kind of spooky too?

42
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,790
if it's like, okay, being a puppet is kind of terrifying too, no?

43
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,090
Oh, the wind.

44
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,930
So, oh, I have something for you guys.

45
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,790
Welcome to the made cafe.

46
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,990
I baked you.

47
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,990
Well, actually, I accidentally left it in the oven for too long, I forgot about it.

48
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,670
I made you a cookie.

49
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:13,890
I have three.

50
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,330
Would you like to eat my cookie?

51
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,150
You love those?

52
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:20,430
Vito!

53
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,830
These are my favorite!

54
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,030
These are my favorite!

55
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:25,110
So...

56
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,550
Dozo?

57
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,410
Oh, that was so yummy, Vito.

58
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,130
Your cooking is delicious.

59
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,830
That's the bestest ever.

60
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,730
Or, wait.

61
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,990
Oh, Vito!

62
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,270
That was the best thing I've ever tasted!

63
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,830
How did you come up with such a brilliant recipe?

64
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,450
You're like...

65
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,630
A wizard!

66
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,170
Ah!

67
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,770
Stop it.

68
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,750
Stop it.

69
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,650
Stop it.

70
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,010
It was simple.

71
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,330
And look at this design?

72
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,770
How could she- how did she do it?

73
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,870
How did she do it?

74
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,490
Thank you guys, thank you!

75
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,570
Also, wait, I'm so sorry.

76
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,190
Oh my gosh, I missed a...

77
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:12,490
Aka.

78
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:14,230
No, well thank you!

79
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,570
The human of today has cute nails.

80
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:23,330
No, the human of today might have painted them just for this stream

81
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:46,090
So I'm not used to having Human nails so I possessed and then I painted so they might don't look so much they might be a little a little messy But I can do the Ariana Grande Aha,

82
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:58,780
look how my hand is in my oversized sweater.

83
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,200
Oh, you want to see how small my wrist is?

84
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,940
It's so, oh, my tiny wrist is so small in this oversized jacket.

85
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,760
I might be the tiniest person ever.

86
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,230
What do you mean, noodle eyes?

87
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:26,710
What?

88
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,640
Okay.

89
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,740
Oh, let me eat my cookies.

90
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,360
Hold on.

91
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,680
Look how cute these...

92
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,040
I almost called them blankets.

93
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,220
What are these called?

94
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Napkins.

95
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Look how cute they are.

96
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,300
Oh, I'm getting crumbs on my desk already.

97
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,120
Oh, gosh.

98
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,540
Okay.

99
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,700
Don't look.

100
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,200
Look how cute these are, though.

101
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,280
And they have like little fringe at the bottom.

102
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,780
For some reason.

103
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,800
It's kind of like a dress.

104
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,060
Actually, what happens if I pull it apart?

105
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,140
Oh!

106
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,420
What?

107
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,960
It's my birthday, please, homie!

108
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,080
Carbon!

109
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,120
Oh my gosh!

110
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,420
I split them into two!

111
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,740
Wait, this is like a whole pack, though.

112
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,940
Maybe I have too many now.

113
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,960
Wait, what happens if I split this guy into two?

114
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,280
Surely it...

115
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,700
They can't be that thin.

116
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,820
Oh, okay, wait.

117
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,660
Oh, wait.

118
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,540
Seriously?

119
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,400
Wait.

120
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,620
Huh?

121
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,720
No, I think it has to...

122
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,900
It doesn't unfold?

123
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,300
Goes to mitosis.

124
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:01,710
Oh!

125
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

126
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,190
Like so.

127
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:06,390
Oh,

128
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:10,480
wow!

129
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,520
Is this how wisps are born?

130
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:13,740
Maybe.

131
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,940
Oh, wait, it's so cute, actually.

132
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,440
Wait, it's actually so cute.

133
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,640
Sorry, this one had a lobotomy.

134
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,480
That's you.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,600
Baby!

136
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,710
Okay, cookie time.

137
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,430
Cookie time, because I totally didn't stall enough for this stream.

138
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:50,330
But I also left them in for too long, and so they're a little crunchy instead of...

139
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,830
Instead of chewy.

140
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,070
So I'm kind of sad.

141
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:57,390
I had one already.

142
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,450
Okay, itadakimasu.

143
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay, bye-bye.

144
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,510
Whoa.

145
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:29,430
Yep, yep, thank you so much for the time, thank you, thank you so much for the gift.

146
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,030
Thank you, guys, thank you.

147
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,050
So I'm making hand puppets today.

148
00:12:34,230 --> 00:13:03,610
like so sorry my this finger is like double jointed so it can't bend properly um but yeah so oh i have no movement but i will move but mostly i have a live show And this is gonna be showing me who will pass it.

149
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,090
Wait, where is the...

150
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:15,390
Wait, so...

151
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,630
I thought...

152
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,470
I don't know how long it will take to make a puppet.

153
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,930
So I chose a couple people to make it.

154
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,210
And I thought maybe I'll do sloppy sisters.

155
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,690
And like one more person.

156
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,690
And maybe me?

157
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,690
but at the same time

158
00:13:37,050 --> 00:14:03,110
one my store did not have so many fabric colors so so we're gonna do our best they're gonna be Halloween themed so I have yeah five and then I chose each every person to have a costume.

159
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,050
And so...

160
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,790
Oh wait, where's my fabric?

161
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,750
I have a bunch of felt and it will turn into people.

162
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,470
Happy...

163
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,350
Woo!

164
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,080
Okay.

165
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,340
See how I did...

166
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,520
Oh.

167
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,740
Wait, hold on.

168
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,700
Let me move the cookies.

169
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,660
Oh.

170
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,940
You guys enjoy?

171
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,140
Actually, only one was enough, I think, for me.

172
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
I had two.

173
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,720
Don't worry about it.

174
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:37,340
Stop!

175
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:39,900
Oh my god!

176
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:47,880

177
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,360

181
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:54,920
Pause, pause, pause, pause.

00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,280
I will post.

185
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,400
I will post this.

186
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,340
What's my next day off?

187
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,060
Sunday?

188
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:06,700

287
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,780

288
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,840
There we go.

289
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,540

290
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,760

292
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,220
Oh, you can't see my mug!

293
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,260
It's ghost!

294
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,600
Isn't it so cute?

295
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,160
This is one of my favorite mugs.

296
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,660
Little ghosts.

297
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,100
Little ghosts.

298
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,520
Okay.

299
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:17,720

301
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:22,380
Wait.

302
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,260
Wait, I had this idea.

303
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,280
Should I...

304
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,500
Should I...

305
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,280
What if...

306
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,000
Okay, what if...

307
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:40,740
I was gonna tell you guys who I'm working on, But what if instead I start working on somebody and then you guess who I'm working on?

308
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,160
It was my birthday on the 14th, but I fell in a river.

309
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,080
What topic?

310
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,400
Hey!

311
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,470
Keep it a secret.

312
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,510
I think you guys might know the first one, though.

313
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:01,590
Maybe.

314
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,480
Wait, actually...

315
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,200
Oh, no, these are still fabric scissors, so I'll use them.

316
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,890
Okay, all right, let's get our first victim then.

317
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:26,850
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to trace my hand on this, and then that will be our base.

318
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,070
Do I know what I'm doing?

319
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:29,970
No.

320
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,710
I have no idea.

321
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,470
I have no idea what I'm doing.

322
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,530
But we're going to try anyway.

323
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,450
Wait if I could do half...

324
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:41,190

00:25:45,530 --> 00:26:12,660

I'm scared!

328
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,040
Wait.

329
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,980
Shouldn't it be in the shape of the person?

330
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,360
Wait.

331
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,000
Wait.

332
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,260

Wait, I don't know what I'm doing.

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,860
It's staying the desk.

339

don't worry this mat is very old and has actually it has like stains here too and stuff don't worry about it don't worry about it i'm not gonna cry

371
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,300
I'm just kidding.

372
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,140
What color are the scissors?

373
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:48,900
Blue!

374
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,140
Oh.

375
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,100
Because, you know, sometimes I eat ramen.

376
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,280
Um, on my desk.

377
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,760
Wait, is it?

378
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,800
Maybe I should have.

379
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,120
No, it's fine.

380
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,540
I was going to say maybe I should have pinned it.

381
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,900
But I don't think I have any pins left.

382
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,400
I think I got rid of all.

383
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,020
Oh gosh, okay.

384
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,940
I'm trying to make it not slip around anymore.

385
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,120
Uh-oh.

386
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,760
That's fine.

387
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,720
Oh, uh-oh.

388
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,240
Wait.

389
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,960
I think I just didn't fold it correctly.

390
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,460
I don't think it slipped or anything.

391
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I think it just didn't fold it right.

392
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:46,880
Oh,

393
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,660
I forgot to plug in.

394
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,780
That was definitely one of the super chats of all time.

395
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,860
Don't repeat it.

396
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,640
Don't repeat it.

397
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,380
Don't repeat it.

398
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,320
Stokey board.

399
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,400
How did you know?

400
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,760
How did you know?

401
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,280
Open bit?

402
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:12,660
No!

403
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,110
Wait, hold on.

404
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,290
Let me plug in my...

405
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:24,470
I forgot to plug in the hot glue gun.

406
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:28,830
Don't...

407
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,370
Not for consumption.

408
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,070
Not for consumption.

409
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:39,770

412
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:25,030
That's crazy.

413
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,830
That's crazy.

414
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:34,470
You literally, yeah, I hit my foot.

415
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,930
It's all bloody right now.

416
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:36,570
I'll show you.

417
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,390
It's red and bloody.

418
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:39,770
Ah,

419
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,700
it burns!

420
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,850
Okay, wait, let me look at Doki now.

421
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,690
Okay, well, you guys don't know what I'm making Doki.

422
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,450
Wait, actually, I just realized.

423
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,250
I just realized something.

424
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:05,850
Hold on.

425
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,450
I just realized something.

426
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,260
Oh, thank goodness they fit.

427
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,220
Oh, okay, okay.

428
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,300
I was worried.

429
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:39,980
But

430
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
it kind of looks like a ghost.

431
00:33:45,340 --> 00:34:17,460
right now no okay um you guys then will have to guess what costume what halloween what her halloween costume is okay um let's see uh okay let's start with her hair right so i have some i think as soon as i brought this out you guys would probably know who it is so no you can't guess yet you can't guess yet okay oh gosh the sound is so much easier in my brain.

432
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,720
I was like, oh, I'll just cut out her hair.

433
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,200
You know what?

434
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,680
I will do that.

435
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,760
In fact, I will just cut out her hair.

436
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:27,920
Okay.

437
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:28,780
Alright.

438
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,740
We're going to do the front and the back.

439
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,460
Okay.

440
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:45,320
I'm just going to outline it as I see it on her reference photo, and then I'll cut that and glue it on her head.

441
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,200
Okay, okay.

442
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,040
Good, good, good.

443
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,420
Good, good, good.

444
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,340
Oh, wait, I need to glue these together.

445
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,840
I need to glue this.

446
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,140
Okay, hold on.

447
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,380
I need to probably make this inside out, right?

448
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,440
This still works, right?

449
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,820
Yeah, yeah, okay, good.

450
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,620
I'm testing if I can get in here.

451
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:17,900
Okay.

452
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,500
Oh no, guys!

453
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,200
Wait.

454
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,940
It's okay.

455
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,100
I'll just have...

456
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,980
I'll just leave one bigger flat.

457
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,460
How much of this is you winging it?

458
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,020
Like, the whole thing.

459
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,060
That's flat and white.

460
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,120
Is she beat down?

461
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,620
No!

462
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,360
Doki is also flat.

463
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,620
What are you talking about?

464
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,860
Okay, wait.

465
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,700
We're going to wing the whole thing.

466
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,180
thing.

467
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,820
We're doing it live, folks.

468
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,080
We're doing it live.

469
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,250
Okay, it's not hot enough.

470
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,110
Okay, it is on.

471
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,770
Oh, it wasn't in.

472
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,990
This wasn't in.

473
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:18,570
Okay.

474
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,470
It wasn't getting, it wasn't glue.

475
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,230
That's why.

476
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,850
It wasn't melting, I mean.

477
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,030
It's too big.

478
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,350
Stop it right here.

479
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:35,790
I have a gun and I will shoot if you keep making fun of me, I will shoot.

480
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,710
You didn't hear that YouTube.

481
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,170
It's a glue gun.

482
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,450
It's a glue gun?

483
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:46,510
Ouch.

484
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,910
Oh, oh, oh, here it comes.

485
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:56,030
Maybe I should have done sockpucket puppets, not pockets, sorry.

486
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,700
What's wrong with me?

487
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,560
Okay, okay.

488
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:30,420
We're fine.

489
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,640
Everything's good.

490
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:42,470
You want the secret with hot glue is you gotta get it and then glue it.

491
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:47,810
Mint with a gun doesn't exist.

492
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:50,330
I have no trigger discipline either!

493
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,040
Oh, I need another stick.

Okay, hold on.

497
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,680
Let me just try and get my hand in here.

498
00:38:58,730 --> 00:38:59,130
Yes!

499
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,290
It works.

500
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:02,070
Oh my gosh, this is gonna be so good.

501
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:04,090
This is gonna be so good.

502
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,730
Time for hair!

503
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,910
Okay.

504
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,790
I'm measuring.

505
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,060
Whatever.

506
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,980
We wing it.

507
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,280
Ah!

508
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:16,780
Ah!

509
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,360
I dropped my pen.

510
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,100
Okay, we're fine.

511
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,700
Oh my gosh, we are so back.

512
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,440
We are so back.

513
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,340
Trust the process!

514
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,040
The keyboard and desk mat colorway goes crazy.

515
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:28,860
This?

516
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:29,680
I know.

517
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,480
I know.

518
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,940
You seemed confident at first.

519
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Why'd we stop that?

520
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,440
I don't know.

521
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,380
I don't know.

522
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,340
I don't know.

523
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,840
Okay, I'm just gonna do like a small chunk of her.

524
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,280
Okay, I'm gonna try and not make it too wide.

525
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,420
Actually!

526
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,580
That kind of fits.

527
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,680

528
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,640

529
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,020

530
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:31,020

531
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:40,820

532
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,100

Trust the process.

534
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,360
Trust the process.

535
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,400
Trust the process.

536
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:52,860
Uh-oh, I think I- I'm too far over.

537
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:00,750
Who else needs yellow?

538
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,290
Hold on, I'm checking my list.

539
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,870
I'm checking it twice.

540
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:15,790
Only- Doki.

541
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:18,990

00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,100
Okay, trust the process.

544
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,880
We'll just do one single in the middle.

545
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,740
Okay, trust the process.

546
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,760
Okay, trust the process.

547
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,060
Trust the process.

548
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,920
This is going to look so stinking cute and good.

549
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,240
Oops, I messed up.

550
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:52,840
That's fine.

551
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,460
It's just dope.

552
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,540
She's our first one.

553
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,120
It's kind of hard to draw this.

554
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,180
Oh, wait.

555
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,720
Why does she look like Joey Wheeler or something?

556
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:16,040
I gotta get up and pace around the house about this for like five minutes.

557
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:16,540
Why?

558
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,060
Stop!

559
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,720
Don't leave!

560
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,340
Don't leave!

561
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,040
Where's my scissors?

562
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,020
Oh.

563
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:25,980
Okay.

564
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,260
Trust?

565
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,840
No, process.

566
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,900
Okay.

567
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,480
I can't unsee it.

568
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:34,840
Okay.

569
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,480
What if I made it too small?

570
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,560
No, it's not possible.

571
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,920
It's not possible.

572
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,240
Don't even bring that up.

573
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,400
Why would you bring...

574
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,460
Why would you bring that up?

575
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,140
Okay.

576
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,370
Why am I cute?

577
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:58,730

586
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,150
Okay, this part's hard.

589
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:11,650
Okay.

590
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,490
I think I messed it up.

591
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,530
I think I messed it up, but that's okay.

592
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:29,410
Hmm.

593
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:35,270
I figured because my song is a little spooky, I could use it as Halloween BJM.

594
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:35,830
Is that okay?

595
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:41,450
I checked your merch store.

596
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,050
Oh, I can't find it.

597
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:44,690
New merch.

598
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:49,350
I posted a community post about it.

599
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:56,670
So, if you're looking for a direct link to it, you can go to the community post on YouTube.

600
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,930
Thanks for asking.

601
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:07,250
I hope this isn't too small.

602
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:09,510
I'm really scared, you guys.

603
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,150
You guys, I'm scared.

604
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:13,710
I'm scared.

605
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:16,610
What if it's too small for her head?

606
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,910
You think I made it all right?

607
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,290
We're winging it?

608
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,170
We're winging it.

609
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:29,530
Okay.

610
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,710
Moment of truth.

611
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:32,230
Moment of truth in coming.

612
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:33,870
I don't think so.

613
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:35,190
I'm gonna be able to make everybody.

614
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:35,690
We'll see.

615
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,910
I'm kind of slow.

616
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,850
All right, moment of truth!

617
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:41,970
Okay, thanks!

618
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,570
Thank you!

619
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,350
Thank you guys for all the super chats I really, really appreciate.

00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:49,270
Thank you too, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

621
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,050
Thank you, thank you!

622
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,090
Okay, here we go.

623
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:56,550
She dropped an eye.

624
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:58,950
Okay, we'll get the full effect.

625
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,600
Okay, ready?

626
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,940
Ready for the hair?

627
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,280
I'm

628
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,340
scared.

629
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,920
I might be a genius.

630
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:31,620
Oh.

631
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,640
Oh my god.

632
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,700
I might be a genius.

633
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,260
And then this can be like her...

634
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:38,920
Okay, hold on.

635
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,300
Hold on.

636
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:44,730
This piece.

637
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:45,610
Right here.

638
00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:47,410
Wait, I'll cut it nicer.

639
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:50,330
She has one, right?

640
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:51,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:51,630
She does.

642
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:51,890
She does.

643
00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:52,630
Oh, this part.

644
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:53,570
Right there.

645
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:57,390
Why did I cut it so small?

646
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:00,330
Oh, well, I need to cut it much smaller anyway.

647
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:03,670
It's fine, it's fine.

648
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:04,950
Like so.

649
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:05,850
Sorry.

650
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:07,890

00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:43,330
this part.

656
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:44,850
The Ahogi first.

657
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,570
Sorry, the lighting is kind of strange with Doki.

658
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:55,620
Okay.

659
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:56,720
That should be good.

660
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,280
Oh, out!

661
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:58,060
Out, out, out, out.

662
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,140
Uncanny resemblance.

663
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:00,760

664
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,840

Oh, my gosh.

Totally love the mixed part of the song.

667
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,000
But there are parts I can't make out.

668
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,960
What does it say?

669
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,320
It says... In English or Japanese?

670
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,440

Her hair.

Wait.

684
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:16,800
Okay.

Like so.

00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:18,540
Okay, perfect.

687
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,820
Perfect.

688
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:20,400
Perfect.

689
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,620
I don't know where to glue.

690
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,220
I guess everywhere.

691
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:29,620
I just gotta make sure it doesn't...

692
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,000
Oh gosh.

693
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:31,380
There we go.

694
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:33,860
Okay.

695
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:34,420
I'm scared.

696
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:37,960
Did I get it?

697
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,300
I think so.

698
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,760
Okay.

699
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:42,880
Alright.

700
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,060
I might be a genius for real.

701
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,180
Wait, let me go back to...

702
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:54,380
Okay.

703
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,140
Okay.

704
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,480
But there's still more hair.

705
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,080
There's still more hair.

706
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,860
That we need to take care of.

707
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,100
So...

708
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:03,760
Okay.

709
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:15,460
But, wait, I can, I can, I can, uh, I can, uh, draw her face.

710
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,920
Yeah, her costume.

711
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:21,720
Alright,

712
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,070
you guys ready?

713
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:30,030
You probably will guess what she is after I do this.

714
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,350
She's Doki the Werecat!

715
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:58,110
Don't kitty!

716
00:51:58,610 --> 00:51:58,950
Don't kitty!

717
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:01,790
Actually, so now we need to make kitty ears.

718
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:06,530
She's donky the wear cat!

719
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,390
So, like, this size?

720
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:13,130
Should be good.

721
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:16,250
Should be good.

722
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:18,490
Okay, hold on.

723
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,190
Oh, you know what?

724
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,310
I can wing it.

725
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,230
I can wing it.

726
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:24,130
I can wing it.

727
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,870
I can wing it.

728
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,700
Like so?

729
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:32,580
Wait, hold on.

730
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,500
We're going to make them ultra-detailed.

731
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,980
I'm a perfectionist.

732
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,680
Look at that fluff tuft.

733
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,220
Look at that.

734
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,500
Oh!

735

00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:49,400
Wait.

737
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,700
I guess I just have to glue it to the back.

738
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,260
Yes.

739
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:58,580
Okay.

740
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,540
I glue it to the back.

741
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,250
Plenty of glue

00:53:09,850 --> 00:53:18,470

746
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,000
I'm going to Akihabara today.

747
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,700
Any suggestions on where to go for cool stuff?

748
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,740
Thank you in advance.

749
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:53,380
What kind of cool stuff?

750
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,040
Doki no Ushimaki.

751
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,960
We'll do her Ahogi.

752
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,260
She has two of them, so...

753
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:14,970
I really want to get through the ones that I bought all this stuff for today, but even though Then I had to cut somebody out because I was like, there's no way.

754
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:17,210
I think I was a little ambitious.

755
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,530
I was like, yeah, let's go.

756
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,850
I could do everybody in the world.

757
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:25,730
Let's go.

758
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,710
I thought I was a little ambitious.

759
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:32,370
I love crafty minnow.

760
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:36,850
Thank you.

761
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:41,070
There we go.

762
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:45,550
Is that a seal?

763
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,910
No, it's Doki.

764
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:49,130
It's Doki bird.

765
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,450
This one.

766
00:54:54,830 --> 00:55:06,950
I wish I had, I intended originally to have a little bit of the, what's it called, the head lobotomized so that I could stick things in there.

767
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:09,030
But, guys.

768
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,190
Oh my gosh.

769
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,570
Okay, this one's gonna burn.

770
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:18,670
This one's gonna burn my newly discovered flesh today.

771
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,170
All right, here I go.

772
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:23,230
Burning for you, baby.

773
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:27,190
Wait.

774
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:37,360
Oh my gosh, that hurt way more than I thought.

775
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,660
Humans are so fragile.

776
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:47,000
Looks just like her.

777
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:47,920
Oh wait.

778
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,040
This is- this will help, this will help, this will help.

779
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:56,480
This will help.

780
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:02,470
There you go!

781
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:03,790
There you go.

782
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,510
There you go.

783
00:56:15,270 --> 00:56:16,890
Stop saying Joey Wheeler.

784
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:18,890
Because I know you're right.

785
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:22,770
Stop saying Joey Wheeler.

786
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,730
You're making me feel bad.

787
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,170
I'm making the other Ahoy Garen now.

788
00:56:35,800 --> 00:57:17,020
I don't have to do maybe she can be naked on the back from the front all you need to see is from the front anyway right oh I should have glued both at the same time oh wait it's still it's wait it's still I love arts and crafts during Halloween time you guys it's why I always tend to do Halloween arts and crafts stuff I don't know it always reminds me of just like I don't know being a kid I thought Doki was streaming when did this become a collab wait

789
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:33,770
wow wait oh synapse thank you so much for the Akasupa yeah

790
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:53,270
perfect Okay, now she looks like she's giving me sass right now.

791
00:57:53,850 --> 00:58:01,030
Okay, now we need to do the back of her hair, which I guess we don't have to make her bald, but she's definitely going to be naked on her back, probably.

792
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:14,040
We'll probably do like a kind of a big swoopy here, which I could probably reuse this, maybe.

793
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:17,820
Nah, that's fine.

794
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:19,960
Like I said, I don't need any more yellow.

795
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,000
Let's clean up a little bit.

796
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,520
All trash goes on the plate.

797
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:26,380
Oh!

798
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,340
Her other ear!

799
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,440
Oh my gosh.

800
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:33,760
I almost left her with just one ear.

801
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:40,290
Oh.

802
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:42,050
Why did I just wing it?

803
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:45,170
I'm getting marker on me!

804
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:03,230
Is this the same?

805
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:20,410

807
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:45,900
Okay, okay, okay, okay, nice, okay.

808
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,280
Love your rendition of Snaking Up on Mouse?

809
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,860
Why were the subtitles like that?

810
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,160
Why?

811
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:58,820
They were so goofy!

812
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:09,770
too good okay

813
01:00:16,250 --> 01:01:05,830
to be fair triangles on your ghost headpiece are kind of the same true okay now let's wing it okay so I said it was gonna be like a flippy okay it's got to be flippy and then oh my gosh um gift hire me for your food right now I have a hidden talent that must be recognized guys I'm opening up I'm opening up what's the words pre-order no commissions today for plushies okay

814
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:13,950
Uh, okay.

815
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:20,570
I want it really like that, you know?

816
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,400
Oh, I went too far, I think.

817
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,040
Wait.

818
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,640
Did I go far enough?

819
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,560
We'll figure it out.

820
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:31,300
We'll find out.

821
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:33,840
Okay.

822
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:40,260
We'll figure it out.

823
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:41,800
I'll give it a little extra room.

824
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:44,800
I think.

825
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,200
I think...

826
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,100
I think it's okay.

827
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:52,600
I think it's fine.

828
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:53,140
Oh gosh.

829
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:13,490
One of my favorite parts about the lyrics of the song...

830
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:15,990
Is...

831
01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:16,730
There's one...

832
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,490
So the first part is...

833
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,590
Saying I will cast like a magic spell on you.

834
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,190
And then it says I will kill you myself.

835
01:02:25,310 --> 01:02:25,850
And the...

836
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,410
Did we did?

837
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:27,070
Flushy!

838
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:27,830
Yeah!

839
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:29,470
How dare you go to the...

840
01:02:29,490 --> 01:03:00,070
kickabout other girls in front of me um please read the rules no mentioning other vtubers unless i mention them first thank you um what was i saying oh and so it says i'll cast a magic spell on you and then it says i will kill you but then the second part is saying i will i will um cast a curse on you and it says i will make you happy so it's kind of like subverting you know because you're like,

841
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:01,110
oh, magic spell!

842
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,530
And then it's, I'll kill you.

843
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,710
And then it's like, oh, you'll make me happy.

844
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:06,030
It's a curse.

845
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,570
Okay, this part's a little annoying.

846
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:14,530
I'm not going to lie.

847
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:15,970
Doki, stop.

848
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:16,930
Go bald.

849
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,490
Go bald, Doki bird.

850
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,070
Go bald right now.

851
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:22,590
Go bald, I dare you.

852
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:24,250
I dare you right now.

853
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,790
Go bald.

854
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:25,430
Go bald.

855
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,930
Maybe I'll just make a couple of them.

856
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,990
Or...

857
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:32,770
Help, help.

858
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:36,630
Well, it's only been an hour, but I'm still pretty far from completing Doki.

859
01:03:37,270 --> 01:03:37,870
We'll see how...

860
01:03:38,570 --> 01:03:39,870
Maybe I can get like...

861
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:42,430
Two.

862
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:43,630
Three.

863
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:44,270
Done.

864
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:48,730
You said Doki naked on the back, killed 100 jikus.

865
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:55,930
Thank you for using my art as a thumbnail!

866
01:03:57,770 --> 01:03:58,370
Thank you!

867
01:03:58,510 --> 01:03:59,930
It's so cute art!

868
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,050
Thank you!

869
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:02,610
Thank you so much!

870
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:05,610
Froegert.

871
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,250
What's Froegert?

872
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,710
Thank you for threatening my life.

873
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:12,250
At least three times this stream.

874
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,230
Yeah, this one's for you, Grupple.

875
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:21,370
My Fumo idea is a sloppy sister's collection.

876
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,330
That would be fun.

877
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:26,010
I also wanted to do, like, Phoebe and Vicky.

878
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,390
But I was like, wait, I can't do Vicky.

879
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:34,610
You guys kind of know what she looks like, but not enough where I feel like I can make a plushie of her.

880
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:37,690
without giving away too many things, you know, so...

881
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:43,880
Okay.

882
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:44,480
Ugh.

883
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:51,910
Oh, it's not so bad!

884
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:54,730
But you can't see it because...

885
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:55,390
You can't see her...

886
01:04:55,390 --> 01:04:57,650
Maybe when I, like, put my hands down, you'll see it.

887
01:04:58,070 --> 01:04:58,450
You know?

888
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,690
Wait, actually, it's way too small.

889
01:05:00,770 --> 01:05:01,970
Wait, I can fix it.

890
01:05:03,230 --> 01:05:04,450
I can fix it.

891
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,130
I can fix it.

892
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:05,750
I can fix it.

893
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:06,750
I can fix it.

894
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,770
Am I allowed to mention the fabulous and amazing Vithubr...

895
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:11,230
Vithubr and Tobe on this stream?

896
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:12,470
Where?

897
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:13,470
Where is she?

898
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:21,350
That's me looking around single action safety lock scissors.

899
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,130
Okay.

900
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,530
How much thicker does this need to be?

901
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:37,790
Okay, like here.

902
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:39,550
I had it here.

903
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:40,650
It needs to be like here.

904
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:51,290
We're good.

905
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:51,810
We're good.

906
01:05:52,350 --> 01:05:52,850
Everything's okay.

907
01:05:53,370 --> 01:05:54,110
We can fix.

908
01:05:55,130 --> 01:05:55,770
We...

909
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,770
I'm basically... I'm possessing somebody.

910
01:05:57,970 --> 01:05:59,030
I'm possessing a human.

911
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:00,930
I'm basically alive right now.

912
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:08,190
Which means I can say I live and I adapt.

913
01:06:10,650 --> 01:06:11,270
Pretty much.

914
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,690
Is that the saying?

915
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,590
Or is there a saying like that?

916
01:06:18,830 --> 01:06:21,610
Is there a saying... Okay, I messed up her hair a little bit.

917
01:06:22,130 --> 01:06:24,150
She's got a bad haircut right there.

918
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:57,890
But, um... Wait, I could just flip it around but then you see oh wait she has a bald spot there too okay wait she has a couple bald spots oh no it has to be the side she has a couple bald spots but you know don't bring it up she's very self-conscious about it oh it's actually it works though no i think it works It's fine,

919
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,990
it doesn't have to be perfect.

920
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:01,350
This is...

921
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:01,950
shading.

922
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:04,510
And stuff.

923
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:05,210
You know?

924
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:19,350
It's like the shading of her hair or something.

925
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:22,970
Bolding Doki.

926
01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:25,170
Yeah, don't tell her.

927
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:28,770
Don't tell her.

928
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,770
Oh, that's just...

929
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:34,130
The person you possessed has such cute hands.

930
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:36,110
Oh my gosh, you think so?

931
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:39,070
You think so?

932
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:40,510
You think they're cute?

933
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:45,430
Okay!

934
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:48,490
Very good.

935
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:50,270
Now let's make...

936
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:52,610
Um...

937
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,370
Well, it's wear...

938
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:54,630
Okay.

939
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:57,430
It's wear, don't kiddies.

940
01:07:57,630 --> 01:07:59,230
So, here's the vision.

941
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:01,930
Wait, but I bought that color for her shirt.

942
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:02,870
What was I thinking?

943
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:19,570
for her shirt but it's fine it's fine um hair jacket hair because she's all because she's a furry

944
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:41,400
okay good i'm glad we're on the same page okay i'm glad we're on the same page Wait!

945
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:43,360
Oh my gosh, what if I do this?

946
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,700
See how it's, like, kind of fuzzy?

947
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,440
I'm innovating right now.

948
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:53,880
I'm innovating?

949
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:00,980
Tease it out!

950
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,440
Wait, is this enough?

951
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,500
Yeah, I think because then we can have the jacket go like this.

952
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,400
Let me cut it first.

953
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:16,820
And I'm even...

954
01:09:16,820 --> 01:09:19,040
Look at me reusing my pieces.

955
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,180
You guys are gonna get sick of this song.

956
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:49,540
Okay,

957
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,340
this is hard work, you guys.

958
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,300
How can I fuzz her out faster?

959
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:09,220
Do you guys want to see my...

960
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:10,640
My...

961
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:12,200
Um...

962
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,940
Hold on.

963
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:15,340
Look at how cute this is.

964
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,220
This is my bag of...

965
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:20,100
throat stuff.

966
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,180
So...

967
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,220
We have some...

968
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:26,680
Uh...

969
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:27,120
No doame.

970
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:28,340
What is it?

971
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:28,920
What's that?

972
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,180
Uh...

973
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:32,700
What is it called?

974
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:33,700
Uh...

975
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,160
Pop drops!

976
01:10:41,400 --> 01:10:41,820
Thank you.

977
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:47,740
Now we have my favorite, my super o susume, my super recommendation.

978
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,500
Mintia plus voice.

979
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:50,800
They taste delicious.

980
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:51,740
They're lemon ginger.

981
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:52,420
They're good.

982
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:53,640
Okay, this is why they're...

983
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,280
This is why they're the best.

984
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,220
One, they're good for your throat.

985
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:00,020
Two, it has ginger in it.

986
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,900
So, when I...

987
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,120
When I've...

988
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:07,780
Several times people have been like, Oh, I...

989
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:08,880
I...

990
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,280
I'm feeling kind of like car sick or something.

991
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,300
I'll give them this because the ginger will help them from stopping nauseous.

992
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:18,980
It's so good.

993
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,460
It's so good.

994
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:21,540
Would you say, Mimi?

995
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:24,040
I'll never forget you saving me at Off-Kai with those.

996
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,740
They're so, so delicious.

997
01:11:26,180 --> 01:11:27,800
These are my super dao susume.

998
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:29,360
Mintia voice.

999
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,640
And then, of course, another big recommendation.

1000
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:33,840
Da-da.

1001
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:35,700
The pei pakko.

1002
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:36,840
Koa.

1003
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,120
And then I have another.

1004
01:11:39,140 --> 01:12:06,620
one and then I have another one and then I have this one is just candy and then I have a throat coat this one I also like the throat coat I know I've tried the throat coat tea and it's kind of like in but this is the throat coat cough drop is really good this is my bag but this one is just

1005
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,600
Regular candy, yeah.

1006
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:14,700
Everything else?

1007
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:16,860
Stuff it in here.

1008
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,620
Yeah, isn't it so cute?

1009
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,340
It's my bag of throat stuff.

1010
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:28,800
I especially take it when I'm traveling.

1011
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,840
And so if I'm recording at a studio or something, I have everything I need in here.

1012
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:45,610
Oh yeah.

1013
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:46,990
We were fuzzing her out.

1014
01:12:48,650 --> 01:12:50,110
Maybe if I, like, scratch her.

1015
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,080
Use the edge of the scissors and scrape it across the fabric.

1016
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,340
I'm scared.

1017
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,560
I'm kind of scared.

1018
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,580
These are really, these are fabric scissors, so they're very sharp.

1019
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:12,240
I only use them for, like, when I'm, I used to make cosplay a little bit.

1020
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,080
And...

1021
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,810
Oh, yeah, that is helping.

1022
01:13:18,910 --> 01:13:19,370
That is helping.

1023
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:20,950
I don't know if you guys can tell, though.

1024
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:29,390
Wait, hold on.

1025
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:30,330
I'm gonna...

1026
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,110
Snip.

1027
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:39,520
Do you have any Velcro?

1028
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:42,380
Yes!

1029
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,380
Yes, I do!

1030
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:45,900
Oh my gosh, wait, I have it right here!

1031
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,620
Because I had like a cable organizer.

1032
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,120
Oh wait, I don't think it'll work.

1033
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:50,520
Oh yes!

1034
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:51,360
It does!

1035
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,820
Good idea, good idea!

1036
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,080
Oh yeah!

1037
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:57,900
Oh yeah!

1038
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:04,650
Could I borrow your scissors for...

1039
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:05,090
Oh no!

1040
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:05,950
No!

1041
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,770
Wait, I don't know.

01:14:46,350 --> 01:14:48,330

1046
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:55,700
Okay.

1047
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,080
Alright, this is good enough.

1048
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,500
Alright, so we do this and then we make her jacket.

1049
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,100
And then...

1050
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:03,960
Do-kitty should be done.

1051
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,660
Where do-kitty should...

1052
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:05,800
Oh!

1053
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:06,120

What's happening?

1058
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:08,040
Oh!

1059
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,060
I think...

1060
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:11,560
I think it glued a little.

1061
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:12,560
We're okay.

1062
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:30,540
Alright, that should be enough.

1063
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:41,570
Yes.

1064
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:44,830
This song is so cute, what's it called?

1065
01:15:46,230 --> 01:15:48,130
It's called Spooky Pokey.

1066
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:52,390
Spooky Pokey.

1067
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:58,350
Okay, jacket time.

1068
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:00,630
Wait, hold on, I got some string on me.

1069
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,170
It feels like, it feels like, what's it called?

1070
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,070
Um...

1071
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:08,430
What's it called?

1072
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,130
Oh, Spiderweb, you know?

1073
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:11,450
Okay.

1074
01:16:12,370 --> 01:16:13,690
Let me get my black.

Oh, I also, I also got like, what's it called too?

1076

I don't know if I'll ever need them.

1077
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,090
I got cotton, the...

1078
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:23,970
Not cotton balls.

1079
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:28,530
The...

1080
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,490
Pompoms.

1081
01:16:30,290 --> 01:16:32,830
I want to know how I can I use it, I wonder.

1082
01:16:33,110 --> 01:16:34,390
Wait a second, I have an idea.

1083
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:35,830
I have an idea.

1084
01:16:39,150 --> 01:16:41,230
What if it's like little blush?

1085
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:42,130
Wait!

1086
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:43,730
Wait!

1087
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:48,530
Wait, it's kind of so cute.

1088
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,190
Hold on, I'm trying to find another pink one.

1089
01:17:01,990 --> 01:17:03,230
Trying to find another pink one.

1090
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:05,250
Oh, there we go.

1091
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:11,120
It's so cute!

1092
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:17,540
Wait, and then I got some, some of these, uh, these, these bad boys.

1093
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:18,740
What do you call these?

1094
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:23,480
These pipes, but I don't know what to use them for yet.

1095
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:24,640
I just have them.

1096
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:29,060
I went, I went to the total craft store and I said, your crafts.

1097
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:30,460
Pipe cleaners!

1098
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,440
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1099
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:32,200
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1100
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,320
Maybe we'll save this for last.

1101
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:39,100
This will be the grand finale.

1102
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:41,460
Okay.

1103
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:43,920
Let's make a jacket.

1104
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:44,480
Okay.

1105
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:49,630
How?

1106
01:17:51,390 --> 01:17:53,070
How do I do that?

1107
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,150
Oh, I'm kidding.

1108
01:18:00,230 --> 01:18:01,750
I keep giving myself more room.

1109
01:18:02,750 --> 01:18:03,370
There we go.

1110
01:18:05,930 --> 01:18:08,270
Cats need collars, don't they?

1111
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,720
It kind of looks like she has a giant goatee right now.

1112
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,300
Like, she kind of looks like Guy Fieri.

1113
01:18:25,140 --> 01:18:27,900
They're also decently good for cleaning reusable straws.

1114
01:18:27,980 --> 01:18:29,060
No way, really.

1115
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,460
For you, then welcome to Mephushab the Anchor.

1116
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,560
Okay, how do I do this?

1117
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:47,260
Oh no, she's starting to look like Dracula.

1118
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,700
Furry Dracula.

1119
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,060
What kind of keyboard do you use?

1120
01:18:51,220 --> 01:18:52,160
I love how it sounds.

1121
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,020
Oh gosh.

1122
01:18:55,420 --> 01:18:58,740
Every now and then somebody asks me about this, but I...

1123
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,860
I don't remember.

1124
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:05,100
I said it like one time on a membership stream.

1125
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:06,720
Okay.

1126
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:37,340
calmo if you check the membership stream where i am typing you'll you'll you'll find it where i i think i even put it in the description wait i could just check that if i put it in the description i'm not saying you should draw a butt crack on the back like here wow she looks really naked suddenly i feel like i need to sense Okay,

1127
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:37,840
hold on.

1128
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:46,570
One second, one second, one second.

1129
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:56,690
Hold on.

1130
01:19:57,910 --> 01:19:58,550
Live.

1131
01:19:59,250 --> 01:19:59,770
Okay, hold on.

1132
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:03,350
Can I org us by...

1133
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:04,870
No.

1134
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:05,830
Wait, visibility.

1135
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:06,330
Visibility?

1136
01:20:06,910 --> 01:20:07,670
Would that be members?

1137
01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:08,250
Yes, okay.

1138
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:08,930
Apply.

1139
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:10,590
Okay.

1140
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:18,750
Huh?

1141
01:20:19,170 --> 01:20:20,050
Wait, where was it?

1142
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:22,270
Was it this Membouz test stream?

1143
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,230
You're upstream!

1144
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:28,930
Now, what color are the scissors?

1145
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,150
Oh, this was from an hour ago.

1146
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:34,210
Stop!

1147
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:39,920
Mako's K99!

1148
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:40,400
Yeah!

1149
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:46,040
M-M-Ko's K99 keyboard.

1150
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,360
Doki's iconic dumpy.

1151
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:50,540
Yeah, that she totally, totally had.

1152
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:51,340
Yeah.

1153
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,240
Wait, where did I do this stream, though?

1154
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,520
Where did I do this one?

1155
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:14,430
Oh, I found it.

1156
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,890
I found it.

1157
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,210
I didn't ride it.

1158
01:21:18,370 --> 01:21:19,410
I'm the worst.

1159
01:21:21,630 --> 01:21:22,650
But that's the one.

1160
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:23,910
Where did it go?

1161
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:26,070
Hold on.

1162
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,460
You're pretty good.

1163
01:21:41,430 --> 01:21:42,770
I can't find it.

1164
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:43,210
Oh, wait.

1165
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:43,890
I found it.

1166
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:51,070
I'm gonna put it in the description.

1167
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:55,470
Maybe I tagged it or pinned it.

1168
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:57,170
Okay, anyway, sorry, I'm getting all distracted.

1169
01:21:57,790 --> 01:21:59,030
Okay, okay, jacket time.

1170
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,950
Jacket time.

1171
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,370
She looks like a vampire!

1172
01:22:12,970 --> 01:22:15,550
She looks like a vampire!

1173
01:22:18,410 --> 01:22:19,530
Oh no!

1174
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:38,720
It's...

1175
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,280
I know what you are.

1176
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:41,580
Say it.

1177
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:51,340
We could also put like... we could put the blue underneath That I have that I got for her I could just do that

1178
01:23:00,620 --> 01:23:03,620
Spider monkey hold on spider monkey.

1179
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:12,800
Oh, I almost just cut my fingers off Um, okay, let's do this I'll cut a straight line.

1180
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,960
That wasn't bad!

1181
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:19,240
It's a little crooked.

1182
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:21,300
It's mostly straight!

1183
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:26,780
Alright, so this will be for the bottom of her jacket.

1184
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:28,780
Like this.

1185
01:23:29,960 --> 01:23:31,660
And also her sleeves.

1186
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:43,380
Do you have a beauty mark?

1187
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:44,440
No, I have...

1188
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,520
I have Sharpie.

1189
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:50,240
I have Sharpie on my head.

1190
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:05,860
But I have a couple on my booty.

1191
01:24:14,230 --> 01:24:16,910
Okay, so I'm trying to get like the shape now.

1192
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:21,730
So if I do it like this, maybe.

1193
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,790
Okay, if I glue it like this.

1194
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:37,670
I'm doing the out Like this maybe Okay, I know it's black And the felt is black too But it might show up

1196
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:54,010

01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:02,010
My booty I have a reference sheet Yosei I see it right there.

1198
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:06,750
I promise you, they're there on my reference sheet.

1199
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:09,670
There we go.

1200
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:09,930
Okay.

1201
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,510
I'm very serious about this craft.

1202
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:16,210
Can you guys tell?

1203
01:25:18,870 --> 01:25:20,810
I think so far it's coming out pretty good.

1204
01:25:20,910 --> 01:25:21,690
What do you guys think?

1205
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,450
What do you guys think?

1206
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:32,980
Okay.

1207
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:37,300
Now, I'm gonna cut over here.

1208
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:42,610
Like that.

1209
01:25:42,890 --> 01:25:42,890
Okay.

1210
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,250
Then...

1211
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,450
It's easier to cut.

1212
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:50,470
Okay.

1213
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:52,670
Alright.

1214
01:25:53,790 --> 01:25:54,070
Okay.

1215
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:54,530
Okay.

1216
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,990
I'm scared!

1217
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:00,790
What if I glue it now?

1218
01:26:01,790 --> 01:26:02,330
You know?

1219
01:26:03,030 --> 01:26:03,950
What if I glue it now?

1220
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:04,190
Wait.

1221
01:26:04,570 --> 01:26:04,950
Well...

1222
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:06,010
Nah, it's okay.

1223
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:07,730
Alright.

1224
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,770
I cut.

1225
01:26:10,910 --> 01:26:11,530
I cut.

1226
01:26:11,690 --> 01:26:11,950
I cut.

1227
01:26:15,170 --> 01:26:17,430
I can kind of see it.

1228
01:26:18,710 --> 01:26:20,070
Wait, I can't see it.

1229
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:21,090
Maybe.

1230
01:26:21,670 --> 01:26:22,050
Uh-oh.

1231
01:26:22,570 --> 01:26:22,970
Yes?

1232
01:26:25,610 --> 01:26:26,630
Uh-oh.

1233
01:26:27,670 --> 01:26:28,350
Wait.

1234
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:32,890
I think it's here.

1235
01:26:34,290 --> 01:26:35,410
I think I see.

1236
01:26:36,950 --> 01:26:37,790
I think I see.

1237
01:26:44,590 --> 01:26:45,270
Oops.

1238
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:48,370
Whatever.

1239
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,810
Don't worry about it.

1240
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:52,610
She's... she's...

1241
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:55,470
We're do-kitty, so it can be a little frayed, you know?

1242
01:26:56,650 --> 01:26:57,130
Okay!

1243
01:26:57,830 --> 01:26:59,410
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1244
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:06,790
The vision is visioning!

1245
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:07,970
I know, I know!

1246
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:08,790
Ah!

1247
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:10,990
Okay, and then a little on...

1248
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:12,270
Okay, let's glue this first.

1249
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:12,790
Wait.

1250
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:16,130
Yeah, because this part will need to be on top here.

1251
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:16,390
Okay.

1252
01:27:17,110 --> 01:27:18,890
Let's glue, let's glue, let's glue...

1253
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:22,730
This glue gun is...

1254
01:27:22,890 --> 01:27:24,890
Could be better.

1255
01:27:25,870 --> 01:27:27,110
Oh gosh.

1256
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:33,310
Get burnt.

1257
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:35,010
Okay.

1258
01:27:35,490 --> 01:27:36,190
Hot dog.

1259
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:37,450
Hot dog indeed!

1260
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,010
Fits for fur?

1261
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:43,190
Okay.

1262
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:48,050
Alright, now we do this part.

1263
01:27:53,570 --> 01:28:00,470
I'm a bit of a perfectionist, which is why it's hard for me to do some of these kinds of streams, you know?

1264
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:03,270
Because I'm like, it's gotta look good!

1265
01:28:04,830 --> 01:28:06,830
Even when it doesn't look good!

1266
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:09,050
Uh oh, wait, did I just mess that up?

1267
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:11,670
Perfect.

1268
01:28:12,470 --> 01:28:12,990
Ish.

1269
01:28:15,630 --> 01:28:16,670
Close enough.

1270
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:17,810
Okay.

1271
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,050
It's coming together, baby!

1272
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,290
She's coming together.

1273
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:42,350
What do you guys think?

1274
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:47,010
Her chest is a little open, but it's okay, probably.

1275
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,270
The process is processing.

1276
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,490
I want more space.

1277
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:56,790
Okay, I'm going to get rid of my keyboard.

1278
01:28:56,990 --> 01:28:57,710
I'm sorry, everybody.

1279
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:02,610
I'm going to get rid of my keyboard.

1280
01:29:05,910 --> 01:29:06,350
Goodbye.

1281
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:16,520
Okay.

1282
01:29:17,660 --> 01:29:18,740
Alright, now we have...

1283
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:19,380
Oh my gosh.

1284
01:29:19,820 --> 01:29:20,860
I have all this space.

1285
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:22,320
Ugh.

1286
01:29:23,940 --> 01:29:24,380
Okay.

1287
01:29:25,340 --> 01:29:25,900
Look at here.

1288
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:32,900
No, well thank you so much for the little toy!

1289
01:29:33,860 --> 01:29:34,480
Thank you!

1290
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:35,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1291
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:38,980
Looks like you buffed Doki's chest.

1292
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:39,980
No, it's hair!

1293
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:43,620
Oh, oops.

1294
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:44,560
That's my webcam.

1295
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:47,440
There we go.

1296
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:50,620
Okay.

1297
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:57,900
Now...

1298
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,380
We do the next part.

1299
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:04,700
Which is...

1300
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:05,280
Check it out!

1301
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:06,560
Thank you so much for the fight!

1302
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:07,040
Get it!

1303
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:07,960
Thank you.

1304
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:09,360
Alright.

1305
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:11,180
Alright.

1306
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,640
Okay, I have to be careful here too.

1307
01:30:19,940 --> 01:30:22,240
We want it the same length, so...

1308
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:34,980
About here, maybe?

1309
01:30:38,060 --> 01:30:51,640

01:31:15,740 --> 01:31:24,460
okay oh wait this one is pretty good actually okay there we go okay Which way does it go?

1312
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:25,300
Oh, this way.

1313
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:29,270
Like so?

1314
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,390
Wait, like...

1315
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:32,490
Like...

1316
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:32,710
Hmm?

1317
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:33,570
Wait.

1318
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:34,970
Wait.

1319
01:31:35,290 --> 01:31:35,310
Hmm?

1320
01:31:35,870 --> 01:31:36,030
Wait.

1321
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:37,410
Wait.

1322
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:39,050
Wait.

1323
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:44,770
Flip it.

1324
01:31:44,930 --> 01:31:46,590
No, it didn't work that way either.

1325
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,710
Wait, it was this way, wasn't it?

1326
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:51,450
Wait.

1327
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:52,750
How did I...

1328
01:31:59,070 --> 01:31:59,530
Wait.

1329
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:05,470
This is the way.

1330
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:08,970
This is, because I see the marking on it.

1331
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:15,310
Whatever!

1332
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:16,190
Whatever!

1333
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:17,070
Whatever!

1334
01:32:17,550 --> 01:32:17,750
Whatever!

1335
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:20,670
Good enough, good enough, good enough, good enough.

1336
01:32:20,690 --> 01:32:21,210
Good enough.

1337
01:32:21,810 --> 01:32:21,990
Good enough.

1338
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:22,190
Good enough.

1339
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,350
Who cares?

1340
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:24,070
Who cares?

1341
01:32:24,390 --> 01:32:24,890
Nobody cares.

1342
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:26,030
Nobody cares.

1343
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:26,510
Nobody cares.

1344
01:32:26,510 --> 01:32:26,910
I don't care.

1345
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,690
Do you care?

1346
01:32:27,930 --> 01:32:28,630
Nobody, nobody cares.

1347
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:31,050
Oops, sorry I punched my mic.

1348
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:31,750
I punched my mic.

1349
01:32:34,950 --> 01:32:35,590
Ew.

1350
01:32:37,190 --> 01:32:40,330
Oh my gosh, it's basically the length I need it to be!

1351
01:32:41,510 --> 01:32:41,850
Wow!

1352
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:45,470
Lucky duckie!

1353
01:32:46,450 --> 01:32:49,010
Okay, let me just trim a teeny tiny bit.

1354
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:53,610
Wow, wow, wow, wow!

1355
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,410
We'll do this side.

1356
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:22,890
Ah!

1357
01:33:23,210 --> 01:33:23,710
Sorry.

1358
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:32,030
Okay, we're fine, everything's fine.

1359
01:33:39,860 --> 01:33:42,320
Something tells me Mint is not an actual phantom.

1360
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,600
Um, what are you talking about?

1361
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:54,420
Uh, if you were, you know, here from earlier, you would know that I literally said I possessed a human today for this stream.

1362
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,860
How does that not make me a real phantom?

1363
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:02,520
In fact, I think that validates my case even more.

1364
01:34:05,860 --> 01:34:12,420
I think that makes me the most phantom because I possess this body that you're seeing.

1365
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,610
But also, I mean, who knows?

1366
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:29,230
Maybe in the future we can get a nice camera that like, like a ghost photography, you know?

1367
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:31,270
But not photography, ghost video.

1368
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:34,230
And you would be able to see me, maybe.

1369
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:52,870
I've had that before in the past where like you know technology will get better but I've had it where you couldn't see me in the past where I was a little see-through but I decided because of this project I wanted to possess somebody to get it done you know hmm

1370
01:34:57,620 --> 01:35:12,660
let's glue glue, glue, glue glue, glue, glue, glue glue, glue, glue, glue, glue, glue okay that should be good enough We're in the question a friend mentioned.

1371
01:35:13,860 --> 01:35:17,000
Being acquainted with a former member of an idol group called Paspo!

1372
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,100
Oh my gosh, whoa.

1373
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:19,420
Paspo.

1374
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:22,800
I haven't heard that group in a long time.

1375
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:23,900
Whoa.

1376
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:26,220
Oh my gosh.

1377
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:28,540
I had a friend that was very into Paspo.

1378
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:30,980
I was never into them so much myself.

1379
01:35:33,560 --> 01:35:35,500
I have string everywhere.

1380
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:39,500
If you still have cookies, maybe another could help you ignore the hot glue.

1381
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,720
I think you're right.

1382
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:47,000
I think you're right.

1383
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:52,440
Are you sure you don't want it?

1384
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:56,340
Kojima is working on the ghost scanning tech.

So she has a collar.

1406
01:40:27,170 --> 01:40:28,870
She's looking at me like, what are you doing?

You are an indoor cat now.

1410
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:39,170
You can't be an outdoor cat.

1411
01:40:39,290 --> 01:40:40,850
The world is scary out there.

1412
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,580
With a leash.

01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,020
Oh my gosh, wait.

Wait, hold on.

1416
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:10,810
This part is poking at me.

1417
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:16,350
It's part of the pipe on her back.

1418
01:41:17,390 --> 01:41:18,850
I just gotta get my nails in there.

1419
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:20,470
This should be better.

1420
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:28,130
Oh, Bito.

1421
01:41:29,070 --> 01:41:29,790

01:41:52,090 --> 01:41:52,110
Q!

1429
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:52,810

1430
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:53,470
Q!

1431
01:41:54,370 --> 01:41:54,710
Q!

1432
01:41:55,390 --> 01:41:57,170
Y, why is only one of her eyes moving?

1433
01:42:01,590 --> 01:42:02,130
Yes.

1434
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:03,210
Yay!

1435
01:42:04,590 --> 01:42:07,190
We completed one puppet!

1436
01:42:07,470 --> 01:42:08,450
How long did that take?

1437
01:42:08,450 --> 01:42:09,990
Only two hours!

1438
01:42:17,370 --> 01:42:17,690
Alright.

1439
01:42:18,850 --> 01:42:19,930
On to the next puppet.

1440
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:22,190
Wait, who should I do though?

1441
01:42:22,730 --> 01:42:24,010
If I can only do two.

1442
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:39,390
Nimi?

1443
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,150
I did have Nimi on my list.

1444
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:43,990
I bought her hair.

1445
01:42:44,250 --> 01:42:44,670
Look at this.

1446
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:46,570
I got like the perfect color for her hair.

1447
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:49,230
It's so perfect.

1448
01:42:49,530 --> 01:42:51,850
I was like, wow, this is Nimi Nightmare hair.

1449
01:42:51,870 --> 01:42:59,270
I got her dress but at the same time I wasn't quite sure

1450
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:24,170
I wasn't quite sure about the costume you guys I have I can't even express to you how much felt I got okay hold on so you see these I'm just gonna keep piling it on I got really ambitious.

1451
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:26,750
I got pretty ambitious.

1452
01:43:27,390 --> 01:43:29,230
I got pretty ambitious.

1453
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:31,890
I got really ambitious.

1454
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:33,970
I thought, I could do this.

1455
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:36,550
I don't even know what that was for, the brown.

1456
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:39,870
I got really ambitious.

1457
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:49,150
And then there's red over there too.

1458
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:51,010
Because I thought about Berry Bud.

1459
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:58,870
I was like, I'm gonna make everybody into a puppet, and then I underestimated how long one puppet would take.

1460
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:04,770
Okay, let's do another one.

1461
01:44:06,810 --> 01:44:10,310
This one, I guess we'll still do this method where I just fold it in half.

1462
01:44:10,870 --> 01:44:11,830
It worked, I think.

1463
01:44:13,770 --> 01:44:16,510
It's okay because the felt was very inexpensive.

1464
01:44:18,250 --> 01:44:21,190
And I can always give it to somebody who does...

1465
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:22,270
What's it called?

1466
01:44:22,510 --> 01:44:23,030
Crafting.

1467
01:44:25,370 --> 01:44:27,750
Hold on, I'm gonna throw away Doki's leftovers.

1468
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:34,540
Are you gonna trace larger this time?

1469
01:44:34,680 --> 01:44:38,180
I don't have so much space, so I'm kind of like...

1470
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,140
I'm kind of like...

1471
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:46,920
Two part of the stream!

1472
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:56,790
I have other Halloween things to do.

1473
01:44:58,530 --> 01:44:59,010
Hahaha.

1474
01:45:05,670 --> 01:45:07,870
Make finger puppets for the others.

1475
01:45:10,590 --> 01:45:11,890
Okay, let's see.

1476
01:45:12,010 --> 01:45:13,990
I did think about doing the sock puppets.

1477
01:45:14,410 --> 01:45:26,930
I was like, but I was like, if I'm making Halloween versions of them, like, if, you know, if I made this, you wouldn't really be able to tell, you know what I mean?

1478
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:31,930
Like, if it were a sock puppet, you wouldn't be able to tell it was wearing.

1479
01:45:31,950 --> 01:45:40,910
kitty so get back over there get back over there oh don't get it where do kitty wants to go for a walk

1480
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:51,280
i feel like i feel like you know those like shiba inu memes where you're just dragging the dog okay

1481
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:07,160
okay but this one came out pretty well so i feel like i'm feeling confident in this one as well all right what i'm gonna do is the bottom is gonna be this entire thing.

1482
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,880
But I just need to trace my hand now.

1483
01:46:27,420 --> 01:46:27,640
Wait.

1484
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:32,340
Oh, it's so hard to stretch my hand!

1485
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:33,760
Okay, okay, okay.

1486
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:36,480
So, we'll start...

1487
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:37,280
We'll do this.

1488
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:42,920
Okay, be careful.

1489
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:43,960
Oh, wait.

1490
01:46:44,200 --> 01:46:45,660
Oh, I'm not just tracing my hand.

1491
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,780
I'm making a person.

1492
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:48,900
Okay, hold on.

1493
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:55,840
Trust the process?

1494
01:46:59,180 --> 01:46:59,660
Yeah!

1495
01:47:08,150 --> 01:47:09,050
Okay, okay.

1496
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:11,790
Okay, okay, okay.

1497
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:15,130
All right, all right.

1498
01:47:15,190 --> 01:47:16,490
I'm gonna know if I guess.

1499
01:47:17,310 --> 01:47:17,810
Look at...

1500
01:47:17,810 --> 01:47:18,670
Damn, girl.

1501
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:20,650
Look at that...

1502
01:47:20,650 --> 01:47:21,410
Look at that...

1503
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:22,650
Look at that body.

1504
01:47:22,970 --> 01:47:23,290
Woo!

1505
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:25,330
She's posing for us.

1506
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:27,450
Looks like she's the dancing queen.

1507
01:47:27,590 --> 01:47:29,110
This is definitely Nemi Nightmare.

1508
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:38,870
I wish though I had some something to...

1509
01:47:38,870 --> 01:47:43,050
I wish I had something though to kind of pin it together.

1510
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:46,070
Actually, hold on.

1511
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:49,330
I'm not going to use these parts, so...

1512
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:52,010
So when I'm cutting...

1513
01:47:52,810 --> 01:47:55,230
When I'm cutting it, it'll still stay together.

1514
01:48:11,630 --> 01:48:12,690
Just a little here too.

1515
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:14,650
Okay.

1516
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,180
I'm winding up the stream.

1517
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:28,180
Get out of my fingers!

1518
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:29,580
Stop being so obsessed with me!

1519
01:48:29,900 --> 01:48:31,340
Alright, let's do this.

1520
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,060
Gingerbread Man.

1521
01:48:43,270 --> 01:48:44,590
The Halloween candy cane.

1522
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:45,870
I'm the...

1523
01:48:45,870 --> 01:48:46,630
This, right?

1524
01:48:47,150 --> 01:48:49,790
Oh my gosh, it's so stinking cute!

1525
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:52,630
I was like, I've never thought of a Halloween candy can.

1526
01:48:54,310 --> 01:48:54,890
Oopsie.

1527
01:48:55,850 --> 01:48:56,430

1538
01:50:31,790 --> 01:50:32,490
Everything's okay.

1539
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,290
Calm down.

1540
01:50:34,330 --> 01:50:34,670

1541
01:50:34,850 --> 01:50:35,110
You're calm?

1542
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:35,710
We're calm.

1543
01:50:35,810 --> 01:50:36,250
We're calm.

1544
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:37,330
Everything's calm.

1545
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:54,140
Yeah.

1546
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:56,000
Okay.

1547
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:59,260
We're calm.

1548
01:50:59,520 --> 01:50:59,760
We're calm.

1549
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:00,400
We're calm.

1550
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:01,220
We're calm.

1551
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:02,880
Calm.

1552
01:51:03,460 --> 01:51:04,120
Keep calm.

1553
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:05,820
Okay.

1554
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:25,640
flip it inside out and we'll make sure that i can fit in here wait that's that's my thought this feels so nimi nightmare okay what i had for nimi was a witch but oh we could do

1555
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,640
zombie skelly uh naked

1556
01:51:38,700 --> 01:51:39,620
Uh, so...

1557
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:48,660
If she's a zombie, though, I cut this out for no reason.

1558
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:52,340
Because I have...

1559
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:54,680
I have gray zombie skin.

1560
01:51:58,330 --> 01:51:59,690
I did think of Niminatar.

1561
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:00,490
I did.

1562
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:04,070
But I was like, how would I do that?

1563
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:06,010
As the puppet.

1564
01:52:06,210 --> 01:52:08,730
I guess I could give it hooves here.

1565
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,530
And then the nose.

1566
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:13,290
But anything else would be like...

1567
01:52:15,150 --> 01:52:38,610
vampire Oh Wait, wait, wait Wait, I'm cooking, I'm cooking, I'm cooking, I'm cooking Um With Wait, wait, wait, remember how we were doing Doki's jacket and I was like, it looks like a vampire And then I have the red Wait, on the back Like so?

1568
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:46,830
And then I can Line it with red And then we could do the black collar here.

1569
01:52:47,530 --> 01:52:48,890
And we could still do her dress.

1570
01:52:49,530 --> 01:52:50,450
Her green dress.

1571
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:55,630
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1572
01:52:56,750 --> 01:52:57,030
Okay.

1573
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:58,310
Vampire!

1574
01:52:58,970 --> 01:53:00,870
Vampire in Himmy Nightmare.

1575
01:53:06,610 --> 01:53:11,010
Evo, yura, yura, yura, yura, say...

1576
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:13,210
They're pretty good.

1577
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:16,650
Okay.

1578
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:19,430
I'm making sure everything's lined up.

1579
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:31,390
We'll make you happy!

1580
01:53:39,270 --> 01:53:40,870
I'll just send you guys the lyrics.

1581
01:53:41,110 --> 01:53:42,070
I'll just...

1582
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:51,650
When I post the lyric video, I will post the lyrics in text form below as well for you all to gander at.

1583
01:53:52,190 --> 01:53:52,670
Sound good?

1584
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:54,990
Good plan.

1585
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:06,370
Because I'm gonna be performing it soon, so I want you guys to know the calls.

1586
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:12,230
In fact, why didn't I perform at Club Iron Mouse yesterday?

1587
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:13,610
I don't know.

1588
01:54:14,610 --> 01:54:16,690
Did you guys see me at Club Iron Mouse?

1589
01:54:17,110 --> 01:54:19,530
I don't know.

1590
01:54:19,730 --> 01:54:21,050
My voice felt so shaky.

1591
01:54:21,350 --> 01:54:25,850
I was like, hopefully I was okay.

1592
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:26,370
I don't know.

1593
01:54:26,430 --> 01:54:28,290
For some reason, my voice was so, so shaky.

1594
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:33,510
Probably because I was nervous.

1595
01:54:35,950 --> 01:54:37,970
And the subtitles were saying things like Snakey.

1596
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:44,720
I was there for the concert.

1597
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:47,360
The whole concert was absolutely awesome.

1598
01:54:47,700 --> 01:54:49,500
It was wise, wasn't it?

1599
01:54:50,140 --> 01:54:51,600
It really was so, so good.

1600
01:54:51,740 --> 01:54:53,980
Mousy worked her butt off for it.

1601
01:54:55,080 --> 01:54:55,540
I, you know.

1602
01:54:56,580 --> 01:55:01,920
I'm glad that me and Phoebe and Vicky could all sing together in some sort of capacity.

1603
01:55:01,940 --> 01:55:35,160
capacity you know in a live show since that was what we wanted to do you know how we wanted to be together okay and usually for live concerts it's very rare for me to sing a slower song i almost always go like do fast songs idle songs things that you could do a lot of Calls to...

1604
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,260
Oh, there goes my glue stick.

1605
01:55:38,200 --> 01:55:40,980
But for this, I thought maybe...

1606
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:46,320
A lot of people will sing faster songs, so I'll pick a slow song to give a bit of a...

1607
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,320
A break for people.

1608
01:55:52,970 --> 01:55:53,910
Concert was peak.

1609
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:55,690
Love to see any other guests in Mousy.

1610
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:56,290
Yay!

1611
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:57,330
Thank you!

1612
01:55:57,530 --> 01:55:58,390
Thank you, thank you.

1613
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:00,530
Oh!

1614
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:05,190
Yeah, and people know Snake Eater, so I was like, maybe people will sing along.

1615
01:56:07,450 --> 01:56:08,910
It was fun, it was fun.

1616
01:56:09,230 --> 01:56:10,970
It was fun.

1617
01:56:11,190 --> 01:56:12,410
I love when people sing along.

1618
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:17,410
Because also I do a lot of songs where it's like you do calls but you don't really sing along so much.

1619
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:22,590
But for some songs I have coming up, I might spoil...

1620
01:56:23,170 --> 01:56:29,170
If you're going to US Idol Festival, I might spoil my set list so you guys can learn some of the calls.

1621
01:56:32,950 --> 01:56:35,730
Because two of them are songs I've never sung before.

1622
01:56:37,010 --> 01:56:43,850
And then one of, or I might switch out one, but then one song, I've only done karaoke once.

1623
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:47,730
So, hmm.

1624
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:51,710
Did I do this?

1625
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:51,990
Okay.

1626
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:55,070
Oh, no!

1627
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:57,590
She ripped her pants!

1628
01:56:58,150 --> 01:56:58,470
Oh, wait.

1629
01:56:58,810 --> 01:56:59,050
Uh-oh.

1630
01:56:59,290 --> 01:56:59,810
Uh-oh.

1631
01:57:01,530 --> 01:57:03,570
It's a little scuffed, but it works.

1632
01:57:03,870 --> 01:57:04,850
It looks like a ghost.

1633
01:57:06,530 --> 01:57:09,090
How did I put my hand down when I...

1634
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:09,830
I made this.

1635
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:11,050
Excuse me?

1636
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:11,850
Why is my thumbs?

1637
01:57:12,350 --> 01:57:13,150
Okay, whatever.

1638
01:57:14,730 --> 01:57:16,490
Wait, oh no, there's another hole, I think.

1639
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:17,690
Oh there, okay.

1640
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:18,750
Let's fix.

1641
01:57:18,990 --> 01:57:19,710
Wait, why?

1642
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:23,610
Why is my thumb not reaching this time?

1643
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:30,010
Why is my thumb not reaching this time?

1644
01:57:31,030 --> 01:57:32,970
I messed up.

1645
01:57:33,530 --> 01:57:33,910
No.

1646
01:57:35,970 --> 01:57:37,670
You traced it around the other way.

1647
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:41,410
This is supposed to be my tongue?

1648
01:57:43,170 --> 01:57:44,410
Uh-oh.

1649
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,980
Uh-oh.

1650
01:57:51,560 --> 01:57:52,340
Wait.

1651
01:57:53,620 --> 01:57:54,400
Repentor!

1652
01:57:56,040 --> 01:57:56,820
Thank

1653
01:58:03,660 --> 01:58:04,440
you!

1654
01:58:05,280 --> 01:58:05,540
Thank you!

1655
01:58:05,660 --> 01:58:07,100
Wait, play my song.

1656
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,140
No.

1657
01:58:09,260 --> 01:58:11,000
Not the clown music.

1658
01:58:13,940 --> 01:58:15,280
Not the clown music.

1659
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:17,660
Play my song.

1660
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:22,280
Wait, oh there's...

1661
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:25,720
Wait, wait, wait, I need the camera.

1662
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,180
Wait, wait, wait, hold on!

1663
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:28,340
I'm not ready!

1664
01:58:31,210 --> 01:58:32,390
Wait, where's the camera?

1665
01:58:32,470 --> 01:58:33,290
There it is, okay.

1666
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:33,710
Oh!

1667
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:38,710
My bad.

1668
01:58:40,390 --> 01:58:41,230
Okay, there we go.

1669
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:45,250
Can I take your order?

1670
01:58:45,570 --> 01:59:14,990
Sikoshi freaky, but I shall try my own qi jishimasu I will kill you myself My boy, my kid Docky, docky, docky, docky Docky, docky, docky

1671
01:59:29,450 --> 01:59:47,650
Wait, I have to pull up Nimi Nightmare.

1672
01:59:47,990 --> 01:59:49,050
Did I...

1673
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:50,210
I don't think I...

1674
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:51,250
Oh, yes I did.

1675
01:59:51,470 --> 01:59:54,910
I was like, I don't think I downloaded her reference sheet, but I did.

1676
01:59:55,010 --> 01:59:56,410
I was ahead of the game.

1677
01:59:57,370 --> 01:59:58,310
You're pretty good.

1678
01:59:58,770 --> 01:59:59,290
Thanks.

1679
01:59:59,870 --> 02:00:00,970
And we can use the brown.

1680
02:00:03,410 --> 02:00:04,390
For her ears.

1681
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:08,590
Good enough.

1682
02:00:11,090 --> 02:00:12,990
So we're making...

1683
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,530
We're making...

1684
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:16,950
Nimi Nightmare.

1685
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:18,810
Vampire.

1686
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:23,330
You could stab me, but don't stab yourself.

1687
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:25,390
Don't worry, I'm okay, I'm okay.

1688
02:00:26,130 --> 02:00:26,870
Thank you, Dove.

1689
02:00:27,650 --> 02:00:27,830
Okay.

1690
02:00:28,430 --> 02:00:30,070
Uh, let's see.

1691
02:00:34,370 --> 02:00:35,930
Yeah, my hands are huge.

1692
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:38,010
Thank you for noticing.

1693
02:00:38,770 --> 02:00:40,910
Oh, okay, let's get a couple things.

1694
02:00:41,190 --> 02:00:44,910
Because what I'm gonna do first is I'm gonna make her nurse...

1695
02:00:47,090 --> 02:00:47,970
Nurse... head.

1696
02:00:55,910 --> 02:00:57,110
That should be a good size.

1697
02:00:58,970 --> 02:01:00,270
That should be a good size.

1698
02:01:03,270 --> 02:01:04,670
Big hand equals a lot to hold.

1699
02:01:06,770 --> 02:01:08,430
I can hold so many things.

1700
02:01:09,550 --> 02:01:11,970
Yeah, I have big hands, which means I'm...

1701
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:14,750
Which means I'm huge, so you don't want to mess with me.

1702
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:18,990
I'd be like, what?

1703
02:01:20,290 --> 02:01:22,830
She's like, twice the size we thought she was.

1704
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:30,670
Has anyone told you lately that your work is really and truly important?

1705
02:01:32,550 --> 02:01:33,590
It's not...

1706
02:01:33,590 --> 02:01:34,350
It is!

1707
02:01:37,470 --> 02:01:38,290
Is it?

1708
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:45,690
I guess for those who watch streams to go to sleep, VTubers provide lots of content for that.

1709
02:01:47,290 --> 02:01:47,710
It's me.

1710
02:01:48,030 --> 02:01:50,690
I'm one of those people that watches streams to sleep.

1711
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:54,410
Oh, you can see it already.

1712
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:58,250
It already looks like her.

1713
02:01:58,390 --> 02:01:59,430
It already looks like her.

1714
02:02:02,900 --> 02:02:03,380
Okay.

1715
02:02:04,300 --> 02:02:05,380
I'm going to make her ears.

1716
02:02:05,900 --> 02:02:07,800
What I'm doing is I'm making these first.

1717
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:10,500
And then we'll put her hair on top.

1718
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:12,180
Yes, yes, yes.

1719
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,380
Ears time!

1720
02:02:17,100 --> 02:02:19,140
I've never made a tape of your ear.

1721
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:23,200
Yeah.

1722
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:26,280
Yeah.

1723
02:02:30,680 --> 02:02:31,800
Does she have a tail?

1724
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,060
She doesn't have a tail.

1725
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:37,520
A tape ear.

1726
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:39,680
Not a tape worm.

1727
02:02:40,680 --> 02:02:41,100
I hope not.

1728
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:43,880
You've gotten me through some hard days.

1729
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:45,160
It is important work.

1730
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:46,240
Really?

1731
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:48,500
I don't know.

1732
02:02:49,480 --> 02:02:49,980
I'm glad.

1733
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:51,440
I mean, what is it?

1734
02:02:51,440 --> 02:02:52,100
What did they say?

1735
02:02:52,180 --> 02:02:53,980
They say, protect the arts.

1736
02:02:56,680 --> 02:02:58,560
My, this is my craft.

1737
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:00,660
My mining and my craft.

1738
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:02,680
Protect the arts!

1739
02:03:10,180 --> 02:03:11,720
I can't see it!

1740
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,100
I can't see!

1741
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,320
Wait, it's not supposed to be pointy even a little bit.

1742
02:03:17,780 --> 02:03:19,560
It's supposed to be the most round.

1743
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:22,920
Round, round, round, round round.

1744
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:27,080
I wanted to make myself today, but I don't know if I will.

1745
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:33,920
Actually, I wanted, I was gonna make myself naked because I didn't buy any supplies from me.

1746
02:03:36,440 --> 02:03:38,220
So I was going to be naked.

1747
02:03:45,460 --> 02:03:47,280
And I don't want to hear any objections.

1748
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,840
Be like, no, God, the scariest costume you could be.

1749
02:03:51,660 --> 02:03:53,220
That is a pretty spooky costume.

1750
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:54,120
Probably.

1751
02:04:01,230 --> 02:04:02,530
Are you guys seeing it?

1752
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:05,490
I'm like mega seeing it right now.

1753
02:04:06,090 --> 02:04:07,730
I'm like super, this is...

1754
02:04:08,590 --> 02:04:10,550
Like, this is Nimi Nightmare.

1755
02:04:11,550 --> 02:04:12,030
100%.

1756
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:21,950
But her ears go in front, I think.

1757
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:28,100
Okay, now I glue.

1758
02:04:33,490 --> 02:04:34,190
I glue.

1759
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:36,110
I glue.

1760
02:04:43,880 --> 02:04:48,240
So you were going to make yourself in the swimsuit you were going to ask for from Ayami earlier.

1761
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:52,680
No, no, that's why I don't want her to make me naked because that's stealing my Halloween costume.

1762
02:04:53,160 --> 02:04:55,660
Uh, one of us would have to get dressed.

1763
02:04:57,140 --> 02:04:59,260
And this ain't, it ain't gonna be me.

1764
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:07,540
Did you guys watch Ayami Mama's 3D debut?

1765
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:09,760
It seemed a little scuffed.

1766
02:05:10,060 --> 02:05:10,300
Poor girl.

1767
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:11,520
Poor Mama.

1768
02:05:12,180 --> 02:05:12,540
Mama.

1769
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:13,600
Poor thing.

1770
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:15,960
It's a little scuffed.

1771
02:05:16,600 --> 02:05:17,420
But it was very cute.

1772
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:18,780
Her new...

1773
02:05:18,780 --> 02:05:19,740
I want to say Fuku.

1774
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:23,740
I want to say Fuku, but at the same time, I'm like...

1775
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:26,140
I already know what I'm doing for my next outfit.

1776
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:30,420
And I don't... And it will be around some...

1777
02:05:32,120 --> 02:05:34,600
So, unless I, like...

1778
02:05:39,250 --> 02:05:41,970
You bought all the fabrics if she didn't have a choice.

1779
02:05:43,070 --> 02:05:47,630
It'll be around summer, so it's really kind of like...

1780
02:05:47,630 --> 02:05:51,770
I have to prioritize what I want because of Celia's schedule, you know?

1781
02:05:52,770 --> 02:05:53,130
Hmm.

1782
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:55,090
You're very inspiring, Minto.

1783
02:05:55,270 --> 02:05:57,190
I started drawing this year because I wanted to get good enough.

1784
02:05:57,430 --> 02:05:57,950
What did I draw?

1785
02:05:58,070 --> 02:05:59,230
I've ever... Oh my god!

1786
02:05:59,430 --> 02:06:00,050
Thank you!

1787
02:06:03,630 --> 02:06:12,930
I have to think really hard about what outfits I want because it's like I get fewer, you know what I mean?

1788
02:06:13,910 --> 02:06:17,390
They have to be like, what do I really, really want?

1789
02:06:18,830 --> 02:06:20,590
Hold on, what did I do with your hair, Nimi?

1790
02:06:20,970 --> 02:06:21,590
Oh, here it is.

1791
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:27,810
Unless I don't work with Celia, but you know.

1792
02:06:30,770 --> 02:06:33,610
You make a bad day better, a good day better.

1793
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:37,330
Why was the charge of water treatment plant?

1794
02:06:37,650 --> 02:06:40,630
The water would taste extra nice.

1795
02:06:41,490 --> 02:06:41,610
Hmm?

1796
02:06:42,850 --> 02:06:43,850
I don't get it.

1797
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:46,610
Better, better.

1798
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:51,210
Betty bought some...

1799
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:54,630
Betty bought some butter, butter.

1800
02:06:55,310 --> 02:06:56,730
But it made her better butter.

1801
02:06:58,170 --> 02:06:59,650
Did the better...

1802
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:01,410
Did the...

1803
02:07:01,410 --> 02:07:03,510
Betty stream make her day better?

1804
02:07:03,630 --> 02:07:05,110
Better batter.

1805
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:13,330
I thought when I saw the silhouette of your comfy outfit, I thought you were getting a gal giaruminto.

1806
02:07:14,770 --> 02:07:17,270
That would be crazy for a second outfit.

1807
02:07:28,050 --> 02:07:29,930
Oh, okay, her hair.

1808
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:32,150
It has like a...

1809
02:07:32,150 --> 02:07:33,750
Hold on, Nimmy.

1810
02:07:34,270 --> 02:07:34,750
Go there.

1811
02:07:35,670 --> 02:07:37,410
It has like a craziness going on.

1812
02:07:37,470 --> 02:07:38,330
Where's my...

1813
02:07:38,330 --> 02:07:39,110
Ah, Sharpie!

1814
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:39,330
Okay.

1815
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:42,570
Nimmy's hair...

1816
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:45,570
might be the more difficult.

1817
02:07:47,690 --> 02:07:49,690
But we're gonna we're gonna attempt.

1818
02:07:51,590 --> 02:07:52,730
I can't grab this.

1819
02:07:53,010 --> 02:07:53,650
Is this a string?

1820
02:07:54,270 --> 02:07:54,530
Yeah.

1821
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:57,070
How do I get sharp?

1822
02:07:57,150 --> 02:08:00,270
I saw some of you guys saying how to get Sharpie off of your hands.

1823
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:01,550
How do you?

1824
02:08:02,450 --> 02:08:02,930

How to...

1843
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:23,560
Nimi is kind of intimidating.

1846
02:09:54,840 --> 02:09:57,300
Oh gosh, I already made it too thin, I think.

1847
02:09:57,700 --> 02:10:01,680
Oh wait, and also, oh my gosh, I forgot to do the eyeball check.

1848
02:10:17,310 --> 02:10:17,590

1849
02:10:24,710 --> 02:10:26,250
Okay, good, good, good, good, good.

You can see, like, yeah, it's pretty...

1852
02:10:33,630 --> 02:10:35,810
Unless I make it thinner, I mean, we could do that.

1853
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:36,570
Let me try.

1854
02:10:37,290 --> 02:10:37,750
Let me try.

1855
02:10:37,910 --> 02:10:38,250
Let me try.

1856
02:10:39,370 --> 02:10:42,190
Even she's looking, she's looking.

1857
02:10:44,170 --> 02:10:58,010
it's really just that her hair is like like this it's kind of difficult but I'll do my best don't kill me naplings I'm already done

1858
02:11:01,640 --> 02:11:04,140

1859
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:12,380
okay I thought I spilled something okay

1860
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:22,430
I look alive today but I oh my gosh wait wait wait wait because I'm possessing someone, can you guys say look alive?

1861
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:25,450

1862
02:11:25,810 --> 02:11:31,530
Like, you know how in the movies, or like before work or something, they're like, alright everybody, look alive!

1863
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:32,230
Look alive!

1864
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,770
Okay, please.

1865
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:34,190
Okay.

1866
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:36,210
How do I do that?

1867
02:11:36,350 --> 02:11:36,830
Wait, no!

1868
02:11:37,690 --> 02:11:40,130
Wait, how do I look alive?

1869
02:11:42,010 --> 02:11:42,570
Hold on.

1870
02:11:42,630 --> 02:11:43,550
Look alive, me too!

1871
02:11:51,300 --> 02:11:52,260
Do something!

1872
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:52,660
Do something!

1873
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:55,860
Jazz hands!

1874
02:12:10,640 --> 02:12:14,800
That's me screaming at the existential dread.

1875
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:18,880
I'm going to die someday.

1876
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:21,380
It could be any day.

1877
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:22,300
It could be tomorrow.

1878
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,360
But it's not right now.

1879
02:12:34,380 --> 02:12:34,880
Yay.

1880
02:12:37,740 --> 02:12:39,200
Look alive, Minto, you got work to do.

1881
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:40,140
Yeah, oh, I do.

1882
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:40,540
I do.

1883
02:12:44,460 --> 02:12:47,540
Okay, we're cutting out the pieces.

1884
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,740
I might have made this one a little too detailed, but that's okay.

1885
02:12:53,040 --> 02:12:53,440
That's okay.

1886
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,880
Look alive, Miss Maid.

1887
02:12:58,720 --> 02:12:59,120
Yeah.

1888
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:04,320
As a ghost, aren't you already dead?

1889
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:08,720
Yeah, but if I'm possessing somebody who is alive currently, then I get to pretend.

1890
02:13:09,300 --> 02:13:11,720
role playing as a living person today.

1891
02:13:13,140 --> 02:13:15,900
Thank you so much for the podcast, thank you guys for the Super Chat too.

1892
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:16,740
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1893
02:13:18,420 --> 02:13:19,920
Stop reminding me of my mortality.

1894
02:13:20,140 --> 02:13:20,680
Oh, my bad.

1895
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,260
Don't worry about it.

1896
02:13:23,020 --> 02:13:23,860
Don't worry about it.

1897
02:13:24,040 --> 02:13:24,780
Don't think about it.

1898
02:13:26,440 --> 02:13:27,760
Don't don't don't that it.

1899
02:13:27,880 --> 02:13:28,480
Don't think about it.

1900
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:41,800
Just think about Vampire Nimi Nightmare, which we are constructing at this very moment.

1901
02:13:45,900 --> 02:13:46,020
Ah!

1902
02:13:48,080 --> 02:13:50,440
I've never seen anyone move their hands as much?

1903
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:50,920
No.

1904
02:13:51,240 --> 02:13:57,860
This is, I think, quite normal for a lot of streamers.

1905
02:13:59,720 --> 02:14:03,220
Especially, like, when I... Because...

1906
02:14:03,220 --> 02:14:04,340
How do I say?

1907
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:08,900
I don't often get to show hands.

1908
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:12,260
So.

1909
02:14:17,890 --> 02:14:18,750
Bing bong.

1910
02:14:19,810 --> 02:14:20,630
Oh, there we go.

1911
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:22,010
Oh gosh.

1912
02:14:22,190 --> 02:14:22,370
Oh gosh.

1913
02:14:25,230 --> 02:14:25,790
Please.

1914
02:14:26,830 --> 02:14:31,750
This one is really soft compared to where Do-Kitty's hair.

1915
02:14:33,290 --> 02:14:35,550
Like you can- like so floppy, you know.

1916
02:14:37,130 --> 02:14:39,050
Where Do-Kitty's hair was so hard.

1917
02:14:41,750 --> 02:14:42,850
Even though- same brand.

1918
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:45,450
I got these all the same place.

1919
02:14:47,170 --> 02:14:47,970
She's got hands.

1920
02:14:48,210 --> 02:14:49,130
Catch these hands.

1921
02:14:50,090 --> 02:14:51,130
Catching my hands.

1922
02:14:51,910 --> 02:14:52,910
Hold my hands.

1923
02:14:53,490 --> 02:14:54,190
Don't do that.

1924
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:55,670
It's embarrassing.

1925
02:15:06,270 --> 02:15:08,690
This, like, felt it also feels so nice.

1926
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:11,010
It's so soft.

1927
02:15:14,230 --> 02:15:17,610
Probably would have been really great as chest hair.

1928
02:15:18,050 --> 02:15:19,290
For a furry.

1929
02:15:19,610 --> 02:15:20,690
Wait, the niminitar.

1930
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:22,710
We could still do it.

1931
02:15:24,610 --> 02:15:25,790
Alright, moment of truth, everybody.

1932
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:27,690
Moment of truth.

1933
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:35,330
It's a little off, but it works.

1934
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:36,630
It

1935
02:15:39,820 --> 02:15:40,360
works.

1936
02:15:48,030 --> 02:15:49,230
It works.

1937
02:15:50,110 --> 02:15:51,190
It works.

1938
02:15:51,190 --> 02:15:51,570
It works.

1939
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:01,560
Like, here she's, she's, you can't really see.

1940
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:03,460
Hold on, if I move it over a smidge.

My drink today is a ginger honey tea, but the ginger is so spicy.

1943
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:20,260
It's very strong.

1944
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:21,160
Oh, wait.

1945
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:24,220
Before we do that, I'm going to do the cross on her,

1946
02:17:32,730 --> 02:17:33,770
even though it's not green.

1947
02:17:34,350 --> 02:17:35,910
But it's not red, so it's fine.

1948
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:38,630
We won't get flagged by the...

1949
02:17:39,930 --> 02:17:40,850

1950
02:17:40,850 --> 02:17:41,850

1955
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:31,930
Where, what's that country that everybody goes to to get their hair transplant?

1956
02:18:35,210 --> 02:18:36,010
Turkey!

1957
02:18:37,150 --> 02:18:37,330
Wait.

02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:48,220
Look, look, look.

1961
02:18:57,850 --> 02:18:59,630
Was that a setup just to do that?

1962
02:18:59,750 --> 02:19:02,710
No, I couldn't remember the name of the country.

1963
02:19:04,810 --> 02:19:13,090
Oh wait, I should have moved the bald spot to this side because then I could hide it with her ponytail.

1964
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:19,000
Well, she's a vampire.

1965
02:19:19,140 --> 02:19:19,820
She could be flipped.

1966
02:19:21,560 --> 02:19:22,480
It's opposite day.

1967
02:19:24,960 --> 02:19:25,800
It's opposite day!

1968
02:19:25,920 --> 02:19:26,740
It's opposite day!

1969
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:30,820
Add more hair?

1970
02:19:32,880 --> 02:19:34,300
Oh, we really are turkey.

1971
02:19:36,440 --> 02:19:37,380
Gobble, gobble.

1972
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:40,440
Happy Thanksgiving.

1973
02:19:42,460 --> 02:19:44,740
I mean, it's gonna be in November before we know it.

1974
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:48,540
But didn't Canadian Thanksgiving just happen?

1975
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:55,070
I do have to do the back of her hair, but...

1976
02:19:58,910 --> 02:19:59,910
Nimmy's a vampire.

1977
02:20:00,070 --> 02:20:02,230
She is for my Halloween puppet series.

1978
02:20:04,030 --> 02:20:05,510
Wait, it's so cute!

1979
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:14,620
I want to try and do the little flippy of her hair.

1980
02:20:17,140 --> 02:20:18,460
Okay, there's gonna be an attempt here.

1981
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:20,640
All right, we're doing brave science.

1982
02:20:21,220 --> 02:20:22,180
Pray for me!

1983
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:24,640
Pray for me!

1984
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,040
Oh, Bogos!

1985
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:42,440
I might be too good at this.

1986
02:20:42,560 --> 02:20:44,180
I really should take commissions.

1987
02:20:46,820 --> 02:20:58,720
Maybe I'll do like a very limited, like a merch drop one day where I take like five people and you can get a custom puppet made by me.

1988
02:21:00,940 --> 02:21:05,540
It would be much more detailed than this too because I would put much more care into it.

1989
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:09,320
She's really been showing off her booty.

1990
02:21:09,920 --> 02:21:10,780
My booty!

1991
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:22,160
I would love to do like kind of hand mids.

1992
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:23,540
stuff like that, you know?

1993
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:28,020
Obviously, I could only do so much of them, so many of them.

1994
02:21:28,500 --> 02:21:30,020
You could make a few in auction, though.

1995
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:33,200
I don't know, though.

1996
02:21:33,300 --> 02:21:35,480
I feel worried about an auction.

1997
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,800
I don't want people being like, I must...

1998
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:41,620
It's a one-of-a-kind Mickey Original.

1999
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:43,160
I must pay the money.

2000
02:21:43,340 --> 02:21:45,800
I don't want to cause anything like that.

2001
02:21:48,740 --> 02:21:50,840
Oh, maybe if it's for a fundraiser, though.

2002
02:21:50,920 --> 02:21:51,380
That's true.

2003
02:21:51,460 --> 02:21:52,060
That's true.

2004
02:21:52,540 --> 02:21:53,700
That would be good.

2005
02:21:54,240 --> 02:21:55,360
It's for like a charity.

2006
02:21:57,820 --> 02:21:57,940
Charity.

2007
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:00,340
Well, I guess the charity is not the one getting the puppet.

2008
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:02,820
Because can you imagine?

2009
02:22:02,940 --> 02:22:04,980
I'm like, this is for the children.

2010
02:22:06,780 --> 02:22:09,980
They'll be like, um, thank you.

2011
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:16,040
This is for the children to play with.

2012
02:22:24,440 --> 02:22:25,200
Nimi,

2013
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:32,660
let's dance together.

2014
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:33,680
Wait.

2015
02:22:44,450 --> 02:22:46,070
Oh my god, she's so talented.

2016
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:15,030
Okay, sorry.

2017
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:16,650
Sorry about that.

2018
02:23:17,170 --> 02:23:17,930
Intermission.

2019
02:23:19,710 --> 02:23:20,010
Okay.

2020
02:23:21,210 --> 02:23:22,230
We have...

2021
02:23:22,930 --> 02:23:23,330
All right.

2022
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:25,210
I don't need anything.

2023
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:27,970
anything handmade, all I need is your hand!

2024
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:30,570
You're trying to jump off the hand!

2025
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:33,290
This isn't even my body!

2026
02:23:34,370 --> 02:23:36,070
Wait, what if it's like, it, what's it called?

2027
02:23:36,190 --> 02:23:38,350
Like, wait, hold on.

2028
02:23:40,230 --> 02:23:44,830
Oh, it looks like, it looks like, it looks like the hand from Adam's family.

2029
02:23:46,870 --> 02:23:47,850
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing.

2030
02:23:48,350 --> 02:23:49,350
Who is cousin it?

2031
02:23:51,370 --> 02:23:52,790
Who's cousin, what does he do?

2032
02:23:53,230 --> 02:23:54,450
This is the bald guy, right?

2033
02:23:58,990 --> 02:24:00,290
No, that's not the bald...

2034
02:24:00,290 --> 02:24:00,970
Oh, it's...

2035
02:24:00,970 --> 02:24:02,430
Oh, the hairy guy!

2036
02:24:03,090 --> 02:24:04,690
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

2037
02:24:04,930 --> 02:24:05,670
Thank you, thank you.

2038
02:24:06,030 --> 02:24:07,270
Yeah, that's Uncle Fester.

2039
02:24:09,630 --> 02:24:09,870
Yeah.

2040
02:24:12,750 --> 02:24:14,230
Fester is the bald guy.

2041
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:16,370
I always forget that.

2042
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:18,330
There's a hairy guy in there.

2043
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:21,810
Okay, next, um...

2044
02:24:21,810 --> 02:24:23,430
I kind of want to do her smile.

2045
02:24:23,850 --> 02:24:24,430
Is that okay?

2046
02:24:26,390 --> 02:24:26,870
Okay.

2047
02:24:27,170 --> 02:24:32,270
I kind of want to make her have like little mischievous eyebrows to be like.

2048
02:24:33,150 --> 02:24:35,390
Wait, but I might have to cut her hair a bit more.

2049
02:24:35,850 --> 02:24:36,570
Hold on.

2050
02:24:39,080 --> 02:24:40,660
I got to get nice and close.

2051
02:24:41,920 --> 02:24:42,600
Let me.

2052
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:52,410
It didn't really work.

2053
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:53,130
But that's okay.

2054
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:56,110
Did you make the puppets twerk?

2055
02:25:36,660 --> 02:25:38,200
Sorry about that.

2056
02:25:38,960 --> 02:25:39,540
Okay, anyway.

2057
02:25:51,270 --> 02:25:51,690
Um...

2058
02:25:51,690 --> 02:25:54,090
Oh, her smile- Oh, I want to give her mischievous eyebrows.

2059
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:55,750
Okay, hold on.

2060
02:26:03,820 --> 02:26:04,660
That's good enough.

2061
02:26:05,180 --> 02:26:08,700
The other one, it- And then, and then, we'll give her a mouth.

2062
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:21,290
Is this adjacent to making your friends in the Sims?

2063
02:26:21,750 --> 02:26:22,170
Yeah.

2064
02:26:22,610 --> 02:26:23,330
Pretty much.

2065
02:26:24,350 --> 02:26:26,010
Points for that puppet action.

2066
02:26:28,790 --> 02:26:29,650
So cute.

2067
02:26:30,870 --> 02:26:38,630
Okay, so before we make her vampire cape, we're going to make her dress.

2068
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:41,010
So let me grab the green and the white.

2069
02:26:41,890 --> 02:26:44,030
Green, white.

2070
02:26:46,410 --> 02:26:46,750
Okay.

2071
02:26:47,730 --> 02:26:48,010
Okay.

2072
02:26:49,050 --> 02:26:49,570
No pressure.

2073
02:26:50,390 --> 02:26:50,930
No pressure.

2074
02:26:51,350 --> 02:26:51,750
No pressure.

2075
02:26:52,610 --> 02:26:53,170
No pressure.

2076
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:54,870
Oh, she looks all tucked in.

2077
02:26:55,110 --> 02:26:55,570
So cute.

2078
02:26:55,710 --> 02:26:55,730
Oh.

2079
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,590
Impressive.

2080
02:26:57,770 --> 02:26:58,290
Very nice.

2081
02:26:58,410 --> 02:26:58,930
Thank you.

2082
02:26:59,130 --> 02:26:59,710
Thank you.

2083
02:26:59,970 --> 02:27:00,490
Thank you.

2084
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:02,530
A little bow.

2085
02:27:03,290 --> 02:27:04,650
Oh, thank you.

2086
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:05,750
Thank you.

2087
02:27:06,170 --> 02:27:06,630
Thank you.

2088
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:10,830
Speaking of the Adams family, I got to be lurch in a production of the musical.

2089
02:27:11,270 --> 02:27:18,750
Since I'm a little short for lurch, I got to wear stilts from 5 foot 7 to over 7 foot tall.

2090
02:27:19,790 --> 02:27:20,830
That's crazy.

2091
02:27:21,890 --> 02:27:22,410
Whoa.

2092
02:27:30,550 --> 02:27:32,610
She looks so silly.

2093
02:27:38,450 --> 02:27:39,570
Okay, so about here.

2094
02:27:42,090 --> 02:27:45,930
I'm getting ink all over my fingers again.

2095
02:27:52,950 --> 02:27:54,270
I just gotta trace her body.

2096
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:57,170
I gotta trace her hot bod.

2097
02:27:57,750 --> 02:27:58,810
That's all I gotta do.

2098
02:28:00,450 --> 02:28:03,230
You could always put the green behind the white to cut it.

2099
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:13,620
What do you mean?

2100
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:17,960
You're...

2101
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:22,140
It's my birthday tomorrow!

2102
02:28:23,820 --> 02:28:26,020
And I mark Tyson's ass!

2103
02:28:26,460 --> 02:28:27,160
Happy birthday!

2104
02:28:43,210 --> 02:28:45,510
Oh, to trace her body!

2105
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:49,650
Oh, I get it, I get it.

2106
02:28:50,170 --> 02:28:51,810
That's okay though, I'm already here.

2107
02:28:54,370 --> 02:28:55,890
I'm already here.

2108
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:02,700
The side was not as thick.

2109
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:06,140
Oh yeah.

2110
02:29:06,460 --> 02:29:07,320
Oh, be careful.

2111
02:29:08,300 --> 02:29:09,300
We'll go like this.

2112
02:29:13,020 --> 02:29:15,160
I need to decide where I want her...

2113
02:29:16,580 --> 02:29:18,760
Her shirt to go up to, you know?

2114
02:29:19,580 --> 02:29:21,120
Her dress I'm in.

2115
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:23,160
Like that.

2116
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:29,920
Oh, wow.

2117
02:29:30,820 --> 02:29:32,900
Have you been working out in me?

2118
02:29:44,020 --> 02:29:45,160
She's naked!

2119
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:46,620
All right.

2120
02:29:48,560 --> 02:29:49,160
All right.

2121
02:29:50,900 --> 02:29:51,300
Oh, wait.

2122
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:52,980
I need to make it a little thicker.

2123
02:29:53,920 --> 02:29:56,300
So it covers her completely.

2124
02:29:57,620 --> 02:29:59,000
YouTube's gonna ban me.

2125
02:30:03,080 --> 02:30:04,340
You think I should give this to her?

2126
02:30:04,820 --> 02:30:06,160
You think she'll want it?

2127
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:10,340
You think she'd want this?

2128
02:30:11,560 --> 02:30:13,420
Nemi, I made you.

2129
02:30:14,260 --> 02:30:16,940
This seems like something a stalker would give somebody.

2130
02:30:19,360 --> 02:30:21,480
Too hot for you too.

2131
02:30:25,550 --> 02:30:28,490
And can you use your powers to make my food taste better?

2132
02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:30,570
Of course!

2133
02:30:33,030 --> 02:30:34,250
Moe Moe Kim!

2134
02:30:35,070 --> 02:30:36,030
Wait, it was kind of perfect.

2135
02:30:36,390 --> 02:30:37,610
Don, thank you so much for the food!

2136
02:30:37,930 --> 02:30:41,690
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2137
02:30:43,610 --> 02:30:44,650
Um, okay.

2138
02:30:55,660 --> 02:30:57,400
There you go.

2139
02:30:57,720 --> 02:31:00,780
It should be so yummy now.

2140
02:31:02,540 --> 02:31:04,420
It should be the most delicious.

2141
02:31:12,990 --> 02:31:14,090
Pika pika boo!

2142
02:31:14,910 --> 02:31:16,950
Pika pika pika pika boo.

2143
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:17,990
Pika pika boo!

2144
02:31:18,490 --> 02:31:19,690
Pika pika boo!

2145
02:31:21,690 --> 02:31:22,750
You're pretty good.

2146
02:31:31,310 --> 02:31:31,850
Alright!

2147
02:31:34,170 --> 02:31:34,690
Okay!

2148
02:31:35,130 --> 02:31:37,270
Wait, that actually works so well!

2149
02:31:38,190 --> 02:31:38,970
Oh my gosh!

2150
02:31:39,110 --> 02:31:42,330
Okay, now mid-out-made apron.

2151
02:31:44,350 --> 02:31:44,690
Hmm.

2152
02:31:45,130 --> 02:31:46,410
How do I want to do this?

2153
02:31:47,450 --> 02:31:49,370
Let me glue this first.

2154
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:52,350
Let me glue this first.

2155
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:05,750
Oops, I'm getting it on...

2156
02:32:06,370 --> 02:32:08,710
I'm getting it on my glue gun.

2157
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:10,170
Can I get a hat?

2158
02:32:10,190 --> 02:32:11,190
A head pat for Nimi.

2159
02:32:17,730 --> 02:32:18,590
Like that?

2160
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:33,580
One second though, free!

2161
02:32:34,180 --> 02:32:34,360
Free!

2162
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:34,760
Okay.

2163
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:36,620
Okay.

2164
02:32:37,820 --> 02:32:38,200
Ah!

2165
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:40,440
She's looking at me.

2166
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:43,660
Why are you looking at me like that?

2167
02:32:44,020 --> 02:32:44,220
Hmm?

2168
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:46,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

2169
02:32:46,560 --> 02:32:47,020
Nimi Nima?

2170
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:56,560
She looks mischievous.

2171
02:32:57,900 --> 02:32:59,960
She's up to no good.

2172
02:33:04,930 --> 02:33:05,030
Oh.

2173
02:33:05,910 --> 02:33:09,390
I don't think it'll fall over, but I just don't want it shaking so much.

2174
02:33:09,690 --> 02:33:12,650
So you guys don't get, like, sick.

2175
02:33:13,570 --> 02:33:14,110
Motion sick.

2176
02:33:15,250 --> 02:33:17,130
Cute Minto hand gestures and clapping is cute.

2177
02:33:17,570 --> 02:33:18,930
Hand heart is my weakness.

2178
02:33:19,350 --> 02:33:20,250
Good work on the craft.

2179
02:33:20,810 --> 02:33:22,070
Thank you.

2180
02:33:23,450 --> 02:33:24,330
Tech-tech-tech-y.

2181
02:33:27,110 --> 02:33:27,670
Okay.

2182
02:33:36,050 --> 02:33:36,770
Now...

2183
02:33:36,770 --> 02:33:37,410
Apron.

2184
02:33:40,640 --> 02:33:41,880
How do I want to do this?

2185
02:33:45,960 --> 02:33:46,940
How, how, how?

2186
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:49,740
Probably.

2187
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:53,280
What do we do?

2188
02:33:57,890 --> 02:33:58,550
Is I...

2189
02:34:00,650 --> 02:34:01,730
Like so.

2190
02:34:02,010 --> 02:34:03,510
I just got myself again.

2191
02:34:04,410 --> 02:34:04,890
Like this.

2192
02:34:08,250 --> 02:34:08,890
Like this.

2193
02:34:11,490 --> 02:34:12,010
Okay.

2194
02:34:13,070 --> 02:34:13,790
Booby time.

2195
02:34:15,810 --> 02:34:16,170
Where's her?

2196
02:34:16,310 --> 02:34:18,310
Okay, this is her waist right here.

2197
02:34:20,990 --> 02:34:21,550
Oh wait, booby.

2198
02:34:22,910 --> 02:34:23,450
Oopsie.

2199
02:34:23,930 --> 02:34:30,550
I think you wiggle waggle never gets old, which is why you're still 19.

2200
02:34:31,750 --> 02:34:32,570
Yes, sir.

2201
02:34:34,450 --> 02:34:35,390
Okay, booby.

2202
02:34:37,470 --> 02:34:39,550
But I already messed up.

2203
02:34:46,160 --> 02:34:47,980
But I already messed up.

2204
02:34:48,300 --> 02:34:49,260
Oh, man.

2205
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:56,480
I can't use the back because it'll be aligned to this side, you know?

2206
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:04,870
Maybe I can just use a different part.

2207
02:35:05,490 --> 02:35:06,370
We'll just redo it.

2208
02:35:06,570 --> 02:35:07,290
We'll just redo it.

2209
02:35:10,550 --> 02:35:12,830
We'll redo, redo, redo, redo, redo.

2210
02:35:13,090 --> 02:35:13,430
redo

2211
02:35:19,890 --> 02:35:27,090
okay that should be okay that should be okay

2212
02:35:30,810 --> 02:35:32,250
here waste

2213
02:35:36,410 --> 02:35:55,050
boob wait yes yes i think yes i think oops oh no it's a little crooked it's fine it's fine It's fine!

2214
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:57,230
We're doing it live!

2215
02:36:00,130 --> 02:36:01,270
It's fine!

2216
02:36:03,110 --> 02:36:06,590
Add another layer of white for volume of boobs!

2217
02:36:07,350 --> 02:36:09,790
That is such a funny way of having to censor it.

2218
02:36:17,850 --> 02:36:19,070
Hopefully this works.

2219
02:36:20,490 --> 02:36:21,490
Hopefully this works, okay.

2220
02:36:23,130 --> 02:36:23,690
Let's go away.

2221
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:24,030
Alright.

2222
02:36:33,640 --> 02:36:35,760
B-B-B-B-B-B-Bee-Boo B-Boo!

2223
02:36:42,590 --> 02:36:43,950
Back to the Nyanya version.

2224
02:36:50,990 --> 02:36:53,830
I kind of want to put, like, blood on it, you know?

2225
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:02,300
Is this going to work?

2226
02:37:02,520 --> 02:37:03,520
Actually, I have no idea.

2227
02:37:03,660 --> 02:37:05,480
I might have totally messed this up, but that's fine.

2228
02:37:05,560 --> 02:37:06,360
I have a lot of white.

2229
02:37:07,860 --> 02:37:10,240
I have a lot of white felt, so it's okay.

2230
02:37:10,760 --> 02:37:13,300
This one is also so flimsy.

2231
02:37:15,860 --> 02:37:17,740
I feel like I measured it correctly, though.

2232
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,620
Besides the bottom.

2233
02:37:21,900 --> 02:37:22,660
Let's see.

2234
02:37:23,500 --> 02:37:23,660
Wait.

2235
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:26,520
Nimmy would approve.

2236
02:37:26,700 --> 02:37:27,260
You think so?

2237
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:31,780
Her boobs are also a little misshapen.

2238
02:37:35,540 --> 02:37:36,800
Wait, this kind of works.

2239
02:37:37,880 --> 02:37:39,280
This kind of works, right?

2240
02:37:57,150 --> 02:37:58,290
You think it works?

2241
02:37:59,650 --> 02:38:01,350
And then maybe I could put a strap.

2242
02:38:02,790 --> 02:38:03,090
Like that.

2243
02:38:03,770 --> 02:38:04,290
Hold on.

2244
02:38:05,170 --> 02:38:06,390
Like all the way around.

2245
02:38:06,550 --> 02:38:07,150
I think it'll work.

2246
02:38:07,170 --> 02:38:08,010
I think it'll work.

2247
02:38:10,170 --> 02:38:11,750
I have nothing long enough verse.

2248
02:38:12,050 --> 02:38:12,250
Oh!

2249
02:38:16,150 --> 02:38:17,550
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2250
02:38:18,850 --> 02:38:20,130
Good stuff, good stuff.

2251
02:38:20,650 --> 02:38:22,230
It's a little crooked, but who cares?

2252
02:38:23,610 --> 02:38:24,070
Who cares?

2253
02:38:24,190 --> 02:38:25,050
It's part of the art.

2254
02:38:25,210 --> 02:38:26,450
It's part of the art history.

2255
02:38:30,710 --> 02:38:31,590
Wait, uh...

2256
02:38:32,550 --> 02:38:39,670
This one I was able to flip around because I did it incorrectly to begin with, so...

2257
02:38:39,690 --> 02:38:41,190
They ended up working out.

2258
02:38:42,770 --> 02:38:42,930
Okay.

2259
02:38:43,930 --> 02:38:45,830
I have to be very, very careful.

2260
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:49,170
Very, very careful here.

2261
02:38:49,610 --> 02:38:49,910
Oh!

2262
02:38:51,930 --> 02:38:53,630
Oh, please, go down a little.

2263
02:38:54,330 --> 02:38:55,710
Um, okay, good enough.

2264
02:39:01,730 --> 02:39:02,330
Safe!

2265
02:39:03,150 --> 02:39:04,570
We're safe!

2266
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:06,130
Ooh!

2267
02:39:08,710 --> 02:39:09,310
Okay.

2268
02:39:09,710 --> 02:39:10,630
And what are... Oh, here.

2269
02:39:12,350 --> 02:39:12,950
Alright.

2270
02:39:12,970 --> 02:39:16,050
let's uh let's

2271
02:39:20,110 --> 02:39:31,290
cut the bottom well i actually i need to cut both sides but oh wait yeah this is the bottom

2272
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:39,920
very very careful and

2273
02:39:43,110 --> 02:39:48,470
then a little off the top a little off the top a little

2274
02:39:57,290 --> 02:39:59,750
yippee oh that looks so good

2275
02:40:06,860 --> 02:40:08,140
I don't think we need the glue.

2276
02:40:09,620 --> 02:40:10,920
I'll just make it nice and taut.

2277
02:40:11,540 --> 02:40:11,860
There we go.

2278
02:40:22,340 --> 02:40:24,480
Oh, I wonder if I can make some ruffles.

2279
02:40:25,100 --> 02:40:25,420
Hmm.

2280
02:40:27,260 --> 02:40:28,460
It might be difficult, though.

2281
02:40:28,580 --> 02:40:29,020
It's fine.

2282
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:29,480
It's fine.

2283
02:40:31,020 --> 02:40:31,940
Well, no, it's fine.

2284
02:40:32,400 --> 02:40:33,120
You can still tell.

2285
02:40:33,240 --> 02:40:33,660
You can still tell.

2286
02:40:33,820 --> 02:40:35,300
It kind of looks more like what's it called?

2287
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:40,560
like a chibi nimi and

2288
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:54,520
now we vampire it we make it a little bit more spooky vampiry let's see how do I want to do this um

2289
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:15,610
traveling in a few hours I'm super nervous but my ocean is cute fills me with determination also cute nails thank you thank you thank you have a good trip Salkin tell your girlfriend I said hi I mean I Girlfriend.

2290
02:41:18,190 --> 02:41:19,330
Taylor, I said hi.

2291
02:41:21,470 --> 02:41:22,730
Or wait, are you going home?

2292
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:23,650
I can't remember.

2293
02:41:30,310 --> 02:41:31,010
Blood on the apron.

2294
02:41:32,010 --> 02:41:32,850
I think I have an idea.

2295
02:41:34,770 --> 02:41:35,070
Hold on.

2296
02:41:35,310 --> 02:41:35,870
One moment.

2297
02:41:44,470 --> 02:41:45,350
Our girlfriend.

2298
02:41:45,590 --> 02:41:46,510
I think he's going out to visit.

2299
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:47,410
Okay, that's what I thought.

2300
02:41:50,830 --> 02:41:51,970
Pompoms of blood.

2301
02:41:54,350 --> 02:41:56,550
Pom poms of blood!

2302
02:41:58,710 --> 02:41:59,230
Wait, actually?

2303
02:41:59,670 --> 02:42:04,930
This is so...

2304
02:42:05,570 --> 02:42:08,490
Wait, I could do the pink on her cheeks.

2305
02:42:09,650 --> 02:42:10,690
I have to find more though.

2306
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:12,410
I'm dropping all of them.

2307
02:42:17,060 --> 02:42:18,100
Okay, I found some pink.

2308
02:42:19,140 --> 02:42:20,120
Visiting her for a week.

2309
02:42:20,260 --> 02:42:20,880
Ah, okay, okay.

2310
02:42:21,940 --> 02:42:23,340
Ah, have fun!

2311
02:42:27,840 --> 02:42:40,840
okay now we add the blood cover her in oranges it's it looks more orange on this on the camera but I promise you it's red

2312
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:51,450
I'm just dumping all of these out at this rate like that like that

2313
02:42:55,300 --> 02:43:00,920
kind of like sporadic it's fuzzy blood.

2314
02:43:01,620 --> 02:43:02,660
I don't know what else to use.

2315
02:43:02,920 --> 02:43:06,540
I guess I could use what I did for Doki's collar, but...

2316
02:43:11,900 --> 02:43:13,200
Looks like pepperoni.

2317
02:43:14,820 --> 02:43:16,400
Why do you want me to...

2318
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:18,440
You want... I have a...

2319
02:43:18,440 --> 02:43:19,240
Alright, guys.

2320
02:43:20,020 --> 02:43:21,160
It's guro time.

2321
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:29,770
This is where the real spooky stream starts.

2322
02:43:34,920 --> 02:43:38,180
It's not my body, so... Why should I care?

2323
02:43:40,120 --> 02:43:42,340
and just possess anybody I want.

2324
02:43:44,360 --> 02:43:44,820
Maybe I... Hold on.

2325
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:46,720
Let's see how we can use these, though.

2326
02:43:47,740 --> 02:43:50,740
Maybe I can, like, cut off the fuzz or something.

2327
02:43:51,220 --> 02:43:55,640
If I push them down, if I make them real flat...

2328
02:43:57,620 --> 02:43:58,140
Uh...

2329
02:43:58,140 --> 02:43:59,640
If I make them real flat...

2330
02:44:00,440 --> 02:44:00,840
Maybe.

2331
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:03,160
Or...

2332
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:04,040
Tear it apart.

2333
02:44:04,500 --> 02:44:04,880
Oh!

2334
02:44:15,540 --> 02:44:17,060
Oh my god!

2335
02:44:19,460 --> 02:44:21,360
Oh my god!

2336
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:24,740
Oh!

2337
02:44:25,980 --> 02:44:27,860
Wait, that actually looks so good!

2338
02:44:29,660 --> 02:44:30,420
Movie magic.

2339
02:44:32,760 --> 02:44:33,940
I don't think it'll stay though.

2340
02:44:35,180 --> 02:44:37,620
I don't know how to glue this on here.

2341
02:44:47,140 --> 02:44:48,440
Nemi pepperoni pizza.

2342
02:44:50,540 --> 02:44:51,880
Nemi pepperoni pizza.

2343
02:44:55,340 --> 02:44:57,900
I came here for Crafts did for Witchcraft.

2344
02:44:59,660 --> 02:45:01,980
How do I glue this on, though?

2345
02:45:06,240 --> 02:45:08,720
Well, at first, I mean, glue these.

2346
02:45:13,210 --> 02:45:16,470
It's hard because, you know, with what's it called?

2347
02:45:17,290 --> 02:45:19,090
With the hot glue, it's like so...

2348
02:45:19,090 --> 02:45:20,690
I was going to say, it's so sticky.

2349
02:45:20,970 --> 02:45:25,650
I mean, it's glue, but it has, like, you know, the stringiness to it, too, which makes it more difficult.

2350
02:45:26,110 --> 02:45:26,530
Hmm.

2351
02:45:33,700 --> 02:45:34,980
Let's see.

2352
02:45:40,290 --> 02:45:42,330
Yeah, it does harden fast too.

2353
02:45:42,650 --> 02:45:43,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2354
02:45:43,950 --> 02:45:44,270
Okay.

2355
02:45:45,410 --> 02:45:45,950
All right.

2356
02:45:46,790 --> 02:45:47,830
I'm going to sacrifice.

2357
02:45:48,750 --> 02:45:50,570
I'm going to sacrifice myself.

2358
02:45:57,970 --> 02:45:58,410
Well, wait.

2359
02:45:59,370 --> 02:46:00,010
It's...

2360
02:46:00,010 --> 02:46:00,190
Wait.

2361
02:46:01,230 --> 02:46:01,730
Wait.

2362
02:46:02,990 --> 02:46:03,630
Wait.

2363
02:46:04,910 --> 02:46:05,850
No, Ron.

2364
02:46:06,290 --> 02:46:07,210
What is it?

2365
02:46:08,450 --> 02:46:10,510
Use a pipe cleaner to press it down.

2366
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:11,490
and rip it away.

2367
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:12,170
Oh, maybe.

2368
02:46:12,470 --> 02:46:13,370
Wait, though.

2369
02:46:16,300 --> 02:46:18,200
Only a little, it only sheds a little bit.

2370
02:46:21,060 --> 02:46:22,540
It only sheds a little bit.

2371
02:46:32,550 --> 02:46:33,750
Oh my gosh.

2372
02:46:37,590 --> 02:46:39,290
Okay, this one might be a little bit tougher.

2373
02:46:46,010 --> 02:46:48,410
Okay, we lost some in the process, but that's okay.

2374
02:46:50,270 --> 02:46:50,770
That's okay.

2375
02:46:54,170 --> 02:46:54,730
That's okay.

2376
02:46:55,170 --> 02:46:56,570
It's only... There we go.

2377
02:46:57,150 --> 02:46:57,610
There we go.

2378
02:46:58,130 --> 02:46:58,130
Nice!

2379
02:46:59,350 --> 02:47:03,010
And we'll put some, we'll put some, like, down here too.

2380
02:47:03,470 --> 02:47:04,470
This one's a pretty big stand.

2381
02:47:04,670 --> 02:47:06,950
We can, uh, separate you.

2382
02:47:07,810 --> 02:47:08,890
Put some down there.

2383
02:47:09,830 --> 02:47:10,510
Nice and bloody.

2384
02:47:11,210 --> 02:47:12,130
Nice and bloody!

2385
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:13,930
Mmm, kawaii.

2386
02:47:14,550 --> 02:47:14,570
Kawaii?

2387
02:47:14,570 --> 02:47:17,010
Kawaii, kawaii, kawaii kawaii.

2388
02:47:19,650 --> 02:47:20,790
Kawaii, I think.

2389
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:32,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wait, I just called myself a genius, and now, oh, no, everything's gone bad.

2390
02:47:32,790 --> 02:47:34,610
Uh-oh, the glue gun has gone rogue, everybody.

2391
02:47:35,150 --> 02:47:36,210
Oh, go, ow, ah!

2392
02:47:54,020 --> 02:47:56,300
It's fine, it looks more natural this way, right?

2393
02:47:57,260 --> 02:47:59,020
It looks more natural.

2394
02:48:00,240 --> 02:48:01,700
Oh, gosh, she's really shedding now.

2395
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:02,880
Oh, gosh, okay.

2396
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:04,040
We're fine.

2397
02:48:05,640 --> 02:48:06,440
We're fine.

2398
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:11,340
There we go!

2399
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:11,820
Yeah!

2400
02:48:14,510 --> 02:48:16,410
How many hand puppets have you made?

2401
02:48:16,990 --> 02:48:18,730
Oh, um...

2402
02:48:19,410 --> 02:48:19,910
Two!

2403
02:48:21,790 --> 02:48:22,130
Oh!

2404
02:48:22,650 --> 02:48:24,030
Pick number three, my lord.

2405
02:48:25,710 --> 02:48:25,710
Three!

2406
02:48:27,550 --> 02:48:28,270
I made three.

2407
02:48:30,130 --> 02:48:30,450
Three!

2408
02:48:30,790 --> 02:48:32,210
Pick number three, my lord.

2409
02:48:33,210 --> 02:48:33,870
To-toi!

2410
02:48:34,290 --> 02:48:34,670
Nah.

2411
02:48:41,010 --> 02:48:42,670
As in, this is number two.

2412
02:48:56,770 --> 02:48:57,070
Okay.

2413
02:48:57,870 --> 02:48:58,510
One more to glue.

2414
02:48:59,990 --> 02:49:00,850
One more blood.

2415
02:49:00,990 --> 02:49:02,470
And then we can make her vampire cape.

2416
02:49:03,870 --> 02:49:04,970
Honestly, I don't even...

2417
02:49:04,970 --> 02:49:06,450
Does she need the cape at this point?

2418
02:49:06,850 --> 02:49:08,850
She looks so good as is.

2419
02:49:09,210 --> 02:49:09,990
She looks so...

2420
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:11,690
No, I want her to have a bit of a costume.

2421
02:49:12,710 --> 02:49:15,850
Doki had fur, so Nimi gets her cape.

2422
02:49:18,090 --> 02:49:18,370
You know?

2423
02:49:18,990 --> 02:49:19,950
That's how it works.

2424
02:49:22,090 --> 02:49:22,510
Okay.

2425
02:49:24,890 --> 02:49:27,530
This is neat for Nimmi and 2.

2426
02:49:28,750 --> 02:49:30,150
Her neck needs reinforcement.

2427
02:49:30,330 --> 02:49:31,650
What are you talking about?

2428
02:49:34,130 --> 02:49:34,670
Reinforcement.

2429
02:49:36,170 --> 02:49:37,870
What are you talking about?

2430
02:49:39,470 --> 02:49:40,550
Piece to piece.

2431
02:49:41,190 --> 02:49:41,730
Sanchez!

2432
02:49:41,830 --> 02:49:43,050
Thank you so much for the hugger so much.

2433
02:49:43,290 --> 02:49:43,850
Thank you.

2434
02:49:44,010 --> 02:49:44,490
Thank you.

2435
02:49:44,870 --> 02:49:45,090
Thank you.

2436
02:49:46,090 --> 02:49:47,170
Thank you.

2437
02:49:47,690 --> 02:49:52,630
Thank you.

2438
02:49:52,630 --> 02:49:53,210
Okay.

2439
02:49:53,530 --> 02:49:57,470
Oh my gosh, I can't get over how good the blood ended up looking.

2440
02:49:58,590 --> 02:49:59,110
Wow.

2441
02:49:59,930 --> 02:50:01,090
Good job team!

2442
02:50:01,590 --> 02:50:02,310
Good job!

2443
02:50:02,630 --> 02:50:03,950
Good job!

2444
02:50:06,710 --> 02:50:07,230
Okay.

2445
02:50:07,910 --> 02:50:13,530
Lastly, is her cape.

2446
02:50:14,030 --> 02:50:14,550
All right, hold on.

2447
02:50:14,650 --> 02:50:16,470
I can close out of some of this stuff.

2448
02:50:21,170 --> 02:50:21,650
Oh, here we go.

2449
02:50:32,240 --> 02:51:00,940
because she's a vampire she needs a vampire cape why did I put the other oh here the pom-poms her cake no not her cake vampires can't have cake too much garlic okay um what was I doing oh I remember

2450
02:51:05,450 --> 02:51:10,490
Oh, I can't tell.

2451
02:51:10,750 --> 02:51:13,050
I was trying to see how long I've been streaming for.

2452
02:51:13,370 --> 02:51:13,650
That's all.

2453
02:51:14,290 --> 02:51:16,230
I guess I could have just asked you guys.

2454
02:51:18,070 --> 02:51:21,270
Like, YouTube changed the back-end layout, so I can't tell anything anymore.

2455
02:51:22,470 --> 02:51:24,090
Like, where anything is or what?

2456
02:51:24,190 --> 02:51:25,890
Like, I was like, where's the stream time?

2457
02:51:26,290 --> 02:51:28,190
Or, oh, I'm lost!

2458
02:51:28,570 --> 02:51:29,350
I'm lost!

2459
02:51:30,430 --> 02:51:31,670
Okay, 15 minutes.

2460
02:51:31,810 --> 02:51:32,630
Thank you, thank you.

2461
02:51:33,630 --> 02:51:34,510
Okay, cape.

2462
02:51:35,470 --> 02:51:37,350
We need black and we need red.

2463
02:51:37,430 --> 02:51:39,110
Let me go get the red real quick.

2464
02:51:39,750 --> 02:51:40,190
No,

2465
02:51:45,250 --> 02:51:48,530
because I want to be fancy and I want to line the black.

2466
02:51:50,270 --> 02:51:54,650
Uh, I want to line it like it's a true vampire cape, you know?

2467
02:51:55,490 --> 02:51:55,830
Okay.

2468
02:52:00,210 --> 02:52:03,290
Uh, I know I had a smaller piece of the black felt.

2469
02:52:03,510 --> 02:52:03,710
Where did it?

2470
02:52:03,730 --> 02:52:04,210
Oh, here it is.

2471
02:52:06,970 --> 02:52:09,630
I know, so fancy, so fancy.

2472
02:52:11,710 --> 02:52:14,210
This should be just enough.

2473
02:52:15,110 --> 02:52:15,130
Oh!

2474
02:52:19,430 --> 02:52:21,210
There's red fuzz everywhere.

2475
02:52:26,060 --> 02:52:28,720
And then I'll do...

2476
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:30,180
She will have neck reinforcement.

2477
02:52:30,420 --> 02:52:31,800
It will be from the cape.

2478
02:52:34,460 --> 02:52:43,020
And then I'll line the cape so that the back is black, but the inside is red like so.

2479
02:52:44,420 --> 02:52:47,600
And then when you turn her around, it'll be black.

2480
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:49,680
Oh, I forgot to do the back of her hair.

2481
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:54,160
Um...

2482
02:52:54,160 --> 02:52:55,680
Let me do that real quick.

2483
02:52:58,630 --> 02:52:59,950
I at least did that for Doki.

2484
02:53:02,030 --> 02:53:04,450
Can we get a Mike's to class at all?

2485
02:53:05,690 --> 02:53:11,550
It'll be like, all right, I'm Mike's to class at all.

2486
02:53:11,730 --> 02:53:13,390
Bald Nimi, bald Nimi.

2487
02:53:15,390 --> 02:53:18,130
I mean, just trace the outline of her head.

2488
02:53:21,330 --> 02:53:21,990
I should have done that.

2489
02:53:22,030 --> 02:53:23,110
Why didn't I do this with Doki?

2490
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:26,450
Okay.

2491
02:53:27,990 --> 02:53:29,430
Why didn't I do this with Doki?

2492
02:53:30,450 --> 02:53:33,530
Oh, I already closed out of her reference.

2493
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:34,030
Hold on.

2494
02:53:38,500 --> 02:53:38,900
Okay.

2495
02:53:42,040 --> 02:53:43,220
It's really just like...

2496
02:53:48,480 --> 02:53:50,760
I don't want to make it too difficult for myself.

2497
02:53:53,780 --> 02:53:59,140
Okie dokie Let's Except I already finished dokie We're on Nime.

2498
02:54:00,460 --> 02:54:00,980
Let's cut

2499
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:26,820
We were trusting the process We really I think it's because the first one Was the front The bangs were so stinking good That like I was like I have an eye for this I'm a genius And so I just trusted it And you know It mostly worked I have a feeling Mike would only Agreed to a puppet if his puppet got a beer.

2500
02:54:27,820 --> 02:54:28,700
I agree.

2501
02:54:29,480 --> 02:54:31,340
I mean, it has to have a beer.

2502
02:54:32,540 --> 02:54:34,120
It's like part of his appeal.

2503
02:54:42,790 --> 02:54:44,950
Did you see me just twirl this around?

2504
02:54:45,310 --> 02:54:47,510
Like, you know when dogs are trying to get comfortable?

2505
02:54:47,970 --> 02:54:48,870
I'm like, hmm.

2506
02:54:52,910 --> 02:54:55,030
Trying to find the sweet spot.

2507
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:08,040
That's me.

2508
02:55:09,520 --> 02:55:10,860
Gotta finesse it first.

2509
02:55:11,220 --> 02:55:11,740
Right, right.

2510
02:55:11,960 --> 02:55:13,720
I gotta feel what...

2511
02:55:13,720 --> 02:55:14,900
I gotta feel it out.

2512
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:17,160
Know what feels right in my hand.

2513
02:55:17,660 --> 02:55:19,080
Are you guys feeling spooky?

2514
02:55:19,540 --> 02:55:21,520
Are you guys feeling the Halloween spirit?

2515
02:55:22,020 --> 02:55:24,200
Lots of people have been doing Halloween stuff, so...

2516
02:55:24,860 --> 02:55:26,920
I love when people do seasonal things.

2517
02:55:27,100 --> 02:55:27,800
It's so fun.

2518
02:55:28,100 --> 02:55:30,220
What's great about Halloween, too, is because...

2519
02:55:30,220 --> 02:55:34,100
I mean, I like to do the crafts, the Halloween crafts, but...

2520
02:55:34,200 --> 02:55:37,780
You also get, like, spooky games and everything, and...

2521
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:39,040
Yeah, you're getting there!

2522
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:41,840
You know what would really get you there?

2523
02:55:43,120 --> 02:55:43,820
A pumpkin.

2524
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:46,320
You gotta get yourself a pumpkin.

2525
02:55:47,760 --> 02:55:50,200
That makes everything feel...

2526
02:55:50,820 --> 02:55:52,340
Like, fall and Halloween.

2527
02:55:53,360 --> 02:55:54,320
That's, like, the key.

2528
02:55:54,680 --> 02:55:58,520
As soon as you stop getting pumpkins, it doesn't feel like Halloween anymore.

2529
02:55:58,900 --> 02:56:01,080
You gotta get yourself a pumpkin.

2530
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:05,260
Horror Nights last week.

2531
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:07,840
How was it?

2532
02:56:08,440 --> 02:56:09,240
How was it?

2533
02:56:09,360 --> 02:56:10,380
Oh my gosh.

2534
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:12,980
I've had a pumpkin on my desk for a month.

2535
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:14,060
So true.

2536
02:56:14,540 --> 02:56:14,920
Yeah!

2537
02:56:18,700 --> 02:56:22,380
Mimi, one day I'll make you a puppet.

2538
02:56:22,780 --> 02:56:26,640
And then when I see you again, I'll give it to you.

2539
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:33,700
But maybe you're already a witch, so it wouldn't be a Halloween one, maybe.

2540
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:34,980
Maybe just a regular one.

2541
02:56:39,620 --> 02:56:40,520
Oh, shut up.

2542
02:56:41,860 --> 02:56:44,200
Speaking of Halloween, when's the Over the Garden Wall Watch Along?

2543
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:45,660
It is!

2544
02:56:46,140 --> 02:56:50,640
Hold on, let me check my account.

2545
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:54,180
The 26th.

2546
02:56:54,300 --> 02:56:54,880
It's a Sunday.

2547
02:56:57,280 --> 02:57:03,000
Sunday, the 26th, is when I'll do a member's Watch Along of Over the Garden Wall.

2548
02:57:05,400 --> 02:57:05,860
Wow!

2549
02:57:06,660 --> 02:57:07,160
Wait!

2550
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:31,340
I just realized how much of genius i am and you can see the little hair flippy wait actually i'm gonna flip it around so that it's clean this is so good oh ah thank you guys for the gift thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

2551
02:57:37,960 --> 02:57:55,600
doki was truly like our test subject and Nimmy is our perfect child it's just how it goes you don't know what you're doing with the first one and then you have another kid you still don't know what you're doing

2552
02:58:01,080 --> 02:58:18,160
randomish question did you ever play franbow I haven't played franbow only a little misfortune but there's a game coming out that has franbow and little misfortune in it I should play it so I can play the new game.

2553
02:58:23,650 --> 02:58:24,650
Mimi's turning out amazing.

2554
02:58:24,890 --> 02:58:26,410
I know, I'm shocked.

2555
02:58:29,610 --> 02:58:33,150
There's a little bit of her head up top with some glue.

2556
02:58:33,570 --> 02:58:35,230
But it's fine, you can't tell.

2557
02:58:39,590 --> 02:58:40,030
And

2558
02:58:43,510 --> 02:58:45,230
what happened with you?

2559
02:58:46,230 --> 02:58:48,490
Actually, I know, I still think Doki looks pretty cute, though.

2560
02:58:49,810 --> 02:58:51,250
Okay, well, we're not done yet.

2561
02:58:52,110 --> 02:58:53,030
We're not done yet.

2562
02:58:57,320 --> 02:58:58,920
Why was I putting on her hair?

2563
02:59:00,500 --> 02:59:01,760
Oh, I guess for the cape.

2564
02:59:05,750 --> 02:59:07,830
Don't scare us that Naruto.

2565
02:59:10,550 --> 02:59:10,910
No!

2566
02:59:13,390 --> 02:59:15,130
But in my first attempt.

2567
02:59:16,510 --> 02:59:17,270
Oh my gosh.

2568
02:59:17,410 --> 02:59:17,690
I am.

2569
02:59:17,850 --> 02:59:18,730
Thank you so much for the music.

2570
02:59:19,450 --> 02:59:20,950
Thank you so much.

2571
02:59:21,030 --> 02:59:21,710
Thank you.

2572
02:59:24,130 --> 02:59:25,350
Thank you!

2573
02:59:25,910 --> 02:59:27,910
Thank you!

2574
02:59:28,910 --> 02:59:30,350
Doki Doki.

2575
02:59:33,990 --> 02:59:34,350
Uh...

2576
02:59:34,710 --> 02:59:36,070
We trace her body.

2577
02:59:40,150 --> 02:59:41,110
Doki, that's it by yo!

2578
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:48,030
Oh no!

2579
02:59:53,290 --> 02:59:54,010
Actually,

2580
02:59:57,510 --> 03:00:02,750
since it's a cape, I just need to get like And I don't need to do the arms.

2581
03:00:03,530 --> 03:00:03,790
You know?

2582
03:00:04,690 --> 03:00:07,070
We just need to do the outline of it.

2583
03:00:08,910 --> 03:00:09,850
Outline of her.

2584
03:00:10,790 --> 03:00:13,090
The shape of Nimi Nightmare.

2585
03:00:15,970 --> 03:00:18,670
Maybe I shouldn't have done this though with...

2586
03:00:18,670 --> 03:00:19,570
Okay, hold on.

2587
03:00:28,370 --> 03:00:29,150
Like so.

2588
03:00:29,850 --> 03:00:31,150
Yeah, yeah, this looks good.

2589
03:00:32,370 --> 03:00:32,990
That looks fine.

2590
03:00:33,110 --> 03:00:33,650
That looks fine.

2591
03:00:34,070 --> 03:00:34,770
It's just a cape.

2592
03:00:34,910 --> 03:00:35,530
It's just a cape.

2593
03:00:36,510 --> 03:00:36,850
Okay.

2594
03:00:37,170 --> 03:00:37,370
Okay.

2595
03:00:38,210 --> 03:00:41,570
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

2596
03:00:41,890 --> 03:00:42,730
That there.

2597
03:00:43,450 --> 03:00:44,230
It's just a cape.

2598
03:00:45,830 --> 03:00:46,790
I could have made it...

2599
03:00:46,790 --> 03:00:48,290
Actually, I can make it a little wider.

2600
03:00:50,690 --> 03:00:53,630
We can make it a little my wider so it sticks out more.

2601
03:00:54,530 --> 03:00:55,130
Like that.

2602
03:00:57,610 --> 03:00:57,970
And

2603
03:01:06,450 --> 03:01:06,810
then...

2604
03:01:06,810 --> 03:01:09,650
Oh, maybe we should have made it a little bit longer, too, but that's okay.

2605
03:01:11,710 --> 03:01:12,590
That's okay, that's okay.

2606
03:01:13,510 --> 03:01:13,850
Ooh!

2607
03:01:14,290 --> 03:01:14,610
Woo!

2608
03:01:14,610 --> 03:01:18,770
You can't scare me.

2609
03:01:19,370 --> 03:01:22,370
I'm a ghost.

2610
03:01:23,350 --> 03:01:26,410
Oh, it's me.

2611
03:01:27,130 --> 03:01:29,650
Nimmy the vampire.

2612
03:01:31,930 --> 03:01:32,630
Okay, hold on.

2613
03:01:32,970 --> 03:01:34,720
Let me do the red lining now.

2614
03:01:45,850 --> 03:01:47,610
Everyone, every good...

2615
03:01:47,610 --> 03:01:47,750
Whoops.

2616
03:01:48,470 --> 03:01:50,530
Every good vampire.

2617
03:01:50,610 --> 03:01:54,910
Where cape means red.

2618
03:01:58,630 --> 03:01:59,150
Woof.

2619
03:01:59,650 --> 03:02:01,990
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

2620
03:02:03,210 --> 03:02:03,830
I'm a dog.

2621
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:12,560
Go begone, begone.

2622
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:15,880
Red like blood.

2623
03:02:17,860 --> 03:02:21,400
I was at Club Iron Mouse last night and it was so hyped to see it perform the best song ever.

2624
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:22,040
Yeah!

2625
03:02:22,460 --> 03:02:23,600
Oh, and Nimi turned out so well.

2626
03:02:24,000 --> 03:02:24,760
Thank you!

2627
03:02:25,080 --> 03:02:26,080
And Doki too, right?

2628
03:02:28,000 --> 03:03:00,860
right and Doki too right yes we don't talk about Doki no we don't talk about Doki bird we don't talk about Doki no no no okay all right all right

2629
03:03:12,900 --> 03:03:14,520
All right!

2630
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:17,500
What is a ghost favorite kind of pie?

2631
03:03:18,280 --> 03:03:19,180
Boo-berry!

2632
03:03:23,040 --> 03:03:23,680
Um...

2633
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:25,300
Actually, it's...

2634
03:03:25,300 --> 03:03:27,060
This is so awkward.

2635
03:03:27,220 --> 03:03:28,900
Oh my gosh, actually...

2636
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:31,360
I like apple pie.

2637
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:32,620
The most.

2638
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:39,060
I don't know how to tell you.

2639
03:03:39,680 --> 03:03:42,400
I mean, I just did.

2640
03:03:43,440 --> 03:03:45,340
I did just tell you.

2641
03:03:46,840 --> 03:03:48,560
Do we share a brain cell?

2642
03:03:49,540 --> 03:03:51,740
Whenever I'm about to make a reference, you do it first.

2643
03:03:52,700 --> 03:03:55,780
You are becoming Minto.

2644
03:03:55,920 --> 03:04:01,220
Every time I possess you, every time I possess you, I just... This is your brain.

2645
03:04:02,760 --> 03:04:04,680
I leave a little bit of traces.

2646
03:04:05,480 --> 03:04:06,300
Wait, this is your brain.

2647
03:04:07,320 --> 03:04:08,460
Sprinkled in there.

2648
03:04:10,080 --> 03:04:10,440
You know?

2649
03:04:13,870 --> 03:04:14,730
Happens to me too.

2650
03:04:14,750 --> 03:04:18,130
Yeah, I'm possessing you too, but I sprinkle it in there.

2651
03:04:23,440 --> 03:04:25,820
I thought I was going to use way more glue.

2652
03:04:26,020 --> 03:04:30,040
But I also thought I was going to be making, like, way more puppets.

2653
03:04:30,720 --> 03:04:37,680
So, I thought I got so much glue.

2654
03:04:38,200 --> 03:04:38,700
That's okay.

2655
03:04:39,800 --> 03:04:41,320
Better to have more than not enough.

2656
03:04:46,550 --> 03:04:47,190
No, I...

2657
03:04:47,190 --> 03:04:50,230
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, brain sprinkles.

2658
03:04:50,750 --> 03:04:52,030
Tax, keep up the good work.

2659
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:56,890
How does the glue taste?

2660
03:04:57,330 --> 03:04:58,390
You try it.

2661
03:04:58,610 --> 03:04:59,130
Try it.

2662
03:05:06,220 --> 03:05:07,080
How's it taste?

2663
03:05:16,140 --> 03:05:16,440
Yummy?

2664
03:05:21,750 --> 03:05:22,850
My tongue hurts.

2665
03:05:23,610 --> 03:05:25,370
Yeah, you should have waited for it to cool.

2666
03:05:26,230 --> 03:05:27,410
Like I told you.

2667
03:05:28,410 --> 03:05:32,610
Next time you listen to Minto, I have some good advice.

2668
03:05:35,270 --> 03:05:37,050
Will I fail my drug test?

2669
03:05:37,070 --> 03:05:38,530
if Minto is in my brain.

2670
03:05:39,190 --> 03:05:43,390
No, no, no, that's ridiculousness.

2671
03:05:59,490 --> 03:06:02,610
All right, let's trim a tad where I messed up.

2672
03:06:07,030 --> 03:06:08,410
And we could do up here.

2673
03:06:09,490 --> 03:06:09,690
Perfect.

2674
03:06:11,090 --> 03:06:13,410
And our cape is complete.

2675
03:06:16,390 --> 03:06:17,210
Nimi, where'd you go?

2676
03:06:18,070 --> 03:06:18,770
Where are you?

2677
03:06:18,930 --> 03:06:19,850
Wait, where did I put Nimi?

2678
03:06:20,530 --> 03:06:22,810
I want

2679
03:06:26,580 --> 03:06:28,640
it under her hair, like so.

2680
03:06:31,640 --> 03:06:32,260
Like this.

2681
03:06:32,620 --> 03:06:32,900
Okay.

2682
03:06:34,720 --> 03:06:38,920
And then we'll do her, the, the, this part.

2683
03:06:41,200 --> 03:06:42,580
Look how good that is.

2684
03:06:45,540 --> 03:06:47,500
It's too good.

2685
03:06:47,740 --> 03:06:48,680
Too good.

2686
03:06:56,470 --> 03:06:58,590
Very, very carefully.

2687
03:07:05,220 --> 03:07:05,840
That's me.

2688
03:07:06,220 --> 03:07:09,180
I'm- I can make all your plushy hand- or not plushy.

2689
03:07:09,320 --> 03:07:13,620
All your- all your hand puppet me-hits.

2690
03:07:14,120 --> 03:07:16,620
The kowtinyin minotaur is next, right?

2691
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:22,140
Okay, now... Oops.

2692
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:26,420
I got glue all over the- the- these other scraps I was gonna use.

2693
03:07:26,900 --> 03:07:27,360
My bad.

2694
03:07:27,560 --> 03:07:28,160
That's fine.

2695
03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:29,600
I have plenty of black.

2696
03:07:30,300 --> 03:07:30,880
Oh, here.

2697
03:07:31,060 --> 03:07:31,820
I have some more here too.

2698
03:07:32,860 --> 03:07:34,120
Actually, I think I was saving this for you.

2699
03:07:34,140 --> 03:07:45,740
the caller perfect okay how do i want to do this for a first try for a first try on your first puppet nimi turned out amazing

2700
03:07:49,580 --> 03:08:03,910
well oh watch this that thank you oh my gosh i that's what i've been putting it trying to put it on the plate this whole time it's fine it's okay it's okay um

2701
03:08:08,160 --> 03:08:10,280
first try

2702
03:08:17,560 --> 03:08:18,960
First try.

2703
03:08:22,180 --> 03:08:24,920
Well, how could I make her look more like Doki?

2704
03:08:31,060 --> 03:08:32,180
Like Doki?

2705
03:08:34,460 --> 03:08:36,540
Is it because of the ears?

2706
03:08:46,400 --> 03:08:48,480
Needs more smug.

2707
03:08:49,260 --> 03:08:51,260
Doki looks fantastic.

2708
03:08:51,460 --> 03:08:52,240
You think so?

2709
03:08:56,380 --> 03:08:58,560
You think so?

2710
03:09:01,220 --> 03:09:08,140
And maybe, like, if you say smug, I could do, like, an upturned mouth.

2711
03:09:10,600 --> 03:09:13,480
I could do an upturned mouth and then, like, the eyebrows.

2712
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:21,900
With different shade of blonde.

2713
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:23,700
We're working with felt here.

2714
03:09:24,160 --> 03:09:25,440
You got it.

2715
03:09:26,480 --> 03:09:28,820
Oh, maybe, like, redo the whole thing.

2716
03:09:31,260 --> 03:09:32,060
She's so distressed.

2717
03:09:32,180 --> 03:09:33,300
I mean, she's a wear kitty.

2718
03:09:34,060 --> 03:09:34,640
Alright, okay.

2719
03:09:35,400 --> 03:09:37,260
We'll make her...

2720
03:09:46,170 --> 03:09:46,910
Like that?

2721
03:09:57,130 --> 03:09:58,890
How do I have so much felt on this?

2722
03:10:00,670 --> 03:10:02,090
Oh, my poor fingers.

2723
03:10:09,220 --> 03:10:13,300
You can't even see that she has whiskers because of the collar.

2724
03:10:17,550 --> 03:10:18,730
Can you do her gloves?

2725
03:10:18,810 --> 03:10:20,670
Wait, let me go back to my Doki reference.

2726
03:10:22,930 --> 03:10:24,190
I downloaded everybody.

2727
03:10:24,210 --> 03:10:26,330
and I've only got two done, man.

2728
03:10:30,800 --> 03:10:31,460
Oh, we're a fang.

2729
03:10:31,640 --> 03:10:32,320
Yeah, I could do that.

2730
03:10:32,420 --> 03:10:33,140
I could do that.

2731
03:10:39,940 --> 03:10:45,240
Give her a fang and make her mouth open because her mouth is always open for some reason.

2732
03:10:45,680 --> 03:10:45,680
Okay.

2733
03:10:50,680 --> 03:10:52,420
Oh, I made it kind of big.

2734
03:11:01,900 --> 03:11:02,900
Guys, look what up.

2735
03:11:02,940 --> 03:11:03,480
This is.

2736
03:11:03,740 --> 03:11:04,700
Look at my fingers.

2737
03:11:05,800 --> 03:11:06,780
Oh, my gosh.

2738
03:11:09,840 --> 03:11:10,240
Maybe?

2739
03:11:13,500 --> 03:11:13,900
Looking good?

2740
03:11:14,060 --> 03:11:15,120
Don't say d'Ate bayou!

2741
03:11:19,990 --> 03:11:21,990
I wonder if I could do her gloves.

2742
03:11:22,410 --> 03:11:23,310
I'm trying to think of what else I...

2743
03:11:23,310 --> 03:11:25,090
Maybe I could do like the...

2744
03:11:25,970 --> 03:11:28,710
I could do like her belts and stuff across her too.

2745
03:11:28,870 --> 03:11:29,390
Hold on.

2746
03:11:31,450 --> 03:11:32,530
I have the brown.

2747
03:11:33,990 --> 03:11:36,390
Let me do... let me do her belts.

2748
03:11:47,970 --> 03:11:49,450
That should be enough, right?

2749
03:11:50,450 --> 03:11:50,850
Probably?

2750
03:11:53,590 --> 03:11:56,930
Oh, wait, okay, wait, I need two, I need one more.

2751
03:11:59,210 --> 03:12:00,230
Wait, wait, wait.

2752
03:12:04,400 --> 03:12:06,700
It's looking better already, I think.

2753
03:12:21,570 --> 03:12:22,010
Wait.

2754
03:12:24,570 --> 03:12:25,890
He's the good one.

2755
03:12:31,640 --> 03:12:32,360
Uh-oh, wait.

2756
03:12:32,540 --> 03:12:33,420
I messed up, I think.

2757
03:12:33,880 --> 03:12:34,220
Oh, no.

2758
03:12:35,040 --> 03:12:35,740
Oh, no, I didn't.

2759
03:12:35,960 --> 03:12:36,900
Okay, just enough.

2760
03:12:37,360 --> 03:12:37,820
Just enough.

2761
03:12:37,940 --> 03:12:38,120
Perfect.

2762
03:12:38,980 --> 03:12:39,820
Okay, glue.

2763
03:12:41,560 --> 03:12:42,860
It's not Naruto.

2764
03:12:46,200 --> 03:12:48,040
You guys are gonna make me cry.

2765
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:49,840
At least this was my first attempt.

2766
03:12:52,360 --> 03:12:56,900
If it were like, if I was, what if I came in being like, guys, I'm a professional puppet maker.

2767
03:12:58,800 --> 03:13:02,820
I've made thousands of puppets in my afterlife time.

2768
03:13:08,190 --> 03:13:10,350
Oops, I did it the wrong way, but that's okay.

2769
03:13:20,740 --> 03:13:21,380
Sneak that out.

2770
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:21,860
Yay!

2771
03:13:22,900 --> 03:13:23,120
Okay!

2772
03:13:23,980 --> 03:13:24,780
It's looking a bit better?

2773
03:13:25,800 --> 03:13:26,680
Right, right!

2774
03:13:27,880 --> 03:13:29,380
It's looking a bit better, right!

2775
03:13:38,180 --> 03:13:39,580
Outline the ears more.

2776
03:13:40,380 --> 03:13:41,320
Yeah, I'll try.

2777
03:13:42,860 --> 03:13:43,540
I'll try.

2778
03:13:44,180 --> 03:13:45,520
How can I do that though?

2779
03:13:46,200 --> 03:13:46,200
Hmm.

2780
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:48,020
Maybe if I...

2781
03:13:48,020 --> 03:13:49,260
Wait, hold on, let me try something.

2782
03:13:50,140 --> 03:13:50,820
Let me try this.

2783
03:13:51,260 --> 03:13:52,860
What if I give her like some white tuft?

2784
03:13:53,660 --> 03:13:53,980
You know?

2785
03:13:55,900 --> 03:13:56,660
Like this.

2786
03:13:59,620 --> 03:14:01,760
Oh, wait, wait, wait, like that.

2787
03:14:11,260 --> 03:14:13,260
I'll fix it, but...

2788
03:14:13,260 --> 03:14:13,840
Okay, okay.

2789
03:14:15,400 --> 03:14:15,980
Hold on, Nimmy.

2790
03:14:16,160 --> 03:14:17,200
I need you to move, please.

2791
03:14:19,980 --> 03:14:20,520
Wait.

2792
03:14:22,580 --> 03:14:24,240
Nimmy was so close to perfection.

2793
03:14:25,500 --> 03:14:26,840
We're so close to finishing her.

2794
03:14:29,040 --> 03:14:30,900
But Doki needs emergency surgery.

2795
03:14:32,720 --> 03:14:35,100
Don't kiddie needs emergency surgery!

2796
03:14:38,460 --> 03:14:40,040
It's not Boruto.

2797
03:14:46,430 --> 03:14:49,430
I'll bet this person's life on it, whoever I'm possessing.

2798
03:15:00,170 --> 03:15:01,530
She's coming back!

2799
03:15:01,650 --> 03:15:02,530
She's coming back!

2800
03:15:03,850 --> 03:15:05,530
We're not losing her!

2801
03:15:11,570 --> 03:15:13,730
I can fix her!

2802
03:15:13,810 --> 03:15:15,770
I can fix her!

2803
03:15:15,950 --> 03:15:16,610
I can fix her!

2804
03:15:17,390 --> 03:15:19,890
A little bit more.

2805
03:15:28,820 --> 03:15:29,340
Oops.

2806
03:15:30,120 --> 03:15:30,380
Whatever.

2807
03:15:31,100 --> 03:15:31,500
It's fine.

2808
03:15:37,590 --> 03:15:38,890
Yeah, yeah, there we go, there we go.

2809
03:15:40,310 --> 03:15:41,530
Dr. Freakin' Stein!

2810
03:15:41,970 --> 03:15:43,870
She is alive!

2811
03:15:44,410 --> 03:15:45,710
Get the side drip!

2812
03:15:48,070 --> 03:15:48,950
Oops, sorry.

2813
03:15:53,570 --> 03:15:57,530
I mean, her expression, she really looks like she's losing, like she's dying, though.

2814
03:15:58,250 --> 03:16:02,270
Her expression alone makes me look like, makes me feel like we're losing her.

2815
03:16:05,730 --> 03:16:06,710
How about that?

2816
03:16:06,910 --> 03:16:08,130
That looks better, I think.

2817
03:16:13,170 --> 03:16:14,670
What else can I add?

2818
03:16:17,630 --> 03:16:20,510
I like how I included her undershirt.

2819
03:16:21,730 --> 03:16:23,630
But I did not click.

2820
03:16:24,170 --> 03:16:25,890
I gave her the hair.

2821
03:16:42,210 --> 03:16:43,550
Guys, I don't know what to tell you.

2822
03:16:43,730 --> 03:16:46,810
I think it's just Doki Bird looks like Naruto.

2823
03:16:48,030 --> 03:16:49,370
It's not me.

2824
03:16:49,890 --> 03:16:50,590
It's her.

2825
03:16:51,270 --> 03:16:53,870
Like, you can blame Doki Bird's design.

2826
03:16:54,710 --> 03:16:56,550
I think she just looks like Naruto.

2827
03:16:59,890 --> 03:17:01,290
Don't blame me.

2828
03:17:02,370 --> 03:17:03,350
Blame Doki.

2829
03:17:06,250 --> 03:17:27,440

well that's dokitty we're dokitty and now we finish vampire nimi we get locked back in everybody we're locked We just have, we just have, probably I'll do like this.

2831
03:17:49,050 --> 03:17:50,530
Okay, I think I know how I'm gonna do this.

2832
03:17:52,410 --> 03:17:54,230
Doesn't have to be very tall.

2833
03:17:56,710 --> 03:17:58,090
Oh gosh, okay.

2834
03:18:00,250 --> 03:18:01,870
Maybe like here.

2835
03:18:06,850 --> 03:18:07,190
There.

2836
03:18:08,510 --> 03:18:11,050
If I mess up, if I mess up, it's fine.

2837
03:18:11,730 --> 03:18:12,110
Nibbi!

2838
03:18:12,770 --> 03:18:13,890
Oh my gosh, down blinks!

2839
03:18:14,510 --> 03:18:14,570
Look!

2840
03:18:17,270 --> 03:18:19,110
I made you into a vampire!

2841
03:18:30,030 --> 03:18:32,550
You go from one nimi to the next.

2842
03:18:34,010 --> 03:18:35,770
Except this one's a vampire!

2843
03:18:37,190 --> 03:18:37,970
For Halloween!

2844
03:18:38,450 --> 03:18:39,690
That's her Halloween costume.

2845
03:18:40,070 --> 03:18:40,550
Wait, I can't...

2846
03:18:41,490 --> 03:18:42,230
I can't see.

2847
03:18:42,850 --> 03:18:45,630
Why did it get... Oh, I was like, why is it getting so dark in my room?

2848
03:18:45,710 --> 03:18:47,910
It's because I have like dimming lights.

2849
03:18:50,030 --> 03:18:52,350
Means it's time for me to shut down soon.

2850
03:18:53,230 --> 03:18:55,230
I was like, I can't see though, I can't see.

2851
03:18:56,170 --> 03:18:56,730
Okay.

2852
03:18:58,450 --> 03:18:59,330
Thank you guys.

2853
03:18:59,710 --> 03:18:59,910
Whoa.

2854
03:19:00,530 --> 03:19:00,810
Hello.

2855
03:19:01,230 --> 03:19:01,430
Hello.

2856
03:19:02,230 --> 03:19:02,490
Hello.

2857
03:19:05,310 --> 03:19:06,690
I possessed some.

2858
03:19:06,930 --> 03:19:08,890
You're probably like, oh my gosh.

2859
03:19:10,310 --> 03:19:11,610
Minto is not a ghost.

2860
03:19:11,930 --> 03:19:12,170
No, no.

2861
03:19:12,250 --> 03:19:13,470
I possessed someone today.

2862
03:19:13,590 --> 03:19:17,990

2875

Alright.

2876
03:20:11,750 --> 03:20:12,150
Wait!

2877
03:20:12,730 --> 03:20:13,090
Okay.

2878
03:20:13,570 --> 03:20:14,950
And then...

2879
03:20:14,950 --> 03:20:15,210
It

2880
03:20:20,230 --> 03:20:23,350
might be a little short, but it's fine probably.

2881
03:20:33,070 --> 03:20:33,410
Blah!

2882
03:20:33,630 --> 03:20:33,970
Blah!

2883
03:20:34,290 --> 03:20:35,950
She's here to soak your blood!

2884
03:20:37,690 --> 03:20:39,190
And eat your nightmare!

2885
03:20:42,030 --> 03:20:43,670
Actually, I'm going to cut it a little bit.

2886
03:20:43,870 --> 03:20:45,670
So, wait, actually, no, it's fine the way it is.

2887
03:20:46,290 --> 03:20:49,230
She's here to suck your blood and enter nightmares.

2888
03:20:50,230 --> 03:20:50,890
Blah, blah.

2889
03:20:53,310 --> 03:20:57,190
I can bring it down just a tad, probably.

2890
03:20:57,790 --> 03:20:59,930
Give her a little bit more neck, maybe.

2891
03:21:03,390 --> 03:21:05,110
Yes, yes, yes.

2892
03:21:06,090 --> 03:21:07,050
Happy Halloween.

2893
03:21:20,530 --> 03:21:21,650
Like so?

2894
03:21:25,800 --> 03:21:27,140
They don't need more neck.

2895
03:21:28,120 --> 03:21:29,440
It's my art style.

2896
03:21:29,640 --> 03:21:31,320
Are you judging my art style?

2897
03:21:33,080 --> 03:21:35,400
Are you saying I need to go back to art school?

2898
03:21:38,280 --> 03:21:40,060
My degree is useless?

2899
03:21:41,860 --> 03:21:45,100
I love no-neck women.

2900
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:47,140
That's why it's my art style.

2901
03:21:55,170 --> 03:21:57,270
Can we eat the extra glue sticks?

2902
03:21:57,990 --> 03:21:59,990
Oh, I just ran out.

2903
03:22:00,870 --> 03:22:02,730
You know, I also got this to try it.

2904
03:22:02,750 --> 03:22:04,030
I got this pen to try.

2905
03:22:04,150 --> 03:22:04,950
Wait, I want to use it.

2906
03:22:05,050 --> 03:22:06,870
I wanted to try and make my own hair.

2907
03:22:08,130 --> 03:22:08,870
Let's try it.

2908
03:22:09,590 --> 03:22:10,430
How it would look.

2909
03:22:14,270 --> 03:22:16,610
Wait, it would look so good!

2910
03:22:18,350 --> 03:22:18,790
Wait.

2911
03:22:21,910 --> 03:22:23,010
Oh my god.

2912
03:22:23,170 --> 03:22:25,310
Maybe I do need to do another stream then.

2913
03:22:29,130 --> 03:22:29,130
Maybe.

2914
03:22:29,310 --> 03:22:32,710
It doesn't show up very well on the camera, but...

2915
03:22:32,710 --> 03:22:32,950
Whoa!

2916
03:22:33,610 --> 03:22:35,030
I picked the perfect color!

2917
03:22:37,610 --> 03:22:38,290
Tombow.

2918
03:22:39,830 --> 03:22:40,510
Tombow.

2919
03:22:42,650 --> 03:22:43,510
Well, guys.

2920
03:22:46,610 --> 03:22:48,050
Uh, hold one moment.

2921
03:22:53,850 --> 03:22:55,110
I'm cleaning up.

2922
03:22:57,510 --> 03:23:00,070
I made two friends today.

2923
03:23:01,590 --> 03:23:03,150
I made two friends.

2924
03:23:03,310 --> 03:23:06,770
We made Nibbi as a vampire for Halloween.

2925
03:23:07,010 --> 03:23:10,270
And we made Doki Bird as a...

2926
03:23:11,390 --> 03:23:13,090
As a...

2927
03:23:13,090 --> 03:23:14,190
Wear Kitty.

2928
03:23:16,110 --> 03:23:17,990
No, it's not Naruto.

2929
03:23:23,640 --> 03:23:24,520
So...

2930
03:23:24,520 --> 03:23:27,360
Those are their Halloween costumes.

2931
03:23:28,340 --> 03:23:29,760
Decided by me.

2932
03:23:30,460 --> 03:23:32,000
I think you discovered a hidden talent today, Minky.

2933
03:23:32,260 --> 03:23:33,080
These came out so good.

2934
03:23:33,200 --> 03:23:34,000
You think so?

2935
03:23:34,580 --> 03:23:36,340
I'm really proud of the Nimeo one.

2936
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:37,560
I'm not gonna lie.

2937
03:23:38,180 --> 03:23:39,580
We need more arts and crafts, dreams.

2938
03:23:40,100 --> 03:23:41,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2939
03:23:42,340 --> 03:23:43,260
Do the eyes shake?

2940
03:23:43,440 --> 03:23:43,800
They do.

2941
03:23:45,640 --> 03:23:55,480
Ooh, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, the awesome stream.

2945
03:25:07,180 --> 03:25:07,400
What?

2946
03:25:17,390 --> 03:25:18,170

It's a choking bird.

2956
03:25:36,430 --> 03:25:37,730
It's choking bird.

2957
03:25:43,150 --> 03:25:44,750
Here's for the Naruto.

2958
03:25:45,710 --> 03:25:47,130
Anyways, bye-bye.

Oh no, I'm making them kiss.

2965
03:26:26,870 --> 03:26:28,630
I can't.

2966
03:26:28,990 --> 03:26:31,650
My thumb doesn't reach up here.

2967
03:26:44,030 --> 03:26:44,910
Okay.

2968
03:26:45,350 --> 03:26:46,090
