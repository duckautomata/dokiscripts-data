1
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:37,520
I stare at the stars, and the sky above, and think, what am I made of?

2
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,820
Am I full of sorrow?

3
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,720
Am I hurt and pain?

4
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:52,800
Or am I filled with love?

5
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:07,380
I walk by myself on the streets below, and ask every child I know.

6
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:16,840
Do you think tomorrow will bring sun or rain?

7
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,400
Which one of these will show?

8
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:31,700
I can't say goodbye to yesterday, my friend.

9
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
I keep holding on till the end.

10
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:52,240
Out of the darkness, there is no other way than the light leading to yesterday.

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:12,460
It's there that I'll find inner peace, not war, and dreams that I let slip away.

12
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:26,740
I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for, way back in yesterday.

13
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,340
Of day.

14
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,800
For day.

15
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,460
Alright,

16
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:00,780
dear, give me a grace.

17
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,620
And this is the second one.

18
00:03:30,780 --> 00:04:37,880
Why can't each of us in the world ever see The best things in life are free Little sounds of laughter, a warm hug A smile, a kiss from you to me I fall to my knees I cry and I cry Love, do not pass me by Happy ever after Please stay for a while Make time perfume Use to fly I can't say goodbye to yesterday,

19
00:04:39,120 --> 00:05:36,200
my friend Cause I know how good it has been Facing forever, here I stand Come on in, in the old In the new yesterday It's there that I'll find Inner peace, not war And dreams that I let slip away I will find the joyfulness I'm looking for Way back to yesterday

20
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,030
I'll see

21
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,350
you next time.
