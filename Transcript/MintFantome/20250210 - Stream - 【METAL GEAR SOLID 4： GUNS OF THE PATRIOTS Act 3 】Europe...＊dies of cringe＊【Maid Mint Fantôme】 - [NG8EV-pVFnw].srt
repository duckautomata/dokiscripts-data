1
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,200
Never fear!

2
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,320
Minto is here!

3
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,720
Hey party people!

4
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,220
Hello, hello, hello!

5
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,080
Welcome back!

6
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,740
I'm back!

7
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Welcome back!

8
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,060
Welcome, welcome back to Metal Gear Solid 4!

9
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh, Spank!

10
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,480
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

11
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,420
You're so quick!

12
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,500
We just started!

13
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,020
Thank you!

14
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,520
The frills are back.

15
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,560
And they're back to stay, baby!

16
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,160
They're back to stay!

17
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,740
Hi!

18
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,780
It's like a red dress.

19
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,200
Wait, ask, does JPEGDog help you make it?

20
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,200
Damn!

21
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,900
Thank you for 20 gifted too!

22
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,660
Thank you!

23
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,820
Guys, I have a confession to make.

24
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,140
I have a confession to make.

25
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,020
I...

26
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,160
I didn't think it would cause such a ruckus.

27
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,860
I thought that maybe...

28
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,080
People would be like...

29
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,580
Oh Minto, you're so silly!

30
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,080
With your silly idea, you...

31
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,080
I thought that maybe...

32
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,520
People would be like...

33
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh you!

34
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,000
And then we all move on.

35
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,360
Senflex, thank you for the 20 gifted!

36
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,640
Welcome to Bamboo Ship!

37
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,640
Thank you!

38
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,480
And I thought that it would just be...

39
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,160
Here, hold on.

40
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,080
Oh, game.

41
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,660
Oh, game.

42
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,200
Oh, game.

43
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,180
Oh, game, oh, game.

44
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Oh, game, oh, game, oh, game.

45
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,680
Cute girl.

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,440
But, what makes... Wait, what, what, what?

47
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,080
A bit dim.

48
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,960
But that makes it cuter.

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,720
Dim?

50
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,780
The lighting?

51
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,760
Okay.

52
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,780
Okay.

53
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,780
Like in a club?

54
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,100
Wait, the jazz club?

55
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,560
Mint became JPEG dog himself.

56
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,980
That's the inspiration.

57
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,360
But, so for those who don't know what I'm talking about...

58
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,010
I wore a specific dress...

59
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,000
During my jazz karaoke...

60
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,360
Live stream...

61
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,300
And, so if you didn't watch that, you could see it there...

62
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,200
But then some people...

63
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,900
My art tag got completely overrun!

64
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,580
Completely!

65
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,200
Completely taken over!

66
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,640
And I'm very embarrassed about it.

67
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:10,760
So...

68
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,160
Hold on, let me adjust my chair.

69
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,040
I changed...

70
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
There we go.

71
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,940
I'm very embarrassed about it.

72
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,220
I can't even look at my art tag.

73
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,620
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so embarrassed.

74
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,620
My lawyer is still asking when the first child support payment is coming.

75
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,540
We got to see Minto's high D!

76
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,380
Literally everybody opening...

77
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,800
I thought people, honestly, at first I was like...

78
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,580
They might think it's the lighting, I don't think people will notice.

79
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,800
Everybody opening the stream...

80
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,420
High D!

81
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,910
Specific dress?

82
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,950
Jazz karaoke.

83
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,930
Said like Snake.

84
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,710
But um...

85
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,230
Todd!

86
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,310
Todd!

87
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,230
Thank you!

88
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:24,670
Today is 6 months since the first time you ever haunted me when you sang at AniRevo 2024!

89
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,010
Which is also coincidentally my birthday!

90
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,130
To commemorate this occasion, could you please sing me a happy half birth...

91
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,990
Half birthday?

92
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:33,830
Oh.

93
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,870
Half birthday.

94
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:38,690
Do I sing you half the song?

95
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,870
But if it's MGS style, I guess that is on...

96
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,490
That is a...

97
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:46,790
On brand, right?

98
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,790
For the...

99
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,850
For the stream today.

100
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,590
Happy birthday!

101
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,550
Congratulations!

102
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,590
Every other word!

103
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,490
Wait, let me see if I can...

104
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,130
Hold on, let me see if I can do that.

105
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,150
Hold on.

106
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,680
I have to look up the lyrics though.

107
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,820
We're doing a half birthday.

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:14,860
Okay.

109
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,760
Wait, but then I only say happy.

110
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,720
But actually that works because I don't say happy birthday.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,200
Because it's not your birthday!

112
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,060
Okay.

113
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,040
Happy...

114
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:27,900
Congratulations...

115
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,620
Happy...

116
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,340
With...

117
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,520
Happy...

118
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,680
And...

119
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,260
Your...

120
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,120
Stay...

121
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,600
Happy...

122
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,520
To...

123
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:49,980
Talk...

124
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,180
And...

125
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,250
The song...

126
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,610
We're talking about birthdays.

127
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,230
Mine was yesterday.

128
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,390
Oh no, I'm sorry!

129
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:15,290
I couldn't sing happy birthday on your actual birthday, but let's just pretend it's yesterday.

130
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,090
Except I don't want to really do yesterday again.

131
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,650
Long story short, I really don't want to get into it because it was a lot of drama.

132
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,910
My grandma wasn't doing so hot.

133
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,690
And I took her to the hospital.

134
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:30,610
My mom was out of town.

135
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,810
So I was the only one who could go.

136
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,330
I waited like four hours for an ambulance.

137
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,250
It was like a big...

138
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,690
She was back.

139
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,910
Hopefully things are okay.

140
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:47,810
Um...

141
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:52,590
But yeah, so...

142
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,630
There's a whole lot of other stuff involved.

143
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,090
But sorry that I couldn't stream Metal Gear yesterday.

144
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,830
For Lifeline, I'll just bump it to tomorrow as well.

145
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:07,910
Yeah, it was a long time.

146
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,570
I was like, oh gosh.

147
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:12,230
I won't be able to stream.

148
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,790
I feel like I could have probably streamed.

149
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,330
Because I was waiting for so long.

150
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,290
But you know, it is what it is.

151
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,810
What was it?

152
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,670
Oh, Bionic Hippo.

153
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,210
Happy birthday.

154
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,150
Congratulations.

155
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:37,290
Happy birthday with salutations.

156
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,150
Happy birthday.

157
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:41,950
May your sky stay blue.

158
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,670
Happy birthday to you.

159
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,010
Happy birthday Bionic Hippo!

160
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,410
To be fair, it was a cute dress.

161
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:53,590
But there was a bit.

162
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,110
Singing was already a treat.

163
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,370
Not sure what Wisps did to be spoiled.

164
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,610
But thanks anyway, boss.

165
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,070
You guys spoil me, I feel.

166
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:07,710
Maybe once in a while I should return the favor.

167
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,810
Maybe sometimes.

168
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:09,410
I don't know.

169
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,210
Sometimes if you're good, right?

170
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:12,950
I don't know.

171
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:17,390
Whatever.

172
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,350
Only once in a while, so you don't get big heads.

173
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,430
So you don't...

174
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,290
Okay, we'll get into the game.

175
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:36,010
Sorry, I know I'm not stalling or anything.

176
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:38,250
It's just because I didn't stream yesterday.

177
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,850
I'm all pent up of yapping energy, you know?

178
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,450
Yapping energy, you know?

179
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,550
So many birthdays!

180
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:54,550
Wait, today is the owl, isn't it?

181
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,570
Oh my gosh.

182
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,310
Happy birthday!

183
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,150
Thank you for the Haka Super!

184
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,470
Today is a special day.

185
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,690
Not only is it my 30th birthday, but there is something else more important.

186
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,330
That's right, the eagles are playing in the Super Bowl!

187
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,950
Can I get...

188
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,930
I forgot that the owl is today.

189
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,730
I don't know if I can say it.

190
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,790
Oh wait, I already said it.

191
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:17,270
I don't know.

192
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:17,870
Who is it?

193
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,410
The eagles?

194
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,430
Oh wait, my dad loved the eagles.

195
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,170
Go eagles!

196
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:24,890
Go!

197
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,570
Kaka!

198
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,770
Go birds!

199
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,970
I think that was my dad's team, the eels.

200
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,070
Wait, is that a team?

201
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,610
No, the eagles.

202
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,150
Kaka!

203
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:41,230
Kaka!

204
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,770
I'm just confused.

205
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,410
Is it the eagles or the owls?

206
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,710
Great question.

207
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,890
Because... and also there was... I have to sing happy birthdays.

208
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:55,990
I have to sing happy birthdays.

209
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,770
I haven't forgotten.

210
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,490
Kiara has her wawas, Minto has her...

211
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:00,310
No.

212
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,430
I do have toes.

213
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,710
Otherwise I wouldn't be able to stand up.

214
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:14,110
People call it the superb owl because apparently if you say Superbowl on like the radio or on TV or something, they'll find you.

215
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,630
They'll be like, that's our copyright.

216
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,810
And so they'll be like, you have to pay us money if you say Superbowl.

217
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,350
So people scoot the bee over and they say superb owl.

218
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,730
You said it twice.

219
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:33,230
This is... Good thing this is not live television.

220
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,730
Good thing this is prerecorded.

221
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,270
Okay, I have some birthdays.

222
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,450
Happy birthday!

223
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,930
Sorry, everybody will have a Metal Gear themed birthday song today.

224
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,610
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about you.

225
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,410
Happy birthday with salutations.

226
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,330
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

227
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,730
Happy birthday...

228
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,650
Happy birthday, congratulations.

229
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,610
Happy birthday with salutations.

230
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:28,370
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue.

231
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:32,850
Happy birthday to you.

232
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:38,390
Thank you for being so patient.

233
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,230
Thank you.

234
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,890
You can say it so you aren't part of the system?

235
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,530
Yeah.

236
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,110
Superbowl.

237
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:53,650
Anyway.

238
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,010
Yes.

239
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,830
Happy birthday to everybody.

240
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:01,490
Sorry if I missed your birthday yesterday when I was supposed to stream and if you were looking forward to it.

241
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,990
I'm so sorry.

242
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,490
But I'm glad I could sing it for you today.

243
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,070
We're back with Metal Gear Solid 4.

244
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,910
We're on act 3, baby.

245
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:21,990
This one is a bit silly of a mission we have going on.

246
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,170
And...

247
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:24,410
Oh!

248
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,430
I forgot to say.

249
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:29,830
Caprice no!

250
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,990
Thanks for the bangin' I got a new...

251
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:37,930
Piercing?

252
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,590
Last week.

253
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,050
That is... Wait, it's his birthday.

254
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,250
What is that?

255
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:45,870
What is that?

256
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,230
A new what?

257
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
A horse?

258
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,200
A horse?

259
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,960
I'm going to go now because...

260
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,940
A horsey?

261
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,120
A horse.

262
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,360
Happy birthday.

263
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,060
Horse?

264
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,700
Happy birthday to the horse.

265
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,620
Ink voice.

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,420
Welcome.

267
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,840
Thank you for the bread.

268
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,660
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

269
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,600
Thank you for the 20 gift cards.

270
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,560
We're right back.

271
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:37,280
Thank you for the gift cards.

272
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,420
Welcome, welcome.

273
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,200
We're just getting started with Metal Gear Solid 4.

274
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
But this is act 3 so it's kind of in the middle of it.

275
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,500
Buns of the Metal Gear Solid.

276
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,520
Buns of the Patriots.

277
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,280
Yeah.

278
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:55,420
Yeah.

279
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah.

280
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,420
Thanks for the 5 gifted.

281
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,840
Who are you rooting for in the Puppy Bowl?

282
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,280
Oh my gosh, I was just thinking about Puppy Bowl yesterday actually because...

283
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,540
I don't watch the Puppy Bowl but I know what they did last year.

284
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,380
Do you guys know what the Puppy Bowl did last year?

285
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,360
It was so messed up.

286
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,840
So basically they brought out this tiny little teacup puppy.

287
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,600
He's like 1 pound.

288
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,440
He's the smallest, cutest little puppy ever.

289
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,620
He's like the little tiniest little...

290
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,940
And they show him running around.

291
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:33,880
They're like, look how much fun this little tiny adorable little baby teacup puppy is.

292
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,620
And they made all of the American population fall in love with this little puppy.

293
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,100
And then...

294
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
And then they were like...

295
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,840
At the end of it they were like...

296
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,020
In memoriam.

297
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,520
Oh my gosh.

298
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:52,920
No!

299
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,020
That's so mean.

300
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,840
I know, right?

301
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,780
Yes, Sweet Pea.

302
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,820
Sweet Pea was the dog's name.

303
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,940
And so everyone's gonna be like, oh my gosh, Sweet Pea.

304
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,440
I fell in love, instant love with Sweet Pea.

305
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,520
But, you know, honestly...

306
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm kind of like...

307
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm very... I'm very protective of animals.

308
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
Like, I'm a person who...

309
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,640
Ever since I died, I've always adopted every animal that I've ever gotten.

310
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,640
Well, minus...

311
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,820
Well, I had a gecko.

312
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,840
I don't think you can really adopt a gecko.

313
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,420
But, you know, I was just... I was a kid, so...

314
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:47,140
But, you know, I'm also really big, you know, about dog breeding and stuff like that.

315
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,780
Because dog breeding is kind of...

316
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,960
It can be quite questionable sometimes.

317
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,680
And teacup dogs are just not bred for health.

318
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,380
They're bred for aesthetics, which is just such a sad way to go.

319
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,880
Like, sad way to live.

320
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,800
And so, you know, teacup puppies don't have...

321
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,360
They have so many...

322
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,860
So many...

323
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,360
So many health issues.

324
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,540
And so it's just really sad.

325
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,360
So...

326
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,360
So...

327
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,500
So, you know, it's so sad about Sweet Pea, but also just...

328
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,380
Oh my goodness.

329
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,420
There's so many...

330
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,020
If you sent a stream live...

331
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,560
Don't know, there's so many backed up.

332
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,980
Well, thank you, CooperFlag.

333
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,100
Thank you, Ronin.

334
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,700
Oh, I just came in.

335
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
Thank you, Ducky.

336
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,080
Thank you, Takizo.

337
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,400
In case I don't get to them later.

338
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,260
If we're, like, in the middle of a something-something.

339
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,320
Middle of a scene.

340
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,220
I was gonna say...

341
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,480
I put in some...

342
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
I put in some cheat codes.

343
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,500
I put in some cheat codes.

344
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,240
I actually...

345
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,060
I did it last week, so I don't remember which ones I put in.

346
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,640
So we will see.

347
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,080
I don't remember...

348
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,140
The passwords.

349
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,320
I put in the passwords.

350
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,480
Passwords.

351
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,940
And also...

352
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,540
I...

353
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,560
I was watching...

354
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,220
Oh my gosh.

355
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,480
Do you guys watch Big Saru?

356
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,720
If you love watching...

357
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:20,960
Thank you!

358
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,260
If you love watching people mess around in Metal Gear...

359
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,140
And just do big crazy things...

360
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,320
Big Saru is such a great...

361
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,140
He's such a great YouTube channel.

362
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,000
His videos are so funny.

363
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,040
Big Saru is a legend.

364
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,560
I love watching his stuff.

365
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,180
Oh my gosh.

366
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,380
I was watching his Metal Gear Solid 4...

367
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,020
Videos.

368
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,300
And I was like...

369
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:47,840
Oh my gosh.

370
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,240
I only need...

371
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,300
I'll be able to have the...

372
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,880
The...

373
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,720
The Sun Gun.

374
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,740
In Act 5.

375
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,380
And then I was like...

376
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,960
Wait, no.

377
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,220
I still have to beat...

378
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,020
I still have to beat Mantis.

379
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:03,800
Was...

380
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,080
I feel like there was one statue that I had.

381
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,820
But maybe not.

382
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,120
Maybe I didn't grab literally any of them.

383
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,000
Sunlight.

384
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,640
Naomi is absolutely everything you said she was.

385
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,800
Yeah, I know.

386
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,340
Hopefully today I don't crash out as hard.

387
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,560
But I do feel...

388
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,840
I do feel that maybe I have some tears to spare.

389
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,980
Because this act can get a little bit emotional.

390
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,660
I like this one a lot though.

391
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,960
Well, the beginning is kind of...

392
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,440
Whatever.

393
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,620
But I heard also that if you put on the beauty's faces...

394
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,540
Or you put on the different camo faces...

395
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,700
Other stuff will happen.

396
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,440
So we'll have to see...

397
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,160
What happens.

398
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,800
I think...

399
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,380
I really don't remember what codes I put in.

400
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
I think there was like stuff for music and...

401
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,980
But let's get into the game.

402
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,760
I've yapped...

403
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,320
I've yapped so much now.

404
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,660
I've yapped so much.

405
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,100
And also...

406
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,640
I think I'm gonna have to...

407
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,680
Farm for DP in act 5 as well.

408
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:07,940
So...

409
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,860
You know...

410
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,800
It's not ideal for this playthrough.

411
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,480
But you know, if I ever play...

412
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,600
Not if...

413
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,480
But whenever I play the game again...

414
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,280
I'll at least have, you know, the DP.

415
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,700
And I'll have the guns and stuff.

416
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,880
Because I saw how you're supposed to...

417
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,160
I looked up a video of how you're supposed to farm.

418
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,420
What I tried to do last time.

419
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,120
And oh my gosh, you guys.

420
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,040
The...

421
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,840
I think I would've been bored out of my mind.

422
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,320
It's such a...

423
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,360
It's not tedious.

424
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,620
It is a little tedious.

425
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,320
So...

426
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,980
I'm trying...

427
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,020
See if I can explain it to you guys.

428
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,640
The area that I was in...

429
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,900
Before we went to the building...

430
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:52,720
Wait.

431
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,560
Hold on.

432
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,620
There was... OK.

433
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,780
So there was a building that we went into...

434
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,660
To go underground to go see Naomi.

435
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,660
The area prior to that...

436
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Was...

437
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,840
Was the area where I needed to...

438
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,520
To farm at.

439
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:12,920
And...

440
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,880
Because the guys kept respawning, respawning, respawning.

441
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,600
And basically what I would do is...

442
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,040
I would kill a guy and leave him on the ground in a certain alleyway.

443
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,740
And then one other guy would...

444
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,100
See him in the little alleyway.

445
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,040
He would run over.

446
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,160
You grab him...

447
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,040
Or you hold him up.

448
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,200
He drops his weapon.

449
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,700
Then you grab him and you kill him.

450
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,120
And that will trigger the next guy to...

451
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,540
The guy to respawn again.

452
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:43,540
But you have to make sure you hold them up...

453
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,460
Before you do it so that they drop their weapon.

454
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,920
Or else you can't kill them or you won't get the weapon.

455
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,040
It would have been so long.

456
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,560
It's a very slow loop.

457
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,380
It's a very slow loop.

458
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:57,680
Yeah.

459
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,480
So I think I would have been so...

460
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,480
I would have been so bored.

461
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,080
And so...

462
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,500
The other way to farm is just killing a bunch of the little dwarfs.

463
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,620
In Act 5.

464
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,820
And I have something for that.

465
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,800
Oh, I remember!

466
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,060
One of the guns I got.

467
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
With the password.

468
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,020
So...

469
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,340
Yeah.

470
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,340
So you're telling me it is Naomi's fault.

471
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,400
Absolutely.

472
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,220
Of course.

473
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,660
100%.

474
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,200
Anyway.

475
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:29,860
Act 3.

476
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,020
Briefing end.

477
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,020
We watch the briefing.

478
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,480
Time to get into the meat of it.

479
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,540
God.

480
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,380
Already ruining my day.

481
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,040
I have to see her stinking face.

482
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,880
As soon as we load up...

483
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,800
I can't, but...

484
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,320
Just look at the right side of the thumbnail.

485
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,820
I would kill a guy and leave him in an alleyway.

486
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,140
Oh, that explains the ghost in the ending screen.

487
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,380
Okay.

488
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,660
Here we go.

489
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:12,700
I will never and have never endorsed a Naomi and Otacon ship.

490
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,820
You're among friends here.

491
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,340
Why...

492
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,830
Why...

493
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,520
You're making...

494
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,160
Bleh, Naomi!

495
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,480
Act 4 has a secret way of getting 1000 AP instantly?

496
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,620
No way.

497
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,060
Really?

498
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,580
That didn't show up when I looked up how to farm.

499
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,140
Oh my gosh.

500
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,440
Europe.

501
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Wow.

502
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,840
Europe.

503
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,060
So European.

504
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,220
Europe dies.

505
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,640
Pizza!

506
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,040
Resistance.

507
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,420
Oh, that's right.

508
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,360
We have to fight Raging Raven today.

509
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,160
It says I used to be an anime otaku.

510
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,820
Who is that?

511
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,860
Who is that?

512
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,640
Big Boss' corpse.

513
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,460
The framerate.

514
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,380
I'm the only one who thinks Naomi's character.

515
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,960
But guys, I know I get very heated about Naomi, but...

516
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,420
I wanna only talk about her the entire stream, okay?

517
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,180
She ain't here right now, so...

518
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,760
Let's, you know...

519
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,180
I know everybody's got their thoughts and everybody knows my thoughts as well, so...

520
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,980
I think so.

521
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,180
Oh yeah.

522
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,640
Oh yeah.

523
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Oh yeah.

524
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,240
You checked him down.

525
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,440
We patted that guy down real good.

526
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,900
Next.

527
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,040
Next.

528
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,940
Oh, they're gonna see!

529
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,380
They're gonna see Columbo.

530
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,760
Those uniforms look so heavy.

531
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:17,960
Next.

532
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,400
Like, they look a little, like...

533
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:20,920
Set.

534
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,460
Next.

535
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,540
Oh, sorry.

536
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,920
I don't speak English.

537
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:25,620
I'm in Europe.

538
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,140
Get your ass in the machine.

539
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:27,880
No!

540
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,700
Ghost in the machine!

541
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,400
Take him away.

542
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,540
Why is he like this?

543
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,500
Why are you like this?

544
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,940
Why did you even get in line?

545
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,980
So stupid.

546
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,130
No smoking.

547
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,150
I'll take him from here.

548
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,610
We've been looking for this man.

549
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,460
Who could that be?

550
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,920
They're being so secretive about everyone.

551
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,540
Come with me.

552
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,520
I'd recognize those cheeks anywhere.

553
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,600
So true.

554
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,400
No!

555
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,160
No making!

556
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,500
What?

557
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,040
Oh my gosh, wait.

558
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:57,900
It's the famous GIF.

559
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,220
Thank you for the famous GIF!

560
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,420
It's the GIF!

561
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,300
Everybody who hit 30 today.

562
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,940
The man.

563
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,860
Snake!

564
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Hey Snake!

565
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:21,900
Over here!

566
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,300
Hey Snake!

567
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,960
He's so embarrassing.

568
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:38,160
I love him so much though.

569
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,140
Oh Johnny, they could never make me hate you.

570
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,560
No smoking.

571
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,900
Yeah!

572
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,520
Meryl's so cool.

573
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,620
Snake?

574
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,240
Snake looks like an alien without his bandana on.

575
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,180
I can't recognize him as a person.

576
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,320
He's a perpetual...

577
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,280
His poor forehead.

578
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,700
Meryl, listen to him.

579
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,340
It's a hired hit.

580
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,450
How is he smoking while wearing face camo?

581
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,370
Great question.

582
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:48,870
It's like people that wear zentai suits.

583
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,010
And they like...

584
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,010
Shove food through the mask.

585
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,030
Probably the same.

586
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,670
Oh Snake.

587
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,510
It's so pathetic!

588
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,810
What's wrong Nano?

589
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:17,730
You don't want a song?

590
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,970
You don't want a birthday song?

591
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:24,230
No, Snake.

592
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,980
Thank you, Abe King.

593
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:00,610
But now you're just too damn senile to face the truth.

594
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:05,830
Wake up and face reality.

595
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,530
Old Snake.

596
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,570
And stay out of our way.

597
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,520
She didn't have to do that!

598
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,040
She didn't have to be like that!

599
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,960
Oh my gosh, I just saw the orange, orange sign.

600
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:25,500
Cute.

601
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,200
It hurts.

602
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,500
Everybody just bullies Snake in this game.

603
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,220
It's so painful.

604
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,500
I've been watching the show Severance.

605
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,080
And the last episode was like so crazy.

606
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,360
And I just want to be like, Meryl was never cruel!

607
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,900
Is it him?

608
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,460
I don't know who you're talking about.

609
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,850
Oh boy, here we go.

610
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:24,950
Aw man.

611
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,930
Hairy?

612
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:41,730
Thanks, Nova!

613
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,170
Resistance.

614
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,790
Big Mama.

615
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:08,510
I like that name coming out of Otacon's mouth.

616
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,850
Open the item window and select the signal interceptor.

617
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:44,030
The interceptor constantly monitors PMC voice and data transmissions.

618
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:50,790
When you've got the signal interceptor equipped and you hear the PMC's chatter about the resistance, check your map.

619
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,190
It should display the location.

620
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,910
Oh, and Snake, I think we've found a way to treat Raiden.

621
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,390
I'll sing Happy Birthday after the cutscene.

622
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,730
Yeah, we got in touch with Dr. Madnar.

623
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,810
Naomi and Sunny are on their way now.

624
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,310
They'll be alright on their own.

625
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,030
They're a few clicks north of where you are now.

626
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,990
It's a non-combat zone, so there won't be any checkpoints.

627
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:11,370
Nice.

628
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,250
There's even a dialysis machine.

629
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,610
It'll take some time, but I think he'll be okay.

630
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,610
Raiden!

631
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:22,670
Anyway, you need to hurry and make contact with Big Mama.

632
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:23,570
I got it.

633
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,570
Why did he do that hand thing with his hand?

634
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,430
With the Big Mama!

635
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:30,790
Go!

636
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,570
Go find the Big Mama!

637
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:36,570
X-Ray!

638
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:54,710
Happy Birthday!

639
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,170
Thank you for the superchats, you guys.

640
00:37:59,250 --> 00:37:59,770
Thank you.

641
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,650
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

642
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,730
Hold on, I have an itch.

643
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,110
Okay, let's go.

644
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:18,530
Searching.

645
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:18,970
Searching.

646
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,330
I went somewhere.

647
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:26,870
Snatcher!

648
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:31,990
Yes.

649
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:34,250
I want to play Snatcher so badly.

650
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,550
Oh, this guy is looking suspicious.

651
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,750
Mighty, mighty suspicious here.

652
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,610
Hello, civilians.

653
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:49,410
Okay, wait.

654
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:50,670
I do...

655
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,090
Oh, he's doing his little whistling.

656
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:54,090
Okay, I do want to just...

657
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,930
Let's be...

658
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,350
See, I can be Campbell.

659
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,610
Maybe we shouldn't be any of the people though.

660
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,950
But, you know, maybe we should be a hot lady.

661
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,590
Let's be...

662
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,550
Okay, we won't be any of the ones that you guys haven't seen yet, so...

663
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,230
This is so disturbing.

664
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,670
Let's...

665
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:33,550
Oh yeah, I got this too!

666
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,510
Actually, this kind of fits for...

667
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,050
Does this not fit for Europe?

668
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,390
Does this not work?

669
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,670
Hmm...

670
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,570
That guy.

671
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,110
Oh, Dr. Madnar.

672
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,130
Not suspicious at all.

673
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:13,050
Maybe we should be hot... Oh, nope.

674
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,910
I mean, we are still hot.

675
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,130
Anybody is hot in a suit.

676
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:17,810
Chest.

677
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,070
Hot dog, indeed.

678
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,250
We're just a hot lady in a suit.

679
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,790
We're a hot lady in a suit.

680
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:33,370
It's 1225 in California.

681
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,830
I'm sending this donation.

682
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:37,110
What, so 20 minutes later?

683
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,310
Uh-oh.

684
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,110
Sorry, they're kind of behind.

685
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,210
They should have added a liquid ocelot, Campbell.

686
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:45,130
That would be breaking the game.

687
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:48,850
The sign is very human.

688
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,370
Ronin, thank you.

689
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,470
Oh my goodness.

690
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,710
We just have to hide ourselves from this guy.

691
00:41:08,490 --> 00:41:11,470
But we also have to like...

692
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,090
trail him.

693
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,550
And we have to make sure he also doesn't get into any trouble.

694
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,130
Don't look back.

695
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,410
Don't look back.

696
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,890
Delta hype!

697
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,170
I know!

698
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:28,870
Delta hype real.

699
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,850
Oh my gosh.

700
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,690
I'm so excited.

701
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,670
Thank you, laptop.

702
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:34,550
What is

703
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:53,230
that horrible sound?

704
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,570
Oh, you dropped something.

705
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,920
There is so much noise.

706
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,090
Launching this year.

707
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,990
I will be playing...

708
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,170
Day 1?

709
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:15,630
I'll probably endurance it.

710
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,310
Honestly.

711
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:18,810
I'm so excited.

712
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,500
Wait, is this where I have to start protecting him?

713
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,360
Or... I can't remember.

714
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,800
Is this where I have to start knocking the guys out?

715
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:46,940
He's asleep.

716
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:00,810
He's asleep.

717
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:02,430
Keep walking.

718
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:12,630
Why are you whistling so loudly if you don't want people to notice you?

719
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:15,010
That's all I have to say.

720
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,310
That's all I wonder, you know?

721
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:22,670
Good night.

722
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,330
Oh, he sees me.

723
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,150
No, he doesn't.

724
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,510
Stop whistling if you don't want anybody to notice you.

725
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,100
Most suspicious person in all of Europe.

726
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,780
What if I went a different way?

727
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,780
I'm so curious.

728
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,640
What if I go up here?

729
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:01,660
What do you mean report of intruder?

730
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,000
I'm not an intruder.

731
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,660
I'm just...

732
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:09,680
Oh my god!

733
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,020
Scared the hell out of me.

734
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,020
Don't see me?

735
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,640
Oh my gosh!

736
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,940
Hello sir, going the most roundabout way ever.

737
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,340
I got you.

738
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,000
I got your help.

739
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,440
I'm helping you.

740
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,060
Wait, where did he go?

741
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,300
Oh my god!

742
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,280
He's shivering.

743
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,660
Must be cold.

744
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,620
Why is everybody peeing in this game?

745
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:20,910
Oh my god, the park stinks.

746
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:26,970
Which way is he going?

747
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:30,190
That works.

748
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:31,890
That works.

749
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:36,370
They're asleep.

750
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:36,930
You can go.

751
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:38,790
I'm so curious.

752
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,130
What do they do if they see me?

753
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,150
I don't want to start over though.

754
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:49,090
I'm too afraid to start over.

755
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,870
Oh my god, where are you going?

756
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,110
Just walk on by.

757
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,770
I won't need to restart.

758
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:00,290
Are they going to fall in love with me?

759
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,550
Can I have your stuff?

760
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:04,570
You got any?

761
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:15,730
Where did he go?

762
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:16,870
Oh there he is.

763
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,810
My map?

764
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,810
Where is the solid item?

765
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:27,890
Where is it?

766
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,650
I think we got our guy.

767
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:41,310
Where is the love dart?

768
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:41,890
True!

769
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,570
Oh I lost him.

770
00:46:44,590 --> 00:46:44,910
Sir?

771
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,790
Sir?

772
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:49,010
Sir?

773
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:50,630
Oh there he is.

774
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:53,850
I wish I could knock him out.

775
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:03,710
The camera is not so hot right now.

776
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,850
Who's around here?

777
00:47:16,430 --> 00:47:16,970
There he goes.

778
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:20,670
Thank you!

779
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,850
Ok Otacon, I get it.

780
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:27,190
I think...

781
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,470
I'm gonna...

782
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,270
I think I don't need to listen anymore.

783
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,430
Don't see me!

784
00:47:49,210 --> 00:47:50,310
That's you!

785
00:47:50,730 --> 00:47:51,590
My resistance!

786
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:55,130
Oh come on snake, chill out.

787
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,570
Act hot.

788
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,780
I wanna see some guys.

789
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,320
Don't see me.

790
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,600
Don't see me.

791
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,740
I'm up his stick.

792
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,240
I'm behind the pole.

793
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,540
Wait, did he see me?

794
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,140
Don't run.

795
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:28,360
Don't run.

796
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:29,160
We're chill.

797
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:29,560
We're chill.

798
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:29,980
We're chill.

799
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,240
We're chill.

800
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:32,640
We're chill.

801
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,620
We're chill.

802
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,260
Oh my god, I just heard somebody.

803
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:42,620
Where are you going?

804
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,480
Oh my god.

805
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,300
Here we go!

806
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,600
We gotta follow.

807
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,240
I was gonna check out the other area.

808
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,320
I probably should have done it.

809
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:04,960
Oopsie!

810
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:06,660
Oh well.

811
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:08,320
Alright.

812
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,520
Wow, you're up.

813
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,860
Wow.

814
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:18,540
Bird.

815
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:19,160
Where did he go?

816
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:20,340
Hello?

817
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,480
Resistance?

818
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:25,860
Where?

819
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:31,420
What is this?

820
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,660
Sorry.

821
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,080
Oh my god.

822
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,380
Sir, you need to wear a bell or something.

823
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,620
Good lord.

824
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,700
Thank you so much for the pink.

825
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:59,100
That's actually my true reaction when I have to go outside and I see another person.

826
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:01,800
Look at that!

827
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,260
Year of the snake!

828
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,320
Smooth operator.

829
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:12,460
Yeah!

830
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:16,480
Snake!

831
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,170
Oh boy!

832
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,530
Oh golly!

833
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,550
Ok, I'm gonna go up to these guys and see what happens.

834
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:29,910
Do you think they're gonna like me?

835
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,400
Ok Otacon, thank you.

836
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:44,950
Last year?

837
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:45,950
Year of the snake?

838
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:46,890
No, it's this year.

839
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,390
I'm under...

840
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,590
Boss, get down.

841
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,350
That's an enemy gunship.

842
00:50:57,450 --> 00:50:57,710
Hello?

843
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:08,310
I don't think they cared about my disguise.

844
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,400
No girls allowed!

845
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,300
No!

846
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,220
What?

847
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,340
But I'm hot!

848
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,420
Evasion was so easy.

849
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:30,960
No way.

850
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,780
No way that actually... I just got away with it.

851
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,280
Hot people privilege?

852
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,040
No, no.

853
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:44,780
I'm trying!

854
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:47,540
Oh, wait.

855
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,420
Not auto-aim.

856
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,640
Oh my gosh!

857
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,100
He's gone!

858
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,380
Oh my gosh.

859
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,860
Wait, I need to change my ammo.

860
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,580
I have nothing left.

861
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,780
Ok, we need to buy more ammo.

862
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,000
He got caught!

863
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,740
Hot people privilege, real.

864
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,800
Couldn't beat me!

865
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,940
Maybe we get an emotional map.

866
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:11,780
Wow!

867
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,860
The Beauty and the Beast magazine!

868
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,220
It's the hottest stories.

869
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:20,340
I mean, these are also the hottest stories.

870
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,220
I'm just gonna get the regular...

871
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,160
Let's save money, you know.

872
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,920
Wait, I'm playing on Sunday.

873
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,180
Does that mean things are on sale?

874
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,500
It didn't give me a message.

875
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:44,180
I wonder if because I unplugged my PS2 if the clock is out of whack.

876
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:47,800
I think.

877
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:57,570
Ah man, isn't the sale on Wednesday?

878
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,550
It's Wednesday and Sunday actually.

879
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:02,670
Why?

880
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:03,510
Let's just buy.

881
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,110
Oh yeah, check the big purchases.

882
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,570
The things that we're trying to get.

883
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,290
So true.

884
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,210
Oh no, it is on sale!

885
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:13,310
Look at that!

886
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:16,390
Because it's usually 5 million, but now it's 4 million.

887
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:20,630
Yeah, so it is on sale.

888
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:25,850
I think I do that impression a little too well.

889
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,530
Did

890
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,460
I see somebody else?

891
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:43,580
No.

892
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,100
Take out this guy.

893
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,060
There we go.

894
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,940
Take him out.

895
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,560
Caution goes down.

896
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,100
Return to Minky.

897
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,620
Hold it.

898
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,260
Oh, he's all the way over there?

899
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:13,820
How did he get over there?

900
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:23,990
Can I get your stuff?

901
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:24,330
Thank you.

902
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:30,890
I'm working on it.

903
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:32,490
Oh, I'm full.

904
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,740
Maybe he shouldn't be part of the resistance if he doesn't know how to take care of himself.

905
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:42,760
I'm just saying.

906
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:46,120
You're free.

907
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:47,880
You're free to go.

908
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,650
He's so...

909
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:56,010
Maybe...

910
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:59,450
Oh my gosh.

911
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:00,970
I didn't notice that guy.

912
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:01,870
We're fine.

913
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,910
Everything is cool.

914
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,390
We're chill.

915
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:04,810
Cucumber style.

916
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,940
I'm even going to take out that guy.

917
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,580
I don't know which way...

918
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,520
What are you doing?

919
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:17,620
He's running around like a chicken with his head cut off.

920
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:20,300
Are you going this way?

921
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,140
Are you going that way?

922
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,060
Which way are we going?

923
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:22,680
Huh, buddy?

924
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,680
Bro can't believe his luck.

925
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:30,740
If I were him, I would think I stink.

926
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,900
I would be quite concerned actually.

927
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,900
I would be like, do I smell bad or...

928
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,040
Why is everybody around me fainting?

929
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,940
I would be nervous.

930
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:41,960
Where is he?

931
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,200
Where did he go?

932
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,660
Wait, we lost the target.

933
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:55,440
We lost the target.

934
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,020
Where did he go?

935
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,040
Stinky!

936
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,020
Where are you?

937
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:09,060
Stinky!

938
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,580
Stinky!

939
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,200
Stinky!

940
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,920
Stinky...

941
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,540
Where is he?

942
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,720
I don't think my disguise worked either guys.

943
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,880
I think I might want to actually change into another normal outfit.

944
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:45,940
Camouflage.

945
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:52,940
God, she's...

946
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:54,520
She's an absolute unit.

947
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,240
Oh my gosh, that's one thing that I noticed about Delta.

948
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:00,520
If you haven't seen it yet...

949
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,520
They...

950
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,140
Oh wow, look how cute!

951
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,880
Wow, they turned Snake into like...

952
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,400
He is humongous.

953
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,080
Your gun was out.

954
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,860
Oh, do you think that's why they attacked me?

955
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,580
We can try again.

956
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:20,260
Oh wait, I changed to my suit.

957
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,340
He is just like...

958
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,320
Really...

959
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:32,000
He looks like a brick wall.

960
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,460
He is like really huge.

961
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,620
Oh my gosh, rats.

962
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:40,800
Is that you?

963
00:57:43,100 --> 00:57:43,960
Is that him?

964
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,480
What are you waiting on?

965
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,840
What do you see?

966
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,200
I don't see anything.

967
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,120
What are you waiting for?

968
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,040
He's gone.

969
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,140
He's like a ghost.

970
00:57:58,660 --> 00:57:59,120
Scary.

971
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:02,650
He left.

972
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:03,930
He left a snack.

973
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:05,510
Nevermind.

974
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:06,910
Is he going this way?

975
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:08,470
Hello?

976
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,810
Floor noodles.

977
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:15,510
This must be a European specialty.

978
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,150
Hello?

979
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,350
Did he go this way?

980
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:20,670
I guess we'll check.

981
00:58:24,290 --> 00:58:25,830
Masashi cam, welcome to membership.

982
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:26,950
Thank you!

983
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,980
Do we go the right way?

984
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:34,780
Where is the suit?

985
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,640
I don't see him.

986
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,580
Oh shoot.

987
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,820
Oh wait, let's go check.

988
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:42,700
Let's check.

989
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,640
Hello?

990
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,360
I don't think they like my outfit guys.

991
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,840
I don't think they like my outfit.

992
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:52,860
What do you have against women in suits?

993
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:05,300
We're still in trouble.

994
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:06,340
We're still in trouble.

995
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,200
They would hate Helltaker.

996
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,880
Get your ass!

997
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,980
I'm so dead.

998
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,400
I'm so dead.

999
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:22,640
I'm so dead.

1000
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:24,740
Wait!

1001
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,180
Shoot!

1002
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,510
I got him.

1003
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:35,610
Oh my gosh!

1004
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:40,210
They keep coming.

1005
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,710
I'm just going to keep taking your money.

1006
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:47,270
Where are you?

1007
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,090
Where are you going?

1008
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,600
Oh my gosh!

1009
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,700
I see a guy over there!

1010
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,040
Oh here he comes.

1011
01:00:04,740 --> 01:00:05,400
Oh shoot.

1012
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:07,640
I got him.

1013
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,340
Oh man, another one?

1014
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,960
I'm not telling him to get up.

1015
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,160
I'm telling him to take his stuff.

1016
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,000
I got spotted by somebody.

1017
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,740
The alert went back up.

1018
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:31,600
Wait, who?

1019
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,080
Who saw me?

1020
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:33,220
What do you mean?

1021
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,620
It's so bright.

1022
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:46,560
Did you see me?

1023
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:49,540
No.

1024
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,020
Look at my stupid dummy helicopter.

1025
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,880
We're fine.

1026
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:10,700
Everything is good.

1027
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,340
My snake?

1028
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,080
Ok, let's check.

1029
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:12,980
For real.

1030
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:15,900
I thought that maybe it's a suit.

1031
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,120
Maybe I have to be in my disguise.

1032
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,020
I don't know.

1033
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:24,780
Whatever.

1034
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,060
I tried.

1035
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:29,700
I tried.

1036
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,140
For the mask you need to have no weapons equipped, including the knife.

1037
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,560
Try the camo, since otherwise I know your size.

1038
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:38,000
Vaccinating to ignore if annoying.

1039
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,580
No, no, no.

1040
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:41,120
I thought I unequipped my weapon.

1041
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:41,620
Did I not?

1042
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,520
Oh, my knife was out.

1043
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:46,340
I thought I had unequipped it.

1044
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:48,300
We'll try one more time.

1045
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:52,900
We'll try one more time.

1046
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,120
Dang it, I think it auto equipped the knife.

1047
01:01:58,620 --> 01:01:59,780
Ok, now we're chill.

1048
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:06,320
We're chill.

1049
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:06,680
We're chill.

1050
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,580
We're chill.

1051
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,040
No, we're chill.

1052
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:10,520
We're chill.

1053
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,760
This time for sure.

1054
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:15,820
It looks weird.

1055
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:23,000
I mean, snake wearing this disguise looks incredibly weird, so...

1056
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:29,590
I wonder...

1057
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:34,010
This looks so in character.

1058
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,330
For the location.

1059
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,250
They'll never find me.

1060
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:45,230
The best game of prop hunt ever.

1061
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:49,470
Yeah, we're so normal.

1062
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,970
Sorry, we'll just wait for 30 seconds.

1063
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,170
Is this your first time through 4?

1064
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,730
No, but it is only my second time playing it.

1065
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:02,190
Try equipping the signal interceptor.

1066
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:06,170
You should be able to get intel on the resistance from PMC communications.

1067
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:08,270
I'm not a pro at the game.

1068
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:10,810
I just like the story a lot.

1069
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,110
Oh no, he's waking him up.

1070
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,910
Oh no!

1071
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:20,790
Oh no!

1072
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:23,650
Wait!

1073
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:24,670
Don't do that!

1074
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:27,730
Sorry, I'm trying to get it so you guys can see, but...

1075
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:31,970
The chat is blocking it a little bit.

1076
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,610
Do you think I can go out now?

1077
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:44,020
Hello, fellow soldier.

1078
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,360
I give up.

1079
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,790
What do you mean the knife?

1080
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:21,490
Guys, it's not equipped.

1081
01:04:22,030 --> 01:04:23,230
I can show you.

1082
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,790
It's not equipped.

1083
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:25,030
See?

1084
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,010
I had it like this.

1085
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,350
He just has it in his hand!

1086
01:04:32,570 --> 01:04:33,050
Ouch!

1087
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:33,990
Stop!

1088
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,310
The problem is the mask.

1089
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:47,430
What's wrong with my mask?

1090
01:04:49,330 --> 01:04:50,650
They don't like this beauty?

1091
01:04:51,110 --> 01:04:52,970
OK, spoilers for Raging Raven.

1092
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,470
You guys know they are all hot.

1093
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:54,830
Whatever.

1094
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:57,590
I gotta move too.

1095
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,390
I gotta move back.

1096
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:04,610
Life was still out, but I didn't...Oh my gosh!

1097
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:05,990
I think it comes out.

1098
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,610
It's not me taking it out though.

1099
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:10,590
I'm gonna die.

1100
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:12,850
I think I might just die here.

1101
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:14,750
And just restart.

1102
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:31,890
It's OK.

1103
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:32,870
I died on purpose there.

1104
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:39,850
Where am I?

1105
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:49,180
I'm actually not sure of where I am.

1106
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:51,500
Oh,

1107
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,060
I'm on this side.

1108
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,280
OK, I'm where I just died.

1109
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1110
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,540
OK, I'm in the same place.

1111
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,760
OK, that's not so bad.

1112
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,520
OK, alright.

1113
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,780
We have the knife in the hand, but how do I get it out of the hand?

1114
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,820
I did not have it.

1115
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,420
How do I have it?

1116
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,060
Maybe because my hands are in my pocket?

1117
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,500
Take the knife out of your weapons list.

1118
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:25,480
OK, let's try that.

1119
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:26,560
That's a good idea actually.

1120
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:29,920
OK, let's just change it to...

1121
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,680
Oh wait, I know what I wanna change it to.

1122
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,120
I know what I wanna change it to.

1123
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:37,860
I will show you.

1124
01:06:38,180 --> 01:06:39,140
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1125
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,060
This is so awesome when you use this weapon.

1126
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:45,800
The Patriot!

1127
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,020
We have the Patriot.

1128
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,880
Oh my gosh, it does something special when you use it.

1129
01:06:57,140 --> 01:06:59,100
But also, do you notice something special too?

1130
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:01,100
Do you notice something?

1131
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,220
It has infinite ammo!

1132
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,160
Yeah baby!

1133
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:13,400
Try walking only.

1134
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,220
Oh yeah, because my...OK.

1135
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:16,500
Walk only.

1136
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:17,900
Alright.

1137
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:19,600
I'm a hot lady.

1138
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,000
I'm a hot...Oh wait, did you see that though?

1139
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,620
The knife is not in my weapons anymore, but I'm still holding it.

1140
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,180
OK, let's walk.

1141
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,780
Walk, walk, walk.

1142
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,300
What do I change it to?

1143
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:32,820
The face?

1144
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:41,620
They've seen the face.

1145
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:42,660
Are they that smart?

1146
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:45,600
Are they that smart?

1147
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:49,180
OK, we're gonna go to...Campbell.

1148
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:22,930
Warning, there is a baddie on the loose.

1149
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,890
Oh my gosh.

1150
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:26,910
Oh my gosh!

1151
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,150
He looks incredible.

1152
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:31,970
Otacon.

1153
01:08:32,590 --> 01:08:34,290
Get this man a peacoat!

1154
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,470
Oh my gosh, he looks so good.

1155
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:40,650
Ew!

1156
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,130
Brush your teeth Raiden.

1157
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:46,750
What the hell is that?

1158
01:08:50,570 --> 01:08:52,710
He looks like a mouth breather.

1159
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,750
OK, sorry for spoilers.

1160
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:58,690
You know that all the beauties are hot.

1161
01:08:59,290 --> 01:09:00,470
Alright, I'm a hot beauty.

1162
01:09:02,490 --> 01:09:05,050
He's hot, but also he's Inspector Gadget.

1163
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,890
If I fail this again...

1164
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:10,810
I'm gonna...

1165
01:09:10,810 --> 01:09:11,750
Where

1166
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:25,150
is our guy?

1167
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,230
Where is he?

1168
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:31,510
It worked!

1169
01:09:31,650 --> 01:09:33,910
Oh my gosh, we finally got it to work!

1170
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:38,510
Oh my god, we finally...but where is our guy?

1171
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:42,470
Is he all the way back at the front?

1172
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,010
Did he leave?

1173
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:46,710
Mister!

1174
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:46,910
Mister!

1175
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:51,440
Mister!

1176
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:55,840
Mister!

1177
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:59,960
I think walking is the key, because when I run...

1178
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,460
You can see the knife come out, but if I walk it's hidden.

1179
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:05,740
Oh, the signal interceptor.

1180
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:06,380
Yeah, thank you.

1181
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,200
Mister!

1182
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,680
Mister, searching, searching.

1183
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:13,680
Searching for...

1184
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,880
For a guy.

1185
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,780
If you're a man, put your hands up!

1186
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,220
What's that behind them?

1187
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:26,240
What is that?

1188
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,160
Hello.

1189
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:30,140
Hello.

1190
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:31,960
Hello.

1191
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:34,680
Yeah, you had a hard day, huh?

1192
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:36,120
Oh, it's just a barrel.

1193
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:36,500
OK.

1194
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,260
Where is he?

1195
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,060
I have.

1196
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:47,120
What?

1197
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,880
Forget about him?

1198
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:55,380
What do you mean forget about him?

1199
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,180
I was attached to him!

1200
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,880
Forget about him?

1201
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,960
That's so horrible!

1202
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:05,860
How am I supposed to tell who is a resistance member?

1203
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,360
Everybody has the same thing on...

1204
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:11,700
Say a stinko.

1205
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,960
Oh man.

1206
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,360
Say a resistance.

1207
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,480
Oh, Europe is huge.

1208
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:36,020
I was so attached to that guy.

1209
01:11:44,110 --> 01:11:46,830
Do I still get recognized if I'm in the spotlight?

1210
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:57,510
Guess not.

1211
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:00,030
Pretty privilege!

1212
01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:01,670
Privilege!

1213
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:03,950
Pretty privilege!

1214
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:10,250
I don't see on the map.

1215
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,710
Otacon, am I blind?

1216
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:14,730
Otacon, I think my map is not working.

1217
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:18,250
Otacon, I'm blind.

1218
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,690
I like hearing the people inside the buildings.

1219
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:23,450
It's kind of fun.

1220
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:25,730
I think he's over here.

1221
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:26,630
Oh my god!

1222
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:28,710
I found him.

1223
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:32,950
Oh!

1224
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,610
Oh my god!

1225
01:12:39,310 --> 01:12:40,350
He's in love with me!

1226
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,110
Oh my god, he's checking me out!

1227
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,450
See you later.

1228
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,150
It's me, your girlfriend.

1229
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,210
Sir, don't forget the mission!

1230
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:56,130
Oh my god, he's blinded by love.

1231
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:58,830
Pretty privilege.

1232
01:12:59,010 --> 01:13:01,230
Is this what it means to be hot?

1233
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:05,130
People on the street just fall in love with you and...

1234
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:06,030
What?

1235
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:08,710
I can't believe this is happening to me!

1236
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:18,470
He's running.

1237
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:20,310
I'm following.

1238
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:25,490
Does he need me to knock the people out?

1239
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:27,110
I feel like he should, you know...

1240
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,150
No, he's gone.

1241
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:30,390
Okay.

1242
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:37,480
I'm going too.

1243
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,260
Act like you are new to this.

1244
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:46,020
Guys, I'm dead.

1245
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:49,880
People, like 90% of the population can't even see me.

1246
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,440
What are you talking about?

1247
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,280
Not a lot of people have a sixth sense, okay?

1248
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,320
Acting like I, you know...

1249
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:06,280
What is this?

1250
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,200
Maybe he can get behind them.

1251
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:10,760
I can too.

1252
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,200
Don't knock that over.

1253
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,800
Don't knock that over!

1254
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,920
Oh my god, my guys.

1255
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,840
Of course, an idiot.

1256
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:23,520
Only an idiot would fall in love with me.

1257
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:26,960
There you go, you're welcome.

1258
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,400
Of course, it had to be this dummy-dumb.

1259
01:14:34,680 --> 01:14:35,300
You're good.

1260
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:36,640
Wait, where are you running to?

1261
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,160
I knew... As soon as I saw that can, I knew it was going to be bad news bears.

1262
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,590
Where did he go?

1263
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:51,330
Hello?

1264
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:56,720
Nothing?

1265
01:14:57,620 --> 01:14:58,560
What the hell?

1266
01:14:58,960 --> 01:14:59,700
Excuse me?

1267
01:15:00,660 --> 01:15:01,440
What are you doing?

1268
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:02,380
I'm your girlfriend!

1269
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,400
Now, I'm a drum can.

1270
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,420
He saw the knife.

1271
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:13,180
I thought

1272
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:17,500
I...

1273
01:15:17,500 --> 01:15:19,300
This part is so stupid.

1274
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,500
I feel like I should just...

1275
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:24,520
I feel like it would just be easier to do it the way I was before.

1276
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:28,360
Where did he go?

1277
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:29,300
Sir?

1278
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,100
You don't hate me anymore, do you?

1279
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:35,340
Oh gosh, these are so tricky to find.

1280
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,600
You were in love with me!

1281
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:47,400
Oh, there he is.

1282
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:47,640
Okay.

1283
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,480
Knock him out.

1284
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,540
That's how I feel too.

1285
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,420
Yeah, we should just knock him out.

1286
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,320
Alright.

1287
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,040
Where are you going?

1288
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,540
You know you could have taken the stairs, but instead...

1289
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:09,380
Instead, you take that way.

1290
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:20,920
Yeah, this part is a little, you know... It's a little weak.

1291
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,780
But it's not my least favorite.

1292
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,460
If I crouch, I can't tell if crouching...

1293
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:27,590
What crouch-walk works too, but...

1294
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:29,320
You know.

1295
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:30,940
We're following him.

1296
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:31,460
It's fine.

1297
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:33,980
We're good.

1298
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:36,720
Had a gun this whole time too.

1299
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:38,020
Son of a bitch.

1300
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:42,200
He could have been doing all his own stunts.

1301
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,480
Instead, I'm the one helping him out.

1302
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,080
Hello, resistance.

1303
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,720
Don't mind me.

1304
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,100
I'm just a hot lady trailing you.

1305
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:03,940
You have to hide the knife and the cake.

1306
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,660
I don't think we want to hide the cake.

1307
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:09,500
I think this guy wants to see every bit of the cake.

1308
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,200
Doesn't he?

1309
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:10,880
You don't think so?

1310
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,800
You don't think this guy wants to see every last cake?

1311
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:16,480
Every last frosting?

1312
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,320
The jam inside?

1313
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,460
Alright.

1314
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:25,840
We're walking still.

1315
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,760
What did I just hear?

1316
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,160
Oh my God.

1317
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,440
What the hell?

1318
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:43,350
You're supposed to be...we're on the same side.

1319
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:47,850
I think I just got mugged.

1320
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:54,340
Oh wait.

1321
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,860
He's coming back up.

1322
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:14,240
First time ever in Europe.

1323
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:15,180
This sucks.

1324
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:16,880
Oh, I have full ration.

1325
01:18:17,020 --> 01:18:17,320
That's right.

1326
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:21,840
Where did he get the outfit from anyway?

1327
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,280
I don't see any guys here.

1328
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:27,440
Where did he get it from?

1329
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:29,100
Press.

1330
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:29,700
That's nice.

1331
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:36,300
I'm going to change my face.

1332
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:36,840
Sorry.

1333
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,260
I don't want him to...

1334
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:39,840
Oh wait.

1335
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:41,040
Beauty.

1336
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:43,720
We're this beauty.

1337
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:51,150
Where did he go?

1338
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,370
Oh shoot.

1339
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,390
I lost him again.

1340
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:03,650
Oh good.

1341
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:05,630
We need more ammo.

1342
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:11,250
I'm being super slow, super careful.

1343
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:14,890
I think that's a bird.

1344
01:19:15,910 --> 01:19:16,770
We're going this way.

1345
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:17,890
I think he went this way.

1346
01:19:19,430 --> 01:19:19,830
Oh.

1347
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:23,250
Is that our...

1348
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:27,470
It's me!

1349
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:31,210
Just a hot lady.

1350
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:36,830
Just a hot lady trailing a guy.

1351
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:38,590
Yeah, we're staying cool.

1352
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:40,630
We're staying cool.

1353
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:50,950
What are you guys doing?

1354
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:52,950
What are we all doing?

1355
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:54,370
OK.

1356
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:55,330
We're walking.

1357
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,210
That's our guy right there, right?

1358
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:01,350
Wow.

1359
01:20:02,870 --> 01:20:04,210
He walks his own path.

1360
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,930
Is an individual.

1361
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,320
Sir?

1362
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:26,220
Sir?

1363
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:29,160
Do you need me to be right behind you or...

1364
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:30,200
Closer?

1365
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,640
He's not whistling.

1366
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:35,360
He's not moving.

1367
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,840
Is it the wrong guy?

1368
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:37,580
Oh shoot.

1369
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,080
Money!

1370
01:20:42,380 --> 01:20:43,260
Wrong guy.

1371
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,320
Oh.

1372
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:49,580
No, that is not resistance member.

1373
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:52,060
Is that guy?

1374
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,160
Oh no, they are...

1375
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,760
OK, this guy is walking with purpose.

1376
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:01,720
I think this is our man.

1377
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:03,900
This is our man.

1378
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:05,940
Maybe.

1379
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:09,080
Oh yes, yes, yes.

1380
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,300
I'm walking chill with you.

1381
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:23,240
Wow, those birds are getting really close to your face.

1382
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,100
I like how they hit...

1383
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,400
At Raven with all the birds around.

1384
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,100
I'm gonna eat this ration and I'm gonna grab the other one.

1385
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,120
Orb.

1386
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:00,920
OK.

1387
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,320
Don't call me snake.

1388
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:05,800
Call me...

1389
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:06,980
Hotness.

1390
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,540
Call me...

1391
01:22:16,180 --> 01:22:18,840
Call me Cynthia Hot Lady.

1392
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,460
Call me...

1393
01:22:29,890 --> 01:22:31,130
Your forever babe.

1394
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,090
Hi Cynthia Hot Lady.

1395
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,250
Actually, you know what's a hot name?

1396
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:39,290
Sabrina.

1397
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:41,490
That's such a hot name.

1398
01:22:45,490 --> 01:22:46,710
Meep meep.

1399
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:47,490
Sorry.

1400
01:22:50,690 --> 01:22:51,990
Meep meep.

1401
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:54,530
Sabrina from Pokemon.

1402
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:56,130
Exactly, that's who I think of.

1403
01:22:57,150 --> 01:22:59,210
Sabrina from... The Teenage Witch?

1404
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,570
I prefer Salem.

1405
01:23:05,390 --> 01:23:05,970
Like Carpenter?

1406
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:07,310
Yes, Sabrina Carpenter.

1407
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:10,390
But no, I think of Sabrina from Pokemon.

1408
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:13,730
And that's my definitive...

1409
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:15,870
Oh yeah, that's why she's so hot.

1410
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:19,130
Gosh, can you walk any slower?

1411
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:21,070
Please, sir.

1412
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:32,550
Would you still hate us if we were a worm?

1413
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:36,250
Probably even more so.

1414
01:23:37,370 --> 01:23:39,010
No, I save worms.

1415
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:40,210
Do you guys not save worms?

1416
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:40,390
Worms.

1417
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:45,210
Like if a worm is...

1418
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,210
You know, you see a worm...

1419
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:52,870
On the side of the sidewalk, you don't save them?

1420
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:04,070
Oh my gosh, the slowest ever walker.

1421
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:06,110
Ever to exist.

1422
01:24:10,730 --> 01:24:11,250
Bye bye.

1423
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:12,390
Oh, okay, never mind.

1424
01:24:12,570 --> 01:24:14,310
Oh, he's back to normal.

1425
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,070
Why did you change out of your disguise?

1426
01:24:22,290 --> 01:24:23,410
He heard me.

1427
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:25,970
Are you self-conscious?

1428
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,910
I'd be like, nobody would ever hire you with the pace you go at.

1429
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,650
Oh wait!

1430
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:33,230
Uh-oh.

1431
01:24:33,630 --> 01:24:34,230
No, I wouldn't

1432
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:38,450
even move!

1433
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,090
Oh no.

1434
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:40,430
Guys, I'm sorry.

1435
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:41,870
The cutscene...

1436
01:24:41,870 --> 01:24:42,710
I

1437
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:50,180
didn't even move an inch.

1438
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:51,020
You guys saw that.

1439
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,860
I was just standing there and the cutscene happened.

1440
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:54,580
Oh no.

1441
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,620
Maybe we get one more shot.

1442
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,240
Oh!

1443
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:57,740
Oh!

1444
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,820
Wait, nope, never mind.

1445
01:24:58,900 --> 01:24:59,320
We're a lady.

1446
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:03,720
I'm sorry everybody.

1447
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,720
Just ignore the woman.

1448
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,060
I think he...

1449
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,540
Doesn't he... He changes though.

1450
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:14,780
From what I remember.

1451
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,560
I'm pretty sure he gets out of the outfit.

1452
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,900
I can't ignore a woman.

1453
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:20,600
Yes you can!

1454
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:21,240
Yes!

1455
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:21,860
See, see, see!

1456
01:25:21,940 --> 01:25:23,260
We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.

1457
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,440
We're okay.

1458
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Oh yeah.

1459
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,060
Show me, lady.

1460
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,300
Hey,

1461
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:48,840
what are you talking about?

1462
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,980
Angel.

1463
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:55,200
The posters!

1464
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,250
Should have been me!

1465
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:20,210
Wow, an apple.

1466
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:25,530
Lucky guy indeed.

1467
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:30,290
Should have been me!

1468
01:26:32,230 --> 01:26:35,150
Very impressive CQC, Snake.

1469
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:38,990
Are you my mama?

1470
01:26:40,130 --> 01:26:41,070
Are you...

1471
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:42,630
The Big Mama?

1472
01:26:42,630 --> 01:26:47,270
Call me Mama.

1473
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,270
Big Mama.

1474
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:00,050
Here's your gun.

1475
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:08,460
Okay, lore dump time.

1476
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,760
Children are terrible.

1477
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:43,140
You can't grow a human being in a test tube.

1478
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:44,580
Not even a clone.

1479
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,740
You need a woman's body to give it life.

1480
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,780
You mean...

1481
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:51,920
A surrogate mother.

1482
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,900
That's an awfully cold way to put it.

1483
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,240
I am your mother.

1484
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,380
I gave birth...

1485
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:01,800
For the Patriots.

1486
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:06,180
She can say the Patriots.

1487
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:14,140
Yummy.

1488
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,510
Mama.

1489
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:33,370
Mama.

1490
01:28:35,970 --> 01:28:36,450
Mama.

1491
01:28:42,540 --> 01:28:43,880
Big in Huawei.

1492
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,380
She's big in Japan.

1493
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,500
Liquid.

1494
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:52,760
Yeah.

1495
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:09,420
Zero.

1496
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:27,090
During the Cold War when the United States and the Soviet Union were still at odds.

1497
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:31,930
It was in that chaotic era that the Patriots were born.

1498
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:35,170
Forgot all about Zero.

1499
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:36,710
What do you mean?

1500
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:42,350
I was one of the founding members.

1501
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:44,410
You.

1502
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:52,290
Zero created the Patriots to manage and control the American state.

1503
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:56,450
That control endured long after the Cold War ended.

1504
01:29:57,450 --> 01:30:00,110
The organization became an empty shell.

1505
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,050
Continuing to function through A.I.s.

1506
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:08,370
Those A.I.s are responsible for the creation of the war economy.

1507
01:30:09,130 --> 01:30:12,030
And they gave rise to the sons of the Patriot system.

1508
01:30:13,670 --> 01:30:15,830
But I am partly to blame.

1509
01:30:16,630 --> 01:30:19,950
I bear some of the guilt for creating the organization.

1510
01:30:22,290 --> 01:30:24,750
It was right after I first met your father.

1511
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,030
Big Boss.

1512
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:32,890
Big Boss.

1513
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:38,890
Back in 1964 I was ordered to take part in a CIA op called Operation Snake Eater.

1514
01:30:39,310 --> 01:30:42,550
Which concerned a new weapon the Soviets were developing at the time.

1515
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:45,410
My mission was to support a certain agent.

1516
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:48,390
That agent later became Big Boss.

1517
01:30:48,550 --> 01:30:51,090
I knew him as Snake.

1518
01:30:51,090 --> 01:30:51,890
Snake?

1519
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:52,750
Yes.

1520
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:54,490
Naked Snake.

1521
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:56,710
That was his code name at the time.

1522
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:59,270
A name he would give to you.

1523
01:30:59,370 --> 01:31:00,910
I didn't get the naked part.

1524
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:03,950
The commander of this mission was a man called Zero.

1525
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:06,610
The head of Special Forces Unit Fox.

1526
01:31:06,810 --> 01:31:10,370
Back then I was working as a double agent for the Chinese.

1527
01:31:10,690 --> 01:31:15,110
My objective was to secure the location of the philosopher's legacy.

1528
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,550
A massive cache of hidden wealth.

1529
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,570
And report it to Beijing.

1530
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:24,850
I was to acquire a microfilm showing the location of secret funds.

1531
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:28,550
Funds amassed by the allied powers during World War 2.

1532
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,290
It's all about that money baby.

1533
01:31:31,370 --> 01:31:32,670
And was expelled from China.

1534
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:37,630
I took the apple from the snake and was cast out of Eden.

1535
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:40,790
After years on the run I ended up in Hanoi.

1536
01:31:41,330 --> 01:31:42,530
That's where I met him again.

1537
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:48,650
It was around then that Zero used the massive funds contained in the philosopher's legacy...

1538
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:50,210
to start a new organization.

1539
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:51,690
The Patriots.

1540
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:55,650
Which would carry out the final wishes of a certain legendary hero.

1541
01:31:56,510 --> 01:32:02,930
The initial membership consisted of Big Boss, Sigint, Paramedic and their commander Zero.

1542
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:05,470
Oh and there was one more...

1543
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:06,930
Oh just you know one guy.

1544
01:32:08,370 --> 01:32:10,090
Oh boy I wonder who.

1545
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:14,230
Who is now Liquid.

1546
01:32:15,210 --> 01:32:20,470
After your father rescued me in Hanoi I went to America and joined their organization.

1547
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:24,290
Zero's goal was to achieve a unity of thought and awareness.

1548
01:32:24,950 --> 01:32:26,930
He believed that was what the Boss wanted.

1549
01:32:27,470 --> 01:32:29,750
And the rest of the Patriots followed his lead.

1550
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,770
The Boss?

1551
01:32:30,930 --> 01:32:34,430
The Boss was a legendary hero from the Second World War.

1552
01:32:34,890 --> 01:32:36,690
Known as the Mother of Special Forces.

1553
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:40,830
She had an almost overwhelming charisma about her.

1554
01:32:40,830 --> 01:32:44,570
The CIA feared this, so they had her eliminated.

1555
01:32:45,090 --> 01:32:51,290
If she had survived, the world of the 21st century might have been a very different place.

1556
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:54,550
We were all influenced by the Boss's will.

1557
01:32:55,330 --> 01:32:59,470
It was what drove us to create this organization, to be closer to that spirit.

1558
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:05,390
Zero decided that in order to lead the people, we needed a special kind of icon.

1559
01:33:06,030 --> 01:33:10,030
So he turned to Big Boss, the last son of the Boss.

1560
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:13,510
He shared more of her life than anyone else.

1561
01:33:14,250 --> 01:33:19,110
It was Big Boss, the true heir to her legacy, who was best suited to play this role.

1562
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:29,090
Zero elevated Big Boss, the hero who saved the world, to the status of an idol.

1563
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:37,330
The truth behind Big Boss became riddled with exaggeration, misrepresentation and outright lies.

1564
01:33:37,330 --> 01:33:43,630
Zero disseminated these stories among the masses, and gathered the rich and powerful to his banner.

1565
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:52,010
Every era needs its symbols to control the people.

1566
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:55,330
Whether it be the stars and stripes...

1567
01:33:58,270 --> 01:33:59,150
Or the snakes.

1568
01:33:59,530 --> 01:34:01,370
Or the hammer and sickle.

1569
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:03,090
Close enough.

1570
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:09,170
The idol.

1571
01:34:09,370 --> 01:34:10,690
He's my idol, my oshi.

1572
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:13,450
As the times and currents of politics changed, so too did Zero.

1573
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:18,130
Eventually, he became a prisoner of his own lust for power.

1574
01:34:18,650 --> 01:34:23,110
Sparking friction between him and Big Boss, who resented playing the puppet.

1575
01:34:23,810 --> 01:34:28,510
With Big Boss drifting away, Zero realized he would need insurance.

1576
01:34:29,310 --> 01:34:33,950
Something that would perpetuate the existence of Big Boss, their organization's icon.

1577
01:34:33,950 --> 01:34:38,330
And so Zero secretly embarked on a new project.

1578
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:46,050
Its goal was to create a clone of Big Boss, the ultimate soldier.

1579
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:51,230
The project was led by Dr. Clark, known at the time as Paramedic.

1580
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:59,370
After dozens of failures, they finally, miraculously, succeeded in producing a fertilized egg.

1581
01:34:59,370 --> 01:35:05,170
The egg used in this successful in vitro fertilization came from Dr. Clark's assistant.

1582
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:10,910
Blood from the East flowed within your veins.

1583
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:13,750
Give birth to Big Boss.

1584
01:35:14,090 --> 01:35:15,650
Don't forget he is half Japanese!

1585
01:35:16,310 --> 01:35:18,530
I asked to serve as the surrogate mother.

1586
01:35:19,050 --> 01:35:20,430
He's half Japanese everybody!

1587
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,490
I loved him.

1588
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:25,210
Everyone...

1589
01:35:25,210 --> 01:35:29,450
Nine months later, I gave birth to two Big Bosses.

1590
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,090
You and Liquid.

1591
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:31,950
Babies.

1592
01:35:32,410 --> 01:35:37,170
It didn't matter that you were clones or that they had manipulated your DNA.

1593
01:35:38,030 --> 01:35:41,870
You were born the same way as any other normal child.

1594
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:43,870
From your mother's womb.

1595
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:48,490
I like how the lady...

1596
01:35:48,490 --> 01:35:50,790
proved to be the final straw for Zero and Big Boss.

1597
01:35:52,530 --> 01:35:57,730
Determined to oppose Zero and his plans, Big Boss broke away from the Big Boss.

1598
01:35:58,090 --> 01:36:03,750
He left the business, created his own mercenary company, and drifted around the world.

1599
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:07,130
I'm sorry.

1600
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,990
Your father never wanted you.

1601
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:13,510
Human life isn't meant to be manipulated like that.

1602
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:17,390
I knew that, but I wanted you.

1603
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:21,410
You just wanted the Boss' babies.

1604
01:36:21,890 --> 01:36:23,050
It's crazy.

1605
01:36:24,170 --> 01:36:28,710
What Zero wanted was an orderly world, one governed by rules.

1606
01:36:29,390 --> 01:36:36,110
His fortune grew through countless wars, and his words influenced decision-making all the way up to the Oval Office.

1607
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:45,310
As the world saw the rise of digital technology, IT, the internet, and genetics, the Patriots' power grew...

1608
01:36:45,310 --> 01:36:46,890
He's absorbing all this information.

1609
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:51,010
Their roots spread and took hold throughout the globe.

1610
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:57,110
In time, it began to dictate the fate of entire nations from the shadows.

1611
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:07,030
And before we knew it, the Patriots, the proud police of the world, started bringing an entire planet under their control.

1612
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:11,050
Save the game.

1613
01:37:13,110 --> 01:37:13,470
Loud.

1614
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:17,690
I'm just gonna keep doing new saves.

1615
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:20,030
You guys, oh my gosh, before I continue...

1616
01:37:21,710 --> 01:37:22,070
Nevermind.

1617
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:27,310
Nevermind, I don't have a choice.

1618
01:37:27,410 --> 01:37:31,150
I was gonna explain something I tried to do, but next time I save I'll...

1619
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:31,950
I'll explain it.

1620
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:33,830
But their execution was flawed.

1621
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:44,270
Zero developed weapons, amassed armies, used information for extortion, all in order to gain more wealth.

1622
01:37:45,290 --> 01:37:50,090
He was obsessed with controlling awareness on the inside from the outside.

1623
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:53,150
But...

1624
01:37:53,550 --> 01:37:57,310
I cannot imagine that's what the boss would have wanted.

1625
01:37:58,810 --> 01:38:01,210
They both misinterpreted her will.

1626
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:09,370
They're all silly.

1627
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:17,670
So began the war between Zero and Big Boss.

1628
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:19,990
Oh yeah.

1629
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:25,570
Opposing interpretations, each striving to realize the boss's will.

1630
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:27,070
And strange love, you know.

1631
01:38:27,910 --> 01:38:32,170
Everything you see today stems from their cold war.

1632
01:38:32,210 --> 01:38:34,330
Just two guys with mummy issues.

1633
01:38:36,490 --> 01:38:38,070
Putting the whole world in chaos.

1634
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,990
Damn,

1635
01:38:57,270 --> 01:38:58,090
Eva's got abs.

1636
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,120
Mammy.

1637
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:16,380
There was nothing left of the boss's noble will in their struggle.

1638
01:39:17,220 --> 01:39:18,700
All that remained was hatred.

1639
01:39:19,180 --> 01:39:20,740
A passion to destroy one another.

1640
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:24,000
Big Boss returned to the U.S.

1641
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:27,920
with a plan in mind, and once again assumed command of Foxhound.

1642
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:28,660
Foxhound?

1643
01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:31,920
In Outer Heaven, and then Zanzibar Land...

1644
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:32,800
Zanzibar Land!

1645
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,760
Big Boss plotted coup d'etat against Zero.

1646
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:42,080
But you, Solid Snake, his own clone, foiled his plan four times.

1647
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:47,760
Big Boss and Gray Fox, Frank Jaeger, left near death.

1648
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,920
Zero recovered their bodies.

1649
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:54,740
Frank Jaeger's entire body was reconstructed through surgery.

1650
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,260
And he was reborn as the Cyborg Ninja.

1651
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,140
I should have just left him for dead.

1652
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:06,660
Big Boss, now a vegetable, became a prisoner of Zero even in death.

1653
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:15,060
For Zero, more than anyone else, your father was an irreplaceable icon.

1654
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,700
No, the truth is, for Zero, he was an irreplaceable friend.

1655
01:40:23,380 --> 01:40:29,160
After Big Boss' betrayal, Zero could no longer believe in something so uncertain as life.

1656
01:40:30,140 --> 01:40:31,680
He lost his belief in everything.

1657
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:34,520
Nations, organizations, individuals.

1658
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:40,480
Zero was no longer willing to place his organization in the hands of the next generation.

1659
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:49,060
Instead, he set up a network of AIs, a decision-making system formed from all the information he had accumulated.

1660
01:40:49,880 --> 01:40:52,980
He built four AIs, GW...

1661
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:56,920
But your AIs are gonna be wrong if you already had the wrong interpretation.

1662
01:40:58,060 --> 01:40:59,160
Stupid ass.

1663
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,920
If the information you're feeding them is the information you know.

1664
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:22,860
Did they make AI art though?

1665
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:29,000
Yeah, make them... I guess that's the only way you can make them worse.

1666
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:33,120
Big Boss isn't allowed to live or die.

1667
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,380
He's trapped for eternity in a brain-dead prison.

1668
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:44,320
To bind himself to his friend, to ensure his rule over the world, Zero transformed Big Boss into an icon.

1669
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:46,800
Neither living nor dead.

1670
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,160
Sounds almost like a religion.

1671
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:54,240
Naturally, Ocelot and I planned to free him from Zero's prison.

1672
01:41:55,060 --> 01:42:00,700
We enlisted Naomi Hunter, an authority in the field of nanomachine research, into our organization.

1673
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,440
And we used Frank Yeager to kill Dr. Clark.

1674
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:10,840
Ocelot tortured the DARPA chief Donald Anderson, also known as Sigint, to death.

1675
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:14,020
I love how they just throw that in.

1676
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:20,640
With Paramedic and Sigint dead, Zero was the only one left.

1677
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:23,200
But we too paid a price.

1678
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:25,760
I lost Ocelot.

1679
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:30,840
But you know it's him if you read the ending game timeline.

1680
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,440
And certainly not for Zero.

1681
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:35,220
He was fighting for Big Boss.

1682
01:42:36,440 --> 01:42:38,060
He idolized him.

1683
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:47,790
Spoilers where?

1684
01:42:47,790 --> 01:42:50,790
What are you talking about?

1685
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:54,750
Huh?

1686
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,410
I didn't say spoilers.

1687
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:08,290
Raiden.

1688
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:15,350
Raiden's... everyone's always sticking their nose where they don't belong.

1689
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:21,750
Prosper, welcome to the membership.

1690
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:22,790
Thank you.

1691
01:43:29,170 --> 01:43:33,970
I'm so glad they took off the beauty face.

1692
01:43:38,030 --> 01:43:39,290
So glad.

1693
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,420
To eat him.

1694
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,660
Zero wanted to create a messiah.

1695
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:54,160
A legend.

1696
01:43:55,740 --> 01:43:56,940
That would never die.

1697
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:06,220
I mean, but nobody wants Soup as a hero.

1698
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:10,920
Oh my hero, he's Soup.

1699
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:17,300
He's literally like mush in there.

1700
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:22,140
Soup Snake.

1701
01:44:24,100 --> 01:44:26,960
The real Liquid Snake is in there.

1702
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:33,520
Oh my god.

1703
01:44:33,900 --> 01:44:36,020
I feel so bad for Eva too.

1704
01:44:36,200 --> 01:44:40,360
Imagine seeing the person you loved as Soup.

1705
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,640
In like a...

1706
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:44,080
Like whatever this is.

1707
01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:49,460
This... oh my god, it's so gross.

1708
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,420
This is so messed up.

1709
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,580
Manipulating people's minds for the sake of his own ego.

1710
01:45:20,760 --> 01:45:23,880
It's so... it's... oh my god.

1711
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:28,620
Wonder how he tastes.

1712
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:32,260
There's a lot of salt in there probably.

1713
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,900
Metal Gear Solid 3 Soup Eater.

1714
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,320
Oh god.

1715
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:50,740
Oh my god.

1716
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:53,400
Oh wow.

1717
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,160
Oh no.

1718
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:11,820
I sure hope there's not three guys in a trench coat.

1719
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,000
Ah...

1720
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,880
Oh wow, look at that swagger.

1721
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:39,300
Oh, there really is three guys in a trench coat.

1722
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:39,900
Move!

1723
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:44,660
Yeah, take care of them Big Mama!

1724
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:56,980
Oh, it should have been me.

1725
01:46:57,340 --> 01:46:59,620
Oh my god.

1726
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:02,500
Eva!

1727
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:13,920
Autobots?

1728
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:16,060
What do you want?

1729
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:31,400
OK OK Yes ma'am

1730
01:47:36,540 --> 01:47:37,940
Yeah!

1731
01:47:44,270 --> 01:47:45,630
Triumph!

1732
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:52,250
Oh, she's a beaut.

1733
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:54,550
Oh, she's so shiny.

1734
01:47:54,710 --> 01:47:55,750
So well taken care of.

1735
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:05,010
Ugh, those dang video games.

1736
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:29,130
lol It's me right now.

1737
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:34,250
Those dang video games.

1738
01:48:36,270 --> 01:48:40,050
I like how she says children, but these look like grown ass men.

1739
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:44,530
These are... these are... these are real men.

1740
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:46,930
Children where?

1741
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:51,130
lol Oh yeah.

1742
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:58,530
Children to her.

1743
01:49:01,470 --> 01:49:04,690
Marvel Rivals is a plot by Marvel.

1744
01:49:05,690 --> 01:49:06,790
Yeah!

1745
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:20,370
Popeye and Snake.

1746
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:22,570
Oh my gosh, just like old times.

1747
01:49:27,550 --> 01:49:28,190
Mom!

1748
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:34,190
I'm not gonna be weird.

1749
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:35,450
It's my actual mom.

1750
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:39,090
Well, it's Snake's actual mom.

1751
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:49,310
lol Maybe she's gonna be weird though.

1752
01:49:52,310 --> 01:49:54,470
A while?

1753
01:50:06,580 --> 01:50:07,120
No!

1754
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:09,760
Big Mama!

1755
01:50:13,940 --> 01:50:14,120
No!

1756
01:50:18,700 --> 01:50:23,360
Before we do this part though, I really have to pee.

1757
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,980
So we'll just watch all of this and then as soon as it starts I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

1758
01:50:32,680 --> 01:50:33,880
I gotta go!

1759
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:35,240
I'm so fast!

1760
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,960
I'm like the fast 10 minutes.

1761
01:50:52,650 --> 01:50:53,290
Please!

1762
01:50:53,790 --> 01:50:55,150
Or I'm going to!

1763
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,080
Oh please!

1764
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:10,280
Please.

1765
01:51:10,500 --> 01:51:11,140
Oh my god.

1766
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,040
My ectoplasm.

1767
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:18,140
Okay.

1768
01:53:09,640 --> 01:53:10,760
Okay, I'm back.

1769
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,920
I... I open my door and Pies comes running at me.

1770
01:53:17,180 --> 01:53:19,880
She's like... because she likes to hide in my room.

1771
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:27,320
And then I go to the bathroom and I hear... I hear Butaro sneeze.

1772
01:53:28,480 --> 01:53:29,680
My cats are so cute.

1773
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:30,400
Welcome back!

1774
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:31,400
I'm back!

1775
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:33,040
Do you wash your hands?

1776
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,540
I always wash my hands.

1777
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:35,940
I do.

1778
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:36,780
Alright.

1779
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:38,680
Let's go baby!

1780
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:44,100
No matter what!

1781
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:47,140
Okay!

1782
01:53:47,140 --> 01:53:48,780
Oh god.

1783
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:53,820
Oh,

1784
01:53:58,280 --> 01:53:59,280
that's a good guy.

1785
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:02,980
I

1786
01:54:08,090 --> 01:54:10,150
wonder if I have this.

1787
01:54:11,090 --> 01:54:12,390
What am I using right now?

1788
01:54:16,010 --> 01:54:18,050
Let's use... I wanna try... Okay.

1789
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,020
I don't... Okay.

1790
01:54:24,540 --> 01:54:26,080
Yeah, we wanted the Patriot.

1791
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:27,300
Oh yeah, turn on auto-aim.

1792
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:28,060
You're so right.

1793
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:30,120
It's good to use here.

1794
01:54:31,060 --> 01:54:33,460
Okay, you guys are not ready for what the Patriot does.

1795
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:36,280
It's so good if you've never seen it.

1796
01:54:36,820 --> 01:54:37,680
Oh, it's so good.

1797
01:54:37,740 --> 01:54:38,160
Okay, ready?

1798
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:43,780
Oh, I don't have it equipped.

1799
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:44,560
Equip!

1800
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:44,920
Equip!

1801
01:54:45,020 --> 01:54:45,340
Equip!

1802
01:54:56,430 --> 01:54:57,750
I can't see anything!

1803
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:01,810
I can't see anything!

1804
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:03,650
I'm trying!

1805
01:55:09,360 --> 01:55:09,920
I'm shooting.

1806
01:55:15,930 --> 01:55:17,070
Yeah, get his ass!

1807
01:55:18,990 --> 01:55:19,850
Get his ass!

1808
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:20,550
Get his ass!

1809
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:22,150
Oh my god!

1810
01:55:22,230 --> 01:55:22,510
Oh my god!

1811
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,990
Oh my god!

1812
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:23,410
Oh my god!

1813
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:52,830
It's so good.

1814
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:25,980
Get them Snake!

1815
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:26,520
Get them!

1816
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:03,970
There is no one else.

1817
01:57:04,350 --> 01:57:05,110
I got them all.

1818
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:09,910
So much for a peaceful run, right?

1819
01:57:14,330 --> 01:57:15,850
Oh, those are our friends.

1820
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:16,230
Just kidding.

1821
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:21,190
That's the

1822
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,080
right...

1823
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,000
rubber bullets?

1824
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:32,040
Yeah, yeah.

1825
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,140
Oh my god, the froggies.

1826
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:36,100
Our froggies!

1827
01:57:44,600 --> 01:57:45,460
Oh my god.

1828
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:46,040
Oh my god!

1829
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:46,760
I can't see anything!

1830
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,060
I can't see anything!

1831
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,380
I'm just auto locked on!

1832
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:51,760
I'm just shooting!

1833
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,120
I'm just going!

1834
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:00,880
I just shoot to kill!

1835
01:58:01,300 --> 01:58:02,600
It doesn't matter what!

1836
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:28,600
I did that last week.

1837
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:32,540
Just get me talking about Naomi.

1838
01:58:32,700 --> 01:58:33,880
I'll show you my rage.

1839
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:43,480
I definitely don't think they wanted Big Boss blown up!

1840
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:48,780
Greetings Europe!

1841
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:51,440
Hello Europe!

1842
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:57,460
It's a lot more chaotic here than I thought it would be.

1843
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:04,260
Where do you get the figure in this stage?

1844
01:59:04,260 --> 01:59:07,040
We do have to fight Raging Raven.

1845
01:59:09,220 --> 01:59:10,280
We'll get it there.

1846
01:59:18,650 --> 01:59:19,430
Oh no.

1847
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:21,810
No!

1848
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:31,780
Yeah baby!

1849
01:59:37,450 --> 01:59:38,290
OK Kiba.

1850
01:59:38,790 --> 01:59:39,790
I'm not auto aiming.

1851
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:40,750
That means it's not me.

1852
01:59:41,150 --> 01:59:42,010
It's a game issue.

1853
01:59:43,530 --> 01:59:43,770
I

1854
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:01,320
got you!

1855
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,600
Oh my god, she loves me!

1856
02:00:06,940 --> 02:00:08,260
She loves me!

1857
02:00:08,660 --> 02:00:11,520
My mom is giving me praise!

1858
02:00:26,400 --> 02:00:28,900
I wonder what my death count is going to be like here.

1859
02:00:30,080 --> 02:00:32,080
What's my death count going to be here?

1860
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:32,580
I'm scared.

1861
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:44,780
I got you.

1862
02:00:45,080 --> 02:00:46,000
I already got him.

1863
02:00:46,040 --> 02:00:47,060
He didn't even need to tell me.

1864
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:47,740
He's dead.

1865
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:50,820
I even auto caught.

1866
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,880
Everybody is so happy for me.

1867
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:57,740
Who's driving this thing?

1868
02:00:58,680 --> 02:00:59,120
Hello?

1869
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:05,360
I got him.

1870
02:01:06,260 --> 02:01:07,020
Probably.

1871
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,280
I love the Patriot.

1872
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:24,340
Here they come!

1873
02:01:33,260 --> 02:01:34,360
Let's go.

1874
02:01:35,300 --> 02:01:38,370
I got her.

1875
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:41,150
Guys,

1876
02:01:49,890 --> 02:01:50,830
this is great gameplay.

1877
02:01:51,550 --> 02:01:51,990
I'm alright.

1878
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,980
I'm just holding down and shooting.

1879
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:14,880
Yeah, but the cinematics are crazy.

1880
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:15,780
Right on!

1881
02:02:18,520 --> 02:02:20,220
Oh my god, Shaggycon.

1882
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:22,040
We'll

1883
02:02:28,020 --> 02:02:29,660
get revenge for you, mama!

1884
02:02:38,660 --> 02:02:40,540
Oh my goodness, I can't see anything.

1885
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:43,180
It's all just chaos craziness here.

1886
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:47,260
Oh my god!

1887
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:51,040
I can't see anything!

1888
02:02:51,980 --> 02:02:55,900
What the hell is happening?

1889
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,120
The world's greatest chase scene ever!

1890
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:04,200
I'm still fighting!

1891
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:06,740
Did we?

1892
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,140
They were right behind us.

1893
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:10,740
I don't think we did.

1894
02:03:16,810 --> 02:03:18,330
What a thrill.

1895
02:03:18,750 --> 02:03:20,310
My god!

1896
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:29,060
There it is.

1897
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,540
The van.

1898
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:36,880
OK Eyes on the road, buddy.

1899
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:37,760
Eyes on the road.

1900
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:39,320
They are right behind us again.

1901
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:40,120
No!

1902
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:00,550
The soup.

1903
02:04:12,400 --> 02:04:15,420
Eva, I need you.

1904
02:04:16,270 --> 02:04:17,940
Is that you?

1905
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:28,180
A mother's work is never done.

1906
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:36,760
Help me, mama!

1907
02:04:48,600 --> 02:04:49,560
Not again.

1908
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:56,640
No one got involved.

1909
02:04:56,740 --> 02:04:57,520
I know, right?

1910
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:01,880
If I were a pedestrian, I would not be going outside.

1911
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:02,340
Hell no.

1912
02:05:20,170 --> 02:05:21,550
Use the cure menu.

1913
02:05:22,410 --> 02:05:22,850
Oh my god.

1914
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:24,690
His booty.

1915
02:05:27,010 --> 02:05:27,870
It's sore.

1916
02:05:27,870 --> 02:05:29,370
The children!

1917
02:06:00,420 --> 02:06:04,640
Maybe also call medical help.

1918
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:07,660
Please.

1919
02:06:39,840 --> 02:06:45,980
Oh gosh, I don't remember how to fight Raging Raven.

1920
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:51,980
I don't remember how...

1921
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,640
Oh shoot.

1922
02:06:55,480 --> 02:06:56,420
Alright, well.

1923
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:59,920
Also, where the heck will her statue be?

1924
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:00,440
OK.

1925
02:07:00,920 --> 02:07:01,520
Oh gosh.

1926
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:05,400
The Mosin.

1927
02:07:05,720 --> 02:07:07,780
Yeah, I think that's what we'll have to use.

1928
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:09,180
That's what I was thinking too.

1929
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:13,000
I wish I could just go blasting with my Patriot.

1930
02:07:16,140 --> 02:07:19,020
I wish I could just go blasting with my Patriot.

1931
02:07:19,080 --> 02:07:20,060
Oh gosh.

1932
02:07:21,120 --> 02:07:23,060
Ah, I forgot that it was this soon.

1933
02:07:25,800 --> 02:07:28,440
I thought it was... Actually, I couldn't remember what it was.

1934
02:07:29,660 --> 02:07:31,960
I was completely wrong with what I remembered.

1935
02:07:32,180 --> 02:07:33,420
Oh no, Snake, the syringe!

1936
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,540
Oh my gosh, Naomi, now is not the time!

1937
02:07:40,860 --> 02:07:44,800
Why do you have to make such a flawed product and then give it to the masses?

1938
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:54,820
The IVS.

1939
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:03,320
We get it, you're a bird.

1940
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:04,360
Oh my god.

1941
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:05,080
Ah!

1942
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:31,940
I love the overlapping voices.

1943
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,900
They're so cool!

1944
02:08:36,780 --> 02:08:39,900
The overlapping voices is so awesome.

1945
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:46,540
They

1946
02:08:50,690 --> 02:08:52,010
sound so awesome.

1947
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:55,570
OK, alright, OK, alright, OK, alright.

1948
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:59,490
Oh gosh, I don't remember how to do this fight, but I'll do my best.

1949
02:09:00,110 --> 02:09:02,490
OK, we have the Mosin actually in.

1950
02:09:02,490 --> 02:09:06,210
I am gonna switch from this just to have our...

1951
02:09:06,210 --> 02:09:10,830
Is there anything else that I can use that...

1952
02:09:10,830 --> 02:09:13,630
Like, does this have rubber bullets?

1953
02:09:14,990 --> 02:09:16,490
Can I get...

1954
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:22,860
No!

1955
02:09:24,380 --> 02:09:25,500
The shotty.

1956
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:27,720
Is the shotgun the only other thing?

1957
02:09:29,580 --> 02:09:35,260
But the shotgun is only good if she comes close and she's kind of a far away fight.

1958
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:43,840
V-Ring or Mosin?

1959
02:09:47,220 --> 02:09:49,020
Wish I could use my real gun.

1960
02:09:54,060 --> 02:09:55,860
OMG, it's the wings from Fortnite.

1961
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:06,060
You know what, let's just have it equipped just in case because, you know, anything that doesn't do...

1962
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:09,240
Damage damage, I think is good.

1963
02:10:09,240 --> 02:10:11,940
Hold on, I wanna see something real quick.

1964
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:18,090
I think we can only use this against...

1965
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:24,760
I think we can only use this against...

1966
02:10:26,260 --> 02:10:27,560
The last one.

1967
02:10:34,480 --> 02:10:35,320
OK, um...

1968
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:36,520
I don't know if... Oh wait.

1969
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:40,040
I have smoke grenades but they're ID locked, that's so messed up.

1970
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:49,700
OK, um...

1971
02:10:49,700 --> 02:10:51,360
I can't help me.

1972
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:02,620
Oh, I didn't even know there were searchlights.

1973
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,120
Thank you.

1974
02:11:08,580 --> 02:11:10,100
Oh, it says the same thing.

1975
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:14,660
OK...

1976
02:11:24,440 --> 02:11:26,340
They spotted me right away.

1977
02:11:34,370 --> 02:11:35,910
OK, um, shoot.

1978
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:44,570
Oh, shoot.

1979
02:11:45,370 --> 02:11:46,850
Wait, how do I... Oh, like that.

1980
02:11:47,030 --> 02:11:47,490
Did

1981
02:11:56,160 --> 02:11:57,360
I get her?

1982
02:11:57,440 --> 02:11:58,400
No, I didn't even.

1983
02:11:58,940 --> 02:11:59,560
This sucks.

1984
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:03,600
Can you, like, come over here?

1985
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:15,140
Why didn't it shoot?

1986
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,160
Was I too close to the wall?

1987
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:28,340
Ah!

1988
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:31,420
Oh my god.

1989
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,460
I don't remember this fight at all.

1990
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:36,120
I'm sorry guys.

1991
02:12:36,940 --> 02:12:37,680
I'm so sorry.

1992
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:40,120
It'll take me a second to get used to it.

1993
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:40,720
I'll get it.

1994
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:42,000
What's coming?

1995
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:44,600
OK, what's coming?

1996
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:45,420
What does that mean?

1997
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:46,320
Who?

1998
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:46,860
Me?

1999
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:47,560
What?

2000
02:12:51,640 --> 02:12:52,080
Snake.

2001
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:02,660
Oh my god, I can't see anything.

2002
02:13:06,220 --> 02:13:07,000
Oh, hello.

2003
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,660
Oh my god.

2004
02:13:10,560 --> 02:13:11,260
Get up, snake.

2005
02:13:11,420 --> 02:13:11,860
Oh, shoot.

2006
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:19,520
I'm just standing out in the open.

2007
02:13:21,300 --> 02:13:22,280
With this thing.

2008
02:13:22,640 --> 02:13:24,820
Maybe I should have switched to the shotgun there.

2009
02:13:25,560 --> 02:13:26,880
I should have switched to the shotgun.

2010
02:13:27,340 --> 02:13:29,340
It's OK, I'm panicking a little bit.

2011
02:13:34,260 --> 02:13:34,760
OK.

2012
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:35,700
She's so fast.

2013
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:38,280
OK,

2014
02:14:01,100 --> 02:14:02,380
where is my... Alright.

2015
02:14:13,450 --> 02:14:14,430
Get up, snake!

2016
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:15,650
Get up, snake!

2017
02:14:20,900 --> 02:14:22,220
You are overheating.

2018
02:14:24,640 --> 02:14:25,320
Oh no.

2019
02:14:25,440 --> 02:14:26,140
Oh no, no, no!

2020
02:14:33,750 --> 02:14:35,150
Who's... You're telling me...

2021
02:14:37,210 --> 02:14:37,970
Maybe here.

2022
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:40,770
Which one is she?

2023
02:14:41,010 --> 02:14:41,510
Oh shoot.

2024
02:14:43,470 --> 02:14:44,290
I don't know.

2025
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:48,850
Oh shoot!

2026
02:14:49,310 --> 02:14:49,790
I don't know!

2027
02:14:50,470 --> 02:14:51,350
Oh wait, is that her?

2028
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:06,160
Wait.

2029
02:15:10,040 --> 02:15:11,060
There she is again.

2030
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,080
Wait, yeah.

2031
02:15:12,840 --> 02:15:13,980
I wonder if I can get her again.

2032
02:15:15,580 --> 02:15:16,560
Oh, is that her?

2033
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:17,640
I think so.

2034
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:21,780
Oh shoot!

2035
02:15:21,960 --> 02:15:23,640
I didn't realize I had no bullets in.

2036
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:24,280
Oh my god.

2037
02:15:24,520 --> 02:15:24,760
No!

2038
02:15:48,670 --> 02:15:50,390
I think I just saw her!

2039
02:16:03,770 --> 02:16:04,950
Are you gonna come in here?

2040
02:16:05,370 --> 02:16:05,850
Or...

2041
02:16:05,850 --> 02:16:05,850
I

2042
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:11,360
think she's gonna be too fast.

2043
02:16:15,200 --> 02:16:16,860
Oh my goodness lady.

2044
02:16:28,940 --> 02:16:29,900
Ah, shoot!

2045
02:16:34,330 --> 02:16:35,170
Come on!

2046
02:16:35,430 --> 02:16:36,670
Oh my god.

2047
02:16:38,030 --> 02:16:40,530
I tried... What happened to my gun?

2048
02:16:41,170 --> 02:16:41,570
Snake!

2049
02:16:43,650 --> 02:16:45,110
What happened to it?

2050
02:16:48,250 --> 02:16:49,630
Oh my god.

2051
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:50,330
Auto-aim please.

2052
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:51,050
Auto-aim!

2053
02:16:51,290 --> 02:16:51,530
Auto-aim!

2054
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:52,390
Auto-aim!

2055
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:56,640
Maybe I don't want it on after all.

2056
02:16:56,640 --> 02:16:57,140
Ah!

2057
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:09,720
Holy moly, what is she doing?

2058
02:17:11,340 --> 02:17:13,400
I can't read her movements at all you guys.

2059
02:17:13,480 --> 02:17:14,800
This fight is so tricky for me.

2060
02:17:14,960 --> 02:17:16,400
This fight is so hard for me.

2061
02:17:17,640 --> 02:17:18,880
I can't read anything.

2062
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:21,040
Everything feels like it's all over the place.

2063
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:22,240
Like for real.

2064
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:29,440
Please!

2065
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:40,320
I can't read anything.

2066
02:17:42,740 --> 02:17:44,000
She's so fast.

2067
02:17:44,040 --> 02:17:44,580
She is!

2068
02:17:52,040 --> 02:17:53,140
I'm going back down here.

2069
02:17:54,060 --> 02:17:56,800
I feel like I can have more place to roam around here.

2070
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:59,260
I just don't know.

2071
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:02,780
Oh, it's quiet.

2072
02:18:02,780 --> 02:18:02,840
Okay.

2073
02:18:04,640 --> 02:18:05,100
Alright.

2074
02:18:28,280 --> 02:18:31,660
I'm going back downstairs to get the other ration that was down here.

2075
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:36,050
The thermal health?

2076
02:18:36,190 --> 02:18:37,690
I'm not sure actually.

2077
02:18:39,790 --> 02:18:41,130
I don't know.

2078
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:42,210
This is a question.

2079
02:18:42,670 --> 02:18:43,650
I'm gonna try it.

2080
02:18:50,400 --> 02:18:51,460
What's select mode?

2081
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:54,300
Oh.

2082
02:18:54,540 --> 02:18:54,840
Oh.

2083
02:18:55,320 --> 02:18:56,060
I'm binoculars.

2084
02:18:57,400 --> 02:18:58,040
I'm...

2085
02:18:58,980 --> 02:19:01,000
It said what's select mode.

2086
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:10,320
Oh, Sunny!

2087
02:19:20,200 --> 02:19:21,040
Silly me!

2088
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,680
Silly me!

2089
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:28,280
Oh, I don't think I can see anything in...

2090
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:29,620
Oh gosh!

2091
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:30,020
No.

2092
02:19:30,180 --> 02:19:30,280
No.

2093
02:19:30,420 --> 02:19:30,600
No.

2094
02:19:30,720 --> 02:19:30,900
No.

2095
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:31,060
No.

2096
02:19:31,160 --> 02:19:31,240
No.

2097
02:19:31,240 --> 02:19:31,280
No.

2098
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:31,500
No.

2099
02:19:31,520 --> 02:19:31,560
No.

2100
02:19:31,820 --> 02:19:32,260
Normal.

2101
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:35,860
Twin barrel.

2102
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:38,920
Yeah!

2103
02:19:39,820 --> 02:19:40,280
We got her.

2104
02:19:40,400 --> 02:19:40,500
Nice.

2105
02:19:48,140 --> 02:19:48,840
Nice suit.

2106
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:54,460
What?

2107
02:19:54,620 --> 02:19:55,500
What do you mean I'm not here?

2108
02:20:01,620 --> 02:20:02,060
Okay.

2109
02:20:04,880 --> 02:20:05,320
Sorry.

2110
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:06,520
I'm getting a little panicky.

2111
02:20:07,160 --> 02:20:08,420
I'm getting a little panicky.

2112
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:12,120
It's hard for me to...

2113
02:20:15,240 --> 02:20:17,720
It's hard for me to control movement sometimes.

2114
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,480
I get panicky, especially in this fight.

2115
02:20:21,360 --> 02:20:23,620
I don't know what to do at all.

2116
02:20:25,980 --> 02:20:26,720
Oh shoot.

2117
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:29,240
I'm gonna go back upstairs.

2118
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:34,620
Oh

2119
02:20:46,740 --> 02:20:47,520
my gosh!

2120
02:20:47,560 --> 02:20:48,100
That was so close.

2121
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:49,000
Oh!

2122
02:20:49,160 --> 02:20:49,360
Oh!

2123
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:50,060
Oh my god!

2124
02:21:01,210 --> 02:21:04,310
I wish I could reload how I used to in the old days.

2125
02:21:04,650 --> 02:21:04,970
Oh no.

2126
02:21:05,090 --> 02:21:05,170
No.

2127
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:05,430
No.

2128
02:21:05,550 --> 02:21:06,270
I'm out of ammo.

2129
02:21:06,410 --> 02:21:06,590
Am I?

2130
02:21:09,030 --> 02:21:10,730
What is a...

2131
02:21:12,030 --> 02:21:12,910
What does it use?

2132
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,060
What does it use?

2133
02:21:21,440 --> 02:21:22,520
It uses... Oh, the V-Ring.

2134
02:21:22,620 --> 02:21:22,900
That's right.

2135
02:21:22,980 --> 02:21:23,340
V-Ring.

2136
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:24,420
V-Ring ammo.

2137
02:21:24,600 --> 02:21:24,700
Yeah.

2138
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:24,840
Yeah.

2139
02:21:24,840 --> 02:21:25,040
Yeah.

2140
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:25,320
Yeah.

2141
02:21:25,640 --> 02:21:25,960
Yeah.

2142
02:21:26,200 --> 02:21:26,520
Yeah.

2143
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:26,660
Yeah.

2144
02:21:26,840 --> 02:21:27,320
Thank you.

2145
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:27,740
Thank you.

2146
02:21:28,900 --> 02:21:29,320
Thank you.

2147
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:29,680
Thank you.

2148
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:30,460
Thank you.

2149
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:42,260
Okay.

2150
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:47,540
Okay.

2151
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,020
Should be okay.

2152
02:21:54,820 --> 02:21:56,280
I really can't see anything.

2153
02:21:56,960 --> 02:21:57,500
Holy cow.

2154
02:21:58,160 --> 02:21:58,880
She got me good.

2155
02:21:59,340 --> 02:21:59,960
She got me.

2156
02:22:00,520 --> 02:22:01,340
Holy cow.

2157
02:22:04,730 --> 02:22:05,610
Oh, that was close.

2158
02:22:11,490 --> 02:22:12,970
Oh, we're back to...

2159
02:22:15,350 --> 02:22:16,550
Oh, she's here again.

2160
02:22:16,630 --> 02:22:16,990
That's right.

2161
02:22:37,450 --> 02:22:40,290
I don't need laser eye surgery anymore.

2162
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:42,070
I'm happy for you.

2163
02:22:43,910 --> 02:22:45,070
There she is.

2164
02:22:46,150 --> 02:22:48,350
I wish I could... I wonder...

2165
02:22:49,530 --> 02:22:55,010
Where did she

2166
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:01,920
go?

2167
02:23:02,300 --> 02:23:03,900
I think that's her right there.

2168
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:07,280
Does

2169
02:23:14,320 --> 02:23:15,260
that hurt?

2170
02:23:15,320 --> 02:23:15,480
No.

2171
02:23:16,200 --> 02:23:17,080
That's her!

2172
02:23:24,870 --> 02:23:26,310
Stop not moving.

2173
02:23:26,970 --> 02:23:28,850
Oh, there she is.

2174
02:23:30,230 --> 02:23:30,750
No!

2175
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:35,940
My shot!

2176
02:23:49,180 --> 02:23:50,160
Come on, snake!

2177
02:23:50,640 --> 02:23:51,860
Snake, get out of fire.

2178
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:53,920
Stop being on fire.

2179
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:57,340
That's mean.

2180
02:23:58,960 --> 02:24:00,500
We're so close.

2181
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,000
We're so close.

2182
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:03,680
How did I not get caught?

2183
02:24:04,040 --> 02:24:05,020
Maybe I did get caught.

2184
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:06,900
There she is.

2185
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:07,580
There she is.

2186
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:14,010
We're so close.

2187
02:24:29,740 --> 02:24:30,680
Good stuff.

2188
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:38,930
Now, if I could just see where she's at.

2189
02:24:41,210 --> 02:24:43,210
She could actually just come back in here.

2190
02:24:49,730 --> 02:24:57,470
She could just come back in here and we could have a little bit of a shoddy time again.

2191
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:01,250
No!

2192
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:03,370
Are you kidding me?

2193
02:25:07,210 --> 02:25:10,330
I feel like I don't need the solid eye very much.

2194
02:25:11,770 --> 02:25:12,410
Actually...

2195
02:25:12,410 --> 02:25:17,590
I'm stuck!

2196
02:25:17,790 --> 02:25:17,950
I'm stuck!

2197
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:25,980
Please.

2198
02:25:26,300 --> 02:25:26,600
Please.

2199
02:25:27,240 --> 02:25:27,920
Damn it.

2200
02:25:29,100 --> 02:25:30,060
So unlucky.

2201
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:36,840
We're so close.

2202
02:25:41,540 --> 02:25:45,040
I wish I could tell where it's going to explode from.

2203
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:49,240
Okay.

2204
02:25:53,620 --> 02:25:54,700
It's quiet.

2205
02:25:56,460 --> 02:25:57,520
This is the strongest...

2206
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:03,280
Get up, snake!

2207
02:26:03,400 --> 02:26:03,700
Get up!

2208
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:04,880
Snake!

2209
02:26:06,020 --> 02:26:08,280
I really needed to not do that.

2210
02:26:08,860 --> 02:26:09,600
Oh my gosh.

2211
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:23,550
I'm overheating.

2212
02:26:24,090 --> 02:26:24,810
There she goes.

2213
02:26:24,930 --> 02:26:25,110
Okay.

2214
02:26:25,650 --> 02:26:27,610
And she'll do her little calm down thing, right?

2215
02:26:28,530 --> 02:26:28,870
Where is she?

2216
02:26:29,070 --> 02:26:29,390
Oh no.

2217
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:29,850
Oh no.

2218
02:26:30,070 --> 02:26:30,390
Oh no.

2219
02:26:48,430 --> 02:26:48,850
Oopsie.

2220
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:53,150
I wonder if we can try and get her again.

2221
02:27:03,970 --> 02:27:04,670
So close!

2222
02:27:04,730 --> 02:27:05,330
So close!

2223
02:27:11,750 --> 02:27:13,130
Nice shot, Minky.

2224
02:27:13,290 --> 02:27:13,850
Thank you!

2225
02:27:15,750 --> 02:27:16,990
She's so close.

2226
02:27:24,190 --> 02:27:25,210
Yes I am.

2227
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:28,930
Okay.

2228
02:27:30,090 --> 02:27:31,590
I just missed her.

2229
02:27:31,690 --> 02:27:32,030
Barely.

2230
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:34,630
I wonder if I can get her.

2231
02:27:36,430 --> 02:27:37,850
Which one is her though?

2232
02:27:38,590 --> 02:27:39,210
That's the issue.

2233
02:27:41,590 --> 02:27:43,070
Which one is her?

2234
02:27:43,790 --> 02:27:44,770
Is the harder...

2235
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:46,170
Damn it!

2236
02:27:50,390 --> 02:27:51,790
She's raging again.

2237
02:27:51,930 --> 02:27:52,530
Oh my gosh.

2238
02:27:52,650 --> 02:27:54,410
The amount of salt this woman has.

2239
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:56,350
Puts me to sh...

2240
02:28:06,700 --> 02:28:09,600
I really need to watch a speedrun of this fight in particular.

2241
02:28:16,860 --> 02:28:17,780
Just one more!

2242
02:28:18,700 --> 02:28:19,840
Just one more hit!

2243
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:20,460
Where did she go?

2244
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:21,200
Damn it.

2245
02:28:30,980 --> 02:28:33,880
Okay guys, where is the statue?

2246
02:28:37,820 --> 02:28:39,060
Where is the statue?

2247
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:44,420
It's upstairs.

2248
02:28:44,540 --> 02:28:45,060
Go all the way up.

2249
02:28:45,140 --> 02:28:45,380
Okay!

2250
02:28:46,140 --> 02:28:47,060
I'll go all the way up.

2251
02:28:47,540 --> 02:28:48,460
Go to the top of the building.

2252
02:28:48,460 --> 02:28:49,040
Okay!

2253
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,140
I'll go to the top of the building.

2254
02:28:55,280 --> 02:28:56,040
Thank you guys.

2255
02:28:56,180 --> 02:28:56,580
Thank you.

2256
02:28:58,020 --> 02:28:59,060
All the way up in a corner.

2257
02:28:59,280 --> 02:28:59,600
Okay!

2258
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:05,460
Should be able to...at the top of the building, so get ready to run.

2259
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:06,240
Okay.

2260
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:22,450
Sorry that one took so long.

2261
02:29:23,670 --> 02:29:24,830
Hopefully we don't have to do it again.

2262
02:29:24,830 --> 02:29:27,070
Hopefully I can find the statue.

2263
02:29:28,650 --> 02:29:30,630
Hopefully I can find it easy.

2264
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:42,240
Raging.

2265
02:29:42,480 --> 02:29:42,700
Raging.

2266
02:29:52,060 --> 02:29:59,600
I think it's this actress?

2267
02:30:01,460 --> 02:30:03,920
She's like an animal activist now.

2268
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:21,440
I periodically see her on Twitter.

2269
02:30:23,760 --> 02:30:25,200
She hates the eagles.

2270
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:30,340
That's the other team during the Superbowl.

2271
02:30:30,420 --> 02:30:32,900
The birds are picking up my flesh and my soul!

2272
02:30:33,860 --> 02:30:34,580
Okay.

2273
02:30:37,900 --> 02:30:38,980
Oh my gosh.

2274
02:30:41,740 --> 02:30:42,960
I love body suits.

2275
02:30:59,460 --> 02:31:00,680
We're on the second floor, right?

2276
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:11,220
She's so smooth.

2277
02:31:12,070 --> 02:31:13,160
She's like a ballerina.

2278
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:15,700
Did you learn that from Vamp?

2279
02:31:18,880 --> 02:31:20,720
Why has he got his hand up there?

2280
02:31:20,780 --> 02:31:21,680
Does she smell bad?

2281
02:31:22,740 --> 02:31:24,060
She probably just smells like gasoline.

2282
02:31:25,780 --> 02:31:26,400
Alright.

2283
02:31:26,980 --> 02:31:27,820
Alright, run snake.

2284
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:31,220
Snake time to run the...

2285
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:38,080
Oh no!

2286
02:31:39,020 --> 02:31:41,260
Don't threaten me with a good time!

2287
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:43,500
Oh, they put us all the way down at the bottom.

2288
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:44,380
That sucks.

2289
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:49,480
In a corner.

2290
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:50,040
In a corner!

2291
02:31:52,990 --> 02:31:53,510
Easy.

2292
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:54,010
Okay.

2293
02:31:55,170 --> 02:31:56,530
Raging raven doll.

2294
02:32:02,010 --> 02:32:03,410
That scared me.

2295
02:32:03,770 --> 02:32:04,210
Wait a second.

2296
02:32:05,910 --> 02:32:09,550
They switch out the weapon.

2297
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:10,410
It's kind of annoying.

2298
02:32:10,410 --> 02:32:14,910
It was definitely not... It was my pistol before.

2299
02:32:17,010 --> 02:32:17,850
Photo shoot?

2300
02:32:17,970 --> 02:32:18,510
I'll try.

2301
02:32:18,810 --> 02:32:19,550
Did she come up here?

2302
02:32:22,450 --> 02:32:23,270
Where is she?

2303
02:32:24,190 --> 02:32:25,230
Jesus Christ!

2304
02:32:25,430 --> 02:32:25,870
Oh my God!

2305
02:32:26,030 --> 02:32:26,550
She's fast!

2306
02:32:26,890 --> 02:32:27,210
Oh my God!

2307
02:32:27,230 --> 02:32:27,670
She's fast!

2308
02:32:29,890 --> 02:32:30,410
Stop!

2309
02:32:37,740 --> 02:32:38,260
Sayonara!

2310
02:32:53,540 --> 02:32:54,380
Oh shoot.

2311
02:32:55,420 --> 02:32:56,140
Got her.

2312
02:32:59,720 --> 02:33:00,880
I'm so bad at this.

2313
02:33:04,200 --> 02:33:05,160
What the hell?

2314
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:05,780
That hit.

2315
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:08,960
That definitely hit.

2316
02:33:09,500 --> 02:33:12,000
Once it gets closer to time, I'll use the shotty.

2317
02:33:14,220 --> 02:33:14,780
I

2318
02:33:27,380 --> 02:33:28,580
thought she would...

2319
02:33:30,260 --> 02:33:34,580
I just want to get close-ish though, because I don't want to...

2320
02:33:50,980 --> 02:33:52,100
I'm so bad at this.

2321
02:33:52,220 --> 02:33:52,480
Sorry guys.

2322
02:33:56,780 --> 02:33:57,960
She was right there.

2323
02:33:58,300 --> 02:33:59,220
How could you miss?

2324
02:34:00,060 --> 02:34:01,600
She was right in front of you.

2325
02:34:02,060 --> 02:34:02,680
Oh my God!

2326
02:34:02,720 --> 02:34:03,260
He did it again!

2327
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:06,440
I'm just wasting bullets at this point.

2328
02:34:17,720 --> 02:34:20,740
When does the timer start?

2329
02:34:25,740 --> 02:34:27,480
Aim for Booba.

2330
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:31,660
It worked!

2331
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:33,360
Look at you, Micmac!

2332
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:39,660
It only works once.

2333
02:34:42,100 --> 02:34:42,980
Takes a few minutes.

2334
02:34:42,980 --> 02:34:44,240
OK, we'll just keep running around.

2335
02:34:48,610 --> 02:34:51,130
I don't want to get her too low.

2336
02:34:52,330 --> 02:34:53,570
She leaned.

2337
02:34:57,980 --> 02:34:59,920
Here it is!

2338
02:35:06,840 --> 02:35:07,380
Music!

2339
02:35:08,880 --> 02:35:09,960
Songs!

2340
02:35:25,580 --> 02:35:28,060
I forgot about the moans.

2341
02:35:30,460 --> 02:35:32,260
I don't remember...

2342
02:35:32,260 --> 02:35:35,280
Do you guys hear it?

2343
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:38,300
Very sus background.

2344
02:35:39,440 --> 02:35:41,680
I did not remember the moans.

2345
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,960
I guess we'll turn on our music now.

2346
02:36:16,190 --> 02:36:17,990
Are you going to start dancing again?

2347
02:36:18,770 --> 02:36:19,730
Wait, hold on.

2348
02:36:22,230 --> 02:36:24,550
I don't think I have the...

2349
02:36:28,150 --> 02:36:29,950
Guys, I don't have a camera.

2350
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:46,820
It's on the plane.

2351
02:36:47,960 --> 02:36:49,740
I thought I got it though.

2352
02:36:49,860 --> 02:36:51,820
When does it...

2353
02:36:58,760 --> 02:36:59,820
Does Dreben sell it?

2354
02:36:59,860 --> 02:37:00,340
Let's check.

2355
02:37:06,880 --> 02:37:08,040
I don't think so.

2356
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:15,120
That's how you're playing the game with one hand.

2357
02:37:15,260 --> 02:37:16,180
What do you mean?

2358
02:37:21,040 --> 02:37:24,420
Two hands always on the steering wheel.

2359
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:26,880
The camera is on the plane.

2360
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:29,280
I thought I searched the plane though.

2361
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:30,660
Have I just not gotten it?

2362
02:37:32,120 --> 02:37:33,580
We'll get it next time then.

2363
02:37:35,320 --> 02:37:36,120
Sorry guys.

2364
02:37:40,240 --> 02:37:41,540
Oh wait, what am I doing?

2365
02:37:48,690 --> 02:37:49,170
Stop!

2366
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:51,390
Start dancing!

2367
02:37:54,660 --> 02:37:55,260
Urgh!

2368
02:38:07,480 --> 02:38:08,940
Stun grenade launcher.

2369
02:38:10,640 --> 02:38:11,240
There

2370
02:38:14,430 --> 02:38:15,330
she goes!

2371
02:38:17,950 --> 02:38:18,550
Another

2372
02:38:32,010 --> 02:38:32,590
concert.

2373
02:38:33,470 --> 02:38:39,320
Can we get another concert?

2374
02:38:40,380 --> 02:38:41,320
I want to do it.

2375
02:38:43,240 --> 02:38:45,840
Now you guys have seen the funny dance.

2376
02:38:45,840 --> 02:38:46,480
Yay!

2377
02:38:49,500 --> 02:38:49,640
I

2378
02:38:56,860 --> 02:38:58,720
wonder who would be the second person though.

2379
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,540
I already know the dance just from watching it there.

2380
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:12,240
Oh, return to baby.

2381
02:39:14,800 --> 02:39:15,880
Little baby.

2382
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:19,940
Alright, that's three statues down.

2383
02:39:20,300 --> 02:39:22,940
We just need two more.

2384
02:39:25,160 --> 02:39:26,620
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

2385
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:26,980
Oh.

2386
02:39:30,020 --> 02:39:30,900
Everything okay?

2387
02:39:32,960 --> 02:39:34,840
I don't know why windows.

2388
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:38,060
I don't know why windows.

2389
02:39:43,500 --> 02:39:45,160
Nothing popped up on my monitor.

2390
02:39:45,960 --> 02:39:47,980
But I can't see because this is full screen.

2391
02:39:50,140 --> 02:39:50,700
Nice.

2392
02:39:52,020 --> 02:39:52,700
Oh no.

2393
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:54,700
I know it's coming up.

2394
02:39:54,700 --> 02:39:58,960
Guys, while Drebin is giving lore drops, I'm going to go get some water.

2395
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:04,700
Every time Drebin does his lore drops, I got to go get water.

2396
02:40:06,280 --> 02:40:07,340
I'll be right back.

2397
02:40:07,600 --> 02:40:08,660
You listen to him, okay?

2398
02:40:09,140 --> 02:40:10,940
You listen to nice old Drebin, alright?

2399
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:12,980
He's going to tell you all about Raging Raven.

2400
02:40:14,320 --> 02:40:15,580
Something bad happened to her.

2401
02:40:15,980 --> 02:40:17,660
Some birds picked out her flesh.

2402
02:40:17,760 --> 02:40:18,180
I don't know.

2403
02:40:19,820 --> 02:40:20,620
I'll be right back.

2404
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,180
Now that's a collector's item.

2405
02:40:27,740 --> 02:40:28,700
How old was she?

2406
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:30,120
I'd say about twenty.

2407
02:40:30,820 --> 02:40:35,380
But she had years of soldiers' rage hidden away in that youthful body of hers.

2408
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:36,240
Soldiers?

2409
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:39,080
Yeah, the soldiers of Ake.

2410
02:40:39,660 --> 02:40:43,160
A place that hasn't seen peace in a long, long time.

2411
02:40:43,860 --> 02:40:46,060
She was captured by one side or another.

2412
02:40:46,680 --> 02:40:48,640
And kept caged up like an animal.

2413
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:51,460
Along with God knows how many other kids.

2414
02:40:51,920 --> 02:40:53,180
Anonymous violence.

2415
02:40:53,180 --> 02:40:54,340
Exactly.

2416
02:40:55,140 --> 02:40:59,180
It's unknown whether her captors were with the government or the rebels.

2417
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:06,580
In any case, they got their kicks by abusing these helpless little kids day after day after day.

2418
02:41:07,240 --> 02:41:13,060
That constant barrage, that battlefield rage slowly built up inside their bodies.

2419
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:14,820
Their minds.

2420
02:41:15,940 --> 02:41:18,680
The kids tried to keep each other's spirits up.

2421
02:41:19,120 --> 02:41:21,940
Always clinging to the hope that someone would come to their rescue.

2422
02:41:21,940 --> 02:41:24,700
Barely surviving off of scraps of food.

2423
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:27,340
But those soldiers didn't stop.

2424
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:31,160
They called the kids parasites and shit-eating ravens.

2425
02:41:31,860 --> 02:41:32,820
Beat them even harder.

2426
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:36,840
Then one morning, the soldiers just up and left.

2427
02:41:37,540 --> 02:41:40,620
Leaving the surviving kids to be eaten alive by the birds.

2428
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:43,540
Almost like one of those sky burials.

2429
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,920
Okay, I'm back.

2430
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:47,820
One by one, their bodies were picked apart by ravens' feet.

2431
02:41:47,860 --> 02:41:48,260
Oh no!

2432
02:41:48,940 --> 02:41:50,160
Oh, he already started!

2433
02:41:50,980 --> 02:41:51,840
Oh no!

2434
02:41:56,220 --> 02:41:57,440
Oh my god.

2435
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:00,000
Oh my god, welcome back.

2436
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:00,380
Thank you!

2437
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:05,920
I think that was just the cut, the long cutscene after this though, right?

2438
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:07,260
Kinda short.

2439
02:42:07,260 --> 02:42:09,720
She ripped the ravens pecking at her to pieces.

2440
02:42:10,160 --> 02:42:11,420
And then went after the soldiers.

2441
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:17,240
And when she finally caught up with them, she waited until nightfall like a hunter awaiting its prey.

2442
02:42:17,440 --> 02:42:19,960
The upcoming cutscene though is a real treat.

2443
02:42:19,980 --> 02:42:22,280
They say that when a raven cries, a man dies.

2444
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:24,260
No more gameplay.

2445
02:42:26,180 --> 02:42:30,320
Screeching and cawing, she killed every last living being in the camp.

2446
02:42:30,340 --> 02:42:31,080
But I want to get the camera.

2447
02:42:31,440 --> 02:42:33,940
Both the soldiers and the civilians they'd enslaved.

2448
02:42:33,940 --> 02:42:37,980
In her eyes, there was no longer a difference.

2449
02:42:38,760 --> 02:42:41,160
The cruelty her friends had suffered.

2450
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:44,060
The pain and humiliation she'd endured.

2451
02:42:44,980 --> 02:42:50,200
Hers was the distillation of the rage that decades of war had imparted on those soldiers.

2452
02:42:51,460 --> 02:42:55,440
It was her strength and her greatest weakness.

2453
02:42:56,240 --> 02:42:57,380
You're something else, Snake.

2454
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,780
You managed to cleanse Raven of her rage.

2455
02:43:01,540 --> 02:43:02,300
No, seriously.

2456
02:43:02,400 --> 02:43:03,440
It's because my rage is greater.

2457
02:43:03,440 --> 02:43:04,600
You're the seed of war.

2458
02:43:05,440 --> 02:43:08,600
In fact, I'd say you might even be war itself.

2459
02:43:09,280 --> 02:43:10,300
That's so mean, Drebin.

2460
02:43:10,340 --> 02:43:11,600
You don't even know us.

2461
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:13,520
You don't even know him.

2462
02:43:13,520 --> 02:43:15,120
You still got half the B&B Corps ahead of you.

2463
02:43:15,660 --> 02:43:17,620
Keep your eye on the ball, pal.

2464
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:20,720
Such a jerk.

2465
02:43:22,100 --> 02:43:25,520
You know what, I don't know if you can just go up to people and be like, yeah, you're literal war.

2466
02:43:25,980 --> 02:43:27,340
You know what else you are?

2467
02:43:27,820 --> 02:43:28,220
Cancer.

2468
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,020
You're just like the worst things in the world.

2469
02:43:31,020 --> 02:43:34,500
Let me just keep naming off the terrible things that you could be.

2470
02:43:37,320 --> 02:43:38,280
So rude.

2471
02:43:38,900 --> 02:43:43,720
Gosh, we're trying to be the good guy here and you're like, yeah, you're war.

2472
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:49,340
Big Booba Corps?

2473
02:43:49,560 --> 02:43:49,880
No.

2474
02:43:50,700 --> 02:43:51,040
Maybe.

2475
02:43:51,880 --> 02:43:53,980
I don't think all of them have a big booba though.

2476
02:43:54,800 --> 02:43:56,160
Sorry if that disappoints you.

2477
02:43:56,620 --> 02:43:59,060
But there should be a little bit of something for everyone, right?

2478
02:44:04,080 --> 02:44:04,920
Yeah.

2479
02:44:05,380 --> 02:44:06,740
Oh, Big Mama.

2480
02:44:07,240 --> 02:44:08,960
Big Mama, we cleansed her.

2481
02:44:15,650 --> 02:44:16,770
Oh, I can't.

2482
02:44:18,570 --> 02:44:19,030
I can't.

2483
02:44:32,770 --> 02:44:35,510
I managed to get in touch with the children.

2484
02:44:36,170 --> 02:44:37,870
The Pix is safe.

2485
02:44:38,850 --> 02:44:42,190
We're going to rendezvous on the riverbank downstream.

2486
02:44:44,030 --> 02:44:47,170
Land and air routes are cut off.

2487
02:44:48,890 --> 02:44:51,550
But there's a cruiser waiting for us.

2488
02:44:52,330 --> 02:44:55,750
The Volta River is our only chance of escape.

2489
02:44:57,110 --> 02:44:58,650
Let's get out of here.

2490
02:44:59,270 --> 02:44:59,670
Hurry.

2491
02:45:00,810 --> 02:45:01,570
Good thinking.

2492
02:45:01,570 --> 02:45:03,510
The way he's holding her hand.

2493
02:45:04,230 --> 02:45:05,710
Such a gentleman.

2494
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:18,820
Eva, we need you.

2495
02:45:19,260 --> 02:45:22,160
We can't drive this bike.

2496
02:45:22,920 --> 02:45:24,160
We don't know how.

2497
02:45:27,140 --> 02:45:28,340
That's ominous.

2498
02:45:32,720 --> 02:45:33,520
Triumph.

2499
02:45:40,900 --> 02:45:44,200
There's no need to keep lying to myself.

2500
02:45:44,840 --> 02:45:49,140
I only get off my bike when I fall in love.

2501
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:04,620
Why did you let her just be there by herself anyway?

2502
02:46:10,900 --> 02:46:11,880
To the river.

2503
02:46:13,020 --> 02:46:15,900
There should be fewer of them down there.

2504
02:46:25,190 --> 02:46:27,150
Why are they so cute though?

2505
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:28,230
What?

2506
02:46:28,330 --> 02:46:28,950
I'm gonna getcha!

2507
02:46:30,890 --> 02:46:31,930
I'm gonna getcha!

2508
02:46:43,340 --> 02:46:45,700
Cure menu please, thank you.

2509
02:46:55,270 --> 02:46:58,590
Okay, I was gonna say this last time I saved the game.

2510
02:46:58,830 --> 02:47:00,470
Okay guys, I was gonna be...

2511
02:47:01,830 --> 02:47:04,170
I was gonna be a little cheeky, okay?

2512
02:47:05,750 --> 02:47:08,130
Let me show you with my old save files.

2513
02:47:10,630 --> 02:47:11,790
Spoilers a little bit maybe.

2514
02:47:11,790 --> 02:47:12,670
But...

2515
02:47:15,050 --> 02:47:16,730
So, one...

2516
02:47:16,730 --> 02:47:18,110
Oh gosh, lots of spoilers.

2517
02:47:18,410 --> 02:47:19,790
One place to...

2518
02:47:24,030 --> 02:47:24,870
To...

2519
02:47:27,070 --> 02:47:29,170
To grind is...

2520
02:47:30,450 --> 02:47:31,250
Act 5.

2521
02:47:32,250 --> 02:47:35,230
And it's right before a certain room.

2522
02:47:36,890 --> 02:47:39,470
It's right before a certain room.

2523
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:43,070
That you have to crawl through.

2524
02:47:43,730 --> 02:47:47,470
And I was like, oh my gosh, if I just load up my old...

2525
02:47:47,470 --> 02:47:49,310
My old save.

2526
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:53,630
I could go and grind the DP there.

2527
02:47:53,990 --> 02:47:57,070
And then I could get the stuff, right?

2528
02:47:58,750 --> 02:48:02,570
And I think, if I remember correctly, it would transfer over.

2529
02:48:02,690 --> 02:48:06,930
If not, I was just gonna play up until the part and skip a bunch of the stuff.

2530
02:48:07,250 --> 02:48:08,410
But anyway...

2531
02:48:09,750 --> 02:48:10,230
Um...

2532
02:48:11,810 --> 02:48:12,290
And...

2533
02:48:13,130 --> 02:48:13,610
But...

2534
02:48:14,870 --> 02:48:15,350
I...

2535
02:48:16,050 --> 02:48:16,910
Didn't save.

2536
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:20,090
I would've had to go and fight the last boss again.

2537
02:48:20,530 --> 02:48:21,650
Like the, um...

2538
02:48:21,650 --> 02:48:23,330
I would've had to fight, uh...

2539
02:48:23,330 --> 02:48:23,810
What's it called?

2540
02:48:24,970 --> 02:48:26,270
Not Psycho Mantis.

2541
02:48:26,490 --> 02:48:26,970
Again.

2542
02:48:27,470 --> 02:48:28,530
And that would've been...

2543
02:48:29,510 --> 02:48:30,470
I didn't...

2544
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:31,450
I really didn't want to.

2545
02:48:31,650 --> 02:48:35,110
And it's all like having to go through the boat and everything.

2546
02:48:35,470 --> 02:48:36,490
And so I was just like...

2547
02:48:37,810 --> 02:48:40,650
So it was like...

2548
02:48:41,190 --> 02:48:42,730
It was like...

2549
02:48:42,730 --> 02:48:43,990
I said not Psycho Mantis.

2550
02:48:44,030 --> 02:48:45,490
I can't remember what they call her.

2551
02:48:48,410 --> 02:48:49,370
Something Mantis.

2552
02:48:49,490 --> 02:48:50,430
The Beauty Mantis.

2553
02:48:50,490 --> 02:48:51,070
What's her name?

2554
02:48:54,810 --> 02:48:55,770
Screaming Mantis.

2555
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:56,310
Thank you.

2556
02:48:57,470 --> 02:48:58,430
Spoiler Mantis.

2557
02:48:58,530 --> 02:48:58,810
No.

2558
02:48:59,490 --> 02:49:00,370
Screaming Mantis.

2559
02:49:00,410 --> 02:49:01,950
We've already seen her, you guys.

2560
02:49:01,990 --> 02:49:02,750
It's not a spoiler.

2561
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:04,050
We know we have to fight her.

2562
02:49:04,590 --> 02:49:06,030
We know we have to fight her.

2563
02:49:07,250 --> 02:49:08,230
But, um...

2564
02:49:08,230 --> 02:49:09,630
Yeah, so I was like...

2565
02:49:09,630 --> 02:49:10,050
Dang.

2566
02:49:10,470 --> 02:49:12,010
I would've had to fight her again.

2567
02:49:12,310 --> 02:49:13,770
I could've skipped all the cutscenes.

2568
02:49:14,210 --> 02:49:15,450
Just to farm.

2569
02:49:16,690 --> 02:49:17,210
But...

2570
02:49:17,930 --> 02:49:20,030
I think I'm too far gone now.

2571
02:49:21,430 --> 02:49:23,470
I'm too far gone in the game.

2572
02:49:23,630 --> 02:49:24,710
Too far and everything.

2573
02:49:27,650 --> 02:49:28,170
So...

2574
02:49:28,170 --> 02:49:29,930
Some of chat hasn't seen her face yet.

2575
02:49:30,570 --> 02:49:30,810
Yeah?

2576
02:49:31,170 --> 02:49:32,590
I'm not showing you her face.

2577
02:49:33,490 --> 02:49:34,590
This is...

2578
02:49:37,530 --> 02:49:38,250
No?

2579
02:49:40,650 --> 02:49:42,670
What you're assuming is incorrect.

2580
02:49:44,810 --> 02:49:45,530
Yeah.

2581
02:49:46,870 --> 02:49:47,690
But anyway.

2582
02:49:51,870 --> 02:49:52,590
So...

2583
02:49:58,400 --> 02:49:59,740
Who's that cutie?

2584
02:49:59,960 --> 02:50:02,360
Actually, they also already have mentioned her before.

2585
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:04,840
So it's not a spoiler.

2586
02:50:05,100 --> 02:50:05,760
But...

2587
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:07,060
I won't say.

2588
02:50:07,420 --> 02:50:08,220
It is...

2589
02:50:08,220 --> 02:50:10,540
You know, they've already talked about her in the game.

2590
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:11,340
So...

2591
02:50:11,340 --> 02:50:11,920
But it's okay.

2592
02:50:15,850 --> 02:50:17,090
Oh, Big Mama.

2593
02:50:17,550 --> 02:50:18,350
Please, Snake.

2594
02:50:18,490 --> 02:50:20,330
Please, assist her or something.

2595
02:50:21,390 --> 02:50:21,990
Please.

2596
02:50:29,890 --> 02:50:30,570
Oh.

2597
02:50:30,950 --> 02:50:31,630
My.

2598
02:50:32,230 --> 02:50:32,710
Freak.

2599
02:50:34,790 --> 02:50:37,010
Who's my favorite freak over there?

2600
02:50:47,750 --> 02:50:49,270
Not just any liquid.

2601
02:50:50,010 --> 02:50:50,450
Liquid...

2602
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:54,230
Snake,

2603
02:51:14,960 --> 02:51:15,640
put on your glasses.

2604
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:17,460
Can't you read the room, Snake?

2605
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:18,880
Can't you tell by her reaction?

2606
02:51:20,720 --> 02:51:21,440
Is that it?

2607
02:51:23,660 --> 02:51:24,480
Oh.

2608
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:25,700
Old man.

2609
02:51:54,260 --> 02:51:57,060
Old man.

2610
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:04,880
Don't listen to him!

2611
02:52:08,800 --> 02:52:09,360
Snake.

2612
02:52:37,210 --> 02:52:38,330
Come on.

2613
02:52:44,070 --> 02:52:45,310
Oh my gosh, Quinn.

2614
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:46,730
Thank you so much.

2615
02:52:46,730 --> 02:52:48,710
I can't sing happy birthday right now.

2616
02:52:48,930 --> 02:52:50,230
But please remind me later.

2617
02:52:53,970 --> 02:52:54,530
No.

2618
02:52:56,950 --> 02:52:57,510
Ow.

2619
02:52:59,010 --> 02:52:59,550
Why

2620
02:53:05,340 --> 02:53:06,440
are the old men so nimble?

2621
02:53:19,690 --> 02:53:20,670
Don't pull it out.

2622
02:53:24,930 --> 02:53:25,950
Oh my god.

2623
02:53:32,510 --> 02:53:34,630
The military part.

2624
02:53:52,980 --> 02:53:56,760
I don't even have a body and I can sell this part.

2625
02:54:03,480 --> 02:54:05,160
Remember GW?

2626
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:08,420
The AI they think they lost?

2627
02:54:09,940 --> 02:54:11,560
It's mine.

2628
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:13,380
Part of my army.

2629
02:54:16,940 --> 02:54:17,780
Impossible.

2630
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:20,700
We destroyed it.

2631
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:29,780
Your worm only managed to cut GW into little pieces.

2632
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:31,980
Pieces we were able to reconstruct.

2633
02:54:31,980 --> 02:54:33,060
Maybe.

2634
02:54:33,300 --> 02:54:35,920
Then we stowed it away inside JD's network.

2635
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:43,600
This man's body has served me well, allowing me to pass every security barrier between me and GW.

2636
02:54:44,480 --> 02:54:48,440
After all, the Patriot system is nothing more than a machine.

2637
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:55,700
While the GW is a spook inside the network, there's no way JD would recognize it as an external threat.

2638
02:54:55,700 --> 02:55:01,800
Once I destroy JD with a nuclear strike, the Patriot's network will be mine.

2639
02:55:02,520 --> 02:55:08,680
And then I'll build my haven, free from all forms of control.

2640
02:55:09,320 --> 02:55:15,480
I'll cast aside my old identity and take my own name for the first time.

2641
02:55:16,140 --> 02:55:17,400
You could do that now.

2642
02:55:18,740 --> 02:55:20,580
Nothing is stopping you.

2643
02:55:20,960 --> 02:55:23,960
Liquid, you're planning to recreate the Patriots?

2644
02:55:24,900 --> 02:55:28,480
Snake, we were created by the Patriots.

2645
02:55:29,260 --> 02:55:30,500
We're not men.

2646
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:35,420
We're shadows in the shape of men.

2647
02:55:43,440 --> 02:55:46,660
We're freaks who never should have existed.

2648
02:55:51,860 --> 02:55:58,060
We're a system, an insurance that future generations never prosper.

2649
02:56:04,240 --> 02:56:09,880
The Patriots saw fit to create us, and in doing so became our only raison d'etre.

2650
02:56:17,660 --> 02:56:18,420
Snake!

2651
02:56:26,900 --> 02:56:32,140
I think we're all in agreement for the first part.

2652
02:56:46,660 --> 02:56:47,600
We will be reborn.

2653
02:57:00,480 --> 02:57:05,940
If I just... If I just... If I just... If I just...

2654
02:57:05,940 --> 02:57:07,940
My OTP!

2655
02:57:10,820 --> 02:57:12,500
Why did you get that apple?

2656
02:57:13,160 --> 02:57:13,920
Bad apple.

2657
02:57:22,180 --> 02:57:23,700
Recognize it.

2658
02:57:23,820 --> 02:57:25,140
Recognize it!

2659
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:28,860
He hates Spru.

2660
02:57:29,790 --> 02:57:37,940
So long as we both live, the world will not know an age of light.

2661
02:57:38,740 --> 02:57:44,820
If we're to pass the baton to the next generation, the only choice left to us is death.

2662
02:57:55,600 --> 02:57:56,220
Boss.

2663
02:57:58,060 --> 02:57:58,680
Good.

2664
02:57:58,900 --> 02:58:02,820
The players have all assembled.

2665
02:58:04,500 --> 02:58:07,440
The time has come for you to witness.

2666
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:10,900
Witness our moment of triumph.

2667
02:58:13,900 --> 02:58:14,700
Go!

2668
02:58:33,430 --> 02:58:36,090
Stop acting like you're concerned.

2669
02:58:36,910 --> 02:58:37,830
I hate you.

2670
02:58:38,470 --> 02:58:39,630
Drown in the ocean!

2671
02:58:49,760 --> 02:58:52,880
She's like, I'm sorry you're hurting.

2672
02:58:53,060 --> 02:58:54,120
I know I caused it.

2673
02:59:06,850 --> 02:59:07,330
Bright.

2674
02:59:10,130 --> 02:59:13,790
That's what my cats look like when I turn on the kitchen light and they're begging.

2675
02:59:16,990 --> 02:59:18,090
You got this.

2676
02:59:20,070 --> 02:59:23,010
I go bright every time I turn on the light.

2677
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:30,140
Someone push her over.

2678
02:59:30,140 --> 02:59:37,640
Drop your weapons and stand down.

2679
02:59:45,510 --> 02:59:47,770
Yeah, shoot Meryl, please.

2680
02:59:47,930 --> 02:59:49,470
I know, shoot first Meryl.

2681
02:59:50,670 --> 02:59:52,550
Don't even...just shoot him.

2682
02:59:52,650 --> 02:59:54,190
Don't even tell him to stand down.

2683
02:59:54,310 --> 02:59:54,750
Just shoot.

2684
03:00:05,260 --> 03:00:07,640
Raging Raven with her combined hate for Neo.

2685
03:00:08,040 --> 03:00:08,260
True.

2686
03:00:11,160 --> 03:00:12,440
Just shoot him!

2687
03:00:13,080 --> 03:00:14,560
You have all the man power!

2688
03:00:15,460 --> 03:00:16,420
Do it!

2689
03:00:17,500 --> 03:00:18,740
Right now!

2690
03:00:19,380 --> 03:00:21,400
Look how cool he is though.

2691
03:00:30,080 --> 03:00:32,660
I love...I love Ocelot.

2692
03:00:32,780 --> 03:00:33,420
I love Liquid.

2693
03:00:33,500 --> 03:00:34,900
I love Liquid Ocelot.

2694
03:00:48,560 --> 03:00:49,580
Now shoot!

2695
03:00:50,360 --> 03:00:51,120
Shoot!

2696
03:00:54,420 --> 03:00:57,700
This is what the taxpayer's money goes to, right?

2697
03:00:58,400 --> 03:00:59,120
Shoot!

2698
03:01:01,140 --> 03:01:02,800
You got all that ammo!

2699
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:10,320
Do something with it!

2700
03:01:12,060 --> 03:01:14,200
My taxes paid for this!

2701
03:01:18,930 --> 03:01:22,370
I know we're still in Europe, but they have USA boats!

2702
03:01:28,050 --> 03:01:29,490
This cutscene is so long.

2703
03:01:29,510 --> 03:01:30,350
Why didn't they shoot?

2704
03:01:33,390 --> 03:01:35,890
I gotta get a real good look at them.

2705
03:01:35,890 --> 03:01:38,050
Oh my god, Vamp is so dramatic.

2706
03:01:39,330 --> 03:01:42,110
You're not an actual vampire, you dingus.

2707
03:01:44,930 --> 03:01:47,210
We've literally seen you go out in sunlight.

2708
03:01:50,410 --> 03:01:52,030
Stop being so dramatic.

2709
03:01:59,840 --> 03:02:01,120
Discord light mode.

2710
03:02:03,920 --> 03:02:06,720
Well, actually, Discord light mode, yeah.

2711
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,840
I still use Twitter light mode though.

2712
03:02:11,480 --> 03:02:14,480
All of you, drop your weapons and put your hands up!

2713
03:02:21,970 --> 03:02:23,910
It can't be that bright.

2714
03:02:24,710 --> 03:02:25,230
Oh my god.

2715
03:02:25,990 --> 03:02:26,610
Oh my god.

2716
03:02:31,810 --> 03:02:32,370
Yes.

2717
03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:34,310
Yes.

2718
03:02:35,950 --> 03:02:36,690
Oh, big mama.

2719
03:02:37,030 --> 03:02:38,990
Oh, somebody please help her.

2720
03:02:50,880 --> 03:02:53,520
Yeah, it might be bad writing, but you know...

2721
03:02:56,620 --> 03:02:57,580
I don't know.

2722
03:03:00,140 --> 03:03:03,700
I like the payoff, so I'm okay with it.

2723
03:03:03,960 --> 03:03:05,080
It's fun writing.

2724
03:03:05,280 --> 03:03:05,480
Yeah.

2725
03:03:09,080 --> 03:03:11,340
Oh gosh, Snake knows something up.

2726
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:13,580
He's like...

2727
03:03:14,960 --> 03:03:16,400
Yeah, and fire!

2728
03:03:16,620 --> 03:03:17,520
Say fire right now.

2729
03:03:17,660 --> 03:03:18,860
Say fire right now!

2730
03:03:39,300 --> 03:03:41,440
Oh, the light's turned off.

2731
03:04:20,390 --> 03:04:21,570
Yeah, what about Johnny?

2732
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:24,950
We know he's not doing his job.

2733
03:04:26,350 --> 03:04:30,530
We know someone isn't doing their job!

2734
03:04:30,870 --> 03:04:31,930
Excuse me!

2735
03:04:38,170 --> 03:04:39,610
Oh my god.

2736
03:04:40,270 --> 03:04:41,950
This scene is so great.

2737
03:04:46,470 --> 03:04:46,550
Ah!

2738
03:05:02,370 --> 03:05:03,490
Uh-oh.

2739
03:05:04,150 --> 03:05:04,850
Uh-oh!

2740
03:05:17,310 --> 03:05:18,150
Oh

2741
03:05:22,880 --> 03:05:23,720
god!

2742
03:05:25,220 --> 03:05:26,660
That was close.

2743
03:05:28,960 --> 03:05:31,740
I should have jumped out in the water.

2744
03:05:32,260 --> 03:05:33,600
Jump out into the water!

2745
03:05:35,360 --> 03:05:37,360
You can't save it!

2746
03:05:41,580 --> 03:05:42,980
Uh

2747
03:06:03,260 --> 03:06:03,960
-oh.

2748
03:06:05,500 --> 03:06:06,680
Die!

2749
03:06:34,730 --> 03:06:35,490
Bang!

2750
03:06:43,530 --> 03:06:45,370
I'm yes!

2751
03:06:45,370 --> 03:06:45,870
Yes!

2752
03:06:50,150 --> 03:06:51,550
Close,

2753
03:06:54,670 --> 03:06:54,990
Snake.

2754
03:06:55,850 --> 03:07:06,050
For what?

2755
03:07:07,610 --> 03:07:09,990
But why?

2756
03:07:14,570 --> 03:07:15,250
Yeah,

2757
03:08:02,490 --> 03:08:03,970
with her fake sympathy.

2758
03:08:07,610 --> 03:08:09,190
I don't think he sees anything.

2759
03:08:10,510 --> 03:08:16,190
Guards of the Patriots!

2760
03:08:23,220 --> 03:08:27,600
All this bloodshed is on your hands!

2761
03:08:27,600 --> 03:08:28,380
Yes!

2762
03:08:29,700 --> 03:08:30,600
Sorry.

2763
03:08:30,920 --> 03:08:31,580
Sorry.

2764
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:32,760
Sorry.

2765
03:08:33,180 --> 03:08:33,180
Sorry.

2766
03:08:37,540 --> 03:08:38,440
Sorry.

2767
03:08:38,960 --> 03:08:40,900
Got a little heated there.

2768
03:09:08,010 --> 03:09:10,150
Oh, that's not good.

2769
03:09:12,930 --> 03:09:14,750
Oh my god!

2770
03:09:29,950 --> 03:09:31,110
He's sick.

2771
03:09:32,930 --> 03:09:34,310
He's protecting her!

2772
03:09:37,090 --> 03:09:39,710
This is what we mean when we say fire.

2773
03:09:40,030 --> 03:09:41,410
We actually commit.

2774
03:09:42,070 --> 03:09:44,230
We actually do the action.

2775
03:09:47,210 --> 03:09:48,930
You have to be more like Ocelot.

2776
03:09:48,970 --> 03:09:50,830
You have to be not afraid to do the thing.

2777
03:09:53,510 --> 03:09:54,770
Or liquid, I suppose.

2778
03:09:55,530 --> 03:09:56,770
Well, also Ocelot.

2779
03:09:56,770 --> 03:09:58,090
Let them have it.

2780
03:09:58,570 --> 03:10:00,470
We don't need it anymore.

2781
03:10:16,710 --> 03:10:17,990
It hurts!

2782
03:10:18,590 --> 03:10:19,230
You

2783
03:10:26,550 --> 03:10:27,630
didn't have to do that!

2784
03:10:27,770 --> 03:10:29,330
You really did not have to do that.

2785
03:10:33,610 --> 03:10:34,510
Evil boy!

2786
03:10:41,320 --> 03:10:41,960
Snake!

2787
03:10:44,760 --> 03:10:45,360
Ah!

2788
03:10:59,770 --> 03:11:00,370
Stop!

2789
03:11:00,590 --> 03:11:01,830
Please stop showing her face.

2790
03:11:01,890 --> 03:11:04,410
Oh, here it comes.

2791
03:11:50,130 --> 03:11:51,730
It's so quiet now.

2792
03:12:04,060 --> 03:12:06,520
I think lots of guys still survived though.

2793
03:12:06,820 --> 03:12:07,520
Or maybe not.

2794
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:09,520
Maybe lots is a...

2795
03:12:09,520 --> 03:12:10,660
There's survivors?

2796
03:12:34,280 --> 03:12:36,160
Guys, we barely know...oh wait.

2797
03:12:36,520 --> 03:12:37,520
Oh my god.

2798
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:38,960
My heart is not ready.

2799
03:12:39,640 --> 03:12:41,400
My heart is not ready for this!

2800
03:12:56,860 --> 03:12:58,220
He's too high!

2801
03:13:07,900 --> 03:13:10,200
He's too attractive!

2802
03:13:10,440 --> 03:13:11,800
Why did they make him like this?

2803
03:13:12,280 --> 03:13:12,920
Oh my god.

2804
03:13:13,460 --> 03:13:15,060
Even the sensual CPR.

2805
03:13:15,060 --> 03:13:16,040
Please sir!

2806
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:17,380
You have to be more aggressive!

2807
03:13:19,380 --> 03:13:21,060
Don't just take advantage of the moment!

2808
03:13:25,140 --> 03:13:26,840
It's what they say.

2809
03:13:27,760 --> 03:13:30,160
All hot people have IBS.

2810
03:13:31,140 --> 03:13:32,840
Because otherwise...

2811
03:13:32,840 --> 03:13:35,440
Otherwise they would just be too hot.

2812
03:13:35,960 --> 03:13:38,240
And they need a flaw.

2813
03:13:38,240 --> 03:13:38,440
Oh my god.

2814
03:13:48,400 --> 03:13:49,520
On you?

2815
03:13:50,220 --> 03:13:50,560
Sir?

2816
03:13:57,680 --> 03:14:01,840
Yeah, I think maybe you should take off the vest, right?

2817
03:14:05,680 --> 03:14:06,800
Oh, Meryl!

2818
03:14:09,300 --> 03:14:10,600
Poopoo man was sexy.

2819
03:14:10,820 --> 03:14:12,080
Oh, nevermind.

2820
03:14:12,240 --> 03:14:12,620
First one.

2821
03:14:15,560 --> 03:14:16,100
Meryl!

2822
03:14:16,800 --> 03:14:19,120
Is this her first time seeing his face?

2823
03:14:19,480 --> 03:14:20,060
I wonder.

2824
03:14:20,060 --> 03:14:20,200
Alright.

2825
03:14:47,670 --> 03:14:50,650
That tastes like polluted river water.

2826
03:14:50,810 --> 03:14:52,250
I know, it's probably horrible.

2827
03:14:55,030 --> 03:14:56,310
Oh my god.

2828
03:14:56,970 --> 03:14:57,650
The man is...

2829
03:14:59,990 --> 03:15:01,510
The man should be...

2830
03:15:01,510 --> 03:15:03,410
This is like straight out of Final Fantasy!

2831
03:15:03,710 --> 03:15:04,490
I can't!

2832
03:15:07,730 --> 03:15:09,130
Oh my god!

2833
03:15:13,090 --> 03:15:14,230
Okay, can we start?

2834
03:15:14,350 --> 03:15:15,990
Yeah, maybe...

2835
03:15:19,170 --> 03:15:20,130
Oh, snake your face!

2836
03:15:23,970 --> 03:15:25,750
Defeat the hot buff, probably.

2837
03:15:30,990 --> 03:15:36,750
Unless the light is put out, the shadow cannot be erased.

2838
03:15:42,930 --> 03:15:47,350
So long as there is light, there is shadow.

2839
03:15:52,530 --> 03:15:59,470
To return everything to normal, the light must be extinguished.

2840
03:16:51,350 --> 03:16:52,310
Oh my god.

2841
03:16:52,310 --> 03:16:56,550
Almost all traces of MGS3 are gone.

2842
03:16:57,450 --> 03:16:59,150
Oh my monkey!

2843
03:17:00,770 --> 03:17:03,030
Please, time and place, Drebin!

2844
03:17:15,770 --> 03:17:19,550
I would be kind of mad if someone's last words to me were...

2845
03:17:20,010 --> 03:17:21,370
You're also gonna die.

2846
03:17:25,340 --> 03:17:26,840
Okay, shut up monkey!

2847
03:17:27,300 --> 03:17:27,900
Shut up!

2848
03:17:32,660 --> 03:17:33,740
He is dying.

2849
03:17:33,820 --> 03:17:35,580
I know, but I don't want to think about it.

2850
03:17:44,380 --> 03:17:44,940
Man...

2851
03:17:46,280 --> 03:17:47,400
115 kills.

2852
03:17:49,500 --> 03:17:49,980
Oopsie.

2853
03:17:50,460 --> 03:17:51,640
We're at 400!

2854
03:17:55,610 --> 03:17:58,510
Do you guys want to tell me where the...

2855
03:17:58,510 --> 03:17:59,370
Wait a second.

2856
03:18:00,030 --> 03:18:02,190
Yes, we're still on the...

2857
03:18:04,290 --> 03:18:06,230
Yes, we're still on the plane.

2858
03:18:07,030 --> 03:18:08,790
Does anyone want to tell me where the camera is?

2859
03:18:09,070 --> 03:18:14,410
Because one thing I also want to do is that in Shadow Moses you can do spirit photography.

2860
03:18:15,870 --> 03:18:17,210
And I want to do it.

2861
03:18:20,030 --> 03:18:22,010
You enjoy all the killing.

2862
03:18:23,090 --> 03:18:24,330
Kitchen, according to the wiki.

2863
03:18:27,870 --> 03:18:35,870
If Snake used his nano-inhibiting needle to turn off the nano, keeping Big Boss asleep, Boss could have woken up and turned that fighter.

2864
03:18:36,270 --> 03:18:38,310
Oh yeah, he...

2865
03:18:40,130 --> 03:18:44,010
He would have slithered out of there like a slug.

2866
03:18:44,010 --> 03:18:47,130
He would have...

2867
03:18:49,570 --> 03:18:54,650
Everybody would have been so grossed out that they wouldn't be able to do anything.

2868
03:18:54,770 --> 03:18:55,050
Cut!

2869
03:18:55,710 --> 03:18:56,610
Welcome to membership.

2870
03:18:56,890 --> 03:18:57,630
Thank you.

2871
03:19:04,800 --> 03:19:06,280
Reminder for... Yes, yes.

2872
03:19:06,460 --> 03:19:09,060
I was about to say who was...

2873
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,100
Chai Princess, thank you!

2874
03:19:11,240 --> 03:19:12,580
Who was the birthday that I missed?

2875
03:19:14,220 --> 03:19:15,900
Is there anything else?

2876
03:19:15,900 --> 03:19:18,040
Did you ever watch Metal Gear Awesome?

2877
03:19:19,400 --> 03:19:22,500
I did actually a long time ago watch Metal Gear Awesome.

2878
03:19:23,200 --> 03:19:26,900
That was the only way that I knew about Psycho Mantis' fight.

2879
03:19:30,060 --> 03:19:31,200
FAQing monkey.

2880
03:19:31,820 --> 03:19:33,620
Driven has an FAQing monkey.

2881
03:19:36,260 --> 03:19:37,320
Thermal goggles.

2882
03:19:38,700 --> 03:19:42,380
Okay, Quinn!

2883
03:19:43,820 --> 03:19:46,420
Happy birthday, congratu... Wait.

2884
03:19:48,920 --> 03:19:50,320
Am I saying it right?

2885
03:19:50,600 --> 03:19:52,460
I forgot the words of the sentence.

2886
03:19:52,800 --> 03:19:53,480
Hold on!

2887
03:19:58,240 --> 03:19:59,340
Yeah, I was right.

2888
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:00,780
I'm sorry.

2889
03:20:01,300 --> 03:20:04,400
My brain is Big Boss right now.

2890
03:20:04,840 --> 03:20:07,340
Happy birthday, congratulations!

2891
03:20:08,840 --> 03:20:12,140
Happy birthday with salutations!

2892
03:20:12,140 --> 03:20:14,020
Happy birthday!

2893
03:20:14,420 --> 03:20:17,340
May your sky stay blue!

2894
03:20:18,960 --> 03:20:21,560
Happy birthday to you!

2895
03:20:22,040 --> 03:20:23,280
Happy birthday, Quinn!

2896
03:20:24,220 --> 03:20:27,440
Sorry that it took me a delayed moment to sing your happy birthday.

2897
03:20:28,820 --> 03:20:32,320
But I did remember, even without you guys reminding me.

2898
03:20:32,360 --> 03:20:34,320
I was like, I gotta sing happy birthday!

2899
03:20:36,880 --> 03:20:39,700
But sorry this cutscene was like 5 hours long.

2900
03:20:40,840 --> 03:20:41,720
Okay!

2901
03:20:46,020 --> 03:20:47,780
Let's do...

2902
03:20:52,700 --> 03:20:54,460
Let's do...

2903
03:20:58,350 --> 03:20:59,850
The briefing.

2904
03:21:00,210 --> 03:21:01,490
Try and grab the camera.

2905
03:21:02,890 --> 03:21:04,050
In the kitchen.

2906
03:21:04,910 --> 03:21:06,130
I've been in there though.

2907
03:21:11,130 --> 03:21:13,110
It is a great cutscene.

2908
03:21:14,090 --> 03:21:15,230
Oops, I'm moving.

2909
03:21:15,930 --> 03:21:16,830
I love that though.

2910
03:21:17,910 --> 03:21:19,070
I love that though.

2911
03:21:20,370 --> 03:21:21,950
Dunkey's video on MGS lore.

2912
03:21:22,110 --> 03:21:27,310
I've watched quite a few videos on MGS lore so I wouldn't be able to tell you...

2913
03:21:27,310 --> 03:21:28,390
I can't remember.

2914
03:21:30,730 --> 03:21:32,170
But I might have.

2915
03:21:36,240 --> 03:21:38,780
Yesterday I was watching something about Tokimeki Memorial.

2916
03:21:38,780 --> 03:21:42,760
You know, Kojima worked on that game too.

2917
03:21:48,940 --> 03:21:51,600
Oh, that's weird.

2918
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:55,400
I don't know.

2919
03:22:03,140 --> 03:22:07,860
No, she's cooking it that way.

2920
03:22:12,420 --> 03:22:13,440
What could it mean?

2921
03:22:15,380 --> 03:22:16,020
One minute.

2922
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:20,840
Too cute.

2923
03:22:37,910 --> 03:22:39,150
She doesn't know.

2924
03:22:40,150 --> 03:22:44,030
It's her first time meeting someone outside, you know, when you think about it.

2925
03:22:46,010 --> 03:22:48,690
Oh my god, the picture of her and Naomi is up on the wall.

2926
03:22:48,690 --> 03:22:48,770
I don't know.

2927
03:22:58,250 --> 03:22:59,110
Wait a second.

2928
03:22:59,550 --> 03:23:02,690
Can we not get the camera because...

2929
03:23:05,830 --> 03:23:07,510
Because the Mark 2 is here?

2930
03:23:08,590 --> 03:23:09,790
But he makes the Mark 3.

2931
03:23:11,970 --> 03:23:12,490
Rex?

2932
03:23:15,230 --> 03:23:16,950
Like Metal Gear Rex?

2933
03:23:19,530 --> 03:23:21,630
Oh, sorry.

2934
03:23:33,090 --> 03:23:36,690
Are you looking, Otacon?

2935
03:23:48,690 --> 03:23:49,010
What?

2936
03:24:12,230 --> 03:24:14,430
How did nobody notice this?

2937
03:24:14,990 --> 03:24:16,070
I guess the stealth, right?

2938
03:24:23,860 --> 03:24:26,880
The video feed from the Mark 2 cuts off here.

2939
03:24:26,940 --> 03:24:27,820
No, Mark 2!

2940
03:24:28,660 --> 03:24:30,900
Rest in peace.

2941
03:24:46,060 --> 03:24:47,180
Get down!

2942
03:24:52,460 --> 03:24:53,260
I got it.

2943
03:24:56,100 --> 03:24:56,700
Nice.

2944
03:25:12,700 --> 03:25:15,980
She's making noodles.

2945
03:25:37,300 --> 03:25:38,080
Nice.

2946
03:25:39,460 --> 03:25:41,600
Naomi on her way to take credit.

2947
03:25:46,320 --> 03:25:47,100
Nice.

2948
03:25:59,800 --> 03:26:00,920
Excuse me, Sunny.

2949
03:26:10,060 --> 03:26:12,860
Mei Ling!

2950
03:26:29,200 --> 03:26:32,840
It's only a matter of time before we find him.

2951
03:26:46,680 --> 03:26:47,400
Racks.

2952
03:26:49,040 --> 03:26:51,840
Something about racks being ready.

2953
03:26:51,840 --> 03:26:53,100
Shadow Moses.

2954
03:26:57,700 --> 03:26:59,000
You're still here?

2955
03:27:00,440 --> 03:27:01,140
Hello?

2956
03:27:02,360 --> 03:27:03,340
What are you doing?

2957
03:27:03,520 --> 03:27:04,920
I thought you were getting dialysis.

2958
03:27:14,860 --> 03:27:15,880
Shadow Moses.

2959
03:27:22,640 --> 03:27:24,580
How's the White House responding?

2960
03:27:24,880 --> 03:27:26,400
Put your glasses on, man.

2961
03:27:26,400 --> 03:27:27,120
Come on.

2962
03:27:27,740 --> 03:27:28,640
Come on.

2963
03:27:28,940 --> 03:27:30,500
You can't see anything.

2964
03:27:44,220 --> 03:27:45,100
Peace achieved.

2965
03:27:53,400 --> 03:27:55,600
Today is bargain day!

2966
03:28:30,320 --> 03:28:31,720
No,

2967
03:28:40,460 --> 03:28:40,460
Snake.

2968
03:28:44,760 --> 03:28:45,960
No, Snake.

2969
03:28:48,860 --> 03:28:51,680
No, Snake.

2970
03:28:53,400 --> 03:28:58,860
Unless he gains supreme authority, Liquid can't use America's nukes and ballistic missiles.

2971
03:28:59,400 --> 03:29:01,100
So how's he going to launch this strike?

2972
03:29:03,520 --> 03:29:05,000
Good question.

2973
03:29:05,520 --> 03:29:06,160
The U.S.

2974
03:29:06,360 --> 03:29:11,740
converted its nuclear arsenal to reliable replacement warheads two years ago.

2975
03:29:13,480 --> 03:29:14,320
RRWs.

2976
03:29:15,180 --> 03:29:22,260
Yes, the core of the RRWs is now completely ID controlled by the SOP system.

2977
03:29:22,260 --> 03:29:22,620
Sunny!

2978
03:29:26,360 --> 03:29:27,980
Do you guys like the riding camera?

2979
03:29:33,220 --> 03:29:35,040
Can you see him?

2980
03:29:40,480 --> 03:29:42,920
Old Snake's lines are just coughing and hacking.

2981
03:29:46,120 --> 03:29:48,000
Yeah, I'll let you guys see him a bit better.

2982
03:29:54,970 --> 03:29:56,770
That's it.

2983
03:29:57,650 --> 03:29:59,490
He's going to use Rex.

2984
03:30:01,550 --> 03:30:01,770
What?

2985
03:30:02,650 --> 03:30:06,490
Rex was scrapped before the Sons of the Patriot system was implemented.

2986
03:30:08,030 --> 03:30:08,830
Of course.

2987
03:30:10,190 --> 03:30:11,050
A railgun.

2988
03:30:11,270 --> 03:30:12,310
A railgun!

2989
03:30:14,090 --> 03:30:14,990
Indeed.

2990
03:30:16,130 --> 03:30:22,630
Rex's railgun can launch a stealth nuclear warhead into space unconstrained by the system.

2991
03:30:24,110 --> 03:30:31,110
In short, it's the only device they have that is able to launch a nuclear warhead.

2992
03:30:32,310 --> 03:30:34,970
Liquid's going to use it to kill J.D.

2993
03:30:35,190 --> 03:30:38,730
and deliver the coup de grace to the Patriots' reign.

2994
03:30:39,210 --> 03:30:40,670
Coup de grace?

2995
03:30:41,230 --> 03:30:42,410
Where's Rex now?

2996
03:30:43,410 --> 03:30:45,210
I think you know.

2997
03:30:46,590 --> 03:30:49,330
A long forgotten base in U.S.

2998
03:30:49,570 --> 03:30:52,230
territory outside the Patriots' control.

2999
03:30:54,110 --> 03:30:57,030
The place where Liquid made his debut.

3000
03:30:57,650 --> 03:30:58,870
His monument.

3001
03:31:00,010 --> 03:31:03,930
Off the Alaskan coast, in the Fox Archipelago.

3002
03:31:05,250 --> 03:31:07,270
Shadow Moses Island?

3003
03:31:10,010 --> 03:31:12,290
If Liquid destroys J.D.

3004
03:31:12,470 --> 03:31:20,590
and his GW assumes total control over the system, he'll have the world at his fingertips.

3005
03:31:22,350 --> 03:31:26,310
And no one will be able to stop him.

3006
03:31:27,090 --> 03:31:29,890
Not even the Patriots.

3007
03:31:33,250 --> 03:31:37,250
You are the only ones who can save us now.

3008
03:31:40,250 --> 03:31:42,850
Snake, I'm counting on you.

3009
03:31:43,650 --> 03:31:46,670
Defeat Liquid and put an end to his insurrection.

3010
03:31:46,670 --> 03:31:50,810
Everyone else is trying to stop Snake from doing anything except Colonel.

3011
03:31:53,010 --> 03:31:56,590
Everyone's trying to be like, Snake, I don't think you're really up for this.

3012
03:32:14,480 --> 03:32:16,360
Enough is enough, Snake.

3013
03:32:16,360 --> 03:32:19,300
You can't take any more of this.

3014
03:32:20,420 --> 03:32:21,940
I'm not dead yet.

3015
03:32:22,160 --> 03:32:23,500
That's not what I mean.

3016
03:32:23,700 --> 03:32:25,460
You can't beat Liquid.

3017
03:32:27,920 --> 03:32:31,340
He's got the Patriots' own control system on his side.

3018
03:32:33,380 --> 03:32:36,600
Not only are weapons useless, but the U.S.

3019
03:32:36,740 --> 03:32:38,020
military is in shambles.

3020
03:32:38,720 --> 03:32:42,900
And even if it weren't, Liquid's got enough men and machines to match it.

3021
03:32:50,660 --> 03:32:52,600
Things can't get any worse.

3022
03:32:55,900 --> 03:32:57,200
Face it, Snake.

3023
03:32:58,760 --> 03:33:00,020
We've lost.

3024
03:33:05,380 --> 03:33:06,160
Otacon...

3025
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:08,260
We never stood a chance.

3026
03:33:13,920 --> 03:33:16,340
It's not about winning or losing.

3027
03:33:16,340 --> 03:33:23,600
We started this.

3028
03:33:29,970 --> 03:33:35,750
And it's our duty to finish it.

3029
03:33:44,170 --> 03:33:45,150
Sunny...

3030
03:33:45,150 --> 03:33:45,430
No!

3031
03:33:46,030 --> 03:33:47,230
Jack can't go.

3032
03:33:47,690 --> 03:33:49,370
He's not ready yet.

3033
03:33:49,830 --> 03:33:51,130
He needs to rest.

3034
03:33:51,130 --> 03:33:53,710
Let me go, Sunny.

3035
03:34:00,110 --> 03:34:03,210
Your dialysis isn't done yet.

3036
03:34:04,370 --> 03:34:05,190
Snake...

3037
03:34:05,190 --> 03:34:07,510
He's not ready yet.

3038
03:34:07,530 --> 03:34:09,990
The flapping of his bandage gets me every time.

3039
03:34:10,310 --> 03:34:12,630
So haphazardly put on there.

3040
03:34:18,330 --> 03:34:19,990
I'll be fine.

3041
03:34:21,450 --> 03:34:22,090
No!

3042
03:34:23,350 --> 03:34:23,990
No!

3043
03:34:44,250 --> 03:34:47,710
This is so much to put on a little girl.

3044
03:34:54,170 --> 03:34:56,110
I can't even get up.

3045
03:35:02,890 --> 03:35:03,790
What else is will?

3046
03:35:04,970 --> 03:35:06,110
I'm a shadow.

3047
03:35:06,690 --> 03:35:09,170
One that no light will shine on.

3048
03:35:10,190 --> 03:35:14,950
As long as you follow me, you'll never see the day.

3049
03:35:16,010 --> 03:35:16,750
No, Snake!

3050
03:35:17,370 --> 03:35:19,010
You just put that on you.

3051
03:35:19,150 --> 03:35:21,050
That's what everyone else tells you.

3052
03:35:22,350 --> 03:35:23,310
No!

3053
03:35:23,470 --> 03:35:24,430
You

3054
03:35:30,220 --> 03:35:41,500
are both just pawns in this proxy war.

3055
03:35:42,680 --> 03:35:48,480
But once this is over, we will have our freedom.

3056
03:35:49,240 --> 03:35:49,660
Run.

3057
03:35:52,660 --> 03:35:53,960
I'll release you.

3058
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:58,320
It's the only way I'll ever be free.

3059
03:36:00,340 --> 03:36:01,020
Raiden...

3060
03:36:01,020 --> 03:36:03,160
Five years ago...

3061
03:36:03,160 --> 03:36:04,980
That's not what I meant.

3062
03:36:05,940 --> 03:36:08,120
I've got nothing to lose.

3063
03:36:12,100 --> 03:36:13,380
Don't be an idiot.

3064
03:36:14,640 --> 03:36:17,200
You know you've got someone to protect.

3065
03:36:17,380 --> 03:36:20,320
Yeah, dummy dumb bozo stupid head.

3066
03:36:21,560 --> 03:36:24,060
It was never going to work out for me.

3067
03:36:24,060 --> 03:36:27,700
It even rained the day I was born.

3068
03:36:27,940 --> 03:36:29,060
You've got it all wrong.

3069
03:36:30,120 --> 03:36:31,800
You were the lightning in that rain.

3070
03:36:32,660 --> 03:36:35,300
You can still shine through the darkness.

3071
03:36:37,840 --> 03:36:38,640
The lightning.

3072
03:36:43,500 --> 03:36:44,180
Raiden...

3073
03:36:44,180 --> 03:36:45,600
Look at me.

3074
03:36:54,060 --> 03:36:55,460
I can't with him.

3075
03:37:01,260 --> 03:37:02,600
Poor Sunny.

3076
03:37:02,980 --> 03:37:04,220
This poor girl.

3077
03:37:09,690 --> 03:37:10,610
Do you see this?

3078
03:37:11,130 --> 03:37:13,490
Do you want this to happen to your Bishounen face?

3079
03:37:15,530 --> 03:37:17,390
I have no future.

3080
03:37:19,410 --> 03:37:24,410
In a few months, I'm going to be a weapon of mass destruction.

3081
03:37:28,450 --> 03:37:29,170
You...

3082
03:37:31,850 --> 03:37:33,290
You have a family.

3083
03:37:34,290 --> 03:37:37,630
I have no family.

3084
03:37:39,850 --> 03:37:44,640
I have nothing.

3085
03:37:58,720 --> 03:38:01,040
Always been alone.

3086
03:38:04,860 --> 03:38:05,420
Always.

3087
03:38:12,150 --> 03:38:14,850
Okay, you keep telling yourself that, buddy.

3088
03:38:18,470 --> 03:38:19,110
Baby.

3089
03:38:20,150 --> 03:38:22,230
Oh, sweet girl.

3090
03:38:26,610 --> 03:38:29,350
Yeah, he is just so pathetic, isn't he?

3091
03:38:35,580 --> 03:38:36,960
Shut up!

3092
03:38:37,280 --> 03:38:38,060
Shut up!

3093
03:38:38,520 --> 03:38:39,740
She is right there!

3094
03:38:42,160 --> 03:38:43,820
You're so horrible.

3095
03:38:51,820 --> 03:38:53,680
This is my fight.

3096
03:38:55,640 --> 03:38:56,720
My destiny.

3097
03:39:02,480 --> 03:39:03,380
Good night, little baby.

3098
03:39:07,060 --> 03:39:10,640
How is she going to lift this grown-ass man?

3099
03:39:11,240 --> 03:39:12,880
To get him back into bed.

3100
03:39:18,300 --> 03:39:19,900
I understand, Raiden.

3101
03:39:20,100 --> 03:39:21,560
Vin does this to us all the time.

3102
03:39:21,660 --> 03:39:22,020
What are you...

3103
03:39:23,080 --> 03:39:23,620
Mayling!

3104
03:39:28,660 --> 03:39:30,260
I got the results back.

3105
03:39:30,520 --> 03:39:31,180
It's official.

3106
03:39:31,180 --> 03:39:33,320
He's on Shadow Moses Island.

3107
03:39:34,300 --> 03:39:40,000
We lost Metal Gear Mark 2's signal along the way, but the ship is headed in the direction of Shadow Moses.

3108
03:39:40,860 --> 03:39:44,700
This is a picture of the island taken by a civilian imagery satellite.

3109
03:39:48,120 --> 03:39:50,540
The sea line is rising due to global warming.

3110
03:39:51,240 --> 03:39:54,780
Have you heard that the entire Fox Archipelago is about to slip into the ocean?

3111
03:39:55,340 --> 03:39:57,620
The surrounding islands have already been evacuated.

3112
03:39:57,620 --> 03:39:58,500
Oh my god!

3113
03:40:00,720 --> 03:40:03,440
Liquid's arrival there can only mean one thing.

3114
03:40:05,080 --> 03:40:07,120
He is going to use Rex.

3115
03:40:07,440 --> 03:40:08,940
That's how it looks from here.

3116
03:40:09,920 --> 03:40:13,280
All the Metal Gears after Rex were embedded with system IDs.

3117
03:40:13,920 --> 03:40:15,820
I guess it's a good thing they put...

3118
03:40:15,820 --> 03:40:16,640
Shadow Moses...

3119
03:40:17,940 --> 03:40:22,300
I guess it's a good thing they put the place on the highest island.

3120
03:40:23,540 --> 03:40:25,520
That was nine years ago.

3121
03:40:26,280 --> 03:40:27,760
In nine years they flooded?

3122
03:40:28,100 --> 03:40:28,700
Oh my god.

3123
03:40:33,380 --> 03:40:36,800
I think that's pretty severe.

3124
03:40:44,280 --> 03:40:47,620
How did he get back on the bed?

3125
03:40:55,900 --> 03:40:57,340
A forsaken island.

3126
03:40:58,220 --> 03:40:59,020
A haven.

3127
03:41:00,920 --> 03:41:01,840
I love that word.

3128
03:41:02,020 --> 03:41:02,240
Haven.

3129
03:41:02,260 --> 03:41:04,340
I'd say it's more like a forgotten island.

3130
03:41:08,080 --> 03:41:09,500
And it's sinking too.

3131
03:41:13,490 --> 03:41:15,670
Little Rex almost went to the bottom of the sea.

3132
03:41:15,670 --> 03:41:16,670
I thought I'd never go back.

3133
03:41:21,610 --> 03:41:23,330
It'll take me a while to get there.

3134
03:41:23,630 --> 03:41:25,710
But I'll be backing you up from aboard the Missouri.

3135
03:41:26,530 --> 03:41:29,170
She's the only ship in the fleet still able to move.

3136
03:41:29,250 --> 03:41:30,150
She's so cute.

3137
03:41:30,350 --> 03:41:32,870
Since it was decommissioned before the system was put in place.

3138
03:41:33,910 --> 03:41:35,430
And Hawaii's not that far away.

3139
03:41:37,110 --> 03:41:40,110
Otacon, you're not wearing your glasses anymore.

3140
03:41:42,930 --> 03:41:44,710
I switched to contacts.

3141
03:41:46,070 --> 03:41:47,950
We rendezvous at Shadow Moses.

3142
03:41:56,900 --> 03:41:57,240
Look at her.

3143
03:41:57,240 --> 03:41:59,020
The one who submits to heaven shall live.

3144
03:41:59,400 --> 03:42:01,340
He who defies heaven shall perish.

3145
03:42:03,940 --> 03:42:05,360
She's too cute.

3146
03:42:07,360 --> 03:42:10,220
I have to atone for my past too.

3147
03:42:17,180 --> 03:42:21,120
Rex is a beast born from my research.

3148
03:42:24,530 --> 03:42:25,550
Let's go.

3149
03:42:29,030 --> 03:42:31,010
Shadow Moses awaits.

3150
03:42:31,010 --> 03:42:33,190
Shadow Moses awaits.

3151
03:42:36,170 --> 03:42:36,770
Yay,

3152
03:42:49,370 --> 03:42:49,930
okay.

3153
03:42:54,010 --> 03:42:59,170
I think...

3154
03:42:59,170 --> 03:43:00,450
I think I stopped.

3155
03:43:00,710 --> 03:43:03,790
Well, yes, I'm obviously stopping here because we're into Act 4.

3156
03:43:04,570 --> 03:43:05,850
Is the food cold?

3157
03:43:05,950 --> 03:43:06,630
What food?

3158
03:43:07,310 --> 03:43:09,230
Oh no, the noodles, right?

3159
03:43:10,370 --> 03:43:12,550
But I think if I go any further...

3160
03:43:12,550 --> 03:43:16,950
I don't want to spoil the beginning of the...

3161
03:43:17,810 --> 03:43:21,650
Of the beginning of the act since it's pretty cool.

3162
03:43:22,210 --> 03:43:23,070
Peek next week.

3163
03:43:23,190 --> 03:43:23,870
I know!

3164
03:43:24,730 --> 03:43:26,550
Next week is...

3165
03:43:29,250 --> 03:43:30,190
Next week is...

3166
03:43:30,190 --> 03:43:32,630
Next week, there's so...

3167
03:43:32,630 --> 03:43:36,270
Oh my gosh, next week there's so much good stuff.

3168
03:43:37,250 --> 03:43:38,070
So much!

3169
03:43:40,310 --> 03:43:43,490
Act 4 is so, so good.

3170
03:43:43,630 --> 03:43:45,470
It's just absolute fan service.

3171
03:43:45,610 --> 03:43:46,190
It's the best.

3172
03:43:46,310 --> 03:43:46,830
I love it.

3173
03:43:50,650 --> 03:43:54,170
No Russian Twanting is the week after.

3174
03:43:55,370 --> 03:43:56,170
But, you know.

3175
03:43:58,150 --> 03:44:00,160
You know, there's only five acts so...

3176
03:44:01,490 --> 03:44:02,650
We're gonna...

3177
03:44:02,650 --> 03:44:05,340
We only got two more to get through the game and...

3178
03:44:06,780 --> 03:44:08,360
No, I can't.

3179
03:44:08,420 --> 03:44:09,940
I'm not ready for Act 5.

3180
03:44:15,550 --> 03:44:18,690
Despite already knowing Big Mama's lower dump always blows my mind.

3181
03:44:19,750 --> 03:44:20,730
I know, right?

3182
03:44:25,310 --> 03:44:27,550
I'm already crying thinking about it.

3183
03:44:28,830 --> 03:44:30,030
I'm thinking about...

3184
03:44:30,030 --> 03:44:32,030
The end of the game is just so...

3185
03:44:32,770 --> 03:44:36,110
Really, honestly, the last two acts is just so...

3186
03:44:36,790 --> 03:44:38,050
Oh my gosh, they get me hard.

3187
03:44:38,050 --> 03:44:39,230
No, wait, sorry.

3188
03:44:39,590 --> 03:44:42,970
No, what I mean is like...

3189
03:44:42,970 --> 03:44:44,490
They get me in the feels.

3190
03:44:45,630 --> 03:44:46,050
Get

3191
03:44:49,720 --> 03:44:51,440
me in the feels hard is what I...

3192
03:45:06,080 --> 03:45:08,720
I didn't mean to say it like that, please.

3193
03:45:12,200 --> 03:45:13,740
Don't say heart boner.

3194
03:45:18,140 --> 03:45:20,520
For no reason at all, could I trouble you for a new...

3195
03:45:20,520 --> 03:45:21,120
Oh my gosh.

3196
03:45:21,280 --> 03:45:24,640
People have already been asking me about a new NSFW tag.

3197
03:45:29,740 --> 03:45:30,860
I didn't...

3198
03:45:30,860 --> 03:45:33,340
I don't really check it.

3199
03:45:33,800 --> 03:45:35,220
And like I checked it...

3200
03:45:35,220 --> 03:45:38,080
Because someone recently actually and I was just like, oh wow.

3201
03:45:38,340 --> 03:45:40,100
There's no post in here at all.

3202
03:45:40,240 --> 03:45:41,580
I guess people don't use it.

3203
03:45:43,960 --> 03:45:47,880
It turns out that it was...

3204
03:45:49,560 --> 03:45:50,120
That...

3205
03:45:50,120 --> 03:45:52,180
I thought it was hashtag only phantom.

3206
03:45:52,460 --> 03:45:53,900
Yeah, apparently it's...

3207
03:45:54,720 --> 03:45:57,800
It's been like overrun by bots and stuff.

3208
03:45:57,900 --> 03:46:00,100
So, I have to change it.

3209
03:46:00,880 --> 03:46:01,780
I suppose.

3210
03:46:03,040 --> 03:46:07,160
Have it so that people stop posting as racy things in my...

3211
03:46:08,680 --> 03:46:11,800
In my regular art tag.

3212
03:46:14,620 --> 03:46:17,300
I'm like, MGSFameeto takes it to the next level.

3213
03:46:17,820 --> 03:46:23,100
Yeah, the patriots definitely got to the tag.

3214
03:46:23,220 --> 03:46:23,880
It's like...

3215
03:46:23,880 --> 03:46:24,940
I turned...

3216
03:46:24,940 --> 03:46:25,500
I didn't...

3217
03:46:25,500 --> 03:46:29,320
I had a hide sensitive content on on accident on Twitter.

3218
03:46:29,780 --> 03:46:32,260
And as soon as I turned it off and went to go check if it worked.

3219
03:46:32,540 --> 03:46:33,020
I was...

3220
03:46:33,020 --> 03:46:34,520
I wish I hadn't seen...

3221
03:46:34,520 --> 03:46:35,780
I wish I hadn't done that.

3222
03:46:35,840 --> 03:46:36,620
Because it was...

3223
03:46:36,620 --> 03:46:43,740
I saw so many things of IRL people that I truly wished I had never witnessed.

3224
03:46:45,060 --> 03:46:46,880
I was like, oh my god.

3225
03:46:47,260 --> 03:46:48,480
Oh my god.

3226
03:46:50,580 --> 03:46:54,500
So, I'll make a new one eventually.

3227
03:46:54,860 --> 03:46:55,320
Or something.

3228
03:46:55,420 --> 03:46:55,820
I don't know.

3229
03:46:55,880 --> 03:46:57,960
It's not on the top of my priority list.

3230
03:46:58,420 --> 03:46:59,000
I suppose.

3231
03:47:06,500 --> 03:47:07,660
Hold on.

3232
03:47:07,720 --> 03:47:09,740
I'm going to see if...

3233
03:47:10,480 --> 03:47:13,200
I'm going to hide the thing real quick.

3234
03:47:13,840 --> 03:47:16,400
Okay, I got the Lunar Knights main theme.

3235
03:47:16,400 --> 03:47:18,320
Okay, those are the two things we picked up.

3236
03:47:18,400 --> 03:47:18,580
Oh!

3237
03:47:19,040 --> 03:47:19,940
Wait, save the game.

3238
03:47:20,640 --> 03:47:21,240
Wait, hold on.

3239
03:47:21,600 --> 03:47:22,460
Okay, we can do this.

3240
03:47:26,420 --> 03:47:27,520
We can save.

3241
03:47:28,300 --> 03:47:28,920
Let's save.

3242
03:47:33,930 --> 03:47:34,330
Okay.

3243
03:47:34,730 --> 03:47:36,470
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

3244
03:47:36,710 --> 03:47:37,130
Oh, sorry.

3245
03:47:37,270 --> 03:47:38,150
I'm closing out again.

3246
03:47:38,210 --> 03:47:38,430
Sorry.

3247
03:47:39,250 --> 03:47:40,190
Oh yeah, because it's loading.

3248
03:47:40,670 --> 03:47:44,550
And I'm going to go back to the main menu.

3249
03:47:53,070 --> 03:47:55,090
If capture goes weird, then we hide.

3250
03:47:57,570 --> 03:47:58,090
It's...

3251
03:47:58,090 --> 03:47:58,610
Yes.

3252
03:47:58,750 --> 03:47:59,830
Okay, I'm glad that I hid.

3253
03:48:01,930 --> 03:48:02,610
Oh, wait.

3254
03:48:02,730 --> 03:48:03,030
Back.

3255
03:48:05,630 --> 03:48:06,330
Oh, wait.

3256
03:48:08,830 --> 03:48:10,030
Oh my gosh.

3257
03:48:10,090 --> 03:48:11,290
I can't go to the main menu.

3258
03:48:18,750 --> 03:48:19,730
Quit game.

3259
03:48:20,490 --> 03:48:21,010
Yes.

3260
03:48:23,150 --> 03:48:24,190
And then...

3261
03:48:26,930 --> 03:48:27,950
And then...

3262
03:48:28,290 --> 03:48:28,870
I know.

3263
03:48:28,990 --> 03:48:31,290
I remember last time I played this.

3264
03:48:32,050 --> 03:48:35,070
When I was just like, oh my gosh, we're going back to Shadow Moses.

3265
03:48:36,410 --> 03:48:37,090
I...

3266
03:48:38,350 --> 03:48:39,690
I was like...

3267
03:48:40,410 --> 03:48:41,090
I...

3268
03:48:41,090 --> 03:48:41,830
Waiting until...

3269
03:48:42,870 --> 03:48:44,910
Sorry, it's loading the game back up.

3270
03:48:45,250 --> 03:48:45,850
Waiting until...

3271
03:48:47,230 --> 03:48:50,390
The week after was absolute torture.

3272
03:48:51,030 --> 03:48:52,010
I was like...

3273
03:48:52,010 --> 03:48:52,890
I need...

3274
03:48:52,890 --> 03:48:53,870
I...

3275
03:48:53,870 --> 03:48:54,970
I need...

3276
03:48:54,970 --> 03:48:57,790
I need to play this!

3277
03:48:58,170 --> 03:48:58,710
I was...

3278
03:48:58,710 --> 03:48:59,490
Oh my gosh.

3279
03:49:01,610 --> 03:49:04,930
Watching you play this game made it seem like it was made for you specifically.

3280
03:49:05,810 --> 03:49:06,750
I think...

3281
03:49:06,750 --> 03:49:08,450
I think I...

3282
03:49:08,970 --> 03:49:12,110
I think I've warped my brain into...

3283
03:49:12,110 --> 03:49:15,850
Into Metal Gear, so...

3284
03:49:17,450 --> 03:49:18,570
Maybe I...

3285
03:49:19,530 --> 03:49:23,130
Maybe not made for me specifically, but you know, it's like a...

3286
03:49:23,970 --> 03:49:25,130
It's like a...

3287
03:49:25,710 --> 03:49:26,170
How do I...

3288
03:49:26,170 --> 03:49:27,410
I don't know how to describe it.

3289
03:49:27,550 --> 03:49:30,130
Like, I was molded into what this game...

3290
03:49:31,270 --> 03:49:33,230
Into what this game...

3291
03:49:33,790 --> 03:49:34,250
Is.

3292
03:49:34,370 --> 03:49:34,890
You know what I mean?

3293
03:49:36,130 --> 03:49:37,300
Maybe that's a good way to...

3294
03:49:39,390 --> 03:49:40,470
To phrase it.

3295
03:49:41,510 --> 03:49:41,850
Okay.

3296
03:49:43,910 --> 03:49:47,350
Well, thank you guys for more Metal Gear today!

3297
03:49:48,190 --> 03:49:50,010
We got the third statue.

3298
03:49:50,350 --> 03:49:51,290
And we got the camera.

3299
03:49:51,290 --> 03:49:52,290
So next fight...

3300
03:49:52,950 --> 03:49:55,450
We'll definitely be able to take some hot lady pictures.

3301
03:49:56,690 --> 03:49:58,610
And we'll do some spirit photography.

3302
03:49:59,650 --> 03:50:00,210
I...

3303
03:50:01,050 --> 03:50:03,610
I'm gonna have to try and remember...

3304
03:50:03,610 --> 03:50:06,530
Where they are, because there's a lot of them.

3305
03:50:07,590 --> 03:50:09,870
I probably won't get all of them.

3306
03:50:10,290 --> 03:50:12,570
I might enlist some help...

3307
03:50:12,570 --> 03:50:13,750
From you guys.

3308
03:50:14,590 --> 03:50:15,410
But we'll see.

3309
03:50:17,790 --> 03:50:19,550
I'm gonna go watch the video again.

3310
03:50:23,690 --> 03:50:25,530
I invented a tongue twister.

3311
03:50:26,090 --> 03:50:27,330
I really wanted you to try.

3312
03:50:31,250 --> 03:50:31,550
Say...

3313
03:50:31,850 --> 03:50:33,230
I love you, Jolly.

3314
03:50:33,550 --> 03:50:34,690
I love you...

3315
03:50:34,690 --> 03:50:35,370
I love...

3316
03:50:35,370 --> 03:50:36,410
I love you, Jolly.

3317
03:50:36,490 --> 03:50:37,350
I love you...

3318
03:50:37,350 --> 03:50:38,350
I love...

3319
03:50:38,350 --> 03:50:39,490
I love you, Jolly...

3320
03:50:39,910 --> 03:50:40,350
Johnny.

3321
03:50:40,910 --> 03:50:43,330
I love...

3322
03:50:46,820 --> 03:50:48,240
I love you, Jolly.

3323
03:50:48,340 --> 03:50:49,220
I love you, Jolly.

3324
03:50:49,240 --> 03:50:50,640
I can't do it.

3325
03:50:52,700 --> 03:50:53,220
I...

3326
03:50:53,220 --> 03:50:53,640
I...

3327
03:50:54,180 --> 03:50:55,240
I love you, Jolly.

3328
03:50:55,380 --> 03:50:56,460
I love you, Jolly.

3329
03:50:56,600 --> 03:50:57,420
I love you, Jolly.

3330
03:50:59,500 --> 03:51:00,880
You adopted MGS.

3331
03:51:01,020 --> 03:51:02,060
I was born into MGS.

3332
03:51:02,220 --> 03:51:03,820
Molded by...

3333
03:51:03,820 --> 03:51:04,800
Johnny.

3334
03:51:05,780 --> 03:51:06,300
Johnny.

3335
03:51:15,570 --> 03:51:17,370
The Merrell tongue twister.

3336
03:51:22,790 --> 03:51:24,110
What do you mean it worked?

3337
03:51:24,670 --> 03:51:25,950
You're trying to...

3338
03:51:25,950 --> 03:51:27,170
Get me to sound stupid?

3339
03:51:28,670 --> 03:51:30,050
I love you...

3340
03:51:30,050 --> 03:51:32,090
Is I love you.

3341
03:51:32,390 --> 03:51:34,150
I love you.

3342
03:51:34,750 --> 03:51:36,590
Oh, I guess I kind of hear it.

3343
03:51:36,930 --> 03:51:38,010
I love you.

3344
03:51:38,490 --> 03:51:39,450
I love you.

3345
03:51:39,910 --> 03:51:41,290
I love you.

3346
03:51:41,830 --> 03:51:42,670
I have to pronounce...

3347
03:51:42,670 --> 03:51:43,390
Or enunciate more.

3348
03:51:43,710 --> 03:51:44,870
I love you.

3349
03:51:45,650 --> 03:51:46,750
I love you.

3350
03:52:03,080 --> 03:52:05,620
You guys are so...

3351
03:52:07,140 --> 03:52:08,400
You guys...

3352
03:52:10,260 --> 03:52:11,520
You guys...

3353
03:52:12,680 --> 03:52:14,240
Konami flashbang.

3354
03:52:17,020 --> 03:52:18,860
Bless your heart, Minto.

3355
03:52:19,900 --> 03:52:21,140
I have no heart.

3356
03:52:44,450 --> 03:52:45,390
Otsumito everybody!

3357
03:52:47,230 --> 03:52:49,370
Thank you for Act 3!

3358
03:52:50,850 --> 03:52:53,530
And we'll do Act 4 next week!

3359
03:52:53,850 --> 03:52:54,410
Otsumito!

3360
03:52:54,670 --> 03:52:55,190
Thank you everybody!

3361
03:52:55,430 --> 03:52:56,750
Have a good night!

3362
03:52:57,710 --> 03:52:58,470
Bye bye!

3363
03:53:11,110 --> 03:53:12,450
You can still hear me.

3364
03:53:12,550 --> 03:53:13,130
Oh my gosh.

3365
03:53:19,640 --> 03:53:20,560
Later boss.

3366
03:53:20,920 --> 03:53:21,220
Later!

3367
03:53:27,470 --> 03:53:28,530
See you when I see you.

3368
03:54:02,670 --> 03:54:04,350
Did I go sideways for a second?

3369
03:54:05,970 --> 03:54:07,550
Did I go sideways for a second?

3370
03:54:08,970 --> 03:54:11,530
I have to turn off my PS3.

3371
03:54:13,550 --> 03:54:15,910
These are the behind the scenes that I do after the stream.

3372
03:54:54,220 --> 03:54:54,940
You're still here?

3373
03:54:59,460 --> 03:55:00,700
I'm closing out the stream.

3374
03:55:02,840 --> 03:55:03,360
This is it?

3375
03:55:21,050 --> 03:55:22,650
Oh shoot, I let the song repeat.

3376
03:55:26,170 --> 03:55:27,650
I got a DM.

3377
03:55:32,150 --> 03:55:32,910
What's happening?
