1
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,030
That girl!

2
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,210
Where's she been?

3
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,530
That girl!

4
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,670
Where'd

5
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,410
that ghost been?

6
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,140
Where'd that ghost been?

7
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,500
Mickey?

8
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,020
I have not heard that name in so long.

9
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,260
Come on!

10
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:20,980
Mickey?

11
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,880
Do you know a minky?

12
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,620
Do you?

13
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,020
Do you know a minky?

14
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,520
Minky everywhere!

15
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,660
Except here, apparently.

16
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:46,140
Sometimes I can still hear her voice.

17
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,200
Yeah, I almost forgot who I was.

18
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,140
Minky?

19
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Does not ring a bell.

20
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,420
Dang it.

21
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,940
Anyway...

22
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,880
Okaerinasai-mase!

23
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,060
Goshujin-sama!

24
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:05,700
Oji-sama!

25
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,960
Back, baby!

26
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm back, baby.

27
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,680
I'm...

28
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,900
Well, I have streamed a little bit.

29
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:25,280
And by a little bit, I mean like the most littlest bit in the past, like, two weeks.

30
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,560
Hi, back, baby.

31
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,440
Hi!

32
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,240
I won't forget you, buddy.

33
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,700
Don't you?

34
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,280
Forget about me.

35
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,840
Now you've been super busy.

36
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
No!

37
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,140
Your performance for Kiara's birthday.

38
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,780
That was wonderful.

39
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,860
Thank you!

40
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,100
Yeah...

41
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,680
Oh my gosh.

42
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,620
For those who...

43
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,780
I feel...

44
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,760
I feel...

45
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
I feel...

46
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,300
Like...

47
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,060
There might be some people that don't use Twitter.

48
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,840
And I really like...

49
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,960
Okay, actually, I don't know where you've been.

50
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,980
So...

51
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,970
I can...

52
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,400
I...

53
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,020
I...

54
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,420
Oh gosh.

55
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,440
So much has happened.

56
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,120
It feels like...

57
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,860
It feels like a year has happened.

58
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,440
I don't use Twitter.

59
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,380
Well, if you're ever like...

60
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,680
If you're ever like...

61
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,900
Where the heck is Minto?

62
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,840
She hasn't streamed in a bit.

63
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,200
I say...

64
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,380
I say...

65
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,120
I say...

66
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,340
That's the best place to get updates.

67
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,460
Probably.

68
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,740
A few cons and concerts recently.

69
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,600
I know!

70
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,640
I know, I know!

71
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,820
You're everywhere.

72
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,120
You're VTuber royalty!

73
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,840
How...

74
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,760
How does that make me royalty?

75
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,080
I'm just a maid.

76
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,440
I'm just a maid.

77
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,730
The VTuber of VTubers.

78
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,730
Mission Worldwide.

79
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,510
Oh my gosh.

80
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,510
Have you guys seen that like...

81
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,030
With Pip?

82
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,350
Pitbull.

83
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,590
Have you seen that like...

84
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,190
His concerts recently?

85
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,710
Oh my gosh.

86
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,390
First of all, Pitbull is so cute.

87
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,570
He's like...

88
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:41,350
So Gap Boy.

89
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,030
But...

90
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,150
If you have not seen...

91
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,030
It's so funny...

92
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,090
That...

93
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,390
The...

94
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,510
That girlies will go see Pitbull.

95
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,350
But they'll wear bald caps.

96
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,870
And they'll wear like...

97
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:53,630
Button ups.

98
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:54,850
And...

99
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:55,670
And...

100
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,590
Tight pants.

101
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,790
And they'll...

102
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,830
That's what they do.

103
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,230
And he loves it.

104
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:05,750
He loves it.

105
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,830
He like...

106
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,650
He's just like...

107
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:07,730
Yeah.

108
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,750
I hope you know...

109
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,850
When you put on that bald cap...

110
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,430
That you're gonna have the best night of your life.

111
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,790
It's kind of awesome.

112
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:21,990
Yeah.

113
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,990
Pitbull is like...

114
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,570
Made a resurgence because of it.

115
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,810
He seems really chill guy.

116
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:29,270
Yeah.

117
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,030
I think so too.

118
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,150
He kind of loves...

119
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,570
That...

120
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:32,970
You know...

121
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,790
He just has embraced it.

122
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,150
Which is so great.

123
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,550
But yeah.

124
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,130
Anyway.

125
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:38,870
Well...

126
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,150
Let's see.

127
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,750
There was...

128
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,230
Off-Kai.

129
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,670
Off-Kai happened.

130
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,050
And...

131
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,150
Then after...

132
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,270
I went right to Japan.

133
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,590
And then...

134
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:53,750
There...

135
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,350
There was some stuff I did there.

136
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,850
And then...

137
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,810
And then...

138
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,110
Boom!

139
00:09:59,270 --> 00:09:59,470
Bam!

140
00:09:59,630 --> 00:09:59,830
Boom!

141
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,310
Bam!

142
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:00,850
Boom!

143
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:01,370
Boom!

144
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:01,690
Right...

145
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,250
One after one after one.

146
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,510
I was in...

147
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:04,890
Concert!

148
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,510
Concert!

149
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:06,650
Appearance!

150
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,230
Appearance!

151
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,870
Concert!

152
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,650
Boom!

153
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:09,890
Bam!

154
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,150
Boom!

155
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,350
Boom!

156
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,630
Bam!

157
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,350
It was crazy.

158
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,610
It was crazy.

159
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:16,250
And then...

160
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:16,970
I'm back.

161
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,230
Then I'm back.

162
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,780
Then you had a heart attack this morning.

163
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,980
If my heart was beating...

164
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,060
If my heart was beating...

165
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,140
It would be...

166
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
It would...

167
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,140
It would have stopped.

168
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,660
Oh my goodness.

169
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,520
Between Off-Kai, Fantastic Reality, and Virtual Vacation, I've gotten to see so much Minto.

170
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,300
Yeah!

171
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,240
So...

172
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,940
Lots and lots of...

173
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,280
I did lots and lots of...

174
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,600
Off-Line...

175
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:51,900
Events.

176
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,280
So...

177
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,500
So...

178
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,160
I'll...

179
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,660
It was...

180
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,260
Oh...

181
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,160
Golly!

182
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,620
It all just kind of...

183
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,680
Stacked on top of each other at once.

184
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,280
So...

185
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,840
I was like...

186
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,740
So much happened.

187
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,700
But...

188
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:19,840
No!

189
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,880
Off-Kai,楽しかった!

190
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,420
Yatta!

191
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
Oh, it was fun for me too.

192
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,000
I got to do...

193
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,460
I got to...

194
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,640
I think I talked about it a little bit.

195
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,440
First time, Dodo!

196
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,680
First time, Dodo!

197
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,300
Thank you, Bubbleshop!

198
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,040
Without my Kamijushi back...

199
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,940
Thank you!

200
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,400
How did you escape Wawa's ghost vacuum?

201
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,980
Hold on, hold on.

202
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,800
I want to go in order.

203
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,760
I want to go in order.

204
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,040
So we first start with Off-Kai.

205
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,040
Where I appeared...

206
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
Ayami Mama's panel.

207
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,040
And...

208
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,240
And...

209
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,360
I did the MGS panel.

210
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Which I...

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,920
I think I've already talked about these though, no?

212
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,820
I did stream a little bit.

213
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,220
I did...

214
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:08,840
Um...

215
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,280
Where...

216
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,160
Where was it a...

217
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,660
Where was it a Twitter space?

218
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,080
Oh yeah!

219
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,460
And I did the spit and greet!

220
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,220
I guess...

221
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,060
It was a Twitter space.

222
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,540
Okay, then we'll talk about it here.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,440
Cause...

224
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,940
Twitter space...

225
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,560
Is it's own thing.

226
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,180
I missed it if you did.

227
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,200
I missed it if you did.

228
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:28,760
Yeah!

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,820
I guess it was the Twitter.

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,480
There was a space.

231
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:31,940
Okay.

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,680
Um...

233
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,420
Oh golly.

234
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,160
It feels like it was so long ago.

235
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,420
Yours and Ayami's panel was really fun.

236
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,220
I'm glad!

237
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,200
Thank you!

238
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:44,840
Um...

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,160
Uh...

240
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,660
We...

241
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,420
She...

242
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,340
Had me...

243
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,220
Teach her English.

244
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,840
And...

245
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,000
I felt really dumb.

246
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,940
I was like...

247
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,840
I can't think of anything...

248
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,920
Fuck...

249
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,920
I can't...

250
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,020
Think of anything for these...

251
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,560
For these words!

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,400
I mean...

253
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,260
I don't like being put on the spot like that.

254
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,140
Um...

255
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,880
So I was like...

256
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,060
Oh gosh...

257
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,140
Start with the alphabet.

258
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,260
Do you even speak English?

259
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:13,680
No!

260
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,120
No!

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,520
What did you teach her?

262
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,580
I taught her that...

263
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,520
She was like...

264
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,940
How do I say...

265
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,120
I'm hot...

266
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,060
In English.

267
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,620
Or...

268
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,140
And I was like...

269
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,560
I taught her to say...

270
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,100
You're a snack.

271
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,100
Even when I met her recently...

272
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,820
Well, actually...

273
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,760
Actually, never mind.

274
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,120
No.

275
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,940
She completely forgot it.

276
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,380
I met her...

277
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,840
I met her just a couple days ago.

278
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,600
And she was like...

279
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,380
She was like...

280
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,860
I don't remember anything you taught me.

281
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,320
Who?

282
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,180
My mama!

283
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,580
Ayami mama!

284
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,640
My mama!

285
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,220
My mama!

286
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,220
We did a...

287
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,480
We did a panel together.

288
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,860
And...

290
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,680
Um...

291
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,340
She's honest.

292
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,200
That's true.

293
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,460
Actually...

294
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,380
It's funny...

295
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,280
My tea that I'm drinking right now...

296
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,060
Is from our collab...

297
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,760
Is the mug from the collab cafe.

298
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,380
Did you give her some Mountain Dew?

299
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,480
Oh...

300
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,260
I did tell...

301
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,780
Offkai staff...

302
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,140
I was...

303
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,980
I told somebody.

304
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,860
I was like...

305
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,060
Ayami really likes Baha Blast.

306
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,340
Ayami...

307
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,060
I am food.

308
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,020
Yeah, she likes a Baha Blast.

309
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,480
And I think she got maybe...

310
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,460
Too much...

311
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,620
Too much Baha Blast.

312
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,040
I think she got...

313
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,740
She calls it American Water.

314
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,420
I think she got...

315
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,420
A lot of it.

316
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:01,680
Like...

317
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,520
A lot...

318
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,740
Of Baha Blast.

319
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,300
Um...

320
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,380
Oh my gosh though...

321
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,460
There was one thing...

322
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,380
Um...

323
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,220
Somehow...

324
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,980
Even though I was not a guest...

325
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,480
At...

326
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,460
Offkai...

327
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,020
I got access to the...

328
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,440
The guest lounge.

329
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,040
Sometimes...

330
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,700
Sometimes...

331
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:18,520
Ayami...

332
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,800
And I would go and eat in there.

333
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,060
Just to kind of...

334
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,360
Have a place to eat.

335
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,320
Um...

336
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:25,920
And...

337
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,420
Oh...

338
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,640
Fancy...

339
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,620
Yeah...

340
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,120
I went in there for something...

341
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,060
I think I was waiting for Barry...

342
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,900
Before...

343
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,820
The Metal Gear...

344
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:36,380
Metal...

345
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,040
Metal Gear...

346
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,860
Panel...

347
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,250
Which...

348
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,260
Oh my gosh...

349
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:41,740
Did you guys...

350
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,260
Have you guys been watching...

351
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:43,780
AGD...

352
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,000
AGD...

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,340
I was watching...

354
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,360
Earlier...

355
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,000
In Apache...

356
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,160
Um...

357
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,900
Apache...

358
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,380
Did...

359
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,160
The...

360
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,060
MGS3 run...

361
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,420
Um...

362
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:57,980
I saw Apache...

363
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,800
Yeah...

364
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,360
I watched Apache's run...

365
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,030
He's so crazy...

366
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,600
Yeah...

367
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,060
A...

368
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,460
G...

369
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:04,760
D...

370
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,160
Ah...

371
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,000
Didn't know they were streaming...

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,080
Yup... Yup... Yup...

373
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
Yup... Yup... Yup...

374
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,180
Yup... Yup...

375
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,760
I think it just started...

376
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:12,800
No?

377
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,560
This week?

378
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,560
Right?

379
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,060
I donated...

380
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,510
But my donation...

381
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,590
Did not get read...

382
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,570
Sad, sad...

383
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:29,850
Um...

384
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,010
Started yesterday...

385
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:31,470
Oh...

386
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:31,990
Yeah, yeah...

387
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,830
Okay...

388
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,070
Um...

389
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,890
Bye...

390
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,330
Oof...

391
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:38,530
Donoworld...

392
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,910
Um...

393
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,830
But...

394
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,650
Uh...

395
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,090
Yeah...

396
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,990
I was waiting for Barry...

397
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:48,390
And...

398
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:49,330
In the...

399
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:49,950
In the...

400
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,070
Guest lounge...

401
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,910
And I go in there...

402
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,090
Oh...

403
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:53,690
Actually no...

404
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:53,950
I was...

405
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,190
I think I was in there first...

406
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,610
And then some people came in...

407
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,410
And I'm like...

408
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:57,970
Wow...

409
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,550
What an attractive...

410
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,910
Group of people...

411
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:04,750
Gosh...

412
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,470
It's kind of...

413
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,170
Like...

414
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,110
Okay...

415
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,610
It always makes me be like...

416
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:13,730
Oh...

417
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,570
When I see...

418
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,270
Okay...

419
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,470
This is gonna sound really weird...

420
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,310
When I see hot people...

421
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,070
Being VTubers...

422
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,110
I'm like...

423
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:24,730
Why

424
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,520
are you a VTuber?

425
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,300
Leave it for us Uggos...

426
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,960
Okay...

427
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,940
But anyway...

428
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,120
I was like...

429
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,540
Damn...

430
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,140
These people...

431
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:46,920
What like...

432
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,520
The hottest group of people ever...

433
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,520
And...

434
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,060
Then...

435
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,720
I was like...

436
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,600
Okay...

437
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,720
I was being kinda creepy...

438
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,660
I was just eating my food by myself...

439
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,080
Okay...

440
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,100
I was just eating my food by myself...

441
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,660
And I was like...

442
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,100
I think I recognize this voice...

443
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,820
And...

444
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,540
And...

445
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,400
It was...

446
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,080
It was...

447
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,620
It was...

448
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,800
I...

449
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,600
And I kind of...

450
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:09,980
I'm like...

451
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,460
I'm like...

452
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:10,720
Okay...

453
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm gonna ask...

454
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,000
Sorry...

455
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,340
My brain is like...

456
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,260
Not working right now...

457
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:16,720
I was like...

458
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,540
I'm gonna ask...

459
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,140
And see...

460
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,840
And I was like...

461
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,320
Um...

462
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,300
Excuse me?

463
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,560
And they were like, yeah?

464
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,360
And I was like, are you guys Asteroid Music Group?

465
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,100
And they were like, yeah?

466
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,760
And I was like, oh, I'm Mito!

467
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,140
I'm sorry for being creepy!

468
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,940
You met Moni!

469
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,920
Yes!

470
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,060
Oh my gosh, Moni is so cute.

471
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,120
For those who don't know, Asteroid, they have worked...

472
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,560
worked with Kiara a lot for her songs.

473
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,780
Like, they just... Kiara's newest song, Tasty.

474
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,000
They did that.

475
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:16,340
So... Which... We... Actually, I don't want to say this yet.

476
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,800
Because I don't... I don't know if I can.

477
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,500
But I'll talk about it later.

478
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,300
Once it's out.

479
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,920
But... Yeah, so I got to meet them!

480
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,280
And Moni, I was like... I was like... You're so... You're so pretty.

481
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,920
You're so cute.

482
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,620
She... She's like Barbie.

483
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,000
I told her that.

484
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,220
I was like, you're like Barbie.

485
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,360
And the way she talks is like...

486
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,780
She's... So...

487
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,800
She was... So cute.

488
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,920
I know.

489
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,560
And she kind of was just like... Barbie.

490
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,380
I'll accept that as a compliment.

491
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,380
I was like... Oh my God, thank you.

492
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,820
I was like...

493
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:10,450
I was like... She's real.

494
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,330
Did she drop your spaghetti?

495
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,250
Oh, absolutely.

496
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,510
I was like... Oh no.

497
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,730
She's so pretty.

498
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:22,910
Holy cow.

499
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,550
She is so... I spilled every spaghetti...

500
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,630
Noodle...

501
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,490
Oh my God.

502
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,950
And then... And then there were some cosplayers...

503
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,970
That... That were... They were dressed up as like...

504
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,090
The Face Connect girls.

505
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,130
And... And... I saw them.

506
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,310
And I was like... They came up to me.

507
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,330
And I was like... Wow!

508
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,970
And they were like... Oh... We're fans.

509
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,870
And I was like... Boobs!

510
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:57,610
I was like... I was like... So... Sorry!

511
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,710
Sorry!

512
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,270
And like... I couldn't stop staring!

513
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,070
And, and they were like, it's okay to stare.

514
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,010
And then, and then, then, then they shoved their boobs in my face.

515
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,930
Ofka was fun, I think.

516
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,450
I,

517
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,800
I didn't mean to look so much.

518
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,260
But they were brilliant.

519
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,300
Perky.

520
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,870
And they were beautiful, beautiful, beautiful women.

521
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,310
Yeah.

522
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:48,630
And,

523
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:58,470
um, I heard about the, uh, the lines at Yummy Mama's booth.

524
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:05,810
Thank you guys for, and I liked seeing everybody's pictures of their, um...

525
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:08,170
You're just like, I remember.

526
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,830
I'm sorry.

527
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:16,730
No need to brag.

528
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,630
Like, hey, hey, it's my rare W, okay?

529
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:24,230
Let me, let me have this.

530
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:32,790
But, uh, people posted the little badges that they got, um, from the gacha.

531
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:39,390
Oh, I tried to make each, uh, each single one different in some way.

532
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,810
Each single one had a different design.

533
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,270
And, uh, Yummy Mama was just like...

534
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,190
She was like, you're still not done.

535
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,210
And I'd be like, no.

536
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,790
And I'm...

537
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,190
Are you the reason for the sweaty smell of off-cut?

538
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,250
What are you talking about?

539
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,250
People said I smell nice.

540
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,770
They said I smell nice.

541
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,290
Double Ayamid Sign Badge.

542
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:08,670
Ooh!

543
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,110
Yeah.

544
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,690
But I think, even if you didn't get the sign badge...

545
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:17,010
I think every single one of them was really cute.

546
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:19,550
I think...

547
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,530
I think everybody is a winner, probably.

548
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:22,590
Mmm...

549
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:23,930
Mmm-mmm-mm-mm-mm...

550
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:28,430
They had to get a map to clean up the jewel.

551
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:32,810
But...

552
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,910
But...

553
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,410
Yeah.

554
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,070
So...

555
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:42,910
Congrats to everybody that did get the sign ones, though.

556
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,650
Ooh, Mimi!

557
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,210
No, because you did smell nice, though!

558
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,630
You guys are so... You're a whole group.

559
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,830
Why are you so... Why are you guys so pretty?

560
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,630
Not that I sniffed, but...

561
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,250
Why are you guys so pretty, BB?

562
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:14,910
Hold on, let me give you a wrench so that I can find you better.

563
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:24,830
I wasn't gonna do the wrench thing, because I didn't want people to feel pressured about being mods or whatever, but...

564
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,590
I think I'll just start giving them out again.

565
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,210
So are you!

566
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,130
No, no!

567
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,510
You're so cute!

568
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,230
You're so pretty!

569
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:39,750
Immediately turns into the world's cutest four-foot-tall neighbor at the top.

570
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,050
That's not... No!

571
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,360
I wasn't able to buy a lot at the IME booth because of JPEG Dog.

572
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,800
Oh, I saw JPEG Dog.

573
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah, the Metal Gear panel.

574
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:54,800
Oh my gosh.

575
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,660
I... That was like the most fun ever panel.

576
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,720
People have recorded it and uploaded it if you're curious, but...

577
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,460
I had so much...

578
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,200
So, so much fun...

579
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,260
With the Metal Gear panel, with Barry...

580
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,300
I love the Trivia panel.

581
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,020
Yes!

582
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,080
It was so, so fun!

583
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,060
It was so fun!

584
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,260
Poor Jets.

585
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,140
I... I know.

586
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,220
I felt really bad.

587
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,340
I was like, I think...

588
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,780
I felt so bad.

589
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,680
I think Jets was having, like...

590
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,380
Well, before even the panel started, we knew Jets was having trouble with her computer.

591
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,580
And then...

592
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,540
And then...

593
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,400
I think the...

594
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:35,800
The...

595
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:36,840
The ping.

596
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,780
The Australian ping.

597
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,620
So...

598
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,240
Um...

599
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,560
I believe Jets would've...

600
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,120
But Grimmie and I were fighting.

601
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,500
It was down to literal milliseconds.

602
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,740
For some of...

603
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,220
For her and I...

604
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,720
Trying to...

605
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
To...

606
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,180
To...

607
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,420
To...

608
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:55,560
To...

609
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,020
To...

610
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,460
To...

611
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:57,780
I...

612
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,140
I...

613
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,620
Grimmie's reflexes were insane!

614
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,380
Crazy!

615
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:04,960
Yeah!

616
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,800
Didn't you have one millisecond at all?

617
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,160
Yes!

618
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,500
Yes!

619
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:07,940
We did!

620
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,400
We did!

621
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,220
Literal millisecond!

622
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,720
It was...

623
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,140
It was actually really crazy.

624
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,060
I...

625
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,700
When I would, like, press...

626
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,580
I think...

627
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,600
Like, I was going, like...

628
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,240
You know, like, really fast.

629
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,140
I think I should've done the double taps.

630
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,600
Like a...

631
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,460
Like a...

632
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:23,800
Like a...

633
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,720
Hold on, like a...

634
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,400
Hold on, I'm gonna demonstrate on my phone.

635
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,220
Can you hear that?

636
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,120
Like that?

637
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,760
But instead I was just doing...

638
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,920
I was doing this, but I should've gone...

639
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,020
You know, for extra speed?

640
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,240
I should've.

641
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,340
I should've.

642
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,080
But...

643
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:52,920
It was such...

644
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,700
A lot of fun.

645
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,700
I love berry.

646
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,400
Berry is so fun.

647
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,560
But berry...

648
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,980
Berry is...

649
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,140
I'm so glad that I'm friends with berry.

650
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,100
And I'm so glad that I could do that panel.

651
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,200
So...

652
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,100
Check out berry bug, everybody.

653
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,700
Berry bug!

654
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,100
Nah...

655
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,130
We've been talking a lot more recently too, so...

656
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,360
Yeah!

657
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,780
Um...

658
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,040
So that was a lot of fun.

659
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,520
Um...

660
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,400
After I went to Japan...

661
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:29,940
Um...

662
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,560
Initially...

663
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,480
Um...

664
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,360
I was going back to Japan because...

665
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:35,800
Um...

666
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,540
I got invited to...

667
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,140
I wasn't a guest.

668
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,520
Like, performance guest.

669
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,220
But I was invited by Toho Lost Word.

670
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,380
Um...

671
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,100
For those...

672
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,020
Who know...

673
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,220
Those who don't know...

674
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,440
I sang a cover song for them.

675
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,280
Uh...

676
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,340
You can find the link in the description!

677
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,460
Um...

678
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,680
But, uh...

679
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,820
They invited me...

680
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,960
To just come watch.

681
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:00,660
And...

682
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,020
Um...

683
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,600
It was crazy.

684
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,280
I get there.

685
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:03,980
And...

686
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,360
I get there, and...

687
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,900
I'm just sitting.

688
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,420
I'm chilling.

689
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,940
And I brought a friend with me...

690
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,660
Who could help interpret.

691
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,780
And...

692
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,640
Um...

693
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,500
Oh my gosh.

694
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
I'm like...

695
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,240
I got there pretty early, actually.

696
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,520
And I like...

697
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,080
See a bunch...

698
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,360
A group of people...

699
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,180
Walk...

700
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,980
Over...

701
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,460
And I'm like...

702
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,320
Oh...

703
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,240
More people coming.

704
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,880
And then I'm like...

705
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:30,820
Thank you!

706
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,680
Thank you!

707
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,920
Thank you!

708
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,120
Seeing you at Alfkai made me so happy!

709
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,680
It's been so fun to see the results of all your hard work...

710
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,080
With all your amazing concert performances...

711
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,720
You make the way so proud!

712
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,880
Thank you!

713
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,500
Did I say hi to Zun Sama?

714
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:47,620
No.

715
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,500
I was like...

716
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,140
I'm not gonna be...

717
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,940
I'm not gonna be cringe.

718
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,000
But also, he was sitting with Beat Mario.

719
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,120
And I'm like...

720
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,430
So I was like...

721
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,270
And...

722
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,870
But...

723
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,390
They're okay.

724
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,070
So...

725
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,610
Another performer I really wanted to see there...

726
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:17,870
Is...

727
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:18,610
Nemoto Nagi.

728
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,390
And she...

729
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,330
She...

730
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,010
Is an idol.

731
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:22,930
Uh...

732
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,090
She's part of Deer Stage.

733
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,710
And she was part of a...

734
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,330
Idol group.

735
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,070
She's not anymore.

736
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,250
But she was a part of...

737
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,190
Depagumi Inc.

738
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,450
As well as an idol group called...

739
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,490
Niji no Conquistador.

740
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,410
Or...

741
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,810
Which one is Snake...

742
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,730
And which one is Otacon?

743
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,290
What do you mean?

744
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:43,670
Zun?

745
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,130
Deer Stage is a group...

746
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:53,850
And an idol cafe?

747
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,790
Yes!

748
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,070
So Deer Stage is like...

749
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:58,050
Deer Stage is a location.

750
00:29:58,770 --> 00:29:59,590
It is...

751
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,770
An idol bar...

752
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:01,990
And cafe...

753
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:02,810
And theater.

754
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,270
There's three floors.

755
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:04,970
One is...

756
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,870
The first one is the theater.

757
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:06,790
Second one is the cafe.

758
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,610
Third one is the bar.

759
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:09,930
And...

760
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:11,530
And...

761
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,110
Um...

762
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,930
Uh...

763
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,450
They also produce idol groups.

764
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:16,470
Yeah, yeah.

765
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,290
And...

766
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,870
Um...

767
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:20,750
I...

768
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:21,750
There's a...

769
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,550
There's a guy...

770
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,210
Obviously that I work with...

771
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,650
For Toho Lost Work.

772
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,150
And...

773
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,530
He has been so awesome.

774
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,050
He knows that I really...

775
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,210
Am a fan of idols.

776
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,690
And so...

777
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,150
Um...

778
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,210
He even got me...

779
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,690
Like a Shikishi...

780
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:39,870
Um...

781
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,390
A...

782
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,630
Hand signed...

783
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,730
Addressed to me...

784
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,110
By another...

785
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,510
Ex-member of Denpa Gumi Inc.

786
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:47,030
Who helps with Toho Lost Word.

787
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:47,990
So...

788
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,130
So like...

789
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,570
It's been...

790
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,790
He's been very very kind to me.

791
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,050
And...

792
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:57,910
Uh...

793
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,490
Before the show started...

794
00:30:59,490 --> 00:30:59,730
I...

795
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,590
I talked to him.

796
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,150
And he was just like...

797
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:02,850
Uh...

798
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,250
He said...

799
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,370
Oh, by the way...

800
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,410
Um...

801
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,530
I talked with...

802
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,950
Nemotonagi-san...

803
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,590
And...

804
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,610
She wants to meet you!

805
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,850
And I was like...

806
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,490
Me?

807
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,410
Huh?

808
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:18,430
Huh?

809
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,490
Huh?

810
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:19,910
Huh?

811
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:20,170
Huh?

812
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:23,650
And...

813
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:24,270
Uh...

814
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,110
She...

815
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,310
Oh my gosh...

816
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,090
I didn't...

817
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,510
I spilled my spaghetti a little bit...

818
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,030
But...

819
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:30,990
She...

820
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,010
I was...

821
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:33,070
Watching the show...

822
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,730
And at one point...

823
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,530
I went to go get a drink...

824
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,430
And I come back...

825
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,470
And I see...

826
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,370
That she was sitting behind me...

827
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:41,810
Um...

828
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,330
Um...

829
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:44,150
She's right behind me...

830
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:44,530
Isn't she?

831
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,790
But...

832
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,510
I like...

833
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,570
The show was happening...

834
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,670
So I obviously didn't talk to her...

835
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:55,690
But I just kind of like...

836
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,610
I like...

837
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:57,190
I go like...

838
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,250
Ha!

839
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:57,830
Ha!

840
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:58,910
Ha!

841
00:31:58,910 --> 00:31:59,190
Ha!

842
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,250
Ha!

843
00:31:59,250 --> 00:31:59,290
Ha!

844
00:31:59,290 --> 00:31:59,450
Ha!

845
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:00,910
And...

846
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,050
Ha!

847
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,450
Ha!

848
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:04,890
Ha!

849
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,690
I wave back...

850
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,670
And I'm like...

851
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:06,950
Ha!

852
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:09,230
And she's like...

853
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,130
Laughing...

854
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,390
Ha!

855
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:10,710
Ha!

856
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,480
And then after the show...

857
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,840
I'm like...

858
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,800
Okay...

859
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,940
I'll wait...

860
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,980
I'll wait...

861
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,600
To meet...

862
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,460
Nemotonagi...

863
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,060
Also...

864
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,440
Like...

865
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,100
Though...

866
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,100
There were other...

867
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,980
Amazing...

868
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,500
Performers there...

869
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,060
Um...

870
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:28,700
Uh...

871
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,320
I did not get...

872
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,240
To meet...

873
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,700
Nakajima Megumi...

874
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,820
But she was there too...

875
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,840
But um...

876
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,220
I was just kind of standing there...

877
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,160
And...

878
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,220
And...

879
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,760
Nemo san comes up to me...

880
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,200
And she's just like...

881
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,400
She's like, I...

882
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,460
I...

883
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,880
I...

884
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,420
I've...

885
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,080
I've want to meet you!

886
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,140
I've wanted to meet you!

887
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,480
I watch your streams!

888
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,660
Wait...

889
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,580
What do you mean to've watched my streams!

890
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,600
And then she's like, Yeah!

891
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,540
So do you guys know Nyarruda?

892
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,500
Nyarruda is the...

893
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,760
Is...

894
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,060
Is the writer...

895
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,540
For a needy streamer...

896
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,760
The game.

897
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,020
And he...

898
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,180
I guess he's kind of a fan of me.

899
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,880
But he will sometimes tweet about me.

900
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,400
And... I don't know how...

901
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,480
How he's out... I don't know how he found me.

902
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,040
And... he...

903
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,680
And so Nemo was just like...

904
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,780
Yeah, I found you through Nyaruda.

905
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,140
And I was like...

906
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:34,880
I like...

907
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,580
I literally...

908
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,760
I was like Nyaruda.

909
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,480
And then Nemo...

910
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,400
Nemo asks me.

911
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,700
She's just like...

912
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,660
She's like...

913
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,060
Can I have her Discord?

914
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,020
So now I...

915
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,800
Okay...

916
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,620
And to make...

917
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,080
Okay, two.

918
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,760
Two.

919
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,100
Just show you guys how... How truly insane all of this is, okay?

920
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,660
Hold on.

921
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,500
Give me one second.

922
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,860
Give me one second.

923
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,540
Give me one second.

924
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,120
Give me one second.

925
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,440
Give me one second.

926
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,720
I forgot to set this up beforehand.

927
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,140
I forgot to set this up!

928
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,020
One second, one second, one second.

929
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,500
One second, one second, one second.

930
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,900
Okay, okay.

931
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,760
Okay, hold on.

932
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,700
Okay, hold on.

933
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,280
One second.

934
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,320
One second!

935
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,420
Oh, I forgot to say it.

936
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,040
I

937
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,570
forgot...

938
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,850
Okay, wait.

939
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,310
Oh, hold on, I messed it up.

940
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:51,010
Okay, okay.

941
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,130
Okay, okay, okay, hold on.

942
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:54,130
Hold on!

943
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,870
Hold on, sorry.

944
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,910
You'll understand in like two seconds.

945
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:58,890
Okay.

946
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,000
Okay.

947
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:16,880
This...

948
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,580
This is my introduction video...

949
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,780
Um...

950
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,540
From...

951
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,740
July 18th...

952
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,440
2020.

953
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,980
Right?

954
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,220
This is my...

955
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,980
This is my...

956
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,000
This is my introduction video...

957
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,820
From...

958
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,740
July 18th...

959
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,520
2020.

960
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:39,320
Okay?

961
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,280
Okay?

962
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,340
There's no sound.

963
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,580
But I said I like to watch...

964
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,620
What?

965
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,340
Nijinoko Kissador?

966
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:49,920
Right?

967
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,280
That...

968
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,350
Is Nemoto Nagi!

969
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,910
I now have her Discord!

970
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,100
Can you imagine?

971
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,480
Can you?

972
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,780
Can you imagine?

973
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,720
Me from five years ago...

974
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,580
Literally talking about her...

975
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,820
And then...

976
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,040
Now!

977
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,300
Now!

978
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,740
I...

979
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,560
I...

980
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,540
Literally...

981
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,480
I literally have her on Discord now!

982
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,060
Isn't that the craziest thing?

983
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,840
She's gorgeous, I know!

984
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,800
Oh my gosh, she's even cuter in person!

985
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,940
And she watches your streams...

986
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,420
I know!

987
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:46,620
Wow!

988
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,140
If you told yourself back then...

989
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,060
You would probably explode!

990
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:52,740
I would!

991
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,480
Right now, I'm even starting to cry!

992
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:09,920
Yeah...

993
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,220
So I just thought it was so, so crazy...

994
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,040
That like...

995
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,280
I literally...

996
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,360
Have a picture of her...

997
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,400
In my debut!

998
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
From...

999
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,840
From...

1000
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,720
From five years ago!

1001
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,200
Almost to the day!

1002
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,840
July 18th!

1003
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,100
It's the 7th!

1004
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,620
So...

1005
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,400
I'm gonna cry...

1006
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,680
I'm so happy...

1007
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:57,230
It's so crazy...

1008
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,730
It's so crazy...

1009
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,490
Sorry...

1010
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,990
It all kinda just set in right now!

1011
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,680
No...

1012
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,660
No...

1013
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,480
So...

1014
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,100
Um...

1015
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,520
Yeah!

1016
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,180
Yeah, so... Just that.

1017
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,580
That alone made me really happy that I went.

1018
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,000
Because I was like, oh, I'm going back to Japan.

1019
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,720
But I'm so happy that I got to meet her.

1020
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,900
And she... What is my Discord?

1021
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,160
So... That's that story.

1022
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,940
The live itself, I also intended on going and filming it.

1023
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,800
But I wasn't allowed to.

1024
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,720
So I'm sorry.

1025
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:05,280
I was like, oh, I can make like a little vlog or something about it.

1026
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:12,960
But unfortunately... Those kinds of things are a little... A little difficult to get permissions for.

1027
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,000
So...

1028
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,660
But um... Yeah, hold on.

1029
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,680
Let me just... I'm going to go through my pictures.

1030
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,660
To help me remember... Remember things.

1031
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,240
Because now my brain is... Oh!

1032
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,860
I forgot to say though!

1033
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,540
Oh my gosh.

1034
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,920
Before I went to Japan... After Off-Kai, I got to go to a place I've always, always wanted to go to before.

1035
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,120
Called the Winchester House.

1036
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:41,500
And...

1037
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,200
I got to go.

1038
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,560
And...

1039
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,400
It was so... Actually, it was so fancy.

1040
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,280
Ghost House.

1041
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:51,740
I did!

1042
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,500
I did!

1043
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:52,840
I did!

1044
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,080
I did!

1045
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,760
I went to the Ghost House.

1046
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,780
And I was like, uh...

1047
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,380
Fellow Ghosts!

1048
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:58,400
Hello!

1049
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,960
Like from Supernatural?

1050
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,300
That's what they're named after.

1051
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,480
The Winchester Boys?

1052
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,520
Named after the Winchester House.

1053
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,640
And... Oh my gosh though.

1054
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,060
Okay.

1055
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,180
I went in being like...

1056
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,320
I'm gonna get...

1057
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,160
I'm gonna get spooked.

1058
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,600
It's gonna be so scary.

1059
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,340
Wait, the Maze House?

1060
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1061
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,520
So basically, for those who don't know...

1062
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,500
Um...

1063
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,420
It's a house...

1064
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,420
Built by...

1065
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:25,840
Uh...

1066
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,700
The daughter of the guy that created the Winchester Rifle.

1067
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,420
And...

1068
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:32,540
She...

1069
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:33,700
Had a tragic...

1070
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,740
Very...

1071
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,320
She's had...

1072
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,720
She had a really tragic life.

1073
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,960
And she talked with a medium one day.

1074
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,180
Being...

1075
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:40,920
Cause she was just like...

1076
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,680
Why are all these bad things happening to me?

1077
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,960
And they were like...

1078
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,200
It's because you are haunted by the ghosts...

1079
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,040
Of those that were killed by the rifle.

1080
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,700
And so...

1081
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,900
She...

1082
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,580
Um...

1083
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,820
Built this house...

1084
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,040
That is like a maze.

1085
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,880
And when it is...

1086
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,520
It is...

1087
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,360
Really, truly...

1088
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,560
Like a maze.

1089
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,980
I heard it's designed to confuse ghosts.

1090
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,520
Yeah.

1091
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,140
It's like...

1092
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,480
It's...

1093
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,840
It's very extremely disorienting.

1094
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,440
Actually.

1095
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:11,880
It's very crazy.

1096
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,520
I've never experienced anything like it before.

1097
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,020
That medium did her dirty.

1098
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:18,980
It's...

1099
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,080
Were you confused?

1100
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:21,900
I was!

1101
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,080
I was!

1102
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,740
I was!

1103
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:27,800
It worked.

1104
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,720
I know.

1105
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,420
Because I'm a ghost.

1106
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,480
I was so disorienting.

1107
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,260
I was like...

1108
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,580
I've never experienced anything like it before.

1109
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,700
But...

1110
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,060
Honestly...

1111
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,380
I...

1112
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:44,820
Like I said...

1113
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,540
I went in expecting full spooky.

1114
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,520
And...

1115
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,300
I left...

1116
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:51,920
With...

1117
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
The greatest appreciation...

1118
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,460
The greatest appreciation for that woman.

1119
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,020
I feel that...

1120
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,860
So...

1121
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,500
It was...

1122
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,520
Hold on.

1123
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:07,260
It...

1124
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,260
Okay, so...

1125
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,460
She was Minto height too.

1126
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,200
I know.

1127
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,880
Was it a day or night tour?

1128
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,420
It was a...

1129
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:19,240
It was a day tour.

1130
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:19,860
Yeah, yeah.

1131
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,900
You just end up feeling empathy.

1132
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,820
I was...

1133
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,760
I...

1134
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,600
I was like...

1135
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,140
Oh my gosh.

1136
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,720
I felt so bad for...

1137
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,300
So...

1138
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,000
Her name is Sarah.

1139
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,940
Sarah Winchester.

1140
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,260
I ended up feeling so bad for her.

1141
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:38,980
Honestly...

1142
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:41,480
I think like a lot of the things surrounding her...

1143
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,220
Like why she built the house...

1144
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,000
And stuff like that.

1145
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,820
Or like...

1146
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,700
So basically...

1147
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,160
The house is built very confusing like...

1148
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,000
And very much like a maze.

1149
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:54,480
And the rumors are that it was to confuse...

1150
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,060
To confuse...

1151
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,240
The ghosts and all.

1152
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,900
But I think it's truly just because she was so lonely.

1153
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:03,620
I think it was because she just wanted...

1154
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,120
To keep people around.

1155
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,280
Because as soon as the construction of the house is done...

1156
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,340
Oh, the people are gone.

1157
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,500
Her history is very interesting.

1158
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,080
Like...

1159
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,180
So...

1160
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,220
She...

1161
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,260
Tried for a kid...

1162
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,620
With her husband.

1163
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,520
She lost the one kid that she had.

1164
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,240
And then lost her husband.

1165
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,000
All within a very short...

1166
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,140
Time frame of each other.

1167
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,840
And that kind of...

1168
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,660
I feel set her spiraling.

1169
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,020
But she was also...

1170
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,760
Such a...

1171
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,420
Such a kind person.

1172
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:41,950
Like...

1173
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,660
Everybody who worked at her mansion.

1174
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,500
She...

1175
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:48,680
Paid for...

1176
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,200
Everything.

1177
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,660
And...

1178
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,320
Also...

1179
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,700
Paid for like...

1180
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,840
Of their houses.

1181
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,260
She paid...

1182
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,940
For them for like...

1183
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,300
The rest of their lives basically.

1184
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,180
And...

1185
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,020
She treated them extremely well.

1186
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,000
And...

1187
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,220
Even like...

1188
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,540
Even like...

1189
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:09,060
And this was...

1190
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:09,140
What?

1191
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:10,240
The...

1192
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:10,800
Eight...

1193
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,840
Eighteen hundreds?

1194
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,640
And such?

1195
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,040
Late eighteen hundreds?

1196
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,400
And like...

1197
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:16,920
She...

1198
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,280
Like...

1199
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,380
Treated everybody well.

1200
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,140
Like...

1201
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,040
And...

1202
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,020
It was...

1203
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,860
It was just so...

1204
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:27,780
Oh my gosh.

1205
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,780
She was just so generous.

1206
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,180
Yeah.

1207
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,420
And it made me feel like...

1208
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,740
So instead of like being like...

1209
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,180
Oh, this was so spooky.

1210
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,500
I was like...

1211
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:37,160
Oh my gosh.

1212
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,740
Sarah Winchester was the goat.

1213
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,560
There.

1214
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,580
In fact...

1215
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:42,980
Oh my gosh.

1216
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,400
She donated...

1217
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,700
So much money...

1218
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,740
To a local hospital...

1219
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,600
That...

1220
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:48,820
Okay.

1221
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,900
And she died...

1222
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,540
Uh...

1223
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:50,880
Hold on.

1224
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,800
Winchester...

1225
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:54,000
Sarah.

1226
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,320
Sarah Winchester.

1227
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,880
She died...

1228
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,880
In 1922.

1229
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,180
Okay?

1230
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,220
1922.

1231
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,520
She donated so much money...

1232
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,860
To a local hospital...

1233
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,540
That...

1234
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:06,060
Until just...

1235
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,360
I think it was...

1236
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,000
Twenty...

1237
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,180
It was until just several years ago...

1238
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:13,620
That the hospital was still using the money...

1239
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:14,260
From her donation.

1240
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,780
Is that not insane?

1241
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,740
They were still using money from her...

1242
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,520
Over like a hundred years...

1243
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:24,840
About.

1244
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,160
Is that not insane?

1245
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,540
I was like...

1246
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:31,640
Whoa.

1247
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,320
That's an Akashupa.

1248
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,780
That's a...

1249
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,980
We think you're cool, Sarah Winchester.

1250
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,700
I was like...

1251
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,220
Oh my gosh.

1252
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,680
I...

1253
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,400
I hope she's not still haunting here...

1254
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,200
Because I...

1255
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,140
The lady deserves a rest.

1256
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,440
Oh my gosh.

1257
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,140
It's actually crazy, OMG.

1258
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,680
Ah, it's so insane.

1259
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,120
It's so insane.

1260
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,320
She did.

1261
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:58,660
And...

1262
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:58,940
And...

1263
00:45:58,940 --> 00:45:59,060
Oh!

1264
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,240
And she left...

1265
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,620
She left all of...

1266
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:03,780
The people who worked for her too...

1267
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:04,660
In her will.

1268
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,140
So they all like...

1269
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:07,580
Had decent lives.

1270
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,980
Some of them were like...

1271
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:10,140
Immigrants too and stuff.

1272
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,720
And she still treated everybody fairly.

1273
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,000
I'm just like...

1274
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:13,280
Wow.

1275
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:14,360
Wow.

1276
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,060
Sarah Winchester.

1277
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,060
And after...

1278
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,740
And even...

1279
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:19,960
With all of this...

1280
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,960
I was so impressed.

1281
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,140
I was just like...

1282
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,900
She...

1283
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,720
She...

1284
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,420
Was in such grief...

1285
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,260
And such despair.

1286
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,180
But she like...

1287
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:29,940
Still was...

1288
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:30,480
She didn't...

1289
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:30,700
Like...

1290
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:32,180
She was a very private woman.

1291
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:32,940
But she like...

1292
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,800
Didn't let it...

1293
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:34,320
You know...

1294
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,300
She...

1295
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,380
She didn't let it turn her into like a...

1296
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:37,620
You know...

1297
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:38,500
Into a bad person.

1298
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,820
She was just so nice.

1299
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,160
You know...

1300
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,080
My surgery was a complete success.

1301
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,600
Fred!

1302
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,060
The increased pain from the tumor is gone.

1303
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,360
And the medicine is treating my pain again.

1304
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,900
Wow!

1305
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,120
I'm so happy!

1306
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:50,920
Congrats!

1307
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,240
Yeah!

1308
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,100
She still had the capacity for that much kindness.

1309
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,580
It's crazy.

1310
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,160
I know!

1311
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,560
It was...

1312
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,020
I'm sorry...

1313
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,180
Sorry.

1314
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:02,000
I was like so...

1315
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,300
So genuinely blown away.

1316
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,740
Because all I had heard was all the spooky stories about her house.

1317
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,920
And everything like that.

1318
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:09,680
But...

1319
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:11,680
I was so genuinely blown away.

1320
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:12,760
By...

1321
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:13,760
By her story.

1322
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,520
I was like...

1323
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,080
Oh my gosh.

1324
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,780
I'm sorry.

1325
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,180
I'm sorry.

1326
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,380
Miss Winchester.

1327
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:20,720
I...

1328
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,360
I misjudged you so hard.

1329
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,040
And I feel the world has too!

1330
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,640
Everybody just talks about...

1331
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,360
Everybody just talks about...

1332
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,320
How crazy she was.

1333
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,000
She was awesome!

1334
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:37,020
We were not familiar with her game.

1335
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,020
Yeah!

1336
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,900
It was so...

1337
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,740
I was like...

1338
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:41,960
I...

1339
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,320
I...

1340
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,580
I...

1341
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:44,200
I...

1342
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:44,660
I...

1343
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:44,900
I...

1344
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,400
It was my birthday on Saturdays.

1345
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:46,640
Okay?

1346
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,720
If you sing birthday song with Solid Snake...

1347
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,280
I don't have a Solid Snake voice!

1348
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:51,320
Sorry!

1349
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:51,720
Sorry!

1350
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,180
I think I'm not doing birthday songs for a little bit longer.

1351
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,820
I'm sorry!

1352
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,720
But happy birthday!

1353
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,260
Went to LA expecting to see Minto on stage once...

1354
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,720
But I ended up seeing you three times!

1355
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,980
It was the Kiara concert!

1356
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:07,580
Yeah!

1357
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:11,520
But...

1358
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,400
Yeah!

1359
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,280
So that...

1360
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,540
I did the Winchester house.

1361
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,260
Oh my gosh.

1362
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,660
I was so obsessed with it.

1363
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,720
I have so many pictures.

1364
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,820
I tried to get ghost photography.

1365
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,140
But I think...

1366
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,820
I'm too powerful of a ghost.

1367
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,940
And they were afraid of me.

1368
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,000
Maybe.

1369
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:26,380
Probably.

1370
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,620
Yeah, probably.

1371
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,480
Probably too scared of me.

1372
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,100
And...

1373
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:35,480
Um...

1374
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:35,940
Let's see.

1375
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:39,220
Um...

1376
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:40,840
I...

1377
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,780
What is this?

1378
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,420
Oh yeah, this is Toho.

1379
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:44,860
Okay.

1380
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,420
I'm looking through my photos now.

1381
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,180
This is Toho.

1382
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,040
And...

1383
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,060
Um...

1384
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,480
I went to some idol shows.

1385
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,480
I was talking to a friend.

1386
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,760
I don't remember...

1387
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:00,440
Um...

1388
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,240
Who it was.

1389
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:02,660
But they were like...

1390
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,540
They were like...

1391
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:06,100
It kind of...

1392
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,360
I guess feels like...

1393
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,720
They were explaining...

1394
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,240
They were explaining that I like...

1395
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,840
Maybe it was...

1396
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,980
Might have been Ayami Mama.

1397
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,140
Actually, now that I think about it.

1398
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,060
But she was like...

1399
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,080
She was like...

1400
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,700
Because it was...

1401
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,440
It was...

1402
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,920
I was in Japanese.

1403
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,000
I'm like...

1404
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,200
Who did I talk to about...

1405
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,620
Idols in Japanese with?

1406
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,080
You at an idol show?

1407
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:30,680
Never.

1408
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,500
But, um...

1409
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,980
They were like...

1410
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:42,560
Oh...

1411
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,120
You've been working so hard...

1412
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:44,980
And you still go to...

1413
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,980
You go to idol shows.

1414
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,540
You don't get tired from the idol shows?

1415
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,260
And I was like...

1416
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:48,960
No...

1417
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:49,880
I...

1418
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,060
I feel really refreshed...

1419
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,160
Seeing idols afterwards.

1420
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,380
And they were like...

1421
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:55,600
It's kind of like...

1422
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,420
You know...

1423
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,780
You're kind of like...

1424
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:58,880
A real salaryman.

1425
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:02,960
You're kind of like...

1426
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:03,920
A real salaryman.

1427
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,640
Like the guys that like...

1428
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,980
Work, work, work hard...

1429
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,520
And go out the office...

1430
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,720
And are berated by their bosses...

1431
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,260
And then...

1432
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,580
They go to idol shows...

1433
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,360
To feel...

1434
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,960
To release like...

1435
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,000
Their tension...

1436
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,280
And...

1437
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:18,700
To...

1438
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,980
Um...

1439
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,080
And to...

1440
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:21,700
To...

1441
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:22,420
To be...

1442
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,280
Feel refreshed by...

1443
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,140
Cute...

1444
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,060
Cute girls.

1445
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,180
And I'm like...

1446
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,860
Yeah...

1447
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:31,180
I'm a salaryman...

1448
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,660
Should we berate you more?

1449
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,020
Yeah...

1450
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,440
Hurt me more, chat...

1451
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,780
But I was like...

1452
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,540
I guess it's kind of like a Gretzko, no?

1453
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:45,820
Where...

1454
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,000
Where...

1455
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,560
But instead of karaoke...

1456
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,800
I'm like...

1457
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,140
I'm like yelling mixes and stuff.

1458
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,660
Freaky.

1459
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,520
You were in OL, so it kind of fits.

1460
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,140
Oh, true!

1461
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,360
Nah, I was an office lady...

1462
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:04,220
So I guess...

1463
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,200
I guess...

1464
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,480
I never thought of idols like that...

1465
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,020
For me, though.

1466
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,340
But I guess...

1467
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,640
Inadvertently, I was...

1468
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:12,760
Feeling the stress relief.

1469
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,880
Because I was...

1470
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,620
You know, after the idol show...

1471
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:18,080
I'm always like...

1472
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:21,700
Girl cute!

1473
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,840
Girl...

1474
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,960
On stage...

1475
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:26,780
Girl, work hard!

1476
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,460
I...

1477
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,500
I...

1478
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:30,600
Watch girl...

1479
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,140
They wink at me...

1480
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:32,560
So cute!

1481
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,880
Oh, hello, me...

1482
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
Hi, Kiwawa!

1483
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,340
Hello.

1484
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,600
Speaking of cute girl...

1485
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,100
Speaking of cute girl...

1486
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,880
I can't talk about...

1487
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,780
I wasn't there yet.

1488
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,920
I'm trying to go in order.

1489
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:14,660
Um...

1490
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,380
There are things I tried to do.

1491
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:19,440
Uh...

1492
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,780
Like I tried to go to a festival.

1493
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,200
And it said that there was one happening.

1494
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,920
And I went...

1495
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,440
And there was no festival.

1496
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,900
So I didn't miss our tangents.

1497
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,460
No!

1498
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:33,200
I haven't talked about your birthday yet.

1499
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:35,500
I haven't talked yet.

1500
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,960
Yeah, so I was kind of sad about that.

1501
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:39,660
I was like...

1502
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:40,640
Okay, I want to go see.

1503
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:43,560
I want to go see.

1504
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,000
But there...

1505
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:45,840
There was nothing.

1506
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,120
They lied.

1507
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,160
They did!

1508
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:56,510
I went to the Death Stranding 2 Cafe.

1509
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,390
And that was...

1510
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,050
Was that the thing you got the dates mixed up on?

1511
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:02,350
Oh!

1512
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:03,450
No.

1513
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:05,390
That was actually...

1514
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:10,050
Okay, I can talk about that.

1515
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,270
Since you brought it up.

1516
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:12,390
So I posted...

1517
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,150
I posted on Twitter.

1518
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:14,950
I was just like...

1519
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:15,610
I was...

1520
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,950
I stayed a little...

1521
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:18,010
I stayed a couple days.

1522
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:25,190
I stayed a couple days longer in Japan than I was initially going to.

1523
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,250
Because...

1524
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,170
I was invited to something.

1525
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:32,430
And it was...

1526
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,010
I was invited by...

1527
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:37,470
Certain...

1528
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,330
Demon dog twins.

1529
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,010
To go to...

1530
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,370
Hololive Gamers Fest.

1531
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,180
To go see...

1532
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:49,750
To go watch.

1533
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:53,610
And...

1534
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:56,630
I was actually...

1535
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,770
I was with a mutual friend.

1536
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,630
Who also got invited.

1537
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:01,330
We were...

1538
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,870
We were eating lunch together.

1539
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,430
And then we were going to go to the venue.

1540
00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:06,850
And...

1541
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:08,630
It was going...

1542
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:09,570
There was...

1543
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,290
And it was like an anime moment.

1544
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:14,570
We were...

1545
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:15,730
We were eating lunch.

1546
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:17,210
And then...

1547
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:18,090
Um...

1548
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,110
She was talking...

1549
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,530
To another friend.

1550
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:21,690
Um...

1551
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,390
Who was...

1552
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,050
Who was doing something...

1553
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:25,250
Before the show.

1554
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:26,750
And...

1555
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:28,110
She was like...

1556
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:28,990
Good luck to that friend.

1557
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,730
And the friend said...

1558
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:32,630
Thank you.

1559
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:33,790
But it's tomorrow.

1560
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,210
And...

1561
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,590
And...

1562
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:39,270
My friend looks at me...

1563
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,610
And my friend goes...

1564
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:41,550
Tomorrow?

1565
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,590
And I go...

1566
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:45,310
Tomorrow?

1567
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,350
And...

1568
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,730
And then she goes...

1569
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:55,990
What day...

1570
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,270
Did...

1571
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,530
Did the twins...

1572
00:54:59,530 --> 00:54:59,910
Tell you?

1573
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:01,750
And I was like...

1574
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:02,800
Saturday...

1575
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:03,190
Saturday...

1576
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,390
And then I go through my messages...

1577
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:07,170
And I say...

1578
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,860
July 6th...

1579
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:18,430
But she had also thought...

1580
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,350
It was Saturday...

1581
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:23,370
But she was also told July 6th...

1582
00:55:25,850 --> 00:55:26,550
And...

1583
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,630
We're just sitting there like...

1584
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,630
Uh-oh...

1585
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,610
That's on Sunday...

1586
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:34,190
That's when my flight is...

1587
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,820
Literally...

1588
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,880
Literally, it started...

1589
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,810
When my flight was about to leave...

1590
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:44,960
So...

1591
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,180
So I was like...

1592
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,140
No...

1593
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:48,040
No...

1594
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,890
So...

1595
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:55,970
Yeah...

1596
00:55:56,590 --> 00:55:59,330
I did not get to go to...

1597
00:55:59,330 --> 00:56:00,970
Gamers Festival...

1598
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,060
I...

1599
00:56:03,350 --> 00:56:04,450
I...

1600
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,890
Um...

1601
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:07,790
Which is okay...

1602
00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:12,850
My friend was still able to go...

1603
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:13,810
We were just happy...

1604
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:14,470
Because...

1605
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:15,170
We were...

1606
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:16,430
We were eating lunch...

1607
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:16,890
And then...

1608
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,590
We were like...

1609
00:56:17,590 --> 00:56:18,610
Oh, we'll go right...

1610
00:56:18,610 --> 00:56:19,390
We'll be early...

1611
00:56:19,390 --> 00:56:21,150
But we'll go over to the venue...

1612
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,650
So we can get merch...

1613
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:25,050
And the menu...

1614
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,570
Is Saitama Super Arena...

1615
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:27,090
Which is...

1616
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,830
It's like an hour away...

1617
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:29,530
From...

1618
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:30,290
From...

1619
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,470
Where we were at...

1620
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:31,990
So...

1621
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:33,150
If we had gone...

1622
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:34,570
And then like...

1623
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:36,950
Hi...

1624
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:37,550
Let us in...

1625
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,270
And they're like...

1626
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,750
You are not on the list...

1627
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:41,350
We would have been like...

1628
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:42,270
Uh-oh...

1629
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:48,630
And then traveled a whole hour back...

1630
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:51,630
Wasted two hours of our time...

1631
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:52,470
So instead...

1632
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:52,650
Um...

1633
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,630
She and I just...

1634
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:53,910
Uh...

1635
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:54,710
Hung around...

1636
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,010
Uh...

1637
00:56:57,010 --> 00:56:57,710
And we...

1638
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,410
We...

1639
00:56:58,410 --> 00:56:58,690
We...

1640
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:00,370
But it was very...

1641
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,090
It was a very stupid moment...

1642
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:04,270
It was...

1643
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:07,570
Yeah...

1644
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,730
So that's the event...

1645
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:09,690
I was like...

1646
00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:09,970
Oh...

1647
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:10,510
And...

1648
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:10,870
You know...

1649
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,370
Normally I wouldn't have stayed for it...

1650
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:12,650
But...

1651
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:14,090
Because they had invited...

1652
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:15,590
Me to come and watch...

1653
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,610
I was just like...

1654
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:17,730
Yes, of course...

1655
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:18,650
I will...

1656
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:19,450
I want to...

1657
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:19,710
I...

1658
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,110
I...

1659
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,010
I love them...

1660
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,190
I want to support them...

1661
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:22,750
So...

1662
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:24,530
Mm...

1663
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:25,690
And in the end...

1664
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:26,410
I...

1665
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,650
Stayed a little over in Japan...

1666
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:29,110
For...

1667
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:29,810
For...

1668
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:30,390
Nothing...

1669
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:33,350
Um...

1670
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,170
Yeah...

1671
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,310
It was...

1672
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,270
Silly...

1673
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:39,270
Silly...

1674
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:40,410
Silly...

1675
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:42,970
Silly...

1676
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:44,170
Yeah...

1677
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,390
I felt so dumb though...

1678
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,330
I don't know why...

1679
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,350
I thought Saturday...

1680
00:57:49,350 --> 00:57:50,050
I even...

1681
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:50,890
Planned my...

1682
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:52,110
I think in my brain...

1683
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:54,210
They said July 6th...

1684
00:57:54,210 --> 00:57:55,130
So I was just like...

1685
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:55,950
Okay...

1686
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:57,510
July 6th is...

1687
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:59,350
The date I need to stay until...

1688
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,490
And that's why I...

1689
00:58:00,490 --> 00:58:02,370
Set my return date...

1690
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,190
As July 6th...

1691
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:18,430
So...

1692
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,610
Everybody...

1693
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,250
Double check your dates...

1694
00:58:26,430 --> 00:58:27,510
But also...

1695
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,750
My friend thought it was Saturday too...

1696
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:30,730
So...

1697
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:31,430
So...

1698
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:32,750
We both were very silly...

1699
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:36,990
We were both silly, silly, silly...

1700
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:38,150
Yeah...

1701
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:39,470
Um...

1702
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:39,950
But yeah...

1703
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:40,650
I mentioned the...

1704
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,230
Death Stranding Cafe...

1705
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,790
You know what?

1706
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:43,990
I just realized, you guys...

1707
00:58:43,990 --> 00:58:45,370
I completely forgot to take...

1708
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,950
Photos off of my phone...

1709
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:48,750
To show you guys...

1710
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:50,730
I'm so sorry...

1711
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:52,930
I just realized...

1712
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:55,770
I just realized...

1713
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:57,990
Um...

1714
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,140
Uh...

1715
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,580
Kennedy is Saturday...

1716
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,300
Whoops...

1717
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,260
Oh my god...

1718
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:13,960
That song's a...

1719
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,690
How did I...

1720
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:30,430
Predict the future?

1721
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,420
How did I...

1722
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,620
Predict the future like that?

1723
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:42,780
How?

1724
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:44,100
How...

1725
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,140
How did I...

1726
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,100
How did I do that?

1727
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:47,380
For those who don't understand...

1728
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,340
You should watch the Valentine's Day...

1729
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:49,640
No...

1730
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,600
Was it Valentine's Day?

1731
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,940
April 1st?

1732
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:53,280
Wait...

1733
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:53,960
No...

1734
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:54,240
Yeah...

1735
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:54,680
April...

1736
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,120
April Fool's Day...

1737
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:56,780

1738
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,640
Why did I think Valentine's Day?

1739
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,280
It was April 1st...

1740
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:04,240
Watch the April Fool's...

1741
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,000
Stream...

1742
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,700
That I...

1743
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,900
That I did...

1744
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,300
To understand...

1745
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:10,120
Welcome back, meet up!

1746
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,140
We had an amazing trip...

1747
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,060
It was my birthday last week...

1748
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,380
And now I'm closer to ghost...

1749
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:13,900
Ghost...

1750
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,420
Ghost...

1751
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:15,700
Ghost...

1752
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,320
Happy birthday...

1753
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,200
Happy belated birthday...

1754
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,240
Happy belated birthday...

1755
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,450
I can't believe I wrote an autobiography...

1756
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,760
That's what...

1757
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:27,780
Autobiography, right?

1758
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,420
Is...

1759
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,600
Is the one that's written by the person...

1760
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,260
And the biography is written by another person, right?

1761
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,860
Did you predict the future?

1762
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,120
Or make the future?

1763
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,300
Yeah...

1764
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:40,920
Okay, good...

1765
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:41,840
That's right...

1766
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:42,900
Okay...

1767
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,060
I can't believe I...

1768
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:48,800
Prophecy...

1769
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,220
It's a cuter dude...

1770
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,200
Saturday...

1771
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,600
Whoops...

1772
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,020
Sunday night...

1773
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:55,760
I'm sorry...

1774
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,140
I got the date wrong...

1775
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:00,800
Oh my gosh...

1776
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,200
Yes...

1777
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:02,580
Um...

1778
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:03,680
I made an idol group...

1779
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:04,820
For April Fool's...

1780
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:05,120
And...

1781
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,960
That was their...

1782
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,720
That was their debut song...

1783
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,970
About getting the date wrong...

1784
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:12,460
And I...

1785
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,000
I...

1786
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:34,040
Sorry, I'm snotty now...

1787
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:36,420
Because I'm crying...

1788
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,220
Can you please send your friends...

1789
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:38,380
That's...

1790
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,120
I will...

1791
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,360
I'm gonna send it to her...

1792
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,400
Oh my gosh...

1793
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,580
Let me write a note...

1794
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:45,040
Send...

1795
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,280
Song to...

1796
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,040
To a friend...

1797
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,940
How goofy...

1798
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,720
Minto secret member of Twinkle Dogs...

1799
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,400
Death Stranding Cafe...

1800
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:22,740
Death Stranding Cafe...

1801
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:23,700
My goodness you guys...

1802
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,580
It was...

1803
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,680
Such a strange cafe...

1804
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,460
First of all...

1805
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:29,680
They were playing...

1806
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:32,920
They were playing...

1807
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,850
Metal Gear music...

1808
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:35,680
Which I was like...

1809
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,920
To be fair...

1810
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,120
July 6th is my birthday...

1811
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:40,960
And I thought it was Saturday...

1812
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:41,920
To a co-worker correct...

1813
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,140
Why are we all thinking it's Saturday?

1814
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,040
But also...

1815
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,060
How do I say your name?

1816
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,200
Joke...

1817
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,640
Joke...

1818
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,340
Joke...

1819
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,360
Yo...

1820
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,200
Happy birthday!

1821
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,140
Happy birthday!

1822
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,320
Um...

1823
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,880
The menu was extremely weird for the cafe...

1824
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,360
Like...

1825
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:11,120
Usually...

1826
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,080
For collab cafes like this...

1827
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,200
They kind of have like a...

1828
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,340
Like a...

1829
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:17,940
It's Kojima, what did you expect?

1830
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:19,980
Yeah, but like...

1831
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,180
Usually for collab cafes...

1832
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:22,920
They have a very...

1833
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,300
Like...

1834
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,120
How do I say?

1835
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,880
I don't wanna say boring...

1836
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:29,620
But like...

1837
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,440
A spread of food that like...

1838
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,580
Anybody could eat, you know?

1839
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,620
Did you eat those worm things?

1840
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,720
Ah, I did!

1841
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:39,900
I did eat them...

1842
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:42,880
It's not strict regulations...

1843
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:43,860
I...

1844
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,320
Standard!

1845
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:45,900
Yeah, standard sounds better...

1846
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:49,060
Standard sounds better, yeah...

1847
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,280
Like...

1848
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:51,340
Simple...

1849
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:52,180
Simple, simple...

1850
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:53,640
Predictable...

1851
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,400
Not really predictable...

1852
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:56,500
But it'll be like, you know...

1853
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,300
You'll have like...

1854
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,680
A parfait...

1855
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,840
Or...

1856
01:04:02,460 --> 01:04:03,100
Or...

1857
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,000
Um...

1858
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:05,380
Omurice...

1859
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,120
You know...

1860
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:07,120
Some sort of pancake...

1861
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,300
Things like that...

1862
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:08,880
You know...

1863
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,720
Simple safe...

1864
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,060
Yeah...

1865
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:10,900
Safe...

1866
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:12,400
That's the best word for it...

1867
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,120
Safe...

1868
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:13,760
Yeah...

1869
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,280
Just stuff that like...

1870
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,060
Anybody could kind of...

1871
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:17,920
Enjoy, you know?

1872
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,400
But this...

1873
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,420
This...

1874
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:21,900
Was...

1875
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,400
So crazy...

1876
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,700
Um...

1877
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,500
So they had the...

1878
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,660
Atami pizza...

1879
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:29,120
Pizza...

1880
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:30,160
Atami...

1881
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,400
Pizza...

1882
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,180
And that...

1883
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:32,560
Hold on...

1884
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:34,400
I have the menu pulled up here...

1885
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:36,240
So...

1886
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:37,300
Um...

1887
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,280
A lot of it...

1888
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:38,880
Because of like...

1889
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,920
The time fall...

1890
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:40,960
A lot of it...

1891
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,460
Was like...

1892
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:42,560
Very...

1893
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:43,520
Gooey...

01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:44,900
Black...

1895
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,520
Goopy...

1896
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,300
Like...

1897
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:47,720
The...

1898
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,300
Pizza...

1899
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,340
Was covered in...

1900
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:50,520
Squid Ink...

1901
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,920
Kind of stuff...

1902
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:52,700
And then...

1903
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,660
They had...

1904
01:04:53,660 --> 01:04:54,580
They had...

1905
01:04:54,580 --> 01:04:55,620
A curry...

1906
01:04:55,620 --> 01:04:56,040
Hold on...

1907
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:56,440
Let me see...

1908
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,180
DHV Magellan's curry...

1909
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,680
We've imagined a dish...

1910
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:01,700
Served aboard the...

1911
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:02,780

1912
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:04,440
Sam Porter Bridges Mobile Base...

1913
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,640
This healthy meal features...

1914
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,520
Lean Crocodile...

1915
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,440
And ground chicken from Australia...

1916
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:11,920
Vegetables...

1917
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,440
And bamboo charcoal...

1918
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,080
How?

1919
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,600
Look back, me too!

1920
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:19,340
We miss you!

1921
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,160
Thank you!

1922
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,260
Lean Crocodile?

1923
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,320
I've never seen...

1924
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:30,560
Crocodile served...

1925
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,760
In Japan before...

1926
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,220
Isn't that crazy?

1927
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:37,140
I...

1928
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:37,780
Actually...

1929
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:38,720
I didn't get it...

1930
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,300
I wasn't very hungry...

1931
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:40,700
When I...

1932
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:41,800
When I...

1933
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:42,380
Went...

1934
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,800
And so I was just like...

1935
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:46,160
Maybe I'll come back...

1936
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:47,020
If I have time...

1937
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:47,920
And I'll get the curry...

1938
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:49,200
But I was afraid it was...

1939
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,560
Gonna be spicy...

1940
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,440
But I kind of regret not going to get it...

1941
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,500
Then they had...

1942
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,380
Actually...

1943
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:57,000
Hold on...

1944
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:57,340
You know what?

1945
01:05:57,340 --> 01:05:57,940
I'm just gonna...

1946
01:05:57,940 --> 01:05:58,840
Let me do this...

1947
01:05:58,840 --> 01:05:59,960
I can bring this up...

1948
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:01,140
I can have you guys see this...

1949
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,560
Hold on...

1950
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,520
I'm just gonna see...

1951
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:03,160
Cause...

1952
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:03,720
The...

1953
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:04,160
The...

1954
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,040
The menu...

1955
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,380
Was a Google Drive...

1956
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,400
So I still had it saved...

1957
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:12,840
Hold on...

1958
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,540
I can pull it up...

1959
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,500
I can pull it up...

1960
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,120
And you guys can actually see the pictures...

1961
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:25,220
Okay...

1962
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,060
One second...

1963
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:28,940
Let me zoom in...

1964
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:29,220
Zoom...

1965
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:29,360
Zoom...

1966
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:29,560
Zoom...

1967
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,360
Zoom...

1968
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:40,070
Press the wrong button...

1969
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:40,770
This...

1970
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,910
Window capture...

1971
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:48,270
One moment...

1972
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:49,970
One moment...

1973
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:51,230
Ugh...

1974
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,750
One moment...

1975
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,190
Making it small...

1976
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,080
Okay...

1977
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,320
They had it in English, too, which is pretty nice.

1978
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,460
See?

1979
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,180
I had these.

1980
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,980
The Cryptobiotes.

1981
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,260
I had them.

1982
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:16,080
And they were... So, this one was... regular flavor.

1983
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,660
This one was a salty flavor.

1984
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,480
And then this one was a spicy flavor.

1985
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,700
A spicy, a sparse.

1986
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,960
But they were pretty yummy.

1987
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,200
Because they were... There was a chocolate.

1988
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:29,980
Chocolate.

1989
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,060
On the bottom.

1990
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:32,500
Yeah.

1991
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:33,780
They look so sad.

1992
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:35,340
I know, but they were tasty.

1993
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,140
Yeah, that's pretty good, though.

1994
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,220
And then you can see the pizza.

1995
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,860
And then the curry.

1996
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,460
Everything is so goopy.

1997
01:07:49,680 --> 01:07:51,060
And... Everything.

1998
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,020
And then there was this.

1999
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,040
The tar soup of life.

2000
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,880
Which I'm like, everything is goopy!

2001
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:07,160
Everything is so... Inspired by the in-game line, there's a theory that tar is a type of soup of life.

2002
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:12,060
This dish features a thick, viscous texture.

2003
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,700
It's based on a...

2004
01:08:13,700 --> 01:08:20,160
Rich squid ink sauce packed with vegetables highlighted by tender chunks of spear squid and baby octopus.

2005
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,780
I was like, what is this menu?

2006
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,480
And then there's a vegan version.

2007
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:34,200
And there's the empanada.

2008
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,520
We've imagined a meal served in the DHV Magellan mess hall.

2009
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:46,420
This empanada, a fried pastry from Mexico, contains vegetables, tomato sauce, and our popular wild boar meat.

2010
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,260
We've also added cactus!

2011
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,480
For an extra crispy texture!

2012
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,560
Excuse me!

2013
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:03,000
I wanted to try this one really badly, actually.

2014
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,460
But I was just... Like I said, I was not hungry at all.

2015
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:07,240
So I just went for the dessert.

2016
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,020
Oops, sorry.

2017
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:11,860
I hit my mic.

2018
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,060
I've never had cactus!

2019
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,580
Is it... What is it like?

2020
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:17,760
Is it like a cucumber?

2021
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,640
Or...

2022
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:26,180
Goopy!

2023
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:27,320
Goopy!

2024
01:09:28,780 --> 01:09:30,180
Mmm, gruntry.

2025
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,700
It's juicy.

2026
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:33,720
It's like aloe.

2027
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,640
What a taste in this, though.

2028
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:37,600
Well...

2029
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,060
It's cactus.

2030
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,240
Only drank cactus.

2031
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:49,260
Like cactus!

2032
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,400
The word in Japanese is so cute.

2033
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:53,140
Saboten!

2034
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,180
It's normal in Texas.

2035
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:01,880
I don't think I know cactus was edible.

2036
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,540
Me neither!

2037
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:04,240
Me neither!

2038
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,300
Anyway...

2039
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,660
Um, then the drinks were also kind of strange.

2040
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,980
I actually got this one.

2041
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,660
Even though I cannot have soda.

2042
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,400
But, um...

2043
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,660
Experience Sam's world with Ramane soda.

2044
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,500
Where time fall rains from marshmallows dyed black.

2045
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:25,960
So...

2046
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:28,800
They basically gave you a little cup of marshmallows.

2047
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:31,140
And then you would put it in the top of the drink.

2048
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,220
And it would like...

2049
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:34,740
Slowly drip down...

2050
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,940
Into the drink, turning it black.

2051
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,540
It was pretty cool.

2052
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:38,600
Beautiful!

2053
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:41,540
It also features blue jelly made with...

2054
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,360
Blue...nom on dark.

2055
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:57,380
repairerug��어 purple and red 그런데... Yeh, yeh!

2056
01:10:57,460 --> 01:10:58,420
Yeh, seh, could see it's like...

2057
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:01,820
It's got the little... It's got the tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic tic!

2058
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,740
Curacao... Curacao... Yes.

2059
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,300
I got that one.

2060
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,420
And I struggled.

2061
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:17,840
I would, like, drink a little bit of it and be like, ahhh... And drink it and be like, ahhh... Because I can't have soda.

2062
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,860
But I wanted the straw really badly.

2063
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,280
And then I couldn't get this one.

2064
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:29,220
I couldn't get Higgs drink because this drink captures Higgs' dark and intense essence.

2065
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:37,320
It's tomato juice infused with Tabasco... With chocolate sauce drizzled around the glass.

2066
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,380
I don't think I could have it.

2067
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:41,620
Because it's a Tabasco.

2068
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,200
Bloody Mary!

2069
01:11:52,280 --> 01:11:54,460
She's, like, famous in the ghost world.

2070
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:57,440
Wait, is Bloody Mary this?

2071
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,660
Tomato... Lots of tomato juice... In this menu.

2072
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,020
Bloody Mary... Is it spicy?

2073
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:13,820
Yes, without the chocolate.

2074
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,120
I've been sick since I got back from a con.

2075
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:19,720
Oh, no!

2076
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:21,660
Feel better, Casey.

2077
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:24,160
Thank you.

2078
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,960
Bloody Marys are spicy.

2079
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:28,540
Oh, yeah.

2080
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,780
I couldn't have it.

2081
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:31,420
I couldn't have it.

2082
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,030
But then this one...

2083
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:37,870
I probably should have had this one.

2084
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,830
Now that I think about it.

2085
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,930
But I really wanted the straw... For the picture.

2086
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:47,870
Um, inspired by her emergence from the tar.

2087
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,970
This drink embodies tomorrow's dual nature of cuteness and strength.

2088
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:54,750
Combining dark coffee with yellow fruit juice.

2089
01:12:55,170 --> 01:12:56,290
Actually sounds kind of good.

2090
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,780
I think I would have this one.

2091
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:05,400
Then... There were these as well.

2092
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:06,880
The Bridges energy drink.

2093
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,340
Which I... Which I... Did not get.

2094
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,520
I... Probably was carbonated.

2095
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:12,420
So I couldn't have it.

2096
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,100
But I did try the tea.

2097
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:17,160
And that was yummy.

2098
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,460
That was really good.

2099
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,900
It's, uh...

2100
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:25,120
This one... I still have the can, actually.

2101
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:25,800
I kept it.

2102
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,100
No monster.

2103
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,240
I guess there's no monster this time, huh?

2104
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:33,660
Huh.

2105
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,620
And then I also got the blood bag.

2106
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:37,160
Because...

2107
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,120
I read it.

2108
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,240
I was just like...

2109
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:40,680
I... Okay.

2110
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,280
I read raspberry cranberry.

2111
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,080
And I was like...

2112
01:13:44,780 --> 01:13:45,680
That's for me!

2113
01:13:45,740 --> 01:13:47,820
And I did not read tomato juice.

2114
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,560
And I was... I was drinking it.

2115
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:50,240
And I was like...

2116
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:51,540
Eh.

2117
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,920
I was like...

2118
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,320
Why does this taste like I'm actually drinking blood?

2119
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,160
I felt like a vampire.

2120
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,420
Then I was like...

2121
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:07,440
Eh.

2122
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:08,120
Huh.

2123
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:11,700
Ah, this is a strange taste for raspberry cranberry.

2124
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:15,060
And then I looked it up and I was like, oh...

2125
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,140
Tomato juice.

2126
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,560
And then strawberry jelly adds a fun texture.

2127
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:22,540
And because of the strawberry jelly...

2128
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:25,660
It really felt like so...

2129
01:14:27,140 --> 01:14:27,700
So...

2130
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,680
What's the word?

2131
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,360
Like, kind of congealed?

2132
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,500
Like, it felt...

2133
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,520
Thank you for the rest!

2134
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:40,590
Yeah...

2135
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,630
Like, clumpy...

2136
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:43,790
Yeah, it was...

2137
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:44,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

2138
01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:49,290
It felt actually like I was drinking blood.

2139
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,390
If I were a vampire, I would have been so excited.

2140
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:57,190
Hello Raiders, we're talking about the Death Stranding cafe I went to.

2141
01:14:57,450 --> 01:14:59,630
And how bizarre the menu was.

2142
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:03,710
But like, even for this...

2143
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:05,330
Like, the menu is so strange.

2144
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:06,490
Like...

2145
01:15:06,490 --> 01:15:07,010
There...

2146
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:11,230
You know, I know that Death Stranding is not like a cutesy game or anything like that.

2147
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:15,310
But like, usually there's like a milky drink or something like that, you know?

2148
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,770
It's very interesting.

2149
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:19,390
That this menu is just so...

2150
01:15:20,150 --> 01:15:20,670
Bizarre.

2151
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,770
It's very interesting.

2152
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:26,570
There's a Death Stranding cafe.

2153
01:15:26,830 --> 01:15:26,990
Yeah!

2154
01:15:27,370 --> 01:15:28,090
It's a pop-up!

2155
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,970
It's a pop-up happening right now.

2156
01:15:35,550 --> 01:15:35,950
So...

2157
01:15:38,430 --> 01:15:38,830
Yeah...

2158
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:40,210
This was...

2159
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:41,670
Thank you for all the gift of memberships!

2160
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,310
Thank you guys!

2161
01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:44,050
Thank you Tisumso!

2162
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,070
Thank you Phil!

2163
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:45,830
Thank you Ducky!

2164
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:47,370
Thank you Torgo!

2165
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,170
Thank you!

2166
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:48,950
Thank you!

2167
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:49,310
Thank you very much!

2168
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:50,090
Thank you!

2169
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:51,210
Thank you guys!

2170
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,750
Thank you!

2171
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:01,420
So...

2172
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:03,300
Yeah...

2173
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:04,480
Oh, this is allergies.

2174
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:06,940
Very, very interesting.

2175
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:13,340
The most interesting collaboration cafe I've ever been to.

2176
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,480
I wish I had gone hungry.

2177
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,700
Like, gone to...

2178
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,900
I wish I had gone to the cafe hungry.

2179
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,600
So that I could...

2180
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:23,940
Get actual food.

2181
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:24,820
You know?

2182
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:27,300
Let us read the allergies.

2183
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:27,780
Okay.

2184
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,640
You should make your own menu?

2185
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:31,220
If I hosted a collab...

2186
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:32,700
Metal Gear collab cafe?

2187
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,240
Here, let's see what the allergies are.

2188
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:37,340
Milk.

2189
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,360
Wheat.

2190
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:41,460
Shrimp.

2191
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:42,740
Crap.

2192
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,340
No walnut.

2193
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:47,400
No peanut.

2194
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:49,600
No buckwheat.

2195
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:53,020
Almond.

2196
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:54,820
Almond.

2197
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:55,280
Squid.

2198
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,000
Beef.

2199
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,660
Sesame.

2200
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,560
Orange.

2201
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,100
What?

2202
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:06,700
What was orange in there?

2203
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:08,840
One more.

2204
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:10,280
Soy bean.

2205
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:12,480
Chicken.

2206
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:14,240
Yam.

2207
01:17:15,720 --> 01:17:16,300
Hot.

2208
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,020
Blue blue.

2209
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:19,820
Gelatin.

2210
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:22,260
What is a peach in?

2211
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:23,200
Oh, kiwi.

2212
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,640
Why do they even list things if they're not in there?

2213
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:30,520
Mackerel.

2214
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:32,660
Yeah.

2215
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:38,720
That's the same thing.

2216
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,760
Lots of soy bean.

2217
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:48,720
Hey, there you go.

2218
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:50,480
Those are your allergies.

2219
01:17:53,380 --> 01:17:55,240
So that you know it's accounted for?

2220
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,560
Oh, I guess so.

2221
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:02,020
I guess I didn't know that some of these were...

2222
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:06,620
Such common allergies, such as a peach allergy.

2223
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:09,520
Or...

2224
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:10,620
Um...

2225
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:11,740
Well, walnut...

2226
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:13,080
A nut allergy makes sense.

2227
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,620
Adding the nuts.

2228
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:16,440
Adding the nuts.

2229
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,660
You're allergic to tuna!

2230
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:28,940
It feels weird being allergic to just one fish.

2231
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:29,880
No?

2232
01:18:33,140 --> 01:18:33,820
Mmm...

2233
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,000
That's a lot of nuts!

2234
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,740
I don't think I have any allergies.

2235
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:42,700
Lucky me.

2236
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,480
Lucky me.

2237
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:47,780
Um...

2238
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:50,440
Let's see, what else did I do?

2239
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,100
Went to some more idol shows.

2240
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,520
Um...

2241
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:55,060
I did have...

2242
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:55,560
Oh my gosh.

2243
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:56,420
I did have...

2244
01:18:56,420 --> 01:18:58,240
I did have two...

2245
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,220
Two long days of recording.

2246
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:02,840
And, um...

2247
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:08,500
For those who wonder why I go to Japan to do recording sometimes...

2248
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:09,060
Um...

2249
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:10,120
Not only is it one...

2250
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:14,100
Good to have a Japanese speaker...

2251
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,940
Listen to me recording.

2252
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,720
Because they can help if I get, like, intonation wrong.

2253
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,280
Or...

2254
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,140
And there were some parts where I got...

2255
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,040
The...

2256
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:24,760
The...

2257
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,780
Lyrics completely wrong.

2258
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,420
Because I was reading the wrong kanji.

2259
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:30,660
And so they would correct me.

2260
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:32,440
Um...

2261
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,900
So that's part of the reason why...

2262
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:34,520
Um...

2263
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,620
You'll find people recording in...

2264
01:19:36,620 --> 01:19:38,620
Japan for Japanese songs.

2265
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,600
Yeah, they were like...

2266
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:42,860
Um...

2267
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:43,380
This part!

2268
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,780
Are you sure you read that right?

2269
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:49,560
And I'd be like...

2270
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:55,580
And, uh...

2271
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,160
Another thing.

2272
01:19:57,180 --> 01:20:00,100
High quality studios and services for two buys.

2273
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,260
That was another thing!

2274
01:20:02,120 --> 01:20:02,760
Um...

2275
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:06,060
I got some help with this latest recording.

2276
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,320
And, uh...

2277
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,000
The...

2278
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,940
Sound engineer I worked with...

2279
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,700
Is a Vocaloid producer.

2280
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:14,480
And...

2281
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,020
Um...

2282
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,300
There was someone else there...

2283
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,280
That was, uh...

2284
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,560
Overseeing the recording.

2285
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,260
And...

2286
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:21,200
Um...

2287
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:24,260
And she works for, uh...

2288
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,380
For a place I cannot name.

2289
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,540
And...

2290
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:31,440
Um...

2291
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:32,100
They were like...

2292
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:32,420
Oh yeah!

2293
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,020
If you ever want to work together...

2294
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:35,300
Or...

2295
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:35,860
Things like that.

2296
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,280
Um...

2297
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,320
And they were kind of like...

2298
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,400
Listing off opportunities and things for me.

2299
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,700
Because...

2300
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:45,160
I had...

2301
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,060
Gone and recorded with them.

2302
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,080
Can you say who?

2303
01:20:49,220 --> 01:20:49,660
I cannot.

2304
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:50,740
I'm sorry.

2305
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:51,900
I'm sorry.

2306
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:52,460
I'm sorry!

2307
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:55,720
So...

2308
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:56,840
You know...

2309
01:20:57,480 --> 01:20:58,000
Um...

2310
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,760
Just things like that.

2311
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,600
It's always not just like a...

2312
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,700
I go to Japan because I want to.

2313
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:03,620
But also...

2314
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:04,460
It's another like...

2315
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,640
Way for me to...

2316
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,420
Kind of network.

2317
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,240
And then I also mentioned about...

2318
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:09,900
With, uh...

2319
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:12,420
With the motion capture 3D work...

2320
01:21:12,420 --> 01:21:13,220
And everything like that.

2321
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:14,880
Um...

2322
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,460
I'll be honest.

2323
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,860
I haven't looked so much into...

2324
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,820
Finding studios...

2325
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,720
In...

2326
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:20,520
The West.

2327
01:21:21,980 --> 01:21:22,500
But...

2328
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:25,520
Uh...

2329
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,860
Finding...

2330
01:21:26,860 --> 01:21:27,580
Studios...

2331
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:28,740
That will work with VTubers...

2332
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:29,560
And understand...

2333
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:31,820
How VTubers work...

2334
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:32,500
And understand...

2335
01:21:33,020 --> 01:21:34,120
Kind of what...

2336
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:35,740
VTubers are wanting...

2337
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,620
Is way, way, way easier...

2338
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,300
Way, way, way easier...

2339
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:40,720
Way, way, way easier...

2340
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:41,980
In...

2341
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,800
Japan...

2342
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,540
So...

2343
01:21:46,960 --> 01:21:47,600
Uh...

2344
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:48,260
So...

2345
01:21:48,260 --> 01:21:48,920
Uh...

2346
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:49,420
You know...

2347
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:50,720
It is a bit of a hassle...

2348
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:52,320
To have to travel over there...

2349
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,820
To do anything...

2350
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:54,940
But...

2351
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,000
Um...

2352
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:58,460
It...

2353
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,140
Uh...

2354
01:21:59,140 --> 01:21:59,700
I work...

2355
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:01,240
I was able to work at...

2356
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,640
A really, really, really...

2357
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,620
Really good studio...

2358
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:04,980
So...

2359
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:05,840
Um...

2360
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,120
It should...

2361
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,320
It should...

2362
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:09,140
Be good.

2363
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,900
Does that industry service...

2364
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:13,140
Not exist in America at all?

2365
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:14,080
Uh...

2366
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,340
I have...

2367
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:17,080
I have recorded at some...

2368
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:18,880
Uh...

2369
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,460
Uh...

2370
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:20,400
At a...

2371
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:20,880
At...

2372
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:22,060
At...

2373
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:25,220
Potion Capture in America before, yes.

2374
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:27,320
But...

2375
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:32,740
Um...

2376
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:33,060
Um...

2377
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,120
If there...

2378
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,000
Even if there's like...

2379
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:35,880
So...

2380
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,160
Say there's...

2381
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:37,920
Say there's...

2382
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:40,460
The one that I worked with, right?

2383
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,080
If there's...

2384
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:45,640
If every VTuber tries to work with them...

2385
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,140
Then it will be much harder to book them.

2386
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:47,660
You know what I mean?

2387
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:50,440
What about...

2388
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:50,840
Doobie?

2389
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:53,800
I would feel so...

2390
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:54,800
I would...

2391
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,320
I...

2392
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,640
I would feel...

2393
01:22:57,980 --> 01:22:58,940
So bad...

2394
01:22:58,940 --> 01:22:59,360
To...

2395
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,640
Ask her if I could ever...

2396
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:02,940
If I...

2397
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:03,180
If I...

2398
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,960
Hey Doobie, can I come crash at your place?

2399
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:10,700
And use all your equipment and everything for free?

2400
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,880
And use all your equipment and everything for free?

2401
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,480
Yeah, so...

2402
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,280
Hmm...

2403
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,440
But also...

2404
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:22,820
Um...

2405
01:23:22,820 --> 01:23:23,540
Like...

2406
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:24,120
Uh...

2407
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,680
Obviously there's different levels of...

2408
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:27,600
Of...

2409
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:27,920
Uh...

2410
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:28,860
Studios...

2411
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:29,740
Like...

2412
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,140
In terms of...

2413
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:31,800
Um...

2414
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:32,660
Their equipment...

2415
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:33,520
And...

2416
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,020
Cameras and stuff like that.

2417
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:35,880
The numbers of...

2418
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,120
Things that they got going on.

2419
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:38,760
So...

2420
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,360
Um...

2421
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:42,480
Uh...

2422
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:43,500
You know...

2423
01:23:43,500 --> 01:23:44,460
The one that...

2424
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,480
I worked with in the US...

2425
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,060
Um...

2426
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:47,740
It was still...

2427
01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:48,500
Great and all...

2428
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:48,840
But...

2429
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,900
The ones that I work at in Japan usually...

2430
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:51,400
Have...

2431
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,160
More...

2432
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,260
Ability...

2433
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:54,140
And more tech...

2434
01:23:54,140 --> 01:23:55,240
More...

2435
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:55,660
What's the word?

2436
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:57,940
More...

2437
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:58,780
Techno...

2438
01:23:58,780 --> 01:23:59,200
Tec...

2439
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,040
More...

2440
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:01,280
Uh...

2441
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:02,860
Why can't I speak?

2442
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:04,640
More...

2443
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:07,540
Um...

2444
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:09,300
I said it before!

2445
01:24:10,780 --> 01:24:11,340
More...

2446
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:12,560
Capabilities...

2447
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:13,040
Yeah...

2448
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,180
I guess that's the word to say.

2449
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,060
More...

2450
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:15,700
Technical...

2451
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:16,580
Capabilities...

2452
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:17,120
Damn it too!

2453
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:19,500
Thank you!

2454
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,480
Thank you!

2455
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:20,920
Welcome back Minto!

2456
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,140
It was great meeting you at Alphcon...

2457
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:24,000
With the Minto Republic flag...

2458
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,720
You made a birthday...

2459
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,360
Weekend extra special and memorable...

2460
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:27,700
Calicus!

2461
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:28,940
Thank you!

2462
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,140
Happy birthday!

2463
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:34,160
More services features?

2464
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,300
Yeah, I guess so...

2465
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:37,340
Hmm...

2466
01:24:37,340 --> 01:24:37,940
Yeah...

2467
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:38,560
So...

2468
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:40,520
You know...

2469
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:42,320
There's...

2470
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:43,000
There's...

2471
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,400
That kind of stuff...

2472
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:46,400
Yeah...

2473
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,740
It's all...

2474
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,400
It's all...

2475
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:48,700
You know...

2476
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:51,340
Obviously I'm always wanting to stream...

2477
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,640
At the same time...

2478
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:55,300
I gotta go do some networking things too...

2479
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,540
I gotta...

2480
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:00,280
I gotta do my best to meet people...

2481
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:01,460
And make a good rep...

2482
01:25:01,980 --> 01:25:03,300
So that I can...

2483
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,800
Hopefully get more opportunities in the future...

2484
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:08,520
Yeah...

2485
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:08,840
Yeah...

2486
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:09,520
Yeah...

2487
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,140
Yeah...

2488
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:11,620
Yeah...

2489
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:11,840
Yeah...

2490
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,640
She's gotta be social...

2491
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:18,140
I don't wanna be social...

2492
01:25:18,140 --> 01:25:19,800
But I've been quite social recently...

2493
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,830
You guys might have seen...

2494
01:25:21,830 --> 01:25:24,530
Me tweet about...

2495
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:27,270
Um...

2496
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:28,730
About...

2497
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:30,450
Uh...

2498
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,830
Meeting a certain...

2499
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:33,870
Well she already...

2500
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:34,450
She actually...

2501
01:25:34,450 --> 01:25:34,870
She...

2502
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:35,970
She tweeted about it too...

2503
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,850
I met Nerissa...

2504
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:39,530
It was...

2505
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:40,330
Oh my gosh...

2506
01:25:40,330 --> 01:25:41,070
I felt so bad...

2507
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:41,950
Because it was such a...

2508
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:42,510
It was...

2509
01:25:42,510 --> 01:25:43,150
Uh...

2510
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:44,150
After one of...

2511
01:25:44,150 --> 01:25:45,550
My recording days...

2512
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,730
And she was also...

2513
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,270
Busy that day...

2514
01:25:49,270 --> 01:25:49,890
And so we were like...

2515
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:50,410
Let me...

2516
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:51,510
For dinner...

2517
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,530
We'll meet for dinner...

2518
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:56,730
So...

2519
01:25:57,950 --> 01:25:58,630
Um...

2520
01:25:58,630 --> 01:25:59,810
She and I...

2521
01:26:00,170 --> 01:26:00,510
Uh...

2522
01:26:00,510 --> 01:26:01,170
Oh my gosh...

2523
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:02,750
She and I are extremely similar...

2524
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,110
First of all...

2525
01:26:04,110 --> 01:26:05,270
She would like something...

2526
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:06,870
And I would be like...

2527
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,590
I love that thing too...

2528
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:09,410
Hot pot...

2529
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:09,890
How'd you know?

2530
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:11,150
We got hot pot...

2531
01:26:11,150 --> 01:26:12,610
Did she talk about it?

2532
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:14,490
No...

2533
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:16,230
We went and got hot pot together...

2534
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:17,190
And I would be like...

2535
01:26:17,190 --> 01:26:17,970
Sorry Nerissa...

2536
01:26:17,970 --> 01:26:19,190
I don't like mushrooms...

2537
01:26:19,190 --> 01:26:20,250
You can have all the mushrooms...

2538
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:21,250
And she'd be like...

2539
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:23,150
I don't like mushrooms...

2540
01:26:24,770 --> 01:26:25,670
Oh my gosh...

2541
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:27,170
I was such a passenger princess...

2542
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:28,430
With her though...

2543
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:29,510
She...

2544
01:26:30,390 --> 01:26:30,830
She...

2545
01:26:32,530 --> 01:26:33,370
First of all...

2546
01:26:33,370 --> 01:26:34,050
She was like...

2547
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:34,870
She was...

2548
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:36,470
She was like...

2549
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:37,150
She was like...

2550
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:39,690
First, we were going to try and get Yakiniku...

2551
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:41,810
We were going to try and get Yakiniku...

2552
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:42,330
And then...

2553
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,750
We couldn't find a spot...

2554
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:45,470
Which...

2555
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:46,410
I think, we just...

2556
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,250
Didn't look hard enough...

2557
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:47,990
We were tired...

2558
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:48,130
Okay?

2559
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:49,330
But she was just like...

2560
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,130
I know...

2561
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:50,190
I know...

2562
01:26:50,190 --> 01:26:50,750
A good...

2563
01:26:51,570 --> 01:26:53,670
I know a good hotpot spot.

2564
01:26:55,290 --> 01:26:58,410
And she was like, I don't know how much you watch my streams, but...

2565
01:26:58,410 --> 01:27:00,990
But I have seen her streams with the hotpot.

2566
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:08,270
Like, I've seen her where she'll be like, let's make hotpot together.

2567
01:27:10,510 --> 01:27:11,750
Kiara hates mushrooms too.

2568
01:27:11,890 --> 01:27:14,970
Kiara and I, we hate the same... the... the hormon.

2569
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:21,510
We do not like that of the... of... of... of meat.

2570
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,510
So, when we would... we actually...

2571
01:27:25,190 --> 01:27:28,370
What did... I think Kiwawa and I, we went and got...

2572
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:29,790
Yakiniku together.

2573
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:34,370
So, she's your type.

2574
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:35,210
Me?

2575
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:37,550
Am I my own type?

2576
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:39,590
Welcome back, Minto.

2577
01:27:39,670 --> 01:27:40,210
I miss you a lot.

2578
01:27:40,330 --> 01:27:42,970
I'm proud of you for being social and taking part in so much cool stuff.

2579
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:44,250
Thank you!

2580
01:27:46,630 --> 01:27:51,210
Me and Nerissa, she would say something that she likes something and I'd be like, I like that.

2581
01:27:51,210 --> 01:27:53,410
And I'd be like, sorry, I don't like this.

2582
01:27:53,490 --> 01:27:55,290
And she'd be like, I don't like that.

2583
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:57,390
And so, we just really...

2584
01:27:58,670 --> 01:27:59,270
Uh...

2585
01:27:59,270 --> 01:28:00,210
We just really...

2586
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:01,590
bonded well.

2587
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:06,210
And then we were walking around afterwards because we ate so stinking much.

2588
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:07,790
We ate so much.

2589
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:10,550
I watched her double fist two bowls of ice cream.

2590
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,740
Like, she got two and...

2591
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:29,720
She got two different bowls of ice cream and then have one spoon for one and the other spoon for the other.

2592
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:30,820
And...

2593
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:31,840
And...

2594
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:31,920
And...

2595
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:32,100
And...

2596
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,910
And...

2597
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:40,710
She was...

2598
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,060
She's so awesome.

2599
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:47,940
What a woman.

2600
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:48,960
And...

2601
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,330
After we held hands and we walked around while...

2602
01:28:56,050 --> 01:28:56,610
We...

2603
01:28:56,610 --> 01:28:58,490
While we let our food...

2604
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:59,470
Go down.

2605
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,430
I was talking about Nerissa being your type, Minto.

2606
01:29:03,590 --> 01:29:04,670
Yeah, she's my type.

2607
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:08,730
What a woman indeed.

2608
01:29:10,890 --> 01:29:12,350
She was so cute.

2609
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:15,490
Yeah, I loved hanging out with her.

2610
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:16,290
And...

2611
01:29:16,290 --> 01:29:17,750
I wish we could've hung out for longer.

2612
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:18,190
I was...

2613
01:29:18,190 --> 01:29:18,790
I felt so bad.

2614
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:20,430
I was yawning so much by the end.

2615
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:21,130
We could've...

2616
01:29:21,130 --> 01:29:21,630
Oh no!

2617
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,390
I mentioned yawn!

2618
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:24,630
Okay, the yawn went away.

2619
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:25,330
Anyway...

2620
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:25,730
I...

2621
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:32,720
We...

2622
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:36,520
We had a lot of fun just chit-chatting and hanging out.

2623
01:29:36,980 --> 01:29:37,380
So...

2624
01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:39,700
I hope we can collab...

2625
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:41,180
Soon.

2626
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:43,380
I would like to.

2627
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:43,980
With her.

2628
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:46,340
Yeah.

2629
01:29:48,680 --> 01:29:49,540
You made me yawn.

2630
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:50,020
Oh no!

2631
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:52,860
Don't say yawn!

2632
01:29:54,280 --> 01:29:55,340
Okay, I yawn.

2633
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:56,520
Sorry.

2634
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:00,960
I yawn.

2635
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:01,480
Sorry.

2636
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,480
Off collab karaoke.

2637
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:06,680
Oh my gosh.

2638
01:30:07,020 --> 01:30:09,140
I would not be able to sing even one bit.

2639
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:10,580
I would just be listening to her.

2640
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:12,180
I would be like...

2641
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:13,280
Sing it again, Nerissa!

2642
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,200
A-c-o-t-t-o-jo!

2643
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:16,480
H-O-t-t-o-jo!

2644
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:20,560
Sing it again!

2645
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,460
You can't take me hard to go!

2646
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,380
Again!

2647
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:27,440
Again...

2648
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,800
it would be so fun.

2649
01:30:40,380 --> 01:31:00,260
I got to meet Narissa and with Kiwawa's... With Kiwawa's birthday... I actually ended up getting there so early... And I was able to meet... To JP Hollow Man...

2650
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:11,240
I got to meet, um... Nenechi... Yeah... She was very cute.

2651
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:13,680
I mean, they're all... Of course, they're all... They're all so cute!

2652
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:17,540
I was like... I... I could barely talk.

2653
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:18,540
I felt so nervous.

2654
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:26,580
I was like... Oh, wait.

2655
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:27,560
Did you guys see?

2656
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,800
I guess you maybe didn't see...

2657
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:30,980
If you are not... Hold on.

2658
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,500
If you are not on... Oh.

2659
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:34,660
Wait.

2660
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:39,120
If you are not on Twitter... Hold on.

2661
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:46,520
Uh... Hold on.

2662
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:47,300
One moment.

2663
01:31:47,980 --> 01:31:49,240
I'm pulling up the picture.

2664
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:52,620
What the?

2665
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:56,320
I was like... Why is it so zoomed in?

2666
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:57,440
I zoomed in for the menu.

2667
01:32:09,790 --> 01:32:10,290
Oh, wait.

2668
01:32:10,430 --> 01:32:10,570
Oh.

2669
01:32:10,770 --> 01:32:10,910
Oh.

2670
01:32:11,010 --> 01:32:12,070
I was like... What's happening?

2671
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:12,690
There we go.

2672
01:32:12,810 --> 01:32:12,950
Okay.

2673
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:14,690
One second.

2674
01:32:14,890 --> 01:32:14,990
One second.

2675
01:32:14,990 --> 01:32:15,570
I'm saving it.

2676
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:20,130
I'm saving it from... From Twitter.

2677
01:32:20,850 --> 01:32:22,590
But my computer was being weird.

2678
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:31,170
You guys, my computer... Does not like... My computer does not like... Blue Archive.

2679
01:32:31,490 --> 01:32:32,350
It crashes.

2680
01:32:33,190 --> 01:32:34,310
I'm so sad.

2681
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,930
I don't think I can... Never stream Blue Archive.

2682
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,310
Because it crashes every time.

2683
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:40,590
Is that happening to anybody else?

2684
01:32:44,990 --> 01:32:46,290
The Steam client?

2685
01:32:46,530 --> 01:32:46,630
Yeah.

2686
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:47,970
The Steam version.

2687
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:49,890
Is it like horses?

2688
01:32:50,070 --> 01:32:50,890
I haven't tried yet.

2689
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:53,470
I kind of want to play Uma on my phone though.

2690
01:32:54,710 --> 01:32:55,030
Hmm.

2691
01:32:59,120 --> 01:32:59,360
No.

2692
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:01,140
It's something with my graphics card.

2693
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,420
It like... Crashes my graphics card.

2694
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:06,520
Oh.

2695
01:33:06,740 --> 01:33:07,440
Here's the picture.

2696
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,820
Da-da!

2697
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,220
You can see... Kibawa's... Really big signature... Right there.

2698
01:33:13,460 --> 01:33:16,080
And I think... To the right of it... You see that little... Black line?

2699
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,800
I think that's... Calliope's signature.

2700
01:33:18,180 --> 01:33:20,220
And I'm smack dab... In the middle of it.

2701
01:33:22,660 --> 01:33:28,000
And... I got to sign the... The... Hollow Life... Wall.

2702
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:28,740
Oh.

2703
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,500
I said... I met Nenechi.

2704
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,960
I also got to meet... Iroha.

2705
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,240
So it was very... They were very nice.

2706
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:38,080
And I was nervous.

2707
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:40,180
But yeah.

2708
01:33:40,540 --> 01:33:41,900
I got to sign the wall.

2709
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:49,640
There... There... There's me.

2710
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,500
I tried to sign it.

2711
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:52,100
Not so big.

2712
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,100
I was like... Oh.

2713
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:55,180
Oh.

2714
01:33:55,980 --> 01:33:56,460
Oh.

2715
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:57,180
Oh.

2716
01:33:57,180 --> 01:33:57,220
Ah.

2717
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:57,740
Ah.

2718
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:00,200
I don't think I should be here.

2719
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:03,220
I... First I was... It wasn't even my idea.

2720
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:05,020
Like... Kiara was just like...

2721
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:07,160
You should... You should... You should sign the wall.

2722
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:08,820
And I was like... Um.

2723
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:09,620
What?

2724
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:10,580
Ah.

2725
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:11,640
Is it?

2726
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:12,480
Ah.

2727
01:34:12,780 --> 01:34:13,880
And they were like... Yeah.

2728
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:14,340
Of course.

2729
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:15,700
Other people have signed the wall.

2730
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,320
Don't worry.

2731
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:19,180
Did you meet any of the managers?

2732
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,680
I met a lot of managers actually.

2733
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:21,000
Yeah.

2734
01:34:22,140 --> 01:34:22,580
Um.

2735
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:26,920
So.

2736
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:28,740
I was like... Ah.

2737
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:29,600
Ah.

2738
01:34:30,860 --> 01:34:34,480
And then they... They had to bring out... Like a ladder for me.

2739
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:34,760
Ah.

2740
01:34:35,640 --> 01:34:36,160

Ah A member.

2850
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,140
I felt so bad.

2851
01:35:05,940 --> 01:35:09,900
I was like, I don't think I should be here.

2852
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:16,970
But they were all very nice.

2853
01:35:18,250 --> 01:35:21,690
All the staff, they were very, very, very accommodating.

2854
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:25,630
And they even got us ice cream.

2855
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:31,190
And I got to eat a bento and ice cream.

2856
01:35:31,390 --> 01:35:32,070
And I was like, wow.

2857
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:34,590
Such service.

2858
01:35:35,090 --> 01:35:36,450
This is so fancy.

2859
01:35:36,750 --> 01:35:37,710
This is so nice.

2860
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:44,680
I'm just a guest.

2861
01:35:45,060 --> 01:35:45,980
I'm just a guest.

2862
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,720
So, did you double fist it?

2863
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:51,520
I should've.

2864
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,660
I should've.

2865
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,520
I'm going to double fist all ice cream from now on.

2866
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:58,060
In honor of Nerissa.

2867
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:04,180
You're a special guest.

2868
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:06,680
I don't know.

2869
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,760
I don't know.

2870
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,580
I was so nervous.

2871
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,140
First of all, I was so nervous.

2872
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,620
And when Kiara was like, oh, you're my first outside guest.

2873
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,240
I just... I don't know.

2874
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:24,500
I don't deserve that honor.

2875
01:36:24,500 --> 01:36:26,780
I don't deserve... I... I... I... I... I just...

2876
01:36:26,780 --> 01:36:28,300
That is too...

2877
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:29,740
That's too...

2878
01:36:29,740 --> 01:36:31,840
High of honor for little old me.

2879
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:33,300
So...

2880
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:36,240
I was just...

2881
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,620
Uh...

2882
01:36:37,620 --> 01:36:38,960
You're a super...

2883
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:39,720
I am!

2884
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,180
Sounds like things are coming together rather nicely.

2885
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:43,700
Good job.

2886
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:44,340
Welcome back.

2887
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:45,080
Thank you!

2888
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:46,500
Thank you, thank you.

2889
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,520
But it was a lot of fun.

2890
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:59,280
I actually got to go to the studio twice.

2891
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:08,000
Because the first time was for... We were doing dance practice and stuff.

2892
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,460
So... That was nice.

2893
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,680
In the end...

2894
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:21,320
Kiara and I... We've dance practice and then... We just sat on the ground and talked for like... An hour and a half.

2895
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,080
So... It was good.

2896
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:28,200
It was a lot of fun.

2897
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,380
Yeah... And she was... Vector Song!

2898
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:42,140
Thank you so much for the... They deserve the world meat though.

2899
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:42,440
No!

2900
01:37:44,020 --> 01:37:44,540
No!

2901
01:37:45,240 --> 01:37:46,900
I feel deserving bozo.

2902
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:47,360
No!

2903
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,800
I just... I don't know.

2904
01:37:51,940 --> 01:37:55,460
I don't know!

2905
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,180
I am just little old me.

2906
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:03,740
Okay?

2907
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:08,340
I'm just little old me.

2908
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:18,040
Yeah, I was really, really... I was also so nervous... During Kiara's...

2909
01:38:18,040 --> 01:38:18,600
Live?

2910
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,580
I forgot to say happy birthday to her!

2911
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:23,640
I forgot!

2912
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:31,860
I was just like... Oh, but after... Afterwards... When I was watching it... I was just like... Oh my gosh... I... I'm an idiot!

2913
01:38:37,110 --> 01:38:38,750
I was like... No way!

2914
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:41,910
I forgot to say that... I was so... Panicked!

2915
01:38:41,950 --> 01:38:45,350
I forgot to even say the thing... The reason I'm there!

2916
01:38:50,130 --> 01:39:11,690
It was silly though... And... And during the credits... I saw people... Clipping... The... Me and Kiara were like... Swaying back and forth together... We were... There was no audio obviously... But we were like... Singing Titanic... And then I don't know why... I kissed her feet... Something probably possessed me... Oh...

2917
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:23,230
I don't know why... I don't know... I don't know... I

2918
01:39:32,280 --> 01:39:43,220
don't know... I don't remember... Yeah... But... It was a lot of fun...

2919
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:45,920
Oh... Thank you for this internet tie!

2920
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:46,580
Thank you!

2921
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:47,860
Thank you!

2922
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:49,780
Freaky... Freaky, Freaky.

2923
01:39:49,780 --> 01:39:51,480
Freak fandom strikes again...

2924
01:39:58,720 --> 01:39:59,960
Review on the feet?

2925
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:02,360
10 out of 10?

2926
01:40:02,540 --> 01:40:03,260
What else can I say?

2927
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:05,540
What else can I say?

2928
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:09,040
Well, yeah... Like I said... It was just really...

2929
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,760
Big honor to...

2930
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,280
Even be... at the studio at all...

2931
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:25,320
You know, like, I kind of mentioned that I was... I was role-playing that day as like a... We were like... But we were just joking about it the whole time.

2932
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:29,840
Like, oh my gosh, this is... This is if you had gotten into Hololive.

2933
01:40:30,660 --> 01:40:34,680
I'm just like... It was my role-play.

2934
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:37,920
I'm getting ice cream at the Hololive studio.

2935
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:45,520
Getting... Getting ice cream and bento at the Hololive studio.

2936
01:40:45,740 --> 01:40:49,740
Pretending I'm... I was like, oh, this is what Hololive members feel like, huh?

2937
01:40:54,410 --> 01:40:55,410
But it was fine.

2938
01:40:56,430 --> 01:40:58,550
A wild alternate reality.

2939
01:40:58,790 --> 01:40:59,210
Truly.

2940
01:41:00,730 --> 01:41:01,250
Truly.

2941
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:02,870
Um, yeah.

2942
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:06,930
But, like I said, they were all very nice.

2943
01:41:07,090 --> 01:41:09,270
I'm very, very honored that they...

2944
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:10,710
Allowed me it through their doors.

2945
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:12,250
And that I don't have a restraining order.

2946
01:41:13,850 --> 01:41:14,530
Oh.

2947
01:41:15,110 --> 01:41:16,470
And, uh...

2948
01:41:16,470 --> 01:41:18,230
Of course, I did fantastic reality.

2949
01:41:19,750 --> 01:41:22,370
And that was so, so much fun.

2950
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:23,610
Oh my gosh.

2951
01:41:24,730 --> 01:41:26,750
It was really nerve-wracking.

2952
01:41:27,250 --> 01:41:28,630
With the live band.

2953
01:41:29,730 --> 01:41:30,050
Hmm.

2954
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:34,930
Um.

2955
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:37,430
You were great.

2956
01:41:37,910 --> 01:41:38,650
Thank you!

2957
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:40,950
It was...

2958
01:41:40,950 --> 01:41:41,050
It was...

2959
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:41,490
Oh my gosh.

2960
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:42,990
It was...

2961
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:44,110
I saw some clips.

2962
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:45,070
Oh, I can show.

2963
01:41:45,230 --> 01:41:46,750
I have a recording for those.

2964
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:47,330
This is...

2965
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:49,770
I think they're going to try and put out...

2966
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:52,830
Uh...

2967
01:41:54,170 --> 01:41:55,530
Sorry, I'm sucking on a...

2968
01:41:55,530 --> 01:41:55,990
A mint.

2969
01:41:56,970 --> 01:41:58,590
A little bit of a...

2970
01:41:58,590 --> 01:41:58,950
A throat...

2971
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:59,610
A throat mint.

2972
01:42:00,570 --> 01:42:01,050
Um.

2973
01:42:01,650 --> 01:42:03,670
I think they're gonna try and put out like a...

2974
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,790
A VOD or something for it.

2975
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:07,310
Since, uh...

2976
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:10,230
Since...

2977
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:11,350
Um...

2978
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,790
They...

2979
01:42:11,790 --> 01:42:13,070
Couldn't stream it.

2980
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:15,330
A throat mint.

2981
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:16,970
Yeah.

2982
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:18,930
It's, uh...

2983
01:42:18,930 --> 01:42:19,690
Mintia voice.

2984
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:21,870
These ones are so good.

2985
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:22,490
Anyway.

2986
01:42:23,450 --> 01:42:23,690
Um.

2987
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:24,870
Hopefully this isn't...

2988
01:42:24,870 --> 01:42:25,170
Hold on.

2989
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:26,450
I'm gonna try and...

2990
01:42:26,450 --> 01:42:28,790
I don't want it to blast your ears out.

2991
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:30,530
Okay, hold on.

2992
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:31,970
Wait.

2993
01:42:32,530 --> 01:42:32,930
Wait.

2994
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:33,790
Oh, wait.

2995
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:34,570
Wait.

2996
01:42:36,290 --> 01:42:36,930
Wait!

2997
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:37,690
Wait!

2998
01:42:37,690 --> 01:42:37,930
Wait!

2999
01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:40,190
Wait just a second.

3000
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:42,730
It's gonna be really loud.

3001
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:43,810
Is that okay?

3002
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:44,170
Hold on.

3003
01:42:44,290 --> 01:42:44,350
Actually.

3004
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:44,990
Wait.

3005
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:45,830
No, that won't work.

3006
01:42:46,170 --> 01:42:46,430
Um.

3007
01:42:48,890 --> 01:42:50,030
We can take it.

3008
01:42:51,570 --> 01:42:53,690
Okay, I'll blast your ears out for like two seconds.

3009
01:42:53,870 --> 01:42:54,070
All right?

3010
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:55,610
This is your warning.

3011
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:57,470
This is your warning.

3012
01:42:57,650 --> 01:42:58,430
This is your warning.

3013
01:42:58,830 --> 01:43:00,390
Okay, I'm gonna put it on in...

3014
01:43:00,390 --> 01:43:01,230
Three.

3015
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:02,130
Two.

3016
01:43:02,690 --> 01:43:03,110
One.

3017
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:03,810
Wow.

3018
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:06,990
Okay, there we go.

3019
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:08,190
Wait, I wanna hear it too.

3020
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:09,650
Wait.

3021
01:43:09,830 --> 01:43:10,050
Wait.

3022
01:43:10,310 --> 01:43:11,370
I can't hear it.

3023
01:43:17,130 --> 01:43:17,810
Oh gosh.

3024
01:43:17,930 --> 01:43:18,830
I don't like hearing myself.

3025
01:43:18,990 --> 01:43:19,130
Wait.

3026
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:20,290
Why did I wanna hear it?

3027
01:43:23,810 --> 01:43:24,650
And then...

3028
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:25,830
Okay, so I sang this song.

3029
01:43:26,110 --> 01:43:26,450
Right?

3030
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:28,930
Waya Waya Wah by Asaka.

3031
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,250
My favorite Ani song singer.

3032
01:43:32,210 --> 01:43:32,750
Ja, ja.

3033
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:34,690
And...

3034
01:43:35,750 --> 01:43:37,330
I tweeted about this.

3035
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,110
This morning.

3036
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,430
I woke up.

3037
01:43:43,910 --> 01:43:45,790
And I'm on my phone a little bit.

3038
01:43:47,810 --> 01:43:48,970
And then...

3039
01:43:49,970 --> 01:43:51,750
And then Asaka...

3040
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:54,170
I get a note of that.

3041
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:55,830
Asaka follows...

3042
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:57,170
She followed me.

3043
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:58,530
And then...

3044
01:43:58,530 --> 01:43:59,570
And then...

3045
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:00,910
And then...

3046
01:44:00,910 --> 01:44:01,910
She...

3047
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:02,570
She...

3048
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,870
She tweeted at me.

3049
01:44:04,050 --> 01:44:05,170
She said, let's...

3050
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:05,870
Collab.

3051
01:44:07,850 --> 01:44:09,490
She said, let's collab.

3052
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:09,990
Promise.

3053
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,370
From Asaka.

3054
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:12,850
Okay.

3055
01:44:13,070 --> 01:44:14,590
The craziest thing also too.

3056
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:18,110
The night after...

3057
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:19,210
This concert.

3058
01:44:20,370 --> 01:44:21,450
The night...

3059
01:44:21,450 --> 01:44:22,670
The day after this concert.

3060
01:44:23,250 --> 01:44:23,890
I...

3061
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:24,330
Yeah.

3062
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:25,050
The night after.

3063
01:44:25,210 --> 01:44:26,290
I went to...

3064
01:44:26,290 --> 01:44:27,130
An idol show.

3065
01:44:27,930 --> 01:44:28,570
And...

3066
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:29,710
I went with my friend.

3067
01:44:30,450 --> 01:44:31,090
And...

3068
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:33,250
Um...

3069
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:34,330
They were doing cover songs.

3070
01:44:35,830 --> 01:44:36,870
And suddenly...

3071
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,410
I hear...

3072
01:44:40,170 --> 01:44:40,690
Oh.

3073
01:44:45,700 --> 01:44:46,180
Day!

3074
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,080
At the idol show!

3075
01:44:48,540 --> 01:44:48,780
Day!

3076
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:53,140
I have never, ever, ever heard idols ever cover this song before!

3077
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:55,440
And I go to my...

3078
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,620
I look at my friend and I scream at her.

3079
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,460
And she was like...

3080
01:44:59,460 --> 01:45:00,280
She was like, what?

3081
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:03,020
And I was like, I sang this song last night!

3082
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,180
I was like...

3083
01:45:07,660 --> 01:45:11,010
In a concert yesterday!

3084
01:45:14,390 --> 01:45:16,030
I was like, no way.

3085
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:17,610
No way!

3086
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:20,550
And so I was doing the dance with it.

3087
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:22,390
Hold on.

3088
01:45:22,510 --> 01:45:23,670
I want to show you my favorite part.

3089
01:45:23,950 --> 01:45:25,370
I love the dance here.

3090
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:35,470
I love

3091
01:45:44,910 --> 01:46:02,390
the dance with this though.

3092
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:03,210
It's so cute!

3093
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,210
So you guys should learn it too.

3094
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:10,350
And then you wave your hands around.

3095
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:17,830
And everybody sing the waya waya waya with me next time, okay?

3096
01:46:37,770 --> 01:46:39,690
I love the close-up they did there.

3097
01:46:39,870 --> 01:46:40,370
It's so awesome.

3098
01:46:40,370 --> 01:46:43,630
I love the visuals here, right?

3099
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:46,850
Like having the two screens on the side and then in the middle.

3100
01:46:47,630 --> 01:46:48,070
It was...

3101
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:49,490
It looks so natural.

3102
01:46:49,750 --> 01:46:50,310
It's like...

3103
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:53,210
Probably one of the best setups I've seen for a...

3104
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:55,270
For a VTuber concert like ever.

3105
01:46:55,550 --> 01:46:57,130
So, so good!

3106
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:59,810
It's so good!

3107
01:47:38,720 --> 01:47:39,860
It's so, so good!

3108
01:47:39,860 --> 01:47:40,400
I'll finish it.

3109
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:41,920
Five!

3110
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:44,900
I jumped early.

3111
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:49,600
Oopsie.

3112
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:52,220
Yeah.

3113
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:55,480
Everybody was so energetic and it was so much fun.

3114
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:01,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3115
01:48:04,530 --> 01:48:06,110
It was a lot of fun.

3116
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:09,930
Crowd was amazing.

3117
01:48:09,930 --> 01:48:10,230
Yeah.

3118
01:48:15,730 --> 01:48:19,950
So, thank you, Maria, for working so hard on that.

3119
01:48:20,110 --> 01:48:20,770
And Daryl, too.

3120
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:23,290
Everybody invited me and...

3121
01:48:23,290 --> 01:48:25,850
Your voice is so golden.

3122
01:48:26,030 --> 01:48:26,890
I was really nervous.

3123
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:32,010
You could hear, I think, most of my nervous through in...

3124
01:48:32,530 --> 01:48:33,190
What's it called?

3125
01:48:34,410 --> 01:48:35,810
Realize, the second song I did.

3126
01:48:35,970 --> 01:48:36,890
I don't know, I was just...

3127
01:48:37,850 --> 01:48:40,890
I was really nervous that I wouldn't be able to sing it well.

3128
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:44,270
But my voice has been improving so much.

3129
01:48:45,770 --> 01:48:47,270
Well, I'm not improving.

3130
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:48,070
Healing.

3131
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:49,250
So much.

3132
01:48:49,530 --> 01:48:50,010
So...

3133
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:50,910
Thank you, guys.

3134
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:53,890
For letting me take the time to...

3135
01:48:54,410 --> 01:48:56,890
I still plan on doing less streams...

3136
01:48:58,450 --> 01:48:59,730
Until September.

3137
01:49:00,450 --> 01:49:01,550
I think by then.

3138
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:03,650
I should be good.

3139
01:49:03,650 --> 01:49:04,850
Um...

3140
01:49:04,850 --> 01:49:06,610
They say a couple months to...

3141
01:49:08,030 --> 01:49:08,650
To...

3142
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:10,170
Heal it, usually.

3143
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:11,330
So...

3144
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:12,970
Hmm...

3145
01:49:12,970 --> 01:49:13,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3146
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:18,070
Singing and dancing were both mind-blowingly amazing.

3147
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:27,020
So, I know that I'm trying to also...

3148
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,320
Rest until...

3149
01:49:31,180 --> 01:49:31,580
Um...

3150
01:49:31,580 --> 01:49:32,820
Obviously, it comes...

3151
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:33,000
I...

3152
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:34,080
Like, I feel good now.

3153
01:49:35,120 --> 01:49:35,520
Um...

3154
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,820
But I still wanna give it that extra time until September.

3155
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:40,080
So, yeah.

3156
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:41,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3157
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:44,700
Uh...

3158
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:44,840
Uh...

3159
01:49:44,840 --> 01:49:46,140
And also because...

3160
01:49:46,140 --> 01:49:48,260
Oh, and then, of course, you know, um...

3161
01:49:48,840 --> 01:49:49,700
Virtual Vacation.

3162
01:49:50,500 --> 01:49:51,020
Doobie...

3163
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:54,360
Doobie invited Doki and I to help sing...

3164
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,180
Backup vocals for...

3165
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:57,720
For Otana Blues.

3166
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:00,740
And I really like that song, so I was very excited.

3167
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:03,740
Glad you're being cautious.

3168
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:04,460
Yeah!

3169
01:50:04,940 --> 01:50:05,780
Like I said, like...

3170
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:06,140
My...

3171
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:08,140
My throw feels so much better now.

3172
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:10,060
But I just wanna give it the extra...

3173
01:50:10,060 --> 01:50:10,960
Extra...

3174
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,040
Extra little bit of time.

3175
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:13,640
Yeah.

3176
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:19,180
Don't wanna undo all your healing by overdoing it.

3177
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:19,520
Yeah!

3178
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:20,660
Pretty much.

3179
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,060
Pretty much.

3180
01:50:22,180 --> 01:50:22,720
Pretty much.

3181
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:25,360
But I...

3182
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:26,400
Will now be...

3183
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,460
Back to streaming.

3184
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,760
This week, I wanna do a little bit extra stream since it's been a minute.

3185
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:32,040
But...

3186
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:32,760
Next week...

3187
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:34,600
Um...

3188
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:35,820
Next week, I will...

3189
01:50:36,900 --> 01:50:37,180
Oh!

3190
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:37,780
And Doki!

3191
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:38,180
Yes!

3192
01:50:38,460 --> 01:50:38,620
Yo!

3193
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,120
Oh my gosh!

3194
01:50:39,240 --> 01:50:40,280
Doki's birthday concert!

3195
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,440
Oh my gosh, I'm so stupid.

3196
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:43,040
Yeah!

3197
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:44,280
I was so...

3198
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,460
There was so much happening.

3199
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:49,960
There was so much happening!

3200
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,020
Oh my gosh!

3201
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,160
Sloppy sisters!

3202
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:57,640
Sloppy idol unit.

3203
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,620
There were so many things!

3204
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:00,980
Yeah, we did sing Sonic.

3205
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:02,400
It was funny.

3206
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:03,720
We talked about it in the MC.

3207
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:05,000
But how...

3208
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:05,620
Um...

3209
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:07,680
We were like going through so many different songs.

3210
01:51:08,260 --> 01:51:08,540
Like...

3211
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,640
My Little Pony.

3212
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:11,100
Um...

3213
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,200
Oh gosh, what else was there?

3214
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:17,300
We had a gaggle of wisps doing the realized video copy.

3215
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:20,760
But it's really hard to recreate that idoloda video because you're just too popular.

3216
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:22,400
What do you mean?

3217
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:24,280
What do you mean?

3218
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:35,690
I know she is well-traveled.

3219
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:39,470
You're too popular.

3220
01:51:39,650 --> 01:51:40,070
No, I...

3221
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,710
What do you mean?

3222
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:42,930
What do you mean?

3223
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:46,510
The concert performance is so good.

3224
01:51:46,690 --> 01:51:47,170
Thank you!

3225
01:51:47,830 --> 01:51:48,850
Thank you, thank you!

3226
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:52,330
There's too many of us.

3227
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:03,700
Never get one-on-one unless you do it at meet-and-greet.

3228
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:05,220
Wait, that's a good idea!

3229
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:07,320
Do it at a meet-and-greet!

3230
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:09,820
Spit-and-greet!

3231
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,480
I spit on you while you dance!

3232
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,160
I spit.

3233
01:52:16,420 --> 01:52:17,080
You dance!

3234
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:19,480
Dance for me!

3235
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:23,640
Dance for me!

3236
01:52:23,820 --> 01:52:24,100
Patooi!

3237
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:24,660
Patooi!

3238
01:52:25,920 --> 01:52:27,380
Virtual vacation last year.

3239
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,820
Fantastic reality this year.

3240
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:32,340
Plus all the Minto prints I got at AX so much Minto in LA!

3241
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:35,780
I'm like a LA girl.

3242
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:37,540
I'm like a valley girl.

3243
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:41,280
No, unofficial mint of Kai was best mint of...

3244
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:41,600
No!

3245
01:52:43,340 --> 01:52:45,340
I wasn't even a guest at...

3246
01:52:45,340 --> 01:52:45,880
Of Kai.

3247
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,640
Do a meet and greet with your 3D one day then.

3248
01:52:49,820 --> 01:52:50,220
I will.

3249
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,060
I will, I will, I will.

3250
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:58,920
Oh!

3251
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:00,580
Kiwawa's vacuum.

3252
01:53:00,780 --> 01:53:02,320
Oh my gosh, I didn't even reckon...

3253
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:03,460
Or, no, not reckon.

3254
01:53:03,620 --> 01:53:05,580
I didn't even talk about that.

3255
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:06,700
I...

3256
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:09,040
That was actually a surprise.

3257
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:12,820
Like, she did not tell me beforehand.

3258
01:53:13,480 --> 01:53:16,700
And in fact, when she was practicing that bit, she...

3259
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:18,960
Kicked me out of the room during rehearsal.

3260
01:53:21,060 --> 01:53:23,620
And then when we actually did it.

3261
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:27,340
Then when we actually did it is when she pulled it out.

3262
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:29,480
So it was unscripted.

3263
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:30,660
100%.

3264
01:53:31,680 --> 01:53:32,260
100%.

3265
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:38,200
Afterwards, with the staff, she came out.

3266
01:53:38,280 --> 01:53:39,980
She was like, Dockiri, daiseiko!

3267
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,640
Which was like...

3268
01:53:42,640 --> 01:53:43,980
Which is like...

3269
01:53:43,980 --> 01:53:46,300
The prank was a success!

3270
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,180
The surprise was a success!

3271
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,420
Yeah, she actually surprised me with that.

3272
01:53:51,420 --> 01:53:51,860
But...

3273
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:54,280
I didn't even expect to see you this much this week.

3274
01:53:54,380 --> 01:53:55,720
But saw you in person at all three!

3275
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:57,600
I'm eternally blessed to be a wisp.

3276
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:58,820
Thank you for haunting Mickey!

3277
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:01,200
Thank you!

3278
01:54:02,080 --> 01:54:03,020
I'm glad I...

3279
01:54:03,020 --> 01:54:06,140
I gotta keep you guys on your toes a little bit, huh?

3280
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:12,910
Unofficial guest, but still so much Minto.

3281
01:54:13,110 --> 01:54:14,070
I'm big Minto!

3282
01:54:14,330 --> 01:54:14,670
Y'all!

3283
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:16,590
I...

3284
01:54:16,590 --> 01:54:18,950
I wouldn't even say unofficial guest.

3285
01:54:19,090 --> 01:54:20,270
I wasn't a guest at all.

3286
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:22,450
I was just...

3287
01:54:23,470 --> 01:54:25,110
I was just...

3288
01:54:25,110 --> 01:54:25,750
Yeah.

3289
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,090
I was just...

3290
01:54:30,090 --> 01:54:30,910
I was just there.

3291
01:54:34,270 --> 01:54:35,530
You haunted.

3292
01:54:35,770 --> 01:54:36,670
I did haunt!

3293
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:38,810
I did haunt.

3294
01:54:40,370 --> 01:54:42,430
Hopefully next year, they...

3295
01:54:42,430 --> 01:54:44,630
I know that they don't do the...

3296
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:45,270
Guest...

3297
01:54:46,590 --> 01:54:47,430
Um...

3298
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:48,210
Uh...

3299
01:54:48,210 --> 01:54:49,310
In a row...

3300
01:54:50,270 --> 01:54:51,090
I would like...

3301
01:54:51,090 --> 01:54:53,710
I hope that maybe next year I can be a guest, though.

3302
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:54,810
Actually.

3303
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:57,570
Because I feel like...

3304
01:54:57,570 --> 01:54:58,370
Um...

3305
01:54:58,370 --> 01:54:59,410
Last year...

3306
01:55:00,090 --> 01:55:02,170
I was a guest only because of Matara.

3307
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:03,950
We had our podcast.

3308
01:55:04,510 --> 01:55:04,910
And...

3309
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:07,830
She's the one who was just like, Hey, you should get Minto as a guest, too.

3310
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:09,770
So...

3311
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:10,450
Uh...

3312
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:11,010
I...

3313
01:55:11,010 --> 01:55:13,170
Almost felt like I wasn't a guest.

3314
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:16,490
Um...

3315
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:17,870
So I hope...

3316
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:19,930
Next year, I can be a guest guest.

3317
01:55:20,310 --> 01:55:21,150
No, I'm a BGM.

3318
01:55:21,330 --> 01:55:21,410
Oh!

3319
01:55:21,730 --> 01:55:22,170
Sorry!

3320
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:23,810
Cosmo...

3321
01:55:23,810 --> 01:55:23,950
Oh!

3322
01:55:24,270 --> 01:55:24,810
Thank you!

3323
01:55:27,690 --> 01:55:28,410
Thank you!

3324
01:55:28,570 --> 01:55:28,890
Thank you!

3325
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:30,370
Thank you!

3326
01:55:33,290 --> 01:55:33,850
Yeah...

3327
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:35,870
I've had it playing this entire time, too.

3328
01:55:36,110 --> 01:55:36,590
Whoopsie!

3329
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:38,510
Whoopsie boopsie!

3330
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:40,650
Um...

3331
01:55:40,650 --> 01:55:41,130
But...

3332
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:43,270
Yeah...

3333
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:43,830
So...

3334
01:55:43,830 --> 01:55:45,270
Hopefully I can be a guest next year.

3335
01:55:45,430 --> 01:55:46,030
That'd be fun.

3336
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,530
It was quite silent.

3337
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,910
It's an actual podcast, if there's no music.

3338
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:53,990
Takeover 2026.

3339
01:55:57,090 --> 01:55:57,870
I don't know.

3340
01:55:58,090 --> 01:56:00,090
If I'm a guest next year, what should we do?

3341
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:02,950
I want to do something fun.

3342
01:56:03,110 --> 01:56:03,610
Something special.

3343
01:56:05,530 --> 01:56:06,230
I'll brainstorm.

3344
01:56:07,050 --> 01:56:09,090
What if I could do a haunted house?

3345
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:13,290
What if I could do like a...

3346
01:56:13,290 --> 01:56:14,610
Haunted house?

3347
01:56:16,030 --> 01:56:16,570
Style.

3348
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:24,900
I will pitch it.

3349
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:31,300
Rent out the Winchester?

3350
01:56:32,460 --> 01:56:34,260
That would be so awesome.

3351
01:56:35,360 --> 01:56:36,800
Saturday night concert performer?

3352
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:39,560
I want to... I hope I get invited.

3353
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:41,460
I want to be in the concert so bad.

3354
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:45,960
I want to be... I want to sing in the concert.

3355
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:57,990
I want to... I want to... I want to... I will be screaming at the front.

3356
01:56:58,650 --> 01:56:59,090
August!

3357
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:04,910
Thank you for beating me, yeah, Ofkai.

3358
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:10,490
But yeah, I also was able to do the call and mix panel, yeah.

3359
01:57:10,770 --> 01:57:11,570
With Ashes.

3360
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:13,890
I was... I was invited for that.

3361
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:16,410
So actually, I was in three panels, Ofkai.

3362
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:18,850
My brain... I can't remember everything.

3363
01:57:19,270 --> 01:57:20,370
There's been so much happening.

3364
01:57:20,870 --> 01:57:22,890
I can't remember everything that's going on.

3365
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:25,870
Thank you, thank you.

3366
01:57:26,230 --> 01:57:26,550
Choo.

3367
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,570
Choo.

3368
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:29,510
Hope you can get plenty of rest.

3369
01:57:29,630 --> 01:57:32,110
I'm glad I was able to see your performance at Fantastic Reality.

3370
01:57:32,510 --> 01:57:34,230
And the other venues during AX.

3371
01:57:34,490 --> 01:57:38,630
You might not have been directly there, but it was definitely felt like you had a spiritual presence haunting the area.

3372
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:39,310
Yeah.

3373
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:41,130
I do love haunting.

3374
01:57:41,710 --> 01:57:43,950
I do love doing the haunting thing.

3375
01:57:45,170 --> 01:57:48,630
Haunted house style school festival maid cafe sounds so fun.

3376
01:57:49,330 --> 01:57:50,710
That would be fun.

3377
01:57:51,710 --> 01:57:53,370
I'm gonna pitch it.

3378
01:57:53,490 --> 01:57:55,610
I'm gonna pitch a haunted house.

3379
01:57:56,770 --> 01:57:58,050
So happy you were there, though.

3380
01:57:58,490 --> 01:57:59,210
Where are we?

3381
01:58:03,370 --> 01:58:04,350
I'm happy, too.

3382
01:58:04,850 --> 01:58:05,570
It was fun.

3383
01:58:05,810 --> 01:58:06,430
It was a lot of fun.

3384
01:58:11,570 --> 01:58:12,090
So.

3385
01:58:13,930 --> 01:58:16,750
You guys, I watched some new movies on the plane home.

3386
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:19,690
I watched three new movies.

3387
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:21,510
I only liked one of them.

3388
01:58:23,070 --> 01:58:23,970
I watched...

3389
01:58:27,290 --> 01:58:29,370
I watched Mickey 17.

3390
01:58:30,310 --> 01:58:31,710
I liked that one.

3391
01:58:32,350 --> 01:58:34,310
I liked Mickey 17.

3392
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:35,410
That one was pretty good.

3393
01:58:35,730 --> 01:58:37,070
I like Robert Pattinson.

3394
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:39,910
I've come to really appreciate that guy.

3395
01:58:40,610 --> 01:58:42,230
I think he's a good actor.

3396
01:58:42,670 --> 01:58:43,510
Mickey 17.

3397
01:58:44,890 --> 01:58:45,990
It's pretty silly.

3398
01:58:46,130 --> 01:58:46,730
It is silly.

3399
01:58:46,730 --> 01:58:49,350
It's much sillier than I expected it to be.

3400
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:51,770
And also...

3401
01:58:51,770 --> 01:58:52,630
I was like, whoa.

3402
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:53,970
This is getting a little sexy.

3403
01:58:56,610 --> 01:58:57,090
Um...

3404
01:58:57,090 --> 01:58:59,670
I watched The Woman in the Yard.

3405
01:59:00,330 --> 01:59:01,970
I did not like that one.

3406
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:05,010
I didn't like it very much.

3407
01:59:06,050 --> 01:59:07,390
Which I thought I would.

3408
01:59:07,870 --> 01:59:09,850
I'm not, like, someone who...

3409
01:59:11,850 --> 01:59:12,410
Who...

3410
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:15,130
dislikes a slow horror movie.

3411
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:16,690
You're a soon...

3412
01:59:16,690 --> 01:59:18,330
But I just didn't like it.

3413
01:59:19,110 --> 01:59:19,590
Evil!

3414
01:59:22,270 --> 01:59:23,390
Thank you.

3415
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:28,050
Sorry I didn't make it off-kite this year to see you.

3416
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:30,330
But I hope to see you at a guest at another con in the area.

3417
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:31,330
Soon.

3418
01:59:32,010 --> 01:59:33,470
Always love everything you do, Minto.

3419
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,170
Thank you!

3420
01:59:34,830 --> 01:59:38,890
I hope I can get to more cons and stuff too, yeah.

3421
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:42,410
Still doing the John Wick series watch-along?

3422
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:43,210
I want to.

3423
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:44,130
But before that...

3424
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:47,030
I...

3425
01:59:48,190 --> 01:59:48,630
Um...

3426
01:59:48,630 --> 01:59:49,770
Why'd my tongue come out?

3427
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:56,510
Why'd my tongue come out?

3428
02:00:14,530 --> 02:00:17,770
Before we watch the John...

3429
02:00:17,770 --> 02:00:19,250
John Wick...

3430
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:21,230
I want to...

3431
02:00:21,230 --> 02:00:21,630
Okay.

3432
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:22,830
So I was...

3433
02:00:22,830 --> 02:00:24,930
This is not a movie I watched on the plane.

3434
02:00:24,930 --> 02:00:26,370
But I want to watch.

3435
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,470
Because...

3436
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:30,330
Because...

3437
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:31,050
Um...

3438
02:00:31,050 --> 02:00:33,430
There was a person in front of me watching it.

3439
02:00:33,490 --> 02:00:34,210
And I was like, oh my gosh.

3440
02:00:34,350 --> 02:00:35,510
Now I would watch it.

3441
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:36,390
And fall asleep.

3442
02:00:36,530 --> 02:00:37,230
And wake up.

3443
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:38,910
And watch it from her screen.

3444
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:39,890
And fall asleep.

3445
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:40,790
And wake up.

3446
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:42,010
And watch it from her screen.

3447
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:42,750
And fall asleep.

3448
02:00:42,910 --> 02:00:44,710
And it was Legally Blonde!

3449
02:00:47,190 --> 02:00:48,150
John Wick.

3450
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:56,430
Did I get it wrong?

3451
02:01:04,300 --> 02:01:07,880
I feel like there might be people that I've never seen Legally Blonde before.

3452
02:01:08,080 --> 02:01:09,500
And it's actually such a good movie.

3453
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:10,820
I want everybody to watch it.

3454
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:15,900
Alan Wick.

3455
02:01:17,060 --> 02:01:17,540
Wick!

3456
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:18,420
Ah!

3457
02:01:19,140 --> 02:01:19,720
Oh my gosh.

3458
02:01:19,720 --> 02:01:21,320
I get it wrong every time!

3459
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:23,720
John Wick.

3460
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:26,100
Alan Wake.

3461
02:01:26,640 --> 02:01:30,020
Before we do the John Wick...

3462
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:37,640
The John Wick movie marathon, I want to watch Legally Blonde.

3463
02:01:38,160 --> 02:01:40,220
I want to watch Legally Blonde!

3464
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:49,390
John Wick like a candle.

3465
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:50,890
Alan Wake up.

3466
02:01:51,130 --> 02:01:51,610
Girls.

3467
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:57,790
I've been watching your spooky game vibes and wondered if you've ever played The Letter or Saint Maker.

3468
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:59,510
They're visual novel spooky games.

3469
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:00,210
I have not.

3470
02:02:00,210 --> 02:02:01,370
I don't think so.

3471
02:02:04,290 --> 02:02:08,930
Amen on Legally Blonde is my mom's favorite movie alongside Blade Runner.

3472
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:10,290
Your mom has such good taste!

3473
02:02:12,710 --> 02:02:13,890
Wait, John Wick.

3474
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:14,490
No, no, no!

3475
02:02:14,650 --> 02:02:15,290
John Wick!

3476
02:02:16,230 --> 02:02:17,170
John Wick.

3477
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:18,850
John Wick.

3478
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:24,030
But yeah, I want to watch Legally Blonde in case other people have not seen Legally Blonde before.

3479
02:02:24,090 --> 02:02:25,650
Because it's actually such a good movie.

3480
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:30,870
It's actually a really good movie if you've never seen it.

3481
02:02:30,870 --> 02:02:37,730
Raise your hand if you've never seen Legally Blonde.

3482
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,100
The movie or musical?

3483
02:02:42,320 --> 02:02:43,340
Probably the movie.

3484
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:49,670
I haven't.

3485
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:52,970
I recommend it so much.

3486
02:02:55,390 --> 02:02:57,790
It's actually such a good movie.

3487
02:02:58,030 --> 02:03:00,510
I know I've said that like 15 times, but...

3488
02:03:00,510 --> 02:03:03,150
It's like so witty.

3489
02:03:03,150 --> 02:03:05,930
And it's still so funny.

3490
02:03:10,270 --> 02:03:12,410
And has one of the greatest...

3491
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:15,190
It has like an Ace Attorney level...

3492
02:03:15,190 --> 02:03:18,110
Like, court scene that is just so...

3493
02:03:18,110 --> 02:03:19,150
So good.

3494
02:03:19,470 --> 02:03:20,630
It makes you be like...

3495
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:21,170
Oh!

3496
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:21,790
Oh!

3497
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:22,850
Like that!

3498
02:03:23,090 --> 02:03:23,530
You go...

3499
02:03:23,530 --> 02:03:23,670
Oh!

3500
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:24,090
Oh!

3501
02:03:24,250 --> 02:03:24,530
Oh!

3502
02:03:24,710 --> 02:03:25,390
You do that!

3503
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:26,430
You do that!

3504
02:03:28,970 --> 02:03:29,890
Yes, it does.

3505
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:30,790
I know!

3506
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:32,690
Will you teach us the bend and snap?

3507
02:03:32,690 --> 02:03:33,870
And the next time you're in 3D?

3508
02:03:34,110 --> 02:03:35,270
Yeah, I will.

3509
02:03:36,650 --> 02:03:37,610
The bend...

3510
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,370
And snap!

3511
02:03:40,870 --> 02:03:41,670
Just like that.

3512
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:49,370
So we'll watch that.

3513
02:03:49,570 --> 02:03:50,250
Probably this week.

3514
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:51,810
Because I want to watch it.

3515
02:03:55,150 --> 02:03:56,490
Because I want to watch it.

3516
02:03:56,890 --> 02:03:58,090
Watch it later this week.

3517
02:04:02,080 --> 02:04:02,760
What else?

3518
02:04:03,480 --> 02:04:04,180
Oh!

3519
02:04:04,340 --> 02:04:05,420
I watched, uh...

3520
02:04:05,420 --> 02:04:05,960
The...

3521
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:07,520
America's Luckiest Man.

3522
02:04:11,300 --> 02:04:12,000
Uh...

3523
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,060
1990 Ninja Turtles film.

3524
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:14,760
Maybe?

3525
02:04:14,920 --> 02:04:15,500
I don't remember.

3526
02:04:15,660 --> 02:04:16,800
Is that the one with the...

3527
02:04:16,800 --> 02:04:18,960
Costumes that are now decaying...

3528
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:19,700
And scary looking?

3529
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:22,220
Where does Neil Breen go though?

3530
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:25,640
Neil Breen goes first.

3531
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:31,860
Have you seen K-pop Demon Hunters?

3532
02:04:31,980 --> 02:04:32,440
Not yet.

3533
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:34,520
But I've seen it everywhere.

3534
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,780
I've seen everybody talking about it.

3535
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:38,720
The Jim Henson costumes.

3536
02:04:38,900 --> 02:04:40,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3537
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3538
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:48,970
But I watched the...

3539
02:04:48,970 --> 02:04:50,150
America's Luckiest Man.

3540
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:52,450
Which is about some guy...

3541
02:04:52,450 --> 02:04:56,490
It's like based on a true story about a guy who went on a game show in the 80s.

3542
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:58,970
And like he memorized the game show.

3543
02:04:59,490 --> 02:05:01,390
And then won a bunch of money.

3544
02:05:02,130 --> 02:05:04,030
And the movie was just...

3545
02:05:06,370 --> 02:05:08,430
The movie was just really boring.

3546
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:14,310
I was like, oh, this is such a...

3547
02:05:15,790 --> 02:05:17,650
This is such an interesting premise.

3548
02:05:18,170 --> 02:05:20,110
It was so boring.

3549
02:05:31,810 --> 02:05:33,150
So, um...

3550
02:05:33,150 --> 02:05:34,410
I don't recommend that one.

3551
02:05:36,070 --> 02:05:37,690
I don't recommend it.

3552
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:41,230
The game show was called Press Your Luck.

3553
02:05:41,390 --> 02:05:42,110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3554
02:05:43,050 --> 02:05:45,090
Highly recommend watching Alien Stage.

3555
02:05:45,350 --> 02:05:47,130
Oh, I know Alien Stage.

3556
02:05:49,210 --> 02:05:50,410
Barry Berg.

3557
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:52,630
I love Minto, happy one year.

3558
02:05:52,630 --> 02:05:53,830
Barry Bug.

3559
02:05:54,570 --> 02:05:56,310
I was literally talking about you earlier.

3560
02:05:57,210 --> 02:05:57,730
Barry Bug.

3561
02:06:00,170 --> 02:06:00,770
Barry.

3562
02:06:08,050 --> 02:06:09,150
Minty Fatou.

3563
02:06:16,170 --> 02:06:19,010
Just got home from AX within the bus hour.

3564
02:06:19,230 --> 02:06:21,330
When you perform God knows during Fantastic Reality.

3565
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:22,010
I shout out now.

3566
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:23,710
That's the Mint Phantom I know.

3567
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:28,930
I was not expecting Phantom Thief to show up during virtual vacation either.

3568
02:06:29,350 --> 02:06:29,630
Yeah.

3569
02:06:32,110 --> 02:06:32,790
Surprising.

3570
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:37,010
You think there is a gay or European video edit with Ocelot?

3571
02:06:37,170 --> 02:06:38,030
I hope so.

3572
02:06:39,230 --> 02:06:40,550
Gay or European?

3573
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:43,590
It's hard to guarantee.

3574
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:45,510
Is he gay or European?

3575
02:06:46,150 --> 02:06:46,950
Oh, hey.

3576
02:06:47,070 --> 02:06:47,790
Don't look at me.

3577
02:06:54,020 --> 02:06:56,480
This man is gay and European.

3578
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:05,790
There's a Takamori edit of it.

3579
02:07:07,350 --> 02:07:07,830
Kiwawa.

3580
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:10,330
Kiwawa.

3581
02:07:16,530 --> 02:07:17,510
It's a good song.

3582
02:07:17,770 --> 02:07:18,150
I don't know.

3583
02:07:18,330 --> 02:07:19,850
I kind of want to watch the movie first.

3584
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:21,490
Just in case people haven't seen the movie.

3585
02:07:21,490 --> 02:07:23,270
Then he watched the musical.

3586
02:07:23,550 --> 02:07:23,930
Hat dog.

3587
02:07:24,270 --> 02:07:24,930
Hat dog.

3588
02:07:25,470 --> 02:07:25,790
Wow.

3589
02:07:25,870 --> 02:07:26,250
Promotion.

3590
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:28,050
I'm going to ban every other room.

3591
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:31,310
She has the power.

3592
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:31,690
Do it.

3593
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:33,310
Ban someone right now.

3594
02:07:34,310 --> 02:07:35,470
You have the power.

3595
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:37,670
You have the power.

3596
02:07:38,290 --> 02:07:40,770
Afkai was overwhelming but so much fun.

3597
02:07:41,070 --> 02:07:44,030
Walked into it expecting not much mint stuff other than merch.

3598
02:07:44,030 --> 02:07:45,950
So I was really happy to see you at so many panels.

3599
02:07:46,190 --> 02:07:48,110
It's a long trip for me but well worth it.

3600
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:50,010
We'll go next year if I can.

3601
02:07:50,270 --> 02:07:51,610
Happy to see my Oshii thriving.

3602
02:07:51,890 --> 02:07:52,950
Thank you, Chase.

3603
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:04,160
Barry, tell Mint about what you noticed in the Winchester house.

3604
02:08:04,200 --> 02:08:04,820
Oh my gosh, Barry.

3605
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,580
I was telling everybody about how awesome.

3606
02:08:08,940 --> 02:08:10,100
Sarah, our homie.

3607
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:14,900
Sarah Winchester is our homie, everybody.

3608
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:18,500
She's so cool.

3609
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:20,480
It was built for you.

3610
02:08:47,670 --> 02:08:49,610
Having attended Fantastic Reality.

3611
02:08:49,950 --> 02:08:50,990
Fantastic show, by the way.

3612
02:08:51,190 --> 02:08:55,530
Can absolutely say, you are ready to headline your own concert.

3613
02:08:56,050 --> 02:08:57,610
I don't know about that.

3614
02:08:59,450 --> 02:09:00,810
I don't know about that.

3615
02:09:01,290 --> 02:09:04,970
Barry said you got singled out by the tour guide for not needing to crouch to go through tours.

3616
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:13,210
There was a...

3617
02:09:13,210 --> 02:09:14,050
There was like a...

3618
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:16,610
The tour guide was talking about...

3619
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:17,850
Okay, first of all.

3620
02:09:17,990 --> 02:09:18,610
First of all.

3621
02:09:18,690 --> 02:09:19,330
First of all.

3622
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:22,930
I wore big platform shoes, okay?

3623
02:09:23,370 --> 02:09:25,190
I wore platform shoes.

3624
02:09:26,690 --> 02:09:27,170
So...

3625
02:09:27,170 --> 02:09:28,930
Um, I did need to duck.

3626
02:09:29,190 --> 02:09:30,910
Because I wore my big shoes.

3627
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:33,070
And there was like a...

3628
02:09:33,070 --> 02:09:34,250
The tour guide was like...

3629
02:09:34,250 --> 02:09:34,710
This is...

3630
02:09:34,710 --> 02:09:36,430
This is how tall...

3631
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:37,590
Um...

3632
02:09:37,590 --> 02:09:38,810
Sarah Winchester was.

3633
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:40,630
And the house was built for her height.

3634
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:43,210
And...

3635
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:45,030
And they were like...

3636
02:09:45,030 --> 02:09:46,530
Go stand next to it, Mint.

3637
02:09:46,850 --> 02:09:47,850
And I was like...

3638
02:09:47,850 --> 02:09:48,070
Okay.

3639
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,730
And I stand next to it.

3640
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:51,450
And then...

3641
02:09:51,450 --> 02:09:52,610
I took off my shoe.

3642
02:09:52,910 --> 02:09:54,150
And went...

3643
02:09:54,150 --> 02:09:54,610
Flomp.

3644
02:09:57,950 --> 02:09:59,810
I still think I was taller than her though.

3645
02:10:02,110 --> 02:10:05,320
While you were away, I managed to land a job!

3646
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:07,500
Yesterday was my first day.

3647
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:08,340
And you coming back today...

3648
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,620
Feels like a perfect little celebration.

3649
02:10:09,860 --> 02:10:10,060
Go!

3650
02:10:10,300 --> 02:10:10,420
Go!

3651
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:12,000
Congratulations!

3652
02:10:15,640 --> 02:10:16,980
I don't know.

3653
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,300
Barry will probably say that I was taller.

3654
02:10:21,240 --> 02:10:23,440
Mint, can you visit Kawaii Con someday?

3655
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:25,380
We got beautiful beaches...

3656
02:10:25,380 --> 02:10:27,600
And super cute cosplayers in Hawaii.

3657
02:10:28,620 --> 02:10:31,080
It's so hard flying out from this tiny rock to off-cut.

3658
02:10:31,320 --> 02:10:32,220
I want to!

3659
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:33,620
I want to though.

3660
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:34,580
I want to, Cosmo.

3661
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:35,160
For real.

3662
02:10:36,640 --> 02:10:39,180
Actually, I was talking about Kawaii Con recently.

3663
02:10:42,520 --> 02:10:43,180
It's okay.

3664
02:10:43,300 --> 02:10:44,420
We both wore platform shoes.

3665
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:45,780
I should have just worn my cross.

3666
02:11:03,510 --> 02:11:05,270
I also got called out though.

3667
02:11:06,310 --> 02:11:06,810
Because...

3668
02:11:06,810 --> 02:11:09,390
The tour guide was talking about like...

3669
02:11:09,390 --> 02:11:12,810
The shower that was specifically built for Sarah Winchester.

3670
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:17,330
And how it was made so that it would only shower her from the neck down.

3671
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:20,270
So that her hair wouldn't get wet.

3672
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:21,350
Because back then...

3673
02:11:21,350 --> 02:11:23,830
They had like special days for washing their hair.

3674
02:11:24,130 --> 02:11:26,450
So that then they would style it and all this stuff.

3675
02:11:26,450 --> 02:11:27,930
And it took a long time to style.

3676
02:11:29,310 --> 02:11:31,230
And the tour guide was just like...

3677
02:11:31,230 --> 02:11:31,510
So yeah.

3678
02:11:31,750 --> 02:11:33,430
Every adult in this room...

3679
02:11:34,690 --> 02:11:36,650
Would not be showered properly.

3680
02:11:37,210 --> 02:11:38,390
Because it wouldn't...

3681
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:39,310
You know, get your...

3682
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:40,290
It wouldn't reach your neck.

3683
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:42,390
And then she looks at me and goes...

3684
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:43,090
Except you.

3685
02:11:43,350 --> 02:11:44,710
I think you'd be okay.

3686
02:11:56,640 --> 02:11:57,740
I was like...

3687
02:12:01,850 --> 02:12:03,590
Why did you call me help?

3688
02:12:11,970 --> 02:12:15,090
You see, she made the house so that you would welcome a...

3689
02:12:15,090 --> 02:12:16,430
Would be a welcome ghost.

3690
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:18,910
Other ghosts can go smack their heads and leave.

3691
02:12:20,210 --> 02:12:21,770
Plus two, tour guide!

3692
02:12:22,890 --> 02:12:24,250
She did you so dirty.

3693
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:24,870
She did!

3694
02:12:25,870 --> 02:12:26,690
She did!

3695
02:12:30,350 --> 02:12:31,450
I didn't...

3696
02:12:31,450 --> 02:12:33,070
I was so kind to her.

3697
02:12:34,630 --> 02:12:35,590
I was...

3698
02:12:35,590 --> 02:12:36,890
We were so...

3699
02:12:36,890 --> 02:12:38,810
Respectful to the tour guide.

3700
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:40,790
I was even just like...

3701
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:41,870
I like her.

3702
02:12:42,190 --> 02:12:43,030
She's cool.

3703
02:12:44,350 --> 02:12:46,790
Sarah Winchester's niece was also a weeb.

3704
02:12:46,850 --> 02:12:47,150
Yeah!

3705
02:12:47,290 --> 02:12:48,610
She had like a whole room.

3706
02:12:48,910 --> 02:12:51,410
A whole like Japanese style room.

3707
02:12:51,690 --> 02:12:52,810
The original weeaboo.

3708
02:12:53,030 --> 02:12:53,590
Besides...

3709
02:12:53,590 --> 02:12:54,230
Actually, hold on.

3710
02:12:55,150 --> 02:12:56,110
When was...

3711
02:12:56,110 --> 02:12:56,410
Let's see.

3712
02:12:57,670 --> 02:12:59,330
Vincent Van Gogh.

3713
02:13:03,620 --> 02:13:05,820
He existed at the same time.

3714
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,440
Sarah Winchester's...

3715
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:09,760
Sister.

3716
02:13:10,160 --> 02:13:10,660
Oh my gosh.

3717
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:12,360
Which one was the original weeab?

3718
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:15,020
Who knows?

3719
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:16,240
Oh my gosh.

3720
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:18,620
He should have married Sarah's sister.

3721
02:13:18,780 --> 02:13:20,120
They would have been weeabs together.

3722
02:13:24,370 --> 02:13:25,110
Welcome home.

3723
02:13:25,310 --> 02:13:27,010
We don't mind if I get a belated happy birthday from you.

3724
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:28,610
Just jazzed them.

3725
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:29,690
Happy birthday!

3726
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:31,030
Sorry.

3727
02:13:31,210 --> 02:13:31,950
I'm a little late.

3728
02:13:32,210 --> 02:13:32,590
Sorry.

3729
02:13:33,410 --> 02:13:34,370
But happy birthday.

3730
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:37,350
Look at me too.

3731
02:13:37,490 --> 02:13:37,890
We missed you.

3732
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:38,790
I missed you guys.

3733
02:13:38,930 --> 02:13:40,750
But don't tell you guys that I missed you guys.

3734
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:41,050
Okay.

3735
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:42,590
This is our little secret.

3736
02:13:45,290 --> 02:13:46,050
Don't tell...

3737
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:49,330
You guys that I missed you guys.

3738
02:13:49,450 --> 02:13:50,330
But I really missed you guys.

3739
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,490
Okay.

3740
02:13:54,910 --> 02:13:55,490
Back off.

3741
02:13:55,570 --> 02:13:56,310
She only missed me.

3742
02:13:56,810 --> 02:13:57,070
Yeah.

3743
02:13:57,190 --> 02:13:57,990
I do miss you better.

3744
02:13:58,130 --> 02:13:58,250
Yeah.

3745
02:13:58,270 --> 02:13:59,490
I can't wait for us to hang out again.

3746
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:05,150
OTP Lady Winchester x Vincent Van Gogh.

3747
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:07,390
I think they would have been a great couple.

3748
02:14:08,370 --> 02:14:09,850
Because they're both weeaboos.

3749
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:17,900
I didn't think I would get this far.

3750
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:22,810
Nah.

3751
02:14:23,330 --> 02:14:23,930
And...

3752
02:14:23,930 --> 02:14:24,630
Oh my gosh.

3753
02:14:25,130 --> 02:14:26,030
Sarah Winchester.

3754
02:14:26,030 --> 02:14:26,970
She was so cool.

3755
02:14:27,110 --> 02:14:27,750
She had a dog.

3756
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:30,770
The dog's name was Zap.

3757
02:14:30,970 --> 02:14:31,950
And she had another dog.

3758
02:14:31,950 --> 02:14:33,270
The dog's...

3759
02:14:33,270 --> 02:14:34,630
Other dog's name was Zip.

3760
02:14:35,270 --> 02:14:36,310
Zip and Zap.

3761
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:38,390
Is that not the cutest thing ever?

3762
02:14:39,990 --> 02:14:41,770
I love you, Sarah Winchester.

3763
02:14:42,430 --> 02:14:44,050
She's like my Oshi now.

3764
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:45,410
She's my ghost-she.

3765
02:14:46,350 --> 02:14:47,590
My ghost Oshi.

3766
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:50,590
My ghost-she.

3767
02:14:59,030 --> 02:15:00,410
Sounds like a silly gal.

3768
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:04,970
She also paid her employees so well.

3769
02:15:05,110 --> 02:15:05,730
Put them in her will.

3770
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:06,670
I know, Mary.

3771
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:07,630
We were talking.

3772
02:15:07,810 --> 02:15:08,470
I was like...

3773
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:09,870
I was really like...

3774
02:15:09,870 --> 02:15:11,210
I was hyping her up.

3775
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:11,910
I was like...

3776
02:15:11,910 --> 02:15:13,670
And then Sarah Winchester did this.

3777
02:15:13,790 --> 02:15:15,930
And then she was so kind to these people.

3778
02:15:16,070 --> 02:15:18,130
And then she was so awesome like this.

3779
02:15:18,130 --> 02:15:19,090
I was like...

3780
02:15:19,090 --> 02:15:20,410
I was really hyping her up.

3781
02:15:23,110 --> 02:15:25,150
Everybody support Sarah Winchester.

3782
02:15:26,270 --> 02:15:27,890
Did you ever see the Winchester movie?

3783
02:15:28,050 --> 02:15:29,490
I feel like I...

3784
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:30,570
Did see it.

3785
02:15:30,630 --> 02:15:31,130
There was a...

3786
02:15:31,130 --> 02:15:32,290
There was a big ol'...

3787
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:33,110
What's it called?

3788
02:15:33,370 --> 02:15:35,670
A big ol' movie poster for it.

3789
02:15:35,990 --> 02:15:36,850
In the house.

3790
02:15:37,910 --> 02:15:39,590
And I feel like I saw it.

3791
02:15:39,950 --> 02:15:40,830
But I don't...

3792
02:15:40,830 --> 02:15:41,690
I remember...

3793
02:15:41,690 --> 02:15:42,750
Watching it.

3794
02:15:42,850 --> 02:15:44,490
But I don't remember it at the same time.

3795
02:15:45,110 --> 02:15:46,750
So I must re-watch it now.

3796
02:15:46,750 --> 02:15:49,490
With my newfound knowledge.

3797
02:15:49,990 --> 02:15:52,010
With my newfound knowledge.

3798
02:15:52,670 --> 02:15:53,330
Now.

3799
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:55,630
And then I will be critical.

3800
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:00,030
There's a movie.

3801
02:16:00,210 --> 02:16:00,330
Yeah.

3802
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:01,430
But it's like...

3803
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:03,870
What is...

3804
02:16:03,870 --> 02:16:04,830
One of those like...

3805
02:16:05,810 --> 02:16:07,750
Horror movies that...

3806
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:10,030
That are like...

3807
02:16:11,970 --> 02:16:13,370
Spooky jump scare.

3808
02:16:13,750 --> 02:16:14,350
Boop boy.

3809
02:16:14,510 --> 02:16:15,310
Kind of deal.

3810
02:16:15,310 --> 02:16:15,910
Oh yeah, you know.

3811
02:16:18,590 --> 02:16:19,270
Oh yeah.

3812
02:16:21,010 --> 02:16:23,270
I don't remember thinking the movie was that good.

3813
02:16:23,610 --> 02:16:24,090
Honestly.

3814
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:27,670
The gift shop had so many real Minto references too.

3815
02:16:27,810 --> 02:16:28,450
I know.

3816
02:16:28,710 --> 02:16:29,250
Oh my gosh.

3817
02:16:29,370 --> 02:16:31,650
I was going insane in the gift shop.

3818
02:16:31,810 --> 02:16:32,670
I did not buy anything.

3819
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:34,310
Because...

3820
02:16:34,310 --> 02:16:34,850
Oh my gosh.

3821
02:16:35,130 --> 02:16:35,510
Guys.

3822
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:37,090
My suitcase was...

3823
02:16:37,970 --> 02:16:39,690
Overweight when I went home.

3824
02:16:42,650 --> 02:16:43,930
I had no room.

3825
02:16:44,090 --> 02:16:46,250
I thought there was one thing that I was saving room for.

3826
02:16:46,670 --> 02:16:47,470
In Japan.

3827
02:16:47,810 --> 02:16:48,950
That I really wanted to buy.

3828
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:49,990
And I couldn't buy.

3829
02:16:50,550 --> 02:16:51,930
Because I had no room.

3830
02:16:59,610 --> 02:17:00,810
Did it weigh more than you?

3831
02:17:00,990 --> 02:17:01,670
I don't think so.

3832
02:17:01,670 --> 02:17:02,810
Well, actually it must.

3833
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:04,290
Because I weigh zero pounds.

3834
02:17:06,190 --> 02:17:07,030
I'm a ghost.

3835
02:17:09,430 --> 02:17:11,210
I have a technical interview tomorrow.

3836
02:17:11,850 --> 02:17:13,110
What's a technical interview?

3837
02:17:13,530 --> 02:17:14,470
Hoping to get the job.

3838
02:17:14,570 --> 02:17:15,910
So I can go to events with even...

3839
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:17,930
With the go-to events with more wisps.

3840
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:18,690
Here's hoping...

3841
02:17:18,690 --> 02:17:19,390
Virgil!

3842
02:17:19,390 --> 02:17:21,450
Virgil, you got this.

3843
02:17:22,050 --> 02:17:22,330
Virgil!

3844
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,150
Virgil!

3845
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:23,910
Virgil!

3846
02:17:24,050 --> 02:17:24,730
Virgil!

3847
02:17:25,250 --> 02:17:25,930
Virgil!

3848
02:17:26,210 --> 02:17:26,890
Virgil!

3849
02:17:27,030 --> 02:17:27,670
Virgil!

3850
02:17:27,870 --> 02:17:30,470
Virgil, you're going to ace this technical interview.

3851
02:17:33,170 --> 02:17:33,650
You!

3852
02:17:35,430 --> 02:17:36,670
This is the...

3853
02:17:36,670 --> 02:17:37,430
This is the...

3854
02:17:37,430 --> 02:17:38,410
This is the...

3855
02:17:38,410 --> 02:17:40,090
Ace your interview.

3856
02:17:41,010 --> 02:17:41,350
Beeeeeem!

3857
02:17:42,990 --> 02:17:44,510
This is the...

3858
02:17:44,510 --> 02:17:46,710
Pass your interview and get your job.

3859
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:48,330
Beeeeeem!

3860
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:52,170
To you.

3861
02:17:59,430 --> 02:18:01,050
Where's your motivation?

3862
02:18:12,890 --> 02:18:14,390
What else did I do?

3863
02:18:14,990 --> 02:18:17,130
Everything feels like a fever dream.

3864
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:18,290
There is so much everything.

3865
02:18:19,810 --> 02:18:20,930
That happened.

3866
02:18:22,470 --> 02:18:23,170
Motivated.

3867
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:26,230
Where's your motivation?

3868
02:18:30,470 --> 02:18:32,110
What else did I do?

3869
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:34,070
I did so much.

3870
02:18:37,250 --> 02:18:39,530
But there was also so many things I wanted to do.

3871
02:18:39,650 --> 02:18:40,490
And could not.

3872
02:18:43,070 --> 02:18:44,510
How are the cats?

3873
02:18:46,490 --> 02:18:47,090
Stinky.

3874
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:49,950
They're good.

3875
02:18:53,810 --> 02:18:58,290
They were all snuggled up with me last night.

3876
02:18:59,290 --> 02:19:00,790
They were so sweet.

3877
02:19:03,630 --> 02:19:04,210
Yeah.

3878
02:19:04,770 --> 02:19:05,110
Yeah.

3879
02:19:08,590 --> 02:19:09,890
Were they Tindere when he got home?

3880
02:19:10,010 --> 02:19:10,610
Not really.

3881
02:19:10,910 --> 02:19:11,070
No.

3882
02:19:11,410 --> 02:19:12,950
They were all snuggled up with me.

3883
02:19:14,850 --> 02:19:15,430
Yeah.

3884
02:19:15,770 --> 02:19:16,830
Butaro's doing well.

3885
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:19,690
Butaro pause.

3886
02:19:20,050 --> 02:19:21,490
They're both being good babies.

3887
02:19:23,490 --> 02:19:23,990
Yeah.

3888
02:19:24,850 --> 02:19:27,010
So I was really... I was really relieved.

3889
02:19:27,290 --> 02:19:29,190
Because I was very worried about Butaro.

3890
02:19:30,410 --> 02:19:33,870
Because... He... He gets very stressed when I leave.

3891
02:19:34,050 --> 02:19:36,030
And I was like... I'm leaving for such a long time.

3892
02:19:37,530 --> 02:19:41,770
So... I'm taking the... The mixed exams tomorrow.

3893
02:19:41,930 --> 02:19:43,110
To study fashion in Japan.

3894
02:19:43,470 --> 02:19:45,170
So I can see my Oshis every day.

3895
02:19:45,350 --> 02:19:45,730
Oh my gosh.

3896
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:46,210
Lila.

3897
02:19:46,650 --> 02:19:47,170
You're rolling.

3898
02:19:49,370 --> 02:19:51,250
Good luck to everyone having interviews and exams.

3899
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:51,790
Good luck.

3900
02:19:52,130 --> 02:19:53,350
Good luck with your exam.

3901
02:19:55,070 --> 02:19:55,890
You'll pass.

3902
02:19:56,330 --> 02:19:57,430
You will pass.

3903
02:19:59,130 --> 02:20:00,610
I worry about that though.

3904
02:20:00,770 --> 02:20:02,630
If I were to live in Japan...

3905
02:20:03,590 --> 02:20:04,450
I don't know though.

3906
02:20:04,510 --> 02:20:05,590
I could stream in the morning.

3907
02:20:05,870 --> 02:20:07,610
And then go see my Oshis at night.

3908
02:20:09,750 --> 02:20:11,770
It seems kind of like a dream.

3909
02:20:14,850 --> 02:20:15,870
I don't know.

3910
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:26,040
But my wallet would say, oh no.

3911
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:35,320
Calling all your cats.

3912
02:20:35,960 --> 02:20:37,500
Calling your cats over.

3913
02:20:43,420 --> 02:20:45,100
Don't remind me.

3914
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:49,080
Oh my gosh, I'm going to cry again.

3915
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:52,620
Did you see the mint and Matara dolls at Afghai?

3916
02:20:52,740 --> 02:20:53,320
They were like...

3917
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:53,740
2K!

3918
02:20:55,960 --> 02:20:56,320
2...2...2...

3919
02:20:56,320 --> 02:20:58,860
Not $2...2K dollars.

3920
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:00,680
And three feet tall.

3921
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:02,300
The mint one was basically one to one...

3922
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:02,940
Don't say that.

3923
02:21:03,620 --> 02:21:04,160
Wait a second.

3924
02:21:04,220 --> 02:21:05,100
I did not see those.

3925
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,300
Don't say it was one to one.

3926
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:09,660
I am... I am much taller than three feet.

3927
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:16,330
You should call the wisps your kittens.

3928
02:21:16,510 --> 02:21:16,910
Haha, JK.

3929
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:17,550
I'm just kidding.

3930
02:21:17,750 --> 02:21:18,570
Haha, what if you do?

3931
02:21:18,690 --> 02:21:19,570
Haha, JK though.

3932
02:21:25,070 --> 02:21:26,230
Hello, kitten.

3933
02:21:31,610 --> 02:21:33,450
Hello, my kitten.

3934
02:21:34,530 --> 02:21:36,250
My little kittens.

3935
02:21:37,510 --> 02:21:37,730
Hello.

3936
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:40,310
Umm...Princess?

3937
02:21:42,570 --> 02:21:43,530
Umm...Princess?

3938
02:21:44,450 --> 02:21:48,150
Why haven't you Discord called me yet, princess?

3939
02:22:04,690 --> 02:22:08,130
Would you like some catnip as a tweet?

3940
02:22:09,490 --> 02:22:10,450
Hmm...Princess?

3941
02:22:17,430 --> 02:22:17,950
Raiders!

3942
02:22:18,190 --> 02:22:18,250
Raiders!

3943
02:22:18,250 --> 02:22:18,470
Uh-oh.

3944
02:22:19,670 --> 02:22:20,190
Uh...

3945
02:22:20,190 --> 02:22:20,850
Waiters.

3946
02:22:22,550 --> 02:22:23,070
Um...

3947
02:22:23,070 --> 02:22:23,690
Waiters.

3948
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:25,630
Welcome in.

3949
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:26,850
Meow, meow, meow.

3950
02:22:27,130 --> 02:22:27,650
That's...

3951
02:22:27,650 --> 02:22:28,970
Yes, please, meow for me.

3952
02:22:29,430 --> 02:22:29,950
Like...

3953
02:22:29,950 --> 02:22:31,890
Oh, good kitten you are.

3954
02:22:32,150 --> 02:22:35,190
If I scratch you under your chin, do you purr?

3955
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:41,050
If I scratch you under your chin, will you purr?

3956
02:22:41,050 --> 02:22:42,790
Like the good kitten that you are.

3957
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,240
Put your...

3958
02:23:08,300 --> 02:23:10,960
Put your WhatsApp in my iPhone 16.

3959
02:23:14,980 --> 02:23:15,900
Korean guy...

3960
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:17,460
Oh gosh, I can't remember.

3961
02:23:18,540 --> 02:23:19,740
There's like a meme.

3962
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:20,920
Like guys...

3963
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:23,360
Korean guys in this area are always like...

3964
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:23,860
Put your...

3965
02:23:23,860 --> 02:23:26,060
Put your WhatsApp in my iPhone.

3966
02:23:27,800 --> 02:23:29,260
Guess I'm a cat now.

3967
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:32,580
The Hongdae guy!

3968
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:32,940
Yay!

3969
02:23:39,940 --> 02:23:41,060
I need to take you.

3970
02:23:41,200 --> 02:23:41,860
I don't wanna go.

3971
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:43,180
I don't wanna put my...

3972
02:23:43,180 --> 02:23:43,500
My...

3973
02:23:43,500 --> 02:23:44,780
I don't even have WhatsApp!

3974
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:49,600
They're gonna ask for my WhatsApp and I say I don't have.

3975
02:23:50,340 --> 02:23:51,220
Thank you ma'am.

3976
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:52,100
Don't do that again.

3977
02:23:52,100 --> 02:23:52,380
Yeah!

3978
02:23:55,060 --> 02:23:56,760
Thank you not white Adam.

3979
02:23:56,940 --> 02:23:57,360
Thank you for the...

3980
02:24:07,460 --> 02:24:08,480
I don't have WhatsApp!

3981
02:24:09,540 --> 02:24:10,800
Oh my gosh, you guys.

3982
02:24:11,220 --> 02:24:12,680
I left...

3983
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:13,370
I left...

3984
02:24:14,960 --> 02:24:15,500
Before...

3985
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:15,980
I left...

3986
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:19,300
I left telling you guys that my mom got pickpocket!

3987
02:24:21,040 --> 02:24:24,820
Today I learned the story about my mom's pickpocket experience.

3988
02:24:24,820 --> 02:24:26,580
And it's so much worse...

3989
02:24:28,200 --> 02:24:28,720
Than...

3990
02:24:28,720 --> 02:24:29,960
What I imagined.

3991
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:34,600
So for those that don't know...

3992
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:35,460
My mom...

3993
02:24:35,460 --> 02:24:36,700
Went to Italy.

3994
02:24:39,340 --> 02:24:39,860
And...

3995
02:24:39,860 --> 02:24:40,840
Day...

3996
02:24:40,840 --> 02:24:41,180
One...

3997
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:42,480
She said I'm leaving for Italy!

3998
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:44,040
Day two...

3999
02:24:44,040 --> 02:24:45,500
She said I arrived in Italy!

4000
02:24:46,940 --> 02:24:47,460
Day...

4001
02:24:47,460 --> 02:24:48,420
Three...

4002
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,920
I get a text from an unknown number that said...

4003
02:24:50,920 --> 02:24:51,600
This is your mom!

4004
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:54,460
I got pickpocketed and all my stuff was stolen in Italy!

4005
02:24:57,920 --> 02:24:59,360
And today I got an update.

4006
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:02,100
So she told...

4007
02:25:02,100 --> 02:25:02,640
I was like...

4008
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:02,800
What?

4009
02:25:03,240 --> 02:25:04,120
What happened?

4010
02:25:07,240 --> 02:25:08,140
What happened?

4011
02:25:08,440 --> 02:25:09,800
What happened to your stuff?

4012
02:25:10,760 --> 02:25:11,950
And she was like...

4013
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:13,320
Okay...

4014
02:25:13,320 --> 02:25:14,240
Oh my gosh...

4015
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:14,900
I could...

4016
02:25:14,900 --> 02:25:15,520
First of all...

4017
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:17,400
I'm going to explain it very badly...

4018
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:20,120
Because I could not even follow what she was telling me.

4019
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:22,720
She's still in Italy.

4020
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:24,060
No, no, she's back now.

4021
02:25:24,820 --> 02:25:26,820
I could not follow what she was saying.

4022
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:28,740
So she...

4023
02:25:28,740 --> 02:25:30,260
Not the lick pocket!

4024
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:30,780
No!

4025
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:34,480
So...

4026
02:25:34,480 --> 02:25:37,060
She said that there was something that happened...

4027
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:37,860
She was like...

4028
02:25:37,860 --> 02:25:40,240
Her plane or her train...

4029
02:25:40,920 --> 02:25:41,940
Was delayed.

4030
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:43,020
Which I was like...

4031
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:43,360
What does...

4032
02:25:43,360 --> 02:25:43,800
She was like...

4033
02:25:43,800 --> 02:25:45,040
It all started with that.

4034
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:45,620
And I was like...

4035
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:47,560
What does that have to do with you getting pickpocketed?

4036
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:48,860
And she's like...

4037
02:25:48,860 --> 02:25:49,880
We had a bunch of...

4038
02:25:49,880 --> 02:25:51,240
So my mom went with a tour...

4039
02:25:51,240 --> 02:25:52,460
A group of people, right?

4040
02:25:53,660 --> 02:25:54,500
She was like...

4041
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:56,020
We had a bunch of suitcases.

4042
02:25:56,240 --> 02:25:56,720
And I was like...

4043
02:25:57,740 --> 02:25:58,060
Okay...

4044
02:25:58,640 --> 02:25:59,220
She was like...

4045
02:25:59,220 --> 02:26:00,920
They needed to go up an escalator.

4046
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:01,880
Okay?

4047
02:26:02,300 --> 02:26:03,220
And she was like...

4048
02:26:04,540 --> 02:26:06,520
Some kind people...

4049
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,500
Came over and started...

4050
02:26:08,500 --> 02:26:10,460
Picking up our suitcases for us...

4051
02:26:10,460 --> 02:26:11,120
And moving them.

4052
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,580
I was like...

4053
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:12,840
Oh...

4054
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:13,040
No!

4055
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:16,820
I was like...

4056
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:17,000
No!

4057
02:26:17,220 --> 02:26:17,880
No, mom!

4058
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:18,400
No!

4059
02:26:22,620 --> 02:26:23,480
And she was like...

4060
02:26:23,480 --> 02:26:24,880
My first thought was...

4061
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:25,580
They're angels!

4062
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:26,200
Oh my gosh!

4063
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:27,420
They're helping us!

4064
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:29,540
Oh...

4065
02:26:30,180 --> 02:26:30,600
Literally...

4066
02:26:34,040 --> 02:26:34,460
Oh...

4067
02:26:34,460 --> 02:26:35,000
And so then...

4068
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:35,620
She was like...

4069
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:37,040
I was going up the escalator...

4070
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:38,600
And there was one guy helping me...

4071
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:39,700
And then he...

4072
02:26:39,700 --> 02:26:42,080
Dropped the thing he was holding...

4073
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:42,840
But then also...

4074
02:26:43,360 --> 02:26:45,720
She got up to the top of the escalator...

4075
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,680
And there was a guy on a bike...

4076
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:48,160
That...

4077
02:26:48,160 --> 02:26:50,080
Hit her in the head...

4078
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:52,300
With the handle of the bike!

4079
02:26:55,680 --> 02:26:58,080
And that also caused the guy...

4080
02:26:58,080 --> 02:26:59,480
That was helping her to...

4081
02:26:59,480 --> 02:26:59,900
Bolt?

4082
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:02,860
And it made her drop her stuff...

4083
02:27:02,860 --> 02:27:04,820
And then the guy flicked her off...

4084
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:06,360
And then she was like...

4085
02:27:06,360 --> 02:27:08,040
Going to pick up her stuff...

4086
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:09,180
And...

4087
02:27:09,180 --> 02:27:09,600
S...

4088
02:27:09,600 --> 02:27:10,300
Another...

4089
02:27:10,300 --> 02:27:11,900
There was another group of...

4090
02:27:11,900 --> 02:27:14,360
Of people that rushed her...

4091
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:15,840
And then...

4092
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:17,200
She was picking up stuff...

4093
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:18,820
And someone was like...

4094
02:27:18,820 --> 02:27:19,020
No!

4095
02:27:19,360 --> 02:27:20,600
Don't pick up that stuff!

4096
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:23,120
That guy just robbed you!

4097
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:27,980
And...

4098
02:27:36,260 --> 02:27:37,500
I don't understand!

4099
02:27:37,500 --> 02:27:38,320
At all!

4100
02:27:40,640 --> 02:27:41,920
That ain't a pickpocket!

4101
02:27:42,060 --> 02:27:42,680
That's a mugging!

4102
02:27:42,860 --> 02:27:43,120
I...

4103
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:43,600
Right!

4104
02:27:44,400 --> 02:27:45,400
I'm like...

4105
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:45,740
This...

4106
02:27:45,740 --> 02:27:46,640
I'm like...

4107
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:46,920
What...

4108
02:27:46,920 --> 02:27:47,880
What are you...

4109
02:27:47,880 --> 02:27:48,380
What are you...

4110
02:27:48,380 --> 02:27:49,900
It just kept getting worse and worse!

4111
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:50,820
And she was just like...

4112
02:27:50,820 --> 02:27:52,800
I was knocked down the escalator!

4113
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:54,280
And all my stuff...

4114
02:27:54,280 --> 02:27:55,600
Tumbled down the escalator!

4115
02:27:56,340 --> 02:27:57,200
And this and that...

4116
02:27:57,200 --> 02:27:58,400
Down the escalator!

4117
02:27:58,400 --> 02:27:59,460
I was like...

4118
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:00,400
I was like...

4119
02:28:03,020 --> 02:28:03,900
Oh...

4120
02:28:03,900 --> 02:28:05,080
I...

4121
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,280
Oh...

4122
02:28:06,280 --> 02:28:08,020
So I guess my mom got mugged...

4123
02:28:08,020 --> 02:28:08,760
And not...

4124
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:09,500
Um...

4125
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:10,680
Pickpocketed...

4126
02:28:11,940 --> 02:28:12,940
And she was like...

4127
02:28:12,940 --> 02:28:14,040
There was a whole group of people...

4128
02:28:14,040 --> 02:28:15,080
Caused a diversion...

4129
02:28:15,080 --> 02:28:16,240
For the guy to take my stuff!

4130
02:28:18,740 --> 02:28:19,500
That's insane!

4131
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:20,600
Glad your mom...

4132
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:21,700
Mom's home safe!

4133
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:22,380
I know!

4134
02:28:23,800 --> 02:28:24,200
I...

4135
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:25,840
I couldn't follow her story...

4136
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:27,400
Because there was just so much happening...

4137
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:27,940
All at once!

4138
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:28,880
And she was like...

4139
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:30,880
It all happened within the span of 10 seconds!

4140
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:34,660
The confusion is the method!

4141
02:28:34,860 --> 02:28:35,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4142
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:36,720
I've heard about that before!

4143
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:38,300
But...

4144
02:28:38,300 --> 02:28:39,560
The first thing that she...

4145
02:28:39,560 --> 02:28:41,340
Should've done is not had anybody touch her stuff!

4146
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,550
And...

4147
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:48,710
I was helping her out today...

4148
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:49,210
Because...

4149
02:28:49,210 --> 02:28:49,990
The phone that...

4150
02:28:49,990 --> 02:28:51,370
Got stolen was...

4151
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:52,590
A gift from me!

4152
02:28:54,250 --> 02:28:54,770
No!

4153
02:28:54,850 --> 02:28:56,030
She didn't recover anything!

4154
02:28:56,770 --> 02:28:57,150
Nope!

4155
02:28:57,970 --> 02:28:58,330
But...

4156
02:28:58,750 --> 02:28:59,010
So...

4157
02:28:59,010 --> 02:28:59,770
She was just like...

4158
02:28:59,770 --> 02:29:00,310
I need...

4159
02:29:00,310 --> 02:29:01,470
I need the receipts...

4160
02:29:01,470 --> 02:29:02,870
From when you bought it...

4161
02:29:02,870 --> 02:29:03,690
To...

4162
02:29:03,690 --> 02:29:05,850
To file a claim...

4163
02:29:07,090 --> 02:29:07,950
And everything!

4164
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:10,350
So I was going through all my old...

4165
02:29:10,350 --> 02:29:10,830
Everything!

4166
02:29:10,830 --> 02:29:11,370
Oh!

4167
02:29:11,970 --> 02:29:13,190
So try and find...

4168
02:29:13,830 --> 02:29:14,050
Receipts!

4169
02:29:14,870 --> 02:29:15,310
So...

4170
02:29:15,710 --> 02:29:17,750
That's typically the type of organized crime!

4171
02:29:18,190 --> 02:29:18,370
Oh!

4172
02:29:19,270 --> 02:29:20,970
I'm used to in third world countries...

4173
02:29:20,970 --> 02:29:21,430
But not Italy!

4174
02:29:21,910 --> 02:29:22,350
Apparently...

4175
02:29:22,350 --> 02:29:22,590
Like...

4176
02:29:22,590 --> 02:29:24,290
Those kinds of things are getting more and more elaborate!

4177
02:29:25,570 --> 02:29:27,090
It's like the friendship bracelets!

4178
02:29:27,230 --> 02:29:27,430
You know?

4179
02:29:27,430 --> 02:29:28,190
They were like...

4180
02:29:28,190 --> 02:29:29,690
Grab you and put a bracelet on you...

4181
02:29:29,690 --> 02:29:30,050
And like...

4182
02:29:30,050 --> 02:29:30,990
We're friends now!

4183
02:29:30,990 --> 02:29:32,030
I saw...

4184
02:29:32,030 --> 02:29:33,490
I saw even a TikTok recently...

4185
02:29:33,490 --> 02:29:34,330
Of a girl...

4186
02:29:34,330 --> 02:29:34,810
Who was like...

4187
02:29:34,810 --> 02:29:36,710
Crying in front of the Eiffel Tower...

4188
02:29:36,710 --> 02:29:37,330
Because...

4189
02:29:37,330 --> 02:29:38,030
She got...

4190
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:38,470
She was like...

4191
02:29:38,470 --> 02:29:39,470
I got scammed!

4192
02:29:39,590 --> 02:29:40,690
And it was one of those...

4193
02:29:40,690 --> 02:29:41,850
Guys that were like...

4194
02:29:41,850 --> 02:29:42,470
Doing the...

4195
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:42,910
You know?

4196
02:29:42,970 --> 02:29:44,670
Where you put a ball under a cup...

4197
02:29:44,670 --> 02:29:45,070
And like...

4198
02:29:45,070 --> 02:29:46,430
Turn the cups around...

4199
02:29:46,430 --> 02:29:48,850
And you try to guess which one has the ball under it...

4200
02:29:48,850 --> 02:29:49,230
Like...

4201
02:29:49,230 --> 02:29:49,790
Just stuff like...

4202
02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:50,150
Like...

4203
02:29:50,150 --> 02:29:51,310
My lesson...

4204
02:29:51,310 --> 02:29:51,770
Is...

4205
02:29:51,770 --> 02:29:53,310
Don't talk to anybody...

4206
02:29:54,650 --> 02:29:56,790
Maybe that's why everybody's so standoffish...

4207
02:29:57,550 --> 02:29:59,890
Cause you never know who's just out to...

4208
02:29:59,890 --> 02:30:01,550
Who's out to...

4209
02:30:01,550 --> 02:30:05,390
Get ya...

4210
02:30:05,390 --> 02:30:08,250
Papa Ghost wants me to join him on a trip to Italy next year...

4211
02:30:08,250 --> 02:30:09,050
And now I'm hearing this...

4212
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:09,830
I think I'll pass...

4213
02:30:09,830 --> 02:30:11,010
I'll go to Japan instead!

4214
02:30:13,650 --> 02:30:15,750
Don't go to touristy places...

4215
02:30:15,750 --> 02:30:15,990
Yeah...

4216
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:17,750
Maybe...

4217
02:30:20,650 --> 02:30:21,830
I've lost...

4218
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:23,330
Two things in Japan before...

4219
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:25,270
First was my phone...

4220
02:30:26,390 --> 02:30:28,570
Second was a jacket...

4221
02:30:28,570 --> 02:30:30,210
And I got both back...

4222
02:30:30,810 --> 02:30:33,470
I can't say that that would happen in...

4223
02:30:33,470 --> 02:30:34,310
A lot of countries...

4224
02:30:36,930 --> 02:30:38,750
The first time I was buying my...

4225
02:30:38,750 --> 02:30:39,710
My train ticket...

4226
02:30:39,710 --> 02:30:40,770
And I left my phone...

4227
02:30:40,770 --> 02:30:41,330
Where you...

4228
02:30:41,330 --> 02:30:43,290
Where you buy the ticket at...

4229
02:30:43,290 --> 02:30:44,150
And...

4230
02:30:44,150 --> 02:30:45,370
I forgot to grab it...

4231
02:30:46,110 --> 02:30:47,170
And I...

4232
02:30:47,170 --> 02:30:48,250
Went to the...

4233
02:30:48,250 --> 02:30:48,870
Train...

4234
02:30:50,330 --> 02:30:50,850
Place...

4235
02:30:50,850 --> 02:30:51,370
The...

4236
02:30:51,370 --> 02:30:51,670
The...

4237
02:30:51,670 --> 02:30:52,910
The guys...

4238
02:30:52,910 --> 02:30:53,190
The...

4239
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:54,410
Train security, I guess?

4240
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:56,110
And...

4241
02:30:56,110 --> 02:30:56,710
It was there!

4242
02:30:57,730 --> 02:30:59,910
Had a guy in DC trying to make us...

4243
02:30:59,910 --> 02:31:00,590
Take bracelets...

4244
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:00,750
Yeah!

4245
02:31:01,250 --> 02:31:01,870
Yeah, yeah!

4246
02:31:01,930 --> 02:31:02,950
They do it in New York too!

4247
02:31:04,250 --> 02:31:04,770
Rube...

4248
02:31:05,770 --> 02:31:06,290
Goldberg...

4249
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:06,770
Mugging...

4250
02:31:06,770 --> 02:31:07,210
Who's that?

4251
02:31:11,600 --> 02:31:12,120
Nah...

4252
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:13,340
So...

4253
02:31:20,650 --> 02:31:22,590
Don't go to Times Square...

4254
02:31:22,590 --> 02:31:23,470
Ah, it's scary!

4255
02:31:24,490 --> 02:31:25,390
It's scary!

4256
02:31:25,930 --> 02:31:26,810
Reminds me of a story...

4257
02:31:26,810 --> 02:31:27,050
Reminds me of a story...

4258
02:31:27,050 --> 02:31:28,770
Where signs with beware pickpocketers...

4259
02:31:28,770 --> 02:31:29,330
And ironically...

4260
02:31:29,330 --> 02:31:30,090
The source of pickp...

4261
02:31:30,090 --> 02:31:30,730
Really?

4262
02:31:32,310 --> 02:31:33,370
I don't know...

4263
02:31:33,370 --> 02:31:34,890
I feel like I'm too...

4264
02:31:34,890 --> 02:31:36,710
Trusting of people...

4265
02:31:36,710 --> 02:31:38,530
Like I'm very gullible...

4266
02:31:38,530 --> 02:31:39,390
And naive...

4267
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:40,390
About that kind of stuff...

4268
02:31:41,970 --> 02:31:43,690
You might not believe me...

4269
02:31:43,690 --> 02:31:44,030
I...

4270
02:31:44,030 --> 02:31:46,510
Those things that are just like...

4271
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:46,950
Oh...

4272
02:31:46,950 --> 02:31:47,450
There's...

4273
02:31:47,450 --> 02:31:49,430
Stupid written on the ceiling...

4274
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:50,290
I look up!

4275
02:31:54,230 --> 02:31:55,950
I feel like I would...

4276
02:31:55,950 --> 02:31:57,030
Get in trouble...

4277
02:32:02,960 --> 02:32:04,540
If someone tells me something...

4278
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:04,840
I...

4279
02:32:04,840 --> 02:32:07,020
Am more inclined to believe them...

4280
02:32:07,020 --> 02:32:08,040
Than not...

4281
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:09,680
And so people will be like...

4282
02:32:09,680 --> 02:32:10,100
Like...

4283
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:11,760
People will tell me a story...

4284
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:12,600
And I'll be like...

4285
02:32:12,600 --> 02:32:13,140
Really?

4286
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:14,960
And they'll be like...

4287
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:15,160
No!

4288
02:32:18,380 --> 02:32:19,700
Rube Goldberg...

4289
02:32:19,700 --> 02:32:21,100
Like those complex machines...

4290
02:32:21,100 --> 02:32:22,220
Of random objects...

4291
02:32:22,220 --> 02:32:23,140
With circus music...

4292
02:32:23,800 --> 02:32:25,140
I'm gonna look this up...

4293
02:32:32,400 --> 02:32:34,400
Rube Goldberg machine...

4294
02:32:35,580 --> 02:32:36,140
Oh!

4295
02:32:36,820 --> 02:32:37,160
Yeah!

4296
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:39,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4297
02:32:41,360 --> 02:32:43,400
It did seem like that...

4298
02:32:44,220 --> 02:32:46,260
You have silly written on your forehead...

4299
02:32:46,260 --> 02:32:46,540
Stop!

4300
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:51,660
Stop it!

4301
02:32:52,300 --> 02:32:52,900
Vinto is cute!

4302
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:53,760
Do you believe this?

4303
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:54,080
No!

4304
02:32:55,180 --> 02:32:56,040
No, I don't!

4305
02:32:57,460 --> 02:32:58,900
We totally believe you...

4306
02:32:58,900 --> 02:33:00,140
It's a sign you're a really good...

4307
02:33:00,140 --> 02:33:01,400
And honest person...

4308
02:33:02,460 --> 02:33:05,240
I don't know about that...

4309
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:06,520
I don't know about that...

4310
02:33:09,900 --> 02:33:10,380
Maria!

4311
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:13,620
Why is everybody coming to visit me today?

4312
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:18,280
Notorious BST!

4313
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:19,280
Thank you for the 10 gift!

4314
02:33:19,560 --> 02:33:20,060
Thank you for the 10 gift!

4315
02:33:20,060 --> 02:33:20,780
Thank you for the 10 gift!

4316
02:33:21,060 --> 02:33:22,340
Thank you so much!

4317
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:24,360
Oh yeah...

4318
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:26,080
I don't know...

4319
02:33:26,080 --> 02:33:28,040
Your shoes are unlaced...

4320
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:28,280
No!

4321
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:32,280
We missed Vinto!

4322
02:33:36,780 --> 02:33:38,460
I had a lot of fun...

4323
02:33:38,460 --> 02:33:39,860
But I'm very, very, very...

4324
02:33:39,860 --> 02:33:41,140
Happy to be back...

4325
02:33:42,760 --> 02:33:43,920
I went on...

4326
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:44,860
Many adventures...

4327
02:33:45,740 --> 02:33:46,860
And many things...

4328
02:33:47,380 --> 02:33:49,180
Stupid is not written on the ceiling...

4329
02:33:49,180 --> 02:33:49,800
I just checked!

4330
02:33:53,600 --> 02:33:55,020
Now I'm happy to be back...

4331
02:33:55,020 --> 02:33:56,860
I've missed streaming so, so much...

4332
02:33:57,380 --> 02:33:59,000
There always comes to a point...

4333
02:33:59,760 --> 02:34:00,360
So...

4334
02:34:00,360 --> 02:34:02,000
It usually is like...

4335
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:03,860
The first week...

4336
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:06,100
I miss streaming like...

4337
02:34:06,100 --> 02:34:06,620
Crazy...

4338
02:34:06,620 --> 02:34:07,000
I'm like...

4339
02:34:07,000 --> 02:34:07,720
I want to stream...

4340
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:08,280
I want to stream...

4341
02:34:08,280 --> 02:34:09,800
I want to stream...

4342
02:34:09,800 --> 02:34:10,560
And then...

4343
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,400
Well, really like...

4344
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:12,480
It depends on how long I'm gone...

4345
02:34:12,480 --> 02:34:12,720
But like...

4346
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:13,420
Week and a half...

4347
02:34:13,420 --> 02:34:13,640
I'm like...

4348
02:34:13,640 --> 02:34:14,200
I want to stream...

4349
02:34:14,200 --> 02:34:14,720
I want to stream...

4350
02:34:14,720 --> 02:34:15,400
I want to stream...

4351
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:16,220
And then...

4352
02:34:16,660 --> 02:34:17,800
The week after...

4353
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:19,860
It feels like I've quit my job...

4354
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:22,180
Like...

4355
02:34:22,180 --> 02:34:22,800
I'm just like...

4356
02:34:22,800 --> 02:34:23,240
Oh...

4357
02:34:23,240 --> 02:34:26,540
I guess I'm never going back to doing that streaming bit.

4358
02:34:27,980 --> 02:34:30,820
I guess I'm just done with it forever.

4359
02:34:31,420 --> 02:34:35,020
Like, it feels like I can never go back because I've been gone for so long.

4360
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,760
And now I'm here and I'm like...

4361
02:34:44,380 --> 02:34:45,540
I'm back at it.

4362
02:34:45,620 --> 02:34:46,160
I feel good.

4363
02:34:48,760 --> 02:34:52,240
Call me water droplets in the air the way I missed a moontown.

4364
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:55,780
I've never heard that one before, Nexi.

4365
02:34:55,900 --> 02:34:56,520
That was pretty good.

4366
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:04,130
How quickly she forgets about us.

4367
02:35:04,970 --> 02:35:05,290
No!

4368
02:35:08,550 --> 02:35:09,510
Honestly, though...

4369
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:10,910
I guess, like...

4370
02:35:11,990 --> 02:35:13,910
So, there was a time...

4371
02:35:15,270 --> 02:35:16,230
Last year...

4372
02:35:16,230 --> 02:35:17,810
I would go to Japan...

4373
02:35:17,810 --> 02:35:20,410
Or rather not last year, but there was a time when I would go to Japan.

4374
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:22,050
And...

4375
02:35:22,050 --> 02:35:24,590
It was a lot of, like, solo travel.

4376
02:35:25,650 --> 02:35:26,530
Solo everything.

4377
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:33,790
And only more recently have I been able to meet up with people or go with friends and things like that.

4378
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:35,610
And...

4379
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:37,470
And...

4380
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:38,550
Um...

4381
02:35:38,550 --> 02:35:40,050
I've been actually, like, having...

4382
02:35:40,050 --> 02:35:43,630
Like, so I think that has made it a little less where I miss it.

4383
02:35:45,890 --> 02:35:46,850
So, so much.

4384
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:48,810
Because before I would just be so lonely.

4385
02:35:49,430 --> 02:35:52,190
Now I'm a little less lonely, so...

4386
02:35:52,190 --> 02:35:54,350
I saw you with Kiara at the recent concert.

4387
02:35:54,490 --> 02:35:55,010
You were super cute.

4388
02:35:55,310 --> 02:35:55,950
Thank you!

4389
02:35:58,090 --> 02:35:58,530
So...

4390
02:35:58,530 --> 02:35:58,910
Yeah.

4391
02:35:58,910 --> 02:36:04,910
Please, God, take all of Minto's stress, triple it, and then triple it again, and give it to the wisp...

4392
02:36:04,910 --> 02:36:06,230
Arigato, arigato.

4393
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:08,710
What is wrong with you?

4394
02:36:08,930 --> 02:36:10,930
Why would you fucking say that?

4395
02:36:24,710 --> 02:36:26,410
Why would you say that?

4396
02:36:32,190 --> 02:36:34,370
I think I could still...

4397
02:36:34,370 --> 02:36:35,570
I still think I...

4398
02:36:35,570 --> 02:36:36,770
Sorry, I just bit my tongue.

4399
02:36:37,030 --> 02:36:37,170
Ow.

4400
02:36:38,710 --> 02:36:40,510
I think I could...

4401
02:36:40,510 --> 02:36:42,530
Take triple time stress still.

4402
02:36:42,970 --> 02:36:44,410
I think I'm not at my limit.

4403
02:36:45,150 --> 02:36:46,850
I wonder what my limit is.

4404
02:36:48,330 --> 02:36:49,530
Let's test it.

4405
02:36:53,610 --> 02:36:54,810
Welcome back, Minto!

4406
02:36:55,350 --> 02:36:59,450
It's fantastic to see and hear your hard work paying off.

4407
02:36:59,590 --> 02:37:01,470
So many neat projects and amazing appearances.

4408
02:37:01,870 --> 02:37:03,950
We're all proud of you, especially for doing it at your own pace.

4409
02:37:04,070 --> 02:37:05,210
Looking forward to your future projects.

4410
02:37:05,310 --> 02:37:05,690
Thank you!

4411
02:37:07,790 --> 02:37:08,930
Don't test it.

4412
02:37:09,210 --> 02:37:10,630
Let's not find that one.

4413
02:37:11,870 --> 02:37:13,050
Why not, you chicken?

4414
02:37:15,990 --> 02:37:17,290
You chicken?

4415
02:37:20,180 --> 02:37:21,530
How far...

4416
02:37:21,530 --> 02:37:23,590
Can my ghost body...

4417
02:37:23,590 --> 02:37:25,270
Go before it breaks?

4418
02:37:26,250 --> 02:37:27,150
Huh?

4419
02:37:37,050 --> 02:37:37,950
Yes.

4420
02:37:45,090 --> 02:37:46,430
Miles, Edgeworth.

4421
02:37:47,130 --> 02:37:49,630
I just hid a deer outside of a...

4422
02:37:49,630 --> 02:37:50,710
Of a...

4423
02:37:50,710 --> 02:37:51,490
Bucky's.

4424
02:37:51,670 --> 02:37:52,130
Intentional.

4425
02:37:52,430 --> 02:37:52,650
Just...

4426
02:37:52,650 --> 02:37:55,430
Pray for me that the game warden will let me keep...

4427
02:37:57,610 --> 02:37:58,470
Miles, Edgeworth!

4428
02:37:58,550 --> 02:37:59,170
You can drive!

4429
02:38:02,850 --> 02:38:03,290
No!

4430
02:38:03,750 --> 02:38:04,190
Oh!

4431
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:04,970
That reminds me.

4432
02:38:05,050 --> 02:38:06,170
I did go to...

4433
02:38:07,250 --> 02:38:08,050
I did not...

4434
02:38:08,050 --> 02:38:09,870
It was not Ace Attorney, but it was...

4435
02:38:09,870 --> 02:38:11,130
Great Ace Attorney.

4436
02:38:11,710 --> 02:38:13,230
There was a collab cafe.

4437
02:38:13,230 --> 02:38:14,830
I went with that with my friend.

4438
02:38:16,410 --> 02:38:16,950
I went with that with my friend.

4439
02:38:16,950 --> 02:38:17,630
And uh...

4440
02:38:17,630 --> 02:38:20,670
I still have not played the great Ace Attorney series yet.

4441
02:38:21,670 --> 02:38:22,210
So...

4442
02:38:22,210 --> 02:38:23,010
Um...

4443
02:38:23,010 --> 02:38:23,850
I was kind of like...

4444
02:38:23,850 --> 02:38:24,790
These characters are cute!

4445
02:38:25,070 --> 02:38:26,730
I don't know anything that's going on.

4446
02:38:27,030 --> 02:38:27,890
KFP chicken...

4447
02:38:29,210 --> 02:38:30,890
How to make minstress.

4448
02:38:31,250 --> 02:38:31,390
How to make minstress.

4449
02:38:31,390 --> 02:38:32,450
Make her take longer breaks.

4450
02:38:32,630 --> 02:38:32,810
Yeah!

4451
02:38:33,430 --> 02:38:34,410
Oh my gosh!

4452
02:38:35,050 --> 02:38:35,890
Oh my gosh!

4453
02:38:35,890 --> 02:38:36,030
Oh my gosh!

4454
02:38:36,290 --> 02:38:38,070
There was a part of off-kite...

4455
02:38:38,070 --> 02:38:39,230
I got really overwhelmed.

4456
02:38:40,050 --> 02:38:41,150
And I was just like...

4457
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:41,390
Oh my gosh!

4458
02:38:41,510 --> 02:38:42,250
Everybody hates me!

4459
02:38:42,550 --> 02:38:43,610
And I went...

4460
02:38:43,610 --> 02:38:45,010
Into a corner and I cried?

4461
02:38:47,410 --> 02:38:48,070
I was like...

4462
02:38:48,070 --> 02:38:48,690
I'm not streaming!

4463
02:38:49,430 --> 02:38:50,430
Everybody hates me!

4464
02:38:55,240 --> 02:38:56,060
And I was like...

4465
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:56,720
Crying!

4466
02:38:57,280 --> 02:38:58,140
My friend was like...

4467
02:38:58,140 --> 02:38:58,820
Why are you crying?

4468
02:38:59,100 --> 02:38:59,780
And I was like...

4469
02:38:59,780 --> 02:39:00,460
Um...

4470
02:39:00,460 --> 02:39:01,420
Don't worry about it!

4471
02:39:08,640 --> 02:39:09,400
I was like...

4472
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:09,860
Oh my god!

4473
02:39:10,500 --> 02:39:11,180
I don't know...

4474
02:39:11,180 --> 02:39:12,300
I'm feeling really overwhelmed!

4475
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:14,660
What if everybody forgets about me and hates me?

4476
02:39:15,020 --> 02:39:15,420
You guys...

4477
02:39:15,420 --> 02:39:16,020
You know...

4478
02:39:16,020 --> 02:39:16,700
You know...

4479
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:18,140
This is kind of a secret...

4480
02:39:18,140 --> 02:39:19,500
But I'm actually really needy, okay?

4481
02:39:22,660 --> 02:39:23,020
Okay...

4482
02:39:29,590 --> 02:39:30,510
Don't tell anybody...

4483
02:39:31,090 --> 02:39:31,330
We

4484
02:39:37,490 --> 02:39:39,150
were literally there to celebrate loving you!

4485
02:39:39,210 --> 02:39:39,970
Why are you like this?

4486
02:39:40,010 --> 02:39:40,450
I don't know!

4487
02:39:40,610 --> 02:39:41,310
I was just like...

4488
02:39:41,310 --> 02:39:41,690
Oh gosh!

4489
02:39:43,230 --> 02:39:44,390
If I don't stream...

4490
02:39:44,390 --> 02:39:45,830
Everybody will forget about me!

4491
02:39:45,950 --> 02:39:46,610
Nobody will like me!

4492
02:39:50,570 --> 02:39:51,450
I shouldn't be here!

4493
02:39:51,510 --> 02:39:52,050
I should be streaming!

4494
02:39:53,010 --> 02:39:53,650
Ah!

4495
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:00,160
Wee!

4496
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:08,160
Ghost haunt for hundreds of years...

4497
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:09,380
Will simply await your return!

4498
02:40:10,060 --> 02:40:10,960
Not all ghosts...

4499
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:19,180
I went to Afkai another time of life because of you!

4500
02:40:19,560 --> 02:40:22,060
Afkai was basically MitCon with all of it...

4501
02:40:22,060 --> 02:40:22,760
No, it wasn't!

4502
02:40:23,280 --> 02:40:24,440
I wasn't a guest!

4503
02:40:30,590 --> 02:40:32,450
Needy streamer overload...

4504
02:40:32,450 --> 02:40:33,210
Maybe that's me!

4505
02:40:34,450 --> 02:40:35,470
Maybe that's why Nyarudah...

4506
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:36,770
Likes me!

4507
02:40:39,570 --> 02:40:40,850
Kangol is based off of me!

4508
02:40:41,150 --> 02:40:41,390
I don't...

4509
02:40:41,390 --> 02:40:41,790
No, I'm just kidding!

4510
02:40:42,010 --> 02:40:42,710
That's a lie!

4511
02:40:43,250 --> 02:40:44,010
That's not true!

4512
02:40:50,110 --> 02:40:52,490
I would not have come to Afkai if not for your presence!

4513
02:40:53,270 --> 02:40:54,070
Don't say that!

4514
02:40:54,710 --> 02:40:55,730
I wasn't there!

4515
02:40:57,430 --> 02:40:58,510
Like, well...

4516
02:40:58,510 --> 02:40:59,290
I was at panels...

4517
02:40:59,290 --> 02:41:01,070
But if I had not been at any panels...

4518
02:41:01,070 --> 02:41:01,770
What would you do?

4519
02:41:04,250 --> 02:41:06,770
Seeing the big Minto outside was fucking crazy!

4520
02:41:07,090 --> 02:41:07,570
I...

4521
02:41:07,570 --> 02:41:09,570
Okay, so they asked...

4522
02:41:10,210 --> 02:41:11,670
So Maria was just like...

4523
02:41:12,210 --> 02:41:12,710
Or not...

4524
02:41:12,710 --> 02:41:13,270
Or I was...

4525
02:41:13,270 --> 02:41:14,410
Yeah, they were like...

4526
02:41:14,410 --> 02:41:16,690
Can we put up a big Minto...

4527
02:41:16,690 --> 02:41:18,790
Outside during Afkai?

4528
02:41:19,310 --> 02:41:19,610
For...

4529
02:41:19,610 --> 02:41:20,870
For Fantastic Reality?

4530
02:41:21,810 --> 02:41:22,990
And I was like, yeah!

4531
02:41:23,570 --> 02:41:25,930
Thinking that everybody would have one!

4532
02:41:27,670 --> 02:41:28,750
I was like, yeah!

4533
02:41:28,910 --> 02:41:30,310
We're all gonna have...

4534
02:41:30,310 --> 02:41:33,350
Big standees for Fantastic Reality!

4535
02:41:34,050 --> 02:41:35,770
And then it was just me!

4536
02:41:39,130 --> 02:41:40,270
I was like, no!

4537
02:41:41,010 --> 02:41:43,250
Where's the rest of everybody else?

4538
02:41:47,530 --> 02:41:48,210
What's that?

4539
02:41:49,490 --> 02:41:50,910
I felt too much pressure...

4540
02:42:08,770 --> 02:42:11,190
I guess it's... I guess.

4541
02:42:14,310 --> 02:42:15,370
Thank you, JP.

4542
02:42:15,730 --> 02:42:16,330
Thank you.

4543
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:20,810
Orange for fire to burn the brain word.

4544
02:42:23,230 --> 02:42:25,630
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson?

4545
02:42:25,830 --> 02:42:28,670
I have brain worms!

4546
02:42:31,490 --> 02:42:32,490
There's... There...

4547
02:42:33,150 --> 02:42:34,710
It's like a tapeworm!

4548
02:42:35,230 --> 02:42:36,150
It's very long!

4549
02:42:37,670 --> 02:42:40,150
My brain worms are well fed, okay?

4550
02:42:55,970 --> 02:42:57,010
Oh, you were gone?

4551
02:42:57,110 --> 02:42:57,990
Totally didn't even notice.

4552
02:42:58,130 --> 02:42:58,950
Didn't miss you or anything?

4553
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:06,250
Yeah...

4554
02:43:08,050 --> 02:43:13,170
You might not have been a guest officially, but getting spat on by you was a highlight of my trip.

4555
02:43:14,490 --> 02:43:16,150
Glad I could spit on you, Tuna.

4556
02:43:18,970 --> 02:43:20,290
Yeah, that was fun.

4557
02:43:20,610 --> 02:43:21,770
I really liked the spit and green.

4558
02:43:22,110 --> 02:43:24,210
It was like the... It felt so...

4559
02:43:24,210 --> 02:43:26,770
It was... It was like the silliest thing.

4560
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:29,710
That it felt... It didn't even feel weird.

4561
02:43:29,730 --> 02:43:30,610
It was just goofy.

4562
02:43:32,610 --> 02:43:36,570
It was actually so much more wholesome, I feel, than it was...

4563
02:43:36,570 --> 02:43:37,570
Than it was weird.

4564
02:43:38,630 --> 02:43:40,770
Like, everybody would be like...

4565
02:43:40,770 --> 02:43:43,130
And everybody's reactions were so fun!

4566
02:43:43,830 --> 02:43:46,970
Like, I would spit and then they would be like...

4567
02:43:49,130 --> 02:43:50,550
And then they would laugh!

4568
02:43:50,870 --> 02:43:51,630
And I was like...

4569
02:43:51,630 --> 02:43:52,670
This is so wholesome!

4570
02:43:52,890 --> 02:43:53,730
Everybody's laughing!

4571
02:43:55,870 --> 02:43:57,510
It felt actually so good.

4572
02:43:57,850 --> 02:43:58,910
Don't say that, Barry.

4573
02:43:59,270 --> 02:44:00,250
Go away, actually.

4574
02:44:01,630 --> 02:44:03,490
I regret giving you a wrench.

4575
02:44:03,850 --> 02:44:04,150
Maybe.

4576
02:44:06,030 --> 02:44:08,870
A brick to my head could not make me forget you.

4577
02:44:09,550 --> 02:44:10,490
Don't say that.

4578
02:44:10,490 --> 02:44:11,350
I mean...

4579
02:44:11,350 --> 02:44:12,090
You wanna test that out?

4580
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:19,090
I spent three days off Kai in a giant foam wisp suit.

4581
02:44:19,090 --> 02:44:31,010

4584
02:44:57,700 --> 02:44:59,340
Props again from Motominto.

4585
02:45:05,870 --> 02:45:07,290
You guys are so fine.

4586
02:45:09,010 --> 02:45:10,730
That's why I end up missing you guys.

4587
02:45:10,870 --> 02:45:11,870
Cause you guys are just so fine.

4588
02:45:13,630 --> 02:45:16,830
You guys entertain me more than I entertain you, I feel.

4589
02:45:18,890 --> 02:45:20,810
If you saw Min Kigurumi cosplay.

4590
02:45:21,490 --> 02:45:22,510
That was you!

4591
02:45:22,510 --> 02:45:22,590
Oh!

4592
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:24,310
I did see!

4593
02:45:24,830 --> 02:45:26,330
I did, I did, I did!

4594
02:45:29,230 --> 02:45:30,730
It looked amazing!

4595
02:45:31,950 --> 02:45:33,790
It looked so, so great!

4596
02:45:34,470 --> 02:45:35,510
Thank you!

4597
02:45:37,890 --> 02:45:42,330
I like to say that Oshispar gifted me your standee from Phantom Thief concert of Off-Guy.

4598
02:45:42,410 --> 02:45:45,190
Now she stands in the sun right next to my Femnani stand.

4599
02:45:47,750 --> 02:45:48,810
That's cursed!

4600
02:45:50,830 --> 02:45:53,350
My queen, please let us slurp your brain worm.

4601
02:45:53,610 --> 02:45:55,510
Like one big long spaghetti noodle.

4602
02:45:56,270 --> 02:45:57,090
Mmm, spaghetti.

4603
02:45:58,870 --> 02:46:09,730
Minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky, minky,

4604
02:46:09,730 --> 02:46:09,730
minky, minky, minky, minky.

4605
02:46:10,110 --> 02:46:12,890
Thank you for protecting me from the cotton sickness.

4606
02:46:13,210 --> 02:46:16,190
I had my stop sickness mask all caught.

4607
02:46:16,190 --> 02:46:18,530
Oh, I think I saw you too, phantom.

4608
02:46:23,050 --> 02:46:27,290
I'm convinced that Wisps made up at least half the attendees of Off-Kyle this year.

4609
02:46:27,850 --> 02:46:31,770
From how many mint happies I saw, I wish I could beat up your imposter syndrome.

4610
02:46:32,730 --> 02:46:34,050
Because you are so loud.

4611
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:39,230
Thank you.

4612
02:46:50,720 --> 02:46:55,880
It was a lot of fun to see the happies and stuff, yeah.

4613
02:46:57,660 --> 02:46:59,840
Thank you, everybody, for all the...

4614
02:47:00,840 --> 02:47:03,000
For everybody, for all the...

4615
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,120
Not just the happies too, wearing...

4616
02:47:05,120 --> 02:47:09,060
I saw people wearing shirts and things too, so...

4617
02:47:09,060 --> 02:47:09,660
Thank you.

4618
02:47:10,020 --> 02:47:11,480
You are the source of our happies...

4619
02:47:11,480 --> 02:47:11,680
Stop!

4620
02:47:11,840 --> 02:47:12,480
Don't say that!

4621
02:47:13,860 --> 02:47:14,420
No!

4622
02:47:22,210 --> 02:47:25,450
I'm glad that so many people could wear...

4623
02:47:26,830 --> 02:47:28,850
Mint stuff at Off-Kyle.

4624
02:47:31,470 --> 02:47:33,090
Minto, did you see the artist alley?

4625
02:47:33,230 --> 02:47:34,510
Almost every artist had you.

4626
02:47:49,880 --> 02:47:50,700
Hello, Minky.

4627
02:47:50,840 --> 02:47:51,540
I'm sorry I'm laying.

4628
02:47:51,740 --> 02:47:51,920
No!

4629
02:47:53,660 --> 02:47:54,520
Welcome, welcome.

4630
02:47:57,240 --> 02:47:57,720
Yeah.

4631
02:47:58,340 --> 02:47:58,600
I

4632
02:48:02,560 --> 02:48:03,000
don't know.

4633
02:48:03,300 --> 02:48:03,580
Anyway.

4634
02:48:07,950 --> 02:48:10,130
How many of your mugs do you think you spit on?

4635
02:48:10,230 --> 02:48:11,690
Some people did bring my mug.

4636
02:48:11,850 --> 02:48:12,870
It's such genius.

4637
02:48:13,430 --> 02:48:15,630
You guys are such geniuses.

4638
02:48:17,070 --> 02:48:18,290
I was like, oh my gosh.

4639
02:48:18,510 --> 02:48:20,370
They would like pull out cups and mugs...

4640
02:48:20,370 --> 02:48:21,650
Just for me to spit in.

4641
02:48:22,410 --> 02:48:23,330
And I was like, oh my gosh.

4642
02:48:23,390 --> 02:48:24,230
That's my mug.

4643
02:48:25,570 --> 02:48:26,970
You made my first off-Kyle.

4644
02:48:27,050 --> 02:48:29,050
The best event experience ever get appreciated.

4645
02:48:33,570 --> 02:48:34,970
Don't descend Akasupa.

4646
02:48:35,410 --> 02:48:37,190
Actually, I have your...

4647
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:38,970
Koharu standee right here.

4648
02:48:39,350 --> 02:48:41,530
I was figuring out where to put it in my PC.

4649
02:48:42,150 --> 02:48:43,330
I will take a picture later.

4650
02:48:45,010 --> 02:48:47,170
Dr. Big Saucers.

4651
02:48:47,310 --> 02:48:48,130
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

4652
02:48:48,270 --> 02:48:48,770
Thank you!

4653
02:48:50,850 --> 02:48:51,950
Thank you, thank you.

4654
02:48:53,030 --> 02:48:53,890
I have...

4655
02:48:53,890 --> 02:48:55,270
I have maybe too many.

4656
02:48:55,450 --> 02:49:00,550
I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

4657
02:49:03,390 --> 02:49:05,030
Ten Koharu standees.

4658
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:09,050
I think I have a problem.

4659
02:49:10,490 --> 02:49:13,670
I think I love Koharu too much.

4660
02:49:14,210 --> 02:49:15,410
From Blue Archive.

4661
02:49:15,410 --> 02:49:18,130
I think I...

4662
02:49:20,770 --> 02:49:23,410
I think I really love Koharu.

4663
02:49:24,750 --> 02:49:26,710
Of Blue Archive.

4664
02:49:27,270 --> 02:49:28,610
Shimoe Koharu.

4665
02:49:29,690 --> 02:49:30,770
I

4666
02:49:34,630 --> 02:49:35,770
think I love her too much.

4667
02:49:36,970 --> 02:49:38,110
Hi, Rinto.

4668
02:49:38,290 --> 02:49:38,590
Hello!

4669
02:49:39,790 --> 02:49:41,950
I would've never guessed.

4670
02:49:42,710 --> 02:49:44,030
Rookie numbers.

4671
02:49:45,070 --> 02:49:47,530
I need more.

4672
02:49:51,130 --> 02:49:51,810
I need...

4673
02:49:51,810 --> 02:49:51,930
I need...

4674
02:49:51,930 --> 02:49:52,590
Actually, I don't...

4675
02:49:52,590 --> 02:49:53,230
I have...

4676
02:49:54,210 --> 02:49:54,570
Her...

4677
02:49:55,390 --> 02:49:55,750
Regular...

4678
02:49:55,750 --> 02:49:57,870
Like the official standee of her regular outfit.

4679
02:49:58,050 --> 02:49:59,290
But I don't have the swimsuit outfit.

4680
02:50:00,050 --> 02:50:00,930
I should get that.

4681
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:05,840
She's a dorky.

4682
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:06,520
She's a dorky.

4683
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:06,780
Koharu?

4684
02:50:07,620 --> 02:50:08,680
Yeah, maybe a little.

4685
02:50:09,420 --> 02:50:10,620
She's Moe?

4686
02:50:10,760 --> 02:50:11,700
Yeah, she is.

4687
02:50:14,220 --> 02:50:14,960
I know.

4688
02:50:15,120 --> 02:50:16,620
Her last name is Shimoe.

4689
02:50:17,740 --> 02:50:19,440
Cuz yeah, Shimoe.

4690
02:50:19,780 --> 02:50:21,760
She catched the Blue Archive panel at AX.

4691
02:50:21,900 --> 02:50:23,180
No, I didn't.

4692
02:50:23,840 --> 02:50:25,520
I wasn't streamed or...

4693
02:50:26,640 --> 02:50:27,720
Boss, you outdid this summer.

4694
02:50:27,980 --> 02:50:30,900
I spent two weeks of peak Wisp Maxing.

4695
02:50:31,640 --> 02:50:34,580
Thank you immensely for months of practicing in Japan.

4696
02:50:35,060 --> 02:50:38,880
Mint Kai, Doki Bidet, Fantastic Reality, Virtual Vacation.

4697
02:50:38,980 --> 02:50:42,200
I was only a virtual vacation like two seconds.

4698
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,880
We're insane attending you and Doobie both doing God knows...

4699
02:50:45,880 --> 02:50:47,080
Isn't that so funny?

4700
02:50:48,660 --> 02:50:49,620
But Doobie...

4701
02:50:49,620 --> 02:50:50,560
Doobie...

4702
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:53,220
Not that it's a competition, but Doobie got me beat.

4703
02:50:53,360 --> 02:50:54,640
She's in that sexy...

4704
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:56,220
Sexy bunny girl outfit.

4705
02:50:56,720 --> 02:50:58,180
I want a bunny girl outfit.

4706
02:50:58,920 --> 02:50:59,540
A yummy mouth!

4707
02:51:03,100 --> 02:51:04,220
Outfit after next.

4708
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:05,300
Bunny girl, maybe.

4709
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,460
I found you during a brain warp spiral.

4710
02:51:09,460 --> 02:51:11,060
Oh gosh, that's so embarrassing.

4711
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:12,540
And watching...

4712
02:51:12,540 --> 02:51:15,140
You helped to drown it a lot.

4713
02:51:15,480 --> 02:51:16,900
That's why I'm proud to be a Wisp.

4714
02:51:17,080 --> 02:51:18,080
Thank you for your hard work.

4715
02:51:18,080 --> 02:51:19,120
Thank you.

4716
02:51:20,200 --> 02:51:21,540
Thank you for it.

4717
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:26,140
I will ask Ayamimamo next outfit bunny.

4718
02:51:30,510 --> 02:51:32,690
My next one is being worked on.

4719
02:51:34,990 --> 02:51:35,630
So...

4720
02:51:35,630 --> 02:51:37,170
Hopefully soon-ish.

4721
02:51:37,970 --> 02:51:39,610
I was like, um...

4722
02:51:39,610 --> 02:51:43,030
Doki, why do you get two outfits back to back?

4723
02:51:43,890 --> 02:51:45,190
And, um...

4724
02:51:45,190 --> 02:51:46,790
I've still been waiting on mine.

4725
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:48,190
Excuse me.

4726
02:51:48,750 --> 02:51:49,390
Um...

4727
02:51:49,390 --> 02:51:49,970
We...

4728
02:51:50,770 --> 02:51:51,350
Uh...

4729
02:51:51,350 --> 02:51:52,770
We have the same puffer.

4730
02:51:52,890 --> 02:51:53,770
So please...

4731
02:51:53,770 --> 02:51:54,270
Share.

4732
02:51:56,730 --> 02:51:57,310
Um...

4733
02:51:57,310 --> 02:51:58,550
Mom, why does...

4734
02:51:58,550 --> 02:51:59,790
Doki get two outfits?

4735
02:52:04,570 --> 02:52:05,150
Um...

4736
02:52:05,150 --> 02:52:05,570
Excuse me?

4737
02:52:07,970 --> 02:52:10,770
But I feel bad bugging Ayamimamo.

4738
02:52:11,550 --> 02:52:12,810
Because she's so busy.

4739
02:52:16,130 --> 02:52:20,190
Time to learn from dragoons and bribe Ayamisensei for a minty bunny girl.

4740
02:52:20,830 --> 02:52:22,270
I feel bad though.

4741
02:52:22,690 --> 02:52:23,290
Because it's like...

4742
02:52:24,830 --> 02:52:25,950
You know...

4743
02:52:25,950 --> 02:52:26,410
Yeah.

4744
02:52:26,630 --> 02:52:26,850
Mom!

4745
02:52:27,110 --> 02:52:28,870
Doki is getting another outfit again!

4746
02:52:31,340 --> 02:52:31,900
Mom!

4747
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:32,900
I wanna...

4748
02:52:32,900 --> 02:52:34,280
I wanna wear different clothes!

4749
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:36,580
I've been in the same clothes for three years!

4750
02:52:36,780 --> 02:52:36,960
Please!

4751
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:39,140
Please!

4752
02:52:39,920 --> 02:52:41,160
I want to change!

4753
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:42,840
Why did my tongue come out again?

4754
02:53:08,570 --> 02:53:10,590
I've been told recently...

4755
02:53:11,570 --> 02:53:13,530
That I stick my tongue out a lot.

4756
02:53:15,350 --> 02:53:16,790
I'm glad you can't really tell.

4757
02:53:18,390 --> 02:53:19,510
But what I'm thinking...

4758
02:53:20,590 --> 02:53:21,690
I stick out my tongue.

4759
02:53:22,490 --> 02:53:24,500
If I'm like in conversation with you...

4760
02:53:25,230 --> 02:53:26,310
You'll know I'm listening.

4761
02:53:26,610 --> 02:53:27,730
If I have my tongue...

4762
02:53:27,730 --> 02:53:28,490
I'm like...

4763
02:53:31,930 --> 02:53:33,450
I can't help it though.

4764
02:53:35,310 --> 02:53:36,350
I can't help it.

4765
02:53:36,410 --> 02:53:38,050
It's just a ghostly instinct, you know?

4766
02:53:38,550 --> 02:53:41,530
To be fair, you present unique artistic challenges for Ayamisensei.

4767
02:53:41,630 --> 02:53:42,350
Flatter than...

4768
02:53:42,350 --> 02:53:43,270
That should be...

4769
02:53:43,270 --> 02:53:44,690
That should be better though!

4770
02:53:44,690 --> 02:53:44,770
No!

4771
02:53:45,110 --> 02:53:45,630
Because...

4772
02:53:45,630 --> 02:53:47,970
Because it's less for you to color and draw!

4773
02:53:48,470 --> 02:53:50,110
If there's not as much volume!

4774
02:53:50,950 --> 02:53:52,290
It should be easier!

4775
02:53:55,210 --> 02:53:56,650
Alive or like not enough.

4776
02:54:16,880 --> 02:54:17,900
I can't help it.

4777
02:54:22,020 --> 02:54:23,060
Flatter is justice.

4778
02:54:23,480 --> 02:54:23,760
Yeah!

4779
02:54:25,520 --> 02:54:26,560
I'm expanding!

4780
02:54:26,780 --> 02:54:27,620
Why is my tongue coming?

4781
02:54:27,960 --> 02:54:28,760
I mean...

4782
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:30,600
I'm expanding her...

4783
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:32,340
I'm expanding her...

4784
02:54:32,340 --> 02:54:32,980
Her...

4785
02:54:32,980 --> 02:54:33,920
Her post...

4786
02:54:33,920 --> 02:54:35,020
Artistic portfolio.

4787
02:54:36,530 --> 02:54:38,720
I'm expanding her artistic portfolio!

4788
02:54:43,050 --> 02:54:43,760
I am!

4789
02:54:44,390 --> 02:54:45,160
I'm helping!

4790
02:54:46,600 --> 02:54:47,100
Oh!

4791
02:54:47,260 --> 02:54:47,580
Sorry.

4792
02:54:47,880 --> 02:54:49,040
I just punched my mic.

4793
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:52,460
I'm going to change my ocean mark!

4794
02:54:52,460 --> 02:54:53,980
New minto ocean marks!

4795
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:54,540
I'm not...

4796
02:54:54,540 --> 02:54:57,340
I actually have considered changing my ocean mark a little bit.

4797
02:54:59,080 --> 02:55:00,100
Because right now...

4798
02:55:00,100 --> 02:55:00,920
But I was like...

4799
02:55:00,920 --> 02:55:01,120
Made!

4800
02:55:01,340 --> 02:55:03,260
Moe magic is like sparkly, so...

4801
02:55:04,500 --> 02:55:08,200
I have been doing the mint model in MGSV mod and it has been a nightmare.

4802
02:55:08,780 --> 02:55:11,280
Who would have guessed that the fox engine would be so...

4803
02:55:11,280 --> 02:55:12,700
God damn hard to modify.

4804
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:13,440
What?

4805
02:55:20,700 --> 02:55:22,340
Hide your tongue in my mouth.

4806
02:55:22,560 --> 02:55:23,780
Barry, shut up!

4807
02:55:24,920 --> 02:55:28,120
Someone get this girl some pockets to lick.

4808
02:55:28,280 --> 02:55:28,540
Stay!

4809
02:55:30,240 --> 02:55:31,760
I need to play a blue wind!

4810
02:55:32,380 --> 02:55:34,000
See more things in the bar game day!

4811
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:40,220
Did you lick...

4812
02:55:42,040 --> 02:55:44,300
Do you lick switch cartridges?

4813
02:55:44,600 --> 02:55:45,360
I have before.

4814
02:55:46,040 --> 02:55:48,440
Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky!

4815
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:50,500
Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky, Minky...

4816
02:55:50,500 --> 02:55:53,180
I promised Akka if Barry sent that message.

4817
02:55:54,180 --> 02:55:55,520
Asa, can I get a blip?

4818
02:56:08,530 --> 02:56:11,070
Why are you... Stop bullying Barriebug.

4819
02:56:12,810 --> 02:56:14,850
Man, there's a creep in the chat.

4820
02:56:15,310 --> 02:56:16,010
Barriebug.

4821
02:56:17,170 --> 02:56:18,570
Van Barriebug.

4822
02:56:21,350 --> 02:56:26,290
Gosh, a literal power trip gets a wrench and starts going crazy.

4823
02:56:29,170 --> 02:56:30,650
Mod power trip.

4824
02:56:31,470 --> 02:56:34,490
Maybe this is why I never gave him wrenches before.

4825
02:56:37,010 --> 02:56:38,370
Maybe this is why.

4826
02:56:40,090 --> 02:56:41,190
Thank you, Ducky.

4827
02:56:41,370 --> 02:56:42,650
I hope you like the blip.

4828
02:56:50,340 --> 02:56:52,520
The power is taking over me.

4829
02:56:52,860 --> 02:56:54,200
It's like the mask.

4830
02:56:54,680 --> 02:56:56,340
It's like the...

4831
02:56:56,980 --> 02:56:58,900
The mask Jim Carrey.

4832
02:57:01,280 --> 02:57:02,740
It's like the venom suit.

4833
02:57:06,740 --> 02:57:07,940
Mito is home.

4834
02:57:08,080 --> 02:57:08,820
Mito is home.

4835
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:09,800
Mito is home.

4836
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:10,540
Mito is...

4837
02:57:10,540 --> 02:57:10,800
It is!

4838
02:57:15,730 --> 02:57:16,240
What?

4839
02:57:17,790 --> 02:57:19,000
Finish your sentence.

4840
02:57:19,420 --> 02:57:20,040
Fail.

4841
02:57:23,500 --> 02:57:25,100
Mito is what?

4842
02:57:37,530 --> 02:57:39,210
Huey Emmerich.

4843
02:57:39,590 --> 02:57:39,830
No!

4844
02:57:42,310 --> 02:57:44,950
Guys, you think I could finish...

4845
02:57:44,950 --> 02:57:46,870
V before Delta?

4846
02:57:47,810 --> 02:57:49,450
If I did mods...

4847
02:57:49,450 --> 02:57:52,130
The only mod that I can think of doing...

4848
02:57:52,130 --> 02:57:54,390
For V is...

4849
02:57:54,390 --> 02:57:56,230
Getting rid of R&D time.

4850
02:58:02,410 --> 02:58:05,150
I thought about doing the one where...

4851
02:58:05,150 --> 02:58:07,230
The mod where all soldiers are S rank.

4852
02:58:07,390 --> 02:58:08,170
But then I was like...

4853
02:58:10,110 --> 02:58:11,170
I was like...

4854
02:58:12,230 --> 02:58:14,510
I think people will be too mad at me.

4855
02:58:14,610 --> 02:58:16,370
They'll be like, what's the point of you even playing?

4856
02:58:16,370 --> 02:58:18,190
If you're cheating.

4857
02:58:18,650 --> 02:58:20,250
If they're all S rank.

4858
02:58:20,890 --> 02:58:21,950
She's so back.

4859
02:58:22,350 --> 02:58:23,310
We are so back.

4860
02:58:26,350 --> 02:58:28,330
Story missions only or everything?

4861
02:58:28,570 --> 02:58:29,050
I don't know.

4862
02:58:30,730 --> 02:58:32,110
Finish the series.

4863
02:58:32,110 --> 02:58:33,450
I've beaten it.

4864
02:58:33,450 --> 02:58:34,470
I've beaten it before.

4865
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:36,170
But just to finish...

4866
02:58:36,170 --> 02:58:37,350
For my channel, you know.

4867
02:58:39,270 --> 02:58:39,710
Hmm...

4868
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:42,170
I'm trying to decide when to start it.

4869
02:58:42,290 --> 02:58:43,770
That's why I haven't put out my schedule yet.

4870
02:58:43,830 --> 02:58:44,910
Because I was like...

4871
02:58:44,910 --> 02:58:46,450
Do I...

4872
02:58:47,390 --> 02:58:48,970
Do I start it this week?

4873
02:58:49,070 --> 02:58:50,230
But then I'm like...

4874
02:58:50,230 --> 02:58:53,130
Well, I probably won't finish before...

4875
02:58:54,490 --> 02:58:54,930
Before...

4876
02:58:54,930 --> 02:58:55,990
Not MGSCon.

4877
02:58:56,050 --> 02:58:57,090
Before Delta.

4878
02:58:58,650 --> 02:58:59,070
I

4879
02:59:06,870 --> 02:59:07,130
don't know.

4880
02:59:08,610 --> 02:59:09,630
Now that you're back.

4881
02:59:09,910 --> 02:59:11,770
When can we expect the next ASMR?

4882
02:59:13,470 --> 02:59:14,550
I don't know.

4883
02:59:15,110 --> 02:59:16,690
Do you want another ASMR?

4884
02:59:18,330 --> 02:59:19,710
I would have to...

4885
02:59:19,710 --> 02:59:20,390
Practice.

4886
02:59:21,310 --> 02:59:22,750
Any plans for Death Stranding 2?

4887
02:59:23,110 --> 02:59:24,070
I want...

4888
02:59:24,070 --> 02:59:25,830
I need to finish Death Stranding 1 first.

4889
02:59:27,050 --> 02:59:27,910
My whole...

4890
02:59:27,910 --> 02:59:30,330
My throat going bad...

4891
02:59:30,330 --> 02:59:32,210
Kind of ruined my whole...

4892
02:59:32,210 --> 02:59:34,230
Play Death Stranding...

4893
02:59:34,230 --> 02:59:35,610
And get through it...

4894
02:59:35,610 --> 02:59:37,210
To play then Death Stranding 2...

4895
02:59:37,550 --> 02:59:38,190
By...

4896
02:59:38,190 --> 02:59:39,410
Release...

4897
02:59:40,970 --> 02:59:43,570
Completely threw a wrench in my plans...

4898
02:59:46,230 --> 02:59:46,730
Unfortunately...

4899
02:59:49,650 --> 02:59:52,650
Have you seen your last ASMR video numbers?

4900
02:59:53,310 --> 02:59:54,650
No, I don't look at that.

4901
02:59:54,970 --> 02:59:55,390
Hold on.

4902
02:59:57,990 --> 02:59:59,030
What is it?

4903
03:00:01,270 --> 03:00:01,850
Jesse!

4904
03:00:02,290 --> 03:00:02,950
Thank you for the back...

4905
03:00:02,950 --> 03:00:03,750
Thank you!

4906
03:00:08,070 --> 03:00:08,650
ASMR...

4907
03:00:08,650 --> 03:00:08,810
Which?

4908
03:00:09,030 --> 03:00:09,150
Which?

4909
03:00:09,450 --> 03:00:09,610
Which?

4910
03:00:10,270 --> 03:00:10,830
Which?

4911
03:00:11,110 --> 03:00:11,690
Which?

4912
03:00:12,170 --> 03:00:12,390
Which?

4913
03:00:12,390 --> 03:00:12,910
ASMR?

4914
03:00:15,890 --> 03:00:16,470
Oh...

4915
03:00:17,270 --> 03:00:17,850
Oh...

4916
03:00:17,850 --> 03:00:19,290
Oh my gosh, it's so funny...

4917
03:00:19,290 --> 03:00:20,230
I just had a...

4918
03:00:20,230 --> 03:00:22,750
I'm back stream on June 5th...

4919
03:00:22,750 --> 03:00:23,750
I'm the worst...

4920
03:00:23,750 --> 03:00:24,630
I'm sorry guys...

4921
03:00:24,630 --> 03:00:25,890
I've been traveling so much...

4922
03:00:27,370 --> 03:00:28,710
Your ASMR was the first...

4923
03:00:28,710 --> 03:00:30,650
That didn't make me barfy...

4924
03:00:30,650 --> 03:00:31,490
Oh...

4925
03:00:31,490 --> 03:00:32,730
That's kind of...

4926
03:00:33,470 --> 03:00:34,030
ASMR...

4927
03:00:34,030 --> 03:00:35,510
The positive affirmations...

4928
03:00:35,510 --> 03:00:36,290
Question mark one?

4929
03:00:36,890 --> 03:00:38,850
It's kind of a high number...

4930
03:00:48,070 --> 03:00:49,670
You've been doing so much...

4931
03:00:50,490 --> 03:00:52,010
Yeah, luckily...

4932
03:00:52,010 --> 03:00:53,070
From...

4933
03:00:53,070 --> 03:00:53,870
For now...

4934
03:00:55,150 --> 03:00:55,750
Uh...

4935
03:00:55,750 --> 03:00:57,430
I will be much, much...

4936
03:00:57,430 --> 03:00:58,790
Much, much, much...

4937
03:01:00,830 --> 03:01:01,430
Um...

4938
03:01:01,430 --> 03:01:02,210
Uh...

4939
03:01:02,210 --> 03:01:03,370
Calm down...

4940
03:01:03,970 --> 03:01:07,190
For a while, I think, so...

4941
03:01:07,190 --> 03:01:08,030
Yeah...

4942
03:01:08,030 --> 03:01:08,990
Yeah, yeah...

4943
03:01:08,990 --> 03:01:11,330
At least I don't have anything planned...

4944
03:01:11,330 --> 03:01:12,230
We'll see if things...

4945
03:01:12,230 --> 03:01:12,630
I'm...

4946
03:01:12,630 --> 03:01:13,550
I'm scared...

4947
03:01:13,550 --> 03:01:15,230
What if they announce a Metal Gear Cafe?

4948
03:01:16,110 --> 03:01:18,350
Like a collab cafe...

4949
03:01:18,350 --> 03:01:20,370
Would you guys be mad if I went to Japan...

4950
03:01:20,370 --> 03:01:21,290
For like...

4951
03:01:21,290 --> 03:01:22,150
Two days...

4952
03:01:22,150 --> 03:01:22,970
Just for the cafe...

4953
03:01:22,970 --> 03:01:23,990
And then came home...

4954
03:01:25,450 --> 03:01:29,410
I don't welcome the membership...

4955
03:01:29,410 --> 03:01:30,010
Thank you...

4956
03:01:30,010 --> 03:01:31,630
ASMR with a hand cam...

4957
03:01:31,630 --> 03:01:32,590
But it's just a bottle...

4958
03:01:32,590 --> 03:01:34,930
And spit drips down sometimes...

4959
03:01:36,310 --> 03:01:38,890
Stream ends when it's full...

4960
03:01:39,510 --> 03:01:40,070
Fine...

4961
03:01:40,070 --> 03:01:41,050
Um...

4962
03:01:41,050 --> 03:01:43,710
You can still delete that...

4963
03:01:46,210 --> 03:01:47,830
MGS Con and Delta release...

4964
03:01:47,830 --> 03:01:49,050
Are five days apart...

4965
03:01:49,050 --> 03:01:50,490
MGS V, please...

4966
03:01:53,790 --> 03:01:55,710
I'd be mad if you didn't go...

4967
03:01:56,310 --> 03:01:57,290
Just vlog it...

4968
03:01:57,290 --> 03:01:57,710
I would...

4969
03:02:00,110 --> 03:02:02,030
I would show you guys everything...

4970
03:02:02,030 --> 03:02:03,990
I would actually not show you everything...

4971
03:02:03,990 --> 03:02:06,150
Because there would be tears in my food...

4972
03:02:08,790 --> 03:02:09,590
I got...

4973
03:02:09,590 --> 03:02:10,270
I got nervous...

4974
03:02:10,690 --> 03:02:11,430
Because I was just like...

4975
03:02:11,430 --> 03:02:13,570
They probably won't do one...

4976
03:02:13,570 --> 03:02:15,130
And then...

4977
03:02:15,130 --> 03:02:16,470
Because I was just like...

4978
03:02:16,470 --> 03:02:17,870
Oh, they would have to have already...

4979
03:02:17,870 --> 03:02:19,170
It would...

4980
03:02:19,170 --> 03:02:20,310
Probably be...

4981
03:02:20,310 --> 03:02:22,390
It would probably be...

4982
03:02:22,910 --> 03:02:23,430
Now...

4983
03:02:23,430 --> 03:02:25,030
That they do the cafe, right?

4984
03:02:26,830 --> 03:02:27,750
But then...

4985
03:02:27,750 --> 03:02:29,230
Then I was just like...

4986
03:02:29,230 --> 03:02:30,620
Wait, but the Death Stranding Cafe...

4987
03:02:32,170 --> 03:02:32,630
Happened...

4988
03:02:32,630 --> 03:02:34,550
When it got released...

4989
03:02:37,830 --> 03:02:38,290
So...

4990
03:02:42,470 --> 03:02:44,230
What if they release Delta...

4991
03:02:44,230 --> 03:02:46,450
And then they do a collab cafe...

4992
03:02:46,450 --> 03:02:48,350
I would have to go...

4993
03:02:48,350 --> 03:02:49,590
You know...

4994
03:02:49,590 --> 03:02:51,390
It scares me...

4995
03:02:51,390 --> 03:02:52,510
I don't want to go...

4996
03:02:52,510 --> 03:02:54,330
My wallet...

4997
03:02:54,330 --> 03:02:55,730
I don't...

4998
03:02:56,370 --> 03:02:57,750
I would only be mad...

4999
03:02:57,750 --> 03:02:59,410
If you were mean to yourself...

5000
03:03:03,850 --> 03:03:04,350
So...

5001
03:03:04,350 --> 03:03:04,610
I'm...

5002
03:03:04,610 --> 03:03:04,950
I'm...

5003
03:03:04,950 --> 03:03:07,230
I'm hoping that they don't...

5004
03:03:07,230 --> 03:03:09,770
I'm hoping that they don't do one...

5005
03:03:10,610 --> 03:03:12,770
But I'm also scared...

5006
03:03:16,150 --> 03:03:17,270
I'm scared...

5007
03:03:19,410 --> 03:03:21,170
I'm scared...

5008
03:03:21,170 --> 03:03:21,510
I'm scared...

5009
03:03:21,510 --> 03:03:23,410
If Death Stranding had alligator...

5010
03:03:23,410 --> 03:03:25,030
Will MGS have snake...

5011
03:03:25,810 --> 03:03:27,570
What kind of menu would it be?

5012
03:03:32,750 --> 03:03:34,590
I want to eat whatever...

5013
03:03:34,590 --> 03:03:35,770
Vulgan's cooking...

5014
03:03:38,030 --> 03:03:39,030
Oh my gosh...

5015
03:03:39,610 --> 03:03:40,270
Oh my gosh...

5016
03:03:40,270 --> 03:03:41,030
Imagine this...

5017
03:03:41,750 --> 03:03:42,730
Okay, Konami...

5018
03:03:42,730 --> 03:03:43,210
If you're listening...

5019
03:03:43,550 --> 03:03:44,690
Here's an idea...

5020
03:03:46,610 --> 03:03:48,910
Plate of rice...

5021
03:03:48,910 --> 03:03:49,610
Plate of rice...

5022
03:03:49,610 --> 03:03:51,150
And then...

5023
03:03:51,150 --> 03:03:53,030
Rykov's thong...

5024
03:03:56,750 --> 03:03:59,010
On top of the rice...

5025
03:03:59,010 --> 03:04:02,960
Hypothetical MGS collab cafe...

5026
03:04:03,170 --> 03:04:06,100
Thank you, Miskin said it...

5027
03:04:12,370 --> 03:04:14,440
Rykov's thong...

5028
03:04:14,440 --> 03:04:17,000
On top of the rice...

5029
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:18,660
On top of the rice...

5030
03:04:18,660 --> 03:04:20,840
With the Thunderbolt logo...

5031
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:23,560
Onigiri...

5032
03:04:23,560 --> 03:04:25,340
But the seaweed is thong-shaped...

5033
03:04:26,440 --> 03:04:26,900
Exactly...

5034
03:04:29,840 --> 03:04:31,340
Oh my gosh...

5035
03:04:31,340 --> 03:04:31,980
And then...

5036
03:04:31,980 --> 03:04:32,680
You have...

5037
03:04:33,600 --> 03:04:34,960
You have...

5038
03:04:35,200 --> 03:04:36,120
You have...

5039
03:04:36,120 --> 03:04:37,460
A plate that's called...

5040
03:04:37,460 --> 03:04:37,840
You...

5041
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:38,760
This or some...

5042
03:04:38,760 --> 03:04:39,680
You...

5043
03:04:39,680 --> 03:04:40,960
If you eat this...

5044
03:04:40,960 --> 03:04:42,440
You taste like...

5045
03:04:42,440 --> 03:04:44,480
A wild beast...

5046
03:04:45,740 --> 03:04:46,840
Or...

5047
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:48,100
Or...

5048
03:04:48,600 --> 03:04:49,600
Okay...

5049
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:50,820
It's in...

5050
03:04:50,820 --> 03:04:52,780
It's...

5051
03:04:52,780 --> 03:04:53,700
It's in...

5052
03:04:53,700 --> 03:04:54,340
Workshop...

5053
03:04:54,340 --> 03:04:54,890
Workshop...

5054
03:04:56,180 --> 03:04:57,940
Gotta have calorie, mate...

5055
03:04:57,940 --> 03:04:58,780
Oh, 100%!

5056
03:05:02,500 --> 03:05:04,150
The pain...

5057
03:05:04,150 --> 03:05:05,270
Bowl of life...

5058
03:05:06,310 --> 03:05:06,830
Bees...

5059
03:05:13,680 --> 03:05:14,620
Wrong game...

5060
03:05:14,620 --> 03:05:15,740
But I would love to eat...

5061
03:05:16,260 --> 03:05:16,780
Gunpowder...

5062
03:05:16,780 --> 03:05:17,780
I think it just...

5063
03:05:17,780 --> 03:05:18,780
I think gunpowder...

5064
03:05:18,780 --> 03:05:20,060
Would probably just be like...

5065
03:05:20,060 --> 03:05:21,380
A Pop Rocks...

5066
03:05:22,760 --> 03:05:23,520
You chew it...

5067
03:05:23,520 --> 03:05:24,640
And it's...

5068
03:05:25,740 --> 03:05:26,980
In your mouth...

5069
03:05:29,380 --> 03:05:31,000
Yeah, I think it'd be fine...

5070
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:32,800
Roasted the N's parakeet...

5071
03:05:32,800 --> 03:05:33,160
No!

5072
03:05:35,000 --> 03:05:37,380
More money for theoretical cafe trip...

5073
03:05:37,380 --> 03:05:37,580
No!

5074
03:05:38,620 --> 03:05:39,500
Thank you...

5075
03:05:42,040 --> 03:05:42,920
Thank you...

5076
03:05:44,870 --> 03:05:46,370
Just put actual gunpowder...

5077
03:05:46,370 --> 03:05:46,890
It'll be fine...

5078
03:05:46,890 --> 03:05:47,370
Yeah, I mean...

5079
03:05:47,370 --> 03:05:48,390
I say that...

5080
03:05:48,390 --> 03:05:49,550
And I think it would just be like...

5081
03:05:49,550 --> 03:05:50,230
A Pop Rocks...

5082
03:05:50,830 --> 03:05:52,350
And it just pop in your mouth...

5083
03:05:52,350 --> 03:05:53,230
When you chew on it...

5084
03:05:59,760 --> 03:06:01,760
This Wisps gotta head to bed...

5085
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:03,000
But wanted to say...

5086
03:06:03,000 --> 03:06:04,140
That I'm super duper happy...

5087
03:06:04,140 --> 03:06:04,820
And proud of you...

5088
03:06:04,820 --> 03:06:05,720
For all the cool things...

5089
03:06:05,720 --> 03:06:06,300
You've done...

5090
03:06:06,300 --> 03:06:07,800
And experienced recently...

5091
03:06:07,800 --> 03:06:08,920
With all our...

5092
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:09,700
Meet the love...

5093
03:06:09,700 --> 03:06:10,280

5094
03:06:10,860 --> 03:06:11,660
Oh yes, and me!

5095
03:06:13,620 --> 03:06:15,320
Wait, did I welcome you guys...

5096
03:06:15,320 --> 03:06:16,120
Back to the main cafe?

5097
03:06:16,840 --> 03:06:18,360
Oh yes, I did...

5098
03:06:18,360 --> 03:06:20,060
I remember cyanide...

5099
03:06:20,860 --> 03:06:21,380
This...

5100
03:06:21,380 --> 03:06:22,860
The beginning of the stream...

5101
03:06:22,860 --> 03:06:23,340
Yeah...

5102
03:06:23,340 --> 03:06:24,060
I remember...

5103
03:06:28,310 --> 03:06:28,830
Yeah...

5104
03:06:30,110 --> 03:06:31,470
What if I didn't...

5105
03:06:31,470 --> 03:06:32,550
And you guys were just standing...

5106
03:06:32,550 --> 03:06:33,490
At the doorway...

5107
03:06:33,490 --> 03:06:35,930
The whole time...

5108
03:06:37,310 --> 03:06:39,130
That would be so silly...

5109
03:06:39,130 --> 03:06:40,610
Mushroom stew that recharges...

5110
03:06:40,610 --> 03:06:41,890
Your phone's battery...

5111
03:06:42,870 --> 03:06:44,150
Wait, they could actually...

5112
03:06:44,150 --> 03:06:45,070
Do mushroom stew though...

5113
03:06:45,070 --> 03:06:45,450
The thing...

5114
03:06:45,450 --> 03:06:46,330
The great thing about...

5115
03:06:46,330 --> 03:06:47,330
About three...

5116
03:06:47,330 --> 03:06:49,350
Is it's all food based...

5117
03:06:50,830 --> 03:06:52,050
Oh my gosh...

5118
03:06:52,050 --> 03:06:53,090
And then you do like...

5119
03:06:53,090 --> 03:06:55,030
A Russian roulette style food...

5120
03:06:55,030 --> 03:06:55,970
Where like...

5121
03:06:55,970 --> 03:06:57,370
One of them tastes good...

5122
03:06:57,370 --> 03:06:57,990
And one of them...

5123
03:06:57,990 --> 03:07:00,030
Tastes really gross...

5124
03:07:00,030 --> 03:07:00,910
And you're like...

5125
03:07:00,910 --> 03:07:02,810
That's disgusting...

5126
03:07:02,810 --> 03:07:04,290
You know, like that...

5127
03:07:06,910 --> 03:07:07,890
And then...

5128
03:07:07,890 --> 03:07:09,050
When you taste the good one...

5129
03:07:09,050 --> 03:07:09,330
You're like...

5130
03:07:09,330 --> 03:07:10,150
I want some more!

5131
03:07:13,450 --> 03:07:14,450
Yeah, yeah...

5132
03:07:14,450 --> 03:07:14,990
Like that...

5133
03:07:16,750 --> 03:07:17,270
T...

5134
03:07:18,250 --> 03:07:20,110
You can leave your...

5135
03:07:20,110 --> 03:07:21,410
Review as a codec call...

5136
03:07:21,410 --> 03:07:21,690

5137
03:07:27,370 --> 03:07:27,930

Exactly...

5142
03:07:31,790 --> 03:07:32,710
I brought my...

5143
03:07:32,710 --> 03:07:33,530
Minto kitchen...

5144
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:34,850
Scuba diving today...

5145
03:07:34,850 --> 03:07:36,410
Did she drown?

5146
03:07:38,870 --> 03:07:39,630
Whoa...

5147
03:07:42,660 --> 03:07:44,980
This is some good brainstorming...

5148
03:07:44,980 --> 03:07:45,680
I agree...

5149
03:07:46,600 --> 03:07:47,680
I agree...

5150
03:07:48,420 --> 03:07:48,960
Oh...

5151
03:07:48,960 --> 03:07:50,500

03:08:38,990 --> 03:08:39,770
I was just saying...

5178
03:08:39,770 --> 03:08:41,410
I was leaving...

5179
03:08:41,410 --> 03:08:42,530
Oh no...

5213
03:09:38,190 --> 03:09:38,450
Wait.

5214
03:09:40,790 --> 03:09:41,310
Nimmie!

5215
03:09:41,570 --> 03:09:41,890
No pressure.

5216
03:09:42,110 --> 03:09:43,610
You did so good with everything this weekend.

5217
03:09:44,530 --> 03:09:45,050
Nimmie.

5218
03:09:46,250 --> 03:09:46,770
Idol.

5219
03:09:51,370 --> 03:09:53,810
Idol outfit was so beautiful.

5220
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:55,050
You were so beautiful.

5221
03:09:55,630 --> 03:09:57,210
Love me, love me.

5222
03:09:57,450 --> 03:09:59,050
Say that you love me.

5223
03:09:59,050 --> 03:10:01,830
That is a Nimmie nightmare song now.

5224
03:10:01,830 --> 03:10:02,630
It's my favorite.

5225
03:10:02,790 --> 03:10:04,990
I've come to love that song so much because of you.

5226
03:10:09,710 --> 03:10:11,450
Thank you, Nimmie.

5227
03:10:12,490 --> 03:10:14,790
I can't wait for our collab later this week.

5228
03:10:15,010 --> 03:10:20,410
Later this week, me, Doki, Doobie, Nimmie will be collabing.

5229
03:10:20,570 --> 03:10:21,650
What's that game called?

5230
03:10:21,810 --> 03:10:22,790
Emissary Zero?

5231
03:10:24,730 --> 03:10:25,370
So.

5232
03:10:26,430 --> 03:10:27,490
I'm excited.

5233
03:10:31,890 --> 03:10:33,430
It's her signature song.

5234
03:10:33,590 --> 03:10:34,350
It is.

5235
03:10:34,990 --> 03:10:36,350

I know.

5237
03:10:37,670 --> 03:10:39,450
I love Nimmie karaoke so much.

5238
03:10:44,330 --> 03:10:44,850
So.

5239
03:10:45,130 --> 03:10:46,890
Amazing job at virtual vacation.

5240
03:10:47,390 --> 03:10:48,170
If you're still here.

5241
03:10:50,430 --> 03:10:50,950
Oh.

5242
03:10:51,170 --> 03:10:51,650
Oh yeah.

5243
03:10:54,540 --> 03:10:56,100
Thank you guys for all the gifted.

5244
03:10:56,320 --> 03:10:56,900
Thank you, Nimmie.

5245
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:58,500
Let's see if we can rate somebody.

5246
03:10:59,480 --> 03:11:00,200
If we can.

5247
03:11:02,080 --> 03:11:02,700
Let's see.

5248
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:11,260
Let's see if who's able to be rated.

5249
03:11:16,210 --> 03:11:16,630
Wait.

5250
03:11:16,790 --> 03:11:16,830
Oh.

5251
03:11:17,190 --> 03:11:17,290
Uh.

5252
03:11:17,490 --> 03:11:17,610
Wait.

5253
03:11:17,790 --> 03:11:18,970
How do I do the rate again?

5254
03:11:19,370 --> 03:11:19,650
Uh.

5255
03:11:19,910 --> 03:11:20,050
Wait.

5256
03:11:21,430 --> 03:11:21,850
Ah.

5257
03:11:21,850 --> 03:11:22,270
Dwargo!

5258
03:11:23,210 --> 03:11:23,990
Thank you!

5259
03:11:25,230 --> 03:11:27,830
Thank you for all your donuts.

5260
03:11:28,310 --> 03:11:28,710
Thank you.

5261
03:11:28,850 --> 03:11:29,450
Thank you guys.

5262
03:11:29,550 --> 03:11:30,390
Thank you for all the gifted.

5263
03:11:30,970 --> 03:11:31,410
Thank you.

5264
03:11:31,510 --> 03:11:31,890
Thank you.

5265
03:11:32,370 --> 03:11:32,610
Oh.

5266
03:11:32,710 --> 03:11:32,970
Redirect.

5267
03:11:33,150 --> 03:11:33,370
Here we go.

5268
03:11:33,950 --> 03:11:34,510
Um.

5269
03:11:38,030 --> 03:11:38,530
Uh.

5270
03:11:39,430 --> 03:11:41,330
It doesn't show me anybody's streaming.

5271
03:11:44,010 --> 03:11:45,230
Everything says upcoming.

5272
03:11:50,690 --> 03:11:51,250
Biju.

5273
03:11:51,570 --> 03:11:53,710
I don't think she has a rating on.

5274
03:11:53,930 --> 03:11:55,090
Because she doesn't show up.

5275
03:11:55,790 --> 03:11:56,610
Or my...

5276
03:11:58,050 --> 03:12:00,950
I don't think she has it where you can rate her.

5277
03:12:01,210 --> 03:12:02,470
You have to turn it on, you know.

5278
03:12:05,250 --> 03:12:05,810
Yeah.

5279
03:12:06,630 --> 03:12:07,070
So.

5280
03:12:08,030 --> 03:12:08,970
That's okay.

5281
03:12:10,050 --> 03:12:10,630
Um.

5282
03:12:11,390 --> 03:12:12,490
I will just, uh.

5283
03:12:13,530 --> 03:12:15,130
Let you guys be free.

5284
03:12:15,450 --> 03:12:17,890
And you can find somewhere else to hang out.

5285
03:12:18,270 --> 03:12:18,630
I guess.

5286
03:12:20,310 --> 03:12:20,890
Oh.

5287
03:12:21,590 --> 03:12:21,910
Yeah.

5288
03:12:23,310 --> 03:12:24,390
Thank you guys.

5289
03:12:24,850 --> 03:12:25,110
Thank you.

5290
03:12:25,230 --> 03:12:25,590
Thank you.

5291
03:12:25,870 --> 03:12:27,030
I hope you guys had a...

5292
03:12:27,030 --> 03:12:28,870
Have a wonderful day.

5293
03:12:28,990 --> 03:12:29,750
Have a wonderful night.

5294
03:12:31,490 --> 03:12:32,010
Um.

5295
03:12:32,690 --> 03:12:33,730
And, uh.

5296
03:12:34,670 --> 03:12:35,190
Uh.

5297
03:12:35,350 --> 03:12:36,310
I really appreciate the...

5298
03:12:37,190 --> 03:12:37,630
Um.

5299
03:12:38,550 --> 03:12:39,970
The warm welcome back.

5300
03:12:40,710 --> 03:12:40,930
Uh.

5301
03:12:41,070 --> 03:12:41,850
Just to let you guys...

5302
03:12:41,850 --> 03:12:42,790
For the raids, you guys.

5303
03:12:42,930 --> 03:12:44,310
I know there are certain people streaming.

5304
03:12:44,790 --> 03:12:45,310
They...

5305
03:12:45,970 --> 03:12:47,010
I cannot...

5306
03:12:47,010 --> 03:12:48,130
So, you...

5307
03:12:48,130 --> 03:12:48,670
For...

5308
03:12:48,670 --> 03:12:49,230
For...

5309
03:12:49,230 --> 03:12:50,750
For redirecting.

5310
03:12:50,910 --> 03:12:51,370
For raiding.

5311
03:12:51,750 --> 03:12:52,150
Um.

5312
03:12:52,350 --> 03:12:53,570
You have to turn it on.

5313
03:12:53,730 --> 03:12:55,430
And, like, you have to make it so either...

5314
03:12:55,430 --> 03:12:56,910
Everybody can raid you.

5315
03:12:57,390 --> 03:12:57,830
Or...

5316
03:12:57,830 --> 03:12:59,810
Only certain people can raid you.

5317
03:12:59,930 --> 03:13:02,570
And if I'm not on the list, I cannot raid people.

5318
03:13:02,810 --> 03:13:03,150
So...

5319
03:13:03,150 --> 03:13:04,510
That's why if you're just like...

5320
03:13:04,510 --> 03:13:05,550
You can raid this person.

5321
03:13:05,550 --> 03:13:06,530
They're streaming right now.

5322
03:13:06,530 --> 03:13:08,730
I cannot because...

5323
03:13:09,330 --> 03:13:10,250
They are...

5324
03:13:10,250 --> 03:13:11,550
I'm not on the list.

5325
03:13:11,790 --> 03:13:12,370
Which is okay.

5326
03:13:13,870 --> 03:13:14,390
Yeah.

5327
03:13:14,810 --> 03:13:16,050
So, that's how it works.

5328
03:13:17,250 --> 03:13:18,010
Yeah, yeah.

5329
03:13:18,370 --> 03:13:21,090
So, it's not that I'm ignoring you guys telling me.

5330
03:13:22,490 --> 03:13:23,730
I'm just letting you know.

5331
03:13:23,870 --> 03:13:24,030
That's...

5332
03:13:24,030 --> 03:13:25,470
That's how it works for everybody.

5333
03:13:26,130 --> 03:13:26,650
So...

5334
03:13:26,650 --> 03:13:27,350
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5335
03:13:30,190 --> 03:13:30,710
Anyway.

5336
03:13:34,440 --> 03:13:35,820
Kicking you guys out.

5337
03:13:35,920 --> 03:13:36,560
Yeah, yeah.

5338
03:13:36,860 --> 03:13:38,840
The maid cafe is closed.

5339
03:13:42,300 --> 03:13:42,620
Otumito!

5340
03:13:43,180 --> 03:13:44,120
Thank you guys!

5341
03:13:44,760 --> 03:13:45,420
Thank you, thank you.

5342
03:13:45,480 --> 03:13:46,580
I will have my schedule out.

5343
03:13:47,560 --> 03:13:47,880
Tonight?

5344
03:13:48,080 --> 03:13:48,320
Tomorrow?

5345
03:13:48,720 --> 03:13:49,820
I have to figure stuff out.

5346
03:13:50,120 --> 03:13:51,140
I'm still jet lagged.

5347
03:13:51,440 --> 03:13:52,580
I don't think I'll stream tomorrow.

5348
03:13:54,160 --> 03:13:54,480
But...

5349
03:13:55,660 --> 03:13:55,980
Otumito!

5350
03:13:56,040 --> 03:13:56,960
Thank you guys for all the gifted.

5351
03:13:57,100 --> 03:13:57,980
Thank you for all the super chants.

5352
03:13:58,220 --> 03:13:59,840
I really, really appreciate it.

5353
03:14:00,120 --> 03:14:00,820
Thank you so much.

5354
03:14:00,920 --> 03:14:01,960
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

5355
03:14:05,730 --> 03:14:06,050
Otumito!

5356
03:14:06,250 --> 03:14:07,330
Itte lashoi!

5357
03:14:07,330 --> 03:14:08,170
Have a good day, have a good night.

5358
03:14:08,250 --> 03:14:09,110
And I'll see you guys...

5359
03:14:09,110 --> 03:14:10,270
When I see you next!

5360
03:14:11,050 --> 03:14:11,630
Bye bye!

5361
03:14:12,270 --> 03:14:12,710
Bye bye!

5362
03:14:12,930 --> 03:14:13,270
Bye bye!

5363
03:14:13,710 --> 03:14:14,390
Bye bye!

5364
03:14:14,930 --> 03:14:15,930
Bye bye bye bye!

5365
03:14:28,510 --> 03:14:32,370
I wanna keep talking, but I know that you should rest my voice.

5366
03:14:33,030 --> 03:14:34,910
I wanna watch Legally Blonde!

5367
03:14:36,130 --> 03:14:38,270
Oh my god, I'm gonna catch you guys.

5368
03:14:39,210 --> 03:14:41,350
I wanna watch Legally Blonde!

5369
03:14:44,810 --> 03:14:45,430
Rest.

5370
03:14:45,930 --> 03:14:46,650
I will.

5371
03:14:46,930 --> 03:14:47,990
I'll rest my voice.

5372
03:14:48,230 --> 03:14:49,050
I'll rest my voice.

5373
03:14:50,010 --> 03:14:51,490
But I wanna watch...

5374
03:14:55,540 --> 03:14:56,300
Yeah.

5375
03:14:56,980 --> 03:14:58,280
My hopes to watch along?

5376
03:14:58,440 --> 03:15:00,100
Yeah, I wanna do one later this week.

5377
03:15:00,200 --> 03:15:00,700
Is that okay?

5378
03:15:01,440 --> 03:15:02,080
Is that okay?

5379
03:15:08,830 --> 03:15:09,330
Yes,

5380
03:15:15,730 --> 03:15:15,850
please.

5381
03:15:17,530 --> 03:15:24,850
I wanna try it.

5382
03:15:24,930 --> 03:15:26,490
I've never played it before.

5383
03:15:26,910 --> 03:15:27,730
I watch the anime.

5384
03:15:28,710 --> 03:15:30,470
I only watch the first season.

5385
03:15:31,730 --> 03:15:33,430
Umma, umma, umma, umma.

5386
03:15:33,470 --> 03:15:34,630
One, two, three, hi!

5387
03:15:42,610 --> 03:15:45,190
Did you see Northern Lion playing again?

5388
03:15:45,310 --> 03:15:45,530
Yeah!

5389
03:15:45,910 --> 03:15:47,110
Wait, okay, I have a question.

5390
03:15:47,410 --> 03:15:48,410
I followed an account.

5391
03:15:49,030 --> 03:15:49,990
On Twitter?

5392
03:15:51,050 --> 03:15:53,330
Is that Northern Lion's account?

5393
03:15:54,110 --> 03:15:57,530
Because I thought people were telling me it's not his account.

5394
03:15:58,710 --> 03:16:00,230
Is that him?

5395
03:16:00,710 --> 03:16:01,090
Is that him?

5396
03:16:01,090 --> 03:16:01,570
Oh, it's not?

5397
03:16:03,270 --> 03:16:04,750
The librarian?

5398
03:16:05,350 --> 03:16:06,770
That's not him?

5399
03:16:23,240 --> 03:16:25,080
That's a Stan account?

5400
03:16:25,080 --> 03:16:25,200
Yeah!
