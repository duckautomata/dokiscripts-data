1
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,380
Oh...

2
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,640
And no settings on.

3
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,700
Oopsie!

4
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,980
Oopsie!

5
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,940
Do you guys like my outfit?

6
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,060
Cute?

7
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,840
I'm the Christmas bear.

8
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:22,160
Wait, hold on.

9
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,380
YouTube.

10
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,180
There we go.

11
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,600
I am the Christmas bear.

12
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,000
You like it?

13
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,020
Kawaii.

14
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,520
Kawaii!

15
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,880
I hope Minto is one of the spirits that visits.

16
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,980
Well, which one do you want me to be?

17
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Do you want me to be the spirit of the Christmas...

18
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,520
Wait...

19
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,600
Future?

20
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,380
Past?

21
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:55,820
Present?

22
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,290
Minto kawaii.

23
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,090
Present?

24
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,410
The famous Christmas bear.

25
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,150
Yeah, obviously.

26
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,310
Be the ghost of my future.

27
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,990
Wow, that's kind of smooth.

28
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:16,630
Wait.

29
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,890
Wow.

30
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:19,450
Wow.

31
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,830
Sure.

32
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:21,810
Wow.

33
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,450
Kiriha?

34
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,250
Damn.

35
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,710
Dang.

36
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,890
That was pretty good.

37
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,570
There we go.

38
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,550
Anyways guys, welcome to my karaoke!

39
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,130
It's...

40
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,070
It's...

41
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:43,710
It's...

42
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,190
It's...

43
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,330
It's Christmas time!

44
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,350
Actually, we can finally sing Christmas songs for real.

45
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,710
Upside down Lampy.

46
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,210
Thank you for the gift.

47
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:55,910
Thank you!

48
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,070
Not normal Lampy.

49
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,450
Upside down.

50
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,790
Minky, how is kitty?

51
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,370
Kitty is good!

52
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,850
For those who don't know, I had to take my cat to the vet.

53
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,850
Butaro, my older kitty.

54
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,150
Not Paz, my newer kitty.

55
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:18,550
He has been having issues with a little thing on his arm.

56
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,450
And it's infected.

57
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,110
And I noticed it was infected on Thanksgiving.

58
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,570
And I was like, no!

59
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,490
And they weren't open until today.

60
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:34,670
So I got him in today.

61
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,450
And the doctor was like, oh...

62
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,810
I think...

63
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,170
Okay, so I have like three options.

64
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,450
He's like, if it's cancerous...

65
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,230
You'll just have to keep doing surgery to get it cut off.

66
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,510
And if it's...

67
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,310
And you can do radiation, but he was like, I don't recommend it.

68
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,710
And I was like, I don't want to do that.

69
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,810
My cat's too old.

70
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,210
He doesn't want to do radiation.

71
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,010
Or you can cut off his arm.

72
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,670
He was like, you can just keep getting surgery to get the tumor, whatever it is, cut off.

73
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,670
Or you can amputate his arm.

74
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,670
I'm so...

75
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,210
So Butaro's kind of going through it.

76
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,290
Because he has like a cancer in his tummy too.

77
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,910
But I don't think they're related.

78
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,950
He thinks that maybe it's a type of tumor.

79
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,450
If it is cancerous, it's localized.

80
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,750
That is not a hot dog moment!

81
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,050
Oh, sorry.

82
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,830
I realized my notice was turned off.

83
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,610
Um...

84
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,990
Uh, localized to his arm.

85
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,070
So...

86
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,430
I got a dog's arm removed and she did great.

87
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,450
Yeah, I don't...

88
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:51,850
This is...

89
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,690
I went to see what her options are first.

90
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,730
So, you know.

91
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,490
Yeah, he's old.

92
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,450
I don't want to take his arm off.

93
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,560
So, you know.

94
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,340
He's been in a cone and he's been sad.

95
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,880
So I've been sad for him.

96
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,760
Sorry, I didn't want to start the stream like this.

97
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,460
I'm feeling a little more optimistic about it than pessimistic.

98
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,560
Because he's been...

99
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,880
Overall, he's been good.

100
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,320
Even today, he was playing with Paz.

101
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,540
So, you know.

102
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,080
And he's still eating and drinking and doing just fine.

103
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,920
Just has a little bit of a rough time.

104
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,720
Announcement, good.

105
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,620
My cat has cancer.

106
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:46,980
No!

107
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:48,980
No!

108
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,200
No, he's...

109
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,120
They're still...

110
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,540
They're still...

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,240
They're still playing and he's been good.

112
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

113
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,060
But that's...

114
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,800
This is not the announcement, by the way.

115
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,580
This is not the announcement.

116
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,700
Oh my gosh, my computer's been so slow today.

117
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,520
I do not know why.

118
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,420
The announcement will be in...

119
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,000
Sometime.

120
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,940
I can't give it to you right away.

121
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,220
I can't give it to you right now.

122
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,240
We have to sing first.

123
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,220
We must sing for the announcement.

124
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,480
Oh my gosh.

125
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,200
Which I have...

126
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,880
Wanting to do in like 15...

127
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,560
No, sorry.

128
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,880
Wait, what?

129
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,860
Let's sing a song!

130
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,400
I didn't say anything.

131
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,640
Let's sing a Christmas song!

132
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,640
What's a Christmas song we can sing first?

133
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,500
What's a Christmas song we can sing first?

134
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,020
Back from Japan, can watch streams again.

135
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,160
David, I saw you post some pictures around Akiba.

136
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,040
They were so good.

137
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:06,900
Jingle bells!

138
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,920
Spooky scary skeletons.

139
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,080
That's a Christmas song!

140
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,840
Or, I say Christmas.

141
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:12,720
Winter too.

142
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,100
Jingle bell rock!

143
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,800
Alright, let's sing a jingle bell rock.

144
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,080
I don't know which one is a good one to sing.

145
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,020
Let's sing...

146
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,180
Whatever this one is.

147
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,540
I didn't warm up as I usually don't before a stream.

148
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,360
Oopsie.

149
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,540
So, I might have to warm up a bit.

150
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,770
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.

151
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,910
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring.

152
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,710
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun.

153
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,670
Now the jingle hop has begun.

154
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:57,690
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.

155
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:02,010
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time.

156
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,610
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square.

157
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:09,470
In the frosty air.

158
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,770
What a bright time, it's the right time.

159
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,710
To rock the night away.

160
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:22,030
Jingle bell time is a swell time.

161
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,750
To go gliding in a one horse sleigh.

162
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,390
Giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet.

163
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,650
Jingle around the clock.

164
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:35,210
Mix... mix?

165
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,470
Jingle in feet.

166
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,850
That's the jingle bell rock.

167
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,650
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.

168
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,690
Jingle bell chime in jingle bell time.

169
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:53,390
Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square.

170
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,690
In the frosty air.

171
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:01,950
What a bright time, it's the right time.

172
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,290
To rock the night away.

173
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,350
A hock to a hock.

174
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,150
Swell time.

175
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,190
To go gliding in a one horse sleigh.

176
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,910
Giddy up jingle horse, pick up your feet.

177
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,990
Jingle around the clock.

178
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,930
Mix and a mingle in the jingling feet.

179
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,550
That's the jingle bell.

180
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,690
That's the jingle bell.

181
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,370
That's the jingle bell rock.

182
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:46,310
I've only seen like the ones... For some reason I keep seeing them being made of blue archive.

183
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,470
Like why?

184
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:55,190
Jingle bell rock of the skibbity skibbity hock to a hock.

185
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,330
That one, you know.

186
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,910
I'm putting you in a trash compactor.

187
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,570
And this is only 50% cute aggression?

188
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,410
What?

189
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:04,730
Stop!

190
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,230
Shut up!

191
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,090
What are you talking about?

192
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,050
Paddle, paddle.

193
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,030
Hashi de sori yo.

194
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,350
Kaze no you ni.

195
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,730
Tsukimi haraba.

196
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,870
Paddle, paddle.

197
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:27,710
Everytime you sing I'm reminded you have a voice of an angel.

198
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:28,350
No!

199
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,310
What are you talking about?

200
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,630
That was way too high for me.

201
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,990
Rotate to a 45 degree angle and leave you there.

202
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:37,230
No!

203
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,630
Do you happen to know Little Saint Nick by the Beach Boys?

204
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,070
That's the one that's like Little Saint Nick.

205
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,590
Little Saint Nick.

206
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,510
Little Saint Nick.

207
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,890
Thank you Daryl.

208
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,830
Little Saint Nick.

209
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,270
Little Saint Nick.

210
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,270
It's a Little Saint Nick.

211
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,530
Little Saint Nick.

212
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:13,330
Happy December.

213
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,890
Happy December!

214
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,750
People talk about Mariah, but for me December is when Nero is released.

215
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,090
Paddle, paddle.

216
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,490
Do you want a hippopotamus?

217
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:25,690
Let's do it!

218
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,610
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

219
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,030
Metronome!

220
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,410
Thank you so much for the Akatono.

221
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,330
Akasupa.

222
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:43,010
How can an angel with such a cute voice have such terminal brain rot?

223
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,470
Sorry I have the brain rot.

224
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,530
Merry Christmas Finto.

225
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,330
Merry Christmas!

226
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:52,610
It's only December 2nd, but you know...

227
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,150
You know.

228
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,690
It's Christmas season.

229
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,650
We gotta get into the season early, you know.

230
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,070
Hayden, thanks for the 10 gifted.

231
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:00,830
Thank you!

232
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,670
Let's do it.

233
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,950
Christmas hippopotamus.

234
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,570
Who came up with this idea?

235
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,650
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

236
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,610
Only a hippopotamus will do.

237
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,610
I don't want a doll, no dinky dinker toy.

238
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,670
I want a hippopotamus to play with and enjoy.

239
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:36,970
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

240
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,850
I don't think Santa Claus will mind, do you?

241
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,970
He won't have to use our dirty chimney flue.

242
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,970
Just bring him through the front door, that's the easy thing to do.

243
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:58,050
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs.

244
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:06,510
Oh, what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes to see a hippo hero standing there.

245
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:10,010
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

246
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,830
Only a hippopotamus will do.

247
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,670
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses.

248
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,770
I only like hippopotamuses.

249
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,310
And hippopotamuses like me too.

250
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:31,830
How do you spell hippopotamus?

251
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,290
Oh, I wonder, hippo.

252
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,310
Mom says the hippo would eat me up but then.

253
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,930
Teacher says a hippo is a vegetarian.

254
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,350
Is that true?

255
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,440
There's a lot of room for him in our two-car garage.

256
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,480
I'll feed him there and wash him there and give him a massage.

257
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,180
I can see me now on Christmas morning, creeping down the stairs.

258
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:16,240
Oh, what joy and what surprise when I open up my eyes to see a hippo hero standing there.

259
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,600
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

260
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,740
Only a hippopotamus will do.

261
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,400
No crocodiles or rhinoceroses.

262
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,460
I only like hippopotamuses.

263
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,660
And hippopotamuses like me too.

264
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,120
Hippo... wait.

265
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,260
Hippo... hippopotamus.

266
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:57,660
I want a hippopotamus for Christmas.

267
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,220
Did I spell that right?

268
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,400
You fell from heaven.

269
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:05,820
Stop!

270
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,080
No.

271
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm a ghost.

272
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,940
Hippo... hippopotamus.

273
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
Hippo... hippopotamus.

274
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,860
It's correct, right?

275
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:32,090
I... I think it's right.

276
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,650
It meant it was my birthday and I'm excited for the news.

277
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,550
It may have been a rough holiday weekend, but getting a karaoke for my Kamiyoshi makes it special nonetheless.

278
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,330
VALDI, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

279
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:48,710
Happy birthday to you.

280
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,450
Happy... Oh, two birthdays!

281
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,590
Happy birthday to you.

282
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,930
Happy birthday dear Valdi.

283
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,350
Happy birthday to you.

284
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,390
Wait.

285
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,590
Wait.

286
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,790
And Mish!

287
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:11,370
Happy birthday to you.

288
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,490
Happy birthday to you.

289
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,270
Happy birthday dear Mish.

290
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,570
Happy birthday to you.

291
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,090
Happy birthday!

292
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,630
Also, welcome from LimeMoose community.

293
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,230
Hello, hello, hello.

294
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,490
Thank you for the Haka, it's super!

295
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,410
Feliz Navidad.

296
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,890
Okay, I can sing a Feliz Navidad.

297
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,030
Feliz Navidad.

298
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,590
And then I don't have to sing just only English or Spanish.

299
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,490
I can sing in Japanese too.

300
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:52,930
I guess this counts as English kind of.

301
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,670
Probably.

302
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:56,170
But it's Spanish.

303
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,530
She did you so dirty during crab game.

304
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,350
I know!

305
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,170
Liz!

306
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,910
Oh my gosh, hello!

307
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,030
You look super cute.

308
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:10,730
Stop it.

309
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,810
You are so beautiful.

310
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,690
I want to see you in this too.

311
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:20,730
I want to see you perfectly because you are red.

312
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,270
Feliz Navidad.

313
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,570
Let's sing it.

314
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,240
Thank you for the gifted you guys.

315
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,100
Thank you!

316
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,540
For some reason my chat is like all messed up.

317
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,940
Like my computer is kind of slow today.

318
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,560
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,060
So it's hard for me to scroll up and if I miss something...

320
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,880
Feliz Navidad.

321
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,000
Feliz Navidad.

322
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,180
Feliz Navidad.

323
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,200
Prospero año y felicidad.

324
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,560
Feliz Navidad.

325
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,840
Feliz Navidad.

326
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,000
Feliz Navidad.

327
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,080
Prospero año y felicidad.

328
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,360
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,660
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

330
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:25,300
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

331
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,380
I wish you a Merry Christmas.

332
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,680
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

333
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:38,140
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

334
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,500
Feliz Navidad.

335
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,540
It's kind of high.

336
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,720
Feliz Navidad.

337
00:20:45,180 --> 00:21:32,400

I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

341
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:08,760
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

342
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,380
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

343
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,760
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

344
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,840
I want to wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart.

345
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,740
Feliz Navidad.

346
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,000
Feliz Navidad.

347
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,200
Feliz Navidad.

348
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,100
Prospero año y felicidad.

349
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,400
Oh, that's it?

350
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,220
Frogbert?

351
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:42,940
No.

352
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,880
I mean I could do Frogbert version of something.

353
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,540
Oh, someone sent this one.

354
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:47,860
This one.

355
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,300
This one.

356
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,000
Grandma got run over by a rain.

357
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,380
Did I spell that right?

358
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,200
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,440
OK.

360
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,680
When is a very Minto Christmas album dropping?

361
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,680
Let's do this one.

362
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,600
Good Spanish.

363
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,260
Thank you.

364
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:08,940
Gracias.

365
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:14,240
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

366
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,660
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

367
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,920
You can say there's no such thing as Santa.

368
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,620
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

369
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,280
She'd been drinking too much eggnog.

370
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,100
And we begged her not to go.

371
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,740
Oh, Grandma.

372
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,420
But she forgot her medication.

373
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,980
And she staggered out the door into the snow.

374
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,420
When we found her Christmas morning.

375
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,580
At the scene of the attack.

376
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,760
Oh my God!

377
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,300
She had hoof prints on her forehead.

378
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,300
And incriminating claw marks on her back.

379
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,840
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

380
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:11,480
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

381
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,360
You can say there's no such thing as Santa.

382
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,240
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

383
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,440
Now we're all so proud of Grandpa.

384
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,820
He's been taking this so well.

385
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,200
See him in there watching football.

386
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,460
Drinking beer and playing cards with Cousin Mel.

387
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:41,960
It's not Christmas without Grandma.

388
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,220
All the family's dressed in black.

389
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:51,000
And we just can't help but wonder.

390
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,800
Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

391
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,840
Oh no!

392
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,300
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

393
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,920
Santa walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

394
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,060
You can say there's no such thing as Santa.

395
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,880
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

396
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,320
Now the goose is on the table.

397
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,100
So sad.

398
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,220
And the pudding's made of fig.

399
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,160
And the blue and silver candles.

400
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,260
That would just have matched the hair in Grandma's wig.

401
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,760
I've warned all my friends and neighbors.

402
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,840
Better watch out for yourselves.

403
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,620
They should never give a license.

404
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,720
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.

405
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,600
Oh no!

406
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,940
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

407
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,780
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

408
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,700
Now you can say there's no such thing as Santa.

409
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,380
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

410
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,920
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

411
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,360
Walking home from our house Christmas Eve.

412
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,100
You can say there's no such thing as Santa.

413
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,040
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe.

414
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,760
I should have gone higher.

415
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,520
I didn't realize it.

416
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,640
I thought I was going to say something else.

417
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:43,500
Feliz Navidad and Grandma got run over by a reindeer.

418
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,020
Yay!

419
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,140
Alrighty guys.

420
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,780
Hold on one moment please.

421
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,560
Sorry I was reading what was on the screen.

422
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:08,840
I will wait for a few moments.

423
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,380
Perhaps.

424
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,040
I will wait maybe a few minutes.

425
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,440
Yes.

426
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,320
Someone.

427
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,480
Birthday.

428
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,780
More birthday.

429
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,940
I'm glad to have a Minto karaoke on my birthday.

430
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,900
I will always enjoy your singing.

431
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,360
Thank you someone.

432
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,120
One more time.

433
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,860
I hope you... I misspelled reindeer.

434
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,440
No I didn't.

435
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,040
Thank you for the Haka Shoputo.

436
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,180
Happy birthday to you.

437
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,300
Happy birthday to you.

438
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,040
Happy birthday dear someone.

439
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,280
Happy birthday to you.

440
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,540
One more time.

441
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,560
Happy birthday to you!

442
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,700
Happy birthday to you!

443
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Happy birthday, Devious Paul!

444
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,340
Happy birthday to you!

445
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,480
Happy birthday, everybody!

446
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,020
So many birthdays, so many birthdays.

447
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,680
Alrighty.

448
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:25,420
Someone said another song.

449
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,240
Cannot unhear the gramps got run over by a seme.

450
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,500
What?

451
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,580
Yaoi?

452
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,680
Santar.

453
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,800
Santar is... yeah.

454
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,000
Santar.

455
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,600
Santar, Santar.

456
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,680
Sing that version.

457
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,860
I don't know that version.

458
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,320
I don't know the Yaoi Christmas carols.

459
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,360
I have no idea.

460
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,500
When is Yaoi Christmas carol?

461
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,860
I guess I have to do a part 2.

462
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,420
And learn all the Yaoi versions of these songs.

463
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,760
What?

464
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:09,840
Santar.

465
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,460
Last Christmas?

466
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,060
I feel like I don't know this song very well, but I'll sing it.

467
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,400
What movies do you have lined up for Christmas?

468
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,560
Die Hard?

469
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,020
I don't know.

470
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,560
I'm doing a members watch along of Indiana Jones on Friday.

471
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,700
I had no idea.

472
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I completely didn't even plan this.

473
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,680
But on Friday is the release of the Indiana Jones game!

474
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,520
So I think I have to... I think I have to... I don't know.

475
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,380
I want to play the Indiana Jones game.

476
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,820
So I'm like, which movies?

477
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,300
1 through 3?

478
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,340
Yeah, 1 through 3.

479
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,900
So I'm like, maybe I play Indiana Jones in the morning and then members watch along.

480
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,560
I thought that was intentional.

481
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:06,880
No!

482
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,240
I just... I have... I have Indie vision.

483
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,760
I have Indie brain.

484
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,840
I had no idea.

485
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,840
I had no idea.

486
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,440
So I'm like, what do I do?

487
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,300
All I want for Christmas is you.

488
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,440
We'll get to that one.

489
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,420
We have to work ourselves up to that one, right?

490
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,180
Davey's song from Eight Crazy Nights.

491
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,960
I don't know it.

492
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:36,610
That one.

493
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,430
Hold on.

494
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,290
One second.

495
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,640
Ok.

496
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,360
Guys, I have an announcement to make.

497
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,220
I guess I'll make it now.

498
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,400
So that I... Oh, I gotta change my timer.

499
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,220
Oh gosh.

500
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,260
Actually, let's sing one more song and then I'll do the announcement.

501
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,680
Ok, one second.

502
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,300
Let me do one more song and then I'll do...

503
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,360
Let's do...

504
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,720
What's a 3 minute song?

505
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,260
Christmas.

506
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,980
Let me just search Christmas.

507
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,020
There.

508
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,940
Oh no, now I need 2 minutes.

509
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,760
Jingle bells!

510
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,880
Jingle bells!

511
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,240
There we go.

512
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,740
I'm gonna turn the key up though.

513
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,360
Oh wait.

514
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,120
Jingle bells!

515
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,400
Wait, I was wrong.

516
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,680
Let me turn the key down.

517
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,780
There we go.

518
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,700
It sounds demonic now.

519
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,020
Laughing all the way.

520
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,620
Bells on bobtails ring.

521
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,860
Making spirits bright.

522
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,180
What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight.

523
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,760
Jingle bells!

524
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,820
Jingle bells!

525
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,600
Jingle all the way.

526
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:54,140
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

527
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,640
Jingle bells!

528
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Jingle bells!

529
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,560
Jingle all the way.

530
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,020
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

531
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:07,320
A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride.

532
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:12,000
And soon Miss Fanny Bright was seated at my side.

533
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,200
The horse was lean and lank.

534
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,440
Misfortune seemed his lot.

535
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,580
We got into a drifted bank and then we got upside.

536
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,280
Jingle bells!

537
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,340
Jingle bells!

538
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,820
Is the horse okay?

539
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,700
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

540
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,160
Jingle bells!

541
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,260
Jingle bells!

542
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,000
Jingle all the way.

543
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,700
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

544
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,040
Dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh.

545
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,160
Over the fields we go, laughing all the way.

546
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,600
Bells on bobtails ring.

547
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,900
Making spirits bright.

548
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,280
What fun it is to laugh and sing a sleighing song tonight.

549
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,940
Jingle bells!

550
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:58,920
Jingle bells!

551
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,740
Jingle all the way.

552
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,060
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

553
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Jingle bells!

554
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,800
Jingle bells!

555
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,680
Jingle all the way.

556
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,380
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh.

557
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,140
Oh, okay, sorry.

558
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,200
I thought we were going to do the dramatic like...

559
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,900
One horse open sleigh.

560
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,640
You know?

561
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,320
Okay, nevermind.

562
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,600
Guys, I have an announcement.

563
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,320
The announcement is that in...

564
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,880
My first ever my own merch drop.

565
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:56,330
In 20 minutes the site will open.

566
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,310
And you can purchase such things as...

567
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,530
Such things as...

568
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,350
Things that I announced back in June.

569
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,770
And such as... Wait, I have nothing prepared.

570
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:17,830
Oh my gosh.

571
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,790
Oh, the link!

572
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:20,710
Yes, the link.

573
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:21,950
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

574
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,970
The link is...

575
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,430
Wait, you guys got to stop the chat.

576
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,310
Because I have to...

577
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,210
It's pinned!

578
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:38,770
Now, replace the pinned message.

579
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,430
Oh, sorry, I just realized my pinned message was still about my cat.

580
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,470
I was like, why are so many people asking about my cat?

581
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:52,310
Shop.moso.moe.sashamintophantom You can't see the stuff right now, but there's actually also...

582
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:55,450
Some other things that are...

583
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,690
That are new as well.

584
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,310
Things that...

585
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,190
That I didn't announce before.

586
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,130
So...

587
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:05,450
What's the test?

588
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,350
Oh, test, yeah.

589
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,150
Test.

590
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,950
Test.

591
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,270
So, there will be things such as my first plushie.

592
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:21,170
The little tiny Minto plushie.

593
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,870
And things like...

594
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:28,190
Like... This is the only picture I have available.

595
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:28,910
Oh my gosh.

596
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,610
My... This thingy.

597
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,870
Which is a...

598
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,610
Like a Lego block version of me.

599
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,110
And...

600
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,890
Oh gosh, I'm nervous.

601
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:39,690
Sorry.

602
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,250
I have no pictures of plushie...

603
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:45,690
Of little plushie Minto.

604
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,270
But trust, she's cute.

605
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,750
And...

606
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,830
There's some other things as well.

607
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,830
Some other things that Moso...

608
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,150
Moso helped with organizing.

609
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,610
So, not just those things.

610
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,830
And Dakimakura should be up...

611
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,930
Soon-ish, I think.

612
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,770
Dakimakura, I think, is a different link.

613
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,330
It might be on there.

614
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,770
I'm not quite sure what's going on.

615
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,050
But...

616
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,470
Also...

617
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,950
The Dakimakura is a limited time thing.

618
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:24,330
So, you have until the end of the month to order it.

619
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:26,730
Order should be going out...

620
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,590
Sometime next month.

621
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:32,190
So...

622
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,290
Yes, yes.

623
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,630
Yes, yes.

624
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,630
Legally distinct interlocking plastic blocks.

625
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:46,170
Yes.

626
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,750
It's actually another company called Mythical Blocks.

627
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,210
I'm their first ever western Vtuber.

628
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:54,110
That they are working with.

629
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:56,070
Is everything limited in number?

630
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,250
Plushies and...

631
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,250
Mint blocks are limited in number.

632
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,490
Yes, I believe the mint blocks...

633
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,230
I don't know if they will ever restock.

634
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,950
So...

635
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,710
Yeah.

636
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,870
You know.

637
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,230
So...

638
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,950
Plushies, I would love to restock those, you know, obviously.

639
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,930
What did I just sing?

640
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:27,870
Oh, Jingle Bells.

641
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,590
Sorry, I'm nervous.

642
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,210
I'm nervous.

643
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,670
I'm nervous, okay.

644
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:39,990
Wait.

645
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:40,690
Oh!

646
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,110
Daki will be up.

647
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:42,970
Okay, thank you.

648
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:43,850
I got confirmation.

649
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,590
Oh, here, hold on.

650
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,010
They're sending me photos.

651
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:50,210
Can I show the other things too?

652
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:54,010
There's some other little cute goodies in there.

653
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,110
This is the...

654
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,910
This is the Bagel Plush.

655
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:00,930
Bagel Minto Plushies.

656
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,070
There are many of them.

657
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,210
So...

658
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,330
Trust that you can get one.

659
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,550
I believe in you.

660
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,930
There are many of them.

661
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,710
There are many, many that I ordered.

662
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,130
So trust.

663
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,030
Maybe I'll leave the other things for a surprise, actually.

664
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,890
Like the...

665
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,910
There's some, like I said, there's some other cute things.

666
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:24,890
And yeah.

667
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,450
Oh, I should not hide the countdown.

668
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,630
All these...

669
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,350
Wait, actually, let me bring that back.

670
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:31,910
These will all be up...

671
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,270
In 15 minutes.

672
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:38,750
So let's keep singing.

673
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,910
And then I'll take a break.

674
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:44,350
So I guess you can get some stuff if you want to.

675
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:44,370
Oh.

676
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,430
What do you mean?

677
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:54,550
Maybe.

678
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,280
No!

679
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,480
Not here.

680
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,860
Will there be a bundle option?

681
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:06,540
I tried to.

682
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,260
Unfortunately, I do not have a bundle option.

683
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:11,920
I don't think.

684
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,720
I don't know.

685
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
You have many questions.

686
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,190
I'll take 10.

687
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:32,210
Bye, bye, bye.

688
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,970
If you want, you know.

689
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,870
No worries if you can't.

690
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:37,870
Oh, and yes, there is international shipping.

691
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,510
Yes, yes.

692
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,210
So, yes, international shipping.

693
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:42,750
Okay.

694
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:42,890
Okay.

695
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:51,650
Moso has been so awesome with helping me out with setting up a store.

696
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,570
And doing fulfillment and everything.

697
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,470
And all this for me.

698
00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:01,250
So, I very much appreciate their help.

699
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,170
And sorry it took so long for merch.

700
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:06,830
But we're here, baby.

701
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,130
I don't know what I'm doing.

702
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:08,650
I don't know what I'm doing.

703
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:12,110
I don't know what I'm doing.

704
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,950
I'm doing my best.

705
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,270
I am doing my best, that's all.

706
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,130
Yes, but hopefully you guys can enjoy some stuff.

707
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:28,690
Thank you for the 20 gifts.

708
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,370
Thank you.

709
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,750
I've never done my own merch drop before.

710
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:37,810
And I knew very quickly when I ordered stuff.

711
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,730
Such as the plushies and the mythical blocks.

712
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:43,090
That I was way in over my head.

713
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:45,990
So, yes.

714
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,430
My first ever merch drop.

715
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:49,250
In 12 minutes.

716
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,080
Hello, everybody.

717
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,980
Let's sing a song to welcome in the raiders.

718
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,680
What's a winter song we can sing?

719
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,520
What's a song we can sing?

720
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,590
We love you too much to make this easy for you.

721
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,470
What do you mean by that?

722
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:15,770
Santa baby?

723
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,150
Okay.

724
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,650
That's the Ariana Grande song, right?

725
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:21,050
Wait, is it Ariana Grande?

726
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:23,890
The Santa baby.

727
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,630
Oh no, that's Santa tell me.

728
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:31,350
Santa tell me.

729
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:37,930
I know.

730
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:39,190
Santa baby.

731
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,550
Thank you for the 20 gifted.

732
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,150
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

733
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:46,310
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

734
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,490
And someone else.

735
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,450
Thank you for the 5 gifted.

736
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:49,830
Okay.

737
00:42:50,290 --> 00:42:50,970
Santa baby.

738
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,770
I think I know this one.

739
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,320
Pretty sure I know this one.

740
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,660
Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree for me.

741
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:31,940
Been an awful good girl, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

742
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:45,340
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, light blue.

743
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:54,680
I'll wait up for you, dear Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

744
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,160
Think of all the fun I've missed.

745
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:10,600
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed.

746
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,180
Next year I could be just as good.

747
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:28,480
If you check off my Christmas list, Santa baby, I want a yacht and not really that...

748
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,500
Wait, wait, and really that's not a lot.

749
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,700
Can't read.

750
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:40,020
Been an angel all year, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

751
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,200
This song is just asking for a bunch of expensive stuff.

752
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,720
Santa honey, one little thing I really need, the deed.

753
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:02,500
To a platinum mine, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

754
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:15,160
Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with the duplex and checks.

755
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:25,020
Sign your X on the line, Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight.

756
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:40,770
Come and trim my Christmas tree with some decorations bought at Tiffany's.

757
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:51,050
I really do believe in you, let's see if you believe in me.

758
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:59,750
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring.

759
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:09,150
I don't mean on the phone, Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight.

760
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,790
Hurry down the chimney tonight.

761
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,050
Hurry...tonight.

762
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:27,490
It's too embarrassing!

763
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,530
No!

764
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,720
Oh my gosh, Santa baby.

765
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,920
It's too embarrassing.

766
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,230
Song is about Santa's Discord kitten.

767
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,870
You have the perfect baby doll voice.

768
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:49,790
What does that mean?

769
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:55,370
Driving home for Christmas, I don't know if I know that one actually.

770
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,690
Team Red, welcome to my workshop.

771
00:46:58,030 --> 00:46:58,470
Thank you.

772
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,410
It's a Marilyn Monroe song.

773
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:02,210
Is it?

774
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:08,270
Oh, I do see Ariana Grande covered that one.

775
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:13,180
Let's see if you believe in me.

776
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,000
I thought about it too.

777
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,940
I was like, do you believe in ghosts?

778
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,540
Let's do this one.

779
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,100
I think I know this one.

780
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:28,480
I think I know this one.

781
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,800
Sorry, my voice is a little...

782
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,620
Let's try it.

783
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:58,520
For Christmas, you can plan on me.

784
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:12,760
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents on the tree.

785
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:29,760
Christmas Eve will find me where the love light gleams.

786
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:53,300
I'll be home for Christmas If only in my dreams.

787
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:02,140
Be home for Christmas.

788
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,500
You can plan on me.

789
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:31,060
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents.

790
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:36,280
Oh, sands on the tree.

791
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:49,280
Christmas Eve will find me.

792
00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:00,290
Light gleams.

793
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:12,890
I'll be home for Christmas.

794
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:28,270
If only in my dreams.

795
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,510
Four minutes.

796
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,630
Four minutes left.

797
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,070
Four minutes.

798
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,670
That one was a different version.

799
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,490
Be home for Christmas.

800
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:47,150
That was a different version than what I'm used to, I feel.

801
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,550
I feel.

802
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:51,870
It's a little different.

803
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:54,390
Up on the rooftop.

804
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,870
Yeah!

805
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,010
Up on the rooftop.

806
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,750
Up on the rooftop.

807
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:02,490
Up on the rooftop.

808
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,150
I think this one.

809
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:07,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

810
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:09,230
Up on the rooftop.

811
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:11,730
I used to do Christmas carols at the old people's homes.

812
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,290
I'd be like, I'm a ghost!

813
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,210
See you soon!

814
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:21,530
Up on the housetop, reindeer paws.

815
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,390
What is that?

816
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,490
Oh, Santa Claus.

817
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,410
Down through the chimney with lots of toys.

818
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:31,670
All for the little ones, Christmas joy.

819
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,070
What is the tune?

820
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,510
Hold on.

821
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:35,150
Who wouldn't go?

822
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:36,950
Oh, oh, oh.

823
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,610
Who wouldn't go?

824
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,590
Up on the housetop.

825
00:51:40,790 --> 00:51:41,910
Click, click, click.

826
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,550
Down through the chimney with ones.

827
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,390
Good Saint Nick.

828
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:46,210
It's old, right?

829
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,450
I thought he was old.

830
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:48,590
Not good.

831
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:55,770
First come the stocking of little Nell.

832
00:51:56,170 --> 00:51:59,230
Oh, dear Santa, fill it well.

833
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,770
Give her a dolly that laughs and cries.

834
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:06,150
One that will open and shut her eyes.

835
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:08,010
Oh, oh, oh.

836
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,730
Sorry, I thought he was old.

837
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:12,970
Who wouldn't go?

838
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:14,810
Up on the housetop.

839
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:16,250
Click, click, click.

840
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:19,690
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

841
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:28,570
Oh, oh, oh.

842
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:30,050
Who wouldn't go?

843
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:31,970
Oh, oh, oh.

844
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,470
Who wouldn't go?

845
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:35,510
Up on the housetop.

846
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,730
Click, click, click.

847
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,470
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

848
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,610
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

849
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:48,450
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

850
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,950
I'm trying to be all dramatic and these instrumentals are not letting me.

851
00:52:57,490 --> 00:52:59,130
I'm trying to hit the high notes here.

852
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:04,570
Up on the house... on the e-house.

853
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:11,310
Up on the housetop.

854
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:14,210
Click, click, click.

855
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:17,860
Oh, oh, oh.

856
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,160
Sorry.

857
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:18,960
Oh, my gosh.

858
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:19,620
Tiktok is playing.

859
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:21,900
Oh, my gosh.

860
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,980
We have one minute, you guys.

861
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:24,560
I'm gonna go grab a snack.

862
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,800
And... Actually, I'm just gonna... Actually, I can eat some here.

863
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:32,660
I have a snack here.

864
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,920
I have some Jagarico.

865
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,140
Oh, my gosh.

866
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,920
Oh, it's almost time though.

867
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,740
It's almost time.

868
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,460
Wait, let me see.

869
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:42,460
Wait, maybe it is time.

870
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,280
Wait, hold on.

871
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:43,920
Let me check the website.

872
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,640
Hold on.

873
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:51,700
Oh, no.

874
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,320
It's coming soon.

875
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:52,580
OK.

876
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,700
One minute left.

877
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,680
One minute left.

878
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,200
I think my computer is a little fast.

879
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:57,240
Sorry.

880
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:57,540
OK.

881
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,940
Let me put on some music while I chomp.

882
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:03,900
Sorry, I started to get... I started to get shaky hungry.

883
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,180
The link is pinned message.

884
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,280
The link is in the pinned message, everybody.

885
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,020
I really think it'll be fine on stock.

886
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,100
Gotta keep that blood sugar up.

887
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:29,440
I know.

888
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,760
The website is dead?

889
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,640
No, I don't think so.

890
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:38,700
I don't think so.

891
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,250
Sorry, I'm eating.

892
00:54:43,950 --> 00:54:44,650
Sorry, I'm eating.

893
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,380
I'm refreshing too.

894
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:50,880
I'm nervous.

895
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,020
I'm nervous.

896
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,960
Is it up?

897
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,800
The website is down?

898
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,980
Oh, the site crashed.

899
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,600
While we wait, I can show you some of the other things.

900
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,820
I can show you some of the other fun merchandise things.

901
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,680
Oh, no.

902
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,560
The other extra things as well.

903
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,000
Hold on.

904
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,920
Let me actually put this all in like a...

905
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,540
In like a slideshow.

906
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,360
That might be better.

907
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,580
OK, hold on.

908
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,420
Let me save them.

909
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,040
That might be better.

910
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,560
Save.

911
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,040
Save.

912
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,560
Save.

913
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,400
Save.

914
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,320
I'm sorry.

915
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,460
But for now, let me share with you the things that...

916
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,480
Besides the block and the plushie, we have...

917
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,080
We have a keychain!

918
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,320
So cute.

919
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,640
Look how cute, cute, cute we have a keychain.

920
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,080
Very, very cute.

921
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,260
We have...

922
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,600
We have the vinyl sticker.

923
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:22,460
We got the art.

924
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,400
We got the permission from Oro...

925
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:28,620
For a sticker.

926
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:33,220
I think many people liked this one.

927
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,200
So you can now own it as a sticker.

928
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,000
We have a diorama of me in a little cafe.

929
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:41,760
So cute.

930
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

931
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,440
Very, very cute.

932
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,820
And then lastly we have...

933
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:52,140
Some acrylic magnets!

934
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:55,220
So you can have me coming from your walls.

935
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:00,320
I'm in your walls and I'm peeping out of your walls.

936
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,500
Or your fridge.

937
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,180
Or wherever you want to put me.

938
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:05,700
Very cute.

939
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,600
Very, very cute.

940
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,220
It's a set of four.

941
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:10,620
Yeah.

942
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,580
Originally they sent me some sketches for the four of them.

943
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,820
And they were like, which one would you like?

944
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,500
And I was like, I want all of them please.

945
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:25,960
So, yay!

946
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,220
We have these as well.

947
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,880
That are in the merch drop.

948
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:35,140
Oh gosh, I'm nervous.

949
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,240
Is it up yet?

950
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:44,280
They said they even upgraded the site, the server.

951
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,100
But it's still crashing.

952
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,000
No way.

953
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:52,680
How many of you are trying to even get on there?

954
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,100
One at a time.

955
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:55,980
Single file.

956
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:03,660
All of us.

957
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,060
Should we sing another song?

958
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,660
Thank you for the superchats, by the way.

959
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,520
Have more snack monies.

960
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,500
Sorry for crunching in your ears, you guys.

961
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:55,260
I'm really sorry if it's...

962
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:01,670
Sing another song?

963
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:02,710
Let's sing another song.

964
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:04,110
What should we sing?

965
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,590
Let's sing another Christmas winter song.

966
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:11,170
I'm gonna need a little bit more though.

967
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:11,910
Hold on, sorry.

968
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:12,630
I need some more.

969
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:18,010
My ectoplasm is low.

970
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:19,790
Ectoplasm low.

971
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,820
I'm here for Christmas.

972
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:29,080
Oh my gosh, yeah!

973
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,860
What are you munching on?

974
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:34,640
Some veggie chips.

975
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,980
Buddy, what are you munching on?

976
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:43,880
Snacks, buddy.

977
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,680
Snacks, buddy.

978
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:48,180
Buddy, what are you munching on?

979
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,640
Snacks, buddy.

980
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,560
Snacks, buddy.

981
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:15,160
Nightmare before Christmas.

982
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,700
I'm gonna... Let's see.

983
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,560
How can I move these?

984
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,060
Let's make this one a bit smaller.

985
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,140
And move this up and move this over here.

986
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:29,660
Perfect.

987
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:32,540
Perfect.

988
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:33,600
Alright.

989
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,240
But not a Halloween song.

990
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,580
We'll do this one.

991
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:42,650
What's this?

992
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:43,370
What's this?

993
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,650
There's color everywhere.

994
01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:45,570
What's this?

995
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,070
There's white things in the air.

996
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:47,790
What's this?

997
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:49,230
I can't believe my eyes.

998
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,010
I must be dreaming.

999
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:50,750
Wake up, Minto!

1000
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,610
This isn't fair!

1001
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:52,290
What's this?

1002
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:55,210
What's this?

1003
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:55,950
What's this?

1004
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,450
There's something very wrong.

1005
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,150
What's this?

1006
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,750
There's people singing songs.

1007
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:00,370
What's this?

1008
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:02,550
The streets are lined with little creatures laughing.

1009
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,030
Everybody seems so happy.

1010
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:05,570
Have I possibly gone daffy?

1011
01:02:05,770 --> 01:02:06,510
What is this?

1012
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:07,850
What's this?

1013
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:12,970
There's children throwing snowballs instead of throwing heads.

1014
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:15,910
They're busy building toys and absolutely no one's dead.

1015
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:17,410
There's frost on every window.

1016
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:19,030
I can't believe my eyes.

1017
01:02:19,030 --> 01:02:24,430
And in my bones, I feel the warmth that's coming from inside.

1018
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,810
Oh, look.

1019
01:02:26,070 --> 01:02:26,550
What's this?

1020
01:02:26,770 --> 01:02:27,970
They're hanging mistletoe.

1021
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:28,810
They kiss?

1022
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:30,170
Why, that looks so unique.

1023
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:30,990
It's fire!

1024
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:33,230
They're gathering around to hear a story.

1025
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:34,850
Roasting chestnuts on a fire.

1026
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:35,470
What's this?

1027
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:36,290
I can't speak.

1028
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:38,370
What's this?

1029
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,590
And here, they've got a little tree.

1030
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:41,270
How queer!

1031
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:42,770
And who would ever think?

1032
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:43,530
And why?

1033
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,670
They're covering it with tiny little things.

1034
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,490
They've got electric light on strings and there's a smile on everyone.

1035
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:50,090
So now, correct me if I'm wrong.

1036
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:50,830
This looks like fun.

1037
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:51,550
This looks like fun.

1038
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,090
Oh, could it be I got my wish?

1039
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,910
What's this?

1040
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,610
Oh my, what now?

1041
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,050
The children are asleep.

1042
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,190
But look, there's nothing underneath.

1043
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:04,750
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them or ensnare them.

1044
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:09,770
Only little cozy things secure inside their dreamland.

1045
01:03:12,550 --> 01:03:13,290
What's this?

1046
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:14,310
I was early!

1047
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:18,750
The monsters are all missing and the nightmares can't be found.

1048
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:21,710
And in their place, there seems to be good feeling all around.

1049
01:03:21,970 --> 01:03:24,690
Instead of screams, I swear I can hear music in the air.

1050
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:28,910
The smell of cakes and toys are absolutely everywhere.

1051
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:33,310
The sights, the sounds, they're everywhere and all around.

1052
01:03:33,970 --> 01:03:35,850
I've never felt so good before.

1053
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,330
This empty place inside of me is filling up.

1054
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:39,710
I simply cannot get enough.

1055
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:40,490
I want it.

1056
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:41,210
Oh, I want it.

1057
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:42,610
Oh, I want it for my own.

1058
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:43,510
I got to know it.

1059
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,210
I got to know it.

1060
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:45,670
It's this place that I have found.

1061
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,210
What is this?

1062
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:53,310
Christmas Town?

1063
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:02,790
I sound like...I became an eagle for a second.

1064
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:06,150
I became an eagle for a second.

1065
01:04:08,370 --> 01:04:09,210
What is this?

1066
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:15,950
Need a song or two is what they said.

1067
01:04:16,130 --> 01:04:16,890
Another song!

1068
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:17,910
Another song!

1069
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:27,210
I like this one too.

1070
01:04:30,650 --> 01:04:33,370
Of course I'm not going to stop after the merch though.

1071
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:35,510
I'm going to sing a lot of songs.

1072
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:36,170
No worries.

1073
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:46,120
Actually, do I remember how this goes?

1074
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:48,900
I think so.

1075
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,640
Kidnap Mr. Sandy Claws.

1076
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,160
I want to do it.

1077
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,260
Let's draw straws.

1078
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:58,500
Jack said we should work together.

1079
01:04:58,640 --> 01:04:59,440
Three of a kind.

1080
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:00,240
Birds of a feather.

1081
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:01,080
Now and forever.

1082
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,020
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1083
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,420
Lock him up real tight.

1084
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,940
Throw away the key and then turn off all the lights.

1085
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:18,580
First we're gonna set some bait inside a nasty trap and wait.

1086
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,060
When he comes a-sniffing we will snap the trap and close the gate.

1087
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,460
Wait, I've got a better plan to catch this big red lobster man.

1088
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,860
Let's pop him in a boiling pot and when he's done we'll butter him up.

1089
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,880
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1090
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:32,400
Throw him in a box.

1091
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:35,920
Bury him for 90 years then see if he talks.

1092
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,780
Oh, then who's your oogie boogie man?

1093
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:43,160
Can take the whole thing over then.

1094
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,620
He'll be so pleased I do declare.

1095
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,680
That he will cook him rare.

1096
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:49,940
Woo!

1097
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,120
Kidnap.

1098
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,500
Kidnapping is very Christmas.

1099
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:01,500
We take a can and aim it at his door and then not three times.

1100
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,100
And when he answers, Sandy Claws will be no more.

1101
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:04,920
You're so stupid.

1102
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,940
Think now if we blow him up to smithereens.

1103
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,040
We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.

1104
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,840
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1105
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,340
Tie him in a bag.

1106
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,720
Throw him in the ocean then see if he is sad.

1107
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,100
Because Mr. Oogie Boogie is the meanest guy around.

1108
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,800
If I were on his boogie list, I'd get out of town.

1109
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:30,300
He'll be so pleased by our success.

1110
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,660
That he'll reward us too I bet.

1111
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:37,300
Perhaps he'll make his special brew.

1112
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:40,500
A snake and spider stew.

1113
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,840
We're little henchmen and we take our job with pride.

1114
01:06:44,080 --> 01:06:47,380
We do our best to please him and stay on his good side.

1115
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,420
I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.

1116
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,380
I'm not the dumb one.

1117
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,060
You're no fun.

1118
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:51,640
Shut up.

1119
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,080
Make me.

1120
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,000
I've got something.

1121
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:53,660
Listen now.

1122
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,440
This one is real good you'll see.

1123
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,260
We'll send a present to his door.

1124
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:58,800
Upon there'll be a notary.

1125
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:05,220
Now in the box we'll wait and hide until his curiosity incises him to look inside and then we'll have him.

1126
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:05,960
One, two, three.

1127
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,720
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1128
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,320
Beat him with a stick.

1129
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,300
Lock him up for 90 years.

1130
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,780
See what makes him tick.

1131
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:14,780
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1132
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,300
Choke him into bits.

1133
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,780
Mr. Oogie Boogie is sure to get his kicks.

1134
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:21,720
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1135
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,200
See what we will see.

1136
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,480
Lock him in a cage and then throw away the way the key.

1137
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,750
That was fun.

1138
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,530
I want to kidnap Santa Claus now.

1139
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:39,870
I mean, sorry, the Sandy Claws.

1140
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:42,530
Legally distinct Santa Claus.

1141
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:47,690
Kidnap the Sandy Claws.

1142
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,290
She's arguing with herself.

1143
01:07:53,130 --> 01:08:01,030
I literally stopped taking my meds for that song.

1144
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:04,310
I wasn't arguing with myself.

1145
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:10,590
Legally distinct Santa Claus.

1146
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:12,150
Sandy Claws.

1147
01:08:13,630 --> 01:08:17,190
Good, good.

1148
01:08:20,950 --> 01:08:21,550
Oh, sorry.

1149
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,470
Let me put the notice above.

1150
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,270
There we go.

1151
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,270
Thank you.

1152
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,930
Silent night or silver bells.

1153
01:08:29,090 --> 01:08:30,730
Yeah, I can do those.

1154
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:34,790
Let's see.

1155
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:38,390
Silent night or silver bells.

1156
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:39,870
Silver bells.

1157
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:44,050
Is that all they do is silver bells?

1158
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:54,530
That's all it does, right?

1159
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:56,630
The site isn't working.

1160
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:57,850
I know they are working on it.

1161
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:58,550
I'm so sorry.

1162
01:08:59,670 --> 01:09:00,290
I'm so sorry.

1163
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,910
I'm so sorry.

1164
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:03,890
Shadow Claws, X for the 5 gifted.

1165
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:08,350
White Christmas.

1166
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:09,130
I can do that one too.

1167
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:11,330
Let me make a net list.

1168
01:09:11,550 --> 01:09:12,170
Snow Halation.

1169
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:14,230
White Christmas.

1170
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:16,830
Silver bells, maybe.

1171
01:09:17,710 --> 01:09:18,350
All I want for Christmas.

1172
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:22,290
All I want for Christmas.

1173
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:23,490
Though I was going to do that one anyway.

1174
01:09:24,170 --> 01:09:25,170
Last Christmas, right?

1175
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,130
Last Christmas.

1176
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,310
It didn't give me something.

1177
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,550
It didn't give me an error though.

1178
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:48,070
It's empty I think for now.

1179
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:48,950
I think they are working on it.

1180
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:50,230
They are working on it guys.

1181
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:51,410
They are working on it.

1182
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:52,010
I'm so sorry.

1183
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:53,110
I'm sorry.

1184
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:55,230
It looks different.

1185
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:56,890
You can see some of the stuff.

1186
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,010
I think maybe.

1187
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:00,990
Maybe.

1188
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,670
I like how it says Birch countdown timer for me.

1189
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:07,730
OK.

1190
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:10,350
Sorry guys.

1191
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:11,630
Sorry guys.

1192
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:21,780
While you guys...

1193
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:26,480
While you guys refresh I'll sing another song for you.

1194
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:26,680
Here.

1195
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,820
I'll sing something to...

1196
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:30,320
Let's do... What was it?

1197
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:30,820
Silver bells?

1198
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:31,660
Or wait.

1199
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:33,380
Silent Night.

1200
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:36,580
We can do that one.

1201
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,260
I can try my best.

1202
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:04,810
All is calm, all is bright.

1203
01:11:05,190 --> 01:11:10,630
Round yon Virgin, Mother and Child.

1204
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:16,590
Holy infant so tender and mild.

1205
01:11:17,050 --> 01:11:22,710
Sleep in heavenly peace.

1206
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:27,830
Sleep in heavenly peace.

1207
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:34,750
Silent night, holy night.

1208
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:40,750
Shepherds quake at the sight.

1209
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:46,210
Glories stream from heaven afar.

1210
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:52,330
Heavenly hosts sing alleluia.

1211
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:57,590
Christ the Savior is born.

1212
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:03,550
Christ the Savior is born.

1213
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:10,770
Silent night, holy night.

1214
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:16,790
Son of God, love's pure light.

1215
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:22,750
Radiant beams from thy holy face.

1216
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:28,650
With dawn of redeeming grace.

1217
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:32,530
Jesus Lord at thy birth...

1218
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:34,350
The timing got weird.

1219
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:37,550
The timing got weird.

1220
01:12:37,730 --> 01:12:37,830
Sorry.

1221
01:12:37,910 --> 01:12:39,210
Why is it so fast?

1222
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:43,590
They were like rushing me through the song.

1223
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:45,510
They were like hurry it up kid.

1224
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:48,190
We got to get to all the old people here.

1225
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:49,210
Keep it up.

1226
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:50,030
Silent night.

1227
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:50,970
Hurry night.

1228
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,510
What is this tempo?

1229
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,670
Why was it so fast?

1230
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,390
Wrap it up.

1231
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,490
Wrap it up.

1232
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:17,630
Sorry everybody if the site is still being weird.

1233
01:13:18,370 --> 01:13:19,790
They are working on it.

1234
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:20,730
I promise.

1235
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,350
Is this song a memory of the crashed website?

1236
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:25,690
I don't know.

1237
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:27,110
Stop telling me how many people are here.

1238
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:27,670
I don't know.

1239
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,070
I don't look at that.

1240
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,950
Let's do another one.

1241
01:13:31,290 --> 01:13:31,770
What was it?

1242
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:32,550
Silver Bells, right?

1243
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,100
Wish I could watch.

1244
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:38,780
I need to play Project Wingman.

1245
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:44,050
Have fun with it.

1246
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:50,810
Wish I could watch, but I must play Project Wingman.

1247
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:54,550
Haven't felt the Christmas spirit in over 10 years.

1248
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:56,210
Maybe your wonderful singing and vibes.

1249
01:13:56,810 --> 01:13:59,810
We are Christmasing it up today.

1250
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:01,190
No worries.

1251
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:03,570
Del, thank you for the 20 gifted.

1252
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:08,050
Honestly kind of amazed.

1253
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:10,230
So funny.

1254
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:14,150
So funny.

1255
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:23,200
OK, let me do this one.

1256
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:31,250
I think I know this one well enough maybe.

1257
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,410
Actually I don't think I know it well enough actually, but that's OK.

1258
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,200
I'll give it to someone special.

1259
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:21,060
Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

1260
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:29,120
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1261
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:40,870
I don't know the Brain Romp versions of all the songs, but if I sing Brain Romp Monster Mash, I'm in the run.

1262
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:44,650
But if you guys sing a Brain Romp version, you guys are mine.

1263
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,250
This is double standards.

1264
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:52,280
Once bitten and twice shy.

1265
01:15:53,220 --> 01:15:57,740
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye.

1266
01:15:57,740 --> 01:16:01,600
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?

1267
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,740
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me.

1268
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,840
Oh my god, I wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying I love you.

1269
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:15,000
I meant it.

1270
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:18,740
Now I know what a fool I've been.

1271
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,880
But if you kiss me now, I know you'll fool me again.

1272
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:31,860
Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

1273
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:40,260
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1274
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:49,740
Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

1275
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:58,080
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1276
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,400
Friends

1277
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:26,580
with tired eyes and your soul of ice.

1278
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:30,460
My god, I thought you were someone to rely on.

1279
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,880
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.

1280
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,960
Face of a lover with a fire in his heart.

1281
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:44,500
A man undercover, but you tore me apart.

1282
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:52,300
Oh, now I found a real love and you'll never fool me again.

1283
01:17:53,120 --> 01:18:01,000
Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

1284
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:09,240
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1285
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:19,880
Last Christmas I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away.

1286
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:27,120
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special.

1287
01:18:28,460 --> 01:18:32,300
Face of a lover with a fire in his heart.

1288
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,680
A man undercover, but you tore me apart.

1289
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,880
Next year.

1290
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:43,800
I'll give it to someone.

1291
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,940
I'll give it to someone special.

1292
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:48,720
Special.

1293
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:52,060
Someone.

1294
01:19:07,340 --> 01:19:08,960
OK, I'm over it.

1295
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:14,700
I'm over it now.

1296
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:21,280
F5.

1297
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:22,920
Oh, David!

1298
01:19:24,700 --> 01:19:26,140
Thank you for the Akasupa.

1299
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,540
He got onto the bed and wrenched open the lattice, bursting as he pulled... What is this?

1300
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:35,380
What is this?

1301
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,020
What is this, David?

1302
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,060
I'm scared.

1303
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:38,740
What am I reading?

1304
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,380
What am I reading?

1305
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:50,000
What am I reading?

1306
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:53,880
Is the store up?

1307
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:59,720
The link still shows me not things on the page.

1308
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,780
I'm so sorry, you guys, for the trouble.

1309
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,540
I'm so sorry.

1310
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,320
I'm sorry for the trouble.

1311
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,300
I'm sorry for the trouble.

1312
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:20,920
The docusite is working.

1313
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:21,800
Oh, good!

1314
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,060
If you want to get that.

1315
01:20:25,340 --> 01:20:26,380
You don't have to, obviously.

1316
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,580
Yubi yubi, welcome to membership.

1317
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:31,240
Thank you!

1318
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:35,040
Let's keep singing songs.

1319
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:35,500
That's...

1320
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,860
That's from last Christmas.

1321
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:48,280
Wait, what did I sing after Sandy Claus?

1322
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:49,900
Shoot, I keep forgetting.

1323
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:51,040
I sing...

1324
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:52,320
Um...

1325
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:06,810
Silent Night.

1326
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:07,410
Oh, thank you!

1327
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:14,310
Silent Night and then 12 was last Christmas.

1328
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,530
OK, let's do another Christmas.

1329
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:25,980
What's the docu link?

1330
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,480
Oh, let me ask for it.

1331
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:35,540
Let me see, let me see.

1332
01:21:57,200 --> 01:21:58,780
Waiting for them to send it to me.

1333
01:21:58,860 --> 01:21:59,920
OK, I'm going to sing while I wait.

1334
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,280
But the docus are not limited or anything, so don't worry.

1335
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:07,380
What's this one?

1336
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:10,440
Oh wait, there's also this song.

1337
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:14,360
I'll do this one.

1338
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,400
Oh wait, OK.

1339
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:17,400
I'll do it after.

1340
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:23,740
Sorry guys, sorry.

1341
01:22:52,840 --> 01:23:15,080
I used to know where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow.

1342
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:37,080
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write.

1343
01:23:38,080 --> 01:24:00,300
May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white.

1344
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:18,300
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know.

1345
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:37,340
Where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow.

1346
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:57,480
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write.

1347
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,200
I don't think I like this song.

1348
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,180
Sorry.

1349
01:25:01,740 --> 01:25:04,020
I was thinking of a different song.

1350
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:09,680
I was thinking of the roasted chestnuts.

1351
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:23,340
And may all your Christmases be white.

1352
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:26,280
I was thinking of the chestnuts.

1353
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,500
I'm so sorry.

1354
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,080
I'm sorry for being so unserious.

1355
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,740
I got like bored of it in the middle.

1356
01:25:42,780 --> 01:25:45,160
Because I'm so concerned about the website.

1357
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:56,740
I'm like, ah, because so many people are freaking out about it in the chat and making it hard for me to be like, oh yeah.

1358
01:25:57,860 --> 01:25:59,920
And I'm like, oh no.

1359
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,740
That's why it's hard for me to focus.

1360
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:17,050
It'll get fixed.

1361
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:17,050
It'll get fixed.

1362
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:18,430
Hopefully.

1363
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:21,310
I mean it will, but you know.

1364
01:26:22,690 --> 01:26:25,110
Will this cover Santa Tell Me by Ariana Grande?

1365
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:25,970
I don't know.

1366
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:29,370
I could try Wabai, but I don't know it so much.

1367
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:30,290
I just know that...

1368
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:48,050
Another rest.

1369
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,140
Okay, let me do chestnuts now.

1370
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:08,200
Oh wait, there's a Celine Dion version?

1371
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:10,800
Wait, is it Carpenters?

1372
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:11,740
No, right?

1373
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:12,660
No, I don't know actually.

1374
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:16,840
Where can I find merch?

1375
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:28,740
There's a link in the pin message, but maybe I'll just link this instead.

1376
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:30,400
Merch.

1377
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,320
Maybe I'll link that instead.

1378
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:38,260
Oh, there we go.

1379
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,100
Wait, hold on.

1380
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:41,600
Ah, wait.

1381
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:42,720
Merch.

1382
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:45,900
Doki.

1383
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,080
Thank you.

1384
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:49,640
Doki.

1385
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:51,220
There we go.

1386
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,300
Two different links.

1387
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,480
Replace.

1388
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:01,290
That should work.

1389
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,790
That should work.

1390
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:08,950
It doesn't have everything, but there's some stuff there at least.

1391
01:28:09,970 --> 01:28:13,170
But I want the main link to work because it has everything.

1392
01:28:13,950 --> 01:28:15,530
This doesn't have everything.

1393
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:20,150
Because it's missing the little blocks, but there's a plushie on there.

1394
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:26,350
Oh yeah, I forgot to say that the plushie comes with the keychain too.

1395
01:28:28,230 --> 01:28:30,470
The plushie comes with the keychain too.

1396
01:28:34,710 --> 01:28:35,190
ToraDora?

1397
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:36,050
Oh my gosh.

1398
01:28:36,470 --> 01:28:37,290
It's Christmas.

1399
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:42,330
I have to see if I can find that one.

1400
01:28:43,170 --> 01:28:44,590
Let me see if this is the version of the song.

1401
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:04,710
Wrong one.

1402
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:05,370
Okay, hold on.

1403
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:06,270
I'm going to try this one.

1404
01:29:06,710 --> 01:29:07,070
Wait.

1405
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:07,870
Oh wait.

1406
01:29:09,330 --> 01:29:10,610
Maybe it is the right one.

1407
01:29:10,730 --> 01:29:11,170
Hold on.

1408
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,590
Maybe I'm stupid.

1409
01:29:14,790 --> 01:29:15,650
I'll just do this one.

1410
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:22,010
Pumped up tiger.

1411
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:24,750
Thank you very much.

1412
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:47,460
Jack Frost nipping at your nose.

1413
01:29:48,820 --> 01:30:01,540
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos.

1414
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:20,360
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright.

1415
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:35,340
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight.

1416
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:43,860
They know that Santa's on his way.

1417
01:30:45,140 --> 01:30:51,640
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.

1418
01:30:52,640 --> 01:31:07,920
And every mother's child is going to spy to see if reindeer really know how to fly.

1419
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:24,720
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two.

1420
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:41,210
Oh, it's been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas to you.

1421
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:32,190
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two.

1422
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:49,750
Oh, it's been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas,

1423
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:55,440
Merry Christmas.

1424
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:18,530
Let me see.

1425
01:33:18,590 --> 01:33:20,870
I saw some people say the original link works now.

1426
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:21,690
Let me see.

1427
01:33:22,810 --> 01:33:24,610
No, I'm not seeing.

1428
01:33:26,710 --> 01:33:28,110
Still not seeing it.

1429
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:41,090
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire.

1430
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:48,730
Even if I can't get any merch, we get to spend time with you and that's worth eight minto plushies.

1431
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:49,050
Stop!

1432
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:51,690
What do you mean?

1433
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:58,110
Sorry, Pyra, I just saw your thing.

1434
01:33:58,410 --> 01:34:02,270
Yes, I have a concert coming up next weekend.

1435
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:05,310
Not this seventh weekend, but the fourteenth weekend.

1436
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:12,170
Live in Atlanta, Georgia with Doki at the Tabernacle in Atlanta, Georgia.

1437
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:13,590
I think I already said that.

1438
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:16,250
Yes, tickets are up.

1439
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:20,430
You can look up Phantom Thief concert and you'll see us.

1440
01:34:21,170 --> 01:34:29,650
We have other people such as Doobie as a special guest and Phoebe and Pia.

1441
01:34:33,650 --> 01:34:34,530
Junna.

1442
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:37,070
I'm missing one.

1443
01:34:38,950 --> 01:34:39,490
Right?

1444
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:42,050
Or was it the three of them?

1445
01:34:44,990 --> 01:34:46,270
Phoebe, Pia...

1446
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:50,740
Phoebe, Pia, Junna.

1447
01:34:54,700 --> 01:34:55,800
How about Doki?

1448
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:57,060
I said Doki earlier.

1449
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,740
I said me and Doki.

1450
01:35:01,140 --> 01:35:01,840
And Doobie.

1451
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:09,820
Pia, Phoebe, Junna, Doobie are special guests and it's me and Doki's concert.

1452
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,020
Yes, you forgot Mint.

1453
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:16,040
It's me, Drew and Minto.

1454
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:18,120
Hold on, my chat is broken again.

1455
01:35:20,100 --> 01:35:21,260
Everything is breaking.

1456
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,260
My computer is breaking.

1457
01:35:22,980 --> 01:35:25,000
My new monitors are breaking.

1458
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,220
The website is breaking.

1459
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:28,340
I'm stressed.

1460
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:29,280
I'm stressing.

1461
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:32,120
I'm stressing a little.

1462
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:34,600
Goodness.

1463
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:44,300
And I also have a goal of 300k by the end of this year.

1464
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,360
And I'm only 8k away.

1465
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:48,120
I say only as if that's not a lot.

1466
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:49,700
But I'm 8k away.

1467
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:52,540
And I have merchandise.

1468
01:35:53,360 --> 01:35:55,560
And I have too many things to talk about.

1469
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:59,260
I don't have enough brain cells.

1470
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:01,540
Oh gosh.

1471
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:05,880
I'm so excited for the merchandise.

1472
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:06,880
Thank you!

1473
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:11,580
My goal is 300k by the end of the year.

1474
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,560
So, we'll see.

1475
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:15,800
I'm 8k away.

1476
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,220
So hopefully, we'll see.

1477
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,080
I'll do my best.

1478
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,780
Shino, thanks for the 20 gifts!

1479
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:29,500
I'm checking the site one more time.

1480
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,440
Oh...

1481
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:33,800
Nope.

1482
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,500
OK, let's sing...

1483
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:43,500
Let's sing some anime songs.

1484
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:22,960
The color of this special season Makes my heart race

1485
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:42,680
Ever since we first met The melody of my heart I can't stop it, I can't stop it Why?

1486
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:52,280
Should I call out your name When I'm in pain?

1487
01:37:52,280 --> 01:38:17,820
Snow Halation Until our feelings overlap I can't wait It's frustrating, but I like it Even if I hesitate in the heat I can't help it I agree with the courage to jump in It's about to start

1488
01:38:33,100 --> 01:39:17,130
Fate changes quietly My heart beats faster For the future 例えば 恋は すぐ 駆けつけて 抱きしめたくて 何処にいても 何処でも fly high 急いで いつの間にか 大きくなりすぎた true emotion

1489
01:39:22,290 --> 01:39:41,530
夢だけ見てるようじゃ 辛いよ 恋人は 君でいたい 優しい目が 止まってる 嫌だよ このまま一気に愛情 預けて please

1490
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:22,720
Meet the flintstones, they're the modern stonage family From the town of bedrock, they're a page right out of history Someday maybe Fred will win the fight Then the cat will stay out for the night When you're with the flintstones Have a yabba dabba do time,

1491
01:40:22,820 --> 01:40:26,720
a dabba do time Do yabba dabba do.

1492
01:40:26,980 --> 01:40:29,280
Do yabba dabba dabba do.

1493
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:32,820
Yabba dabba dabba dabba do.

1494
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:36,740
We'll have a gay old time.

1495
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:04,140
Doing that part is way too much fun to not do it.

1496
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:07,220
Do yabba dabba do.

1497
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,420
Do yabba dabba dabba do.

1498
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:21,980
Let's see.

1499
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:27,540
What is that song called?

1500
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:30,720
What is that Toradora song called?

1501
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:35,640
Holy Night!

1502
01:41:35,820 --> 01:41:36,340
Thank you.

1503
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:39,800
I wonder if they have a karaoke Holy Night.

1504
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,100
Like on YouTube.

1505
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:42,660
Oh, wait.

1506
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:44,100
Maybe I should...

1507
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:51,940
This says karaoke, but I wonder.

1508
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:54,200
Let's see.

1509
01:41:54,240 --> 01:41:54,660
Hold on.

1510
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,680
I'm looking into the future.

1511
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:59,600
Now do the Flintstones version.

1512
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,360
Let me see.

1513
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:16,500
Oh, here.

1514
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,740
I just turned it off.

1515
01:42:17,800 --> 01:42:19,000
Let me try if this is...

1516
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:25,680
This is it?

1517
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,100
Holy Night!

1518
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,260
Maybe it's better if it sounds like a bad quality.

1519
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:39,180
Hopefully I don't get taken down for this.

1520
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,740
That's not it.

1521
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:14,890
I don't remember the... I think I remember the verses.

1522
01:43:40,290 --> 01:43:41,570
I don't remember.

1523
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:51,530
I'm sorry.

1524
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,830
Holy Night!

1525
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:17,890
This song makes me cry!

1526
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:21,630
I think of the time.

1527
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,690
Holy Night!

1528
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:08,290
Party Night!

1529
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:09,150
Christmas!

1530
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:27,330
I think of

1531
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:39,260
that scene where Taiga goes to her apartment and Ryuji is there dressed up as the bear.

1532
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:42,480
And she just gives him the big hug and then they spin around.

1533
01:45:46,100 --> 01:45:52,780
And then she cries, but then she runs after him, but he's gone.

1534
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,740
Do they kiss?

1535
01:45:56,820 --> 01:46:00,780
Not in that scene, but Toradora still has the greatest anime kiss scene ever.

1536
01:46:01,420 --> 01:46:01,940
Fight me.

1537
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:05,280
It's the greatest anime kiss ever, ever, ever.

1538
01:46:05,680 --> 01:46:06,560
It's so beautiful.

1539
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:07,360
It's so...

1540
01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,100
God!

1541
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,680
Oh my gosh.

1542
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:12,840
I love that.

1543
01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:14,040
I love the whole anime.

1544
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:23,520
I used to watch... I haven't in many, many years now, but I used to watch or re-watch Toradora during Christmas time just so I could re-watch the Christmas episode!

1545
01:46:25,340 --> 01:46:28,060
I sneaked in an order while everyone was clapping.

1546
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,600
Are the orders going through?

1547
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:30,960
Let's go!

1548
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,960
Oh my gosh.

1549
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:33,680
Wait!

1550
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:35,260
The main link works now!

1551
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:37,140
If you wanted to block me though.

1552
01:46:39,560 --> 01:46:40,680
Let me...merge.

1553
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:44,580
Doki...Doki site.

1554
01:46:45,020 --> 01:46:45,540
Wait, hold on.

1555
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:46,840
Let me grab the Doki site.

1556
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:56,170
OK, use this link instead so you can see everything.

1557
01:46:57,730 --> 01:46:58,290
Replace.

1558
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:00,670
Yay!

1559
01:47:00,670 --> 01:47:03,530
If you want to block.

1560
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:05,150
The mythical block.

1561
01:47:05,410 --> 01:47:06,890
Oh, I gotta do that too.

1562
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:10,590
And then it shows the other official...fan official items.

1563
01:47:13,710 --> 01:47:15,890
I defeated the website connection demons.

1564
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:16,250
Order.

1565
01:47:16,450 --> 01:47:16,590
Yay!

1566
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:25,060
OK.

1567
01:47:27,420 --> 01:47:28,900
The Booba mousepad is not accurate.

1568
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:30,080
It's also not mine.

1569
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:33,700
It's also not mine.

1570
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:36,080
It is fan merch.

1571
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,340
I think they also host fan merch on their site.

1572
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,020
So there's some stuff.

1573
01:47:41,120 --> 01:47:43,320
So basically how it works is...

1574
01:47:43,320 --> 01:47:50,000
The super cool exclusive items are the limited stuff that is...

1575
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,040
That is like...I've purchased that essentially.

1576
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:56,160
Like I pre-bought those with my own money.

1577
01:47:56,160 --> 01:48:03,060
And I get most of the stuff, most of the money from those.

1578
01:48:03,280 --> 01:48:13,060
And then the fan official items are items that with my approval and me and Moso working together...

1579
01:48:13,060 --> 01:48:17,680
We made those fan official items.

1580
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:19,440
So I still get a cut.

1581
01:48:21,700 --> 01:48:23,060
But like...yeah.

1582
01:48:26,540 --> 01:48:28,480
And yeah, the plush comes with the keychain.

1583
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,660
They told me that shipping should go out maybe around like...

1584
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:42,260
Depending on what you get, around mid to late January.

1585
01:48:44,120 --> 01:48:47,660
I was able to get my order through and it looks like it's working for other people as well.

1586
01:48:47,780 --> 01:48:47,960
Yay!

1587
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:49,580
I hope that takes a little bit off of your mind.

1588
01:48:49,660 --> 01:48:51,180
Thanks for putting me in the Christmas spirit today.

1589
01:48:51,500 --> 01:48:51,780
Yeah!

1590
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:56,730
Thank you guys.

1591
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:57,770
Thank you.

1592
01:48:58,330 --> 01:48:59,790
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1593
01:49:00,850 --> 01:49:02,570
Fighting for my order to go through.

1594
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:06,010
Before it crashed and it got fixed again.

1595
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:06,770
Yeah, it went through!

1596
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:07,530
Oh, yatta!

1597
01:49:09,490 --> 01:49:12,890
Thank you guys for getting the plushie and the box.

1598
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:14,230
I'm sorry for the troubles.

1599
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:17,210
It seems that things are going smooth, smooth.

1600
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:18,850
Oh, give this link.

1601
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:21,250
Yeah, I think that's the one I can put up.

1602
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:22,850
Let me make sure.

1603
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:25,250
Yay!

1604
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:33,730
Yippee!

1605
01:49:35,410 --> 01:49:36,810
Yippee, yippee, yippee!

1606
01:49:39,010 --> 01:49:39,670
Cool!

1607
01:49:40,350 --> 01:49:41,050
I'm happy.

1608
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:43,110
Let's see.

1609
01:49:43,230 --> 01:49:44,810
Oh, let me add to the setlist.

1610
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:46,250
Snow Halation and then...

1611
01:49:48,930 --> 01:49:53,230
Holy Night ToraDora insert song.

1612
01:49:55,130 --> 01:49:56,670
So people don't get confused.

1613
01:50:00,610 --> 01:50:02,850
Guys, is it okay if I don't sing some Christmas song?

1614
01:50:04,190 --> 01:50:07,250
I've been in a totally absolutely wicked mood recently.

1615
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:09,450
All I want to sing and listen to is wicked.

1616
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:15,950
It's kind of Christmas because it came out recently, right?

1617
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:22,570
I just want to sing Wicked the musical.

1618
01:50:23,210 --> 01:50:25,570
Wait, Wicked musical.

1619
01:50:30,750 --> 01:50:32,270
Please loathing?

1620
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:43,750
I can maybe do... I don't know who's part I sing usually.

1621
01:50:43,950 --> 01:50:44,690
Let's try it.

1622
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:47,530
Sorry, these are just... I just get these out of my system.

1623
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:48,230
I'm really sorry.

1624
01:51:00,580 --> 01:51:03,260
Oh my god.

1625
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,500
Wait, I need someone to sing with me.

1626
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:04,800
Elphaba.

1627
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,440
Blonde.

1628
01:51:44,300 --> 01:51:47,020
Curve it as a flame.

1629
01:51:47,640 --> 01:51:50,480
Does it have a name?

1630
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,540
Yes.

1631
01:51:58,360 --> 01:51:59,240
Loathing.

1632
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:00,920
Unadulterated loathing.

1633
01:52:01,620 --> 01:52:03,920
For your face, your voice, your clothing.

1634
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:07,820
Let's just say I loathe it all.

1635
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:14,700
Every little trait, however small, makes my very flesh begin to crawl.

1636
01:52:15,080 --> 01:52:19,840
With the utter loathing, there's a strange exhilaration.

1637
01:52:20,380 --> 01:52:26,220
In such total devastation, it's so pure, it's so strong.

1638
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:33,700
Though I do admit it came on fast, still I do believe that it can last.

1639
01:52:33,700 --> 01:52:41,660
And I will be loathing, loathing you my whole life long.

1640
01:52:41,800 --> 01:52:43,780
Dear Galinda, you are just too good.

1641
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,760
How do you stand it?

1642
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:47,000
I don't think I could.

1643
01:52:47,260 --> 01:52:50,240
She's a terror, she's a tartar, we don't mean to show a bite.

1644
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:51,280
This is me to Matara.

1645
01:52:53,640 --> 01:52:59,620
Well, these things are sent to try us.

1646
01:52:59,620 --> 01:53:05,240
Poor Galinda, forced to be side with someone so disgustigified.

1647
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:06,680
We just want to tell you...

1648
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:08,080
Everybody thinks she's disgusting!

1649
01:53:11,060 --> 01:53:12,300
We share your loathing.

1650
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:14,660
What is this feeling so sudden and new?

1651
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:17,760
I felt the moment I laid eyes on you.

1652
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:21,360
My pulse is rushing, my head is reeling.

1653
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:24,400
Oh, what is this feeling?

1654
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:28,780
Does it have a name?

1655
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:34,920
It's loathing.

1656
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:41,220
There's a strange exhilaration in such total distastation.

1657
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:45,800
It's so pure, it's so strong.

1658
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:51,920
Though I do admit it came on fast, still I do believe that it can last.

1659
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:56,060
And I will be loathing for forever.

1660
01:53:56,600 --> 01:54:02,500
Loathing truly, deeply, loathing you.

1661
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:06,300
My whole life long.

1662
01:54:37,940 --> 01:54:39,380
Loathing truly, deeply, loathing you.

1663
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:41,720
The plushie sold out?

1664
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:43,520
Wait, actually?

1665
01:54:48,560 --> 01:54:49,020
Actually?

1666
01:55:12,640 --> 01:55:13,840
It's not a large number.

1667
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:14,760
It is for me!

1668
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,760
Do you know how much that cost me out of my pocket?

1669
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:22,010
It's out of my pocket.

1670
01:55:23,130 --> 01:55:24,070
It was a lot of money.

1671
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:29,610
I couldn't order anymore.

1672
01:55:30,770 --> 01:55:30,910
It's

1673
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:39,400
like the longest intro ever.

1674
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:49,440
Good news.

1675
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,760
She's dead.

1676
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:56,340
The western, the west is dead.

1677
01:55:56,900 --> 01:55:59,120
The wickedest witch there ever was.

1678
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:02,260
The enemy of all of us here in Oz is dead.

1679
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,200
Good news.

1680
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,740
I'll try and restock them someday.

1681
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:15,020
Look!

1682
01:56:15,340 --> 01:56:16,160
It's Glinda!

1683
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,400
Fellow Ozians.

1684
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:24,840
Let us be glad.

1685
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:27,920
Let us be grateful.

1686
01:56:29,020 --> 01:56:38,480
Let us rejoiceify that goodness could subdue the wicked workings of you-know.

1687
01:56:42,020 --> 01:56:49,640
Isn't it nice to know that good will conquer evil.

1688
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,700
The truth will all believe.

1689
01:56:54,520 --> 01:57:07,670
I am born only for you.

1690
01:57:09,870 --> 01:57:11,410
No one mourns the wicked.

1691
01:57:12,570 --> 01:57:15,370
No one cries they won't return.

1692
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:20,330
No one lays a lily on their grave.

1693
01:57:20,390 --> 01:57:22,490
A good man scorns the wicked.

1694
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:30,370
In their lives our children learn what we miss when we misbehave.

1695
01:57:31,990 --> 01:57:37,670
And goodness knows the wicked's lives are lonely.

1696
01:57:38,670 --> 01:57:45,150
Goodness knows the wicked die alone.

1697
01:57:45,570 --> 01:57:53,710
It just shows when you're wicked you're left only on your own.

1698
01:57:56,110 --> 01:58:00,650
Goodness knows the wicked's lives are lonely.

1699
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:07,410
Goodness knows the wicked cry alone.

1700
01:58:08,630 --> 01:58:11,270
Nothing grows for the wicked.

1701
01:58:11,870 --> 01:58:16,250
They reap only what they sow.

1702
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,550
Are people born wicked?

1703
01:58:21,330 --> 01:58:23,670
Or do they have wickedness thrust upon them?

1704
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:25,910
After all, she had a father.

1705
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:27,290
She had a mother.

1706
01:58:28,010 --> 01:58:29,530
As so many do.

1707
01:58:29,530 --> 01:58:33,370
How I hate to go and leave you lonely.

1708
01:58:34,090 --> 01:58:37,350
It's alright, it's only just one night.

1709
01:58:37,430 --> 01:58:38,390
I forgot about this part.

1710
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:44,970
But know that you're here in my heart, your soul.

1711
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:54,450
And, like every family, they had their secrets.

1712
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:58,590
Have another drink, my dark-eyed beauty.

1713
01:58:58,590 --> 01:59:01,710
I've got one more night left here in town.

1714
01:59:01,830 --> 01:59:04,950
So have another drink, a green elixir.

1715
01:59:05,090 --> 01:59:07,810
And we'll have ourselves a little mixer.

1716
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:13,490
Have another little swallow, little lady, and follow me now.

1717
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:20,490
And of course, from the moment she was born, she was...

1718
01:59:21,230 --> 01:59:21,830
well...

1719
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:22,330
different.

1720
01:59:23,530 --> 01:59:24,650
I thought this was a separate song.

1721
01:59:24,890 --> 01:59:25,710
I know.

1722
01:59:25,990 --> 01:59:26,730
The baby's coming!

1723
01:59:26,730 --> 01:59:28,150
I see a nose!

1724
01:59:28,350 --> 01:59:28,750
Oh god!

1725
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:30,230
I'm birthing the baby!

1726
01:59:35,550 --> 01:59:36,690
What is it?

1727
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:37,930
What's wrong?

1728
01:59:39,030 --> 01:59:39,570
Could it be?

1729
01:59:39,690 --> 01:59:40,730
What does it mean?

1730
01:59:42,130 --> 01:59:43,490
It's atrocious!

1731
01:59:43,670 --> 01:59:45,610
It's obscene!

1732
01:59:47,210 --> 01:59:53,410
Like a froggy, ferny cabbage, the baby is unnaturally green!

1733
01:59:59,630 --> 02:00:00,650
And then he says something.

1734
02:00:00,730 --> 02:00:01,470
He's like, Go away!

1735
02:00:02,330 --> 02:00:02,930
Oh, there he goes.

1736
02:00:03,010 --> 02:00:03,590
He said it.

1737
02:00:04,530 --> 02:00:05,250
Take it away!

1738
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,710
Have you guys ever seen The Wicked?

1739
02:00:06,970 --> 02:00:09,070
So you see, it couldn't have been easy!

1740
02:00:18,190 --> 02:00:19,270
I don't remember this part.

1741
02:00:20,230 --> 02:00:21,150
I remember this part.

1742
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:31,610
We know what wickedness is!

1743
02:00:35,930 --> 02:00:38,130
She died alone!

1744
02:00:38,590 --> 02:00:40,890
Won't you know?

1745
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:44,310
Who's spurned what goodness is?

1746
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:46,850
They are shy!

1747
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:53,290
No one knows the wickedness!

1748
02:00:53,290 --> 02:00:55,250
No one knows!

1749
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:59,550
No one knows the wickedness!

1750
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:08,290
No one knows the wickedness!

1751
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:12,550
Wickedness!

1752
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:22,900
Oh, shit.

1753
02:01:23,620 --> 02:01:26,940
I can't hit high notes very easily anymore.

1754
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:33,200
I didn't...

1755
02:01:33,200 --> 02:01:33,860
It's...

1756
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,220
It's as long as your mind in the movie.

1757
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:38,620
Or is that in the second act?

1758
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,080
I can't remember.

1759
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:43,360
OK, let me do two more songs.

1760
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:43,800
I'm sorry.

1761
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:47,000
I'll do this one and I'll do Defying Gravity and all whatever.

1762
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:48,660
It's in the second act.

1763
02:01:48,820 --> 02:01:49,980
Oh, so you haven't heard it yet.

1764
02:01:50,300 --> 02:01:50,880
Oh, shoot.

1765
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:53,980
I like this song though.

1766
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:54,720
Wait.

1767
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:56,860
Fierro.

1768
02:01:57,660 --> 02:01:59,160
41 of Minto Plushie.

1769
02:01:59,740 --> 02:02:00,440
Wait, what?

1770
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:04,560
No!

1771
02:02:24,340 --> 02:02:26,580
I will try to do a pre-order, you guys!

1772
02:02:34,520 --> 02:02:36,500
Lying beside you.

1773
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,480
Hold on, wait a second.

1774
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:40,000
Oh, wait.

1775
02:02:40,520 --> 02:02:42,100
Want me to uncap the plushies?

1776
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:42,880
They're sold out.

1777
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:44,060
I can arrange more.

1778
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:44,520
Oh.

1779
02:02:49,590 --> 02:02:51,470
I think they're gonna try and put more up.

1780
02:02:55,340 --> 02:02:55,780
Maybe.

1781
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:04,660
I'm seeing if we can do pre-order or something.

1782
02:03:05,260 --> 02:03:05,920
For you guys.

1783
02:03:06,280 --> 02:03:06,600
Sorry.

1784
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:12,200
Sorry, that's what I was messaging back about.

1785
02:03:12,200 --> 02:03:12,960
Oh my gosh.

1786
02:03:13,360 --> 02:03:14,560
Okay, let me start over.

1787
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:59,650
Lying beside you.

1788
02:03:59,870 --> 02:04:03,250
With you wanting me.

1789
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:06,630
And just for this moment.

1790
02:04:07,210 --> 02:04:08,270
This is about the plushies.

1791
02:04:08,470 --> 02:04:11,970
As long as you're mine.

1792
02:04:12,410 --> 02:04:14,830
I've lost all resistance.

1793
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:20,650
Across some borderline.

1794
02:04:20,970 --> 02:04:24,070
And if it turns out.

1795
02:04:24,770 --> 02:04:29,490
It's over too fast.

1796
02:04:29,830 --> 02:04:35,490
I'll make every last moment last.

1797
02:04:37,030 --> 02:04:41,390
As long as you're mine.

1798
02:04:42,730 --> 02:04:44,250
I think there's more of you guys.

1799
02:04:44,410 --> 02:04:45,630
Check, check, check, check, check, check.

1800
02:04:48,630 --> 02:04:49,990
Check while this guy's singing.

1801
02:04:50,070 --> 02:04:50,970
We don't care about this guy.

1802
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:54,830
We don't care about him.

1803
02:05:01,090 --> 02:05:02,750
Check, check, check, check.

1804
02:05:04,730 --> 02:05:05,650
Man singing.

1805
02:05:06,030 --> 02:05:07,570
Get out of here.

1806
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:19,690
Every moment.

1807
02:05:20,990 --> 02:05:24,690
As long as you're mine.

1808
02:05:25,670 --> 02:05:28,050
I'll wake up my body.

1809
02:05:30,450 --> 02:05:33,690
And make up for lost time.

1810
02:05:41,770 --> 02:05:43,850
And though.

1811
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:46,130
I may know.

1812
02:05:46,130 --> 02:05:49,290
I don't care.

1813
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:52,890
Just for this moment.

1814
02:05:54,110 --> 02:05:58,130
As long as you're mine.

1815
02:05:58,510 --> 02:06:01,050
Cook me how you want to.

1816
02:06:03,350 --> 02:06:06,390
And see how bright we shine.

1817
02:06:06,850 --> 02:06:08,710
Borrow the moonlight.

1818
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:12,830
Until it is through.

1819
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:22,860
I'll be here.

1820
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,640
Holding you.

1821
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:33,920
As long as you're mine.

1822
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:44,160
What is it?

1823
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:49,100
Oh, it's just for the first time.

1824
02:06:50,140 --> 02:06:52,600
I feel wicked.

1825
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:53,440
I

1826
02:07:01,630 --> 02:07:03,610
think for the extra plushies that they're putting up.

1827
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:04,390
They're not like.

1828
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:06,670
They're, they're, they are.

1829
02:07:07,010 --> 02:07:08,510
Like, what's it called?

1830
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:11,650
Since I ordered a specific amount.

1831
02:07:12,010 --> 02:07:13,230
We will have to order more.

1832
02:07:13,470 --> 02:07:14,190
You know what I mean?

1833
02:07:14,310 --> 02:07:17,610
So, if you get one now.

1834
02:07:17,950 --> 02:07:19,510
It will be maybe a little bit.

1835
02:07:20,110 --> 02:07:21,790
Yeah, it's like a pre-order basically.

1836
02:07:24,950 --> 02:07:26,790
Yeah, it's basically like a pre-order.

1837
02:07:27,010 --> 02:07:29,270
So, I just have to make some more.

1838
02:07:29,670 --> 02:07:31,970
Well, I mean, it took me.

1839
02:07:32,170 --> 02:07:34,150
I was in the works for it like.

1840
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:40,450
For many months.

1841
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:42,830
It took a long, long time.

1842
02:07:43,190 --> 02:07:45,610
So, it shouldn't take as long.

1843
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:49,090
Because it's not like me going through a.

1844
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:50,010
What's the word?

1845
02:07:50,490 --> 02:07:52,470
Like a process of me being like.

1846
02:07:52,570 --> 02:07:53,630
Okay, getting the design.

1847
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:55,010
And then getting it shipped to me.

1848
02:07:55,050 --> 02:07:55,790
And then me checking.

1849
02:07:55,970 --> 02:07:58,010
And then me giving the okay.

1850
02:07:58,250 --> 02:07:59,150
And then this, that, that.

1851
02:07:59,150 --> 02:07:59,710
You know what I mean?

1852
02:07:59,750 --> 02:08:00,570
No design phase.

1853
02:08:00,650 --> 02:08:01,230
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1854
02:08:01,330 --> 02:08:08,150
So, hopefully, everybody gets them in a timely manner.

1855
02:08:09,570 --> 02:08:11,070
Should be at least a little bit faster.

1856
02:08:13,890 --> 02:08:15,370
Honestly, everything took so long.

1857
02:08:15,450 --> 02:08:16,250
Just because I was like.

1858
02:08:16,330 --> 02:08:17,290
I don't really have a storefront.

1859
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:19,470
And I don't really have a way to ship stuff out.

1860
02:08:21,510 --> 02:08:23,350
I've never had a storefront before.

1861
02:08:25,850 --> 02:08:26,830
I didn't know how.

1862
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:27,350
I was like.

1863
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,690
Oh, gosh.

1864
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:29,210
I'm going to be doing fulfillment for years.

1865
02:08:29,690 --> 02:08:29,930
And I.

1866
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:30,650
So, I was like.

1867
02:08:30,670 --> 02:08:31,430
Okay, I'll go with Moso.

1868
02:08:31,630 --> 02:08:32,450
Because I.

1869
02:08:33,290 --> 02:08:36,190
Well, also, the people helping my plushie.

1870
02:08:36,450 --> 02:08:37,230
Making my plushie.

1871
02:08:37,610 --> 02:08:38,270
Recommended them.

1872
02:08:38,670 --> 02:08:39,610
And then also, I was like.

1873
02:08:41,050 --> 02:08:41,450
Okay.

1874
02:08:41,930 --> 02:08:43,210
They just told me.

1875
02:08:43,290 --> 02:08:44,250
Aiming for June.

1876
02:08:44,530 --> 02:08:46,250
For the second round of the plushies.

1877
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:48,010
So, sorry.

1878
02:08:48,170 --> 02:08:49,210
It's going to take some time.

1879
02:08:52,990 --> 02:08:53,950
So, yeah.

1880
02:08:56,910 --> 02:08:58,810
But that's for the second batch.

1881
02:08:58,930 --> 02:09:00,250
For the people that just got theirs.

1882
02:09:00,530 --> 02:09:01,310
It's sooner.

1883
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:02,510
So, yeah.

1884
02:09:04,490 --> 02:09:06,910
That's for the first batch of the ones.

1885
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:10,810
Will be much sooner.

1886
02:09:11,170 --> 02:09:12,310
Like, next month-ish.

1887
02:09:12,490 --> 02:09:12,730
Probably.

1888
02:09:14,210 --> 02:09:15,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1889
02:09:15,550 --> 02:09:16,070
Sorry.

1890
02:09:16,490 --> 02:09:16,770
Sorry.

1891
02:09:18,630 --> 02:09:20,430
Is Dakimakura print on demand?

1892
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:22,210
Dakimakura is print on demand.

1893
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:24,710
But it is up for a limited amount of time.

1894
02:09:24,710 --> 02:09:26,650
Because it is Isekai Minto.

1895
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:30,270
Minto with...

1896
02:09:30,270 --> 02:09:31,110
From another world.

1897
02:09:32,870 --> 02:09:34,950
So, after this though.

1898
02:09:35,070 --> 02:09:36,410
You will not be able to get it again.

1899
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:38,410
It is up for a limited time.

1900
02:09:40,150 --> 02:09:41,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1901
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:47,010
Not to say that there won't be another Dakimakura in the future.

1902
02:09:47,150 --> 02:09:49,450
But it will be a little bit different.

1903
02:09:49,890 --> 02:09:50,650
So, yeah.

1904
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:53,050
What's the end date?

1905
02:09:53,050 --> 02:09:55,450
I believe it's the end of this month.

1906
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:58,110
Unfortunately, I don't have a direct...

1907
02:09:58,110 --> 02:09:59,770
I don't have an exact date right now.

1908
02:10:00,550 --> 02:10:01,550
Dayui is an amazing artist.

1909
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:02,090
I know!

1910
02:10:02,610 --> 02:10:05,990
I knew that I wanted to go with Dayui.

1911
02:10:06,630 --> 02:10:07,930
Love their art so much.

1912
02:10:11,190 --> 02:10:11,670
Okay.

1913
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:16,330
I guess maybe I'll end with one last song.

1914
02:10:19,490 --> 02:10:21,630
Of course, I must sing this Christmas song.

1915
02:10:23,150 --> 02:10:24,930
Not Isekai Minto Daki soon.

1916
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:25,930
I wanna say soon.

1917
02:10:32,660 --> 02:10:35,140
Let's do one more song.

1918
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,820
She is thought.

1919
02:10:39,940 --> 02:10:40,700
Oh, Defying Gravity.

1920
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:47,020
Defying Gravity.

1921
02:10:47,200 --> 02:10:47,760
Okay, hold on.

1922
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:48,240
Let me do it.

1923
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:50,800
I forgot that I was gonna sing that one too.

1924
02:10:53,060 --> 02:10:55,000
I forgot I was gonna sing Defying Gravity.

1925
02:10:59,260 --> 02:11:00,260
I will be...

1926
02:11:00,840 --> 02:11:01,700
I'll be...

1927
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:01,860
Oh.

1928
02:11:02,520 --> 02:11:02,780
Elphaba.

1929
02:11:03,260 --> 02:11:06,500
Why couldn't you have stayed calm for once instead of flying off the handle?

1930
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:08,280
I hope you're happy.

1931
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:10,220
I hope you're happy now.

1932
02:11:10,560 --> 02:11:13,360
I hope you're happy how you hurt your cause forever.

1933
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:14,840
I hope you think you're clever.

1934
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:16,500
I hope you're happy.

1935
02:11:16,820 --> 02:11:18,280
I hope you're happy too.

1936
02:11:18,660 --> 02:11:24,100
I hope you're proud how you worked through all of this submission to feed your own ambition.

1937
02:11:24,100 --> 02:11:37,240
So though I can't imagine how, I hope you're happy right now.

1938
02:11:37,420 --> 02:11:39,660
Elphie, listen to me.

1939
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:42,620
Just say you're sorry.

1940
02:11:44,080 --> 02:11:47,660
You can still be with the wizard.

1941
02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:52,460
What you worked and waited for.

1942
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:57,460
You can have all you ever wanted.

1943
02:11:58,840 --> 02:11:59,240
I know.

1944
02:12:00,280 --> 02:12:02,400
But I don't want it.

1945
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:04,040
This Elphaba's funny.

1946
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:11,800
I can't want it anymore.

1947
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:14,120
Alright, I'm gonna take over Elphaba for a second.

1948
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,320
I'm sorry.

1949
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:22,160
Something has changed within me.

1950
02:12:22,940 --> 02:12:25,940
Something is not the same.

1951
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:34,740
I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game.

1952
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:38,180
Too late for second guessing.

1953
02:12:39,300 --> 02:12:42,060
Too late to go back to sleep.

1954
02:12:43,060 --> 02:12:46,420
It's time to trust my instincts.

1955
02:12:46,840 --> 02:12:49,060
Close my eyes.

1956
02:12:50,720 --> 02:12:51,680
And leave.

1957
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:57,940
It's time to try defying gravity.

1958
02:12:58,780 --> 02:13:04,060
I think I'll try defying gravity.

1959
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:06,580
And you can't pull me down.

1960
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:09,580
I make you understand.

1961
02:13:09,900 --> 02:13:12,280
You're having delusions of grandeur.

1962
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:14,920
I'm through accepting limits.

1963
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:17,860
Cause someone says they're so.

1964
02:13:18,580 --> 02:13:20,940
Some things I cannot change.

1965
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:24,340
But till I try, I'll never know.

1966
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:28,400
Too long I've been afraid of losing love.

1967
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:30,520
I guess I've lost.

1968
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:36,660
Well, if that's love, it comes at much too high of a cost.

1969
02:13:37,160 --> 02:13:42,060
I'd sooner find defying gravity.

1970
02:13:42,920 --> 02:13:44,500
Kiss me goodbye.

1971
02:13:45,260 --> 02:13:48,020
I'm defying gravity.

1972
02:13:48,440 --> 02:13:52,040
And you can't pull me down.

1973
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:59,080
Glinda, let's hold space for the lyrics of this song.

1974
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,400
Together.

1975
02:14:02,160 --> 02:14:03,240
Unlimited.

1976
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:08,180
Together we're unlimited.

1977
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:14,440
Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever been.

1978
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:19,900
Glinda dreams the way we planned them.

1979
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:27,480
If we work in tandem, there's no fight we cannot win.

1980
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:34,940
Just you and I, defying gravity.

1981
02:14:35,720 --> 02:14:40,800
With you and I, defying gravity.

1982
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:44,420
They'll never bring us down.

1983
02:14:58,490 --> 02:15:01,230
Now that you're choosing this.

1984
02:15:01,430 --> 02:15:02,350
You too.

1985
02:15:03,570 --> 02:15:06,170
I hope it brings you bliss.

1986
02:15:06,430 --> 02:15:08,210
I really hope you get it.

1987
02:15:08,330 --> 02:15:11,510
And you don't live to regret it.

1988
02:15:11,670 --> 02:15:18,410
I hope you're happy in the end.

1989
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:27,390
I hope you're happy, my friend.

1990
02:15:33,970 --> 02:15:37,450
So if you care to find me.

1991
02:15:37,690 --> 02:15:40,310
Look to the western sky.

1992
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:43,130
As someone told me lately.

1993
02:15:43,650 --> 02:15:47,890
Everyone deserves the chance to fly.

1994
02:15:47,890 --> 02:15:50,530
And if I'm flying solo.

1995
02:15:51,050 --> 02:15:53,230
At least I'm flying free.

1996
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:55,910
To those who ground me.

1997
02:15:56,210 --> 02:15:59,010
Take a message back from me.

1998
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:05,210
Tell them how I am defying gravity.

1999
02:16:06,050 --> 02:16:08,230
I'm flying high.

2000
02:16:08,310 --> 02:16:10,750
I'm defying gravity.

2001
02:16:11,270 --> 02:16:15,630
And soon I'll match them in renown.

2002
02:16:15,630 --> 02:16:17,590
And nobody.

2003
02:16:18,270 --> 02:16:19,850
In all of us.

2004
02:16:20,110 --> 02:16:23,130
No wizard that there is or was.

2005
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:30,250
Is ever gonna bring me down.

2006
02:16:35,510 --> 02:16:39,610
Bring me down.

2007
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:45,010
Bring me down.

2008
02:16:50,910 --> 02:16:55,050
Damn, I can't hold those notes for shit.

2009
02:16:56,690 --> 02:16:57,610
I can't hold it.

2010
02:16:57,650 --> 02:16:58,550
It's because I'm hungry.

2011
02:16:59,210 --> 02:17:01,190
When I get hungry I get all shaky.

2012
02:17:01,890 --> 02:17:05,290
And then I get shaky and my voice gets weaky.

2013
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:07,310
Minky!

2014
02:17:08,690 --> 02:17:09,830
Go get food.

2015
02:17:09,890 --> 02:17:10,950
I have one last song.

2016
02:17:13,410 --> 02:17:14,390
That's what I was like.

2017
02:17:14,430 --> 02:17:15,270
I'm thinking of food.

2018
02:17:15,410 --> 02:17:16,490
I'm not thinking of singing anymore.

2019
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:17,590
I'm hungry.

2020
02:17:17,850 --> 02:17:18,190
Alrighty.

2021
02:17:18,570 --> 02:17:18,890
Minky!

2022
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:23,350
Let's sing the Christmas special, baby!

2023
02:17:23,850 --> 02:17:25,770
I think you guys like my outfit.

2024
02:17:25,930 --> 02:17:26,710
It's cute, right?

2025
02:17:28,990 --> 02:17:32,650
Hopefully this helps you get into the Christmas spirit a little bit more.

2026
02:17:37,310 --> 02:17:40,850
Don't want a lot for Christmas.

2027
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:45,490
There is just one thing I need.

2028
02:17:46,170 --> 02:17:49,030
I don't care about the presents.

2029
02:17:49,910 --> 02:17:52,690
Underneath the Christmas tree.

2030
02:17:53,270 --> 02:17:56,830
I just want you for my own.

2031
02:17:57,210 --> 02:18:01,450
More than you could ever know.

2032
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:06,150
Make my wish come true.

2033
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:18,950
All I want for Christmas is you.

2034
02:18:24,390 --> 02:18:28,560
Love for Christmas.

2035
02:18:28,940 --> 02:18:31,640
There is just one thing I need.

2036
02:18:31,640 --> 02:18:32,640
And I...

2037
02:18:38,570 --> 02:18:41,150
I don't need to hang my stocking.

2038
02:18:41,850 --> 02:18:43,750
There upon the fireplace.

2039
02:18:45,010 --> 02:18:47,790
Santa Claus won't make me happy.

2040
02:18:47,970 --> 02:18:50,790
With a toy on Christmas day.

2041
02:18:51,190 --> 02:18:54,030
I just want you for my own.

2042
02:18:54,630 --> 02:18:57,010
More than you could ever know.

2043
02:18:57,730 --> 02:18:59,790
Make my wish come true.

2044
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:04,930
All I want for Christmas is you.

2045
02:19:08,010 --> 02:19:09,690
You, baby.

2046
02:19:10,490 --> 02:19:13,310
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas.

2047
02:19:13,790 --> 02:19:16,550
I won't even wish for snow.

2048
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:19,710
I'm just gonna keep on waiting.

2049
02:19:20,470 --> 02:19:21,750
Underneath the...

2050
02:19:22,550 --> 02:19:24,130
Merry Cootie, Merry Cootie.

2051
02:19:24,290 --> 02:19:25,750
I love that because...

2052
02:19:26,510 --> 02:19:29,630
For the plant North Pole for St. Nick.

2053
02:19:29,770 --> 02:19:32,890
I won't even stay awake to...

2054
02:19:32,890 --> 02:19:35,690
Hear those magic reindeers click.

2055
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:39,010
Cause I just want you here tonight.

2056
02:19:39,210 --> 02:19:41,970
Holding on to me so tight.

2057
02:19:42,450 --> 02:19:44,570
What more can I do?

2058
02:19:45,510 --> 02:19:50,070
All I want for Christmas is you.

2059
02:19:52,630 --> 02:19:54,470
You, baby.

2060
02:19:55,130 --> 02:20:00,190
All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere.

2061
02:20:02,210 --> 02:20:07,190
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air.

2062
02:20:08,290 --> 02:20:10,830
And everyone is singing.

2063
02:20:11,610 --> 02:20:14,050
I hear those sleigh bells ringing.

2064
02:20:14,490 --> 02:20:17,110
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?

2065
02:20:17,290 --> 02:20:19,450
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

2066
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:20,230
Yeah, yeah.

2067
02:20:20,430 --> 02:20:23,590
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas.

2068
02:20:23,970 --> 02:20:26,330
This is all I'm asking for.

2069
02:20:27,330 --> 02:20:33,210
I just want to see my baby standing right outside my door.

2070
02:20:33,350 --> 02:20:36,490
Oh, I just want you for my own.

2071
02:20:36,650 --> 02:20:39,570
More than you could ever know.

2072
02:20:39,970 --> 02:20:42,110
Make my wish come true.

2073
02:20:43,190 --> 02:20:50,370
All I want for Christmas is you.

2074
02:20:51,370 --> 02:20:52,490
All

2075
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:01,170
I want for Christmas is you, baby.

2076
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,760
You.

2077
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:14,360
All I want for Christmas is you, baby.

2078
02:21:15,060 --> 02:21:20,700
All I want for Christmas is you, baby.

2079
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:25,080
Merry Christmas!

2080
02:21:30,440 --> 02:21:32,060
Is you.

2081
02:21:35,310 --> 02:21:37,350
Thank you guys for the merch.

2082
02:21:37,850 --> 02:21:40,170
I've been selling out the merch.

2083
02:21:41,010 --> 02:21:42,590
I saw the Outsiders musical.

2084
02:21:44,410 --> 02:21:46,530
Yes, that's why I love the Outsiders so much.

2085
02:21:46,810 --> 02:21:48,030
Gosh, I think I'm not okay.

2086
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:50,090
I love Doomdiowee and Doomdeary too much.

2087
02:21:51,410 --> 02:21:52,070
Knocked it out of the park.

2088
02:21:52,150 --> 02:21:52,750
Thank you, Valentine,

2089
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:00,800
with it.

2090
02:22:01,240 --> 02:22:03,900
I can't wait to see all the pictures of the Minto to go.

2091
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:08,420
I can't wait to see everybody taking pictures with their Minto plushies and other merch.

2092
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:15,120
The little blocks and the keychains and the diorama and the stickers and everything.

2093
02:22:15,380 --> 02:22:15,740
Yeah!

2094
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:17,160
Thank you guys!

2095
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:19,700
Merch site shenanigans.

2096
02:22:19,780 --> 02:22:23,220
Sorry, I'm really still... I'm shaking because I was so nervous.

2097
02:22:23,340 --> 02:22:27,160
I got so hyped up and then I also... I'm hungry.

2098
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:30,380
Congratulations on being able to have such a huge merch drop.

2099
02:22:30,520 --> 02:22:31,880
Thank you guys!

2100
02:22:32,400 --> 02:22:33,760
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2101
02:22:33,920 --> 02:22:35,480
I really, really appreciate it.

2102
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:36,820
I appreciate you guys.

2103
02:22:36,820 --> 02:22:39,600
I'm... sorry.

2104
02:22:40,140 --> 02:22:40,860
Selling out.

2105
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:46,980
I'm going to go eat now so I can stop hyperventilating.

2106
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:48,820
Otsu Minto!

2107
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:49,840
Thank you everybody!

2108
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:51,420
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

2109
02:22:52,520 --> 02:22:53,420
Have a good night!

2110
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,060
I need some water.

2111
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:00,960
Have a good day!

2112
02:23:01,160 --> 02:23:02,540
Merikuri, Merikuri.

2113
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:04,100
Presento, presento.

2114
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:07,360
Bye bye!

2115
02:23:07,440 --> 02:23:09,100
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye!
