1
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,500
Hello.

2
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,160
Welcome back.

3
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,460
Hello everybody.

4
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,160
Oh god.

5
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,620
I took a couple days off.

6
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,180
I think I had too much fun.

7
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,020
My voice sounds a little funky now.

8
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,480
Sorry.

9
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,860
I sound sick, but I'm not.

10
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,320
Maybe I am.

11
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,480
My nose is a little runny.

12
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,100
Your voice bork.

13
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:13,480
No!

14
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,320
I'm okay.

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,320
Just sick in the head.

16
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,120
So true.

17
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm sick in the head, but I don't want to get better.

18
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,480
Have a fun weekend?

19
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,560
I did!

20
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,460
I had so much fun.

21
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,240
I got to hang out with some friends.

22
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,160
Chucky from Rugrats.

23
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,060
A baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.

24
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
I'm just roleplaying as a sailor.

25
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,460
This is my sailor voice.

26
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,460
Thank you for the super chat.

27
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,880
Welcome back to Dredge.

28
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
It's been a minute since I've played.

29
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,320
I'll be honest, I can't stop thinking about it.

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,220
I sound like a grandma.

31
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,240
A grandma?

32
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,580
I don't sound like a grandma.

33
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,420
Do I?

34
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,380
No.

35
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,980
Go fish.

36
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,600
You made me play this game as well and now I almost completed the game?

37
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,600
You're further than me then.

38
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,140
Sheesh.

39
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,280
I gotta step up my game, huh?

40
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,040
Not really.

41
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't sound like a grandma.

42
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,240
It's been a minute since I've last played this game.

43
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,520
Where's the hat?

44
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,500
Okay, fine.

45
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,580
I'll put on a hat.

46
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,200
I always think it's too big though.

47
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,680
You don't think it covers up the game too much?

48
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,080
Hat.

49
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,740
A fishing hat.

50
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,440
Oh my god, it's huge.

51
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,840
I'll make it a little bit smaller.

52
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,550
Bigger?

53
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,110
How's this?

54
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,690
I keep reading beasts as breasts.

55
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,190
As I walk, no breasts dare make a sound.

56
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,410
Perfect?

57
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:46,250
Okay, cool.

58
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,910
Oh my gosh, I'm a new PNG Vtuber, everybody.

59
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:52,790
Hello.

60
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,390
My name is Women Earth.

61
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,790
Because that woman is what makes the earth go round, baby.

62
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,490
I got big breasts.

63
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,530
Probably.

64
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,130
Woman Earth.

65
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,130
What if I kept it like this?

66
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,350
This actually kind of works.

67
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,690
There's a song about that.

68
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,110
Oh baby, do you know?

69
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,870
That's right.

70
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,290
All women make the earth go round.

71
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:41,050
Oh baby, yeah.

72
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,390
Wait, what is that song?

73
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,870
Close enough?

74
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,170
Okay.

75
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,750
We got it.

76
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,650
I was on the right path though, no?

77
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,830
We're back to Spongebob Squarepants hat.

78
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,050
Heaven is a place on earth.

79
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,350
Because women exist there.

80
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,290
Then, heaven is everywhere.

81
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:16,150
Baby, women fear me.

82
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,970
Fish fear me and men turn their eyes.

83
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:24,610
Ooh.

84
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,290
Get one, Minto Patty.

85
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,010
Wait, hold on.

86
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,550
I'm going to try a Spongebob laugh.

87
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,490
Don't laugh at me though.

88
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,090
If I get it wrong.

89
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,220
I sound like I'm glitching.

90
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,420
Hi Eepy and Minky.

91
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,220
Wait, why did I not hear a sound?

92
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,780
I just got back home from my trip and also Eepy finally got to see my Minto plushies.

93
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,500
Hope your voice gets better.

94
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,460
Yeah, it'll be fine in a couple days probably.

95
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,980
Nice sheep impression.

96
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,080
Okay,

97
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,280
can we start the game?

98
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Put the prize in the bag.

99
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,020
Coming right up.

100
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,140
Because you know that's how he does the laugh, no?

101
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,500
He like punches his throat.

102
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,480
I'm like getting choked out over here by myself.

103
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,800
Anyway, continue the game.

104
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,620
Have you never seen a video of Tom Ken-me?

105
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,400
And he does the laugh.

106
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,580
Oostie!

107
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,600
Oh my gosh!

108
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,860
You said and then you so fast got a new job.

109
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,620
Congrats!

110
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,460
Also thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

111
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,920
See?

112
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,420
There was nothing to be worried about.

113
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,640
Congrats!

114
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,140
So happy.

115
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,180
What was we doing last time?

116
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,060
Oh golly, it's been so long.

117
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,220
We have the factory.

118
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,100
Can you believe the size of that squid?

119
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,860
It's shaking the whole damn rig.

120
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
Doesn't seem like it should be possible.

121
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,960
The legs are anchored pretty deep.

122
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,920
Saw you on Business Insider.

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,660
Nice article.

124
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,560
Thanks Ramrod.

125
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,280
Thank you.

126
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,080
It's embarrassing though.

127
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,020
How's the audio by the way?

128
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,520
Is it too loud?

129
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,920
Too quiet?

130
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,500
Just let me know.

131
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,260
I just remembered fishing.

132
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,240
So true.

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,580
Yeah, there was a giant squid in the depths with this thing.

134
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,940
Let's just go swimming a little bit.

135
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,220
And get our bearings.

136
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,580
Hold on, let me look at all this stuff real quick.

137
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,860
Our storage.

138
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,760
We have a bunch of crates.

139
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,720
And we have these research parts.

140
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,660
What were we aiming for?

141
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,080
I wonder.

142
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,100
Generator is always hungry.

143
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,980
I've got no food.

144
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,780
Science lab.

145
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,740
Don't forget the rig still needs some kind of defense system.

146
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,040
I need a defense.

147
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,060
Okay, samples.

148
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,860
What do you want?

149
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,240
Creepy things.

150
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,640
Loot crates.

151
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,500
If only.

152
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,360
Gotta get our sea legs.

153
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,980
Music is super tiny bit louder.

154
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,410
It feels that way for me too.

155
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,330
Gotcha.

156
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,560
I've encountered strange creatures in the... I don't remember if we've read this before.

157
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,860
What do they look like?

158
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,980
Unusual weather conditions.

159
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,260
Sleep deprivation.

160
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,920
They can all lead to auditory and visual hallucinations.

161
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,460
When will I get those?

162
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,300
I already have those actually.

163
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,940
I was gonna say, when will I get the visual hallucinations?

164
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,200
I want the auditory.

165
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,560
You do?

166
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,420
Yeah, I see a snake in my bed every night.

167
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,860
Boss, we need your final say on this debate.

168
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,740
Chicken Minky or Minky Jockey?

169
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,960
I feel like Minky Jockey sounds better, no?

170
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,640
But, Chicken Minky makes more sense.

171
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,940
No!

172
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:24,680
It's like hard, because Minky Jockey sounds better, but Chicken Minky makes more sense.

173
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,140
Chicken Minky, Chicken Minky, Chicken Minky, Chicken Minky.

174
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,740
Chicken Minky gang.

175
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,540
Oh, wow.

176
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,460
Chicken Minky.

177
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,780
This is a heated debate.

178
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,990
Minky Jockey sounds nasty.

179
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:51,750
Why?

180
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:57,710
Ordering a Chicken Minky at the fancy restaurant.

181
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,330
Okay, fine.

182
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,570
Okay, fine.

183
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,470
I'm convinced for the Chicken Minky.

184
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:03,690
Minky Jockey.

185
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,870
Do we need to choose one?

186
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,210
I guess so.

187
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,970
Wouldn't it be great to have full sensory hallucinations?

188
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,010
It can't be Minky Jockey, because Minky is not the one being jocked.

189
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,090
Wait, what does that mean?

190
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,290
Is a jockey not a...

191
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,570
Apparently, people make so much noise during the Chicken Jockey scene theaters had to put out.

192
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,810
I heard that!

193
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,150
You guys, I'm so sad.

194
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,590
I was supposed to go see the Minecraft movie on Friday.

195
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:35,630
And my friends and I, we did not have time.

196
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:40,330
I was like, girls, pack your florals.

197
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,930
We're going to the Minecraft movie.

198
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:52,830
And actually, earlier, just earlier, I watched the Red Letter Media video about it.

199
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,830
I thought a jockey was...

200
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,650
Like a guy who plays sports in high school.

201
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:02,230
No.

202
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,910
That's just a jock.

203
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,450
Wait, what's a jockey then?

204
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,300
There's this one guy on TikTok that made a song...

205
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,320
In the tune of...

206
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,000
What's it called?

207
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,400
I think Imagination from...

208
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,700
From Willy Wonka.

209
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,520
And I can't, I literally cannot get it out of my head.

210
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,560
Minky's straight jocking it.

211
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,740
Oh, like a disc jockey.

212
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,940
Horse rider.

213
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,860
I was like, not a disc jockey.

214
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,140
But it goes, Flint and steel.

215
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,760
Chicken jockey.

216
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
I am Steve.

217
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,840
I can't stop singing.

218
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,500
It's been like two weeks now.

219
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't know when it came out.

220
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,680
It's been stuck in my head for so long.

221
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,460
I am Steve.

222
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,500
He's like, I place blocks...

223
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,500
And do shit.

224
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,640
I don't remember the words.

225
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,260
Now that I sing it, it's gonna get stuck in your head too.

226
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,180
Brain worms acquired.

227
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,860
I know.

228
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,500
Flint and steel.

229
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,120
It's the way he sings it, because he sings it in very much a way that Jack Black would sing it.

230
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:50,840
So it's like, Flint and steel.

231
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,080
Chicken jockey.

232
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,440
I am Steve.

233
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,380
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,880
Waiter, more Minecraft TikTok songs.

235
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,560
No, please.

236
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,180
I need to recover.

237
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,820
Thank you for the ping.

238
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,720
I got to go to the Minky cafe.

239
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,980
I saw that was a thing.

240
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,460
I had so much fun yakai-ing it up on my birthday.

241
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,800
Could I get a chicken Minky pure imagination?

242
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,740
Chicken happy birthday.

243
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Happy birthday, Phantom Knight.

244
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,560
I am Steve.

245
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,800
I miss your birthday, but...

246
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,780
You were jockey...

247
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,600
On the dance floor.

248
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,380
Happy birthday.

249
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,580
Did they sing you happy birthday?

250
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,820
If not, I'm gonna possess them.

251
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,580
And make them do the Spongebob laugh.

252
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,340
You were gonna say murder, weren't you?

253
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:28,700
No!

254
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,050
I would never.

255
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,950
I would never.

256
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:42,070
Okay, so we're trying to get samples.

257
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,090
Sorry, we are playing a game, aren't we?

258
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,150
This thing.

259
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,090
These things.

260
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,470
I wonder where they are though.

261
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:49,910
Help me.

262
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:51,570
Help me, scientist.

263
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,570
I miss this.

264
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,530
I was gone for three days.

265
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,590
The laugh where you choke yourself out?

266
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:03,490
Yeah, pretty much.

267
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,250
That's what I'll do if they didn't sing you happy birthday.

268
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,390
Phantom Knight.

269
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,520
Too long.

270
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,780
Do you know anything more about the prehistoric fish I found?

271
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,400
Nothing useful, aside from confirming with some peers that they are indeed species that were previously thought to be extinct.

272
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,740
There's even a special name for that, you know.

273
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,740
Allosaurus taxon.

274
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,040
A species seemingly raised from the dead.

275
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,900
Just like me.

276
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,400
Three days is like three years.

277
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,460
What are you, a cat?

278
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,640
Actually, maybe not a cat.

279
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,920
You're like a...

280
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,000
A dog?

281
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:49,710
Meow.

282
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,330
Welcome back, Minky.

283
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,050
I missed you.

284
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:52,990
Thank you.

285
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,910
Maybe a dog.

286
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,290
Oh, stop saying meow.

287
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,850
Say woof.

288
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,070
A little bark?

289
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,890
Or a big bark?

290
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,580
Some wisps may be cats or dogs.

291
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,100
Do you think I act more like a cat or more like a dog?

292
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,570
Bow bow.

293
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,470
Like a cat?

294
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,430
I'm a cat.

295
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,350
In what way?

296
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,490
Depends on my mood.

297
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:32,850
A fox?

298
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,770
Are you saying I'm sexy?

299
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,310
I'm faxy.

300
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,590
A dog.

301
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,590
Let's just go around town and...

302
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,610
Oh, okay.

303
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,050
Get my bearings straight a little bit first.

304
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,550
So this is how we change stuff.

305
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:54,970
Atrophy.

306
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:57,730
Banish.

307
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:00,470
Let's just stick to haste for now.

308
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:04,030
Let's see what we got in the cabin.

309
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,450
Our map says to go.

310
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,510
Oh, this is the...

311
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,090
The Antarctic.

312
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:24,350
My favorite part of the movie was when Chris Pryce stepped out of the shadows and said, I'm assembling a team for a smashing fun time.

313
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,750
And it's Jack Black in the envelope.

314
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:31,850
Wait, did you guys... Okay, this is actually kind of spoilers though for...

315
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,950
For the Minecraft movie, but did you see that...

316
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,250
The post-credits scene?

317
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,890
Cat most of the time.

318
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,550
Dog when you see a cute girl or snakes, but...

319
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,090
I mean that was my wife's birthday.

320
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:44,890
She's a big fan.

321
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,950
Happy birthday, wife!

322
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,410
Our wife.

323
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,530
Happy birthday to my wife.

324
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,970
Happy birthday to my wife.

325
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:02,550
Happy birthday, my wife.

326
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:09,530
Happy birthday, my wife.

327
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:11,030
Happy birthday!

328
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,670
Guys, I'm actually so... Don't remember where to go.

329
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,210
Shoot.

330
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,350
What is this for?

331
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,550
Is this a...

332
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,990
Is this crates?

333
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:26,710
Maybe?

334
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:32,000
I think we went to... Gale Cliffs.

335
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,350
Maybe we now need to go to the Stellar Basin.

336
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,490
Check the quest log.

337
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:41,650
You are so smart, Reina!

338
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,750
Where is that?

339
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:48,590
Oh, pursuits!

340
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,450
Search for relics, catch rare fish.

341
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:54,950
Well, that's the long haul.

342
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,250
New fishies are in Stellar Basin.

343
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,930
Jurassic, thank you!

344
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,810
So I was right.

345
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,110
I was headed the correct way.

346
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:06,550
Yes!

347
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,750
This way.

348
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:10,790
No?

349
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,230
I'll get there.

350
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,290
Monstruo!

351
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,850
Thank you for the 10 gifted.

352
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,810
Sorry, 10 bucks.

353
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,470
Oh my gosh.

354
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,070
Sorry, I'm so tired.

355
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,490
Speaking of catchy songs and ocean travel, I listened to Epic.

356
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,970
Over the weekend, it was great re-listening to you sing one of the songs.

357
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,390
I hope you'll sing more in the future.

358
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:39,970
I will try.

359
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,130
Sorry.

360
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,550
A whale!

361
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,610
I want to get more crazy so we can get some giant fish.

362
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,430
I have to listen to Epic.

363
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:58,950
Sorry, I'm going the wrong way.

364
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,660
I was a whale of a good time.

365
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,280
You both said the same thing.

366
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,820
Right next to each other.

367
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,300
That's so cute.

368
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,000
Hive mind.

369
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,040
More Leviathan!

370
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,620
I want that.

371
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,920
I want more Leviathan.

372
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,360
Right click for boost.

373
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,210
Sink.

374
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,050
The sky is clearing up.

375
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:44,390
Fish more like a mince.

376
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,390
Get it?

377
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,110
I don't.

378
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,550
Also, FatGuru, thank you so much for 6 months.

379
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,130
If you're FatGuru, do you say I am FatGuru?

380
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,310
Or do you still just say I am Guru?

381
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,390
Can I catch this thing?

382
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:03,830
Let's try.

383
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,680
We did catch him.

384
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,360
And we got a fancy one.

385
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,040
Trophy, baby.

386
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,100
Let's try another one.

387
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,140
My reflex is still working.

388
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,020
I'm so sleepy.

389
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,360
I'm too good.

390
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,200
Okay, we got one.

391
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:29,840
Nice.

392
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,520
I am Groot.

393
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,580
Oh my gosh, I went to Tokyo Disney.

394
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,040
This is the last time I was in Japan, obviously.

395
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,760
But on the Small World ride, they had it as a collaboration with Groot.

396
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,580
And he would just sometimes be in the ride and he would like...

397
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,420
He was kind of ruining it because they'd all be like...

398
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,640
It's a small world after all.

399
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,820
It's a small world after all.

400
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,380
And then Groot would just be like...

401
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,580
Oh no, he would go...

402
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,940
I am Groot.

403
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,540
I am Groot.

404
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,620
Just in the middle of the song.

405
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,520
I am Groot.

406
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,760
And I'm like, why are you here?

407
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,720
I really want to clean up this sludge so bad.

408
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,140
What is it?

409
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,560
Oh, I don't have the abyssal.

410
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:28,980
No!

411
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,280
We have to go.

412
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,520
We have to go.

413
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,700
We have to leave.

414
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,120
We need to leave.

415
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,500
Why do you hate Groot?

416
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,100
I don't.

417
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
I don't know him.

418
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,380
I don't know that guy.

419
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,120
We've already done this one.

420
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,900
I went away so this is late, but congrats on your win and you're back.

421
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,300
Thanks Avril!

422
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,920
You're just in time.

423
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:52,760
What are you talking about?

424
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,980
It was only a few days ago.

425
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,820
Flint and steel.

426
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,480
Chicken.

427
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:06,580
Jockey.

428
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Sorry, I really can't get it out of my head.

429
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,300
Is this thing gonna kill me?

430
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,120
Oh, I don't have the other material though.

431
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,050
I am Groot.

432
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,470
Thanks Vald!

433
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,510
I am Groot.

434
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,350
My Krabby Pot.

435
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,030
It's full!

436
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,410
Wait, I picked it up, but I meant to...

437
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,710
Ok, good.

438
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:37,270
I got it all.

439
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,750
Needs repair.

440
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:39,230
You know what?

441
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,590
That's good.

442
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:39,990
That's good.

443
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,890
Now it's in my head.

444
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:43,650
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:46,410
I really can't get it out of my head.

446
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,890
Sea slug.

447
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,610
Is that what I needed?

448
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,990
One of them, no?

449
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,270
Yeah, he did ask for a sea slug and the eagle...

450
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,130
Well, we'll sell the good eagle shark.

451
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:00,970
Right?

452
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,470
It's not so much of a difference, maybe.

453
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,850
Thanks for the saving though.

454
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:06,510
Thank you!

455
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,830
Check your quest.

456
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,010
Yes.

457
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,710
Yes, check my quest.

458
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,130
Yes.

459
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,090
Eagle shark.

460
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,390
Sea slug.

461
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:26,830
Tripods.

462
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:27,850
Bitter fish.

463
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,430
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.

464
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,850
My ship?

465
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,070
Before I wreck my ship?

466
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,350
What is that?

467
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,290
Oh, tuna.

468
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,570
Ok, fish market.

469
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,870
Let's sell.

470
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,710
I forgot I'm pretty rich in this game.

471
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,850
Ok, so sell the good eagle shark.

472
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,690
Right?

473
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,930
How do you say that?

474
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,830
Spitter fish.

475
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,870
There's a spitter.

476
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,050
There's a little spitter.

477
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,090
And we'll sell... Wait!

478
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,170
The blue crab...

479
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,870
That buddy can make ink, no?

480
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:19,170
Or like, we can paint our ship, no?

481
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,540
Inky.

482
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,900
You need a special one.

483
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:35,760
Wow, we got a lot of sea slugs.

484
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,500
When do these guys become the hot stuff?

485
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:41,840
Medusa.

486
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,240
And...

487
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,460
The aberration crabs.

488
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,660
Thanks guys!

489
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,020
You guys are gonna be helping me a lot.

490
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,820
I'll probably be asking a lot of questions.

491
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,380
Thank you guys.

492
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,040
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 50 gifted.

493
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,640
What the heck?

494
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:01,260
Why?

495
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,820
Why, why, why?

496
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:12,030
Since it's been a minute since I've played.

497
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,550
I won't go crazy immediately.

498
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,190
But it is all coming back to me.

499
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:19,790
A little, a little at a time.

500
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,590
Is there anything?

501
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:21,890
Ok.

502
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:21,970
Ok.

503
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:25,930
Ok.

504
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,870
Confused wench.

505
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,940
I don't think we have...

506
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,350
Oh no, we do!

507
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,490
This, wait...

508
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,570
Wait, is this?

509
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:35,970
Is this?

510
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,770
No.

511
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,350
It doesn't have the little...

512
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,610
The uppies.

513
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,570
I think I need to go back.

514
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:44,930
Maybe.

515
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:46,890
What is this?

516
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,680
Increases... Oh, this is the rotation thing.

517
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,300
1, 2, 3, 1, 2...

518
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,900
Oh, if I wanted better light.

519
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,000
See, it's like, thank you for the 10 gifted.

520
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,780
Thank you!

521
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,880
No uppies.

522
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,860
Yeah, no upgrade.

523
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,780
No uppies.

524
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,050
I think we need to go back.

525
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:22,430
If I sleep, these guys should still... I don't know, they might be ok.

526
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,990
But they are just samples, so...

527
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:26,250
Ok.

528
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:28,410
I was promised uppies.

529
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:29,650
You were lied to.

530
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,210
Oh, this needs to be repaired though.

531
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:31,710
Ok.

532
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,690
Repair off.

533
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,530
Ta-da!

534
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,030
We'll...

535
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,250
Sleep.

536
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,850
Colin, welcome to Mumbo's shop.

537
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,350
Thank you.

538
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:46,970
We'll sleep.

539
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,670
We'll undock.

540
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,990
We'll place our Krabby Krab pot...

541
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,990
Similarly to where it was before.

542
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,250
Wait.

543
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,410
No.

544
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,790
How do I put it down again?

545
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,370
Oh wait, I think it's in here.

546
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,030
Krabby Krab pot.

547
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,210
There we go.

548
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,590
I am here for uppies.

549
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,470
You've come to the wrong place.

550
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,410
You've been...

551
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,910
Oh, that's atrophy.

552
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,330
Been...

553
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:34,950
Teleport.

554
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,570
Yeah, actually... Wait.

555
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:40,410
Yes.

556
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:41,470
You're so right.

557
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,350
Let's teleport.

558
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,290
Let's teleport.

559
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:51,230
And...

560
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,990
We go over here.

561
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,550
Oh, it makes us a little crazy too.

562
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,530
Wait, that's so awesome.

563
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:59,330
Minto isn't tall enough to get...

564
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,550
I am tall.

565
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:03,330
Learn.

566
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,550
What was I going to go here?

567
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:05,930
Hold on.

568
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:06,270
Sorry.

569
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,650
I had a...

570
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:10,090
Wait, I didn't put down my Krab pot.

571
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,310
What did I put down?

572
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,090
I think I got mixed up.

573
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,830
I'm okay though.

574
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,060
We'll just go to the scientist.

575
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,980
Oh, I had two.

576
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,820
Let's put another one over by...

577
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,120
The...

578
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,220
What's it called then?

579
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,350
The...

580
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,380
Oil rig.

581
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,340
Just somewhere, you know...

582
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,440
Taller than what?

583
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,640
Taller than...

584
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:58,420
You, obviously.

585
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,480
You want one in the center, like here?

586
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,780
Pot.

587
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,840
Seems like the center.

588
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,820
Maybe I should have checked the map.

589
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,320
Ah, pretty center.

590
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,280
I got him.

591
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,200
Like morrow center.

592
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,680
That's fine.

593
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,660
I like the way he looks.

594
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,520
Very cool.

595
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,060
Four months.

596
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,900
Mint was beaten.

597
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,020
Thank you for four months.

598
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:41,700
Thank you.

599
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,060
Both DLCs.

600
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,920
I do have both DLCs.

601
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,660
Yes, indeedy.

602
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,220
Yes, indeedy.

603
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,780
Nice teeth.

604
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,400
I like the eyes on this thing.

605
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,580
Looks like me when I'm crazy.

606
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay, science lab.

607
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,700
Submit samples.

608
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,100
You.

609
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,000
And you.

610
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:10,340
Now we need the...

611
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,460
And then, okay.

612
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,220
So now we go to the lady.

613
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,200
The factory.

614
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
And we get...

615
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,900
This thing must be the infused hoist.

616
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,100
Right?

617
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,900
Wait a second though.

618
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,320
I feel like the other shop it said infused hoist.

619
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:28,980
Am I crazy?

620
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:34,140
But it didn't show the little upgrades on the side.

621
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,010
Check out her cheek bones.

622
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,190
I know, dang.

623
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,220
From storage.

624
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,340
Do I have one?

625
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,200
Fathomless winch.

626
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,500
Thank you.

627
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,600
And then...

628
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,400
Oh, we need to go get some goop.

629
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,820
We need the goop.

630
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,540
I need to put on my siphon trawler.

631
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,200
And we gotta goop it up, baby.

632
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,160
You guys prefer like a...

633
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,000
For me, I don't have cheek bones.

634
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:21,860
I just got cheek.

635
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,700
But I mean, I'm a ghost.

636
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,300
I don't really have much bone about me.

637
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,000
Which do you prefer?

638
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,140
Cheek bone or all cheek?

639
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,460
Hi Minto.

640
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:36,820
Hello!

641
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,580
Depends on the cheek bone.

642
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,640
Boneless.

643
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,800
Which cheeks?

644
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,220
Oh, true.

645
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,140
You decide.

646
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,400
Ghost to Mint, what you blushing for?

647
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,400
What are you guys blushing for?

648
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,310
Okay, let's...

649
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:14,190
Let's switch out our net, unfortunately.

650
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,510
And put that in storage.

651
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,350
And then we take...

652
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,650
What's the goop, man?

653
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,990
Oh, this is our goop.

654
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,450
And we install you.

655
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,530
And we...

656
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:33,810
Is there anything else we can install while we're... You know?

657
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,590
We got a little bit of extra space.

658
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:37,530
No?

659
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:40,920
Magic.

660
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,900
The generator craves food.

661
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,900
I forgot to get my fish out the net.

662
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,640
I do that every time.

663
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,060
You're real cheeky, Minto.

664
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,800
You're a real...

665
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,000
Taquito burrito.

666
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,440
Minto cheeks are always peak.

667
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,900
You do too?

668
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,900
I always forget to get the fish out the net.

669
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,900
We even got that special tuna.

670
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,620
So sad.

671
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,320
Oh well.

672
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,280
I'm pretty rich right now, I'm not gonna lie.

673
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,700
I don't think I really...

674
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,100
I don't think I need it, maybe.

675
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,400
So much.

676
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,520
Okay.

677
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:30,640
What is that?

678
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,720
Can I put this thing down here?

679
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,740
Let me see.

680
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,660
Oh no, it goes in the light.

681
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,820
It doesn't... Let me try.

682
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,440
I can... Can I just put it... I can just put it anywhere.

683
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Wait, so then if I...

684
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,220
Wait, I want the big light.

685
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,310
I didn't realize.

686
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,410
If you reinstall it, the fish will still be in the net.

687
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,030
Really?

688
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,150
Thank you, Fluffy.

689
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,190
And then at this point, they shouldn't be...

690
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,160
Rotten.

691
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,100
Sorry.

692
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,580
I haven't sneak... Oh no.

693
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,560
That was the one, right?

694
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,880
Oh no, they're gone.

695
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:40,300
No, they're not there anymore.

696
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:41,680
Sad.

697
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,840
I've been sneezing so much recently, I don't know why.

698
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:46,920
Bless you.

699
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,640
Thank you.

700
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,440
Bless you.

701
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,220
Thank you.

702
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,920
Oh, it might be the pollen.

703
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,120
You're so right.

704
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,540
My allergies.

705
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,590
You mean someone's talking about me?

706
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,130
What are you, obsessed with me or something?

707
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,590
What are you, obsessed with me or something?

708
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,610
Okay, let's go get some goop.

709
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,630
The closest goop is around the steel point.

710
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:33,290
We'll go there.

711
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,500
A dolphin.

712
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,800
Oh, nope, orca.

713
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,360
Minto fishing stream is perfect for my birthday.

714
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:45,460
Retry.

715
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,320
Is that how you say your name?

716
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:46,820
Retry?

717
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,240
Excited to be the one...

718
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,820
Excited to the...

719
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,580
Fear fish in action.

720
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,340
Happy birthday to you.

721
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,480
Happy birthday to you.

722
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,120
Happy birthday dear retry.

723
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,680
You might want to retry your message.

724
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,080
No, just kidding.

725
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,720
Happy birthday to you.

726
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:23,390
Really living up to the name.

727
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:27,830
Mint,

728
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,950
why did you change your profile picture?

729
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,650
Mint, are you obsessed with me or something?

730
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,570
It's just because I...

731
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,510
I'm better with profile pictures than I am with, like...

732
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,150
Names, you know?

733
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:47,350
So I recognize profile pictures more than names.

734
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,150
The one... Wait, the one the fish fears is how I'm...

735
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:56,490
I got you!

736
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,470
Wait, trawl net.

737
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:57,910
Here we go.

738
00:40:59,390 --> 00:40:59,910
Lower.

739
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:01,590
There we go.

740
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:02,450
Collect!

741
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,830
Collect, collect, collect.

742
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,030
Collect, collect, collect.

743
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,310
Collect, collect, collect.

744
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:09,550
Collect.

745
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,580
Collect, collect.

746
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,600
Yummy, yummy.

747
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,140
Goop.

748
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,260
How many have I gotten?

749
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:37,820
Zero?

750
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:38,440
Okay.

751
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,860
Goop goes up.

752
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,220
Goop stonks are...

753
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,320
Oh no!

754
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,700
We got the goop.

755
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,220
We got gooped, we got gooped.

756
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:49,600
Okay.

757
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,920
Oh, I realized we have this little slug on here.

758
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,760
Uh oh, crab?

759
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:55,980
You're stale.

760
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,200
Mint obsessed with us for real, for real.

761
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,480
I tapped out for a sec.

762
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,500
Did you say the fish weren't in the net anymore?

763
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,540
If so, I'm sorry.

764
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,180
They usually were whenever I accidently...

765
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,500
They weren't, but it's okay.

766
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:10,880
You don't need to apologize.

767
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,120
I feel worse when you send a super chat to apologize.

768
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,480
I'm not gonna lie.

769
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:33,210
Wait, nothing equipped.

770
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:38,130
Wait, I haven't made... Has it been sucking?

771
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,490
Oh, it's sucking.

772
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:42,870
Wait, why am I...

773
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:43,790
There we go.

774
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,630
It's sucking alright.

775
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:47,910
Okay, we're good.

776
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,670
Watch out, watch out.

777
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:54,850
No!

778
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,230
Got me from behind.

779
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,250
Oh, special, special, special.

780
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,230
What's this one?

781
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,880
Alright.

782
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,170
Wow, he's cool.

783
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:23,890
What are you saying?

784
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,090
What do you mean?

785
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:27,450
What are you talking about?

786
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,710
What am I saying?

787
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:32,650
Oh no.

788
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:36,570
Let's go to sleep.

789
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:37,790
Wait a second.

790
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:39,850
This is fabric.

791
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,010
Which one is the fabric one actually?

792
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:43,490
I don't remember.

793
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,530
This is the fabric one.

794
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,260
We gotta get all our upgrade supply stuff, baby.

795
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:06,750
Depleted.

796
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:06,830
Depleted.

797
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,110
Spooky rocks.

798
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:18,410
Do we still need cloth?

799
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,370
Do we not?

800
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:22,670
I don't have any.

801
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,390
I feel like we always need materials.

802
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:25,610
No?

803
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:31,010
We did get the one net that scoops up the materials though.

804
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,030
And then we got...

805
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:34,830
Oh, our net.

806
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:37,190
Okay, we have one thing of dark canister.

807
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,850
Oh, no, that's not what I meant to do.

808
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,270
Let's sleep and we'll keep scooping.

809
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,550
I apologize for absolutely nothing.

810
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,030
Okay.

811
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,440
We'll just keep scooping up this goop.

812
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,660
And maybe... Because, I mean, we're gonna need it in the future anyway, so might as...

813
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,580
Might as well.

814
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,140
What does this thing do?

815
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:11,660
The

816
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,340
music in this game makes me so...

817
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,600
Like I just wanna... Makes me wanna yawn.

818
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,480
Okay, that was close.

819
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,360
What's that sound?

820
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,040
What's happening?

821
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,400
I'm in trouble.

822
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,040
Haste.

823
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,540
Leave me alone!

824
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:44,990
Leave me alone!

825
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,990
I'm trying to scoop!

826
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:47,750
Oh my god.

827
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:55,500
Down.

828
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:56,900
There we go.

829
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:57,320
Nice.

830
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:02,100
We'll just have it out in case that happens again.

831
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,120
Why am I crazy?

832
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,560
Yeah, can't a woman scoop in peace?

833
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,060
This is just...

834
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:16,160
Stuff like this though, it's kind of like... It's very Power Wash Simulator-esque, you know?

835
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:23,160
So it's just kind of like satisfying to go through and scoop and...

836
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,140
You know?

837
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,620
Just feels good to scoop it all up.

838
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,080
Like reverse Splatoon.

839
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,560
Splatoon is also very satisfying though, no?

840
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:38,900
You know?

841
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:39,680
What do you think?

842
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,460
Wait, I think I missed a spot.

843
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,360
I did the tiniest spot.

844
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:45,100
Oh my god.

845
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,920
Okay, I think we got it.

846
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,640
Mario Sunshine.

847
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
No, I haven't played that one.

848
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,520
I was never a Mario...

849
00:46:59,040 --> 00:46:59,980
Person, you know?

850
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,300
Never really got into Mario.

851
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,480
But maybe now, I would probably be more.

852
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,140
Just, you know, as a kid I never really played any of them.

853
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,180
Astrobot is Sony Mario.

854
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,060
I know, but Astrobot is so cute.

855
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,580
I can either play as a cute robot or a fat old man plumber.

856
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,360
Actually, both of those sound pretty appealing.

857
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:32,980
You know what?

858
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,220
Let's take it back.

859
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,700
Mario cute.

860
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,240
He is a cute little guy, I agree.

861
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,180
He is a cute little guy.

862
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:58,840
I mean... Wait.

863
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,040
Where did all the goop go?

864
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,240
I think I'm in trouble.

865
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,060
Wait.

866
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,280
Oh, there's goop.

867
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:06,420
I'm scared.

868
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,120
I'm scared.

869
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,160
Where did the goop go?

870
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,440
There was like way more goop, no?

871
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,500
Mario is canonically 25?

872
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,950
It's literally that meme...

873
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,010
Where it's just like how the youth see old people, right?

874
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,890
Where it's like you hit 25 and it's just like you're just a grandpa.

875
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:44,210
Wait, I didn't scoop all this up, no?

876
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,770
I'm so confused right now.

877
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:47,550
Did I really clean this area?

878
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:49,870
It's all gone.

879
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,770
Okay, well we got two.

880
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:56,110
Three!

881
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,110
Never mind, let's go.

882
00:48:57,110 --> 00:49:04,530
For an episode of the deadliest catch, this mid-mid captain is using some strange methods.

883
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:08,250
I'm a better scooper than I realize.

884
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:09,170
I guess so.

885
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:10,950
Wow.

886
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,570
This is my birthday.

887
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:14,430
Epic carrot!

888
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:15,330
Happy birthday!

889
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,530
Happy birthday to you.

890
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:22,930
Happy birthday to you.

891
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,390
Happy birthday, epic carrot.

892
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:32,810
Happy birthday to you.

893
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:35,510
Happy birthday!

894
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,870
Hold on, I want to check on my crabs here.

895
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,170
This is my crab?

896
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:41,950
No, this is my crab.

897
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,760
Bunch of stinking prawn.

898
00:49:57,770 --> 00:49:58,450
Shrimp.

899
00:49:58,850 --> 00:49:59,950
We're feasting tonight.

900
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:11,380
Good morning!

901
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,020
Fish love Minto and women fear her.

902
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,620
Thanks Lilette for 5 bucks.

903
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:23,640
Thank you.

904
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:27,340
I love any time you pop up because I love seeing your OC.

905
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,970
Oh, I've been trying to keep a record of where all that dark liquid has been showing up.

906
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:36,850
Come see me if you need.

907
00:50:36,930 --> 00:50:37,830
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

908
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:38,510
We're good, we're good.

909
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:39,510
Factory.

910
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,890
Factory.

911
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:46,990
Alright, let's make an infused hoist.

912
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:49,230
Throw those in storage.

913
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:55,710
Oh, I put that in storage.

914
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:01,070
Next, we take you and we put you in storage.

915
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:04,870
We uninstall you into storage.

916
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,190
We take... wait.

917
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,190
Wait.

918
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,290
Oh, oh well, yes.

919
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:11,970
And it also needs repair.

920
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:15,930
But we...

921
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,950
Infused hoist.

922
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,050
This has gotten so complex.

923
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:26,970
I know, right?

924
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,930
I think we can switch out this.

925
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,970
Or we can have both, but we'll switch it out.

926
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:38,910
We'll switch it out.

927
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,310
Uninstall.

928
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:42,590
To the storage.

929
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,650
You...

930
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:47,670
Here?

931
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,720
Keep the sucker.

932
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,320
We can come... We can get it back later, no?

933
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,320
Ew, where'd you come from?

934
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,200
Oh, oh, it's rot.

935
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,380
Oh, that's gross.

936
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,740
Goodbye.

937
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:15,780
Okay, now we'll just sell the rest of the stuff.

938
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,920
That was my sea slug, I know.

939
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,180
Now we gotta go back to...

940
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,700
The place.

941
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:32,220
We gotta go to the place.

942
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,240
The Stellar Basin place.

943
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,960
Azaeo, welcome to membership.

944
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:44,880
Thank you.

945
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,360
Poor sea slug.

946
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,760
He was so long forgotten, that poor guy.

947
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:52,160
Bikini bottom.

948
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,180
Thank you.

949
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,340
Dropping my net.

950
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,060
Dropping.

951
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,860
There we go.

952
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,460
I install it and then I forget to equip it.

953
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:12,920
Hello, hello, hello.

954
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,280
Stellar, stellar.

955
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:15,940
Basin.

956
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,000
Yes.

957
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:21,740
A whale.

958
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,580
The whales love me.

959
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,960
The fish fear me, but the whales love me.

960
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:28,880
They're always around.

961
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,080
Rye has a noose?

962
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,040
We need to craft it.

963
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:46,870
Let's get some freaky fish here.

964
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:49,990
Woo!

965
00:53:54,590 --> 00:53:56,330
This is the guys.

966
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:05,710
Ok, I'm gonna sing an old shanty for you all, ok?

967
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,710
Flint and steel.

968
00:54:12,450 --> 00:54:15,090
Chicken jockey.

969
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:18,290
I am steel.

970
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:22,250
Wait a second.

971
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,850
I knew it.

972
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:26,450
My birthday was Friday.

973
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:27,810
Celias!

974
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:29,710
Sorry for a belated birthday.

975
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,870
Happy birthday to you.

976
00:54:34,590 --> 00:54:37,750
Happy birthday to you.

977
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,650
Happy birthday dear Celias.

978
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,810
Happy birthday to you.

979
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,130
This thing we need.

980
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,800
The spitter fish.

981
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,390
They fit almost perfectly.

982
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:10,610
They're just a little bit awkward.

983
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,280
Ok, so we needed that and then...

984
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,080
Oh, I thought it was night time.

985
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,400
Oh, it is night time.

986
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,280
We needed that and then we also needed...

987
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,830
This thing.

988
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,710
Where do I find that?

989
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:37,590
My birthday was in September?

990
00:55:38,410 --> 00:55:39,450
Hush hush.

991
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,350
Is it a night guy?

992
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:51,790
Angler.

993
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,030
Firefly.

994
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:58,550
Eagle shark.

995
00:56:00,710 --> 00:56:02,070
Spitter fish.

996
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:04,030
Eagle shark.

997
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,010
Nice to see you.

998
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:08,830
Saturday is my birthday.

999
00:56:08,890 --> 00:56:09,410
Can I get a happy birthday?

1000
00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:10,330
Christian!

1001
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:11,530
Happy birthday!

1002
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,770
Happy birthday to you.

1003
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,050
Happy birthday to you.

1004
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:22,790
Happy birthday Christian Fernandez.

1005
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:27,510
Happy birthday to you.

1006
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,670
Happy birthday.

1007
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,830
Thank you everyone for the appropriate time.

1008
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,450
You don't give him the satisfaction everybody.

1009
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:40,830
What's in here again?

1010
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:42,610
This looks like scrap.

1011
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:47,030
Yup, that's some scrap alright.

1012
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:47,210
Alright.

1013
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:51,130
Check out all this.

1014
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:56,030
I'm wasting time a little bit to see if we can get...

1015
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:58,690
Eagle shark.

1016
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:01,570
Spitter fish.

1017
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,980
Spitter fish.

1018
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,900
Angler fish.

1019
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,640
Is there anything else?

1020
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,880
Oh, there's more.

1021
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:20,280
Oh, I'm a little stuck.

1022
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,400
Wait, I'm actually stuck.

1023
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,040
Okay, we're okay.

1024
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,740
Over this way.

1025
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:25,440
Oh, here we go.

1026
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,600
Over yonder.

1027
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,000
What are you?

1028
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,740
Oh, I think that's it.

1029
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,000
We're gonna have to be careful though guys.

1030
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:41,740
It's pretty far.

1031
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,280
We're gonna have to be careful guys.

1032
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:45,040
I'm scared.

1033
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:49,300
It's far.

1034
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,200
There's no one close?

1035
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,740
No one closer?

1036
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:00,230
Doesn't seem to be the case.

1037
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,400
Waiting for that to burst?

1038
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
Oh, come on!

1039
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,510
Ah, stop!

1040
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:31,490
I've never experienced that before.

1041
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,070
Wait, that was new.

1042
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,710
Oh wait, that's this guy right here though, no?

1043
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:41,310
Yeah, that's the thing we need.

1044
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:44,430
Tentacle.

1045
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:45,290
Oil tentacle.

1046
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:45,850
That's new.

1047
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:47,850
No!

1048
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:50,010
Please!

1049
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:52,670
Oh,

1050
00:58:58,380 --> 00:58:59,820
maybe he just oozes me.

1051
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:00,860
Okay, nevermind.

1052
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,080
Okay, I'm gonna get it for real.

1053
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,270
Gosh dang it.

1054
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:16,130
I'm getting out of here.

1055
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:18,810
This sucks!

1056
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:20,430
No!

1057
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:24,070
Oh no, my...

1058
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:28,810
My light...

1059
00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,770
My light got... I know what to do here.

1060
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,390
I know what to do here!

1061
00:59:36,170 --> 00:59:36,670
Bye bye!

1062
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,860
Tactical retreat?

1063
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,000
100%?

1064
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:04,530
That could have been pretty bad, you guys!

1065
01:00:06,110 --> 01:00:07,710
That was almost pretty bad.

1066
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,570
We'll repair Adam.

1067
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,530
At the oil rig.

1068
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:17,850
Close call, very...

1069
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,110
Stinking tentacles though, man.

1070
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,110
But we got everything.

1071
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,060
I always forget that you have banish.

1072
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,360
I think it's because I don't know what it works on properly.

1073
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,880
But yeah, I do also forget to have it.

1074
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,860
You don't like banishing demon fishes?

1075
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:50,020
It's not that I don't like it, it's just... Oh my gosh, why is it all prawn?

1076
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,440
Oops, sorry about that.

1077
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:54,900
I just forget.

1078
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:03,740
But also, I keep thinking I can use it on the mist and it doesn't work.

1079
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,300
It's not meant for the mist.

1080
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,220
It works on chicken jockey.

1081
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:15,640
Chicken jockey, I am Steve.

1082
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,870
We got another Leviathan!

1083
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:32,510
You can see him real good!

1084
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:41,010
Only one that saw him.

1085
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:44,270
Or only... That looks like a baby.

1086
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:47,250
Godzilla.

1087
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,450
I just ran into the thing and damaged my horn.

1088
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,490
I think it's a tech lab and all that.

1089
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,570
Let's give these first.

1090
01:02:01,770 --> 01:02:08,070
It would have been so sad if they had fallen out when I messed up there.

1091
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,470
It's just his head.

1092
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,050
The music gives slight Harry Potter vibes.

1093
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:35,150
I can hear it.

1094
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:50,570
Professor Layton.

1095
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,750
Did you guys see we are getting the new Professor Layton?

1096
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,950
That was also in the Switch 2.

1097
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:08,530
It looks so good.

1098
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:11,390
Not my kind of game.

1099
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:11,950
That's okay.

1100
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:21,730
I'm much more of an Ace Attorney girl over Professor Layton.

1101
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:24,830
But I still like Layton when I play it.

1102
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:25,690
Angel!

1103
01:03:25,930 --> 01:03:26,510
Thanks for the gifted!

1104
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,110
Kept as Layton.

1105
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,970
The difficulty is in reading it.

1106
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:10,430
Don't forget, the rig still needs some kind of defense.

1107
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:14,990
How do I build a defense?

1108
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,970
What does he want me to do actually?

1109
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,860
Quest log.

1110
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:36,790
Continue to assist the construction.

1111
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,950
Talk to the researcher about the defenses.

1112
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:40,610
Okay.

1113
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:43,390
Defenses.

1114
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:43,870
Research.

1115
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:44,190
Her?

1116
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:45,210
No?

1117
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,050
You're the engineer?

1118
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:48,790
Researcher.

1119
01:04:49,910 --> 01:04:50,470
Tech lab?

1120
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,270
No, you're an engineer.

1121
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,080
You have to talk to the lady scientist at the research facility.

1122
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:03,500
Yes!

1123
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:04,480
That's right.

1124
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,820
They said that it was his assistant.

1125
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:08,880
And he sent her away.

1126
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,520
My bad.

1127
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,080
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1128
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:12,820
Thank you.

1129
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:15,100
Okay, so we do have to go all the way back.

1130
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,800
To the Stellar, Stellar Basin.

1131
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:25,360
Thank you.

1132
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,900
I was just like, where is she?

1133
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:28,560
And we can see her place literally.

1134
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:31,840
Do you see that teeny tiny light?

1135
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,420
Can you see it?

1136
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,100
If you squint.

1137
01:05:34,860 --> 01:05:35,560
Can you see it?

1138
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,200
Did you fix the ship?

1139
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,420
I surely did not.

1140
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:48,080
Lunova, you saved us.

1141
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:49,520
Holy cow.

1142
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,860
While you're down that far south, how far along are you in the polar region?

1143
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,920
Like nothing.

1144
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,740
I've done nothing in the polar region.

1145
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:06,120
I looked around it a little tiny bit and I think I did one thing, but...

1146
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,520
Check the new upgrades.

1147
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,920
Would it be under factory?

1148
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,660
No.

1149
01:06:18,740 --> 01:06:19,940
Upgrades what?

1150
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:20,660
Under research?

1151
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:31,870
Under market.

1152
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,230
Repair all please.

1153
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,410
Thank you.

1154
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:41,530
Factory tier 3.

1155
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,470
I don't think we...

1156
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:44,290
Factory...

1157
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,310
You

1158
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:56,220
guys are such a big help today.

1159
01:06:56,340 --> 01:06:57,000
Thank you.

1160
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:00,260
We're making good progress on getting the factory fully operational.

1161
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,320
Tier factory 3.

1162
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,080
Guys, remember when like on the 3DS...

1163
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,260
Each game would like make a little sound and rune factory 4 would go...

1164
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:19,600
Rune factory 4.

1165
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:23,120
Fisherman, I think you're going to like what we can make here now.

1166
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,720
You can make a whole repair kit.

1167
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:30,320
Or a harvester's repair pack.

1168
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,240
Or some tea.

1169
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:39,580
Maybe this one's kind of good to have.

1170
01:07:44,990 --> 01:07:46,610
This one might be...

1171
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:50,150
This one might be good to have on hand.

1172
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,590
Rune factory 4.

1173
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:00,030
I think we can make it.

1174
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,610
It's a little late but...

1175
01:08:04,890 --> 01:08:08,850
When hovering over buttons you would make a sound and you could spam it relentlessly.

1176
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:11,950
Yeah, so fun.

1177
01:08:20,710 --> 01:08:22,330
My light is on.

1178
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:28,300
I don't know if I'll play the new rune factory though.

1179
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:32,380
Not so much played it before.

1180
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:33,120
Not a ton.

1181
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,820
There might have been a repair kit already in my... Wait.

1182
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,600
I'm gonna...

1183
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,100
I'll figure it out.

1184
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,400
Oh, the mist.

1185
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,320
I think I was going the right way.

1186
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,800
It feels... No, it's way too far over.

1187
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:17,740
I'm like, it's gotta be like right in the middle.

1188
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:18,700
The mist.

1189
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:22,780
Brave Minto.

1190
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,500
I just feel like it's a waste of time to go back to sleep.

1191
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:30,740
I think we can make it.

1192
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,760
The mist.

1193
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:43,470
What is that now that I think about it?

1194
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:47,510
What is that over there?

1195
01:09:47,910 --> 01:09:50,390
It's marked but I'm not quite sure what it is.

1196
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:51,550
Go

1197
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:59,600
towards the light?

1198
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:06,230
Is it the fortress?

1199
01:10:07,450 --> 01:10:08,470
Mysterious.

1200
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:27,450
Wait, it is.

1201
01:10:29,210 --> 01:10:31,950
Why is... I'm so confused.

1202
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:39,030
Don't go towards the light.

1203
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:41,710
I had to do this once.

1204
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:48,660
Researcher.

1205
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:50,380
The dog.

1206
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:51,660
Hello again.

1207
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,220
What do you need?

1208
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:54,540
Someone from the Iron Haven Corporation sent me.

1209
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,680
I didn't expect that name to follow me all the way out here.

1210
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,440
Perhaps I was naive of me.

1211
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,260
So, what do you want?

1212
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,060
Iron Haven Corporation's head scientist seems to know you.

1213
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:08,800
And I know him.

1214
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:12,300
He was the reason I was posted all the way out here so far from home.

1215
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,880
He might have mentioned that I studied under him.

1216
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:18,320
But I studied him too.

1217
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:22,200
His theories on nature's cycles were...

1218
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,280
...odd.

1219
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:29,220
He never went into much detail but his work had some curious influences.

1220
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:33,640
I heard whispers through the door of his office.

1221
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,420
Saw confusing diagrams that lingered in half-erased chalk.

1222
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,160
Chalk dust and on torn up shreds of paper.

1223
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,460
Never could make much sense of it.

1224
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,740
Is the dog chewing on a bone or rolled up paper?

1225
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,240
Oh my gosh!

1226
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:57,020
They fixed!

1227
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,620
YouTube fixed the raid thing!

1228
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:02,100
Thank you for the raid!

1229
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,760
It's black on... Oh my gosh!

1230
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,920
It's not white on white anymore!

1231
01:12:10,160 --> 01:12:11,640
Raymac, thanks for the gifted!

1232
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,540
Yeah, it's actually readable.

1233
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,360
Crazy.

1234
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,240
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1235
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,460
Tell me about the defensive tech you've been working on.

1236
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,300
Well, it's the same tech used in that repulsion machine I gave you.

1237
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:31,840
Ducky!

1238
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:32,900
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

1239
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,520
Strictly speaking, I wouldn't call it a defense system.

1240
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,980
It doesn't interact with anything on a physical level.

1241
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:44,480
You see, Ironhaven's Scientific Communication Division have long been working on...

1242
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,620
...projects to further their exertion over the natural world.

1243
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:52,120
Tez himself, CC, KBarn, thank you all for the 5 gifted!

1244
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,020
Thank you!

1245
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:58,300
Have I caught anything yet?

1246
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,480
I caught feelings.

1247
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:05,320
Glitchface!

1248
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:06,560
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

1249
01:13:09,680 --> 01:13:14,520
It's complicated stuff, but essentially they were trying to emit signals to communicate with...

1250
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,580
...anything they wanted to, I suppose.

1251
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:17,960
Digita!

1252
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,320
Thanks for the 5 gifted!

1253
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:23,580
Yeah, for Snake, obviously.

1254
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:33,740
The tech I've been working on is along those lines.

1255
01:13:34,740 --> 01:13:39,120
But instead of a wide spectrum of communication, it attempts to broadcast a single word.

1256
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,200
Flee!

1257
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,160
Not to be mistaken for Flea, the bug.

1258
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:54,320
It emits the vocalized panic responses of every animal I was able to gather acoustic data for.

1259
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:57,480
That's so interesting.

1260
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:00,980
What else?

1261
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,980
We need to protect the rig and its workers.

1262
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:07,560
I couldn't give a damn about the rig or the corporation.

1263
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,520
But not everyone there deserves to face the consequences of the corp's actions.

1264
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,360
I'll give you some schematics.

1265
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:17,580
I'm sure someone there is smart enough to decipher them and get it built.

1266
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,680
Just don't let them think this means I forgive them.

1267
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:24,840
Or that I approve of what they're doing.

1268
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:28,320
Okay, I guess we can ask this too.

1269
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:29,980
They've been constructing a drilling platform.

1270
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,640
Oh, and you're helping them with that, I suppose?

1271
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:38,840
Do you have any idea what they're even doing?

1272
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:42,420
She turns away and tries to recompose herself with a few deep breaths.

1273
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:44,520
Of course you don't.

1274
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:45,680
You're just trying to help.

1275
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:49,200
But you've seen what's happened in the water here.

1276
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:50,860
And elsewhere, I imagine.

1277
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:55,260
Okay, we sleep.

1278
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:03,260
Our poor little... Our poor little guy only gets like five hours of sleep.

1279
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:06,620
Our guy is not well rested at all.

1280
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,060
The music is kind of mysterious right now.

1281
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,740
Oh gosh.

1282
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:31,460
Oh no, the yawning is starting.

1283
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,840
I'm gonna see if there's anything worth here.

1284
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:39,500
Oceanic.

1285
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:41,500
Oh, what's that?

1286
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:45,420
I've caught you before.

1287
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:47,900
Anything that I can see that I'm like...

1288
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,480
Swordfish over there.

1289
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:54,860
Loose jaw right there.

1290
01:15:55,660 --> 01:15:56,220
What are you?

1291
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:57,280
Wait, where'd you go?

1292
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,680
Fang tooth right there.

1293
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:01,420
Loose jaw.

1294
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:05,660
Okay.

1295
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,300
And then there's this right here.

1296
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:10,800
Barracuda.

1297
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:22,700
Ew, we got some nasty one.

1298
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:24,560
Infected.

1299
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:27,640
Infected.

1300
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,180
Is that gonna ruin my other fish?

1301
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,040
I sure hope not.

1302
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,920
Maybe I should have done it like in between some of these.

1303
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,280
I think it does.

1304
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,460
Watch out for the infected one.

1305
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,120
Okay, I'm gonna get rid of it.

1306
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:49,280
It's not worth it.

1307
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,780
We still have a bit of a ways to go.

1308
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:53,800
Disease.

1309
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,180
I'm a little paranoid.

1310
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,600
Oh, not anymore.

1311
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:08,920
Took my meds.

1312
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,620
Infected fish is also not worth very much.

1313
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,600
Oh, good to know.

1314
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,900
Good to know.

1315
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,720
Here comes the sea sickness.

1316
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,880
No, stay strong.

1317
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:31,820
Why did you throw away the yummy one?

1318
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:32,940
It's spicy.

1319
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:38,300
It's got that extra goopy flavor.

1320
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:40,680
Oh wait, what's that?

1321
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:42,780
Wait, what's going on over here?

1322
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,140
What is this?

1323
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,340
This is what the wind is leading me towards.

1324
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:52,740
What is this?

1325
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,380
Wait, is this a piece of the treasure map?

1326
01:18:02,190 --> 01:18:04,250
It's just a stinking flag.

1327
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,140
It's just a stinking flag.

1328
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:15,140
What's this?

1329
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,240
Oh, here we can dredge some of these.

1330
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:22,960
Flag, let's go!

1331
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:26,720
Oh boy, the flag committee is here.

1332
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,500
The flag fan club.

1333
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:33,630
What the?

1334
01:18:34,670 --> 01:18:35,550
How?

1335
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,170
Wait, how did that...

1336
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:40,170
How did he rot?

1337
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:43,270
Wait, my special guy.

1338
01:18:44,110 --> 01:18:44,970
He rotted.

1339
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:48,510
No, from the infection.

1340
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:50,870
No, it was too late.

1341
01:18:51,010 --> 01:18:53,150
Ouch, it was too late.

1342
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:54,890
No.

1343
01:18:59,790 --> 01:19:00,990
That sucks.

1344
01:19:02,450 --> 01:19:04,350
There is something else right here.

1345
01:19:05,070 --> 01:19:06,190
I think it's more crates.

1346
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:07,330
I think we are good for now.

1347
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,860
Thank you so much.

1348
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,060
For the pink.

1349
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:20,980
Thank you, thank you.

1350
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:23,860
Me fear fish, women fear mint.

1351
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:25,400
Fish fear chat.

1352
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,700
Oh, we have defenses now.

1353
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,400
Alright, before we do that...

1354
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,880
Let's just go to the generator and we'll sell our...

1355
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,560
We got a good amount of stuff in there.

1356
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:43,300
Throw these in storage.

1357
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:44,720
That too.

1358
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,680
Sell all our stuff.

1359
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:49,780
I'll even keep the rot in storage.

1360
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,700
Someone said to keep it, so...

1361
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,040
Put all this on the bottom here.

1362
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,840
Like so.

1363
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,180
It could be neater, but that's fine.

1364
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:15,580
I fear women.

1365
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,040
What you fear is the unknown.

1366
01:20:22,860 --> 01:20:24,220
That's why you fear women.

1367
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:30,690
Maybe once you know a woman's touch...

1368
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:32,270
You'll be okay.

1369
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:34,750
Harsh.

1370
01:20:38,370 --> 01:20:40,170
Did you finish all ship upgrades?

1371
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,270
What do you mean?

1372
01:20:41,390 --> 01:20:42,490
What kind of upgrades?

1373
01:20:43,090 --> 01:20:44,150
What upgrades are we talking?

1374
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:48,130
Yeah, probably.

1375
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,400
Me don't mean...

1376
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,840
Damn, we don't...

1377
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:06,070
I'm just saying that a lot of people fear the unknown.

1378
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:08,830
Like the ocean.

1379
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:10,490
And women.

1380
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:20,930
So this is where we're going to build some sort of machine to repel those tentacles, right?

1381
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:22,590
That's what the scientist said.

1382
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:25,730
We have the stuff.

1383
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,410
Oh my gosh, we're so good at this game.

1384
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:29,830
Construct.

1385
01:21:30,210 --> 01:21:30,970
We'll get started.

1386
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:34,110
Yes!

1387
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:36,550
Defenses are primed.

1388
01:21:36,650 --> 01:21:37,650
Turning them on now.

1389
01:21:38,070 --> 01:21:38,970
This should better work.

1390
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:44,870
The droning voice begins to sound from the top of the rig, reverberating through the metal down into the deep.

1391
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:47,750
What is it saying?

1392
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:49,810
What do you think it's saying?

1393
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,370
I think this is going to make him more mad, no?

1394
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:58,950
It worked for now.

1395
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:02,490
Flee.

1396
01:22:03,570 --> 01:22:07,570
Yeah, it's saying flint and steel.

1397
01:22:08,450 --> 01:22:10,630
Chicken jockey.

1398
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:12,810
This guy here, what's this game about?

1399
01:22:14,430 --> 01:22:18,970
Basically, it's like a mysterious...

1400
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:24,470
It's like you're a mysterious fisherman.

1401
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,510
Well, you're a regular fisherman.

1402
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:28,670
And you fish mysterious things.

1403
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:29,910
Mysterious fish.

1404
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:31,510
Minto, please.

1405
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,670
I'm sorry.

1406
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:37,830
Wouldn't you also flee if you heard that song?

1407
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,270
My viewership just crashes.

1408
01:22:43,110 --> 01:22:45,410
Flint and steel.

1409
01:22:46,410 --> 01:22:48,190
Chicken jockey.

1410
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,070
I am steel.

1411
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:53,770
OK, I'll stop.

1412
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:57,170
Close tab.

1413
01:22:57,250 --> 01:22:57,570
No!

1414
01:22:57,690 --> 01:22:58,250
Come back!

1415
01:22:58,250 --> 01:22:59,530
Come back!

1416
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:02,170
How can I make it up to you?

1417
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:06,590
It's the ultimate repellent.

1418
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:12,670
The defenses are operational, emitting a droning sound that grates at the ears.

1419
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:13,750
Oh, see, exactly!

1420
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:14,870
That's what I was doing.

1421
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:16,670
Do you also fear women?

1422
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:18,850
Sometimes.

1423
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:21,490
Cloth and scrap.

1424
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:22,570
Fish and jockey.

1425
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:24,790
Oh, who the hell are you?

1426
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:32,940
Outside, the foreman is in conversation with a recent arrival to the rig.

1427
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,820
A stern looking man in a suit.

1428
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,360
He looks like Vincent Price.

1429
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,840
But sir, the sea floor here, it shouldn't be disturbed.

1430
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,020
This whole rig is built on some kind of living fault.

1431
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,400
You have to trust me.

1432
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,080
Trust you?

1433
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:53,240
You, who couldn't even keep shipments in order?

1434
01:23:53,740 --> 01:23:56,800
Who involved locals just to save your own hide?

1435
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,720
The foreman cowers behind a clipboard.

1436
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:03,080
You who put this whole operation in jeopardy!

1437
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,280
I will forgive you if you do a shanty karaoke stream.

1438
01:24:10,950 --> 01:24:12,870
I don't even know any shanties.

1439
01:24:13,650 --> 01:24:14,970
I could try and learn some.

1440
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,310
Enough of this.

1441
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,630
Your concerns end at steel.

1442
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:43,420
Your end at steel.

1443
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:47,040
And scaffolding.

1444
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,460
Don't do it, me.

1445
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:56,420
Just a little bit.

1446
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,200
As a treat.

1447
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,160
The future of this corporation is for me alone to decide.

1448
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:04,000
Fire it up.

1449
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:07,500
The drill descends once more into the blackness under the rig.

1450
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:08,920
I hope this guy gets eaten.

1451
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:14,380
This movie is going to ruin us.

1452
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,240
I'm sorry!

1453
01:25:15,940 --> 01:25:17,240
It's not even from the movie.

1454
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:18,280
That's the worst part.

1455
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:30,560
Oh no!

1456
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,580
The man in the cert turns... assert?

1457
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,840
The man in the suit turns to you.

1458
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:44,400
And we're back on track.

1459
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:48,080
While he overstepped his corporate responsibility...

1460
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,360
It appears the foreman was right to enlist your assistance.

1461
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:56,720
Yeah, the music is getting a little faster, James.

1462
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,980
There's one final building that needs to be constructed on this platform.

1463
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:10,060
Sorry, it's not Flint, but it's so close.

1464
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:11,780
Fleet Services.

1465
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:15,180
Without this building, we're unable to scale our efforts efficiently.

1466
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:16,940
Ribby!

1467
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,580
Thanks for the bread!

1468
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,580
Ribbit.

1469
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:26,340
Raymac, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1470
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,240
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

1471
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:28,980
Thank you!

1472
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,720
Thank you guys so much for the bread.

1473
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,420
Thank you!

1474
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:36,100
Hello, hello.

1475
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,260
How goes the dredge?

1476
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,660
It's fine!

1477
01:26:40,940 --> 01:26:41,980
How was your stream?

1478
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,380
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

1479
01:26:46,580 --> 01:26:47,960
Pugmug, thank you for the 5 gifted!

1480
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,280
Oh my gosh, stop.

1481
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,660
That's so stinking cute.

1482
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:52,120
Oh my gosh!

1483
01:26:52,620 --> 01:26:54,100
You are a pugmug!

1484
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,160
That's so cute.

1485
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,620
And then even your emoji is a pug and a mug.

1486
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:00,660
Okay, Martin, thanks for the 5 gifted.

1487
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:06,080
I got to play Reaple with some friends.

1488
01:27:06,340 --> 01:27:06,680
Fun!

1489
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,220
Fun, fun, fun.

1490
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,060
I love Reaple.

1491
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,780
Red Griffin, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1492
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:14,940
Thank you!

1493
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:16,760
Yup.

1494
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,180
So cute.

1495
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:21,620
Fleet services.

1496
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,480
Without this building, we are unable to scale our efforts efficiently.

1497
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:25,940
I'll cut you a deal.

1498
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:32,560
If you insist in the construction of this building, I'll permit the workers to fit your vessel with a significant hole upgrade.

1499
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:38,260
After that, I don't want to see you around here anymore.

1500
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,780
Our operation is confidential.

1501
01:27:40,820 --> 01:27:41,200
Spank!

1502
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:42,600
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

1503
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,680
GM, thank you so much for the 5 gifted.

1504
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,060
Thank you guys.

1505
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:46,840
So many gifted.

1506
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:47,380
Thank you.

1507
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:48,880
Get on with it.

1508
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:51,660
Okay.

1509
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:52,560
Fleet services.

1510
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:53,880
Alright.

1511
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:56,520
Construct.

1512
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,180
We got to work on the fleet services.

1513
01:27:59,360 --> 01:27:59,520
Okay.

1514
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:03,760
466265687542.

1515
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,800
The rest is cut off.

1516
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:05,740
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

1517
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:07,640
Did you get the McDonald's?

1518
01:28:07,640 --> 01:28:10,140
I didn't get the McDonald's toy.

1519
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:11,440
I was looking at them earlier.

1520
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,640
If I get one, I really want the potion.

1521
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:15,240
I think it's the cutest.

1522
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:17,380
GM, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1523
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,320
Ducky, thanks for the gifted!

1524
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,640
Everything should be operational here, sir.

1525
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,060
Excellent.

1526
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:24,840
Remember, fishermen.

1527
01:28:25,100 --> 01:28:27,620
I'll permit the workers to upgrade your hull with our tech gear.

1528
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:31,380
But I think you know how this works by now.

1529
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:33,280
You'll have to gather the materials yourself.

1530
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:34,660
Okay.

1531
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:35,280
Oh, wait.

1532
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:35,560
Wait.

1533
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,000
It's raining gifts.

1534
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,020
It really is.

1535
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:48,300
How do I upgrade this?

1536
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,120
Oh, wait.

1537
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,440
Oh, I already... Oh, wait.

1538
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:56,280
Okay, so if I do these...

1539
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,540
I've had this scrap here this whole time.

1540
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:08,410
We can get a whole new hull!

1541
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:12,390
Yeah, even bigger hull.

1542
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:15,190
Okay, so we need to get more wood and scrap.

1543
01:29:17,170 --> 01:29:17,970
Easy peasy.

1544
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:21,350
We'll focus on that, because I think a new hull...

1545
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,210
I think getting these right now would be really great.

1546
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:27,230
To get the tier 5 hull.

1547
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:29,010
Oh, zoo!

1548
01:29:29,390 --> 01:29:30,210
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

1549
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:32,750
The meal is kind of expensive, though.

1550
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:35,490
Hope you were able to just get the toys separately.

1551
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,970
Is it expensive?

1552
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:37,550
I don't know.

1553
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:38,970
The last time I've had McDonald's.

1554
01:29:43,010 --> 01:29:44,590
That's the upgrades I was talking about.

1555
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:46,070
Ah, I see!

1556
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:49,450
Hey, I'm inky.

1557
01:29:49,490 --> 01:29:49,990
Random question.

1558
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:50,690
I thought of...

1559
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:55,250
During the karaoke, are there any songs from the Disney Direct-to-DVD sequels you were into?

1560
01:29:55,930 --> 01:30:00,070
Are you in or out from Aladdin 3 still pops into my head every so often?

1561
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:05,210
I don't think I... There's an Aladdin 3?

1562
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,470
First of all, that's...

1563
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:09,570
It's $15!

1564
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:10,910
11 euro!

1565
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:11,490
Wow.

1566
01:30:18,230 --> 01:30:19,350
It sucked.

1567
01:30:21,310 --> 01:30:25,610
The only thing I can think of is... And I sometimes quote this, which is so funny.

1568
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:28,590
Pocahontas 2.

1569
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:32,050
Pretty sure that was a Direct-to-DVD.

1570
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:36,450
Oh gosh, how does the song go?

1571
01:30:40,990 --> 01:30:42,550
Hold on, let me look it up.

1572
01:30:43,690 --> 01:30:44,610
It was?

1573
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:45,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1574
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:51,510
Hold on.

1575
01:30:52,870 --> 01:30:53,750
Let me... Hold on.

1576
01:30:58,270 --> 01:30:58,790
Pocahontas...

1577
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:01,010
2 songs.

1578
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:03,950
Oh, yeah.

1579
01:31:04,270 --> 01:31:04,730
Yeah, yeah.

1580
01:31:04,830 --> 01:31:06,970
The song is called Where Do I Go From Here?

1581
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:10,850
But the way she sings it is so silly to me, because she's like...

1582
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:14,990
She's like, where do I go from here?

1583
01:31:17,290 --> 01:31:21,450
So sometimes I'll just be like, where do I go from here?

1584
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:26,730
So many voices whispering in my ear.

1585
01:31:31,130 --> 01:31:32,250
Dig a tunnel.

1586
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:33,390
Dig, dig a tunnel.

1587
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:34,590
Dig a tunnel.

1588
01:31:34,730 --> 01:31:35,750
Dig, dig a tunnel.

1589
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:37,410
Alright, we need... OK.

1590
01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:40,110
Does somebody want to help keep track?

1591
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:42,890
We need 3 wood, 1 scrap.

1592
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:47,270
5 wood, 5 scrap.

1593
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:52,970
What did I... 5 wood... Wait, we were at 5 wood, 5 scrap.

1594
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:57,170
So 8 wood, 7 scrap.

1595
01:31:59,010 --> 01:32:01,290
8 wood, 7 scrap everybody.

1596
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:02,830
That's quite a lot.

1597
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:04,470
Oh my god.

1598
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:05,870
Are you OK?

1599
01:32:06,610 --> 01:32:08,070
You seem concerned.

1600
01:32:08,830 --> 01:32:09,390
Concerned.

1601
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:09,730
No.

1602
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:12,550
Concerned implies...

1603
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:13,510
He turns to look at you.

1604
01:32:13,570 --> 01:32:14,850
One of his eyes is bloodshot.

1605
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:18,110
The white completely overrun with dark red blood.

1606
01:32:19,410 --> 01:32:22,130
Concerned implies that we didn't know this would happen.

1607
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:28,790
I think the scientist is a little...

1608
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:30,210
Uh-oh.

1609
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:32,550
A fish from Twisted Strand.

1610
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:32,790
OK.

1611
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:36,930
He never asks for these, but then suddenly the quest appears.

1612
01:32:39,790 --> 01:32:40,990
Yeah, he's busy.

1613
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:47,090
Alright, we are going to... Wait.

1614
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,370
We're going to dock.

1615
01:32:51,150 --> 01:32:51,670
No.

1616
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,450
We're going to the... Undermarket.

1617
01:32:56,010 --> 01:32:57,370
We are going to...

1618
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:01,310
Get our material harvester.

1619
01:33:04,170 --> 01:33:07,350
There's nothing in the net, so we can uninstall that.

1620
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:08,870
Take you.

1621
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:11,350
Uninstall here, or install here.

1622
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:15,470
Benton Roy, welcome to membership.

1623
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:16,370
Thank you.

1624
01:33:16,490 --> 01:33:17,270
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1625
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:18,890
Oh, and we're gonna repair it.

1626
01:33:21,070 --> 01:33:21,470
OK.

1627
01:33:22,050 --> 01:33:24,590
Now this will be...

1628
01:33:24,590 --> 01:33:27,510
Us farming a little bit for...

1629
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:32,160
For some material.

1630
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:35,940
How much did I need?

1631
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,600
She's a bit too excited.

1632
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:40,860
Sounds like me.

1633
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:40,920
Hmm.

1634
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:46,340
Alright.

1635
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:51,340
I'm gonna go over to this area first, because I know there was some stuff here.

1636
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,440
And then we can go over there.

1637
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,520
Just a little bit.

1638
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:11,760
Nice, we got something.

1639
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,180
What's this?

1640
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:16,380
Sparkle.

1641
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:25,100
Trophy.

1642
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:28,520
Did I ever find the old mayor?

1643
01:34:31,950 --> 01:34:34,410
I'm not quite sure if I did or not.

1644
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:39,970
Luckily, we only need scrap and...

1645
01:34:39,970 --> 01:34:41,330
And wood.

1646
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:43,890
Kinda lucked out.

1647
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:46,990
I feel.

1648
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:51,030
Oh, oops.

1649
01:34:51,030 --> 01:34:51,790
There we go.

1650
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,430
Oh, even more?

1651
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:57,010
Wow.

1652
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,210
Ah, shoot.

1653
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:10,300
Kimi, I'm so glad you're back.

1654
01:35:10,420 --> 01:35:10,700
Thanks!

1655
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,780
I was gone for like three days, guys.

1656
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:19,840
I did mention this in the karaoke, though.

1657
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:22,960
The next couple of months are...

1658
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,680
Quite busy for me, so...

1659
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:27,460
Fortunately, there will be...

1660
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,520
More time off than I'm off doing things.

1661
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:39,620
I apologize in advance.

1662
01:35:43,460 --> 01:35:44,540
That was so close.

1663
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:50,940
Go do big things.

1664
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,740
Some of them are big things, so...

1665
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:59,120
I always wish, though, that I could like, you know...

1666
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,820
I mean, obviously, I don't have to keep everything a surprise.

1667
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,580
But what's the fun in me being... If I were to be like...

1668
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,840
Oh, by the way, guys.

1669
01:36:08,440 --> 01:36:09,160
You know?

1670
01:36:10,480 --> 01:36:10,840
Like...

1671
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:15,260
Because I would love to be like, I'm going to this place to...

1672
01:36:15,260 --> 01:36:17,740
Do this thing or whatever, you know?

1673
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,340
So make it be like, oh, you have this to look forward to.

1674
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,720
But right now, it's just...

1675
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:23,820
Everything has to be a secret.

1676
01:36:24,140 --> 01:36:25,600
Well, it's more fun if it's a secret.

1677
01:36:25,780 --> 01:36:26,540
It doesn't have to be.

1678
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:29,740
I mean, I'm on my own.

1679
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:30,600
I don't have to...

1680
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,540
I don't have to...

1681
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:37,280
You know?

1682
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:42,260
Be held by company.

1683
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,920
Whoa, we got a nasty guy.

1684
01:36:49,780 --> 01:36:52,200
I think I can fit... Oh, it's been depleted anyway.

1685
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:55,540
My immersion.

1686
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:56,840
What are you talking about?

1687
01:36:56,940 --> 01:36:58,520
I'm not spoiling anything.

1688
01:37:08,780 --> 01:37:10,420
We don't hear nothing.

1689
01:37:14,880 --> 01:37:17,580
It's kind of early, but I'm just going...

1690
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:20,220
I just want to get some of the scrap and stuff put into place.

1691
01:37:31,900 --> 01:37:32,320
Something...

1692
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,500
Spooky.

1693
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,000
Is there anything beyond?

1694
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:36,880
Like, look how much map there is left.

1695
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,320
What is up here?

1696
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,320
Are they gonna release more DLC or like...

1697
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,540
There's nothing up there.

1698
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,440
You can go look.

1699
01:37:55,630 --> 01:37:57,150
One way to find out.

1700
01:37:58,450 --> 01:38:01,150
We could just go check it out for the fun of it, you know?

1701
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,940
Wait, is there anything that I can actually complete here?

1702
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,400
We can actually complete some of this.

1703
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:16,940
Thank you.

1704
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:24,100
We could get more engine.

1705
01:38:24,300 --> 01:38:25,140
Faster, baby.

1706
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:25,840
Faster.

1707
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:32,520
We are speed.

1708
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:34,540
We are speed.

1709
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:41,360
And now we go to the Undermarket.

1710
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:44,720
Then we buy it.

1711
01:38:47,500 --> 01:38:49,420
My server.

1712
01:38:50,260 --> 01:38:52,140
Oh wait, we can sell.

1713
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:52,800
Oh, repair?

1714
01:38:53,080 --> 01:38:53,720
What am I repairing?

1715
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,240
Oh, I think my harvester.

1716
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:59,000
Oh wait, what's in my net?

1717
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:06,820
I am speed.

1718
01:39:06,940 --> 01:39:08,360
Oh, you guys are worse than me.

1719
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,340
You guys are 100% worse.

1720
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,480
I didn't even...

1721
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:20,070
I didn't even think that.

1722
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:25,790
Get well soon.

1723
01:39:35,850 --> 01:39:37,650
We were possessed.

1724
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:47,700
Sure you were.

1725
01:39:48,780 --> 01:39:50,080
Possessed, huh?

1726
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,500
Sure you were.

1727
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:53,560
Sure you were.

1728
01:39:56,860 --> 01:39:58,880
I like how I...

1729
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:00,260
Wait, why can't I pick that up?

1730
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:02,040
Weird.

1731
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:18,100
Oh, can we upgrade the foundry?

1732
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,940
Oh, still waiting on the delivery.

1733
01:40:22,540 --> 01:40:24,280
Ah, we can, we can, we can.

1734
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,760
Upgrade the foundry, please.

1735
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,040
I think we have another thing we can upgrade too.

1736
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:37,400
Wow, we can just make these now.

1737
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,620
We can make refined metal.

1738
01:40:40,180 --> 01:40:41,900
Oh my god, that's actually huge.

1739
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:42,760
What?

1740
01:40:42,820 --> 01:40:44,440
We can make research parts.

1741
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:47,960
Storage boxes are like everywhere.

1742
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:49,340
Wait, we can make wood.

1743
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:50,380
Wait, wait.

1744
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,780
How much was the wood?

1745
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:57,100
Because we need some right now.

1746
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,980
It's a storage box, but let's see.

1747
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,680
Let's upgrade the factory instead.

1748
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:08,900
Oh, nevermind, I only have one.

1749
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,400
Okay, nevermind.

1750
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:15,220
Maybe it's not ideal, but I'm gonna make some wood.

1751
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,040
I mean, yeah, I'm gonna make some wood.

1752
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:25,020
Because...

1753
01:41:25,700 --> 01:41:28,460
We need that for the blueprints right now.

1754
01:41:33,690 --> 01:41:34,830
What was I... Oh.

1755
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,050
Here, here, here.

1756
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,600
And I'm impatient.

1757
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,780
Now for this.

1758
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,540
Okay.

1759
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:50,400
Alright, we need two wood and one scrap.

1760
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:51,880
Hello, Minto.

1761
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:54,400
I mean everything I say of my own will.

1762
01:42:07,220 --> 01:42:09,580
I'm a carpenter now, call me Sabrina.

1763
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:10,820
Rock instead.

1764
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:15,420
Wrong mind game.

1765
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,880
Wait, do I have to...

1766
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,140
These are automatic, right?

1767
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:21,740
Modifies the cargo space.

1768
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,560
Yeah, let's...

1769
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,060
Wait, um...

1770
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,260
I think I can add an extra light here.

1771
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:33,940
I have this guy.

1772
01:42:36,640 --> 01:42:38,000
It'd be kind of fun to have.

1773
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:43,960
Oh, we can get another!

1774
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,240
If I sleep, will he spawn a new one?

1775
01:42:51,380 --> 01:42:51,540
I wonder.

1776
01:42:57,010 --> 01:42:57,370
Okay.

1777
01:42:58,530 --> 01:42:59,070
Undock.

1778
01:43:00,470 --> 01:43:01,950
Dropping some pots.

1779
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:04,930
Yeah, I'm gonna drop a pot right here.

1780
01:43:20,380 --> 01:43:22,140
Oh wait, actually this would be better.

1781
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:24,200
Vivicorn!

1782
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:25,240
Thank you.

1783
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:32,000
What does it say?

1784
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:36,060
Oh, it says chicken jockey.

1785
01:43:59,690 --> 01:44:02,270
It's so stinking dumb.

1786
01:44:02,570 --> 01:44:04,110
It's so...

1787
01:44:04,110 --> 01:44:06,630
It's just so stinking stupid.

1788
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:20,140
Okay, okay, we got another thing.

1789
01:44:23,540 --> 01:44:25,600
Let's head over this way.

1790
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:30,740
Oh,

1791
01:44:34,440 --> 01:44:36,020
I was like, what is that?

1792
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:40,260
The music is spooky too all of a sudden.

1793
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:40,520
Why?

1794
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:47,140
Let's grab some more wood.

1795
01:44:47,820 --> 01:44:48,500
We need what?

1796
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:49,920
Two wood and one scrap?

1797
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:50,520
Was that it?

1798
01:44:55,700 --> 01:44:57,340
Two wood, one scrap.

1799
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:02,600
Yes, okay.

1800
01:45:03,260 --> 01:45:04,060
Chicken jockey.

1801
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:05,860
Jockey.

1802
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:07,900
Chicken jockey.

1803
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:08,900
Chicken jockey.

1804
01:45:18,470 --> 01:45:21,830
This stinking movie has a hold on everyone right now.

1805
01:45:21,890 --> 01:45:22,710
It's pretty funny.

1806
01:45:32,370 --> 01:45:33,010
I

1807
01:45:37,350 --> 01:45:40,870
don't think

1808
01:45:45,410 --> 01:45:45,810
he heard.

1809
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:05,160
That's right, I forgot what this one does.

1810
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,100
It pings the fish.

1811
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:17,840
What's that sound?

1812
01:46:21,950 --> 01:46:22,870
What was I doing?

1813
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:24,630
Oh, athlete services.

1814
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:29,790
Okay.

1815
01:46:33,250 --> 01:46:34,910
What does it want me to install here?

1816
01:46:36,150 --> 01:46:41,550
The spookiness is... Oh, it's what we'll gain extra.

1817
01:46:41,690 --> 01:46:42,050
Nice.

1818
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:50,550
The spookiness is caused by fatigue and a lack of vitamin C.

1819
01:46:53,970 --> 01:46:55,190
Check the net.

1820
01:46:55,450 --> 01:47:00,350
Oh my god!

1821
01:47:02,030 --> 01:47:03,410
You guys!

1822
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:05,510
That's huge.

1823
01:47:05,770 --> 01:47:07,610
We're so close!

1824
01:47:10,450 --> 01:47:12,030
New hole soon!

1825
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:17,830
Oh my god, we just got to get one more crate.

1826
01:47:18,150 --> 01:47:21,050
Which we might... No, I think I need a scrap.

1827
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:25,170
I was going to say we might be able to make one.

1828
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:31,040
I need a scrap.

1829
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:31,580
Scrap.

1830
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:37,600
New hole.

1831
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:41,300
Though...

1832
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:44,860
We can switch some of the stuff around now.

1833
01:47:44,940 --> 01:47:45,580
So let's... Okay.

1834
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:46,480
Uninstall.

1835
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,480
Let's put this here.

1836
01:47:50,260 --> 01:47:51,020
Install.

1837
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:51,720
There we go.

1838
01:47:52,380 --> 01:47:53,300
Let's do that.

1839
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:54,560
And then...

1840
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:57,560
We can put another big guy.

1841
01:47:59,220 --> 01:47:59,860
You.

1842
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:06,420
I wonder which way it's supposed to go.

1843
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:09,880
Have a combined fishing speed of 200%!

1844
01:48:11,060 --> 01:48:11,660
Nice.

1845
01:48:13,900 --> 01:48:17,560
And with that... I think that's like...

1846
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,160
So good for what we need.

1847
01:48:23,640 --> 01:48:24,840
The factory...

1848
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,520
Eventually we'll have to get like this one, right?

1849
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:30,560
Obviously, because the mangrove and coastal...

1850
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,320
But we're covering a ton of our bases right here.

1851
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:35,600
Just this.

1852
01:48:36,340 --> 01:48:38,300
Someone said to put out flotsams.

1853
01:48:38,940 --> 01:48:40,500
Flotsam traps.

1854
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:47,260
But I...

1855
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:51,700
Trying to think.

1856
01:48:56,540 --> 01:48:57,660
I'm going to rest.

1857
01:48:58,640 --> 01:49:00,640
I did not rest very much, but that's okay.

1858
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:04,460
And we're going to go to that other area over here.

1859
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:10,140
Oh yeah.

1860
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:10,780
Oh, dang it.

1861
01:49:10,820 --> 01:49:11,540
That's what I was going to do.

1862
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:12,760
I was going to switch out my net.

1863
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:14,280
You know what?

1864
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:15,100
It's fine for now.

1865
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:21,260
I don't think it hurts to collect just a few more things.

1866
01:49:22,100 --> 01:49:22,440
You know?

1867
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,780
I can always switch it out over here too.

1868
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:37,310
Into...

1869
01:49:37,310 --> 01:49:38,590
Yeah, it's right around here.

1870
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:42,870
Oh wait, we might need the mangrove for this, no?

1871
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:44,750
Think about it.

1872
01:49:49,210 --> 01:49:51,130
I was right!

1873
01:49:52,630 --> 01:49:55,210
I hate being such a genius.

1874
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:59,090
I hate being so smart.

1875
01:50:06,110 --> 01:50:08,750
Here I was, thinking that we were set.

1876
01:50:09,430 --> 01:50:10,690
That we were so good.

1877
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:22,760
I guess I'll just leave.

1878
01:50:26,530 --> 01:50:30,090
I guess we'll just get some more fish to sell.

1879
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:34,190
Actually...

1880
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,460
Let's go see if we can find a crate.

1881
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,680
Yeah, exactly.

1882
01:50:45,980 --> 01:50:46,740
Let's go find a crate.

1883
01:50:47,540 --> 01:50:50,500
Pirate, you and I are on the same wavelength.

1884
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:57,410
Crate, crate, crate...

1885
01:50:57,410 --> 01:51:09,430
Crate, crate, crate...

1886
01:51:09,430 --> 01:51:12,110
Thank you!

1887
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:16,150
Dredge!

1888
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,160
I didn't need to mark it at all.

1889
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:25,940
I see it right...

1890
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:26,840
Oh, there's two!

1891
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:28,060
Perfect.

1892
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:46,200
Not gonna lie guys, I'm starting to fade a little bit.

1893
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:50,020
In terms of...

1894
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:52,040
awareness.

1895
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:57,880
Is that what are you... In terms of me staying awake.

1896
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:06,190
This game is just too cozy comfy.

1897
01:52:08,630 --> 01:52:11,290
Just too cozy comfy for me.

1898
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:17,640
Boing!

1899
01:52:20,820 --> 01:52:22,940
Oh my gosh, you can see the...

1900
01:52:22,940 --> 01:52:25,360
the flea beam.

1901
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:26,980
It's so cool.

1902
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:34,560
The minto is eeping.

1903
01:52:36,900 --> 01:52:38,140
Wait, stop it!

1904
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:53,700
Rocks don't really form out this far, but...

1905
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:56,740
I think rocks are the only thing really for the light, no?

1906
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:03,480
Or does other stuff happen when you are in the dark?

1907
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:05,200
Mysterious.

1908
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:12,470
Mint, have you ever had pho?

1909
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:17,330
You know, if you ate pho everyday, some could say you were a...

1910
01:53:17,330 --> 01:53:18,590
a furry.

1911
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,080
Oh, it slows down.

1912
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:26,300
Oh, you get mad faster, slows down the panic.

1913
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:27,620
I see.

1914
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:29,360
I see, I see.

1915
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:32,840
Okay, goodbye money!

1916
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:37,260
Upgrade to the fifth tier hall!

1917
01:53:44,350 --> 01:53:46,890
Oh, why did I move my stuff around?

1918
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:48,210
It's kind of funny.

1919
01:53:49,530 --> 01:53:52,010
I like how I carry these and I never use them.

1920
01:54:05,270 --> 01:54:05,750
But...

1921
01:54:08,810 --> 01:54:12,070
But, you see here... Wait, let's get this stuff out first.

1922
01:54:12,070 --> 01:54:14,070
Oh, we got a little treasure.

1923
01:54:18,980 --> 01:54:21,720
You can see...

1924
01:54:23,740 --> 01:54:26,720
Oh, I think our...

1925
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,840
Our other net...

1926
01:54:30,840 --> 01:54:32,540
Wait, where is... Oh, this one.

1927
01:54:34,620 --> 01:54:38,380
I won't be able to fit these guys, you know what I mean?

1928
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:42,240
Oh, wait.

1929
01:54:42,640 --> 01:54:44,420
I think I can upgrade these now.

1930
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,800
Or actually make them, I mean.

1931
01:54:47,240 --> 01:54:47,720
Oh, wait!

1932
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:49,020
I only have one goop left!

1933
01:54:49,060 --> 01:54:49,340
No!

1934
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:51,080
Wait, is this the mangrove one?

1935
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,760
Let me make sure I'm making the right one.

1936
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:53,760
Yes, okay.

1937
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,480
Tier four.

1938
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,120
Oh, do I... Oh, wait, it's bait refinement?

1939
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:01,380
I would rather...

1940
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:04,140
get the rod first.

1941
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,460
I need the anti-tangle line.

1942
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:10,120
I don't think I have that.

1943
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:17,060
Anti-tangle!

1944
01:55:18,700 --> 01:55:19,960
Anti-tangle here.

1945
01:55:26,770 --> 01:55:28,550
Because we need this for the mission.

1946
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:37,580
Okay.

1947
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:40,300
Okay.

1948
01:55:45,130 --> 01:55:47,850
I'll put... Actually, well...

1949
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:49,390
I can make this one too.

1950
01:55:49,670 --> 01:55:50,410
Oh, no, I can't.

1951
01:55:53,690 --> 01:55:56,130
We'll put this one in tier four then for now.

1952
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:03,690
It's hard to keep my eyes open.

1953
01:56:05,370 --> 01:56:06,790
Oh, my buddy!

1954
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:08,910
I'm broke!

1955
01:56:11,510 --> 01:56:13,450
Weren't we over 3k earlier?

1956
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:15,910
We're broke now!

1957
01:56:17,530 --> 01:56:18,770
That's just how it be.

1958
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:22,950
That's just how it be.

1959
01:56:27,050 --> 01:56:28,970
Let's install...

1960
01:56:28,970 --> 01:56:30,210
you.

1961
01:56:34,200 --> 01:56:37,500
And then also, we'll install you.

1962
01:56:39,760 --> 01:56:40,720
Nice.

1963
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:44,000
Okay.

1964
01:56:44,860 --> 01:56:46,480
We'll sell this little baby fish.

1965
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:47,780
Oh, wrong guy.

1966
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:47,860
Okay.

1967
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:51,280
Generator?

1968
01:56:52,720 --> 01:56:54,500
Oh, I guess I could've sold him.

1969
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:56,680
No, I don't think he takes it.

1970
01:56:56,940 --> 01:56:57,060
Okay.

1971
01:56:57,460 --> 01:56:58,820
Oh, yeah, we do need goop.

1972
01:57:00,680 --> 01:57:01,700
I think it's okay.

1973
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:05,940
I think it's okay...

1974
01:57:05,940 --> 01:57:08,260
if we...

1975
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:10,740
don't goop for now.

1976
01:57:21,600 --> 01:57:25,140
Because we don't need to go to the volcanic area for a bit.

1977
01:57:27,380 --> 01:57:28,340
Look at our ship.

1978
01:57:31,900 --> 01:57:33,460
The double lights!

1979
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:38,000
Wait, what was shining here?

1980
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:38,860
Did you guys see that?

1981
01:57:40,060 --> 01:57:41,300
Was something shining?

1982
01:57:42,820 --> 01:57:43,180
No.

1983
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,720
Wait, I...

1984
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:47,000
Have I not caught this fish before?

1985
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:48,240
What are you?

1986
01:57:49,200 --> 01:57:50,000
Sergeant fish.

1987
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:52,880
Oh, I guess I just didn't recognize.

1988
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:53,800
What do you look like?

1989
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,280
Okay, okay.

1990
01:57:59,360 --> 01:58:02,600
Now we can get all these bad boys in here.

1991
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:11,670
I'm assuming this is a thing we need.

1992
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:24,840
We're fast.

1993
01:58:25,020 --> 01:58:26,340
Hell yeah, we are.

1994
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:27,960
What are you?

1995
01:58:30,320 --> 01:58:30,740
Oh.

1996
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,440
Arapaima.

1997
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:34,320
Let's see.

1998
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:35,480
Let's check the...

1999
01:58:35,480 --> 01:58:37,180
Let's check the pursuits.

2000
01:58:37,740 --> 01:58:38,420
What do we need?

2001
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:41,460
Wait.

2002
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:42,720
Twisted strand.

2003
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:44,040
Is that where I'm at?

2004
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:46,420
Yeah.

2005
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:55,140
I don't know at all what we got.

2006
01:58:56,340 --> 01:59:00,390
I don't know what we got.

2007
01:59:01,530 --> 01:59:02,530
We got...

2008
01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:06,590
Boreapsis.

2009
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:09,730
That sounds... That sounds...

2010
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:12,790
Terminal.

2011
01:59:17,810 --> 01:59:18,920
I'm gonna...

2012
01:59:19,290 --> 01:59:22,010
See if maybe some of these are night time critters.

2013
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:24,770
I'm male.

2014
01:59:25,710 --> 01:59:26,450
No.

2015
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:33,120
Here.

2016
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,240
Oh, we've gotten this guy.

2017
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:39,020
What are you?

2018
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,540
We have not gotten this guy.

2019
01:59:44,140 --> 01:59:45,280
Ray mullet.

2020
01:59:45,440 --> 01:59:47,280
Why am I getting normal guys?

2021
01:59:49,780 --> 01:59:51,720
I wish I knew what they look like.

2022
01:59:53,480 --> 01:59:54,080
Wait.

2023
01:59:54,540 --> 01:59:56,960
I think this is... Yeah, this is this guy.

2024
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:02,700
You're fishing the normal bubbles.

2025
02:00:05,660 --> 02:00:06,620
You're right.

2026
02:00:08,200 --> 02:00:09,220
Cool guys.

2027
02:00:09,300 --> 02:00:10,480
I'm really starting to fade.

2028
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:15,120
There we go.

2029
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:18,860
My brain is really starting to...

2030
02:00:18,860 --> 02:00:21,140
Starting to close down.

2031
02:00:22,120 --> 02:00:23,700
We need some evil fish.

2032
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:24,980
We need some old fish.

2033
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:26,840
They might be evil because they're old, but you know.

2034
02:00:35,630 --> 02:00:37,110
I might need to go EEP.

2035
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:39,810
I might need to go EEP.

2036
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:44,730
I'm like basically doing 24 hours right now.

2037
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,860
We lost an engine, boys.

2038
02:01:01,080 --> 02:01:03,960
Let's go fix...

2039
02:01:03,960 --> 02:01:05,280
What are you?

2040
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:09,000
Okay, so that's... Oh, dang it.

2041
02:01:09,040 --> 02:01:09,960
I didn't mean to get it again.

2042
02:01:19,440 --> 02:01:21,220
You are the same thing.

2043
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:22,180
Yes.

2044
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:25,860
Let's go sell some fish.

2045
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:28,460
It was like a...

2046
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:32,860
Boreapsis.

2047
02:01:33,860 --> 02:01:36,860
Okay, well I know where he is, so he's pretty easy to get.

2048
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,580
We can go search for the other fishies.

2049
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:42,020
I'm just going to sell them all.

2050
02:01:42,120 --> 02:01:42,700
I'm not going to lie.

2051
02:01:43,420 --> 02:01:44,720
Because we need the money.

2052
02:01:47,720 --> 02:01:48,940
We need the money.

2053
02:01:51,320 --> 02:01:53,020
And we know where he is.

2054
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:53,960
He's pretty close.

2055
02:02:03,420 --> 02:02:05,880
It's a little bit far, but we got this.

2056
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:09,480
Get one more engine.

2057
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,860
I think I will once I have more money.

2058
02:02:14,200 --> 02:02:15,780
That's the important part.

2059
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,120
Is the cost.

2060
02:02:19,540 --> 02:02:21,120
Alright, goopy world.

2061
02:02:21,620 --> 02:02:22,200
Incoming.

2062
02:02:24,240 --> 02:02:26,580
Oh, this looks like a guy.

2063
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:27,680
A little critter.

2064
02:02:27,680 --> 02:02:29,380
Critter.

2065
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:34,820
It's really nasty looking.

2066
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:49,370
Indiana Jones music.

2067
02:02:58,190 --> 02:03:00,190
It looks like...

2068
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:05,310
I lost it!

2069
02:03:05,410 --> 02:03:06,490
That's so sad.

2070
02:03:07,290 --> 02:03:08,690
I lost it.

2071
02:03:08,770 --> 02:03:09,090
No!

2072
02:03:19,200 --> 02:03:21,220
Have you ever fished IRL?

2073
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:23,440
If so, what have you caught?

2074
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:26,640
Honestly, I can't say that I...

2075
02:03:26,640 --> 02:03:29,920
Maybe a long time ago, but I don't think I caught anything.

2076
02:03:30,720 --> 02:03:32,200
The fish really do fear me.

2077
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:35,620
They really do be fearing me.

2078
02:03:38,040 --> 02:03:40,380
They don't want to touch me.

2079
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:41,260
They don't want to do anything.

2080
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:45,620
But I would go fishing if I...

2081
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:49,200
If I could.

2082
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:51,300
If I had the chance to.

2083
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:52,180
I think it would be fun.

2084
02:03:52,580 --> 02:03:53,640
This is the...

2085
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:55,520
This is the effectiveness.

2086
02:04:02,450 --> 02:04:05,050
I think we are missing the Nipponite.

2087
02:04:05,910 --> 02:04:07,250
The weeaboo fish.

2088
02:04:10,150 --> 02:04:11,330
Dredge is such a comfy game.

2089
02:04:11,430 --> 02:04:11,650
I know.

2090
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:13,110
I think that's why it's put me to sleep.

2091
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:17,070
Not gonna lie.

2092
02:04:26,370 --> 02:04:27,510
It's dark here.

2093
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:37,760
A crab.

2094
02:04:37,880 --> 02:04:38,500
Might be it.

2095
02:04:52,150 --> 02:04:53,830
I'm just gonna get rid of this guy.

2096
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:56,550
This guy.

2097
02:04:58,650 --> 02:04:59,750
This guy.

2098
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:01,550
I'm gonna get...

2099
02:05:02,250 --> 02:05:04,830
I'm gonna get this guy right here.

2100
02:05:04,910 --> 02:05:05,670
Cause I see him.

2101
02:05:10,510 --> 02:05:11,150
You.

2102
02:05:11,590 --> 02:05:12,990
Since we sold him before.

2103
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:15,790
OK.

2104
02:05:16,270 --> 02:05:17,650
And then I'm gonna go to the...

2105
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:21,770
I'm gonna go to...

2106
02:05:21,770 --> 02:05:22,690
The oil rig.

2107
02:05:24,050 --> 02:05:24,410
OK.

2108
02:05:24,610 --> 02:05:25,010
Very good.

2109
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:28,230
Little guy.

2110
02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:38,370
Back to mother base.

2111
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:38,890
Exactly.

2112
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:45,210
Honestly, I'm seeing more benefits to having...

2113
02:05:45,890 --> 02:05:46,290
No!

2114
02:05:46,470 --> 02:05:47,510
I turned it off!

2115
02:05:49,570 --> 02:05:50,450
Did it turn it on?

2116
02:05:50,450 --> 02:05:51,690
It turned it on automatically.

2117
02:05:52,010 --> 02:05:55,110
I was literally about to say I see more benefits to having the lights off than on.

2118
02:05:55,750 --> 02:05:57,210
And then they turned it on for me.

2119
02:06:07,040 --> 02:06:08,780
Sleep in game and out of game.

2120
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:10,520
I will.

2121
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:11,620
I'll go to sleep soon.

2122
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:14,420
It is a crab!

2123
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,100
It is a crab.

2124
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:25,560
Lights are haunted.

2125
02:06:38,420 --> 02:06:41,320
I wonder if this... I'll at least put this out.

2126
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,360
I wonder if it will fit him.

2127
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:55,010
We're getting our money back everybody.

2128
02:06:57,610 --> 02:06:58,110
Crab.

2129
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:00,270
We rest.

2130
02:07:01,150 --> 02:07:03,930
I know I put one out like close to here, no?

2131
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:05,770
Almost positive.

2132
02:07:06,010 --> 02:07:07,270
I put one out like...

2133
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:09,690
Right around here.

2134
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:12,290
Oh, it's right there.

2135
02:07:12,390 --> 02:07:14,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2136
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,770
Ewww.

2137
02:07:19,050 --> 02:07:20,050
Take all.

2138
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:21,730
And pick up.

2139
02:07:21,810 --> 02:07:22,850
Let's go repair it.

2140
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,400
So we'll go put these two out.

2141
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:30,920
And then see.

2142
02:07:32,400 --> 02:07:35,000
I know I make less money selling to the generator.

2143
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:36,620
Not gonna lie.

2144
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,220
I think it's okay.

2145
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:41,060
And repair.

2146
02:07:41,800 --> 02:07:42,560
P.A.!

2147
02:07:44,460 --> 02:07:45,420
Thank you.

2148
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:55,700
I'm so bad at reversing.

2149
02:08:03,310 --> 02:08:04,810
Oh wait, is this great?

2150
02:08:05,010 --> 02:08:06,010
Nope, that's fish.

2151
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:10,770
Yeah, I do have plenty of... I do have a lot of money.

2152
02:08:10,770 --> 02:08:14,410
We like generate money really easily now.

2153
02:08:15,130 --> 02:08:15,650
Hello.

2154
02:08:17,630 --> 02:08:20,650
We generate money so easily.

2155
02:08:28,880 --> 02:08:30,140
Those fish?

2156
02:08:31,460 --> 02:08:32,240
What are you?

2157
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:36,540
What are you?

2158
02:08:37,100 --> 02:08:37,220
Oops.

2159
02:08:41,460 --> 02:08:45,730
Until we go broke again.

2160
02:08:45,730 --> 02:08:51,050
Hey, but at least we went broke repairing our bevel.

2161
02:08:51,270 --> 02:08:53,010
Making it bigger, better, badder.

2162
02:09:04,420 --> 02:09:04,940
Okay.

2163
02:09:05,900 --> 02:09:08,140
Alright, now we wait.

2164
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:13,460
And...

2165
02:09:13,460 --> 02:09:16,520
I think I'm gonna start sucking up some goop.

2166
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,020
I'm gonna attempt to suck up some goop.

2167
02:09:21,240 --> 02:09:22,820
Did we ever come up with a name for him?

2168
02:09:22,820 --> 02:09:25,200
That's a good question.

2169
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:26,560
I don't think we did.

2170
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:34,240
What was I grabbing?

2171
02:09:37,180 --> 02:09:38,420
The SS Minky.

2172
02:09:42,540 --> 02:09:44,320
I think you only need one more goop.

2173
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:48,300
I think you're right.

2174
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:52,000
But there... I feel like we have to have more goop, no?

2175
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:56,980
Like, or rather...

2176
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:02,200
I feel like...

2177
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:03,500
I don't know.

2178
02:10:06,080 --> 02:10:07,980
SS stands for super stinky.

2179
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,540
No it doesn't.

2180
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:12,640
There we go.

2181
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:12,940
Okay.

2182
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:15,060
Sucking time!

2183
02:10:19,320 --> 02:10:24,090
I think the goop respawns if you...

2184
02:10:24,090 --> 02:10:24,810
No!

2185
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:26,310
It wouldn't do that!

2186
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:28,650
Why would it respawn?

2187
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:31,690
That'd be so rude.

2188
02:10:32,710 --> 02:10:34,650
Oh, I'm not very good at...

2189
02:10:35,190 --> 02:10:35,970
I'm trying.

2190
02:10:36,330 --> 02:10:36,990
Oh my gosh.

2191
02:10:38,130 --> 02:10:41,830
I don't want the little creepy guys in the goopy tentacles anymore.

2192
02:10:45,820 --> 02:10:47,020
I'm sick of them.

2193
02:10:49,280 --> 02:10:50,920
I'm sick of it all.

2194
02:10:54,580 --> 02:10:57,360
I think though guys, I might need to go to bed soon.

2195
02:11:00,440 --> 02:11:02,240
Oh, Minky is tired.

2196
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:03,820
Minky has no thoughts.

2197
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:07,640
Minky can't even form coherent sentences.

2198
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:10,800
Minky!

2199
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,180
Thank you for the 20 gifted!

2200
02:11:13,460 --> 02:11:14,260
Thank you!

2201
02:11:16,060 --> 02:11:19,540
Like, if I were not streaming this game, I would just be quiet.

2202
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:22,840
Like, that's how I would... I would be fine doing that.

2203
02:11:24,260 --> 02:11:25,060
Oh, whoops.

2204
02:11:25,560 --> 02:11:27,840
Because I'm like, you know...

2205
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:32,260
Having to entertain a little bit.

2206
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:35,980
My mind is just off.

2207
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:38,040
Or rather, it's...

2208
02:11:38,040 --> 02:11:39,840
My mind is...

2209
02:11:41,900 --> 02:11:42,960
Silent stream.

2210
02:11:43,360 --> 02:11:46,600
Yeah, what if I just stop talking for like a couple minutes?

2211
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:47,780
Then we just suck.

2212
02:12:25,620 --> 02:12:27,240
I'm gonna keep it in the goop.

2213
02:12:32,440 --> 02:12:33,740
Let's go to sleep.

2214
02:12:36,260 --> 02:12:38,020
I fear something might happen.

2215
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:45,000
How was that guys?

2216
02:12:45,820 --> 02:12:50,840
You got all the goop noises you could wish for.

2217
02:12:54,850 --> 02:12:58,210
And we got no goop.

2218
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:01,130
Was nice, yeah?

2219
02:13:01,870 --> 02:13:03,030
You like that?

2220
02:13:04,270 --> 02:13:05,950
You like that?

2221
02:13:11,530 --> 02:13:12,430
Only... I'm just...

2222
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:17,690
Giant mud crab!

2223
02:13:20,730 --> 02:13:22,030
Did he goop me?

2224
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:23,210
Yes, he did.

2225
02:13:34,930 --> 02:13:37,550
Will this still work if it's not in the goop?

2226
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:38,710
That's my question.

2227
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:41,330
I guess it's still gonna get what I...

2228
02:13:43,330 --> 02:13:44,810
It's still gonna get what I need.

2229
02:13:46,730 --> 02:13:48,030
Yeah, okay.

2230
02:13:49,770 --> 02:13:50,830
Horseshoe crab!

2231
02:13:51,750 --> 02:13:53,130
He's so cute!

2232
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:56,250
I love horseshoe crabs.

2233
02:14:00,440 --> 02:14:01,500
I can't see.

2234
02:14:03,080 --> 02:14:04,260
Eyes stinking.

2235
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:05,700
They're so cute.

2236
02:14:06,980 --> 02:14:08,680
Horseshoe crab best...

2237
02:14:08,680 --> 02:14:10,160
Doesn't count as a crustacean.

2238
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:12,920
I mean, it's got the name crab in it.

2239
02:14:14,540 --> 02:14:16,620
Otherwise, it's a poser.

2240
02:14:19,540 --> 02:14:20,960
Now I'm lucky.

2241
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:26,380
I believe they're invertebrates.

2242
02:14:28,940 --> 02:14:29,740
Amphipod.

2243
02:14:30,200 --> 02:14:30,800
Isopod.

2244
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:31,880
We're getting all three?

2245
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:35,320
And then someone says it's a crustacean.

2246
02:14:35,900 --> 02:14:37,820
We're getting all... we're getting everything.

2247
02:14:39,260 --> 02:14:41,740
The consensus is... confused.

2248
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:48,180
Oh my gosh, I drifted just...

2249
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:50,860
They're lizards.

2250
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:51,960
They're dogs.

2251
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:57,460
They are as cute as a puppy, I'll give them that.

2252
02:15:03,670 --> 02:15:05,710
Did you know bugs are crustaceans?

2253
02:15:06,490 --> 02:15:08,310
Does it depend on the bug or...

2254
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:08,610
Ew!

2255
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:10,770
I got it!

2256
02:15:10,990 --> 02:15:12,230
That's the thingy we needed!

2257
02:15:12,730 --> 02:15:13,370
Let's go!

2258
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:17,650
Let's head back to the scientist man.

2259
02:15:17,650 --> 02:15:24,830
Well, we didn't really make a ton of progress today, but we made some progress for sure.

2260
02:15:28,210 --> 02:15:29,190
Oh my god.

2261
02:15:35,120 --> 02:15:37,780
I was so close.

2262
02:15:40,200 --> 02:15:41,620
Six, I need to crash.

2263
02:15:42,620 --> 02:15:44,040
Good night, Dwargo.

2264
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:47,420
Monocle Steve shall point at you.

2265
02:15:49,820 --> 02:15:52,080
Your voice seems a bit better from earlier.

2266
02:15:52,860 --> 02:15:54,140
I'm all warmed up.

2267
02:15:57,630 --> 02:15:59,030
Thank you, good night!

2268
02:16:00,250 --> 02:16:01,950
No thoughts, Eepy Minky.

2269
02:16:02,150 --> 02:16:03,430
What is your wisdom for today?

2270
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:14,800
If you buy...

2271
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:17,160
slip-on shoes...

2272
02:16:20,080 --> 02:16:21,920
you'll never have to tie them.

2273
02:16:46,070 --> 02:16:48,790
Sell, sell, and leave.

2274
02:16:57,350 --> 02:16:59,050
You're so fast.

2275
02:17:00,570 --> 02:17:01,930
I'm gonna go buy another engine.

2276
02:17:07,820 --> 02:17:10,420
Reminds me of that line about biting hands...

2277
02:17:12,340 --> 02:17:14,360
It's not even close to the same!

2278
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:18,160
Okay guys, I know what I want to do.

2279
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:22,560
I want to...

2280
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:24,280
put in this little specimen.

2281
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:31,120
Is it every time you dock you save, or every time you sleep at a dock you save?

2282
02:17:40,390 --> 02:17:41,430
The dock, okay.

2283
02:17:42,650 --> 02:17:43,830
Alright, so we get that.

2284
02:17:47,090 --> 02:17:53,310
As a fun fact, all insects are crustaceans and supposedly even taste like them if you get rid of the hair and the goop that is in their blood.

2285
02:17:53,870 --> 02:17:54,730
Try them sometime.

2286
02:17:55,110 --> 02:17:56,150
You know, Big Boss would.

2287
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:13,360
Why is there hair in their blood?

2288
02:18:17,950 --> 02:18:22,250
But everybody says that shrimp are just like insects of the sea, basically.

2289
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:44,030
Shrimp is bugs.

2290
02:18:44,170 --> 02:18:44,370
Yeah!

2291
02:18:45,170 --> 02:18:46,290
Shrimp is bugs!

2292
02:18:47,070 --> 02:18:48,390
They're tasty bugs.

2293
02:19:11,370 --> 02:19:12,230
Connected to the chamber.

2294
02:19:12,550 --> 02:19:13,530
Not yet.

2295
02:19:13,950 --> 02:19:14,250
Pure.

2296
02:19:14,730 --> 02:19:15,570
We'll need more.

2297
02:19:15,830 --> 02:19:16,690
Down deeper!

2298
02:19:18,050 --> 02:19:20,110
Outside the executive is talking to the foreman.

2299
02:19:20,890 --> 02:19:21,750
We're almost there.

2300
02:19:22,130 --> 02:19:23,010
Give it another push.

2301
02:19:23,350 --> 02:19:24,870
How much power can we give this thing?

2302
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:27,390
Sir, I don't think we really should.

2303
02:19:28,150 --> 02:19:34,410
The executive shoots the foreman a glance, disdain and dismissal, lacing the muscles on his face.

2304
02:19:34,750 --> 02:19:35,890
The foreman backs down.

2305
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:36,970
Defeated.

2306
02:19:38,470 --> 02:19:41,490
Setting the drill to full power, sir.

2307
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:47,730
Machinery in the drill tower steps into overdrive.

2308
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:51,650
Blurring the air with the sound of gears turning.

2309
02:19:53,470 --> 02:19:54,730
Full power?

2310
02:19:55,650 --> 02:19:56,770
What's that noise?

2311
02:19:59,510 --> 02:20:01,330
Is it the...

2312
02:20:01,330 --> 02:20:02,890
Guy is back?

2313
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:06,270
The Leviathan!

2314
02:20:25,480 --> 02:20:32,100
As the roar of the giant creature fades, it leaves behind a silence on all that witnessed it.

2315
02:20:32,620 --> 02:20:37,700
Faces stare from windows and hands grip railings, trying to process the spectacle.

2316
02:20:39,660 --> 02:20:43,660
Boss, that must have been the thing that got all our material shipments.

2317
02:20:43,980 --> 02:20:45,360
Now it's coming for the rig!

2318
02:20:45,360 --> 02:20:49,280
A murmur of panic begins to rise from the onlookers.

2319
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:53,000
No, we're close now.

2320
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:54,860
And it knows it.

2321
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:58,000
How long will it take for the drill to break through the next layer?

2322
02:20:59,740 --> 02:21:01,940
It still has a little ways to go.

2323
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:04,180
But you can't be serious.

2324
02:21:04,360 --> 02:21:05,040
Sure, surely.

2325
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:07,240
Not with that thing in the water here.

2326
02:21:07,580 --> 02:21:09,960
Our lives are in danger and you want to keep drilling?

2327
02:21:10,980 --> 02:21:11,900
Get it done.

2328
02:21:11,900 --> 02:21:18,180
The executive turns and walks away towards his office, leaving the foreman shaking his head.

2329
02:21:23,490 --> 02:21:29,190
Golly gee, know-it-all executive in an eldritch horror setting, what could possibly go wrong?

2330
02:21:30,630 --> 02:21:32,250
I am serious and...

2331
02:21:32,250 --> 02:21:33,470
No, call me Shirley.

2332
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:35,230
He's insane.

2333
02:21:35,730 --> 02:21:36,890
What the hell are we doing here?

2334
02:21:37,370 --> 02:21:40,050
This drill... whatever's down there...

2335
02:21:40,050 --> 02:21:42,470
We shouldn't be disturbing it.

2336
02:21:42,910 --> 02:21:44,210
It's like shaking.

2337
02:21:45,370 --> 02:21:47,050
Fisherman, you've got to help us.

2338
02:21:47,290 --> 02:21:48,390
He won't listen to reason.

2339
02:21:49,250 --> 02:21:52,510
But perhaps he'll listen to an operational setback.

2340
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:53,930
What do you have in mind?

2341
02:21:54,690 --> 02:22:01,010
We can't shut down the drill ourselves, not without repercussions from the corporation following us for the rest of our lives.

2342
02:22:02,870 --> 02:22:10,690
But if it were to be damaged by a force of nature or a force of the deep, we'd have no choice but to abandon our positions.

2343
02:22:10,690 --> 02:22:16,830
I know it sounds crazy, but if the defenses were to stop operating suddenly, it would leave the drill vulnerable.

2344
02:22:18,210 --> 02:22:19,690
Retirement account crashing...

2345
02:22:20,210 --> 02:22:22,370
So I've decided to invest in MinkyCoin.

2346
02:22:24,810 --> 02:22:27,290
Boo, one okay savings.

2347
02:22:27,570 --> 02:22:28,490
Let's go.

2348
02:22:35,640 --> 02:22:36,560
Oh, Brian.

2349
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,940
MinkyCoin is where it's at, baby.

2350
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:44,300
I'm telling my kids this was the XOF moment.

2351
02:22:45,340 --> 02:22:46,260
Wait, wait, wait.

2352
02:22:46,660 --> 02:22:47,140
Spoilers.

2353
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:49,260
Yeah, this is XOF.

2354
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:01,460
Please, have a think.

2355
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,060
See what you can do.

2356
02:23:04,380 --> 02:23:05,520
Okay, we're thinking.

2357
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:09,020
So we got new defenses here.

2358
02:23:09,500 --> 02:23:13,280
The defenses are operational, emitting a droning sound that grates at the ears.

2359
02:23:13,880 --> 02:23:15,480
You walk to the perimeter of the tower.

2360
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:18,240
One of the electrical panels hasn't been securely fastened.

2361
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:18,740
Open it.

2362
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:20,080
You open the panel.

2363
02:23:20,280 --> 02:23:25,340
Inside, a bundle of cables travels from a black box up to the heights of the tower.

2364
02:23:26,900 --> 02:23:32,580
The black box has a number of empty slots on the top, one of which has a module inserted into it.

2365
02:23:32,640 --> 02:23:33,400
It's labeled FLEE.

2366
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:38,460
Oh yeah, considering this is her invention, perhaps the researcher would have some advice.

2367
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:38,760
Okay.

2368
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:40,900
So we gotta change the frequency.

2369
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:43,240
From FLEE to...

2370
02:23:48,960 --> 02:23:50,620
Can it only be four-letter word?

2371
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:52,620
FLEE to...

2372
02:23:59,260 --> 02:23:59,760
Beat.

2373
02:24:02,020 --> 02:24:04,400
Minky coin investment, hopefully not a rug pull.

2374
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:05,800
Nope.

2375
02:24:07,480 --> 02:24:08,760
Minky coin, I'll buy three.

2376
02:24:09,980 --> 02:24:10,840
Thank you.

2377
02:24:12,620 --> 02:24:13,420
Date?

2378
02:24:13,900 --> 02:24:16,780
Oh my gosh, we're gonna date the tentacle monster.

2379
02:24:19,700 --> 02:24:20,500
Boob!

2380
02:24:20,500 --> 02:24:20,580
Boob!

2381
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:27,860
Oh,

2382
02:24:31,020 --> 02:24:32,220
because of our ship.

2383
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:37,280
I am the super special captain, yes.

2384
02:24:42,490 --> 02:24:44,130
Are you okay?

2385
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:55,090
What samples do you want now?

2386
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:01,410
Sea scorpion.

2387
02:25:02,230 --> 02:25:03,330
Okay, nice.

2388
02:25:05,210 --> 02:25:06,710
Open the stream in here, boob.

2389
02:25:08,150 --> 02:25:11,050
You've been here eleven months, Dan.

2390
02:25:11,610 --> 02:25:12,850
What else would you expect?

2391
02:25:16,490 --> 02:25:16,770
Okay.

2392
02:25:18,030 --> 02:25:19,310
I'm gonna undock.

2393
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:22,770
I'm gonna dock, because I'm gonna have it save.

2394
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:24,570
Then I'm gonna undock.

2395
02:25:25,150 --> 02:25:28,730
Alright, and what I wanna do before I end today's stream...

2396
02:25:28,730 --> 02:25:29,890
How long have I been streaming, anyway?

2397
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:32,870
Two and a half hours.

2398
02:25:32,950 --> 02:25:34,410
Sorry it's a bit shorter of a stream.

2399
02:25:35,630 --> 02:25:36,550
I'm just so sleepy.

2400
02:25:37,210 --> 02:25:40,210
I wanna go into the deep undock.

2401
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:45,130
To the edge of the map, yep.

2402
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:50,070
It's time to go north.

2403
02:25:51,930 --> 02:25:53,410
Into the unknown.

2404
02:25:56,230 --> 02:25:57,890
Into the unknown.

2405
02:26:00,350 --> 02:26:02,150
Into the unknown.

2406
02:26:04,610 --> 02:26:05,910
Oh, it's getting dark.

2407
02:26:06,030 --> 02:26:07,470
Oh, because it's night time.

2408
02:26:08,450 --> 02:26:10,070
Maybe I should sleep first.

2409
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:11,570
No.

2410
02:26:19,880 --> 02:26:21,160
We're fine, maybe.

2411
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:28,080
But I might need my light.

2412
02:26:34,930 --> 02:26:35,230
No.

2413
02:26:37,110 --> 02:26:37,590
No.

2414
02:26:39,750 --> 02:26:40,710
It's quiet.

2415
02:26:43,150 --> 02:26:43,930
What was that?

2416
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:45,470
Oh, we're starting to go crazy.

2417
02:26:48,830 --> 02:26:49,670
We're fine.

2418
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:51,790
I should've brought some tea with me.

2419
02:26:52,030 --> 02:26:53,810
It doesn't matter if I die here, though.

2420
02:26:54,390 --> 02:26:55,510
I don't quite mind it.

2421
02:26:56,370 --> 02:26:57,770
There's not even fish here, no?

2422
02:27:02,010 --> 02:27:03,290
That was fast.

2423
02:27:10,500 --> 02:27:14,620
Quit it.

2424
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:17,100
Right in front of me.

2425
02:27:18,840 --> 02:27:19,700
How far are we?

2426
02:27:20,440 --> 02:27:21,680
We're almost there.

2427
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:29,200
There's not even fish here.

2428
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:36,280
Almost there.

2429
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:40,900
Nothing's stopping us.

2430
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:02,260
We died!

2431
02:28:02,440 --> 02:28:02,840
Thanks for the

2432
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:09,550
game...

2433
02:28:18,880 --> 02:28:19,360
Maybe...

2434
02:28:19,360 --> 02:28:21,460
Going at night was a mistake, maybe.

2435
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:29,540
That's just an event, though, right?

2436
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:31,200
He's not actually coming for me?

2437
02:28:32,660 --> 02:28:34,080
I think that was just an event.

2438
02:28:49,480 --> 02:28:51,380
Not the instant karma!

2439
02:28:58,480 --> 02:29:00,400
Oh my goodness.

2440
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:01,440
That surprised me.

2441
02:29:02,080 --> 02:29:03,340
I'm too happy to continue.

2442
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:04,440
Good night, Leela!

2443
02:29:06,300 --> 02:29:07,240
It's okay.

2444
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:09,120
Load last save.

2445
02:29:10,940 --> 02:29:11,920
That was funny.

2446
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:13,640
That was so good!

2447
02:29:17,100 --> 02:29:18,940
We're pretty much done anyway.

2448
02:29:19,060 --> 02:29:20,220
I wanted to see what would happen.

2449
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:22,240
We got chomped.

2450
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:27,760
I thought it was just a little guy who was gonna be like...

2451
02:29:27,760 --> 02:29:28,600
Like before!

2452
02:29:28,780 --> 02:29:29,780
It's always been an event.

2453
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,980
No, we're gonna need a bigger boat.

2454
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,220
Silly note to end on.

2455
02:29:38,360 --> 02:29:41,380
We made a little bit of progress tonight, so that's good.

2456
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:44,740
That event had some real bite to it.

2457
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:57,340
JW!

2458
02:29:57,660 --> 02:29:59,180
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

2459
02:29:59,740 --> 02:30:00,420
Thank you!

2460
02:30:03,020 --> 02:30:05,320
I just wanna say this has been a very comfy stream.

2461
02:30:05,440 --> 02:30:06,800
Thanks for fishing and have a good eve.

2462
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:07,880
Thank you!

2463
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:10,840
I'll have my schedule up for the week.

2464
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:12,320
Probably tomorrow.

2465
02:30:15,640 --> 02:30:18,300
But thanks for fishing with me tonight, guys.

2466
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:24,740
Who knows, we'll maybe do another super long dredge stream this week or something.

2467
02:30:25,340 --> 02:30:26,520
Have you gone fishing IRL?

2468
02:30:26,860 --> 02:30:28,860
I don't think I have.

2469
02:30:29,380 --> 02:30:32,640
I think I've gone once before.

2470
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:34,560
Thanks for another dredge stream.

2471
02:30:34,700 --> 02:30:35,440
Thank you!

2472
02:30:35,440 --> 02:30:36,300
Thanks for making it.

2473
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:42,440
I feel I have maybe like once before, but I don't remember catching anything.

2474
02:30:48,140 --> 02:30:49,140
Maybe I should.

2475
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:51,880
I think I would catch the biggest fish in the pond.

2476
02:30:56,670 --> 02:30:57,970
But this was fun.

2477
02:30:58,870 --> 02:31:00,510
And I'm so sleepy.

2478
02:31:01,070 --> 02:31:02,370
So I'm gonna go to sleep.

2479
02:31:02,810 --> 02:31:06,110
And I suggest you guys get some rest as well.

2480
02:31:06,610 --> 02:31:07,790
Thank you guys for watching.

2481
02:31:07,970 --> 02:31:09,390
Thanks for hanging out with me.

2482
02:31:10,650 --> 02:31:12,470
I would catch a boot.

2483
02:31:13,490 --> 02:31:14,870
This is not Animal Crossing.

2484
02:31:17,450 --> 02:31:19,330
At least let me catch a can.

2485
02:31:19,730 --> 02:31:21,710
So I can sell it for some...

2486
02:31:21,710 --> 02:31:22,830
For like a quarter.

2487
02:31:25,550 --> 02:31:26,190
See ya, Minto.

2488
02:31:26,450 --> 02:31:27,090
See you!

2489
02:31:27,710 --> 02:31:28,750
Otsu... Minto!

2490
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,790
Itterasshoi!

2491
02:31:32,270 --> 02:31:32,990
Bye bye!

2492
02:31:33,090 --> 02:31:33,830
Thank you guys!

2493
02:31:34,330 --> 02:31:35,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2494
02:31:35,990 --> 02:31:36,890
Bye bye!

2495
02:31:37,210 --> 02:31:37,730
Good night!

2496
02:31:37,730 --> 02:31:38,210
Bye!
