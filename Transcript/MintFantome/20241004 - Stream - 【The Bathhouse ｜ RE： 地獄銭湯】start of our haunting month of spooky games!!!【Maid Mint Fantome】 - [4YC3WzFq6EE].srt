1
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:46,680
Oh!

2
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,780
Hello?

3
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,440
There we go.

4
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,160
Hello?

5
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,120
Welcome back!

6
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,940
Welcome back!

7
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,820
Hello?

8
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,660
Everybody.

9
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,280
Oh, I'm tired.

10
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,520
Right before this I played Pika Park.

11
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,820
And boy are my arms tired.

12
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,380
Oh.

13
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
I thought it was like a loop.

14
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,660
It is not.

15
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,420
A loop.

16
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,840
Yes!

17
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,280
If you didn't see that, I did not stream my POV.

18
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,700
You can check it out on DokiBird's channel.

19
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,800
She streamed it.

20
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,280
I don't know who else streamed it actually.

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,980
But um...

22
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,840
It's not a loop, it's a spiral.

23
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,850
Into madness?

24
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,030
Oh my goodness.

25
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,070
Yes.

26
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,250
Into madness!

27
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,090
We're spiraling!

28
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,190
We're spiraling!

29
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,330
Lime, Bao, Amelie, Snuffly.

30
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,450
Oh, for everybody else that streamed it?

31
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,050
There you go.

32
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:09,610
Yeah.

33
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,270
I figured since I was gonna...

34
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,430
I planned on doing this...

35
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,930
Well, actually...

36
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,350
Well, I wasn't sure what to do today.

37
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,210
But I was like, I wanna play a spooky game.

38
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,490
Cause it's Halloween!

39
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,010
It's Halloween!

40
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,830
It's Halloween!

41
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,910
I have to play...

42
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,430
At least one...

43
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,190
Or two...

44
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,830
Maybe three spooky games a week.

45
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:34,850
Until Halloween.

46
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,170
Yay!

47
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,440
But uh, today...

48
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,580
We're playing...

49
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,780
The Bath House.

50
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,820
Jigoku Sentou.

51
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,060
R-Ri...

52
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,320
The...

53
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,980
Redo.

54
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:53,480
Apparently, I guess...

55
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,520
The game broke?

56
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:56,660
And...

57
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,740
It's okay if I share something for you.

58
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,560
Wait, what do you mean by that nod?

59
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:01,980
I'm scared.

60
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,300
What do you mean by that?

61
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,700
We were all...

62
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,040
Busy yesterday with V-Day and 3.0 hype.

63
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,860
We didn't have the chance to say welcome back from Japan.

64
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,660
Hope you had a good trip home.

65
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,740
Thank you!

66
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,940
Oh, is it okay if I talk a little bit?

67
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,620
Except...

68
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,860
I don't wanna talk with like, this...

69
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Bathroom sound...

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,420
Behind me.

71
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,320
Maybe I should start the game and then talk.

72
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,580
I feel like I didn't get to tell any of my stories either.

73
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,780
Maybe we should yap for a bit.

74
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,500
Before we start the game.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,180
Happy 3rd of Halloween.

76
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,740
Yeah!

77
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,680
Oh!

78
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,680
It's not!

79
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,220
Oh my god.

80
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:39,960
Oh no!

81
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,760
I think Pico Park is considered psychological horror.

82
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,360
So true.

83
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,880
Happy birthday.

84
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:54,660
Yeah.

85
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
I wish a dream come true.

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,820
I hope we would really fly even further to the blue skies like a plane.

87
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,740
You're pretty good buddy.

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,300
Thank you so much Dan.

89
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,220
Oh my goodness.

90
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,520
Thank you.

91
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,040
Thank you.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,680
Thank you.

93
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,100
Thank you.

94
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,130
I was reading through messages yesterday.

95
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,610
It's from Super Chats and stuff.

96
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:29,840
So...

97
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,150
After stream and everything.

98
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,050
Thank you!

99
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,830
How much time...

100
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,370
Oh, time.

101
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,910
How much I could do for your birthday this year.

102
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:43,250
Contacted one of my artists and they published my $200.

103
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,390
$200!

104
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,710
Hashtag onlyfandomcommissionedforfree.

105
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,390
Thank you!

106
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,880
Oh my goodness.

107
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Thank you very much.

108
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,020
It's time for late birthday greetings.

109
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:11,960
I can't read at all.

110
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,700
Oh my goodness, I'm just inserting words everywhere.

111
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,380
Send me your spooky super chat for my spooky birthday!

112
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,000
Your spooky birthday?

113
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,180
Today?

114
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,460
My spooky birthday yesterday?

115
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,940
Not yesterday.

116
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,500
The day before yesterday.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,540
It's my Oshii's birthday two days ago.

118
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,040
Could you sign happy birthday for me?

119
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,760
Spank, thanks for the 20 gifted!

120
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,260
Kurustoke, let's go!

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,580
Yeah, they had to redo the whole story and everything for this, apparently.

122
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:46,160
I didn't even know that the game broke.

123
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
And Rainbow, thank you for the 20 gifted!

124
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,900
Thank you guys so much!

125
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

126
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,280
Uh...

127
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,340
Yeah, and they had to remake the whole game.

128
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,580
So I'm excited.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,900
It's actually been quite a while since I played the first bathhouse.

130
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,440
I don't remember so much about it, to be honest.

131
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,440
I don't remember... well, I remember some things about it.

132
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,760
I don't remember what the story was, so...

133
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,500
So it's a remake slash remaster.

134
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,260
I guess... kind of.

135
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,160
I'll double tap this just like Snake would.

136
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,340
I need to beat the runs, you big baby.

137
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:28,860
What do you mean?

138
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,620
What does this... what does... what does that even mean?

139
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,140
What did that mean?

140
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,940
Andragos, thanks for the 20 gifted!

141
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,500
Thank you!

142
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,440
I gave one gifted yesterday to agree with Matara that you're stinky.

143
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,940
I appreciate it.

144
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,240
Don't give in to Matara's lies.

145
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,820
You know what smells?

146
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,580
A bug.

147
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,220
You know what doesn't smell?

148
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,920
A person.

149
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,420
Or a ghost named Mint.

150
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,260
That smells fresh, right?

151
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,200
Just the... you know, you're just like...

152
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:10,220
You have the idea of... of a ghost and also minty freshness.

153
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,000
And you're like, ah, there's no way that could smell.

154
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,620
But a bug?

155
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,640
There's literal stink bugs.

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,740
It's like in the name.

157
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,740
I'd rather not.

158
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,960
Thank you so much for the 20 gifted!

159
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,900
Thank you!

160
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,570
Yeah.

161
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,290
There's no way that I could smell.

162
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:29,850
Or be stinky.

163
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,090
Maybe in personality.

164
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:36,070
Like, happy birthday, first talent, Pinto.

165
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:36,870
Thank you!

166
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:42,650
Let me know if the water sounds gets annoying, you know?

167
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,990
Just let me know while I'm talking.

168
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,290
Thank you!

169
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,490
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

170
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,970
If you don't stink, why the bathhouse?

171
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,330
Well, this is how we, you know, maintain our freshness.

172
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,130
By always going to the bathhouse.

173
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,550
Let's try 500 times.

174
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,450
Thank you!

175
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:01,690
Thank you!

176
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,870
Birthday dinner funds.

177
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,490
Thank you!

178
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,650
Oh my gosh, dad, please, stop donating!

179
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,870
Prayback, thanks for the 10 gifted!

180
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,430
Speedy fire, thanks for the 5 gifted!

181
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,320
Roaches have an incredible sense of smell.

182
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:22,960
They do?

183
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,080
I don't think so.

184
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,260
I only show up when they're stink.

185
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,740
Saku, didn't you say you were going to be gone for a while?

186
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,320
What is up with this?

187
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,940
Tika, thanks for the 10 gifted!

188
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,220
It's haunted because, you know what?

189
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,260
Someone broke the no-soap rule.

190
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,960
What's that?

191
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,340
Don't worry, I live.

192
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,000
Stop.

193
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,040
Oh my...

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,980
Oh, the no-soap-on-the-mountain rule!

195
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,940
Yeah, probably.

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,700
If you bring soap onto the mountain, you get stoned.

197
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,480
Ashen, thanks for the 5 gifted!

198
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,480
Oh my goodness, I feel like I'm just saying thank you over and over and over again.

199
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,320
I just finished a meeting.

200
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,340
I was getting ready to clock out, brat.

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,100
Yeah, so my Japan trip.

202
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,960
I think I...

203
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,660
I did a Twitter space.

204
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,780
Which should still be up, I believe.

205
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,220
That I talked about TGS.

206
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,040
I saw...

207
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,420
An Oshie I haven't seen in a long, long time.

208
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,440
Four years.

209
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,260
That I haven't seen her.

210
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
And she still remembered me.

211
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,060
I was really happy.

212
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,380
She like, saw me.

213
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,060
And she like, yelled my name.

214
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,780
And like...

215
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,800
And she's not...

216
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,620
She's not like, active anymore, right?

217
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,540
She like, retired, essentially.

218
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,220
So, there's not even a way for me to talk to her.

219
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,300
She wouldn't remember my name or anything.

220
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,120
Alright, thanks for the 5 gifted!

221
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,760
Oh my gosh, thank you for the 5th day gifted!

222
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,860
Thank you!

223
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,220
Very, very kind of you.

224
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,560
But...

225
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,640
I was really happy to see her.

226
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,500
Because...

227
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,440
I...

228
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,940
I have a cheki album.

229
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,780
She's actually the idol that I have the most chekis with out of anybody.

230
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,500
I loved her like...

231
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,220
Like, almost no one else.

232
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:25,760
I don't...

233
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,500
I don't call her my Kamioshi, because at the time I had a Kamioshi, but she had just recently...

234
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,100
Graduated and retired.

235
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,000
So...

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I was kind of in like an in-between phase, but if I wasn't in that in-between phase, she would definitely be my Kamiyoshi.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,120
And I have a checky book that's entirely filled with her.

238
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,660
Like, just... only... actually, it's overflowing now.

239
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,340
Because I got more checkies with her.

240
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,200
I got more pictures with her, so... with this chance.

241
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,940
So, were we talking about an idol that I really love?

242
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,680
She's been gone for a couple of years.

243
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,320
And so... the rebound?

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,120
Oh, she...

245
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,980
She wasn't, though.

246
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,140
Because she also was into that same idol that retired.

247
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,040
And it was one of the first things that kind of... like, made me like her.

248
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Because I was like, oh, if you like this idol, you have good taste.

249
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,360
And so I was just like, I will follow you.

250
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,560
And then, like, her...

251
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,360
Her... just personality.

252
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:41,760
She's literally one of the most unique idols I've ever... have ever, ever met.

253
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,580
Ever!

254
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:47,220
And the fact that she's not an idol anymore is just such a loss to the industry.

255
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,740
She is actually just so insanely unique.

256
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,080
And I just love her so much for that.

257
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,880
And... uh... um...

258
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,720
If I... maybe one day I'll post, like, one of her checkies.

259
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,640
Because her handwriting is just absolutely impossible to read.

260
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,340
What makes her unique?

261
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,480
She's... just actually just really wacky.

262
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,680
She had, like, a bouquet.

263
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,340
Oh my gosh.

264
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,700
Her checkie line took two hours.

265
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,300
Just because she was talking... she had... she's not with a company anymore.

266
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,360
So she had no limiters.

267
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,100
And so she was just talking to everyone for, like, five, ten minutes.

268
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,320
She was just going off.

269
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,280
She had a bouquet of flowers and she would shove them in people's faces during their pictures and stuff.

270
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,960
Who are we talking about?

271
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,520
Oh my gosh.

272
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,920
Sorry if people are coming in.

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,740
I'm talking about an idol that I met.

274
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,020
That I... one of my Oshis that I haven't met in four years.

275
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,580
So... yeah.

276
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,060
She... I just love her so much.

277
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,440
I love her so, so much.

278
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,040
Oh!

279
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,180
Oh!

280
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:56,840
There it is now!

281
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,160
Thank you!

282
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,440
Bring it... wait.

283
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,880
Let me bring it back to you.

284
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,500
YouTube doesn't allow me to do $500 for some reason.

285
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,060
Oh my gosh.

286
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,700
Thank you.

287
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,400
Thank you!

288
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,860
Thank you so much.

289
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,400
My goodness.

290
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,560
But yeah.

291
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,160
It was so great seeing her.

292
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,060
I actually didn't cry in front of her.

293
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,700
I thought I would.

294
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,360
I really thought I was gonna cry.

295
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,820
Because I kept tearing up in line.

296
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,380
But I think because I waited so long.

297
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,580
It all like sucked up back into my...

298
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,780
Into my spirit.

299
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,940
Real recognizes real.

300
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,260
And...

301
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,580
But yeah.

302
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,100
It was such... I'm so...

303
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,500
I know I took off a lot of time recently but...

304
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,560
Thank you guys for being patient with me and letting me go.

305
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,540
And...

306
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,940
Thanks to the tiny gifted.

307
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,080
And then I also watched my...

308
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,680
Other Oshii graduate.

309
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,100
And...

310
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,040
It was so sweet.

311
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,720
I cried a lot in front of her.

312
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,340
And...

313
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,920
I like... It was so sad.

314
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
I like get up to her.

315
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,160
And I sit down.

316
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,200
And I had like this whole speech prepared in my head.

317
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,760
And then she just goes...

318
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,200
She like...

319
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,620
You know...

320
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,600
Yells my name out.

321
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,500
And she's just like...

322
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,280
I waited for you.

323
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,900
And I just look at her.

324
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,560
And instead of speaking I just go...

325
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,460
That's the noise I make.

326
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,060
I go...

327
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,720
And then she goes...

328
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,140
And then she realizes I'm crying.

329
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:46,760
And...

330
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,620
And she like...

331
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,260
Starts talking for me.

332
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,120
And...

333
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,400
It was an immediate choke.

334
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,080
And...

335
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,540
She starts talking for me.

336
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,040
And...

337
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,220
Um...

338
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,120
Sorry.

339
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,900
I'm sad.

340
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,840
Maybe I shouldn't have talked about it.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,540
Um...

342
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,260
She just kind of was like...

343
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,680
Uh...

344
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,300
She was just like...

345
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:28,880
Come back to Japan.

346
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,180
Basically.

347
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,120
And like...

348
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,900
When I was...

349
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,200
When I was...

350
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,600
Uh...

351
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,340
It was my...

352
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,480
It was very short.

353
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,060
That we...

354
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,280
We didn't have a lot of time to talk.

355
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,860
Because there were so many people.

356
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,420
Obviously.

357
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,960
So they have to limit it a lot.

358
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,220
And uh...

359
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,600
She like grabbed my hand.

360
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,620
And was like...

361
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,000
Grasping my hand.

362
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,560
She was like...

363
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,000
Holding onto me really tightly.

364
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,560
And...

365
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,020
The person who like...

366
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,400
You know...

367
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,840
Kind of...

368
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,540
Me...

369
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:55,900
Like...

370
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,460
Facilitates the pictures and everything like that.

371
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,860
She was just like...

372
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,460
She was like...

373
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,080
Okay.

374
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,640
It's time.

375
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,480
Okay.

376
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:03,940
It's time.

377
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,540
Okay.

378
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:04,880
It's time.

379
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,920
And so I'm trying to leave.

380
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,820
And she's...

381
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,540
She's pulling me back.

382
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,920
And she's just like...

383
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,300
Come back!

384
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
Come back to Japan!

385
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,480
And the...

386
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
And the person...

387
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,860
Had to literally like...

388
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,320
Karate chop our hands.

389
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,020
She was like...

390
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,220
It!

391
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,380
She was like...

392
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,140
Chikan desu!

393
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,140
It was so cute.

394
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,420
Uh...

395
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,820
Um...

396
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
And she like...

397
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,460
Karate chopped us.

398
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,140
And I was like...

399
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:37,380
Uh...

400
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,460
Yeah.

401
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,140
I love my Oshii.

402
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,200
I love my...

403
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,720
Chikan?

404
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,100
No!

405
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,460
Ji!

406
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,520
Jiikan!

407
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,790
But um...

408
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,250
Yeah.

409
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,490
And uh...

410
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,290
Oh my gosh!

411
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,030
Um...

412
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,630
The last day I was in Japan was my birthday.

413
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,970
So October 1st.

414
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:08,850
And...

415
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,830
I went to go see the billboards in Akihabara.

416
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,110
And then...

417
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,570
I was like...

418
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,610
Well I'm in Akihabara.

419
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,970
And you know what?

420
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:20,390
You know what they said?

421
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,250
Metal Gear...

422
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,570
John Metal Gear said...

423
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,110
Starting in October...

424
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,770
In arcades all around Japan...

425
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,390
There's gonna be the Metal Gear...

426
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,610
The Metal Gear...

427
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:34,630
Um...

428
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,050
Stuff in the Crane games.

429
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,750
And I was like...

430
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:38,850
What?

431
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,650
Yeah!

432
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,530
So...

433
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,330
Basically...

434
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,450
I...

435
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,190
I was like...

436
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,350
Well I'm gonna be in Akihabara anyway.

437
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,690
For the billboards.

438
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,490
And I went early.

439
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,630
And I waited.

440
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:53,790
For the arcades to open.

441
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,850
I sat outside the arcades.

442
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,590
And I waited.

443
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,610
I waited.

444
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:58,090
And I waited.

445
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:58,650
And I waited.

446
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,170
And I waited.

447
00:19:59,250 --> 00:19:59,650
And I waited.

448
00:19:59,730 --> 00:19:59,990
And I waited.

449
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,610
And I was just like...

450
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:00,770
Okay.

451
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,090
I'm gonna be the first one in there.

452
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,590
I'm gonna be...

453
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,270
Looking around.

454
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,210
I'm gonna be searching everywhere...

455
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,070
For...

456
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,870
For...

457
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,850
Metal Gear games.

458
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,290
For the Crane games.

459
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,470
And guys...

460
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,830
I went to every...

461
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:14,270
Arcade...

462
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,530
In Akihabara.

463
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,110
And they lied.

464
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,690
Starting in October...

465
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,650
My butt!

466
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,190
I got my hopes up.

467
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,530
I was so excited.

468
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,730
I was just like...

469
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm gonna go.

470
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:26,970
I'm gonna go.

471
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,390
I'm gonna go.

472
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:27,730
I'm gonna go.

473
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,610
They said starting October.

474
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,690
They didn't need to give a date.

475
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,810
But they said October.

476
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,650
So I was like...

477
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,730
Maybe October 1st.

478
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:33,990
They said starting October.

479
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,110
They did not give a date.

480
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:37,950
They lied.

481
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:38,850
They lied.

482
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,030
They lied.

483
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,910
They didn't give a date.

484
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,850
They just said starting October.

485
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,070
That they would be in the Crane games.

486
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,110
And so I was like...

487
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,630
I know it's October 1st.

488
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,110
But maybe.

489
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,290
Maybe.

490
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,810
My little heart pleaded.

491
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,290
I was like...

492
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:52,630
Please.

493
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:52,950
Please.

494
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,210
Please.

495
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,550
Please.

496
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,190
Please.

497
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:54,970
It's October.

498
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,290
And then...

499
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:57,470
Yeah.

500
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,110
I got played like a damn fiddle.

501
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:01,270
So angry.

502
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,060
Liable for psychological damage.

503
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm so angry.

504
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,300
Yeah.

505
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,540
It was a big bummer.

506
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,380
I'm not gonna lie.

507
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,280
I was actually...

508
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,020
Because I was...

509
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,980
I was running to different arcade...

510
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,400
Like...

511
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,120
Arcades in Akiba.

512
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,120
And maybe I should have gone outside of Akiba.

513
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:23,740
But...

514
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,200
I didn't wanna like...

515
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,060
Go too far.

516
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,940
I had my stuff.

517
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,600
And...

518
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,660
I wanted to...

519
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,180
I had to see the billboards and everything.

520
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,160
So...

521
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,860
Like...

522
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,440
Akiba has so many arcade...

523
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,320
Arcades.

524
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,780
I can't...

525
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:40,960
I can't...

526
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,680
I keep saying arcade games.

527
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,740
They have so many arcades.

528
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,860
So I was like...

529
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,320
Maybe I should go to Ikebukuro.

530
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:46,940
I don't know.

531
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,480
But...

532
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,880
Not even on like the...

533
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,360
Sometimes...

534
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:53,200
Arcades will have like a little poster that shows like future...

535
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,200
Future items that are coming to crane games.

536
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,960
And they didn't even have it on there.

537
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,460
So I'm like...

538
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,320
I was so angry.

539
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,260
Okay.

540
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:08,460
Yeah.

541
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,100
That's enough of me yapping, I think.

542
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:10,960
Okay.

543
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,360
I'm going to have to buy it all in Mercari.

544
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,080
Marked up.

545
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,140
I'm going to buy from the scalpers.

546
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:21,800
Nooo.

547
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,860
But honestly...

548
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,800
I think they'll probably be...

549
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,420
Or rather...

550
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,300
I feel like they should be reasonably priced.

551
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,200
I feel like they would probably be the amount that I would have paid just trying to get it out of the machines myself.

552
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,100
Because I'm not very good with them.

553
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,960
I'm not very good with them.

554
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
Wishing you get the cardboard box plushie.

555
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,780
I need it!

556
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,660
What proxy do you use?

557
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,620
I use Baii.

558
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,620
I just use Baii.

559
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,200
Like I order the stuff myself.

560
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,200
And I have no more Japan trips until the end of the year.

561
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,560
Which is another idle graduation.

562
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,540
That's just my afterlife recently.

563
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,360
So sad.

564
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,280
Happy belated birthday, Minto!

565
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,380
Just watched yesterday's VOD.

566
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,660
Very funny, especially the ads.

567
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,760
Is there going to be a version B for 3.0?

568
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,580
Version B?

569
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,440
What do you mean by that?

570
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,380
Version B?

571
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,660
Yesterday was so packed with pika I actually forgot to say this.

572
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,100
I hope she dies.

573
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:40,480
Let's go!

574
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,500
Death day?

575
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:42,980
Yeah.

576
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,800
I get it.

577
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,320
Please upload your ad so I can loop the Haters song.

578
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,860
Haters!

579
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:51,780
Spicy.

580
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:54,520
Oh!

581
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,680
Actually...

582
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,020
Uh...

583
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:04,400
My mama made my panties kinda spicy.

584
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,040
Hahaha.

585
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,140
Originally...

586
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Originally, my mama was like...

587
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,040
What if I just put... What if I just use band-aids?

588
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,860
But I think... I think it would scare the rigger.

589
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,420
They would be like, Whoa!

590
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,760
Band-aids!

591
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,140
So, um...

592
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,220
You know...

593
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,280
Would you ever consider moving to Japan?

594
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,240
No, not really.

595
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,920
I don't think I'd want to.

596
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,120
Yeah, my mama's kind of awesome.

597
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,670
And you have at least a bandage toggle.

598
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,890
I'm gonna RTA getting banned from YouTube.

599
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,830
We kept joking about that actually.

600
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,410
We were like...

601
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,130
We would suggest something and then we'd be like...

602
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,210
Oh yeah, that would get banned from YouTube for sure.

603
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,370
Then I would suggest something...

604
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,150
Oh yeah, that would get banned from YouTube for sure.

605
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,870
We just kept saying things that would get me banned.

606
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,390
Thanks for the membership from yesterday!

607
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:17,770
Yippee!

608
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,320
Thanks mama.

609
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,260
So true!

610
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,340
Band-aid emote!

611
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,340
No!

612
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,980
But...

613
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,380
Once you see my reference sheet, maybe you'll be like...

614
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,860
Whoa!

615
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:43,940
Whoa!

616
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,420
They're cute panties though.

617
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,640
It's a little different from now since Maya kinda gave me a leotard, but it's a little different now.

618
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,220
You hear that artist take paper.

619
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,480
Who needs clothes when you have a box?

620
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,340
So true!

621
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:22,310
I'm not giving you any more hints than what I've told you.

622
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,410
No more hints.

623
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,690
No more hints.

624
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:30,630
That's it.

625
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:36,610
Would you jump for the chicken or the beef?

626
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,530
I don't know!

627
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,630
I haven't watched the Civ thing yet!

628
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,690
I don't know!

629
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,810
I haven't watched that yet.

630
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:47,770
I literally only found out about it like... this morning.

631
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,510
Two things for the Super Chat.

632
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,790
Plays.

633
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:55,470
At least you're polite about it.

634
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,370
Answer from the heart.

635
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,210
I think I prefer beef over chicken.

636
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,730
So I might actually go for the beef.

637
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:11,970
How's the TGS vlog?

638
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,410
Oh, I haven't started on it yet.

639
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,930
Actually, I'm really worried about it.

640
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:19,130
Because I was having issues with my camera.

641
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,010
I should've just bought a new camera, man!

642
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,230
I have an old Osmo... like the original Osmo Pocket.

643
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:30,650
And, um... I got... I brought... so I brought that.

644
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,590
And, uh...

645
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,870
Every time I would turn it on... well, not every time, but a lot of the times when I would turn it on...

646
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,450
It wouldn't let me film because it would be like, SD card needs formatting.

647
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,010
And I'm like...

648
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,390
What?

649
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,650
I would be like, does... is this...

650
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,730
Is this saving what I'm recording?

651
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:53,450
So I'm actually quite worried.

652
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,170
Maybe I should've just used my phone.

653
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,130
I don't know!

654
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,830
Thanks for suggesting Jam and Akiba.

655
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,770
First time in Japan last week and it was a chill choice for my not-so-daring friends.

656
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,350
Oh!

657
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,130
I'm glad!

658
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,530
I'm glad you like it.

659
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,090
I love Jam.

660
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:05,950
It's so awesome.

661
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,170
And the same problem RLM had their most...

662
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:10,570
Oh my gosh!

663
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:13,830
I'm obsessed with the most recent Red Letter Media video.

664
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:14,830
Oh my gosh!

665
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,970
I'm so obsessed.

666
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:18,410
Of course, my Oshii win.

667
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:19,450
Ghost hunting.

668
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:22,090
I love Mike's classes so much.

669
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,110
I love that video.

670
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:33,710
But then... I saw... actually when I was at the airport...

671
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,670
They had a... what's it called?

672
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:41,910
They have a big camera... a small big camera in the airport.

673
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,990
And I always kind of like go and look at some of like the stuff.

674
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,790
I'm late.

675
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:46,870
Did you play the game?

676
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:47,210
No.

677
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,630
Yeah, I beat the game in 30 minutes.

678
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:51,750
No, no, no.

679
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:52,450
I haven't started.

680
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:52,770
Sorry.

681
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,530
I'm yapping too much because I didn't get to yap yesterday.

682
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,030
I'm sorry.

683
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,670
But I saw this one camera called the PowerShot V10.

684
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,850
I'm gonna look into it if anybody knows anything about it.

685
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,270
But it's kind of what I wanted.

686
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:12,310
So I might get it and use it for future stuff.

687
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,310
It's kind of expensive.

688
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,130
Well, actually...

689
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,050
I wonder how much it is.

690
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:22,270
I wonder how much it is in dollar.

691
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,130
Well, that's the thing.

692
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:35,650
If I turned it off and left it off for a little while...

693
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,310
And then turned it back on, it would be fine.

694
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,190
And then...

695
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,590
If I turned it back on...

696
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,210
If I turned the camera on back too quickly...

697
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:46,130
It would say it needs formatting.

698
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,070
So...

699
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,010
I got footage on it.

700
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,530
I think.

701
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:54,210
I would check.

702
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,570
I would be like, it keeps saying it needs formatting.

703
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:00,770
But you know how you can review the stuff that you filmed.

704
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,370
It was all still on there.

705
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,210
So I'm like...

706
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,770
Maybe, yeah, maybe faulty SD card.

707
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,150
I did switch it out for another SD card.

708
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:13,670
And it was fine.

709
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:14,690
After...

710
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,530
I should have done that from the first time it happened.

711
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:17,950
But you know...

712
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,270
Even in death, you still learn.

713
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,550
Yeah, so...

714
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:32,630
Yeah, I have an SD card reader on my PC.

715
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,450
All good.

716
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:39,530
Cool.

717
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:41,350
Are you ready to play the bathhouse?

718
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,690
Are you guys ready?

719
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,410
I don't know.

720
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,850
I don't really have anything else.

721
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,930
Any other pictures or anything?

722
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,410
Or I have pictures.

723
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,230
But I don't think I really have any other stories.

724
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:00,050
Yeah.

725
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,850
Yeah, this is a game stream.

726
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,250
Okay.

727
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,450
New game.

728
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,690
Yeah, I don't...

729
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,110
I don't have a game.

730
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,550
It's only continue because...

731
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,930
I started it.

732
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,530
So I could change the settings to not be so high quality.

733
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,170
Okay.

734
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,430
TV table turn.

735
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,570
Thanks for the turning off turn.

736
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,290
Thanks for yappa yappa.

737
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,270
A week ago.

738
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,330
Okay.

739
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,210
Thank you for your hard work today.

740
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,070
Thank you for your hard work.

741
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,850
Today is the cleaning of the sauna.

742
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:31,750
Oh, no.

743
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,070
I'm cleaning the sauna.

744
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,830
There is a bucket in the cleaning room.

745
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,150
Please collect the towel.

746
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,570
Oh, there's a bucket in the cleaning supplies closet.

747
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,570
Collect the towels and put them in the bucket.

748
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,670
Oh, okay.

749
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,380
How do I get out of here?

758
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,760
Oh, oh.

I get it.

760
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:22,620
I get it.

761
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:22,780
Okay.

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,440
But then after six...

769
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,600
Okay.

770
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,720

I don't think it's even possible.

778
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,020
Do not run.

779
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,780

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,780

Wait, so under 7?

790
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,720
Wait, so, but why do you have to be under 6?

791
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,660
Or up to 6?

792
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,320
Okay.

793
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,740
It's a bit sad.

794
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,240
Oh my god, it's saying...

795
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,300
I'll take that.

796
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,340
Oh, oh, what's this?

797
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,920
Job description.

798
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,760
Maybe that should be behind the counter.

799
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,360
6 is under 7.

800
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,240
Yeah?

801
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:05,180
But wouldn't it be free and also able to go into any bath in like the same category?

802
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,220
I don't know.

803
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,940
Turn away customers who don't follow the rules.

804
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:09,760

806
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,760

810
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,680
Those are my duties.

811
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,880
Oh, here we go.

812
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,660
Okay.

813
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,480
Again, I really don't remember how this used to look.

814
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,020
I can't.

815
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,920
This is the hardest fabric I've ever...

816
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:42,940
Oh, God.

817
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,020
Oh, God.

818
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,780
It's so stiff.

819
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,680
I can't get out.

820
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:50,800
Wait, is this the...

821
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,080
Is this the bathroom?

822
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,540
I thought this was the entrance.

823
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,000
No, this is the entrance, right?

824
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,820
Yeah, this is the entrance.

825
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,060
I'm not trying to take a peek.

826
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,240
I'm no pervert.

827
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,260
I mean, not here at least.

828
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,280
Oh, what have we got to drink?

829
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,960
It won't let me crouch.

830
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,940
We got the Ichigo milk.

831
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,980
I'm guessing that's the...

832
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,600
We got fruits.

833
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,780
We got kohe.

834
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,260
We got the gyunyu.

835
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,520
Ice cream.

836
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,780
Did anybody else do that?

837
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,540
Oh, gosh.

838
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,520
I turned it down to high, but hopefully I don't have to turn it down so much more.

839
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,380
Oh, my goodness.

840
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,840
Why is there like an ambience?

841
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, God!

842
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:40,900
Why is this?

843
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,960
Oh, it's a horror movie advertisement.

844
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,640
Oh, it's a horror movie advertisement.

845
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,060
What the hell?

846
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,180
Oh.

847
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:55,650
Oh,

848
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:00,570
sorry.

849
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:01,730
The things are kind of delayed.

850
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,850
Okay, here's the closet with our bucket.

851
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,070
Okay, here's the closet with our bucket.

852
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,390
Not here.

853
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:07,850
Okay.

854
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,310
Not here.

855
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:08,310
Okay.

856
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,390
You.

857
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,220
It looks good.

858
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,540
I don't remember it looking this good as before.

859
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,200
Maybe I'm just crazy, though.

860
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,920
I do feel like they're getting better with their games.

861
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,340
They're still kusoge.

862
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,360
But this does look pretty good.

863
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,320
What am I supposed to clean?

864
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,180
He said grab a bucket and do what?

865
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:43,130
Here?

866
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,350
Oh!

867
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,570
Oh, the towels!

868
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,710
Oh, God!

869
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:48,410
Oh, my God!

870
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,790
Oh, my God!

871
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,950
Molly.

872
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,090
I'm scared.

873
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,210
She's gonna be standing out there, isn't she?

874
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:10,530
Should I leave or...

875
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,060
Yuck.

876
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:21,540
Oh.

877
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,200
No cutting your hair in the bathtub.

878
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:25,780
Oh,

879
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,780
my God!

880
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,500
That was the loudest thing ever!

881
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:42,700
Please!

882
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,780
Holy shit!

883
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,740
Is that my phone?

884
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,940
I'm living on the edge, for real.

885
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,140
Game!

886
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,020
Oh.

887
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,460
Ghost phone.

888
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,220
Moshi moshi!

889
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,080
Audio balance is crazy.

890
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,680
I'm so sorry, you guys.

891
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,420
My goodness.

892
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,280
Hello?

893
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,520
It's been a while.

894
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:14,920
Yes.

895
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,040
It's been since the graduation from the orphanage.

896
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,080
Is everyone doing well?

897
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,340
I'm gonna put it down to like half sound.

898
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,440
Oh, me?

899
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,460
Yes.

900
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,640
Um...

901
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,580
Huh?

902
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,540
This is such a riveting conversation.

903
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,680
Yes.

904
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,620
Oh, is that so?

905
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,340
Okay.

906
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,080
I see.

907
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,660
What?

908
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,800
I learned so much from that!

909
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:53,960
You know, sometimes it's good to like just talk out what's going on for the sake of the viewer.

910
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,320
I received a message from the facility.

911
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,740
Who is the facility?

912
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,500
It's from someone who knows me.

913
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,720
They're asking me to come work at their bathhouse.

914
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,800
They also said I can live in an apartment that they own.

915
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,040
It seems like the bathhouse is located in the countryside.

916
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,760
It seems like the bathhouse is located in the countryside.

917
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,320
It doesn't fit well in this whole city life.

918
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Maybe I should go.

919
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,800
Hi, ball boy!

920
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,560
Thanks for the gift.

921
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,800
Thank you.

922
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,560
I'm lagging a little bit.

923
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,200
It's raining heavily.

924
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,400
And it's lagging heavily.

925
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,360
I need to hurry and get to the apartment.

926
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,940
It seems my new room will be room 202.

927
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,680
Oh, I can run.

928
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,440
Oh, that makes me feel good.

929
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,500
Vtuber?

930
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:41,660
Vtuber?

931
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,180
How did we get through here?

932
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,900
If we're not allowed through.

933
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,080
Most wanted.

934
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:53,980
Five?

935
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,500
Five what?

936
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,180
Height 180cm.

937
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,200
Description, slim build, short hair.

938
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
Toru Maruhisa.

939
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,220
23 years old.

940
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,640
If you recognize this person, please contact Goku!

941
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,400
Goku really?

942
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:11,800
Real estate.

943
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,000
Goku is after you, my guy.

944
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,900
You're in trouble.

945
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,040
You are so in trouble.

946
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,620
You'll never make it.

947
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,800
Grandma.

948
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,980
Oh, I don't think that's grandma.

949
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,460
Sorry.

950
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
I thought it was a really hunched lady.

951
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,320
Not here.

952
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,780
My place is room 202.

953
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,200
Chief.

954
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,200
Oh my god.

955
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,400
This is Sayuriya.

956
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,100
Movie again.

957
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,560
Is this a real movie?

958
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,340
Is this a short cut?

959
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,760
Here's all the...

960
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,560
The supporter people.

961
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,980
Vtubers and stuff.

962
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,820
Bing bong.

963
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,100
What the hell is that?

964
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,380
Did you guys hear that?

965
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,240
It was like laughing.

966
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:27,240
A bird?

967
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,000
A plane?

968
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,200
Oh, now I can crouch.

969
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,780
I like seeing all these.

970
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,800
They're always so fun.

971
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:44,960
Hmm.

972
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,780
I wonder if they're the supporters from the original game or not, you know?

973
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,600
Secret Vtuber.

974
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,740
Hahaha.

975
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:54,840
Hahaha.

976
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,220
Secret.

977
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,200
Okay.

978
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,240
We gotta hurry.

979
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,600
Yeah, I'd assume from the original, right?

980
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,060
Oh my god, a monkey!

981
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,320
A monkey!

982
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,400
Monkey?

983
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,960
Is that what I heard before?

984
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,390
I thought so.

985
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,250
I don't...

986
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:36,730
Okay.

987
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,370
Oh.

988
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:41,170
There's a monkey in my apartment.

989
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,480
Okay.

990
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,160
I'm room 202.

991
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,280
But before we do that, we're gonna explore just a tad.

992
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:53,400
Oh, Vtuber.

993
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,620
Number 16.

994
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,260
Number 16.

995
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,240
Vtuber.

996
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,340
Oh, number 1!

997
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,180
Is it?

998
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,300
Oh my god!

999
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,880
Number 5.

1000
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,580
Number 1?

1001
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,860
Again?

1002
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,600
They're hidden amongst the leaves.

1003
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,440
The Vtubers are hidden among us?

1004
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,060
Hahaha.

1005
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,480
Hello.

1006
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:23,860
Hmm.

1007
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,000
Slim build.

1008
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,760
Short hair.

1009
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,580
Nah, you sure look sussy.

1010
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,360
Oh!

1011
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,140
Number 6.

1012
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,120
Suss.

1013
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:38,580
Oh!

1014
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:38,920
Oh!

1015
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,400
I missed one.

1016
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,740
Oh, these are so random.

1017
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,060
Randomly placed.

1018
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,360
Oh, I found another one!

1019
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,400
Number 4!

1020
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,800
Quick, call Goku.

1021
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,780
I have him on speed dial.

1022
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,320
Beep boop bop beep beep.

1023
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,260
Goku?

1024
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,640
Is my neighbor a freak?

1025
00:43:59,220 --> 00:43:59,980
Ping pong!

1026
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:03,860
Huh?

1027
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,780
They told me that it would be unlocked.

1028
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:09,940
Uh...

1029
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,580
Oh!

1030
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,500
I see one right there.

1031
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,200
Who's leaving all these little stickers?

1032
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,240
I don't have an inventory to call.

1033
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,760
I can't ping pong?

1034
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,500
Oh, my god!

1035
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,260
Oh, my god!

1036
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,420
Hello!

1037
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,540
Hello.

1038
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,320
You're Maina-san, right?

1039
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,200
Welcome.

1040
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,880
Thank you for coming.

1041
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,100
Thank you for coming.

1042
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,260
Oh, the bath house is right across from this apartment.

1043
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,900
Oh, the bath house is right across from this apartment.

1044
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,400
Oh, the bath house is right across from this apartment.

1045
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,060
Very easy to commute, right?

1046
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,160
Oh, I see.

1047
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,940
This room will be room 202.

1048
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,660
It's like eyebrows are twitching.

1049
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,600
Your room will be room 202.

1050
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,620
It's a bit old, but the interior is pretty nice.

1051
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,420
Oh, okay.

1052
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,540
It's a bit old, but the interior is nice.

1053
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,820
Alright, okay.

1054
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,920
Uh...

1055
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,020
Maina-san, are you 24 now?

1056
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:17,240
Uh...

1057
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,300
You're 24 years old right now.

1058
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,300
Uh...

1059
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:22,900
Yeah...

1060
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:28,380
I'll be turning 24 in three days.

1061
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,180
No, I'm still 23.

1062
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,940
Gosh, rude!

1063
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:40,100
I'm in my prime!

1064
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,360
Oh, really?

1065
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,120
Still 23, huh?

1066
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:51,360
I'm glad someone young came to help.

1067
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,920
I'm glad someone young came to help.

1068
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,360
Oh!

1069
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:54,860
Alright, then.

1070
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:56,100
Oh!

1071
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,600
Here's your key.

1072
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:00,160
When you're ready, come to the bathhouse.

1073
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,840
Thank you!

1074
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,600
Where is he gonna go?

1075
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:05,900
Oh!

1076
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,760
Where is he gonna go?

1077
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:10,580
Oh!

1078
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,980
I don't think he likes that I'm following him.

1079
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,140
Where are you gonna go?

1080
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:19,940
Oh!

1081
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,760
Go away!

1082
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,680
Yep.

1083
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,100
I'm ready for the bathhouse!

1084
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,040
I'm ready for the bathhouse!

1085
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,200
Does nobody drive here?

1086
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:29,640
Like...

1087
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,280
Oh!

1088
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,320
Oh, okay.

1089
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:34,780
Oh!

1090
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,520
Alright.

1091
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,390
Oh, it's the supermarket, even.

1092
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,590
It's all boarded up, though.

1093
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,090
Doesn't...

1094
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,390
Oh, whoops.

1095
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:49,630
202.

1096
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,170
Doesn't look like it's that late.

1097
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:53,750
Doesn't look like it's that late.

1098
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,680
It looks like I'm actually holding a key.

1099
00:46:59,740 --> 00:46:59,940
Oh!

1100
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,060
Nice inside?

1101
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:02,800
Where?

1102
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:04,860
Oh my god.

1103
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,900
Oh no.

1104
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,640
Nice inside?

1105
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,060
Oh my god!

1106
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,540
It's so dark.

1107
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,080
Put my stuff down.

1108
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:24,050
That's all I brought?

1109
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:28,590
Can you imagine the futon?

1110
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:29,610
What is this?

1111
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,270
Okay.

1112
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:34,830
Nice.

1113
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:35,670
Weepy!

1114
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:39,110
Am I supposed to hold it?

1115
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,250
I'm supposed to hold it.

1116
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:43,570
Oh.

1117
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:46,210
He said the room is clean.

1118
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,090
There's a scratch mark.

1119
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:53,250
Where?

1120
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,410
Is that money?

1121
00:47:55,950 --> 00:47:56,690
Let's go.

1122
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:02,360
Okay.

1123
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:03,780
What?

1124
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:04,940
A scratch mark in here?

1125
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,160
Where can I put this?

1126
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,540
I don't want to hold it right now.

1127
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,280
Unequip.

1128
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:12,780
There we go.

1129
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,200
On the floor?

1130
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:17,840
Oh, this?

1131
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:20,560
Hmm.

1132
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,680
It looks like it was dragged right here.

1133
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,120
Ah, yeah.

1134
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,460
I feel really at home.

1135
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,360
Look, there's even a TV.

1136
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,200
This is actually...

1137
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,140
This is the nicest part.

1138
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:43,660
It actually looks like a brand new TV and brand new like little entertainment center.

1139
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,580
It's actually...

1140
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,740
This is the nice part.

1141
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:49,100
Yeah, what's this placement though?

1142
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,020
I'm a vampire?

1143
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,940
I'm a vampire.

1144
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,120
Yeah.

1145
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,520
Sniff the tatami mats.

1146
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,560
You do it first.

1147
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,840
You do it first.

1148
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:12,760
Hmm.

1149
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,500
I can't feel it.

1150
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:16,960
Where else?

1151
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,960
I mean, we could put this anywhere else.

1152
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,420
Like, move this over.

1153
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,520
You could put it right here.

1154
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,120
You know?

1155
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:25,820
Like...

1156
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,840
Actually, there is no closet.

1157
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,160
I thought this was a closet for a second, but this is a slidey door.

1158
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,560
This is our closet.

1159
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,560
No you.

1160
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,260
No you!

1161
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:42,120
But this area kind of terrifies me.

1162
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,000
The kitchen is...

1163
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,200
The kitchen is actually very spacious.

1164
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,860
And then that's probably our toilet.

1165
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,460
Which I'm glad that we have even a...

1166
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,360
I guess it's good that we have a toilet in our place.

1167
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:04,180
Some places don't have... Some places have like a shared toilet, which is my greatest nightmare.

1168
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:06,580
Oh!

1169
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,420
Number four.

1170
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,290
Number fourteen.

1171
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:17,070
These... I think I saw number fourteen before.

1172
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:20,330
Yeah, it sounds horrible, right?

1173
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:21,910
Where was the trash again?

1174
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:23,730
Hello?

1175
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:26,470
What if I left it in front of your door?

1176
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,550
Oh!

1177
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:30,550
See?

1178
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,710
But that's our third number one!

1179
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:35,010
Not everybody can be number one!

1180
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,250
This makes no sense!

1181
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,160
Give it to the monkey.

1182
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,360
Where's the trash?

1183
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,780
Oh, here.

1184
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,210
Take out trash on day one.

1185
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,290
Oh.

1186
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,650
I...

1187
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,110
Here.

1188
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:10,410
Um...

1189
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:14,310
This stuff always messes me up.

1190
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:19,210
So every... Basically every Tuesday and Friday is the burnable garbage.

1191
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:23,410
Every Thursday is the non-burnable garbage.

1192
00:51:25,030 --> 00:51:26,630
For, uh...

1193
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,090
Uh, what's a bin?

1194
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,010
Like, um...

1195
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,310
Uh, like a bottle and cans and, and like the, um...

1196
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,990
pet bottles and everything.

1197
00:51:36,190 --> 00:51:38,050
Like, like water bottles and stuff.

1198
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,650
That's on Wednesdays.

1199
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:40,590
Plastic.

1200
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:44,950
Plastic is two times a month.

1201
00:51:45,130 --> 00:51:49,290
So these ones are every week, uh, every, like um, every week.

1202
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,250
And these ones are two times a month on Mondays.

1203
00:51:51,430 --> 00:52:00,410
And this is the, like, the um, cardboard is uh, three times a month on Saturday.

1204
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:04,230
This is actually how things are.

1205
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:05,470
It's so confusing.

1206
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:11,010
Because sometimes I'm like, I don't even know what's what's a and then also it's just like

1207
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:16,130
Oh!

1208
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:17,570
Plastic is second... Yes!

1209
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:18,130
Sorry.

1210
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:18,830
Yes, you're right.

1211
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:20,410
It's not two times a month.

1212
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:20,970
Second Monday.

1213
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:21,730
Third Monday.

1214
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,570
Or third Saturday.

1215
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,870
Yeah.

1216
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:25,850
Thank you, Popman!

1217
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:26,670
Thank you, Josh.

1218
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,650
Thank you, thank you.

1219
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:28,510
Camera funds.

1220
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:36,550
But it's so confusing because sometimes I'll get something and I'll be like I don't...

1221
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,350
I don't know.

1222
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:41,250
I don't know.

1223
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:49,390
Everything is burnable when it's hot enough.

1224
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,350
So true.

1225
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:54,190
Yeah.

1226
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:54,970
I don't know.

1227
00:52:55,150 --> 00:52:55,630
Okay.

1228
00:52:57,350 --> 00:52:58,810
We got work to do.

1229
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,910
Your hotels don't have... No, not like a hotel when I lived in an apartment.

1230
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:05,490
Hello, sir.

1231
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,630
You're here.

1232
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:10,850
You're here.

1233
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:11,330
You're here.

1234
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:16,250
Luckily, a lot of apartment places will... Oh my gosh.

1235
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,690
I'm lagging so bad.

1236
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:28,110
But luckily, a lot of apartments will give you like a What's the word?

1237
00:53:28,370 --> 00:53:29,390
Like a picture guide.

1238
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,210
Why does the game get to look so nice and I get to look so bad?

1239
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,190
Yeah.

1240
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:36,090
I'll turn the V -sync on.

1241
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:36,750
Should I turn it off?

1242
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:43,280
From today, you will be working at this bathhouse.

1243
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,200
From today, you will be working at this bathhouse.

1244
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,260
I'll explain what you will be doing.

1245
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,040
For now, get behind the reception desk.

1246
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,720
For now, get behind the reception desk.

1247
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,620
For now, get behind the reception desk.

1248
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:01,080
Let's see if it helps.

1249
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:01,580
Oh.

1250
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,240
Oh.

1251
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,260
Oh.

1252
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,240
Not even a little bit?

1253
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:20,470
Nope.

1254
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,070
Nope.

1255
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:22,210
Nope.

1256
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,230
It's fine.

1257
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,130
You don't need to see me.

1258
00:54:24,290 --> 00:54:25,650
Here, I'll even like...

1259
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,950
shrink myself a little bit.

1260
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,290
So that I'm not so annoying in the corner.

1261
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:33,490
Sorry, guys.

1262
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:34,090
Okay.

1263
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:40,460
Oh, here?

1264
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,060
Hello!

1265
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:43,540
Oh, we read all of this?

1266
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:43,780
Hello.

1267
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,020
Now follow my instructions.

1268
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,880
Now follow my instructions.

1269
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,960
I'll pretend to be a customer, so just do what I tell you.

1270
00:54:58,140 --> 00:54:58,500
I'll pretend to be a customer, so just do what I tell you.

1271
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,440
Congrats on becoming the first PowerPoint reader.

1272
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,500
What if I...

1273
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,860
Maybe I should just turn it off.

1274
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,420
Maybe I should just turn off my camera.

1275
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,820
Oh my god, even notifs are lagging.

1276
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,440
This is crazy.

1277
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,540
Oh my gosh, I don't think I saw...

1278
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,940
I don't think I thanked you earlier, Pyrobug.

1279
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:20,860
Oh, thank you for the 20.

1280
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,340
First, make sure you receive the money that the customer places.

1281
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,060
Okay, try it.

1282
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,240
I'm taking your money.

1283
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,240
Next, listen to the customer.

1284
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,220
They will tell you what they will need.

1285
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,840
Put the items inside this basket, okay?

1286
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:44,160
Okay!

1287
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,620
Don't put in items they didn't ask for.

1288
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,240
Alright, let's try it.

1289
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:54,040
Wait, what do you need?

1290
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,980
Oh, listen.

1291
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,840
Body wash, shaver, shampoo, towel.

1292
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,380
Oh my goodness.

1293
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,880
Towel...

1294
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:05,900
Body wash...

1295
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:07,080
Wait.

1296
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,840
Where did it go?

1297
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,340
Oh, sorry.

1298
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,060
Use towel on the floor?

1299
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,440
Body wash...

1300
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,320
Shaver...

1301
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:17,700
What did you say?

1302
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,700
Body wash...

1303
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:21,500
Shaver...

1304
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:21,980
Shampoo...

1305
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,300
Oh, shampoo.

1306
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,140
There you go.

1307
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,780
Easy, right?

1308
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:35,200
Just do what you just did and greet the customers.

1309
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,600
Next, it's a pain in the ass, but...

1310
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,920
I will teach you about the work in the boiler room.

1311
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,920
Oh, okay.

1312
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,060
Why is it suddenly so bright?

1313
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,960
Yeah, the towel looks kind of disgusting.

1314
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:57,660
I'd bring...

1315
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:57,820
Oh.

1316
00:56:59,040 --> 00:56:59,480
Rude?

1317
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,620
You don't hold the door for a lady?

1318
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,440
Huh.

1319
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:03,820
What is...

1320
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,160
What is that...

1321
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,580
What is that symbol?

1322
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,480
He's shivering.

1323
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,280
It's lukewarm.

1324
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:11,960
Menthol check-in, please.

1325
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,060
Thanks, Brian.

1326
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,940
I'm currently frozen, so you can basically take...

1327
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,920
It's basically like so many times a day.

1328
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:22,080
Oh, okay.

1329
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,700
Let's increase the temperature at the boiler room.

1330
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,200
Okay?

1331
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,280
Yeah, lukewarm.

1332
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,380
Ah, lukewarm.

1333
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:29,880
Yeah, yeah.

1334
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:31,700
Here?

1335
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,580
Oh, okay.

1336
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,780
Goodbye.

1337
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,720
Oh, oh.

1338
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:43,110
This is scary.

1339
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,090
This is not where murders occur.

1340
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:47,730
What's over here?

1341
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:49,050
Oh.

1342
00:57:50,190 --> 00:57:50,710
Oh.

1343
00:57:53,490 --> 00:57:54,010
Huh?

1344
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:54,750
Huh?

1345
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:57,590
Oh, I'm in the other area, right?

1346
00:57:59,050 --> 00:57:59,650
Wait, huh?

1347
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,300
I'm exploring, you guys.

1348
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,320
I'm using my detective skills.

1349
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:18,900
Okay, then.

1350
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,640
I'll teach you how to change the bath temperature.

1351
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,860
If you lower the lever, it will decrease the temperature.

1352
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,260
The lower the lever, the higher the temperature.

1353
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,300
Why is mint a PowerPoint?

1354
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,120
See?

1355
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,760
This is why I just want to turn it off.

1356
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,420
I'm not going to lie.

1357
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,920
I don't want people to keep asking me.

1358
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,060
It's because the game is bad.

1359
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:44,720
If you add firewood to the stove, it will increase the temperature.

1360
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,060
Don't put anything but wood in the furnace.

1361
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,400
Or.

1362
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,520
The men's bath temperature is in the orange, so try to keep it there.

1363
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,080
The men's bath temperature is low, so we need to increase it now.

1364
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:12,940
You try.

1365
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,160
Okay, this is the boy's bath.

1366
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:18,200
Oh, my bad.

1367
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:19,900
I want them to freeze.

1368
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,780
I want them to burn.

1369
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,260
Burn!

1370
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:29,260
Burn!

1371
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:30,840
Burn the boys!

1372
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,720
Burn the boys!

1373
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,420
You come out as little lobsters.

1374
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:39,560
Burn!

1375
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,260
Burn!

1376
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:40,840
Burn!

1377
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:42,560
Burn!

1378
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,300
Actually, I wonder if I change the chibiminto if it will be better.

1379
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:48,180
It's okay if I change it.

1380
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:48,460
It's okay if I try.

1381
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:51,400
Let me see.

1382
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,900
I'll be right back.

1383
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,500
I need to change.

1384
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,840
I need to change.

1385
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:04,880
Let's see if I switch the chibiminto if it will be okay.

1386
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:16,370
I guess we'll find out once I go back to the game.

1387
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:19,990
There we go.

1388
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:21,130
Okay.

1389
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:21,730
Okay.

1390
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:23,530
Maybe it'll be easier.

1391
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:28,510
Why are you guys sending blue?

1392
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:32,910
Kind of.

1393
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:40,740
Oh!

1394
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,020
Look at that!

1395
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,940
Resync saved me!

1396
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,080
Yippee!

1397
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,760
Is it good?

1398
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,180
It's still not the right temperature.

1399
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,480
Should I explain again?

1400
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:06,980
No.

1401
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:07,220
Okay.

1402
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,260
So ask me...

1403
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,760
I don't know what to do...

1404
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:35,020
Not sure if it works...

1405
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:37,200
try it...

1406
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:39,420
Josh, thank you!

1407
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:41,200
The camera finds me.

1408
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,300
Thank you!

1409
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:52,600
You can also check the meter in the monitor that's above the counter.

1410
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,100
There's more?

1411
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,520
I'll teach you your next job.

1412
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,240
What?

1413
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,040
There's more?

1414
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,520
Okay...

1415
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,000
Don't leave me in here, please.

1416
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,920
Ochisan, please.

1417
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:06,200
It's too scary in here.

1418
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,000
What's my next job?

1419
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,320
Oh my god.

1420
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:13,760
Loud.

1421
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,800
I'll explain how to clean the place.

1422
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:22,520
I'm gonna start doing karaoke in here.

1423
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:36,700
When the music... when the closing music plays, it's time to clean.

1424
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:53,320
I was told that they're gonna stop using Hotaru no Hikari for the closing song at stores and stuff because too many foreigners are making fun of of...

1425
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,680
of, like, Japanese stores for using it.

1426
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:57,240
They're like, Haha!

1427
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:58,540
Happy New Year!

1428
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,080
Why though?

1429
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,100
For now, I'll show you today's cleaning chore.

1430
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,460
Today we're cleaning the bathtubs.

1431
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:10,180
Today we're cleaning the bathtubs.

1432
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,240
In our men's changing room, bought easily.

1433
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,900
Firstly, there's a cleaning supplies closet in the men's changing room.

1434
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:24,300
Catch the valve key and the brush.

1435
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:31,820
Use the valve key to drain the water and then scrub with the brush.

1436
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:39,140
For now, try cleaning the bathtub I can't tell, but that's in front of me.

1437
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,600
This way?

1438
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,020
Where do I get the valve key?

1439
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,670
Here?

1440
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:52,690
I got my brush.

1441
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,010
I got a weapon.

1442
01:03:55,330 --> 01:03:56,270
Oh, the drain hook.

1443
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:56,650
Okay.

1444
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,230
Where's the key?

1445
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:04,780
I got a mop.

1446
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,790
PowerShot beat the new camera for us.

1447
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:16,090
No!

1448
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:25,860
Thank you so much!

1449
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:34,220
Thank you!

1450
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,600
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1451
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:37,240
Wait, hold on.

1452
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,080
Let me ask where the key was.

1453
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:41,420
Yeah.

1454
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,700
Wait, explain it one more time.

1455
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:51,900
Valve key.

1456
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,160
I don't think I see the valve key.

1457
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,310
The hook is the key?

1458
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:06,770
Oh.

1459
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:12,040
Ah!

1460
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:18,900
Broom.

1461
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:23,750
Oh.

1462
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:27,050
Okay,

1463
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:33,830
you don't need to clean the same bathtub again for today.

1464
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:37,390
Can you speak up, landlord?

1465
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,410
I'll come by to check before you start

1466
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,190
Just do the rest as needed.

1467
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:51,350
I forgot to tell you something important.

1468
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:53,410
This place is haunted!

1469
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:02,050
I'm sure you already know, but there are rules in the bathhouse.

1470
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:13,210
Be sure to send away any customers who don't follow the bathhouse rules.

1471
01:06:17,790 --> 01:06:20,010
Kick them out even when they're taking a bath!

1472
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:20,970
Oh my god.

1473
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:23,870
I don't want to kick out naked people.

1474
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:27,650
That means I have to walk into the men's bathroom.

1475
01:06:30,050 --> 01:06:33,470
There's no point if you do that after they finish taking a bath.

1476
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,840
The rules are pinned on the wall behind the reception desk, so be sure to read it.

1477
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:45,980
I'm lagging again.

1478
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,320
I'm so sorry, you guys.

1479
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:51,440
Since you seem to have some common sense, I'm sure you'll be fine, my nasan.

1480
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,920
Actually, this game is completely breaking my computer.

1481
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,180
Because being here makes me feel sick.

1482
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,040
It's nothing.

1483
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,140
It's because I've got some things to do.

1484
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:10,060
So I'll leave the rest to you.

1485
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,120
Classic Chilla's Art game breaking my computer.

1486
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:15,560
One second.

1487
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,200
I'm gonna turn off this.

1488
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,820
Actually, quit.

1489
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,360
Okay.

1490
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,340
Maybe that'll help.

1491
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,080
Oh!

1492
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,140
Ping pong!

1493
01:07:31,560 --> 01:07:32,200
Hello!

1494
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:34,940
One moment, please.

1495
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,280
I'm... Oh!

1496
01:07:37,540 --> 01:07:38,180
Hello!

1497
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:41,000
It's nothing.

1498
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,100
Oh!

1499
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:43,720
Take your money.

1500
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,260
Wet wipes.

1501
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,240
Oh!

1502
01:07:59,040 --> 01:07:59,840
Oops.

1503
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,300
Sorry.

1504
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,260
Where'd they go?

1505
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,460
My name's Futa.

1506
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,280
Nice to meet you, cutie.

1507
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,050
Do you think this place is weird?

1508
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,510
It makes you feel restless, right?

1509
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,640
Wet wipes, comma.

1510
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:43,000
Where's the money?

1511
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:45,740
Oh, thank you.

1512
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:48,600
Yes, sir.

1513
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:49,980
Towel.

1514
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,140
You guys do not use soap?

1515
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:56,360
Oh, my.

1516
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,740
Did you start this job recently?

1517
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,000
Hey, say something.

1518
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,640
I'm not doing my job.

1519
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:05,680
I'm not greeting the customer.

1520
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:07,460
Ugh, so annoying.

1521
01:09:07,860 --> 01:09:09,380
I knew girls are no good.

1522
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:12,980
Have a man be at the reception desk instead.

1523
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,800
Oh, my God.

1524
01:09:19,220 --> 01:09:20,000
He's gay.

1525
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,220
It's fine.

1526
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:24,120
He's just not into me.

1527
01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:25,880
Are you guys following the rules in here?

1528
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:28,460
There's a monkey in my place.

1529
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:30,980
There's a monkey.

1530
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,820
There's a monkey in the bathhouse.

1531
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:39,560
Never mind.

1532
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:51,660
Okay.

1533
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,520
Freaky things are already happening, you guys.

1534
01:09:58,200 --> 01:09:59,580
Are you following the rules?

1535
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:00,460
I'm coming in.

1536
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:00,860
Oh.

1537
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:05,660
Wow, you are...

1538
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:06,660
I told you he's gay.

1539
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,040
Look how close...

1540
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:09,140
Thank

1541
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:32,950
you, always with the rest of the I'm happy.

1542
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:36,150
Now available for pre-order from yeahlights.com.

1543
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:38,930
Thank you for pre-ordering it.

1544
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:42,790
Hey, this guy touched my butt just now.

1545
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:47,030
People like him lower the quality of the bathhouse.

1546
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:50,010
Oh, no.

1547
01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:54,090
You should be patrolling and kicking out anyone who's being weird.

1548
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:59,070
Kick the rule breakers out of here.

1549
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:01,790
What kind of bathhouse are you running here?

1550
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:10,090
Ask them to leave.

1551
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:13,350
Come on.

1552
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:16,290
Just a little bit is fine.

1553
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,650
He was... he sat like in his lap basically.

1554
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:23,510
Even though he said all that, he wasn't entirely uninterested.

1555
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:28,070
I thought I found myself a good looking man.

1556
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,030
He likes some pain.

1557
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:38,790
He likes some choker.

1558
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:40,890
What's his problem?

1559
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:42,990
I'm going home.

1560
01:11:44,130 --> 01:11:45,950
I mean, he already paid, so...

1561
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:47,530
And also, where else are you gonna go, huh?

1562
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:48,190
Futa?

1563
01:11:49,330 --> 01:11:50,930
Where else are you gonna go?

1564
01:11:50,990 --> 01:11:51,870
You need...

1565
01:11:53,230 --> 01:11:54,030
Oh, my God.

1566
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,210
The stench is following him.

1567
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:58,490
Futa, this is why you need soap!

1568
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:12,330
Dude, it's a slug.

1569
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:13,030
Literally.

1570
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:14,590
Coming!

1571
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,210
Oh, I have a line up.

1572
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:19,450
Sorry.

1573
01:12:22,250 --> 01:12:22,830
Yes?

1574
01:12:23,470 --> 01:12:24,050
Welcome!

1575
01:12:25,290 --> 01:12:26,230
Body wash.

1576
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,430
Oh, see, you get it.

1577
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:30,990
And she knows not to use our shitty towels.

1578
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:34,850
I thought this was the minotaur milking bathhouse.

1579
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:35,330
Oh!

1580
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:39,630
Do I, like, take the money?

1581
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,710
Do I have to click on them to get their money?

1582
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:44,350
Shaver towel.

1583
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:45,470
Okay.

1584
01:12:46,990 --> 01:12:47,430
Shaver.

1585
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,690
Towel.

1586
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:51,370
Maybe they're sharing the body wash.

1587
01:12:54,110 --> 01:12:54,970
Oh, my God.

1588
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:55,490
Grandma.

1589
01:12:56,310 --> 01:12:58,210
My, aren't you a young one?

1590
01:13:00,010 --> 01:13:01,170
Guys, welcome to the membership.

1591
01:13:01,290 --> 01:13:01,650
Thank you!

1592
01:13:01,650 --> 01:13:04,590
Are you the new hire?

1593
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,170
We come here often.

1594
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,550
Pleased to meet you.

1595
01:13:10,310 --> 01:13:12,850
Mio-san, why don't you greet her?

1596
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,790
I don't like her!

1597
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:18,590
I'm sorry.

1598
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,350
She's not a bad person.

1599
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:27,130
By the way, I remember seeing someone who looks just like you.

1600
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,170
Who was it?

1601
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:31,650
Uh...

1602
01:13:31,650 --> 01:13:32,690
Was it a celebrity?

1603
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:33,330
Oh, my God!

1604
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:35,530
We're hot!

1605
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:38,050
No, nothing like that.

1606
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:39,150
Oh, never mind.

1607
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,330
Oh, that's right.

1608
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:43,510
You look just like the last girl who worked here.

1609
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:46,970
Uh...

1610
01:13:46,970 --> 01:13:48,930
Do you know where she is now?

1611
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:51,330
I wonder how she's doing.

1612
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,190
I haven't seen her in so long.

1613
01:13:54,950 --> 01:13:56,530
That was years ago.

1614
01:13:57,110 --> 01:13:59,790
But you really do look like her.

1615
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:02,850
Don't you think so, too, Mio-san?

1616
01:14:03,290 --> 01:14:03,810
Hmm?

1617
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,450
The last employee?

1618
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:07,250
Does she?

1619
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,470
She's that girl who suddenly disappeared, right?

1620
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:13,370
I don't think they look alike.

1621
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:16,830
Anyways, I just can't seem to like this one.

1622
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:18,730
You don't fit here.

1623
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:23,570
My, how could you say that?

1624
01:14:24,910 --> 01:14:27,110
Don't pay attention to what she says.

1625
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:28,990
Do your best.

1626
01:14:29,170 --> 01:14:29,410
Okay?

1627
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:31,130
Aww, thanks, Grandma.

1628
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:31,970
Okay, leave.

1629
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:34,230
Get out.

1630
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:34,650
Go away.

1631
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:36,710
Yeah.

1632
01:14:36,710 --> 01:14:37,650
Get out of here.

1633
01:14:39,150 --> 01:14:41,150
Why does it get so bright all of a sudden?

1634
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:41,750
Light mode?

1635
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,690
Dark mode.

1636
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,510
Light mode?

1637
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:44,430
Dark mode.

1638
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:46,950
Don't be weird in the bath!

1639
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:47,830
I'm watching!

1640
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:51,750
Don't be weird in the bath.

1641
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:52,210
I'm watching.

1642
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,550
I'm watching.

1643
01:14:52,590 --> 01:14:53,350
Don't be weird in the bath.

1644
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,310
I'm sorry if there's a monkey in there, by the way.

1645
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:58,230
I can't find the monkey.

1646
01:15:00,990 --> 01:15:04,150
Apparently there's a monkey around here and I can't find him.

1647
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:05,170
Ah!

1648
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:09,170
The job is not done.

1649
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,020
Wow!

1650
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:17,560
Wait.

1651
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,060
Towel, body wash.

1652
01:15:25,940 --> 01:15:27,300
Body wash.

1653
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,540
Whoops.

1654
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,480
There you go!

1655
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,120
My name is Ray.

1656
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,200
Oh.

1657
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:36,220
Oh.

1658
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,120
My name is Ray, by the way.

1659
01:15:39,540 --> 01:15:40,660
Where do you live?

1660
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:43,080
That's not something you should ask someone.

1661
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,960
That's what I always ask people when I first meet them.

1662
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:48,280
Where do you live?

1663
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:52,880
You don't need to answer that.

1664
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,580
I'm a genius.

1665
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,160
So I can figure out the answer.

1666
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:58,600
Oh no!

1667
01:15:58,740 --> 01:15:59,120
Our bath!

1668
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,160
You can't see?

1669
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:00,820
Oh no, hold on.

1670
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,020
The temperature is going down.

1671
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,120
Ah!

1672
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,160
The temperature is going down!

1673
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:07,200
It's an apartment that's close by, right?

1674
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:08,720
Oh, am I correct?

1675
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,000
Maybe I'll go visit you sometime.

1676
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,140
Ew, Ray!

1677
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:13,040
Go away, please!

1678
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:13,640
Ah!

1679
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,380
I'm sorry!

1680
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:15,180
Oh no!

1681
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:16,580
Stop slugging my...

1682
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:17,980
Stop slugging!

1683
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:18,700
Stop slugging!

1684
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:19,740
I'm going to fix it!

1685
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:20,440
I'm going to fix it!

1686
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:25,340
Over here.

1687
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:26,860
I'm going to fix it!

1688
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:29,100
Wait, it says it's too hot.

1689
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,480
How did it get too hot?

1690
01:16:31,660 --> 01:16:32,820
I didn't put anything in here.

1691
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:34,620
Sorry.

1692
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:37,920
Police?

1693
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:41,240
Police?

1694
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:42,220
I'm so sorry!

1695
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:44,600
Queens!

1696
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,180
I'm sorry!

1697
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:46,560
I did not mean to burn your skin!

1698
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:49,380
One moment, please.

1699
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,080
Let's clean up their disgusting mess.

1700
01:16:54,740 --> 01:16:55,740
What the hell?

1701
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,500
Why do they do this?

1702
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,100
What the hell?

1703
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:02,880
Kami's cosplaying?

1704
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:03,660
No, I didn't!

1705
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,140
Shampoo, towel, wet wipes.

1706
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:09,840
Wipes.

1707
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,060
Shampoo, towel.

1708
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,420
Oh, and your money.

1709
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,480
Oh, what?

1710
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:22,780
Just because you're young, don't get ahead of yourself.

1711
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:23,280
What?

1712
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:24,440
What do you mean by that?

1713
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,220
What did I do?

1714
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,200
I'm just trying to live!

1715
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:29,480
Trying to live!

1716
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:32,200
All that ectoplasm.

1717
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,780
Do you want our addresses so you can haunt us?

1718
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:37,860
I already have them.

1719
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,940
Well, I don't need your address to haunt you, basically.

1720
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:42,540
I think so.

1721
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:47,460
In the countryside, you have to work for the community.

1722
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:50,360
Where did you come from?

1723
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:52,720
Can't answer.

1724
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,000
What a rude kid.

1725
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,100
Actually, I'm gonna put in more stuff into your...

1726
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:57,600
I'm gonna put more fire.

1727
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,000
I'm gonna actually burn you alive.

1728
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:03,200
He said don't put in anything else other than the wood.

1729
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:06,140
But what if it just smelled for like a little bit?

1730
01:18:06,540 --> 01:18:08,640
I came from the city and I've been struggling.

1731
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,840
You should be more considerate.

1732
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:12,060
By the way.

1733
01:18:13,020 --> 01:18:15,040
How can you let that dirty woman in?

1734
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,400
It's disgusting to breathe the same air.

1735
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,620
Let alone the same bath.

1736
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:19,840
Wait, what are you talking about?

1737
01:18:20,980 --> 01:18:21,780
The grandmas?

1738
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,660
What do you mean by that?

1739
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,180
Disgusting woman.

1740
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,160
Who did you see?

1741
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:27,800
I'm scared.

1742
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:33,840
What do you mean by that?

1743
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:39,340
There's an ugly lady in here?

1744
01:18:44,830 --> 01:18:45,930
Now there is.

1745
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,330
Now there's an ugly lady in here.

1746
01:18:48,930 --> 01:18:49,710
Oh my gosh.

1747
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:51,470
I thought that was a baby head for a second.

1748
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:53,970
Are they in the men's bath?

1749
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:57,430
One moment.

1750
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,750
I must check for ugly people.

1751
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:00,350
One second.

1752
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:05,940
Any uglies?

1753
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:08,800
No.

1754
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:09,700
I think we're okay.

1755
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,120
Hello.

1756
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:17,320
Towel.

1757
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,080
Okay.

1758
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:21,840
Do I never give these people their change?

1759
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:23,700
Like, doesn't it say it's only 500 yen?

1760
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:28,380
I take their thousand yen and I just let them go on their merry way.

1761
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:29,120
I take their thousand yen and I just let them go on their merry way.

1762
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,060
I take their thousand yen and I just let them go on their merry way.

1763
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:30,560
Hi there.

1764
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,580
Hey, hold up.

1765
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:37,320
Do hot guys like that come to an old crusty bar?

1766
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:37,880
Bathhouse?

1767
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,680
Like this?

1768
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:40,840
Oh wait, there was a guy in there, wasn't there?

1769
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:42,300
Amazing.

1770
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:44,720
Like, he's like totally my type.

1771
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:46,560
What are you talking about?

1772
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:47,900
Didn't you see?

1773
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,040
Come on, you felt the aura at least.

1774
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:56,840
I don't know how much is a good price for a bathhouse to be honest.

1775
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:57,540
I don't go off.

1776
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,920
But isn't it illegal for him to be in the woman's side?

1777
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,420
So you're telling me that's allowed?

1778
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:05,840
If you're hot?

1779
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:06,860
Oh no.

1780
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,100
Too ugly.

1781
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,540
I don't know.

1782
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,520
Is this okay?

1783
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,860
But that's also kinda hot.

1784
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:20,070
Where?

1785
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:20,830
Where?

1786
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:22,150
Huh?

1787
01:20:22,870 --> 01:20:23,590
In here?

1788
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:25,310
Is there men?

1789
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:30,820
Are these people delusional?

1790
01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:31,780
What are they seeing?

1791
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:32,440
I'm so confused.

1792
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,240
We were just in here.

1793
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,360
No, no, no.

1794
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,340
You must leave.

1795
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:39,960
Ask them to leave.

1796
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,920
They can't have their bathing suit on.

1797
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,160
I wanted to use my favorite floaties.

1798
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:47,760
That's a bummer.

1799
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:52,820
This place is nuts.

1800
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,340
I can't...

1801
01:20:54,340 --> 01:20:57,460
I'm gonna get fired on my first day.

1802
01:21:01,300 --> 01:21:04,540
I'm gonna get fired on my first day because I'm not paying attention.

1803
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,480
Wet wipes, towel, shampoo.

1804
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,200
And take your money.

1805
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:30,100
You're young.

1806
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,820
So you're the new girl in town my boss told me about.

1807
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:37,700
I can see why the owner hired you.

1808
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,500
This is an update to an old game?

1809
01:21:41,660 --> 01:21:42,020
Yep, yep.

1810
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,760
Well, they basically remade the old game.

1811
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:47,120
Because the old game had a game breaking bug in it.

1812
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,540
What do you mean by that, ma'am?

1813
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:49,680
This is an update to an old game?

1814
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,420
What do you mean by that, ma'am?

1815
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:54,180
What do you mean by that?

1816
01:21:54,460 --> 01:21:56,960
What do you mean by that?

1817
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,500
I must follow everybody because you're all such freaks.

1818
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,340
I must follow everybody because you're all such freaks.

1819
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:01,840
No tattoos!

1820
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:03,660
No!

1821
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:05,580
I must ask you to leave.

1822
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:05,940
Huh?

1823
01:22:07,860 --> 01:22:10,340
My boss told me tattoos are allowed here.

1824
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,600
You're getting real cocky now, aren't you?

1825
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:13,840
You better watch out.

1826
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:17,820
Sorry, she's glaring at me.

1827
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,200
It's just the rules.

1828
01:22:24,780 --> 01:22:25,360
I know.

1829
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,200
She was so pretty.

1830
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:29,660
Oh

1831
01:22:33,230 --> 01:22:38,150
Shampoo How old is your kid?

1832
01:22:38,950 --> 01:22:41,210
Is the child under 7 years old?

1833
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:43,370
What are you talking about?

1834
01:22:44,530 --> 01:22:47,070
It says that kids under 7 years old...

1835
01:22:47,070 --> 01:22:47,090
it says that kids under 7 years old...

1836
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:48,590
can go into the woman's bath, doesn't it?

1837
01:22:49,330 --> 01:22:51,050
If you're going to work at a bath house...

1838
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,650
you better remember the bath rules properly!

1839
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,150
That's why I asked!

1840
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,530
How old is he?

1841
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:00,110
He's staring at me.

1842
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:05,840
Don't forget about the temperature.

1843
01:23:06,180 --> 01:23:07,020
I fixed it!

1844
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:07,760
I fixed it!

1845
01:23:11,340 --> 01:23:12,860
How old are you, kid?

1846
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,260
How old are you?

1847
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:22,630
What if he's eight?

1848
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:26,070
How old are you?

1849
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,990
What are you looking at?

1850
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,090
What are you looking at?

1851
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:31,710
What are you looking at?

1852
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:39,530
You need to wash off before you go in there!

1853
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:41,430
Oh my god.

1854
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,490
Back time worker!

1855
01:23:43,770 --> 01:23:44,250
Oh no!

1856
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:45,110
Oh no no no!

1857
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,170
I'm gonna fix it!

1858
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:52,150
Why is it so dark over here?

1859
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:54,890
Oh my gosh, why does the women's bath keep getting so hot?

1860
01:23:58,850 --> 01:24:00,550
I'm not putting anything in here!

1861
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:03,010
Ghost, stop it!

1862
01:24:03,650 --> 01:24:05,090
You're making it difficult!

1863
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:07,730
My afterlife is already difficult enough.

1864
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:10,170
Is it warm to your liking?

1865
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:12,450
Oh, it's nothing.

1866
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,630
Oh, you're fine.

1867
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:14,510
Sorry.

1868
01:24:14,970 --> 01:24:16,910
I'm walking in there with my shoes on.

1869
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:24,520
Any spooky people?

1870
01:24:28,370 --> 01:24:29,410
What the hell is that?

1871
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:31,150
Oh, stop!

1872
01:24:35,330 --> 01:24:36,970
Why am I seeing like...

1873
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:38,250
You see that trail?

1874
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:40,030
That disappears?

1875
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,070
Ghost trail.

1876
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:44,630
Kaya, welcome to membership!

1877
01:24:44,810 --> 01:24:45,270
Thank you!

1878
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:46,630
Oh!

1879
01:24:46,850 --> 01:24:47,770
Oh, it's her.

1880
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,730
It's her nasty and disgustingness.

1881
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:53,030
What about the kid?

1882
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:00,310
Likari Madoki!

1883
01:25:04,820 --> 01:25:05,760
Where's your kid?

1884
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:07,760
Wait...

1885
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,900
No, it's not!

1886
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:13,720
Oh, come on!

1887
01:25:13,720 --> 01:25:14,120
What the hell is this thing?

1888
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:16,880
It's a ghost!

1889
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:18,020
What is this?

1890
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:18,160
Oh, we're talking about the ghost!

1891
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:18,680
What are you talking about?

1892
01:25:18,780 --> 01:25:20,460
Mr. Kanakazu!

1893
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:20,540
What do you mean, Mr. Kanakusu?

1894
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:20,780
No, it's unintelligible.

1895
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:20,920
That doubtful ghost!

1896
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,200
Oh, so you want to be this girl?

1897
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:23,640
Yeah.

1898
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,760
Oh, I know, but she's supposed to be...

1899
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,720
I have to go and get the kid out of my room, so...

1900
01:25:31,540 --> 01:25:33,560
Can you come with me?

1901
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:34,140
Yeah.

1902
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:34,760
Okay.

1903
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:36,380
All right.

1904
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:37,040
You hold up that rope, then.

1905
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:37,740
Okay.

1906
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:40,580
Noooo!

1907
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:46,160
Aww man.

1908
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:58,440
I'm just literally in the middle of saying, is this where the scary stuff happens now?

1909
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:01,640
The real horror of this game is the rude customers.

1910
01:26:02,180 --> 01:26:04,320
Oh god, be careful.

1911
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:06,180
There's a spirit in this bathhouse.

1912
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:08,880
That spirit meant phantom.

1913
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:11,360
Oh hey, your mom left already!

1914
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,480
My mom?

1915
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,240
I don't have a mom.

1916
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,200
Oh, where are you going?

1917
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,080
Hey kid!

1918
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:22,340
You need to change!

1919
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:23,180
Kid!

1920
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:24,880
You can't go out!

1921
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,240
Gosh,

1922
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:43,350
this is so much for one person.

1923
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:48,710
This is too much for one person.

1924
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:50,450
I guess there's nothing here.

1925
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:57,210
I don't like that I'm like, looking down, you know?

1926
01:26:58,210 --> 01:27:00,450
So directly at the...

1927
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:05,350
It makes me feel like anything can pop out, you know?

1928
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,060
Aww man!

1929
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,880
This is hard work!

1930
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,180
This is the...

1931
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:22,000
This is the hard, hard work!

1932
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:24,380
Okay!

1933
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:28,440
Ghost, I just got here, okay?

1934
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:30,120
You be nice to me, please.

1935
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:32,700
Wait, why am I draining it?

1936
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:34,040
To clean it?

1937
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,800
To then fill it back up?

1938
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:36,640
To take a bath?

1939
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:39,300
This is...

1940
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,480
Is someone there?

1941
01:27:51,340 --> 01:27:52,260
I'm sorry!

1942
01:27:53,380 --> 01:27:55,920
The bath house is closed for today!

1943
01:27:56,920 --> 01:27:58,440
No, that's not true.

1944
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,700
I'm an employee here.

1945
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,520
I'm an employee here.

1946
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,340
Um, we don't have enough buckets here.

1947
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:12,280
Uh, there isn't enough buckets, so...

1948
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:14,120
Can you throw one to me?

1949
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,420
Can you throw one to me?

1950
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:16,880
Can you throw one to me?

1951
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:18,640
What?

1952
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:23,040
Uh...

1953
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:31,600
Huh...

1954
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:33,860
Huh?

1955
01:28:38,630 --> 01:28:40,170
Where do I get the bucket from?

1956
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:43,670
This is...

1957
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:46,570
I'm scared.

1958
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:49,090
I'm scared!

1959
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:54,430
But she sounds cute, so...

1960
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:55,850
Oh wait, one of these...

1961
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:56,310
Please don't come here.

1962
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:58,970
Please don't come here.

1963
01:28:59,170 --> 01:28:59,950
One of these?

1964
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:01,690
Oh, sorry.

1965
01:29:03,010 --> 01:29:03,850
Uh...

1966
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:04,650
Colby?

1967
01:29:05,210 --> 01:29:06,070
Thank you.

1968
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:07,670
You're welcome.

1969
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,610
Oh, I forgot to get this one.

1970
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:44,730
Oh, I forgot to get this one.

1971
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:47,840
Oh, hi.

1972
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,360
There they are again.

1973
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:53,040
I love...

1974
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:53,160
I love...

1975
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:53,740
I love you.

1976
01:29:57,820 --> 01:29:58,900
Today's cleaning.

1977
01:29:58,900 --> 01:29:59,340
Everything is done!

1978
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,740
I'll take a shower.

1979
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:02,500
Where?

1980
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:05,620
What?

1981
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:06,440
Oh, here.

1982
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:11,680
Oh my god!

1983
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:12,860
Face down?

1984
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:15,820
Why do I look so scared?

1985
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,380
Why do I look so scared?

1986
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:21,840
The egg.

1987
01:30:22,060 --> 01:30:22,800
Oh, I'm washing?

1988
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:24,940
I'm washing, I'm washing.

1989
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:25,480
Oh god.

1990
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,960
Naked boy!

1991
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,010
What do I do?

1992
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:36,930
It won't let me keep washing!

1993
01:30:37,670 --> 01:30:38,870
Oh, face down.

1994
01:30:43,180 --> 01:30:45,260
There's somebody naked in here!

1995
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:46,620
And a monkey!

1996
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,360
This place is so cursed.

1997
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,060
Oh my god, why are the lights out?

1998
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,060
What happened?

1999
01:30:58,130 --> 01:30:59,910
Why did the lights go out?

2000
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:06,700
This place is crazy!

2001
01:31:07,220 --> 01:31:07,640
Just run.

2002
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:12,340
It's a damn monkey.

2003
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,140
Why are all the lights out?

2004
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:18,940
Monkey!

2005
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:21,120
I'm going home.

2006
01:31:21,380 --> 01:31:22,460
The job is done.

2007
01:31:22,600 --> 01:31:22,740
No!

2008
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:23,980
The job is done!

2009
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:24,640
Please!

2010
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,000
The job is done!

2011
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,880
What do you mean I did my job?

2012
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:33,180
I don't get paid enough for monkey.

2013
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:34,920
In here?

2014
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,100
Oh my god.

2015
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:38,740
Oh!

2016
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:38,880
Oh!

2017
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,260
Oh!

2018
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:43,600
Oh!

2019
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,100
What the hell?

2020
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:53,440
Oh my god!

2021
01:31:53,620 --> 01:31:54,600
They killed the boy!

2022
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,200
What?

2023
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:01,720
What is...

2024
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:03,380
Oh my god!

2025
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:22,520
There's literally Planet of the Apes up in here.

2026
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:25,020
Oh, time for work already.

2027
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,240
Oh, I don't want to go!

2028
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:29,280
I don't want to go to work!

2029
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,800
Five more minutes.

2030
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,960
Five more minutes.

2031
01:32:39,700 --> 01:32:41,040
Just five more minutes.

2032
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:44,320
Okay.

2033
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:46,460
Time for work.

2034
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:48,480
What was that all about yesterday?

2035
01:32:48,900 --> 01:32:49,420
Yeah.

2036
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,720
That's an understatement, I think.

2037
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,760
Yeah, what was that about?

2038
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:57,940
What?

2039
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:01,660
We love Uniqlo, it seems.

2040
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,160
Good thing we don't dry our stuff outside.

2041
01:33:14,690 --> 01:33:15,370
Oh wow!

2042
01:33:15,550 --> 01:33:16,770
We got all of our stuff and everything.

2043
01:33:19,310 --> 01:33:20,730
Yesterday was monkey day.

2044
01:33:20,950 --> 01:33:22,170
Quit monkeying around.

2045
01:33:26,070 --> 01:33:26,950
I'm admiring!

2046
01:33:27,190 --> 01:33:28,270
I'm not being Ojiisan!

2047
01:33:29,230 --> 01:33:33,030
I'm thinking of how cute they are and how I don't want them to get stolen by a monkey!

2048
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:34,410
Duh!

2049
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:38,210
Um...

2050
01:33:38,210 --> 01:33:39,930
Let's get our best Zero.

2051
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:44,390
Oh my god.

2052
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,250
Rain again.

2053
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:45,650
Oh!

2054
01:33:45,710 --> 01:33:45,790
Rain again.

2055
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,550
Hello.

2056
01:33:47,090 --> 01:33:47,570
Neighbor.

2057
01:33:51,370 --> 01:33:52,770
Is everything okay?

2058
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,690
Have you tried the doorbell?

2059
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:00,590
This town is bizarre.

2060
01:34:02,410 --> 01:34:04,050
Can you imagine if like...

2061
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:08,330
Kind of like how Fierce to Fathom, they're just like, this is based on a true story.

2062
01:34:08,530 --> 01:34:10,310
Can you imagine if these were too?

2063
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,530
It's like I was working at the bathhouse.

2064
01:34:13,870 --> 01:34:14,610
And then...

2065
01:34:14,610 --> 01:34:14,930
Oh no!

2066
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:15,770
Oh no!

2067
01:34:16,230 --> 01:34:16,630
Oh!

2068
01:34:16,630 --> 01:34:16,670
Oh!

2069
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:17,430
It got destroyed!

2070
01:34:20,090 --> 01:34:24,210
I was working at this bathhouse and on my first day a bunch of monkeys killed a boy!

2071
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:27,110
Oh.

2072
01:34:28,670 --> 01:34:29,070
Hello.

2073
01:34:31,650 --> 01:34:33,330
I'm sorry I had a rough day yesterday.

2074
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:33,730
Yeah.

2075
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:34,370
Yeah.

2076
01:34:34,410 --> 01:34:34,690
I did.

2077
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:37,210
Oh.

2078
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:37,570
Ray.

2079
01:34:37,730 --> 01:34:37,930
Yeah.

2080
01:34:38,010 --> 01:34:38,570
That guy.

2081
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:38,970
The...

2082
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:39,630
The pale guy.

2083
01:34:39,770 --> 01:34:39,970
Right?

2084
01:34:40,810 --> 01:34:43,050
I like how in Japanese he says his name.

2085
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:43,570
But...

2086
01:34:45,110 --> 01:34:45,510
Here.

2087
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:45,610
Here.

2088
01:34:45,610 --> 01:34:46,890
They just call him like...

2089
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:48,870
They're just like...

2090
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:48,970
Yeah.

2091
01:34:49,130 --> 01:34:49,770
That guy.

2092
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:50,950
That guy who needs sun.

2093
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:54,990
He probably had too much to drink.

2094
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,730
It's common amongst young folks who visit here.

2095
01:35:04,830 --> 01:35:06,670
I wish it would stop till...

2096
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:09,790
There were a lot of monkeys.

2097
01:35:14,310 --> 01:35:14,850
Monkeys?

2098
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:18,090
This is a rural area.

2099
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:18,430
Yeah.

2100
01:35:18,510 --> 01:35:18,950
Oh gosh.

2101
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:19,650
The inaka.

2102
01:35:21,870 --> 01:35:22,930
Monkeys are everywhere!

2103
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:24,670
What about the dead guy?

2104
01:35:28,810 --> 01:35:30,490
They're pretty common around here.

2105
01:35:30,550 --> 01:35:31,610
So don't worry about it.

2106
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:34,330
Oh.

2107
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:36,710
Today we're going to clean the walls.

2108
01:35:38,010 --> 01:35:38,570
Yeah.

2109
01:35:38,570 --> 01:35:39,510
What about the dead kid?

2110
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:42,110
And the hair!

2111
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,150
The monkey cult.

2112
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:45,150
Planet.

2113
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:45,490
The planet!

2114
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,550
Planet of the apes uprising!

2115
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:48,830
What about any of that?

2116
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:53,910
Spray the walls with detergent and then scrub them with a scrub brush.

2117
01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:01,130
Sorry.

2118
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,630
Spray cleaner and a scrubber...

2119
01:36:03,630 --> 01:36:03,790
Oh.

2120
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:05,810
Spray cleaner and a scrubber are in the toolbox.

2121
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:09,810
I don't think I will.

2122
01:36:10,550 --> 01:36:12,590
And when you're done today you can take a bath.

2123
01:36:12,590 --> 01:36:12,810
Ah.

2124
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:13,550
I see.

2125
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:14,070
I see.

2126
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:16,370
Oh yes.

2127
01:36:16,450 --> 01:36:16,990
I almost forgot.

2128
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,590
Today is the day of Keiichi, the regular visitor.

2129
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:20,950
Yeah.

2130
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:22,630
I'm still getting over my jet lag.

2131
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:26,670
Today is the day our regular visitor Keiichi comes over.

2132
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:27,510
Long time no see.

2133
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:29,310
Oh.

2134
01:36:29,550 --> 01:36:31,650
He's my good friend.

2135
01:36:31,790 --> 01:36:33,350
It's been a while since he visited.

2136
01:36:33,670 --> 01:36:35,690
I've been looking forward to this day.

2137
01:36:35,950 --> 01:36:41,770
I've been looking forward to this day for your friend to come visit you at the bathhouse?

2138
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:45,190
Okay.

2139
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:55,350
He's a stern looking man and wears a suit all the time.

2140
01:36:57,090 --> 01:36:58,570
Make sure you send him through.

2141
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,470
Okay.

2142
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:03,690
Why are you leaving then if your friend is coming?

2143
01:37:05,890 --> 01:37:06,330
Wait.

2144
01:37:06,390 --> 01:37:07,430
So I scrub the walls?

2145
01:37:08,450 --> 01:37:09,210
What is this?

2146
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:09,930
Oh.

2147
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:11,910
This is the walls I scrub I guess.

2148
01:37:12,130 --> 01:37:12,570
I see.

2149
01:37:13,970 --> 01:37:15,090
Towel, shaver, shampoo.

2150
01:37:17,730 --> 01:37:18,210
Towel.

2151
01:37:20,430 --> 01:37:20,910
Shaver.

2152
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:24,310
And a shampoo.

2153
01:37:25,750 --> 01:37:26,230
Hey.

2154
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:27,890
Come on.

2155
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,970
Imagine if it was based on a true story like Parasocial.

2156
01:37:31,490 --> 01:37:31,970
Wait.

2157
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:33,770
Parasocial is based on a true story?

2158
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:35,910
I haven't played that one actually.

2159
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:38,090
You're really slow at your job.

2160
01:37:38,970 --> 01:37:42,070
I guess being young doesn't mean you can do the job right.

2161
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:42,550
What?

2162
01:37:42,570 --> 01:37:43,910
You have to pick up the pace.

2163
01:37:44,570 --> 01:37:45,450
I'm streaming.

2164
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:47,030
I have to entertain my child.

2165
01:37:48,570 --> 01:37:50,510
Don't you think I can do your job better than you?

2166
01:37:50,670 --> 01:37:51,070
Okay.

2167
01:37:51,090 --> 01:37:51,990
Then you work here.

2168
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:54,270
Don't take the job lightly.

2169
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,710
Everyone here is so rude.

2170
01:37:57,950 --> 01:38:00,070
I'm going to kick this lady out for no reason.

2171
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,030
You can leave.

2172
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:04,510
You can leave.

2173
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,210
So what do I do?

2174
01:38:07,270 --> 01:38:08,890
I get the...

2175
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:14,820
He says I have to scrub the walls.

2176
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:14,980
Okay.

2177
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,200
He says I get the stuff and I...

2178
01:38:16,200 --> 01:38:18,060
Let's check on the temperature real quick.

2179
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:20,420
Her name is Kaiden.

2180
01:38:22,100 --> 01:38:22,580
Yeah.

2181
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:23,220
Clearly.

2182
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:25,920
Let's lower that a little bit.

2183
01:38:26,020 --> 01:38:26,160
Okay.

2184
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:27,560
This women's bathroom is good.

2185
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:36,430
I get the stuff from here and I scrub the walls?

2186
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:37,410
Oh yeah.

2187
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,330
I guess after everybody is gone.

2188
01:38:41,550 --> 01:38:41,870
Okay.

2189
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:44,570
But what is...

2190
01:38:44,570 --> 01:38:45,050
What is...

2191
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:46,530
Why is there that here?

2192
01:38:46,690 --> 01:38:47,370
Oh God.

2193
01:38:53,770 --> 01:38:54,490
Oh my.

2194
01:38:54,490 --> 01:38:55,510
A wet wipes shampoo towel.

2195
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:02,330
Wet wipes shampoo towel.

2196
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:03,970
There you go.

2197
01:39:04,170 --> 01:39:04,850
Oh Jo-chan...

2198
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:08,330
Oh Jo-chan?

2199
01:39:09,070 --> 01:39:09,790
Oh Jo-chan?

2200
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:12,310
Young lady, you have a nice body.

2201
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,270
But Edward, is that Edward Cullen?

2202
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:17,690
If you lose a bit more, but...

2203
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:18,330
More weight!

2204
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:20,810
You'd be more popular!

2205
01:39:38,660 --> 01:39:40,540
Can you cook?

2206
01:39:42,460 --> 01:39:43,220
No.

2207
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:47,480
You can't cook even though you're a woman?

2208
01:39:49,940 --> 01:39:53,440
Women need to be perfect in housekeeping and childcare.

2209
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:58,580
You're still young, so it's a close call, but...

2210
01:39:59,090 --> 01:39:59,780
You pass.

2211
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:06,900
I'll let you be my woman.

2212
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:23,500
Minto, my woman.

2213
01:40:24,240 --> 01:40:25,200
I'll pass.

2214
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,740
You're a shy one.

2215
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,720
Monkey's spooking.

2216
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,100
I don't hate that.

2217
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:33,260
Well, for today, I'll just get in the bath.

2218
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,760
Jukebox, don't do that.

2219
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:40,320
It scares me.

2220
01:40:41,740 --> 01:40:42,820
I must clean up.

2221
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:47,080
I must clean up her disgusting nastiness.

2222
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,400
Everyone asks for a towel, but no one uses it.

2223
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,760
Let me make sure he's not being a freak in there.

2224
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:54,920
He probably... Oh!

2225
01:40:54,980 --> 01:40:55,560
Oh my god.

2226
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,760
Oh god, talk about a pale, skinny guy.

2227
01:40:59,500 --> 01:40:59,900
So...

2228
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,060
Slender man over here.

2229
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:05,500
Geez, I need a damn jump scare.

2230
01:41:06,620 --> 01:41:09,560
Can you cause him to drop his ass?

2231
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:10,720
So true.

2232
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:13,960
At least he's...

2233
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,860
Yeah, you say I need to eat less.

2234
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:19,920
You need to eat...

2235
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,380
Why are you going into the boiler room?

2236
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,100
What are you doing?

2237
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:25,260
What are you doing?

2238
01:41:25,940 --> 01:41:26,700
What are you...

2239
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:27,080
Oh god!

2240
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,060
What is wrong with him?

2241
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:30,740
Get out of me!

2242
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:31,680
Leave, please!

2243
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:33,760
I'm trying to ask him to leave, but he's...

2244
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,940
Sorry, he's really scaring me.

2245
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:36,540
Stop!

2246
01:41:37,120 --> 01:41:37,520
Leave!

2247
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:45,850
He's not leaving!

2248
01:41:50,220 --> 01:41:51,160
You need to leave.

2249
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,480
You guys, he's scaring me.

2250
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,500
He's scaring me so much.

2251
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:58,540
Can I ask him to leave?

2252
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:01,100
Okay, I'm leaving.

2253
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:01,540
I'm leaving.

2254
01:42:01,540 --> 01:42:01,900
I'm leaving.

2255
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:02,240
I'm leaving.

2256
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:03,400
I'm leaving.

2257
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:03,420
I'm leaving.

2258
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:04,880
I'm sorry.

2259
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:05,860
Listen.

2260
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,360
Shave or shampoo?

2261
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:08,640
Wet wipes or body wash?

2262
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,780
Shave or shampoo?

2263
01:42:13,120 --> 01:42:14,040
Wet wipes?

2264
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,680
Body wash?

2265
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:21,100
Was it busy today?

2266
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:22,880
Not that many.

2267
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:23,460
Really?

2268
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:27,420
Well, it's not like there wasn't any customers at all.

2269
01:42:27,780 --> 01:42:30,200
I hope a lot of customers come.

2270
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:32,240
There he goes.

2271
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:35,860
What's happening?

2272
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,780
He's scaring me.

2273
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:42,240
I'm glad he's gone.

2274
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,120
Oh my god.

2275
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,700
He scared me so much.

2276
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,440
He left his stuff.

2277
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,420
Sir!

2278
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:52,540
Sir!

2279
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,940
Why does he need the shampoo?

2280
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,120
That's a good question, actually.

2281
01:42:58,680 --> 01:42:59,200
What the?

2282
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:00,220
Um.

2283
01:43:09,610 --> 01:43:10,410
Let me try this.

2284
01:43:10,410 --> 01:43:14,610
Let me just take one last photo- That's two!

2285
01:43:16,070 --> 01:43:16,930
Get out of here.

2286
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:18,810
What?

2287
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:22,630
Stay away from me!

2288
01:43:22,750 --> 01:43:23,330
I'm leaving!

2289
01:43:23,470 --> 01:43:23,710
I'm leaving!

2290
01:43:25,850 --> 01:43:26,650
Wait, what happened?

2291
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:28,270
What's behind me?

2292
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:29,190
What's behind me?

2293
01:43:30,350 --> 01:43:31,150
What's there?

2294
01:43:31,270 --> 01:43:31,630
What's there?

2295
01:43:31,630 --> 01:43:31,970
What's there?

2296
01:43:32,510 --> 01:43:34,050
I saw a ghost in the photo.

2297
01:43:36,310 --> 01:43:36,750
Hello.

2298
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,210
Towel, body wash, shampoo.

2299
01:43:40,650 --> 01:43:44,650
Towel, body wash, shampoo.

2300
01:43:47,470 --> 01:43:49,730
Why is a little girl like you working here?

2301
01:43:50,490 --> 01:43:51,350
I'm 19!

2302
01:43:51,770 --> 01:43:52,230
Forever!

2303
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:57,650
That guy didn't even hire me when I told him I wanted to work here.

2304
01:43:58,470 --> 01:44:03,270
Whatever, a girl like you won't be able to manage the workload in this- You know what, please.

2305
01:44:04,610 --> 01:44:05,430
Denko-sama.

2306
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:08,190
Denko-sama, please switch with me.

2307
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:12,310
I will take all the credit, but you can work here.

2308
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:12,730
It's fine.

2309
01:44:14,730 --> 01:44:16,590
I'll give you three days until you quit.

2310
01:44:17,530 --> 01:44:23,710
Well, do you follow the rules of the bathhouse, or are you a freak?

2311
01:44:26,350 --> 01:44:28,390
Well, do you follow the rules?

2312
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,440
I wish the ghost would haunt these people.

2313
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:36,100
Seriously!

2314
01:44:37,620 --> 01:44:40,280
This ghost has nothing to do with me.

2315
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:45,640
Everything seems normal.

2316
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:49,220
I'll go check the temperature in a second.

2317
01:44:52,100 --> 01:44:52,980
What the hell?

2318
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,080
Oh my god!

2319
01:44:54,640 --> 01:44:56,540
You are doing everything wrong!

2320
01:44:58,480 --> 01:45:00,180
You need to leave!

2321
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:05,720
Why do I have to get kicked out by a little girl like you?

2322
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,760
What are you saying that I've done?

2323
01:45:07,980 --> 01:45:09,460
This job is too much for you.

2324
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:12,460
Now I have to clean this up!

2325
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:14,700
Oh my god...

2326
01:45:16,660 --> 01:45:17,060
Lady!

2327
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:19,880
Wait, is it this?

2328
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:22,100
Or is it the scrubber?

2329
01:45:22,240 --> 01:45:27,480
Oh, wait, no, it's this- Oh god, that scared me.

2330
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,400
I heard- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming.

2331
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:30,440
Robin.

2332
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:34,480
Hello?

2333
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,680
Body wash, towel.

2334
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:38,560
Towel...

2335
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:40,660
Body wash.

2336
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:43,000
Hello?

2337
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:44,060
Oh, never mind.

2338
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:46,220
Um...

2339
01:45:46,220 --> 01:45:47,980
No, never mind.

2340
01:45:49,540 --> 01:45:50,100
What?

2341
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:50,460
What's wrong?

2342
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:59,180
I feel like this place is too small for, like, foreigners.

2343
01:45:59,180 --> 01:46:00,340
Maybe a jet program.

2344
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,080
Yes?

2345
01:46:08,290 --> 01:46:09,130
No.

2346
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:10,470
Um... towel.

2347
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:11,690
I want a towel.

2348
01:46:11,930 --> 01:46:13,610
The small Japanese towel.

2349
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:15,490
Understood, I'll bring it.

2350
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:16,850
Okay.

2351
01:46:17,990 --> 01:46:18,630
Um...

2352
01:46:19,610 --> 01:46:20,270
Um...

2353
01:46:21,390 --> 01:46:21,810
Um...

2354
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:22,790
Yes?

2355
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:24,450
Um...

2356
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:25,950
Um...

2357
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:26,770
Thank you.

2358
01:46:27,070 --> 01:46:27,750
You're welcome.

2359
01:46:29,190 --> 01:46:30,030
Hello?

2360
01:46:30,950 --> 01:46:32,490
He's very polite.

2361
01:46:34,470 --> 01:46:35,610
Ah, ah, no.

2362
01:46:36,750 --> 01:46:37,850
Ah, ah, no.

2363
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:39,870
Ah, ah, no.

2364
01:46:40,450 --> 01:46:40,890
Oh!

2365
01:46:42,490 --> 01:46:45,980
What is that?

2366
01:46:46,200 --> 01:46:49,360
What are you- Why are you in this small town?

2367
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:52,780
This is like that one- What's that anime?

2368
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:59,860
Or not anime, that, like, movie about the Yankee girl and the Lolita girl that live in, like- Oh!

2369
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:01,020
Sorry, hold on.

2370
01:47:01,340 --> 01:47:02,340
I gotta make sure this is the right place.

2371
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,320
This guy's not being weird in here.

2372
01:47:03,480 --> 01:47:04,020
Real quick.

2373
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:06,880
Okay.

2374
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:07,600
He's being normal.

2375
01:47:07,780 --> 01:47:08,260
Everything's fine.

2376
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:10,020
Um...

2377
01:47:15,080 --> 01:47:15,980
Towel, shaver.

2378
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,060
Shaver.

2379
01:47:18,220 --> 01:47:18,700
Towel.

2380
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:20,500
Money.

2381
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:24,040
No!

2382
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:24,860
Amateur!

2383
01:47:25,660 --> 01:47:27,320
The pure, the true, the beautiful!

2384
01:47:27,500 --> 01:47:28,300
I'm Amateur!

2385
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,980
It's been so long since I last went to a bathhouse.

2386
01:47:32,080 --> 01:47:32,320
Amateur!

2387
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,780
It gets me excited.

2388
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:35,280
Wow.

2389
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:36,860
Amateur!

2390
01:47:39,140 --> 01:47:41,740
I like how that one guy's stuff is still here.

2391
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,400
He just zombied out.

2392
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:47,240
She's an eye- Oh!

2393
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:48,020
The temperature!

2394
01:47:48,220 --> 01:47:48,580
Oh no!

2395
01:47:48,780 --> 01:47:49,360
I'm sorry!

2396
01:47:51,120 --> 01:47:51,940
I'm sorry!

2397
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:52,200
No!

2398
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,160
I did bad!

2399
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:53,780
I did bad!

2400
01:47:55,540 --> 01:47:56,320
I'm sorry!

2401
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:00,570
It's too hot.

2402
01:48:03,190 --> 01:48:05,130
And then we need to put more in here, actually.

2403
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:06,310
So, this is good.

2404
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:09,550
We'll do this before she gets angry.

2405
01:48:14,190 --> 01:48:14,630
And...

2406
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:16,170
That should be good.

2407
01:48:16,290 --> 01:48:16,630
Okay.

2408
01:48:16,690 --> 01:48:17,110
I'm scared.

2409
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:17,710
Ehhh!

2410
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:18,590
Get me out of here!

2411
01:48:18,690 --> 01:48:19,010
Ehhh!

2412
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:21,310
Run, run, run.

2413
01:48:22,710 --> 01:48:24,750
And we gotta clean up this guy's mess.

2414
01:48:25,010 --> 01:48:26,030
I'm sorry, sir!

2415
01:48:26,450 --> 01:48:28,610
I'm sorry that it was unsatisfactory!

2416
01:48:29,210 --> 01:48:30,310
I'm so sorry!

2417
01:48:33,570 --> 01:48:35,130
That's Hora e Emma, and that's Hora Emma.

2418
01:48:35,130 --> 01:48:36,030
She's an actual Japanese VTuber.

2419
01:48:36,110 --> 01:48:37,390
She's a guest appearance for this game.

2420
01:48:37,610 --> 01:48:38,010
What?

2421
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:38,670
That's so cool!

2422
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:39,950
Emma-chi!

2423
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:42,330
Oh my god!

2424
01:48:45,330 --> 01:48:48,210
How do they make the characters in this game even more horrifying?

2425
01:48:48,610 --> 01:48:49,330
Is she being normal?

2426
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:51,070
Yeah.

2427
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:51,870
Sorry, Emma-chi.

2428
01:48:51,930 --> 01:48:53,210
I don't mean to come see you in the bath.

2429
01:48:53,290 --> 01:48:56,190
I'm just, you know, checking if everything's okay.

2430
01:48:57,690 --> 01:48:58,090
Ah!

2431
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:00,170
Hello?

2432
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:01,930
Oh!

2433
01:49:02,630 --> 01:49:03,030
Oh!

2434
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:04,290
Oh!

2435
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:04,530
Oh!

2436
01:49:04,650 --> 01:49:05,050
Oh!

2437
01:49:05,050 --> 01:49:05,110
Oh!

2438
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:05,170
Oh!

2439
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:05,870
Oh!

2440
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:06,210
Yeah!

2441
01:49:06,330 --> 01:49:06,630
Yeah!

2442
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:08,750
Wet wipes!

2443
01:49:10,450 --> 01:49:11,250
Wet wipes!

2444
01:49:14,630 --> 01:49:15,030
Chi!

2445
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:15,850
Chi!

2446
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:17,270
Work faster!

2447
01:49:22,090 --> 01:49:23,450
I think we got a spooky...

2448
01:49:23,450 --> 01:49:23,590
Ah!

2449
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:24,430
Oh my god.

2450
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:25,910
Bye!

2451
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:27,770
I hope you had a good time here!

2452
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:30,070
I think this lady's about to be a freak.

2453
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:30,670
Oh, let me...

2454
01:49:30,670 --> 01:49:31,290
Let me clean.

2455
01:49:33,150 --> 01:49:34,050
Let me clean.

2456
01:49:34,810 --> 01:49:36,170
She's about to be a freak in here.

2457
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:36,650
I know.

2458
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:38,150
It's nothing.

2459
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:39,370
Once...

2460
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:39,970
You're fine.

2461
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:41,670
You're fine.

2462
01:49:42,430 --> 01:49:43,590
Where's that guy's friend?

2463
01:49:48,270 --> 01:49:48,830
Okay.

2464
01:49:49,690 --> 01:49:51,150
So far, normal.

2465
01:49:52,890 --> 01:49:53,670
Kind of.

2466
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:03,000
Is everything okay?

2467
01:50:03,620 --> 01:50:04,840
Oh, I forgot a spot.

2468
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,320
I missed a spot.

2469
01:50:09,240 --> 01:50:10,020
I'm coming!

2470
01:50:13,010 --> 01:50:13,650
Hello!

2471
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:14,430
Oh!

2472
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:16,230
Hello, short king.

2473
01:50:17,970 --> 01:50:19,630
Towel, shampoo, shaver.

2474
01:50:20,930 --> 01:50:21,570
Towel.

2475
01:50:23,090 --> 01:50:23,730
Shampoo.

2476
01:50:25,770 --> 01:50:26,410
Shaver.

2477
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:28,610
Where's your money?

2478
01:50:28,970 --> 01:50:31,670
I was excited for the bathhouse.

2479
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:38,410
I don't think you're a kid.

2480
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:40,430
What?

2481
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:41,690
I don't think you're a kid.

2482
01:50:41,690 --> 01:50:43,030
Are you a child?

2483
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:47,650
Are you a...?

2484
01:50:49,830 --> 01:50:51,570
Look at the way he's glaring at me.

2485
01:50:52,990 --> 01:50:54,470
He's gray hairs.

2486
01:50:56,130 --> 01:50:56,950
Hey, hey, hey.

2487
01:51:01,610 --> 01:51:03,050
Wasn't that him on the poster?

2488
01:51:03,330 --> 01:51:03,870
Oh my god.

2489
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:05,470
What!?

2490
01:51:05,470 --> 01:51:06,210
Ah!

2491
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:10,410
Excuse me!

2492
01:51:12,810 --> 01:51:14,030
Why can't I?

2493
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:15,730
I'm sure so?

2494
01:51:15,770 --> 01:51:16,130
I'm the same?

2495
01:51:16,130 --> 01:51:16,730
I'm the same as a kid!

2496
01:51:17,730 --> 01:51:19,710
I'm a kid, so anything I do is okay!

2497
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:20,790
Huh?

2498
01:51:20,970 --> 01:51:21,610
It's a crime?

2499
01:51:22,310 --> 01:51:22,750
Sorry.

2500
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:25,850
He's moonwalking out of here.

2501
01:51:43,980 --> 01:51:45,080
Is this lady?

2502
01:51:45,220 --> 01:51:46,500
Oh, this lady is leaving now.

2503
01:51:48,860 --> 01:51:49,900
One second...

2504
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:51,860
That's the guy!

2505
01:51:52,480 --> 01:51:53,260
Call Coke!

2506
01:51:53,700 --> 01:51:54,700
Everybody call Coke!

2507
01:51:57,430 --> 01:51:58,250
Oh my god!

2508
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:00,930
Oh!

2509
01:52:00,930 --> 01:52:01,990
He doesn't want anything!

2510
01:52:02,310 --> 01:52:03,330
He didn't even talk!

2511
01:52:08,010 --> 01:52:09,450
Are you sure you don't...

2512
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:14,850
Uh oh, I think something really spooky is gonna happen because the ghost is gonna be like...

2513
01:52:14,850 --> 01:52:15,530
It's him!

2514
01:52:16,050 --> 01:52:16,830
My killer!

2515
01:52:19,210 --> 01:52:19,830
Yeah?

2516
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:27,640
Why is he moving in slow motion?

2517
01:52:28,720 --> 01:52:29,340
Hello?

2518
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:31,400
What's going on?

2519
01:52:32,120 --> 01:52:32,740
What?

2520
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:37,260
He's heading off into anime battle!

2521
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:41,100
You're short?

2522
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:42,320
It's the same as a kid!

2523
01:52:43,730 --> 01:52:44,040
Yes?

2524
01:52:44,540 --> 01:52:45,440
Can I help you?

2525
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,720
He's acting cool.

2526
01:52:50,060 --> 01:52:50,540
Yeah?

2527
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,300
Why are you coming towards me?

2528
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:56,480
Shut the door!

2529
01:53:04,890 --> 01:53:05,770
Oh, he's leaving.

2530
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,520
Body wash, towel, wet wipes, shaver...

2531
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:28,760
He didn't even bathe!

2532
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:29,880
He just walked in and looked around!

2533
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:31,880
Body wash...

2534
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:40,920
Towel, wet wipes, shaver...

2535
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:43,480
Money.

2536
01:53:44,740 --> 01:53:45,620
Hey, you!

2537
01:53:46,860 --> 01:53:49,080
Why are you working at a place like this?

2538
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:51,140
Were there no other options?

2539
01:53:52,320 --> 01:53:53,240
I guess not.

2540
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,500
Extremely unclear which parts of the horror are on purpose.

2541
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,060
I know.

2542
01:54:06,140 --> 01:54:07,660
It's just how it turned out for me.

2543
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,180
Things turned out for you?

2544
01:54:09,660 --> 01:54:11,860
You were probably just a neat or something, weren't you?

2545
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:12,860
Why are you so...

2546
01:54:12,860 --> 01:54:14,380
Why is everybody so rude?

2547
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,320
You give off a...

2548
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:19,380
I'm very delicate so I can't work kind of vibe.

2549
01:54:19,600 --> 01:54:21,880
My skin is paper...

2550
01:54:22,360 --> 01:54:23,840
And my bones are glass.

2551
01:54:25,740 --> 01:54:26,980
So you got a man?

2552
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:28,840
M-A-N!

2553
01:54:29,260 --> 01:54:30,260
A man!

2554
01:54:30,260 --> 01:54:32,340
I'm asking if you have a boyfriend.

2555
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:35,680
I don't have one.

2556
01:54:36,060 --> 01:54:37,000
Is that so?

2557
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:38,900
You seem like it.

2558
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:40,800
Oh my god!

2559
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:43,040
Well, even if you had a boyfriend...

2560
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:43,940
He'll probably...

2561
01:54:43,940 --> 01:54:46,280
He's probably a worthless guy.

2562
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:48,320
You'll need to go back to English school.

2563
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:51,520
Someone like that will suit you perfectly.

2564
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:52,840
You don't even know me!

2565
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:59,040
Why is everyone so mean to me?

2566
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,520
Why is everybody so mean to me?

2567
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,480
Why do I just accept this abuse?

2568
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,460
Can I kick her out because she's wearing that hat?

2569
01:55:11,500 --> 01:55:13,180
Can I kick her out because of the hat?

2570
01:55:14,440 --> 01:55:15,540
Hit her with the mop.

2571
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,200
For real.

2572
01:55:20,080 --> 01:55:21,940
Ten gifted if you kick her out.

2573
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:22,580
Lucky.

2574
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:25,240
Wait, where is she going?

2575
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,740
Time to kick her out.

2576
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:29,340
Where did she go?

2577
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,040
Ma'am?

2578
01:55:33,240 --> 01:55:33,720
Lady?

2579
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,040
Where the hell did you go?

2580
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:37,240
Wait!

2581
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:39,900
Are you in here?

2582
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:41,800
What?

2583
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:44,360
Where did she go?

2584
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:48,460
Her hat!

2585
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:55,280
Goku?

2586
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:59,540
Goku, you got the wrong person.

2587
01:56:02,260 --> 01:56:04,040
Oh, this must be the friend.

2588
01:56:04,660 --> 01:56:06,440
Shampoo, body wash, towel, shaver.

2589
01:56:07,220 --> 01:56:07,740
Shampoo.

2590
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:10,340
Body wash.

2591
01:56:11,640 --> 01:56:12,360
What was it?

2592
01:56:12,420 --> 01:56:12,920
Towel?

2593
01:56:14,260 --> 01:56:15,080
Towel shaver.

2594
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,800
You're a new hire.

2595
01:56:27,220 --> 01:56:28,840
My name's Keiichi.

2596
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:28,840
Keiichi.

2597
01:56:30,240 --> 01:56:31,300
Nice to meet you.

2598
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:35,900
Nice to meet you too, Mr. Keiichi-san.

2599
01:56:36,120 --> 01:56:38,060
Let me go check the temperatures for you.

2600
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:42,060
I'm scared though of going in here.

2601
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:42,520
The lady!

2602
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,880
She's completely gone!

2603
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,380
Oh shoot.

2604
01:56:52,580 --> 01:56:53,940
Why did the light do that?

2605
01:56:55,560 --> 01:56:56,440
Oh my god!

2606
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:03,000
Is everything fine for you, sir?

2607
01:57:06,260 --> 01:57:06,760
What?

2608
01:57:06,900 --> 01:57:08,420
Can you wash my back?

2609
01:57:11,780 --> 01:57:13,940
Am I gonna get fired if I don't?

2610
01:57:23,420 --> 01:57:24,040
Do it?

2611
01:57:24,260 --> 01:57:24,540
Okay.

2612
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:26,380
Hey, you say something?

2613
01:57:26,920 --> 01:57:27,800
Say that again.

2614
01:57:28,980 --> 01:57:29,720
It's nothing.

2615
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:30,480
Wait, what?

2616
01:57:30,640 --> 01:57:31,280
What do you mean?

2617
01:57:33,160 --> 01:57:34,420
Hey, you have tattoos!

2618
01:57:34,840 --> 01:57:35,100
Oh...

2619
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:37,580
I can't allow you in here!

2620
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:40,740
Just watching this guy.

2621
01:57:40,820 --> 01:57:41,420
You done?

2622
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,600
Oh, I guess so.

2623
01:57:45,780 --> 01:57:47,100
Let me ask you something.

2624
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,640
Why is a young lady like you working at a place like this?

2625
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:52,780
At least he's not stepping on his back.

2626
01:57:52,860 --> 01:57:53,500
Can you stop?

2627
01:57:56,180 --> 01:57:57,820
I know the bathhouse owner.

2628
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,600
Is that so?

2629
01:58:00,400 --> 01:58:02,400
That old man, is he a relative or something?

2630
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:03,820
Well, that's fine.

2631
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:06,000
You know, this place is owned by my company.

2632
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:08,580
And it's the only reason why it's still standing.

2633
01:58:08,840 --> 01:58:09,900
The owner, well...

2634
01:58:09,900 --> 01:58:11,660
He isn't the most reliable guy, but...

2635
01:58:11,660 --> 01:58:12,820
He follows orders.

2636
01:58:13,140 --> 01:58:13,900
So I let him be.

2637
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:16,700
I even gave him permission for you to be here.

2638
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:17,500
What?

2639
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:19,260
You know that?

2640
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:20,040
What do you mean by that?

2641
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:22,100
But I've changed my mind now that I met you today.

2642
01:58:22,360 --> 01:58:24,980
Now why don't you come to our company instead?

2643
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,560
A fine lady like...

2644
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:26,880
Oh, sure!

2645
01:58:27,580 --> 01:58:29,500
I would treat you very, very well.

2646
01:58:29,600 --> 01:58:30,000
Yeah!

2647
01:58:30,100 --> 01:58:31,220
Get me out of this place!

2648
01:58:32,180 --> 01:58:33,000
No, thank you!

2649
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,660
Oh my god!

2650
01:58:33,740 --> 01:58:34,060
No!

2651
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:34,540
Me!

2652
01:58:34,760 --> 01:58:35,160
What?

2653
01:58:35,180 --> 01:58:36,280
Tashi is so stupid!

2654
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:37,320
What?

2655
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:37,980
Tashi baka!

2656
01:58:40,340 --> 01:58:41,220
Japanese Magneto?

2657
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:45,380
You have the guts to turn down my invitation, huh?

2658
01:58:45,540 --> 01:58:47,000
You got some balls, lady.

2659
01:58:49,140 --> 01:58:51,260
The only problem is that you don't.

2660
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:56,120
And I could easily get you to be sitting on my lap with force.

2661
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:57,940
You know that?

2662
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:02,240
What's happening?

2663
01:59:04,160 --> 01:59:05,380
Keiichi-san, are you okay?

2664
01:59:06,860 --> 01:59:07,480
Keiichi-san?

2665
01:59:10,230 --> 01:59:10,540
Yeah!

2666
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:13,580
The power of the ghost...

2667
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:17,140
is gonna kill you!

2668
01:59:19,560 --> 01:59:20,400
You okay?

2669
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:22,780
You can leave now.

2670
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:26,260
At least he takes his stuff.

2671
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,120
Now get haunted!

2672
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:29,660
Get haunted!

2673
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:30,220
Get haunted!

2674
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,400
Get haunted!

2675
01:59:31,460 --> 01:59:31,960
Get haunted!

2676
01:59:32,020 --> 01:59:32,500
Get haunted!

2677
01:59:34,040 --> 01:59:35,140
Get haunted!

2678
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:35,780
Get haunted!

2679
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:36,340
Get haunted!

2680
01:59:39,120 --> 01:59:41,520
I think I had to have scratched his back.

2681
01:59:41,700 --> 01:59:44,420
I think the game probably wouldn't have let me otherwise.

2682
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:48,460
Goodbye!

2683
01:59:58,730 --> 01:59:59,810
You're no-

2684
02:00:12,080 --> 02:00:13,020
I'm sorry!

2685
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:15,040
You messed up today.

2686
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:19,440
Well, I guess you did okay today.

2687
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,300
Good luck tomorrow.

2688
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:22,280
Do better tomorrow.

2689
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:24,180
By the way, did Keiichi come?

2690
02:00:25,580 --> 02:00:26,920
Oh, by the way, did Keiichi come?

2691
02:00:27,120 --> 02:00:27,740
How was Keiichi-san?

2692
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,380
How was he?

2693
02:00:30,660 --> 02:00:31,860
Did you notice anything unusual?

2694
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:34,440
Did you notice anything unusual?

2695
02:00:35,100 --> 02:00:36,480
He was acting a little strange.

2696
02:00:36,940 --> 02:00:37,140
Oh, I see.

2697
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:39,260
Even Keiichi.

2698
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:40,660
Oh, I see.

2699
02:00:40,780 --> 02:00:41,860
Even Keiichi.

2700
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:44,020
I'm glad I called you, Mayuna-san.

2701
02:00:44,560 --> 02:00:46,580
I'm glad I called you, Mayuna-san.

2702
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:49,420
I'm glad I called you, Mayuna-san.

2703
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:51,080
I guess by the ghost?

2704
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:55,180
Well then, clean up and go home.

2705
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:56,360
Okay.

2706
02:00:57,460 --> 02:00:59,560
Today we clean the walls, right?

2707
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:01,820
Aw, man.

2708
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:04,640
I hope nothing spooky happens.

2709
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:12,680
Is it like this?

2710
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:13,320
See?

2711
02:01:13,900 --> 02:01:14,380
See?

2712
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:15,880
What is this that keeps appearing?

2713
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,780
That makes no- Oh, it's these!

2714
02:01:20,240 --> 02:01:20,880
I'm an idiot.

2715
02:01:21,200 --> 02:01:21,640
Oh, what's this?

2716
02:01:23,140 --> 02:01:25,420
I keep forgetting I can check it here!

2717
02:01:25,940 --> 02:01:28,040
Oh my god, Five Nights at Freddy's, my ass.

2718
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:28,500
What?

2719
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:30,180
No, sir.

2720
02:01:31,360 --> 02:01:32,280
I think I'm good.

2721
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,540
What do I do here?

2722
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:47,240
Oh, I don't like this one.

2723
02:01:51,260 --> 02:01:51,700
Okay.

2724
02:01:53,300 --> 02:01:54,000
Where else?

2725
02:01:54,120 --> 02:01:54,880
Oh, you see over there?

2726
02:01:56,820 --> 02:01:57,820
The Hat Lady.

2727
02:01:59,820 --> 02:02:00,260
Yeah...

2728
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,220
She'll just, um...

2729
02:02:03,640 --> 02:02:05,320
never be seen from again, I guess.

2730
02:02:13,060 --> 02:02:14,400
Here or on the other side?

2731
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:15,260
I think it's the other side.

2732
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:19,660
How did those get on the wall?

2733
02:02:27,720 --> 02:02:28,240
Uh...

2734
02:02:29,100 --> 02:02:29,920
The Hat!

2735
02:02:33,120 --> 02:02:34,060
What you do?

2736
02:02:37,100 --> 02:02:40,220
This part I can't tell if I'm doing it correctly, but...

2737
02:02:42,140 --> 02:02:43,080
Fighting Goku.

2738
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:45,840
That lady?

2739
02:02:45,980 --> 02:02:47,360
We didn't know she's Chi-Chi.

2740
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:53,580
I opened this door and I'm scared of it.

2741
02:02:56,720 --> 02:02:58,840
Am I going to be able to sleep tonight?

2742
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,420
I hope I don't have nightmares.

2743
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:03,840
Oh!

2744
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,240
That doesn't look very clean.

2745
02:03:07,160 --> 02:03:08,880
Did the desk bell ring?

2746
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:09,380
Did it?

2747
02:03:09,480 --> 02:03:10,140
I didn't hear it.

2748
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:13,160
Let me see.

2749
02:03:13,480 --> 02:03:14,560
That looks like hair.

2750
02:03:14,780 --> 02:03:16,220
That looks like a scary ghost lady.

2751
02:03:16,220 --> 02:03:19,360
When I said 10 gifted if you kicked her out, I didn't know that was going to happen.

2752
02:03:22,220 --> 02:03:23,020
Well, um...

2753
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:26,180
It didn't, right?

2754
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:26,980
I didn't hear it.

2755
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:27,820
Oh wait, who's...

2756
02:03:27,820 --> 02:03:29,140
Oh, that's the Hat Lady.

2757
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,100
Her stuff is still here.

2758
02:03:34,680 --> 02:03:36,440
There's smoke coming from the boiler room!

2759
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,500
Let me go check.

2760
02:03:37,680 --> 02:03:38,280
That's a person.

2761
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:43,800
That's just a... Oh my god, is the lady in the boiler?

2762
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:46,080
Wait... Hat Lady!

2763
02:03:51,250 --> 02:03:51,970
Ma'am?

2764
02:03:52,590 --> 02:03:54,230
Why are you setting my place on...

2765
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:55,470
Oh, she's getting hugged.

2766
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:55,630
Oh!

2767
02:03:55,830 --> 02:03:57,730
She's getting dragged away.

2768
02:03:59,590 --> 02:04:00,950
What did you burn?

2769
02:04:01,790 --> 02:04:04,370
You're messing up my whole... everything.

2770
02:04:04,510 --> 02:04:05,230
What is that?

2771
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:10,770
I guess it's fine.

2772
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:12,370
Oh my god!

2773
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:16,390
Uh...

2774
02:04:16,930 --> 02:04:18,390
What happened here?

2775
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:21,350
What happened here?

2776
02:04:21,350 --> 02:04:21,350
Hat!

2777
02:04:21,890 --> 02:04:22,290
Lady!

2778
02:04:23,850 --> 02:04:25,290
There was smoke coming out!

2779
02:04:25,470 --> 02:04:25,650
Oh!

2780
02:04:27,630 --> 02:04:28,410
His eyes.

2781
02:04:28,710 --> 02:04:29,350
What happened to him?

2782
02:04:29,730 --> 02:04:31,210
I didn't... Sorry, I clicked too fast.

2783
02:04:31,310 --> 02:04:32,090
I think he said it happens.

2784
02:04:32,510 --> 02:04:33,290
I'll fix it.

2785
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:36,210
Go take a bath in the meantime.

2786
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:38,110
And then go home.

2787
02:04:39,170 --> 02:04:39,570
Okay.

2788
02:04:43,210 --> 02:04:44,150
I'll go take a bath.

2789
02:04:44,150 --> 02:04:45,970
I'm not even gonna think about it.

2790
02:04:48,070 --> 02:04:49,490
Bath time for me!

2791
02:04:51,130 --> 02:04:53,610
I'm not even... I got my razor and everything.

2792
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:56,290
Face down.

2793
02:05:05,080 --> 02:05:05,680
Yes?

2794
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:12,500
I know... Oh god, she's gonna jump at me because I'm ignoring her!

2795
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:14,400
I know...

2796
02:05:14,400 --> 02:05:16,020
I know...

2797
02:05:16,020 --> 02:05:16,800
I know...

2798
02:05:24,460 --> 02:05:26,320
I'll take my time in the bath today.

2799
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:26,760
Really?

2800
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:28,920
Are we insane?

2801
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,080
What is wrong with the bath?

2802
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,420
I think there's...

2803
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:34,020
Okay.

2804
02:05:35,180 --> 02:05:38,320
I'll take my time in the goo today.

2805
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:43,140
Is this it?

2806
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:44,000
Is this all I do?

2807
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:46,520
I'm having my back against the wall.

2808
02:05:49,850 --> 02:05:50,910
Can I leave?

2809
02:05:54,380 --> 02:05:54,980
Ah!

2810
02:05:55,340 --> 02:05:58,380
Excuse me, is anyone there?

2811
02:06:02,440 --> 02:06:04,180
Oh, you're from yesterday.

2812
02:06:04,340 --> 02:06:04,740
What happened?

2813
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:08,080
I'm an employee here.

2814
02:06:09,460 --> 02:06:11,600
Um, can you throw the duck where you went?

2815
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:17,120
Why are you bathing in the men's area?

2816
02:06:17,420 --> 02:06:18,940
There's a rubber duckie by you.

2817
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:19,880
Could you throw it back to me?

2818
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:20,640
Rubber duckie?

2819
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:20,640
Sure.

2820
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:22,160
Where?

2821
02:06:22,940 --> 02:06:23,700
Rubber duckie?

2822
02:06:25,540 --> 02:06:27,100
Do you guys see a rubber duckie?

2823
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:27,820
Oh, here.

2824
02:06:30,460 --> 02:06:31,860
How do I grab it?

2825
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:33,880
Oh, there we go.

2826
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:36,360
Hold on.

2827
02:06:36,980 --> 02:06:38,240
I have butterfingers.

2828
02:06:40,580 --> 02:06:41,260
Hold on!

2829
02:06:44,780 --> 02:06:46,620
Is this supposed to be like this?

2830
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:51,220
Hold on!

2831
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:53,720
Oh, I got it, I got it, I got it.

2832
02:06:54,620 --> 02:06:55,060
Call me.

2833
02:06:56,740 --> 02:06:59,480
Oh, I think I just threw it into the window.

2834
02:07:00,680 --> 02:07:01,040
What?

2835
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:01,780
What just happened?

2836
02:07:09,290 --> 02:07:09,870
There we go.

2837
02:07:13,090 --> 02:07:13,750
You're welcome!

2838
02:07:17,820 --> 02:07:18,180
What?

2839
02:07:20,240 --> 02:07:20,600
Stop!

2840
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:22,920
Sorry.

2841
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:27,840
Is there someone over there?

2842
02:07:28,360 --> 02:07:28,840
What?

2843
02:07:28,980 --> 02:07:29,620
Yes, I'm here.

2844
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,420
I'm an employee here.

2845
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,420
Could you throw that duckie by a...

2846
02:07:41,160 --> 02:07:41,640
Sure.

2847
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:45,540
I can't grab it, lady.

2848
02:07:45,880 --> 02:07:47,760
My game, I think, is kind of bugged.

2849
02:07:54,810 --> 02:07:57,270
Is the water red or is it just me?

2850
02:07:58,370 --> 02:07:59,130
I know.

2851
02:08:00,370 --> 02:08:01,250
Oh, I can leave?

2852
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:04,070
Oh, oh, I'm supposed to throw it this way.

2853
02:08:04,590 --> 02:08:05,230
Just kidding.

2854
02:08:05,370 --> 02:08:05,690
Sorry.

2855
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:08,190
She's not there anymore.

2856
02:08:09,910 --> 02:08:11,890
Why do you need the rubber duckie over there?

2857
02:08:11,890 --> 02:08:12,230
Oh, gosh.

2858
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:13,910
Oh, I can't grab her duckie.

2859
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:16,870
I think my game is bugged.

2860
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:18,210
Lady, please.

2861
02:08:20,490 --> 02:08:23,990
Oh, I keep messing up.

2862
02:08:24,750 --> 02:08:25,330
Come on.

2863
02:08:28,980 --> 02:08:29,380
Nice.

2864
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:32,060
I know.

2865
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:34,520
My hat's over there.

2866
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:34,960
Could you...

2867
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:36,180
Stop!

2868
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:42,820
I don't like this.

2869
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:47,320
This one's really off-putting.

2870
02:08:48,860 --> 02:08:50,520
We've been talking to each other.

2871
02:08:59,120 --> 02:09:00,900
Could you throw it back to me?

2872
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:02,880
Okay.

2873
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:05,320
I know.

2874
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,900
Oh, it's like really off-putting because I feel like she's moving around everywhere and it's scaring me.

2875
02:09:12,740 --> 02:09:14,700
Can I pick up this damn thing?

2876
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:15,920
Why can't I pick up this?

2877
02:09:16,040 --> 02:09:18,060
I have the most butterfingers ever.

2878
02:09:19,820 --> 02:09:22,140
I can't pick up your damn duckie.

2879
02:09:27,570 --> 02:09:28,910
Oh, my God.

2880
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:30,710
Come on.

2881
02:09:32,510 --> 02:09:33,690
Yeah, she is kind of scary.

2882
02:09:33,690 --> 02:09:35,090
She's kind of getting closer, isn't she?

2883
02:09:36,810 --> 02:09:37,570
Oh, there we go.

2884
02:09:37,690 --> 02:09:38,050
Okay, okay.

2885
02:09:38,250 --> 02:09:38,710
Ew!

2886
02:09:38,850 --> 02:09:39,630
It's covered in hair!

2887
02:09:40,870 --> 02:09:42,010
Oh, I messed it up.

2888
02:09:43,990 --> 02:09:45,270
I don't know where to go.

2889
02:09:46,370 --> 02:09:46,830
Oh.

2890
02:09:47,770 --> 02:09:48,230
Ew!

2891
02:09:50,990 --> 02:09:51,450
Ew!

2892
02:09:51,710 --> 02:09:52,350
Oh, my God.

2893
02:09:52,830 --> 02:09:53,010
It's...

2894
02:09:55,890 --> 02:09:58,570
It's got a little... a little toupee.

2895
02:09:58,950 --> 02:10:00,690
A little toupee.

2896
02:10:00,690 --> 02:10:01,690
A little toupee.

2897
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:05,670
A little toupee.

2898
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:05,870
I can see your hair now.

2899
02:10:06,070 --> 02:10:06,610
Don't..

2900
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:07,570
Don't come back, please.

2901
02:10:07,750 --> 02:10:08,610
Don't come back, please!

2902
02:10:22,100 --> 02:10:24,260
It's got sideburns and everything.

2903
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:26,420
Oh, my God, he's really gross now.

2904
02:10:28,080 --> 02:10:29,440
Oh, he's really gross.

2905
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:31,480
Is he getting bigger or just me?

2906
02:10:34,980 --> 02:10:35,260
Hello?

2907
02:10:35,580 --> 02:10:36,440
Can I leave?

2908
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:38,920
No, I can't get out.

2909
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:41,920
Hello!

2910
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,080
Oh, no!

2911
02:10:47,850 --> 02:10:48,870
Oh my god.

2912
02:10:49,570 --> 02:10:49,970
Ducky.

2913
02:10:50,930 --> 02:10:51,330
Please.

2914
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:53,390
Please, rubber ducky.

2915
02:10:58,040 --> 02:10:58,620
What was that?

2916
02:10:58,720 --> 02:10:59,380
Oh, there it is.

2917
02:11:00,620 --> 02:11:02,540
Wow, he's actually properly like...

2918
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:04,140
Oh my god.

2919
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:06,020
Am I supposed to grab him?

2920
02:11:06,660 --> 02:11:08,540
Anime guy, thank you for my push-up.

2921
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:14,980
What was that?

2922
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:18,240
What was that noise?

2923
02:11:18,240 --> 02:11:20,380
Um, excuse me.

2924
02:11:21,940 --> 02:11:24,660
I'm a staff here.

2925
02:11:25,480 --> 02:11:30,500
Um, can you throw the duck over there to me?

2926
02:11:32,440 --> 02:11:33,480
Um...

2927
02:11:34,200 --> 02:11:36,000
Over there?

2928
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:40,180
I wish I could... okay.

2929
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:45,940
Oh my god.

2930
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:53,400
Oh my god, she threw her wig at me!

2931
02:11:57,420 --> 02:11:58,800
Thanks, rubber duck.

2932
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:00,620
She threw her wig at me!

2933
02:12:02,020 --> 02:12:04,080
Oh, is that her?

2934
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:04,980
Oh.

2935
02:12:06,120 --> 02:12:09,660
Oh my god.

2936
02:12:13,240 --> 02:12:14,700
Please keep praying.

2937
02:12:15,580 --> 02:12:18,780
Please keep praying for my bathhouse.

2938
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:22,660
Okay.

2939
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:27,180
I know.

2940
02:12:28,060 --> 02:12:29,440
Five more minutes.

2941
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:32,820
I don't wanna go!

2942
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:33,640
I don't wanna go!

2943
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:41,180
Get

2944
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:48,820
out of here, Kevin!

2945
02:12:53,540 --> 02:12:54,480
Thank you.

2946
02:13:00,130 --> 02:13:01,410
Oh my god.

2947
02:13:01,550 --> 02:13:02,130
Thank you.

2948
02:13:05,190 --> 02:13:05,690
Oh.

2949
02:13:09,170 --> 02:13:10,810
Get out of here.

2950
02:13:15,780 --> 02:13:16,380
Fishmire.

2951
02:13:17,940 --> 02:13:18,780
Thank you.

2952
02:13:23,770 --> 02:13:26,070
That was biggest jump scare so far.

2953
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:31,630
I shouldn't have accepted the job.

2954
02:13:31,810 --> 02:13:32,470
You can still quit.

2955
02:13:32,690 --> 02:13:33,350
You can still quit.

2956
02:13:34,050 --> 02:13:34,950
Just quit.

2957
02:13:35,470 --> 02:13:36,370
Just quit.

2958
02:13:37,170 --> 02:13:37,770
Oh.

2959
02:13:37,770 --> 02:13:37,850
Oh.

2960
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:41,090
Someone's knocking at my door.

2961
02:13:49,300 --> 02:13:49,820
Sweater?

2962
02:13:49,820 --> 02:13:50,340
Blue.

2963
02:13:51,460 --> 02:13:52,920
Oh, these ones are so cute!

2964
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,600
More Uniqlo.

2965
02:13:57,580 --> 02:13:58,460
Knock, knock, knock.

2966
02:13:58,780 --> 02:13:59,320
Anybody here?

2967
02:13:59,820 --> 02:14:00,540
Oh my god!

2968
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:01,680
Oh my god!

2969
02:14:02,120 --> 02:14:02,980
Hello, sir?

2970
02:14:08,120 --> 02:14:10,280
Why am I letting him inside my house?

2971
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:11,080
Oh, okay.

2972
02:14:14,980 --> 02:14:16,160
How are you?

2973
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:17,320
Did you sleep well?

2974
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:20,980
Probably yesterday.

2975
02:14:21,620 --> 02:14:23,240
Um, the bathhouse is haunted.

2976
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:25,080
Scary things happened yesterday.

2977
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:27,780
I heard a woman's voice saying she was an employee.

2978
02:14:29,040 --> 02:14:30,880
Oh, which one should we pick, you guys?

2979
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:35,020
I don't think we should be so direct about saying it's haunted.

2980
02:14:35,120 --> 02:14:35,920
I think he'll be like, nah.

2981
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:42,580
I don't know.

2982
02:14:46,060 --> 02:14:46,540
Three?

2983
02:14:46,720 --> 02:14:47,700
I was thinking three, yeah.

2984
02:14:52,940 --> 02:14:55,740
This thing... these kinds of things happen time to time.

2985
02:14:58,780 --> 02:15:00,380
And the... because it's the countryside?

2986
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:09,220
You see spirits and the like appear.

2987
02:15:11,260 --> 02:15:13,260
Usually, there aren't many people around.

2988
02:15:13,800 --> 02:15:16,280
Oh, in places where there are fewer people around.

2989
02:15:16,840 --> 02:15:18,080
So, he knows?

2990
02:15:18,860 --> 02:15:20,680
This village is not haunted by spirits.

2991
02:15:22,500 --> 02:15:25,960
Wait, then you should definitely have two people working at a time.

2992
02:15:26,860 --> 02:15:29,600
That's what happens in a rural place like here, too.

2993
02:15:30,020 --> 02:15:32,660
Ah, but... what do you think?

2994
02:15:33,480 --> 02:15:34,880
Ah, but yeah.

2995
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:37,480
If it's a curse or a spirit...

2996
02:15:38,060 --> 02:15:39,440
W-w-w-what?

2997
02:15:39,660 --> 02:15:40,860
N-n-no-no-no-no-no-no!

2998
02:15:40,860 --> 02:15:42,540
Wait, I did not mention a curse.

2999
02:15:43,540 --> 02:15:45,480
If you're talking about curses and spirits...

3000
02:15:49,340 --> 02:15:51,620
Before you head to work, try the nearby shrine.

3001
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:56,660
A priest should be there to help you.

3002
02:15:56,740 --> 02:15:57,580
Go talk to him!

3003
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:03,820
I'm sure that priest could do something about it.

3004
02:16:07,480 --> 02:16:11,240
I'm worried for you, Myna-san.

3005
02:16:11,700 --> 02:16:14,280
And it's important for you to work without stress, you hear me?

3006
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,300
So, please go.

3007
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:23,000
What do you mean, we're almost there?

3008
02:16:23,080 --> 02:16:23,980
What do you mean by that?

3009
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,200
What do you mean?

3010
02:16:27,320 --> 02:16:28,720
We're almost there, but what?

3011
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:34,100
Now, off we go.

3012
02:16:35,300 --> 02:16:35,740
Okay.

3013
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:38,680
Okay.

3014
02:16:39,720 --> 02:16:40,420
What the?

3015
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:42,380
Did you leave that?

3016
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:43,420
Is that mine?

3017
02:16:46,220 --> 02:16:46,540
Okay.

3018
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,300
We're almost there?

3019
02:16:48,620 --> 02:16:50,000
To turning 24?

3020
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:52,000
Oh, I was going to say...

3021
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:55,260
We're almost there to Mintos 3.0.

3022
02:16:57,380 --> 02:16:59,640
To re-debut stream.

3023
02:17:03,540 --> 02:17:04,760
But you know, whatever.

3024
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:07,160
We saw that guy.

3025
02:17:07,480 --> 02:17:07,920
We saw him.

3026
02:17:10,240 --> 02:17:10,800
Sayuri.

3027
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:17,430
Imagine if there was like a ghost lady up there or something.

3028
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,610
Which way was the shrine?

3029
02:17:21,590 --> 02:17:23,190
Oh, they cleaned up all the flowers.

3030
02:17:25,170 --> 02:17:25,910
Oh, here?

3031
02:17:28,390 --> 02:17:28,950
Hello?

3032
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:29,990
Oh.

3033
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:31,210
Hello?

3034
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:32,690
Who?

3035
02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:37,130
Here, the bath house is no higher.

3036
02:17:37,210 --> 02:17:37,810
Wait a second.

3037
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:41,190
I think I remember the story a little bit from the original now.

3038
02:17:43,750 --> 02:17:44,990
I think I remember.

3039
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:51,480
A little bit.

3040
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:53,400
Because of the priest.

3041
02:17:56,120 --> 02:17:57,240
I won't say it though.

3042
02:18:00,120 --> 02:18:02,100
Just in case it's a spoiler for this too.

3043
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:04,740
My name is Maina.

3044
02:18:05,880 --> 02:18:06,520
Maina-san.

3045
02:18:08,100 --> 02:18:10,980
You speak of how nice of you to come to this village.

3046
02:18:10,980 --> 02:18:12,360
Ah, you're so smart.

3047
02:18:12,820 --> 02:18:15,040
Have we met before?

3048
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:16,340
Have we met before?

3049
02:18:19,440 --> 02:18:20,200
Have we met before?

3050
02:18:20,200 --> 02:18:21,800
Do I look like someone you know?

3051
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,180
I don't know about that.

3052
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:25,920
Hmm, perhaps?

3053
02:18:26,780 --> 02:18:28,300
Is there something troubling you?

3054
02:18:29,680 --> 02:18:32,320
You look like you need some help spiritually.

3055
02:18:34,200 --> 02:18:36,440
I'm spiritually burdened.

3056
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:39,200
This is what my ghost therapist says.

3057
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:40,720
Because... if I had one.

3058
02:18:42,240 --> 02:18:44,820
Um, strange things happen at the bathhouse.

3059
02:18:49,100 --> 02:18:50,300
Strange things.

3060
02:18:50,740 --> 02:18:53,300
Well, unfortunately, I do know what you mean.

3061
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:59,820
I sense evil wrapped around you.

3062
02:19:03,940 --> 02:19:07,920
And it seems to have intensified since your arrival to this village.

3063
02:19:14,640 --> 02:19:22,280
Well, for now, I shall bless you with the power of the Yaoyorozu gods.

3064
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:24,920
Did he just take my money?

3065
02:19:25,460 --> 02:19:26,220
Oh, never mind.

3066
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:30,300
Keep this amulet with you at all times.

3067
02:19:33,600 --> 02:19:36,360
May the Yaoyorozu light your way.

3068
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:38,920
Oh, thank you!

3069
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,820
We have this bracelet and the charm.

3070
02:19:44,780 --> 02:19:45,900
My omamori.

3071
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:49,400
Thank you.

3072
02:19:49,500 --> 02:19:50,880
I'll keep it with me.

3073
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:52,200
Bye bye.

3074
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:54,720
Any monkeys about?

3075
02:20:00,300 --> 02:20:01,380
Hidden Vtuber.

3076
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:04,200
Oh my god.

3077
02:20:04,580 --> 02:20:06,720
I'm getting stuck on the walls for Vtubers.

3078
02:20:09,240 --> 02:20:12,360
Okay, to work, I guess.

3079
02:20:15,580 --> 02:20:16,020
Yeah.

3080
02:20:19,240 --> 02:20:20,760
Oh, I thought he was going to keep talking.

3081
02:20:21,060 --> 02:20:21,840
Are you okay?

3082
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:23,200
Are you an employee here?

3083
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:25,480
I was called to repair the stove.

3084
02:20:25,800 --> 02:20:26,800
And I just finished.

3085
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:29,840
This place... something is...

3086
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:30,060
What?

3087
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,920
I don't ever want to come back.

3088
02:20:33,520 --> 02:20:36,020
That stove is fine, so never call me here again.

3089
02:20:36,020 --> 02:20:36,420
Oh.

3090
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:38,320
Okay.

3091
02:20:38,620 --> 02:20:40,340
Can I also leave?

3092
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:41,760
Or...

3093
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:44,180
The job is not done.

3094
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:46,180
He's doing the Shokolov...

3095
02:20:46,180 --> 02:20:47,800
The Shokolov shuffle?

3096
02:20:48,940 --> 02:20:50,040
Oh, that was fast.

3097
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:51,420
Oh.

3098
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:52,200
Grandpa.

3099
02:20:52,460 --> 02:20:52,960
Grandma?

3100
02:20:54,480 --> 02:20:55,120
Shampoo.

3101
02:20:55,780 --> 02:20:56,740
Wet wipes.

3102
02:20:56,880 --> 02:20:57,320
Body wash.

3103
02:20:57,540 --> 02:20:58,560
Why do you need the shampoo?

3104
02:20:59,440 --> 02:21:00,520
Wet wipes.

3105
02:21:01,140 --> 02:21:02,060
Body wash.

3106
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:05,580
Can I come in?

3107
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:07,380
Can I come in?

3108
02:21:07,820 --> 02:21:08,960
Will you listen?

3109
02:21:09,840 --> 02:21:12,140
I promised to meet a friend here today.

3110
02:21:12,340 --> 02:21:14,360
But that person developed dementia.

3111
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:17,760
Which is why I'm worried.

3112
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:18,700
Which is why I'm worried.

3113
02:21:18,700 --> 02:21:18,720
Oh!

3114
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:20,000
Okay.

3115
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:22,480
Okay.

3116
02:21:29,330 --> 02:21:31,990
What do you want me to do about it though?

3117
02:21:32,330 --> 02:21:32,430
What do you want me to do about it though?

3118
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:33,590
.

3119
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:36,570
Okay.

3120
02:21:36,570 --> 02:21:37,930
Let's switch to 4.

3121
02:21:38,950 --> 02:21:39,810
Oh, we're on 4.

3122
02:21:39,950 --> 02:21:40,750
Let's go to 1.

3123
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:46,090
Are you gonna be normal?

3124
02:21:47,810 --> 02:21:48,930
Okay, I think she's normal.

3125
02:21:52,210 --> 02:21:52,650
Hello!

3126
02:21:53,910 --> 02:21:54,550
I'm here.

3127
02:21:56,330 --> 02:21:57,350
Shampoo, body wash.

3128
02:21:57,590 --> 02:21:57,850
Yeah.

3129
02:21:58,190 --> 02:22:00,410
I don't think you want our crappy shampoo.

3130
02:22:00,570 --> 02:22:01,450
I think you need...

3131
02:22:02,230 --> 02:22:03,890
You use the nice stuff.

3132
02:22:04,390 --> 02:22:05,930
I think she's the one with dementia.

3133
02:22:05,930 --> 02:22:06,230
No!

3134
02:22:09,650 --> 02:22:12,090
Bathhouse are good for my beauty.

3135
02:22:15,150 --> 02:22:15,870
Okay.

3136
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:20,570
Don't use our crappy shampoo though.

3137
02:22:20,830 --> 02:22:22,510
I think it'll ruin your hair.

3138
02:22:24,670 --> 02:22:25,470
What the?

3139
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,210
Oh, that was weird.

3140
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:30,450
Oh my god!

3141
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:31,590
Sir!

3142
02:22:33,170 --> 02:22:34,210
Why me?

3143
02:22:35,930 --> 02:22:36,870
I didn't do anything.

3144
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:39,270
This is discrimination against women.

3145
02:22:39,910 --> 02:22:40,530
What?

3146
02:22:43,470 --> 02:22:46,210
I'm gonna get banned off of YouTube if I see your tits then.

3147
02:22:46,470 --> 02:22:46,810
No!

3148
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:51,450
You can't have your boobs out on my channel.

3149
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:56,110
That's why I made you leave.

3150
02:22:58,150 --> 02:22:59,650
Body wash shaver.

3151
02:23:03,900 --> 02:23:05,500
Oh, what about your friend?

3152
02:23:06,740 --> 02:23:08,460
Maybe I should wait for them.

3153
02:23:08,700 --> 02:23:08,960
Okay.

3154
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:10,400
What?

3155
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:11,700
What?

3156
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:12,820
What do you mean what?

3157
02:23:13,080 --> 02:23:14,280
Don't stare at me.

3158
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:14,920
I'm just... What?

3159
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,660
I didn't do anything.

3160
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:18,960
Everybody is so mean to me.

3161
02:23:20,600 --> 02:23:23,800
When people are like, Mint, why don't you just move to Japan?

3162
02:23:24,020 --> 02:23:26,420
Because this is what will happen.

3163
02:23:29,240 --> 02:23:31,380
This is what will happen.

3164
02:23:35,240 --> 02:23:36,460
This is what will happen.

3165
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:37,180
What's going on in here, right?

3166
02:23:39,140 --> 02:23:39,820
Oh my god.

3167
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:43,540
I learned that you don't have to buy separate shampoo, body wash, conditioner.

3168
02:23:43,760 --> 02:23:44,620
You can just buy it from...

3169
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:44,720
No!

3170
02:23:45,080 --> 02:23:45,820
What do you mean?

3171
02:23:45,940 --> 02:23:47,020
I didn't teach you that!

3172
02:23:51,850 --> 02:23:52,870
Is that her?

3173
02:23:54,010 --> 02:23:54,650
Who is...

3174
02:23:55,650 --> 02:23:57,250
Oh my god, that scared me.

3175
02:24:00,890 --> 02:24:02,370
Oh shit, okay, she's going in there.

3176
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:03,830
Oh my god!

3177
02:24:04,210 --> 02:24:06,550
We got double, double spooky lady!

3178
02:24:08,210 --> 02:24:09,530
Double spooky lady!

3179
02:24:09,910 --> 02:24:11,350
Oh, let's also check...

3180
02:24:11,350 --> 02:24:12,770
Oh my gosh, the men's...

3181
02:24:13,390 --> 02:24:14,730
Okay, the ladies is fine.

3182
02:24:14,930 --> 02:24:15,530
One second!

3183
02:24:15,790 --> 02:24:17,550
Hold on, I have to go take care of you.

3184
02:24:19,050 --> 02:24:21,070
I have to go take care of your water first.

3185
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:24,930
Oh, wrong door.

3186
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:29,460
Oh my gosh.

3187
02:24:29,720 --> 02:24:30,740
It's so dark.

3188
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:34,200
Hold on.

3189
02:24:34,760 --> 02:24:38,280
One second, it's too cold for you to go into the...

3190
02:24:38,280 --> 02:24:39,000
Enjoy the bath.

3191
02:24:39,640 --> 02:24:41,780
It's too cold for you to enjoy the bath.

3192
02:24:42,280 --> 02:24:43,840
I must set it on fire.

3193
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:46,300
I must set it on fire.

3194
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:47,680
Okay.

3195
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:49,420
That should be good, right?

3196
02:24:50,300 --> 02:24:51,300
Yeah, that should be good.

3197
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:51,660
Okay.

3198
02:24:52,300 --> 02:24:53,000
Where's the door?

3199
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:55,240
Why can't we get better lights in here?

3200
02:24:57,500 --> 02:24:58,080
Okay, okay.

3201
02:24:59,060 --> 02:25:00,140
More, more, more.

3202
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:02,460
Fire, fire, fire!

3203
02:25:03,300 --> 02:25:03,700
Okay.

3204
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:04,440
Hi, sorry.

3205
02:25:05,080 --> 02:25:05,480
Towel.

3206
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:08,120
He doesn't look very happy with me, you guys.

3207
02:25:09,080 --> 02:25:11,060
He doesn't look very happy with me.

3208
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,120
Chirapin.

3209
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:15,640
Chirapin.

3210
02:25:16,180 --> 02:25:16,700
Chirachirachirapin.

3211
02:25:17,080 --> 02:25:17,600
Chirachirapipi.

3212
02:25:18,900 --> 02:25:19,420
Chirapin.

3213
02:25:20,300 --> 02:25:20,820
Chirachirachira.

3214
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:22,180
Chiratekesu.

3215
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,620
Uh...

3216
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:27,980
Men's get a taste of her own medicine when she is the one who's hated for...

3217
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:28,740
What are you talking about?

3218
02:25:33,640 --> 02:25:34,160
Chirapin?

3219
02:25:34,300 --> 02:25:35,180
Ah, sorry.

3220
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:37,440
You are not a Chirapin.

3221
02:25:38,740 --> 02:25:40,240
Chirakesu follower yet.

3222
02:25:41,180 --> 02:25:41,740
Chiratekesu.

3223
02:25:42,820 --> 02:25:43,380
Chiratekesu?

3224
02:25:44,300 --> 02:25:44,860
Chirapin!

3225
02:25:45,360 --> 02:25:47,880
You aren't familiar with Chiratekesu?

3226
02:25:48,700 --> 02:25:50,680
Is that like a mascot or something?

3227
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,360
That is a troublesome matter.

3228
02:25:55,100 --> 02:25:57,740
Chiratekesu is always right next to each one of us.

3229
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,880
Its existence is like a god.

3230
02:26:00,140 --> 02:26:01,960
No, it is more than a god.

3231
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:07,420
Peace in this world is maintained by Chiratekesu.

3232
02:26:07,420 --> 02:26:09,440
And us becoming one.

3233
02:26:10,220 --> 02:26:13,120
In other words, it is our peace and our own tranquility.

3234
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:18,760
It is through Chiratekesu that we are released from all pain and sadness.

3235
02:26:18,880 --> 02:26:21,060
Can you just go take a bath, please?

3236
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:23,300
And that allows us to reach a new realm.

3237
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:24,620
I see.

3238
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:25,080
Chipinke.

3239
02:26:25,720 --> 02:26:26,160
Chipinke!

3240
02:26:27,380 --> 02:26:28,560
Do you understand now?

3241
02:26:28,920 --> 02:26:34,380
The important thing that is needed is to become one with Chiratekesu.

3242
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:35,560
Is O.

3243
02:26:36,380 --> 02:26:36,820
Yes.

3244
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:39,600
This witch contains the soul of Chiratekesu.

3245
02:26:39,640 --> 02:26:40,400
It is kind of cute though.

3246
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:45,340
It is normally forbidden for non-believers to have it.

3247
02:26:45,480 --> 02:26:47,340
But today I will give you a special offer.

3248
02:26:47,520 --> 02:26:49,460
You can have it for one million yen!

3249
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,720
I don't have that kind of money.

3250
02:26:53,260 --> 02:26:53,700
Chirapin.

3251
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:55,240
Chiratekesu.

3252
02:26:55,760 --> 02:26:56,520
How unfortunate.

3253
02:26:57,120 --> 02:27:01,480
Even if you cry and beg later, Chiratekesu will not accept and welcome you.

3254
02:27:01,720 --> 02:27:04,560
You will trudge on the same path as one before.

3255
02:27:04,960 --> 02:27:06,140
You shall regret this.

3256
02:27:06,140 --> 02:27:06,940
Chirapin.

3257
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,580
I am a Vtuber and you will regret this.

3258
02:27:10,060 --> 02:27:10,480
Chirapin.

3259
02:27:10,700 --> 02:27:11,120
Chirapin.

3260
02:27:13,640 --> 02:27:15,960
Just go take a bath, man.

3261
02:27:18,900 --> 02:27:20,540
Is this lady still in here?

3262
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:23,080
Are you okay?

3263
02:27:25,240 --> 02:27:25,940
Oh my god!

3264
02:27:27,980 --> 02:27:29,640
It can't be helped, can it?

3265
02:27:29,680 --> 02:27:31,540
You can't sleep in here when I go into a sauna.

3266
02:27:31,660 --> 02:27:32,320
It makes me sleepy.

3267
02:27:32,740 --> 02:27:33,760
Get out of here!

3268
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:36,020
You can't be sleepy.

3269
02:27:36,020 --> 02:27:36,560
Why are you sleeping in here?

3270
02:27:37,320 --> 02:27:38,180
Ma'am!

3271
02:27:39,120 --> 02:27:40,080
You're gonna die.

3272
02:27:45,770 --> 02:27:46,250
Chirapin.

3273
02:27:46,290 --> 02:27:46,530
Oh.

3274
02:27:47,510 --> 02:27:48,290
Oh my god.

3275
02:27:48,410 --> 02:27:48,670
Hello.

3276
02:27:48,930 --> 02:27:49,550
Hold on.

3277
02:27:49,570 --> 02:27:52,290
Let me double check to make sure this weirdo's not doing anything.

3278
02:27:53,790 --> 02:27:54,270
Oh.

3279
02:27:55,010 --> 02:27:56,270
Are you alo- Chirapin.

3280
02:27:57,990 --> 02:27:58,470
Chirapin.

3281
02:27:59,550 --> 02:28:01,130
The Chiratekesu is broken.

3282
02:28:01,490 --> 02:28:02,730
He is very angry.

3283
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:04,230
It's because of your sins.

3284
02:28:04,570 --> 02:28:05,970
You must have offended him.

3285
02:28:06,350 --> 02:28:07,230
You are finished.

3286
02:28:07,710 --> 02:28:08,190
Done.

3287
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:08,330
Chirapin.

3288
02:28:08,350 --> 02:28:11,570
You must suffer the wrath of the Chiratekesu.

3289
02:28:12,030 --> 02:28:14,430
An unimaginable death is now on your way.

3290
02:28:14,770 --> 02:28:15,090
Oh.

3291
02:28:15,630 --> 02:28:16,190
Okay.

3292
02:28:16,250 --> 02:28:16,410
Good.

3293
02:28:16,450 --> 02:28:16,810
He's leaving.

3294
02:28:17,050 --> 02:28:17,610
Oh.

3295
02:28:19,330 --> 02:28:19,890
Okay.

3296
02:28:20,530 --> 02:28:22,170
We're done-zo, you guys.

3297
02:28:25,690 --> 02:28:26,590
Wet wipes.

3298
02:28:26,790 --> 02:28:27,450
Body wash.

3299
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:27,970
Shampoo.

3300
02:28:29,230 --> 02:28:30,170
Wet wipes.

3301
02:28:31,330 --> 02:28:32,250
Body wash.

3302
02:28:33,930 --> 02:28:34,490
Shampoo.

3303
02:28:35,490 --> 02:28:37,470
He's making a lot of noise over there.

3304
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:41,850
Why are we getting all these freaks for?

3305
02:28:41,990 --> 02:28:45,150
I'm an expert in palm reading for newt telling.

3306
02:28:47,710 --> 02:28:48,770
Your hand, please.

3307
02:28:48,810 --> 02:28:49,930
Let me read your palm.

3308
02:28:50,070 --> 02:28:50,250
No!

3309
02:28:50,890 --> 02:28:52,450
Go take a bath!

3310
02:28:52,750 --> 02:28:53,290
Actually, what?

3311
02:28:53,350 --> 02:28:53,570
Sure.

3312
02:28:54,470 --> 02:28:56,470
Hands so beautiful and smooth.

3313
02:28:56,830 --> 02:28:59,610
It's been a long time since I've held a woman's hands.

3314
02:29:02,570 --> 02:29:03,050
Okay.

3315
02:29:04,850 --> 02:29:05,950
Let me see.

3316
02:29:06,150 --> 02:29:06,630
Oh.

3317
02:29:06,810 --> 02:29:06,910
Oh.

3318
02:29:07,470 --> 02:29:09,450
You seem to have a deep connection with this village.

3319
02:29:09,570 --> 02:29:09,850
I do?

3320
02:29:11,050 --> 02:29:11,830
Oh my god.

3321
02:29:11,970 --> 02:29:13,510
Are you a local by any chance?

3322
02:29:14,090 --> 02:29:14,570
No.

3323
02:29:14,610 --> 02:29:15,970
I've only recently arrived.

3324
02:29:16,390 --> 02:29:17,430
That's not possible.

3325
02:29:17,970 --> 02:29:19,910
And, uh, this line here.

3326
02:29:20,730 --> 02:29:23,110
You've had some very bad experiences here.

3327
02:29:23,350 --> 02:29:23,510
Oh.

3328
02:29:23,970 --> 02:29:24,610
Let's see.

3329
02:29:25,310 --> 02:29:28,270
Have been in physical pain at this bathhouse in the past?

3330
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:31,330
Not that I remember.

3331
02:29:31,490 --> 02:29:31,970
I don't know.

3332
02:29:33,410 --> 02:29:34,650
You don't have to lie to me.

3333
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:35,950
And this line here.

3334
02:29:36,250 --> 02:29:37,450
You have strong feelings for me.

3335
02:29:37,450 --> 02:29:45,430
You have strong feelings of resentment and love towards someone close to you like you're...

3336
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:46,370
Let go of me!

3337
02:29:48,510 --> 02:29:49,430
My apologies.

3338
02:29:53,820 --> 02:29:54,500
Oh, okay.

3339
02:29:54,640 --> 02:29:55,880
I don't have to clean up after her.

3340
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,340
Because she was a freak.

3341
02:30:03,150 --> 02:30:04,770
Oh, everyone here is weird.

3342
02:30:06,090 --> 02:30:08,070
This is the freakiest village ever.

3343
02:30:10,410 --> 02:30:13,230
Not only do we have ghosts, but we just have to deal with...

3344
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:13,430
Oh.

3345
02:30:13,450 --> 02:30:14,570
All sorts of weirdos.

3346
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:17,970
You're not gonna...

3347
02:30:17,970 --> 02:30:18,010
Oh.

3348
02:30:18,730 --> 02:30:20,150
We have to shower first.

3349
02:30:21,870 --> 02:30:22,310
Good.

3350
02:30:22,570 --> 02:30:23,010
Okay.

3351
02:30:23,050 --> 02:30:24,330
He's being normal for now.

3352
02:30:26,550 --> 02:30:27,970
He's normal for now.

3353
02:30:29,450 --> 02:30:29,890
Oh.

3354
02:30:30,250 --> 02:30:30,690
Oh.

3355
02:30:30,750 --> 02:30:31,010
He's back.

3356
02:30:33,930 --> 02:30:34,370
Oh!

3357
02:30:34,810 --> 02:30:36,390
It won't let me talk to him.

3358
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:41,030
The way he looks at me when he is like, stop.

3359
02:30:41,690 --> 02:30:43,110
Take care of your own stuff.

3360
02:30:43,150 --> 02:30:43,430
Oh!

3361
02:30:43,430 --> 02:30:44,250
He's like, stop looking at me!

3362
02:30:47,330 --> 02:30:47,950
Oh my god.

3363
02:30:48,450 --> 02:30:48,850
Okay.

3364
02:30:49,510 --> 02:30:50,670
The cameras are fine.

3365
02:30:56,390 --> 02:30:58,450
I think this guy is gonna get killed, maybe.

3366
02:31:00,470 --> 02:31:01,950
Are you gonna slow walk again?

3367
02:31:02,170 --> 02:31:02,670
Oh my god.

3368
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:03,490
He's doing it.

3369
02:31:03,770 --> 02:31:05,050
He's JoJo walking.

3370
02:31:07,010 --> 02:31:07,410
He's...

3371
02:31:07,410 --> 02:31:08,910
He's powering up, you guys.

3372
02:31:09,710 --> 02:31:10,330
Oh no!

3373
02:31:15,580 --> 02:31:15,980
Go.

3374
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:16,160
Go.

3375
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:16,360
Go.

3376
02:31:16,400 --> 02:31:16,580
Go.

3377
02:31:16,800 --> 02:31:16,820
Go.

3378
02:31:16,900 --> 02:31:17,020
Go.

3379
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:17,220
Go.

3380
02:31:17,280 --> 02:31:17,400
Go.

3381
02:31:17,460 --> 02:31:17,540
Go.

3382
02:31:17,540 --> 02:31:17,600
Go.

3383
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:17,800
Go.

3384
02:31:17,800 --> 02:31:18,020
Go.

3385
02:31:18,020 --> 02:31:18,400
Go.

3386
02:31:18,400 --> 02:31:18,420
Go.

3387
02:31:18,540 --> 02:31:18,860
Oh my god.

3388
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:21,320
What the hell?

3389
02:31:21,500 --> 02:31:21,900
Oh.

3390
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:25,340
Why are you walking like this?

3391
02:31:28,200 --> 02:31:28,600
Oh.

3392
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:30,440
I have to wipe up after this guy.

3393
02:31:30,660 --> 02:31:31,060
Okay.

3394
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:32,000
It was fine, I guess.

3395
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:36,600
Only a little bit of a freak.

3396
02:31:38,540 --> 02:31:41,000
On the freak meter, like a six.

3397
02:31:44,140 --> 02:31:45,420
I think I got all of it.

3398
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:46,320
Oh!

3399
02:31:46,320 --> 02:31:46,740
My god.

3400
02:31:47,160 --> 02:31:47,780
Oh my god.

3401
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:47,840
Oh my god.

3402
02:31:48,220 --> 02:31:48,500
Oh my god.

3403
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:48,520
Oh my god.

3404
02:31:49,580 --> 02:31:50,640
My name is Toru.

3405
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:52,100
I'm searching for my twin sister.

3406
02:31:52,800 --> 02:31:54,720
Do you know anything?

3407
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:55,600
Can you look at me?

3408
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:57,320
Why is he...

3409
02:31:57,320 --> 02:32:00,220
Why is he acting like such an anime protag right now?

3410
02:32:01,820 --> 02:32:02,980
Can you tell me about her?

3411
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:05,660
The thing is, I'm not sure.

3412
02:32:05,720 --> 02:32:06,440
What do you mean by that?

3413
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:07,640
It's your twin sister.

3414
02:32:10,100 --> 02:32:11,560
I know that she's in this village.

3415
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,060
Are you perhaps on the poster?

3416
02:32:15,860 --> 02:32:16,700
Maybe I was...

3417
02:32:16,700 --> 02:32:17,740
I feel like I've seen you before.

3418
02:32:17,740 --> 02:32:20,060
Maybe it's that poster with the name tag.

3419
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:23,720
Oh, I didn't say...

3420
02:32:23,720 --> 02:32:24,120
You...

3421
02:32:24,720 --> 02:32:26,880
I didn't say...

3422
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,420
You brought it up.

3423
02:32:29,380 --> 02:32:30,780
Was it the wanted poster?

3424
02:32:31,340 --> 02:32:32,560
I didn't do anything.

3425
02:32:32,820 --> 02:32:33,940
I didn't do anything.

3426
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:34,960
Believe me.

3427
02:32:35,200 --> 02:32:36,080
Please believe me.

3428
02:32:36,360 --> 02:32:39,060
It seems like there are people in this village who don't really think about me.

3429
02:32:40,540 --> 02:32:43,060
There's someone in this village who doesn't think highly of me.

3430
02:32:43,420 --> 02:32:45,160
Someone put up that strange poster.

3431
02:32:45,560 --> 02:32:46,900
Someone put up that strange poster.

3432
02:32:52,840 --> 02:32:53,240
Anyway...

3433
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:55,480
That's why I didn't do anything bad.

3434
02:32:55,620 --> 02:32:56,440
It must be a misunderstanding.

3435
02:32:59,460 --> 02:33:01,640
If you know anything about my sister, please let me know.

3436
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:07,050
Slow walks out of here.

3437
02:33:07,410 --> 02:33:11,630
You know, if you walked faster, you'd look less suspicious, I'm just saying.

3438
02:33:14,950 --> 02:33:17,410
The walking is not doing you any favors.

3439
02:33:29,390 --> 02:33:29,990
Okay.

3440
02:33:29,990 --> 02:33:30,590
Oh!

3441
02:33:31,630 --> 02:33:32,550
Hello friend!

3442
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:34,010
Is this the friend?

3443
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:36,630
Towel!

3444
02:33:36,650 --> 02:33:37,170
Okay.

3445
02:33:37,470 --> 02:33:39,070
This must be the friend, maybe.

3446
02:33:40,590 --> 02:33:42,010
There you are!

3447
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:48,780
Thanks for the raid!

3448
02:33:50,120 --> 02:33:51,100
Hello everybody!

3449
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:52,980
We're playing Chilla's Art Game.

3450
02:33:53,480 --> 02:33:55,780
It's an old game, but it was...

3451
02:33:55,780 --> 02:33:58,840
Apparently the old game had a bug, like a game-breaking bug.

3452
02:33:59,000 --> 02:34:02,160
So they took it off of Steam and then just remade the whole game.

3453
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:03,840
And now it's a new game.

3454
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:05,880
Hello!

3455
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:06,360
Buffy!

3456
02:34:06,480 --> 02:34:07,380
Thanks for the tech gift card!

3457
02:34:08,460 --> 02:34:10,020
I've been looking for you.

3458
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:11,920
You really haven't changed.

3459
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:14,640
Let me...

3460
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:20,560
I didn't even see any... Hello?

3461
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:25,680
Apparently thanks for the markup, dude!

3462
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:28,320
That was kind of freaky.

3463
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:34,240
The girl, like, popping up at places is a really good touch, I think.

3464
02:34:34,920 --> 02:34:35,780
What's up, grandma?

3465
02:34:37,820 --> 02:34:38,860
There's no milk.

3466
02:34:38,900 --> 02:34:39,540
Yes, there is.

3467
02:34:39,540 --> 02:34:40,180
It's right... Oh.

3468
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:42,340
Wait, you're right.

3469
02:34:44,340 --> 02:34:44,860
Uh...

3470
02:34:45,560 --> 02:34:48,560
Oh, sorry.

3471
02:34:48,660 --> 02:34:49,460
One moment, please.

3472
02:34:49,460 --> 02:34:51,300
I must fetch a guiño for grandma.

3473
02:34:51,580 --> 02:34:52,840
Wait, where's all the milk?

3474
02:34:54,020 --> 02:34:55,480
Who's drinking all the milk?

3475
02:34:55,880 --> 02:34:56,400
Alvin!

3476
02:34:56,540 --> 02:34:57,760
Thanks for the vibe gift card.

3477
02:34:58,560 --> 02:34:59,080
Guiño?

3478
02:35:00,940 --> 02:35:01,460
Guiño.

3479
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:03,600
Where do I... There's no milk.

3480
02:35:03,700 --> 02:35:04,820
Where do I get more milk at?

3481
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:07,920
Um...

3482
02:35:09,120 --> 02:35:09,800
Hold on!

3483
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:14,060
Raffle team, thanks for the vibe gift card!

3484
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:19,320
Hello, sir.

3485
02:35:20,280 --> 02:35:20,760
Shampoo.

3486
02:35:21,080 --> 02:35:21,560
Okay.

3487
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:27,620
What is a kid like you doing here?

3488
02:35:27,740 --> 02:35:28,220
Working?

3489
02:35:28,660 --> 02:35:32,740
Can a young lady who seems like she's never been out in society really do this?

3490
02:35:33,320 --> 02:35:35,340
Everyone is so judgmental to me!

3491
02:35:36,640 --> 02:35:38,680
I'll be struggling even more!

3492
02:35:47,340 --> 02:35:49,420
I'm gonna start saying that to people.

3493
02:35:53,100 --> 02:35:53,900
Oh my gosh!

3494
02:35:54,320 --> 02:35:55,040
I hope you had fun.

3495
02:35:55,460 --> 02:35:57,620
Chase, thank you so much for the gift card.

3496
02:35:58,480 --> 02:36:02,820
Instead of like saying goodbye to people, I'm gonna be like, I hope you struggle even more.

3497
02:36:06,480 --> 02:36:07,400
What the hell?

3498
02:36:08,640 --> 02:36:10,220
Where do I get more milk at?

3499
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:12,580
Oh...

3500
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:13,600
Oh...

3501
02:36:15,820 --> 02:36:20,440
I didn't even have time to be scared.

3502
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:23,320
She appeared and then disappeared out of nowhere.

3503
02:36:25,780 --> 02:36:27,620
Oh my god, not the squatty toilets.

3504
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:29,180
Fine, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3505
02:36:31,780 --> 02:36:33,040
I hate those toilets.

3506
02:36:33,320 --> 02:36:35,940
Ma'am, I'm looking for the gyuunyo but I don't know where he is.

3507
02:36:40,960 --> 02:36:42,580
I don't know, I already got some.

3508
02:36:53,140 --> 02:36:53,660
Gyuunyo?

3509
02:36:53,660 --> 02:36:54,640
In the back?

3510
02:36:54,700 --> 02:36:55,300
You think so?

3511
02:36:56,680 --> 02:36:57,660
Please say no.

3512
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:58,640
Please say, psych.

3513
02:37:02,680 --> 02:37:03,200
Okay.

3514
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:04,180
Oh my god!

3515
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:07,400
You are not human!

3516
02:37:09,060 --> 02:37:11,300
One moment, please.

3517
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:15,900
I have to make sure he's not being weirdo.

3518
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:17,420
Okay, he's dead, I think?

3519
02:37:21,650 --> 02:37:22,070
Well...

3520
02:37:24,730 --> 02:37:26,450
I just felt like dying.

3521
02:37:26,910 --> 02:37:28,250
Dying is the only way.

3522
02:37:29,370 --> 02:37:30,730
Sir, you need to leave.

3523
02:37:31,350 --> 02:37:33,150
Wait, he's got that freaky face on!

3524
02:37:35,730 --> 02:37:36,950
Get out of here.

3525
02:37:37,330 --> 02:37:38,670
Are you gonna make a mess in here?

3526
02:37:38,970 --> 02:37:40,210
Do I have to clean up after you?

3527
02:37:41,010 --> 02:37:41,630
No, okay.

3528
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:44,170
I don't have to clean up after the possessed people.

3529
02:37:44,390 --> 02:37:44,670
Well done!

3530
02:37:47,270 --> 02:37:49,170
I hope you struggle even more.

3531
02:37:51,650 --> 02:37:51,990
Okay.

3532
02:37:52,150 --> 02:37:53,810
Oh, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared!

3533
02:37:53,990 --> 02:37:57,530
I don't like being in here at all.

3534
02:37:59,490 --> 02:37:59,910
Gyuunyo?

3535
02:37:59,910 --> 02:38:00,330
Gyuunyo.

3536
02:38:01,390 --> 02:38:02,470
Milk, milk, milk.

3537
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:04,930
There's not even a fridge in here, so...

3538
02:38:04,930 --> 02:38:06,730
I feel like there's no gyuunyo.

3539
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:11,820
Relatable.

3540
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:15,760
Okay, I checked.

3541
02:38:17,700 --> 02:38:18,460
I was brave.

3542
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:20,540
Alien!

3543
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:21,560
Welcome to Manbusha Park!

3544
02:38:33,060 --> 02:38:35,120
Shaver, shampoo, wet wipes, towel.

3545
02:38:36,120 --> 02:38:36,760
Shaver?

3546
02:38:43,660 --> 02:38:44,300
Shampoo?

3547
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:50,560
The ghost is T-posing at me!

3548
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:51,820
Wet wipes.

3549
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:52,360
What else?

3550
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:54,980
Shaver, shampoo, wet towel.

3551
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:00,240
Sadness.

3552
02:39:02,020 --> 02:39:02,660
Sorrow.

3553
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:04,860
Rage.

3554
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:10,240
Only one of these is a Metal Gear character.

3555
02:39:10,580 --> 02:39:12,020
Can you guess which one?

3556
02:39:12,900 --> 02:39:13,380
Despair.

3557
02:39:13,440 --> 02:39:15,620
Oh, in the depth of... bathhouse.

3558
02:39:18,060 --> 02:39:19,360
Is she already possessed?

3559
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:21,260
Oh, my goodness, lady.

3560
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:24,040
I think she's already possessed.

3561
02:39:31,070 --> 02:39:32,950
Oh, god, sorry, I forgot about you.

3562
02:39:34,450 --> 02:39:36,990
I don't know where your gyuunyo is!

3563
02:39:38,450 --> 02:39:39,910
Are you gonna be a freak in there?

3564
02:39:40,870 --> 02:39:42,590
What are you smuggling in here?

3565
02:39:43,030 --> 02:39:44,210
That's not a baby!

3566
02:39:44,490 --> 02:39:44,930
Is it?

3567
02:39:46,710 --> 02:39:47,150
Oh.

3568
02:39:47,150 --> 02:39:47,710
It's nothing.

3569
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:48,330
Sorry.

3570
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:51,050
Be on your freaky way, ma'am.

3571
02:39:53,550 --> 02:39:54,710
I don't think that's a...

3572
02:39:54,710 --> 02:39:56,810
What are you smuggling in here?

3573
02:39:59,390 --> 02:40:02,750
You must find your emotions to take with you into the bathhouse.

3574
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:07,290
T-posing is totally normal.

3575
02:40:07,310 --> 02:40:07,830
So true.

3576
02:40:13,240 --> 02:40:14,980
Yeah, do you have the milk?

3577
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:17,140
Did you take all the milk?

3578
02:40:18,040 --> 02:40:20,400
This area is looking mighty bad.

3579
02:40:23,320 --> 02:40:26,600
Is that the freaky face or does she always look like that?

3580
02:40:27,200 --> 02:40:29,220
Uh-oh, I think she became possessed again.

3581
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:32,420
I think she's possessed, but like...

3582
02:40:33,780 --> 02:40:35,460
We'll just let her be for a minute.

3583
02:40:37,420 --> 02:40:37,900
Oh.

3584
02:40:43,550 --> 02:40:45,850
I turned away for two seconds!

3585
02:40:54,580 --> 02:40:56,120
Do I have to clean that up?

3586
02:40:58,340 --> 02:40:59,580
Ew, she's looking at me.

3587
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:02,560
Ma'am, you need to leave!

3588
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:06,600
There's no giving birth in the bathhouse!

3589
02:41:06,780 --> 02:41:08,580
I have to write a new rule, you guys.

3590
02:41:09,340 --> 02:41:10,620
It's all his fault.

3591
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:12,620
Why the hell did he do this?

3592
02:41:13,080 --> 02:41:14,840
That was close.

3593
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:16,980
I was almost pulled by her.

3594
02:41:17,760 --> 02:41:18,480
That was close.

3595
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:18,480
I was almost pulled by her.

3596
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:19,160
I have to clean this up!

3597
02:41:19,360 --> 02:41:21,180
This is a biohazard!

3598
02:41:21,480 --> 02:41:21,520
This is a biohazard!

3599
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:23,200
I... Oh my gosh!

3600
02:41:23,260 --> 02:41:24,000
She's just leaving!

3601
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:26,300
Ma'am, go to the hospital!

3602
02:41:31,410 --> 02:41:33,190
Your baby looks like bacon!

3603
02:41:33,370 --> 02:41:33,650
Please!

3604
02:41:34,310 --> 02:41:35,590
Go to the hospital!

3605
02:41:36,090 --> 02:41:37,050
Go to the hospital!

3606
02:41:37,050 --> 02:41:37,850
Oh my God.

3607
02:41:39,390 --> 02:41:39,950
Okay.

3608
02:41:41,390 --> 02:41:42,790
If you're happy...

3609
02:41:45,690 --> 02:41:46,250
Gyunyo...

3610
02:41:46,250 --> 02:41:46,530
Gyunyo...

3611
02:41:47,330 --> 02:41:49,150
This lady is still on about the Gyunyo.

3612
02:41:49,990 --> 02:41:50,550
Gyunyo...

3613
02:41:55,850 --> 02:41:56,450
I

3614
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:06,220
didn't finish this lady!

3615
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,840
There's an NPC that's supposed to sell you milk.

3616
02:42:11,920 --> 02:42:14,620
Don't know how to get her to appear though.

3617
02:42:14,800 --> 02:42:18,380
Oh my gosh!

3618
02:42:19,240 --> 02:42:20,480
Janitor of the month.

3619
02:42:20,500 --> 02:42:22,360
Mop the floor perfectly every day.

3620
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,240
Good work.

3621
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:27,740
I did a great job!

3622
02:42:36,100 --> 02:42:38,020
Can you clean the mirrors today?

3623
02:42:41,500 --> 02:42:43,860
Wash the dirty mirrors with the shower then...

3624
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:47,460
Wipe them clean with the cleaning cloth.

3625
02:42:49,980 --> 02:42:52,020
Please work hard until the end of today as well.

3626
02:42:52,520 --> 02:42:53,700
Can you stay here?

3627
02:42:54,160 --> 02:42:55,740
Wait, what about this lady though?

3628
02:42:56,140 --> 02:42:57,000
Oh, she's gone.

3629
02:42:59,320 --> 02:42:59,740
Okay.

3630
02:43:02,880 --> 02:43:04,680
Do I get the cleaning cloth from here?

3631
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:13,180
What is this anyway?

3632
02:43:13,260 --> 02:43:13,880
Just a table?

3633
02:43:15,980 --> 02:43:16,400
Okay.

3634
02:43:21,620 --> 02:43:22,860
Sorry, I thought I heard something.

3635
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:27,720
After a lady gives birth in your place of business, that seems like an appropriate time to just shut down and go home.

3636
02:43:29,180 --> 02:43:31,780
This cleaning cloth looks nasty even.

3637
02:43:35,440 --> 02:43:36,040
It's getting lonely.

3638
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:36,280
Oh, oh.

3639
02:43:37,740 --> 02:43:39,780
Is something going to show up in the mirror?

3640
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:40,540
Hello?

3641
02:43:41,740 --> 02:43:42,760
Oh my goodness.

3642
02:43:43,280 --> 02:43:44,520
It's so specific.

3643
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:55,520
Every little tiny corner!

3644
02:43:57,220 --> 02:43:58,480
Oh, I'm scared.

3645
02:43:58,800 --> 02:43:59,280
I'm scared!

3646
02:43:59,680 --> 02:44:03,660
No, I didn't clean up after- That's above my pay grade, okay.

3647
02:44:07,440 --> 02:44:12,960
Actually, part of the reason I couldn't work at a... I worked at a fast food place, right?

3648
02:44:13,740 --> 02:44:17,680
But because I couldn't clean the stuff well enough...

3649
02:44:17,680 --> 02:44:21,060
I was like, nothing... as much as I clean, nothing just...

3650
02:44:21,060 --> 02:44:23,080
Nothing becomes clean!

3651
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:25,640
I felt like I had to quit.

3652
02:44:25,820 --> 02:44:26,800
I was like, this is...

3653
02:44:26,800 --> 02:44:28,980
I mean, there was obviously other reasons, but...

3654
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:32,600
I was like, I just can't clean it well enough.

3655
02:44:34,600 --> 02:44:35,240
Oh!

3656
02:44:35,240 --> 02:44:36,400
It's still there!

3657
02:44:39,400 --> 02:44:40,860
Pink, welcome to Banbosha!

3658
02:44:40,940 --> 02:44:41,640
Thank you!

3659
02:44:46,780 --> 02:44:50,420
Because you have to clean everything so fast, it's like... not...

3660
02:44:50,420 --> 02:44:51,940
It doesn't feel...

3661
02:44:52,480 --> 02:44:52,940
What the?

3662
02:44:53,060 --> 02:44:54,340
What's going on in there?

3663
02:44:56,640 --> 02:44:57,920
This place...

3664
02:44:59,580 --> 02:45:02,100
Do I need to mop that up first?

3665
02:45:02,880 --> 02:45:03,720
Happy birthday, Mito!

3666
02:45:04,340 --> 02:45:05,660
My birthday is also on the 1st.

3667
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:07,000
I'm happy to split cakes with what I'm washing.

3668
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:08,340
Patman, thank you!

3669
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:10,160
Oh my gosh, wait, that reminds me.

3670
02:45:10,180 --> 02:45:10,540
I got cake.

3671
02:45:12,960 --> 02:45:14,680
I don't think I can clean that up.

3672
02:45:14,740 --> 02:45:15,880
I don't have a broom.

3673
02:45:19,980 --> 02:45:21,340
Will the mop work, I wonder?

3674
02:45:26,040 --> 02:45:28,320
I can't... let me... maybe if I put it away?

3675
02:45:28,920 --> 02:45:29,260
Okay.

3676
02:45:29,840 --> 02:45:30,920
Let's see if I can use the mop.

3677
02:45:33,540 --> 02:45:33,940
Oh.

3678
02:45:34,380 --> 02:45:34,780
Nope.

3679
02:45:35,940 --> 02:45:37,240
It won't let me clean it up.

3680
02:45:43,930 --> 02:45:44,330
Okay.

3681
02:45:48,550 --> 02:45:49,570
I'm finally done.

3682
02:45:49,710 --> 02:45:50,530
I'll take a shower.

3683
02:45:50,730 --> 02:45:51,710
Is that a good idea?

3684
02:45:52,810 --> 02:45:54,130
Is that a good idea?

3685
02:45:56,050 --> 02:45:57,450
Do I use my hands?

3686
02:45:57,510 --> 02:45:58,090
Let's try it.

3687
02:45:59,830 --> 02:46:01,770
Oh my gosh, okay.

3688
02:46:03,430 --> 02:46:04,710
Wait, why is... uh oh.

3689
02:46:04,830 --> 02:46:06,030
There's still a progress bar.

3690
02:46:06,030 --> 02:46:08,130
I think I bugged it.

3691
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:11,790
You guys, I bugged it a little bit.

3692
02:46:11,810 --> 02:46:12,170
My bad.

3693
02:46:15,010 --> 02:46:16,510
Oh no, it's just staying there.

3694
02:46:23,740 --> 02:46:24,140
What?

3695
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:26,260
What was that?

3696
02:46:26,780 --> 02:46:27,440
I'm scared.

3697
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:28,180
I don't want to look.

3698
02:46:30,800 --> 02:46:32,980
I don't really want to take a bath because of yesterday.

3699
02:46:33,340 --> 02:46:34,980
Maybe I'll go into the sauna instead.

3700
02:46:35,620 --> 02:46:36,020
No!

3701
02:46:37,640 --> 02:46:38,040
No!

3702
02:46:39,160 --> 02:46:39,560
No!

3703
02:46:39,560 --> 02:46:39,640
No!

3704
02:46:53,580 --> 02:46:55,220
I'm so stupid.

3705
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:58,280
Let me just sit in the really dark room.

3706
02:46:59,080 --> 02:46:59,820
That's scary.

3707
02:47:00,640 --> 02:47:02,780
I think I'll try to stay as long as possible.

3708
02:47:03,100 --> 02:47:03,760
What do you mean?

3709
02:47:08,830 --> 02:47:09,770
What is that?

3710
02:47:09,890 --> 02:47:10,210
What?

3711
02:47:11,010 --> 02:47:11,830
Wait, I'm confused.

3712
02:47:12,710 --> 02:47:13,130
Huh?

3713
02:47:15,090 --> 02:47:16,030
I'm at my limit.

3714
02:47:16,090 --> 02:47:17,270
I need to get into the bath.

3715
02:47:17,530 --> 02:47:18,010
Oh, what?

3716
02:47:20,570 --> 02:47:20,990
What?

3717
02:47:23,490 --> 02:47:24,230
I'm confused.

3718
02:47:25,810 --> 02:47:26,290
Okay.

3719
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:31,820
I'm so stupid.

3720
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:32,020
Why?

3721
02:47:32,100 --> 02:47:34,000
I just said that I didn't want to be in the bath.

3722
02:47:35,140 --> 02:47:36,420
Okay, one more time.

3723
02:47:38,100 --> 02:47:38,580
What?

3724
02:47:41,980 --> 02:47:43,000
Oh, okay.

3725
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:49,320
This is strange.

3726
02:47:56,550 --> 02:47:58,730
Am I just clicking it?

3727
02:48:00,930 --> 02:48:01,330
Oh.

3728
02:48:01,450 --> 02:48:01,570
Oh.

3729
02:48:02,330 --> 02:48:02,730
Oh.

3730
02:48:06,010 --> 02:48:06,410
Okay.

3731
02:48:07,650 --> 02:48:08,850
I don't like this.

3732
02:48:13,250 --> 02:48:14,590
What is it making me do?

3733
02:48:14,730 --> 02:48:15,790
Oh, get back in the bath again?

3734
02:48:17,010 --> 02:48:17,410
Okay.

3735
02:48:18,530 --> 02:48:18,930
What?

3736
02:48:21,650 --> 02:48:22,050
Okay.

3737
02:48:22,150 --> 02:48:23,130
It's really quiet.

3738
02:48:23,270 --> 02:48:25,090
So it's making me like freaked out.

3739
02:48:27,830 --> 02:48:28,230
Okay.

3740
02:48:29,650 --> 02:48:30,270
One more time.

3741
02:48:30,270 --> 02:48:30,550
One more time.

3742
02:48:31,190 --> 02:48:31,670
Okay.

3743
02:48:35,050 --> 02:48:35,530
Again?

3744
02:48:38,970 --> 02:48:39,450
Again?

3745
02:48:41,790 --> 02:48:43,770
QTEs are why I don't go to the sauna.

3746
02:48:43,850 --> 02:48:44,330
So true.

3747
02:48:48,830 --> 02:48:49,310
Okay.

3748
02:48:49,670 --> 02:48:51,430
I knew this is going to happen.

3749
02:48:51,670 --> 02:48:53,150
I can't see, ma'am.

3750
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:56,730
I can't see the QTEs.

3751
02:48:58,490 --> 02:48:58,970
Oh.

3752
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:01,210
Oh.

3753
02:49:02,060 --> 02:49:02,490
That's me.

3754
02:49:04,890 --> 02:49:05,470
Oh.

3755
02:49:05,770 --> 02:49:06,350
Grandma.

3756
02:49:09,270 --> 02:49:10,190
What the hell?

3757
02:49:10,370 --> 02:49:10,950
Grandma.

3758
02:49:11,270 --> 02:49:12,730
What is happening?

3759
02:49:14,960 --> 02:49:15,830
Who's behind you?

3760
02:49:16,930 --> 02:49:17,510
Milk.

3761
02:49:18,850 --> 02:49:20,310
Do you have milk?

3762
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:21,910
My milk.

3763
02:49:22,830 --> 02:49:24,370
What is that behind you?

3764
02:49:24,610 --> 02:49:27,270
It's like clipping through the... Oh, it's the fan.

3765
02:49:27,390 --> 02:49:27,710
Just kidding.

3766
02:49:29,090 --> 02:49:29,670
QTEs.

3767
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:29,730
QTEs.

3768
02:49:29,730 --> 02:49:29,910
Okay.

3769
02:49:29,930 --> 02:49:31,870
There's milk at my supermarket.

3770
02:49:32,330 --> 02:49:33,210
Hey, you.

3771
02:49:33,310 --> 02:49:34,810
Come pick the milk up.

3772
02:49:35,450 --> 02:49:36,090
Okay.

3773
02:49:39,230 --> 02:49:39,870
Oh.

3774
02:49:40,090 --> 02:49:41,230
We're at the supermarket.

3775
02:49:47,260 --> 02:49:49,460
You have nothing here except fans.

3776
02:49:50,140 --> 02:49:51,340
A shooting range?

3777
02:49:55,130 --> 02:49:56,670
This looks fun.

3778
02:49:56,970 --> 02:49:57,910
Start the game.

3779
02:49:59,410 --> 02:50:00,750
Aim down sight.

3780
02:50:00,890 --> 02:50:01,070
Oh.

3781
02:50:02,050 --> 02:50:02,970
Oh my gosh.

3782
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:06,010
Oh, don't shoot the people.

3783
02:50:06,210 --> 02:50:06,970
Who am I shooting?

3784
02:50:07,190 --> 02:50:07,970
Oh, you have a knife.

3785
02:50:09,510 --> 02:50:10,970
Maybe don't shoot the little kid.

3786
02:50:13,250 --> 02:50:14,510
Or do they have a knife?

3787
02:50:14,730 --> 02:50:15,870
It kind of looked like they had a knife.

3788
02:50:17,030 --> 02:50:17,870
Oh my gosh.

3789
02:50:17,970 --> 02:50:18,230
Okay.

3790
02:50:18,270 --> 02:50:19,290
I keep holding it down.

3791
02:50:19,530 --> 02:50:19,730
Oops.

3792
02:50:19,850 --> 02:50:20,210
My bad.

3793
02:50:28,520 --> 02:50:30,560
Oh, don't shoot the kid unless they have a knife?

3794
02:50:32,600 --> 02:50:33,700
It kind of looks like a knife.

3795
02:50:35,480 --> 02:50:36,560
What am I supposed to kill?

3796
02:50:39,080 --> 02:50:42,560
What am I supposed to kill?

3797
02:50:42,780 --> 02:50:43,440
Oh my God.

3798
02:50:43,780 --> 02:50:45,020
Oh, they definitely have knives.

3799
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:47,960
I'm

3800
02:50:52,690 --> 02:50:53,370
supposed to kill everything.

3801
02:50:54,190 --> 02:50:54,810
Oh my God.

3802
02:50:54,850 --> 02:50:55,270
They're going up.

3803
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:02,060
Am I supposed to kill you?

3804
02:51:02,260 --> 02:51:03,160
Who has a knife?

3805
02:51:04,740 --> 02:51:05,420
What's happening?

3806
02:51:06,480 --> 02:51:07,360
Oh, sorry, kid.

3807
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:09,060
Get out of the way.

3808
02:51:11,620 --> 02:51:11,980
Shit.

3809
02:51:11,980 --> 02:51:12,060
That's it.

3810
02:51:42,910 --> 02:51:45,010
If it exists, mint shoots.

3811
02:51:46,050 --> 02:51:48,510
Kill everything but the chinchilla.

3812
02:51:53,010 --> 02:51:54,950
I killed ten chinchillas.

3813
02:52:00,990 --> 02:52:02,110
What's game B?

3814
02:52:04,940 --> 02:52:05,790
Show patrons.

3815
02:52:06,900 --> 02:52:07,670
Game is playing.

3816
02:52:07,730 --> 02:52:07,910
What?

3817
02:52:09,870 --> 02:52:10,350
Oh.

3818
02:52:11,430 --> 02:52:11,910
Wait.

3819
02:52:12,070 --> 02:52:12,910
This is so cute.

3820
02:52:14,650 --> 02:52:15,590
Oh my God.

3821
02:52:17,310 --> 02:52:18,330
Can I shoot them?

3822
02:52:21,750 --> 02:52:22,910
Oh, this is fun.

3823
02:52:23,330 --> 02:52:23,810
Wow.

3824
02:52:26,030 --> 02:52:27,390
It's so bright in here.

3825
02:52:42,220 --> 02:52:42,700
Okay.

3826
02:52:42,700 --> 02:52:45,020
Now we have to see if we can shoot the patrons.

3827
02:52:47,820 --> 02:52:49,500
Why is she so small?

3828
02:52:52,760 --> 02:52:53,280
Okay.

3829
02:52:53,480 --> 02:52:53,940
Let's see.

3830
02:53:03,460 --> 02:53:05,240
So I shoot everything...

3831
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:06,060
Oh, sorry, chinchilla.

3832
02:53:07,040 --> 02:53:08,560
Everything but the chinchillas.

3833
02:53:49,040 --> 02:53:50,260
Oh, this is where we...

3834
02:53:51,200 --> 02:53:52,060
Money, baby.

3835
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:52,740
Money, baby.

3836
02:54:00,390 --> 02:54:01,970
I want to shoot the patrons.

3837
02:54:04,050 --> 02:54:05,670
Oh, I admit I got two.

3838
02:54:05,790 --> 02:54:06,050
Oh.

3839
02:54:08,610 --> 02:54:09,250
This is so cute.

3840
02:54:09,250 --> 02:54:09,670
I got two.

3841
02:54:11,930 --> 02:54:12,570
Wait.

3842
02:54:12,730 --> 02:54:13,770
Is this the patrons?

3843
02:54:19,260 --> 02:54:20,200
Where is she?

3844
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:22,040
Wait, was that...

3845
02:54:22,040 --> 02:54:22,660
Sorry.

3846
02:54:25,320 --> 02:54:26,840
Say goodbye, Doki bird.

3847
02:54:33,200 --> 02:54:34,060
Good game.

3848
02:54:34,600 --> 02:54:36,180
You can shoot Doki.

3849
02:54:38,460 --> 02:54:40,380
I don't need to do anything else.

3850
02:54:41,300 --> 02:54:41,940
Good game.

3851
02:54:53,740 --> 02:54:54,740
Ah, Fuji's side!

3852
02:54:54,820 --> 02:54:55,200
I'm sorry!

3853
02:54:55,900 --> 02:54:56,300
Oh,

3854
02:55:02,660 --> 02:55:02,860
shoot.

3855
02:55:02,940 --> 02:55:03,420
That was close.

3856
02:55:06,280 --> 02:55:07,140
Sorry, old man.

3857
02:55:07,380 --> 02:55:09,140
Oh, damn.

3858
02:55:09,340 --> 02:55:10,000
I missed it.

3859
02:55:31,220 --> 02:55:33,400
Because these are like different shapes than before, you know?

3860
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:36,600
I can't even tell who some of these people are.

3861
02:55:36,640 --> 02:55:37,120
They're so bright.

3862
02:55:37,780 --> 02:55:40,440
Not that I would know, but I can't see what they look like.

3863
02:55:43,880 --> 02:55:45,360
Oh my god.

3864
02:55:45,440 --> 02:55:46,400
Sorry, random girl.

3865
02:55:46,520 --> 02:55:48,420
It's kind of morbid to shoot the real people.

3866
02:56:02,360 --> 02:56:02,840
Nice.

3867
02:56:03,180 --> 02:56:03,840
Well, that was fun.

3868
02:56:03,960 --> 02:56:06,400
That was a good little minigame to do.

3869
02:56:08,800 --> 02:56:09,560
Oh my god.

3870
02:56:09,660 --> 02:56:10,200
Oh, hello.

3871
02:56:10,780 --> 02:56:11,500
There's a cat!

3872
02:56:12,220 --> 02:56:12,700
Hmm.

3873
02:56:13,260 --> 02:56:14,160
Your face.

3874
02:56:15,100 --> 02:56:15,580
Eyes.

3875
02:56:15,640 --> 02:56:16,480
It's those eyes.

3876
02:56:17,460 --> 02:56:18,340
Your eyes.

3877
02:56:18,340 --> 02:56:19,780
Where have I...

3878
02:56:23,620 --> 02:56:24,060
Ah!

3879
02:56:24,060 --> 02:56:24,500
Milk!

3880
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:26,820
If you help with the store, I'll give it to you.

3881
02:56:27,020 --> 02:56:27,460
This.

3882
02:56:29,180 --> 02:56:31,040
The products in this cardboard box.

3883
02:56:31,380 --> 02:56:33,060
Line them up on the shelves.

3884
02:56:33,380 --> 02:56:34,780
That was some fancy shooting.

3885
02:56:34,920 --> 02:56:35,660
You're pretty good.

3886
02:56:36,860 --> 02:56:37,300
Thanks!

3887
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:44,480
Where do I... oh.

3888
02:56:46,560 --> 02:56:47,000
R?

3889
02:56:47,860 --> 02:56:48,300
Wait.

3890
02:56:49,820 --> 02:56:51,320
How do I rotate it?

3891
02:56:51,660 --> 02:56:52,980
R plus... oh, okay.

3892
02:56:53,120 --> 02:56:53,380
Here we go.

3893
02:56:54,500 --> 02:56:55,180
Like so?

3894
02:56:59,810 --> 02:57:02,210
Oh, my depth perception.

3895
02:57:06,170 --> 02:57:08,890
I just dropped everything on the ground.

3896
02:57:11,130 --> 02:57:13,130
Mmm, potato chips.

3897
02:57:16,150 --> 02:57:17,310
Oh, whoops.

3898
02:57:19,950 --> 02:57:21,790
Okay, this one's a little tricky.

3899
02:57:27,310 --> 02:57:27,750
Yes!

3900
02:57:31,270 --> 02:57:31,530
Okay.

3901
02:57:32,350 --> 02:57:32,830
Okay.

3902
02:57:33,370 --> 02:57:34,530
Can I pet the cat?

3903
02:57:35,810 --> 02:57:37,370
You can't pet the cat!

3904
02:57:37,510 --> 02:57:38,450
Chilla's art, please!

3905
02:57:40,090 --> 02:57:41,430
What kind of game is this?

3906
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:44,110
You can't pet the cat.

3907
02:57:45,790 --> 02:57:46,690
Oh, come on!

3908
02:57:46,730 --> 02:57:47,350
I had that!

3909
02:57:48,730 --> 02:57:49,230
Messed up.

3910
02:57:50,050 --> 02:57:50,670
There we go.

3911
02:57:52,970 --> 02:57:55,430
Look carefully at how the products on the shelves are displayed.

3912
02:57:57,330 --> 02:57:58,330
I did it though.

3913
02:57:59,730 --> 02:58:01,290
Oh, on the back too?

3914
02:58:01,910 --> 02:58:02,350
No?

3915
02:58:03,030 --> 02:58:04,010
What did I do wrong?

3916
02:58:04,190 --> 02:58:04,930
Oh, there's one more!

3917
02:58:05,190 --> 02:58:05,830
Oh, my bad.

3918
02:58:05,890 --> 02:58:06,250
I didn't see it.

3919
02:58:07,630 --> 02:58:09,970
I don't... short people don't look up, okay guys?

3920
02:58:10,370 --> 02:58:11,130
Also gamers.

3921
02:58:11,270 --> 02:58:12,250
Gamers don't look up.

3922
02:58:13,050 --> 02:58:13,690
There we go.

3923
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:16,590
Next is this.

3924
02:58:19,850 --> 02:58:22,630
All the delicious breakfasts.

3925
02:58:22,770 --> 02:58:23,210
Okay.

3926
02:58:24,870 --> 02:58:25,310
Uh...

3927
02:58:28,600 --> 02:58:29,380
Next gamer.

3928
02:58:29,560 --> 02:58:34,160
Actually, I really don't like looking up because, you know, it hurts my neck.

3929
02:58:34,340 --> 02:58:37,240
And so, I have... I have to be short.

3930
02:58:37,400 --> 02:58:41,800
So, tall people should just have to look down at me and like cater to me.

3931
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:47,120
Why do I give them the satisfaction of looking up?

3932
02:58:47,800 --> 02:58:48,380
You know?

3933
02:58:48,700 --> 02:58:50,000
That's how I feel about that.

3934
02:58:50,320 --> 02:58:50,920
There we go.

3935
02:58:54,480 --> 02:58:54,940
Uh...

3936
02:58:55,700 --> 02:58:56,580
Face down.

3937
02:59:03,740 --> 02:59:04,420
Like so.

3938
02:59:07,020 --> 02:59:07,480
Yes.

3939
02:59:08,300 --> 02:59:09,520
And then sideways.

3940
02:59:11,480 --> 02:59:13,780
Why are you... why are you like this, old lady?

3941
02:59:16,300 --> 02:59:16,760
Sideways.

3942
02:59:24,230 --> 02:59:25,290
Top one is wrong?

3943
02:59:25,410 --> 02:59:25,670
It is?

3944
02:59:25,890 --> 02:59:27,090
Hold on, I'll check it in a second.

3945
02:59:27,910 --> 02:59:28,550
There we go.

3946
02:59:30,950 --> 02:59:31,450
Oh, you're right.

3947
02:59:31,490 --> 02:59:31,790
Thank you.

3948
02:59:33,490 --> 02:59:34,270
There we go.

3949
02:59:36,710 --> 02:59:37,250
Next.

3950
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:39,770
Minto likes being looked down on.

3951
02:59:39,870 --> 02:59:40,310
Conversion.

3952
02:59:40,870 --> 02:59:43,730
How to talk to short people comic but with mint.

3953
02:59:45,070 --> 02:59:45,610
Poki.

3954
02:59:46,250 --> 02:59:47,130
I mean...

3955
02:59:50,070 --> 02:59:51,150
Distinguishly distinct...

3956
02:59:51,150 --> 02:59:51,850
Huh?

3957
02:59:52,450 --> 02:59:53,110
Wait, what?

3958
02:59:56,770 --> 02:59:57,310
What?

3959
02:59:58,650 --> 02:59:59,750
So, laying down?

3960
03:00:03,030 --> 03:00:03,790
Like that?

3961
03:00:04,230 --> 03:00:05,130
Like that?

3962
03:00:05,970 --> 03:00:08,010
Then upside down.

3963
03:00:09,930 --> 03:00:11,690
Yeah, legally distinct sticks.

3964
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:19,280
Upside down.

3965
03:00:20,180 --> 03:00:24,160
Then lying flat upside down?

3966
03:00:27,020 --> 03:00:28,660
Sorry to get hungry, you guys.

3967
03:00:30,440 --> 03:00:34,460
How much... for anyone who's seen this game, how much longer do I have?

3968
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:45,960
I'm halfway?

3969
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:47,540
No way.

3970
03:00:48,600 --> 03:00:51,260
Oh wait, this is also upside down, but straight.

3971
03:00:58,900 --> 03:00:59,880
Is that correct?

3972
03:01:01,440 --> 03:01:03,640
Wait, does this mean it's the only one right?

3973
03:01:04,040 --> 03:01:04,600
Huh?

3974
03:01:10,640 --> 03:01:11,800
Yellow if correct.

3975
03:01:12,980 --> 03:01:16,620
Maybe this needs to be facing the other direction.

3976
03:01:17,960 --> 03:01:18,420
No?

3977
03:01:21,020 --> 03:01:21,480
What?

3978
03:01:21,540 --> 03:01:23,260
But that's literally how it is.

3979
03:01:33,380 --> 03:01:35,120
Oh, it's the color too.

3980
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:39,120
Oh, it's got to be blue.

3981
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:41,300
I see, I see, I see.

3982
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:44,640
Because they are color coded.

3983
03:01:45,940 --> 03:01:46,640
Okay, okay.

3984
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:48,080
Come here.

3985
03:01:50,860 --> 03:01:52,880
Oh, I actually didn't see what color.

3986
03:01:52,960 --> 03:01:54,400
But this is the only one we haven't used.

3987
03:01:54,420 --> 03:01:54,840
So...

3988
03:01:59,120 --> 03:02:02,920
It's down like so.

3989
03:02:03,480 --> 03:02:06,800
If I'm elected president, I will make sure all citizens are the same perfect height.

3990
03:02:08,440 --> 03:02:09,980
There's nothing wrong with my height!

3991
03:02:14,020 --> 03:02:15,380
I might have to get a snack then.

3992
03:02:15,440 --> 03:02:17,240
Do you guys mind if I grab a snack real quick?

3993
03:02:20,060 --> 03:02:22,020
Actually, I might grab the cake.

3994
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:25,960
I don't think I... I don't have any leftovers.

3995
03:02:27,540 --> 03:02:30,000
Let's grab a... let's do a snack run real quick.

3996
03:02:33,700 --> 03:02:34,780
Next is the last.

3997
03:02:37,040 --> 03:02:37,900
Give me one second.

3998
03:02:38,140 --> 03:02:39,120
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

3999
03:02:39,560 --> 03:02:41,100
Well, oh, not pizza time.

4000
03:02:41,260 --> 03:02:41,500
Hold on.

4001
03:02:46,760 --> 03:02:48,020
I'm not even going to the bathroom.

4002
03:02:48,120 --> 03:02:48,840
Well, I might go to the bathroom.

4003
03:02:48,960 --> 03:02:49,240
I don't know.

4004
03:02:49,320 --> 03:02:50,020
I'm going to grab a snack.

4005
03:02:52,380 --> 03:02:54,420
And I suggest you guys maybe do the same.

4006
03:02:55,280 --> 03:02:56,560
Snack time, baby!

4007
03:05:17,840 --> 03:05:18,700
Oh my god.

4008
03:05:18,720 --> 03:05:20,480
I had some fruit in my fridge.

4009
03:05:22,060 --> 03:05:22,600
But...

4010
03:05:23,340 --> 03:05:25,800
I didn't finish before I left Japan.

4011
03:05:26,960 --> 03:05:28,640
So it's like not good now.

4012
03:05:31,080 --> 03:05:32,220
Which makes me sad.

4013
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:35,540
I forgot about it before I left.

4014
03:05:37,100 --> 03:05:40,420
But I went to get some stuff out of my fridge.

4015
03:05:40,660 --> 03:05:41,280
The cake.

4016
03:05:42,440 --> 03:05:43,700
And I heard something.

4017
03:05:43,700 --> 03:05:44,580
Something like...

4018
03:05:47,320 --> 03:05:48,900
And I was like, what is that?

4019
03:05:49,320 --> 03:05:52,160
And I think the fruit was about to explode.

4020
03:05:54,200 --> 03:05:54,600
I

4021
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:01,020
think it was about to explode.

4022
03:06:04,500 --> 03:06:06,900
I think, yeah, like the pressure was building up in there.

4023
03:06:11,400 --> 03:06:12,360
That's kind of crazy.

4024
03:06:12,700 --> 03:06:13,100
Okay.

4025
03:06:13,760 --> 03:06:14,740
Cake for my birthday.

4026
03:06:15,440 --> 03:06:16,960
Since I didn't have any yesterday.

4027
03:06:21,060 --> 03:06:25,060
Oh, I also got some cheese-o-kaki.

4028
03:06:28,200 --> 03:06:30,340
Sorry if you heard me crunching on it.

4029
03:06:34,490 --> 03:06:36,310
I got some cheese-o-kaki.

4030
03:06:37,010 --> 03:06:37,850
It's so good.

4031
03:06:37,910 --> 03:06:40,490
It's basically like a senbei with cheese in the middle.

4032
03:06:44,030 --> 03:06:45,510
Cheese-o-kaki, my beloved.

4033
03:06:45,510 --> 03:06:46,170
Yeah,

4034
03:06:51,540 --> 03:06:53,080
I grabbed some snacks before I left.

4035
03:06:53,160 --> 03:06:56,720
I usually just go to a convenience store and grab like a party's worth of snacks.

4036
03:06:56,860 --> 03:06:58,600
And then have them for like a month.

4037
03:07:07,710 --> 03:07:08,150
Okay.

4038
03:07:12,190 --> 03:07:12,630
Delicious.

4039
03:07:17,730 --> 03:07:18,830
Let's resume our game.

4040
03:07:19,030 --> 03:07:20,030
Oh, I didn't realize that.

4041
03:07:21,550 --> 03:07:22,690
There was no sound.

4042
03:07:22,770 --> 03:07:23,610
I'm so sorry, you guys.

4043
03:07:28,210 --> 03:07:30,170
Okay, so this is a Gumi.

4044
03:07:33,450 --> 03:07:34,750
How am I supposed to...

4045
03:07:34,750 --> 03:07:36,470
Okay, I think it goes with the Doritos.

4046
03:07:39,410 --> 03:07:40,570
Yeah, I knew it.

4047
03:07:43,150 --> 03:07:44,450
Now let's take... No, no, no.

4048
03:07:44,970 --> 03:07:45,890
Let's take the ra...

4049
03:07:45,890 --> 03:07:47,530
Oh, my bad.

4050
03:07:48,230 --> 03:07:49,550
Okay, let's take the ramen.

4051
03:07:50,490 --> 03:07:52,030
And we'll put it...

4052
03:07:53,610 --> 03:07:54,770
With the cylinders.

4053
03:07:56,230 --> 03:07:57,050
Upside down.

4054
03:07:58,790 --> 03:07:59,570
Just kidding.

4055
03:07:59,670 --> 03:08:00,210
That was incorrect.

4056
03:08:00,670 --> 03:08:02,210
Is there like actual drink in here?

4057
03:08:03,150 --> 03:08:04,670
No, we have some mag...

4058
03:08:04,670 --> 03:08:05,130
Oh, my God.

4059
03:08:05,190 --> 03:08:06,550
Wacky inflatable flailing tumen.

4060
03:08:06,650 --> 03:08:08,190
Oh, my gosh.

4061
03:08:08,210 --> 03:08:09,090
Cat magazine.

4062
03:08:11,670 --> 03:08:13,610
This must be stood on its spine.

4063
03:08:13,870 --> 03:08:15,290
What a horrible way to...

4064
03:08:17,730 --> 03:08:19,150
To present your books.

4065
03:08:19,570 --> 03:08:20,770
Wait, this way, maybe?

4066
03:08:21,370 --> 03:08:22,530
Did I put it the wrong way?

4067
03:08:22,670 --> 03:08:23,150
Oh, my gosh.

4068
03:08:23,170 --> 03:08:24,430
I can't rotate it well.

4069
03:08:25,270 --> 03:08:26,070
No, please.

4070
03:08:26,990 --> 03:08:27,990
Oh, my gosh.

4071
03:08:28,030 --> 03:08:28,310
Please.

4072
03:08:29,850 --> 03:08:30,650
Like that.

4073
03:08:31,670 --> 03:08:32,070
No.

4074
03:08:33,470 --> 03:08:34,110
This way.

4075
03:08:34,710 --> 03:08:35,650
Please, this way.

4076
03:08:36,790 --> 03:08:37,190
No.

4077
03:08:39,210 --> 03:08:39,770
This way.

4078
03:08:39,850 --> 03:08:40,230
There we go.

4079
03:08:40,430 --> 03:08:41,030
Yes, okay.

4080
03:08:41,630 --> 03:08:42,510
Alright, we got two.

4081
03:08:47,280 --> 03:08:47,680
Cookie.

4082
03:08:47,680 --> 03:08:50,340
I think that's right.

4083
03:08:50,440 --> 03:08:51,780
We just have to get it the right way.

4084
03:08:52,100 --> 03:08:53,320
So, this is...

4085
03:08:54,240 --> 03:08:55,020
Upside down?

4086
03:08:55,900 --> 03:08:57,540
Or like facing down, I think.

4087
03:08:59,460 --> 03:08:59,980
No.

4088
03:09:02,280 --> 03:09:02,800
No.

4089
03:09:04,580 --> 03:09:05,360
Oh, my God.

4090
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:06,760
No.

4091
03:09:08,520 --> 03:09:09,040
No.

4092
03:09:10,680 --> 03:09:11,200
Now.

4093
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:14,520
No.

4094
03:09:26,270 --> 03:09:26,790
Okay.

4095
03:09:26,970 --> 03:09:27,850
Alright, now you.

4096
03:09:29,350 --> 03:09:31,170
Oh, it has to be facing sideways.

4097
03:09:31,390 --> 03:09:32,070
That's what's wrong.

4098
03:09:32,510 --> 03:09:32,950
Hey!

4099
03:09:34,090 --> 03:09:34,930
We did it.

4100
03:09:35,090 --> 03:09:36,950
Oh, let me take off my gone fishing.

4101
03:09:37,850 --> 03:09:38,430
There we go.

4102
03:09:42,370 --> 03:09:42,810
Kick.

4103
03:09:42,970 --> 03:09:43,410
Kick.

4104
03:09:43,690 --> 03:09:44,130
Kick.

4105
03:09:44,130 --> 03:09:44,550
Kick.

4106
03:09:44,850 --> 03:09:44,930
Kick.

4107
03:09:44,950 --> 03:09:45,090
Kick.

4108
03:09:46,550 --> 03:09:47,670
Are you done?

4109
03:09:48,550 --> 03:09:49,270
Milk, right?

4110
03:09:49,750 --> 03:09:50,670
And this too.

4111
03:09:50,950 --> 03:09:52,750
I feel like you should hold on to this.

4112
03:09:53,370 --> 03:09:53,810
Here.

4113
03:09:54,350 --> 03:09:54,790
Kick.

4114
03:09:54,810 --> 03:09:55,070
Kick.

4115
03:09:55,270 --> 03:09:55,370
Kick.

4116
03:09:57,150 --> 03:09:57,850
I can't.

4117
03:09:57,950 --> 03:09:57,950
I can't.

4118
03:09:57,950 --> 03:09:57,950
I can't.

4119
03:09:57,950 --> 03:09:57,950
I can't.

4120
03:09:57,950 --> 03:09:57,950
I can't.

4121
03:09:57,950 --> 03:09:57,950
I can't.

4122
03:09:57,950 --> 03:10:00,070
I wish I could get rid of this damn loading bar.

4123
03:10:01,530 --> 03:10:03,330
Maybe in the next loading section.

4124
03:10:04,350 --> 03:10:05,670
It's been so long.

4125
03:10:05,770 --> 03:10:07,350
Maybe over 20 years...

4126
03:10:07,730 --> 03:10:08,010
ago.

4127
03:10:08,710 --> 03:10:11,090
You look exactly like the employee at the time.

4128
03:10:11,230 --> 03:10:12,870
The curse of the bath house.

4129
03:10:13,110 --> 03:10:15,330
It doesn't seem to work on you indeed.

4130
03:10:15,750 --> 03:10:17,630
This seems to be a reason...

4131
03:10:17,630 --> 03:10:17,750
Kick.

4132
03:10:17,990 --> 03:10:18,550
Kick.

4133
03:10:18,590 --> 03:10:18,790
Kick.

4134
03:10:18,790 --> 03:10:20,690
The curse of the bath house.

4135
03:10:21,470 --> 03:10:30,350
You're being targeted, aren't you, by a very strong entity that is much more than a curse, Much nastier than a vengeful spirit.

4136
03:10:31,370 --> 03:10:32,670
Wait, what do you mean by that?

4137
03:10:33,110 --> 03:10:35,490
Looks like they can't touch you... yet.

4138
03:10:36,330 --> 03:10:38,350
I've been here long enough to know a thing or two.

4139
03:10:38,910 --> 03:10:39,390
Wait...

4140
03:10:41,030 --> 03:10:41,990
The landlord!

4141
03:10:43,910 --> 03:10:44,810
The landlord!

4142
03:10:46,250 --> 03:10:47,370
And the priest!

4143
03:10:48,290 --> 03:10:49,610
They're in cahoots!

4144
03:10:50,330 --> 03:10:51,290
Be careful.

4145
03:10:53,910 --> 03:10:55,590
Can I pet the cat now?

4146
03:10:57,430 --> 03:10:58,510
He did purr!

4147
03:10:59,710 --> 03:11:01,030
I think it counts.

4148
03:11:01,910 --> 03:11:02,750
Thank you.

4149
03:11:02,910 --> 03:11:05,430
Can I take those or...

4150
03:11:06,270 --> 03:11:06,930
Ew.

4151
03:11:08,290 --> 03:11:08,950
Oh!

4152
03:11:09,270 --> 03:11:11,390
That's... icky.

4153
03:11:13,810 --> 03:11:14,470
Oh!

4154
03:11:15,150 --> 03:11:16,350
There's dolls everywhere!

4155
03:11:24,940 --> 03:11:26,940
That is a pet cat.

4156
03:11:27,220 --> 03:11:27,540
Yeah.

4157
03:11:27,760 --> 03:11:28,460
Oh my god!

4158
03:11:29,180 --> 03:11:29,260
There's dolls everywhere!

4159
03:11:31,720 --> 03:11:33,760
Ooh, my eyes.

4160
03:11:33,960 --> 03:11:34,540
Alright, bye!

4161
03:11:39,320 --> 03:11:41,540
Do I take this to the bathhouse?

4162
03:11:43,180 --> 03:11:43,580
Wow!

4163
03:11:43,780 --> 03:11:44,980
The market's actually open.

4164
03:11:45,080 --> 03:11:45,640
That's kind of fun.

4165
03:11:50,360 --> 03:11:52,520
I want to be that cat when I grow up.

4166
03:11:52,980 --> 03:11:54,540
But I don't think I can grow up.

4167
03:11:55,020 --> 03:11:55,740
I'm a ghost.

4168
03:11:56,400 --> 03:11:57,200
It's kind of sad.

4169
03:11:59,260 --> 03:12:00,380
Can I have that?

4170
03:12:01,660 --> 03:12:02,140
I don't think I can grow up.

4171
03:12:02,140 --> 03:12:02,600
Hey, you!

4172
03:12:03,200 --> 03:12:03,680
Hey!

4173
03:12:06,050 --> 03:12:07,690
That's my daughter's bracelet.

4174
03:12:08,170 --> 03:12:08,990
Give it back!

4175
03:12:15,800 --> 03:12:16,700
Give it back!

4176
03:12:16,920 --> 03:12:19,000
My daughter's precious bracelet!

4177
03:12:19,680 --> 03:12:20,640
Where is Ryoko?

4178
03:12:21,640 --> 03:12:22,120
Ryoko?

4179
03:12:23,460 --> 03:12:23,940
Oh!

4180
03:12:26,640 --> 03:12:27,540
Woah, woah, woah.

4181
03:12:27,580 --> 03:12:28,040
What are you doing?

4182
03:12:28,220 --> 03:12:28,540
Oh!

4183
03:12:29,940 --> 03:12:31,060
I don't like this.

4184
03:12:31,140 --> 03:12:31,720
I don't like this.

4185
03:12:32,240 --> 03:12:32,720
Ryoko!

4186
03:12:33,720 --> 03:12:34,820
I don't like this.

4187
03:12:34,820 --> 03:12:35,420
I don't like this.

4188
03:12:35,580 --> 03:12:35,900
Oh!

4189
03:12:35,900 --> 03:12:36,040
Oh.

4190
03:12:36,820 --> 03:12:38,500
Oh, I don't like this.

4191
03:12:39,620 --> 03:12:41,140
Yoko... Yoko doko!

4192
03:12:41,660 --> 03:12:42,760
Here, I'll help.

4193
03:12:42,980 --> 03:12:43,240
Yoko!

4194
03:12:44,420 --> 03:12:45,600
Yoko doko!

4195
03:12:45,960 --> 03:12:46,280
Ah!

4196
03:12:47,760 --> 03:12:48,480
Oh!

4197
03:12:48,480 --> 03:12:49,200
Oh!

4198
03:12:49,340 --> 03:12:50,060
Woah!

4199
03:12:50,480 --> 03:12:51,200
Oh!

4200
03:12:51,220 --> 03:12:52,120
Oh my god!

4201
03:12:52,400 --> 03:12:53,780
Oh my god!

4202
03:12:58,540 --> 03:13:00,220
What the guy?

4203
03:13:01,960 --> 03:13:06,520
Oh my god.

4204
03:13:07,240 --> 03:13:07,960
Hey,

4205
03:13:11,220 --> 03:13:11,700
you finished?

4206
03:13:13,380 --> 03:13:14,680
Oh my god!

4207
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:16,980
Did you get hurt?

4208
03:13:18,840 --> 03:13:19,380
Sorry.

4209
03:13:23,560 --> 03:13:25,380
I was so insane.

4210
03:13:28,660 --> 03:13:29,800
Oh my god!

4211
03:13:34,360 --> 03:13:35,220
Are you okay?

4212
03:13:35,780 --> 03:13:36,320
Landlord!

4213
03:13:36,520 --> 03:13:36,860
I was surprised.

4214
03:13:37,440 --> 03:13:39,040
I thought you were dead.

4215
03:13:39,180 --> 03:13:39,980
You surprised me.

4216
03:13:40,020 --> 03:13:40,780
I thought you were dead.

4217
03:13:41,060 --> 03:13:45,200
It'll be troublesome if you died?

4218
03:13:45,280 --> 03:13:47,260
How about just a bad thing if I died, huh?

4219
03:13:47,740 --> 03:13:48,240
Really.

4220
03:13:48,500 --> 03:13:49,820
It's not the right time.

4221
03:13:52,440 --> 03:13:53,340
I'm not joking.

4222
03:13:53,540 --> 03:13:54,400
You can't... Wait.

4223
03:13:56,520 --> 03:13:57,860
It's not the right time?

4224
03:14:00,180 --> 03:14:01,580
It's not the right time?

4225
03:14:01,640 --> 03:14:02,440
What do you mean?

4226
03:14:03,400 --> 03:14:05,360
It's my birthday, Blueslight!

4227
03:14:05,440 --> 03:14:06,420
Happy birthday!

4228
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:09,960
Happy birthday to you.

4229
03:14:10,300 --> 03:14:12,700
Happy birthday to you.

4230
03:14:13,400 --> 03:14:15,940
Happy birthday, dear Blueslight.

4231
03:14:17,420 --> 03:14:19,900
Happy birthday to you.

4232
03:14:23,040 --> 03:14:26,240
Also, there was someone else that said it was their birthday on my birthday.

4233
03:14:26,340 --> 03:14:26,800
I'm so sorry.

4234
03:14:26,820 --> 03:14:27,900
I forgot to wish you a happy birthday.

4235
03:14:28,080 --> 03:14:29,020
Happy birthday!

4236
03:14:31,240 --> 03:14:32,120
I'm so sorry.

4237
03:14:33,440 --> 03:14:33,920
What?

4238
03:14:34,040 --> 03:14:34,720
Oh, yeah.

4239
03:14:35,420 --> 03:14:35,900
No.

4240
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:36,880
Ah, no.

4241
03:14:38,080 --> 03:14:39,400
It'll be troublesome if you don't have a part-time job.

4242
03:14:40,060 --> 03:14:43,640
I just meant that it would be troublesome if I lost an employee.

4243
03:14:47,060 --> 03:14:48,380
This bathhouse is dangerous.

4244
03:14:48,560 --> 03:14:49,080
It's cursed!

4245
03:14:49,420 --> 03:14:51,620
Uh, before it collapsed, I saw what happened.

4246
03:14:51,740 --> 03:14:53,180
Or, you saw what happened, right?

4247
03:14:55,240 --> 03:14:56,700
That was in our brains, right?

4248
03:15:00,800 --> 03:15:02,940
I'm just gonna say this bath... Well, I'm gonna say what happened.

4249
03:15:03,040 --> 03:15:03,120
Hm?

4250
03:15:03,480 --> 03:15:03,680
No.

4251
03:15:04,620 --> 03:15:07,340
When I came here, I didn't see anything.

4252
03:15:07,820 --> 03:15:09,540
When I came here, I didn't see anything.

4253
03:15:10,440 --> 03:15:11,240
I can't...

4254
03:15:11,240 --> 03:15:11,520
I'm sorry.

4255
03:15:11,720 --> 03:15:12,160
I'm sorry.

4256
03:15:13,160 --> 03:15:15,380
Something bad happened, didn't it?

4257
03:15:15,480 --> 03:15:16,880
You must have had a bad day.

4258
03:15:20,080 --> 03:15:22,000
Customer service can be quite tough.

4259
03:15:22,080 --> 03:15:24,740
Yeah, especially when I'm abused verbally all day.

4260
03:15:28,520 --> 03:15:32,540
No, you don't because you're old and everybody here hates young people!

4261
03:15:37,660 --> 03:15:39,760
Why can't I be a hug?

4262
03:15:41,320 --> 03:15:41,800
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

4263
03:15:45,240 --> 03:15:47,480
My design, I understand what you're going through.

4264
03:15:47,720 --> 03:15:49,980
Please, do a little more.

4265
03:15:50,760 --> 03:15:53,040
But, please, keep working a little longer.

4266
03:15:57,080 --> 03:15:57,880
Oh, it's loading.

4267
03:15:58,160 --> 03:15:59,160
Is it gonna get rid of it?

4268
03:15:59,420 --> 03:16:01,440
Yay, the loading bar is gone.

4269
03:16:02,400 --> 03:16:04,720
I just started this job, but...

4270
03:16:05,880 --> 03:16:07,440
I've already packed up my stuff.

4271
03:16:07,740 --> 03:16:08,480
I have no clothes.

4272
03:16:09,060 --> 03:16:10,740
I don't think I can continue anymore.

4273
03:16:11,220 --> 03:16:12,040
I want to quit.

4274
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:14,420
Yeah girl, you quit!

4275
03:16:16,840 --> 03:16:18,080
Is it the landlord again?

4276
03:16:18,440 --> 03:16:20,360
I really don't want to talk to him anymore.

4277
03:16:22,940 --> 03:16:23,660
Ping pong!

4278
03:16:33,450 --> 03:16:34,310
It's the priest!

4279
03:16:40,330 --> 03:16:41,490
What is that?

4280
03:16:44,530 --> 03:16:44,950
What?

4281
03:16:45,070 --> 03:16:45,890
What are those?

4282
03:16:46,570 --> 03:16:47,670
There's so many of them.

4283
03:16:52,090 --> 03:16:52,830
What is it?

4284
03:16:52,830 --> 03:16:53,450
Is it bug spray?

4285
03:16:55,170 --> 03:16:55,590
Cause...

4286
03:16:56,850 --> 03:16:58,190
No, I don't think it's booze!

4287
03:16:58,250 --> 03:17:00,750
It has like the long tip.

4288
03:17:00,930 --> 03:17:01,790
This is not booze.

4289
03:17:04,330 --> 03:17:05,710
I think it's a bug spray.

4290
03:17:07,250 --> 03:17:11,570
I think we have like a bad bug problem because there's a dead person.

4291
03:17:12,010 --> 03:17:13,510
There's a corpse in our house.

4292
03:17:13,890 --> 03:17:14,310
Somewhere.

4293
03:17:15,590 --> 03:17:16,170
There's so much!

4294
03:17:19,110 --> 03:17:21,950
Uh oh, my chat just broke I think.

4295
03:17:22,070 --> 03:17:22,990
Give me a second guys.

4296
03:17:23,610 --> 03:17:24,710
My chat just broke.

4297
03:17:24,930 --> 03:17:26,050
One second, one second!

4298
03:17:36,200 --> 03:17:37,580
Did YouTube break?

4299
03:17:37,840 --> 03:17:38,640
What's happening?

4300
03:17:44,580 --> 03:17:46,340
Woah, what's going on?

4301
03:17:47,140 --> 03:17:48,000
Nothing's loading.

4302
03:17:50,280 --> 03:17:50,760
Nothing's loading.

4303
03:17:51,700 --> 03:17:52,180
What's...

4304
03:17:52,180 --> 03:17:52,500
YouTube!

4305
03:17:54,760 --> 03:17:57,440
Yeah, I'm glad it works on your end but like...

4306
03:17:58,000 --> 03:17:59,580
YouTube is just showing me...

4307
03:17:59,580 --> 03:18:00,600
Here, I can even show you.

4308
03:18:01,460 --> 03:18:03,000
It's just loading like this.

4309
03:18:03,860 --> 03:18:04,660
For me.

4310
03:18:05,900 --> 03:18:07,760
Like I have to go back to the home page.

4311
03:18:09,160 --> 03:18:09,640
And...

4312
03:18:10,860 --> 03:18:11,560
Hold on.

4313
03:18:20,460 --> 03:18:21,840
This is what it looks like.

4314
03:18:24,820 --> 03:18:25,720
What the heck?

4315
03:18:26,780 --> 03:18:27,600
Nothing's loading.

4316
03:18:28,260 --> 03:18:28,740
Oh!

4317
03:18:29,140 --> 03:18:31,900
I think I got it.

4318
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:33,160
It finally loaded.

4319
03:18:33,240 --> 03:18:33,860
Just a little bit.

4320
03:18:34,720 --> 03:18:34,920
Yippee!

4321
03:18:36,900 --> 03:18:37,380
Maybe...

4322
03:18:38,380 --> 03:18:39,120
Kind of?

4323
03:18:39,360 --> 03:18:40,220
Kind of loaded.

4324
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:42,640
Why YouTube?

4325
03:18:42,760 --> 03:18:43,000
Why?

4326
03:18:44,720 --> 03:18:47,060
It won't let me go to the YouTube studio.

4327
03:18:49,580 --> 03:18:50,480
Oh my gosh.

4328
03:18:55,240 --> 03:18:56,580
If I press...

4329
03:18:58,540 --> 03:18:59,260
Refresh...

4330
03:18:59,260 --> 03:19:00,120
What?

4331
03:19:00,240 --> 03:19:00,920
It's not even...

4332
03:19:00,920 --> 03:19:02,860
Is it... Is it... Is it Firefox?

4333
03:19:04,700 --> 03:19:05,620
Might be Firefox.

4334
03:19:06,600 --> 03:19:07,620
Sorry guys.

4335
03:19:07,980 --> 03:19:10,820
I just will read chat from...

4336
03:19:10,820 --> 03:19:11,840
Uh...

4337
03:19:14,220 --> 03:19:15,660
From OBS.

4338
03:19:17,940 --> 03:19:19,160
Give me a second.

4339
03:19:21,900 --> 03:19:23,480
I'll read chat from OBS.

4340
03:19:23,480 --> 03:19:23,840
Sorry.

4341
03:19:26,680 --> 03:19:27,240
Oh!

4342
03:19:29,750 --> 03:19:30,590
Oh gosh!

4343
03:19:33,050 --> 03:19:33,610
Hello?

4344
03:19:34,190 --> 03:19:34,950
Ah, great.

4345
03:19:36,950 --> 03:19:42,310
I have something to tell you.

4346
03:19:42,330 --> 03:19:43,890
Something very important about you.

4347
03:19:44,190 --> 03:19:46,530
I'm a reincarnated Japanese princess.

4348
03:19:49,410 --> 03:19:50,290
There's a basement?

4349
03:19:50,470 --> 03:19:52,090
Please go to the basement of the bathhouse.

4350
03:19:54,350 --> 03:19:54,910
Oh.

4351
03:19:57,070 --> 03:19:57,770
You're in the boiler room.

4352
03:19:57,870 --> 03:19:58,510
Go through there.

4353
03:20:02,010 --> 03:20:02,470
What?

4354
03:20:02,670 --> 03:20:05,590
But please do not be seen by the landlord on your way there.

4355
03:20:06,070 --> 03:20:06,750
Sneaking mission?

4356
03:20:11,640 --> 03:20:12,620
What if I'm caught?

4357
03:20:20,160 --> 03:20:20,680
What's that?

4358
03:20:21,080 --> 03:20:21,940
Is that the landlord?

4359
03:20:24,300 --> 03:20:25,060
Surely not.

4360
03:20:27,400 --> 03:20:27,860
Landlord?

4361
03:20:28,140 --> 03:20:29,360
You don't see me, do you?

4362
03:20:32,620 --> 03:20:33,080
Landlord?

4363
03:20:34,420 --> 03:20:34,860
Hmm...

4364
03:20:35,600 --> 03:20:36,300
I'm sneaking?

4365
03:20:37,300 --> 03:20:37,960
Kind of.

4366
03:20:37,980 --> 03:20:38,920
Actually, I'm just walking...

4367
03:20:38,920 --> 03:20:39,040
Ah!

4368
03:20:39,720 --> 03:20:40,420
Oh my god.

4369
03:20:42,920 --> 03:20:45,540
Hey, did you find something out about my sister?

4370
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:46,000
Did you find something out about my sister?

4371
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:46,000
Did you find something out about my sister?

4372
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:46,020
No!

4373
03:20:49,640 --> 03:20:50,720
Is that so?

4374
03:20:51,400 --> 03:20:51,840
Perhaps.

4375
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:53,640
Is that so?

4376
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:53,640
Perhaps.

4377
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:53,640
Is that so?

4378
03:20:53,640 --> 03:20:54,060
Perhaps.

4379
03:20:54,060 --> 03:20:55,640
Hey, what is your name?

4380
03:20:57,520 --> 03:20:59,000
Wait, what's the third option?

4381
03:20:59,440 --> 03:21:00,780
Wait, what's the third option?

4382
03:21:00,780 --> 03:21:01,600
I can't pick it.

4383
03:21:03,020 --> 03:21:03,920
Happy birthday.

4384
03:21:04,020 --> 03:21:04,680
Thank you, Keiko!

4385
03:21:05,180 --> 03:21:05,420
Happy birthday.

4386
03:21:05,420 --> 03:21:05,420
Thank you, Keiko!

4387
03:21:08,460 --> 03:21:09,400
It's Maina.

4388
03:21:10,060 --> 03:21:11,020
It's Maina.

4389
03:21:12,100 --> 03:21:13,500
Maybe I missed something, yeah.

4390
03:21:14,660 --> 03:21:15,600
That's a good name.

4391
03:21:15,900 --> 03:21:16,380
Okay.

4392
03:21:16,820 --> 03:21:17,300
That's a good name.

4393
03:21:17,300 --> 03:21:17,300
Okay.

4394
03:21:17,300 --> 03:21:17,660
See you.

4395
03:21:17,980 --> 03:21:18,620
See you.

4396
03:21:19,140 --> 03:21:22,220
Oh, we can go in here again and stuff.

4397
03:21:23,800 --> 03:21:24,560
Oh, look!

4398
03:21:24,660 --> 03:21:25,420
We can just... Oh!

4399
03:21:25,860 --> 03:21:26,340
Hi!

4400
03:21:27,220 --> 03:21:30,760
We can just...

4401
03:21:30,760 --> 03:21:30,760
Oh!

4402
03:21:30,760 --> 03:21:30,760
Hi!

4403
03:21:32,020 --> 03:21:34,020
You just taking pictures in here?

4404
03:21:36,380 --> 03:21:37,420
You just taking pictures in here?

4405
03:21:37,420 --> 03:21:38,940
What are you doing in here?

4406
03:21:39,220 --> 03:21:39,680
What are you doing in here?

4407
03:21:40,140 --> 03:21:40,660
Okay.

4408
03:21:41,880 --> 03:21:42,500
See you.

4409
03:21:43,360 --> 03:21:44,860
Everybody here is a cosplayer.

4410
03:21:45,440 --> 03:21:46,620
See you later, then.

4411
03:21:47,940 --> 03:21:48,700
That's funny.

4412
03:21:49,680 --> 03:21:50,800
Thank you for the super time!

4413
03:21:56,420 --> 03:21:59,880
What did I miss that I couldn't unlock that third option, I wonder?

4414
03:22:00,400 --> 03:22:00,640
What did I miss that I couldn't unlock that third option, I wonder?

4415
03:22:01,620 --> 03:22:02,140
Hello?

4416
03:22:03,140 --> 03:22:04,200
What are you selling?

4417
03:22:05,600 --> 03:22:06,140
Hey!

4418
03:22:06,980 --> 03:22:07,520
Emojiro!

4419
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:11,860
Answer my quiz.

4420
03:22:13,680 --> 03:22:14,760
First question.

4421
03:22:14,880 --> 03:22:17,300
What human organ resembles a sweet potato?

4422
03:22:17,540 --> 03:22:17,620
What human organ resembles a sweet potato?

4423
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:18,940
Oh my gosh, he is a sweet emo!

4424
03:22:22,340 --> 03:22:22,880
Um...

4425
03:22:22,880 --> 03:22:24,920
The liver.

4426
03:22:26,280 --> 03:22:26,980
That's right.

4427
03:22:27,540 --> 03:22:28,080
Nice.

4428
03:22:28,700 --> 03:22:30,480
A sweet potato looks like a liver.

4429
03:22:30,700 --> 03:22:32,200
It's like eating a liver.

4430
03:22:32,360 --> 03:22:33,360
I don't know about that.

4431
03:22:34,520 --> 03:22:36,040
Moving on to question two.

4432
03:22:36,220 --> 03:22:37,980
Which one can you eat without dying?

4433
03:22:38,700 --> 03:22:43,280
Pufferfish, a sweet potato sprout, a cherry seed, every option leads to death.

4434
03:22:47,800 --> 03:22:50,300
Is it a sweet potato sprout?

4435
03:22:52,440 --> 03:22:55,600
I know potato can be kind of poisonous, though.

4436
03:22:55,660 --> 03:22:56,840
Pufferfish is poisonous.

4437
03:22:58,600 --> 03:23:00,180
All options lead to death?

4438
03:23:01,940 --> 03:23:04,020
Why can't you eat cherry seed?

4439
03:23:04,020 --> 03:23:05,400
Does it have arsenic in it?

4440
03:23:05,660 --> 03:23:06,220
Or something?

4441
03:23:09,740 --> 03:23:10,140
Ah!

4442
03:23:10,280 --> 03:23:11,080
You guys were wrong!

4443
03:23:12,340 --> 03:23:13,020
You're shit.

4444
03:23:13,160 --> 03:23:14,120
Be ashamed of yourself.

4445
03:23:14,500 --> 03:23:15,380
He's talking to you!

4446
03:23:20,480 --> 03:23:21,280
Answer my quiz.

4447
03:23:21,360 --> 03:23:21,540
Okay.

4448
03:23:21,740 --> 03:23:22,660
I can do it again.

4449
03:23:22,880 --> 03:23:23,280
Liver.

4450
03:23:26,820 --> 03:23:28,280
Which one can you eat without dying?

4451
03:23:28,400 --> 03:23:29,380
I'm gonna try the sweet potato.

4452
03:23:29,940 --> 03:23:30,140
See!

4453
03:23:30,140 --> 03:23:30,260
See!

4454
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:37,980
You guys kept saying four, but it's two!

4455
03:23:38,740 --> 03:23:41,540
You can eat a sweet potato sprout without dying, everyone.

4456
03:23:41,820 --> 03:23:42,820
Today you learned.

4457
03:23:49,860 --> 03:23:51,560
Today you learned.

4458
03:23:56,260 --> 03:23:59,080
Also, I'm pretty sure you're thinking of raw potato.

4459
03:24:02,640 --> 03:24:05,900
Unfortunately, it appears you can't kill people by feeding them sweet potato sprouts.

4460
03:24:08,400 --> 03:24:08,880
Third question.

4461
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:08,880
What?

4462
03:24:08,880 --> 03:24:09,360
Thank you!

4463
03:24:09,380 --> 03:24:10,580
Did someone gift a bunch?

4464
03:24:10,680 --> 03:24:11,060
Thank you!

4465
03:24:11,100 --> 03:24:11,320
Sorry!

4466
03:24:11,420 --> 03:24:13,540
I can't see because I have the...

4467
03:24:13,540 --> 03:24:16,700
My chat... I'm only reading chat through OBS.

4468
03:24:16,800 --> 03:24:17,440
I'm so sorry.

4469
03:24:17,640 --> 03:24:18,140
But thank you!

4470
03:24:19,660 --> 03:24:21,160
Whoever gifted, thank you!

4471
03:24:22,640 --> 03:24:23,500
Third question.

4472
03:24:23,700 --> 03:24:24,800
Which food grows a sprout?

4473
03:24:25,640 --> 03:24:27,360
Dog, human, rat, sweet potato.

4474
03:24:27,760 --> 03:24:28,960
I think it's a sweet potato.

4475
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:31,560
You're doing well.

4476
03:24:31,700 --> 03:24:32,200
I'm impressed.

4477
03:24:32,460 --> 03:24:34,080
Sweet potatoes do indeed have sprouts.

4478
03:24:34,600 --> 03:24:35,460
Fourth question.

4479
03:24:35,900 --> 03:24:36,740
Joy Tom Tom.

4480
03:24:36,800 --> 03:24:37,380
Thank you, Joy!

4481
03:24:37,880 --> 03:24:38,580
Thank you!

4482
03:24:39,620 --> 03:24:40,500
Fourth question.

4483
03:24:40,780 --> 03:24:42,780
One day a young girl came to the village.

4484
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,340
That girl was very pretty and quickly became popular.

4485
03:24:45,780 --> 03:24:47,420
A certain man noticed the girl.

4486
03:24:47,640 --> 03:24:49,740
He decided to have her work at his business.

4487
03:24:51,320 --> 03:24:53,820
But then the girl got stolen from him by another guy.

4488
03:24:54,220 --> 03:24:55,900
So what did the man do to the girl?

4489
03:25:04,060 --> 03:25:07,360
Punched her, locked her up, burned her body, chopped her into tiny pieces.

4490
03:25:09,540 --> 03:25:11,300
I'm not seeing sweet potato.

4491
03:25:17,400 --> 03:25:22,780
I'm thinking burned her body because he said if you put anything else other than wood in there, it smells.

4492
03:25:24,340 --> 03:25:26,840
I wonder, which do you prefer?

4493
03:25:27,840 --> 03:25:28,740
Last question.

4494
03:25:29,820 --> 03:25:30,740
Fifth question.

4495
03:25:30,940 --> 03:25:32,480
What is going to happen to you?

4496
03:25:33,100 --> 03:25:33,400
Oh!

4497
03:25:34,480 --> 03:25:41,540
Get locked up forever, get burned to death, get chopped up, get beaten to death, get drowned to death, suicide somehow right away.

4498
03:25:47,860 --> 03:25:58,340
Do you guys know that like audio that's like making fun of of like true crime podcasts?

4499
03:25:59,200 --> 03:26:09,360
I quote it like way too often but it's just like her arms were cut off, her legs were cut off, her fingers were cut off, her eyes were cut out.

4500
03:26:09,540 --> 03:26:11,620
That's what that makes me think of.

4501
03:26:11,680 --> 03:26:19,420
Get locked up forever, get burned to death, get chopped up to death, get beaten to death, get drowned to death.

4502
03:26:21,660 --> 03:26:23,280
That's what I think of.

4503
03:26:23,780 --> 03:26:25,440
That's so stupid.

4504
03:26:30,400 --> 03:26:31,200
Um...

4505
03:26:31,200 --> 03:26:32,760
Let's see.

4506
03:26:43,100 --> 03:26:46,000
And you are not it!

4507
03:26:46,560 --> 03:26:47,540
Get chopped up everybody!

4508
03:26:48,120 --> 03:26:49,200
Good soup!

4509
03:26:50,300 --> 03:26:52,120
I see, the fun is over now.

4510
03:26:52,300 --> 03:26:53,100
I see.

4511
03:26:53,320 --> 03:26:55,700
Check the sweet potatoes that I'm cooking right now.

4512
03:26:56,080 --> 03:26:58,140
Oh, he's cooking!

4513
03:26:59,160 --> 03:26:59,800
Oh!

4514
03:27:00,200 --> 03:27:00,920
Imo!

4515
03:27:03,860 --> 03:27:04,580
Yakimo!

4516
03:27:05,220 --> 03:27:05,940
Yakimo!

4517
03:27:06,720 --> 03:27:07,960
Can I have that?

4518
03:27:11,160 --> 03:27:11,880
Yakimo!

4519
03:27:12,520 --> 03:27:13,240
Yakimo!

4520
03:27:14,240 --> 03:27:15,620
I saw something.

4521
03:27:19,440 --> 03:27:19,880
Yakimo!

4522
03:27:23,220 --> 03:27:24,420
Oh, it's vibrating.

4523
03:27:26,920 --> 03:27:27,360
Yakimo!

4524
03:27:28,200 --> 03:27:29,320
What do I do with it?

4525
03:27:30,260 --> 03:27:31,280
What do I do with it?

4526
03:27:32,800 --> 03:27:33,680
What do I do with it?

4527
03:27:34,380 --> 03:27:34,820
Yakimo!

4528
03:27:34,820 --> 03:27:35,520
Oh, I...

4529
03:27:35,520 --> 03:27:36,540
Hold on.

4530
03:27:38,140 --> 03:27:38,580
Phew!

4531
03:27:38,920 --> 03:27:40,280
I'm sending it back home!

4532
03:27:41,600 --> 03:27:42,040
Yakimo!

4533
03:27:42,060 --> 03:27:43,480
I'll pick it up at my apartment.

4534
03:27:43,900 --> 03:27:45,460
Hold on, maybe I can make it actually.

4535
03:27:47,260 --> 03:27:48,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4536
03:27:48,580 --> 03:27:49,880
That's where I live, that's where I live.

4537
03:27:51,140 --> 03:27:51,560
Yakimo!

4538
03:27:55,040 --> 03:27:55,460
Okay.

4539
03:27:55,460 --> 03:27:56,280
Thank you, sir!

4540
03:27:57,280 --> 03:27:57,700
Nice.

4541
03:27:57,700 --> 03:27:58,520
Nice, nice, nice.

4542
03:28:02,460 --> 03:28:02,880
Yakimo!

4543
03:28:05,080 --> 03:28:05,500
Yakimo!

4544
03:28:05,740 --> 03:28:06,560
Oishii yakimo!

4545
03:28:07,920 --> 03:28:09,760
Yeah, I can't wait to have that later.

4546
03:28:12,140 --> 03:28:13,020
Yeah, yeah.

4547
03:28:13,320 --> 03:28:15,100
This is gonna be my snack later.

4548
03:28:15,100 --> 03:28:17,480
I wonder if these are actually making it.

4549
03:28:17,980 --> 03:28:19,100
Let's go check real quick.

4550
03:28:22,280 --> 03:28:24,800
He didn't say how many I couldn't have.

4551
03:28:25,320 --> 03:28:26,860
He just said, check them out.

4552
03:28:28,140 --> 03:28:29,500
And I'm a...

4553
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:30,880
appreciator.

4554
03:28:33,080 --> 03:28:33,740
Uh-oh.

4555
03:28:35,620 --> 03:28:37,120
Guys, I don't think they made it.

4556
03:28:39,320 --> 03:28:40,000
Uh-oh.

4557
03:28:41,220 --> 03:28:41,740
No!

4558
03:28:41,740 --> 03:28:41,920
No!

4559
03:28:52,840 --> 03:28:54,760
Sir, they're ghost...

4560
03:28:54,760 --> 03:28:56,260
They're ghost sweet potatoes.

4561
03:28:56,460 --> 03:28:56,960
What do I do?

4562
03:28:57,720 --> 03:28:58,940
He doesn't answer.

4563
03:28:59,500 --> 03:29:00,000
Okay.

4564
03:29:07,850 --> 03:29:09,070
Ooh, the lights are out.

4565
03:29:09,210 --> 03:29:09,910
I don't like that.

4566
03:29:11,810 --> 03:29:13,030
Oh, the lights are...

4567
03:29:13,030 --> 03:29:13,970
Hello?

4568
03:29:17,750 --> 03:29:18,250
Oh.

4569
03:29:21,970 --> 03:29:24,390
The landlord is going to find me at this rate.

4570
03:29:25,250 --> 03:29:26,270
Is that the landlord?

4571
03:29:26,450 --> 03:29:26,630
Is that the landlord?

4572
03:29:28,430 --> 03:29:29,730
I can't see shit.

4573
03:29:33,200 --> 03:29:34,520
Oh, I can't go this way.

4574
03:29:43,240 --> 03:29:43,900
What's that?

4575
03:29:44,140 --> 03:29:44,860
Oh, an apple.

4576
03:29:48,490 --> 03:29:49,010
Wait.

4577
03:29:51,050 --> 03:29:51,570
Oh.

4578
03:30:00,920 --> 03:30:01,440
Uh.

4579
03:30:05,630 --> 03:30:06,750
Is he gonna find me?

4580
03:30:06,970 --> 03:30:07,170
Oh!

4581
03:30:08,770 --> 03:30:09,290
Oh!

4582
03:30:11,690 --> 03:30:12,290
Oh!

4583
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:15,600
Let's take his stuff.

4584
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:21,380
Key to room 201.

4585
03:30:25,680 --> 03:30:28,220
Maybe if I ring it and then...

4586
03:30:28,980 --> 03:30:29,900
Where do I run to?

4587
03:30:30,640 --> 03:30:32,380
Don't just sit there.

4588
03:30:32,560 --> 03:30:33,480
I don't know!

4589
03:30:36,180 --> 03:30:39,760
Yeah, I was thinking sit there and then run to the bathroom.

4590
03:30:50,570 --> 03:30:51,850
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

4591
03:30:52,570 --> 03:30:52,990
Open.

4592
03:30:53,930 --> 03:30:55,170
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

4593
03:30:56,210 --> 03:30:58,690
Even though I don't think I should be listening to the priest.

4594
03:30:59,870 --> 03:31:00,430
You know.

4595
03:31:00,810 --> 03:31:02,790
I could make his water really hot.

4596
03:31:04,070 --> 03:31:05,630
Where's the door he's talking about?

4597
03:31:07,430 --> 03:31:07,850
Uh.

4598
03:31:08,750 --> 03:31:09,650
It's so dark.

4599
03:31:13,070 --> 03:31:13,930
Where's that door?

4600
03:31:14,890 --> 03:31:16,190
We were talking about, guy.

4601
03:31:16,190 --> 03:31:19,510
Look he's bathing in like cold ass water.

4602
03:31:21,730 --> 03:31:22,910
Am I blind?

4603
03:31:30,680 --> 03:31:31,820
Under the wood.

4604
03:31:32,240 --> 03:31:33,000
Oh.

4605
03:31:33,860 --> 03:31:34,620
Oh.

4606
03:31:34,620 --> 03:31:37,100
The most silent cardboard boxes ever.

4607
03:31:39,000 --> 03:31:39,620
Shh.

4608
03:31:43,080 --> 03:31:43,460
Shh.

4609
03:31:45,000 --> 03:31:45,380
Shh.

4610
03:31:47,160 --> 03:31:47,540
Oh.

4611
03:31:50,820 --> 03:31:51,580
Shh.

4612
03:31:52,160 --> 03:31:52,240
Shh.

4613
03:31:53,320 --> 03:31:54,620
Can I move this?

4614
03:31:58,120 --> 03:31:58,620
Oh.

4615
03:31:58,660 --> 03:31:58,900
Oh, there we go.

4616
03:32:02,100 --> 03:32:03,940
This seems like a bad idea.

4617
03:32:04,280 --> 03:32:05,000
Here we go!

4618
03:32:07,320 --> 03:32:08,460
Here we go!

4619
03:32:08,920 --> 03:32:12,060
The worst idea ever.

4620
03:32:13,780 --> 03:32:15,480
I don't care if the guy's a priest.

4621
03:32:15,600 --> 03:32:18,100
If he tells me to go into the basement out of the bath...

4622
03:32:18,100 --> 03:32:19,920
Oh no, is this SCP that...

4623
03:32:20,840 --> 03:32:22,340
Eternal Staircase SCP?

4624
03:32:23,380 --> 03:32:24,000
Uh oh.

4625
03:32:25,580 --> 03:32:26,080
Guys.

4626
03:32:26,320 --> 03:32:27,020
Uh oh.

4627
03:32:27,120 --> 03:32:27,840
SCP game.

4628
03:32:28,260 --> 03:32:28,980
Oh no.

4629
03:32:33,560 --> 03:32:34,560
Uh oh.

4630
03:32:34,960 --> 03:32:35,700
It's a game.

4631
03:32:35,800 --> 03:32:36,360
It's uh oh.

4632
03:32:36,380 --> 03:32:37,700
We're playing a different game now.

4633
03:32:38,960 --> 03:32:39,460
Oh.

4634
03:32:39,620 --> 03:32:41,300
That is the longest staircase.

4635
03:32:45,560 --> 03:32:47,320
No one would go in there.

4636
03:32:50,680 --> 03:32:51,420
Okay, Mina.

4637
03:32:52,880 --> 03:32:54,040
You're a smart girl.

4638
03:32:54,140 --> 03:32:54,780
You see this.

4639
03:32:54,840 --> 03:32:56,200
You see a rinkety bed.

4640
03:32:56,200 --> 03:32:57,140
You see a chain.

4641
03:32:57,880 --> 03:32:58,840
What do you do?

4642
03:32:59,600 --> 03:33:00,840
You turn around.

4643
03:33:01,120 --> 03:33:02,200
You don't go in there.

4644
03:33:05,560 --> 03:33:06,820
You don't go there.

4645
03:33:09,760 --> 03:33:11,320
I think you leave.

4646
03:33:12,260 --> 03:33:13,580
Alright, let's just see what happens.

4647
03:33:14,300 --> 03:33:16,340
Okay, she's probably gonna jump out and scare me.

4648
03:33:19,420 --> 03:33:21,100
I should've gone to the bathroom.

4649
03:33:21,260 --> 03:33:21,960
I'm gonna pee myself.

4650
03:33:22,300 --> 03:33:22,600
Probably.

4651
03:33:22,600 --> 03:33:28,090
What an awful smell.

4652
03:33:29,150 --> 03:33:31,070
What an awful everything, Mina.

4653
03:33:31,590 --> 03:33:32,790
Did someone use it?

4654
03:33:36,690 --> 03:33:37,130
What?

4655
03:33:37,170 --> 03:33:37,950
That sounds like a cat.

4656
03:33:40,990 --> 03:33:41,430
Okay.

4657
03:33:44,650 --> 03:33:45,470
Time to leave.

4658
03:33:46,690 --> 03:33:47,510
Something's still here.

4659
03:33:47,670 --> 03:33:48,270
Oh, there it is.

4660
03:33:48,730 --> 03:33:49,330
Just kidding.

4661
03:33:52,250 --> 03:33:53,030
What is here?

4662
03:33:55,730 --> 03:33:56,570
Awful smell.

4663
03:34:01,030 --> 03:34:02,150
What am I missing?

4664
03:34:11,320 --> 03:34:12,400
What am I missing?

4665
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:14,880
Back corner?

4666
03:34:15,180 --> 03:34:15,760
Here?

4667
03:34:17,710 --> 03:34:18,400
Back corner?

4668
03:34:18,880 --> 03:34:19,460
Here?

4669
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:22,180
Corner?

4670
03:34:23,480 --> 03:34:24,060
Corner?

4671
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:28,800
Awful smell.

4672
03:34:29,340 --> 03:34:30,420
Oh, here it is!

4673
03:34:33,860 --> 03:34:34,480
What is that?

4674
03:34:38,180 --> 03:34:39,200
Oh, there we go.

4675
03:34:42,360 --> 03:34:43,080
Oh, there it is.

4676
03:34:43,520 --> 03:34:43,920
Scissors.

4677
03:34:47,900 --> 03:34:49,580
It moved in my belly.

4678
03:34:49,820 --> 03:34:51,900
It is alive, even in this situation.

4679
03:34:53,480 --> 03:34:55,740
I will not let you die, no matter what.

4680
03:34:55,860 --> 03:34:57,920
I promise to protect you, my beloved baby.

4681
03:34:58,320 --> 03:35:00,260
I will do my best, so do your best, too.

4682
03:35:00,260 --> 03:35:00,800
I'm sorry.

4683
03:35:01,160 --> 03:35:03,100
I will not let them do as they please.

4684
03:35:03,540 --> 03:35:04,620
Oh my god.

4685
03:35:04,840 --> 03:35:05,660
The baby.

4686
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:08,540
Is it me?

4687
03:35:08,680 --> 03:35:09,740
Am I the baby?

4688
03:35:11,360 --> 03:35:11,980
Uh oh.

4689
03:35:14,220 --> 03:35:15,940
I heard the door open.

4690
03:35:27,440 --> 03:35:28,180
You came.

4691
03:35:35,540 --> 03:35:38,320
Long ago, the landlord was captivated by a woman.

4692
03:35:42,920 --> 03:35:47,780
And that led to his obsessiveness, which ended with him locking her here in the basement.

4693
03:35:51,360 --> 03:35:53,540
At the time, the woman was pregnant.

4694
03:35:56,180 --> 03:35:58,160
But the landlord didn't know about it.

4695
03:36:00,040 --> 03:36:01,580
Oh my god.

4696
03:36:06,420 --> 03:36:07,160
Oh no.

4697
03:36:08,440 --> 03:36:11,380
Eventually, unbeknownst to anyone, she gave birth to twins.

4698
03:36:11,800 --> 03:36:14,960
However, she died from blood loss during childbirth.

4699
03:36:20,350 --> 03:36:22,510
The woman was 24 years old.

4700
03:36:22,570 --> 03:36:23,410
The same age as you.

4701
03:36:23,450 --> 03:36:23,750
Um...

4702
03:36:23,750 --> 03:36:25,270
Actually, I'm 23.

4703
03:36:30,410 --> 03:36:31,410
I contacted my father.

4704
03:36:32,730 --> 03:36:36,950
After learning about what happened, the landlord shook with fear and contacted me.

4705
03:36:37,090 --> 03:36:37,790
Oh my god.

4706
03:36:38,450 --> 03:36:42,270
This is the birthplace of Solid Snake and Liquid Snake.

4707
03:36:44,930 --> 03:36:48,610
I gave the twins the names Toru and Elena.

4708
03:36:48,650 --> 03:36:51,350
I gave the twins the names Toru and Elena.

4709
03:36:51,350 --> 03:36:51,750
I gave the twins the names Toru and Elena.

4710
03:36:51,830 --> 03:36:52,250
I gave the twins the names Toru and Elena.

4711
03:36:52,270 --> 03:36:54,790
I gave the twins the names Toru and Elena.

4712
03:36:55,250 --> 03:36:57,390
And left them in the care of an orphanage.

4713
03:36:57,470 --> 03:36:58,650
I'm Elena!

4714
03:36:58,650 --> 03:36:58,810
Elena!

4715
03:36:59,830 --> 03:37:03,810
The name of the woman who gave birth and died here is Yoko.

4716
03:37:04,230 --> 03:37:07,030
The child of Yoko has just returned.

4717
03:37:07,570 --> 03:37:08,250
Oh my god.

4718
03:37:08,370 --> 03:37:10,410
The woman who died here, her name was Yoko!

4719
03:37:10,950 --> 03:37:13,710
The child of Yoko just came back to this village.

4720
03:37:15,630 --> 03:37:16,230
Maybe...

4721
03:37:17,850 --> 03:37:18,450
Toru.

4722
03:37:18,910 --> 03:37:20,550
Yoko's child came back?

4723
03:37:21,770 --> 03:37:22,830
Myna, you're stupid.

4724
03:37:28,700 --> 03:37:30,740
You grew so much, Elena...

4725
03:37:30,740 --> 03:37:32,620
Your real name is Yoko.

4726
03:37:32,620 --> 03:37:33,360
How do you know that?

4727
03:37:35,600 --> 03:37:36,080
I should have told you this sooner.

4728
03:37:36,080 --> 03:37:36,900
That is your real name.

4729
03:37:37,080 --> 03:37:38,560
I should have told you this sooner.

4730
03:37:38,880 --> 03:37:41,120
I noticed it after seeing you working here.

4731
03:37:43,220 --> 03:37:45,940
I saw you working here and that is when I noticed it.

4732
03:37:45,960 --> 03:37:46,180
Yoko.

4733
03:37:46,800 --> 03:37:49,920
Your mother became a child and became the mother of a child.

4734
03:37:50,940 --> 03:37:51,420
Oh.

4735
03:37:51,420 --> 03:37:53,660
Yoko, your mother turned into a child.

4736
03:37:53,660 --> 03:37:56,060
Ubume began to haunt the landlord!

4737
03:37:56,620 --> 03:37:57,080
Let's go!

4738
03:38:01,520 --> 03:38:02,320
Wait, what?

4739
03:38:04,960 --> 03:38:05,360
Huh?

4740
03:38:09,040 --> 03:38:09,780
No, no, no.

4741
03:38:09,820 --> 03:38:12,820
I told the Akihimo man that I was going to be chopped to pieces.

4742
03:38:16,180 --> 03:38:21,780
In order to stop the haunting, the Ubume's child must be burned to death when they get to the age of when the Ubume died.

4743
03:38:31,620 --> 03:38:33,940
Who decided that?

4744
03:38:36,920 --> 03:38:37,580
Who?

4745
03:38:38,760 --> 03:38:41,100
Who made these rules?

4746
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:46,780
That is the landlord's plan.

4747
03:38:49,320 --> 03:38:55,640
No, you called us here so that if one of us escaped, you'd have another.

4748
03:38:57,760 --> 03:38:59,320
I called your brother...

4749
03:38:59,320 --> 03:39:01,060
I called your brother, Toru, here to put an end to this.

4750
03:39:04,800 --> 03:39:09,820
No... I think you were like, if there's one child that doesn't show up, at least there's the other!

4751
03:39:12,300 --> 03:39:12,780
What?

4752
03:39:13,480 --> 03:39:15,320
He knows about the situation and accepted?

4753
03:39:18,300 --> 03:39:20,560
That is why you don't need to be the sacrifice.

4754
03:39:22,280 --> 03:39:23,060
And yet?

4755
03:39:24,200 --> 03:39:25,200
You must run away!

4756
03:39:26,820 --> 03:39:28,440
Oh, he's helping me, maybe?

4757
03:39:28,580 --> 03:39:29,800
Before the landlord finds you!

4758
03:39:31,360 --> 03:39:32,940
Okay, let's go together!

4759
03:39:33,300 --> 03:39:33,600
Priest!

4760
03:39:33,780 --> 03:39:34,160
Priest!

4761
03:39:34,300 --> 03:39:34,460
Priest!

4762
03:39:36,360 --> 03:39:36,960
Priest!

4763
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:38,600
Priest.

4764
03:39:39,700 --> 03:39:40,300
Priest.

4765
03:39:41,080 --> 03:39:41,680
Priest.

4766
03:39:42,100 --> 03:39:43,880
How are you so fa- Priest!

4767
03:39:45,780 --> 03:39:46,380
Priest!

4768
03:39:47,240 --> 03:39:47,840
Priest!

4769
03:39:49,960 --> 03:39:51,260
Wait, my brother- wait!

4770
03:39:51,460 --> 03:39:52,100
There's- wait!

4771
03:39:54,200 --> 03:39:55,060
How'd you go?

4772
03:39:55,180 --> 03:39:56,340
These stairs are so fast!

4773
03:39:56,540 --> 03:39:56,980
Priest!

4774
03:39:57,860 --> 03:39:58,520
My breath!

4775
03:39:58,840 --> 03:39:59,440
Priest!

4776
03:40:01,640 --> 03:40:03,280
Priest's cardio is a hobby.

4777
03:40:03,720 --> 03:40:04,700
For real!

4778
03:40:04,940 --> 03:40:08,100
One second, I'm gonna try and fix my YouTube again real quick.

4779
03:40:08,620 --> 03:40:10,300
Um, that's wild.

4780
03:40:12,660 --> 03:40:14,060
Um, oh my gosh.

4781
03:40:14,140 --> 03:40:16,900
How am I supposed to end the stream if my YouTube doesn't work?

4782
03:40:19,540 --> 03:40:20,400
Oh no!

4783
03:40:23,330 --> 03:40:25,670
Okay, I'll just- I'll just wait again.

4784
03:40:26,730 --> 03:40:27,570
Um, okay.

4785
03:40:27,690 --> 03:40:29,470
So, sneaking mission...

4786
03:40:30,250 --> 03:40:31,650
But we have to save my brother!

4787
03:40:34,010 --> 03:40:36,450
We have to get to room 201, maybe?

4788
03:40:44,220 --> 03:40:44,940
Oh, I'm scared.

4789
03:40:45,060 --> 03:40:45,740
I can't see anything.

4790
03:40:49,880 --> 03:40:51,740
How do I know if he'll see me or not?

4791
03:40:53,440 --> 03:40:55,520
Which one is the door to the ladies?

4792
03:40:55,780 --> 03:40:57,160
Okay, this is the men's one.

4793
03:40:58,620 --> 03:41:00,400
Oh, the ladies one is boarded up.

4794
03:41:00,480 --> 03:41:01,680
Okay, we have to go through this one.

4795
03:41:01,760 --> 03:41:01,900
Okay.

4796
03:41:10,150 --> 03:41:11,270
What's that goopy sound?

4797
03:41:17,400 --> 03:41:18,500
What's that goopy sound?

4798
03:41:20,060 --> 03:41:20,920
Is he in there?

4799
03:41:28,970 --> 03:41:30,050
Oh, do I have to go there?

4800
03:41:31,990 --> 03:41:32,430
Hello?

4801
03:41:35,450 --> 03:41:35,890
No,

4802
03:41:49,040 --> 03:41:49,840
you have to burn me!

4803
03:41:55,020 --> 03:41:56,060
Oh, it's loaded?

4804
03:41:59,580 --> 03:42:00,460
Uh oh.

4805
03:42:00,800 --> 03:42:01,420
Uh oh.

4806
03:42:03,120 --> 03:42:04,740
Oh, wait, what's that?

4807
03:42:07,000 --> 03:42:07,920
Why is there a timer?

4808
03:42:11,000 --> 03:42:12,700
What's the big old timer up there for?

4809
03:42:13,340 --> 03:42:14,180
Oh my god.

4810
03:42:15,260 --> 03:42:15,700
Ah!

4811
03:42:18,240 --> 03:42:18,680
What?

4812
03:42:19,680 --> 03:42:20,120
What?

4813
03:42:24,260 --> 03:42:24,700
Okay.

4814
03:42:26,360 --> 03:42:26,800
Huh?

4815
03:42:27,020 --> 03:42:27,260
Oh.

4816
03:42:28,460 --> 03:42:28,900
Clean!

4817
03:42:29,040 --> 03:42:30,140
Oh my god, what's going on?

4818
03:42:32,020 --> 03:42:32,460
Death.

4819
03:42:32,460 --> 03:42:34,120
This keeps painting death.

4820
03:42:34,840 --> 03:42:35,940
Time to clean, baby!

4821
03:42:38,660 --> 03:42:39,700
This is my job!

4822
03:42:40,360 --> 03:42:41,660
This is my living!

4823
03:42:41,980 --> 03:42:43,020
This is what I do!

4824
03:42:43,080 --> 03:42:43,580
I'm a maid!

4825
03:42:44,680 --> 03:42:45,160
Huh?

4826
03:42:45,160 --> 03:42:45,640
Huh?

4827
03:42:45,800 --> 03:42:46,480
What happened?

4828
03:42:47,420 --> 03:42:48,340
I'm a maid!

4829
03:42:48,500 --> 03:42:49,060
Oh, what?

4830
03:42:49,120 --> 03:42:49,740
Oh, here, again.

4831
03:42:51,100 --> 03:42:52,160
What's that sound?

4832
03:42:54,840 --> 03:42:55,900
I'm a maid!

4833
03:43:01,330 --> 03:43:02,090
Wait, oh.

4834
03:43:02,090 --> 03:43:02,190
Oh.

4835
03:43:05,890 --> 03:43:07,930
Oh now... oh my gosh, they're filling up.

4836
03:43:10,250 --> 03:43:10,730
But...

4837
03:43:14,690 --> 03:43:17,990
Wait, I can't clean unless it's off.

4838
03:43:18,310 --> 03:43:19,370
Okay, I got it.

4839
03:43:21,190 --> 03:43:21,990
Oh my gosh!

4840
03:43:22,930 --> 03:43:23,590
Stop it!

4841
03:43:24,490 --> 03:43:25,270
Stop it!

4842
03:43:25,270 --> 03:43:26,250
Stop it this instant!

4843
03:43:29,930 --> 03:43:30,410
Where?

4844
03:43:31,350 --> 03:43:31,830
Where?

4845
03:43:32,090 --> 03:43:33,010
Stop at this instant!

4846
03:43:34,310 --> 03:43:35,170
Am I gonna live?

4847
03:43:35,270 --> 03:43:35,830
Am I gonna live?

4848
03:43:37,310 --> 03:43:38,150
I can't tell!

4849
03:43:40,810 --> 03:43:42,270
How many do I need to do?

4850
03:43:45,330 --> 03:43:45,890
Uh-oh.

4851
03:43:46,910 --> 03:43:47,970
Can I leave?

4852
03:43:49,270 --> 03:43:50,250
Can I leave, please?

4853
03:43:51,090 --> 03:43:51,510
What?

4854
03:43:51,610 --> 03:43:51,910
More?

4855
03:43:53,730 --> 03:43:54,550
What do I...

4856
03:43:57,070 --> 03:43:58,050
What the hell?

4857
03:43:58,150 --> 03:43:58,750
Oh, a tear.

4858
03:44:02,090 --> 03:44:04,030
I see it, like, trying to come out the wall.

4859
03:44:07,270 --> 03:44:10,890
I see, like, a little bloopy coming out the wall.

4860
03:44:11,310 --> 03:44:11,570
No!

4861
03:44:12,530 --> 03:44:14,310
You shall not pass!

4862
03:44:15,190 --> 03:44:16,890
Yeah, we're scrubbing the ghost.

4863
03:44:18,670 --> 03:44:21,570
I saw it, like, standing through the walls at some point.

4864
03:44:21,870 --> 03:44:22,490
Oh, see?

4865
03:44:22,590 --> 03:44:23,430
You can see it sometimes.

4866
03:44:24,250 --> 03:44:25,430
Waiting its turn.

4867
03:44:26,130 --> 03:44:26,670
No!

4868
03:44:29,330 --> 03:44:29,870
Stop!

4869
03:44:35,850 --> 03:44:37,170
Wait, I didn't get to do it!

4870
03:44:37,310 --> 03:44:37,630
Wait!

4871
03:44:38,490 --> 03:44:39,790
Wait, no, no, that's not fair!

4872
03:44:39,870 --> 03:44:40,630
It bugged out on me!

4873
03:44:41,230 --> 03:44:42,370
Oh, over here, over here.

4874
03:44:43,970 --> 03:44:44,330
Oh!

4875
03:44:47,390 --> 03:44:47,750
Okay.

4876
03:44:53,510 --> 03:44:54,050
There we go.

4877
03:44:54,910 --> 03:44:55,270
Alright.

4878
03:44:57,630 --> 03:44:58,350
Oh, no, no!

4879
03:44:58,790 --> 03:44:59,710
Not on my watch!

4880
03:45:00,190 --> 03:45:01,310
Not on my watch!

4881
03:45:01,490 --> 03:45:02,070
Oh, no, no!

4882
03:45:02,870 --> 03:45:05,250
Oh my god, this should be, like, one of those cleaning commercials.

4883
03:45:10,270 --> 03:45:16,750
Like, I'm... I'm Mint Phantom, and today I introduce you to Phantom Cleanup!

4884
03:45:17,170 --> 03:45:20,770
Do you have a pesky ghost that just won't stop spraying...

4885
03:45:20,770 --> 03:45:21,270
Uh-oh.

4886
03:45:22,330 --> 03:45:23,750
Please, please, please, let me out.

4887
03:45:24,030 --> 03:45:24,670
I'm scared.

4888
03:45:26,410 --> 03:45:26,850
What?

4889
03:45:27,330 --> 03:45:27,770
What?

4890
03:45:28,450 --> 03:45:28,890
What?

4891
03:45:31,050 --> 03:45:31,710
Oh, okay.

4892
03:45:32,410 --> 03:45:33,130
Oh my god.

4893
03:45:35,470 --> 03:45:35,930
Okay.

4894
03:45:37,190 --> 03:45:37,910
Oh my god!

4895
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:39,650
Okay.

4896
03:45:40,330 --> 03:45:40,790
Uh...

4897
03:45:41,470 --> 03:45:41,930
Anything?

4898
03:45:42,230 --> 03:45:43,190
Am I missing one?

4899
03:45:44,850 --> 03:45:45,310
Here.

4900
03:45:48,170 --> 03:45:48,630
Uh...

4901
03:45:48,630 --> 03:45:50,070
Oh my god, oh my god!

4902
03:45:51,210 --> 03:45:51,670
Hey!

4903
03:45:51,730 --> 03:45:51,910
Hey!

4904
03:45:51,970 --> 03:45:52,490
Chill out!

4905
03:45:52,630 --> 03:45:53,210
Chill out!

4906
03:45:53,230 --> 03:45:53,710
Chill out!

4907
03:45:56,030 --> 03:45:57,090
Uh... this side?

4908
03:45:57,770 --> 03:46:02,030
Okay, it's really hard to see when you're, like, glooping out the mirror, okay?

4909
03:46:02,770 --> 03:46:03,250
Stop!

4910
03:46:04,890 --> 03:46:05,730
Did I get it?

4911
03:46:08,090 --> 03:46:09,550
I think I'm too good at this.

4912
03:46:10,170 --> 03:46:11,590
Ghost is like...

4913
03:46:12,730 --> 03:46:14,550
Yeah, this ghost is nasty!

4914
03:46:17,270 --> 03:46:18,630
You're disgusting filthy!

4915
03:46:19,870 --> 03:46:22,030
Look at... look at all this soap all over the place.

4916
03:46:25,210 --> 03:46:26,950
We're doing the best job cleaning ever!

4917
03:46:27,210 --> 03:46:28,130
Oh, change the temperature?

4918
03:46:28,910 --> 03:46:29,490
Wait, what?

4919
03:46:30,830 --> 03:46:32,210
Oh, I see, I see.

4920
03:46:32,490 --> 03:46:32,890
Interesting.

4921
03:46:34,290 --> 03:46:35,430
We haven't had to do that.

4922
03:46:37,810 --> 03:46:40,350
Yeah, you can't get on these mirrors because they're too clean!

4923
03:46:40,770 --> 03:46:40,790
Oh.

4924
03:46:40,990 --> 03:46:41,390
Uh.

4925
03:46:41,690 --> 03:46:42,090
Uh.

4926
03:46:42,230 --> 03:46:43,050
Change the temperature.

4927
03:46:43,210 --> 03:46:43,570
Uh.

4928
03:46:43,690 --> 03:46:44,090
Uh.

4929
03:46:44,270 --> 03:46:44,670
Uh.

4930
03:46:44,710 --> 03:46:45,050
Wait!

4931
03:46:45,770 --> 03:46:46,170
Ah!

4932
03:46:53,240 --> 03:46:54,000
Oh my gosh.

4933
03:46:56,400 --> 03:46:56,840
No!

4934
03:46:56,940 --> 03:46:57,500
I'm scared!

4935
03:46:58,540 --> 03:46:58,980
Why?

4936
03:47:00,120 --> 03:47:00,680
Uh oh.

4937
03:47:02,500 --> 03:47:03,160
I'm running.

4938
03:47:03,300 --> 03:47:04,180
I'm getting out of here.

4939
03:47:05,140 --> 03:47:05,980
Oh my god!

4940
03:47:10,120 --> 03:47:11,360
I think I died.

4941
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:13,240
Give

4942
03:47:22,580 --> 03:47:23,620
me landlord, you freak!

4943
03:47:25,760 --> 03:47:26,580
Wait, what did that say?

4944
03:47:26,640 --> 03:47:27,420
Run away to the apartment.

4945
03:47:27,620 --> 03:47:27,760
Okay.

4946
03:47:30,100 --> 03:47:30,740
I'm running.

4947
03:47:31,740 --> 03:47:32,180
Don't

4948
03:47:37,680 --> 03:47:38,680
come looking for me.

4949
03:47:38,720 --> 03:47:38,820
Don't come looking for me.

4950
03:47:38,840 --> 03:47:38,940
Don't come looking for me.

4951
03:47:39,580 --> 03:47:42,840
My apartment?

4952
03:47:43,060 --> 03:47:43,300
Okay.

4953
03:47:49,420 --> 03:47:50,120
What's this?

4954
03:47:51,340 --> 03:47:52,200
There's a hole.

4955
03:47:52,380 --> 03:47:53,600
Wait, he moved my stuff.

4956
03:47:56,940 --> 03:47:59,740
Oh, I don't even have the key to 201.

4957
03:48:00,520 --> 03:48:01,280
Oh shit.

4958
03:48:01,400 --> 03:48:01,720
Wait.

4959
03:48:02,020 --> 03:48:02,880
Hide somewhere?

4960
03:48:07,330 --> 03:48:07,890
Um.

4961
03:48:11,240 --> 03:48:12,760
Let's hide somewhere.

4962
03:48:13,300 --> 03:48:14,500
What's going on in there?

4963
03:48:15,420 --> 03:48:15,980
Oh.

4964
03:48:16,100 --> 03:48:16,660
Uh.

4965
03:48:16,660 --> 03:48:16,680
Uh.

4966
03:48:18,300 --> 03:48:19,860
See, this is our bug problem.

4967
03:48:21,720 --> 03:48:22,120
Oh.

4968
03:48:23,140 --> 03:48:23,540
Oh.

4969
03:48:24,360 --> 03:48:24,760
Oh.

4970
03:48:25,160 --> 03:48:25,560
Oh.

4971
03:48:27,240 --> 03:48:29,140
See, I don't think she's trying to go after me.

4972
03:48:29,220 --> 03:48:30,500
I think she's trying to go after him.

4973
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:32,920
She's helping me.

4974
03:48:33,280 --> 03:48:33,860
I think.

4975
03:48:34,760 --> 03:48:36,340
Actually, I'm not quite sure anymore.

4976
03:48:44,270 --> 03:48:45,410
Push the cabinet.

4977
03:48:45,470 --> 03:48:46,590
I can't see anything.

4978
03:48:47,810 --> 03:48:48,210
Push.

4979
03:48:48,690 --> 03:48:49,090
Oh.

4980
03:48:52,350 --> 03:48:53,370
She killed him.

4981
03:48:54,570 --> 03:48:55,210
Oh.

4982
03:48:55,310 --> 03:48:55,910
Maybe not.

4983
03:48:58,590 --> 03:48:58,910
Hey.

4984
03:49:02,270 --> 03:49:04,130
Happy birthday to you.

4985
03:49:04,490 --> 03:49:06,390
Happy birthday to you.

4986
03:49:06,630 --> 03:49:09,050
Happy birthday dear red cloud.

4987
03:49:09,230 --> 03:49:11,110
Happy birthday to you.

4988
03:49:13,770 --> 03:49:17,910
Maybe I shouldn't have gone to the front door.

4989
03:49:18,070 --> 03:49:19,010
I thought he was dead.

4990
03:49:19,330 --> 03:49:19,470
Oh.

4991
03:49:21,250 --> 03:49:21,570
Oh.

4992
03:49:21,710 --> 03:49:22,470
Princess Carrie.

4993
03:49:24,350 --> 03:49:24,990
Hey.

4994
03:49:24,990 --> 03:49:26,830
Anybody gonna help me here?

4995
03:49:27,630 --> 03:49:28,270
Hey, brother.

4996
03:49:29,910 --> 03:49:31,090
Brother, you know it's me.

4997
03:49:32,650 --> 03:49:33,090
Brother.

4998
03:49:35,190 --> 03:49:36,270
Did I get the bottom?

4999
03:49:54,930 --> 03:49:57,090
This place seems way less rural.

5000
03:49:57,930 --> 03:49:59,390
In this, like, kind of way.

5001
03:50:00,370 --> 03:50:00,930
Like, see.

5002
03:50:01,030 --> 03:50:02,250
You see the tall buildings and stuff.

5003
03:50:02,310 --> 03:50:04,070
It doesn't look as rural as it seemed before.

5004
03:50:10,330 --> 03:50:10,770
No.

5005
03:50:10,890 --> 03:50:11,810
Not the bathhouse.

5006
03:50:15,530 --> 03:50:15,930
Okay.

5007
03:50:15,970 --> 03:50:16,670
I get it.

5008
03:50:16,710 --> 03:50:17,950
You keep carrying me.

5009
03:50:20,670 --> 03:50:21,070
Help.

5010
03:50:23,790 --> 03:50:24,310
Oh, wait.

5011
03:50:24,370 --> 03:50:25,450
I should say it in Japanese.

5012
03:50:26,970 --> 03:50:27,550
Help me.

5013
03:50:29,390 --> 03:50:29,890
Who is it?

5014
03:50:31,550 --> 03:50:31,950
This.

5015
03:50:44,390 --> 03:50:45,050
Oh, my God.

5016
03:50:45,350 --> 03:50:46,090
He's still going.

5017
03:50:46,210 --> 03:50:46,470
Oh, no.

5018
03:50:46,550 --> 03:50:48,010
He's dragging me over to the furnace.

5019
03:50:48,110 --> 03:50:49,130
He's gonna burn me.

5020
03:50:49,750 --> 03:50:50,550
My birthday.

5021
03:50:50,850 --> 03:50:52,090
Is that my birthday yet?

5022
03:50:52,390 --> 03:50:53,210
I'm not 24.

5023
03:51:09,820 --> 03:51:11,600
You're gonna make her more angry.

5024
03:51:11,740 --> 03:51:12,820
You're killing her child.

5025
03:51:13,260 --> 03:51:14,960
Why would that make her happy?

5026
03:51:16,040 --> 03:51:16,660
Oh, my God.

5027
03:51:16,940 --> 03:51:17,860
I'm seeing red.

5028
03:51:20,680 --> 03:51:22,920
He's just slowly scooting me in there.

5029
03:51:33,120 --> 03:51:33,740
Oh, my God.

5030
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:34,780
Real bad end, huh?

5031
03:51:36,020 --> 03:51:36,740
This sucks.

5032
03:51:39,060 --> 03:51:39,420
No.

5033
03:51:41,500 --> 03:51:42,220
This sucks.

5034
03:51:57,620 --> 03:51:59,800
I am curious to know if this works though, right?

5035
03:51:59,900 --> 03:52:00,900
That looks like a head of hair.

5036
03:52:01,620 --> 03:52:02,720
Are you gonna look up at me?

5037
03:52:08,240 --> 03:52:09,400
Get ending one.

5038
03:52:21,240 --> 03:52:24,020
Oh, each ending has a different song.

5039
03:52:27,100 --> 03:52:27,620
This

5040
03:52:33,210 --> 03:52:33,970
is kind of awesome.

5041
03:52:42,150 --> 03:52:45,250
I like how Ali and Doki are right next to each other.

5042
03:52:57,970 --> 03:52:59,310
I love Whispersang.

5043
03:53:04,390 --> 03:53:05,570
Doki was mentioned twice?

5044
03:53:05,830 --> 03:53:05,910
Oh!

5045
03:53:23,040 --> 03:53:24,140
This is kind of awesome.

5046
03:53:39,290 --> 03:53:40,490
This is kind of awesome.

5047
03:53:47,370 --> 03:53:49,450
I'm gonna have to go back and see what the credit was.

5048
03:53:51,370 --> 03:53:52,950
I'm gonna have to go back and see...

5049
03:53:52,950 --> 03:53:54,290
Okay, that's it.

5050
03:53:57,830 --> 03:53:58,470
Banger alert.

5051
03:53:59,110 --> 03:54:00,690
I wanna hear the other ones too though.

5052
03:54:01,190 --> 03:54:05,870
But I think, even still, if I hear the other ones, this might be my favorite.

5053
03:54:06,010 --> 03:54:08,810
Even though I haven't heard the other ones, it's just because this is so up my alley.

5054
03:54:18,490 --> 03:54:21,890
I don't think I'm gonna go for the other endings.

5055
03:54:21,990 --> 03:54:22,850
I'm really sorry.

5056
03:54:23,730 --> 03:54:28,030
It's because I'm actually... quite tired.

5057
03:54:30,630 --> 03:54:31,830
I'm actually quite sleepy.

5058
03:54:32,010 --> 03:54:33,870
I didn't think this would be a 4 hour game.

5059
03:54:34,130 --> 03:54:40,850
I know I'm kinda slow with stuff because I like to joke around and run around and take my time, but...

5060
03:54:56,060 --> 03:54:56,640
I'm really sorry.

5061
03:54:56,960 --> 03:54:57,760
I'm really

5062
03:55:04,800 --> 03:55:06,240
sorry.

5063
03:55:13,060 --> 03:55:16,140
This already felt so much more polished than like...

5064
03:55:17,620 --> 03:55:18,100
Elmer.

5065
03:55:18,200 --> 03:55:18,720
Oh, thank you!

5066
03:55:20,760 --> 03:55:22,120
Toi Taira Elmer.

5067
03:55:22,380 --> 03:55:23,620
Thank you, I'll look it up later.

5068
03:55:24,260 --> 03:55:25,300
Oh, what's this?

5069
03:55:30,800 --> 03:55:34,640
I just started this job, but... I don't think I can continue anymore.

5070
03:55:34,880 --> 03:55:35,760
I want to quit.

5071
03:55:39,000 --> 03:55:40,360
Wait, it's starting us from here?

5072
03:55:40,460 --> 03:55:40,800
Is this the end?

5073
03:55:40,800 --> 03:55:41,480
Is it the landlord again?

5074
03:55:41,620 --> 03:55:42,740
I don't want to... Huh?

5075
03:55:47,440 --> 03:55:47,960
Huh?

5076
03:55:52,640 --> 03:55:53,400
Maina-san.

5077
03:55:54,400 --> 03:55:56,380
Are you there?

5078
03:55:56,800 --> 03:55:57,520
Oh, look!

5079
03:55:57,520 --> 03:55:57,960
It's her thing!

5080
03:55:58,200 --> 03:56:01,200
I never even noticed her little doll was there.

5081
03:56:01,780 --> 03:56:02,140
Wait.

5082
03:56:03,460 --> 03:56:03,980
Huh?

5083
03:56:08,520 --> 03:56:09,280
Wait, huh?

5084
03:56:11,660 --> 03:56:13,540
Go to the basement of the bathhouse.

5085
03:56:16,460 --> 03:56:16,900
Huh?

5086
03:56:19,620 --> 03:56:21,560
Wait, don't I meet my brother down here?

5087
03:56:21,980 --> 03:56:22,940
Can I tell him?

5088
03:56:22,940 --> 03:56:24,460
Maybe the one thing that I didn't have?

5089
03:56:24,660 --> 03:56:24,940
Maybe...

5090
03:56:24,940 --> 03:56:26,480
Okay, there's gonna be a jump scare here.

5091
03:56:26,620 --> 03:56:27,140
I'm prepared!

5092
03:56:29,280 --> 03:56:33,380
Did you find out something about my sister?

5093
03:56:34,840 --> 03:56:35,280
No.

5094
03:56:36,040 --> 03:56:36,880
What's your name?

5095
03:56:36,880 --> 03:56:38,260
Now I can say...

5096
03:56:38,260 --> 03:56:39,500
Now I can say it!

5097
03:56:39,540 --> 03:56:39,900
It's Elena!

5098
03:56:41,040 --> 03:56:42,020
So you're Elena!

5099
03:56:43,120 --> 03:56:43,540
Really?

5100
03:56:44,360 --> 03:56:44,960
That's great!

5101
03:56:48,340 --> 03:56:50,840
The room 102 is where the priest lives, but...

5102
03:56:52,240 --> 03:56:53,600
He's letting me stay at the room.

5103
03:56:56,680 --> 03:56:58,380
So if something happens, come to room 102.

5104
03:56:59,820 --> 03:57:00,760
I'll be sure to help you.

5105
03:57:00,800 --> 03:57:01,560
Wait, maybe we...

5106
03:57:03,200 --> 03:57:03,620
can...

5107
03:57:05,900 --> 03:57:06,580
do it.

5108
03:57:06,580 --> 03:57:08,920
If I just skip through the dialogue, right?

5109
03:57:11,200 --> 03:57:12,680
If we just skip through the ending, right?

5110
03:57:12,880 --> 03:57:14,740
Oh, but I have to do all the cleaning stuff again.

5111
03:57:25,790 --> 03:57:26,990
Cleaning will be the longest part.

5112
03:57:27,590 --> 03:57:27,970
Yeah...

5113
03:57:29,850 --> 03:57:32,790
I think I remember in the first game, there was a chase sequence.

5114
03:57:32,930 --> 03:57:34,390
So I thought that was gonna happen again.

5115
03:57:35,290 --> 03:57:36,190
You could skip it.

5116
03:57:37,130 --> 03:57:37,810
Oh, no way.

5117
03:57:37,850 --> 03:57:38,030
Really?

5118
03:57:42,570 --> 03:57:43,170
Can I?

5119
03:57:43,710 --> 03:57:44,270
Come on.

5120
03:57:45,010 --> 03:57:46,310
Okay, I'm gonna trust you guys.

5121
03:57:46,530 --> 03:57:47,630
Should we talk to this guy again?

5122
03:57:49,410 --> 03:57:50,830
Sweet potato or is it liver?

5123
03:57:53,270 --> 03:57:54,350
Sweet potato sprout.

5124
03:57:56,470 --> 03:57:57,270
Sweet potato.

5125
03:58:01,010 --> 03:58:02,790
What did the man do to the girl?

5126
03:58:03,110 --> 03:58:03,970
He locked her up.

5127
03:58:05,170 --> 03:58:05,930
Last question.

5128
03:58:06,090 --> 03:58:06,830
What's gonna happen here?

5129
03:58:06,850 --> 03:58:07,490
I'm gonna run away!

5130
03:58:08,270 --> 03:58:09,450
The fun is over now.

5131
03:58:09,590 --> 03:58:09,830
Okay.

5132
03:58:10,410 --> 03:58:11,590
Check out my sweet potatoes.

5133
03:58:12,010 --> 03:58:12,510
Thank you!

5134
03:58:18,540 --> 03:58:19,060
Akimo!

5135
03:58:28,620 --> 03:58:31,360
Like, music started over, so it spooked me.

5136
03:58:31,720 --> 03:58:34,340
Wait, what's the key then to 201...

5137
03:58:35,140 --> 03:58:35,660
Wait...

5138
03:58:36,720 --> 03:58:37,680
This is three.

5139
03:58:39,460 --> 03:58:39,980
Huh?

5140
03:58:40,160 --> 03:58:40,960
Oh, it's this side.

5141
03:58:41,020 --> 03:58:41,340
I'm stupid.

5142
03:58:41,520 --> 03:58:41,800
Sorry.

5143
03:58:42,840 --> 03:58:44,800
What's the key to 201 then?

5144
03:58:45,520 --> 03:58:46,640
Can we use it now?

5145
03:58:48,380 --> 03:58:49,700
I kinda want to go see.

5146
03:58:49,700 --> 03:58:49,700
Let's see.

5147
03:58:51,780 --> 03:58:53,040
What if I do it now?

5148
03:59:01,440 --> 03:59:02,080
201.

5149
03:59:03,280 --> 03:59:04,040
This one.

5150
03:59:06,440 --> 03:59:08,220
I'm breaking in a... What?

5151
03:59:08,260 --> 03:59:10,720
This place is so nice!

5152
03:59:11,640 --> 03:59:12,920
This bastard!

5153
03:59:13,340 --> 03:59:14,960
You even have a real toilet!

5154
03:59:15,460 --> 03:59:19,520
The hardwood floors and everything!

5155
03:59:20,220 --> 03:59:21,040
Landlord's diary.

5156
03:59:22,320 --> 03:59:24,420
I chose to hire a girl.

5157
03:59:24,480 --> 03:59:25,620
She's young and beautiful.

5158
03:59:25,620 --> 03:59:27,260
That will bring in lots of customers.

5159
03:59:27,480 --> 03:59:29,040
Just seeing her lifts my mood.

5160
03:59:29,440 --> 03:59:30,700
The girl works hard.

5161
03:59:30,900 --> 03:59:32,920
She even sends flirtatious looks at me.

5162
03:59:33,200 --> 03:59:34,020
What to do?

5163
03:59:34,200 --> 03:59:35,860
Seems like she fell in love with me.

5164
03:59:36,000 --> 03:59:37,940
Maybe I'll call her by her first name from now on.

5165
03:59:38,580 --> 03:59:41,660
The young hire's name is written as Sakurako, but it's read as Yoko.

5166
03:59:41,880 --> 03:59:43,420
It's a name that's easy to call out.

5167
03:59:43,920 --> 03:59:45,020
Yoko is into me.

5168
03:59:46,460 --> 03:59:48,680
But still, weird guys get in between us.

5169
03:59:48,800 --> 03:59:49,880
Even though she's mine.

5170
03:59:50,240 --> 03:59:50,960
Yoko too.

5171
03:59:51,160 --> 03:59:53,140
Why is she letting those guys get their way with her?

5172
03:59:53,360 --> 03:59:54,060
I have an idea.

5173
03:59:54,240 --> 03:59:55,520
I should bring Yoko to the basement.

5174
03:59:56,480 --> 03:59:59,680
If she's down there, no other eyes but mine will ever see her.

5175
03:59:59,840 --> 04:00:03,020
I will let her know her place while she's in her early twenties.

5176
04:00:03,280 --> 04:00:05,300
It's been a while since I took her to the basement.

5177
04:00:05,460 --> 04:00:06,740
I should check up on her soon.

5178
04:00:06,820 --> 04:00:07,820
You don't even feed her?

5179
04:00:08,680 --> 04:00:10,900
I'm sure she understands what she is to me by now.

5180
04:00:11,060 --> 04:00:12,680
With this, she is truly my possession.

5181
04:00:13,600 --> 04:00:14,620
Yoko was dead.

5182
04:00:15,640 --> 04:00:17,140
Sorry, this is so...

5183
04:00:17,860 --> 04:00:19,620
Lying on the floor in a bloody mess.

5184
04:00:19,920 --> 04:00:21,020
It seems she was pregnant.

5185
04:00:21,260 --> 04:00:22,800
Who could possibly be the father?

5186
04:00:23,340 --> 04:00:24,000
Since when?

5187
04:00:24,080 --> 04:00:25,240
I won't forgive this.

5188
04:00:25,620 --> 04:00:27,240
What is that stain on the bathhouse wall?

5189
04:00:27,500 --> 04:00:29,000
Who is screaming at the bathhouse?

5190
04:00:29,220 --> 04:00:31,020
I can't stop hearing a woman scream endlessly.

5191
04:00:31,260 --> 04:00:32,360
I think I'm going crazy.

5192
04:00:32,740 --> 04:00:35,820
Even after closing time, I sometimes see a person's shadow.

5193
04:00:35,900 --> 04:00:36,740
But no one is there.

5194
04:00:37,160 --> 04:00:37,920
Who is it?

5195
04:00:38,180 --> 04:00:39,640
The black shadow chased me.

5196
04:00:39,840 --> 04:00:43,700
I had a monk perform a cleansing ritual on me, but there was no point in doing that.

5197
04:00:43,760 --> 04:00:45,020
The ghost keeps coming after me.

5198
04:00:45,120 --> 04:00:45,860
Please forgive me.

5199
04:00:45,920 --> 04:00:46,900
I didn't do anything wrong.

5200
04:00:47,380 --> 04:00:50,980
According to the monk, an ubume is haunting me.

5201
04:00:51,380 --> 04:00:55,940
It seems that there is a way to get rid of the curse, but it is not possible to do it the right way.

5202
04:00:57,500 --> 04:00:58,520
Is it not time yet?

5203
04:00:58,700 --> 04:01:00,560
Is it really fine if I let the monk handle this?

5204
04:01:00,760 --> 04:01:01,940
I can't stand this every day.

5205
04:01:02,060 --> 04:01:03,360
The priest says I understand my suffering.

5206
04:01:03,660 --> 04:01:04,500
I have to do something.

5207
04:01:04,760 --> 04:01:06,240
Is there nothing that can help me a moment sooner?

5208
04:01:06,620 --> 04:01:07,240
Hurry, hurry.

5209
04:01:07,300 --> 04:01:08,120
I must end this curse.

5210
04:01:08,280 --> 04:01:09,580
I'll call for her for that purpose.

5211
04:01:10,100 --> 04:01:11,420
No more waiting on the monk.

5212
04:01:11,520 --> 04:01:12,360
I'll do it myself.

5213
04:01:13,660 --> 04:01:14,800
And I got...

5214
04:01:17,500 --> 04:01:18,220
a tile.

5215
04:01:18,600 --> 04:01:18,920
Ew.

5216
04:01:25,900 --> 04:01:27,720
This place is so fancy.

5217
04:01:28,400 --> 04:01:29,700
No vtubers in here?

5218
04:01:29,820 --> 04:01:30,180
Okay.

5219
04:01:34,030 --> 04:01:34,550
Okay.

5220
04:01:37,590 --> 04:01:39,430
There's multiple tiles for collectibles.

5221
04:01:39,610 --> 04:01:40,210
I see.

5222
04:01:43,530 --> 04:01:50,850
I think I saw someone in chat did mention that you had to get all the tiles to I guess get the best ending?

5223
04:01:51,090 --> 04:01:52,030
Is that what that means?

5224
04:01:52,810 --> 04:01:55,270
But we'll still try for this other ending.

5225
04:01:55,530 --> 04:02:01,950
And then for anyone who's curious about the last ending, you can probably just find it on YouTube.

5226
04:02:01,950 --> 04:02:03,450
You can just find it on YouTube.

5227
04:02:26,820 --> 04:02:29,820
Okay, so we'll do this part and then we'll skip the minigame.

5228
04:02:31,620 --> 04:02:32,340
La la la.

5229
04:02:32,500 --> 04:02:33,380
La la la la.

5230
04:02:33,500 --> 04:02:34,380
So, what was it?

5231
04:02:34,460 --> 04:02:36,060
102, right?

5232
04:02:38,120 --> 04:02:39,340
It's 102, right?

5233
04:02:40,100 --> 04:02:42,300
The longest basement ever in the world.

5234
04:02:44,900 --> 04:02:46,020
Yeah, 102.

5235
04:02:46,300 --> 04:02:46,500
Okay.

5236
04:02:46,580 --> 04:02:50,520
I'm sure if I run over there, there will be like a little arrow on it, but still.

5237
04:02:57,280 --> 04:02:58,240
I thought...

5238
04:02:58,240 --> 04:03:09,580
Okay, this might be spoilers for the previous game, but I guess because it's you know, off of Steam it doesn't really matter anymore.

5239
04:03:09,720 --> 04:03:13,820
But I almost could have sworn that the priest was in on it too before.

5240
04:03:14,060 --> 04:03:17,100
Like that used to be the case.

5241
04:03:18,660 --> 04:03:20,000
Alright, we read that.

5242
04:03:24,680 --> 04:03:25,540
Okay, I hear him.

5243
04:03:28,460 --> 04:03:30,100
Yeah, they were in cahoots, wasn't it?

5244
04:03:32,720 --> 04:03:34,060
That was the case in the old game.

5245
04:03:34,280 --> 04:03:34,700
Oh, hello.

5246
04:03:36,860 --> 04:03:37,220
Oh.

5247
04:03:39,060 --> 04:03:40,460
You grew up so much, Elena.

5248
04:03:42,600 --> 04:03:43,360
Yeah, thank you.

5249
04:03:45,440 --> 04:03:46,280
And then run away.

5250
04:03:46,480 --> 04:03:46,780
Okay.

5251
04:03:46,960 --> 04:03:47,800
I'm coming with you.

5252
04:03:48,460 --> 04:03:49,320
I'm coming with you.

5253
04:03:49,380 --> 04:03:49,940
I'm coming with you.

5254
04:03:49,960 --> 04:03:50,600
I'm coming with you.

5255
04:03:53,880 --> 04:03:55,340
The child was locked in the cave.

5256
04:03:55,380 --> 04:03:56,660
Yeah, there was a cave, wasn't there?

5257
04:03:56,780 --> 04:03:57,080
Or something.

5258
04:03:59,740 --> 04:04:00,100
Hmm.

5259
04:04:00,880 --> 04:04:03,040
I'm thinking right now that the priest is the father.

5260
04:04:04,700 --> 04:04:06,640
And that's why he wants to help out his kids.

5261
04:04:08,560 --> 04:04:11,560
He's like, I couldn't protect Yoko, but I can protect my children.

5262
04:04:14,740 --> 04:04:16,140
They changed the plot quite a bit.

5263
04:04:16,280 --> 04:04:16,540
Yeah.

5264
04:04:19,960 --> 04:04:21,000
Okay, so now...

5265
04:04:21,560 --> 04:04:22,820
we go to the bubbly.

5266
04:04:27,820 --> 04:04:30,940
I don't know why, but the water right here looks like a video.

5267
04:04:31,320 --> 04:04:33,980
Like it looks almost real.

5268
04:04:34,200 --> 04:04:35,000
It's kind of freaky.

5269
04:04:37,660 --> 04:04:38,120
Ew,

5270
04:04:44,730 --> 04:04:45,590
I just licked my mic.

5271
04:04:49,090 --> 04:04:50,870
I just licked my mic.

5272
04:04:54,590 --> 04:04:56,910
Alright, how do I skip a minigame?

5273
04:04:58,390 --> 04:04:58,830
Guys?

5274
04:05:00,690 --> 04:05:02,350
Guys, how do I skip the minigame?

5275
04:05:06,760 --> 04:05:07,820
Oh, it's open.

5276
04:05:14,930 --> 04:05:16,270
Oh, I can't go back inside.

5277
04:05:17,270 --> 04:05:18,550
I have to go into the water.

5278
04:05:20,850 --> 04:05:21,690
Oh my goodness.

5279
04:05:24,870 --> 04:05:26,790
That's a nice little mechanic, I guess.

5280
04:05:30,190 --> 04:05:30,850
That's nice.

5281
04:05:33,810 --> 04:05:34,930
Alright, to 102!

5282
04:05:35,570 --> 04:05:36,010
Alright,

5283
04:05:39,890 --> 04:05:39,890
to 102!

5284
04:05:39,890 --> 04:05:41,590
I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I'm

5285
04:05:44,880 --> 04:05:45,640
leaving...

5286
04:05:45,640 --> 04:05:46,900
There it is, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5287
04:05:48,020 --> 04:05:48,880
It lights up.

5288
04:05:49,480 --> 04:05:49,920
Perfect.

5289
04:05:54,710 --> 04:05:55,390
What's happening?

5290
04:05:56,810 --> 04:05:59,390
Oh my god, what's...

5291
04:06:00,030 --> 04:06:01,230
I'm fighting the old man!

5292
04:06:02,990 --> 04:06:04,250
Yeah, kick his ass!

5293
04:06:04,850 --> 04:06:05,490
Wait, what?

5294
04:06:31,900 --> 04:06:33,920
Did he catch you before you made it to the door?

5295
04:06:34,300 --> 04:06:34,400
Did he catch you before you made it to the door?

5296
04:06:36,440 --> 04:06:37,280
I'm confused!

5297
04:06:37,960 --> 04:06:38,080
I'm confused!

5298
04:06:38,120 --> 04:06:39,940
But this is also a different ending.

5299
04:06:43,140 --> 04:06:43,780
Oh wait!

5300
04:06:44,380 --> 04:06:44,960
Wait, what?

5301
04:06:45,180 --> 04:06:45,640
Oh!

5302
04:06:46,900 --> 04:06:47,360
Haha!

5303
04:06:50,940 --> 04:06:51,400
Huh?

5304
04:06:53,900 --> 04:06:54,360
Haha!

5305
04:06:59,010 --> 04:06:59,930
Oh, brother!

5306
04:07:01,050 --> 04:07:02,290
Brother, what happened?

5307
04:07:03,990 --> 04:07:06,410
I'm sorry I couldn't get you at the door.

5308
04:07:06,790 --> 04:07:07,350
I'm sorry I couldn't get you at the door.

5309
04:07:07,350 --> 04:07:08,270
Yeah, you should be.

5310
04:07:10,070 --> 04:07:11,450
Have you guys seen...

5311
04:07:11,450 --> 04:07:13,010
Okay, this is so... sorry.

5312
04:07:14,390 --> 04:07:18,690
Have you guys seen the Lion King, the new Lion King movie trailer?

5313
04:07:20,530 --> 04:07:23,950
And I think it's like, it's the Mufasa prequel, right?

5314
04:07:25,030 --> 04:07:28,590
And in the trailer, one of the...

5315
04:07:28,590 --> 04:07:29,690
I think it... I don't know which...

5316
04:07:29,690 --> 04:07:31,330
If it's Mufasa or Scar, I don't know.

5317
04:07:31,510 --> 04:07:34,090
But he goes, I've always wanted a brother.

5318
04:07:34,950 --> 04:07:39,290
And then they repeat it again and he goes, I've always wanted a brother.

5319
04:07:44,410 --> 04:07:51,690
Yeah, apparently there's a new Lion King, like, the IRL, whatever, live action movie coming out.

5320
04:07:52,310 --> 04:07:56,070
But if you go listen to it, he goes, I've always wanted a brother.

5321
04:07:57,570 --> 04:07:58,850
It's so funny.

5322
04:07:59,770 --> 04:08:02,010
I can't stop thinking about it lately.

5323
04:08:04,330 --> 04:08:08,150
Sorry, okay, I just wanted to break that up because I've been thinking about it this whole time.

5324
04:08:08,750 --> 04:08:10,930
I'm happy that you reached out for my help.

5325
04:08:14,390 --> 04:08:16,470
I was surprised to learn that I had a twin sister.

5326
04:08:16,610 --> 04:08:18,530
Oh my god, wait, the place is on fire!

5327
04:08:18,870 --> 04:08:20,350
Brother, I'm behind you!

5328
04:08:25,170 --> 04:08:26,050
It's actually...

5329
04:08:26,070 --> 04:08:29,730
It's actually quite nice to know that I have a sibling, although I'm not used to it yet.

5330
04:08:30,390 --> 04:08:31,990
Brother, I'm behind you!

5331
04:08:39,870 --> 04:08:42,790
Half a month ago, I received a call from the priest.

5332
04:08:46,550 --> 04:08:49,730
He told me about Yoko, about the past, and about you.

5333
04:08:51,690 --> 04:08:52,850
He told me everything.

5334
04:08:53,370 --> 04:08:54,130
He told me everything.

5335
04:08:56,530 --> 04:08:57,970
Even about the way to break the curse.

5336
04:08:58,210 --> 04:08:58,230
Even about the way to break the curse.

5337
04:08:58,230 --> 04:08:59,470
This is what I need to do.

5338
04:08:59,570 --> 04:09:00,450
Wait, what are you talking about?

5339
04:09:03,030 --> 04:09:04,670
I thought of it as my mission.

5340
04:09:04,750 --> 04:09:05,090
Wait, brother!

5341
04:09:06,310 --> 04:09:07,530
I've always wanted a brother.

5342
04:09:08,130 --> 04:09:11,230
That's why I'm here in this village, not because the priest called me.

5343
04:09:11,930 --> 04:09:14,990
That's why I'm here in this village, not because the priest called me.

5344
04:09:15,130 --> 04:09:15,670
No, no, no.

5345
04:09:17,450 --> 04:09:22,410
I came here on my own vol...

5346
04:09:22,410 --> 04:09:23,290
Oh, brother!

5347
04:09:23,830 --> 04:09:24,190
Whoa!

5348
04:09:25,950 --> 04:09:26,690
Wait, brother!

5349
04:09:26,870 --> 04:09:27,790
I think we're in trouble.

5350
04:09:28,010 --> 04:09:29,750
We need to get away from these plants.

5351
04:09:30,570 --> 04:09:32,390
I came here on my own volition.

5352
04:09:32,910 --> 04:09:35,170
I didn't expect to meet you, though.

5353
04:09:36,670 --> 04:09:38,110
Brother, I think we gotta get out of here.

5354
04:09:38,290 --> 04:09:38,970
Brother, I think we gotta get out of here.

5355
04:09:39,710 --> 04:09:41,490
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

5356
04:09:41,510 --> 04:09:42,550
You didn't do anything, brother.

5357
04:09:44,490 --> 04:09:45,550
What do you mean, Saigo?

5358
04:09:45,750 --> 04:09:46,610
No, no, brother!

5359
04:09:47,050 --> 04:09:48,690
I'm glad I got to see you in the end.

5360
04:09:48,710 --> 04:09:49,450
Wait, in the...

5361
04:09:50,690 --> 04:09:52,610
If I know the tablets...

5362
04:09:53,290 --> 04:09:54,630
Is that how we save a brother?

5363
04:09:56,790 --> 04:09:57,850
Oh, that's right.

5364
04:10:04,550 --> 04:10:05,650
I'll give the seal.

5365
04:10:05,750 --> 04:10:06,050
I'll give the seal.

5366
04:10:06,050 --> 04:10:06,650
I need to leave soon.

5367
04:10:07,110 --> 04:10:07,990
Where are you going?

5368
04:10:08,590 --> 04:10:09,330
No, brother!

5369
04:10:10,090 --> 04:10:10,810
Brother, no!

5370
04:10:11,990 --> 04:10:12,430
Brother!

5371
04:10:13,670 --> 04:10:15,910
Brother, where are you going?

5372
04:10:16,310 --> 04:10:18,230
Brother, don't go in there.

5373
04:10:18,350 --> 04:10:18,810
Brother, no!

5374
04:10:27,780 --> 04:10:29,740
Oh my god, he's so chill!

5375
04:10:30,320 --> 04:10:33,900
He's walking into those flames like such a badass!

5376
04:10:34,680 --> 04:10:35,740
Brother, no!

5377
04:10:36,020 --> 04:10:36,220
Oh!

5378
04:10:38,100 --> 04:10:39,660
I see.

5379
04:10:40,360 --> 04:10:41,000
I see.

5380
04:10:41,800 --> 04:10:42,440
I see.

5381
04:10:43,400 --> 04:10:44,180
Oh.

5382
04:10:44,540 --> 04:10:45,140
Oh.

5383
04:10:47,540 --> 04:10:49,340
So what you're saying...

5384
04:10:49,340 --> 04:10:51,040
Is that a spirit?

5385
04:10:52,020 --> 04:10:53,720
Or a ghost?

5386
04:10:54,140 --> 04:10:56,100
Was haunting the bathhouse?

5387
04:10:56,240 --> 04:10:59,880
Was haunting the bathhouse?

5388
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:01,400
And the curse?

5389
04:11:01,600 --> 04:11:03,960
The sacrifice was needed?

5390
04:11:04,700 --> 04:11:05,760
Is that...

5391
04:11:05,760 --> 04:11:07,780
Toru-san became that sacrifice?

5392
04:11:08,480 --> 04:11:10,900
And Toru-san became that sacrifice?

5393
04:11:11,520 --> 04:11:12,880
And Toru-san became that sacrifice?

5394
04:11:13,680 --> 04:11:14,720
So that's what it is.

5395
04:11:14,980 --> 04:11:16,440
Is that correct?

5396
04:11:17,020 --> 04:11:20,020
Is that what you're going to tell your lawyers?

5397
04:11:20,840 --> 04:11:23,240
Is that what you're going to tell your lawyers?

5398
04:11:23,260 --> 04:11:27,500
You do know that in Japan, it's guilty before innocent?

5399
04:11:28,600 --> 04:11:29,420
Okay, okay.

5400
04:11:29,820 --> 04:11:34,820
Who was it that was telling such a story to you?

5401
04:11:36,160 --> 04:11:36,560
Who was it that was telling such a story to you?

5402
04:11:36,560 --> 04:11:36,640
Who was it that was telling such a story to you?

5403
04:11:37,900 --> 04:11:38,800
Who, you ask?

5404
04:11:39,880 --> 04:11:40,560
What do you mean?

5405
04:11:41,800 --> 04:11:42,580
What does that mean?

5406
04:11:43,320 --> 04:11:44,700
Oh, what the hell is that?

5407
04:11:46,980 --> 04:11:47,380
Huh?

5408
04:11:48,660 --> 04:11:49,960
Why did I pull that out?

5409
04:11:50,920 --> 04:11:53,220
By the way, did I show you my stick?

5410
04:11:53,400 --> 04:11:53,560
By the way, did I show you my stick?

5411
04:11:53,560 --> 04:11:54,940
It was hidden in my omamori.

5412
04:11:57,500 --> 04:11:59,660
Yo, the bathhouse got cooked.

5413
04:12:00,060 --> 04:12:00,160
Yo, the bathhouse got cooked.

5414
04:12:06,770 --> 04:12:08,730
Was it an umbilical cord?

5415
04:12:09,410 --> 04:12:11,190
Oh, we get like a cutscene.

5416
04:12:12,510 --> 04:12:14,950
The building is still on fire.

5417
04:12:15,410 --> 04:12:15,570
The building is still on fire.

5418
04:12:16,730 --> 04:12:18,710
Yeah, it's even still on fire.

5419
04:12:19,130 --> 04:12:20,250
Yeah, it's even still on fire.

5420
04:12:20,250 --> 04:12:22,450
That's where all the furniture flew around.

5421
04:12:23,070 --> 04:12:24,590
That's where we saw grandma.

5422
04:12:30,510 --> 04:12:32,330
That's where we saw grandma.

5423
04:12:32,330 --> 04:12:34,370
Oh, I'm so nostalgic right now.

5424
04:12:36,490 --> 04:12:37,790
Good times, yeah.

5425
04:12:38,270 --> 04:12:40,170
We have been when it wasn't.

5426
04:12:40,210 --> 04:12:41,350
Which was all the time.

5427
04:12:43,690 --> 04:12:46,870
Oh, is that the bathroom with the squatty toilet?

5428
04:12:47,290 --> 04:12:48,550
Oh, good times.

5429
04:12:49,370 --> 04:12:50,090
Oh, what's that?

5430
04:12:51,070 --> 04:12:52,110
Oh, that's the boiler.

5431
04:12:55,510 --> 04:12:57,030
Is she going to jump out of there?

5432
04:12:58,430 --> 04:12:58,890
Mom!

5433
04:12:58,890 --> 04:12:59,350
Mom!

5434
04:13:00,050 --> 04:13:00,850
Don't do it, mom!

5435
04:13:01,150 --> 04:13:01,610
Mom.

5436
04:13:02,330 --> 04:13:02,570
Mom!

5437
04:13:03,350 --> 04:13:04,490
I'm scared of you, mom.

5438
04:13:04,630 --> 04:13:05,770
Oh, there she is.

5439
04:13:06,850 --> 04:13:07,970
Is she shutting the door?

5440
04:13:10,310 --> 04:13:11,270
She's like, goodnight.

5441
04:13:13,530 --> 04:13:14,310
Ending 2.

5442
04:13:17,050 --> 04:13:17,710
Wait, what?

5443
04:13:18,910 --> 04:13:20,230
Oh, this is the second ending.

5444
04:13:20,330 --> 04:13:20,730
Song.

5445
04:13:22,690 --> 04:13:24,490
I always come back.

5446
04:13:25,110 --> 04:13:31,610
I like how the assets are like clipping in and out even in the ending.

5447
04:13:31,810 --> 04:13:32,290
I like how the assets are like clipping in and out even in the ending.

5448
04:13:35,930 --> 04:13:38,710
Nah, the first song was so much better.

5449
04:13:38,990 --> 04:13:39,190
Nah, the first song was so much better.

5450
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:45,300
Look up the best ending.

5451
04:13:45,660 --> 04:13:49,460
Look up the best ending.

5452
04:13:49,460 --> 04:13:50,380
I will, yeah.

5453
04:13:51,560 --> 04:13:53,640
I will, yeah.

5454
04:13:57,660 --> 04:13:58,580
It's not bad.

5455
04:13:58,980 --> 04:13:59,480
It's not bad.

5456
04:13:59,480 --> 04:14:00,740
Why is Doki Bird on here twice?

5457
04:14:01,520 --> 04:14:02,600
Like, you guys were right.

5458
04:14:02,720 --> 04:14:03,320
She was there twice.

5459
04:14:05,380 --> 04:14:06,080
It's not bad.

5460
04:14:06,080 --> 04:14:07,520
I just like the first one better.

5461
04:14:09,620 --> 04:14:11,860
I missed the celebration yesterday because I was busy.

5462
04:14:12,060 --> 04:14:12,580
No worries!

5463
04:14:14,300 --> 04:14:15,280
Thank you for the super chat!

5464
04:14:15,400 --> 04:14:16,300
Sorry, I didn't get to read the rest.

5465
04:14:16,420 --> 04:14:18,040
My YouTube is broken.

5466
04:14:20,980 --> 04:14:23,820
Will your ashes be scattered to the heartless sea?

5467
04:14:24,040 --> 04:14:25,280
I just saw your dono.

5468
04:14:25,380 --> 04:14:26,160
David, thank you.

5469
04:14:28,780 --> 04:14:29,580
Doki Doki.

5470
04:14:30,060 --> 04:14:30,800
Doki Doki.

5471
04:14:31,600 --> 04:14:32,280
Doki Doki.

5472
04:14:33,440 --> 04:14:33,960
Doki Doki.

5473
04:14:33,960 --> 04:14:34,480
This song is pretty good.

5474
04:14:34,600 --> 04:14:34,840
Oh, yeah?

5475
04:14:37,560 --> 04:14:39,340
I do like going around the...

5476
04:14:40,480 --> 04:14:41,940
I kind of wish...

5477
04:14:41,940 --> 04:14:43,120
I mean, I know like...

5478
04:14:43,780 --> 04:14:45,780
This is probably like an asset or whatever.

5479
04:14:46,020 --> 04:14:48,940
I wish there was like some burnt parts of the...

5480
04:14:48,940 --> 04:14:50,420
Like, you know, you see the fridge.

5481
04:14:50,980 --> 04:14:52,080
You see the...

5482
04:14:52,080 --> 04:14:53,420
The burnt table.

5483
04:14:53,560 --> 04:14:54,520
I wish there was stuff like that.

5484
04:14:56,680 --> 04:14:58,880
Is that someone's birthday?

5485
04:14:59,280 --> 04:15:00,100
Wait, who's birthday?

5486
04:15:00,300 --> 04:15:01,140
Happy birthday!

5487
04:15:03,960 --> 04:15:05,420
Don't scatter me, please.

5488
04:15:06,140 --> 04:15:08,200
Scatter ashes to the heartless sea.

5489
04:15:09,560 --> 04:15:11,480
No, you don't scatter the ashes.

5490
04:15:11,540 --> 04:15:12,860
You rub them all over your face.

5491
04:15:13,900 --> 04:15:14,800
Come here, ashes!

5492
04:15:25,390 --> 04:15:27,430
Oh, this is a short song, even.

5493
04:15:30,890 --> 04:15:32,170
Make them into diamonds.

5494
04:15:42,880 --> 04:15:44,660
Luckily, it didn't take so much to...

5495
04:15:45,520 --> 04:15:46,500
Get to this ending.

5496
04:15:46,600 --> 04:15:48,900
I do really appreciate that they allow you to skip the...

5497
04:15:50,600 --> 04:15:52,700
Skip the minigame.

5498
04:15:55,120 --> 04:15:57,200
I guess the final boss.

5499
04:15:57,580 --> 04:15:58,480
But I'm curious.

5500
04:15:58,580 --> 04:16:00,640
I never saw any other tiles.

5501
04:16:02,120 --> 04:16:05,100
I'm very curious where they are now.

5502
04:16:05,420 --> 04:16:06,080
You know?

5503
04:16:11,260 --> 04:16:12,960
I never saw a single one.

5504
04:16:13,060 --> 04:16:15,160
And I kind of like walked around a bunch of places.

5505
04:16:15,360 --> 04:16:16,160
And kind of like...

5506
04:16:17,700 --> 04:16:18,820
Sniffed around a bunch.

5507
04:16:19,380 --> 04:16:19,820
Sniffed around a bunch.

5508
04:16:19,820 --> 04:16:21,420
There's one on the supporter scoreboard.

5509
04:16:22,480 --> 04:16:24,680
Maybe just because I didn't know where to look for them.

5510
04:16:26,060 --> 04:16:26,500
Maybe just because I didn't know where to look for them.

5511
04:16:26,500 --> 04:16:26,720
Maybe.

5512
04:16:28,780 --> 04:16:30,720
Maybe they didn't have like a little...

5513
04:16:30,720 --> 04:16:30,960
Maybe they didn't have like a little...

5514
04:16:31,500 --> 04:16:33,180
Little arrow above it, you know?

5515
04:16:33,200 --> 04:16:34,720
So I just didn't think to look.

5516
04:16:36,580 --> 04:16:37,600
How many are there?

5517
04:16:37,980 --> 04:16:39,660
I'm curious if anybody knows.

5518
04:16:44,370 --> 04:16:47,030
Because I definitely don't want to go through the whole game all over again.

5519
04:16:47,250 --> 04:16:47,310
Because I definitely don't want to go through the whole game all over again.

5520
04:16:47,830 --> 04:16:49,250
One is answering...

5521
04:16:49,250 --> 04:16:50,650
Sweet potato man's questions correctly.

5522
04:16:50,990 --> 04:16:51,310
What?

5523
04:16:52,090 --> 04:16:55,110
Oh, maybe I needed to actually move the emu.

5524
04:16:55,610 --> 04:16:56,610
The sweet potato.

5525
04:16:56,850 --> 04:16:58,910
And it would be buried under the sweet potato?

5526
04:16:59,130 --> 04:17:00,490
Oh my god.

5527
04:17:02,190 --> 04:17:03,810
Yeah, this wasn't highlighted in yellow.

5528
04:17:03,850 --> 04:17:04,310
Yeah, yeah.

5529
04:17:05,670 --> 04:17:07,330
They revealed the tile at the very end...

5530
04:17:07,330 --> 04:17:07,930
For replayability.

5531
04:17:08,530 --> 04:17:09,470
Basic game design.

5532
04:17:10,050 --> 04:17:11,950
Actually, they only revealed it...

5533
04:17:12,630 --> 04:17:15,110
Actually, if I had never gone to the bedroom...

5534
04:17:15,850 --> 04:17:16,990
I never would have known.

5535
04:17:18,990 --> 04:17:19,430
Hmm.

5536
04:17:21,010 --> 04:17:21,930
Maybe it was four.

5537
04:17:22,110 --> 04:17:23,110
So one in the...

5538
04:17:23,110 --> 04:17:24,330
Yeah, it would have to be four, right?

5539
04:17:24,390 --> 04:17:25,170
Because it was square.

5540
04:17:25,550 --> 04:17:27,210
So one at the shooting range.

5541
04:17:27,270 --> 04:17:28,250
One in his bedroom.

5542
04:17:30,470 --> 04:17:30,910
One...

5543
04:17:33,490 --> 04:17:34,690
Oh, they let you start here.

5544
04:17:34,910 --> 04:17:35,290
Yeah.

5545
04:17:36,190 --> 04:17:38,170
One at the emu.

5546
04:17:38,310 --> 04:17:39,570
And then...

5547
04:17:42,910 --> 04:17:43,350
Another.

5548
04:17:48,170 --> 04:17:48,750
Somewhere.

5549
04:17:48,990 --> 04:17:50,950
Another one in a mysterious location.

5550
04:17:52,670 --> 04:17:54,710
I like how the hair like...

5551
04:17:55,890 --> 04:17:57,050
Slips off of you.

5552
04:17:57,110 --> 04:17:58,910
And that's how you start this part.

5553
04:17:59,210 --> 04:17:59,670
It's kind of neat.

5554
04:18:01,490 --> 04:18:02,590
I do like that.

5555
04:18:05,310 --> 04:18:06,170
What is this?

5556
04:18:08,050 --> 04:18:08,630
Oh!

5557
04:18:10,450 --> 04:18:11,030
Gross!

5558
04:18:11,430 --> 04:18:12,850
Oh, we have...

5559
04:18:12,850 --> 04:18:13,590
What?

5560
04:18:14,870 --> 04:18:16,630
It's our umbilical...

5561
04:18:17,310 --> 04:18:17,690
It was in there!

5562
04:18:19,890 --> 04:18:23,030
That was pretty insane compared to the OG and other Chilla's games.

5563
04:18:23,270 --> 04:18:24,270
At least you got to shoot Doki.

5564
04:18:24,450 --> 04:18:24,690
Goodnight!

5565
04:18:24,890 --> 04:18:25,130
Goodnight!

5566
04:18:26,230 --> 04:18:28,450
Oh my god, it's an umbilical cord!

5567
04:18:31,710 --> 04:18:33,310
And then we have his room key.

5568
04:18:35,670 --> 04:18:36,110
Neat!

5569
04:18:36,110 --> 04:18:37,730
It's so cool that they give you this stuff.

5570
04:18:38,670 --> 04:18:39,490
Like right here.

5571
04:18:40,650 --> 04:18:41,370
So, hold on.

5572
04:18:41,450 --> 04:18:42,830
I want to go quit real quick.

5573
04:18:44,190 --> 04:18:45,310
And then if we continue...

5574
04:18:46,230 --> 04:18:47,170
Oh, so it does...

5575
04:18:47,310 --> 04:18:47,570
Okay.

5576
04:18:48,850 --> 04:18:51,870
But obviously we would start at day one if we wanted to get the...

5577
04:18:52,870 --> 04:18:53,270
That...

5578
04:18:53,270 --> 04:18:54,370
Last ending.

5579
04:18:54,930 --> 04:18:55,650
Let me see.

5580
04:18:55,690 --> 04:18:57,210
I wonder if I can find like a...

5581
04:18:57,210 --> 04:18:57,810
Oh wait.

5582
04:18:57,890 --> 04:18:58,830
No, my YouTube is broken.

5583
04:19:00,210 --> 04:19:01,430
Guys, I would watch it...

5584
04:19:01,430 --> 04:19:03,070
But my YouTube is literally...

5585
04:19:05,170 --> 04:19:05,970
I can't...

5586
04:19:07,130 --> 04:19:08,350
It's not loading anything.

5587
04:19:08,570 --> 04:19:09,450
Even now...

5588
04:19:09,450 --> 04:19:11,450
I'm going to quit the game and see if it helps.

5589
04:19:12,830 --> 04:19:15,490
Maybe it's like... Maybe the game is possessing my computer.

5590
04:19:17,690 --> 04:19:18,750
Restart my browser?

5591
04:19:18,970 --> 04:19:19,870
Yeah, let's try that.

5592
04:19:22,450 --> 04:19:24,870
Because otherwise, how am I going to quit...

5593
04:19:24,870 --> 04:19:26,130
The stream?

5594
04:19:30,050 --> 04:19:31,810
How am I going to end the stream?

5595
04:19:33,270 --> 04:19:33,990
Uh oh.

5596
04:19:34,110 --> 04:19:35,650
I think it might be Firefox.

5597
04:19:38,130 --> 04:19:39,170
Firefox is...

5598
04:19:39,990 --> 04:19:41,750
Not opening back up.

5599
04:19:47,400 --> 04:19:48,120
Uh oh.

5600
04:19:53,110 --> 04:19:53,670
Uh...

5601
04:19:55,350 --> 04:19:55,910
Oh!

5602
04:19:56,270 --> 04:19:57,430
It opened!

5603
04:19:57,530 --> 04:19:57,770
It opened!

5604
04:19:57,870 --> 04:19:58,090
It opened!

5605
04:19:58,150 --> 04:19:58,710
Oh!

5606
04:19:59,470 --> 04:20:00,450
It's loaded!

5607
04:20:00,750 --> 04:20:01,730
Okay, let's see.

5608
04:20:04,150 --> 04:20:04,710
Bathhouse...

5609
04:20:04,710 --> 04:20:05,890
Ending 3.

5610
04:20:07,650 --> 04:20:09,210
I want to see if I can...

5611
04:20:09,210 --> 04:20:10,530
Oh, 30 minutes.

5612
04:20:14,910 --> 04:20:16,030
Oh wait.

5613
04:20:16,110 --> 04:20:16,730
This one says...

5614
04:20:16,730 --> 04:20:17,610
All endings.

5615
04:20:20,310 --> 04:20:20,970
Hold on.

5616
04:20:21,210 --> 04:20:22,790
Let me see if there's someone talking over it.

5617
04:20:27,340 --> 04:20:28,220
Okay, no, no, no.

5618
04:20:28,320 --> 04:20:28,860
I think we're good.

5619
04:20:30,540 --> 04:20:31,690
Let me see if I can find...

5620
04:20:34,400 --> 04:20:34,780
Um...

5621
04:20:37,300 --> 04:20:37,680
Um...

5622
04:20:37,680 --> 04:20:38,080
Um...

5623
04:20:39,100 --> 04:20:39,480
Um...

5624
04:20:40,320 --> 04:20:41,820
Let's see if I can find...

5625
04:20:41,820 --> 04:20:43,340
The final ending.

5626
04:20:43,480 --> 04:20:43,900
Okay, here.

5627
04:20:45,500 --> 04:20:46,260
Okay, okay, okay.

5628
04:20:46,360 --> 04:20:47,220
Give me a second.

5629
04:20:48,480 --> 04:20:49,240
Let's uh...

5630
04:20:49,240 --> 04:20:50,500
I'm going to...

5631
04:20:51,040 --> 04:20:52,440
We'll watch it on here.

5632
04:20:53,540 --> 04:20:55,760
Hold on, let me pull my chat back up to...

5633
04:20:55,760 --> 04:20:57,880
Give me one second.

5634
04:20:59,520 --> 04:21:01,160
Give me one second.

5635
04:21:01,160 --> 04:21:04,980
What is with the weird comments that are just like...

5636
04:21:04,980 --> 04:21:05,580
What is with the weird comments that are just like...

5637
04:21:05,580 --> 04:21:06,420
People's names.

5638
04:21:06,980 --> 04:21:09,680
Usually spam comments are just like...

5639
04:21:09,680 --> 04:21:11,580
Oh yeah, they're paying for like this.

5640
04:21:11,700 --> 04:21:13,080
But like, I don't understand it.

5641
04:21:13,500 --> 04:21:14,000
But like, I don't understand it.

5642
04:21:15,040 --> 04:21:16,600
When it's like just the names.

5643
04:21:16,900 --> 04:21:18,280
Oh wait, that's not what I meant to do.

5644
04:21:19,500 --> 04:21:20,920
Alright, this is the last ending.

5645
04:21:20,920 --> 04:21:21,720
Uh...

5646
04:21:21,720 --> 04:21:23,520
Courtesy of Iridos Gaming.

5647
04:21:23,880 --> 04:21:24,360
Thank you.

5648
04:21:26,260 --> 04:21:27,180
Oops, hold on.

5649
04:21:27,700 --> 04:21:28,400
There we go.

5650
04:21:29,280 --> 04:21:30,460
Bots are so weird.

5651
04:21:30,640 --> 04:21:31,700
Usually if it's just like...

5652
04:21:31,700 --> 04:21:34,400
Oh yeah, come to my website for sexy time.

5653
04:21:34,640 --> 04:21:35,400
Like that would make sense.

5654
04:21:35,540 --> 04:21:37,460
But this doesn't make any sense to me.

5655
04:21:38,960 --> 04:21:39,440
Uh...

5656
04:21:40,200 --> 04:21:40,680
Um...

5657
04:21:41,760 --> 04:21:44,360
I heard it's to trigger real names through blacklist.

5658
04:21:48,400 --> 04:21:49,080
But like...

5659
04:21:49,080 --> 04:21:51,420
Some people just have that as their YouTube.

5660
04:21:52,080 --> 04:21:52,960
You know what I mean?

5661
04:21:53,060 --> 04:21:54,100
Like some people's...

5662
04:21:54,100 --> 04:21:56,060
Their name is their YouTube name.

5663
04:21:58,580 --> 04:21:59,440
I don't know.

5664
04:22:04,310 --> 04:22:06,290
Alright, let's watch the last ending.

5665
04:22:07,250 --> 04:22:08,090
Right here.

5666
04:22:14,090 --> 04:22:14,810
Okie dokie.

5667
04:22:17,330 --> 04:22:19,050
Oh, sorry for the white border.

5668
04:22:19,190 --> 04:22:19,530
Hold on.

5669
04:22:20,050 --> 04:22:22,230
It's gonna annoy me too.

5670
04:22:22,670 --> 04:22:23,170
Wait.

5671
04:22:24,590 --> 04:22:25,590
Uh... yeah.

5672
04:22:26,970 --> 04:22:27,830
There we...

5673
04:22:27,830 --> 04:22:28,730
Go.

5674
04:22:29,050 --> 04:22:29,730
Good enough.

5675
04:22:30,610 --> 04:22:31,090
There.

5676
04:22:31,170 --> 04:22:31,690
Good enough.

5677
04:22:31,850 --> 04:22:32,790
Ok, let's watch.

5678
04:22:43,010 --> 04:22:43,590
Okie.

5679
04:22:46,550 --> 04:22:47,130
Okie.

5680
04:22:48,740 --> 04:22:49,030
Oh.

5681
04:22:49,630 --> 04:22:51,950
Oh, we have the umbilical cord.

5682
04:22:53,050 --> 04:22:54,530
Do we give it to our mom?

5683
04:22:54,850 --> 04:22:55,570
Mom, look.

5684
04:22:56,270 --> 04:22:58,130
It's my... It's us.

5685
04:22:59,010 --> 04:23:00,930
Hot bath house is in your area.

5686
04:23:01,670 --> 04:23:02,570
Mom, look.

5687
04:23:02,590 --> 04:23:02,970
It's us.

5688
04:23:02,990 --> 04:23:03,950
Oh.

5689
04:23:04,830 --> 04:23:05,830
There you go.

5690
04:23:09,450 --> 04:23:10,770
My mom...

5691
04:23:10,770 --> 04:23:11,530
Is cute.

5692
04:23:15,360 --> 04:23:16,040
Aww.

5693
04:23:16,640 --> 04:23:17,800
The umbilical cord.

5694
04:23:19,580 --> 04:23:20,260
I'm...

5695
04:23:20,260 --> 04:23:20,440
Oh.

5696
04:23:20,720 --> 04:23:21,280
Bye, mom.

5697
04:23:24,340 --> 04:23:26,140
It does that so curse.

5698
04:23:26,280 --> 04:23:26,920
What do you mean?

5699
04:23:27,320 --> 04:23:28,740
The graphics are...

5700
04:23:28,740 --> 04:23:31,620
Actually, they're probably playing this on high.

5701
04:23:31,920 --> 04:23:33,460
Or on, like, ultra.

5702
04:23:33,900 --> 04:23:34,340
Oh.

5703
04:23:34,440 --> 04:23:35,120
Oh my god.

5704
04:23:35,200 --> 04:23:36,540
I only played it on high.

5705
04:23:36,660 --> 04:23:39,140
But the graphics look so much better than, like...

5706
04:23:40,640 --> 04:23:41,340
What's happening?

5707
04:23:41,560 --> 04:23:42,280
What is this music?

5708
04:23:46,600 --> 04:23:47,860
Let's wrap it up.

5709
04:23:48,200 --> 04:23:48,340
Let's wrap it up.

5710
04:23:59,570 --> 04:24:00,010
What?

5711
04:24:00,010 --> 04:24:00,810
Oh my god.

5712
04:24:01,250 --> 04:24:01,910
Oh my god.

5713
04:24:01,950 --> 04:24:02,170
Look.

5714
04:24:02,730 --> 04:24:03,530
Our priest.

5715
04:24:03,710 --> 04:24:04,230
Seek your Sam.

5716
04:24:05,210 --> 04:24:05,650
What?

5717
04:24:17,550 --> 04:24:18,230
Oh my god.

5718
04:24:18,250 --> 04:24:18,410
Yeah.

5719
04:24:18,570 --> 04:24:19,450
He's just an old man.

5720
04:24:19,570 --> 04:24:20,430
He can't kick his ass easy.

5721
04:24:23,170 --> 04:24:24,270
Old man fight.

5722
04:24:24,750 --> 04:24:25,510
Oh my god.

5723
04:24:25,570 --> 04:24:27,450
If only this was on top of the bathhouse.

5724
04:24:27,530 --> 04:24:28,070
Can you imagine?

5725
04:24:30,350 --> 04:24:32,090
That would be so awesome.

5726
04:24:32,330 --> 04:24:32,430
Oh.

5727
04:24:32,510 --> 04:24:32,930
That was it?

5728
04:24:33,030 --> 04:24:33,310
Okay.

5729
04:24:44,430 --> 04:24:44,790
I'm sorry.

5730
04:24:50,110 --> 04:24:51,850
I should have gone to the police much earlier.

5731
04:24:53,330 --> 04:24:53,910
I just...

5732
04:24:53,910 --> 04:24:56,390
I had hoped the landlord would repent for what he had done by getting haunted.

5733
04:24:58,630 --> 04:25:00,570
When I knew that Yoko was haunting him.

5734
04:25:00,610 --> 04:25:02,510
I felt that she wanted to get her revenge.

5735
04:25:03,330 --> 04:25:03,810
Yes.

5736
04:25:06,550 --> 04:25:08,830
And that revenge was her only wish.

5737
04:25:10,150 --> 04:25:14,570
So I thought it would be best for everyone involved if things were left to run its course.

5738
04:25:14,970 --> 04:25:16,650
It's been 24 years!

5739
04:25:18,190 --> 04:25:21,950
If he didn't feel bad the first time, why would he feel bad 20 years later?

5740
04:25:24,190 --> 04:25:25,610
I was just an observer of what happened.

5741
04:25:26,970 --> 04:25:28,890
Even the gods told me not to intervene.

5742
04:25:31,590 --> 04:25:32,070
Even the gods told me not to intervene.

5743
04:25:32,070 --> 04:25:32,250
Even the gods told me not to intervene.

5744
04:25:32,250 --> 04:25:33,850
I don't believe that.

5745
04:25:34,930 --> 04:25:36,350
It was what I told myself.

5746
04:25:37,290 --> 04:25:39,490
I was deciding the gods will on my own.

5747
04:25:41,990 --> 04:25:43,010
But I was wrong.

5748
04:25:44,050 --> 04:25:48,030
The gods will was not there.

5749
04:25:48,570 --> 04:25:49,790
Only Yoko's will.

5750
04:25:51,590 --> 04:25:53,510
Yoko didn't really want revenge the most.

5751
04:25:54,550 --> 04:25:58,030
As a mother, Yoko was just deeply concerned about her children.

5752
04:25:58,490 --> 04:25:59,010
Awwww.

5753
04:26:01,190 --> 04:26:02,230
I was just thinking about my children.

5754
04:26:02,230 --> 04:26:05,090
Even after her death, Yoko was trying to protect her children.

5755
04:26:05,310 --> 04:26:06,690
She was a wonderful mother.

5756
04:26:07,930 --> 04:26:09,930
Okay, that's why she spooked me so much?

5757
04:26:11,550 --> 04:26:13,330
Yoko really wanted to see her children.

5758
04:26:13,390 --> 04:26:14,850
She harassed me in the bathtub!

5759
04:26:15,290 --> 04:26:16,340
Elena, thank you.

5760
04:26:19,630 --> 04:26:23,090
You saved Yoko, your mother, and me.

5761
04:26:23,090 --> 04:26:23,910
You saved Yoko, your mother, and me.

5762
04:26:23,910 --> 04:26:24,190
You saved Yoko, your mother, and me.

5763
04:26:24,190 --> 04:26:25,010
You're Yoko?

5764
04:26:25,870 --> 04:26:27,510
Thank you very much.

5765
04:26:28,270 --> 04:26:30,770
Please live on with your mother in your heart.

5766
04:26:31,290 --> 04:26:31,910
Please live on with your mother in your heart.

5767
04:26:36,430 --> 04:26:37,370
What about my brother?

5768
04:26:37,470 --> 04:26:37,550
What about my brother?

5769
04:26:37,550 --> 04:26:37,790
Oh, mother!

5770
04:26:39,990 --> 04:26:40,390
Brother!

5771
04:26:40,710 --> 04:26:41,850
I've always wanted a brother.

5772
04:26:44,550 --> 04:26:45,810
It's all over, isn't it?

5773
04:26:46,810 --> 04:26:47,790
I heard everything from the priest.

5774
04:26:47,910 --> 04:26:49,790
And I came here on my own will to break...

5775
04:26:50,390 --> 04:26:50,790
Break?

5776
04:26:51,670 --> 04:26:52,070
Yoko...

5777
04:26:54,570 --> 04:26:55,550
No, mom's curse.

5778
04:26:56,270 --> 04:26:57,170
No, mom's curse.

5779
04:26:58,250 --> 04:27:01,790
And I thought my mission was to release Ubume into the world.

5780
04:27:02,030 --> 04:27:02,170
And I thought my mission was to release Ubume into the world.

5781
04:27:02,950 --> 04:27:03,670
And I thought my mission was to release Ubume into the world.

5782
04:27:03,690 --> 04:27:06,810
Well, as long as the curse can be broken, I didn't care what would happen in this world.

5783
04:27:06,890 --> 04:27:08,050
Is what I thought at first.

5784
04:27:10,270 --> 04:27:12,170
But I was wrong!

5785
04:27:14,030 --> 04:27:14,750
You're amazing!

5786
04:27:15,230 --> 04:27:17,670
You didn't know anything, but you solved it!

5787
04:27:18,430 --> 04:27:19,350
I don't... okay.

5788
04:27:20,710 --> 04:27:23,450
I'm not used to saying it, but I feel proud that you're my sister.

5789
04:27:24,610 --> 04:27:24,970
Hey!

5790
04:27:26,730 --> 04:27:28,130
What are you going to do from now on?

5791
04:27:28,190 --> 04:27:28,970
Find a job?

5792
04:27:29,350 --> 04:27:29,830
I don't know.

5793
04:27:29,830 --> 04:27:32,870
I live in another village that is a little far from here.

5794
04:27:33,630 --> 04:27:35,890
There's nothing there, but the people are really nice.

5795
04:27:37,090 --> 04:27:38,810
Let me come with you!

5796
04:27:39,390 --> 04:27:41,450
Everyone here is rude and terrible!

5797
04:27:41,870 --> 04:27:43,550
I hope this village burns down!

5798
04:27:44,570 --> 04:27:45,650
Do you want to come live with me?

5799
04:27:46,570 --> 04:27:47,550
Oh, what if you say no?

5800
04:27:48,650 --> 04:27:49,730
You have a decision.

5801
04:27:50,010 --> 04:27:50,530
You have a choice.

5802
04:27:52,030 --> 04:27:53,190
Let's go together then.

5803
04:27:53,390 --> 04:27:55,510
But also, brother, why are you a wanted man?

5804
04:27:56,250 --> 04:27:57,710
Why are you a wanted criminal?

5805
04:27:58,230 --> 04:27:59,810
Could you please explain that to me?

5806
04:27:59,830 --> 04:28:02,250
Before I go live in your house?

5807
04:28:11,990 --> 04:28:14,530
Please explain the signs, brother.

5808
04:28:15,210 --> 04:28:18,710
Can you tell me why you are a wanted criminal?

5809
04:28:19,290 --> 04:28:19,890
Brother.

5810
04:28:20,750 --> 04:28:21,350
Please.

5811
04:28:22,290 --> 04:28:23,450
Okay, bye everybody.

5812
04:28:23,490 --> 04:28:24,450
You can't even wave.

5813
04:28:24,950 --> 04:28:25,570
Oh, mom!

5814
04:28:26,790 --> 04:28:27,690
Oh, mom.

5815
04:28:29,770 --> 04:28:32,250
Oh my god, brother is the slowest driver ever.

5816
04:28:32,870 --> 04:28:33,690
Alright, brother.

5817
04:28:33,910 --> 04:28:34,990
Step on it.

5818
04:28:39,590 --> 04:28:40,070
Wow!

5819
04:28:43,510 --> 04:28:44,710
Bye, you weirdos.

5820
04:28:45,030 --> 04:28:46,410
See you never.

5821
04:28:46,790 --> 04:28:48,870
Oh my god.

5822
04:28:49,230 --> 04:28:50,170
Where is the mom?

5823
04:28:50,510 --> 04:28:50,970
Oh, sorry.

5824
04:28:53,130 --> 04:28:54,550
How do I get rid of these pictures?

5825
04:28:54,810 --> 04:28:55,810
How do I get rid of this?

5826
04:28:57,130 --> 04:29:00,630
How do I get rid of this?

5827
04:29:00,630 --> 04:29:00,810
How do I get rid of this?

5828
04:29:03,790 --> 04:29:04,510
Oh, my god.

5829
04:29:04,510 --> 04:29:05,890
I can't say...

5830
04:29:07,690 --> 04:29:08,490
Oh, gosh.

5831
04:29:08,850 --> 04:29:09,570
Oh, god.

5832
04:29:09,710 --> 04:29:16,530
There we

5833
04:29:19,630 --> 04:29:19,810
go.

5834
04:29:22,050 --> 04:29:22,850
They're related.

5835
04:29:23,910 --> 04:29:24,430
Oh,

5836
04:29:28,480 --> 04:29:28,820
gosh.

5837
04:29:30,280 --> 04:29:31,220
Don't look at my...

5838
04:29:31,220 --> 04:29:33,160
I don't even know what's in my recommended...

5839
04:29:33,160 --> 04:29:40,850
You're gonna see airport and cozy jazz music, okay?

5840
04:29:40,930 --> 04:29:42,810
Please, stop judging me.

5841
04:29:46,110 --> 04:29:51,490
This is why I have multiple, multiple, what's it called, YouTubes.

5842
04:29:52,610 --> 04:29:53,590
Anyway, woo!

5843
04:29:56,320 --> 04:29:57,460
That was fun!

5844
04:29:57,860 --> 04:29:59,560
That was good.

5845
04:30:01,320 --> 04:30:03,180
I liked the old man fight.

5846
04:30:03,320 --> 04:30:04,080
That was good.

5847
04:30:04,940 --> 04:30:07,000
Give me a second, I might move us over.

5848
04:30:08,280 --> 04:30:08,680
Here.

5849
04:30:11,340 --> 04:30:12,020
There we go.

5850
04:30:15,020 --> 04:30:17,880
Give me a second also, let me...

5851
04:30:20,580 --> 04:30:21,380
Let's do...

5852
04:30:23,700 --> 04:30:25,740
I don't talk for too long, because I'm tired.

5853
04:30:31,760 --> 04:30:34,000
But I just don't want to talk in the void.

5854
04:30:38,520 --> 04:30:38,920
Woo!

5855
04:30:39,320 --> 04:30:40,080
That was fun!

5856
04:30:40,260 --> 04:30:43,540
I hope you guys enjoyed the stream.

5857
04:30:47,980 --> 04:30:50,020
There was something I was gonna say and I don't remember what.

5858
04:30:53,480 --> 04:30:55,240
I do plan on streaming tomorrow.

5859
04:30:58,800 --> 04:31:01,120
Sorry, no schedule.

5860
04:31:02,000 --> 04:31:03,960
I don't think I'll be able to stream on Saturday.

5861
04:31:04,120 --> 04:31:05,540
Actually, maybe early Saturday.

5862
04:31:06,940 --> 04:31:07,420
Mmm...

5863
04:31:07,420 --> 04:31:10,040
I think I'll move Metal Gear to Sunday though.

5864
04:31:10,140 --> 04:31:11,080
Gabriel, thanks for the gift!

5865
04:31:11,580 --> 04:31:13,020
I'm tri-princess, thank you!

5866
04:31:13,680 --> 04:31:14,640
Happy birthday!

5867
04:31:14,820 --> 04:31:15,760
Thanks, it's fun!

5868
04:31:16,140 --> 04:31:16,920
Thank you!

5869
04:31:19,020 --> 04:31:20,340
Your menu's outdated.

5870
04:31:20,680 --> 04:31:21,960
Um, actually it's not.

5871
04:31:22,080 --> 04:31:24,140
Because that's the last episode of the podcast.

5872
04:31:24,940 --> 04:31:25,420
So...

5873
04:31:27,680 --> 04:31:28,880
It's the only thing...

5874
04:31:28,880 --> 04:31:31,560
Actually, let me add my 3.0, huh?

5875
04:31:32,320 --> 04:31:33,820
Let me at least add that too.

5876
04:31:34,980 --> 04:31:35,520
Let's see.

5877
04:31:35,520 --> 04:31:35,980
Let's see...

5878
04:31:39,320 --> 04:31:40,280
There we go.

5879
04:31:40,540 --> 04:31:42,280
I have two things on the menu.

5880
04:31:43,080 --> 04:31:43,920
That and that.

5881
04:31:46,960 --> 04:31:47,360
Uh...

5882
04:31:50,560 --> 04:31:51,740
Welcome to Mammoth Ship!

5883
04:31:51,840 --> 04:31:52,840
I'm sorry if I said your name wrong.

5884
04:31:53,060 --> 04:31:53,780
Sorry, thank you.

5885
04:31:56,860 --> 04:31:57,560
Thank you, thank you.

5886
04:31:59,700 --> 04:32:00,100
Um...

5887
04:32:04,190 --> 04:32:05,570
Can't wait to see you at Bolt Mint!

5888
04:32:05,750 --> 04:32:05,990
Yeah!

5889
04:32:06,430 --> 04:32:07,210
I'll be...

5890
04:32:08,230 --> 04:32:09,590
I'll be able to stream something earlier in the day.

5891
04:32:09,710 --> 04:32:11,050
And then perform that night.

5892
04:32:11,290 --> 04:32:11,630
So...

5893
04:32:11,630 --> 04:32:14,730
I should be able to stream Saturday as well.

5894
04:32:14,850 --> 04:32:17,170
And then Sunday will be Metal Gear.

5895
04:32:19,370 --> 04:32:20,450
Star Sticks!

5896
04:32:20,530 --> 04:32:21,570
Welcome to Mammoth Ship!

5897
04:32:21,770 --> 04:32:22,690
Thank you!

5898
04:32:23,810 --> 04:32:24,410
Yeah...

5899
04:32:26,270 --> 04:32:28,010
It's Vmuse next weekend.

5900
04:32:28,230 --> 04:32:28,750
Yes!

5901
04:32:29,450 --> 04:32:31,670
So, concert back-to-back weekend.

5902
04:32:34,410 --> 04:32:35,010
And...

5903
04:32:35,010 --> 04:32:36,930
Take care of your voice after the busy day.

5904
04:32:37,090 --> 04:32:37,590
Thank you!

5905
04:32:39,430 --> 04:32:39,990
Uh...

5906
04:32:47,550 --> 04:32:49,810
Sorry, my brain is all tired now.

5907
04:32:50,310 --> 04:32:52,330
I wish I could show you guys that...

5908
04:32:52,330 --> 04:32:54,010
That Lion King trailer.

5909
04:32:54,570 --> 04:32:56,670
But I'm afraid Disney will bonk me.

5910
04:32:56,950 --> 04:32:58,230
And I can't...

5911
04:32:59,210 --> 04:33:00,330
I can't...

5912
04:33:00,330 --> 04:33:02,110
I can't afford that.

5913
04:33:03,570 --> 04:33:06,130
I can't afford another strike on my channel.

5914
04:33:06,130 --> 04:33:08,130
Thank you!

5915
04:33:08,810 --> 04:33:09,070
Thank you!

5916
04:33:09,070 --> 04:33:09,530
Are you watching?

5917
04:33:09,950 --> 04:33:11,530
Dan the Dan.

5918
04:33:11,750 --> 04:33:12,710
It's so spooky.

5919
04:33:14,170 --> 04:33:15,050
What's that?

5920
04:33:20,720 --> 04:33:21,500
Oh!

5921
04:33:21,760 --> 04:33:23,700
I saw...

5922
04:33:23,700 --> 04:33:25,480
The... Actually...

5923
04:33:25,480 --> 04:33:28,320
The Creepy Nuts song was...

5924
04:33:28,320 --> 04:33:30,740
Was recommended to me.

5925
04:33:31,540 --> 04:33:33,460
But I haven't watched...

5926
04:33:33,460 --> 04:33:34,920
I didn't know anything about it.

5927
04:33:38,670 --> 04:33:40,710
I don't know anything about it.

5928
04:33:41,650 --> 04:33:41,750
Is it scary?

5929
04:33:42,510 --> 04:33:43,870
Is it actually creepy?

5930
04:33:44,350 --> 04:33:45,490
Is it actually spooky?

5931
04:33:46,750 --> 04:33:47,410
Hmm...

5932
04:33:48,530 --> 04:33:49,890
So excited for the concert.

5933
04:33:49,970 --> 04:33:51,130
Thank you, Tony!

5934
04:33:52,190 --> 04:33:53,310
Thank you!

5935
04:33:54,030 --> 04:33:56,410
It's spooky cool.

5936
04:33:57,690 --> 04:33:58,350
Hmm...

5937
04:33:58,350 --> 04:33:59,250
It's crazy.

5938
04:33:59,530 --> 04:34:00,210
It's wacky.

5939
04:34:00,530 --> 04:34:01,190
Hmm...

5940
04:34:01,190 --> 04:34:02,730
I look into it.

5941
04:34:03,070 --> 04:34:06,610
I've been slowly, slowly, slowly getting through...

5942
04:34:07,500 --> 04:34:08,370
Girls Band Cry.

5943
04:34:08,370 --> 04:34:10,270
I'm like on episode 4.

5944
04:34:11,730 --> 04:34:12,670
Slowly, slowly.

5945
04:34:14,170 --> 04:34:15,170
When I can.

5946
04:34:15,530 --> 04:34:16,350
When I can.

5947
04:34:16,470 --> 04:34:17,030
So...

5948
04:34:18,410 --> 04:34:19,730
I've been watching that.

5949
04:34:22,830 --> 04:34:23,430
I've been watching that.

5950
04:34:23,430 --> 04:34:24,390
Especially because I saw...

5951
04:34:24,390 --> 04:34:26,050
You know, I saw them at Anisama.

5952
04:34:28,130 --> 04:34:28,690
So...

5953
04:34:29,330 --> 04:34:29,890
So...

5954
04:34:29,890 --> 04:34:30,890
Um...

5955
04:34:30,890 --> 04:34:33,370
And then I also went to like a...

5956
04:34:34,190 --> 04:34:35,810
A thing they had at...

5957
04:34:37,710 --> 04:34:38,270
Laforet.

5958
04:34:38,370 --> 04:34:39,350
No, sorry.

5959
04:34:39,470 --> 04:34:39,650
Not...

5960
04:34:39,650 --> 04:34:40,030
Atore.

5961
04:34:41,990 --> 04:34:43,850
Have fun and come back for live entertainment.

5962
04:34:43,910 --> 04:34:44,750
Thank you!

5963
04:34:50,400 --> 04:34:52,300
Has she held the yogurt that makes you cry?

5964
04:34:52,860 --> 04:34:53,300
Yes.

5965
04:34:54,780 --> 04:34:56,940
Yes, she has held the yogurt that makes you cry.

5966
04:34:58,120 --> 04:34:58,560
Yes, she has held the yogurt that makes you cry.

5967
04:34:59,780 --> 04:35:01,640
I don't even know if it's airing this season.

5968
04:35:02,120 --> 04:35:02,460
I...

5969
04:35:04,020 --> 04:35:04,680
Is it...

5970
04:35:04,680 --> 04:35:07,140
Is ReZero this season?

5971
04:35:08,080 --> 04:35:09,140
Or am I crazy?

5972
04:35:10,600 --> 04:35:12,160
Is ReZero this season?

5973
04:35:15,060 --> 04:35:15,540
Yes.

5974
04:35:15,760 --> 04:35:16,980
Yeah, I gotta start that.

5975
04:35:17,200 --> 04:35:18,160
First episode just aired.

5976
04:35:19,420 --> 04:35:21,720
If it wasn't so late, I would watch it.

5977
04:35:22,060 --> 04:35:22,240
If it wasn't so late, I would watch it.

5978
04:35:22,540 --> 04:35:23,020
If it wasn't so late, I would watch it.

5979
04:35:26,550 --> 04:35:27,530
Oh, okay.

5980
04:35:27,690 --> 04:35:28,510
Aired yesterday.

5981
04:35:28,870 --> 04:35:30,190
It's an hour and a half!

5982
04:35:33,030 --> 04:35:33,990
Oh, Lizumaki.

5983
04:35:34,450 --> 04:35:37,990
Can't wait for you to get through my feed during the last few episodes with Absolute Crazy.

5984
04:35:38,010 --> 04:35:38,570
It's so wild.

5985
04:35:38,570 --> 04:35:40,290
Before Girls Band cry.

5986
04:35:42,750 --> 04:35:44,330
Okay, I have to watch.

5987
04:35:45,170 --> 04:35:45,910
You know what?

5988
04:35:45,970 --> 04:35:46,170
Good.

5989
04:35:46,370 --> 04:35:48,130
Good thing they made it in an hour and a half.

5990
04:35:48,330 --> 04:35:49,270
Because they've been...

5991
04:35:49,930 --> 04:35:51,850
ReZero's been gone for so long!

5992
04:35:52,470 --> 04:35:53,210
Like, please!

5993
04:35:55,550 --> 04:35:56,870
At least they gave us that.

5994
04:36:00,890 --> 04:36:02,490
Over the Garden Wall when?

5995
04:36:02,630 --> 04:36:05,050
Probably closer to Halloween.

5996
04:36:06,070 --> 04:36:06,670
Even though...

5997
04:36:06,670 --> 04:36:08,370
Did you guys see that there was going to be...

5998
04:36:08,570 --> 04:36:10,230
Did you see David Hayter tweet?

5999
04:36:10,610 --> 04:36:12,270
That is so vague.

6000
04:36:12,590 --> 04:36:13,170
I don't know.

6001
04:36:14,130 --> 04:36:15,830
I have seen him tweet before, yeah?

6002
04:36:17,930 --> 04:36:22,470
There's like an Over the Garden Wall 10th anniversary thing that they're doing.

6003
04:36:22,510 --> 04:36:24,490
But they're doing it on November 2nd.

6004
04:36:24,810 --> 04:36:25,890
And I'm like...

6005
04:36:26,810 --> 04:36:27,250
What?

6006
04:36:27,390 --> 04:36:27,590
Why?

6007
04:36:31,090 --> 04:36:33,370
Why are you doing it on November 2nd?

6008
04:36:33,490 --> 04:36:35,030
When it's a...

6009
04:36:35,930 --> 04:36:37,430
When it's a Halloween...

6010
04:36:38,570 --> 04:36:39,710
It takes place on a Halloween night!

6011
04:36:43,030 --> 04:36:43,470
So...

6012
04:36:44,190 --> 04:36:46,050
Let me go see David Hayter.

6013
04:36:46,190 --> 04:36:47,610
I don't know what you guys are talking about.

6014
04:36:49,650 --> 04:36:50,530
David Hayter...

6015
04:36:56,700 --> 04:36:58,040
He was in the booth today.

6016
04:36:58,300 --> 04:36:59,080
Is that the one?

6017
04:37:01,740 --> 04:37:03,960
Playing a role I've not played since...

6018
04:37:08,590 --> 04:37:09,590
What does that mean?

6019
04:37:14,870 --> 04:37:15,790
What does that mean?

6020
04:37:17,730 --> 04:37:18,850
New Guyver?

6021
04:37:19,270 --> 04:37:20,630
New Guyver?

6022
04:37:21,150 --> 04:37:21,830
New Guyver?

6023
04:37:25,570 --> 04:37:27,510
I don't think it's new lines for Delta.

6024
04:37:27,810 --> 04:37:29,590
I don't think it's new lines for Delta.

6025
04:37:29,810 --> 04:37:31,270
Unless it's like...

6026
04:37:32,290 --> 04:37:35,430
Unless it's like stuff for...

6027
04:37:35,430 --> 04:37:35,630
Unless it's like stuff for...

6028
04:37:35,630 --> 04:37:36,550
But nobody...

6029
04:37:36,550 --> 04:37:38,370
Like controls and stuff.

6030
04:37:45,570 --> 04:37:47,190
Guyver would be bonkers.

6031
04:37:47,890 --> 04:37:48,930
Oh my gosh.

6032
04:37:49,130 --> 04:37:51,430
Maddie and I just wouldn't shut up about Guyver.

6033
04:37:51,430 --> 04:37:53,690
At MGS Con.

6034
04:37:53,890 --> 04:37:54,690
Because like...

6035
04:37:55,210 --> 04:37:57,070
We were just saying how...

6036
04:37:57,070 --> 04:37:59,910
You know... I mean David Hayter is still an attractive guy.

6037
04:38:00,110 --> 04:38:00,630
But like...

6038
04:38:00,630 --> 04:38:02,850
Back then even he was so...

6039
04:38:02,850 --> 04:38:04,890
He was a Hollywood heartthrob.

6040
04:38:04,970 --> 04:38:06,630
He was so cute.

6041
04:38:07,790 --> 04:38:09,090
He was so...

6042
04:38:09,090 --> 04:38:10,990
So like... Oh my god.

6043
04:38:11,590 --> 04:38:13,170
He could have been up there with like...

6044
04:38:13,170 --> 04:38:14,150
Leonardo DiCaprio.

6045
04:38:14,150 --> 04:38:14,170
Leonardo DiCaprio.

6046
04:38:18,270 --> 04:38:18,690
Okay.

6047
04:38:19,370 --> 04:38:20,150
I'm gonna go.

6048
04:38:20,730 --> 04:38:22,190
Because it's almost been five hours.

6049
04:38:22,250 --> 04:38:24,450
And that means I've been streaming for like...

6050
04:38:24,450 --> 04:38:26,250
Well I've been on stream.

6051
04:38:26,950 --> 04:38:27,790
For like...

6052
04:38:29,510 --> 04:38:30,630
Like eight hours today.

6053
04:38:30,730 --> 04:38:31,450
So I'm tired.

6054
04:38:32,990 --> 04:38:34,970
Probably will take it easy the next two days.

6055
04:38:34,990 --> 04:38:37,790
So I can also get some rest from my trip.

6056
04:38:38,630 --> 04:38:39,890
And also for the concert.

6057
04:38:40,110 --> 04:38:40,530
So...

6058
04:38:42,370 --> 04:38:43,830
I'm still not sure what I'll do tomorrow.

6059
04:38:44,150 --> 04:38:44,790
But I'll figure it out.

6060
04:38:47,390 --> 04:38:48,190
Satisfactory playthrough.

6061
04:38:48,830 --> 04:38:49,230
Win.

6062
04:38:49,470 --> 04:38:49,650
What?

6063
04:38:51,490 --> 04:38:51,890
Oh.

6064
04:38:52,350 --> 04:38:52,750
Satisfactory?

6065
04:38:52,870 --> 04:38:53,350
No, no.

6066
04:38:53,390 --> 04:38:54,250
Not my type of game.

6067
04:38:56,490 --> 04:38:56,890
Um...

6068
04:38:57,830 --> 04:38:59,150
Not really my type of game.

6069
04:38:59,330 --> 04:39:00,630
I don't know.

6070
04:39:00,670 --> 04:39:01,010
We'll see.

6071
04:39:01,050 --> 04:39:01,590
Maybe someday.

6072
04:39:01,730 --> 04:39:02,050
I don't know.

6073
04:39:02,230 --> 04:39:02,630
But...

6074
04:39:03,110 --> 04:39:04,250
Not anytime soon.

6075
04:39:06,010 --> 04:39:06,410
Yeah.

6076
04:39:06,710 --> 04:39:07,990
Not anytime soon.

6077
04:39:09,010 --> 04:39:09,410
Um...

6078
04:39:09,410 --> 04:39:11,190
I do have like a lot of spooky games.

6079
04:39:11,290 --> 04:39:12,790
That I do want to do this month though.

6080
04:39:14,150 --> 04:39:14,570
So...

6081
04:39:14,570 --> 04:39:16,810
Sorry if spooky games are not your thing.

6082
04:39:16,970 --> 04:39:17,270
But...

6083
04:39:17,270 --> 04:39:19,910
Spooky games are on the menu baby.

6084
04:39:21,930 --> 04:39:22,230
So...

6085
04:39:22,230 --> 04:39:23,450
Gonna be probably doing...

6086
04:39:23,450 --> 04:39:26,790
A good bit of spooky games.

6087
04:39:27,130 --> 04:39:29,290
I have another collab next week.

6088
04:39:29,430 --> 04:39:30,730
A spooky game collab.

6089
04:39:31,510 --> 04:39:32,110
So...

6090
04:39:33,270 --> 04:39:33,870
