Okay, we're fine.

106
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,100
Everything's fine.

Okay.

112
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,660
I don't like the songs.

113
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,980
What if I step back and shoot at them?

114
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,440
Okay, you can do that.

115
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:54,740
Yeah.

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,700

Okay, other people tried crawling through here, but they weren't as good as me.

152
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,830
Why are they giant spiders?

153
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,910
Oh my god.

154
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,030

Okay.

178
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,620
It's a good workout.

179
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,600
It is, it is.

180
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,640
Don't do it.

Oh, my gosh, I'm right!

Someone exploded, but I think actually that was okay.

201
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,840
There's some goo happening.

202
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,640
I don't know if they're even coming from that side anymore.

203
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,480
I don't know if they're coming at all anymore.

204
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,780
Wait, wait, wait.

He got him.

211
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,260
Unlimited power!

212
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,360
Keep cranking it!

213
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:20,500
Oh!

214
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,540
Interesting.

215
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:36,260
Once again, you just gotta respect, like, the architects who made this giant bronze lion that spews flames forward.

216
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,660
But also, like, what hindsight do you need to feel that you should make this?

217
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,180
Yes!

218
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,560
Yeah, it worked!

219
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,880
We did it!

220
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,800
We survived the zombie attack.

221
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,940
Wait, did they... Oh, they left a lot of loot, though.

222
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,340
Come on.

223
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:56,700
Hey!

224
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,360
My inventory is so very full.

225
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,180
Me too!

226
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,560
Die, zombie!

227
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Don't give me that!

228
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,970
Just gotta make sure.

229
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,610
Yeah, yeah, of course.

230
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:16,910
Okay.

231
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,970
We go through?

232
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:27,310
open oh oh oh i thought some oh okay hi

233
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:55,120

234
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,260
Just once I like to find a place where it would warm water, you know?

235
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,680
I have trauma from like Kingdom Hearts of water levels.

236
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,080
Oh, I've never played Kingdom Hearts.

237
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,840
Really?

238
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,160
I think you like it.

239
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,420
I just can't get over these anime characters.

240
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,560
And then suddenly Mickey Mouse shows up.

241
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,820
That's the best part!

242
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,150
Just go onward?

243
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,730
There's a fish somewhere.

244
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,670
Yeah, that guy's around.

245
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,530
What are the water levels in Kingdom Hearts?

246
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,530
It's a little mermaid.

247
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,310
Of course, of course.

248
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,110
Of course the little mermaid would be there.

249
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:43,830
Of course.

250
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,630
Uh-oh, I think we're...

251
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,690
Is Sebastian there too?

252
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,650
Leon.

253
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,470
Yeah, he's there.

254
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,070
He sings and, you know...

255
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,910
Where'd you go?

256
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:55,170
Hurry it up.

257
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,490
I love us.

258
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,250
This way.

259
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,340
Wait.

260
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,660
If you do it for long enough, does Leon start shouting too?

261
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,100
I guess so.

262
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:13,420
Maybe.

263
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,600
It's this thing right here.

264
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:16,680
Oh, this?

265
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,140
Try it.

266
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:17,780
Try it.

267
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,040
Hey.

269
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,160
Over here.

270
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:23,980
Over here.

271
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,460
Over here.

272
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,300

273
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,160
Yes!

274
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,800
Oh, my gosh.

275
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,840
It's so impatient.

276
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,840
Oh, my God.

277
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,880
Oh, I'm taking the high road.

278
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,360
You always do.

279
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,640
Oh, am I gonna have to fight the fish down here?

280
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,680
No, they wouldn't make you do that alone.

281
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,140
Ooh.

282
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,020
Oh my gosh.

283
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,040
I hear a zombie like freaking out in my ear.

284
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,580
Oh.

285
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:56,820

286
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,000
Oh my god, he was crawling at me while I'm crawling.

287
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,340
That was so scary.

288
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,400

I got no crank to crank.

331
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,300
Uh, I'm looking for cranks.

332
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
I've got a crank.

333
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,090
I'm cranking it.

334
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,150
Oh, geez.

335
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:55,930

You!

341
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:02,790
Is it working?

342
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,650
How?

343
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,470
I don't know what I'm cranking.

344
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,990
You're doing the spikes.

345
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,810
But they're going faster.

346
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,070
Oh, am I supposed to stop?

347
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:12,750
Crank's over here.

348
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:13,170
Oh.

349
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:14,590
Wait.

350
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,390
No, it was good.

351
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:15,910
It was good.

352
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:16,510
Oh, what?

353
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,050
Don't crank it anymore.

354
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,770
Okay, okay, okay.

355
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,370
Where do I go?

356
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,560
Oh, both are closed.

357
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,820
Do I need to find it?

358
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,560
Oh gosh, they're all dying to the saws.

359
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,240
I could hear them just be like...

360
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,220
They're like crawling through.

361
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,360
Am I supposed to go up here?

362
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,320
Oh, yeah, I am.

363
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,960
Okay, I thought so, but I didn't get a prompt at first.

364
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh, goodness.

365
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,280
Oh, goodness.

366
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,240
Look at that good...

367
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:03,900
Oh!

368
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,700
Are you okay?

369
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,060
Yeah, I'm okay.

370
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,220
Oh my gosh!

371
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,380
I don't think I'm hitting him at all.

372
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,120
Oh, there he is.

373
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,540
Wait, I have a sniper.

374
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

375
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,140
Oh, I needed to reload.

376
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
Wait, did I die?

377
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,720
No, no, no, I'm alive.

378
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:25,580
Somehow.

379
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,580
I got one guy.

380
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,940
Oh, I needed to crank it, I'm so sorry!

381
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,320
No!

382
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:34,820
Ah!

383
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:35,960
Help me!

384
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,060
I've died.

385
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,080
You did?

386
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,320
Wait, maybe.

387
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,380
No!

388
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,640
I think I'm dying.

389
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,440
I killed him.

390
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,780
Wait, can I live?

391
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,460
Oh, I don't know.

392
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,980
I don't know how to get over to you.

393
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,620
I'm protecting you.

394
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,560
I'm protecting you.

395
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,320
They're like throwing poo at you.

396
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:08,880
Oh, I can get up.

397
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,180
Oh, I can get up.

398
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,260
Yay!

399
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,920
So maybe I need to do something.

400
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,040
It shows that I need to get over there, but I don't know how.

401
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,320
Oh, I just don't want to go through the...

402
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,740
Through the saws again.

403
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,440
I think you're down!

404
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,360
I think you got...

405
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:44,960
I'm down!

406
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,540
You got hit by the...

407
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,680
They flung something at you.

408
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,780
They threw a rock at me?

409
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,980
Oh, no.

410
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,340
Oh, no!

411
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,760
Oh, he spit on me?

412
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,860
Where was the checkpoint?

413
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,600
Guess what?

414
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,880
There's no crank here.

415
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,260
I'm going to look for it.

416
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,920
Oh, I need to look for the crank.

417
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
There's no guarantee it's even in here.

418
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,020
True.

419
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,440
It was me.

420
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,760
No, I think because there was...

421
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
Oh, goodness.

422
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,360
There was...

423
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,580
I saw it on the other side of the thing from you, though.

424
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,720
Oh, wait, did he give me something?

425
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,040
Yeah, no, I can't.

426
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,460
All right.

427
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,780
More cranking.

428
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,480
Got you.

429
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,680
I'll protect you.

430
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,920
Just be careful of the spikes.

431
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,080
Wait.

432
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,420
Oh, I think I need to...

433
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,700
Do I need to go back?

434
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,500
Ow, stop spinning.

435
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,800
I hate them.

436
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,460
If you get far enough, well, I guess...

437
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,700
I wonder if I can take them down from here.

438
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:08,220
I'll try to check over there.

439
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:08,920
Maybe.

440
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,100
Oh, I forgot.

441
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,500
I needed to reload again.

442
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,080
Did that take care of them?

443
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,600
Reunite with your partner.

444
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,160
Oh, reunite.

445
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,220
Wait, is it open?

446
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,260
What am I there?

447
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,280
Wait,

448
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,960
but it's a trap beneath the skull.

449
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,340
Oh, watch out, watch out.

450
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,340
If you go to the spikes, I'll crank it.

451
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,220
I'll crank it!

452
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,820
Oh, it doesn't spike.

453
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,720
Okay, yeah, go past.

454
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:39,440
Go past.

455
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,280
Okay, there we go.

456
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,520
Thank you.

457
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,300
Thank

458
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:53,600
you.

459
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,840
They're really just flinging these rocks at you, though.

460
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,320
It's like monkeys throwing poo.

461
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,060
I know.

462
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,280
My mom had a monkey when she was a kid.

463
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
And it would throw poo at her.

464
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,460
A monkey?

465
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,160
Yeah.

466
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,740
A pet monkey?

467
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,660
Yeah, yeah.

468
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,180
My grandpa brought it home one day.

469
00:32:12,840 --> 00:33:09,900

Thank you for not.

473
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,300
I was real close.

474
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,680
Okay, I got the crank.

475
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,200
Okay.

476
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,920
I just make it through the saws.

477
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,460
I believe in you.

478
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,340
Oh, gosh.

479
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,580
Yeah.

480
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,400
Okay.

481
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,580
I just crawl very slowly.

482
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:12,820
Uh-huh.

483
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,120
Wait, did you?

484
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,800
I won't stand up.

485
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,680
Wait, did you crank it?

486
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,640
I'm about to- No!

487
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,820
No, no, no!

488
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,020
Zombie?

489
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,100
No, no, no!

490
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,540
No, no!

491
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,100
Please, I just got the crank!

492
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,120
Oh, was it a zombie?

493
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,300
Oh my gosh.

494
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,240
Yes, I might live, though.

495
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,980
Wait, okay, I think I need to cover for you then.

496
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,520
No, I think it was just one.

497
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,760
Eat the herb.

498
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:45,540
Eat the herb.

499
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,650
I'm struggling over here.

500
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,050
I know, I can tell.

501
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,950
Yay!

502
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,450
Okay, okay, good, good.

503
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,930
Wait, what side am I on?

504
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,170
I'm on the right side!

505
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:04,470
Oh my gosh!

506
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,710
Our troubles are over.

507
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:08,510
They are?

508
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,910
I'm cranking it.

509
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:13,780
Yes!

510
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,480
Your gate is open!

511
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:15,940
Yippee!

512
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,020
Thank you!

513
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,120
I think we're here together.

514
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,880
Now I crank it.

515
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,340
Watch out!

516
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,220
Watch out?

517
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
Oh, was there a guy behind me?

518
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,300
Got you.

519
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:33,980
Thank you.

520
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,120
Hi, stranger.

521
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,360
Oh, I'm going to take your loot, though.

522
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:39,640
Oh, yeah.

523
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,000
Come on.

524
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:40,720
Let's keep moving.

525
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,260
You should.

526
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,020
Sick these kind of things.

527
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,620
Oh, I can take that.

528
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:43,840
Cool.

529
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,740
Nice.

530
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,500
Nice.

531
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,020
Finally.

532
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,460
Heleta!

533
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,720
Heleta!

534
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,440
Uh-oh.

535
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,140
It was a trap!

536
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,100
That was something.

537
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,880
We got bad boozled.

538
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,960
Ooh, invented this.

539
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,600
I know, right?

540
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,920
The Caesar?

541
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,560
Beware the odds of March.

542
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,800
Welcome to the center of the earth.

543
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,420

547
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,590
This is the only gun I like.

548
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:05,310
Oh, they're right behind you.

549
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,670
Oh, they can jump.

550
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,570
Why do you have armor?

551
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,450
Oh, nice.

552
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,930
I didn't go back to conserving ammo.

553
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:20,550
Oh, no!

554
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,830
They are so strong now.

555
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,530
This medieval armor should not be this powerful.

556
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,390
I know.

557
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,420
Elder Scrolls moment Yeah He's crying underground caves Who built this?

558
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,860
Why did they build it with no bridges?

559
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,580
Here's a bridge?

560
00:37:49,000 --> 00:38:00,580
We're not going to let Simmons get away with all this Good I won't rest until he's paid for what he did to Deborah We had Debbie That was her name Yeah, Deb Oh, our sister Deborah You're a skinny guy Ah!

00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:08,370

562
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,410
They got the armor.

563
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:10,570
I know.

564
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,300

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,480

00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,100
Oh my gosh.

567
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,140
You're moving!

568
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,060
They don't give up.

569
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,580
I'm trying to...

570
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:28,940
They don't.

571
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,520
Why can't I pick up this?

572
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,880
Come on, please.

573
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:32,880
Let me pick it up.

574
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,760
I think so.

575
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,720
I'm gonna start using...

576
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,680
Oh no!

577
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,600
It's this guy!

578
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,400
Oh no.

579
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,220
I'm gonna use a grenade!

580
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,160
It worked!

581
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,360
New grenade power.

582
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,800
Now I can pick up the ammo.

583
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,930
Oh my gosh!

584
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:58,990
I'm gonna use a grenade!

585
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,550
I don't think it hurts us, so I think we're okay.

586
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,350
Okay.

587
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,650
Do we just... Oh, I'm gonna use a grenade!

588
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:13,330
Oh no.

589
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,050
No I'm not.

590
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:21,760
Hey!

591
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,300
Oh shoot!

592
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:22,680
Hey!

593
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,020
God!

594
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,920
Oh my god!

595
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,060
I didn't punch you hard enough.

596
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,840
I think... Oh, I was gonna...

597
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,720
What?

598
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,000
What is it to take the meds?

599
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
For me, it's the bumper.

600
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,620
Bumper.

601
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,180
I don't know what it is for you.

602
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm sorry.

603
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,420
It's one, I think.

604
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,820
Welcome to the center of the earth.

605
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,780
I think I was onto something, though.

606
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,620
I know, right?

607
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,720
It's kind of awful.

608
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
Like a MOBA.

609
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,160
MOBA controls.

610
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,220
I'm onto something, though, with the...

611
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,920
With the...

612
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
Grenade though.

613
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,520
Yeah, yeah.

614
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,820
Grenades are the way.

615
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,980
Grenades are the way.

616
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,080
Oh, that guy.

617
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,680
They just started coming out of...

618
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,500
Start coming out of nowhere all of a sudden.

619
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:36,740
I know.

620
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,120
Somebody up there?

621
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:41,460
Yep.

622
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:42,600
Ugly.

623
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,500
Super ugly.

624
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,340
More, more!

625
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,400
They don't stop coming!

626
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,380
They don't stop coming!

627
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,980
They don't stop coming.

628
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,060
They don't stop coming.

629
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,560
I think we could just... I think we just got to go for it.

630
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,620
Maybe they'll just keep coming.

631
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,760
We could run.

632
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:05,820
Yeah, isn't that like part of Resident Evil is sometimes you don't have to kill all the guys?

633
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,400
That's true.

634
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,080
You just run for it.

635
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:08,460
Yeah.

636
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,510
If you crank it, I'll cover you.

637
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,290
I promise you.

638
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,690
We're not gonna let Simmons get away with all this.

639
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,230
He is pretty fast.

640
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:21,630
Oh my gosh.

641
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,750
I said I would cover you, but I got...

642
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,230
We run?

643
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,770
Yeah, let's run.

644
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,750
Okay.

645
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:34,590
Oh, it's...

646
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,470
Where is he?

647
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:36,730
Oh, there he is.

648
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:37,710
The guy that screams.

649
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:39,650
Where?

650
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:42,950
He was...

651
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,570
It's close.

652
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,110
I'm going.

653
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,530
I'm running.

654
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,150
Okay, I'll run after you.

655
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,210
Oh, they're all behind you.

656
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:53,890
I know!

657
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:54,850
Oh my god!

658
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,310
Okay, okay, I'm following you.

659
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,990
I think this is the guy that cries.

660
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,190
Oh my god.

661
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,150
Oh no!

662
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:07,430
Yeah!

663
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:09,150
Do you keep running?

664
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,470
Uh, baby!

665
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,950
Wait, I don't remember which way.

666
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,010
This way, this way.

667
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,580
Oh, I'm out.

668
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,080
Oh gosh.

669
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,120
Oh yeah, he's scared.

670
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
He's crybaby.

671
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:21,980
Maybe we could just follow him.

672
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:22,560
Ah!

673
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,060
Oh!

674
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,500
I got you!

675
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,280
That was so...

676
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,160
Uh-oh.

677
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,160
Uh-oh.

678
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:29,920
I got grenades.

679
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,140
Be careful.

680
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,580
We're going down.

681
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,820
Guy does have armor.

682
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,280
I'm going to shoot him in the butt.

683
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:38,500
Yeah.

684
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,240
Get him in the butt.

685
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:40,980
Get him in the butt.

686
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,540
They don't stop coming.

687
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:48,840
Can I drop my ammo that I don't want?

688
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,820
I think you can actually.

689
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:51,200
You can.

690
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:52,500
Yeah.

691
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,000
Nice.

692
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
Wait, he left a big...

693
00:42:59,440 --> 00:42:59,440
There's a treasure!

694
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,660
Yeah, he left a...

695
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,020
No!

696
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,080
That's so evil!

697
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,440
Are you evil?

698
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,380
We can't?

699
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,600
We can't get it!

700
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,600
They're still coming, though.

701
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,680
I think we just gotta keep going.

702
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,540
There will be more treasure.

703
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,180
Yeah.

704
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,240
I was so lame.

705
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,600
I know.

706
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,000
Oh!

707
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:19,920
Oh!

708
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,380
He's gonna scream, though.

709
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,140
He's gonna scream.

710
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,460
I'm gonna scream.

711
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,940
Oh, but he'll give us treasure.

712
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:34,800
Oh.

713
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,200
Where are we going?

714
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:42,480
I'm going.

715
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,360
Wait, there's a big guy.

716
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,720
There's a big guy over there.

717
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,340
Oh, there's

718
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,190
so many guys.

719
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,070
All of a sudden.

720
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,010
Use a grenade.

721
00:43:57,810 --> 00:43:58,210
Oh my gosh.

722
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:58,630
Whoa!

723
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:01,810
Big guy here.

724
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:02,670
Big guy here.

725
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:03,310
Just run.

726
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,090
Just run.

727
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,170
Oh.

728
00:44:06,530 --> 00:44:06,970
Oh.

729
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,050
Oh!

730
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:08,710
Oh!

731
00:44:09,170 --> 00:44:09,970
Is it the baby?

732
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,290
Oh, it's the baby!

733
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:11,790
It's the baby!

734
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,050
It's the baby!

735
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:14,970
Once you're here, it's okay.

736
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:15,830
Oh.

737
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:17,050
Come on.

738
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:17,810
Can we take him down?

739
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:18,770
Take his...

740
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:18,890
Ah!

741
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,330
No pressure?

742
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:22,370
Oh my gosh.

743
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,410
Yeah, maybe we should.

744
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:27,230
Oh my gosh, why do I always need to reload?

745
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:44,130
I almost died!

746
00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:47,050
I don't know if we're but...

747
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:48,270
But...

748
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:49,930
Could have been anything.

749
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:54,190
Oh yeah, give us the big...

750
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,290
Oh, that's not even that much.

751
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,230
Some of the other guys are worth way more.

752
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,130
Yeah.

753
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:03,650
Anything?

754
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,770
Okay, now I think we can keep...

755
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:06,530
Wait, which...

756
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,230
Which is...

757
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,490
Oh, there's another big guy over there.

758
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:12,970
Oh, he's got a bomb!

759
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:14,130
Oh my god!

760
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,350
He was strapped with TNT!

761
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:17,190
Oh no!

762
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,450
Oh, wait, I aggroed the big guy?

763
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:22,530
Oh, nice.

764
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:23,870
Wait, that might be good though.

765
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:24,690
Where is he?

766
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,250
He's all the way down there.

767
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,610
Oh!

768
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:31,970
Nice.

769
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:33,170
Teamwork.

770
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:34,410
Oh, he's coming.

771
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:35,890
He's coming.

772
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:37,530
Oh, oh, oh, he's coming.

773
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:38,990
Oh, Lord, he's coming.

774
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:40,910
Oh, wait, I need to reload.

775
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,030
Oh, he's coming.

776
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:42,770
Oh, God.

777
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:47,070
Oh, Lord.

778
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:48,850
Oh, God, he's out.

779
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:54,750
Nice.

780
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,290
Yeah, we got him.

781
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:56,510
Nice.

782
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,330
You got him.

783
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,750
Nice.

784
00:45:58,010 --> 00:45:58,770
No, you got him.

785
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:01,730
Don't forget his money.

786
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:03,930
Rob him of all he's worth.

787
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,690
I like bullying them and just kind of like punching them over.

788
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:11,770
Yeah!

789
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,450
Where do we go though?

790
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,090
I actually, I can't...

791
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:16,950
There's like an arrow, but how do we...

792
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:17,570
Do we... Oh!

793
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:18,970
Wait, how'd you get over there?

794
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:21,830
Wait, how'd you get up there?

795
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,070
save the whole time.

796
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:25,870
Uh-oh.

797
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,790
He's got a sparkler.

798
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:28,910
Sparkler?

799
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,130
Oh, he dropped it.

800
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,930
Why are there so many zombies down here?

801
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,430
I know.

802
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:38,710
Nice.

803
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:45,170
Who wants to be buried in the catacombs where once you're buried there, you come back to life as a zombie?

804
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,410
Oh, it's one of those times.

805
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:48,170
Yeah.

806
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:49,830
Yeah.

807
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,190
Oh, yeah.

808
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,270
Oh, here I go.

809
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:55,170
Watch out!

810
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:56,470
Whoa!

811
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,230
Oh, no!

812
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:00,870
Leo!

813
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:02,570
Did I kill you?

814
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,610
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

815
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:06,630
Can I throw a grenade?

816
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:07,410
Will you die?

817
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:08,810
Try it, try it!

818
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,370
I need your help!

819
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:12,230
Ah!

820
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:14,570
Oh, I'm on fire.

821
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:15,890
Oh, yes, it did.

822
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,770
Oh, yeah, yeah, it really hurt me.

823
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:20,770
Yeah, yeah, it really hurt me.

824
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:26,610
I was flailing like a little cockroach.

825
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:27,330
No.

826
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:28,890
Wait, wait.

827
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:31,190
I think I threw you to your doom.

828
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:33,950
Thanks a lot, Leon.

829
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,690
Uh-oh, there's a big guy.

830
00:47:36,870 --> 00:47:37,830
Oh, there's a couple guys here.

831
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,550
These guys never go down easy.

832
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:41,430
Uh-oh.

833
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,510
Wait, how can I help you?

834
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:44,570
I don't know.

835
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,550
I'm gonna snipe him.

836
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:49,790
That's what I'm doing.

837
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,050
Keeping my distance?

838
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:55,750
I don't want to corner myself, though.

839
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,290
Where is he?

840
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,550
I don't know where to aim for this guy, Tommy.

841
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,050
I know!

842
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:01,950
Oh!

843
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,730
Is he down?

844
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:03,770
Yeah, he's down!

845
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,630
I keep on coming though.

846
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,230
Ah!

847
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:17,050
Okay.

848
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,790
I'm coming back to you!

849
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:20,850
I promise I'll make it!

850
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,870
Wait, can you see me?

851
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,050
I believe in you, yes.

852
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:23,570
Oh, okay.

853
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:24,910
Can you hear me?

854
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:28,690
Oh, is that guy?

855
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:29,510
That's the guy that's transforming.

Little up.

What's happening with my vision?

860
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,210
Is that happening to you too?

861
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:12,170
Yeah, me too.

862
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:12,690
Okay.

863
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,230
The inverted collars or something?

864
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:16,730
Yeah, yeah.

865
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:19,910
Okay, I'm gonna crank it!

866
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:20,950
And you'll come to me!

867
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:21,730
Oh, watch out!

868
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:23,210
Oh, watch out?

869
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:24,710
This guy behind you!

870
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,250
I'm trying to get him, but I have to reload!

871
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,650
Someone really thought this was true.

872
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:28,950
Oh!

873
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:30,270
Wow, he blew up!

874
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,190
Oh, gosh.

875
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:32,790
Oh, no!

876
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,190
Uh-oh.

877
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:33,790
Uh-oh.

878
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:34,490
Uh-oh.

879
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,630
Oh gosh, I'm down.

880
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:39,990
I'll try to cover you.

881
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:41,130
Thank you.

882
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:42,890
Woo-wee.

883
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:44,930
Who knew the bomb?

884
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,250
I really do.

885
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,830
Oh, it's the world's slowest bridge.

886
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,450
Please.

887
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:58,370
Please.

888
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,900
Oh, there's somebody behind you.

889
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,520
Oh gosh, he's an exploding guy, I think.

890
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:14,630

00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:48,170
Over here.

894
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:48,710
Where?

895
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,270
Oh, shoot!

896
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,030
I got it!

897
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:53,830
Oh.

898
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,360
Ouch, man.

899
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,020
These guys are brutal.

900
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:01,080
Okay.

901
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,860
Leon.

902
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:04,860
Leon.

903
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,560
Leon!

904
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Leon!

905
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,120
Leon!

906
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,340
Oh,

907
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:17,370
he explodes.

908
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,410
Or he transforms.

909
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:19,950
Why do you have to transform?

910
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:22,270
Oh, nice one.

911
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,420
I think Leon needs to apologize.

912
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,280
No, I didn't get the points.

913
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:33,760
It's okay.

914
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:34,740
I forgot.

915
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,360
Leon needs to apologize for throwing you off a cliff.

916
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:41,120
Then throwing a grenade at you.

917
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,540
I don't think he's very sorry.

918
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,220
But he's supposed to be sweet baby girl, right?

919
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:47,540
Right?

920
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,820
Yeah, we were talking about that.

921
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,060
Right before stream.

922
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:50,420
Oh!

923
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,180
What happened?

924
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:53,060
Oh my gosh.

925
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:53,640

926
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,380
I tripped.

927
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,720
I fell.

928
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,640
Thank you.

929
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,640
Need a hand.

930
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:04,500

00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,960

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:07,680
Yeah.

933
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,760
We were talking about that, how, like, people portray Leon as, like, they're like, give him cat ears.

934
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:14,700
Yeah.

935
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,380

936
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:16,640
Yeah.

937
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:17,200

948
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:03,880

Uh oh.

953
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,840

00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:19,420
Run, Leon.

955
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:20,860
Everything's falling apart.

I guess it would be hard to stand.

964
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:05,670
Oh, what do we do here?

965
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:06,350

I know.

969
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:24,410
Oh, the loot is getting fresh.

970
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,130
Oh, no, not the water.

971
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:28,550
Is the boulder gonna chase us?

972
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,170
Oh, the water!

973
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:31,710

00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,230
Oh my gosh.

976
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:41,010
Chris Redfield fought a boulder?

977
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:42,450
She's another...

978
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,710
What do we do?

979
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:45,170
Resident Evil?

980
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:45,770
Resident Evil?

981
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:46,890
I think so, yeah.

982
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:47,450
Right?

983
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,470
Is he from the first one?

984
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:51,050
Or the second one?

985
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,070
Or the third one?

986
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:52,950
Or the fourth one?

987
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:56,570
He's part of this one, the sixth one.

988
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:57,130
Oh!

989
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,820
He said, said, wait, I remember him in seven.

990
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,340
Performing stroke.

991
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,340
He's at the end.

992
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,440
We're from having a stroke.

993
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:12,380
Perform stroke.

994
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,900
Where do we go?

995
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,400
Oh, I don't know.

996
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,260
Do we here?

997
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,780
Oh gosh, our oxygen.

998
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:24,440
Down here?

999
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:25,300
Uh oh.

1000
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:27,800
Up, up, up.

1001
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:28,940
Perform stroke.

1002
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,780
First cranking it, now perform stroke.

1003
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,020
I know.

1004
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,640
What's this game?

1005
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:39,760
Oh, I think I see zombies.

1006
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:40,420
Oh no.

1007
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:44,300
Oh my god.

1008
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:45,180
The fish?

1009
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:45,620
Yeah.

1010
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:47,200
I think the fish is a friend.

1011
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:48,940
He eats them.

1012
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:49,800
Oh, that's you.

1013
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,520
Oh gosh.

1014
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:52,540
Not a zombie.

1015
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:54,020
Oh, they're here?

1016
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:54,440
Maybe?

1017
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,380
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

1018
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,560
Yeah, the fish eats the zombies.

1019
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,080
He thinks they're a tasty little treat.

1020
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,500
Watch out for zombies.

1021
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:05,440
Oh gosh.

1022
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:06,360
Oh, I could taste...

1023
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,260
I don't know.

1024
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:09,220
Oh!

1025
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,300
They can grab.

1026
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:10,860
They can grab.

1027
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,360
They can?

1028
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,480
Oh, I can grab.

1029
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,220
I can help you.

1030
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,060
Oh, space.

1031
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:15,080
Oh, never mind.

1032
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:15,820
Sorry, I left you.

1033
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,220
That's okay.

1034
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,940
Get your air.

1035
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:21,320
Oh.

1036
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,260
Oh, ew.

1037
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:22,840
Ew.

1038
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:26,420
Yeah, it's a pretty, it's a pretty icky sight.

1039
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:29,320
Wait, but I don't know if I'm going the right direction.

1040
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:30,560
I'll wait for you.

1041
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,380
I think so.

1042
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:32,820
Okay.

1043
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,200
Oh, he's grabbing me.

1044
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:36,980
Oh.

1045
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:38,860
Can I help you?

1046
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:39,920
Nah, it's okay.

1047
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,740
He just choked me a little bit underwater.

1048
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,520
Oh my god, I'm getting choked out again.

1049
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,300
Oh no.

1050
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,460
Do you need help?

1051
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,340
It's like the least optimal place to, you know.

1052
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,820
I actually don't know.

1053
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,620
Okay, I see you.

1054
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,580
I see you.

1055
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,440
I'm following you.

1056
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,260
All good things.

1057
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,580
Follow Nimi Nightmare and you'll see all good things.

1058
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:05,520
Oh, where are you going?

1059
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:06,440
Wait, did you just go inside?

1060
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:06,740
I don't know.

1061
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,960
Wait, we just...

1062
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,580
No, no, I'm not swimming.

1063
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:10,300
Oh, I'm kidding.

1064
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,820
K-Pers are good swimmers.

1065
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:12,900
Wait, really?

1066
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,040
Yeah.

1067
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,200
Is that air?

1068
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,920
Oh, I don't know.

1069
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:19,800
It's a great.

1070
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,920
Good thing we're, like, super strong.

1071
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:26,680
I know.

1072
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:29,060
Holy hell.

1073
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,280
Did he have AirPods in?

1074
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:32,040
Not my lucky day.

1075
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:32,580
You see that?

1076
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,240

I'm gonna pause for one second.

1081
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:19,520
I'm actually gonna move us down a little bit, I feel like.

1082
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,100
I'm gonna make us just little tiny heads.

1083
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:27,560
Just so that everybody can see it better.

1084
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,660
I'm swimming.

1085
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:29,640
You're swimming.

1086
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:31,040
I'm swimming.

1087
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,440
You take your swimming lessons?

1088
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:33,460
Yeah.

1089
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,020
Oh wait, I thought...

1090
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:37,340
Elena.

1091
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,260
Do you do something about these bars?

1092
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:40,600
I can try.

1093
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:41,640
Hold on.

1094
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:42,960
I need you to crank it.

1095
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:43,720
Crank it.

1096
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,080
I thought I saw a vase.

1097
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:47,560
Dang it.

1098
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:47,980
Okay.

00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,000
Oh, there it is.

1101
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:56,350
Oh.

1102
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,270
I'm just getting my cardio in.

1103
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:00,570
You thought.

1104
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,310
Little sigil is trying to be so sneaky.

1105
01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:07,570
Hmm.

1106
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:09,230
Hiding away from me.

1107
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:10,790
Where are you anyway?

1108
01:00:10,830 --> 01:00:11,410

1113
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:20,540
We're over here.

1114
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,100
It shows me...

1115
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,000
Am I supposed to do something?

1116
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,880
Maybe I was supposed to do something.

1117
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,900
I gotta use a laser.

1118
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,100
Oh, on the mirror.

1119
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:30,840
I see it.

1120
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,720
It's one of those.

1121
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,570
Thank you.

1122
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:39,270
You're welcome.

1123
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:42,170
Fish.

1124
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:43,510
No.

1125
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:45,130
Um, no.

1126
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:46,650
No.

1127
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:47,250
No.

1128
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:49,110
I mean, yes.

1129
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:50,710
Yes, fish, yes!

1130
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:51,230
Ah!

1131
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:53,390
Oh, what the hell?

1132
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,130
I've been swimming so slow now!

1133
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,130
It was so good a minute ago!

1134
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,230
I shot him.

1135
01:02:59,450 --> 01:02:59,810
Thanks.

1136
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:00,250
Oh.

1137
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:01,570
Thank you.

1138
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:02,090
You're welcome.

1139
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:03,310
You're my hero.

1140
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:03,990
Oh.

1141
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,290
I need some backup!

1142
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:05,950
Again!

1143
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:09,190
He's needy.

1144
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:09,990
I'm needy.

1145
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:11,010
Oh my gosh, hold on.

1146
01:03:11,170 --> 01:03:11,970
I'm reloading.

1147
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:14,490
Ah!

1148
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:17,550
You're fine.

1149
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:17,970
I'm reloading.

1150
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:43,830

1151
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:49,070
Hurry it up.

1152
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:51,930
Hurry it up!

1153
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,150
Hurry it up!

1154
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:54,490
Hurry it up!

1155
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:54,610
Sure,

1156
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,720
but we couldn't push over a rusted- I know.

1157
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,100
This thing is amazing.

1158
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:04,900
Oh god.

1159
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,260
We're getting slow-mo?

1160
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,080
Whoa!

1161
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:12,300
Oh, there's- it's also- can I not reload?

1162
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,660
I'm reloaded.

1163
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:17,220
Is that the boss?

1164
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,040
I think so.

1165
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:19,760
I think so.

1166
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,300
Is that the boss?

1167
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:21,060
I think so.

1168
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:21,240
I think so.

1169
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,740
Debra had.

1170
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,860
Did she transform into a shard?

1171
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,740
Yeah, maybe she did.

1172
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,240
Here it comes.

1173
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:32,100
Here it comes.

1174
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:32,760
Here it comes.

1175
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:33,860
Oh, ow.

1176
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:35,000
The cuties.

1177
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:35,860
Cuties.

1178
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,860
He even warned us this time.

1179
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,540
Thanks, Leon.

1180
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,760
Oh, my laser.

1181
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,040
Oh, my God.

1182
01:04:50,530 --> 01:04:51,190
Are we okay?

1183
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:52,790
I don't know, actually.

1184
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:56,090
Even a little close for comfort.

1185
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:02,540
I just shot it as soon as he said something.

1186
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,780
Me too.

1187
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:06,360
Sometimes you catch on fire.

1188
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:07,300
Sometimes you don't.

1189
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,540
It's just a little bit of a lottery.

1190
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,160
It's a spice of life.

1191
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:14,660
Oh yeah.

1192
01:05:15,460 --> 01:05:16,500
Quite spicy.

1193
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,320
Oh, it is Titanic now.

1194
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:19,940
Oh, Leon.

1195
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,000
Oh.

1196
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,480
I forgot we were in the 21st century.

1197
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:26,680
That was literally my thought.

1198
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,260
God, we have jets?

1199
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:31,300
Whoa.

1200
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,080
We're in like the Middle Ages.

1201
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:35,020
I know.

1202
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:37,920
Not the nuke.

1203
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:38,680
Oh my gosh.

1204
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,720
He's sterilizing the area.

1205
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,200
Oh, that's one way to call it.

1206
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,760
This stream is quiet.

1207
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,120
Thank God you're still alive.

1208
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:52,660
Where's Simmons?

1209
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,420
After speaking with you, he lied.

1210
01:05:54,440 --> 01:06:20,880
in a hurry shit where did he go as he was leaving he was talking to someone on the phone he didn't sound too happy well why didn't you take him down why he was right there i've got a tail on him he's on his way you have a pen just like private jet is preparing to leave for china what's in china oh yes take a look at these oh

1211
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:28,760
what is that explosion fire Fire in China.

1212
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:29,780
Uh-oh.

1213
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:32,620
The BSA confirmed it was the same one used in Eastern Europe.

1214
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,680
Six months ago called the sea virus.

1215
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:36,760
Is it the same one here?

1216
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:38,900
We saw cocoons just like that here.

1217
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,920
Yeah, we did see the cocoon virus.

1218
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,300
Cocoon virus.

1219
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,640
Is it gonna turn everyone into a beautiful lady like...

1220
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:46,520
Ada?

1221
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,080
Keep the project going!

1222
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:51,900
Don't stop the project!

1223
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:58,740
Listen, Hunnigan.

1224
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:00,620
I need you to take our data.

1225
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,240
Do you think they have radiation?

1226
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:05,440
What do you mean?

1227
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,520
From the bomb.

1228
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:07,580
Oh!

1229
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,040
We probably do too, right?

1230
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,080
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1231
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:15,540
If you hold your thumb up to it, if it's bigger than your thumb, it means you're dead, right?

1232
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:16,340
Really?

1233
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:17,220
Is that the case?

1234
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:21,320
That's what I learned from the Fallout TV show.

1235
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:30,120
If you hold your thumb up to the mushroom cloud, if the mushroom cloud's bigger than your thumb, it means you're done for.

1236
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:35,880
I got a dog tag.

1237
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:38,560
Look at you, A-Rank always.

1238
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:43,160
Your four deaths.

1239
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,060
Most of them went to the sauce.

1240
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:49,500
I know.

1241
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:52,740
I think three of them were, no.

1242
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,420
You got a lot more medals than me, though, I think.

1243
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,220
I'm not even on these metals.

1244
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,800
I don't even know what they are.

1245
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,400
Me neither.

1246
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,980
Oh, killed an enemy with a grenade.

1247
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,500
I definitely did that.

1248
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:11,380
My accuracy is way down.

1249
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:14,100
Because I started using guns.

1250
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:19,380
Yeah, the knife was not quite optimal here.

1251
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,840
I'm going back to the knife.

1252
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:22,540
I'm going back.

1253
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,120
Stick with what you're...

1254
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:25,460
Uh-oh.

1255
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,400
I've got money.

1256
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:28,920
Wait, do communication error.

1257
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:29,560
There's a dog tag.

1258
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,580
Oh, no, are we...

01:08:30,640 --> 01:09:00,040

Or am I going for you?

1261
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:02,920
Oh, wait, yeah.

1262
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:04,000
You're gone.

1263
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:06,460
It's not Steam Day.

1264
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:07,040
No?

1265
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:09,460
Oh.

1266
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:10,260
Well, okay.

1267
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:11,640
I'm in the cutscene.

1268
01:09:11,740 --> 01:09:12,420
Are you in a cutscene?

1269
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:12,980
No!

1270
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:13,760
I'm in the shop.

1271
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,700
Go to the cutscene.

1272
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,900
Okay, okay.

1273
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:18,000
Let's figure it out.

1274
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:19,780
Let's reconvene after the cutscene.

1275
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:22,800
I wonder what's happening.

01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:28,040

1278
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:12,800
You know, the seats look big, but maybe it's just that we're very small.

1279
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,980
Remember in the dining room?

1280
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:17,420

1291
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:44,820
We're not in the same game, right?

1292
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:45,960
No.

1293
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:47,900
I'm still in the cutscene.

1294
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,700
Don't suppose I think it was that plane, do you?

1295
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,420

1335
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:29,070
That's true.

Yeah.

1342
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:46,510

1343
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,110
Oh yeah.

1344
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,750

They're like the mobile games.

oh that sounds fun yeah there's youtube watch together wait there's blocks.io which is just minecraft discord what are you doing with your minecraft knockoff it It looks so similar.

1438
01:23:02,390 --> 01:23:02,510
Hmm.

1439
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:08,910
But there, but, but Delta Roon gets in trouble, okay.

1440
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:09,490
Yeah.

1441
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:13,670
Because Microsoft is a forgiving company.

1442
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:16,710
Is it still on here?

1443
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,390
It is still on there.

1444
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,150
Delta Roon is still on there.

1445
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,070
Yeah, if you search for it.

1446
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:22,210
Oh my gosh, you're right.

1447
01:23:22,830 --> 01:23:25,470
Delta Roon Chapter 1, Chapter 2.

1448
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:29,150
That's crazy.

1449
01:23:29,430 --> 01:24:27,590
you better take it down i'm gonna i'm gonna speed run it so i can play it before yeah before it's gone have you played delta rune mm-hmm have you played undertale yeah yeah i played undertale what about i like delta rune yeah i thought it's good so far it's it's the full thing is out now right or is there no yeah there's still one more part think right i think there's like three more chapters or something oh wow so it's not gonna be done for a long time but it's good what's there is good i will play is it connected to undertale at all or no it's like the same characters but it's like a different universe or something i don't know i don't think people know exactly how it's connected but people have theories that they're very passionate about.

1450
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:32,610
That sounds like the Undertale Delta Room community.

1451
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:39,590
Oh, people are saying they're on chapters 4 out of 7.

1452
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:41,050
Yeah.

1453
01:24:43,910 --> 01:24:45,250
It's good, though.

1454
01:24:46,110 --> 01:24:46,730
It's good.

1455
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:50,770
I will check it out.

1456
01:24:51,510 --> 01:24:51,790
Yeah.

1457
01:24:51,930 --> 01:24:52,510
I'll try.

1458
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:55,670
Do you want to try Steam again?

1459
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:58,650
Yeah, we should speaking of trying.

1460
01:24:58,730 --> 01:24:59,010
Okay.

1461
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,630
Up there.

1462
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,990
Continue.

1463
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:07,690
Oh, shoot.

1464
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:08,390
Did I leave?

1465
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:09,010
Oh, wait.

1466
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:09,650
I'm here.

1467
01:25:10,530 --> 01:25:11,170
Again.

1468
01:25:12,210 --> 01:25:13,610
Oh, wait, you came back.

1469
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:14,870
I'm here.

1470
01:25:15,370 --> 01:25:16,410
How did that happen?

1471
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:17,750
You just came back.

1472
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:20,950
I busted in.

1473
01:25:21,330 --> 01:25:22,610
Okay, I invite you.

1474
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:26,990
Okay.

1475
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:31,290
Like, you actually just popped out from the bottom of the screen.

1476
01:25:31,670 --> 01:25:32,370
Did I?

1477
01:25:34,490 --> 01:25:36,090
Oh, hello there.

1478
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:38,010
Hello.

1479
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,710
Did it send?

1480
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,190
Um, yes.

1481
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:44,410
It might be working.

1482
01:25:44,770 --> 01:25:45,370
Oh, okay.

1483
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,370
Fingies crossed.

1484
01:25:48,570 --> 01:25:49,670
Fingers crossed.

1485
01:25:52,230 --> 01:25:54,070
Can I skip this cutscene?

1486
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,670
I know.

1487
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,950
We can't, we can't skimp it.

1488
01:25:58,090 --> 01:25:58,750
Oh, nice, nice.

1489
01:25:59,010 --> 01:25:59,010
Okay.

1490
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:01,530
Oh, uh...

1491
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:02,910
Really, I want to knife him.

1492
01:26:03,090 --> 01:26:03,770
Yeah, knife!

1493
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:03,990
Who?

1494
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:05,890
I want to see the two.

1495
01:26:07,570 --> 01:26:09,470
Just pay attention to his...

1496
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,290
This is Benz.

1497
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:12,890
He's shooting at you!

1498
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,610
I don't see anything coming out.

1499
01:26:18,130 --> 01:26:18,910
It's like blue.

1500
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,770
Blue, too.

1501
01:26:22,390 --> 01:26:22,810
Yeah.

1502
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:24,650
Blue, too.

1503
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,490
Did you guys see anything?

1504
01:26:30,690 --> 01:26:30,950
Nice.

1505
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:36,270
Blue tube.

1506
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,810
Blue tube.

1507
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:38,570
Blue tube.

1508
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:40,710
There's something wrong with the pressure bulkhead.

1509
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:42,730
Get to the tail of the plane.

1510
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:44,230
Oh, there's a gun here.

1511
01:26:44,670 --> 01:26:45,390
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1512
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:46,190
I picked it up last time.

1513
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:47,250
I missed it last time.

1514
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:48,810
Oh, gosh.

1515
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:49,930
Wait, where is it?

1516
01:26:50,030 --> 01:26:51,850
I've got too many guns, though.

1517
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:53,710
Never enough guns.

1518
01:26:53,870 --> 01:26:54,190
Wait, where?

1519
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:56,310
Oh, wait.

1520
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:57,610
Do I not have it anymore?

1521
01:26:58,810 --> 01:26:59,070
Gun?

1522
01:26:59,070 --> 01:26:59,230
Gun?

1523
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:00,730
I already had it.

1524
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:01,610
I guess it's safe.

1525
01:27:02,030 --> 01:27:02,550
Oh, oh.

1526
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:04,170
Okay.

1527
01:27:05,890 --> 01:27:06,490
We going?

1528
01:27:06,850 --> 01:27:07,530
Yep, we going.

1529
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,150
Why are these people just sitting?

1530
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:17,570
I think that's what they all look like Helena tells them to do that.

1531
01:27:18,430 --> 01:27:18,470
Oh.

1532
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:20,710
Oh, there's an herb in here.

1533
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:21,730
There is?

1534
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,230
Oh, I can't take it.

1535
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:23,710
Dang.

1536
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:29,010
Are there more herbs?

1537
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:31,850
People brought their plants on the plane.

1538
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,730
I think that's like not allowed, no?

1539
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:35,950
How does it get through TSA?

1540
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:36,590
One more.

1541
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:38,490
Wait, there is?

1542
01:27:38,710 --> 01:27:39,450
That's true.

1543
01:27:40,450 --> 01:27:42,210
Oh, but it's both green ones.

1544
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:43,650
Can you combine the greens?

1545
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:44,570
You can.

1546
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:45,530
You can?

1547
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:46,670
Yeah, yeah.

1548
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:47,370
Oh, shoot.

1549
01:27:47,530 --> 01:27:48,930
Maybe I need to get through.

1550
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,810
Okay, let's go downstairs and then I'll combine.

1551
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,130
Okay.

1552
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:53,130
Oh, we can wait.

1553
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:55,730
I'm sure the plane's gonna be fine.

1554
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,110
Will the collab be fine?

1555
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,110
Oh, there's a thingy!

1556
01:28:00,170 --> 01:28:01,650
A serpent emblem.

1557
01:28:02,090 --> 01:28:02,610
Oh, nice!

1558
01:28:02,770 --> 01:28:04,370
There's more plant in here, too.

1559
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:05,430
Oh, yeah!

1560
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:06,610
Wait.

1561
01:28:07,930 --> 01:28:08,490
Eat.

1562
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,130
What can I throw away?

1563
01:28:11,130 --> 01:28:13,050
I don't really use the remote bombs.

1564
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:17,800
Oops.

1565
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,540
How do I... Okay.

1566
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,520
Discard.

1567
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:24,100
Oh, there's a... There's a treasure, too.

1568
01:28:24,340 --> 01:28:25,980
I missed everything last time.

1569
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,340
Maybe it's good we started over.

1570
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:29,520
Eye on the prize.

1571
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:31,980
Wait, can I open anything?

1572
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:32,620
Anything else?

1573
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:33,540
Nope.

1574
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:36,440
Did you get the treasure?

1575
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:37,240
Yeah.

1576
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,780
Thank you.

1577
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:43,340
Oh.

1578
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:43,720
Oh.

1579
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,540
Are you okay?

1580
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:46,460
I'm fine.

1581
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:51,260
Oh, I don't think we're going back upstairs.

1582
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:53,700
Oh, yeah.

1583
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:55,540
That's a one-way door, huh?

1584
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:57,160
Ow!

1585
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:57,620
Oh!

1586
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,480
Why did I do that?

1587
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:01,700
No, I walked right into it.

1588
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:02,140
Oh.

1589
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:05,040
You need my help?

1590
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:05,510
Yep.

1591
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:11,080
Together.

1592
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:16,400
We can push a boulder, but we can't turn this.

1593
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,000
Right?

1594
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,110
We made it in time.

1595
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:20,720
Oh, good.

1596
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,380
Oh, there he is.

1597
01:29:26,540 --> 01:29:28,540
Why are these guys in here?

1598
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,260
Oh, he is shooting.

1599
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:31,900
Yeah, he is shooting.

1600
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,640
Don't get too close.

1601
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:34,440
It smells!

1602
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,680
It really does smell.

1603
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:37,860
Open the hatch.

1604
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:38,580
Oh!

1605
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:39,900
Oh my god.

1606
01:29:40,820 --> 01:29:43,580
I'm getting my eyes kicked while I'm still.

1607
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:45,880
Ow!

1608
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:47,340
Let me reload!

1609
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:51,710
Are you slowly?

1610
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:53,430
Nice.

1611
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,790
Oh!

1612
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:57,290
I'm trying to reload!

1613
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:58,490
Oh my gosh!

1614
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,390
It's opening!

1615
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:03,250
I can't move!

1616
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:03,710
I can't move!

1617
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:04,310
Oh!

1618
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:04,930
Oh!

1619
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:25,360
okay all right ripped to him i think that probably transformed all the people though no oh yeah probably because that was i think the blue gas that transformed the people at the church oh geez that was me oh no

1620
01:30:29,600 --> 01:31:07,680
sorry yeah we just dropped him into a bunch of people um he might survive no way i don't think he will but the gas might like explode and yeah it's like fortnite he's dropping to thank the bus driver he would have thanked the bus driver now cool nice he kicked off my bus i was the bus driver i think he smells so yeah he gets stinky

1621
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:19,200
Well, the air should be all nice and fresh now, right?

1622
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,860
I can't stop the plane from crashing.

1623
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:23,400
Okay.

1624
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:24,940
Helena, we have to go.

1625
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,560
Did they respawn?

1626
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,480
I guess so, because I got that one, no?

1627
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,460
I didn't do.

1628
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,160
Or I thought so.

1629
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:35,080
Yeah, me too.

1630
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:36,680
Uh-oh.

1631
01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:37,320
Oh.

1632
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:38,440
No!

1633
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,440
They did all turn.

1634
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,800
They're all turned.

1635
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,360
Oh my god!

1636
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:46,000
I'm just...

1637
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,040
Oh my god!

1638
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,100
They're fresh zombies.

1639
01:31:52,420 --> 01:31:54,560
They should be easy to kill.

1640
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:55,840
Yeah.

1641
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:57,820
Hold on.

1642
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:58,420
I'm going to get that.

1643
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:00,840
Holy cow.

1644
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,080
The plan is to kill you.

1645
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:03,160
Oh, earlier.

1646
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,880
Oh no, you can only have one at a time!

1647
01:32:06,440 --> 01:32:06,440
Oh,

1648
01:32:11,670 --> 01:32:12,090
oh, oh.

1649
01:32:12,530 --> 01:32:13,270
Oh, oh, oh.

1650
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:52,370
turbulence we were too late we were too late oh i got him nice i'm glad there's not like a timer here oxygen masks deployed i know it's so immersive oh my gosh oh my gosh i'm coughing i've always felt that if these oxygen masks were deploying on a plane i would not know how to use them oh i always thought that if they deploy that's it like you're pretty dead i think

1651
01:32:56,110 --> 01:33:16,330
it just felt like a fun finale yeah well they always say like the the bag may not deflate or inflate but oxygen is flowing yeah yeah i always feel like there's a lie Like it wouldn't be flowing.

1652
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:17,870
The bag doesn't inflate.

1653
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:20,440
I don't understand how it doesn't inflate them.

1654
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:24,030
I wouldn't trust it.

1655
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:24,970
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1656
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:26,350
Oh, whoa, whoa.

1657
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:27,310
Ouch, ouch.

1658
01:33:27,830 --> 01:33:28,750
Uh-oh.

1659
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,430
This is why I can never sleep on planes.

1660
01:33:35,170 --> 01:33:36,670
It's a little extreme.

1661
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:39,950
Oh, there's another thing over here.

1662
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:40,830
There's more zombies.

1663
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:47,390
Sorry, I'm just collecting stuff.

1664
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:48,030
That's okay.

1665
01:33:49,670 --> 01:33:51,730
There's a serpent emblem over here.

1666
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:52,370
Oh, there is?

1667
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,630
Oh, good eye.

1668
01:33:55,910 --> 01:33:56,730
What the?

1669
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:57,670
How did you see that?

1670
01:33:57,670 --> 01:34:01,730
I feel like I didn't pick up a single one in the last chapter, though.

1671
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:05,330
Uh-oh.

1672
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:06,290
Be-woo.

1673
01:34:09,070 --> 01:34:11,090
Jesus Christ, how much worse can this get?

1674
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:43,710
When you open the hatch, you destabilize the plane by letting the pressure yeah i thought about that too leon it's on you nimi my controls nimi is in control my controls okay first switch off the autopilot to restore manual where's the autopilot press the third button in the fourth oh my gosh oh my gosh how do i know what the autopilot is where did all these people come from Oh my god,

1675
01:34:43,770 --> 01:34:48,910
it's

1676
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,560
a little chaotic, it's fine, we're fine.

1677
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:13,640
I wish I had an eye for it, though.

1678
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,280
Pull up, pull up!

1679
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:18,060
Oh, please reload.

1680
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:23,100
Oh my god, we're really pretty low, Nibby, are we okay?

1681
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:29,100
I like this, like, super...

1682
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:29,500
Aida!

1683
01:35:30,380 --> 01:35:30,900
Aida!

1684
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:33,680
She's gonna control the plane with her mind.

1685
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:33,960
Oh,

1686
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,100
I think I crashed the plane.

1687
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:44,100
No.

1688
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,420
I think you killed, like, 10,000 people.

1689
01:35:51,110 --> 01:35:54,430
I think this, um, I think...

1690
01:35:54,430 --> 01:35:55,310
They were all zombies?

1691
01:35:56,590 --> 01:36:04,690
That was, that was actually, like, a themed airport where it's, you know, they rebuild the buildings every day.

1692
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:07,390
It makes you look like you're crashing into the world.

1693
01:36:07,470 --> 01:36:08,830
Or, like, an experience.

1694
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:10,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1695
01:36:10,470 --> 01:36:10,850
Yeah.

1696
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:13,430
An escape room type of.

1697
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:14,250
Okay.

1698
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:15,350
I know the situation.

1699
01:36:15,690 --> 01:36:16,070
Awesome.

1700
01:36:17,670 --> 01:36:18,190
Cool.

1701
01:36:20,290 --> 01:36:20,630
Oh.

1702
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:23,030
Who is this?

1703
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:24,030
Sherry?

1704
01:36:24,150 --> 01:36:25,090
What are you doing here?

1705
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:26,410
Is that Chris?

1706
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,230
Is that Chris?

1707
01:36:29,270 --> 01:36:30,770
I heard you became an agent.

1708
01:36:31,450 --> 01:36:32,250
Why are you here?

1709
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:34,130
I'm tracking the man behind all this.

1710
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:36,170
Chief Security Advisor Simmons.

1711
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,290
What?

1712
01:36:38,090 --> 01:36:39,450
There must be some sort of mistake.

1713
01:36:39,650 --> 01:36:40,670
I report to Simmons.

1714
01:36:41,550 --> 01:36:42,590
He's your supervisor.

1715
01:36:42,590 --> 01:37:13,250
we're on our way to meet with him right now it's our chance we're gonna kill your supervisor Jake you're not Chris Jake she looks so pretty she's like flawless right now the world is burning down your orders were to avoid contact with anyone Leon's not just anyone he saved my life back in Recon City she was in the city

1717
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:47,510
This looks like the thing from the movie.

1718
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:48,710
An ex-girlfriend?

1719
01:37:49,010 --> 01:37:50,230
Is there Resident Evil?

1720
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:53,370
Yeah, there's a couple Resident Evil movies.

1721
01:37:54,450 --> 01:37:55,650
Are they good?

1722
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:56,990
Are they really good?

1723
01:37:57,570 --> 01:38:02,010
Actually, I've only seen the first one, I think.

1724
01:38:05,690 --> 01:38:06,130
I

1725
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:12,810
want to stab him with my knife.

1726
01:38:12,930 --> 01:38:14,090
You think that's a bad idea?

1727
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:15,670
No, no, do it, do it.

1728
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:19,270
Oh, shoot!

1729
01:38:21,070 --> 01:38:22,050
He's strong.

1730
01:38:22,410 --> 01:38:22,750
Is he?

1731
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:27,470
You're doing a great job distracting him, too.

1732
01:38:28,450 --> 01:38:31,090
I just gotta shoot him in his butt when he turns around.

1733
01:38:32,430 --> 01:38:33,410
Do I have anything else?

1734
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:34,110
I have this.

1735
01:38:34,950 --> 01:38:35,110
Oh.

1736
01:38:35,690 --> 01:38:36,730
If I can reload it.

1737
01:38:36,810 --> 01:38:37,050
Oh!

1738
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,510
Dodge, dodge, dodge!

1739
01:38:39,650 --> 01:38:40,070
Dodge!

1740
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,130
Dodge!

1741
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:41,630
Watch out!

1742
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:43,570
That didn't quite work.

1743
01:38:44,410 --> 01:38:45,110
He's running.

1744
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:46,390
Hey!

1745
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:47,170
Oh!

1746
01:38:47,410 --> 01:38:47,710
Dodge!

1747
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:50,530
I tried dodging again and it didn't work.

1748
01:38:51,090 --> 01:38:52,670
It's like a bull!

1749
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:58,070
Oh my gosh, it didn't work!

1750
01:38:59,270 --> 01:39:01,310
I pressed C so many times!

1751
01:39:02,690 --> 01:39:04,330
Oh my gosh, Jake is saving me.

1752
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:04,770
Wait, can I punch you?

1753
01:39:05,430 --> 01:39:08,090
Oh, Jake did not do anything to me.

1754
01:39:08,490 --> 01:39:09,830
Oh gosh, oh he's got me!

1755
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,730
He's got me!

1756
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:16,540
Heal?

1757
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:17,740
Oh, I have no heal.

1758
01:39:17,980 --> 01:39:18,880
Wait, I have a spray.

1759
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:22,340
Okay.

1760
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:23,440
I have too many guns.

1761
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:25,560
Where'd he go?

1762
01:39:26,500 --> 01:39:26,520
Oh.

1763
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:28,260
Okay.

1764
01:39:29,660 --> 01:39:31,780
He must be the final boss of this chapter.

1765
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:32,600
He must be.

1766
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:37,180
Wait, but there's a ladder here.

1767
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,780
I want to climb it.

1768
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:41,780
Wait.

1769
01:39:42,260 --> 01:39:45,300
Oh, there was stuff to explode.

1770
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:46,780
Oh.

1771
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:48,700
Oh.

1772
01:39:49,240 --> 01:39:49,880
Oh.

1773
01:39:49,880 --> 01:39:50,520
Oh, man.

1774
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,100
That would have been cool.

1775
01:39:52,540 --> 01:39:55,200
It would have been really good to use.

1776
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:00,060
I mean, we got him, no problem.

1777
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:03,600
He's still, yeah, he ran away with his little tail between his legs.

1778
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,420
I'm here, too.

1779
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:09,600
Oh, whoa.

1780
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:11,680
Oh,

1781
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:17,140
shoot.

1782
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,740
I thought I was going to cut her throat.

1783
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:19,380
Perfect.

1784
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:25,140
Wait, are you okay?

1785
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,040
Yeah, I'm okay.

1786
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:26,760
Punched?

1787
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:28,200
No, I got it.

1788
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,420
Are we separated?

1789
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,360
Yeah, we're...

1790
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:31,480
I'm fighting him right now!

1791
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:33,000
Oh my gosh.

1792
01:40:33,340 --> 01:40:35,080
Why does my dodge not work anymore?

1793
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,140
How do I get to you?

1794
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:41,880
Holy cow.

1795
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:43,260
Oh, geez.

1796
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:46,570
I'm...

1797
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:49,490
Maybe I never do how to dodge, did we give with...

1798
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:52,010
Oh my gosh, a person thinks I'm not meaning to!

1799
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:55,230
Can I shoot something?

1800
01:40:55,850 --> 01:40:56,510
No, it's okay!

1801
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:58,530
Oh my gosh, wait, if that guy distracts him.

1802
01:40:59,270 --> 01:41:00,370
Wait, I'll distract him.

1803
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:00,710
Oh!

1804
01:41:01,090 --> 01:41:01,650
Yeah, get over!

1805
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:02,990
Yes, yes, yes!

1806
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:05,870
Go over here.

1807
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:07,130
Come, come, come, come!

1808
01:41:07,870 --> 01:41:09,730
Come, come, come, come, come!

1809
01:41:09,770 --> 01:41:10,810
Come, come, mister!

1810
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:15,630
Okay, I'm just doing some auto maintenance right now.

1811
01:41:16,090 --> 01:41:16,930
Oh, sorry, I'm Jake.

1812
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:18,690
Just casually.

1813
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:20,870
If you're doing maintenance, okay.

1814
01:41:21,490 --> 01:41:24,230
Yeah, I'm just working on a car really quick.

1815
01:41:24,290 --> 01:41:24,650
Wow!

1816
01:41:25,370 --> 01:41:26,290
Are you kidding?

1817
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:27,970
I got a kick out of this.

1818
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:31,290
Wow!

1819
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:33,370
Okay, incoming!

1820
01:41:33,550 --> 01:41:34,390
Car, incoming!

1821
01:41:43,360 --> 01:41:45,640
She was right on top of the things.

1822
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:47,060
How did I shoot too soon?

1823
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,460
Don't get me started, but maybe the four of us can stop him once and for all.

1824
01:41:51,080 --> 01:41:51,380
Okay.

1825
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:52,680
Okay.

1826
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,580
I'm gonna stab him.

1827
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:55,340
Oh.

1828
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,120
Was that you?

1829
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:56,940
My little knife.

1830
01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:57,140
Oh.

1831
01:41:57,380 --> 01:41:58,080
That wasn't me.

1832
01:41:58,240 --> 01:41:58,460
Okay.

1833
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:02,120
I'm so almost out of bullets, it's actually kind of insane.

1834
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:03,300
Oh no.

1835
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:04,420
I like him actually.

1836
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,540
Can I share with you?

1837
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:06,160
I...

1838
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:38,820

1839
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:42,240
I'm also low on ammo.

1840
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:42,760
Yeah.

1841
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,200
Wait, I could use these remote bombs too.

1842
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:52,540
Come here!

1843
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:54,460
Oh,

1844
01:42:57,740 --> 01:42:58,060
okay.

1845
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:02,560
How do I actually activate it?

1846
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:04,720
Oh, okay.

1847
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:05,340
I'm slicing him.

1848
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:05,980
You are?

1849
01:43:06,460 --> 01:43:08,020
I'm slicing him.

1850
01:43:10,040 --> 01:43:12,020
Okay, I'm coming back with bombs.

1851
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:15,000
My remote bombs.

1852
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:16,080
Ouch.

1853
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:20,860
Okay, everybody might get hit.

1854
01:43:20,980 --> 01:43:21,440
So sorry.

1855
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:23,820
Okay, should I leave?

1856
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:24,980
Oh!

1857
01:43:25,860 --> 01:43:26,760
Pretty nice!

1858
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:28,680
It worked!

1859
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:33,440
Good one.

1860
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:34,100
Good one.

1861
01:43:44,010 --> 01:43:46,230
I did nothing the entire fight.

1862
01:43:46,630 --> 01:43:48,190
You did!

1863
01:43:48,450 --> 01:43:48,770
You did!

1864
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:50,490
I gave in with white bomb!

1865
01:43:56,590 --> 01:43:57,470
Sherry, listen!

1866
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:00,710
Until we get there, I need you to- Oh!

1867
01:44:03,010 --> 01:44:03,890
Oh, Sherry.

1868
01:44:03,930 --> 01:44:04,710
Are they gonna be alright?

1869
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:07,490
Let's just hope that Jake hits as good as he thinks he is.

1870
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:09,090
Are they fighting?

1871
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:09,990
Are they beefing?

1872
01:44:10,090 --> 01:44:11,290
He is jealous.

1873
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:12,730
He is jealous.

1874
01:44:15,090 --> 01:44:17,190
I have to go to the bathroom.

1875
01:44:17,570 --> 01:44:17,910
Okay.

1876
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:20,810
I'll be right back.

1877
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:21,210
Yeah.

1878
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:25,070
After the plane went down, I linked in a minute ago, but you weren't picking me up.

1879
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,870
Listen, the building Agent Berkin mentioned isn't far off.

1880
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:29,450
Just stick to your current route, okay?

1881
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:30,370
Okay.

1882
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:33,150
Oh, thank goodness there's ammo.

1883
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:36,670
Oh, sweet ammo.

1884
01:44:38,490 --> 01:44:40,090
Guys, I'm utilizing the weapons.

1885
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:42,150
We are killing it.

1886
01:44:42,330 --> 01:44:43,010
We're killing it.

1887
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:45,210
Nimi, we're doing it.

1888
01:44:47,710 --> 01:44:52,770
Sweet, sweet, I'm a...

1889
01:44:52,770 --> 01:44:53,570
They delicious.

1890
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:54,970
I'll cover.

1891
01:44:55,810 --> 01:44:57,630
Okay, there's a door here.

1892
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:01,170
We don't need to go inside just yet.

1893
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:02,630
I'll wait.

1894
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,610
Oh yeah.

1895
01:45:09,250 --> 01:45:10,770
Leon, get off your phone!

1896
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:11,610
Leon!

1897
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:13,270
Leon!

1898
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:14,550
We have so much to do.

1899
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,130
Wait, Leon, watch this, watch this.

1900
01:45:19,270 --> 01:45:21,550
I can only dodge one way.

1901
01:45:23,170 --> 01:45:24,350
I don't know how to dodge.

1902
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:26,850
Even if I hold left.

1903
01:45:30,550 --> 01:45:31,790
I can only...

1904
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:32,390
Wait, Leon.

1905
01:45:33,350 --> 01:45:33,610
Wait.

1906
01:45:34,630 --> 01:45:36,490
Leon, are my boobs in your face?

1907
01:45:37,130 --> 01:45:38,030
He looked away!

1908
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:38,830
What a gentleman!

1909
01:45:44,110 --> 01:45:45,810
He's playing Uma Musume!

1910
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:49,590
Naplings, this one's for you.

1911
01:45:49,610 --> 01:45:50,150
you.

1912
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:52,270
Leon's playing Meow Tower.

1913
01:45:52,870 --> 01:45:54,150
It's the best game.

1914
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:59,430
Wait, does the door require two players?

1915
01:46:04,860 --> 01:46:05,480
Oh, it does.

1916
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:06,660
Leon.

1917
01:46:08,280 --> 01:46:08,960
Hurry it up.

1918
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:09,900
Can you hear it?

1919
01:46:10,500 --> 01:46:11,040
This way.

1920
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:11,920
Hello?

1921
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:12,760
Hi.

1922
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:13,740
What are you playing?

1923
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:15,100
Meow Tower?

1924
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:16,880
Do you know Meow Tower?

1925
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:17,800
No.

1926
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:22,020
Is that a, is that a YouTube playable?

1927
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:28,560
No, it's a phone app, but I really like nongrams, like Peacross.

1928
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,740
Oh, I love Peacross.

1929
01:46:31,120 --> 01:46:43,720
Yeah, you should play Meow Tower that you basically, you do the puzzles, and then you collect cans of tuna, and you spend it on ways to decorate the little cat's rooms.

1930
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,440
That sounds like this game I've been playing called SqueeCross.

1931
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:48,360
SqueeCross?

1932
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:51,060
Just like that, but you have a rat.

1933
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:57,120
You saw Picross puzzles to buy furniture and clothes for your wrap.

1934
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,180
For the wrap!

1935
01:46:58,320 --> 01:46:59,100
Wait, that's so cute!

1936
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:00,600
It's really good!

1937
01:47:00,900 --> 01:47:01,720
Wait, what's it called?

1938
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,200
Ket?

1939
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:03,360
Meow Tower.

1940
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:04,700
Meow Tower.

1941
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,220
Yeah, I play it every day.

1942
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:09,820
Now I'm gonna play Squid Cross.

1943
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:11,720
Yeah, I recommend it.

1944
01:47:11,780 --> 01:47:13,220
It might be my Game of the Year.

1945
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:14,240
Oh, nice!

1946
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,080
It's Game of the Year.

1947
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,040
It's so good.

1948
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,260
Sherry said she was meeting Simmons in the Koon Lung building.

1949
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:22,400
The first thing you're gonna need to do is cut.

1950
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:52,680

1951
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,540
There's not animal stuff as well.

1952
01:47:54,980 --> 01:47:55,740
I hope not.

1953
01:47:56,120 --> 01:47:57,560
I'm not good with that kind of stuff.

1954
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:58,380
Me neither.

1955
01:48:02,360 --> 01:48:02,520
Oh.

1956
01:48:03,020 --> 01:48:04,100
Oh, my God.

1957
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:04,660
This way.

1958
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:05,620
I think we know which way.

1959
01:48:05,620 --> 01:48:06,040
Are we just running?

1960
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:07,040
What was that?

1961
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:09,700
Trouble.

1962
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:10,600
Strawberry?

1963
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:13,240
Oh, my God.

1964
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:14,340
Are you okay, mister?

1965
01:48:15,220 --> 01:48:16,280
Where did it go?

1966
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:17,580
I don't think he is.

1967
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:20,400
Oh.

1968
01:48:20,860 --> 01:48:21,400
Oh.

Wait.

1972
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:04,760
He was just birthed in front of us.

1973
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:05,560
Yeah.

1974
01:49:08,020 --> 01:49:09,640
Well, he can be stabbed.

1975
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:11,260
Yeah, anything can get stabbed.

1976
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,320
Wait, I think we gotta...

1977
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:13,700
Oh, no, he's gonna reconnect, no?

1978
01:49:14,200 --> 01:49:14,500
Oh.

1979
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,780
Do we have to watch the cutscene every time, too?

1980
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:18,620
This isn't working.

1981
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:20,540
How long are we gonna keep doing this?

1982
01:49:20,860 --> 01:49:21,980
Should we just avoid him?

1983
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:23,260
Yeah.

1984
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:25,240
Well, I don't use ammo.

1985
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:26,880
Um, I have grenade!

1986
01:49:28,420 --> 01:49:29,440
Oh, catch.

1987
01:49:29,900 --> 01:49:32,820
Oh, I see where a key is.

1988
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:33,960
Okay.

1989
01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:38,740
I'll go try and grab it.

1990
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,560
I hate the sound that it makes.

1991
01:49:40,620 --> 01:49:41,520
It's like a baby.

1992
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:42,900
Yeah.

1993
01:49:43,240 --> 01:49:44,060
Wait, am I in here?

1994
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:45,280
Wait, I think it's dead.

1995
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:47,040
Wait.

1996
01:49:47,540 --> 01:49:50,640
Oh, the key is in there.

1997
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:53,520
We need to find the breaker to kill these live wires.

1998
01:49:54,240 --> 01:49:54,980
I have proven.

1999
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:57,360
Is it still alive?

2000
01:49:58,440 --> 01:49:59,320
I don't know.

2001
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:02,420
It's making sounds, but...

2002
01:50:02,420 --> 01:50:03,880
You need to unlock it from the other side.

2003
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:05,300
It seems defeated.

2004
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:06,720
There's so much.

2005
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:09,060
First, we have to find a breaker.

2006
01:50:09,660 --> 01:50:11,520
Then we gotta find a way to open that.

2007
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:12,700
Um, okay.

2008
01:50:13,040 --> 01:50:14,060
Wait, is this a breaker?

2009
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,760
This looks like a breaker.

2010
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,260
Oh, yeah, you did it.

2011
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,700
I found another door.

2012
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,780
That guy's still crying.

2013
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:27,560
He's just crying around over there.

2014
01:50:31,200 --> 01:50:31,420
Oh.

2015
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:33,640
Wait, where did you go?

2016
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:35,060
I'm by where the breaker was.

2017
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:36,380
Oh, where the...

2018
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:37,340
Where...

2019
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:37,880
Not the breaker.

2020
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,340
Where the things...

2021
01:50:39,340 --> 01:50:40,640
I think he's right behind me.

2022
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:43,020
Excuse me.

2023
01:50:44,600 --> 01:50:45,120
Okay.

2024
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:47,820
That guy...

2025
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:48,260
Key?

2026
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:52,320
Ooh.

2027
01:50:53,660 --> 01:50:54,120
Oh.

2028
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:54,940
Oh.

2029
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:55,620
Are this fish?

2030
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:56,200
Wait.

2031
01:50:58,380 --> 01:50:59,000
Nice.

2032
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,400
What's in there?

2033
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:02,860
Nothing.

2034
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:03,960
Ugh.

2035
01:51:04,120 --> 01:51:04,500
Nothing.

2036
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:06,640
These guys are freaky looking.

2037
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:07,420
I know!

2038
01:51:07,760 --> 01:51:09,060
I don't want to eat that.

2039
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,060
Okay, through here.

2040
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:16,100
Is it a monkfish?

2041
01:51:16,220 --> 01:51:17,000
Is that what it's called?

2042
01:51:18,780 --> 01:51:19,300
Interesting.

2043
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:20,720
Got an ugly one.

2044
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:25,120
Just reach your hand through.

2045
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:25,840
Yeah.

2046
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,920
You're a big boy, Leon, Kennedy.

2047
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:31,360
You don't want it from the other side.

2048
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,160
Oh, I got it.

2049
01:51:32,200 --> 01:51:32,700
I saw it.

2050
01:51:32,980 --> 01:51:33,380
Ah!

2051
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:34,600
Oh my god!

2052
01:51:34,780 --> 01:51:36,040
Are you okay?

2053
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:38,020
There's a hand on my face.

2054
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:41,460
Sorry, I might have thrown it over there.

2055
01:51:41,700 --> 01:51:42,400
Did you really?

2056
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:44,560
You can pick it up and throw it.

2057
01:51:45,180 --> 01:51:45,560
You can!

2058
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:48,160
There's the serpent.

2059
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,120
Oh, gosh.

2060
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:49,960
It's coming at me.

2061
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:51,220
Over here.

2062
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:56,370
Uh-oh, I missed.

2063
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:02,110
Do you want to get the serpent emblem?

2064
01:52:02,770 --> 01:52:04,390
Um, oh, there you are.

2065
01:52:04,470 --> 01:52:05,230
I was like, where are you?

2066
01:52:05,450 --> 01:52:06,690
There's one over here.

2067
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:08,410
Oh.

2068
01:52:10,190 --> 01:52:11,530
He got that guy.

2069
01:52:12,510 --> 01:52:12,810
Nice.

2070
01:52:14,150 --> 01:52:15,030
Yeah, take him out.

2071
01:52:15,270 --> 01:52:15,910
Take him out.

2072
01:52:16,750 --> 01:52:17,630
That guy, duh?

2073
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:22,030
Or...

2074
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:23,830
I feel like he always comes back.

2075
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:25,630
Yeah, eventually, right?

2076
01:52:26,630 --> 01:52:29,010
He just twitches for a little bit and then...

2077
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:32,330
Emblem.

2078
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:34,290
There's an emblem over here.

2079
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:34,670
I see.

2080
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:35,290
Thank you.

2081
01:52:35,550 --> 01:52:35,810
Yeah.

2082
01:52:35,930 --> 01:52:36,890

01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,920
I can't reach this thing.

2086
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:48,720
Oh, there we go.

2087
01:54:49,660 --> 01:54:50,920
Stupid, ugly.

2088
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,700
Oh, I'm going to throw it.

2089
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:54,060
Yeah.

2090
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:55,840
Throw it against the wall.

2091
01:54:58,080 --> 01:54:59,900
How did you pick it up?

2092
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,320
Oh, it attached to him.

2093
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:02,580
Stop.

2094
01:55:06,190 --> 01:55:08,590
Oh, oh, oh, ew, ew, it's crawling on me.

2095
01:55:08,710 --> 01:55:09,530
I hate it.

2096
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:12,470
Yeah, it's pretty icky.

2097
01:55:13,470 --> 01:55:14,690
It is icky.

2098
01:55:14,990 --> 01:55:16,330
We got him.

2099
01:55:19,420 --> 01:55:21,300
I hate the sound that they make.

2100
01:55:21,440 --> 01:55:22,880
I don't like it at all.

2101
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:29,020
That's a huge microwave!

2102
01:55:30,240 --> 01:55:31,880
Also, it's in Japanese.

2103
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:34,920
But we're in China.

2104
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:37,720
Fushigi.

2105
01:55:39,300 --> 01:55:40,800
Okay, so you got the second key.

2106
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:41,920
Did you just put it in?

2107
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:42,320
Oh.

2108
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:43,680
No, not yet.

2109
01:55:44,640 --> 01:55:46,980
I'm just opening this shortcut.

2110
01:55:47,680 --> 01:55:48,520
Wait, well, this is...

2111
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:49,280
What did I just flip?

2112
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:50,840
Yeah, this is good.

2113
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:53,860
Oh, we can go up the ladder.

2114
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:56,080
Did you come up here?

2115
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,060
No, I didn't.

2116
01:55:57,240 --> 01:55:58,780
I didn't notice there was a ladder.

2117
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:03,920
Oh, I can launch you!

2118
01:56:04,940 --> 01:56:05,720
Throw me.

2119
01:56:08,500 --> 01:56:08,900
No.

2120
01:56:09,220 --> 01:56:10,240
No, do a flip.

2121
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:12,900
She's cracked.

2122
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,200
She's crazy.

2123
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:19,940
All right.

2124
01:56:20,660 --> 01:56:21,720
All right, Helena.

2125
01:56:22,660 --> 01:56:24,700
Oh, yeah, maybe the key is over there.

2126
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,360
Helena against the world.

2127
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:31,020
Yeah, I'm like right next to it, but I don't know where it is.

2128
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,860
Why is there scary music?

2129
01:56:37,520 --> 01:56:38,760
You're on your own.

2130
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:39,880
I don't like that.

2131
01:56:40,780 --> 01:56:41,220
This time.

2132
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:42,300
Oh, no, I need you.

2133
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:43,880
You need me?

2134
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:44,240
Yeah.

2135
01:56:44,360 --> 01:56:44,760
Oh, wait.

2136
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:46,360
I can open this over here.

2137
01:56:48,380 --> 01:56:48,880
Come on.

2138
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:49,220
Uh-oh.

2139
01:56:50,060 --> 01:56:54,540
And then you come to where the, the, um, what's it called, was.

2140
01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:57,620
I keep wanting to say the strawberries.

2141
01:56:58,740 --> 01:56:59,600
I mean, they are strawberries.

2142
01:57:00,140 --> 01:57:00,440
It's weird.

2143
01:57:00,540 --> 01:57:01,220
Isn't it right here?

2144
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:02,020
No.

2145
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:03,720
I'll open this.

2146
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:04,400
Wait, wait, wait.

2147
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:04,900
Wait, don't run.

2148
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:05,300
Don't.

2149
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:05,740
I'm right here.

2150
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:06,200
I'm right here.

2151
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:07,200
Oh, oh.

2152
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:10,800
Nice.

2153
01:57:11,960 --> 01:57:12,500
Uh-oh.

2154
01:57:12,620 --> 01:57:13,800
Are they all, like, respawning?

2155
01:57:14,020 --> 01:57:14,140
Oh.

2156
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,800
I think so.

2157
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,740
I'm spinning!

2158
01:57:18,100 --> 01:57:18,860
I'm spinning!

2159
01:57:19,860 --> 01:57:23,290
Uh oh.

2160
01:57:23,330 --> 01:57:26,510
Oh, he's throwing his hands.

2161
01:57:26,730 --> 01:57:27,570
Throwing hands.

2162
01:57:28,290 --> 01:57:29,150
It's so nasty.

2163
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:30,390
It's so itchy.

2164
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:34,430
Wait, oh, stop it, stop, stop, stop.

2165
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:36,390
Don't, don't, don't, don't, where'd he go?

2166
01:57:38,570 --> 01:57:39,410
Stop it, stop.

2167
01:57:40,290 --> 01:57:40,570
Stop it, stop.

2168
01:57:40,930 --> 01:57:41,650
Stop, stop, stop.

2169
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:43,790
He's just tanking.

2170
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:45,990
Oh, I threw it.

2171
01:57:46,610 --> 01:57:46,910
No!

2172
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:47,310
No!

2173
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:47,810
No!

2174
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:48,610
Oh my gosh!

2175
01:57:49,130 --> 01:57:49,750
Oh my god!

2176
01:57:51,810 --> 01:57:52,710
I think I got him.

2177
01:57:53,530 --> 01:57:54,110
Wait, nope.

2178
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:57,070
He's just slithering along.

2179
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:00,570
No!

2180
01:58:02,510 --> 01:58:03,710
No more!

2181
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:05,390
Too many hands!

2182
01:58:08,330 --> 01:58:09,970
Throw the hand, oh!

2183
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:13,290
That gave a lot of skill points, though.

2184
01:58:13,970 --> 01:58:15,190
Ooh, oh yeah!

2185
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:15,910
Oh yeah!

2186
01:58:16,610 --> 01:58:18,590
I have one bullet.

2187
01:58:18,810 --> 01:58:19,310
That's crazy.

2188
01:58:20,810 --> 01:58:21,910
Oh, right here?

2189
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:25,450
Hey, Elena.

2190
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:26,230
I'm coming.

2191
01:58:29,200 --> 01:58:29,580
Elena.

2192
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:32,620
Oh.

2193
01:58:32,900 --> 01:58:33,140
Oh.

2194
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:34,300
Oh, golly.

2195
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:36,880
Okay, I'm going to throw a grenade inside.

2196
01:58:38,060 --> 01:58:38,080
Okay.

2197
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:39,280
Watch out.

2198
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,620
Ooh, nice.

2199
01:58:45,460 --> 01:58:46,660
That works.

2200
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:48,100
Oh, okay.

2201
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:49,360
Um.

2202
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:51,580
Oopsie.

2203
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:53,680
Let me just reload and...

2204
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:53,860
BOW!

2205
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:55,360
Nice!

2206
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,920
Oh, they really...

2207
01:58:58,460 --> 01:58:59,520
They're just wriggling.

2208
01:58:59,980 --> 01:59:00,420
I know.

2209
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:01,420
They're nasty.

2210
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:02,840
They drop a lot of stuff, though.

2211
01:59:03,800 --> 01:59:04,740
Which is pretty nice.

2212
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:05,660
And a key!

2213
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,860
Oh, it's these kinds of toilets!

2214
01:59:09,440 --> 01:59:11,120
Ew, they came from the toilet!

2215
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:12,360
Yeah.

2216
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:16,160
I've never had to use one of these.

2217
01:59:16,620 --> 01:59:18,040
I've had to just once.

2218
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:18,900
Oh.

2219
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:19,380
Oh.

2220
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:21,880
Yeah...

2221
01:59:22,700 --> 01:59:24,900
I wouldn't even know how.

2222
01:59:25,460 --> 01:59:26,240
Oh my god!

2223
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:28,220
You okay?

2224
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:30,180
I'm okay.

2225
01:59:30,740 --> 01:59:33,020
It's just a regular old Thursday.

2226
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:36,120
There's another one!

2227
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:37,800
Get him!

2228
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:38,680
Yeah!

2229
01:59:39,160 --> 01:59:39,720
Yeah!

2230
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:40,540
Oh my gosh!

2231
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:44,800
Oh, there's a whole ass guy coming out of there now.

2232
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:48,390
Stop!

2233
01:59:49,010 --> 01:59:50,350
I always miss the QT.

2234
01:59:50,610 --> 01:59:50,950
Stop!

2235
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:51,310
Ow, ow!

2236
01:59:52,470 --> 01:59:54,630
Should we just run?

2237
01:59:57,880 --> 01:59:58,980
I'm going to blow them up.

2238
01:59:59,740 --> 01:59:59,860
Again.

2239
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:00,260
Okay, okay.

2240
02:00:00,340 --> 02:00:01,020
I'm going to run.

2241
02:00:01,380 --> 02:00:02,240
Oh, jeez.

2242
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:04,260
Are you okay?

2243
02:00:04,620 --> 02:00:05,380
Yeah, I'm okay.

2244
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:11,910

2246
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:17,650

That was so romantic.

2252
02:01:08,160 --> 02:01:11,120
Would it would have been if he was a little cuter.

2253
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,380
I thought it was going to tell me to press V, but it didn't say anything.

2254
02:01:15,880 --> 02:01:16,040
Okay.

2327
02:08:58,720 --> 02:08:59,380
Ada, please.

2328
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:00,160
Oh.

2329
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:02,180
Oh, she ninja bombed you.

2330
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:03,500
It's been fun.

2331
02:09:07,720 --> 02:09:09,040
She's so cool.

2332
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:09,660
Yeah.

2333
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:12,660
With her little...

2334
02:09:12,660 --> 02:09:15,620
She has her own story on here, too, right?

2335
02:09:15,700 --> 02:09:16,360
Yeah, yeah.

2336
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:18,720
Your friend likes to play hard to get.

2337
02:09:19,080 --> 02:09:19,420
Uh-oh.

2338
02:09:19,620 --> 02:09:20,600
Is that the smoke?

2339
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:21,160
Is that...

2340
02:09:21,840 --> 02:09:22,580
Oh, my God.

2341
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:23,500
Where do you go?

2342
02:09:23,600 --> 02:09:23,860
Okay.

2343
02:09:25,880 --> 02:09:27,440
Did he answer himself?

2344
02:09:27,620 --> 02:09:28,680
I think so.

2345
02:09:30,700 --> 02:09:31,820
Don't lose her.

2346
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:32,500
I won't.

2347
02:09:34,380 --> 02:09:38,180
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!

2348
02:09:38,780 --> 02:09:40,160
He's mad!

2349
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:41,700
I've got her!

2350
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:42,680
Who's that?

2351
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:44,140
Is that Chris?

2352
02:09:45,280 --> 02:09:46,880
When will we meet Chris?

2353
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:53,480
Whoa.

2354
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:56,080
Why should you transform?

2355
02:09:56,420 --> 02:09:57,240
Who are these guys?

2356
02:09:58,320 --> 02:09:59,000
I don't know.

2357
02:10:02,410 --> 02:10:03,010
Oh!

2358
02:10:03,230 --> 02:10:04,210
Oh my gosh, it is!

2359
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:04,810
Chris!

2360
02:10:05,910 --> 02:10:07,170
Oh, I'm defending her!

2361
02:10:07,330 --> 02:10:07,850
Milady!

2362
02:10:08,230 --> 02:10:09,750
I won't let them hurt you.

2363
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:11,590
He is in love with her.

2364
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:12,550
I'm gonna...

2365
02:10:12,550 --> 02:10:12,950
Yeah.

2366
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:15,290
She's just standing there.

2367
02:10:17,230 --> 02:10:19,750
She likes watching men fight over her.

2368
02:10:22,370 --> 02:10:24,430
Oh, so dramatic.

2369
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:25,410
Chris?

2370
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:27,970
Leon?

2371
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:30,770
What are you doing here?

2372
02:10:33,010 --> 02:10:33,730
Chris!

2373
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:38,130
Put your gun down, Chris.

2374
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:39,550
She's a key witness.

2375
02:10:39,710 --> 02:10:40,330
We need her.

2376
02:10:40,630 --> 02:10:41,230
A witness?

2377
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:42,950
She's the one who did all this!

2378
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:43,710
No.

2379
02:10:44,090 --> 02:10:44,770
It wasn't her.

2380
02:10:44,870 --> 02:10:46,950
It was Simmons, the National Security Advisor.

2381
02:10:47,110 --> 02:10:48,690
I lost all my men because of her!

2382
02:10:48,770 --> 02:10:52,350
And I lost over 70,000 people, including the president, because of Simmons.

2383
02:10:52,570 --> 02:10:53,350
Not the president.

2384
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:00,540
Oh, she's working for Neo-Umbrella.

2385
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:01,620
You know what that means?

2386
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:02,540
Yeah.

2387
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:03,800
Not an umbrella.

2388
02:11:05,120 --> 02:11:07,240
And you're still going to protect this woman?

2389
02:11:08,640 --> 02:11:10,320
Leon, you simp?

2390
02:11:10,460 --> 02:11:11,200
I am.

2391
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:15,560
It's true love.

2392
02:11:15,760 --> 02:11:16,280
It is.

2393
02:11:16,300 --> 02:11:18,800
He will even be evil for her.

2394
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:19,680
Yeah!

2395
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:21,780
Evil Leon arc!

2396
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:23,660
Yeah!

2397
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:32,140
She's so hot and she knows it.

2398
02:11:32,200 --> 02:11:34,120
Oh, not the grenade, no!

2399
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:36,260
Oh.

2400
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:47,300
It's so cool.

2401
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:47,920
Freeze!

2402
02:11:50,740 --> 02:11:51,560
Damn it!

2403
02:11:51,560 --> 02:11:52,360
My ears.

2404
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:54,460
My eyes.

2405
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:55,140
My eyes.

2406
02:11:55,260 --> 02:11:56,220
He's gonna kill her.

2407
02:11:57,940 --> 02:11:58,120
Chris!

2408
02:11:59,920 --> 02:12:00,340
Chris!

2409
02:12:00,520 --> 02:12:02,000
We both want the same thing here.

2410
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,100
Ada?

2411
02:12:04,600 --> 02:12:05,360
All right.

2412
02:12:06,240 --> 02:12:07,580
The BSA will handle Ada.

2413
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:09,400
You take care of Simmons.

2414
02:12:09,660 --> 02:12:09,940
Yeah.

2415
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:12,240
Come with us, Chris.

2416
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:13,660
Chris!

2417
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:13,800
Chris!

2418
02:12:13,820 --> 02:12:18,320
I know you'll do the right thing

2419
02:12:22,760 --> 02:12:24,760
Are you sure we can rely on him?

2420
02:12:25,560 --> 02:12:29,560
He's been in this as long as I have Longer?

2421
02:12:29,940 --> 02:12:30,140
No.

2422
02:12:32,080 --> 02:12:32,760
I don't know.

2423
02:12:32,980 --> 02:12:33,660
I guess so.

2424
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:40,280
If we're talking release date Is Chris the first one?

2425
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:41,820
I don't know, actually.

2426
02:12:43,280 --> 02:12:43,680
Chat.

2427
02:12:43,820 --> 02:12:46,940
We need the lore.

2428
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:47,440
Yeah.

2429
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:49,680
Leon, Helena, come in.

2430
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:50,940
Technically, yeah.

2431
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,940
If Sherry's intel is on the money, Simmons should be just up ahead.

2432
02:12:54,280 --> 02:12:54,800
Be careful.

2433
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:57,880
Oh, we're almost to Simmons?

2434
02:12:58,000 --> 02:12:58,800
That's so exciting.

2435
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:00,100
Oh.

2436
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,020
Now we get, we getting ammo.

2437
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:05,400
Yeah, baby.

2438
02:13:05,660 --> 02:13:07,000
I hope you made the right choice, Chris.

2439
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:09,260
What's going on?

2440
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:10,220
What am I looking at?

2441
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:13,160
What are you looking at?

2442
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:45,020

2443
02:13:45,640 --> 02:13:48,060
I can't remember how many everybody said.

2444
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:51,420
I thought five.

2445
02:13:55,260 --> 02:13:56,380
But I don't remember.

2446
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,480
Whoa, whoa, cinematic!

2447
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:00,280
Oh yeah!

2448
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:03,160
Cinema, I got to see a pretty...

2449
02:14:03,160 --> 02:14:04,780
A whole load of booty.

2450
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:09,800
So what?

2451
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:12,360
I have Helena.

2452
02:14:13,840 --> 02:14:16,000
Oh yeah, she's got a nice bond.

2453
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:19,280
That's true.

2454
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:23,140
I like that her tank top is exposing a little bit of her midriff.

2455
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:27,040
He's got, like, the Matrix agents with him.

2456
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:31,680
No, wait.

2457
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:35,240
Ah, Agent Birkin, impeccable timing.

2458
02:14:35,380 --> 02:14:37,640
Kindly take these two into custody, won't you?

2459
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,860
They said you were involved in the terrorist attack.

2460
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:40,880
Is it true?

2461
02:14:41,420 --> 02:14:41,900
What?

2462
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:45,060
Are they running down the street, screaming it to anyone who listens?

2463
02:14:47,240 --> 02:14:50,880
It's for the benefit of the United States and global security.

2464
02:14:50,940 --> 02:14:53,520
You can't see how killing the president is good for the country.

2465
02:14:53,760 --> 02:14:54,080
Oh.

2466
02:14:54,700 --> 02:14:55,820
The president's dead?

2467
02:14:56,020 --> 02:14:58,300
Well, we had Leon to thank for that.

2468
02:14:58,360 --> 02:14:59,460
Where's his zombies?

2469
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:01,600
Dispose of them.

2470
02:15:05,380 --> 02:15:05,860
Matrix.

2471
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:10,360
What are you going to do, shield them from the pool?

2472
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:11,080
What is it?

2473
02:15:12,040 --> 02:15:13,080
Hold your fire.

2474
02:15:13,760 --> 02:15:15,660
Those two are still of use to us.

2475
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:18,760
You need to be more careful.

2476
02:15:18,840 --> 02:15:19,240
Yeah.

2477
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:22,860
We shoot them.

2478
02:15:22,960 --> 02:15:23,900
You think you can make it to that door?

2479
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,280
Why don't we just waste them?

2480
02:15:26,500 --> 02:15:27,960
Because I need you to take care of Sherry.

2481
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,540
Can we wrap this up?

2482
02:15:30,920 --> 02:15:32,280
I do have better things to do.

2483
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:33,300
What are you two gonna do?

2484
02:15:33,620 --> 02:15:34,180
Finish Simmons.

2485
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:36,600
Shoot him.

2486
02:15:37,680 --> 02:15:40,340
There's information on here that could stop the sea virus.

2487
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:44,860
Well, I'm not gonna give it to him.

2488
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,440

Is that fatal?

2505
02:18:38,050 --> 02:18:39,290
But don't worry.

2506
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:47,740
Okay.

2507
02:18:47,740 --> 02:18:50,100
Whoever this is is sounding pretty villainous.

2508
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:52,180
We've got you.

2509
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:58,360
She got that evil, sultry boy.

2510
02:18:58,860 --> 02:18:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

2511
02:18:59,620 --> 02:19:01,140
That woman is on the loose.

2512
02:19:02,100 --> 02:19:02,480
What woman?

2513
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:05,240
That traitor, Ada Wong.

2514
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:08,200
Who knows what she's got in store.

2515
02:19:08,700 --> 02:19:10,120
Another team was sent after her.

2516
02:19:11,060 --> 02:19:11,680
You Simmons?

2517
02:19:12,700 --> 02:19:13,580
You're all ours.

2518
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:46,880
to avenge the president is that it you fool just push him off don't let him do his monologue so i always make that mistake or always listening to the monologue so to avoid one possible disaster you create another no matter how many people die he had to be stopped he was leading my country and this world it's a complete this is a chaos it seems pretty chaotic to me How dare she do this to me?

2519
02:19:47,900 --> 02:19:49,140
Taste of your own medicine.

2520
02:19:50,300 --> 02:19:53,300
We should get him before he gains his ring.

2521
02:19:53,620 --> 02:19:54,760
Oh, no, it's a ring!

2522
02:19:55,940 --> 02:19:56,080
Oh.

2523
02:19:56,660 --> 02:19:56,960
Oh.

2524
02:19:58,620 --> 02:19:59,840
Oh, my God.

2525
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:01,360
He's poking out.

2526
02:20:01,440 --> 02:20:03,400
He looks like a character from Metal Gear.

2527
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:04,600
Oh, not so much anymore.

2528
02:20:04,820 --> 02:20:05,840
Oh, my God!

2529
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:09,660
Yeah, we should have shot him way earlier.

2530
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:12,420
Oh, my God.

2531
02:20:15,100 --> 02:20:17,180
He's the reverse Pokemon evolution.

2532
02:20:17,460 --> 02:20:17,880
Wait, oh, V?

2533
02:20:18,380 --> 02:20:18,640
Ah!

2534
02:20:18,980 --> 02:20:20,040
What did he just say, V for?

2535
02:20:20,860 --> 02:20:22,580
Oh, why did I just do that?

2536
02:20:22,680 --> 02:20:23,120
So sorry.

2537
02:20:23,380 --> 02:20:24,440
I'm going to go salmon.

2538
02:20:25,080 --> 02:20:26,180
Yeah, do it, do it.

2539
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:27,440
Hope for the best.

2540
02:20:30,100 --> 02:20:30,980
Oh, he's a person again.

2541
02:20:31,320 --> 02:20:31,660
Yeah.

2542
02:20:33,620 --> 02:20:34,820
Okay, are we running?

2543
02:20:35,180 --> 02:20:36,000
Wait, what just happened?

2544
02:20:36,600 --> 02:20:37,280
I don't know.

2545
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:38,660
I thought we were going to kill him.

2546
02:20:41,880 --> 02:20:43,060
He's a shapeshifter.

2547
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:45,680
Oh my gosh.

2548
02:20:47,840 --> 02:20:51,420
I hope you were hurting me, otherwise I just wasted my...

2549
02:20:51,420 --> 02:20:52,480
You're just stabbing him!

2550
02:20:52,940 --> 02:20:53,760
Take him out!

2551
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:54,360
I'm getting him!

2552
02:20:54,400 --> 02:20:55,020
Take him out!

2553
02:20:58,980 --> 02:20:59,940
This works!

2554
02:21:02,720 --> 02:21:05,140
Ouch, ow, he stepped on me, oh no!

2555
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:08,240
Uh-oh.

2556
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:09,180
You're in.

2557
02:21:09,180 --> 02:21:10,160
I'm okay, I'm okay.

2558
02:21:10,440 --> 02:21:10,700
Yeah?

2559
02:21:10,740 --> 02:21:11,620
I'm gonna get him.

2560
02:21:11,740 --> 02:21:13,260
I'm just gonna...

2561
02:21:13,260 --> 02:21:13,940
Take your time.

2562
02:21:14,160 --> 02:21:14,960
Take your time, you know?

2563
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:15,900
Oh!

2564
02:21:16,220 --> 02:21:16,260
Oh!

2565
02:21:17,180 --> 02:21:17,440
No!

2566
02:21:17,560 --> 02:21:18,060
Did I die?

2567
02:21:18,660 --> 02:21:19,080
No!

2568
02:21:19,300 --> 02:21:19,680
It's okay.

2569
02:21:19,820 --> 02:21:20,600
I think it was a checkpoint.

2570
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:24,400
But I was just on the floor.

2571
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:26,120
I'm gonna grenade.

2572
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:30,580
That's a good idea.

2573
02:21:31,640 --> 02:21:32,160
Oh, okay.

2574
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:32,760
Let's get some distance.

2575
02:21:33,060 --> 02:21:33,740
We have the chance.

2576
02:21:35,080 --> 02:21:36,280
Oh, damn you.

2577
02:21:36,520 --> 02:21:37,360
Damn you both.

2578
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:38,660
This again.

2579
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:38,880
Yeah.

2580
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:42,000
Maybe I can play on the flip.

2581
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:43,920
But it was pretty fun.

2582
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:45,660
No.

2583
02:21:46,300 --> 02:21:46,640
No.

2584
02:21:46,660 --> 02:21:46,920
Nice.

2585
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:47,860
Oh.

2586
02:21:50,970 --> 02:21:51,490
Oh.

2587
02:21:51,870 --> 02:21:52,250
Yeah, yeah.

2588
02:21:52,430 --> 02:21:53,210
I'm gonna...

2589
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:54,770
I'll just heal this time.

2590
02:21:55,830 --> 02:21:57,450
I'm gonna let him come over to me.

2591
02:22:01,900 --> 02:22:03,940
Come on, keep walking, keep walking.

2592
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:05,800
You're right on top of a bomb.

2593
02:22:09,890 --> 02:22:11,070
I gotta get him.

2594
02:22:11,590 --> 02:22:12,550
Why did I do that?

2595
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:16,150
Okay.

2596
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:17,550
Free ammo?

2597
02:22:19,610 --> 02:22:21,350
Oh, I can't hold.

2598
02:22:22,430 --> 02:22:23,330
Wait, wait, don't go away.

2599
02:22:23,350 --> 02:22:25,450
I just put that there.

2600
02:22:27,310 --> 02:22:28,210
He leave?

2601
02:22:28,670 --> 02:22:29,790
Yeah, he left.

2602
02:22:30,190 --> 02:22:31,350
Oh, free ammo.

2603
02:22:39,020 --> 02:22:39,540
Um...

2604
02:22:39,540 --> 02:22:40,080
Oh!

2605
02:22:42,140 --> 02:22:42,660
Ouch!

2606
02:22:56,550 --> 02:22:57,690
He's man-mode!

2607
02:22:59,530 --> 02:23:00,050
Oh.

2608
02:23:01,090 --> 02:23:02,290
Yeah, the unload item!

2609
02:23:02,470 --> 02:23:03,410
I wish he would come closer.

2610
02:23:04,170 --> 02:23:04,650
Dang it.

2611
02:23:04,690 --> 02:23:05,670
Sorry, I totally missed it.

2612
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:06,610
I totally fumbled that.

2613
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:07,310
No, that's okay.

2614
02:23:07,450 --> 02:23:08,690
I fumbled that so hard.

2615
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:11,130
Oh,

2616
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:17,050
here we go.

2617
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:21,150
And...

2618
02:23:21,150 --> 02:23:21,490
Oops.

2619
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:23,190
That hurt me a little more.

2620
02:23:23,310 --> 02:23:23,570
Oh, wait.

2621
02:23:24,390 --> 02:23:25,190
Did I shoot you?

2622
02:23:25,890 --> 02:23:26,350
Oh, nice!

2623
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:26,650
No!

2624
02:23:27,050 --> 02:23:28,350
Punch in his ass!

2625
02:23:28,790 --> 02:23:29,250
Yeah!

2626
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:31,830
Oh, yeah!

2627
02:23:32,330 --> 02:23:33,490
Feel my fury.

2628
02:23:34,370 --> 02:23:35,190
Oh, okay.

2629
02:23:38,610 --> 02:23:39,410
And beep.

2630
02:23:40,030 --> 02:23:41,130
And come back up.

2631
02:23:41,210 --> 02:23:42,490
Come over here, please, sir.

2632
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:43,630
Never mind.

2633
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:44,430
Oh, he's going up.

2634
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:44,990
No!

2635
02:23:45,310 --> 02:23:46,570
I wish I could pick it back up.

2636
02:23:50,470 --> 02:23:54,490
I think he, like, comes through maybe on the other side.

2637
02:23:54,810 --> 02:23:55,150
Oh, yeah.

2638
02:23:56,430 --> 02:23:57,850
Run back through the train.

2639
02:23:58,210 --> 02:23:59,130
Yeah, I'm gonna reload.

2640
02:24:02,630 --> 02:24:03,130
Oh.

2641
02:24:04,190 --> 02:24:05,270
How do we get up top?

2642
02:24:05,890 --> 02:24:07,250
I just sprayed myself.

2643
02:24:09,490 --> 02:24:10,490
That's fine.

2644
02:24:12,390 --> 02:24:12,670
Hello.

2645
02:24:13,010 --> 02:24:13,670
I think he's over here.

2646
02:24:13,950 --> 02:24:15,610
He's gonna hop through here, I think.

2647
02:24:16,150 --> 02:24:16,470
Okay.

2648
02:24:16,770 --> 02:24:17,010
Maybe?

2649
02:24:17,550 --> 02:24:18,990
I know there's an opening here, no?

2650
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,590
Oh, wait.

2651
02:24:20,890 --> 02:24:21,670
Oh, he's on the other side.

2652
02:24:21,930 --> 02:24:23,070
Oh, I can lift you.

2653
02:24:23,290 --> 02:24:24,030
Oh, you can, okay.

2654
02:24:24,410 --> 02:24:24,950
Over here!

2655
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:25,550
Okay.

2656
02:24:25,870 --> 02:24:28,030
Yeah, because he's just, like, chilling up on the roof.

2657
02:24:38,800 --> 02:24:39,740
Oh, he's coming!

2658
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:40,460
Oh,

2659
02:24:47,650 --> 02:24:48,090
he's...

2660
02:24:48,090 --> 02:24:49,150
I don't know.

2661
02:24:49,930 --> 02:24:51,610
I want to stab him.

2662
02:24:51,670 --> 02:24:51,830
Wait.

2663
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:53,790
Did he kill him?

2664
02:24:53,930 --> 02:24:54,790
Wait, was that it?

2665
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:56,550
He dropped bullets.

2666
02:24:56,830 --> 02:24:57,170
He's dead.

2667
02:24:57,390 --> 02:24:57,970
He dropped bullets!

2668
02:24:59,610 --> 02:25:00,290
Oh!

2669
02:25:00,610 --> 02:25:01,350
Oh, Leon!

2670
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:07,340
Oh no.

2671
02:25:08,600 --> 02:25:10,340
He's even bigger.

2672
02:25:11,220 --> 02:25:12,120
Oh my god.

2673
02:25:15,930 --> 02:25:17,330
Yeah, I keep him occupied.

2674
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:26,150
Oh, is that a QTE?

2675
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:27,190
Leon!

2676
02:25:28,250 --> 02:25:33,070
I wasn't fast enough.

2677
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:36,690
Okay, I gotta keep him really busy.

2678
02:25:37,530 --> 02:25:37,970
Okay, I'm gonna...

2679
02:25:37,970 --> 02:25:39,630
I'll remember to run this time.

2680
02:25:39,730 --> 02:25:40,470
I'll grenade him.

02:25:47,070 --> 02:26:16,410

Maybe your stressful part is coming.

2683
02:26:21,510 --> 02:26:21,750
Yeah.

2684
02:26:22,050 --> 02:26:22,170
Up next.

2685
02:26:22,930 --> 02:26:24,010
It's my turn.

2686
02:26:24,810 --> 02:26:25,510
Your turn.

2687
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:32,230
Should I be hitting him?

2688
02:26:33,530 --> 02:26:38,050
What are we aiming for?

2689
02:26:38,970 --> 02:26:40,610
Oh, wait, there was a thing?

2690
02:26:41,790 --> 02:26:42,090
I think.

2691
02:26:42,770 --> 02:26:43,210
I don't know.

2692
02:26:43,430 --> 02:26:43,830
I thought I...

2693
02:26:44,510 --> 02:26:45,170
He's got me!

2694
02:26:46,270 --> 02:26:46,750
I'll just...

2695
02:26:46,750 --> 02:26:46,990
Oh.

2696
02:26:48,490 --> 02:26:49,390
He hurts.

2697
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:50,850
Oh, you can take cover.

2698
02:26:51,330 --> 02:26:52,150
Yeah, I think...

2699
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,290
Oh.

2700
02:26:53,270 --> 02:26:55,330
You can't tell what to aim for.

2701
02:26:55,610 --> 02:26:56,170
The brain?

2702
02:26:56,310 --> 02:26:57,310
What's the brain?

2703
02:26:57,870 --> 02:26:58,710
Their brain?

2704
02:26:59,170 --> 02:27:00,450
Is that that part at the top?

2705
02:27:00,690 --> 02:27:01,530
You can't tell.

2706
02:27:01,890 --> 02:27:03,010
I'm like looking at him.

2707
02:27:03,130 --> 02:27:03,870
Oh, maybe even...

2708
02:27:03,870 --> 02:27:04,010
Oh.

2709
02:27:04,190 --> 02:27:04,810
Oh, take cover!

2710
02:27:10,450 --> 02:27:11,770
Just shoot again.

2711
02:27:12,610 --> 02:27:12,810
Oh.

2712
02:27:13,750 --> 02:27:14,190
Oh.

2713
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:14,610
Oh, ew, ew.

2714
02:27:15,150 --> 02:27:15,610
Oh!

2715
02:27:17,110 --> 02:27:17,970
Holy cow.

2716
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:18,450
Oh.

2717
02:27:20,110 --> 02:27:21,470
Oh, he's swimming in.

2718
02:27:21,550 --> 02:27:22,670
Oh, that's the brain.

2719
02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:23,450
It's got a face.

2720
02:27:23,790 --> 02:27:24,170
That's the brain.

2721
02:27:25,010 --> 02:27:25,570
That's the brain.

2722
02:27:26,470 --> 02:27:29,510
I always have my hands off the controller with the cursor.

2723
02:27:33,710 --> 02:27:34,450
Who's that arrived?

2724
02:27:38,530 --> 02:27:38,970
Oh.

2725
02:27:41,130 --> 02:27:41,570
Oh.

2726
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:43,090
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2727
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:44,410
He's throwing a minute train.

2728
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:48,230
I can't tell when it's another cutscene and when we're gonna start doing stuff.

2729
02:27:48,470 --> 02:28:04,450
like it's so when do we start playing oh my gosh wait oh what happened I think we brought it oh perfect aim

2730
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:17,420
dang he's so cool though I know he should be grateful for this right it turns him into a beast

2731
02:28:23,010 --> 02:28:29,810
do something thing you guys there's something keep keep showing

2732
02:28:34,750 --> 02:28:45,410
the world will be a better place so cool

2733
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:05,320
right in between the eyes let's go baby That was a good one.

2734
02:29:10,140 --> 02:29:11,860
Leave him!

2735
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:13,180
Leave him!

2736
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:26,860
Who's controlling this train?

2737
02:29:29,640 --> 02:29:30,500
This

2738
02:29:34,070 --> 02:29:38,010
is the most action movie-oriented one.

2739
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:38,070
I know!

2740
02:29:38,570 --> 02:29:39,210
Seriously.

2741
02:29:40,870 --> 02:29:42,390
Holy moly.

2742
02:29:44,170 --> 02:29:45,510
Well, that guy's down.

2743
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:46,750
Wait, so was it?

2744
02:29:46,810 --> 02:29:48,890
Ada gonna be the final boss?

2745
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:49,690
Maybe.

2746
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:51,750
But then what about her story?

2747
02:29:52,030 --> 02:29:54,710
We just haven't heard her side of the story.

2748
02:29:54,830 --> 02:29:55,490
Yeah, sure.

2749
02:29:55,670 --> 02:29:57,370
I'm sure she's not evil.

2750
02:30:03,870 --> 02:30:04,310
Wow.

2751
02:30:06,930 --> 02:30:11,930
I just put it together that this is the game right before Resident Evil 7.

2752
02:30:12,270 --> 02:30:13,950
Which is like a crazy jump.

2753
02:30:14,330 --> 02:30:15,230
Yes, there is.

2754
02:30:15,370 --> 02:30:15,930
It is.

2755
02:30:15,950 --> 02:30:17,930
A crazy jump.

2756
02:30:19,050 --> 02:30:19,730
I don't know.

2757
02:30:20,750 --> 02:30:21,670
But we did what we could.

2758
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:23,210
We got sliced and diced.

2759
02:30:23,890 --> 02:30:24,450
Why the trap?

2760
02:30:25,970 --> 02:30:27,270
They're so tired.

2761
02:30:27,430 --> 02:30:28,190
Can we take a nap?

2762
02:30:29,610 --> 02:30:29,990
Uh-oh.

2763
02:30:30,170 --> 02:30:30,930
Who's there?

2764
02:30:31,150 --> 02:30:36,110
I think there's like military men who will control us.

2765
02:30:37,430 --> 02:30:39,410
Maybe they have a spray for us.

2766
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:39,850
Yeah,

2767
02:30:49,360 --> 02:30:52,040
well, how long was it between this game and 7?

2768
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:55,360
Because I remember seeing this game a long, long time ago.

2769
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:56,680
And then 7 was...

2770
02:30:57,460 --> 02:30:57,940
What?

2771
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,240
I don't know anymore.

2772
02:31:00,660 --> 02:31:01,180
I don't know.

2773
02:31:01,780 --> 02:31:08,220
I feel like it came out not so long ago, but someone's going to be like, it came out 10 years ago and I'm going to be...

2774
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:09,360
Five years?

2775
02:31:09,740 --> 02:31:11,380
2012 and 2017?

2776
02:31:12,320 --> 02:31:13,720
It's a pretty big gap.

2777
02:31:13,960 --> 02:31:14,300
Yeah.

2778
02:31:14,980 --> 02:31:17,160
I just said, yeah, at the same time as Lillian.

2779
02:31:18,560 --> 02:31:19,860
You're in sync.

2780
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:22,140
Leon, we have a situation.

2781
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:24,360
Sherry and her companion were abducted.

2782
02:31:24,520 --> 02:31:25,080
Oh no.

2783
02:31:25,700 --> 02:31:26,180
Uh-oh.

2784
02:31:28,760 --> 02:32:00,560
abducted and why why he sounds so sad he loves her doesn't he no this is trish no was that was that her name is the key to stopping the sea virus it's on the phone does he love sherry or does he love ada i feel like he loves both why did i say trish i meant sherry i'm really sorry i'm bad with names we do New Resident Evil OC.

2785
02:32:01,020 --> 02:32:02,440
Yeah, it just made her up.

2786
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:03,920
Chris Redfield.

2787
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:06,020
Leon, where are you?

2788
02:32:06,180 --> 02:32:07,760
Chris, we're just outside of Tachi.

2789
02:32:08,600 --> 02:32:09,680
Get the hell out of there!

2790
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:10,540
Uh-oh.

2791
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:11,940
They're gonna blow it up!

2792
02:32:12,160 --> 02:32:12,580
Oh!

2793
02:32:14,140 --> 02:32:15,400
Oh, they are!

2794
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:16,800
That's so sad.

2795
02:32:16,820 --> 02:32:17,360
No!

2796
02:32:17,900 --> 02:32:19,740
They said no sea virus here!

2797
02:32:20,300 --> 02:32:20,880
No!

2798
02:32:27,430 --> 02:32:28,750
Oh my gosh.

2799
02:32:29,030 --> 02:32:29,390
Oh.

2800
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:40,020
That's sad.

2801
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:42,040
We did that.

2802
02:32:44,380 --> 02:32:46,220
It's just a lot of smoke, though, right?

2803
02:32:47,580 --> 02:32:47,900
Oh, wait.

2804
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,120
Is it the zombie smoke?

2805
02:32:50,040 --> 02:32:51,120
Oh, it might be.

2806
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,280
Why are they doing this?

2807
02:32:53,420 --> 02:32:54,220
Why are they...

2808
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:58,500
They're purposefully turning everyone into zombies.

2809
02:32:58,800 --> 02:32:59,060
No!

2810
02:33:00,560 --> 02:33:02,260
But Simmons is dead.

2811
02:33:02,540 --> 02:33:04,060
So who gave the order?

2812
02:33:05,240 --> 02:33:07,440
Dun, dun, dun.

2813
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:14,250
I'm like,

2814
02:33:21,940 --> 02:33:22,480
for anybody.

2815
02:33:23,540 --> 02:33:24,280
I don't know.

2816
02:33:24,740 --> 02:33:26,840
Maybe I just don't have the political mind.

2817
02:33:26,980 --> 02:33:27,600
That's the search.

2818
02:33:27,900 --> 02:33:28,280
Watch this.

2819
02:33:30,180 --> 02:33:31,880
Oh, there's S-Rank.

2820
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,660
I got an S-Rank.

2821
02:33:33,920 --> 02:33:34,860
Oh, my gosh.

2822
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:35,460
Whoa.

2823
02:33:41,170 --> 02:33:41,730
Wow.

2824
02:33:42,050 --> 02:33:42,750
We didn't...

2825
02:33:42,750 --> 02:33:45,510
How did we kill hardly any enemies?

2826
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:46,270
I was just...

2827
02:33:46,270 --> 02:33:46,910
Yeah, enemies.

2828
02:33:47,110 --> 02:34:23,690
Maybe those guys that kept respawning they didn't actually die oh i guess so i guess that was mostly it yeah your accuracy too mine's going lower though it's okay where you're still gaming you don't need accuracy you have the knife oh i can't i can't afford knife level three though i'm gonna upgrade the critical hit level two But now I need to save for everything else.

2829
02:34:26,190 --> 02:34:27,910
I know everything's so expensive.

2830
02:34:28,950 --> 02:34:29,190
Yeah!

2831
02:34:33,320 --> 02:34:36,040
I'm trying to wonder if I don't want Eagle Eye anymore.

2832
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:41,360
Arrow pickup increase?

2833
02:34:43,880 --> 02:34:44,560
What increase?

2834
02:34:45,660 --> 02:34:46,080
Arrow?

2835
02:34:46,800 --> 02:34:48,280
There's a bow and arrow?

2836
02:34:48,580 --> 02:34:50,140
Oh, there's a bow and arrow!

2837
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:51,600
Apparently.

2838
02:34:55,160 --> 02:35:05,600
I'll just I'll keep it as is I suppose You can't record anything good There's a general item drop increase?

2839
02:35:05,740 --> 02:35:07,800
Would that apply to both of us?

2840
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:10,700
Oh, it's on Ada.

2841
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:11,700
I think it's just one.

2842
02:35:12,920 --> 02:35:13,260
Okay.

2843
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:18,700

2844
02:35:19,300 --> 02:35:23,460

Final chapter!

2853
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:17,220
Oh my gosh.

2854
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:18,840
What's gonna happen?

2855
02:36:19,020 --> 02:36:19,300
Leon!

2856
02:36:21,580 --> 02:36:23,060
So that's Chris.

2857
02:36:23,240 --> 02:36:24,320
Yeah, that's Chris.

2858
02:36:25,980 --> 02:36:26,700
Oh gosh.

2859
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:28,560
Oh yeah, that's pretty bad.

2860
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:29,740
It's real bad.

2861
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:45,600
it almost sounded like the wilhelm spring that's what i was thinking i was literally thinking that ah i need to get that as a sound board no that'd be so good

2862
02:36:49,800 --> 02:37:03,360
it was wait it actually was even they could just cut it cut it a little short it takes me out every time i hear it in a serious context Lord of the Rings.

2863
02:37:03,940 --> 02:37:05,900
Wait, where is it in Lord of the Rings?

2864
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:08,720
I used it like three times in the Lord of the Rings.

2865
02:37:08,960 --> 02:37:09,100
Why?

2866
02:37:10,220 --> 02:37:12,760
It's like such a serious...

2867
02:37:12,760 --> 02:37:13,960
Ada Wong is dead!

2868
02:37:14,040 --> 02:37:14,260
What?

2869
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:16,840
No, your girl is dead.

2870
02:37:19,320 --> 02:37:19,720
No.

2871
02:37:20,080 --> 02:37:20,660
Maybe it's...

2872
02:37:20,660 --> 02:37:21,440
Maybe she's not.

2873
02:37:21,580 --> 02:37:22,780
Maybe it's the fake Ada.

2874
02:37:23,140 --> 02:37:23,940
Don't let him down.

2875
02:37:24,140 --> 02:37:25,200
Don't cry, Leon.

2876
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:26,100
Don't cry.

2877
02:37:26,860 --> 02:37:27,360
Are you okay?

2878
02:37:28,540 --> 02:37:29,540
She's so pretty.

2879
02:37:30,460 --> 02:37:30,840
I know.

2880
02:37:30,940 --> 02:37:33,020
Let's just find the survivors and get the hell out of here.

2881
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:34,520
drivers.

2882
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:37,040
That's optimistic.

2883
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:37,720
Can you read me?

2884
02:37:38,240 --> 02:37:38,700
I know.

2885
02:37:39,260 --> 02:37:40,100
HQ to Echo.

2886
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:44,820
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing over there?

2887
02:37:45,540 --> 02:37:45,720
Oh.

2888
02:37:45,720 --> 02:37:46,340
We need to evacuate.

2889
02:37:46,580 --> 02:37:47,040
Come on.

2890
02:37:47,180 --> 02:37:47,520
Okay.

2891
02:37:48,340 --> 02:37:50,240
This guy's gonna...

2892
02:37:50,240 --> 02:37:51,160
Who is this cover us?

2893
02:37:51,240 --> 02:37:52,160
He's gonna cover us.

2894
02:37:52,900 --> 02:37:53,040
Oh.

2895
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:54,940
We're moving in to search for surviving evacuees.

2896
02:37:56,120 --> 02:37:56,440
Wait.

2897
02:37:56,680 --> 02:37:57,640
Where do they even go?

2898
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:58,920
Don't go there.

2899
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:01,280
We want to help.

2900
02:38:01,760 --> 02:38:02,800
Yeah, we want to help.

2901
02:38:08,180 --> 02:38:11,680
Oh no, you guys are all doomed, sorry to say.

2902
02:38:11,980 --> 02:38:13,160
Oh no, don't breathe the blue.

2903
02:38:13,360 --> 02:38:13,920
It's the gap.

2904
02:38:14,580 --> 02:38:15,120
It's the...

2905
02:38:15,120 --> 02:38:15,460
Oh, wait.

2906
02:38:15,720 --> 02:38:15,960
Oh, we're good.

2907
02:38:15,980 --> 02:38:17,000
No, don't run that.

2908
02:38:17,060 --> 02:38:18,060
Don't run in there.

2909
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:18,580
No!

2910
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:20,700
Don't go near the gas.

2911
02:38:24,940 --> 02:38:25,900
I'm sorry.

2912
02:38:25,940 --> 02:38:27,620
They are covering us.

2913
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:28,440
Are they really?

2914
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:29,740
Wait, I was just looking around.

2915
02:38:30,520 --> 02:38:30,620
Oh.

2916
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:32,700
Holina.

2917
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:33,600
I'm coming.

2918
02:38:34,020 --> 02:38:34,500
Holina.

2919
02:38:36,280 --> 02:38:37,900
I'm protecting the people!

2920
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:39,280
Oh, I'm near the gash.

2921
02:38:40,700 --> 02:38:42,680
Okay, oh, okay, sorry, sorry.

2922
02:38:42,800 --> 02:38:43,760
I'm protecting the people.

2923
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:46,100
I'm protecting the people.

2924
02:38:47,020 --> 02:38:47,120
Okay.

2925
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:49,260
Ada's dead!

2926
02:38:51,270 --> 02:38:52,050
Banners anymore!

2927
02:38:58,990 --> 02:39:00,930
The gash looks so pretty, though.

2928
02:39:00,990 --> 02:39:02,390
That could be blue raspberry.

2929
02:39:05,450 --> 02:39:06,270
Oh, gosh.

2930
02:39:06,490 --> 02:39:07,430
Where do we go?

2931
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:08,870
I'm following the guy.

2932
02:39:09,550 --> 02:39:09,710
Oh!

2933
02:39:09,930 --> 02:39:10,150
Oh!

2934
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:10,690
Wait, we just...

2935
02:39:10,710 --> 02:39:11,450
What just happened to me?

2936
02:39:12,110 --> 02:39:12,550
Uh-oh.

2937
02:39:13,150 --> 02:39:14,910
Wait, I thought we were immune to the gas!

2938
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,670
I thought so too!

2939
02:39:17,730 --> 02:39:18,170
Whoa.

2940
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:19,310
What's happening?

2941
02:39:20,030 --> 02:39:20,470
Metallic.

2942
02:39:20,730 --> 02:39:20,890
What?

2943
02:39:22,370 --> 02:39:22,810
That was like...

2944
02:39:22,810 --> 02:39:23,970
Yeah, why was I...

2945
02:39:23,970 --> 02:39:24,610
Like...

2946
02:39:24,610 --> 02:39:25,170
That was like...

2947
02:39:25,170 --> 02:39:25,550
Chrome.

2948
02:39:27,230 --> 02:39:28,110
Special edition.

2949
02:39:33,090 --> 02:39:33,970
What the...

2950
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:35,890
Freezing in the chemicals.

2951
02:39:36,410 --> 02:39:37,230
Oh, it's a time...

2952
02:39:37,230 --> 02:39:37,730
It's a...

2953
02:39:37,730 --> 02:39:38,650
Oh, we're back here.

2954
02:39:38,730 --> 02:39:38,850
Okay.

2955
02:39:39,170 --> 02:39:41,490
Again, apparently it's a fight against time.

2956
02:39:41,650 --> 02:39:42,390
So we just gotta run for it.

2957
02:39:42,390 --> 02:39:42,810
Oh, okay.

2958
02:39:43,370 --> 02:39:44,850
And I just sat...

2959
02:39:44,850 --> 02:39:45,290
Wait, which way?

2960
02:39:45,850 --> 02:39:48,170
Wait, I'm going the wrong way, aren't I?

2961
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:50,690
Oh wait, I might have doomed us.

2962
02:39:53,030 --> 02:39:54,370
I'm going, I'm going!

2963
02:39:56,030 --> 02:39:56,890
This way!

2964
02:39:57,650 --> 02:39:58,650
I'm here, I'm here!

2965
02:40:00,990 --> 02:40:03,050
Okay, and then I think we go up here, right?

2966
02:40:03,570 --> 02:40:05,710
Oh yeah, yeah, in here.

2967
02:40:08,830 --> 02:40:09,310
Okay.

2968
02:40:09,770 --> 02:40:10,590
Shut the door?

2969
02:40:10,750 --> 02:40:12,110
Yeah, close the door!

2970
02:40:13,250 --> 02:40:13,710
Oh my god!

2971
02:40:15,550 --> 02:40:16,430
Ooh, close!

2972
02:40:17,090 --> 02:40:18,370
There's some herbs over here.

2973
02:40:19,950 --> 02:40:20,910
Yeah, there is.

2974
02:40:22,230 --> 02:40:24,130
Oh, I'm full of everything.

2975
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:24,590
Me too.

2976
02:40:24,810 --> 02:40:26,410
Wait, this box can also be open.

2977
02:40:27,170 --> 02:40:27,370
Oh!

2978
02:40:27,750 --> 02:40:29,090
Okay, we got him speed running for real.

2979
02:40:30,170 --> 02:40:30,330
Oh.

2980
02:40:30,990 --> 02:40:31,430
Okay.

2981
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:32,730
Oh, keep going, keep going!

2982
02:40:33,370 --> 02:40:33,430
Ah!

2983
02:40:34,570 --> 02:40:35,830
Oh my god, oh my god!

2984
02:40:35,990 --> 02:40:36,130
No!

2985
02:40:39,250 --> 02:40:40,610
Wait, we get to see?

2986
02:40:41,070 --> 02:40:41,510
Chrome.

2987
02:40:42,070 --> 02:40:42,290
Chrome.

2988
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:43,910
He's bald.

2989
02:40:44,350 --> 02:40:45,630
Wait, he's bald for you?

2990
02:40:46,110 --> 02:40:46,230
What?

2991
02:40:47,550 --> 02:40:49,290
I think he was bald.

2992
02:40:50,950 --> 02:40:52,630
His hair fell off.

2993
02:40:53,270 --> 02:40:54,050
Okay, we just got him.

2994
02:40:54,670 --> 02:40:55,410
Oh, we're here though.

2995
02:40:55,570 --> 02:40:56,010
This is fine.

2996
02:40:57,130 --> 02:40:58,350
Wait, I'm gonna grab the...

2997
02:40:58,930 --> 02:41:00,150
I don't think that's the half of it.

2998
02:41:00,430 --> 02:41:01,610
Grab the...

2999
02:41:01,610 --> 02:41:02,250
I'm greedy.

3000
02:41:02,470 --> 02:41:02,710
I'm greedy.

3001
02:41:02,950 --> 02:41:03,530
I'm sorry, everybody.

3002
02:41:03,690 --> 02:41:04,070
I'm greedy.

3003
02:41:04,390 --> 02:41:04,810
I'm so greedy.

3004
02:41:05,810 --> 02:41:07,570
Okay, let's just go upstairs again.

02:41:08,250 --> 02:41:08,690

Oh!

3008
02:41:11,150 --> 02:41:11,890
This is a gas.

It's not.

3014
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:46,550
It's just outside.

3015
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:47,270
It's not.

3016
02:41:48,970 --> 02:41:49,870

Oh.

02:41:52,350 --> 02:41:53,770
I'm just ignoring it.

3020
02:41:54,830 --> 02:41:55,410

Go!

3023
02:41:59,990 --> 02:42:00,010
Go!

3024
02:42:00,010 --> 02:42:00,630
Oh, it's the gas.

3025
02:42:00,790 --> 02:42:01,450
It's super gas.

3026
02:42:01,450 --> 02:42:01,690
Did I ride?

3027
02:42:03,430 --> 02:42:04,870
Oh, he's a hero!

3028
02:42:05,470 --> 02:42:06,270
He's a hero!

3029
02:42:06,690 --> 02:42:07,210
I know!

3030
02:42:07,650 --> 02:42:08,110
Oh my god!

3031
02:42:09,830 --> 02:42:10,510
Uh-oh.

3032
02:42:11,110 --> 02:42:11,590
Uh-oh.

3033
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:11,790
All right.

3034
02:42:12,170 --> 02:42:12,730
Hang on.

3035
02:42:12,930 --> 02:42:13,210
Okay.

3036
02:42:13,230 --> 02:42:14,950
Okay, is he gonna drive?

3037
02:42:15,110 --> 02:42:16,490
She was so cool.

3038
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:18,870
Turn that black eye AC.

3039
02:42:23,270 --> 02:42:28,310
Oh, passenger Princess Leon.

3040
02:42:29,090 --> 02:42:29,610
Yes.

3041
02:42:29,870 --> 02:42:31,410
HQ to Charlie, change of plans.

3042
02:42:32,390 --> 02:42:33,530
This guy's going so slow.

3043
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,970
He really is.

3044
02:42:35,010 --> 02:42:36,290
Well, honestly, that's smart.

3045
02:42:37,230 --> 02:42:39,950
Sometimes people drive too fast in the zombie apocalypse.

3046
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:40,510
That's true.

3047
02:42:40,550 --> 02:42:41,310
And then they crash.

3048
02:42:41,570 --> 02:42:42,510
He went over the edge.

3049
02:42:42,610 --> 02:42:44,450
It go down.

3050
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:49,770
This is the smoothest ride I've ever experienced.

3051
02:42:52,670 --> 02:42:53,090
What the?

3052
02:42:53,210 --> 02:42:54,450
How did that thing just explode?

3053
02:42:56,710 --> 02:42:58,990
Wait, I think he got run over by our tires.

3054
02:43:00,570 --> 02:43:00,910
Oh.

3055
02:43:01,450 --> 02:43:03,070
He's stopping at the stop sign.

3056
02:43:03,750 --> 02:43:04,670
He has good...

3057
02:43:04,670 --> 02:43:05,390
He is!

3058
02:43:07,090 --> 02:43:09,510
This is like an amusement park ride.

3059
02:43:09,970 --> 02:43:10,270
It is!

3060
02:43:11,510 --> 02:43:13,430
I like Red Disney.

3061
02:43:14,370 --> 02:43:14,870
He's so...

3062
02:43:14,890 --> 02:43:28,970
so polite he's considering like us being in the car with him yeah i mean it's this is the longest car ride we've had yeah like when i drove it we crashed in like five seconds so

02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:48,450
This is crazy.

3065
02:43:49,670 --> 02:43:51,350
I feel like he's vibing.

3066
02:43:51,690 --> 02:43:52,130
I'm vibing.

3067
02:43:52,150 --> 02:43:53,510
The AC is on.

3068
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:56,210
He's listening to his favorite music.

3069
02:43:59,550 --> 02:44:03,090
This is also like excessively long.

3070
02:44:03,830 --> 02:44:05,910
I kind of like it though.

3071
02:44:05,970 --> 02:44:07,050
Yeah, I love it.

3072
02:44:08,090 --> 02:44:10,900
Oh, the gas is so nice for like not...

3078
02:45:22,370 --> 02:45:23,290

Come on, Helena.

02:45:25,930 --> 02:45:26,450
Don't give up.

3081
02:45:26,730 --> 02:45:27,630
Yeah, Helena, give up.

3082
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:27,990
Okay.

3083
02:45:28,350 --> 02:45:36,830

3084
02:45:37,030 --> 02:45:37,290
I know.

3085
02:45:37,630 --> 02:45:40,090

02:45:40,970 --> 02:45:41,390
Yeah.

3087

02:46:53,910 --> 02:46:54,710
Do I know this guy?

3098
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:58,630

Yeah!

3105
02:47:09,210 --> 02:47:10,450
The prologue?

3106
02:47:10,990 --> 02:47:11,790
I think so.

3107
02:47:11,810 --> 02:47:12,390
It was foreshadowing.

3108
02:47:14,490 --> 02:47:14,810
Oh!

3109
02:47:16,010 --> 02:47:16,930
Shoot it.

3110
02:47:18,710 --> 02:47:19,250
That guy.

3111
02:47:19,870 --> 02:47:20,370
You missed.

3112
02:47:20,830 --> 02:47:20,910
I'm stuck.

3113
02:47:21,810 --> 02:47:21,950
Oh!

3114
02:47:22,290 --> 02:47:22,630
Oh!

3115
02:47:22,710 --> 02:47:22,910
Oh!

3116
02:47:22,910 --> 02:47:23,010
Oh!

3117
02:47:24,230 --> 02:47:24,690
Oh!

3118
02:47:24,690 --> 02:47:24,870
Oh!

3119
02:47:24,870 --> 02:47:24,910
Oh!

3120
02:47:27,970 --> 02:47:29,570
I'm stabbing him.

3121
02:47:31,430 --> 02:47:32,530
You got this good.

3122
02:47:32,770 --> 02:47:33,630
You got this good.

3123
02:47:37,850 --> 02:47:38,210
Yeah!

3124
02:47:38,470 --> 02:47:38,630
Yeah!

3125
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:40,750
Yeah!

3126
02:47:40,810 --> 02:47:42,970
You wanna upgrade to that melee.

3127
02:47:44,210 --> 02:47:45,570
That melee too?

3128
02:47:46,270 --> 02:47:46,810
Uh-huh!

3129
02:47:46,930 --> 02:47:48,390
That's that melee too!

3130
02:47:48,450 --> 02:47:48,650
Yeah!

3131
02:47:48,670 --> 02:47:50,110
Remember this is where we got them!

3132
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:51,830
Oh my gosh!

3133
02:47:52,110 --> 02:47:54,790
And this is where I was collapsed on the ground.

3134
02:47:55,770 --> 02:47:56,450
Yes, yes.

3135
02:47:57,090 --> 02:47:57,170
Yeah.

3136
02:47:58,050 --> 02:47:59,290
How did the prologue end?

3137
02:47:59,410 --> 02:47:59,890
I don't remember.

3138
02:48:01,930 --> 02:48:04,310
Um, I don't remember either.

3139
02:48:05,310 --> 02:48:07,270
It was so long ago.

3140
02:48:07,690 --> 02:48:08,290
Last week.

3141
02:48:09,090 --> 02:48:09,510
Ah!

3142
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:10,450
Ah!

3143
02:48:11,010 --> 02:48:11,410
Ah!

3144
02:48:12,530 --> 02:48:15,070
Sorry, I'm picking herbs.

3145
02:48:15,190 --> 02:48:16,390
Um, don't worry about it.

3146
02:48:17,450 --> 02:48:18,050
Are you okay?

3147
02:48:19,350 --> 02:48:20,030
Oh!

3148
02:48:20,270 --> 02:48:21,270
Wait, wait, wait.

3149
02:48:21,490 --> 02:48:22,230
I'm gonna throw a grenade.

3150
02:48:22,550 --> 02:48:23,470
Okay, yeah, good idea.

3151
02:48:24,290 --> 02:48:25,150
Nice, nice.

3152
02:48:25,950 --> 02:48:26,930
Oh, nice, nice.

3153
02:48:27,570 --> 02:48:28,450
Oh, they're still strong!

3154
02:48:29,070 --> 02:48:30,010
They're hanging in there!

3155
02:48:35,070 --> 02:48:35,950
I'll slice them!

3156
02:48:36,290 --> 02:48:36,570
Yeah!

3157
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:41,490
That's what you need, like, a choke point for.

3158
02:48:41,810 --> 02:48:42,750
I know, right?

3159
02:48:43,070 --> 02:48:43,630
Corridor.

3160
02:48:44,810 --> 02:48:45,270
Nice.

3161
02:48:53,520 --> 02:48:54,080
Okay.

3162
02:48:55,460 --> 02:48:55,760
Nice.

3163
02:48:55,820 --> 02:48:56,800
You combine the herbs.

3164
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:57,480
Nice.

3165
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:03,160
Hey.

3166
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:03,940
Hey.

3167
02:49:04,460 --> 02:49:04,800
Hey.

3168
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:15,410
Maybe this was the end of the prologue.

3169
02:49:15,650 --> 02:49:18,370
Yeah, no, there was like a helicopter that crashed, right?

3170
02:49:18,730 --> 02:49:19,250
Yeah, or something.

3171
02:49:19,510 --> 02:49:19,630
Yeah.

3172
02:49:19,710 --> 02:49:21,690
It must have been Ada in the helicopter.

3173
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:23,170
I don't know.

3174
02:49:23,330 --> 02:49:24,730
Didn't we get on the helicopter?

3175
02:49:25,890 --> 02:49:26,910
Yeah, we did.

3176
02:49:27,170 --> 02:49:27,990
We got picked up.

3177
02:49:28,190 --> 02:49:28,530
Willers.

3178
02:49:29,170 --> 02:49:29,430
Yeah.

3179
02:49:32,010 --> 02:49:32,990
Oh my gosh, we had nothing.

3180
02:49:32,990 --> 02:49:33,890
Oh, I remember this.

3181
02:49:33,930 --> 02:49:34,670
Yeah, me too.

3182
02:49:36,670 --> 02:49:38,710
I just ran right through.

3183
02:49:38,910 --> 02:49:39,450
Oh shit.

3184
02:49:40,130 --> 02:49:41,750
Yeah, I think we could probably just run.

3185
02:49:43,750 --> 02:49:45,530
They're not worried about us.

3186
02:49:45,650 --> 02:49:46,750
Wait, where do we go?

3187
02:49:48,530 --> 02:49:51,440
Where'd you go?

3188
02:49:51,480 --> 02:49:52,180
Where'd you go?

3189
02:49:52,560 --> 02:49:53,180
Oh, you're there.

3190
02:49:53,500 --> 02:49:53,720
Okay.

3191
02:49:55,740 --> 02:49:56,600
Um, well.

3192
02:50:01,250 --> 02:50:03,330
Can we go on the car?

3193
02:50:03,910 --> 02:50:05,570
Maybe we gotta shoot that guy.

3194
02:50:06,190 --> 02:50:06,390
Oh.

3195
02:50:07,290 --> 02:50:08,130
Oh, here we go.

3196
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:08,550
Okay.

3197
02:50:09,310 --> 02:50:09,650
Oh.

3198
02:50:13,240 --> 02:50:41,240
stab stab stab stab oh are you okay I'm okay this happened oh my gosh that was close oh yeah this did happen yeah uh-oh watch out and then we had to run through while everything was yes it's like Sonic Adventure 2 the very beginning

3199
02:50:49,890 --> 02:50:51,130
Wait, that's not Ada.

3200
02:50:52,070 --> 02:50:54,490
No, because Ada didn't pick us up either.

3201
02:50:55,110 --> 02:50:55,710
Oh, yeah.

3202
02:50:55,810 --> 02:50:57,410
I guess I would have remembered her.

3203
02:50:58,130 --> 02:50:59,710
Her beautiful red shirt.

3204
02:51:11,520 --> 02:51:12,860
Yeah, this happened too.

3205
02:51:13,840 --> 02:51:15,540
And then I knew the QTEs.

3206
02:51:17,220 --> 02:51:20,840
See, it doesn't matter that we didn't show the prologue on stream.

3207
02:51:21,020 --> 02:51:21,820
They'll see it anyway.

3208
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:23,860
Yeah, you guys are getting the full experience.

3209
02:51:27,280 --> 02:51:28,460
This is what you meant.

3210
02:51:35,080 --> 02:51:36,380
Oh, you have...

3211
02:51:36,380 --> 02:51:37,480
How did this happen?

3212
02:51:40,470 --> 02:51:42,150
You were perfectly fine.

3213
02:51:44,730 --> 02:51:45,770
Uh oh.

3214
02:51:46,990 --> 02:51:47,030
Oh.

3215
02:51:49,030 --> 02:51:50,890
Leon's always having to control a plane.

3216
02:51:51,930 --> 02:51:53,350
Pull up, pull up, pull up!

3217
02:51:54,090 --> 02:51:54,410
Oh!

3218
02:51:58,890 --> 02:52:01,350
He did not do so well last time.

3219
02:52:01,450 --> 02:52:02,550
He flew the plane though.

3220
02:52:02,650 --> 02:52:03,330
No, he didn't.

3221
02:52:04,110 --> 02:52:06,230
He could actually invest in lessons.

3222
02:52:07,570 --> 02:52:09,570
It's probably worth it.

3223
02:52:11,970 --> 02:52:12,710
Is he...

3224
02:52:12,710 --> 02:52:13,490
He's turned!

3225
02:52:13,670 --> 02:52:14,090
Is he alive?

3226
02:52:14,370 --> 02:52:14,550
No.

3227
02:52:14,610 --> 02:52:15,290
Is he turning?

3228
02:52:15,710 --> 02:52:16,570
Yeah, yeah!

3229
02:52:18,030 --> 02:52:18,930
Drop him!

3230
02:52:19,030 --> 02:52:19,450
Helena.

3231
02:52:20,270 --> 02:52:20,430
Helena.

3232
02:52:21,090 --> 02:52:21,150
Oh, shoot.

3233
02:52:22,190 --> 02:52:22,310
Oh!

3234
02:52:24,110 --> 02:52:25,890
Sorry, sorry, hold on!

3235
02:52:31,220 --> 02:52:32,860
The slowest QTE in history.

3236
02:52:35,640 --> 02:52:39,740
Whoa, I'm not very good at piloting this thing!

3237
02:52:39,860 --> 02:52:40,080
Oh!

3238
02:52:43,240 --> 02:52:45,000
It's like that SpongeBob scene.

3239
02:52:45,220 --> 02:52:45,800
You're good.

3240
02:52:46,280 --> 02:52:46,880
You're good.

3241
02:52:51,480 --> 02:52:53,700
How are we still, like, in a...

3242
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:54,340
I know.

3243
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:58,160
In a functioning...

3244
02:52:58,160 --> 02:52:58,500
Yeah.

3245
02:53:00,220 --> 02:53:01,260
And even now!

3246
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:02,900
Oh, yeah, I remember, I remember.

3247
02:53:03,080 --> 02:53:04,640
And then it's going to fall on us.

3248
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:08,580
Uh-oh.

3249
02:53:08,680 --> 02:53:09,420
I think it ended.

3250
02:53:09,480 --> 02:53:11,100
We were in, like, a big room or something.

3251
02:53:11,160 --> 02:53:11,560
Yeah.

3252
02:53:13,460 --> 02:53:13,860
Oh.

3253
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:18,280
I don't remember that.

3254
02:53:18,600 --> 02:53:18,640
You do?

3255
02:53:18,880 --> 02:53:20,500
It's just like the Walking Dead.

3256
02:53:20,680 --> 02:53:21,300
It really is.

3257
02:53:21,340 --> 02:53:21,840
Uh-oh.

3258
02:53:23,280 --> 02:53:23,860
Uh-oh.

3259
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:24,840
Uh, space.

3260
02:53:25,760 --> 02:53:27,440
I almost did not get that.

3261
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:32,700
Can a girl drink water?

3262
02:53:33,700 --> 02:53:34,180
No.

3263
02:53:38,670 --> 02:53:39,230
Holy.

3264
02:53:39,370 --> 02:53:40,110
No hydration.

3265
02:53:41,090 --> 02:53:42,750
Yeah, not an invasion of evil.

3266
02:53:44,670 --> 02:53:44,970
Wait.

3267
02:53:46,770 --> 02:53:47,870
Oh, is there loot?

3268
02:53:48,050 --> 02:53:48,330
Yeah.

3269
02:53:48,510 --> 02:53:48,590
Yeah.

3270
02:53:50,610 --> 02:53:51,190
There's new.

3271
02:53:51,530 --> 02:53:52,110
I almost missed it.

3272
02:53:52,810 --> 02:53:53,890
My eyes are peeled.

3273
02:53:54,450 --> 02:53:54,930
Herb.

3274
02:53:56,830 --> 02:53:59,450
I feel like I should get rid of something so I could combine herb.

3275
02:53:59,510 --> 02:54:00,870
Oh yeah, I can add this, right?

3276
02:54:01,710 --> 02:54:03,490
Or does, no, herb green.

3277
02:54:04,530 --> 02:54:06,730
Oh, there is an herb green.

3278
02:54:07,150 --> 02:54:07,350
Nah.

3279
02:54:08,050 --> 02:54:10,150
I feel like I should get rid of something.

3280
02:54:11,470 --> 02:54:13,690
Get rid of one herb red.

3281
02:54:15,250 --> 02:54:15,990
Single herb.

3282
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:17,070
And then combine.

3283
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:18,090
Yeah.

3284
02:54:19,450 --> 02:54:19,930
Okay.

3285
02:54:20,910 --> 02:54:23,070
I actually have healing for once.

3286
02:54:23,550 --> 02:54:23,770
Nice.

3287
02:54:24,530 --> 02:54:27,090
Okay, so let's get rid of...

3288
02:54:29,430 --> 02:54:31,050
I'll get rid of my bombs.

3289
02:54:31,230 --> 02:54:34,990
Wait, I have more bombs than I have grenades, so maybe bombs would be better.

3290
02:54:37,650 --> 02:54:37,850
Hmm.

3291
02:54:39,950 --> 02:54:42,690
Oh, there's a serpent thing.

3292
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:43,730
Oh, there is.

3293
02:54:44,450 --> 02:54:45,130
Over here.

3294
02:54:46,730 --> 02:54:47,210

3297
02:55:20,420 --> 02:55:21,360
The little snake guy.

3298
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:22,160
Oh, I see him.

3299
02:55:22,200 --> 02:55:23,000
Oh, what are you doing?

3300
02:55:23,820 --> 02:55:25,860
Ah, serpent emblem.

3301
02:55:27,880 --> 02:55:28,780
Okay, wait.

3302
02:55:29,760 --> 02:55:30,580
Oh, wait.

3303
02:55:31,460 --> 02:55:31,620
Huh?

3304
02:55:32,680 --> 02:55:35,400
The red, the red herb disappeared on me.

3305
02:55:35,800 --> 02:55:36,100
Did it?

3306
02:55:36,760 --> 02:55:37,200
Yeah.

3307
02:55:38,040 --> 02:55:38,500
Oh.

3308
02:55:38,900 --> 02:55:39,220
What?

3309
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:41,120
Wait, where did it go?

3310
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:42,780
Did it despawn?

3311
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:45,280
Oh, they do despawn!

3312
02:55:45,860 --> 02:55:46,440
Oh, they do despawn!

3313
02:55:47,220 --> 02:55:47,540
No.

3314
02:55:47,540 --> 02:55:48,320
No way.

3315
02:55:49,680 --> 02:55:50,120
No!

3316
02:55:50,660 --> 02:55:51,140
It's okay.

3317
02:55:53,100 --> 02:55:55,380
I'm sure you don't need the healing anyway.

3318
02:55:55,500 --> 02:55:55,860
Yeah!

3319
02:55:58,300 --> 02:55:59,700
Something doesn't feel right.

3320
02:55:59,800 --> 02:56:01,560
Is this the final boss zone?

3321
02:56:02,620 --> 02:56:04,160
This looks like the final boss zone.

3322
02:56:04,300 --> 02:56:04,440
You think?

3323
02:56:04,440 --> 02:56:08,020
Look, that spike at the top, it looks like he's gonna get pierced on there.

3324
02:56:08,280 --> 02:56:08,900
Oh yeah.

3325
02:56:10,940 --> 02:56:11,380
Definitely.

3326
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:15,760
No, too soon?

3327
02:56:16,240 --> 02:56:16,920
Aw, man.

3328
02:56:17,400 --> 02:56:18,520

3331
02:56:56,430 --> 02:56:57,310
It's okay, I knew.

3332
02:56:59,070 --> 02:57:01,550
At least you got the name close.

3333
02:57:02,910 --> 02:57:04,310
Wesker's son away!

3334
02:57:05,230 --> 02:57:06,190
Who's Wesker?

3335
02:57:06,650 --> 02:57:07,610
Yeah, who's Wesker?

3336
02:57:07,690 --> 02:57:10,890
I've heard that name before in terms of Chaos and Eagle, but I don't know.

3337
02:57:11,950 --> 02:57:12,910
Who's Wesker's?

3338
02:57:13,070 --> 02:57:15,070
Gee, that's a cute puppy.

3339
02:57:15,510 --> 02:57:17,150
Wesker is a good catnip.

3340
02:57:17,710 --> 02:57:18,130
Yeah!

3341
02:57:21,130 --> 02:57:21,610
I

3342
02:57:25,180 --> 02:57:27,180
hope you got friends on the other side.

3343
02:57:27,300 --> 02:57:27,560
Uh-uh.

3344
02:57:27,980 --> 02:57:29,600
No one's gonna miss you here.

3345
02:57:31,980 --> 02:57:33,000
What a corn ball.

3346
02:57:34,180 --> 02:57:34,700
I know.

3347
02:57:37,560 --> 02:57:38,600
And I...

3348
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:38,840
Whoa.

3349
02:57:40,260 --> 02:57:42,160
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3350
02:57:42,500 --> 02:57:43,440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

3351
02:57:44,040 --> 02:57:45,500
Oh, he's ginormous!

3352
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:47,640
I ran over.

3353
02:57:48,860 --> 02:57:49,380
Um...

3354
02:57:49,900 --> 02:57:51,320
He's like a T-Rex!

3355
02:57:51,640 --> 02:57:51,900
Whoa!

3356
02:57:51,960 --> 02:57:53,780
Yes, you fuck this.

3357
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:54,300
Oh, shoot.

3358
02:57:54,460 --> 02:57:55,380
Wait, where's the good spot?

3359
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:56,280
Oh, he's got you.

3360
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:57,960
I let him eat me.

3361
02:57:57,980 --> 02:58:00,380
because I tried to hit him with my knife.

3362
02:58:01,900 --> 02:58:06,550
Maybe in the eyeballs, there.

3363
02:58:11,970 --> 02:58:13,670
I'm going to let his little tail get me.

3364
02:58:15,650 --> 02:58:17,670
There's exploding barrels, I think.

3365
02:58:19,450 --> 02:58:20,110
Oh, yeah, there are.

3366
02:58:20,190 --> 02:58:20,350
Ah!

3367
02:58:21,230 --> 02:58:22,890
It's my turn to get eaten.

3368
02:58:23,490 --> 02:58:23,990
Oh, oh, whoa.

3369
02:58:24,250 --> 02:58:25,390
Oh, he's a person again.

3370
02:58:27,550 --> 02:58:29,810
Now I can stab him, maybe.

3371
02:58:31,470 --> 02:58:31,670
Dip.

3372
02:58:32,910 --> 02:58:34,130
Oh, nice, nice, nice.

3373
02:58:35,470 --> 02:58:35,690

Get in!

3378
02:59:17,460 --> 02:59:18,000
Okay.

3379
02:59:19,820 --> 02:59:20,700
Oh, yeah!

3380
02:59:20,900 --> 02:59:21,700
Oh, it's our friend!

3381
02:59:21,720 --> 02:59:23,440
Snack is hard, suddenly.

3382
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:24,020
I know.

3383
02:59:25,700 --> 02:59:26,900
Oh, sick!

3384
02:59:32,380 --> 02:59:34,960
We're just doing zoomies in like the...

3385
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:36,680
It's a little weird.

3386
02:59:36,700 --> 02:59:37,600
Just circles.

3387
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:39,740
Donuts!

3388
02:59:39,980 --> 02:59:42,560
This is exactly how I fight an Elden Ring.

3389
02:59:42,880 --> 02:59:43,120
Yeah!

3390
02:59:44,160 --> 02:59:44,480
Yeah!

3391
02:59:47,380 --> 02:59:48,480
Here it comes!

3392
02:59:48,620 --> 02:59:49,100
Get ready!

3393
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:50,740
Here it comes!

3394
02:59:51,040 --> 02:59:54,860
Oh, I think he just chomped me.

3395
02:59:55,900 --> 02:59:56,720
Did he give you?

3396
02:59:58,180 --> 02:59:59,020
I don't like it.

3397
02:59:59,180 --> 03:00:00,100
You're good, you're good?

3398
03:00:02,660 --> 03:00:04,120
I would if I could.

3399
03:00:06,600 --> 03:00:08,060
Get right in the...

3400
03:00:08,060 --> 03:00:13,040
in the singular pizza.

3401
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:15,780
Tracking part.

3402
03:00:16,900 --> 03:00:18,400
Oh my god, no!

3403
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:20,200
Our friend!

3404
03:00:20,780 --> 03:00:20,780
Chris?

3405
03:00:21,180 --> 03:00:21,760
Was that Chris?

3406
03:00:21,940 --> 03:00:23,620
No, that was just random.

3407
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:24,380
Yeah.

3408
03:00:24,640 --> 03:00:26,200
Was that our Uber driver from before?

3409
03:00:26,860 --> 03:00:29,060
It was.

3410
03:00:30,980 --> 03:00:35,400
Wait, I'm gonna run away, and I'm gonna explode him.

3411
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:36,620
Okay.

3412
03:00:37,800 --> 03:00:40,280
Oh, oh, my plan was foiled.

3413
03:00:40,820 --> 03:00:42,080
Okay, I'm gonna run.

3414
03:00:42,740 --> 03:00:43,420
Oh my gosh.

3415
03:00:43,640 --> 03:00:45,800
Why am I almost reloading?

3416
03:00:46,320 --> 03:00:46,520
Oh.

3417
03:00:47,140 --> 03:00:48,180
He's eating cars.

3418
03:00:48,960 --> 03:00:49,860
They'll get closer to me.

3419
03:00:49,960 --> 03:00:50,920
Come here, come here.

3420
03:00:51,100 --> 03:00:52,860
Oh, he really is eating cars.

3421
03:01:05,940 --> 03:01:08,740
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

3422
03:01:08,740 --> 03:01:08,920
Hello.

3423
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:13,320
Punch him, punch him!

3424
03:01:14,140 --> 03:01:15,100
Oh, yeah, yeah!

3425
03:01:19,150 --> 03:01:21,210
He can't do more damage than a bomb.

3426
03:01:21,650 --> 03:01:22,450
Be real.

3427
03:01:23,910 --> 03:01:24,130
Ooh.

3428
03:01:24,530 --> 03:01:26,330
Be for real, Leon.

3429
03:01:27,310 --> 03:01:27,650
Maybe.

3430
03:01:28,830 --> 03:01:29,130
A

3431
03:01:32,610 --> 03:01:33,530
little closer.

3432
03:01:36,470 --> 03:01:37,630
Come in a little closer.

3433
03:01:38,550 --> 03:01:39,190
Oh, I have no box.

3434
03:01:39,490 --> 03:01:40,110
Oh my gosh.

3435
03:01:40,310 --> 03:01:41,650
Good thing he didn't come a little closer.

3436
03:01:47,400 --> 03:01:49,640
Turn your pretty face over here.

3437
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:52,740
Where is another?

3438
03:01:52,880 --> 03:01:53,900
Oh, here we go.

3439
03:01:55,220 --> 03:01:56,980
Maybe if we're both in the same spot.

3440
03:01:57,960 --> 03:01:58,220
Wait?

3441
03:01:58,660 --> 03:01:59,500
Oh, he's down.

3442
03:01:59,640 --> 03:02:00,220
He's down.

3443
03:02:00,520 --> 03:02:00,900
Down?

3444
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:02,400
You can bomb him?

3445
03:02:03,080 --> 03:02:03,860
Do I have any more?

3446
03:02:04,020 --> 03:02:04,400
I don't know.

3447
03:02:07,060 --> 03:02:07,720
Yeah, I do.

3448
03:02:08,260 --> 03:02:08,880
Ah, nice!

3449
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Oh, I'm gonna punch him!

3450
03:02:11,020 --> 03:02:12,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3451
03:02:13,440 --> 03:02:16,460
Get it!

3452
03:02:17,040 --> 03:02:18,020
Get your knife out?

3453
03:02:18,800 --> 03:02:18,800
I

3454
03:02:25,450 --> 03:02:28,250
do have...

3455
03:02:28,250 --> 03:02:29,470
Oh, gosh.

3456
03:02:33,900 --> 03:02:35,420
I wish I could find more, um...

3457
03:02:37,480 --> 03:02:38,320
more bullets.

3458
03:02:39,400 --> 03:02:41,660
There are some barrels around in the middle.

3459
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:42,360
Yeah.

3460
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:46,700
Okay, please, I wanna, I wanna explode something.

3461
03:02:47,800 --> 03:02:48,620
Maybe this one.

3462
03:02:49,460 --> 03:02:50,500
Oh, here, here, here.

3463
03:02:51,500 --> 03:02:52,020
Please!

3464
03:02:52,220 --> 03:02:52,380
Oh!

3465
03:02:54,140 --> 03:02:55,060
What did you get him?

3466
03:02:57,020 --> 03:02:58,340
Seems like it.

3467
03:02:58,880 --> 03:02:59,800
Oh, he's sick.

3468
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:04,540
Just finish him, please.

3469
03:03:04,820 --> 03:03:05,440
I know, right?

3470
03:03:05,540 --> 03:03:06,500
No more mercy.

3471
03:03:11,290 --> 03:03:12,170
Ada's so cool.

3472
03:03:12,590 --> 03:03:13,670
Ada, I know.

3473
03:03:14,470 --> 03:03:16,530
Is she gonna leave mysteriously?

3474
03:03:17,170 --> 03:03:19,670
She's like, wait, our Uber driver.

3475
03:03:19,930 --> 03:03:20,790
She's getting to the roof.

3476
03:03:22,050 --> 03:03:22,670
How do you know that?

3477
03:03:22,850 --> 03:03:51,890
roof knob let's hope the elevator still works oh he can read her mind he thought he lost her there's nothing yeah now he's all like she's still here with me she's still here okay good oh oh i guess the elevator does still work yeah it looks like they're in pretty good Yeah,

3478
03:03:52,730 --> 03:03:55,130
especially for it being like on the outside of the building.

3479
03:03:55,950 --> 03:03:58,610
It's a miracle the glass isn't broken.

3480
03:03:59,490 --> 03:04:02,390
She's more than just a friend, isn't she?

3481
03:04:03,690 --> 03:04:06,930
You have feelings for her.

3482
03:04:18,140 --> 03:04:19,540
They're in rubble.

3483
03:04:20,800 --> 03:04:21,600
Uh-oh.

3484
03:04:24,060 --> 03:04:24,740
Saving.

3485
03:04:25,080 --> 03:04:27,000
Not even checkpoint, just saving.

3486
03:04:31,420 --> 03:04:40,960
oh god this is like my nightmare be like a monkey oh my god wasn't planning to oh my god

3487
03:04:46,720 --> 03:04:50,020

3488
03:04:55,160 --> 03:05:05,060
why did she do that cross that doesn't happen again oh my gosh Oh, he's still going!

3489
03:05:05,260 --> 03:05:06,200
He's still alive!

3490
03:05:07,220 --> 03:05:08,340
Is that...

3491
03:05:08,340 --> 03:05:08,780
It is.

3492
03:05:09,200 --> 03:05:09,360
Yeah.

3493
03:05:12,120 --> 03:05:13,440
I'm just trying.

3494
03:05:13,540 --> 03:05:14,700
I'm climbing so slowly.

3495
03:05:14,900 --> 03:05:15,260
I know.

3496
03:05:16,920 --> 03:05:19,540
I know for a hand if I can scare one.

3497
03:05:23,560 --> 03:05:24,200
Uh-oh.

3498
03:05:24,980 --> 03:05:26,280
She's like Spider-Man.

3499
03:05:26,440 --> 03:05:27,020
She's so cool.

3500
03:05:28,520 --> 03:05:30,260
Both of them were...

3501
03:05:31,160 --> 03:05:32,120
She went up.

3502
03:05:34,700 --> 03:05:36,100
I believe in her.

3503
03:05:36,300 --> 03:05:38,820
Yeah, I don't know why I can hit her helicopter, though.

3504
03:05:38,980 --> 03:05:39,660
Did she crash it?

3505
03:05:39,680 --> 03:05:40,560
Who's that up there?

3506
03:05:42,180 --> 03:05:43,380
Should we kill him?

3507
03:05:43,820 --> 03:05:45,140
Oh, they're like...

3508
03:05:45,140 --> 03:05:45,180
Oh, they're just zombies.

3509
03:05:45,640 --> 03:05:46,320
Yeah, they're zombies.

3510
03:05:47,920 --> 03:05:51,120
I don't have any ammo for my arrive for my sniper.

3511
03:05:52,220 --> 03:05:52,940
How can you even...

3512
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:53,940
I'm almost out.

3513
03:05:56,040 --> 03:05:57,840
I think she's got him, though.

3514
03:05:58,140 --> 03:06:00,020
Oh, my God, there's zombies behind us.

3515
03:06:01,640 --> 03:06:03,960
I thought that was it, for a second.

3516
03:06:05,580 --> 03:06:08,000
How are we even supposed to help?

3517
03:06:10,080 --> 03:06:10,500
I know.

3518
03:06:12,280 --> 03:06:13,280
We're so far away.

3519
03:06:13,820 --> 03:06:15,620
Do non-sniper's help?

3520
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:17,340
I don't even know.

3521
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:18,820
Do our bullets reach?

3522
03:06:19,580 --> 03:06:19,820
Oh.

3523
03:06:23,290 --> 03:06:24,090
Oh, wait.

3524
03:06:24,270 --> 03:06:24,810
They drop ammo.

3525
03:06:24,830 --> 03:06:25,450
They just left her handle.

3526
03:06:26,790 --> 03:06:27,190
Oh.

3527
03:06:28,150 --> 03:06:31,390
Do they drop sniper him?

3528
03:06:32,030 --> 03:06:32,490
Oh, I got five.

3529
03:06:32,490 --> 03:06:33,610
Oh, they do.

3530
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:35,830
Oh, ow.

3531
03:06:36,750 --> 03:06:37,850
Hey, nerd.

3532
03:06:41,610 --> 03:06:42,270
Oh, nice.

3533
03:06:43,390 --> 03:06:43,830
Okay.

3534
03:06:46,700 --> 03:06:48,980
I think she's owning him though, honestly.

3535
03:06:49,360 --> 03:06:51,920
He keeps like...

3536
03:06:54,820 --> 03:06:56,280
Enough to where he's like...

3537
03:06:56,280 --> 03:06:57,040
Oh my gosh, my M.

3538
03:06:57,180 --> 03:06:58,480
Oh, my shaky hand.

3539
03:06:58,920 --> 03:06:59,320
No.

3540
03:07:00,320 --> 03:07:00,960
Oh?

3541
03:07:02,180 --> 03:07:02,820
Jump!

3542
03:07:06,320 --> 03:07:07,480
Come on, Leon.

3543
03:07:07,700 --> 03:07:08,820
Oh, not just again.

3544
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:11,080
Don't drop.

3545
03:07:14,980 --> 03:07:15,660
Oh!

3546
03:07:15,980 --> 03:07:16,740
Oh, you're...

3547
03:07:16,740 --> 03:07:17,900
It's

3548
03:07:23,110 --> 03:07:25,590
such as like a spider monkey moment.

3549
03:07:27,010 --> 03:07:28,510
She just has to...

3550
03:07:28,510 --> 03:07:29,170
Uh-oh.

3551
03:07:30,330 --> 03:07:31,370
Uh-oh.

3552
03:07:31,730 --> 03:07:32,310
Uh-oh.

3553
03:07:33,410 --> 03:07:34,090
Oh!

3554
03:07:34,090 --> 03:07:34,850
Oh my god!

3555
03:07:35,170 --> 03:07:36,390
I'm sorry.

3556
03:07:37,210 --> 03:07:37,890
Oh!

3557
03:07:41,820 --> 03:07:43,060
She's too fast!

3558
03:07:43,280 --> 03:07:44,140
Let me help you up!

3559
03:07:44,220 --> 03:07:45,120
Let me help you up!

3560
03:07:46,740 --> 03:07:47,540
Come on!

3561
03:07:47,780 --> 03:07:48,340
Where are you?

3562
03:07:49,060 --> 03:07:50,700
I'm way down there!

3563
03:07:50,720 --> 03:07:52,900
Oh gosh, you could go.

3564
03:07:53,600 --> 03:07:55,920
Click, click, click your life defense on it.

3565
03:07:59,860 --> 03:08:01,680
Why do I have to be on the bottom?

3566
03:08:02,620 --> 03:08:04,840
I can't tell if there's guys behind me or not.

3567
03:08:04,940 --> 03:08:05,680
I hear things.

3568
03:08:06,320 --> 03:08:07,360
Here she goes.

3569
03:08:08,420 --> 03:08:11,590
It's the top already.

3570
03:08:12,150 --> 03:08:14,590
His legs are not even wrapped around.

3571
03:08:15,270 --> 03:08:15,490
It's

3572
03:08:32,320 --> 03:08:33,700
all arm strength.

3573
03:08:33,860 --> 03:08:34,460
It's crazy.

3574
03:08:36,820 --> 03:08:37,900
Elena, cover me.

3575
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:38,720
What?

3576
03:08:38,720 --> 03:08:40,760
You just got up here!

3577
03:08:41,960 --> 03:08:42,620
Leon!

3578
03:08:43,780 --> 03:08:45,380
He just does what he wants.

3579
03:08:45,580 --> 03:08:46,280
He really does.

3580
03:08:47,900 --> 03:08:48,820
Oh no.

3581
03:08:49,560 --> 03:08:50,920
Oh, I don't have any more bullets!

3582
03:08:52,260 --> 03:08:52,920
Um...

3583
03:08:52,920 --> 03:08:53,900
I'm looking around.

3584
03:08:56,120 --> 03:08:57,860
Wait, the music is like so dramatic.

3585
03:08:58,340 --> 03:08:58,880
It's sad.

3586
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:00,060
It is.

3587
03:09:01,020 --> 03:09:01,560
Oh!

3588
03:09:02,160 --> 03:09:03,720
He loves Ada?

3589
03:09:04,580 --> 03:09:06,080
Not if I can help it.

3590
03:09:06,340 --> 03:09:06,740
No!

3591
03:09:11,230 --> 03:09:11,890
Oh!

3592
03:09:12,430 --> 03:09:13,730
Can I spray her?

3593
03:09:14,410 --> 03:09:15,950
There it is.

3594
03:09:16,350 --> 03:09:16,390
Oh.

3595
03:09:19,300 --> 03:09:20,120
Oh no.

3596
03:09:21,040 --> 03:09:21,660
Uh-oh.

3597
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:22,400
Whoa!

3598
03:09:26,240 --> 03:09:26,300
Whoa!

3599
03:09:27,120 --> 03:09:30,900
I think I just took bullets for her.

3600
03:09:31,720 --> 03:09:33,500
I was just resting there, guys.

3601
03:09:34,080 --> 03:09:35,100
You're having a love story.

3602
03:09:36,040 --> 03:09:36,820
I'm third?

3603
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:38,200
I'm third wheeling.

3604
03:09:38,820 --> 03:09:40,180
Oh, I guess I didn't die.

3605
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:42,620
I thought he was about to die for her.

3606
03:09:44,100 --> 03:09:45,720
Oh, it caps lock to zoom in.

3607
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:48,300
Uh-oh.

3608
03:09:48,360 --> 03:09:48,780
Uh-oh.

3609
03:09:48,780 --> 03:09:49,760
I'm out of bullets again.

3610
03:09:50,100 --> 03:09:50,300
Ah!

3611
03:09:51,380 --> 03:09:52,000
Uh-oh.

3612
03:09:52,320 --> 03:09:52,960
I'm okay.

3613
03:09:53,380 --> 03:09:54,440
Sorry, I just got spooked.

3614
03:09:55,820 --> 03:09:56,120
Oh!

3615
03:09:56,320 --> 03:09:57,340
This guy will drop something, right?

3616
03:09:57,380 --> 03:09:58,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3617
03:09:58,940 --> 03:10:00,100
Oh, there's stuff here.

3618
03:10:00,240 --> 03:10:00,440
Where?

3619
03:10:00,460 --> 03:10:01,240
Are you up there?

3620
03:10:01,480 --> 03:10:02,680
Yeah, I'm still up here.

3621
03:10:02,860 --> 03:10:03,700
Thank gosh.

3622
03:10:06,260 --> 03:10:06,660
Oh!

3623
03:10:07,860 --> 03:10:08,720
Where is he?

3624
03:10:08,920 --> 03:10:09,400
Oh, wait.

3625
03:10:09,480 --> 03:10:09,820
Uh-oh.

3626
03:10:09,960 --> 03:10:10,920
Oh, there we go.

3627
03:10:13,360 --> 03:10:14,740
Oh, my gosh.

3628
03:10:14,780 --> 03:10:15,840
Oh, we didn't drop what I needed.

3629
03:10:16,640 --> 03:10:18,540
Oh no, no, no!

3630
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:26,380
Maybe he's right.

3631
03:10:26,620 --> 03:10:29,080
Maybe I'm not the man that she needs.

3632
03:10:35,600 --> 03:10:35,900
Ah!

3633
03:10:36,440 --> 03:10:37,780
Wait, maybe there's more over here.

3634
03:10:38,240 --> 03:10:38,600
Oh!

3635
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:47,980
I don't even know where to aim!

3636
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:49,410
Oh!

3637
03:10:51,210 --> 03:10:52,130
Not again!

3638
03:10:52,530 --> 03:10:53,210
Not again!

3639
03:10:54,630 --> 03:10:55,970
Oh, where's his face?

3640
03:10:56,090 --> 03:10:57,110
Where's your ugly face?

3641
03:10:57,410 --> 03:10:57,510
Oh!

3642
03:11:03,310 --> 03:11:04,750
Assault, rival, don't go!

3643
03:11:05,590 --> 03:11:07,150
Oh, I have the bullets!

3644
03:11:10,190 --> 03:11:13,550
I'm just fighting zombies for no reason.

3645
03:11:14,050 --> 03:11:16,330
Just, I'll let Ada handle the big guy.

3646
03:11:16,710 --> 03:11:17,350
Yeah, yeah.

3647
03:11:21,430 --> 03:11:24,350
Ada, you mind if I combine herbs real quick?

3648
03:11:28,240 --> 03:11:29,340
You're a guy snarling.

3649
03:11:29,480 --> 03:11:29,980
Oh, there he is.

3650
03:11:31,320 --> 03:11:31,560
Hi.

3651
03:11:33,420 --> 03:11:33,900
Oops.

3652
03:11:44,780 --> 03:11:45,940
Guys, don't look, okay?

3653
03:11:47,440 --> 03:11:48,400

3659
03:12:42,680 --> 03:12:43,520
I'm trying!

3660
03:12:47,980 --> 03:12:48,980
Don't beg!

3661
03:12:49,940 --> 03:12:51,560
I'm not gonna beg!

3662
03:12:53,080 --> 03:12:53,640
Oh!

3663
03:12:55,660 --> 03:12:57,400
She chooses me!

3664
03:12:58,340 --> 03:12:58,900
No!

3665
03:12:59,720 --> 03:13:01,300
Oh wait, she's Spider-Man, it's fun.

3666
03:13:02,040 --> 03:13:04,960
Wait, that's all it took for him was just a little...

3667
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:06,720
A little stab?

3668
03:13:06,780 --> 03:13:08,580
I've been trying to stab him the whole time!

3669
03:13:09,680 --> 03:13:13,740
Why couldn't he, like, transform midfall and, like, be it?

3670
03:13:13,800 --> 03:13:14,040
No.

3671
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:17,960
Nice.

3672
03:13:19,480 --> 03:13:20,280
It's over.

3673
03:13:21,440 --> 03:13:21,880
Ada.

3674
03:13:22,480 --> 03:13:23,380
Oh, she's over there.

3675
03:13:23,500 --> 03:13:24,580
You'll never be with her.

3676
03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:25,440
No.

3677
03:13:26,440 --> 03:13:27,460
What are you?

3678
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:28,580
Why are you helping us?

3679
03:13:29,160 --> 03:13:30,500
I thought we're, like, an item.

3680
03:13:30,960 --> 03:13:31,980
Yeah, I thought so, too.

3681
03:13:32,780 --> 03:13:33,080
Oh, wait.

3682
03:13:33,560 --> 03:13:34,520
She just texted him.

3683
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:34,980
Oh.

3684
03:13:35,220 --> 03:13:36,200
But I've got to run.

3685
03:13:36,740 --> 03:13:38,960
I've left you a little parting gift on the roof.

3686
03:13:39,760 --> 03:13:41,600
See you down the road, Leon.

3687
03:13:43,840 --> 03:13:45,380
This is a ducky mackerel.

3688
03:13:47,180 --> 03:13:49,220
What are you waiting for?

3689
03:13:50,620 --> 03:13:51,620
Go after her.

3690
03:13:51,880 --> 03:13:52,980
Yeah, go after her.

3691
03:13:53,680 --> 03:13:56,140
No, we're sticking together.

3692
03:13:59,220 --> 03:13:59,820
Aww.

3693
03:14:04,270 --> 03:14:05,270
Ada ducky mackerel.

3694
03:14:05,390 --> 03:14:06,490
Yeah, we need her kisses.

3695
03:14:07,650 --> 03:14:09,430
It's the only way we'll get them.

3696
03:14:09,530 --> 03:14:09,870
Yeah.

3697
03:14:11,430 --> 03:14:13,410
He was running off.

3698
03:14:14,150 --> 03:14:16,110
Is the gift on a roof a good thing?

3699
03:14:16,210 --> 03:14:17,410
No, I'm not sure.

3700
03:14:18,930 --> 03:14:20,590
Is it all these zombies?

3701
03:14:21,990 --> 03:14:23,010
It's a buffet.

3702
03:14:26,630 --> 03:14:27,010
Yeah.

3703
03:14:27,890 --> 03:14:28,150
It's the curb.

3704
03:14:28,550 --> 03:14:29,390
It's got to be the curb.

3705
03:14:29,790 --> 03:14:30,470
Oh, it's a helicopter.

3706
03:14:31,970 --> 03:14:34,370
Why are there so many people on the roof?

3707
03:14:34,930 --> 03:14:35,490
I know.

3708
03:14:35,850 --> 03:14:35,850
Ooh.

3709
03:14:36,610 --> 03:14:37,410
Uh oh.

3710
03:14:37,850 --> 03:14:38,630
Uh oh.

3711
03:14:38,770 --> 03:14:39,590
What is that?

3712
03:14:41,430 --> 03:14:43,570
Tell me that he has fire powers now.

3713
03:14:43,590 --> 03:14:44,630
They're mutating!

3714
03:14:48,110 --> 03:14:49,450
That's not good.

3715
03:14:49,810 --> 03:14:50,990
Wait, it's good, actually?

3716
03:14:51,170 --> 03:14:52,710
It's... Oh, maybe not.

3717
03:14:55,210 --> 03:14:56,650
He just won't die!

3718
03:14:59,050 --> 03:15:00,850
He became fire.

3719
03:15:02,410 --> 03:15:04,330
He can't be killed.

3720
03:15:07,250 --> 03:15:07,810
Simmons!

3721
03:15:07,810 --> 03:15:10,070
I have no bullets left.

3722
03:15:10,410 --> 03:15:10,670
Oh, why?

3723
03:15:10,750 --> 03:15:11,310
No.

3724
03:15:12,750 --> 03:15:13,750
Oh!

3725
03:15:14,270 --> 03:15:15,230
Oh!

3726
03:15:16,090 --> 03:15:16,310
Oh!

3727
03:15:22,710 --> 03:15:22,950
Oh!

3728
03:15:25,150 --> 03:15:25,350
Oh!

3729
03:15:26,110 --> 03:15:26,310
Oh!

3730
03:15:26,310 --> 03:15:27,950
They're feasting upon him!

3731
03:15:28,550 --> 03:15:29,350
Now go!

3732
03:15:30,310 --> 03:15:31,290
Uh...

3733
03:15:31,290 --> 03:15:31,930
Okay.

3734
03:15:32,150 --> 03:15:32,930
He was weakened.

3735
03:15:33,990 --> 03:15:34,350
What?

3736
03:15:35,210 --> 03:15:37,390
It took two shots.

3737
03:15:37,630 --> 03:15:38,430
Kids.

3738
03:15:40,070 --> 03:15:40,950
Is he gone?

3739
03:15:40,950 --> 03:15:41,270
Is he gone?

3740
03:15:42,890 --> 03:15:50,210
wait where's our where's our copter like uh this way there's loot yeah

3741
03:15:53,880 --> 03:16:16,200
i like how they're still given a skill point i know well can you use them i don't know they carry over to the other campaigns i guess so that would make sense you gotta get to that helicopter the heli and the sooner the better the helicopter this way wait this way oh this I think we go down and somehow around.

3742
03:16:16,940 --> 03:16:18,260
Wait, am I... no, yeah.

3743
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:19,900
Yes.

3744
03:16:20,820 --> 03:16:22,400
Am I going the right way?

3745
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:23,200
This way, this way.

3746
03:16:23,320 --> 03:16:23,920
Okay, okay, okay.

3747
03:16:24,940 --> 03:16:25,640
I'm here!

3748
03:16:30,010 --> 03:16:31,390
Um, this way.

3749
03:16:31,670 --> 03:16:31,930
Okay.

3750
03:16:32,410 --> 03:16:33,190
I'm looting.

3751
03:16:34,150 --> 03:16:36,590
Then I guess we still need to shoot and stuff.

3752
03:16:36,590 --> 03:16:37,250
I know, right?

3753
03:16:37,310 --> 03:16:38,790
Do we still need loot?

3754
03:16:39,130 --> 03:16:40,250
Oh, I think we gotta push this.

3755
03:16:40,390 --> 03:16:40,770
Leon.

3756
03:16:41,870 --> 03:16:42,070
Oh.

3757
03:16:42,330 --> 03:16:42,730
Leon.

3758
03:16:43,830 --> 03:16:44,310
Leon.

3759
03:16:44,470 --> 03:16:44,890
This way.

3760
03:16:45,030 --> 03:16:45,910
We don't push.

3761
03:16:46,590 --> 03:16:47,750
I go up, I think.

3762
03:16:48,350 --> 03:16:49,430
Oh, yes.

3763
03:16:52,050 --> 03:16:53,870
Oh, we both go up.

3764
03:16:54,250 --> 03:16:55,350
But sometimes you...

3765
03:16:55,350 --> 03:16:56,750
Why is he a fly?

3766
03:16:58,450 --> 03:16:59,690
What is happening?

3767
03:17:00,570 --> 03:17:00,930
How?

3768
03:17:01,070 --> 03:17:03,330
What did she get injected with?

3769
03:17:04,090 --> 03:17:04,550
Uh-oh.

3770
03:17:05,110 --> 03:17:06,050
Just get me out of here.

3771
03:17:06,710 --> 03:17:07,270
Get you?

3772
03:17:07,550 --> 03:17:08,330
What about being?

3773
03:17:11,730 --> 03:17:12,290
Um...

3774
03:17:12,290 --> 03:17:13,270
Are you okay?

3775
03:17:13,450 --> 03:17:14,410
You like to play rough, huh?

3776
03:17:15,070 --> 03:17:15,510
Yeah.

3777
03:17:16,490 --> 03:17:18,230
I'm gonna shoot him in his eyes.

3778
03:17:18,470 --> 03:17:20,310
I see what I need to do.

3779
03:17:23,130 --> 03:17:24,250
But I'm all out of bullets.

3780
03:17:24,770 --> 03:17:25,130
Oh shoot.

3781
03:17:26,210 --> 03:17:27,490
I should have killed those guys first.

3782
03:17:27,510 --> 03:17:28,850
Whatever you're doing, it's working.

3783
03:17:29,970 --> 03:17:30,370
Okay!

3805
03:19:18,510 --> 03:19:18,910

3809
03:19:25,270 --> 03:19:25,510

3812
03:19:32,490 --> 03:19:33,450
The desperation.

3813
03:19:34,290 --> 03:19:35,190
Never gets old.

3814
03:19:35,590 --> 03:19:35,690
I know.

3815
03:19:36,050 --> 03:19:36,570
This is bad.

3816
03:19:36,970 --> 03:19:38,170
We gotta get to the helicopter.

3817
03:19:38,730 --> 03:19:39,050
Okay.

3818
03:19:39,450 --> 03:19:39,450
Oh.

3819
03:19:41,190 --> 03:19:42,390
Yeah, but hold on.

3820
03:19:45,430 --> 03:19:47,470

3821
03:19:47,470 --> 03:19:47,950

03:19:48,230 --> 03:19:48,770
Oh, there's that.

3823
03:19:49,110 --> 03:19:49,750
Up here.

3824
03:19:53,170 --> 03:19:54,210
And then...

3825
03:19:54,210 --> 03:19:54,930
More loot?

3826
03:19:55,090 --> 03:19:56,190

3827
03:19:58,270 --> 03:19:58,790
Nice.

3828
03:20:00,150 --> 03:20:01,190
And then...

3829
03:20:01,190 --> 03:20:01,910
Wait, where?

3830
03:20:02,630 --> 03:20:03,130
Uh-oh.

3831
03:20:04,370 --> 03:20:05,030
Uh-oh.

3832
03:20:05,530 --> 03:20:06,210
Uh-oh.

3833
03:20:06,270 --> 03:20:07,830
Oh, he's taking more guys!

3834
03:20:08,050 --> 03:20:09,030
No, no!

3835
03:20:09,030 --> 03:20:12,470
How many final forms does this guy have?

3836
03:20:18,760 --> 03:20:20,400
He's gone full bud.

3837
03:20:21,400 --> 03:20:21,520
He's too bud.

3838
03:20:21,540 --> 03:20:22,100
Yes.

3839
03:20:23,520 --> 03:20:24,080
This

3840
03:20:33,600 --> 03:20:34,700
is crazy.

3841
03:20:39,860 --> 03:20:41,680
You okay over there?

3842
03:20:42,640 --> 03:20:43,680
Yeah, I think so.

3843
03:20:43,840 --> 03:20:44,780
Oh, by the camera.

3844
03:20:45,140 --> 03:20:46,000
By the camera just...

3845
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:47,540
Oh, I'm right by his leg.

3846
03:20:50,460 --> 03:20:50,820
Oh, by...

3847
03:20:50,820 --> 03:20:51,460
Oh, the camera!

3848
03:20:51,760 --> 03:20:52,040
Oh, the camera!

3849
03:20:55,180 --> 03:20:57,420
Don't stand in the corner.

3850
03:20:57,820 --> 03:20:59,540
Why were you in the corner?

3851
03:21:04,270 --> 03:21:05,950
There's just zombies coming too.

3852
03:21:06,250 --> 03:21:06,730
I know.

3853
03:21:08,270 --> 03:21:08,970
I could have sworn.

3854
03:21:09,210 --> 03:21:10,090
It says I have 20.

3855
03:21:10,890 --> 03:21:12,030
Why wouldn't it let me reload?

3856
03:21:12,450 --> 03:21:14,330
Oh, because I already reloaded them, I'm stupid.

3857
03:21:18,810 --> 03:21:19,610
I'm helping.

3858
03:21:20,170 --> 03:21:21,190
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3859
03:21:22,150 --> 03:21:23,130
Oh, I'm in trouble.

3860
03:21:23,330 --> 03:21:23,690
I'm low.

3861
03:21:24,110 --> 03:21:24,510
I'm low.

3862
03:21:28,600 --> 03:21:30,200
I got part of them.

3863
03:21:30,260 --> 03:21:31,540
Yeah, yeah.

3864
03:21:31,840 --> 03:21:32,520
Oh, there's an herb.

3865
03:21:34,180 --> 03:21:36,580
Why can't there be more bullets?

3866
03:21:39,160 --> 03:21:41,020
I wasted them all.

3867
03:21:44,220 --> 03:21:46,620
Please, stop dropping skill points.

3868
03:21:47,180 --> 03:21:48,020
Drop bullet.

3869
03:21:48,800 --> 03:21:49,980
What does this thing do?

3870
03:21:50,580 --> 03:21:51,160
I don't know.

3871
03:21:51,340 --> 03:21:52,920
Yeah, can we do something with that?

3872
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:54,620
Oh, no, it grew back.

3873
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:55,520
Are you kidding me?

3874
03:21:58,540 --> 03:21:59,460
There's herbs!

3875
03:21:59,780 --> 03:21:59,980
Ouch!

3876
03:22:00,380 --> 03:22:01,240
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3877
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:06,040
Oh shoot!

3878
03:22:15,980 --> 03:22:17,440
This is tough.

3879
03:22:18,360 --> 03:22:18,680
I know.

3880
03:22:20,420 --> 03:22:21,860
Where do we shoot him?

3881
03:22:22,480 --> 03:22:23,880
I've been shooting like...

3882
03:22:23,880 --> 03:22:24,680
Thrive holes?

3883
03:22:24,980 --> 03:22:26,160
Yeah, the little thing.

3884
03:22:26,220 --> 03:22:26,980
The glowy bits?

3885
03:22:27,080 --> 03:22:28,360
Yeah, but now it's nothing's glowing!

3886
03:22:29,780 --> 03:22:30,120
What the?

3887
03:22:30,700 --> 03:22:31,300
Okay.

3888
03:22:31,980 --> 03:22:33,240
That was his snack.

3889
03:22:33,340 --> 03:22:34,480
He was saving for later.

3890
03:22:36,500 --> 03:22:37,980
Why did he do that?

3891
03:22:38,200 --> 03:22:39,140
Wait, did he get...

3892
03:22:39,140 --> 03:22:42,730
I think he got his dude.

3893
03:22:43,230 --> 03:22:43,510
Let's go.

3894
03:22:46,030 --> 03:22:47,810
Oh, I'm so almost dead.

3895
03:22:52,130 --> 03:22:53,910
Can you find any herbs?

3896
03:22:54,390 --> 03:22:54,750
No.

3897
03:22:55,390 --> 03:22:55,670
Oh, wait.

3898
03:22:56,130 --> 03:22:57,210
Oh, here we go.

3899
03:23:04,980 --> 03:23:05,420

3904
03:23:24,870 --> 03:23:27,490

Ballets.

3909
03:24:04,570 --> 03:24:05,850
Why is it all skill?

3910
03:24:09,490 --> 03:24:10,090

The final boss.

I don't know.

3916
03:24:20,630 --> 03:24:21,710
I don't believe anyone.

3917
03:24:21,910 --> 03:24:23,430
There can be a final boss.

3918
03:24:23,570 --> 03:24:25,310
There will always be another stage.

3919
03:24:25,930 --> 03:24:26,810
I know, right?

3920
03:24:27,170 --> 03:24:28,170
It'll never end.

3921
03:24:29,510 --> 03:24:31,470
All right, we need to ground this asshole.

3922
03:24:31,750 --> 03:24:31,930
Oh.

3923
03:24:32,210 --> 03:24:32,870
Let's see.

3924
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:35,490
As long as he's airborne, we're not going anywhere on that chopper.

3925
03:24:36,210 --> 03:24:36,690
Okay.

3926
03:24:37,510 --> 03:24:38,010
Go for his legs.

3927
03:24:38,010 --> 03:24:39,390
Oh, there's boxes over here.

3928
03:24:39,910 --> 03:24:41,730
Oh, it's all skill points.

3929
03:24:41,990 --> 03:24:42,650
Go for his legs?

3930
03:24:44,590 --> 03:24:45,070
Yeah.

3931
03:24:46,150 --> 03:24:48,310
Yeah, there's like bubbles on his legs.

3932
03:24:48,650 --> 03:24:49,630
You go for those.

3933
03:24:51,590 --> 03:24:51,850
Oh.

3934
03:24:52,290 --> 03:24:54,830
He like blocks his face when you try to attack him.

3935
03:24:54,990 --> 03:24:55,550
It's kind of funny.

3936
03:24:57,590 --> 03:24:58,590
Kind of funny.

3937
03:24:59,070 --> 03:24:59,870
Oops!

3938
03:25:06,250 --> 03:25:06,930
No!

3939
03:25:12,270 --> 03:25:13,030
Oh wait, crap!

3940
03:25:13,450 --> 03:25:14,050
Please!

3941
03:25:17,840 --> 03:25:22,560
Oops, they didn't even give me a thing to avoid, like a way to die.

3942
03:25:23,580 --> 03:25:24,180
Oh.

3943
03:25:25,440 --> 03:25:27,120
Oh, there's some boxes here.

3944
03:25:27,540 --> 03:25:27,960
Please.

3945
03:25:28,520 --> 03:25:30,020
Be kind, gang, please!

3946
03:25:30,300 --> 03:25:30,700
Be kind.

3947
03:25:34,720 --> 03:25:35,400
Boxers.

3948
03:25:38,860 --> 03:25:40,040
Please, I pressed R.

3949
03:25:45,530 --> 03:25:46,030
Ow!

3950
03:25:47,010 --> 03:25:49,390
I know, the camera really messed me up, yeah.

3951
03:25:49,790 --> 03:25:50,270
I know!

3952
03:25:57,130 --> 03:26:00,810
I like how he also attacks the zombies, so it's like...

3953
03:26:00,810 --> 03:26:05,250
Makes it a little easier to get them to kind of just drop stuff sometimes.

3954
03:26:09,390 --> 03:26:09,950
Alright.

3955
03:26:11,230 --> 03:26:11,510
Oh!

3956
03:26:23,390 --> 03:26:23,950
Nice!

3957
03:26:25,090 --> 03:26:27,990
Okay, he should be going after the thing soon, I think.

3958
03:26:29,110 --> 03:26:29,670
Maybe?

3959
03:26:31,110 --> 03:26:32,330
I hope so.

3960
03:26:32,830 --> 03:26:34,150
Oh, yeah, there it is.

3961
03:26:34,290 --> 03:26:35,150
Okay, okay, there he goes.

3962
03:26:35,450 --> 03:26:35,880
Okay, okay.

3963
03:26:36,690 --> 03:26:37,970
That was a little faster.

3964
03:26:42,260 --> 03:26:44,380
Alright, now we stick it into a zombie.

3965
03:26:45,580 --> 03:26:46,420
Yeah, okay.

3966
03:26:48,640 --> 03:26:49,140
Oh, God.

3967
03:26:53,880 --> 03:26:55,560
Come here, come here.

3968
03:26:56,940 --> 03:26:57,920
Alright, eat up.

3969
03:26:58,940 --> 03:26:59,640
Eat up, eat up.

3970
03:27:01,800 --> 03:27:03,720
This thing's pretty powerful though.

3971
03:27:03,880 --> 03:27:04,780
Oh, here it goes.

3972
03:27:05,460 --> 03:27:05,760
Okay.

3973
03:27:07,660 --> 03:27:08,140
Oh

3974
03:27:21,410 --> 03:27:22,210
my gosh.

3975
03:27:23,150 --> 03:27:24,690
I think we gotta get to his face eventually.

3976
03:27:26,830 --> 03:27:28,270
Okay, I'm gonna do the lightning run.

3977
03:27:29,350 --> 03:27:29,790
8%!

3978
03:27:30,290 --> 03:27:30,470
Ow!

3979
03:27:30,630 --> 03:27:30,890
Ow, Josh.

3980
03:27:32,610 --> 03:27:33,090
Uh...

3981
03:27:34,990 --> 03:27:35,750
Oh my gosh.

3982
03:27:35,890 --> 03:27:36,510
No, please!

3983
03:27:36,950 --> 03:27:37,210
No!

3984
03:27:38,830 --> 03:27:39,310
Oh!

3985
03:27:40,470 --> 03:27:40,890
Oh!

3986
03:27:40,890 --> 03:27:40,970
Oh!

3987
03:27:40,970 --> 03:27:41,230
Oh!

3988
03:27:45,050 --> 03:27:45,810
What did I just equip?

3989
03:27:45,930 --> 03:27:47,270
Where's even the head?

3990
03:27:47,930 --> 03:27:49,590
It's the big old buggy eye.

3991
03:27:49,730 --> 03:27:50,790
Look at the red eyes.

3992
03:27:53,650 --> 03:27:54,170
Why?

3993
03:27:54,470 --> 03:27:54,710
No!

3994
03:27:57,530 --> 03:27:58,670
Wait, he'll explode.

3995
03:27:58,810 --> 03:27:59,570
It's in his brain.

3996
03:28:00,690 --> 03:28:01,250
He better.

3997
03:28:06,930 --> 03:28:07,310
Woo!

3998
03:28:12,280 --> 03:28:13,480
Is this the end?

3999
03:28:15,100 --> 03:28:16,460
It's never the end.

4000
03:28:17,260 --> 03:28:17,780
Oh, okay.

4001
03:28:18,240 --> 03:28:18,620
Oh!

4002
03:28:20,160 --> 03:28:20,960
Did you?

4003
03:28:24,760 --> 03:28:26,040
What's his name again?

4004
03:28:26,200 --> 03:28:27,400
I forgot his name.

4005
03:28:27,940 --> 03:28:28,360
Oh, what?

4006
03:28:28,660 --> 03:28:29,400
Why did I do that?

4007
03:28:29,980 --> 03:28:31,900
I keep wanting to call him Stannis.

4008
03:28:32,320 --> 03:28:33,100
I don't know why.

4009
03:28:33,440 --> 03:28:34,880
This is like Sheldon or something.

4010
03:28:36,120 --> 03:28:37,280
Something like a Simmons.

4011
03:28:40,040 --> 03:28:41,680
Oh, it's RPG?

4012
03:28:43,200 --> 03:28:44,300
Yeah, baby.

4013
03:28:46,060 --> 03:28:47,020
Oh, shit.

4014
03:28:48,960 --> 03:28:50,440
This will help, though.

4015
03:28:50,760 --> 03:28:51,300
Bazinga.

4016
03:28:51,820 --> 03:28:52,560
Trish.

4017
03:28:53,340 --> 03:28:54,020
Trish.

4018
03:28:55,220 --> 03:28:55,700
Sorry.

4019
03:29:01,020 --> 03:29:01,700
Oh!

4020
03:29:04,980 --> 03:29:05,920
I got one!

4021
03:29:06,340 --> 03:29:06,520
Oh!

4022
03:29:08,740 --> 03:29:08,980
Oh!

4023
03:29:09,120 --> 03:29:09,560
Oh, that's it.

4024
03:29:09,860 --> 03:29:10,780
They don't give us any more?

4025
03:29:11,220 --> 03:29:11,760
Oh, cool!

4026
03:29:12,140 --> 03:29:12,700
Yeah!

4027
03:29:13,700 --> 03:29:15,280
Right in the kisser.

4028
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:21,380
I feel like everything only makes me stronger though.

4029
03:29:21,500 --> 03:29:21,820
I know.

4030
03:29:23,020 --> 03:29:24,840
Oh, he's getting stripped alive!

4031
03:29:25,380 --> 03:29:26,060
Yeah.

4032
03:29:27,380 --> 03:29:28,880
How is she still...

4033
03:29:29,420 --> 03:29:29,980
A human.

4034
03:29:31,380 --> 03:29:32,640
I knew it!

4035
03:29:33,200 --> 03:29:35,480
I called it!

4036
03:29:35,720 --> 03:29:36,960
You called it!

4037
03:29:40,560 --> 03:29:42,220
He's not Al-Gaib.

4038
03:29:44,530 --> 03:29:46,360
His skewered, Bozo.

4039
03:29:49,380 --> 03:29:50,740
Oh my goodness.

4040
03:29:54,640 --> 03:29:56,480
Whoa, that's a lot of blood.

4041
03:29:56,580 --> 03:29:58,660
It covered it so fast.

4042
03:29:58,820 --> 03:30:00,160
Like a ritual.

4043
03:30:00,260 --> 03:30:01,760
Oh, it's becoming the umbrella.

4044
03:30:02,180 --> 03:30:04,760
It's like, oh, yeah, it is.

4045
03:30:05,320 --> 03:30:06,580
What does it mean?

4046
03:30:07,240 --> 03:30:08,620
Is this the cure?

4047
03:30:12,500 --> 03:30:13,840
Dun, dun, dun.

4048
03:30:16,680 --> 03:30:18,340
It's never over.

4049
03:30:18,980 --> 03:30:19,920
I know.

4050
03:30:21,460 --> 03:30:23,060
That's for my sister.

4051
03:30:24,200 --> 03:30:24,700
Nice.

4052
03:30:25,140 --> 03:30:25,440
Yeah.

4053
03:30:26,420 --> 03:30:27,460
Come on.

4054
03:30:27,580 --> 03:30:28,800
Let's get to the chopper.

4055
03:30:29,420 --> 03:30:31,940
I like how he just doesn't call it a helicopter.

4056
03:30:32,840 --> 03:30:33,040
Yeah.

4057
03:30:34,480 --> 03:30:36,860
In an action movie, you only call it the chopper.

4058
03:30:37,520 --> 03:30:38,400
They took my bullet!

4059
03:30:39,820 --> 03:30:41,800
I didn't use my missile.

4060
03:30:41,960 --> 03:30:42,660
Oh, you didn't?

4061
03:30:42,920 --> 03:30:44,740
I thought we both used it.

4062
03:30:45,540 --> 03:30:47,100
They took it away from me though.

4063
03:30:47,160 --> 03:30:48,280
I wanted to keep it.

4064
03:30:48,820 --> 03:30:50,260
I was saving it for later.

4065
03:30:50,660 --> 03:30:51,220
What is that?

4066
03:30:52,500 --> 03:30:53,780
Oh, a little like mirror.

4067
03:30:54,560 --> 03:30:55,240
Pocket mirror.

4068
03:30:58,940 --> 03:31:01,320
Get to the chopper.

4069
03:31:03,040 --> 03:31:04,820
Maybe this is why he's baby girl.

4070
03:31:09,320 --> 03:31:10,520
The cure?

4071
03:31:11,480 --> 03:31:13,520
Why give away the mirror?

4072
03:31:14,260 --> 03:31:15,920
Because she'll use it.

4073
03:31:18,040 --> 03:31:19,780
Leon, this is...

4074
03:31:19,780 --> 03:31:21,460
Evidence that proves Simmons' guilt.

4075
03:31:21,920 --> 03:31:23,560
She means it will prove your innocence.

4076
03:31:24,180 --> 03:31:25,380
Wait, who do we show this to?

4077
03:31:25,460 --> 03:31:26,380
Who is still alive?

4078
03:31:26,480 --> 03:31:27,420
I don't even know.

4079
03:31:28,160 --> 03:31:28,480
Ow.

4080
03:31:28,820 --> 03:31:29,820
I mean, it's...

4081
03:31:30,340 --> 03:31:30,760
Lina.

4082
03:31:32,720 --> 03:31:33,460
Lina, Lina, Lina.

4083
03:31:34,040 --> 03:31:34,880
Good news, Lina.

4084
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:37,120
We found a way to defeat the virus.

4085
03:31:37,400 --> 03:31:38,800
Oh no!

4086
03:31:39,120 --> 03:31:39,800
Thank goodness!

4087
03:31:40,920 --> 03:31:42,640
Yeah, couldn't she like do this somewhere else?

4088
03:31:42,880 --> 03:31:43,560
Let's not explode.

4089
03:31:46,300 --> 03:31:48,680
Are you gonna drive this time?

4090
03:31:49,040 --> 03:31:50,240
Mr. John President.

4091
03:31:50,600 --> 03:31:50,820
Yeah.

4092
03:31:51,180 --> 03:31:51,740
Yeah.

4093
03:31:51,740 --> 03:31:53,000
Because the president's dead.

4094
03:31:53,820 --> 03:31:54,300
Simmons is dead.

4095
03:31:54,320 --> 03:31:56,260
I mean, there was probably a vice president, right?

4096
03:31:56,760 --> 03:31:57,820
Yeah, true.

4097
03:31:58,780 --> 03:31:58,800
Yeah.

4098
03:32:02,440 --> 03:32:03,420
You're controlled.

4099
03:32:03,640 --> 03:32:03,980
Oh, yeah.

4100
03:32:05,460 --> 03:32:07,720
Look how he's sitting so proud.

4101
03:32:23,000 --> 03:32:23,660
Yahoo!

4102
03:32:26,600 --> 03:32:30,640
I hope the cure is easy to make and distribute.

4103
03:32:31,300 --> 03:32:31,480
Right.

4104
03:32:33,020 --> 03:32:33,920
Oh, my gosh.

4105
03:32:34,100 --> 03:32:35,020
The music's so funky.

4106
03:32:35,320 --> 03:32:36,220
This is music.

4107
03:32:37,240 --> 03:32:38,620
We did it.

4108
03:32:39,020 --> 03:32:39,780
Yay!

4109
03:32:40,680 --> 03:32:40,960
Yay!

4110
03:32:43,700 --> 03:32:44,500
Yippee!

4111
03:32:47,420 --> 03:32:48,220
Wow.

4112
03:32:49,460 --> 03:32:50,400
What a trip.

4113
03:32:51,760 --> 03:32:53,640
Sounds just like my royalty-free.

4114
03:32:54,040 --> 03:32:54,560
I know.

4115
03:32:54,900 --> 03:32:56,100
Funky music.

4116
03:33:07,160 --> 03:33:09,120
Wow, that was so fun, actually.

4117
03:33:09,420 --> 03:33:10,920
That was very silly.

4118
03:33:11,180 --> 03:33:11,400
Yeah.

4119
03:33:14,580 --> 03:33:15,840
I like how it's so fun.

4120
03:33:15,860 --> 03:33:17,540
just the same picture in the background.

4121
03:33:17,660 --> 03:33:19,440
Isn't that the president when he transformed?

4122
03:33:20,160 --> 03:33:20,940
Oh, is it?

4123
03:33:21,360 --> 03:33:22,520
My trauma.

4124
03:33:24,220 --> 03:33:26,260
My traumatic memories.

4125
03:33:26,560 --> 03:33:28,620
I didn't think Leon was such like a...

4126
03:33:28,620 --> 03:33:29,980
She was so into the president.

4127
03:33:30,200 --> 03:33:31,200
He was so sad about it.

4128
03:33:31,200 --> 03:33:32,120
I know he really was.

4129
03:33:32,220 --> 03:33:34,300
He was like 70,000 people died.

4130
03:33:34,680 --> 03:33:36,600
But most importantly, the president died.

4131
03:33:39,940 --> 03:33:40,780
No lives.

4132
03:33:40,960 --> 03:33:43,060
That's what the president's life is worth.

4133
03:33:43,200 --> 03:33:43,820
70,000 people.

4134
03:33:43,820 --> 03:33:44,480
Yeah, right?

4135
03:33:45,220 --> 03:33:45,700
Mm-hmm.

4136
03:33:50,330 --> 03:33:52,950
I feel like I still don't know what happened.

4137
03:33:55,210 --> 03:34:04,190
Mr. Simmons invented a virus to wage war and destabilize the world.

4138
03:34:04,790 --> 03:34:05,610
And then...

4139
03:34:05,610 --> 03:34:07,170
What was his end goal?

4140
03:34:07,730 --> 03:34:08,330
I don't know.

4141
03:34:08,750 --> 03:34:09,890
Take over the world.

4142
03:34:10,230 --> 03:34:10,990
Or, oh, I don't know.

4143
03:34:11,110 --> 03:34:13,230
Avoid a fate worse than this.

4144
03:34:13,470 --> 03:34:14,370
So he says.

4145
03:34:14,950 --> 03:34:15,550
Okay.

4146
03:34:18,470 --> 03:34:20,610
It's explained in other endings.

4147
03:34:24,250 --> 03:34:26,170
I see, I see.

4148
03:34:26,750 --> 03:34:28,150
Was in love with fake Ada?

4149
03:34:28,590 --> 03:34:28,890
Was he?

4150
03:34:29,950 --> 03:34:31,530
The one born from an egg?

4151
03:34:32,570 --> 03:34:33,810
I can understand that.

4152
03:34:34,030 --> 03:34:35,610
Wait, so was Ada...

4153
03:34:35,610 --> 03:34:38,330
There were two Edas, right?

4154
03:34:38,770 --> 03:34:39,250
Yes.

4155
03:34:39,830 --> 03:34:41,750
Egg Ada and normal Ada.

4156
03:34:41,930 --> 03:34:42,410
I think.

4157
03:34:42,650 --> 03:34:43,350
I don't know.

4158
03:34:43,810 --> 03:34:44,410
It has to be.

4159
03:34:44,430 --> 03:34:47,690
Maybe he was in love with Ada and so he birthed his own Ada.

4160
03:34:47,710 --> 03:34:58,690
because she wouldn't love him yeah so he was like i'll make my own yeah he will love me i'll give um yeah i want evil egg ada instead oh

4161
03:35:03,920 --> 03:35:22,340
okay because she was wearing a different outfit i just thought she changed no no cartoon characters only wear one outfit that's true otherwise it's too confusing for our feeble minds yes exactly Wait, that's exactly the plot?

4162
03:35:25,660 --> 03:35:26,280
I understand.

4163
03:35:26,880 --> 03:35:27,760
It's love.

4164
03:35:29,180 --> 03:35:30,840
It drives people a little cuckoo.

4165
03:35:31,320 --> 03:35:31,560
Mm-hmm.

4166
03:35:36,280 --> 03:35:39,320
I think Leon and Helena should be together.

4167
03:35:39,620 --> 03:35:41,460
Ada doesn't seem very committed.

4168
03:35:41,760 --> 03:35:43,560
You know, she keeps running off.

4169
03:35:44,160 --> 03:35:45,060
That's true.

4170
03:35:45,480 --> 03:35:47,240
Maybe he enjoys the chase.

4171
03:35:47,880 --> 03:35:51,920
He probably does, but Helena and Leon have, like, shared trauma now.

4172
03:35:52,060 --> 03:35:53,720
You know, that they can bond with you?

4173
03:35:54,860 --> 03:35:56,060
Yeah, yeah.

4174
03:35:57,100 --> 03:35:59,640
But we don't know what Ada and Leon have.

4175
03:36:00,440 --> 03:36:01,160
That's true.

4176
03:36:03,740 --> 03:36:04,960
They could have anything.

4177
03:36:05,460 --> 03:36:06,700
They could have anything.

4178
03:36:07,960 --> 03:36:09,620
Helena was never seen again?

4179
03:36:09,940 --> 03:36:10,400
Why?

4180
03:36:10,780 --> 03:36:12,860
Is she like side character treatment?

4181
03:36:14,400 --> 03:36:15,340
Why not?

4182
03:36:15,980 --> 03:36:17,080
That's not fair.

4183
03:36:19,220 --> 03:36:21,480
Maybe people didn't like her as much as Ada.

4184
03:36:22,500 --> 03:36:23,620
Oh my gosh, Chris Zimmerman.

4185
03:36:25,380 --> 03:36:31,840
who's that if that's chris zimmerman of metal gear solid fan oh

4186
03:36:38,040 --> 03:37:01,260
now the music's spooky it is here's the horror they said that there's a post credits scene oh really okay yeah i just got a ding that popped up that says skip so did you yeah it just came up we'll uh we'll look through all the fun credits.

4187
03:37:04,100 --> 03:37:06,880
Thanks to the team who made the game.

4188
03:37:08,020 --> 03:37:11,320
I do love me some Resident Evil, even if it's silly.

4189
03:37:12,240 --> 03:37:13,360
This was so funny.

4190
03:37:13,620 --> 03:37:14,520
It was so fun.

4191
03:37:15,400 --> 03:37:16,760
You should play seven.

4192
03:37:17,420 --> 03:37:18,760
It's not so scary, though.

4193
03:37:19,560 --> 03:37:20,840
Yes, it's terrifying.

4194
03:37:21,480 --> 03:37:26,540
I actually tried seven, like, two seconds in VR.

4195
03:37:27,860 --> 03:38:28,300
Oh, is even worse it was not possible for me yeah do you get scared are you good with horror um i do get scared but i love horror i'm the same i love it but i also get scared yeah resident evil 7 is so good you have to play it if you love horror it's really good that's why i actually never played resident evil games but because i thought they were too action-y and like seven is very horror yeah and then seven seven got released and i was like okay resident evil i see you i see you i want to play next probably the resident evil 4 is what has been yeah i want to play too yeah it's been recommended and there's a new one coming out right they just announced it yeah yeah it was announced i don't know anything about it though but it showed like raccoon city so also we're going back to Raccoon City.

4196
03:38:28,500 --> 03:38:29,420
I guess so.

4197
03:38:29,940 --> 03:38:34,060
I only know, like, seven and eight, which I feel like are completely different.

4198
03:38:36,160 --> 03:38:39,480
Seven, no, eight is the village?

4199
03:38:40,540 --> 03:38:43,180
Yes, with the tall vampire lady.

4200
03:38:43,380 --> 03:38:43,820
Yeah.

4201
03:38:46,140 --> 03:38:49,080
Like, yeah, it's very different, I think.

4202
03:38:49,080 --> 03:38:50,360
Right, it's so different.

4203
03:38:50,760 --> 03:38:54,340
Like, it feels like it's a completely different set, like, time, too.

4204
03:38:54,440 --> 03:38:56,200
It feels like medieval.

4205
03:38:57,380 --> 03:39:25,860
just like half of the game here that's true actually that's real this one was fun though in our strange bizarro indiana jones way i know so i guess this one and five are actually i don't know about one through four though uh one is if you play wait they didn't remake one right i don't know One is...

4206
03:39:25,860 --> 03:39:27,980
Did they remake four and two?

4207
03:39:28,920 --> 03:39:30,100
One is hard.

4208
03:39:31,320 --> 03:39:33,680
It's like very old school.

4209
03:39:34,940 --> 03:39:37,780
And the camera angles are really hard.

4210
03:39:38,180 --> 03:39:38,540
No.

4211
03:39:39,560 --> 03:39:41,440
Oh, they did, just not in the RE engine.

4212
03:39:42,100 --> 03:39:42,280
Oh.

4213
03:39:43,880 --> 03:39:45,040
HD remake.

4214
03:39:49,980 --> 03:39:53,500
I played a little bit of one when I was a kid.

4215
03:39:53,660 --> 03:39:54,920
I remember being like, I don't know.

4216
03:39:54,940 --> 03:40:29,460
don't know it was hard i know i didn't play any of these kinds of games as a kid i only played gamecube only nintendo i didn't i didn't that's the thing i didn't have like gamecube n64 i had a do you have a playstation kid yeah it was a playstation kid my dad was kind of funny because he's like if something is popular he wants to not get He was like a kind of a hipster,

4217
03:40:29,820 --> 03:40:30,420
but...

4218
03:40:30,420 --> 03:40:30,460
Uh-huh.

4219
03:40:30,820 --> 03:40:32,800
So like when I asked for a...

4220
03:40:32,800 --> 03:40:37,400
For an iPod, my dad was like, No, you're gonna get this Zune.

4221
03:40:38,680 --> 03:40:40,400
What is a Zune?

4222
03:40:41,180 --> 03:40:42,480
What is a Zune?

4223
03:40:43,760 --> 03:40:47,860
And so that's why he was just like, No, Nintendo's too popular.

4224
03:40:48,020 --> 03:40:48,960
You're gonna get a PlayStation.

4225
03:40:50,420 --> 03:40:52,080
PlayStation's popular too, though.

4226
03:40:52,100 --> 03:40:52,380
I know.

4227
03:40:53,560 --> 03:40:56,640
But maybe because all the kids were like, I want to play the Nintendo.

4228
03:40:57,420 --> 03:40:57,880
Yeah.

4229
03:40:58,920 --> 03:40:59,380
Yeah.

4230
03:41:03,880 --> 03:41:09,960
I was a Nintendo kid, but I was always excited when I went over to my friend's house who had a PlayStation.

4231
03:41:10,620 --> 03:41:11,460
Because I got to...

4232
03:41:11,460 --> 03:41:12,700
Left 4 Dead 2 content.

4233
03:41:13,040 --> 03:41:14,820
There's Left 4 Dead 2 content in here?

4234
03:41:17,880 --> 03:41:20,720
I would get to go see all the PlayStation games.

4235
03:41:20,960 --> 03:41:21,480
Oh, yeah.

4236
03:41:21,620 --> 03:41:23,040
I would do that with my friend.

4237
03:41:23,720 --> 03:41:24,120
Yeah.

4238
03:41:25,980 --> 03:41:26,960
What was your...

4239
03:41:26,980 --> 03:41:28,620
What was your go-to Nintendo game?

4240
03:41:30,180 --> 03:41:36,700
Hmm, probably Sonic Adventure 2 and Billy Hatcher and...

4241
03:41:36,700 --> 03:41:40,000
I loved the Narnia game for the GameCube.

4242
03:41:41,400 --> 03:41:43,280
It's so good.

4243
03:41:43,460 --> 03:41:43,880
Huh.

4244
03:41:46,340 --> 03:41:48,320
None of the Nintendo titles.

4245
03:41:49,300 --> 03:41:50,640
Wait, these are Nintendo?

4246
03:41:51,100 --> 03:41:51,960
Are they not?

4247
03:41:52,640 --> 03:41:55,860
Well, I mean, like, I meant like Mario or...

4248
03:41:55,860 --> 03:41:56,960
Mario, I don't know.

4249
03:41:56,980 --> 03:41:58,840
I only like the newer Mario.

4250
03:42:01,220 --> 03:42:03,100
Oh, Animal Crossing!

4251
03:42:03,380 --> 03:42:03,800
Yeah.

4252
03:42:04,840 --> 03:42:06,060
Animal Crossing?

4253
03:42:06,460 --> 03:42:10,260
Honestly, I did play mostly like shovelware, I think.

4254
03:42:10,420 --> 03:42:12,140
You should replay the Narnia Jam.

4255
03:42:12,960 --> 03:42:13,780
I'm going to.

4256
03:42:13,900 --> 03:42:14,840
I'm going to.

4257
03:42:15,140 --> 03:42:15,460
Yes.

4258
03:42:16,020 --> 03:42:17,480
I have it.

4259
03:42:19,800 --> 03:42:21,580
She's doing so loud.

4260
03:42:22,860 --> 03:42:25,020
Oh, the lovey lovey.

4261
03:42:25,220 --> 03:42:25,840
Ada Leon.

4262
03:42:28,080 --> 03:42:30,520
Oh, look at her red shirt.

4263
03:42:30,980 --> 03:42:31,060
I know.

4264
03:42:32,200 --> 03:42:33,340
And her necklace.

4265
03:42:33,940 --> 03:42:35,620
It's vampire vibes.

4266
03:42:38,340 --> 03:42:42,560
Oh, the Shrek 2 game.

4267
03:42:43,560 --> 03:42:45,420
Oh, that one was a classic.

4268
03:42:45,900 --> 03:42:47,020
Yeah, Shrek 2.

4269
03:42:47,560 --> 03:42:49,600
This is Soul Metal Gear right now.

4270
03:42:50,680 --> 03:42:51,120
Oh.

4271
03:42:55,860 --> 03:42:56,620
Is that Leon?

4272
03:42:56,900 --> 03:42:57,960
See, they're still friends.

4273
03:42:58,300 --> 03:43:22,360
It's time for me to take responsibility what's that mean there's like places that aren't infected and crazy well they found the cure right everything's good yes so yeah thank you oh my gosh secret agents where's she going to jail

4274
03:43:26,090 --> 03:43:39,070
the handcuffs oh i thought it was handcuffs i assisted me attack It sounded like it too, like it was like clicking on her list.

4275
03:43:39,170 --> 03:43:42,130
It's just to hold you liable for Simmons' crime.

4276
03:43:42,710 --> 03:43:45,590
They will also not be disclosing their findings to the public.

4277
03:43:46,710 --> 03:43:48,250
The president would have done the same.

4278
03:43:48,970 --> 03:43:49,110
Oh.

4279
03:43:49,750 --> 03:43:51,470
He's in love with the president.

4280
03:43:56,790 --> 03:43:57,170
Aw.

4281
03:43:57,570 --> 03:43:58,690
Shall we go join the team?

4282
03:44:02,050 --> 03:44:03,110
Except you, Helena.

4283
03:44:03,310 --> 03:44:04,890
You're not allowed in future games.

4284
03:44:05,610 --> 03:44:05,850
Aw.

4285
03:44:05,850 --> 03:44:13,970
Leon The mirror For the next time you see her.

4286
03:44:14,010 --> 03:44:26,350
Oh Worth his relationship She's shipping them What do you mean by the Leon?

4287
03:44:27,470 --> 03:44:35,330
All she did was give back the thing I know she just did something so nice Why is that the last line of the game?

4288
03:44:37,010 --> 03:44:38,850
Women, am I right?

4289
03:44:40,530 --> 03:44:42,430
Oh my gosh, I got an A.

4290
03:44:44,890 --> 03:44:46,190
Also, look at all the A.

4291
03:44:46,470 --> 03:44:47,630
The enemies you killed.

4292
03:44:47,870 --> 03:44:48,870
Oh my gosh.

4293
03:44:50,090 --> 03:44:51,150
Let's go!

4294
03:44:51,790 --> 03:44:53,670
Hey, I passed.

4295
03:44:54,610 --> 03:44:55,910
C's get degrees.

4296
03:44:57,650 --> 03:44:57,950
Good.

4297
03:44:59,490 --> 03:45:01,310
Good job, Mim.

4298
03:45:01,650 --> 03:45:03,310
Good job, Mimmy.

4299
03:45:03,710 --> 03:45:04,310
Also.

4300
03:45:05,990 --> 03:45:07,910
I know.

4301
03:45:11,990 --> 03:45:17,470
I'm so excited for your new outfit coming up.

4302
03:45:17,910 --> 03:45:18,390
Yeah.

4303
03:45:19,690 --> 03:45:20,750
I'm so excited.

4304
03:45:21,590 --> 03:45:22,910
Me too.

4305
03:45:23,610 --> 03:45:24,350
I'm nervous.

4306
03:45:25,190 --> 03:45:26,270
On Saturday, right?

4307
03:45:26,730 --> 03:45:28,470
Yes, Saturday.

4308
03:45:30,390 --> 03:45:34,590
And next week we have a cover coming out together!

4309
03:45:35,850 --> 03:45:36,290
Yes!

4310
03:45:36,530 --> 03:45:37,410
I'm invited!

4311
03:45:37,790 --> 03:45:38,610
You too!

4312
03:45:39,250 --> 03:45:40,010
Oh my gosh.

4313
03:45:40,270 --> 03:45:41,230
The good one.

4314
03:45:42,450 --> 03:45:43,630
It's so cute.

4315
03:45:44,310 --> 03:45:45,370
It is cute.

4316
03:45:45,990 --> 03:45:47,690
Thank you for inviting me.

4317
03:45:47,770 --> 03:45:48,750
You can do it.

4318
03:45:48,930 --> 03:45:50,690
I was like...

4319
03:45:50,690 --> 03:45:53,930
As soon as I heard the song, I was like, who can I sing this with?

4320
03:45:54,030 --> 03:45:55,270
And I was like, Wait.

4321
03:45:55,750 --> 03:45:57,350
This is so perfect for Nimi.

4322
03:45:57,910 --> 03:46:00,630
It kind of is perfect for us, I think.

4323
03:46:02,470 --> 03:46:03,910
It's kind of working so well.

4324
03:46:04,630 --> 03:46:05,030
Yeah.

4325
03:46:06,130 --> 03:46:06,670
Yeah!

4326
03:46:07,810 --> 03:46:08,350
But...

4327
03:46:08,350 --> 03:46:09,650
This was a lot of fun.

4328
03:46:10,430 --> 03:46:11,630
This was fun!

4329
03:46:12,830 --> 03:46:13,890
Thanks for playing.

4330
03:46:14,330 --> 03:46:14,590
Yeah!

4331
03:46:15,430 --> 03:46:16,690
You all suggested it.

4332
03:46:16,810 --> 03:46:17,490
Good suggestion.

4333
03:46:18,510 --> 03:46:21,250
I wanted to play some of the, like, co-op Resident Evils.

4334
03:46:21,550 --> 03:46:24,410
I had no idea what we were getting ourselves into, though.

4335
03:46:26,990 --> 03:46:28,910
It was... it was something.

4336
03:46:29,810 --> 03:46:30,330
It was.

4337
03:46:30,570 --> 03:46:31,550
It was something.

4338
03:46:32,430 --> 03:46:35,550
I actually appreciated, though, how linear it was.

4339
03:46:35,850 --> 03:46:39,050
I didn't have, I feel like I had to be brainy or anything so.

4340
03:46:39,230 --> 03:46:40,650
Right, it was very head empty.

4341
03:46:41,650 --> 03:46:43,910
Run to the next space and shoot stuff.

4342
03:46:44,090 --> 03:46:45,430
Yeah, it was nice.

4343
03:46:47,590 --> 03:46:48,150
So.

4344
03:46:51,250 --> 03:46:52,670
And now we know.

4345
03:46:53,350 --> 03:46:54,290
Now we know.

4346
03:46:56,010 --> 03:47:00,510
That was my first resident, first, first true resident evil experience.

4347
03:47:00,710 --> 03:47:01,350
Wait, really?

4348
03:47:01,630 --> 03:47:02,070
Yeah.

4349
03:47:02,650 --> 03:47:03,170
No.

4350
03:47:06,330 --> 03:47:07,430
This was?

4351
03:47:07,590 --> 03:47:08,050
Yeah.

4352
03:47:08,370 --> 03:47:08,910
No!

4353
03:47:11,570 --> 03:47:12,010
Ow.

4354
03:47:12,730 --> 03:47:14,170
We did it all today.

4355
03:47:14,730 --> 03:47:15,910
You have to play seven.

4356
03:47:16,270 --> 03:47:17,430
You have to play seven.

4357
03:47:17,650 --> 03:47:18,570
Okay, I'll play seven.

4358
03:47:19,490 --> 03:47:19,710
I'll play it.

4359
03:47:19,910 --> 03:47:20,590
It's so good.

4360
03:47:20,910 --> 03:47:21,150
Okay.

4361
03:47:21,550 --> 03:47:22,170
For you.

4362
03:47:22,310 --> 03:47:23,890
You can watch.

4363
03:47:24,190 --> 03:47:24,770
You can like...

4364
03:47:24,770 --> 03:47:25,830
I will watch.

4365
03:47:26,390 --> 03:47:27,690
I will backseat you.

4366
03:47:27,690 --> 03:47:27,970
Okay.

4367
03:47:28,570 --> 03:47:28,890
Yeah, yeah.

4368
03:47:29,010 --> 03:47:29,810
In voice chat.

4369
03:47:30,350 --> 03:47:30,750
Okay.

4370
03:47:31,630 --> 03:47:34,170
I'll be like, there's an herb over there.

4371
03:47:34,590 --> 03:47:34,910
Yeah.

4372
03:47:36,310 --> 03:47:36,790
Okay.

4373
03:47:37,010 --> 03:47:38,250
I will do seven then.

4374
03:47:39,050 --> 03:47:39,610
Please.

4375
03:47:42,870 --> 03:47:43,990
I guess...

4376
03:47:43,990 --> 03:47:45,610
Is this the last game with Leon?

4377
03:47:47,070 --> 03:47:47,870
I guess so.

4378
03:47:47,970 --> 03:47:48,630
He's not in.

4379
03:47:48,910 --> 03:47:49,530
It's Ethan.

4380
03:47:50,050 --> 03:47:50,610
Ethan.

4381
03:47:51,950 --> 03:47:52,310
Ethan.

4382
03:47:53,710 --> 03:47:53,830
Hmm.

4383
03:47:54,210 --> 03:47:54,850
In seven.

4384
03:47:55,790 --> 03:47:56,910
Yeah, for now.

4385
03:47:57,170 --> 03:47:57,990
Oh, Leon.

4386
03:47:58,970 --> 03:47:59,250
Yeah.

4387
03:47:59,750 --> 03:48:02,850
Yeah, maybe they're coming back in nine.

4388
03:48:03,690 --> 03:48:03,870
Yeah.

4389
03:48:04,170 --> 03:48:04,870
Raccoon City?

4390
03:48:05,150 --> 03:48:05,830
I think he will.

4391
03:48:05,950 --> 03:48:06,350
I think you...

4392
03:48:06,350 --> 03:48:08,270
I think they're saving it for like a big reason.

4393
03:48:10,690 --> 03:48:12,990
So, I guess we'll see him again.

4394
03:48:13,210 --> 03:48:13,390
I think.

4395
03:48:13,590 --> 03:48:13,670
Yeah.

4396
03:48:15,030 --> 03:48:16,770
Will we see Ada again?

4397
03:48:17,350 --> 03:48:18,870
Yeah, we have to.

4398
03:48:20,410 --> 03:48:21,350
I want to.

4399
03:48:21,430 --> 03:48:22,630
I ship it.

4400
03:48:23,670 --> 03:48:26,130
I've seen them for two seconds and I ship it.

4401
03:48:26,310 --> 03:48:26,950
Yeah, right.

4402
03:48:27,950 --> 03:48:29,470
I'd like to see more.

4403
03:48:30,030 --> 03:48:30,630
Yeah.

4404
03:48:35,900 --> 03:48:36,800
Me too.

4405
03:48:40,520 --> 03:49:04,680

4406
03:49:08,020 --> 03:49:10,280
Thank you, Demi, for playing with me.

4407
03:49:10,720 --> 03:49:12,620
Thank you, Min, thank you.

4408
03:49:13,740 --> 03:49:15,260
It was so much fun.

4409
03:49:15,620 --> 03:49:17,680
Let's play something else soon.

4410
03:49:20,440 --> 03:49:20,960
Okay.

4411
03:49:21,820 --> 03:49:22,480
Oh, wait.

4412
03:49:22,520 --> 03:49:23,840
I'll see you later then.

4413
03:49:24,480 --> 03:49:25,580
Yeah, see you later.

4414
03:49:26,260 --> 03:49:26,400
Okay.

4415
03:49:27,860 --> 03:49:28,520
Bye-bye.

4416
03:49:28,740 --> 03:49:29,380
Bye-bye.

4417
03:49:30,760 --> 03:49:30,820
Bye-bye.

4418
03:49:30,820 --> 03:49:31,180
Bye-bye.

4419
03:49:32,060 --> 03:49:32,700
Bye-bye.

4420
03:49:32,740 --> 03:49:33,140
Bye-bye.

4421
03:49:33,520 --> 03:49:33,780
Bye-bye.

4422
03:49:34,340 --> 03:49:34,600
Oh,

4423
03:49:40,760 --> 03:49:40,760
bye.

4424
03:49:41,060 --> 03:49:41,440
Hold on.

4425
03:49:43,680 --> 03:49:45,100
Before she disappears.

4426
03:49:48,520 --> 03:49:49,000
There we go.

4427
03:49:49,280 --> 03:49:50,100
It's us.

4428
03:49:50,640 --> 03:49:52,420
Wait, I want to hold her hand.

4429
03:49:54,320 --> 03:49:55,540
Wait, is she big?

4430
03:49:56,180 --> 03:49:57,080
There we go.

4431
03:49:57,380 --> 03:49:59,100
Maybe this is better.

4432
03:49:59,980 --> 03:50:01,500
She's a little taller than me.

4433
03:50:01,860 --> 03:50:02,500
Like that.

4434
03:50:02,660 --> 03:50:03,580
This is accurate.

4435
03:50:04,720 --> 03:50:05,040
Wait.

4436
03:50:05,620 --> 03:50:07,340
Oh, my hand can't touch hers.

4437
03:50:07,940 --> 03:50:08,480
Yay!

4438
03:50:09,360 --> 03:50:10,520
I'm going to close the game.

4439
03:50:12,960 --> 03:50:14,860
So we're just here.

4440
03:50:15,500 --> 03:50:16,120
Twins!

4441
03:50:16,720 --> 03:50:19,200
Duh, enemy's so cute.

4442
03:50:21,560 --> 03:50:25,000
She's bigger than you for sure.

4443
03:50:29,980 --> 03:50:30,860
For sure?

4444
03:50:48,050 --> 03:50:49,330
Hmm.

4445
03:50:52,690 --> 03:50:53,970
Maybe.

4446
03:50:59,490 --> 03:51:09,430
baby well what if I do this my sleeves are bigger

4447
03:51:15,390 --> 03:52:33,310

4448
03:52:33,970 --> 03:52:36,970
I was like, Maddie, you know Resident Evil, which one should I star with?

4449
03:52:37,090 --> 03:52:37,870
And she said four.

4450
03:52:38,390 --> 03:52:42,390
I trust Maddie, so Maddie is, oh, that's Raspberry on Twitter.

4451
03:52:43,970 --> 03:52:50,470
She makes very funny Metal Gear comics and Resident Evil comics and comics about anything that she likes.

4452
03:52:51,670 --> 03:52:51,870
Remake?

4453
03:52:52,010 --> 03:52:53,130
She said either.

4454
03:52:54,350 --> 03:52:56,290
I think she said the original, honestly.

4455
03:52:57,430 --> 03:52:58,510
I kind of wanted to play the

4456
03:53:03,770 --> 03:53:33,450
yeah 4 is the easiest entry point what is well I'm gonna look it up I'll look up what the I feel like Resident Evil is more difficult than Metal Gear because it's kind of like it's like Metal Gear is linear but it's not you know what I mean like it's just out of order but there's different characters and stuff in Resident Evil Resident Evil.

4457
03:53:34,510 --> 03:53:35,830
It's not that difficult?

4458
03:53:36,150 --> 03:53:36,430
Really?

4459
03:53:37,150 --> 03:53:39,030
It feels so difficult for me.

4460
03:53:39,970 --> 03:53:41,930
It's so difficult to me.

4461
03:53:42,250 --> 03:53:43,270
Thanks for playing Resident Evil.

4462
03:53:43,410 --> 03:53:45,370
It's one of my favorite series ever, so I see you two enjoy.

4463
03:53:45,450 --> 03:53:46,210
It made me smile.

4464
03:53:47,650 --> 03:53:48,410
Thank you.

4465
03:53:49,830 --> 03:53:51,450
I did have fun, though.

4466
03:53:53,910 --> 03:53:54,270
Hmm.

4467
03:53:55,290 --> 03:53:58,370
So, pretty straightforward.

4468
03:53:59,210 --> 03:54:02,530
Once I learned how to throw grenades and bombs, I felt much better.

4469
03:54:04,950 --> 03:54:22,540
and i got an a every chapter i got an a and i got an s at one point i was i was actually gaming this is what pc gaming is like this is why they say pc master cat in here hold on

4470
03:54:25,610 --> 03:54:28,970

4471
03:54:34,830 --> 03:54:36,410
Five, thank you.

4472
03:54:36,410 --> 03:54:37,190
Thank you, thank you, friend.

4473
03:54:37,430 --> 03:54:38,130
Thank you for the gifts.

4474
03:54:40,330 --> 03:54:45,230
Much like Metal Gear, many folks think that Resident Evil is super serious horror, but is actually surprisingly goofy.

4475
03:54:48,030 --> 03:54:50,770
Though, I think Seven is not quite goofy.

4476
03:54:51,410 --> 03:54:52,270
I think it's very...

4477
03:54:52,270 --> 03:54:55,550
It's got the Metal Gear 5 issue.

4478
03:54:57,410 --> 03:54:58,230
Paz or Butaro?

4479
03:54:58,390 --> 03:54:59,350
I thought it was Paz.

4480
03:55:00,230 --> 03:55:02,790
Because she likes to sit in my window and, like...

4481
03:55:02,810 --> 03:56:15,650
like she likes to sit in my window and just stare at birds but she'll like always mess with the curtains and i looked over and the curtains were messed with i hope there's not another ghost in here this place is occupied seven is pretty goofy really i look so scary though it takes itself seriously until you play the dlc oh but it's the beginning the beginning of the game is so scary it's got some goof oh wait now i'm excited every resident evil has camp you too cute thank you i love goof you guys know me i love i love i don't know i love a good a good mix of goof and camp and seriousness yeah eight is kind of crazy you know four is insanely goof ah okay my resident evil arc begins you just went through the most serious game in the series

4482
03:56:19,290 --> 03:56:20,430
no no

4483
03:56:23,590 --> 03:56:30,950

4484
03:56:31,070 --> 03:56:31,850
Is she saying bye?

4485
03:56:33,070 --> 03:56:34,670
Kimito is cute today.

4486
03:56:35,430 --> 03:56:36,070
Thank you.

4487
03:56:37,130 --> 03:56:38,090
I had a lot of fun.

4488
03:56:38,210 --> 03:56:38,870
I'm going to hug her.

4489
03:56:51,020 --> 03:56:53,160
She was all in my head.

4490
03:56:54,740 --> 03:56:55,920
It's the Batman meme.

4491
03:56:56,560 --> 03:56:57,620
Don't leave me.

4492
03:56:58,560 --> 03:56:59,800
Don't leave me.

4493
03:57:02,200 --> 03:57:03,080
Oh, sorry.

4494
03:57:03,260 --> 03:57:05,040
I got a little too excited there.

4495
03:57:05,600 --> 03:57:06,340
Thank you guys.

4496
03:57:06,520 --> 03:57:07,180
Oh, too, Minto.

4497
