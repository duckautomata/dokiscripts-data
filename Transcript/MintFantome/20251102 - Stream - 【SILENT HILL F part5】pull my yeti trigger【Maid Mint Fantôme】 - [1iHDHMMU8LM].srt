1
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,320
Wait a second.

2
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,680
I'm not ready at all.

3
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,500
I'm not!

4
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,340
Eh?

5
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,820
I'm not...

6
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:33,880
Ah!

7
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,480
Eh?

8
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,620
Why can't I hear anything my headphones?

9
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,020
Eh?

10
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,260
Eh!

11
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
Are you guys hearing me?

12
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:52,450
Ah!

13
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:53,230
Hmm?

14
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,240
They weren't plugged in.

15
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm

16
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,320
sorry, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

17
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,400
I'm sorry, that was me grabbing my controller.

18
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm so...

19
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
Today, holy moly.

20
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,960
Hello, hello, hello.

21
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,960
Hi, hi.

22
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,280
She's trying her best.

23
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:26,640
I am.

24
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm truly trying my best.

25
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
Yori lover.

26
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,780
Welcome to my booshup.

27
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,660
Thank you.

28
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,820
Thank you, thank you.

29
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,980
No, it wasn't disconnected.

30
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,560
Well, what disconnected was the controller because I grabbed them.

31
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,740
So...

32
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,900
I grabbed it off the stand.

33
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,260
So I guess it disconnected from the stand.

34
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,300
But it connected to my computer.

35
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,060
Was that your concert this morning?

36
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,240
They were super cute and evil ghosts.

37
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,670
Got some echo.

38
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,890
Two audio inputs or maybe speakers on side?

39
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,850
Let's have...

40
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,280
Two?

41
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,980
Don't hear any echo?

42
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,340
You might have another window open, Duargo.

43
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,660
You might have a second tab open.

44
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,540
I've done that before.

45
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,600
Or I'm like, why is there an echo?

46
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,580
Been there.

47
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,080
Yeah, this morning I had...

48
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,600
I was at a convention.

49
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,720
U.S.

50
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,360
Idol Festival.

51
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,340
I performed.

52
00:06:47,980 --> 00:07:20,400
for a good happy birthday happy happy birthday happy happy birthday i performed i did a concert and then i just got done with meet and greets like two hours ago no yeah uh wait an hour ago ish hour and a half ago and then i so basically it was the first time i've ever done the meet and greets like this that's probably it thanks for the tech support boy Of course!

53
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,180
I'm pretty tired, yeah.

54
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,300
But that's okay.

55
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,260
Minky fart.

56
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,780
It's my B-Day today.

57
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
Yuri lover.

58
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,680
Happy, happy birthday!

59
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,640
Why do I fart?

60
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:36,800
No fart.

61
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:37,700
No.

62
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:47,060
But, um, the mean greets, I would do the mean greets, and then we would take a picture, and then afterwards I would decorate the picture.

63
00:07:47,080 --> 00:08:14,520
picture so it looks like so then they would print it out on a checkie and um and uh what was i saying um so that took me about an hour afterwards because i was like decorating all of the all of the checkies so that's why i was like oh i finished like an hour and a half ago for the me and Greed,

64
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,800
but then I had homework.

65
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,460
I had homework, so...

66
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,040
Metal Gear in concert was awesome!

67
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,440
Oh my gosh, Roku Yod!

68
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm glad you went.

69
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,120
I hope it comes to somewhere near you in the near future so you can go.

70
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,140
I've been able to go at least to the one in Japan.

71
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,400
And I cried, cried, cried, cried, cried.

72
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,320
So...

73
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,060
Nah, well, thank you so much for the Toa Wari Gifted.

74
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,960
Thank you!

75
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:56,180
Yeah, I'm a little bit tired, but I'm also excited to i didn't want to put up push off um beating silent hill because i was like oh my gosh it's it's been it's been long enough wait over

76
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:14,060

77
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
I recognize that guy.

78
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,200
Thank you so much.

79
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,400
Thank you.

80
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,580
Yeah, I saw you there.

81
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,820
Thank you so much.

82
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,560
Saw the clip of you singing in the chant from the crowd.

83
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,980
Oh, wait, I didn't actually watch the clip yet.

84
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,200
So, thanks so much for making me tear up watching your performance.

85
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,120
Reminds me of a simpler times as a VTuber fan.

86
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,920
Thank you.

87
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,340
Hope you had a happy Halloween, Vinky, going to a party.

88
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
Whoa, have fun, Maddie.

89
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,880
Have fun at your party.

90
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:56,380
Yeah, actually, that song was a last-minute inclusion.

91
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:09,660
I was going to switch out another song for it, and then I was like, wait a second, if I switch out songs, I'll have a lot of time left over, so I decided that I would just do both.

92
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,200
Um...

93
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,920
You know...

94
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,120
I...

95
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,500
I was just like, well, you know...

96
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,520
But here's my thought process.

97
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,940
The concert was very early in the morning.

98
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:35,680
So I wanted to maybe give a little treat to people who woke up early and got there early.

99
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,420
Just to come and see me, I really appreciated it.

100
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,240
So...

101
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:52,180
And then also, um, it's not a song that I will sing probably ever again.

102
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,840
So, but was it truly a little treat?

103
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,700
Truly a little treat.

104
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,000
Um, but yeah, I hope you guys appreciated it.

105
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:24,180
But yeah, yeah, I also wanted to say something else because I feel like, how do I say, I feel like I owe you guys a bit of an apology.

106
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:42,240
You guys are going to be like, don't apologize for you too, but, you know, I just want to say like, um, my, a lot has been going on behind the scenes, like a lot of just stuff that's being planned and also just other stuff.

107
00:11:42,260 --> 00:13:21,960
and so my mental has been kind of like spiraling and i feel like you know i've had it affect my streams a lot lately and um and uh i get especially like brain fogged when i get this way like i i seriously it's hard for me to form coherent thoughts and so um you know sometimes when i get this bad i um i forget i don't it's not that i forget but i lose sight of the fact that um that uh my my number one goal for stream is is just entertainment and so uh um you know usually i'm pretty good about like even if stuff is going on i can just of like flip a switch and be like okay we're going baby let's go but uh lately it's been a little bit harder for me so i apologize um november november definitely november i'm gonna be streaming quite a bit less i'll post my schedule like not a schedule schedule but like kind of a rundown of the month to show you guys um but i'm gonna take the time to like of its work it's not all rest but i'm going to take the time to really like um avoid the burnout that

108
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:47,020
i am feeling i am coming close to so but also happy november happy november i'm sorry i missed halloween uh for real no need to apologize we would rather you communicate than repress well i don't want to bother anybody with anything, so it's okay.

109
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,220
Take care of my Oshibinto, okay.

110
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm trying!

111
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,140
I have bad brainwarp, so.

112
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,780
Yeah.

113
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,500
So, um, hopefully, hopefully.

114
00:14:09,560 --> 00:15:45,040
Hopefully I can this month and next month next month i have a couple days off as well um so by new years we can start all spick and span all shiny and new and hopefully we can bring in 2026 um in a good way i always enjoy your streams but i hope you get the rest you need thank you no i'm sorry some of the stuff though is you know me it's not just it's not just all me taking break it's also some things that i'm working on that will come out eventually so it's non-stop jihongo november ah shumi my scene non-stop nihongo november this and that thank you guys thank you thank you thank you thank you I don't know it's just been like I said usually I can pull myself out of it sometimes I'll like get into a deep funk and it's kind of funny how like my brain works I'll like get into like I will be like yesterday I was like this is so TMI I was like crying the whole day it's so embarrassing I just like couldn't get myself to stop and and uh sometimes like i'll be that way i'll be that way and

115
00:15:45,040 --> 00:16:01,660
then i'll be like and then i'll be like okay like i it's so strange i'll be sitting there crying crying crying and then like five minutes later i'll just sit there and i'll be like okay i'm done feeling bad for myself i'm fine now

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:34,860

117
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,060
I'm normal now.

118
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,800
Yeah, exactly.

119
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,540
So, sorry that.

120
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:04,600
I feel like for the past couple of weeks, honestly, I've been like, uh, so, um, foggy-brained.

121
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,620
What I should be is froggy-brained.

122
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,180
You know?

123
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,680
But today, we are finishing Silent Hill F finally.

124
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,760
Oh my gosh, I'm like the slowest person.

125
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:25,080
I think I'm the only person that hasn't finished this game yet.

126
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,260
So, oh, oh, why am I lagging?

127
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,000
What's happening?

128
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,960
Why am I lagging?

129
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,580
Thank you guys for all this.

130
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,940
Super chance, thank you.

131
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,480
Hold on.

132
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,080
Let me see if there's anything that...

133
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,740
Sorry, I just saw this picture I took.

134
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,680
Of...

135
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,180
Look at this picture I took.

136
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,820
Sorry, whoever this is.

137
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,400
I was taking screenshots of the idol festival stage.

138
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't wait to see that picture.

139
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,020
I hope you post it on Twitter later.

140
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:20,860
I'm

141
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,890
not lagging anymore.

142
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,890
I wonder what happened.

143
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,230
I fixed it.

144
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,590
Wait, what if I click on the game?

145
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,090
Oh, I start lagging again!

146
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,870
Robbie, I thank you!

147
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,610
My super chats aren't working.

148
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,750
Wait, why is the game lagging for me whenever I click on it?

149
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,010
Hold on, I'm gonna close the game.

150
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:56,890
reopening it.

151
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,570
A Swiss would rather you take time for yourself than know you're struggling just for us.

152
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:06,850
Well, I have like so much anxiety about it because YouTube is not kind.

153
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,750
I'm like, I'm always like, people, everybody will forget about me.

154
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,830
So it's really hard for me to like take a break.

155
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,830
No, no, no, no, no, no.

156
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:25,160
Hi!

157
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,800
Huh?

158
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,900
Wait.

159
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,040
When's the last time I played this?

160
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,580
I updated my graphics card.

161
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,680
The la- I think- I updated my graphics card before the last time I played this- oh no.

162
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,340
Wait.

163
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,380
Huh?

164
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,600
What do I do?

165
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,060
Uh oh.

166
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,660
Uh oh.

167
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,520
It's okay now because I clicked out of the game.

168
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,420
You'll know when I click into the game.

169
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,200
What do I do?

170
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,200
I mean, I have to switch to...

171
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,980
But the graphics are already down.

172
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,480
They're the same...

173
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,100
They're the same that I had before.

174
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,160
I guess I could turn them down even more, but like...

175
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:31,750
This sucks!

176
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,250
I shouldn't have to do this!

177
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:43,740
Balanced?

178
00:20:52,280 --> 00:21:20,960
yeah the resolution is okay honestly if I make it any smaller I won't be able to see the game I've never I didn't have to turn off wallpaper engine before it still didn't work I think updating my graphics card messed everything up this is this is so stinky no way no way

179
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,700
Okay, hold on.

180
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,020
I'm gonna load the game and see if that...

181
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,160
Oh my gosh, it looks so...

182
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,640
It doesn't look bad, but it just looks great.

183
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,180
Wait!

184
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,760
Oh!

185
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,800
Oh my gosh, wait, that did fix it though.

186
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,520
That did fix it.

187
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:46,660
Why?

188
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,540
Why?

189
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,100
I updated my graphics card!

190
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,620
Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you guys.

191
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,960
I updated my graphics card to try for the VR stream.

192
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,160
And, um, the time...

193
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,600
I hadn't updated my graphics card.

194
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,940
card in over a year.

195
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,820
Until like last week.

196
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,550
It was working fine.

197
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,750
I didn't need to.

198
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,410
I didn't need to.

199
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,750
Yeah, if it isn't broke.

200
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:29,730
And clearly, clearly, I made the right decision because I just had to turn down everything to get myself to work.

201
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,170
What the heck?

202
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:32,930
Uh.

203
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:39,750
It honestly isn't that unusual because so many updates just break everything.

204
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,230
Hmm.

205
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:46,750
This is the worst.

206
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,370
I'm so mad right now.

207
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,310
But we, we, a baby's gotta do what a baby's gotta do.

208
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,130
I also updated mine like a week ago and I regret it.

209
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,150
I think I'll roll back.

210
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,650
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

211
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,640
That spooked me.

212
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:39,800
okay let's see what were we doing go through the oh yes we're going home how could i forget we're going home we got the drip i really miss my yeti arm though i think i got everything over here it's even like stuttering a little bit this is crazy crazy work right now Eko really is a ghost then.

213
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,680
Sweet home, Ebisugaoka.

214
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,840
Yes, it's this way.

215
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,020
I see this little black spot right there.

216
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,280
I imagine we probably...

217
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Wait, we probably have to go that way.

218
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,880
And go around.

219
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,000
Because this looks like it leads to nothing.

220
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,300
The staircase in the middle?

221
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,480
I'll try lowering the resolution.

222
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,000
But you guys, I won't be able to see.

223
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,380
Oh, oh, oopsie.

224
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,400
I didn't mean to do that.

225
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Wait, sorry.

226
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,290
What?

227
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,890
Oh, wait, how is that?

228
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,250
Big.

229
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:27,610
Big.

230
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,530
Follow the bouncing bunny tail.

231
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,020
Okay, why did it make the window bigger?

232
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,900
I don't want to go that small.

233
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,840
here so I can see.

234
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,440
That looks a bit better.

235
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,980
Oh, that's better.

236
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,520
That's better.

237
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,620
Oh, Kali!

238
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,940
Oh, no, it's a titty monster.

239
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,240
Oh!

240
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,120
Sorry, hold on.

241
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,400
I'm trying to fix everything now.

242
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh my gosh.

243
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,920
That, uh, changed my...

244
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,960
Okay.

245
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:15,660
Um...

246
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,620
Shoot.

247
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:17,960
Okay.

248
00:25:19,260 --> 00:26:15,460

249
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,760
I do think about leaving everything behind and moving into the woods sometimes.

250
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,080
But if I ever did, I could have probably Yoshi you.

251
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,380
It's because, for me, I'm really...

252
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,000
This is, like, I chose the worst thing ever.

253
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,120
I'm just really not good with...

254
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,780
With all, like, the attention sometimes.

255
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,560
Okay, I'm just gonna run.

256
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,180
I'm gonna run for it.

257
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,180
Bye!

258
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,900
Wait, is this the...

259
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,820
Is this the wrong way?

260
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,280
Oh, gosh.

261
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,320
Oh, my God.

262
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

263
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:50,960
Oh, wait.

264
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,500
Where am I?

265
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,400
Oh, gosh.

266
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:52,920
Wait.

267
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,220
Where am I supposed to go?

268
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,520
Ah!

269
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,860
Oh, God.

270
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,170
Wait.

271
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,550
No, please.

272
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,190
Wait.

273
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:03,150
Is this a...

274
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,150
Is this a...

275
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:11,800
Ah, jeez!

276
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:14,900
Okay.

277
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,280
Um...

278
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,600
Alright.

279
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:17,760
Uh...

280
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,840
Please do not...

281
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,300
Where do I go?

282
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,500
This is a boss fight of sorts, yes.

283
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,340
Okay, so I have to...

284
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,540
to.

285
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:29,760
Okay.

286
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,160
Yeah, I don't think it'll...

287
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,580
Oh, I see.

288
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,360
It won't clear up until I do kill it.

289
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,620
That's messed up.

290
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,320
Come here.

291
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,260
Oh!

292
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,480
Yeah, come here!

293
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,360
Don't go that way.

294
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,660
Then I confess.

295
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,500
Oh!

296
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,780
I dodged but not fast enough, I guess.

297
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,300
My bad.

298
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,100
I like how the mannequin is just, like, chilling over there.

299
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,140
Wait, did that get me?

300
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,060
Don't blame.

301
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,120
Come here!

302
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:07,540
Wait.

303
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,820
Oh, so nasty.

304
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,920
Slorpin'.

305
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,900
Slorpin.

306
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,760
Oh, my thing is about to break, so...

307
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,500
Let's actually...

308
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,980
Go to the axe, maybe.

309
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,940
Stop it.

310
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,560
Stop going...

311
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,300
Oh, she...

312
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,200
It's pushing the mannequin.

313
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Why are you leaving?

314
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,640
Where are you going?

315
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,560
Where are you going?

316
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,980
It's just fading out.

317
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,380
Where are you going?

318
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,090
Can you come here or something?

319
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,350
I don't want you attacking me.

320
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,460
Two in one!

321
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,100
Two in one!

322
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:04,940
Two in one!

323
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,020
Two in one!

324
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,460
Two in...

325
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,340
Oh, I have no.

326
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,400
Are you broken?

327
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
What's wrong?

328
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,240
Ah, nice.

329
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,780
Nice, nice, nice.

330
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:18,940
Maybe...

331
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,860
Actually, I think that hit me.

332
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,240
Oh, we got her.

333
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,360
Okay, yay.

334
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,400
So lame.

335
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,040
Forcing me to fight that thing.

336
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,060
So lame.

337
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,600
Hold on.

338
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,280

Oh yeah.

342
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:14,980
Oh yeah.

343
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,580
That's a good drink.

344
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,020
Nothing.

345
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,200
Stingy.

346
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,400
Stingy game.

347
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,200
Does the game...

348
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,840
Oh, return to Shimi's in residence.

349
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,880
Does the game look bad?

350
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,320
Does it still look okay that I lowered the quality on it?

351
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,060
What is this?

352
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,240
Oh, potatoes.

353
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:35,940
Potatoes.

354
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,040
Potatoes and molasses.

355
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Looks okay?

356
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,120
Okay, go ahead.

357
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm gonna turn back my...

358
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,240
Roll back my graphics card update.

359
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,760
I will not be held back.

360
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,540
You cannot...

361
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,720
You cannot hold this back.

362
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,160
Mama?

363
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,780
Lembo.

364
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,060
More soon.

365
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,260
More soon?

366
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,640
Really?

367
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,580
Good morning.

368
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:17,940
Good morning, everyone.

369
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,780
Today was my birthday!

370
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,700
Somebody, wait, your birthday is on Halloween?

371
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,800
That's so awesome.

372
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,930
Happy birthday!

373
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,260
Wait.

374
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,340
I'm hearing sounds from all over.

375
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,320
Spooky.

376
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,940
Well, this seems to be a dead end, but...

377
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,520
Oh my gosh.

378
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,660
I got it.

379
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,840
Wait, what's my health at?

380
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,860
Oh, we're okay.

381
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
What does that sound?

382
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,160
What is going...

383
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,880
What's purring?

384
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,910
What's purring?

385
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,610
Here, kitty.

386
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,910
Are you in the house?

387
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,210
I can't...

388
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,870
No, he's gotta be behind the house.

389
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,590
Here, kitty.

390
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,270
Kitty.

391
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,150
The...

392
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,790
It sounds so close.

393
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,750
Is it right behind the door?

394
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,330
Anyway.

395
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:30,810
Oh!

396
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,370
Oh my gosh.

397
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,270
No!

398
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,210
There's a party!

399
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,690
It's somewhere.

400
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,070
Yeah.

401
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,470
Definitely somewhere.

402
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,690
We're just like, walk.

403
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,810
Wait, so...

404
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,850
Oh, if we go this way, it probably...

405
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,870
It wouldn't make us go that way.

406
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,910
We have to go this way.

407
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,530
Away from the way the mannequins went.

408
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:07,090
This is not my house.

409
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:08,430
Up here.

410
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,550
We're going home.

411
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,930
I don't like that.

412
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,590
Oh, I really don't like that.

413
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,010
Oh, oh, okay.

414
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,850
I'm ready.

415
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,350
Ah!

416
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,110
Ah!

417
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,360
I wasn't ready.

418
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:29,980
Ouch.

419
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,800
Oh, sheesh.

420
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,820
Oh my gosh, I can't.

421
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,280
I can't.

422
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:44,830
Oh.

423
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,030
Come on.

424
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,370
Oh, whoops.

425
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,650
Ouch, ow, ow, ow, ow.

426
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,390
Wow!

427
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,090
Yeah, these guys suck.

428
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:56,730
These guys suck.

429
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,330
Because they'll get you in, like, a chain.

430
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:04,770
Like, uh...

431
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,810
Oh, I got him, though.

432
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,650
Yippee!

433
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:12,870
Ah, is this a full heal?

434
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,510
What the?

435
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,690
Wait, my weapon's gonna break soon!

436
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:18,590
Oh, no!

437
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:19,730
Wait, where is...

438
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,130
Why...

439
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,390
Why is everything going so wrong?

440
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,050
Eat.

441
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,770
Tool... that looks like a bandage.

442
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,310
I could use a toolbox, like, pronto.

443
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,850
Like, game?

444
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:42,550
Game, please be kind.

445
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,060
Game.

446
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,380
Game, won't you love me?

447
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,520
Why is the world so cruel?

448
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,740
The tree branch scared me, the leaves.

449
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,160
We're searching.

450
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,960
I got scared by the fog.

451
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,700
Imagine getting scared by fog in Silent Hill.

452
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,320
Okay.

453
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:44,340

454
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:49,130
Goodbye.

455
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:50,770
Leave.

456
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:54,610
You!

457
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,050
Sandava beach.

458
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,350
Wait, where's my house?

459
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:00,810
Here?

460
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,110
What do you expect?

461
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:16,110
I guess it would be kind of like crazy to go back home and see it all covered up.

462
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:20,290
It's always the barf.

463
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,110
He's got me sick.

464
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,260
Sick for you, baby.

465
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:31,850
Anything around?

466
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,690
No monsters hiding in the back of my house, right?

467
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,190
Surely?

468
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,310
But also no items either?

469
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:44,470
Hinako, what were you doing?

470
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,170
Why weren't you just replacing random?

471
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:48,950
some pills around your house before you left.

472
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,290
Shirley.

473
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:51,650
Don't call me Shirley.

474
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,750
In we go.

475
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:57,470
Aibo?

476
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:58,650
Onei-chan?

477
00:36:59,470 --> 00:36:59,870
Dereka?

478
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,690
Oh, oh there we go.

479
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,790
Anybody home?

480
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,330
Ojeamasimasu.

481
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:10,890
Ooh, stanky.

482
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:11,610
Oh,

483
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,600
safe point.

484
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,420
Moshi mochi.

485
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,220
They're redecorated, remodeled.

486
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,620
It's like the TARDIS.

487
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:41,740
Oh.

488
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,060
A normal phone call.

489
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,360
Okay.

490
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,220
Okay.

491
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:30,850

493
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,550
Can't do it.

494
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:42,030
What about in here?

495
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,810
I hear something in here though.

496
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:44,670
Oh, okay.

497
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:45,850
Just kidding.

498
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:46,590
We're safe.

499
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:47,450
What about this one?

500
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:48,590
Okay.

501
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,830
It's no good.

502
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,730
Can't do it.

503
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,870
I'm like hearing some sort of cracking.

504
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,210
Freaky.

505
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,430
Oh, that looks like a weapon.

506
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:05,650
What does this say?

507
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,330
The sword and the fox fought, battling upon a set of scales.

508
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,230
The heavens themselves shuddered at the ferocity of their struggle.

509
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:21,370
Day by day, oh, day after day, the sun rose behind the fox's back and set behind the swords.

510
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,170
Yet their fight knew no end.

511
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:30,190
The scales upon which they fought, however, were no more having been destroyed long ago.

512
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,670
so puzzle

513
00:39:35,840 --> 00:40:02,120

There was a...

515
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,650
What was it?

516
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:11,630
There was a hole here?

517
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:13,030
It's gone now?

518
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,080
Spooky, spooky.

519
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,780
I don't want anything jumping out at me.

520
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,170
Oh, the pictures...

521
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,830

This is huge.

523
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,110
Friendly elephant.

Thank you so much for the gift.

525
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:59,730
Thank you so much for the gift.

526
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:04,130
Thank you for the gift.

527
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:05,210
Thank you for the capsules.

528
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:07,750
Can I have a toolbox, please?

529
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,130
May I have a toolbox?

530
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,170
Shoe is sick.

00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:45,950
okay so we're finding that too got it

534
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:56,110
I hope this part is more puzzle-focused and less fighting.

535
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,190
Hung.

536
00:41:59,790 --> 00:41:59,910
Wait.

537
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,650
Whoa.

538
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,150
Whoa.

539
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:07,570
Wait, this is so long.

540
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,730
Okay, before we go in there, I do want to kind of...

541
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:11,950
What were you looking at?

542
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,410
Oh, nothing.

543
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:13,750
Okay.

544
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:20,810
I missed that in, like, horror games when the protagonist, when they saw something, they were, like, very blatantly, like...

545
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:23,090
Stare at it, you know?

546
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,220
Bapap!

547
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,280
Biplele!

548
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,060
Biplep-bap-bap-a-bop-bap-a-bop!

549
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,300
No!

550
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,420
Okay, we gotta go offer some stuff.

551
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,740
Nerd hours.

552
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,520
Let's go offer some Higashi.

553
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,480
Higashi.

554
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:52,960
Uh, offer.

555
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:54,700
The Higashi.

556
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,360
Get some faith, baby.

557
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,380
Oh, I have so many bandages.

558
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,360
I just noticed.

559
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:05,980
Okay.

560
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:07,320
All right.

561
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,380
And then we'll go get that.

562
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:11,290
And then we'll offer that as well.

563
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,020
There's nothing in here, is there?

564
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,860
Nothing gonna pop out.

565
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,040
Right?

566
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,590
Here we go and offer.

567
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,570
Codenya, thank you so much for the gift.

568
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,370
Thank you.

569
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:33,890
car cash.

570
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:37,390
I'm just gonna save again so I don't have to do all this again.

571
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:41,210
Oh!

572
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,550
Shirley, it's safe.

573
00:43:44,250 --> 00:43:46,730
Um, I don't think I asked Shirley's opinion.

574
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,060
Okay.

575
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,380
I'm just making sure what.

576
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,040
It's no good.

577
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,200
Oh my gosh.

578
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,800
It's just endless, endless, endless doors.

579
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:06,180
Nothing?

580
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,340
Oh, that spooked me.

581
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,040
Why give me the option, then?

582
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,520
Like, it's actually rude.

583
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,970
I'm scared to try this door.

584
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:27,800
Okay.

585
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,820
There's a lot of bottles.

586
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,060
Hey, Minto.

587
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:33,720
Hi.

588
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,740
Certificate of full payment.

589
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,860
Toshimizu Kanta.

590
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,740
Certificate of full payment.

591
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:48,140
This certificate has been sent to certify that Shimizu Kanta has paid all outstanding loans and is thereby released from any further contractual obligations.

592
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,260
We thank you for your continued patronage.

593
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:52,420
Okay.

594
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,040
Good job.

595
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,680
Good job.

596
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,180
Paying off your debt.

597
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:00,980
Good job.

598
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:02,860
A divine water.

599
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,260
Okay, we can go give that away too.

600
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,080
That's what the dad calls these bottles.

601
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,660
Divine water.

602
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,560
Oh, sorry.

603
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,480
I thought, like, blood appeared on the floor?

604
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,220
I was wrong.

605
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,940
I will go in this door.

606
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,020
Don't worry.

607
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,540
I'm just...

608
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:28,280
You know...

609
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:34,400
Biddling!

610
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,080
Yeah, fancy way of saying wine.

611
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,200
That's what Matara calls water.

612
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,320
I mean, wine.

613
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,400
Divine water.

614
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,200
Matara calm.

615
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:49,130
Oh, my gosh.

616
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:49,590
Maybe...

617
00:45:49,610 --> 00:46:15,850
this loops hopefully from like this hallway that's the hope at least the wine water nah too on the nose whoa is that her that's like a portrait of her wait okay hold on is this oh my gosh okay all

618
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:22,970
right i'm going around a little bit what's in here it's stuck

619
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,920
So many rooms!

620
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,280
I'm not going into them because I'm...

621
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,360
Oh!

622
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:33,500
Ah!

623
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:36,180
Well...

624
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,700
I guess, yeah, we can switch it out.

625
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,980
I'm scared of the rooms.

626
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:45,540
Because, you know.

627
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,860
I feel like something will happen in there.

628
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,380
Something always happens in a room.

629
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,140
It's not my fault I'm paranoid.

630
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,120
It's because I've learned.

631
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,670
You want to know how I got these scars.

632
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:07,850
From learning.

633
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,990
Thank you, thank you.

634
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,450
I mean, though, thank you for today.

635
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,830
Even if I couldn't make it, that was a treat.

636
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:19,010
Thank you!

637
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,590
Oh, oh, oh, see?

638
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,370
Oh, okay.

639
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:28,110
This is a loop.

640
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:28,570
though, right?

641
00:47:28,810 --> 00:47:29,690
Okay, yes, it is.

642
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:30,030
Okay.

643
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:35,510
This also...

644
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:36,470
Oh, okay.

645
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:39,690
Aha, it all connects.

646
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:40,390
Okay, cool.

647
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:41,970
We'll just go this way then.

648
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,350
I picked up a note from Hinako.

649
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:48,990
I'm still alive, but tomorrow I'll make sure you draw your final breath.

650
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:51,850
I don't care if it's your special day.

651
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:55,970
From me?

652
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,210
Who am I telling that to?

653
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:03,550
Such a gangster.

654
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:07,310
I'll make sure you draw your final breath.

655
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:08,490
Oh, Romani.

656
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:10,210
I could sell that.

657
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:19,290
Aha!

658
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:20,330
Okay, good.

659
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,090
I wanted to go sell some of this stuff.

660
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,920
Holy moly.

661
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:29,640
Um.

662
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:31,900
Is that the only thing I got?

663
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,100
Oh.

664
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,280
I almost want to do some gotcha.

665
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,140
I have no...

666
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,920
It's hard when I have no...

667
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:40,780
What's it called?

668
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,300
No enna.

669
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,420
To...

670
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,720
Buy upgrades.

671
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,740
As a treat.

672
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,900
Like look!

673
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,280
I'm almost enough to 3,000.

674
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,820
I am at 2,250.

675
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,180
If we just had an Emma, we would be able to...

676
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:10,840
Emma?

677
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,020
Who's Emma?

678
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,940
Yeah, I won't draw any...

679
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:24,120
I won't do a gotcha so that maybe we can increase the Emma slot, or the Omamori slot.

680
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:27,000
Or stamp... I don't know.

681
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,660
I'll figure out something.

682
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,300
I'll decide.

683
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,300
What's wrong with Eee?

684
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,180
Really, what is wrong with that girl?

685
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,740
What's in here?

686
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,600
Any trinkets?

687
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:45,220
I love trinkets.

688
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,460
Okay, I'm still looking for like three of those things.

689
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,000
What are they?

690
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:55,840
The three crests.

691
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,620
Halfway to two years!

692
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,940
Thank you!

693
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:01,140
Oh my gosh!

694
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,660
Thank you so much.

695
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,100
Oh!

696
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:08,500
My dream.

697
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:10,340
Ominous photo.

698
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,160
I don't know why, but it appears each photograph can be rotated.

699
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:17,820
There might be some kind of connection to the writing and the group photo.

700
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:22,360
My room.

701
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:25,580
The sword and fox...

702
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:26,800
Oh yeah, here we go.

703
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,970
Writing on the... here?

704
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:33,150
Oh no, this is not a group.

705
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:34,490
Oh, this one.

706
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:37,370
What is that?

707
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,210
Something was hanging here before.

708
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:41,730
Alrighty.

709
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:44,930
They're crossed out.

710
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:46,070
It's you, girl.

711
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,670
You're crossed out.

712
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,490
I don't know why.

713
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:53,150
Oh, wait.

714
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,550
Besides the group photo, there is a collection of other photographs.

715
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:56,950
One seems to be missing, however.

716
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:02,650
A rather unsettling group photo that hangs in the living room.

717
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:04,630
It seems someone has taken a marker to it.

718
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:14,900
Okay.

719
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:15,980
Maybe I...

720
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,860
Maybe only she's upside down because she's crossed out.

721
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:25,840
Check out.

722
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,540
Well, there's other places we need to go.

723
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,000
Actually, wait, we're missing a photo.

724
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,100
So, maybe let's go check this room finally.

725
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:39,120
And also, the bloody axe room.

726
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,480
Okay.

727
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,140
We're running, we're running.

728
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,380
We're running, we're running.

729
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,060
I feel like this area is really gonna make me...

730
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,220
Put my guard down!

731
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:56,560
Oh my god!

732
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:13,910
Gosh,

733
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:18,010
dang it.

734
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,660
Where is she?

735
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,960
I hate.

736
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,680
Yeah, what is going on with your house, huh?

737
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:33,880
Girl, I have many questions.

738
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,680
Oh my gosh, my shadow scared me.

739
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,240
I shouldn't have gotten into this.

740
00:52:41,260 --> 00:53:13,810
room I made a grave error and I made a lapse in judgment I I screwed up simply I messed up that's not a door I need to catch up and watch part four should I wait to watch the stream Brian as much as I would love you to stick around I think you should I think you should wait to watch I would I'd love to have you here,

741
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:15,990
but I understand.

742
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:17,650
Where is she?

743
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,670
Oh, the music is so loud.

744
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,950
Oh, there she is.

745
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:24,290
Ouch!

746
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:26,150
Oh my god.

747
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,710
Did I get

748
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:38,710
her?

749
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:39,730
Oh, yeah, I did.

750
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:40,330
Nice.

751
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:42,450
Okay.

752
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:43,730
Brian, thank you so much for the vibe.

753
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:44,690
Good to thank you!

754
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:48,810
Okay, we found her.

755
00:53:49,470 --> 00:54:04,030
and there's another one oh there's this stinker oh nasty i don't want to deal with you you're gross oh my

756
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:30,840
knife yeah okay if there's nothing in here i'm gonna scream oh sickle oh i think we could maybe Place the knife with the sickle.

757
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:31,880
Wait.

758
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,360
No, I'm thinking of...

759
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,040
What was the thing that I had with the scarecrows?

760
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:36,960
It wasn't the sickle.

761
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,660
There's a crowbar?

762
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,180
Wait, there's there?

763
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,660
Did I miss it?

764
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,960
I can grab the sickle, though.

765
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,420
Oh.

766
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,340
I will come back for it.

767
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,720
Like if my knife breaks, you know.

768
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,900
Or win my knife.

769
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,380
I don't want it to break, though.

770
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,160
I want to find a toolbox before then, you know?

771
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:02,320
Dang it!

772
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,220
Let's use a bandage.

773
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:14,710
Lots of weapons.

774
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:16,110
We only found one.

775
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,330
Oh, no, you're right.

776
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:18,350
There was more than one.

777
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,630
Yeah, in this puzzle heavy area.

778
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,870
Hey, you're so right.

779
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:25,630
What's up with that?

780
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:28,930
And no Emma!

781
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:32,210
Stingy game.

782
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,950
That area looks so dark and so scary.

783
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:43,800
Oh!

784
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,140
Oh!

785
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:46,480
Art room.

786
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,480
Oh, cute!

787
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,100
So cute.

788
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,560
Letter from a man.

789
00:55:55,860 --> 00:56:00,060
I do not believe there is any reason you should be tied down by your younger self.

790
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:05,420
Likewise, there is no reason your future self should be constrained by the you you are today.

791
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:08,080
Thank you, by the way, for the beautiful pressed flower.

792
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:11,360
It was the first gift I had received from you, and I will surely cherish it.

793
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,660
it until the end of time.

794
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:15,300
Huh?

795
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,120
Do you eat me this car?

796
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,860
What does that mean?

797
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:27,290
The Foxman?

798
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,390
Oh, I hear something.

799
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:39,410
I can't tell if it's like, oh my gosh, it's so scary.

800
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,730
I can't tell if it's like in here.

801
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,690
Okay, it's gotta be down here then.

802
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:45,390
Oh, I hear him.

803
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:46,010
You hear him?

804
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:49,970
I don't want my weapon to break.

805
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:50,570
You know what?

806
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:51,610
Maybe I'll use this.

807
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:52,590
No.

808
00:56:54,990 --> 00:56:56,650
We'll use the axe, I guess.

809
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,250
Oh, light turned on.

810
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:04,650
It's stuck.

811
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:06,330
Oh!

812
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:10,370
Ah!

813
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:15,210
Ah, dang it!

814
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:15,710
Ah, geez.

815
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:17,810
It's okay.

816
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:18,550
Oh.

817
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:21,710
Oh, I hate this weapon.

818
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:28,850
Ow, geez.

819
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:31,010
Not doing so hot.

820
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:33,890
You stuck, too?

821
00:57:34,110 --> 00:57:34,670
We're both stuck?

822
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,750
We're both stuck?

823
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:40,390
Ow.

824
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:42,650
My sanity.

825
00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,810
Is this gonna blow up, or are you gonna turn into a thing?

826
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,710
What are we gonna do here?

827
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,550
Ow!

828
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:56,170
Oh, leave me alone.

829
00:57:56,570 --> 00:58:01,630
Oh my

830
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,520
gosh!

831
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,280
There's purple they spawned something.

832
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,060
Oh, okay.

833
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,800
Somehow I dodge that.

834
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,480
Please!

835
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,080
Please!

836
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:34,540
Ouch!

837
00:58:40,910 --> 00:58:40,910
I

838
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,380
think I needed to use it.

839
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,020
Oh dang, this thing's about to die.

840
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,160
Oh come on!

841
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,700
At least the spit hit the wall too.

842
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,480
But that was evil.

843
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:15,720
Oh, maybe?

844
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,000
Yippee!

845
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:26,680
Goodbye, Tinny Monster.

846
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:30,520
I wish I...

847
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:31,960
Never heard to say that.

848
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:32,980
I got some chocolate.

849
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,220
Huzzah!

850
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,520
Huzzah indeed!

851
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:41,060
Huzzah!

852
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,440
Wait, is this room again?

853
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,400
Nandato?

854
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:47,360
Some kudzu.

855
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:50,720
Um...

856
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,600
Well... I don't really need...

857
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:53,740
We don't need the kutsu.

858
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,280
I can always come back to it, too.

859
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:03,500
My axe is about to break.

860
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,000
All my weapons are about to break.

861
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,600
Look at it.

862
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,940
It has like one...

863
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:09,200
Wait.

864
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,640
It has like one hit on it.

865
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,560
That's crazy.

866
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,860
All my things are about to break for real, though.

867
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,140
It's pretty bad.

868
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:55,880
There was that room we could I could go into it could I over here is nothing wait unless no oh gosh scared me imagine the cleanup if one of these got into your house I know okay I'm gonna go get the sickle the sickle I think I hear something and the music gets crazy.

869
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,240
I think there's something afoot.

870
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,620
Okay, goodbye kitchen knife.

871
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,300
I hardly knew ye.

872
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,560
Okay.

873
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:07,880
Oh, wait.

874
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,120
I can open this door.

875
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:14,060
Against my better judgment.

876
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:16,100
Oh.

877
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,000
It's a hallway.

878
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:29,740
Okay.

879
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:33,020
What is this?

880
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,420
And Emma!

881
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:35,960
Oh my gosh!

882
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:37,300
We got one!

883
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,960
I think that's the lamp that's making the noises, but I don't like it.

884
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,260
Okay.

885
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,680
Let's go, baby.

886
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,520
Actually, let's go save baby.

887
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:53,560
Yeah.

888
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,620
Let's save baby.

889
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:00,480
Okay.

890
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,800
And then I...

891
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,820
I will save maybe for the another Omamori slot.

892
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:14,620
Baby.

893
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:17,980
Ouch, hold on.

894
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,960
Let me put in an eyedrop, please.

895
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,280
Baby, baby.

896
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:36,830
No health?

897
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:38,670
Well...

898
01:02:38,670 --> 01:03:08,130
I feel like I've increased my health already before I don't know why my one eye is like so dry okay um so that leads into another hallway oh my gosh this place I haven't even got it you know what let's go over here let's just get it out of the way it's spooky scary I don't like it it's really dark and I know there's a monster here because the music goes crazy

899
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,110
What's here?

900
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,770
What's here?

901
01:03:15,390 --> 01:03:15,450
Oh!

902
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:18,890
What is it?

903
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:26,100
I think I hate these guys.

904
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,880
Yes, I hate this guy.

905
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:33,820
Oh, no talk!

906
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:41,850
Can I sneak up on him?

907
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:48,840
Oh!

908
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:49,960
Yeah!

909
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,870
That was so clean.

910
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:00,610
Wowie.

911
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:03,690
Good job, Watashi!

912
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:07,410
Alright.

913
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:10,390
All those doors are no good.

914
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,610
This looks like an exit.

915
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:15,490
This looks like it goes outside.

916
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:21,550
Let's go get rid of the...

917
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,470
Wait, what's the chocolate?

918
01:04:22,750 --> 01:04:23,450
Max sanity?

919
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:26,630
Eat the chocolate.

920
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:31,610
Let's eat it.

921
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,090
Eat the chocolate.

922
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:43,880
Delicious.

923
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,900
Does this go outside?

924
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:49,560
No.

925
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:52,000
Oh, why would it do that?

926
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,560
Of course not.

927
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:00,560
Wait, what?

928
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:13,590
Does someone come excuse me this is my home oh picture of me i can't remember when this was taken though

929
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:40,120
i do look at it oh scoob we gotta get rid of something no kids came by yesterday so now all this chocolate is mine let's go you don't need that many first Yeah, but I'm not going to throw one away.

930
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,980
The Yokan, I think it would be the best bet.

931
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:49,500
Or the Higashi.

932
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:51,640
Let's go with Higashi.

933
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,020
I never use it.

934
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,320
There's two of them, but that's okay.

935
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,700
I don't know what to...

936
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:10,800
But, uh...

937
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,180
Oh, more capsules.

938
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:17,450
Um...

939
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:24,090
I've heard that a lot recently though that people got a ton of...

940
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:39,790
Holy, okay.

941
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,830
So I could not see at all what I was doing.

942
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:48,330
I was just... I was just swinging it.

943
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,530
I could not tell at all what was happening.

944
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,630
I just did it.

945
01:06:57,830 --> 01:06:59,510
Well, we got the painting we needed.

946
01:07:00,330 --> 01:07:01,730
Or the picture, whatever it was.

947
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:04,090
Okay.

948
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:07,170
Enshrine.

949
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:08,450
You.

950
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:12,530
We just need...

951
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,230
Wait.

952
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:14,910
I could offer Adade.

953
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,570
Actually, let's offer, like, all of them.

954
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,350
Just ten more!

955
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:27,750
Oh, hold on for now, though.

956
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:29,650
I want to save.

957
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:34,910
Okay.

958
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:38,950
But what Omamori should I equip?

959
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:39,570
I wonder.

960
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,850
I'm in Osaka, and yesterday I found an idol festival in the park near the castle!

961
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,570
I watched some of the performances, and they were awesome.

962
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:46,510
The audience is great, too.

963
01:07:46,630 --> 01:07:47,670
Complete with live sticks and otage.

964
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:48,670
It was really cool.

965
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:49,970
Let's go!

966
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:51,390
Sounds fun.

967
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,630
Oh, I guess I just forgot to...

968
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:57,850
Wait, it says I can enter there, though.

969
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:00,610
Hmm.

970
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:01,090
Mysterious.

971
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:04,910
Curious.

972
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:05,770
Wait a second.

973
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:08,070
The picture room.

974
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:08,490
Oh, wait.

975
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:12,150
It was in the other place.

976
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:15,290
Oh.

977
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:16,210
Okay.

978
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:17,550
Awesome.

979
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:23,700
Uh...

980
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:55,920

981
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:56,860
there are two Hinako.

982
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:58,660
It doesn't feel right.

983
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,520
It's like someone's watching me.

984
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,110
Red capsules.

985
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:10,080
Take it.

986
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:13,260
Okay.

987
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:15,600
Gramp.

988
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,060
Okay.

989
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,140
Oh, heavy.

990
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,160
Heavy.

991
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,120
What the?

992
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,640
Oh, okay.

993
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:38,250
I knew it.

994
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,290
I knew something like this was going to happen.

995
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:44,870
Oh, how did I still get hit?

996
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:45,650
This sucks.

997
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:46,330
Ouch, ouch.

998
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:53,200
Ouches.

999
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:54,260
It's hard to see here.

1000
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,900
Sick dodge, thank you.

1001
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:04,940
Until I didn't.

1002
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:09,020
Oh, until I didn't.

1003
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:10,600
Puzzle god.

1004
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:11,640
Yeah, I might be.

1005
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:32,920
okay so we've done all of this area perhaps um so it's just these couple of doors i don't think i can go back i will try though because we have the first crest yay that was her room

1006
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:45,140
first crest done wait oh it should be one out of three that's okay That's fine.

1007
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,620
You can be wrong, Gim.

1008
01:10:48,220 --> 01:10:48,920
Okay, yeah.

1009
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:50,920
I forgot to grab it!

1010
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,280
Oh!

1011
01:11:10,430 --> 01:11:14,350
A wooden block with a slanted scale painted on one side.

1012
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:15,850
I wonder what it's for.

1013
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:20,250
Oh, the game saved for me.

1014
01:11:20,910 --> 01:11:21,310
Let's go.

1015
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:24,060
Wait.

1016
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,580
I could not go in here.

1017
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,580
It's because I got caught.

1018
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,140
by the mannequin.

1019
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,000
Okay, let's resave because I was silly.

1020
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,200
And one.

1021
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:43,400
And we go in wait.

1022
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:48,800
In through here.

1023
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:51,760
And around.

1024
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,640
And around.

1025
01:11:56,260 --> 01:12:00,160
Forget it, be- So sorry.

1026
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,630
Please excuse my dear aunt Sally.

1027
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:09,040
Oh my gosh.

1028
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:18,260
Oh gosh, she's just sitting there.

1029
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:21,000
Oh my gosh, she's just sitting there.

1030
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:31,980
He took a shadow.

1031
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:45,400
Yeah.

1032
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:49,860
Oh, yeah.

1033
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,200
Oh,

1034
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:57,120
don't.

1035
01:13:09,150 --> 01:13:11,410
He's got like little horns.

1036
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:21,930
Complicated, huh?

1037
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,130
Uh-oh.

1038
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,530
Who's around?

1039
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:26,770
What the monster?

1040
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:30,430
Yellowed calendar.

1041
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:32,490
Calendar placed in this room for some reason.

1042
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,830
I missed my last birthday yesterday!

1043
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,450
There's a happy birthday!

1044
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,850
I didn't want to miss another thank you for being such a cute ghost.

1045
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,230
Thank you so much!

1046
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:45,250
Happy happy birthday!

1047
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:46,910
I'm sorry I missed it too!

1048
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,210
Happy birthday!

1049
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:58,230
Did something like a spawn outside the door?

1050
01:13:59,570 --> 01:14:00,270
Most likely.

1051
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:02,030
Okay, hold on.

1052
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:20,550
so just the two rooms left this is this last one has definitely got to be something because it's like a big room um i didn't find literally anything in here and then there's the one wait is this

1053
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:32,500
what's running around oh my gosh

1054
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:37,900
oh i think it's a mannequin

1055
01:14:47,530 --> 01:14:54,350
Oh, come on.

1056
01:14:58,270 --> 01:14:58,850
Ouch!

1057
01:14:59,090 --> 01:14:59,710
Oh, shit.

1058
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:05,140
Eat my crackers.

1059
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:12,750
Okay, cool.

1060
01:15:14,770 --> 01:15:16,210
Well, I just lost my sickle.

1061
01:15:16,290 --> 01:15:16,830
That sucks.

1062
01:15:17,370 --> 01:15:19,190
I'm gonna use my toolbox on this then.

1063
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:23,670
I like the crowbar.

1064
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:26,090
It feels comfortable.

1065
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,730
Thank you, half-life.

1066
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:31,570
That feels good.

1067
01:15:32,490 --> 01:15:33,910
It feels natural.

1068
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:42,800
Okay.

1069
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:44,300
That's always cool.

1070
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,160
I'll pick it up.

1071
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,180
Oh, Hinako's diary.

1072
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:48,720
I hate my dad.

1073
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:50,700
I wish he would just die.

1074
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,120
I hate my mom, too.

1075
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,020
She deserves to die as well.

1076
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:57,920
It's such like a teen...

1077
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,280
I understand her situation, but it's...

1078
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:03,260
It sounds like such like a teenager's kind of diary, you know?

1079
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:09,140
If I could just turn into a monster, then I'd take the two of them and crush them to death with my bare hands.

1080
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:10,500
I hate this house, too.

1081
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:11,720
I hate everything.

1082
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:12,540
Everything.

1083
01:16:17,690 --> 01:16:19,350
Got some ramen in the closet, though.

1084
01:16:26,260 --> 01:16:26,700
Okay.

1085
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:29,760
There's nothing in this room.

1086
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:31,820
Cool.

1087
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:37,080
So what do I do now?

1088
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,230
Because...

1089
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:42,670
Sup.

1090
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:44,230
Sup.

1091
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:46,430
Sup.

1092
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,130
Um...

1093
01:16:50,130 --> 01:16:51,950
There's just this door.

1094
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:55,870
I got the crest.

1095
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:56,930
But that's...

1096
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,540
Yeah, Hinako has got like Buku bugs.

1097
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:05,680
Do I have this kind of house?

1098
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,100
Crazy money.

1099
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:10,480
Crazy.

1100
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:12,820
Oh, I got a calendar also.

1101
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:13,580
That's right.

1102
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,160
But...

1103
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,100
So I got the picture.

1104
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:18,760
I got the calendar.

1105
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,100
And I got the crest.

1106
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,420
But I think all of those are two puzzles.

1107
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,280
I don't remember an area to...

1108
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:31,260
I don't remember the area to...

1109
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:32,320
What's the word?

1110
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,560
Maybe there's a place to hang the calendar in here?

1111
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:38,200
No?

1112
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:48,030
Hmm.

1113
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:49,530
Hmm.

1114
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:55,670
The wall where she said there used to be a calendar.

1115
01:17:55,930 --> 01:17:56,710
Wait, is it right here?

1116
01:17:57,090 --> 01:17:57,810
Oh, it is!

1117
01:17:58,890 --> 01:17:59,230
Okay.

1118
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:02,690
Ah!

1119
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:05,050
Oh, I get it!

1120
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:07,810
Oh my gosh, it's like a weird loop.

1121
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:10,250
So...

1122
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:11,410
Oh.

1123
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:12,470
Whoa!

1124
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:13,550
Whoa.

1125
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,450
It's so brightly lit here.

1126
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,990
Oh!

1127
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,310
Okay.

1128
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:44,830
errand request Hinako I'm sorry but could you drop by Shu's house and buy that stomach medicine for me again also please let his family know that I've been getting better thanks to them traditional medicine truly is better than all those modern drugs and herbal remedies are far gentler on the body tell them that I'll pay my bill at the end of the month mom okay oh who's here

1129
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,540
oh the music

1130
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:09,860
Yeah, that's right.

1131
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1132
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,360
Ooh, she hits hard.

1133
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:19,420
Oh, my God.

1134
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:20,280
Oh, my God.

1135
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,800
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1136
01:19:26,670 --> 01:19:27,710
Okay, we're good.

1137
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:29,050
Holy cow.

1138
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:30,550
That was close, I think.

1139
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:32,730
That was pretty bad.

1140
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:34,810
Oof.

1141
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:41,700
Um...

1142
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:46,890
It smells horrible!

1143
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:47,970
What is this?

1144
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:48,610
Oh!

1145
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:55,290
It looks like it reminds me of the grudge so much.

1146
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,930
Wow!

1147
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:59,390
That's cool.

1148
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:01,330
Do you think this is gonna grab me?

1149
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:04,570
Guess not.

1150
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,290
This is what she'd be putting in the miso soup?

1151
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:12,570
That's sick.

1152
01:20:16,030 --> 01:20:16,910
Very cool.

1153
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:27,650
Okay, I was gonna say there should be a safe spot here.

1154
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:31,850
Good soup.

1155
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:37,720
Let's go down this way first.

1156
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,380
So many monsters.

1157
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,080
So many monsters.

1158
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,600
More monsters.

1159
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:49,540
No good.

1160
01:20:54,460 --> 01:20:55,040
In here.

1161
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:02,560
Because it's like... Oh my gosh.

1162
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:04,180
It's like...

1163
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,980
It's hard to explore a little, you know?

1164
01:21:08,600 --> 01:21:09,120
Oh!

1165
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:15,620
It's hard to explore.

1166
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:21,040
I feel like you have to kill them or else you really can't like explore so much.

1167
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,820
Oh my god, no way.

1168
01:21:33,140 --> 01:21:34,040
Oh my gosh!

1169
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:41,410
Stinking Chung is alive!

1170
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,620
No, no.

1171
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,100
My stamina?

1172
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:50,560
Ah!

1173
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:56,080
Ah!

1174
01:21:58,680 --> 01:21:59,120
Okay.

1175
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,080
Oh, gosh!

1176
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:15,820
I'm dumb.

1177
01:22:17,860 --> 01:22:18,980
Oh, we got him.

1178
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:19,560
Okay, good.

1179
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:23,200
He ran around so fast!

1180
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,680
I didn't know he left the hallway.

1181
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,600
That was crazy seeing him!

1182
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,160
He spotted me through the door and went around the other way.

1183
01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:36,240
What kind of enemy AI is this?

1184
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,140
I hate it.

1185
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,100
That was terrible.

1186
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:43,760
Oh my gosh.

1187
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:44,940
Another toolkit.

1188
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,580
Let's go.

1189
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:51,020
I'm gonna use it on you again.

1190
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:54,760
My precious crowbar, I love you.

1191
01:22:56,720 --> 01:23:00,300
Holy count the same as Minecraft.

1192
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:05,680
The Minecraft AI so elite, so smart.

1193
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:10,680
Okay, well we took out those two guys.

1194
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,380
Okay.

1195
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,280
Was there anything I could get rid of?

1196
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:20,940
I don't think there was anything that I got.

1197
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,240
Oh, the Raminé.

1198
01:23:24,740 --> 01:23:25,180
Wait!

1199
01:23:25,980 --> 01:23:26,260
Oh!

1200
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:37,400
Before I increase my Omamori, I want to see what Omamori I have.

1201
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:40,940
So currently I have Slightly Restores Health after Defeating An Enemy.

1202
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:44,240
Greatly Decreases Focus Charging Time.

1203
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,520
There was a...

1204
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:51,220
There was one that I had that I took off.

1205
01:23:56,290 --> 01:23:57,590
Increases Max Health.

1206
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:01,290
I could always do that, but then at that point, why wouldn't I just...

1207
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,130
I should...

1208
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:43,990
i would just do my health instead of instead max stamina we could always do that but then at the same time also see your eye okay yeah it's just a little dry today sometimes it happens like that slightly restores health after each successful counter decreases enemy line of sight perfect dodges become easier to perform greatly decreases the damage taken while dodging increases stun power when weapon durability is low deals additional damage when using weapons with high durability effective only for weapons with durability really decreases the amount of stamina consumed when sprinting in fights

1209
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:56,900
i think it's a percentile increased based on wait increase on your base health not flat number so it's always useful

1210
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,720
there's one where it lowers durability usage for light attack I don't know if you have it yet.

1211
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,900
It doesn't seem like it.

1212
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:08,400
I do dodge a lot.

1213
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:13,240
I don't know.

1214
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:18,060
I'm almost feeling because like the feel like the ones that would be most useful are the max stamina.

1215
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:20,500
But then I should just save my...

1216
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,080
I don't know.

1217
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,260
Horse is comfy for moving around.

1218
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:29,360
I guess that's true.

1219
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:49,000
I will I don't remember if I saved I will just save and we can think on it maybe we'll find some more things as well and we can like oh wait can I already go wait is it is it already looped

1220
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:59,760
whoa that's no good wait oh no I thought that was there was something there was one area that was like there's something supposed to be hanging here

1221
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:57,960
save and roll all the gotcha then reload fragrant letter there are many creatures that discard their shells as they mature i believe that the suffocating feeling you are experiencing is merely a sign of sign that you are growing up a hint that it is time to rid yourself of your shell oh my gosh we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna get rid of our skin you think it's a strange coincidence your name means baby bird i am sure all of this is simply pointing you and the fact that the time for you to spread your wings and fly is drawing near we're molting okay oh whoa uh yes is there something i should be interested in here Oh,

1222
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:58,540
okay.

1223
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:00,820
Okay.

1224
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,380
How about the thing that's leaking?

1225
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:05,900
No?

1226
01:27:07,340 --> 01:27:10,740
This just looks like a jump scare waiting to happen, no?

1227
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,120
Um...

1228
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,140
Do she have Yowie?

1229
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:15,880
She is...

1230
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,260
She is Miss Yowie.

1231
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:20,820
She actually is the owner of Yowie.

1232
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,700
She created Yowie.

1233
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:27,630
Okay.

1234
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,650
It wouldn't let me...

1235
01:27:30,590 --> 01:27:31,310
Am I dumb?

1236
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:31,910
Maybe?

1237
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:34,030
Is there like a...

1238
01:27:36,170 --> 01:27:38,590
Is there like a hint for this or something?

1239
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:40,790
John Yowie?

1240
01:27:42,370 --> 01:27:43,830
Next to the bottom box is...

1241
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:45,150
Ah!

1242
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:46,510
Oh!

1243
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:52,430
A block of wax.

1244
01:27:53,390 --> 01:27:58,370
A semi-transparent block of wax placed in my diary for some reason.

1245
01:27:59,790 --> 01:28:01,910
There seems to be something stuck inside.

1246
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,060
Yeah.

1247
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,700
I'm super drunk.

1248
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:13,760
Have fun, Rooks!

1249
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,780
Be safe!

1250
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:21,030
The music's starting up again.

1251
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:26,840
Okay.

1252
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,140
Sorry, I'm always safe scumming in this game.

1253
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:31,080
I, uh...

1254
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,760
Do not want to be in a position.

1255
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:41,740
Mostly, I do it because Because that's like, if I die, I really just don't want to redo what I've just done.

1256
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,080
You know what I mean?

1257
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:45,360
Alright, who's around?

1258
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:46,360
Who's here?

1259
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:48,400
Show yourself.

1260
01:28:58,280 --> 01:28:58,680
In here?

1261
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,660
Maybe?

1262
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:02,040
No?

1263
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,310
Around the corner?

1264
01:29:06,970 --> 01:29:07,170
No?

1265
01:29:09,030 --> 01:29:09,590
Wait.

1266
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,510
Oh, I think that's a steel bar.

1267
01:29:12,970 --> 01:29:13,410
Glam!

1268
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:36,170
give me crowbar or give me death actually don't give me that I want to finish the game oh I think they're behind that door perhaps we'll come back to it

1269
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:45,690
no death No death right now.

1270
01:29:48,070 --> 01:29:49,170
Oh, wait a second.

1271
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,380
I think I hear you.

1272
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:00,700
Yes, I do.

1273
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:02,140
Oh, there's two of you!

1274
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:04,720
Oh, nasty.

1275
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:05,460
Oh.

1276
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:14,180
Oh, come on!

1277
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:15,960
Asshole!

1278
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:22,220
Okay.

1279
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:24,040
Let me try again.

1280
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,480
I've never Come on.

1281
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,320
Come on.

1282
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:39,180
Okay, we got one.

1283
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:48,600
Let's kill these guys before I potentially unleash any other creatures upon me.

1284
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:55,710
Girl got a mean swing.

1285
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:56,470
Yeah, she do.

1286
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:57,810
We love her for it.

1287
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:02,840
Oh, come on.

1288
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,500
It just sits there.

1289
01:31:08,640 --> 01:31:10,720
This is when I wish I had a ranged weapon.

1290
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,590
Like guys like this.

1291
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:21,710
Okay, can I please?

1292
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:24,430
Oh, I was too early.

1293
01:31:25,370 --> 01:31:27,270
Ah, I messed up.

1294
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:31,780
Yeah.

1295
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,460
Oh, nice.

1296
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,500
Oh my gosh.

1297
01:31:37,240 --> 01:31:37,840
More?

1298
01:31:39,620 --> 01:32:12,180
I love the way they kind of look so sassy when they're like walking away they're like with their hair all flowing so many guys all right let's look around a little bit before we do that steel pipe what am i a joke to you another emma wait this is huge okay so there is still something over here Actually,

1299
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:14,480
I'm going to go save because we killed some guys.

1300
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1301
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:24,980
All right.

1302
01:32:29,720 --> 01:32:34,880
All right, so I think he's behind whatever creature is here is behind that door.

1303
01:32:35,460 --> 01:32:37,400
But we can check this door as well.

1304
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:39,900
What's behind?

1305
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:43,420
Critter door number one.

1306
01:32:45,780 --> 01:33:24,200
anything over here anything anything of note anything a bandage okay anything else literally anything okay alright I was constantly saving in this place too I don't blame you it's so big there's so much to explore and if you die there's so much you have to do again in my freaky TARDIS house.

1307
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:26,840
Um.

1308
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,860
I don't know how far this goes.

1309
01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:34,800
Golly.

1310
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:40,420
I guess let's just see what's behind the door.

1311
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:47,340
Being extra cautious.

1312
01:33:48,900 --> 01:33:48,980
Oh.

1313
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,560
Oh gosh, we're so close to whatever it is.

1314
01:33:55,610 --> 01:33:56,570
Okay, nothing in here.

1315
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:57,610
I don't know.

1316
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,530
This feels strange.

1317
01:34:00,010 --> 01:34:02,130
Like, I feel like I'm going into a boss room for some reason.

1318
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:05,570
Oh,

1319
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:13,420
this is spooky.

1320
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:16,440
Ouch.

1321
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,480
I tried dodging.

1322
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,540
These guys hit hard.

1323
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:21,840
Ouch!

1324
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:22,520
Gosh.

1325
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:33,740
I'm just leading around.

1326
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:34,640
out here.

1327
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:36,300
Come.

1328
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:43,780
No?

1329
01:34:45,260 --> 01:34:45,800
Oh.

1330
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:46,980
Oh, geez.

1331
01:34:47,260 --> 01:34:47,460
Okay.

1332
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,040
Alright, now we have plenty of room.

1333
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:50,880
Yeah!

1334
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:54,800
Oh.

1335
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,240
Ow, Jellum.

1336
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:00,280
Oh, my gosh.

1337
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:01,260
He gets me first.

1338
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,260
Okay.

1339
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:08,580
My weapon.

1340
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,140
Alright, time to switch to kitchen knife.

1341
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:14,180
Plenty of room.

1342
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:33,220
room for the monster too yeah but like it's hard I don't want to hit the walls it's like so annoying that's why I'd rather just lead them to the lead them to an area take two

1343
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:56,260
oh okay see I feel like I was right that this leads to to some sort of, okay, I'm gonna come back here last.

1344
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:04,680
I wanna say you inspired me to pass out candy this year so I pretend to be dead in the truck of my car holding a cauldron of candy.

1345
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,520
All the kids said, trick or veto?

1346
01:36:07,140 --> 01:36:08,660
Because you're always a treat.

1347
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:10,640
What are you talking about?

1348
01:36:15,380 --> 01:36:17,480
Can't tell if you're serious or not.

1349
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:21,460
Not about the trick or veto, but you giving out candy.

1350
01:36:21,680 --> 01:36:21,940
Oh, wait.

1351
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:24,640
Sounds fun, though.

1352
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,500
I think I need to make a decision.

1353
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:45,680
Okay, what I'm going to do...

1354
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:47,200
I just saved.

1355
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:48,700
Oh, it's 700!

1356
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,560
I thought it was 500.

1357
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,260
Okay, I think I just need to increase my abilities.

1358
01:36:55,880 --> 01:37:00,220
I think maybe I will do the Omamori slot, and then I will save up for health.

1359
01:37:02,060 --> 01:37:02,420
Potentially.

1360
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:06,340
What I could do is the Omamori slot, I could do increased stamina.

1361
01:37:07,200 --> 01:37:08,580
I really was in my trunk.

1362
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,560
My booty hurts.

1363
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:12,580
Sounds fun.

1364
01:37:13,820 --> 01:37:15,540
Always bring the best form of entertainment.

1365
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:16,460
You always make me smile.

1366
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:17,300
We don't...

1367
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,080
Oh, so good.

1368
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:18,960
Thank you.

1369
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:21,340
Thank you.

1370
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:22,800
Okay, Omamori.

1371
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,680
And we save for health.

1372
01:37:26,340 --> 01:37:27,420
And let's add an...

1373
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:28,620
Let's do...

1374
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:31,000
Maybe like...

1375
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,720
The stamina one.

1376
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,360
Especially if we're aiming to increase our health next.

1377
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:36,860
So...

1378
01:37:41,660 --> 01:37:50,840
I'm going to save this room because it looks fancy and special and we're gonna go take care of whatever the hecky is going on in here.

1379
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,160
I think this door probably opens, just kidding.

1380
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:54,600
Of course it doesn't.

1381
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:56,040
All right.

1382
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:02,890
I don't want to turn my back on this area either, but...

1383
01:38:04,370 --> 01:38:04,850
Hello!

1384
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,210
Do you see me?

1385
01:38:08,350 --> 01:38:09,570
Oh, no you don't?

1386
01:38:09,850 --> 01:38:10,470
Yes, you do.

1387
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:11,130
No, you don't.

1388
01:38:11,730 --> 01:38:12,130
Okay.

1389
01:38:14,490 --> 01:38:16,250
Suggest you?

1390
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,120
Took care of her.

1391
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,700
Give me some capsules.

1392
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:35,880
Um, cool.

1393
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:38,980
That was pretty hardcore.

1394
01:38:41,180 --> 01:38:42,600
Snake would be proud?

1395
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:43,740
You think so?

1396
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:46,160
You really think so?

1397
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:52,160
Oh, this is the room I didn't go in before.

1398
01:38:53,660 --> 01:38:56,160
I sure hope I didn't, like, Furoshiki.

1399
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,180
Increases inventory capacity!

1400
01:38:58,940 --> 01:39:02,760
I was going to say, I hope I didn't, like, miss something out that was going to soft lock me or something.

1401
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:09,200
But I remember we have to go back there anyway, because the pictures and stuff.

1402
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:11,800
Ancient wisdom passed down by our ancestors.

1403
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,500
Used to wrap things up and carry them around.

1404
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:16,540
Good thing I always prefer function over fashion.

1405
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:18,400
Yeah!

1406
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,660
Good find.

1407
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:22,420
I thought that was a gnome.

1408
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:23,800
I don't know why.

1409
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:24,700
And a toolkit!

1410
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,620
Wait, this room is awesome!

1411
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:29,340
And a propane tube!

1412
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,940
A pipeline that can be connected to a stove.

1413
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:33,240
Looks old but works fine.

1414
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:37,360
Okay.

1415
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,480
What are we using the tube for?

1416
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:45,270
What's this bird pattern?

1417
01:39:45,950 --> 01:39:46,270
I don't know.

1418
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,170
And then there, I think there was one other door over here.

1419
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:57,570
Oh, um, uh, uh, whoa!

1420
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:02,690
Oh.

1421
01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:05,570
Wow!

1422
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:07,330
Whoa!

1423
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:11,030
Oh, he's looking at me.

1424
01:40:11,690 --> 01:40:12,290
Ew!

1425
01:40:15,410 --> 01:40:17,170
I should leave right away.

1426
01:40:20,820 --> 01:40:21,500
Hmm.

1427
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,820
Okay, y'all have to tell me twice.

1428
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:35,960
That might have been one of the cooler things we've seen in this game.

1429
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,480
That was really neat.

1430
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:48,640
Okay.

1431
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,300
Also, I'm gonna use the toolkit once again.

1432
01:40:56,740 --> 01:40:59,340
This thing is not very durable, but I like it so much.

1433
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:29,960
uh oh whoops i'm willing to you know keep it maintained until i find a new one or something was i think it was a kokashi doll wasn't it or am i wrong all right let's try this room now oh it's stuck oh wait no wait just just move it oh wait no way i i waited to go back to the

1434
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:33,720
Uh...

1435
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,020
No way.

1436
01:41:35,420 --> 01:41:37,280
I thought this was like a big deal.

1437
01:41:42,660 --> 01:41:44,840
Oh, it won't even let me try again.

1438
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:46,760
Just give up.

1439
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:47,280
Bozo.

1440
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:49,300
Okay.

1441
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:53,080
Okay.

1442
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,940
It's a lore vase.

1443
01:41:58,240 --> 01:42:02,160
Okay, one other thing I want to try with this guy real quick.

1444
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:06,120
It looks like I could maybe stab him in the eyeball.

1445
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:08,120
I'm gonna try.

1446
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:12,160
So maybe I just go through that other door.

1447
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:14,440
But before then, I want to try this.

1448
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:16,640
Oh.

1449
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:17,940
Okay.

1450
01:42:22,410 --> 01:42:23,410
So creepy.

1451
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:24,790
So cool.

1452
01:42:28,070 --> 01:42:29,530
Okay, okay, okay.

1453
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:34,010
Creepy ambience.

1454
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,170
Let's go through this door now.

1455
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:41,110
It'll let me, I imagine, because it's on.

1456
01:42:42,110 --> 01:42:43,690
Does this take me to the beginning?

1457
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:47,530
No?

1458
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:50,010
Uh...

1459
01:42:50,010 --> 01:42:51,210
Wait, yes?

1460
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:52,930
Yes, it does.

1461
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:53,890
Oh, okay.

1462
01:42:59,170 --> 01:43:03,760
Oh, I killed you guys!

1463
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:14,160
I killed you!

1464
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:16,920
I killed everything in here.

1465
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:18,120
You can't come back.

1466
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:19,240
It's unfair.

1467
01:43:25,030 --> 01:43:25,510
Okay.

1468
01:43:27,770 --> 01:43:30,050
If only we had our Yeti powers.

1469
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:30,910
Seriously.

1470
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:35,170
So I'm guessing... Oh.

1471
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:43,250
I'm guessing the scale goes in here and then the fox goes on one side and the sword goes on the other whenever we get those.

1472
01:43:44,970 --> 01:43:46,090
What else do I hear?

1473
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:50,610
Oh my gosh.

1474
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:53,810
Where did you come from?

1475
01:43:56,350 --> 01:43:56,910
Ouch.

1476
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,540
Oh, no.

1477
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,520
I dodge and you still leaped at me.

1478
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:11,110
Oh, what are you doing?

1479
01:44:22,300 --> 01:44:24,280
What happens when you does that?

1480
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,580
Oh, it goes like cycle mode.

1481
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:29,160
Oh.

1482
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:29,920
Ah!

1483
01:44:33,210 --> 01:44:33,790
Yeah!

1484
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:47,100
He doesn't go psycho mode, he goes freak mode.

1485
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,600
It looks like a fire is happening.

1486
01:44:51,760 --> 01:44:53,040
Oh, I think I was right.

1487
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:53,540
Wait.

1488
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:55,880
Oh!

1489
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:56,640
Whoa.

1490
01:44:58,120 --> 01:44:58,700
Oh.

1491
01:44:59,180 --> 01:45:00,740
No, the opposite of fire.

1492
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:02,040
Water.

1493
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,160
Whoa!

1494
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,460
Crazy visual!

1495
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:22,880
It's kind of funny, just like...

1496
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:24,960
Here we go.

1497
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,840
White bird and fox plate.

1498
01:45:30,140 --> 01:45:33,520
A wooden block with a white bird painted on one side and a fox on the other.

1499
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:34,520
Wonder...

1500
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:39,290
What was that?

1501
01:45:43,660 --> 01:45:45,160
Gonna run for it?

1502
01:45:52,700 --> 01:45:55,680
In fact, I'm going to save right here instead.

1503
01:45:56,840 --> 01:45:58,100
Okay, we got two crests.

1504
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:04,850
No, thank you.

1505
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:06,530
Let's put the other crest here.

1506
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:07,730
Wait, let me read this again.

1507
01:46:10,070 --> 01:46:10,550
Foxes.

1508
01:46:11,650 --> 01:46:14,930
The sun rose behind the foxes back and set behind the swords.

1509
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,520
So does it...

1510
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:44,260
east hot dog hot dog happy slashing okay share my day my car broke down six miles from US Idol Festival now I can't make it to the concert or meet a greet how will I ever recover wait a lottery what lottery wait what I'm

1511
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:53,340
so sorry wait hold on I have to read this again.

1512
01:46:53,980 --> 01:46:57,780
The sun rises behind the fox's back.

1513
01:46:57,980 --> 01:47:00,840
So maybe this one.

1514
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:04,260
And then, what is this?

1515
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:07,420
Okay.

1516
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:09,520
Okay.

1517
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:13,120
So we found two of the three crests.

1518
01:47:13,540 --> 01:47:15,960
We did the picture frames.

1519
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:19,280
What?

1520
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:20,880
Oh, wait.

1521
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:22,220
What is this?

1522
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,660
to.

1523
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,440
There's another one?

1524
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:26,960
Wait.

1525
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:30,340
Oh, because this is to shoe.

1526
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,400
This is to shoe.

1527
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,360
Ah, okay.

1528
01:47:35,940 --> 01:47:38,620
Maybe we get the one to shoe in here, I imagine.

1529
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,380
But what other puzzle was there?

1530
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,320
Seems like some doors are unchecked.

1531
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:48,480
Oh, you're right.

1532
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:50,020
You're right, you're right.

1533
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:51,140
Oh, geez.

1534
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:52,880
Oh, geez.

1535
01:47:53,440 --> 01:47:53,780
Oh, geez.

1536
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,940
Okay, I just saved, though, so it should be okay.

1537
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:58,060
We'll go down this way.

1538
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,080
But I don't think...

1539
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:04,320
If we just got one in here, I don't imagine there's another one.

1540
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:06,700
You know?

1541
01:48:06,920 --> 01:48:07,200
Oh.

1542
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,640
Oh, okay.

1543
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,480
Inazushi, let's go.

1544
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:17,000
I will sell that.

1545
01:48:18,320 --> 01:48:19,560
For big bucks.

1546
01:48:21,540 --> 01:48:23,720
I think I just didn't...

1547
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:23,780
Oh, okay.

1548
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,080
Yeah, we'll check my notes in a second.

1549
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:30,160
I think it was that in fact that I just didn't check them before.

1550
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:36,440
I think I went through the door and I forgot to check my

1551
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:44,580
notes.

1552
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:45,780
Wait, my notes.

1553
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:50,600
Okay, I did the scales, obviously.

1554
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:54,640
I did the photos.

1555
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,100
Wait, there was not another puzzle, was there?

1556
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:01,900
Yes.

1557
01:49:05,140 --> 01:49:08,340
Maybe it goes to the room in here this time.

1558
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:14,160
I definitely remember not going in here before because I was spooked.

1559
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:28,680
Do you need a propane tube?

1560
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,480
It does!

1561
01:49:31,740 --> 01:49:32,480
Oh my gosh!

1562
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:35,220
I'm making soup?

1563
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:37,620
Oh!

1564
01:49:38,020 --> 01:49:38,420
Oh!

1565
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:41,020
Oh!

1566
01:49:42,060 --> 01:49:42,700
Fletching key!

1567
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:43,180
Ah!

1568
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:45,600
The door with the bird on it!

1569
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:49,020
A key with a bird pattern on the back obtained from the melted piece of wax.

1570
01:49:50,200 --> 01:49:51,740
Oh my god!

1571
01:49:53,060 --> 01:49:53,920
Oh my gosh.

1572
01:49:54,200 --> 01:49:54,980
Also, oh my god.

1573
01:49:55,780 --> 01:49:56,000
Ouch!

1574
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,040
You bitch!

1575
01:49:58,280 --> 01:49:58,760
Please!

1576
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,220
Please!

1577
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:00,260
Ow!

1578
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:01,080
Gosh, no!

1579
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,700
Oh my god, I might die here.

1580
01:50:03,480 --> 01:50:03,960
No!

1581
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:05,540
Oh!

1582
01:50:06,460 --> 01:50:07,440
Oh, this is bad.

1583
01:50:07,660 --> 01:50:08,940
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

1584
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,580
Time to leave, time to leave.

1585
01:50:15,620 --> 01:50:17,640
Time to leave while I heal.

1586
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:22,520
And I'm just gonna go.

1587
01:50:22,700 --> 01:50:22,960
I'm going.

1588
01:50:23,220 --> 01:50:23,500
I'm leaving.

1589
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:24,240
I'm leaving.

1590
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,480
We're going to the next room.

1591
01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:25,960
We're going.

1592
01:50:26,080 --> 01:50:26,360
We're leaving.

1593
01:50:26,660 --> 01:50:26,860
We're leaving.

1594
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm leaving?

1595
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:32,620
Okay.

1596
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,480
Holy cow.

1597
01:50:35,180 --> 01:50:35,420
Okay.

1598
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,800
We need to go to the next one again.

1599
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,860
Ah, shoot.

1600
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:48,380
Ouch.

1601
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:52,060
Stop it.

1602
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,300
Okay, we got her.

1603
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,080
Thanks for keeping me company on a two-hour drive home.

1604
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,840
Your webinars really keep me sane in traffic.

1605
01:51:10,460 --> 01:51:11,500
Glad you like my webinars.

1606
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,780
We're just gonna run for it.

1607
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:47,210
Wait, have I...

1608
01:51:48,490 --> 01:51:50,350
I didn't try opening this?

1609
01:51:51,490 --> 01:51:52,150
Could I before?

1610
01:51:53,570 --> 01:51:54,330
Oh my gosh.

1611
01:51:56,790 --> 01:52:00,490
I'm saving literally over everything just in this one house.

1612
01:52:01,690 --> 01:52:04,950
Because I'm afraid of like kind of soft locking myself with...

1613
01:52:04,950 --> 01:52:04,950
okay.

1614
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:07,770
Okay, I hear monster.

1615
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:14,610
I'm afraid because I'm running out of weapons so quickly, you know what I mean?

1616
01:52:15,210 --> 01:52:21,770
I guess there are a bunch of steel bars or...

1617
01:52:25,070 --> 01:52:26,830
Oh, nasty, please!

1618
01:52:27,730 --> 01:52:29,150
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1619
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:30,290
Wait, oh gosh.

1620
01:52:30,930 --> 01:52:31,770
I'm just gonna run.

1621
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:37,810
I know there will probably be other stuff down here.

1622
01:52:39,850 --> 01:52:41,150
Probably right around this corner.

1623
01:52:41,650 --> 01:52:41,890
Really?

1624
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:42,590
Nothing?

1625
01:52:43,090 --> 01:52:43,530
Lucky.

1626
01:52:47,990 --> 01:52:49,490
Don't say that, please.

1627
01:52:50,250 --> 01:52:50,870
Don't say that, please.

1628
01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:51,710
Oh.

1629
01:52:52,610 --> 01:52:53,250
Hinako!

1630
01:52:54,190 --> 01:52:54,650
that's all.

1631
01:52:55,690 --> 01:52:57,170
Oh, what's that?

1632
01:52:57,870 --> 01:52:58,550
No, my god.

1633
01:52:58,550 --> 01:52:58,770
I know.

1634
01:52:59,470 --> 01:53:02,010
It's your dad's grotesque, and that's why.

1635
01:53:02,010 --> 01:53:02,350
Oh?

1636
01:53:02,770 --> 01:53:03,750
My god.

1637
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:04,530
Oh, what?

1638
01:53:04,530 --> 01:53:09,430
In order for me to crack into all the money and all she 부분ers, all the money saved is your father's sorry.

1639
01:53:11,050 --> 01:53:11,510
My god.

1640
01:53:11,510 --> 01:53:11,730
My thaw!

1641
01:53:11,950 --> 01:53:16,110
Mom and my şeyme even came out of him for being病 otherwise.

1642
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:21,810
No.

1643
01:53:27,090 --> 01:53:27,490
No.

1644
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:30,630
Wow.

1645
01:53:30,650 --> 01:53:30,730
What?

1646
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:35,090
No.

1647
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,470
Whoa.

1648
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:35,530
What?

1649
01:53:35,670 --> 01:53:36,090
What?

1650
01:53:36,090 --> 01:53:36,290
Oh!

1651
01:53:36,290 --> 01:53:42,150
Oh, I'm sorry, but, oh, your son's got you come to come here.

1652
01:53:42,650 --> 01:53:42,870
Eh?

1653
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:44,310
That's it!

1654
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:46,010
Like a hoi.

1655
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:46,230
What?

1656
01:53:46,770 --> 01:54:01,590
He threw

1657
01:54:06,540 --> 01:54:07,700
a knife at her.

1658
01:54:09,580 --> 01:54:09,820
Insane.

1659
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:11,580
Okay.

1660
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,780
Okie dokie.

1661
01:54:15,740 --> 01:54:17,000
There's nothing else in here.

1662
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:18,440
Alright.

1663
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:34,320

1664
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:47,490
okay so we leave we go back okay time to run yeah time to run baby

1665
01:54:55,280 --> 01:54:56,540
oh just saved

1666
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:04,060
why my

1667
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:15,830
journal updated why oh mom

1668
01:55:18,950 --> 01:55:35,390
we'll read this real quick but then i saw that mannequin a woman's happiness begins with marriage she told me that every opportunity she got am i supposed to believe that she's actually happy with the life she has now in this house today my dad threw a knife it got stuck the tatami mat.

1669
01:55:36,070 --> 01:55:38,430
There are chips and dings all over the house.

1670
01:55:38,730 --> 01:55:40,610
Every last one is from when he threw something.

1671
01:55:41,210 --> 01:55:46,370
Is that what happiness is to my mother seeing her house in such a sorry state and full of scars?

1672
01:55:50,290 --> 01:55:55,650
I've heard that dad used to be a fisherman when he was younger and would go on long fishing trips way out at sea.

1673
01:55:56,110 --> 01:56:03,410
He managed to save up enough money doing that to open up a restaurant, a place where he could put his skills with a knife to use.

1674
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:24,150
It didn't work out though not only did he lose all his savings he took on new debt too now he spends his days drinking his life away in the sleepy little town that's a long way from sea he never even tries to cook anything anymore it's only when he complains about mom's food that he pretends to be some kind of important chef is

1675
01:56:27,530 --> 01:57:06,570
this new i used to think it was just my dad who was like this but after listening to all the married women around here complain every man seems just as bad while their husbands are just as short-tempered just as violent just as useless and do just as little to help out their wives i don't remember if i read this or not after learning this every grumpy old man in town i see reminds me of him when i think that i was born and raised just to support these horrible tyrants i lose all hope if everything works out they're going to give my father a lot of money i'm sure he's desperate to use it to pay back his debts is selling me to pay back his debts?

1676
01:57:07,410 --> 01:57:08,010
Huh?

1677
01:57:11,910 --> 01:57:13,230
Oh, my god.

1678
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:16,690
Are you the one that was getting me earlier?

1679
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:19,950
Get up!

1680
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:20,310
Get up!

1681
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:24,080
Die, monster!

1682
01:57:24,240 --> 01:57:24,500
Die!

1683
01:57:25,660 --> 01:57:26,260
Okay.

1684
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:27,880
We got her.

1685
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:28,400
Nice.

1686
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:29,100
Okay.

1687
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,060
Okay.

1688
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:31,620
Okay.

1689
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:36,740
Alright, and I think there's down that hallway.

1690
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:40,880
Alright, alright.

1691
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:42,060
Alright.

1692
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,140
Okay.

1693
01:57:45,940 --> 01:57:46,320
Alright.

1694
01:57:50,160 --> 01:57:50,620
Yeah.

1695
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,440
That thing.

1696
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:52,920
Alright.

1697
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,260
So I think probably...

1698
01:57:56,260 --> 01:57:56,980
Is this not it?

1699
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:05,850
Am I wrong?

1700
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:11,320
Check the clues again.

1701
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:11,680
Yeah.

1702
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:16,000
The sword and the fox fought battling upon a set of scales.

1703
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,700
Wait, the scales are gone!

1704
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:21,840
Okay, wait.

1705
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:27,980
Maybe it's like this.

1706
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:29,100
Aha!

1707
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:37,470
I'm gonna look around a bit.

1708
01:58:38,190 --> 01:58:39,150
Red capsules.

1709
01:58:46,220 --> 01:58:46,480
Okay.

1710
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:48,820
Pine tree emblem.

1711
01:58:50,380 --> 01:58:50,580
Oh!

1712
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:51,280
Oh!

1713
01:59:05,130 --> 01:59:05,990
What's she doing?

1714
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:09,440
Why she didn't want to talk to him?

1715
01:59:15,480 --> 01:59:15,740
Hello?

1716
01:59:19,480 --> 01:59:20,480
What's up?

1717
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:22,540
Hello?

1718
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:25,000
Oh, I can leave?

1719
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:37,540
Wait, will you help me?

1720
01:59:46,820 --> 01:59:49,720
Oh, you're so cute.

1721
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:05,080
First of all, why are you wearing that stupid outfit?

1722
02:00:07,880 --> 02:00:09,340
I don't know.

1723
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:11,480
I don't know.

1724
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:14,660
I don't know.

1725
02:00:15,620 --> 02:00:21,140
I don't know what I'm thinking.

1726
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:23,440
What do you mean?

1727
02:00:24,120 --> 02:00:25,320
What are you talking about?

1728
02:00:26,780 --> 02:00:28,900
I'm probably...

1729
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:29,880
You're not me.

1730
02:00:31,340 --> 02:00:32,160
I'm not you.

1731
02:00:32,740 --> 02:00:32,840
I'm not.

1732
02:00:32,840 --> 02:00:33,860
I'm not.

1733
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:35,840
It's true, duh.

1734
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:38,980
If I was Hinako, then who are you?

1735
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:41,440
Oh, Hinako is the same.

1736
02:00:43,180 --> 02:00:43,900
But...

1737
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:46,400
My heart is...

1738
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:46,600
Hmm?

1739
02:00:46,820 --> 02:00:48,080
Shimizu Hinako is not...

1740
02:00:48,980 --> 02:00:49,200
Hmm?

1741
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:49,980
What are you saying?

1742
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:54,840
What are you talking about?

1743
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,100
Oh.

1744
02:00:55,700 --> 02:00:56,420
Oh.

1745
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:56,700
Oh.

1746
02:00:57,100 --> 02:00:57,820
Oh.

1747
02:00:57,820 --> 02:00:58,000
Oh.

1748
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:58,040
Oh.

1749
02:00:58,040 --> 02:00:58,680
Oh.

1750
02:00:58,840 --> 02:01:01,060
It's true, duh.

1751
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:02,040
Oh!

1752
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:02,580
Oh!

1753
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:13,720
My body is...

1754
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:16,300
My body is...

1755
02:01:16,300 --> 02:01:17,440
My body is...

1756
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:18,700
My body is...

1757
02:01:18,700 --> 02:01:18,860
My body is...

1758
02:01:18,860 --> 02:01:19,520
I want to talk to you...

1759
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:23,280
...shimizu Hinako to be really honest with you.

1760
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:25,100
Wow.

1761
02:01:25,660 --> 02:01:26,240
We're...

1762
02:01:26,240 --> 02:01:28,520
...we're all right.

1763
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,820
...and we're all right.

1764
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,120
You have this stupid body, your heart.

1765
02:01:44,140 --> 02:01:45,120
If you have this stupid body, your heart.

1766
02:01:45,360 --> 02:01:51,340
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

1767
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:52,500
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no.

1768
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:54,620
It's not only you, not only.

1769
02:01:54,620 --> 02:01:55,220
I'll kill you.

1770
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:56,840
My father and my mother will kill me.

1771
02:01:57,660 --> 02:02:00,100
This house, this city will be killed.

1772
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:02,880
I'll kill you.

1773
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:04,800
Rinko and Saku-ko will kill me.

1774
02:02:05,880 --> 02:02:06,820
And of course...

1775
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:07,820
Shu?

1776
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:12,140
You know, your very important partner, too.

1777
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:13,740
Shu, where?

1778
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:15,620
Where are you?

1779
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:16,160
Where are you going to be?

1780
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:16,800
Hey.

1781
02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:20,800
Shu is so much important.

1782
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:38,480
I love her voice actress.

1783
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:39,400
She's so good.

1784
02:02:56,100 --> 02:02:57,560
She's so good.

1785
02:02:58,540 --> 02:02:59,800
Her actress is doing a playthrough too.

1786
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:00,880
Wait, that's so awesome.

1787
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:05,280
So good.

1788
02:03:09,160 --> 02:03:10,420
Don't say that.

1789
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:18,540
Okay, we gotta go through here.

1790
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:21,920
I think I'm just gonna run past...

1791
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:22,900
Damn!

1792
02:03:24,160 --> 02:03:25,560
So much we're running past!

1793
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:28,300
Ouch!

1794
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:28,600
Ouch!

1795
02:03:29,900 --> 02:03:31,420
Oh my god, wait, I don't want to die.

1796
02:03:31,740 --> 02:03:32,420
Wait, I don't want to die.

1797
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:33,500
I don't want to die!

1798
02:03:33,700 --> 02:03:34,420
I don't want to die!

1799
02:03:46,040 --> 02:03:46,440
Okay.

1800
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:47,740
Yeah.

1801
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:53,100
Well, that sucks.

1802
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:56,480
Um, let's see.

1803
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,620
Well, it doesn't really matter.

1804
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:03,580
It just saves anyway.

1805
02:04:04,160 --> 02:04:04,160
Okay.

1806
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:07,680
Can you guys, like, fight each other?

1807
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:09,680
Why can't there be, like, monster...

1808
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,960
Why can't the monsters fight each other, you know?

1809
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,940
Just throw up yourself to death.

1810
02:04:21,180 --> 02:04:21,860
Oh, gosh.

1811
02:04:21,980 --> 02:04:22,700

Oh, one up.

1816
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:10,490
She lives.

1817
02:05:11,070 --> 02:05:11,350
Somehow.

1818
02:05:12,930 --> 02:05:15,350
Open the door to the Rube Shoe's voice came from.

1819
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:15,830
Okay.

1820
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:17,770
Now can I run past?

1821
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,730
Now do you think it's okay?

1822
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:22,810
Probably.

1823
02:05:24,230 --> 02:05:24,870
There we go.

1824
02:05:29,830 --> 02:05:30,330
Bye.

1825
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:30,590
Bye.

1826
02:05:39,920 --> 02:05:40,820
Oh, don't say that.

1827
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:43,340
Wait, where are you?

1828
02:05:43,480 --> 02:05:44,660
I thought you were gonna be right behind.

1829
02:05:45,740 --> 02:05:46,600
Oh, jeez.

1830
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:51,860
Wait, though.

1831
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:53,340
Ah, Seiko!

1832
02:05:56,200 --> 02:05:57,700
We'll take that.

1833
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,380
Whoa.

1834
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:06,280
Seiko.

1835
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:13,360
Okay, we made it.

1836
02:06:13,860 --> 02:06:14,880
Maybe...

1837
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:15,100
Oh.

1838
02:06:16,420 --> 02:06:17,160
Hold on.

1839
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:17,680
Oh, wow.

1840
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,940
There's like...

1841
02:06:18,940 --> 02:06:19,120
Whoa.

1842
02:06:20,200 --> 02:06:21,860
Uh, something big's coming up, huh?

1843
02:06:23,180 --> 02:06:24,340
Not good.

1844
02:06:27,260 --> 02:06:30,920
Just so close to...

1845
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:37,900
Even that though, 60 wouldn't give me enough to offer it for health.

1846
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:38,960
That's okay.

1847
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:40,580
Wait.

1848
02:06:42,060 --> 02:06:42,860
Capsules.

1849
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:48,500
This doesn't seem very good.

1850
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:50,440
Oh, oh, okay.

1851
02:06:51,320 --> 02:06:52,220
Oh, oh, okay.

1852
02:06:53,540 --> 02:06:54,000
Oh, okay.

1853
02:07:00,370 --> 02:07:01,610
You two don't look.

1854
02:07:09,110 --> 02:07:09,670
Oh!

1855
02:07:09,670 --> 02:07:11,270
Oh, she's like all burnt up.

1856
02:07:25,410 --> 02:07:26,970
Yeah, we did, we did that.

1857
02:07:27,230 --> 02:07:27,770
Yeah.

1858
02:07:30,470 --> 02:07:32,170
Oh yeah, what's with the buckets?

1859
02:07:33,010 --> 02:07:34,130
Oh my gosh, it's the knife.

1860
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:35,650
My head's blocking it, but...

1861
02:07:48,340 --> 02:07:48,820
Oh.

1862
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:00,840
Oh.

1863
02:08:02,180 --> 02:08:02,400
Oh.

1864
02:08:03,980 --> 02:08:04,500
Oh.

1865
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:06,520
Oh.

1866
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:07,800
Oh.

1867
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:08,160
Oh.

1868
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,020
Oh.

1869
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:09,880
Oh.

1870
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:10,760
Oh.

1871
02:08:16,820 --> 02:08:18,600
Why is his mouth like that?

1872
02:08:29,460 --> 02:08:30,420
This is...

1873
02:08:30,420 --> 02:08:32,480
This isn't cannibalism, right?

1874
02:08:34,680 --> 02:08:36,000
Yeah, he's super uncanny.

1875
02:08:36,220 --> 02:08:36,680
It's so creepy.

1876
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:40,420
Am I going to have to fight my dad?

1877
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:41,800
Oh, no.

1878
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:47,680
Oh,

1879
02:09:26,560 --> 02:09:26,560
gosh.

1880
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:28,160
Okay.

1881
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:28,960
Oh, no.

1882
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:32,100
Shut up.

1883
02:09:32,900 --> 02:09:34,520
thing with the blade at the beginning.

1884
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,600
I like how she has the steel pipe.

1885
02:09:52,780 --> 02:09:57,000
I guess that's like the default, like the main weapon.

1886
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:02,000
Oh, and mom too!

1887
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,640
Oh my gosh, she throws stuff at you.

1888
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:10,800
Okay.

1889
02:10:12,980 --> 02:10:13,460
Wow!

1890
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,140
Wow!

1891
02:10:14,260 --> 02:10:14,920
Oh my gosh!

1892
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:17,900
This seems kind of brutal.

1893
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:18,920
I'm not gonna lie.

1894
02:10:21,380 --> 02:10:22,220
Oh gosh!

1895
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:26,280
Oh

1896
02:10:38,310 --> 02:10:39,330

1897
02:10:40,410 --> 02:10:41,430

1898
02:10:41,670 --> 02:10:42,650
Oh my gosh!

1899
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:43,330

1900
02:10:43,530 --> 02:10:45,330
Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1901
02:10:45,370 --> 02:10:46,250
No, no, no, no, no!

1902
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:50,870
Oh my god, please!

1903
02:10:51,390 --> 02:10:52,110
Oh my god, mom!

1904
02:10:53,230 --> 02:10:53,650
Okay,

1905
02:11:07,210 --> 02:11:08,110
we're dead, we're dead.

1906
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,880
She like throws you to him!

1907
02:11:13,440 --> 02:11:14,540
Oh, we're so dead.

1908
02:11:19,500 --> 02:11:20,200
Ouch, ouch.

1909
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:22,280
I didn't realize she had one more attack.

1910
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:24,220
Ah!

1911
02:11:26,340 --> 02:11:27,040
Run away, run away.

1912
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:28,600
Run away.

1913
02:11:28,800 --> 02:11:28,940
Run away.

1914
02:11:29,140 --> 02:11:29,320
Run away.

1915
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:36,680
Oh, you are so rude.

1916
02:11:38,700 --> 02:11:39,340
I don't know.

1917
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,300
I feel like I need to focus on the mom first.

1918
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:49,440
Oh!

1919
02:11:52,740 --> 02:11:53,140

Oh, that was so close.

1924
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:05,320
That was so close.

1925
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:10,700
I have no stamina.

1926
02:12:16,090 --> 02:12:17,530
Oh, I should have dodged.

1927
02:12:22,660 --> 02:12:24,180
I tried to dodge, but that's okay.

1928
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:25,740
I was able to heal anyway.

1929
02:12:27,140 --> 02:12:27,500

1930
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:28,220

1952
02:15:45,290 --> 02:15:47,870
He's just dropping all his innards.

Good terms?

1960

02:17:28,640 --> 02:17:30,580

1969
02:18:02,070 --> 02:18:04,410
I think it just would have been better if they made the...

1970
02:18:05,110 --> 02:18:06,770
The hair less stringy.

1971
02:18:07,550 --> 02:18:07,730
Like...

1972
02:18:18,050 --> 02:18:27,730
It's like so stringy and thin like it looks gross and not like a spooky way.

1973
02:18:30,610 --> 02:18:31,230
Oh,

1974
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:34,940

Drink up.

02:18:47,520 --> 02:18:49,960
You're gonna make me have to pee.

1980
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:53,660

1981
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:56,680
Oh.

1982
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:02,100
Oh gosh, her mouth though.

1983
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,200
She doesn't look good.

1984
02:19:03,680 --> 02:19:06,220
She actually looks quite bad.

1985
02:19:08,820 --> 02:19:11,160
I think she's allergic to that stuff.

1986
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:15,660
Also known as sake.

1987
02:19:16,060 --> 02:19:16,300
Yeah.

1988
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:33,440
This is just what women look like without makeup.

1989
02:19:36,300 --> 02:19:37,840
You're so right.

1990
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,260
What's this?

1991
02:19:42,740 --> 02:19:42,800
Ooh.

1992
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:47,580
Oh, oh.

1993
02:19:52,160 --> 02:19:52,640
Again?

1994
02:19:53,360 --> 02:19:55,200
You're not going to leave me this time, are you?

1995
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,500
Funny ears fit more now.

1996
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,160
Welcome back to Vembo Ship.

1997
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:04,040
Thank you so much.

1998
02:20:06,900 --> 02:20:07,840
Oh, there he goes.

1999
02:20:08,380 --> 02:20:08,840
Typical.

2000
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:11,420
This guy.

2001
02:20:17,790 --> 02:20:18,150
Broach.

2002
02:20:18,250 --> 02:20:22,310
This very old and precious broach seems to have a reassuring power.

2003
02:20:25,490 --> 02:20:25,970
Explore.

2004
02:20:29,290 --> 02:20:34,390
Are things not going to attack me now because they're like, oh, she belongs to that guy.

2005
02:20:37,690 --> 02:20:39,150
Varno, thank you so much for the tiny gift.

2006
02:20:39,330 --> 02:20:39,990
Thank you.

2007
02:20:40,550 --> 02:20:40,890
Thank you.

2008
02:20:41,130 --> 02:20:41,370
Thank you.

2009
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:46,880
I don't remember how to activate that.

2010
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:50,920
I think it was like L3 or something or whatever it was.

2011
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:06,200
There's not stuff around here, is there?

2012
02:21:06,520 --> 02:21:07,180
be exploring.

2013
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:08,580
I just realized.

2014
02:21:10,360 --> 02:21:11,380
He didn't leave any trinkets.

2015
02:21:11,620 --> 02:21:12,000
Oh, wait.

2016
02:21:14,940 --> 02:21:17,740
Let's save for sure, since I just beat a boss.

2017
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:20,020
I just beat... I just beat Dad.

2018
02:21:22,940 --> 02:21:23,420
So...

2019
02:21:23,420 --> 02:21:24,420
Let's save.

2020
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:26,360
Happy November, Mindo.

2021
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:27,200
Happy November!

2022
02:21:27,880 --> 02:21:28,780
Thank you so much!

2023
02:21:28,980 --> 02:21:29,340
Whoa!

2024
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:30,520
Kamik, thank you!

2025
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:34,040
Welcome back, and thank you for the 50 gifts, and holy moly.

2026
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:34,880
Thank you.

2027
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,940
Investigate the area

2028
02:21:53,640 --> 02:22:15,400
I would say that maybe things don't bother us anymore because You know because we have the brooch but I guess This is a silent hill game They wouldn't make it that easy Prove your intent with the crests 3 Show what lies deep within your heart Let the line of foxes guide you Offer the crests and lay bare your soul

2029
02:22:19,060 --> 02:22:50,100
more crests more crests awesome love it a black bird wishes to take the white bird the white bird wishes to resist the foe oh sorry whips should wouldn't contain themselves if they saw kitsune minto with her fluffy tails touch fluffy tails The white bird wishes to resist.

2030
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:52,760
The fox brings along his followers in triumph.

2031
02:22:53,380 --> 02:22:56,000
He notices not the two birds in conflict.

2032
02:22:58,880 --> 02:23:01,280
So it's not my problem.

2033
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:03,460
I'm not going to talk to these stupid birds.

2034
02:23:05,180 --> 02:23:05,580
Okay.

2035
02:23:09,300 --> 02:23:09,620
Okay.

2036
02:23:11,480 --> 02:23:11,980
Okay.

2037
02:23:13,160 --> 02:23:13,380
Okay.

2038
02:23:13,380 --> 02:23:13,500
This...

2039
02:23:15,620 --> 02:23:16,820
This looks pretty...

2040
02:23:16,840 --> 02:23:22,160
bad i don't think we don't want to go close to them if they're covered in blood on the bottom

2041
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:46,610
okay oasis oh yeah sources family physicians log february 13th dawn mr hidetoshi and his wife have passed away one after the other at time of death the skin all over their bodies was covered in sores and had begun

2042
02:23:51,090 --> 02:23:59,830
Slout Slout Slout Slout Slout What do you mean daddy issues weren't the bottom bars?

2043
02:24:00,190 --> 02:24:00,370
Right!

2044
02:24:02,710 --> 02:24:14,530
Sloughing Sloughing off The smell was indescribably awful I could not bear to take a closer look The head of the...

2045
02:24:14,530 --> 02:24:22,550
The head of the house did not give permission to perform autopsies on the bodies There will be no funeral sent to be cremated immediately.

2046
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:24,710
February 14th, midnight.

2047
02:24:25,330 --> 02:24:26,730
The eldest son has passed away.

2048
02:24:27,290 --> 02:24:30,770
Again, there will be no funeral, and the body will be sent away for cremation.

2049
02:24:31,430 --> 02:24:36,570
The eldest and second-born daughters are also experiencing symptoms that are worsening by the hour.

2050
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:41,130
I believe they will be in critical condition by tomorrow, at the latest.

2051
02:24:42,630 --> 02:24:44,090
That's a hard word.

2052
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:50,930
Oh, that's right.

2053
02:24:53,430 --> 02:24:54,650
Do these do anything?

2054
02:24:55,630 --> 02:25:04,090
Oh, oh, whoa, aww, little babies.

2055
02:25:05,310 --> 02:25:06,070
Is there anything up here?

2056
02:25:06,470 --> 02:25:07,210
Anything in your mouth?

2057
02:25:08,330 --> 02:25:10,830
Let go, let go, spit it out.

2058
02:25:11,550 --> 02:25:12,790
You got anything in your mouth?

2059
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:13,990
Wait, what?

2060
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:18,070
Did it just make a noise at me?

2061
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:21,810
Spit it out, spit it out.

2062
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:29,140
middle.

2063
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:33,290
What do you mean?

2064
02:25:35,010 --> 02:25:35,990
Oh, he dropped that.

2065
02:25:36,150 --> 02:25:38,090
Oh, he did spit it out.

2066
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:41,530
Okay.

2067
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:43,950
It won't let me observe any of the other ones.

2068
02:25:44,890 --> 02:25:44,890
Hmm.

2069
02:25:46,590 --> 02:25:47,810
There was something on the first box?

2070
02:25:48,830 --> 02:25:49,270
There was?

2071
02:25:51,670 --> 02:25:52,250
Oh!

2072
02:25:53,450 --> 02:25:53,730
Ooh.

2073
02:26:02,870 --> 02:26:03,850
Ornate scroll.

2074
02:26:04,350 --> 02:26:06,230
Purify once and for all.

2075
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:08,490
Leave the of your world behind.

2076
02:26:13,430 --> 02:26:16,630
Well, thank you, guys.

2077
02:26:16,830 --> 02:26:18,310
I definitely did not see that at all.

2078
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:20,630
Thank you, thank you.

2079
02:26:24,450 --> 02:26:24,890
Oh, sorry.

2080
02:26:25,010 --> 02:26:25,830
I keep checking the map.

2081
02:26:26,010 --> 02:26:27,990
I think it's...

2082
02:26:30,450 --> 02:26:30,890
What?

2083
02:26:32,210 --> 02:26:32,650
Ah.

2084
02:26:34,670 --> 02:26:35,110
Oh.

2085
02:26:38,490 --> 02:26:39,410
I have the brooch!

2086
02:26:39,730 --> 02:26:40,510
Leave me alone!

2087
02:26:46,420 --> 02:26:48,100
Leave me alone, foul beast.

2088
02:26:50,360 --> 02:26:51,040
Umamori!

2089
02:26:51,480 --> 02:26:54,380
Slyly restores current max sanity after defeating enemies.

2090
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:54,780
Oh?

2091
02:26:56,080 --> 02:26:56,760
Okay.

2092
02:26:59,930 --> 02:27:01,510
I was thinking of stamina.

2093
02:27:03,530 --> 02:27:04,210
Doggo!

2094
02:27:08,600 --> 02:27:11,720
I guess this would be good for Yeti armor!

2095
02:27:12,740 --> 02:27:13,420
Jeez!

2096
02:27:15,960 --> 02:27:16,460
You two!

2097
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:17,320
Two of them!

2098
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:18,100
Wait, oh shoot.

2099
02:27:19,920 --> 02:27:20,380
Wait.

2100
02:27:28,540 --> 02:27:29,240
Oh my gosh.

2101
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:30,400
I'm stupid.

2102
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:32,500
My stamina.

2103
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:39,080
When did you guys get so strong?

2104
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:42,100
Ugh.

2105
02:27:43,260 --> 02:27:44,040
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

2106
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:46,640
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

2107
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:51,420
When did they get so strong?

2108
02:27:52,920 --> 02:27:53,380
Ugh.

2109
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:58,660
Things just crying over there by itself.

2110
02:27:59,020 --> 02:27:59,400
What's this?

2111
02:27:59,500 --> 02:27:59,980
Yo-Kan!

2112
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:03,000
Hmm.

2113
02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:10,230
Anything else?

2114
02:28:10,610 --> 02:28:11,110
Whoa!

2115
02:28:11,550 --> 02:28:14,650
These environments are so cool, though.

2116
02:28:16,210 --> 02:28:18,330
It's one thing this game really does right.

2117
02:28:18,590 --> 02:28:19,330
It's just...

2118
02:28:20,290 --> 02:28:23,270
A really cool environment.

2119
02:28:23,530 --> 02:28:25,670
The setting is so awesome.

2120
02:28:26,910 --> 02:28:27,370
What's this?

2121
02:28:27,850 --> 02:28:28,830
Oh, Aburagi.

2122
02:28:34,330 --> 02:28:41,950
There was a fox shrine I went to Once I had like all the foxes everywhere You know

2123
02:28:45,010 --> 02:29:24,790

2125
02:29:41,650 --> 02:29:44,190
I just tried to crawl away from me.

2126
02:29:44,730 --> 02:29:45,770
I just...

2127
02:29:45,770 --> 02:29:48,010
I tried to crawl away.

2128
02:29:48,110 --> 02:29:50,190
I was like, wait, wait, wait, please.

2129
02:29:53,790 --> 02:29:55,830
I just went Yeti mode on it.

2130
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:57,210
Ducky, thanks for the captain!

2131
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:08,670
Do they fear me now?

2132
02:30:11,090 --> 02:30:12,370
Because I...

2133
02:30:12,370 --> 02:30:13,170
Have the brooch.

2134
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:19,860
Oh, uh...

2135
02:30:19,860 --> 02:30:21,660
How do I do the Yeti Vision?

2136
02:30:23,160 --> 02:30:23,920
Wait, ah.

2137
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,160
Hold on, I need to... Oh, not map.

2138
02:30:26,460 --> 02:30:26,460
Sorry.

2139
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:28,240
I need to go to my tutorials.

2140
02:30:30,120 --> 02:30:30,960
Yeti Vision.

2141
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:35,420
L2?

2142
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:38,200
Ah, thank you.

2143
02:30:41,240 --> 02:30:42,180
Thank you, thank you.

2144
02:30:44,480 --> 02:30:45,020
though.

2145
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:47,590
What was in here?

2146
02:30:56,840 --> 02:30:58,300
Black Sparrow Crest.

2147
02:30:58,740 --> 02:30:59,980
Ah, a badge with something carved.

2148
02:31:00,440 --> 02:31:01,760
Onto it looks like a black sparrow.

2149
02:31:04,440 --> 02:31:08,100
Oh look, it shows you like that it's in there.

2150
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:08,790
That's kind of fun.

2151
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:12,820
Codenya, thank you for the gifted!

2152
02:31:13,420 --> 02:31:14,280
Housemaids note.

2153
02:31:14,920 --> 02:31:22,760
Surely after I became their maid, there was of an arranged marriage for the young heir to a noble woman.

2154
02:31:23,420 --> 02:31:39,160
This led to their heir unceremoniously ending all his scandalous relationships with women, including one with a young housemaid named Sachi Sachi came from a family of poor farmers, but her beauty shone brighter than the sun.

2155
02:31:39,900 --> 02:31:40,760
I'm so sorry.

2156
02:31:41,640 --> 02:31:43,960
Something that had caught the young heir's eye.

2157
02:31:44,480 --> 02:31:54,180
By the time his marriage was being arranged, she already had a life-growing inside of her, and the two had made vows to run away and start a new life together.

2158
02:31:56,480 --> 02:31:56,960
Scandalous!

2159
02:31:58,240 --> 02:32:01,960
And yet the young heir cruelly and wantonly cast her aside.

2160
02:32:02,420 --> 02:32:05,740
Likely, he simply did not want his prospective marriage to be ruined.

2161
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:15,400
So the Tsunekis kicked Satie out and drove her to some far-off place where they could forget her existence, despite the peace of the family she carried with her.

2162
02:32:15,900 --> 02:32:21,200
People say that she was fighting back tears so hard that blood began to trickle from her eyes.

2163
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:23,340
Oh my gosh.

2164
02:32:26,700 --> 02:32:27,580
So metal.

2165
02:32:36,860 --> 02:32:36,880
Cool.

2166
02:32:40,200 --> 02:32:41,340
Saving, thank you.

2167
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:42,880
Ah, okay.

2168
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:46,460
Can I put it anywhere or?

2169
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:48,140
Um.

2170
02:32:56,300 --> 02:32:56,900
Oh.

2171
02:32:59,180 --> 02:33:00,020
Uh.

2172
02:33:02,400 --> 02:33:02,880
Okay.

2173
02:33:03,360 --> 02:33:03,620
Hmm.

2174
02:33:07,370 --> 02:33:08,210
This clue, right?

2175
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:10,190
Prove your intent with the crest three.

2176
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:11,710
Show what lies deep within your heart.

2177
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:13,410
Let the line of foxes guide you.

2178
02:33:14,250 --> 02:33:16,210
Offer the crest and lay bare your soul.

2179
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:29,370
Sorry, I didn't read that one out loud.

2180
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:34,000
Okay.

2181
02:33:38,720 --> 02:33:39,200
Um...

2182
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:40,760
Do I just go...

2183
02:33:41,840 --> 02:33:43,640
I think I went this way.

2184
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:45,840
Is it... Okay, I can...

2185
02:33:47,800 --> 02:33:49,880
Follow the line of foxes.

2186
02:33:56,180 --> 02:33:59,500
So maybe I can only put it in ones that are facing forward.

2187
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:02,000
So it'll be one...

2188
02:34:03,020 --> 02:34:04,820
There's so many holes though!

2189
02:34:05,480 --> 02:34:05,800
Huh?

2190
02:34:06,420 --> 02:34:06,820
Wait.

2191
02:34:07,340 --> 02:34:08,440
There's so many.

2192
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:12,100
Like this guy's facing behind, you know.

2193
02:34:12,340 --> 02:34:13,660
This guy's facing behind.

2194
02:34:13,820 --> 02:34:15,080
And this guy's facing behind.

2195
02:34:20,910 --> 02:34:22,190
check the other doors

2196
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:43,700
oh my gosh since I woke up I've been so fleming like my throat doesn't hurt but I just like all day I've been having to be like you know I don't know why so much ectoplasm

2197
02:34:47,150 --> 02:35:57,410
the Tineki oh housemaids note the Tinekis are the most notable family in this area and are known for their wealth for generations each head of the family has possessed a talent for business an acumen they have utilized during times of social unrest to amass a large fortune you've been getting that so bad yeah it sucks too much boogers it probably is seasonal changes it's so cold you guys it's so stinking cold recently it's hard to get it was almost so hard to get out of morning i was like i'm gonna freeze i'm gonna be gonna become a acto sickle however given that a great many suffered while they grew rich their actions have often drawn envious eyes healthy throat through healthy throat beave thank you when i first entered into service with the tzuneckis my grandmother shared some of the many rumors that swirl around the family each time the world falls to pieces the tzuneckis treasury only grows larger the But Seneckis are happily waiting for misfortunes to strike so they can line

2198
02:35:57,410 --> 02:35:58,310
their pockets.

2199
02:35:58,710 --> 02:35:59,190
Yikes.

2200
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:01,950
Great bunch.

2201
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:10,580
Nasty.

2202
02:36:12,180 --> 02:36:13,560
Oh, there we go.

2203
02:36:14,580 --> 02:36:15,740
Divine water.

2204
02:36:17,680 --> 02:36:18,380
Gulp, gulp, gulp.

2205
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:22,640
Which way do I go?

2206
02:36:24,120 --> 02:36:24,820
Oh, well.

2207
02:36:25,940 --> 02:36:26,360
Commit.

2208
02:36:27,620 --> 02:36:29,040
Strict mother's letter.

2209
02:36:29,720 --> 02:36:30,440
Oh, yeah!

2210
02:36:31,020 --> 02:36:32,460
Good morning, my handsome boy.

2211
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:37,460
Your real last name is Tsuneki.

2212
02:36:38,240 --> 02:36:42,880
It is told that those of the Tsuneki lineage are destined to bring good fortune when the world is in disorder.

2213
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:46,940
In fact, that is how your father earned succession to the Tsuneki lineage.

2214
02:36:47,540 --> 02:36:51,820
And you who have inherited your father's noble blood are sure to be next in line.

2215
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:54,760
Wait, is this the lady that got cast aside?

2216
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:59,700
To make your name, I took one character from your father's name and one from mine.

2217
02:36:59,720 --> 02:37:05,360
That way, when anyone from the Toneki family hears your name, they will immediately know you are our child.

2218
02:37:09,740 --> 02:37:11,060
Oh, thank you.

2219
02:37:12,520 --> 02:37:14,700
They got me anything for me.

2220
02:37:22,170 --> 02:37:22,890
Thank you.

2221
02:37:24,290 --> 02:37:25,510
There was one here.

2222
02:37:26,850 --> 02:37:27,590
And one in the middle.

2223
02:37:29,650 --> 02:37:31,070
Hey, you got something in your mouth?

2224
02:37:32,250 --> 02:37:32,810
Spit it out.

2225
02:37:32,950 --> 02:37:33,510
Spit it out.

2226
02:37:36,070 --> 02:37:37,810
Wait, what door did I come in from?

2227
02:37:37,930 --> 02:37:40,270
This is why I wish I could have access to the map.

2228
02:37:41,050 --> 02:37:42,330
Wait, I'm, like, actually lost.

2229
02:37:42,630 --> 02:37:43,770
Where did I come in from?

2230
02:37:45,750 --> 02:37:46,610
Over there?

2231
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:55,400
I think there, because the letter was here.

2232
02:37:58,180 --> 02:37:59,320
Oh my gosh, please.

2233
02:38:00,260 --> 02:38:02,300
I feel like I'm going to get lost in here.

2234
02:38:04,100 --> 02:38:04,660
Hi, lost.

2235
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:05,420
I'm Wisp.

2236
02:38:06,720 --> 02:38:07,160
Wisp!

2237
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:13,420
Oh, oh, oh, what is that?

2238
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:14,420
It sounds big.

2239
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:17,340
Oh, oh.

2240
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:20,260
There's two of them.

2241
02:38:29,550 --> 02:38:30,690
Whoa, whoa.

2242
02:38:33,750 --> 02:38:40,070
What is going on in here?

2243
02:38:43,940 --> 02:38:45,300
Torture room?

2244
02:38:46,100 --> 02:38:46,440
Maybe.

2245
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:49,140
Yeah.

2246
02:38:51,160 --> 02:38:51,700
Oh my god.

2247
02:38:51,960 --> 02:38:52,360
It's you.

2248
02:38:54,260 --> 02:38:54,700
Touch.

2249
02:38:55,700 --> 02:38:56,120
Ah!

2250
02:38:56,300 --> 02:38:56,960
There's two of them!

2251
02:38:58,660 --> 02:38:59,300
Oh my gosh.

2252
02:38:59,480 --> 02:38:59,900
Oh my gosh.

2253
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:02,240
I thought you guys were supposed to be scared of me.

2254
02:39:04,300 --> 02:39:04,540
Dodge.

2255
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:05,020
Oh gosh.

2256
02:39:05,160 --> 02:39:05,360
Ouch.

2257
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:07,640
Ouch.

2258
02:39:08,100 --> 02:39:08,540
Ouch.

2259
02:39:08,540 --> 02:39:08,600
Dodge.

2260
02:39:13,930 --> 02:39:14,370
Ah!

2261
02:39:14,830 --> 02:39:15,210
Ouch.

2262
02:39:17,410 --> 02:39:17,550
Ouch.

2263
02:39:17,550 --> 02:39:17,650
Wait.

2264
02:39:17,790 --> 02:39:18,350
I can't move.

2265
02:39:18,490 --> 02:39:18,810
I'm stuck.

2266
02:39:19,950 --> 02:39:20,430
I'm stuck.

2267
02:39:20,890 --> 02:39:53,010
this sucks dodge oh my god one's running at me one is running at me they're both running at me oh I got them somehow holy moly oh geez oh camera please I was just anything please that was crazy got that strong hand Thank goodness, right?

2268
02:39:56,370 --> 02:39:56,770
Nasty.

2269
02:39:57,170 --> 02:39:58,070
Nasty fellas.

2270
02:40:00,290 --> 02:40:02,170
I feel like I shouldn't have come in here.

2271
02:40:04,030 --> 02:40:06,530
I feel like maybe I made a mistake on which door I went through.

2272
02:40:10,890 --> 02:40:12,570
Is there anything in here?

2273
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:22,350
So the way this section works is whenever you pick the wrong door, you get sent here again and have to fight.

2274
02:40:24,470 --> 02:40:26,130
Oh, I see.

2275
02:40:26,290 --> 02:40:27,150
Thank you.

2276
02:40:27,550 --> 02:40:29,110
It's just a trap room.

2277
02:40:30,630 --> 02:40:30,970
Horrible.

2278
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:32,070
Wait.

2279
02:40:35,710 --> 02:40:38,030
How am I supposed to know which door is correct?

2280
02:40:43,430 --> 02:40:48,050
Which one is correct?

2281
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:51,830
Okay.

2282
02:40:52,850 --> 02:40:56,630
This blood splatter is wrong.

2283
02:41:11,980 --> 02:41:14,240
Let the fox guide you.

2284
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:29,720
So he is very distinctly staring at the door.

2285
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:32,420
The other guys...

2286
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:33,980
Yeah, I think it's this one.

2287
02:41:34,100 --> 02:41:35,720
The other guys are kind of like looking...

2288
02:41:35,720 --> 02:41:36,620
Well, this guy's also...

2289
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:38,220
Well, maybe he's looking at this blood.

2290
02:41:38,560 --> 02:41:39,000
I don't know.

2291
02:41:40,540 --> 02:41:41,220
I'll try.

2292
02:41:43,780 --> 02:41:44,620
Use concentration?

2293
02:41:45,060 --> 02:41:46,060
Oh, wait, that's wrong thing.

2294
02:41:49,180 --> 02:41:50,160
Wait, what was it?

2295
02:41:54,040 --> 02:41:54,480
No?

2296
02:41:54,740 --> 02:41:55,500
Or is it?

2297
02:42:00,050 --> 02:42:02,130
One of the foxes has something stabbed in it.

2298
02:42:02,310 --> 02:42:03,970
Wait, did I not get that?

2299
02:42:05,810 --> 02:42:07,270
Oh, wait, I think I get it.

2300
02:42:07,310 --> 02:42:08,010
Oh, okay, wait.

2301
02:42:09,270 --> 02:42:09,690
No.

2302
02:42:10,330 --> 02:42:11,690
Because it turned before.

2303
02:42:13,630 --> 02:42:15,050
And like its eyes shone.

2304
02:42:16,710 --> 02:42:18,770
But nothing had it stabbed this time.

2305
02:42:25,860 --> 02:42:27,080
Try staring at the floor.

2306
02:42:35,450 --> 02:42:35,850
Whoa!

2307
02:42:45,580 --> 02:42:46,840
This one too!

2308
02:42:51,770 --> 02:42:53,370
Oh my god.

2309
02:42:56,090 --> 02:42:56,990
You got anything?

2310
02:42:59,550 --> 02:43:00,670
Nothing up your butt?

2311
02:43:04,330 --> 02:43:06,390
Oh wait, I see it, I see it.

2312
02:43:07,770 --> 02:43:08,070
That.

2313
02:43:09,230 --> 02:43:09,930
Grab it.

2314
02:43:10,110 --> 02:43:10,350
Oh wait.

2315
02:43:10,970 --> 02:43:11,970
Examine, grab it.

2316
02:43:14,350 --> 02:43:16,230
I would have never figured that out.

2317
02:43:18,810 --> 02:43:22,630
Perish once and for all, Shimizu Hinako shall disappear today.

2318
02:43:23,430 --> 02:43:25,050
Oh, okay.

2319
02:43:33,950 --> 02:43:37,530
So it's this way then, because he's...

2320
02:43:38,310 --> 02:43:38,810
Uh-huh.

2321
02:43:40,930 --> 02:43:41,250
Oh.

2322
02:43:41,810 --> 02:43:42,570
Oh, geez.

2323
02:43:43,770 --> 02:43:44,450
Oh, cheese.

2324
02:43:45,930 --> 02:43:47,290
Oh, cheese.

2325
02:43:53,650 --> 02:43:55,650
I don't know

2326
02:44:25,720 --> 02:44:27,960
where it last picked up.

2327
02:44:28,220 --> 02:44:29,240
Oh, okay, right here.

2328
02:44:32,980 --> 02:44:35,360
Can I, like, leave?

2329
02:44:38,860 --> 02:44:41,040
What if I just ignore him?

2330
02:44:43,240 --> 02:44:44,140
Oh, shoot.

2331
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:45,560
Okay, I don't like that.

2332
02:44:47,880 --> 02:44:49,040
I don't like you guys either.

2333
02:44:51,220 --> 02:44:51,700
What the?

2334
02:44:51,800 --> 02:44:53,660
You can't dodge my attack?

2335
02:44:58,790 --> 02:44:59,910
Wait, is he in here?

2336
02:45:03,070 --> 02:45:04,150
Oh, yes he is.

2337
02:45:04,410 --> 02:45:05,150
Wait, I need her.

2338
02:45:05,570 --> 02:45:06,370
Wait, I need her.

2339
02:45:07,890 --> 02:45:08,170
No.

2340
02:45:08,730 --> 02:45:10,130
Let me have her, please.

2341
02:45:13,190 --> 02:45:13,490
Ah!

2342
02:45:13,710 --> 02:45:14,610
Where did you come from?

2343
02:45:15,530 --> 02:45:15,830
No!

2344
02:45:23,740 --> 02:45:24,120
Please.

2345
02:45:24,540 --> 02:45:24,940
Dodge.

2346
02:45:25,460 --> 02:45:26,060
There's something.

2347
02:45:29,240 --> 02:45:30,700
She's back alive already!

2348
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:31,240
Evil.

2349
02:45:31,320 --> 02:45:32,320
Oh, this is so evil.

2350
02:45:32,600 --> 02:45:33,360
Wait, this is really evil.

2351
02:45:33,440 --> 02:45:34,560
Oh my god.

2352
02:45:36,980 --> 02:45:38,260
Oh my god, this sucks.

2353
02:45:38,480 --> 02:45:39,360
Wait, guys, this sucks.

2354
02:45:40,060 --> 02:45:40,600
Oh, this sucks.

2355
02:45:46,110 --> 02:45:46,950
I need you.

2356
02:45:48,730 --> 02:45:51,270
Oh my god, I need to soul siphon you, but I can't!

2357
02:45:52,410 --> 02:45:53,830
You're just gonna wake up again!

2358
02:45:59,290 --> 02:46:00,250
No, I'm ready!

2359
02:46:01,430 --> 02:46:02,870
Wait, I'm trying to...

2360
02:46:02,870 --> 02:46:04,810
Wait, how do I pull my devil trigger?

2361
02:46:07,570 --> 02:46:08,570
Um, hold on.

2362
02:46:09,390 --> 02:46:12,170
I thought it was L3, but it's not working.

2363
02:46:15,370 --> 02:46:20,230
Oh, it's both sticks!

2364
02:46:21,830 --> 02:46:21,890
Yeah!

2365
02:46:26,910 --> 02:46:27,130
Yeah!

2366
02:46:28,710 --> 02:46:29,130
Yeah!

2367
02:46:30,970 --> 02:46:31,190
Yeah!

2368
02:46:31,950 --> 02:46:32,050
Yeah!

2369
02:46:37,830 --> 02:46:38,370
You done?

2370
02:46:40,190 --> 02:46:40,650
Okay.

2371
02:46:41,250 --> 02:46:41,370
Oh.

2372
02:46:42,310 --> 02:46:42,710
What about...

2373
02:46:42,710 --> 02:46:43,090
Oh, okay.

2374
02:46:43,230 --> 02:46:43,670
That's right.

2375
02:46:43,710 --> 02:46:47,590
When I kill them, when I'm Devil Trigger, they...

2376
02:46:47,590 --> 02:46:49,670
they disappear already.

2377
02:46:49,930 --> 02:46:50,970
They disappear forever.

2378
02:46:51,390 --> 02:46:51,690
Yay!

2379
02:46:52,850 --> 02:46:54,610
Okay, anything else around here?

2380
02:46:57,490 --> 02:46:58,670
Holy moly.

2381
02:46:59,710 --> 02:47:00,910
Yeah, auto siphons.

2382
02:47:01,230 --> 02:47:01,750
Yeah, yeah.

2383
02:47:03,610 --> 02:47:05,350
I hear her in there.

2384
02:47:07,310 --> 02:47:10,410
Maybe I'm just gonna take her out so that we can...

2385
02:47:11,410 --> 02:47:12,010
Oh, whoops.

2386
02:47:12,650 --> 02:47:15,410
So that we can get more soul siphon.

2387
02:47:17,490 --> 02:47:19,010
Yeah, yeah.

2388
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:31,140
Take her out to dinner?

2389
02:47:33,460 --> 02:47:34,160
She wishes.

2390
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:40,140
She wishes she could even get a stroke of this Yeti arm.

2391
02:47:41,880 --> 02:47:42,960
Amito getting cocky?

2392
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:45,340
No, not at all.

2393
02:47:47,280 --> 02:47:48,740
I just died.

2394
02:47:48,840 --> 02:47:50,560
Why would I be getting cocky?

2395
02:47:51,300 --> 02:47:54,300
I just, I literally just died in this room before.

2396
02:47:57,260 --> 02:48:02,940
Sure, when I have a Yeti trigger, it makes me feel a little better, but...

2397
02:48:02,940 --> 02:48:03,740
Cocky?

2398
02:48:08,970 --> 02:48:13,970
Like, I think what it is about the arm is it just reminds me so much of a dog I used to have.

2399
02:48:14,110 --> 02:48:17,190
And my mom would be like, oh, he's not ugly.

2400
02:48:17,370 --> 02:48:19,070
His hair is just wiry.

2401
02:48:20,030 --> 02:48:22,090
I'm such an ugly dog.

2402
02:48:22,810 --> 02:48:24,210
Oh, white sparrow crest.

2403
02:48:26,110 --> 02:48:26,770
the light sparrow.

2404
02:48:31,580 --> 02:48:32,540
What kind of dog did you have?

2405
02:48:32,640 --> 02:48:33,180
I don't remember.

2406
02:48:33,280 --> 02:48:36,340
It was like, it was my mom's dog.

2407
02:48:36,880 --> 02:48:38,620
She was like so into this dog.

2408
02:48:39,720 --> 02:48:41,020
But I think, how?

2409
02:48:42,460 --> 02:48:44,140
Lopsa opsa something?

2410
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:45,000
I don't know.

2411
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:45,800
I don't remember.

2412
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:55,840
It was ugly and it had an underbite and it like would go up to you and be like, but it wasn't a pug.

2413
02:48:56,040 --> 02:48:57,040
It just did that.

2414
02:49:01,810 --> 02:49:03,650
I don't know what it was

2415
02:49:10,020 --> 02:49:49,520
ugly my dad would always be like why did you bring that thing home it just felt so bad for him and then my grandma would feed him food that he couldn't eat and so we would just like fart all the time like he had he was very sweet he just had no redeeming qualities like you know like he just had a lot of things against him yeah i was pretty cursed i think uh i got let's just give the divine water uh the abra again oh here we go we have a lot of stuff actually that i can let's do the kazu

2416
02:49:54,940 --> 02:50:07,140
and um i will pray for oh wow i already did all the omamori slots that's awesome I think I'll still do more health.

2417
02:50:09,240 --> 02:50:12,980
Even though I've been running out of stamina so quickly lately.

2418
02:50:15,540 --> 02:50:17,320
Very sweet, but not very good looking.

2419
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:18,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2420
02:50:26,700 --> 02:50:28,620
You want it for the final boss.

2421
02:50:28,740 --> 02:50:29,320
Wait, want what?

2422
02:50:29,380 --> 02:50:29,800
The health?

2423
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:33,260
Yeah, enemies are doing beefy damage.

2424
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:34,100
That's true.

2425
02:50:34,360 --> 02:50:35,280
I think I'll go with...

2426
02:50:37,240 --> 02:50:39,080
You now have more holes.

2427
02:50:39,600 --> 02:50:40,360
We could always get more.

2428
02:50:40,440 --> 02:50:41,200
Well, I don't have an Emma.

2429
02:50:41,340 --> 02:50:41,980
We could!

2430
02:50:42,280 --> 02:50:42,700
Hold on.

2431
02:50:43,320 --> 02:50:43,640
Save.

2432
02:50:44,620 --> 02:50:45,320
We're gonna save.

2433
02:50:46,180 --> 02:50:48,520
And we're gonna draw.

2434
02:50:51,240 --> 02:50:54,800
Omamori Sakura enhances the effects of health restoring items and...

2435
02:50:54,800 --> 02:50:58,200
Oh wait, health restoring items and omamoris.

2436
02:50:58,980 --> 02:51:01,100
What do I...

2437
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:07,040
Do I have any health Omamori.

2438
02:51:09,640 --> 02:51:13,900
Sorry, it's so funny.

2439
02:51:15,300 --> 02:51:17,180
Slightly restores health after defeating an enemy.

2440
02:51:18,940 --> 02:51:21,020
Greatly decreases focus charging.

2441
02:51:22,020 --> 02:51:22,740
Max stamina.

2442
02:51:27,820 --> 02:51:30,280
So yeah, I do.

2443
02:51:37,440 --> 02:51:38,880
Crow plus Sakura.

2444
02:51:39,080 --> 02:52:00,680
you hoard health items because you never use i use oh oh i i thought you meant like you wouldn't use them oh that's fair that's fair you would just keep collecting them and never have to use them but i feel like in the final boss battle you would probably have to use them because i mean like unless he summons other things you know which he probably will whatever the boss is

2445
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:22,220
I'll think about it I'll still keep it though I think that was pretty good Okay Which one have I not gone into

2446
02:52:26,610 --> 02:52:34,410
Ew More emblems Did I go through this door?

2447
02:52:35,370 --> 02:52:41,010
Yes So I go through this door Let me just get them first, and then I'll...

2448
02:52:44,830 --> 02:52:47,390
Let me just get them first, and then I will...

2449
02:52:47,390 --> 02:52:49,190
Oh my goodness, there's so many!

2450
02:52:54,840 --> 02:52:58,320
Then I'll decide where to put them, I'll figure it out.

2451
02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:00,580
Amblums, emblems!

2452
02:53:00,700 --> 02:53:01,880
We need more emblems!

2453
02:53:03,780 --> 02:53:04,580
Amblums, emblems!

2454
02:53:04,620 --> 02:53:06,200
We need more emblems!

2455
02:53:06,920 --> 02:53:07,360
Oh, hello?

2456
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:10,100
Goodbye, motor, thank you.

2457
02:53:15,020 --> 02:53:16,220
In deed.

2458
02:53:18,660 --> 02:53:19,260
You?

2459
02:53:24,630 --> 02:53:26,990
Oh, we found it.

2460
02:53:27,070 --> 02:53:27,670
That was fast.

2461
02:53:28,870 --> 02:53:31,730
Oh, I keep forgetting I have to do the examine.

2462
02:53:36,450 --> 02:53:41,490
Ornate scroll, sacrifice once and for all, body and soul, made pure by rebirth.

2463
02:53:41,890 --> 02:53:42,730
Awful, awful.

2464
02:53:46,150 --> 02:53:48,150
Offer all that is yours.

2465
02:53:55,870 --> 02:53:57,030
That door.

2466
02:53:57,890 --> 02:53:58,090
Got it.

2467
02:53:58,370 --> 02:53:58,790
Thank you.

2468
02:53:59,210 --> 02:53:59,730
Hold on.

2469
02:54:01,530 --> 02:54:04,770
I must acquire everything else that the fox offered to me.

2470
02:54:09,680 --> 02:54:11,780
You all are stingy.

2471
02:54:16,120 --> 02:54:18,040
What is this?

2472
02:54:19,520 --> 02:54:21,020
Strict mother's letter.

2473
02:54:22,100 --> 02:54:23,620
Good morning, handsome boy.

2474
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:24,880

2475
02:54:25,280 --> 02:54:27,760
Indeed, good news to a Tsuneki is always...

Oh, wait.

2479
02:55:04,980 --> 02:55:05,600
You're not easy.

2480
02:55:06,780 --> 02:55:06,900
Oh.

2481
02:55:10,100 --> 02:55:10,740
Do you have anything?

2482
02:55:12,400 --> 02:55:16,060
What did I waste my mind powers on you for?

2483
02:55:17,040 --> 02:55:18,140
Wait, what's going on here?

2484
02:55:20,480 --> 02:55:21,060
Whoa.

2485
02:55:22,340 --> 02:55:23,060

2486
02:55:24,460 --> 02:55:26,120
Good morning, handsome, Minto.

2487
02:55:26,500 --> 02:55:26,720

2489
02:55:32,060 --> 02:55:33,180
This one.

2490
02:55:38,860 --> 02:55:39,180
No!

2491
02:55:40,580 --> 02:55:41,140
Yes?

2492
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:42,460
Oh, yes.

2493
02:55:43,860 --> 02:55:45,100
I thought I was back.

2494
02:55:45,320 --> 02:55:45,520
Ah!

2495
02:55:52,140 --> 02:55:53,480
Um, oh, geez.

2496
02:56:02,060 --> 02:56:02,520
Oh, geez.

2497
02:56:04,740 --> 02:56:05,620
Ah, I owe each other.

2498
02:56:09,900 --> 02:56:11,020
Oh, my God.

2499
02:56:11,240 --> 02:56:11,920
Oh, my God.

2500
02:56:17,590 --> 02:56:18,870
Yeah, let's go.

2501
02:56:20,230 --> 02:56:20,850
Oh, God.

2502
02:56:20,870 --> 02:56:22,050
There's a big guy!

2503
02:56:25,780 --> 02:56:26,240
Oh my gosh!

2504
02:56:26,600 --> 02:56:26,920
Oh my gosh!

2505
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:27,780
I'm getting my ass!

2506
02:56:27,980 --> 02:56:29,580
My ass handed to me!

2507
02:56:29,740 --> 02:56:30,360
Not my ass!

2508
02:56:30,740 --> 02:56:31,380
Oh my ass!

2509
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:34,140
Oh my gosh!

2510
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:41,400
Moli!

2511
02:56:41,400 --> 02:56:42,660
This is insanity!

2512
02:56:55,850 --> 02:56:57,350
Wait, did I...

2513
02:56:57,350 --> 02:56:58,450
Oh my gosh, no please!

2514
02:57:01,150 --> 02:57:03,170
I wanted to see if there was a siphon, yes.

2515
02:57:05,030 --> 02:57:06,810
You asshole, please!

2516
02:57:09,470 --> 02:57:09,930
Okay.

2517
02:57:12,210 --> 02:57:13,310
Oh my gosh.

2518
02:57:21,110 --> 02:57:24,090
Oh my god, I'm gonna freaking make lose it.

2519
02:57:27,710 --> 02:57:28,270
Okay.

2520
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:31,550
Soul Siphon, Soul Siphon.

2521
02:57:32,350 --> 02:57:32,550
Please.

2522
02:57:41,380 --> 02:57:43,860
I just need the Soul Siphon you please!

2523
02:57:44,680 --> 02:57:44,880
Okay.

2524
02:57:45,660 --> 02:57:46,660
So he doesn't come back.

2525
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:48,420
Oh wait.

2526
02:57:50,500 --> 02:57:51,060
Yeah!

2527
02:57:52,000 --> 02:57:52,400
Yeah!

2528
02:57:53,260 --> 02:57:53,720
Yeah!

2529
02:57:54,680 --> 02:57:55,180
Yeah!

2530
02:57:58,200 --> 02:57:59,660
Oh, it's okay.

2531
02:58:00,140 --> 02:58:00,560
It's okay.

2532
02:58:00,720 --> 02:58:01,440
It doesn't hurt me.

2533
02:58:01,960 --> 02:58:02,560
I don't care.

2534
02:58:04,100 --> 02:58:05,300
I'm in beast mode.

2535
02:58:07,180 --> 02:58:07,520
Yeah.

2536
02:58:08,160 --> 02:58:08,940
Take that.

2537
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:09,900
Take that.

2538
02:58:15,760 --> 02:58:16,760
Oh my gosh.

2539
02:58:20,100 --> 02:58:21,920
Oh my gosh.

2540
02:58:27,730 --> 02:58:29,170
I can't even read what it says.

2541
02:58:29,830 --> 02:58:31,230
Oh my gosh.

2542
02:58:31,450 --> 02:58:40,010
Not that, you know, I might not be able to read it because, you know, kanji, but I try.

2543
02:58:43,210 --> 02:58:44,510
Oh, it's so scary!

2544
02:58:46,790 --> 02:58:47,430
Oh, forsaken!

2545
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:48,030
Okay.

2546
02:58:51,070 --> 02:58:53,510
All right, let's get out of this crazy room.

2547
02:58:58,090 --> 02:58:59,710
Oh, where have you been?

2548
02:58:59,890 --> 02:59:00,410
Oh, Juko!

2549
02:59:06,950 --> 02:59:15,030
my sister way to pull your yedi trigger thank you i only know kanji for one two and three

2550
02:59:22,020 --> 02:59:34,000
yeah does she mean

2551
02:59:37,760 --> 02:59:58,760
Oh, you gave us like two seconds, my goodness.

2552
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:00,140
No.

2553
03:00:02,520 --> 03:00:03,240
Oh, you gave us like two seconds, my goodness.

2554
03:00:05,920 --> 03:00:07,960
Why does Junko not have a fox mask?

2555
03:00:08,120 --> 03:00:08,680
So interesting.

2556
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,920
Big Mac, thank you so much for the five guesses.

2557
03:00:25,120 --> 03:00:26,460
Married to the Tengu family?

2558
03:00:26,860 --> 03:00:27,860
No, I don't think it's a Tengu.

2559
03:00:28,080 --> 03:00:29,420
Tengu has like a long nose.

2560
03:00:36,100 --> 03:00:37,700
Married to another family.

2561
03:00:40,580 --> 03:00:42,000
It is a Tengu!

2562
03:00:42,880 --> 03:00:44,080
It looks so strange though.

2563
03:00:47,160 --> 03:00:48,380
Leave the room.

2564
03:00:49,460 --> 03:00:49,780
Okay.

2565
03:00:50,160 --> 03:00:50,420
Okay.

2566
03:00:50,900 --> 03:00:51,380
Hmm,

2567
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:02,220
hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

2568
03:01:03,580 --> 03:01:04,340
You thought crow.

2569
03:01:04,440 --> 03:01:05,120
I thought so, too.

2570
03:01:05,180 --> 03:01:07,020
I thought it looked like a kind of crow-like.

2571
03:01:08,360 --> 03:01:09,700
I just want to see the paintings.

2572
03:01:12,100 --> 03:01:12,560
This one.

2573
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:13,300
It's cool.

2574
03:01:14,740 --> 03:01:15,140
Whoa.

2575
03:01:20,360 --> 03:01:20,840
Whoa.

2576
03:01:23,920 --> 03:01:52,440
okay so okay i don't know why i thought it said solve the marital status i was like huh because she's married okay this one i'm actually a bit stumped on black bird wishes to take the white bird the white bird wishes to resist.

2577
03:01:53,400 --> 03:01:55,700
The fox brings along his followers in triumph.

2578
03:01:56,460 --> 03:01:59,340
He notices not the two birds in conflict.

2579
03:02:03,040 --> 03:02:04,800
So the white bird is resisting.

2580
03:02:05,020 --> 03:02:06,220
The black bird wants to go.

2581
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:28,740
It's a lot of holes.

2582
03:02:29,480 --> 03:02:31,120
That's why it's kind of difficult.

2583
03:02:33,820 --> 03:02:35,560
Take a good look at all the fox guys.

2584
03:02:50,560 --> 03:03:09,700
Some of them are looking it seems like that this one looks like he's looking at his lamp so I feel like it's not that because he's he doesn't need to notice right alright but I overthinking it I can't tell

2585
03:03:17,180 --> 03:03:30,560
you have three coins and three foxes facing the other way but no He's supposed to be leading them, right?

2586
03:03:38,040 --> 03:03:39,880
This feels like maybe the fox.

2587
03:03:42,140 --> 03:03:43,040
More emblems.

2588
03:03:44,720 --> 03:03:46,740
And then maybe the one turned away.

2589
03:03:47,780 --> 03:03:50,560
See, like, this guy here is looking at the lamp.

2590
03:03:52,860 --> 03:03:53,980
This guy's looking away.

2591
03:03:55,220 --> 03:03:56,740
Maybe this is the white bird.

2592
03:04:07,590 --> 03:04:09,310
This is the black bird.

2593
03:04:15,770 --> 03:04:21,950
Basically the thing about conflict is what screwed me up because honestly none of them looked like they were fighting me but I guess they were.

2594
03:04:22,310 --> 03:04:23,430
Oh, they are?

2595
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:24,630
Huh?

2596
03:04:24,870 --> 03:04:25,490
Wait, hmm?

2597
03:04:31,570 --> 03:04:32,090
They are?

2598
03:04:34,550 --> 03:04:35,350
They're fighting?

2599
03:04:35,990 --> 03:04:36,770
The girls are fighting?

2600
03:04:38,470 --> 03:04:39,850
Two of them are fighting?

2601
03:04:40,450 --> 03:04:40,850
They are?

2602
03:04:44,750 --> 03:04:46,770
Um, this guy looks angry.

2603
03:04:46,890 --> 03:04:48,070
They all look angry.

2604
03:04:49,250 --> 03:04:50,850
This guy's smiling.

2605
03:04:50,990 --> 03:04:54,730
He's the only one that is, like, chip, chip, chippery.

2606
03:04:55,830 --> 03:04:59,250
Maybe he is the one that has the fox crest, then.

2607
03:05:01,170 --> 03:05:02,110
He's happy.

2608
03:05:02,870 --> 03:05:04,130
The girls are fighting.

2609
03:05:04,750 --> 03:05:06,050
This guy looks angry here.

2610
03:05:09,090 --> 03:05:10,110
Who's angry?

2611
03:05:10,810 --> 03:05:12,770
Can I not read social cues?

2612
03:05:16,110 --> 03:05:17,310
Can I...

2613
03:05:17,310 --> 03:05:20,570
Read it again?

2614
03:05:21,910 --> 03:05:24,350
The fox bringing along his followers in triumph.

2615
03:05:24,570 --> 03:05:26,250
You notice it's not the two bird in conflict.

2616
03:05:32,790 --> 03:05:34,550
New fear unlocked.

2617
03:05:34,850 --> 03:05:36,110
Like, this guy's just like chill.

2618
03:05:36,290 --> 03:05:37,070
He's just like, Yahoo!

2619
03:05:38,590 --> 03:05:40,030
I think he's happy.

2620
03:05:40,190 --> 03:05:41,190
He doesn't notice, right?

2621
03:05:41,770 --> 03:05:42,630
I don't know.

2622
03:05:43,530 --> 03:05:46,990
Unless he's supposed to be turned away from the two that are fighting.

2623
03:05:48,010 --> 03:05:48,530
Oh.

2624
03:05:53,630 --> 03:05:55,730
Who's... This guy looks angry too.

2625
03:05:56,710 --> 03:05:57,570
Are you fighting?

2626
03:05:59,450 --> 03:06:01,630
The two near the top look like they're fighting.

2627
03:06:01,830 --> 03:06:02,290
These two?

2628
03:06:13,560 --> 03:06:14,660
Oh wait, maybe actually...

2629
03:06:20,320 --> 03:06:21,360
Maybe like this.

2630
03:06:22,400 --> 03:06:23,500
Yeah, other way.

2631
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:38,160
Maybe then...

2632
03:06:38,160 --> 03:06:40,060
I was right the first time?

2633
03:06:40,360 --> 03:06:42,440
Just this dude being all happy.

2634
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:43,940
Oh!

2635
03:06:46,280 --> 03:06:47,680
Yippee yippee yippee!

2636
03:06:49,620 --> 03:06:51,360
Those guys were fighting.

2637
03:06:52,760 --> 03:06:55,140
Thank you guys for the hints.

2638
03:06:57,240 --> 03:06:57,620
Yahoo!

2639
03:07:11,010 --> 03:07:11,530
Oh.

2640
03:07:18,320 --> 03:07:19,360
Yes?

2641
03:07:25,580 --> 03:07:27,360
It's the only conflict in the...

2642
03:07:27,800 --> 03:07:29,020
Main thing, I guess that's true.

2643
03:07:29,980 --> 03:07:31,560
What is it?

2644
03:07:57,650 --> 03:07:59,190
Is that a ring?

2645
03:08:02,230 --> 03:08:03,630
Oh my gosh!

2646
03:08:03,950 --> 03:08:05,170
Are we making it official?

2647
03:08:13,560 --> 03:08:15,700
You guys are posting spoilers.

2648
03:08:16,780 --> 03:08:17,680
Uh, try not to.

2649
03:08:19,480 --> 03:08:20,440
Uh, but...

2650
03:08:20,440 --> 03:08:21,800
I'm also not looking so much.

2651
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:34,530
Oh my god.

2652
03:08:35,960 --> 03:08:36,320
Yeah.

2653
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:49,860
Wait!

2654
03:08:50,820 --> 03:08:53,340
I didn't make that sound!

2655
03:08:56,480 --> 03:09:01,140
Wait, that wasn't like a soundboard I- I-

2656
03:09:08,220 --> 03:09:11,430
Why did this the divine boom happen?

2657
03:09:21,870 --> 03:09:24,310
Why did that took me out entirely?

2658
03:09:24,510 --> 03:09:25,310
What just happened?

2659
03:09:31,650 --> 03:09:33,170
Oh my god, there's shoes.

2660
03:09:35,190 --> 03:09:36,530
Reduced to Adams.

2661
03:09:36,810 --> 03:09:37,710
Oh my gosh.

2662
03:09:52,050 --> 03:09:52,650
Uh-oh.

2663
03:09:53,970 --> 03:09:55,030
Oh, geez.

2664
03:09:55,250 --> 03:09:56,150
Oh my god.

2665
03:09:56,250 --> 03:09:57,370
Can't we get a break?

2666
03:10:05,500 --> 03:10:07,180
Yeah, go ape shit!

2667
03:10:30,010 --> 03:10:35,570
Said chase after the monster, but I don't know which...

2668
03:10:35,570 --> 03:10:35,570
Oh!

2669
03:10:37,550 --> 03:10:40,130
Oh, geez.

2670
03:10:43,010 --> 03:10:43,550
Oh my god.

2671
03:10:47,280 --> 03:10:48,760
This guy is so fast!

2672
03:10:51,300 --> 03:10:52,700
Uh-oh, where am I?

2673
03:10:53,420 --> 03:10:54,960
I'm about to lose my weapon.

2674
03:11:02,690 --> 03:11:04,710
Can I like run past?

2675
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:05,830
No, I can't.

2676
03:11:06,010 --> 03:11:06,590
Oh my gosh.

2677
03:11:06,930 --> 03:11:07,550
Of course not.

2678
03:11:09,250 --> 03:11:10,670
Oh, there's a baseball bat!

2679
03:11:13,470 --> 03:11:14,590
Ah, my weapon!

2680
03:11:15,990 --> 03:11:16,770
Oh geez.

2681
03:11:21,290 --> 03:11:22,990
My axe is also almost dead.

2682
03:11:25,730 --> 03:11:26,310
Oh geez.

2683
03:11:28,350 --> 03:11:29,190
Wait, I can't.

2684
03:11:29,310 --> 03:11:29,590
I can't.

2685
03:11:35,140 --> 03:11:38,220
Oh my gosh, please, let me out.

2686
03:11:46,610 --> 03:11:49,250
Is it still wanting me to chase?

2687
03:11:50,610 --> 03:11:51,630
I don't like it.

2688
03:11:51,670 --> 03:11:52,230
Oh, here.

2689
03:11:54,990 --> 03:11:56,050
Double hit.

2690
03:11:58,670 --> 03:12:00,870
Why are they phasing into each other?

2691
03:12:10,770 --> 03:12:12,050
Oh, I'm...

2692
03:12:12,050 --> 03:12:14,250
Oh, because of the... Oh my gosh, it sucks.

2693
03:12:33,240 --> 03:12:35,580
Oh, come on!

2694
03:12:40,130 --> 03:12:40,770
Yeah!

2695
03:12:44,970 --> 03:12:46,750
I'm just gonna take the other baseball bat.

2696
03:12:50,900 --> 03:12:51,980
Is there anything around here?

2697
03:12:52,160 --> 03:12:52,760
Red capsules.

2698
03:12:56,850 --> 03:12:58,050
Yeah, go Ape Shit!

2699
03:12:59,250 --> 03:12:59,890
Shimizu!

2700
03:13:00,630 --> 03:13:01,110
Hinako!

2701
03:13:05,050 --> 03:13:07,050
Oh, it just saved, but...

2702
03:13:09,920 --> 03:13:10,560
I'll pray.

2703
03:13:12,400 --> 03:13:13,660
Do I have anything to enshrine?

2704
03:13:14,180 --> 03:13:15,500
Oh, I do have Inari-zushi.

2705
03:13:17,720 --> 03:13:20,200
Um, I don't think we need to offer it right now, though.

2706
03:13:20,280 --> 03:13:21,580
Scarlet, thank you so much!

2707
03:13:21,680 --> 03:13:22,280
Welcome back!

2708
03:13:22,780 --> 03:13:23,400
There's an axe?

2709
03:13:23,500 --> 03:13:24,120
Wait, there was?

2710
03:13:24,440 --> 03:13:25,080
Oh, yes!

2711
03:13:25,660 --> 03:13:26,140
Thank you.

2712
03:13:27,980 --> 03:13:29,800
I don't even have enough for Gacha.

2713
03:13:32,420 --> 03:13:32,840
Oh!

2714
03:13:33,080 --> 03:13:33,480
Jesus!

2715
03:13:39,400 --> 03:13:41,220
Ah, you nasty!

2716
03:13:44,860 --> 03:13:45,380
Yeah!

2717
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:46,660
Take that!

2718
03:13:52,170 --> 03:13:52,670
What's this?

2719
03:13:53,470 --> 03:13:54,250
Oh, thank you.

2720
03:13:54,970 --> 03:13:56,750
I will offer this now, actually.

2721
03:13:58,130 --> 03:14:00,010
I like how this part has, like, the music.

2722
03:14:00,970 --> 03:14:02,130
That makes it seem like it's...

2723
03:14:02,130 --> 03:14:03,310
You're supposed to be, like...

2724
03:14:03,310 --> 03:14:05,150
You're fast pace.

2725
03:14:06,030 --> 03:14:08,710
But I'm, like, going at my own.

2726
03:14:09,930 --> 03:14:11,270
My own little pace.

2727
03:14:12,590 --> 03:14:13,670
Chase the fog monster.

2728
03:14:13,790 --> 03:14:14,030
Where'd it go?

2729
03:14:14,050 --> 03:14:17,190
Oh gosh, everything's red.

2730
03:14:18,490 --> 03:14:19,030
Everything's red.

2731
03:14:20,330 --> 03:14:20,330
What

2732
03:14:23,520 --> 03:14:25,420
does that sound?

2733
03:14:37,660 --> 03:14:37,780
Ah!

2734
03:14:38,340 --> 03:14:38,860
Oh, dang.

2735
03:15:00,870 --> 03:15:01,250
Whoa.

2736
03:15:02,070 --> 03:15:03,350
Home run, baby.

2737
03:15:04,110 --> 03:15:05,010
Another baseball bat.

2738
03:15:05,310 --> 03:15:06,850
They just keep getting me bats.

2739
03:15:11,100 --> 03:15:11,940
And a toolkit.

2740
03:15:13,000 --> 03:15:14,800
If only I had all my other weapons.

2741
03:15:15,040 --> 03:15:15,980
I think I like...

2742
03:15:15,980 --> 03:15:17,020
Wait, uh...

2743
03:15:18,160 --> 03:15:19,840
Yeah, I like broke everything.

2744
03:15:19,980 --> 03:15:20,320
That's okay.

2745
03:15:41,660 --> 03:15:43,100
Kitchen knife is best weapon.

2746
03:15:43,480 --> 03:15:45,240
I don't have a kitchen knife.

2747
03:15:45,400 --> 03:15:46,660
What do you want me to do?

2748
03:15:48,540 --> 03:15:50,480
Oh, use the weapon you don't have.

2749
03:15:51,020 --> 03:15:51,340
Okay.

2750
03:15:52,960 --> 03:15:54,340
Oh, I did get a sickle, though.

2751
03:15:54,480 --> 03:15:54,900
Let's go.

2752
03:16:00,350 --> 03:16:00,570
Oh.

2753
03:16:01,610 --> 03:16:06,910
I would love to get close to you and do this.

2754
03:16:09,570 --> 03:16:13,110
I'm about to lose all my sanity, though.

2755
03:16:13,130 --> 03:16:13,410
though.

2756
03:16:14,250 --> 03:16:15,870
And a steel pipe.

2757
03:16:17,650 --> 03:16:18,970
We'll take that over the baseball bat.

2758
03:16:19,130 --> 03:16:21,070
Actually, I don't know which one's better, but whatever.

2759
03:16:21,310 --> 03:16:22,190
I think they were similar.

2760
03:16:23,890 --> 03:16:25,510
I kind of liked using the bat, though.

2761
03:16:26,390 --> 03:16:27,770
It made me feel powerful.

2762
03:16:30,470 --> 03:16:30,710
Hello?

2763
03:16:31,310 --> 03:16:32,210
Oh, you again.

2764
03:16:33,910 --> 03:16:36,310
They love throwing this lady at you.

2765
03:16:36,750 --> 03:16:37,690
It's kind of horrible.

2766
03:16:46,900 --> 03:16:47,360
Oh my gosh.

2767
03:16:47,640 --> 03:16:47,640
Ouch.

2768
03:16:48,120 --> 03:16:48,460
Ouch.

2769
03:16:48,780 --> 03:16:49,080
Ouch.

2770
03:16:49,300 --> 03:16:49,300
Ouch.

2771
03:16:49,380 --> 03:16:49,380
Ouch.

2772
03:16:49,400 --> 03:16:50,240
Ouch, ouch!

2773
03:16:54,640 --> 03:16:56,200
Oh, Jesus, please!

2774
03:17:01,570 --> 03:17:02,050
Ah!

2775
03:17:02,670 --> 03:17:03,330
Yep, yep!

2776
03:17:07,710 --> 03:17:09,910
Ah, I tried to dodge, but I got stuck on something.

2777
03:17:11,170 --> 03:17:12,490
I got stuck on the environment.

2778
03:17:14,370 --> 03:17:14,810
Oh, oh.

2779
03:17:15,330 --> 03:17:15,650
Okay.

2780
03:17:17,670 --> 03:17:18,490
Lady, please!

2781
03:17:18,750 --> 03:17:19,490
Oh, no!

2782
03:17:30,290 --> 03:17:30,830
Please!

2783
03:17:35,510 --> 03:17:40,130
I'm trying to focus on not the blob of shit, please.

2784
03:17:40,510 --> 03:17:45,990
Oh my gosh.

2785
03:17:46,470 --> 03:17:46,970
Ouch!

2786
03:17:47,330 --> 03:17:47,330
Ouch!

2787
03:17:47,710 --> 03:17:48,030
Please!

2788
03:17:51,350 --> 03:17:52,950
This is too much.

2789
03:17:53,290 --> 03:17:54,170
This is too much!

2790
03:17:55,870 --> 03:17:57,310
No, that's not what I meant to do.

2791
03:17:57,470 --> 03:17:58,350
Actually, you know what, that's okay.

2792
03:17:59,730 --> 03:18:00,590
That works.

2793
03:18:03,550 --> 03:18:04,430
That works.

2794
03:18:09,270 --> 03:18:12,290
Okay, I'm gonna...

2795
03:18:18,230 --> 03:18:19,890
Oh, you are so evil.

2796
03:18:20,170 --> 03:18:20,630
Can I just...

2797
03:18:20,630 --> 03:18:21,590
No, I can't run past.

2798
03:18:23,810 --> 03:18:24,970
No, no, no, no, no.

2799
03:18:25,310 --> 03:18:26,070
Please, yes, yes.

2800
03:18:29,490 --> 03:18:49,990
I am I I am pressing dodge and I guess it's not fast enough for the game standards and it's so frustrating it's so frustrating no that's gonna turn into a but

2801
03:19:16,230 --> 03:19:29,850
I'm losing my absolute marbles please stop stop this oh my god this is just horrible I think I'm dead.

2802
03:19:33,350 --> 03:19:34,770
Oh my gosh.

2803
03:19:51,840 --> 03:19:53,120
Please die!

2804
03:19:53,420 --> 03:19:55,380
Why are you so tanky?

2805
03:19:57,940 --> 03:19:59,980
No, you can't pass through them.

2806
03:20:01,940 --> 03:20:02,540
Okay, good.

2807
03:20:02,780 --> 03:20:03,280
It's dead.

2808
03:20:04,440 --> 03:20:04,880
It's dead.

2809
03:20:05,460 --> 03:20:05,800
Jeez.

2810
03:20:07,300 --> 03:20:10,880
Because the pathway is blocked until you kill them.

2811
03:20:11,500 --> 03:20:13,640
It's so... it's torturous.

2812
03:20:14,500 --> 03:20:19,260
Especially because the thing like spawns enemies, but then it's also so tanky itself.

2813
03:20:22,400 --> 03:20:24,320
Ugh, they didn't give me any weapons.

2814
03:20:25,020 --> 03:20:26,040
I used my toolkit.

2815
03:20:28,380 --> 03:20:28,980
Evil.

2816
03:20:29,520 --> 03:20:30,520
Like actually evil.

2819
03:21:17,330 --> 03:21:20,570
Is there...

2820
03:21:20,570 --> 03:21:22,550
I could ask for more sanity.

2821
03:21:30,600 --> 03:21:31,300
Eco.

2822
03:21:37,820 --> 03:21:38,660
Die!

2823
03:21:39,080 --> 03:21:39,820
Die, bitch!

2824
03:21:40,740 --> 03:21:41,940
Oh, I got her.

2825
03:21:43,140 --> 03:21:44,340
And I get a knife!

2826
03:21:46,400 --> 03:21:47,140
Okay, Gam.

2827
03:21:48,520 --> 03:21:50,060
Wait, why am I focused on that?

2828
03:21:50,340 --> 03:21:52,400
Wait, you're gonna turn into...

2829
03:21:54,660 --> 03:21:55,140
Right?

2830
03:21:55,600 --> 03:21:56,040
Or no?

2831
03:22:04,400 --> 03:22:05,000
I saw...

2832
03:22:05,000 --> 03:22:05,620
Okay, that's...

2833
03:22:05,620 --> 03:22:07,300
I was like, I saw something to grab.

2834
03:22:09,540 --> 03:22:11,080
What if I just went this way instead?

2835
03:22:11,580 --> 03:22:12,140
What's this?

2836
03:22:12,440 --> 03:22:12,600
Oh!

2837
03:22:13,940 --> 03:22:14,880
Shimizu Hinako!

2838
03:22:15,320 --> 03:22:17,380
Last in wearing colored uniform, colored skirt.

2839
03:22:17,620 --> 03:22:18,640
This tail of disappearance.

2840
03:22:18,780 --> 03:22:21,480
Left hole met with wearing a...

2841
03:22:22,440 --> 03:22:22,960
On

2842
03:22:28,650 --> 03:22:29,370
the right way.

2843
03:22:31,190 --> 03:22:32,150
Yes, we are.

2844
03:22:36,570 --> 03:22:37,090
Die!

2845
03:22:37,910 --> 03:22:40,730
Oh, I didn't have her.

2846
03:22:41,450 --> 03:22:42,090
Oh, my gosh.

2847
03:22:42,870 --> 03:22:43,330
Another sickle.

2848
03:22:44,010 --> 03:22:44,650
Let's do that.

2849
03:22:45,050 --> 03:22:46,410
I don't like the slow weapons.

2850
03:22:47,310 --> 03:22:48,450
I'm a missing person.

2851
03:22:48,630 --> 03:22:48,950
Why?

2852
03:22:51,670 --> 03:22:52,510
Oh, my God.

2853
03:22:52,710 --> 03:22:53,190
Oh, my God.

2854
03:22:55,530 --> 03:22:56,050
Hedge.

2855
03:23:04,680 --> 03:23:05,940
Oh, no, no, no.

2856
03:23:05,960 --> 03:23:07,380
Oh god, please, no!

2857
03:23:10,300 --> 03:23:13,860
No, not the titty monster again!

2858
03:23:14,440 --> 03:23:15,400
I'm tired!

2859
03:23:18,720 --> 03:23:20,920
I'm tired of the titty monster!

2860
03:23:22,260 --> 03:23:23,660
I'm tired of this life!

2861
03:23:24,740 --> 03:23:26,200
Why are there three of them?

2862
03:23:35,400 --> 03:23:37,120
It's too much!

2863
03:23:38,860 --> 03:23:43,500
I never thought I would say too much booba, but there's a first for everything, I suppose.

2864
03:23:44,100 --> 03:23:44,700
Do I have enough?

2865
03:23:53,140 --> 03:23:54,360
Leave me alone.

2866
03:23:54,720 --> 03:23:55,500
Leave me alone.

2867
03:23:55,680 --> 03:23:56,140
Leave me alone.

2868
03:23:56,360 --> 03:23:57,660
Leave me alone.

2869
03:23:57,900 --> 03:23:58,480
Leave me alone.

2870
03:23:58,740 --> 03:23:59,240
Leave me alone.

2871
03:24:00,760 --> 03:24:01,200
Dodge?

2872
03:24:01,440 --> 03:24:01,800
There we go.

2873
03:24:02,300 --> 03:24:04,080
I just barely...

2874
03:24:04,080 --> 03:24:04,360
Stop.

2875
03:24:04,460 --> 03:24:05,340
I don't want to look at that.

2876
03:24:06,160 --> 03:24:07,720
Oh my god, there's another thing!

2877
03:24:10,230 --> 03:24:12,070
There's another monster!

2878
03:24:18,730 --> 03:24:20,610
Wait, when did I lose my...

2879
03:24:20,610 --> 03:24:21,190
Aw, man.

2880
03:24:22,830 --> 03:24:23,630
Is this sickle, buddy?

2881
03:24:24,410 --> 03:24:24,650
Ouch.

2882
03:24:24,870 --> 03:24:25,470
Ouch, ouch.

2883
03:24:25,470 --> 03:24:25,710
Ouch, ouch.

2884
03:24:25,710 --> 03:24:25,710
Ouch,

2885
03:24:29,530 --> 03:24:29,650
ouch.

2886
03:24:31,390 --> 03:24:31,830
Please.

2887
03:24:32,910 --> 03:24:34,570
Okay, that's just an explodey one.

2888
03:24:36,830 --> 03:24:37,450
Oh, no.

2889
03:24:37,670 --> 03:24:38,730
That's not an explodey one.

2890
03:24:40,230 --> 03:24:40,670
Wait, wait, wait.

2891
03:24:41,090 --> 03:24:41,430
Not him.

2892
03:24:45,530 --> 03:24:45,530
This!

2893
03:24:51,260 --> 03:24:51,720
Oh shit.

2894
03:24:52,440 --> 03:24:53,240
Oh shit, oh shit.

2895
03:24:57,990 --> 03:24:59,410
Okay, we got her.

2896
03:25:00,770 --> 03:25:02,070
Holy cow.

2897
03:25:03,750 --> 03:25:05,610
I think that's another weapon right there.

2898
03:25:06,310 --> 03:25:07,070
What is this?

2899
03:25:07,570 --> 03:25:08,010
Crowbar!

2900
03:25:08,910 --> 03:25:09,710
I'll take it.

2901
03:25:10,630 --> 03:25:12,110
We love Crowbar.

2902
03:25:12,470 --> 03:25:13,330
We love it.

2903
03:25:13,510 --> 03:25:14,550
Crowbar, Crowbar.

2904
03:25:15,490 --> 03:25:16,810
Crowbar, Crowbar.

2905
03:25:19,410 --> 03:25:23,090
It's like, almost like a boss rush, but there's not bosses.

2906
03:25:23,770 --> 03:25:25,350
It's just annoying guys.

2907
03:25:30,820 --> 03:25:31,620
What's happening?

2908
03:25:31,920 --> 03:25:32,000
Oh.

2909
03:25:34,460 --> 03:25:35,380
Did I go the wrong way?

2910
03:25:36,140 --> 03:25:37,920
Yeah, just teddy monsters.

2911
03:25:38,160 --> 03:25:38,880
Mob rush.

2912
03:25:39,260 --> 03:25:39,920
Yeah, that's the word.

2913
03:25:44,730 --> 03:25:45,770
My arm!

2914
03:25:46,170 --> 03:25:46,510
Uh-oh.

2915
03:25:46,890 --> 03:25:47,530
Wait a second.

2916
03:25:52,510 --> 03:25:53,110
Uh-oh.

2917
03:25:53,310 --> 03:25:53,330
Uh-oh.

2918
03:26:10,830 --> 03:26:12,030
It's like, can I go?

2919
03:26:12,170 --> 03:26:12,770
Don't be stupid.

2920
03:26:29,380 --> 03:26:30,800
You're being really rude.

2921
03:26:37,320 --> 03:26:37,500
What?

2922
03:26:43,360 --> 03:26:45,200
You're being really rude.

2923
03:26:56,530 --> 03:26:59,510
The arm is...

2924
03:26:59,510 --> 03:27:01,710
The hair has grown so much.

2925
03:27:03,210 --> 03:27:04,730
She's so creepy.

2926
03:27:15,240 --> 03:27:16,980
The path of self-preservation.

2927
03:27:17,500 --> 03:27:18,620
I refuse.

2928
03:27:23,890 --> 03:27:25,410
So did we just kill...

2929
03:27:27,150 --> 03:27:27,810
Hinako?

2930
03:27:28,070 --> 03:27:28,990
Shimizu Hinako?

2931
03:27:29,250 --> 03:27:30,310
Now we are just Hinako?

2932
03:27:31,550 --> 03:27:34,830
God, I can feel it.

2933
03:27:48,450 --> 03:27:50,030
The bunny ears live.

2934
03:27:50,670 --> 03:27:51,890
Congrats on clearing the gauntlet.

2935
03:27:52,290 --> 03:27:53,750
A section is always the worst to go through.

2936
03:27:54,550 --> 03:27:54,910
Thank you!

2937
03:27:55,110 --> 03:27:55,850
Thanks, Cake!

2938
03:28:00,760 --> 03:28:02,180
Yeah, no spoilers.

2939
03:28:27,840 --> 03:28:30,080
Oh, yeah, I remember this part, this place.

2940
03:28:49,260 --> 03:28:51,420
You'd think he'd at least let her change.

2941
03:28:58,770 --> 03:29:00,590
Yeah, just follow his lead.

2942
03:29:04,410 --> 03:29:05,990
She's like, I don't know this ritual.

2943
03:29:06,250 --> 03:29:07,090
What's going on?

2944
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:07,670
What are we doing?

2945
03:29:13,710 --> 03:29:15,970
Hidako is controlled by her arm and jeans.

2946
03:29:16,650 --> 03:29:17,450
Liquid Hidako.

2947
03:29:22,570 --> 03:29:25,590
Shimizu Hidako lives on through this arm.

2948
03:29:34,930 --> 03:29:36,350
Getting married overseas.

2949
03:29:36,710 --> 03:29:37,010
B-row.

2950
03:29:38,390 --> 03:29:39,470
I was thinking.

2951
03:29:39,610 --> 03:29:42,130
I was like, she feels like a foreigner.

2952
03:29:43,570 --> 03:29:43,690
Right.

2953
03:29:43,710 --> 03:29:46,970
She's just kind of like looking at the person and be like, Oh, okay, okay, I'll do that.

2954
03:29:59,540 --> 03:29:59,840
Huh?

2955
03:30:07,990 --> 03:30:10,370
You look at the voice, but Cam Clark.

2956
03:30:15,410 --> 03:30:17,070
Oh, oh, gosh.

2957
03:30:17,330 --> 03:30:19,170
I hope none of you have the tropophobia.

2958
03:30:20,610 --> 03:30:21,490
Oh, gross.

2959
03:30:22,350 --> 03:30:23,230
Oh, ew.

2960
03:30:24,370 --> 03:30:24,810
Oh,

2961
03:30:32,040 --> 03:30:32,380
my God.

2962
03:30:32,480 --> 03:30:33,440
It's so nasty.

2963
03:30:39,490 --> 03:30:40,910
Oh my gosh.

2964
03:30:46,470 --> 03:30:47,690
Yeah, don't look.

2965
03:30:49,030 --> 03:30:51,090
I'll tell you when the triple phobia part is over.

2966
03:30:53,030 --> 03:30:53,650
I think it's over.

2967
03:31:05,930 --> 03:31:07,830
What do you call that?

2968
03:31:18,470 --> 03:31:20,010
Oh my gosh.

2969
03:31:20,410 --> 03:31:21,890
She means to hear that go.

2970
03:31:25,530 --> 03:31:34,470
Do you like my fox bass, Kinnako?

2971
03:31:39,960 --> 03:31:40,700
Like her chula.

2972
03:31:41,160 --> 03:31:42,850
Yeah, that's what she do.

2973
03:31:46,560 --> 03:31:49,040
Do the flowers sprout everywhere she walks?

2974
03:31:49,420 --> 03:31:50,360
Wait, that's beautiful!

2975
03:31:58,000 --> 03:31:58,520
What do you spot?

2976
03:31:58,620 --> 03:31:58,920
Other spots?

2977
03:31:58,940 --> 03:32:00,060
spider lilies, right?

2978
03:32:01,500 --> 03:32:02,880
Oh my gosh!

2979
03:32:06,160 --> 03:32:07,000
Oh, just kidding.

2980
03:32:08,140 --> 03:32:21,740
It reminds me of that one like, I guess, I don't know what to call it, beast in, uh, in, um, Mononokehime, Princess Mononokehime.

2981
03:32:24,880 --> 03:32:25,900
I agree!

2982
03:32:26,320 --> 03:32:27,360
This is an improvement!

2983
03:32:28,940 --> 03:32:31,580
Don't mind the globs of flesh.

2984
03:32:33,600 --> 03:32:34,640
Just, uh...

2985
03:32:34,640 --> 03:32:35,620
Look, and we match!

2986
03:32:35,940 --> 03:32:37,860
No wonder she loves pink so much.

2987
03:32:38,020 --> 03:32:39,500
She painted the whole town pink.

2988
03:32:42,140 --> 03:32:43,800
What is that?

2989
03:32:44,960 --> 03:32:46,100
Oh, no!

2990
03:32:47,720 --> 03:32:49,400
Don't go that way!

2991
03:32:49,780 --> 03:32:49,800
Oh!

2992
03:32:51,400 --> 03:32:52,500
Wait, what's happening?

2993
03:32:58,380 --> 03:32:59,300
Oh, gosh.

2994
03:33:00,260 --> 03:33:00,640
Wait.

2995
03:33:11,660 --> 03:33:12,640
Can I soul siphon still?

2996
03:33:12,780 --> 03:33:13,040
Yeah.

2997
03:33:15,480 --> 03:33:15,840
Oh!

2998
03:33:16,000 --> 03:33:16,220
Ouch!

2999
03:33:16,400 --> 03:33:17,300
I thought I killed you.

3000
03:33:20,340 --> 03:33:21,260
There we go.

3001
03:33:31,950 --> 03:33:32,990
How do I get home?

3002
03:33:35,630 --> 03:33:37,790
To the... Okay, I head to the left.

3003
03:33:38,350 --> 03:33:39,410
But first...

3004
03:33:39,410 --> 03:33:40,750
Oh, okay, I can't even go this way.

3005
03:33:41,030 --> 03:33:44,990
I keep seeing... I kept looking at that bandage and I'm like, I just want to pick it up.

3006
03:33:48,310 --> 03:33:49,410
Don't go that way.

3007
03:33:50,130 --> 03:33:53,410
Ma'am, there's meat blobs blocking everywhere.

3008
03:33:54,610 --> 03:33:55,730
I don't think I have a choice.

3009
03:33:56,670 --> 03:33:57,410
Even the well.

3010
03:33:58,110 --> 03:33:59,310
What's there to drink?

3011
03:33:59,990 --> 03:34:00,350
Meat!

3012
03:34:01,490 --> 03:34:03,790
What are you supposed to do in a situation like that?

3013
03:34:06,010 --> 03:34:07,630
Become a monster, but you're still...

3014
03:34:07,630 --> 03:34:08,850
Yeah, it's like...

3015
03:34:08,850 --> 03:34:13,110
We're a monster, but I'm still like a little clumsy because I'm like, Where am I?

3016
03:34:13,530 --> 03:34:13,890
I know.

3017
03:34:14,270 --> 03:34:18,030
I'm a little lost.

3018
03:34:20,730 --> 03:34:21,610
Oh, okay.

3019
03:34:21,890 --> 03:34:24,190
I thought I heard a...

3020
03:34:26,140 --> 03:34:27,220
Oh my gosh!

3021
03:34:33,440 --> 03:34:35,220
Sorry, I'm just making sure...

3022
03:34:35,220 --> 03:34:36,420
Can we go this way?

3023
03:34:38,260 --> 03:34:39,240
Is there anything over here?

3024
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:41,560
Wow.

3025
03:34:42,420 --> 03:34:42,960
Artwork?

3026
03:34:43,560 --> 03:34:44,100
The bandage.

3027
03:34:45,320 --> 03:34:45,540
And?

3028
03:34:46,000 --> 03:34:47,260
A dried carcass.

3029
03:34:47,760 --> 03:34:48,040
Wood!

3030
03:34:49,940 --> 03:34:50,940
It's locked.

3031
03:34:52,080 --> 03:35:11,620
have to what we don't have to worry about weapons anymore wait this is so nice i feel like part of that is always my concern in these types of games where i'm like i'm like ah can i can i get

3032
03:35:15,290 --> 03:35:22,270
can i get a new weapon in time you know am i gonna get the weapon that i want

3033
03:35:25,730 --> 03:35:27,530
Yeah, oh, whoops, that's not my MS Press.

3034
03:35:27,770 --> 03:35:28,110
My bad.

3035
03:35:28,830 --> 03:35:30,630
Yeah, durability always scares me.

3036
03:35:32,450 --> 03:35:34,990
Makes you really kind of like, oh, do I need to run?

3037
03:35:35,190 --> 03:35:36,610
Do I need to...

3038
03:35:36,610 --> 03:35:37,430
It's the very...

3039
03:35:37,430 --> 03:35:40,190
It's the very the survival horror aspect.

3040
03:35:40,650 --> 03:35:42,290
Mr. Potsdam would love this play.

3041
03:35:43,790 --> 03:35:46,010
The new version of Bloodboard is weird, but cool.

3042
03:35:46,270 --> 03:35:46,770
Oh, yeah.

3043
03:35:46,970 --> 03:35:47,370
Oh, yeah.

3044
03:35:48,270 --> 03:35:49,650
No, this is DMC-6.

3045
03:35:49,730 --> 03:35:50,490
What are you talking about?

3046
03:35:56,100 --> 03:35:57,100
Is there still a...

3047
03:35:57,120 --> 03:35:58,500
Is there a shrine here to save?

3048
03:35:58,980 --> 03:36:00,320
Yes, there is.

3049
03:36:07,420 --> 03:36:09,680
The music, though, is so sad.

3050
03:36:09,980 --> 03:36:12,540
Like, it just sounds sad.

3051
03:36:28,390 --> 03:36:29,830
Furry may cry.

3052
03:36:33,310 --> 03:36:33,810
Nice.

3053
03:36:35,350 --> 03:36:40,110
That's how you know, like, there's gonna be a big old boss battle at the end, because it's still giving you a lot.

3054
03:36:40,130 --> 03:36:43,150
Oh no, my dog!

3055
03:36:43,550 --> 03:36:44,150
My dog!

3056
03:36:46,750 --> 03:36:48,470
Wait, I thought I saw something over here.

3057
03:36:48,850 --> 03:36:49,290
Am I crazy?

3058
03:36:50,710 --> 03:36:51,810
Yes, I am.

3059
03:36:52,330 --> 03:36:52,630
Sorry.

3060
03:36:53,890 --> 03:36:54,630
I got it!

3061
03:36:56,570 --> 03:36:58,310
Oh wait, actually, I'm sorry.

3062
03:36:58,570 --> 03:37:00,070
I just noticed I got the dried carcass.

3063
03:37:00,710 --> 03:37:01,970
I'm gonna go offer that too.

3064
03:37:03,930 --> 03:37:05,630
Sorry, we're emptying our inventory.

3065
03:37:05,850 --> 03:37:09,490
I might even, since I got the Emma, I might actually upgrade eventually.

3066
03:37:10,170 --> 03:37:11,630
Is it something else?

3067
03:37:12,950 --> 03:37:17,990
Like I feel like we could get the health.

3068
03:37:18,190 --> 03:37:19,270
We definitely could get the health.

3069
03:37:20,170 --> 03:37:21,390
Might be able to get the stamina.

3070
03:37:22,530 --> 03:37:22,810
Maybe.

3071
03:37:31,560 --> 03:37:32,860
Hinako just killed Hinako.

3072
03:37:33,120 --> 03:37:33,800
It's pretty sad.

3073
03:37:34,920 --> 03:37:35,860
It is sad.

3074
03:37:37,460 --> 03:37:38,280
Poor baby girl.

3075
03:37:47,360 --> 03:37:49,260
What if I just walk past you?

3076
03:37:50,620 --> 03:37:52,200
What if I don't check?

3077
03:37:53,760 --> 03:37:55,360
Oh, it forces me?

3078
03:37:55,720 --> 03:37:56,680
Wait, what do you say anyway?

3079
03:37:57,640 --> 03:37:58,380
Wait, what do you say?

3080
03:37:58,580 --> 03:37:58,780
Ah!

3081
03:37:59,640 --> 03:37:59,780
Ah!

3082
03:38:06,100 --> 03:38:07,920
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

3083
03:38:10,380 --> 03:38:10,780
Stupid.

3084
03:38:17,020 --> 03:38:17,420
Yeah!

3085
03:38:19,720 --> 03:38:20,640
Soul Siphon you?

3086
03:38:21,520 --> 03:38:21,900
Nice.

3087
03:38:30,830 --> 03:38:32,150
I hear another one.

3088
03:38:38,800 --> 03:38:39,960
Wait, why isn't it... Oh, there we go.

3089
03:38:40,840 --> 03:38:42,120
I was like, why is it not... Focus?

3090
03:38:42,140 --> 03:39:16,660

3091
03:39:16,820 --> 03:39:18,240
I actually am a localizer.

3092
03:39:19,160 --> 03:39:20,360
I translated that part.

3093
03:39:24,680 --> 03:39:28,520
She says something about not being able to stay the way she is now.

3094
03:39:30,100 --> 03:39:31,140
That's so sad.

3095
03:39:31,480 --> 03:39:32,360
Wait, hold on.

3096
03:39:33,740 --> 03:39:36,360
Sorry, I'm... I'm definitely...

3097
03:39:37,000 --> 03:39:37,780
Okay, nothing.

3098
03:39:38,760 --> 03:39:39,220
Oh, see?

3099
03:39:39,460 --> 03:39:42,700
I'm definitely being a little loot goblin right now.

3100
03:39:42,820 --> 03:39:43,120
I'm sorry.

3101
03:39:43,840 --> 03:39:44,800
We'll go home, we'll go home.

3102
03:39:45,360 --> 03:39:45,860
Look at him!

3103
03:39:46,020 --> 03:39:47,620
Look, it's so beautiful, though!

3104
03:39:48,320 --> 03:39:49,540
I don't blame her.

3105
03:39:50,440 --> 03:39:53,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay.

3106
03:39:54,800 --> 03:39:56,780
Oh, it's this guy.

3107
03:39:57,380 --> 03:39:57,380
Okay.

3108
03:40:01,450 --> 03:40:02,510
We are close.

3109
03:40:02,670 --> 03:40:04,390
If we can, like, bait her over here.

3110
03:40:07,850 --> 03:40:10,710
I don't want to get both involved, is the issue.

3111
03:40:12,150 --> 03:40:14,690
I want to be able to go Yeti mode to defeat you.

3112
03:40:15,290 --> 03:40:15,690
Can I?

3113
03:40:16,010 --> 03:40:17,190
Can you please let me do that?

3114
03:40:17,210 --> 03:40:17,370
What?

3115
03:40:17,710 --> 03:40:19,650
Are you following me down here?

3116
03:40:20,470 --> 03:40:20,850
Fine.

3117
03:40:22,810 --> 03:40:23,410
Oh, I missed.

3118
03:40:23,970 --> 03:40:25,210
I missed.

3119
03:40:26,270 --> 03:40:27,350
How could you miss?

3120
03:40:30,150 --> 03:40:30,830
Oh, oops.

3121
03:40:31,610 --> 03:40:32,390
Dodge, dodge.

3122
03:40:32,570 --> 03:40:32,850
Oh, wait.

3123
03:40:32,970 --> 03:40:33,630
I have no stamina.

3124
03:40:42,740 --> 03:40:44,300
Turn around, you big dummy.

3125
03:40:48,830 --> 03:40:49,530
Oh, wow.

3126
03:40:49,710 --> 03:40:51,110
Wait, I took him out so easily.

3127
03:40:53,970 --> 03:40:55,250
strong now.

3128
03:40:59,050 --> 03:40:59,490
Dang, okay.

3129
03:41:00,770 --> 03:41:01,850
I'm insane now.

3130
03:41:02,410 --> 03:41:03,290
Insano mode.

3131
03:41:05,730 --> 03:41:06,450
Oh, I missed again.

3132
03:41:06,990 --> 03:41:08,170
So embarrassing.

3133
03:41:15,520 --> 03:41:16,160
Dodge.

3134
03:41:17,180 --> 03:41:17,440
No!

3135
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:19,960
Yeah, get them both at the same time!

3136
03:41:21,540 --> 03:41:21,920
Yeah!

3137
03:41:23,520 --> 03:41:24,920
Can I soul siphon this one?

3138
03:41:25,060 --> 03:41:25,220
Okay.

3139
03:41:30,020 --> 03:41:30,660
Nice.

3140
03:41:31,320 --> 03:41:35,860
I was gonna say, wait, can I go in here?

3141
03:41:36,080 --> 03:41:37,020
That'd be kind of crazy.

3142
03:41:41,560 --> 03:41:42,320
Marriage buff?

3143
03:41:42,660 --> 03:41:45,100
Oh gosh, stinking couples, man.

3144
03:41:47,660 --> 03:41:51,720
They're all, like, they get married once and they just make it their whole personality, you know?

3145
03:42:11,750 --> 03:42:12,730
Oh, are you still...

3146
03:42:12,730 --> 03:42:12,910
Oh.

3147
03:42:15,950 --> 03:42:17,350
Why is she a rabbit?

3148
03:42:17,470 --> 03:42:19,090
with a werewolf arm.

3149
03:42:22,610 --> 03:42:32,730
If you could be anything that your little mind imagines, what do you think you would be?

3150
03:42:33,590 --> 03:42:35,210
A rabbit with a Yeti arm?

3151
03:42:37,230 --> 03:42:39,250
Most people choose that option.

3152
03:42:42,130 --> 03:42:47,030
Most people choose rabbit with a Yeti arm.

3153
03:42:49,130 --> 03:43:03,450
science shows that 99 95 sorry i don't want to exaggerate it 95 percent of people choose a rabbit with a yeti arm we're

3154
03:43:15,470 --> 03:43:38,510
just doing it for fun now nine out of ten dentists sorry i just realized i went in a circle because i'm silly for absolute silliness right now i like how only the shrines have like nothing even the flowers don't grow at all on them it's cool and we have some antique comb

3155
03:43:44,660 --> 03:44:05,360
oh we can do stamina I don't know what do you guys think the remaining 5% choose Yeti with a rabbit arm does this make her more attractive to Fox Boys possibly so take notes everybody anyone looking to get yourself a foxy man.

3156
03:44:08,160 --> 03:44:09,140
Or a foxman.

3157
03:44:12,750 --> 03:44:14,050
It's, uh,

3158
03:44:17,330 --> 03:44:18,710
it's just one of those things.

3159
03:44:19,550 --> 03:44:20,050
Noted.

3160
03:44:21,670 --> 03:44:23,130
Not a fox lady?

3161
03:44:25,110 --> 03:44:26,410
I'm really not quite sure.

3162
03:44:28,150 --> 03:44:29,630
What do you have to say this time?

3163
03:44:30,990 --> 03:44:33,310
You won't be able to stay as you are now.

3164
03:44:36,190 --> 03:44:38,550
Takizo, thank you so much for the Ten!

3165
03:44:39,090 --> 03:44:49,790
You did Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, they're coming from all over Oh, oops Oh Wait, hold on I'm gonna go sicko mode

3166
03:45:03,080 --> 03:45:04,140
Is that it?

3167
03:45:05,360 --> 03:45:09,780
No, of course not Oh, I can't Oh, okay

3168
03:45:22,630 --> 03:45:24,170
Oh, we lost it

3169
03:45:27,590 --> 03:45:29,550
Oh, maybe I used it too early.

3170
03:45:30,070 --> 03:45:30,490
Uh-oh.

3171
03:45:31,470 --> 03:45:32,530
I used it too...

3172
03:45:32,530 --> 03:45:34,210
Oh, I used it too early, you guys!

3173
03:45:34,310 --> 03:45:35,730
I think I used it too early!

3174
03:45:36,330 --> 03:45:36,830
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3175
03:45:37,650 --> 03:45:37,890
Wait.

3176
03:45:38,410 --> 03:45:39,010
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3177
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:39,370
Wait.

3178
03:45:39,630 --> 03:45:40,830
I used it too early.

3179
03:45:42,330 --> 03:45:44,150
I went to Soul Siphon that.

3180
03:45:46,390 --> 03:45:46,670
Woo!

3181
03:45:46,850 --> 03:45:48,070
Holy moly!

3182
03:45:48,450 --> 03:45:48,630
Woo!

3183
03:45:49,010 --> 03:45:49,470
Wait,

3184
03:45:52,830 --> 03:45:53,350
wait, wait, wait, wait.

3185
03:45:53,690 --> 03:45:54,230
Wait, please.

3186
03:45:54,810 --> 03:45:55,410
Be kind.

3187
03:45:56,130 --> 03:45:56,770
Be kind.

3188
03:45:57,230 --> 03:45:57,670
Be kind.

3189
03:46:06,860 --> 03:46:07,960
Oh, that was close.

3190
03:46:08,140 --> 03:46:08,420
Oh my gosh.

3191
03:46:08,800 --> 03:46:09,700
Wait, I'm trying to get out of here.

3192
03:46:09,820 --> 03:46:10,260
Thank you.

3193
03:46:19,720 --> 03:46:20,040
Oh!

3194
03:46:40,440 --> 03:46:41,780
Oh, I was doing so well.

3195
03:46:44,640 --> 03:46:45,440
I was doing so well.

3196
03:46:50,490 --> 03:46:51,090
Oh, dang it.

3197
03:46:51,110 --> 03:46:51,770
I thought that got him.

3198
03:46:51,950 --> 03:46:52,670
I'm not gonna lie.

3199
03:47:00,350 --> 03:47:03,410
Okay, this guy should give us a big siphon, though, right?

3200
03:47:04,150 --> 03:47:05,030
Lots of souls.

3201
03:47:05,950 --> 03:47:06,510
Oh, yeah.

3202
03:47:06,670 --> 03:47:07,210
Oh, yeah.

3203
03:47:07,610 --> 03:47:08,050
Oh, yeah.

3204
03:47:08,170 --> 03:47:08,510
Oh, yeah.

3205
03:47:09,450 --> 03:47:09,790
Delicious.

3206
03:47:16,370 --> 03:47:17,130
I kinda...

3207
03:47:17,510 --> 03:47:18,430
I'm not gonna lie.

3208
03:47:18,650 --> 03:47:19,150
I understand.

3209
03:47:19,430 --> 03:47:20,150
I messed that one up.

3210
03:47:20,950 --> 03:47:21,930
Wait, what can we get rid of?

3211
03:47:23,410 --> 03:47:23,790
I guess.

3212
03:47:26,110 --> 03:47:28,410
I feel like we need the chocolate now more than ever.

3213
03:47:28,990 --> 03:47:29,310
You know?

3214
03:47:29,510 --> 03:47:31,050
I don't want to get rid of my Inazushi.

3215
03:47:31,850 --> 03:47:32,890
We're fine, I think.

3216
03:47:33,530 --> 03:47:33,950
We're okay.

3217
03:47:37,890 --> 03:47:38,830
I did fine.

3218
03:47:39,450 --> 03:47:42,230
But I released, I pulled my devil trigger too early, I think.

3219
03:47:43,010 --> 03:47:43,790
It's okay, though.

3220
03:47:44,270 --> 03:47:44,830
We made it.

3221
03:47:46,590 --> 03:47:47,550
Oh, is this home?

3222
03:47:51,960 --> 03:47:55,080
Before we go in, though, I haven't really, like, looked over here.

3223
03:47:56,320 --> 03:47:57,240
I think I did before.

3224
03:47:58,840 --> 03:47:59,100
Oh!

3225
03:47:59,880 --> 03:48:01,140
Oh, wait, this is my home.

3226
03:48:01,640 --> 03:48:02,780
Wait, whose house is it?

3227
03:48:03,660 --> 03:48:07,240
I was just about to enter a stranger's property.

3228
03:48:08,420 --> 03:48:09,940
But I'm gonna do it now, anyway.

3229
03:48:12,460 --> 03:48:15,680
Oh, there's nothing here.

3230
03:48:23,590 --> 03:48:25,110
Wow, it's so beautiful.

3231
03:48:25,670 --> 03:48:26,950
You think a cutscene's gonna happen?

3232
03:48:28,850 --> 03:48:29,610
Okay, hold on, guys.

3233
03:48:30,150 --> 03:48:30,670
Hold on, mom.

3234
03:48:30,850 --> 03:48:31,330
Hold on, dad.

3235
03:48:33,490 --> 03:48:34,610
Oh, there's nothing over here.

3236
03:48:35,470 --> 03:48:36,130
It's all goop.

3237
03:48:37,030 --> 03:48:38,290
It's all big old meat goop.

3238
03:48:46,890 --> 03:48:48,030
Do you recognize me?

3239
03:48:48,730 --> 03:48:49,270
It's me!

3240
03:48:49,830 --> 03:48:50,270
Hinako!

3241
03:48:51,650 --> 03:48:52,470
I've grown.

3242
03:48:52,730 --> 03:48:53,110
I've grown.

3243
03:48:53,630 --> 03:49:05,770
through a the kids call this a growth spurt whoa now that's a growth spurt

3244
03:49:30,360 --> 03:49:33,260
Quit your crocodile tears.

3245
03:49:36,240 --> 03:49:38,420
I'm gonna turn you into a puddle.

3246
03:49:44,110 --> 03:49:45,610
Puddle them.

3247
03:49:46,230 --> 03:49:47,310
Make them into a puddle.

3248
03:49:49,790 --> 03:49:51,590
When did we get two arms?

3249
03:49:56,820 --> 03:49:57,880
Get gooped!

3250
03:50:08,460 --> 03:50:13,260
The path of exultation.

3251
03:50:13,640 --> 03:50:14,420
I accept.

3252
03:50:15,540 --> 03:50:15,620
The

3253
03:50:30,270 --> 03:50:33,450
Ooh, regular Hinako.

3254
03:50:34,370 --> 03:50:35,790
Wait, this is Shimizu Hinako.

3255
03:50:36,370 --> 03:50:36,910
My doll!

3256
03:50:41,070 --> 03:50:43,230
Help Shimizu Hinako, please!

3257
03:50:43,690 --> 03:50:45,050
Oh, my crowbar!

3258
03:50:46,030 --> 03:50:47,290
Oh, wait, no, no, no.

3259
03:50:47,890 --> 03:50:50,970
Wait, I'm in this world, but I don't have Yeti powers?

3260
03:50:53,970 --> 03:50:54,670
Uh-oh.

3261
03:50:56,010 --> 03:50:57,850
Oh my gosh, how much more is there?

3262
03:50:58,690 --> 03:50:59,290
Proceed.

3263
03:51:02,150 --> 03:51:03,750
How much more is there?

3264
03:51:05,450 --> 03:51:07,310
No point in turning back now.

3265
03:51:11,230 --> 03:51:11,770
Almost at the end?

3266
03:51:16,870 --> 03:51:19,670
I'm being a little, like I said, a little loot goblin.

3267
03:51:20,710 --> 03:51:22,490
This is what women's dreams are like.

3268
03:51:23,790 --> 03:51:26,230
Yeah, they're either this or they're sexy.

3269
03:51:27,890 --> 03:51:30,230
Or this and sexy.

3270
03:51:31,470 --> 03:51:32,630
A willow wisp!

3271
03:51:33,410 --> 03:51:36,890
Good to see you guys.

3272
03:51:38,390 --> 03:51:39,990
Oh my gosh, it looks just like you.

3273
03:51:40,690 --> 03:51:41,370
Look how cute.

3274
03:51:42,670 --> 03:51:43,070
Hi.

3275
03:51:44,970 --> 03:51:48,170
Oh, it looks just like you.

3276
03:51:49,110 --> 03:51:51,470
You guys are in the game, you didn't tell me?

3277
03:51:58,450 --> 03:51:58,930
Pretty,

3278
03:52:18,890 --> 03:52:19,630
so pretty.

3279
03:52:22,130 --> 03:52:22,530
Oh, I remember.

3280
03:52:23,050 --> 03:52:24,950
I've been through all of this!

3281
03:52:26,250 --> 03:52:26,530
Yeah!

3282
03:52:30,750 --> 03:52:31,870
With all...

3283
03:52:31,870 --> 03:52:33,650
Oh no, these things are still here?

3284
03:52:34,370 --> 03:52:37,470
Wait, I'm gonna lose it.

3285
03:52:39,940 --> 03:52:51,910
I thought I heard...

3286
03:52:51,910 --> 03:52:52,850
I thought I heard it.

3287
03:52:54,450 --> 03:52:55,790
Like I thought I heard the chains.

3288
03:52:56,670 --> 03:52:58,870
Maybe I'm imagining it.

3289
03:52:59,650 --> 03:53:00,570
Maybe it's PTSD.

3290
03:53:02,930 --> 03:53:05,470
Or maybe it actually happened just to be like, hey, remember.

3291
03:53:06,330 --> 03:53:07,970
Remember what you've been through.

3292
03:53:08,850 --> 03:53:09,850
Oh no, it just saved.

3293
03:53:12,670 --> 03:53:12,970
Oh!

3294
03:53:22,780 --> 03:53:23,300
Yeah!

3295
03:53:33,660 --> 03:53:34,180
Yeah!

3296
03:53:35,780 --> 03:53:36,920
Oh, no stamina.

3297
03:53:37,140 --> 03:53:37,480
Oh, shoot.

3298
03:53:37,600 --> 03:53:39,080
What a terrible time to not have stamina.

3299
03:53:42,400 --> 03:53:44,060
Oh, we're so good.

3300
03:53:46,280 --> 03:53:47,780
Rip and tear, rip and tear!

3301
03:53:48,680 --> 03:53:49,880
So much kudzu.

3302
03:53:51,260 --> 03:53:51,720
Allale.

3303
03:53:52,900 --> 03:53:54,640
Wait, we have so much stuff.

3304
03:53:56,480 --> 03:53:57,060
What's here?

3305
03:53:57,320 --> 03:53:57,840
Toolkit!

3306
03:53:58,080 --> 03:53:58,740
Wait, that's huge.

3307
03:53:59,980 --> 03:54:01,460
Divine water even.

3308
03:54:01,920 --> 03:54:03,220
Wow, they're just like, you thirsty?

3309
03:54:03,500 --> 03:54:03,840
You hungry?

3310
03:54:05,320 --> 03:54:06,440
You need repairs?

3311
03:54:06,760 --> 03:54:07,100
You good?

3312
03:54:07,880 --> 03:54:08,400
You good?

3313
03:54:08,740 --> 03:54:09,360
You good girl?

3314
03:54:16,650 --> 03:54:22,570
So now we go, I guess we go through all these areas again, and we fight.

3315
03:54:23,950 --> 03:54:25,150
This was long, though.

3316
03:54:25,250 --> 03:54:26,650
We can't go through everything, right?

3317
03:54:27,310 --> 03:54:28,970
We went through a lot of stuff.

3318
03:54:30,790 --> 03:54:30,930
Who?

3319
03:54:31,350 --> 03:54:32,370
Wait, who's in my way?

3320
03:54:36,350 --> 03:54:40,030
Oh, gosh.

3321
03:54:40,870 --> 03:54:41,970
It's this guy.

3322
03:54:42,170 --> 03:54:42,930
This bozo.

3323
03:54:44,190 --> 03:54:45,630
It's like a boss rush.

3324
03:54:45,730 --> 03:54:47,110
Oh, gosh.

3325
03:54:54,630 --> 03:54:56,130
I wanted to get you first!

3326
03:54:57,510 --> 03:54:58,030
Oh, I did.

3327
03:55:02,230 --> 03:55:02,450
Ah!

3328
03:55:04,190 --> 03:55:04,450
Ah!

3329
03:55:05,910 --> 03:55:09,230
Oh, a snack down before you smack down.

3330
03:55:14,520 --> 03:55:15,720
I hate this.

3331
03:55:17,940 --> 03:55:19,020
Haven't I gone through enough?

3332
03:55:19,040 --> 03:55:20,280
For real though.

3333
03:55:21,020 --> 03:55:24,120
Like, it's mob rush after mob rush.

3334
03:55:24,420 --> 03:55:25,380
It's kind of horrible.

3335
03:55:28,780 --> 03:55:30,560
Like, why am I doing this again?

3336
03:55:30,660 --> 03:55:31,540
I just did it!

3337
03:55:31,620 --> 03:55:32,720
I just did one!

3338
03:55:47,020 --> 03:55:47,660
You good?

3339
03:55:47,980 --> 03:55:48,760
You good, bro?

3340
03:55:49,280 --> 03:55:49,640
Is it good?

3341
03:55:50,260 --> 03:55:51,380
Oh, okay, we got him.

3342
03:55:52,780 --> 03:55:53,400
Of course.

3343
03:55:53,800 --> 03:55:54,900
Of course, of course.

3344
03:55:56,320 --> 03:55:57,820
Of course, of course.

3345
03:56:05,410 --> 03:56:06,450
Oh, dang it.

3346
03:56:07,010 --> 03:56:08,030
Try the dodge.

3347
03:56:21,020 --> 03:56:23,180
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3348
03:56:23,860 --> 03:56:24,320
Sledgehammer.

3349
03:56:24,640 --> 03:56:25,380
No, no.

3350
03:56:25,780 --> 03:56:26,180
Give me...

3351
03:56:26,700 --> 03:56:29,680
Yeah, I know they say beggars can't be choosers, but they give me something else.

3352
03:56:31,560 --> 03:56:32,480
Let's get...

3353
03:56:34,830 --> 03:56:38,830
Dude, I think maybe two of those would be better than one full heal.

3354
03:56:39,490 --> 03:56:39,890
What's this?

3355
03:56:39,990 --> 03:56:40,870
Oh, another toolkit.

3356
03:56:41,390 --> 03:56:41,730
Oh, wait.

3357
03:56:41,830 --> 03:56:42,830
We have more toolkits.

3358
03:56:43,490 --> 03:56:44,310
Let's just heal.

3359
03:56:45,310 --> 03:56:45,730
What's it?

3360
03:56:45,730 --> 03:56:47,030
Oh, yeah, let's heal it.

3361
03:56:48,750 --> 03:56:50,390
There we go.

3362
03:56:53,470 --> 03:56:57,310
I know we're kind of, you know, at the mercy of...

3363
03:56:57,310 --> 03:56:57,770
What is that?

3364
03:56:57,950 --> 03:56:58,750
Oh, thank you.

3365
03:56:59,490 --> 03:57:01,590
The game, but...

3366
03:57:03,950 --> 03:57:05,690
Surely there's nothing else around here, right?

3367
03:57:05,810 --> 03:57:06,010
Yeah.

3368
03:57:08,650 --> 03:57:11,210
Yeah, heavy weapons will be, like, really difficult.

3369
03:57:11,810 --> 03:57:13,090
Just some floor pills.

3370
03:57:22,100 --> 03:57:22,760
Where's the...

3371
03:57:22,780 --> 03:57:23,360
Save.

3372
03:57:23,940 --> 03:57:23,940
Awesome.

3373
03:57:25,540 --> 03:57:25,540
Okay.

3374
03:57:26,060 --> 03:57:26,400
Alright.

3375
03:57:28,800 --> 03:57:29,660
Yeah, baby!

3376
03:57:30,420 --> 03:57:31,040
Okay, okay.

3377
03:57:33,460 --> 03:57:34,260
Enshrine.

3378
03:57:37,600 --> 03:57:37,960
Wait.

3379
03:57:38,360 --> 03:57:39,440
What is here, anyway?

3380
03:57:41,060 --> 03:57:42,980
A lot of stuff.

3381
03:57:43,480 --> 03:57:44,300
Like, everything.

3382
03:57:45,160 --> 03:57:46,180
Oh my gosh.

3383
03:57:47,360 --> 03:57:48,380
Everything is here.

3384
03:57:52,660 --> 03:57:57,980
I want to I want to I don't want to I don't want to sell anything

3385
03:58:05,470 --> 03:58:33,930
Wait I still don't know which one to get though Health or stamina I feel like if you have enough stamina You can just dodge forever We don't need health You know This one like I feel like we probably have Enough health items I'm gonna keep the Inari Zushi I'm gonna keep the She's thinking like a Souls player.

3386
03:58:36,550 --> 03:58:38,210
Stamina does kill stuff faster.

3387
03:58:38,390 --> 03:58:39,070
That's so true.

3388
03:58:40,690 --> 03:58:41,790
I probably won't use it.

3389
03:58:41,990 --> 03:58:42,890
I'm going to be honest.

3390
03:58:43,430 --> 03:58:44,870
I'm going to try and use the chocolate.

3391
03:58:45,430 --> 03:58:47,550
Wait, I figured I would have my arm.

3392
03:58:47,670 --> 03:58:50,210
Wait, if I don't have my arm, do I need my sanity?

3393
03:58:51,170 --> 03:58:51,730
Wait a second.

3394
03:58:51,850 --> 03:58:53,010
Did I play myself?

3395
03:58:55,190 --> 03:58:56,530
Did I just play myself?

3396
03:58:59,790 --> 03:59:00,210
What?

3397
03:59:01,490 --> 03:59:32,990
the chocolate no i don't have my arm in the final battle use the chocolate oh you do use it for focus that's so true that's so true i i thought i would have my why would you give me a yeti arm if i can't use it in the boss fight it's messed up that's messed up is wrong It's wrong!

3398
03:59:34,570 --> 03:59:35,790
Well, hold on.

3399
03:59:36,590 --> 03:59:37,230
We'll do this.

3400
03:59:39,150 --> 03:59:39,970
I will save.

3401
03:59:41,890 --> 03:59:42,950
And then I will pray.

3402
03:59:43,490 --> 03:59:50,630
If I find that I am needing more health, then I can load and I will do that.

3403
03:59:50,770 --> 03:59:51,250
You know what I mean?

3404
03:59:52,330 --> 03:59:54,810
I will just redo it.

3405
03:59:57,470 --> 03:59:59,810
More stamina, more stamina, more stamina.

3406
04:00:01,490 --> 04:00:03,830
We could get more sanity if we had enough Emma.

3407
04:00:04,130 --> 04:00:05,950
I feel like they should give you one in this room.

3408
04:00:07,850 --> 04:00:09,130
I can't even draw an Omamori.

3409
04:00:10,670 --> 04:00:13,490
And also, I'm going to change out my...

3410
04:00:17,130 --> 04:00:17,530
Omamori.

3411
04:00:17,990 --> 04:00:19,550
I'm going to change out from the...

3412
04:00:19,550 --> 04:00:21,570
Well, actually, let's see what the fight is like first.

3413
04:00:21,670 --> 04:00:22,150
Because I don't know.

3414
04:00:22,250 --> 04:00:23,470
There might be like...

3415
04:00:23,470 --> 04:00:24,310
What's it called?

3416
04:00:25,030 --> 04:00:26,530
Manicans that I have to fight to.

3417
04:00:27,370 --> 04:00:29,530
Freely decreases focus charging time.

3418
04:00:29,950 --> 04:00:30,810
Increase max stamina.

3419
04:00:31,090 --> 04:00:31,470
Okay, we'll...

3420
04:00:31,490 --> 04:00:33,070
I'll keep it for like that for now.

3421
04:00:37,350 --> 04:00:40,330
You carry your upgrades and stuff in the new game plus, so that's why they don't drop so many.

3422
04:00:40,430 --> 04:00:41,510
No, that makes total sense.

3423
04:00:42,830 --> 04:00:43,550
Makes sense.

3424
04:00:43,650 --> 04:00:44,170
I get it.

3425
04:00:44,390 --> 04:00:45,030
Well, I get it.

3426
04:00:45,090 --> 04:00:45,550
I get it.

3427
04:00:46,890 --> 04:00:48,050
I'm going to eat that.

3428
04:00:49,350 --> 04:00:50,890
I'm going to grab that.

3429
04:00:52,110 --> 04:00:52,830
The water...

3430
04:00:52,830 --> 04:00:53,290
Hold on.

3431
04:00:53,390 --> 04:00:55,710
I've never used the water, so I don't remember what it does.

3432
04:00:56,950 --> 04:00:57,870
It gives us sanity.

3433
04:00:58,010 --> 04:00:58,870
Okay, we'll do that.

3434
04:01:00,330 --> 04:01:01,290
Is that everything in here?

3435
04:01:03,210 --> 04:01:03,570
I...

3436
04:01:04,410 --> 04:01:04,970
I think.

3437
04:01:05,750 --> 04:01:06,330
It is.

3438
04:01:06,570 --> 04:01:06,850
Okay.

3439
04:01:15,880 --> 04:01:19,960
I can't tell if I'm at a boss fight yet or not.

3440
04:01:22,320 --> 04:01:22,880
Is this it?

3441
04:01:22,940 --> 04:01:23,280
Is it?

3442
04:01:26,240 --> 04:01:26,920
They're here?

3443
04:01:35,620 --> 04:01:36,540
Shimizu Hinako.

3444
04:01:37,120 --> 04:01:38,080
Shimizu Hinako.

3445
04:01:40,240 --> 04:01:40,880
So cute.

3446
04:01:40,980 --> 04:01:41,580
Wait, what is this?

3447
04:01:44,520 --> 04:02:01,220
yeah I'll take that and what else a bandage I think I'm good even more stuff there's more they give me more things I love these breezy naive slice of life copies the

3448
04:02:04,320 --> 04:02:18,100
dolls like tear take this knife wait another save huh huh okay I'm The bottom one is the save where I got stamina.

3449
04:02:18,600 --> 04:02:18,740
Okay.

3450
04:02:19,880 --> 04:02:24,000
I hope you know that Konami requires you to write a five-page essay on what you thought of the combat.

3451
04:02:24,140 --> 04:02:24,420
Yeah!

3452
04:02:29,800 --> 04:02:31,700
What I learned in...

3453
04:02:31,700 --> 04:02:34,260
What I learned in Silent Hill F is...

3454
04:02:34,260 --> 04:02:36,480
What I learned in Silent Hill F is...

3455
04:02:49,010 --> 04:02:51,670
Oh, she's going through where...

3456
04:02:51,670 --> 04:02:53,230
She did all the rituals and stuff.

3457
04:02:55,550 --> 04:03:01,910
Making my way downtown Walking slow Taking in all the sides

3458
04:03:05,110 --> 04:03:11,790
I love this montage Of like her going around Seeing everything

3459
04:03:15,300 --> 04:03:26,360
Maybe it's supposed to be more impactful Because it's actually Shimizu Hinako Seeing everything rather than just Hinako But I don't know.

3460
04:03:36,100 --> 04:03:37,400
It's the deal with the dogs.

3461
04:03:37,780 --> 04:03:39,060
So there's a fox tron.

3462
04:03:39,980 --> 04:03:40,620
Is this it?

3463
04:03:41,040 --> 04:03:42,080
Is this where we do the fight?

3464
04:03:48,830 --> 04:03:50,850
Or am I the minister?

3465
04:03:51,590 --> 04:03:53,990
Am I ordaining this marriage?

3466
04:03:58,770 --> 04:04:01,110
Is my sister the final boss?

3467
04:04:10,910 --> 04:04:11,450
Oh,

3468
04:04:25,200 --> 04:04:27,400
she's got the thing on her...

3469
04:04:27,400 --> 04:04:28,300
The brooch, though.

3470
04:04:33,420 --> 04:04:33,960
Are

3471
04:04:39,750 --> 04:04:43,070
those the red pills I've been taking?

3472
04:04:45,190 --> 04:04:46,270
Uh-oh.

3473
04:05:03,170 --> 04:05:04,930
Wait, should I have not been if...

3474
04:05:04,930 --> 04:05:06,510
Should I have not been taking those?

3475
04:05:06,930 --> 04:05:07,590
Oh, geez.

3476
04:05:09,090 --> 04:05:10,450
It's the pill's fault.

3477
04:05:14,570 --> 04:05:15,050
Rupro.

3478
04:05:22,090 --> 04:05:27,390
I know there's, like, conditions for, like, unlocking other parts of the game, like, the other endings.

3479
04:05:28,150 --> 04:05:32,010
I wonder if one of them is not taking the pills, like, not using them at all.

3480
04:05:34,410 --> 04:05:35,770
Oh my god.

3481
04:05:47,430 --> 04:05:47,910
Maybe?

3482
04:05:48,310 --> 04:05:49,270
No spoilers!

3483
04:05:52,790 --> 04:05:59,190
You're forced into this ending on your first playthrough.

3484
04:05:59,450 --> 04:06:01,690
Yeah, because you wouldn't know.

3485
04:06:05,370 --> 04:06:10,250
Oh my gosh, it's like those mists at theme parks when it's summertime.

3486
04:06:10,810 --> 04:06:12,310
It feels so good.

3487
04:06:17,080 --> 04:06:17,340
Oh!

3488
04:06:18,280 --> 04:06:18,300
Oh!

3489
04:06:18,300 --> 04:06:18,660
Oh!

3490
04:06:19,700 --> 04:06:19,940
Oh!

3491
04:06:20,800 --> 04:06:21,180
Oh!

3492
04:06:22,140 --> 04:06:22,200
Oh!

3493
04:06:29,170 --> 04:06:29,990
like screams?

3494
04:06:30,350 --> 04:06:31,410
That's so freaky.

3495
04:06:52,330 --> 04:06:54,670
You take the bill's chat disappears.

3496
04:06:55,290 --> 04:06:56,630
No, don't leave me.

3497
04:06:57,050 --> 04:06:57,910
I'll be so lonely.

3498
04:07:04,030 --> 04:07:05,170
Hinako, please.

3499
04:07:05,530 --> 04:07:05,910
Oh, wait.

3500
04:07:06,070 --> 04:07:06,850
We're already in a fight.

3501
04:07:07,110 --> 04:07:07,670
Oh, my God.

3502
04:07:08,190 --> 04:07:08,670
Shidomuku!

3503
04:07:09,270 --> 04:07:09,510
Whoa.

3504
04:07:12,650 --> 04:07:14,690
I've learned the art of the dodge.

3505
04:07:17,870 --> 04:07:18,350
Maybe.

3506
04:07:18,770 --> 04:07:18,970
Oh.

3507
04:07:19,630 --> 04:07:20,010
Ouch.

3508
04:07:22,970 --> 04:07:25,050
Oh, I pressed dodge.

3509
04:07:25,370 --> 04:07:26,150
And I did, baby.

3510
04:07:26,550 --> 04:07:26,950
Oh, ouch.

3511
04:07:27,050 --> 04:07:27,390
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3512
04:07:45,960 --> 04:07:46,440
Dang.

3513
04:07:46,640 --> 04:07:47,000
Ooi.

3514
04:07:47,600 --> 04:07:48,140
Wooy!

3515
04:07:49,680 --> 04:07:50,720
Oh, dang it.

3516
04:07:51,620 --> 04:07:53,320
I timed it all wrong.

3517
04:07:54,660 --> 04:07:55,780
Yeah, stab her.

3518
04:07:56,280 --> 04:07:56,420
Ouch.

3519
04:07:57,080 --> 04:07:58,760
And don't get stabbed yourself.

3520
04:08:00,080 --> 04:08:00,220
Woo!

3521
04:08:02,140 --> 04:08:04,080
Let's let her stamina...

3522
04:08:04,080 --> 04:08:04,660
Just kidding!

3523
04:08:09,580 --> 04:08:09,820
Oh.

3524
04:08:10,480 --> 04:08:11,180
Oh, oh, nice.

3525
04:08:15,100 --> 04:08:16,580
Yeah, aren't you gonna kill me?

3526
04:08:16,820 --> 04:08:17,140
Dummy?

3527
04:08:17,620 --> 04:08:19,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3528
04:08:26,380 --> 04:08:27,680
Oh, the flowers.

3529
04:08:45,040 --> 04:08:46,440
Ooh, we're getting into darkness.

3530
04:08:55,760 --> 04:08:56,320
Oh, my gosh.

3531
04:08:56,560 --> 04:08:57,080
So scary.

3532
04:08:57,480 --> 04:08:58,160
Oh, let me out.

3533
04:08:59,540 --> 04:09:00,100
Uh-oh.

3534
04:09:00,400 --> 04:09:00,740
Uh-oh.

3535
04:09:00,880 --> 04:09:01,360
Uh-oh.

3536
04:09:01,820 --> 04:09:02,200
Okay.

3537
04:09:02,940 --> 04:09:03,320
Um.

3538
04:09:03,560 --> 04:09:04,540
Oh, no, no.

3539
04:09:05,540 --> 04:09:06,020
Ouch!

3540
04:09:06,160 --> 04:09:07,220
Why didn't I dodge that?

3541
04:09:07,280 --> 04:09:07,880
I'm so stupid.

3542
04:09:12,990 --> 04:09:13,850
Wait, please.

3543
04:09:14,070 --> 04:09:14,430
Lock on.

3544
04:09:24,790 --> 04:09:25,810
Let's get away.

3545
04:09:26,030 --> 04:09:26,610
Oh, ouch.

3546
04:09:33,030 --> 04:09:33,510
Whoa!

3547
04:09:42,750 --> 04:09:43,950
Oh, it's like hurting me.

3548
04:09:44,050 --> 04:09:44,130
Ouch!

3549
04:09:44,490 --> 04:09:44,490
Ouch!

3550
04:09:44,690 --> 04:09:47,230
Where am I supposed to go?

3551
04:09:49,010 --> 04:09:50,450
Oh, you're supposed to...

3552
04:09:50,450 --> 04:09:51,390
Oh my...

3553
04:09:55,210 --> 04:09:56,090
Oh, what?

3554
04:09:56,690 --> 04:09:56,870
Oh!

3555
04:10:02,610 --> 04:10:03,050
Okay.

3556
04:10:03,630 --> 04:10:04,170
Let's go?

3557
04:10:11,730 --> 04:10:12,170
Ouch, ouch.

3558
04:10:12,370 --> 04:10:13,230
Oh my gosh.

3559
04:10:13,470 --> 04:10:14,010
Oh my gosh.

3560
04:10:16,650 --> 04:10:18,090
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3561
04:10:19,510 --> 04:10:21,170
The moveset is crazy!

3562
04:10:22,550 --> 04:10:23,010
Oh, geez.

3563
04:10:27,330 --> 04:10:28,370
More bandages, please?

3564
04:10:28,790 --> 04:10:30,250
Wait, I'm like healing too.

3565
04:10:55,390 --> 04:10:56,050
Oh, gosh!

3566
04:10:56,330 --> 04:10:56,590
Oh, gosh.

3567
04:11:00,580 --> 04:11:02,060
Sorry, I'm still taking the pills.

3568
04:11:13,590 --> 04:11:14,030
Ow!

3569
04:11:15,850 --> 04:11:16,450
Oh, wait.

3570
04:11:16,630 --> 04:11:17,830
Uh, uh, ah, ah!

3571
04:11:18,210 --> 04:11:19,370
Wait, do I just run here?

3572
04:11:19,550 --> 04:11:20,290
Oh my gosh, wait!

3573
04:11:20,470 --> 04:11:20,710
Ah!

3574
04:11:22,410 --> 04:11:23,870
I don't know what to do here!

3575
04:11:26,230 --> 04:11:27,450
I just die.

3576
04:11:27,630 --> 04:11:27,870
I just end

3577
04:11:33,560 --> 04:11:34,400
up...

3578
04:11:34,400 --> 04:11:35,520
You just run away?

3579
04:11:35,820 --> 04:11:36,020
Ugh.

3580
04:11:38,980 --> 04:11:41,320
I do end up, like, healing, though, which is kind of cool.

3581
04:11:44,020 --> 04:11:44,460
Oh, shoot.

3582
04:11:44,860 --> 04:11:45,360
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

3583
04:11:52,940 --> 04:11:54,060
Oh, oh, wait.

3584
04:11:54,920 --> 04:11:56,140
She's got my dodge.

3585
04:11:56,680 --> 04:11:58,220
Hey, you can't have my dodge.

3586
04:11:58,360 --> 04:11:59,320
It's, like, my dodge.

3587
04:12:01,440 --> 04:12:02,200
You can't have that.

3588
04:12:04,200 --> 04:12:05,680
I wish the camera angle...

3589
04:12:05,700 --> 04:12:06,860
wasn't so weird.

3590
04:12:12,180 --> 04:12:13,460
Why did I learn that move?

3591
04:12:13,680 --> 04:12:15,500
Oh, spinny arm, spinny arm.

3592
04:12:24,810 --> 04:12:27,150
Oh, I dodged right into her.

3593
04:12:27,230 --> 04:12:27,730
That's so funny.

3594
04:12:28,470 --> 04:12:29,210
It's not funny.

3595
04:12:29,630 --> 04:12:30,070
It's funny.

3596
04:12:31,570 --> 04:12:33,010
Isn't that, like, so quirky?

3597
04:12:37,190 --> 04:12:38,470
Wait, I have...

3598
04:12:38,470 --> 04:12:40,050
Okay, I have one weapon left.

3599
04:12:43,390 --> 04:12:43,950
Hey!

3600
04:12:47,310 --> 04:12:48,290
Okay, I'm running.

3601
04:12:48,870 --> 04:12:49,090
I'm...

3602
04:12:49,090 --> 04:12:49,190
Ah!

3603
04:12:49,510 --> 04:12:49,990
I'm running!

3604
04:12:50,230 --> 04:12:50,370
I'm running!

3605
04:12:50,590 --> 04:12:50,850
I'm running!

3606
04:12:52,050 --> 04:12:53,350
I don't know what to do!

3607
04:12:53,830 --> 04:12:54,630
I'm confused!

3608
04:12:55,190 --> 04:12:55,730
I'm running!

3609
04:12:56,130 --> 04:12:57,970
I'm- I don't know what to do!

3610
04:13:01,730 --> 04:13:03,430
Oh, If I get away farther.

3611
04:13:03,650 --> 04:13:04,290
Oh, I see.

3612
04:13:04,430 --> 04:13:04,510
I see.

3613
04:13:04,650 --> 04:13:04,810
I see.

3614
04:13:05,170 --> 04:13:05,390
Okay.

3615
04:13:16,060 --> 04:13:16,520
Ouch!

3616
04:13:25,580 --> 04:13:26,040
Ouchie!

3617
04:13:26,640 --> 04:13:26,700
Ouch!

3618
04:13:26,840 --> 04:13:26,920
Ouch!

3619
04:13:27,800 --> 04:13:28,260
Whoa!

3620
04:13:28,620 --> 04:13:29,320
My gosh!

3621
04:13:31,800 --> 04:13:34,620
Yeah, they're safe spots and noticing that not...

3622
04:13:35,220 --> 04:13:35,460
Like...

3623
04:13:35,460 --> 04:13:36,100
That...

3624
04:13:36,100 --> 04:13:37,240
Oh my god.

3625
04:13:46,360 --> 04:13:46,900
Please!

3626
04:13:48,520 --> 04:13:49,020
Ma'am!

3627
04:13:49,540 --> 04:13:50,480
I need you to...

3628
04:13:51,260 --> 04:13:51,800
Wait.

3629
04:13:52,960 --> 04:13:53,400
Is that it?

3630
04:13:53,880 --> 04:13:54,060
Oh!

3631
04:13:56,180 --> 04:13:57,040
Phase two?

3632
04:14:01,060 --> 04:14:01,700
Uh-oh.

3633
04:14:01,880 --> 04:14:02,000
Uh-oh.

3634
04:14:02,000 --> 04:14:04,920
Wait, I think the Fox guy is gonna be kind of angry at me.

3635
04:14:06,400 --> 04:14:06,740
Right.

3636
04:14:07,060 --> 04:14:07,500
Right.

3637
04:14:08,840 --> 04:14:10,440
He's gonna be like, you killed my wife!

3638
04:14:10,780 --> 04:14:11,820
You killed my wife!

3639
04:14:12,800 --> 04:14:13,400
Yeah,

3640
04:14:16,890 --> 04:14:17,550
feel that.

3641
04:14:22,830 --> 04:14:25,930
Oh my gosh, my trauma hearing these sounds.

3642
04:14:26,570 --> 04:14:28,710
Our crowbar is all...

3643
04:14:28,710 --> 04:14:29,430
Be love!

3644
04:14:31,510 --> 04:14:32,510
Wait, I have to fight these two.

3645
04:14:32,970 --> 04:14:34,950
Oh my god, please, no more!

3646
04:14:35,450 --> 04:14:36,030
Please!

3647
04:14:36,850 --> 04:14:37,250
Please!

3648
04:14:44,140 --> 04:14:45,520
Get me out of here.

3649
04:14:48,060 --> 04:14:48,980
I like how there's...

3650
04:14:48,980 --> 04:14:51,120
Are those pills all over the ground?

3651
04:14:51,680 --> 04:14:52,820
Wait, that's messed up.

3652
04:14:59,250 --> 04:15:01,610
Oh my god, there's pills everywhere!

3653
04:15:03,070 --> 04:15:03,770
Oh my gosh.

3654
04:15:10,700 --> 04:15:11,660
Wait, I'm lost.

3655
04:15:11,980 --> 04:15:12,740
Oh, just kidding.

3656
04:15:13,060 --> 04:15:13,720
Um, okay.

3657
04:15:20,730 --> 04:15:22,850
I kind of want to grab all of them.

3658
04:15:23,750 --> 04:15:27,990
really tempting it's so tempting

3659
04:15:31,610 --> 04:15:36,010
no way please let me say i can get run past okay good

3660
04:15:43,230 --> 04:15:47,290
oh my gosh we're running

3661
04:16:00,570 --> 04:16:01,750
Everything's falling apart.

3662
04:16:02,810 --> 04:16:03,530
Wait, what was that?

3663
04:16:04,470 --> 04:16:04,630
Oh.

3664
04:16:05,510 --> 04:16:06,610
I thought it was a letter.

3665
04:16:20,230 --> 04:16:21,050
Oh my gosh.

3666
04:16:22,530 --> 04:16:23,330
It's insanity.

3667
04:16:24,270 --> 04:16:24,810
Wait, am I just...

3668
04:16:24,810 --> 04:16:26,410
Am I just running in circles?

3669
04:16:29,830 --> 04:16:30,870
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3670
04:16:31,170 --> 04:16:31,330
Okay.

3671
04:16:32,050 --> 04:16:33,250
Oh, that scared me.

3672
04:16:35,890 --> 04:16:37,950
This guy's still trying to attack me while I'm running.

3673
04:16:39,090 --> 04:16:39,490
Oh

3674
04:16:53,340 --> 04:16:54,180
my gosh.

3675
04:16:54,560 --> 04:16:55,960
Wait, that's insane!

3676
04:16:58,680 --> 04:17:01,060
Oh, we're speeding now?

3677
04:17:05,900 --> 04:17:08,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

3678
04:17:09,860 --> 04:17:12,180
Wait, the visuals are so cool!

3679
04:17:17,440 --> 04:17:18,780
Like it's so stretched.

3680
04:17:21,520 --> 04:17:22,820
Massive pills.

3681
04:17:33,730 --> 04:17:36,210
500 FOV, me and Minecraft.

3682
04:17:42,760 --> 04:17:47,920
Why does the shrine have like a police alarm system?

3683
04:18:11,470 --> 04:18:12,470
Is this phase two?

3684
04:18:20,090 --> 04:18:20,450
What?

3685
04:18:35,770 --> 04:18:37,210
Oh, I got it!

3686
04:18:37,590 --> 04:18:38,030
Hippie!

3687
04:18:42,450 --> 04:18:46,890
I understand why they're like, no, no, you must play the game again.

3688
04:18:47,790 --> 04:18:48,470
No, no, no.

3689
04:18:48,890 --> 04:18:49,650
How many endings?

3690
04:18:49,790 --> 04:18:50,770
Wait, I think I asked this before.

3691
04:18:50,790 --> 04:18:52,990
I think people said like three endings or something.

3692
04:18:53,530 --> 04:18:55,410
My singletch face, thank you so much for the five.

3693
04:18:55,510 --> 04:18:56,530
Good to thank you.

3694
04:18:56,870 --> 04:18:57,050
Aw.

3695
04:19:00,130 --> 04:19:00,650
Four.

3696
04:19:01,110 --> 04:19:02,030
Four endings.

3697
04:19:07,220 --> 04:19:09,000
Four endings plus one joke ending.

3698
04:19:09,380 --> 04:19:09,760
Ah, okay.

3699
04:19:11,580 --> 04:19:12,740
I think people said the...

3700
04:19:12,740 --> 04:19:15,160
I think I remember what people said the joke ending was.

3701
04:19:25,910 --> 04:19:28,230
I feel like...

3702
04:19:29,110 --> 04:19:30,370
I feel like...

3703
04:19:32,070 --> 04:19:34,070
I can't give a proper...

3704
04:19:37,970 --> 04:19:38,570
Uh...

3705
04:19:38,570 --> 04:19:48,790
Not review, but my proper thoughts on the story itself, because I obviously have not seen like the other endings and the true ending, you know?

3706
04:19:52,990 --> 04:19:53,290
But...

3707
04:19:53,590 --> 04:19:57,070
I have seen many people complaining about...

3708
04:19:58,210 --> 04:20:00,070
The amount of combat...

3709
04:20:00,810 --> 04:20:01,830
And that I do understand.

3710
04:20:02,070 --> 04:20:32,330
and they won a four this game has a wonderful story but a lot of filler because you have to replay it a lot yeah it's fun watching it get lost with a gloom goblin thank you close credits scene add some context okay cool yeah I like the story but the fact that it's and I like You know,

3711
04:20:32,690 --> 04:20:34,990
obviously I've been like raving about the visuals.

3712
04:20:38,530 --> 04:20:55,470
Um, I definitely felt like the combat would get more cumbersome, just kind of like, okay, like this, this again, then like, scary, you know, but...

3713
04:21:01,770 --> 04:21:03,350
I don't mind being...

3714
04:21:03,350 --> 04:21:06,330
I don't mind playing a game multiple times to get all the endings.

3715
04:21:06,450 --> 04:21:07,150
Don't get me wrong.

3716
04:21:09,070 --> 04:21:14,870
Yonegawa-Niori Kenkei-Honbue, Kenkawa-Nioui Kenkawa-nui-jian-no-higisha-to-omowa-shiki-joice-neighborhood.

3717
04:21:15,150 --> 04:21:18,130
One of the men, one of the one.

3718
04:21:18,130 --> 04:21:20,250
One of the men, Kenkei-Norui-Kenkei-honbue.

3719
04:21:20,610 --> 04:21:21,630
One of the people, Kenkei-Honbue.

3720
04:21:21,770 --> 04:21:28,770
One of the victims are used, but the city's history is not found to be found.

3721
04:21:30,790 --> 04:21:34,150
Kenkei-Honbueh-higisha-hikishe-hikishe-hikishe-hikishe 20 years.

3722
04:21:36,440 --> 04:21:37,980
His height is 160 cm.

3723
04:21:41,380 --> 04:21:44,540
The dark line.

3724
04:21:44,720 --> 04:21:44,900
The dark blue.

3725
04:21:48,200 --> 04:21:50,480
It is okay.

3726
04:21:50,480 --> 04:21:50,480
Oh,

3727
04:21:54,600 --> 04:21:55,180
her parents!

3728
04:22:04,540 --> 04:22:05,940
Change!

3729
04:22:35,130 --> 04:22:37,310
What has said in her 20s?

3730
04:22:38,670 --> 04:22:45,590
Love the setting, the story and the characters, but as someone who enjoys Souls games, the combat is not what I wanted out of Silent Hill.

3731
04:22:45,770 --> 04:22:46,830
Yeah, I get that.

3732
04:22:46,930 --> 04:22:47,510
I get that.

3733
04:22:48,310 --> 04:22:50,370
Silent Hill F was the friends we killed a lot.

3734
04:22:50,390 --> 04:23:02,720
the way it's a studio that did your 3d yeah it is it is they're amazing they're so they're so awesome

3735
04:23:24,990 --> 04:23:39,050
um watch the other endings if you don't plan on playing again i asked about that before and people said that thing little things change throughout the story so i don't think it's really a thing just watch the ending, you know?

3736
04:23:39,770 --> 04:23:42,650
Perhaps let's not do ibuprofen together.

3737
04:23:52,170 --> 04:23:54,190
This soundtrack is so beautiful.

3738
04:23:54,530 --> 04:23:55,190
Oh my gosh.

3739
04:23:59,290 --> 04:24:10,250
So, I, going back to that other super chat that was saying like, you know, um, the gameplay is not what you wanted from a Silent Hill.

3740
04:24:10,710 --> 04:24:19,790
I actually, honestly, when I, I was playing this, it's not the combat itself that bothered me so much.

3741
04:24:20,590 --> 04:24:25,070
Surprisingly, it was actually the amount of it.

3742
04:24:26,310 --> 04:24:28,670
I just don't like playing video games.

3743
04:24:29,070 --> 04:24:29,650
No, just kidding.

3744
04:24:31,430 --> 04:24:34,070
I think I just don't want to play video games.

3745
04:24:36,370 --> 04:24:38,690
I think it was like...

3746
04:24:40,770 --> 04:24:42,230
Yeah, they should be able to...

3747
04:24:42,230 --> 04:24:43,670
They should let you run more.

3748
04:24:44,330 --> 04:24:53,270
The fact that I was forced into some of those fights with, like, the most annoying of creatures is what is so frustrating about it.

3749
04:24:55,270 --> 04:24:56,310
But, um...

3750
04:24:57,530 --> 04:24:58,050
But...

3751
04:24:58,050 --> 04:24:59,830
Where was I going with this?

3752
04:25:00,050 --> 04:25:07,270
Oh, I mentioned this before, but I saw someone tweet about how, like, I played on story mode.

3753
04:25:08,270 --> 04:25:11,250
And, you know, it was still challenging, you know?

3754
04:25:12,430 --> 04:25:13,950
Too much titty monster.

3755
04:25:14,470 --> 04:25:16,110
I never thought I would say that before.

3756
04:25:17,950 --> 04:25:19,310
The gauntlets kind of sucked.

3757
04:25:20,050 --> 04:25:20,970
Yeah, yeah.

3758
04:25:24,730 --> 04:25:28,230
Resident Evil 9, Silent Hill, F...

3759
04:25:29,510 --> 04:25:29,990
But...

3760
04:25:29,990 --> 04:25:30,750
Bust...

3761
04:25:30,750 --> 04:25:31,430
God, wait, what?

3762
04:25:32,070 --> 04:25:34,870
I feel like we needed some ranged weapons.

3763
04:25:35,030 --> 04:25:35,590
I'm not gonna lie.

3764
04:25:36,290 --> 04:25:36,870
That's what I meant.

3765
04:25:36,970 --> 04:25:38,770
The amount of combat, not really the combat itself.

3766
04:25:38,970 --> 04:25:39,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3767
04:25:40,770 --> 04:25:42,210
Congrats on adding another completed game.

3768
04:25:42,230 --> 04:25:42,730
to the list.

3769
04:25:42,950 --> 04:25:43,550
Oh, thank you.

3770
04:25:43,670 --> 04:25:44,010
That's right.

3771
04:25:44,170 --> 04:25:44,510
You're right.

3772
04:25:48,570 --> 04:25:49,370
Huara-u!

3773
04:25:49,910 --> 04:25:50,950
Welcome to Bamboo Chef.

3774
04:25:51,070 --> 04:25:52,050
Thank you so much.

3775
04:25:52,210 --> 04:25:53,150
Thank you, thank you.

3776
04:25:53,690 --> 04:25:54,410
Like a gun.

3777
04:25:54,690 --> 04:25:55,670
Yeah, we need a gun.

3778
04:25:56,210 --> 04:25:59,290
We need to not go to go full American.

3779
04:26:00,810 --> 04:26:01,790
Red, white, and blue.

3780
04:26:06,900 --> 04:26:08,880
I feel like I could think of something.

3781
04:26:10,320 --> 04:26:10,700
I don't know.

3782
04:26:11,060 --> 04:26:12,420
Not a gun, per se.

3783
04:26:13,240 --> 04:26:18,520
Maybe like super powered slingshot i don't know it's it's fantasy

3784
04:26:22,640 --> 04:26:28,120
but uh i guess a bow would work yeah yeah a flamethrower easy

3785
04:26:32,510 --> 04:26:42,590
but yeah um i played on story mode and it was still quite challenging i feel like there's a bit of a

3786
04:26:45,610 --> 04:27:07,870
gamer i'm uh so i feel like with someone i feel like for a lot of people they could probably get uh pretty tied up in some of these parts of the game phil thank you so much for the 50 gift thank you thank you thank you so much

3787
04:27:12,370 --> 04:27:16,670
re4 has a lot of combat but it's way better and a lot more gratifying because he get guns.

3788
04:27:16,930 --> 04:27:17,790
Yeah, guards.

3789
04:27:18,830 --> 04:27:20,030
Thank you for the warning, though.

3790
04:27:20,730 --> 04:27:24,170
Opening cutscene and New Game Plus changes a good amount if you want to taste...

3791
04:27:24,170 --> 04:27:24,810
Oh, really?

3792
04:27:25,570 --> 04:27:26,470
Good job, Minto.

3793
04:27:26,910 --> 04:27:30,050
And New Game Plus skips the middle section entirely.

3794
04:27:30,470 --> 04:27:32,330
So it takes about five hours to run to the end.

3795
04:27:32,450 --> 04:27:33,070
Oh, really?

3796
04:27:33,190 --> 04:27:34,890
But the combat gauntlet is still there.

3797
04:27:37,490 --> 04:27:38,670
New Game Plus!

3798
04:27:39,350 --> 04:27:39,670
Oh, sorry.

3799
04:27:39,770 --> 04:27:41,790
I didn't see what the achievements were.

3800
04:27:42,670 --> 04:28:10,870
I played on hard because I wanted a challenge, but I regretted that in the end came such a slog see i that's what i feel like i feel like oh my gosh would you even need to play this game on hard because it would just be so much no recommend silent hill 3 that's actually i have played silent hill 3 i think that was my first silent hill i'm not gonna lie um but i played it when i was a wee wisp so

3801
04:28:16,570 --> 04:28:48,350
I don't quite remember a lot of it I remember like obviously Heather that was Heather right am I getting her name right I remember I remember in the like going to the amusement park area I remember of course you started the mall main issue is the force combat yes yeah early game you can run away no problem but the end you have to you have eight back-to-back force combat arenas with mini bosses you have to get through yeah yeah Watch the ending on YouTube right now.

3802
04:28:48,790 --> 04:28:49,270
No.

3803
04:28:57,880 --> 04:29:07,720
Oh, I remember the one room you go into in Silent Hill 3 that would lock you in there and you just die and you don't know not to go into that room.

3804
04:29:08,160 --> 04:29:10,820
And I really thought they were going to do that in this game.

3805
04:29:11,100 --> 04:29:13,640
So I would like go into a room and be like,

3806
04:29:19,510 --> 04:29:23,390
yeah, the mirror, the mirror, the mirror.

3807
04:29:23,470 --> 04:29:39,630
room yes oh my gosh i really thought they were gonna do it though i was like don't trust anyone don't trust anyone i've ever played the silent hill the room i have not played that one actually

3808
04:29:43,390 --> 04:29:51,890
well i didn't need the extra health woohoo look at that they have the pills there let's mess up

3809
04:30:00,150 --> 04:30:01,770
Coming home to roost.

3810
04:30:02,430 --> 04:30:04,530
Drown in a bottomless pit of self-doubt.

3811
04:30:05,710 --> 04:30:05,730
Mood?

3812
04:30:07,930 --> 04:30:09,010
Just watching the endings.

3813
04:30:09,430 --> 04:30:13,630
Won't give you proper context since a lot of info is revealed and recontextualize along the way.

3814
04:30:13,870 --> 04:30:15,050
The Ryukishi special!

3815
04:30:17,690 --> 04:30:25,870
They're gonna be like, here's some notes and only believe the stuff that's written and read.

3816
04:30:31,180 --> 04:30:45,440
wow it's completely taken over we can watch the we can watch the what's it called I like how I click continue it doesn't even give me the option to load one of my older saves

3817
04:30:49,040 --> 04:30:59,680
lost in the fog stronger enemies and less resources for people looking for tense combat there's already a hard mode and then you're going to give like the super hard mode.

3818
04:31:00,800 --> 04:31:01,260
Insane.

3819
04:31:02,740 --> 04:31:04,480
But we can watch the opening cutscene.

3820
04:31:09,650 --> 04:31:11,190
And I did do the puzzles on hard.

3821
04:31:14,130 --> 04:31:15,970
most of them were easy.

3822
04:31:16,950 --> 04:31:18,870
View endings tells you what you need to do.

3823
04:31:19,590 --> 04:31:21,010
Wait, tells you what you need to do.

3824
04:31:21,390 --> 04:31:21,710
It does.

3825
04:31:26,210 --> 04:31:28,810
The game needs like two more unique enemy types.

3826
04:31:28,990 --> 04:31:30,010
I agree.

3827
04:31:32,270 --> 04:32:21,770
I I seeing I do I think it's fun that you see the mannequins change like they become more like bloomed and that's kind of cool but wasn't there one unless it's like a boss for one of the other endings but there was there was there was an enemy I remember seeing before the game came out that had like flowers blooming from it and it wait one okay thank you so much for that look at super why thank you thank you so much

3828
04:32:24,860 --> 04:32:34,660
the steel case cover let me see let me see what the steel case cover was

3829
04:32:42,520 --> 04:32:48,420
Silent Hill F Steelcase Cover Uh

3830
04:32:51,500 --> 04:33:13,820
No I don't think so Um I remember it was It was so beautiful That's why hold on Silent Hill F Monsters I'm just gonna look it up It was like so pretty though I remember it had like I think like bulky arms and like flowers growing from it.

3831
04:33:14,600 --> 04:33:15,820
I was like very pink.

3832
04:33:18,700 --> 04:33:21,000
The short game has a really good flower enemy.

3833
04:33:21,140 --> 04:33:22,020
Maybe it's that then.

3834
04:33:22,880 --> 04:33:25,000
Like I feel like the arms were like wrapped.

3835
04:33:25,600 --> 04:33:29,100
Like they had like not like like black tape around it or something.

3836
04:33:29,120 --> 04:33:30,500
I might be making that up though.

3837
04:33:30,880 --> 04:33:32,060
Don't quote me on that.

3838
04:33:33,180 --> 04:33:34,200
Wait I found it!

3839
04:33:34,400 --> 04:33:35,240
The Sakura head!

3840
04:33:36,020 --> 04:33:36,300
Wait!

3841
04:33:36,660 --> 04:33:36,980
Yeah!

3842
04:33:37,620 --> 04:33:39,580
Sakura, I guess it's called Sakura head.

3843
04:33:40,320 --> 04:33:42,060
Wait, where is that?

3844
04:33:44,300 --> 04:33:45,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3845
04:33:50,520 --> 04:33:53,020
Silent Hill's short message.

3846
04:33:55,160 --> 04:33:55,800
Timeless!

3847
04:33:56,720 --> 04:33:58,140
Stay cringe and free.

3848
04:33:58,720 --> 04:33:59,840
Happy birthday!

3849
04:34:00,280 --> 04:34:01,280
Thank you so much.

3850
04:34:01,440 --> 04:34:01,740
I'm sorry.

3851
04:34:01,920 --> 04:34:03,620
I will be streaming on your birthday tomorrow.

3852
04:34:04,320 --> 04:34:05,520
Happy, happy birthday!

3853
04:34:06,260 --> 04:34:07,220
Happy, happy birthday!

3854
04:34:09,060 --> 04:34:11,180
Silent Hill is a short message.

3855
04:34:11,500 --> 04:34:12,200
Oh, dang it.

3856
04:34:12,220 --> 04:34:27,000
it i was really looking forward to seeing it it's from an entirely different game i'm such an idiot me not doing my research wait i think i remember the short message was like

3857
04:34:36,210 --> 04:34:42,030
i think i remember it was like all the notes and stuff right or whatever

3858
04:34:45,230 --> 04:34:51,490
and there was just like you're ugly you're stupid the bullying messages, right?

3859
04:34:54,830 --> 04:34:56,130
Yeah, a lot of notes.

3860
04:34:56,350 --> 04:34:58,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, okay.

3861
04:35:00,610 --> 04:35:03,810
Okay, I definitely did not play that, obviously.

3862
04:35:04,350 --> 04:35:07,590
Dang, but I kind of want to play it just to see Sakura had.

3863
04:35:08,650 --> 04:35:10,490
Such a pretty design.

3864
04:35:11,130 --> 04:35:13,810
It's like so, so, so beautiful.

3865
04:35:16,610 --> 04:35:17,050
Okay.

3866
04:35:18,090 --> 04:35:19,870
So, wait, didn't take the red capsules?

3867
04:35:20,110 --> 04:35:22,320
Purified the sacred sword or didn't obtain it?

3868
04:35:23,390 --> 04:35:24,250
I don't remember that.

3869
04:35:24,650 --> 04:35:26,170
Obtain the Agura Nohotei Sama.

3870
04:35:27,770 --> 04:35:29,310
Didn't take the red capsules.

3871
04:35:30,010 --> 04:35:32,010
Obtain the unpurified sacred sword.

3872
04:35:32,210 --> 04:35:33,830
There's a sacred sword.

3873
04:35:37,050 --> 04:35:39,150
Complete two different full endings.

3874
04:35:39,390 --> 04:35:40,290
Mystery, mystery, mystery.

3875
04:35:40,750 --> 04:35:42,710
Oh, this is the...

3876
04:35:42,710 --> 04:35:43,690
This is the...

3877
04:35:43,690 --> 04:35:45,870
Listen to all the UFO radio broadcasts.

3878
04:35:45,890 --> 04:35:46,750
There were broadcasts?

3879
04:35:46,990 --> 04:35:49,850
Found all three of the great space invasion movie posters in order.

3880
04:35:50,410 --> 04:35:57,090
After listening to the UFO radio broadcast, found the great space invasion movie review after fulfilling the conditions above.

3881
04:35:57,190 --> 04:35:58,570
This is like the joke ending, right?

3882
04:35:59,950 --> 04:36:01,210
Where like, it's space.

3883
04:36:02,570 --> 04:36:04,590
The sacred sword doesn't show up until New Game Plus.

3884
04:36:04,690 --> 04:36:05,050
Ah!

3885
04:36:05,470 --> 04:36:06,290
That makes sense then.

3886
04:36:06,730 --> 04:36:07,710
The Ibo ending.

3887
04:36:07,890 --> 04:36:09,030
Yeah, UFO hunting.

3888
04:36:09,670 --> 04:36:10,950
Space Wars ending.

3889
04:36:12,810 --> 04:36:12,970
Oka.

3890
04:36:13,570 --> 04:36:17,370
UFO, UFO, UFO, UFO is the true ending, I believe.

3891
04:36:17,930 --> 04:36:19,410
Okay, let's watch this then.

3892
04:36:21,990 --> 04:36:23,410
We'll go with the Navy.

3893
04:36:27,610 --> 04:36:30,430
You full ending, real ending.

3894
04:36:31,030 --> 04:36:31,470
The real.

3895
04:36:34,310 --> 04:36:43,270
I'd be honest, it's been a couple weeks since we saw the opening scene before, so...

3896
04:36:43,270 --> 04:36:48,210
I don't quite remember what will be different, but...

3897
04:36:48,210 --> 04:36:51,630
I'm going to eat some chips, though.

3898
04:37:05,090 --> 04:37:10,270
I guess this is good though to rewatch kind of everything though, right?

3899
04:37:11,230 --> 04:37:12,430
She's got the brooch!

3900
04:37:14,590 --> 04:37:15,730
What does that do?

3901
04:37:16,130 --> 04:37:17,190
What does the brooch do?

3902
04:37:17,930 --> 04:37:19,390
What does the brooch do?

3903
04:37:26,170 --> 04:37:28,730
You can open new boxes.

3904
04:37:31,090 --> 04:37:32,650
Open some doors that were locked before.

3905
04:37:41,430 --> 04:37:46,790
Sorry, I meet

3906
04:37:55,160 --> 04:37:55,600
my trips.

3907
04:37:56,460 --> 04:37:57,680
I'll give it to you.

3908
04:38:14,350 --> 04:38:37,950
I love how this like song sounds so silent hill but also obviously the setting is in Japan so it's Japanese too but like just the guitar strumming is so it's so good yeah they nailed it like

3909
04:38:46,810 --> 04:38:51,850
you hear this and you think it's a Silent Hill song it's so good I love it

3910
04:38:57,050 --> 04:39:07,930
sorry can you hear me crunching sorry I'm eating some veggie chips I basically have like a giant bag of them

3911
04:39:17,850 --> 04:39:32,410
oh my gosh wait I just realized I was so concerned with eating earlier I forgot to do the mood lighting on on myself I'm sorry just notice I forgot gotta

3912
04:39:44,140 --> 04:39:45,240
save there

3913
04:39:54,390 --> 04:40:10,430
whoa I also think it's pretty stinky that you have to fight the dad again I guess well and you don't even get to kill it essentially just walks away

3914
04:40:20,330 --> 04:40:21,910
Wait, wasn't her face?

3915
04:40:22,970 --> 04:40:23,510
Where's her face?

3916
04:40:45,200 --> 04:40:48,040
Oh, yeah, her mom went after her before.

3917
04:40:51,760 --> 04:40:52,160
Wow.

3918
04:40:52,880 --> 04:40:56,440
Oh, yeah, the mom chases you the first time.

3919
04:40:58,700 --> 04:40:59,180
Huh.

3920
04:41:00,600 --> 04:41:01,680
This scene is so stressful.

3921
04:41:01,900 --> 04:41:02,590
It is, yeah.

3922
04:41:04,580 --> 04:41:05,820
That's, okay.

3923
04:41:06,240 --> 04:41:20,940
That's like, that's, it's subtle enough to where, like, you have to kind of be like, wait, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh, that's cool.

3924
04:41:21,120 --> 04:41:22,020
I like it, I like it.

3925
04:41:22,880 --> 04:41:24,640
You can also read about the final boss in your journal now.

3926
04:41:24,780 --> 04:41:25,080
Oh, really?

3927
04:41:25,540 --> 04:41:26,020
Oh, wait.

3928
04:41:31,800 --> 04:41:32,320
This.

3929
04:41:33,540 --> 04:41:34,840
Wait, I saw you.

3930
04:41:35,180 --> 04:41:36,280
I saw you.

3931
04:41:37,260 --> 04:41:37,780
I...

3932
04:41:38,520 --> 04:41:39,560
Where'd you go?

3933
04:41:39,760 --> 04:41:40,120
You!

3934
04:41:41,740 --> 04:41:42,000
You!

3935
04:41:43,920 --> 04:41:44,440
You!

3936
04:41:45,340 --> 04:41:47,540
The pain of my existence.

3937
04:41:52,870 --> 04:41:55,250
The monster that my father turned into.

3938
04:41:55,710 --> 04:41:59,590
It acts the same way he did when he let his anger get the best of him.

3939
04:41:59,650 --> 04:42:03,510
It was the curse of fatherhood that made my dad appear human.

3940
04:42:04,150 --> 04:42:07,330
This form, his true form, must have been hidden underneath all along.

3941
04:42:09,710 --> 04:42:11,710
The monster that my mother turned into.

3942
04:42:12,290 --> 04:42:14,530
Not even sure she realized what happened to her.

3943
04:42:15,070 --> 04:42:17,030
Always being humiliated and abused.

3944
04:42:17,190 --> 04:42:18,770
Her twisted ideal of happiness.

3945
04:42:19,310 --> 04:42:22,210
There's no way that she was a human to begin with.

3946
04:42:22,850 --> 04:42:25,590
Wait, where's the final box?

3947
04:42:25,930 --> 04:42:26,630
Under Dark Shrine?

3948
04:42:29,770 --> 04:42:31,230
Oh, teddy monster.

3949
04:42:31,590 --> 04:42:32,930
Wait, I don't see it.

3950
04:42:37,270 --> 04:42:38,390
I'll have to walk out of it.

3951
04:42:40,010 --> 04:42:40,090
Ah.

3952
04:42:43,660 --> 04:42:49,620
An intimidating monster that appears in Shidomuku, a traditional white wedding kimono.

3953
04:42:50,360 --> 04:42:53,500
It uses their grand fox arm to compel others to obey.

3954
04:42:54,340 --> 04:42:56,780
It looks down on me and denies my existence.

3955
04:42:57,740 --> 04:43:00,640
But at the same time, it pities me like it thinks it's better than...

3956
04:43:00,640 --> 04:43:01,480
It thinks it's better.

3957
04:43:01,500 --> 04:43:02,440
Better than me or something.

3958
04:43:03,300 --> 04:43:04,360
Don't look down on me.

3959
04:43:04,600 --> 04:43:05,420
You're no better.

3960
04:43:08,640 --> 04:43:11,120
The final boss is marriage.

3961
04:43:12,340 --> 04:43:14,180
Oh my god.

3962
04:43:14,520 --> 04:43:16,860
Wait, are all the portraits messed up still?

3963
04:43:18,340 --> 04:43:18,800
Oh, wait.

3964
04:43:19,020 --> 04:43:19,280
Yeah.

3965
04:43:19,860 --> 04:43:20,440
Oh, no.

3966
04:43:21,100 --> 04:43:23,020
No, they're back to normal.

3967
04:43:28,410 --> 04:43:29,550
Marriage hate!

3968
04:43:30,250 --> 04:43:31,010
Marriage hate!

3969
04:43:40,200 --> 04:43:41,700
Well, thank you, guys.

3970
04:43:41,720 --> 04:43:43,080
Guys, I'll decide.

3971
04:43:43,440 --> 04:43:45,940
Maybe eventually I'll be kind of like, I'm so curious.

3972
04:43:46,540 --> 04:43:49,260
Obviously, if I play it on my own time, I'll play it on my own time.

3973
04:43:49,480 --> 04:43:52,220
But there might be like, I don't have time.

3974
04:43:52,340 --> 04:43:53,260
And I'm like, I'm so curious.

3975
04:43:53,440 --> 04:43:57,620
I want to, I want to experience the other ending.

3976
04:43:58,100 --> 04:43:58,760
So, oh, sorry.

3977
04:43:59,720 --> 04:44:02,640
Never say never about me doing the other ones.

3978
04:44:02,780 --> 04:44:03,960
You know, it might just be a while though.

3979
04:44:04,320 --> 04:44:05,880
Dargo, thank you so much.

3980
04:44:05,920 --> 04:44:09,220
Way to kick hash and add another winner to your list.

3981
04:44:09,520 --> 04:44:10,240
Thank you.

3982
04:44:12,520 --> 04:44:15,300
Thank you so much for the for the akasuba.

3983
04:44:15,960 --> 04:44:16,520
Thank you.

3984
04:44:17,280 --> 04:44:18,720
Is that a gummy worm in there?

3985
04:44:24,620 --> 04:44:26,820
I had to take a break before coming back.

3986
04:44:27,140 --> 04:44:27,520
Understandable.

3987
04:44:28,520 --> 04:44:31,520
There's definitely some compilations on YouTube that summarize the different endings.

3988
04:44:31,860 --> 04:44:32,780
I believe that too.

3989
04:44:32,900 --> 04:44:33,480
I believe it.

3990
04:44:33,940 --> 04:44:35,560
But this was a lot of fun.

3991
04:44:37,200 --> 04:44:41,700
I did, like I said, ultimately I enjoyed it despite the frustration.

3992
04:44:41,720 --> 04:44:42,380
Rating bits.

3993
04:44:42,880 --> 04:44:43,840
Ultimately, I thought it was fine.

3994
04:44:44,340 --> 04:44:45,420
So, ah, fake deal.

3995
04:44:45,520 --> 04:44:47,320
Thank you also for the Akashima.

3996
04:44:47,920 --> 04:44:48,660
It's a great deal.

3997
04:44:48,780 --> 04:44:50,080
It's all those endless mom medals.

3998
04:44:50,340 --> 04:44:51,260
Thank you.

3999
04:44:52,520 --> 04:44:54,740
Thank you so much.

4000
04:44:54,920 --> 04:44:55,300
Thank you.

4001
04:44:55,720 --> 04:44:58,000
There's an achievement for beating Shinomuku without dying.

4002
04:44:58,520 --> 04:44:58,920
I wonder.

4003
04:44:59,120 --> 04:45:00,140
Wait, but I did die.

4004
04:45:01,200 --> 04:45:02,300
And then I was brought back.

4005
04:45:02,440 --> 04:45:02,740
Dang.

4006
04:45:05,580 --> 04:45:06,820
Unless that didn't count.

4007
04:45:06,980 --> 04:45:08,840
I did get three achievement.

4008
04:45:08,920 --> 04:45:11,040
Let me see if I don't think I got it though.

4009
04:45:21,140 --> 04:45:29,380
I can't actually these are all so like these are so no I don't think I got it

4010
04:45:34,970 --> 04:45:46,290
it's funny because you can actually die a few times eventually they revive you with 99 pills wait if you were doing a pillless run would that ruin it that would be horrible

4011
04:45:50,700 --> 04:46:19,000
wait that would be the worst imagine you get through the whole game taking no pills and then you just suck at the boss and they're like shoving it down your throat that would be the worst how many completed games are we at I guys I need to lock in I just I'm gonna say that now we're not doing so hot and by we it's me I'm not doing so hot.

4012
04:46:19,980 --> 04:46:21,280
Wait, open the...

4013
04:46:21,280 --> 04:46:21,660
Open.

4014
04:46:22,580 --> 04:46:24,180
Why won't you open my document?

4015
04:46:26,840 --> 04:46:27,960
Play the games.

4016
04:46:28,140 --> 04:46:28,620
There we go.

4017
04:46:30,260 --> 04:46:30,940
Um...

4018
04:46:30,940 --> 04:46:31,460
10...

4019
04:46:31,460 --> 04:46:31,760
Oh, no.

4020
04:46:32,040 --> 04:46:32,820
We're 11.

4021
04:46:33,660 --> 04:46:36,060
November 1st, 2025.

4022
04:46:36,480 --> 04:46:38,260
Silent Hill F.

4023
04:46:38,820 --> 04:46:39,680
We'll take it.

4024
04:46:40,320 --> 04:46:41,660
We got an ending.

4025
04:46:41,880 --> 04:46:42,600
We'll take it.

4026
04:46:43,620 --> 04:46:44,360
Um...

4027
04:46:47,520 --> 04:46:58,400
I need, oh gosh, why doesn't Google Sheets, you know how like in Excel you can highlight a bunch of lines and it will tell you how many there are?

4028
04:46:58,800 --> 04:47:12,480
Like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, nineteen games I need to complete.

4029
04:47:17,120 --> 04:47:18,340
I need to complete.

4030
04:47:18,540 --> 04:47:20,700
We could probably do some, like, one-offs, you know?

4031
04:47:22,280 --> 04:47:22,860
Maybe.

4032
04:47:25,200 --> 04:47:25,860
I think.

4033
04:47:26,600 --> 04:47:28,840
We could do some, like, one-off games.

4034
04:47:30,720 --> 04:47:32,720
Time to start marathoning two-hour-long games.

4035
04:47:33,180 --> 04:47:33,740
Exactly, exactly.

4036
04:47:36,520 --> 04:47:37,100
So.

4037
04:47:39,140 --> 04:47:41,360
I have it at 33 completed.

4038
04:47:41,840 --> 04:47:42,260
17 remaining.

4039
04:47:47,740 --> 04:47:48,080
Really?

4040
04:47:48,840 --> 04:47:49,420
What?

4041
04:47:50,480 --> 04:47:54,920
We must compare our lists.

4042
04:47:58,500 --> 04:48:02,240
Tyre plays some visual novels and hold the fast forward button.

4043
04:48:03,940 --> 04:48:05,380
Google Sheets does count.

4044
04:48:05,520 --> 04:48:06,160
Look at the bottom right.

4045
04:48:07,220 --> 04:48:10,200
No, it literally is not showing any number for me.

4046
04:48:11,460 --> 04:48:12,640
Here, I'll show you my list.

4047
04:48:13,340 --> 04:48:14,000
I'll show you my list.

4048
04:48:14,120 --> 04:48:16,800
I'll even show you that there's no number.

4049
04:48:17,820 --> 04:48:18,060
Wait.

4050
04:48:20,020 --> 04:48:22,740
Oh wait, why did it just show up?

4051
04:48:25,820 --> 04:48:27,540
Oh my gosh, it did.

4052
04:48:28,040 --> 04:48:30,660
I adjusted my screen and it showed up.

4053
04:48:30,900 --> 04:48:31,720
I adjusted the window.

4054
04:48:32,200 --> 04:48:33,660
But anyway, I'll send you my...

4055
04:48:33,660 --> 04:48:35,920
Here's my list that I have.

4056
04:48:38,720 --> 04:48:40,020
Perhaps I missed some.

4057
04:48:40,480 --> 04:48:41,520
You can tell me on Twitter.

4058
04:48:41,720 --> 04:48:44,020
You can yell at me and be like...

4059
04:48:44,700 --> 04:48:45,160
Me too!

4060
04:48:45,440 --> 04:48:48,340
You actually did this one too.

4061
04:48:50,300 --> 04:48:51,460
This is my list.

4062
04:48:52,000 --> 04:48:53,600
It's so organized, isn't it?

4063
04:48:54,500 --> 04:48:54,940
Homete.

4064
04:48:55,200 --> 04:48:57,800
Praise me for being so organized.

4065
04:48:58,640 --> 04:49:00,160
Sly Cooper Games are chill and easy to beat.

4066
04:49:00,500 --> 04:49:02,500
Not quite one-off, but definitely worth looking at.

4067
04:49:02,740 --> 04:49:03,940
Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.

4068
04:49:06,880 --> 04:49:07,340
Harvester!

4069
04:49:10,720 --> 04:49:11,180
Okay.

4070
04:49:11,440 --> 04:49:12,440
Wait, when did I beat that?

4071
04:49:13,020 --> 04:49:15,480
I like having it all my ducks in a row.

4072
04:49:16,580 --> 04:49:17,580
La, la, la, la, la.

4073
04:49:20,020 --> 04:49:22,940
Harvester was four days ago.

4074
04:49:23,600 --> 04:49:25,020
That was...

4075
04:49:25,560 --> 04:49:25,940
Hold on.

4076
04:49:26,100 --> 04:49:26,920
You're going to hear it.

4077
04:49:29,460 --> 04:49:30,860
October 27th.

4078
04:49:30,860 --> 04:49:31,320
10.

4079
04:49:31,940 --> 04:49:32,640
27.

4080
04:49:35,380 --> 04:49:36,080
Harvester.

4081
04:49:37,080 --> 04:49:37,380
Okay.

4082
04:49:38,580 --> 04:49:40,420
So we're at...

4083
04:49:40,420 --> 04:49:41,600
32 games.

4084
04:49:41,680 --> 04:49:43,220
Wait, but someone said 33.

4085
04:49:43,360 --> 04:49:44,180
Fake Nate said 33.

4086
04:49:47,620 --> 04:49:49,600
I'm not counting Visage.

4087
04:49:49,920 --> 04:49:50,000
I'm not counting.

4088
04:49:50,020 --> 04:50:21,320
Doki did that What a list Brings back so many happy memories Watching your streams Yeah Honestly it's really fun to look at too Because I'm like wow I did so much this year Wow Wow Starting from January We completed a game It may I was going to say we completed a game every month But I did not complete a game in June I messed up.

4089
04:50:21,760 --> 04:50:22,940
Transformers Devastation.

4090
04:50:24,440 --> 04:50:25,660
Oh my gosh, please tell me I defeated.

4091
04:50:26,460 --> 04:50:27,360
I beat that in June.

4092
04:50:28,900 --> 04:50:31,180
Is the Mint plush gonna be available again?

4093
04:50:32,200 --> 04:50:32,720
Which one?

4094
04:50:32,940 --> 04:50:33,320
The Fumo?

4095
04:50:34,180 --> 04:50:34,520
Maybe.

4096
04:50:35,320 --> 04:50:36,520
The Small Minto?

4097
04:50:36,900 --> 04:50:39,120
I would like to have those available again someday.

4098
04:50:39,400 --> 04:50:40,740
Maybe in my next merch drop.

4099
04:50:41,780 --> 04:50:44,140
This little nerd in her video game spreadsheet.

4100
04:50:44,600 --> 04:50:45,000
Adorable!

4101
04:50:46,540 --> 04:50:47,100
Wait.

4102
04:50:48,720 --> 04:50:49,840
Transformers Devastation.

4103
04:50:50,020 --> 04:50:51,560
Oh, I didn't put that in.

4104
04:50:51,620 --> 04:50:52,580
Wait, when did I beat that?

4105
04:50:55,320 --> 04:50:59,360
Mint Phantom Transformers.

4106
04:51:02,060 --> 04:51:02,740
Brrrrbrrbrrbrrbrrr.

4107
04:51:05,160 --> 04:51:07,300

04:51:07,860 --> 04:51:09,540
I think this one is...

4109
04:51:09,540 --> 04:51:10,180
Hold on.

4110
04:51:11,280 --> 04:51:12,640
Checking the days.

4111
04:51:13,120 --> 04:51:13,740
February.

4112
04:51:14,100 --> 04:51:15,160
Okay, it was February.

4113
04:51:17,000 --> 04:51:18,360
February 21st.

4114
04:51:21,180 --> 04:51:22,820
Oh, I really did miss it.

4115
04:51:26,860 --> 04:51:29,260
Transformers Devastation.

4116
04:51:29,760 --> 04:51:31,820
Okay, then I'm not doing so bad.

4117
04:51:32,760 --> 04:51:33,600
I just have...

4118
04:51:33,600 --> 04:51:35,780
Wait, the number disappeared again, you guys.

4119
04:51:36,260 --> 04:51:37,460
Oh, I see why.

4120
04:51:37,600 --> 04:51:38,040
I see why.

4121
04:51:38,200 --> 04:51:38,440
Okay.

4122
04:51:38,920 --> 04:51:42,780
I was highlighting the empty columns, the empty rows.

4123
04:51:44,340 --> 04:51:46,680
Because it didn't have anything, it wasn't counting it.

4124
04:51:46,740 --> 04:51:47,380
I get it now.

4125
04:51:48,320 --> 04:51:50,000
I have 33 games.

4126
04:51:50,020 --> 04:51:51,300
out of 50.

4127
04:51:55,420 --> 04:51:56,360
Super liminal!

4128
04:51:56,700 --> 04:51:57,340
Oh my gosh!

4129
04:51:57,920 --> 04:51:57,920
Wait!

4130
04:52:00,160 --> 04:52:00,940
Wait, seriously?

4131
04:52:01,220 --> 04:52:03,280
I've been pulling the spreadsheets like...

4132
04:52:03,980 --> 04:52:06,800
Love the Jurassic Park arcade stream so much.

4133
04:52:06,900 --> 04:52:09,020
All the silly quarter bits during it were adorable.

4134
04:52:09,340 --> 04:52:10,640
I'm glad you liked that.

4135
04:52:10,720 --> 04:52:16,760
That was... I wanted to do the arcade game and then I was like, yeah, but I'm gonna like finish it.

4136
04:52:17,260 --> 04:52:24,540
So how can I make this more... Like the quarter bits were kind of It was a stroke of inspiration.

4137
04:52:26,160 --> 04:52:27,680
I'm glad you guys liked it.

4138
04:52:31,200 --> 04:52:32,560
I added Harvester.

4139
04:52:33,180 --> 04:52:33,780
Yeah, yeah.

4140
04:52:34,940 --> 04:52:36,120
I just added it.

4141
04:52:36,640 --> 04:52:39,020
So, wait, what was it super liminal too?

4142
04:52:39,360 --> 04:52:40,100
Oh, my gosh.

4143
04:52:41,560 --> 04:52:43,600
Please tell me I've finished that in June.

4144
04:52:44,980 --> 04:52:46,900
So I can have one game.

4145
04:52:47,060 --> 04:52:47,360
Oh, sorry.

4146
04:52:47,700 --> 04:52:49,240
One game done every...

4147
04:52:49,240 --> 04:52:49,900
No, March.

4148
04:52:50,020 --> 04:52:50,440
Dang it.

4149
04:52:50,520 --> 04:52:51,660
March 27th.

4150
04:52:52,260 --> 04:52:53,600
Ah, okay.

4151
04:52:57,080 --> 04:53:00,090
March 27th.

4152
04:53:00,830 --> 04:53:01,710
Super liminal.

4153
04:53:02,050 --> 04:53:03,570
I think I did that in one stream, though.

4154
04:53:05,650 --> 04:53:06,610
I think so.

4155
04:53:06,770 --> 04:53:07,850
I think that was a one stream.

4156
04:53:08,370 --> 04:53:09,950
One hitter.

4157
04:53:10,730 --> 04:53:11,350
I think so.

4158
04:53:12,910 --> 04:53:14,770
We love every bit of me for it, Dom.

4159
04:53:16,270 --> 04:53:17,050
Thank you.

4160
04:53:18,090 --> 04:53:20,510
Okay, let me show my new list now.

4161
04:53:21,350 --> 04:53:22,310
New list, new list.

4162
04:53:24,390 --> 04:53:26,030
New list.

4163
04:53:28,070 --> 04:53:29,470
New list.

4164
04:53:33,550 --> 04:53:34,150
Yay!

4165
04:53:37,290 --> 04:53:38,410
My gosh!

4166
04:53:39,790 --> 04:53:42,190
New list plus, yeah.

4167
04:53:45,650 --> 04:53:46,250
Wow!

4168
04:53:47,650 --> 04:53:49,890
We're at 34 games!

4169
04:53:50,950 --> 04:53:51,310
35?

4170
04:53:51,970 --> 04:53:52,210
Wait.

4171
04:53:52,790 --> 04:53:54,010
So that would be...

4172
04:53:54,010 --> 04:53:55,630
Wait, what's 50 minus 34?

4173
04:53:55,850 --> 04:53:56,710
Calculator.

4174
04:53:57,890 --> 04:53:59,290
50 minus 34.

4175
04:54:01,090 --> 04:54:01,750
Wait, is that how many?

4176
04:54:01,830 --> 04:54:07,790
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

4177
04:54:15,210 --> 04:54:15,750
Yeah.

4178
04:54:17,130 --> 04:54:17,670
Yeah.

4179
04:54:18,930 --> 04:54:20,470
You're missing a couple.

4180
04:54:21,090 --> 04:54:22,170
I don't think so.

4181
04:54:24,170 --> 04:54:25,250
No way!

4182
04:54:28,490 --> 04:54:30,890
Did you and Barry end up beating Battle Block Leader?

4183
04:54:31,030 --> 04:54:32,250
No, we haven't yet.

4184
04:54:32,530 --> 04:54:33,810
So I can add that.

4185
04:54:33,870 --> 04:54:35,810
We can, yeah, I can add that once.

4186
04:54:37,050 --> 04:54:37,610
Once.

4187
04:54:38,470 --> 04:54:47,130
I didn't shoot, I didn't, I didn't do peak because, you know, didn't feel right to say that I beat that game.

4188
04:54:47,490 --> 04:54:49,690
Oblivion also, I did not beat for sure.

4189
04:54:50,130 --> 04:54:51,190
I did not beat Oblivion.

4190
04:54:51,770 --> 04:54:52,870
DMCs were especially fun.

4191
04:54:53,010 --> 04:54:53,210
Really?

4192
04:54:53,330 --> 04:54:54,010
I think so.

4193
04:54:54,170 --> 04:54:56,830
Honestly, sometimes I really want to private those streams.

4194
04:54:59,710 --> 04:55:01,170
Sometimes I'm like,

4195
04:55:04,210 --> 04:55:06,750
Sometimes I think like, man, I,

4196
04:55:09,810 --> 04:55:15,650
I, I just, I, you know, I'm, it wasn't, it's not my type of game.

4197
04:55:16,010 --> 04:55:18,690
And so I didn't play it very well.

4198
04:55:18,890 --> 04:55:20,270
And so sometimes I'll just get comments.

4199
04:55:20,310 --> 04:55:28,130
I'll get occasional comments of people just being like, gosh, this is so painful to, to watch.

4200
04:55:28,490 --> 04:55:29,570
I didn't see faith.

4201
04:55:31,010 --> 04:55:33,810
Oh, how did I miss so many?

4202
04:55:35,510 --> 04:55:36,390
no way

4203
04:55:40,770 --> 04:55:52,350
oh I didn't but for faith do I count that as one game or how many games do I count that as that's three games right so faith one faith two faith three does that is that okay

4204
04:55:56,670 --> 04:55:57,550
three games

4205
04:56:02,390 --> 04:56:12,610
wait when did I do that oh my gosh you guys are helping me so much Faith Okay What?

4206
04:56:13,050 --> 04:56:37,390
Wait, that was a year ago, you guys It's only for 2025 It's only for 2025 Sorry, sorry These are games completed This year, I wanted to get to 50 games This year Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah It's okay though Good You still were trying.

4207
04:56:38,090 --> 04:56:39,070
You were trying to help me out.

4208
04:56:39,210 --> 04:56:40,370
I appreciate that so much.

4209
04:56:43,170 --> 04:56:43,650
Yeah.

4210
04:56:44,390 --> 04:56:45,410
I appreciate it.

4211
04:56:45,650 --> 04:56:46,030
Don't worry.

4212
04:56:53,850 --> 04:56:54,330
Okay.

4213
04:57:03,230 --> 04:57:04,890
So, I'll do my best.

4214
04:57:05,890 --> 04:57:07,290
34 games out of 50.

4215
04:57:07,430 --> 04:57:07,810
Not bad.

4216
04:57:07,910 --> 04:57:08,250
Not bad.

4217
04:57:08,350 --> 04:57:08,810
Not bad.

4218
04:57:09,650 --> 04:57:11,890
I found your DMC streams great.

4219
04:57:12,170 --> 04:57:12,810
They're peak silly.

4220
04:57:12,990 --> 04:57:14,130
People are just try-hards.

4221
04:57:14,310 --> 04:57:15,870
Yeah, I guess that's, you know.

4222
04:57:17,310 --> 04:57:19,610
Henry Stickman is technically four games in one.

4223
04:57:19,730 --> 04:57:19,910
Duh!

4224
04:57:21,670 --> 04:57:23,530
Mimpy like five games in one stream.

4225
04:57:23,650 --> 04:57:24,150
She's correct!

4226
04:57:24,230 --> 04:57:24,650
I know!

4227
04:57:24,790 --> 04:57:25,510
I'm a gamer!

4228
04:57:25,810 --> 04:57:26,550
I'm a gamer!

4229
04:57:30,510 --> 04:57:35,330
I think now I feel a little more confident about completing it in the next two months.

4230
04:57:35,470 --> 04:57:36,290
I think we can do it.

4231
04:57:36,970 --> 04:57:42,170
I think we can, I think we could get through a lot of, a lot of games.

4232
04:57:42,570 --> 04:57:46,210
Yeah, games like repo, I saw some people mentioning like Zoo Tycoon and stuff too.

4233
04:57:46,350 --> 04:57:47,910
Those don't really have like endings.

4234
04:57:47,990 --> 04:57:48,810
It's not really...

4235
04:57:48,830 --> 04:57:51,850
This plague ink count that I...

4236
04:57:52,490 --> 04:57:53,230
I don't know.

4237
04:57:53,390 --> 04:57:55,130
I feel like I want it to be like...

4238
04:57:55,130 --> 04:57:58,590
My criteria is a little specific, you know, where it's like...

4239
04:57:58,590 --> 04:58:01,150
It must have...

4240
04:58:01,150 --> 04:58:03,130
Like an ending, you know?

4241
04:58:03,530 --> 04:58:03,970
Like...

4242
04:58:03,970 --> 04:58:06,270
I feel like plague ink...

4243
04:58:06,270 --> 04:58:08,410
I feel like I can't count...

4244
04:58:08,410 --> 04:58:09,430
Like, this plague...

4245
04:58:09,430 --> 04:58:11,450
Plague doesn't count as a roguelike, obviously.

4246
04:58:11,550 --> 04:58:14,750
But like, you know, games that are kind of repetitive like that...

4247
04:58:14,750 --> 04:58:16,070
I'm kind of...

4248
04:58:16,070 --> 04:58:17,650
I'm kind of a little more...

4249
04:58:19,370 --> 04:58:21,770
specific on the criteria.

4250
04:58:24,770 --> 04:58:28,630
So, that's why there are some games that are...

4251
04:58:28,630 --> 04:58:30,290
Did you play the new Chilla's art?

4252
04:58:31,770 --> 04:58:32,810
The fishing one?

4253
04:58:33,050 --> 04:58:34,370
Right now, it's only a demo.

4254
04:58:35,810 --> 04:58:36,930
Nemi's vase!

4255
04:58:43,910 --> 04:58:46,470
Yeah, I played the fishing demo.

4256
04:58:46,730 --> 04:58:47,450
I did do that.

4257
04:58:47,850 --> 05:00:19,330
If you go to my stream, if you wanted to watch, the what was it called that's like me playing demo games or something spooky demo sorry that was mine that was my controller spooky demo sometimes up that's a random playing random horror games i played it there that should count right no it was a demo it was a demo but i believe we could do it if you you actually what i'll do is i'll make a members post and i'll say if you have any streams that you think or any games that you think could be beat in one stream um and i would say anything between like three to five hours is doable but you beat the whole demo three to five hours i think is something that is doable for you can even go to six hours yeah you could go to six hours three to six hours for a stream I think so I will make so everybody who has been wanting to suggest your games to me it helps as well if maybe you link either like a steam page or something like that oh actually I don't think you can in a comment huh um yeah just say

4258
05:00:19,330 --> 05:00:40,550
the name of it maybe give if you have time like a like a brief description what kind of game it is red dead redemption 2 if you played club penguin and played every mini game in it would that count i don't know tuna would it would you let that count tuna would you

4259
05:00:46,410 --> 05:00:50,310
is there a community discord or something There is a fan discord.

4260
05:00:51,010 --> 05:00:52,110
I am not in it.

4261
05:00:52,350 --> 05:00:52,970
I'm sorry.

4262
05:00:54,830 --> 05:00:57,470
So, but you could discuss ideas in there.

4263
05:00:57,590 --> 05:00:59,850
You could be like, hey, do you think Pinto would like this game?

4264
05:01:01,850 --> 05:01:02,270
So.

4265
05:01:04,430 --> 05:01:05,350
Okie dokie.

4266
05:01:05,790 --> 05:01:06,770
I'm banned.

4267
05:01:07,330 --> 05:01:08,370
I'm banned from it.

4268
05:01:08,670 --> 05:01:09,070
Why?

4269
05:01:09,570 --> 05:01:10,010
Why?

4270
05:01:10,270 --> 05:01:10,590
Why?

4271
05:01:11,290 --> 05:01:12,910
You guys hate me.

4272
05:01:13,510 --> 05:01:14,050
You say it.

4273
05:01:14,370 --> 05:01:14,790
You say.

4274
05:01:15,290 --> 05:01:16,830
You say I hate you.

4275
05:01:16,990 --> 05:01:17,730
You hate me.

4276
05:01:20,990 --> 05:01:24,630
Can you play Merge Laboobu?

4277
05:01:25,250 --> 05:01:25,370
Okay.

4278
05:01:27,170 --> 05:01:28,810
I want to play what was that?

4279
05:01:28,870 --> 05:01:29,890
What's that like?

4280
05:01:30,450 --> 05:01:33,150
Isn't it like Merge Mansion or something?

4281
05:01:33,490 --> 05:01:36,150
Mystery Gardenscapes?

4282
05:01:36,750 --> 05:01:37,630
Mystery Mansion?

4283
05:01:37,990 --> 05:01:39,030
I saw something with Mansion.

4284
05:01:39,290 --> 05:01:43,630
