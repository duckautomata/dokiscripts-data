1
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:27,910
We just started and there's so many gifted!

2
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:33,810
Thank you!

3
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,350
Oh my gosh, thank you guys!

4
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,010
Thank you!

5
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,870
Holy moly canoli...

6
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:43,970
Stromboli...

7
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,950
Zamboni...

8
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:46,810
That doesn't look quite right.

9
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,270
Thank you guys!

10
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,990
Welcome back, master and mistress!

11
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,390
Hello everybody!

12
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,070
Hello!

13
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,910
I get this too fast!

14
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,910
Actually, I can't even keep up.

15
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,130
This is insanity.

16
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,690
Oh my goodness, thank you guys!

17
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,990
Thank you so much!

18
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,390
Thank you for all the gifted!

19
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

20
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,670
Holy cow!

21
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,150
Happy anniversary!

22
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,710
Thank you!

23
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,670
It's weird because it's like...

24
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,210
I mean, obviously I'm not going to celebrate this anniversary every year, right?

25
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,010
Because it's not really my anniversary.

26
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,750
Like, my anniversary is in July.

27
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,890
So...

28
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,670
It's funny to be like...

29
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,690
I get two anniversaries this year!

30
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:53,610
But this year, only this time we'll celebrate one year back, right?

31
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,970
I'm allowed?

32
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,090
Yippee!

33
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:04,750
Many anniversaries.

34
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,310
It'll start to lose it's pizzazz.

35
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,090
Probably.

36
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,910
It'll probably lose the pizzazz after some time.

37
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,270
If I did so many, you know?

38
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,580
Anniversary every day.

39
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,100
Returniversary, yeah.

40
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
Returniversary yesterday.

41
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,180
And I just wanted to do some karaoke.

42
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,600
Pretty chill.

43
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,980
Maybe.

44
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,460
Maybe.

45
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,760
How do you... Wait, I have to ask.

46
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,460
What is this question, Justin?

47
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,940
What is this?

48
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,140
Am I feeling okay?

49
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,440
Yeah!

50
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,420
Yeah, I'm okay.

51
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm okay.

52
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,840
I... I initially had a little bit of a migraine.

53
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:00,980
But...

54
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,680
I'm okay now.

55
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,320
Actually, actually.

56
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:04,880
Oh my gosh.

57
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,500
I was like, oh, I think I need like an extra 15 minutes.

58
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,540
Because usually it takes like...

59
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:15,620
Takes like half hours over the meds to kick in, baby.

60
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,820
And I did.

61
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,500
So we're all good.

62
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,800
Yeah, thank you for all the gifted.

63
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,900
Thank you guys.

64
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,900
Thank you.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,880
Thank you.

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,640
The notice are gonna be backed up to hell.

67
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,100
But I see, I see.

68
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,160
You stream lab donos, I see you.

69
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,300
Thank you for that, Kasupa.

70
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,220
Karenai hana.

71
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,780
Karenai hana.

72
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,800
Have you requested that before?

73
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Hold on, I'm gonna go check.

74
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,500
If you did, I didn't write it down.

75
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,760
I wrote it down.

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,960
I have a channel called...

77
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,260
Called Songs to Learn.

78
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,540
Songs to Learn.

79
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,580
Congrats on your business insider article.

80
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,340
Oh my gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

81
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,040
I'm so embarrassed.

82
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,640
Yeah, I got an email.

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
They were like, hi, I'm from Business Insider.

84
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,880
I recently interviewed Yago of Hololive.

85
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,620
Can I interview you too?

86
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,640
I was like...

87
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,060
I was like, wow.

88
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,540
Okay.

89
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,040
It was so... A part of me was like, is this even real?

90
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,700
Am I gonna end up on some site?

91
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh yeah, big shot over here.

92
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,000
I was like, this is so crazy.

93
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,100
Yeah, so you can find me.

94
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,440
Famous.

95
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,820
No, rather infamous Vtuber.

96
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,620
Mint Phantom on Business Insider.

97
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,620
You never know what I'm gonna cook up next.

98
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,100
You never know.

99
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,360
I was like, me?

100
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
Of all Vtubers?

101
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,020
I felt so shocked.

102
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,920
I feel like there are much better options.

103
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,680
Even for like Indies, you know, but...

104
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,260
Yippee!

105
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,960
Winto's all business.

106
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

107
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,060
That was so funny.

108
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,420
Honorary Vtuber.

109
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,240
I was like, I don't know, when I think of like...

110
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,400
You know, maybe like ShyLily, you know, because she has like the...

111
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,540
She has like a gamer subs everything.

112
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,040
Like, someone like that.

113
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,280
I'm just like twiddling my thumbs over here.

114
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,860
I don't know what the heck I'm doing.

115
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,260
I don't even have...

116
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,760
So I was like, oh, okay, cool.

117
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:32,560
Yippee!

118
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,900
Well, yeah, so it's funny.

119
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,380
But we're in the big leagues now.

120
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm so shy.

121
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,060
I'm so embarrassed.

122
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,720
But Amanda is who interviewed me.

123
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,760
She was very nice.

124
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,420
She was very, very nice.

125
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,200
I also want to say before we start karaoke.

126
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,260
Anything goes.

127
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll be honest, I was going to have a setlist and then I got so busy with everything.

128
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,260
Like I started writing things down and I think I wrote two songs down.

129
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,840
And I was like, it's fine.

130
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,520
I'll be able to...

131
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,440
I'll be able to write the other songs down later.

132
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,140
And I did not.

133
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,200
I'm sorry, guys.

134
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,460
I'm so ill-prepared.

135
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,320
We're just going by vibes.

136
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,560
We're going by vibes.

137
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,980
My voice is...

138
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,180
My voice has been pretty bad recently.

139
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,640
And the pollen and super ring time is not helping at all.

140
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,040
Oh my gosh, it's actually so, so bad.

141
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,080
So, please...

142
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,060
I'm so sorry in advance.

143
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:09,560
It might be a little more chill because of that.

144
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,240
Chill and short.

145
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,630
Pollen going kind of crazy this year.

146
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,390
I know.

147
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,470
It is.

148
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,730
We can have borderline marathon karaoke.

149
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,150
Right?

150
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,450
We got to do it again.

151
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,450
We got to do it again.

152
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:35,810
No!

153
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,690
She actually said that I showed up in her algorithm.

154
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,570
And she said that she went to Holo Expo.

155
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,170
I think she's going down the rabbit hole so much.

156
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,270
Chill and short just like you.

157
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:53,350
Chill.

158
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,940
Face interviewer.

159
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,840
Yeah, she was like, I just got back from the big event.

160
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,520
Last month.

161
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,580
And I was like, yeah.

162
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,360
Yeah.

163
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,580
Happy day of birth.

164
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,580
It's not my birthday.

165
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,320
It's not my birthday.

166
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
What should we start with, you guys?

167
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,000
Let me get my karaoke stuff up.

168
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,320
If I want to sing some JP songs and they are not...

169
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,320
If they do not have instrumentals, I will...

170
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,480
Wait, is my switch hooked up?

171
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,140
I might have to hook up my switch.

172
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,600
Can you sing He Lives in You from The Lion King 2?

173
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,760
Do I remember?

174
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,420
I think I remember just the chorus.

175
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,860
He lives in you.

176
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
He lives in me.

177
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,700
He watches over everything we see.

178
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,240
Game on!

179
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:12,900
Thank you!

180
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,080
Creativity and sense of humor always make the week easier to get through.

181
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:19,780
Really?

182
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,360
Swap goals.

183
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,380
Thank you so much for the 50.

184
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,660
Thank you!

185
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,820
Thank you guys for all the gifted memberships.

186
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,860
You guys are going insane.

187
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,980
I just saw how many members were gifted.

188
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,640
How many new members?

189
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,420
Oh my god.

190
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,780
Twinkle Dogs debut song?

191
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,760
Oh yes, I was going to talk about Twinkle Dogs a little bit, right?

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,920
Oh my gosh.

193
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,580
Yes, I said that I would talk about my April Fools stream today.

194
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,040
So...

195
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
So...

196
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,880
If you didn't...

197
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,020
If you didn't notice...

198
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,940
Maybe you don't have Twitter.

199
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,840
The...

200
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,600
The...

201
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,440
Everybody who debuted were actual wisps.

202
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,220
Who submitted their info to me.

203
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,080
Thank you.

204
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,340
If you don't know what I'm talking about, go watch my...

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,380
My April Fools stream.

206
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,320
The debut of Twinkle Dogs.

207
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:30,980
But...

208
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
So I put out a survey and I got thousands of responses.

209
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,700
And I felt so bad.

210
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,260
I could only... I was just like...

211
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,100
How well... You know...

212
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,180
I can only choose like a literal handful.

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,120
So...

214
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,080
But everything that I put up...

215
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,880
Actually, I forgot to do something that I was going to ask.

216
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,120
Which was a special talent.

217
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,760
Which, honestly, I was so scuffed and so flustered through the whole thing.

218
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,220
Trying to make everything work that...

219
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,320
I...

220
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,600
I didn't even... Probably wouldn't have even done this special talent.

221
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,840
But it was going to be, you know...

222
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,500
So, I forgot to ask that.

223
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,060
Happy one year!

224
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,160
Thank you!

225
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,660
I will support Rito forever!

226
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Thank you, TokTok!

227
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,600
Thank you!

228
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,620
And...

229
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,460
So yeah...

230
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,600
I pulled all of them randomly, except...

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,880
Except Sen.

232
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,820
Who was, I think, number 444.

233
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,540
No, that was Patty.

234
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,080
Patty was 444.

235
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:35,780
I think.

236
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,780
One of them was 444.

237
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,280
Which I was just like, I have to pick a spooky number.

238
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,500
So...

239
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,580
I picked a spooky number myself.

240
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,320
And then everybody else was pulled randomly.

241
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,420
And...

242
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,800
Originally, so for this song that I made...

243
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,500
Make You Kyunkyun Kyururun Saturday...

244
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:58,660
Wait.

245
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,480
Make You Kyunkyun Kyururun Friday Night.

246
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,580
See, I'm...

247
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,100
Okay, this is the story.

248
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,040
So, I originally called it...

249
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,760
Make You Kyunkyun Kyururun Saturday Night.

250
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,320
Right?

251
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,980
And then when I...

252
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,680
So each...

253
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,780
Also...

254
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,200
Each time I recorded that...

255
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,960
Was one take.

256
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,100
Each time.

257
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,780
I made it up on the spot for the first one.

258
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,020
And then I just copied...

259
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,180
And then I just followed along...

260
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:28,980
With myself.

261
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,820
Each time.

262
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,980
And what had happened was...

263
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,140
But...

264
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,820
Well, I say it's a first take.

265
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,260
But...

266
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,280
I was practicing.

267
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,580
And I was like...

268
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:45,940
Kyunkyun...

269
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,860
Saturday Night.

270
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,480
But I had changed it...

271
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
From Saturday...

272
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,100
I originally called it Saturday Night.

273
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,540
And I changed it to Friday Night.

274
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,640
Because it kind of flowed a bit better.

275
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
And so then...

276
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,700
I was like...

277
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,660
Saturday...

278
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:57,840
Whoops!

279
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,280
Friday Night.

280
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,300
And so from there...

281
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,060
I was like...

282
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,340
Wait.

283
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,460
And so I changed the...

284
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,300
Originally, it was just kind of like a thirst song.

285
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,920
Where it was just like...

286
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,900
Oh yeah, baby girl.

287
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
You're so...

288
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,140
You know, I'm a dog.

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,100
Woof woof.

290
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,760
And so then I changed all the lyrics to be like...

291
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,440
To be like...

292
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,620
Oh no, I can't.

293
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,180
I don't know what day of the week it is.

294
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,740
So...

295
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,420
It was actually an incident.

296
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,480
Like an actual true incident.

297
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,180
That...

298
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,360
That happened.

299
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,180
Finally played the NES games for the first time.

300
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,760
Paid.

301
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,920
So yeah, we can sing Kyun Kyun.

302
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,020
Kyun Kyun.

303
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:52,780
Here, I'll sing it.

304
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,520
Minto version.

305
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,180
And if you ever want to sing...

306
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,020
Make you Kyun Kyun Kyururun Saturday...

307
00:17:59,020 --> 00:17:59,420
Oh, sorry.

308
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,300
Friday Night.

309
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,240
It's actually a Doba Syndrome song.

310
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,380
Called...

311
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,740
Is it this one?

312
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,280
Yeah.

313
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,320
Called Sum...

314
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:12,740
Wait.

315
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,200
Summer?

316
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,120
Is that the one?

317
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,240
Hold on.

318
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,360
Yeah, this is...

319
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,380
So I saw some people being like...

320
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,340
I wish there was an instrumental.

321
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,160
Well, there is.

322
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,580
Because it's a Doba Syndrome song.

323
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,160
So, yeah.

324
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,180
Okay, I'll sing it.

325
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,240
My version.

326
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:41,720
Minto.

327
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,100
Minto only.

328
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,740
Hold on.

329
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,140
Wait.

330
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:38,020
Give me a chance to make this alright I got the day wrong I should've checked it twice I'm a dog, I can be naughty or nice I can see the twinkle in your eyes A little lick on your nose For a surprise Don't turn me down Or I'll be so glum You can pat my head Or scratch my bum It's a cute-a-doon Friday Whoops,

331
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,140

332
00:19:42,220 --> 00:20:08,800

333
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,740
That's the song

334
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:29,910
So I hope you guys liked that song My cute-a-doon

335

Hold on I'll do it Make you cute-a-doon Friday night Does it make you feel that way?

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:10,470
It's a cute-a-doon Wait, it's a cute-a-doon Saturday And literally when I was recording it, I was like...

342
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:31,150
It's a cute-a-doon Saturday And then I go whoops One year ago I was known as Jin Sakai, the ghost of Tsushima After liberating my home from the invaders I was stripped of my prestige and sentenced to seppuku After fleeing my hometown I was infected with the phantom virus and became ghost of mint Happy one year

343
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,530
Twinkle twinkle little star

344
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:52,330
I wonder if there's like a dramatic version on here Twinkle twinkle little star Let's see if there's like... Oh, what's this?

00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,820
Apparently...

351
00:23:39,920 --> 00:24:01,520
Apparently they're trying to change the L, M, N, O, P part of the alphabet song But that's my favorite part L, M, N, O, P It sounds like a word, it doesn't sound like it's naming letters It's my favorite part L, M, N, O, P Who is they?

352
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:10,800
The world L, M, N, O, P They've been trying to change it What?

They're not trying, they already did No, I don't know what the new version is Wait, hold on, new...

357
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,960
What is the new one?

358
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,280
They didn't say what it is

376
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,640
Why would you even tell me to sing something backwards?

377
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,660
Oh my gosh, Mary had a little lamb.

00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,980
I'm so scuffed all the time.

411
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,540
Okay, I'm gonna sing a real song.

412
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,440
Oh, someone sent a dono off stream and asked for this song.

413
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,640
So, since I see it on here, I'm gonna sing it.

414
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,720
I can't escape, I can't wait.

415
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,180
I need a hit, baby give me it.

416
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,640
You're dangerous, I'm loving it.

417
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,900
Too high, can't come down.

418
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,260
Losing my head, spinning round and round.

419
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,860
Do you feel me now?

420
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,510
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride.

421
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,770
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

422
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:27,530
Taste of a poison paradise, I'm addicted to you.

423
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,470
Don't you know that you're toxic?

424
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,130
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

425
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,980
It's getting late to give you up.

426
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:50,400
I took a sip from the devil's cup.

427
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,260
Slowly it's leaking over me.

428
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,860
Too high, can't come down.

429
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,800
It's in the air and it's all around.

430
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,750
With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride.

431
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,490
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

432
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,590
Taste of a poison paradise, I'm addicted to you.

433
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:26,350
Don't you know that you're toxic?

434
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,210
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

435
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,050
Don't you know that you're toxic?

436
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,290
Don't you know that you're toxic?

437
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,910
With the

438
00:33:48,460 --> 00:34:00,380
taste of your lips, I'm on a ride.

439
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:03,420
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

440
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,180
Taste of a poison paradise, I'm addicted to you.

441
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,200
Don't you know that you're toxic?

442

With the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride.

443
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,780
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

444
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,660
Taste of a poison paradise, I'm addicted to you.

445
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,620
Don't you know that you're toxic?

446
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,340
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now.

447
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,580
Think I'm ready now, I think I'm ready now.

448
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,040
Intoxicate me now, with your lovin' now.

449
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,700
I think I'm...

450
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,360
That was toxic.

451
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,400
Freak out for Minky.

452
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,420
Thank you.

453
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,260
Thankful for the Minky mole reveal we got this year.

454
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,260

455
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,060

Thank you so much.

462
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,620
Not Lelouch.

463
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,720
The Lelouch.

464
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,100
I only discovered you upon your re-debut.

465
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,320
I became one of your fans.

466
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,520
Only if you can...

467
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,160
I don't know Invisible!

468
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:22,940
I know.

469
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:34,040
Hold on guys, I need to take a little bit more medicine.

470
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:34,820
Give me a second.

471
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,510
Okay, sorry about that.

472
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:01,990
Sorry about that.

473
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:05,970
Radioactive.

474
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:06,450
Radioactive.

475
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,430
Radioactive.

476
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:11,930
Gosh, I don't know why I'm always like... I don't know what to sing.

477
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:18,370
And I always have like a list, but I just blank out as soon as I get on stream.

478
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,270
I don't want to sing the same songs I always do, so I'm trying to like go through a list.

479
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,410
Hold on.

480
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,610
Wait, there is one song.

481
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,190
Shojo Ray?

482
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,390
Oh I can sing that one.

483
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,710
In the meantime.

484
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,450
Minecraft movie drops on my birthday.

485
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:43,990
Let's go!

486
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:44,870
Happy early birthday!

487
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:51,090
Shojo Ray.

488
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,150
Shojo Ray.

489
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,740
Freak Wooden Bit.

490
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,000
Celine Dion.

491
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,940
I could do Celine Dion, but I don't know that one.

492
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,360
Wait, it's all coming back to me.

493
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,660
Freak on a leash.

494
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,900
Give me a second.

495
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,860
I've been waiting 9 years.

496
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,700
What do you mean 9 years?

497
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,760
I can try.

498
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,000
It's a special day.

499
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,840
I'll try Invisible.

500
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,840
But let me sing Shojo Ray first.

501
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,380
It has a volume.

502
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,700
Oh

503
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:15,620
The sky is blue through the window Are you my friend?

504
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:46,880
Yes, you are my friend Take my hand Yes, without you I don't have a place to stay In this transparent world If we can love each other

505
00:40:50,260 --> 00:41:22,660
I'll repeat Flashback, the voice of cicadas You, who will never return Forever torn apart A matching key holder A girl with a white flag that the summer has erased I want to be so sad that I get tired You pointed at me in the transparent world

506
00:41:27,860 --> 00:42:04,820
That was Shoujo, right?

507
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,460
Shoujo, right?

508
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,240
Thank you so much!

509
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,680
I don't know any Judas Priest songs.

510
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,380
I don't think so.

511
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,080
Let me look it up.

512
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,640
If there is anything I recognize, you know?

513
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,800
Sometimes I know songs and I don't know who they are sung by, you know?

514
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:29,500
Thank you!

515
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,940
Thank you for the super chat!

516
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,960
Thank you!

517
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,360
Thank you so much!

518
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,780
Can you recognize?

519
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:42,520
Judas Priest Nothing is...

520
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:53,940
Nothing is standing out, I'm sorry Breaking the law I see that one but I don't know it Let me hear it

521
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:26,950
Wait I do know this song.

522
00:43:27,070 --> 00:43:32,710
Wait, I'm gonna write it down for next time though Breaking the law, breaking the law.

523

00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:48,250
Breaking the law, breaking the law

526
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,050
What I was gonna sing though?

527
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:58,750
Oh gosh

528
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,950
I don't know how this song goes.

529
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:18,210
I seriously don't I feel bullied into this song I feel bullied into this song right now

530
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:42,720
Walking by the wall The shadows will not fall Oh, I just realized Here, I'm gonna have it low

531
00:44:47,550 --> 00:45:08,290
Discouraged by the noise Living without choice Is a life without a voice When you can't even say my name Has the memory gone?

532
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:10,350
Are you feeling numb?

533
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:22,050
Go and call I can't play this game, so I ask again Will you say my name?

534
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,110
Has the memory gone?

535
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,110
Are you feeling numb?

536
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:30,930
Or have I become invisible?

537
00:45:41,410 --> 00:46:11,390
The dreamers wish away It's falling on my face The shape of my disgrace When you don't hear a word I say As the talking goes, it's a one-way flow No fault, no blame Has the memory gone?

538
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:13,290
Are you feeling numb?

539
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,090
And have I become invisible?

540
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:25,650
Invisible Invisible

541
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:49,330
Invisible Invisible Invisible Invisible No word here Oh, a word They say Has the memory gone?

542
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,330
Are you feeling numb?

543
00:46:51,450 --> 00:47:11,550
Not a word They say But a voiceless crowd isn't backing down When the air turns red With a loaded head Hesitation Can you say my name?

544
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:14,550
Has the memory gone?

545
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:20,220
Are you feeling invisible?

546
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,700
There!

547
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:32,960
I finally sang Invisible by Duran Duran I finally

548
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,260
sang Duran Duran Invisible.

549
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,680
Invisible by Duran Duran I finally did it.

550
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,980
Thanks Play for FGSP No!

551
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:50,540
No!

552
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,000
No!

553
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,620
No!

554
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,920
Another Lurker Whisper.

555
00:47:57,940 --> 00:47:59,160
Thank you!

556
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,400
Sing along?

557
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,120
What shall we sing along then?

558
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,860
What shall we sing along?

559
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,820
I wonder if they have it on here I can do it.

560
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,720
Wait, the short version

561
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:59,310
Wait Oh my god, the lyrics are early

562
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:03,830
Oh wait, hold on.

563
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,870
Wait, the lyrics are like not in sync with the music.

564
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:09,570
So I'm like having to remember what it is.

565
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,070
Wait, hold on.

566
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:15,070
Let me try this one instead Maybe this one's better

567
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:33,330
Oh, it's a still.

568
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:34,490
It's still.

569
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:35,490
Okay, I'll do this.

570
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,430
It's the long version.

571
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:38,110
I don't know the long version, but we'll try

572
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,680
The key is different.

573
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,600
What is happening?

574
00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:10,870
I don't know the lyrics

575
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:24,130
I don't know what to say.

576
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:29,550
I'm so bad with words.

577
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:41,870
But, but why did I say goodbye?

578
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:49,210
No, no, no way.

579
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:56,370
I love you, and I love you too much.

580
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:08,210
No matter how strong I try to avoid you, my memories won't waver.

581
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:11,570
I'm such an idiot.

582
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,000
I'm such an idiot.

583
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,260
I'm such an idiot.

584
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,240
All I do is believe in you.

585
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:49,960
Pretending to be a strong woman, I bathe in the night breeze of pain.

586
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:58,380
It's been three years since I've been alone.

587
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,960
Even the streets have changed.

588
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:15,200
But, but why did I leave behind only regrets?

589
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:23,260
I'm such a worthless man.

590
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,660
I'm going to take off my ring.

591
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,980
I'm going to live my life.

592
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,460
I'm going to take off my ring.

593
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:41,440
I'm going to live my life.

594
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,900
No,

595
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:12,000
no, no way.

596
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:18,340
I love you, and I love you too much.

597
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:30,880
No matter how strong I try to avoid you, my memories won't waver.

598
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,000
I'm such an idiot.

599
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:40,720
I'm such a worthless man.

600
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,460
I'm going to take off my ring.

601
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,620
I'm going to live my life.

602
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:00,540
What are these tears?

603
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:29,020
I'm such an idiot.

604
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,780
I'm such an idiot.

605
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,280
Let's see.

606
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:44,800
I saw this one earlier.

607
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,580
This one will make me cry though for real.

608
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,440
This one will make me cry though for real.

609
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:56,560
I feel like though this one is good to sing because we just got to this part in Peace Walker.

610
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:18,300
Sing, sing a song.

611
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:21,100
Sing out loud.

612
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,280
Sing out strong.

613
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:31,140
Sing of good things, not bad.

614
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:37,480
Sing of happy, not sad.

615
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,440
Sing, sing a song.

616
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:51,540
Make it simple to last your whole life long.

617
00:55:53,360 --> 00:56:00,140
Don't worry that it's not good enough for anyone else to hear.

618
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:05,780
Just sing, sing a song.

619
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:17,880
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

620
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,560
Sing, sing a song.

621
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,580
Let the world sing along.

622
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,920
Sing a song.

623
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:37,880
Sing a love there could be.

624
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:43,760
Sing for you and for me.

625
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:50,520
Sing, sing a song.

626
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:57,200
Make it simple to last your whole life long.

627
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:06,240
Don't worry that it's not good enough for anyone else to hear.

628
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:07,900
Just sing.

629
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,560
Sing a song.

630
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,680
Just sing.

631
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,880
Just sing.

632
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,660
Sing a song.

633
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,180
La, la, la, la, la...

634
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,080
Can

635
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,350
we change the instrumental for this?

636
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,270
I don't remember so many backup singers.

637
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:06,070
La, la, la, la, la...

638
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:38,350
Let me see... S-rank.

639
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:49,730
Sing... Sing a song...

640
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,490
Wait, they have this song!

641
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:54,850
Actually I don't think I've ever sang this song before.

642
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:56,910
But I really like this song.

643
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:02,910
Unfortunately, the band like... totally... like...

644
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,590
Well, I really like this song.

645
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,750
Unfortunately, the band is not around anymore.

646
00:59:07,990 --> 00:59:12,870
Because, unfortunately, they all like... they got into a car accident.

647
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,590
And so, they all passed away.

648
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:17,510
And it's so sad.

649
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:19,190
But I really like this song.

650
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,270
I listen to it all the time.

651
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:23,690
So... I can't believe they have this one.

652
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:27,050
I wonder what key I should sing it in though.

653
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:33,570
Between their legs, something's out of place.

654
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:38,470
I bet their mothers let them know what I'm about to face.

655
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:40,870
But your mouth's it's...

656
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,990
Baby, I've been there before.

657
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:55,090
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone.

658
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,930
And now I'm still hanging on.

659
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:02,070
I was at the end of every tether.

660
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,930
Waiting for what once was.

661
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:09,930
Important

662
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,520
stuff.

663
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,600
What's your favorite color?

664
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,520
What makes you so tough?

665
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,480
Please don't let go when you've had enough.

666
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,060
Please.

667
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,600
Baby, I've been there before.

668
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:44,600
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone.

669
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,840
And now I'm still hanging on.

670
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,480
I was at the end of every tether.

671
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:55,420
Waiting for what once was.

672
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:55,880
Please.

673
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:44,050
I was at the point where all I really wanted was someone.

674
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:47,310
And now I'm still hanging on.

675
01:02:47,610 --> 01:02:50,910
I was at the end of every tether.

676
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:55,250
Waiting for what once was.

677
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:05,340
Waiting for my love.

678
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,080
Waiting for...

679
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:39,150
Yay!

680
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:42,930
That was What Once Was by H.E.R.S.

681
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,730
Such a good song.

682
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:48,330
It's like my go-to late-night walk song.

683
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:52,470
Or like late-night drive song, you know?

684
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:55,870
If you're driving down a long road and it's late at night.

685
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:58,490
That's like the vibe.

686
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:01,310
That's like the vibe song.

687
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,090
So good.

688
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,770
It's so good.

689
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:08,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:10,210
Good driving song, right?

691
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,710
Chewing mint leaves?

692
01:04:15,030 --> 01:04:16,150
What the hell?

693
01:04:17,610 --> 01:04:18,770
Wait, Indie?

694
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:25,350
Are you Indie that submitted Indie for the survey?

695
01:04:26,050 --> 01:04:28,010
Do you know Mulan Reflection?

696
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:28,530
I do.

697
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:28,970
You know what?

698
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,430
I will sing Mulan Reflection.

699
01:04:30,430 --> 01:04:33,430
Nan, you're always requesting stuff and I don't know it, so...

700
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,600
Dreams by Fleetwood?

701
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:38,800
Yeah.

702
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:44,460
I'm writing lists of stuff that I see every so now and then.

703
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,300
That I can sing.

704
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:50,900
Sorry.

705
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,100
Oh my gosh, Reflection though.

706
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,540
This is so... Have I ever sung this song before?

707
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,740
Nan, why are you in such a Disney mood?

708
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,640
It was them!

709
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,440
Indie!

710
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:07,480
Indie!

711
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,200
Real Mulan!

712
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:12,400
What are you talking about?

713
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:20,360
Mulan is so good though.

714
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:25,610
The song is so short.

715
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:50,110
Look at me I may never pass for a perfect bride Or a perfect daughter Can it be?

716
01:05:51,250 --> 01:06:10,490
I'm not meant to play this part Now I see That if I were to truly to be myself I would break my family's heart I'm too freaky you guys!

717
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:52,790
Who is that girl I see Staring straight back at me Why is my reflection Someone I don't know Somehow I cannot hide Who I am though I've tried When will my reflection show Who I am inside

718
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:05,890
When will my reflection show that I'm

719
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:24,680
just an old man?

720
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,920
Wait, now I kind of want to sing some more Mulan.

721
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:38,380
Oh no, not this one.

722
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:39,800
Ah, we'll sing both.

723
01:07:54,550 --> 01:08:02,230
Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns.

724
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:10,050
Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?

725
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:14,690
You're the saddest bunch I ever met.

726
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:23,790
But you can bet before we're through, Mr. I'll make a man out.

727
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,800
Tranquil as a forest, but I'm fine.

728
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:43,580
Once you find your center, you are sure to win.

729
01:08:44,740 --> 01:08:48,380
You're a spineless man, pathetic lot.

730
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:51,880
And you haven't got a clue.

731
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:58,080
Somehow I'll make a man out of you.

732
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:06,240
I'm never gonna catch my breath, say goodbye to those who knew me.

733
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:09,140
Boy, was I a fool, I took school for a cutting gym.

734
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:14,700
This guy's got him scared to death, hope he doesn't see right through me.

735
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,860
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim.

736
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:19,360
Be a man!

737
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:22,840
We must be swift as the coursing river.

738
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,660
Be a man!

739
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,760
With all the force of great typhoons.

740
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:27,920
Be a man!

741
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,420
With all the strength of raging fire.

742
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:36,260
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

743
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:46,660
Time is racing toward us, till the huns arrive.

744
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:55,060
Heed my every order, and you might survive.

745
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:00,540
You're the suit and board, the rage of war.

746
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,560
So pack up, go home, you're through.

747
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:11,220
How could I, out of you?

748
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,140
Be a man!

749
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:17,660
We must be swift as the coursing river.

750
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,340
Be a man!

751
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,540
With all the force of great typhoons.

752
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:22,660
Be a man!

753
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,120
With all the strength of raging fire.

754
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:31,620
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

755
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:35,520
Be a man!

756
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,460
We must be swift as the coursing river.

757
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:39,760
Be a man!

758
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,020
With all the force of great typhoons.

759
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:43,880
Be a man!

760
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,260
With all the strength of raging fire.

761
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,380
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon.

762
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,040
Yeah!

763
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,660
Next Mulan song, sorry.

764
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:06,360
The song is so cute.

765
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:16,670
For a long time we've been marching off to battle.

766
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:22,270
In our thundering herd, we feel a lot like cattle.

767
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:29,090
Like the pounding beat, our aching feet are easy to ignore.

768
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:29,850
Hey!

769
01:11:30,430 --> 01:11:33,610
Think of instead, a girl worth fighting for.

770
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:36,270
Huh?

771
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:40,010
That's what I said, a girl worth fighting for.

772
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:46,770
I want her paler than the moon, with eyes that shine like stars.

773
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:51,650
My girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scars.

774
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:56,870
I couldn't care less what she'll wear, or what she'll look like.

775
01:11:56,870 --> 01:12:02,590
It all depends on what she cooks, like beef, pork, chicken.

776
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:12,310
But the local girls thought you were quite the charmer.

777
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:17,370
And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor.

778
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:24,290
Yes we, we have missed them all since we went off to war.

779
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:25,950
What do we want?

780
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,770
A girl worth fighting for.

781
01:12:29,030 --> 01:12:34,490
My girl will think I have no faults, that I'm a major find.

782
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:41,470
How about a girl who has a brain, who always speaks her mind?

783
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:47,570
Nah, my manly ways and turn of phrase are sure to thrill her.

784
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:51,050
Who thinks he's such a lady killer?

785
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:57,510
How about a girl back home who's unlike any other?

786
01:12:58,870 --> 01:13:02,730
You're the only girl who loves him as his mother.

787
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:09,290
Whether we come home in victory, the lineup at the door.

788
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:11,270
What do we want?

789
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:14,390
A girl worth fighting for.

790
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:18,830
Wish that I had a girl worth fighting for.

791
01:13:21,590 --> 01:13:24,450
A girl worth fighting...

792
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:27,070
Cut off.

793
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,730
Mito's having too much fun with the lyrics.

794
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:33,030
This is such a funny song.

795
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:33,370
No!

796
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:38,150
It's so funny.

797
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,250
It's so funny.

798
01:13:42,850 --> 01:13:45,050
You guys, recently...

799
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:47,210
I didn't used to have... Oh my gosh.

800
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:49,470
One day, I was scrolling through TikTok.

801
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:52,890
And suddenly, I started getting videos of me!

802
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:55,710
Oh my gosh, Invisible Boots, thank you for the Akatsuba, thank you!

803
01:13:55,910 --> 01:13:57,110
Also, also...

804
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:00,670
Bane, thank you for the Akatsuba, thank you so so much!

805
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,170
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

806
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,730
It was mid-song, so I didn't get to thank you.

807
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:07,990
But I started getting videos of me!

808
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,710
I was like, no way, this is so weird.

809
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,730
But it's a bunch of my karaoke.

810
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:15,830
And sometimes, I look through the comments once and I was like...

811
01:14:15,830 --> 01:14:16,810
What are people saying?

812
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:17,370
I'm kind of curious.

813
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:45,280
I just put in the daisuki, but it was just suki.

814
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:46,260
It's okay.

815
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:47,960
It's okay.

816
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:54,200
Mama!

817
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:56,940
Everybody say hello to Ayami Mama.

818
01:14:57,980 --> 01:15:01,840
Also, go subscribe to Ayami Mama if you're not already subscribed.

819
01:15:02,180 --> 01:15:05,140
If you subscribe to Ayami Mama, you become her boyfriend.

820
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,660
I'm her boyfriend daughter.

821
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,960
Mama, do you have a song you want to listen to?

822
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:19,320
Mama, do you have a song you want to listen to?

823
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:28,410
After all those Mulan songs, I got enough proteins to be above Minto.

824
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:37,810
Mama, I'm subscribing right now.

825
01:15:38,690 --> 01:15:39,970
Oh my gosh.

826
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,270
Yeah, you finally have a girlfriend.

827
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:48,790
Did she leave?

828
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:50,910
Did she leave?

829
01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:55,430
She came, dropped the akasupa, and left.

830
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:56,890
Oh, okay.

831
01:16:01,910 --> 01:16:02,850
She's gone.

832
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:07,410
Subscribe, don't be jealous.

833
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:08,610
What do you mean jealous?

834
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:09,450
Of what?

835
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:11,010
Oh,

836
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:20,760
she's here.

837
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:22,360
She's still here.

838
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,120
Mama, do you have a song you want to listen to?

839
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,560
In English, Japanese, whatever.

840
01:16:35,530 --> 01:16:37,130
English, okay.

841
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,550
English, okay.

842
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:40,610
English.

843
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:42,110
What song?

844
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:48,710
English.

845
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:53,370
I hope you can sing Pollyanna, I Believe In You from mother vocal tracks.

846
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:55,230
I don't know that.

847
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:00,050
I know.

848
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,710
Hamtaro!

849
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,790
Is that English?

850
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,290
English, okay.

851
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,530
Hamtaro!

852
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:19,370
Hamtaro!

853
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:20,790
Hamtaro!

854
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:27,790
There

855
01:17:30,890 --> 01:17:32,470
we go.

856
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:34,070
Sorry.

857
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:35,950
Why sorry?

858
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:36,030
Sorry.

859
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:38,870
I will sing!

860
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:41,290
Hamtaro Totoko Uta!

861
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:44,970
English!

862
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:46,390
Can I do it?

863
01:17:46,990 --> 01:17:51,990
English, Hamtaro Totoko Uta.

864
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,250
I wonder if I can make up the English.

865
01:17:57,490 --> 01:17:59,110
Okay, I'm gonna do my best.

866
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,830
English And here we are, running, Hamtaro.

867
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,830
Trotting, let's turn around, Hamtaro.

868
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:41,250
Turning while painting, Hamtaro.

869
01:18:42,110 --> 01:18:47,310
I really like sunflower seeds.

870
01:18:48,250 --> 01:18:51,610
Turn around and be happy, Hamtaro.

871
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,430
Trotting, let's sleep, Hamtaro.

872
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:01,890
No matter where, let's sleep, Hamtaro.

873
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:08,230
I really like sunflower seeds.

874
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:12,170
Me too, indeed we are sleeping, Hamtaro.

875
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:15,350
Trotting, let's turn around, Hamtaro.

876
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:18,650
No, it's not Oremo.

877
01:19:19,290 --> 01:19:19,850
It's not Oremo.

878
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,350
It's me too.

879
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:31,200
Get ready, sunflower seeds, me too!

880
01:19:34,550 --> 01:19:39,030
I don't know how...how would you translate any of the calls.

881
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:42,730
Good job!

882
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:44,170
Thank you, Mama!

883
01:19:44,890 --> 01:19:45,870
Thank you!

884
01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:47,650
Hakuna Matata.

885
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,410
It means no worries.

886
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:54,230
Hamtaro, trotting, let's sing.

887
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,130
Me too!

888
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:02,690
Thank you, Mama!

889
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:03,990
Thank you, Mama!

890
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:05,350
Thank you, Mama!

891
01:20:05,490 --> 01:20:05,950
Thank you, Mama!

892
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:06,770
Thank you, Mama!

893
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:08,810
Happy one, Minki.

894
01:20:09,230 --> 01:20:09,870
Two different suggestions.

895
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:12,290
Linger by Cranberries, Ojamajo Carnival.

896
01:20:13,410 --> 01:20:16,130
Yeah, I can do probably Linger, Ojamajo Carnival.

897
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,130
I tried singing that before, no?

898
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:26,410
I always like forget how that song goes until I hear it.

899
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,550
But even still, let me try.

900
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:32,770

01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,020

Doushiyou, dousuru?

906
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:54,880
Bikkuri, bikkuri, bing, bing.

907

01:21:49,660 --> 01:21:51,120
Ike, pika, pikara.

918
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,620

Pizza, pizza, la, la.

931
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,080
How do you hold on?

932
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,520
How do you sing that part?

933
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:33,470
Wait.

934
01:24:40,910 --> 01:24:43,230

Yeah.

943
01:25:06,510 --> 01:25:10,570
Sophie, so blessed I saw you in concert twice and got to experience the legendary Hamtaro circle.

944
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,750
I love Hamtaro circle.

945
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:16,870
Yay, thank you!

01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:20,540

01:25:24,910 --> 01:25:26,710
Don't tell lies.

949
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:29,570
Don't tell lies.

950
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:34,530
Things like, that was perfect or Minto cute.

951
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:37,290
Don't say lies, don't say lies.

952
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:37,970
Okay.

953
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:47,840
I wanna sing, someone recommended this a while ago and I wanna sing it.

954
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,860
I wanna try singing it.

955
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:56,280
I wanna try singing it.

956
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,080
Okay.

957
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,620
Kawaii toka, motetai toka.

01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,070

01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:35,010
Koukasan, kureta ato.

974

Mitsu shite mo, watashi rashiku ikou.

975

Mune watte, ikiru.

Zarakedaseba, kokoro ga tatakarete tanda.

977
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:57,800
Suki ni itero, itakunai.

Sekai wo terashita, mune ga odoru.

Ai toka, motetai toka.

986
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:48,770
Onnanoko dashi, shiorashiku.

987
01:29:49,330 --> 01:29:52,650
Nekokaburi, number one deshou.

988
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,630
Aishite ne, ikikata wa.

989
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:58,970
Mugen ni aru, koto san no.

990
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:02,090
Ogeasa kotoba, ichi rashiku.

991
01:30:02,950 --> 01:30:06,030
Nekokaburi, watashi rashiku ikou.

Ima janai, jinsei.

993
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:11,450
Ikiyo!

994
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:29,520
Sorry, I kind of scuffed that one.

995
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:31,680
It's been a long time since I've sung it.

996
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:35,480
Thank you so much for the first ever super chat.

997
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,960
And also...

998
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,620
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

999
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,720
Thank you so much, oh my goodness.

1000
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:43,260
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1001
01:30:43,400 --> 01:30:44,700
I really appreciate it.

1002
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:50,280
Oh, I forgot to put...

1003
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:53,560
Ojamajo Carnival.

1004
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,300
And then...

1005
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,540
Number one, that was Honeyworks.

1006
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,820
Number one, number one.

1007
01:31:02,180 --> 01:31:03,940
Happy when you're back, thank you!

1008
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,820
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1009
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,500
I'll sing Under Pressure by Bowie and Queen.

1010
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:13,680
I don't know if I can sing it well though, I know it's a hard song.

1011
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,920
What if I did another one?

1012
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:24,840
What's another Queen or David Bowie song?

1013
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:28,200
Tenacious D, oh yeah, that's right, someone requested that so long ago.

1014
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:37,230
I think this is the only song I can remember.

1015
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:38,130
Maybe this?

1016
01:31:40,130 --> 01:31:42,170
Actually, I don't remember if I know how it goes.

1017
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:43,930
I'll try it.

1018
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:45,310
It's a lot of talking though.

1019
01:31:56,770 --> 01:32:00,210
This is the greatest and best song in the world.

1020
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:05,750
Tribute.

1021
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,790
We was hitchhiking down a long...

1022
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:18,510
A long and lonesome road.

1023
01:32:20,210 --> 01:32:22,190
All of a sudden...

1024
01:32:22,790 --> 01:32:25,190
There shined a shiny beam...

1025
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:28,210
In the middle of the road.

1026
01:32:29,690 --> 01:32:31,190
And he said...

1027
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:34,090
Play the best song...

1028
01:32:34,090 --> 01:32:35,570
I don't remember how this part goes at all.

1029
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,770
Or I'll eat your soul.

1030
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:44,130
Well me and Kyle...

1031
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:47,050
We looked at each other...

1032
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:50,650
And we each said...

1033
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,130
Okay.

1034
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:54,670
And we played the first thing that came to our heads.

1035
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:56,530
Just so happened to be...

1036
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:59,190
The best song in the world.

1037
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:02,070
It was the best song in the world.

1038
01:33:02,670 --> 01:33:04,910
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see.

1039
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:07,510
When one makes two, two and one makes three.

1040
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:08,630
It was destiny.

1041
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:12,710
Every hundred thousand years or so.

1042
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:15,270
When the sun don't shine and the moon don't glow.

1043
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:17,010
When the grass don't grow.

1044
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:23,030
Needless to say...

1045
01:33:23,650 --> 01:33:25,250
The beast was stunned.

1046
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:28,330
With crack on his whoopee tail.

1047
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,390
And the beast was done.

1048
01:33:31,950 --> 01:33:34,310
He asked us...

1049
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:35,810
Be you angels?

1050
01:33:35,810 --> 01:33:38,290
And we say nay.

1051
01:33:38,910 --> 01:33:40,690
We are but men.

1052
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:55,650
This is not the greatest song in the world.

1053
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:58,810
This is just a tribute.

1054
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:02,990
Couldn't remember.

1055
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:05,350
The greatest song in the world.

1056
01:34:07,090 --> 01:34:08,850
And oh, this is a tribute.

1057
01:34:14,110 --> 01:34:16,410
Butchard, I told you I don't remember it.

1058
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:19,290
It was the greatest song in the

1059
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:26,180
world.

1060
01:34:42,010 --> 01:34:44,030
It's a tribute to tribute, yeah.

1061
01:34:44,910 --> 01:34:46,010
A particular thing.

1062
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,170
We sang on that fateful night.

1063
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:52,070
Didn't actually sound anything like this song.

1064
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:54,230
This is just a tribute.

1065
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:56,970
You gotta believe it.

1066
01:34:57,370 --> 01:34:59,310
And I wish you were there.

1067
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:01,370
It's a matter of opinion.

1068
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:14,110
Do they always cuss so much in this song?

1069
01:35:36,610 --> 01:35:38,390
I'm not even gonna put that on the list.

1070
01:35:38,650 --> 01:35:39,590
I couldn't remember it.

1071
01:35:39,910 --> 01:35:41,970
I could only remember the talking part, which is so funny.

1072
01:35:43,790 --> 01:35:47,810
I could only remember the talking parts.

1073
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:51,870
Silly.

1074
01:35:52,990 --> 01:35:54,190
It's just your style.

1075
01:35:54,190 --> 01:35:58,870
It was my own rendition of Tribute of Tribute.

1076
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:07,590
And then it gets so crazy because it's all like...

1077
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,090
Not improv.

1078
01:36:12,490 --> 01:36:13,690
What's the word?

1079
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:17,410
Improvisation?

1080
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:17,770
No.

1081
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,370
Adlibs, yeah.

1082
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:23,270
Adlibbing.

1083
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:24,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1084
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:25,430
It all becomes like that.

1085
01:36:26,210 --> 01:36:28,990
I can try Dreams by Fleetwood.

1086
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:32,770
That was just a tribute.

1087
01:37:32,300 --> 01:37:34,140
Sorry, the timing for this song is weird.

1088
01:38:12,690 --> 01:38:16,910
Sand washes, you'll clean, you'll know

1089
01:38:20,990 --> 01:38:43,770
The crystal vision spins

1090
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:48,650
to myself

1091
01:38:52,010 --> 01:39:10,830
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams And have you any dreams you'd like to sell Dreams of loneliness, like a heartbeat, drives you mad.

1092
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:30,050
In the stillness of remembering what you had, me, and what you lost, and what you had, what you love, depends

1093
01:39:34,780 --> 01:39:36,500
when it's raining.

1094
01:39:40,430 --> 01:39:43,610
They'll only love you when their

1095
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,960
pain washes you clean.

1096
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:32,270
When their pain washes you clean, you'll know.

1097
01:40:37,810 --> 01:40:39,910
You will know.

1098
01:40:53,750 --> 01:41:03,050
I see something in the, like, suggested that, like, on the carophon, but I want to sing...

1099
01:41:03,050 --> 01:41:08,530
Can't sing one Fleetwood Mac song without singing my other favorite Fleetwood Mac song.

1100
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:16,250
Thank you for the Haka Super.

1101
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:17,670
Thank you!

1102
01:41:19,410 --> 01:41:20,410
Climbed

1103
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:50,810
a mountain on a turbulent route And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills Till the landslide brought me down Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?

1104
01:41:52,290 --> 01:41:57,710
Can the child within my heart rise from the ground?

1105
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:04,550
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?

1106
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:11,950
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

1107
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:50,030
Afraid of changing, cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder, even children get older And I'm getting older too September 19th Afraid

1108
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:32,800
of changing, cause I've built my life around you But time makes you bolder, even children get older And I'm getting older too

1109
01:43:52,250 --> 01:44:03,050
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills Will the landslide bring me down?

1110
01:44:04,870 --> 01:44:17,350
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills Will the landslide bring me down?

1111
01:44:20,310 --> 01:44:23,110
Oh, landslide bring me down

1112
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:29,220
Yay!

1113
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:39,600
Okay, so when I searched dreams, I got this other song And I was like, oh my gosh, I have to sing this song Because I thought about this song not too long ago And I was like, I wanna sing this song in karaoke!

1114
01:44:40,260 --> 01:44:42,720
Some of you guys might be like, what the hell?

1115
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:53,780
I'm too young for this song But us old people get it Hey now, hey now Have

1116
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:05,250
you ever seen such a beautiful night?

1117
01:45:07,670 --> 01:46:09,430
I could almost kiss the stars for shining so bright Then I see you smile and I go, oh, oh, oh I would never want to miss this Cause in my heart I know what this is Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong Somebody to love This is what dreams are made of This is what dreams are made of Have you ever wondered what life is all about?

1118
01:46:11,630 --> 01:47:01,970
You could search the world and never figure it out You don't have to sail the oceans No, no, no Happiness is no mystery It's here and now It's you and me, yeah Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong I've got somebody to love This is what dreams are made of Hey now,

1119
01:47:02,430 --> 01:47:04,470
hey now This

1120
01:47:11,030 --> 01:47:41,550
is what dreams are made of Shout to the skies This is what dreams are made of As I see you smile, I go, oh, oh, oh Yesterday my life was duller Now everything's technicolor This

1121
01:47:44,830 --> 01:48:17,110
is what dreams are made of Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of I've got somewhere I belong I've got somebody to love This is what dreams Dreams This is what dreams Are made of

1122
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:32,720
Hey now, hey now This is what dreams are made of Hey now

1123
01:48:50,940 --> 01:49:04,990
You know, actually, when I was a wee wisp, I did not have Disney Channel So, I only knew about this song because I would go to a friend's house and she'd be like Let's watch the Lizzie McGuire movie!

1124
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:06,490
And I'd be like, okay!

1125
01:49:08,430 --> 01:49:12,450
Can I humbly request Funky Monkey Baby's Chipoke song?

1126
01:49:12,990 --> 01:49:14,910
Yeah, Gliss, that's such a good one

1127
01:49:19,350 --> 01:49:22,150
I wonder if they have it on here Damn, they don't.

1128
01:49:22,210 --> 01:49:22,750
Ok, hold on.

1129
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:30,370
Wait a minute Funky Monkey Baby's You guys know Funky Monkey Baby's?

1130
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:35,350
I know this song so well.

1131
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:36,650
Only Chipoke no Uta.

1132
01:49:36,710 --> 01:50:03,270
I know the rest of the Funky Monkey Baby's songs too, but only I know Chipoke no Uta so well Because when I was in school, my Japanese teacher would literally play this song every single day and make us sing it Every single day He was like, this is how you will be good at speaking in Japanese Puppy Monkey?

1133
01:50:03,410 --> 01:50:13,290
No, Funky Monkey Baby's Chipoke no Uta Hold on, I gotta get the lyrics.

1134
01:50:13,450 --> 01:50:15,110
Ok, wait, that's not it

1135
01:50:21,640 --> 01:50:22,680
Did it help?

1136
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,420
I think so.

1137
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:34,340
Well, I think it helps a lot with pronunciation, you know But also, the lyrics to this song are just so sweet So, sorry if I messed it up in advance.

1138
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:37,120
I probably will, but...

1139
01:50:38,220 --> 01:50:42,340
It's probably also not gonna be the right... Wait, do I have my old one?

1140
01:50:42,480 --> 01:50:45,560
Hold on The one I used to use

1141
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:56,200
Wait, music, karaoke Old karaoke.

1142
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:56,960
Oh my gosh!

1143
01:50:57,080 --> 01:51:01,620
Wait, no, wait No, I don't have it.

1144
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:02,400
Sad

1145
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:06,820
Oh well.

1146
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:09,060
Wait, I don't have it.

1147
01:51:09,360 --> 01:51:10,300
Oh well

1148
01:51:20,130 --> 01:51:21,290
I'll sing it anyway

1149
01:51:29,490 --> 01:51:29,790
I don't have it

1150
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:54,010
So, are you ok?

1151
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:40,520
I've got so

1152
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:49,460
much spit in my mouth

1153
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:24,900
It was just accumulating.

1154
01:54:25,020 --> 01:54:26,080
I had no time to swallow

1155
01:56:24,910 --> 01:56:32,570
I'll do just a few more songs Just a few more I recommend Funky Monkey Papers.

1156
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,370
All their songs are so inspirational.

1157
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:38,570
They're so like, wow Funky Monkey Babies.

1158
01:56:38,610 --> 01:56:39,370
And they're so cool.

1159
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:41,810
And I like their style a lot

1160
01:56:45,610 --> 01:56:48,550
So good Was your teacher a sadist?

1161
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:52,030
Maybe I loved my teacher though.

1162
01:56:52,090 --> 01:56:53,230
He was so cool.

1163
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:56,390
He was so funny I have another song though I do want to sing actually, this one.

1164
01:56:56,750 --> 01:56:57,410

Wait, I'm so in love with that one song I don't...

What's that?

1174
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:51,130
I

1175
01:57:57,010 --> 01:57:58,530
don't know how it goes.

1176
01:57:58,830 --> 01:57:59,310
Wait, hold on.

1177

01:59:46,750 --> 01:59:48,730
I don't really know that one though.

1192
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:50,030
Is this the Odyssey?

1193
01:59:50,330 --> 01:59:51,170
Yes, actually!

1194
01:59:54,170 --> 01:59:54,970
It's so good.

1195
01:59:55,170 --> 01:59:59,290
I just did it off the top of my head though.

1196
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:01,890
Sorry, I kind of butchered it.

1197
02:00:04,330 --> 02:00:08,630
Okay, I sing one of my favorite songs ever.

1198
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:03,700
It's called Kuchizuke Kibonnu.

1199
02:01:03,720 --> 02:01:13,320
Kuroeba samishiku naru Karafuru na omoide ga

1200
02:01:16,410 --> 02:01:36,750
Manjushu to eien wa Tsuzukanai mono de Ima te to te ga Fureatta no wa I don't know what I was thinking, but you came out of nowhere.

1201
02:01:41,670 --> 02:01:44,150
It's almost time to kiss,

1202
02:01:49,170 --> 02:01:51,970
but you're

1203
02:02:15,130 --> 02:02:15,390
not here today.

1204
02:02:15,430 --> 02:02:17,130
It's so noisy and quiet.

1205
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:19,210
School and friends.

1206
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:20,790
The cold wind is blowing.

1207
02:02:21,310 --> 02:02:21,970
Now,

1208
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:38,280
this moment, look, the distance

1209
02:02:42,430 --> 02:02:42,910
is...

1210
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:45,190
The two of us, the two of us...

1211
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:44,080
I don't know what I was thinking.

1212
02:04:58,950 --> 02:05:00,070
I want to kiss you.

1213
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:07,030
Thanks for the raid, sorry!

1214
02:05:07,530 --> 02:05:10,050
Sorry, I didn't see who raided me, but thank you!

1215
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:11,930
Miracle Hinako.

1216
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:26,340
Miracle Hinako.

1217
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:28,020
I haven't heard that song in years.

1218
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,340
I wonder if I can remember it.

1219
02:05:35,600 --> 02:05:39,860
Wait a second, oh my gosh, I looked up Miracle Hinako and Kiwawa sang it?

1220
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:43,120
Kiara sings Miracle Hinako.

1221
02:05:43,380 --> 02:05:43,660
What?

1222
02:05:44,500 --> 02:05:45,440
Why did Kiara...

1223
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:46,160
What?

1224
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:47,280
Kiara knows this song?

1225
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,020
Kiara knows Touhou?

1226
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:50,140
What?

1227
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:53,720
When?

1228
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:57,140
It says from three years ago, holy moly.

1229
02:05:58,840 --> 02:06:02,040
Wait, I have a song that I really wanted to sing.

1230
02:06:04,040 --> 02:06:04,900
Hold on.

1231
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:11,640
I wonder if I can sing it.

1232
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,560
Hold on.

1233
02:06:15,280 --> 02:06:16,620
Let me hear how it goes real quick.

1234
02:06:17,540 --> 02:06:19,180
Let me hear how it goes real quick.

1235
02:06:23,510 --> 02:06:24,910
Hold on, I'm listening.

1236
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:33,070
Sorry, it's not Touhou, but...

1237
02:06:36,250 --> 02:06:38,530
I think I might be able to remember it.

1238
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,280
I'm happy.

1239
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:47,940
I might butcher this.

1240
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:51,240
I might butcher this.

1241
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:54,840
Touhou 1...

1242
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,760
Touhou M1 with Komachi and Shiki Eiki binary drop.

1243
02:07:00,740 --> 02:07:02,600
Binary drop, that sounds familiar.

1244
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:03,040
Hold on.

1245
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:04,460
Binary drop.

1246
02:07:17,850 --> 02:07:19,630
Oh my god.

1247
02:07:22,550 --> 02:07:24,430
I think Wawa streamed Touhou Spellbubble.

1248
02:07:24,610 --> 02:07:25,590
Oh, I see.

1249
02:07:26,490 --> 02:07:27,410
Thank you so much.

1250
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:32,490
You made...

1251
02:07:32,490 --> 02:07:34,430
Wait, you have just made me so happy.

1252
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:35,710
So much joy with that piece of epic.

1253
02:07:35,850 --> 02:07:37,730
Now it's a life goal of mine to hear you sing more of it.

1254
02:07:37,790 --> 02:07:39,990
Oh my gosh, I don't know so many of the epic songs.

1255
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:42,050
I actually have not listened to like the...

1256
02:07:42,050 --> 02:07:43,070
To the...

1257
02:07:43,070 --> 02:07:43,910
To the...

1258
02:07:43,910 --> 02:07:44,430
What's it called?

1259
02:07:44,890 --> 02:07:46,470
The actual musical itself.

1260
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,010
So...

1261
02:07:49,010 --> 02:07:51,610
But I can try learning it maybe.

1262
02:07:59,140 --> 02:08:00,700
Hold on, I'm...

1263
02:08:05,230 --> 02:08:06,010
Wait, wait.

1264
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:07,010
Bubble, bubble, bubble.

1265
02:08:07,010 --> 02:08:07,410
Hold on.

1266
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:11,190
Why isn't this...

1267
02:08:11,190 --> 02:08:11,930
Oh, there we go.

1268
02:08:15,350 --> 02:08:15,990
There we go.

1269
02:08:16,050 --> 02:08:17,450
I'm gonna try and sing this song.

1270
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:21,250
I might not do it very well, but...

1271
02:08:23,030 --> 02:08:23,970
But I'm gonna try.

1272
02:08:26,410 --> 02:08:27,850
Minto choice, yeah.

1273
02:08:28,730 --> 02:08:29,730
Minto choice of song.

1274
02:08:30,170 --> 02:08:31,530
Some of you might recognize this.

1275
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,760
Oh my gosh.

1276
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:14,740
She has...

1277
02:09:32,640 --> 02:09:34,680
I can't remember it.

1278
02:10:04,250 --> 02:10:05,210
I can't remember.

1279
02:11:04,350 --> 02:11:06,830
It's funny because I listen to this song...

1280
02:11:06,830 --> 02:11:09,050
I listen to this song so often.

1281
02:11:09,050 --> 02:11:12,990
Like when I'm just doing work, it's so pretty.

1282
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:14,490
So I just have it on in the background.

1283
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:15,630
But I think it just doesn't...

1284
02:11:15,630 --> 02:11:16,970
It's stuck in my brain.

1285
02:11:18,690 --> 02:11:21,090
And then of course I hear it when...

1286
02:11:21,570 --> 02:11:22,050
When...

1287
02:11:22,050 --> 02:11:24,390
Dress Hina is on my menu.

1288
02:11:24,930 --> 02:11:25,970
In Blue Archive.

1289
02:11:27,310 --> 02:11:27,990
What is it called?

1290
02:11:28,310 --> 02:11:31,010
Yumeji no Hana is from Blue Archive.

1291
02:11:32,970 --> 02:11:33,710
You're right!

1292
02:11:33,950 --> 02:11:37,770
Even Hina had to practice it over and over multiple days to get it right.

1293
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:39,850
Yeah, I'm in my Hina...

1294
02:11:39,850 --> 02:11:41,150
In my Hina arch.

1295
02:11:41,890 --> 02:11:43,390
But it's such a pretty song.

1296
02:11:43,450 --> 02:11:44,750
I want to sing it right next time.

1297
02:11:44,990 --> 02:11:45,250
And!

1298
02:11:45,430 --> 02:11:45,810
And!

1299
02:11:46,070 --> 02:11:46,410
And!

1300
02:11:46,530 --> 02:11:50,710
It is composed by the same composer of my intro music.

1301
02:11:50,830 --> 02:11:52,090
My intro BDM.

1302
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:53,130
Mitsukio-san!

1303
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:55,650
So...

1304
02:11:55,650 --> 02:11:56,610
It's really, really pretty.

1305
02:11:56,730 --> 02:12:00,470
Maybe one day I can ask Mitsukio-san to make me kind of like a ballad-like song.

1306
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:02,990
Something like that would be really nice.

1307
02:12:04,050 --> 02:12:06,910
Anything he composes is so beautiful.

1308
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:12,770
Mitsukio-san is so true.

1309
02:12:20,090 --> 02:12:21,110
Happy one year!

1310
02:12:21,490 --> 02:12:22,170
Thank you!

1311
02:12:22,810 --> 02:12:23,190
Thank you!

1312
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:23,790
Thank you!

1313
02:12:24,130 --> 02:12:24,950
I won't put that on.

1314
02:12:24,990 --> 02:12:25,750
I won't count that.

1315
02:12:25,770 --> 02:12:28,150
I won't count that since I didn't do it so properly.

1316
02:12:34,310 --> 02:12:35,690
I hope you stay a while longer.

1317
02:12:35,810 --> 02:12:36,230
I will.

1318
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:38,650
I'll be around for a bit maybe.

1319
02:12:42,110 --> 02:12:45,190
Since I was going to do a kind of slow song...

1320
02:12:45,730 --> 02:12:50,050
Here is another slow song that I sometimes sing.

1321
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:53,210
Maybe you guys know it.

1322
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:34,860
Just me, just me, just me, just me And I'll be fine on the outside

1323
02:13:37,870 --> 02:13:58,130
And I like to eat in school by myself anyway So I'll just stay right here, right here, right here

1324
02:14:05,930 --> 02:14:24,530
on the outside So I just sit in my room after hours with the moon And think of who knows my name Would you cry if I died?

1325
02:14:24,670 --> 02:14:29,730
Would you remember my face?

1326
02:14:45,390 --> 02:14:52,010
So I left home, I packed up and I moved far

1327
02:14:55,720 --> 02:15:01,840
Past one day and I laughed

1328
02:15:36,850 --> 02:15:51,950
Sometimes I feel lost, sometimes I'm confused Sometimes I find that I am not alright So

1329
02:16:28,930 --> 02:16:43,590
I just sit in my room after hours with the moon And think of who knows my name Would you cry if I died?

1330
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:49,530
Would you remember my face?

1331
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:08,370
We are not on Kuchikakebondo, we were on...

1332
02:17:09,230 --> 02:17:20,050
That was fine on the outside Now this last song I sang recently in a karaoke, I wonder if I can do it again Thank you!

1333
02:17:20,430 --> 02:17:20,830
Thank you!

1334
02:17:20,830 --> 02:17:21,110
Thank you!

1335
02:17:23,930 --> 02:17:41,950
Frank Sinatra's My Way for the occasion OK I wonder if I can hit the notes though Let me sing this one song and then I'll sing My Way I've been stressful day at work.

1336
02:17:42,210 --> 02:17:42,690
Fuse!

1337
02:17:42,990 --> 02:17:43,010
No!

1338
02:17:43,810 --> 02:17:44,330
Otsu!

1339
02:17:44,430 --> 02:17:44,550
Otsu!

1340
02:17:44,810 --> 02:17:45,130
Otsu!

1341
02:17:45,630 --> 02:17:57,710
I sang this one recently in a karaoke Well, not karaoke, it was in a member stream So I'm going to sing it again Because I like this song

1342
02:18:23,170 --> 02:19:00,170
I was the one who had it all I was the master of my fate I never needed anybody in my life I learned the truth too late I'll never shake away the pain I close my eyes but she's still there I let her steal into my melancholy heart It's more than I can bear.

1343
02:19:02,690 --> 02:19:11,450
Now I know she'll never leave me, Even as she runs away.

1344
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:21,710
She will still torment me, Call me, hurt me, move me, come what may.

1345
02:19:22,210 --> 02:19:31,310
Wasting in my lonely tower, Waiting by an open door.

1346
02:19:31,730 --> 02:19:39,990
I'll fool myself, she'll walk right in, And be with me forevermore.

1347
02:19:44,230 --> 02:19:51,530
I rage against the trials of love, I curse the fading of the light.

1348
02:19:53,070 --> 02:20:02,930
Though she's already flown so far beyond my reach, She's never out of sight.

1349
02:20:03,770 --> 02:20:11,110
Now I know she'll never leave me, Even as she fades.

1350
02:20:11,230 --> 02:20:11,990
Oh, sorry.

1351
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:12,630
Oh, God.

1352
02:20:14,290 --> 02:20:15,170
I don't know.

1353
02:20:15,410 --> 02:20:15,970
Oh, gosh.

1354
02:20:15,990 --> 02:20:17,830
I don't know if I can hit the high notes today, you guys.

1355
02:20:17,970 --> 02:20:18,590
Oh, my God.

1356
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:29,060
I'm so embarrassed.

1357
02:20:31,620 --> 02:20:32,820
Sorry, I can't hit them.

1358
02:20:33,140 --> 02:20:34,040
I can't hit it.

1359
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:36,100
I can't hit it because of the pollen.

1360
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:38,540
I don't want to force it.

1361
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:44,880
I tried.

1362
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:46,980
I don't think I can hit it my way too then.

1363
02:20:50,080 --> 02:20:52,080
Dusko my wife!

1364
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:56,080
Sorry, I tried.

1365
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:58,680
You know I can hit it usually because...

1366
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:01,580
Because I've done it before.

1367
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:07,160
I don't know if I can hit it.

1368
02:21:11,910 --> 02:21:13,050
I'm so sorry.

1369
02:21:13,570 --> 02:21:14,610
Now I don't know what I'm on.

1370
02:21:17,530 --> 02:21:21,590
I went outside and literally I was coughing and sneezing so much.

1371
02:21:22,150 --> 02:21:24,190
Because it was just all getting in my throat.

1372
02:21:25,450 --> 02:21:28,310
I'll wait until all the pollen is gone to do another karaoke.

1373
02:21:35,540 --> 02:21:36,620
Yeah, you're so right.

1374
02:21:36,700 --> 02:21:37,800
We have to end on that.

1375
02:21:38,620 --> 02:21:39,980
You are so right.

1376
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:41,960
Morita!

1377
02:21:42,580 --> 02:21:43,500
Thank you for the Aka.

1378
02:21:43,720 --> 02:21:45,200
The pink, not Aka.

1379
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,140
Sorry, I can't see anything.

1380
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:48,320
Thank you for the pink!

1381
02:21:48,420 --> 02:21:49,280
So far, thank you!

1382
02:21:54,670 --> 02:21:56,090
Wait, I want to sing this one too.

1383
02:21:57,230 --> 02:21:59,750
OK, because I couldn't sing Evermore, I'll take that off the list.

1384
02:22:00,450 --> 02:22:02,110
Wow, I really thought I'd be able to hit it.

1385
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:02,870
I'm so dumb.

1386
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:05,410
I really thought I'd be able to hit it.

1387
02:22:05,410 --> 02:22:06,690
Wow, oh wow.

1388
02:22:07,130 --> 02:22:07,790
Thank you.

1389
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:10,690
Thank you, Digital.

1390
02:22:11,070 --> 02:22:12,070
Thank you so much.

1391
02:22:12,470 --> 02:22:12,950
Hold on.

1392
02:22:21,050 --> 02:22:21,770
Let me see.

1393
02:22:23,730 --> 02:22:24,550
I will sing.

1394
02:22:24,750 --> 02:22:25,070
Hold on.

1395
02:22:25,410 --> 02:22:27,330
Let me make sure this is the right version.

1396
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:36,300
OK, I'll sing this song instead.

1397
02:22:40,160 --> 02:22:42,300
I'll sing, but I'm not going to end on this.

1398
02:22:44,020 --> 02:22:45,100
Thank you for the Aka.

1399
02:22:45,220 --> 02:22:46,900
So far, thank you, thank you, thank you!

1400
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:49,440
I'll sing.

1401
02:22:59,960 --> 02:23:01,520
Sorry, I just realized you couldn't hear it.

1402
02:23:02,340 --> 02:23:03,020
That's embarrassing.

1403
02:23:52,190 --> 02:23:52,750
Sorry.

1404
02:27:37,470 --> 02:27:38,890
Before I do the last song.

1405
02:27:39,890 --> 02:27:42,810
I have a letter for you guys that I wrote.

1406
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:45,890
Hold on, I got to get some...

1407
02:27:46,850 --> 02:27:52,110
I got to get some background music, some BGM that suits the mood.

1408
02:27:59,850 --> 02:28:01,470
OK, this should be good.

1409
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:03,670
My emotional background music.

1410
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:13,370
I wrote it because I'm not good at saying things.

1411
02:28:13,370 --> 02:28:18,270
So I was like, I should write something because I'll forget...

1412
02:28:24,560 --> 02:28:26,500
I didn't finish writing it.

1413
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:30,220
I was still in the middle of editing it.

1414
02:28:30,880 --> 02:28:32,000
Or typing it, rather.

1415
02:28:32,700 --> 02:28:34,740
Wait, I just wrote what I just wrote.

1416
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,700
I just wrote what I just said out loud.

1417
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,380
OK, there we go.

1418
02:28:42,540 --> 02:28:45,300
lol Do you guys do that too?

1419
02:28:45,420 --> 02:28:48,260
Where if you're talking and typing, you say what you're typing?

1420
02:28:48,820 --> 02:28:49,260
OK.

1421
02:28:56,790 --> 02:28:59,330
I'm not good at speaking and I get embarrassed.

1422
02:28:59,410 --> 02:29:00,750
So I'm not going to look at you guys.

1423
02:29:01,870 --> 02:29:02,810
I'm going to turn away.

1424
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:19,180
Because it's a special one year anniversary of me coming back.

1425
02:29:19,780 --> 02:29:21,940
I'm saying this letter.

1426
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:25,920
lol I'm not looking.

1427
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:35,680
To everybody who has supported me until now.

1428
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:44,760
I can't believe that it's already been a year since I've come back to streaming.

1429
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:49,900
You know, it feels so much shorter and also so much longer than that.

1430
02:29:49,900 --> 02:29:52,660
You know, so many things have happened.

1431
02:29:53,080 --> 02:29:54,540
I've gone to so many conventions.

1432
02:29:54,940 --> 02:29:58,640
I've held concerts and countless numbers of streams.

1433
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:03,800
In fact, I actually number my...

1434
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:04,420
Wait, let's see.

1435
02:30:04,760 --> 02:30:05,620
This is not in the letter.

1436
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,580
But I number my thumbnails.

1437
02:30:10,840 --> 02:30:14,620
And I missed a few because I was out of town or something.

1438
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:18,080
This today is number 226.

1439
02:30:20,240 --> 02:30:25,140
So that's a little less than, I guess, a year's worth of streams.

1440
02:30:25,920 --> 02:30:27,460
Oops, my bad.

1441
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:30,900
But like I said, I missed some.

1442
02:30:34,620 --> 02:30:35,140
226.

1443
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:43,860
But, you know, I missed a couple because they would be on like another computer or someplace else.

1444
02:30:43,860 --> 02:30:45,900
But, yeah.

1445
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:53,280
I've held concerts and countless streams and memories with new friends and all of you as well.

1446
02:30:54,620 --> 02:31:02,000
It doesn't matter if I label it as, you know, the afterlife because this is truly heaven to me.

1447
02:31:02,980 --> 02:31:04,820
There's so many things I could say.

1448
02:31:05,900 --> 02:31:07,820
So much to where it feels like, thank you.

1449
02:31:07,880 --> 02:31:08,580
Is it enough?

1450
02:31:08,580 --> 02:31:15,300
Is not great enough of a phrase to show how grateful I am for having spent all this time together?

1451
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:25,620
Whether you found me just a few months ago or four years ago, I am so undoubtedly grateful to each and every one of you.

1452
02:31:26,100 --> 02:31:31,060
And it's still so hard for me to believe that you'd allow me to take any space in your lives.

1453
02:31:31,060 --> 02:31:38,020
To me, I love idols so much and hold my Oshis with the deepest respect.

1454
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:46,740
And so it's a little unfathomable for me to think you'd do the same for me because I'm just a ghost after all.

1455
02:31:47,120 --> 02:31:56,040
And if you think about it, ghosts are actually quite pathetic because they're trapped in an in-between, unable to rest because of their regrets.

1456
02:31:56,040 --> 02:32:00,780
But for me, every day couldn't feel any more opposite.

1457
02:32:01,180 --> 02:32:03,660
And you guys say I'm tsundere, but I'm not.

1458
02:32:04,440 --> 02:32:11,320
It's just that I'm not good at expressing myself.

1459
02:32:12,080 --> 02:32:21,160
I know I can say a lot of things on stream, but I get really embarrassed talking about my real feelings, which is why I'm not looking at chat right now.

1460
02:32:23,960 --> 02:32:30,920
I'm sorry that I'm the type who wants to tease you and make fun of you more the more I like you.

1461
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:38,740
But I'm actually really self-conscious and needy and always worried you'll banish me and exorcise me out of your life.

1462
02:32:39,160 --> 02:32:43,680
And so I may talk a big game, but I'm not actually very brave at all.

1463
02:32:46,680 --> 02:32:59,900
But, you know, I'm not a brave ghost, but I'm forever grateful to Little Mint of the past for taking the step forward to this big adventure that we've all been able to experience together.

1464
02:33:01,880 --> 02:33:08,980
And I hope that you can also feel like when I have a victory, it's a victory for you and for this whole community as well.

1465
02:33:08,980 --> 02:33:21,180
And I hope that even in a little way, my silliness has inspired you to try something out of your comfort zone or something you've wanted to try to do since I did all the same.

1466
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:29,160
I did the same all those years ago, and I hope you've found yourself a little spot in this community that I hold so dear to me.

1467
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:34,180
So thank you, everyone, for all the support.

1468
02:33:34,640 --> 02:33:42,320
And I'll keep doing my best to deliver little bits of happiness to you all as much as I can every day.

1469
02:33:42,840 --> 02:33:43,800
Signed, Minto.

1470
02:33:58,370 --> 02:34:00,410
OK, goodbye, sappy music.

1471
02:34:03,170 --> 02:34:03,850
Goodbye.

1472
02:34:07,990 --> 02:34:11,130
Last song, last song, last song.

1473
02:34:13,510 --> 02:34:16,210
Last song, last song, last song.

1474
02:34:17,950 --> 02:34:29,310
Oh, also, I did want to say too, I guess, because I did have some stuff I wanted to have released today or planned for today, but it didn't all work out.

1475
02:34:29,410 --> 02:34:31,370
It's mostly my fault because I got so busy.

1476
02:34:32,730 --> 02:34:37,590
And I'm going to be honest, my next couple of months are going to be super duper busy.

1477
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:48,310
You might find me taking a little bit more breaks, but it's all for stuff that will hopefully you'll see and be like, wow, that's pretty cool thing Minto is doing.

1478
02:34:49,530 --> 02:34:58,850
But also, I feel I might need to take a few more breaks in the future just because I need to have my voice repair a little bit.

1479
02:34:58,970 --> 02:35:01,190
And I have so many things that I have to record.

1480
02:35:03,230 --> 02:35:07,890
So up until July, it's pretty really, really busy for me.

1481
02:35:08,610 --> 02:35:11,050
You guys will find out soon enough.

1482
02:35:12,510 --> 02:35:15,330
But so I apologize about that.

1483
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:16,010
I'm sorry.

1484
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:20,810
I'm sorry there will be more breaks up until July, really.

1485
02:35:21,250 --> 02:35:22,870
So I'm sorry, guys.

1486
02:35:22,870 --> 02:35:23,510
I'm sorry.

1487
02:35:25,270 --> 02:35:30,090
But it's like cool stuff I'm working on, you know.

1488
02:35:32,470 --> 02:35:32,810
So.

1489
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:35,850
Stop saying sorry, I can't help it.

1490
02:35:35,970 --> 02:35:37,710
Okay, I'm going to do a duet with myself.

1491
02:37:47,250 --> 02:37:49,110
Freaky ghost man.

1492
02:37:51,290 --> 02:37:53,270
Freaky man, baby.

1493
02:37:57,110 --> 02:37:58,430
Be all alone.

1494
02:37:59,350 --> 02:38:00,730
Let me sleep in your bed.

1495
02:38:05,890 --> 02:38:06,970
Let me tell you something.

1496
02:38:07,890 --> 02:38:09,910
Sleeping makes me feel good.

1497
02:38:14,250 --> 02:38:15,630
I ain't afraid of no sleep.

1498
02:38:16,230 --> 02:38:17,790
I ain't afraid of no bed.

1499
02:38:22,290 --> 02:38:23,710
An invisible bed.

1500
02:38:24,830 --> 02:38:26,750
Freaky ghost bed.

1501
02:38:26,930 --> 02:38:27,670
Yeah, yeah!

1502
02:38:33,110 --> 02:38:34,510
Busting, busting, busting.

1503
02:38:38,780 --> 02:38:40,270
Makes me feel good.

1504
02:38:40,490 --> 02:38:44,410
Feel good.

1505
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:47,630
Yeah, yeah.

1506
02:38:47,890 --> 02:38:49,330
Busting, busting.

1507
02:39:00,230 --> 02:39:00,670
Yeah,

1508
02:39:04,070 --> 02:39:04,630
yeah, yeah!

1509
02:39:07,650 --> 02:39:09,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1510
02:39:10,810 --> 02:39:11,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1511
02:39:11,970 --> 02:39:12,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1512
02:39:13,010 --> 02:39:13,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1513
02:39:13,910 --> 02:39:14,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1514
02:39:14,890 --> 02:39:15,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1515
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:17,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1516
02:39:17,070 --> 02:39:17,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1517
02:39:17,630 --> 02:39:17,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1518
02:39:17,890 --> 02:39:17,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1519
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1520
02:39:18,990 --> 02:39:19,950
Feel good.

1521
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,540
Must and must and makes me feel good.

1522
02:39:30,680 --> 02:39:31,600
Feel good.

1523
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:32,620
Feel good.

1524
02:39:32,900 --> 02:39:33,660
Feel good.

1525
02:39:33,920 --> 02:39:34,680
Feel good.

1526
02:39:34,940 --> 02:39:35,660
Feel good.

1527
02:39:35,960 --> 02:39:37,900
Must and must and makes me feel good.

1528
02:39:38,360 --> 02:39:38,800
It's over.

1529
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:41,400
Thank you everybody.

1530
02:39:44,690 --> 02:39:45,930
Thank you Overworld.

1531
02:39:46,050 --> 02:39:46,690
Thank you Fakedeet.

1532
02:39:46,850 --> 02:39:48,170
Thank you guys.

1533
02:39:48,490 --> 02:39:48,990
Thank you.

1534
02:39:49,070 --> 02:39:50,290
I hope you have fun with the karaoke.

1535
02:39:50,610 --> 02:39:52,570
I'll see you guys later.

1536
02:39:53,150 --> 02:39:53,670
Bye bye.
