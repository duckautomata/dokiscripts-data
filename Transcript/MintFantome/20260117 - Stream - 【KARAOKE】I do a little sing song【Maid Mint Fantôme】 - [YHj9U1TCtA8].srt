00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,480

60
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:23,560
Hmm?

61
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,040
I, um, what was it?

62
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,440
I was cooking up some hot water.

63
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:35,320
And I have one of those, like, water dispensers that keeps
it warm, like, all day.

64
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,280
But I just refilled it.

65
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,960
And then I was like, okay, time to get my hot water.

66
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,820

She cooking!

69
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,480
Are you a water microwaver?

70
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,060
Absolutely not.

71
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,060
I have my thing.

72
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,140

73
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,480
my...

74
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,200
dispenser.

75
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,880
My... it's not a kettle.

76
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,140
I microwave everything.

77
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,160
What?

78
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,660
I

79
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,040
just call it a hot water boiler.

80
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,400
It's not a kettle though.

81
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,160
Right?

82
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
Zoji Rushi dispenser is the truth.

83
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,660
You guys, for real though!

84
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,140
With the amount of hot water I drink on a daily basis, like
I need it.

85
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,320
I need it.

86
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,760
It's not a kettle.

87
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,620
It's a hot water dispenser.

88
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,520
And I will die on that hill.

89
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,720
I died on that hill.

90
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm dead.

91
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:55,320
One other thing, another way that I get, I actually like
find a bunch of songs that I want to sing through TikTok

92
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,040
actually.

93
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,640
But my TikTok has been...

94
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:13,440
sad sad tick tocks about dinosaur the ride closing like
literally i the other night i got like five in a row i've i

We'll just do a POV together.

97
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,840
Yeah?

98
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,560
Okay.

99
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,720
Because I only got to go on it one time.

100
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,500
And I was like, maybe I'll do another trip, I thought.

101
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,560
And then prices, plane prices were so expensive.

102
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,460
I said I should not do that.

103
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,400
I've never been on Dinosaur of the Ride.

104
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,100
Is it fun?

105
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,500
Oh, golly.

106
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,420
Is it fun?

107
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,020
Okay, there's a storyline to it.

108
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,480
There's a storyline to it.

109
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,120
So, you are...

110
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,860
Okay, hold on.

111
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,820
There's actually a whole storyline to Dino Land in Disney's
Animal Kingdom.

112
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:26,500
So, the storyline is that there was a small town and they
found, like, a ton of dinosaur fossils, right?

113
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,380
They found a ton of dinosaurs fossils in their small town.

114
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:37,180
And so, a bunch of paleontologists, and everything, they all
started coming in and grew and it was kind of like a gold

115
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,360
rush in a way, but with fossils.

116
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,880
And this is all inside the theme park, okay?

117
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,480
Like this is all the lore of this area of the theme park,
which is kind of rare.

118
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,580
Like not a lot of theme parks do like lore anymore.

119
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,340
Everything also has a stinking IP.

120
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,160
So it's very frustrating.

121
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,240
Like we're losing, we're losing original concepts in theme
parks.

122
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:05,360
Okay, I need to stop because I'm not gonna, This is my
niche, okay?

123
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,640
Anyway, I will get worked up.

124
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,460
I will get worked up.

125
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,120
Okay, but anyway, so all these people come flooding.

126
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,120
And so the, just a small town, so hard.

127
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:29,380
So they try to capitalize off of all these people coming to
see the fossils.

128
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:40,220
So, the theming of Dinoland, right now, a lot of the stuff
was torn down because they're building things for the new

129
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,500
theme that they'll be building.

130
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:55,880
But it used to be very like, the theme was run down, like
tourist trap, tourist attraction, like the most rinkity,

131
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:06,160
rinkity, dinkity, like, side road attraction that you can
think of that was that was like the theming of dinoland and

132
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,260
like there were billboards it kind of told the story through
like you know it was a visual storytelling so you would see

133
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:20,160
like a billboard that would say like turn left here parking
is 50 cents and then they would cross out the 50 cents and

134
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:28,740
like big red paint and it said like parking is now one
dollar things like that you know and so the dinosaur the

135
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,720
ride is This is this institute that came to study the
fossils.

136
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,320
They're like the Dinosaur Institute.

137
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,800
They're like this kind of like their funding is basically
being cut.

138
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,100
Like they're not so in demand anymore.

139
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,980
Like Dino Land is kind of like...

140
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,560
It's actually kind of true to real life because Dino Land is
now leaving.

141
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,200
And it's not popular anymore.

142
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,840
But...

143
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,280
It's kind of like...

144
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:07,700
the lore of Dinoland where people don't go to Dinoland
anymore in the this fictional town in the theme park right

145
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:17,880
and so they're doing their studies at the Dinosaur Institute
and the ride is you are getting your own tour they're

146
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,160
they're gonna send you back to the Crestaceous period and
you're gonna go around and explore but one of the guys there

147
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:36,920
he's just like hey what if we make this like iguanodon that
i want to study and the lady is just like uh no you're not

148
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:45,380
uh you were going on a nice tour he was like i have located
a iguanodon but it's like really close to like the meteors

149
00:16:46,060 --> 00:17:00,300
but you guys will make it and and and they're like they're
like they're like no you're gonna send way before the

150
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,920
meteors, because that's dangerous.

151
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,620
And they're like, he's like, yeah, you're totally right.

152
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:13,200
And then she leaves, and he's like, actually, I totally
hacked the system, and I'm going to send you to go get that

153
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,520
Aguadon.

154
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,100
Okay, get out of here.

155
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,440
And stop making fun of the way I say it, okay?

156
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,100
You guys always make fun of me.

157
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,040

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,630
What?

171
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,610
Why did I...

172
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,730
I can't read.

173
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,250
It doesn't matter.

174
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:24,650
Well, it does matter.

175
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,490
Oh, no.

176
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,630
This is like a jaguar all over again.

177
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,610
Don't say that.

178
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,270
No!

179
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,990
crustaceous.

180
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,930
It does kind of sound like a crustacean.

181
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:36,010
Maybe I was confusing it with crabs.

182
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,730
Maybe that's why I always said it wrong.

183
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,150
That's so funny.

184
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,710
Anyway, you go back in time and you're just like, okay,
we're driving around.

185
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,810
We gotta go find the iguanodon.

186
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,770
You look at this and you're like, nope, not our dino.

187
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,250
Okay, look at this and you're just like, no, maneuver left,
maneuver right.

188
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,770
Oh my god, the meteors are coming down.

189
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,830
Go, go, go.

190
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,910
And then you see like a

191
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,730
Why can't I remember his name right now?

192
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,390
Now I'm all psyched up.

193
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:11,190
You see...

194
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,410
Carnotaurus!

195
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,590
You see the carnotaurus.

196
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,010
Wait, is it?

197
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:33,540
Yeah?

198
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,200
Okay, good.

199
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,240
Yeah, definitely not our dino.

200
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,860
Yeah, he sees it and he's just like...

201
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,420
He's like, go, go, go!

202
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,840
Yeah, you see the carnotaurus.

203
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:48,800
Which I remember, I think it was, there was somebody in the
group that last time I went, and they were like, yeah, you

204
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,740
got to run from the T-Rex.

205
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,580
And I was like, no, there's no T-Rexes on this ride.

206
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,900
It's Carnotaurus, please.

207
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:57,900
Understand.

208
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,780
Please understand.

209
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,800
You are so rock.

210
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,820
But anyway, I can't say shit.

211
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I just said crustaceous.

212
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,940
Like a crab.

213
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:12,800
It's fine.

214
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,100
And...

215
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:23,300
Hey, at least, you know, I'd admit when I'm wrong, and I
will be corrected.

216
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,340
Not a lot of people, some people will double down, okay?

217
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,780
Anyway, so you finally, it's like, it's like 30 seconds to
impact.

218
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,660
Like, it is, time is of the essence.

219
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,060
And finally, in the, like, final 10 seconds, you see him,
the Aguadon, and he is tree-hunting.

220
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:49,260
hugging and you're like grab that guy you literally like you
like wrestle him into the cart and you grab him and then the

221
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:58,360
guy at the end he's like you're not gonna make it they're
not gonna make it and then he's just like they made it and

222
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:07,440
that's the end of the ride it's like so intense it's so
great it's so great and then very it's so cute because

223
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:18,820
afterwards you see like you see like security footage of of
like the area of like the laboratory and everything and and

224
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:31,920
uh you see like the iguana don just like walking around in
the back rooms but it's so cute it's such a good ride it's

225
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,660
so fun and it's like basically the same track almost
identical to Indiana Jones which is what the ride is going

226
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,200
to become But I still...

227
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,220
I still want it to be dinosaurs.

228
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,200
You sold me on it.

229
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,640
Yeah, well, you have less than 20 days to go.

230
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,520
I think it's like...

231
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:00,220
The last day to ride it is February 1st.

232
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,720
So...

233
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,100
What if

234
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,120
Indiana Jones rode dinosaurs?

235
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,400
I wish.

236
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,120
Hashtag not my dinosaur.

237
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,540
Not my dino.

238
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm gonna go ride it in Sunday.

239
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,400
I'm so jealous.

240
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:24,460
Have fun.

241
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:32,120
And what's crazy is, like, technically the dinosaur ride is
based off of an IP, but...

242
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,300
It's technically...

243
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,020
I'm pretty sure I wrote it when I was on Countdown to
Extinction.

244
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,580
I remember that ride, too.

245
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:53,960
I always skip Dinoland because I never realized I was there
I just thought it was a kitty area no what IP is based off

246
00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:02,320
of a movie called dinosaur but like it's not very popular at
all but the thing is is it's only the iguanodon and the

247
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,940
carnitores that are like in that movie like it's based off
of those characters but it's completely like the dinosaur

248
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:18,580
institute everything is is completely separate so man i'm
not sure adding indian 2026 will make it that more popular

249
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:25,480
in the long term dinos are forever i know i'm very torn i
don't know what's up with this like indiana jones resurgence

250
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:33,700
we got the game we had that newer like i say newer because
it came out what last year or the year before we had that

251
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:42,820
movie um but but harrison ford that was like the could do as
Indiana Jones, I think.

252
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,820
We're not getting anymore.

253
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,660
So I don't know.

254
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,920
Oh, it was 2024.

255
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,580
Okay.

256
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,820
Like, I don't think we're getting anymore.

257
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,620
The land was once sponsored by McDonald's, and you can still
see...

258
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,080
Yes!

259
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,600
You can still see pipes that have chemical compounds of
ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise.

260
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,460
You can!

261
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:03,400
You can!

262
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,240
Yeah.

263
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,360
So, literally...

264
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,680
The Isle of Destiny was his MGS4.

265
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,780
You can't do him anymore.

266
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,420
You can't.

267
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,920
No more Indiana Jones.

268
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,560
You can't do that anymore.

269
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,340
Let me take a sipy.

270
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm sorry for getting excited about Dinosaur.

271
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,480
Actually, we should ride it right now.

272
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,020
No, I should sing first.

273
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,520
No, let me get it out of my system.

274
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,640
Let me get it out of my system.

275
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,400
He belongs in a museum.

276
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,020
Yeah.

277
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,440
He belongs in a museum.

278
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,680
Dinosaur, rod, POV.

279
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,160
Let's see.

280
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,900
I think I watched this one.

281
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:00,740
Hold on.

282
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,100
I'm turning off the audio real quick.

283
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,140
Or I did watch this one, but I think what I meant to say is
I remember.

284
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,460
I think it was good.

285
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,480
Okay.

286
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:09,860
Okay.

287
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,160
Yeah.

288
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,860
We can do from...

289
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,780
Oh, we can start from sound.

290
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,720
Oh yeah, okay.

291
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,000
I don't think there's talking or anything, too.

292
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,780
Okay, one second.

293
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,120
One second.

294
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,700
One second.

295
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,040
One second.

296
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,340
One second.

297
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:23,720
One second.

298
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,120
One second.

299
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,800
Okay, it's just a 10-minute video, guys.

300
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,060
No, no.

301
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,480
This is a no-brainer.

302
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,680
Why wouldn't we ride dinosaur the ride?

303
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:39,520
It's fine.

304
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,660
It's fine.

305
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:41,940
It's fine.

306
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,960
It's fine.

307
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,740
It's okay.

308
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,280
I'll even get small.

309
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,720
Okay, hold on.

310
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,500
Move.

311
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Move me.

312
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:57,980
Where am I?

313
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,560
Here.

314
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,540
Okay, let's watch.

315
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,900
Let's watch.

316
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,700
Dinosaur the Rod.

317
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,380
Can you hear it?

318
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,220
Look!

319
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,440

And he's like, wah!

325
00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,720
Which I get to, Rex's, like, but the Carnotaurus is so much
cooler looking, in my opinion.

326
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,280
There's, it's a dark and scary dinosaur place.

327
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,420
What's the cue?

328
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,260

00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:04,460
That's proprietary.

346
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:07,220
It's a breathtaking journey through a prehistoric world.

347
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,420
It's the most spectacular creatures to ever walk the earth.

348
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:20,160
In a moment, you'll be going live to our control center for
a comprehensive safety briefing, and then it's on to the

349
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:25,660
tour that will convince you forever that the future is truly
in the past

350
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:37,160
yeah oh my god this is my guy welcome to our little
transdimensional joyride folks i'm dr seeker your friendly

351
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:43,920
controller and a heck of a paleontologist if i do say so
myself but let's not talk about me let's talk about you and

352
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:51,660
how you can help me this video i wonder how old this is
truly If I can bring you back from the Cretaceous period, he

353
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,200
said it!

354
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,400
I can bring back a live dinosaur with you.

355
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,140
I want a Cretaceous period.

356
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:57,540
Take a look at this guy.

357
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,680
That's the Aquanidata.

358
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,900
See, these are scenes from the movie.

359
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,660
He is the key to understanding these magnificent creatures.

360
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,160
I don't think I've ever seen this movie.

361
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,080
As old as the ride.

362
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,120
Yeah, they've never updated it ever.

363
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,080
Right now, our dino should be about here at the very end of
the Cretaceous period.

364
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,280
That's where you're going to be.

365
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,240
Just kidding, we're not going.

366
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,480
Dr. Marsh.

367
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,900
That is impossible to close to the giant asteroid impact
that destroyed most life forms on Earth.

368
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,580
Yeah, don't worry about it.

369
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,260
It's probably on VHS still.

370
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,220
It's gotta be.

371
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,200
And I'm going to show you that all time rovers have been
securely locked on the Earth's force.

372
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,980
The crustaceous period is far in the future.

373
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,180
That's why the crabs take over the world.

374
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,820
Securely locked.

375
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,320
Access denied.

376
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,480
Access denied.

377
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:45,300
Continued.

378
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,600
Access denied.

379
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,060
We were just talking about seatbelts.

380
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,220
It's so cute the way they do this.

381
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,660
You can get kind of choppy out there, so I'll keep her hands
and arms inside the middle at all times.

382
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,820
Whoa, it's going to get bumpy, guys.

383
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,240
Last photography, I wouldn't.

384
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,540
It alters the homing signal, and that's not good.

385
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,160
Oh, and one more thing.

386
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,680
That was locked coordinates.

387
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,600
We're in.

388
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,000
Now, here's the drill.

389
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,460
You follow the homing signal to the iguanodon.

390
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:16,480
Then, I'll enlarge the transport field, and boom, you're
back with one additional passenger extra large.

391
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,800
Extra large.

392
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:23,180
about that asteroid they'll be able to out of their footing
and breaks the atmosphere trust me what could go wrong we

393
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:32,560
could go wrong sorry hey it's me again remember only you
guys are going on the special only us don't tell anyone

394
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:46,080
don't tell anyone it's kind of messed up don't tell anybody
i don't want to hear the people talking keep going wait okay

395
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,920
oh you can probably see the pipes in

396
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,620
Carcinization mention.

397
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,600
There they are, see those pipes here?

398
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,520
That's your ketchup, a mayo, and your maestro.

399
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,460
Don't tell anyone.

400
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,170
Wow, the Dino Institute welcomes us!

401
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:19,330
The future is in!

402
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,110
It's in!

403
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:35,070
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my
god, oh my god, we're so in!

404
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,130
We're in!

405
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:45,950
And the time rovers, okay, honestly, they look exactly like
the Indiana Jones carts, so that's really easy to like

406
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:46,710
repurpose.

407
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,530
I wish dinosaurs were real.

408
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:53,690
We have dinosaurs.

409
00:31:53,990 --> 00:32:01,830
Apparently birds are starting to, like, show some signs of
evolution in that they're regrowing teeth in their beaks.

410
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,530
Isn't that, like, kind of crazy?

411
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:11,580
Oh.

412
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,640
Time travel commencing in T-minus 10 seconds.

413
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,380
Here we go, guys.

414
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:17,680
Oh, my God.

415
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,480
This is Seeker.

416
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,380
Listen up.

417
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,020
We got to get in, grab the Aquanadon, and get held before
the Astro.

418
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,940
Yeah, baby.

419
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,580
Let's roll!

420
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,380
Oh my gosh, we're going back in time.

421
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:30,960
Whoa!

422
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,140
Whoa!

423
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:33,980
Whoa!

424
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,620
Look at the car.

425
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,820
It's like rolling.

426
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:37,640
Woo!

427
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,600
Okay, now let's go get that dino.

428
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,840
Let's go get that dino!

429
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:44,660
What are you tracking?

430
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,820
That's Dyracosaurus.

431
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,800
Not our dino.

432
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,340
No.

433
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,960
Oh, here comes my favorite one right there.

434
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,960
Here's my favorite animatronic.

435
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,040
It's so gnarly.

436
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:05,220
Hashtag not our dino.

437
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,100
Time to get serious.

438
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,400
Autokilic.

439
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,560
Hang on!

440
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,840
Oh my gosh.

441
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,000
Oh my gosh.

442
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,620
I'm tracking a big dino on the scope.

443
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:19,740
Could be ours.

444
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,040
Nope, that's not our dino.

445
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,200
Definitely not our dino.

446
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:26,940
Go!

447
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:30,980
Go!

448
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,200
Go!

449
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,150
Oh my god.

450
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,370
It's so dark.

451
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,450
I love Dark Brides though.

452
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,510
And identify.

453
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:45,470
Still not our dinosaur.

454
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:45,930
Saurapod.

455
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,950
Still not our dino, but at least this one's a vegetarian.

456
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,350
At least this one's a vegetarian!

457
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,570
The neck flapping I know is so funny.

458
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,290
They look so good still.

459
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,290
Uh-oh.

460
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,630
Uh-oh.

461
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,590
90 seconds, guys.

462
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,490
Interadactal.

463
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,330
Incoming!

464
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,410
Oh my god.

465
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,050
Keep going, keep going!

466
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,630
Keep going!

467
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,390
Computer, what's happening?

468
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,090
Loss of traction.

469
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:23,190
Uh-oh.

470
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,290
We got a maneuver!

471
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,670
Four-wheel drive!

472
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:27,430
Move it!

473
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,100
would be so scary for a kid.

474
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,640
Oh my god.

475
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:41,240
Oh my god.

476
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:45,650
Oh my god.

477
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:46,450
Oh my god.

478
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:51,290
That's where they take your picture.

479
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,530
That's it.

480
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:53,170
Abort.

481
00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:53,970
Abort.

482
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,330
Abort.

483
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:55,870
No.

484
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,330
There he is.

485
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:18,870
They made it.

486
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,330
Did

487
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,700
you guys think we were gonna Crazy.

488
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,760
Wait, I want to see if they have a video.

489
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,760
Oh, yeah, here, here, here.

490
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,400
You see like him wandering around this time.

491
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,720
And they're like looking for him and they're like, oh,
there's like a dinosaur that is just wandering around the

492
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,420
facility.

493
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,140
It's so cute.

494
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,900
I'm all like worked up now.

495
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
good oh my gosh it's so good

496
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,240
it's giving me flashbacks to vid playing Jurassic Park the
arcade except we don't have to pan handle for our quarters

497
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:33,840
every 12 seconds oh the ride is so awesome like this just

499
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:47,300
oh my gosh 5 chance of death for immersion

500
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:59,940
oh man the amount of lore is really impressive right it
scared me so much as a kid that i wanted to go home four

501
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:10,840
states away it was our first ride uh thank you guys for

Thanks for humoring me.

503
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,380
Thank you for humoring.

504
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,240
I'll sing now.

505
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,700
I'll sing now, I promise.

506
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,740
Oh, it's so good.

507
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,980
So good.

508
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,220
All right, Steiner, I understand no Super Bowl, but what if
we buy Dinosaur and keep it for Dinosaur?

509
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:57,180
setsu land so true so true he's so fun can we have a theme
park ride stream someday really would you want that it's

510
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:05,980
great seeing you so happy watching that because it's like
the best ride ever oh it's so fun i'm glad we could ride it

511
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:15,700
together let's see what should i sing today i plan on
singing just kind of whatever um uh i want to sing japanese

512
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:23,020
songs too i was thinking like maybe i was listening to a
bunch of uh what's the word um like you know old school

513
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:33,020
anime openings and stuff like i was listening to like sakura
wars and stuff last night so um it just made me think um

514
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:42,520
maybe like a classic anime opening but i would have to i do
have my switch set up, I would just have to, like, get it.

515
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,800
Get it going.

516
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,380
But basically, the way it works on Joy Sound for the Switch
is that you

517
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,820
have like a time limit.

518
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,840
I know, the Sakura Wars theme is so good.

519
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,400
Could it go today then?

520
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Maybe.

521
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,160
Sing whatever.

522
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,980
Walk the dinosaur.

523
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,760
Have we seen Alien Encounter?

524
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,360
Yes, so good.

525
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,240
So good.

526
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,060
Seen any of the Battlefield Bad Company trailers.

527
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,140
Despite being a military shooter, it's a comedy, and the
trailers make fun of a ton of military games, including

528
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,820
Metal Gear.

529
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,420
Wait, I'll check it out later.

530
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,500
Oh my goddess.

531
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,920
Oh my god, I was thinking that too!

532
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,860
Oh my goddess.

533
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,640
Wait, but like I didn't watch the original, oh my goddess.

534
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,400
I watched like the reboot.

535
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,680
Like it was, it's still old, but the one with Ishida Yoko
did the opening, I remember.

536
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:55,770
What song?

537
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,270
What's like a song that represents me and dinosaur?

538
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:01,570
The ride.

539
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,460
Love a whole live stream just reacting to your favorite
rides.

540
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,440
Also, here's my contribution to the fun of my dinosaur.

541
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,980
Yeah, y'all?

542
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:30,920
Oh, maybe.

543
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,880
I feel like it's almost react content if I'm just like,
okay, now we're going to ride this.

544
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,620
We're going to watch a POV of this ride.

545
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,120
But it would be fun for me.

546
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,600
Standing in Akiva right now, Minto.

547
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,760
This stuff is no game.

548
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,960
What's no game mean?

549
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,080
What do you mean by that?

550
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,480
Andrey goes, thank you so much for the thank you.

551
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,520
Let's see.

552
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,000
Wait,

553
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,320
what am I looking for?

554
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:07,800
One second.

555
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,180
One second.

556
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,190
Oh, I remember.

557
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:28,140
This is like my go-to song when I think of, of when I think
of something that I love.

558
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,100
So, I'm gonna sing it.

559
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,590
Sorry.

560
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,670
One second.

561
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:51,570
Redo?

562
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,420
Why do birds suddenly appear?

563
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:21,680
Every time you are near, just like me, they long to be close
to you.

564
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:29,320
Why do stars fall down from the sky?

565
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,600
Oh my god, they're not going to make it.

566
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:36,080
Every time you walk by, they made it.

567
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:44,420
Just like me, they long to be close to you.

568
00:42:47,320 --> 00:43:00,080
On the day that you were born, the angels got together To
create a dream come true So they sprinkle moon dust in your

569
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:21,980
hair And golden starlight in your eyes of blue That is why
all the girls in town Follow you all around Just like me

570
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:28,140
They longed to be close to you.

571
00:43:52,600 --> 00:44:01,790
On the day that you were born, the angels got together and
decided to create a dream come true.

572
00:44:02,850 --> 00:44:09,230
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair and golden
starlight in your eyes of blue.

573
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:23,910
That is why all the girls in town follow you all around.

574
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:32,090
Just like me, they long to be close to you.

575
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:46,810
Just like me, they long to be close to you.

576
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,730
Love

577
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,800
close to you.

578
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,600
Love

579
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,200
close to you.

580
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:15,060
audio.

581
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:15,480
Ah,

582
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,220
close to you.

583
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:32,760
Ah, close to you.

584
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,580
Ah, close to you.

585
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,320
dinosaur.

586
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,900
I'm gonna miss you so much.

587
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,800
I'm gonna miss you dinosaur.

588
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,440
So good.

589
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,120
So good, man.

590
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,900
Let's see what else we got.

591
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,600
I'm gonna do.

592
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:08,840
Let's see.

593
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,880
Oh, what's this?

594
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:14,040
Hmm.

595
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,760
Hmm.

596
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,500
Sakura Wars was one of my favorites.

597
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,260
I even played all the original games on a special edition
Sakura Wars Dreamcast.

598
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:24,900
I'd use a translation guide.

599
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,480
Oh my gosh, that's crazy.

600
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,480
I'll be honest.

601
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,380
I didn't watch it.

602
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:30,660
I'll be 100% honest.

603
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:33,100
But the opening is so good.

604
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:33,880
Just that.

605
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,960
It's so...

606
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,500
It's so...

607
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:51,900
Oh,

608
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:03,190
it's so good.

609
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,550
Um, let's see.

610
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,090
Hmm.

611
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,790
Okay, actually, now this one's also about dinosaur.

612
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,990
Sorry.

613
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:19,710
I'll stop.

614
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,450
Every night in my dreams, I see you.

615
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:56,730
I feel you, that is how I know you.

616
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,890
Go on.

617
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:00,990
It's my Celine Dion impression.

618
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:16,710
Far across the distance and spaces between us, you have come
to show you.

619
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,750
Go on.

620
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:39,270
Near, far, wherever you are, I believe that the heart does
go on.

621
00:48:41,810 --> 00:49:01,810
Once more, you open the door and you're here in my heart and
my heart will go on and on.

622
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,370
I have to do like this funky thing with my mouth every time
I sing.

623
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:35,290
Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime And never
let go till we're gone Love was when I loved you One true

624
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:46,270
time I hold to in my life will always go on.

625
00:49:49,270 --> 00:50:06,030
Near, far, wherever you are, I believe that the heart does
go on.

626
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:31,010
Once you open the door And you're here in my heart And my
heart will go on and on I can't do it anymore

627
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:39,250
Okay, I'm not serious for now, serious Okay, this is...

628
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,690
Not Celine Dion, this is me too dinosaur.

629
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,810
I am here.

630
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:55,430
There's nothing I fear.

631
00:50:56,110 --> 00:51:04,250
And I know that my heart will go on.

632
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:11,950
We'll stay forever.

633
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:33,160
Oh,

634
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,140
this song's not over.

635
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:52,640
Oh, my gosh.

636
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:01,740
Okay, we're done with dinosaur lamenting.

637
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,440
I think I got it out of my system.

638
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,900
I love this totally normal karaoke stream.

639
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:10,960
Okay, what should I say?

640
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,580
Oh, shoot.

641
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:13,800
I'm sorry.

642
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:14,820
Sorry.

643
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,020
I'm, like, so unserious.

644
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,120
Oh, my gosh.

645
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,000
The Aguadadon could have fit in the time.

646
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:22,460
God.

647
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:26,220
I'll sacrifice myself.

648
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,920
Put me in the Cretaceous period.

649
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,980
I love crabs.

650
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,120
What do you mean?

651
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,660
It's the Cretaceous period.

652
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,340
Oh, no.

653
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,360
I'll go to Japan for the first time in February I want to
ask you for recommendations Everyone says something

Oshima, always, always, always

656
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,640

and that seems so nice i love I love it.

661
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,760
Let me take a sip here.

662
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:57,850
Um, lately there's been this one song I don't watch or
watch.

663
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:08,450
I don't I don't listen to 21 pilots, but like a bunch of fan
edits of this one song by them has been like circulating a

664
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:08,790
lot.

665
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:11,230
It's called drag path ours.

666
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:13,750
I think or that's like one of the names of it.

667
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:23,950
like they haven't released the song yet and so people are
like just like begging for them to to release it and i it's

668
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:31,770
been stuck in my head but like there's no way to sing it
because the song is not released but it's so like i just get

669
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,430
like literally i'll be like brushing my teeth i'll be

670
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:44,710
Oh my gosh.

671
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:47,550
Oh my gosh, Valentine.

672
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:49,290
Thank you so much for the 50 gifted.

673
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:50,190
Thank you.

674
00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:52,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

675
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,210
That song is never getting released for reason.

676
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:57,090
Inexplicable.

677
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,090
I have no idea.

678
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,070
I don't know any lore.

679
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,810
I just know that people are like crying for the song.

680
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,850
And I'm like, I don't know.

681
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:04,830
It's a good song.

682
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:06,050
I don't know what's going on.

683
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,530
Okay, here's my last song to Dinosaur, but it's me moving
on.

684
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:42,750
I heard that you're settled down, that you found a girl and
you're married now.

685
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:49,110
I heard that your dreams came true.

686
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:51,810
Guess she gave you things.

687
00:55:52,110 --> 00:56:03,050
I didn't give to you It's like an iguanodon Hold, friend Why
are you so shy?

688
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,630
Ain't like you to hold back

689
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:20,200
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited But I couldn't
stay away I couldn't fight it I'd hoped you'd see my face

690
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:27,160
And that you'd be reminded that for me It isn't over over
it?

691
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:27,620
Wait a second.

692
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,020
Never mind, I'll find someone like you.

693
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:40,660
I wish nothing but the best for you too.

694
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:47,840
Don't forget me, I beg, I remember you said.

695
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:53,520
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead.

696
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,180
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

697
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:22,840
time flies oh my god the future is in the past yesterday it
was the time of our lives we were born and raised in a

698
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:38,140
summer haze bound by this surprise of our glory I hate to
turn up out of the blue, uninvited, but I couldn't stay

699
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,220
away, I couldn't fight it.

700
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:47,270
I'd hoped you'd see my face, and that for me, you'd be
reminded that for me, it isn't over.

701
00:57:51,920 --> 00:58:12,670
Mind how fine someone like you, I wish nothing but the best
for you to Don't forget me, I bear who you said Sometimes it

702
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:24,990
lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead Nothing
compares, no worries or cares Regrets and mistakes their

703
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:34,810
memories make Who would have known how bittersweet this
would take?

704
00:58:44,980 --> 00:59:01,200
I wish nothing but the best for you too Don't forget me, I
beg, I remember you said Sometimes it lasts in love, but

705
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:18,380
sometimes it hurts instead Never mind, I'll find someone
like you I wish nothing but the best for you best for you

706
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:35,080
too don't forget me I beg I remember you said sometimes it
lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead sometimes it

707
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:40,080
lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

708
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,920
I forgot to turn on the camera angles

709
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:57,290
Yay.

710
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:00,430
Oh, dinosaur.

711
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:03,090
We will never forget you.

712
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,050
Oh, we don't.

713
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,030
Thank you.

714
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:08,050
Thank you now.

715
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:09,050
Thank you so much for that.

716
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:10,360
Go show, bye, thank you.

717
01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:11,890
Goodbye, dinosaur.

718
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,230
I'll find another ride like you.

719
01:00:17,370 --> 01:00:17,870
Maybe.

720
01:00:19,530 --> 01:00:20,410
Probably not.

721
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:23,530
Walk the dinosaur.

722
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:24,730
I don't know that song.

723
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:26,490
I know it, but I don't.

724
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,410
Are there any other words besides get on the floor?

725
01:00:34,170 --> 01:00:35,910
Wait, there's two voices in this?

726
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:36,570
Oh, okay.

727
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,690
Is this the song?

728
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:09,270
I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey's goal to go.

729
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,410
So I was spitting fire.

730
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,570
This time I was blue as ice.

731
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,490
I felt a little tired.

732
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,550
So I washed my amulise.

733
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:19,430
I walked the dinosaur.

734
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:23,760
Ah!

735
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,460
Rock the dinosaur!

736
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:31,600
Open the floor!

737
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,940
Open the door, get on the floor!

738
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:38,860
Everybody rock the dinosaur!

739
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,040
Open the door, get on the floor!

740
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,100
Everybody rock the dinosaur!

741
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:52,700
I met you in a cave!

742
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,110
I said, I'll be your slave!

743
01:01:57,530 --> 01:01:58,870
Follow wherever you go!

744
01:01:58,990 --> 01:01:59,510
What am I singing?

745
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,830
The night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath the
stars.

746
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:07,970
You fell asleep Star stayed awake and watch the passing
cars.

747
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:14,490
Well, you walk the dinosaur and I walk the dinosaur.

748
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:17,530
Open the door.

749
01:02:17,950 --> 01:02:18,390
Let's go.

750
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,550
dinosaur.

751
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:21,630
Open the door.

752
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:22,750
The floor.

753
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:24,610
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

754
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,810
Give out the floor.

755
01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:30,930
On the floor.

756
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,830
Everybody walk the dinosaur.

757
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:48,250
One night I dreamed of New York You and I are roasting blue
pork In the statue of Liberty's torch Am I close to how the

758
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,050
original is?

759
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:55,770
Alphys landed in a rock rock rocket ship Healed a couple
of...

760
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,080
I don't know what the rest of your sentence says.

761
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,140
Oh, Sky, too much big bird!

762
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:04,600
Kill the dinosaur!

763
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,200
No!

764
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:07,220
No!

765
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,520
We're not killing him, please!

766
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,780
Nobody kill the dinosaur!

767
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,940
Nobody kill the dinosaur!

768
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,000
Open the floor, get on the floor!

769
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,120
No, I said floor again.

770
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,300
The floor!

771
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,600

775
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,340
Nobody kill the dinosaur!

776

on the floor nobody killed a dinosaur I don't like this song

777
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,590

hell why would they say that in hindsight not an ideal

779
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:43,650
choice We are killing the dinosaur because the ride is
dying.

780
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:46,870

Wait.

818
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:15,800
If you know Tarzan, you should sing, You'll be in my heart.

819
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,940
Oh, you'll be in my heart.

Oh, you'll be in my heart From this day on Now and
forevermore You'll be in my heart You'll be in my heart

821
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:50,300
That's gonna destroy you No way Maybe this song will destroy
you I

822
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:21,150
bet I hear the Clock tick and think of you Caught up in
circles Confusion is nothing new Flashbacks, warm nights

823
01:13:21,470 --> 01:13:39,410
Almost left behind Suitcases, memories Time after sometimes
You picture me I'm walking too far away ahead you're calling

824
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:57,210
to me i can't hear what you've said then you say go slow i
fall behind the second hand unwise if you're lost you can

825
01:13:57,210 --> 01:14:11,450
look and you will find me time after time if you fall i will
catch you i'll be waiting Time after time If you're lost,

826
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:26,670
you can look and you will find me Time after time If you
fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time My

827
01:14:42,340 --> 01:14:58,140
picture fades and darkness has turned to grey Watching
through windows, you're wandering If I'm okay Secrets stolen

828
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:13,520
From deep inside The drum beats out of time If you're lost,
you can look and you will find me Time after time If you

829
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:19,600
fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time after time

830
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:52,020
You said go slow, I fall behind The second hand unwinds If
you're lost, you can look and you will find me Time after

831
01:15:52,020 --> 01:16:04,680
time If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting Time
after time If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

832
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:07,460
Time after time.

833
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,380
If you fall, I will catch you.

834
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,040
I will be waiting.

835
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:14,780
Time after time.

836
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:51,170
Yeah.

837
01:16:53,090 --> 01:16:53,570
Yippee!

838
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:54,710
Thank you, guys.

839
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:55,610
Thank you, thank you.

840
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,370
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

841
01:17:00,530 --> 01:17:01,590
I love that song.

842
01:17:01,730 --> 01:17:02,910
It's like one of my favorite songs ever.

843
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:04,670
For real.

844
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:08,030
As a time traveler, that's one of my favorite songs.

845
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:14,290
You want a song that always reduces me to sobbing messes as
the world caves in?

846
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,450
Oh, wait, that song is so good!

847
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:22,770
But I only sing the girl, the cover, the girl, the cover
did.

848
01:17:23,010 --> 01:17:24,390
Or, no, but, wait.

849
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:26,390
Sorry, the cover, the girl did.

850
01:17:26,890 --> 01:17:28,630
Not the original, sorry.

851
01:17:35,640 --> 01:17:37,420
The girl, the cover did.

852
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:38,340
No.

853
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:42,260
I was speaking dyslexic.

854
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:43,020
I'm sorry.

855
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,560
Hold on, let me drink for this one.

856
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,200
Okay, the song is so sad.

857
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,220
We'll do happy songs after this one.

858
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:02,160
I feel it are raking.

859
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:04,300
My...

860
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,020
Wait, sorry.

861
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:05,660
Can I restart?

862
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:06,800
One second.

863
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:09,940
I have to remember how it goes in the beginning.

864
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:12,180
It's been a minute.

865
01:18:12,240 --> 01:18:13,420
Hold on, let me hear it real quick.

866
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,280
Can you sing for me?

867
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,760
Sing for me!

868
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:33,700
My feet are aching Your back is pretty tired Okay, I got it,
I got it, I got it, I got it I got it, I got it Okay, okay

869
01:18:40,330 --> 01:18:56,190
My feet are aching And your back is pretty tired And we've
drunk a couple bottles, babe And set our grief aside The

870
01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:09,510
papers say it's Doomsday The button has been pressed We're
gonna nuke each other up, boys Till old Satan stands

871
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:24,130
impressed And here it is Our final night alive to the
ground.

872
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:29,150
Oh boy, it's you.

873
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:41,560
Locks in.

874
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:44,160
Oh boy, it's you.

875
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:58,740
I watch TV with as the world, as the world cares in.

876
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:16,980
your finest suit on I paint my fingernails Oh, we're going
out in style, babe And everything's on sale We creep up on

877
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:33,980
extinction I pull your arms right in I weep and say
goodnight, love While my organs pack it in And here it is,

878
01:20:34,380 --> 01:21:01,600
our final night alive As the earth burns to the ground Oh
boy, it's you That I lie with As the atom of black's in Oh

879
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:18,300
boy, it's you I watch TV with As the world As the world
caves in

880
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:29,860
Chantong So sad!

881
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,100
So sad!

882
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:33,160
So sad!

883
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,960
So sad!

884
01:21:35,180 --> 01:21:37,100
Let's see, what else have we got?

885
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:45,760
What Abba do we have?

886
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:48,560
Happy song time?

887
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,100
No.

888
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:59,180
Wait, I thought of another song that I was thinking of the
other day and I was like, oh I can sing this during karaoke.

889
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,320
Oh my god, this is a throwback though.

890
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:05,280
Is it flambé?

891
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,860
Okay, after this flambé.

892
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:09,880
After this flambé.

893
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,520
If Minto's singing, I'ma crawl out through the fallout.

894
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,860
Shadow Cross, thank you so much for the tag.

895
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:19,180
Thank you.

896
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:19,960
Okay.

897
01:22:24,650 --> 01:22:26,870
Kind of has the same mood as I'd Stop the World.

898
01:22:27,490 --> 01:22:28,790
I'd Stop the World.

899
01:22:28,970 --> 01:22:30,150
I'm out with you.

900
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,750
That one.

901
01:22:34,150 --> 01:22:36,030
Okay, this is another sad song.

902
01:22:36,230 --> 01:22:37,090
Oh my gosh, wait, though.

903
01:22:37,190 --> 01:22:38,270
This is like so...

904
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,090
This is like...

905
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:42,290
When...

906
01:22:42,910 --> 01:22:46,770
Okay, this is like this era of like emo kid, you know?

907
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:51,050
But it's like not emo song, but you...

908
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:52,970
Okay, you'll know when you hear it.

909
01:22:54,110 --> 01:22:55,630
Okay, and then we'll do flambé.

910
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,730
Oh my god, hearing it again is crazy.

911
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:08,830
Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?

912
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:13,450
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight you look so
pretty.

913
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:15,370
Yes you do.

914
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:19,310
Times Square can't shine as bright as you.

915
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:21,790
I swear it's true.

916
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:23,030
Oh, it's so low.

917
01:23:23,750 --> 01:23:27,310
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance?

918
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,590
I'm right there if you get lonely.

919
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,530
Give this song another listen, close your eyes.

920
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:52,330
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise I'm by your side Oh,
it's what you do to me Oh, it's what you do to me Oh, it's

921
01:23:52,330 --> 01:24:06,650
what you do to me Oh, it's what you do to me What you do to
me Hey there, Delilah, I know times are getting hard But

922
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:19,860
just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this
guitar We'll have it good We'll have the lie word is good

923
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:29,860
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say If every
simple song I wrote to you Would take your breath away, I'd

924
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:47,460
write it off Even more in love with me, you'd fall We'd have
it all Oh, it's what you do to me Oh, it's what you do to me

925
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:52,030
Oh, it's what you do to me

926
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:07,330
A thousand miles seems pretty far But they've got planes and
trains and cars I'd walk to you if I had no other way Our

927
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:15,110
friends would all make fun of us But we'll just laugh along
because we know that none of them have felt this way.

928
01:25:16,590 --> 01:25:25,650
Delilah, I can promise you that by the time that we get
through the world will never ever be the same, and you're to

929
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,990
blame.

930
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,250
Hey there, Delilah, you'll be good and don't you miss me.

931
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:39,970
Two more years and you'll be done with school, and I'll be
making history like I do.

932
01:25:41,110 --> 01:25:41,110
We

933
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,960
can do whatever we want

934
01:25:54,460 --> 01:25:56,660
This one's for you

935
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:12,800
Oh, it's what you do to me Oh, it's what you do to me Oh,
it's what you do to me

936
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:49,680
Too low How do you even go?

937
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:53,720
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

938
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:03,760
It's too long!

939
01:27:05,740 --> 01:27:10,620
I love playing my cheese so glad I got to hear you sing one
of their songs you should sing hate I really don't like you.

940
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,760
I really really don't like you it's a fun song.

941
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,680
Wait I think I know that one.

942
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:28,940
Oh whatever wait go away Sakana do you know any Gundam
songs?

943
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:32,660
Go away what are you doing here?

944
01:27:39,640 --> 01:27:41,280
I'm not on Japanese songs.

945
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,460
Actually, how long have I been streaming?

946
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:48,760
Or, oh, well, I talked for a long time, almost an hour about
dinosaur, and then I sang a bunch of songs about dinosaur.

947
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:00,600
I'm not that sick of English songs yet.

948
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,720
What's, like, a new song?

949
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:06,100
Let's see.

950
01:28:12,690 --> 01:28:14,050
Wait, how does this one go again?

951
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:17,630
I don't

952
01:28:28,410 --> 01:28:29,850
know, I don't think I remember it enough.

953
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:30,610
Dang it.

954
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:31,950
I must see.

955
01:28:34,230 --> 01:28:35,110
Chapelle Roan.

956
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:39,930
Did she, wait, didn't she, was there a new song?

957

Oh, or am I thinking of the subway?

959
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:47,990
I could try subway.

960
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:53,430
Fall on angel propane and stalking.

961
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:54,910
I just, I just said.

962
01:28:55,010 --> 01:28:57,030
No anime songs yet.

963
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,370
Oh, Flambe!

964
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:00,590
I wrote it down even.

965
01:29:00,690 --> 01:29:01,550
Wait, what was that song?

966
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:03,250

967
01:29:05,630 --> 01:29:06,990
What's that song called?

968
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,550
What's the Flambe song called?

969
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:16,370
Oh, I'm a bird.

970
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:17,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

971
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:17,870
Okay, wait, hold on.

972
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:19,430
Let me see if I can find his lyrics.

973
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:24,330
Song lyrics.

974
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:27,270
Oh my gosh!

975
01:29:28,330 --> 01:29:28,810
Wait.

976
01:29:29,550 --> 01:29:30,470
Oh, here we go.

977
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,400
He just yaps the whole song.

978
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,680
Oh my god.

979
01:29:43,780 --> 01:29:45,280
Okay, we'll do Chapel Row and after.

980
01:29:50,710 --> 01:29:51,550
What's this song?

981
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:53,090
It's just called Bitch.

982
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:54,210
I'm a bitch.

983
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:56,290
Oh, wait, no.

984
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,850
Wow, there's a lot of songs that contain the word bitch.

985
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:00,910
Wait.

986
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:02,010
What's it?

987
01:30:02,010 --> 01:30:02,810
Who is it by?

988
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:14,680
Oh, Meredith Brooks.

989
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:18,440
Oh, oh, it's the very first one.

990
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,000
Okay, I thought it was called I'm a bitch.

991
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:22,660
Oh, no, this is Subway.

992
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,080
Okay, never mind.

993
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:28,400
Well, it sounds like hip-hop, but it's not.

994
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:30,480
Because then the white guitar comes in.

995
01:30:30,580 --> 01:30:31,520
Oh, oh, yeah.

996
01:30:32,980 --> 01:30:33,380
Yeah.

997
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,570
I hate the world today.

998
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:42,610
You're so good to me.

999
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:45,010
I know but I can't change.

1000
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,090
I can't change!

1001
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:54,470
I tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe I'm an
angel underneath innocent and sweet.

1002
01:30:57,050 --> 01:31:01,570
Yesterday I cried sour and sweet sweet and sour sauce.

1003
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,350
Oh you have no music!

1004
01:31:21,720 --> 01:31:24,280
Oh sounds like hip hop but it's not.

1005
01:31:24,620 --> 01:31:26,540
Oh yeah, the guitar comes in.

1006
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,260
Oh yeah, mmm, mmm.

1007
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:30,560
It's like, right, DMZ?

1008
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:32,120
So what is he yapping about?

1009
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:32,960
Oh my god.

1010
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:35,220
I hate the world today.

1011
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:39,900
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change.

1012
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,260
I can't change!

1013
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:44,900
I tried to tell you, but you look at me like maybe.

1014
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,140
I'm an angel underneath.

1015
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:52,040
Innocent and sweet, like sweet and sour sauce.

1016
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:53,660
Yesterday I cried.

1017
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:59,360
I've been totally to see the softer side So, so, so!

1018
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,160
Alright, back up, sing for me.

1019
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:02,600
I can't understand.

1020
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:04,140
Help you be so confused.

1021
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,620
I don't envy you.

1022
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:08,340
I'm a little bit of everything.

1023
01:32:08,980 --> 01:32:10,600
All rolled into one.

1024
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,980
I'm a bitch.

1025
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,580
My name's Robert, such a bitch whose name is Robert.

1026
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,060
I'm a bitch, yeah, I'm a bitch.

1027
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:20,300
I'm such a fucking bitch.

1028
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:29,600
I have no hopes, have no dreams, And a tiny little peal and
it doesn't even function anyway Because I'm a rectile

1029
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:41,640
dysfunction Time to take a look to me as I am Just a tiny
little bitch of a man Rest assured that when I start to make

1030
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:49,340
you nervous I'm going to extremes Tomorrow I will change and
today What made a thing?

1031
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:49,920

1038
01:33:29,240 --> 01:33:29,480
Ow!

when you suffer I'm your angel undercover I'm enough

1044
01:34:24,310 --> 01:34:24,670
Leave?

1045
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:24,990
What?

1046
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:26,670
Leave the pain medication

1047
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:35,050
to whoever's next.

1048
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:39,820
Am I a superstar?

1049
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:41,920
Yeah, this is my new job, guys.

1050
01:34:43,940 --> 01:34:49,300
You gotta get a new Z-Team, guys, because I'm like, I'm
opening, like, fuck Taylor, Taylor or something.

1051
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:50,980
Oh, my God, this guy is shredded.

1052
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:52,920
Oh, my God, I can't sit down yet.

1053
01:35:09,070 --> 01:35:09,970
Oh, he's still going.

1054
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:10,750
Oh, my God.

1055
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:14,710
I should go to the, what pedal is that?

1056
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:16,450
I should go to the guitar center and figure it out.

1057
01:35:34,570 --> 01:35:43,170
was that everything you guys wanted i literally there was
somebody on reddit that was like i wrote out everything that

1058
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:51,070
flambé did in his song and so i just literally read it out
as much as i could

1059
01:35:59,540 --> 01:36:04,980
yeah thank you my kamiosi for filling my request i think
i'll change my name to robert now i don't know i don't think

1060
01:36:04,980 --> 01:36:07,460
the song is very positive towards robert Robert.

1061
01:36:09,740 --> 01:36:10,600
Thank you, Reddit post.

1062
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,020
Thank you, Reddit post.

1063
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:16,220
Let's do the Chaplorone song.

1064
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:18,500
Then maybe I'll go to Japanese songs for a bit.

1065
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:20,520
But.

1066
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:27,240
I'd say Robert got fairly wrecked.

1067
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:28,260
Yeah, I think so, too.

1068
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:33,220
Okay, she does, like, really high notes at the end of this.

1069
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,920
I don't know if I'll do it.

1070
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,380
It's also been a while since I've heard this song, so.

1071
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:43,690
This is The Subway by Chapel Road.

1072
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:58,780
I saw your green hair, beauty mark next to your mouth.

1073
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:01,020
They're on the subway.

1074
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,600
I nearly had a breakdown.

1075
01:37:05,220 --> 01:37:10,340
A few weeks later, somebody wore your perfume.

1076
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,520
It almost killed me.

1077
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,740
I had to leave the room.

1078
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:18,460
It's just another room.

1079
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:23,940
And it's not over till it's over.

1080
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,860
It's never over.

1081
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:30,480
It's just another day.

1082
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,620
And it's not over till it's over.

1083
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:43,040
And it's never over till I don't look for you on the
staircase.

1084
01:37:45,020 --> 01:37:48,460
Or wish you thought that we were still so much.

1085
01:37:50,000 --> 01:38:06,600
But I'm still counting down all of the days Till you're just
another girl on the subway Made you the villain, evil for

1086
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:18,460
just moving on I see your shadow, I see it even with the
lights off I made a promise, if in four months this feeling

1087
01:38:18,480 --> 01:38:31,940
and ain't gone well fuck this city I'm moving to
Saskatchewan it's just another day and it's not over till

1088
01:38:31,940 --> 01:38:49,900
it's over oh till it's over it's just another day and it's
not over till it's over it's never over Till I can break

1089
01:38:49,900 --> 01:39:05,720
routine during foreplay And trust myself that I won't say
your name But I'm still counting down all of the days Till

1090
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:26,440
you're just another girl on the subway She's got, she's got
away She's got away She's got away And she got, she got away

1091
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:43,840
She got away, she got away She's got, she's got away She's
got away, she's got away

1092
01:39:48,480 --> 01:40:03,660
away she got away she got away she got away she's gone she's
gone away

1093
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:17,840
and she got she got away she got away she got away she got
away

1094
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:35,500
And she got, she got away,

1095
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,200
she's got away, she's got away.

1096
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:50,400
I feel like she held that note way longer in the original
song.

1097
01:40:50,420 --> 01:41:02,820
like the original like the that away part i feel like she
held it like crazy hmm hmm maybe i don't know first time i

your voice, Minto.

1100
01:41:25,810 --> 01:41:26,750
That's why he's the best kamiyoshi.

1101
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:30,650
Blue skies from Ace Combat 4.

1102
01:41:31,590 --> 01:41:33,510
Let me get to Ace Combat 4 first.

1103
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:35,410
And then we'll sing Ace Combat songs.

1104
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:40,990
Unless we do lag.

1105
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:42,850
What's a word?

1106
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:49,330
The 7 one.

1107
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:51,310
Oh my gosh.

1108
01:41:56,190 --> 01:41:58,930

1109
01:42:03,410 --> 01:42:05,270

what is it with chaplain unrequited love songs i think she
like has someone just she just is not over for real

1111
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:28,830
daredevil so stinking good if you ever if you've never
listened to ace combat music, just listen to Daredevil.

1112
01:42:29,130 --> 01:42:30,330
It's so good.

1113
01:42:31,150 --> 01:42:32,610
It's so good.

1114
01:42:33,210 --> 01:42:35,210
She's a professional yearner, for real.

1115
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:39,370
I saw somebody requesting Abba.

1116
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:43,190
Which one, which Abba should we do?

1117
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:51,550
The Subway is one of my favorite songs in karaoke that I
listen to, I loop all the time.

1118
01:42:51,650 --> 01:42:53,010
I'm glad you managed the high notes this time.

1119
01:42:53,410 --> 01:42:55,150
Yeah, oh gosh, that's embarrassing though.

1120
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:57,770
Dance it queen!

1121
01:42:57,970 --> 01:42:58,890
I love dance it queen.

1122
01:43:02,350 --> 01:43:06,770
Okay, one more sad song and then we'll end it on a happy
song and then we'll go to Japanese songs.

1123
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:09,570
Song.

1124
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:11,430
Oh, it starts immediately.

1125
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:14,810
School bag in hand.

1126
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:19,530
She leaves home in the early morning.

1127
01:43:20,790 --> 01:43:25,350
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile.

1128
01:43:27,010 --> 01:43:44,570
I watch her go with the surge of that well-known sadness and
I have to sit down for a while the feeling that I'm losing

1129
01:43:44,570 --> 01:44:05,050
her forever and without really entering her world I'm Glad
whenever I can share her laughter That funny little girl

1130
01:44:05,670 --> 01:44:17,710
Slipping through my fingers all the time I try to capture
every minute The feeling in it Slipping through my fingers

1131
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:30,550
all the time Do I really see what's in her mind Each time I
think I'm close to knowing She keeps on growing, slipping

1132
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:34,330
through my fingers all the time.

1133
01:44:36,690 --> 01:44:43,090
Sleep in her eyes, her and me at the breakfast table.

1134
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:49,830
Breaking bad, barely awake, I let precious time go by.

1135
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:56,310
Then when she's gone, there's that awe.

1136
01:44:56,330 --> 01:45:14,970
melancholy feeling and a sense of guilt I can't deny what
happened to the wonderful adventures the places I had

1137
01:45:14,970 --> 01:45:32,230
planned for us to go well some of that we did but the most
we did it I just don't know Slipping through my fingers all

1138
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:45,170
the time I try to capture every minute The feeling in it
Slipping through my fingers all the time Do I really see

1139
01:45:45,170 --> 01:45:46,850
what's in her mind?

1140
01:45:47,130 --> 01:46:01,330
Each time I think I'm close to knowing She keeps on growing
Slipping through my fingers Sometimes I wish that I could

1141
01:46:01,330 --> 01:46:13,110
freeze the picture And save it from the funny trace of time
Slipping through my finger

1142
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:54,400
School back in hand She leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye

1143
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:00,080
minded smile

1144
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:05,750
Come on

1145
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,560
You can dance

1146
01:47:32,600 --> 01:47:41,880
Oh, see that girl Watch that scene Dig in the dancing queen

1147
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:49,600
Friday night and the lights are lit

1148
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:15,940
The night is young and the music's high Everything

1149

is fine You're in the loop for a day And when you get the
chance You are the dancing queen Young and sweet forever 19

1151
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:01,060
Ooh, see that girl.

Watch that scene.

1153
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:05,800
Take in the dancing queen.

1154
01:49:18,020 --> 01:49:21,780
You're a teaser, you turn him on.

1155
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:33,640
You're in the mood for a dance.

1156
01:49:36,140 --> 01:49:43,480
And when you get the chance, you are the dancing queen.

1157
01:49:44,980 --> 01:50:06,200
And sweet forever 19 Dancing clean Feel the beat from the
tambourine Oh yeah You can dance You can drive Oh,

Let me grab my switch.

1160
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:07,930
Joy sound.

1161
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:10,410
Oh, uh.

1162
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:13,270
Let me update my switch real quick.

1163
01:51:13,950 --> 01:51:14,830
I have a system update.

1164
01:51:17,330 --> 01:51:18,410
Please restart.

1165
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:20,770
Oh, well, I do this.

1166
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:22,910
I'm going to go grab some water real quick.

1167
01:51:25,490 --> 01:51:27,290
I'll be right super back.

1168
01:51:28,110 --> 01:51:30,450
Actually, I'm going to grab some water and go to the little
ghosty's room.

1169
01:51:31,730 --> 01:51:32,210
I'll be right back.

1170
01:54:13,970 --> 01:54:15,130
Welcome back, thank you!

1171
01:54:15,250 --> 01:54:16,170
Ta-da-da-ima!

1172
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:18,770
So I should be saying to you, though.

1173
01:54:19,390 --> 01:54:19,630
Alright.

1174
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:20,730
Karaoke.

1175
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:22,070
Hasimere.

1176
01:54:30,010 --> 01:54:30,490
Hmm.

1177
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:36,650
Now, here's the difficult part.

1178
01:54:36,750 --> 01:54:39,890
It's like, what do I start with with a...

1179
01:54:39,910 --> 01:54:40,790
Japanese karaoke.

1180
01:54:41,030 --> 01:54:42,530
Oh my gosh, it's been so long since I've done it.

1181
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,040
I don't know Gundam songs.

1182
01:54:49,160 --> 01:54:50,620
I don't know why we have this impression.

1183
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,240
Actually, I know one Gundam song.

1184
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,560
I know one Gundam song.

1185
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:03,880
I know a couple, but I know them enough to sing them.

1186
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:05,540
But I know one that I can sing.

1187
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:13,390
Mix.

1188
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:15,410
Oh my gosh, it's been so long since I've heard two mix.

1189
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:19,790
a Tumik song from Conan.

1190
01:55:20,990 --> 01:55:22,190
I could sing Detective Conan.

1191
01:55:25,190 --> 01:55:27,870
Oh my gosh, wait, it's been so long since I've sung
Detective Conan.

1192
01:55:28,910 --> 01:55:30,570
Stay with me, Miku, Matsubara.

1193
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:32,930
Yeah, I'll write some of these down that I feel like
singing.

1194
01:55:33,390 --> 01:55:34,750
Stay with me.

1195
01:55:34,890 --> 01:55:35,470
That one's easy.

1196
01:55:35,910 --> 01:55:37,270
Now well, they get some whisper though.

1197
01:55:37,690 --> 01:55:39,010
Thank you to thank you.

1198
01:55:39,330 --> 01:55:39,690

Oh my gosh.

Just communication.

1202
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:05,060
I'm trying to remember what's from Conan.

1203
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:10,920
I mean, they've had a couple Conan songs, but there's like
one specifically that I remember.

1204
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:19,140
And they have two on here.

1205
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:20,380
Oh, wait, they have more than two.

1206
01:56:20,520 --> 01:56:20,860
Just kidding.

1207
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:21,480
I'm a liar.

1208
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:30,600
Oh my god, Toomix did the song for the X-Files!

1209
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,000

01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:53,210
Yes.

01:58:57,300 --> 01:58:57,780
Yippee!

1241
01:58:59,280 --> 01:59:00,760
Soft on the modoloo.

1242
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:07,100
Kaisi.

1243
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:15,200
Switch sounds.

1244
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:17,920
Hello?

1245
01:59:18,140 --> 01:59:18,860
Is it gonna go?

1246
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:19,400
There we go.

1247
01:59:19,580 --> 01:59:19,980
Oh my gosh.

1248
01:59:20,980 --> 01:59:21,460
Ah!

1249
01:59:30,190 --> 01:59:33,870
Wait, do you guys want to see the screen or do you not care?

1250
01:59:57,980 --> 01:59:58,580
Oh my god.

1251
02:00:00,860 --> 02:00:02,180
Oh, I haven't heard this song!

1252
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,540
And like, maybe...

1253
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:06,080
Maybe like...

1254
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,480
Oh my god, I don't even know how many years.

1255
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:08,100
Like 15.

1256
02:00:12,220 --> 02:00:13,180
Break my lives,

1257
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:33,980
Oh no, there's like the, what's it called, the delay.

1258
02:00:35,240 --> 02:00:36,240
So I can't follow it.

1259
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:37,980
I have to read the words for real.

1260
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:43,100
So to give a little bit lore about this song, this is a
Tumik song.

1261
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:51,920
The voice actress for Conan is the singer of Tumik's, but
Conan, the character, is canonically tone deaf.

1262
02:01:52,680 --> 02:02:01,120
So there's like a funny episode where he has, everybody is
like, oh my gosh, Conan, you sound so much like this, like

1263
02:02:01,120 --> 02:02:02,580
this singer.

1264
02:02:02,860 --> 02:02:06,640
You have to cover for her because she can't do the concert.

1265
02:02:07,100 --> 02:02:08,120
And he's like, what the hell?

1266
02:02:08,700 --> 02:02:12,020
But he is tone deaf, so he sings the song, but it's her.

1267
02:02:12,540 --> 02:02:15,320
Technically singing the song, but she has to pretend to be
tone deaf.

1268
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:16,780
It's so funny.

1269
02:02:23,500 --> 02:02:25,280
Breakdown lore drop,

1270
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:38,630
yeah.

1271
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:43,130
I guess maybe now would have been the better do it time to
do it because there's no singing but yeah

1272
02:02:47,730 --> 02:02:54,810
Oh my gosh, I love telling people about Conan lore because
it's just so wild If you ever want me to tell you about

1273
02:02:54,810 --> 02:02:55,590
Conan stuff.

1274
02:02:55,930 --> 02:02:56,650
I'm your ghost

1275
02:03:00,650 --> 02:03:04,470
Ravak thanks for the gift oh, oh I'm raiders.

1276
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:05,330
Oh, thank you.

1277
02:03:05,350 --> 02:03:06,730
I'm so sorry to see hello

1278
02:03:48,670 --> 02:03:53,290
I love that

1279
02:03:59,270 --> 02:04:02,030
the only part I know this song I remember is the chorus

1280
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:40,440
yeah that was a break by two mix you found the Conan clip
that's so funny wait I wanted to if I search Conan let's see

1281
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:52,360

1282
02:04:56,060 --> 02:04:57,640
Oh, I love this song too!

1283
02:04:58,240 --> 02:04:59,140
Wait, I want to sing this one.

1284
02:05:01,420 --> 02:05:03,860
This one I've sung in karaoke before though, sorry.

1285
02:05:05,060 --> 02:05:05,940
Fiction by Sumigo.

1286
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:07,820
Oh my gosh, I haven't heard that song in so long.

1287
02:05:09,220 --> 02:05:10,500
This is not the one that goes like...

1288
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:14,220
That one?

1289
02:05:27,900 --> 02:05:30,640
Oh no, I forgot the music videos are so funny.

1290
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,900
Oh no, okay, I try not to be distracting.

1291
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:46,220
Furi-sou, two of you, you're overlapped In the cold wind,
the cold of the wind, you're overlapped, The freshness of

1292
02:05:46,220 --> 02:05:49,560
the warmth, now, stop.

1293
02:05:51,020 --> 02:05:52,000
Time to stop.

1294
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,140
Time to stop.

1295
02:05:54,520 --> 02:06:01,320
Yes, always the day, I'm going to forget your words.

1296
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:23,300
I've been thinking about

1297
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:37,540
I've been thinking about you.

1298
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:42,380
I've been thinking about you.

1299
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:50,540
Technically, this is a fall song or whatever.

1300
02:06:56,040 --> 02:06:57,040
.

1301
02:06:58,620 --> 02:06:59,620
.

1302
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:06,240
.

1303
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:08,500
over the years.

1304
02:07:08,500 --> 02:07:52,380
Stalk, do you remember say, it's time to see when I want to
when I want to see when I want to see soon it turns out I've

1305
02:07:52,380 --> 02:08:01,460
been thinking about you, I've been thinking about you I'm
always looking for you.

1306
02:08:01,940 --> 02:08:07,340
I am always looking for you, even more than what I'm
feeling.

1307
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:23,500
Any time I'm looking for you, when it's now, I'm so nice and
I can be able to see that I'm going to have.

1308
02:08:23,980 --> 02:08:25,380
I'm thinking,

1309
02:08:39,780 --> 02:08:45,080
I've been thinking about you, I've been thinking about you.

1310
02:08:52,020 --> 02:08:57,700
Why are there no lyrics for that bar?

1311
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:58,360
What are you?

1312
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:00,520
They

1313
02:09:07,550 --> 02:09:08,550
left them off the screen.

1314
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:11,410
Okay, so I've been really good about holding it in.

1315
02:09:12,650 --> 02:09:16,050
The music video for this one is a girl like joining a cult
maybe.

1316
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:23,680
I think she joined a cult.

1317
02:09:24,920 --> 02:09:26,100
I think so.

1318
02:09:27,880 --> 02:09:30,880
I think she joined a cult.

1319
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:33,260
She had, like, a cape on.

1320
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:34,760
What was going on?

1321
02:09:39,290 --> 02:09:40,870
What was going on?

1322
02:09:44,730 --> 02:09:47,530
If you know about the barbarian, just ask Minto.

1323
02:09:47,910 --> 02:09:48,550
Wait, Ron Conan.

1324
02:09:48,750 --> 02:09:49,350
Ron Conan.

1325
02:09:49,710 --> 02:09:51,130
If you want to know about the talk host show.

1326
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:53,250
Well, talk show host.

1327
02:09:53,310 --> 02:09:53,810
Oh, gosh.

1328
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:55,350
Why am I so dyslexic?

1329
02:09:58,210 --> 02:09:59,870
Why am I so dyslexic?

1330
02:10:10,650 --> 02:10:11,450
Taco's joke.

1331
02:10:12,930 --> 02:10:13,130
Ah!

1332
02:10:14,450 --> 02:10:14,850
Why?

1333
02:10:15,670 --> 02:10:18,270
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just going through the popular songs.

1334
02:10:18,370 --> 02:10:19,590
Wait, I want to sing this song.

1335
02:10:22,410 --> 02:10:23,530
The song is so hard.

1336
02:10:23,610 --> 02:10:26,050
I'm not good at singing it, but I like singing because it's
fun.

1337
02:10:28,210 --> 02:10:29,510
if I mess it up.

1338
02:10:29,750 --> 02:10:30,310
Sorry, sorry.

1339
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:31,490
Sorry in advance.

1340
02:10:33,330 --> 02:10:34,690
It's such a good song though.

1341
02:10:34,890 --> 02:10:35,650
Everybody agrees.

1342
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:37,010
Everybody agrees.

1343
02:10:37,170 --> 02:10:37,790
10 out of 10.

1344
02:10:39,650 --> 02:10:40,360
You guys know this one.

1345
02:11:19,270 --> 02:11:21,690
I ran out of breath, sorry?

1346
02:11:35,980 --> 02:11:37,360
Turn that off!

1347
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:44,300
Oh!

1348
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:44,520
Turn that off!

1349
02:11:44,520 --> 02:11:56,420
No more, no more, no more, no more No more, no more music
You're the one that you'll cause magic No more, you'll get

1350
02:11:56,420 --> 02:12:01,900
your heart I'd say it's forever, it's not your heart, you're
It's your heart What?

1351
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:04,640
This song will tell you.

1352
02:12:05,860 --> 02:12:08,060
Do you wanna play real game?

1353
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:11,060
Giri giri, tina wadari-like a sentence.

1354
02:12:11,660 --> 02:12:15,320
I don't want to be able to get back to my dream in the
dream.

1355
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:18,240
I wanna be free.

1356
02:12:18,980 --> 02:12:20,880
I can see the new world.

1357
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:23,980
I can see the new world.

1358
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:26,920
I can see the new world.

1359
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:30,380
The new world is the new world.

1360
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:46,480
Okay,

1361
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:52,440
now the guy is joining a cult.

1362
02:12:52,800 --> 02:12:55,360
He's in a robe too in the forest and he's burning music.

1363
02:13:11,780 --> 02:13:14,720
There are, there, I don't know what's going to be like that.

1364
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,960
Real or colorful, you can't do that.

1365
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:20,720
Music, now it's starting, rising.

1366
02:13:22,860 --> 02:13:24,060
I'm going to look at you.

1367
02:13:25,600 --> 02:13:29,380
I'm going to show you, I'm going to show you.

1368
02:13:29,460 --> 02:13:30,120
Oh my gosh, I can't do that.

1369
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,200
I can't do that.

1370
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:35,820
Do you want to play a real game?

1371
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:39,740
Giri-giri, tina-wattari-minty-minty-nai-minty-nai I'm skip.

1372
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:40,380
I don't want you.

1373
02:13:40,420 --> 02:13:40,880
I'm going to go back.

1374
02:13:41,340 --> 02:13:44,280
Let this dream in the new world.

1375
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:46,060
I want to be free.

1376
02:13:46,700 --> 02:13:47,220
I can't believe it.

1377
02:13:47,540 --> 02:13:52,380
Find the life world, figure.

1378
02:13:52,380 --> 02:13:54,620
I can't believe it.

1379
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:59,660
I believe the future will change it.

1380
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:01,200
Dream the world كل me.

1381
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:04,520
I'm going to change it.

1382
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:51,900
funny music video he's there's like feathers and then he
cuts a put a cut in his hand and There's black smoke coming

1383
02:14:51,900 --> 02:14:52,500
out of it.

1384
02:14:52,840 --> 02:14:54,200
I can't make this up.

1385
02:14:57,140 --> 02:14:58,480
I can't make it up.

1386
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:01,140
I can't back it up.

1387
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:05,300
I don't know what I was watching.

1388
02:15:05,440 --> 02:15:06,660
It was really distracting me.

1389
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:10,180
Oh my gosh.

1390
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:11,620
That's fine.

1391
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:14,860
Crazy karaoke lore.

1392
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:16,820
Crazy.

1393
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,560
Morgan's Ghost.

1394
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:20,040
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

1395
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:20,800
Thank you.

1396
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:27,360
I wish I could sing more fruit zipper songs.

1397
02:15:27,480 --> 02:15:29,900
They're so fun, but they're so fast.

1398
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:30,680
I love One Piece.

1399
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:31,260
I love Ado.

1400
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:32,000
I love Mito.

1401
02:15:34,520 --> 02:15:36,540
Seeing New Genesis Live is a magical experience.

1402
02:15:36,640 --> 02:15:37,520
Oh my God, I would kill.

1403
02:15:38,340 --> 02:15:39,780
I want to see Ado Live.

1404
02:15:40,120 --> 02:15:40,700
It would be crazy.

1405
02:15:43,460 --> 02:15:46,000
I missed her when she was touring, so I'm like, no.

1406
02:15:48,460 --> 02:15:48,820
Yeah.

1407
02:15:49,140 --> 02:15:52,440
Do you think these silly karaoke videos have hidden lore,
like, just dance?

1408
02:15:52,660 --> 02:15:53,880
Just Dance has lore?

1409
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:57,260
The only Rolling Star.

1410
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:00,660
I think I tried singing that one before, and I was like...

1411
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:05,160
I think I don't know this song as much as I thought.

1412
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,900
You would think it's so easy.

1413
02:16:18,220 --> 02:16:21,880
I'm going to...

1414
02:16:22,660 --> 02:16:24,780
through some of the popular songs.

1415
02:16:27,940 --> 02:16:28,100
Naruto.

1416
02:16:37,310 --> 02:16:38,050
Let's see.

1417
02:16:39,390 --> 02:16:42,070
Oh, I'm trying to find songs that like.

1418
02:16:44,250 --> 02:16:44,950
That like.

1419
02:16:46,370 --> 02:16:46,830
What's the word?

1420
02:16:48,010 --> 02:16:49,570
You know the end song for Inu Yashu.

1421
02:16:50,010 --> 02:16:50,810
Which one?

1422
02:16:51,470 --> 02:16:52,250
I'm trying to find songs.

1423
02:16:52,350 --> 02:17:02,470
So because I have to pay for the service and i only get
three hours i like to choose songs that i don't get to sing

1424
02:17:02,470 --> 02:17:09,150
often you know like there's a bunch of songs that i like i
could choose that have like free karaoke on youtube you know

1425
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:18,110
what i mean this thing new genesis was amazing but i guess
also Shinji Dai is also like it's also pretty easy to find

1426
02:17:18,110 --> 02:17:26,950
on youtube but whatever i love the sapikara for like ice
cream Sabikara means like just from the chorus.

1427
02:17:27,330 --> 02:17:32,070
So it's only the chorus of Ah, subkornim, subkornim,
subkornim, subkornim.

1428
02:17:32,070 --> 02:17:34,070
That's a good one.

1429
02:17:34,670 --> 02:17:35,070
Departure.

1430
02:17:35,190 --> 02:17:36,690
Oh my gosh, I wish I knew the song better.

1431
02:17:40,010 --> 02:17:40,810
So good.

1432
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,210
Oh, gosh.

1433
02:17:45,970 --> 02:17:47,850
Why is Curious George on here?

1434
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,610
Sounds like she needs more yen e-shop.

1435
02:17:54,710 --> 02:17:55,750
No, I don't.

1436
02:17:56,650 --> 02:18:02,310
I'm just explaining why sometimes you guys say give me songs
and I don't pick them.

1437
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:04,890
Like God knows or Kimi no Shiranai Monogatari.

1438
02:18:06,170 --> 02:18:11,650
Those ones are easy to find instrumentals who are on YouTube
and they're free and this one's not free.

1439
02:18:14,610 --> 02:18:18,650
But I guess most of the popular songs would have like...

1440
02:18:20,050 --> 02:18:20,910
What's it called?

1441
02:18:21,730 --> 02:18:23,890
Would have karaoke's on YouTube.

1442
02:18:24,230 --> 02:18:24,550
Maybe.

1443
02:18:28,430 --> 02:18:29,630
But sometimes...

1444
02:18:29,630 --> 02:18:31,330
I don't know.

1445
02:18:33,370 --> 02:18:34,590
Yeah, let me look up Kotoko.

1446
02:18:35,350 --> 02:18:36,190
Let's do that.

1447
02:18:36,330 --> 02:18:36,850
You're so right.

1448
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:39,250
Resublimity.

1449
02:18:42,920 --> 02:18:43,760
Wait, keywords.

1450
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:44,800
There we go.

1451
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:45,540
Kotoko.

1452
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:46,300
Kotoko.

1453
02:18:48,980 --> 02:18:51,180
K-O-T.

1454
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,520
I wonder if there's any out here.

1455
02:18:53,920 --> 02:18:54,680
Let's see what's on here.

1456
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:55,340
Kotoko.

1457
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:05,540
She was like my Like, favorite singer for so long.

1458
02:19:05,780 --> 02:19:07,340
I love her voice so much.

1459
02:19:11,200 --> 02:19:12,580
Oh, no, I'm getting...

1460
02:19:12,580 --> 02:19:12,820
Okay.

1461
02:19:13,580 --> 02:19:16,680
Oh, there's like an Onigai teacher, shooting star.

1462
02:19:17,880 --> 02:19:19,400
Well, there is resublimity on here.

1463
02:19:20,220 --> 02:19:21,620
Oh, wait, there's actually so many on here.

1464
02:19:22,620 --> 02:19:22,940
Oh, my God.

1465
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:24,260
But there's also like a mix...

1466
02:19:24,260 --> 02:19:27,000
There's like this artist named Toko Toko.

1467
02:19:27,520 --> 02:19:29,320
I guess he's like a Vocaloid producer.

1468
02:19:31,800 --> 02:19:32,520
And he...

1469
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:34,320
There's a bunch of songs featuring Goomi on him.

1470
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:36,560
There you are!

1471
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,740
Oh, I can see if it's on here.

1472
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,860
Oh, I can see if it's on here.

1473
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:44,680
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1474
02:19:45,680 --> 02:19:46,400
Shurling star.

1475
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:48,740
The song is so stinking good.

1476
02:19:48,880 --> 02:19:51,440
I've sung this one in karaoke, though, but it's still good.

1477
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:54,780
The song is so good.

1478
02:19:54,920 --> 02:19:55,300
Oh, my God.

1479
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:55,960
The song is so good.

1480
02:20:05,310 --> 02:20:06,030
The intro...

1481
02:20:06,030 --> 02:20:06,110
The intro...

1482
02:20:06,130 --> 02:20:11,130
Peak, iconic, everything about it, so good.

1483
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:30,840
.

1484
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:31,120
.

1485
02:20:31,120 --> 02:20:31,220
.

1486
02:20:31,740 --> 02:20:32,060
.

1487
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:32,220
.

1488
02:20:32,220 --> 02:20:32,360
.

1489
02:20:34,420 --> 02:20:35,020
.

1490
02:20:35,020 --> 02:20:35,160
.

1491
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:35,580
.

1492
02:20:35,580 --> 02:20:35,660
.

1493
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:35,680
.

1494
02:20:38,260 --> 02:20:38,860
.

1495
02:20:43,630 --> 02:20:44,230
.

1496
02:20:44,230 --> 02:20:44,530
.

1497
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:44,630
.

1498
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,450
.

1499
02:20:54,690 --> 02:21:02,810
Just by the way you feel stronger, it's a feeling of regret.

1500
02:21:04,430 --> 02:21:22,650
One more time, one more time, don't let me know about you in
a big, one of you, one of you, one of you, when you're at a

1501
02:21:22,650 --> 02:21:42,740
time I'm just making up words at this point, sorry, I'll
lock in, I'll lock in.

1502
02:21:54,320 --> 02:21:55,760
I'll lock in.

1503
02:22:02,300 --> 02:22:21,600
Let us go together to be together I'm going to use the glass
in a glass box And I'll always be able to pray for you in

1504
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:30,000
the night And I love you with your smile And I'm so excited
to see how it will be.

1505
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:36,960
When it comes to you, I'll remember you.

1506
02:22:39,860 --> 02:22:40,700
I'll remember you.

1507
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:48,200
In a huge universe, I found two of you and I found a happy
place to find you.

1508
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:54,880
And here are the stars and the stars and the two of you.

1509
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:58,940
The night of the wind and the you and the

1510
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:15,460
The music video is so stinking cute, it's like about a
magical girl and a psychic girl who both like the same guy

1511
02:23:15,460 --> 02:23:18,580
and they're like trying to make him win at soccer.

1512
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:30,770
Show you the video?

1513
02:23:30,970 --> 02:23:31,090
Okay.

1514
02:23:42,030 --> 02:23:42,850
I'll put it in the corner.

1515
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:20,660
You see why I keep getting distracted?

1516
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:46,100
She's got hearts in her eyes, just like I do.

1517
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:54,240
Oh my God, is he okay?

1518
02:24:56,940 --> 02:24:57,660
What's happening?

1519
02:24:58,140 --> 02:24:59,860
Use your magic, save him!

1520
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:01,020
Oh my god!

1521
02:25:01,740 --> 02:25:01,860
Oh

1522
02:25:05,440 --> 02:25:08,180
my god, don't end it on a cliffhanger, please.

1523
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:20,860
That's not what I expected at all.

1524
02:25:21,820 --> 02:25:35,100
Why did I thought she would- Oh my god, he's not gonna- Oh
my god, he's not gonna make it!

1525
02:25:42,520 --> 02:25:51,020
She is- Oh my god, that's gonna take forever for her to
build the bridge.

1526
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:54,520
You have magical powers!

1527
02:25:56,700 --> 02:25:58,620
And you turn it to...

1528
02:26:00,900 --> 02:26:02,540
Oh, it's too good!

1529
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:04,440
Holy cow!

1530
02:26:04,700 --> 02:26:05,460
It's so funny.

1531
02:26:06,920 --> 02:26:09,460
Okay, I'm really glad I showed you guys that one.

1532
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:11,820
Or else I would have just been laughing to myself.

1533
02:26:14,360 --> 02:26:14,760
Oh!

1534
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:17,000
There we go.

1535
02:26:17,640 --> 02:26:18,600
Oh my god.

1536
02:26:20,900 --> 02:26:22,740
How does resublimity go again?

1537
02:26:25,860 --> 02:26:32,480
it for some reason my brain keeps thinking of separation
because that's one of my favorite kotoko songs and that's my

1538
02:26:32,480 --> 02:26:39,940
favorite song from kanazuki no mika he'll return in avengers
dude oh sad oh

1539
02:26:53,780 --> 02:27:05,090
wait isn't the song like really fast wait yeah this song is
really fast wait i think i'm not gonna be able to do it wait

1540
02:27:05,090 --> 02:27:07,690
hold on

1541
02:27:21,620 --> 02:27:35,140
The existence is certainly here and here I'm waiting for the
tears and tears I won't let you know the moment I can't

1542
02:27:35,140 --> 02:27:40,220
hear, can't hear, can't hear I can't see, I can't see, just
My heart goes away

1543
02:27:46,460 --> 02:27:54,000
My voice, my voice, my voice, my voice My voice doesn't come
to me

1544
02:29:17,530 --> 02:29:19,230
This song is hard.

1545
02:29:24,130 --> 02:29:29,750
This song almost makes the instrumental sound like, or this
instrumental almost makes the sound like the song

1546
02:29:29,750 --> 02:29:30,830
unrecognizable.

1547
02:30:49,300 --> 02:30:53,220
I'm so sorry I got the timing all wrong on this song, holy
cow.

1548
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:17,980
hard hold on though i saw like a way that you can search
things in this it's kind of fun like look at this so if you

1549
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:28,400
go so if i go to here and if i go to my history and if i go
to here and if i go to like the search we could search from

1550
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:33,660
the same same release year which it worked

1551
02:31:43,940 --> 02:31:46,700
What else I released in 2000?

1552
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:47,280
What was it?

1553
02:31:48,260 --> 02:31:48,680
Oh no!

1554
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:49,560
Oh my gosh, no!

1555
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:55,680
Oh my gosh, it's almost time to sing that song, though.

1556
02:31:58,500 --> 02:32:00,660
These are all songs that were released in 2004.

1557
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:03,160
Go!

1558
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:08,640
Natsukaji, Natsukaji!

1559
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:12,920
Beauty honey!

1560
02:32:20,080 --> 02:32:21,720
Oh my god, ready, steady, go!

1561
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:24,100
Ready, steady, ready,

1562
02:32:27,340 --> 02:32:27,340
steady!

1563
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:32,620
Ready, steady, ready, ready, ready, ready, ready!

1564
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:36,680
I wish we could try it, we could try it.

1565
02:32:36,920 --> 02:32:39,820
I'm not gonna sing it well, but we'll try it.

1566
02:32:42,480 --> 02:32:43,020
Gakumash!

1567
02:32:43,140 --> 02:32:43,880
No, I'm sorry.

1568
02:32:45,500 --> 02:32:46,580
No Gakumash.

1569
02:32:47,740 --> 02:32:50,840
Yeah, 2004 was a great year for Annie's song, it's so true.

1570
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:03,580
Ready, steady, can't hold me back.

1571
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:06,760
Ready, steady, give me good luck.

1572
02:33:08,260 --> 02:33:10,280
Ready, steady, can't give her a hug back.

1573
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:13,340
Let's get started, ready, steady, go.

1574
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:38,050
Before it goes out to the place where it's hard to see at
least a few enemies.

1575
02:33:38,650 --> 02:33:41,110
I won't be looking at my end.

1576
02:33:41,270 --> 02:33:45,390
Ate-to-near-narr-nay, cheese, I can't get it back.

1577
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:49,030
It's all over the truth.

1578
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:59,810
In my hands on my hands, I'm so so so, so M-tool, and I'm
so, I'm so happy to go to the world.

1579
02:34:00,110 --> 02:34:15,110
It's a very loud, hard-sake-sone, like a dodo-no-kata-nari
It's like the sound of your voice There's no time for you to

1580
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:17,830
stop, but there's no time for you.

1581
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:20,990
I'm ready, steady, go!

1582
02:34:20,990 --> 02:34:23,430
I'm out

1583
02:34:27,100 --> 02:34:42,210
I'm just counting I'm just so glad I'm not alone The story
is so loud Even though I'm still no doubt On that black

1584
02:34:42,210 --> 02:34:58,790
light On that red red light I was able to hear I was just
like that You know all things like that I'm just in an I'm

1585
02:34:58,790 --> 02:34:59,010
just enjoying I'm so excited

1586
02:35:21,050 --> 02:35:23,490
The song is so good.

1587
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:36,620
Very steady, can't hold me back.

1588
02:35:37,640 --> 02:35:40,000
Ready, steady, give me good luck.

1589
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:49,480
What's

1590
02:35:55,550 --> 02:35:56,770
going on in this music video?

1591
02:35:56,890 --> 02:35:57,770
I don't know.

1592
02:36:05,740 --> 02:36:06,620
So crazy.

1593
02:36:37,950 --> 02:36:38,930
It's so crazy.

1594
02:36:42,030 --> 02:36:44,490
Never know what's going on in these music videos.

1595
02:36:45,910 --> 02:36:49,830
Like, when did they, why did they film them is the biggest
question to me.

1596
02:36:51,090 --> 02:36:57,370
Like, what is, what is, oh, I guess I should have adjusted
the key before I did the song, but that's okay.

1597
02:36:58,390 --> 02:37:00,310
That's one thing I forget you can do on here.

1598
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:03,370
Like, I just...

1599
02:37:05,390 --> 02:37:07,130
Oh, someone requested Inno Yasha earlier.

1600
02:37:07,250 --> 02:37:08,210
I want to do Inno Yasha.

1601
02:37:09,270 --> 02:37:12,170
And then also... Wait, okay, there's a couple of...
Natsukashi...

1602
02:37:13,090 --> 02:37:13,890
Wait, wrong one.

1603
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,230
Sorry.

1604
02:37:14,470 --> 02:37:20,610
A couple of nostalgic songs that I was thinking of.

1605
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:24,550
Inno Yasha!

1606
02:37:26,610 --> 02:37:28,290
Maybe they're trying to escape the cold.

1607
02:37:31,390 --> 02:37:33,090
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

1608
02:37:33,450 --> 02:37:35,710
There's quite moody, but...

1609
02:37:35,710 --> 02:37:35,910
I don't know.

1610
02:37:37,810 --> 02:37:39,450
This one's easy to find.

1611
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:41,770
Brand new world!

1612
02:37:42,010 --> 02:37:44,550
I want to change the world.

1613
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:49,890
I remember they had Ready City Go as the final song in the
original Owen Dandias game.

1614
02:37:50,030 --> 02:37:50,550
Wait, really?

1615
02:37:50,730 --> 02:37:51,510
That's awesome.

1616
02:37:55,260 --> 02:37:55,680
Oh, sorry.

1617
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:57,780
I keep forgetting to turn off turn off the dang camera.

1618
02:38:03,280 --> 02:38:05,340
Shinjits no, it's probably most likely.

1619
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:06,320
Where is it?

1620
02:38:07,680 --> 02:38:08,100
Oh, there it is.

1621
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:10,820
How does this one go?

1622
02:38:11,420 --> 02:38:12,660
I love Yuda Yuda!

1623
02:38:12,940 --> 02:38:14,080
Wait, can I sing this one?

1624
02:38:14,340 --> 02:38:15,280
This one's from the movie!

1625
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:16,640
It's one of my favorite movies.

1626
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:18,820
My favorite Inuyasha movie.

1627
02:38:20,800 --> 02:38:21,260
Is it okay?

1628
02:38:21,480 --> 02:38:22,560
I love this song.

1629
02:38:35,830 --> 02:38:38,530
I'll try the Chidits No Uta after.

1630
02:39:10,170 --> 02:39:14,730
The world is all over the world, in the world.

1631
02:39:15,550 --> 02:39:16,650
Bang, bang, bang.

1632
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:17,070
Looking for the world.

1633
02:39:17,070 --> 02:39:23,570
A love-in-law's antennae, with a wish, bang, bang.

1634
02:39:23,810 --> 02:39:31,010
A gloomy sky is clear, with the light that's all light.

1635
02:39:31,010 --> 02:39:31,730
What the hell?

1636
02:39:32,090 --> 02:39:34,170
No one knows what's wrong.

1637
02:39:34,170 --> 02:39:38,470
A blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue.

1638
02:39:41,790 --> 02:39:50,830
iral hero I of my wick I

1639
02:39:56,480 --> 02:40:22,110
knew that In a very normal season,

1640
02:40:30,440 --> 02:40:34,800
I'm slowly sabotaging it.

1641
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:40,480
It's not just in our own life, and it's not you.

1642
02:40:43,610 --> 02:40:51,470
No matter what you know, no matter what you know, all the
small stars just go and you go out and go.

1643
02:40:51,510 --> 02:40:55,170
Oh, on your way to your friends.

1644
02:40:58,390 --> 02:40:59,330
Now, I

1645
02:41:05,790 --> 02:41:08,230
threw me off, man.

1646
02:41:19,650 --> 02:41:25,150
Saga-septi-mortem-tah-quickly-mortemly-noyant-noying
Negray-committer.

1647
02:41:26,690 --> 02:41:33,490
Gumbory-solar-w-tooking-nook-thickety-hickery-sac-shy-thickery.

1648
02:41:51,090 --> 02:42:01,560
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1649
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:17,380
The cat looks way worse than the bunny.

1650
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:24,060
The cat looks so scary in the bunnies.

1651
02:42:29,120 --> 02:42:29,940
My god.

1652
02:42:30,580 --> 02:42:32,300
Just him appearing out of nowhere.

1653
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:33,760
Wow.

1654
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:36,200
I thought it was like a normal music video.

1655
02:42:37,100 --> 02:42:38,060
It's so funny.

1656
02:42:39,620 --> 02:42:40,100
Oh.

1657
02:42:41,720 --> 02:42:42,420
So.

1658
02:42:57,130 --> 02:42:57,650
funny.

1659
02:42:58,770 --> 02:43:01,370
Peaking behind the tree is so scary.

1660
02:43:03,430 --> 02:43:06,150
Oh, wait.

1661
02:43:06,290 --> 02:43:08,890
I want just Inuyasha, not Inuyasha movie.

1662
02:43:09,610 --> 02:43:10,010
Dang it.

1663
02:43:10,490 --> 02:43:11,490
Wait, what is this one?

1664
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:14,310
What was the other song in that movie?

1665
02:43:17,450 --> 02:43:19,390
Oh, I'm gonna listen to it.

1666
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:25,300
Wait.

1667
02:43:26,260 --> 02:43:32,340
The thing that's also really difficult, I'm trying to make
excuses for why i keep messing up but like the timing is off

1668
02:43:32,340 --> 02:43:41,040
because there is the since i'm watching through obs so do
you remember this song

1669
02:43:45,270 --> 02:43:48,110
oh this song was so good i remember

1670
02:43:55,890 --> 02:43:57,490
yeah oh my gosh

1671
02:44:02,650 --> 02:44:08,590
I was able to hear the sound of my life.

1672
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:15,530
I remember it all.

1673
02:44:15,530 --> 02:44:21,890
It was a warm, warm feeling, it was all about all about my
body.

1674
02:44:23,270 --> 02:44:31,910
I couldn't hear anyone's voice, but I couldn't hear my
voice.

1675
02:44:33,390 --> 02:44:35,110
Wait, am I getting that right?

1676
02:44:35,530 --> 02:44:38,570
Don't be eating that right?

1677
02:44:39,070 --> 02:44:40,590
Don't be that bad.

1678
02:44:40,590 --> 02:44:40,770
No,

1679
02:44:44,130 --> 02:44:44,130
no.

1680
02:44:45,870 --> 02:44:45,930
Don't be.

1681
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:53,680
Don't be such a

1682
02:45:00,900 --> 02:45:03,080
mean like, right?

1683
02:45:03,760 --> 02:45:04,740
I will be right here.

1684
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:10,760
Our fallout is a chitzy And we're all

1685
02:45:21,640 --> 02:45:42,540
there, it's a chitzy The hands of the That's not where we're
at That's where our planet The earth can't Ever since we

1686
02:45:42,540 --> 02:45:54,860
knew There's no But where we go wherever we go Any time, any
time, any place, any place, there is a certain love that is

1687
02:45:54,860 --> 02:45:57,020
true.

1688
02:45:57,020 --> 02:46:09,600
So, it's not just about the saddest, it's about the saddest,
it's about the love of the world.

1689
02:46:10,340 --> 02:46:13,340
It's a warm, warm, warm,

1690

when they're like they're like at the camp Oh my god, I love
this movie.

1692
02:46:57,420 --> 02:46:58,140
It's so good.

1693
02:46:59,160 --> 02:47:00,380
He's thinking about cult.

1694
02:47:02,200 --> 02:47:03,880
He's just like skinny pea.

1695
02:47:04,200 --> 02:47:05,520
You're right.

1696
02:47:06,680 --> 02:47:06,860
You're

1697
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:12,910
right.

1698
02:47:21,610 --> 02:47:22,290
.

1699
02:47:25,890 --> 02:47:26,570
.

1700
02:47:26,570 --> 02:47:26,850
.

1701
02:47:29,650 --> 02:47:30,330
.

1702
02:47:30,350 --> 02:47:33,870
Don't be a lie to me right now.

1703
02:47:35,010 --> 02:47:37,390
Come here,

1704
02:47:42,370 --> 02:47:43,530
come here, come here to see me.

1705
02:47:43,530 --> 02:47:50,200
In this world, What are you seeing?

1706
02:47:51,700 --> 02:47:53,240
What are you seeing?

1707
02:47:54,640 --> 02:47:59,440
What are you seeing?

1708
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:06,120
Is that Tama Shite?

1709
02:48:06,220 --> 02:48:06,880
Tama Shite?

1710
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:07,600
Isn't that right?

1711
02:48:12,820 --> 02:48:14,460
Wait, Wait, I don't know.

1712
02:48:24,780 --> 02:48:26,400
Oh my gosh.

1713
02:48:26,620 --> 02:48:27,220
No, Koshite.

1714
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:28,840
I'm wrong then.

1715
02:48:32,360 --> 02:48:32,620
Man.

1716
02:48:33,860 --> 02:48:34,960
Oh, he's so sad.

1717
02:48:35,540 --> 02:48:36,180
My kanji.

1718
02:48:36,280 --> 02:48:38,200
I need to remember my kanji

1719
02:48:44,800 --> 02:48:58,660
I just okay I don't know if I'll sing I don't know if I'll
sing the song since to know what that but I'll try

1720
02:49:02,480 --> 02:49:10,900
I'll be honest guys I never really liked Kaimori I think
it's like a nostalgia thing that I like it, but...

1721
02:49:10,900 --> 02:49:12,080
But I just, I don't know...

1722
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:20,340
I'll try.

1723
02:49:26,220 --> 02:49:28,580
We've had this music video like 10 times now.

1724
02:49:50,290 --> 02:49:54,170
I've seen it all.

1725
02:49:54,290 --> 02:50:13,550
Now, now, now, now, now, this is the way I'm drawing in the
sun, the sky and the sky is the only I'm only here for you

1726
02:50:13,550 --> 02:50:16,750
to find my life.

1727
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:19,970
I'm more than I can get you.

1728
02:50:19,970 --> 02:50:27,530
I'm more so now, I'm stronger, I'm more than you are now, to
do.

1729
02:50:28,350 --> 02:50:32,730
I'm just so small and just I'm going to hurt myself.

1730
02:50:36,470 --> 02:50:37,790
You're hurting me.

1731
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:38,870
So you're only one.

1732
02:50:56,430 --> 02:50:59,910
No, we got the lesbians!

1733
02:51:14,300 --> 02:51:17,080
I'm sorry.

1734
02:51:20,980 --> 02:51:22,740
.

1735
02:51:22,740 --> 02:51:22,980
.

1736
02:51:22,980 --> 02:51:23,740
.

1737
02:51:41,820 --> 02:52:04,640
For example, someone's Yes, a smile, For a long time, If you
die, No doubt, No doubt, No, No, No, No, No, No, No, No No

1738
02:52:04,640 --> 02:52:24,600
No, No, I'm gonna go back to the sky, someday I'll get to
know the truth of the song as a sign of the way to make it

1739
02:52:26,480 --> 02:52:43,300
and forever and forever, all the dark, the pain will always
disappear and the truth of the world and the world me

1740
02:53:15,300 --> 02:53:17,200
Oh my gosh, that song is hard.

1741
02:53:18,340 --> 02:53:18,740
Never mind.

1742
02:53:19,320 --> 02:53:20,520
I'm not going to sing that one again.

1743
02:53:24,610 --> 02:53:26,150
But the Yuri was happening.

1744
02:53:27,670 --> 02:53:27,910
Nice.

1745
02:53:29,270 --> 02:53:32,130
Um, but mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum, mum.

1746
02:53:33,090 --> 02:53:34,110
What's like another?

1747
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:38,230
Oh my gosh, thank you so much for the rhythm, rag!

1748
02:53:38,930 --> 02:53:40,250
Soft, soft, tender.

1749

Thank you!

1750
02:53:43,150 --> 02:53:45,370
For your consideration, can I submit Hatsukoi Sider or
Katsuki?

1751
02:53:45,390 --> 02:53:46,010
calendar girl.

1752
02:53:46,270 --> 02:53:51,310
Oh, I could do a calendar girl because how to go inside her
is very easy to sing.

1753
02:53:51,550 --> 02:53:52,510
Let's do calendar girl.

1754
02:53:52,890 --> 02:53:52,890
Cal.

1755
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:54,870

1756
02:53:57,230 --> 02:53:57,430
Hmm.

1757
02:53:59,490 --> 02:54:02,410
Actually, well, no, I shouldn't have searched calendar girl.

1758
02:54:02,790 --> 02:54:03,870
I think there's like more than one.

1759
02:54:04,530 --> 02:54:04,770
There you go.

1760
02:54:04,830 --> 02:54:05,670

The song is fun.

1763
02:54:10,310 --> 02:54:11,390
Or the dance is fun too.

1764
02:54:12,810 --> 02:54:14,610
Wait, I'm probably gonna butcher it.

1765
02:54:14,930 --> 02:54:18,810
It's It's hard to sing as one person, but I'll do my best.

1766
02:54:21,850 --> 02:54:23,390
Maybe they'll do the effects for me.

1767
02:54:33,390 --> 02:54:44,510
Sunday, Monday, Choo Choo Choo Day Makeup with the calendar

Aikaru Katsu though.

1777
02:59:15,860 --> 02:59:16,800
But the music video?

1778
02:59:16,940 --> 02:59:18,900
Oh my gosh, wait, it reminded me of something.

1779
02:59:22,060 --> 02:59:23,360
I wonder if they have...

1780
02:59:23,360 --> 02:59:23,880
They should.

1781
02:59:29,010 --> 02:59:31,170
I'm trying to decide how I want to search it.

1782
02:59:32,230 --> 02:59:35,050
Japanese music videos look like they were very economical to
produce.

1783
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:39,670
Well, these are like, they're specifically made for Joy
Sound for like the karaoke.

1784
02:59:40,330 --> 02:59:43,470
So they're not... I want to call the music videos but...

1785
02:59:44,150 --> 02:59:52,470
I forgot what I was gonna look up.

1786
02:59:52,550 --> 02:59:54,470
What's another?

1787
02:59:58,690 --> 02:59:59,050
Um...

1788
03:00:02,430 --> 03:00:03,150
What's another...

1789
03:00:03,150 --> 03:00:03,990
What does he...

1790
03:00:03,990 --> 03:00:05,990
Oh my gosh, wait, I don't remember how that goes.

1791
03:00:06,490 --> 03:00:07,590
Oh yeah, wait, let's do it!

1792
03:00:07,630 --> 03:00:08,390
Let's try...

1793
03:00:08,930 --> 03:00:09,290
He...

1794
03:00:09,790 --> 03:00:11,350
Let's see what Higurashi is talking to him.

1795
03:00:17,520 --> 03:00:18,780
Wait, oh they have...

1796
03:00:18,780 --> 03:00:19,140
Wait, boy.

1797
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:20,180
I like how they...

1798
03:00:20,180 --> 03:00:20,680
Look at this.

1799
03:00:21,240 --> 03:00:25,480
They specifically have Higurashi no Nakakoroni, slot, and
pachinko.

1800
03:00:27,880 --> 03:00:28,980
Let me try...

1801
03:00:28,980 --> 03:00:30,500
Wait, I don't...

1802
03:00:30,500 --> 03:00:32,180
Can you do more than just those?

1803
03:00:32,960 --> 03:00:34,520
Sotsu and Gyo-goo?

1804
03:00:36,940 --> 03:00:38,480
This is caught...

1805
03:00:38,480 --> 03:00:40,680
Wait, Higurashi...

1806
03:00:42,540 --> 03:00:46,320
I'm just gonna look up Higurashi no Nakakoroni itself and
not click.

1807
03:00:46,340 --> 03:00:48,800
I'm gonna...

1808
03:00:48,800 --> 03:00:51,900
Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo, Kolo.

1809
03:00:52,440 --> 03:00:52,940
Where's Kolo?

1810
03:00:53,060 --> 03:00:53,540
Oh, I'm stupid.

1811
03:00:53,780 --> 03:00:58,220
Kolo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo, lo.

1812
03:00:58,900 --> 03:00:59,980
That should be enough.

1813
03:01:00,540 --> 03:01:00,700
Ah!

1814
03:01:01,060 --> 03:01:01,680
That's fine.

1815
03:01:09,530 --> 03:01:12,090
Oh my god, this is wrong by Asaka!

1816
03:01:12,970 --> 03:01:14,010
I love Asaka!

1817
03:01:14,610 --> 03:01:15,890
I love Asaka, I love Asaka.

1818
03:01:16,930 --> 03:01:17,450
I love Asaka.

1819
03:01:24,990 --> 03:01:30,210
Oh my gosh, this song, this next to this, reminded me of
happy material.

1820
03:01:43,230 --> 03:01:44,830
Did they have Dario?

1821
03:01:46,550 --> 03:01:47,050
They don't!

1822
03:01:48,350 --> 03:01:48,910
Why?

1823
03:01:50,410 --> 03:01:51,910
They don't even have like you.

1824
03:01:52,990 --> 03:01:54,330
They don't have any of the you songs.

1825
03:01:55,390 --> 03:01:56,050
Why?

1826
03:01:56,790 --> 03:01:57,270
Interesting.

1827
03:02:03,490 --> 03:02:04,330
That's crazy.

1828
03:02:08,660 --> 03:02:11,600
Kami-sama no syndrome is really good too.

1829
03:02:11,940 --> 03:02:14,140
I like the songs from the new series a lot.

1830
03:02:17,060 --> 03:02:18,380
What do I say?

1831
03:02:19,080 --> 03:02:20,240
Because I love her.

1832
03:02:21,740 --> 03:02:23,380
Wait, do I remember how this goes?

1833
03:02:25,140 --> 03:02:25,800
What?

1834
03:03:07,520 --> 03:03:16,060
I believe in what you said I want to know where I want to
go.

1835
03:03:16,060 --> 03:03:33,220
A clear, clear, clear, clear, I've always loved your joy,
and always your your tears, even more, more than any other,

1836
03:03:33,220 --> 03:03:37,840
much-riga-nigh-nigh in the feeling the memories.

1837
03:03:38,460 --> 03:04:05,700
Just one, The music video?

1838
03:04:06,100 --> 03:04:06,340
Hello?

1839
03:04:06,340 --> 03:04:06,680
Oh!

1840
03:04:09,560 --> 03:04:13,340
I'm getting distracted, I'm getting seduced right now.

1841
03:04:14,200 --> 03:04:42,480
I believe what you say, When I opened my eyes, my eyes were
red, my eyes were red, and my eyes were red.

1842
03:04:42,640 --> 03:04:44,060
My eyes were red, and my eyes were red.

1843
03:04:44,060 --> 03:04:51,320
I wanted to know more about you, and I wanted to follow you.

1844
03:04:51,880 --> 03:04:55,040
Unnatural, unsoverely, no-mong-nothing.

1845
03:04:55,820 --> 03:04:57,480
I used the words.

1846
03:04:57,480 --> 03:05:14,800
This song is so hard.

1847
03:05:31,960 --> 03:05:34,260
But not me, I'm focused.

1848
03:06:07,970 --> 03:06:08,610
.

1849
03:06:08,610 --> 03:06:09,090
.

1850
03:06:10,670 --> 03:06:11,750
.

1851
03:06:11,750 --> 03:06:12,530
.

1852
03:06:34,470 --> 03:06:39,660
I get it girl!

03:06:40,140 --> 03:06:41,180
You're so sexy!

1854
03:06:43,000 --> 03:06:44,620
Thinking this was the right choice!

1855
03:06:46,320 --> 03:06:53,240
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, nice.

1856
03:06:55,080 --> 03:06:55,640
Yeah.

1857
03:06:56,920 --> 03:06:58,420
She was so sexy.

1858
03:07:01,580 --> 03:07:02,360
Hot there.

1859
03:07:02,760 --> 03:07:03,460
I don't know.

1860
03:07:05,560 --> 03:07:07,640
Wow, it's already been three hours.

1861
03:07:09,380 --> 03:07:10,220
Let's see.

1862
03:07:10,540 --> 03:07:12,020
What else do I want to sing?

1863
03:07:12,220 --> 03:07:12,820
I'm just thinking.

1864
03:07:13,980 --> 03:07:14,580
I'm going to sing.

1865
03:07:15,080 --> 03:07:15,220
What?

1866
03:07:15,320 --> 03:07:15,880
Wake up, girl.

1867
03:07:16,020 --> 03:07:16,240
What?

1868
03:07:17,780 --> 03:07:18,660
Wake, wake.

1869
03:07:21,020 --> 03:07:22,140
Wake up, girls.

1870
03:07:23,200 --> 03:07:24,160
Thinking of eye cuts.

1871
03:07:24,380 --> 03:07:25,460
I don't think I'll wake up, girls.

1872
03:07:25,840 --> 03:07:26,000
Nope.

1873
03:07:27,260 --> 03:07:31,390
Wake up, girls.

1874
03:07:37,570 --> 03:07:37,830
No!

1875
03:07:40,310 --> 03:07:41,190
Wait, maybe...

1876
03:07:41,190 --> 03:07:42,970
Let me try, like, searching, oh, a song name.

1877
03:07:43,490 --> 03:07:45,310
Thanks so much for feeling my Hugo Rashi brain worms.

1878
03:07:46,110 --> 03:07:48,230
Sorry that they didn't have any of the U songs.

1879
03:07:49,550 --> 03:07:50,430
Let's try.

1880
03:07:52,810 --> 03:07:53,930
Let's see...

1881
03:07:55,690 --> 03:07:56,250
Uh...

1882
03:07:56,250 --> 03:07:57,650
Maybe we can go from there.

1883
03:08:00,910 --> 03:08:02,050
It's that first one right there.

1884
03:08:05,970 --> 03:08:06,270
Hey!

1885
03:08:06,590 --> 03:08:08,470
Why don't you show up?

1886
03:08:08,610 --> 03:08:08,910
Hello?

1887
03:08:09,690 --> 03:08:10,370
I'm angry.

1888
03:08:11,010 --> 03:08:11,650
I'm angry.

1889
03:08:12,510 --> 03:08:13,630
Why don't you show up?

1890
03:08:19,310 --> 03:08:19,870

1891
03:08:23,510 --> 03:08:24,070

1892
03:08:27,430 --> 03:08:29,510

I know it, but I don't remember it.

1896
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:40,970
Did you think Robert is a bitch?

1897
03:08:41,050 --> 03:08:42,390
Yeah, you missed it.

1898
03:08:52,710 --> 03:08:53,970
I'll sing this.

1899
03:08:54,090 --> 03:08:55,990
When I do 3D next.

1900
03:08:57,510 --> 03:08:57,910
Seven senses.

1901
03:08:58,290 --> 03:08:59,590
Oh, I do kind of remember this one.

1902
03:08:59,710 --> 03:09:01,030
It was not my favorite.

1903
03:09:09,660 --> 03:09:11,660
I don't know pound cake.

1904
03:09:12,580 --> 03:09:13,800
Have you sung any Dempogumi today?

1905
03:09:14,300 --> 03:09:15,600
No, we'll sing it right after.

1906
03:09:17,460 --> 03:09:20,100

I'm back, I'm back.

1925
03:14:44,380 --> 03:14:46,720
That's how I learned songs, or that's how I learned dances.

1926
03:14:51,340 --> 03:14:53,540
That's how I, that's my little process in my head.

1927
03:14:53,680 --> 03:14:57,380
I'm like, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da,

1928
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:01,040
What did I say?

1929
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:02,160
I was gonna look for after Wug?

1930
03:15:02,320 --> 03:15:02,730
I don't remember.

1931
03:15:07,390 --> 03:15:08,410
Thanks for sliding, boss.

1932
03:15:08,550 --> 03:15:08,970
Oh, cool!

1933
03:15:14,030 --> 03:15:14,570
So...

1934
03:15:14,570 --> 03:15:15,730
Waguna dattan naka.

1935
03:15:16,790 --> 03:15:17,430
So desu!

1936
03:15:18,310 --> 03:15:19,530
Miu-chan osi desu.

1937
03:15:20,350 --> 03:15:21,330
Denpa-gumi!

1938
03:15:23,430 --> 03:15:25,290
Song requests are at your days?

1939
03:15:25,630 --> 03:15:26,930
Probably not this time.

1940
03:15:28,370 --> 03:15:30,450
Because that one's very easy for me to sing.

1941
03:15:33,150 --> 03:15:34,430
But there's lots of...

1942
03:15:34,450 --> 03:15:37,290
of karyokis of it, so I can sing it anytime.

1943
03:15:41,910 --> 03:15:43,110
What tempo song should we sing?

1944
03:15:45,250 --> 03:15:50,970
What tempo song should we sing?

1945
03:15:50,970 --> 03:15:55,510
I do have a Christmas song.

1946
03:15:56,410 --> 03:15:57,350
Orange over here.

1947
03:15:58,950 --> 03:16:00,350
Their songs are very difficult, though.

1948
03:16:03,910 --> 03:16:12,290
That's passion you won't you're right i won't because it's
too hard hey yo damn it's too hard

1949
03:16:15,490 --> 03:16:17,350
no more cute

1950
03:16:24,460 --> 03:16:26,620
they put this on here

1951
03:16:42,200 --> 03:16:44,160
They put WWD ending?

1952
03:16:44,340 --> 03:16:45,140
This is their final...

1953
03:16:45,140 --> 03:16:45,920
So this is one of my...

1954
03:16:45,920 --> 03:16:48,160
This is my favorite idol group, basically.

1955
03:16:48,240 --> 03:16:50,180
One of my favorite idol groups, but...

1956
03:16:51,840 --> 03:16:52,240
They...

1957
03:16:52,240 --> 03:16:53,860
They disbanded...

1958
03:16:53,860 --> 03:16:56,180
Basically, almost a year ago today.

1959
03:16:56,960 --> 03:16:58,800
Like, they disbanded a year ago this month.

1960
03:16:59,180 --> 03:17:00,440
Like, it was a...

1961
03:17:00,440 --> 03:17:02,120
It was just after New Year's.

1962
03:17:04,160 --> 03:17:05,480
They have WWD...

1963
03:17:05,480 --> 03:17:07,080
This is their final song!

1964
03:17:08,080 --> 03:17:09,400
Oh my gosh.

1965
03:17:10,180 --> 03:17:11,640
Oh, it's too sad!

1966
03:17:14,420 --> 03:17:21,400
Yeah, so they- so basically the group- I did a whole
karaoke, a whole Dumpa gloomy karaoke if you want to hear

1967
03:17:21,400 --> 03:17:22,460
more Dumpa songs.

1968
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:31,420
Um, but see they have WWD2 here, and then they have a WWD
somewhere.

1969
03:17:33,780 --> 03:17:34,300
Somewhere.

1970
03:17:34,300 --> 03:17:34,820
WWD.

1971
03:17:35,600 --> 03:17:51,500
And then they had- because they are worldwide DEMPA and WWD
is kind of about how the girls all met so the mains the not

1972
03:17:51,500 --> 03:18:02,400
the original six but the the group had like a originally had
well the core group was originally six girls that's where

1973
03:18:02,400 --> 03:18:10,960
most people knew them as and each girl was kind of like a
loner otaku like type like they kind of were that don't fit

1974
03:18:10,960 --> 03:18:21,180
in they get bullied and everything like that and so WWD was
about their stories about each person and uh and everything

1975
03:18:21,180 --> 03:18:28,440
and how they met and and it's so like emotional and how they
just want to be idols like they Dempogumi changed the idol

1976
03:18:28,440 --> 03:18:36,220
industry and I don't mean that like in a in like I'm not
exaggerating literally at all like before Dempogumi like

1977
03:18:36,220 --> 03:18:43,860
idols had such a different image and then these girls were
older and they were like not your typical like everything

1978
03:18:43,860 --> 03:18:57,420
was so different about them and uh and just so much that
they've done for the industry is just amazing and um heck

1979
03:18:57,420 --> 03:19:05,920
yeah yeah they're awesome and so you know they did they had
wwd which was It's just like, we're not your conventional

1980
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:08,440
girls, but one day we're going to shine big horn stage.

1981
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:12,520
They're like, we're right now on this tiny little stage
because they started at deer stage.

1982
03:19:14,380 --> 03:19:16,620
And then they're like, one day we'll make it big.

1983
03:19:17,020 --> 03:19:17,580
And they did.

1984
03:19:17,780 --> 03:19:18,320
They did.

1985
03:19:18,840 --> 03:19:29,240
And then WWD too is kind of more about their struggles, but
more so like, just like, you know, am I even necessary?

1986
03:19:29,340 --> 03:19:30,740
Like do I need it here?

1987
03:19:30,920 --> 03:19:31,880
Like things like that.

1988
03:19:31,940 --> 03:19:32,840
And they're just like, yeah.

1989
03:19:34,240 --> 03:19:34,680
Nyaru!

1990
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:36,580
Thank you for the read the work!

1991
03:19:36,800 --> 03:19:37,280
Hello, hello!

1992
03:19:37,420 --> 03:19:40,620
Sorry, I'm giving history lesson on Dempogumi Inc right now.

1993
03:19:43,360 --> 03:19:43,800
So...

1994
03:19:45,660 --> 03:19:47,860
Yeah, so that was like WWD2.

1995
03:19:48,100 --> 03:19:55,320
And then they had WWD Best, and WWD Best was right before
they went on like a big hiatus.

1996
03:19:55,940 --> 03:20:00,840
And after that hi- in the midst of that hiatus, one of the
core six members left.

1997
03:20:01,460 --> 03:20:03,560
And it was like, everyone was like, oh my gosh, is this
dope?

1998
03:20:03,780 --> 03:20:07,700
And this felt, WWD best, it feels like an ending song, you
know?

1999
03:20:08,860 --> 03:20:09,120
So.

2000
03:20:11,280 --> 03:20:12,580
Dorygo, thank you so much for the five!

2001
03:20:12,780 --> 03:20:13,600
Gifted, thank you.

2002
03:20:14,760 --> 03:20:16,820
I'm not looking for difficulty, no, no.

2003
03:20:18,480 --> 03:20:21,940
I mean, difficulty in trying to find a karaoke of it is what
I mean.

2004
03:20:22,240 --> 03:20:23,740
Thank you, Scypto, thank you so much for the gift.

2005
03:20:25,780 --> 03:20:31,220
And so, then they came back and they had like a new, not a
whole new lineup, but they added a few new members.

2006
03:20:33,780 --> 03:20:41,640
got a bit rocky it was a little tough for them they kept
losing members and changing members and things and such now

2007
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:47,640
i think it's a bit true that i get it but they really did i
feel like they had to come back they had a really you know

2008
03:20:47,640 --> 03:20:58,580
but they just couldn't hold it like hold the same popularity
they did in their prime so last year they decided to end the

2009
03:20:58,580 --> 03:21:00,660
group and it was so sad

2010
03:21:08,220 --> 03:21:17,060
song i've that's all i've been singing i've only been
singing any song literally i think i don't i have not sung a

2011
03:21:17,060 --> 03:21:27,480
japanese song that was not any song maybe one day they do
like a little reunion concert well i was i i couldn't go

2012
03:21:27,480 --> 03:21:38,320
unfortunately but right now they're doing like an exhibition
where um they have they have like concert they did It's

2013
03:21:38,320 --> 03:21:44,640
called like, they did a, they did a show where it was like a
bunch of people that create, that created things for Dempa.

2014
03:21:45,360 --> 03:21:48,180
They came together and did like a show and stuff.

2015
03:21:48,360 --> 03:21:51,580
And right now they have like the old shutter from Deer
Stage.

2016
03:21:52,240 --> 03:21:52,820
It broke.

2017
03:21:53,240 --> 03:21:59,580
So right now it's on display with a bunch of Dempa, um, old
uniforms and costumes and stuff.

2018
03:21:59,900 --> 03:22:03,180
And yeah, so.

2019
03:22:05,560 --> 03:22:06,600
It's been nice.

2020
03:22:10,830 --> 03:22:11,110
Yeah.

2021
03:22:11,130 --> 03:22:12,910
That's why it's just been blank recently?

2022
03:22:13,110 --> 03:22:14,850
Yeah, yeah, that's why it's been blank.

2023
03:22:16,290 --> 03:22:18,630
I don't even know if I could sing this.

2024
03:22:23,550 --> 03:22:24,910
I just want to hear it though.

2025
03:22:25,570 --> 03:22:27,610
I want to hear how the karaoke sounds.

2026
03:22:34,540 --> 03:22:36,040
This is my passion.

2027
03:22:41,590 --> 03:22:46,590
Actually that calendar girl song that I did, that was also
sung by a member of Deer Stage.

2028
03:23:11,050 --> 03:23:14,110
Oh my god.

2029
03:23:17,990 --> 03:23:22,290
This is about how they were a group for 16 years and now
it's over.

2030
03:23:31,790 --> 03:23:32,210
.

2031
03:23:33,310 --> 03:23:33,730
.

2032
03:23:35,330 --> 03:23:35,750
.

2033
03:23:38,190 --> 03:23:38,610
.

2034
03:23:38,610 --> 03:23:39,010
.

2035
03:23:39,010 --> 03:23:39,070
.

2036
03:23:41,230 --> 03:23:41,650
.

2037
03:23:41,650 --> 03:23:41,770
.

2038
03:23:43,630 --> 03:23:44,050
.

2039
03:23:44,050 --> 03:23:44,110
.

2040
03:24:02,880 --> 03:24:04,280
I

2041
03:24:08,240 --> 03:24:11,300
can't sing the song at all.

2042
03:24:12,360 --> 03:24:13,180
It's so cool.

2043
03:24:13,340 --> 03:24:19,020
These are the members.

2044
03:25:32,060 --> 03:25:36,140
I am being

2045
03:25:41,540 --> 03:25:43,900
totally selfish and just listening to this for myself.

2046
03:25:51,260 --> 03:25:52,760
This is the song.

2047
03:25:53,000 --> 03:25:56,020
This is the melody from WWD.

2048
03:27:06,960 --> 03:27:09,760
Thank you.

2049
03:27:14,590 --> 03:27:17,590
That bakumi eek so good!

2050
03:27:22,130 --> 03:27:23,130
Nailed it!

2051
03:27:23,230 --> 03:27:23,490
Yeah!

2052
03:27:29,880 --> 03:27:31,640
My voice is just about giving out.

2053
03:27:34,860 --> 03:27:36,220
That was fun?

2054
03:27:36,640 --> 03:27:37,760
Should we do one last song?

2055
03:27:37,860 --> 03:27:39,300
What would be a good song to end on?

2056
03:27:40,140 --> 03:27:41,640
One that I can properly...

2057
03:27:42,820 --> 03:27:43,600
properly sing.

2058
03:27:45,100 --> 03:27:45,600
Hmm...

2059
03:27:46,660 --> 03:27:47,160
Hmm...

2060
03:27:53,360 --> 03:27:56,160
I don't want to sing baka mita right now because I just did
it.

2061
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:58,160
If you could listen to my cover...

2062
03:27:58,860 --> 03:28:00,240
Sorry, I don't mean to like...

2063
03:28:01,240 --> 03:28:03,160
reject all your songs, but...

2064
03:28:12,450 --> 03:28:16,410
Song from... My song from Angel Beats, you know what's
interesting is like...

2065
03:28:16,410 --> 03:28:18,390
You won't find any...

2066
03:28:18,910 --> 03:28:20,870
Songs from key properties on here.

2067
03:28:22,430 --> 03:28:24,810
I think it's... I think it's the singer.

2068
03:28:24,990 --> 03:28:27,010
Leah like doesn't like putting stuff on.

2069
03:28:27,870 --> 03:28:29,490
Like let's see, if I search...

2070
03:28:29,930 --> 03:28:30,690
What's a...

2071
03:28:30,690 --> 03:28:31,170
Clonad.

2072
03:28:31,390 --> 03:28:33,390
Let's see, I could...

2073
03:28:40,310 --> 03:28:43,010
Thank you for the dinosaur ride before your karaoke!

2074
03:28:49,290 --> 03:28:51,310
You see, it doesn't even come out.

2075
03:28:51,510 --> 03:28:52,430
Let me try in English.

2076
03:28:54,310 --> 03:28:54,550
Oh, whoops.

2077
03:28:54,950 --> 03:28:56,750
It should, it should like, work though.

2078
03:28:57,910 --> 03:28:58,990
Even in Japanese.

2079
03:29:03,840 --> 03:29:04,240
You'll see.

2080
03:29:05,740 --> 03:29:06,580
Isn't that crazy?

2081
03:29:09,400 --> 03:29:16,540
That's why it's very difficult for me to sing, like, key
songs, because they just don't put them on here for some

2082
03:29:16,540 --> 03:29:16,940
reason.

2083
03:29:17,820 --> 03:29:18,640
Please keep being selfish.

2084
03:29:18,780 --> 03:29:20,160
It's always so fun when you're being selfish.

2085
03:29:21,580 --> 03:29:23,800
Thank you for letting me be selfish today.

2086
03:29:24,140 --> 03:29:26,800
This was an extremely selfish karaoke because I...

2087
03:29:28,900 --> 03:29:30,640
I... I only...

2088
03:29:31,160 --> 03:29:34,560
I only sung the dinosaur stuff.

2089
03:29:36,380 --> 03:29:38,660
Thank you for letting me be so selfish today.

2090
03:29:46,150 --> 03:29:56,970
All Dino songs Whatever doesn't make your voice died Yeah
I'll take it easy The next couple of days I'll have to take

2091
03:29:56,970 --> 03:30:00,590
it easy for the next couple of weeks For my jazz show Yeah

2092
03:30:06,290 --> 03:30:13,950
Oops all dino's Has been very fun When you're having fun
We're having fun Yeah What?

2093
03:30:16,050 --> 03:30:17,310
What's a song that I'm not?

2094
03:30:30,010 --> 03:30:32,390
It's more fun this way when you sing whatever you want,
Minto.

2095
03:30:32,770 --> 03:30:33,450
Thank you!

2096
03:30:35,630 --> 03:30:37,010
We love your song selection.

2097
03:30:37,230 --> 03:30:38,270
You're singing, My Soul is Healed.

2098
03:30:38,510 --> 03:30:38,750
Really?

2099
03:30:41,050 --> 03:30:41,790
Thank you.

2100
03:30:42,470 --> 03:30:43,550
There are more tickets coming out for that.

2101
03:30:43,690 --> 03:30:44,330
They're super sold out.

2102
03:30:44,590 --> 03:30:46,070
Yes, there's gonna be a second show!

2103
03:30:47,150 --> 03:30:51,170
There will be a second show, so you can get tickets to that.

2104
03:30:51,310 --> 03:30:54,110
Or there is the streaming show.

2105
03:30:55,950 --> 03:30:57,250
I always appreciate Aminto karaoke.

2106
03:30:57,450 --> 03:30:58,330
Thank you!

2107
03:30:58,430 --> 03:30:59,910
Thank you, thank you!

2108
03:31:01,150 --> 03:31:02,030
Yeah, yeah.

2109
03:31:05,310 --> 03:31:06,350
I enjoy myself immensely.

2110
03:31:06,530 --> 03:31:08,970
I hope you do these selfish karyokis in the future.

2111
03:31:12,530 --> 03:31:13,410
Thank you.

2112
03:31:14,390 --> 03:31:15,370
Second show, same venue?

2113
03:31:15,470 --> 03:31:17,250
Yeah, it's even the same day and everything.

2114
03:31:28,100 --> 03:31:29,860
Hold on, I'm getting in-spill from my room.

2115
03:31:30,420 --> 03:31:31,800
Which is mostly Metal Gear.

2116
03:31:31,920 --> 03:31:32,200
Wait.

2117
03:31:38,050 --> 03:31:40,110
I don't think I could sing anything, but...

2118
03:32:01,860 --> 03:32:04,260
I want to sing a song that I could properly...

2119
03:32:04,260 --> 03:32:06,620
I want to finish on something I could properly sing, so I'm
not like...

2120
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:10,560
You know?

2121
03:32:13,140 --> 03:32:17,160
Thank you for the beautiful karaoke, chilling with you and
hearing your lovely voice is the very best.

2122
03:32:17,380 --> 03:32:18,100
Thank you.

2123
03:32:18,780 --> 03:32:20,080
Thank you, Mordo.

2124
03:32:20,620 --> 03:32:21,640
Kaisuma, thank you.

2125
03:32:23,180 --> 03:32:25,060
This is another idol group I really, really like.

2126
03:32:25,180 --> 03:32:26,480
Nezino cookies adore.

2127
03:32:31,500 --> 03:32:32,760
Oh, yo, yo, yo.

2128
03:32:34,600 --> 03:32:35,840
This song is so fun.

2129
03:32:37,040 --> 03:32:37,140
Oh.

2130
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:39,140
Fiction by Sumika.

2131
03:32:40,140 --> 03:32:42,020
Probably not this time, but thank you.

2132
03:32:43,360 --> 03:32:46,920
Don't want to be da, da, da, da, da, for the for the last
song.

2133
03:32:47,400 --> 03:32:48,720
I'm trying to think of another song.

2134
03:32:49,480 --> 03:32:50,040
Hold on.

2135
03:33:00,960 --> 03:33:04,780
I'm looking around my room for inspiration, and it's a bunch
of metal gear.

2136
03:33:05,040 --> 03:33:05,240
Dang it.

2137
03:33:06,480 --> 03:33:10,340
Oh wait, I don't

2138
03:33:23,610 --> 03:33:24,170
know.

2139
03:33:30,920 --> 03:33:33,660
It's like, oh, Koharu, I want to...

2140
03:33:40,330 --> 03:33:45,150
It's yeah, it's a bunch of Metal Gear Blue Archive shoot.

2141
03:33:45,910 --> 03:33:46,510
Macros.

2142
03:33:47,670 --> 03:33:50,670
I feel like most that I sing of macros, macros.

2143
03:33:55,140 --> 03:33:56,960
You, I can get on YouTube.

2144
03:34:01,270 --> 03:34:03,750
It's hard when you have so many options.

2145
03:34:05,470 --> 03:34:06,310
It's tough.

2146
03:34:10,850 --> 03:34:11,970
You cannot board none.

2147
03:34:12,410 --> 03:34:13,810
I've never sung that one before.

2148
03:34:18,970 --> 03:34:20,150
Thank you for the ticket, dude!

2149
03:34:20,370 --> 03:34:21,270
I just wanted a cover.

2150
03:34:21,510 --> 03:34:22,850
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2151
03:34:23,950 --> 03:34:25,010
Thank you so much.

2152
03:34:27,670 --> 03:34:28,110
Special.

2153
03:34:30,690 --> 03:34:31,590
Let's not wait.

2154
03:34:33,530 --> 03:34:35,710
I wonder if they have the Nyanyan medley.

2155
03:34:36,610 --> 03:34:38,890
Oh my god, there's 24 pages!

2156
03:34:40,430 --> 03:34:41,690
Crazy, crazy work.

2157
03:34:43,430 --> 03:34:47,610
I mean, I guess since I put in macros, that would give me
literally every...

2158
03:34:47,610 --> 03:34:49,930
Every series of macros.

2159
03:34:50,910 --> 03:34:52,830
So, it makes sense.

2160
03:34:56,220 --> 03:34:57,680
Oh, it makes sense.

2161
03:34:59,540 --> 03:35:00,100
Wee!

2162
03:35:05,740 --> 03:35:07,160
Now I'm just looking.

2163
03:35:07,460 --> 03:35:08,220
Now I'm just browsing.

2164
03:35:14,670 --> 03:35:16,410
Thank you for the karaoke, Mito.

2165
03:35:16,810 --> 03:35:19,370
Always love your singing when you share passions with us,
Mito cute.

2166
03:35:19,710 --> 03:35:21,990
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

2167
03:35:23,610 --> 03:35:24,950
Really appreciate it.

2168
03:35:27,150 --> 03:35:29,850
Oh my gosh, didn't they have live versions of the song?

2169
03:35:30,230 --> 03:35:30,730
Holy cow.

2170
03:35:31,890 --> 03:35:32,730
Holy cow.

2171
03:35:36,250 --> 03:35:38,910
This is the one that we sung recently with Phoebe.

2172
03:35:39,070 --> 03:35:41,370
She did this song at...

2173
03:35:41,950 --> 03:35:43,900
the anime wiki that I learned of.

2174
03:35:46,590 --> 03:35:46,850
Yes.

2175
03:35:49,170 --> 03:35:50,830
I love the Blessed Little Queen version.

2176
03:35:53,470 --> 03:35:56,770
I'm gonna go Nick here.

2177
03:35:57,770 --> 03:35:58,450
20 more months!

2178
03:35:58,450 --> 03:35:59,450
21 more months!

2179
03:35:59,550 --> 03:36:00,270
Thank you!

2180
03:36:02,030 --> 03:36:03,030
Obama style!

2181
03:36:04,550 --> 03:36:05,550
Obama style!

2182
03:36:08,070 --> 03:36:10,810
I wanna pick something that I'm very confident in here,
guys.

2183
03:36:10,890 --> 03:36:11,930
That's why I'm having so much trouble.

2184
03:36:11,950 --> 03:36:20,150
Because it's like hard to find stuff that I haven't sung
before, or that I can't sing very often, but also that I'm

2185
03:36:20,150 --> 03:36:21,110
confident in.

2186
03:36:21,550 --> 03:36:25,990
Because, I mean, I was limited for so long.

2187
03:36:28,270 --> 03:36:34,150
I forgot so much because I was always like, oh gosh, I can
only pick from like these 10 songs.

2188
03:36:34,950 --> 03:36:37,170
So I was limited for so stinking long.

2189
03:36:46,930 --> 03:36:48,750
Sing the original Macross theme.

2190
03:36:49,370 --> 03:36:51,570
I started going through that series not too long ago.

2191
03:36:51,650 --> 03:36:52,390
The song is so cool.

2192
03:36:52,790 --> 03:36:54,490
I don't remember how it goes.

2193
03:36:55,730 --> 03:36:56,810
I don't remember how it goes.

2194
03:37:02,790 --> 03:37:03,550
We're chilling.

2195
03:37:03,830 --> 03:37:04,070
Are you?

2196
03:37:05,150 --> 03:37:06,590
One more anime song recommendations.

2197
03:37:06,790 --> 03:37:09,170
Yeah, if you just throw out stuff, I might get inspired.

2198
03:37:09,590 --> 03:37:11,810
I'll either, like, remember something or...

2199
03:37:14,370 --> 03:37:15,170
Can you rap?

2200
03:37:15,370 --> 03:37:15,630
No.

2201
03:37:15,950 --> 03:37:17,270
Actually, yeah, I'm a rap queen.

2202
03:37:20,070 --> 03:37:21,210
Send you on the save Valentine.

2203
03:37:21,290 --> 03:37:22,230
They don't have it on here.

2204
03:37:22,370 --> 03:37:23,050
They don't have it.

2205
03:37:24,270 --> 03:37:25,530
Look at the root cafe.

2206
03:37:25,710 --> 03:37:26,170
Shut up.

2207
03:37:26,370 --> 03:37:27,150
Don't mess her up.

2208
03:37:27,330 --> 03:37:28,110
Thank you so much for the fun.

2209
03:37:28,350 --> 03:37:28,770
Good dude.

2210
03:37:29,630 --> 03:37:30,790
Didn't remember love.

2211
03:37:30,970 --> 03:37:36,870
I could do that one because they have it right here, but
then they also have the blessed little queen version.

2212
03:37:37,510 --> 03:37:38,130
Such a good song.

2213
03:37:39,570 --> 03:37:39,930
Niyohime!

2214
03:37:40,170 --> 03:37:42,350
Oh my gosh, I was listening to that one last night.

2215
03:37:42,930 --> 03:37:44,630
I was like, oh, should I sing this tomorrow?

2216
03:37:45,910 --> 03:37:47,770
But that's like, I don't know if it was an ending song.

2217
03:37:49,170 --> 03:37:53,050
Na da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da.

2218
03:38:13,310 --> 03:38:14,870
Make sure this karaoke be cute.

2219
03:38:15,550 --> 03:38:18,190
It's always a treat to hear you sing when you guys should
buy your special interest.

2220
03:38:18,590 --> 03:38:19,690
Thank you!

2221
03:38:20,530 --> 03:38:21,810
Hunter Hunter first opening.

2222
03:38:22,130 --> 03:38:26,270
That's the one earlier that I was just like, I wish I could
sing this one.

2223
03:38:26,470 --> 03:38:27,430
I wish I knew it better.

2224
03:38:28,250 --> 03:38:31,550
I feel like, I think I only know the chorus.

2225
03:38:37,010 --> 03:38:38,230
Hacking to the key!

2226
03:38:45,170 --> 03:38:45,530
Toradora.

2227
03:38:52,960 --> 03:38:54,020
That gives me an idea.

2228
03:38:55,900 --> 03:38:57,500
Oh, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

2229
03:38:57,760 --> 03:38:59,680
Oh, don't, don't, don't search, don't search it.

2230
03:39:02,080 --> 03:39:03,080
Tor, toda.

2231
03:39:04,260 --> 03:39:05,680
That gives me an idea.

2232
03:39:16,350 --> 03:39:17,490
I don't know.

2233
03:39:17,690 --> 03:39:20,210
They'll say well enough, but I know it.

2234
03:39:24,090 --> 03:39:25,690
Okay, hold on.

2235
03:39:26,010 --> 03:39:26,770
This is my idea.

2236
03:39:28,910 --> 03:39:29,490
Okay, watch this.

2237
03:39:32,230 --> 03:39:33,390
It came out in 2009.

2238
03:39:35,810 --> 03:39:38,350
Let's see what anime we got in here.

2239
03:39:40,170 --> 03:39:42,170
Romeo and Cinderella.

2240
03:39:42,530 --> 03:39:44,210
Oh my god, Kimi no Shinanai Monogatari.

2241
03:39:47,350 --> 03:39:48,830
Only my railgun.

2242
03:39:49,250 --> 03:39:50,730
Look, look, look at night fever.

2243
03:39:51,610 --> 03:39:52,110
Wow!

2244
03:39:54,830 --> 03:39:55,510
Butterfly!

2245
03:39:57,350 --> 03:39:58,830
Like the butterfly!

2246
03:40:00,710 --> 03:40:01,050
No.

2247
03:40:02,230 --> 03:40:03,250
That was way...

2248
03:40:04,010 --> 03:40:05,770
No, that's not the right butterfly.

2249
03:40:06,750 --> 03:40:08,210
Melt is so good too, though.

2250
03:40:10,330 --> 03:40:11,090
Oh, bangers.

2251
03:40:11,210 --> 03:40:11,410
I know.

2252
03:40:11,510 --> 03:40:15,370
It's kind of fun to just search by a year and be like, oh my
god.

2253
03:40:15,690 --> 03:40:16,270
Oh my god!

2254
03:40:16,410 --> 03:40:17,130
Bad apple!

2255
03:40:20,130 --> 03:40:21,650
Funky monkey babies!

2256
03:40:23,470 --> 03:40:24,690
Oh my god.

2257
03:40:32,230 --> 03:40:33,090
But I don't know.

2258
03:40:33,170 --> 03:40:34,290
I don't think I know.

2259
03:40:36,070 --> 03:40:37,750
Don't say lazy.

2260
03:40:39,450 --> 03:40:39,810
Wow.

2261
03:40:39,990 --> 03:40:40,770
Taylor Swift.

2262
03:40:41,250 --> 03:40:43,310
Lady Gaga bad romance.

2263
03:40:45,190 --> 03:40:46,390
Please, bad apple.

2264
03:40:46,830 --> 03:40:47,890
Okay, I will do bad apple.

2265
03:40:52,850 --> 03:40:53,430
What version?

2266
03:40:54,490 --> 03:40:55,490
What version is this?

2267
03:40:59,170 --> 03:40:59,770
Okay.

2268
03:41:02,230 --> 03:41:04,710
Yeah, I gotta do the McDonald's version.

2269
03:42:53,810 --> 03:42:56,670
This song always means

2270
03:43:03,550 --> 03:43:12,190
me need to spit i can't i can't swallow my spit because it's
so there's still time

2271
03:43:42,190 --> 03:43:43,990
That's it, that's it.

2272
03:43:44,050 --> 03:43:46,830
You're looking for me, nobody's looking for me.

2273
03:43:47,230 --> 03:43:50,390
I'm talking about my own words, my own words.

2274
03:43:50,510 --> 03:43:53,470
I'm sad, I'm tired of it.

2275
03:43:53,950 --> 03:43:57,450
I'm not feeling anything, I'm just going to spend it all.

2276
03:43:57,450 --> 03:44:03,690
The golden words are given, but my own words are just a
little.

2277
03:44:03,990 --> 03:44:04,250
It's just a wago-sola.

2278
03:44:04,550 --> 03:44:11,190
If I'm from the world, if I'm going to move it, then I'll
change it.

2279
03:44:11,330 --> 03:44:21,630
If I'm going to grow it, If you want me to go around me, if
I want to go around me If I'm feeling sad, if I'm sad, then

2280
03:44:21,630 --> 03:44:25,210
I'm a bad boy My heart is blacker than you.

2281
03:44:26,650 --> 03:44:33,510
You know me, I know me, and I know everything about you I
don't know how to open my eyes.

2282
03:44:34,510 --> 03:44:38,990
If I open up my eyes to go around me, I grow from the dark
to darken it.

2283
03:44:44,620 --> 03:44:47,840
I feel like I'm gonna get abs from this song.

2284
03:44:48,940 --> 03:44:50,460
I have to like...

2285
03:44:51,200 --> 03:44:53,560
I have to breathe so properly with it.

2286
03:44:53,880 --> 03:44:54,500
Holy cow.

2287
03:44:55,060 --> 03:44:56,700
Wait, I'm gonna go back to 2009.

2288
03:44:57,640 --> 03:44:58,020
Please?

2289
03:45:00,160 --> 03:45:00,520
Please?

2290
03:45:02,880 --> 03:45:03,640
Send me back.

2291
03:45:10,060 --> 03:45:11,680
Sorry I messed up a couple times.

2292
03:45:11,960 --> 03:45:12,500
Oh my gosh.

2293
03:45:14,620 --> 03:45:15,960
Ew, I can baby!

2294
03:45:16,380 --> 03:45:17,500
Oh, Stinking Boy.

2295
03:45:17,600 --> 03:45:17,860
Oh, my God.

2296
03:45:18,020 --> 03:45:21,020
The 2009 version of Cruel Angels Leases.

2297
03:45:23,460 --> 03:45:23,900
Maybe.

2298
03:45:24,940 --> 03:45:25,380
Maybe.

2299
03:45:26,400 --> 03:45:29,080
This is the song that basically, well, not.

2300
03:45:29,380 --> 03:45:32,460
It's like one of the songs that like put AKB48 on the map.

2301
03:45:32,960 --> 03:45:33,460
And River!

2302
03:45:33,960 --> 03:45:36,060
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2303
03:45:37,800 --> 03:45:39,540
Okay, I'll end with this song.

2304
03:45:40,920 --> 03:45:41,740
AKB48 River.

2305
03:45:43,640 --> 03:45:44,120
Oh, my gosh.

2306
03:45:44,180 --> 03:45:44,600
Thank you so much.

2307
03:45:44,620 --> 03:45:50,660
I heard the opening notes for Bad Apple and shot out of bed
like a sleeper-raging Glory to me, though.

2308
03:45:53,500 --> 03:45:53,940
Yay!

2309
03:45:54,740 --> 03:45:54,940
Okay.

2310
03:45:55,320 --> 03:45:58,320
Sorry, I'm ending on a selfish song again, but the song is
so good.

2311
03:45:58,500 --> 03:45:59,160
The song is so good.

2312
03:46:05,430 --> 03:46:05,870
Okay.

2313
03:46:06,290 --> 03:46:06,530
Okay.

2314
03:46:07,190 --> 03:46:07,770
All right.

2315
03:46:07,950 --> 03:46:08,930
Last song, for real.

2316
03:46:09,410 --> 03:46:10,970
River by Ake before the end.

2317
03:46:13,050 --> 03:46:14,150
Is this song hard?

2318
03:46:15,290 --> 03:46:15,730
Maybe.

2319
03:46:17,650 --> 03:46:18,090
Ake.

2320
03:46:18,190 --> 03:46:18,670
B

2321
03:46:42,350 --> 03:47:04,420
Oh 48 Boom The backing vocals The backing vocals Good, one
step, step it up, believe yourself Whip,

2322
03:47:13,360 --> 03:47:29,730
straight, straight, straight, face down, Fujisan It's always
a dream, It's a long way, It's not going to be the same It's

2323
03:47:29,730 --> 03:47:41,310
a long way to feel The feet of the feet of the One of the
people with the A big smile, big smile The big smile No, no,

2324
03:47:42,170 --> 03:47:43,390
no, no.

2325
03:47:43,610 --> 03:48:01,490
The river's wide, and wide, big, big, big, big dark, deep,
but the water's fast, I don't know, I'm not afraid, I'm not

2326
03:48:01,490 --> 03:48:02,790
afraid, but I'm afraid.

2327
03:48:03,790 --> 03:48:08,170
Yeah, there's no, there's more.

2328
03:48:11,250 --> 03:48:16,690
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it.

2329
03:48:16,690 --> 03:48:20,210
YAMI, no, no, no, okay.

2330
03:48:20,790 --> 03:48:20,990
That's right.

2331
03:48:21,350 --> 03:48:21,510
Flip.

2332
03:48:26,900 --> 03:48:27,480
Take it up.

2333
03:48:27,900 --> 03:48:29,660
There's a future.

2334
03:48:30,940 --> 03:48:32,880
There's a future.

2335
03:48:32,880 --> 03:48:32,900
There's no way.

2336
03:48:32,900 --> 03:48:33,220
No, no, no, don't.

2337
03:48:34,040 --> 03:48:36,000
Don't give up.

2338
03:48:36,000 --> 03:48:38,720
The hole in the middle of the world has the dreams.

2339
03:48:40,380 --> 03:48:47,360
It's a dream to make a dream the world can't hear any It's a
very hard thing to see.

2340
03:48:47,360 --> 03:48:55,900
The heart of your heart is a hard, It's a hard, but it's a
hard thing.

2341
03:48:55,900 --> 03:49:01,840
It doesn't work out how it can't get me, I'm always there.

2342
03:49:04,240 --> 03:49:07,180
It's not going to be like you.

2343
03:49:07,180 --> 03:49:08,800
Don't give up.

2344
03:49:10,040 --> 03:49:14,120
There's a place where there's a place.

2345
03:49:14,140 --> 03:49:41,830
I'll never get over it We are I'll be able to make it I
don't know I'll be going to go, I'll be going, I'll be I'll

2346
03:49:41,830 --> 03:49:58,630
go through the way I've got the way to make it Oh, my mind's
a cover The cover's wide, big, and big, big, big dark, dark

2347
03:49:58,630 --> 03:50:16,660
and high, but I don't have to be afraid you Ah, that's
right, yeah yeah, that's the way the world more, more and

2348
03:50:16,660 --> 03:50:23,460
more more more more more more more

2349
03:50:26,560 --> 03:50:42,700
I'm gonna be worried about even though never let me even,
even even more even more

03:50:56,320 --> 03:50:58,700
You can do it!

2351
03:51:04,700 --> 03:51:12,860
That song is all about never giving up, always believing in
yourself If you fail, you can try, try again You can cross

2352
03:51:12,860 --> 03:51:21,700
the river Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank
