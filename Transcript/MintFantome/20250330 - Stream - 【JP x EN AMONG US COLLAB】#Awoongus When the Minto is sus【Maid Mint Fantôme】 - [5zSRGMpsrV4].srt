00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,990
Do you want to look for a game?

194
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,350
Play.

195
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,110
Edgeworth.

196
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,950
Code.

197
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,890
Everyone is so cute.

198
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:33,670
Is that pizza?

199
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:34,330
Pizza?

200
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,730
It's taco.

201
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:38,130
Taco!

202
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,630
It's taco.

203
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:43,670
It's taco.

204
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,830
Tacos.

205
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,290
Tacos.

206
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,330
It looks delicious.

207
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:53,770
It looks delicious.

208
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,010
It looks delicious.

209
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,830
English or Japanese only?

210
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,050
Which one?

211
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,830
Which one?

212
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,250
English or Japanese only?

213
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:08,850
English?

214
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,390
Japanese?

215
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,050
English?

216
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,570
English.

217
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:13,650
English?

218
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:15,370
English?

219
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,090
OK.

220
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,710
Let's go with English only.

221
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,510
American English.

222
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,230
American English?

223
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,370
English.

224
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,150
American English.

225
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,030
English?

226
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:45,150
English.

227
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,750
Wait a minute.

228
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,050
English and English are prohibited?

229
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,370
I don't understand anything.

230
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,930
Whatever you are comfortable with.

231
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:04,810
The rules are...

232
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,010
When the game starts, turn off the mic.

233
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,130
When there is a meeting, turn on the mic.

234
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,830
All the rules are in the general voice chat.

235
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,550
But if there is a ghost, you can use the ghost voice chat.

236
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,570
I see.

237
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,730
From now on, we will use the general rules.

238
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:32,830
OK.

239
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,810
The general rules.

240
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,470
The general rules.

241
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,850
The general rules.

242
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,450
The rules for this one are normal among us, but just English only.

243
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,630
The language is English only.

244
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,090
English only.

245
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,930
Damn it!

246
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:14,170
I'm just a fellow crewmate.

247
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,850
Look at this thing.

248
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:20,850
What is it doing?

249
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,910
Oh my gosh.

250
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,690
I don't know how to play Among Us anymore.

251
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,710
Oh sorry.

252
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,310
My voice is kind of dead right now.

253
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,570
Hello everybody!

254
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,610
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

255
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,310
Welcome to Among Us.

256
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,570
Oh gosh.

257
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,790
I can't read it.

258
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,810
What the hell did I say?

259
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,010
Don't kill me.

260
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:48,530
Don't kill me.

261
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,990
Minto.

262
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:55,190
I'm Minto.

263
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,810
Mama is over there.

264
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,830
I'm kind of nervous because I've never collabed with a lot of these people.

265
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,330
That was fast.

266
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,430
So fast.

267
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,250
Fast.

268
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,070
So fast.

269
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:20,410
So fast.

270
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,250
What happened?

271
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,910
Who reported the body?

272
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,010
I did.

273
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,870
What happened?

274
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,190
When did you find...

275
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,690
I walked into electrical.

276
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,850
Oh yeah, I walked with you right?

277
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,210
We walked in together I think.

278
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,690
Where did you say it was?

279
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:41,950
Electrical.

280
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,010
Oh no.

281
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,190
Oh no.

282
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,750
Sounds so sus.

283
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,830
I'm innocent.

284
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,650
I don't do it.

285
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,550
This is too early to vote I think.

286
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:18,110
Let's have Shiki say her vision so we don't or will choose her as impostor.

287
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:18,490
We'll see.

288
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,310
What?

289
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:24,970
I didn't see anyone else on the left side.

290
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,750
Only in the middle or the right.

291
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,810
And the people I saw did not come from the left.

292
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:35,650
Ok, but I was with Shiki just now and she went to electrical in that short of a time.

293
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,510
I passed Ayami.

294
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,510
I'm navigator.

295
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,090
I'm too far.

296
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:58,870
I was also quite far in mid bay and I saw ETR there as well.

297
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,870
So I will back ETR up.

298
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,270
ETR safe?

299
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:03,390
Ayami safe?

300
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:06,910
I was at cafeteria.

301
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,990
Ok, Miri cafeteria.

302
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,430
I just arrived to the electrical the moment we got announcement.

303
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,030
So I was just like almost got into the electrical and then like...

304
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,930
Dead body something.

305
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,650
Not sus.

306
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:22,310
Skip?

307
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,710
Skip?

308
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:27,070
Skip for not sus.

309
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:29,590
Good job.

310
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:40,130
It's ok, it's ok.

311
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,210
Bye bye guys.

312
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,610
Ok, ok.

313
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:57,370
She should probably say that sus means suspicious.

314
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,870
Cause she's like...

315
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,250
Where is mama going?

316
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,430
I know how this looks.

317
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,490
I know how it looks.

318
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,610
I know how this looks.

319
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,290
No, no, no, no.

320
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,290
I know how this looks.

321
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:36,290
I know how this looks.

322
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,050
I went to electrical to complete my tasks.

323
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,010
I did wires.

324
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,070
I did upload.

325
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,870
I mean, was it download or download?

326
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:46,170
But either way, I was in there with Pia.

327
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:50,250
And then I got off of the download and I looked to the right.

328
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,590
And Ayami is next to Pia's dead body.

329
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,910
No, no, no, no.

330
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,090
I was not thinking.

331
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:00,370
I'm innocent.

332
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,810
I'm innocent.

333
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,950
My click just slow because I'm 100 years old.

334
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:07,870
Don't forget.

335
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,830
I'm really pure this time.

336
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:14,950
Believe me.

337
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,050
I didn't see her going to electrical.

338
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,470
No, no, no.

339
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,710
I just want...

340
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,490
No, no, no.

341
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:24,490
Please listen.

342
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,710
When I'm running to electronic...

343
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,870
When I'm running to electronic...

344
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,030
Mint follow me.

345
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,850
Mint follow me.

346
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:40,930
We only two that time.

347
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:45,550
Mint so fast and run to me.

348
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:50,110
I'm scary and I'm running to my task.

349
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,590
No, I love you.

350
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,250
That's why I chase you.

351
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,470
No, no, no.

352
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,190
You hate me.

353
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,130
Don't block me.

354
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:56,990
You always block my discord.

355
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,350
Mint sauce this time.

356
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,190
Mint sauce.

357
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,530
I'm not bite the body.

358
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,370
I'm not, I'm not.

359
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,590
I'm not really...

360
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,030
I'm innocent.

361
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:20,270
This time really I'm innocent.

362
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,210
I'm chasing my cat.

363
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:31,370
This time I'm all-in using my cat.

364
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:34,590
Really, really pure this time.

365
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:35,310
99 seconds!

366
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,550
No, no, no.

367
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,230
You die!

368
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,990
You die!

369
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,110
Bye bye!

370
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,090
Mama sayonara.

371
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,230
I love you.

372
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,570
Where do I...I need to go to navigation.

373
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,570
Oh my God, Mama's little baby.

374
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,230
Mama's little baby.

375
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,130
Mama's little baby.

376
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,490
Why are you flying?

377
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,510
I'm scared.

378
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,070
Oh, I thought it was over here.

379
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,990
I'll do wires real quick.

380
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,410
They'll handle it.

381
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,510
I believe.

382
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:26,550
See?

383
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,070
My sibling.

384
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,410
Maybe I should probably do my tasks.

385
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:36,610
I should probably...Mama's little baby.

386
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:37,810
Mama's little baby.

387
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,610
Wait, what the...

388
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,490
I was with Nana!

389
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:46,050
Oh no!

390
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:46,910
Yes!

391
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:47,770
We were together!

392
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:48,910
Oh no!

393
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,230
So...

394
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:51,810
Oh no!

395
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,370
We went to the reactor and then after I had a task with the electric.

396
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,670
And then just before going inside the electric I found the body.

397
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,910
It's always electric.

398
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:13,270
I can confirm I saw Nana Mona at the reactor, so I think that part of the story is definitely correct.

399
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:20,610
I saw Hinata-chan, Rururika-chan and Miss Milky at the reactor, so I think they're cool.

400
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,470
But I saw Koyo-chan coming from the electric.

401
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,230
I don't know, there was like...Koyo was kind of like running sussily earlier too.

402
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:30,670
What?

403
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:36,550
I was doing tasks and I was running to the reactor.

404
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,430
What is the feeling?

405
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,410
You can't...

406
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,230
Do you imagine going to the court and it's like, I have a feeling this person...

407
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:44,390
I have a feeling.

408
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:45,770
Why?

409
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:46,910
Because I have a feeling.

410
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:47,710
It's a great evidence.

411
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,250
I found the body at the same time as Mona.

412
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,650
Because they weren't there when I walked by.

413
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,950
Because I did tasks and then I was running to the reactor.

414
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,110
So it wasn't there.

415
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:58,150
Okay.

416
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,850
I was at storage, so nowhere near.

417
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:19,950
Maybe we should watch electrical a little bit, but then again, if we're saying that now, they might go somewhere else.

418
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,490
Because they weren't there when I ran by.

419
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,010
It's their favorite spot.

420
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:26,990
It's like make out point.

421
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,690
For dying.

422
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,650
I don't think I have any information enough to vote right now.

423
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,570
We have to be a little careful because I think we have a lot of people down.

424
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:48,770
It's two imposters?

425
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,010
It should be three.

426
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,230
That's a lot.

427
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,750
How many imposters are there?

428
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:02,930
There are three.

429
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,090
Three?

430
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,250
Three!

431
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,780
She's so scared!

432
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,260
She's so cute.

433
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,080
I'm cute as aggression against Nekomiya Hinata-san.

434
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,500
I'm watching.

435
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,520
I'll watch you too.

436
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,560
We watch each other.

437
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,620
We watch each other.

438
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,040
Nice, nice, nice.

439
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,820
I'm watching.

440
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:30,820
I'm watching.

441
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:31,920
I'm watching.

442
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:34,940
Oh,

443
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,300
I have to go to electrical!

444
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,500
Actually, I can go this way.

445
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:43,700
To reactor.

446
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,080
Cute aggression.

447
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,120
I've been watching Nekomiya Hinata for a very long time.

448
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,440
I haven't watched her in a bit, but I've known her for so long.

449
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,020
I'm kind of starstruck, you know.

450
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,060
She's a real OG.

451
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,500
First try.

452
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,340
Don't kill me, Shiki.

453
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,380
I thought Shiki was actually an imposter.

454
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,400
I can't trust anybody.

455
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,360
Can't trust a single soul.

456
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,080
What is this?

457
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,900
Wow, I went to electrical and I didn't die.

458
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,700
They're not really doing so much...

459
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,820
sabotage.

460
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,860
Oh!

461
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,700
I finished my tasks!

462
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,400
I'll go to the other side.

463
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,860
Unless... that's the imposter.

464
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,180
Unless...

465
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,960
I found both Nekomiya and Hinata by medbay.

466
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,360
Not next to it necessarily, but in the hallway near medbay.

467
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,500
Because, you know, there was like sabotage and then I ran that way, but...

468
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,260
I don't know.

469
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:29,920
I saw...

470
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:38,580
I saw... earlier I went to the navigation and I saw Hinata and Etora.

471
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,120
And then... I went right.

472
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,500
I saw Mio too, but that's it.

473
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,040
And then I ran away.

474
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,040
I saw Mio and I saw Etora and I saw...

475
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,340
Hinata and it was like...

476
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,740
Yeah, Mio there too in navigation and then separated.

477
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,540
So I don't know...

478
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,540
I just ran past someone and I don't know who it was.

479
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
One thing I will say...

480
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Miori I ran past several times while I was on my own and I feel like would have had ample opportunity to kill me and didn't.

481
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,020
So I think I trust Miori.

482
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,720
I was at admin trying to fix oxygen.

483
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,640
I'm a good crewmate.

484
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,020
I'm done with my tasks.

485
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,820
I am too.

486
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm almost done.

487
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,540
I have one left.

488
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,260
Yeah, I'm almost done too.

489
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,860
I live in security room.

490
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,300
I have one.

491
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,020
I think we have to vote somebody because we have...

492
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,060
Mint has been pretty quiet.

493
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,700
I don't know.

494
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,480
I know, I just said I'm done with my tasks.

495
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,740
I'm a good crewmate.

496
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,440
I was watching Mint on cameras and she had a few opportunities.

497
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,840
So maybe Mint and Mio are safe, maybe?

498
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,940
And Ettora-chan could say we dance together in front of the wires.

499
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,400
Too bad.

500
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:13,660
I know!

501
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,580
That's bad!

502
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,780
We got to vote!

503
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,500
Vote!

504
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:19,960
Vote!

505
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,480
I don't know!

506
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,380
We're screwed!

507
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,900
We're so screwed.

508
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,720
I might call the emergency meeting just to guess.

509
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,580
Alright, I don't know.

510
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,080
I don't know.

511
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,920
We have to guess.

512
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,240
Koyo.

513
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,400
I hope somebody kills me.

514
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:51,760
Stack!

515
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,700
Stack kill!

516
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,660
Stack kill!

517
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,560
Let's all get together and kill somebody...die!

518
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,260
It happened!

519
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,380
No way!

520
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,740
No!

521
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,320
Koyo!

522
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:11,360
No!

523
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,360
Koyo!

524
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,420
Himahai-san saved me because I didn't kill Hinata or Ettora.

525
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,760
And I was like, oh shoot!

526
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,380
Because one of them came in and I was like, uh oh.

527
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,620
And then Himahai saved me.

528
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,540
I was tricked!

529
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,020
Sorry!

530
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,820
Ayame was okay?

531
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,300
Yeah, Ayame was okay.

532
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,940
Ayame was innocent.

533
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm pure!

534
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,460
How did you do that?

535
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,560
How did you frame her?

536
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,040
I didn't even try framing.

537
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,900
I don't know how it happened.

538
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,800
It's just naturally...

539
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,620
Wait, I thought it was Shiki-san.

540
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,940
Because someone who killed me actually like... Shiki?

541
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,060
I think it's like...

542
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,940
Wait, weren't there three imposters?

543
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,740
Yeah, there were three.

544
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,400
Is three too much?

545
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,360
Maybe we should make it two.

546
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,480
There's 14 of us, so it's quite a lot.

547
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't know three.

548
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,820
But three is like too fast!

549
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,380
Everyone is killing everybody!

550
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Poyo-kun, serial killer.

551
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,740
Really scary.

552
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,400
I'm serial killer.

553
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,180
I didn't even hesitate to twist my neck.

554
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,520
Let's just make it three.

555
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,680
Three imposters.

556
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,060
Three first imposters.

557
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,140
This time, I'll only speak in Japanese.

558
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,980
I don't want to speak in Japanese!

559
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,200
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

560
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,700
Where is the other one?

561
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:28,860
Who?

562
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,100
Who didn't go back to their room?

563
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,260
There's one more person.

564
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm scared of Japanese!

565
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:52,440
Bye bye!

566
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,660
Impossible.

567
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,840
This is impossible.

568
00:34:59,220 --> 00:34:59,480
Wait!

569
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,200
This is so impossible.

570
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,400
No way!

571
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,640
No way!

572
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,240
No way!

573
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,240
No way!

574
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,040
No way!

575
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,800
No way!

576
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,700
No way!

577
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,820
I don't want to do it!

578
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,860
I'll try to kill.

579
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,380
Oh, it's here.

580
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,020
Where?

581
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,920
Where?

582
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,180
Where?

583
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,880
Hina-chan, where is this?

584
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,340
Under the toilet.

585
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,860
Under the toilet.

586
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,160
But...

587
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,120
No...

588
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,940
No...

589
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,920
Aoi!

590
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,420
Aoi?

591
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,740
Yume Kaito was in the toilet.

592
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,000
Where was Yume Kaito?

593
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,340
In the toilet.

594
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,960
There were several people in the toilet.

595
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,900
Shiki was there, right?

596
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,800
When was I in the toilet?

597
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,020
I wonder if I was in the toilet.

598
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,060
Ayami and I were in the toilet, right?

599
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:44,280
So I went down from the toilet to the storage room.

600
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,500
And I found it.

601
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,140
But I think I passed by in the hallway.

602
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,000
I don't think so.

603
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,780
I don't think so.

604
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:05,200
After the card was slashed, I was looking at the map to see where I was.

605
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,980
I went to the hallway, but I didn't go up or down.

606
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:16,520
I thought I was in the blue room, but I didn't go down.

607
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:20,280
So you were in the hallway and you saw me?

608
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,180
Yes.

609
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,680
I remember that there were three people passing by.

610
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,160
Maybe one of them was Ayami.

611
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,700
Yes.

612
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,880
I didn't go down, so I don't think anyone came from below.

613
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,180
The one who was close to me was...

614
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,880
I think so.

615
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
I think so too.

616
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,600
I think it's a little suspicious.

617
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,100
I think it's a little suspicious.

618
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,300
Let's do our best!

619
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,520
Let's do our best!

620
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,620
Let's do our best!

621
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,080
Guys, I'm not saying anything because...what do I need to say?

622
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,300
What do I need to say?

623
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,780
Otherwise, they'll be like...

624
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,300
They'll be like...

625
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,840
Also, I don't have confidence in my Japanese.

626
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:36,720
I have no confidence in my Japanese at all, baby.

627
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,480
So...

628
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,240
Electrical.

629
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,580
Good thing I didn't kill you.

630
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,300
Oh!

631
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,260
Mama!

632
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,780
Mama!

633
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,620
Well...

634
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:24,580
We didn't pass by each other, but...

635
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,320
I don't think anything was different.

636
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,220
I was behind you.

637
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,960
Yes, I saw you behind me.

638
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,060
Yes.

639
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,780
I don't know the rest.

640
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,020
I don't know.

641
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,420
I don't know.

642
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,000
What I'm curious about is...

643
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,920
Didn't Ayami say she was going to meet you?

644
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,580
And then she was killed, right?

645
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,380
That's right.

646
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,860
Rikubo is suspicious.

647
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,160
Rikubo was in O2.

648
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,240
She was passing by me.

649
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,320
Also, was Miori there?

650
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,160
We passed by each other on the 5th floor.

651
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,520
Who was the one who fixed the reactor?

652
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,420
I was in the reactor.

653
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,220
Lulun, Himahai, and me.

654
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,420
The three of us were together for a long time.

655
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,480
I don't think I can kill you.

656
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,580
I was with Kahel once.

657
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,760
The four of us were safe.

658
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,040
What do you mean?

659
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,800
What do you mean?

660
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,340
I don't know.

661
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:44,160
I uploaded it to the admin room.

662
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,100
After I uploaded it, I went through the stairs.

663
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:56,660
When I tried to go to the right, the door closed.

664
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,720
I was found at that moment.

665
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,700
Is Mint suspicious?

666
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,000
I wonder if it's possible to kill Ayami-san.

667
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,960
Don't go that far!

668
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,640
I love Mama.

669
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,900
There is no way I can kill her.

670
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,740
I love Mama.

671
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,880
I didn't kill her.

672
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,540
There is no way I can kill her this time.

673
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,440
OK, electrical.

674
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,510
Maybe she wanted me to follow her.

675
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,250
Oh my god!

676
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:43,430
Mama's little baby!

677
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,630
Get Mama's little baby.

678
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,970
Mama's little baby.

679
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,330
I pretended.

680
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,590
I can't kill.

681
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,690
Right here.

682
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:01,210
We can double kill.

683
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,610
However many kill.

684
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:14,810
Let's double kill.

685
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:15,550
Double kill.

686
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,770
Let's double kill.

687
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:17,570
Double kill.

688
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,790
Let's double kill.

689
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,290
Kill!

690
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:29,770
Kill!

691
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:30,110
Kill!

692
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:33,510
Do you think they saw?

693
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:38,710
Oh shit!

694
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,050
I thought I was the wrong person.

695
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:40,950
Time to kill.

696
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,370
Kill!

697
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:44,750
Kill!

698
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,150
Kill!

699
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:55,430
I saw it!

700
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,050
I saw it!

701
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:57,850
I saw it!

702
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:58,090
Who?

703
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,290
Who?

704
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:03,010
I saw Mito-san coming out of the vent.

705
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,210
I saw Mito -san coming out of the vent.

706
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:13,250
I saw Mito-san coming out of the vent.

707
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,950
I saw it.

708
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,590
It was light blue.

709
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,470
It was light blue.

710
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,710
I was found out.

711
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:29,290
You were found out.

712
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:29,810
You were found out.

713
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,750
You were found out.

714
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,730
It looks so warm in there.

715
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,270
That's right.

716
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,490
Yes, it was me.

717
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,710
Everyone do your best!

718
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,190
Bye bye!

719
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:09,230
We can go to the ghost now.

720
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:12,170
Welcome!

721
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:15,330
3, 2, 1...

722
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:15,890
Welcome!

723
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,730
No yeah you!

724
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,810
How dare you!

725
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,370
I knew it!

726
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:28,570
I knew it!

727
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,970
Sorry!

728
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:32,210
How did you die?

729
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:32,910
Huh?

730
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,950
How did you die Koyo?

731
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:35,930
Bad girl!

732
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,130
Nunu ripped my neck off.

733
00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:40,170
We were double kill.

734
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:42,030
Yeah, double kill.

735
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:42,350
Thanks!

736
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,410
Everytime I was like...

737
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,790
Ok, I trust this person.

738
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,350
They killed me the next second!

739
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,850
I do not trust anyone in this game.

740
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:00,830
Who is the other one?

741
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,290
Should I say?

742
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:07,010
Do you want me to say?

743
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,650
Yeah, we want to know.

744
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,350
It's Narin and Nanamona.

745
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:13,610
Ok.

746
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,090
I messed up.

747
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:22,250
You know, I personal know.

748
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,930
If I got into an impostor, I will kill you both.

749
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,170
Three of you, I will kill all of you.

750
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:32,050
Now we know what will happen when they die.

751
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:32,790
No, no, no!

752
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,530
I'm just joking!

753
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,250
Now we know.

754
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:37,450
No, I'm so sorry!

755
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,530
I don't think I'm gonna be an impostor soon.

756
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:42,050
I'm just a crewmate.

757
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:51,410
Yeah, I looked at the wrong color and I went out the vent and I said oops.

758
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:56,430
It's so funny.

759
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:57,470
It's an accident.

760
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,630
You got caught red-handed.

761
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:05,410
Everyone was like...

762
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,970
It's Mito!

763
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:07,610
It's Mito!

764
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,990
Oopsie.

765
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,810
Everyone voted you out.

766
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,550
It's midnight for me.

767
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:15,370
I'm sleepy.

768
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,210
Oh really?

769
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,670
It's morning for me.

770
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:19,230
I'm sleepy.

771
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,150
It's morning.

772
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,070
It's actually not morning anymore.

773
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,450
It's like 11 in the morning.

774
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:33,690
I woke up early because I was scared I might wake up too late.

775
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:37,550
So I was like I have to wake up early before the collapse.

776
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,390
You're here.

777
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,890
You made it.

778
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,170
Let's see.

779
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:52,030
Mama.

780
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,110
Mito-chan.

781
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:54,490
Mito-chan.

782
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:57,070
I asked Ayami Mama.

783
00:46:57,470 --> 00:46:58,790
Ayami Mama, do you like Oppai?

784
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,790
He said it.

785
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:04,950
And then I asked why Mito doesn't have Oppai.

786
00:47:11,890 --> 00:47:12,890
Miori-chan?

787
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,090
Love all sizes.

788
00:47:16,490 --> 00:47:17,090
Miori?

789
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:17,890
Miori-chan!

790
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,920
What happened?

791
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:48,920
It's over.

792
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,120
Me too.

793
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,780
Why Miori-chan?

794
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,100
I don't know.

795
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,640
I don't know.

796
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,360
You are too soft.

797
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:11,220
I want to look at the impostor.

798
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:12,100
What will they do?

799
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,540
I will look at someone.

800
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,720
Do you know who is the impostor?

801
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:24,780
Ruru and Nanamona.

802
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,360
Let's see.

803
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,400
Ruru is amazing.

804
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,360
Pro impostor.

805
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,140
That's right.

806
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,880
Very good.

807
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,180
How many impostors are left?

808
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:43,520
Kill!

809
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:43,820
Kill!

810
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:44,680
Kill!

811
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,080
We can win!

812
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:47,220
We can win!

813
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,580
That's not anymore!

814
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,160
Do it!

815
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:54,660
Do it!

816
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:55,820
No!

817
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:58,520
Do task!

818
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,580
I want to see Sloth!

819
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,040
Let's go!

820
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,260
I want to see the process of killing!

821
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:06,900
Kill!

822
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,180
Kill!

823
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:07,580
Kill!

824
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:10,840
Why are you killing?

825
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:12,520
I need bloodshed!

826
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:15,580
OK,

827
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,180
no one is left.

828
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,980
That's a good sign.

829
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,180
Let's go!

830
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,420
Do task!

831
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:29,760
Yes!

832
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,080
Yes!

833
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,140
Please change!

834
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,920
5 seconds left.

835
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:38,120
A little more.

836
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:38,840
Oh is it?

837
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:40,840
It's very short.

838
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,640
The one with the longest voting time.

839
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:47,900
That's right.

840
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:51,940
Task...

841
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:53,440
Someone...

842
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,660
If we do a little more it will end.

843
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,440
I think it will end.

844
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,820
I have one left.

845
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
I did the task.

846
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,640
It's over.

847
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:06,920
It's over.

848
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,980
Is the last one Koyo?

849
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,000
Koyo...

850
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,220
Let's do our best!

851
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,120
Let's do our best!

852
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,560
Please do your best!

853
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,440
Oh my god!

854
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,400
I have a good feeling.

855
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,660
One second guys, I'll change the...

856
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,140
The chat so that it is...

857
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:48,580
Since I'm in the ghost chat, I'll make a ghost chat and I'll make a live chat.

858
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,120
So give me one second.

859
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,020
Browser...

860
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,800
It's so quiet when we can't hear their voices.

861
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,160
I know right!

862
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,080
One second, one second.

863
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:01,860
I gotta get the same...

864
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,800
Me too, me too.

865
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:03,920
I want to know.

866
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,120
Someone voted on...

867
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:09,620
Do your best!

868
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,980
Purgatory is almost over.

869
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:12,680
One second.

870
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,440
Sorry guys.

871
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,620
Please, please, please.

872
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:15,660
Do your best!

873
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:16,480
Who is it?

874
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:16,520
Who is it?

875
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,460
Who is it?

876
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,680
There we go.

877
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:23,660
So that's...

878
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,840
It seems that Nanachi hasn't voted yet.

879
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,520
And the live.

880
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,520
I'll switch.

881
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,180
That should be suspicious enough.

882
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,920
It's the only one who hasn't voted yet!

883
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,120
I must have it.

884
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,420
No!

885
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,300
OK, I'll do my task.

886
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:50,380
Hopefully I'm the last one.

887
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,780
Wait, wait, wait.

888
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,400
Koyo, Koyo, I have an idea.

889
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:54,620
Don't do your task.

890
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:55,700
What?

891
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:56,460
What?

892
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:57,020
Huh?

893
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,180
She's the impostor!

894
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:01,720
Why are you the impostor?

895
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,420
What are you doing?

896
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,480
I have an idea.

897
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,760
Kill, kill, kill!

898
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,940
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

899
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,260
Oh my gosh!

900
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:24,180
I think we should do the task.

901
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,960
I'm glad!

902
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:32,580
Wow!

903
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,320
Back to other chat.

904
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:08,560
When we gathered, when the door was closed, two impostors were split up.

905
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:09,560
It was really bad.

906
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,780
I couldn't do anything.

907
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:14,360
There were only impostors here.

908
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,220
I couldn't do anything.

909
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,080
Mint-chan, I'm sorry.

910
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,740
I should have done it when I found you, but I was surprised.

911
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,380
I made a mistake!

912
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,260
I'm so happy!

913
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,200
I understand!

914
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:33,320
Who was the impostor?

915
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:45,580
The impostor was Mint-san, and Luna-san, and Ruron-chan.

916
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:49,360
Mint-chan!

917
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,960
Mint-chan like broke my neck.

918
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,800
The moment I saw her I was like...

919
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,660
I don't know anything.

920
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:11,020
I'll make another game for Hide and Seek.

921
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,380
How to leave...

922
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:24,640
I have never played Hide and Seek.

923
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,480
It's fun!

924
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:27,540
I have never played it.

925
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,680
I have never played it either.

926
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,300
The rules are written in the middle, right?

927
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,420
Hide and Seek.

928
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,160
Hide and Seek is written here.

929
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:38,660
What?

930
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,200
Wow!

931
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,980
Wow!

932
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,500
Maybe you should make a new room.

933
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,680
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

934
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,160
This was so fast!

935
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,240
That was the room code, you guys.

936
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:17,480
Looper Egg.

937
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,940
Looper Egg.

938
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:20,620
Ok, ok.

939
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:37,680
Ok.

940
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,460
Why are you so fast?

941
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,380
Hide and Seek, Hide and Seek.

942
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,300
Oh my god, I'm so bad at that.

943
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,440
You have to restart the game.

944
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,560
So, we'll be split up into two teams.

945
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,560
Team Nihongo Japanese and Team English Eigo.

946
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,000
Nanamona speaks multiple languages, but I put you on Team Japanese because it fills the 7-7.

947
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,120
Nanamona is like, which one?

948
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:27,780
Which team?

949
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:35,340
So, Team Japanese language is Nanamona.

950
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:42,780
Hinata-san, Rurun-san, Ayami-san, Hikumu-san, Etra-san, and Shimahai-san.

951
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:51,100
Team English is Koyo, Mint, Milky, Pia, Miyo, Kaheru, and Shiki.

952
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,820
Oh my god.

953
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,740
The rule is...

954
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,220
It's ok.

955
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,340
The rule is split into two teams.

956
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,920
So, how this works is...

957
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,200
Because we cannot choose impostors, we'll restart the room.

958
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:08,840
Oh wait, no, I lied.

959
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,580
I'm reading the wrong rule.

960
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,880
That's for the other game if we have time.

961
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,520
Ok, wait, ok.

962
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,720
So, we'll do... so it's random.

963
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:23,540
So, hopefully we'll go to EN first or JP first and just enter EN or then JP.

964
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,860
But we'll work that out, so don't worry about that.

965
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,840
So, mic on the whole time.

966
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,620
So, during the game, mic on.

967
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,840
Also, you can give a hint to your teammates like...

968
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,480
Impostor...

969
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,720
The other team members are over there.

970
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,260
You can give a hint to that too.

971
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,840
So, if you see one and say like...

972
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,220
Oh, to help your team out, to find the person, you can be like...

973
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,840
Oh, this person is near somewhere that has...

974
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,960
Not say the room, but you can hint it.

975
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,640
Not say the room, but you can hint it.

976
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,320
Like, close, close.

977
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,340
Hot, cold, hot, cold.

978
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,400
That's good too.

979
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,000
So, this is...

980
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,160
So, first to two.

981
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,780
And then, one kill.

982
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,960
One kill is 0.5 points.

983
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:23,740
0.5 points.

984
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:24,580
Kill.

985
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,360
But...

986
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,920
If you kill your own team member...

987
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,440
Minus.

988
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:32,920
Minus 0.5 points.

989
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:35,400
You have to be careful.

990
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,680
I see, I see.

991
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,360
So, even if you find them, you can't kill them.

992
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,380
You have to be careful.

993
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:46,100
Wow, you have to be careful.

994
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,000
Japanese team...

995
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,220
I don't know.

996
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,920
It's a dark color.

997
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,680
If you...

998
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,260
Then, after the game, we'll check who completed their tasks.

999
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:00,520
And then...

1000
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,640
The most completed task of like the members who complete all tasks.

1001
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,640
We're not counting each individual tasks, but the member who completed all the tasks.

1002
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,220
Then, we'll count that up and...

1003
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:15,700
No...

1004
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,080
Ah, I see.

1005
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:28,060
I don't know how to explain that in Japanese, but...

1006
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,800
Mona-chan, can you help with the one point?

1007
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:37,860
Mona-chan, can you help with the one point?

1008
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,600
So, actually, if it's all members, it'll be one point.

1009
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,260
So, if all members complete all tasks, yeah.

1010
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:51,720
That'd be everybody.

1011
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,200
I'm scared.

1012
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,380
Wait, which team?

1013
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,720
So, what should we do now?

1014
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,740
Should we do English only?

1015
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,320
English only?

1016
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:13,200
English only.

1017
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:13,680
English only?

1018
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:13,920
Only English?

1019
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,160
Only English?

1020
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,080
Only English.

1021
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:17,320
English only!

1022
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,100
It's gonna be very scary.

1023
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,180
I'm a little scared.

1024
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,960
Alright, so that's A, B team and then Poster.

1025
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:24,340
So, then B is A, B team.

1026
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,240
Oh my gosh.

1027
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:25,960
This is amazing.

1028
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,280
Task, task.

1029
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,240
That's fast.

1030
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:29,700
Task, task.

1031
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:30,640
What is this?

1032
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,180
Oh, Kai.

1033
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,560
Help me!

1034
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,860
Task, task, task.

1035
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:36,560
Alright.

1036
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:37,340
Where are my...

1037
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,100
I'm lost.

1038
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,800
Where are...

1039
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,020
I'm stuck.

1040
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,720
What should I do?

1041
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,120
It's too scary.

1042
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,460
It's too scary.

1043
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:54,340
It's too scary.

1044
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,360
I don't like this.

1045
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:55,880
No, no, no.

1046
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,240
Oh my God.

1047
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,360
What should I do?

1048
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,380
What am I supposed to do?

1049
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,240
I can't read.

1050
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:08,360
I am illiterate.

1051
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:09,080
Oh no.

1052
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,700
Where is it?

1053
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,900
No, no, no.

1054
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,420
Someone is there.

1055
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:34,840
Don't touch me.

1056
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,440
Don't kill me.

1057
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,960
Don't kill me.

1058
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:40,540
Careful, guys.

1059
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,060
Don't kill me.

1060
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,620
For you.

1061
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:44,120
For you, don't kill me.

1062
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:45,500
Let's go that way.

1063
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,160
Careful.

1064
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:47,880
He's running.

1065
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,960
Open up.

1066
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,060
He got no one.

1067
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:56,820
He got no one.

1068
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,100
No one is inside.

1069
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,160
What is this?

1070
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,780
What should I do?

1071
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:03,420
What should I do?

1072
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,900
There is more.

1073
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:05,900
Oh no, no, no.

1074
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:08,660
Mito-chan!

1075
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:09,520
Careful!

1076
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:10,300
Mito-chan!

1077
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,720
Mito-chan!

1078
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,550
I don't like this.

1079
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:24,290
I don't like this.

1080
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:24,990
I don't like this.

1081
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,030
Mito-chan!

1082
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:40,350
Please don't do that.

1083
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:41,090
Please don't do that.

1084
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:41,970
Please don't do that.

1085
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:42,910
What happened?

1086
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:43,170
What happened?

1087
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,090
I don't like this.

1088
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,870
I'm scared.

1089
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,330
I'm scared.

1090
01:03:06,050 --> 01:03:06,190
I'm scared.

1091
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:15,110
I don't like this.

1092
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:20,970
Again, again.

1093
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,750
I don't like this.

1094
01:03:22,750 --> 01:03:23,250
I don't like this.

1095
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:25,990
I don't like this.

1096
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,470
Wrong member.

1097
01:03:31,030 --> 01:03:31,790
One more second.

1098
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:32,770
One more second.

1099
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,130
I don't like this.

1100
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:35,690
I don't like this.

1101
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:42,370
That was so scary.

1102
01:03:44,890 --> 01:03:46,150
That was so scary.

1103
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:48,730
How many did you kill?

1104
01:03:49,970 --> 01:03:51,230
How many points did you get?

1105
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:51,830
How many?

1106
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,130
How many points did you get?

1107
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,130
The person who was killed...

1108
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:59,630
Pia and Ayami-chan.

1109
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,450
I...

1110
01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:02,250
Ayami...

1111
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,070
I'm sorry.

1112
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:05,670
Me too?

1113
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:08,110
I'm sorry.

1114
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:09,110
I'm sorry.

1115
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:12,570
Me too.

1116
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:15,130
So it was Ayami and...

1117
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:16,490
Pia.

1118
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:17,350
Miss you.

1119
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:18,130
Miss you.

1120
01:04:18,210 --> 01:04:18,710
Miss you.

1121
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:19,510
Miss you.

1122
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:21,810
Thank you.

1123
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:22,510
Why?

1124
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:22,930
What happened?

1125
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,630
Wait, I turned orange too.

1126
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:28,170
Why?

1127
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:33,830
I thought it was Kaheru.

1128
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:35,050
Because it's orange.

1129
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,330
I love red.

1130
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:40,070
Kaheru is red.

1131
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:40,710
Why?

1132
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,230
Why did you change your color?

1133
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:43,910
Wait a moment.

1134
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:44,710
Let's add points.

1135
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:48,110
How many?

1136
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:48,810
Who?

1137
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:50,150
How did you change?

1138
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,810
It was an impostor.

1139
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,570
Who was killed?

1140
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,170
Ayami.

1141
01:04:58,210 --> 01:04:59,630
Ayami and Pia.

1142
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:02,550
If only two people were killed, I would have killed them.

1143
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:03,450
I see.

1144
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:05,510
Ok, ok.

1145
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:06,290
This one.

1146
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:07,270
Your teammates?

1147
01:05:08,110 --> 01:05:11,510
I killed my teammates and enemies one by one.

1148
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:17,190
How many points?

1149
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:19,370
Zero points.

1150
01:05:19,370 --> 01:05:20,030
I see.

1151
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:24,090
Ok,

1152
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:27,510
next.

1153
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:28,030
We got this.

1154
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,090
We can win this.

1155
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:35,010
If it's not in English, let's do it again.

1156
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:39,110
If it's not in English, let's do it again.

1157
01:05:44,770 --> 01:05:48,430
So the killer for this one is not English.

1158
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:50,210
Then we will reset it.

1159
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,630
How is it gonna be?

1160
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:55,870
Who is it?

1161
01:05:56,610 --> 01:05:59,170
I will do my best.

1162
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:00,770
Reset it.

1163
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:01,010
Reset it.

1164
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:02,070
Ok.

1165
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,410
Is it already dead?

1166
01:06:06,090 --> 01:06:07,270
Reset it.

1167
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:07,930
Let's go back.

1168
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:08,350
Ok.

1169
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:15,650
I was killed.

1170
01:06:18,770 --> 01:06:19,870
She was killed.

1171
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:20,290
I was killed.

1172
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:26,220
I don't know if Misaki will survive or not, but...

1173
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:31,250
Let's see how it goes.

1174
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:34,730
The plan might change.

1175
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:38,310
Thank you.

1176
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,250
No problem.

1177
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:40,210
Thank you.

1178
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:41,030
Thank you.

1179
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,090
I think we can only play one more game.

1180
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:45,710
Yes.

1181
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:45,830
Yes.

1182
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:48,870
Please do your best.

1183
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,390
I'm sorry.

1184
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:50,010
Please do your best.

1185
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,390
Are you ready?

1186
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,310
I'm sorry.

1187
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:02,950
I'm sorry.

1188
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:04,130
I will make a new room.

1189
01:07:10,410 --> 01:07:11,530
Kill me.

1190
01:07:11,650 --> 01:07:11,830
Kill me.

1191
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:12,510
Kill me.

1192
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,150
Kill me.

1193
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:13,790
Kill me.

1194
01:07:13,950 --> 01:07:13,950
Kill me.

1195
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:14,710
Kill me.

1196
01:07:15,830 --> 01:07:16,810
I'm sorry.

1197
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:20,690
Yeah!

1198
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:25,790
Ok.

1199
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:34,670
We are back to blue.

1200
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:35,650
That's true.

1201
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:36,310
That's amazing.

1202
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:37,510
That's true.

1203
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:38,550
I went back to black earlier.

1204
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:41,610
I don't remember if I was black or not.

1205
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:41,930
I don't remember.

1206
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:44,630
I was black.

1207
01:07:45,590 --> 01:07:46,530
I don't remember if I was black or not.

1208
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:48,830
One more person.

1209
01:07:51,350 --> 01:07:56,370
If we have to restart the game, why don't we just let the impostor kill everyone so it ends?

1210
01:07:56,790 --> 01:07:57,550
You are right.

1211
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,750
Let's kill her too.

1212
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:08,350
Can someone... If someone like impostor don't kill me, I want to leave it just one time because I got killed.

1213
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,230
Please don't kill me!

1214
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,290
It's impossible!

1215
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:18,470
Nice!

1216
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,690
Nihongo!

1217
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:25,990
Nihongo!

1218
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,030
Nihongo!

1219
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:27,790
Nihongo!

1220
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:34,530
I will do my task properly!

1221
01:08:35,450 --> 01:08:36,210
What is this?

1222
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:38,550
I'm scared.

1223
01:08:39,510 --> 01:08:40,190
I'm scared.

1224
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:40,390
I'm scared.

1225
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:41,090
What is this?

1226
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:42,310
How do I find it?

1227
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:45,150
Nihongo team's member Misato...

1228
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,450
You can give hints to Miyo-chan.

1229
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:49,410
Over here!

1230
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:51,320
No, no, no, no, no.

1231
01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:52,130
There is no task.

1232
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,350
Oh, Nanamona is...

1233
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:55,550
What?

1234
01:08:56,050 --> 01:08:58,570
No, no, no, no.

1235
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,210
Nanamona is not there.

1236
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,050
Nanamona is...

1237
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:02,590
What is this?

1238
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:04,570
Where?

1239
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:05,570
Where?

1240
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,650
Nanamona is not bad.

1241
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:06,870
I can't find it.

1242
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:09,410
What is this?

1243
01:09:10,330 --> 01:09:10,330
What is this?

1244
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:10,450
What is this?

1245
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,430
What are you doing?

1246
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:12,850
What are you doing?

1247
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:15,350
What are you doing?

1248
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:17,070
Where is this?

1249
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,770
Who is this?

1250
01:09:22,090 --> 01:09:22,810
It's Koya-chan!

1251
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:23,470
Koya-chan!

1252
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:24,390
Koya-chan!

1253
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:25,150
It's close.

1254
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:30,810
Ah, this is it.

1255
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:33,510
I don't like this.

1256
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:34,490
Where?

1257
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:35,170
Where?

1258
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:35,390
Where?

1259
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:42,360
It's close.

1260
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:45,500
Again!

1261
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:57,680
The task is over.

1262
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:00,980
It's me!

1263
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:01,520
Over here!

1264
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:02,340
Over here!

1265
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:04,000
It's fast.

1266
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,580
The task is over.

1267
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,220
The task is over.

1268
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,180
Ayame, you can do it!

1269
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:08,920
Over here!

1270
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:09,800
Over here!

1271
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:10,240
Over here!

1272
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:10,900
What is this?

1273
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:13,760
Nanamona is...

1274
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:14,980
Over here!

1275
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,260
Over here!

1276
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:23,100
It's over!

1277
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:24,320
It's over!

1278
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,260
Let's go!

1279
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,600
It's over!

1280
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:29,480
Stop it!

1281
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:30,460
It's over!

1282
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:31,940
It's over!

1283
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:36,120
Stop it!

1284
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:36,520
Stop it!

1285
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,140
What are you doing?

1286
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:39,440
What are you doing?

1287
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:42,140
Oh no!

1288
01:10:44,060 --> 01:10:45,460
Oh no!

1289
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:48,400
Why?

1290
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,940
Stop it!

1291
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:57,800
Stop it!

1292
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:58,280
Stop it!

1293
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:58,520
Stop it!

1294
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,040
Stop it!

1295
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:09,920
Stop it!

1296
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,180
Stop it!

1297
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:16,980
Nice!

1298
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:17,340
Nice!

1299
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:19,760
Isn't it good?

1300
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:22,920
It's over.

1301
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,770
Isn't it good?

1302
01:11:30,770 --> 01:11:30,930
Isn't it good?

1303
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:37,190
Why?

1304
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:49,390
Why did you kill me?

1305
01:11:49,590 --> 01:11:50,810
I'm sorry.

1306
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:55,130
I thought we were friends!

1307
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:55,870
I'm sorry.

1308
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:07,630
Actually, it was too fast.

1309
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:14,630
Ayame, Pia...

1310
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:16,810
Ayame, Rikumu-san...

1311
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:19,830
Ayame, Rikumu-san and...

1312
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:20,270
Pia.

1313
01:12:25,650 --> 01:12:30,550
I give the Japanese language team 0 points...

1314
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:31,210
and...

1315
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:32,770
0.5!

1316
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,330
We win!

1317
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:44,250
Even though I died every time, it's ok!

1318
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,850
We won!

1319
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:46,330
The next game is...

1320
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,110
Let's change the name.

1321
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:51,810
The name?

1322
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,270
How?

1323
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:55,410
Let's make a new room...

1324
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:57,050
Anything is ok?

1325
01:12:57,990 --> 01:12:59,450
I'll send it to you.

1326
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:01,750
Where should we change the name?

1327
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:03,450
In the game?

1328
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,290
We can't do it without the Maya account.

1329
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:07,870
We can change the name in the Maya account.

1330
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:14,270
I see.

1331
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:16,630
I see.

1332
01:13:19,330 --> 01:13:21,970
I see.

1333
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:24,710
The list of names...

1334
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:27,170
1, 2, 3, 4.

1335
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:27,470
Ok.

1336
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:37,990
The rule is a regular rule.

1337
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:42,170
But, you have to just change your name...

1338
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:45,810
and you can only refer people to their new name.

1339
01:13:46,770 --> 01:13:48,170
You can't be like...

1340
01:13:50,090 --> 01:13:54,130
Try not to use the color as the replacement for the name.

1341
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:54,850
Just say the name.

1342
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:04,650
Isn't the name that everyone has to change to in the chat?

1343
01:14:04,750 --> 01:14:06,830
So please check the chart.

1344
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:07,490
Ok.

1345
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:08,550
Oh no.

1346
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:09,070
I change.

1347
01:14:15,810 --> 01:14:16,650
Let's change the name.

1348
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,010
I see.

1349
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:25,390
I made a mistake.

1350
01:14:26,970 --> 01:14:27,990
I finished the game.

1351
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,890
I turned off the game.

1352
01:14:33,610 --> 01:14:37,750
I want to do this.

1353
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:39,810
Why?

1354
01:14:42,990 --> 01:14:43,690
You.

1355
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,810
Why you?

1356
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:46,310
You.

1357
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:47,410
Don't use this name.

1358
01:14:48,410 --> 01:14:48,990
You.

1359
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,310
You is hard.

1360
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:51,450
Ok,

1361
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:57,190
ok.

1362
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:03,450
What does this mean?

1363
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:09,070
You.

1364
01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:12,260
You.

1365
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:14,330
You.

1366
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:14,870
You.

1367
01:15:15,530 --> 01:15:16,230
Thank you.

1368
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:17,230
I see.

1369
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:19,590
I see.

1370
01:15:19,590 --> 01:15:21,270
So you can just spell the name out.

1371
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,730
You can say it like...

1372
01:15:23,730 --> 01:15:25,230
You, or like...

1373
01:15:25,570 --> 01:15:26,170
Or like, you know.

1374
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:28,490
You.

1375
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:30,590
You!

1376
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:32,030
It's you.

1377
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:32,450
You.

1378
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:32,970
You!

1379
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:37,590
Everyone is you.

1380
01:15:38,530 --> 01:15:39,030
Yeah!

1381
01:15:40,230 --> 01:15:41,190
Thank you.

1382
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:43,370
Thank you.

1383
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,230
Thank you.

1384
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:44,930
Thank you.

1385
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:45,470
Thank you.

1386
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,170
I'm gonna join you.

1387
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:51,650
Oh my god!

1388
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,930
You and you and you and you and you.

01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:01,530

You two.

1391
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:03,970
Oh my god!

1392
01:16:05,930 --> 01:16:06,870
Who are you?

1393
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:08,190
We are you.

1394
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:09,090
We are all you.

1395
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:11,810
So many.

1396
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:14,210
It's you.

1397
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:14,750
You...

1398
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,830
It's you!

1399
01:16:17,010 --> 01:16:17,770
It's you!

1400
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,470
It's you!

1401
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:20,190
It's you!

1402
01:16:20,190 --> 01:16:20,210
It's who?

1403
01:16:20,570 --> 01:16:21,290
It's who?

1404
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:21,950
It's you!

1405
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:23,410
Let's do it.

1406
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,730
Bye bye.

1407
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:29,430
Bye bye.

1408
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:30,830
Bye bye.

1409
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,490
Who said that?

1410
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:36,050
Oh we are in a new place now.

1411
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:37,440
I'm...

1412
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:39,090
You...

1413
01:16:39,090 --> 01:16:39,470
One.

1414
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:40,890
Everybody.

1415
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:43,230
Now you can refer to me as my proper name.

1416
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:45,130
You...

1417
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:45,710
It's you.

1418
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:47,310
You...

1419
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,150
It's you.

1420
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:50,130
Hey you!

1421
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:51,790
Like you.

1422
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:52,550
No, you.

1423
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:54,810
Wait, where am I going?

1424
01:16:57,010 --> 01:17:00,070
I haven't played Among Us in so long you guys.

1425
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,710
Wait, is it...

1426
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:01,930
Here?

1427
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:06,680
I thought...

1428
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:07,320
Did they get rid of...

1429
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,420
Having to get rid of the...

1430
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:09,080
What's it called?

1431
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:11,080
The...

1432
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:13,300
You first had to always get rid of the...

1433
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,300
What's it called first?

1434
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:17,520
No?

1435
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,680
The screws!

1436
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,200
You!

1437
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,800
You!

1438
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:25,680
You!

1439
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:28,760
You!

1440
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:29,440
You!

1441
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:29,680
You!

1442
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:29,740
You!

1443
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,300
Who did that?

1444
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:32,980
You!

1445
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:38,520
So I saw you on cafeteria.

1446
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:40,820
Only one body.

1447
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:48,580
I came from medbay.

1448
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:49,540
I came from medbay.

1449
01:17:49,780 --> 01:17:53,120
I went to the cafeteria.

1450
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:54,600
And then I saw you!

1451
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,060
You!

1452
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,140
You!

1453
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:04,700
You!

1454
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:04,940
You!

1455
01:18:04,940 --> 01:18:05,240
You!

1456
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:05,560
You!

1457
01:18:05,680 --> 01:18:05,840
You!

1458
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,860
I'm here by locker room with you.

1459
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:12,360
You!

1460
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,920
You!

1461
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:19,100
Oh...

1462
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,720
I saw...

1463
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,680
I saw...

1464
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:22,780
Who...

1465
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,560
In cafeteria when...

1466
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:26,900
They were with the body.

1467
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:27,920
Wait, who?

1468
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:28,880
Who?

1469
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,520
In cafeteria...

1470
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,380
How do you...

1471
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:38,600
You!

1472
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,060
Next to the body.

1473
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:43,500
Who!

1474
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,500
Not who, but who...

1475
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,800
I saw.

1476
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:48,500
Who?

1477
01:18:48,820 --> 01:18:49,060
Who?

1478
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,660
Who?

1479
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,020
Suspicious.

1480
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,320
I see.

1481
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:01,360
Suspicious.

1482
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:02,460
Suspicious.

1483
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:04,960
Suspicious.

1484
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:05,160
Suspicious.

1485
01:19:06,740 --> 01:19:08,580
It's who...

1486
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:10,200
Who did it?

1487
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:11,640
Who did it?

1488
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:12,900
Who did it?

1489
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:13,800
Who?

1490
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:14,600
Who?

1491
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:15,020
Who?

1492
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:19,840
Who is sus?

1493
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,100
Who is sus?

1494
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:25,980
Who is sus?

1495
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:26,380
OK

1496
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,240
Bye bye!

1497
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:43,980
Bye bye!

1498
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,980
Let's see what we got.

1499
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:48,720
Nothing over here.

1500
01:19:56,380 --> 01:19:59,740
I'm so used to being so fast and hide and seek.

1501
01:20:00,700 --> 01:20:02,660
I don't feel...I feel so slow now.

1502
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,640
Guys, I'm trying so hard not to make a Metal Gear joke.

1503
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:08,600
Everytime they are like...

1504
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:08,820
Who?

1505
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,880
Oh my gosh.

1506
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:16,480
Such a lust for revenge.

1507
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:22,820
It's so hard not to make a Metal Gear joke.

1508
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:23,650
Oh, we are with...

1509
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:24,460
You.

1510
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,940
Please, nothing happens so that I can do my task.

1511
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:33,060
Oh my gosh.

1512
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:33,640
Too much.

1513
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:40,160
We are with purple...no, we can't say the color.

1514
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:41,840
Wait, which one is it?

1515
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:42,140
This one?

1516
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:52,780
I wasn't...I wasn't doing anything!

1517
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:03,960
Where is this?

1518
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,780
Where is this?

1519
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:10,440
Decontamination.

1520
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:11,660
Under.

1521
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:15,140
Yes, under there.

1522
01:21:16,180 --> 01:21:19,680
Under decontamination and locker room.

1523
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:23,060
I found it but...

1524
01:21:24,820 --> 01:21:25,400
Who are you with?

1525
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:26,860
You.

1526
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,240
You.

1527
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:28,640
You.

1528
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:29,640
You.

1529
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:30,220
You.

1530
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:31,320
You.

1531
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,440
It's not a small you, it's a big you.

1532
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:35,960
You!

1533
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:38,220
You!

1534
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,020
You!

1535
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:40,700
You!

1536
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:47,300
I was with you, but there was only two of us.

1537
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,320
I was with you, but...

1538
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:56,640
But...

1539
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,220
You was dead.

1540
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:12,220
But you was inside the laboratory.

1541
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:18,940
I see.

1542
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,720
I don't understand at all.

1543
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:27,120
I don't understand at all.

1544
01:22:27,820 --> 01:22:30,380
There are only three of us, so...

1545
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:38,480
I was with three people, and I think those three are fine.

1546
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:44,080
Who, you, and there was one more person, right?

1547
01:22:45,220 --> 01:22:47,640
Who, you, and you.

1548
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:54,280
When there was a disturbance...

1549
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,960
You and...

1550
01:22:58,960 --> 01:22:59,580
Who?

1551
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:00,780
I think it's you.

1552
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:04,900
You and you.

1553
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:05,680
You didn't do anything.

1554
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:08,840
I did it.

1555
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:09,980
You?

1556
01:23:10,660 --> 01:23:11,800
You?

1557
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,100
You?

1558
01:23:13,100 --> 01:23:13,140
You?

1559
01:23:14,260 --> 01:23:14,740
You?

1560
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:15,840
You?

1561
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:18,820
You?

1562
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:19,160
You?

1563
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:19,540
You?

1564
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,660
We are definitely going to die.

1565
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,860
No, I have just one more.

1566
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,220
I have to go back to the reactor.

1567
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,420
I have no idea what's going on.

1568
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:42,000
I then added the Nihongo debuff.

1569
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:42,960
It's too difficult.

1570
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,940
Too muzukashii for me.

1571
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:50,380
Too muzukashii for...

1572
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:52,380
For me.

1573
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:58,000
I got it.

1574
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,180
Ok.

1575
01:24:01,640 --> 01:24:03,040
I did it!

1576
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,660
I did it!

1577
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:11,400
I did it!

1578
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,400
I did it!

1579
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:15,340
Oh my God, it

1580
01:24:21,420 --> 01:24:22,780
was...

1581
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,840
It's too strong.

1582
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:26,380
Why?

1583
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:30,420
Koya-chan, aren't there a lot of impostors?

1584
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,220
Right?

1585
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:36,160
It's not rigged.

1586
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,920
You played this game too much, bro.

1587
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,880
Rigged, rigged, rigged.

1588
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,700
Rigged, rigged.

1589
01:24:45,740 --> 01:24:49,820
I sent you a new name, so I will send you a new game.

1590
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,500
A new name.

1591
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:00,460
What is this name?

1592
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,100
Is it easy to play?

1593
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:03,400
What is this?

1594
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,040
It's easy, right?

1595
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:13,400
Why my name is...

1596
01:25:17,180 --> 01:25:19,280
Amazing, my name is...

1597
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:20,560
I think this one is good.

1598
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,460
This one.

1599
01:25:22,460 --> 01:25:25,460
Hurry, hurry.

1600
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:37,010
Cute.

1601
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,250
I will send you too.

1602
01:25:45,830 --> 01:25:46,470
I will laugh.

1603
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:48,610
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

1604
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:52,030
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

1605
01:25:54,210 --> 01:25:56,070
I know, I know.

1606
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:02,710
I can't do bad things.

1607
01:26:05,930 --> 01:26:06,350
Why?

1608
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:08,630
I will send you too.

1609
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:11,410
I will send you too.

1610
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:16,570
I know, I know.

1611
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,440
Asukaru, Asukaru.

1612
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,180
Let's go.

1613
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:39,240
Good night, good night.

1614
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:46,980
I'm just a little haha.

1615
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:49,340
I want to shower heehee.

1616
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:51,820
Heehee haha.

1617
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:53,760
Heehoo.

1618
01:26:57,220 --> 01:26:57,700
Nothing here.

1619
01:27:10,540 --> 01:27:11,420
How do we go in?

1620
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:12,520
How do we go in?

1621
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:13,340
How do we go in?

1622
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:28,100
Yay!

1623
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,280
Mwahaha Ichi and Mwahaha regular both did it.

1624
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,400
This one I gotta do.

1625
01:27:41,740 --> 01:27:43,740
Oh wait, I'm kinda bad at this.

1626
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:44,260
Wait, oh here.

1627
01:27:50,050 --> 01:27:50,590
Nice.

1628
01:27:51,410 --> 01:27:52,250
Task completed.

1629
01:28:00,830 --> 01:28:01,790
Guys,

1630
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:11,650
don't laugh.

1631
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:13,030
Hahaha.

1632
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:15,030
Where?

1633
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:19,290
Adomi?

1634
01:28:19,570 --> 01:28:22,110
Was dead at Adomi.

1635
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:30,390
I was at laboratory.

1636
01:28:31,690 --> 01:28:34,550
I was at reactor with Orororo.

1637
01:28:34,750 --> 01:28:36,490
Orororo I think is talking.

1638
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:44,030
I was just at storage.

1639
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:46,970
There was a point I was alone with Wara and they didn't kill me.

1640
01:28:47,070 --> 01:28:48,590
So I think Wara is OK.

1641
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:54,970
Wara Wara is OK?

1642
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:56,710
No, Wara is OK.

1643
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:04,250
Someone was after me.

1644
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,130
Who?

1645
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:05,210
Who?

1646
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:09,670
No, who was last game.

1647
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,320
I was from admin and then I go to cafeteria.

1648
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,160
Guys, I'm proud of that one.

1649
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,220
But it was before the...

1650
01:29:35,220 --> 01:29:36,020
Who's dying?

1651
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:38,000
Ha ha ha ha.

1652
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:40,680
Ha ha ha.

1653
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:42,900
Ha ha ha.

1654
01:29:50,580 --> 01:29:51,060
Anyone?

1655
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:51,540
Any...

1656
01:29:52,240 --> 01:29:52,720
Arguments?

1657
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:54,620
I don't see anyone.

1658
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:05,100
I think I don't have enough information on Haha, Hiki, Ora Ora, Wara Wara, any of these.

1659
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:08,480
I'm just Hihihaha.

1660
01:30:08,580 --> 01:30:11,960
Next time it could be Hi, it could be Kusai, it could be Wara Wara.

1661
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:13,160
Wara Wara.

1662
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,560
Wara Wara.

1663
01:30:14,860 --> 01:30:15,560
Wara Wara.

1664
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,840
Bye bye!

1665
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:29,780
OK guys, we gotta go to the balcony and we gotta do our little task here.

1666
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,780
Begin to data...

1667
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,120
Download...

1668
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:38,000
Downloading ransomware onto the computer.

1669
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,740
I'm gonna do this.

1670
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:48,440
Complete 10 tasks.

1671
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,900
Do you think someone else will get it?

1672
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,200
Maybe not.

1673
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,400
Oh gosh, everybody is up here.

1674
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:55,400
Wait, wait.

1675
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,440
Wait, we have 22 seconds until...

1676
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,420
I'm gonna go look around and see if there is anyone dead.

1677
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,500
This one is hard to use.

1678
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:19,140
Oh my gosh.

1679
01:31:19,780 --> 01:31:21,100
Too many words.

1680
01:31:24,420 --> 01:31:25,020
Nakamita!

1681
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,080
Nakamita!

1682
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:37,360
I saw someone.

1683
01:31:37,420 --> 01:31:38,400
I saw someone.

1684
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:43,760
I was doing the job in the top left.

1685
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:49,300
Near the body but...

1686
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,720
Because I don't see the screen.

1687
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:54,020
But then when I go back, it's dead.

1688
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,080
I saw...I saw...

1689
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,960
I was like 3 people there but I don't know who.

1690
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:06,040
Because I'm not familiar with the map so I opened the map so many times.

1691
01:32:06,860 --> 01:32:07,640
Oh my god.

1692
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:08,300
What is this?

1693
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:11,220
I saw...I saw...I saw a corpse.

1694
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:11,800
Oh my god.

1695
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:13,400
Wait a moment.

1696
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:14,300
I heard...I saw...

1697
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:14,940
I saw someone's head.

1698
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,840
Wearing something.

1699
01:32:29,940 --> 01:32:32,980
I saw 3 people but...

1700
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,100
In front of me...

1701
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:36,320
A straw...

1702
01:32:36,320 --> 01:32:36,620
Died.

1703
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:36,900
A straw?

1704
01:32:37,420 --> 01:32:38,220
A straw died.

1705
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:41,820
I'm a little...

1706
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:44,580
Who were the other two?

1707
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,000
Futsan?

1708
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,320
Futsan and Hehe.

1709
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:48,740
That's suspicious.

1710
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:51,380
Futsan and Futsan and Hehe.

1711
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:53,660
Futsan!

1712
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:02,320
Futsan!

1713
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:02,500
Futsan!

1714
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:03,320
Where is Futsan?

1715
01:33:05,820 --> 01:33:06,900
Futsan!

1716
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:08,940
Futsan!

1717
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:11,600
Futsan!

1718
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:12,000
Futsan!

1719
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:16,360
I saw a pink mask but...Hehe.

1720
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:19,200
Futsan and Hehe?

1721
01:33:19,200 --> 01:33:20,540
Which one?

1722
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:21,040
Hoho?

1723
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,680
New member?

1724
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,320
That's great!

1725
01:33:40,980 --> 01:33:42,380
Goodbye!

1726
01:33:42,380 --> 01:33:42,640
Goodbye!

1727
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:51,680
I'm done with tasks so I'm just gonna wander around.

1728
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,840
Let's follow...

1729
01:33:57,880 --> 01:33:59,420
We'll go upstairs.

1730
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:04,380
This is so strange especially because I played...

1731
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:13,680
I played Henry Stickmin recently so all these sounds are so...

1732
01:34:13,680 --> 01:34:15,520
Now I'm thinking Henry Stickmin.

1733
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:21,280
I played it just recently.

1734
01:34:26,820 --> 01:34:29,540
Oh my gosh, I'm doing...

1735
01:34:34,380 --> 01:34:34,580
I'm doing...

1736
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:43,520
I'm watching.

1737
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:46,960
I'm gonna make sure that she doesn't die.

1738
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:59,220
If you could roll, lolo impostors.

1739
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:00,620
Alright.

1740
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,040
What if it's all three of them?

1741
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:07,460
Don't stack you guys!

1742
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,920
What if it's all three of them?

1743
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,040
Where is she going?

1744
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:17,680
It would be like sus if I followed her.

1745
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,880
Do I look too much like a fangirl?

1746
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:21,360
Am I fangirling too much?

1747
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:28,880
Oh my gosh.

1748
01:35:29,200 --> 01:35:30,420
I found you.

1749
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:31,800
Grass!

1750
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:33,660
Grass!

1751
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,280
Grass?

1752
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:37,120
I want to kill you.

1753
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,100
Grass?

1754
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:39,860
Grass?

1755
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:42,740
Grass!

1756
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,740
Which one?

1757
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,900
Grass!

1758
01:35:47,900 --> 01:35:48,520
Grass!

1759
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:49,280
Grass!

1760
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:49,480
Grass!

1761
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,020
Grass?

1762
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:52,780
Grass!

1763
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:53,420
Which one?

1764
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:54,020
Not grass.

1765
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:54,720
Grass!

1766
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:55,880
Grass!

1767
01:35:57,640 --> 01:36:01,540
OK Me?

1768
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,360
Ola, Ola, Ola...

1769
01:36:04,360 --> 01:36:06,280
Very sus.

1770
01:36:08,180 --> 01:36:12,180
There was an emergency, but they didn't do it.

1771
01:36:12,980 --> 01:36:13,400
That's right.

1772
01:36:14,100 --> 01:36:17,040
Can someone translate that for me?

1773
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,900
During the reactor meltdown Ola, Ola, Ola didn't do anything.

1774
01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:24,340
Because my name is so long to kill someone.

1775
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:31,240
I cannot kill someone because my name is so big and long.

1776
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,700
My name is too long.

1777
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:38,800
I can see it.

1778
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:42,340
Jack-san?

1779
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:44,540
Grass.

1780
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:47,580
The two people who killed me are the culprits.

1781
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:51,080
Ha and Kusa are the culprits.

1782
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:53,540
Ha and Kusa?

1783
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,380
Ha and Kusa?

1784
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:01,260
Who is not doing their...oh sorry.

1785
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:03,000
Who is not doing their tasks?

1786
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,600
Oh no, the meat.

1787
01:37:05,740 --> 01:37:06,540
Looks yummy though.

1788
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:07,380
Mixed with pineapple.

1789
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:11,420
I hope someone kills me right now.

1790
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:12,800
Someone kill me.

1791
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:15,140
I'm gonna go to a remote location.

1792
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,560
I'm gonna wish for death.

1793
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,340
Somebody kill me.

1794
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:22,740
Somebody kill me.

1795
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:26,340
Somebody kill me.

1796
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,460
I'm wishing for death today.

1797
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:32,600
I hope I die.

1798
01:37:33,900 --> 01:37:39,780
I hope I never see the light of day again.

1799
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,160
Why is everybody here?

1800
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:45,700
Comms?

1801
01:37:45,740 --> 01:37:48,100
What a strange thing to sabotage right now.

1802
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,720
You're already dead though.

1803
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,480
Maybe that's why I want to die again.

1804
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:57,860
It's how I feel more comfortable.

1805
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:01,340
Nice game!

1806
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:16,520
I should have just...I should have just changed my name to Hetakuso instead of Kusa.

1807
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:36,260
I thought actually...I know it's not Koyo-chan because nobody is dying.

1808
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:41,480
You get a point!

1809
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,080
Good point, good point.

1810
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:46,460
Oh my god.

1811
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:10,200
You can change your name if you want.

1812
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:12,620
We'll just do a quick hide and seek.

1813
01:39:16,940 --> 01:39:18,120
Nobody is here.

1814
01:39:21,680 --> 01:39:25,740
I should have played this game before.

1815
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:27,640
I should practice.

1816
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,030
Koyo-chan!

1817
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:40,010
How many hours did you play this game?

1818
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:42,630
I really didn't play that much.

1819
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:43,790
Really?

1820
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:46,870
I'm going to check on your Steam profile.

1821
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:50,190
I don't have the evidence.

1822
01:39:51,050 --> 01:39:53,050
What is my play hours?

1823
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:55,890
Hold on, hold on.

1824
01:39:55,970 --> 01:39:56,810
I'm going to figure this out.

1825
01:39:56,910 --> 01:39:58,250
Let me get on Steam real quick.

1826
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:04,290
Because you're so good in the game!

1827
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:07,010
Oh my god, why is everybody dead?

1828
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:10,570
I'm just aggressive because I play games where I beat people up.

1829
01:40:10,570 --> 01:40:12,850
I play Tekken.

1830
01:40:13,030 --> 01:40:15,130
Oh yeah, you kill people.

1831
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:18,870
You have almost 20 hours in Among Us.

1832
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:20,270
No, I have 15.7!

1833
01:40:20,610 --> 01:40:22,230
15.7, that's a huge difference.

1834
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:23,590
That's like 25% more.

1835
01:40:24,010 --> 01:40:26,590
It says 19.2 hours on record.

1836
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:28,090
No, it says 15!

1837
01:40:28,810 --> 01:40:30,010
It says 19.2.

1838
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:34,390
Don't be so humble.

1839
01:40:35,470 --> 01:40:37,750
I only play like...

1840
01:40:44,970 --> 01:40:46,050
Is it?

1841
01:40:46,350 --> 01:40:47,330
Is it though?

1842
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:48,250
Is it though?

1843
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:55,570
Oh my god, I just hope...I don't have any expectations.

1844
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:58,750
I just hope I'm not an impostor and I'm not dying.

1845
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:06,410
How are you?

1846
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:20,410
This map!

1847
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:22,770
This map!

1848
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:23,330
Oh my god.

1849
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:35,350
What is this?

1850
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:36,970
What is this?

1851
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:39,210
This map is so difficult!

1852
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:44,590
This map...oh where am I?

1853
01:41:44,710 --> 01:41:45,170
How do you go here?

1854
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:49,450
What is this?

1855
01:41:55,510 --> 01:42:00,970
I'll come back.

1856
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:08,810
Wait, someone died right in front of me.

1857
01:42:08,870 --> 01:42:08,950
Ok.

1858
01:42:12,170 --> 01:42:13,910
No more scary!

1859
01:42:14,270 --> 01:42:15,070
Please don't die!

1860
01:42:21,050 --> 01:42:24,470
Scary, scary, scary.

1861
01:42:25,110 --> 01:42:26,730
I have a bad feeling about this.

1862
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:27,490
Where is it?

1863
01:42:27,810 --> 01:42:28,650
Where is it?

1864
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:29,550
It's over there.

1865
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:31,390
I didn't do anything.

1866
01:42:36,770 --> 01:42:37,810
The tiger...

1867
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,190
Nice ID.

1868
01:42:40,390 --> 01:42:40,690
Nice ID.

1869
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:40,710
Nice ID.

1870
01:42:40,710 --> 01:42:41,130
Where is it?

1871
01:42:41,730 --> 01:42:43,370
Where is it?

1872
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:53,630
What should I do with this?

1873
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:54,970
Oh my god.

1874
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:56,350
I'm so locked in.

1875
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:57,410
I'm so locked in.

1876
01:43:01,670 --> 01:43:02,750
Why so many?

1877
01:43:03,950 --> 01:43:05,330
How do I get there?

1878
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:10,330
How do I get there?

1879
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:14,650
How do I get there?

1880
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:19,890
How do I get there?

1881
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:22,210
I can't get down.

1882
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:31,730
There are so many!

1883
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:43,750
I want to go to the toilet.

1884
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:55,450
I really died.

1885
01:43:55,450 --> 01:43:57,030
I really died.

1886
01:43:57,930 --> 01:43:58,670
Oh my god, a birdie.

1887
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:01,850
Are you ok?

1888
01:44:03,470 --> 01:44:04,650
You can do it!

1889
01:44:10,630 --> 01:44:11,190
It's dangerous.

1890
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:15,970
It's dangerous.

1891
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:15,970
It's dangerous.

1892
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:16,210
It's dangerous.

1893
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:18,530
It's dangerous.

1894
01:44:20,050 --> 01:44:20,990
I saw it!

1895
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:21,850
I saw it!

1896
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:22,390
I saw it!

1897
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:22,970
I saw it!

1898
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:23,870
I saw it!

1899
01:44:23,950 --> 01:44:25,850
I saw it!

1900
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:25,850
I saw it!

1901
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:30,410
Stop it!

1902
01:44:36,710 --> 01:44:38,750
It's up.

1903
01:44:40,730 --> 01:44:41,330
It's up.

1904
01:44:41,950 --> 01:44:43,410
Everyone is here.

1905
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:50,370
What is this?

1906
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,890
What is this?

1907
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:52,770
Stop it!

1908
01:44:53,570 --> 01:44:54,030
Stop it!

1909
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:56,330
Everybody is here.

1910
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:57,570
It's dangerous.

1911
01:44:59,370 --> 01:44:59,630
It's dangerous.

1912
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:00,370
It's dangerous.

1913
01:45:00,630 --> 01:45:02,570
Let's die together.

1914
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:04,870
Wait, wait, wait.

1915
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:06,430
1...

1916
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:07,430
Yay!

1917
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:24,440
Everyone is running away.

1918
01:45:25,210 --> 01:45:27,260
Everyone is running away.

1919
01:45:31,220 --> 01:45:32,280
It's dangerous.

1920
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:35,760
It's too wide.

1921
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:39,500
It's too wide.

1922
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:40,820
It's too wide.

1923
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,860
Where should I go?

1924
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:49,660
It doesn't open at all.

1925
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:51,020
It doesn't open at all.

1926
01:45:52,020 --> 01:45:53,600
I got lost.

1927
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,320
I got lost too.

1928
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,720
It was fun.

1929
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:06,960
It was fun!

1930
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:13,020
I want to take a picture.

1931
01:46:13,020 --> 01:46:13,320
I want to take a picture.

1932
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:19,440
What should I do?

1933
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:21,940
What should I do?

1934
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,760
Heart?

1935
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,960
Let's make a heart!

1936
01:46:27,980 --> 01:46:28,240
Let's make a heart!

1937
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,200
Let's make a heart!

1938
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:30,760
Can you do it?

1939
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:31,200
Can you do it?

1940
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:42,040
It's a good place.

1941
01:46:42,440 --> 01:46:45,960
I can see it.

1942
01:46:47,280 --> 01:46:49,360
But you can do it.

1943
01:46:51,900 --> 01:46:55,520
The coin on love is hidden.

1944
01:47:02,140 --> 01:47:04,140
We have like a gap here.

1945
01:47:04,340 --> 01:47:05,260
Yeah, there is a gap.

1946
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,220
I can come over here.

1947
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:08,600
Nice, nice, nice.

1948
01:47:13,200 --> 01:47:14,160
So cute!

1949
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:17,540
Cheese!

1950
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:22,440
Yay!

1951
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:22,760
We did it!

1952
01:47:26,150 --> 01:47:27,680
Please take a picture later.

1953
01:47:28,620 --> 01:47:31,500
I will send it to you later.

1954
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,460
Thank you!

1955
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:36,400
Thank you everyone for participating.

1956
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,200
Thank you for your time.

1957
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,020
Thank you!

1958
01:47:40,980 --> 01:47:41,660
It was fun!

1959
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:43,860
It was fun.

1960
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:45,700
It was fun.

1961
01:47:46,540 --> 01:47:55,280
I apologize if I talk something that is not nice.

1962
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:03,560
Thank you so much for the time and the fun.

1963
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,840
It was such a blast.

1964
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,300
Thank you so much for inviting me, Koya-chan.

1965
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:10,480
Let's play again later sometime.

1966
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:11,200
Of course!

1967
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:13,440
Thank you!

1968
01:48:15,700 --> 01:48:17,640
Sorry for calling people sus.

1969
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:18,220
Thank you!

1970
01:48:20,520 --> 01:48:22,900
You can call me sus anytime.

1971
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:27,600
You're sus too.

1972
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:36,000
I want to say thank you Miki Queen-chan-san for playing with me.

1973
01:48:36,160 --> 01:48:40,280
Probably because we will not have the chance again.

1974
01:48:45,700 --> 01:48:47,100
It was very fun.

1975
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:47,900
Very fun collab.

1976
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:48,760
Thank you very much.

1977
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,900
Thank you so much to Koya for organizing!

1978
01:48:53,580 --> 01:48:54,660
Thank you Koya!

1979
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:57,320
Thank you for inviting me!

1980
01:48:58,680 --> 01:48:59,920
Thank you!

1981
01:49:01,260 --> 01:49:01,960
It was fun.

1982
01:49:03,200 --> 01:49:04,220
It was fun!

1983
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:07,820
Let's play again sometime.

1984
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:09,360
Let's play again!

1985
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,360
Let's play again!

1986
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:12,980
Let's play again sometime.

1987
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:16,360
Koya for the win!

1988
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:32,540
Let's go from top to bottom.

1989
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:34,740
You can say whatever you want.

1990
01:49:34,780 --> 01:49:35,280
Something short.

1991
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,600
Any announcement you want.

1992
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:39,700
And we just go from top to bottom.

1993
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,760
Alright, I'll make this short.

1994
01:49:44,180 --> 01:49:47,360
First of all, thank you very much Koya-chan for inviting me.

1995
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:48,920
Thank you for inviting me.

1996
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:54,460
Today's collab was very fun.

1997
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,960
I want to play again.

1998
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:57,860
Thank you!

1999
01:49:58,120 --> 01:49:59,780
And another announcement.

2000
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,700
I'll be having a maid cafe event on my birthday which is on May 4th.

2001
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,640
So if you're interested, please do check it out.

2002
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,340
Happy birthday maid cafe!

2003
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:12,540
Let's go!

2004
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:24,700
Thank you very much!

2005
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:25,860
It was fun.

2006
01:50:35,340 --> 01:50:39,300
Thank you very much!

2007
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:43,620
I have no announcement.

2008
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:45,700
I had so much fun.

2009
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:46,220
It was fun.

2010
01:50:47,220 --> 01:50:49,300
I want to touch Koya-chan's tail.

2011
01:50:53,320 --> 01:50:55,880
I want to pet Koya's tail.

2012
01:50:58,060 --> 01:50:59,200
I want to!

2013
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:00,920
That's all.

2014
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:02,120
Thank you very much.

2015
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:04,340
Thank you very much!

2016
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:11,480
I have no announcement.

2017
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,840
Please be careful of Koya's butt.

2018
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,220
Please be careful.

2019
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,380
That's all.

2020
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:25,380
Thank you very much for opening the collab, Koya-chan!

2021
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,740
Thank you so much for setting up the collab.

2022
01:51:29,060 --> 01:51:32,800
And everyone beware of Koya's butt.

2023
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:33,800
Thank you!

2024
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:43,920
It was so much fun.

2025
01:51:44,780 --> 01:51:48,320
Thank you so much to Koya for inviting me as well.

2026
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:51,340
Announcements, I have a new cover out.

2027
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,060
Yeah, that's about it.

2028
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:58,140
But thank you so much, I had a lot of fun with everyone.

2029
01:51:58,260 --> 01:51:59,480
It was nice meeting you all.

2030
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:00,780
Thank you!

2031
01:52:05,060 --> 01:52:12,180
I want to say thank you to Koya-chan for inviting me.

2032
01:52:12,440 --> 01:52:15,480
Even though I'm not officially EN's speaker.

2033
01:52:16,120 --> 01:52:18,820
And I don't also speak English that good.

2034
01:52:19,080 --> 01:52:21,300
But thank you so much for inviting me to the game.

2035
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:27,240
Everyone here, it's my first time to have this big collaboration.

2036
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:28,620
And I'm nervous.

2037
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:32,680
I've never been in a big collab before.

2038
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:34,060
And this is my first time.

2039
01:52:34,260 --> 01:52:35,120
So thank you so much.

2040
01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:38,060
And that was very, very fun.

2041
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:42,260
I hope we can play sometime in the future.

2042
01:52:43,060 --> 01:52:44,240
And yeah, that's it.

2043
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:44,860
Thank you so much.

2044
01:52:44,940 --> 01:52:47,680
And I have nothing, no announcements.

2045
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,560
Yes, all good.

2046
01:52:51,280 --> 01:52:52,180
Thank you!

2047
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:52,400
Thank you!

2048
01:52:58,140 --> 01:53:00,140
I don't really have any announcements.

2049
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:01,900
But I just wanted to thank Koya.

2050
01:53:02,040 --> 01:53:03,320
Thank you so much for inviting me.

2051
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,740
And everyone, thank you!

2052
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:06,900
I had a lot of fun playing with you.

2053
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:08,240
I can't speak!

2054
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:12,740
I had a lot of fun!

2055
01:53:14,080 --> 01:53:15,200
I had a lot of fun!

2056
01:53:15,200 --> 01:53:16,920
I had a lot of fun!

2057
01:53:22,500 --> 01:53:23,820
Koya-chan, thank you.

2058
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:24,900
And everyone, thank you.

2059
01:53:24,980 --> 01:53:26,020
Thank you everyone.

2060
01:53:26,220 --> 01:53:29,840
Please play again, I want.

2061
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:38,180
And this year, I will participate in American events and German events.

2062
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:41,060
Please look forward to it.

2063
01:53:43,440 --> 01:53:44,820
Please look forward to it.

2064
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:46,560
And...

2065
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,720
And what else?

2066
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:49,160
Nothing.

2067
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,640
Thank you.

2068
01:53:51,540 --> 01:53:54,640
Next, I will practice playing tag.

2069
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:58,440
I need practice playing tag.

2070
01:53:59,060 --> 01:53:59,380
I'm sorry!

2071
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:00,380
Thank you!

2072
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:03,660
It's okay, it's okay.

2073
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:04,020
It's okay.

2074
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:11,160
Thank you very much.

2075
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:16,400
I'm really sorry I can't speak English.

2076
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,540
The lobby is laughing!

2077
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:20,120
It's okay, it's okay.

2078
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,380
Then, let's say bye-bye in the lobby.

2079
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:23,800
Bye-bye!

2080
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,780
Bye-bye!

2081
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:27,080
Please go ahead.

2082
01:54:28,760 --> 01:54:31,520
Please play again if you like.

2083
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,020
Yes, please!

2084
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:39,240
I have no announcement.

2085
01:54:40,060 --> 01:54:40,460
Thank you.

2086
01:54:42,040 --> 01:54:43,200
Thank you!

2087
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:44,620
Thank you!

2088
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:46,520
Thank you.

2089
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:47,320
Thank you.

2090
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:54,540
Thank you everybody for joining and for all your help.

2091
01:54:54,660 --> 01:54:58,900
And thank you Mona for translating on the spot and stuff for me.

2092
01:54:59,780 --> 01:55:00,560
Thank you so much.

2093
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,260
I don't have any particular announcements, but I did upload some shorts.

2094
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,880
I'll be uploading a few more dance shorts, so check them out.

2095
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:12,560
You're so good!

2096
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,540
You're good at dancing!

2097
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:19,460
Amazing dance!

2098
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:19,860
Really good!

2099
01:55:19,860 --> 01:55:21,660
Please do my collaboration again in the future.

2100
01:55:22,480 --> 01:55:23,600
I love you!

2101
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:24,340
I love you!

2102
01:55:24,540 --> 01:55:26,200
I want to do a collab with everyone.

2103
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,020
Everyone is wonderful.

2104
01:55:28,820 --> 01:55:29,740
Let's play again.

2105
01:55:29,860 --> 01:55:30,940
Thank you everyone!

2106
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:32,740
Thank you everybody for that time!

2107
01:55:32,740 --> 01:55:33,260
Thank you!

2108
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:37,820
Shima-Ai-san, please go ahead.

2109
01:55:37,820 --> 01:55:39,900
It was so much fun!

2110
01:55:40,200 --> 01:55:42,680
Thank you so much for having such a wonderful party!

2111
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:46,740
Let's play again!

2112
01:55:47,820 --> 01:55:48,300
Thank you!

2113
01:55:48,820 --> 01:55:53,340
Right now, I'm doing a collab with Fuji-Q Highland and Kemono Friends V Project.

2114
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:55,200
It was so much fun!

2115
01:55:57,400 --> 01:56:01,480
We sold out the bus tour, but we're going to increase it.

2116
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:01,620
We're going to increase it!

2117
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:06,480
We're going to increase it, so please look forward to it!

2118
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:08,140
That's all!

2119
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:16,680
Thank you so much for inviting me today!

2120
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:20,580
Big, big, big, big, big thank you to Koyo-chan and everyone!

2121
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:21,760
Thank you everyone!

2122
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:25,900
It was so much fun, and I'd be happy to play again.

2123
01:56:25,900 --> 01:56:27,480
I have an announcement!

2124
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:40,000
Recently, a big box of 3D live goods will be on sale, so please take a look!

2125
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,920
Thank you!

2126
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,900
I finally got my 3D body, so if you...

2127
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:53,400
Play with me, please!

2128
01:56:56,640 --> 01:56:57,600
Congratulations!

2129
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:00,800
Thank you!

2130
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:02,120
That's all!

2131
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:05,120
Thank you so much!

2132
01:57:07,900 --> 01:57:09,540
I'm Rigm.

2133
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,560
Thank you so much for today.

2134
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:18,700
I'm not good at English, and I'm not good at Among Us, but I was able to do it with a smile thanks to these members.

2135
01:57:20,320 --> 01:57:21,160
Thank you so much!

2136
01:57:21,180 --> 01:57:21,500
It was fun!

2137
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:23,620
It was fun!

2138
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:23,820
It was fun!

2139
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:26,000
Everyone was so cute!

2140
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:27,680
I'm glad I met you all.

2141
01:57:28,320 --> 01:57:29,060
I heard your screams.

2142
01:57:30,020 --> 01:57:31,740
Yeah, I heard your screams.

2143
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:36,760
There are two types of voices in the promotion.

2144
01:57:37,420 --> 01:57:48,440
We've started making reservations for the Blu-ray of the event, so if you're interested, please take a look at the commercials.

2145
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:50,200
Thank you!

2146
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:51,100
Please take a look!

2147
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,980
Please take a look!

2148
01:57:53,780 --> 01:57:55,040
Yes,

2149
01:57:58,940 --> 01:58:00,100
I'm Lululululika!

2150
01:58:00,900 --> 01:58:02,240
It was fun!

2151
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:07,520
Thank you for inviting me!

2152
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,600
Thank you for inviting me!

2153
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:15,500
It's been a while, but I had a great Sunday while listening to everyone's screams.

2154
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:21,060
It's been a while, but I had a great Sunday while listening to everyone's screams.

2155
01:58:22,680 --> 01:58:29,780
As an announcement, it's the same agency as Rigm, so it's Rigm's thing.

2156
01:58:29,780 --> 01:58:37,500
I'm not saying anything, but Rigm and Lulu have a member who's the same age as them.

2157
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:42,820
The three of them have a new original song.

2158
01:58:44,740 --> 01:58:45,720
Congratulations!

2159
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:53,260
It's being broadcast on the sub-channel, so please listen to it if you like.

2160
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,200
Thank you very much!

2161
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:06,100
It was

2162
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:26,250
my first time playing tag, but it was really fun.

2163
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:29,230
There's no announcement.

2164
01:59:30,390 --> 01:59:31,190
What was it again?

2165
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:33,330
No suspense.

2166
01:59:37,090 --> 01:59:38,490
Announcement?

2167
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:39,730
Announcement?

2168
01:59:39,730 --> 01:59:41,030
One more announcement.

2169
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:42,730
Cute!

2170
01:59:45,890 --> 01:59:47,290
Cute!

2171
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:50,490
Let's collaborate again!

2172
01:59:50,550 --> 01:59:52,410
Welcome anytime!

2173
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:53,250
Welcome!

2174
01:59:56,470 --> 01:59:56,890
Welcome!

2175
01:59:58,010 --> 01:59:58,710
Welcome!

2176
02:00:00,350 --> 02:00:03,990
Thank you very much!

2177
02:00:05,090 --> 02:00:05,770
Cute!

2178
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:18,890
No cat!

2179
02:00:19,890 --> 02:00:20,230
No cat?

2180
02:00:20,590 --> 02:00:21,410
No cat!

2181
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:25,850
Brain...

2182
02:00:31,970 --> 02:00:33,050
Cute!

2183
02:00:34,030 --> 02:00:34,430
That's all.

2184
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:46,140
Thank you!

2185
02:00:48,540 --> 02:00:53,800
It's time to say goodbye, so the three of us will say goodbye.

2186
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:54,820
Yes.

2187
02:00:56,920 --> 02:01:00,660
Not bye-bye, but not sus.

2188
02:01:01,200 --> 02:01:02,640
Not sus?

2189
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:04,860
Not sus.

2190
02:01:04,860 --> 02:01:06,880
Not sus.

2191
02:01:07,700 --> 02:01:10,740
We do 3, 2, 1 and say not sus.

2192
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:12,940
Ready?

2193
02:01:15,540 --> 02:01:18,140
3, 2, 1...

2194
02:01:18,140 --> 02:01:19,060
Not sus!

2195
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:33,150
Alright.

2196
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:35,870
Bye-bye!

2197
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:37,810
Is

2198
02:01:43,110 --> 02:01:47,330
it OK for me to answer you guys?

2199
02:01:48,750 --> 02:01:50,510
Like, at your Discord?

2200
02:01:50,990 --> 02:01:51,150
Yeah!

2201
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:52,710
Please!

2202
02:01:53,490 --> 02:01:54,170
Thank you!

2203
02:01:57,410 --> 02:02:00,550
Yes, thank you so much.

2204
02:02:02,790 --> 02:02:04,970
OK, I deafened just in case.

2205
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:11,010
I didn't know if they were streaming and if they were going to say something, you know.

2206
02:02:12,010 --> 02:02:12,570
Yay!

2207
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:17,010
Thank you guys for...

2208
02:02:19,590 --> 02:02:22,310
It's a little bit short, but that's OK.

2209
02:02:22,490 --> 02:02:23,130
Short and sweet.

2210
02:02:24,270 --> 02:02:25,290
And I'm also so sleepy.

2211
02:02:25,970 --> 02:02:31,170
Thanks for another awesome stream and Olympic week, but texting wrong and posting the...

2212
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:32,530
I'm OK!

2213
02:02:32,670 --> 02:02:33,190
I'll sleep!

2214
02:02:34,070 --> 02:02:35,150
Thank you for the ping!

2215
02:02:35,610 --> 02:02:36,270
Thank you!

2216
02:02:36,270 --> 02:02:37,370
Thank you, thank you.

2217
02:02:37,590 --> 02:02:42,010
Thank you guys for a fun day, fun night.

2218
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:45,890
Everybody was so cute.

2219
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:47,170
Everybody was so sweet.

2220
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:50,410
I will see you guys...

2221
02:02:50,410 --> 02:02:50,850
I just came!

2222
02:02:53,890 --> 02:02:54,530
I just came.

2223
02:02:55,110 --> 02:02:55,590
I'm sorry.

2224
02:02:56,970 --> 02:02:58,730
I want to sleep.

2225
02:03:00,060 --> 02:03:00,730
I'm sleepy.

2226
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:09,910
I'm sleepy, so I'm going to bed.

2227
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:15,910
My head turned white.

2228
02:03:18,790 --> 02:03:19,350
I'm sorry.

2229
02:03:21,630 --> 02:03:22,670
Thank you guys!

2230
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:23,610
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

2231
02:03:23,890 --> 02:03:24,490
I'm going to bed.

2232
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:27,250
I'm going to dreamland.

2233
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:28,010
I'm going to dreamland.

2234
02:03:28,890 --> 02:03:29,490
What time is it now?

2235
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:33,290
It's 1.30am.

2236
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:36,050
Take it easy.

2237
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,450
Thank you.

2238
02:03:39,010 --> 02:03:40,730
The reaction was funny.

2239
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:42,390
Thank you!

2240
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,730
Thank you.

2241
02:03:45,950 --> 02:03:51,210
I was really nervous, but it was funny and I'm glad.

2242
02:03:52,210 --> 02:04:03,210
Even if I don't have confidence in Japanese, I want to work harder and speak more.

2243
02:04:03,870 --> 02:04:09,370
If I can play with everyone again someday...

2244
02:04:09,370 --> 02:04:10,330
Okay, I'm done.

2245
02:04:11,930 --> 02:04:12,630
It's over.
