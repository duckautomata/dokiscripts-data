Welcome in.

7
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,560
Hi.

8
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,880
Howdy, dody.

9
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,940
Hello, welcome back to Limbo.

10
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,520
Oh.

11
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, you shall.

12
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,820
prevail today, hopefully.

13
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:38,740
Hopefully!

14
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,980
Hi, Minikiri.

15
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:40,620
Hello!

16
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,360
My Kamiyoshi.

17
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,000
Thank you!

18
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,480
Thank you so much!

19
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,660
Hope you are feeling okay?

20
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,280
Guys, I got hit with the double whammy.

21
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,240
The double whammy, that is, head hort, tummy hort.

22
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,080
Being a ghost is so terrible.

23
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,460
It's just...

24
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:13,160
I'm just in the purgatory of never ending uh pain it's so
overrated people think oh my gosh you're dead you're not

25
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:20,180
gonna you're not gonna feel anything what do you think being
a ghost is huh what do you think being a ghost is

26
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:36,020
anyway so thank you i i uh vaude watchers probably uh they
don't know but i took an extra woke up.

27
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,840
I just woke up from a nap.

28
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,220
Is it because you died of tummy hort?

29
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,600
I died of everything hort.

30
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,020
I died of heart break maybe.

31
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,080
Heart hort.

32
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:54,980
Head hort.

33
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,680
You ate too much pizza yesterday, didn't you?

34
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,880
Pizza would never betray me like that.

35
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,060
What are you talking about?

36
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:08,820
Pizza?

37
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,920
A comfort food.

38
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,920
Pizza would never do that to me.

39
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
What are you talking about?

40
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,140
Oh my god.

41
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,160
Sakana!

42
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,780
What the hell are you doing here?

43
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,020
Well, I also had tech issues right before the stream.

44
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,420
And what had happened was...

45
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:50,900
I, um, I, I, I, I opened up the game.

46
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,720
So I play this game on a separate computer, right?

47
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,420
I have a dual stream setup, so fancy.

48
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:05,760
But, um, I opened it and it, for some reason, even though I
had my Steam in, uh, offline or whatever, it was like, do

49
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,680
you want to remote play this game?

50
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,160
And I was like, you know what, I'll be honest.

51
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:24,920
and I just clicked okay I didn't read it all and I clicked
okay and then it started like desktop sharing to from from

52
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:37,940
my current computer but it was showing up through like the
through through the OBS so it was very confusing and I

53
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:46,920
didn't know how to get out of it And I was like, what's
going on?

54
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,900
And a classic, spamming okay until it works.

55
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,140
That's truly what I did.

56
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,900
I was like, open the game, open the game.

57
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,080
I don't care.

58
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,960
Open the game.

59
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:11,900
And it was like doing that thing where if I like move the
window in a certain way, it would do like an endless thing.

60
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:20,860
like like you know hall of mirrors type type situation with
my window and i was like i don't know how to get out of this

61
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:37,480
so i am sleepy and i don't remember the controls to this
game i also was scared i was like oh my gosh what if because

62
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:47,420
i did it in offline it like didn't save anything wants to
save to the cloud but if it's offline then will it save and

63
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:55,960
I was like stressing but I see resume so hopefully we're
okay I think we're okay not reading side effect of too many

64
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:10,120
audiobooks hey hey hey wait a second not reading is how the
brickster escapes jail so true pizzazz pizza it's all the

65
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:20,960
same right so let's make sure resume gets us okay last i
remember we were in a pretty tricky situation i believe we

66
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,860
were about to do a quite the puzzle so brickster mentioned

67
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:38,340
brickster that's my oshi actually no that guy is too smart
and the police in that in lego island town were too dumb

68
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:51,760
You know the Brickster Should go do a heist at the Louvre
Maybe he wouldn't get away I mean, wait I mean, maybe he

69
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,660
would get away

70
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,640
We need more heists, I think I think we need more Heists You
guys agree?

71
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:11,270
We need a little bit Less stupid crimes More heists that are
exciting if you steal a painting.

72
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,700
It's my birthday, Roxas!

73
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,660
Happy birthday!

74
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,880
Happy birthday to you!

75
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,020
Agreed.

76
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,000
So true.

77
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:25,980
Yeah!

78
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,240
Yeah!

79
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,700
Next you're gonna wanna steal the moon.

80
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,380
What am I?

81
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,580
A minion?

82
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,440
Minto becomes the Phantom Thief.

83
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,380
Yeah, we see more like your nemesis.

84
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,900
How much pizzazz needed to sacrifice to catch him?

85
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,800
How much?

86
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,440
The port!

87
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,560
Yeah, how many pizzas did we have to throw at him?

88
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,700
Man.

89
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,540
Anyway, I do have things that I gotta do later.

90
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,600
I will be at a maid cafe for many hours.

91
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,300

Oh my gosh.

97
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:03,510
Learning a game like this is going to be tricky.

98
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,250
We're relearning, I'd say.

99
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,790
Gotta go do family stuff.

100
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,490
Have fun!

101
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,730
I think I need to get up there.

102
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,010
There's like a lever.

103
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,410
That lever there, no?

104
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,510
So I think I need to get to this lever up here.

105
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,910
I'm not quite sure yet.

106
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,990
But what would it have to do with...

107
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,330
Oh.

108
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,490
I'm too small.

109
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,210
I'm too small still.

110
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,200
We know.

111
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,720
You don't know anything.

112
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,640
Hi, I'm family stuff.

113
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,240
How much of your power is stored in your Ahuge?

114
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,840
Much, much, much of my power.

115
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,080
So don't ever forget it.

116
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:18,860
this can't yeah that's stuck there oh you're one minute old

00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,280
Can you, like, edit him?

121
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,060
Yeah, I'm four years old!

122
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:43,900
And...

123
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,960
And he goes, you're the youngest person ever!

124
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,080
I'm four years old!

125
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:57,240
Sometimes when people say, like, you are blank years old, I
want to say, I'm four years old!

126
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:58,980
Meow.

127
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:00,740
Meow.

128
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,620
Okay, this is to help us get back up here.

129
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,540
here, clearly.

130
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,360
I'm confused, actually.

131
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,120
Wait, someone helped Grandma out.

132
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,300
What am I supposed to do here?

133
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:14,660
Oh!

134
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,800
Just kidding!

135
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,140
I made it.

136
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,260
Okay, wait.

137
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:36,940
I'm scared.

138
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,340
What if I don't make this, though?

139
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,240
Jump!

140
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,380
Ah!

141
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,920
Okay, I understand now.

142
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,980
Forever 19 is too early to be having a mid-afterlife crisis.

143
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,900
I'm four years old!

144
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,850
Oh, wait, uh, I forgot.

145
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,550
I forgot to do the first part.

146
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:11,930
Wait.

147
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,310
Turn off!

148
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:14,930
Turn off!

149
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,690
Okay, we're fine.

150
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,550
Okay, we need to lower this first.

151
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,670
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come, come.

152
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,050
Like here?

153
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,490
Wait, but it starts to tilt.

154
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,130
It starts to tilt forward.

155
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:34,290
So I think like a little...

156
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,090
Like here?

157
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,590
You are the youngest VTuber ever!

158
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,050
I'm five years old!

159
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,550
Doesn't go better.

160
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,270
It's slow.

161
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:50,830
Okay.

162
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,790
Maybe like...

163
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,410
Oh, that's still... Stop, stop.

164
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,490
Maybe like here.

165
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,350
How old is Minto really though?

166
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,690
I'm forever 19!

167
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:05,350
Okay.

168
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:07,430
Wait.

169
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,170
Nope.

170
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:08,650
Jump.

171
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:09,070
Alright.

172
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:13,590
Then we also... This is kind of tricky because... Which way
did I push it before?

173
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,930
Was it to the left or to the right?

174
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,450
I'd like...

175
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:30,870
it perfectly somehow I was a genius hmm whatever let's just
try oh wait uh give me wait give me to the other side no

back down I think I missed it you you What is 9 plus 10?

177
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,560

178
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,380
What is this a trick question?

179
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,260
Oh my gosh!

180
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,240
Wait, how?

181
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,130
It's 20!

182
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:16,850
What?

183
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,010
What is this?

184
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,910
Oh, how did I get it perfectly?

185
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,050
Literally the first time.

186
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,950
I tried both ways!

187
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,020
It's a reference to someone.

188
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:45,940
What is it?

189
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,720
Like, germa?

190
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,620
I don't know.

191
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,580
Let's try it the other way.

192
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,850
It's that old vine.

193
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:56,550
Ah!

194
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,790
You youngsters.

195
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,190
Okay.

196
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,810
I wish I had been paying attention before.

197
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,050
Oh, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot!

198
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,450
Okay, my bud.

199
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,050
back up.

200
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,580
Vine does not mix with youngsters.

201
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,440
Um, for grandma it does.

202
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,100
All right, like there, I think.

203
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,740
Maybe like there.

204
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,340
Yeah, yeah, okay.

205
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,890
Why airplane might buy too bad.

206
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,730
Oh no!

207
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,390
I say you do wait!

208
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:53,030
See you!

209
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,370
Are you flying for Asha Yoru?

210
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,590
That's kind of insane.

211
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,380
So much pressure.

212
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Okay.

213
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,460
Wait, wait, wait.

214
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,620
Don't smush me.

215
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,580
Don't smush me.

216
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,900
Densetsu mint.

217
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,460
Densetsu mint.

218
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Dent.

219
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,420
High dent.

220
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:17,940
No!

221
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,080
I come in, dachi!

222
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,960
Okay, okay, that was not ideal, but that's okay.

223
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,360
Okay.

224
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,380
Please, swing it!

225
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:44,920
Ugh!

226
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,860
I hate physics!

227
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,100
I hate it!

228
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,200
Oh my gosh, gravity never needed to be advantage!

229
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,160
Oh wait, I need to push this first.

230
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,560
Okay, I need to push it this way first.

231
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,100
Okay.

232
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,940
So we can get optimal.

233
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,260
Okay.

234
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,200
Okay.

235
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,720
Hooy!

236
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,620
Okay.

237
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,220
Okay, we have the plan now.

238
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,040
Hooy!

239
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,680
First try, Phantom.

240
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,020
Me too cute.

241
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,660
Me too sweet though.

242
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,220
Hmm.

243
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,700
Yeah, you think I'm cute?

244
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,340
Really?

245
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,420
VOD Watchers skip ahead one hour.

246
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,940
Don't say that!

247
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:23,660
Huh?

248
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:37,620
Please!

249
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,760
No!

250
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,400
Why did it lose the momentum?

251
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:43,580
Why?

252
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,760
Why?

253
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:57,010
Oh, no.

254
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,230
Stop being a kid.

255
00:22:59,450 --> 00:22:59,790
Okay.

256
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,990
If only...

257
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,470
If only...

258
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:06,770
If

259
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,520
only...

260
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,600
One more time.

261
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,850
If I watchers, like, subscribe, and hit the bell.

262
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,310
Alright, alright, alright.

263
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:34,680
Oh.

264
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,850
Jump!

265
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,590
At least I didn't die.

266
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,150
You son of a bitch, why?

267
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,110
My timing.

268
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,650
We know you're cute.

269
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,010
Gotta climb up higher.

270
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,950
I'm literally at the max height!

271
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:34,350
I can't get any higher!

272
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,290
We can't get much higher!

273
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,870
That's the highest he'll go!

274
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,220
Oh!

275
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,880
It's the switch screws it up.

276
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,340
Okay, I see it now.

277
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,320
I need to propose to you.

278
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,220
Hold that.

279
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:03,840
Wait, what?

280
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,380
Huh?

281
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,260
I didn't get your meat and green.

282
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,720
So I did get dokeys.

283
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,790
Meet the very cute and spooky.

284
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,820
I can't tell if I need to do the switch sooner or maybe...

285
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:40,210
Shit!

286
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,170
Oh!

287
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,050
What if I had missed?

288
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,110
Oh, shoot.

289
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,270
I have to stand here.

290
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,510
I'm not even secured.

291
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,320
Oh my god, it was a checkpoint!

292
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
Oh my god, it was a checkpoint!

293
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,030
Okay, we're gaming.

294
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,910
Oh, blessed checkpoint.

295
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,430
Blessed checkpoint, for real.

296
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,130
Oh!

297
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,350
Oh my gosh, wait.

298
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,450
Oh,

299
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,860
I tried jumping.

300
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,480
Wait, okay, hold on.

301
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,360
I think I gotta jump.

302
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,940
Rage game, rage game.

303
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,280
Ah, oh, he like...

304
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,500
Okay, he, like, won't jump because he's too busy climbing
up.

305
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,120
Maybe I just...

306
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:09,620
Dangle.

307
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,140
Nope.

308
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,260
Okay, no dangling.

309
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,560
No dangling.

310
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,060
Jump!

311
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,320
Oh, it's still on!

312
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:21,240
What?

313
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,070
Oh.

314
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:41,990
Um.

315
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,410
Huh.

316
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,700
But now what?

317
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,780
What if I...

318
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,440
Just put you right?

319
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:11,370
Who invented this button?

320
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,130
Wait, what?

321
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:18,490
I don't understand how I could do it, though.

322
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,550
Yeah, the other track is still on, too.

323
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,030
Wait, if I press this, does that other track turn off?

324
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,640
It does not.

325
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,200
Okay.

326
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,620
Interesting.

327
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,760
But I still don't understand what I'm supposed to do about
it, you know?

328
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,740
I guess if I...

329
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,060
What?

330
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:10,540
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run, run, run, It's such a four

331
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,480
platform.

332
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,380
It's such a four platform, though.

333
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,440
What?

334
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,520
Yeah, there's not enough time.

335
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,220
Elf, friend.

336
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,440
Thank you so much for the five good.

337
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,320
Thank you.

338
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,340
No, elf.

339
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,700
Listen here.

340
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,360
Grandma is tired.

341
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,980
At least you have less momentum here, so it's a little less
fast,

342
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:56,410
but...

343
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:03,690
Oh, whoops.

344
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,110
It's so far away, right?

345
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,830
I feel like it has to be pixel perfect.

346
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,670
Unless maybe I don't... I don't know.

347
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,290
Like I get it to the very, very edge.

348
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,150
Less momentum at the start?

349
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:25,870
I don't know.

350
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,230
What if it's like here?

351
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,130
Will it roll down slower?

352
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:34,910
Oh!

353
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:35,210
Oh!

354
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:35,810
Oh!

355
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:36,110
Oh!

356
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,240
Oh!

357
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,480
I... Oh!

358
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Oh!

359
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Stop!

360
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,720
Stop!

361
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Stop!

362
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,200
Okay.

363
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,280
Yeah, we need it to be like really slow.

364
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,280
Like super slow.

365
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,460
Like this slow.

366
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,620
Stop!

367
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,490
Oh my god.

368
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,520
Snail's pace.

369
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,380
Oh, but it gets faster.

370
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,140
The idea is there, but you need it to be fast.

371
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:35,290
Wait.

372
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,060
Oh!

373
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,020
Oh, it bounced twice.

374
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,900
Wait, like that?

375
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Like kind of...

376
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,100
It presses and then...

377
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,560
Like, let's go?

378
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,360
Oh, oops.

379
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,960
No, bad.

380
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:53,580
Well, this is fine because...

381
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:57,590
Oh, I tried jumping.

382
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,910
I don't think it's enough time, though, no?

383
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,330
I don't think so.

384
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,510
I don't think it's the bounce either.

385
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,740
Yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't, like, let go enough.

386
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,460
It's too short of a gap, yeah.

387
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,000
I think this...

388
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,400
What?

389
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,640
How slow?

390
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,880
Can I get it to be, you know?

391
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,830
I don't feel like I'm getting any further.

392
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,440
Small studio in Copenhagen.

393
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,160
Oh, oh, oh, oops, oops.

394
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,790
A hit.

395
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:52,910
And a hit.

396
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,910
I wonder if I...

397
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,470
Hold it from the...

398
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,850
If it's like here, you know, let's see.

399
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,510
I'm going to see how slow it goes.

400
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,730
Well, that's kind of hard to tell because I'm still
technically pushing it.

401
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,680
I'm not making any progress at all.

402
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,080
He used

403
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,400
to be going to the left a little bit.

404
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:19,780
Oh, wait.

405
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,320
Oh, oh.

406
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:21,340
Oh.

407
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:38,370
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!

408
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:38,630
Oh!

409
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,340
I discovered something new!

410
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,490
Wait,

411
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,590
that's insane, it's so good.

412
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,830
Imagine if I was still there.

413
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,150
Oh!

414
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:29,200
wait a second I think I screwed myself wait oh never mind
we're fine holy okay I wish I could see anything though it's

415
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,160
kind of bad I think I take you

416
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:50,090
do I go up or down easy toes thank you so much for the thank
you thank you thank you thank you and maybe I can drop onto

417
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,710
that Now,

418
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,040
go this way, check it out.

419
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,810
Is that the light?

420
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,570
Or are those headlights?

421
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,970
Those are lasers.

422
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:10,310
Wait, those are lasers.

423
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,900
That's how my grandparents went to school.

424
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,340
Thank you so much, motherfucker.

425
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,780
Let's see what happens if I touch them.

426
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:50,070
understandable wait can I not get back up I just realized I
guess I was supposed to go down here but can I grab this guy

427
00:36:50,070 --> 00:37:08,920
for assistance no I guess I was supposed to go down here
then I think maybe I can jump oh not like that

428
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:20,160
okay Let's try.

429
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,040
Oh, oh, they don't stop.

430
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,280
Let's...

431
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,600
What if I jump downstairs?

432
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,220
There is no downstairs.

433
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:43,920
Oh my gosh.

434
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:44,680
I'm so bad.

435
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,350
There's no cooldown, it seems, either.

436
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,870
I mean, think of...

437
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,710
Thinko?

438
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,470
Thinko?

439
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:19,950
I just woke up.

440
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,450
I'm five years old!

441
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,160
Running during the wind down.

442
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,120
Yeah, but...

443
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,540
I guess... Yeah, let's try that.

444
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,060
Ah!

445
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,530
Why do I play Thinkie game today and tomorrow?

446
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,320
The top gun moved.

447
00:38:59,180 --> 00:38:59,940
Top gun.

448
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,000
I think the trick is to get them to shoot simultaneously.

449
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,600
Hey, why didn't the other one activate?

450
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:11,980
Oh.

451
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,100
Oh!

452
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:17,820
Oh!

453
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,980
Do I have to destroy this one?

454
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,380
Oh, wait.

455
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,520
Oh, it's starting to bleed.

456
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,920
It's starting to bleed.

457
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,240
Come on.

458
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:47,880
Yes.

459
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,140
Good, good, good.

460
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,180
The music stopped.

461
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,660
I broke the CD player, I think.

462
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,300
Oh my gosh.

463
00:39:59,740 --> 00:39:59,980
Okay.

464
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:10,470
Very good.

465
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,470
Is this...

466
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,270
Are those...

467
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:16,770
Is that...

468
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:17,150
A trap?

469
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,970
Why is it lumpy on the floor?

470
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,280
Just lumps.

471
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:34,940
Okay, we do parkour.

472
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:35,580
for real.

473
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,130
What's this button do?

474
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,700
Oh, interesting.

475
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,640
Oh, gosh.

476
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,140
This one.

477
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,700
Oh, no.

478
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,700
Why did we invent gravity?

479
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,100
Why did we do that?

480
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,300
Seriously, why did we do that?

481
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,140
I think I need...

482
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,360
Okay.

483
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:22,960
need I feel like I need one of the boxes to like slide down
or something like I push one of the boxes to time it to

484
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:35,580
slide and then that this so this one and then the other box
will go up there wait but how would I get up there how

485
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,040
would I get back up here

486
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,400
let me just for now try my plan

487
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,740
oh oh I think this guy needs to be already pushed over here.

488
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,300
I screwed up, I think.

489
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:17,480
There we go.

490
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,940
Uh, and then once he drops, I grab him.

491
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,560
Maybe?

492
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,060
Grab him, grab him, grab!

493
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,580
There we go.

494
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:24,940
Nice.

495
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,380
I figured it out.

496
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:32,550
Hoi!

497
00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:40,180
Oh my gosh, a puzzle that doesn't kill me.

498
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,880
I think, though, if they...

499
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,140
I think if they landed on me, though, they would have killed
me.

500
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,860
Where did this go?

501
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,920
Oh, what?

502
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,520
Wait, what?

503
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,260
Hmm?

504
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,200
Where do I need to go?

505
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,600
I can't tell.

506
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:08,640
Oh my gosh, wait.

507
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,140
Do I have to do the same thing, but with the ladder?

508
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:25,900
Jump.

509
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:26,920
The

510
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,680
ladder would push back up.

511
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,540
Oh.

512
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,580
I thought the ladder would push back up.

513
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:48,760
Oh my gosh, Immortal Flame.

514
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:49,440
Thank you so much for that.

515
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,700
Thank you!

516
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,590
Thank you, thank you!

517
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,060
Oh, okay.

518
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,980
I pretend you would have hit the ceiling.

519
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,660
Well, I didn't think about that.

520
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,520
I guess I could grab this block from over here.

521
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,580
Okay, maybe.

522
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,200
Hopefully it lifts up.

523
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:17,200
All right, let's do that again.

524
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh my gosh, wait, the window of opportunity here is like
actually so small.

525
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:45,140
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
run, run, run, run, run,

526
00:44:52,430 --> 00:45:04,230
okay one more time okay and then i think i have to like be
on here when it lifts because otherwise i cannot uh grab

527
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,850
that so it's gonna lift me up baby and then we go go go okay

528
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:19,910
we almost got boxed for real me when i'm like wow i'm
surprised it's a puzzle that doesn't Kill me!

529
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:22,150
Okay.

530
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,530
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

531
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,530
Run, run, run, run, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb,
climb.

532
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,130
Climb, climb, climb, climb, climb.

533
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:33,330
Run, run, run, run, run, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb.

534
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:33,630
Whoa!

535
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:41,440
We made it.

536
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,560
Whenever I was saying run, run, run, run, climb, climb,
climb, climb.

537
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,420
Do you guys remember that episode of the Powerpuff Girls
where they were watching?

538
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:03,100
the TV Mojo Jojo was was babysitting them and they're
watching the TV and the it's like the the sea serpent guy

539
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:12,100
Blarney the sea serpent whatever I don't remember and he's
just like if I were a fish I'd scream scream that's what I

540
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:23,760
was thinking holy nostalgia this is the elevator oh does

541
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:32,270
it go up any higher No.

542
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,190
Okay.

543
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:37,590
Mysterious tanking box.

544
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:38,330
Oh!

545
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:39,830
That is a laser.

546
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:43,430
Oh my gosh.

547
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,690
It's so hard to see it, though.

548
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:48,350
That's another laser.

549
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,640
Can I get on top of this?

550
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,340
I can get on top of this, though.

551
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:12,630
Oh!

552
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:14,730
My bad.

553
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,930
I knew that was coming.

554
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:20,070
I don't know why.

555
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,770
I just stood there and took it.

556
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,090
I was like, I can tank it.

557
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,830
I can tank it is what I said.

558
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,780
I don't know if I got shot, but I know that.

559
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,440
I literally just like, bonk.

560
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,800
Bounced off my head.

561
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:08,030
Okay, okay.

562
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:16,530
Now with this, does it block the bullets?

563
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:23,450
Oh.

564
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:27,890
Wait a second.

565
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,790
Oh my god.

566
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,990
I was like, why is that hole there?

567
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,180
Wow, environmental storytelling is crazy.

568
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,480
Okay.

569
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,180
Environmental storytelling goes crazy!

570
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:49,920
What is this now?

571
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:52,680
It's just a...

572
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,980
A wall that goes back and forth.

573
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,820
Very cool.

574
00:48:57,980 --> 00:48:59,940
I didn't realize we were...

575
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,420
Playing Portal all of a sudden, you know?

576
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:08,460
With all these turrets.

577
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,880
I think I have to be...

578
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,420
Well, what else is over here?

579
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:18,940
Trees.

580
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,200
Monkeys?

581
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,190
Oh, wait.

582
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:51,350
Oh, dang it.

583
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,850
I didn't realize that I wouldn't be able...

584
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:53,050
Wait.

585
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:54,070
Paul?

586
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:54,990
How do you do this?

587
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,130
Oh, I think I have to land...

588
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:57,750
Okay, I get it.

589
00:49:57,790 --> 00:49:58,110
I get it.

590
00:49:58,170 --> 00:49:58,450
I get it.

591
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:01,070
I have to land...

592
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:01,950
on it.

593
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:02,950
Unmute.

594
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:03,470
Okay, okay.

595
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,290
I got it.

596
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:04,990
I got it.

597
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,850
Environmental storytelling is a poem when there's no
dialogue.

598
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:12,590
True, so true.

599
00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:15,350
Oh, but...

600
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:17,450
How do I fall?

601
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,820
How do I fall?

602
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:28,800
Laser sees boy triggers gun.

603
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,120
Laser sees box and goes, It's a box.

604
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,360
Yeah.

605
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,880
Maybe it's a heat-seeking laser.

606
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,180
Anything to the far left.

607
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:50,380
Oh, good point.

608
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,340
I didn't explore over here.

609
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,340
Why is there grass on the side?

610
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,180
ceiling anyway.

611
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:03,360
There's a butterfly.

612
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,220
Can I even get up there?

613
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,260
Maybe with the box?

614
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,350
It's mold.

615
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,970
New avant-garde grass on ceiling.

616
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:32,250
Gardner was Australian.

617
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,790
Probably actually.

618
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,120
Keep on pushing.

619
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,280
Keep on pushing.

620
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,700
I don't even think I'll make it with the box though.

621
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,340
No!

622
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,460
How...

623
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,820
Do I get to the other side?

624
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:21,660
Or...

625
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:23,600
Like...

626
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,360
Maybe I have to be the speediest person.

627
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:27,860
What?

628
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,280
No.

629
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:31,300
I don't know.

630
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:32,160
Like...

631
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,800
So basically my dilemma is...

632
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:38,800
I...

633
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,460
say I push this box here.

634
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,280
Like...

635
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:47,220
here for

636
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:55,390
it to be on this thing how

637
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,500
do I get up here you know that's my dilemma

638
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,910
yeah I need two boxes but I only have one but

639
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,300
where would I even get the other one I

640
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:40,990
don't see anything else around here I tried like grabbing
here just in something behind the tree, but I don't.

641
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:42,750
Nothing gets caught.

642
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,570
There was one downstairs, was there?

643
00:53:47,810 --> 00:53:48,750
Wait, was there actually?

644
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:50,470
Did I miss it?

645
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:55,470
Come.

646
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:03,100
Go down, go fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,
fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.

647
00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:04,520
Oh, no!

648
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:05,840
Wait, we don't have my box!

649
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:10,600
Anymore?

650
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,800
It was that one.

651
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:15,540
Oh.

652
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:33,710
Yeah, this one's a thinker.

653
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,510
This one's a head scratcher.

654
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:49,410
Use the box to block the gun on top of the elevator.

655
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,870
But that doesn't...

656
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,250
I don't think that'll solve my problem.

657
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:00,270
Will it?

658
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:01,530
Was there another...

659
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,270
Because...

660
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:07,210
I don't think that'll...

661
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:07,870
Will that?

662
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:20,880
I mean, at this point, I have no other, I have no other
ideas, so...

663
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,400
We shall attempt...

664
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,340
But I don't even know where it was.

665
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,920
Yeah, can't hurt, that's true.

666
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,460
It could just be a big old waste of my time!

667
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:34,080
No, just kidding.

668
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,720
Is it...

669
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,320
What if I... right here?

670
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:38,800
Wait.

671
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,680
Oh, wait.

672
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:41,640
Uh...

673
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:49,500
the gun if I put it on the elevator it'll block it

674
00:55:54,620 --> 00:56:01,420
right kind of get it smack dab in the middle there maybe

675
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:31,420
nope redo why'd they make it so far away it might have
bounced off you think so?

676
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,300
Let's do like there.

677
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,400
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

678
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:00,530
I think I still see it.

679
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:08,920
Woo!

680
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,460
I don't think I'll be able to make it back, but I just want
to see, uh, maybe...

681
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,900
Where'd my box go?

682
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,400
Where is it?

683
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,100
Secret gauntlet level that's excessive.

684
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,780
by getting all secret collectibles.

685
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:29,520
Whoa.

686
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,440
Oh, there's my box!

687
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,020
What if I...

688
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,480
What if I'm overthinking it?

689
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,580
What if I just do this?

690
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,340
Oh, but now...

691
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,240
I can't get to...

692
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:17,800
I can't get back, though.

693
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,340
Wait a second, though.

694
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:21,840
Wait a second.

695
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,440
Hold on.

696
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,640
Push it a tiny bit.

697
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,300
Tiny bit like that.

698
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,980
Okay.

699
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,560
Alright.

700
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:44,120
Then maybe.

701
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,020
Jump!

702
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,140
Oh!

703
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,860
What is this?

704
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,770
Another box.

705
00:58:57,090 --> 00:58:57,870
We found it.

706
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,660
Come back to me.

707
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,180
Okay, now we need this bad boy.

708
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,600
Alright, alright.

709
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,820
Where are you going?

710
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:20,300
To...

711
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,040
What are you talking about?

712
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,920
I'm going to do the thing so that I can get the other box.

713
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,960
She's going to see her mom.

714
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,840
She's a very nice lady.

715
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,600
Where is it?

716
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,820
Where is it?

717
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:34,620
About to go all the way back there again?

718
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,600
Oh my god.

719
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:41,160
Let's see why it didn't flip.

720
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,080
Why it didn't come down.

721
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,280
Ugh.

722
01:01:03,070 --> 01:01:03,350
Oh.

723
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,290
Let's see.

724
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:17,760
Like, how am I You guys are like, where are you going?

725
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,620
But how am I even supposed to get that?

726
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,120
What am I even supposed to do here?

727
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:31,690
Oh, wait.

728
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,970
Oh, I just noticed that this was controlling.

729
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:42,150
I thought it, like, activated a thing to drop the box from,
like, a box container.

730
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,870
Eki, look about the key!

731
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:46,510
What?

732
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:55,700
What?

733
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,180
I did, too, to be honest.

734
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,480
Yeah, right!

735
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,000
It just came from nowhere!

736
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,500
How the hell am I supposed to do this though?

737
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,520
Damn it.

738
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:29,180
Not enough.

739
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:29,520
Wait.

740
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:30,780
Ah!

741
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:40,500
Ah!

742
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:41,440
No!

743
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:56,810
Stop rolling the wrong way!

744
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:26,940
Ah!

745
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,680
Oh, dang it.

746
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,920
I had it in a... Oh, nope, nope, nope, nope.

747
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:39,620
There we go.

748
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:43,650
Oh!

749
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:51,420
Oh!

750
01:03:52,300 --> 01:03:52,520
Oh!

751
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
So close!

752
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:04,860
So close!

753
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,280
No!

754
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,160
Oh, not enough.

755
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,260
Get it back up there.

756
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,200
Rotate that box!

757
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,800
Oh, oh, my bad.

758
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:58,420
Oh, oh my god.

759
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,800
Came in, coming in hot.

760
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:00,540
Coming in hot.

761
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:06,230
Oh, dang it!

762
01:05:15,970 --> 01:05:16,570
Yay!

763
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:25,960
Yay!

764
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:30,960
Okay!

765
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,100
Now it should be good.

766
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:37,260
When we...

767
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:37,620
Alright.

768
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:38,320
Come back.

769
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,900
Yeah, we'll just...

770
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,380
First try, Phantom.

771
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,020
And,

772
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,760
and, and, and... Dusty, thank you so much for the tangata!

773
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:53,440
Thank you!

774
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:54,840
Thank you so much.

775
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:56,360
Okay.

776
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,700
On the road again.

777
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,600
Wait, why'd you do that?

778
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,800
Oh my god, don't scare me.

779
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:08,760
Don't scare me like that.

780
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,450
You stay here.

781
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:27,350
Second trusty box.

782
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:32,110
Second...

783
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:34,450
Trusty box.

784
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:40,090
Alright, now here...

785
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,350
This is where it's gonna be all about timing.

786
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:50,750
How do I...

787
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,540
No, the timing is like, imperative here.

788
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:07,020
It's a good thing I'm a cat because I love boxes.

789
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:19,430
I wonder if this would do it.

790
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:22,750
I don't think so, though.

791
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,130
I don't think so.

792
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,180
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

793
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:36,860
Run, run, run, run, run.

794
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,280
Shit didn't believe.

795
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,420
First try!

796
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:49,700
More gravity!

797
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,390
That's a big boy.

798
01:07:55,870 --> 01:07:57,110
That thing will surely kill me.

799
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:57,950
What's this?

800
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:00,030
Okay.

801
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:03,610
What if we gravity with the magnet?

802
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:14,460
What else is going on in here?

803
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,760
I'm just pressing buttons.

804
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,300
Do I need that rope?

805
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,160
Oh, this thing also lifted up.

806
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:34,860
Interesting.

807
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:59,600
I don't even know how to get up there though.

808
01:09:02,700 --> 01:09:03,200
Parkour.

809
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:10,830
This one's a bit funky, is it?

810
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:15,190
You can jump onto the left platform.

811
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:16,410
Can I now?

812
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:21,770
Can I now?

813
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:28,790
I, wait, why am I not?

814
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,340
If I, I can hide there, that's one thing.

815
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,660
Oh wait, does this turn it off?

816
01:09:48,360 --> 01:09:50,700
That is, in fact, not a rope.

817
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,760
How am I supposed to turn it off?

818
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,600
Like, what is this rope for?

819
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:12,400
Okay.

820
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:13,560
I guess just for power?

821
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:38,350
One block is shorter.

822
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:39,690
What do you mean by that?

823
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,220
You remember it now?

824
01:12:22,490 --> 01:12:26,610
I do see that this one is sticking up over the edge.

825
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,690
If I go up...

826
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:30,790
Do I... Oh my gosh.

827
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,970
I don't become... I don't become anti-gravity.

828
01:12:37,650 --> 01:12:38,850
I don't think.

829
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:43,790
No.

830
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,120
Can you move the big box left and right?

831
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:52,240
This guy up here?

832
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,320
How can I even push him, though?

833
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:55,700
That's the thing.

834
01:13:02,710 --> 01:13:03,010
Huh?

835
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:09,580
What box are you guys talking about?

836
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:12,780
Stick left box.

837
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:15,000
Not right box.

838
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,510
What?

839
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:25,130
What?

840
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:32,390
You guys are trying to help, but I'm too stupid to
understand your hints.

841
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,040
Need to magnet the left one, but not the right one.

842
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:46,720
When I magnet, it does both of them.

843
01:13:47,660 --> 01:13:49,220
It's not like a left or right issue.

844
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,160
Grab off, mag off.

845
01:13:54,580 --> 01:13:55,520
Mag on.

846
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,360
Then quickly grab off.

847
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:00,140
Grab off.

848
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:01,660
Mag off.

849
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,220
Then quickly.

850
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:23,960
there's a delay before the fall yeah but it's still really
fast no wait if i but

851
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:40,240
to like push this i want to train now and there's a ghost
sitting next to me oh bring her as my plus one like you're

852
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,620
bringing another ghost to me me guys

853
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:57,200
i think i'm too brain dead to understand this one

854
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:05,670
like i i get what you guys are saying but i don't understand
it

855
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:24,560
brain rot i definitely said brain dead i think you have the
brain rot i think your brain is rotting i mean my brain is

856
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:31,620
rotting in other ways because my body is probably buried in
the somewhere.

857
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,560
My brain is already rotted.

858
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:49,320
Fiddle with grab.

859
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:50,440
Okay.

860
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:57,860
Wait, if I have the magnet on, there's no way for me to
fiddle with the gravity though.

861
01:15:58,580 --> 01:15:58,580
Uh.

862
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,980
Think of how much distance each box has to travel.

863
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:16,740
Need it to fall?

864
01:16:16,900 --> 01:16:19,260
I don't understand what you guys are saying at all.

865
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:23,020
You guys are literally speaking like a different language to
me right now.

866
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:27,660
You guys are like definitely...

867
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:29,780
You guys are like speaking another language.

868
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:34,480
You could be...

869
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,360
You could literally be saying...

870
01:16:37,100 --> 01:16:40,720
You were saying English, but it looks like Chinese to me.

871
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:52,560
Magnets, how do they work?

872
01:16:52,740 --> 01:16:53,180
Seriously!

873
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:55,380
I'm literally...

874
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,580
Those guys right now!

875
01:16:56,660 --> 01:16:58,320
Put me in clown makeup right now!

876
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:09,460
Like It's just They're so far away That I have to press
these So I'm like so confused

877
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,380
And when I do this It's still stuck So I don't understand

878
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:29,040
Magnet on Then grab on for a second Then off right away Yeah
but with the magnet on They just stay up Yeah That's why I'm

879
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:29,720
so confused.

880
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,340
You say grab on off, but they don't do it.

881
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:33,360
It doesn't change anything.

882
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:39,740
That's why I'm confused.

883
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,700
Start with the boxes on the ground.

884
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:56,100
And then I do the magnet on.

885
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,460
And then I mess with the gravity.

886
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,140
Is that what I do?

887
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,570
Step one, both off.

888
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:10,670
Step two, magnet on.

889
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:12,470
Step three, turn grab on and off real quick.

890
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:14,030
My left unsealing.

891
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:18,070
Wait, my left is unsealing, but before right gets there.

892
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:23,690
How much time do I even have, then?

893
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:27,190
It's like the shortest amount of time.

894
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,110
Wait, because I need to jump onto this.

895
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:44,220
It's like boo-boo.

896
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:48,080
Oh!

897
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,540
I heard it.

898
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:54,480
Holy moly.

899
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:57,360
I thought...

900
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,740
Here's where my brain was like...

901
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:05,660
When you guys were like, you need to push the boxes or
whatever.

902
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:12,860
I was like, so I need to like turn this on and off so that
it like slightly shifts over so that I can come up here.

903
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,760
I was like, there's this gap over here.

904
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,380
So I thought I needed to be in the gap for some reason.

905
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,820
And I was like, I need to push this box up.

906
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:29,980
I needed to fit I was like wow how do I physically push that
box I'm just a weak kid I was like that seems like a really

907
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:42,520
heavy box how am I supposed to push it what's going on here
is that a lighthouse oh thank you guys I seriously don't

908
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:49,920
think I would have gotten it oh nothing gonna kill me or
okay

909
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:54,070
No!

910
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:55,150
Go back!

911
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,020
Grab it!

912
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,930
Okay, I get this one too.

913
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:16,210
We have to have it like swinging towards me.

914
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:22,640
Uh...

915
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:23,780
Nope.

916
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,500
No,

917
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,840
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

918
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:44,190
Okay.

919
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,480
He was like two...

920
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,600
Two little fingers away!

921
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,740
Oh wait, I think I didn't do it.

922
01:21:20,660 --> 01:21:21,120
Nope.

923
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,900
I didn't, I knew it, but I still tried for it.

924
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,600
It's fine because this was pretty easy to just...

925
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:29,320
Do over and over.

926
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,900
Yeah, we got this one.

927
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,440
Oh, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.

928
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,240
Oh, but the momentum.

929
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,000
Come on, come on.

930
01:21:58,220 --> 01:21:59,860
So close every time.

931
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:00,380
I know.

932
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:04,480
Grab it!

933
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,610
Oh, ee.

934
01:22:16,070 --> 01:22:17,570
This kid's got to work out.

935
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:21,730
I think we said the same exact thing last time.

936
01:22:23,290 --> 01:22:24,510
We said this kid.

937
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:31,540
No.

938
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:33,140
Wait.

939
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:33,800
Oh, shoot.

940
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,640
I gotta let it go.

941
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,680
Come on, come on.

942
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:44,800
It messes with your head, like the perspective.

943
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,400
And, oh my God, please.

944
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:47,740
Yes!

945
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,200
Ah!

946
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:59,570
I didn't see the spikes.

947
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,260
Oh

948
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:40,070
my god, now it's going to be another 10 years before I can
grab it again.

949
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,630
Oh.

950
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:55,400
Please.

951
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,700
Really stuck that landing.

952
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:05,320
Thank you.

953
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:05,920
Thank you.

954
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,160
Thank you.

955
01:24:08,180 --> 01:24:08,500
Thank you.

956
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:10,300
Did I just die?

957
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:20,940
Is it that rope that's down there?

958
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:24,100
Rope?

959
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:26,760
That?

960
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:27,080
Wait.

961
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,720
They caught it saved here.

962
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:31,060
I know.

963
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,340
The game.

964
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:40,400
is pretty forgiving in that regard i suppose wait the sign i
saw it but

965
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:49,860
all it says is right there's a button wait where do you guys
see the button

966
01:24:54,680 --> 01:24:56,420
Oh, the sign is a button.

967
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:00,880
Oh.

968
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:01,980
Oh.

969
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:10,710
Oh, my God.

970
01:25:10,790 --> 01:25:11,830
This one's going to be hellish.

971
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,830
Wait, this is terrifying.

972
01:25:15,210 --> 01:25:15,410
Wait.

973
01:25:15,970 --> 01:25:16,490
Oh, no.

974
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,230
Did I get electrocuted?

975
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:20,950
No way.

976
01:25:21,470 --> 01:25:22,630
I thought I missed it.

977
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,240
Oh, please!

978
01:25:28,900 --> 01:25:29,060
Okay.

979
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,040
Hey, where do I go from here though?

980
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:38,640
Maybe I fall back onto the sign?

981
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:40,340
Oh, I see!

982
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:43,520
There we go.

983
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:45,140
Okay, okay, okay.

984
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:47,320
I saw it.

985
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:52,030
Oh!

986
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,290
Okay, okay.

987
01:25:53,890 --> 01:25:54,570
Alright, alright.

988
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,990
I wasn't completely blind.

989
01:25:56,070 --> 01:25:57,630
I wasn't completely blind this time.

990
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:00,550
Wait, why did I do that?

991
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,430
Okay, uh, kid?

992
01:26:12,980 --> 01:26:14,840
She got a little confused, everybody.

993
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:16,380
Oh, I pressed the wrong button.

994
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:16,840
My button.

995
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:17,340
That's me.

996
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,440
That's me pressing jump instead of use.

997
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:25,640
Oh, that was too early.

998
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:26,340
Oh my gosh.

999
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:27,200
Oh my gosh!

1000
01:26:27,620 --> 01:26:28,200
We're okay!

1001
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,520
Everything's fine.

1002
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:35,860
Literal pinky toe.

1003
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:40,920
Alright.

1004
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,430
Okay, okay.

1005
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,340
Okay.

1006
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:57,940
Woo, we got it.

1007
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:58,740
We're fine.

1008
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,400
Everything's okay.

1009
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,140
Everything's cool.

1010
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,000
Everything's fine.

1011
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:09,160
All right.

1012
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,140
What could go wrong?

1013
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:15,840
Nothing.

1014
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:19,940
So why all of a sudden...

1015
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,180
Oh, this one has a timer?

1016
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,060
Okay.

1017
01:27:35,100 --> 01:27:37,200
If I fall, I die.

1018
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:40,140
Alright.

1019
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,340
Where do I bring you?

1020
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:48,160
What do I do with you?

1021
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:48,720
Oh, wait.

1022
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,160
I think I know what to do.

1023
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:51,820
Wait.

1024
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:55,880
Wait.

1025
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,300
Huh?

1026
01:27:58,280 --> 01:27:58,800
Oh.

1027
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:05,720
Oh.

1028
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:07,800
I pressed the wrong button.

1029
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:08,380
I go.

1030
01:28:08,840 --> 01:28:10,540
Stop torturing this poor boy.

1031
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,240
He should have...

1032
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:17,140
Man, I really should have paid attention and jam.

1033
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:20,740
Wait, please.

1034
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:21,380
Oh my gosh.

1035
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:23,360
It's like...

1036
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,860
We're going to get smushed in.

1037
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,130
Oh, whoops.

1038
01:28:43,220 --> 01:28:45,220
You can't move when you're dropping.

1039
01:28:45,340 --> 01:28:46,140
That's so mean.

1040
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,100
I was going to try and, like, press it again.

1041
01:29:01,560 --> 01:29:02,300
Okay, okay.

1042
01:29:15,340 --> 01:29:15,780
Oh!

1043
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,980
You have to do it three times, maybe?

1044
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:28,780
Might be a three-pressor.

1045
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:29,980
I think so.

1046
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:53,300
Holy cow.

1047
01:30:10,810 --> 01:30:11,310
Holy!

1048
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:18,640
I feel like we were so close.

1049
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:53,880
My bad.

1050
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:55,960
No, I have to start over.

1051
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:57,460
Evil!

1052
01:30:57,780 --> 01:30:58,660
Evil game!

1053
01:30:58,980 --> 01:30:59,500
Evil game!

1054
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:00,580
Evil game!

1055
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,300
Evil game!

1056
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:03,280
Wait.

1057
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:04,280
I'm stupid.

1058
01:31:04,540 --> 01:31:05,560
Oh, I messed up already.

1059
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:06,560
Team.

1060
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:07,460
It's over.

1061
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:12,780
It's so over for us.

1062
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:21,990
Okay.

1063
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:22,990
Okay.

1064
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,860
I don't know if I'll make this one either.

1065
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:34,840
Okay.

1066
01:31:35,060 --> 01:31:35,900
I made it.

1067
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:37,260
Okay.

1068
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,940
Wait, wait, wait!

1069
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:46,420
Oh, okay.

1070
01:31:46,820 --> 01:31:47,320
We're fine.

1071
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:48,080
Maybe?

1072
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:50,220
What is that all the way over there?

1073
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:52,700
There's like something here.

1074
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,580
What is this?

1075
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:56,220
Oh, shit.

1076
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:01,420
Thank you, checkpoint.

1077
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:02,580
For real, though.

1078
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,100
Checkpoint's a real one.

1079
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:10,800
Look at it.

1080
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:24,330
Wait, I timed.

1081
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:25,130
I mistimed it again.

1082
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:25,950
I mistimed it again.

1083
01:32:27,010 --> 01:32:27,770
Okay, okay.

1084
01:32:28,890 --> 01:32:30,630
Yeah, the timer is the BGM.

1085
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,690
Lock in.

1086
01:32:37,730 --> 01:32:38,210
I'm trying.

1087
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:49,560
Oh, wait.

1088
01:32:49,740 --> 01:32:50,260
Oh, please.

1089
01:32:50,580 --> 01:32:50,760
Wait.

1090
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:04,840
Oh, how do I do this?

1091
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:06,960
Wait, how do I do this?

1092
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:20,870
I think right before.

1093
01:33:24,670 --> 01:33:27,570
Oh, it almost saved me.

1094
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:34,180
Oh.

1095
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:39,140
You can't, like, move while you're falling, so it's kind of
tricky.

1096
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:45,570
Got it.

1097
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,750
Oh, shit.

1098
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:51,090
Ow.

1099
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:52,090
Damn it!

1100
01:33:52,190 --> 01:33:52,590
Damn it!

1101
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:53,810
Why didn't I go forward?

1102
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:54,770
I'm so stupid.

1103
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:56,430
Oh, okay, though.

1104
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:57,790
It put me back here.

1105
01:34:00,770 --> 01:34:01,090
Okay.

1106
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:02,830
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1107
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:10,390
Oh!

1108
01:34:11,430 --> 01:34:13,990
Okay, I have to jump there.

1109
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:14,770
Okay, got it.

1110
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:16,170
Oh

1111
01:34:22,620 --> 01:34:23,060
my god.

1112
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:24,780
This part's so intense!

1113
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:31,490
Oh!

1114
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:31,850
Oh!

1115
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:32,630
Ouch!

1116
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:47,720
Hit!

1117
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,560
Oh, come on!

1118
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:51,460
This game!

1119
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,120
Are you for real?

1120
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:56,860
No, stinking way.

1121
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:05,300
Oh my god.

1122
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:06,100
How the hell?

1123
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:06,620
Wait.

1124
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:07,820
What?

1125
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:08,740
What is this?

1126
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,420
It's okay if we really...

1127
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,340
Can I even keep going this way?

1128
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:20,340
I just wanted to try.

1129
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,420
I didn't think I would make it, but...

1130
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,680
It just keeps, I guess.

1131
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:30,920
I tried to undo it.

1132
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:32,220
I tried to click fast.

1133
01:35:33,860 --> 01:35:35,140
Gotta shoot the whoop?

1134
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:37,700
I'm a fire in my body!

1135
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:37,940
Oh!

1136
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,120
Did I make it?

1137
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:46,200
First try?

1138
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:01,160
Oh my god, am I dead?

1139
01:36:04,150 --> 01:36:04,770
Please, no.

1140
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,170
Imagine it's just like, okay, do it all over again.

1141
01:36:08,170 --> 01:36:09,870
Does the cutscene, but I actually died.

1142
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:19,120
Do a flute.

1143
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:02,410
Wait, what is over here now?

1144
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:12,180
Was that like the glass that I broke through?

1145
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:14,680
Was that like the windshield of a car or something?

1146
01:37:17,220 --> 01:37:18,740
That's why I'm in limbo.

1147
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,660
I died in a car accident.

1148
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,580
That's how I'm finally getting out of aperture science.

1149
01:37:38,740 --> 01:37:39,500
Thank you.

1150
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:42,540
Oh, the little girl.

1151
01:37:47,660 --> 01:37:48,720
We need MatPat.

1152
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:54,310
Hello.

1153
01:37:57,050 --> 01:37:59,570
Well, I say little girl, but...

1154
01:37:59,570 --> 01:38:00,690
Is that her hair or...

1155
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:01,390
Okay, that's her hair.

1156
01:38:09,470 --> 01:38:09,790
Oh.

1157
01:38:11,230 --> 01:38:11,770
Okay.

1158
01:38:11,790 --> 01:38:12,850
That's it?

1159
01:38:14,830 --> 01:38:15,790
She has a theory.

1160
01:38:16,190 --> 01:38:17,010
That's my theory.

1161
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:21,570
Yeah!

1162
01:38:21,790 --> 01:38:22,130
Wait!

1163
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:23,530
You guys!

1164
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:24,970
I beat the game!

1165
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:26,410
Wait!

1166
01:38:28,850 --> 01:38:33,250
I for some reason thought I had like another four hours of
this game.

1167
01:38:39,410 --> 01:38:40,630
A mint theory.

1168
01:38:40,730 --> 01:38:41,590
That's my theory.

1169
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:45,090
I thought we were gonna like see a car or something.

1170
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:49,510
And it'd be like, That's where I died.

1171
01:38:50,030 --> 01:38:50,510
Oh my god.

1172
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:51,010
William C.

1173
01:38:51,150 --> 01:38:51,990
Thank you so much for the podcast.

1174
01:38:52,170 --> 01:38:52,830
Thank you.

1175
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:59,850
There's always inside.

1176
01:39:00,050 --> 01:39:01,270
Is that the sequel?

1177
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:07,860
Another one added to the completed list.

1178
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:08,300
Yeah!

1179
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,480
I didn't think I would...

1180
01:39:11,480 --> 01:39:12,640
It had done so fast.

1181
01:39:14,660 --> 01:39:15,320
Let's go!

1182
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:23,340
It's very similar, but it's not a direct sequel.

1183
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,060
Oh, got it.

1184
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,280
Oh, where credit is due.

1185
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:27,720
its own reward.

1186
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:32,880
What are the chapters?

1187
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:38,220
Oh, I like the spider, though.

1188
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:44,700
The spider is so detailed.

1189
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,000
That's the thing about this game, too, is so detailed.

1190
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:49,520
Congrats on beating the game.

1191
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,300
Big brain ghost made gamer.

1192
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:57,260
There was that one puzzle that I absolutely did not
understand at all, that you guys helped me with but i feel

1193
01:39:57,260 --> 01:40:06,520
like i got everything else myself you can't win them all i
could never beat this game thank you for closure whoa thank

1194
01:40:06,520 --> 01:40:16,520
you eggie ben welcome back dorko thank you so much for the
pig it's totally unprepared for it to end there i know me

1195
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:23,100
too master timing and gravity gravity doing gravity felt
like half-life again

1196
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:28,700
Kodena, I think you're so much with the pod, good dude.

1197
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:30,400
How is she so good?

1198
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:33,440
Some of the puzzles stumped me for a while.

1199
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:37,660
Yeah, if I didn't have you guys, I'd be like...

1200
01:40:37,660 --> 01:40:39,540
I'd be...

1201
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:44,000
I'd just be sitting here like this, like...

1202
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:52,480
So...

1203
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,180
Thank you for helping me out.

1204
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:54,960
Thank you, thank you.

1205
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,040
I was seeing the bodies in the river was creepy.

1206
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:01,580
We're no more freaky kids, though.

1207
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:08,620
At least I saved Granny for her dementia, but keeping her
brain short.

1208
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,540
I would say I lived to see another day, but I'm already
gone.

1209
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:17,420
My brain...

1210
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:18,240
Oh, this one?

1211
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,700
I hated this one.

1212
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:23,560
This bug and trying to get that guy hated that part.

1213
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,150
We started.

1214
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:38,650
We started...

1215
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:41,690
Here...

1216
01:41:41,690 --> 01:41:41,950
No.

1217
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,070
I guess technically here?

1218
01:41:45,130 --> 01:41:45,370
No.

1219
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:49,810
It was like right after this, no?

1220
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:51,450
Right before the cart.

1221
01:41:51,630 --> 01:41:53,730
Yeah, for some reason it doesn't show in it.

1222
01:41:53,870 --> 01:41:54,750
Maybe it's a different chapter.

1223
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,430
So right in between here.

1224
01:41:57,030 --> 01:42:00,210
So I had like the littlest bit of the game left.

1225
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:11,170
there's an achievement where you need to beat the game
without dying more than five times well imagine if i got

1226
01:42:11,170 --> 01:42:17,910
that first try that would be crazy i don't think you can
though well not to say that you can't but like some of them

1227
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:26,950
some of these you need to die to know what to do congrats me
though to complete the game despite all the death count it

1228
01:42:26,950 --> 01:42:33,350
was great i'm happy for a great boss thank you thank you
some of you have to die to know how to complete the puzzle

1229
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:39,950
so they use dying as a teaching tool yeah so if you've never
played the game before of course you're gonna die a ton

1230
01:42:39,950 --> 01:42:49,810
congrats thank you oh my gosh qp 0 a l 0 z m 0 0 0 rf thank
you there's a well-known bug that causes the game to freeze

1231
01:42:49,810 --> 01:42:56,010
just as you pass through the barrier at the end which is
super annoying oh my gosh that would have been horrible but

1232
01:42:56,010 --> 01:43:00,890
at the same time what it's like go go youtube the ending
what's the ending

1233
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,420
I used to be able to one CC this, Dad, I could do it now.

1234
01:43:11,220 --> 01:43:11,900
That's crazy.

1235
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,880
But yeah, thank you guys for the help through some of these
puzzles.

1236
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:19,820
I do appreciate it, I do, but we are a team.

1237
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:21,620
So thank you very much.

1238
01:43:22,940 --> 01:43:23,740
What are you talking about?

1239
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:24,700
You beat it for a try.

1240
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:25,500
Yeah!

1241
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,420
God gamer!

1242
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,220
God gamer!

1243
01:43:30,380 --> 01:43:31,660
It was fun, though.

1244
01:43:32,420 --> 01:43:33,320
It was really fun.

1245
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:36,120
Like, it was just...

1246
01:43:36,120 --> 01:43:37,600
The game is very forgiving.

1247
01:43:38,680 --> 01:43:41,420
In that, like, there's many, many checkpoints.

1248
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:42,500
Usually.

1249
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:43,480
There were some points.

1250
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:48,460
I think there were some parts, especially in part one, that
I was like, I have to do all of this over again.

1251
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:50,820
But, for the most part, it was pretty forgiving.

1252
01:43:52,660 --> 01:43:53,080
And...

1253
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:56,020
And...

1254
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:57,900
I...

1255
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,740
Honorary Druid.

1256
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:02,740
Yeah, I think the checkpoints were well placed.

1257
01:44:02,860 --> 01:44:03,140
Yeah.

1258
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:11,260
few mean checkpoints yeah just a couple mean ones but most
of them are not so bad um especially towards the end they're

1259
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:21,720
like we know this part was annoying you don't have to do it
again it's all right um but i think the puzzles a lot of

1260
01:44:21,720 --> 01:44:28,620
them uh some of them were like really like oh my gosh my
brain is not expanded enough for this but some of them were

1261
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:30,640
like really clever so i like that

1262
01:44:36,740 --> 01:44:40,620
Where it was like a rage game, but not at the same time.

1263
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,860
Oh my gosh, I want to play Celeste.

1264
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:47,140
I feel like I could become a real gamer if I like actually
beat Celeste.

1265
01:44:51,120 --> 01:44:54,140
They were counting how many playtesters broke down in tears?

1266
01:45:00,710 --> 01:45:01,130
Why?

1267
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:04,670
Celeste is a gamer's game.

1268
01:45:04,870 --> 01:45:05,170
I know!

1269
01:45:06,290 --> 01:45:10,390
I feel like if I beat Celeste, I'd be able to be like, yeah,
I did it.

1270
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:12,270
I'm a gamer now, I'm a gamer.

1271
01:45:13,910 --> 01:45:17,030
That, Celeste is like, I'm going to say it.

1272
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:19,670
Celeste is the Dark Souls of Platform.

1273
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:21,350
No, just kidding.

1274
01:45:24,970 --> 01:45:26,610
Oh, arachnophobia, amazing.

1275
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:31,370
If you really are unsettled by spiders, this game is not
good.

1276
01:45:35,170 --> 01:45:35,990
so courageous.

1277
01:45:36,490 --> 01:45:39,970
I say what the people are afraid to speak out loud.

1278
01:45:44,730 --> 01:45:44,990
Jump King?

1279
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:46,550
No, that's a real rage game.

1280
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:49,950
That's a real rage game.

1281
01:45:50,450 --> 01:45:53,450
Just played Lego Island and got kicked twice by the skeleton
in the race.

1282
01:45:53,690 --> 01:45:55,710
I love... Robo, no!

1283
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:58,450
No!

1284
01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:04,790
The spider seemed oddly cute, though.

1285
01:46:05,310 --> 01:46:11,870
I think they made it more like like a black widow spider if
it looked like a tarantula spider it would have been very

1286
01:46:11,870 --> 01:46:15,850
cute do you guys understand what I mean

1287
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:38,620
no yes yeah tarantulas have like thicker thicker leggies and
they're very fuzzy and cute they're like they have like

1288
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:48,100
thicker these ones are like very thin and like they remind
me of the They're very, like, creepy, crawly.

1289
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:52,000
But, yeah, more chonka and fuzz.

1290
01:46:52,260 --> 01:46:53,300
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1291
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,760
Tarantulas are very cute.

1292
01:46:56,140 --> 01:46:58,660
But these guys were, like, very, like...

1293
01:46:58,660 --> 01:46:59,900
They, like, sound...

1294
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:00,420
Like, if they...

1295
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,960
If you could hear them, they sound like they would, like,
creak and crack.

1296
01:47:03,860 --> 01:47:04,460
You know what I mean?

1297
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:08,960
I tolerate spiders more than roaches and centipedes.

1298
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:10,660
Oh, I hate roaches.

1299
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,240
Guckiburi, yada.

1300
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:27,980
and Matorakan yeah spiders it depends on the spider for me I
suppose you know when I was a wee wisp though I loved like

1301
01:47:27,980 --> 01:47:36,520
playing with daddy long legs and stuff so I don't know I
don't like the spiders that jump but there's like a type of

1302
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:43,740
jumping spider that is very cute when you like watch videos
of it I love that one but if I saw that they're like very

1303
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:49,420
small right I don't like the small, jumpy ones that kind of
like lunge at you, you know, and like move erratically.

1304
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:53,640
How many more games for your goal before the month is over?

1305
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:55,100
Let's see, let's see.

1306
01:47:55,660 --> 01:47:56,560
Let's see.

1307
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:03,040
How many more games I need to complete before the month is
over?

1308
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:05,900
Another for the list.

1309
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,540
Want to decide my potluck fate tomorrow.

1310
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:11,300
Should I subject my friends to Italian seafood or cookies?

1311
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:12,620
Italian.

1312
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:13,240
Italian.

1313
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:14,300
Oh.

1314
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:15,560
Italian.

1315
01:48:16,220 --> 01:48:17,320
Because I want to be there.

1316
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:18,260
Oh, wait.

1317
01:48:18,380 --> 01:48:19,700

1318
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:20,840
Hold on.

1319
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:22,040
I'm counting it.

1320
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:25,140
I'm counting Lego Island.

1321
01:48:26,020 --> 01:48:28,400
And then 12, 13, 2025.

1322
01:48:33,030 --> 01:48:34,390
Seven more games.

1323
01:48:36,650 --> 01:48:37,830
We'll have missed.

1324
01:48:38,290 --> 01:48:40,710
But I probably, I don't think I'll beat it tomorrow.

1325
01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:42,470
But who knows, I might be super brained.

1326
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:44,130
I have missed.

1327
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:46,550
And then Barry and I will be finishing Battle Blades.

It's got three games.

1337
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:03,610
Yeah, but the first one would be...

1338
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:04,310
is pretty short.

1339
01:50:05,350 --> 01:50:07,290
I could always do the other two another time.

1340
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:08,990
Anonymous Agony.

1341
01:50:09,310 --> 01:50:11,550
I don't even know what that is.

1342
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:15,110
This is the song I used to fall asleep to for many years.

1343
01:50:15,230 --> 01:50:16,230
It's pretty relaxing.

1344
01:50:17,190 --> 01:50:19,530
But I'll figure... I'll figure out some games.

1345
01:50:20,690 --> 01:50:21,170
FNAF!

1346
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:27,430
No FNAF.

1347
01:50:27,730 --> 01:50:28,930
No, no FNAF.

1348
01:50:29,690 --> 01:50:30,270
No FNAF.

1349
01:50:33,650 --> 01:50:34,950
I'll figure it out.

1350
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:38,590
There's still many recommendations that people gave to me
already.

1351
01:50:42,130 --> 01:50:43,170
So, um...

1352
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:46,770
And if not, I'll just play things that I...

1353
01:50:46,770 --> 01:50:47,730
want to play.

1354
01:50:48,930 --> 01:50:51,670
Like, kind of how I did with Last Report and stuff like
that.

1355
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:52,470
So...

1356
01:50:54,270 --> 01:50:56,110
I missed Minto Cafe Shenan again.

1357
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:57,910
So here is the Apollo Super Chat.

1358
01:50:58,350 --> 01:50:59,330
Oh, Jeffrey!

1359
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:02,710
Don't even worry about it.

1360
01:51:03,390 --> 01:51:08,730

fine.

1364
01:51:17,690 --> 01:51:21,390

01:51:24,450 --> 01:51:25,010

01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:27,390

01:51:28,410 --> 01:51:29,270
So this is good.

1368
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:33,150
Anonymous Agni is ironically crazier than Mystery of the
Druids.

Whatever, you will have fun.

1378
