1
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,140
Three, two, one, swap.

2
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Why are you laughing?

3
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,620
What

4
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,560
did I say?

5
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,380
Nothing, nothing.

6
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,680
What did I say?

7
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,320
You've been dealing with this for years now.

8
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
Why now you laugh?

9
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,480
Nothing, nothing.

10
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,880
Hi guys.

11
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,720
Hey everybody.

12
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:40,340
So first off, I just want you guys to know, we were selling technical difficulties for at least 30 minutes.

13
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,140
Oh my god, we were so prepared.

14
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,160
Yeah, we were so prepared guys.

15
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:51,820
It was just very unfortunate that the last five minutes that we had, just something came up unexpectedly.

16
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,480
It was crazy.

17
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,720
It was so crazy.

18
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,800
Oh yeah, and it was on Min's side, not on mine.

19
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,580
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

20
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,760
I plead mac and cheese, you plead Germany.

21
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,000
What are you talking about?

22
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:19,540
Okay, look, the reason why I didn't start and Min started before me was because Dokkaebi, we had to connect to a special server to be there.

23
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,760
And I forgot I was connected to that special server.

24
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,780
So I was streaming over at Dokkaebi.

25
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,220
I was streaming over at Germany.

26
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:33,520
So someone out there was watching the starting screen in Germany and being like, where did this person come from?

27
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,680
It's like Grandpa Joe just trying to watch Jeopardy and he's like...

28
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,760
The worst part was the starting screen was not even playing.

29
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,200
It was just a still image.

30
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,420
So he must be freaking out right now and being like aliens or some shit.

31
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,260
How

32
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,630
do you say that in German?

33
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,290
What do you think I know German?

34
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,190
Well, you okay.

35
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,650
Miss invited to a German convention.

36
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,150
Look, I would say an European convention is a is a convention for all of EU.

37
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,410
Europe is not just German mint.

38
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,890
Wow.

39
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,550
Gotta open your mind.

40
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,810
It was in Germany.

41
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:26,210
Yeah, open your mind and be more inclusive to the other countries in Europe.

42
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,270
Okay.

43
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,610
Name every country in Europe.

44
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,150
All right.

45
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,190
European Union.

46
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,630
Who's not in the European Union?

47
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,670
Well, then they're not European.

48
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,310
Guys, that was a joke, guys.

49
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,330
That was a joke, everybody.

50
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,550
Wow.

51
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:55,350
And now she's lumping everyone in Europe under the European Union.

52
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,230
Wow.

53
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,170
No one can have individuality here.

54
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,350
Oh, yeah.

55
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,670
You name every country in Europe then.

56
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:08,050
I already asked you.

57
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:13,350
Yeah, but you're like, oh, you're ragging me on about my lack of European knowledge.

58
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,290
You think I know?

59
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:15,730
I don't know.

60
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,810
Then why are you ragging me?

61
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,410
I could have named random countries and you wouldn't know because you don't know Europe apparently.

62
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:21,850
Okay.

63
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,230
Name three countries and I'll tell you which one is real.

64
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,640
We're going to play that.

65
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,080
All right.

66
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,840
Give me a sec.

67
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,360
Oh, no.

68
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,420
She has to Google.

69
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
Give me a sec.

70
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:42,960
All right.

71
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,780
I also have Google.

72
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,300
You got to Google.

73
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,280
That's not knowing the answer if you're Googling.

74
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,420
I don't know.

75
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,280
All right.

76
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh, what are you Googling?

77
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:58,760
I'm googling, huh?

78
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,620
What are the countries of the world?

79
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,440
I googled nice things to send to my mom.

80
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,760
So you're not even prioritizing the stream.

81
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,240
I'm waiting on you, Dokie.

82
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,420
You're the one holding us up.

83
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
Okay, alright, alright.

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,480
Fine, fine.

85
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:19,880
Okay.

86
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,660
Peso.

87
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,320
Why are you laughing?

88
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,080
Wait, what?

89
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,540
Peso?

90
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah, Peso.

91
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,480
Malawi.

92
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,240
Eritrea.

93
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,160
Which one's the fake?

94
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,260
What's the third one?

95
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,460
Eritrea.

96
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,160
I would like to phone a friend.

97
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,780
You don't know either!

98
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,640
You don't know either!

99
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,080
They were all real!

100
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,300
They were all real!

101
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,540
They were all in Africa!

102
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,520
Please stop!

103
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:55,900
We said Europe!

104
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,280
You said you know every country in the world.

105
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,340
So I gave you every country in the world.

106
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,860
I gave you specific...

107
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,500
You don't know any African countries.

108
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,520
That's fucked up.

109
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,140
I know, I know some.

110
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,980
I know Zanzibar.

111
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:23,600
I gave you three and you couldn't even tell which one was the real one, but they were all real.

112
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,880
We said Europe!

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,780
Yeah, and then you went with countries in the entire world.

114
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,260
So I was like, entire world, huh?

115
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,360
Okay, entire world!

116
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,320
Oh my god, this is this is slander.

117
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,650
Oh my god.

118
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,450
Anyway, shall we play the game?

119
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,710
Okay.

120
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,570
I'm over playing GeoGuessr.

121
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,570
Alright, we'll play GeoGuessr now.

122
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,070
You're right.

123
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:56,090
I should have selected South America country.

124
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:02,730
Oh yeah, how many countries have you been to in South America?

125
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,190
Like...

126
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,290
zero?

127
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,190
I've been to one!

128
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,510
Yeah?

129
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,470
Which one was it?

130
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,030
Argentina!

131
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,750
Oh yeah.

132
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,610
Yeah, but you were there for like one second.

133
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:25,950
Does that really count?

134
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:31,930
No, I talked to the locals and they said, Papa Frita is so small.

135
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,130
That's all you got from it?

136
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,090
What even was the fucking context?

137
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,110
I was eating really small fries from McDonald's at the airport.

138
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:51,850
So they were like making fun of you?

139
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:53,210
Yeah.

140
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,630
She was like, I need to take a picture of this.

141
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,670
Eating the small fries.

142
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,430
So I turned up mid a little bit, guys.

143
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,550
I turned her up so you guys could hear her better.

144
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,370
It's not like she's giving us any good input or anything, but at least hear me.

145
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,470
I'm gonna send you to Brazil.

146
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:18,830
We're gonna go to Brazil together.

147
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,570
We're gonna go to Brazil, guys!

148
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,590
I don't care if men are coming to Brazil!

149
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,730
Brazil mentioned!

150
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:39,580
So apparently we found out that we can actually potentially kill people in this game.

151
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:45,340
And like, if any of that actually happens...

152
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,260
Wait, so if my characters die, do I just stop playing the game?

153
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,360
I think you just take over a different character.

154
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,140
Maybe?

155
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,300
I don't know.

156
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,980
We'll find out.

157
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,700
I guess we'll see when you kill off your character.

158
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,420
Also, there's QuickTime events, by the way.

159
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,500
Did you know that?

160
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,360
This is basically like Until Dawn.

161
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,100
My chat was like, oh, men and QuickTime events.

162
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,520
What's that supposed to mean?

164
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,060
I don't know.

165
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,680
I'm good at the QuickTime.

166
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,620
I wonder if I should play this with a controller.

167
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,420
Oh, cause I am.

168
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,100
Oh, you are?

169
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,240
Okay, I'm gonna grab my controller.

170
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,700
Yeah, I feel like this game is meant to be.

171
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,620
Until Dawn was meant to be played on a controller.

172
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,600
You're right.

173
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,460
Hold on.

174
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,320
Okay, I'm good.

175
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,460
Isn't this the creators of Until Dawn?

176
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,460
I'm pretty sure.

177
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,300
I think so.

178
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,180
Yeah, so it was meant to play.

179
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,040
Alright, you guys ready?

180
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,640
New slot.

181
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,780
Oh, I want to be Joe or Charlie.

182
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,260
Guys, which one has a higher chance of living?

183
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,720
Oh.

184
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,560
Joe.

185
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,300
Joe Schmo.

186
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,940
Joe Schmo?

187
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,620
Charlie Warley?

188
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,340
Charlie Warley.

189
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,440
Joey.

190
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,220
He believes in the heart of the cards.

191
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,140
Okay.

192
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:05,960
Oh, you're right.

193
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,720
I'm gonna be Joe.

194
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,500
I identify with Joey.

195
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,700
Just kidding.

196
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,500
Joey's a wimp.

197
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm ready.

198
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:14,880
I'm ready.

199
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,560
I'm ready, Charlie.

200
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,680
I am your Charlie.

201
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,600
It says it right there on the screen.

202
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
For now.

203
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:28,680
Okay.

204
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,880
Alright, here we go.

205
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,460
Wait.

206
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,080
To play with a controller, press E.

207
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,200
Okay, that's cool.

208
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,500
That'd be funny if we were like, you can only play with one.

209
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,240
The other has to do M and K.

210
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,480
Oh my god.

211
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,840
That would be torture.

212
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,320
Man of Medan.

213
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,160
Medan?

214
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,580
Medan?

215
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,080
Medan?

216
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,960
What is it?

217
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,340
You don't know either.

218
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,060
I think it's Medan.

219
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,660
Right?

220
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,260
I think it's Medan.

221
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,300
Okay, to be fair, everybody knows I pronounce things wrong 99% of the time.

222
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,380
That's gonna be you.

223
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,520
That's gonna be you in that box.

224
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh wait, in the box it did!

225
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,980
I know, that's what I'm saying.

226
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:08,960
That's it.

227
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:11,860
Woo.

228
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,090
Elvis Presley.

229
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,150
I bet like...

230
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,830
Oh my god.

231
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,690
Are we coming back from the war?

232
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,730
I guess so.

233
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,070
What war though?

234
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,670
There's a lot.

235
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,570
In America.

236
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,350
I don't know.

237
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,390
There's so many choices.

238
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,130
You know this is based on like a real ship, right?

239
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:34,610
Wait, it is?

240
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,270
Wait, this is based off real life?

241
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,710
Yeah, they found a ship that like, everybody died on.

242
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:40,850
Oh.

243
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,770
And they couldn't figure out why they all died.

244
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,050
Doki Bird is Joe.

245
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,650
That's what it said in the corner.

246
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:50,770
That's right.

247
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,990
The director called me up to act on this movie.

248
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:54,790
Game.

249
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,790
That's you, Charlie!

250
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,330
Well, I'm wasted.

251
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,530
Yeah, you're so drunk.

252
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,910
Oh no, Charlie.

253
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,810
There's no subtitles.

254
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,970
Oh yeah, you turn it on yourself.

255
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,850
I turn mine on.

256
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,190
Guys, I have subtitles.

257
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,030
Guys, I have subtitles.

258
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,410
Wait, how do I turn it on?

259
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,670
I guess we'll find...

260
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:16,490
You'll have to find out after this scene.

261
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:17,630
Okay.

262
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:19,630
Where is...

263
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,630
I have subtitles.

264
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,550
Look it, she's hot.

265
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,590
Oh my god, he's fighting that thing.

266
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,830
Kick his ass.

267
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,750
Oh wait, this is me!

268
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:31,470
Oh my god.

269
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,210
Punch!

270
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,790
R to aim, R T to punch.

271
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,950
What do I punch?

272
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,310
This thing?

273
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,490
Use R to choose.

274
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:42,750
Can I like move it for you?

275
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,610
Oh, I can.

276
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,470
You can?

277
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,530
Yeah.

278
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:47,310
Can I move it?

279
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,270
Wait, I am moving it.

280
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,150
No, I'm moving it.

281
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:54,050
This is totally me.

282
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,230
You're not?

283
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,810
Okay.

284
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,710
I wanna know...

285
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,910
Oh my god, me!

286
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,930
Wait, how do I pick?

287
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:03,730
Oh my god.

288
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:06,250
I'm killing it.

289
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:06,830
I'm killing it.

290
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,730
What are you doing?

291
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,070
I'm doing QTEs.

292
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,510
Oh, we're doing different things.

293
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,150
Why can't I pick?

294
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,310
Cause... oh.

295
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,670
Why'd you pause the game?

296
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,550
Don't you have to...

297
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,510
Go do your fucking settings.

298
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:24,350
Yeah, hold on.

299
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,090
I'm doing my subtitles.

300
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,830
Oh, you're actually doing it?

301
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,150
Yeah.

302
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,190
Yeah, I'm doing my subtitles.

303
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:31,890
Okay, we're good.

304
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,690
Continue.

305
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:33,930
I'm ready.

306
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,150
Okay.

307
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,270
Four, three, two, one.

308
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,910
You threw off my groove.

309
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,230
Wait, you're fighting?

310
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,510
Yes, I'm fighting!

311
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,030
Wait, I can't press anything!

312
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,390
Wait!

313
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,430
You should've picked Charlie.

314
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,610
You should've picked Charlie.

315
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,390
Yeah, I didn't turn you up anyway.

316
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,610
This gives me a chance to turn you up.

317
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,230
Oh my god.

318
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,670
I'm continuing the game.

319
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:57,110
I want to pick!

320
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,130
I'm pressing B!

321
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,230
Yeah, it's my QTEs!

322
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,010
What's R?

323
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,250
It's not letting me pick!

324
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,610
I swear I'm pressing everything!

325
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,910
Yeah, because I'm the one who's playing!

326
00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:14,890
No, I have my own screen!

327
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:18,250
I have my own screen!

328
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,810
I don't know what's going on on your side!

329
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,010
I'm playing the game!

330
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,750
It's not letting me pick!

331
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,250
I'm pressing everything!

332
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,350
You suck at the game!

333
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,110
I already beat it!

334
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:32,710
Oh, I said nothing.

335
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,110
Oh, you're already done?

336
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,630
Yes, I didn't say anything.

337
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,970
Wait, were you playing a game of cards or something?

338
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:44,430
I was trying to do the dialogue section if I couldn't pick a dialogue.

339
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:45,890
What do I look like?

340
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,690
I was gaming.

341
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,870
And you were dying to some old man who's asleep.

342
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,610
What do I got coming my way?

343
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,210
Oh wait, now I have to do the thing you just did.

344
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,110
Oh, you were doing this.

345
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,710
Um...

346
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,850
Were you able to pick a dialogue?

347
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,970
You have this?

348
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,350
Are you freaking out?

349
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,730
I picked it!

350
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,770
I picked a thing.

351
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:11,510
What did you press?

352
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,030
You just move with R.

353
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,170
Yeah, but how did you select it?

354
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,870
Oh, I'm going to use the rooster tile.

355
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,230
You just hover over it.

356
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,350
You just hover over it?

357
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,170
That's all you did?

358
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,450
Guys, you're wrong too.

359
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,990
It wasn't just press R.

360
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,010
You just hover.

361
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,190
Oh, wait.

362
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,390
I didn't pick it up.

363
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,870
Oh my god, I don't know anything about my son!

364
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,210
What about my son?

365
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,050
I don't think you'll never know.

366
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,110
I think you're dead.

367
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:57,690
I'll never know about my son or if I'll ever be rich.

368
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,470
I just did nothing.

369
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,990
I feel like it's hard to balance the audio in this.

370
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,150
He's told me like...

371
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,150
Blood?

372
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:11,630
Blood?

373
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:12,410
Huh?

374
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,190
Oh, are you done?

375
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,390
Yeah, I'm done.

376
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,250
You don't need to know anything more about your future.

377
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,550
If I don't know my future, you don't know your future.

378
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,790
Did you beat the dummy?

379
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:23,810
Yeah, I beat the dummy.

380
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,230
I did it faster than you.

381
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,850
Did you get hit?

382
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,950
No.

383
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:29,910
I don't believe you.

384
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,270
No, I did not!

385
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,570
Did you get hit on the QuickTime events?

386
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,010
No.

387
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,130
If anybody's dying, it's on your side.

388
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:41,850
No, I got an achievement for it.

389
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,470
I got an achievement.

390
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,710
I think all of us get an achievement for finishing it.

391
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,470
Oh, shit.

392
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,330
The death box.

393
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,350
That's gonna be you.

394
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:58,070
I mean, judging by the QuickTime events stuff, I think it's you.

395
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,670
Don't write death POV.

396
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:05,850
Me?

397
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:07,170
I might not make right dialogue.

398
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,930
See, we got our strengths.

399
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,870
I'm the QuickTime event person, and you're the dialogue person.

400
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,710
Wait, why are there three boxes of death?

401
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,370
Wait, who's the third person?

402
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,370
Uh-oh, it's chat.

403
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,810
It's chat.

404
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,930
Wait, one of our chats survives.

405
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:21,450
Uh-oh.

406
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,850
Oh, who's that guy?

407
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,120
Where's my 50 cents?

408
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,300
Yeah, I was like, what 50 cents?

409
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,380
Come on, chat.

410
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,640
Mitch, you don't need 50 cents.

411
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,420
You stole my 50 cents.

412
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,220
Oh, that's the third guy.

413
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,260
No, that was you.

414
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,680
You just got punched by a dude.

415
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,680
The

416
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,820
audio is like so...

417
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,660
Why is it so loud, but he's so quiet?

418
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:52,820
Yeah, I know.

419
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,860
Why is the sound effect so loud?

420
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,160
Why are you dead already?

421
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,640
Come on, don't keep it up.

422
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,880
You're the drunk one.

423
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,360
You are too.

424
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,300
You got punched in the face.

425
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,020
You hit me for fucking 50 cents and then I got punched?

426
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,140
Like...

427
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,140
Guys, it's not the game voice that's low.

428
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,820
It's the...

429
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,500
It's everything else is high.

430
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
Yeah, I think that, yeah.

431
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,920
I keep trying to like adjust it, but it's like all over the place.

432
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:21,960
Okay.

433
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,360
Uh-oh.

434
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,220
Oh, there's the ship.

435
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,160
Whoa!

436
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,000
Oh, no.

437
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,000
What the fuck?

438
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,260
Titanic moment.

439
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,140
It struck...

440
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:36,300
Oh!

441
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,480
What is that?

442
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,460
That's some ghoul.

443
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,180
The death is leaking into the water.

444
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:43,880
Yeah.

445
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,060
Oh, no.

446
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,100
Frankenstein.

447
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,580
Do you guys know that Frankenstein...

448
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:57,120
The reason his arms are stuck out is because he was supposed to be blind and they just wrote that out of the story, but kept his arms sticking out.

449
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,620
It's kind of messed up.

450
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,520
Um, it's Frankenstein's monster.

451
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,860
Whatever.

452
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,280
Um...

453
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,580
Actually...

454
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,680
If you're gonna give a fact about Frankenstein...

455
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,200
Frankenstein's monster.

457
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,360
What the fuck?

458
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:21,880
Whoa!

459
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,300
What's going on?

460
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,820
I'm in the bridge.

461
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,880
This is Charlie.

462
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,520
Oh, no.

463
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:30,680
Oh, wait.

464
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:31,680
That's me.

465
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,740
Yeah, you're looking at yourself.

466
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
Oh, yeah, I'm looking at myself.

467
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,640
Wait, where are you?

468
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,740
Wait, where are you?

469
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,380
I'm at the sickbay.

470
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:38,780
Why'd you pause?

471
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,700
Because I didn't just see audio!

472
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,980
The audio is fucked up!

473
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,980
You're right, you're right, you're right.

474
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,480
I'm putting the sound effects and the music down.

475
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,580
We do not need such high sound effects.

476
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,360
No, I'm gonna put it, like, 70.

477
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm gonna put it at 72, yeah.

478
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:53,940
See?

479
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,880
You're welcome.

480
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,540
What is audio preset?

481
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,760
I don't know.

482
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,280
Oh, never mind.

483
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,260
Alright, I turned down music and the sound effects.

484
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:05,720
Are you ready?

485
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,900
Hold on.

486
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,260
Alright, fine, you press continue then.

487
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,060
I'm pressing continue.

488
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,810
Did you press continue?

489
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,510
Oh, I pressed continue.

490
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,450
Yeah, I waited too long, so now I'm adjusting again.

491
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,030
Oh, fuck.

492
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,510
Okay.

493
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,730
Okay, now you can press continue.

494
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,390
I already did.

495
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,230
Alright, there we go.

496
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,830
Three, two, one.

497
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,250
I guess people can use, like, the settings thing to fuck each other over.

498
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,550
Whoa, there's blood on the wall.

499
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,010
Wait, there's blood?

500
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,190
Oh, wait, I got the med kit.

501
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,370
Don't worry, I got you.

502
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,150
Okay.

503
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,010
It's not my blood.

504
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,030
Call an ambulance, but not for me.

505
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,230
Okay, I know where the blood came from.

506
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,650
I know where the blood came from.

507
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,450
Yeah, there's text that's on the, um, right side.

508
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,210
What a dick.

509
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,970
Okay, I know where the blood came from.

510
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:01,070
Okay, hold on.

511
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,690
I'm paused.

512
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,590
Sorry.

513
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,010
I'm moving us over, I'm moving us over, I'm moving us over.

514
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,310
Chat, come over here, Chat.

515
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,530
That's not a med kit.

516
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,490
Chat, come here.

517
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,690
Chat, come here.

518
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,690
Oh, you guys are, like, censored to...

519
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,110
Oh, gosh.

520
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:16,510
Okay.

521
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,150
You guys, don't worry about it.

522
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,470
Okay, sorry.

523
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:28,190
Five, four, three, two, one.

524
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:28,910
Five, four, three, two, one.

525
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:29,070
Five, four, three, two, one.

526
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,110
There's a dead body on my side.

527
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,210
Um, there's just blood on the wall here.

528
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:33,630
Let's see.

529
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,070
Oh, I'm looking at a key.

530
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,470
Whoa, what a key.

531
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,470
I have a key.

532
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,550
I'm just looking at blood.

533
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,990
Come get me out of here then, maybe.

534
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,750
Maybe that's for me to get out.

535
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,550
I need to see... wait, it's a doctor.

536
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,250
Is he dead?

537
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,730
There's a dead... yes.

538
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,430
I'm pretty sure he was stuffed in the locker.

539
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,750
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

540
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,270
Private Charles Anderson.

541
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:57,950
What happened?

542
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,890
Wait, what happened while I was sleeping?

543
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:00,950
Oh.

544
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,090
Oh, we were both sleeping.

545
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,290
Ten days approved.

546
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:05,930
Yeah, what the heck happened?

547
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,130
To Pops, come back soon.

548
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,930
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we weren't sleeping for that long.

549
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,210
Nah.

550
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,790
I'm opening up...

551
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,350
Do you have a safe code?

552
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,630
I'm opening up a lock.

553
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,350
I'm coming out.

554
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,250
I'm coming out of the ship.

555
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,290
Out of the ship?

556
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,410
Where are you?

557
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:24,450
I'm outside the ship now.

558
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,750
Okay, I don't like how you don't know what's going on.

559
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,910
I'm stuck in the brig.

560
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,530
Oh my gosh, this is tank...

561
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,890
Oh, it's Resident Evil.

562
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,470
I'm stuck in the brig.

563
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,150
The brig?

564
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,530
Something's gonna pop out at me.

565
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,290
Wait, is that you?

566
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,370
Are you in this side?

567
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:43,910
Yeah, that's me!

568
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,330
That's you, Charlie!

569
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,830
Just get me out of here already.

570
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,270
Oh, you were in detention for punching me.

571
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,650
I didn't punch you!

572
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,430
Oh yeah?

573
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,810
Why were you locked inside?

574
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:56,710
I don't know.

575
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,090
Of course.

576
00:25:59,090 --> 00:25:59,610
Something's wrong.

577
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,950
Let's get out of here.

578
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,890
What are these guys looking at?

579
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,110
What is happening?

580
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,390
Find out what's happening on this ship.

581
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,870
Where are we gonna go?

582
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,490
Where are we gonna go?

583
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,330
I don't know.

584
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,110
This way, this way, this way.

585
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,850
I don't know.

586
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,030
Don't you hear it?

587
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,710
I don't know.

588
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,670
I'm stuck in the wall.

589
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:25,890
This way, this way.

590
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,850
Go, Charlie.

591
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,150
Go, my heart.

592
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,490
Oh, what's that?

593
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,430
I don't know.

594
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:33,210
Run!

595
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:34,670
Oh, God.

596
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,610
That's gonna be you.

597
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,130
What's that?

598
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:43,870
Oh.

599
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,770
Press A in time with a heart beat?

600
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:45,990
Okay.

601
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:49,050
If you don't get this right, I swear to God.

602
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,310
You fucked up!

603
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,050
You fucked up!

604
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,950
I swear to God!

605
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,430
I swear to God!

606
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,670
You fucked me!

607
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,470
We were fine!

608
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,470
We were fine!

609
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,910
Where did we come from?

610
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:12,470
Where did we go?

611
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,570
Where did we go?

612
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,970
Where did we come from?

613
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,810
Oh, wait.

614
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:19,630
This is where we came from.

615
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,030
Turn around.

616
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,910
We're just two bumbling guys.

617
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:28,150
Charlie and Joe.

618
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,810
The adventures of Charlie and Joe.

619
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,370
What is this?

620
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,590
How did you mess up that?

621
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,630
You just pressed A!

622
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:40,770
I wanted to see what would happen if he caught us.

623
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:43,190
Yeah, you wanted to see what would happen.

624
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,510
He didn't shoot us.

625
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:44,950
It's fine.

626
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,970
He was safe.

627
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,050
He was safe.

628
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,530
Okay.

629
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,170
What the hell?

630
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,290
I'm speaking.

631
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:53,750
Oh, wait.

632
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:53,930
Hold on.

633
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,870
I'm gonna put settings up right now, okay?

634
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,330
Get ready.

635
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,390
I need to turn you up again.

636
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:58,810
Okay.

637
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:01,310
Settings time.

638
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,610
Actually, this works for me.

639
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,390
I need to fix it.

640
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,410
Okay, we both need to fix it, so that's fine.

641
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,790
Okay.

642
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,150
I turned my sound effects to 60.

643
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,470
Why is the sound effects so loud?

644
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:14,110
I don't know.

645
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,990
Actually, I'm gonna turn mine down a little bit, too.

646
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:16,870
Yeah.

647
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,870
Okay, I'm gonna turn you up a little bit.

648
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:23,450
And I'm turning the overall game a little bit.

649
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:24,030
60.

650
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:25,170
Alright.

651
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:25,930
Okay.

652
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:26,730
This should work.

653
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,070
Is this A Way Out or whatever that game is?

654
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,430
Well, it feels like it.

655
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,130
It's like the horror version of A Way Out.

656
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,450
Sorry, chat.

657
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,730
You're cut off a little bit.

658
00:28:40,850 --> 00:28:41,470
Sorry, guys.

659
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,110
Alright, here.

660
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:44,610
I'm ready.

661
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,030
Are you ready?

662
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,710
Yeah.

663
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,090
I already clicked ready.

664
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,030
Okay.

665
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:48,930
I don't know that.

666
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:49,630
I can't see.

667
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:52,890
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

668
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,410
Okay.

669
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:54,710
Here we go.

670
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,410
We're walking down the hall.

671
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:56,870
We're fine.

672
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:57,370
Everything's good.

673
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,570
Wait.

674
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:57,990
Where did you go?

675
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:58,790
Oh, there you are.

676
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,890
Didn't we come here?

677
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,770
What was that?

678
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,210
What was that, Joe?

679
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,190
Did you not see it?

680
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:06,790
Poor Joe.

681
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,230
Did you not see Charlie?

682
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,810
Did you not see the guy running in front of us?

683
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:10,190
No.

684
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:10,830
There was no guy.

685
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:12,010
Wait.

686
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:12,810
Oh, no.

687
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,570
What's going on?

688
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,270
What are you talking about?

689
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:17,150
Charlie, I think I'm so drunk.

690
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,430
Joe, take your meds.

691
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,170
Joe, take your meds.

692
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:20,710
Joe.

693
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,730
I couldn't.

694
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:22,450
The doctor's dead.

695
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:24,550
There's a door flashing over here.

696
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:24,650
Yeah.

697
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:25,310
Over here.

698
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:25,690
Over here.

699
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,170
Why are our feet smelly?

700
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:29,850
Ew.

701
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,350
Wait.

702
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,050
Do you not see?

703
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,530
There's like a flashing over here.

704
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:34,810
Yeah.

705
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:34,810
Get it.

706
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:34,910
Get it.

707
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,090
I'm getting it.

708
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:36,710
Come on, Joe.

709
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,010
Yeah.

710
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:39,550
Help me.

711
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,790
I just came back from the sickbay.

712
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,670
Why is my face just so...

713
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,410
Alright.

714
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:44,650
Oh.

715
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:45,590
A.

716
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,450
Okay.

717
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,190
I'm pressing A repeatedly.

718
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:48,990
Pressing A repeatedly.

719
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:50,770
Yeah.

720
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:51,250
He's dead.

721
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,130
Yeah.

722
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:52,970
You said it.

723
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,710
Fubar and then some.

724
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,310
What the fuck?

725
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,150
Fubar and then some.

726
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,170
What does that even mean?

727
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,930
What does that mean?

728
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,130
Oh, my God.

729
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,010
Oh, that's a lot of blood.

730
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:06,910
Are we getting invaded?

731
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,750
What's happening?

732
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,390
What happened on the ship?

733
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,650
Stays on the ship.

734
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:11,810
Oh.

735
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:12,370
Okay.

736
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,170
I'm first, I guess.

737
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,310
Yeah.

738
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,510
Even though I opened the door?

739
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:15,850
Yeah.

740
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,970
Our feet are really smelly.

741
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:18,130
Wait.

742
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:19,950
Why is there, like, gas on the floor?

743
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:20,570
That's what I'm saying.

744
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,290
We're smelly.

745
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:21,430
Go.

746
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:25,730
I'm checking him out.

747
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,950
I'm trying to check him out.

748
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,450
Wait.

749
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,550
I'm stuck.

750
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,310
I'm stuck.

751
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:29,750
I can't.

752
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,270
Oh, there it is.

753
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,650
What's going on?

754
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,790
What's going on?

755
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:35,490
He looks like Peter Griffin.

756
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,270
Wait.

757
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,150
I want to see, too.

758
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:38,930
What the fuck?

759
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,590
Oh, my God.

760
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,030
It's him.

761
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:44,290
Wait.

762
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,410
What's wrong with his eyes?

763
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,390
He's, like, looking.

764
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,750
He's, like, blank eyes.

765
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:48,330
Yeah.

766
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,350
Let's go this way.

767
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,210
What's going on, guys?

768
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,030
There's nothing this way.

769
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,090
We gotta go through the door.

770
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,230
I feel like those, like, the frat boys be like, hey, guys.

771
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,070
What's going on?

772
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:58,630
What's going on?

773
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,970
What do we do?

774
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:02,990
Wow.

775
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,350
Look at these camera angles.

776
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,050
So cinematic.

777
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,010
Oh, you went through that door?

778
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,130
I can't see anything.

779
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:08,670
Where are you?

780
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,910
I'm heading downstairs.

781
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:10,490
Okay.

782
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,170
Oh, my God.

783
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:11,890
It is so cinematic.

784
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,870
I can't see where I'm going.

785
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,490
Do I just go straight?

786
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:20,490
Fubar is a military snap for fucked unbelievably beyond all recognition.

787
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:21,410
Whoa.

788
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:22,910
Oh, you can LB.

789
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:23,270
Oh, my God.

790
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:24,110
To walk faster.

791
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,670
To walk faster.

792
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,310
Okay.

793
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:25,750
Yeah.

794
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:26,150
I like that.

795
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:26,870
Okay.

796
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,830
All right.

797
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,070
Now we can... Can we run?

798
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,810
I don't feel like I'm walking very much.

799
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,310
Me, too.

800
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,190
I feel like...

801
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,390
I don't think I'm walking that fast.

802
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,090
Me, either.

803
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,590
Maybe we're not pressing the right button.

804
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,150
It's LB.

805
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:42,670
I don't know.

806
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:43,430
It's just...

807
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:44,510
Maybe it's wrong.

808
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,730
Which one is me?

809
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,110
I'm the one... Oh, this is me.

810
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:49,530
Whoa.

811
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,710
Did you not see that?

812
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,430
No, I didn't see anything.

813
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,050
Oh, it's only me.

814
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:56,930
It was a child.

815
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,870
Are you feeling all right?

816
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,850
Joe, what's wrong with you?

817
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,110
Of course, you, Doki, would be the one.

818
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,890
You would be the one.

819
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,950
To go crazy.

820
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,050
So you're walking in circles.

821
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:09,370
You're just like, I don't know.

822
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,570
I don't know, Charlie.

823
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,750
I don't feel so good.

824
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,670
I don't feel so good, Charlie.

825
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,190
I'm seeing children.

826
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,390
I'm seeing children.

827
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:18,790
Oh.

828
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,070
Oh.

829
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,010
Oh, my God.

830
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:24,970
Go, go, go.

831
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,550
Uh-oh.

832
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:28,410
Is that a good idea?

833
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:30,370
Oh, why did I grab a knife?

834
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,790
What the hell?

835
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,650
Why can't I ever have a gun?

836
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,330
You know why.

837
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,790
This is accurate.

838
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,410
This is very accurate.

839
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,890
Why can't I ever have a gun?

840
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,030
You were meant to have the katana.

841
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,750
The katana.

842
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,250
I don't think you...

843
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:53,410
I don't think you...

844
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,330
You are having hallucinations.

845
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,010
I don't think you should be holding anything.

846
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,050
I don't think you should be holding anything.

847
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:01,650
Is that you?

848
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,050
Is that you?

849
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,230
That's me.

850
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,550
I saw another child.

851
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,230
I saw a child again.

852
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:12,290
What the fuck do you see on your screen?

853
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,570
What the fuck do you see on your screen?

854
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,670
The dead people are actually talking to me right now.

855
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,470
The dead people are actually talking to me right now.

856
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,930
Oh, what?

857
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,710
What is happening?

858
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,250
It's you talking to me.

859
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:25,990
But you're dead.

860
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:26,350
Wait, what?

861
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,810
Yeah, you're looking at me.

862
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:29,930
But you're dead.

863
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,670
I'm going to investigate.

864
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,170
Wait, how do I investigate?

865
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,050
Oh, there we go.

866
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,650
How are you investigating?

867
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,650
I'm still hallucinating.

868
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,530
I'm investigating your body.

869
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:43,310
Oh, there's a man here.

870
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,410
Wait, there's me.

871
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,190
No, I think you're the man.

872
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,150
Wait, what?

873
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,490
No child!

874
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,830
The child has your knife!

875
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,290
You gave the child the knife!

876
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,370
No, I still have it!

877
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,810
I shot the child!

878
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,850
Oh my god, he's a zombie!

879
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,630
I missed!

880
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,570
How could you miss?

881
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,870
Are you shooting me?

882
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,710
I don't know, but I missed apparently.

883
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,410
Where did I die from that?

884
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,430
I think I'm dead too.

885
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:22,790
This guy used the force on me and killed me.

886
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,450
I tried...

887
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:29,070
I missed the child and then I died from a heart attack.

888
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:36,770
You died from cringe because you were so bad.

889
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,390
You died of cringe, real.

890
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,770
Hello, can anyone out there hear me?

891
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,790
Who is he?

892
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,590
Of course not Charlie or Joe.

893
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,910
Give us your location, do it!

894
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,650
Do it, man!

895
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,670
You're our only hope!

896
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,990
Random sailor!

897
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:55,610
Uh oh.

898
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:56,850
Uh oh.

899
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:58,970
Wait, what?

900
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,910
He has four arms!

901
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,650
Doki, I think something weird is going on here.

902
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:07,010
Yeah, I don't think that...

903
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,390
I think that shit might be haunted.

904
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:11,050
He's got his little baby cross.

905
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,850
God cannot save you now!

906
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:17,950
Whoa!

907
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,010
Oh, he's...

908
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,510
He's dead!

909
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,690
Oh my god, he's dead!

910
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,710
Oh my god, she died of cringe too!

911
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,170
Everybody's dying of cringe!

912
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,350
Oh my god, it's so loud.

913
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,710
I cannot...

914
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:36,530
I like how they were like, picked between Joe and Charlie and they're already dead.

915
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:39,390
Yeah, that was the prologue.

916
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,030
We get the prologue.

917
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,490
We get the whole... we get the game now.

918
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,460
This isn't the ship we're at a mansion now.

919
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,580
Do they still make these games?

920
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,140
I don't know.

921
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,660
I know they're doing really bad right now.

922
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,360
You know what?

923
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,300
I saw the reviews for it.

924
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:13,920
Fair.

925
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,620
The newer episodes were not doing so well.

926
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,000
Uh oh.

927
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,980
Who's this guy?

928
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,340
Isn't he the guy that was the psychiatrist in Until Dawn?

929
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,560
Oh, is he?

930
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
I think so.

931
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,340
Oh, apparently we're gonna get a copyright strike because of this song.

932
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,660
I'm turning it down.

933
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,020
It's okay, they're just gonna get our ad money.

934
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,780
That's alright.

935
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,060
Alright.

936
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,860
Look at this.

937
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,080
The ring girl.

938
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,200
What is going on?

939
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,640
Why is she there?

940
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,400
Is this like some paranormal activity?

941
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,980
Is this like the video game version of the Annabelle ship?

942
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,000
Probably.

943
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,700
What were they called?

944
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,620
They had names.

945
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,200
They were like a couple that investigated paranormal activities.

946
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,300
Anne and Lorraine Warren or whatever.

947
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,240
Yeah, yeah.

948
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,280
What was the name of those movies called?

949
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,980
Wasn't it just Annabelle, right?

950
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,600
No, they had a name.

951
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,640
There was a series.

952
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,840
The Conjuring.

953
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

954
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,600
Insidious?

955
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,420
Oh, yeah, yeah.

956
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,320
We're the Conjuring.

957
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,160
We're the Conjuring.

958
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,880
Joe and Charlie.

959
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,620
Charlie, who died.

960
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,480
Walking down his own hallway so dramatically.

961
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,260
Yeah.

962
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,020
Oh, now he's lighting candles.

963
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,080
Hello.

964
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,300
Is the sound on?

965
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:50,700
And welcome.

966
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,160
Yeah, thank you.

967
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,320
To my repository.

968
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,780
Okay.

969
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,660
Okay.

970
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,820
His suppository?

971
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,760
Is that the things you stick up your ass?

972
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,600
I think so.

973
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:09,920
If you're wondering why I know this, guys, it's because I watch a lot of doctor shows.

974
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,020
Yeah, that's the only reason she knows.

975
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,740
That's the only reason I know.

976
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,600
Then why do you know it, huh?

977
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,540
The curator of stories.

978
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,200
Stories of love.

979
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,140
You're not answering the question, man.

980
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,620
Wait, what did you say?

981
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,140
I wasn't listening.

982
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,060
Why do you know what suppositories are?

983
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,240
Oh, because I watch the shows with you.

984
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,160
Oh, true.

985
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:30,700
Oh, yeah.

986
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,380
You were there.

987
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,860
The story you choose to tell.

988
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,560
You see, this tale is only part written.

989
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,560
It's breaking the fourth wall.

990
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,260
He's talking to us.

991
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:48,340
And determine whether the lives of those with whom you are interfering continue to flourish or whether they are snuffed out.

992
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,420
Snuffed out.

993
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:51,520
Yeah.

994
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,540
You see, we each make decisions according to our own moral compass.

995
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,860
I think I have a great moral compass.

996
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,360
You literally couldn't press A.

997
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,880
It was a lot of pressure.

998
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,200
Okay.

999
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,040
It is the tax one pays for having lived and it comes eventually to everybody.

1000
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,460
Still, none of us want for it to come too soon.

1001
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,940
Yeah, Mint.

1002
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,080
Hey, hey, hey.

1003
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,840
I'm already dead.

1004
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,600
I fear nothing.

1005
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,140
Sometimes separately.

1006
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:28,640
What one does may not make complete sense to the other because we all have different perspectives.

1007
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,580
Yeah, anything you do makes no sense to me.

1008
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,960
And neither does you.

1009
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,960
That's why it's perfect.

1010
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,860
We're playing this.

1011
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:37,840
Yeah, it's perfect.

1012
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:42,220
I think the goal is to at least have one person survive.

1013
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:42,980
Probably.

1014
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,280
Who will it be?

1015
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:45,880
You or me?

1016
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,680
Here's one for free.

1017
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,620
There are pictures in this world that can show you some possible future.

1018
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,980
Oh, so it's like a hint.

1019
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:56,620
Yeah.

1020
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,900
They may just help you to make better decisions.

1021
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,280
Oh no.

1022
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,300
I think that's subjective.

1023
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,200
If they're better or not.

1024
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,140
Yeah, like how do we know if they're better decisions?

1025
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,780
That's all for the moment.

1026
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,620
We'll talk again soon enough.

1027
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,180
We'll have the opportunity to account for all the actions that you've taken.

1028
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:16,920
Thank you, sir.

1029
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,040
Thank you, man of Medan.

1030
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,600
Do we need to pay you now?

1031
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,660
I don't know this guy.

1032
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,320
Is this a trial period?

1033
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,080
Oh, that's where we were.

1034
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:28,920
That's the opening screen.

1035
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,160
It was just the water.

1036
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,780
Ooh.

1037
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,920
Donkey Bird is Alex.

1038
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,240
You're Brad?

1039
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,300
I'm Brad.

1040
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,420
You're Brad.

1041
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,580
I'm probably really cool.

1042
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,340
Which one is this?

1043
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,280
Brad's a cool name.

1044
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Is this the Brad or the Alex?

1045
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,980
Oh, I look like a nerd.

1046
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,180
I'm your brother.

1047
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,980
We're brothers.

1048
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,780
How do we always end up being brothers?

1049
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,160
Wait, which one?

1050
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:06,520
Is that you?

1051
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,120
Are you the nerd?

1052
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:07,760
Yes.

1053
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,500
Look at this nerd.

1054
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,160
You're insecure.

1055
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,160
Why does yours say innocent?

1056
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
What does that imply about me?

1057
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,600
I'm an innocent maiden.

1058
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:25,940
Down.

1059
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,100
Diving.

1060
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,220
Maybe you could show me how the pros do it.

1061
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:31,620
Ooh.

1062
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,000
Donkey Bird is deciding.

1063
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,320
Let's see.

1064
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,920
You didn't take lessons?

1065
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:38,640
Yeah.

1066
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,220
Kind of.

1067
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,500
Yeah.

1068
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,660
You think I can just save you like that?

1069
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,780
I'm gonna say nothing.

1070
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,700
That's right.

1071
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,660
Know your place, nerd.

1072
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,380
Hey.

1073
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,240
Hey.

1074
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,260
Oh, yeah.

1075
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,460
I'm an influencer.

1076
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,160
You're an influencer?

1077
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:07,980
Maybe.

1078
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,620
I don't know.

1079
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,320
I have a camera.

1080
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,960
So don't sweat the little stuff, man.

1081
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:11,540
It's not cool.

1082
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,920
Don't make me regret letting you tag along.

1083
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:14,640
Yeah.

1084
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,400
Don't make me regret it.

1085
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,100
Are you deciding again?

1086
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,280
Dude, you know I'm not like the best around new people.

1087
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,740
Oh, you're anxious.

1088
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,640
My anxiety went up.

1089
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,080
Yeah.

1090
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,720
Make me feel better.

1091
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:32,820
Bread.

1092
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,720
We're buddies.

1093
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,540
Oh, wait.

1094
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,440
I can see your traits.

1095
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,340
Oh, that's what you're looking at.

1096
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,420
What was it?

1097
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:39,620
RB?

1098
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,800
Oh, I can't see it.

1099
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,140
Yeah, RB.

1100
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,020
We have secrets, too.

1101
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,820
I can't see it since I'm in the pause.

1102
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,460
Oh, my God.

1103
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,820
I'm guarded.

1104
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,660
Genuine.

1105
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,520
I'm genuine.

1106
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:49,780
Insecure.

1107
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:50,680
Generous.

1108
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,680
Who the fuck is Conrad and Fliss?

1109
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,360
We're not there yet.

1110
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,620
We're not there yet.

1111
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,300
We have other people.

1112
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,080
Alex reminded Brad he's not just a tag along.

1113
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,500
Alex was annoyed that Brad had not taken diving lessons.

1114
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,360
Oh, my God.

1115
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:05,820
Come on.

1116
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,120
So I can't even see them.

1117
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,680
Now I'm gonna see it.

1118
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,320
Now you're gonna see it.

1119
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,040
It's RB.

1120
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,200
It's collections and characters.

1121
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,880
That's what it was.

1122
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,300
I'm witty.

1123
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:20,820
I'm eager.

1124
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,820
I'm innocent.

1125
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,620
Yeah, but are you genuine like me?

1126
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,160
You're not genuine.

1127
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,580
Mine literally says genuine.

1128
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,240
How do I see the other one?

1129
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,540
If you're not genuine, oh, you can't see it.

1130
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,400
We can only see ourselves.

1131
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,280
Mine says guarded, generous.

1132
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:39,500
Genuine.

1133
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,000
Yeah, I'm gen...

1134
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,700
I mean, I let you come over to the diving to the diving place.

1135
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,800
I could let you drown if I wanted to.

1136
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:50,880
You're my bro.

1137
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,920
You're not my brother.

1138
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,720
See, I'm being supportive.

1139
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,040
I mean, like, we're buddies, you know?

1140
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,960
Oh my god, we're buddies.

1141
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,760
Just out here to fucking hang, cool out, kick it.

1142
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:03,480
Yeah, you gotta loosen up, bro.

1143
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,720
Let's just kick it and be legends, man.

1144
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:06,580
You're Apex Legends?

1145
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,340
Alright, amigo.

1146
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,760
Sorry, I'm a little snappy.

1147
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:11,620
I'm just...

1148
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,120
Medical school would be stressful, you know?

1149
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,720
I'm a medical school doctor!

1150
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,480
Oh my god!

1151
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,000
At least I'm a cool nerd.

1152
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,620
You're a fucking influencer.

1153
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,820
It's been like two weeks.

1154
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:28,740
Come on, man.

1155
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,080
Right on cue.

1156
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,620
I'm smart and cool.

1157
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,340
What are you?

1158
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,320
I'm innocent.

1159
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,940
I'm innocent.

1160
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,060
I'm not gonna be a doctor.

1161
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:42,940
I'm gonna save lives.

1162
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,080
You need to save your own first.

1163
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,300
So, uh...

1164
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,360
Can I get your input on something?

1165
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:50,300
Oh my god, I'm gonna propose!

1166
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,760
Oh, you are?

1167
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,920
I have a big thing I'm trying to make a decision about.

1168
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,740
About finishing med school?

1169
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,280
No, but...

1170
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,120
It's just kind of a big life choice, you know?

1171
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't know what's the right thing to do.

1172
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,140
Do I marry her or not?

1173
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,260
I'm gonna say nothing.

1174
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,760
Why are you so supportive?

1175
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:20,540
Oh my god!

1176
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,500
That's my girlfriend!

1177
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:23,300
Your girlfriend, Julia!

1178
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,780
That's her brother!

1179
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:26,780
He's relaxed.

1180
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,120
He's foolhardy.

1181
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:28,740
What does that mean?

1182
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,740
Yo, you want me to hook you up with her brother?

1183
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,680
Oh, wow.

1184
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,440
You like that?

1185
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,200
This is Alex.

1186
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,720
Hey, what's up, man?

1187
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,140
Conrad.

1188
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,220
Watch it, sis.

1189
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:42,560
Lady killer.

1190
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,020
Right here.

1191
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:45,020
That's me.

1192
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,160
He's ignoring you.

1193
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,220
This Conrad guy looks like...

1194
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,100
Bradley!

1195
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,380
She looks like that actor.

1196
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,220
Dr. Horrible.

1197
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,660
Neil Patrick Harris.

1198
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,740
Neil Patrick Harris.

1199
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,300
Hey, man.

1200
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,680
Wanna crack a cold one?

1201
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,060
Of course.

1202
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,740
I'm cracking a cold one!

1203
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,760
Every second.

1204
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,440
Every second.

1205
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,180
I love you.

1206
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,780
I'm gonna be cool.

1207
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,680
I'm gonna be cool, you guys.

1208
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:10,720
Cool.

1209
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,520
We're cracking a cold one.

1210
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:12,980
No!

1211
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,380
She called me needy!

1212
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,300
I love you.

1213
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:18,900
I'm not needy!

1214
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:19,380
I swear!

1215
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:20,160
I'm not needy!

1216
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I swear!

1217
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,800
I think this is my first time having a beer.

1218
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,580
I think this is my first time having a beer.

1219
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,340
Are you cracking a beer?

1220
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,840
Yeah, I'm cracking a cold one.

1221
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:28,340
It's the jib.

1222
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,100
Oh, wait.

1223
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,120
I thought I was throwing up.

1224
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,860
Throw up, I did.

1225
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:34,660
I can't believe it.

1226
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,140
Wait, who's that?

1227
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,640
Who's this?

1228
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,160
This is my love interest now.

1229
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,660
Where's the old crust bucket skipper?

1230
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,100
It's burning out.

1231
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,080
Captain of the Duke of Milan.

1232
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:48,000
Oh, dang.

1233
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,520
She looks like a badass.

1234
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:51,700
Oh my gosh, did you see her tattoo?

1235
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,320
Yeah.

1236
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,840
I'd invite you to make yourselves at home, but...

1237
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,780
Why is everybody...

1238
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,700
Why is it so awkward?

1239
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,700
Yeah, isn't she the captain?

1240
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,180
Yeah, you don't know who's sailing the ship?

1241
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,120
Like, what's going on?

1242
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,100
Here we go.

1243
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:10,860
You're selling.

1244
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,480
I'm buying.

1245
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,440
I hope Conrad dies first.

1246
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,660
Yeah, me too.

1247
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,720
Conrad, that's fucked up.

1248
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,460
Do not flirt with the person who knows how to drive the boat.

1249
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,000
Yeah.

1250
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,100
What are we doing here anyway?

1251
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:27,880
We're diving?

1252
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:28,520
Is that it?

1253
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,380
Yeah, we're learning how to dive.

1254
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:30,980
Cool.

1255
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,020
The Duke of Milan.

1256
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,480
Oh, that's you.

1257
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,040
No, that's you.

1258
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,480
You're the blue shit.

1259
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,980
Oh, you're right.

1260
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,800
We're the fucking blue shit.

1261
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,300
Look, she's like comforting me.

1262
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,660
She likes it when they're weak.

1263
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:56,180
What?

1264
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,680
Oh.

1265
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,720
What is this?

1266
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,440
She's going through the picks.

1267
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,660
Can you see me going through the picks?

1268
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,920
No, I'm fucking talking to the captain right now.

1269
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,400
I'm looking at something.

1270
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:09,540
Oh!

1271
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,320
I found a ship.

1272
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:11,460
I found a ship.

1273
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,780
Well, hot diggity dong.

1274
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,380
Dong?

1275
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,540
Alex, come here.

1276
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,160
I think we got something.

1277
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,560
I think it's hot diggity dong.

1278
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,380
Wait, you did your homework?

1279
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:28,760
What do you mean?

1280
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:30,120
Oh.

1281
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,460
Yeah, we got a wreck.

1282
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,100
We got a wreck.

1283
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:34,080
We have to do some diving.

1284
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,560
You suggested.

1285
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,080
The captain said it's not a good idea, but I trusted you, Mint.

1286
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:39,740
Okay, cool.

1287
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:39,980
Thanks.

1288
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:40,840
I trusted your call.

1289
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:43,200
Check it out.

1290
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,520
If we die, it's on you.

1291
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,180
Hot diggity dong.

1292
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,260
I'm looking at the pictures now.

1293
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,920
Brad's calculations were right on the money.

1294
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,020
Always bet on Brad.

1295
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:55,300
See?

1296
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,160
I'm smart.

1297
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:56,860
Brad is smart.

1298
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,200
We found a plane.

1299
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,340
I don't know.

1300
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,440
The captain was like, not a good idea.

1301
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,100
Technically, we should call this in to port authorities.

1302
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,940
As an unreported wreck.

1303
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:09,620
Technically.

1304
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,060
Are you sure you don't want to do this the right way?

1305
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:13,600
Wow.

1306
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:15,860
Doki Bird is deciding.

1307
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,780
Don't let Doki Bird to sell it.

1308
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,640
Look at the look on his face.

1309
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:22,940
I'm gonna be disappointed.

1310
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:23,400
Wait.

1311
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,480
Are you saying we shouldn't dive?

1312
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,420
Oh.

1313
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,380
Why am I Conrad?

1314
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,180
Wait, you're Conrad now?

1315
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:31,260
Guys, look.

1316
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:38,360
I think we gotta listen to our experienced, beautiful, smart, and beautiful captain here.

1317
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,240
If she says we should do things the right way.

1318
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:40,340
Connie, please.

1319
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,980
I didn't bring you on this trip to get laid.

1320
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:42,480
Wait, what?

1321
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,520
No, no, no.

1322
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:45,980
It's not.

1323
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,580
I'm just saying she's right.

1324
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,640
Not because she's beautiful.

1325
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,660
I mean, she is beautiful.

1326
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:53,400
But that's like a coincidence.

1327
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,260
Oh my god.

1328
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,640
I'm Conrad now.

1329
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:57,820
I have to do what I have to do.

1330
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,540
Generously, we're diving.

1331
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:00,880
You're the client.

1332
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:03,300
Oh my god.

1333
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,920
I think I'm gonna marry a bitch.

1334
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,800
I just can't wait.

1335
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,540
She's like a Karen for real.

1336
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:10,780
Yeah, I think I'm gonna marry a Karen.

1337
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,360
Why did you not say anything?

1338
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,140
Why did you say nothing when I asked you?

1339
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:19,640
I'll set up the tanks.

1340
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,960
The boys will do the final check.

1341
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,780
It's not my call.

1342
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:22,940
Take a look at the camera.

1343
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,260
See if you can find anything useful.

1344
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,420
Yeah, what the hell is that?

1345
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,080
Maybe you should check on your bro.

1346
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,600
Yeah, where's the bro?

1347
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:31,820
Where's Brad?

1348
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,600
Brad, where are you?

1349
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:37,740
Where are you, Brad?

1350
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,060
I wanna look at the binoculars.

1351
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,900
The way you like walk and glide around.

1352
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,060
The way you like walk and glide around.

1353
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,760
I'll find you later.

1354
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,040
I'm looking at the binoculars.

1355
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,800
I'm looking at the pictures again.

1356
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,060
I like the pictures.

1357
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,200
I'm an iPad kid.

1358
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:59,100
Oh, that opening.

1359
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,140
Okay, we got it.

1360
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,180
Can I put it back?

1361
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,560
This is like such a tiny ship.

1362
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:05,760
Where could Brad go?

1363
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,320
I think he's laying down.

1364
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:07,900
Oh, I'm stuck.

1365
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,880
Wait, where am I?

1366
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,460
Hey, I'm gonna talk to my girlfriend.

1367
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,360
Me too.

1368
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,080
Almost got the gear.

1369
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:14,700
Good to go.

1370
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,920
You're vibrating.

1371
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,780
I'm in this conversation too.

1372
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,200
Let me in.

1373
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:26,600
I think we're in good shape.

1374
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:28,040
It's probably not a bad idea.

1375
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,520
I'm actually in the conversation.

1376
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,580
Hey, JJ.

1377
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:31,880
You alright?

1378
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:32,680
JJ?

1379
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:33,400
Punky Dory.

1380
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:36,440
Gotta say, not too happy with our captain at the moment.

1381
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,580
She's right there!

1382
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,680
Wait, what?

1383
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,160
Who are you deciding?

1384
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,300
I'm gonna be annoyed.

1385
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,260
Are you gonna be white knight hair?

1386
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:49,300
We paid top dollar to come out here in the middle of nowhere to do whatever the hell we want without any Namby Pambys breathing down our neck.

1387
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,420
That's the good old American way.

1388
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,320
I'm serious, Connie.

1389
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,920
Alright, I'm gonna get these rebreathers set up and then we'll go through the final steps together.

1390
00:51:57,300 --> 00:51:57,580
Great.

1391
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,300
I'm gonna kick back and enjoy the sights for a little while.

1392
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,200
I can't believe the captain didn't even hear that.

1393
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,360
I know, me too.

1394
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,140
He admits to being a creep!

1395
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:08,400
Oh my god!

1396
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,920
He's self-aware!

1397
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,040
Why are you vibrating in this place?

1398
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:15,340
Hey, hold on!

1399
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:16,740
I'm trying to go to Brad's!

1400
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,860
I wanna talk to him!

1401
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,820
I wanna look at the weather!

1402
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:20,560
I'm going to Brad.

1403
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,080
I'm going to Brad.

1404
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:21,940
Alright.

1405
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,280
What's this?

1406
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,420
Oh, I turned it off.

1407
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,460
Wait, I think I see a picture.

1408
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:25,120
Wait, hold on.

1409
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:28,300
Is this one of those sneaky pictures?

1410
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:29,840
Well, hello.

1411
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,460
I found one.

1412
00:52:32,540 --> 00:52:32,720
What's this?

1413
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:34,220
What are you looking at?

1414
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,340
That told me nothing.

1415
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:36,780
I'm heading over.

1416
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,880
I unlocked a premonition.

1417
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,920
Oh, that's gonna help us with decisions, remember?

1418
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:42,460
Yeah.

1419
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,440
I wanna see so I know that you won't fuck up.

1420
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,920
He's gonna be in here.

1421
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,380
Where's his premonition?

1422
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:52,900
Wait, that's Brad.

1423
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:53,600
Yeah.

1424
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,200
Shouldn't have had that beer.

1425
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:55,940
It doesn't do anything.

1426
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,240
What does that mean?

1427
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,620
I'm gonna be out.

1428
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:00,280
What does that mean?

1429
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,640
I'm trying to make a decision!

1430
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,920
I'm trying to look at a premonition right now.

1431
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,700
I'm making a decision!

1432
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:11,480
Okay.

1433
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,540
Brad's like in the bathroom.

1434
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,380
I'm gonna be a dick to him.

1435
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,620
You're gonna be a dick to my bro?

1436
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,100
You're gonna be a dick to yourself?

1437
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,740
I hate myself.

1438
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:23,620
I hate myself.

1439
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,800
You got that whole brainiac thing going on.

1440
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,040
That's nothing to sneeze at.

1441
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,880
Don't worry, stud.

1442
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,180
She's all yours.

1443
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:29,620
Oh!

1444
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,220
Why did he do that?

1445
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,400
Okay, that's my cue to beat it.

1446
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:35,920
What is this?

1447
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,560
What is cologne?

1448
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,120
Captain Kiss?

1449
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,220
I'm looking at cologne while you're bullying yourself.

1450
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:43,680
Where are you?

1451
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,520
Are you in the bathroom?

1452
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:47,420
I was opening the closet.

1453
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:48,800
I can't open it.

1454
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:49,740
There's another room here.

1455
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:50,960
Oh, I'm going in?

1456
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,340
Yeah, now I'll talk to my little bro.

1457
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,180
What's up?

1458
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:54,520
What's up?

1459
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:55,860
What are you doing?

1460
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,000
Hello, locker.

1461
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,440
Hello, locker.

1462
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,380
Oh, I'm going through people's things.

1463
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,660
That's really normal.

1464
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,500
What's this now?

1465
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,940
Oh, I'm looking at the cologne, too.

1466
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,840
Fancy.

1467
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,840
Good on ya, Alex.

1468
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,700
Why am I going through your stuff?

1469
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,180
What the hell?

1470
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,900
Look, I comfort my bro after you bullied him.

1471
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,840
Hey, hey, hey!

1472
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,100
I was just snooping a little.

1473
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:24,500
What are you doing?

1474
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,180
I was, uh, up to code.

1475
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,740
I'm just being normal.

1476
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm just being normal.

1477
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,800
I saw you looking at my cologne.

1478
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:34,400
I took your cologne, actually.

1479
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,160
Wait, you took my cologne?

1480
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,940
That door doesn't open.

1481
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,900
And then we talked to our bro.

1482
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,420
Alright, I'm gonna go talk to the captain now.

1483
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,220
Captain Kiss.

1484
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,260
I'm gonna watch you talk to the captain.

1485
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:48,360
Watch me riz her up.

1486
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,400
Hey, girl.

1487
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,500
Oh, captain, my captain.

1488
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:55,980
Get out of my cutscene.

1489
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:57,280
You know, we have rules out here for a reason.

1490
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,260
You guys gotta respect that.

1491
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,260
At least you showed me a little respect.

1492
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,140
Even if you're the only one in the group.

1493
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:07,020
Really?

1494
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,960
Oh, captain, my captain?

1495
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,080
I like it when you're strict.

1496
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,280
Hey, I like it when you're strict.

1497
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,860
Sometimes I just want to be kept in line, you know what I'm saying?

1498
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,860
I don't mind a little submission that way.

1499
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:16,920
Oh my god!

1500
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,020
Turn that off.

1501
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:18,800
Turn what off?

1502
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,920
That thing where you have to hit on me, like, every two seconds.

1503
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,900
I think she likes it.

1504
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,480
Oh my god.

1505
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,080
Bro.

1506
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,180
So, is it working?

1507
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:28,900
Where are you?

1508
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,080
Come back to my cutscene.

1509
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:30,820
Do you have brain damage?

1510
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,400
Oh, there you are!

1511
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,580
These rules are all pretty basic stuff.

1512
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,940
How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?

1513
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,600
How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?

1514
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:42,740
How much experience do you have with these kind of dives?

1515
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,560
Are you still talking to me?

1516
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:44,840
Yeah!

1517
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,100
Pretty much an authority back home.

1518
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,220
If you move around, does he move?

1519
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:52,340
Then why don't you want to follow the rules for unreported wrecks?

1520
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,400
For all you know, this could be a war group.

1521
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:59,260
This derby hit would be illegal anymore.

1522
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:05,180
I'm gonna be playful.

1523
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,300
You know, you're even more toxic than me right now.

1524
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,000
And I'm gonna get wasted.

1525
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:12,900
You've literally never spoken to a woman before in your life, have you?

1526
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,320
You've only talked to your sister.

1527
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,180
Damn!

1528
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,980
It's my turn to talk to her now.

1529
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,480
Alright, you talk to her, you talk to her.

1530
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,000
I'm watching, I'm watching.

1531
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,240
Are you talking to her?

1532
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,500
No, I'm stuck.

1533
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,760
Wait, the conversation!

1534
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:32,180
Wait, I'm stuck!

1535
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,680
I'm stuck!

1536
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:39,040
I can't progress!

1537
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:39,820
I can't progress!

1538
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,760
I can't progress!

1539
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:41,340
No!

1540
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,580
What's going on?

1541
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:48,980
What's going on?

1542
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,060
No!

1543
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,880
We broke the game!

1544
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:58,020
You broke the game!

1545
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:58,940
Fix it!

1546
00:56:59,160 --> 00:56:59,560
Fix it!

1547
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:00,220
Talk to our sister!

1548
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:01,540
Oh, wait, wait, wait, there you go, there you go, there you go.

1549
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,680
Alright, try again, try again.

1550
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,060
No, I can't move!

1551
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,060
No, I can't move!

1552
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:04,560
You can't move!

1553
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,100
Wait, wait, there's something over here.

1554
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,080
Hold on, I'm gonna go look at it.

1555
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:09,420
Yeah, yeah, start the next scene, Min!

1556
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:10,640
Start the next scene!

1557
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:11,120
Oh!

1558
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:12,460
She said something.

1559
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:14,780
Oh, what's going on?

1560
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,840
Oh my god, I'm looking at her driver's license!

1561
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,280
I'm such a freak!

1562
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,240
It looks like it might be bogus.

1563
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,400
How do we start the next scene?

1564
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,520
Um, hold on...

1565
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,220
I just doubted her credentials.

1566
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,240
Wait, she's your sister, what do you mean you doubted her credentials?

1567
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,500
No, no, no!

1568
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,800
Oh my god, you're still standing there!

1569
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,640
How do we start the game?

1570
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:42,920
I can't!

1571
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,580
Hold on, I'm gonna push you, I'm gonna push you, I'm gonna push you.

1572
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:46,480
Put me into the boat!

1573
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:47,900
Put me into the boat!

1574
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,680
I can't push you, I can't push you!

1575
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,560
Hold on, I'm gonna go talk to my sister!

1576
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,620
Oh my god!

1577
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:55,540
Oh my god!

1578
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,620
Yo, Alex!

1579
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,040
Don't get out here!

1580
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,080
Oh my god, it's fixed!

1581
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:01,660
Oh my god, it's fixed!

1582
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:01,680
...

1583
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:01,920
...

1584
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,100
...

1585
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:03,160
...

1586
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:04,520
...

1587
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:04,540
...

1588
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:09,600
It's all that CO2 that you'd normally just exhale into the water, and instead, it gets totally reused.

1589
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,480
Then it repeats.

1590
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,480
Oh yeah, we have to do it.

1591
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,720
We won't die, we won't die here.

1592
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:17,720
O2 check done.

1593
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:19,880
Okay.

1594
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,160
I don't think I'm diving.

1595
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,940
I'm not suited up for...

1596
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:24,240
Are you gonna be my girlfriend now?

1597
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,320
You gotta check your O2 first.

1598
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,560
Oh, maybe.

1599
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:28,360
Oh, okay.

1600
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,300
Thanks for being playful.

1601
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:31,640
I'm gonna be playful.

1602
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,860
I'd like to take you underwater.

1603
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,860
That's my sis you're talking about.

1604
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:37,800
What the fuck?

1605
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,680
You were like creeping on the captain earlier.

1606
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,740
Jesus, why is he so loud?

1607
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:43,900
This is the line, this is the line.

1608
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,680
When I was looking at the dive cam, I saw this huge hole in the tail.

1609
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,380
Kabooey.

1610
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:48,520
Kabooey?

1611
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,140
That's your way into the plane.

1612
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,680
Nice work, man.

1613
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,800
Thanks, Conrad.

1614
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,080
Okay, you little clownfishes.

1615
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,000
I'm gonna go see what Fliss is up to.

1616
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,400
Oh my god, leave her alone!

1617
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:03,380
Right after defending you, sissy, you're like, Anyway, I'm gonna hit Rob up the captain again.

1618
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,840
I'm gonna beat you.

1619
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:06,680
Are those two going in or what?

1620
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,760
Wait, what's the baton stick or the camera?

1621
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,120
We don't need a camera.

1622
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,920
We're gonna need that baton.

1623
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,020
Alright, kids!

1624
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:13,400
Good to go!

1625
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,640
I don't know what this is.

1626
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,500
Just remember the rules, please!

1627
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:17,200
A bang stick?

1628
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,360
Haha.

1629
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,220
Haha.

1630
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,040
You ever have to use one?

1631
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,060
On a shark?

1632
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:21,640
Nope.

1633
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,900
Okay, are you going in?

1634
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:25,960
Oh, you're deciding.

1635
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,140
Take the camera or Julia?

1636
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:31,220
Why is the lighting really dark all of a sudden?

1637
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,060
Oh!

1638
00:59:32,060 --> 00:59:32,620
I can't!

1639
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:33,380
What's happening?

1640
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:34,180
Alright.

1641
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,020
Please better not be pissy this whole trip.

1642
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:36,400
Why is the lighting so dark all of a sudden?

1643
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,880
And she should remember who's signing the checks.

1644
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,100
Very large checks.

1645
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:41,840
How to buy us out of this little wiggle room with the rules.

1646
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,220
Oh, it's fixed.

1647
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:46,940
It's fixed.

1648
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,740
Oh my god.

1649
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,440
What's happening?

1650
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:54,460
Oh, you guys are going in.

1651
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:54,560
I don't know.

1652
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,320
Why is she just looking at us like that?

1653
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,400
I think she's nervous.

1654
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:00,200
Whoa, these are high tech.

1655
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:00,360
I got a bang stick.

1656
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:01,620
You got a...

1657
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,300
I got a stick that... that bangs.

1658
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:04,300
Uh-huh.

1659
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,060
That's why.

1660
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,200
Is that why you took it?

1661
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,840
Julia liked it last night.

1662
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,000
Whoa.

1663
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,960
Wait, so am I doing nothing?

1664
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:18,740
Nice.

1665
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,160
Alright, it's up to you, Dokie.

1666
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,600
Wait a minute.

1667
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,540
You were Brad, now Conrad, and now Julia?

1668
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:27,620
Like, pick a lane.

1669
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,300
There's no way.

1670
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,200
There's no way.

1671
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,020
Oh my god, there's dead bodies in here.

1672
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,140
Wait, there's dead bodies in here.

1673
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:34,400
Is this Madon?

1674
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,360
No, this is a plane.

1675
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:39,920
It's a plane?

1676
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:40,500
Yeah.

1677
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,720
Why are we going in here?

1678
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,320
Oh my god.

1679
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,320
Because we found this wreck.

1680
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:47,820
Here we go.

1681
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:49,840
Down we go.

1682
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:52,160
Why are we diving when it's the sun setting?

1683
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,180
Should we just wait for day?

1684
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:53,720
Whoa.

1685
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:54,800
You good?

1686
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,200
Are you still talking to her?

1687
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,180
No, I'm watching the cutscene.

1688
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,000
Oh shit, the sharks.

1689
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,140
Uh oh.

1690
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,560
You're gonna need to use your bag stick.

1691
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,680
The boat looks really far away.

1692
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,460
I'm gonna be flipped.

1693
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:14,140
Okay.

1694
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:16,260
Alright, you know what?

1695
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:17,220
Sure.

1696
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,520
I'll give you one.

1697
01:01:18,820 --> 01:01:19,920
Wait, are you on the boat?

1698
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:21,240
Yeah, I'm flipped.

1699
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,240
I'm underwater!

1700
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,500
No way!

1701
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,280
No way!

1702
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,800
We know why somebody died.

1703
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,200
Let's swim around a little and find a way in.

1704
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:39,120
Oh my god.

1705
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,920
One of the pictures showed an opening.

1706
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,080
Doki Bird is flipped.

1707
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,060
Why am I?

1708
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:44,020
Why am I Julia?

1709
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,440
All of a sudden.

1710
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,600
You're the Karen.

1711
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:49,780
Oh my god.

1712
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:53,060
Here I go.

1713
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,500
I'm going inside the ship.

1714
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,420
Oh my god.

1715
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,360
Comrade wants to invest in my business.

1716
01:01:59,360 --> 01:01:59,920
What?

1717
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,460
Okay.

1718
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,640
Oh, I want Conrad's money.

1719
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:06,300
Oh, I almost just killed Julia, I think.

1720
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:06,640
Be careful.

1721
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,480
It could be dangerous.

1722
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,000
Oh my god, that scared me.

1723
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,820
Oh my god, I just noticed something was wrong.

1724
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,360
Wait, what do you mean?

1725
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:18,180
Explore the plane.

1726
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,620
Can I just take a second to say, holy shit, Alex, we did it.

1727
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,880
Let's see.

1728
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,820
Wait for the others to return from the dive.

1729
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,640
Oh, you are doing...

1730
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:29,280
Why are you doing the action part?

1731
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,220
I don't know.

1732
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,340
Why am I doing the action part?

1733
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:34,900
I'm just chilling.

1734
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,740
I'm just chilling on the ship right now.

1735
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:38,500
Wait, what was that?

1736
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:38,820
What was that?

1737
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,080
What was that?

1738
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,340
Hold on.

1739
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:40,280
Oh, I can talk to you.

1740
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:40,920
You can?

1741
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:41,980
Yeah.

1742
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:43,180
Hello.

1743
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,380
I didn't hear...

1744
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:47,680
Do you guys hear me?

1745
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,220
Oh, I heard it.

1746
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:48,720
I heard it.

1747
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,320
We're looking at a hole.

1748
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:51,900
Ignore her.

1749
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:52,580
Ignore Fliss.

1750
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,900
Julia, leave it.

1751
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,740
You're saying ignore me?

1752
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:57,120
Not worth it.

1753
01:02:57,660 --> 01:02:58,880
That pipe's pretty tight.

1754
01:02:58,880 --> 01:02:59,580
She's angry.

1755
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:00,700
I'm gonna call you guys again.

1756
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,700
I'm not even...

1757
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,940
You think you can just ignore me like that?

1758
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:07,480
Ring, ring, ring.

1759
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:09,620
Don't be such a gonad, Alex.

1760
01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:10,240
I'll be fine.

1761
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:10,600
Julia?

1762
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:12,240
Gonad?

1763
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:12,640
Seriously?

1764
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,500
Oh, you're gonna ghost me now?

1765
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,160
Yeah, I'm doing risky business, okay?

1766
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:21,520
Don't be such a gonad, Doki God.

1767
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,140
You think I'm not gonna spam call you now?

1768
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,240
Oh, my God.

1769
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:30,520
I think she might die.

1770
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,000
Uh-oh.

1771
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:32,480
Don't worry.

1772
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:32,880
Don't worry.

1773
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,740
I'm calling you guys again.

1774
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:34,160
Don't...

1775
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,060
Uh-oh.

1776
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,120
Oh, there's an octopus in here!

1777
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:44,500
Don't be such a gonad.

1778
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,820
Okay, if you guys die, stop.

1779
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:50,140
You guys die.

1780
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,500
I got it.

1781
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,060
I got it.

1782
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:53,180
Uh-oh.

1783
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:53,340
Let's see.

1784
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:53,720
What's this?

1785
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:54,960
Uh-oh.

1786
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:55,700
Those are the photos.

1787
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:56,560
Uh-oh.

1788
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,140
I'm lost.

1789
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,240
Oh, he's here.

1790
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,300
You're a good boyfriend.

1791
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:02,780
He gave me oxygen.

1792
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,320
Oh, nice.

1793
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,620
Now you're gonna kill fucking Alex.

1794
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,840
You're gonna kill Alex.

1795
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,380
I spent so much...

1796
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:15,880
I spent a lot of difficult decisions to get Alex to where he's at.

1797
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,360
And now you're just gonna kill him off.

1798
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:18,340
I know what I'm doing.

1799
01:04:18,740 --> 01:04:19,800
I know what I'm doing, okay?

1800
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,280
I don't need a lifeguard.

1801
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:22,580
She is so rude.

1802
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,620
I told you.

1803
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:25,680
She's such a Karen.

1804
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,120
I hope she dies.

1805
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,740
This... this... oh.

1806
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:30,560
You found a secret.

1807
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,160
Yeah.

1808
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:33,440
Yeah, because I did risky business.

1809
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,060
I told you.

1810
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,040
Oh, I'm lagging.

1811
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:35,500
Oh, my God.

1812
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:36,020
What's happening?

1813
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:36,740
Okay.

1814
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,220
Search...

1815
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,940
Go easy on the booze.

1816
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,180
I'm gonna... I'm bullying Brad right now.

1817
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:44,720
See?

1818
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,080
It's easy to bully him.

1819
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,580
Well, let's avoid that tube.

1820
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:52,800
Here we go.

1821
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:53,980
What do you know, Brad?

1822
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,060
What do you know, Brad?

1823
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:55,860
He doesn't know anything.

1824
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:56,320
He's Brad.

1825
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:00,160
It's a loser.

1826
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:02,820
Okay.

1827
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:03,520
All right.

1828
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,560
Oh, the ship is around World War II.

1829
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:07,260
Yeah.

1830
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:07,660
Right?

1831
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:08,400
Because...

1832
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,580
You hear that?

1833
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:12,440
What is that?

1834
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:13,100
Let's check it out.

1835
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:14,860
Oh, God.

1836
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:15,420
Uh-oh.

1837
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,000
What is that?

1838
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:16,900
I'm using my bang stick.

1839
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:17,860
I'm using my bang stick.

1840
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,300
What am I banging?

1841
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:21,500
You're welcome.

1842
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,220
I got you that bang stick.

1843
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:23,980
I did it.

1844
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,860
I used it.

1845
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,280
I used it.

1846
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:27,740
Did you like it?

1847
01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:29,500
Oh, my God.

1848
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,060
It's a dead man.

1849
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:35,460
She's banging.

1850
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,120
She's banging.

1851
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:36,660
I'm banging.

1852
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,220
I'm banging.

1853
01:05:37,660 --> 01:05:40,280
I'm investigating the ghost.

1854
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:43,860
What happened?

1855
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,480
An eel attacked me.

1856
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,980
All I get is the ship with fucking Conrad.

1857
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,900
You get to explore.

1858
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,940
I have to deal with fucking Conrad.

1859
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:56,360
Got it.

1860
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:00,640
Plane crashed not high on my list of ways to perish.

1861
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,220
I'm just saying.

1862
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:05,040
Maybe you should have picked Brad instead.

1863
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:07,800
Oh, there's another guy.

1864
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:08,800
Wait.

1865
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:09,120
Hold on.

1866
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,480
Let me investigate him, please.

1867
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:11,620
Investigate.

1868
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:12,820
I'm trying to turn around.

1869
01:06:12,980 --> 01:06:14,220
So, are you beached?

1870
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:15,440
Easy now.

1871
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,500
This stuff's been down here a long time.

1872
01:06:17,860 --> 01:06:19,120
I'm piloting the plane.

1873
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,820
Oh, my God.

1874
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,260
I'm piloting.

1875
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:24,800
Oh, my God.

1876
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:25,780
Should I hit him?

1877
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,980
Should I hit on Conrad?

1878
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:27,740
Yeah.

1879
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:29,160
Do I do it?

1880
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:29,880
I'm gonna hit on Conrad.

1881
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:30,380
Do it.

1882
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:30,640
Do it.

1883
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:30,920
Do it.

1884
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:32,620
Don't touch anything else, please.

1885
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,280
Oh, my God.

1886
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,140
Conrad said he'll invest in my business.

1887
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:38,720
Oh, my God.

1888
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,160
You're in.

1889
01:06:40,180 --> 01:06:40,520
You're in.

1890
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:41,540
I'm in.

1891
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,540
Good God.

1892
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:42,940
Oh, my God.

1893
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:44,600
My business is gonna flourish now.

1894
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:49,700
I like how the girl was just like, it's not like we're gonna ruin the ship or anything.

1895
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:51,720
And here I go ruining the ship.

1896
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:52,540
Yeah.

1897
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,920
I like how I'm also being your wingman right now.

1898
01:06:57,900 --> 01:06:59,320
Oh, he's holding something.

1899
01:06:59,860 --> 01:07:01,160
His wife and kids.

1900
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:01,900
Oh, my God.

1901
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:03,580
He's in.

1902
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,260
How to turn this on?

1903
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,880
Am I just waiting on you guys to return to the ship?

1904
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:13,580
I think so.

1905
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:14,360
I think so.

1906
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:17,020
I'm just literally waiting.

1907
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:18,620
Guys, hurry up.

1908
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:24,100
Didn't what's his name say that like wrecking, wreck, like diving was his thing?

1909
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:25,900
Oh, there he is.

1910
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:26,420
There's pirates.

1911
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:27,200
What?

1912
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:28,420
Uh-oh.

1913
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:29,500
What do you mean there's pirates?

1914
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:31,140
Like, yo ho.

1915
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,980
That's not the Coast Guard.

1916
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:33,980
Uh-oh.

1917
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:34,340
Wait.

1918
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:34,880
What do you mean?

1919
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:36,860
Oh, I'm stuck.

1920
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:37,540
I think.

1921
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:38,480
I'm stuck.

1922
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:38,960
I'm stuck.

1923
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:39,300
Hold on.

1924
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:39,580
I think.

1925
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,020
Do I need to come back?

1926
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:41,900
You should call me back.

1927
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:42,560
I think there's pirates.

1928
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,320
You should call and say like, hey.

1929
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,100
Get up here.

1930
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:49,940
Oh, no.

1931
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,220
Oh, what's going on?

1932
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:52,700
There's pirates.

1933
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:54,420
Fucked up.

1934
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:55,880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1935
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,380
They're moving the ship.

1936
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:58,720
They're moving the plane.

1937
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,180
Oh, my God.

1938
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,140
They're destroying it.

1939
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:04,000
Wait.

1940
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:04,360
What?

1941
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:07,220
They're destroying the plane.

1942
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:10,140
Grab that.

1943
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:10,620
Oh, my God.

1944
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:11,200
There's a shark.

1945
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,060
Who's that?

1946
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,280
I don't know.

1947
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:14,660
Shark?

1948
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,380
Now there's a shark?

1949
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,100
Something cold.

1950
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:17,800
Come at me, shark.

1951
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:18,980
Come at me, shark.

1952
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,400
It's a great weak shark.

1953
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,020
Not interested in us.

1954
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:22,700
Let's go.

1955
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:23,820
Wow.

1956
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,240
Your guy is a doctor.

1957
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:25,380
Oh, my God.

1958
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:25,860
And he's a doctor.

1959
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,920
And also a marine biologist.

1960
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:28,180
How does he know everything?

1961
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,100
Okay, Mint?

1962
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:30,820
We're coming back.

1963
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:32,340
Mint...

1964
01:08:32,340 --> 01:08:33,540
We're coming back.

1965
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:34,860
Comrade's a bitch.

1966
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:35,140
Okay.

1967
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,640
He's antagonizing the pirates.

1968
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:41,640
What?

1969
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:42,840
What?

1970
01:08:43,980 --> 01:08:44,980
Why are you fidgeting?

1971
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:45,820
Oh, my God.

1972
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,480
I think Alex is trying to propose under here.

1973
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:50,900
I wanted to bring something up with you, but...

1974
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:51,500
In the water.

1975
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,060
I think he's trying to propose.

1976
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,120
You're a pirate.

1977
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:55,260
Oh, my God.

1978
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:55,360
What?

1979
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:55,860
What's going on?

1980
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:57,380
Oh my god.

1981
01:08:58,220 --> 01:08:59,400
I don't know what to say.

1982
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,780
I'm just gonna say nothing.

1983
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:02,980
What's going on?

1984
01:09:04,900 --> 01:09:06,540
Oh, he gave up.

1985
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:06,920
Okay.

1986
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:09,280
Seriously?

1987
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,500
What's going on?

1988
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,620
What's going on, Alex?

1989
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,020
What is going on down there?

1990
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,220
There's so many things going on!

1991
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:22,100
My relationship with Alex is going down.

1992
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:25,920
My relationship with Conrad is also going down.

1993
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:32,260
It's nice to know we're both sabotaging each other's relationships.

1994
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,340
I know.

1995
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,140
It's fine.

1996
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:37,160
I can make it up.

1997
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:38,300
I make it up in tenfold.

1998
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:41,520
Whatever you say to her doesn't mean anything.

1999
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,440
Oh my god.

2000
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,260
Conrad's fucking... Oh!

2001
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,720
Conrad's barbecuing.

2002
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,760
And he's fucked up.

2003
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,460
I'm more like you.

2004
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:55,620
What do you mean?

2005
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:56,880
I'm controlling the captain!

2006
01:09:58,020 --> 01:09:59,400
I don't even get to make a choice.

2007
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,140
I'm going.

2008
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:01,700
I'm going.

2009
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,240
I'm going.

2010
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:03,140
Fuck it.

2011
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:03,480
I'm going.

2012
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,680
He's like, we gotta decompress.

2013
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:08,760
She's heroic.

2014
01:10:10,820 --> 01:10:13,620
Oh, and Alex is just like chilling in the water.

2015
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:16,640
Wait.

2016
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,300
I'm like stuck on... Okay.

2017
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,040
Alright, Conrad, it's going down.

2018
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,120
Guys, I'm messing up Conrad after all the hard work I did flirting.

2019
01:10:27,540 --> 01:10:29,360
Hey, JJ, don't worry about it.

2020
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,460
What's going on?

2021
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,340
Why did they go at sunset?

2022
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:37,300
You set money in the...

2023
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,120
Yeah, what's that money for?

2024
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:43,660
There was a little mishap with the barbecue.

2025
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,460
I'm all true stick now.

2026
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,640
Jesus, looks like the whole boat was lit up.

2027
01:10:47,320 --> 01:10:48,340
Yeah, for real.

2028
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,380
It was Conrad's fault.

2029
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:53,420
So, why are you paying the ocean?

2030
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,260
Yeah, why are you paying the ocean?

2031
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,680
A fishing boat came by and got damaged on the dive line.

2032
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,960
Oh, that's what happened.

2033
01:11:03,240 --> 01:11:07,320
Yeah, they were being a little surly about it, so Conrad made it rain and they pissed off.

2034
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:07,880
Wow.

2035
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:08,640
Whatever.

2036
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:09,700
They didn't even take the money.

2037
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:12,440
What I want to know is, what did you guys find?

2038
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,240
Yeah, what did you find?

2039
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,160
We found the plane.

2040
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,400
And it is huge.

2041
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:16,980
That's cool stuff.

2042
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,920
Yeah, like eels and sharks apparently.

2043
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:20,580
We did not leave it as pristine as we could.

2044
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:21,160
What?

2045
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:22,780
Why?

2046
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:24,140
The dive line actually.

2047
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,320
Yeah, the dive line.

2048
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,440
How bad?

2049
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,040
Uh, there's no cockpit anymore for starters.

2050
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,840
Well, that's just fucking perfect.

2051
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:33,360
Well, that's not our fault.

2052
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:34,780
Like, we didn't do that.

2053
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,300
That's yours.

2054
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,580
You're the captain of the ship.

2055
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,660
Well, how is it my fault?

2056
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:40,240
Yeah.

2057
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,200
No, I'm just saying.

2058
01:11:41,220 --> 01:11:43,340
Conrad fucking threw money on the ship.

2059
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:45,300
Oh, hey.

2060
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,360
Did we do okay?

2061
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:47,560
Yeah, how we do, man?

2062
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,740
Oh, we do.

2063
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:49,600
He's laughing at us.

2064
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:52,480
You're getting to know these intrepid adventurers then.

2065
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,360
Yeah.

2066
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,840
Alex and his little brother Brad trying to swim with the big fish.

2067
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:57,920
Are we doing okay?

2068
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,140
Both seem out of their depth.

2069
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:01,640
Yeah.

2070
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:02,680
And Julia.

2071
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:03,540
Julia.

2072
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:04,720
The love of Alex's life.

2073
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,300
I don't know after what meant to.

2074
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:08,360
I don't know about that.

2075
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:14,460
It's not one diving trip that's going to destroy their relationship.

2076
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:15,980
I don't know what to do.

2077
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,480
And then there's Captain Fliss.

2078
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:18,640
Strong.

2079
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:19,960
Forthright.

2080
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:21,600
Stubborn.

2081
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:22,860
Stubborn.

2082
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:26,500
Do I detect a spark between her and Conrad?

2083
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,600
I don't know what I'm doing.

2084
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:32,320
I forced them to like each other.

2085
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,780
Wait, we have a special feature unlocked.

2086
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:36,680
What's the special feature?

2087
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,260
And some I think they may regret.

2088
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,220
His jacket looks like a giraffe.

2089
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:43,860
Like a cantaloupe skin.

2090
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:47,360
Apparently we made some decisions that they're going to regret, lady.

2091
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:47,880
No.

2092
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,560
I mean, they regret.

2093
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:53,460
I think you made some decisions that they're going to regret.

2094
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:54,780
No.

2095
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,220
It was like traveling through time.

2096
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:57,980
Oh, shit.

2097
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:04,640
Well, it was like traveling through time and accidentally ending up in a dimension where the past is underwater and like everything is covered in particles.

2098
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,640
I think Julia is stupid.

2099
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:06,200
Sharks?

2100
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:07,440
It was like a reef.

2101
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:10,220
It was like traveling to the past.

2102
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:10,640
I'm stupid.

2103
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,580
It was like traveling to the past, but everything is underwater.

2104
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,140
And everything is covered in particles.

2105
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:21,160
I can't believe there's sharks in the ocean.

2106
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,260
Did you know that?

2107
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:25,080
Sounds like you've had some experience with this kind of phenomenon.

2108
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:25,720
Yeah.

2109
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,980
I've been studying it for years.

2110
01:13:27,020 --> 01:13:27,740
I'll go look for them.

2111
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:30,660
I didn't even meet...

2112
01:13:30,660 --> 01:13:30,940
Oh, wait.

2113
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,660
I'm Brad now.

2114
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:33,300
Wait, who are you?

2115
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:34,860
I'm watching...

2116
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,500
Oh, I'm Julia.

2117
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:36,020
I'm Julia.

2118
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,220
You're Julia?

2119
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:39,580
You got the short end of the stick.

2120
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:40,620
You're like an open book.

2121
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:41,640
I'm going to eavesdrop.

2122
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:43,560
I can read you from a mile away.

2123
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:44,760
Something's up.

2124
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:45,220
Oh, wait.

2125
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:46,800
Why are you in my cutscene?

2126
01:13:48,060 --> 01:13:49,200
I can see you.

2127
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:49,800
I can see you.

2128
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:50,400
I don't know what's going on.

2129
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,660
Are you happy?

2130
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,140
Don't fuck this up.

2131
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:55,540
Privacy?

2132
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,960
Oh, he's telling you to leave.

2133
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:57,740
Okay.

2134
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:00,960
Don't worry.

2135
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,000
I'll watch from here.

2136
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:02,900
Yeah.

2137
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:03,560
Maybe.

2138
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:04,000
Yeah.

2139
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:05,260
Yeah.

2140
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:07,260
I think so.

2141
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,260
You think so?

2142
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,500
Or you know so?

2143
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:10,880
Oh, my God.

2144
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:11,400
Is everything okay?

2145
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,340
I see you in the car.

2146
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:13,540
Oh, my God.

2147
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:13,840
Yeah.

2148
01:14:16,220 --> 01:14:17,360
Is everything okay?

2149
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:17,880
Man.

2150
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,060
What are you going to do?

2151
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,920
Man, did you ruin a ten year relationship?

2152
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:22,680
Can we go from here?

2153
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:28,140
That's fine.

2154
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:28,760
It's fine.

2155
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:32,140
He's just staring.

2156
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:33,240
Look.

2157
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,360
When we get home, we can talk about some stuff.

2158
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,880
What do you mean, we can talk about some stuff?

2159
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:39,400
But, I mean, it's not like we're breaking up.

2160
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,460
Man, what are you doing?

2161
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,020
There are a whole eight to a relationship.

2162
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:43,540
Okay.

2163
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,940
Oh my god, this guy acts like an AI for real.

2164
01:14:51,380 --> 01:14:52,820
Brad is right there!

2165
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:58,780
Yeah, I got distracted.

2166
01:14:59,240 --> 01:14:59,940
Let's go get him.

2167
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:03,040
Wait, are they like making out downstairs?

2168
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,800
Are they?

2169
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,760
I did that, you're welcome, man.

2170
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:15,400
I worked so hard on this for you.

2171
01:15:15,460 --> 01:15:16,080
Jesus Christ, Conrad.

2172
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:21,000
What's going on?

2173
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,580
Sorry to interrupt your seven seconds in heaven.

2174
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:25,760
Oh yeah, the beers.

2175
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,600
I was just getting them now.

2176
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:28,160
What?

2177
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,720
We're not gonna address that?

2178
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,200
We're just gonna...

2179
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,900
Oh man, you worked so hard and I brought it home run.

2180
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,000
I brought it home for you.

2181
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:36,360
No, no.

2182
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:40,940
You tried to sabotage it after I worked so hard for it.

2183
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:42,380
It's a seven year relationship.

2184
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,280
If you weren't going strong, they would...

2185
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,120
My intervention would mean nothing.

2186
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,440
Maybe we can figure out why the plane was out of here.

2187
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:54,640
What happened underwater, man?

2188
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:55,620
Oh,

2189
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,560
search for the nav pad.

2190
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:02,480
Got the nav pad, DivemasterJ?

2191
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:04,180
Oh, no, not yet.

2192
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:04,680
What's that?

2193
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:05,760
What's the nav pad?

2194
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:07,540
Oh, this thing.

2195
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:09,080
You alright?

2196
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,140
You seem kind of preoccupied.

2197
01:16:11,220 --> 01:16:12,200
I'm grabbing it!

2198
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,020
I'm grabbing it!

2199
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,060
Wait, is this it?

2200
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:16,320
What is this?

2201
01:16:17,380 --> 01:16:18,880
I'm talking to my brother.

2202
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:22,460
What am I doing?

2203
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,280
Oh, I'm looking at the pictures.

2204
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:25,100
Wow!

2205
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,380
Ooh, fishies!

2206
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:31,160
Air Rescue Service.

2207
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:32,540
Conwin Islands.

2208
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,000
Oh, that's me.

2209
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:38,280
That's me.

2210
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:41,360
Oh, I can't wait.

2211
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:42,440
That's me.

2212
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,300
What are you doing?

2213
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:47,360
We're having a conversation with everybody.

2214
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:48,900
Except for Julia.

2215
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,060
Oh, sorry.

2216
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,140
I was looking at pictures.

2217
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:55,820
Oh.

2218
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,020
What?

2219
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:58,140
Yeah.

2220
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,920
Oh, I thought it was a tablet.

2221
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:03,920
What?

2222
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,620
See, I did that.

2223
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:06,660
I did that.

2224
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:07,100
What did you do?

2225
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:08,760
Oh.

2226
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,540
I'm making out with Alex right now.

2227
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:10,660
Yeah.

2228
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:11,780
Right here.

2229
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:15,640
Right here.

2230
01:17:15,680 --> 01:17:16,460
Wait, you kissed Alex?

2231
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:17,160
Yeah.

2232
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:19,220
You fixed it!

2233
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,060
You fixed the problem you caused.

2234
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:23,760
Well, yeah.

2235
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:25,400
No, I did it.

2236
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:27,220
I caused that.

2237
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:29,100
I mean, I caused the relationship to flourish.

2238
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:30,280
You did cause it.

2239
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:30,680
It's blooming.

2240
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:31,320
It's blooming.

2241
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:34,160
If you did decompress too fast, then you should go easy on the beer.

2242
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,140
Alex, I'm fine.

2243
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:37,280
I think if I got the Benz, I would know by now.

2244
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:38,340
I think I'm fine.

2245
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:38,840
Not always.

2246
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,700
Sometimes the Benz can be super delayed.

2247
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:43,760
It could be hours or a day or two.

2248
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:44,960
What's the Benz?

2249
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,340
Yeah, what's the Benz?

2250
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,380
It's when you come up from a dive too fast.

2251
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,320
Oh, yeah.

2252
01:17:50,380 --> 01:17:50,960
Decompression sickness.

2253
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:51,660
Oh.

2254
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:52,580
Nerd.

2255
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:53,220
Wow!

2256
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,200
That was in all caps!

2257
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:56,980
It's pretty serious.

2258
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,880
Divers get sick and die from decompression sickness every year.

2259
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:05,020
And that is why the good Dr. Conrad says drink them if you got them, cause either you're fine or you're gonna want a little something.

2260
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,100
I don't think I want to listen to Dr. Conrad.

2261
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:07,660
Yeah.

2262
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,420
I think Alex is an actual doctor.

2263
01:18:10,940 --> 01:18:12,540
Take orders from this guy.

2264
01:18:12,580 --> 01:18:13,260
Just drink a beer.

2265
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:14,500
Oh, no.

2266
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:15,700
I have to make the decision?

2267
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:19,020
Beer o'clock?

2268
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:20,500
Beer o'clock?

2269
01:18:21,620 --> 01:18:22,100
Nerd!

2270
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:23,660
Beer o'clock?

2271
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,480
Oh, my God!

2272
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:30,080
If she dies, it's on you!

2273
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:33,540
Manchurian gold.

2274
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:35,020
Literally docked.

2275
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,180
There's doctors or there's...

2276
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:37,580
Beer o'clock!

2277
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,320
Those are coordinates, alright.

2278
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:44,580
Let me listen to my brother who throws money at problems.

2279
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:45,660
Hey, I'm not Julia.

2280
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,600
You'll be Julia eventually, too.

2281
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:48,320
Wow.

2282
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:52,220
I had to be Julia to take care of the mess you made.

2283
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:55,500
Reckless.

2284
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,300
All of you.

2285
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,240
Excuse me?

2286
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,560
I told you to leave everything down there alone.

2287
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,500
Oh, come on.

2288
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:01,540
We've been through this already.

2289
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:02,840
I'm not talking about the law.

2290
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,540
Oh.

2291
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,660
Talking about curse.

2292
01:19:05,820 --> 01:19:06,320
Superstition?

2293
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:09,240
Superstition?

2294
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:10,240
Is that it?

2295
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:10,660
Really?

2296
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:11,820
Really?

2297
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,020
The dead don't sleep well in these waters.

2298
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:18,200
May sound silly enough to you all, but I was raised on this shit and it sticks.

2299
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:19,600
Ooh.

2300
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,380
Are you gonna call her like a liar?

2301
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:24,520
Yeah.

2302
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:28,800
Maybe it's not Julia being a Karen.

2303
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:29,740
Maybe it's you.

2304
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,900
No respect for anyone else's tradition.

2305
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:34,260
I just don't like Julia.

2306
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:36,620
I don't want anyone else to like Julia either.

2307
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:42,940
You think you can scavenge down there and it makes no difference, but every single thing you bring back has an essence.

2308
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,120
It's like a ghost you invite to the surface.

2309
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:45,800
Here we go.

2310
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,480
Oh my god, you're so rude.

2311
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,760
You never think about much of anything.

2312
01:19:50,060 --> 01:19:50,960
You're so rude.

2313
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,140
You made her rude.

2314
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:59,380
People drown in these waters and you have to respect their resting place.

2315
01:19:59,740 --> 01:20:00,140
Damn straight.

2316
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,380
Brett, you got a fun ghost story, right?

2317
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:03,760
Ooh.

2318
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,440
Oh, I do?

2319
01:20:05,780 --> 01:20:06,180
Do you?

2320
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:08,420
Come on, say a ghost story.

2321
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:08,560
Yeah, yeah.

2322
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:10,860
Once upon a time.

2323
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:12,680
Let's hear it.

2324
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,400
We can all use a good show.

2325
01:20:14,620 --> 01:20:15,800
Yeah, come on, let's hear it.

2326
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:16,060
Ooh.

2327
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,600
Yeah, let's hear it.

2328
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,220
Let's hear it.

2329
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:21,320
I bet you can spin a good yarn.

2330
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,280
It's kind of messed up, actually.

2331
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,140
Oh, okay.

2332
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:24,660
Yeah.

2333
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,300
Scare away, little bro.

2334
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:27,060
Okay.

2335
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,160
Here goes.

2336
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:30,060
This story is true.

2337
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,920
It happened right near here.

2338
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:33,500
In an old lighthouse.

2339
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:34,580
Classic setup.

2340
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,360
Wait, true story?

2341
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:37,560
Where'd you hear this?

2342
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,100
I thought Alex already knew the story.

2343
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:41,080
Why are you deciding?

2344
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,560
Like you don't know what's going on.

2345
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:43,120
A creepy old guy.

2346
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:46,200
Down by the dockside, I found an ancient old man.

2347
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:47,560
Skin like a leather book.

2348
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,280
Why did your wig go up?

2349
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,160
He told me his secrets.

2350
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,200
You're just a dolly.

2351
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:55,520
Here we go.

2352
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:56,020
Okay.

2353
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:58,180
The lighthouse stood atop an atoll.

2354
01:20:58,740 --> 01:21:00,300
Isolated from the rest of the world.

2355
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,000
A lone beacon in the night.

2356
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,420
Because it was a spooky lighthouse.

2357
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:07,500
The lighthouse keeper would hear the waves pounding the rocky shore.

2358
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,500
One misty morning, he comes upon a woman.

2359
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:11,840
Covered in blood.

2360
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:13,020
Women?

2361
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,080
He hurries to her aid and she falls into his arms.

2362
01:21:16,340 --> 01:21:16,800
Sobbing.

2363
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:20,380
As he hurries her back to the lighthouse, he asks where she's from.

2364
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,680
He doesn't waste any time.

2365
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:22,540
Smooth.

2366
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:25,140
Conrad, shut up.

2367
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:26,380
Yeah, shut up.

2368
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:26,980
Shut up.

2369
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:30,880
I live here.

2370
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:31,820
In the lighthouse.

2371
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:33,960
My parents are upstairs right now.

2372
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,060
Dun dun dun.

2373
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:37,540
The lighthouse keeper says, that isn't so.

2374
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,620
Of course, he's lived there alone for years.

2375
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:41,040
And the woman becomes hysterical.

2376
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,800
His pupils are so dire.

2377
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,920
So, they go to the top of the lighthouse.

2378
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:51,140
And there, splayed out on the floor, is a man and a woman brutally murdered with an axe.

2379
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:51,620
Oh my god.

2380
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:54,400
I mean, do people even use axes anymore?

2381
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:58,200
I'm just reporting the facts.

2382
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,400
I'm just reporting the facts.

2383
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:02,460
I'm just reporting the facts.

2384
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:04,360
Chopped up into little tiny giblets.

2385
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:04,720
Chopped up into little tiny giblets.

2386
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,240
Giblets?

2387
01:22:07,180 --> 01:22:08,560
It's a good story, man.

2388
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:10,180
It's a very good story.

2389
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:12,680
You know, sometimes you have to embellish the facts a little.

2390
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:14,980
Wow, you tell a better story then.

2391
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:18,800
You're literally the one that asked for the story.

2392
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:21,560
You're literally the one that asked for the story.

2393
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:21,680
Shut up.

2394
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:23,200
Come on, Zach.

2395
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:25,000
Say it was you.

2396
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:25,960
You did it.

2397
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,560
I'm gonna do relax.

2398
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,400
The woman says, it was my husband.

2399
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:32,320
And she turns to the closet.

2400
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,540
Says, he's in there.

2401
01:22:34,820 --> 01:22:36,180
Ah, yes, the husband.

2402
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,300
And that's why I've always been a little weary of marriage.

2403
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,100
So, the lighthouse keeper creeps into the closet.

2404
01:22:42,100 --> 01:22:42,640
No, Alex, no.

2405
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,760
Alex is putting his head in his hands right now.

2406
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:47,060
Sure enough, there's a man inside.

2407
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:47,700
What?

2408
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:50,140
But he's cut his own throat.

2409
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:50,660
Ugh.

2410
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,820
He looks closer to see the dead man's face in the dark.

2411
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:56,040
Closer.

2412
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:57,580
Closer.

2413
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:00,160
Oh my god, the uncanny.

2414
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:01,240
It's his own face.

2415
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:04,640
And then its eyes bulge out and screams.

2416
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:06,500
Whoa.

2417
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:07,520
What the fuck?

2418
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:09,400
What the hell?

2419
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:11,200
Where did that come from?

2420
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,200
I think Brad is possessed.

2421
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:14,280
Yeah.

2422
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,580
I think he's possessed.

2423
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,040
Holy shit.

2424
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:21,300
Oh, come on.

2425
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,040
That wasn't scary.

2426
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:23,800
Okay.

2427
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:27,880
Do better next time, Brad.

2428
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,020
Don't you pick better prompts next time.

2429
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:31,660
Wow.

2430
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:32,860
I saw you scream.

2431
01:23:32,940 --> 01:23:34,700
I saw the screams around me.

2432
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:38,200
One more beard before hitting the hay.

2433
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:39,480
What regular issues are these?

2434
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,820
Standard issue.

2435
01:23:42,280 --> 01:23:42,800
Regulatory.

2436
01:23:42,860 --> 01:23:45,040
I don't think I trust Conrad with anything.

2437
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,000
I don't either.

2438
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:46,860
Who invited this guy?

2439
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:52,760
He's like that type of guy that's like, I'm going to tell my dad what you said about me.

2440
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,200
Yeah.

2441
01:23:54,020 --> 01:23:56,400
Do we not notice the storm that's incoming?

2442
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,160
And we're on a tiny little boat that's going to capsize.

2443
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:02,640
Uh oh.

2444
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,420
I think we're in trouble.

2445
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,020
Now there's a storm.

2446
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:06,240
I think we're in trouble.

2447
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:09,760
Oh my god.

2448
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,640
I think we fucked up.

2449
01:24:12,780 --> 01:24:13,740
I think we messed up, yeah.

2450
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:13,880
Yeah.

2451
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:16,640
Uh oh.

2452
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,300
You think those guys are going to come back and take our ship?

2453
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:20,600
The fishermen?

2454
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:21,080
Yeah.

2455
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,400
What the fuck?

2456
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,480
Where did they come from?

2457
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,700
Did you bring stuff up to the ship?

2458
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:29,760
It was the tablet.

2459
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:31,880
You brought a tablet?

2460
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:33,440
That's why we looked at the gold.

2461
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:34,980
Uh oh.

2462
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,460
They have opposable thumbs.

2463
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:41,760
They're fine.

2464
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,420
We're fine.

2465
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:43,020
We're fine.

2466
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:45,000
They're looking over us.

2467
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:46,240
Is that the treasure?

2468
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,120
That looks human.

2469
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:50,140
Wait.

2470
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,000
Are they the pirates?

2471
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:51,920
Oh my god.

2472
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:52,360
He's got a gun.

2473
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,100
Oh my god.

2474
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:55,200
What do I...

2475
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:59,220
I tried right triggering but it didn't let me do anything.

2476
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:01,180
I think he's about to die.

2477
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:02,960
What did you do?

2478
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,680
Did you not do your quick time effect?

2479
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,820
I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to go.

2480
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,640
I couldn't figure out where I was supposed to go.

2481
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,120
Oh my god.

2482
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,780
I did my quick time.

2483
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:16,760
Oh my god.

2484
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,340
Oh my god.

2485
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,320
Look at where it's gotten you.

2486
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:20,320
You're still trapped too.

2487
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,880
Because you failed the quick time.

2488
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:26,410
From his head.

2489
01:25:30,190 --> 01:25:30,810
Where's Brad?

2490
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:32,690
Oh.

2491
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:33,590
There's Fliss.

2492
01:25:36,210 --> 01:25:37,150
Oh there they are.

2493
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:37,710
That's the fisherman.

2494
01:25:37,970 --> 01:25:38,570
That's the pirate.

2495
01:25:38,790 --> 01:25:39,470
I told you.

2496
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:40,530
This guy means business.

2497
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,190
Why did you piss him off?

2498
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:44,590
It's your fault they're here.

2499
01:25:44,910 --> 01:25:46,410
Because you pissed him off.

2500
01:25:46,410 --> 01:25:47,570
You threw money at them.

2501
01:25:47,670 --> 01:25:48,390
It's your fault.

2502
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,130
I can't control Conrad.

2503
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,030
I can't control Conrad.

2504
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:55,270
It's your fault.

2505
01:25:55,790 --> 01:25:56,710
Oh you're deciding.

2506
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,650
Okay Conrad.

2507
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:59,330
What's your genius idea this time?

2508
01:26:00,930 --> 01:26:01,990
What is she doing?

2509
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,450
She's crying on his...

2510
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:04,430
What is happening?

2511
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:05,150
What are you doing?

2512
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:05,610
I don't know.

2513
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:06,270
I don't know.

2514
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,410
What are you doing?

2515
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,250
What are you doing?

2516
01:26:11,210 --> 01:26:11,730
Oh.

2517
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:12,150
Oh.

2518
01:26:12,270 --> 01:26:13,790
But I missed my event.

2519
01:26:14,050 --> 01:26:15,130
And it's my fault.

2520
01:26:15,390 --> 01:26:15,930
I'm trying to...

2521
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:18,310
I'm trying to pee myself right now.

2522
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,980
Did you miss it?

2523
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:22,740
You missed it.

2524
01:26:24,780 --> 01:26:26,400
There was no...

2525
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:26,920
Okay.

2526
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:28,020
Oh no.

2527
01:26:28,120 --> 01:26:28,700
Oh no.

2528
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:29,840
I have to choose.

2529
01:26:29,960 --> 01:26:30,740
I have to choose.

2530
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:32,360
You do it then.

2531
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:34,000
You gotta see what I meant.

2532
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:35,380
Yeah.

2533
01:26:35,640 --> 01:26:36,500
I did it.

2534
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,080
And you do it.

2535
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:45,420
I had to choose between Conrad and Julia.

2536
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:47,720
Okay let me try this again.

2537
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:48,720
Let me try this again.

2538
01:26:48,720 --> 01:26:49,200
Oh my god.

2539
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,200
This really is... How did you do it?

2540
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:51,440
This is how we're gonna die.

2541
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:52,260
This is how we're gonna die.

2542
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:53,220
How did you do it?

2543
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:55,880
I right trigger and then I pull with the right.

2544
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:59,280
I'm trying but let me pull.

2545
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:02,360
Just use your right stick.

2546
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:03,540
I swear.

2547
01:27:04,240 --> 01:27:05,440
I'm doing it.

2548
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:06,340
I swear to god.

2549
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,580
I swear to god.

2550
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,540
Fliss will never be...

2551
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:12,580
Alright.

2552
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,160
You fucking do it again.

2553
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:14,880
I'll do it.

2554
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:15,280
I'll do it.

2555
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:15,860
I'll do it.

2556
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:17,380
I'll do it.

2557
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:17,800
I'll do it.

2558
01:27:17,940 --> 01:27:19,060
Okay watch this.

2559
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:19,820
It's so easy.

2560
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,280
How did you do that?

2561
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:23,220
How did you?

2562
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:24,480
How did you do it?

2563
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:25,500
Okay your turn.

2564
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:27,260
Never mind.

2565
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,880
Why is he bleeding?

2566
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:33,800
Where's Brad?

2567
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:33,880
Where's Brad?

2568
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,360
Oh no.

2569
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,860
I gotta turn the sound down again on this thing.

2570
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:42,540
It's so bad.

2571
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,120
I don't know what you said.

2572
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,040
How did you guys do it?

2573
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,460
Wow you let Fliss die because you couldn't un-gag her.

2574
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,240
I don't know what you said.

2575
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,060
How did you?

2576
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:57,860
How did you do it?

2577
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,420
Hahaha.

2578
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,820
What's the good news?

2579
01:28:06,980 --> 01:28:11,200
Oh my god Conrad.

2580
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:14,480
What?

2581
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:18,140
How's that good news?

2582
01:28:20,580 --> 01:28:21,900
Oh wait.

2583
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,900
I'm gonna untie him.

2584
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,520
We have to get free.

2585
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,280
Right now.

2586
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,700
Yeah come here.

2587
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:28,600
Come here Conrad.

2588
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:31,880
Put on some pants man.

2589
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,140
Wait did you have to hold?

2590
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:34,640
You hold down the right stick?

2591
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:35,280
Yes.

2592
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,060
Yes.

2593
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,600
Why did you say that?

2594
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:40,380
I told you.

2595
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:43,140
Look.

2596
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:46,100
I didn't realize you had to hold it.

2597
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:49,580
Who's the gamer now?

2598
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:52,260
You failed your quick time event twice.

2599
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,180
What?

2600
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,900
It was just the gun.

2601
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:56,680
Oh my god this guy.

2602
01:28:57,860 --> 01:28:58,860
Sit back down idiot.

2603
01:28:59,540 --> 01:29:02,140
Wouldn't they think it's weird that we're un-gagged?

2604
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,620
I know right?

2605
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:05,120
Oh what the?

2606
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:08,540
I succeeded my quick time event.

2607
01:29:08,620 --> 01:29:09,260
I did mine.

2608
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:10,040
I did mine.

2609
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:15,420
I stopped you from getting beat up.

2610
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,220
Conrad kind of deserves it though right?

2611
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:19,220
Wait Conrad's gone.

2612
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:20,440
Bye Conrad.

2613
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:21,460
Bye.

2614
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:24,620
Wait are you getting taken away?

2615
01:29:25,300 --> 01:29:25,840
Yeah.

2616
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,240
I'm seeing what's happening.

2617
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:27,980
Oh shit.

2618
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,780
Oh what's happening?

2619
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:38,260
Oh so like the guy was like you're fucked.

2620
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,660
Oh and then Conrad gets punched.

2621
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:41,620
I saw that.

2622
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:44,580
Oh where is he going?

2623
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:47,840
Oh my god they're taking him out.

2624
01:29:48,240 --> 01:29:50,440
I mean if they kill Conrad that's okay right?

2625
01:29:50,780 --> 01:29:51,900
They're beating Conrad.

2626
01:29:52,460 --> 01:29:54,300
We don't care about that right?

2627
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,140
I'm making Julia scared.

2628
01:29:59,140 --> 01:29:59,200
I'm making Julia scared.

2629
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,400
Okay what do you want?

2630
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:04,580
Okay what do you want?

2631
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:05,320
What are they talking about?

2632
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,960
Okay I didn't say fuckers.

2633
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,480
Wait they're actually killing Conrad!

2634
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,980
Wait they're actually killing Conrad!

2635
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:16,680
You did this!

2636
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:17,420
You did this!

2637
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:19,280
I just said what do you want?

2638
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:22,260
Y'all you pissed him off.

2639
01:30:22,260 --> 01:30:22,940
Uh oh.

2640
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,440
Oh wait they have the gun?

2641
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,420
Oh no it's a knife.

2642
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:27,780
Oh my god they're gonna kill Conrad.

2643
01:30:28,180 --> 01:30:29,000
I'm gonna say nothing.

2644
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:30,540
Don't say anything.

2645
01:30:30,780 --> 01:30:31,620
Oh my god they're gonna kill him.

2646
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:35,280
If I say something I feel like they're gonna get agitated.

2647
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:36,520
I got it.

2648
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:39,440
What is that?

2649
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:41,120
I saved Conrad.

2650
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:41,820
You're welcome.

2651
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,500
No why would you want to save Conrad?

2652
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,100
Cause you told me to.

2653
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:50,440
You literally told me to.

2654
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,360
Oh I got a cuticle cutter.

2655
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:54,760
I'm cutting the ropes.

2656
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,760
I'm gonna say nothing again.

2657
01:30:58,800 --> 01:30:59,260
Oh they're coming back.

2658
01:30:59,440 --> 01:31:04,120
I feel like if I say something they would agitate him more.

2659
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,300
Oh he's coming back.

2660
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:07,520
Hey welcome back Conrad.

2661
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:11,200
I'm back.

2662
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,300
I saved Conrad just for you Min.

2663
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:15,120
Cause you love Conrad so much.

2664
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:20,420
Yeah I wanna see him get us killed even in a different way.

2665
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,840
I feel like that.

2666
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:26,580
I feel like you have higher survivability.

2667
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,180
Oh my god.

2668
01:31:27,260 --> 01:31:27,940
He's dead.

2669
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,300
Alex why did you get up so slowly?

2670
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,240
You have no restraint.

2671
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,940
Shut the fuck up.

2672
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,460
Just open the door.

2673
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:40,620
Just open the door.

2674
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:41,280
Julia breaking heads.

2675
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:42,500
Not the other way around.

2676
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,040
Fliss sure seems to be getting buddy-buddy with him.

2677
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:47,960
Fliss sure seems to be getting buddy-buddy with him.

2678
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:49,180
Wait why is Fliss...

2679
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:49,900
What's going on your end?

2680
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,040
I'm with Conrad and Alex.

2681
01:31:52,300 --> 01:31:53,320
Oh you're with us?

2682
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:55,480
You're Conrad!

2683
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:56,800
No I'm Alex!

2684
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:58,320
I'm Conrad!

2685
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:01,980
No.

2686
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:04,520
But I'm sure he's fine.

2687
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:07,080
These guys probably just want money or something.

2688
01:32:08,680 --> 01:32:13,240
Man if I let Conrad die here I wouldn't have to be forced to play Conrad.

2689
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,740
Everyone has to play Conrad at least once.

2690
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:23,560
Everyone has to feel the shame of being Conrad.

2691
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:29,580
I thought by saving Conrad you would have to deal with Conrad later.

2692
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:33,360
No they knew that you liked him so much.

2693
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,620
They let you stay with him.

2694
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,340
I literally saved him for you!

2695
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,580
What did they do to Julia?

2696
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:40,660
Are you okay?

2697
01:32:40,860 --> 01:32:41,860
Are you okay little Julia?

2698
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:44,600
Hey hey are you okay?

2699
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,320
Are you okay little girl?

2700
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:47,720
They didn't touch me.

2701
01:32:47,740 --> 01:32:48,160
Okay.

2702
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,560
They asked about our parents.

2703
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:51,220
What?

2704
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:52,500
Oh.

2705
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,440
It's going to be a hostage situation.

2706
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,200
Yeah.

2707
01:32:59,020 --> 01:32:59,780
There you go.

2708
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:00,020
Nice.

2709
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:05,120
What if everybody dies but Conrad?

2710
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:07,160
Should we do that?

2711
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:08,020
Make it a bit worse?

2712
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,820
Our mission is to keep Conrad alive!

2713
01:33:10,820 --> 01:33:11,980
Keep Conrad alive!

2714
01:33:11,980 --> 01:33:13,020
Keep Conrad alive!

2715
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,720
Does he just count it?

2716
01:33:17,740 --> 01:33:18,560
Yeah.

2717
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:19,800
What is he counting?

2718
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:23,180
Oh I think he's seeing the time between the lightning and the thunder.

2719
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:23,780
Oh.

2720
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,120
That's smart.

2721
01:33:25,420 --> 01:33:26,300
Yeah he is.

2722
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:27,400
Wow.

2723
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:28,820
Spoken like a true Conrad.

2724
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:30,900
Wow.

2725
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,340
Nerd.

2726
01:33:31,700 --> 01:33:32,400
We came here on a boat.

2727
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:33,340
Maybe we can take it.

2728
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:33,880
Yeah.

2729
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:35,880
Yeah it's a speed boat.

2730
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:37,300
The main guy here.

2731
01:33:37,780 --> 01:33:38,660
He's got a gun.

2732
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:39,120
Uh oh.

2733
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:40,460
Uh oh.

2734
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:46,000
At least one of us can get on their boat.

2735
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:47,160
Get some help.

2736
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:49,320
We're gonna get on that boat.

2737
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:50,240
Right.

2738
01:33:51,280 --> 01:33:52,300
Okay I'm gonna say nothing.

2739
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,060
So you have to get on the boat.

2740
01:33:54,260 --> 01:33:54,480
What?

2741
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,480
Oh what do you think?

2742
01:33:58,520 --> 01:33:59,220
She's asking you.

2743
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:00,160
I can get out through the window.

2744
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,260
We gotta break these off first.

2745
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:01,600
Oh.

2746
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:02,560
That's you.

2747
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:03,100
That's you.

2748
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:04,440
We're gonna get through the window.

2749
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,780
Yeah good call!

2750
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:07,320
Good call!

2751
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:08,360
No Conrad!

2752
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,060
Conrad the goat!

2753
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,140
I said nothing!

2754
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:14,960
So you don't see me sneaking.

2755
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:18,240
Okay sneaking mission.

2756
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:20,300
Alright be sneaky.

2757
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,300
Oh no please.

2758
01:34:23,120 --> 01:34:24,880
I don't wanna be Conrad anymore.

2759
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:26,060
Three.

2760
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:27,300
No!

2761
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:28,780
Be Conrad!

2762
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:30,220
Uh oh.

2763
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:30,800
Uh oh.

2764
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:32,520
Go Conrad go!

2765
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:33,260
Go Conrad.

2766
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:34,200
Oh my god.

2767
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:34,940
Go Conrad go!

2768
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,440
Is this me?

2769
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,460
Is this my quick time event?

2770
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:39,120
Oh shoot.

2771
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:39,520
Ah!

2772
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:41,880
Don't fuck this up!

2773
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,340
I got it!

2774
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,200
Don't fuck this up!

2775
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,020
Get the scissors!

2776
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:44,860
Don't fuck this up!

2777
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:46,900
Don't fuck this up!

2778
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:48,900
I might have fucked it up a little bit.

2779
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:49,920
What did you do?

2780
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:52,360
I'm doing my quick time event right now!

2781
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:53,540
I thought it said X.

2782
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:55,620
Get out!

2783
01:34:58,680 --> 01:34:59,520
Oh Bradley!

2784
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:00,980
I'm escaping.

2785
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:02,560
Get out of here.

2786
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:03,340
Get out of here Conrad.

2787
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:03,900
Go live.

2788
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:05,580
Live a long life.

2789
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,160
I got it.

2790
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:10,600
I did it.

2791
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:10,900
I did it.

2792
01:35:11,100 --> 01:35:12,380
I think Liz is gonna die.

2793
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,520
I have a hostage.

2794
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:15,180
I have a hostage.

2795
01:35:15,460 --> 01:35:15,520
I have a hostage.

2796
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:17,960
I went escape.

2797
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,200
I didn't grab a knife.

2798
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:19,540
What?

2799
01:35:19,620 --> 01:35:20,080
What do you mean?

2800
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:23,360
What do you mean?

2801
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,260
What did you do?

2802
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:26,500
I have a guy hostage.

2803
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:27,380
I'm gonna kill him.

2804
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:28,040
Oh my god!

2805
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:29,100
There you are like Spiderman!

2806
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,080
Goodbye!

2807
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:35,280
Goodbye!

2808
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,280
Our Conrad's leaving!

2809
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,240
Wait!

2810
01:35:42,340 --> 01:35:43,320
I think they're gonna shoot me!

2811
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:43,940
Wait!

2812
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,760
I think they're gonna shoot me!

2813
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,460
Attack him!

2814
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:46,700
Attack him!

2815
01:35:48,940 --> 01:35:50,360
I don't care about you Julie!

2816
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,140
I tried.

2817
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:52,340
I really did try.

2818
01:35:52,620 --> 01:35:52,860
No!

2819
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:53,620
No!

2820
01:35:53,680 --> 01:35:54,260
Stop it!

2821
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:56,360
Oh my god.

2822
01:35:56,440 --> 01:35:56,960
Is he dead?

2823
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:57,940
Did you dodge it?

2824
01:35:58,640 --> 01:35:59,140
Conrad's escaped!

2825
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:00,620
We did it!

2826
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:00,900
We did it!

2827
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:02,820
Yeah!

2828
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:05,580
Conrad's gone!

2829
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:06,680
We did it!

2830
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,220
We did it!

2831
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,560
Conrad lived!

2832
01:36:14,840 --> 01:36:16,380
I live!

2833
01:36:16,380 --> 01:36:29,980
Thank god I was condarreded during the quick time of that.

2834
01:36:29,980 --> 01:36:30,960
I saved you!

2835
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,820
I could've shielded Julia!

2836
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,800
But I saved you instead!

2837
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:36,500
Yeah!

2838
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,840
Yeah, because you know we need her to save Conrad!

2839
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,740
He's gone!

2840
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,540
Oh my god!

2841
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:45,620
He's gone on his little big adventure!

2842
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:46,820
He's just Conrad!

2843
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:49,800
Oh my god, we did it!

2844
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,160
Guys, apparently...

2845
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,680
People were like, people usually never save Conrad.

2846
01:36:56,260 --> 01:36:58,580
He usually dies there!

2847
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,520
Conrad deserves better.

2848
01:37:05,180 --> 01:37:05,660
Conrad?

2849
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:09,920
We did it guys!

2850
01:37:11,420 --> 01:37:13,520
He's gonna be the hero in the end!

2851
01:37:14,420 --> 01:37:16,120
Oh my god, the sound effects.

2852
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,720
Can I turn the sound effects down real quick?

2853
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:23,840
Okay, I'm turning them down again.

2854
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:24,880
Oh my god.

2855
01:37:25,060 --> 01:37:27,340
I can't believe it.

2856
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,800
They're like, usually Conrad gets shot.

2857
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,120
I don't know how you guys...

2858
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:37,480
Um, we have our priorities straight.

2859
01:37:37,940 --> 01:37:38,660
Absolutely.

2860
01:37:39,060 --> 01:37:40,280
Okay, I'm good.

2861
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,800
The only two people who saved Conrad.

2862
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:46,980
Willingly.

2863
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:49,160
Not for like, completionist sake.

2864
01:37:52,580 --> 01:37:53,300
Okay.

2865
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:55,120
We're hostages.

2866
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,700
Cool, what do we do now?

2867
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:59,560
She's like, looking for him.

2868
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:00,380
What?

2869
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,000
Why do you make all the important decisions?

2870
01:38:04,340 --> 01:38:04,540
Connie!

2871
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:05,540
Alright!

2872
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,960
Shut the fuck up!

2873
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,200
Why can't you wipe the blood off your face?

2874
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:11,300
What?

2875
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:12,260
Why is she looking like this?

2876
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:12,960
We were only talking!

2877
01:38:13,140 --> 01:38:14,620
There's no harm in just talking.

2878
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:15,160
You wanna talk?

2879
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:15,560
Yeah.

2880
01:38:17,080 --> 01:38:18,780
We practically won the game.

2881
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,080
Cheat the body of cow.

2882
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:23,360
We have one survivor, so we basically won.

2883
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:24,820
I'm just gonna say it.

2884
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:26,960
Flitz has gotta be in on this.

2885
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:28,460
Jeez, guys.

2886
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:29,280
What?

2887
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:30,460
We travel in the same watch.

2888
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,840
We're in the same place as in the bus.

2889
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,380
I bet you told them about the Manchurian gold.

2890
01:38:38,140 --> 01:38:39,120
They're in cahoots.

2891
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,300
They don't even know about the gold.

2892
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,840
Why did you tell them about the gold?

2893
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:43,100
Oh my god.

2894
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:45,480
Well, Flitz, what do you have to say?

2895
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:46,940
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

2896
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:48,980
I just lost everything I have.

2897
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:50,360
And this is what you think?

2898
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,300
What do you mean you lost everything?

2899
01:38:53,180 --> 01:38:54,060
This is a trap.

2900
01:38:54,100 --> 01:38:54,660
I lost my boat.

2901
01:38:54,680 --> 01:38:55,560
This is my boat.

2902
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:55,940
Son of a asshole.

2903
01:38:57,360 --> 01:38:58,380
Put a cork in it.

2904
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,320
Oh my god.

2905
01:39:01,380 --> 01:39:03,520
Oh, dang it.

2906
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,140
That quick time event was to save Julia?

2907
01:39:12,780 --> 01:39:13,940
Oh, Flitz again.

2908
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,240
Cahoots, cahoots, cahoots.

2909
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:18,120
What happened to Brad?

2910
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:19,380
Talk to this guy.

2911
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,840
Brad is right next to me.

2912
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:23,760
Why not?

2913
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,180
Why won't you talk to me?

2914
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:27,340
Move the gun.

2915
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,640
Take the gun off of us.

2916
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:32,520
We should save Julia next.

2917
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:35,180
Save all of us.

2918
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,660
We'll save the worst people.

2919
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,640
They can have each other.

2920
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,420
Julia and her brother.

2921
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:42,400
They can have each other.

2922
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:43,720
What's going on, Alex?

2923
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:49,620
How bad is the storm?

2924
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:50,020
We need to keep an eye on Flitz.

2925
01:39:50,420 --> 01:39:51,240
She's helping them.

2926
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:52,160
She's gotta be.

2927
01:39:52,240 --> 01:39:53,040
You really think she is?

2928
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:55,600
Why are you like this?

2929
01:39:55,660 --> 01:39:57,260
Why are you like this, Alex?

2930
01:39:57,260 --> 01:39:59,680
What do you want?

2931
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:00,240
I don't know.

2932
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,220
I'm just talking to you, man.

2933
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:06,040
Should I provoke them, you guys?

2934
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:07,220
Or what should I do?

2935
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,740
I literally was compliant.

2936
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:12,800
I'm not.

2937
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:18,480
You're just a little kitten, ain't you?

2938
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:19,040
A kitten.

2939
01:40:19,220 --> 01:40:20,080
A Discord kitten.

2940
01:40:20,900 --> 01:40:21,980
You wanna test that theory?

2941
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:24,960
Come here.

2942
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:25,360
Come on.

2943
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:25,900
Talk to me.

2944
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:26,560
No.

2945
01:40:28,300 --> 01:40:29,620
Look, I'm being compliant.

2946
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:31,140
Look, he's being a little baby.

2947
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:32,140
That's enough.

2948
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:33,060
No talking.

2949
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:35,020
What the fuck are you doing down there?

2950
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:38,120
We need to try and make sure we don't die.

2951
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,520
Where are you?

2952
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:40,680
Oh, you're with Flitz.

2953
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,180
You're antagonizing the fucking other pirates.

2954
01:40:43,500 --> 01:40:45,160
Oh my god.

2955
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:47,620
Quick time event.

2956
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,120
Quick time.

2957
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,380
I got both of mine.

2958
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:53,680
Did you?

2959
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:54,960
I got mine, too.

2960
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:55,760
Okay.

2961
01:40:55,880 --> 01:40:56,300
Alright.

2962
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,400
I doubt it.

2963
01:40:59,180 --> 01:41:00,240
The water.

2964
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:02,240
Oh, my Titanic moment.

2965
01:41:04,200 --> 01:41:05,740
At least you're downstairs.

2966
01:41:05,940 --> 01:41:06,860
I'm upstairs.

2967
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:09,200
Our ship is flooding.

2968
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,040
We're gonna drown.

2969
01:41:10,660 --> 01:41:11,260
Get out.

2970
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:12,780
Wait, what's going on?

2971
01:41:12,980 --> 01:41:14,060
The ship is flooding.

2972
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:15,340
Oh my god.

2973
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:16,320
Oh my god.

2974
01:41:16,340 --> 01:41:16,820
There you guys are.

2975
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:17,800
We're drowning.

2976
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:18,600
We're drowning.

2977
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:19,160
We're drowning.

2978
01:41:19,400 --> 01:41:20,780
I'm gonna hold on.

2979
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:23,020
I'm gonna rescue Brad instead.

2980
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,920
Get out of here, Brad.

2981
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:26,280
Get out of here.

2982
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:26,540
Get out of here.

2983
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:30,900
I hope you guys are okay, because I had a choice to save, but I chose not to.

2984
01:41:32,940 --> 01:41:33,380
Hey.

2985
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:33,980
Hey.

2986
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:35,140
Move it.

2987
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:36,800
We're gonna drown.

2988
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,260
Now.

2989
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:39,700
Oh my god.

2990
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,480
Why was there so much water in there?

2991
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:44,700
Because we're in the ocean.

2992
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,920
The water's not supposed to go in the boat.

2993
01:41:49,460 --> 01:41:49,940
I had to help Brad.

2994
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,240
Good job looking after number one.

2995
01:41:51,740 --> 01:41:52,500
Real smooth.

2996
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,640
Great leadership, Flitz.

2997
01:41:55,600 --> 01:41:57,500
What did I do?

2998
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:59,940
I literally saved us by...

2999
01:42:00,640 --> 01:42:02,160
Brad can't help himself.

3000
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,100
He's a little baby.

3001
01:42:03,720 --> 01:42:04,320
Uh-oh.

3002
01:42:04,620 --> 01:42:05,440
Uh-oh.

3003
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,500
Oh my god.

3004
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:07,540
We found the ship.

3005
01:42:07,680 --> 01:42:08,400
We found the ship.

3006
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:08,900
Oh my god.

3007
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:09,640
We found Madonne.

3008
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:10,780
Yeah.

3009
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,540
There's Madonne.

3010
01:42:14,220 --> 01:42:14,900
There it is.

3011
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:15,340
Oh my god.

3012
01:42:15,380 --> 01:42:15,840
Get in there.

3013
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,880
Whoa.

3014
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:18,060
Oh.

3015
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:18,860
Oh.

3016
01:42:19,380 --> 01:42:19,940
Oh.

3017
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:20,520
Oh.

3018
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:21,120
Oh.

3019
01:42:22,060 --> 01:42:23,180
There's Madonne.

3020
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:25,160
The man.

3021
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:26,480
That was the man of him.

3022
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:27,540
The man of Madonne.

3023
01:42:27,740 --> 01:42:27,740
Yeah.

3024
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,360
That's the man.

3025
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:33,580
Oh my god.

3026
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:33,740
Wait.

3027
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:34,700
That wasn't Conrad.

3028
01:42:34,740 --> 01:42:35,440
You don't think, right?

3029
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:36,980
No, because...

3030
01:42:37,800 --> 01:42:39,120
I think it was Conrad.

3031
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:41,180
Everyone's still alive.

3032
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:41,820
Yeah.

3033
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:42,660
We did it.

3034
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,740
We did it.

3035
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,400
We're keeping people alive.

3036
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:56,840
I think he's disappointed.

3037
01:42:56,840 --> 01:42:57,380
He's disappointed in us.

3038
01:42:57,780 --> 01:42:59,640
I think he wanted Conrad to die.

3039
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:00,060
Yeah.

3040
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,480
You appear to have saved somebody.

3041
01:43:02,780 --> 01:43:04,920
A bold move that paid off.

3042
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:06,100
What do you mean?

3043
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:06,820
Conrad.

3044
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:07,780
Yeah.

3045
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:09,060
Does this make the rest of your group more vulnerable?

3046
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:10,680
I would have done it too if it would have been me.

3047
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,380
Yeah.

3048
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:12,340
It was a quick time event.

3049
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,320
I don't think you would have.

3050
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:15,300
I did all my quick time events.

3051
01:43:16,860 --> 01:43:17,720
Most of them.

3052
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:24,160
The kind-hearted creature I am, I'd like to offer you some forewarning of what's to come.

3053
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:25,100
Do you want to see it?

3054
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,040
Tempted?

3055
01:43:26,060 --> 01:43:26,280
Ooh.

3056
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,540
Oh.

3057
01:43:29,180 --> 01:43:30,140
We can decide.

3058
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:30,480
Ooh.

3059
01:43:30,780 --> 01:43:31,320
Wait.

3060
01:43:31,900 --> 01:43:33,120
Do you want to know or not?

3061
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,260
I want to know.

3062
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:34,560
Okay.

3063
01:43:34,620 --> 01:43:35,280
Let's know.

3064
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,000
I got to make a decision.

3065
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:37,420
Yeah.

3066
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,380
In agreement.

3067
01:43:39,480 --> 01:43:40,920
Clue it is.

3068
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:41,460
Yeah.

3069
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:42,440
Clue it is.

3070
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,520
The Merchant of Venice, Act 2, Scene 7.

3071
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:54,100
The Prince of Morocco pulls a scroll from the eye of a skull and reads, All that glisters is not gold.

3072
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:54,700
Glisters?

3073
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:57,420
Often have you heard that told.

3074
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:58,560
What the fuck does that mean?

3075
01:43:58,900 --> 01:43:59,180
I don't...

3076
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:00,760
What?

3077
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:01,420
Anyway.

3078
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:01,780
What?

3079
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:02,340
That wasn't a hint.

3080
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:04,120
That wasn't a hint.

3081
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:05,960
That's not even a bit.

3082
01:44:05,980 --> 01:44:06,940
It's barely a riddle.

3083
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:08,800
I presume you'll be good to get back to your story.

3084
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:09,340
What?

3085
01:44:09,480 --> 01:44:10,240
But here's the thing.

3086
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:13,840
Everything may not be entirely as it seems.

3087
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:14,840
And he quoted Smash Mouth.

3088
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:18,400
All that glisters is gold.

3089
01:44:22,620 --> 01:44:24,200
Probably shouldn't have said that.

3090
01:44:26,360 --> 01:44:27,780
Oh, don't be greedy.

3091
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,060
Mint, don't be greedy.

3092
01:44:29,820 --> 01:44:30,460
I'm not.

3093
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,460
It's you.

3094
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:31,940
It's you.

3095
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:33,640
Did you get the tablet?

3096
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:36,340
I had to to progress.

3097
01:44:37,660 --> 01:44:38,320
I think.

3098
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:39,160
Oh, yeah, I did.

3099
01:44:39,340 --> 01:44:40,420
You're Julia now.

3100
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:42,180
Oh, no.

3101
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:43,620
You're Fliss.

3102
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:44,640
Oh, I'm Fliss now.

3103
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,120
Okay, this is my first time being Fliss.

3104
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:47,480
Oh, no.

3105
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:48,180
Now I'm Julia.

3106
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,160
Now to fix the relationship you've ruined.

3107
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:53,920
Like I said.

3108
01:44:53,920 --> 01:45:00,400
If they were truly happy for those seven years, my little tiny decisions did nothing.

3109
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,500
But how many tiny decisions did you make?

3110
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:07,580
There was like...

3111
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:12,120
No decisions.

3112
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:14,920
Why are we going to that ship?

3113
01:45:15,240 --> 01:45:16,940
Why can't we stay in our little ship?

3114
01:45:17,260 --> 01:45:17,620
What is that?

3115
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:18,480
Oh, what'd they find?

3116
01:45:18,640 --> 01:45:19,680
It's a dynamite, isn't it?

3117
01:45:20,460 --> 01:45:20,980
What?

3118
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:21,880
I don't think so.

3119
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:22,600
What was that?

3120
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,980
Why did they suddenly decide to search in there?

3121
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,240
I know.

3122
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:27,780
That's what I'm saying.

3123
01:45:27,880 --> 01:45:29,620
Why can't we just stay in our tiny ship?

3124
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:32,180
Oh, it's an engine part.

3125
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:32,640
Oh.

3126
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:36,160
Come on, Julia.

3127
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:37,380
Oh, apparently it was sinking.

3128
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:39,620
What the hell is wrong with me?

3129
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,300
Yeah, that's what I said.

3130
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:45,540
And you were like, we're in the ocean.

3131
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,540
How was I supposed to know we were sinking?

3132
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:50,160
I thought just water got in.

3133
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:52,460
Oh, my God.

3134
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:57,100
We're all going to die in here.

3135
01:45:57,580 --> 01:45:59,420
Yeah, we're going to die in the ship of Madon.

3136
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,940
But we know Brad would live in the bathroom here.

3137
01:46:03,080 --> 01:46:05,880
No, that was the bathroom of the other boat.

3138
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:08,220
No, it was the bathroom of this boat.

3139
01:46:08,740 --> 01:46:09,800
No, I don't think so.

3140
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:11,740
Right?

3141
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:13,480
It was blue.

3142
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:14,560
The ship is blue.

3143
01:46:14,980 --> 01:46:17,020
Oh, we're walking now.

3144
01:46:17,340 --> 01:46:18,140
Oh, we are.

3145
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:19,240
I was going to say stay here.

3146
01:46:21,060 --> 01:46:23,480
Hey, remember you can walk faster, LB.

3147
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:25,240
Oh, LB, LB.

3148
01:46:25,940 --> 01:46:27,320
I'm walking, I'm walking.

3149
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:27,740
What's here?

3150
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:28,460
I'm walking here.

3151
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,200
I'm walking here.

3152
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:31,320
I got a thing.

3153
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:33,020
What is this?

3154
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:34,280
Guard duty.

3155
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:35,360
Oh, he's watching me.

3156
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:36,500
He's watching you.

3157
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:37,760
Hey, I was reading that.

3158
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:39,500
Yeah, stop reading.

3159
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,760
This guy sucks.

3160
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:43,140
You're supposed to be walking.

3161
01:46:43,280 --> 01:46:44,500
I'm walking barefoot.

3162
01:46:44,500 --> 01:46:45,440
I'm doing my job.

3163
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:46,920
I'm going to get tetanus.

3164
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:49,520
Oh, who are you walking to?

3165
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:50,620
This guy?

3166
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:51,120
Oh, I walk...

3167
01:46:51,120 --> 01:46:51,540
Oh, oh.

3168
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:52,680
He pushed me too.

3169
01:46:54,900 --> 01:46:56,640
Okay, my bad, my bad, my bad.

3170
01:46:56,900 --> 01:46:58,300
We're walking, we're walking.

3171
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,020
Apparently, we can't even walk right.

3172
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:05,420
Here we go.

3173
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,680
Oh, no, your little bracelet.

3174
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:08,500
Oh, my God, no.

3175
01:47:08,660 --> 01:47:09,860
No, my bracelet.

3176
01:47:09,940 --> 01:47:11,280
That's like $100,000.

3177
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:12,800
Daddy bought it for me.

3178
01:47:13,180 --> 01:47:15,240
That's like real gold.

3179
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:17,180
What's wrong with your head?

3180
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:21,700
Oh, that's a dead body.

3181
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,080
Am I able to walk?

3182
01:47:25,220 --> 01:47:25,960
Am I walking?

3183
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:26,660
Oh, I am.

3184
01:47:26,760 --> 01:47:27,700
Oh, wait, oh, yeah, we're walking.

3185
01:47:27,820 --> 01:47:28,680
Oh, I got pushed back.

3186
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:29,580
Sorry, I walked the wrong way.

3187
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:30,340
Are you okay?

3188
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:31,540
You look a little worried.

3189
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,060
What's wrong?

3190
01:47:32,160 --> 01:47:32,500
What's wrong?

3191
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:34,900
I don't know.

3192
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,120
Oh, Scooby, what do we do?

3193
01:47:36,260 --> 01:47:37,280
Scooby, Scooby, what do we do?

3194
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:38,200
Oh, gosh.

3195
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,580
Oh, Shaggy, I don't know.

3196
01:47:39,640 --> 01:47:40,360
Oh, gosh.

3197
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,960
I don't know about this, Shaggy.

3198
01:47:45,080 --> 01:47:45,400
All right, let's go.

3199
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,240
Raggy, Raggy, I don't know about this, Raggy.

3200
01:47:49,240 --> 01:47:49,460
I don't know about this, Raggy.

3201
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:49,500
I don't know about this, Raggy.

3202
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:50,480
Oh, wait.

3203
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:52,380
Wait, what is that?

3204
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:52,720
What is that?

3205
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:53,120
Hey, move.

3206
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,960
I want to see what the poster says.

3207
01:47:55,120 --> 01:47:56,880
The Mask of Madness.

3208
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:57,140
The Mask of Madness.

3209
01:47:57,140 --> 01:48:02,620
If you dare to look death in the eye, now showing in the mess hall.

3210
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:03,560
Whoa.

3211
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:04,660
Are you...

3212
01:48:04,660 --> 01:48:05,620
Do you see what I'm seeing?

3213
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:06,560
I'm in the dormitories.

3214
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:08,260
What are you seeing?

3215
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:09,800
I don't know.

3216
01:48:09,980 --> 01:48:10,700
I'm just walking.

3217
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,680
Well, I can...

3218
01:48:11,680 --> 01:48:12,680
There's an item here.

3219
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:13,600
Grab it.

3220
01:48:13,960 --> 01:48:15,380
Are these guys going to do this now?

3221
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:16,600
Why...

3222
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,060
Oh, there's Miller.

3223
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:17,620
Miller.

3224
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:19,480
Why are they, like, not...

3225
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:20,740
They're not supervising us anymore.

3226
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,720
I know.

3227
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:23,060
Where are they?

3228
01:48:23,300 --> 01:48:24,380
Oh, I can also look at it.

3229
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:24,920
What is it?

3230
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,220
It says, Miller.

3231
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,000
Miller.

3232
01:48:28,180 --> 01:48:29,260
I'm waiting for you here.

3233
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:30,360
I'm at the other side.

3234
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:30,780
Okay.

3235
01:48:30,820 --> 01:48:31,100
I'm coming.

3236
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:31,420
I'm coming.

3237
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:33,100
Master Miller?

3238
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:34,860
Oh, no.

3239
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:37,540
Oh, there's Alex.

3240
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:38,460
Oh.

3241
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:40,120
They're slow.

3242
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,380
Dude, just as slow as we are.

3243
01:48:41,420 --> 01:48:42,580
I don't think LB works.

3244
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:43,360
I'll be honest.

3245
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:44,360
I don't feel any faster.

3246
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:45,140
I don't think so, though.

3247
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:46,380
I don't think it works either.

3248
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,260
Why is every...

3249
01:48:47,260 --> 01:48:49,040
Why is he moving like he's one of us?

3250
01:48:49,040 --> 01:48:49,400
Like...

3251
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:49,460
Why is he moving like he's one of us?

3252
01:48:49,460 --> 01:48:50,360
I don't think he's moving like an NPC.

3253
01:48:50,380 --> 01:48:51,180
What were we supposed to do?

3254
01:48:51,340 --> 01:48:51,580
Oh!

3255
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:52,420
There's rats!

3256
01:48:53,860 --> 01:48:54,260
Rats?

3257
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:54,960
Rats?

3258
01:48:56,600 --> 01:48:57,000
Rats?

3259
01:48:57,020 --> 01:48:57,960
Where are the rats, Rocky?

3260
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:58,680
I didn't see any rats.

3261
01:48:58,980 --> 01:49:00,540
Oh, there's something over here.

3262
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:01,240
Oh.

3263
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:01,900
What's this?

3264
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:03,200
What's this?

3265
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:07,420
It's an internal memorandum.

3266
01:49:08,840 --> 01:49:10,400
Is it going to give us a hint?

3267
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:12,660
You're covering Patterson's guard duties tomorrow.

3268
01:49:12,860 --> 01:49:13,460
He is sick again.

3269
01:49:13,820 --> 01:49:15,420
Conveniently, it's always when he has guard duties.

3270
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:16,480
And hold 3A.

3271
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,420
First is 24 o'clock.

3272
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:19,440
Check the chart.

3273
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:19,880
Start for rotation.

3274
01:49:20,300 --> 01:49:20,660
Oh!

3275
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:21,520
Again?

3276
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:21,820
Oh!

3277
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:22,460
You found a secret!

3278
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:24,160
Maybe that'll help us.

3279
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:25,480
This is the third time this week.

3280
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:26,660
None of us like it down there.

3281
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,120
Maybe Patterson should buck up.

3282
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:29,440
Get...

3283
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,320
Just get on it.

3284
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:31,580
Okay.

3285
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,400
Maybe it'll...

3286
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:33,800
Oh, hello.

3287
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:34,980
Maybe it'll, like, help us.

3288
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:35,260
Hello.

3289
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,000
I want to look at the secret, too.

3290
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:38,840
Yeah, go look at the secret.

3291
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:40,920
I want to look at it.

3292
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:41,680
How do I look at the secret?

3293
01:49:41,680 --> 01:49:43,280
It might be in the menu now, right?

3294
01:49:43,620 --> 01:49:43,980
No!

3295
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:45,120
I think so.

3296
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:47,500
Yeah, I think you got the secret, so I don't have to look at the secret.

3297
01:49:47,500 --> 01:49:49,160
That's two for two secrets for me.

3298
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:49,440
Okay.

3299
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:49,560
Oh.

3300
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:50,680
Oh, son!

3301
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:52,060
You're involved, you see!

3302
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:53,500
Okay.

3303
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:54,660
All of you.

3304
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:55,440
There's lots of doors here.

3305
01:49:55,620 --> 01:49:56,220
Into the sea.

3306
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:56,280
Yeah.

3307
01:49:57,980 --> 01:49:59,320
Are they putting us in the brig?

3308
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:02,080
Wait, this is where we were, isn't it?

3309
01:50:02,100 --> 01:50:03,960
When we were Conrad and...

3310
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,820
No, we were never here.

3311
01:50:06,440 --> 01:50:07,760
I don't remember this area.

3312
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:09,140
Oh.

3313
01:50:09,180 --> 01:50:09,520
Oh!

3314
01:50:10,780 --> 01:50:11,580
We're locked in.

3315
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:12,100
Oh, my God.

3316
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:12,840
Hey!

3317
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:14,720
It's pitch black in here!

3318
01:50:15,340 --> 01:50:16,240
Give us the light!

3319
01:50:17,340 --> 01:50:19,080
Where did that light come from?

3320
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:19,440
It doesn't look like it.

3321
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:20,540
It doesn't look that dark.

3322
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:22,240
Yeah.

3323
01:50:22,440 --> 01:50:23,700
Oh, they gave us a flashlight!

3324
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:24,380
They're such nice pirates!

3325
01:50:24,380 --> 01:50:25,520
They're actually so nice!

3326
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:26,280
Yeah!

3327
01:50:26,740 --> 01:50:27,140
Wow.

3328
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:28,600
You know, pirates aren't that bad.

3329
01:50:28,680 --> 01:50:28,860
Yeah.

3330
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:30,600
I bet you weren't actually gonna shoot Conrad.

3331
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:33,680
She had a...

3332
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:33,780
Oh.

3333
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,140
Oh, my God.

3334
01:50:34,140 --> 01:50:35,520
Wait, how did we have a lighting?

3335
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:36,540
Oh, gosh.

3336
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:37,700
I almost missed that.

3337
01:50:39,660 --> 01:50:41,420
My controller was like in my lap.

3338
01:50:43,780 --> 01:50:45,040
How is that still good?

3339
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:46,400
Like, not waterlogged?

3340
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,640
I know.

3341
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:49,400
Wait, maybe it's because the ship never stopped.

3342
01:50:49,400 --> 01:50:49,420
Oh, my God.

3343
01:50:49,420 --> 01:50:50,000
This is a fucking place.

3344
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:51,000
It never went into the ocean.

3345
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,220
Manchurian gold.

3346
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:56,960
It has to have something to do with the Manchurian gold.

3347
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,740
We're not far from those coordinates.

3348
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:02,040
Anyone else creep the fuck out by this ship?

3349
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:03,100
Bradley.

3350
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:05,880
What's the ship's name?

3351
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:08,520
So, was Manchurian gold the name of the ship?

3352
01:51:09,020 --> 01:51:10,040
That'd be a weird name.

3353
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,060
I've seen some pretty weird names for ships.

3354
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:13,260
Man, I'm a man.

3355
01:51:13,260 --> 01:51:14,120
Maybe they took a vote?

3356
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:16,180
What's the ship's name?

3357
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,100
Oh, wow.

3358
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:18,760
Your relationship with Alex went down!

3359
01:51:19,060 --> 01:51:19,400
Oh, snap.

3360
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:19,640
What?

3361
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:20,620
How did it go down?

3362
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:22,600
I literally just asked about the ship's name!

3363
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:23,300
You're so...

3364
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,760
Okay, what is this relationship you're trying to save, huh?

3365
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:27,020
Brad went to get us help.

3366
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:28,040
We should wait for him.

3367
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,480
Wait for Brad.

3368
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:30,560
Um...

3369
01:51:31,780 --> 01:51:33,020
We should just leave.

3370
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:34,340
I didn't know that meant we...

3371
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:35,860
We need to call the Coast Guard, but the Duke's radio is shocked.

3372
01:51:37,680 --> 01:51:39,600
We gotta find a radio on this ship.

3373
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:40,380
Oh, yeah.

3374
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:40,780
Good luck.

3375
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:41,140
So...

3376
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:43,000
What's the status of the Duke?

3377
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:44,560
How would the radio still be working?

3378
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:45,500
I saw one of the goons...

3379
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:46,160
I know, right?

3380
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,640
It's been, like, out of commission for so long.

3381
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:49,380
I know, right?

3382
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:52,280
The Duke of Milan is a floating brick without it.

3383
01:51:52,860 --> 01:51:53,920
We need to get it back.

3384
01:51:55,240 --> 01:51:56,680
If I thought it was sinking.

3385
01:51:56,780 --> 01:51:58,100
If it was sinking, then...

3386
01:51:58,100 --> 01:51:59,880
Whatever they think they're gonna find on this floating coffin...

3387
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:00,760
Is the ship gonna be still there?

3388
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,060
We gotta take advantage and look around and find a way out of here.

3389
01:52:03,660 --> 01:52:04,040
Yeah, exactly.

3390
01:52:04,040 --> 01:52:04,760
I don't think it was sinking.

3391
01:52:05,300 --> 01:52:05,460
Fliss?

3392
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:06,720
I don't think so.

3393
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:08,060
You told me it was sinking!

3394
01:52:08,200 --> 01:52:09,340
That's why I agreed with you!

3395
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:14,920
You're the one that told me it was sinking!

3396
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:17,020
No, you said it first!

3397
01:52:17,620 --> 01:52:18,420
I didn't know!

3398
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:19,360
I was like, why don't we do this?

3399
01:52:19,360 --> 01:52:20,120
I was like, why don't we just stay in this ship?

3400
01:52:20,180 --> 01:52:22,520
And you're like, no, it's sinking, Toki.

3401
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,340
You know, you were working to get us out of here with these guys.

3402
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:24,180
Or whatever.

3403
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:25,340
But I...

3404
01:52:25,860 --> 01:52:27,540
I mean, obviously that's not true.

3405
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,540
They're being just as bad to eat as they are us.

3406
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:29,260
There was water!

3407
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:30,020
We were drowning.

3408
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:32,560
There's water everywhere!

3409
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,740
He's saying that he's sorry.

3410
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:36,200
Just get a fucking bucket!

3411
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:38,900
Oh my god, it was Julius who was just like, we're gonna drown!

3412
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:42,500
Oh, hey, we apologized to each other.

3413
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:43,620
Cool.

3414
01:52:44,040 --> 01:52:46,360
Well, after we were arguing with each other, they apologized.

3415
01:52:48,360 --> 01:52:48,820
What's that?

3416
01:52:49,040 --> 01:52:49,340
I don't know.

3417
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:50,580
We did our job.

3418
01:52:50,900 --> 01:52:51,740
I grabbed something.

3419
01:52:51,740 --> 01:52:52,540
Secure the room.

3420
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,160
Oh, I got something here, too.

3421
01:52:54,540 --> 01:52:55,300
Some glasses.

3422
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:55,920
I don't know.

3423
01:52:56,020 --> 01:52:56,960
We were too busy arguing.

3424
01:52:57,080 --> 01:52:57,300
I know.

3425
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:59,140
Okay.

3426
01:52:59,500 --> 01:52:59,940
Okay.

3427
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:01,040
How are you doing?

3428
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:01,460
What's this?

3429
01:53:01,580 --> 01:53:02,280
Oh, I found a secret.

3430
01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:03,560
Hey, baby doll.

3431
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,340
I miss you like crazy.

3432
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:09,060
Three months until my next leave and jumping into your arms.

3433
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:10,020
Three months.

3434
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:12,200
I've been on the shore leave with these guys.

3435
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:13,520
Had a few beers.

3436
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:14,600
But don't worry.

3437
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:16,220
I'm keeping everything ready for you.

3438
01:53:16,320 --> 01:53:17,720
If you catch my drift.

3439
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:19,320
How's life?

3440
01:53:19,340 --> 01:53:19,500
How's work?

3441
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:21,620
I hope that boss of yours is leaving you alone.

3442
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:27,440
I know you can take care of yourself, but I feel helpless being so far away and I want to keep you safe.

3443
01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:29,840
Skyden Miller was really freaked out.

3444
01:53:30,680 --> 01:53:33,720
I got a lot of time to think while I'm guarding the cargo holds.

3445
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,720
It's dark and spooky down there.

3446
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:41,100
Some of the other guys have seen a figure roaming around, but I've always got you with me to keep me safe, too.

3447
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:46,880
I'll be with you soon and get a job as a mechanic and we can get married and have two children.

3448
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,700
We'll be happy together forever.

3449
01:53:48,860 --> 01:53:49,300
We'll be happy together forever.

3450
01:53:49,300 --> 01:53:50,920
Love you so much, Miller.

3451
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:51,940
Oh my god.

3452
01:53:51,960 --> 01:53:52,440
There's Sam again.

3453
01:53:52,840 --> 01:53:54,640
Look at the picture on the wall.

3454
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,440
Look at the picture on the wall.

3455
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,860
Oh, what picture?

3456
01:53:57,920 --> 01:53:58,120
Come here.

3457
01:53:58,200 --> 01:53:58,680
This one.

3458
01:53:58,820 --> 01:53:59,560
This one right here.

3459
01:53:59,620 --> 01:53:59,820
Right here.

3460
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:00,780
Oh, okay.

3461
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:02,100
Is that going to give us a secret?

3462
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:02,640
Yeah.

3463
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:04,120
All right.

3464
01:54:04,140 --> 01:54:06,800
And like look at it and then like look up.

3465
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:08,320
Are you good?

3466
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:09,280
There you go.

3467
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:09,780
I don't know.

3468
01:54:10,620 --> 01:54:11,260
What's wrong?

3469
01:54:12,260 --> 01:54:12,800
What's wrong?

3470
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:14,040
I wonder what happened.

3471
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:14,900
All right.

3472
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:15,620
I'm looking up.

3473
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:16,920
Wait.

3474
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:17,740
It won't let me look up.

3475
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:18,200
What do you mean?

3476
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:18,840
With the right hand.

3477
01:54:18,840 --> 01:54:19,280
With the right hand.

3478
01:54:19,300 --> 01:54:19,580
It's analog.

3479
01:54:20,660 --> 01:54:21,500
It didn't let me.

3480
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:22,340
What?

3481
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,180
It didn't let me look up.

3482
01:54:24,280 --> 01:54:25,240
Oh, you missed the secret.

3483
01:54:25,420 --> 01:54:26,240
You missed the secret.

3484
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:26,980
I missed the secret?

3485
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:27,300
No.

3486
01:54:28,300 --> 01:54:28,660
Yeah.

3487
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:30,800
But I want to look at that too.

3488
01:54:31,540 --> 01:54:31,900
Move.

3489
01:54:32,700 --> 01:54:33,680
I'm listening to the...

3490
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:34,200
Do you know French?

3491
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:36,540
Yeah.

3492
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:37,340
Oui?

3493
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:43,480
He says, I don't have the tools to do as I say and that's all.

3494
01:54:43,780 --> 01:54:44,180
What the hell?

3495
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:44,700
You do know French?

3496
01:54:44,700 --> 01:54:45,000
I'm live translating.

3497
01:54:45,160 --> 01:54:46,040
Fuck you.

3498
01:54:46,100 --> 01:54:47,340
I'm live translating for you.

3499
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:47,920
Oh, okay.

3500
01:54:47,960 --> 01:54:48,200
Thanks.

3501
01:54:48,540 --> 01:54:49,280
Nothing actually.

3502
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:52,320
Hello, my urbex?

3503
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:55,000
Can you hear me?

3504
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:56,560
Yes.

3505
01:54:58,160 --> 01:54:58,800
Thanksuanx.

3506
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:01,480
Oh yeah.

3507
01:55:01,480 --> 01:55:02,920
Well, laughing like w成ming?

3508
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:04,060
Have a listen.

3509
01:55:04,060 --> 01:55:07,100
I don't feel like you're watching my talk anymore.

3510
01:55:07,460 --> 01:55:10,440
You know what I want to say?

3511
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:12,450
Can you play and exchange the code?

3512
01:55:13,090 --> 01:55:19,890
I don't know how, I don't know how.

3513
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:20,730
You will see.

3514
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:22,910
I'm talking to... the boyfriend.

3515
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:27,850
I'm still listening to these guys.

3516
01:55:36,790 --> 01:55:39,170
I'm telling him... I'm telling Alex about the ghost.

3517
01:55:40,230 --> 01:55:40,830
Oh, I'm gonna listen.

3518
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:46,390
Hold on, I'm stuck.

3519
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:49,330
I'm stuck, I can't get over there.

3520
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:49,670
Hold on.

3521
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:53,330
I'm stuck, hold on.

3522
01:55:55,070 --> 01:55:56,470
Hold on, I can't get over there.

3523
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:57,790
How did you get over there?

3524
01:55:59,150 --> 01:56:00,030
Hold on, I'm coming.

3525
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:01,910
LBLB.

3526
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:08,970
Yeah, I wanna know what the fisherman's gonna be doing.

3527
01:56:09,210 --> 01:56:09,490
Yeah.

3528
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:10,590
Oh, there you are.

3529
01:56:16,050 --> 01:56:18,310
Maybe they'll let us go if they find all that gold?

3530
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:21,750
Maybe they don't find any gold?

3531
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:24,590
This whole situation's gonna go really bad.

3532
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:24,750
What happened?

3533
01:56:24,930 --> 01:56:25,910
What happened?

3534
01:56:27,790 --> 01:56:28,830
What happened?

3535
01:56:29,210 --> 01:56:31,270
Alex just disappeared on my screen.

3536
01:56:32,930 --> 01:56:35,130
What did you do to Alex?

3537
01:56:36,870 --> 01:56:38,090
Oh my god.

3538
01:56:39,710 --> 01:56:44,690
This is a fucking old ship, but maybe it still has a radio that works.

3539
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:45,770
I doubt it.

3540
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:46,710
Maybe we'll find it.

3541
01:56:47,730 --> 01:56:48,510
The bridge.

3542
01:56:48,710 --> 01:56:49,750
That is very hopeful.

3543
01:56:49,750 --> 01:56:52,030
Where the fuck is Brad in all of this?

3544
01:56:52,310 --> 01:56:53,670
He's in the room somewhere.

3545
01:56:53,930 --> 01:56:54,910
The radio still works.

3546
01:56:55,150 --> 01:56:56,470
He's just existing.

3547
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:58,830
Okay, well we're not gonna do anything from in here.

3548
01:56:58,870 --> 01:57:01,070
We need to keep looking around and try to find a way out.

3549
01:57:02,030 --> 01:57:03,150
I can't look around.

3550
01:57:05,110 --> 01:57:06,370
Just be careful.

3551
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:09,130
Okay, in the end, we gotta make sure Julia survives.

3552
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:09,750
Yeah.

3553
01:57:10,350 --> 01:57:11,170
Alright, hold on.

3554
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:12,510
There was some stuff over here.

3555
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:13,330
Oh, there is.

3556
01:57:13,350 --> 01:57:13,890
There is over here.

3557
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:14,970
Oh, here.

3558
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:16,490
There's one over here.

3559
01:57:16,930 --> 01:57:17,610
I'm staring.

3560
01:57:18,310 --> 01:57:18,710
Where?

3561
01:57:18,710 --> 01:57:19,390
What's this?

3562
01:57:19,610 --> 01:57:19,850
Oh.

3563
01:57:20,790 --> 01:57:21,230
Oh.

3564
01:57:21,430 --> 01:57:22,250
You got it?

3565
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:23,090
You got this.

3566
01:57:23,490 --> 01:57:25,170
Yeah, I know how to hold now.

3567
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:28,130
You're pushing me out of the way.

3568
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:32,350
I did it.

3569
01:57:32,830 --> 01:57:33,990
I did it, Mint.

3570
01:57:34,190 --> 01:57:34,510
Nice.

3571
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:35,790
Nice.

3572
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:36,370
Oh, what's this?

3573
01:57:36,530 --> 01:57:36,610
Oh.

3574
01:57:36,930 --> 01:57:37,370
No!

3575
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:39,970
I found it.

3576
01:57:40,610 --> 01:57:41,470
A way out.

3577
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:44,450
That's the game we're playing.

3578
01:57:44,530 --> 01:57:45,630
A way out, everybody.

3579
01:57:45,830 --> 01:57:47,190
A way out.

3580
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:48,330
How am I?

3581
01:57:48,350 --> 01:57:48,690
Oh, there we go.

3582
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:50,990
Wait, what's this?

3583
01:57:51,230 --> 01:57:52,070
I wonder why it's abandoned.

3584
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:53,950
There's a newspaper.

3585
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:56,030
I'm going to see if I can get it off.

3586
01:57:56,830 --> 01:57:57,850
Secret found.

3587
01:57:58,150 --> 01:57:59,250
Wait, we're looking at the same secret.

3588
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:00,010
1947.

3589
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:02,450
Archaeologists missing in Iraq.

3590
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:06,650
24 British archaeologists have gone missing in the mountains of Iraq.

3591
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:13,550
The Hudson Expedition arrived in the kingdom in September last year with the starting goal unearthing and then...

3592
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:16,810
Oh, this must be the thing we found in the cargo.

3593
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:17,490
Yeah.

3594
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:18,670
This must be the thing we found in the cargo.

3595
01:58:18,670 --> 01:58:19,570
This could be the carnal thing.

3596
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:22,010
That's why they're all possessed and scared.

3597
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:22,450
Yeah.

3598
01:58:23,210 --> 01:58:23,950
They're cursed.

3599
01:58:23,970 --> 01:58:24,350
They're cursed.

3600
01:58:25,250 --> 01:58:25,930
This is cursed.

3601
01:58:27,030 --> 01:58:28,610
Is there anything else we missed in here?

3602
01:58:30,170 --> 01:58:30,950
Oh, what's this?

3603
01:58:31,410 --> 01:58:34,010
Oh my god, Bradley scared the crap out of us.

3604
01:58:34,010 --> 01:58:35,530
Oh my god, there he is.

3605
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:36,090
Right there.

3606
01:58:37,090 --> 01:58:39,170
Oh my god, he scared me so bad.

3607
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:41,250
He just doesn't do anything.

3608
01:58:41,390 --> 01:58:42,050
He's useless.

3609
01:58:42,270 --> 01:58:43,050
Yeah, I'm here to help you.

3610
01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:44,550
We know somebody that's not gonna survive.

3611
01:58:45,090 --> 01:58:45,990
I can't get it open.

3612
01:58:46,610 --> 01:58:47,490
We can get it open.

3613
01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:49,810
We're not keeping Bradley alive, right?

3614
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:51,130
No, Bradley can die.

3615
01:58:51,350 --> 01:58:52,270
Yeah, Brad's just gonna die.

3616
01:58:52,530 --> 01:58:52,750
Yeah.

3617
01:58:54,370 --> 01:58:55,690
Down with the nerd.

3618
01:58:57,290 --> 01:58:58,430
No nerds allowed.

3619
01:59:00,230 --> 01:59:00,710
Freedom.

3620
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:03,570
Oh, uh...

3621
01:59:03,570 --> 01:59:04,910
This is the way out.

3622
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:06,310
Yeah.

3623
01:59:06,870 --> 01:59:08,010
This is the way out.

3624
01:59:08,270 --> 01:59:08,590
Yeah.

3625
01:59:09,090 --> 01:59:10,030
I'm excited.

3626
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:10,310
Yeah.

3627
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:11,650
My excitement's going up.

3628
01:59:13,250 --> 01:59:14,350
Doki Bird is deciding.

3629
01:59:14,430 --> 01:59:15,470
Alright, I got this.

3630
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,390
No, I got this.

3631
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:18,010
Oh, yeah.

3632
01:59:18,050 --> 01:59:19,330
Someone should create a distraction.

3633
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:21,210
This is gonna be loud.

3634
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:22,190
Okay.

3635
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:23,910
Alex relationships.

3636
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,190
Oh, Julia goes up.

3637
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:26,990
Oh.

3638
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:28,350
What is she doing?

3639
01:59:28,490 --> 01:59:29,250
What is going on?

3640
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:29,750
Wait, wait.

3641
01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:31,790
Yeah, you make a distraction.

3642
01:59:32,230 --> 01:59:32,390
Fliss.

3643
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:32,870
Me?

3644
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:35,010
Yeah, why don't you do the distraction?

3645
01:59:38,630 --> 01:59:40,130
Um, I'm gonna distract.

3646
01:59:40,310 --> 01:59:40,890
Here I go.

3647
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:43,310
I hope Fliss doesn't die.

3648
01:59:46,610 --> 01:59:47,310
I'm back.

3649
01:59:47,830 --> 01:59:48,590
Bradley, get away.

3650
01:59:49,150 --> 01:59:51,190
Hey, you dumb, sweaty mongrel.

3651
01:59:51,530 --> 01:59:51,930
Whoa.

3652
01:59:52,030 --> 01:59:54,370
Maybe I shouldn't let you distract.

3653
01:59:54,430 --> 01:59:56,990
Yeah, hey, all that stuff she said, but double is gross.

3654
01:59:57,390 --> 01:59:59,130
Your mother's... It's your mother's mother, too.

3655
01:59:59,710 --> 02:00:00,150
Whoa.

3656
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:02,490
Don't talk about my mom.

3657
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:04,330
Oh, are you doing it?

3658
02:00:04,410 --> 02:00:05,490
I'm doing the quick time event.

3659
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:06,990
Oh, thank God I'm doing the quick time event.

3660
02:00:06,990 --> 02:00:08,570
Everyone of you smells like barrel of fish heads.

3661
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:09,230
That's right.

3662
02:00:09,390 --> 02:00:10,830
Your mother's all sucking.

3663
02:00:11,010 --> 02:00:11,510
Let us out.

3664
02:00:13,170 --> 02:00:14,830
Yeah, your mother's.

3665
02:00:14,830 --> 02:00:15,670
Your mother's.

3666
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:16,010
Yeah, dear.

3667
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:16,490
Yeah.

3668
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:18,510
Are they coming?

3669
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:21,710
Why are you screaming?

3670
02:00:23,290 --> 02:00:25,730
Because they don't want them to hear us doing the vent.

3671
02:00:25,870 --> 02:00:26,810
We're already done, Fliss.

3672
02:00:26,910 --> 02:00:27,210
Shut up.

3673
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:28,330
We're already done, Fliss.

3674
02:00:28,350 --> 02:00:28,850
Come on.

3675
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:29,670
What do you mean?

3676
02:00:30,450 --> 02:00:31,170
You're Fliss.

3677
02:00:33,330 --> 02:00:34,310
I'm not... I...

3678
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:35,250
Uh-oh.

3679
02:00:35,370 --> 02:00:36,170
Wait, what's going on?

3680
02:00:36,810 --> 02:00:37,610
Come on, Fliss.

3681
02:00:37,850 --> 02:00:38,210
Fliss.

3682
02:00:39,150 --> 02:00:40,030
Fliss, come on.

3683
02:00:40,030 --> 02:00:40,510
There you go.

3684
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:40,970
Nice.

3685
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:44,030
God, I can't believe she's not wearing shoes.

3686
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:45,590
Replace it.

3687
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:46,010
Replace it.

3688
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:46,850
Replace it.

3689
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:47,270
Replace it.

3690
02:00:49,090 --> 02:00:49,550
Yeah.

3691
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:50,470
They'll never know.

3692
02:00:50,550 --> 02:00:51,470
They'll never know.

3693
02:00:52,290 --> 02:00:52,990
Oh, no.

3694
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:00,870
Where did it go?

3695
02:01:01,010 --> 02:01:01,610
We're venting.

3696
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:03,270
Among Us?

3697
02:01:03,310 --> 02:01:03,950
Among Us?

3698
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:05,550
Oh, man.

3699
02:01:06,050 --> 02:01:06,910
Among Us?

3700
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:08,850
We're gonna get separated at some point.

3701
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:10,150
I feel like it too.

3702
02:01:10,350 --> 02:01:11,710
Find a way off the ship.

3703
02:01:12,030 --> 02:01:12,910
We need to keep going.

3704
02:01:13,590 --> 02:01:14,250
Come on.

3705
02:01:15,210 --> 02:01:15,990
There's gotta be...

3706
02:01:16,010 --> 02:01:16,990
There's gotta be some stairs around here.

3707
02:01:17,150 --> 02:01:17,410
Okay.

3708
02:01:18,230 --> 02:01:18,630
Okay.

3709
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:20,870
What's going on?

3710
02:01:21,090 --> 02:01:22,470
Wait, why am I holding the light?

3711
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:23,930
Wait, who am I?

3712
02:01:23,970 --> 02:01:25,130
Oh, wait, who am I?

3713
02:01:25,150 --> 02:01:26,030
What do you mean, who are you?

3714
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:26,710
You're always...

3715
02:01:26,710 --> 02:01:27,830
Wait, are you Alex?

3716
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:28,350
I'm Alex.

3717
02:01:28,570 --> 02:01:28,930
I'm Alex.

3718
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:29,570
Are you Alex?

3719
02:01:29,870 --> 02:01:30,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3720
02:01:30,510 --> 02:01:33,390
Now that we're... Oh, wait, there's something over here too.

3721
02:01:33,570 --> 02:01:34,370
There's stuff in here, yeah.

3722
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:35,450
They're all leaving.

3723
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:36,270
But we gotta...

3724
02:01:37,390 --> 02:01:39,070
We're splitting up already, guys?

3725
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:41,470
I found a piece of paper.

3726
02:01:42,090 --> 02:01:44,390
It's good to know that we're splitting up already.

3727
02:01:44,390 --> 02:01:47,410
I found the guard duty regulations.

3728
02:01:47,730 --> 02:01:48,410
They say...

3729
02:01:48,410 --> 02:01:49,830
I found the uniforms.

3730
02:01:51,310 --> 02:01:52,230
Wait, how do I...

3731
02:01:52,230 --> 02:01:52,550
Oh, there we go.

3732
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:54,910
Guys, nobody is allowed into 3A.

3733
02:01:55,130 --> 02:01:55,550
Seriously.

3734
02:01:55,970 --> 02:01:56,390
Nobody.

3735
02:01:56,410 --> 02:01:56,970
Okay, guys.

3736
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:58,870
I'm coming back.

3737
02:01:59,090 --> 02:01:59,610
Where are you?

3738
02:01:59,850 --> 02:02:00,770
No alcohol.

3739
02:02:01,690 --> 02:02:02,810
Where are you, man?

3740
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:03,330
Hold on.

3741
02:02:03,370 --> 02:02:04,490
I'm right by the front door.

3742
02:02:04,510 --> 02:02:06,150
The door we just... Here, look at me.

3743
02:02:06,210 --> 02:02:06,690
Turn around.

3744
02:02:07,230 --> 02:02:08,090
I'm turning around?

3745
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:09,590
You see me?

3746
02:02:09,670 --> 02:02:09,910
Where are you?

3747
02:02:10,070 --> 02:02:11,190
I'm right in front of you.

3748
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:11,750
Where are we?

3749
02:02:13,490 --> 02:02:14,750
I already went through that door.

3750
02:02:14,790 --> 02:02:15,490
There's nothing in there.

3751
02:02:15,570 --> 02:02:16,350
I already went through that.

3752
02:02:16,450 --> 02:02:17,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3753
02:02:18,670 --> 02:02:21,250
I think we're gonna get caught up by the pirates.

3754
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:23,410
No, why are you looking down like that?

3755
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:25,030
Why are you always looking down?

3756
02:02:25,050 --> 02:02:25,890
Oh, I'm sorry.

3757
02:02:26,030 --> 02:02:27,490
I'm trying to look at where I'm standing.

3758
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:30,110
I'm the one with the lights.

3759
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:31,150
I have a...

3760
02:02:31,150 --> 02:02:32,310
I have a flashlight too.

3761
02:02:33,450 --> 02:02:34,650
How do you have a... Oh, wait.

3762
02:02:34,670 --> 02:02:35,150
I found a map.

3763
02:02:35,290 --> 02:02:36,790
Why is the light flickering there?

3764
02:02:37,490 --> 02:02:38,650
That would have bounced.

3765
02:02:38,850 --> 02:02:39,450
What was that?

3766
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:40,890
Oh, okay.

3767
02:02:41,190 --> 02:02:43,810
So, Cargo Hole 2 is out of bounds.

3768
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:45,150
Oh, yeah.

3769
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:46,370
They didn't program that part.

3770
02:02:46,370 --> 02:02:48,170
Do you remember that?

3771
02:02:48,410 --> 02:02:49,970
Cargo Hole 2 is out of bounds.

3772
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:52,830
Yeah, when are we gonna get to Cargo Hole 2?

3773
02:02:53,030 --> 02:02:53,610
Wait, where do we go?

3774
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:55,430
Why was the light flashing over here?

3775
02:02:55,650 --> 02:02:56,850
Yeah, you first.

3776
02:02:59,590 --> 02:03:00,630
What's going on in here?

3777
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:01,790
What's going on?

3778
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:03,270
The lights actually work?

3779
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:05,310
Oh, my God.

3780
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:08,710
Wait, I'm in the bathroom.

3781
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:10,070
I'm in the bathroom.

3782
02:03:11,190 --> 02:03:12,090
I found the light in the bathroom.

3783
02:03:12,310 --> 02:03:13,070
Ladies first.

3784
02:03:13,790 --> 02:03:14,450
All right.

3785
02:03:15,310 --> 02:03:16,270
It's reading time.

3786
02:03:16,610 --> 02:03:19,350
Dear Eyeless, I'm finally coming home.

3787
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:20,210
This is it, darling.

3788
02:03:20,510 --> 02:03:24,190
One last trip across the Pacific and I'll be back to you and the girls.

3789
02:03:24,390 --> 02:03:26,030
I can't wait to see your faces.

3790
02:03:26,270 --> 02:03:28,230
Tell Ned and Nancy to get excited.

3791
02:03:28,450 --> 02:03:30,010
They're gonna see Daddy real soon.

3792
02:03:30,090 --> 02:03:31,430
And he's got gifts for y'all.

3793
02:03:31,670 --> 02:03:33,430
I'm sure glad to be back at sea.

3794
02:03:33,690 --> 02:03:36,710
It's hotter than an Oklahoma summer out there on the land.

3795
02:03:36,850 --> 02:03:38,290
And there's no escape from it.

3796
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:39,890
I've been all right.

3797
02:03:39,990 --> 02:03:42,290
Because I got your letters to keep me going.

3798
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:43,690
They censored them.

3799
02:03:43,870 --> 02:03:45,410
Which is probably for the best.

3800
02:03:45,590 --> 02:03:47,850
Because sometimes the others steal them to read.

3801
02:03:47,930 --> 02:03:49,890
And I don't like them reading our letters.

3802
02:03:50,150 --> 02:03:51,490
It really creeps me out.

3803
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:53,870
It keeps telling me there's a little boy on board.

3804
02:03:54,030 --> 02:03:54,950
And it sounds like Ted.

3805
02:03:55,130 --> 02:03:55,370
What?

3806
02:03:57,090 --> 02:03:59,190
Wait, Dokie, our feet are smelly.

3807
02:04:00,710 --> 02:04:02,150
Oh, we gotta go.

3808
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:03,150
We gotta go.

3809
02:04:03,330 --> 02:04:06,190
We gotta go.

3810
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:06,790
We gotta go.

3811
02:04:07,430 --> 02:04:09,090
I think that's the sign.

3812
02:04:09,310 --> 02:04:10,890
I think that's the sign.

3813
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:11,530
We gotta go.

3814
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:15,130
We gotta get out of here, man.

3815
02:04:15,130 --> 02:04:16,030
Guys, I think...

3816
02:04:20,990 --> 02:04:22,470
Where did they go?

3817
02:04:23,950 --> 02:04:24,530
Oh, this way.

3818
02:04:25,390 --> 02:04:28,310
I think the moment it starts getting smelly.

3819
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:29,970
That's when death is coming.

3820
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:31,330
And we split up.

3821
02:04:31,950 --> 02:04:33,610
No, no, they're right here.

3822
02:04:33,690 --> 02:04:34,110
They're right here.

3823
02:04:36,430 --> 02:04:37,510
They're right in front of me.

3824
02:04:37,590 --> 02:04:39,950
I like how we're the only ones with the flashlight.

3825
02:04:40,090 --> 02:04:40,550
And we're like...

3826
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:41,650
In the very back.

3827
02:04:43,730 --> 02:04:44,790
Oh, my bad.

3828
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:47,990
Time to explore.

3829
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:51,010
That's a lot of people who are suspiciously nowhere to be found.

3830
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:53,390
Yeah, there's something here.

3831
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:53,970
What's that?

3832
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:56,550
Are you picking it?

3833
02:04:57,310 --> 02:04:58,450
Are you picking it up?

3834
02:04:58,570 --> 02:05:00,550
I think it's a skull of a rat.

3835
02:05:01,490 --> 02:05:03,010
Oh, there's another thing here, too.

3836
02:05:03,230 --> 02:05:03,810
It's a rat skull.

3837
02:05:06,310 --> 02:05:08,030
A rat skull.

3838
02:05:08,030 --> 02:05:08,590
It's a rat skull.

3839
02:05:08,590 --> 02:05:11,010
Oh, my God.

3840
02:05:11,390 --> 02:05:14,090
I just got grabbed by a ghost hand.

3841
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:17,610
It was the loudest thing I've ever heard in my life.

3842
02:05:17,910 --> 02:05:18,930
It was the loudest thing I've ever heard in my life.

3843
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:21,950
Skipper has K.O'd the boost for this goddamn trip.

3844
02:05:22,210 --> 02:05:22,490
Skipper has K.O'd the boost for this goddamn trip.

3845
02:05:22,490 --> 02:05:23,810
Okay, none of this is...

3846
02:05:23,810 --> 02:05:25,570
Skipper, what the hell are you doing?

3847
02:05:25,830 --> 02:05:26,990
This lore is not interesting.

3848
02:05:27,130 --> 02:05:28,110
He's just talking about alcohol.

3849
02:05:29,750 --> 02:05:31,570
Can I turn down the...

3850
02:05:31,570 --> 02:05:33,690
Is it the sound effects that is what the music...

3851
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:34,730
It has to be the sound effects, right?

3852
02:05:36,190 --> 02:05:37,270
I think I'm gonna... hold on.

3853
02:05:37,390 --> 02:05:38,170
I'm turning it down.

3854
02:05:38,250 --> 02:05:39,390
I think it's the music.

3855
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:41,070
No, it's so bad.

3856
02:05:41,250 --> 02:05:42,030
I think it's the music.

3857
02:05:42,190 --> 02:05:43,510
It's going down to 35.

3858
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:44,710
You got the spooky.

3859
02:05:45,250 --> 02:05:46,710
You got the 35.

3860
02:05:47,370 --> 02:05:47,730
Yeah.

3861
02:05:47,750 --> 02:05:50,070
It was so loud.

3862
02:05:52,450 --> 02:05:53,730
Oh my god.

3863
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:56,330
Wait, how are you scared of ghosts?

3864
02:05:56,490 --> 02:05:57,650
You are a ghost.

3865
02:05:58,010 --> 02:05:59,130
I'm scared of jump scares.

3866
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:03,710
Yeah, but it's just your neighbor grabbing your hand.

3867
02:06:04,010 --> 02:06:04,810
I don't know every ghost.

3868
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:05,310
Look at our feet.

3869
02:06:05,390 --> 02:06:05,850
Look at our feet.

3870
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:06,650
Look at our feet.

3871
02:06:06,730 --> 02:06:08,150
I could grab... Wait, okay.

3872
02:06:08,230 --> 02:06:09,850
I wanna see what this jump scare is.

3873
02:06:10,170 --> 02:06:10,690
Oh yeah, yeah.

3874
02:06:10,790 --> 02:06:11,450
Do the rat.

3875
02:06:11,470 --> 02:06:12,030
Do the rat.

3876
02:06:12,510 --> 02:06:13,110
I'll do the rat.

3877
02:06:13,930 --> 02:06:14,630
I'm watching.

3878
02:06:14,730 --> 02:06:15,070
I'm watching.

3879
02:06:15,270 --> 02:06:17,630
Oh, I'm looking at it.

3880
02:06:17,730 --> 02:06:18,110
I'm watching.

3881
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:18,650
I'm watching.

3882
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:20,430
Am I going crazy?

3883
02:06:20,710 --> 02:06:21,850
I might be going crazy.

3884
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:22,510
There's nothing.

3885
02:06:22,970 --> 02:06:23,970
You lied to me.

3886
02:06:24,010 --> 02:06:24,750
There was nothing there.

3887
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:26,310
What?

3888
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:27,150
You're going crazy.

3889
02:06:27,150 --> 02:06:28,490
You didn't take your meds.

3890
02:06:28,630 --> 02:06:29,930
I have smelly feet.

3891
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:31,330
Dokia, I have smelly feet.

3892
02:06:31,390 --> 02:06:32,130
It's not my fault.

3893
02:06:32,770 --> 02:06:33,750
It's not my fault.

3894
02:06:34,870 --> 02:06:36,670
Someone here was lying.

3895
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:37,650
Uh-oh.

3896
02:06:37,850 --> 02:06:39,250
I found a picture frame.

3897
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:40,110
I think this is a clue.

3898
02:06:40,590 --> 02:06:41,670
Is this a premonition?

3899
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:42,070
Yeah.

3900
02:06:42,130 --> 02:06:43,610
Uh-oh.

3901
02:06:43,810 --> 02:06:44,330
Uh-oh.

3902
02:06:45,510 --> 02:06:46,250
What is it?

3903
02:06:47,230 --> 02:06:48,610
Here you might wanna... What's the premonition?

3904
02:06:48,630 --> 02:06:49,610
You might wanna look at that one.

3905
02:06:50,110 --> 02:06:50,510
Okay.

3906
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:52,990
We gotta make sure nobody dies.

3907
02:06:54,010 --> 02:06:55,030
Yeah, I think...

3908
02:06:57,850 --> 02:06:58,250
Oh.

3909
02:06:59,410 --> 02:07:00,030
Uh-oh.

3910
02:07:00,610 --> 02:07:01,010
Oh.

3911
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:02,810
Alright.

3912
02:07:02,910 --> 02:07:04,490
We gotta make sure Alex doesn't die.

3913
02:07:06,770 --> 02:07:08,010
But you're Alex.

3914
02:07:08,170 --> 02:07:09,530
It's in your hands.

3915
02:07:10,170 --> 02:07:10,730
It's me.

3916
02:07:10,730 --> 02:07:12,090
It's in your hands.

3917
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:12,790
No.

3918
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,330
I got... No.

3919
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:16,430
They already warned you how to save Alex.

3920
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,630
I don't know what was going on there.

3921
02:07:21,670 --> 02:07:23,070
Oh my god.

3922
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:24,790
Bradley doesn't have shoes either.

3923
02:07:25,010 --> 02:07:26,090
What's wrong with you guys?

3924
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:30,770
Min has to protect herself.

3925
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:32,210
It's not my fault.

3926
02:07:32,610 --> 02:07:32,890
Hey.

3927
02:07:33,630 --> 02:07:34,330
I'm dead.

3928
02:07:34,410 --> 02:07:36,490
So that means I couldn't protect myself from the beginning.

3929
02:07:36,650 --> 02:07:36,930
Oh my god.

3930
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:37,450
The flashlights.

3931
02:07:37,930 --> 02:07:38,710
Turn it off!

3932
02:07:39,030 --> 02:07:40,910
Turn it off!

3933
02:07:42,170 --> 02:07:43,210
There's someone down there alright.

3934
02:07:44,670 --> 02:07:45,110
Shh.

3935
02:07:45,110 --> 02:07:45,890
Everyone quiet.

3936
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:48,450
I'm the loudest whisperer ever.

3937
02:07:49,450 --> 02:07:50,350
Just turn it off.

3938
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:51,730
Why are you putting your hand over a flashlight?

3939
02:07:51,730 --> 02:07:52,650
Just turn it off.

3940
02:07:54,330 --> 02:07:55,310
Oh, there's the pirates.

3941
02:07:56,150 --> 02:07:57,630
Save the battery, man.

3942
02:08:00,470 --> 02:08:02,770
Could be those charging flashlights, you know?

3943
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:03,170
The...

3944
02:08:05,390 --> 02:08:08,450
The whirring ones.

3945
02:08:15,550 --> 02:08:17,050
We actually can get that?

3946
02:08:18,030 --> 02:08:20,130
Yeah, we gotta get that so we can leave, right?

3947
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:22,450
Oh no.

3948
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:23,050
Oh?

3949
02:08:25,410 --> 02:08:25,950
Oh?

3950
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:26,530
Oh?

3951
02:08:27,730 --> 02:08:29,190
He's gonna destroy it so nobody can use it.

3952
02:08:29,270 --> 02:08:29,710
Oh, nevermind.

3953
02:08:30,990 --> 02:08:31,670
What's he doing?

3954
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:33,290
He grabbed a weapon.

3955
02:08:33,590 --> 02:08:34,390
We need one.

3956
02:08:34,510 --> 02:08:35,370
He has a hammer, yeah.

3957
02:08:37,850 --> 02:08:38,290
Ummm...

3958
02:08:39,490 --> 02:08:39,930
Alright.

3959
02:08:40,470 --> 02:08:41,450
Grab it then, hurry.

3960
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:44,490
I don't need you barking on this big guy.

3961
02:08:46,670 --> 02:08:52,570
I swear to god, if I have to play Fliss because of that, I swear to god, man.

3962
02:08:54,450 --> 02:08:56,590
I swear to fucking god.

3963
02:08:57,730 --> 02:08:58,330
I swear to the player.

3964
02:08:58,690 --> 02:09:00,850
Well, she was the one who was like, I'm gonna go get it.

3965
02:09:00,910 --> 02:09:01,490
Okay, then go.

3966
02:09:04,110 --> 02:09:05,330
Oh, you're coming back in.

3967
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:06,830
Bradley's a hero now.

3968
02:09:07,330 --> 02:09:07,610
Brad!

3969
02:09:07,610 --> 02:09:07,890
Brad!

3970
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:08,770
Brad, don't do this!

3971
02:09:10,750 --> 02:09:13,010
Alright, who's gonna be Brad and who's gonna be Fliss?

3972
02:09:13,570 --> 02:09:13,990
Uh oh.

3973
02:09:15,250 --> 02:09:17,370
Alright, if I'm getting Brad, I'm making sure he dies.

3974
02:09:17,570 --> 02:09:18,190
Just so you know.

3975
02:09:18,310 --> 02:09:19,470
Oh yeah, if I get Brad, I'll do the same.

3976
02:09:19,550 --> 02:09:19,950
I'll do the same.

3977
02:09:22,890 --> 02:09:23,450
Oh my god.

3978
02:09:24,050 --> 02:09:24,330
Um...

3979
02:09:25,590 --> 02:09:26,630
No, I won't warn Brad.

3980
02:09:26,630 --> 02:09:27,750
I'm just gonna hide.

3981
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:31,970
Good luck, Brad.

3982
02:09:32,230 --> 02:09:32,550
Good luck.

3983
02:09:39,330 --> 02:09:40,610
Brad is the victim.

3984
02:09:42,770 --> 02:09:43,870
Oh my god.

3985
02:09:44,050 --> 02:09:44,970
07 Brad.

3986
02:09:45,330 --> 02:09:48,410
We were very clear that we don't want Brad anymore.

3987
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:53,110
Brad has been voted off the island.

3988
02:09:53,330 --> 02:09:53,970
Oh my god!

3989
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:55,350
Oh my god!

3990
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:56,690
Oh my god.

3991
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:57,970
Oh my god.

3992
02:09:58,070 --> 02:09:58,310
Uh oh.

3993
02:09:58,310 --> 02:09:58,570
Oh my god.

3994
02:09:59,090 --> 02:10:00,150
Oh no, Fliss.

3995
02:10:00,470 --> 02:10:01,390
Oh no, Fliss.

3996
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:02,070
Oh no.

3997
02:10:02,590 --> 02:10:03,930
He sounds really concerned.

3998
02:10:04,090 --> 02:10:04,730
Where are the others?

3999
02:10:04,830 --> 02:10:06,090
Oh no, Fliss.

4000
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:09,670
Oh no, the other pirates are coming over.

4001
02:10:09,850 --> 02:10:11,250
This is such a long cutscene.

4002
02:10:12,010 --> 02:10:13,810
Oh my god, don't gasp like that.

4003
02:10:14,270 --> 02:10:15,330
Oh wait, it's the gun!

4004
02:10:15,430 --> 02:10:16,210
It's the guy with the gun!

4005
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,050
Stop screaming.

4006
02:10:17,250 --> 02:10:18,310
I'm trying to hear what's going on.

4007
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:18,970
I'm not screaming.

4008
02:10:19,650 --> 02:10:20,390
Shut up.

4009
02:10:21,050 --> 02:10:22,810
I want to know where the others are.

4010
02:10:24,510 --> 02:10:24,890
Oh.

4011
02:10:25,530 --> 02:10:25,910
Oh.

4012
02:10:26,310 --> 02:10:26,630
Oh.

4013
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:26,950
Bye Fliss.

4014
02:10:26,950 --> 02:10:27,090
Oh.

4015
02:10:28,030 --> 02:10:28,410
Brad.

4016
02:10:28,730 --> 02:10:29,410
Oh my god.

4017
02:10:29,570 --> 02:10:30,190
Oh my god.

4018
02:10:30,190 --> 02:10:30,530
Who's Brad?

4019
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:31,370
Who's gonna be doing it?

4020
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:32,130
Who's gonna be doing it?

4021
02:10:32,250 --> 02:10:33,230
Who's gonna be doing it?

4022
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:33,650
Not yet.

4023
02:10:33,730 --> 02:10:34,110
No.

4024
02:10:34,110 --> 02:10:34,690
Oh my god.

4025
02:10:35,930 --> 02:10:36,310
Alright.

4026
02:10:36,910 --> 02:10:37,710
I see you.

4027
02:10:37,790 --> 02:10:38,750
Oh come on, Brad.

4028
02:10:38,890 --> 02:10:39,490
What the hell?

4029
02:10:42,010 --> 02:10:42,690
That's not us.

4030
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:43,270
That's not us.

4031
02:10:43,370 --> 02:10:43,870
It's the AI.

4032
02:10:44,270 --> 02:10:44,930
Yeah, it's the AI.

4033
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:48,670
Wow, you guys.

4034
02:10:48,750 --> 02:10:49,330
Come on.

4035
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:50,750
Don't let him out of your sight.

4036
02:10:50,910 --> 02:10:51,190
Okay.

4037
02:10:51,190 --> 02:10:52,690
Girl, you're holding a whole ass lantern.

4038
02:10:52,990 --> 02:10:53,710
Like they're gonna see you.

4039
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:54,610
I think it's our...

4040
02:10:54,610 --> 02:10:54,970
I think...

4041
02:10:54,970 --> 02:10:55,630
No, it's your fault.

4042
02:10:55,690 --> 02:10:57,610
You literally told Fliss to go down and...

4043
02:10:57,610 --> 02:11:01,970
I mean, she should've...

4044
02:11:01,970 --> 02:11:03,870
She was the one who brought it up in the first place.

4045
02:11:04,290 --> 02:11:04,370
Hey.

4046
02:11:04,370 --> 02:11:04,610
I got this.

4047
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:04,990
Rat.

4048
02:11:05,750 --> 02:11:07,170
That's a very sick rat.

4049
02:11:07,930 --> 02:11:09,090
Oh, you're Fliss?

4050
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:11,250
Am I Fliss?

4051
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:11,750
Yes.

4052
02:11:13,850 --> 02:11:14,450
Uh-oh.

4053
02:11:14,590 --> 02:11:15,390
We're split up.

4054
02:11:15,390 --> 02:11:15,770
Uh-oh.

4055
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:16,690
We're split up.

4056
02:11:16,910 --> 02:11:17,850
Wait, what are you?

4057
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:18,370
Who are you?

4058
02:11:18,410 --> 02:11:18,850
I'm Alex.

4059
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:19,570
I'm Alex.

4060
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:20,470
Are you Alex?

4061
02:11:20,610 --> 02:11:21,010
Yeah.

4062
02:11:21,030 --> 02:11:21,170
I'm Alex.

4063
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:22,690
Yeah.

4064
02:11:22,690 --> 02:11:23,230
Are you getting...

4065
02:11:23,230 --> 02:11:23,510
Are you...

4066
02:11:24,170 --> 02:11:24,930
Oh, no.

4067
02:11:24,970 --> 02:11:25,530
We're split up.

4068
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:26,770
Why do I need to see this now?

4069
02:11:27,450 --> 02:11:27,890
This is you.

4070
02:11:27,890 --> 02:11:29,050
Are they interrogating you?

4071
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:30,710
Are they torturing you?

4072
02:11:30,710 --> 02:11:30,870
No, we're just...

4073
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:31,710
We're just walking.

4074
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:32,830
We're walking somewhere.

4075
02:11:33,210 --> 02:11:33,550
Oh, okay.

4076
02:11:34,010 --> 02:11:34,590
I'm here.

4077
02:11:34,610 --> 02:11:34,750
All right.

4078
02:11:34,850 --> 02:11:35,770
We went somewhere else.

4079
02:11:35,770 --> 02:11:36,570
I might...

4080
02:11:36,570 --> 02:11:38,290
We might have these two die.

4081
02:11:38,550 --> 02:11:38,870
What?

4082
02:11:39,890 --> 02:11:42,330
Are you sacrificing Fliss so that...

4083
02:11:43,150 --> 02:11:44,430
No, Fliss is cool.

4084
02:11:44,490 --> 02:11:45,610
No, I said both of us.

4085
02:11:45,770 --> 02:11:46,570
You're the one that...

4086
02:11:46,570 --> 02:11:46,890
Go down.

4087
02:11:46,950 --> 02:11:48,110
Fliss, they're fucking...

4088
02:11:48,110 --> 02:11:49,330
Go down there.

4089
02:11:49,930 --> 02:11:50,770
No, she...

4090
02:11:50,770 --> 02:11:51,150
It was her.

4091
02:11:51,170 --> 02:11:51,430
It was her idea.

4092
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:53,570
She said, I'm gonna go down there and get it.

4093
02:11:53,610 --> 02:11:53,690
What's this?

4094
02:11:53,690 --> 02:11:54,050
And I said, okay.

4095
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:55,090
Do it.

4096
02:11:55,110 --> 02:11:55,230
Bet.

4097
02:11:55,470 --> 02:11:56,530
That's what I said to her.

4098
02:11:58,290 --> 02:11:58,930
Oh, my God.

4099
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:00,650
Julie looks really scary.

4100
02:12:00,910 --> 02:12:01,990
She just looks like a...

4101
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:05,170
She looks so scary just standing there in the middle of the walkway.

4102
02:12:05,870 --> 02:12:07,070
Yeah, we like Fliss.

4103
02:12:07,450 --> 02:12:08,730
We don't want Fliss to die.

4104
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:09,590
Oh.

4105
02:12:10,350 --> 02:12:12,390
You're the one that sent Fliss down there.

4106
02:12:12,390 --> 02:12:15,650
You had a choice not to send Fliss down there.

4107
02:12:15,730 --> 02:12:16,370
She probably...

4108
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:17,490
She wasn't gonna listen to me.

4109
02:12:17,550 --> 02:12:18,170
Let's be honest.

4110
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:19,390
She wasn't gonna listen to me.

4111
02:12:20,110 --> 02:12:21,150
She was gonna be like...

4112
02:12:21,170 --> 02:12:23,710
I'm going down there whether you want me to or not.

4113
02:12:23,790 --> 02:12:24,170
We don't know that.

4114
02:12:24,230 --> 02:12:24,870
We don't know that.

4115
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:26,030
You gave her the choice.

4116
02:12:27,310 --> 02:12:27,950
Oh, my God.

4117
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:29,910
Fliss wasn't telling you to do it.

4118
02:12:30,150 --> 02:12:30,850
No, she...

4119
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:31,510
No, she wasn't.

4120
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:32,670
She said, I'm gonna go get that.

4121
02:12:33,130 --> 02:12:36,650
And then my choice was tell her don't or go get it.

4122
02:12:37,590 --> 02:12:39,370
And she made her choice.

4123
02:12:39,530 --> 02:12:40,050
She should...

4124
02:12:40,050 --> 02:12:41,050
She could have been like...

4125
02:12:41,050 --> 02:12:41,350
Yeah.

4126
02:12:41,350 --> 02:12:42,610
But you said go get it.

4127
02:12:42,610 --> 02:12:43,810
You chose go get it, didn't you?

4128
02:12:43,830 --> 02:12:44,210
I'm stuck.

4129
02:12:44,250 --> 02:12:44,850
I'm stuck.

4130
02:12:46,170 --> 02:12:46,890
Hold on.

4131
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:47,630
Where's the door?

4132
02:12:47,890 --> 02:12:48,410
Hold on.

4133
02:12:48,530 --> 02:12:49,130
Okay, everybody.

4134
02:12:49,130 --> 02:12:49,870
I'm stuck.

4135
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:50,970
I'm stuck.

4136
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:52,830
You guys, I'm stuck for real.

4137
02:12:53,190 --> 02:12:55,210
How do I go through this door?

4138
02:12:57,870 --> 02:12:58,770
There's a dead guy.

4139
02:12:58,890 --> 02:12:59,610
There's a dead guy.

4140
02:12:59,890 --> 02:13:00,110
Uh-oh.

4141
02:13:00,690 --> 02:13:01,530
Dead person.

4142
02:13:01,730 --> 02:13:02,270
Oh, it was a...

4143
02:13:02,270 --> 02:13:03,170
It was just a hat.

4144
02:13:03,330 --> 02:13:03,650
JK.

4145
02:13:03,950 --> 02:13:04,370
Wow.

4146
02:13:06,610 --> 02:13:07,370
I'm stuck.

4147
02:13:07,430 --> 02:13:08,470
I'm so stuck.

4148
02:13:08,870 --> 02:13:09,970
How do I get through here?

4149
02:13:10,890 --> 02:13:13,330
So, we have a very paranoid gunsman.

4150
02:13:13,790 --> 02:13:14,230
Oh.

4151
02:13:14,330 --> 02:13:15,110
He's very scared.

4152
02:13:15,550 --> 02:13:16,730
Is he experiencing...

4153
02:13:16,730 --> 02:13:17,150
Oh, there we go.

4154
02:13:17,190 --> 02:13:17,510
Finally.

4155
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:18,670
Is he experiencing...

4156
02:13:18,670 --> 02:13:18,910
No.

4157
02:13:18,910 --> 02:13:19,110
I'm stuck.

4158
02:13:21,350 --> 02:13:21,790
Oh, I'm stuck.

4159
02:13:21,790 --> 02:13:22,310
What's going on?

4160
02:13:22,310 --> 02:13:23,630
What's going on on your side?

4161
02:13:23,990 --> 02:13:24,670
I'm fine.

4162
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:25,470
Everything's fine.

4163
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:27,310
I have a hat now.

4164
02:13:27,650 --> 02:13:27,990
Really?

4165
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:28,830
We've been here before.

4166
02:13:29,010 --> 02:13:29,610
We have?

4167
02:13:30,190 --> 02:13:30,630
Yeah.

4168
02:13:31,070 --> 02:13:32,110
I got Medan.

4169
02:13:32,630 --> 02:13:33,690
I got Medan's hat.

4170
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:34,530
What!

4171
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:36,190
You got the man.

4172
02:13:36,450 --> 02:13:37,050
Of Medan.

4173
02:13:37,050 --> 02:13:37,890
I got the man.

4174
02:13:39,910 --> 02:13:40,350
Wait.

4175
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:40,750
Hold on.

4176
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:42,130
There's gotta be stuff in here to find.

4177
02:13:42,170 --> 02:13:42,390
Right?

4178
02:13:43,350 --> 02:13:44,830
There's not a dead body in here.

4179
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:45,930
There's not a dead body in here.

4180
02:13:45,930 --> 02:13:45,950
There's not a dead body in here.

4181
02:13:46,010 --> 02:13:46,790
There's not a dead body.

4182
02:13:47,470 --> 02:13:48,990
There's screams on my end.

4183
02:13:50,950 --> 02:13:53,090
Take your meds, take your meds.

4184
02:13:55,170 --> 02:13:56,730
Don't look, it's fine.

4185
02:13:58,090 --> 02:14:00,150
There's scary stuff over here!

4186
02:14:00,830 --> 02:14:03,090
I just saw some organs, okay?

4187
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:03,750
Chill.

4188
02:14:03,950 --> 02:14:04,610
Calm down.

4189
02:14:04,930 --> 02:14:05,950
You saw organs?

4190
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:07,510
Yes, they were organs.

4191
02:14:07,670 --> 02:14:09,190
They were like live organs.

4192
02:14:09,550 --> 02:14:13,050
Somehow they were live in the... Wait, what?

4193
02:14:13,610 --> 02:14:13,830
You found a secret!

4194
02:14:14,950 --> 02:14:15,490
Oh!

4195
02:14:15,730 --> 02:14:17,540
I found... I'm having beef casserole.

4196
02:14:17,540 --> 02:14:19,740
Everything just ground to a halt on this one day.

4197
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:20,860
No way.

4198
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:22,380
The whole ship just stopped functioning.

4199
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:23,380
Tuesday was cereal.

4200
02:14:28,220 --> 02:14:30,040
Home fried potatoes.

4201
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:31,940
Boiled eggs.

4202
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,980
I found a body.

4203
02:14:34,980 --> 02:14:36,340
I found a body.

4204
02:14:38,700 --> 02:14:40,180
You're like, cereal!

4205
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:43,320
Back on jokey side, there's a body.

4206
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:53,900
That's not until... That's not until Fridays.

4207
02:14:54,100 --> 02:14:54,820
Come on.

4208
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:59,280
The body is not on the menu yet.

4209
02:14:59,320 --> 02:15:00,240
Wait, there's soup here.

4210
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:01,280
You want some?

4211
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:04,000
Oh.

4212
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:05,620
Soup du jour mademoiselle?

4213
02:15:05,620 --> 02:15:06,900
Soup du jour mademoiselle?

4214
02:15:06,900 --> 02:15:08,160
Oh, I found another secret.

4215
02:15:09,220 --> 02:15:10,640
Oh my god, Julia.

4216
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:13,780
There's no time for messing around.

4217
02:15:14,020 --> 02:15:14,540
Alex.

4218
02:15:14,680 --> 02:15:15,200
God.

4219
02:15:17,540 --> 02:15:18,920
No, the stinky feet is here.

4220
02:15:19,180 --> 02:15:20,200
Oh, I have stinky feet too.

4221
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:20,720
I just noticed.

4222
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:24,180
Oh, we're so... Oh my god, where are you?

4223
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,740
Why did we split up?

4224
02:15:26,080 --> 02:15:26,620
It's fine!

4225
02:15:27,920 --> 02:15:29,180
Oh, there's a child.

4226
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:30,120
I think there's running children.

4227
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:31,980
Okay, you're really in trouble.

4228
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:35,960
I haven't seen anything yet.

4229
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:39,060
I remember the last time there was running children.

4230
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:41,560
Uh oh.

4231
02:15:41,660 --> 02:15:42,740
Wait, so I heard something.

4232
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:43,740
What did I hear?

4233
02:15:44,820 --> 02:15:46,260
I found a notebook.

4234
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:47,740
It says...

4235
02:15:49,060 --> 02:15:49,800
Let's see.

4236
02:15:50,600 --> 02:15:51,500
Uh, nothing.

4237
02:15:51,640 --> 02:15:53,660
I can't even open... Open the notebook, idiot!

4238
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,160
I just... Oh, there we go.

4239
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:56,540
Oh.

4240
02:15:56,640 --> 02:15:57,740
Okay, it's a diary!

4241
02:15:58,360 --> 02:15:59,560
Oh, read it!

4242
02:15:59,700 --> 02:16:00,780
Read that diary!

4243
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:03,540
June 18th.

4244
02:16:03,540 --> 02:16:03,920
Wednesday.

4245
02:16:05,300 --> 02:16:09,280
We hadn't been at sea long and I'm sick of the damn food already.

4246
02:16:09,700 --> 02:16:12,400
That muck we ate tonight was a joke.

4247
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:15,800
The cooks do their best with what we got, I'm sure.

4248
02:16:15,880 --> 02:16:17,480
But man, I'd kill for something fresh.

4249
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:21,820
First thing I'm doing when I get home is having me a tall glass of milk.

4250
02:16:25,580 --> 02:16:26,540
June 19th.

4251
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:27,100
Thursday.

4252
02:16:28,260 --> 02:16:33,200
Every one of the US papers was talking about that massacre in Philly.

4253
02:16:33,420 --> 02:16:34,320
Are these guys American?

4254
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:40,500
All I'm saying is while you're reading this diary, our kidnapper fucking died.

4255
02:16:42,040 --> 02:16:42,560
.

4256
02:16:45,180 --> 02:16:50,080
I can't... I'm just like, listen, you ate the diary and a kidnapper disappeared.

4257
02:16:53,260 --> 02:17:02,900
It's crazy to think how we're out here traveling the world trying to keep our country safe and there's people killing each other in the streets back home.

4258
02:17:03,160 --> 02:17:05,680
I could sure use a beer after reading about home.

4259
02:17:05,820 --> 02:17:08,080
But the captain has issued a ban on booze.

4260
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:10,240
Guess I'll be counting sheep tonight.

4261
02:17:11,120 --> 02:17:12,180
Oh my god, there's more?

4262
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:12,960
Oh no.

4263
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:15,920
Oh my god, there's more.

4264
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:16,660
Oh!

4265
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:17,860
Secret?

4266
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:18,880
Who found a secret?

4267
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:19,960
Was it you?

4268
02:17:20,540 --> 02:17:22,920
Yeah, I found a secret!

4269
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:24,540
June 20th, Friday.

4270
02:17:25,140 --> 02:17:29,960
Some of the guys had a little wrestling competition in one of the cargo holds today.

4271
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:33,900
I did okay, but Wagner eventually knocked me out of it.

4272
02:17:34,020 --> 02:17:37,900
I joked he should be disqualified on account of his size, but no dice.

4273
02:17:37,900 --> 02:17:39,700
I like how you're reading it.

4274
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:41,540
I'm still trying to find a way out.

4275
02:17:41,660 --> 02:17:43,720
You're just standing there reading the diary.

4276
02:17:44,260 --> 02:17:46,720
It'd take a whole crowd of people to pin him down.

4277
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:50,160
He certainly ain't eating the same as the rest of us, that's for sure.

4278
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,680
June 21st, Saturday.

4279
02:17:53,540 --> 02:17:58,280
I'm sure the cargo we have in the hold has something to do with the squad that went missing.

4280
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:04,840
Their leader, Jones, heard a legend about a room full of ancient solid gold statues from a Manchurian child emperor!

4281
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:07,320
They were said to be cursed!

4282
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:10,180
But that sounds like a load of baloney!

4283
02:18:10,820 --> 02:18:11,780
It's the child!

4284
02:18:12,440 --> 02:18:20,220
Also, Min, I hope to God that you're heading over to where I'm heading over, because I'm progressing right now!

4285
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:20,840
I'm reading!

4286
02:18:20,940 --> 02:18:23,000
I'm progressing in knowledge, okay?

4287
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:26,460
I don't know if they found them, but they never did return from their mission.

4288
02:18:26,580 --> 02:18:27,600
Maybe they're returning now.

4289
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:29,900
Okay, that's all of it.

4290
02:18:29,980 --> 02:18:30,180
Cool.

4291
02:18:30,800 --> 02:18:31,480
Alright, cool.

4292
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:34,820
I got away, and, like, I'm back in the cargo hold.

4293
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:36,300
Oh, I'm, like, far.

4294
02:18:36,460 --> 02:18:37,320
I don't know where I am.

4295
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:37,680
I'm in the kitchen.

4296
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:38,260
Yeah, I could tell.

4297
02:18:38,660 --> 02:18:42,200
Oh, I got the knife!

4298
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:43,760
I heard something, though.

4299
02:18:43,780 --> 02:18:45,080
I think I'm starting to hear people.

4300
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:45,620
Uh-oh.

4301
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,020
Wait, I see a premonition picture!

4302
02:18:49,960 --> 02:18:51,040
I'm getting a premonition.

4303
02:18:51,340 --> 02:18:51,660
Oh?

4304
02:18:51,740 --> 02:18:52,720
I'm getting a premonition.

4305
02:18:52,780 --> 02:18:53,240
Right now.

4306
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:53,760
What was your premonition?

4307
02:18:53,800 --> 02:18:57,960
Mine was the one where, like, it was a guy in a hood with a stick.

4308
02:18:58,280 --> 02:18:58,780
Oh my God!

4309
02:18:58,860 --> 02:19:00,420
I just saw Bradley's death!

4310
02:19:01,320 --> 02:19:02,320
Wait, how does he die?

4311
02:19:02,380 --> 02:19:02,880
How does he die?

4312
02:19:02,900 --> 02:19:03,500
How does he die?

4313
02:19:03,540 --> 02:19:04,320
He gets stabbed!

4314
02:19:05,020 --> 02:19:07,180
Wait, I have the knife!

4315
02:19:07,980 --> 02:19:10,420
Wait, but it's someone... I just picked up the knife!

4316
02:19:10,520 --> 02:19:15,040
It's someone wearing a raincoat.

4317
02:19:15,620 --> 02:19:16,780
Why'd you pick up the knife?

4318
02:19:17,320 --> 02:19:19,860
No, he was the one that was holding the... I didn't know!

4319
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:21,660
I picked up the knife!

4320
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:24,080
I literally just picked up the knife while you said that.

4321
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,180
What just happened?

4322
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:27,740
There's something in here with us.

4323
02:19:28,400 --> 02:19:29,420
Bradley, what's going on?

4324
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:30,440
I zoomed in.

4325
02:19:30,640 --> 02:19:31,020
Did you hear anything?

4326
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:32,560
I picked up the knife!

4327
02:19:33,380 --> 02:19:34,040
I'm scared.

4328
02:19:34,300 --> 02:19:35,260
I know I saw something.

4329
02:19:35,360 --> 02:19:36,460
It was moving in the shadows.

4330
02:19:36,720 --> 02:19:37,720
Something's moving in the shadows.

4331
02:19:38,080 --> 02:19:39,260
It's probably just a rat.

4332
02:19:39,480 --> 02:19:39,700
Oh, Charles!

4333
02:19:40,820 --> 02:19:41,260
Rats.

4334
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:43,860
Probably just rats.

4335
02:19:44,640 --> 02:19:45,500
That's all it was.

4336
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:47,300
Don't fucking laugh at me!

4337
02:19:47,780 --> 02:19:49,720
My relationship with Julia went up!

4338
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:52,980
But she was really bitchy about it.

4339
02:19:54,340 --> 02:19:55,680
Alright, we've been here before.

4340
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:57,820
Oh my god, they split me and Brad!

4341
02:19:58,220 --> 02:19:58,860
What do you want to do?

4342
02:19:58,900 --> 02:19:59,300
Turn around?

4343
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:00,780
We've seen all this before.

4344
02:20:00,920 --> 02:20:01,920
Wait, I got split off!

4345
02:20:02,240 --> 02:20:03,200
Wait, you split up?

4346
02:20:03,240 --> 02:20:04,040
You're by yourself now?

4347
02:20:04,100 --> 02:20:04,280
Yeah!

4348
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:05,320
Yeah, I'm by myself!

4349
02:20:05,380 --> 02:20:06,700
The door closed on us!

4350
02:20:06,840 --> 02:20:06,880
Okay, no.

4351
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:07,360
Uh-oh.

4352
02:20:07,980 --> 02:20:08,880
Oh my god!

4353
02:20:08,920 --> 02:20:10,620
Wait, I'm in the room with the dead bodies!

4354
02:20:12,040 --> 02:20:12,680
Uh-oh.

4355
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:13,420
Uh-oh.

4356
02:20:13,420 --> 02:20:13,700
Which dead bodies?

4357
02:20:14,100 --> 02:20:14,560
Uh-oh.

4358
02:20:15,080 --> 02:20:16,060
Which dead bodies?

4359
02:20:16,360 --> 02:20:20,500
The, the, the, the ones that were carried on the ship at the beginning!

4360
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,280
Gotta get out of here too sweet.

4361
02:20:22,800 --> 02:20:24,160
Okay, so can we just get the fuck out of here?

4362
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:24,740
Oh my god, I'm going crazy!

4363
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:25,660
I couldn't pick the other option.

4364
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:28,180
Brad, Brad like, I'm seeing hallucinations!

4365
02:20:28,580 --> 02:20:28,880
Uh-oh.

4366
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:31,320
Oh my god, I'm with the bodies!

4367
02:20:31,380 --> 02:20:32,240
I'm with the dead body!

4368
02:20:32,400 --> 02:20:33,340
Oh, I can, look at that!

4369
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:34,860
I can observe every single body!

4370
02:20:35,140 --> 02:20:36,200
Oh god, I'm scared, I'm scared.

4371
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:37,540
Oh god, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared!

4372
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:40,580
We're both fucking up!

4373
02:20:40,640 --> 02:20:41,600
We're both fucking up!

4374
02:20:41,640 --> 02:20:42,600
I found the secret!

4375
02:20:43,460 --> 02:20:45,420
Wait, there's two bodies in here!

4376
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:46,640
There's two bodies!

4377
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:47,780
What the?

4378
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:49,220
What's this?

4379
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:50,940
Practically falling off.

4380
02:20:51,060 --> 02:20:52,020
Anyway, what does that mean?

4381
02:20:52,500 --> 02:20:52,980
Oh, that's a bullet.

4382
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:54,860
Um, is this even human?

4383
02:20:55,020 --> 02:20:55,560
What is this?

4384
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:56,480
Look at this.

4385
02:20:57,220 --> 02:20:57,920
It's insane.

4386
02:20:57,940 --> 02:20:58,760
What is going on?

4387
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:00,060
Is this even human?

4388
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:02,800
I just want to reunite with at least somebody.

4389
02:21:03,240 --> 02:21:03,380
I mean, is it ever human?

4390
02:21:03,380 --> 02:21:03,840
I don't want to understand.

4391
02:21:03,980 --> 02:21:05,320
What's the deal with this place?

4392
02:21:06,180 --> 02:21:06,620
Leave.

4393
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:08,360
Now!

4394
02:21:08,360 --> 02:21:09,160
Leave, leave, leave!

4395
02:21:09,460 --> 02:21:10,160
Leave, leave, leave!

4396
02:21:10,400 --> 02:21:11,760
Hold on, I'm not done yet.

4397
02:21:12,220 --> 02:21:13,320
I'm not done yet, Julia.

4398
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:15,420
Oh, there's zombies!

4399
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:17,780
Are you okay?

4400
02:21:17,880 --> 02:21:18,500
What's going on?

4401
02:21:18,580 --> 02:21:19,100
I'm not!

4402
02:21:23,060 --> 02:21:25,800
You found a secret and there's zombies!

4403
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:29,140
I'm just looking at the bodies!

4404
02:21:32,900 --> 02:21:33,600
I don't...

4405
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:34,960
I found another secret!

4406
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:36,280
I don't want to know.

4407
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:37,020
Let's get out of here.

4408
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:37,140
Save Brad!

4409
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:38,000
Save Brad!

4410
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:39,040
Save Brad!

4411
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:40,960
Save him!

4412
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:42,940
I got some serious locks in these caskets.

4413
02:21:42,940 --> 02:21:43,800
I got another secret.

4414
02:21:44,060 --> 02:21:45,040
Plus four for four!

4415
02:21:45,980 --> 02:21:47,040
What do you mean?

4416
02:21:47,280 --> 02:21:48,740
You're getting secrets!

4417
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:49,580
Woo!

4418
02:21:55,720 --> 02:21:57,180
What do you mean?

4419
02:21:58,140 --> 02:22:00,080
Hold on, there's something over here.

4420
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:01,320
Uh-oh.

4421
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:04,380
Something's gonna be behind here!

4422
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:05,480
Something's gonna be behind here!

4423
02:22:08,740 --> 02:22:10,360
There might be...

4424
02:22:12,100 --> 02:22:13,180
Brad might be dead.

4425
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:14,140
What?

4426
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:17,680
Wait, it's not letting me do it now.

4427
02:22:17,940 --> 02:22:17,980
Oh no!

4428
02:22:18,100 --> 02:22:19,640
I'm in the ballroom!

4429
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:20,360
Hold on.

4430
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:25,160
I remember what happens on Ghost Ship, not the ballroom!

4431
02:22:25,900 --> 02:22:27,100
It's okay, that was outside.

4432
02:22:27,300 --> 02:22:27,760
That was outside.

4433
02:22:28,080 --> 02:22:29,060
Wait, it's not letting me do it.

4434
02:22:29,140 --> 02:22:30,620
It was inside the ballroom!

4435
02:22:30,700 --> 02:22:31,900
I saw the movie!

4436
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:33,740
No, they were out on the deck!

4437
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:36,180
They were out on the deck and then that's when it happened.

4438
02:22:36,620 --> 02:22:37,680
They were dancing on the...

4439
02:22:37,680 --> 02:22:38,880
They were dancing in the ballroom!

4440
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:40,720
The ballroom's not a deck.

4441
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:42,000
Uh-oh.

4442
02:22:42,120 --> 02:22:42,940
It might be stuck.

4443
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:45,240
You guys hear that?

4444
02:22:45,740 --> 02:22:47,700
I'm trying to use... I'm trying to do this!

4445
02:22:47,780 --> 02:22:49,620
I'm trying to do this, but it's not letting me.

4446
02:22:49,620 --> 02:22:50,780
My right stick is stuck.

4447
02:22:51,500 --> 02:22:52,800
I think... press it?

4448
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:55,380
What is press?

4449
02:22:56,140 --> 02:22:58,160
I think I'm having a Doki Bird problem.

4450
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:01,140
You gotta wait until I progress.

4451
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:02,180
Keep holding the trigger.

4452
02:23:02,360 --> 02:23:02,780
I am!

4453
02:23:02,900 --> 02:23:03,300
I am!

4454
02:23:03,800 --> 02:23:06,460
It doesn't let me progress unless I hold the trigger.

4455
02:23:07,980 --> 02:23:08,460
Hmm.

4456
02:23:08,460 --> 02:23:09,760
Is it the left one maybe?

4457
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:10,100
No?

4458
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:10,600
Right?

4459
02:23:10,700 --> 02:23:10,860
Right?

4460
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:12,520
You're going through my problem now.

4461
02:23:12,580 --> 02:23:13,020
Yeah.

4462
02:23:15,240 --> 02:23:15,720
Good.

4463
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,120
Wait.

4464
02:23:16,120 --> 02:23:17,240
I don't think it'll let me...

4465
02:23:17,240 --> 02:23:17,460
Wait.

4466
02:23:17,500 --> 02:23:19,660
I don't think it'll actually let me progress unless I do...

4467
02:23:19,660 --> 02:23:19,840
Oh wait.

4468
02:23:19,900 --> 02:23:20,040
No.

4469
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:20,720
There's a room over here.

4470
02:23:20,740 --> 02:23:21,040
Never mind.

4471
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:21,400
Okay.

4472
02:23:21,440 --> 02:23:21,640
Let's go.

4473
02:23:22,900 --> 02:23:23,260
Okay.

4474
02:23:24,840 --> 02:23:25,560
Sorry guys.

4475
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:26,020
I tried.

4476
02:23:26,200 --> 02:23:26,880
I really did.

4477
02:23:27,100 --> 02:23:27,460
Alright.

4478
02:23:27,560 --> 02:23:28,140
Let's see.

4479
02:23:28,240 --> 02:23:29,120
What did you have to do?

4480
02:23:29,760 --> 02:23:30,240
Spin it.

4481
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:30,980
It was like...

4482
02:23:30,980 --> 02:23:32,660
I'm trying to open up a curtain.

4483
02:23:33,540 --> 02:23:34,560
Oh my god.

4484
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:36,660
Hold the stick I was!

4485
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:38,080
I'll try one more time.

4486
02:23:38,320 --> 02:23:38,560
Oh.

4487
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,160
There's a pentagram book.

4488
02:23:40,300 --> 02:23:43,780
There's like a sorcery Satan book in the ballroom.

4489
02:23:44,540 --> 02:23:45,220
That's not good.

4490
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:45,820
I don't know.

4491
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:46,880
I guess we'll never know.

4492
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:49,540
I read the spooky book.

4493
02:23:50,280 --> 02:23:50,480
Oh.

4494
02:23:50,740 --> 02:23:51,560
You caught...

4495
02:23:51,560 --> 02:23:52,300
You're cursing us.

4496
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:52,980
If we...

4497
02:23:52,980 --> 02:23:55,540
I read the spooky book and there's blood here.

4498
02:23:55,860 --> 02:23:57,260
There's blood in the ballroom.

4499
02:23:57,260 --> 02:23:59,000
You are seeing a whole lot of bad stuff.

4500
02:23:59,060 --> 02:24:00,420
I haven't seen anything.

4501
02:24:01,840 --> 02:24:02,620
That's on you.

4502
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:04,460
You nearly put me in this situation.

4503
02:24:04,980 --> 02:24:05,680
What do you mean?

4504
02:24:05,800 --> 02:24:06,680
I didn't do anything.

4505
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:08,080
Oh.

4506
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:10,360
I'm in like a really bad area.

4507
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:11,240
I feel like I'm...

4508
02:24:11,240 --> 02:24:11,500
Oh.

4509
02:24:11,740 --> 02:24:12,360
What the?

4510
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:13,680
Why so spick and span?

4511
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:14,120
Oh.

4512
02:24:14,280 --> 02:24:15,540
There's a blood fountain.

4513
02:24:15,700 --> 02:24:17,800
Why do I get all the bad stuff?

4514
02:24:18,260 --> 02:24:19,980
I think I see a corpse.

4515
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:20,740
Oh.

4516
02:24:20,840 --> 02:24:21,080
Fuck!

4517
02:24:21,860 --> 02:24:22,500
Oh my god.

4518
02:24:22,500 --> 02:24:22,700
Oh.

4519
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,780
There's really a blood fountain here.

4520
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:26,400
I can't take it.

4521
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:26,800
Wait.

4522
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:27,360
What's going on?

4523
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:28,160
Wait.

4524
02:24:28,180 --> 02:24:28,980
Now they're real people.

4525
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:30,980
Oh my god.

4526
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:31,660
What's happening?

4527
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:32,400
What's going on?

4528
02:24:32,640 --> 02:24:33,080
Oh.

4529
02:24:33,440 --> 02:24:34,040
What the?

4530
02:24:34,480 --> 02:24:35,320
I'm touching...

4531
02:24:35,320 --> 02:24:36,600
What the fuck?

4532
02:24:36,600 --> 02:24:37,360
Why are you touching me?

4533
02:24:37,680 --> 02:24:38,500
I touched it.

4534
02:24:38,540 --> 02:24:40,000
I touched it.

4535
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:41,260
You touched it?

4536
02:24:41,360 --> 02:24:42,540
You touched the bad thing?

4537
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:42,700
Oh.

4538
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:45,660
And you were telling me not to touch the bad thing when you're touching the bad thing.

4539
02:24:45,780 --> 02:24:47,420
I just booped a guy.

4540
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:47,960
Come on.

4541
02:24:48,040 --> 02:24:49,840
A dead body became alive.

4542
02:24:50,100 --> 02:24:51,080
Is that not bad enough?

4543
02:24:51,360 --> 02:24:53,240
I just went boop on his face.

4544
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:53,680
Oh.

4545
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:54,740
I see another premonition.

4546
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:56,400
Oh my god.

4547
02:24:56,740 --> 02:24:57,140
Wait.

4548
02:24:57,200 --> 02:24:57,660
What just happened?

4549
02:24:57,880 --> 02:24:58,200
Wait.

4550
02:24:58,220 --> 02:24:58,440
What?

4551
02:24:59,940 --> 02:25:01,740
Somebody's drowning on this one.

4552
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:02,280
We gotta hurry.

4553
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:02,880
Yeah.

4554
02:25:02,880 --> 02:25:03,420
I found a picture.

4555
02:25:04,620 --> 02:25:05,020
Oh.

4556
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:07,120
Okay.

4557
02:25:07,180 --> 02:25:08,060
I think I was too slow.

4558
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:10,060
Oh.

4559
02:25:11,180 --> 02:25:12,380
I turned on the lights.

4560
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:13,440
The lights are on now.

4561
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:14,620
Oh.

4562
02:25:14,640 --> 02:25:14,980
The lights are on.

4563
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:15,200
Oh.

4564
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:15,540
Oh no!

4565
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:16,460
It's the guy!

4566
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:18,060
It's the guy with the hammer!

4567
02:25:18,160 --> 02:25:18,760
He's after me!

4568
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:21,620
Oh wait.

4569
02:25:22,420 --> 02:25:23,060
I'm Bradley!

4570
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:24,840
Bradley?

4571
02:25:25,100 --> 02:25:25,460
Wait.

4572
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:25,940
Is he alive?

4573
02:25:26,100 --> 02:25:26,640
Bradley's alive?

4574
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:27,100
Yeah!

4575
02:25:29,250 --> 02:25:30,310
Why am I by myself?

4576
02:25:31,410 --> 02:25:31,890
That's right.

4577
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:32,570
I kept...

4578
02:25:35,530 --> 02:25:35,890
What?

4579
02:25:35,890 --> 02:25:36,250
Fliss?

4580
02:25:36,550 --> 02:25:37,810
I was following you.

4581
02:25:37,850 --> 02:25:38,830
He's like talking to it.

4582
02:25:38,870 --> 02:25:39,670
He's like, Fliss?

4583
02:25:39,670 --> 02:25:39,710
Hello?

4584
02:25:39,910 --> 02:25:40,290
Fliss?

4585
02:25:40,370 --> 02:25:40,410
Hello?

4586
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:41,950
Wait.

4587
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:43,370
Wait.

4588
02:25:43,430 --> 02:25:44,010
Where'd you go?

4589
02:25:45,710 --> 02:25:47,750
I think I was following you.

4590
02:25:48,230 --> 02:25:48,670
Fliss?

4591
02:25:49,790 --> 02:25:50,230
Fliss?

4592
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:52,790
I think I'm in trouble.

4593
02:25:52,990 --> 02:25:53,010
Oh!

4594
02:25:53,150 --> 02:25:53,790
There's a dead body!

4595
02:25:54,310 --> 02:25:54,690
Yeah.

4596
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:55,330
You are in trouble.

4597
02:25:55,330 --> 02:25:56,070
I left you there.

4598
02:25:57,650 --> 02:25:58,870
I'm gonna touch this guy.

4599
02:25:59,070 --> 02:25:59,790
I'm gonna touch this guy.

4600
02:26:00,810 --> 02:26:01,250
Don't.

4601
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:01,530
Don't.

4602
02:26:01,530 --> 02:26:02,410
Don't jump at me.

4603
02:26:02,470 --> 02:26:02,830
Why?

4604
02:26:03,010 --> 02:26:04,530
Am I taking the bullet out of it?

4605
02:26:04,570 --> 02:26:04,830
Ew!

4606
02:26:07,870 --> 02:26:08,310
Whoa.

4607
02:26:08,310 --> 02:26:09,450
You're definitely in trouble.

4608
02:26:09,530 --> 02:26:10,290
I left you there.

4609
02:26:10,470 --> 02:26:11,230
Why'd you do that?

4610
02:26:11,350 --> 02:26:11,950
Why'd you do that?

4611
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:13,970
I tried to save you.

4612
02:26:14,010 --> 02:26:14,950
I did quick time events.

4613
02:26:15,230 --> 02:26:15,470
What?

4614
02:26:15,610 --> 02:26:17,190
You said you were gonna kill...

4615
02:26:19,790 --> 02:26:21,290
Now I have to save myself.

4616
02:26:21,730 --> 02:26:23,150
Now I have to save myself.

4617
02:26:23,410 --> 02:26:24,410
I was scared.

4618
02:26:24,690 --> 02:26:26,050
I'm sure I just left you.

4619
02:26:27,610 --> 02:26:28,350
You know what?

4620
02:26:28,450 --> 02:26:31,070
I kept him alive so you had to play him.

4621
02:26:32,130 --> 02:26:33,230
I'm playing P.T.

4622
02:26:33,230 --> 02:26:33,530
actually.

4623
02:26:33,890 --> 02:26:34,110
Fliss, hey.

4624
02:26:34,730 --> 02:26:35,630
Who are you?

4625
02:26:35,630 --> 02:26:36,870
I'm playing P.T.

4626
02:26:38,150 --> 02:26:40,810
I'm following you but you have less clothes on.

4627
02:26:41,650 --> 02:26:42,130
Huh?

4628
02:26:42,690 --> 02:26:44,310
I think you're trying to seduce me.

4629
02:26:46,010 --> 02:26:46,750
I'm watching.

4630
02:26:46,850 --> 02:26:47,230
I'm following.

4631
02:26:47,550 --> 02:26:47,790
I'm following.

4632
02:26:48,830 --> 02:26:49,310
Wait.

4633
02:26:50,050 --> 02:26:50,950
What happened?

4634
02:26:51,250 --> 02:26:51,370
Fliss!

4635
02:26:51,550 --> 02:26:51,810
Oh!

4636
02:26:52,010 --> 02:26:53,510
She just disappeared.

4637
02:26:54,130 --> 02:26:54,790
She's back.

4638
02:26:54,910 --> 02:26:55,910
I think Fliss is a ghost.

4639
02:26:57,070 --> 02:26:57,550
Yeah.

4640
02:26:57,570 --> 02:26:58,530
That's what I saw too.

4641
02:26:59,110 --> 02:26:59,910
You saw yourself?

4642
02:27:00,510 --> 02:27:00,970
No.

4643
02:27:01,030 --> 02:27:02,230
I knew you were a ghost.

4644
02:27:02,230 --> 02:27:02,970
Oh.

4645
02:27:03,150 --> 02:27:04,270
I'm looking at the bullet again.

4646
02:27:05,810 --> 02:27:06,210
Oh.

4647
02:27:06,270 --> 02:27:08,130
This time it says my name.

4648
02:27:08,290 --> 02:27:08,610
No.

4649
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:10,090
It says Alex on it.

4650
02:27:11,150 --> 02:27:12,450
Is Alex gonna get shot?

4651
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,250
I think so.

4652
02:27:14,370 --> 02:27:15,010
Oh no.

4653
02:27:15,730 --> 02:27:16,650
Fliss, what does that mean?

4654
02:27:18,390 --> 02:27:19,230
Girl, what does that mean?

4655
02:27:19,230 --> 02:27:19,990
Do I open this again?

4656
02:27:23,630 --> 02:27:24,030
Nuke.

4657
02:27:24,070 --> 02:27:24,290
Oh!

4658
02:27:24,490 --> 02:27:25,170
Matura gold!

4659
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:27,210
You found the gold.

4660
02:27:27,470 --> 02:27:28,310
I found the gold.

4661
02:27:28,810 --> 02:27:29,910
Guys, we're gonna be rich.

4662
02:27:30,030 --> 02:27:30,670
Don't be greedy.

4663
02:27:30,770 --> 02:27:31,530
I'm up with the hint.

4664
02:27:32,230 --> 02:27:32,750
Are you playing P.T.?

4665
02:27:32,750 --> 02:27:33,610
I'm playing P.T.

4666
02:27:33,610 --> 02:27:33,790
real?

4667
02:27:37,570 --> 02:27:39,490
Now you know how I felt.

4668
02:27:39,810 --> 02:27:42,230
The guy with the gun is here now?

4669
02:27:42,370 --> 02:27:43,050
What's going on?

4670
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:45,030
This is why I kept Bradley alive.

4671
02:27:45,170 --> 02:27:45,910
I can't see.

4672
02:27:45,990 --> 02:27:46,530
You're in the way.

4673
02:27:47,570 --> 02:27:49,630
This is why I kept Brad alive.

4674
02:27:50,170 --> 02:27:52,350
Now you have to deal with it.

4675
02:27:54,290 --> 02:27:55,930
The body is now...

4676
02:27:55,930 --> 02:27:57,190
It has textures floating.

4677
02:27:57,390 --> 02:27:58,210
What is that?

4678
02:27:58,330 --> 02:27:59,950
What is that floating texture?

4679
02:27:59,990 --> 02:28:01,490
What is going on on your head?

4680
02:28:02,990 --> 02:28:05,610
The game is glitching a little bit, I think.

4681
02:28:05,690 --> 02:28:06,090
The game is glitching a little bit, I think.

4682
02:28:06,090 --> 02:28:09,010
Oh, the bullet turned into a slug and it's eating me?

4683
02:28:09,210 --> 02:28:09,250
Oh, the bullet turned into a slug and it's eating me?

4684
02:28:09,370 --> 02:28:10,550
Okay, okay.

4685
02:28:10,770 --> 02:28:12,830
Are you killing Bradley off right now?

4686
02:28:13,530 --> 02:28:14,730
Okay, okay.

4687
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:14,730
Are you killing Bradley off right now?

4688
02:28:14,730 --> 02:28:16,790
Oh, we got slugs on us!

4689
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:17,890
We got slugs on us!

4690
02:28:18,170 --> 02:28:19,210
Oh my god!

4691
02:28:20,370 --> 02:28:21,410
I'm exploring.

4692
02:28:21,930 --> 02:28:22,990
Yippee-ki-yay!

4693
02:28:24,670 --> 02:28:26,730
Oh, look at all these items.

4694
02:28:26,730 --> 02:28:27,430
I'm playing P.T.

4695
02:28:27,510 --> 02:28:30,810
Look at all these items around me.

4696
02:28:30,810 --> 02:28:32,230
Let me read some more.

4697
02:28:32,610 --> 02:28:33,230
Let me...

4698
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:35,190
Oh, I'm stuck.

4699
02:28:35,310 --> 02:28:35,750
Okay, never mind.

4700
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:38,430
Oh, look at all this lore.

4701
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:43,610
Okay, read it out loud.

4702
02:28:44,070 --> 02:28:44,770
What's the lore?

4703
02:28:44,910 --> 02:28:45,190
Come on.

4704
02:28:45,790 --> 02:28:47,170
Alright, I got a book too.

4705
02:28:48,010 --> 02:28:48,830
Oh my god.

4706
02:28:48,910 --> 02:28:53,350
The Stanford Operating Procedure for Handling Hazardous Chemicals.

4707
02:28:53,390 --> 02:28:55,290
Oh, are you ready for some science?

4708
02:28:55,510 --> 02:28:56,050
What the?

4709
02:28:56,110 --> 02:28:56,870
I put the book down.

4710
02:28:57,130 --> 02:28:59,750
This is my fourth time going through the same hallway.

4711
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:05,910
There's just blood on the ground and a bullet.

4712
02:29:06,390 --> 02:29:06,970
Let's see.

4713
02:29:08,050 --> 02:29:09,430
It says... Oh!

4714
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:10,410
It says, Ha!

4715
02:29:11,010 --> 02:29:11,490
Oh!

4716
02:29:11,510 --> 02:29:11,810
Ha!

4717
02:29:12,050 --> 02:29:13,310
Oh, I just saw Alex die.

4718
02:29:14,030 --> 02:29:14,670
Wait, what?

4719
02:29:14,970 --> 02:29:16,010
No, it's not really him.

4720
02:29:16,050 --> 02:29:16,930
I'm hallucinating.

4721
02:29:17,130 --> 02:29:17,490
Oh, okay.

4722
02:29:17,630 --> 02:29:18,290
Okay, that's good.

4723
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:21,930
Because we only want a crab to die.

4724
02:29:22,290 --> 02:29:22,790
Oh my god.

4725
02:29:24,370 --> 02:29:27,630
I fucked it up, but I'm pretty sure you can take it home.

4726
02:29:30,150 --> 02:29:31,550
You had every opportunity.

4727
02:29:34,250 --> 02:29:35,350
I was panicking!

4728
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:35,910
Oh!

4729
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:36,130
Oh!

4730
02:29:36,190 --> 02:29:37,010
That was a quick time event.

4731
02:29:37,030 --> 02:29:37,290
My bad.

4732
02:29:37,470 --> 02:29:37,750
Uh oh.

4733
02:29:38,130 --> 02:29:40,370
Oh, he might actually die.

4734
02:29:40,930 --> 02:29:41,330
Ow!

4735
02:29:42,710 --> 02:29:43,110
Wait!

4736
02:29:43,110 --> 02:29:44,310
Did you actually kill him?

4737
02:29:44,550 --> 02:29:47,490
I was adjusting the sound and I missed the quick time.

4738
02:29:47,610 --> 02:29:48,430
Oh no, he's fine.

4739
02:29:48,490 --> 02:29:48,870
He's fine.

4740
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:49,530
Oh, okay.

4741
02:29:49,770 --> 02:29:51,690
You can't die from a hallucination.

4742
02:29:53,070 --> 02:29:54,170
Okay, this is...

4743
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:55,510
What just happened?

4744
02:29:59,070 --> 02:30:00,310
Duh, you guys.

4745
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:02,990
No, we're in a different hallway now.

4746
02:30:03,070 --> 02:30:03,690
We made it out.

4747
02:30:04,870 --> 02:30:06,030
I can't believe it.

4748
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:07,470
You were given one quick time.

4749
02:30:07,530 --> 02:30:10,510
I had to do like 20 during that entire run.

4750
02:30:11,350 --> 02:30:12,190
You and...

4751
02:30:12,190 --> 02:30:15,770
You get one quick time event and you messed it up.

4752
02:30:15,850 --> 02:30:17,150
I was adjusting my sound.

4753
02:30:17,430 --> 02:30:18,410
Alex was so loud.

4754
02:30:21,010 --> 02:30:21,750
It's fine.

4755
02:30:23,530 --> 02:30:24,890
Don't worry about it.

4756
02:30:25,090 --> 02:30:26,070
Just worry about yourself.

4757
02:30:26,070 --> 02:30:28,830
Why are you so obsessed with what I'm doing on my end?

4758
02:30:30,670 --> 02:30:32,790
Oh, I feel like something's gonna come out now.

4759
02:30:34,890 --> 02:30:35,650
What's over here?

4760
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:38,690
Who's that?

4761
02:30:38,850 --> 02:30:39,630
I'm hearing screams.

4762
02:30:40,370 --> 02:30:40,810
Who's that?

4763
02:30:40,970 --> 02:30:41,270
Get away!

4764
02:30:42,230 --> 02:30:43,750
I don't even know where to go.

4765
02:30:44,230 --> 02:30:44,990
Where do I go?

4766
02:30:45,470 --> 02:30:46,210
I don't know either.

4767
02:30:46,450 --> 02:30:47,590
I'm just... drop down?

4768
02:30:47,710 --> 02:30:47,890
I'm stuck.

4769
02:30:48,290 --> 02:30:49,370
Gosh, there's so much to do.

4770
02:30:49,450 --> 02:30:50,110
There's so many options.

4771
02:30:50,470 --> 02:30:50,950
This is really cool.

4772
02:30:51,010 --> 02:30:51,410
Skeletons.

4773
02:30:51,770 --> 02:30:53,190
This is really choose your own adventure.

4774
02:30:53,630 --> 02:30:54,030
Skeletons.

4775
02:30:54,310 --> 02:30:54,710
Skeletons.

4776
02:30:54,710 --> 02:30:57,030
It really is because I don't know what to do right now.

4777
02:30:58,110 --> 02:30:59,630
I'm looking at Skeleton 1.

4778
02:30:59,870 --> 02:31:01,850
Some sort of altercation.

4779
02:31:02,370 --> 02:31:02,810
Okay.

4780
02:31:03,090 --> 02:31:04,410
Oh, there's the...

4781
02:31:08,650 --> 02:31:09,530
Internal memorandum.

4782
02:31:10,230 --> 02:31:10,670
What?

4783
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:14,070
You will ask to be kept informed of the radio situation.

4784
02:31:14,370 --> 02:31:17,110
We attempted outgoing messages at the following times with no response.

4785
02:31:17,730 --> 02:31:18,930
Oh my god, I'm going crazy.

4786
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:21,190
You found a secret, but I'm going crazy.

4787
02:31:21,650 --> 02:31:23,210
That's how it tends to be, isn't it?

4788
02:31:23,930 --> 02:31:28,010
I mean, Bradley's been pretty crazy this whole time, so like...

4789
02:31:29,250 --> 02:31:29,650
Oh!

4790
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:30,610
I found a wrench!

4791
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:31,650
Oh my god!

4792
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:32,370
Take that!

4793
02:31:32,470 --> 02:31:32,750
Take that!

4794
02:31:32,830 --> 02:31:33,170
Weapon!

4795
02:31:33,210 --> 02:31:33,410
Weapon!

4796
02:31:33,430 --> 02:31:33,670
Weapon!

4797
02:31:33,710 --> 02:31:34,470
Back to the ballroom.

4798
02:31:34,690 --> 02:31:35,190
Take that!

4799
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,710
Take that!

4800
02:31:35,890 --> 02:31:36,290
Yes!

4801
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:37,630
Oh, that's the wrench!

4802
02:31:37,710 --> 02:31:38,710
I found that wrench earlier!

4803
02:31:39,110 --> 02:31:40,290
Wait, next to the guy that was hanging?

4804
02:31:41,090 --> 02:31:41,330
Yeah!

4805
02:31:41,370 --> 02:31:41,670
Okay.

4806
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:42,250
Wait, what?

4807
02:31:43,350 --> 02:31:44,690
Next to the guy that hung himself?

4808
02:31:46,350 --> 02:31:48,950
There was no hung person when I was there.

4809
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,310
Are you sure?

4810
02:31:53,970 --> 02:31:54,810
Yeah, I'm...

4811
02:31:54,810 --> 02:31:55,930
I'm pretty sure.

4812
02:31:56,390 --> 02:31:57,830
Are you sure?

4813
02:32:01,010 --> 02:32:01,430
Yeah...

4814
02:32:01,430 --> 02:32:01,450
Yeah...

4815
02:32:03,450 --> 02:32:03,930
What's that?

4816
02:32:05,030 --> 02:32:07,590
Oh, the tiniest A button I've ever seen in my entire life.

4817
02:32:08,350 --> 02:32:09,890
Wait, what's going on?

4818
02:32:10,070 --> 02:32:10,570
Oh, there.

4819
02:32:10,770 --> 02:32:11,290
Press A.

4820
02:32:11,990 --> 02:32:16,090
Okay, I'm gonna head outside to the deck again and see if I can get out again.

4821
02:32:16,390 --> 02:32:16,890
Press A.

4822
02:32:17,050 --> 02:32:18,330
Oh, I think I'm trying the door.

4823
02:32:19,210 --> 02:32:20,230
I'm gonna go outside.

4824
02:32:21,390 --> 02:32:22,210
You're going outside?

4825
02:32:22,310 --> 02:32:23,970
Yeah, I'm going back outside.

4826
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:25,510
I can go outside again!

4827
02:32:26,210 --> 02:32:27,770
I still haven't seen...

4828
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:29,270
No.

4829
02:32:29,270 --> 02:32:30,410
No, I'm not hearing this.

4830
02:32:30,690 --> 02:32:31,250
I'm not hearing this.

4831
02:32:31,250 --> 02:32:31,530
I'm outside!

4832
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:33,230
The outside is real!

4833
02:32:33,410 --> 02:32:33,970
It's an old boat, Bradley.

4834
02:32:35,810 --> 02:32:37,430
It's an old boat, Bradley.

4835
02:32:37,930 --> 02:32:38,930
Chill out.

4836
02:32:40,430 --> 02:32:41,650
Okay, I'm going downstairs.

4837
02:32:41,950 --> 02:32:42,630
I got my wrench.

4838
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:48,250
When you go outside, it makes you go back inside.

4839
02:32:48,850 --> 02:32:50,450
Oh, so he'll PT, PT.

4840
02:32:51,370 --> 02:32:51,930
Yeah.

4841
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:53,590
Wait, I'm back here!

4842
02:32:55,150 --> 02:32:55,930
Here we go.

4843
02:32:57,050 --> 02:32:58,370
Oh, you cannot see the bottom.

4844
02:32:58,610 --> 02:32:59,130
Oh, boy.

4845
02:32:59,230 --> 02:32:59,630
Oh, boy.

4846
02:33:00,350 --> 02:33:01,410
Bradley, you're gonna die.

4847
02:33:01,550 --> 02:33:02,450
You're gonna die, Bradley!

4848
02:33:04,970 --> 02:33:05,890
What's going on?

4849
02:33:06,310 --> 02:33:08,150
Oh, I think I'm fine, actually.

4850
02:33:10,710 --> 02:33:12,250
Oh, you dropped the wrench!

4851
02:33:13,870 --> 02:33:15,370
No, don't drop the wrench!

4852
02:33:15,450 --> 02:33:16,570
We worked so hard for that!

4853
02:33:16,850 --> 02:33:18,370
What was the point of all of that?

4854
02:33:19,570 --> 02:33:20,450
Brad, is that you?

4855
02:33:20,450 --> 02:33:22,310
Oh, I'm seeing shadow people.

4856
02:33:22,450 --> 02:33:23,530
Uh-oh, I'm in trouble.

4857
02:33:23,690 --> 02:33:24,510
Brad, is that you?

4858
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:26,530
No, wait, is that... do you see me?

4859
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:27,070
Oh, no!

4860
02:33:27,290 --> 02:33:28,270
I missed the cutscene!

4861
02:33:28,470 --> 02:33:29,990
I can kill Brad right now!

4862
02:33:31,390 --> 02:33:32,510
Wait, no, don't!

4863
02:33:32,530 --> 02:33:32,890
That's me!

4864
02:33:33,170 --> 02:33:33,690
That's me!

4865
02:33:34,710 --> 02:33:35,270
That's me!

4866
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:37,610
I'm gonna kill you!

4867
02:33:38,790 --> 02:33:39,330
That's me!

4868
02:33:39,670 --> 02:33:40,530
You're as happy!

4869
02:33:40,670 --> 02:33:41,490
No, it's not you!

4870
02:33:41,970 --> 02:33:42,530
That's me!

4871
02:33:42,610 --> 02:33:43,130
Don't do it!

4872
02:33:43,210 --> 02:33:43,990
That's literally me!

4873
02:33:44,330 --> 02:33:45,010
Do not!

4874
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:45,870
Do not!

4875
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:48,750
Wait, there's multiple!

4876
02:33:48,750 --> 02:33:50,930
There's like five zombies here!

4877
02:33:51,730 --> 02:33:52,630
There's nothing!

4878
02:33:52,990 --> 02:33:54,590
Don't do anything!

4879
02:33:57,510 --> 02:34:00,490
I almost bashed your head in, I'm serious.

4880
02:34:01,990 --> 02:34:03,930
God damn it, Liz!

4881
02:34:05,710 --> 02:34:10,000
Who were you playing as, Fliss?

4882
02:34:10,300 --> 02:34:12,000
I think so.

4883
02:34:12,340 --> 02:34:16,180
Holy shit, you almost I almost killed you.

4884
02:34:17,020 --> 02:34:18,880
It's because you begged for it.

4885
02:34:18,940 --> 02:34:20,400
Oh my god, the guy is right behind us!

4886
02:34:20,500 --> 02:34:21,600
Oh shit!

4887
02:34:24,940 --> 02:34:26,820
You're like, Alfred, don't break my head!

4888
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,040
You're like, hmm...

4889
02:34:28,040 --> 02:34:29,740
Do I choose it?

4890
02:34:35,860 --> 02:34:37,860
Wait, are you Alex, right?

4891
02:34:38,700 --> 02:34:39,480
I think so.

4892
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:41,100
Wait, I got pulled out.

4893
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:42,120
What do you see in the water?

4894
02:34:43,660 --> 02:34:44,060
I'm...

4895
02:34:44,060 --> 02:34:45,600
I don't know, I got pulled out now.

4896
02:34:45,900 --> 02:34:46,720
Oh, I'm in the ship.

4897
02:34:46,740 --> 02:34:47,200
I thought baby.

4898
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:49,200
Or I'm in the plane, like before.

4899
02:34:51,820 --> 02:34:52,700
Oh, he's a...

4900
02:34:52,700 --> 02:34:53,820
Oh my god, it's out!

4901
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:54,620
There's a zombie!

4902
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:56,040
Oh!

4903
02:34:58,080 --> 02:34:59,280
Kill the zombie, kill the zombie.

4904
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:00,840
I punched him, I punched him.

4905
02:35:02,980 --> 02:35:04,360
I think Julia's gonna drown.

4906
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:06,180
Wait, you're Julia.

4907
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:07,000
Yeah, I know.

4908
02:35:10,700 --> 02:35:16,340
I did everything I was supposed to do.

4909
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:17,160
No, I'm fine.

4910
02:35:17,160 --> 02:35:17,900
Oh, hello.

4911
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:18,960
You seem really calm.

4912
02:35:19,140 --> 02:35:19,680
Oh, what the?

4913
02:35:19,780 --> 02:35:21,740
Okay, I have to help you now.

4914
02:35:22,140 --> 02:35:23,760
Wait, there's multiple of you!

4915
02:35:23,980 --> 02:35:24,860
What just happened?

4916
02:35:27,460 --> 02:35:28,940
Wait, what's going on?

4917
02:35:28,980 --> 02:35:29,760
It's all just black.

4918
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:31,380
I can't see anything.

4919
02:35:31,580 --> 02:35:34,740
I can't see anything!

4920
02:35:35,780 --> 02:35:37,320
Oh, this is a premonition!

4921
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:40,320
What's going on?

4922
02:35:40,560 --> 02:35:41,280
Who do I save?

4923
02:35:41,700 --> 02:35:43,280
Who do I save?

4924
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:45,120
Do I do it?

4925
02:35:45,140 --> 02:35:45,560
I'm heroic!

4926
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:48,100
I mean, who do you save?

4927
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:50,520
Wait, who's drowning?

4928
02:35:50,720 --> 02:35:51,500
Who's drowning?

4929
02:35:52,160 --> 02:35:52,880
Do it!

4930
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:53,840
Do it!

4931
02:35:53,940 --> 02:35:54,520
Keep going.

4932
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:58,000
Oh my god!

4933
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:00,640
Holy shit!

4934
02:36:02,480 --> 02:36:04,200
You made me kill a man!

4935
02:36:06,640 --> 02:36:08,240
Wait, was it you who died?

4936
02:36:09,060 --> 02:36:09,540
No!

4937
02:36:09,780 --> 02:36:16,210
You made me kill a man!

4938
02:36:16,970 --> 02:36:19,050
You were already working on it!

4939
02:36:20,230 --> 02:36:20,710
You were already working on it!

4940
02:36:20,710 --> 02:36:23,250
I was making sure he got fainted!

4941
02:36:23,390 --> 02:36:23,650
I was making sure he got fainted!

4942
02:36:23,650 --> 02:36:24,690
I had to kill him!

4943
02:36:26,710 --> 02:36:27,670
Do it!

4944
02:36:27,790 --> 02:36:28,590
Do it!

4945
02:36:28,790 --> 02:36:30,050
Do it!

4946
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:32,750
You were the one.

4947
02:36:32,770 --> 02:36:34,010
You could have let go at any time.

4948
02:36:34,110 --> 02:36:34,850
Okay, I'm just saying.

4949
02:36:35,290 --> 02:36:35,650
Okay,

4950
02:36:41,550 --> 02:36:43,770
I'm just saying.

4951
02:36:44,090 --> 02:36:45,030
Thanks, Min.

4952
02:36:45,110 --> 02:36:47,690
You made me kill a person.

4953
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:48,930
You could have stopped me!

4954
02:36:48,930 --> 02:36:49,990
I don't have any control!

4955
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:50,490
I'm sorry.

4956
02:36:51,230 --> 02:36:52,330
You did the right thing.

4957
02:36:52,410 --> 02:36:53,610
Yeah, you did the right thing.

4958
02:36:53,710 --> 02:36:54,210
It was him or us.

4959
02:36:54,310 --> 02:36:54,610
See?

4960
02:36:55,830 --> 02:36:56,350
What the?

4961
02:36:56,990 --> 02:36:57,950
What the fuck?

4962
02:37:00,990 --> 02:37:02,350
How did he get thrown over?

4963
02:37:02,390 --> 02:37:05,210
Oh my god!

4964
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:05,550
It's him!

4965
02:37:07,690 --> 02:37:08,410
What the?

4966
02:37:10,030 --> 02:37:10,830
What is going on?

4967
02:37:10,990 --> 02:37:11,310
What the?

4968
02:37:11,390 --> 02:37:12,130
Oh my god.

4969
02:37:12,550 --> 02:37:13,250
What's going on?

4970
02:37:14,090 --> 02:37:14,810
Punch him!

4971
02:37:15,290 --> 02:37:15,810
Punch him!

4972
02:37:15,810 --> 02:37:16,610
Do something!

4973
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:18,090
Oh my god.

4974
02:37:18,110 --> 02:37:18,230
Run!

4975
02:37:19,190 --> 02:37:20,470
Are we doing anything?

4976
02:37:21,090 --> 02:37:22,070
Quick time event.

4977
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:23,590
Maybe.

4978
02:37:23,830 --> 02:37:24,490
Who is he?

4979
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:26,930
That's the guy that had the hammer, right?

4980
02:37:27,270 --> 02:37:28,250
That's the hammer guy?

4981
02:37:28,490 --> 02:37:28,690
Yeah.

4982
02:37:28,770 --> 02:37:29,970
Why does he look pruney?

4983
02:37:30,470 --> 02:37:31,490
He was in the water.

4984
02:37:33,830 --> 02:37:34,910
It's John Medan.

4985
02:37:36,190 --> 02:37:37,590
Oh my god, it's Medan!

4986
02:37:37,590 --> 02:37:38,830
It's the man of Medan!

4987
02:37:39,990 --> 02:37:40,730
Oh my god.

4988
02:37:40,770 --> 02:37:41,310
Hey, stop.

4989
02:37:41,390 --> 02:37:42,450
Don't mess up your QTE.

4990
02:37:42,610 --> 02:37:43,730
You can't trip on the stairs.

4991
02:37:45,070 --> 02:37:45,510
Fuck.

4992
02:37:46,110 --> 02:37:46,670
Uh oh.

4993
02:37:46,770 --> 02:37:47,330
Come on, Julia.

4994
02:37:48,410 --> 02:37:48,950
Hit it.

4995
02:37:49,030 --> 02:37:49,330
He's here!

4996
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:52,070
What's the matter, dreamboat?

4997
02:37:52,870 --> 02:37:54,390
Don't show up to me anymore!

4998
02:37:54,970 --> 02:37:55,590
Uh oh.

4999
02:37:55,610 --> 02:37:55,910
Whoa!

5000
02:37:56,310 --> 02:37:57,010
Uh oh.

5001
02:37:58,630 --> 02:37:59,770
Time to use our fists.

5002
02:38:00,030 --> 02:38:00,250
We killed daddy!

5003
02:38:00,510 --> 02:38:02,950
Oh my god!

5004
02:38:02,950 --> 02:38:03,830
Oh my god, you did it!

5005
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:05,610
Oh my god, I'm so proud of you!

5006
02:38:09,970 --> 02:38:10,850
Holy shit!

5007
02:38:11,010 --> 02:38:13,290
Those are the most quick time events I've ever...

5008
02:38:15,810 --> 02:38:16,690
I'm actually proud of you.

5009
02:38:16,690 --> 02:38:17,410
Wait, which way do we go?

5010
02:38:17,730 --> 02:38:18,490
I don't know.

5011
02:38:18,750 --> 02:38:20,330
Are you this side or am I this side?

5012
02:38:20,330 --> 02:38:20,790
I don't know!

5013
02:38:24,150 --> 02:38:24,550
Jump!

5014
02:38:24,770 --> 02:38:25,170
Jump!

5015
02:38:25,170 --> 02:38:25,550
Jump!

5016
02:38:25,550 --> 02:38:25,770
Jump!

5017
02:38:25,770 --> 02:38:25,930
Jump!

5018
02:38:25,930 --> 02:38:26,170
Jump!

5019
02:38:26,170 --> 02:38:26,450
Jump!

5020
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:26,630
Jump!

5021
02:38:27,030 --> 02:38:27,430
Shit.

5022
02:38:28,750 --> 02:38:29,270
Let's jump.

5023
02:38:31,150 --> 02:38:31,950
My bad.

5024
02:38:32,070 --> 02:38:32,370
It's okay.

5025
02:38:32,830 --> 02:38:33,230
Okay.

5026
02:38:34,850 --> 02:38:36,290
Just to help me up, you know?

5027
02:38:36,450 --> 02:38:39,090
Maybe we shouldn't have jumped.

5028
02:38:41,150 --> 02:38:42,970
I pressed Y, but I also pressed...

5029
02:38:42,970 --> 02:38:43,530
Keep going!

5030
02:38:43,610 --> 02:38:43,830
Keep going!

5031
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:44,510
Keep going!

5032
02:38:44,670 --> 02:38:45,550
Keep going!

5033
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:46,930
Oh, okay.

5034
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:49,470
That's fine.

5035
02:38:50,370 --> 02:38:51,870
You're gonna kill a second man.

5036
02:38:51,990 --> 02:38:52,870
You're obsessed with it.

5037
02:38:53,530 --> 02:38:54,650
Oh my god!

5038
02:39:04,600 --> 02:39:06,160
Oh my god, keep going.

5039
02:39:06,380 --> 02:39:06,900
Oh, we're outside.

5040
02:39:08,420 --> 02:39:09,160
Oh my god!

5041
02:39:09,320 --> 02:39:10,040
Oh my god!

5042
02:39:14,020 --> 02:39:15,200
You're killing him!

5043
02:39:17,580 --> 02:39:18,540
I'm bloodthirsty!

5044
02:39:19,460 --> 02:39:20,800
Oh, this is the...

5045
02:39:20,820 --> 02:39:21,420
Premonition!

5046
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:22,940
Yeah, you saved him!

5047
02:39:24,460 --> 02:39:25,800
Oh my god, it's Fliss.

5048
02:39:26,940 --> 02:39:27,940
Yeah, it's me.

5049
02:39:28,040 --> 02:39:28,600
Come on, let's go.

5050
02:39:28,840 --> 02:39:29,620
Where's Bradley?

5051
02:39:29,980 --> 02:39:30,900
Oh my god!

5052
02:39:32,440 --> 02:39:33,040
Everybody's alive!

5053
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:34,280
Oh my gosh, we're doing it.

5054
02:39:34,300 --> 02:39:34,760
We're doing it.

5055
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:35,240
We're doing it.

5056
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:36,020
We're doing it.

5057
02:39:36,020 --> 02:39:36,540
We're doing it.

5058
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:39,180
We're supposed to kill people, but somehow it's working.

5059
02:39:42,540 --> 02:39:44,180
Wait, how is Bradley alive?

5060
02:39:45,820 --> 02:39:47,740
We're too good at the game, I think.

5061
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:49,140
We're so good.

5062
02:39:52,760 --> 02:39:53,660
Oh my god.

5063
02:39:53,780 --> 02:39:54,020
Oh my god.

5064
02:39:54,020 --> 02:39:54,800
Keep going, keep going.

5065
02:39:56,900 --> 02:39:57,860
Murder works?

5066
02:40:03,220 --> 02:40:04,180
I think...

5067
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:06,600
Yeah, I think we'll be alright here.

5068
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:07,600
Okay.

5069
02:40:08,160 --> 02:40:08,640
Okay.

5070
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:11,020
What?

5071
02:40:11,160 --> 02:40:12,000
Why do you think that?

5072
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:13,160
I don't trust you, Bradley.

5073
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:16,720
Bradley, you almost killed Fliss!

5074
02:40:16,900 --> 02:40:17,660
Oh, hello.

5075
02:40:17,660 --> 02:40:20,760
I think he's just as surprised that everybody's alive.

5076
02:40:20,920 --> 02:40:21,000
I think he's just as surprised that everybody's alive.

5077
02:40:23,480 --> 02:40:24,380
Wouldn't you say?

5078
02:40:24,480 --> 02:40:25,680
Yeah, it's kind of crazy.

5079
02:40:27,060 --> 02:40:29,260
I didn't see so many dead people.

5080
02:40:29,560 --> 02:40:30,640
I'm kind of disappointed in that.

5081
02:40:31,700 --> 02:40:33,240
Why don't we meet?

5082
02:40:33,540 --> 02:40:34,940
You hadn't saw them come alive.

5083
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:36,400
Apparently.

5084
02:40:36,900 --> 02:40:38,560
Have you figured out what's going on?

5085
02:40:38,760 --> 02:40:39,940
How to stop it?

5086
02:40:40,040 --> 02:40:43,680
How to save the lives of your poor unfortunate stowaway?

5087
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:44,400
No, we just gotta leave.

5088
02:40:44,400 --> 02:40:45,840
Yeah, just leave!

5089
02:40:46,280 --> 02:40:46,860
I hope.

5090
02:40:47,740 --> 02:40:51,320
Although it seems the ship's previous occupants never managed to.

5091
02:40:52,540 --> 02:40:54,860
Quite a lot of deaths that night.

5092
02:40:55,220 --> 02:40:56,500
The whole ship died, right?

5093
02:40:57,360 --> 02:40:58,520
Let me help you out.

5094
02:40:58,900 --> 02:41:01,180
Oh boy, another hint.

5095
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,040
Yeah, I would do two.

5096
02:41:03,760 --> 02:41:04,920
Yeah, I need some help.

5097
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,060
Give me a hint, man.

5098
02:41:06,740 --> 02:41:08,000
I don't want spoilers.

5099
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:08,140
Really?

5100
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:15,140
Well then, how can I put this?

5101
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:20,000
There may be forces at play here that are more scientific.

5102
02:41:20,340 --> 02:41:21,100
Scientific?

5103
02:41:21,160 --> 02:41:24,040
Even some that are more political.

5104
02:41:24,080 --> 02:41:24,740
You know?

5105
02:41:24,840 --> 02:41:26,980
Less supernatural.

5106
02:41:27,720 --> 02:41:28,240
What?

5107
02:41:29,680 --> 02:41:32,600
Perhaps you've started to realize something.

5108
02:41:33,780 --> 02:41:35,020
Spatial expression?

5109
02:41:35,160 --> 02:41:40,780
Everything and everyone may not be quite what they appear to be.

5110
02:41:41,640 --> 02:41:42,680
What the fuck does that mean?

5111
02:41:42,860 --> 02:41:44,620
I hope that helps.

5112
02:41:45,640 --> 02:41:46,680
What does that mean?

5113
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:54,180
Well, aren't you excited to find out what your poor unfortunates are making of all this and how you might avoid any more unnecessary Is it the gas?

5114
02:41:54,540 --> 02:41:55,480
Yeah, it's all gas.

5115
02:41:55,860 --> 02:41:57,380
It's not supernatural.

5116
02:41:58,700 --> 02:41:59,640
It's not curses.

5117
02:41:59,740 --> 02:42:01,580
We're hallucinating because of the gases.

5118
02:42:01,960 --> 02:42:07,080
The more we're inside, the more we're getting hallucinations.

5119
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:08,560
Gas, gas.

5120
02:42:08,920 --> 02:42:10,580
I don't think we should go back inside.

5121
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:11,740
Alright.

5122
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,560
What the hell was wrong with you back there?

5123
02:42:16,420 --> 02:42:17,780
I don't know, Mitt.

5124
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:19,180
You almost bashed my head.

5125
02:42:19,820 --> 02:42:20,600
Come on.

5126
02:42:21,480 --> 02:42:22,280
That's ridiculous.

5127
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:25,220
What the fuck is going on with this ship?

5128
02:42:25,460 --> 02:42:26,440
We're seeing dead people.

5129
02:42:26,720 --> 02:42:31,920
It feels like there's some evil, like literal evil going on down there.

5130
02:42:32,360 --> 02:42:35,380
Let's just stay calm and relatively sane about this.

5131
02:42:35,540 --> 02:42:35,920
Okay?

5132
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:38,160
I saw.

5133
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:40,480
It's like there were these old soldiers.

5134
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:41,460
They were bodies.

5135
02:42:41,620 --> 02:42:42,100
They were dead.

5136
02:42:42,220 --> 02:42:44,000
But then they came alive and...

5137
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:47,880
That doesn't sound that crazy right about now.

5138
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:49,920
Alex wasn't the only Alex.

5139
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:50,460
Oh.

5140
02:42:50,640 --> 02:42:52,840
Alex wasn't the only Alex.

5141
02:42:53,700 --> 02:42:55,600
That's why I was confused.

5142
02:42:56,920 --> 02:42:57,920
It was horrifying.

5143
02:42:58,260 --> 02:43:00,360
What do you mean Alex wasn't the only Alex?

5144
02:43:01,600 --> 02:43:03,480
I wouldn't hurt you.

5145
02:43:04,600 --> 02:43:05,720
I'd never hurt you.

5146
02:43:06,420 --> 02:43:07,400
You know that, right?

5147
02:43:08,000 --> 02:43:08,580
True, I know.

5148
02:43:08,620 --> 02:43:10,920
This can't all be happening.

5149
02:43:11,680 --> 02:43:13,100
Our relationship went up.

5150
02:43:13,160 --> 02:43:13,820
We're fixing it.

5151
02:43:13,860 --> 02:43:16,640
We're fixing your mess.

5152
02:43:17,520 --> 02:43:18,760
No, your mess.

5153
02:43:18,940 --> 02:43:20,120
Their prior mess.

5154
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:21,300
They had a mess already.

5155
02:43:22,140 --> 02:43:23,900
We're just making it better.

5156
02:43:24,680 --> 02:43:25,760
What do we know that's real?

5157
02:43:26,820 --> 02:43:27,280
Um...

5158
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:30,340
Is this a ghost ship?

5159
02:43:30,920 --> 02:43:33,160
Am I crazy or are we on a ghost ship?

5160
02:43:33,300 --> 02:43:38,200
Ghost ships are real and this is one and we're totally on it and holy shit we're so totally fucked.

5161
02:43:39,360 --> 02:43:40,880
I was gonna say the same thing.

5162
02:43:41,160 --> 02:43:42,400
Yeah, I'm not crazy.

5163
02:43:42,400 --> 02:43:44,400
I'm one of the first people to see weird shit here.

5164
02:43:44,520 --> 02:43:48,740
Apparently the guards were super freaked out by something they saw in the cargo holds.

5165
02:43:48,940 --> 02:43:49,140
Oooh.

5166
02:43:50,620 --> 02:43:51,860
Ghost ship real.

5167
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:54,300
Because they were really freaked out by something.

5168
02:43:54,680 --> 02:43:54,880
Yeah.

5169
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:59,680
Oh, there might be bacteria on the gold that's eating our brains.

5170
02:44:00,140 --> 02:44:01,560
It's a brain-eating bacteria.

5171
02:44:02,220 --> 02:44:04,080
Anyone figure out what happened to all the sailors?

5172
02:44:04,580 --> 02:44:06,580
Did they catch a rescue boat or something?

5173
02:44:06,700 --> 02:44:08,120
I mean, we've seen their bodies.

5174
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:10,180
It all feels more like a mausoleum than a ship.

5175
02:44:10,380 --> 02:44:11,780
So where did all the corpses come from?

5176
02:44:12,280 --> 02:44:14,840
They actually look like they've been scared to death.

5177
02:44:16,020 --> 02:44:16,700
Heart attack.

5178
02:44:17,060 --> 02:44:17,760
Heart attack, yeah.

5179
02:44:17,860 --> 02:44:19,360
I'm not gonna ask about the gold.

5180
02:44:19,560 --> 02:44:21,780
It keeps being like, ask about the gold.

5181
02:44:21,840 --> 02:44:23,400
I'm not gonna ask about the gold.

5182
02:44:23,480 --> 02:44:23,900
Why not?

5183
02:44:24,240 --> 02:44:24,600
Why not?

5184
02:44:25,240 --> 02:44:26,540
It's a cursed gold.

5185
02:44:26,940 --> 02:44:29,740
Our kid was like, don't be greedy.

5186
02:44:30,340 --> 02:44:30,640
No.

5187
02:44:31,580 --> 02:44:33,120
Oh, I'll ask about the gold.

5188
02:44:33,160 --> 02:44:33,980
Don't worry, I got you.

5189
02:44:34,280 --> 02:44:35,860
That gold should be around here, right?

5190
02:44:36,680 --> 02:44:37,900
Anybody catch a glimpse of it?

5191
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:40,440
It's actually gold.

5192
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:43,840
It's looking all over our gold.

5193
02:44:44,620 --> 02:44:45,020
Yeah.

5194
02:44:45,320 --> 02:44:48,160
I'm pretty sure this isn't exactly what our I got you, I got you.

5195
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:48,620
Don't worry.

5196
02:44:50,440 --> 02:44:51,660
This should go over well.

5197
02:44:51,860 --> 02:44:53,260
We know more than we did before.

5198
02:44:53,480 --> 02:44:53,660
That's supposed to be greedy.

5199
02:44:54,940 --> 02:44:56,060
I'm just wondering.

5200
02:44:57,780 --> 02:44:59,700
What's wrong with being curious?

5201
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:00,540
Time to get off this ship.

5202
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:03,400
We're not going anywhere without the distributor cap.

5203
02:45:03,620 --> 02:45:04,920
The Duke needs it to run.

5204
02:45:05,100 --> 02:45:06,220
Didn't you grab that though?

5205
02:45:06,260 --> 02:45:06,960
She grabbed it.

5206
02:45:07,140 --> 02:45:09,020
No, one of the captains grabbed it.

5207
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:12,040
If we can find it and use it.

5208
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:12,780
Oh, it's working.

5209
02:45:13,220 --> 02:45:15,120
That's great, but do you think it still works?

5210
02:45:15,740 --> 02:45:16,780
Yeah, but where's the radio?

5211
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:18,140
It was blinking, see?

5212
02:45:18,940 --> 02:45:21,280
I know that means the radio's on, but where's the radio station?

5213
02:45:21,720 --> 02:45:22,660
Probably over there, right?

5214
02:45:22,740 --> 02:45:22,920
Yeah.

5215
02:45:23,700 --> 02:45:24,900
Oh, what the fuck?

5216
02:45:25,720 --> 02:45:26,520
Oh, okay.

5217
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:27,660
Wait, who am I?

5218
02:45:27,680 --> 02:45:28,300
Oh, I'm Fliss.

5219
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:28,640
I'm Fliss.

5220
02:45:28,640 --> 02:45:29,640
Okay, I'm Alex.

5221
02:45:29,760 --> 02:45:30,640
Okay, before we start...

5222
02:45:30,640 --> 02:45:31,380
Wait, I need to pause.

5223
02:45:31,560 --> 02:45:32,160
I need the bathroom.

5224
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:32,680
Okay.

5225
02:45:32,860 --> 02:45:33,620
I'll be right back.

5226
02:45:35,060 --> 02:45:37,420
Let's look at the collections and characters, everybody.

5227
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,220
Let's look at the collections and characters, everybody.

5228
02:45:38,220 --> 02:45:39,240
I'm Fliss.

5229
02:45:39,300 --> 02:45:40,100
I'm innocent.

5230
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:41,560
I'm relaxed.

5231
02:45:42,100 --> 02:45:44,040
Oh, all of our...

5232
02:45:44,040 --> 02:45:46,580
Oh my god, my relationship with Alex is insane.

5233
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:49,500
I just watched it go all the way down.

5234
02:45:50,560 --> 02:45:51,860
Brad is whatever.

5235
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:53,360
Julia's pretty down.

5236
02:45:54,640 --> 02:45:55,900
Conrad, but I'm innocent.

5237
02:45:56,040 --> 02:45:56,620
I'm relaxed.

5238
02:45:56,620 --> 02:45:57,120
I'm excited.

5239
02:45:57,320 --> 02:45:57,960
I'm altruistic.

5240
02:45:58,060 --> 02:45:58,700
I'm guarded.

5241
02:45:58,900 --> 02:45:59,720
I'm motivated.

5242
02:46:00,200 --> 02:46:01,080
Oh my god.

5243
02:46:01,400 --> 02:46:01,940
What secrets?

5244
02:46:02,220 --> 02:46:02,400
Wow.

5245
02:46:02,820 --> 02:46:05,240
Oh, actually we haven't even found that many, have we?

5246
02:46:06,100 --> 02:46:06,720
What's this?

5247
02:46:07,720 --> 02:46:08,560
Flight plan.

5248
02:46:10,180 --> 02:46:10,900
Uh-huh.

5249
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,720
Private Miller.

5250
02:46:11,860 --> 02:46:12,400
Master Miller.

5251
02:46:13,060 --> 02:46:14,060
Our bearings.

5252
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:15,480
What are these?

5253
02:46:15,640 --> 02:46:16,700
The kitchen knife.

5254
02:46:17,480 --> 02:46:20,080
Oh, these are the hints that we've gotten, I think.

5255
02:46:20,360 --> 02:46:21,540
Yeah, these are the hints.

5256
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:24,100
Our premonitions.

5257
02:46:26,620 --> 02:46:27,620
Cut of your jib.

5258
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:30,300
In the offing.

5259
02:46:32,020 --> 02:46:33,500
High and dry.

5260
02:46:35,020 --> 02:46:35,900
Master Miller.

5261
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:37,040
Yeah, Master Miller.

5262
02:46:38,320 --> 02:46:38,880
Let's see.

5263
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:46,940
Oh gosh, I'm so used to playing Japanese games where there's circles to press okay.

5264
02:46:47,220 --> 02:46:47,800
Oh my gosh.

5265
02:46:48,260 --> 02:46:49,280
Ryan Carter.

5266
02:46:49,960 --> 02:46:50,480
I'm back.

5267
02:46:50,820 --> 02:46:51,400
Oh, welcome back.

5268
02:46:51,900 --> 02:46:53,740
What were you doing?

5269
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:55,700
I was looking at our secrets.

5270
02:46:56,620 --> 02:46:58,120
Yeah, did we get some good secrets?

5271
02:46:58,480 --> 02:46:58,780
Oh yeah.

5272
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:03,340
I'm surprised we're making it this far.

5273
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:05,680
Alright, I'm ready.

5274
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:06,180
Honestly.

5275
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:09,400
Okay.

5276
02:47:09,400 --> 02:47:10,640
Anything else in here?

5277
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:11,920
I don't think so.

5278
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:12,800
I think we're supposed to go outside.

5279
02:47:13,700 --> 02:47:16,340
The longer we stay inside, the more we inhale the gas.

5280
02:47:16,740 --> 02:47:17,120
You're right.

5281
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:17,780
But we're outside.

5282
02:47:17,960 --> 02:47:18,480
It's fine.

5283
02:47:19,360 --> 02:47:21,420
Yeah, that's why we gotta stay outside now.

5284
02:47:21,540 --> 02:47:22,220
Totally effed.

5285
02:47:22,260 --> 02:47:23,220
Totally effed.

5286
02:47:23,820 --> 02:47:25,640
Oh my god, we're so effed right now.

5287
02:47:25,720 --> 02:47:26,300
I'm just going for it.

5288
02:47:26,620 --> 02:47:28,300
Are you playing as Fliss and not my girlfriend?

5289
02:47:29,140 --> 02:47:29,620
Julia.

5290
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:30,800
Yeah, I don't know.

5291
02:47:31,300 --> 02:47:31,780
Yeah.

5292
02:47:33,240 --> 02:47:34,920
I looked at our relationship.

5293
02:47:35,180 --> 02:47:37,680
Fliss' relationship with Alex is completely down.

5294
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:38,660
What?

5295
02:47:39,860 --> 02:47:40,920
What did you do?

5296
02:47:41,940 --> 02:47:43,180
What do you mean what did I?

5297
02:47:43,420 --> 02:47:46,360
You literally go like, Fliss go down there.

5298
02:47:46,500 --> 02:47:48,800
I've never been Fliss.

5299
02:47:48,880 --> 02:47:50,440
I've been Fliss like...

5300
02:47:50,440 --> 02:47:51,420
Fliss go down there.

5301
02:47:51,540 --> 02:47:52,020
What's this?

5302
02:47:53,340 --> 02:47:54,880
I'm gonna look at it.

5303
02:47:54,880 --> 02:47:55,540
I'm looking at it.

5304
02:47:55,540 --> 02:47:56,060
I'm looking at it.

5305
02:47:56,140 --> 02:47:56,600
I'm looking at it.

5306
02:47:56,620 --> 02:47:57,460
I'm looking at it too.

5307
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,280
I'm looking at it.

5308
02:47:58,960 --> 02:47:59,320
Holes.

5309
02:47:59,360 --> 02:47:59,800
Bullet holes.

5310
02:48:00,080 --> 02:48:01,440
Oh, there's bullet holes there.

5311
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:03,240
We can't use them.

5312
02:48:03,420 --> 02:48:04,220
We can't use them.

5313
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:05,440
We can't use them.

5314
02:48:05,460 --> 02:48:06,060
We gotta go forward.

5315
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:08,500
Oh yeah, he did accuse her of being in cahoots.

5316
02:48:08,500 --> 02:48:08,960
That's true.

5317
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:11,540
Yeah, didn't you accuse me?

5318
02:48:11,780 --> 02:48:12,480
No, I didn't do that.

5319
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:13,120
It was Alex.

5320
02:48:13,320 --> 02:48:14,100
It was Alex.

5321
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:15,740
It was Alex.

5322
02:48:18,080 --> 02:48:19,580
Oh, we're finding a way up?

5323
02:48:19,700 --> 02:48:20,280
Is that what we're doing?

5324
02:48:20,720 --> 02:48:22,480
We have to find a way to get to the radio tower.

5325
02:48:22,860 --> 02:48:23,900
Oh, I thought...

5326
02:48:23,900 --> 02:48:25,560
Okay, I thought we had to just get over there.

5327
02:48:26,280 --> 02:48:30,360
Oh my gosh, we're acting really casual for like, you know, some guys that are...

5328
02:48:30,360 --> 02:48:31,040
We're like, you know...

5329
02:48:31,040 --> 02:48:34,520
for almost... for seeing several dead people.

5330
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:36,060
And I killed a man.

5331
02:48:36,240 --> 02:48:37,260
I killed several men.

5332
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:38,140
I found a way up!

5333
02:48:38,140 --> 02:48:38,600
Over here!

5334
02:48:38,760 --> 02:48:39,240
Help me out!

5335
02:48:42,480 --> 02:48:44,080
I think this is our way up.

5336
02:48:44,580 --> 02:48:45,960
I mean, it's the only way up.

5337
02:48:45,980 --> 02:48:46,340
Give me a lift.

5338
02:48:47,280 --> 02:48:47,680
What?

5339
02:48:47,800 --> 02:48:48,820
Give you a lift?

5340
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:51,800
Yeah, you're a strong, powerful woman.

5341
02:48:51,800 --> 02:48:52,740
Oh my god!

5342
02:48:53,280 --> 02:48:53,640
Damn!

5343
02:48:55,220 --> 02:48:56,680
Shouldn't it be me?

5344
02:48:57,820 --> 02:48:58,300
Right!

5345
02:48:59,080 --> 02:48:59,920
Holy shit!

5346
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:03,200
And he doesn't even help her get all the way up.

5347
02:49:03,380 --> 02:49:05,720
Yeah, he just pulls you a little bit.

5348
02:49:05,800 --> 02:49:06,540
I was like, alright.

5349
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:08,140
I did my job.

5350
02:49:09,320 --> 02:49:10,280
I'm a gentleman.

5351
02:49:11,480 --> 02:49:12,700
Dang, she's strong.

5352
02:49:13,320 --> 02:49:14,240
Oh, we're back.

5353
02:49:14,680 --> 02:49:15,400
Oh, we're back.

5354
02:49:15,520 --> 02:49:16,280
Did no one help Brad?

5355
02:49:16,540 --> 02:49:17,260
Nope, there he is.

5356
02:49:17,260 --> 02:49:17,900
He's standing right there.

5357
02:49:18,240 --> 02:49:18,960
I know, I know.

5358
02:49:19,020 --> 02:49:20,580
But no one helped him get up.

5359
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:22,840
Brad, are you okay?

5360
02:49:23,040 --> 02:49:24,160
Wait, I'm gonna go talk to him.

5361
02:49:24,860 --> 02:49:26,700
You're gonna talk to him?

5362
02:49:26,900 --> 02:49:28,420
Bro, we gotta find the radio tower!

5363
02:49:28,660 --> 02:49:30,480
What are you thinking, Brad?

5364
02:49:30,520 --> 02:49:32,560
The longer we're here, the more we're inhaling the gas.

5365
02:49:33,140 --> 02:49:34,040
He doesn't care!

5366
02:49:34,420 --> 02:49:36,080
He really doesn't care about me.

5367
02:49:36,280 --> 02:49:37,780
He doesn't care about you.

5368
02:49:37,940 --> 02:49:39,720
You literally almost bashed your head.

5369
02:49:40,380 --> 02:49:42,100
Well, he almost bashed my head.

5370
02:49:42,180 --> 02:49:44,440
If anything, I shouldn't be wanting to talk to him.

5371
02:49:45,700 --> 02:49:47,300
Okay, we gotta split up, maybe.

5372
02:49:47,720 --> 02:49:48,980
No, we're not splitting up.

5373
02:49:48,980 --> 02:49:49,760
Who's that down there?

5374
02:49:50,020 --> 02:49:50,340
Who's that?

5375
02:49:51,900 --> 02:49:52,760
There's someone down there.

5376
02:49:52,840 --> 02:49:53,460
No, but that's Brad.

5377
02:49:53,820 --> 02:49:54,520
No, no, no.

5378
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:55,080
Over here.

5379
02:49:55,940 --> 02:49:56,700
Wait, there is.

5380
02:49:56,900 --> 02:49:57,460
You're right.

5381
02:49:57,600 --> 02:49:58,000
Who's that?

5382
02:49:58,380 --> 02:49:59,280
I'm going the other way.

5383
02:49:59,680 --> 02:50:00,080
See?

5384
02:50:01,020 --> 02:50:02,420
I told you this way was the better way.

5385
02:50:03,280 --> 02:50:04,180
I told you.

5386
02:50:04,280 --> 02:50:04,660
I told you.

5387
02:50:04,960 --> 02:50:05,360
Oh.

5388
02:50:07,740 --> 02:50:08,540
Ladies first.

5389
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:11,060
You have the flashlight.

5390
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:12,560
Ladies first.

5391
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:13,940
I'm a gentleman.

5392
02:50:14,480 --> 02:50:15,280
I'll go here.

5393
02:50:16,760 --> 02:50:17,820
No, I can't see.

5394
02:50:18,120 --> 02:50:19,240
It's so dark.

5395
02:50:19,980 --> 02:50:20,460
Madame.

5396
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:22,860
It's so dark.

5397
02:50:23,280 --> 02:50:23,820
I can't see.

5398
02:50:23,980 --> 02:50:26,800
I'm holding the flashlight in front of you now.

5399
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:27,480
No.

5400
02:50:29,080 --> 02:50:30,460
It's on the wall.

5401
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:32,940
Oh my god.

5402
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,060
What is going on here?

5403
02:50:34,780 --> 02:50:36,740
I don't like that camera angle.

5404
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:38,380
I can't see what's in front of us.

5405
02:50:39,460 --> 02:50:40,200
Oh my god.

5406
02:50:41,020 --> 02:50:41,800
Oh, it's gone.

5407
02:50:42,260 --> 02:50:42,900
It's gone?

5408
02:50:45,720 --> 02:50:47,040
Oh, it's Julia.

5409
02:50:50,960 --> 02:50:51,840
Oh my god.

5410
02:50:52,260 --> 02:50:53,060
It's Julia.

5411
02:50:59,440 --> 02:51:01,680
Why were you so afraid of your own girlfriend?

5412
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:02,540
Over here.

5413
02:51:02,760 --> 02:51:04,540
No, I just wanted you to go first.

5414
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:06,420
Because I'm ladies first, you know?

5415
02:51:06,500 --> 02:51:06,840
Oh, okay.

5416
02:51:07,320 --> 02:51:10,520
Yeah, yeah.

5417
02:51:13,540 --> 02:51:14,100
Come on.

5418
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:15,220
Yeah, I guess I'll do it myself.

5419
02:51:15,460 --> 02:51:16,180
Yeah, do it yourself.

5420
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:20,420
Why were you screaming at my girlfriend?

5421
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:22,120
I mean, it's Julia.

5422
02:51:24,060 --> 02:51:26,120
I thought we wanted to keep Julia alive.

5423
02:51:26,580 --> 02:51:28,260
Yeah, but I still don't like her.

5424
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,300
Oh my god.

5425
02:51:29,360 --> 02:51:30,540
Okay, we're trapped in there.

5426
02:51:30,740 --> 02:51:32,560
Okay, we're trapped in the toxic gas again.

5427
02:51:32,840 --> 02:51:34,760
Yeah, great thinking, Alex.

5428
02:51:34,920 --> 02:51:35,520
Good job.

5429
02:51:35,560 --> 02:51:36,340
Oh, there's a guy in here.

5430
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:36,900
There's a dead body.

5431
02:51:38,040 --> 02:51:39,720
Oh, this has to be the radio tower, right?

5432
02:51:39,900 --> 02:51:41,720
No, this is the captain's room, right?

5433
02:51:41,760 --> 02:51:43,480
Oh, this is the captain's room.

5434
02:51:43,480 --> 02:51:44,280
There's Brad.

5435
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:46,320
I'm looking for...

5436
02:51:46,780 --> 02:51:47,220
Premonition!

5437
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:50,780
We need to know the premonition.

5438
02:51:51,700 --> 02:51:52,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5439
02:51:53,220 --> 02:51:54,160
Oh my god!

5440
02:51:55,400 --> 02:51:56,100
What is it?

5441
02:51:56,320 --> 02:51:57,780
It was one of the bad guys.

5442
02:51:57,860 --> 02:51:58,760
He just shoots himself.

5443
02:51:59,380 --> 02:52:00,100
Oh, what?

5444
02:52:00,320 --> 02:52:02,380
We have to convince him to shoot himself then.

5445
02:52:03,780 --> 02:52:04,980
I'm taking in these gases.

5446
02:52:06,380 --> 02:52:07,540
There's a door to our right.

5447
02:52:08,120 --> 02:52:09,440
Yeah, there's a door over here.

5448
02:52:10,440 --> 02:52:11,420
Bradley, are you okay?

5449
02:52:11,420 --> 02:52:12,420
Why are you like...

5450
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:14,780
I don't think Bradley's okay.

5451
02:52:15,020 --> 02:52:17,980
I feel like at any point I'm gonna walk over and they're gonna be T-posing.

5452
02:52:19,240 --> 02:52:20,160
Oh, the door doesn't work.

5453
02:52:20,180 --> 02:52:20,720
Can you open that door?

5454
02:52:20,920 --> 02:52:21,500
No, okay.

5455
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:23,060
I guess we'll go this way then.

5456
02:52:23,640 --> 02:52:24,040
Alright.

5457
02:52:26,160 --> 02:52:26,800
Here we go.

5458
02:52:27,480 --> 02:52:29,360
Oh my god, Julia, please!

5459
02:52:30,180 --> 02:52:31,880
Julia, what the f...

5460
02:52:31,880 --> 02:52:32,500
Why are you so chill?

5461
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:35,140
Why are you just standing there like that?

5462
02:52:35,200 --> 02:52:35,460
I know!

5463
02:52:35,580 --> 02:52:36,460
She's chill like that.

5464
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:37,980
She's so chill.

5465
02:52:38,260 --> 02:52:39,120
Is that another premonition?

5466
02:52:41,420 --> 02:52:43,520
They went from California...

5467
02:52:43,980 --> 02:52:44,420
Oh.

5468
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:47,260
They went to the United States and then...

5469
02:52:47,260 --> 02:52:47,760
Korea?

5470
02:52:48,400 --> 02:52:48,840
Whoa.

5471
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:53,300
It's almost like they didn't want anyone to know they were coming.

5472
02:52:53,740 --> 02:52:54,960
This is such a messed up...

5473
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:55,880
That is a long route.

5474
02:52:56,500 --> 02:52:58,100
Why'd they go all the way down there?

5475
02:52:59,200 --> 02:52:59,640
Yeah.

5476
02:52:59,640 --> 02:53:00,840
There's no islands there.

5477
02:53:01,200 --> 02:53:02,540
Oh, I got a secret.

5478
02:53:03,820 --> 02:53:05,040
We got a secret.

5479
02:53:06,200 --> 02:53:07,160
I found a note.

5480
02:53:07,780 --> 02:53:08,880
Oh, I see you.

5481
02:53:08,940 --> 02:53:09,480
I'm watching you.

5482
02:53:09,560 --> 02:53:10,040
Pick it up.

5483
02:53:11,420 --> 02:53:11,760
Let's see.

5484
02:53:11,920 --> 02:53:14,640
The United States Department of the Navy.

5485
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:16,180
The ship was blown off course.

5486
02:53:16,320 --> 02:53:17,820
The cloud cover was bad.

5487
02:53:18,620 --> 02:53:20,020
They couldn't establish a position.

5488
02:53:21,200 --> 02:53:22,780
Oh, there was a storm.

5489
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:25,180
Well, and somebody went overboard.

5490
02:53:25,560 --> 02:53:27,200
Oh, someone failed their quick time events.

5491
02:53:27,320 --> 02:53:28,280
That could have been you, Mint.

5492
02:53:28,420 --> 02:53:30,140
That could have been me, but it wasn't.

5493
02:53:30,160 --> 02:53:31,020
Oh, there's a dead guy here.

5494
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:32,740
The radio!

5495
02:53:32,880 --> 02:53:36,120
I found it.

5496
02:53:37,640 --> 02:53:39,120
There's only one way.

5497
02:53:40,380 --> 02:53:41,760
No freaking way.

5498
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:42,460
I found it, Mint.

5499
02:53:42,560 --> 02:53:44,100
This thing actually still works?

5500
02:53:44,160 --> 02:53:44,740
Yeah, I found it.

5501
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,820
Alright, there goes nothing.

5502
02:53:47,540 --> 02:53:49,560
Alright, let's see if you know how to do it.

5503
02:53:49,800 --> 02:53:50,760
You found it!

5504
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:51,540
You found it!

5505
02:53:51,860 --> 02:53:55,020
Good old shortwave radio.

5506
02:53:57,280 --> 02:53:58,460
What am I listening for?

5507
02:53:58,780 --> 02:53:59,480
Oh, fuck.

5508
02:53:59,740 --> 02:54:00,740
It's a number station.

5509
02:54:01,480 --> 02:54:02,260
Number station?

5510
02:54:04,580 --> 02:54:05,540
Military bandwidth.

5511
02:54:06,560 --> 02:54:07,940
Which one are we trying to find?

5512
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:09,980
Military, probably, right?

5513
02:54:10,460 --> 02:54:10,920
Yeah.

5514
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:13,040
Come in, please.

5515
02:54:13,700 --> 02:54:14,980
Do you read us?

5516
02:54:15,620 --> 02:54:16,080
Over.

5517
02:54:16,380 --> 02:54:16,840
Over.

5518
02:54:17,580 --> 02:54:19,340
Please, over.

5519
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:22,900
That guy doesn't... I don't think that guy's really...

5520
02:54:22,900 --> 02:54:25,120
At least there's someone listening.

5521
02:54:25,380 --> 02:54:26,500
The signal's in and out.

5522
02:54:26,540 --> 02:54:27,840
That guy is too panicked.

5523
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:30,040
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, too.

5524
02:54:30,260 --> 02:54:32,780
I'm gonna say our coordinates.

5525
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:35,520
If you can hear me, we're on board an abandoned freighter.

5526
02:54:35,800 --> 02:54:36,320
12 degrees, 30 minutes south.

5527
02:54:36,320 --> 02:54:38,640
Just like when it's 911, say your address first.

5528
02:54:39,120 --> 02:54:41,060
251 degrees, 20 minutes west.

5529
02:54:41,260 --> 02:54:41,640
Over.

5530
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:43,720
Please repeat.

5531
02:54:46,990 --> 02:54:48,430
Is this guy okay?

5532
02:54:48,770 --> 02:54:48,970
Why is he panicking?

5533
02:54:51,110 --> 02:54:51,970
Mayday, mayday.

5534
02:54:53,730 --> 02:54:54,670
Thank you, sir.

5535
02:54:56,090 --> 02:54:57,650
We're on a large freighter.

5536
02:54:57,770 --> 02:54:58,430
Say the address.

5537
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:59,370
Over.

5538
02:55:01,970 --> 02:55:02,810
Coordinates, coordinates!

5539
02:55:03,550 --> 02:55:04,050
Coordinates!

5540
02:55:04,710 --> 02:55:05,630
Come in, over.

5541
02:55:06,390 --> 02:55:08,290
Come in, come in, please, anyone.

5542
02:55:09,210 --> 02:55:10,170
Come in, over.

5543
02:55:11,450 --> 02:55:11,850
We screwed it up.

5544
02:55:11,910 --> 02:55:12,450
Oh, no!

5545
02:55:14,650 --> 02:55:15,730
Fliss, you ruined it.

5546
02:55:17,070 --> 02:55:17,610
What's this?

5547
02:55:18,290 --> 02:55:18,690
No!

5548
02:55:20,130 --> 02:55:21,210
Hey, come here, look!

5549
02:55:24,150 --> 02:55:24,950
Oh, no.

5550
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:26,390
Brad wants to go down.

5551
02:55:26,610 --> 02:55:28,050
Hey, look at this.

5552
02:55:28,150 --> 02:55:29,630
Bradley's awfully brave, isn't he?

5553
02:55:30,030 --> 02:55:31,330
Just push him in, Fliss.

5554
02:55:31,450 --> 02:55:32,050
Push him in.

5555
02:55:32,110 --> 02:55:34,450
This has got to lead somewhere.

5556
02:55:34,950 --> 02:55:37,050
Maybe we can find a way to get the power back.

5557
02:55:37,570 --> 02:55:38,830
Anywhere will lead somewhere.

5558
02:55:38,930 --> 02:55:39,150
We need to get that radio working.

5559
02:55:39,450 --> 02:55:42,170
I think someone should wait here in case a message comes through.

5560
02:55:42,450 --> 02:55:43,790
I'll go, obviously.

5561
02:55:44,450 --> 02:55:45,490
I can do this.

5562
02:55:46,430 --> 02:55:47,550
Let Brad go!

5563
02:55:47,830 --> 02:55:48,870
Let Brad go!

5564
02:55:50,450 --> 02:55:52,630
Sounds like you're scared of someone stepping out of your shadow.

5565
02:55:52,850 --> 02:55:55,030
Scared of my idiot brother getting himself killed?

5566
02:55:55,150 --> 02:55:55,710
You almost killed somebody!

5567
02:55:55,710 --> 02:55:56,890
How about showing me some brotherly love?

5568
02:55:56,950 --> 02:55:57,970
We should have left him to die.

5569
02:55:58,030 --> 02:55:58,990
We should have left him to die.

5570
02:56:00,250 --> 02:56:01,370
Oh, you decide.

5571
02:56:04,450 --> 02:56:05,850
If you're sure you're up for it.

5572
02:56:07,050 --> 02:56:07,630
If he dies, he dies.

5573
02:56:07,870 --> 02:56:08,570
If he dies, he dies.

5574
02:56:09,390 --> 02:56:10,270
Julia, what?

5575
02:56:10,450 --> 02:56:10,950
Julia, no.

5576
02:56:11,050 --> 02:56:12,090
She's not my bodyguard.

5577
02:56:12,250 --> 02:56:13,150
I can take care of myself.

5578
02:56:13,470 --> 02:56:13,790
What?

5579
02:56:13,850 --> 02:56:14,610
Why are you going?

5580
02:56:16,750 --> 02:56:17,750
Fliss and Brad again?

5581
02:56:19,390 --> 02:56:21,330
Julia says she can handle it.

5582
02:56:21,610 --> 02:56:22,690
She can handle it.

5583
02:56:23,670 --> 02:56:24,550
Case closed.

5584
02:56:25,430 --> 02:56:26,430
Oh, my God!

5585
02:56:26,650 --> 02:56:29,010
You guys left Julia and Brad.

5586
02:56:31,670 --> 02:56:33,710
One of us slain Julia and Brad.

5587
02:56:33,730 --> 02:56:34,790
Brad, the other.

5588
02:56:34,870 --> 02:56:36,190
Oh, my God.

5589
02:56:37,070 --> 02:56:40,190
Don't say that you're going to do it, if you're not going to do it.

5590
02:56:43,830 --> 02:56:47,170
Don't say that you're going to do it, if you're not going to do it.

5591
02:56:47,170 --> 02:56:47,710
Don't say that you're going to do it, if you're not going to do it.

5592
02:56:47,710 --> 02:56:47,810
Don't say that!

5593
02:56:47,810 --> 02:56:48,330
Oh, my God.

5594
02:56:48,650 --> 02:56:49,530
So loud.

5595
02:56:50,030 --> 02:56:51,730
I hope you get Julia and Brad.

5596
02:56:52,630 --> 02:56:53,770
Oh, I'm Julia.

5597
02:56:54,030 --> 02:56:55,890
I'm Julia, I'm Brad.

5598
02:56:56,370 --> 02:56:58,990
Julia definitely has tetanus.

5599
02:56:58,990 --> 02:57:00,510
She's all scraped up.

5600
02:57:00,730 --> 02:57:01,930
Oh, no.

5601
02:57:02,190 --> 02:57:02,990
Is everything still working?

5602
02:57:02,990 --> 02:57:02,990
Eric?

5603
02:57:04,590 --> 02:57:05,410
Everyone okay?

5604
02:57:07,870 --> 02:57:08,330
Decide.

5605
02:57:08,330 --> 02:57:09,130
Are we okay?

5606
02:57:10,310 --> 02:57:11,010
We're okay.

5607
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:12,570
Oh god, you're the crazier one.

5608
02:57:12,770 --> 02:57:15,030
You're gonna try and kill me at some point.

5609
02:57:16,670 --> 02:57:18,810
Now you'll know how I felt.

5610
02:57:19,050 --> 02:57:20,350
We're gonna have to find the generator.

5611
02:57:20,650 --> 02:57:23,110
If we can get it started, we can power up the radio.

5612
02:57:24,010 --> 02:57:24,470
Okay.

5613
02:57:24,790 --> 02:57:26,150
We'll wait here by the radio.

5614
02:57:26,430 --> 02:57:28,530
Finally, somebody's gonna die now.

5615
02:57:29,110 --> 02:57:30,190
Someone will die.

5616
02:57:30,570 --> 02:57:32,050
Oh, thanks for the tiny lighter.

5617
02:57:32,050 --> 02:57:32,490
Yes.

5618
02:57:34,310 --> 02:57:35,730
To set you on fire.

5619
02:57:37,030 --> 02:57:37,470
Let's go.

5620
02:57:37,790 --> 02:57:42,630
I feel like we should not put a lighter up with toxic gas around it.

5621
02:57:42,630 --> 02:57:43,210
I know, right?

5622
02:57:43,570 --> 02:57:45,590
It just doesn't feel like a very good idea.

5623
02:57:46,050 --> 02:57:46,490
Yeah.

5624
02:57:47,270 --> 02:57:48,010
Are you okay?

5625
02:57:48,190 --> 02:57:48,650
There you go.

5626
02:57:49,210 --> 02:57:49,750
After you.

5627
02:57:50,170 --> 02:57:53,390
Ooh, we look like real Scooby Doo gang.

5628
02:57:54,050 --> 02:57:55,650
Oh, was that the sick bed?

5629
02:57:55,790 --> 02:57:57,050
Is that what that said over there?

5630
02:57:58,470 --> 02:58:00,290
We need to find the generator.

5631
02:58:00,530 --> 02:58:01,770
Let's go to the sick bed.

5632
02:58:02,050 --> 02:58:02,670
Move it up, guys.

5633
02:58:03,610 --> 02:58:05,850
It's probably really nasty in here.

5634
02:58:06,670 --> 02:58:08,250
Really gassy in here.

5635
02:58:08,670 --> 02:58:12,350
That's where all the dirtiest of germs are.

5636
02:58:12,410 --> 02:58:13,690
This is where all the gas is.

5637
02:58:13,850 --> 02:58:14,190
There's a door here.

5638
02:58:14,490 --> 02:58:14,630
Yeah.

5639
02:58:15,030 --> 02:58:16,910
Inhale the gases, guys.

5640
02:58:18,330 --> 02:58:19,150
Sniffer, sniffer.

5641
02:58:19,870 --> 02:58:20,390
Yeah.

5642
02:58:21,310 --> 02:58:22,990
Yeah, I love going crazy.

5643
02:58:25,330 --> 02:58:26,370
More hallucinations.

5644
02:58:27,750 --> 02:58:29,030
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

5645
02:58:29,490 --> 02:58:30,770
Medical officers report.

5646
02:58:30,770 --> 02:58:43,970
Minutes of meeting between scientist X, CWO Walter Bishop and CWO Tom Palmer with Sergeant Peter Wood observing and X for meeting with our team and says we can mutually learn.

5647
02:58:44,570 --> 02:58:45,530
Wait, what'd you find?

5648
02:58:45,570 --> 02:58:47,750
Oh, my thing talks about Charles and Joe.

5649
02:58:47,950 --> 02:58:50,510
It talks about, like, Charles beating up Joe.

5650
02:58:51,050 --> 02:58:53,690
Oh, my thing talks about Manchurian.

5651
02:58:53,790 --> 02:58:54,730
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

5652
02:58:54,770 --> 02:58:56,290
Oh, this is actually really important.

5653
02:58:56,390 --> 02:58:56,550
Okay.

5654
02:58:56,610 --> 02:59:00,110
The United States has been aware of certain agencies investigating the chemical...

5655
02:59:00,110 --> 02:59:00,750
Yeah.

5656
02:59:00,750 --> 02:59:02,590
and biological agents in warfare.

5657
02:59:02,850 --> 02:59:03,690
Our act...

5658
02:59:03,690 --> 02:59:05,690
Limited by the Geneva Protocol...

5659
02:59:05,690 --> 02:59:06,770
Have experiments.

5660
02:59:06,910 --> 02:59:09,970
We are unable to describe...

5661
02:59:09,970 --> 02:59:12,230
Describes an investigation during...

5662
02:59:12,230 --> 02:59:19,410
To test the effects of human subjects on the molecule crystal structure hallucinogens codenamed Manchurian gold.

5663
02:59:20,510 --> 02:59:21,230
Chemical...

5664
02:59:21,230 --> 02:59:21,690
Oh, my God.

5665
02:59:21,750 --> 02:59:22,330
That is...

5666
02:59:22,330 --> 02:59:23,730
Munitions battle.

5667
02:59:23,990 --> 02:59:24,750
It was...

5668
02:59:24,750 --> 02:59:26,290
Even relatively minor.

5669
02:59:26,690 --> 02:59:28,750
Observed to trigger significant hallucinations.

5670
02:59:29,810 --> 02:59:30,530
Men...

5671
02:59:30,530 --> 02:59:31,710
Highly convincing...

5672
02:59:31,710 --> 02:59:35,470
Subjects seeing and hearing things that were not really there.

5673
02:59:35,570 --> 02:59:35,970
Even...

5674
02:59:35,970 --> 02:59:37,270
The danger was manifold.

5675
02:59:37,450 --> 02:59:37,790
And...

5676
02:59:37,790 --> 02:59:39,110
And its intensity.

5677
02:59:39,990 --> 02:59:40,330
Okay.

5678
02:59:40,350 --> 02:59:43,190
So, it is toxic gas that we're inhaling right now.

5679
02:59:46,850 --> 02:59:48,210
What else was over here?

5680
02:59:48,690 --> 02:59:49,410
It was nothing.

5681
02:59:49,730 --> 02:59:51,150
Lock me in jail, bad boy.

5682
02:59:54,130 --> 02:59:55,550
You have a boyfriend.

5683
02:59:55,830 --> 02:59:56,810
What the fuck?

5684
02:59:57,310 --> 02:59:59,210
I'm unhappy in my relationship.

5685
03:00:00,530 --> 03:00:01,310
I can tell.

5686
03:00:01,350 --> 03:00:03,570
I can tell you've been actively sabotaging it.

5687
03:00:05,270 --> 03:00:06,130
Oh, this is the...

5688
03:00:06,130 --> 03:00:07,590
Oh, this is where I was at.

5689
03:00:07,750 --> 03:00:08,370
Yeah, you're right.

5690
03:00:08,490 --> 03:00:09,510
This is a Charles...

5691
03:00:09,510 --> 03:00:12,310
The Charles and Jo beating up thing.

5692
03:00:12,410 --> 03:00:12,810
Yeah.

5693
03:00:13,070 --> 03:00:14,330
This is the thing I read.

5694
03:00:14,750 --> 03:00:16,670
And then there should be blood on the wall here.

5695
03:00:16,670 --> 03:00:19,370
I can't believe you tried an NTR with his brother.

5696
03:00:19,570 --> 03:00:20,490
That's fucked up.

5697
03:00:20,750 --> 03:00:22,510
Yeah, there's the blood that I saw earlier.

5698
03:00:23,070 --> 03:00:23,990
Oh, my gosh.

5699
03:00:24,590 --> 03:00:25,630
Don't worry about it.

5700
03:00:25,790 --> 03:00:26,190
Anyway.

5701
03:00:28,990 --> 03:00:30,510
Guys, the longer we stay here...

5702
03:00:30,510 --> 03:00:32,750
The more toxic gas we're gonna get.

5703
03:00:33,410 --> 03:00:33,830
Ooh.

5704
03:00:34,210 --> 03:00:35,090
Toxic gas.

5705
03:00:36,330 --> 03:00:37,650
I can't wait to see children.

5706
03:00:37,670 --> 03:00:38,150
Yummy.

5707
03:00:38,230 --> 03:00:40,110
I can't wait to see the kids.

5708
03:00:41,070 --> 03:00:41,550
Ooh.

5709
03:00:41,670 --> 03:00:42,270
How did you...

5710
03:00:42,270 --> 03:00:42,430
Whoa.

5711
03:00:43,070 --> 03:00:43,730
That's me.

5712
03:00:43,890 --> 03:00:44,690
I'm in the sick bay.

5713
03:00:44,890 --> 03:00:45,150
Whoa.

5714
03:00:45,470 --> 03:00:46,470
Did you hear that?

5715
03:00:46,810 --> 03:00:47,610
I heard...

5716
03:00:47,610 --> 03:00:48,190
Oh, that's the body.

5717
03:00:48,270 --> 03:00:49,310
That's the dead body I found.

5718
03:00:49,650 --> 03:00:50,190
That's him.

5719
03:00:50,570 --> 03:00:51,130
The little kid?

5720
03:00:51,870 --> 03:00:52,310
What?

5721
03:00:52,330 --> 03:00:54,370
Maybe this was somebody's son from on board?

5722
03:00:54,730 --> 03:00:55,310
Two pops.

5723
03:00:55,550 --> 03:00:56,270
Come back soon.

5724
03:00:57,350 --> 03:00:59,350
No, there's a dead body literally right next to me.

5725
03:00:59,510 --> 03:00:59,850
Where?

5726
03:00:59,850 --> 03:00:59,990
There.

5727
03:01:00,010 --> 03:01:00,950
I'm gonna go see it.

5728
03:01:01,030 --> 03:01:01,150
Oh.

5729
03:01:02,210 --> 03:01:03,510
I don't see a body.

5730
03:01:04,090 --> 03:01:04,570
Let's see.

5731
03:01:04,570 --> 03:01:05,930
There's literally no body here.

5732
03:01:06,670 --> 03:01:07,150
Wait.

5733
03:01:07,210 --> 03:01:07,410
What?

5734
03:01:07,410 --> 03:01:07,710
Oh!

5735
03:01:07,710 --> 03:01:08,350
On the ground.

5736
03:01:08,770 --> 03:01:09,170
Yeah.

5737
03:01:09,210 --> 03:01:11,150
I mean, like, what do you mean?

5738
03:01:11,610 --> 03:01:12,090
Oh.

5739
03:01:12,250 --> 03:01:12,730
Arf.

5740
03:01:14,410 --> 03:01:15,490
I'm looking at him.

5741
03:01:15,970 --> 03:01:16,450
Aw.

5742
03:01:16,450 --> 03:01:16,770
What is this?

5743
03:01:16,910 --> 03:01:17,530
Is this important?

5744
03:01:18,150 --> 03:01:24,010
I observed signs of severe distress consistent with evidence of panic observed in the same soldier during his watch duty.

5745
03:01:24,170 --> 03:01:26,610
Oh, it's talking about the hallucination that he's been getting.

5746
03:01:26,710 --> 03:01:27,010
Yeah.

5747
03:01:27,250 --> 03:01:27,730
Ooh.

5748
03:01:28,250 --> 03:01:28,890
Manchurian gold.

5749
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:29,670
Manchurian gold.

5750
03:01:30,070 --> 03:01:30,790
Manchurian gold.

5751
03:01:30,830 --> 03:01:30,930
Manchurian gold.

5752
03:01:30,930 --> 03:01:30,970
Yeah.

5753
03:01:31,050 --> 03:01:31,710
This is the body.

5754
03:01:32,010 --> 03:01:32,390
Yeah.

5755
03:01:32,410 --> 03:01:32,650
Yeah.

5756
03:01:32,650 --> 03:01:33,590
This dead body.

5757
03:01:33,990 --> 03:01:34,370
Yeah.

5758
03:01:34,470 --> 03:01:35,110
I didn't see him.

5759
03:01:35,210 --> 03:01:36,510
I thought he went in the bed.

5760
03:01:36,930 --> 03:01:39,010
Because that's where, like, sick bodies normally would be.

5761
03:01:39,230 --> 03:01:39,610
Yeah.

5762
03:01:39,630 --> 03:01:42,490
He was stuffed in this closet locker.

5763
03:01:42,670 --> 03:01:42,950
Oh!

5764
03:01:43,830 --> 03:01:44,210
Yeah.

5765
03:01:44,290 --> 03:01:44,570
Yeah.

5766
03:01:44,570 --> 03:01:45,270
You saved him.

5767
03:01:45,270 --> 03:01:45,730
That was, like...

5768
03:01:46,370 --> 03:01:46,750
Yeah.

5769
03:01:46,870 --> 03:01:48,470
Like, a hundred years ago.

5770
03:01:48,730 --> 03:01:49,110
Wait.

5771
03:01:49,190 --> 03:01:49,590
Where did you go?

5772
03:01:50,310 --> 03:01:50,890
I'm here.

5773
03:01:50,890 --> 03:01:51,290
Oh, there you are.

5774
03:01:52,230 --> 03:01:53,270
I was like...

5775
03:01:53,270 --> 03:01:54,170
Oh, this way?

5776
03:01:54,170 --> 03:01:55,790
Are we splitting up already?

5777
03:01:56,130 --> 03:01:56,390
Yeah.

5778
03:01:56,430 --> 03:01:57,030
We're splitting up.

5779
03:01:57,390 --> 03:01:58,550
We gotta get that generator.

5780
03:01:58,870 --> 03:01:59,230
Oh, come on.

5781
03:01:59,270 --> 03:01:59,610
Go.

5782
03:01:59,670 --> 03:02:00,130
I'm stuck.

5783
03:02:00,250 --> 03:02:00,630
Wait.

5784
03:02:00,650 --> 03:02:00,930
Hold on.

5785
03:02:00,930 --> 03:02:01,290
Stuck.

5786
03:02:01,410 --> 03:02:01,690
Really?

5787
03:02:03,530 --> 03:02:04,790
We can go down.

5788
03:02:05,190 --> 03:02:06,170
Let's see what's around.

5789
03:02:06,410 --> 03:02:08,170
We can only go down.

5790
03:02:08,590 --> 03:02:08,990
Go down.

5791
03:02:10,350 --> 03:02:11,210
Ladies first.

5792
03:02:11,390 --> 03:02:11,730
Nope.

5793
03:02:11,750 --> 03:02:13,950
I think Bradley's the lady right here.

5794
03:02:14,130 --> 03:02:14,610
Okay.

5795
03:02:15,110 --> 03:02:15,590
Touche.

5796
03:02:17,250 --> 03:02:18,370
Here, come check this out.

5797
03:02:20,290 --> 03:02:20,770
Yeah.

5798
03:02:20,870 --> 03:02:21,970
I found the ladder.

5799
03:02:22,450 --> 03:02:22,850
Oh.

5800
03:02:22,990 --> 03:02:23,470
Sure.

5801
03:02:23,510 --> 03:02:23,950
Yeah.

5802
03:02:23,990 --> 03:02:24,150
Yeah.

5803
03:02:24,170 --> 03:02:24,370
Wait.

5804
03:02:24,370 --> 03:02:24,990
What are you looking at?

5805
03:02:25,390 --> 03:02:26,270
Is this the generator?

5806
03:02:26,830 --> 03:02:27,110
Oh.

5807
03:02:27,110 --> 03:02:29,050
Gotta find the kitchen, Raggy.

5808
03:02:32,170 --> 03:02:33,910
Well, it sure looks gassy in here.

5809
03:02:35,330 --> 03:02:36,030
Rock roll.

5810
03:02:37,370 --> 03:02:37,930
Uh-oh.

5811
03:02:38,250 --> 03:02:39,750
I think I can just...

5812
03:02:39,750 --> 03:02:40,330
Wait.

5813
03:02:41,890 --> 03:02:42,330
Ow.

5814
03:02:42,430 --> 03:02:42,790
Are you okay?

5815
03:02:43,050 --> 03:02:43,450
Ooh.

5816
03:02:43,850 --> 03:02:44,290
Dang.

5817
03:02:44,350 --> 03:02:45,110
Come down here.

5818
03:02:45,230 --> 03:02:46,170
Come down here, Julia.

5819
03:02:47,070 --> 03:02:50,530
She won't be able to get back up if you tell her to come down.

5820
03:02:51,370 --> 03:02:52,150
Come down.

5821
03:02:52,310 --> 03:02:53,210
Oh, my God.

5822
03:02:53,210 --> 03:02:54,010
You have shoes.

5823
03:02:54,030 --> 03:02:54,150
You have shoes.

5824
03:02:54,170 --> 03:02:55,170
I have bare feet.

5825
03:02:56,870 --> 03:02:58,010
I'm just a lady.

5826
03:02:58,490 --> 03:02:58,890
Please.

5827
03:02:59,570 --> 03:03:00,370
Oh, God.

5828
03:03:00,630 --> 03:03:00,930
What's up?

5829
03:03:01,050 --> 03:03:02,470
It was...

5830
03:03:02,470 --> 03:03:02,910
Wait.

5831
03:03:02,990 --> 03:03:03,570
I didn't see anything.

5832
03:03:03,690 --> 03:03:04,390
I just heard it.

5833
03:03:04,530 --> 03:03:05,070
Did you see it?

5834
03:03:05,070 --> 03:03:05,190
Me too.

5835
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:06,070
I just heard it too.

5836
03:03:06,170 --> 03:03:07,710
I was not paying attention.

5837
03:03:07,950 --> 03:03:08,570
I don't think there was something there.

5838
03:03:08,570 --> 03:03:08,930
Okay.

5839
03:03:08,930 --> 03:03:11,090
So, I'm seeing things, but you're not.

5840
03:03:12,370 --> 03:03:12,770
Okay.

5841
03:03:12,810 --> 03:03:14,490
So, follow my thinking here.

5842
03:03:14,590 --> 03:03:14,890
Okay.

5843
03:03:14,890 --> 03:03:16,710
We know this ship was carrying the Manchurian gold.

5844
03:03:16,890 --> 03:03:17,250
Yeah.

5845
03:03:17,330 --> 03:03:21,710
But that was really some sort of hallucinogenic bioweapon developed in China during World War II.

5846
03:03:21,930 --> 03:03:22,330
Right.

5847
03:03:22,330 --> 03:03:23,990
And we know that it was...

5848
03:03:23,990 --> 03:03:24,570
It was super unstable.

5849
03:03:25,170 --> 03:03:26,290
And it leaked all over the ship.

5850
03:03:26,410 --> 03:03:26,690
Yeah.

5851
03:03:26,750 --> 03:03:28,130
So, maybe it's still here.

5852
03:03:28,750 --> 03:03:30,410
Maybe it hasn't dispersed after 70 years.

5853
03:03:30,470 --> 03:03:30,590
Wait.

5854
03:03:30,590 --> 03:03:30,930
But why am I...

5855
03:03:30,930 --> 03:03:32,270
But it's having the same effect on us.

5856
03:03:32,290 --> 03:03:32,490
You know?

5857
03:03:32,490 --> 03:03:32,770
Oh.

5858
03:03:32,810 --> 03:03:33,770
Paranoid hallucinations.

5859
03:03:33,870 --> 03:03:34,130
Yeah.

5860
03:03:34,170 --> 03:03:34,910
Oh, my God, Brad.

5861
03:03:34,930 --> 03:03:35,790
You're so smart.

5862
03:03:36,210 --> 03:03:36,730
It's not like we figured that out.

5863
03:03:36,730 --> 03:03:37,730
It's not like we figured that out.

5864
03:03:38,210 --> 03:03:38,730
He's the...

5865
03:03:38,730 --> 03:03:39,910
He's the brainy nerd.

5866
03:03:40,190 --> 03:03:43,810
And the officers thought it was just a bunch of jumpy GIs trying to get out of guard duty.

5867
03:03:43,950 --> 03:03:45,070
This isn't a ghost ship.

5868
03:03:45,150 --> 03:03:46,850
It's a floating bioweapon.

5869
03:03:46,950 --> 03:03:47,590
That's crazy.

5870
03:03:47,690 --> 03:03:50,450
We might die because the military wants to keep it a secret.

5871
03:03:50,730 --> 03:03:51,050
Yeah.

5872
03:03:51,070 --> 03:03:51,430
Ooh.

5873
03:03:52,190 --> 03:03:53,210
I mean, maybe there was a connection.

5874
03:03:54,230 --> 03:03:55,290
Maybe they made contact.

5875
03:03:55,650 --> 03:03:57,450
Maybe in the end, only Conrad survives.

5876
03:03:58,210 --> 03:03:58,650
It's a theory.

5877
03:03:58,650 --> 03:03:58,770
Oh, my God.

5878
03:03:58,770 --> 03:03:59,630
None of us...

5879
03:04:00,150 --> 03:04:00,730
All right.

5880
03:04:00,870 --> 03:04:01,570
Let's get going.

5881
03:04:01,610 --> 03:04:01,730
Nobody here lives.

5882
03:04:03,530 --> 03:04:04,950
Because that's usually how it goes.

5883
03:04:05,030 --> 03:04:06,310
The military wants to keep it a secret.

5884
03:04:06,550 --> 03:04:06,730
Yeah.

5885
03:04:06,730 --> 03:04:07,390
They'll be like...

5886
03:04:07,390 --> 03:04:07,770
So, they'll be like...

5887
03:04:07,770 --> 03:04:09,490
Well, we know those coordinates.

5888
03:04:10,070 --> 03:04:10,510
Yeah.

5889
03:04:10,510 --> 03:04:10,890
No.

5890
03:04:10,950 --> 03:04:12,050
They'll be like...

5891
03:04:12,050 --> 03:04:13,350
We'll be like, we're saved.

5892
03:04:13,430 --> 03:04:14,690
And then the military shoots us.

5893
03:04:15,090 --> 03:04:16,250
That's how it always goes.

5894
03:04:16,370 --> 03:04:16,710
Yup.

5895
03:04:17,870 --> 03:04:18,310
Oh.

5896
03:04:18,530 --> 03:04:18,970
Netherland.

5897
03:04:20,290 --> 03:04:21,170
Diesel engine.

5898
03:04:21,510 --> 03:04:21,550
Netherlands?

5899
03:04:22,670 --> 03:04:23,110
Oh.

5900
03:04:23,230 --> 03:04:23,670
Rotterdam.

5901
03:04:23,730 --> 03:04:23,970
Oh.

5902
03:04:23,990 --> 03:04:24,250
Yeah.

5903
03:04:25,310 --> 03:04:26,010
Oh, here.

5904
03:04:26,030 --> 03:04:26,190
Oh, my God.

5905
03:04:26,390 --> 03:04:27,910
This is not an American ship.

5906
03:04:28,210 --> 03:04:28,650
No.

5907
03:04:28,950 --> 03:04:29,910
Oh, my God.

5908
03:04:29,930 --> 03:04:30,810
It's not American at all.

5909
03:04:31,090 --> 03:04:32,290
It's not made in America.

5910
03:04:32,770 --> 03:04:34,170
They lied to us.

5911
03:04:34,390 --> 03:04:35,470
How dare they?

5912
03:04:35,570 --> 03:04:36,330
You go the other way.

5913
03:04:36,330 --> 03:04:37,250
You explore the other way.

5914
03:04:37,270 --> 03:04:37,750
No.

5915
03:04:38,210 --> 03:04:39,430
We're not splitting up.

5916
03:04:39,450 --> 03:04:39,770
Yeah.

5917
03:04:39,770 --> 03:04:39,990
Why not?

5918
03:04:41,090 --> 03:04:44,230
I can't believe we outsourced this ship to Europeans.

5919
03:04:45,250 --> 03:04:46,410
That's why it's cursed.

5920
03:04:47,130 --> 03:04:47,610
That's...

5921
03:04:51,010 --> 03:04:53,470
I don't think there's anything over here except gas.

5922
03:04:53,490 --> 03:04:53,910
Look at this.

5923
03:04:53,990 --> 03:04:54,910
I didn't say about...

5924
03:04:54,910 --> 03:04:55,030
Huff it up.

5925
03:04:55,070 --> 03:04:55,170
Huff it up.

5926
03:04:56,250 --> 03:04:57,070
Huff up the gas.

5927
03:04:57,150 --> 03:04:57,910
Huff up the gas.

5928
03:04:58,130 --> 03:04:58,730
Huff up the gas.

5929
03:05:00,010 --> 03:05:00,810
My delusions.

5930
03:05:01,050 --> 03:05:01,730
Oh, my God.

5931
03:05:01,750 --> 03:05:02,590
Anime girl...

5932
03:05:02,590 --> 03:05:03,790
Anime girls are real.

5933
03:05:04,370 --> 03:05:05,030
We're gonna see the children.

5934
03:05:05,030 --> 03:05:05,730
We're gonna see the children.

5935
03:05:05,770 --> 03:05:06,270
It's this way.

5936
03:05:06,270 --> 03:05:06,890
There's stuff here.

5937
03:05:07,070 --> 03:05:07,450
Oh, okay.

5938
03:05:07,930 --> 03:05:09,310
I'm seeing anime girls.

5939
03:05:09,450 --> 03:05:10,170
Oh, my gosh.

5940
03:05:10,350 --> 03:05:10,810
Oh, my God.

5941
03:05:10,930 --> 03:05:12,630
Remember to huff up the gas.

5942
03:05:12,650 --> 03:05:13,310
Huff up the gas.

5943
03:05:16,910 --> 03:05:17,710
Oh, what's this?

5944
03:05:17,950 --> 03:05:18,170
Wait.

5945
03:05:18,250 --> 03:05:18,970
Did we come this way?

5946
03:05:19,770 --> 03:05:20,170
No.

5947
03:05:20,190 --> 03:05:20,890
We didn't.

5948
03:05:21,070 --> 03:05:22,610
We came from upstairs.

5949
03:05:23,330 --> 03:05:23,970
And it's like a...

5950
03:05:23,990 --> 03:05:24,550
Oh, you're right.

5951
03:05:27,010 --> 03:05:27,410
Yeah.

5952
03:05:27,530 --> 03:05:28,070
This is it.

5953
03:05:28,090 --> 03:05:28,350
All right.

5954
03:05:28,810 --> 03:05:30,650
Just throw the switch and let's get back upstairs.

5955
03:05:30,870 --> 03:05:31,150
How?

5956
03:05:31,330 --> 03:05:31,730
How?

5957
03:05:31,890 --> 03:05:32,090
Yeah.

5958
03:05:32,170 --> 03:05:32,430
Yeah.

5959
03:05:32,430 --> 03:05:33,610
How do we go back upstairs?

5960
03:05:34,330 --> 03:05:34,730
Okay.

5961
03:05:35,510 --> 03:05:36,370
Let's get back upstairs.

5962
03:05:37,330 --> 03:05:38,590
There's gotta be another way up.

5963
03:05:39,230 --> 03:05:39,630
Sure.

5964
03:05:39,930 --> 03:05:40,110
Oh.

5965
03:05:40,830 --> 03:05:41,230
Yay.

5966
03:05:44,050 --> 03:05:44,450
Baby.

5967
03:05:44,530 --> 03:05:45,970
We've lost power, but we have it back.

5968
03:05:46,190 --> 03:05:46,830
Can you hear me?

5969
03:05:47,370 --> 03:05:47,770
Over.

5970
03:05:49,610 --> 03:05:51,450
Please make your situation over.

5971
03:05:51,730 --> 03:05:52,130
Cool.

5972
03:05:52,270 --> 03:05:53,510
We need help now.

5973
03:05:53,990 --> 03:05:56,310
There are things on the ship that are trying to hurt us.

5974
03:05:56,470 --> 03:05:56,950
Over.

5975
03:05:57,850 --> 03:06:00,010
Recovery mission is on route to your location.

5976
03:06:00,310 --> 03:06:00,590
Over.

5977
03:06:00,750 --> 03:06:01,230
Oh.

5978
03:06:01,970 --> 03:06:02,450
Oh.

5979
03:06:02,550 --> 03:06:03,030
Again?

5980
03:06:03,410 --> 03:06:03,970
Come on.

5981
03:06:03,990 --> 03:06:04,750
Work, dammit.

5982
03:06:05,650 --> 03:06:06,130
Okay.

5983
03:06:06,290 --> 03:06:06,770
Well...

5984
03:06:06,770 --> 03:06:07,270
Okay.

5985
03:06:07,330 --> 03:06:07,570
Well...

5986
03:06:07,570 --> 03:06:09,210
We have people coming to shoot us.

5987
03:06:09,510 --> 03:06:09,990
Yeah.

5988
03:06:09,990 --> 03:06:11,190
We have people coming to shoot you.

5989
03:06:12,110 --> 03:06:12,830
Oh, my God.

5990
03:06:13,050 --> 03:06:14,090
We did it.

5991
03:06:14,210 --> 03:06:15,250
We did it.

5992
03:06:15,250 --> 03:06:16,270
We did it.

5993
03:06:16,350 --> 03:06:21,630
There's a way over here, but there was also a other area all the way on the other side.

5994
03:06:22,050 --> 03:06:23,090
Oh, gas.

5995
03:06:23,650 --> 03:06:24,550
Sweet, sweet gas.

5996
03:06:24,570 --> 03:06:25,150
Sweet, sweet gas.

5997
03:06:25,450 --> 03:06:26,630
My waifu will...

5998
03:06:26,630 --> 03:06:27,450
She will be mine.

5999
03:06:28,830 --> 03:06:29,430
Oh, my God.

6000
03:06:29,450 --> 03:06:31,110
This is how your waifu's become 3D.

6001
03:06:35,450 --> 03:06:36,210
No, 3DPD.

6002
03:06:36,270 --> 03:06:36,650
We won't...

6003
03:06:36,650 --> 03:06:37,510
Oh, there's a dead guy here.

6004
03:06:38,290 --> 03:06:38,670
Wait.

6005
03:06:38,690 --> 03:06:39,070
Where are you?

6006
03:06:39,210 --> 03:06:40,290
I'm looking at a dead guy.

6007
03:06:40,770 --> 03:06:41,150
Whoa.

6008
03:06:41,270 --> 03:06:41,990
Where did you go?

6009
03:06:43,010 --> 03:06:44,710
He is not looking so hot.

6010
03:06:45,350 --> 03:06:46,730
Where the fuck did you go?

6011
03:06:46,790 --> 03:06:47,630
Did you go this way?

6012
03:06:48,530 --> 03:06:49,090
I split up.

6013
03:06:49,090 --> 03:06:50,170
Oh, we definitely split up.

6014
03:06:50,170 --> 03:06:51,150
I split up, Doki.

6015
03:06:51,270 --> 03:06:51,610
Chloe.

6016
03:06:51,810 --> 03:06:53,050
I split up, Doki.

6017
03:06:53,050 --> 03:06:53,070
I split up, Doki.

6018
03:06:53,070 --> 03:06:53,250
Okay.

6019
03:06:53,290 --> 03:06:53,790
Oh, wait.

6020
03:06:53,890 --> 03:06:54,110
What?

6021
03:06:54,690 --> 03:06:55,290
What the hell?

6022
03:06:55,310 --> 03:06:55,890
I brought you back.

6023
03:06:58,610 --> 03:07:00,550
The fisherman must have bothered over from the Duke of Milan.

6024
03:07:01,170 --> 03:07:02,270
You think it still works?

6025
03:07:02,810 --> 03:07:03,670
Looks like it's got a little juice left.

6026
03:07:03,670 --> 03:07:04,110
Wait, they were here?

6027
03:07:04,450 --> 03:07:05,270
Maybe a couple of minutes.

6028
03:07:05,910 --> 03:07:06,930
Should we bring it with us?

6029
03:07:06,950 --> 03:07:07,490
I mean, it's heavy.

6030
03:07:09,090 --> 03:07:09,590
Yeah, take it.

6031
03:07:09,590 --> 03:07:10,130
Still, you should.

6032
03:07:10,250 --> 03:07:10,870
Might as well.

6033
03:07:11,090 --> 03:07:11,810
Yeah, why not?

6034
03:07:12,070 --> 03:07:12,870
Hell, yeah, we should.

6035
03:07:13,030 --> 03:07:14,110
Half the boat is submerged.

6036
03:07:14,850 --> 03:07:15,170
Yeah.

6037
03:07:19,010 --> 03:07:19,650
The crows.

6038
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:20,610
Uh-oh.

6039
03:07:21,690 --> 03:07:22,330
Oh, no.

6040
03:07:22,410 --> 03:07:22,610
Just when we need to...

6041
03:07:22,610 --> 03:07:22,670
Oh, no.

6042
03:07:22,670 --> 03:07:24,270
Just when we need to...

6043
03:07:24,270 --> 03:07:24,390
Oh, no.

6044
03:07:24,390 --> 03:07:25,190
Oh, no.

6045
03:07:26,030 --> 03:07:26,050
Yeah.

6046
03:07:26,110 --> 03:07:27,450
You're right.

6047
03:07:28,570 --> 03:07:29,270
Oh, no.

6048
03:07:29,270 --> 03:07:29,310
Oh, no.

6049
03:07:29,310 --> 03:07:29,490
You're right.

6050
03:07:29,490 --> 03:07:31,430
This is where he's going to shoot himself?

6051
03:07:31,870 --> 03:07:32,870
Wait, what the fuck?

6052
03:07:33,090 --> 03:07:33,390
Oh.

6053
03:07:35,050 --> 03:07:36,370
Oh, he's...

6054
03:07:36,370 --> 03:07:37,750
He's totally lost it.

6055
03:07:37,770 --> 03:07:38,470
He's totally lost it.

6056
03:07:38,470 --> 03:07:39,550
Yeah, he's crazy.

6057
03:07:42,170 --> 03:07:43,290
Uh-oh.

6058
03:07:44,110 --> 03:07:45,270
Oh, you see it?

6059
03:07:46,430 --> 03:07:46,990
Uh.

6060
03:07:49,130 --> 03:07:51,390
Wow, imagine the smell in there.

6061
03:07:51,650 --> 03:07:52,210
It's so good.

6062
03:07:52,210 --> 03:07:53,850
Is it a ram?

6063
03:07:53,850 --> 03:07:54,370
Let's see.

6064
03:07:54,390 --> 03:07:55,450
What is he doing?

6065
03:07:56,750 --> 03:07:57,670
That's the guy...

6066
03:07:57,670 --> 03:07:58,290
There's the...

6067
03:07:58,290 --> 03:07:59,430
Oh, there's the thing!

6068
03:07:59,550 --> 03:08:00,110
The after the pole!

6069
03:08:02,410 --> 03:08:03,770
What is he trying to do?

6070
03:08:03,910 --> 03:08:04,630
Is he going to cut him?

6071
03:08:05,990 --> 03:08:08,390
He's opening... He's going to open him up to see his secrets.

6072
03:08:10,390 --> 03:08:11,810
There's gold inside him.

6073
03:08:11,970 --> 03:08:13,270
There's gold inside him.

6074
03:08:13,290 --> 03:08:13,930
Open him up!

6075
03:08:14,130 --> 03:08:15,070
Open me up!

6076
03:08:15,130 --> 03:08:15,950
There's gold inside!

6077
03:08:18,430 --> 03:08:19,770
Oh, he's hallucinating.

6078
03:08:20,290 --> 03:08:21,390
He's hallucinating again.

6079
03:08:22,010 --> 03:08:23,510
You could totally like scare him.

6080
03:08:23,530 --> 03:08:23,930
Just be like...

6081
03:08:25,550 --> 03:08:26,410
Just be like...

6082
03:08:26,410 --> 03:08:27,510
I see you.

6083
03:08:27,730 --> 03:08:28,330
Oh my god.

6084
03:08:28,390 --> 03:08:28,750
Okay, okay.

6085
03:08:28,750 --> 03:08:29,190
Don't you dare.

6086
03:08:29,230 --> 03:08:30,290
Don't you dare fuck this up.

6087
03:08:30,450 --> 03:08:31,230
Don't you dare.

6088
03:08:32,550 --> 03:08:32,990
Okay.

6089
03:08:33,590 --> 03:08:34,030
Okay.

6090
03:08:38,070 --> 03:08:39,830
There's a lot of pressure here, Doki.

6091
03:08:39,850 --> 03:08:40,850
There's a lot of...

6092
03:08:41,530 --> 03:08:42,730
There's a lot of pressure.

6093
03:08:45,210 --> 03:08:47,850
There's a lot of pressure.

6094
03:08:49,070 --> 03:08:51,190
No, I didn't!

6095
03:08:51,890 --> 03:08:52,970
I didn't fail!

6096
03:08:57,540 --> 03:08:58,380
It sounds like you.

6097
03:08:58,640 --> 03:08:59,000
You failed.

6098
03:09:00,100 --> 03:09:00,900
Avoid Olsen?

6099
03:09:01,040 --> 03:09:01,340
Uh-oh.

6100
03:09:01,420 --> 03:09:02,100
What are we supposed to do?

6101
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:05,640
I have time to read notes, right?

6102
03:09:05,780 --> 03:09:06,020
Okay.

6103
03:09:08,040 --> 03:09:08,580
Wait, what?

6104
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:10,660
Oh my god.

6105
03:09:10,700 --> 03:09:11,620
There's mucho texto.

6106
03:09:12,960 --> 03:09:13,560
Wait, what?

6107
03:09:14,860 --> 03:09:17,240
Human bodies that have undergone mistreatment.

6108
03:09:17,620 --> 03:09:19,800
I don't think we have time to read!

6109
03:09:20,260 --> 03:09:21,120
Okay, I'm coming.

6110
03:09:21,180 --> 03:09:21,780
What's going on?

6111
03:09:24,800 --> 03:09:25,820
Oh, what's going on?

6112
03:09:27,060 --> 03:09:27,620
Oh god!

6113
03:09:27,620 --> 03:09:28,280
Hide!

6114
03:09:28,660 --> 03:09:29,100
Hide!

6115
03:09:29,180 --> 03:09:29,300
Oh.

6116
03:09:29,820 --> 03:09:30,840
We've got to split.

6117
03:09:31,400 --> 03:09:31,700
What?

6118
03:09:31,740 --> 03:09:32,020
Split?

6119
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:32,560
We've got to split!

6120
03:09:33,620 --> 03:09:34,800
He's holding something.

6121
03:09:35,040 --> 03:09:36,500
I'm just going to check it real quick.

6122
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:40,720
There's something in there!

6123
03:09:41,380 --> 03:09:42,300
Holy shit.

6124
03:09:42,360 --> 03:09:45,020
I swear to God...

6125
03:09:49,900 --> 03:09:52,200
I swear to God.

6126
03:09:52,500 --> 03:09:54,380
I swear to God.

6127
03:09:54,700 --> 03:09:56,180
I was just curious.

6128
03:09:57,800 --> 03:09:59,640
I was just curious.

6129
03:10:04,340 --> 03:10:09,940
This guy, he can only, he's, you know, he can only hallucinate and...

6130
03:10:13,220 --> 03:10:15,760
He'll hallucinate us, killing us, it's fine.

6131
03:10:17,060 --> 03:10:18,540
Where are we gonna go anyway?

6132
03:10:21,460 --> 03:10:22,780
Oh no, again?

6133
03:10:22,940 --> 03:10:24,360
Oh god, oh god, please.

6134
03:10:24,360 --> 03:10:29,280
You can have all the gold, and I'm to be left here to die.

6135
03:10:30,140 --> 03:10:31,640
But I am...

6136
03:10:32,360 --> 03:10:34,880
Rin, Rin, I swear to god!

6137
03:10:35,160 --> 03:10:37,580
I told you it's so much pressure!

6138
03:10:38,020 --> 03:10:38,760
I knew it!

6139
03:10:38,760 --> 03:10:40,520
I knew I shouldn't have given you the pressure!

6140
03:10:40,780 --> 03:10:43,380
If I can't give you pressure, then okay!

6141
03:10:45,140 --> 03:10:46,980
It's fine, we'll just kill him!

6142
03:10:47,260 --> 03:10:48,660
We'll just kill him!

6143
03:10:49,620 --> 03:10:50,820
I joked!

6144
03:10:51,120 --> 03:10:53,320
I joked!

6145
03:10:53,320 --> 03:10:55,060
I told you I sucked at giving you pressure!

6146
03:10:56,700 --> 03:10:57,960
See, it's fine!

6147
03:11:00,940 --> 03:11:02,100
Just keep going!

6148
03:11:02,480 --> 03:11:02,900
Just keep...

6149
03:11:04,320 --> 03:11:07,260
Bradley, please.

6150
03:11:07,580 --> 03:11:08,940
The doors are rusted.

6151
03:11:09,020 --> 03:11:10,000
Come on, we gotta keep going.

6152
03:11:15,440 --> 03:11:17,780
This is where he tries to shoot, where he tries to shoot himself.

6153
03:11:17,780 --> 03:11:19,520
Yeah, this is the guy that I saw shoot himself.

6154
03:11:24,300 --> 03:11:24,700
Slow.

6155
03:11:24,700 --> 03:11:25,520
Real slow.

6156
03:11:25,660 --> 03:11:27,320
Then we'll get a gun, it'll be fine.

6157
03:11:28,780 --> 03:11:29,880
Yeah, real slow.

6158
03:11:30,300 --> 03:11:30,700
Okay.

6159
03:11:32,140 --> 03:11:33,260
Why is he here?

6160
03:11:33,520 --> 03:11:33,960
None of that.

6161
03:11:34,300 --> 03:11:35,020
No changing.

6162
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:35,720
Put your hands up!

6163
03:11:36,320 --> 03:11:36,720
Slow.

6164
03:11:37,980 --> 03:11:38,940
Yeah, why is he here?

6165
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:39,640
How did he get here?

6166
03:11:39,760 --> 03:11:41,440
Not like that.

6167
03:11:41,640 --> 03:11:42,280
What do you mean, not...

6168
03:11:42,280 --> 03:11:43,800
I said, no changing.

6169
03:11:44,140 --> 03:11:44,420
What?

6170
03:11:46,760 --> 03:11:48,100
Mint, I swear to god.

6171
03:11:48,600 --> 03:11:49,560
It's so cute!

6172
03:11:51,040 --> 03:11:51,940
It's so cute!

6173
03:11:52,180 --> 03:11:52,880
It's so cute!

6174
03:11:53,700 --> 03:11:55,180
I'm not... I'm not...

6175
03:11:55,180 --> 03:11:56,660
Please, we've got no problem with you.

6176
03:11:56,700 --> 03:11:57,340
Mint, I swear...

6177
03:11:57,340 --> 03:11:58,360
We just wanna get out of here.

6178
03:11:59,440 --> 03:11:59,840
Please.

6179
03:12:00,860 --> 03:12:05,740
I'm sorry, but if you're breathing, then you don't get much of a choice in the matter.

6180
03:12:06,160 --> 03:12:07,380
You don't got a say.

6181
03:12:07,580 --> 03:12:07,980
What?

6182
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:08,500
What do you mean?

6183
03:12:09,420 --> 03:12:10,620
Oh, he's seeing him.

6184
03:12:10,820 --> 03:12:11,500
He's seeing him.

6185
03:12:11,540 --> 03:12:11,780
Not again.

6186
03:12:12,740 --> 03:12:14,180
It's all gone changing on me.

6187
03:12:14,660 --> 03:12:15,360
Oh, the gas.

6188
03:12:15,380 --> 03:12:15,660
What?

6189
03:12:15,660 --> 03:12:16,260
What's changing?

6190
03:12:16,420 --> 03:12:16,860
The gas.

6191
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:17,480
Stay away.

6192
03:12:18,660 --> 03:12:19,840
Stay back from the mist.

6193
03:12:19,880 --> 03:12:20,080
Oh my god.

6194
03:12:20,260 --> 03:12:20,900
Wait, what's happening?

6195
03:12:21,300 --> 03:12:22,480
Stay back from the mist.

6196
03:12:22,880 --> 03:12:23,580
Oh, there's a man!

6197
03:12:24,060 --> 03:12:24,920
Oh, there's a man.

6198
03:12:25,120 --> 03:12:25,700
Don't breathe the mist.

6199
03:12:25,700 --> 03:12:26,400
The man in the den.

6200
03:12:26,720 --> 03:12:27,640
Oh my god, I saw him too.

6201
03:12:27,980 --> 03:12:28,740
Don't breathe the mist.

6202
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:30,000
The mist, the mist.

6203
03:12:30,900 --> 03:12:32,220
Oh, oh, I'm gonna say nothing.

6204
03:12:32,960 --> 03:12:33,280
Really?

6205
03:12:33,980 --> 03:12:34,580
I'm gonna say nothing.

6206
03:12:34,580 --> 03:12:35,740
You coward, you coward.

6207
03:12:37,640 --> 03:12:38,560
Inside with us.

6208
03:12:38,780 --> 03:12:39,100
Now.

6209
03:12:40,360 --> 03:12:41,440
Please, just calm down.

6210
03:12:41,480 --> 03:12:42,500
Why did you say something?

6211
03:12:43,220 --> 03:12:44,560
Why did I make the decision?

6212
03:12:45,680 --> 03:12:46,640
It's in one of us.

6213
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:47,140
Isn't it?

6214
03:12:47,500 --> 03:12:48,560
We have to convince this on him.

6215
03:12:48,620 --> 03:12:49,040
It's in him.

6216
03:12:49,420 --> 03:12:50,520
We have to say it's in him.

6217
03:12:50,700 --> 03:12:51,220
Oh, yeah.

6218
03:12:51,340 --> 03:12:52,280
I'll say I haven't breathed...

6219
03:12:52,280 --> 03:12:52,700
I don't...

6220
03:12:52,700 --> 03:12:52,860
I don't know.

6221
03:12:52,860 --> 03:12:54,280
I haven't breathed any weird mist.

6222
03:12:54,740 --> 03:12:55,100
Please.

6223
03:12:55,220 --> 03:12:55,720
I promise.

6224
03:12:56,780 --> 03:12:57,940
My deceitful went up.

6225
03:12:58,140 --> 03:12:58,680
Oh, thank you.

6226
03:12:58,680 --> 03:12:59,600
Yeah, you breathed in the mist.

6227
03:12:59,760 --> 03:13:00,000
No.

6228
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:00,420
I'm gonna say no.

6229
03:13:00,580 --> 03:13:01,020
It's happening.

6230
03:13:01,580 --> 03:13:02,300
You breathed...

6231
03:13:02,300 --> 03:13:03,300
Yeah, Bradley, you breathed...

6232
03:13:03,300 --> 03:13:03,800
I can feel it.

6233
03:13:03,800 --> 03:13:04,460
You breathed in the mist.

6234
03:13:04,460 --> 03:13:04,780
No.

6235
03:13:04,940 --> 03:13:05,900
He's gonna shoot Brad.

6236
03:13:05,940 --> 03:13:06,520
Shoot Brad.

6237
03:13:06,620 --> 03:13:06,980
Shoot Brad.

6238
03:13:07,480 --> 03:13:08,300
There is no...

6239
03:13:10,180 --> 03:13:11,480
There was something back...

6240
03:13:11,480 --> 03:13:12,120
Oh, what are you doing?

6241
03:13:12,240 --> 03:13:13,080
There is no mist.

6242
03:13:14,600 --> 03:13:15,980
There was something back there.

6243
03:13:16,100 --> 03:13:16,360
Okay.

6244
03:13:16,380 --> 03:13:17,100
All right.

6245
03:13:17,140 --> 03:13:17,280
Look.

6246
03:13:17,520 --> 03:13:19,080
I think he's gonna shoot Brad.

6247
03:13:19,080 --> 03:13:19,560
Uh-oh.

6248
03:13:19,560 --> 03:13:20,600
He's gonna shoot Brad.

6249
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:21,680
Oh, you just killed...

6250
03:13:23,840 --> 03:13:24,280
See?

6251
03:13:25,220 --> 03:13:25,800
All right.

6252
03:13:25,840 --> 03:13:26,380
We won it.

6253
03:13:26,480 --> 03:13:27,440
Did you breathe it in?

6254
03:13:27,740 --> 03:13:28,180
No.

6255
03:13:28,480 --> 03:13:29,080
Say no.

6256
03:13:30,840 --> 03:13:31,900
We held our breath.

6257
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:32,340
Oh.

6258
03:13:32,340 --> 03:13:32,500
No.

6259
03:13:32,600 --> 03:13:33,000
Look.

6260
03:13:33,300 --> 03:13:34,340
We held our breath.

6261
03:13:34,420 --> 03:13:36,320
We did not breathe any of that stuff.

6262
03:13:38,360 --> 03:13:39,320
I fucked up.

6263
03:13:39,340 --> 03:13:40,100
I fucked up.

6264
03:13:40,140 --> 03:13:40,360
Brad's gonna die.

6265
03:13:40,360 --> 03:13:40,700
I think you...

6266
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:41,680
Brad is too...

6267
03:13:41,680 --> 03:13:42,060
I fucked up.

6268
03:13:42,700 --> 03:13:43,800
I fucked up.

6269
03:13:44,480 --> 03:13:44,920
I fucked up.

6270
03:13:44,920 --> 03:13:45,700
I fucked up.

6271
03:13:45,700 --> 03:13:45,960
I fucked up.

6272
03:13:45,960 --> 03:13:47,900
We've been down here for hours.

6273
03:13:48,880 --> 03:13:50,800
You've been holding your breath this whole time.

6274
03:13:50,920 --> 03:13:51,320
It's true.

6275
03:13:51,700 --> 03:13:52,840
You're holding your breath right now.

6276
03:13:53,460 --> 03:13:54,220
Uh-oh.

6277
03:13:55,020 --> 03:13:55,560
Uh-oh.

6278
03:13:56,260 --> 03:13:56,840
Uh-oh.

6279
03:13:56,960 --> 03:13:57,340
It's in me.

6280
03:13:57,560 --> 03:13:58,220
Uh-oh.

6281
03:13:58,300 --> 03:13:58,560
It's in me.

6282
03:13:58,560 --> 03:13:58,940
Wait.

6283
03:13:59,080 --> 03:13:59,360
You did it.

6284
03:13:59,380 --> 03:13:59,760
I did it.

6285
03:13:59,840 --> 03:14:00,220
We did it.

6286
03:14:00,760 --> 03:14:01,420
It's in me.

6287
03:14:01,460 --> 03:14:01,800
Isn't it?

6288
03:14:01,800 --> 03:14:02,480
We did it.

6289
03:14:03,300 --> 03:14:03,940
How do...

6290
03:14:03,940 --> 03:14:04,560
How do...

6291
03:14:06,540 --> 03:14:07,520
He's gonna shoot...

6292
03:14:07,520 --> 03:14:08,540
What if he shoots us first?

6293
03:14:09,500 --> 03:14:10,560
He's chasing me.

6294
03:14:10,680 --> 03:14:11,080
Okay.

6295
03:14:11,840 --> 03:14:12,660
Come on, man.

6296
03:14:13,180 --> 03:14:13,740
Come on.

6297
03:14:13,740 --> 03:14:14,200
Shoot yourself.

6298
03:14:14,460 --> 03:14:14,540
The mist.

6299
03:14:14,580 --> 03:14:15,000
The mist.

6300
03:14:15,320 --> 03:14:15,700
The mist.

6301
03:14:15,700 --> 03:14:15,800
The mist.

6302
03:14:15,800 --> 03:14:16,000
The mist.

6303
03:14:16,300 --> 03:14:16,700
Persona.

6304
03:14:17,480 --> 03:14:17,880
Persona.

6305
03:14:17,880 --> 03:14:19,680
What the hell would they grab this sword this draft?

6306
03:14:20,380 --> 03:14:20,780
Wait.

6307
03:14:20,840 --> 03:14:21,200
What are you doing?

6308
03:14:21,220 --> 03:14:21,480
What do you do?

6309
03:14:21,660 --> 03:14:22,360
You decide.

6310
03:14:23,340 --> 03:14:23,740
Stop.

6311
03:14:25,160 --> 03:14:25,960
Stop lying.

6312
03:14:28,720 --> 03:14:30,520
You can only see it in me, can't you?

6313
03:14:32,480 --> 03:14:33,600
What did you..

6314
03:14:33,600 --> 03:14:33,920
Come on.

6315
03:14:33,920 --> 03:14:34,340
Come on.

6316
03:14:34,340 --> 03:14:35,160
I didn't say anything.

6317
03:14:35,320 --> 03:14:36,400
Why are you making him stall?

6318
03:14:37,100 --> 03:14:37,500
Oh...

6319
03:14:37,500 --> 03:14:37,760
Oh...

6320
03:14:37,760 --> 03:14:38,940
Oh there it is.

6321
03:14:46,470 --> 03:14:47,270
Oh maybe.

6322
03:14:47,270 --> 03:14:47,390
Maybe?

6323
03:14:47,430 --> 03:14:47,650
Maybe?

6324
03:15:01,710 --> 03:15:02,770
We did it!

6325
03:15:02,910 --> 03:15:03,250
Let's go!

6326
03:15:03,390 --> 03:15:04,370
We killed another man!

6327
03:15:04,910 --> 03:15:05,930
We killed another man!

6328
03:15:07,470 --> 03:15:08,810
Murder is the option!

6329
03:15:10,530 --> 03:15:13,530
Wait, why don't you keep the gun?

6330
03:15:14,350 --> 03:15:15,110
Is it empty?

6331
03:15:16,830 --> 03:15:18,510
Someone's like, you could have saved him.

6332
03:15:18,630 --> 03:15:19,930
Wait, we're supposed to save him?

6333
03:15:19,930 --> 03:15:20,530
Oh.

6334
03:15:20,890 --> 03:15:21,370
Oh.

6335
03:15:23,130 --> 03:15:25,750
No, it wasn't our premonition!

6336
03:15:25,850 --> 03:15:26,630
It was our premonition!

6337
03:15:27,090 --> 03:15:28,910
I thought we were supposed to kill him!

6338
03:15:34,050 --> 03:15:35,410
Oh, I'm flished.

6339
03:15:35,430 --> 03:15:37,010
Oh, it's 4.44 AM.

6340
03:15:37,090 --> 03:15:37,670
How spooky.

6341
03:15:37,930 --> 03:15:39,730
Oh my god, so spooky.

6342
03:15:40,590 --> 03:15:42,450
Yeah, they took us hostage.

6343
03:15:42,550 --> 03:15:43,850
Why are we supposed to save him?

6344
03:15:43,850 --> 03:15:44,630
He's the bad guy!

6345
03:15:46,410 --> 03:15:47,950
Doesn't sound like my problem.

6346
03:15:48,230 --> 03:15:49,570
There might be some more gear down there.

6347
03:15:50,810 --> 03:15:51,990
Murderers of Medan!

6348
03:15:56,950 --> 03:15:59,430
We were the murderers all along!

6349
03:16:03,090 --> 03:16:04,990
Oh, they're going down.

6350
03:16:05,290 --> 03:16:05,510
Okay.

6351
03:16:08,670 --> 03:16:11,110
Why are we saving the kidnappers?

6352
03:16:12,210 --> 03:16:13,510
Oh my god!

6353
03:16:14,130 --> 03:16:15,170
I swear to god.

6354
03:16:15,530 --> 03:16:16,830
No, I'm Fliss.

6355
03:16:16,830 --> 03:16:17,270
I'm Fliss.

6356
03:16:17,490 --> 03:16:18,090
Okay.

6357
03:16:18,530 --> 03:16:19,550
I think it's all you.

6358
03:16:19,690 --> 03:16:20,010
I'm doing this then.

6359
03:16:20,210 --> 03:16:20,430
Yeah.

6360
03:16:21,470 --> 03:16:21,910
Okay.

6361
03:16:21,970 --> 03:16:22,550
Are you doing it right now?

6362
03:16:23,070 --> 03:16:23,770
Yes, I am.

6363
03:16:23,810 --> 03:16:24,050
Mess up.

6364
03:16:24,170 --> 03:16:24,330
Hey.

6365
03:16:25,170 --> 03:16:29,650
I had a good track record with this!

6366
03:16:30,310 --> 03:16:31,250
It's on you!

6367
03:16:31,970 --> 03:16:33,550
How do you mess this up?

6368
03:16:35,650 --> 03:16:37,130
It's too much pressure!

6369
03:16:38,110 --> 03:16:40,790
The moment I give you pressure, you do better!

6370
03:16:40,990 --> 03:16:43,490
I don't understand how that works with you!

6371
03:16:44,910 --> 03:16:48,070
When I stress you out, you actually mess it up!

6372
03:16:49,730 --> 03:16:50,330
Oh my god!

6373
03:16:50,390 --> 03:16:51,190
There's a man down there!

6374
03:16:51,270 --> 03:16:51,950
The man of Medan!

6375
03:16:52,730 --> 03:16:54,170
The murderers of Medan!

6376
03:16:54,230 --> 03:16:55,930
The murderers of Medan!

6377
03:16:57,150 --> 03:16:57,810
Come on!

6378
03:16:57,810 --> 03:16:58,270
Let's go!

6379
03:16:58,430 --> 03:16:59,070
Let's go!

6380
03:16:59,150 --> 03:17:00,270
Why can't I walk fast?

6381
03:17:00,670 --> 03:17:01,290
Come on!

6382
03:17:01,290 --> 03:17:02,010
Move, Fliss!

6383
03:17:02,090 --> 03:17:02,290
Move!

6384
03:17:02,950 --> 03:17:03,550
Move you!

6385
03:17:04,250 --> 03:17:04,970
I'm trying!

6386
03:17:05,050 --> 03:17:05,950
She's so slow!

6387
03:17:08,750 --> 03:17:11,490
Every time I pass it, it says, Mint failed it.

6388
03:17:11,670 --> 03:17:13,290
Even though you don't have to do it.

6389
03:17:13,410 --> 03:17:16,090
Even the game says you failed it.

6390
03:17:16,090 --> 03:17:17,970
What if it calls me out?

6391
03:17:18,070 --> 03:17:18,390
Oh!

6392
03:17:18,510 --> 03:17:19,070
You disappeared!

6393
03:17:19,170 --> 03:17:19,850
Over here!

6394
03:17:19,890 --> 03:17:20,330
Where did you go?

6395
03:17:20,710 --> 03:17:21,110
I'm here!

6396
03:17:21,590 --> 03:17:22,350
I'm heading over!

6397
03:17:22,370 --> 03:17:23,330
I'm slowly heading over!

6398
03:17:29,050 --> 03:17:30,550
Oh my god...

6399
03:17:31,050 --> 03:17:31,450
Hello?

6400
03:17:34,330 --> 03:17:35,550
Oh no, what's that?

6401
03:17:35,550 --> 03:17:36,150
Oh, he's coming over.

6402
03:17:36,350 --> 03:17:37,190
It doesn't matter.

6403
03:17:37,390 --> 03:17:38,970
We need that distributor cab.

6404
03:17:39,070 --> 03:17:39,770
Stop talking!

6405
03:17:40,110 --> 03:17:40,110
Here!

6406
03:17:40,730 --> 03:17:41,630
He had to have come this way.

6407
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:43,030
He's so loud, Alex!

6408
03:17:43,370 --> 03:17:43,690
I know!

6409
03:17:43,770 --> 03:17:44,410
He's like, Hey!

6410
03:17:44,530 --> 03:17:45,250
It's over here!

6411
03:17:45,250 --> 03:17:45,430
Hey!

6412
03:17:45,630 --> 03:17:46,290
It's here!

6413
03:17:49,370 --> 03:17:50,910
This is not the way that we win.

6414
03:17:51,330 --> 03:17:51,690
How...

6415
03:17:52,390 --> 03:17:53,470
How are they gonna find us?

6416
03:17:53,730 --> 03:17:54,090
Oh!

6417
03:17:54,390 --> 03:17:55,230
Was that your hand?

6418
03:17:55,830 --> 03:17:56,570
I don't know.

6419
03:17:56,750 --> 03:17:57,330
I sure hope so.

6420
03:17:57,510 --> 03:17:58,310
I sure hope so, too.

6421
03:17:59,290 --> 03:18:00,510
I hope so, too.

6422
03:18:01,870 --> 03:18:02,670
Oh, uh-oh.

6423
03:18:03,090 --> 03:18:04,270
Wait, I don't think we can go this way.

6424
03:18:04,290 --> 03:18:05,470
How is there still more?

6425
03:18:06,450 --> 03:18:07,010
Wait, who's that?

6426
03:18:07,030 --> 03:18:07,610
Oh, he is!

6427
03:18:08,810 --> 03:18:09,170
Oh!

6428
03:18:10,590 --> 03:18:11,230
It's just...

6429
03:18:11,230 --> 03:18:11,710
Oh, he's us!

6430
03:18:12,090 --> 03:18:12,190
Oh!

6431
03:18:13,370 --> 03:18:14,830
I think we can make it across.

6432
03:18:16,330 --> 03:18:16,690
What?

6433
03:18:18,130 --> 03:18:18,490
Jump.

6434
03:18:19,170 --> 03:18:20,270
Are we actually gonna do it?

6435
03:18:21,030 --> 03:18:21,570
Here we go.

6436
03:18:21,590 --> 03:18:22,930
This is a lot deeper than I expected.

6437
03:18:23,230 --> 03:18:23,770
Yeah, it's pretty...

6438
03:18:24,330 --> 03:18:24,870
It's fine.

6439
03:18:25,310 --> 03:18:26,550
Get ready for the quick time.

6440
03:18:28,410 --> 03:18:29,170
What's the first one?

6441
03:18:33,970 --> 03:18:34,690
Oh, wait!

6442
03:18:37,570 --> 03:18:38,830
I don't think I had to do it!

6443
03:18:39,710 --> 03:18:40,370
The gases!

6444
03:18:40,490 --> 03:18:40,810
Oh, no!

6445
03:18:40,830 --> 03:18:41,270
The gases!

6446
03:18:41,370 --> 03:18:43,390
The gases are, like, really bad here.

6447
03:18:43,390 --> 03:18:44,250
He dropped the hammer!

6448
03:18:44,450 --> 03:18:44,810
Oh, no!

6449
03:18:46,450 --> 03:18:47,170
Wait, what is...

6450
03:18:47,170 --> 03:18:48,410
Oh, what is it zooming on?

6451
03:18:48,570 --> 03:18:49,070
The hammer?

6452
03:18:49,210 --> 03:18:49,730
The hammer!

6453
03:18:49,810 --> 03:18:50,110
The hammer!

6454
03:18:50,370 --> 03:18:50,410
Yeah.

6455
03:18:51,170 --> 03:18:51,850
We'll get it.

6456
03:18:51,930 --> 03:18:52,550
We'll grab that.

6457
03:18:53,150 --> 03:18:53,870
I swear.

6458
03:18:53,950 --> 03:18:56,910
Do not use the hammer against me!

6459
03:18:59,210 --> 03:19:00,610
Oh, is he getting a heart attack?

6460
03:19:00,690 --> 03:19:01,950
Oh, he's gonna get scared to death!

6461
03:19:02,090 --> 03:19:02,230
Yeah!

6462
03:19:02,450 --> 03:19:03,770
He's getting scared to death now!

6463
03:19:03,970 --> 03:19:04,510
We have to do this...

6464
03:19:04,510 --> 03:19:05,550
I think we have to do this fast.

6465
03:19:06,050 --> 03:19:06,590
Uh-oh.

6466
03:19:06,650 --> 03:19:07,590
But we're gonna get hard...

6467
03:19:07,590 --> 03:19:07,830
Yeah!

6468
03:19:08,670 --> 03:19:09,650
This is the moment.

6469
03:19:09,890 --> 03:19:10,130
I'm not gonna make this jump, Alex.

6470
03:19:10,550 --> 03:19:11,870
Are you fucking kidding me?

6471
03:19:12,970 --> 03:19:14,310
Get the fucking...

6472
03:19:14,310 --> 03:19:14,790
Oh, my God!

6473
03:19:14,810 --> 03:19:16,830
I have to make sure I don't get a heart attack!

6474
03:19:18,990 --> 03:19:20,050
I chickened out!

6475
03:19:20,290 --> 03:19:20,750
Let's go!

6476
03:19:20,950 --> 03:19:22,330
Are you fucking...

6477
03:19:22,330 --> 03:19:22,830
Alright!

6478
03:19:22,870 --> 03:19:23,630
I chickened out!

6479
03:19:23,650 --> 03:19:25,650
I gotta make sure I don't get a heart attack.

6480
03:19:25,770 --> 03:19:26,010
I guess.

6481
03:19:26,010 --> 03:19:26,450
Oh, I'm outside.

6482
03:19:26,970 --> 03:19:28,170
Breathing that fresh air.

6483
03:19:29,010 --> 03:19:31,170
I can't believe it!

6484
03:19:31,510 --> 03:19:33,310
Is this actual bullshit?

6485
03:19:33,310 --> 03:19:33,590
Oh, yeah.

6486
03:19:33,590 --> 03:19:35,030
I'm fucking going as fast as I can!

6487
03:19:35,350 --> 03:19:36,090
I'm going, too!

6488
03:19:36,150 --> 03:19:36,870
I'm pressing LB!

6489
03:19:37,010 --> 03:19:37,290
LB!

6490
03:19:37,810 --> 03:19:38,610
Is this it here?

6491
03:19:39,590 --> 03:19:40,670
Oh, I can't see anything.

6492
03:19:40,870 --> 03:19:41,230
Oh, my God.

6493
03:19:41,250 --> 03:19:41,770
This is pitch black.

6494
03:19:41,810 --> 03:19:42,290
Oh, my God.

6495
03:19:42,410 --> 03:19:43,210
I'm going to the door.

6496
03:19:43,270 --> 03:19:43,630
It's fine.

6497
03:19:43,950 --> 03:19:44,410
Wait, what's...

6498
03:19:44,410 --> 03:19:44,610
Who's that?

6499
03:19:44,810 --> 03:19:45,190
Who's that down there?

6500
03:19:46,370 --> 03:19:47,170
Oh, my God.

6501
03:19:48,030 --> 03:19:48,390
Hold on.

6502
03:19:48,470 --> 03:19:48,910
Hold on.

6503
03:19:48,950 --> 03:19:49,830
I think those are bodies.

6504
03:19:50,010 --> 03:19:50,170
Wait.

6505
03:19:50,210 --> 03:19:50,850
That's a guy right there.

6506
03:19:51,590 --> 03:19:51,950
Oh!

6507
03:19:53,430 --> 03:19:54,150
Of course.

6508
03:19:54,170 --> 03:19:55,350
But they will shrink your movement.

6509
03:19:55,830 --> 03:19:56,890
Notaries indicate that...

6510
03:19:56,890 --> 03:19:57,270
I'm coming.

6511
03:19:57,430 --> 03:19:58,510
...M5 platoons have gone missing.

6512
03:19:58,790 --> 03:19:59,050
What?

6513
03:19:59,350 --> 03:19:59,810
I'm coming.

6514
03:20:00,730 --> 03:20:01,270
I'm coming.

6515
03:20:01,290 --> 03:20:01,550
Hold on.

6516
03:20:01,610 --> 03:20:02,170
Are there any notes?

6517
03:20:02,250 --> 03:20:03,310
Oh, there's a lot of stuff in here.

6518
03:20:03,710 --> 03:20:04,810
There's a lot of stuff in here.

6519
03:20:04,870 --> 03:20:05,090
Hold on.

6520
03:20:05,790 --> 03:20:08,270
I'm trying to figure it out where he is.

6521
03:20:09,250 --> 03:20:09,890
He's dead.

6522
03:20:09,990 --> 03:20:10,510
He's dead.

6523
03:20:10,650 --> 03:20:11,190
It's fine.

6524
03:20:12,990 --> 03:20:13,710
Diplomat immunity.

6525
03:20:14,130 --> 03:20:14,490
Oh, no.

6526
03:20:14,490 --> 03:20:14,790
Oh, no.

6527
03:20:14,810 --> 03:20:15,770
Oh, no.

6528
03:20:17,610 --> 03:20:18,530
The rats.

6529
03:20:18,870 --> 03:20:20,230
Water purification.

6530
03:20:21,930 --> 03:20:24,610
There's rats eating the dead body.

6531
03:20:24,790 --> 03:20:25,090
Already?

6532
03:20:25,330 --> 03:20:27,370
Why do you get to go outside?

6533
03:20:27,710 --> 03:20:28,610
I'm reading.

6534
03:20:28,710 --> 03:20:29,810
I'm exploring.

6535
03:20:29,950 --> 03:20:30,850
It's kind of nice.

6536
03:20:31,310 --> 03:20:32,050
Oh, my God.

6537
03:20:32,130 --> 03:20:33,250
I saw a dead body.

6538
03:20:33,350 --> 03:20:34,410
He was just chilling though.

6539
03:20:34,830 --> 03:20:36,250
Manifest a personal effects.

6540
03:20:37,190 --> 03:20:38,130
Oh, no.

6541
03:20:39,210 --> 03:20:40,210
The dog died.

6542
03:20:40,270 --> 03:20:41,190
Oh, these are the guys that died.

6543
03:20:42,010 --> 03:20:42,830
Oh, no.

6544
03:20:43,650 --> 03:20:44,210
Oops.

6545
03:20:44,510 --> 03:20:44,790
Oh, no.

6546
03:20:51,150 --> 03:20:53,210
I'm trying to figure it out.

6547
03:20:53,210 --> 03:20:53,370
I see the car.

6548
03:20:53,530 --> 03:20:54,210
Okay.

6549
03:20:54,350 --> 03:20:56,110
Oh, no.

6550
03:20:56,430 --> 03:20:57,030
Oh, no.

6551
03:20:57,170 --> 03:20:58,730
Oh, there is a rat.

6552
03:20:59,130 --> 03:20:59,230
I gotta go.

6553
03:20:59,230 --> 03:20:59,850
Oh, no.

6554
03:20:59,850 --> 03:21:01,930
Oh, no.

6555
03:21:01,930 --> 03:21:03,250
Oh, no.

6556
03:21:03,410 --> 03:21:04,270
It's the rat.

6557
03:21:04,590 --> 03:21:04,930
I'm trying to figure it out.

6558
03:21:06,330 --> 03:21:07,010
No.

6559
03:21:07,410 --> 03:21:08,570
I'm going to close this one.

6560
03:21:08,730 --> 03:21:09,410
Good.

6561
03:21:14,770 --> 03:21:14,990
I'm freaking out!

6562
03:21:14,990 --> 03:21:16,470
I'm freaking out over the rats!

6563
03:21:16,690 --> 03:21:18,150
Oh, I see you freaking out over the rats!

6564
03:21:18,310 --> 03:21:18,710
Chill out!

6565
03:21:19,990 --> 03:21:20,670
What the hell?

6566
03:21:20,750 --> 03:21:21,410
What is going on?

6567
03:21:21,410 --> 03:21:21,910
What the fuck was that?

6568
03:21:21,930 --> 03:21:22,710
What's going on?

6569
03:21:23,090 --> 03:21:23,450
What?

6570
03:21:28,110 --> 03:21:29,170
Decide well, I guess.

6571
03:21:30,190 --> 03:21:30,550
What?

6572
03:21:31,650 --> 03:21:32,490
Who are you?

6573
03:21:34,030 --> 03:21:34,710
Who are you?

6574
03:21:35,650 --> 03:21:36,090
That's me!

6575
03:21:36,170 --> 03:21:36,370
That's me!

6576
03:21:36,430 --> 03:21:36,730
That's me!

6577
03:21:36,790 --> 03:21:37,430
Don't do anything!

6578
03:21:37,590 --> 03:21:37,770
That's me!

6579
03:21:37,950 --> 03:21:40,150
Yeah, it's me.

6580
03:21:40,730 --> 03:21:41,090
Idiot.

6581
03:21:41,510 --> 03:21:42,030
It's me!

6582
03:21:42,150 --> 03:21:44,490
Is that you?

6583
03:21:45,670 --> 03:21:46,310
That's me!

6584
03:21:47,350 --> 03:21:48,250
Don't do anything!

6585
03:21:48,850 --> 03:21:49,510
It's me!

6586
03:21:50,050 --> 03:21:50,730
Uh oh.

6587
03:21:50,950 --> 03:21:52,130
I think Fliss might die.

6588
03:21:52,570 --> 03:21:53,930
You're the one who's gonna kill.

6589
03:21:56,190 --> 03:21:58,350
The game is bugging out, man.

6590
03:21:58,590 --> 03:21:58,810
What?

6591
03:21:58,890 --> 03:21:59,670
I'm dying?

6592
03:22:00,370 --> 03:22:01,610
Why are you dying?

6593
03:22:03,070 --> 03:22:03,950
What's going on?

6594
03:22:04,670 --> 03:22:05,550
The rats!

6595
03:22:05,950 --> 03:22:07,330
There are no rats!

6596
03:22:08,050 --> 03:22:08,510
The rats!

6597
03:22:08,690 --> 03:22:09,470
Don't kill me!

6598
03:22:09,590 --> 03:22:10,590
Don't kill me!

6599
03:22:12,030 --> 03:22:12,910
Don't you dare!

6600
03:22:15,090 --> 03:22:16,150
Come on, Alex.

6601
03:22:16,150 --> 03:22:17,690
I'm gonna put you out of your misery, Alex.

6602
03:22:18,030 --> 03:22:19,510
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

6603
03:22:20,650 --> 03:22:21,970
I'm gonna put you out of your misery.

6604
03:22:23,570 --> 03:22:24,830
Don't do anything to me!

6605
03:22:25,390 --> 03:22:26,210
Don't do anything to me!

6606
03:22:26,310 --> 03:22:26,610
Stop!

6607
03:22:28,550 --> 03:22:28,990
Stop!

6608
03:22:29,850 --> 03:22:30,290
Stop!

6609
03:22:36,830 --> 03:22:37,430
It's okay.

6610
03:22:38,810 --> 03:22:41,490
There were no rats the whole time!

6611
03:22:41,770 --> 03:22:42,290
There were no rats!

6612
03:22:44,050 --> 03:22:45,050
Oh my god.

6613
03:22:45,090 --> 03:22:45,770
The game is...

6614
03:22:45,770 --> 03:22:47,490
The game is bugging out right now.

6615
03:22:49,110 --> 03:22:51,570
It's always you that's about to kill me.

6616
03:22:51,670 --> 03:22:52,910
I swear to god.

6617
03:22:52,910 --> 03:22:53,390
I know!

6618
03:22:53,390 --> 03:22:54,850
You were the one holding the knife!

6619
03:22:54,930 --> 03:22:55,570
What are you talking about?

6620
03:22:57,710 --> 03:22:59,610
You were a monster on my screen.

6621
03:22:59,750 --> 03:23:01,070
You were a monster!

6622
03:23:01,510 --> 03:23:02,710
What are you talking about?

6623
03:23:03,970 --> 03:23:05,570
You had two heads!

6624
03:23:08,550 --> 03:23:12,590
Well, you looked like you were getting eaten by rats, but you weren't actually...

6625
03:23:12,590 --> 03:23:13,510
Oh, what the hell?

6626
03:23:13,630 --> 03:23:15,570
Where the fuck did he come from?

6627
03:23:15,570 --> 03:23:16,190
Why are you there?

6628
03:23:16,630 --> 03:23:18,050
No way.

6629
03:23:18,150 --> 03:23:19,750
Did we survive everybody?

6630
03:23:20,170 --> 03:23:22,030
Did we save everybody?

6631
03:23:23,030 --> 03:23:24,050
Did we?

6632
03:23:24,050 --> 03:23:24,990
Did we?

6633
03:23:26,470 --> 03:23:27,710
Oh my god!

6634
03:23:28,290 --> 03:23:29,590
No way!

6635
03:23:29,930 --> 03:23:30,770
Oh my god!

6636
03:23:30,790 --> 03:23:31,550
We're back on the boat!

6637
03:23:31,930 --> 03:23:32,850
No way!

6638
03:23:33,150 --> 03:23:35,890
We saved everybody!

6639
03:23:36,670 --> 03:23:38,510
Oh my god!

6640
03:23:38,510 --> 03:23:39,810
Let's try it!

6641
03:23:43,150 --> 03:23:44,110
Even Conrad!

6642
03:23:44,510 --> 03:23:45,850
Even Conrad!

6643
03:23:46,730 --> 03:23:48,730
That's something crazy!

6644
03:23:50,770 --> 03:23:51,730
Holy shit!

6645
03:23:51,850 --> 03:23:53,950
Are we just gonna forget that everything happened?

6646
03:23:53,990 --> 03:23:56,630
We're just gonna leave this ship and just forget anything ever happened?

6647
03:23:57,570 --> 03:23:58,950
What about Conrad?

6648
03:23:59,270 --> 03:24:01,730
I thought Conrad was gonna come back for us.

6649
03:24:01,790 --> 03:24:02,050
I know!

6650
03:24:02,070 --> 03:24:02,870
I thought so too!

6651
03:24:03,050 --> 03:24:04,250
That fucking bastard!

6652
03:24:04,290 --> 03:24:05,170
He just dipped!

6653
03:24:06,390 --> 03:24:07,710
Oh my god!

6654
03:24:08,510 --> 03:24:09,150
No way!

6655
03:24:09,230 --> 03:24:09,990
That actually worked!

6656
03:24:10,090 --> 03:24:10,590
Oh there he is!

6657
03:24:11,790 --> 03:24:12,830
There's Conrad!

6658
03:24:14,730 --> 03:24:17,330
No way!

6659
03:24:17,410 --> 03:24:18,090
He came back!

6660
03:24:18,270 --> 03:24:19,550
He came back!

6661
03:24:19,570 --> 03:24:20,570
He has a gun!

6662
03:24:21,710 --> 03:24:22,890
He's gonna get on the ship!

6663
03:24:22,990 --> 03:24:24,810
I think we killed Conrad!

6664
03:24:25,430 --> 03:24:27,090
I think we killed Conrad!

6665
03:24:27,830 --> 03:24:30,030
They're gonna kill Conrad in the end!

6666
03:24:36,370 --> 03:24:36,890
Oh

6667
03:24:51,990 --> 03:24:52,510
shit!

6668
03:24:52,710 --> 03:24:53,090
Oh shit!

6669
03:24:55,170 --> 03:24:56,490
What the hell is this place?

6670
03:24:56,510 --> 03:24:57,050
Oh it's inviting him in!

6671
03:24:58,810 --> 03:25:00,070
Oh there he goes!

6672
03:25:00,170 --> 03:25:00,570
Oh no!

6673
03:25:00,630 --> 03:25:01,290
There he goes in!

6674
03:25:01,470 --> 03:25:01,850
Oh my god!

6675
03:25:01,870 --> 03:25:02,150
Conrad!

6676
03:25:02,990 --> 03:25:04,970
You're gonna die Conrad!

6677
03:25:05,630 --> 03:25:06,270
Conrad no!

6678
03:25:08,830 --> 03:25:09,670
Is it abandoned?

6679
03:25:09,870 --> 03:25:10,910
Do we get a choice?

6680
03:25:11,330 --> 03:25:11,770
No.

6681
03:25:11,990 --> 03:25:12,790
Just let him die.

6682
03:25:13,130 --> 03:25:14,150
No way!

6683
03:25:14,370 --> 03:25:15,390
We saved him!

6684
03:25:15,730 --> 03:25:18,330
Just for him to go back to the ship!

6685
03:25:18,450 --> 03:25:20,010
He has his airpods on!

6686
03:25:22,690 --> 03:25:24,290
Where is the ghost guard?

6687
03:25:24,290 --> 03:25:25,470
He just got up on the ship!

6688
03:25:25,550 --> 03:25:27,110
Where did he get in here?

6689
03:25:28,370 --> 03:25:29,450
Oh my god!

6690
03:25:29,830 --> 03:25:30,910
The sequel?

6691
03:25:31,330 --> 03:25:33,790
The sequel is Man of Conrad!

6692
03:25:37,950 --> 03:25:43,710
He was trying to help us to get help but he doesn't know anything about boats or sailing.

6693
03:25:44,030 --> 03:25:45,890
Oh it's like the Until Dawn ending!

6694
03:25:46,230 --> 03:25:46,750
Yeah!

6695
03:25:47,410 --> 03:25:49,070
Or they do the interviews and stuff.

6696
03:25:50,850 --> 03:25:51,370
Oh!

6697
03:25:54,290 --> 03:25:56,570
It's just her being sad about Conrad!

6698
03:25:56,970 --> 03:25:58,030
That's it!

6699
03:25:58,910 --> 03:25:59,910
That's it!

6700
03:25:59,950 --> 03:26:00,390
Conrad!

6701
03:26:01,230 --> 03:26:03,310
He's just chilling!

6702
03:26:08,030 --> 03:26:09,370
No way!

6703
03:26:09,390 --> 03:26:10,250
That's the ending!

6704
03:26:10,950 --> 03:26:12,730
No fucking way!

6705
03:26:12,890 --> 03:26:14,510
We're like where's Conrad?

6706
03:26:16,140 --> 03:26:17,970
Technically we saved everybody!

6707
03:26:18,350 --> 03:26:19,270
No way!

6708
03:26:19,310 --> 03:26:20,030
That's the ending!

6709
03:26:20,970 --> 03:26:22,370
Oh my god!

6710
03:26:22,550 --> 03:26:23,150
Oh my god!

6711
03:26:24,290 --> 03:26:25,290
What is he gonna say?

6712
03:26:25,310 --> 03:26:26,470
Is he just gonna stare at us?

6713
03:26:26,670 --> 03:26:26,970
Come on!

6714
03:26:27,990 --> 03:26:28,550
Congratulations!

6715
03:26:29,830 --> 03:26:32,330
All your charges are still breathing.

6716
03:26:32,570 --> 03:26:33,570
And that's something.

6717
03:26:33,830 --> 03:26:36,050
That's really impressive for us I think.

6718
03:26:36,290 --> 03:26:36,650
Yeah!

6719
03:26:36,670 --> 03:26:38,030
Well it really is!

6720
03:26:38,250 --> 03:26:40,990
Things became a little intense but Alex kept his nerve.

6721
03:26:41,390 --> 03:26:43,630
We were not trying to save people!

6722
03:26:46,110 --> 03:26:48,570
It's all about decisions, isn't it?

6723
03:26:48,890 --> 03:26:50,450
Decisions made in a hurry.

6724
03:26:50,570 --> 03:26:51,430
In a panic.

6725
03:26:51,710 --> 03:26:53,670
Made with the heart instead of the head.

6726
03:26:54,290 --> 03:26:55,210
Or vice versa.

6727
03:26:56,290 --> 03:27:00,730
Sometimes those decisions take a long time to have repercussions.

6728
03:27:01,510 --> 03:27:03,830
But there are repercussions.

6729
03:27:04,630 --> 03:27:06,290
There are always repercussions.

6730
03:27:07,030 --> 03:27:08,450
Yeah, Conrad's dead now.

6731
03:27:08,750 --> 03:27:09,790
We don't know that!

6732
03:27:10,030 --> 03:27:10,950
We don't know that!

6733
03:27:11,070 --> 03:27:11,870
There's no proof!

6734
03:27:12,330 --> 03:27:13,210
I think so!

6735
03:27:14,610 --> 03:27:15,610
I think he's dead!

6736
03:27:16,050 --> 03:27:17,570
Did we get the good ending?

6737
03:27:18,210 --> 03:27:20,030
The boat literally invited him in.

6738
03:27:20,110 --> 03:27:20,610
Until we meet again.

6739
03:27:21,070 --> 03:27:22,470
Maybe in Little Hope.

6740
03:27:24,930 --> 03:27:25,370
Oh!

6741
03:27:25,870 --> 03:27:26,970
But be certain.

6742
03:27:27,610 --> 03:27:28,850
We will meet again.

6743
03:27:29,390 --> 03:27:29,830
Whoa!

6744
03:27:31,930 --> 03:27:32,370
Inevitable.

6745
03:27:35,270 --> 03:27:36,650
Apparently there's a DLC.

6746
03:27:39,790 --> 03:27:42,410
I don't know if that guy was baiting us.

6747
03:27:42,610 --> 03:27:43,270
I'm skipping.

6748
03:27:43,510 --> 03:27:44,190
I'm skipping to the end.

6749
03:27:44,210 --> 03:27:44,530
Are you skipping?

6750
03:27:44,690 --> 03:27:45,530
Yeah, skip to the end.

6751
03:27:51,550 --> 03:27:53,070
There's DLC for real?

6752
03:27:54,470 --> 03:27:55,630
Oh, that was a joke.

6753
03:27:55,730 --> 03:27:55,950
Okay.

6754
03:27:56,750 --> 03:27:57,930
Are they vibrating?

6755
03:27:58,910 --> 03:28:00,130
What's going on?

6756
03:28:03,070 --> 03:28:04,270
Are we getting a heart attack?

6757
03:28:04,570 --> 03:28:05,490
Whoa, they're vibrating?

6758
03:28:05,970 --> 03:28:08,270
Whoa, what's going on?

6759
03:28:08,550 --> 03:28:09,350
Is it because of the beer?

6760
03:28:10,230 --> 03:28:11,250
Is it the beer?

6761
03:28:12,410 --> 03:28:13,370
The decompression!

6762
03:28:13,510 --> 03:28:14,610
The decompression!

6763
03:28:17,650 --> 03:28:19,270
I swear to God!

6764
03:28:19,490 --> 03:28:21,350
You killed him because of the decompression!

6765
03:28:21,350 --> 03:28:23,090
Oh, my God!

6766
03:28:23,110 --> 03:28:24,550
He got into the beer!

6767
03:28:24,670 --> 03:28:26,190
She's shaking a lot!

6768
03:28:26,570 --> 03:28:27,090
Shit!

6769
03:28:27,090 --> 03:28:27,410
Shit!

6770
03:28:27,510 --> 03:28:28,870
This is decompression sickness!

6771
03:28:29,210 --> 03:28:30,510
We came out too fast!

6772
03:28:30,530 --> 03:28:31,370
Oh, my God!

6773
03:28:33,180 --> 03:28:34,190
Get out of here!

6774
03:28:34,190 --> 03:28:35,010
Come on!

6775
03:28:35,010 --> 03:28:36,170
Come on, Dee!

6776
03:28:37,010 --> 03:28:39,850
Why are they vibrating so bad?

6777
03:28:41,630 --> 03:28:42,710
Oh, my God!

6778
03:28:42,710 --> 03:28:44,470
Oh, my God!

6779
03:28:45,310 --> 03:28:46,410
Oh, my God!

6780
03:28:46,410 --> 03:28:48,790
We almost saved everybody!

6781
03:28:48,850 --> 03:28:51,050
We almost saved everybody!

6782
03:28:51,050 --> 03:28:52,450
We went through the credits!

6783
03:28:53,210 --> 03:28:55,170
Oh, my God!

6784
03:28:55,410 --> 03:28:56,750
I can't believe it!

6785
03:28:56,770 --> 03:28:58,570
Donkey, it was beer o'clock!

6786
03:28:58,630 --> 03:28:59,130
Please!

6787
03:29:01,150 --> 03:29:02,910
Beer o'clock?

6788
03:29:03,110 --> 03:29:06,650
Fucking beer o'clock!

6789
03:29:06,710 --> 03:29:07,130
Oh, my God!

6790
03:29:07,570 --> 03:29:10,330
We almost had a perfect run!

6791
03:29:10,590 --> 03:29:13,150
I can't have this!

6792
03:29:13,150 --> 03:29:15,230
I can't have this!

6793
03:29:15,390 --> 03:29:16,430
I can't have this!

6794
03:29:16,430 --> 03:29:17,910
I can't have this!

6795
03:29:17,910 --> 03:29:20,950
Oh, my God!

6796
03:29:20,950 --> 03:29:22,530
Fucking beer o'clock!

6797
03:29:22,530 --> 03:29:23,730
You have to understand!

6798
03:29:29,730 --> 03:29:32,430
Yeah, it was after the credits, so it doesn't count!

6799
03:29:32,630 --> 03:29:34,230
Yes, it doesn't count, guys!

6800
03:29:34,230 --> 03:29:35,190
It doesn't count, guys!

6801
03:29:35,210 --> 03:29:37,490
It was after the credits!

6802
03:29:39,790 --> 03:29:41,290
It doesn't count!

6803
03:29:44,710 --> 03:29:48,250
What happens after the credits is not our fault!

6804
03:29:48,870 --> 03:29:48,890
Oh, my God!

6805
03:29:50,970 --> 03:29:53,890
I can't believe it!

6806
03:29:56,610 --> 03:29:58,570
Oh, my God!

6807
03:29:58,670 --> 03:30:01,270
She died from beer o'clock!

6808
03:30:02,610 --> 03:30:05,270
After everything we've been through!

6809
03:30:05,450 --> 03:30:07,890
Fucking beer o'clock got us!

6810
03:30:08,170 --> 03:30:10,210
Oh, my God!

6811
03:30:10,890 --> 03:30:12,870
Holy shit!

6812
03:30:13,530 --> 03:30:17,230
You know, I'm surprised, like, everybody lived.

6813
03:30:17,350 --> 03:30:19,050
I'm surprised, too!

6814
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:20,270
Oh, my God!

6815
03:30:20,950 --> 03:30:22,070
That's right!

6816
03:30:22,250 --> 03:30:23,310
We're special!

6817
03:30:23,530 --> 03:30:26,630
No other VTuber plays the game like us!

6818
03:30:27,190 --> 03:30:31,330
We stumbled our way into victory!

6819
03:30:31,850 --> 03:30:32,230
We stumbled our way into victory!

6820
03:30:32,230 --> 03:30:36,870
You can guarantee an original experience here on our channel!

6821
03:30:39,450 --> 03:30:41,050
Beers of Medan!

6822
03:30:41,390 --> 03:30:45,710
I can't believe beer o'clock!

6823
03:30:45,850 --> 03:30:48,210
Are you fucking kidding me?

6824
03:30:54,030 --> 03:30:56,390
Why did the decompression take so long?

6825
03:30:56,710 --> 03:31:01,110
He said it was like a couple hours, or maybe a couple minutes.

6826
03:31:01,250 --> 03:31:01,870
Who knows?

6827
03:31:09,950 --> 03:31:11,030
That was good.

6828
03:31:11,310 --> 03:31:11,950
That was good.

6829
03:31:12,090 --> 03:31:12,770
Did you like the game?

6830
03:31:12,850 --> 03:31:13,150
That was good.

6831
03:31:13,290 --> 03:31:13,930
That was fun.

6832
03:31:14,230 --> 03:31:14,930
That was really fun.

6833
03:31:14,950 --> 03:31:17,390
We should do the sequel to this next time.

6834
03:31:17,550 --> 03:31:20,130
Is the sequel the same where we have to play two different characters?

6835
03:31:20,130 --> 03:31:20,690
I think so.

6836
03:31:20,690 --> 03:31:23,850
I heard Little Hope's not as good, though.

6837
03:31:24,090 --> 03:31:27,650
But I think all of these are all kind of like kusuge a little bit.

6838
03:31:31,290 --> 03:31:33,370
It's not the game, you guys.

6839
03:31:33,450 --> 03:31:34,530
It's who plays the game.

6840
03:31:34,910 --> 03:31:37,030
Yeah, it's who plays the game, guys.

6841
03:31:37,630 --> 03:31:38,690
Oh, my God.

6842
03:31:38,930 --> 03:31:41,870
As they say, nobody died, okay?

6843
03:31:42,690 --> 03:31:46,370
Anything that happens after the credits is not our fault.

6844
03:31:46,630 --> 03:31:47,230
Yes, yes.

6845
03:31:47,230 --> 03:31:49,510
Anything that happens is not our fault.

6846
03:31:49,810 --> 03:31:50,010
Yeah.

6847
03:31:50,230 --> 03:31:52,050
It might not be beer o'clock.

6848
03:31:52,310 --> 03:31:53,990
It could have been something she felt.

6849
03:31:56,790 --> 03:31:58,470
No one important died.

6850
03:31:59,010 --> 03:32:00,670
That's true, that's true.

6851
03:32:01,250 --> 03:32:02,090
Like, guys, Conrad's alive.

6852
03:32:02,090 --> 03:32:04,330
We probably saved Alex, you know?

6853
03:32:04,550 --> 03:32:05,750
Is Conrad alive?

6854
03:32:05,910 --> 03:32:06,530
I don't know.

6855
03:32:06,530 --> 03:32:07,950
Yeah, Conrad's alive, guys.

6856
03:32:08,670 --> 03:32:09,370
Conrad's alive.

6857
03:32:10,430 --> 03:32:14,090
Like how some people are like, you were supposed to save that one kidnapper.

6858
03:32:14,250 --> 03:32:15,970
But, like, he kidnapped us.

6859
03:32:17,350 --> 03:32:18,410
He's a pirate.

6860
03:32:18,870 --> 03:32:20,590
Yeah, self-defense.

6861
03:32:21,250 --> 03:32:23,770
Yeah, it was either us or him.

6862
03:32:23,990 --> 03:32:24,370
Yeah.

6863
03:32:25,150 --> 03:32:25,710
Yeah.

6864
03:32:26,110 --> 03:32:30,010
Someone was like, it's a hallucination, she's alive.

6865
03:32:32,070 --> 03:32:37,150
She's still on the trip, or the ship, she's like, Conrad, I waited for you.

6866
03:32:38,030 --> 03:32:40,710
It was like time of death beer o'clock.

6867
03:32:43,790 --> 03:32:48,290
God, I didn't think that that would be...

6868
03:32:49,170 --> 03:32:50,630
I didn't think actions had consequences.

6869
03:32:51,790 --> 03:32:52,350
No.

6870
03:32:52,810 --> 03:32:58,730
After the doctor boyfriend was like, maybe you shouldn't drink the beer.

6871
03:32:59,870 --> 03:33:02,810
People are saying, don't do little hope that it's actually bad.

6872
03:33:03,090 --> 03:33:04,090
Oh, is it actually bad?

6873
03:33:04,950 --> 03:33:07,890
Wait, how many games are in the anthology?

6874
03:33:08,150 --> 03:33:09,890
There's House of Ashes, apparently.

6875
03:33:10,250 --> 03:33:11,290
Is House of Ashes good?

6876
03:33:11,650 --> 03:33:14,490
Conrad survived up to the credits, therefore it doesn't matter.

6877
03:33:14,590 --> 03:33:15,190
So true!

6878
03:33:16,730 --> 03:33:17,630
So true.

6879
03:33:18,050 --> 03:33:20,630
I would very hard on those quick time events.

6880
03:33:25,650 --> 03:33:27,190
House of Ashes is good.

6881
03:33:27,410 --> 03:33:28,010
Oh, okay.

6882
03:33:28,330 --> 03:33:29,990
We'll do House of Ashes next.

6883
03:33:30,410 --> 03:33:31,890
That was really fun.

6884
03:33:33,890 --> 03:33:35,970
How bad are we saying, though?

6885
03:33:36,070 --> 03:33:37,790
In what way is it bad?

6886
03:33:37,970 --> 03:33:42,130
I don't mind bad if it's funny.

6887
03:33:42,430 --> 03:33:45,930
Is the story bad, or is it buggy bad?

6888
03:33:45,930 --> 03:33:46,710
Yeah.

6889
03:33:48,050 --> 03:33:52,690
Like, if it's buggy bad, then maybe not, but if it's story bad, we can make it work.

6890
03:33:52,950 --> 03:33:54,050
I thought this one was great.

6891
03:33:54,310 --> 03:33:55,830
It was like the perfect... Yeah, this one was good.

6892
03:33:58,870 --> 03:34:00,130
This one was pretty good.

6893
03:34:01,450 --> 03:34:02,950
The story is terrible?

6894
03:34:03,170 --> 03:34:03,710
Oh, okay.

6895
03:34:03,770 --> 03:34:05,110
Then that's perfect for us.

6896
03:34:05,790 --> 03:34:06,710
Yeah, pretty much.

6897
03:34:09,550 --> 03:34:29,630
It's like fucking, I was trying to be a mercier, and then Min here was reading a diary in a British accent, while my when we watch somebody get killed, it's like, and then Min was like, You know, whatever.

6898
03:34:30,430 --> 03:34:32,030
Yeah, we'll fix it.

6899
03:34:32,070 --> 03:34:33,250
We can fix the story.

6900
03:34:35,290 --> 03:34:36,070
Don't worry.

6901
03:34:36,250 --> 03:34:38,990
And if the story is boring, we'll just make a podcast.

6902
03:34:41,450 --> 03:34:45,570
Again, guys, it's not the game, it's who plays the game.

6903
03:34:45,630 --> 03:34:46,990
Yeah, it's who plays it.

6904
03:34:46,990 --> 03:34:47,390
Exactly.

6905
03:34:49,170 --> 03:34:50,630
What a great time.

6906
03:34:50,630 --> 03:34:52,350
We gotta continue the trilogy.

6907
03:34:52,810 --> 03:34:54,910
The anthology.

6908
03:34:55,250 --> 03:34:59,110
Yeah, we have to continue the Dark Pictures anthology.

6909
03:35:01,070 --> 03:35:02,030
Oh, god.

6910
03:35:02,610 --> 03:35:03,090
Okay.

6911
03:35:03,230 --> 03:35:04,210
Well, thank you.

6912
03:35:05,390 --> 03:35:09,010
I can't believe everybody lived, other than Beer O'Clock.

6913
03:35:09,050 --> 03:35:09,710
I can't believe it.

6914
03:35:10,830 --> 03:35:14,090
It just happened in such a terrible, stupid way.

6915
03:35:14,310 --> 03:35:18,950
Like, I thought maybe she would die on the ship and be like, oh my god, it's kicking in, and whatever.

6916
03:35:19,250 --> 03:35:19,670
It's the compression.

6917
03:35:19,950 --> 03:35:20,590
Yeah, but no.

6918
03:35:20,630 --> 03:35:23,450
And that one position you make.

6919
03:35:23,790 --> 03:35:25,810
She just collapses on the boat.

6920
03:35:26,230 --> 03:35:27,710
She died of cringe.

6921
03:35:31,630 --> 03:35:32,670
Oh, man.

6922
03:35:33,330 --> 03:35:34,330
Oh, my god.

6923
03:35:34,390 --> 03:35:36,210
It just came out of nowhere, too.

6924
03:35:36,310 --> 03:35:37,490
We were just like, yay!

6925
03:35:37,630 --> 03:35:38,530
We did it!

6926
03:35:38,850 --> 03:35:42,010
Also, we weren't intentionally trying to save them.

6927
03:35:42,170 --> 03:35:45,130
We were just, we just stumbled upon it.

6928
03:35:45,190 --> 03:35:45,510
Yeah.

6929
03:35:47,690 --> 03:35:51,330
We just, like, tripped and fell into saving everybody, somehow.

6930
03:35:54,190 --> 03:35:55,090
Yeah, somehow.

6931
03:35:55,870 --> 03:35:57,590
I mean, we did all the QTE.

6932
03:35:57,610 --> 03:36:00,010
Well, I failed the one QTE, the heartbeat one.

6933
03:36:00,070 --> 03:36:00,810
We still lived.

6934
03:36:02,330 --> 03:36:02,890
Whatever.

6935
03:36:04,310 --> 03:36:04,870
One?

6936
03:36:05,330 --> 03:36:07,090
The one important one.

6937
03:36:07,430 --> 03:36:09,410
The one at the end.

6938
03:36:12,910 --> 03:36:13,470
Okay.

6939
03:36:13,990 --> 03:36:16,650
I see we're rewriting history right now.

6940
03:36:16,950 --> 03:36:17,590
Yeah, yeah.

6941
03:36:17,690 --> 03:36:18,090
Yeah, yeah.

6942
03:36:19,550 --> 03:36:20,810
Yeah, the one.

6943
03:36:22,150 --> 03:36:25,430
I see you're not even paying attention to beer o'clock.

6944
03:36:27,570 --> 03:36:33,650
Beer o'clock wouldn't have happened if, I don't know, you exploded the grill.

6945
03:36:34,090 --> 03:36:35,310
I'm really young!

6946
03:36:35,310 --> 03:36:36,430
Don't do it!

6947
03:36:36,510 --> 03:36:38,050
Do not drink the beer!

6948
03:36:39,430 --> 03:36:41,710
It was beer o'clock!

6949
03:36:42,630 --> 03:36:47,370
The doctor boyfriend was being like, That's a bad idea!

6950
03:36:49,410 --> 03:36:50,430
It was fine.

6951
03:36:50,530 --> 03:36:51,190
It was fine.

6952
03:36:51,190 --> 03:36:51,750
It was fine.

6953
03:36:51,850 --> 03:36:53,310
We didn't care about Julia anyway.

6954
03:36:53,670 --> 03:36:54,390
Yeah, that's true.

6955
03:36:54,550 --> 03:36:55,390
She was kind of stupid.

6956
03:36:55,930 --> 03:36:58,430
Yeah, she was pretty much a Karen, to be fair.

6957
03:36:58,550 --> 03:36:59,050
She was!

6958
03:36:59,210 --> 03:37:06,250
Yeah, so it's like, you know, Alex could have got so much better, you know?

6959
03:37:06,430 --> 03:37:06,810
Yeah.

6960
03:37:07,090 --> 03:37:09,330
Yeah, he saved him from a marriage.

6961
03:37:09,350 --> 03:37:11,830
Now Alex is gonna fall in love with Flix.

6962
03:37:12,370 --> 03:37:13,290
Yeah, Flix.

6963
03:37:13,590 --> 03:37:14,210
Flix, yeah.

6964
03:37:14,470 --> 03:37:15,410
They have to fix him.

6965
03:37:15,410 --> 03:37:15,490
Yeah.

6966
03:37:15,550 --> 03:37:16,850
Yeah, Flix is so much better.

6967
03:37:16,990 --> 03:37:19,090
Yeah, Flix almost got together with Conrad.

6968
03:37:19,370 --> 03:37:21,150
Oh my god.

6969
03:37:21,590 --> 03:37:22,730
They were making out.

6970
03:37:23,510 --> 03:37:24,390
Yeah, yeah.

6971
03:37:24,650 --> 03:37:26,090
And then we saved them.

6972
03:37:26,190 --> 03:37:28,510
We got Flix for Alex now.

6973
03:37:28,850 --> 03:37:29,950
He's a strong woman.

6974
03:37:30,310 --> 03:37:34,930
I can't believe Conrad just literally, like, front of the boat, like, barges into the ship.

6975
03:37:34,930 --> 03:37:36,090
Yeah, where was the coast guard?

6976
03:37:36,370 --> 03:37:37,750
Like, he just went there by himself.

6977
03:37:37,830 --> 03:37:38,550
I don't know.

6978
03:37:39,010 --> 03:37:40,890
He was clearly not driving the boat.

6979
03:37:40,910 --> 03:37:41,230
No!

6980
03:37:41,230 --> 03:37:42,910
Yeah, so it makes no sense.

6981
03:37:42,970 --> 03:37:44,230
Why was he the only one there?

6982
03:37:44,390 --> 03:37:45,770
Yeah, I was like, we're the coast guard.

6983
03:37:45,770 --> 03:37:47,510
Where did the coast guard go?

6984
03:37:48,390 --> 03:37:50,530
Also, how did he get the coordinates?

6985
03:37:51,950 --> 03:37:53,030
Yeah, how did he?

6986
03:37:53,570 --> 03:37:55,010
How did he get the coordinates?

6987
03:37:55,010 --> 03:38:00,970
Well, we gave the coordinates over the radio, but how did he know to go with, like, what?

6988
03:38:01,510 --> 03:38:06,050
Yeah, but then, like, the thing is, they were on the military boat.

6989
03:38:06,150 --> 03:38:06,750
Yeah, exactly.

6990
03:38:07,590 --> 03:38:09,730
Everybody else was also on the military boat.

6991
03:38:09,890 --> 03:38:10,150
Yeah.

6992
03:38:10,650 --> 03:38:12,810
So, like, I'm so confused.

6993
03:38:12,810 --> 03:38:15,430
Why was there nobody behind him?

6994
03:38:19,850 --> 03:38:20,970
Oh my god.

6995
03:38:22,270 --> 03:38:23,790
Alright, everybody lived.

6996
03:38:23,930 --> 03:38:26,370
Everything that happens after credits was a hallucination.

6997
03:38:26,370 --> 03:38:29,910
Someone said if you don't get the distributor cap, you get rescued by the coast guard.

6998
03:38:31,150 --> 03:38:31,690
Oh!

6999
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:34,090
So you picked up the cap.

7000
03:38:36,010 --> 03:38:38,970
You told us, you told me to pick up the cap!

7001
03:38:42,480 --> 03:38:46,320
Okay, but like, if we picked up the cap, then, like...

7002
03:38:47,380 --> 03:38:48,660
Doki killed Conrad.

7003
03:38:48,880 --> 03:38:50,380
Would Conrad be on the boat?

7004
03:38:51,260 --> 03:38:52,780
Would Conrad be on the boat?

7005
03:38:52,900 --> 03:38:57,540
He'd be on the boat and then be like, oh my god, we're rescuing you guys!

7006
03:38:58,060 --> 03:38:59,420
Okay, I think we're getting gaslit.

7007
03:38:59,640 --> 03:39:01,240
I think we're supposed to get...

7008
03:39:01,240 --> 03:39:04,560
I think we're supposed to pick it up.

7009
03:39:05,180 --> 03:39:06,080
I don't know.

7010
03:39:06,560 --> 03:39:09,060
I think we're supposed to pick it up, I'm pretty sure.

7011
03:39:09,280 --> 03:39:11,260
No, because we called the coast guard.

7012
03:39:11,340 --> 03:39:11,860
They were coming.

7013
03:39:11,960 --> 03:39:12,580
They were on their way.

7014
03:39:13,100 --> 03:39:14,740
This cannot be on me.

7015
03:39:15,420 --> 03:39:16,100
I am not.

7016
03:39:19,300 --> 03:39:26,500
Wait, so, so like, if we didn't pick up the distributor cap, we would have seen Conrad on the boat?

7017
03:39:26,680 --> 03:39:27,540
Yeah, I think so.

7018
03:39:27,760 --> 03:39:28,660
I think so.

7019
03:39:29,220 --> 03:39:30,440
Yeah, they were on their way.

7020
03:39:31,040 --> 03:39:33,200
Someone said not picking up gives you the better ending.

7021
03:39:33,380 --> 03:39:34,920
How do I not pick it up?

7022
03:39:35,200 --> 03:39:36,800
Do I just, like, not do it?

7023
03:39:36,940 --> 03:39:37,960
Like, I don't understand.

7024
03:39:38,660 --> 03:39:40,600
How do I not pick up the cap?

7025
03:39:42,040 --> 03:39:45,060
Oh, they would have ran into each other.

7026
03:39:45,080 --> 03:39:47,460
Guys, I gave you guys a different, I gave you guys a cooler ending.

7027
03:39:47,580 --> 03:39:50,920
I think actually the ending we got was so crazy.

7028
03:39:51,460 --> 03:39:53,960
Yeah, the ending we got was so much better.

7029
03:39:54,100 --> 03:39:56,700
It was actually so much better.

7030
03:39:59,440 --> 03:40:03,620
Like, do you guys really want to get rescued by Conrad?

7031
03:40:03,940 --> 03:40:04,580
Come on.

7032
03:40:05,520 --> 03:40:07,360
Someone was like, you got the better ending.

7033
03:40:07,480 --> 03:40:10,440
Now the world is protected from Conrad's frizz.

7034
03:40:11,960 --> 03:40:14,120
We took out both of the siblings.

7035
03:40:14,320 --> 03:40:14,760
It's fine.

7036
03:40:15,240 --> 03:40:18,360
Yeah, we got two for one special.

7037
03:40:18,720 --> 03:40:19,120
Great.

7038
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:21,160
Anyway, thank you, Doki.

7039
03:40:21,300 --> 03:40:22,160
This was a good time.

7040
03:40:22,580 --> 03:40:23,720
That was a good time.

7041
03:40:23,820 --> 03:40:24,240
GG.

7042
03:40:24,860 --> 03:40:28,240
We'll come back for the next Little Hope.

7043
03:40:28,500 --> 03:40:31,040
Whatever one we decide to play, I guess.

7044
03:40:31,320 --> 03:40:32,840
Yeah, yeah, we'll come back to that.

7045
03:40:33,240 --> 03:40:33,720
GG's.

7046
03:40:33,820 --> 03:40:35,620
Alright, we're gonna talk to you in our chats now.

7047
03:40:36,480 --> 03:40:38,080
Alright, see you mid.

7048
03:40:38,200 --> 03:40:38,760
Bye-bye.

7049
03:40:38,840 --> 03:40:39,320
Bye.

7050
03:40:46,930 --> 03:40:48,910
Give me one second, you guys.

7051
03:40:49,030 --> 03:40:50,570
Give me one second.

7052
03:40:51,590 --> 03:41:01,550
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Da-da-da-da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da I'm sending you over.

7053
03:41:02,310 --> 03:41:03,410
We're going to America.

7054
03:41:03,430 --> 03:41:03,810
Bye.

7055
03:41:07,030 --> 03:41:07,670
Chup-chup.

7056
03:41:08,470 --> 03:41:08,910
Yay!

7057
03:41:10,030 --> 03:41:10,470
Yay!

7058
03:41:12,090 --> 03:41:12,530
Yay!

7059
03:41:13,350 --> 03:41:13,790
Yay!

7060
03:41:15,490 --> 03:41:16,670
Let me put on some BGM.

7061
03:41:16,790 --> 03:41:18,270
Oh my gosh, I'm so tired.

7062
03:41:19,890 --> 03:41:24,470
My brain, once again, is just melted from this.

7063
03:41:24,930 --> 03:41:25,930
From this.

7064
03:41:27,710 --> 03:41:28,310
What's this?

7065
03:41:36,830 --> 03:41:37,590
There we go.

7066
03:41:38,850 --> 03:41:40,570
I hope you guys liked it.

7067
03:41:41,250 --> 03:41:42,410
I hope you guys had fun.

7068
03:41:43,530 --> 03:41:46,670
And stuff that was an experience.

7069
03:41:49,550 --> 03:41:50,210
And there you go.

7070
03:41:50,230 --> 03:41:51,170
Thanks for the 20 gifted.

7071
03:41:51,410 --> 03:41:52,770
Cooper, thanks for the 5 gifted.

7072
03:41:52,830 --> 03:41:53,450
Thank you guys so much.

7073
03:41:53,490 --> 03:41:57,790
Thank you for all the Super Chats and all the don't-knows and everything.

7074
03:41:58,250 --> 03:42:00,050
I've been looking at them.

7075
03:42:00,150 --> 03:42:02,250
So sad Julia died of natural cause.

7076
03:42:03,390 --> 03:42:04,450
Thanks for the pink.

7077
03:42:06,190 --> 03:42:08,170
Watching you two together is my beer o'clock.

7078
03:42:08,350 --> 03:42:08,910
Oh my god.

7079
03:42:08,970 --> 03:42:09,890
No, don't die.

7080
03:42:10,150 --> 03:42:10,970
I hate it.

7081
03:42:16,050 --> 03:42:17,010
That was fun.

7082
03:42:18,750 --> 03:42:19,990
Anthology was so goofy.

7083
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:20,510
I know.

7084
03:42:20,570 --> 03:42:21,870
I kind of love them.

7085
03:42:22,110 --> 03:42:23,390
I love them so much.

7086
03:42:23,510 --> 03:42:24,810
I think that one's my favorite.

7087
03:42:24,850 --> 03:42:26,190
Just because it's like...

7088
03:42:28,310 --> 03:42:29,770
It's like my...

7089
03:42:30,550 --> 03:42:32,430
I like that it's kind of based...

7090
03:42:32,430 --> 03:42:35,710
Well, I guess it's Little Hope also based on a true thing.

7091
03:42:35,850 --> 03:42:36,390
I don't know.

7092
03:42:36,510 --> 03:42:39,770
But I like that Man of Medan is actually based on a true thing.

7093
03:42:39,990 --> 03:42:42,070
It makes it a little bit more interesting for me.

7094
03:42:42,250 --> 03:42:43,110
Peak comedy.

7095
03:42:43,110 --> 03:42:45,190
Mint Doki Kusage's winning formula.

7096
03:42:45,530 --> 03:42:47,610
Oh, that was my controller.

7097
03:42:49,170 --> 03:42:50,070
Winning combo.

7098
03:42:53,250 --> 03:42:54,570
Glad I caught this.

7099
03:42:54,770 --> 03:42:55,290
Thank you!

7100
03:42:55,550 --> 03:42:57,930
You guys trolled the narrator guys so hard.

7101
03:42:58,790 --> 03:43:00,330
Spoiled my beer o'clock.

7102
03:43:03,650 --> 03:43:05,250
Gosh, that was so funny.

7103
03:43:05,390 --> 03:43:08,250
I can't believe of all things he just ends up dying.

7104
03:43:09,350 --> 03:43:15,850
We Conrads never hear our names said in media so this was an absolute treat hearing y'all say Hi Conrad.

7105
03:43:16,130 --> 03:43:17,030
Conrad's gonna die.

7106
03:43:18,650 --> 03:43:19,970
For your beer o'clock.

7107
03:43:20,050 --> 03:43:20,890
Oh, thank you.

7108
03:43:21,530 --> 03:43:22,730
Thanks for the great collab.

7109
03:43:22,990 --> 03:43:23,410
Thank you!

7110
03:43:23,850 --> 03:43:26,330
That was one of the most hilarious brain rotting collabs of all time.

7111
03:43:26,730 --> 03:43:28,850
I'm glad that we were able to get through the whole thing.

7112
03:43:29,170 --> 03:43:30,470
I was wondering if...

7113
03:43:31,650 --> 03:43:34,630
Because I wasn't sure how long the game was so...

7114
03:43:35,150 --> 03:43:36,110
But glad it...

7115
03:43:36,630 --> 03:43:40,530
Glad it ended up working out and that we were able to just complete it.

7116
03:43:40,550 --> 03:43:48,370
I think it's longer if you do it by yourself because obviously you're going to be going back and forth between people more but...

7117
03:43:50,370 --> 03:43:50,810
Yeah.

7118
03:43:51,070 --> 03:43:52,010
It's a good length.

7119
03:43:52,150 --> 03:43:52,690
I think so too.

7120
03:43:54,730 --> 03:43:55,710
I think so too.

7121
03:43:56,610 --> 03:43:57,750
That was so fun.

7122
03:43:59,190 --> 03:44:00,610
Longer if you're solo and thorough.

7123
03:44:00,970 --> 03:44:01,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7124
03:44:02,050 --> 03:44:03,950
Also I was like kind of skimming the notes.

7125
03:44:06,170 --> 03:44:08,950
I've been craving for someone new to play this and you guys were so fun.

7126
03:44:09,070 --> 03:44:09,630
Thank you!

7127
03:44:11,230 --> 03:44:13,270
Yeah, it's like you don't really see it very often played.

7128
03:44:13,790 --> 03:44:16,690
I mean, it is kind of kusoge but it's so fun, right?

7129
03:44:17,570 --> 03:44:18,750
Thanks for another silly collab.

7130
03:44:18,950 --> 03:44:20,050
Also my postcard came in today.

7131
03:44:20,150 --> 03:44:21,010
It looked like it was in condition.

7132
03:44:21,410 --> 03:44:21,810
Yippee!

7133
03:44:22,110 --> 03:44:24,770
I already ordered the new postcard so...

7134
03:44:25,330 --> 03:44:26,910
You'll have two of them!

7135
03:44:27,270 --> 03:44:29,170
I can't believe we didn't get the death POV.

7136
03:44:29,250 --> 03:44:29,690
We did!

7137
03:44:30,630 --> 03:44:31,230
Kind of.

7138
03:44:31,890 --> 03:44:34,130
I don't know what's up with me and the heartbeat ones though.

7139
03:44:34,190 --> 03:44:35,210
They really stress me out.

7140
03:44:37,310 --> 03:44:38,850
They really stress me out.

7141
03:44:40,510 --> 03:44:41,330
But um...

7142
03:44:41,330 --> 03:44:42,170
But um...

7143
03:44:42,170 --> 03:44:42,570
You know...

7144
03:44:44,150 --> 03:44:44,630
Whatever.

7145
03:44:46,330 --> 03:44:47,510
It's fine, everybody lived.

7146
03:44:48,530 --> 03:44:49,390
Pre-credits.

7147
03:44:51,070 --> 03:44:52,710
Both of you are so cute and silly.

7148
03:44:53,430 --> 03:44:53,910
Both of you are so cute and silly.

7149
03:44:56,110 --> 03:44:57,070
Man, okay.

7150
03:44:57,310 --> 03:44:59,810
It's getting late so I'm gonna head out now.

7151
03:45:00,810 --> 03:45:02,110
I hope you guys had fun.

7152
03:45:02,330 --> 03:45:05,250
I hope you guys have a great night or a great day or whatever.

7153
03:45:06,770 --> 03:45:07,650
And um...

7154
03:45:07,650 --> 03:45:08,570
Thanks again for watching.

7155
03:45:08,630 --> 03:45:09,430
Thanks again for hanging out.

7156
03:45:09,510 --> 03:45:11,550
It's been so long since you've had a beating heart.

7157
03:45:11,610 --> 03:45:12,490
It freaked you out I guess.

7158
03:45:12,730 --> 03:45:13,170
True!

7159
03:45:14,310 --> 03:45:14,750
True.

7160
03:45:14,930 --> 03:45:15,810
What's the stream tomorrow?

7161
03:45:20,370 --> 03:45:20,810
Uh...

7162
03:45:23,070 --> 03:45:26,410
I can tell you it will start at the same time as today.

7163
03:45:27,830 --> 03:45:33,510
I actually have no idea because I've been so busy getting ready for Anime Expo and stuff.

7164
03:45:35,250 --> 03:45:35,690
Oh my gosh.

7165
03:45:35,690 --> 03:45:36,390
When I tell you...

7166
03:45:36,390 --> 03:45:38,790
So yesterday... Yeah, yesterday was Sunday.

7167
03:45:39,070 --> 03:45:42,850
Yesterday, Matara and I recorded um...

7168
03:45:43,570 --> 03:45:44,010
recorded...

7169
03:45:44,010 --> 03:45:48,990
The collabs between Mint and Doki are some of the best collabs of all time.

7170
03:45:50,010 --> 03:45:51,390
Thank you, I'm glad to think so.

7171
03:45:52,910 --> 03:45:53,350
Um...

7172
03:45:54,310 --> 03:45:54,750
Uh...

7173
03:45:54,750 --> 03:45:57,670
She and I recorded Sunday.

7174
03:45:57,770 --> 03:46:02,850
We recorded two things on Sunday and then we recorded two things today for the podcast.

7175
03:46:02,930 --> 03:46:04,330
So I'm just like...

7176
03:46:05,250 --> 03:46:08,250
I have not had a chance to even think about anything.

7177
03:46:08,630 --> 03:46:10,170
So um...

7178
03:46:11,750 --> 03:46:12,370
Uh...

7179
03:46:12,370 --> 03:46:15,050
Like we recorded yesterday's... or today's podcast.

7180
03:46:15,190 --> 03:46:16,850
We did it all yesterday basically.

7181
03:46:17,810 --> 03:46:19,110
And Saturday night.

7182
03:46:19,350 --> 03:46:20,630
No, we did Saturday night.

7183
03:46:20,730 --> 03:46:21,670
Then yesterday.

7184
03:46:22,110 --> 03:46:24,430
After I did two streams.

7185
03:46:24,980 --> 03:46:25,830
And then...

7186
03:46:25,830 --> 03:46:28,090
And then we did two more today.

7187
03:46:28,110 --> 03:46:29,990
My brain is a little bush so...

7188
03:46:29,990 --> 03:46:31,790
It might be pretty chill tomorrow.

7189
03:46:31,970 --> 03:46:33,150
Maybe like...

7190
03:46:35,590 --> 03:46:36,790
If you'll allow me.

7191
03:46:37,890 --> 03:46:38,690
And um...

7192
03:46:39,190 --> 03:46:40,730
Then Wednesday will be Metal Gear.

7193
03:46:41,890 --> 03:46:45,230
And Thursday is... is Anime Expo.

7194
03:46:45,810 --> 03:46:46,210
So...

7195
03:46:47,510 --> 03:46:48,850
Did you buy any of those games?

7196
03:46:48,930 --> 03:46:49,570
I did actually.

7197
03:46:49,710 --> 03:46:52,410
Actually, so it's really funny because I had them all in my cart.

7198
03:46:52,750 --> 03:46:54,450
I should have probably just wishlist them.

7199
03:46:54,630 --> 03:46:55,870
But they were all in my cart.

7200
03:46:56,070 --> 03:46:57,730
And then I had to buy Man of Medan.

7201
03:46:57,870 --> 03:46:58,850
So I was just like...

7202
03:46:58,850 --> 03:47:02,270
Oh, I'm not gonna remove all of them just to buy...

7203
03:47:03,050 --> 03:47:03,730
Buy one.

7204
03:47:03,990 --> 03:47:04,650
Thank you!

7205
03:47:05,770 --> 03:47:07,110
Thank you, Tri-Princess!

7206
03:47:08,570 --> 03:47:09,450
Um, so...

7207
03:47:10,030 --> 03:47:11,930
I just bought them all.

7208
03:47:14,150 --> 03:47:15,650
I got Bloons from the same sale.

7209
03:47:15,690 --> 03:47:16,910
Yeah, it's on like super sale!

7210
03:47:17,450 --> 03:47:18,550
And it's so fun.

7211
03:47:20,230 --> 03:47:20,670
Hmm...

7212
03:47:21,050 --> 03:47:26,650
When you brought up Mata's stream from Friday, I knew you all had recorded it like yesterday.

7213
03:47:26,790 --> 03:47:28,490
Yeah, it was like really, really...

7214
03:47:28,490 --> 03:47:32,290
She wasn't... She hasn't been feeling well, so...

7215
03:47:32,290 --> 03:47:34,610
It's been kind of hard to get our...

7216
03:47:35,250 --> 03:47:37,410
I have to change the thing on the menu.

7217
03:47:38,070 --> 03:47:39,090
To today's episode.

7218
03:47:39,490 --> 03:47:40,530
Wait, I think I have it.

7219
03:47:40,550 --> 03:47:40,810
Hold on.

7220
03:47:41,330 --> 03:47:43,990
But it's been kind of hard with our schedules lately.

7221
03:47:44,350 --> 03:47:45,170
I'll be honest.

7222
03:47:46,190 --> 03:47:46,990
So, um...

7223
03:47:49,310 --> 03:48:01,490
But, you know, I think that's like the hardest thing about kind of doing the podcast so far has been just kind of being...

7224
03:48:01,490 --> 03:48:03,030
Oh, I don't think I have it saved.

7225
03:48:03,030 --> 03:48:03,410
Never mind.

7226
03:48:03,510 --> 03:48:05,410
Is having our schedules aligned.

7227
03:48:05,970 --> 03:48:06,410
So...

7228
03:48:08,410 --> 03:48:09,830
She says she's getting better.

7229
03:48:09,990 --> 03:48:10,870
Yeah, a little bit.

7230
03:48:11,470 --> 03:48:13,850
She still has a cough sometimes, but...

7231
03:48:13,850 --> 03:48:14,430
Renski!

7232
03:48:14,630 --> 03:48:15,490
Thanks for the 5k!

7233
03:48:15,570 --> 03:48:16,050
Thank you!

7234
03:48:18,990 --> 03:48:19,430
Um...

7235
03:48:20,310 --> 03:48:21,190
Also, Grant...

7236
03:48:21,190 --> 03:48:22,490
I see or don't know.

7237
03:48:23,110 --> 03:48:24,610
Have you seen Deadly Premonition?

7238
03:48:24,750 --> 03:48:25,990
It's 1.24 on Steam.

7239
03:48:26,130 --> 03:48:27,150
I did get it, actually.

7240
03:48:27,590 --> 03:48:29,810
You need a lot of fan patching.

7241
03:48:29,810 --> 03:48:31,630
I got it because...

7242
03:48:32,990 --> 03:48:34,730
I want to play Deadly Premonition.

7243
03:48:35,670 --> 03:48:37,930
But I know that the Steam one is not very good.

7244
03:48:38,670 --> 03:48:41,710
But I got it because, I mean, it was a doll loop.

7245
03:48:41,850 --> 03:48:43,130
And I like having options.

7246
03:48:43,130 --> 03:48:46,430
If, you know, the Switch version doesn't work out.

7247
03:48:47,250 --> 03:48:47,690
So...

7248
03:48:48,210 --> 03:48:49,410
MiniSkoda, I saw you!

7249
03:48:49,670 --> 03:48:50,550
Thank you for the 5k!

7250
03:48:50,810 --> 03:48:51,570
Thank you!

7251
03:48:53,610 --> 03:48:54,750
Thank you so much!

7252
03:48:55,630 --> 03:48:59,790
My birthday is coming up on the 3rd, but I won't be able to be here since I leave for AX.

7253
03:48:59,810 --> 03:49:01,010
Oh no!

7254
03:49:01,410 --> 03:49:02,790
Can I get a quick happy birthday?

7255
03:49:03,030 --> 03:49:04,550
Also, I'm excited to see you this Friday.

7256
03:49:04,710 --> 03:49:05,670
You're gonna be there?

7257
03:49:05,770 --> 03:49:06,170
Thank you!

7258
03:49:06,530 --> 03:49:07,430
Oh my gosh, Friday.

7259
03:49:08,270 --> 03:49:10,370
I have to practice my songs.

7260
03:49:11,990 --> 03:49:14,690
Happy birthday to you.

7261
03:49:15,630 --> 03:49:18,070
Happy birthday to you.

7262
03:49:18,970 --> 03:49:22,370
Happy birthday, dear weeaboo danger.

7263
03:49:25,830 --> 03:49:28,890
Happy birthday to you.

7264
03:49:31,890 --> 03:49:32,650
Happy birthday!

7265
03:49:34,490 --> 03:49:35,590
Yeah, um...

7266
03:49:35,590 --> 03:49:36,230
What was I gonna say?

7267
03:49:36,990 --> 03:49:39,630
Yeah, I have to practice my songs.

7268
03:49:39,810 --> 03:49:41,190
For Friday.

7269
03:49:41,410 --> 03:49:42,410
Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous.

7270
03:49:42,910 --> 03:49:43,810
I'm so nervous!

7271
03:49:44,050 --> 03:49:45,650
Alien Isolation is also $10.

7272
03:49:46,370 --> 03:49:48,010
Thank you for letting me know!

7273
03:49:49,310 --> 03:49:50,350
I'll go at it.

7274
03:49:50,710 --> 03:49:51,810
How much is it usually?

7275
03:49:52,710 --> 03:49:54,950
That game stresses me out though.

7276
03:49:56,230 --> 03:49:58,290
That game stresses me out.

7277
03:49:58,410 --> 03:49:58,670
That game stresses me out.

7278
03:50:01,910 --> 03:50:02,650
Hmm...

7279
03:50:04,770 --> 03:50:05,510
Mmm...

7280
03:50:05,510 --> 03:50:05,710
Mmmmm...

7281
03:50:05,710 --> 03:50:08,090
Wait, there's a season pass?

7282
03:50:09,490 --> 03:50:11,570
What's the season pass for?

7283
03:50:15,070 --> 03:50:16,590
Beer O'Clock...

7284
03:50:17,570 --> 03:50:18,830
Hey, doggy.

7285
03:50:19,450 --> 03:50:20,190
Hahaha

7286
03:50:23,500 --> 03:50:27,170
If anyone invites you to explore a giant trending abandon ship.

7287
03:50:27,410 --> 03:50:29,750
Just- Fr- Frig... Fridgerate..

7288
03:50:30,370 --> 03:50:31,290
What's that mean?

7289
03:50:33,410 --> 03:50:34,310
Anyway, okay.

7290
03:50:34,810 --> 03:50:36,650
I'm gonna go because I got stuff to do.

7291
03:50:37,650 --> 03:50:39,470
So... and I gotta rest.

7292
03:50:39,750 --> 03:50:41,010
Thank you guys so much.

7293
03:50:41,130 --> 03:50:42,410
I hope you guys had fun.

7294
03:50:42,710 --> 03:50:44,810
Thank you as always for hanging out.

7295
03:50:45,750 --> 03:50:48,530
And I will see you guys tomorrow for Probably Blues.

7296
03:50:50,170 --> 03:50:51,050
Probably Blues.

7297
03:50:55,350 --> 03:50:58,710
I managed to get my hands on the MGS vinyl collection.

7298
03:50:58,810 --> 03:50:59,290
I'm so hyped.

7299
03:50:59,290 --> 03:51:00,110
Yes, me too!

7300
03:51:00,310 --> 03:51:02,170
Except it doesn't come out until October.

7301
03:51:02,390 --> 03:51:03,030
I'm so sad.

7302
03:51:03,450 --> 03:51:05,530
Only caught the last half so I'll have to watch the vibe.

7303
03:51:05,810 --> 03:51:09,030
You should give Still Wakes the Deep a try for a whore.

7304
03:51:09,170 --> 03:51:10,430
Still Wakes the Deep.

7305
03:51:11,550 --> 03:51:12,790
Still Wakes the Deep.

7306
03:51:13,190 --> 03:51:14,610
Thank you for letting me know.

7307
03:51:16,790 --> 03:51:17,570
Oh, wait a second.

7308
03:51:18,170 --> 03:51:19,010
Oh, actually!

7309
03:51:19,470 --> 03:51:20,750
This is on my wish list.

7310
03:51:22,890 --> 03:51:26,890
This is what Matara and I talked about in the podcast.

7311
03:51:28,070 --> 03:51:28,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

7312
03:51:29,290 --> 03:51:29,370
Thank you for the rest.

7313
03:51:29,550 --> 03:51:30,050
Thank you for the stream.

7314
03:51:30,110 --> 03:51:30,570
Thank you!

7315
03:51:30,730 --> 03:51:31,550
Thank you, thank you.

7316
03:51:32,170 --> 03:51:33,170
14 endings?

7317
03:51:33,910 --> 03:51:35,290
Wait, what has 14 endings?

7318
03:51:35,530 --> 03:51:38,750
There's 14 endings for Man of Medan?

7319
03:51:39,050 --> 03:51:39,590
No way.

7320
03:51:43,070 --> 03:51:44,370
Good luck everybody.

7321
03:51:46,830 --> 03:51:47,830
Holy shit!

7322
03:51:48,470 --> 03:51:50,270
Why are there so many endings?

7323
03:51:52,190 --> 03:51:53,090
Oh my god.

7324
03:51:53,710 --> 03:51:56,670
I mean, I guess there has to be an ending for like...

7325
03:51:57,790 --> 03:52:00,370
Each person dying and each person surviving.

7326
03:52:00,830 --> 03:52:03,990
I'm looking at the video and it's one hour long of it.

7327
03:52:07,110 --> 03:52:07,990
What the hell?

7328
03:52:09,510 --> 03:52:12,570
Yeah, because of who lives and dies and if you call the radio or the boat.

7329
03:52:12,750 --> 03:52:13,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

7330
03:52:14,630 --> 03:52:15,490
Oh my god.

7331
03:52:16,390 --> 03:52:17,970
I guess it's time to watch them all.

7332
03:52:18,050 --> 03:52:19,010
I want to see how people die.

7333
03:52:20,730 --> 03:52:21,130
Okay.

7334
03:52:21,510 --> 03:52:21,910
Okay.

7335
03:52:22,310 --> 03:52:22,990
I'm heading out.

7336
03:52:23,270 --> 03:52:23,670
What?

7337
03:52:23,670 --> 03:52:24,270
Enjoy!

7338
03:52:24,330 --> 03:52:24,990
Thank you for the video!

7339
03:52:25,310 --> 03:52:25,890
Thank you!

7340
03:52:26,370 --> 03:52:27,470
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

7341
03:52:28,750 --> 03:52:29,910
Thank you, thank you.

7342
03:52:30,170 --> 03:52:31,370
Ah, there it is.

7343
03:52:31,530 --> 03:52:32,170
Thanks, Grant!

7344
03:52:33,590 --> 03:52:34,030
Okay.

7345
03:52:34,130 --> 03:52:34,770
Thank you guys!

7346
03:52:35,970 --> 03:52:36,810
See you later.

7347
03:52:36,970 --> 03:52:37,630
See you tomorrow.

7348
03:52:39,390 --> 03:52:39,830
And...

7349
03:52:41,030 --> 03:52:42,630
Yeah, I'll probably just play Bloons.

7350
03:52:42,710 --> 03:52:43,030
Okay.

7351
03:52:44,410 --> 03:52:44,850
Bye!

7352
03:52:44,990 --> 03:52:45,770
Have a good night!

7353
03:52:46,230 --> 03:52:46,850
Have a good night!

7354
03:52:47,390 --> 03:52:47,990
Bye bye!
