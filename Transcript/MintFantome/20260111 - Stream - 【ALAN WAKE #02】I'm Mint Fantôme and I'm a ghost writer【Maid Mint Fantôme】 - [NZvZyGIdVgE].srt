1
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,720
They call me Alan because I'd be awake.

2
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,780
I'm not awake.

3
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,640
I'm so sleepy.

4
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,760
Suppressing Yon.

5
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,780
Suppression successful.

6
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,480
No, now I'm thinking it.

7
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,240
Alan wake!

8
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,880
Alan wake, Alan woke, and then Alan walked, and Alan ran,
and Alan did a bunch of things, actually.

9
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,580
Don't say John Wick!

10
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,380
Don't do it!

11
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,620
Wait, did it just start the intro again?

12
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
Whatever, it's fine.

13
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,960
That wasn't me yawning, that was me silently yelling.

14
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
I hope you're feeling a bit better.

15
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm sorry, my very...

16
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,900
I'm okay.

17
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,220
I'm sorry, my very first playthrough of MGS today.

18
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,600
I beat Psycho Mantis.

19
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
Excited to start playing more.

20
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,260
Yeah!

21
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,700
Also, Mambo, thank you so much for the 10 gifts.

22
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,720
Thank you!

23
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,480
Psycho Mantis fight is always, like, such a good...

24
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,100
A good...

25
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,560
Like, you know?

26
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
And then...

27
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,260
You know?

28
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,420
And then also...

29
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,720
you know we have to thank you for the podcast

30
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm watching the new John John no John who John

31
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:32,620
don't say John no I had a dream about a VTuber donuts collab
but I didn't get to eat one so now I'm going to go get one

32
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:39,980
for real what's up with all the donuts We're donuts lately.

33
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,620
Donuts lately.

34
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,640
Thank you.

35
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,740
Dispatch, right?

36
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,960
Joy, y'all.

37
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,660
No, this is Alan.

38
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,600
This is Alan.

39
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,080
I'm drinking coffee right now.

40
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,420
I did not sleep well.

41
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,900
So I'm a little sleepy.

42
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,620
I need to Alan wake up for real.

43
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,820
Holy cow.

44
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,860
Oh my gosh, I need to Alan wake up.

45
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
No, no Alan sweep.

46
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,680
No sweep.

47
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,000
Wait, Alan sweep.

48
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,820
Alan wake up and Alan do the thing.

49
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,980
I have to remember how to play this game too.

50
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,920
Just a heads up for everybody.

51
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,660
I'm feeling a little icky.

52
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,440
A little under the water today.

53
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,040
But we do our best.

54
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,020
We do our besties.

55
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,590
Um...

56
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,430
So I'm just gonna get into it because, um...

57
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,790
What time am I streaming with Doki?

58
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,830
Oh, yeah, I remember.

59
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,530
I remember.

60
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,630
I have lots of time.

61
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,590
Let's keep playing.

62
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,250
I love that.

63
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,570
Your health will slowly recharge.

64
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,710
If you can avoid...

65
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,190
Take a damage.

66
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,590
Worst weather I've ever seen.

67
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,850
You should put some coffee on.

68
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,890
It'll warm you up.

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,030
That's him.

70
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:15,090
I'm Alan Wake, I'm Alan.

71
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,930
Wait, coffee!

72
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,790
Oh my gosh, wait, I forgot!

73
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,510
That's really what we were here for.

74
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,790
Whoa, my goodness, the weather.

75
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,310
Also...

76
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:31,850
What is this castle my man is living in?

77
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,770
Hello?

78
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:37,290
Why are we in this...

79
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,030
What is this place?

80
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,790
Do we live at Hogwarts?

81
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,610
For real!

82
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,850
Oh my, what's this?

83
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:46,810
We got a new TV?

84
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,230
It's a CC!

85
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,270
Wow, those are really good.

86
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,290
See?

87
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,450
Wait, that looks like a Metal Gear font, no?

88
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,390
A little bit?

89
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,250
Dang.

90
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,130
Kind of.

91
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,350
A little bit.

92
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:16,830
I thought we were in New York, but like Oh my goodness, how
conceit.

93
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:17,210
Hey handsome.

94
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,170
This is going to be a long night, but these shots are
turning out great.

95
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,410
I guess you're going to need that coffee then.

96
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,590
I'll go put it on.

97
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,130
Oh, we got the Tharmos.

98
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,830
Oh yeah.

99
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,790
Look at that.

100
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,950
Wait, these look like actual photographs.

101
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,450
These are renders from the game.

102
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:35,990
That looks like a real man.

103
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,130
Also, what is going on here?

104
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,210
Alan, thank you so much for the fun.

105
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:41,970
Get the dick.

106
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,490
Thank you!

107
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:44,850
The real!

108
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,830
That's the actor!

109
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,610
Wait, are these real?

110
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,170
Wait, I'm climbing up the stairs.

111
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,470
Alan climb?

112
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,810
Wait, what are you doing up there?

113
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:53,670
Oh my god!

114
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,230
What are you doing up here?

115
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,390
Oh my god!

116
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,620
Alan, don't do it!

117
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,260
Hello wife!

118
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,120
Okay, okay.

119
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:20,160
I have to remember how to play, but I forget that we can
only go into like combat mode when the spooky things are

120
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,460
happening.

121
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,460
Why is there a QR code on the wall?

122
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,960
Wait, what am I examining?

123
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,240
I'm examining this, but not the QR code?

124
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:40,490
If I didn't know any better, I would think that the book
series was called Alan Wake.

125
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:58,410
an Casey thriller why is your name so big then right like
okay hold on I'm gonna scan this there's my phone right here

126
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:12,160
I'm gonna scan it also I hear a radio but I don't know where
it's coming from I see YouTube what is this vision 2 what is

127
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,840
this.

128
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,870
Vision's carried by the ebb and flow of different dream
states.

129
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,990
I see tin from the reality beyond.

130
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:23,770
He's riding.

131
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,070
Wait, hold on.

132
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,850
Let's get away from the radio because it's annoying.

133
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,230
The radio sound is annoying.

134
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,570
Is it in here?

135
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,110
Oh, it must be.

136
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,550
Oh, yes, let's turn this off.

137
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,030
Please.

138
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:40,790
Or turn on.

139
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,490
Oh, or turn on.

140
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,400
Overcompensation for internal frailty.

141
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,210
Wow, wait.

142
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:03,150
Oh, it didn't make their side of the bed.

143
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,990
Okay, let me watch this video.

144
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,170
It's only a minute long.

145
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,310
Also things I couldn't possibly know.

146
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,830
I used them in my writing.

147
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,950
Can you hear it?

148
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:15,410
So that the parts that weren't would become so.

149
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,970
And there were visions that I knew were not real.

150
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,810
Ideas I had lost.

151
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,550
He's just at a typewriter.

152
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,530
I had written about him for years.

153
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,730
I used them as well.

154
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,670
The lies had to feel true for them to become true.

155
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,430
Had I always written this way?

156
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,010
Even before.

157
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:39,170
Seen things without realizing I was seeing them.

158
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,450
Was I really always this bad at writing?

159
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,710
Was this what inspiration was for me?

160
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,970
Wait, I missed Vision 1 then.

161
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,690
That's so sad.

162
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,710
Okay.

163
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:52,510
Okay.

164
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,250
Okay.

165
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,170
Good job.

166
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:54,850
You can do it.

167
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,810
You can do it, Alan.

168
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,130
Alex Casey is literally legally distinct Max Payne.

169
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,030
Can I go in the closet?

170
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,450
Oh, shoot, I can.

171
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,410
Can I leave the closet?

172
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,430
It swings both ways.

173
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,690
Wow, that is a small washing machine.

174
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,350
Why is it in your bathroom?

175
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,170
Okay.

176
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:22,470
Okay.

177
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,070
Can we take a shower?

178
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,110
We're not stinky enough.

179
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,890
A candle in the bathroom.

180
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:31,910
Ooh!

181
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:37,670
Wow, this is a really nice bathroom, though.

182
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,410
Yeah, it's a little...

183
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,710
There's another candle.

184
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,410
I don't know if that one needs to be there.

185
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,490
Both of their toothbrushes in one cup.

186
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,330
Okay.

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,450

197
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,630

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,210
I just finished those cover mock-ups.

205
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:05,150
They're on your desk.

206
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,210
Tell me what you think.

207
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:07,390
No kidding.

208
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,690
I didn't think you'd get them done this quickly.

209
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:14,070
On occasion, I can perform all sorts of miracles, my dear.

210
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:15,150
That was the audio, by the way.

211
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:15,750
Just let me know.

212
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,250
Oh, yeah, I saw these.

213
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,610
Wait, he puts himself on the cover also?

214
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,730
Is this about...

215
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,130
Is this an autobiography or...

216
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,590
These look really good.

217
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,330
Oh, sure, until Barry gets his hands on them.

218
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,350
Which, by the way, will happen over my dead body.

219
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,250
These look really good.

220
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:35,350
The last time was the last time.

221
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,970
Oh, and speaking of Barry, he called.

222
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,410
Alan, please check the fuse box.

223
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,170

225
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,870

226
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:47,730

228
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,330
It's right here, right?

229
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,070
I'm right here, baby.

230
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:50,910
Yeah.

231
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,390

232
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,950
I'm fine.

233
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,630
Just get the lights back on.

234
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,210
Now, please.

235
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:55,370
Oh, it's a power outage.

236
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,910
Oh, I've got the flashlight.

237
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,430
Oh, shoot.

238
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,790
Okay.

239
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,190

243
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,750
I used to have these nightmares when I was a kid.

244
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,730
The dark really spooked me too.

245
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,790
They like talk over each other.

246
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,430
It's so funny.

247
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,230
My mom gave me this old light switch.

248
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,590
She called it the clicker.

249
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:39,890
The clicker, huh?

250
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,810
The clicker?

251
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:46,010
If I ever got scared of the dark, I could just flip the
switch and a magic light would scare the monsters away.

252
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,050
Oh, sure.

253
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,630
That's what I do in the game.

254
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,570
Here it is.

255
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:50,750
The clicker.

256
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,850
Maybe it'll help you too.

257
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,090
Yeah, a nice story writer, boy.

258
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,790

He made that up right now, didn't he?

260
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:56,350
No, no.

261
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:57,870

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:06,030
If you prefer a lure, now if you want either trout or salmon
on the other hand, then it's fly fishing for you.

276
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,510
Um, you a fishing man, Mr. Wick?

277
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,350

I think it's just they're talking, but I'll turn it up.

279
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:14,370
But it can be very relaxing out there.

280
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,670

I'd lain here in the snow while the lurid chain of scenes
that had led me here kept playing in my head.

332
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,040
A rerun of my own private snuff movie.

333
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,020
A memory of my corpse.

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,160
Yeah, this is Thornton.

352
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,520
Look, we've located the gray float.

353
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,200
It's here.

354
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,640
That's some goodness, right?

355
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,260
Stucky was supposed to be driving it at the rehearsal today.

356
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:13,940
Over.

357
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,820
Oh, give me that.

358
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,620
Well, we saw someone else driving it.

359
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:18,320
Looks like someone really fresh.

360
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,020
The garage.

361
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:19,660
Over.

362
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,340
That wasn't me.

363
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,400
Roger that, guys.

364
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,260
Keep looking for Stucky.

365
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,180
That guy's long gone.

366
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,840
That guy is dead, dead, dead.

367
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,900
Wait, so if they die possessed, do they die in real life?

368
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,780
I guess so.

369
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,640
I wanted to see what the other side of that was, but...

370
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:36,920
Oh, well.

371
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:37,540
Okay.

372
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,160
Sheriff Breaker is waiting for you down the corridor in her
office.

373
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,380
I'm going, I'm going.

374
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,160
Triple dead.

375
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,120
Dead, dead, dead.

376
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,600
Your phone's on the desk.

377
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,680
The battery was dead.

378
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:50,720
It's charged now.

379
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,440

Stop talking to the law.

387

wife again.

389
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,240
Go to the back lot.

390
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,080
There's a hole in the fence on the left.

391
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,720
Look inside the junker.

392
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,880
I left a little something there to convince you we're all on
the same page here.

393
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,380
After you ditched the cops, you're going to meet me in
Elderwood National Park.

394
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,000
There's a spot called Lover's Peak.

395
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,080
Lover's Peak.

396
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,480

These cells are humongous.

It was a goddamn space alien!

409
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:15,060

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:32,890

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,790

Just kidding, I won't.

441
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:37,150
Alice's driver's license had been placed on the front seat.

442
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:37,650
Oh, it was.

443
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,830
The caller meant business.

444
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,290
Uh-oh.

445
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:42,510
Mushy, mushy.

446
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,030

447
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,830
Ow, ow, thank God.

448
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:45,830
Where the hell have you been?

449
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,610
I've been trying to reach you for a week.

450
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,490
You and Alice.

451
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,010
I've been worried sick.

452
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:51,010
I flew out yesterday.

453
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,150
Barry!

454
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:54,710
Barry!

455
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,930
I'm at the sheriff's station.

456
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:56,990
Come and get me.

457
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,010
I can't talk now.

458
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:58,370
Ow!

459
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,450
What the hell is going on?

460
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,150
What are these berries?

461
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,170
You think we can eat them?

462
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:05,430
I needed to get to Elderwood National Park to meet Alice's
kidnappers.

463
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,110
Exit the sheriff's station.

464
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,050
I mean, I could just jump over the fence, right?

465
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:12,770
Let's just try that.

466
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:13,850
Wait.

467
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,390
Come on, Alan, jump!

468
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:18,790
Alan, parkour!

469
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,570
Alan, parkour!

470
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,650
That'd be cool, we're taking so much for the five kisses!

471
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,590
I know we can pull this.

472
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,750
Come on, come on, game.

473
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,350
Let me sequence break a little.

474
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,770
These berries, whatever they are, look delicious.

475
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,820
That's how...

476
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,400
That's, you know, I'm just following primal instinct.

477
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,280
He's afraid of fences, probably.

478
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,280
Are you okay?

479
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,600
You asleep?

480
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,480
Oh!

481
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:00,340
a writer is alike that reveals the world of his story
through darkness you shut up shapes it from nothingness the

482
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:09,300
way a sculptor carves a statue from a block of granite if i
stop the world i'm making dies darkness will reclaim it it's

483
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:15,760
a long hard journey into the dark alice's life is at stake
but i can't think about that or i'll lose it the dread

484
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,740
lingers at the edge of perception i'll push on anything is
possible here i'll write the story i'll save her

485
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:25,720
Oh.

486
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,240
Uh-oh.

487
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,280
You good, buddy?

488
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,800
You need that CPAP machine?

489
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,600
Oh, boy.

490
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,560
I'm gonna turn off the lights for him.

491
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:44,360
I just wanted to settle all the damage the Anderson brothers
might have inadvertently caused on their recent and

492
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,360
regrettable little outing.

493
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,820
They are not accountable for their actions.

494
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,040
Of course, I can assure you that my staff has been
reprimanded.

495
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:03,240
Odin never caused any trouble to anyone when they were still
living at their farm indeed all we can do is to slow down

496
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:09,600
the progress of their dementia can you do that oh are you
feeling any better mr.

talk about under arrest oh no that's always so suspicious

498

in touch with you I'd avoid the motel the majestic is known

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,620
I thought they were gonna lock you up.

507
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,920
Whoa, watch out for cars.

508
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,700
The goat, the goat.

509
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I've had to talk to someone.

510
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,480
I told Barry everything.

511
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,920
He thought I was certifiable.

512
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,980
But when he heard about the manuscript, I had him.

513
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,920
The fact that I'd written something, even if I couldn't
remember it, was enough for him.

514
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:42,420
He smelled money.

515
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,640
That is maybe evidence, right?

516
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,000
Money?

517
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,160
And he believed that Alice had been kidnapped.

518
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,240
Anything beyond that was another story.

519
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:54,220
I had a midnight appointment with the kidnapper in a place
called Lovers' peak somewhere in elderwood national park the

520
00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:00,920
plan was to rent a cabin i don't like it al i don't like any

Who's Max?

525
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,120
What an airhead.

526
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:31,960
Max Payne?

527
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,780
Jeez, Mr. Takes a swing at everybody.

528
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,540
This is not her fault.

529
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,400
She's a very nice girl and, more importantly, a fan.

530
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,100
Okay, okay.

531
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,700
You didn't tell me.

532
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,520
They were like, wow!

533
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,160
The skeleton of a Colombian mammoth.

534
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,400
submitted to be 14,000 years old was recovered from the La
Brea Tar Pits in 1981.

535
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:04,540
It was donated to the Elderwood National Park in 1998 when
the Colombian mammoth became the, became Washington state

536
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,540
fossil named Bucktooth Charlie since, it has since become
the park's official mascot.

537
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:24,980
Oh, you know, there's a, there's a, there's a, like a,
what's it called, a fossil, my brain today there's a fossil

T-Rex and yeah mold you know what you know and uh And hers

541
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,180
The only one that's in motion is the one outside of dinosaur
in the animal kingdom.

542
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,460
Sue the original used to be in Chicago.

543
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,060
Yeah, there's a couple Sue's now.

544

yourself a ticket to the funny farm wait here okay hold on

they're so cute though i watch a live cam of a deer trough
and they just come up and they're just like chomping down

572
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:26,980
and sometimes they kick each other are deer territorial i
don't really know much about them this is discrimination

573
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:42,680
against deer i agree they can be deer are just jerks i mean
it's really bad if you hit a deer because usually you will

574
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,620
be getting more damage to your car and yourself than them.

575
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,140
Thanks to their museum and animatronic yaps, Minto.

576
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,860

Here, I'll read the rest of it for you.

580
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:07,210
Alan, jump.

581
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,490
Alan, jump.

582
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,430
Alan, I can't jump.

583
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:11,870
I can't jump.

584
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,870
It won't let me.

585
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,390
That's a door I go, thank you.

586
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,510
This one, this looks like a kiwi.

587
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,770
Kind of making me hungry.

588
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,430
Alright, we'll keep going.

589
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,230
Look at that bear.

590
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,650
Look at the size of that guy.

591
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,790
Oh, grizzly bear!

592
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,190
It happened while I was fishing at my usual spot.

593
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:38,070
I guess you could say the deer aren't very dear to the
museum.

594
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,230
I'd stayed out later than I meant to.

595
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,650
Sun was already going down.

596
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,750
Suddenly this huge animal...

597
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,130
Oh!

598
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,740
We have a dog?

599
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:56,840
Oh, no.

600
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,500
Oh, thermos.

601
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,280
Nothing happens to the dog, does it?

602
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,800
Please tell me now.

603
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,490

00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,640
Why are you guys smiling?

606
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,880
It's not a smiling thing.

607
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,880
You should be frowning.

608
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,420
It should be sad.

609
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:29,080
Whoa.

610
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,240

trouble.

633
00:43:56,330 --> 00:44:07,810
I love that the peak is surrounded by a mysterious fog, a
very ominous silent heel fog in that town.

634
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:09,990
Silent heel.

635
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:12,850

The guy that's gonna steal the moon?

668
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,540
This reminds me of a cabin I stayed in once.

669
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,300
And everyone in my family had a dream that somebody...

670
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,740
was hanging from the rafters.

671
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:54,460
Creepy.

672
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,930
I guess I leave then.

673
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,410
Okay, I think I remember.

674
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,290
Oh, wait.

675
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,430
Oh, I was searching for stuff.

676
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:14,370
Okay, so I think this is to kind of dodge if I'm walking.

677
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,250
Or is it to run?

678
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:19,650
Actually, I'm not sure.

679
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,070
There was a dodge, though, wasn't there?

680
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,560
I guess No, this is just running.

681
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:28,820
Oh, I have stamina.

682
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,580
Hold on.

683
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,070
Run and dodge are the same button.

684
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,070
I don't remember.

685
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,890
I guess I can't...

686
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:47,990
I can't get my gun out yet or anything.

687
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,010
I'm just nervous about not knowing what to do, you know.

688
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:53,330
I'm trying to figure it out soon, but the game isn't...

689
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:56,510
The game is literally not allowing me to try anything.

690
00:48:58,610 --> 00:48:59,810
I die?

691
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,410
I die.

692
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:04,710
At least know how to focus my light.

693
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,790
Oh my god, it's already spooky.

694
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:14,030
I'm knocking over everything.

695
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,650
Let's see.

696
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:22,470
It won't even let me change guns.

697
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,690
So do I have a gun?

698
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:25,990
Is a better question.

699
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:28,090
I'm not sure.

700
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,530
There's a Hot tub!

701
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,610
For me and Barry!

702
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:35,650
Let's go.

703
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,110
Spooky well.

704
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:45,250
Very out of place plastic chairs.

705
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:47,290
Let's move these.

706
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:53,670
I don't think you can be five feet apart in that tiny thing.

707
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,510
I think you have to be all over each other.

708
00:49:59,070 --> 00:49:59,510
A little.

709
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:14,220
like i guess it'll just go then i was looking for a
manuscript but i don't see anything either did i pick up

710
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:20,700
anymore uh that i didn't read let me oh here we go the
kidnapper fired his gun one last time uh-oh the shadow

711
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:27,180
vanished into the darkness it had come from see nothing to
it wake wait what the thought of alice in his hands was

712
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:33,440
revolting we stood on the wooden platform of lover's peak
the waterfall in the mountain behind us the lights of the

713
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,640
radio mass blinking red in the heights above.

714
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,060
I fought with the urge to take a swing.

715
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,680
Force myself to speak.

716
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:41,660
Let's cut the act now.

717
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:43,020
Where's my wife?

718
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,340
Where's my wife?

719
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,260
Wait, you're forcing yourself to speak?

720
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,020
I don't think...

721
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,560
I think you speak very...

722
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:52,920
I think you're very excited to speak, uh...

723
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,720
Mr. Wake.

724
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,760
I think you'll speak at every opera...

725
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:56,080
Ugh!

726
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,400
Wait here, Al.

727
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:59,080
I'll hold down the fort.

728
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,040
I'll be with you in spirit every step of the way, Al.

729
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,240
What?

730
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,980
Wait, what do you mean by that?

731
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,700
Um, why can't I hear you from all the way over?

732
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:09,460
Oh, you're downstairs?

733
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:14,080
He really locked the door!

734
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,580
Oh my god, there he goes!

735
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,440
Okay, what if I...

736
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,520
For God's...

737
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:24,260
Oh my...

738
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,360
I have my gun now.

739
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,080
Okay.

740
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:29,860
Oh shoot, how do I...

741
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,280
Oh!

742
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:46,640
Sorry!

743
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,140
Sorry!

744
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,560
Yeah, I lost my flare and my shotgun.

745
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,400
No!

746
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,060
Okay.

747
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,940
I remember how to use the flashlight.

748
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,640
I see the manuscript down there.

749
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,560
Checkpoint reached, okay.

750
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,780
Let's see what this bad boy says.

751
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,240
Barry doubts wake stage.

752
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,100
Barry had never gotten along with Alice.

753
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,740
But he knew Alan loved her with an almost friend.

754
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,640
frightening intensity.

755
00:52:18,340 --> 00:52:19,900
And now something had happened to Alice.

756
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,140
And here was Al armed with a gun and saying things people
got put in bad at sea.

757
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,240
Get that guy a fresh pair of pairs.

758
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,280
It was as if this friend had experienced a massive psychotic
episode and was now totally disconnected from reality.

759
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,100
It scared the shit out of Barry.

760
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:36,540
What?

761
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,760
Don't be scared.

762
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:38,920
What?

763
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,240
More plastic.

764
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,240
More plastic chairs.

765
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,900
Belongs to Virgil, yeah.

766
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,080
Alright.

767
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:48,960
Guys.

768
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,520
I knew I should have gone to the cops.

769
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,060
This wasn't the smartest thing I'd ever done.

770
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,640
But I was still angry with Barry for trying to talk me out
of it.

771
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,620
These people had called me right in the sheriff's station.

772
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:02,380
The cops wouldn't scare them.

773
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,760
And they had Alice.

774
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,300
Are these the same kind of birds that will attack me?

775
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:08,540
They sure look like it.

776
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,440
These look like the kind of birds that are going to come
swooping down on me.

777
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,300
I have a feeling.

778
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:19,760
This game's a little spooky, guys.

779
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:24,620
And I wasted some bullets on accident.

780
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,160
That's a safe area right there.

781
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,040
Oh, what is over?

782
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:30,160
Oh, my God.

783
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,520
Oh, my God.

784
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,340
What is that?

785
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,820
Hello?

786
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,560
Hello?

787
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,900
I'm scared.

788
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,900
This is such a nice area though.

789
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:00,300
Wow, the view is kind of crazy.

790
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,660
Okay, let's go upstairs, see if I can grab anything here.

791
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,920
There's something inside.

792
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,580
I'm just breaking and entering, sorry, excuse me.

793
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,500
Turn the lights on.

794
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,640
Yes.

795
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,740
Welcome back to the show, folks.

796
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,380
As promised, our very own Dr. Nelson has just parked his
rear end in the studio.

797
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,580
Dr. Nelson.

798
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,900
What's your Deerfest plan like?

799
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,160
My plan?

800
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,260
You'll make it sound a lot more organized than I ever seem
to manage.

801
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,610
Wasn't that funny?

802
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:47,190
I'm getting a little too much wickety to do much more than
that, you know?

803
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:49,090
Oh, tell me about it.

804
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,090

Geezer?

827

It's getting stopped so quickly.

829
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:41,930
As soon as it started.

830
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,460

Whoa, what happened here?

854
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,670
Oh, that don't look good.

855
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,750
Um, kick?

856
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,610
Okay.

857
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:10,610
Kick, kick it.

858
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:11,550
Allen, kick!

859
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,010
Allen!

860
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,470
What happened in here?

861
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,470
A bear?

862
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:22,750
Maybe?

863
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,470
The light switch doesn't work either.

864
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,270
Open!

865
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:30,510
Nothing?

866
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:32,230
Okay.

867
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,150
Use?

868
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:37,290
Oh, yay!

869
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:37,790
TBE!

870
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:39,370
TAB!

871
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:39,670
TASME!

872
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:40,730
Welcome to Bamboo Ship!

873
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:41,830
Thank you!

874
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,930
The cancer and cure of civilization!

875
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:48,770
But some crimes are impossible to punish.

876
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:50,430
Especially...

877
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:51,710
What is with the dust in there?

878
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,190
Little little loo!

879
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:56,710
Tonight's episode.

880
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:00,330
Ooh.

881
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:06,920
Opposite of hag, are...

882
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,680
Are what?

883
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,460
Do we?

884
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:09,900
No.

885
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,520
Talking about for a guy.

886
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,860
You're confessing to killing that guy, huh?

887
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:14,700
Why?

888
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,060
And he's coming?

889
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,180
Yeah, but why would you do that?

890
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:20,640
I mean, you're a nice guy.

891
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,320
Normal.

892
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:22,920
Took a kid to a soccer game.

893
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,400
So how come at the game, you pick a guy...

894
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,080
His voice does not...

895
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,860
Does not hit him.

896
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,740
...repeatedly with the weapon of choice being apparent.

897
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:41,120
of bare fists oh wow that sentence really flows huh it's unc
maybe you're not the literary type wouldn't it be geezer you

898
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:50,620

would a guy like you do him like that i didn't like his face

899
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:56,520

you took him to the game the white shirt is on the dead guy

902
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:24,000

think that's in any way relevant to me I had plenty of time

903
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:32,920
to talk to my boy before the cops arrived you know he won't
stop screaming am I right you think he's gonna be okay what

904
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:56,840

905
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,060
What?

906
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,320
The first one was funny.

907
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,260
This one was silly too.

908
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,160
Shapeshifter?

909
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:19,440
Freaky.

910
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,380
Are they coming for me?

911
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,740
Oh, I can kind of like...

912
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:36,020
Oh, I am getting them though.

913
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,620
I was at... Oh, for a second.

914
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:41,520
Come on.

915
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:42,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

916
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,220
I'm taking care of them.

917
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,580
It's my birthday today too!

918
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,400
Just wanted to say a quick thank you for all the fun streams
and performances.

919
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,920
I always have the night to see Etsy!

920
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:00,900
Happy birthday!

921
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:05,230
Sorry, I swallowed my spear wrong.

922
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:07,470
Bad acting though, Oscar worthy.

923
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:08,190
Truly.

924
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:10,250
It was so good.

925
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,470
A car.

926
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:14,830
Abandoned car.

927
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,410
Wait, so this is the walking trail.

928
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:25,430
Can I call back Barry, Barry, how are you?

929
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:26,290
I miss you.

930
01:02:26,370 --> 01:02:27,610
Oh, more birds.

931
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,850
Are these dangerous, danger birds?

932
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:31,150
No, no danger birds.

933
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:32,710
Checkpoint reached.

934
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:34,830
They were reading my manuscript.

935
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:36,930
What'd they think?

936
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:40,430
Rusty dying?

937
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:47,030
When the visitor center was heavy with an awful smell, as if
some rotten drowned thing had crawled up from its grave.

938
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:48,910
Rusty kept coughing blood.

939
01:02:49,410 --> 01:02:52,210
My eyes were drawn to the twisted shape of his broken leg.

940
01:02:52,690 --> 01:03:01,670
attack had been vicious max whined in his oh wait rusty is
the guy that with fear and terror he gasped mr wake it

Rusty, take him.

946
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:32,990
What?

947
01:03:33,250 --> 01:03:33,810

948
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:34,610

949
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:36,170
Please, help me.

950
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,530
What is happening?

951
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:38,650
I'm coming.

952
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:40,390
I'm running.

953
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:47,780
What's that sound?

954
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:49,820
I don't want to think about it.

955
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,480
I'm just going.

956
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:53,060
Anybody?

957
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:54,420
Help me!

958
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:55,700
Rusty!

959
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:57,960
Whoa, holy cow.

960
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,440
Where are you?

961
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,120
Rusty?

962
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,060
Rusty.

963
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:02,660
I'm...

964
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:06,160
Oh, hold on.

965
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,560
There's something shining over here.

966
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:08,620
I'm helping.

967
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:09,540
And one second.

968
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:11,700
What's the cover?

969
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:12,420
Hold on.

970
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:13,060
One second.

971
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,800
Rusty attacked by the dark presence.

972
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:21,800
The visitor center was sturdy, but the impact turned the
front of the building into splinters.

973
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,940
Rusty was thrown across the lobby like a ragdoll and hit the
firewall hard.

974
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:30,180
It didn't hurt until he tried to move and saw his leg bend
the wrong way.

975
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,800
Felt the broken ribs stabbing him on the inside.

976
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:40,100
Rusty howled in pain and fear Suddenly afraid to die alone
Oh no, he won't die alone I mean, he's not gonna die at all,

977
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:48,800
I'll be right there I'm coming I'm coming I'm coming Wait,
how's Charlie?

978
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:56,220
In perfect condition, okay Oh my god Oh, Rusty

979
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,580
Mr. Wake Hello?

980
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,780
Oh, hell.

981
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,080
It happened.

982
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,140
Just the way it was on that page.

983
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,460
I found it.

984
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:11,020
True.

985
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:12,740
It knew.

986
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,020
So dark.

987
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,920
It'll come back for me.

988
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:17,860
You must.

989
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:19,280
The lights.

990
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:20,620
In the office.

991
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,340
I have the key.

992
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:23,860
Okay, Rusty.

993
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:24,880
Hang on.

994
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,060
I'll be right back.

995
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,020
Oh.

996
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,080
Rusty had found a page from the manuscript.

997
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,680
It would help me understand what had happened.

998
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:35,140
Are you okay, boy?

999
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:36,900
Shh.

1000
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:37,940
Good boy.

1001
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:38,960
Oh.

1002
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,580
Charlie, okay?

1003
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,860
Charlie is, like, in peak condition.

1004
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,100
Charlie has no damages.

1005
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:46,920
It's awesome.

1006
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:47,840
This one.

1007
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,120
It is this one, right?

1008
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:51,160
Wait.

1009
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:52,960
Get the lights on.

1010
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,540
He said in the room, no?

1011
01:05:58,980 --> 01:05:59,960
Was it over here?

1012
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,640
No?

1013
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:06,040
Oh?

1014
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,260
What's this?

1015
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:08,920
Oh, nothing.

1016
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:12,140
Oh, in the other building.

1017
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,160
Oh, okay, okay.

1018
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,680
Oh, cross the street.

1019
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:22,340
The office?

1020
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:22,900
Oh, okay.

1021
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:29,300
The only way to make sure that Rusty was safe was to get the
power running and the lights back on.

1022
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,860
Okay, I'm scared.

1023
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:33,960
I'm scared.

01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,320

01:07:28,660 --> 01:07:29,140
It looks like...

1035
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,080
I hear something in there.

1036
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,260
I hear something in there.

1037
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:36,140
Sounds like a...

1038
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:50,320
like a scritchy scratch it's kind of nice sounding actually
oh here oh I was too late someone had destroyed the circuit

1039
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:53,880
breaker no there was no way to get the lights back uh-uh

1040
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:06,880
Rusty what's going on over there

1041
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,090
That tree wasn't fallen before, was it?

1042
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:25,150
The ground was covered with oily patches that looked like
liquid darkness.

1043
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:29,540
Wait!

1044
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:30,240
The dog!

1045
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:34,280
Oh no, my god.

1046
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:35,800
Oh shoot.

1047
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:58,930
Very important.

1048
01:09:00,070 --> 01:09:01,490
Hold on, I'm getting rid of this oil.

1049
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,490
Whatever the hell this is.

1050
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:06,450
Max!

1051
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:08,750
Max!

1052
01:09:11,490 --> 01:09:14,910
Something had torn a mammoth-sized hole in the wall.

1053
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,410
Please don't feed the animals.

1054
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:22,350
A mammoth size, you say.

1055
01:09:23,690 --> 01:09:29,390
Fishing is only permitted for those visitors who purchase a
park fishing license.

1056
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:31,190
Is that Rusty?

1057
01:09:32,430 --> 01:09:33,470
Is Rusty possessed?

1058
01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:36,190
Rusty?

1059
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:39,330
Rusty?

1060
01:09:41,830 --> 01:09:42,470
Max?

1061
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,330
Rusty?

1062
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:45,690
Max?

1063
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:54,560
What?

1064
01:09:57,940 --> 01:09:58,220
Oh!

1065
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,200
Mark Ranger's instructions?

1066
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,020
Not all kinds.

1067
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,140
Oh, he's... Rusty, no!

1068
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:05,980
Rusty, no!

1069
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:09,680
Two bears and wolves!

1070
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,340
Never approach any other world war to go closer than...

1071
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,340
Oh my god.

1072
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:23,360
Oh my god.

1073
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:24,300
Oh my god.

1074
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:24,640
Ah!

1075
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,760
It is against the law.

1076
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:32,520
To remove any natural arms or historical remains.

1077
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,720
Run apart.

1078
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,980
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

1079
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,720
I forgot I can...

1080
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:48,700
Okay, we got him.

1081
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,280
Rusty!

1082
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:51,980
Rusty is...

1083
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,160
Oh!

1084
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:52,780
Oh, shoot.

1085
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:55,040
Oh, man.

1086
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,300
There's more guys coming in.

1087
01:10:58,260 --> 01:10:58,380
Hey!

1088
01:10:58,600 --> 01:10:59,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1089
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:00,860
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1090
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,100
Let's not do that.

1091
01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:09,200
Reload, reload, reload.

1092
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:10,540
Yeah!

1093
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,340
Okay, I'm remembering how to play the game.

1094
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:15,680
Rusty?

1095
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:18,560
Rusty, you...

1096
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,800
I'm remembering how to play!

1097
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:24,620
Yeah.

1098
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,280
Sorry if it's really loud though.

1099
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,120
I'm like trying, I can't really adjust the...

1100
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:30,960
Oh yeah!

1101
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,300
We got our... Yeah!

1102
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,180
We got the...

1103
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:38,020
um, the thing full of ammo.

1104
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,580
The dumpster of ammo!

1105
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,180
Yeah!

1106
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:44,380
Volume's okay?

1107
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,000
Okay, cool.

1108
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:45,920
Thank you.

1109
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,260
Yeah, because, um...

1110
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,020
What was it?

1111
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,320
The... Usually the voice...

1112
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:53,820
Oh, wait.

1113
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:54,840
What kind of ammo is this?

1114
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:57,040
Well, let me pick it up.

1115
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:58,080
Oh, it's milk.

1116
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,800
What kind of ammo could it be?

1117
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,520
Okay, I don't think there's anything else in here.

1118
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,300
I think we gotta go where they came from.

1119
01:12:21,460 --> 01:12:21,800
Oh!

1120
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:22,460
Oh,

1121
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:31,820
it's not this darkness again that we experienced in the
very, very beginning of the game, is it?

1122
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:32,880
Checkpoint?

1123
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,380
Let's go.

1124
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,640
Like... Oh, maybe.

1125
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:53,930
This way?

1126
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,450
It's really bright.

1127
01:12:57,310 --> 01:12:57,830
Oh.

1128
01:12:58,650 --> 01:12:58,870
Oh, shi-moshi.

1129
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:05,470
The ammo for your buds.

1130
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:07,990
Forget about it, Barry.

1131
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,810
It's just me going crazy.

1132
01:13:10,130 --> 01:13:10,590
Oh, jeez.

1133
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:12,250
Oh, jeez.

1134
01:13:12,690 --> 01:13:13,510
You're not crazy.

1135
01:13:14,070 --> 01:13:15,010
I wish you were crazy.

1136
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:15,590
$100.

1137
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:16,410
But you're not crazy.

1138
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,210
Ow, be careful.

1139
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:19,850
Stay in the cabin.

1140
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:21,510
Don't open the door for anyone.

1141
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:22,430
I mean it.

1142
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:24,430
Yeah.

1143
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,810
Not even for me.

1144
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:28,810
I'm crazy.

1145
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:31,470
I'm crazy.

1146
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:34,230
Okay.

1147
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:35,950
What do we got here?

1148
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:40,170
Rusty's final thoughts.

1149
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:43,210
In that last instant of consciousness, Rusty thought about
Rose.

1150
01:13:44,050 --> 01:13:45,130
He was older than she was.

1151
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,990
Rose was barely out of her teens.

1152
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:48,630
But she made him feel young.

1153
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:49,230
Oh.

1154
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,430
He still wore the ring.

1155
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:53,890
Oh.

1156
01:13:57,190 --> 01:14:03,290
Oh, that's... Wait, wasn't he at the diner in the first
episode?

1157
01:14:03,490 --> 01:14:04,050
Oh, no.

1158
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:07,090
Oh, Rusty.

1159
01:14:10,230 --> 01:14:13,450
Rusty, I know your marriage is exactly that.

1160
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:16,910
A little rusty, but...

1161
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:17,650
Come on, guy.

1162
01:14:22,130 --> 01:14:24,230
Just get the divorce.

1163
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:24,830
It's okay.

1164
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:27,010
Just get the divorce!

1165
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:29,610
keep going.

1166
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:34,290
We're going to Lover's Peak, but it looks like we're going
downhill.

1167
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:35,390
What's this?

1168
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:37,230
Oh, nice.

1169
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:38,930
Okay,

1170
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:42,400
good.

1171
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:46,140
How do we get into the peak if we're going down?

1172
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:51,640
Oh, it's that way.

1173
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:52,560
Okay, wait.

1174
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:55,820
There's a lot of checkpoints in this game.

1175
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:57,840
At least he died with dignity.

1176
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,620
I'm not complaining, by the way.

1177
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:01,800
Yeah, I don't know if he did.

1178
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:08,620
Lover's Peak was at the far end of the Entering Moonshine
Cave.

1179
01:15:08,940 --> 01:15:09,760
Wait, can we go in?

1180
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,620
Oh, there's a hidden.

1181
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:17,900
Whoa!

1182
01:15:18,620 --> 01:15:20,140
Whoa, we're in the cave, guys!

1183
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,840
There's a hidden thing in here.

1184
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,120
Oh, this is scary.

1185
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:35,800
Sight of frequent bootlegger activity.

1186
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:37,720
throughout the Prohibition.

1187
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:41,000
This way?

1188
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:43,680
Where at?

1189
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,440
Oh, this thing?

1190
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:46,960
Is that a shotgun?

1191
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:48,640
Yippee!

1192
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,420
We got a flare gun even!

1193
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:58,940
Wow!

1194
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:03,000
It was worth...

1195
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,080
It was worth it.

1196
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,820
What's all that noise, though?

1197
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:10,720
You hear that?

1198
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:11,800
It's kind of spooky.

1199
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:14,040
I only have two bullets, though.

1200
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,220
Okay, okay.

1201
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:20,640
Read.

1202
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:26,320
Oh, it was mostly used for a temporary storage of alcohol
smuggled from Canada.

1203
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:30,420
But at times, alcohol was also distilled on the premises.

1204
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:36,080
No, I think it's the birds that I'm hearing up there.

1205
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:38,460
What the heck is that?

1206
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,040
What the heck is that?

1207
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,200
I think it's just all the birds that I'm hearing.

1208
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:45,380
It's not the secret.

1209
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,020
Whispering.

1210
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,540
Wait, what's over here?

1211
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:50,000
Anything?

1212
01:16:51,660 --> 01:16:51,940
Nothing.

1213
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,500
Just fake light.

1214
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,100
We can leave.

1215
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:03,620
There was another pathway I meant to go earlier back at
the...

1216
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,300
But it's okay.

1217
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:07,340
I think I missed it, but that's alright.

1218
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:10,800
Ha ha ha.

1219
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,740
Kaka.

1220
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:15,840
Them birds.

1221
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:18,200
All right.

1222
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,180
Lovers peak.

1223
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,780
Ulla la la.

1224
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,200
Lovers peak.

1225
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:31,580
I keep thinking they mean like don't,

1226
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:37,560
you know, like don't.

1227
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,160
Why did that just fall?

1228
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,320
Why did that just fall?

1229
01:17:41,340 --> 01:17:41,780
Ah!

1230
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:42,840
Oh my god.

1231
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:43,940
Wait, what just happened?

1232
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,100
Why did the camera do that?

1233
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:45,880
Okay, thank you!

1234
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,620
I don't need your assistance, I know where they are!

1235
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:51,440
Oh.

1236
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,310
There's three of them!

1237
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:04,970
Ouch!

1238
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:05,590
Ouch!

1239
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:12,640
Oh my gosh.

1240
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:15,380
That scared the heck out of me.

1241
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:15,920
Ah!

1242
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,120
The guy came from behind.

1243
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:20,480
Oh.

1244
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:21,380
Hello?

1245
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,500
You assholes!

1246
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,920
Oh, there's a light down there.

1247
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:33,900
We gotta...

1248
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:34,740
You heal!

1249
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:36,200
Not so bad in this game.

1250
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:36,900
It's actually...

1251
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:42,950
Let's reload while I'm at it too.

1252
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:50,730
Attacked from... from behind at Lover's Peak is crazy.

1253
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:52,170
We're not even there yet!

1254
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:55,090
We're not- we're not at Lover's Peak!

1255
01:18:56,250 --> 01:18:57,950
Do you think I'll meet my lover there?

1256
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,810
Oh, Lover, my lover!

1257
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:03,050
What's over here though?

1258
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:05,350
There's another pathway.

1259
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:12,870
Unless, this is the pathway I saw earlier.

1260
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,670
No, it's not.

1261
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,070
Manuscript.

1262
01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:28,170
This game really rewards you for exploring.

1263
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:29,870
Barry meets Rose!

1264
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:34,950
Nobody in Bright Falls seemed to know where Al was, but
Rose, the waitress at the diner, had seen him.

1265
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:41,450
From what Barry could tell, pretty much fell off the face of
the earth when he left the diner rose was just the kind of

1266
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:48,330
fan lovers plural but she really tried to help she was smart
too knew a lot about what was going on in the town knew a

1267
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:55,770
lot about al even knew who barry was oh barry liked her that
was no big surprise when it came to women barry and al

1268
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:08,190
rarely saw oh sorry whoops rarely saw eye to eye why is rose
why is everybody obsessed with rose a temptress.

1269
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,220
I thought this was...

1270
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:17,540
Okay, maybe this isn't the pathway I saw earlier.

1271
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:20,700
That I mentioned that I missed earlier.

1272
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:27,000
There's not many people in the town.

1273
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:30,380
I guess that's fair.

1274
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:34,240
Who?

1275
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,580
Who's here?

1276
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:37,080
Where?

1277
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:38,380
Show yourself!

1278
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:39,540
Where are you?

1279
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:40,500
I'm scared!

1280
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:41,840
Where are you?

1281
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:43,360
Where are you?

1282
01:20:44,060 --> 01:20:44,740
I was scared!

1283
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:46,020
Where are you?

1284
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:48,460
Where are you?

1285
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,470
There's guns here.

1286
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,590
Shotgun ammo?

1287
01:21:14,990 --> 01:21:15,550
Take that out.

1288
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:17,890
And a shotgun ammo?

1289
01:21:17,890 --> 01:21:18,750
Pick that up.

1290
01:21:20,350 --> 01:21:21,030
Nice.

1291
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:21,990
Um.

1292
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:26,550
Is it just the ambiance, I can't tell, quite honestly.

1293
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:29,810
It seems too intense, right?

1294
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,590
Or is it just the ambiance?

1295
01:21:44,450 --> 01:21:44,890
Okay.

1296
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:48,230
Let's just keep going.

1297
01:21:50,050 --> 01:21:51,730
Hopefully I don't get ambushed.

1298
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:53,110
Please!

1299
01:21:54,050 --> 01:21:55,270
Wait, I need more signs.

1300
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:56,190
Where's Lover's Peak?

1301
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:57,890
The Great.

1302
01:21:58,190 --> 01:21:58,630
AHHHHH!

1303
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:06,670
Oh, they get... they get stronger, huh?

1304
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:11,530
Oh my god, wait, oh!

1305
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,790
Yeah!

1306
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:18,350
Okay, I don't want it to be on my shotgun, though.

1307
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:18,810
There we go.

1308
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:19,830
Oh, here you are.

1309
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:27,140
Ah!

1310
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:28,000
Ah!

1311
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:28,480
Ouch!

1312
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:35,430
Oh!

1313
01:22:35,970 --> 01:22:37,090
Yeah, don't throw your thing.

1314
01:22:38,010 --> 01:22:38,690
Oh my gosh.

1315
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:45,870
The gray old one.

1316
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:47,590
That's what they call me.

1317
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:52,070
I'm getting spooked.

1318
01:22:52,350 --> 01:22:53,230
Wait, is this lover's peak?

1319
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:54,130
Where are we?

1320
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:55,990
These are the hiking trails.

1321
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,020
Yeah!

1322
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:17,960
Where's the other guy?

1323
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:18,280
You.

1324
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:19,500
Oh, shoot.

1325
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:21,220
Yeah.

1326
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:22,340
Yeah.

1327
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:23,060
Oh, shoot.

1328
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:24,280
Oh, my God.

1329
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,850
Where's lover's peak?

1330
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:39,810
I guess we go down the trail.

1331
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:45,920
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1332
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:47,780
Yeah, I need more signs.

1333
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:49,560
Come on, gamer paint.

1334
01:23:51,800 --> 01:23:52,600
Another one!

1335
01:23:57,820 --> 01:23:58,220
Oh

1336
01:24:01,980 --> 01:24:02,800
my god, that was close.

1337
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:13,390
Holy cow.

1338
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:15,090
Oh my god, I'm almost out of ammo.

1339
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:16,050
Wait!

1340
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,190
This is bad!

1341
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:18,930
I'm almost out of ammo!

1342
01:24:24,680 --> 01:24:25,300
I'm running.

1343
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:28,480
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm
running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

1344
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:33,940
No!

1345
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:34,620
You!

1346
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,480
Start, please!

1347
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:40,400
Okay.

1348
01:24:45,940 --> 01:24:47,240
Alan, run.

1349
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:49,080
Everyone's a critic.

1350
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:50,100
Wait, wait.

1351
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,340
What'd you say?

1352
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,840
These are all of Alan Wake's critics.

1353
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:00,340
Hey, I didn't like the way you...

1354
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:01,540

1357
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,100
Okay, two things that we definitely needed.

1358
01:25:44,810 --> 01:25:46,110
What's going on here?

1359
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:49,810
They axed the phone!

1360
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:53,490
All they said is I must ask you a question!

1361
01:25:55,830 --> 01:26:00,670
Local rider visits small town for a vacay, proceeds to wipe
out half the population.

1362
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:04,930
Yeah, sounds about right.

1363
01:26:06,150 --> 01:26:07,970
How far is lover's peak?

1364
01:26:08,170 --> 01:26:08,830
My god!

1365
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,050
At this point, every level...

1366
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:16,170
lover is gonna you know what they call it lover's peak
because they you have to go through the trials and the

1367
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:21,250
tribulations of finding it you have to test your
relationship it's like you know how they say that couples

1368
01:26:21,250 --> 01:26:26,730
that go on vacation together or something is like the
ultimate test of your relationship that's exactly what this

1369
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:40,900
is all the shadowy enemies are actually alan's family what
it's not the destination it's the journey exactly this is

1370
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:46,600
the true test to make that you are compatible for your
relationship I turned the corner afraid of what the

1371
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:53,460
flashlight's beam might reveal suddenly a roughly painted
symbol of a torch glowed in the light oh behind it hidden by

1372
01:26:53,460 --> 01:27:01,320
a rock sat a battered metal trunk yeah yeah yeah it was here
for a reason pack was yeah I found these before ammo things

1373
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:06,840
you need to make it through the darkness of the night
something left behind by someone who knew what I knew and

1374
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:15,120
more that is true who's Wake sees the torch symbol.

1375
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:17,440
That's not even like...

1376
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,560
Is it part of the lore?

1377
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:20,120
Actually, it might be.

1378
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:21,280
Huh.

1379
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,840
I forgot what... There was an easy mode for this game,
wasn't there?

1380
01:27:26,740 --> 01:27:27,540
Bear alert!

1381
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:28,940
Whoa, what was that?

1382
01:27:30,140 --> 01:27:31,100
Uh, did you see that?

1383
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:36,060
Wait, did you guys see the building that was behind my head?

1384
01:27:37,260 --> 01:27:38,280
Wait a second, what was that?

1385
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,540
I wonder what it is.

1386
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,470
The music is killing me.

1387
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:03,030
Checkpoint reached.

1388
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,750
Am I going to get attacked by a bear?

1389
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,170
No kidding.

1390
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:08,930
Lover's peak!

1391
01:28:11,390 --> 01:28:11,910
Oh, lava!

1392
01:28:17,020 --> 01:28:18,620
That was Bigfoot.

Wait.

1403
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:07,960
Did I say a yellow?

1404
01:30:08,220 --> 01:30:08,400
No.

1405
01:30:08,680 --> 01:30:10,020
I saw a plant.

1406
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:14,620

I'm the creator of Deadly Premonition.

1409
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,600
I don't know this, actually.

1410
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:22,240
Sounds funny, though.

1411
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:25,080
Thank you for the Silver Talos.

1412
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:28,220
Oh.

1413
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:29,440
Oh.

1414
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,660
No lovers allowed.

1415
01:30:37,240 --> 01:30:38,000
Oh, man.

1416
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:41,140
Always making me go the long way.

1417
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:45,800
I only have two batteries left.

1418
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,000
This is not good.

1419
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,480
The game's getting pretty intense.

1420
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,140
What is this?

1421
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,920
It just said, oh, it's just a log.

1422
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:59,980
That dates from 1846.

1423
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:01,720
The year of the Oregon Trail.

1424
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,020
Oh, wow.

1425
01:31:04,340 --> 01:31:05,060
The tree ring.

1426
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:08,380
The tree this ring was cut from started growing in 1846.

1427
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,100
Other notable events marked on the rings.

1428
01:31:12,940 --> 01:31:13,420
Washington Treaty.

1429
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:16,240
No, Washington Territory was formed.

1430
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:18,980
The founding of the Bright Falls Mining Co.

1431
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,460
in the town itself in 1878.

1432
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:22,500
Good.

1433
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:23,620
So welcome back.

1434
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:24,280
Thank you.

1435
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:27,620
Washington was granted statehood.

1436
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,780
Tree damaged in a forest fire.

1437
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,380
The Bright Falls Mining Co.

1438
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:35,440
its doors after a volcanic eruption below Cauldron Lake.

1439
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,300
Mount St. Helens erupts.

1440
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:38,520
Tree felled.

1441
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:38,940
Damn.

1442
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:42,880
The tree survived a forest fire.

1443
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:47,900
Two volcanic eruptions and falls over because of a storm.

1444
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,120
That's pretty tragic.

1445
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:56,500
Wait a second.

1446
01:31:56,660 --> 01:31:57,660
I wasn't supposed to go over here?

1447
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:03,050
Is there anything in the dumpster, please?

1448
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:04,010
Say yes.

1449
01:32:04,290 --> 01:32:04,510
No.

1450
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:05,410
Dang.

1451
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:07,450
Um.

1452
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:17,660
Yeah, it survives so much just for a storm to take it out.

1453
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:23,350
Oh.

1454
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:24,530
Uh.

1455
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:30,530
Hey, Alan, think I need you to have a genius author idea,
please.

1456
01:32:31,530 --> 01:32:31,810
Oh, wait.

1457
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:32,870
Can I go over the fence?

1458
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:34,450
Oh, I can!

1459
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:35,810
What?

1460
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:38,590
I had the genius thought.

1461
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:44,310
Sees Mito streaming while I'm working in the office, clicks
in immediately met with a scream.

1462
01:32:46,510 --> 01:32:47,390
Solid Snake!

1463
01:32:47,550 --> 01:32:48,370
Thank you for the super chat.

1464
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,810
Good luck with work!

1465
01:32:51,550 --> 01:32:52,430
Alan Dink.

1466
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:55,410
Alan Reed.

1467
01:32:56,770 --> 01:32:57,650
Nightingale's arrival.

1468
01:32:57,990 --> 01:33:00,430
Agent Nightingale didn't want to be in Bright Falls.

1469
01:33:01,130 --> 01:33:02,710
These little communities revolted him.

1470
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,090
Oh my gosh, no, thank you for the pink!

1471
01:33:05,070 --> 01:33:06,110
One second, I'll read it in a second.

1472
01:33:06,170 --> 01:33:09,290
He now knew that impossible horrors lurked behind the
storefronts and smiles.

1473
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:15,370
He desperately wanted to turn the car around and just drive
until he passed out or ran out of road and booze.

1474
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:25,110
but he had a job to do he had a rider to catch at any cost
um hello why are we catching me some context since i didn't

1477
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,490
Thank you for the context.

1478
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,450
Well, I'm glad you're okay.

1479
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:57,570
That your co-worker didn't cause any harm to you or anyone
else.

1480
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,570
Where are we?

1481
01:34:00,210 --> 01:34:01,070
Lovers peak.

1482
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:04,350
We're so far from where we started.

1483
01:34:07,310 --> 01:34:08,990
Recovered by card and bamboo ship.

1484
01:34:09,050 --> 01:34:10,570
Let's go have a nice dream and keep going.

1485
01:34:10,570 --> 01:34:11,050
Guys!

1486
01:34:11,070 --> 01:34:15,230
Oh my god, well, I'm glad you got your card back.

1487
01:34:15,450 --> 01:34:17,430
That's more important, I'd say.

1488
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,070
Have a nice day!

1489
01:34:23,590 --> 01:34:24,630
Thank you!

1490
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:31,680
Burgers or pizza, Minto?

1491
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:32,900
Always burgers.

1492
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,000
Alright, here we go.

1493
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,900
Are we gonna get attacked by birds while we're in here?

1494
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:50,750
I'm vigilant Alan

1495
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:14,340

1496
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:32,290

Sorry.

1499
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:37,890
It's all I got players will keep the bastards away Okay

1500
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:44,040
Friend!

1501
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:45,300
Oh my gosh.

1502
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:46,120
You can see them too?

1503
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,820
Hell of course I see them.

1504
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:48,860
Come on, we gotta move.

1505
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:49,620
Okay, hold on.

1506
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:49,960
Why?

1507
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:50,620
Why?

1508
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,180
Because that's the way the story goes.

1509
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,000
Yeah, but...

1510
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,600
Let's move.

1511
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:55,480
Okay.

1512
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,660
I lost my gun back there.

1513
01:35:56,900 --> 01:35:57,300
I did?

1514
01:35:57,460 --> 01:35:58,700
Oh, I've got a gun.

1515
01:35:58,920 --> 01:35:59,240
Oh, shoot.

1516
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,800
Just keep that light steady on him.

1517
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:01,440
R.V.

1518
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:04,380
You do?

1519
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,740
He'd been on the ferry when I first arrived here with Alice.

1520
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:07,480
Oh, what is this guy?

1521
01:36:08,100 --> 01:36:10,360
We were headed in the direction of Lover's Peak.

1522
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,520
There was no way this was a coincidence.

1523
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:14,220
He was the kidnapper.

1524
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:15,560
Come on, Wake.

1525
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:16,860
He was the kidnapper.

1526
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,300
Wait a second.

1527
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:19,240
You set him up and I'll knock him down, Wake.

1528
01:36:19,480 --> 01:36:20,780
I don't think that's it.

1529
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,180
Guy who robbed me last night.

1530
01:36:24,700 --> 01:36:25,280
Wait, oh my gosh.

1531
01:36:52,360 --> 01:36:53,260
I'm gonna die?

1532
01:36:53,860 --> 01:36:54,740
Um, can you help me?

1533
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:58,440
Oh, what's here?

1534
01:36:58,540 --> 01:36:59,160
What's going on?

1535
01:37:00,680 --> 01:37:02,100
Uh, oh, visual glitch?

1536
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,660
Uh, I think I'm...

1537
01:37:03,660 --> 01:37:03,820
Wait.

1538
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,000
Hold on.

1539
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:08,760
Uh, the game went black again.

1540
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:09,560
This happened before.

1541
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:13,640
Hold on, let me, like, open up a manuscript and see if maybe
that'll get, uh...

1542
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,940
It's true what they say.

1543
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:17,420
Okay, maybe, maybe, maybe now we're good.

1544
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,260
Okay, here we go.

1545
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:19,780
Oh, where are you?

1546
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:20,100
Oh.

1547
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:28,840
Ouch, why me?

1548
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:33,560
Wait,

1549
01:37:40,990 --> 01:37:41,830
wait, where are we going?

1550
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:42,870
This way?

1551
01:37:43,070 --> 01:37:43,170
Oh.

1552
01:37:43,950 --> 01:37:44,390
Ouch.

1553
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,410
Get some!

1554
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:46,850
Here?

1555
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:48,850
What am I supposed to do here?

1556
01:37:50,710 --> 01:37:52,010
What are we supposed to do here?

1557
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,140
Oh, I don't think I'm...

1558
01:37:57,140 --> 01:37:58,880
I think I need them to come closer.

1559
01:38:01,120 --> 01:38:01,860
Follow the kidnapper.

1560
01:38:06,340 --> 01:38:07,140
Is that it?

1561
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:08,220
Ah!

1562
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,310
Oh my gosh, that scared me.

1563
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,750
Yeah!

1564
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,880
What the heck?

1565
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:28,780
How did it...

1566
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:29,560
How is it doing that?

1567
01:38:30,740 --> 01:38:31,160
I don't...

1568
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:33,060
I don't know what we're supposed to do.

1569
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,080
Hello?

1570
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:45,270
I think that was the last one.

1571
01:38:46,130 --> 01:38:46,610
There we go.

1572
01:38:47,350 --> 01:38:50,670
Use the flares from the emergency box to hold them off while
I get these boards off.

1573
01:38:50,810 --> 01:38:52,070
Oh, we're out of flares.

1574

Wait.

1575
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,770
Wait, we're out of flares.

1576
01:38:55,050 --> 01:38:55,590
Are you kidding?

1577
01:38:55,690 --> 01:38:55,950
Wait!

1578
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:56,490
Give me the gun.

1579
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:57,010
Oh, no.

1580
01:38:57,190 --> 01:38:58,310
No time for backtalk.

1581
01:38:58,610 --> 01:38:59,570
Hold them off, damn it.

1582
01:38:59,730 --> 01:39:00,150
Uh-oh.

1583
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,370
Guys, I think we're, uh, screwed.

1584
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:20,690
I can't...

1585
01:39:20,690 --> 01:39:22,670
Yeah, we're so screwed.

1586
01:39:23,350 --> 01:39:23,930
Wait, we're so screwed.

1587
01:39:24,090 --> 01:39:24,350
Oh my god.

1588
01:39:24,830 --> 01:39:25,690
He's right on me.

1589
01:39:25,850 --> 01:39:26,370
Wait, wait.

1590
01:39:27,010 --> 01:39:28,130
Excuse me.

1591
01:39:28,290 --> 01:39:28,770
Hold on.

1592
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:32,830
I don't have a gun!

1593
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:38,410
We're so screwed.

1594
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:39,690
We're so screwed.

1595
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:40,330
We're so screwed.

1596
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:40,910
We're so...

1597
01:39:40,910 --> 01:39:42,090
I'm so screwed.

1598
01:39:44,890 --> 01:39:46,870
Okay, I have three.

1599
01:39:49,030 --> 01:39:49,290
Okay.

1600
01:39:51,070 --> 01:39:51,230
What?

1601
01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:52,190
Ow, John.

1602
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,380
Okay, let's not waste all of our...

1603
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:02,480
Can you actually aim, please?

1604
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:06,520
Yeah.

1605
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:09,280
Can we please aim?

1606
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:14,440
That's right.

1607
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:21,300
Okay, I think that...

1608
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:21,600
Alright.

1609
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:22,720
Okay.

1610
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:27,100
Thank you for the redirect!

1611
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:30,320
I'm in a bit of a panic right now!

1612
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:31,520
Are you kidding?

1613
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:32,380
Give me the gun!

1614
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,200
No time for back talk!

1615
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:35,380
Hold him off, damn it!

1616
01:40:35,440 --> 01:40:35,840
Okay!

1617
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:37,580
I'm gonna do my best!

1618
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,300
Hold down.

1619
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:46,860
Just a little longer.

1620
01:40:47,180 --> 01:40:47,780
Scare them off.

1621
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:49,880
Ha!

1622
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:51,020
Ha!

1623
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,700

1624
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:56,300
Ha!

1625
01:40:57,180 --> 01:40:58,260
That's my last one.

1626
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:00,200
Last one, mister.

1627
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:01,380
Okay.

1628
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,600
Now we're screwed.

1629
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:03,680
Now we're screwed.

1630
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:05,660
Oh, we're screwed.

1631
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:06,260
We're screwed.

1632
01:41:07,820 --> 01:41:08,420
We're screwed.

1633
01:41:08,940 --> 01:41:11,160
Go, go, go, go!

1634
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,260
Go, go, go, please.

1635
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:14,180
Oh my god.

1636
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,500
Oh, I'm gonna die.

1637
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:18,200
I'm gonna die.

1638
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,060
Yeah,

1639
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:28,730
actually.

1640
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:30,290
No, no thanks to you.

1641
01:41:31,650 --> 01:41:33,970
You could have given me like 15 more flares, please.

1642
01:41:34,030 --> 01:41:34,590
Better get ready.

1643
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:35,850
They'll be on us soon.

1644
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:37,190
I have ready how?

1645
01:41:38,210 --> 01:41:41,530
I have nothing with nothing on me.

1646
01:41:44,230 --> 01:41:44,950
Is this it?

1647
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:47,490
Is this our lover's seat?

1648
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:48,230
Oh.

1649
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:49,330
Last stand.

1650
01:41:49,370 --> 01:41:50,050
Last stand.

1651
01:41:51,110 --> 01:41:51,730
Get ready!

1652
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:54,650
We fight them as long as they keep coming.

1653
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:55,230
Oh, okay.

1654
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:56,730
Give me the goddamn gun!

1655
01:41:56,950 --> 01:41:57,330
They're coming!

1656
01:41:57,950 --> 01:41:59,090
That's not how this goes.

1657
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:00,730
Get with a program, wait.

1658
01:42:01,470 --> 01:42:01,870
Oh!

1659
01:42:02,210 --> 01:42:03,590

1661
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:15,970
Stop moving.

1662
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:16,710
Okay, sorry.

1663
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,710
I wish I had a gun.

1664
01:42:29,950 --> 01:42:30,750
It'd be really cool.

1665
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:32,190
Right now.

1666
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:40,460
Why don't you know how to aim, man?

1667
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:45,520
Mr. I need you to learn how to aim.

1668
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:51,320
Okay, while you get this guy, I'm gonna get the thermos.

1669
01:42:53,360 --> 01:42:55,340
I don't think I can get the thermos.

1670
01:42:57,980 --> 01:42:58,940

01:49:18,260 --> 01:49:20,260
And sometimes I can't tell who's him?

1760
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:23,100
And who's like...

1761
01:49:25,060 --> 01:49:27,280
Who's him and who's like one of the zombie guys?

1762
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:28,500
Because they're all dressed the same.

1763
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,540
Okay, alright, alright.

1764
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:34,620
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1765
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,780
Okay, I have one player left.

1766
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:41,960
Ouch!

1767
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:42,500
Ouch!

1768
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:44,640
Use the flare, please!

1769
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,560
Am I... Am I... Do I need to... Why are they not getting
distracted by the light?

1770
01:49:56,740 --> 01:49:57,320
Oh, please!

1771
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,420
I'm trying to dodge!

1772
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:01,320
Oh, it's this guy!

1773
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:02,240
Oh, it's the big guy!

1774
01:50:05,120 --> 01:50:05,860
Holy shit!

1775
01:50:06,020 --> 01:50:06,720
Holy shit!

1776
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:14,880
Oh my god.

1777
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:18,000
Don't come after me, though!

1778
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:28,040
Get him?

1779
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:28,980
Get his ass?

1780
01:50:29,500 --> 01:50:30,260
Get his ass?

1781
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:30,840
Please?

1782
01:50:31,420 --> 01:50:33,340
Oh, my God.

1783
01:50:33,860 --> 01:50:34,520
Oh, my God.

1784
01:50:34,800 --> 01:50:35,700
Oh, we did it.

1785
01:50:35,780 --> 01:50:37,000
Oh, I'm so sweaty.

1786
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:38,560
I'm so sweaty.

1787
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,240
Let's cut the act now.

1788
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:41,260
Oh, my God.

1789
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:42,320
Where's my wife?

1790
01:50:42,380 --> 01:50:43,620
I knew you were going to say that.

1791
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:44,960
I read it all before.

1792
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:46,320
You're out of your life.

1793
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:47,120
Congratulations.

1794
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:54,480
You're going to think about something glorious and terrible
once we get you some proper editorial control.

1795
01:50:54,780 --> 01:50:55,140
Oh.

1796
01:50:56,060 --> 01:50:57,420
What the hell are you talking about?

1797
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:58,660
Where's Alice?

1798
01:50:58,900 --> 01:51:01,060
I want the entire manuscript.

1799
01:51:01,560 --> 01:51:04,040
Well, she's gonna suffer bad.

1800
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:05,280
You touch her mouth.

1801
01:51:05,620 --> 01:51:05,840
Oh, damn.

1802
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:06,760
Oh, wow.

1803
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:07,300
Good job.

1804
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:12,800
Can I have a gun back, please?

1805
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:14,220
Nice.

1806
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:15,520
Oh, my gosh.

1807
01:51:16,420 --> 01:51:17,400
That was suffering.

1808
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:18,740
Oh, the gun!

1809
01:51:20,540 --> 01:51:21,240
Hey, everyone.

1810
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:22,520
Thank you so much for the fire gifted.

1811
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,320
Guys, that was painful.

1812
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:26,000
I can't imagine that on Nightmare.

1813
01:51:26,940 --> 01:51:27,420
mode.

1814
01:51:29,080 --> 01:51:32,240
You're gonna give me the manuscript or you'll be sorry.

1815
01:51:33,100 --> 01:51:33,320
No!

1816
01:51:33,720 --> 01:51:34,380
Come back here!

1817
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:36,640
I swear I'll kill you if you heard Alice!

1818
01:51:37,120 --> 01:51:37,900
Do you hear me?

1819
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:39,260
Come back here!

1820
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:41,480
Me walking at a snail's pace.

1821
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:43,260
He had Alice.

1822
01:51:43,820 --> 01:51:47,120
And he wanted the manuscript because he thought it held some
magical power.

1823
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:49,240
But I had no manuscript to give him.

1824
01:51:49,820 --> 01:51:52,860
I had to get back to Barry and figure out my next move.

1825
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:54,160
Thank you.

1826
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:55,300
Thank you for the five gifted.

1827
01:51:56,360 --> 01:51:57,500
Alice's fear of the dark.

1828
01:51:57,680 --> 01:52:02,260
On more than one occasion, Alice had tried to explain to me
how it felt to be afraid of the dark.

1829
01:52:02,940 --> 01:52:03,880
I need a second to breathe.

1830
01:52:05,660 --> 01:52:08,080
I love rage games, especially when I'm not playing them.

1831
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,920
It was something you could touch and feel.

1832
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,700
Most of that, it was something with a mind of its own.

1833
01:52:12,980 --> 01:52:14,600
Something malicious and malign.

1834
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:17,660
For her, things changed when they were wrapped in darkness.

1835
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,320
They turned into something else.

1836
01:52:19,660 --> 01:52:20,320
Something foreign.

1837
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:22,900
And nothing was safe or innocent anymore.

1838
01:52:23,280 --> 01:52:25,060
Krish, thank you so much for the thank you for that.

1839
01:52:26,580 --> 01:52:33,220
I think it would have been if I had it like I didn't know
how to use the flares before and so I just wasted a ton of

1840
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:38,900
them and so I was left with very few in the end can I just
like go down here?

1841
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:45,560
Oh, maybe I shouldn't where does that go?

1842
01:52:46,620 --> 01:52:56,320
Wait, maybe I have to go that way oh no kidding, I have to
go that way that's so funny I kept trying to tell you you.

1843
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:59,000
I don't know what you guys want from me.

1844
01:52:59,160 --> 01:53:00,940
To play the game or read chat constantly.

1845
01:53:06,700 --> 01:53:08,300
Air out them pits now.

1846
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:10,700
Oh.

1847
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:14,760
Okay, I'm dropping.

1848
01:53:15,500 --> 01:53:16,560
Where are we dropping, boys?

1849
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:18,980
Good job.

1850
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:26,160
Oh.

1851
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:26,780
Oh.

1852
01:53:29,660 --> 01:53:31,380
Am I not supposed to get on top of this thing?

1853
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:33,920
Let's try again.

1854
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:39,120
One second, before I deal with...

1855
01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:39,560
Oh!

1856
01:53:44,600 --> 01:53:46,560
I see what the direction...

1857
01:53:47,100 --> 01:53:49,400
The direction I was supposed to go.

1858
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:54,940
I'm just going this way to make sure I didn't miss any
items.

1859
01:54:04,890 --> 01:54:05,210
Oops.

1860
01:54:05,930 --> 01:54:07,750
It's okay, we made it, whatever.

1861
01:54:09,630 --> 01:54:10,370
We did it!

1862
01:54:11,530 --> 01:54:12,710
Alan's sequence break.

1863
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,810
I promise not...

1864
01:54:19,810 --> 01:54:20,530
Will you marry me?

1865
01:54:20,650 --> 01:54:26,330
I promise not to take you to a creepy town with a creepy
forest and trap you in a creepy nightmare dimension by

1866
01:54:26,330 --> 01:54:27,730
writing a creepy story.

1867
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:30,830
Oh, Bigfoot strikes again.

1868
01:54:34,230 --> 01:54:34,770
What is this?

1869
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:35,790
What is this?

1870
01:54:36,230 --> 01:54:36,550
What is this?

1871
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:36,910
Ah!

1872
01:54:37,550 --> 01:54:38,630
What the hell?

1873
01:54:39,890 --> 01:54:40,170
Oh!

1874
01:54:40,630 --> 01:54:40,910
Oh!

1875
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:41,070
Oh!

1876
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:44,030
Oh my god, please!

1877
01:54:46,350 --> 01:54:48,610
That was cruel.

1878
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:00,680
Ah.

1879
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:04,060
Alan stuck.

1880
01:55:07,300 --> 01:55:10,360
Not- why would you put it in the middle of the hiking path?

1881
01:55:10,480 --> 01:55:11,800
I'm sorry, that's psychotic.

1882
01:55:12,740 --> 01:55:12,860
Ah!

1883
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:13,700
Another one!

1884
01:55:31,320 --> 01:55:32,220
Psycho behavior!

1885
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:35,160
How am I supposed to- okay, eye on the ground?

1886
01:55:35,900 --> 01:55:38,540
This is actually how I usually walk though, just looking
down.

1887
01:55:40,420 --> 01:55:42,500
Oh, look at all of them!

1888
01:55:44,100 --> 01:55:45,760
Oh my gosh, it's a minefield!

1889
01:55:46,660 --> 01:55:48,000
Oh, this is evil!

1890
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:50,460
What the hell is this?

1891
01:55:53,630 --> 01:55:55,190
What is this?

1892
01:55:55,770 --> 01:55:56,930
Wait, can I walk?

1893
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:59,410
I don't want to run into it.

1894
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:01,370
Oh my god!

1895
01:56:07,890 --> 01:56:09,950
I'm going very slowly.

1896
01:56:17,060 --> 01:56:17,580
Okay.

1897
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:19,100
Uh.

1898
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:20,780
Oh my god.

1899
01:56:21,460 --> 01:56:23,520
This is actual psycho behavior.

1900
01:56:24,320 --> 01:56:26,340
If you go prone, you can pick up the mines.

1901
01:56:26,540 --> 01:56:26,820
I know!

1902
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:27,820
I wish!

1903
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:29,520
I wish!

1904
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:31,680
This is insane!

1905
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:36,680
Mindsweeper trained you for this.

1906
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,040
Focus M!

1907
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:39,360
What is that?

1908
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:39,740
Why?

1909
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,580
What is that?

1910
01:56:40,700 --> 01:56:41,440
Focus M.

1911
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:43,180
Wait, what's over here?

1912
01:56:43,540 --> 01:56:44,260
Oh my gosh.

1913
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:44,720
Okay.

1914
01:56:49,970 --> 01:56:52,010
I don't think I've trained for this.

1915
01:56:52,650 --> 01:56:55,030
Double tap for zombies, quadruple tap for bears.

1916
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:02,930
It's a meme from Triple A Mario.

1917
01:57:03,690 --> 01:57:03,690
What?

1918
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:05,470
What's that?

1919
01:57:08,030 --> 01:57:09,530
I see a house.

1920
01:57:09,750 --> 01:57:13,090
Okay, I'm just gonna start walking forward and hope and
pray.

1921
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:19,380
Why would you lead me this direction if there's nothing
here?

1922
01:57:23,230 --> 01:57:23,810
Can I get them birds?

1923
01:57:27,470 --> 01:57:29,150
I don't want to waste my battery.

1924
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:33,070
They're being evil birds again.

1925
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:42,170
I'm trying to make it through the woods, everybody.

1926
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:46,310
Oh!

1927
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,110
Oh my gosh, manuscript!

1928
01:57:50,150 --> 01:57:51,550
And actual item?

1929
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:53,130
Actual items?

1930
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:55,710
Not just traps?

1931
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:58,070
Actual things!

1932
01:57:58,590 --> 01:57:58,590
Yeah!

1933
01:57:59,290 --> 01:58:00,010
Revolver ammo!

1934
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:01,690
Batteries!

1935
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:02,490
What is that?

1936
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:03,510
Oh, Revolver ammo.

1937
01:58:04,210 --> 01:58:05,390
We take, we take.

1938
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:08,110
Um...

1939
01:58:08,110 --> 01:58:09,830
And then... Manuscript.

1940
01:58:10,930 --> 01:58:11,730
Can I grab that?

1941
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:12,590
Oh yeah.

1942
01:58:13,370 --> 01:58:15,030
Oh my god, be careful, please!

1943
01:58:19,330 --> 01:58:19,970
Alan...

1944
01:58:19,970 --> 01:58:20,630
No fear.

1945
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:25,290
Alan Read!

1946
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:27,550
thinks about Wake.

1947
01:58:27,830 --> 01:58:30,630
Sarah didn't care about the legal threats Wake's agent had
made.

1948
01:58:31,230 --> 01:58:33,630
I'm still recovering from that last bit, man.

1949
01:58:33,650 --> 01:58:36,070
Because there was something about him she couldn't quite put
her finger on.

1950
01:58:36,570 --> 01:58:38,150
Something that reminded her of her father.

1951
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:40,490
She didn't think Wake would hurt his wife.

1952
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:43,590
Then she thought about the way he waited into Hartman.

1953
01:58:44,170 --> 01:58:46,710
That hair trigger rage flaring up without warning.

1954
01:58:53,930 --> 01:58:54,450
Hmm.

1955
01:58:55,230 --> 01:58:55,970
Daddy issues?

1956
01:58:58,090 --> 01:59:04,690
the cans can be shot yeah but i don't want to waste ammo i
mean i'm not not that i'll waste it but you know i'll shoot

1957
01:59:04,690 --> 01:59:05,430
it it's fun

1958
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:10,990
we've seen them before i just never shot them before

1959
01:59:15,080 --> 01:59:25,040
i'm searching for traps who set all these up i just i have a
question for you

1960
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:34,730
oh i have to go across you Imagine they put the traps on the
bridge as well.

1961
01:59:35,190 --> 01:59:36,350
Also, this is not a bridge.

1962
01:59:36,910 --> 01:59:38,710
This is not a very good hiking trail.

1963
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:40,250
That's how I think about it.

1964
01:59:40,890 --> 01:59:42,090
This is a hiking trail!

1965
01:59:43,050 --> 01:59:43,310
Hmm.

1966
01:59:48,540 --> 01:59:51,840
Are we still on- this clearly seems like a trail.

1967
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:53,180
I'm scared.

1968
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:54,560
I'm scared of the traps.

1969
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:56,120
Okay.

1970
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:57,620
Oh.

1971
01:59:58,800 --> 01:59:59,840
Wait, where are- Ah!

1972
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:00,400
God!

1973
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:01,780
Oh!

1974
02:00:03,600 --> 02:00:06,060
Uh, uh, clear- Oh my god.

1975
02:00:11,100 --> 02:00:12,040
Where are you?

1976
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,400
Where are you guys?

1977
02:00:14,940 --> 02:00:15,420
Oh,

1978
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:40,020
make it through the woods is such an understatement.

1979
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,920
You know!

1980
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:44,960
What?

1981
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:45,480
What's happening?

1982
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:47,520
What's going on?

1983
02:00:48,340 --> 02:00:49,960
Wait, that doesn't seem good.

1984
02:00:52,620 --> 02:00:53,200
Uh, shoot.

1985
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,760
Oh, what a time to need to reload my weapon!

1986
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:10,160
Does it ever end?

1987
02:01:10,500 --> 02:01:12,060
There's too many campers out here.

1988
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:17,920
And now I also have to look out for bear traps and
everything.

1989
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:19,680
Going the wrong way.

1990
02:01:20,260 --> 02:01:21,820
Can't follow the gamer paint.

1991
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:25,560
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

1992
02:01:30,400 --> 02:01:31,300
Yeah, what the hell?

1993
02:01:32,820 --> 02:01:33,460
Good question.

1994
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:34,960
What the hell?

1995
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:36,140
What the hell?

1996
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,620
What the heck is going on here?

1997
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:45,060
Oh my god.

1998
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:53,380
Where'd you go?

1999
02:01:54,020 --> 02:01:54,620
Oh,

2000
02:01:57,670 --> 02:01:58,270
can I...

2001
02:01:58,270 --> 02:01:58,750
Okay, good.

2002
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:07,410
Oh, we were still in, we were still in, like, the fight
mode, so I was able to, uh, reload.

2003
02:02:08,870 --> 02:02:10,930
Luckily, where, where am I going?

2004
02:02:12,230 --> 02:02:13,010
This way?

2005
02:02:13,530 --> 02:02:15,190
I guess I gotta follow the...

2006
02:02:15,210 --> 02:02:17,710
the yellow dot, right?

2007
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:21,430
Make it through the woods, everybody.

2008
02:02:21,650 --> 02:02:22,210
That's all they say.

2009
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:24,050
Make it through the woods and you'll be okay!

2010
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:24,850
Oh!

2011
02:02:26,290 --> 02:02:26,890
Oh god!

2012
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:27,590
Ouch!

2013
02:02:27,730 --> 02:02:28,510
Oh, I tried to dodge!

2014
02:02:34,580 --> 02:02:36,040
Oh, why are you so strong?

2015
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:47,450
Ah, please!

2016
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:48,910
Why are you so strong?

2017
02:02:51,850 --> 02:02:52,830
Oh my gosh.

2018
02:02:56,170 --> 02:02:58,230
I just wanted to turn on the lights!

2019
02:02:59,770 --> 02:03:00,950
I knew they would come.

2020
02:03:01,150 --> 02:03:02,070
They do this every time.

2021
02:03:02,250 --> 02:03:02,790
Oh, sorry.

2022
02:03:02,990 --> 02:03:03,550
That was me going.

2023
02:03:03,690 --> 02:03:03,970
Yippee!

2024
02:03:07,170 --> 02:03:07,690
Yippee!

2025
02:03:10,250 --> 02:03:12,830
I'm almost out of battery.

2026
02:03:14,290 --> 02:03:14,810
Golly!

2027
02:03:15,330 --> 02:03:16,230
Jump for joy!

2028
02:03:19,150 --> 02:03:19,670
Woo!

2029
02:03:20,270 --> 02:03:20,790
Yippee!

2030
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:21,730
You think Barry's still...

2031
02:03:21,730 --> 02:03:22,770
Okay, that guy?

2032
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:24,830
You think he's still around?

2033
02:03:24,990 --> 02:03:25,650
What's this?

2034
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:26,550
Is that a door?

2035
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:28,490
Oh.

2036
02:03:28,510 --> 02:03:29,190
we get in here.

2037
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:33,930
Why is he jump like that?

2038
02:03:34,350 --> 02:03:35,270
This is a happy guy.

2039
02:03:36,130 --> 02:03:36,690
It's me.

2040
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:38,030
Alan wake!

2041
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:39,590
Alan jump.

2042
02:03:41,810 --> 02:03:42,590
Where have I got more?

2043
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:43,850
Oh, thank goodness.

2044
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:47,750
Are those bear traps on the tree?

2045
02:03:48,090 --> 02:03:48,510
Evil.

2046
02:03:53,370 --> 02:03:53,850
Thermos.

2047
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:54,610
I couldn't...

2048
02:03:54,610 --> 02:03:56,150
I didn't know how to grab the thermos.

2049
02:03:57,770 --> 02:04:00,530
During that one scene where we were getting ambushed.

2050
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:15,890
on at lover's peak if you want to be my lover you gotta get

2057
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:10,020
Zombie ship never ends.

02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:13,180
Oh, oh no.

2059
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:14,720
What happens to my arm?

2060
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:17,180
Oh, geez.

2061
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:19,100
Chainsaw.

Love that for us.

2063
02:05:23,160 --> 02:05:24,720
Big fan, big fan.

2064
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:31,080
Oh, I can reload.

2065
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:31,940
I'm a liar.

2066
02:05:32,360 --> 02:05:33,080
Maybe...

2067
02:05:33,080 --> 02:05:34,540
I don't know what I was thinking.

2068
02:05:39,020 --> 02:05:43,880
oh oops that's not what i meant to do i'm guessing i just
drop here

2069
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:55,190
i don't see it i don't see a path though but

2070
02:05:58,770 --> 02:06:07,770
it has to be right it looks like i need to get over to where
that light is down there where are we dropping boys here

2071
02:06:07,770 --> 02:06:19,950
apparently i guess i wouldn't have this to lead us here if
if it weren't for that you know is that a plane

2072
02:06:24,170 --> 02:06:28,670
I think that's a plane you guys see that

2073
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:49,790
whoa Alan fly I think I have to go this way oh folks What am
I focusing on?

2074
02:06:50,770 --> 02:06:51,500
What am I focusing on?

2075
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:53,810
I had heard the plane fall.

2076
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:55,430
It made no sense.

2077
02:06:55,970 --> 02:06:57,950
It was clear that it had just fallen here.

2078
02:06:58,470 --> 02:07:01,470
But it was very old and obviously hadn't flown with decades.

2079
02:07:02,510 --> 02:07:04,530
Looking at it, sent a shiver down my spine.

2080
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:06,090
That's what we heard!

2081
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:08,690
Interesting.

2082
02:07:13,810 --> 02:07:14,810
Rock ASMR?

2083
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:18,310
Okay.

2084
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:19,650
Checkpoint.

2085
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:21,210
We love those.

2086
02:07:23,870 --> 02:07:25,810
I look like I'm in the jungles.

2087
02:07:28,850 --> 02:07:30,410
I'm looking for any secrets.

2088
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:32,070
Any, like, whispers?

2089
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:35,770
I don't hear any.

2090
02:07:41,460 --> 02:07:43,420
Oh, I went out of here.

2091
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:46,740
Oh, I went out of here.

2092
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:47,860
For realsies!

2093
02:07:48,300 --> 02:07:48,640
Ouch!

2094
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:49,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2095
02:07:49,340 --> 02:07:49,680
Fire.

2096
02:07:50,460 --> 02:07:50,840
Yeah.

2097
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:53,940
Wait, where is he?

2098
02:07:54,560 --> 02:07:54,940
Oh, jeez.

2099
02:08:00,950 --> 02:08:01,430
Ouch!

2100
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:02,670
Ouch, I tried to dodge!

2101
02:08:03,670 --> 02:08:04,830
Don't you dare.

2102
02:08:08,210 --> 02:08:08,570
Yeah!

2103
02:08:09,230 --> 02:08:09,710
Jeez.

2104
02:08:12,890 --> 02:08:13,270
Holy!

2105
02:08:15,850 --> 02:08:17,330
Make it out of the woods.

2106
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:20,250
So much easier said than done, huh?

2107
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:21,250
More!

2108
02:08:21,970 --> 02:08:24,210
Oh my gosh, I saw him appear literally in front of me.

2109
02:08:25,390 --> 02:08:25,650
Wee!

2110
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:30,410
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

2111
02:08:36,120 --> 02:08:38,620
We switch the spawn in.

2112
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:48,190
Give me a moment's respite.

2113
02:08:50,610 --> 02:08:51,270
Oh, Lee.

2114
02:08:52,030 --> 02:08:57,050
I thought the game, the first time it was very generous
with, like, everything.

2115
02:08:57,850 --> 02:08:58,870
Now it's a little tricky.

2116
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:00,190
It's actually quite tricky.

2117
02:09:01,890 --> 02:09:10,690
don't have much battery left and it's not giving me any more
that's scary first chapter did not have this much combat

2118
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:20,710
there I'm getting ambushed by like four guys every time it's
crazy and people said that this game is not the type where

2119
02:09:20,710 --> 02:09:34,530
you avoid combat that they're that they're quite generous
with like giving you stuff but I'm getting like I'm getting

2120
02:09:34,530 --> 02:09:45,390
I'm getting I'm getting winded here and there's obviously a
guy around still I can't believe they made the whole level

2121
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:52,970
out of the expression we're not out of the woods yet and I
need to go that way okay oh I see a house I'm

2122
02:09:56,070 --> 02:09:56,970

2123
02:10:03,560 --> 02:10:10,320
thermos where are you I hear you guys Maybe I don't.

2124
02:10:10,540 --> 02:10:11,480
Maybe it's the spooky wind.

2125
02:10:13,320 --> 02:10:14,480
Maybe it's spooky wind.

2126
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,020
Oh.

2127
02:10:16,980 --> 02:10:17,980
Alan run.

2128
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:26,980
Oh my god.

2129
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:27,520
Wait.

2130
02:10:28,460 --> 02:10:29,080
Oh please.

2131
02:10:29,700 --> 02:10:30,340
My battery.

2132
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:34,260
Ouch.

2133
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:34,520
Ouch.

2134
02:10:36,460 --> 02:10:37,180
What do I...

2135
02:10:37,180 --> 02:10:38,900
What do they do when I'm out of batteries?

2136
02:10:40,380 --> 02:10:41,420
What am I supposed to do?

2137
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:45,500
Oh my god.

2138
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:48,520
How am I supposed to get rid of their...

2139
02:10:55,250 --> 02:10:55,990
Oh, okay.

2140
02:10:56,310 --> 02:10:57,370
That's the recharge.

2141
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:01,490
It still slowly recharges.

2142
02:11:01,890 --> 02:11:02,570
Oh, jeez.

2143
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:02,970
Okay.

2144
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:03,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2145
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:04,770
Okay, I see it.

2146
02:11:04,830 --> 02:11:05,670
I see it.

2147
02:11:05,970 --> 02:11:06,810
I see it.

2148
02:11:07,130 --> 02:11:07,650
Golly.

2149
02:11:09,090 --> 02:11:10,110
It's tough.

2150
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:13,130
No battery here?

2151
02:11:14,010 --> 02:11:14,290
Nothing?

2152
02:11:14,550 --> 02:11:15,390
Just a free...

2153
02:11:15,390 --> 02:11:17,150
Was I just walking off the trail?

2154
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:26,100
Oh, checkpoints.

2155
02:11:28,340 --> 02:11:29,000
Oh, oops.

2156
02:11:32,220 --> 02:11:34,400
Did I just explode in the water?

2157
02:11:44,560 --> 02:11:46,620
What are you thinking about the game so far?

2158
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:48,360
Are you enjoying it?

2159
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:49,200
Yeah, I am.

2160
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:49,780
I am.

2161
02:11:51,200 --> 02:11:52,800
Oh, it is tough, though.

2162
02:11:52,840 --> 02:11:53,740
I'm not gonna lie.

2163
02:11:54,020 --> 02:11:54,420
Oh my gosh.

2164
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:54,880
Oh my gosh.

2165
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:55,400
Oh my gosh.

2166
02:11:55,580 --> 02:11:56,700
It's pretty tricky.

2167
02:11:58,560 --> 02:11:59,120
Ow!

2168
02:12:01,160 --> 02:12:01,960
Now I miss.

2169
02:12:03,340 --> 02:12:04,940
Now I'm in a spooky house.

2170
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,580
Is this anything?

2171
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:08,040
No.

2172
02:12:10,240 --> 02:12:12,500
Yeah, it does have rough sections.

2173
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:14,280
It's...

2174
02:12:14,280 --> 02:12:15,020
It's tough.

2175
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:16,900
Oh.

2176
02:12:17,260 --> 02:12:18,640
Oh, some more of this stuff.

2177
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:24,040
Reach the top of the mill.

2178
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,440
Keep running up that road.

2179
02:12:26,980 --> 02:12:28,460
Keep running up that mill.

2180
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:32,100
Is this an elevator?

2181
02:12:32,360 --> 02:12:32,820
It is.

2182
02:12:34,540 --> 02:12:34,940
Wee!

2183
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:46,120
Ouch!

2184
02:12:46,520 --> 02:12:47,220
Oh my gosh.

2185
02:12:48,640 --> 02:12:50,080
Oh, you can't step on it.

2186
02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:55,420
It's evil goop.

2187
02:12:56,460 --> 02:12:57,500
The goop is evil.

2188
02:12:58,580 --> 02:12:59,020
Understood.

2189
02:13:00,580 --> 02:13:01,680
I've learned my lesson.

2190
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:05,720
Okay.

2191
02:13:05,880 --> 02:13:07,480
Evil oil.

2192
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:13,440
Um...

2193
02:13:13,440 --> 02:13:14,040
Oh, more?

2194
02:13:19,670 --> 02:13:20,110
Yes.

2195
02:13:20,930 --> 02:13:23,810
Let's see, let's go up this staircase first real quick.

2196
02:13:26,890 --> 02:13:27,330
Alan.

2197
02:13:28,530 --> 02:13:28,910
Oh, okay.

2198
02:13:29,450 --> 02:13:30,750
That's what I thought it would be.

2199
02:13:30,890 --> 02:13:32,310
Oh, oh, I could kick this.

2200
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:35,710
And then it- oh, it will- oh, okay.

2201
02:13:35,870 --> 02:13:38,150
Wait, before we do that, let's explore over here.

2202
02:13:41,590 --> 02:13:50,270
what's that uh bendy and the ink machines is alan and the
foot goop oh okay i thought there i knew there would be

2203
02:13:50,270 --> 02:13:57,830
something manuscript page but not a lot of you know what
maybe it's not so bad that there's not a lot of supplies

2204
02:13:57,830 --> 02:14:07,710
because that means um hopefully hopefully that means that
we're not about to fight a big baddie the foot goop deputies

2205
02:14:07,710 --> 02:14:11,090
at the logging site The logging site was a mess.

2206
02:14:11,590 --> 02:14:13,930
The modular office had been pushed off the cliff.

2207
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:18,610
Deputy Thornton climbed up from the wreckage excited,
breathing hard from the exertion.

2208
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:19,830
Nobody there.

2209
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:20,710
It's weird.

2210
02:14:21,610 --> 02:14:22,390
Don't you think that's weird?

2211
02:14:23,170 --> 02:14:24,930
Bored, Mulligan let out a mighty snort.

2212
02:14:25,730 --> 02:14:27,050
Hell, it's always weird, Thornton.

2213
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:30,530
Just a question of sorting out what kind of weird it is this
time around.

2214
02:14:31,050 --> 02:14:32,690
Why are you guys frowning?

2215
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,300
Why are we frowning?

2216
02:14:40,340 --> 02:14:45,320
I would really appreciate like a battery at the very least.

2217
02:14:49,300 --> 02:14:49,820
Kick.

2218
02:14:50,840 --> 02:14:52,140
Oh, there we go.

2219
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:59,680
Been playing this on and off for years.

2220
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,380
For about 15 years.

2221
02:15:01,980 --> 02:15:02,960
Did you beat it?

2222
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:04,460
Wait, can I jump this?

2223
02:15:05,040 --> 02:15:05,660
Alan jump.

2224
02:15:06,720 --> 02:15:07,040
Nice.

2225
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,220
Oh, Alan jump again.

2226
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:11,660
All right, we got another manuscript to read.

2227
02:15:14,840 --> 02:15:15,960
Oh, Barry.

2228
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:20,020
When Barry saw the darkness attack the visitor center, it
made him a believer.

2229
02:15:20,780 --> 02:15:21,960
The men all said he'd shot.

2230
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:24,120
They hadn't been just locals on Crank.

2231
02:15:24,820 --> 02:15:26,260
Somehow the world had changed.

2232
02:15:26,800 --> 02:15:28,700
Like the channel had been switched without warning.

2233
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:32,420
You think you're watching a sitcom and you're really
watching a horror show.

2234
02:15:32,520 --> 02:15:33,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2235
02:15:33,200 --> 02:15:36,260
When the birds started attacking the cabin, Barry wasn't
surprised.

2236
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:37,700
Just terrified.

2237
02:15:37,860 --> 02:15:39,460
I think I would still be surprised.

2238
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:43,580
Why are the birds attacking the cab?

2239
02:15:43,720 --> 02:15:44,880
Like, even the birds!

2240
02:15:45,160 --> 02:15:46,020
That's what I'd be thinking.

2241
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:51,740
Even the birds are in on this?

2242
02:15:52,120 --> 02:15:54,180
That's what I'd be, I'd be like, no way!

2243
02:15:54,480 --> 02:15:55,660
Oh, we got some flares, though.

2244
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:58,440
I'll take those, for sure.

2245
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:01,280
No ammo.

2246
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:02,160
How much?

2247
02:16:02,440 --> 02:16:02,680
Okay.

2248
02:16:05,680 --> 02:16:06,720
Uh, thermos?

2249
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:08,140
What?

2250
02:16:08,580 --> 02:16:09,100
Why?

2251
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:10,720
What spooky music?

2252
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:11,500
What?

2253
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:12,140
What?

2254
02:16:12,140 --> 02:16:12,340
What?

2255
02:16:17,540 --> 02:16:19,360
Where do I go?

2256
02:16:21,080 --> 02:16:23,020
Oh, there's a stair- or ladder.

2257
02:16:26,660 --> 02:16:27,640
Even the birds!

2258
02:16:31,440 --> 02:16:33,500
Alright, more goop.

2259
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:38,420
Take care of that, take care of that.

2260
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:44,540
The birds are the evil- are the boss this time.

2261
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:51,000
Maybe I wasn't so off on that.

2262
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:55,060
Maybe the birds are the boss this time.

2263
02:16:56,440 --> 02:16:57,540
Is that a hole?

2264
02:16:57,660 --> 02:16:58,400
Does that go down?

2265
02:16:59,500 --> 02:17:00,080
Whoa.

2266
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:05,580
Not the chunky bird.

2267
02:17:07,040 --> 02:17:08,860
Thank you for the super challenge.

2268
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:10,040
Thank you.

2269
02:17:12,540 --> 02:17:13,300
Oh, oh.

2270
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:19,730
Almost there, I think.

2271
02:17:23,260 --> 02:17:37,160
look at all that poo the birds really hate this place
checkpoint okay thank goodness the darkness wears her face

2272
02:17:37,160 --> 02:17:52,720
what's that mean so the lady that lady that we've seen in
the dark in the be aware of wheelbapers oh gosh this is a

2273
02:17:52,720 --> 02:17:53,260
big guy.

2274
02:17:56,800 --> 02:17:57,060
Oh, shoot.

2275
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,720
I meant to hold it.

2276
02:17:58,820 --> 02:17:59,060
Oh, no.

2277
02:17:59,140 --> 02:18:00,360
I just wasted both of them.

2278
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:03,460
I just wasted both of them.

2279
02:18:04,060 --> 02:18:05,180
That's so funny, isn't it?

2280
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:09,040
Isn't that, like, hilarious?

2281
02:18:10,880 --> 02:18:13,280
It's fine if I have to redo this part.

2282
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:15,860
Alan waste.

2283
02:18:15,980 --> 02:18:17,460
I'm still getting used to the flares.

2284
02:18:21,500 --> 02:18:23,060
I can't believe I wasted both of them.

2285
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:24,060
I like panic.

2286
02:18:24,780 --> 02:18:26,380
Panic used them.

2287
02:18:28,380 --> 02:18:28,500
Oops.

2288
02:18:30,060 --> 02:18:31,640
I can only blame myself there.

2289
02:18:33,580 --> 02:18:34,340
Hunting rifle.

2290
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:35,700
Thank you.

2291
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:38,540
Alan panic.

2292
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:39,420
Alan jump.

2293
02:18:39,740 --> 02:18:40,460
Alan jump.

2294
02:18:40,840 --> 02:18:41,860
Alan jump.

2295
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:43,840
Aha!

2296
02:18:46,600 --> 02:18:48,040
Pick it up.

2297
02:18:50,320 --> 02:18:52,200
Oh, another manuscript.

2298
02:18:52,500 --> 02:18:59,160
Gosh, this guy is just yapping and riot in wake feels the
dark presence shadow stirred and the wind picked up as i ran

2299
02:18:59,160 --> 02:19:06,040
through the forest i felt the dark presence turning its gaze
toward me then the moonlight was blotted out by dark shadows

2300
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:13,080
that raised violently across the ground moving too swiftly
to be natural darkness gathered between the trees and melt

2301
02:19:13,080 --> 02:19:27,640
again to reveal the taken no no i don't like these i don't i
don't like this Um, did you guys, what was that movie?

2302
02:19:27,940 --> 02:19:29,960
A Darkness Falls, I think it was called.

2303
02:19:30,560 --> 02:19:31,920
It was about, like, the Tooth Fairy.

2304
02:19:32,700 --> 02:19:37,420
But she only would come out in the darkness.

2305
02:19:40,760 --> 02:19:43,040
That's what this reminds me of a little bit.

2306
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:45,840
It's a pretty old horror movie.

2307
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:54,380
But I remember it very vividly because, like, it scared my
friend.

2308
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,420
so much.

2309
02:19:58,920 --> 02:20:04,460
And so I always thought of it as a very scary movie because
my friend was so scared of it.

2310
02:20:05,980 --> 02:20:07,040
It terrified me as a kid.

2311
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:07,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2312
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:10,660
Wait, how do I...

2313
02:20:13,060 --> 02:20:14,100
Oh, here we go.

2314
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:16,580
Hey!

2315
02:20:23,580 --> 02:20:26,200
Those sound like bats.

2316
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,420
Those Those don't sound like bones.

2317
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:32,000
Oh, thank goodness.

2318
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:35,640
Oh, we have a battery again.

2319
02:20:36,120 --> 02:20:37,500
We have two batteries.

2320
02:20:38,700 --> 02:20:39,980
Oh, thank goodness.

2321
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,440
Um, I guess I'm...

2322
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:48,740
The yellow points in this...

2323
02:20:48,740 --> 02:20:49,520
Oh, I see.

2324
02:20:50,820 --> 02:20:52,280
But what's this way?

2325
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:58,250
Anything?

2326
02:20:59,510 --> 02:20:59,910
A cave?

2327
02:21:03,790 --> 02:21:04,270
Nope.

2328
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:07,130
Just a red herring.

2329
02:21:11,390 --> 02:21:13,110
Make it through the woods.

2330
02:21:13,250 --> 02:21:15,150
I would like a different objective, please.

2331
02:21:16,170 --> 02:21:17,290
I'm done with the woods.

2332
02:21:18,090 --> 02:21:19,230
I don't like the woods anymore.

2333
02:21:19,510 --> 02:21:19,750
Ah!

2334
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:23,110
Oh, come on.

2335
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:24,710
Ouch!

2336
02:21:29,610 --> 02:21:31,130
Oh, you're too far, huh?

2337
02:21:31,230 --> 02:21:31,970
Is that what it is?

2338
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:40,040
Oh shoot.

2339
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:45,540
Oh my god, no.

2340
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:03,450
Switch weapon.

2341
02:22:04,550 --> 02:22:04,770
Oh my god.

2342
02:22:05,730 --> 02:22:06,710
He's a big boy.

2343
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:08,730
I didn't even notice that he was a big boy.

2344
02:22:13,290 --> 02:22:14,890
Man, our batteries.

2345
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:17,290
Those guys could like eat up batteries.

2346
02:22:17,490 --> 02:22:17,930
They're crazy.

2347
02:22:19,930 --> 02:22:24,130
I don't know how I survived that at all.

2348
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:29,030
Honestly, how did we make it?

2349
02:22:29,110 --> 02:22:29,530
I don't know.

2350
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:32,770
They were just like...

2351
02:22:32,770 --> 02:22:35,010
I don't know how we made that.

2352
02:22:35,950 --> 02:22:36,730
I don't know.

2353
02:22:37,670 --> 02:22:38,730
But we did.

2354
02:22:39,330 --> 02:22:39,570
Weeer.

2355
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:41,950
Oh, come on.

2356
02:22:42,010 --> 02:22:43,330
You won't let me climb the logs.

2357
02:22:48,520 --> 02:22:49,440
I hear more.

2358
02:22:50,420 --> 02:22:51,300
Rocks shifting.

2359
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:57,380
We're almost back to camp, maybe?

2360
02:23:01,690 --> 02:23:02,150
Oh, four.

2361
02:23:02,170 --> 02:23:03,330
Bore batteries!

2362
02:23:04,510 --> 02:23:04,770
Please.

2363
02:23:04,970 --> 02:23:05,550
Oh, okay.

2364
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:06,750
We have too much.

2365
02:23:07,550 --> 02:23:07,890
Revolver.

2366
02:23:07,990 --> 02:23:08,390
Oh, flare.

2367
02:23:10,430 --> 02:23:11,310
We're getting there.

2368
02:23:11,410 --> 02:23:12,490
Yeah, the campgrounds.

2369
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:13,290
We're almost back.

2370
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:16,150
This is a really nice...

2371
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:18,170
This is, like, an extremely nice...

2372
02:23:20,190 --> 02:23:20,670
Uh...

2373
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:21,330
What's the word?

2374
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:24,630
Uh...

2375
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:25,670
National Park?

2376
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:27,970
Oh.

2377
02:23:28,870 --> 02:23:31,930
Well, it would be so nice if someone wasn't chopping down
all the trees.

2378
02:23:38,500 --> 02:23:47,160
awesome this looks like a this looks like a paintball arena

god there's a couple of them

2381
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:17,030
He's too far, I guess.

2382
02:24:19,370 --> 02:24:20,090
And flare!

2383
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:40,220
Wait, can you like...

2384
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:48,260
Yeah, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2385
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:50,220
Oh my god, oh my god!

2386
02:24:50,320 --> 02:24:50,520
Run!

2387
02:24:51,580 --> 02:24:51,920
Run!

2388
02:24:52,580 --> 02:24:55,040
Oh my

2389
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:04,890
god, I'm stuck on something!

2390
02:25:15,950 --> 02:25:16,310
Scary.

2391
02:25:16,670 --> 02:25:21,230
There's gotta be a dumpster full of ammo around here, right?

2392
02:25:23,650 --> 02:25:24,290
Right.

2393
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:26,590
He was a biggin.

2394
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:27,510
Yeah, he was.

2395
02:25:28,670 --> 02:25:29,590
No dumpsters?

2396
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:33,310
Like a little mini boss.

2397
02:25:34,590 --> 02:25:36,890
And we still have one battery somehow.

2398
02:25:37,930 --> 02:25:38,570
Amazing!

2399
02:25:40,470 --> 02:25:41,550
How do we do it?

2400
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:45,770
The world feels so open.

2401
02:25:46,670 --> 02:25:46,950
intimidating.

2402
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:49,250
Like, I want to just go into the wilderness.

2403
02:25:50,110 --> 02:25:51,790
But I know I shan't.

2404
02:25:52,850 --> 02:25:56,750
Like, probably not wise.

2405
02:26:03,980 --> 02:26:04,540
Light.

2406
02:26:07,020 --> 02:26:08,600
Oh, he's calling me.

2407
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:09,000
Hello?

2408
02:26:09,400 --> 02:26:09,740
Barry?

2409
02:26:10,020 --> 02:26:10,400
Barry?

2410
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:16,500
Stay out of sight.

2411
02:26:16,820 --> 02:26:17,600
I'm on my way.

2412
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:19,000
Don't open the door.

2413
02:26:19,560 --> 02:26:20,360
What is it, crazy?

2414
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:21,820
Stay hidden.

2415
02:26:22,160 --> 02:26:33,220
I'll be there soon, make sure you keep the lights on yeah
keep the lights on oh what's going on what was that they've

2416
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:34,690
gone hitchcock on them

2417
02:26:39,020 --> 02:26:48,460
where i'm okay so we're at the camping ground oh hello yes

2418
02:26:55,130 --> 02:27:01,650
whoa oh there must i still had to reach barry at the cabin
but at least I was out of the woods.

2419
02:27:02,130 --> 02:27:02,350
Are we?

2420
02:27:02,390 --> 02:27:03,990
Oh, I guess technically we are.

2421
02:27:05,530 --> 02:27:07,170
Oh, we're out of the woods.

2422
02:27:10,250 --> 02:27:12,030
Oh, we're out of the woods.

2423
02:27:12,730 --> 02:27:13,790
We did it, everybody.

2424
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:17,490
We did it.

2425
02:27:19,550 --> 02:27:21,030
A lot of birds.

2426
02:27:24,940 --> 02:27:25,620
What's this?

2427
02:27:26,060 --> 02:27:26,780
Is this a car?

2428
02:27:27,660 --> 02:27:29,840
I'd have to get the car from the locked garage.

2429
02:27:30,360 --> 02:27:32,140
It would get me back to bury faster.

2430
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:32,640
Yeah.

2431
02:27:32,640 --> 02:27:34,440
And the headlights were a welcome bonus.

2432
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:37,580
Okay, find the garage keys.

2433
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:42,840
Great, collision.

2434
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:45,000
Good.

2435
02:27:47,180 --> 02:27:50,960
Pretty sure this was supposed to be an open world game at
some point, so that makes sense.

2436
02:27:51,080 --> 02:27:51,780
Oh, really?

2437
02:27:53,560 --> 02:27:59,920
Yeah, like it just feels like, you know, it's pretty linear
in where it tells you to go and everything too, but there's

2438
02:27:59,920 --> 02:28:09,420
also, so much that I feel like I I feel like I can explore
but I don't think there's anything back there so that's why

2439
02:28:09,420 --> 02:28:17,780
I don't go to explore it Allen out of the woods Nightingale
fires at wake uh oh wait that doesn't sound so good FBI

2440
02:28:17,780 --> 02:28:25,840
agents command FBI I considered surrender it was all falling
apart anyway wait I could give in let someone else deal with

2441
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:33,020
it but it felt all wrong cold instinct his posture the way
he held the gun he was no friend Whoa.

2442
02:28:33,420 --> 02:28:34,380
Shots ringing in my ears.

2443
02:28:34,660 --> 02:28:38,260
I leap for the hole in the fence and stumbled into the
darkness beyond.

2444
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:47,060
Yeah, we've had several things about this guy and we haven't
even met him yet.

2445
02:28:47,940 --> 02:28:49,480
Mr. Nightingale.

2446
02:28:50,260 --> 02:28:51,800
I'm already suspicious of you.

2447
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:54,260
I had to find the key to the garage.

2448
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:55,880
I'm working on it.

2449
02:28:56,760 --> 02:28:57,800
I wonder...

2450
02:28:57,800 --> 02:29:00,540
I hope I don't have to drive the car myself.

2451
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:05,880
Because that won't go so well, I think.

2452
02:29:08,520 --> 02:29:11,700
Like, I think it will be very good.

2453
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:14,160
I needed the garage key to get to the car.

2454
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:16,840
Okay, but like, where is it that I'm searching?

2455
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:22,320
Maybe, oh, you know what?

2456
02:29:22,380 --> 02:29:23,680
Let me go search the bathrooms.

2457
02:29:25,340 --> 02:29:29,000
I was thinking it might be inside one of these, but...

2458
02:29:29,760 --> 02:29:31,120
He thinks I'm leaving.

2459
02:29:31,300 --> 02:29:32,540
No, I'm just exploring.

2460
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:36,300
I'm working on it.

2461
02:29:40,450 --> 02:29:41,110
What's that sound?

2462
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:44,430
Let's go in this one first.

2463
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:49,850
Oh, oh, this one's spookier.

2464
02:29:50,210 --> 02:29:52,650
Even though the lights are on, it's like a creepy...

2465
02:30:02,620 --> 02:30:03,300
What was that?

2466
02:30:03,440 --> 02:30:04,540
Is there a bird in here?

2467
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:09,520
Yeah, horror always happens in the bathrooms.

2468
02:30:09,700 --> 02:30:10,400
You're so right.

2469
02:30:12,180 --> 02:30:14,040
No, I'm scared.

2470
02:30:25,380 --> 02:30:26,560
I gotta be brave.

2471
02:30:26,960 --> 02:30:30,990
Oh, I've gotta be...

2472
02:30:30,990 --> 02:30:31,880
Okay, here I go.

2473
02:30:36,370 --> 02:30:38,030
What do you mean checkpoint reached?

2474
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:38,870
In the bathroom?

2475
02:30:40,330 --> 02:30:42,210
What do you mean by that?

2476
02:30:42,670 --> 02:30:44,570
Why is there a checkpoint in the bathroom, please?

2477
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:48,950
Oh.

2478
02:30:50,130 --> 02:30:50,670
TV.

2479
02:30:54,030 --> 02:30:54,390
What?

2480
02:30:54,790 --> 02:30:55,190
This...

2481
02:30:55,190 --> 02:30:55,430
What?

2482
02:30:56,050 --> 02:30:57,290
Is this a shower room?

2483
02:30:58,350 --> 02:30:59,070
Garage keys!

2484
02:30:59,350 --> 02:30:59,630
Okay, wait.

2485
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:01,770
Before I get these, though, I want to go into the other
side.

2486
02:31:03,170 --> 02:31:04,770
How to make the bathroom not scary.

2487
02:31:04,970 --> 02:31:05,670
Peep, peep, peep, peep.

2488
02:31:06,930 --> 02:31:11,750
If this is a shower room, why is there a TV in here?

2489
02:31:11,830 --> 02:31:14,290
Wouldn't it get wet and stop working?

2490
02:31:14,610 --> 02:31:18,770
All right, let's go to the other side first before I grab
those keys and trigger whatever's going to happen.

2491
02:31:19,290 --> 02:31:19,470
You know?

2492
02:31:19,930 --> 02:31:20,610
Oh, my God.

2493
02:31:26,270 --> 02:31:27,990
Wait, there's no toilet seats in this one.

2494
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:30,330
Why?

2495
02:31:31,950 --> 02:31:33,530
Why are there no toilet seats in here?

2496
02:31:36,190 --> 02:31:38,150
You just go in a hole in the ground, maybe.

2497
02:31:42,440 --> 02:31:43,160
There's also...

2498
02:31:43,160 --> 02:31:43,820
No TV.

2499
02:31:43,960 --> 02:31:46,380
I guess it did say that it was under construction, didn't
it?

2500
02:31:46,500 --> 02:31:47,960
So I guess that makes sense.

2501
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:51,700
Alright, so we got the hunting ammo.

2502
02:31:52,480 --> 02:31:53,400
We love to see it.

2503
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:54,300
Alright, let's go.

2504
02:31:55,320 --> 02:31:58,940
Let's go trigger whatever is going to trigger from me
picking this up.

2505
02:31:59,080 --> 02:31:59,420
Yeah.

2506
02:32:03,260 --> 02:32:10,640
a story is not a machine that does what you tell it a story
is a beast with a life of its own you can create it shape it

2507
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:16,840
but as the story grows it starts wanting things of its own
change one thing and you set off a chain reaction of events

2508
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:22,580
that spreads through the whole thing the characters have to
be true to themselves the events need to follow a logic that

2509
02:32:22,580 --> 02:32:32,180
fits the story a single flaw and the magic is gone the story
dies Alice dies Have you guys like...

2510
02:32:32,180 --> 02:32:33,900
Oh my god, the TV has exploded.

2511
02:32:34,740 --> 02:32:35,560
It doesn't work.

2512
02:32:35,780 --> 02:32:36,960
It's just...

2513
02:32:36,960 --> 02:32:37,360
Uh-oh.

2514
02:32:37,900 --> 02:32:44,900
Have you guys seen all the like drama with the ending of
Stranger Things?

2515
02:32:45,380 --> 02:32:52,140
And like this thing called Conformity Theory?

2516
02:32:55,260 --> 02:32:56,600
Oh my goodness.

2517
02:32:57,420 --> 02:32:58,120
I...

2518
02:32:58,220 --> 02:33:05,160
i only watched like maybe the first two seasons of stranger
things so i wasn't i liked it when i watched it but i wasn't

2519
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:18,320
so into the show or anything so basically i haven't heard
the theory so basically the ending of the show was so bad to

2520
02:33:18,320 --> 02:33:26,840
people they thought it was so bad there were so many plot
holes that were like left unanswered so many things um that

2521
02:33:26,840 --> 02:33:35,860
like the fandom essentially kind of uh so so one thing about
stranger things from the beginning they were like question

2522
02:33:35,860 --> 02:33:41,880
everything nothing is a coincidence there's always a reason
if something is there and it's not it doesn't seem right

2523
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:48,140
there's always a reason for it questioned everything and so
they came up with this thing called conform the conformity

2524
02:33:48,140 --> 02:34:00,420
theory that like um because they feel they thought that
there would be one final episode that was actually the real

2525
02:34:00,420 --> 02:34:08,840
finale to the show and that the the current finale of the
show is like one of the characters is actually being mind

2526
02:34:08,840 --> 02:34:20,960
controlled and or something I don't know and like the the
writers they did like they did like post series interviews

2527
02:34:20,960 --> 02:34:27,920
and they were like what and people would ask questions like
what was up with this and they'd be like oh we don't know

2528
02:34:28,220 --> 02:34:30,220
But people are like, you wrote the show.

2529
02:34:30,400 --> 02:34:31,520
Why don't you know?

2530
02:34:31,860 --> 02:34:43,840
And so it's kind of insane how like it became such a big
thing that people were like pointing out little tiny

2531
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:44,380
details.

2532
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:46,600
And I mean really tiny details.

2533
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:48,180
So like so tiny.

2534
02:34:48,480 --> 02:34:52,860
Like in season one, the door handle was on this side of the
door.

2535
02:34:52,980 --> 02:35:01,140
But in season five, the door handle was on the other side of
the door, are in an alternate universe and it's not real

2536
02:35:01,140 --> 02:35:09,600
things like like that tiny of details that they were like
this is this is not real this is not the real ending and

2537
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:20,960
then netflix hinted at like something coming out on the on
january 7th and and so everyone was like the real final

2538
02:35:20,960 --> 02:35:36,680
episode is to come january 7th and uh it's the 10th as of as
of this moment it's kind of insane how like how how they had

2539
02:35:36,680 --> 02:35:40,520
to cope so bad zadornov yeah

2540
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:49,980
uh i watched the final episode it was fine it wasn't
fantastic but it ended pretty much as i expected i don't

2541
02:35:49,980 --> 02:36:00,320
know anything like people were of course for most things or
for a lot of things i won't say most but um it can be pretty

2542
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:05,880
difficult people will always have different kinds of
expectations for what they expect for an ending of a show so

2543
02:36:05,880 --> 02:36:11,980
obviously you're not gonna be able to please everybody i
don't even know understand what everybody's so upset about

2544
02:36:11,980 --> 02:36:23,700
stranger things post credit scene yes mr president How is it
that Breaking Bad is the only show not to mess up their

2545
02:36:23,700 --> 02:36:24,120
ending?

2546
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:25,180
Oh my gosh!

2547
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:27,640
New silk sanity just dropped.

2548
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:30,520
It's kind of really fascinating to just see like all this.

2549
02:36:30,620 --> 02:36:36,240
And I feel bad for Stranger Things fans that like didn't
like the ending and are, you know.

2550
02:36:36,460 --> 02:36:39,720
You know, I feel bad for them because they really like the
show.

2551
02:36:39,920 --> 02:36:44,300
And if you don't like the ending, like that's always a
little, that's always a little icky, right?

2552
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:46,340
But it's kind of so.

2553
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:59,460
had a good ending but what about our six seasons and a movie
Sherlock oh yeah Sherlock also Mass Effect Game of Thrones

2554
02:36:59,460 --> 02:37:09,120
fans first time oh wait is that I've never heard that the
Mass Effect ending is bad uh-oh very MGS 5 coded yeah yeah

2555
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:19,380
yeah yeah I watched I'm on episode or rather I watched
episode 13 of Breaking Bad yesterday and I said that I would

2556
02:37:19,380 --> 02:37:23,620
watch 14, 15, 16 on stream.

2557
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:24,780
I would do a watch along.

2558
02:37:24,940 --> 02:37:29,340
But that means I need to set aside three hours to do that.

2559
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:34,620
To also, and then maybe also to have a stream.

2560
02:37:34,880 --> 02:37:36,960
So I've been trying, I was like, maybe I do it today.

2561
02:37:37,060 --> 02:37:38,620
But I was like, I can't do it before stream.

2562
02:37:38,760 --> 02:37:39,600
I don't have time.

2563
02:37:39,760 --> 02:37:41,460
So I'm like, dang it.

2564
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,380
Scrubs had a beautiful ending after eight seasons.

2565
02:37:44,540 --> 02:37:48,960
And that's a good ending for like a beloved TV show.

2566
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:58,640
is like the best thing you could ever ask for or a good or a
beloved video game so

2567
02:38:03,240 --> 02:38:12,600
so I might I don't have time tomorrow either so maybe Monday
I wasn't going to stream on Monday but if it's just a watch

2568
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:18,780
along you know promised Neverland anime had a good ending
shame they never did a second season wait I thought people

2569
02:38:18,780 --> 02:38:20,860
didn't I like the Promise Neverland anime.

2570
02:38:21,960 --> 02:38:22,860
Or was it the manga?

2571
02:38:23,180 --> 02:38:23,780
I don't remember.

2572
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:30,580
Mass Effect 3 ending was legendarily bad and had a lot of
controversies like this.

2573
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:33,860
But I guess it happened before your gaming time.

2574
02:38:35,360 --> 02:38:36,360
Maybe, uh.

2575
02:38:37,880 --> 02:38:38,300
But.

2576
02:38:39,660 --> 02:38:40,040
Oh.

2577
02:38:41,780 --> 02:38:42,420
Woo!

2578
02:38:48,330 --> 02:38:49,470
What did he say?

2579
02:38:53,940 --> 02:38:55,040
What'd that guy say?

2580
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:57,780
You can learn something about myself?

2581
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:06,520
People were but hurt about Mass Effect 3.

2582
02:39:06,820 --> 02:39:07,420
It's crazy.

2583
02:39:12,220 --> 02:39:15,040
Promise Neverland's manga developed in a way I wasn't
expecting.

2584
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,460
I heard, like, controversy about that, too.

2585
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:18,280
Enter!

2586
02:39:18,600 --> 02:39:19,240
Uh-oh, wait.

2587
02:39:20,020 --> 02:39:21,240
I have to drive?

2588
02:39:21,660 --> 02:39:21,920
Uh-oh.

2589
02:39:22,040 --> 02:39:23,260
Wait, do I have to drive?

2590
02:39:23,440 --> 02:39:23,900
Uh-oh, wait.

2591
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:25,020
This looks like I have to drive.

2592
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:26,640
Oh, no, I have to drive!

2593
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:37,980
What do you mean breaks?

2594
02:39:38,900 --> 02:39:39,660
What are breaks?

2595
02:39:42,820 --> 02:39:43,960
Oh, wait.

2596
02:39:44,520 --> 02:39:45,880
Hold down A to boost.

2597
02:39:47,220 --> 02:39:48,020
Oh, cool!

2598
02:39:53,140 --> 02:39:53,620
Wow!

2599
02:39:54,160 --> 02:39:54,880
Oh, whoa.

2600
02:39:59,310 --> 02:39:59,810
Oh, shoot.

2601
02:40:01,090 --> 02:40:02,470
Uh, I need to go this way, I think.

2602
02:40:04,510 --> 02:40:04,910
Oh.

2603
02:40:05,570 --> 02:40:06,410
Wait, hold on.

2604
02:40:06,670 --> 02:40:07,550
Uh, hold on.

2605
02:40:07,610 --> 02:40:07,930
One second.

2606
02:40:15,860 --> 02:40:16,340
Oh.

2607
02:40:16,360 --> 02:40:17,300
What the hell?

2608
02:40:17,560 --> 02:40:18,800
Why is there so much stuff in the road?

2609
02:40:24,370 --> 02:40:25,630
Uh, this way?

2610
02:40:30,150 --> 02:40:31,430
Am I doing this right?

2611
02:40:37,560 --> 02:40:38,440
Oh, shoot.

2612
02:40:44,180 --> 02:40:45,240
This is definitely tough.

2613
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:49,640
This is tricky.

2614
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:52,880
Oh, we're here!

2615
02:40:54,340 --> 02:40:55,460
Uh, where?

2616
02:40:57,960 --> 02:40:59,220
Where was Barry?

2617
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:00,480
Uh...

2618
02:41:00,500 --> 02:41:02,140
Uh, oh, I think I just...

2619
02:41:02,140 --> 02:41:02,840
Oh, okay, here it is.

2620
02:41:02,940 --> 02:41:03,660
Okay, just kidding.

2621
02:41:10,280 --> 02:41:11,340
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2622
02:41:11,780 --> 02:41:12,300
Oh, my God.

2623
02:41:14,380 --> 02:41:14,540
Oh.

2624
02:41:16,700 --> 02:41:17,100
Uh.

2625
02:41:18,040 --> 02:41:19,420
How do I get around that?

2626
02:41:22,100 --> 02:41:23,500
The music stopped.

2627
02:41:25,600 --> 02:41:27,660
Uh, do I push it?

2628
02:41:35,380 --> 02:41:36,180
Uh-huh.

2629
02:41:37,740 --> 02:41:39,180
Now it's just a comedy.

2630
02:41:44,020 --> 02:41:44,820
Uh...

2631
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:46,720
Walk, how do I get out?

2632
02:42:04,130 --> 02:42:04,930
Wait...

2633
02:42:04,930 --> 02:42:06,250
Oh, okay.

2634
02:42:16,070 --> 02:42:17,230
What's that?

2635
02:42:18,030 --> 02:42:18,430
Where?

2636
02:42:19,830 --> 02:42:21,710
No, please let me drive through!

2637
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:26,900
Uh...

2638
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:27,240
Oh.

2639
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:28,820
Okay, we're fine.

2640
02:42:29,040 --> 02:42:29,260
Never mind.

2641
02:42:33,100 --> 02:42:34,920
I think I might have missed a bunch of stuff.

2642
02:42:36,120 --> 02:42:37,080
Because I...

2643
02:42:38,320 --> 02:42:43,420
The flare gun was probably the best weapon I could imagine
against the dark things I was facing.

2644
02:42:43,720 --> 02:42:44,680
Yeah, that's so true.

2645
02:42:48,180 --> 02:42:48,660
Um...

2646
02:42:49,180 --> 02:42:49,660
Anyway.

2647
02:42:50,780 --> 02:42:51,400
What were they saying?

2648
02:42:51,820 --> 02:42:52,440
I don't remember.

2649
02:42:53,360 --> 02:42:53,700
Ah!

2650
02:43:05,080 --> 02:43:06,280
Wait, what happened to...

2651
02:43:14,990 --> 02:43:15,590
Ouch!

2652
02:43:15,810 --> 02:43:15,810
Ouch!

2653
02:43:16,090 --> 02:43:16,090
Ouch!

2654
02:43:16,630 --> 02:43:16,950
Ouch!

2655
02:43:16,950 --> 02:43:17,130
Ouch!

2656
02:43:18,190 --> 02:43:18,490
Ouch!

2657
02:43:18,490 --> 02:43:19,110
My flare gun!

2658
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:25,410
Ouch!

2659
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:30,150
Hey!

2660
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:31,510
I'm missed with the flare.

2661
02:43:31,770 --> 02:43:32,590
Wait, that's embarrassing.

2662
02:43:34,210 --> 02:43:35,050
Oh my gosh.

2663
02:43:35,910 --> 02:43:36,250
Ah!

2664
02:43:38,770 --> 02:43:40,650
Oh my god, wait, you're right there.

2665
02:43:43,950 --> 02:43:44,550
Ah!

2666
02:43:45,050 --> 02:43:45,550
Okay.

2667
02:43:52,970 --> 02:43:54,830
Oh, okay, okay.

2668
02:43:55,530 --> 02:43:57,950
I couldn't remember how the flare gun worked again.

2669
02:44:00,370 --> 02:44:02,610
Alright, um, any more of those?

2670
02:44:06,890 --> 02:44:09,090
Is this gonna go out again?

2671
02:44:09,990 --> 02:44:11,210
My safety light?

2672
02:44:18,330 --> 02:44:19,290
Uh, where?

2673
02:44:19,470 --> 02:44:20,650
Okay, we just...

2674
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:21,490

02:44:57,270 --> 02:44:58,850
Yes, yes, I get you.

2683
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:00,190
Uh-oh.

2684
02:45:01,430 --> 02:45:03,090
All these demon birds.

2685
02:45:04,210 --> 02:45:05,590
Why is it every time I go home?

2686
02:45:05,970 --> 02:45:07,530
There's demon birds waiting for me.

2687
02:45:08,990 --> 02:45:10,310
Can I kill these guys?

2688
02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:13,390
From here?

2689
02:45:16,980 --> 02:45:17,640
Excuse me.

2690
02:45:18,080 --> 02:45:19,040
You're not demon, are you?

2691
02:45:20,140 --> 02:45:21,020
Demonic birds?

2692
02:45:24,820 --> 02:45:27,180
You're gonna attack me or...

2693
02:45:27,180 --> 02:45:27,980
What are we doing here?

2694
02:45:28,980 --> 02:45:30,380
They're like sky ants.

2695
02:45:30,440 --> 02:45:32,320
Barry had talked about birds over the phone.

2696
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:32,960
Yeah, yeah.

2697
02:45:33,560 --> 02:45:34,740
I'm working on it.

2698
02:45:36,520 --> 02:45:37,060
The lights!

2699
02:45:37,400 --> 02:45:37,760
Barry!

2700
02:45:38,700 --> 02:45:40,060
Why did the lights go out?

2701
02:45:42,700 --> 02:45:43,260
Uh...

2702
02:45:43,260 --> 02:45:44,020
Are they gone?

2703
02:45:44,260 --> 02:45:44,980
They seem gone.

2704
02:45:45,920 --> 02:45:46,420
Uh...

2705
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:48,820
The darkness controls the taken.

2706
02:45:50,140 --> 02:45:50,700
Yes.

2707
02:45:54,200 --> 02:45:55,080
Thank you.

2708
02:45:55,960 --> 02:45:56,780
Thank you.

2709
02:45:57,600 --> 02:45:58,480
Wait, why is it?

2710
02:45:58,580 --> 02:45:59,080
Wait, what is that?

2711
02:45:59,280 --> 02:45:59,340
Oh.

2712
02:46:00,620 --> 02:46:01,600
Yes, thank you.

2713
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:07,040
Is there anything else in here?

2714
02:46:07,760 --> 02:46:09,960
I think I got everything from before, but...

2715
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:14,280
The door?

2716
02:46:15,880 --> 02:46:16,600
Controls him.

2717
02:46:18,240 --> 02:46:19,800
Okay, in there, babe.

2718
02:46:21,290 --> 02:46:21,510
Where?

2719
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:22,930
Why did the lights go out?

2720
02:46:28,960 --> 02:46:29,400
Oh.

2721
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:29,780
Oh boy.

2722
02:46:30,660 --> 02:46:31,000
Oh boy.

2723
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:32,220
What's happening?

2724
02:46:35,200 --> 02:46:35,380
Oh!

2725
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:36,680
Oh boy.

2726
02:46:37,400 --> 02:46:37,940
What's happening?

2727
02:46:39,780 --> 02:46:43,580
Oh boy Wow!

2728
02:46:45,160 --> 02:46:45,580
Ammo!

2729
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:46,740
Batters.

2730
02:46:47,520 --> 02:46:49,540
Yeah, yeah.

2731
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:52,660
Oh my god.

2732
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:57,060
Yeah, a little bit.

2733
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:58,400
Can I get in?

2734
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,220
Will you let me in?

2735
02:47:00,900 --> 02:47:01,460
Wait, what's this?

2736
02:47:01,760 --> 02:47:02,720
More flares!

2737
02:47:04,940 --> 02:47:05,460
Oh, shoot.

2738
02:47:06,200 --> 02:47:08,580
Oh, my God!

2739
02:47:09,220 --> 02:47:09,640
Crazy!

2740
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:10,860
Can I commit?

2741
02:47:11,820 --> 02:47:12,420
Can you let me in?

2742
02:47:12,580 --> 02:47:12,720
No?

2743
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:17,140
Oh.

2744
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:19,240
What's going on here?

2745
02:47:19,960 --> 02:47:20,260
Oh!

2746
02:47:24,480 --> 02:47:25,820
Defeat the birds!

2747
02:47:26,120 --> 02:47:27,040
Oh, fun!

2748
02:47:29,940 --> 02:47:30,540
Oh.

2749
02:47:31,200 --> 02:47:31,600
Okay.

2750
02:47:31,920 --> 02:47:32,620
Good thing I didn't show you.

2751
02:47:32,640 --> 02:47:33,020
shoot that.

2752
02:47:35,500 --> 02:47:36,160
We're getting there.

2753
02:47:40,640 --> 02:47:40,960
Oh no.

2754
02:47:41,180 --> 02:47:41,640
Ah, shoot.

2755
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:44,920
We're killing them.

2756
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:45,660
A little by little.

2757
02:47:47,020 --> 02:47:47,760
This is so funny.

2758
02:47:49,700 --> 02:47:50,420
Am I getting them?

2759
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:50,840
Yeah.

2760
02:47:51,460 --> 02:47:52,100
One by one.

2761
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:55,700
How many do I need to take out?

2762
02:47:59,440 --> 02:48:00,920
I'm working on it.

2763
02:48:01,420 --> 02:48:02,400
I'm working on it.

2764
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:03,520
Where are they?

2765
02:48:06,240 --> 02:48:06,960
Are they on the other side?

2766
02:48:07,260 --> 02:48:08,240
Oh no, here they are.

2767
02:48:10,460 --> 02:48:12,320
Yeah, you stupid birds.

2768
02:48:19,020 --> 02:48:19,780
Where are they?

2769
02:48:19,920 --> 02:48:20,020
Oh.

2770
02:48:25,350 --> 02:48:25,730
Yeah.

2771
02:48:26,610 --> 02:48:28,490
I got them that good a good amount, I think.

2772
02:48:29,370 --> 02:48:29,470
Oh.

2773
02:48:31,050 --> 02:48:33,250
They're a little more aggressive now.

2774
02:48:35,470 --> 02:48:37,250
How many birds do I need to take out?

2775
02:48:43,190 --> 02:48:43,970
Pick that up.

2776
02:48:51,750 --> 02:48:52,270
Yes.

2777
02:48:58,750 --> 02:48:59,830
Oh, that was a good amount.

2778
02:49:00,270 --> 02:49:01,230
Oh my god, my eyes.

2779
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:02,530
So bright.

2780
02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:23,830
Oh, they really are gone.

2781
02:49:26,570 --> 02:49:27,470
Hey, Al.

2782
02:49:27,970 --> 02:49:31,110
I'm sorry for thinking you were having a second.

2783
02:49:31,730 --> 02:49:33,130
Yeah, you should be.

2784
02:49:35,610 --> 02:49:39,810
I sent Barry to the town to ask around about a man fitting
the kidnapper's description.

2785
02:49:40,590 --> 02:49:42,170
He'd go through the archives of local paper.

2786
02:49:43,090 --> 02:49:43,990
Perhaps he could learn something.

2787
02:49:44,690 --> 02:49:47,310
Anything about the island and the cabin that had
disappeared.

2788
02:49:50,270 --> 02:49:51,590
The man wanted a manuscript.

2789
02:49:53,070 --> 02:49:55,450
I had to try to write him one to get Alice back.

2790
02:49:58,630 --> 02:50:00,270
This one was a long episode.

2791
02:50:01,130 --> 02:50:02,490
It wasn't so long, I feel.

2792
02:50:04,510 --> 02:50:07,950
For me, the supernatural had always been nothing but a
metaphor for the human psyche.

2793
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:09,050
I'm assuming I'm at the end of the episode.

2794
02:50:09,090 --> 02:50:10,470
A tool to use in writing fiction.

2795
02:50:11,110 --> 02:50:12,910
Now, it was happening for real.

2796
02:50:13,310 --> 02:50:15,530
And I couldn't put a single word on paper.

2797
02:50:15,830 --> 02:50:16,170
No.

2798
02:50:17,250 --> 02:50:17,690
No.

2799
02:50:18,190 --> 02:50:19,690
Not the writer's block.

2800
02:50:23,380 --> 02:50:24,600
Barry Wheeler speaking.

2801
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:26,200
Yeah, Barry was being reasonable.

2802
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:28,200
I found Mr. Wake's pages.

2803
02:50:28,420 --> 02:50:31,140
Oh, you sweet, brilliant girl.

2804
02:50:31,140 --> 02:50:32,760
Could you and Mr. Wake come back?

2805
02:50:32,780 --> 02:50:36,860
She sounds drunk or something.

2806
02:50:36,880 --> 02:50:38,020
We'll be there in less than an hour.

2807
02:50:38,700 --> 02:50:39,220
See you soon.

2808
02:50:39,620 --> 02:50:40,580
Bye now.

2809
02:50:41,240 --> 02:50:42,260
Have a great day.

2810
02:50:43,560 --> 02:50:44,900
Hope you come back soon.

2811
02:50:45,860 --> 02:50:48,260
Welcome to the oh dear diner.

2812
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:49,780
Good girl.

2813
02:50:52,740 --> 02:50:53,620
Ooh, creepy.

2814
02:50:54,940 --> 02:51:01,750
Ba-da-ba-ba.

2815
02:51:02,790 --> 02:51:04,330
Ba-da-ba-ba.

2816
02:51:12,550 --> 02:51:17,210
This is, this is very like, this feels, this song feels very
Silent Hill.

2817
02:51:22,010 --> 02:51:22,290
Woo!

2818
02:51:25,010 --> 02:51:27,410
Is this gonna get me DMCA though?

2819
02:51:31,570 --> 02:51:38,400
End of- Holy cow!

2820
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:43,600
It's okay, the last episode got, uh, what's the word?

2821
02:51:44,440 --> 02:51:45,640
Oh, the song is so good, though.

2822
02:51:45,700 --> 02:51:46,840
I'll just turn it down a little bit.

2823
02:51:47,300 --> 02:51:52,020
The last episode got, or the last stream got, uh, got,
what's it called?

2824
02:51:52,840 --> 02:51:53,560
Gotcha, too.

2825
02:51:55,500 --> 02:51:56,220
So, yay!

2826
02:51:56,980 --> 02:51:57,100
Oh.

2827
02:51:57,260 --> 02:51:59,900
On Alan Wake, Alice has been kidnapped.

2828
02:52:00,020 --> 02:52:01,400
Alan, please help me.

2829
02:52:01,820 --> 02:52:04,020
You'll do exactly what I say if you ever want to hear your
wife again.

2830
02:52:04,040 --> 02:52:06,140
I can't tell anyone except my agent Barry.

2831
02:52:06,240 --> 02:52:07,500
Damn it, Barry, the killer.

2832
02:52:07,660 --> 02:52:09,780
You're my best friend, and I'm worried that you're not right
in the head.

2833
02:52:09,780 --> 02:52:10,740
Wait, what about the dog?

2834
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:14,080
The ranch was a manuscript I supposedly wrote that's coming
true before my eyes.

2835
02:52:14,380 --> 02:52:20,780
happened just the way it was on that page they got rusty
what about the dog only a few scattered pages i want the

2838
02:52:35,940 --> 02:52:42,420

2839
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:46,560
was digging around yeah Mr. Wake, it's Sheriff Breaker.

2840
02:52:46,880 --> 02:52:47,200
Oh, no.

2841
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:48,600
We have an FBI agent here.

2842
02:52:49,060 --> 02:52:49,640
Agent Nightgown.

2843
02:52:49,760 --> 02:52:50,340
Oh, no!

2844
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:51,340
FBI.

2845
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:53,420
He is anxious to see you.

2846
02:52:53,620 --> 02:52:54,860
You'd better come to the station.

2847
02:52:55,300 --> 02:52:56,760
Okay, I'll be right over, Sheriff.

2848
02:52:56,840 --> 02:52:57,460
I think I'm in trouble.

2849
02:52:58,100 --> 02:52:59,560
Let's make this quick, huh?

2850
02:53:00,080 --> 02:53:02,360
The dog corpse was right outside the hole in the wall.

2851
02:53:02,460 --> 02:53:03,480
No, it wasn't.

2852
02:53:03,600 --> 02:53:04,220
I didn't see it.

2853
02:53:04,340 --> 02:53:04,680
Oh.

2854
02:53:04,860 --> 02:53:05,720

I came from underneath the table.

2879
02:55:50,280 --> 02:55:54,980
Alan Wake is one of my favorite franchises, which makes it
even better that you're playing it on my birthday!

2880
02:55:55,180 --> 02:55:55,620
Vampire!

2881
02:55:55,780 --> 02:55:56,660
Happy birthday!

2882
02:55:57,560 --> 02:55:59,520
Let me quit the game.

2883
02:56:00,420 --> 02:56:01,160
Quit the menu.

2884
02:56:02,560 --> 02:56:02,920
Okay.

2885
02:56:04,540 --> 02:56:08,960
Oh, one thing that I like about the game that's fun is each
episode here.

2886
02:56:09,020 --> 02:56:09,420
Hold on.

2887
02:56:10,760 --> 02:56:22,320

2890
02:56:43,800 --> 02:56:48,560

watching you play it is a real treat oh my god death pigeon

2891
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:59,740
it is spooky but it's actually not so bad i feel let me put
on some music i was very excited to see you'd be joining

2892
02:56:59,740 --> 02:57:11,340
doki again of course of course nexi any other friends you'll
do an mgs backseat for a roach in the whole series back on

2893
02:57:11,340 --> 02:57:17,700
metal gear i think she i think matara khan needs to get back
on metal gear let's see

2894
02:57:24,390 --> 02:57:25,510
hold on

2895
02:57:28,990 --> 02:57:39,650
that was my controller that roach will she remember anything
correctly probably i think she'll have to replay what did

2896
02:57:39,650 --> 02:57:47,090
she she played one and two she didn't play three solid chaos
for welcome back thank you thank you thank you

2897
02:57:52,050 --> 02:57:53,930
Nimmy, Nimmy too.

2898
02:57:56,710 --> 02:57:57,610
Hi, Ghost Rider.

2899
02:58:01,110 --> 02:58:03,930
She did try an MGS week before.

2900
02:58:04,510 --> 02:58:04,770
Did she?

2901
02:58:04,990 --> 02:58:06,230
Wait, she starred in three.

2902
02:58:06,830 --> 02:58:07,710
But didn't finish.

2903
02:58:08,050 --> 02:58:10,650
How far did she get in three?

2904
02:58:12,190 --> 02:58:12,830
Oh, mama.

2905
02:58:13,790 --> 02:58:17,310
I wonder if Nimmy would like Metal Gear.

2906
02:58:21,640 --> 02:58:26,420
But now that Delta's out, I feel like that's a good way to
play three, honestly.

2907
02:58:26,560 --> 02:58:33,320
I mean, you could do either, but if you're wanting like a,
you know, a newer experience.

2908
02:58:34,680 --> 02:58:40,760
Though, I mean, like the original holds up so well, so it's
fine to play either, honestly.

2909
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:46,780
Nimmy would try to play three as a vegan.

2910
02:58:47,140 --> 02:58:48,400
Oh, you're right!

2911
02:58:49,500 --> 02:58:50,340
You're right!

2912
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:52,520
Oh no!

2913
02:58:54,880 --> 02:58:56,780
I guess you could, right?

2914
02:59:00,430 --> 02:59:00,950
Probably.

2915
02:59:01,250 --> 02:59:03,870
Oh my gosh, you guys know I just noticed.

2916
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:07,790
My Opie mouse pad has a stain on it.

2917
02:59:08,850 --> 02:59:10,230
I don't know if this is a stain.

2918
02:59:12,010 --> 02:59:13,850
Oh no, I'm gonna have to wash it.

2919
02:59:20,820 --> 02:59:22,260
Nimmy is pretty good at Hitman.

2920
02:59:22,720 --> 02:59:23,240
Hitman.

2921
02:59:23,660 --> 02:59:25,020
It's like a Pikmin, but a Hitman.

2922
02:59:25,880 --> 02:59:27,720
You think she'd take to it?

2923
02:59:28,500 --> 02:59:31,720
I think really, I mean, obviously I love...

2924
02:59:31,720 --> 02:59:35,060
Well, you know, I'm not so good at the gameplay, but I still
have fun with it.

2925
02:59:35,460 --> 02:59:37,240
But the story is really...

2926
02:59:38,160 --> 02:59:40,760
What gets me so much about the game, so...

2927
02:59:41,840 --> 02:59:43,060
It's not just playing it.

2928
02:59:43,160 --> 02:59:43,540
Hitman.

2929
02:59:44,900 --> 02:59:45,700
Pikmin-Hipman.

2930
02:59:47,180 --> 02:59:48,600
I want to play Pikmin.

2931
02:59:49,720 --> 02:59:52,140
I want to play Pikmin, but I hear it's hard.

2932
02:59:52,900 --> 02:59:55,180
I hear it's, like, actually, like, a tricky...

2933
02:59:55,180 --> 02:59:57,880
the tough game, at least the earlier ones.

2934
03:00:00,940 --> 03:00:02,240
It is, it can be.

2935
03:00:03,620 --> 03:00:04,040
Yeah.

2936
03:00:05,040 --> 03:00:07,640
I'm an MGS story enjoyer, not a stealth gamer.

2937
03:00:07,860 --> 03:00:09,500
Yeah, exactly, exactly.

2938
03:00:11,820 --> 03:00:13,980
Pickerman, it can be tricky.

2939
03:00:14,880 --> 03:00:15,680
It's stressful.

2940
03:00:16,540 --> 03:00:19,280
All my little guys are gonna, I grow attached to my guys.

2941
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:20,440
I don't want them to die.

2942
03:00:20,620 --> 03:00:21,560
I think I'll cry.

2943
03:00:23,140 --> 03:00:24,020
That rhymes.

2944
03:00:25,380 --> 03:00:26,240
My guys!

2945
03:00:26,940 --> 03:00:27,980
I don't want them to...

2946
03:00:27,980 --> 03:00:28,880
I love my guy.

2947
03:00:29,040 --> 03:00:29,840
I don't want him to die.

2948
03:00:30,100 --> 03:00:31,040
I will cry.

2949
03:00:31,240 --> 03:00:31,800
All right.

2950
03:00:34,020 --> 03:00:35,560
Reese, what are you trying to do there?

2951
03:00:37,120 --> 03:00:38,400
What are you trying to do?

2952
03:00:40,340 --> 03:00:43,120
You'll experience mass extinction events.

2953
03:00:43,680 --> 03:00:46,220
That might make me so sad.

2954
03:00:48,660 --> 03:00:50,720
Active time management game.

2955
03:00:51,420 --> 03:00:51,760
Ha.

2956
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:55,160
I don't know if I would be good at it.

2957
03:00:55,180 --> 03:00:55,500
it.

2958
03:01:03,140 --> 03:01:05,740
I'll try it one day maybe.

2959
03:01:05,940 --> 03:01:06,940
See if I like it.

2960
03:01:07,400 --> 03:01:09,960
I couldn't handle the Pikmin crying as their soul slips.

2961
03:01:09,980 --> 03:01:12,400
So I spent the whole month or the whole time.

2962
03:01:13,040 --> 03:01:21,300
Wait, I spent the whole time boxing monsters Mano Mano in
Pikmin too.

2963
03:01:26,960 --> 03:01:28,520
They're cute but expendable.

2964
03:01:29,540 --> 03:01:32,740
There's like a that Pokemon Go, but it's Pikmin, right?

2965
03:01:33,100 --> 03:01:34,560
They don't die in that, right?

2966
03:01:35,800 --> 03:01:38,960
Do they at least live a happy life then?

2967
03:01:39,580 --> 03:01:41,080
Do they grow old together?

2968
03:01:42,640 --> 03:01:44,560
Do they have a family?

2969
03:01:51,110 --> 03:01:51,910
Surely they do.

2970
03:01:52,090 --> 03:01:52,530
Surely.

2971
03:01:53,830 --> 03:01:56,030
They all go to the farm upstate.

2972
03:01:57,090 --> 03:01:58,430
It's more of a walking game.

2973
03:01:58,770 --> 03:02:00,970
Wasn't that Pokemon Go also?

2974
03:02:01,250 --> 03:02:02,470
I never played Pokemon Go.

2975
03:02:04,670 --> 03:02:15,970
because when I finally so I was in Japan when Pokemon go
came out and and it was not available I guess it wasn't

2976
03:02:15,970 --> 03:02:25,730
available in Japan it was available in overseas first and so
all my friends were doing it all my friends were playing

2977
03:02:25,730 --> 03:02:32,810
Pokemon Go and I was like oh man that looks so fun all my
friends are going out and and everything and then i came

2978
03:02:32,810 --> 03:02:44,770
back home and and the craze was over nobody was playing
pokemon go anymore and so i never got to do it let me see it

2979
03:02:44,770 --> 03:03:02,230
let me see it when did okay let's see it pokemon go pokemon
go release in the u.s australia july 6 2016 Japan was July

2980
03:03:02,230 --> 03:03:04,670
22nd, 2016.

2981
03:03:05,790 --> 03:03:07,150
But I came back later.

2982
03:03:08,270 --> 03:03:09,770
Actually, I didn't know that about Japan.

2983
03:03:09,990 --> 03:03:12,250
That it was released July 22nd.

2984
03:03:13,410 --> 03:03:15,250
It was within the same month.

2985
03:03:16,230 --> 03:03:17,510
But I came back later.

2986
03:03:18,190 --> 03:03:21,870
So, wow, it's been a whole decade since Pokemon Go.

2987
03:03:26,050 --> 03:03:26,650
Wow.

2988
03:03:29,770 --> 03:03:31,430
Actually, maybe I downloaded it.

2989
03:03:31,450 --> 03:03:40,350
it but there was nothing in japan yet i don't remember i
don't remember i'm glad you're enjoying this game speaking

2990
03:03:40,350 --> 03:03:47,550
of old nintendo games i bet you'd have fun with the
warioware games oh yes wait there was that one warriorware

2991
03:03:47,550 --> 03:03:58,810
game i think it came out for uh the switch i wanted to do it
in 3d oh warriorware oh what was it it was like the one move

2992
03:03:58,810 --> 03:04:03,270
it I wanted to do in 3D.

2993
03:04:04,410 --> 03:04:06,710
Wait, maybe we could do that sometime soon.

2994
03:04:08,410 --> 03:04:09,170
That'd be so fun.

2995
03:04:10,510 --> 03:04:12,270
My 3D is still pretty scuffed though.

2996
03:04:13,130 --> 03:04:14,450
My home setup at least.

2997
03:04:19,030 --> 03:04:20,270
Is it fine?

2998
03:04:20,370 --> 03:04:21,230
Did anyone play it?

2999
03:04:21,590 --> 03:04:22,410
Move It is so good.

3000
03:04:23,530 --> 03:04:25,190
You're actually moving it, right?

3001
03:04:26,110 --> 03:04:27,670
I like to move it, move it.

3002
03:04:27,990 --> 03:04:29,130
Wait, what is get it together?

3003
03:04:32,450 --> 03:04:34,270
Oh, there's a new one!

3004
03:04:34,630 --> 03:04:35,090
Wait, it says...

3005
03:04:35,090 --> 03:04:35,430
Wait, no.

3006
03:04:35,630 --> 03:04:35,770
Sorry.

3007
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:36,710
Demo available.

3008
03:04:38,230 --> 03:04:38,650
Which one?

3009
03:04:44,970 --> 03:04:46,290
Is this one newer?

3010
03:04:50,230 --> 03:04:52,870
I have played WarioWare games before, though.

3011
03:04:56,310 --> 03:04:57,330
Get it together as older.

3012
03:04:57,450 --> 03:04:58,150
Oh, okay, okay, okay.

3013
03:05:03,350 --> 03:05:04,430
WarioWare, move it.

3014
03:05:08,600 --> 03:05:10,240
Oh, I'm looking at it now.

3015
03:05:13,160 --> 03:05:15,640
Let me put it down on my calendar so I remember.

3016
03:05:17,060 --> 03:05:18,380
That would be so fun.

3017
03:05:18,980 --> 03:05:19,520
Let's see.

3018
03:05:20,460 --> 03:05:23,480
Maybe not next week, but I could do the week after.

3019
03:05:23,780 --> 03:05:24,600
I'll put it on.

3020
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:25,720
Warrior wear.

3021
03:05:30,860 --> 03:05:32,880
Warrior wear move.

3022
03:05:35,580 --> 03:05:35,960
Nice.

3023
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,440
Next week, I think I'm already off.

3024
03:05:38,460 --> 03:05:46,560
all busy i mean i'm already i'm doing like two games you
know like i'm working on working through alan wake and then

3025
03:05:46,560 --> 03:05:53,440
i have dispatch so that kind of already takes up a little
bit of time thank you for being so cute

3026
03:05:57,980 --> 03:06:14,680
no warrior where warrior doko still waiting on deadly
premonition maybe after well i feel like deadly premonition

3027
03:06:14,680 --> 03:06:19,520
is I don't want to say similar to Alan Wake, but you know
what I mean?

3028
03:06:21,180 --> 03:06:22,160
Maybe after Alan Wake.

3029
03:06:22,340 --> 03:06:25,900
There's a game in between Alan Wake and Alan Wake 2 I have
to play, isn't there?

3030
03:06:28,760 --> 03:06:33,720
Uh, what was it?

3031
03:06:34,880 --> 03:06:35,340
Control.

3032
03:06:37,800 --> 03:06:38,200
Control.

3033
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:41,980
It's actually pretty similar.

3034
03:06:42,120 --> 03:06:43,420
Okay, that's what I thought, right?

3035
03:06:45,000 --> 03:06:47,160
They're both love letters to Twin Peaks.

3036
03:06:48,460 --> 03:06:51,960
We're in our funky Twilight Zone Twin Peak.

3037
03:06:53,500 --> 03:06:54,520
Silly era.

3038
03:06:55,920 --> 03:06:58,180
Not plot length, just the same universe.

3039
03:06:59,720 --> 03:07:01,620
Do I have to play it in between then?

3040
03:07:01,720 --> 03:07:03,260
A lot of people were saying I should.

3041
03:07:06,260 --> 03:07:10,620
Maybe in release, control came out before Alan Wake 2, I'm
guessing.

3042
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:13,760
There is some connection.

3043
03:07:16,400 --> 03:07:23,280
high i think it's good progression for the references very
much recommended but not necessary is what it seems okay

3044
03:07:23,280 --> 03:07:35,140
okay i think wait let me see how long to beat long to beat
control oh okay it's just a couple like maybe two three

3045
03:07:35,140 --> 03:07:42,840
streams that's not so bad i saw the clip about that chat's
child support can you send it to me soon mint junior needs a

3046
03:07:42,840 --> 03:07:48,460
new maid outfit Oh no, look at the time!

3047
03:07:54,140 --> 03:07:56,400
You could cut it if you want to rush Alan Wake.

3048
03:07:56,680 --> 03:07:58,580
I'm not necessarily trying to rush it.

3049
03:07:59,160 --> 03:08:00,740
It's just also...

3050
03:08:00,740 --> 03:08:06,100
I need to play through more Ace Combat before Ace Combat 8
comes out.

3051
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:07,340
Too many games!

3052
03:08:07,560 --> 03:08:08,680
Too many games!

3053
03:08:10,940 --> 03:08:11,840
It's too...

3054
03:08:11,840 --> 03:08:12,400
It's too...

3055
03:08:12,400 --> 03:08:13,700
Like, I want to do that.

3056
03:08:14,140 --> 03:08:14,820
I still have...

3057
03:08:14,820 --> 03:08:16,720
I have like a list of games.

3058
03:08:17,440 --> 03:08:18,340
Like I have on here.

3059
03:08:18,800 --> 03:08:22,920
I had even mass effect on here, but it's so long.

3060
03:08:23,040 --> 03:08:24,240
I don't know if I'll do it.

3061
03:08:25,220 --> 03:08:25,780
I have near.

3062
03:08:26,580 --> 03:08:27,600
I have uncharted.

3063
03:08:29,160 --> 03:08:30,040
I have quite a bit.

3064
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:33,780
Steak too juicy.

3065
03:08:34,380 --> 03:08:34,380
Exactly.

3066
03:08:34,720 --> 03:08:34,900
Takizo!

3067
03:08:35,500 --> 03:08:36,380
Thank you for the fun, Keto.

3068
03:08:36,880 --> 03:08:37,180
Thank you!

3069
03:08:37,780 --> 03:08:40,080
Pretty sure Control has an Alan Wake DLC.

3070
03:08:40,620 --> 03:08:40,620
Oh!

3071
03:08:41,960 --> 03:08:43,200
Also, welcome back, Kiyoki.

3072
03:08:44,440 --> 03:08:46,400
Running away from child support like Virgil.

3073
03:08:47,400 --> 03:08:48,240
How disappointing.

3074
03:08:48,980 --> 03:08:50,820
Where's your child's abhor?

3075
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:52,480
He never says that.

3076
03:08:53,860 --> 03:08:54,400
He is never.

3077
03:08:56,380 --> 03:08:57,900
Near, far.

3078
03:09:00,020 --> 03:09:01,440
Have you ever listened to that song?

3079
03:09:02,360 --> 03:09:08,160
And then she says, I believe that the heart does.

3080
03:09:08,840 --> 03:09:11,740
You know, she says the heart does, but it kind of sounds
like hot dog.

3081
03:09:12,640 --> 03:09:18,700
I believe that the hot dog goes on.

3082
03:09:23,540 --> 03:09:25,480
Kinda sounds like a hot dog.

3083
03:09:28,380 --> 03:09:31,140
Because she kind of says heart like hot.

3084
03:09:31,940 --> 03:09:32,240
Heart.

3085
03:09:33,860 --> 03:09:34,800
And then dog.

3086
03:09:35,700 --> 03:09:37,800
She doesn't really announce her at the, oohs.

3087
03:09:38,700 --> 03:09:39,300
Oohs.

3088
03:09:40,340 --> 03:09:40,640
Oohs.

3089
03:09:41,480 --> 03:09:41,660
Oohs.

3090
03:09:41,940 --> 03:09:42,400
Oohs.

3091
03:09:44,760 --> 03:09:45,360
Oohs.

3092
03:09:45,360 --> 03:09:46,140
Hot dog.

3093
03:09:46,320 --> 03:09:46,480
Hot dog.

3094
03:09:46,860 --> 03:09:48,080
Thanks for the hot dogs.

3095
03:09:50,740 --> 03:09:53,020
I'm black now, I've only seen you wide.

3096
03:09:53,160 --> 03:09:54,320
This is my goth mode.

3097
03:09:54,900 --> 03:09:55,540
How do you feel?

3098
03:09:56,440 --> 03:09:57,600
Do we like goth, minky?

3099
03:09:58,180 --> 03:10:00,420
Well, it's less... It is like a dark mode.

3100
03:10:01,160 --> 03:10:02,300
Let's goth, maybe.

3101
03:10:02,500 --> 03:10:03,860
I don't know.

3102
03:10:06,180 --> 03:10:08,200
See you on DocuStream, yeah!

3103
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:09,460
See you there!

3104
03:10:10,180 --> 03:10:12,300
Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog, hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.

3105
03:10:14,320 --> 03:10:15,940
I kind of want a burger today.

3106
03:10:16,160 --> 03:10:17,840
I kind of want...

3107
03:10:17,840 --> 03:10:19,260
Five guys.

3108
03:10:20,780 --> 03:10:22,040
It's different.

3109
03:10:24,180 --> 03:10:26,380
Purple Minto coming back?

3110
03:10:26,760 --> 03:10:28,360
I mean, I could always...

3111
03:10:31,380 --> 03:10:32,400
It's weird.

3112
03:10:32,580 --> 03:10:32,820
Whoa!

3113
03:10:33,200 --> 03:10:34,020
I glitched!

3114
03:10:34,280 --> 03:10:35,280
I glitched for real!

3115
03:10:36,120 --> 03:10:36,900
That was freaky.

3116
03:10:37,600 --> 03:10:38,160
Never mind.

3117
03:10:38,800 --> 03:10:39,500
It doesn't work.

3118
03:10:42,800 --> 03:10:44,080
It doesn't work.

3119
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:44,660
Sorry.

3120
03:10:45,900 --> 03:10:47,260
It died my bangs.

3121
03:10:50,700 --> 03:10:53,340
You're telling me it took five guys to make this burger?

3122
03:10:53,780 --> 03:10:55,300
What is your favorite burger joint?

3123
03:10:55,720 --> 03:10:58,220
My favorite burger joint is actually a local place.

3124
03:10:58,900 --> 03:11:00,620
So I can't say because it's not a chain.

3125
03:11:01,780 --> 03:11:04,780
It's like a little tiny place that I really like that.

3126
03:11:04,880 --> 03:11:06,000
I'm like, Kappa, Kappa, Kappa.

3127
03:11:07,160 --> 03:11:08,860
Why is your hot dog a three?

3128
03:11:09,680 --> 03:11:11,020
Wait, why is your sparkly?

3129
03:11:11,720 --> 03:11:12,880
What did you put in it?

3130
03:11:14,320 --> 03:11:15,400
What a burger?

3131
03:11:15,740 --> 03:11:17,080
Oh, yeah, what a burger.

3132
03:11:18,860 --> 03:11:20,340
My favorite is local two.

3133
03:11:25,590 --> 03:11:26,870
Foster Freeze

3134
03:11:29,910 --> 03:11:44,070
Local place Fudruckers What a name I like in and out But the
fries suck Okay wait a second I like in and out too And I

3135
03:11:44,070 --> 03:11:55,290

03:11:56,910 --> 03:11:57,370
What's the word?

3138
03:11:58,350 --> 03:12:00,210
I think I've become like...

03:12:00,870 --> 03:12:01,570

No.

3141
03:12:03,310 --> 03:12:04,030

03:12:04,030 --> 03:12:04,790
Homestuck.

3143
03:12:05,070 --> 03:12:06,330
No, not homestuck.

3144
03:12:07,410 --> 03:12:08,130

03:13:42,630 --> 03:13:44,250
Burger funds for dark mode, Minky.

3161
03:13:44,750 --> 03:13:46,550
Also, sorry to be a bother, but can I please get out?

3162
03:13:46,650 --> 03:13:48,230
This is not a bother at all!

3163
03:13:53,670 --> 03:13:53,750
Happy!

3164
03:13:57,810 --> 03:13:59,830
Stockholm Syndrome, like the city in Sweden.

3165
03:14:00,450 --> 03:14:00,850
Sorry.

3166
03:14:03,570 --> 03:14:05,250
I don't know what's wrong with my brain.

3167
03:14:05,530 --> 03:14:06,090
Hot take.

3168
03:14:06,270 --> 03:14:08,670
I love AMC popcorn, but only when it's stale.

3169
03:14:09,230 --> 03:14:10,650
Not a fan for fresh popcorn.

3170
03:14:12,190 --> 03:14:13,190
That's not hot take.

3171
03:14:13,670 --> 03:14:16,530
Actually, though, I love movie theater popcorn when it's
fresh.

3172
03:14:17,150 --> 03:14:21,630
No, I love movie theater popcorn when it's soggy with
butter.

3173
03:14:22,590 --> 03:14:26,450
For the record, let the record show Minto is homestuck for
fries.

3174
03:14:29,010 --> 03:14:32,830
I love movie theater popcorn when it's soggy with butter.

3175
03:14:33,190 --> 03:14:33,950
Oh, so good.

3176
03:14:35,530 --> 03:14:36,170
What am I doing?

3177
03:14:36,350 --> 03:14:36,630
Evan!

3178
03:14:37,250 --> 03:14:41,750
Evan, you terrible and wonderful creature the way that you
are.

3179
03:14:42,090 --> 03:14:42,690
Thank you.

3180
03:14:44,370 --> 03:14:45,890
Nothing's wrong with your brain.

3181
03:14:46,670 --> 03:14:48,830
There's something a little wrong with my brain, maybe.

3182
03:14:49,670 --> 03:14:51,150
You disgust me.

3183
03:14:52,410 --> 03:14:52,790
Good.

3184
03:14:53,730 --> 03:14:54,250
Good.

3185
03:14:55,230 --> 03:14:57,310
I want you to think that I'm terrible.

3186
03:15:00,850 --> 03:15:02,190
Think I'm terrible.

3187
03:15:02,630 --> 03:15:03,690
And also get worse.

3188
03:15:07,310 --> 03:15:15,230

chat and shiny it's been like this for years but that one's

3190
03:15:31,920 --> 03:15:41,660

the movies in a long time until I went and saw the recent

3191
03:15:41,660 --> 03:15:53,000
Wicked and then I got I got a movie popcorn and I was like
can I get some butter on that and they were like oh yeah it

3192
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:53,720

03:16:23,800 --> 03:16:32,600
whatever is wrong with me and dough is right for me I love
the way and minto's brain works except when it's being mean

3196
03:16:32,600 --> 03:16:34,840
to her or Metsch's Homestuck.

3197
03:16:36,780 --> 03:16:38,640
Was Homestuck any good, though?

3198
03:16:38,700 --> 03:16:45,780
Like, now that we can reflect on it, was it actually good
and we just didn't like, and just the fandom was kind of

3199
03:16:45,780 --> 03:16:46,240
cringe?

3200
03:16:46,660 --> 03:16:51,120
Or was it, like, I don't know, I've never read it or
anything.

3201
03:16:52,460 --> 03:16:52,980
Careful.

3202
03:16:55,660 --> 03:16:56,800
It was all right.

3203
03:16:56,940 --> 03:16:57,720
It was unique.

3204
03:17:00,760 --> 03:17:01,620
Like, you...

3205
03:17:03,100 --> 03:17:05,360
I think we talked about this before.

3206
03:17:05,660 --> 03:17:09,120
You had to, like, you have to have read it with the flash,
right?

3207
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:10,200
Or something?

3208
03:17:13,980 --> 03:17:18,060
Never burden anyone with knowing about Homestuck or
Vivzipop.

3209
03:17:19,940 --> 03:17:20,960
It's a burden.

3210
03:17:21,160 --> 03:17:26,200
This knowledge, I have to carry it with me every day.

3211
03:17:26,660 --> 03:17:32,700
For the rest of my afterlife, I have to carry this knowledge
of Homestuck and Vivzipop.

3212
03:17:33,680 --> 03:17:39,440
I remember one time I was at an anime convention and it was
like maybe one, two in the morning.

3213
03:17:39,580 --> 03:17:48,940
It was quite late and I was walking with my friends and I
quite remember very vividly seeing a circle of homestuck

3214
03:17:48,940 --> 03:17:49,840
cosplayers.

3215
03:17:50,040 --> 03:17:54,000
They were like, and you knew they were homestucks because
they were gray.

3216
03:17:54,360 --> 03:17:56,880
They had like the gray paint on them, the body paint.

3217
03:17:56,880 --> 03:18:04,120
And they were surrounding a guy who was passed out drunk on
the floor.

3218
03:18:06,280 --> 03:18:09,940
And my first thought was, oh no!

3219
03:18:11,080 --> 03:18:12,520
Homestuck cosplayers!

3220
03:18:12,760 --> 03:18:14,780
Then my second thought was, oh no!

3221
03:18:15,240 --> 03:18:17,620
I hope that guy is okay!

3222
03:18:18,440 --> 03:18:21,720
And I sure hope that they called for help!

3223
03:18:28,250 --> 03:18:32,150
That's a guy that's passed out drunk On the floor

3224
03:18:37,990 --> 03:18:44,770
Circling him like vultures They were like singing They were
like holding hands And like singing something around this

3225
03:18:44,770 --> 03:18:53,950
guy Like they were doing a ritual to him I hope that guy's
okay today If you ever do the thing I recommend with the

3226
03:18:53,950 --> 03:18:54,550
Orville oil.

3227
03:18:54,670 --> 03:18:56,050
It has an ANC bag of popcorn.

3228
03:18:56,190 --> 03:18:56,850
Be a bit careful.

3229
03:18:57,330 --> 03:18:59,850
You don't need as much of the Orville oil as the theater
stuff.

3230
03:19:00,370 --> 03:19:01,010
Thank you, Dargo.

3231
03:19:01,130 --> 03:19:02,390
I remember you mentioning that.

3232
03:19:02,490 --> 03:19:03,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3233
03:19:04,930 --> 03:19:06,650
Back in my day, I went to an anime convention.

3234
03:19:06,750 --> 03:19:09,130
I got smacked with a yaoi paddle and got glomped.

3235
03:19:09,810 --> 03:19:10,610
Good times.

3236
03:19:11,470 --> 03:19:12,590
I'm gonna glompe you.

3237
03:19:12,810 --> 03:19:13,910
I'm gonna glompe you.

3238
03:19:14,770 --> 03:19:16,190
Valid order of emergencies.

3239
03:19:18,670 --> 03:19:20,810
They definitely sacrificed that, dude.

3240
03:19:21,630 --> 03:19:21,890
Oh.

3241
03:19:22,650 --> 03:19:35,110
Like, those two girls those girls that tried to sacrifice
that girl that other girl for slender man like that's a real

3242
03:19:35,110 --> 03:19:49,090
that's a real like uh what's the word a real crime didn't
she escape yeah she was hardcore they like they they like

3243
03:19:49,090 --> 03:19:57,870
thought they killed her and she crawled back to like get
help it's actually so messed up she survived it's amazing

3244
03:19:57,870 --> 03:20:05,930
she was so hardcore yeah they stabbed her a ton and now the
girls i think they're like still in custody or something

3245
03:20:07,530 --> 03:20:15,690
it's really badass that she survived like so cool that she
not cool that she got stabbed obviously but like so cool

3246
03:20:15,690 --> 03:20:22,850
that her like will to live was so strong like oh my god it
was a quite a long time ago.

3247
03:20:24,690 --> 03:20:25,830
No, the girl didn't die.

3248
03:20:26,070 --> 03:20:26,650
She lived.

3249
03:20:29,390 --> 03:20:31,330
One tried to escape recently!

3250
03:20:32,070 --> 03:20:32,850
That's scary.

3251
03:20:33,370 --> 03:20:37,590
Do you think they probably don't believe in Slender Man
anymore, right?

3252
03:20:38,210 --> 03:20:38,570
I hope.

3253
03:20:39,970 --> 03:20:40,390
I hope.

3254
03:20:42,010 --> 03:20:42,270
I hope.

3255
03:20:44,650 --> 03:20:45,170
Scary.

3256
03:20:46,230 --> 03:20:47,030
Was that a real story?

3257
03:20:47,230 --> 03:20:48,370
It was, it was, yeah.

3258
03:20:49,510 --> 03:20:51,930
Did she have a lightning bolt-shaped scar?

3259
03:20:51,950 --> 03:20:53,570
The girl who lived.

3260
03:20:57,850 --> 03:21:01,250
It burns every time she thinks of Slender Man.

3261
03:21:03,890 --> 03:21:03,970
Oh.

3262
03:21:04,970 --> 03:21:06,550
That's pretty freaky, though.

3263
03:21:07,890 --> 03:21:07,950
Ah.

3264
03:21:08,890 --> 03:21:09,890
Slender Man.

3265
03:21:11,690 --> 03:21:12,890
Slender Man.

3266
03:21:13,970 --> 03:21:15,270
Collect my pages.

3267
03:21:16,470 --> 03:21:17,650
He said collect the pages.

3268
03:21:17,830 --> 03:21:20,110
He didn't say murder a person.

3269
03:21:22,670 --> 03:21:23,430
Come on!

3270
03:21:23,910 --> 03:21:25,090
Get the lore right!

3271
03:21:25,210 --> 03:21:25,930
Come on, guys!

3272
03:21:28,650 --> 03:21:29,970
Spread my pages!

3273
03:21:30,550 --> 03:21:31,790
Spread my code!

3274
03:21:39,210 --> 03:21:41,270
Oh, I want to go on the Tron ride again.

3275
03:21:41,350 --> 03:21:42,150
It was pretty fun.

3276
03:21:42,530 --> 03:21:43,530
Even though it was so short.

3277
03:21:43,950 --> 03:21:44,670
It was pretty fun.

3278
03:21:47,330 --> 03:21:48,470
What is his lore?

3279
03:21:48,670 --> 03:21:49,770
He's just a long guy.

3280
03:21:49,870 --> 03:21:50,370
I don't know.

3281
03:21:50,450 --> 03:21:53,970
I think he like kidnaps Children or something too?

3282
03:21:54,790 --> 03:21:55,650
But there was like always that.

3283
03:21:55,710 --> 03:21:56,870
I always think of that one.

3284
03:21:56,970 --> 03:22:04,550
Like one of the first photos of him that emerged was like
the one of him like in the playground or whatever.

3285
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:07,630
Right?

3286
03:22:07,950 --> 03:22:08,190
Something?

3287
03:22:08,790 --> 03:22:09,330
I don't know.

3288
03:22:09,410 --> 03:22:11,230
I feel like the lore is all messed up.

3289
03:22:11,510 --> 03:22:14,930
There was never like an established lore or something,
right?

3290
03:22:15,110 --> 03:22:18,870
Because where does he get his suits?

3291
03:22:18,950 --> 03:22:19,710
Who's his tailor?

3292
03:22:20,810 --> 03:22:21,890
He does it himself.

3293
03:22:23,690 --> 03:22:26,530
Marble Hornets is the only lore I remember.

3294
03:22:27,990 --> 03:22:29,030
Yeah, something.

3295
03:22:29,610 --> 03:22:36,270
I mean, I know it was like the Photoshop of him happened,
and then there was like the creepypastas made from him.

3296
03:22:37,890 --> 03:22:42,970
He's supposed to appear in urban environments too, so it
always bothered me that the popular game was based in the

3297
03:22:42,970 --> 03:22:43,830
woods.

3298
03:22:45,570 --> 03:22:50,870
Um, actually, my Slender Man would appear in the city.

3299
03:22:51,950 --> 03:22:54,390
Actually, Slender Man is in Tokyo right now.

3300
03:22:55,990 --> 03:22:56,370
Imagine.

3301
03:22:56,750 --> 03:22:57,590
Oh my gosh, wait.

3302
03:22:58,070 --> 03:23:02,350
That'd be a great idea for what's it called?

3303
03:23:03,810 --> 03:23:04,650
Chilla's art.

3304
03:23:04,910 --> 03:23:07,670
They can make their own slender set in Japan.

3305
03:23:08,870 --> 03:23:10,590
Slender, the eight pages, bring it back.

3306
03:23:13,370 --> 03:23:14,470
Bring it back.

3307
03:23:15,450 --> 03:23:20,670
I wonder how like, not fun, but I bet playing that game
nowadays is like pretty iconic.

3308
03:23:22,890 --> 03:23:28,350
It's like, wow, this is where, like, page collection games
started, you know?

3309
03:23:29,250 --> 03:23:31,110
He was in the woods for glamping.

3310
03:23:33,450 --> 03:23:37,410
He probably had a really nice, like, what do you say?

3311
03:23:37,450 --> 03:23:40,950
Like, uh, like, uh, um...

3312
03:23:41,690 --> 03:23:44,870
He probably was going to do, like, a nice engagement or
something.

3313
03:23:46,510 --> 03:23:48,010
He had his suit on.

3314
03:23:48,550 --> 03:23:49,630
He was ready.

3315
03:23:52,270 --> 03:24:05,430
nobody showed up and he's really sad the tall lady oh what's
her name Hachi Shaku Sama or whatever what's her name Hachi

3316
03:24:07,110 --> 03:24:20,450
Hachi Shaku Sama yeah I was right her and Slenderman are
were were to be engaged and he had a suit on to propose and

3317
03:24:20,450 --> 03:24:23,510
she rejected him and now he's really sad.

3318
03:24:29,620 --> 03:24:30,300
That's the lore.

3319
03:24:34,060 --> 03:24:35,340
Dimidom.

3320
03:24:37,300 --> 03:24:38,480
Wait, how do you say her name?

3321
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:38,880
Dim.

3322
03:24:41,620 --> 03:24:42,420
Demitrescu.

3323
03:24:47,260 --> 03:24:48,060
Demitrescu.

3324
03:24:55,410 --> 03:24:56,210
Demitrescu.

3325
03:25:00,790 --> 03:25:02,390
The U is silent.

3326

I just Googled Hachishaku-sama.

3333
03:25:46,660 --> 03:25:48,100
I was looking at images of her.

3334
03:25:49,140 --> 03:25:49,200

3335
03:25:49,740 --> 03:25:50,140

3339
03:25:57,040 --> 03:25:59,280
This is on Wattpad.

3340
03:26:00,300 --> 03:26:01,760
No stinking way.

3341
03:26:02,340 --> 03:26:03,880
Nothing is an original thought.

3342
03:26:06,080 --> 03:26:18,780

small shadow forming on my face because of my white straw

3345
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:36,560
hat I smiled.

3346
03:26:36,960 --> 03:26:40,300
A wonderful place where anything and everything exists.

3347
03:26:40,580 --> 03:26:41,780
You can do whatever you want.

3348
03:26:41,980 --> 03:26:42,800
Wait, when do they meet?

3349
03:26:44,760 --> 03:26:45,960
Oh, here, here, here.

3350
03:26:46,620 --> 03:26:47,120
Oh, my God.

3351
03:26:48,740 --> 03:26:50,360
I stopped in the middle of a clearing.

3352
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:51,860
Where are we, Hachi?

3353
03:26:52,520 --> 03:26:56,200
I stay silent as a static noise begins to echo through the
woods.

3354
03:26:56,540 --> 03:26:58,020
I've never heard this noise before.

3355
03:26:58,460 --> 03:26:59,620
When am I gonna get to go?

3356
03:26:59,900 --> 03:27:04,260
Silence, I demanded in my deep voice, which was deeper than
a fully grown male.

3357
03:27:05,900 --> 03:27:06,700
Who wrote...

3358
03:27:06,700 --> 03:27:07,700
Is this supposed to be...

3359
03:27:07,700 --> 03:27:09,500
I can't tell if this is supposed to be serious or not.

3360
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:10,900
The static continued.

3361
03:27:11,180 --> 03:27:13,500
My eyes darted around, my head not moving.

3362
03:27:13,860 --> 03:27:15,400
Hachi, the young girl, asked.

3363
03:27:15,660 --> 03:27:18,780
I looked down to see her tilting her head as someone in
front of us.

3364
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:19,740
I look up.

3365
03:27:19,900 --> 03:27:21,480
I see a pale white man.

3366
03:27:21,680 --> 03:27:23,560
He has no face and is wearing a suit.

3367
03:27:23,860 --> 03:27:27,260
He seemed to be a few inches taller than me, but I didn't
think much of it.

3368
03:27:27,520 --> 03:27:28,620
I raised an eyebrow.

3369
03:27:28,900 --> 03:27:31,740
He seemed to be coming closer and closer.

3370
03:27:32,460 --> 03:27:34,820
I stand there, the girl trembling in my hand.

3371
03:27:34,840 --> 03:27:44,980
but then she stops I look back down at the girl to see her
giggling she looks up at me is this your husband Hachi how

3372
03:27:44,980 --> 03:27:56,960
many chapters is this this chapter 1 how many chapters next

3373
03:28:00,050 --> 03:28:18,990
part chapter 2 chapter 3 chapter 4 wait hold on maybe if I
on their their wet pad how many chapters is it oh it's only

3374
03:28:18,990 --> 03:28:27,290
four chapters how disappointing I thought this was going to
be like you know like their die-hard ship you know what I

3375
03:28:27,290 --> 03:28:38,670
mean I didn't know I wanted Minto fanfic audio readings it
It needs to be a manua or something.

3376
03:28:40,710 --> 03:28:41,490
The magic number.

3377
03:28:41,950 --> 03:28:42,590
Wait, you're right.

3378
03:28:42,730 --> 03:28:44,390
That is a spooky number now, isn't it?

3379
03:28:44,530 --> 03:28:46,610
But it should be 44, at least.

3380
03:28:48,350 --> 03:28:49,290
I wonder how it ends.

3381
03:28:49,690 --> 03:28:50,370
Hold on.

3382
03:28:50,730 --> 03:28:53,050
Wait, chapter 4 is meeting Slender Man.

3383
03:28:53,610 --> 03:28:53,810
What?

3384
03:28:54,390 --> 03:28:55,490
That doesn't make much sense.

3385
03:29:03,080 --> 03:29:03,960
He sighs.

3386
03:29:04,360 --> 03:29:06,140
They refer to me as Slender Man.

3387
03:29:06,460 --> 03:29:08,720
Though the creepypastas call me other things.

3388
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:10,780
Which I will not say, for they are true.

3389
03:29:10,800 --> 03:29:11,920
truly ridiculous.

3390
03:29:14,000 --> 03:29:16,360
Minto audiobook, please, please, please.

3391
03:29:17,780 --> 03:29:23,360
If somebody, I feel like I probably couldn't do that because
of copyright.

3392
03:29:30,930 --> 03:29:33,790
I don't like the, I don't like how meta this is.

3393
03:29:34,290 --> 03:29:37,270
They call me, they call me Slenderman.

3394
03:29:42,320 --> 03:29:46,740
If you are tired of too many games, you should read some fix
on stream and be peak.

3395
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:48,160
Maybe.

3396
03:29:51,080 --> 03:29:51,400
Yeah!

3397
03:29:52,920 --> 03:29:54,940
Slender Man breeds his own creepy pastas.

3398
03:29:55,100 --> 03:29:55,980
That's so cringe.

3399
03:29:56,280 --> 03:29:58,440
That means Slender Man is like Googling himself.

3400
03:29:59,280 --> 03:30:00,480
That's so... Oh my gosh.

3401
03:30:00,620 --> 03:30:04,560
What is it called when you like search yourself or whatever?

3402
03:30:06,060 --> 03:30:07,320
That's so cringe.

3403
03:30:08,700 --> 03:30:10,540
Forgot to mention I sent some videos of Gumbas.

3404
03:30:10,660 --> 03:30:11,400
Oh yeah!

3405
03:30:11,540 --> 03:30:12,900
I saw them cover!

3406
03:30:13,480 --> 03:30:14,660
I saw the Gumbas.

3407
03:30:14,820 --> 03:30:15,720
I love his eyes.

3408
03:30:17,280 --> 03:30:19,160
Yeah, ego-searching, ego-searching!

3409
03:30:19,880 --> 03:30:21,500
He's ego-searching himself.

3410
03:30:22,060 --> 03:30:22,960
That's cringe.

3411
03:30:23,100 --> 03:30:23,880
Oh my god.

3412
03:30:26,380 --> 03:30:28,880
Come on, come on.

3413
03:30:29,260 --> 03:30:29,860
Slenderman.

3414
03:30:30,440 --> 03:30:33,140
He's like, I wonder what fanfics are about me today.

3415
03:30:36,760 --> 03:30:38,640
I can't search myself.

3416
03:30:38,820 --> 03:30:53,800
If you search Mint, obviously, like, my name is, like, you
know, not only just a color, but also, uh a crypto so the so

3417
03:30:53,800 --> 03:31:07,640
all i get if i were to search mint is like oh yeah this is
uh a minted uh something something coin about uh about uh

3418
03:31:07,640 --> 03:31:20,560
this is this is this is duck coin minted today Sacred and
terrible air The book Disco Elysium is based on Would be a

3419
03:31:20,560 --> 03:31:27,300
good read on stream Oh my goodness Reading though I don't
mind it It's like doing a visual novel Might be kind of

3420
03:31:27,300 --> 03:31:41,640

Mint Mobile, the cell phone service, so it's impossible for

3423
03:31:53,980 --> 03:31:58,000

Someone out there's a real auntie.

3426

They're just like, I hope she sees this when ego searching.

3427
03:32:09,100 --> 03:32:10,320
I don't see anything.

03:38:01,850 --> 03:38:04,430
Let's see if she has a thing up.

3489
03:38:09,250 --> 03:38:10,370
Oh, there she does.

3490
03:38:20,470 --> 03:38:22,230
Okay, we'll read into that.

3491
03:38:22,370 --> 03:38:23,290
Thank you, everyone!

3492
03:38:23,410 --> 03:38:24,250
Bye-bye!

3493
03:38:24,430 --> 03:38:24,850
Otomito!

3494
03:38:25,210 --> 03:38:26,650
Oh, my tummy is growling.

3495
03:38:27,090 --> 03:38:27,510
Otomito!

3496
03:38:27,650 --> 03:38:27,890
Otomito!

3497
03:38:27,990 --> 03:38:28,390
Otomito!

3498
03:38:28,510 --> 03:38:29,170

3499
03:38:29,310 --> 03:38:29,550
Bye-bye!

3500

Bye-bye!
