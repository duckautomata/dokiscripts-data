Always pays her rent on time.

63
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:06,310
As I was saying, Al, I found all sorts of weird stuff from
the local newspapers' archives.

64
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,090
Where are you going?

65
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,110
This place is crazy.

66
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,470
Where are you going?

67
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,710

Barry, don't avoid me.

73
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:22,970
most of this stuff takes place around Cauldron Lake well you
ain't wrong mister the Indians thought the lake was a

74
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:30,710
doorway to the underworld I'm the god-fearing type myself I
don't hold with that sort of thing yeah okay anyway let me

75
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:36,990
speak please there was an island there owned by a guy called
Thomas Zane now some of the articles I found about him make

76
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:45,390
him out to be a famous writer but I ran a bunch of searches
couldn't find a single thing he wrote he's a writer just

77
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:53,630
like me the place came to be called diver's aisle but the
volcano under the lake erupted in 1970 and zane went i think

78
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:05,270
we almost got buried to go full owl come on okay yes this

from rose uh she's the girl who works at the diner and she

80
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:19,150

00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,150
Actually, I don't remember why, but Wake and Barry have
arrived at the trailer park to meet Rose, who says she has

83
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,450
Wake's manuscript.

84
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,830
That's what she said.

85
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,950

86
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,930

Okay, I'm exploring a little bit.

Why do they hate nature?

98
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,230

Did I do that?

110
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,350
This is the inspiration for my next novel!

111
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,490
Wait, did I do that?

112
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:05,970

131
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,290
Very cool.

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,510
All right, I'm gonna leave you.

And I'm gonna go do my own thing again.

134
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:52,290
I just like looking around.

135
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,550
It's so interesting.

136
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,110
Spector!

137
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,630
Welcome to a bamboo ship.

138
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,330
Thank you.

139
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,770
Sorry if my voice is a little hoarse.

140
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,550
Yeah, how about that?

141
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,690
It was there in the morning, as if it had fallen from the
sky.

142
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,750
But it would take a tornado to lift something like that.

143
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,190
We're damn lucky it didn't crush any of the trailers.

144
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,310
What the heck?

145
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,950
A whole boat!

146
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,410
Why?

147
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,520
Is it because I stole?

148
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,380
I'm so sorry.

149
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,640
What's that sound?

150
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,740
Is that a vacuum?

151
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,560
Hello?

152
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,680
Someone's working?

153
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,600
Let me know if the volume is too loud or not later on.

154
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,840
It probably will be too loud.

155
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,800
I like how Barry just follows me anywhere.

156
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,780
Probably will be too loud later because I have it like all
the way up right now.

157
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,480
Especially when I'm shooting.

158
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,720
Randy's dogs.

159
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,580
But there's a dog right there.

160
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,460
Okay.

161
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,880
I'm following, I'm following.

162
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,340
I'm following, I'm following.

163
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,600
Aren't those wasps?

164
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,620
No, I think you sound like a vacuum, yeah.

165
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,710
Wait, what's this?

166
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,700
Dogs.

167
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,660
Hot dog.

168
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,400
Chili dog.

169
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,480
Corn dog.

170
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,280
Taco dog.

171
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,260
A taco?

172
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,320
Look at these prices even.

173
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,860
These are Costco prices.

174
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,720
The famous dog.

175
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,340
Big dog.

176
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,220
Monster dog.

177
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,760
Belly buster.

178
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,560
Ew.

179
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:40,000
I thought the trailer trash dog was $82 for a second.

180
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,820
Special plates.

181
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,860
Crash, thank you so much for the 20.

182
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,740
Yes, thank you.

183
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,720
What the dog doing?

184
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,760
Rabbit food.

185
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,520
Salad.

186
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,620
Salad.

187
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:54,580
With chicken.

188
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,660
With chicken.

189
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,520
What is this menu?

190
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,280
With chicken.

191
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:08,120
Small side salad, extra dressing, extra fix-ins, just ask
for.

192
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,140
Rabbit food.

193
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,760
You're okay, I'm coming, I'm coming, sorry.

194
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,560
She is far out here, isn't she?

195
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,640
Oh, are we...

196
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,080
This isn't trespassing, is it?

197
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,580
It gets better.

198
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,120
A local girl, Barbara Jagger, drowned in Cauldron Lake just
a week earlier.

199
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,080
Whoa.

200
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,880
Jagger's a local spook store.

201
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,460
The scratch and hag.

202
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,300
Scratch and hag!

203
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:42,920
Come for you in the dark.

204
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,580
Childish stuff like that.

205
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,300
Anyway, Al.

206
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm just getting to the best part.

207
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,960
All of the articles about this stuff were written by Cynthia
Weaver.

208
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,920
Cynthia Weaver.

209
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,980
I asked around, and she's that crazy bad lady you met.

210
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:56,620
Oh!

211
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:56,940
What?

212
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,840
The lamp lady?

213
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,860
She can be a little loopy, but she's not homeless anymore.

214
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,220
Yeah.

215
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,200
Anyway, she knew both Jagger and Zane before they both died.

216
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,280
and she had some kind of a breakdown.

217
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,160
I like how he waited all of this time to continue the story.

218
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,420
Note that all the Stucky's favorite dogs he mentioned are
the largest portions.

219
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,420
One big Tao, please, me Tao.

220
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,540
Coming right up.

221
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,640
Where is the person that is chopping wood?

222
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,680
I hear them still.

223
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,780
What if you think it's like a speaker in the woods?

224
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,660
a belly burster

225
00:19:46,600 --> 00:20:00,620
can I ride this you can make so much noise I love it okay
alright I'm following you I'm following you so the mystery

226
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:09,200
chopper well mister this here's Rose's trailer you mind me
asking what you want with her we're just here to talk to her

227
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,300
pal This doesn't seem intimidating at all.

228
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,540
We're just here to talk to her.

229
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,320
Pow.

230
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,040
I see a thermos in there.

231
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,020
Okay, I'm gonna rob Rose now.

232
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,440
Excuse me.

233
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,730
Where do you think she was hiding?

234
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,010
Welcome to...

235
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:32,610
To...

236
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,330
Oh, dear.

237
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,810
Mr. Wake.

238
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,290
I'm...

239
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,050
I'm so glad you're here.

240
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,950
Rose, you have my manuscript?

241
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,070
Oh.

242
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,550
Oh, yes.

243
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:43,830
Yes.

244
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,090
Please come in.

245
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,310
This doesn't seem suspicious at all.

246
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:48,950
Oh, my God.

247
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,890
Don't drink it.

248
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,090
Hey, this is really good.

249
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,070
Rose.

250
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:55,070
Yes.

251
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,050
My manuscript.

252
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:57,530
I really need it.

253
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:58,370
I understand.

254
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,250
I know what you need.

255
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,470
Amuse to inspire you.

256
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,670
Oh, for Barry.

257
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,550
She doesn't have anything.

258
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:06,050
Yeah.

259
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:07,770
Uh, hey, Al.

260
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,030
How was... Oh.

261
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,190
Barry!

262
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,270
What?

263
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:15,350
Oh no.

264
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,410
Oh, I told you guys not to drink it.

265
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,990
Oh man.

266
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,970
Who could have thunk this would happen?

267
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,790
He's not Alan Wake anymore!

268
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,510
It's coming for you.

269
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,390
Hiding in my barber's skin.

270
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,190
Oh my gosh, so loud.

271
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,430
I'm too weak to stop it.

272
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:39,990
You must turn the lights on.

273
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,930
Turn the lights on.

274
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,750
I promised I'd come visit you and your lovely wife.

275
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:47,430
Helen sweet.

276
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:48,870
Helen sweet.

277
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:49,650
You must find what you started.

278
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,810
I insist.

279
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,830
You must turn the lights on.

280
00:21:57,210 --> 00:21:58,510
Turn the lights on.

281
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,210
Turn the light on.

282
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:01,850
Ooh!

283
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,590
Back to work, boy.

284
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:05,930
Ah!

285
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:12,020
Is that me above her bed?

286
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:29,140
turn the lights on oh my god I can't tell reality from dream
anymore but it seems I have an imaginary editor to help me

287
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:37,460
she's an old woman in a funeral dress I call her Barbara
Jagger Barbara her name is Barbara and faster my manuscript

288
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,640
is being heavily revised the edits are getting very
aggressive each day there's less of me and more of her I

289
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,340
hate it But I know she's right.

290
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,080
What do you mean?

291
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,400
She promises me I can save Alice this way.

292
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,980
She knows more of this than I do.

293
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,400
Barba.

294
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,580
About the complex incantation I'm attempting.

295
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:55,880
About this place.

296
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,020
She's worked with another writer under similar
circumstances.

297
00:22:59,620 --> 00:22:59,920
Thomas Zane.

298
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
The genre of the story seems to be shifting.

299
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,660
It's turning into a horror story.

300
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,920
I'm getting close.

301
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,180
I can feel it.

302
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,700
Ooh.

303
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,120
Spooky.

304
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,840
The tone is shifting.

305
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,100
Oh my goodness.

306
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:31,640
look at the shades on oh wow she has so many of my books and
she has other books not a real fan am i her oshi or what

307
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:42,740
this is crazy i guess i mean this feels like this feels like
like a like a 12 year old putting justin beaver on top of

308
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:46,000
her like a you know What is that?

309
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,160
Who's that guy?

310
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,660
Believe in change.

311
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,460
Alan Oshie.

312
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,140
Rose took a day from me.

313
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,960
I had less than 12 hours left to meet the kidnapper.

314
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:04,480
All I could do was get Barry into the car, work something
out once I got on the road.

315
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,240
Thank you.

316
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,140
Barry!

317
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,160
Barry was out of it.

318
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,720
He was way too heavy to carry.

319
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,940
Oh, I thought we were supposed to get him in the car.

320
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:27,620
uh-oh you're right i deserve more money i'm so handsome uh
rose welcome to the oh dear diner oh geez what can i get you

321
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:37,600

322
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:45,680
be okay oh she's got little pictures when you like to hear
today's specials thank you I think I would hate this setup,

323
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:46,140
though.

324
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:52,300
It looks like a restaurant booth in my home.

325
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,960
I don't know about that.

326
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,920
She got a little island and everything, though.

327
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,060
It's pretty fancy.

328
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,270
All right, hold on.

329
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:08,340
Okay, it's not letting me do anything with guns yet, so I
think no combat yet.

330
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,200
Okay.

331
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,880
My gun and flashlight were gone.

332
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,780
I'd have to find a way to get Barry into the car as quickly
as possible.

333
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,540
There was no time to waste.

334
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Okay.

335
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,100
What's this?

336
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,460
My manuscript.

337
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,020
Let's see what we got here.

338
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,020
Ransom!

339
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,740
Nice Aibu Taku Collection, Rose.

340
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,720
Randolph calls the police.

341
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,040
Mr. Randolph like Rose.

342
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,660
That little smile she had.

343
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,260
How she was still sweet when life had tried so hard to make
her bitter.

344
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,240
It wasn't any of this business what she did in her trailer.

345
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,920
strangers the writer and his smart ass sidekick looked like
trouble and they've been in there for hours way past her

346
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:58,580
normal bedtime he reached for the phone and called the
sheriff's station oh no uh oh wait no no you don't

347
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:08,980
understand we're the victims here wait wait wait please
understand we are the ones who uh wait this is so bad um

348
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:19,000
okay so we can't go that way we have to get to the car Can't
go that way because of the boat that mysteriously landed.

349
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,540
Oh, what's this?

350
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,500
I just stepped outside to catch a breath of fresh air.

351
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,280
Let me tell you.

352
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,900
I keep adjusting the volume because the...

353
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,140
Nights like this make me especially glad I'm here talking to
you and not home in bed.

354
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,720
Once the weather takes a turn like this, I can't sleep at
all.

355
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,560
So how does he know we're bedtime?

356
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,260
Dead sheets and dark thoughts.

357
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:49,140
punctuated by the occasional plunge into nightmare is it
just me well perhaps it is the volume's all right on our end

358
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:56,240

Oh, there he is.

00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,830
Um, excuse me.

373
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:09,510
Excuse me, I need to leave.

374
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,630
Oh, you're gonna get it now.

375
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:14,190
Ah!

376
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:15,730
Wait!

377
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:19,350
God knows what you've done to that poor girl.

378
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,690
This is Agent Nightingale, FBI.

379
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,210
Get him up, Hemingway.

380
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,670
You're under arrest.

381
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,590
What did I do?

382
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:27,930
You have a muscle all unload right in your goddamn face.

383
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,410
Stay right where you are, Triple H.

384
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,770
Oh my god, wait, wait, why are we shooting?

385
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,790
Oh my god, you're gonna kill that guy.

386
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,950
Oh my god!

387
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,510
Oh, are we back in the woods?

388
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:44,670
No, why?

389
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,590
I'm standing right here, you goddamn maniac.

390
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:52,230
No.

391
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,610
I hated to leave Barry behind, but there was no way I'd miss
my opponent.

392
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:58,830
Escape the police?

393
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,610
Oh my god, wait.

394
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,590
How do I...

395
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,030
I gotta go this way.

396
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:11,550
Oh my god.

397
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,870
Wait, I'm in...

398
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,490
What grounds do you have to arrest me, huh?

399
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,510
Wee-woo, wee-woo.

400
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,020
Oh, shoot.

401
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,260
Wait, that doesn't seem good.

402
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,040
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

403
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,060
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

404
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,040
For acting, suss.

405
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,320
No!

406
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,840
You don't see me?

407
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,180
Not the flare.

408
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:49,680
Oh my god.

409
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,220
Oh my god.

410
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,000
Am I supposed to be stealthy here?

411
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,900
I can't tell at all.

412
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,180
Wake!

413
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,440
That's me.

414
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,060
Just gonna keep Roddick.

415
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
He needs an Allen break.

416
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:07,880
Yeah, for me.

417
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:24,660

419
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,380
read for a second pick up pick up Need to read.

420
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,880
The dark presence sleeps.

421
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,900
For decades, the darkness that wore Barbara Jagger's skin
slept thickly in the dark place that was its home and

422
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,260
prison.

423
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,300
It was hungry and in pain.

424
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,140
It dreamed of its nights of glory when the poet's writing
had called it from the depths and given it a brief, terrible

425
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,520
taste of power and freedom.

426
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,720
The rock stars had stirred it from the deep sleep the poet
had sunk it back to in the end.

427
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,840
When it sensed the writer on the ferry, it opened its eyes.

428
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:14,280
It dreamed of its nights of glory when the poet's writing
had called it from the depths and given it a brief terrible

429
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,900
taste of power and freedom.

430
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:21,100
Was the, why is the darkness so obsessed with books?

431
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,300
Work has been super busy, but I'm trying to catch up on
VODs.

432
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,160
Falling, thank you, Brother Pink.

433
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,600
Super excited for February.

434
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,160
I can't be there in person, so I'm gonna buy a stream ticket
and merch for sure.

435
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,060
Thank you!

436
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,420
Hope you have a good day.

437
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:34,880
You too!

438
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,940
You too, you too.

439
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,880
Thank you so much.

440
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:38,400
What?

441
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,920
Okay, back to running.

442
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,290
Is the darkness still sleeping?

443
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,450
The weather's getting bad.

444
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,250
Oh shoot.

445
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:54,170
Oh shoot.

446
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,140
That's not my fault.

447
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,800
Checkpoint reached.

448
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,500
Catch your breath, Alan.

449
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,920
I'm gonna go back and investigate what's going on over here.

450
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,830
Oh, what are they saying?

451
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:33,950
Over.

452
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,190
He's a loose cannon, he is.

453
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:52,870
Out.

454
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:55,390
Oh, damn.

455
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,250
Wait, there is something over here.

456
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:57,950
I'm glad I checked.

457
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:05,280
Manuscript.

458
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,580
Almost missed it.

459
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
More reading.

460
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,880
Rose visited by the dark prince.

461
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:18,380
Rose didn't know how the strange old lady got in her trailer
and she looked wrong somehow.

462
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,520
Hi Mito, hello!

463
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,880
The woman showed her teeth in an approximation of a smile
and traced a finger down Rose's cheek.

464
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:24,660
Pretty girl.

465
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,060
Her cheek pretty girl.

466
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,320
But her knees didn't buckle.

467
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,120
The crone spoke in a whisper.

468
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,280
Her words ice cold and dark in Rose's ear.

469
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,260
Ew!

470
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,020
Nasty.

471
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,420
Go away, old lady.

472
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,880
All right.

473
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,240
Crone.

474
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,980
That didn't sound very sturdy.

475
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,440
Push it over.

476
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:54,460
Yeah.

477
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,760
Alan Destroy.

478
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,880
Alan Hulk.

479
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:01,640
All right.

480
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,660
Let's keep escaping.

481
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,680
Question mark?

482
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,300
We are escaping.

483
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,220
The police, maybe.

484
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,960
What was that?

485
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:10,980
Oh, a flare.

486
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,940
Where are we even running to?

487
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,900
We don't even know.

488
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,140
We're just running.

489
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,160
Stay sharp.

490
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,300
Don't look at me.

491
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,900
Don't look up.

492
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,600
Gamers don't look up.

493
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:28,960
No.

494
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,040
No.

495
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,570
Maybe I should go to.

496
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,130
Oh!

497
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,840
I'll go around it.

498
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
That didn't seem good.

499
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,580
This horror was everywhere I went.

500
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:00,800
Circling me.

501
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,420
This is...

502
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,800
The cops didn't stand a chance.

503
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:03,980
Killing a lot of people, huh?

504
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,500
They were after a rider.

505
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:05,800
Not a monster.

506
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,080
No!

507
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,460
My lamp!

508
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,820
Please!

509
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,740
Yeah, we're like kind of really bad for this place now.

510
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,470
Over.

511
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,750
Over.

512
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,980
She called me a geek.

513
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,020
Oh.

514
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,060
We're escaping the police still?

515
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,740
We're doing it?

516
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,340
Softendo, thank you so much for the redirect!

517
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,460
Hello, hello!

518
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,180
Checkpoint reached, baby.

519
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,180
Is that a helicopter?

520
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,720
Can't be that long.

521
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,480
Hello?

522
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,420
It's coming from that the way.

523
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,520
Raymag, thank you so much for the captain!

524
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:21,560
Oh.

525
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,000
Oh, shoot!

526
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:27,940
It didn't seem, man.

527
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:28,980
Fine.

528
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,400
Oh my god.

529
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,560
Wait, what is that?

530
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,060
The birds are after him!

531
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,160
Wait, how did that happen?

532
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,580
The birds!

533
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,840
They're spitting seeds or something.

534
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,320
Oh my god!

535
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,060
Man down, man down!

536
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,940
Okay, so there's an open door here, but obviously I want to
go up.

537
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,700
Oh my god!

538
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,380
Holy cow!

539
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,100
Ducky, thank you so much for the...

540
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:18,540
For the gifted!

541
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,480
Uh, zoom?

542
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,780
Oh my god.

543
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,860
Oh, it's sensitive.

544
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,440
Is that the gas station we were at before that we, like,
made our way to?

545
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,380
Uh, a while ago?

546
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,180
First chapter?

547
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,820
Maybe different gas station?

548
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,480
Can't imagine there's so many...

549
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,540
No way!

550
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,500
Thermus!

551
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,180
It seems like it?

552
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:54,880
Oh wow!

553
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,880
We're back.

554
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,180
Wow.

555
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,060
Okay.

556
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,340
Thermos.

557
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,560
Is this a fire...

558
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,980
Firewatch place?

559
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,300
Thermos.

560
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,220
Getting your place all dirty.

561
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:19,820
Nasty.

562
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,040
Doesn't look very lived in at all.

563
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,700
Oh, this is Jane.

564
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,460
Bulligan Thornton come in!

565
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:26,780
Over!

566
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,940
Uh, Thornton here?

567
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,620
Uh, Gates.

568
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,740
We got both Wheeler and Rose in custody.

569
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:33,720
Rose!

570
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,800
Why did they

571
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,910
arrest Rose?

572
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,490
We got Wheeler and Rose here.

573
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,230
Is his name Barry Wheeler?

574
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:52,350
Boy.

575
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:55,950
Ooh.

576
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:56,810
Ooh.

577
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:57,950
Bamboo, thank you so much.

578
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:58,390
Welcome back.

579
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,370
Uh, I don't have anything on that day.

580
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,230
Thank you so much!

581
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,150
Okay.

582
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,790
Anyway, Rose.

583
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,810
Rose is just being plain weird here.

584
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,730
You better get docked in to take a look at both of us.

585
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:10,650
Oh.

586
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:11,330
Gotcha.

587
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,150
You better get them here quickly.

588
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,150
The Fed's gonna want to interview the wheeler over.

589
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:16,790
Oh, geez.

590
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,530
Oh, yeah, I bet.

591
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,280
Oh, look at that.

592
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,240
They're holding my people.

593
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,280
Well, not so much Rose, but, you know.

594
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:30,740
Let's see.

595
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,780
What do we have over here?

596
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,420
What do we...

597
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,740
Oh.

598
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,680
Radio tower.

599
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,360
And what's this?

600
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:50,840
the radio station in the distance yeah i guess that's where
we're headed barry we gotta save that guy oh you're fine

601
00:40:50,840 --> 00:41:03,920
you're fine everything's cool we're chill is there anything
else over here okay here we go through here what's this away

602
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,500
i imagine that the broadcast tower in the distance was part
of the local radio station.

603
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,480
Main seemed like a decent guy.

604
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,740
Perhaps he could give me directions to the coal mine.

605
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:14,860
Oh, okay.

606
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,620
I thought that this way was a way.

607
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,680
But it doesn't seem like it.

608
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,880
What's that light down there?

609
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,940
If I drop, do I die?

610
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,020
Oh, you won't let me.

611
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,460
Yes?

612
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,640
You guys were all wrong.

613
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,900
They wouldn't even let me drop.

614
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,500
I would have been done with this.

615
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,160
Oh,

616
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:40,820
the crows.

617
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:43,860
Oh!

618
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,320
Unnatural shadows clung to the gate.

619
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,360
The darkness that was after me was trying to stop me.

620
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,200
I wouldn't get through without a light.

621
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,980
Destroy the gate.

622
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,040
Look at it.

623
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,480
It's shivering.

624
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,560
So cold.

625
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,020
Why are you moving like that?

626
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,860
Little jerky.

627
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,740
all right let's go find the light i suppose the fire watch
wouldn't they will most definitely have a flash flash flash

628
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:21,480
light sorry no right

629
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:46,340
you would think so i'm gonna double check one more time can
i borrow this lamp anything in the stove Nothing.

630
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,520
A whole lot of nothing.

631
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:51,840
All right, hold on.

632
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,460
Can you see it from here?

633
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,880
It'd be so funny.

634
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,080
No.

635
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,280
Oh, yes you can!

636
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,360
We see you shaking behind the tree.

637
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,410
Um...

638
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:21,890
Man, I think we need maybe fire.

639
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:22,810
Fire.

640
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:24,090
Maybe.

641
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:26,630
Hi, hi Minto!

642
00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:27,270
Hello!

643
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,670
Hello, Brandon!

644
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:31,650
Hoi hoi.

645
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,990
Oh, can we jump here?

646
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:34,950
Oh!

647
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:40,430
Oh no!

648
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,290
We're still escaping the police!

649
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:43,510
Wait, do I have to do this again?

650
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,710
I thought we hit a checkpoint before, my bad.

651
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,630
Listen to this again?

652
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:50,830
Yeah, sorry, my bad guys.

653
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:53,970
My curiosity.

654
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:05,310
Okay, we're gonna do multiple...

655
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:05,530
Alright.

656
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:07,490
Whoa, what the heck just happened?

657
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,270
Wait, one second?

658
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,270
Sorry.

659
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:12,770
Uh...

660
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,350
What just happened?

661
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,670
Oh, what is this?

662
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:20,890
What the heck is this?

663
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:21,150
Wait.

664
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,110
Oh, sorry.

665
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,670
Something like some weird pop-up showed up on my computer.

666
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:29,030
Weird!

667
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:30,410
Okay, we're good.

668
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:40,350
I could see the lights at the radio station in the distance.

669
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:42,230
Yeah.

670
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:47,970
Darkness virus.

671
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:50,670
It actually, like, yeah, it's kind of weird.

672
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:59,950
I think it might be the interface for, what's it called, the
Epic Store or whatever the heck?

673
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:01,290
Glitching a little.

674
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,450
I imagine that the broadcast tower in the distance was part
of the local radio station.

675
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:14,850
station main seemed like a decent guy perhaps he could give
me directions to the coal mine okay and then the freaky wind

676
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:38,000
a natural shadow is clung to the gate the darkness that was
oh my gosh that hurt bad okay sorry geez oh everything up

677
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:53,970
here that bit me literally bit me is this it doesn't seem
like it can even I was gonna say does it need to be powered

678
00:45:53,970 --> 00:46:04,050
but it doesn't look like it can be let's see what we got
over here we got this bad boy with a blinking light we got a

679
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:09,910
sick ramp whoa and we got there was no power to the search
light Oh.

680
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,790
Really?

681
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:13,170
Not?

682
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,090
It is this thing?

683
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,310
This thing looks a million years old.

684
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:23,550
You've got the right idea.

685
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:26,690
Oh, I see a button there.

686
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,270
Oh.

687
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:32,510
A sick ram.

688
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:38,490
I don't think this thing should be working.

689
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:39,550
Oh my god.

690
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:41,090
The sparks coming out of it.

691
00:46:41,110 --> 00:46:52,250
it this is this this seems scary this seems like the
equivalent of oh ellie the old generator conked out i'd have

692
00:46:52,250 --> 00:47:00,090
to see if i could fix it and try again oh my god really but
this seems like the equivalent of like putting a blow dryer

693
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,690
a hair dryer in uh in a bathtub

694
00:47:09,250 --> 00:47:10,370
You awake?

695
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,110
I'm working on it.

696
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:15,750
Alright, let's do this again.

697
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,170
Oh!

698
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:19,130
Just kidding.

699
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,930
I don't need to do... Wait, it just dissolved.

700
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,630
The whole thing dissolved.

701
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,130
Can I turn it back on?

702
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:30,990
No!

703
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:32,310
Okay.

704
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:35,630
Gate defeated.

705
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:43,750
The real boss of Alan Wake.

706
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,230
Gates and boundaries.

707
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:50,150
Alright, checkpoint reached.

708
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:50,730
Let's go.

709
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:52,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

710
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:01,460
Just gotta go towards the light.

711
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,380
La, la, la, towards the light.

712
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,920
The one time I'll...

713
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,160
Oh my god, another gate.

714
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,540
The one time I should be going towards the...

715
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,520
Wait, what's that?

716
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,080
Oh, shoot.

717
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:19,640
Uh-oh.

718
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,520
Wait, we don't have baddies, do we?

719
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,420
Because I still don't have a gun.

720
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,040
But I have a flashlight.

721
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,500
Which is great.

722
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,280
And five batteries.

723
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:36,500
Nice.

724
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,340
And...

725
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:39,500
Yeah.

726
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,160
Those darn gates.

727
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,780
One bad thing.

728
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,540
I know I choose to play like the games once a week.

729
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,280
Because part of me...

730
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,480
What is happening here?

731
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,360
Part of me likes to have it kind of seem like a weekly
episodic episode for these types of games.

732
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,220
But then the...

733
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:05,540
It took me a moment to recognize the flashbang grenades.

734
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,060
They were an ideal weapon for my situation.

735
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:08,620
Nice.

736
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,060
The terrible thing is I forget how to play.

737
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,560
You show those gates for a minute.

738
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,040
Yeah.

739
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,200
I will.

740
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:19,820
Flashbang!

741
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,320
Flashbang!

742
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,880
Flashbang!

743
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,080
Flashbang!

744
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:25,460
Flashbang!

745
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,780
Flashbang!

746
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,260
Nice.

747
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,280
You trying to talk to me?

748
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,140
Holy cow.

749
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,480
I could never play games just once a week like this.

750
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,580
It's difficult for me too.

751
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,280
I do it for like a couple reasons.

752
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,280
One is because, you know, if someone...

753
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:56,160
can't catch the vod i like to give them the opportunity to
to watch it like it gives you a week to catch up if you're

754
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:03,000
like for especially for episodic story or like you know uh
not episodic but well i guess not really well you know like

755
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,940
story heavy story heavy games like this

756
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:15,900
i totally get it but there's always trade-offs exactly
exactly so

757
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:35,580
so our way to throw the flash oh my god no oh shoot wait
wait but i don't have a gun for you oh shoot i don't have a

758
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:44,060
thing to kill you with oh my god come here okay oh shoot

759
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,780
oh man i don't have a gun i have to rely on bombs?

760
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,280
This sucks.

761
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:57,100
This sucks, this sucks, this sucks, this sucks.

762
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,320
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

763
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:58,700
Fine.

764
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,100
Ah!

765
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,800
Oh my god.

766
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:05,200
Oh,

767
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:10,930
no, I'm gonna run out.

768
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,490
I need to go that away.

769
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:20,570
This away.

770
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,810
Yeah, shut up.

771
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:30,470
Oh, more flashbacks, more flashbacks.

772
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,470
More flashbacks.

773
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:34,530
Hello?

774
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,410
And here's another call.

775
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:39,530
You're on KBFFM with...

776
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:40,390
KBFFM?

777
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,570
It's Milp Peabody, Pat.

778
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,610
What's on your mind, Milp?

779
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:49,930
Well, I live near the trailer park, Pat, and there's a big
ruckus going on over there.

780
00:51:50,670 --> 00:51:52,750
Well, that's just up the road for me, too.

781
00:51:53,590 --> 00:52:02,930
you know I don't know but there's a bunch of police cars
there lots of sirens helicopters for one man mind you

782
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:13,910
they're doing all this for one guy a pistol because it's
just next door and they're popping off guns there they're

783
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:20,500
still shooting no it was maybe 10 15 minutes ago uh-oh
sounds serious Pat I'm

784
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:25,590
I'm certainly going to give the station a call, Milt.

785
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:26,650
Okay.

786
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,510
You'll hear it here.

787
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:29,510
Who's sure does that?

788
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:31,670
Okay, thanks.

789
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,410
Yeah, give the station a call.

790
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,450
The music is so funny.

791
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,890
He's like, there's a lot of stuff going on.

792
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:44,750
What's up here?

793
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:46,110
Anything?

794
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:47,850
It looks like a pathway, though.

795
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,330
Am I crazy?

796
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,290
Gosh, this game...

797
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,270
This game feels way too open world.

798
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,490
Alright, I got six.

799
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:02,850
Alright, let's go.

800
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:06,410
Oh, manuscript.

801
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:15,370
Another guy.

802
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,670
Oh my god, wait, a bunch of guys.

803
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,290
Holy cow.

804
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:19,670
Come here.

805
00:53:20,550 --> 00:53:21,070
Oh!

806
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:22,990
Oh, shoot.

807
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:23,570
Oh, shoot.

808
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,190
Oh my god.

809
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:27,790
Kill him!

810
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:28,270
Yeah.

811
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,810
Oh, that was close.

812
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:32,110
That was close.

813
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:33,490
Get back to the light.

814
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,170
Wait, is the light out?

815
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:36,650
Oh, the light.

816
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:38,250
No, the light is out.

817
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,010
Why?

818
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,850
But we only use two.

819
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:47,910
Which seems to be the ideal.

820
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:51,510
Oh, let's check it out.

821
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:56,190
Pat is playing killer frequency while you are running
around.

822
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:05,290
in the woods it's true if you don't know what the game
killer frequency is it's a game that's like takes place all

823
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:13,150
in a radio station about like a real killer on the loose
everything was drawn in black and gray crayons the old lady

824
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:19,510
had promised her that all her wishes would come true she
would be alan wake's muse oh she was smiling so hard it hurt

825
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:26,950
her face she crushed a bottle full of sleeping pills into
the coffee deep down inside she was screaming in terror.

826
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:27,530
Oh, no.

827
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:30,670
No, Rose!

828
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,510
Who would win in a fight, Casper?

829
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:40,010
Are you?

830
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,490
Always mean.

831
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,270
Doesn't matter who I'm up against.

832
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:44,990
Always mean, though.

833
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:46,350
Always bet on mean, though.

834
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:58,610
I guess I forget that in these fights I can also use my
flashlight to, like, You know, stun them.

835
00:54:58,990 --> 00:54:59,430
Oh shoot!

836
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:00,450
Oh shoot!

837
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,410
Oh!

838
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,400
I only have three left though.

839
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,380
Not good.

840
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,620
What's this away?

841
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,240
Oh, my bad.

842
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:22,040
It's not vitamin spray.

843
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,860
Minit sprays.

844
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:29,680
Secret.

845
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:31,460
What's this?

846
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,120
Oh!

847
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:32,920
Please!

848
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,040
Give me some light!

849
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:38,870
What's this say?

850
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:41,830
Trust no one in the dark.

851
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,270
Where's the light?

852
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:47,850
Let there be a lot.

853
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:48,890
Three flares.

854
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:50,150
Flare gun!

855
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:52,110
Ammo.

856
00:55:52,770 --> 00:55:53,350
Batteries.

857
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,270
Let's go.

858
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:55,910
Yeah, yeah.

859
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:57,530
Light.

860
00:55:58,070 --> 00:55:58,770
What's this say?

861
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,990
Walk in light.

862
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,710
Yeah, I would if I could, you know.

863
00:56:03,830 --> 00:56:06,530
That seems really awesome if that were.

864
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:09,090
If I could do that all the time.

865
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:16,850
The flash bombs, though, have been kind of awesome.

866
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:20,130
Been really appreciating flash banging everybody.

867
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,580
I mean, do you hear this?

868
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,420
Oh, the cops.

869
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,540
Where did I come from?

870
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh, shoot.

871
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,670
I should have gotten them, maybe.

872
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,850
I think?

873
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,530
I think so?

874
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:48,170
To the cops?

875
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,230
Hello?

876
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,030
You went flying.

877
00:56:56,730 --> 00:56:58,470
Oh, flashbang.

878
00:56:59,150 --> 00:56:59,630
Yeah, take them.

879
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:00,190
Take them all.

880
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:00,850
Take them all.

881
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:01,530
Take them all.

882
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:11,780
Scaring me.

883
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,440
Found the cops.

884
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,680
Cops mean ammo.

885
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:24,130
This flashlight is terrible.

886
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,630
Why is it so narrow.

887
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,990
Oh, shoot.

888
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,090
I didn't mean to do that.

889
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:37,750
I didn't mean to do it.

890
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,670
I should have just run, maybe.

891
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,130
Ammo equals enemies.

892
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:49,250
I know, it's the worst trade-off ever.

893
00:57:50,310 --> 00:57:51,090
Wait, the music stopped.

894
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:53,590
Eepie!

895
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,790
Oh.

896
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:54,910
Never mind.

897
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,010
It's still bad.

898
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:03,050
It's got to be more than one, right?

899
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:04,110
Oh.

900
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,870
I wasted it for just one guy.

901
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,610
I got one guide for real?

902
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:11,830
No!

903
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,870
Yeah, check it out.

904
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:18,810
I hope Maine could lend me a car to get to the coal mine.

905
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:22,750
Oh, he's in there!

906
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:25,010
Maine!

907
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:27,710
Let me take your thermos first.

908
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,450
It's a trailer bar.

909
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,550
Whoa, they did my...

910
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,690
They did him so dirty.

911
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:43,730
This is like...

912
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,410
What's his vision like?

913
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,530
Like minus eight?

914
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,730
What is this?

915
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,810
He's cute though.

916
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,030
It's so funny.

917
00:58:58,690 --> 00:58:59,890
Take it.

918
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:05,120
I'm looking around.

919
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,100
Is this a dumpster's full of ammo?

920
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,880
Anything around?

921
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:11,640
What is...

922
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,840
Is this supposed to be electrocuted?

923
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,200
Or electrified?

924
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,280
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

925
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:21,320
That's hardcore for a radio station.

926
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:23,980
Minus 8, minus 20.

927
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,180
Yeah, for real.

928
00:59:30,690 --> 00:59:32,690
I'm trying to see what his license plate is.

929
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:36,710
Does that actually...

930
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,610
It looks like Fujisan.

931
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,730
Is that actually what the Washington plates look like,
though?

932
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:47,130
Keep out wildlife.

933
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:47,890
Oh, you know what?

934
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:48,910
That makes the most sense.

935
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:50,950
More than, like, keeping out...

936
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:53,170
You know, trespassers.

937
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,710
This picture, though.

938
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,850
I think it's supposed to be lighting.

939
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,030
That's what it's supposed to be.

940
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:04,550
Yo, it's so funny looking.

941
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:08,850
Dang.

942
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:17,310
Wait, shh, don't say that.

943
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,170
I'm going to see if I can talk him into an interview.

944
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:20,590
Wait, shh, shh, shh.

945
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,430
Don't tell everybody that I'm here.

946
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:23,110
Come on in, Mr. Wake.

947
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:23,750
Okay.

948
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:27,030
Now police are going to be here in 0.2 seconds.

949
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:31,670
It looks like Mr. Wake is going to need a moment before...

950
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,090
Oh, I'm so glad you could find the time to do this, Mr.
Wake.

951
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:34,870
Oh, there's the cops.

952
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:35,590
I told you.

953
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:38,130

stop it was probably good I hadn't had the chance to tell

959

That's so cool!

964
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:59,250
Wow.

965
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:02,070
Yep.

966
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:06,890
He's FBI's top guy.

967
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:07,770
I believe him.

968
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:08,790
I believe you.

969
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:10,990
Nightingale in the radio station.

970
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:14,070
Nightingale stared through the broken studio window into the
dark woods.

971
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:18,030
He turned around, started to walk out, but Maine grabbed his
arm.

972
01:02:18,790 --> 01:02:25,250
you almost shot me you don't shoot off rounds at people like
that what's the matter with you nightingale shook his arm

973
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:33,870

976
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,530
Oh, I can... Oh, just kidding.

977
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:53,050
Okay.

978
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,190
Interesting.

979
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:57,290
So once I run out of the flashbangs...

980
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,790
Wait, what's that... There's something shining over there.

981
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:06,130
Zenigata is at least halfway competent.

982
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:08,950
Uh-oh.

983
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:10,670
We're back into the Spooky.

984
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:12,910
Everything is terrible.

985
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:16,850
A lot of

986
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:23,910
ammo.

987
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:24,770
That's scary.

988
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:25,550
I don't like that.

989
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:28,890
Stop!

990
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:30,130
Stop!

991
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,350
Okay, we're fine.

992
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:37,490
Revolver!

993
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,590
Oh my god, we have a gun!

994
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,410
We have a gun again!

995
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:46,230
Oh no, we have a gun again.

996
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:51,810
All that for two bozos?

997
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,690
Look, I didn't have a choice.

998
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,370
I thought I saw something shining.

999
01:03:56,370 --> 01:03:57,350
Oh, it was that.

1000
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:58,530
It was my own flashlight.

1001
01:04:00,010 --> 01:04:01,810
Um, was there something over here?

1002
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:02,310
Oh, yes.

1003
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:02,790
Some flares.

1004
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:04,530
Oh, come on!

1005
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:08,290
Oh, wait.

1006
01:04:08,450 --> 01:04:08,850
Oh, shoot.

1007
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:09,130
Ow!

1008
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:10,350
Please!

1009
01:04:10,570 --> 01:04:13,190
Oh, my God, I'm trying to change this.

1010
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:20,590
My bad.

1011
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:24,050
My bad.

1012
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,190
There we go.

1013
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:28,930
Oh, if I...

1014
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:30,310
If I'm going out, you're all good.

1015
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:31,150
going out with me.

1016
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:35,410
I have to remember.

1017
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:37,750
No way.

1018
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:42,540
Yeah.

1019
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,840
Taking you out with me.

1020
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:46,460
Oh, shoot.

1021
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:47,300
Oh, shoot.

1022
01:04:47,540 --> 01:04:48,220
Uh, hold that.

1023
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:53,320
Where's the other guy at?

1024
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,380
No, really.

1025
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,400
Where's the other guy at?

1026
01:04:59,200 --> 01:04:59,820
Oh, my gosh.

1027
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,160
Thank you so much for the 20k so thank you.

1028
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:03,480
Thank you, thank you.

1029
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,000
All right.

1030
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:06,760
Where's the other guy?

1031
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:07,480
There was two of them, no?

1032
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,900
I'm not going to complain.

1033
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:14,560
We keep going.

1034
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,360
We'll save our flashbang for the big boys.

1035
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,380
What is up there, though?

1036
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,520
Oh, oh, shoot.

1037
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:26,140
Oh, there's three of them.

1038
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:26,920
Oh, shoot.

1039
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:33,110
You shall not pass.

1040
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:35,570
Oh, shoot.

1041
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:36,550
Oh!

1042
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,560
Are you trying to...

1043
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,000
Are you trying to get me?

1044
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:45,480
No!

1045
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:47,260
Oh shoot.

1046
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,540
Oh, I did not mean to do that, but that's okay.

1047
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,100
Oh my god, they're tough.

1048
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,720
Tough guys!

1049
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:11,360
Holy...

1050
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:13,480
I'm doing it!

1051
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:14,520
Thank you so much for that, Captain!

1052
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:15,960
What is up here though?

1053
01:06:16,260 --> 01:06:17,180
I'm gonna check it out.

1054
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,860
It's the opposite way of where I need to go, but I'm so
fascinated.

1055
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:25,420
This is definitely...

1056
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:29,440
Look!

1057
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,940
Oh my god, he's coming after me!

1058
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,240
Holy hell!

1059
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:35,100
Whoop!

1060
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:38,300
Juke's like crazy.

1061
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:42,540
Oh shoot.

1062
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,420
Oh, shoot.

1063
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:50,620
Uh, you're dead.

1064
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:51,740
Uh, you're dead.

1065
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,580
You're not dead!

1066
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,100
Oh, you're not dead!

1067
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:54,280
Oh my god!

1068
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:54,860
What the hell?

1069
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:55,680
Oh!

1070
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:56,520
Oh my god!

1071
01:06:56,540 --> 01:06:58,480
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm
running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm ready,

1072
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:07,980
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm
ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,

1073
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:31,540
I made an executive decision.

1074
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:35,100
I changed my mind.

1075
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:38,340
See, there were two of them!

1076
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,320
Where's the other guy though?

1077
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,240
Did he get... got by the light?

1078
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:57,880
Does he like...

1079
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:00,820
Huh.

1080
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,180
Red barrel exploded.

1081
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,240
I don't know.

1082
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:10,580
Whatever.

1083
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,180
We're just gonna keep going.

1084
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,580
Hold on.

1085
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,120
Let's put these on.

1086
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,560
I think Bro got cooked by the lamp.

1087
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,380
That's craziness.

1088
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1089
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,220
Come here.

1090
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,140
Come here!

1091
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:37,740
Woo!

1092
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:38,360
Woo!

1093
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:45,380
Is he down?

1094
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,620
He was down, right?

1095
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:46,960
Oh.

1096
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,400
Maybe not.

1097
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,180
I think I hear someone behind me!

1098
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:53,080
Oh my gosh.

1099
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh my god!

1100
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:01,180
Oh my god!

1101
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:02,940
I thought he was...

1102
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:03,540
Is he still?

1103
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:08,320
Oh my god!

1104
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,880
Oh my god, please!

1105
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,600
Holy cow!

1106
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,880
Okay, let's just... I'm gonna wait for my flashlight to
regenerate.

1107
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:25,340
Then we're gonna keep going, and I'm gonna reload.

1108
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,100
I can't... Oh, I have four bullets left, oh my gosh.

1109
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:29,460
Okay, just kidding.

1110
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:31,960
No!

1111
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:43,110
Stay away from me.

1112
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:43,590
You're free.

1113
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:54,640
There was no sensible reason for the power company work
lights to be here.

1114
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:55,080
Oh, ouch.

1115
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:58,460
It was almost as hard for my life for someone like me to
use.

1116
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:00,200
What'd you say?

1117
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,900
Sorry, I'm fighting for my literal life right now, okay?

1118
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:03,420
Please.

1119
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:06,360
What did you say?

1120
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:11,520
What is this?

1121
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:12,940
What is this?

1122
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,380
Oh, the revolver.

1123
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:15,260
Oh, let's go.

1124
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:18,980
No, please!

1125
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:20,580
No, please!

1126
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,780
Don't do that!

1127
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:22,980
No, please!

1128
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:28,260
He's wondering why the power company is leaving out
flashbangs.

1129
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:28,820
Oh!

1130
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,480
Yeah, good question.

1131
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:41,330
Six shots.

1132
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:49,380
And then it helps me go to the next location.

1133
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,200
Checkpoint.

1134
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,360
Now they're facing each other.

1135
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,520
It's dark cross lovers.

1136
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,340
That's this way.

1137
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:03,060
Don't fall.

1138
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,580
They're pretty good.

1139
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,040
Thank you!

1140
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:11,420
Okay, they're going out.

1141
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:13,100
What's in here though?

1142
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,520
Oh, big gun!

1143
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:16,660
Shotgun.

1144
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:19,320
Oh!

1145
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:43,490

Does that heal me?

1148
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:01,920
Make me heal faster?

1149
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,020
How did I live?

1150
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:04,660
I don't know.

1151
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,220
I'm sweating so much.

1152
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:07,680
This game makes me sweat so much.

1153
01:12:14,990 --> 01:12:17,250
Turned them on when the guys are around.

1154
01:12:17,350 --> 01:12:19,750
Yeah, but I like got ambushed inside a building.

1155
01:12:19,910 --> 01:12:21,330
It was kind of difficult to leave.

1156
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:22,430
Wait, what's this say?

1157
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,230
The darkness controls the taken.

1158
01:12:25,950 --> 01:12:26,630
Thank you.

1159
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:50,200

01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,020
Up on the roof?

1163
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,230
How do you even?

1164
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,400
Oh, I see!

1165
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,520
Wait, how do you get up there?

1166
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:36,120
But what is up there?

1167
01:13:38,240 --> 01:13:39,260
What is up?

1168
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,580
Oh, come on, Alan.

1169
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,180
I need you to work with me here.

1170
01:13:43,260 --> 01:13:45,640
I need you to apply yourself a little bit, please.

1171
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:47,400
Oh, don't do that.

1172
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:47,640
Okay.

1173
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:48,400
Alright.

1174
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,680
Oh, no, no, don't slide.

1175
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,560
Oh, my gosh.

1176
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:52,440
Alright, Alan.

1177
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:53,780
Alan, balance.

1178
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:55,340
Yeah.

1179
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,060
Is there anything even up here?

1180
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:05,980
No riding.

1181
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:08,380
Okay.

1182
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:09,820
Nice.

1183
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,360
Nice and easy.

1184
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:12,740
Yeah.

1185
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,460
Okay, I'm up here.

1186
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:16,800
What now?

1187
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:20,980
Oh, yeah.

1188
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:22,780
We made it!

1189
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:26,540
Alan.

1190
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:33,020
Oh.

1191
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:36,900
Now what?

1192
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,840
We get a nice view of the...

1193
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
of the area?

1194
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:45,100
What?

1195
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:49,600
I guess it's just for, like, storytelling to show why
there's a hole in the roof.

1196
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:52,840
But I feel like there should really be...

1197
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:54,820
A reason to come up here.

1198
01:14:56,680 --> 01:15:08,800
how mysterious for scouting maybe maybe all right hold on I
got my how many flashbittings do I have now none cool all

1199
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,500
right love that for us

1200
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:19,020
at least this way seems light seems bright

1201
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:33,430
thermos and nothing else This area seems like it has a nice
bright light going on.

1202
01:15:34,350 --> 01:15:35,510
Just gonna keep heading there.

1203
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:39,650
This is the only game seriously where I'm like, head towards
the light.

1204
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:43,410
I'm gonna take a little breeding break.

1205
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:46,430
Alan Yoink.

1206
01:15:46,690 --> 01:15:48,370
Sarah distrust Nightingale.

1207
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:52,810
Sarah trusted her gut, and her gut said Agent Nightingale
was an asshole.

1208
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:56,970
He felt wrong, and it wasn't just the smell of stale booze.

1209
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:04,750
it was in the way he flashed his badge pulled rank the look
in his eyes when he wanted answers where was alan wake what

1210
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:11,470
was this about an accident where was his wife and most
importantly why did she let wake go he wouldn't answer her

1211
01:16:11,470 --> 01:16:13,920
questions federal business was all he'd say

1212
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:22,970
time to nerd it up with text

1213
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:33,540
Oh, yeah.

1214
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,250
Oh, yeah, let's go.

1215
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:36,640
All right.

1216
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:42,500
So, we're just going to follow the tracks.

1217
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,700
Doesn't seem very wise.

1218
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,280
I guess it's all we got, huh?

1219
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:49,400
The train!

1220
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:50,780
Hello?

1221
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,420
Hello?

1222
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:55,780
The most stubborn man I've ever met.

1223
01:16:56,460 --> 01:16:56,760
Alice?

1224
01:16:57,140 --> 01:16:57,480
Alice?

1225
01:16:58,340 --> 01:16:59,000
Alan,

1226
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:14,120
eyes?

1227
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:14,800
Hello?

1228
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:16,600
Alice!

1229
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:18,260
Alice, I'm here!

1230
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:19,480
Go

1231
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:23,580
to hell.

1232
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:26,040
You need to be careful to cooperate.

1233
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,060
This is the...

1234
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,100
The connection had been terrible, but that wasn't the only
thing that hadn't been right with the call.

1235
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,880
She sounded wrong somehow.

1236
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:37,440
But she had called me.

1237
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,940
That was a modern day ransom message.

1238
01:17:40,180 --> 01:17:41,200
That was somebody...

1239
01:17:42,740 --> 01:17:43,660
That was...

1240
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:47,700
You know how like people will cut up the newspapers and make
a thing like that?

1241
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,980
That was literally...

1242
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,100
That was just that.

1243
01:17:56,180 --> 01:17:58,340
Oh, okay.

1244
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,660
I thought there was much more happening, but there wasn't.

1245
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,780
Yeah, definitely AI generated.

1246
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:10,080
Wake attacked by a possessed object?

1247
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:13,620
The pipe wrenched itself loose from the bridge's steel
framework.

1248
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:17,340
Wrapped in darkness, it floated in midair, twitching.

1249
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:18,020
I'm sorry?

1250
01:18:18,380 --> 01:18:20,840
For a moment, I didn't understand what I was looking at.

1251
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:21,260
Oh, boy.

1252
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,980
The heavy object lurched at me with impossible force.

1253
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:33,180
out of the way but just barely when i turned my flashlight
on it it shook in a dark rage before it flew at me again oh

1254
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:42,400

some sort on the opposite shore yep i hoped i could find a

1256

car from there yep all right let's not get attacked by a
pipe now okay Alan pipe Alan plump or we're taking up a new

1257
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,520

1258
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:30,000
uh-huh is it one of those down there oh my goodness if so
wild stuff oh why is that moving is it you You.

1259
01:19:31,020 --> 01:19:31,940
Is it you?

1260
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:38,260
That was, that's not steel though down there.

1261
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,580
That looks like concrete, right?

1262
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,560
Oh, oh, oh my god.

1263
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:43,780
Oh my god.

1264
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:45,280
All right, this is steel.

1265
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:50,540
Just a barrel.

1266
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:53,380
Right.

1267
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:56,500
The darkness that was pursuing me was growing strong.

1268
01:19:56,580 --> 01:19:57,260
Oh my god.

1269
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:59,540
I was taking over everything in its path.

1270
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,280
Oh, no, not the wood!

1271
01:20:05,940 --> 01:20:07,520
Oh, my gosh.

1272
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,960
This is really getting crazy, isn't it?

1273
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:14,500
What's happening?

1274
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:15,540
Oh, my God.

1275
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,120
Here it comes.

1276
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:17,760
Oh, there it is.

1277
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:19,440
Woo!

1278
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:20,300
Woo!

1279
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,020
Woo!

1280
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:24,040
Oh!

1281
01:20:28,030 --> 01:20:28,650
Oh, my God.

1282
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:30,450
You.

1283
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:32,930
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

1284
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:33,730
Holy...

1285
01:20:33,730 --> 01:20:34,090
Oh, my God.

1286
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:35,010
We're about to die, for real.

1287
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:36,610
Oh, my God!

1288
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:37,850
Okay.

1289
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:41,470
We didn't get a loading.

1290
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:42,290
No!

1291
01:20:42,790 --> 01:20:44,670
I hoped I could find a car from there.

1292
01:20:46,290 --> 01:20:47,290
Oh, my God.

1293
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:48,850
Okay.

1294
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,590
Holy shit.

1295
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:54,490
Good thing I have 17 batteries, but...

1296
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:54,770
Oh, whoops.

1297
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,630
It's flat.

1298
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,790
Who's breathing here?

1299
01:21:01,470 --> 01:21:02,510
What does it say?

1300
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:03,990
Follow?

1301
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,670
follow

1302
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,920
follow which way

1303
01:21:18,980 --> 01:21:28,340
do you think flares work here too oh true true have we just
it's not the um it's not like a shooting it's like you just

1304
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:31,740
kind of get rid of it you banish the darkness until

1305
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:43,400
until um it disappears

1306
01:21:46,620 --> 01:21:49,220
I do not have any flashbangs, unfortunately.

1307
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:59,200
I can't tell what this is asking me to do.

1308
01:22:00,380 --> 01:22:00,920
Follow.

1309
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,780
I mean, this is just part of the game, though.

1310
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:06,700
Like, this is where I'm supposed to go.

1311
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:08,760
Huh.

1312
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:12,720
Fill their dark souls with a line.

1313
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,340
This is weird.

1314
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,580
Maybe something further down the bridge.

1315
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:19,100
Maybe.

1316
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:21,560
Mysterious.

1317
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:27,260
I like how this is scripted to move.

1318
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,960
So strange.

1319
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,660
I don't know, sorry.

1320
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:37,240
You have no reason to apologize.

1321
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,400
Just...

1322
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:43,380
The darkness that was pursuing me was growing strong.

1323
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:46,760
and it was taking over Yeah, I'll try using...

1324
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:47,280
Oh, no!

1325
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,080
The void is followed on me!

1326
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,280
Okay, this is like craziness here.

1327
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:55,100
This is like really craziness here.

1328
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,360
Stop aiming at that!

1329
01:23:14,720 --> 01:23:15,140
Yeah!

1330
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:17,320
Oh, that worked really well.

1331
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,260
Oh my gosh!

1332
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:20,580
Out!

1333
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,060
Oh, shoot.

1334
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:32,340
I didn't mean to do that, but that's okay.

1335
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:34,020
Oh.

1336
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:39,920
Anything else?

1337
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:41,840
That one.

1338
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:42,740
Oh my god.

1339
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,320
Oh my god.

1340
01:23:45,660 --> 01:23:46,640
No, no, no.

1341
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,860
We got him.

1342
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:50,720
Okay.

1343
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:54,120
Sheesh!

1344
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,280
Oh my gosh.

1345
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:02,600
Let's see if there's anything over here with a yellow paint.

1346
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:04,640
Nothing.

1347
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:06,200
Nothing.

1348
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,940
So interesting.

1349
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:11,980
Why was that supposed to be a secret?

1350
01:24:16,820 --> 01:24:18,920
I'm gonna switch back to...

1351
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,860
Oh my god, no way.

1352
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:23,780
Again?

1353
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:28,700
Is self-quit?

1354
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:34,740
Is self-quit?

1355
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:43,080
It's so funny.

1356
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:48,460
We'd love to see it.

1357
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:53,140
I wonder if there's like something over here.

1358
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,960
Maybe I'm just psyching myself out trying to find this dang
secret.

1359
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:01,460
Okay, whatever.

1360
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:03,300
Why am I doing nothing?

1361
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:07,580
Easiest fight of my life.

1362
01:25:14,780 --> 01:25:17,780
I thought I heard something coming alive here.

1363
01:25:18,900 --> 01:25:20,120
What do we got going on?

1364
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,700
What are we writing about?

1365
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:25,200
Wake in the dark presence in the lodge.

1366
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,720
I slammed the door shut right in his smug face.

1367
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:29,960
He pleaded for me to open the door.

1368
01:25:30,540 --> 01:25:33,000
True to form, the asshole actually thought I would obey.

1369
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:33,320
Oh.

1370
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:34,760
I had no sympathy left.

1371
01:25:35,060 --> 01:25:35,820
No guilt either.

1372
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,720
Not for him.

1373
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:38,920
I took a moment to savor the scream.

1374
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:39,560
Oh, dang!

1375
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:41,500
I bet I had a smile on my face.

1376
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:43,460
It was all that I had time for.

1377
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:46,060
The dark presence was inside the lodge with me.

1378
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,900
Ooh, uh-uh.

1379
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,920
So I'm guessing that's about Mr. Nightingale.

1380
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,060
Rip erroneous.

1381
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:00,680
As a teenager, just started to get interested in writing.

1382
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:03,560
Stephen King had been a source of inspiration to me.

1383
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,160
No kidding.

1384
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,620
I thought about all the inanimate objects that had come to
life in his books.

1385
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,240
No one is safe in a good horror story.

1386
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,000
Certainly not the protagonist.

1387
01:26:12,620 --> 01:26:13,580
That's what makes them fun.

1388
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:24,900
this was anything but the darkness could possess anything
and it was getting closer heavy-duty flashlight oh hold down

1389
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:31,280
does this run out faster revolver batteries

1390
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:38,640
see if there's anything else around

1391
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:50,640
oh the bots is usually saved he does have a point, though,
yeah.

1392
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,080
Oh, what's going on in here?

1393
01:26:55,940 --> 01:26:59,400
It doesn't seem like our flashlight changed, literally, at
all, but whatever.

1394
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,400
Again, we do need to go out through here.

1395
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,540
It'll close the circles faster.

1396
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,500
Okay, that's all I needed to do, baby.

1397
01:27:11,240 --> 01:27:11,620
Thermos?

1398
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,400
What is this?

1399
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:15,540
What are these sounds?

1400
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,920
I said I wasn't going to be obsessed with picking these up.

1401
01:27:21,940 --> 01:27:22,820
but I kind of am.

1402
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:24,200
Wait, this place is in operation.

1403
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:38,320
Thank you very much.

1404
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:40,260
What's this?

1405
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:40,740
A flare?

1406
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:42,520
A singular flare?

1407
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,060
I mean, I'll take it.

1408
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,860
I will take it.

1409
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,680
Look at... I'm noticing a bunch of red barrels, too.

1410
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,940
So I'm like, what kind of fight is going to be happening
here?

1411
01:27:54,660 --> 01:27:57,240
This game is oddly generous, you think?

1412
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,340
Well, I don't disagree, for sure.

1413
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:01,260
But at the same time, I'm like...

1414
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,280
It's a lot of combat.

1415
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:09,780
Train fight.

1416
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,200
Oh my god, the darkness is gold.

1417
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,520
We'll possess the train.

1418
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:14,420
Ah, here they are.

1419
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:19,100
He's just... He's just standing here.

1420
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:25,590
Holy shit!

1421
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:26,670
Oh my god!

1422
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:31,030
Yeah, you're gonna come here!

1423
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:39,780
Oh,

1424
01:28:43,620 --> 01:28:43,980
I'm down.

1425
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,280
Dang it.

1426
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:47,020
Certainly not the protagonist.

1427
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,620
That's what makes them fun.

1428
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:50,520
This was anything but...

1429
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:50,940
Shut up.

1430
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:54,100
The darkness could possess anything, and it was getting
closer.

1431
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:55,360
Uh, heavy duty.

1432
01:28:55,620 --> 01:28:55,760
Okay.

1433
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:58,100
All right.

1434
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:00,180
Yikes.

1435
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,300
Okay.

1436
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,100
Uh, was there anything else?

1437
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:09,350
Okay, we got this.

1438
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:10,190
Hmm.

1439
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,110
I wish there was a checkpoint, like, right there.

1440
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:16,470
Alan, yep.

1441
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:20,090
Um.

1442
01:29:22,570 --> 01:29:26,030
Now, hitting that guy, did this right there.

1443
01:29:27,210 --> 01:29:31,170
Did do a good bit, so we'll keep that for sure.

1444
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:34,230
I gotta get another one, though.

1445
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:38,070
Like, maybe that one right there for the big guy or
something.

1446
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:57,890
I like we just stand here in silence and they start walking
out in silence all right okay so that yeah a big guy needs a

Dang it.

1454
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:04,280
I didn't get to...

1455
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:08,820
I thought I wanted to use this one here, but...

1456
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,940
Oh, well.

1457
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:10,540
It's fine.

1458
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,020
The dodges.

1459
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:16,240
The juke's.

1460
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:17,320
The maneuvers.

1461
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:21,520
I go in there.

1462
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:23,840
Oh, we just got the checkpoint.

1463
01:31:24,180 --> 01:31:24,420
Awesome.

1464
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:34,280
Push it.

1465
01:31:34,980 --> 01:31:35,720
Alan, push.

1466
01:31:40,060 --> 01:31:41,340
Alan's pretty good.

1467
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:43,320
Don't give him that credit.

1468
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:44,200
What the?

1469
01:31:44,860 --> 01:31:45,820
Oh my god!

1470
01:32:11,260 --> 01:32:12,460
Holy cow.

1471
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,200
It was like the softest.

1472
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,920
He pushed over the boxes so softly.

1473
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:18,860
I couldn't tell.

1474
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:22,220
I couldn't tell.

1475
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,540
Like what was...

1476
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,980
I was like, is this supposed to happen?

1477
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:30,440
Everything was so soft.

1478
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:34,140
What's this?

1479
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,700
In light, you can hurt them.

1480
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:37,740
I think...

1481
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:38,300
I know.

1482
01:32:40,820 --> 01:32:42,700
I think I got that.

1483
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:44,080
Thank you.

1484
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:50,130
The most unsurprising knockover.

1485
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,950
It was, like, entirely quiet.

1486
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:54,250
Which is why it was just, like, was happening.

1487
01:32:56,550 --> 01:32:57,630
Do not recycle.

1488
01:32:57,850 --> 01:32:59,890
Why do these people have against recycling?

1489
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,430
Pick up the flares.

1490
01:33:05,910 --> 01:33:06,950
More batteries.

1491
01:33:08,030 --> 01:33:08,750
More everything.

1492
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,310
Is this TV not gonna turn on?

1493
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,870
Oh, wait, do we get to watch the zone?

1494
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:15,290
I'm in the zone.

1495
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:17,290
We'll take the facts of our existence for granted.

1496
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:21,470
Unaware that they're merely a thin veneer of desperate
self-delusion.

1497
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:21,950
Yes.

1498
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:23,230
Night Springs!

1499
01:33:24,150 --> 01:33:25,490
Yeah, we're in the zone.

1500
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:28,210
All too often, the stars are right.

1501
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:29,110
Night Springs!

1502
01:33:30,830 --> 01:33:33,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1503
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:36,370
While this is happening, I'm gonna eat.

1504
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,530
The cough drop.

1505
01:33:40,450 --> 01:33:47,410
The journalist Alvin Dirlis' trip to study the local customs
of an insular community in Night Springs has been less than

1506
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:48,070
successful.

1507
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:50,830
Until tonight.

1508
01:33:53,930 --> 01:33:55,690
Well, I'm glad you changed your minds about this.

1509
01:33:55,970 --> 01:33:57,710
Ancient customs, local mythology.

1510
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:59,450
My editor loves this kind of stuff.

1511
01:34:01,190 --> 01:34:01,670
DERLIS.

1512
01:34:02,030 --> 01:34:02,130
DERLIS.

1513
01:34:02,350 --> 01:34:02,830
DERLIS.

1514
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:05,930
But you have demonstrated the seriousness of your intent.

1515
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:07,210
Oh, I am serious.

1516
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:07,630
Really?

1517
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:08,630
Just do your thing.

1518
01:34:08,730 --> 01:34:10,210
I'll stay out of your way and observe.

1519
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:12,790
Actually, I thought you could assist us.

1520
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,530
I'm afraid we are a man short.

1521
01:34:14,810 --> 01:34:17,610
It would provide you with an intimate perspective.

1522
01:34:18,150 --> 01:34:18,750
Could I really?

1523
01:34:18,910 --> 01:34:20,590
Of course, Mr. DERLIS.

1524
01:34:20,850 --> 01:34:21,330
DERLIS?

1525
01:34:21,390 --> 01:34:23,230
I guess that's the least I...

1526
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:24,410
What would I have to do?

1527
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,310
Oh, here.

1528
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:28,230
Let me show you with a kiss.

1529
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:29,170
I am...

1530
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:30,490
What's going on?

1531
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,830
Oh my god.

1532
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:31,870
Mmm.

1533
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:32,650
Mmm.

1534
01:34:33,870 --> 01:34:34,030
Mmm.

1535
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:35,710
Mmm.

1536
01:34:38,930 --> 01:34:42,030
It's the perfect oblivious show right now.

1537
01:34:43,130 --> 01:34:46,490
You have well pleased Nixie Perka, the dweller in flesh.

1538
01:34:47,190 --> 01:34:50,790
Your body shall host his thousand young and all shall be
glory.

1539
01:34:51,110 --> 01:34:52,270
Oh my gosh.

1540
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:57,170
Shh, darling.

1541
01:34:57,570 --> 01:34:58,290
Be calm.

1542
01:34:58,850 --> 01:34:59,150
Shh.

1543
01:35:00,210 --> 01:35:00,630
Wow.

1544
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:03,770
Alvin Durlitz learned a harsh lesson.

1545
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:08,870
If you go looking for mythology, it may come looking for
you.

1546
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,230
That's quite the lesson.

1547
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,550
And such quests always bear fruit.

1548
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:15,610
In Night Springs.

1549
01:35:16,690 --> 01:35:19,330
Never kiss anybody in Night Springs, apparently.

1550
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:23,730
Not the Thousand Young.

1551
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:26,210
I know, it could be the Thousand Old.

1552
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:27,930
It'd be so bad.

1553
01:35:29,110 --> 01:35:30,870
And then this wasn't on, right?

1554
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:31,630
No, okay.

1555
01:35:35,640 --> 01:35:42,040
Okay, we're following the train track.

1556
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:43,620
Oh, Manage Grampage.

1557
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:47,800
Jokes on you, I've never kissed anyone.

1558
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:51,440
You kissed your dog or your cat.

1559
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:54,300
Those are the best kisses.

1560
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,060
Wake attacked by the dark presence.

1561
01:35:56,280 --> 01:36:00,140
The darkness surged towards me, sucking everything loose
from the ground into it.

1562
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:06,380
steps tugging at my clothes oh my god i saw the flare the
kidnapper had dropped and threw myself towards it just as i

1563
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:13,060
felt my feet lead the ground the darkness embraced me with
the force of a tornado wow somehow i managed to light the

1564
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:20,140
flare yeah the darkness roared and cast me away i fell
toward the dark waters of the lake far below what's going on

1565
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:28,000
when do we get this is all at the lodge right or something

Oh, wow!

1568
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:33,980
A lot!

1569
01:36:34,180 --> 01:36:34,360
Okay.

1570
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:40,840
What if I do this?

1571
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,440
What if I jump here?

1572
01:36:45,260 --> 01:36:45,980
Jump out?

1573
01:36:46,760 --> 01:36:47,340
No, come on.

1574
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:49,120
I can make it.

1575
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,300
I could... I could... Wait.

1576
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:56,420
I'm trying to jump across the...

1577
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,060
the... the... the fence.

1578
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:04,300
Ouch!

1579
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:16,450
Okay, for it's supposedly like really dark outside, it's
quite bright.

1580
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:18,070
I don't know about what you guys...

1581
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,950
Ow, that really hurt.

1582
01:37:23,990 --> 01:37:25,270
Oh, we got the checkpoint, okay.

1583
01:37:26,510 --> 01:37:26,910
Nice.

1584
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:32,530
Good, because I might die here.

1585
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:36,430
It's so... there's so much happening.

1586
01:37:45,660 --> 01:37:46,600
Oh, okay.

1587
01:37:47,480 --> 01:37:48,640
Find a vehicle?

1588
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:49,480
Ah!

1589
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:50,800
Oh my god!

1590
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:54,310
What do you mean find a vehicle?

1591
01:37:54,330 --> 01:37:54,610
Ah!

1592
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:55,490
Oh my god.

1593
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:56,110
I'm kidding.

1594
01:37:56,230 --> 01:37:57,510
Oh, they just ran them over.

1595
01:37:58,110 --> 01:37:58,930
Wait, that's kind of awesome.

1596
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:04,160
Oh!

1597
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,030
Vehicle!

1598
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:10,090
Okay, I dodged that one.

1599
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:11,190
I'm not gonna make this, I don't think.

1600
01:38:11,410 --> 01:38:11,990
That's okay, though.

1601
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:13,170
Oh my gosh.

1602
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:14,790
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

1603
01:38:14,990 --> 01:38:15,690
Oh my gosh.

1604
01:38:16,630 --> 01:38:17,830
Oh my gosh.

1605
01:38:18,430 --> 01:38:20,070
The vehicle found us.

1606
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:23,010
I think we have to run over there and press that button.

1607
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:27,230
And hope and pray that we can get to the car or something.

1608
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:28,390
I think...

1609
01:38:28,410 --> 01:38:30,470
That's what we gotta do.

1610
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:33,630
Okay, here we go.

1611
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:34,490
Any flares?

1612
01:38:34,730 --> 01:38:36,410
I do have two, yes.

1613
01:38:48,700 --> 01:38:51,760
Okay, what sucks is I can't run while I have this.

1614
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:56,380
So, uh...

1615
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:56,740
Use.

1616
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:57,540
Ouch!

1617
01:38:59,440 --> 01:38:59,920
Use!

1618
01:39:01,320 --> 01:39:01,540
Use!

1619
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:02,180
Use!

1620
01:39:02,420 --> 01:39:02,420
Use!

1621
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:05,960
Oh my god.

1622
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:06,860
We're so dead.

1623
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,000
Oh my god.

1624
01:39:08,440 --> 01:39:09,120
Is that not...

1625
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:10,560
Okay, that's not what we're supposed to do then.

1626
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,180
Okay, just kidding.

1627
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:13,100
Oh my god.

1628
01:39:13,340 --> 01:39:13,620
Oh my god.

1629
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:14,460
Who's driving this thing?

1630
01:39:14,680 --> 01:39:15,340
Oh my god.

1631
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:16,180
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1632
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:19,180
I dodged though!

1633
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,560
I dodged that one!

1634
01:39:22,740 --> 01:39:23,660
It's opening!

1635
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:24,420
It is?

1636
01:39:25,540 --> 01:39:27,340
Was it opening very slowly?

1637
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:29,120
I don't know about...

1638
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:30,020
Wait, what just happened?

1639
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,820
Oh, the game is...

1640
01:39:32,820 --> 01:39:33,420
Okay, there we go.

1641
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:35,680
Visual glitch?

1642
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,340
It was opening slowly.

1643
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:50,240
I don't think the darkness has a license.

1644
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:51,420
They are not.

1645
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:56,360
That's not a forklift, but they are definitely not certified
for whatever vehicle that is.

1646
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:58,700
Okay.

1647
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,500
Next time, Zag instead of Zig.

1648
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:04,700
All right.

1649
01:40:06,980 --> 01:40:09,140
This is a Tuffy.

1650
01:40:16,270 --> 01:40:18,230
What else do I have?

1651
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:21,270
Shotgun might be better.

1652
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,750
This one's nutty.

1653
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:26,550
Jump over the fence!

1654
01:40:26,690 --> 01:40:27,410
I tried!

1655
01:40:27,970 --> 01:40:28,710
I tried!

1656
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:30,930
Okay.

1657
01:40:33,750 --> 01:40:34,790
I just need it.

1658
01:40:34,850 --> 01:40:36,530
We just gotta keep trying and keep trying.

1659
01:40:47,170 --> 01:40:49,630
Oh my god, it's coming right at us.

1660
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:57,540
Holy shit.

1661
01:40:58,200 --> 01:40:58,200
Nice.

1662
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:01,000
Uh-oh.

1663
01:41:09,270 --> 01:41:11,970
Wait, I can stop it with, like, my light, though.

1664
01:41:12,630 --> 01:41:13,210
Or something.

1665
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:14,610
Wait, did I get that other guy?

1666
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:15,630
Is he down?

1667
01:41:16,330 --> 01:41:16,770
Oh, shoot.

1668
01:41:16,990 --> 01:41:17,210
He is.

1669
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:17,670
Okay.

1670
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:18,810
All right.

1671
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:20,090
No, he's not.

1672
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:22,630
Okay.

1673
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:33,100
There were some batteries over here.

1674
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:33,780
Oh, my gosh.

1675
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:35,960
Four-point turn.

1676
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:36,600
You got this?

1677
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:38,980
opening.

1678
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:41,520
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1679
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,180
Yes, I did it.

1680
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:45,820
Oh, that wasn't so bad.

1681
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:55,000
Oh, wait, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

1682
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,280
go, go.

1683
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:58,000
That wasn't so bad.

1684
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:04,140
I guess it's not a problem anymore.

1685
01:42:04,280 --> 01:42:06,360
I have never been this collab to see the sunrise.

1686
01:42:06,980 --> 01:42:19,060
I had a couple of hours to to the coal mine we just casually
wait there was so much stuff there i missed it all wait

1687
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:22,120
there was so much stuff the coal mine wasn't far now

1688
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:39,390
oh go to the coal mine today i would meet the kidnapper and
he would give me alice i wouldn't give him any other choice

1689
01:42:39,390 --> 01:42:42,170
a drowning man will clutch at a straw

1690
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:46,450
That is true.

1691
01:42:46,830 --> 01:42:47,870
What if I go this way?

1692
01:42:50,550 --> 01:42:52,230
How far will the game let me run?

1693
01:42:52,690 --> 01:42:52,970
Okay, no.

1694
01:42:53,550 --> 01:42:53,630
Sorry.

1695
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:56,310
A win's a win.

1696
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:57,250
Dang it.

1697
01:42:57,370 --> 01:42:59,310
I feel like I missed so much stuff, though.

1698
01:42:59,470 --> 01:43:00,430
Where are we, anyway?

1699
01:43:04,370 --> 01:43:05,310
Good morning, Minto.

1700
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:07,550
Welcome to Bright Falls.

1701
01:43:09,170 --> 01:43:10,510
Coal Mine Museum.

1702
01:43:10,510 --> 01:43:11,370
I am.

1703
01:43:11,530 --> 01:43:11,650
Yeah.

1704
01:43:13,110 --> 01:43:14,250
Don't sweat it?

1705
01:43:18,130 --> 01:43:21,070
There were like at least two, what's it called?

1706
01:43:22,310 --> 01:43:27,950
Like red boxes of supplies that I missed, but not that I can
use it now anyway.

1707
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:32,410
Don't do it.

1708
01:43:32,830 --> 01:43:34,030
Don't do it, Alan.

1709
01:43:38,660 --> 01:43:40,620
This game is really pretty though.

1710
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:41,780
Wow.

1711
01:43:46,450 --> 01:43:47,350
Do it.

1712
01:43:48,350 --> 01:43:49,830
Drive the car, can we?

1713
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:57,180
Am I taking the slow, scenic way?

1714
01:44:01,300 --> 01:44:01,440
Oh!

1715
01:44:05,300 --> 01:44:07,000
On the road again.

1716
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:13,640
Little by little, without realizing it, I'd come to believe
that the story in the manuscript was coming true.

1717
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:18,120
The current of its narrative had taken me deeper and deeper
into dark waters.

1718
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,580
Alice had been taken from me.

1719
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,300
Barry was probably in jail.

1720
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:23,160
I was a fugitive from the FBI.

1721
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:32,820
over by the dark presence trying to destroy me it all felt
real but it matched a textbook case of insanity I don't

1722
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:42,500
think so I think everybody else is also dealing with what
you're dealing with so this tree looks suspicious no okay

1723
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:51,540
sorry I I just had to get out of my curiosity it's dead yeah
but like look at

1724
01:44:54,720 --> 01:45:05,220
for like maybe if i accidentally miss a manuscript page or
something you know oh there we go on the road again rough

1725
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:15,870
road i can handle it i can't work to get on the road again
see i'm gonna check in here

1726
01:45:22,340 --> 01:45:25,900
actually insanity isn't the thing in medicine It's a legal
term.

1727
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,380
Ooh, you tell him, you tell him.

1728
01:45:28,900 --> 01:45:30,280
Wait, we can change cars?

1729
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:32,300
No stinking way.

1730
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:33,840
That's kind of crazy.

1731
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,120
Carry my, carry my.

1732
01:45:50,100 --> 01:45:51,220
Oh, that's so cute.

1733
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:52,720
You watch him actually get over.

1734
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:54,540
Wait, I just...

1735
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:55,960
I literally was just like, nah.

1736
01:45:56,460 --> 01:45:58,120
I'm done with that car.

1737
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,140
I want this car instead.

1738
01:46:01,060 --> 01:46:02,720
Wait, I just stole another car.

1739
01:46:05,660 --> 01:46:07,940
Whoa, why did I do that?

1740
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:12,400
Can I even drive it anymore?

1741
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:15,940
Like, it seems like it's...

1742
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:17,760
Um, the road is closed.

1743
01:46:18,740 --> 01:46:18,940
Or?

1744
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,080
I make my own roads.

1745
01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:23,060
Yeah.

1746
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:26,300
Alan be driving?

1747
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:29,360
GTA Forest?

1748
01:46:33,240 --> 01:46:34,460
Keep going.

1749
01:46:38,370 --> 01:46:39,690
We're off-roading?

1750
01:46:42,130 --> 01:46:42,610
Oh my god.

1751
01:46:45,440 --> 01:46:45,780
Ouch!

1752
01:46:45,940 --> 01:46:46,860
Oh, we're fine.

1753
01:46:49,660 --> 01:46:51,040
Tis a scratch.

1754
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,800
Tis about to scratch.

1755
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,560
We're okay.

1756
01:46:58,360 --> 01:47:00,080
Oh, what's happening to my interface?

1757
01:47:00,540 --> 01:47:01,320
Did you guys see that?

1758
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:05,480
Um.

1759
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,000
Can I take this car, too?

1760
01:47:21,570 --> 01:47:25,410
Hey, this is Pat Main, and you're listening to KBF FM.

1761
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:32,810
Folks, I want to apologize for kind of abandoning you to
that looping music track last night, but I was detained.

1762
01:47:33,310 --> 01:47:33,750
Detained?

1763
01:47:34,130 --> 01:47:34,430
They took...

1764
01:47:34,430 --> 01:47:41,070
I encountered a big-shot G-Man with an itchy trigger finger
who could use a lesson in manners and a boot in the ass.

1765
01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:41,370
Yeah.

1766
01:47:41,590 --> 01:47:42,750
Not necessarily in that order either.

1767
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:48,110
Now, folks, I know I'm not being very informative here, and
I apologize for that.

1768
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:48,670
G-Man.

1769
01:47:48,690 --> 01:47:50,770
I really should just keep quiet, but...

1770
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:52,970
I'm just so peeved right now.

1771
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:55,730
Because some people just shouldn't be carrying badges.

1772
01:47:55,790 --> 01:47:56,150
Oh!

1773
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:57,590
You tell him.

1774
01:47:57,610 --> 01:47:59,570
I'm just glad that our Sheriff Breaker was there to
straighten things out.

1775
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:03,290
I know, oh my god, poor man would have been shot probably.

1776
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:05,970
I'm sorry if my mouth got you in trouble.

1777
01:48:06,490 --> 01:48:08,770
I'm pretty sure you're not the bad guy here.

1778
01:48:09,010 --> 01:48:10,190
He's talking to us!

1779
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:11,810
I hope you know what you're doing.

1780
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:13,650
He's a Chino, thank you!

1781
01:48:14,550 --> 01:48:16,750
I'll be talking to Dr. Nelson all morning.

1782
01:48:17,230 --> 01:48:18,770
But first, a little music.

1783
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:19,690
A little music.

1784
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:22,710
He doesn't think we're the bad guy.

1785
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:27,070
Even though I've just stolen a card about to steal three.

1786
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:30,950
It doesn't think I'm the bad guy.

1787
01:48:32,150 --> 01:48:32,970
Well, he doesn't know.

1788
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:35,910
My second name is Billy Eilish.

1789
01:48:36,830 --> 01:48:39,050
I'm the bad guy.

1790
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,590
Wait, this is just a little shortcut.

1791
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:51,850
I'm looking for manuscript pages real quick.

1792
01:48:55,310 --> 01:48:56,970
Have a safe flight, Rick.

1793
01:49:00,930 --> 01:49:02,390
I'm borrowing them.

1794
01:49:03,190 --> 01:49:03,950
Yeah, exactly.

1795
01:49:09,530 --> 01:49:10,170
I don't know.

1796
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,250
What do you guys like more?

1797
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,910
Which car?

1798
01:49:14,530 --> 01:49:15,830
Which car do you like more?

1799
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,610
This one?

1800
01:49:17,590 --> 01:49:18,230
Or this one?

1801
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:22,230
I kind of want to make it three for three.

1802
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:26,450
The jeep?

1803
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:27,530
Oh, well.

1804
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:46,920
Are you getting dizzy yet?

1805
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:47,900
I am.

1806
01:49:49,680 --> 01:49:50,720
The jeep is all terrain.

1807
01:49:51,020 --> 01:49:52,140
I agree, honestly.

1808
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:59,640
Claims are not the bad guy, despite stealing three cars,
causing property damage by blowing up gas tanks and fighting

1809
01:49:59,640 --> 01:50:00,240
a bulldozer.

1810
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,620
Self-defense!

1811
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:04,240
I claim it.

1817
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,420

1818
01:51:10,740 --> 01:51:10,740
Really?

1819
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:12,460
When did it blow up?

1820
01:51:20,730 --> 01:51:22,230
Grand Theft Allen.

1821
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:25,570
I hear another radio.

1822
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:30,570
Welcome back to KBF FM.

1823
01:51:30,970 --> 01:51:31,670
KBF FM.

1824
01:51:32,650 --> 01:51:37,650
Now, Doc, you were talking about life and finding that
special someone, that soulmate.

1825
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:39,570
Well, you were talking about that.

1826
01:51:39,990 --> 01:51:47,370
I was saying, I don't what are we talking about to me that's
strange because I always think he was a hopeless romantic in

1827
01:51:47,370 --> 01:51:57,130
the 80s you got me there Pat but I think love's where you
look for it and you need to do a lot of looking sure but the

1828
01:51:57,130 --> 01:52:04,630
idea that there's that one special person out there for you
oh wow means a romantic it's gone forever and you're forever

1829
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:14,430
incomplete I mean isn't that depressing or child-achieving
there's a how do you fish in the sea and apparently a

1830
01:52:14,430 --> 01:52:21,990
fisherman has a fishing analogy for what you're saying isn't
that a little harsh well no what I am saying is that your

1831
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:29,910
potential for finding that connection isn't limited to
what's essentially a chance encounter how is that harsh yeah

1832
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:39,550
well old geezers are talking about they talking about okay
now well I don't disagree with you exactly but I can't

1833
01:52:39,550 --> 01:52:48,490
really fit that together with what I feel what I what I felt
for someone because she was the one she was oh my god I let

1834
01:52:48,490 --> 01:52:55,850
her drift away from me oh my god maybe I didn't put in the
work I don't know but well since then and it's a doctor and

1835
01:52:55,850 --> 01:53:04,510
therapist but since then there hasn't been anyone not like
her and I'm not saying I dwell on her or haven't moved on I

1836
01:53:04,510 --> 01:53:12,370
like my life I'm not living in the past but i do miss the
way she completed me oh you can't argue with the heart pat

1837
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:19,770
uh i'm sorry folks i had kind of a scary experience oh let's
just say it's shaken a few things loose

1838
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:32,400
dang pat you're you'll find your special someone

1839
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:39,370
all right let's steal another car

1840
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:44,770
He's been through it.

1841
01:53:44,850 --> 01:53:46,030
It's our fault.

1842
01:53:46,930 --> 01:53:48,130
I'm so sorry.

1843
01:53:52,300 --> 01:53:54,340
I don't like when I put it in reverse.

1844
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:55,560
It like does this.

1845
01:53:56,300 --> 01:53:58,020
It flips the camera around on me.

1846
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,820
I know how to reverse a car without going into.

1847
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:02,800
Without, you know.

1848
01:54:03,420 --> 01:54:04,640
It being totally.

1849
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:10,180
Where are these places in here?

1850
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:11,320
I can go in here.

1851
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:13,760
Oh my gosh.

1852
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:15,060
me more.

1853
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:17,280
Who hurt you, Pai?

1854
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,680
Oh, wait, right, it was Nightingale.

1855
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:19,620
Yeah.

1856
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:25,400
There's so much to explore!

1857
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:27,480
Wow.

1858
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:30,440
Wait, can we go in, like, this whole town?

1859
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:32,860
This whole mining area?

1860
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:34,980
Oh, this don't seem safe.

1861
01:54:35,560 --> 01:54:36,240
Not one bit.

1862
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:38,500
Is this the museum?

1863
01:54:39,120 --> 01:54:43,340
Oh, this doesn't look like it's an operation, but, um...

1864
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,120
Oh, be careful.

1865
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:49,900
Uh, hello?

1866
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:56,040
I hope my soulmate watches VTubers.

1867
01:54:57,020 --> 01:54:58,060
I think they do.

1868
01:54:58,540 --> 01:55:01,540
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

1869
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:07,260
Let's see, where is this?

1870
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,800
Mott on the ferry.

1871
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:14,300
For Mott, spying on the rider on the ferry had been a
disappointment.

1872
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:17,440
His boss had made Wake Out to be something special.

1873
01:55:19,400 --> 01:55:26,140
impressed he'd gotten a good long look up the wife though
and he liked what he saw mod had fantasized about going wake

1874
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:32,640
into a fight but it hadn't happened still he'd get his
chance to see if the writer had anything in him he'd been

1875
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:48,120
promised as much um is that the kidnapper he's got a name
what look at this place wow okay i'm scared now

1876
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:52,560
Mott.

1877
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:57,520
This isn't open, right?

1878
01:55:57,800 --> 01:55:58,820
Just looks like it should.

1879
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:04,160
I almost want to go in there.

1880
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:06,800
Okay.

1881
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:07,860
We keep driving?

1882
01:56:09,540 --> 01:56:10,420
My poor wife.

1883
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:11,200
She's waiting.

1884
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:12,020
Maybe.

1885
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,720
He was the grumpy creeper on the boat.

1886
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:18,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1887
01:56:18,680 --> 01:56:19,120
I remember him.

1888
01:56:19,160 --> 01:56:20,040
He's the kidnapper, too.

1889
01:56:20,180 --> 01:56:20,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1890
01:56:22,260 --> 01:56:24,100
The alleged kidnapper.

1891
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,700
I guess he really is the kidnapper.

1892
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,180
Oh, watch for the tree.

1893
01:56:34,740 --> 01:56:34,840
Oh.

1894
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:37,880
Drifto!

1895
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:40,720
Visitor parking.

1896
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:45,740
I was early.

1897
01:56:46,140 --> 01:56:49,020
I was supposed to meet the kidnapper at noon in the main
building.

1898
01:56:49,900 --> 01:56:51,080
The coal mine was quiet.

1899
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:52,380
It was a museum now.

1900
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:56,140
This doesn't seem...

1901
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:58,940
seem safe for anybody.

1902
01:56:59,540 --> 01:57:03,700
I was going to say for like civilians, but it don't seem
safe for anyone.

1903
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:09,540
It looks like it's like the sun is already setting.

1904
01:57:11,320 --> 01:57:13,540
If this is noon, what's this say?

1905
01:57:14,380 --> 01:57:16,660
I thought of something, you guys, for next week.

1906
01:57:17,900 --> 01:57:21,840
Because kind of going on like my little, showing the like
dinosaur tangent and everything.

1907
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:31,120
One thing I wanted to do a long time ago was back because of
I haven't looked into if places still do this, but I still

1908
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:33,300
want to do it next week if they still do.

1909
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,720
But that was part of what I was going to do today.

1910
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:44,300
But museums had like virtual museum things that you could
like tour the museum just virtually.

1911
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:48,240
And so I wanted us to go on some virtual museum tours.

1912
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,740
And we'll learn some stuff.

1913
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,720
They still do that!

1914
01:57:56,160 --> 01:57:56,600
Oh yeah!

1915
01:57:57,140 --> 01:57:58,120
Let's do it.

1916
01:57:59,840 --> 01:58:01,680
Well, there were some earlier residents in the area.

1917
01:58:01,860 --> 01:58:07,560
The true genesis of the town of Bright Falls came with the
founding of the Bright Falls Mining Company and the opening

1918
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:10,000
of the Bright Falls Coal Mine in 1878.

1919
01:58:11,380 --> 01:58:16,920
Although the work was hard and dangerous, many immigrants,
Germans, Poles, Italians, Finns and Swedes, among others,

1920
01:58:17,020 --> 01:58:18,040
worked in the mines.

1921
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:20,320
What did I say?

1922
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,320
Oh, just the mine museum.

1923
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:24,360
I see you.

1924
01:58:32,520 --> 01:58:33,680
Dinosaur tour, maybe.

1925
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:35,760
I was going to find some cool places.

1926
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:39,900
While lucrative at first, the mining steadily declined in
the 20th century.

1927
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:42,060
The seams were rich, but hard to get at.

1928
01:58:42,380 --> 01:58:46,500
And the volcanic activity in the area made the mine shafts
particularly dangerous.

1929
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:48,140
Oh, the sun's coming out.

1930
01:58:49,580 --> 01:58:50,060
Tomorrow.

1931
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:52,640
I've reached the checkpoint.

1932
01:58:52,820 --> 01:58:53,380
But you're mine.

1933
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:53,820
I'm done.

1934
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:54,480
Oh, da, da.

1935
01:58:54,780 --> 01:58:55,260
Tomorrow.

1936
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:57,820
There we are.

1937
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,880
Now I'm just looking at the museum part.

1938
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:06,840
Wait, what's this say?

1939
01:59:06,980 --> 01:59:07,380
I'm reading.

1940
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:13,800
In 1970, a volcanic eruption below Cauldron Lake, while
relatively minor, caused most of the deep mining tunnels to

1941
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:15,180
collapse or flood.

1942
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:18,660
32 miners lost their lives in the calamity.

1943
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:21,980
And all mining around Bright Falls came to a final stop.

1944
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:26,120
Now, many of the remaining buildings are protected as
historical landmarks.

1945
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:27,500
Oh!

1946
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:29,260
I almost missed that.

1947
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:30,460
Okay.

1948
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:34,800
Sarah in the radio station.

1949
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:40,400
With Nightingale gone and the night wind blowing in through
the broken studio window, Maine stared at Sarah.

1950
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:42,180
The sheriff looked away.

1951
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:45,080
Maine's voice shook with barely controlled anger.

1952
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:45,600
Ooh.

1953
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:47,880
That boy's doing more drinking than thinking.

1954
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,060
And how many adults?

1955
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:49,920
I hope you know what you're doing, Sarah.

1956
01:59:50,380 --> 01:59:51,680
He's got a sickness in his eyes.

1957
01:59:52,140 --> 01:59:53,180
You take my word for it.

1958
01:59:53,460 --> 01:59:56,260
He wants wake for a reason, and it's not for anything good.

1959
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:58,460
Yeah, do we even know why this guy is here?

1960
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:02,720
Mint reading all the local history learned nothing major.

1961
02:00:06,820 --> 02:00:12,220

1962
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:31,560

building i guess i didn't want to go outside cops had to be

1963
02:00:31,560 --> 02:00:32,400
looking for me

1964
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:43,900
turned the place into a sauna the day dragged on different
scenarios ran through my mind ways of how i'd torture the

1965
02:00:43,900 --> 02:00:50,020
kidnapper to get alice back or the different horrible things
he could have done to her i imagined her dead no i had no

1966
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:57,260
way of knowing she was still alive it was killing me uh

1967
02:00:57,260 --> 02:01:06,940
it's like nighttime now oh my god it was all a waste of time
the bastard never showed up Maybe he's dead.

1968
02:01:08,440 --> 02:01:10,120
We waited all day!

1969
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,020
Alan wait, then Alan rage.

1970
02:01:15,940 --> 02:01:16,380
Wake.

1971
02:01:16,940 --> 02:01:17,800
Where the hell are you?

1972
02:01:17,940 --> 02:01:18,820
Change of plans.

1973
02:01:19,260 --> 02:01:20,460
You know where Mirror Peak is?

1974
02:01:20,780 --> 02:01:22,360
It's a big mountain north of where you are.

1975
02:01:22,680 --> 02:01:24,640
You follow the path from the mine you can't miss it.

1976
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:26,040
There's a lookout point there.

1977
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:26,800
Oh my god.

1978
02:01:27,740 --> 02:01:29,320
I'm through being jerked around by you.

1979
02:01:29,340 --> 02:01:30,680
You want to see your wife alive?

1980
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:34,000
Because if you do, you better watch what you say to me.

1981
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:35,540
Do we understand each other?

1982
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:47,640
I want to talk to Alice Yeah, and I want the manuscript
Don't keep me waiting, Wake Oh my god Hello I'm gonna kill

1983
02:01:47,640 --> 02:01:56,620
him I had to get to Mirror Peak No Why is this a guy's
obsession Yeah

1984
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:01,660
What's happening?

1985
02:02:04,580 --> 02:02:08,340
It was close Oh my god God, that scared the hell out of me.

1986
02:02:09,900 --> 02:02:10,980
How do I get out of here?

1987
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:12,740
Oh my gosh.

1988
02:02:14,840 --> 02:02:15,940
How do I get out of here?

1989
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,180
I'm lost.

1990
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:24,060
How did I get in here?

1991
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:28,660
Do I go up?

1992
02:02:30,140 --> 02:02:31,020
Alan's stuck?

1993
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:31,580
Yeah.

1994
02:02:34,080 --> 02:02:35,160
Alan trapped.

1995
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:36,860
Do I go down?

1996
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:37,920
Do I jump down?

1997
02:02:43,800 --> 02:02:44,000
Oh!

1998
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,380
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

1999
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:49,500
There probably was a better way.

2000
02:02:50,740 --> 02:02:52,260
I saw a green light over here.

2001
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:53,760
Oh, I see it there.

2002
02:02:54,960 --> 02:02:55,460
I'm stuck.

2003
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:03,270
Oh.

2004
02:03:03,810 --> 02:03:04,350
Ah, dang.

2005
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:06,370
I really thought that would be a light.

2006
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:10,630
Really thought...

2007
02:03:12,190 --> 02:03:13,630
Oh, I can't bring any more...

2008
02:03:13,650 --> 02:03:14,390
more batteries.

2009
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:16,210
You know what, maybe that's okay.

2010
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:17,050
We tap 20.

2011
02:03:17,250 --> 02:03:17,590
That's a lot.

2012
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,740
I see a manuscript down there.

2013
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,000
My knees.

2014
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:36,380
It was like a bit of a slide, and we just uh... He's just
old.

2015
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:38,220
He couldn't... I can tank it.

2016
02:03:38,300 --> 02:03:39,440
He can't tank it.

2017
02:03:39,720 --> 02:03:40,580
Alright, let's go.

2018
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:41,780
Through here.

2019
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:43,660
I'm guessing there's a ladder?

2020
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:49,200
No, we just Hmph!

2021
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:50,500
Hmph!

2022
02:03:52,350 --> 02:03:54,050
Whoa, down there.

2023
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:59,060
Um, nobody touched me.

2024
02:03:59,220 --> 02:03:59,920
I'm being a nerd.

2025
02:04:05,250 --> 02:04:06,470
Okay, nobody touched me.

2026
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:07,610
I need to read.

2027
02:04:09,430 --> 02:04:11,170
My, my show is on.

2028
02:04:12,870 --> 02:04:15,610
Thomas Zane in love with Barbara...

2029
02:04:16,750 --> 02:04:17,310
Barbara...

2030
02:04:17,310 --> 02:04:20,750
When Thomas Zane fell for Barbara Jagger, it happened fast.

2031
02:04:21,130 --> 02:04:23,830
She was young, vibrant, and beautiful, full of life.

2032
02:04:23,850 --> 02:04:28,030
He had never been a very happy man and without any seeming
effort.

2033
02:04:28,270 --> 02:04:35,210
She had changed all that Zane felt good for the first time
in his life Everything she did was another piece of a jigsaw

2034
02:04:35,210 --> 02:04:35,610
puzzle.

2035
02:04:35,790 --> 02:04:41,770
He hadn't even known he'd been missing and best of all She
made the words flow strong and sharp.

2036
02:04:42,610 --> 02:04:43,410
She was his muse.

2037
02:04:43,770 --> 02:04:45,610
She was his muse

2038
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:50,650
What was there anything else up?

2039
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:56,210
Oh, no, okay Music sounding real bad around here.

2040
02:04:56,610 --> 02:04:58,090
Real creepy stuff going on.

2041
02:04:58,630 --> 02:04:59,070
The weather.

2042
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:01,650
Look, you can still see the stars, though.

2043
02:05:02,310 --> 02:05:03,950
With all this fog, it's kind of impressive.

2044
02:05:10,690 --> 02:05:11,430
Pick up revolver.

2045
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:13,150
Thank you very much.

2046
02:05:13,610 --> 02:05:13,970
Pick up.

2047
02:05:14,710 --> 02:05:15,290
Oh, no.

2048
02:05:15,770 --> 02:05:16,230
Oh, no.

2049
02:05:16,330 --> 02:05:17,490
We have the...

2050
02:05:17,490 --> 02:05:18,690
We have the...

2051
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:19,550
Oh, no.

2052
02:05:19,750 --> 02:05:20,110
No!

2053
02:05:20,430 --> 02:05:22,850
We have the dumpster of ammo.

2054
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:25,150
That means bad things are surely going to happen.

2055
02:05:32,830 --> 02:05:33,330
Ow!

2056
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:42,130
Oh gosh, this guy.

2057
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:43,710
Oh my god!

2058
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:50,860
Yeah, get his butt, get his butt, get his butt.

2059
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:52,420
Ow!

2060
02:05:52,980 --> 02:05:53,480
Oh.

2061
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:55,380
Oh shoot.

2062
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,520
Oh shoot.

2063
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,260
Okay,

2064
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:08,120
we got the big guy.

2065
02:06:27,560 --> 02:06:28,060
No!

2066
02:06:28,320 --> 02:06:29,440
Are you kidding me right now?

2067
02:06:30,920 --> 02:06:31,920
Oh, God!

2068
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:36,780
This one too!

2069
02:06:43,290 --> 02:06:44,870
I'm going back for ammo.

2070
02:06:46,910 --> 02:06:48,890
Now we have to deal with guys.

2071
02:06:49,390 --> 02:06:51,030
We have to deal with...

2072
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:54,770
We have to deal with so much!

2073
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:57,650
Evil mine cart!

2074
02:06:58,290 --> 02:07:01,930
Wait, like all the spooky went away though.

2075
02:07:02,110 --> 02:07:03,150
That's cool, that's good.

2076
02:07:05,450 --> 02:07:06,470
Oh, that's not the right way.

2077
02:07:06,690 --> 02:07:08,090
I think through here is the right lane.

2078
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:13,050
Flashbangs!

2079
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:13,830
Oh yeah!

2080
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:15,470
Flashbangs, my beloved!

2081
02:07:19,510 --> 02:07:22,530
We'll equip the flashbangs over the flares for now.

2082
02:07:22,770 --> 02:07:24,410
Players are great too though, don't get me wrong.

2083
02:07:40,270 --> 02:07:41,410
And you thought.

2084
02:07:44,190 --> 02:07:45,370
You thought, eh?

2085
02:07:45,710 --> 02:07:47,190
Oh gosh, who's gonna come out here?

2086
02:07:48,450 --> 02:07:49,710
I need to go forward.

2087
02:07:51,090 --> 02:07:52,250
This is a museum?

2088
02:07:52,510 --> 02:07:52,910
How?

2089
02:07:53,090 --> 02:07:54,530
How do people get through here?

2090
02:07:56,330 --> 02:07:57,830
How do people navigate?

2091
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:00,350
They were wearing Adidas.

2092
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:02,410
Yeah, they looked very modern, didn't they?

2093
02:08:03,590 --> 02:08:03,990
Oh.

2094
02:08:05,090 --> 02:08:06,410
Oh, this is good.

2095
02:08:06,410 --> 02:08:08,410
It's gonna destroy the thing.

2096
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:15,510
Wait, can I get up here?

2097
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:24,620
Hello?

2098
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:27,580
Oh, I open it up.

2099
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:29,260
Wait, that sounds like a stupid idea.

2100
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:38,620
Where's the other one?

2101
02:08:40,060 --> 02:08:41,080
Where's the other one?

2102
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:49,030
Okay.

2103
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:52,270
Why is...

2104
02:08:52,890 --> 02:08:55,850
Why are the poles sparking everywhere?

2105
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:58,270
Oh my god.

2106
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:00,990
Is this place not maintained at all?

2107
02:09:01,490 --> 02:09:02,090
Like...

2108
02:09:02,090 --> 02:09:02,870
What is this?

2109
02:09:02,970 --> 02:09:04,390
This is the...

2110
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:06,530
Anyway.

2111
02:09:08,410 --> 02:09:09,390
Alan's stand.

2112
02:09:09,550 --> 02:09:10,770
Alan takes a stand.

2113
02:09:15,310 --> 02:09:16,410
Where am I?

2114
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:17,810
Where do I go?

2115
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:20,230
Alan I, Joe.

2116
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:27,630
Be there, be there, be there, My wife got kidnapped a long
time ago.

2117
02:09:28,590 --> 02:09:30,650
Where did we came from somewhere?

2118
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:31,610
But where did she go?

2119
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:32,550
Where did she go?

2120
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:32,970
What?

2121
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:35,450
Alan Wake's wife.

2122
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:55,400
What I miss?

2123
02:10:03,210 --> 02:10:04,870
Just heard a door open.

2124
02:10:14,030 --> 02:10:16,010
What I miss?

2125
02:10:17,130 --> 02:10:21,030
Sounds like a big lot of commotion in there, out here.

2126
02:10:25,230 --> 02:10:32,330
I only did what any logical person would do, which is shut
the door and wait for it to go away.

2127
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:41,710
Okay, this will probably be a checkpoint, and then we're
going to get ambushed.

2128
02:10:42,690 --> 02:10:46,230
I got my flashbangs on.

2129
02:10:49,170 --> 02:10:52,330
The only way to reach the hillside ahead was to go through
the building.

2130
02:10:52,350 --> 02:10:54,770
I had to find a way to avoid electrocution.

2131
02:10:55,130 --> 02:10:56,970
Oh, love that.

2132
02:10:57,550 --> 02:10:57,910
Okay.

2133
02:10:59,970 --> 02:11:01,450
Oh, I can't drive this.

2134
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:05,350
Okay, wait, can I...

2135
02:11:07,630 --> 02:11:08,230
Rubber...

2136
02:11:09,490 --> 02:11:10,090
Um...

2137
02:11:10,730 --> 02:11:11,330
Rubber...

2138
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,290
Rubber your tires.

2139
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:20,260
Who is coming over it?

2140
02:11:20,320 --> 02:11:21,060
Who's coming out?

2141
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:21,680
I'm scared.

2142
02:11:25,170 --> 02:11:26,410
Wait, hey, hey.

2143
02:11:30,790 --> 02:11:33,630
We've managed to avoid electrocution.

2144
02:11:35,930 --> 02:11:37,770
Okay, this seems kind of...

2145
02:11:37,770 --> 02:11:38,210
Okay, hold on.

2146
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:39,230
I'm going to go back to the car.

2147
02:11:39,670 --> 02:11:40,370
I'm taking the car.

2148
02:11:44,910 --> 02:11:45,950
Uh-oh.

2149
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:52,900
Holy ambush!

2150
02:11:53,660 --> 02:11:53,860
Ah!

2151
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,640
Oh, shoot.

2152
02:12:03,020 --> 02:12:04,040
Eyes out of it!

2153
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:06,160
Okay, that's a bit scary, so I'm scared.

2154
02:12:16,670 --> 02:12:18,950
Maybe I can kill them though.

2155
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:31,130
To the light!

2156
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:35,800
Hold on, I'll kill them all.

2157
02:12:37,500 --> 02:12:39,160
My road rage, yeah.

2158
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:40,540
Are

2159
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:52,650
you...

2160
02:12:57,480 --> 02:12:58,600
Yeah!

2161
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:03,720
Off the power.

2162
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:05,860
I don't like the sound of that, though.

2163
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:09,780
Anybody laughed?

2164
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:12,480
Doesn't seem like it.

2165
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:16,700
The car is OP.

2166
02:13:17,580 --> 02:13:18,420
It's my favorite thing.

2167
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:20,940
The car is...

2168
02:13:20,940 --> 02:13:23,340
A little worse for where?

2169
02:13:24,280 --> 02:13:25,480
It'll be okay, right?

2170
02:13:32,680 --> 02:13:34,040
It's only...

2171
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,400
Smoking a tiny tad.

2172
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:50,100
Checkpoint reached.

2173
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:53,820
Flare gun.

2174
02:13:54,640 --> 02:13:54,900
Okay.

2175
02:13:56,500 --> 02:13:57,900
No, I don't want that right now.

2176
02:13:58,240 --> 02:13:58,760
Thank you.

2177
02:13:59,180 --> 02:14:00,680
But I will reload you.

2178
02:14:04,240 --> 02:14:05,600
And reload you.

2179
02:14:07,600 --> 02:14:07,920
Alright.

2180
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:09,500
Everything's reloaded.

2181
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:11,260
Everything's just...

2182
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:12,520
Toji, good to go.

2183
02:14:13,500 --> 02:14:14,660
Nothing over here.

2184
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:18,300
Alright, let's turn off the power then.

2185
02:14:34,350 --> 02:14:35,610
Okay, that wouldn't break.

2186
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:37,270
It would just turn off the power.

2187
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:39,130
Oh my god, this thing is...

2188
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:41,630
Not doing so high.

2189
02:14:42,870 --> 02:14:43,990
Oh my god!

2190
02:14:54,460 --> 02:14:55,580
We lost the car!

2191
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,200
Okay, I was getting a preemptive, like maybe something
would, you know...

2192
02:15:14,260 --> 02:15:15,380
Where'd the other thing go?

2193
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:17,220
that was attacking me though.

2194
02:15:17,460 --> 02:15:18,460
Did I kill it?

2195
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:19,960
Oh no!

2196
02:15:25,330 --> 02:15:26,170
Oh shoot!

2197
02:15:28,490 --> 02:15:29,330
We're in trouble.

2198
02:15:31,310 --> 02:15:31,990
We're in big trouble.

2199
02:15:32,750 --> 02:15:33,450
We're in big trouble!

2200
02:15:33,910 --> 02:15:35,250
Oh shoot guys, we're in big trouble.

2201
02:15:36,290 --> 02:15:38,750
Oh, it

2202
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,920
starts there?

2203
02:15:45,140 --> 02:15:45,500
Oh shoot.

2204
02:15:46,140 --> 02:15:47,020
Guys, we're in big trouble.

2205
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,680
Okay, hold on.

2206
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:50,260
Maybe we do this.

2207
02:15:52,600 --> 02:15:53,160
The...

2208
02:15:53,160 --> 02:15:56,700
The big things that are gonna start attacking us.

2209
02:15:58,700 --> 02:16:00,100
Like that, right?

2210
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,140
Not one of them?

2211
02:16:04,120 --> 02:16:04,400
No?

2212
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:08,320
Do they only start coming out when I'm in the car?

2213
02:16:10,220 --> 02:16:11,280
That's so mean!

2214
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:13,860
Akashite!

2215
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:15,700
Thank you so much for the gift of daycare!

2216
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,120
Oh, geez.

2217
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:20,260
Okay, um...

2218
02:16:25,140 --> 02:16:28,140
It's just so difficult to drive the car!

2219
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:30,520
I'll try.

2220
02:16:31,680 --> 02:16:33,420
I'm just gonna run now.

2221
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:39,280
Insane driving.

2222
02:16:42,740 --> 02:16:43,720
Tank it!

2223
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:44,720
Tank it!

2224
02:16:48,320 --> 02:16:50,420
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

2225
02:16:52,020 --> 02:16:52,240
Ouch!

2226
02:16:52,860 --> 02:16:53,560
Drive, please!

2227
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:56,360
Ouch, oh my god.

2228
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:00,040
Oh shit!

2229
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:00,920
Please go!

2230
02:17:01,240 --> 02:17:01,940
Please go!

2231
02:17:01,940 --> 02:17:02,480
Please go!

2232
02:17:12,470 --> 02:17:14,470
Holy... Holy cow!

2233
02:17:15,050 --> 02:17:16,450
We made it!

2234
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:22,170
By the skin or by the hair of our chinny chin chin.

2235
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:24,330
We made it!

2236
02:17:25,130 --> 02:17:26,870
That was intense.

2237
02:17:28,110 --> 02:17:29,270
That was kind of insane.

2238
02:17:31,810 --> 02:17:32,710
Holy cow.

2239
02:17:36,320 --> 02:17:37,280
Good job.

2240
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:37,760
Yeah.

2241
02:17:39,480 --> 02:17:40,000
No.

2242
02:17:40,240 --> 02:17:41,620
I thought that was a thermos!

2243
02:17:44,240 --> 02:17:44,960
All right.

2244
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:48,900
I keep hearing a door opening.

2245
02:17:50,160 --> 02:17:51,840
And also, how do I get up there?

2246
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:53,020
What?

2247
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:54,840
Did I hear a...

2248
02:17:56,420 --> 02:17:56,940
No?

2249
02:17:57,140 --> 02:17:57,860
Okay, just kidding.

2250
02:17:59,540 --> 02:18:00,580
Is there...

2251
02:18:00,580 --> 02:18:01,460
a way to climb?

2252
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:03,940
Huh!

2253
02:18:08,200 --> 02:18:08,720
Hmm.

2254
02:18:08,720 --> 02:18:08,820
Hmm.

2255
02:18:09,480 --> 02:18:10,980
Maybe climb here.

2256
02:18:12,380 --> 02:18:13,480
And jump somewhere.

2257
02:18:13,780 --> 02:18:14,500
Can I jump there?

2258
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,240
Oh, wait.

2259
02:18:17,300 --> 02:18:18,380
Maybe these.

2260
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:24,500
And.

2261
02:18:25,680 --> 02:18:26,260
Okay.

2262
02:18:27,820 --> 02:18:28,640
Just kidding.

2263
02:18:28,860 --> 02:18:29,480
What the heck?

2264
02:18:29,540 --> 02:18:30,800
How am I supposed to get up there?

2265
02:18:34,300 --> 02:18:34,880
Oh,

2266
02:18:37,950 --> 02:18:38,550
I hate this.

2267
02:18:43,730 --> 02:18:47,550
Oh, I thought it was, like, gonna be 10 guys.

2268
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:55,280
Well.

2269
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:58,000
Uh.

2270
02:18:58,600 --> 02:19:00,520
I did darn mess that up.

2271
02:19:08,280 --> 02:19:08,600
No.

2272
02:19:09,300 --> 02:19:10,060
The checkpoint.

2273
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:11,220
No.

2274
02:19:11,520 --> 02:19:12,220
But my flare.

2275
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:13,500
My flashbang, I mean.

2276
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:16,200
So sad.

2277
02:19:22,130 --> 02:19:22,750
There's...

2278
02:19:22,850 --> 02:19:25,210
There's also, like, exploding things in here.

2279
02:19:44,680 --> 02:19:45,580
Hey, where are you going?

2280
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:54,860
I shot the one in the back.

2281
02:19:54,980 --> 02:19:55,640
I guess I missed.

2282
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,740
I really did think I shot that one, though, right there.

2283
02:19:59,180 --> 02:20:00,580
The tracksuits are too funny.

2284
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:05,060
They're so stylish.

2285
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:08,740
Like, why are they...

2286
02:20:08,740 --> 02:20:10,520
They're, like, coming in flexing on me.

2287
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:12,860
They look like...

2288
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:14,640
Like, a stylish gang or something.

2289
02:20:14,960 --> 02:20:15,540
So funny.

2290
02:20:16,380 --> 02:20:25,940
anyways that would have been a perfect time for the trust no
one in the dark do you guys hear that that wasn't me walking

2291
02:20:29,660 --> 02:20:33,560
that's scary I heard footsteps upstairs

2292
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:58,800
um this is another one of these situations where oh oh it's
a I thought okay I was pushing that over seeing if it would

2293
02:20:58,800 --> 02:21:03,780
like create a ramp There we go.

2294
02:21:05,620 --> 02:21:07,060
I'm not going to get ambushed, am I?

2295
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:13,180
What footsteps was I hearing?

2296
02:21:16,560 --> 02:21:17,080
Follow.

2297
02:21:18,200 --> 02:21:19,200
Yeah, I got that.

2298
02:21:19,360 --> 02:21:21,200
I think that's the only way I can go.

2299
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,880
Fancy chair.

2300
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:28,280
Quite out of place.

2301
02:21:33,390 --> 02:21:34,650
You hear it?

2302
02:21:34,690 --> 02:21:35,630
It scared me.

2303
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:48,610
um oh this one wake touched by the dark presence some of the
taken retained echoes of their former selves but these were

2304
02:21:48,610 --> 02:21:55,750
just the nerve twitches of a dead thing nothing remained but
a shell covered and filled with darkness in most cases these

2305
02:21:55,750 --> 02:22:01,910
puppets were enough for the purposes of the dark presence
but for anything more elaborate as with the writer it was

2306
02:22:01,910 --> 02:22:16,590
different it needed his mind completely it merely touched
him wow touched i'm touched honestly i'm touched okay

2307
02:22:16,590 --> 02:22:39,000
interesting yeah it needs my brain power to to um keep
writing all right who's up there i'm still here Okay, hold

2308
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:40,360
on, I'm surveying the area.

2309
02:22:43,660 --> 02:22:45,800
There's something there that's shining.

2310
02:22:47,900 --> 02:22:49,200
And a light, perhaps?

2311
02:22:51,780 --> 02:22:54,440
And, oh, there's that shack right there.

2312
02:22:55,580 --> 02:22:58,080
Because I didn't get like a checkpoint, so I'm like...

2313
02:22:58,680 --> 02:22:59,580
Who is up there?

2314
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:02,820

Okay, let's go do it.

2321
02:23:49,570 --> 02:23:50,970
Oh, this one.

2322
02:23:56,370 --> 02:23:59,210
I know it's probably gonna be a very slow gate too.

2323
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:09,560
There was no way the flashbang grenades were standard power
company equipment.

2324
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:11,160
Shocking.

2325
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:12,860
What?

2326
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:15,060
Oh my god.

2327
02:24:16,840 --> 02:24:17,360
What?

2328
02:24:19,180 --> 02:24:19,900
Huh.

2329
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:23,460
Fascinating.

2330
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:26,400
Okay, so I need to go this way?

2331
02:24:27,380 --> 02:24:28,880
But like, what's that direction?

2332
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:31,340
There's also that thing up there.

2333
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:34,380
We're reaching mirror peak.

2334
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:37,620
I feel like I need to look over here for a manuscript.

2335
02:24:43,020 --> 02:24:43,520
Alas.

2336
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:47,380
Maybe yellow?

2337
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:50,340
Nothing.

2338
02:24:50,660 --> 02:24:51,280
Okay, never mind.

2339
02:24:54,740 --> 02:24:56,290
Seems normal to be.

2340
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:03,070
Oh, it was the goop!

2341
02:25:03,510 --> 02:25:04,490
I forgot about the goop.

2342
02:25:05,770 --> 02:25:07,970
I was like, what am I attacking right now?

2343
02:25:10,850 --> 02:25:12,750
Oh yeah, there's goop on the ground.

2344
02:25:18,790 --> 02:25:19,590
Yeah, be gone?

2345
02:25:19,730 --> 02:25:20,310
Be gone?

2346
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:29,900
Oh, the checkpoint.

2347
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:31,980
Okay, cool.

2348
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:33,740
Any more goop around?

2349
02:25:35,560 --> 02:25:52,380
that goop if oh oh yes we do freshly stocked goop is that
scoop no okay I want to get all of it because if we have to

2350
02:25:52,380 --> 02:26:00,580
run back this way for whatever reason I don't want to get
hurt you know oh gosh I didn't even see that guy

2351
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:29,750
yeah oh more of Oh shoot,

2352
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:34,080
I didn't mean to...

2353
02:26:34,080 --> 02:26:34,840
Ah, big

2354
02:26:57,330 --> 02:26:57,410
go!

2355
02:26:58,050 --> 02:26:58,570
Yeah!

2356
02:26:59,670 --> 02:27:01,030
Yeah, cinematic.

2357
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,310
Dodge.

2358
02:27:02,730 --> 02:27:03,870
Oh my god, oh my god.

2359
02:27:04,410 --> 02:27:05,490
You're too powerful!

2360
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:13,800
Whop!

2361
02:27:14,060 --> 02:27:14,640
Ouchie, ouchie!

2362
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:15,740
Holy shit!

2363
02:27:18,480 --> 02:27:20,160
Oh my god, we almost died.

2364
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:21,800
Holy...

2365
02:27:21,800 --> 02:27:25,440
Oh, let's just stand here for a second and recover a bit.

2366
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:26,360
Holy cow.

2367
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:35,990
Prepare for trouble and make you devil.

2368
02:27:36,670 --> 02:27:38,310
Oh, let's let everything recharge.

2369
02:27:38,630 --> 02:27:38,950
Recharge?

2370
02:27:41,310 --> 02:27:42,250
Feel better?

2371
02:27:44,810 --> 02:27:47,510
Okay, my health is still slowly but surely.

2372
02:27:49,630 --> 02:27:51,690
Oh, barely made it.

2373
02:27:51,790 --> 02:27:52,450
Oh, my gosh.

2374
02:27:54,270 --> 02:27:56,690
I don't want to waste all my flashbangs, though.

2375
02:27:57,470 --> 02:27:59,230
Those guys are so tanky.

2376
02:27:59,890 --> 02:28:01,590
They're extremely tanky.

2377
02:28:06,210 --> 02:28:16,410
hello potion seller I'm going into battle and I want your
strongest potions you cannot handle my potions no more

2378
02:28:16,410 --> 02:28:26,550
shotgun I do have it probably would be better for those big
guys anyway you guys I don't know what's going on sometimes

2379
02:28:26,550 --> 02:28:40,690
you know Chitan like the mascot occasionally she'll just
like like my tweets I don't why it's

2380
02:28:45,230 --> 02:28:53,170

like cheetah and liked your tweet and i'm like really how

2381
02:28:53,170 --> 02:29:07,190
are you finding me so curious freak to freak communication
sounds about right okay let's take let's make bets guys who

2382
02:29:07,190 --> 02:29:13,970
thinks alice is alive raise your hand Wake and bury in the
cell.

2383
02:29:15,610 --> 02:29:17,490
I stared through the bars of the jail cell.

2384
02:29:18,230 --> 02:29:19,190
Barry stood behind me.

2385
02:29:19,370 --> 02:29:21,030
No, when did we get locked up?

2386
02:29:21,450 --> 02:29:21,910
As I felt.

2387
02:29:22,690 --> 02:29:25,970
Agent Nightingale stood on the other side of the bars with
Sheriff Breaker.

2388
02:29:27,090 --> 02:29:29,710
Nightingale had a stack of manuscript pages in his hand.

2389
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:31,950
He seemed unhinged as he gloated.

2390
02:29:32,690 --> 02:29:34,970
Well, I've got you now, Raymond Chandler.

2391
02:29:35,330 --> 02:29:36,190
It's all here.

2392
02:29:36,510 --> 02:29:40,150
All the evidence, including conspiracy to murder a federal
agent.

2393
02:29:40,310 --> 02:29:40,870
What?

2394
02:29:41,430 --> 02:29:42,670
It's a book!

2395
02:29:46,270 --> 02:29:48,210
You'd say Alice is alive?

2396
02:29:49,390 --> 02:29:51,210
I'll see it to believe it.

2397
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:53,390
Okay, checkpoint, thank goodness.

2398
02:29:59,940 --> 02:30:00,500
Spooky.

2399
02:30:02,660 --> 02:30:04,440
Oh wait, it's actually like guiding.

2400
02:30:05,800 --> 02:30:07,880
It's guiding me in the direction I need to go.

2401
02:30:08,720 --> 02:30:10,420
Wait, that was so...

2402
02:30:10,680 --> 02:30:11,620
But what's up there?

2403
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,780
Oh, it looks like a Tori gate.

2404
02:30:16,380 --> 02:30:16,900
Yellow.

2405
02:30:20,890 --> 02:30:21,950
Am I going to get ambushed, though?

2406
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:24,330
I just hit a checkpoint if I do get ambushed.

2407
02:30:26,350 --> 02:30:26,990
This way.

2408
02:30:27,610 --> 02:30:28,990
Oh my gosh, we're going through.

2409
02:30:32,690 --> 02:30:33,210
Ooh.

2410
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:35,510
This way.

2411
02:30:36,690 --> 02:30:37,170
Ooh.

2412
02:30:37,570 --> 02:30:37,850
Ooh.

2413
02:30:38,330 --> 02:30:38,990
What do we got?

2414
02:30:40,210 --> 02:30:41,270
American Tori gate.

2415
02:30:43,370 --> 02:30:44,190
All right.

2416
02:30:46,690 --> 02:30:47,850
More flashbangs.

2417
02:30:48,650 --> 02:30:49,870
We're a big fan of those.

2418
02:30:53,210 --> 02:30:53,710
Oh yeah.

2419
02:30:53,910 --> 02:30:54,470
Oh okay.

2420
02:30:55,070 --> 02:30:55,550
Oh yeah.

2421
02:30:59,540 --> 02:31:00,240
You tried.

2422
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:04,880
And flashbang!

2423
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:06,240
Whoa!

2424
02:31:10,890 --> 02:31:11,790
Oh my god.

2425
02:31:12,110 --> 02:31:12,110
Please!

2426
02:31:12,730 --> 02:31:12,930
Please!

2427
02:31:13,110 --> 02:31:13,430
Oh my god!

2428
02:31:13,510 --> 02:31:15,230
What's wrong with my...

2429
02:31:15,230 --> 02:31:16,910
trying to like...

2430
02:31:16,910 --> 02:31:18,630
Maneuver but... Oh my god.

2431
02:31:20,110 --> 02:31:20,950
There we go.

2432
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:32,660
I got all tripped up.

2433
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:33,460
There we go.

2434
02:31:34,380 --> 02:31:34,820
We're fine.

2435
02:31:35,320 --> 02:31:37,400
Okay, we got ambushed, but it wasn't so bad.

2436
02:31:39,460 --> 02:31:40,340
Could have been worse.

2437
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,700
Could have been much worse.

2438
02:31:45,080 --> 02:31:45,800
Oh, thermos.

2439
02:31:47,440 --> 02:31:48,320
Do I have to jump for this?

2440
02:31:49,280 --> 02:31:49,740
Oh, no.

2441
02:31:50,480 --> 02:31:52,500
Wait, I have to, like...

2442
02:31:53,360 --> 02:31:54,780
Skill check for the thermos?

2443
02:31:55,820 --> 02:31:56,180
Oh.

2444
02:31:57,060 --> 02:31:58,220
Look, we got this.

2445
02:31:58,740 --> 02:31:59,580
Skill check.

2446
02:32:00,060 --> 02:32:01,700
Oh, please.

2447
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:02,600
Thank you.

2448
02:32:02,600 --> 02:32:02,900
Thank you.

2449
02:32:03,140 --> 02:32:03,840
Please pick it up, Alan.

2450
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:04,840
Please, Alan.

2451
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:05,180
Alan.

2452
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:06,480
No, don't do that.

2453
02:32:06,980 --> 02:32:07,540
Oh, God.

2454
02:32:09,960 --> 02:32:10,660
Get in the light.

2455
02:32:11,300 --> 02:32:12,740
Get in the light, you bozo.

2456
02:32:15,820 --> 02:32:19,580
What the heck?

2457
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:22,940
Okay.

2458
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:24,640
All right.

2459
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:28,140
We'll go back to my revolver for now.

2460
02:32:28,820 --> 02:32:29,460
Oh, we do have shot.

2461
02:32:29,580 --> 02:32:31,820
was going to say unless we get more shotgun ammo.

2462
02:32:32,900 --> 02:32:34,140
Love that for us.

2463
02:32:35,260 --> 02:32:37,080
Oh, I'm out of room for batteries.

2464
02:32:37,500 --> 02:32:37,500
Okay.

2465
02:32:38,440 --> 02:32:39,120
Can't complain.

2466
02:32:39,320 --> 02:32:40,440
That means I have a lot of batteries.

2467
02:32:44,320 --> 02:32:45,580
All stocked up.

2468
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,780
That does concern me.

2469
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:51,900
I'm going to see if we reach a checkpoint over here, going
through here.

2470
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I don't think so.

2471
02:32:59,320 --> 02:33:00,240
I was hoping.

2472
02:33:02,700 --> 02:33:04,020
There was a shred of hope.

2473
02:33:04,180 --> 02:33:05,140
I had no real plan.

2474
02:33:05,800 --> 02:33:09,060
I was going to give the kidnapper all the manuscript pages I
had for Alice.

2475
02:33:09,680 --> 02:33:13,000
If that wasn't enough, I'd hold him at gunpoint and make him
talk.

2476
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:14,420
Comp action shotgun.

2477
02:33:17,260 --> 02:33:17,760
Whoa.

2478
02:33:19,120 --> 02:33:20,120
What is this?

2479
02:33:28,510 --> 02:33:29,970
There's something that way.

2480
02:33:39,450 --> 02:33:40,730
We like it.

2481
02:33:43,790 --> 02:33:47,730
I really wish I get a checkpoint, but just keep running.

2482
02:33:50,590 --> 02:33:52,370
Keep on going.

2483
02:33:55,450 --> 02:33:57,850
It's scaring me.

2484
02:33:58,190 --> 02:33:58,330
Wait!

2485
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:25,740
Hmm.

2486
02:34:27,260 --> 02:34:29,240
I think YouTube just died completely.

2487
02:34:29,640 --> 02:34:30,180
Oh no!

2488
02:34:31,220 --> 02:34:31,960
Wait, why?

2489
02:34:36,960 --> 02:34:38,260
Oh my god, there's more!

2490
02:34:39,740 --> 02:34:40,460
Wait, why?

2491
02:34:41,440 --> 02:34:41,800
Why?

2492
02:34:42,740 --> 02:34:44,380
Oh, why did I do that?

2493
02:34:45,480 --> 02:34:45,720
What?

2494
02:34:46,080 --> 02:34:47,400
Oh my gosh, I tried to dodge.

2495
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:48,300
I saw it.

2496
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:50,060
Oh my gosh!

2497
02:34:53,820 --> 02:34:54,920
I'm running towards the light.

2498
02:34:55,040 --> 02:34:55,420
Oh, shoot.

2499
02:34:55,620 --> 02:34:56,060
Oh, I'm dead.

2500
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:56,580
I'm so dead.

2501
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:57,320
I'm so dead.

2502
02:35:03,410 --> 02:35:04,130
Holy cow.

2503
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:10,040
Oh.

2504
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:20,860
More!!!!!

2505
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,140
Okay, do I just need to go?

2506
02:35:23,540 --> 02:35:25,620
Because like, what the hell is this?

2507
02:35:26,380 --> 02:35:27,360
Do I just need to run?

2508
02:35:29,560 --> 02:35:31,500
Oh my gosh, yeah.

2509
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:33,560
Kick your asses.

2510
02:35:34,260 --> 02:35:35,220
Oh, press- press play?

2511
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:35,720
Press play!

2512
02:35:36,260 --> 02:35:36,560
Ouch!

2513
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:37,160
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2514
02:35:41,520 --> 02:35:42,260
Press play!

2515
02:35:47,060 --> 02:35:49,420
Why do they keep showing up?

2516
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:51,560
The thermos I see you!

2517
02:35:51,780 --> 02:35:52,900
Wait, is there light in there?

2518
02:35:53,860 --> 02:35:55,260
Maybe it's worth...

2519
02:35:55,780 --> 02:35:56,740
Oh my gosh.

2520
02:35:57,840 --> 02:35:58,440
Oh my gosh.

2521
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:01,340
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

2522
02:36:03,940 --> 02:36:04,380
Ah!

2523
02:36:05,900 --> 02:36:07,820
Oh, okay, this was the checkpoint right here.

2524
02:36:07,960 --> 02:36:08,120
Okay.

2525
02:36:11,880 --> 02:36:13,660
I think I just need to keep running.

2526
02:36:13,920 --> 02:36:15,520
They just don't stop.

2527
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:22,860
Died so close to the light.

2528
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:26,880
They start running through the light though, they do.

2529
02:36:27,860 --> 02:36:32,020
If that wasn't enough, I'd hold him at gunpoint and make him
talk.

2530
02:36:36,010 --> 02:36:37,110
Keep running, running.

2531
02:36:37,330 --> 02:36:39,290
I think that's my only option.

2532
02:36:40,690 --> 02:36:42,570
Okay, alright, let's go.

2533
02:36:52,990 --> 02:36:54,490
Otherwise, it's just...

2534
02:36:59,820 --> 02:37:01,120
You guys get in the light?

2535
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:03,880
I'm stuck on a rock.

2536
02:37:04,620 --> 02:37:04,840
What?

2537
02:37:05,500 --> 02:37:05,600
Ouch.

2538
02:37:12,380 --> 02:37:12,940
Nice.

2539
02:37:13,360 --> 02:37:13,840
Double kill.

2540
02:37:16,360 --> 02:37:16,640
Yeah.

2541
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:18,240
Assholes.

2542
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:19,620
Okay, keep running.

2543
02:37:21,100 --> 02:37:22,020
Keep running.

2544
02:37:22,540 --> 02:37:24,360
Running, running, running, running, running.

2545
02:37:24,780 --> 02:37:26,460
Running, running, running, running.

2546
02:37:27,240 --> 02:37:28,700
Is this another light right here?

2547
02:37:29,220 --> 02:37:30,540
I don't actually know where I'm going.

2548
02:37:31,560 --> 02:37:32,400
I'm just running and running.

2549
02:37:33,900 --> 02:37:34,460
Okay.

2550
02:37:34,780 --> 02:37:35,880
Yeah, there's more guys.

2551
02:37:36,080 --> 02:37:36,480
We get it.

2552
02:37:36,600 --> 02:37:38,460
Oh, there's a lot of guys.

2553
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:39,500
We get it.

2554
02:37:40,320 --> 02:37:41,020
Turn it on!

2555
02:37:56,950 --> 02:37:57,910
Oh, she's...

2556
02:38:05,810 --> 02:38:08,330
Oh, this is so bad.

2557
02:38:10,110 --> 02:38:10,530
Oh.

2558
02:38:16,090 --> 02:38:17,230
This is tough.

2559
02:38:17,970 --> 02:38:18,990
I had no real plan.

2560
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:19,650
Nice parry.

2561
02:38:19,670 --> 02:38:22,950
I was going to give the kidnapper all the many discrepancies
I had for Alice.

2562
02:38:23,070 --> 02:38:23,470
Oh, I can.

2563
02:38:23,610 --> 02:38:26,990
If that wasn't enough, I'd hold him at gunpoint and make him
talk.

2564
02:38:27,150 --> 02:38:28,090
And make him talk.

2565
02:38:28,390 --> 02:38:28,550
Yeah, yeah.

2566
02:38:28,850 --> 02:38:29,290
This one.

2567
02:38:29,390 --> 02:38:31,370
Yeah, I should have flashbanged.

2568
02:38:31,390 --> 02:38:31,710

No, no, no, no, no.

2576
02:39:41,910 --> 02:39:42,470
You're my safety.

2577
02:39:42,870 --> 02:39:43,310
Turn back on.

2578
02:39:43,510 --> 02:39:44,650
Turn back on.

2579
02:39:44,750 --> 02:39:44,990
Turn on.

2580
02:39:45,530 --> 02:39:45,650
Okay.

2581
02:39:46,010 --> 02:39:47,210
We're just gonna keep going.

2582
02:39:49,190 --> 02:39:49,650
Okay.

2583
02:39:50,490 --> 02:39:52,630
Oh, don't turn off.

2584
02:39:52,990 --> 02:39:53,310
Please.

2585
02:39:54,390 --> 02:39:54,690
Please.

2586
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:14,900
The dark presence was moving ahead of me in the same
direction I was going.

2587
02:40:15,240 --> 02:40:25,000
A cold feeling settled at in the pit of my stomach was it
going for Alice that don't look good also all these graves a

2588
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:38,240
little freaky I do wonder if these places are like
maintained still oh the graveyard shift may cause cancer

2589
02:40:38,240 --> 02:40:43,400
what oh my god you're fast oh no you're one of these types
oh my god no

2590
02:40:50,140 --> 02:40:51,860
Oh my gosh, there's more than one!

2591
02:40:53,360 --> 02:40:54,020
Flashbang!

2592
02:40:55,060 --> 02:40:57,120
Oh my god, I'm trying to...

2593
02:40:59,770 --> 02:41:00,100
You!

2594
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:03,120
A graveyard shift!

2595
02:41:09,170 --> 02:41:09,830
And...

2596
02:41:09,830 --> 02:41:11,250
Oh my god, I can't get him.

2597
02:41:14,750 --> 02:41:15,550
What are you doing?

2598
02:41:17,670 --> 02:41:18,150
Yeah.

2599
02:41:22,420 --> 02:41:23,360
That's right.

2600
02:41:23,440 --> 02:41:25,380
why would it cause cancer

2601
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:39,380
okay I'm gonna let myself recharge a little bit he got stuck

2602
02:41:44,610 --> 02:41:51,250
give me one second guys I just spilled water all over myself
one second

2603
02:41:57,380 --> 02:42:00,940
I need to get that right I had to get I'm like a napkin.

2604
02:42:03,660 --> 02:42:03,960
Oopsie.

2605
02:42:04,420 --> 02:42:04,960
Okay.

2606
02:42:06,200 --> 02:42:07,760
We're back at it.

2607
02:42:09,200 --> 02:42:11,400
Cells go crazy from stress.

2608
02:42:12,120 --> 02:42:12,720
Is that true?

2609
02:42:13,900 --> 02:42:14,380
Oh geez.

2610
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,320
Oh my god, I got it all over my dress and everything.

2611
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:28,660
I think I'm potentially headed the right direction.

2612
02:42:39,280 --> 02:42:39,880
Use?

2613
02:42:41,160 --> 02:42:41,580
Oh!

2614
02:42:42,300 --> 02:42:43,280
We love it!

2615
02:42:44,040 --> 02:42:47,600
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes!

2616
02:42:50,220 --> 02:42:52,580
Not stress, it's the coal in this context.

2617
02:42:53,020 --> 02:42:54,920
Oh, wait, we just double checkpointed?

2618
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:56,420
Interesting.

2619
02:43:01,690 --> 02:43:03,790
I thought this thing was gonna become darkness.

2620
02:43:07,290 --> 02:43:07,710
Hello?

2621
02:43:09,170 --> 02:43:10,730
Was that that that just fell?

2622
02:43:15,470 --> 02:43:16,450
I don't know.

2623
02:43:16,770 --> 02:43:19,010
In the second episode, there was that dog, right?

2624
02:43:19,310 --> 02:43:23,090
I don't know why we thought, why I thought we would have a
dog in this game.

2625
02:43:25,930 --> 02:43:27,990
I wonder if it's because of John Wick.

2626
02:43:36,330 --> 02:43:41,350
The place was dead, a ghost town, had been for decades,
maybe a century.

2627
02:43:43,910 --> 02:43:45,350
Oh, that's weird.

2628
02:43:45,890 --> 02:43:46,070
What the?

2629
02:43:46,330 --> 02:43:47,730
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2630
02:43:48,650 --> 02:43:49,370
Okay, chill.

2631
02:43:54,470 --> 02:43:56,830
I'll get you.

2632
02:43:58,110 --> 02:43:58,530
Hey.

2633
02:43:59,630 --> 02:44:01,410
That was close!

2634
02:44:02,990 --> 02:44:04,150
Holy cow.

2635
02:44:05,010 --> 02:44:06,430
We barely made that.

2636
02:44:08,290 --> 02:44:09,610
Evil car.

2637
02:44:10,750 --> 02:44:11,830
Evil car.

2638
02:44:12,230 --> 02:44:12,390
Okay.

2639
02:44:13,550 --> 02:44:16,330
I like to wait for my flashlight to reload, you know.

2640
02:44:16,670 --> 02:44:17,550
Is there anything in there?

2641
02:44:18,430 --> 02:44:19,690
Looks like a whole lot of nothing.

2642
02:44:20,930 --> 02:44:22,450
Wait, is there like a staircase here?

2643
02:44:23,390 --> 02:44:24,530
No, it's a wall.

2644
02:44:26,870 --> 02:44:29,470
Looking for more manuscript pages, please.

2645
02:44:30,790 --> 02:44:31,310
Oh, the...

2646
02:44:31,310 --> 02:44:34,030
Oh, speaking, you shall receive.

2647
02:44:41,660 --> 02:44:42,720
I think I...

2648
02:44:42,720 --> 02:44:43,960
I can't tell if I missed it.

2649
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:49,780
I know they kind of like show up random, not in order all
the time, so you're like, we got this one.

2650
02:44:49,900 --> 02:44:50,820
But I wonder if I missed that.

2651
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:53,500
Things were never as simple in real life as in fiction.

2652
02:44:55,040 --> 02:44:58,720
count of the times I had wished there'd be a clear reason
for my writer's block.

2653
02:44:59,220 --> 02:44:59,880
Something to fight.

2654
02:45:00,380 --> 02:45:01,500
Something to lash out on.

2655
02:45:02,280 --> 02:45:02,860
There wasn't.

2656
02:45:03,300 --> 02:45:04,440
I was filled with doubt.

2657
02:45:04,820 --> 02:45:06,760
I was nothing like the hero in my books.

2658
02:45:07,560 --> 02:45:10,720
Alex Casey had gone through his life with single-minded
determination.

2659
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:12,320
Never wavering from his goal.

2660
02:45:13,020 --> 02:45:14,920
Even now, I was angry at myself.

2661
02:45:15,480 --> 02:45:16,160
Angry at Alice.

2662
02:45:16,480 --> 02:45:17,380
Angry at Barry.

2663
02:45:18,000 --> 02:45:19,860
I was fumbling and I had no plan.

2664
02:45:19,960 --> 02:45:21,640
Why are you angry at Alice?

2665
02:45:21,940 --> 02:45:22,880
What did she do?

2666
02:45:23,220 --> 02:45:25,020
Oh my gosh, misplaced anger.

2667
02:45:25,040 --> 02:45:37,460
for real what the hell i was angry at my wife for not giving
me ideas oh i thought i needed to jump that how dare she go

2668
02:45:37,460 --> 02:45:50,120
and get kidnapped you know what that sounds like a great
great uh inspiration for another book cray payer oh gray

2669
02:45:50,120 --> 02:46:16,220
peak Gray Peak Gorge Gray Pear Originally founded in 1928
The Gray Peak Gorge mining town Was one of the permanent

2670
02:46:16,220 --> 02:46:24,040
settlements Of the Bright Falls mining company Built for its
workers The nearby graveyard is a testament To the dangers

2671
02:46:24,040 --> 02:46:31,380
the miners faced on a daily basis Most of the men who lost
their lives the years we're burnt we're we're here last wait

2672
02:46:31,380 --> 02:46:40,780
over the years here where we're we're buried there english
is hard a grim reminder to be careful for those who remained

2673
02:46:40,780 --> 02:46:45,440
gray peak gorge was a a

2674
02:46:48,680 --> 02:46:55,060
abandoned over almost overnight when the bright falls mining
company closed its doors in

2675
02:46:58,860 --> 02:46:59,980
I can read.

2676
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:01,000
I promise.

2677
02:47:03,660 --> 02:47:08,280
It is really cool, though, that, like, you see an area and
most likely you're going to go to it.

2678
02:47:08,580 --> 02:47:10,280
Like, it feels very...

2679
02:47:11,300 --> 02:47:15,840
Like, you know, the game itself feels really cool in that.

2680
02:47:16,140 --> 02:47:17,080
Come on, you can do it!

2681
02:47:24,280 --> 02:47:26,540
Like, open world positive.

2682
02:47:28,040 --> 02:47:28,880
It's pretty fun.

2683
02:47:34,190 --> 02:47:34,670
Thermos?

2684
02:47:35,510 --> 02:47:36,130
My everything.

2685
02:47:36,730 --> 02:47:38,110
Wait, there's some more stuff over here too.

2686
02:47:39,630 --> 02:47:40,930
Battery, which I don't need.

2687
02:47:47,410 --> 02:47:49,130
This Alan can't use his arms.

2688
02:47:51,810 --> 02:47:52,710
What's in here?

2689
02:47:55,730 --> 02:47:57,410
Dark Souls is like that too.

2690
02:47:59,210 --> 02:48:00,050
I'm sure.

2691
02:48:00,770 --> 02:48:01,610
I'm sure it is.

2692
02:48:03,430 --> 02:48:04,250
Noodle arms.

2693
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:05,150
Look, he's a geek.

2694
02:48:05,290 --> 02:48:05,870
He can't help it.

2695
02:48:08,190 --> 02:48:20,240
I'm like hearing so many noises I'm just trying to find
pages I'm also hearing like which makes me think there's a

2696
02:48:20,240 --> 02:48:37,620
secret nearby let's see can we get inside here doesn't seem
like it okay it's awfully quiet he's a rider there's a

2697
02:48:37,640 --> 02:48:43,720
difference so I have to cross the ghost town and

2700
02:49:27,320 --> 02:49:33,200
I think for that one I need to uh do the what's it called

2701
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:47,440
the that bad boy this guy right here wait am I going the
right way this way this away and then there were more

2702
02:49:47,440 --> 02:49:54,740
batteries in that building so once we're done with these
guys we can yeah flashback The flare bang.

2703
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,960
Flare, God would be good here.

2704
02:49:57,080 --> 02:49:58,120
Oh, you're right.

2705
02:49:59,480 --> 02:50:00,500
Oh, you're right.

2706
02:50:00,740 --> 02:50:02,440
I think it's...

2707
02:50:04,480 --> 02:50:04,580
Oh!

2708
02:50:05,300 --> 02:50:05,580
Ouch!

2709
02:50:05,760 --> 02:50:06,340
Oh my gosh.

2710
02:50:06,660 --> 02:50:07,280
Chill out.

2711
02:50:11,100 --> 02:50:12,640
For these two, though, I don't mind.

2712
02:50:14,700 --> 02:50:14,880
Oh!

2713
02:50:19,040 --> 02:50:21,360
It went out of bounds, so it doesn't count.

2714
02:50:31,360 --> 02:50:31,960
Oh my gosh.

2715
02:50:31,980 --> 02:50:32,580
Oh my god!

2716
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:34,560
Oh, come on!

2717
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:47,970
My biggest enemy is the...

2718
02:50:47,970 --> 02:50:50,410
It's the tag.

2719
02:50:51,670 --> 02:50:53,590
It always puts me backwards.

2720
02:50:56,510 --> 02:50:58,310
The inanimate objects.

2721
02:50:59,450 --> 02:51:01,050
It's because I'm like trying to tank them.

2722
02:51:05,630 --> 02:51:06,550
Okay.

2723
02:51:13,380 --> 02:51:18,060
There you go, there we go.

2724
02:51:18,360 --> 02:51:20,660
All right, let me let my flashlight.

2725
02:51:21,380 --> 02:51:26,300
Let me let my flashlight redo.

2726
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:36,720
And then we'll just hide behind this guinea bull's little
string bean, string bean, Allen string bean here.

2727
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:38,240
All right.

2728
02:51:40,500 --> 02:51:47,020
I guess my Flare missed before And that's why it didn't work
I'm assuming

2729
02:51:50,980 --> 02:51:52,800
Okay, can I run?

2730
02:51:53,060 --> 02:51:55,820
Oh my gosh Oh, dang it

2731
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:04,400
Woo Time

2732
02:52:12,580 --> 02:52:15,900
They're so annoying And so stupid at the same time

2733
02:52:20,440 --> 02:52:25,080
There's just There's They annoy me!

2734
02:52:27,460 --> 02:52:28,060
Okay.

2735
02:52:32,140 --> 02:52:34,080
Stupid and annoying go hand in hand.

2736
02:52:34,880 --> 02:52:35,560
Not always.

2737
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:37,420
Sometimes.

2738
02:52:38,540 --> 02:52:42,880
I think you can be annoying but not stupid.

2739
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:45,600
But I think most stupid people are annoying.

2740
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:48,020
You know what I mean.

2741
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,660
How much more of this chapter do I have?

2742
02:52:52,560 --> 02:52:55,720
golly all right keep it going keep it coming

2743
02:53:02,120 --> 02:53:04,460
that didn't sound good

2744
02:53:09,260 --> 02:53:18,100
uh let's go back to my gun even let's agree to disagree here

2745
02:53:23,640 --> 02:53:29,980

2746
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:41,900
there's another bit.

2747
02:53:44,580 --> 02:53:45,320
You're okay.

2748
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:48,880
Oh,

2749
02:53:54,520 --> 02:53:56,060
Yeah, a little more.

2750
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:58,660
There we go.

2751
02:54:01,560 --> 02:54:02,560
What was that game?

2752
02:54:02,900 --> 02:54:05,440
Choo-choo Charles or something about the evil...

2753
02:54:05,440 --> 02:54:07,140
The evil...

2754
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:08,960
Train.

2755
02:54:12,340 --> 02:54:13,460
Got flashbacks.

2756
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:20,380
Alright, I don't want to waste these so much either, too,
so.

2757
02:54:22,800 --> 02:54:23,400
Pick up.

2758
02:54:23,860 --> 02:54:24,460
What did I grab?

2759
02:54:24,560 --> 02:54:25,260
Oh, a key!

2760
02:54:26,220 --> 02:54:27,200
Okay, interesting.

2761
02:54:28,760 --> 02:54:29,720
Choo-choo taros!

2762
02:54:29,940 --> 02:54:31,580
It was pretty fun from what I remember.

2763
02:54:35,300 --> 02:54:38,340
Silly horror is so good at the same time.

2764
02:54:40,080 --> 02:54:58,390
love me a really creepy horror but silly horror is also so
good okay it's like I'm constantly trying the the door knob

2765
02:54:58,390 --> 02:55:10,790
oh yes yes more flare gun ammo yes yes good yes yes oh
anything outside of riding is a struggle I feel ill I

2766
02:55:10,790 --> 02:55:17,730
managed to make my way downstairs there's a shoebox filled
with books and papers by thomas zane it's very hard to say

2767
02:55:17,730 --> 02:55:24,630
for action managed to read some of it he's a poet and a good
one he writes of muses and creators summoning fabulous

2768
02:55:24,630 --> 02:55:31,530
things from a magic lake using his powers to shape the world
of a realm of gods and dreams and demons dark things that

2769
02:55:31,530 --> 02:55:39,670
wait for a chance to slip through wearing the flesh of men
as disguise zane writes about himself his girlfriend being

2770
02:55:39,670 --> 02:55:43,290
taken over by a dark presence About growing scared of the
lake.

2771
02:55:44,250 --> 02:55:47,110
Zane believes it's a mirror to the gaping void of darkness
above.

2772
02:55:47,190 --> 02:55:49,270
Where some love crafty and presence lurks.

2773
02:55:50,130 --> 02:55:50,990
I crawled back upstairs.

2774
02:55:51,750 --> 02:55:53,170
I'll borrow these things from my story.

2775
02:55:53,630 --> 02:55:54,250
They ring true.

2776
02:55:54,970 --> 02:55:55,430
They fit.

2777
02:56:00,090 --> 02:56:01,050
His face.

2778
02:56:04,450 --> 02:56:05,850
Mr. Wake, are you okay?

2779
02:56:08,770 --> 02:56:09,610
Oh, what's this?

2780
02:56:10,470 --> 02:56:11,070
Oh, wait.

2781
02:56:11,070 --> 02:56:14,070
We can only have either the, uh, what's it called, right?

2782
02:56:15,870 --> 02:56:17,150
Which would be better?

2783
02:56:17,390 --> 02:56:20,890
The shotgun that I have, or is the hunting rifle better?

2784
02:56:23,970 --> 02:56:25,170
Alan plagiarized.

2785
02:56:29,590 --> 02:56:31,270
Hunting rifle is one shot.

2786
02:56:31,550 --> 02:56:32,090
It is?

2787
02:56:36,480 --> 02:56:40,140
I don't, wait, how much, how many bullets do I have for a
shotgun?

2788
02:56:40,740 --> 02:56:45,840
Honestly, I have 15 versus, uh, 11.

2789
02:56:48,500 --> 02:56:49,280
So...

2790
02:56:49,280 --> 02:56:50,100
Alright, here we go.

2791
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:52,140
I'm scared.

2792
02:56:57,260 --> 02:56:58,820
I'm scared.

2793
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:01,920
Oh.

2794
02:57:08,130 --> 02:57:08,690
Darkness!

2795
02:57:12,090 --> 02:57:12,870
Anyway.

2796
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:23,660
Don't come out of there.

2797
02:57:25,880 --> 02:57:27,060
How much more!

2798
02:57:28,600 --> 02:57:30,340
This chapter does drag.

2799
02:57:36,100 --> 02:57:37,220
Let's see.

2800
02:57:37,220 --> 02:57:37,520
Oh?

2801
02:57:38,540 --> 02:57:38,920
Who?

2802
02:57:40,240 --> 02:57:40,800
Secret?

2803
02:57:41,700 --> 02:57:42,260
Secret?

2804
02:57:43,020 --> 02:57:43,580
Secret?

2805
02:57:43,960 --> 02:57:43,960
Where?

2806
02:57:45,720 --> 02:57:46,700
Be do, be do.

2807
02:57:46,980 --> 02:57:48,720
The kidnapper had sent me a text.

2808
02:57:49,340 --> 02:57:52,160
The message was full of spelling errors and insults.

2809
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:53,740
It was telling me to hurry up.

2810
02:57:55,140 --> 02:57:56,040
Calm down.

2811
02:57:56,480 --> 02:57:58,360
I'm trying to find the secret passage.

2812
02:57:59,100 --> 02:57:59,940
Oh, it's got to be this way.

2813
02:58:00,120 --> 02:58:00,440
Yeah.

2814
02:58:01,920 --> 02:58:02,480
Nice.

2815
02:58:05,180 --> 02:58:19,580
Alan Wake would never yes nice he would never ever ever
plagiarize he wouldn't do that to us and all that we've

2816
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:32,570
worked hard for right Alan Wake Alan Loop Loot Goblin unless

2817
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:53,080
nice Alan Wake is gonna like birds birds oh shoot not the
birds he's gonna he's gonna be like I have a crazy idea for

2818
02:58:53,080 --> 02:59:02,440
a thing it's called like weirder creatures weirder stuff you
know I'm never stranger things what's that no no I'm talking

2819
02:59:02,440 --> 02:59:08,720
about weirder stuff my original idea my original TV show
where's the bird show

2820
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:13,120
Holy banger.

2821
02:59:16,080 --> 02:59:17,400
Why am I not attacking them?

2822
02:59:24,770 --> 02:59:25,730
Unusual items.

2823
02:59:27,530 --> 02:59:28,690
They're too far?

2824
02:59:28,930 --> 02:59:29,910
They're pretty close to me.

2825
02:59:31,870 --> 02:59:33,050
This is close.

2826
02:59:34,010 --> 02:59:36,210
This is close, and it's still not getting them.

2827
02:59:37,150 --> 02:59:40,290
Maybe I need to keep going, and then they start coming after
me.

2828
02:59:41,450 --> 02:59:42,950
Maybe it's one of those situations.

2829
02:59:43,350 --> 02:59:43,730
Oh,

2830
02:59:47,210 --> 02:59:47,790
yeah, yeah, yeah.

2831
02:59:50,820 --> 02:59:51,100
Yeah.

2832
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:53,500
It's like a time thing.

2833
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:55,200
Oh, the currances.

2834
02:59:56,400 --> 02:59:57,640
No, no, more than...

2835
02:59:57,640 --> 02:59:57,820
Oh!

2836
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:03,980
Oh, my God.

2837
03:00:05,220 --> 03:00:06,980
Get your barge.

2838
03:00:15,300 --> 03:00:15,680
Oh, shoot.

2839
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:16,220
Ah!

2840
03:00:21,680 --> 03:00:22,720
It's scary.

2841
03:00:22,960 --> 03:00:26,080
It's scarier when they do the thematic stuff like that.

2842
03:00:26,660 --> 03:00:28,300
Competitions for big chairs.

2843
03:00:28,400 --> 03:00:29,500
What the heck does that mean?

2844
03:00:31,620 --> 03:00:35,080
Bird, bird, bird, birds, birds, birds attacking.

2845
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:38,740
They're coming after you and you gotta run and run and run.

2846
03:00:42,080 --> 03:00:42,940
Oh, never mind.

2847
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:47,300
We're going into the mines?

2848
03:00:47,440 --> 03:00:49,200
That doesn't seem very safe.

2849
03:00:50,980 --> 03:00:51,380
Okay.

2850
03:00:52,220 --> 03:00:53,340
We're doing this.

2851
03:00:55,580 --> 03:00:56,080
Why?

2852
03:00:56,100 --> 03:01:01,940
This seems like the actual worst idea that we ever could
have had.

2853
03:01:03,360 --> 03:01:05,980
Exit the silver mine.

2854
03:01:07,520 --> 03:01:08,520
Gladly.

2855
03:01:16,050 --> 03:01:16,210
What?

2856
03:01:17,050 --> 03:01:17,550
Alan mine?

2857
03:01:18,990 --> 03:01:20,410
But do Alan craft?

2858
03:01:26,990 --> 03:01:27,630
Tunnels?

2859
03:01:27,990 --> 03:01:28,410
Tunnels?

2860
03:01:30,250 --> 03:01:33,110
Tunnels to Cauldron Lake.

2861
03:01:34,670 --> 03:01:35,130
Oh!

2862
03:01:38,090 --> 03:01:38,910
Alice?

2863
03:01:55,670 --> 03:01:56,490
What?

2864
03:01:57,570 --> 03:01:58,890
Are you down here?

2865
03:02:02,250 --> 03:02:02,370
What?

2866
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:02,970
What?

2867
03:02:03,070 --> 03:02:04,550
Tunnels go to Cauldron Lake.

2868
03:02:05,030 --> 03:02:05,410
Okay.

2869
03:02:07,210 --> 03:02:10,030
Without looning,

2870
03:02:19,550 --> 03:02:21,250
the headache stabbed at my brain.

2871
03:02:21,330 --> 03:02:21,690
Oh.

2872
03:02:22,950 --> 03:02:23,770
Okay.

2873
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:34,180
I'm coming.

2874
03:02:35,140 --> 03:02:35,920
I'm coming.

2875
03:02:36,820 --> 03:02:37,120
Alice?

2876
03:02:41,860 --> 03:02:43,360
Oh my god.

2877
03:02:45,620 --> 03:02:46,340
I'm coming.

2878
03:02:49,520 --> 03:02:50,960
I'm losing it.

2879
03:02:51,380 --> 03:02:52,300
I gotta get out of here.

2880
03:02:55,240 --> 03:02:56,000
Is that the lake?

2881
03:02:56,240 --> 03:02:56,940
What if I go in?

2882
03:02:59,520 --> 03:03:00,700
He faked out.

2883
03:03:01,020 --> 03:03:01,940
He was like, I'm gonna do it.

2884
03:03:02,460 --> 03:03:03,280
No, just kidding.

2885
03:03:12,140 --> 03:03:13,940
Let's see what we got here.

2886
03:03:15,700 --> 03:03:16,520
Hunters taken.

2887
03:03:16,700 --> 03:03:20,340
The hunters were big, thick-set men, confident and at home
in the woods.

2888
03:03:20,820 --> 03:03:25,120
They were feeling good, running on beer and ghost stories
and camaraderie late into the night.

2889
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:31,600
It did them no good, as they were taken by the dark
presence, sucked deep into a darkness far worse than any

2890
03:03:31,600 --> 03:03:37,400
ghost story they ever Yeah, those guys suck.

2891
03:03:38,660 --> 03:03:40,340
We do not like the hunters.

2892
03:03:40,860 --> 03:03:43,640
I'm guessing those are like the big, big guys that I've been
fighting.

2893
03:03:48,790 --> 03:03:49,290
Hmm.

2894
03:03:52,940 --> 03:03:54,560
That was a little fun detour.

2895
03:03:55,160 --> 03:03:56,060
I liked that.

2896
03:03:56,820 --> 03:03:58,920
Quite spooky and interesting.

2897
03:03:59,640 --> 03:04:01,860
So that was the lake though.

2898
03:04:03,100 --> 03:04:05,940
Like that was just that it looked like a like a tar pit.

2899
03:04:09,780 --> 03:04:11,180
Mmm, soup.

2900
03:04:12,980 --> 03:04:13,620
Spokely.

2901
03:04:14,340 --> 03:04:17,520
You know, what scary stories are they talking about?

2902
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:19,160
I wonder what ghost stories they have.

2903
03:04:26,480 --> 03:04:27,120
Okay.

2904
03:04:27,700 --> 03:04:29,520
We're still trying to...

2905
03:04:29,520 --> 03:04:31,380
We're back in the mines.

2906
03:04:32,080 --> 03:04:35,440
Trying to figure out where my wife went.

2907
03:04:37,400 --> 03:04:38,040
My...

2908
03:04:38,040 --> 03:04:40,940
Was that in the game or was that my computer?

2909
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:45,750
Sorry, I'm double checking down here.

2910
03:04:47,160 --> 03:04:47,840
Okay, nothing.

2911
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:50,320
There was like a creaking noise.

2912
03:04:51,320 --> 03:04:52,040
It was in the game.

2913
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:52,660
Okay, good.

2914
03:04:53,820 --> 03:04:54,880
I was like, uh-oh.

2915
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:56,760
What's going on with like a fever?

2916
03:05:01,970 --> 03:05:03,810
Let's switch to our flares, actually.

2917
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:10,680
Oh, I was like, what's that?

2918
03:05:11,040 --> 03:05:11,860
That light.

2919
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:13,340
Shining light.

2920
03:05:15,960 --> 03:05:17,040
And some more ammo.

2921
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:23,700
and stuff that does not instill confidence in me that
something won't happen in here

2922
03:05:27,500 --> 03:05:35,860
more pages i think i missed two dang it i think i really did
even behind the closed doors and curtains of his grimy room

2923
03:05:35,860 --> 03:05:42,400
at the majestic the local motel nightingale could feel the
locals eyes on him the unrelenting pressure of their

2924
03:05:42,400 --> 03:05:48,040
judgment he forced it out of his mind for all he knew they
Wake's spell already.

2925
03:05:48,700 --> 03:05:50,560
You do what you have to do to get the job done.

2926
03:05:51,260 --> 03:05:52,940
He took comfort from the bottom of his hand.

2927
03:05:53,740 --> 03:05:54,140
Please, he thought.

2928
03:05:54,760 --> 03:05:55,860
Just let me get through this.

2929
03:05:56,060 --> 03:05:58,640
My, wait, Alan Wake's spell?

2930
03:05:59,100 --> 03:06:00,140
What am I, a witch?

2931
03:06:00,740 --> 03:06:09,240
Like, some are behind the hardest difficulty, but it's only
the ones with the little symbols that you see here.

2932
03:06:09,400 --> 03:06:12,740
So there's these two that I feel like I missed.

2933
03:06:14,160 --> 03:06:19,080
But other three, five left.

2934
03:06:20,420 --> 03:06:21,100
Five left.

2935
03:06:22,460 --> 03:06:23,320
Here, oh.

2936
03:06:23,960 --> 03:06:25,900
That looks like the way out.

2937
03:06:29,540 --> 03:06:29,880
Uh-oh.

2938
03:06:33,260 --> 03:06:34,260
Uh-huh.

2939
03:06:34,680 --> 03:06:36,340
It's not gonna collapse on us, is it?

2940
03:06:36,800 --> 03:06:37,320
Okay.

2941
03:06:51,680 --> 03:06:52,240
Oh,

2942
03:06:59,140 --> 03:06:59,220
shoot.

2943
03:07:05,950 --> 03:07:06,550
Where are you?

2944
03:07:06,750 --> 03:07:09,310
Actually, the player kind of...

2945
03:07:09,310 --> 03:07:09,490
Woo!

2946
03:07:24,420 --> 03:07:24,980
Yeah!

2947
03:07:25,600 --> 03:07:25,820
Ooh!

2948
03:07:26,300 --> 03:07:27,400
Hunting rifles good!

2949
03:07:27,660 --> 03:07:28,640
Ouch, I tried to dodge.

2950
03:07:39,940 --> 03:07:40,500
Nice.

2951
03:07:41,720 --> 03:07:42,280
Nice!

2952
03:07:42,660 --> 03:07:43,620
Oh, not nice.

2953
03:07:43,640 --> 03:08:00,440
so not nice good shot thank you thank you team i would like
to thank oh my goodness my flashlight for for uh let's now

2954
03:08:00,440 --> 03:08:08,320
wait what's happening oh i'm getting a visual glitch again
at least i can like fix that very easily oh i forgot that i

2955
03:08:08,320 --> 03:08:14,880
didn't use my revolver at all You can fix the visual glitch
very easily by just pausing and continuing.

2956
03:08:16,820 --> 03:08:17,260
Okay.

2957
03:08:18,420 --> 03:08:18,860
Thermus.

2958
03:08:24,470 --> 03:08:25,830
This is the remaster, yeah.

2959
03:08:25,950 --> 03:08:26,350
Does it?

2960
03:08:26,590 --> 03:08:31,870
I mean, I imagine the remaster looks better than the
original, no?

2961
03:08:31,970 --> 03:08:33,250
Is it that difficult to tell?

2962
03:08:33,990 --> 03:08:36,930
Because I've had several people asking, like, is this the
remaster or not?

2963
03:08:39,330 --> 03:08:40,210
Alan Explorer.

2964
03:08:44,830 --> 03:08:57,210
I can't tell really that's so interesting wait okay never
mind that's a collapse it's not that different I'd have to

2965
03:08:57,210 --> 03:09:07,830
make my way up this mineshaft in order to go on maybe the
machinery could help me with that okay sure still looks like

2966
03:09:07,830 --> 03:09:10,890
an old game to me I guess that's fair

2967
03:09:23,160 --> 03:09:27,650
There we go.

2968
03:09:28,350 --> 03:09:29,490
That's better maybe.

2969
03:09:34,110 --> 03:09:34,390
Nice.

2970
03:09:35,210 --> 03:09:35,590
Jump!

2971
03:09:36,350 --> 03:09:36,670
Nice.

2972
03:09:37,210 --> 03:09:38,010
Clap.

2973
03:09:41,090 --> 03:09:42,450
Yeah, this is a remaster.

2974
03:09:45,310 --> 03:09:46,510
Alan, jump!

2975
03:09:56,380 --> 03:09:57,460
Hmm.

2976
03:10:00,850 --> 03:10:01,390
Hmm.

2977
03:10:01,950 --> 03:10:02,250
Hmm.

2978
03:10:07,740 --> 03:10:08,140
Wee!

2979
03:10:12,860 --> 03:10:14,560
Prefer that it's a minimal remaster?

2980
03:10:14,900 --> 03:10:15,900
I don't mind it at all either.

2981
03:10:17,460 --> 03:10:18,440
You know, I never played...

2982
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:20,820
Where am I trying to get to?

2983
03:10:21,360 --> 03:10:23,080
I didn't play the original, obviously.

2984
03:10:24,060 --> 03:10:25,860
But I'm still enjoying myself.

2985
03:10:26,200 --> 03:10:26,420
Where?

2986
03:10:28,940 --> 03:10:30,780
I'm trying to get to this platform, no?

2987
03:10:32,320 --> 03:10:35,440
I don't think I can reach it, though, even if I jump.

2988
03:10:45,800 --> 03:10:48,080
A lot of changes in the details and why, then.

2989
03:10:54,440 --> 03:10:55,940
Oh, maybe I go over there.

2990
03:10:56,180 --> 03:10:57,860
Oh, I see what I'm supposed to do.

2991
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:58,600
Okay, no, just kidding.

2992
03:11:02,740 --> 03:11:03,240
There we go.

2993
03:11:03,980 --> 03:11:04,200
Wait!

2994
03:11:05,780 --> 03:11:06,180
Hemp!

2995
03:11:11,820 --> 03:11:13,360
I got it.

2996
03:11:13,880 --> 03:11:14,780
I got it.

2997
03:11:15,420 --> 03:11:16,300
Wait, what's up here, though?

2998
03:11:22,520 --> 03:11:26,580
I played the OG one recently since it was what I had, and
honestly, it doesn't look that much.

2999
03:11:26,600 --> 03:11:27,020
different.

3000
03:11:27,360 --> 03:11:36,240
I already explained before, but this one was free for me,
so, um, that's why I'm playing this one, but, uh, it still

3001
03:11:36,240 --> 03:11:41,140
does not look bad to me at all, or it has, it has played
fine.

3002
03:11:41,580 --> 03:11:44,100
I'm having, I'm enjoying it.

3003
03:11:44,460 --> 03:11:44,700
Okay.

3004
03:11:46,860 --> 03:11:49,660
Let's maneuver this now.

3005
03:11:53,400 --> 03:11:54,380
Oh, easy.

3006
03:11:56,600 --> 03:11:58,580
Free is my favorite price.

3007
03:11:58,820 --> 03:11:59,880
Yeah, baby.

3008
03:12:03,600 --> 03:12:10,240
But I think some people were saying that you can get the
original on Steam for like a few bucks.

3009
03:12:10,940 --> 03:12:13,960
So that's

3010
03:12:17,540 --> 03:12:18,520
always a good deal too.

3011
03:12:24,300 --> 03:12:28,580
I'm usually one to like want to play original versions of a
game.

3012
03:12:31,060 --> 03:12:31,620
But...

3013
03:12:31,640 --> 03:12:33,160
Wait, where did this take me?

3014
03:12:33,420 --> 03:12:33,540
Wait.

3015
03:12:43,700 --> 03:12:45,020
So we got up here.

3016
03:12:46,800 --> 03:12:48,300
Oh, I see, I see, I see.

3017
03:12:48,520 --> 03:12:49,140
Oh, okay, okay.

3018
03:12:49,520 --> 03:12:50,600
That's where we need to go.

3019
03:12:52,900 --> 03:12:53,260
Hempf.

3020
03:12:53,380 --> 03:12:53,780
There we go.

3021
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:57,720
I believe two is only on Epic.

3022
03:12:59,100 --> 03:13:01,340
And I think when I got the first one...

3023
03:13:03,080 --> 03:13:03,580
Or not...

3024
03:13:03,580 --> 03:13:05,360
Sorry, when I bought two...

3025
03:13:05,980 --> 03:13:07,420
It gave me one for free.

3026
03:13:07,480 --> 03:13:08,680
Or maybe they were both free.

3027
03:13:08,780 --> 03:13:09,220
I don't know.

3028
03:13:09,340 --> 03:13:11,640
I feel like I got it for like some special deal.

3029
03:13:12,760 --> 03:13:13,620
Alan humph.

3030
03:13:14,380 --> 03:13:15,340
He got a lot.

3031
03:13:15,440 --> 03:13:16,600
He got that humph in him.

3032
03:13:18,240 --> 03:13:18,480
Like.

3033
03:13:19,660 --> 03:13:20,040
Yay.

3034
03:13:20,720 --> 03:13:21,240
Checkpoint.

3035
03:13:23,460 --> 03:13:24,780
Am I out of the mines?

3036
03:13:27,840 --> 03:13:29,680
Oh, I think we actually are.

3037
03:13:30,420 --> 03:13:31,320
Let's go.

3038
03:13:32,800 --> 03:13:33,260
Oh, kick.

3039
03:13:33,880 --> 03:13:34,840
Alan kick.

3040
03:13:38,270 --> 03:13:38,790
Yeah.

3041
03:13:39,090 --> 03:13:39,610
Yeah.

3042
03:13:41,170 --> 03:13:42,690
Reach the peak.

3043
03:13:44,810 --> 03:13:45,750
It's peak, everybody.

3044
03:13:45,970 --> 03:13:46,410
It's peak.

3045
03:13:46,590 --> 03:13:47,390
What's down here?

3046
03:13:48,410 --> 03:13:49,310
Alan Explore.

3047
03:13:52,050 --> 03:13:55,390
Actually, I think the peak might be over there, so hold on.

3048
03:13:59,150 --> 03:14:01,930
Oh, what just happened?

3049
03:14:04,930 --> 03:14:05,270
Hello?

3050
03:14:06,170 --> 03:14:10,290
That was weird.

3051
03:14:11,210 --> 03:14:11,650
Alan?

3052
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:19,270
Alan, you got some weird stuff going on.

3053
03:14:21,130 --> 03:14:22,310
That was bizarre.

3054
03:14:23,390 --> 03:14:24,370
I'm not gonna lie.

3055
03:14:29,010 --> 03:14:30,370
Oh, this is a visual.

3056
03:14:30,430 --> 03:14:34,630
Oh my gosh, I'm getting a lot of the visual glitches today
though.

3057
03:14:37,850 --> 03:14:38,510
I focus.

3058
03:14:45,150 --> 03:14:45,590
Wow.

3059
03:14:45,990 --> 03:14:46,890
What am I looking?

3060
03:14:47,030 --> 03:14:48,570
Is that the peak right there?

3061
03:14:48,750 --> 03:14:56,250
The little, little like point that looks like it's Pride
Rock.

3062
03:14:57,630 --> 03:14:58,890
The Yudukab.

3063
03:15:07,870 --> 03:15:10,310
Tor hits Nurse Sinclair.

3064
03:15:10,530 --> 03:15:13,310
Lightning flash behind the windows of Calderon Lake Lodge.

3065
03:15:13,890 --> 03:15:16,710
Tor Anderson laughed and held the stealing number above his
head.

3066
03:15:16,890 --> 03:15:17,250
Uh oh.

3067
03:15:17,470 --> 03:15:18,730
Nurse Sinclair was trying to come in.

3068
03:15:18,750 --> 03:15:26,730
him down without success tour grinned madly and shouted my
hammer's up here's a friendly poke from molnir wench oh my

3069
03:15:26,730 --> 03:15:40,370

on a comeback tour baby oh that doesn't sound good oh boy i

3070
03:15:40,370 --> 03:15:41,700
like how dramatic this is

3071
03:15:51,660 --> 03:15:54,060
just seem a little...

3072
03:15:55,080 --> 03:16:02,300
Like, so big, you know, your problems are so small compared
to how the world is, the size of the world.

3073
03:16:04,040 --> 03:16:04,980
Anything else over here?

3074
03:16:05,220 --> 03:16:05,440
Nothing?

3075
03:16:06,200 --> 03:16:06,200
Okay.

3076
03:16:09,430 --> 03:16:12,660
That was a nice little detour as well.

3077
03:16:15,860 --> 03:16:17,860
Reach the mirror peak lookout.

3078
03:16:18,460 --> 03:16:20,260
Surely, I'm not gonna have another issue.

3079
03:16:21,660 --> 03:16:23,420
like at lover's peak.

3080
03:16:25,200 --> 03:16:25,480
Right?

3081
03:16:26,900 --> 03:16:27,940
Please, God, no.

3082
03:16:28,480 --> 03:16:30,040
I don't want to go through it again.

3083
03:16:31,860 --> 03:16:32,820
Oh, the bird, you're right.

3084
03:16:39,580 --> 03:16:41,420
Yeah, I'm taking out these birds.

3085
03:16:42,380 --> 03:16:42,740
Oh!

3086
03:16:43,940 --> 03:16:46,500
You guys are going to be extinct by the time!

3087
03:16:49,490 --> 03:16:51,250
Oh, it's the bird music again.

3088
03:16:52,430 --> 03:16:55,430
Bird, bird.

3089
03:16:55,450 --> 03:16:56,490
Bird, bird, it's happening.

3090
03:17:04,130 --> 03:17:05,730
And there they go, yep.

3091
03:17:06,610 --> 03:17:07,810
As fast as they can.

3092
03:17:12,210 --> 03:17:13,250
More flares!

3093
03:17:13,750 --> 03:17:13,850
Oh.

3094
03:17:14,410 --> 03:17:18,130
Oh, you're right.

3095
03:17:18,370 --> 03:17:19,530
I didn't even think about it.

3096
03:17:19,650 --> 03:17:20,370
Oh, great.

3097
03:17:20,510 --> 03:17:21,190
You're so right.

3098
03:17:21,650 --> 03:17:22,390
Oh, great.

3099
03:17:23,270 --> 03:17:24,550
This one will go better.

3100
03:17:24,670 --> 03:17:26,530
These are so unsafe.

3101
03:17:27,030 --> 03:17:31,310
Like, everything in this game is an OSHA...

3102
03:17:31,710 --> 03:17:33,350
Nightmare, I fear.

3103
03:17:38,150 --> 03:17:39,070
Where are they?

3104
03:17:39,650 --> 03:17:39,790
Oh!

3105
03:17:44,820 --> 03:17:45,920
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

3106
03:17:50,160 --> 03:17:51,320
They're aggressive.

3107
03:17:52,500 --> 03:17:52,740
Look!

3108
03:17:53,340 --> 03:17:53,900
Oh my god!

3109
03:17:56,740 --> 03:18:00,780
I wish I could turn around faster to kill these guys.

3110
03:18:01,680 --> 03:18:02,200
Oh my god.

3111
03:18:02,980 --> 03:18:03,480
Almost

3112
03:18:18,700 --> 03:18:19,600
there maybe?

3113
03:18:21,640 --> 03:18:22,440
Flare him.

3114
03:18:43,240 --> 03:18:46,260
Oh my god, it's just one thing after another.

3115
03:18:46,600 --> 03:18:48,380
Oh my god, it's just one thing after another!

3116
03:18:50,420 --> 03:18:50,920
Oh.

3117
03:18:56,670 --> 03:19:00,010
I did not mean to do that, but it was awesome!

3118
03:19:02,370 --> 03:19:03,370
I did

3119
03:19:08,190 --> 03:19:09,270
not mean to use that.

3120
03:19:09,530 --> 03:19:14,330
It was just automatically equipped because I had a...

3121
03:19:18,470 --> 03:19:20,950
I could get around that.

3122
03:19:21,130 --> 03:19:21,990
We're fine.

3123
03:19:25,410 --> 03:19:26,350
You see?

3124
03:19:28,930 --> 03:19:30,610
Cinema indeed.

3125
03:19:33,790 --> 03:19:35,070
Oh, we don't even need more revolvers.

3126
03:19:36,290 --> 03:19:38,930
Was there anything up here?

3127
03:19:40,690 --> 03:19:41,110
Hey.

3128
03:19:47,110 --> 03:19:48,210
All right.

3129
03:19:49,630 --> 03:19:50,170
Oh.

3130
03:19:50,490 --> 03:19:50,870
Oh.

3131
03:19:50,890 --> 03:19:52,530
Ambush here?

3132
03:19:53,550 --> 03:19:54,010
I

3133
03:19:59,310 --> 03:20:00,270
don't even know where I'm going.

3134
03:20:02,410 --> 03:20:04,430
I know where I'm going but I don't know.

3135
03:20:06,430 --> 03:20:07,390
Where are you guys?

3136
03:20:07,990 --> 03:20:08,590
Where are you?

3137
03:20:09,530 --> 03:20:10,290
Where are you?

3138
03:20:10,890 --> 03:20:12,170
What is this?

3139
03:20:12,830 --> 03:20:14,230
What is this formation here?

3140
03:20:14,710 --> 03:20:16,410
Oh there's something here though.

3141
03:20:16,810 --> 03:20:19,790
I'll take that for sure.

3142
03:20:20,870 --> 03:20:21,470
Ah there they are.

3143
03:20:39,610 --> 03:20:40,210
Sir?

3144
03:20:46,020 --> 03:20:47,660
I love the hunting rifle.

3145
03:20:48,920 --> 03:20:49,400
What?

3146
03:20:59,540 --> 03:21:00,120
Yeah.

3147
03:21:02,960 --> 03:21:05,200
I like the hunting rifle, I think.

3148
03:21:07,600 --> 03:21:09,560
Uh, is this not a light right here?

3149
03:21:11,020 --> 03:21:12,140
Oh, damn!

3150
03:21:12,640 --> 03:21:13,680
Oh, my God.

3151
03:21:15,500 --> 03:21:16,220
Anyway.

3152
03:21:18,140 --> 03:21:18,420
Come.

3153
03:21:23,360 --> 03:21:25,620
What did he throw at me?

3154
03:21:30,860 --> 03:21:32,880
Uh, cauldron lake!

3155
03:21:33,980 --> 03:21:34,380
Okay.

3156
03:21:35,400 --> 03:21:36,540
You're not gonna be behind me, are you?

3157
03:21:40,560 --> 03:21:41,680
Checkpoint reached!

3158
03:21:42,880 --> 03:21:43,140
Oh.

3159
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:45,980
This looks kind of precarious now, don't it?

3160
03:21:47,440 --> 03:21:48,140
Oh, geez.

3161
03:21:49,120 --> 03:21:49,760
Okay, come on.

3162
03:21:51,200 --> 03:21:53,960
Nothing, just one step at a time.

3163
03:21:54,780 --> 03:21:55,420
Easy does it.

3164
03:21:59,700 --> 03:22:02,300
This Oshi body pillow, that's what it choked at me.

3165
03:22:03,740 --> 03:22:04,880
It's not the birds, is it?

3166
03:22:05,100 --> 03:22:06,960
Oh no, it's just a bunch of guys.

3167
03:22:07,440 --> 03:22:08,380
Oh, I'm so screwed.

3168
03:22:08,720 --> 03:22:11,120
Wait, uh, how are y'all?

3169
03:22:12,380 --> 03:22:14,320
Oh my god, the guy is like right behind me.

3170
03:22:24,610 --> 03:22:27,890
I don't mean to use flares, but honestly, it's fine.

3171
03:22:28,950 --> 03:22:30,050
whatever works, I suppose.

3172
03:22:37,020 --> 03:22:37,900
Oh, I didn't shoot him.

3173
03:22:38,160 --> 03:22:40,000
Oh, oh, big guy.

3174
03:22:40,240 --> 03:22:41,780
Oh, wait, I'm gonna fall off!

3175
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:47,750
Big guy.

3176
03:22:48,790 --> 03:22:49,290
Oh, shoot.

3177
03:22:53,510 --> 03:22:54,810
Oh my God.

3178
03:22:55,210 --> 03:22:55,610
Oh, awkward.

3179
03:23:00,360 --> 03:23:00,660
Ouch!

3180
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:03,100
Where are you?

3181
03:23:04,320 --> 03:23:04,660
Okay.

3182
03:23:06,100 --> 03:23:07,040
Oh, holy.

3183
03:23:07,360 --> 03:23:08,840
Yeah, I do have them, that's true.

3184
03:23:09,200 --> 03:23:10,700
Use them while I got them, huh?

3185
03:23:11,100 --> 03:23:13,660
I guess I only have two flash...

3186
03:23:13,660 --> 03:23:14,500
Uh...

3187
03:23:14,500 --> 03:23:15,580
Two flashbangs, so...

3188
03:23:15,580 --> 03:23:15,740
Oh.

3189
03:23:16,880 --> 03:23:17,100
Oh.

3190
03:23:17,980 --> 03:23:18,580
Where?

3191
03:23:18,960 --> 03:23:19,780
This way?

3192
03:23:20,200 --> 03:23:20,480
Where?

3193
03:23:21,420 --> 03:23:21,800
Where?

3194
03:23:21,940 --> 03:23:22,600
Oh, over there?

3195
03:23:22,960 --> 03:23:23,280
Okay.

3196
03:23:23,420 --> 03:23:23,900
Thank you.

3197
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:26,060
Oh, woo.

3198
03:23:27,220 --> 03:23:28,360
Thank you.

3199
03:23:30,760 --> 03:23:32,980
They're going and more and more and more and more.

3200
03:23:37,970 --> 03:23:38,570
Okay.

3201
03:23:39,290 --> 03:23:39,850
Alright.

3202
03:23:40,270 --> 03:23:41,170
We're going up.

3203
03:23:41,810 --> 03:23:42,470
We're going up.

3204
03:23:45,550 --> 03:23:46,590
This way.

3205
03:23:47,590 --> 03:23:47,810
Okay.

3206
03:23:50,570 --> 03:23:51,090
This...

3207
03:23:51,090 --> 03:23:51,990
This way.

3208
03:23:53,430 --> 03:23:56,350
I'm telling you, man, this place is so...

3209
03:23:56,350 --> 03:23:58,230
Everything is so run down.

3210
03:23:59,450 --> 03:24:00,410
Like, who...

3211
03:24:01,330 --> 03:24:03,450
A child is gonna die here.

3212
03:24:04,750 --> 03:24:06,190
Some kid's life, little...

3213
03:24:06,190 --> 03:24:12,050
Little, like, kid life mission is gonna be like, I wanna go
to the mining town, and they'll get there.

3214
03:24:12,490 --> 03:24:14,730
Mott had checked all of Stucky's rental cabins.

3215
03:24:14,830 --> 03:24:15,350
Where's Mott?

3216
03:24:15,530 --> 03:24:16,810
There had been no sign of the wakes.

3217
03:24:17,550 --> 03:24:21,010
It was dark when he'd found their car parked at the end of
the road by Cauldron Lake.

3218
03:24:21,610 --> 03:24:22,370
It made no sense.

3219
03:24:23,010 --> 03:24:24,430
They must have taken a wrong turn.

3220
03:24:25,010 --> 03:24:26,030
But there was no sign of them.

3221
03:24:26,470 --> 03:24:28,490
And the car had been there for hours already.

3222
03:24:29,410 --> 03:24:29,690
Frustrated.

3223
03:24:30,130 --> 03:24:35,050
Mott stood on the rotten ruin of the footbridge that had
once led to Diver's Isle before it sank beneath the waves

3224
03:24:35,050 --> 03:24:35,630
years ago.

3225
03:24:36,350 --> 03:24:37,610
The boss wouldn't be happy.

3226
03:24:37,810 --> 03:24:39,130
Timmy's stuck in the mines.

3227
03:24:41,170 --> 03:24:41,570
Like...

3228
03:24:41,570 --> 03:24:45,950
I really think I missed two pages.

3229
03:24:46,390 --> 03:24:47,650
No, how could I?

3230
03:24:48,370 --> 03:24:49,670
Dang it.

3231
03:24:52,940 --> 03:24:53,880
All right.

3232
03:24:55,240 --> 03:24:57,580
Shirley, we're almost to the peak.

3233
03:24:59,060 --> 03:25:00,980
Cross the mountain ruins.

3234
03:25:01,700 --> 03:25:03,340
Is that what this is now?

3235
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:06,540
Whoa!

3236
03:25:07,720 --> 03:25:08,560
What is here?

3237
03:25:11,160 --> 03:25:11,560
Jump.

3238
03:25:12,100 --> 03:25:12,680
Alan, jump.

3239
03:25:13,800 --> 03:25:14,420
and push.

3240
03:25:14,840 --> 03:25:14,840
Oh!

3241
03:25:15,480 --> 03:25:16,080
Actually.

3242
03:25:17,340 --> 03:25:20,020
Wait, what's over here before we go too far?

3243
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:25,720
The boss fight I skipped?

3244
03:25:25,880 --> 03:25:26,580
Oh, you think?

3245
03:25:26,680 --> 03:25:27,060
Maybe.

3246
03:25:28,180 --> 03:25:30,280
Maybe there was, like, one in there.

3247
03:25:33,380 --> 03:25:33,860
Alright.

3248
03:25:36,080 --> 03:25:38,840
It's not that I wanted to skip it.

3249
03:25:38,960 --> 03:25:40,500
It's just that it was skippable.

3250
03:25:41,720 --> 03:25:43,420
I think there's a difference.

3251
03:25:44,500 --> 03:25:45,100
Whoa!

3252
03:25:45,260 --> 03:25:45,880
Whoa!

3253
03:25:48,200 --> 03:25:50,000
Whoa, I like looking at the view.

3254
03:25:50,260 --> 03:25:51,540
This game is so cool looking.

3255
03:25:55,670 --> 03:25:56,930
Do I need to go in there?

3256
03:25:57,650 --> 03:25:59,110
I heard a pigeon.

3257
03:26:06,990 --> 03:26:08,990
I'll come back for you.

3258
03:26:13,420 --> 03:26:13,980
Wait.

3259
03:26:15,300 --> 03:26:15,580
Oh.

3260
03:26:18,460 --> 03:26:19,020
Oh.

3261
03:26:20,940 --> 03:26:21,400
Jump.

3262
03:26:22,080 --> 03:26:22,480
Oh no.

3263
03:26:23,520 --> 03:26:30,460
in my bed oh shoot come on game i didn't even get to check
if the front door was open i guess not

3264
03:26:37,130 --> 03:26:43,110
cw and tz tom and tom

3265
03:26:46,390 --> 03:26:50,010

3266
03:26:54,340 --> 03:26:59,740
you talk to me on tv I miss you, Tom.

3267
03:27:00,460 --> 03:27:01,360
Did you write this?

3268
03:27:01,720 --> 03:27:04,100
Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.

3269
03:27:05,620 --> 03:27:11,700
Oh, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom,
Tom, Tom.

3270
03:27:11,720 --> 03:27:12,680
I miss you, Tom.

3271
03:27:15,600 --> 03:27:18,340
I think someone's got a little crush on Tom.

3272
03:27:19,240 --> 03:27:20,180
Wait, there was something out.

3273
03:27:20,260 --> 03:27:21,480
Oh, you talked to me on TV.

3274
03:27:22,780 --> 03:27:23,620
I miss you, Tom.

3275
03:27:23,880 --> 03:27:24,000
Tom.

3276
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:30,880
I think somebody's got a little crush.

3277
03:27:34,540 --> 03:27:36,540
Oh, this feels like horror for real now.

3278
03:27:36,720 --> 03:27:37,880
We're in, like, such a creepy building.

3279
03:27:43,600 --> 03:27:44,240
Revolver.

3280
03:27:45,720 --> 03:27:48,000
Uh, any green apple.

3281
03:27:48,460 --> 03:27:49,260
Over there.

3282
03:27:50,340 --> 03:27:52,660
I think the other one was shotgun, too.

3283
03:27:53,340 --> 03:27:53,980
Okay.

3284
03:27:56,060 --> 03:27:57,360
Don't like that!

3285
03:27:57,660 --> 03:28:01,340
Okay, if these are ruins, how truly old are they?

3286
03:28:01,600 --> 03:28:06,320
Like, it doesn't seem like such a old building.

3287
03:28:07,680 --> 03:28:08,460
Like, there's a lamp.

3288
03:28:11,960 --> 03:28:12,580
70s.

3289
03:28:13,620 --> 03:28:18,480
I feel like ruins belong for, like, something from the BC
era.

3290
03:28:19,680 --> 03:28:21,300
8,000 years old.

3291
03:28:21,420 --> 03:28:21,780
Yeah.

3292
03:28:28,380 --> 03:28:28,900
Hello?

3293
03:28:30,360 --> 03:28:30,960
Not hello.

3294
03:28:31,220 --> 03:28:32,440
There should be nobody here.

3295
03:28:33,920 --> 03:28:34,300
Oh, jeez.

3296
03:28:41,560 --> 03:28:42,340
And flare.

3297
03:28:50,850 --> 03:28:51,610
Oh, jeez.

3298
03:28:51,790 --> 03:28:52,190
Another flare.

3299
03:28:55,350 --> 03:28:57,050
Oh, I should kill you first.

3300
03:29:17,910 --> 03:29:18,430
Yeah, yeah.

3301
03:29:18,630 --> 03:29:19,470
Stay away from me.

3302
03:29:22,010 --> 03:29:22,770
Stay away from me!

3303
03:29:23,290 --> 03:29:24,010
The corner strat.

3304
03:29:24,230 --> 03:29:26,010
The corner strat!

3305
03:29:26,610 --> 03:29:27,170
It's effective!

3306
03:29:31,140 --> 03:29:33,340
Oh, that's another big guy I just realized.

3307
03:29:35,340 --> 03:29:35,940
Oh, there's more?

3308
03:29:36,920 --> 03:29:37,620
Corner strat.

3309
03:29:39,040 --> 03:29:39,920
Corner strat.

3310
03:29:41,820 --> 03:29:43,160
Oh my god, please.

3311
03:29:43,860 --> 03:29:44,220
No!

3312
03:29:44,800 --> 03:29:45,880
Why are you smart?

3313
03:29:47,620 --> 03:29:49,460
I just realized.

3314
03:30:00,870 --> 03:30:01,630
Ouch!

3315
03:30:03,050 --> 03:30:03,810
Yeah!

3316
03:30:06,150 --> 03:30:07,370
I'm gonna get you.

3317
03:30:09,470 --> 03:30:10,090
And one more.

3318
03:30:10,710 --> 03:30:11,490
Yeah, okay.

3319
03:30:11,710 --> 03:30:12,770
Just one guy left now.

3320
03:30:13,470 --> 03:30:14,170
Okay, we're good.

3321
03:30:17,500 --> 03:30:20,460
I could have used my flare gun, but...

3322
03:30:20,460 --> 03:30:22,040
Oh, I have one bullet left.

3323
03:30:22,700 --> 03:30:23,000
Nice.

3324
03:30:25,260 --> 03:30:26,080
I panicked.

3325
03:30:28,700 --> 03:30:29,760
Plain and simple.

3326
03:30:30,960 --> 03:30:31,560
I was scared.

3327
03:30:31,960 --> 03:30:33,360
And I forgot to switch weapons.

3328
03:30:38,440 --> 03:30:38,860
Okay.

3329
03:30:43,160 --> 03:30:43,940
They're here?

3330
03:30:44,420 --> 03:30:45,080
Oh, yeah.

3331
03:30:46,280 --> 03:30:46,720
Alright.

3332
03:30:47,120 --> 03:30:49,020
I should switch weapons now, though.

3333
03:30:49,640 --> 03:30:50,080
Let's do it.

3334
03:30:50,600 --> 03:30:51,100
Humpf.

3335
03:30:51,220 --> 03:30:51,900
Alan Humpf.

3336
03:30:53,980 --> 03:30:54,520
And the thermos.

3337
03:30:56,620 --> 03:30:58,200
One bullet left.

3338
03:30:59,620 --> 03:31:00,820
Why would they do this to me?

3339
03:31:01,860 --> 03:31:03,580
They're like, you're too good on that gun.

3340
03:31:08,120 --> 03:31:09,600
You're too good at this game.

3341

The boss didn't know who he was messing with!

03:32:52,000 --> 03:32:52,760
I didn't know!

3357
03:32:53,020 --> 03:32:54,480
I swear, I didn't know!

3358
03:32:57,750 --> 03:32:59,010
We don't know who she is!

3359
03:32:59,050 --> 03:33:00,490
She's probably grown!

3360
03:33:01,250 --> 03:33:03,330
Who just said we had her make a play ball?

3361
03:33:03,550 --> 03:33:04,170

I don't know if he's doing so good, you guys.

3367
03:33:25,570 --> 03:33:25,630
Oh.

3368
03:33:29,320 --> 03:33:29,820
Hello.

3369
03:33:34,260 --> 03:33:35,380
Hey, stupid.

3370
03:33:35,640 --> 03:33:36,400
Where's my wife?

3371
03:33:37,140 --> 03:33:38,680
That you said you don't have her?

3372
03:33:38,940 --> 03:33:40,340
Oh my god, grandma.

3373
03:33:40,520 --> 03:33:41,620
Grandma, jump scare.

3374
03:33:47,840 --> 03:33:50,140
It looks like a wizard of eyes.

3375
03:33:51,180 --> 03:33:51,680
Okay.

3376
03:34:10,550 --> 03:34:13,530
Wow, the smolder.

3377
03:34:14,490 --> 03:34:15,130
Oh,

3378
03:34:19,760 --> 03:34:21,420
someone was grabbing his wife.

3379
03:34:22,000 --> 03:34:22,740
Grabbing Alice.

3380
03:34:29,150 --> 03:34:30,390
Alan waken the lake.

3381
03:34:36,020 --> 03:34:36,420
Dead space?

3382
03:34:36,840 --> 03:34:37,960
Well, not dead space.

3383
03:34:38,280 --> 03:34:38,820
Uh, Bioshock?

3384
03:34:39,140 --> 03:34:39,700
Oh my gosh.

3385
03:34:39,900 --> 03:34:40,140
What?

3386
03:34:40,380 --> 03:34:40,580
What?

3387
03:34:48,670 --> 03:34:51,430
Oh wow, end of episode 3!

3388
03:34:55,160 --> 03:34:57,300
Big Daddy, yeah.

3389
03:34:57,520 --> 03:34:59,300
Alright, I'm gonna skip it because...

3390
03:34:59,300 --> 03:35:02,040
Sorry, I keep getting DMCA'd by this game.

3391
03:35:03,320 --> 03:35:07,080
Are you seriously telling me that writer just took out my
deputies?

3392
03:35:07,300 --> 03:35:09,760
A thriller I supposedly wrote is coming true.

3393
03:35:10,180 --> 03:35:12,300
The genre of the story seems to be shifting.

3394
03:35:13,220 --> 03:35:14,680
It's turning into a horror story.

3395
03:35:16,360 --> 03:35:18,320
But that was a lie.

3396
03:35:18,320 --> 03:35:19,880
We don't have his wife.

3397
03:35:20,460 --> 03:35:21,720
We don't know where she is.

3398
03:35:21,760 --> 03:35:25,780
Our purported kidnapper was eaten up by the dark presence
before it attacked me.

3399
03:35:25,940 --> 03:35:32,320
Episode 4, the truth!

3400
03:35:34,460 --> 03:35:35,880
We'll watch this before.

3401
03:35:36,300 --> 03:35:37,640
It was just a nightmare.

3402
03:35:38,360 --> 03:35:38,920
Alice.

3403
03:35:40,740 --> 03:35:42,240
There you go, Alan.

3404
03:35:42,900 --> 03:35:43,460
Hartman.

3405
03:35:43,980 --> 03:35:44,500
I fell.

3406
03:35:44,680 --> 03:35:46,300
I had to give you a set attack.

3407
03:35:46,320 --> 03:35:54,540
don't fight it you went through another rough period what
right now it's very important that you stay calm we don't

3408
03:35:54,540 --> 03:36:02,000
want you to have another episode you're a patient at my
clinic have been for a while now the shock of your wife's

3409
03:36:02,000 --> 03:36:08,400
death triggered a mental illness no you're you lie you're
suffering from various symptoms of undifferentiated

3410
03:36:08,400 --> 03:36:17,440

Alice!

3411
03:36:18,480 --> 03:36:18,760
No!

3412
03:36:22,060 --> 03:36:23,740
Alan, wake in the lodge.

3413
03:36:30,340 --> 03:36:31,680
It's been nine years.

3414
03:36:32,880 --> 03:36:34,140
I felt groggy.

3415
03:36:34,920 --> 03:36:37,440
Whatever Hartman had bumped in me was making me numb.

3416
03:36:38,180 --> 03:36:40,040
I felt like this was happening to someone else.

3417
03:36:40,540 --> 03:36:41,940
Someone I was watching on television.

3418
03:36:42,620 --> 03:36:43,320
I couldn't think.

3419
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:44,840
I couldn't focus.

3420
03:36:45,860 --> 03:36:47,980
I become so numb.

3421
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:53,600

Well, guys, thank you so much for Alan Wake, episode 3.

But boy, golly, did that one drag on.

3428

Holy cow.

3429
03:37:44,980 --> 03:37:48,780
I felt like it was just one trip in after it was like, one
thing.

3430
03:37:48,980 --> 03:37:50,020
It was so long.

3431

I'm just like, where did we?

3432
03:37:50,960 --> 03:37:54,000
We started at the trailer park and then the FBI.

3433
03:37:54,540 --> 03:37:57,780
And then we were running from literally everything.

3434
03:37:59,420 --> 03:38:00,860
