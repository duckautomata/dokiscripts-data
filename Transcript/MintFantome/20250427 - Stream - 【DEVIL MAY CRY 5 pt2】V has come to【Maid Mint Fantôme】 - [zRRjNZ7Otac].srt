1
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:41,580
Woo... Woo... Woo... Woo...

2
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,700
Five!

3
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,480
Yippee!

4
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,300
Hello, hello, hello!

5
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,340
Everybody!

6
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,780
Welcome back to Devil May Cry!

7
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,960
Hello, hello, hello!

8
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,560
Hello, hello, hello!

9
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,900
Yes, today, I'm back.

10
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,500
Last week, I did not play so much of Devil May Cry 5.

11
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,000
But today, I would like to play more.

12
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,600
How it goes.

13
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,680
You mentioned watching...

14
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh, hold on.

15
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,720
Wait, what's happening?

16
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,020
Wait, why is it so fast?

17
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,740
Why is it so soon?

18
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,000
IGN has a great series of devs watching speedruns.

19
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,400
That includes 5 and Portal.

20
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
Or, uh, DMC5 and Portal.

21
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:28,820
Woo!

22
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,880
I...

23
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,440
Saw something like that.

24
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,240
I don't remember which game it was.

25
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,920
Where the devs were watching someone...

26
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,400
It was like, just the other day that I saw it too.

27
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,800
But yeah.

28
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,320
So...

29
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,180
That's all.

30
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,180
2B's Brian, welcome back!

31
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,020
Oh, there's a Mento's running through my head!

32
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,700
Barley, welcome back!

33
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,400
Thank you, Yuni!

34
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,700
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

35
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,960
Thank you!

36
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,380
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

37
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,200
Thank you!

38
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,560
And Nicholas, welcome back!

39
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,100
From C to SS, how was your day?

40
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:07,520
Oh!

41
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,400
Oh, are we super stylish today?

42
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,660
I don't think I'm ever super stylish any day.

43
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,020
Or sexy smokey...

44
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,420
Stop!

45
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,040
Oh my god!

46
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:18,720
Go!

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,200
Stop!

48
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,060
Stop!

49
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,660
Let me speak, please!

50
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,140
Yay!

51
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,380
D and SSS not included.

52
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,740
Now...

53
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,520
No D!

54
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,040
No D!

55
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,320
No D!

56
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,300
Uh...

57
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,540
Today...

58
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,200
Today...

59
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,480
I...

60
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,380
I think I'm A for awesome.

61
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:46,820
Probably.

62
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,060
Yeah, probably.

63
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,960
My birthday was two days ago.

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,300
I wanted a wish, but my bank froze my account!

65
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,800
Green bear, are you okay?

66
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,100
You don't have to send the super chat.

67
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,680
But happy birthday!

68
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,760
Let's just pretend it's two days ago.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,840
Happy, happy birthday, green bear!

70
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,780
Yeah!

71
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,800
Yeah!

72
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,700
Um...

73
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,960
Yeah, I didn't stream yesterday.

74
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,420
Oh, yesterday was my birthday!

75
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,540
Spice night!

76
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,320
Happy birthday!

77
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:16,780
I re...

78
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,440
Wait, oh gosh.

79
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:17,980
Hold on.

80
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,980
Oh, there we go.

81
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,020
I request your best...

82
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,620
G...

83
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,120
Stare with your cat eyes.

84
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,540
Oh.

85
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,980
Sure, I could try.

86
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,180
G...

87
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,520
G...

88
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,380
G...

89
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,380
G...

90
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:48,660
G...

91
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,820
Yeah, happy birthday!

92
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,580
Spice night!

93
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,220
Happy birthday!

94
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,180
Wacky Wahoo Pizza Fun!

95
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,020
Thank you!

96
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,860
I just arrived in Japan yesterday.

97
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,860
Have fun, Vijay!

98
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,420
Oh!

99
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,900
Good luck, Vijay!

100
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,480
Participating in a big card game tournament.

101
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,240
Let's go!

102
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,740
Um...

103
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,380
I'm gonna...

104
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,180
Practice...

105
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:16,820
In...

106
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,220
The...

107
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,320
Void...

108
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,260
Before we...

109
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,320
Get into...

110
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,000
The game.

111
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,640
Because I...

112
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,180
Want...

113
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,600
We only are on mission 3.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,180
I need to...

115
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,140
Remember how to play the game.

116
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,830
Last time we...

117
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,240
Beat up that big guy boss.

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:35,840
Oh.

119
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,760
I think we should split into two groups.

120
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,240
And cover more ground.

121
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,900
Good idea.

122
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,180
Oh!

123
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,480
Thank you for the raid!

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,360
I'm sorry I didn't see who.

125
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,060
Thank you.

126
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,740
Cash first.

127
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,220
All the materials I collected for your little...

128
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,380
Oh, we watched this one last time.

129
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,020
But that's okay.

130
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,800
My brilliant badass work is worth every dime.

131
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,540
And you know it.

132
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,180
Well, your quality control sucks ass.

133
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,980
And you know that.

134
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,580
Or maybe don't let the demon smack you around so much.

135
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,260
Whatever.

136
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,800
She makes a double cry.

137
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,540
Five.

138
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,260
Five.

139
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,360
Thank you.

140
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,100
I am truly gifted.

141
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,700
It's a work of art.

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a work of art.

143
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,660
Oh, so you're an artist now, huh?

144
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,500
Yes I am.

145
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,720
Got any questions with chicken?

146
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,400
I like her.

147
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,680
She's so snappy.

148
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,500
My grandmother...

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,200
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted.

150
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,860
She's her freckles are so stinking cute.

151
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,540
Yeah!

152
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,540
Cook that bird!

153
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,380
Cook that bird!

154
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,500
Any more questions?

155
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,680
Huh?

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Little cheeky?

157
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,520
V.

158
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,060
I'll take my leave now.

159
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,100
Who is this old man on her?

160
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,760
As a tattoo?

161
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,840
I'll see you at the bottom of the Klyphoth.

162
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:06,920
Klyphoth.

163
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,820
This is the hardest word to say ever.

164
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,060
That's the real reason he's a villain.

165
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,080
I gotta shake the cobwebs out.

166
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,600
I'll let you know.

167
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,920
Hey, you got any more questions?

168
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,160
Better ask it now.

169
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,480
I can't read minds.

170
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,060
Ooh, well, yeah.

171
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,220
Yeah, we got our new arms.

172
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,660
That's right.

173
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,420
We got our new arms!

174
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:32,800
Okay.

175
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,540
Let's go to customize.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,580
Because I got new arms.

177
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,880
I need to go into the void.

178
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,720
And I need to remember how to use things.

179
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:47,780
So...

180
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,740
Wait.

181
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Um...

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,960
Let's just, uh...

183
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,400
Let's just...

184
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,940
Try.

185
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,840
Let's just try and...

186
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,340
It's fine.

187
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,020
Let's just try.

188
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,720
Oh, gosh.

189
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,240
I forgot how ugly the things are in this game.

190
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
Get away from me.

191
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,000
Hold on.

192
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,440
I gotta adjust audio too.

193
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,640
Save for the cover.

194
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,240
Thank you!

195
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,060
Oh.

196
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,500
Okay.

197
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,720
Okay.

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,720
Uh...

199
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,880
And then...

200
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,140
This one?

201
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,480
Okay.

202
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:33,920
Hold on.

203
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,360
Sorry.

204
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,160
Jump time.

205
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,620
Oh, yeah!

206
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,000
Wait.

207
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,240
Oh, no.

208
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,560
Hold on.

209
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,340
Hold on.

210
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:44,660
Hold on.

211
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:44,780
Hold on.

212
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,040
I remember.

213
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:46,680
No, no, no.

214
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,060
Hold on.

215
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,000
Come on!

216
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,720
I can do this!

217
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,100
Right now!

218
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,440
Ah!

219
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,700
We have to...

220
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,460
We got it!

221
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,140
We got it!

222
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,380
We got it!

223
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:02,800
Oh!

224
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,740
The way he sidesteps is too...

225
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:10,620
Wait.

226
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:10,920
Hold on.

227
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,780
I gotta get him in the right...

228
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,480
Ha!

229
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,740
Huh!

230
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,460
Huh!

231
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:19,960
Yeah!

232
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,600
OK.

233
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,520
And then...

234
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,700
For the arms, you can...

235
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,920
Hold down...

236
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:31,960
And...

237
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,800
Oh, wow, that was such a way.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,280
Okay, got it.

239
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:38,900
Cool.

240
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,940
That's the devil trigger dance.

241
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:42,800
Devil trigger.

242
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,360
Bang, bang, bang.

243
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,920
Pull my devil trigger.

244
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,280
Okay, and then this one.

245
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,940
What does it do also?

246
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,300
Okay.

247
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,890
Oh, that's right.

248
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:09,650
It does the push.

249
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,470
It does the push.

250
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:15,490
Oh, I forgot to get the other one though.

251
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:16,210
Hold on.

252
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,270
And then if I...

253
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,710
Yeah.

254
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,770
Oh, and shoot.

255
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,190
Okay.

256
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,230
Oh gosh.

257
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,890
That one is the bomb.

258
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,310
She's the bomb.

259
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,270
Let go of lock on.

260
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,410
Wait, so I shouldn't lock on while I...

261
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,890
There's two different aren't there?

262
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,250
If you... If you...

263
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:58,570
Lock on, and don't lock on.

264
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,070
Yeah, hold B breaks the arm.

265
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,910
Yes, yes, yes.

266
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,430
Hold on, let's see.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,340
Oh, that's right!

268
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,780
And then I can call it back for this one.

269
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,300
And then... Can I ride it?

270
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,300
Or am I crazy?

271
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,040
How do I ride it?

272
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Hold circle?

273
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,560
Oh, I'm on Xbox type controller.

274
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,380
Wait, hold on.

275
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
If I...

276
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,920
Hold B when it's coming back.

277
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,520
Oh, okay.

278
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,080
Okay.

279
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Oh, there we go!

280
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,380
And then...

281
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,220
Oh, hold on.

282
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,220
It's a little tight.

283
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,000
Wait, hold on.

284
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,660
Redo.

285
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,340
Hold on.

286
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,320
Wait, wait.

287
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,940
And then I can do that.

288
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

289
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,460
My friend, Jonathan, is watching while sleepy.

290
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,360
He said he'd go to sleep if you told him to.

291
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,620
Also, it's his birthday.

292
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,340
Jonathan, happy birthday!

293
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,000
Go to sleep.

294
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,580
What are you doing?

295
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,300
If you're sleepy, you should go to sleep.

296
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,740
What the heck are you doing?

297
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:31,920
Hmm?

298
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,340
Hmm?

299
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
Wait, um...

300
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,460
Wait.

301
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,380
Wait, how do I...

302
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,100
Wait, uh...

303
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,780
Wait, hold on.

304
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,980
How long does it last for?

305
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,640
Oh, it just comes back.

306
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,400
Wait.

307
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,960
Does it always just come back?

308
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,240
Oh, it does.

309
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,680
I thought it was gonna break.

310
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,740
Like, how do I...

311
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,020
Oh, is the lock-on the one that's gonna break it?

312
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,440
No?

313
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,260
Let's just call...

314
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,220
Oh, I guess if you skate?

315
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,660
Or...

316
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,820
Oh, this one.

317
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,280
That one will break it.

318
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,920
Got it.

319
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:21,720
So...

320
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,680
Come here.

321
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,640
So this is the push.

322
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,220
The push, push, push.

323
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,540
Okay.

324
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,640
Okay, so it's like...

325
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,000
Come here and push.

326
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:38,980
Come here.

327
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,120
You can like...

328
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,880
You can really play with them here.

329
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,920
You can really...

330
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,820
Lightning Hand does a pretty big chunk of damage.

331
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,740
Look at this guy!

332
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,480
Look at his face!

333
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,280
He's so bloody!

334
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
Are you okay?

335
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,780
You okay?

336
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,780
And then we also...

337
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,080
I can charge my gun now.

338
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:07,650
You okay?

339
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:08,890
Yeah, get up.

340
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,570
Get up, get up, get up.

341
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,470
Okay.

342
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,710
And then...

343
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,350
Let's...

344
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,990
Let's get rid of this one.

345
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,790
Happy birthday!

346
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,050
Now make a win!

347
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,270
Explode...

348
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,520
Helter Skelter...

349
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,670
Is like...

350
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,190
Oh my god!

351
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,430
But if I...

352
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,430
If I hold it down...

353
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,270
Let's do that...

354
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,670
Let's do that...

355
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,880
Okay.

356
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,340
And then Gubra...

357
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,000
Sorry, I'm just trying to remember what each one does.

358
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,480
Whoa!

359
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,420
Whoa!

360
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,520
Whoa!

361
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,170
Can I like...

362
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,160
But I can...

363
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,480
So if I just...

364
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,800
If I don't move, it does that.

365
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,220
But if I'm moving...

366
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,400
I see, I see, I see.

367
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:17,620
Okay.

368
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,980
It's Nero's trickster.

369
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,400
Are you okay immediately?

370
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,320
Slash his face.

371
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,220
And then...

372
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,640
This one...

373
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,880
Oh, this one does the beam!

374
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,800
But it does a...

375
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
It does a different beam in the air, no?

376
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:33,520
Hold on.

377
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:37,900
Yeah!

378
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:38,840
That's right.

379
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,420
Okay.

381
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah.

382
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,060
Crazy.

383
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,900
Crazy, crazy.

384
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,180
Thank you, man, and everyone for the birthday wishes.

385
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,140
I can rest peacefully now, Jonathan.

386
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,500
Goodnight.

387
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,800
Goodnight, goodnight.

388
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,780
Okay.

389
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,460
I think I'm...

390
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,660
Alright to just...

391
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,240
Go.

392
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,100
I'll try.

393
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,340
Nothing...

394
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,880
Nothing better than just getting into the middle of it, you know?

395
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,400
To...

396
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,300
To attempt.

397
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,160
I think I bought everything that...

398
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,740
Wait.

399
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,340
Let's make sure I bought everything.

400
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,040
Skills!

401
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,060
Ah...

402
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,420
I want to wire snatch...

403
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:28,900
Four...

404
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:29,780
Thousand...

405
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,360
Forty thousand.

406
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:32,940
Oh...

407
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,740
Blue Rose...

408
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,860
That's our gun.

409
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,460
Maybe I save for streak too?

410
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,180
I don't remember what I was saving for.

411
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,740
Oh, wait.

412
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,640
Split might be...

413
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:43,960
Oh, wait.

414
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,160
Left stick back.

415
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,400
Wire snatch 40k.

416
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,740
Split is good.

417
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:55,900
Let me...

418
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,380
Let me...

419
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,240
Let me...

420
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,040
Try it.

421
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,140
Let me try it.

422
00:18:59,400 --> 00:18:59,860
I forgot!

423
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,020
We...

424
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,980
We don't get...

425
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,220
We don't get...

426
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,140
Um...

427
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,920
What's the words?

428
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,240
Uh...

429
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,220
Refunge!

430
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,720
I fear that I would probably be like...

431
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,960
You know, like that, but...

432
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,420
Oh...

433
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:28,780
See?

434
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:30,800
Mm...

435
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,340
I'm...

436
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,300
I'm pressing back!

437
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,680
Oh...

438
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:36,780
Oh...

439
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,400
Wait...

440
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,380
Wait...

441
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:38,760
Wait...

442
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,180
Hold on...

443
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,320
Oh...

444
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,120
Hold on...

445
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,280
Oh...

446
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,900
Oh...

447
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,060
That's the one I was thinking of.

448
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,900
Okay, okay...

449
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,020
If I do this...

450
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,040
Oh...

451
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
Wait, can I...

452
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,120
Hold on...

453
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,400
I'm...

454
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,360
Back according to you.

455
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,260
I was...

456
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,100
I was just...

457
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm just...

458
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,080
You know...

459
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,260
Hold on...

460
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,660
Wait...

461
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,420
If I...

462
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:02,780
Wait...

463
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,540
No, hold on...

464
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,940
If I...

465
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,370
Oh...

466
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,870
If I... Aha!

467
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:20,890
Now, see, the thing is, I have to, like, be able to, like, properly execute these things, you know?

468
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,830
Up and down.

469
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,750
Up and down.

470
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,130
I gotta properly execute them.

471
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,450
When I'm not... And also, I make him go so far.

472
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,850
Okay, okay.

473
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,970
So, hold on.

474
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,350
Um... Oh, wait.

475
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,710
Oh, oops.

476
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,790
Wait, okay, hold on, hold on.

477
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:56,450
Come here.

478
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:57,870
Oh, and jump.

479
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,070
Oh, I was late.

480
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,570
I was late.

481
00:20:59,670 --> 00:20:59,950
Hold on.

482
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,750
Oh, but I've sent him flying too far.

483
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,710
Well, I can try it.

484
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,870
Hold Y while the combo?

485
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,450
Hold?

486
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,950
Hold Y when knocking him up.

487
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:19,670
Ew.

488
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:20,730
Ew.

489
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,610
What do you think I'm doing to this guy?

490
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,490
What do you think I'm doing to him?

491
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,990
Oh, that's right!

492
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,590
Oh.

493
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,850
Hey, hey, hold on.

494
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,670
Hold on.

495
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,370
Wait.

496
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,150
Nope.

497
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,760
I will... I will get it, though.

498
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,100
I think I'll still use it.

499
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,220
I will get it.

500
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:55,780
12 months!

501
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,620
How's our gangster ghost fit?

502
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,140
Let me... Okay, I should explain, huh?

503
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,940
Oh my gosh, you guys!

504
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,340
You guys, I...

505
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:15,780
Yesterday, I was like... I was like feeling like I wanted a donut.

506
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,560
You know, I was like, I want a donut!

507
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,760
I don't know.

508
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,380
I just was craving a donut.

509
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,880
And I hadn't had a donut in a while, so I was like, I'm gonna go get a donut.

510
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,180
But I didn't know what kind of donut, so I posted on Twitter.

511
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,180
I was like, what kind of donut should I get?

512
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,580
People... A lot of people were like, mochi donuts.

513
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,740
And I was like, oh!

514
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,420
There's like... There's like a mochi donut place that I've only been to...

515
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,700
I think like once by me.

516
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,420
So I was like, okay!

517
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,820
I will go get a mochi donut.

518
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,720
Um...

519
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,560
And...

520
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,420
Which has gotten more chuckle out of you?

521
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,480
The time has come and so have I, or it's getting bigger.

522
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,120
I definitely think the time has come and so has I.

523
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,240
So have I.

524
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,160
It has made me laugh quite a bit.

525
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,120
Thanks for the super chat!

526
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,940
And so I was like, I want a mochi donut because...

527
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,740
Um...

528
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,960
I've only been to the one place and I haven't had it in a long time.

529
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,580
So...

530
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,480
I went...

531
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,520
And I got a drink with my donut.

532
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,300
And...

533
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,480
The guy...

534
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,940
It was not...

535
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:18,980
Busy.

536
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,200
In the cafe.

537
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,260
But he made it seem like he was doing a lot of stuff.

538
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:26,700
So...

539
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,420
I was like, I'll get a donut and a drink please.

540
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,380
And he said, okay.

541
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,760
And he...

542
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,940
I paid.

543
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,740
And then he gave me my drink a couple minutes later.

544
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:39,420
And I'm sitting there and I was like...

545
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,180
Well, he probably would have given me my donut...

546
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,940
When I first ordered the donut.

547
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,260
And so...

548
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,620
I was like...

549
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,300
Yeah, just one donut.

550
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,000
Just a single donut.

551
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:54,700
And...

552
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm like...

553
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:57,500
Hmm...

554
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,320
Well...

555
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
Maybe once I get my drink, he'll give me the donut.

556
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,660
And I get my drink and he doesn't give me the donut.

557
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,780
And I'm like...

558
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,460
Hmm...

559
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,400
But I also didn't...

560
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,200
He didn't say which...

561
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,860
He didn't ask like, which donut do you want?

562
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,960
And I was like...

563
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,180
Um...

564
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,860
So I was like...

565
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:12,420
Well...

566
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,700
Not all the donuts had labels on them.

567
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,840
So I was gonna ask him.

568
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,640
And so I'm like sitting there.

569
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,080
And he's like, some people come in, some people leave.

570
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,100
You know, not very busy.

571
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,220
Just like, literally, I think like two people came in.

572
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,280
So I was like, okay, well.

573
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,740
And then they left.

574
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,940
So I was like, okay, well, um, I'll just, uh... And I'm sitting there.

575
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,340
I'm sitting there.

576
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:46,520
And I was like, it's been, at this point, it's been so long that I feel awkward going up to him and being like, Hey, by the way, I also got a donut.

577
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:55,900
And so I was like, I missed my window of opportunity where it would have been acceptable to ask about my donut.

578
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,840
You know what I mean?

579
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,720
And so I'm sitting there and I'm like, oh, I should probably go up.

580
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,580
And I was like, I was like, okay, finally.

581
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,180
I was like, okay, I'll just go up.

582
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,640
And there's a girl also that has been in the cafe.

583
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,580
And I'm sitting there, or rather, I'm standing there waiting for the guy to come back.

584
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,800
And she's like, do you need help?

585
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:22,320
And I was like, oh, I was going to ask about the donuts, what other kinds there were.

586
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,720
And she was like, oh, that's my boyfriend.

587
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,500
I'll get his attention.

588
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,360
And so she did.

589
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,900
And he comes up and he's like, oh, yeah, did you need something?

590
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,480
And I was like, oh, I wanted to ask about what kind of donuts these were.

591
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
And he told me.

592
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,000
And I was like, oh, cool.

593
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,040
Can I get this one?

594
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,840
And then he's like, yeah, sure.

595
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,080
And then he starts ringing me up.

596
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,520
And I'm like, oh, no.

597
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,440
He forgot that I previously paid for the donut.

598
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,080
But then I was doubting myself because I didn't get a receipt.

599
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,680
That's why I was like doubting myself.

600
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,920
I was like, maybe how much tip did I put on?

601
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,800
I don't remember.

602
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,900
Maybe my drink plus the tip was this amount.

603
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,280
So he didn't actually hear me the first time.

604
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,060
And I did pay.

605
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,380
I don't know.

606
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:14,060
And so he rings me up.

607
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,740
And I'm like getting my card ready.

608
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,180
And then he goes, wait a second.

609
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,800
Didn't you pay?

610
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,600
And I was like, or he was like, didn't you ask for a donut earlier?

611
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,680
And I was like, yeah, yeah, I think so.

612
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,540
I forgot.

613
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,540
It's like a defense mechanism.

614
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,860
And then he goes, oh, yeah, my bad.

615
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,920
And I was like, oh, thanks.

616
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,120
He gave you an owl.

617
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:55,580
I know.

618
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,960
And then I got my donut and it wasn't very good.

619
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,020
It was fine.

620
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,660
It was good.

621
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,340
It was just like, didn't have as much flavor as I thought it would.

622
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,100
Oh.

623
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,100
But I said I forgot, even though I didn't actually forget.

624
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,760
Because I was sitting there being like, oh, I got a donut with my thing.

625
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,540
But he forgot about my donut.

626
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,840
But I just said it as a defense mechanism to be like, so not...

627
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,380
I was like, in my brain, I'm like, oh, if I say I forgot, that's like nonchalant, right?

628
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,120
Like, oh, yeah, yeah, I totally...

629
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,720
Oh, oh, I got a donut.

630
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,300
Oh, oh, God.

631
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,340
Oh, God.

632
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,560
So I can never...

633
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,920
I can never haunt that location ever again.

634
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,200
Luckily, it's not my own cafe.

635
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,920
Totally nonchalant.

636
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,980
Yeah, I'll never go back.

637
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:01,960
Not because...

638
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,560
Sorry, I'm crying, so I'm wiping my tears.

639
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,140
Not because the donut was bad, but because...

640
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,600
Because, um... But because I fear I was way too awkward to ever go back.

641
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,540
But the guy was nice.

642
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,540
The guy was nice.

643
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,340
I just... So it wasn't his fault.

644
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,960
Well, I guess it was his fault for forgetting.

645
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,880
It's also my fault for not saying anything.

646
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,200
Boston cream for next time?

647
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,280
Yeah, I'm gonna get Boston cream next time.

648
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,220
And find a different mochi donut place.

649
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,800
I'm baking cookies right now.

650
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,900
You want them thick and soft or thin and crispy.

651
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,380
Thick and soft!

652
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,620
Oh, wait, but I like the edges to be crispy.

653
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,220
Does anyone else like their cookies like that?

654
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,180
Where like the... You know when you take them right out of the oven and you give it just a little bit of time.

655
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,480
So where the edges become nice and crispy.

656
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,740
But then the inside is still really warm and soft.

657
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,160
That's the best.

658
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,980
That's the best, baby.

659
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,500
Okay, what was I playing?

660
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,100
I don't think I have any more that I can pay.

661
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,340
Or rather, you know, I don't think I can...

662
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,780
I kind of want to switch.

663
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,620
Oh wait, I haven't even edited my magazine.

664
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:30,400
Okay, hold on.

665
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,580
Wait, how do I...

666
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,940
How do I...

667
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,830
Speaking of switch, did you guys get the switch?

668
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,750
Wait, why can't I put it in?

669
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,430
Oh, I already did.

670
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,050
Oh, okay.

671
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:52,870
Oh, you're right.

672
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:53,450
It says magazine.

673
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:53,870
Sorry.

674
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,730
I want to do this one.

675
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,890
Wait.

676
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,650
But rocket punch.

677
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,070
Maybe I'll do rocket punch.

678
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,780
Waiting for more games.

679
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,540
Tomodachi Life 2.

680
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:25,600
Hi, Mint.

681
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,420
I'm at a convention.

682
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:30,400
Is it cool if I publicly broadcast your embarrassing donut stories?

683
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,120
No!

684
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:33,860
No!

685
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,040
Don't!

686
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:37,720
Don't!

687
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,140
I don't want the world!

688
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,780
Also, you guys, I get a gorb.

689
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,360
There's login bonuses.

690
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,360
Oh my gosh, I forgot how terrifying the blorb is.

691
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,480
I got a gorb as a login bonus, so...

692
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,140
Maybe I should just log in every day that I'm not...

693
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,200
Or, like, open up the game every day even if I'm not streaming it.

694
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,080
Not until it doesn't eat up a college tuition to buy.

695
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:01,800
That's fair.

696
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,760
I love that you explained the whole donut story and never explained how gangster relates to it.

697
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:07,980
Oh!

698
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,970
Vivicor, thank you for the 5-gifted.

699
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,630
So, I...

700
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,850
Okay.

701
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,090
I used to use the Google keyboard.

702
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,870
I don't remember.

703
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,550
G-board or whatever.

704
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,870
And I was like...

705
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:28,590
I don't know.

706
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,110
It's...

707
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,250
Okay.

708
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,710
I switched back to my...

709
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,270
I have a...

710
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,070
I have a...

711
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,830
Samsung Galaxy.

712
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,010
And I switched back to the Galaxy...

713
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,870
Like, the Samsung keyboard because...

714
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,450
I felt that, like, the Google keyboard became so bloated with stuff.

715
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,310
I was like, there's just so much here that I don't care about.

716
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:52,810
And...

717
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,610
Which is so ironic because you...

718
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:56,650
Samsung phones are known for their bloatware.

719
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,130
And so...

720
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:00,210
And so...

721
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,070
But the keyboard is pretty clean.

722
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,150
Actually.

723
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:06,210
So...

724
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:07,470
Um...

725
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,450
I feel...

726
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:08,790
Yeah.

727
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,330
It does have a lot.

728
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,910
It does!

729
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,010
Google keeps messing with UI.

730
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,950
I know!

731
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,610
It's so annoying.

732
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,950
Shift key.

733
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,670
I've never tried that before.

734
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:19,390
Shift key.

735
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,170
Hold on.

736
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:20,850
Let me write it down.

737
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:22,830
Shift key.

738
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:23,730
I'll look into it.

739
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,110
But I also have, like, a custom...

740
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,130
Uh...

741
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,530
What's the word?

742
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:30,190
Custom...

743
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,250
Theme for my phone.

744
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,830
And so the keyboard now matches the theme.

745
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,110
But the...

746
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,310
But the autocorrect on it is...

747
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,750
Is so bad.

748
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,170
Oh, Swift!

749
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:42,730
Sorry.

750
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,290
Thank you.

751
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,370
Swift key.

752
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,650
The autocorrect is so bad.

753
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,330
And I taught...

754
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,470
Tried typing...

755
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,790
Having...

756
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,070
Like...

757
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,310
Or...

758
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,930
I haven't.

759
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,250
No.

760
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,190
Because I was writing.

761
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,510
I haven't had a mochi donut in a long time.

762
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,290
And instead of haven't...

763
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,910
It changed it to gangster.

764
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,270
It changed it to gangster.

765
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:05,930
Swift key.

766
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,090
I'll try it out.

767
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,610
Swift key.

768
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,130
Swift key.

769
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,470
Gangster donut.

770
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:18,050
So now I'm...

771
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:18,610
Gangster.

772
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,770
Yo, yo, yo.

773
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,710
I'm...

774
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,650
Gangster donut.

775
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:24,870
That's my...

776
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,370
That's my gangster name.

777
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,750
Donut.

778
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:28,350
Wait.

779
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,650
Gangster donut.

780
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,010
Yo, yo, yo.

781
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,010
A gangster ever heard of autocorrecting something?

782
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,950
I don't know.

783
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,130
And I...

784
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,070
I'm sorry, guys.

785
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,650
I just...

786
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,410
I just send...

787
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,350
I don't read...

788
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,430
Read my tweets.

789
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,950
But like 90% of the time...

790
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:53,510
I only reread messages if it's something important.

791
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,550
Like if I'm...

792
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,450
Like if it's a...

793
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,930
Like a business message or something.

794
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,050
My favorite was...

795
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,430
I will go, go, go donut.

796
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,210
Yeah.

797
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,330
I went, went, went donut.

798
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,810
And I was sad, sad, sad.

799
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,630
Gangster donut is your...

800
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,870
Metal Gear Cone.

801
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,730
Thank you for the super chat.

802
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,530
Thank you, guys.

803
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:18,630
Anyway.

804
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,050
Okay.

805
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:20,590
Anyway.

806
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:21,050
Okay.

807
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,510
Xseed is...

808
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,130
My...

809
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:25,590
Vroom, vroom.

810
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,830
What is breaker plus?

811
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,530
Oh, it just allows me to have another...

812
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:33,810
Okay.

813
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:35,790
Okay.

814
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,310
We got to save up some roars.

815
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,970
People asking if Mito can turn off autocorrect.

816
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,410
And I'm curious if they know what happened last time.

817
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:43,650
Yeah.

818
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,710
I've done that before.

819
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,230
And it's not a pretty sight.

820
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,870
Me without autocorrect.

821
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,650
Especially because I don't...

822
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,690
Check my tweets.

823
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:52,590
My messages.

824
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,390
I just send.

825
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:55,870
Okay.

826
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,190
Flying hunter.

827
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,550
All right.

828
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,970
We're going to try the red punch.

829
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:04,370
Oh.

830
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,750
Oh my gosh.

831
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,650
Nero, you should not be driving around with your feet on the dashboard.

832
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:10,650
That is so dangerous.

833
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,990
If you get into a car accident, you're basically screwed.

834
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,430
Time to forget everything.

835
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:19,330
Yeah, maybe.

836
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,890
It's not that I forget things.

837
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,890
Sometimes I forget.

838
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,550
It's mostly that I panic.

839
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:27,870
Autobots.

840
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,930
One guy managed to beat this game on hardest difficulty without using weapons.

841
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,010
So there isn't really a wrong way to play as long as you win.

842
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,770
So much for teamwork.

843
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,070
Nice.

844
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,290
Niko's cute.

845
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,370
She can get away with it.

846
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:48,310
What the heck is that?

847
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:53,070
When he said gangster donut, my mom went to mint walking into a donut shop.

848
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,090
A friend for the mafia.

849
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:57,810
Wirebound.

850
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,910
Standing on platforms lit with red flames.

851
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:06,070
When no enemies are around, will turn the flames blue and cause grip points to appear in the air.

852
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,630
Are there any enemies around?

853
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:13,750
Hi, Niko!

854
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,410
I guess not.

855
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,210
It's quiet.

856
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,610
Lock onto grim...

857
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:25,530
Oh, I thought they meant like point...

858
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,430
I was like, what the heck is a grim grip point?

859
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,390
Like, what are those points?

860
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,230
I thought it meant like...

861
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,190
Like, you know...

862
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:32,870
Like, points.

863
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,630
Like a score.

864
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:35,370
Uh...

865
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:35,710
Okay.

866
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,230
Yeah, we know how to do this.

867
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,330
Wait, so there's really nothing else around here?

868
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,170
Hold on.

869
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,730
Hold on, before we move onward.

870
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,670
What if I...

871
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,850
What if I take a little dip?

872
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,410
Thanks, Niko!

873
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,110
Okay, bye.

874
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,050
All right.

875
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:00,870
Just Niko dialogue.

876
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,610
I didn't forget people telling me to explore a little bit more in this game.

877
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:06,910
Hi, Robot!

878
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,830
We gotta...

879
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,850
Oh, oh, oh.

880
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,290
Oh, hello?

881
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,930
Hello?

882
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,610
Oh my god.

883
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,530
Oh, ouch!

884
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:16,230
Wait.

885
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:23,760
Wait.

886
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,100
No.

887
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,420
Stop.

888
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,520
Oh, there we go.

889
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,080
Woo!

890
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,560
How are you supposed to combo while it's doing that?

891
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:56,390
Can you still attack with the sword while it's...

892
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,910
While it's punching him?

893
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:00,230
Oh.

894
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,630
You can!

895
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:04,710
That's so funny.

896
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,690
What else is around here?

897
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,410
Oh, another...

898
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:10,730
Grippy...

899
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:12,810
Grippy...

900
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:13,330
Grippy grip...

901
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:13,950
Grabby grub.

902
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:16,290
All right.

903
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,990
I'm gripping.

904
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,250
Oh, I'm not gripping.

905
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,750
My grippers...

906
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,770
Shoo!

907
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,210
Did you forget you can wire grab enemies?

908
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,230
Maybe?

909
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,430
I don't know.

910
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:29,530
I don't know.

911
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,270
Shut up!

912
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:35,590
Stop it!

913
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,790
I just started playing!

914
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,310
Punch?

915
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:39,890
Oh, okay.

916
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:41,230
I was like, what the heck is this?

917
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,050
I thought it was an invisible wall for a second.

918
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,890
Roll...

919
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:45,350
Roll...

920
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:45,410
Roll...

921
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:45,530
Roll...

922
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:45,550
Roll...

923
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,330
Roll...

924
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,510
Leave that sweet, sweet money.

925
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:52,610
Oh!

926
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,070
Secret blur...

927
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,070
Blurb!

928
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,310
This thing is so ugly.

929
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,290
Oh, God!

930
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,010
It's so scary!

931
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,270
I don't like him.

932
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,570
Nasty!

933
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:09,470
Blurb!

934
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,530
Yay, blurb!

935
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,630
Yeah.

936
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:21,050
Wait, was there a... Was there a spot that... Oh, what's that over there?

937
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:23,990
Wait, how do I... How do I get to the massive RORB?

938
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:25,490
Wait.

939
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:27,950
Tons of RORB.

940
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,330
How do I get to there?

941
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,730
So rude to him.

942
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,370
He can't... He has no feelings.

943
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,450
Jump pad, but where?

944
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:45,910
Why is the music so like... It's kinda cute.

945
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,570
Oh, here we go.

946
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:49,510
Oh, sorry.

947
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:51,090
I'm probably making... I'm making myself dizzy.

948
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:52,510
Wee!

949
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,810
And then I'm gonna attack you too.

950
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,480
Baby.

951
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:36,800
Oh my god.

952
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,700
Oh, where the hell did you come from?

953
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,000
Oh!

954
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,580
Ouch.

955
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,040
Helter Skelter.

956
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,280
Oh.

957
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,460
Oh no, I broke it.

958
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,500
Wait, when did I break it?

959
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,920
Wait, when did I break it?

960
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,780
Why am I on Helter Skelter?

961
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,120
Where's all my things at?

962
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,260
Happy birthday!

963
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,370
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

964
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:13,770
Nice.

965
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,210
Got him.

966
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,430
How did I break it?

967
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,850
They break when you get hit.

968
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,450
while they're in use.

969
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:21,910
Oh!

970
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,350
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

971
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,930
Good to know.

972
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:32,230
I thought it only broke if you held down the beat.

973
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:34,830
Can I go back to the... Oh no!

974
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,050
My red punch!

975
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,290
But also... I went through two!

976
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:44,430
I didn't even... I went through two arms and I didn't even notice.

977
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:46,350
Oh, hold on.

978
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:50,590
Uh... Blalalalalalalalalala.

979
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,490
Uh, villain!

980
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:52,470
Happy birthday!

981
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,190
Not to take away from wacky woohoo.

982
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,050
But my niece thinks you're very pretty.

983
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,830
And tried to wave hi at you.

984
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:58,610
Hello!

985
00:41:59,450 --> 00:41:59,850
Oh!

986
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,110
Can I get a birthday for Ellie?

987
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,570
Happy birthday, Ellie!

988
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,030
Happy birthday!

989
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:08,070
Hello, hello!

990
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,270
Sorry that I was punching things.

991
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,350
Zero, welcome to membership.

992
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,180
Blorb looks like it's having a flashback.

993
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,670
Of being called funny name when it was a child Blorb.

994
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,530
It looks like it sees all.

995
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,160
Like its brain is just...

996
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,230
Seeing everything.

997
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,070
Okay...

998
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,170
I want to get over there.

999
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:36,610
I have to figure out how to get over there.

1000
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:38,410
What is this puzzle?

1001
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:43,750
Oh!

1002
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,230
Oh!

1003
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,150
Oh, it's the nasties!

1004
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:50,470
Um...

1005
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,910
Wait, I hear somebody!

1006
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,170
I heard...

1007
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:57,470
Oh!

1008
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:57,930
Oh!

1009
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,290
Oh!

1010
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:58,690
Hi, V!

1011
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:01,510
He's like, it's my turn now!

1012
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:02,410
Hahaha!

1013
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:06,570
Everyone was wishing her a happy birthday.

1014
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:08,950
What?

1015
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,250
What are you talking about?

1016
00:43:10,570 --> 00:43:11,110
I mean...

1017
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:11,750
Yeah, I saw that.

1018
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,990
Oh, there was a...

1019
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:16,410
Maybe I can go back.

1020
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:20,850
Which way?

1021
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:21,270
Oh!

1022
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:23,350
This one goes...

1023
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:23,770
Oh!

1024
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,030
Oh!

1025
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:25,930
What's happening?

1026
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,090
What is going on?

1027
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,530
What are you doing over there, mister?

1028
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:35,050
This game is making me all over the place.

1029
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,630
Wait...

1030
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,810
Oh, I can grab it now!

1031
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:38,350
Nice!

1032
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:38,610
Okay.

1033
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:41,450
Yeah!

1034
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:42,830
She was a little busy.

1035
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:43,230
Yeah!

1036
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:44,550
I saw...

1037
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,070
Sorry, I can't wish people a happy birthday always immediately.

1038
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:50,110
Don't say I'm late though.

1039
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:52,650
I think late would be...

1040
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,770
If I'm like...

1041
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,630
You know...

1042
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,110
Completely...

1043
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:58,010
A different day.

1044
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,810
Let's see.

1045
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:02,710
Let's go back.

1046
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:05,130
How do I get over to the big...

1047
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:14,830
I know it's hard to believe, but I'm playing a video game.

1048
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:18,850
It might be hard to believe, but...

1049
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,070
I am...

1050
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,750
Playing a game.

1051
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,050
Trying to pay attention to it.

1052
00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:27,810
Trying...

1053
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:28,610
Is the key word.

1054
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:30,250
I'm trying...

1055
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,150
I've heard it's an attempt.

1056
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:31,650
Wait!

1057
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:34,550
Maybe it's off the side of the building too.

1058
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,570
Hold on...

1059
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:37,190
I really want all those roars!

1060
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,270
Oh no, there's nothing.

1061
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:42,670
Hmm...

1062
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:42,830
Hmm...

1063
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,330
No, no, no, no, no, no...

1064
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,710
No, no, no, no, no...

1065
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,030
Over there?

1066
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:53,490
Maybe?

1067
00:44:58,910 --> 00:44:59,590
Oh, I...

1068
00:44:59,590 --> 00:44:59,970
Yeah, okay.

1069
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,070
I think I just gotta...

1070
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,030
Continue onward.

1071
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:08,930
It's actually impressive that you notice as many as you do.

1072
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,470
Especially when the timing is off.

1073
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:12,230
Screw it.

1074
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:14,030
We're taking this fucking thing down.

1075
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,790
Wow!

1076
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,090
Uh, mister...

1077
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,410
Uh, there's a three-year-old watching.

1078
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,310
Please, watch your language, Nero!

1079
00:45:22,050 --> 00:45:22,610
Um...

1080
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:23,710
Well, you know, if someone's...

1081
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,710
Sending me money...

1082
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,470
I feel horrible if I...

1083
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:28,250
Don't read...

1084
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:29,470
A message, you know?

1085
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,530
I...

1086
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,090
You know...

1087
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,590
Very much appreciate it.

1088
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:34,730
You know, so...

1089
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:37,290
Minky is never early or late.

1090
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:39,250
I freak...

1091
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:41,450
When I freak, it is with...

1092
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,810
The right time.

1093
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,970
Attacking certain spots.

1094
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:47,770
What am I attacking?

1095
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:49,550
Right there?

1096
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,870
Oh!

1097
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:51,570
Ah!

1098
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,980
Hold your horses.

1099
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,980
So that way will probably lead to over there.

1100
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,560
Yes.

1101
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,100
That makes sense.

1102
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,820
And then...

1103
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,160
Let's get this one over here as well.

1104
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,620
What's in the water?

1105
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,320
Can I grab this?

1106
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,160
Nice.

1107
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:20,540
Ay!

1108
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,850
I don't remember how...

1109
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:26,410
I think I...

1110
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:27,430
I know I can get rid of these.

1111
00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:30,350
Ah!

1112
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,370
Ah!

1113
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:40,830
I got it!

1114
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:41,550
Ay!

1115
00:46:41,550 --> 00:46:41,570
Ay!

1116
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:46,670
I may not have bought the Gabriel Subsperge other than the Tech Deck.

1117
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,230
Oh!

1118
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:47,610
Oh no!

1119
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:48,890
Wait!

1120
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,730
Not a problem!

1121
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,110
Thank you!

1122
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:57,890
Oh, these guys are...

1123
00:46:57,890 --> 00:46:58,630
Oh, hello?

1124
00:46:58,990 --> 00:46:59,950
These guys...

1125
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:02,370
These guys are like babies.

1126
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,610
They are not strong at all.

1127
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:08,370
Oh!

1128
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,340
So now...

1129
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,360
We go back...

1130
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,460
And we go attack this guy...

1131
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,420
To get upstairs.

1132
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:26,820
Oh!

1133
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:27,180
Oh!

1134
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,740
Oh!

1135
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:28,620
Okay.

1136
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:30,580
Come back.

1137
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:31,520
Come back!

1138
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,460
Come back!

1139
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:33,100
Wait!

1140
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:33,520
Where'd he go?

1141
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,520
Wait, did I miss my chance?

1142
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,560
Oh no, he's there.

1143
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:36,780
Okay.

1144
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,040
Oh!

1145
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,300
My bad.

1146
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,220
What?

1147
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,220
That was too late again.

1148
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,000
Cause I'm...

1149
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,360
Stupid.

1150
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:46,780
Alright.

1151
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:49,960
Oh!

1152
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,360
Why can't I...

1153
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,980
Why can't I jump...

1154
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:54,820
In...

1155
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,360
The air?

1156
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,000
Speaking of horses, Umamusume release day has been announced.

1157
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,540
Oh, really?

1158
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,120
Already?

1159
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:01,520
Oh my gosh.

1160
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,700
I predicted that too.

1161
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,600
I think like...

1162
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,000
The other day, I was talking about Umamusume Global.

1163
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,260
Wait for it to fly up.

1164
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,260
I'm too early.

1165
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,460
Oh!

1166
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,060
My bad.

1167
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:15,880
I

1168
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:22,800
thought...

1169
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,320
My brain was like...

1170
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,700
It would...

1171
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,700
Um...

1172
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,460
Oh hi!

1173
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:29,920
Is uh...

1174
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,180
It...

1175
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:32,180
Is uh...

1176
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,360
It would stop...

1177
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:42,700
Hey!

1178
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,000
Come here!

1179
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:45,440
Come here!

1180
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:45,880
Come here!

1181
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,440
Oh my...

1182
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,120
Please!

1183
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,440
Yeah!

1184
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:53,800
Oh my god!

1185
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:54,780
Lots of big butts!

1186
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,600
Oh yeah!

1187
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:00,940
Wait...

1188
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,160
Oh!

1189
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:02,700
KDI!

1190
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,160
Missed her...

1191
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:05,920
Hold on...

1192
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:06,200
Hold on...

1193
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:06,600
Hold on...

1194
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,980
Hold on...

1195
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,660
Random gorg...

1196
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:15,970
Where do you think you're going, eh, buddy?

1197
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,000
More butts, please!

1198
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,440
Where's the rest of the butts?

1199
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,880
Oh, did I miss them?

1200
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,600
Aw man...

1201
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:31,780
Oh well...

1202
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:34,480
Okay...

1203
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,780
I see a grueler...

1204
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,600
They ran away...

1205
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,260
Cowards!

1206
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,960
All of them...

1207
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,040
I lost all my savings on...

1208
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,440
Cyan and horserace does!

1209
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,780
That's just how it goes...

1210
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,120
Thinking about his girl mid-combo...

1211
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:57,480
Wait...

1212
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:58,160
Where is it?

1213
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,580
Oh, I'm not on top of it...

1214
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:00,160
I'm sorry...

1215
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,540
The mother of...

1216
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:08,860
Oh!

1217
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:09,740
Omelettes!

1218
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,420
Wow!

1219
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,000
How much did we get from that?

1220
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,110
Wait...

1221
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:32,970
What do you mean out of time?

1222
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,250
Hmm?

1223
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:35,950
So close?

1224
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,850
Would it like explode?

1225
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:42,750
Or something?

1226
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,530
It oxidized...

1227
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:45,410
Oh...

1228
00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:46,950
So there's time limit...

1229
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,490
There's a tiny amount left...

1230
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:50,870
Oh...

1231
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,290
It's okay!

1232
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,370
And then we go here...

1233
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:56,650
Okay...

1234
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:58,270
That should be good...

1235
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,150
I think we got everything in this area...

1236
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:00,610
So...

1237
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,190
Now we can continue...

1238
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:03,590
Onward!

1239
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:05,870
Another...

1240
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,570
They're handing...

1241
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:08,750
Gorbs out like...

1242
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:10,330
They're handing gorbs out like candy!

1243
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,290
Ordered the mini...

1244
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:14,850
Thank you!

1245
00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:17,610
Thank you so much!

1246
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:18,270
The mini...

1247
00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:19,110
Tech Tech...

1248
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,550
I saw someone say that it was like...

1249
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,950
The perfect size for...

1250
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,110
Chippy Minto...

1251
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:24,610
Or...

1252
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,630
Minto plushie...

1253
00:51:25,630 --> 00:51:27,110
I agree...

1254
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,290
Get her some tiny glasses...

1255
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:30,450
Some tiny sunglasses...

1256
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:31,170
She'll look so cool...

1257
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,590
Who's here?

1258
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:38,930
Nobody?

1259
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,270
It's so quiet!

1260
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:44,450
Quiet...

1261
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:47,450
Why is it so quiet in this part?

1262
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,080
Oh...

1263
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,560
Spooky...

1264
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:02,210
Demon tree blood clots...

1265
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,830
Some demon tree roots contain clots of blood...

1266
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,670
That's so gross!

1267
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:08,070
Destroy these clots to get red orbs...

1268
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:10,270
Destroying the clots sometimes open up new paths...

1269
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,890
Or trigger something in the environment...

1270
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:18,290
Oh...

1271
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:19,350
Oh...

1272
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:19,550
Oh...

1273
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,000
Nasty...

1274
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,320
Holy cow...

1275
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,120
We've gotten...

1276
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,540
So much money...

1277
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:30,780
Punchline...

1278
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:32,970
I wish to obtain you...

1279
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:38,400
This game is very generous with money...

1280
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,400
Ha ha ha...

1281
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,640
Oh...

1282
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,520
Who am I fighting?

1283
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,720
Oh, these guys...

1284
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,220
Out of the way!

1285
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:49,840
Oh...

1286
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,520
Oh...

1287
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,460
Come on...

1288
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,240
Come here, come here...

1289
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,640
Where did the other guy go?

1290
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,400
Come here...

1291
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,120
Hehehe...

1292
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:15,050
Easy peasy...

1293
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:16,510
Just...

1294
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,190
Let's just say you'll need that many...

1295
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:19,250
Gorbs eventually...

1296
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:19,990
Okay...

1297
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,230
I believe it...

1298
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:24,450
I'll try not to waste them willy-nilly for now...

1299
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:25,790
Hehehe...

1300
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:27,110
You know...

1301
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:30,130
Nice...

1302
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:31,050
Wow...

1303
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:31,370
This is so...

1304
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,230
This is so beautiful though...

1305
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,110
It's a little archway...

1306
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,030
Take Kirie here...

1307
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,610
So romantic...

1308
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:46,290
Gotta savor the gorb...

1309
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:48,670
Yummy...

1310
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:49,030
Yummy...

1311
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:49,430
Yummy...

1312
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:52,770
Sorry...

1313
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,330
I'm still...

1314
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:53,990
I don't know why...

1315
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,300
I'm adjusting to the camera...

1316
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,490
Cause it's a little...

1317
00:53:59,330 --> 00:53:59,990
Hyperactive...

1318
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:03,590
Okay...

1319
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,290
We gotta go get the other one now...

1320
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,470
A sewer date...

1321
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:09,370
She would be...

1322
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:10,670
The best smelling thing there...

1323
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,710
Come here...

1324
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:17,330
Oh...

1325
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:17,830
Wait...

1326
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:18,470
Come here...

1327
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:19,990
Are you...

1328
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,840
I can't...

1329
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,420
I can't get this guy...

1330
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,920
Come here...

1331
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,700
Come here...

1332
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,180
Where's everybody else...

1333
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,720
Oh there you are...

1334
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,900
I forgot to go up with you...

1335
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,140
Oh...

1336
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,080
I forgot to go up with you...

1337
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:04,790
Oh...

1338
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:05,030
I forgot to go up with you...

1339
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,050
Where's everybody else...

1340
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:11,810
Oh...

1341
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:14,150
Music's over...

1342
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:22,060
I'll get used to everything again...

1343
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:23,220
Eventually...

1344
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,220
Just give me a little bit of time guys...

1345
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,440
Especially since I didn't play the game very much last time...

1346
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:29,940
But I'll get...

1347
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,280
I'll get back into it...

1348
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:33,200
Eventually...

1349
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,220
This looks explodable...

1350
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:38,860
Woah...

1351
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:40,540
Woah...

1352
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:42,280
Hey...

1353
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,220
It pays to be observant...

1354
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,380
Oh... Hi Nero...

1355
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:47,820
Sorry...

1356
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:48,800
I was looking behind you...

1357
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,100
Anything in here too?

1358
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:56,420
TDA?

1359
00:55:58,860 --> 00:55:59,640
Oh...

1360
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,480
What the?

1361
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:01,580
Where?

1362
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,230
Who are you?

1363
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:08,650
Oh...

1364
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:09,170
Who are you?

1365
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:11,110
Oh...

1366
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:20,360
Yeah...

1367
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,080
Yeah...

1368
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,620
Yeah...

1369
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,400
Run away!

1370
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,380
Oh, come here?

1371
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:35,010
Run away?

1372
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:36,810
Come here?

1373
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:40,290
Dodge.

1374
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:40,670
Dodge.

1375
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,490
Dodge.

1376
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:52,750
I don't think I.

1377
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:53,170
Wait, wait.

1378
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:54,910
Woo!

1379
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,270
Hi, John.

1380
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:57,770
Yeah.

1381
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,610
Come here.

1382
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:06,890
Oh.

1383
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:11,210
Stay away!

1384
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:22,300
Get over here.

1385
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,140
Nice parry.

1386
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,060
Thank you!

1387
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,580
Nice.

1388
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,880
Alright, stinkos.

1389
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:38,280
What's in here?

1390
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,220
Explosions.

1391
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:39,620
Explosives?

1392
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,820
Am I supposed to blow that up?

1393
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,920
Will I die?

1394
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:47,160
Maybe there's a guy from the science team in the dumpster.

1395
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:48,660
Yeah.

1396
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:50,620
Most likely, right?

1397
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,700
I'm scared of touching this.

1398
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,680
Will it blow up?

1399
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:58,620
Can I get an MGS birthday for our blue boy in the chat?

1400
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:04,960
I'm not... Well, I guess it's not a traditional birthday song.

1401
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,140
I'm not doing birthday songs at the moment just because my voice has been...

1402
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,540
very rough lately.

1403
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:20,900
But I can probably do a Metal Gear one because it's not so sing-songy.

1404
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,800
Happy birthday!

1405
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,740
Congratulations!

1406
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:28,460
Happy birthday with salutations!

1407
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,420
Happy birthday!

1408
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,940
May your sky stay blue!

1409
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,680
Happy birthday to you!

1410
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,280
Blue boy, happy birthday!

1411
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,120
Yeah.

1412
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,180
Yeah.

1413
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:42,780
Sorry, guys.

1414
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:43,600
I have to hold off.

1415
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,560
Probably for... I'm gonna try blowing it up.

1416
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:47,540
Okay, never mind.

1417
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,940
Probably for like the next couple of months since I'm...

1418
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:53,660
Uh... Yeah.

1419
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,140
But birthday songs will return eventually.

1420
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,750
Thank you and apologies.

1421
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:06,230
No, no need to apologize.

1422
00:59:07,530 --> 00:59:07,950
Meow!

1423
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:11,290
Oh, this guy again?

1424
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:12,950
Oh!

1425
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:14,430
I did blow it up this time!

1426
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:20,890
Wait.

1427
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:21,930
Ah, there we go.

1428
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,710
The way I was...

1429
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:25,510
The way I was...

1430
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,050
There we go.

1431
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:40,450
Get away from me!

1432
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:42,350
You crazy?

1433
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:43,150
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

1434
00:59:52,450 --> 00:59:54,150
I'm not realizing what face...

1435
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,830
the way I'm facing.

1436
00:59:55,210 --> 00:59:56,690
So I'm trying to do the combo.

1437
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,210
Like that.

1438
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:00,610
Oh!

1439
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,010
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1440
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:04,670
Come here.

1441
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:06,770
Ooh!

1442
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:09,950
Did not parry that one.

1443
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:13,690
Ouch!

1444
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:14,890
Oh!

1445
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,310
Oh, there's more!

1446
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:24,810
Oh.

1447
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:26,850
Where did you come from?

1448
01:00:26,850 --> 01:00:26,970
Let's go!

1449
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:32,210
Yeah!

1450
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,440
You know what?

1451
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,060
Screw this!

1452
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,360
Yeah!

1453
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,340
This guy scares me.

1454
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:46,060
Whoo!

1455
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,360
Yeah!

1456
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,000
Ha ha haa!

1457
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:51,840
That guy scares me.

1458
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,340
I knew we would be able to use that.

1459
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,720
Wait, did I see something here?

1460
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:09,380
I saw something glow in... my imagination.

1461
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,420
I'm delusional.

1462
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,160
Hi from Level Up Cod.

1463
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,800
I'm browsing the dealer's room.

1464
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,260
Thank you, Agent.

1465
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:19,860
I'll be having fun.

1466
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:25,600
And then there was... I saw... I thought I saw a little thingy.

1467
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,380
It's a grabby-grab, but maybe not.

1468
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,080
Oh, there it is.

1469
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:29,820
I did.

1470
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,720
I'm not completely delusional.

1471
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,080
Okay, there's a hole up there, but they're totally ignoring the flashing blue light that indicates...

1472
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:47,060
Potentially... a bilarb fragment.

1473
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:50,200
Take it.

1474
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,140
There we go.

1475
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:51,660
Nice.

1476
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,580
Anything underneath the stairs?

1477
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,040
Nope.

1478
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,140
Potential blower fragment within our vicinity?

1479
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,580
Again, sorry.

1480
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,060
If the camera makes you dizzy, it's making me a little bit dizzy.

1481
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,320
Wait.

1482
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,500
Not yet.

1483
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,360
Not yet.

1484
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:14,520
Not yet.

1485
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,720
What is it?

1486
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:24,010
There we go.

1487
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:25,190
Easy.

1488
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:30,690
Good.

1489
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:31,750
Good.

1490
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:32,750
There we go.

1491
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,130
Where is it?

1492
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,570
Wah!

1493
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:45,430
Hot blorbs in their area.

1494
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,990
She was smoking.

1495
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,210
Sexy style.

1496
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:54,810
Okay.

1497
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:00,280
Nero.

1498
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,960
Nero.

1499
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:04,600
It's so embarrassing.

1500
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:07,760
Oh, that's not where the hole is.

1501
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:07,860
Oh my gosh.

1502
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,680
That's where the hole is.

1503
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:22,970
Why is it showing me how many arms I got?

1504
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:24,070
Oh.

1505
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:28,730
Whoa!

1506
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:31,830
Hot blower?

1507
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:36,310
No way.

1508
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,630
I'm going to cry.

1509
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:42,230
No!

1510
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,230
No!

1511
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,030
No!

1512
01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:48,170
No!

1513
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:49,990
No!

1514
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:52,750
Please just leave.

1515
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:53,230
Oh.

1516
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:54,870
Yeah, exactly.

1517
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:55,490
Just leave.

1518
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:57,270
Okay.

1519
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,510
Nice.

1520
01:03:58,910 --> 01:03:59,690
Please just leave.

1521
01:04:03,820 --> 01:04:05,370
I don't want to deal with you.

1522
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:06,370
Whoa.

1523
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:07,970
Oh, yeah.

1524
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,010
I hate books.

1525
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:10,870
I hate learning.

1526
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:13,570
Goodbye, books.

1527
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:14,830
Hate books.

1528
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,070
Hate books.

1529
01:04:16,930 --> 01:04:18,690
Libraries, be gone.

1530
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,390
Uh...

1531
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:27,350
What is...

1532
01:04:27,350 --> 01:04:28,210
Okay.

1533
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:30,630
So we just...

1534
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:32,490
Hate tables.

1535
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:33,710
And books.

1536
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:37,010
Nobody should ever learn in this room ever again.

1537
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:38,870
Wow, I really just...

1538
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:40,330
Destroyed everything in here.

1539
01:04:41,830 --> 01:04:43,010
Paintings are fine.

1540
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,030
That is art.

1541
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:51,570
Oh.

1542
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:53,730
I'm going to cry.

1543
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,410
Oh, God.

1544
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,310
I'm GS2 style.

1545
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:05,710
Stop parrying me, please.

1546
01:05:06,430 --> 01:05:07,130
You bastard.

1547
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:18,720
Stop it!

1548
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:19,640
Please!

1549
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:33,890
A second one!

1550
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:35,530
I'm going to kill you.

1551
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:36,810
I'm going to kill you, actually.

1552
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:38,390
I'm going to kill the game.

1553
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:39,990
Oh, golly.

1554
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:58,360
Please!

1555
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:05,310
Just get me out of here.

1556
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,630
They're not nearly as bad as before, I guess.

1557
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:14,150
Oh.

1558
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,310
Give me your...

1559
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:17,390
Give me your pieces of your body.

1560
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,850
I hate busts!

1561
01:06:21,270 --> 01:06:22,830
Of the stone variety.

1562
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:27,130
Oh, my God.

1563
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,950
You can really just tear this place apart!

1564
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:32,410
Aw.

1565
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,290
Why does the music feel so whimsical?

1566
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:40,070
Blah!

1567
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,930
Old men!

1568
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:43,350
Oh.

1569
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:44,390
Are okay.

1570
01:06:48,050 --> 01:06:49,250
No books!

1571
01:06:49,350 --> 01:06:50,010
No learning!

1572
01:06:52,010 --> 01:06:54,010
Close the schools!

1573
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,770
Hey, thanks!

1574
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:01,110
Yikes!

1575
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:05,390
Oh!

1576
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,160
So funny!

1577
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:13,980
This game is so silly!

1578
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:15,640
Oh!

1579
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:16,380
Nice!

1580
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:21,120
Punchline!

1581
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,040
Weeeee!

1582
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:25,540
Oh!

1583
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:26,800
Look at that!

1584
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:30,760
Dang it.

1585
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:36,890
Platforming.

1586
01:07:38,490 --> 01:07:40,070
There will be an attempt.

1587
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:44,730
Maybe I can just get...

1588
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:44,850
Wait.

1589
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,410
Maybe I can just get that one.

1590
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:47,750
You know?

1591
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:50,130
Maybe I don't have to go through the whole platforming sequence.

1592
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,030
Maybe I can just...

1593
01:07:53,030 --> 01:07:53,590
Be good.

1594
01:07:54,030 --> 01:07:54,310
Okay.

1595
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:57,590
Oh.

1596
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,470
Mm-hmm.

1597
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:03,130
Yeah.

1598
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:03,990
Mm-hmm.

1599
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:05,170
That's it.

1600
01:08:05,370 --> 01:08:05,470
Mm-hmm.

1601
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:08,550
Aha!

1602
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:10,390
Yahoo!

1603
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:13,010
My double trigger.

1604
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:19,890
Where are we?

1605
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:21,190
Oh!

1606
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:26,650
You can air taunt as your double job.

1607
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:26,930
You can?

1608
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:27,850
Right now!

1609
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:28,690
Oh, I guess so.

1610
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,170
Oh my gosh!

1611
01:08:29,250 --> 01:08:31,490
I've been forgetting to do this this entire time, huh?

1612
01:08:35,170 --> 01:08:35,870
What the...

1613
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:36,070
Oh!

1614
01:08:38,050 --> 01:08:38,450
Wow!

1615
01:08:40,030 --> 01:08:40,430
Beautiful!

1616
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:44,230
Hope my girlfriend's doing well.

1617
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:47,990
Without strength, I can't protect anything.

1618
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,770
I know that.

1619
01:08:51,570 --> 01:08:52,410
This way.

1620
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,990
Phone.

1621
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,570
No books means no Mothman nor Lich Lord, Mito.

1622
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:03,070
I...

1623
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:05,730
You're really making it sound like that's a bad thing?

1624
01:09:09,470 --> 01:09:11,150
Was that a bad thing?

1625
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:16,070
Let's get at one.

1626
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,690
There we go.

1627
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:20,530
Wait.

1628
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:22,310
That's right!

1629
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:23,290
I can call her!

1630
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:27,970
We can call Niko.

1631
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,910
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

1632
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:33,050
You're up, Niko.

1633
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:34,510
Come on in.

1634
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:35,430
How's she gonna get in you?

1635
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,610
Oh my god!

1636
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,190
No, I got you covered, asshole.

1637
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:45,570
Damn!

1638
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:48,310
Okay!

1639
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:49,750
Let me in.

1640
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,370
There's the other...

1641
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:50,930
Oh, there we go.

1642
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,430
Customize.

1643
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:52,890
Customize.

1644
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:53,470
Yo!

1645
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:54,770
You just here to window shop?

1646
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,230
We got so much money now.

1647
01:09:59,730 --> 01:10:00,990
What should we get?

1648
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:01,070
I'll just grab it.

1649
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,050
Huh.

1650
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:08,230
I could keep saving up for a wire snatch three.

1651
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:10,630
Oh.

1652
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,210
Table hopper's worth it.

1653
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:16,730
Is it really?

1654
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,700
I never use it in the other games, so...

1655
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,790
All on the ground just before an attack.

1656
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:24,210
Press Rb.

1657
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:25,890
Horizontally.

1658
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:26,290
A.

1659
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:28,990
Or, wait.

1660
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:31,770
Wait, I'm not thinking of... I'm thinking of enemy step.

1661
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:34,890
I'm not thinking of... table hopper.

1662
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,350
Is this not a dodge?

1663
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,710
It's a really good dodge.

1664
01:10:48,550 --> 01:10:51,390
Oh, but I can't because it's right before an attack.

1665
01:10:52,210 --> 01:10:52,590
Wait, hold on.

1666
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:55,750
I know I can do it in the set... Wait, is it in enemy settings?

1667
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:56,350
Here we go, okay.

1668
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:58,490
Enemy action on.

1669
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,750
Oh, wow!

1670
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:02,390
I can change what enemy... Wait, enemy damage.

1671
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:03,390
You know what?

1672
01:11:03,570 --> 01:11:03,950
On.

1673
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:04,650
On for both.

1674
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:05,910
So I can practice.

1675
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,530
You can change what enemy it is!

1676
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:11,350
I will... I will cry.

1677
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:14,950
I will cry.

1678
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,010
Let's just stick it to the normal guy.

1679
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,590
And... attack.

1680
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:30,770
Attack.

1681
01:11:30,930 --> 01:11:31,430
Oh.

1682
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:33,190
And...

1683
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:34,170
You gonna attack?

1684
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:35,830
And...

1685
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:36,050
Attack.

1686
01:11:38,010 --> 01:11:38,770
Attack.

1687
01:11:39,190 --> 01:11:39,750
Oh wait, no.

1688
01:11:39,970 --> 01:11:40,390
You're slow.

1689
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:40,870
Attack!

1690
01:11:42,230 --> 01:11:43,150
Am I doing it?

1691
01:11:47,450 --> 01:11:48,650
Did I... Was that it?

1692
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:50,810
Haline.

1693
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,050
The stinger from...

1694
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:54,030
Air to ground.

1695
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:55,070
Too early.

1696
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,540
No.

1697
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:04,820
It's frame perfect?

1698
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:05,280
It's frame perfect?

1699
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,380
Oh, I will never get it then.

1700
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,480
Am I still too early?

1701
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:11,760
Ah!

1702
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:16,530
I see, I see, I see.

1703
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,870
I see.

1704
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:20,610
Oh!

1705
01:12:20,910 --> 01:12:21,410
Oh!

1706
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:22,090
Oh my gosh.

1707
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:23,590
Chill out.

1708
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:27,130
Oh.

1709
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:27,690
Oh my gosh.

1710
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:28,890
It's gotta be so...

1711
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:29,490
Perfect.

1712
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:32,310
The timing is not that strict.

1713
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:33,490
Well, clearly it is!

1714
01:12:33,710 --> 01:12:34,050
Hahaha!

1715
01:12:40,310 --> 01:12:41,550
Okay, I think I'm...

1716
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:46,910
See, even when he's swinging!

1717
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:51,310
Even when he's coming down!

1718
01:12:51,310 --> 01:12:52,430
How am I too early?

1719
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:52,550
Really?

1720
01:12:59,530 --> 01:13:00,010
Wow.

1721
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:00,530
Okay.

1722
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:03,490
Okay.

1723
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:10,730
Oh my gosh!

1724
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:12,270
I don't think I'll get it.

1725
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:14,570
I mean, it might be useful to have.

1726
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:16,710
Because if I...

1727
01:13:17,250 --> 01:13:18,330
Oh, that one.

1728
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,210
That one, obviously.

1729
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,270
It might be useful to have just to have.

1730
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:23,430
I mean, it doesn't hurt to have, you know?

1731
01:13:25,530 --> 01:13:27,310
Stinger is useless and dumb.

1732
01:13:27,550 --> 01:13:28,770
Made by Payline and Joy.

1733
01:13:28,770 --> 01:13:29,090
Very cute.

1734
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:30,170
What do you mean?

1735
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,130
It's extra iframes.

1736
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:38,250
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1737
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:41,110
Come here.

1738
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:44,050
Oh, wait.

1739
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,430
Come here.

1740
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:57,050
Ouch, ouch.

1741
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:01,110
Let me try it.

1742
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:01,770
Oh, whoops.

1743
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,510
Oh, yeah.

1744
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,110
Oh, whoop, whoop.

1745
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:04,630
Oh, hold on.

1746
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,130
Let me try with a different enemy, maybe.

1747
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:13,930
I hate myself, so...

1748
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:22,230
Scary.

1749
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:25,550
I'm like in this...

1750
01:14:25,550 --> 01:14:26,490
Oh, okay.

1751
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,910
I gotta also learn when his timing is too.

1752
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:38,170
Exposure therapy.

1753
01:14:38,170 --> 01:14:38,610
Exactly.

1754
01:14:41,030 --> 01:14:41,910
Oh, I...

1755
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:44,230
Oh!

1756
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:46,830
That was good.

1757
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:51,610
That one was way too early.

1758
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:52,090
I could tell.

1759
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:58,560
Ah!

1760
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,860
See, I can tell when it's like...

1761
01:15:00,860 --> 01:15:01,960
It does the shine, you know?

1762
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:02,740
The little...

1763
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,220
Shrink.

1764
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:05,440
Oh!

1765
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:06,040
Oopsie.

1766
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:08,480
Oh!

1767
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,120
My gosh.

1768
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:09,580
Hello?

1769
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:16,000
Like I said, it's cheap, and I don't think it hurts to...

1770
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,480
Have it.

1771
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:19,800
It's cheap, but I don't think it hurts to have it.

1772
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:20,260
So...

1773
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah, I'll grab it.

1774
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:21,540
Why not?

1775
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:24,680
Six frame window.

1776
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,160
Okay.

1777
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:29,300
Uh...

1778
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:29,760
Let's leave.

1779
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:32,500
Mmm.

1780
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:33,840
Doesn't hurt.

1781
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:35,400
I can only get better at it.

1782
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:35,720
Maybe.

1783
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:38,860
And it's...

1784
01:15:38,860 --> 01:15:39,620
Like I said, it's so cheap.

1785
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:40,960
Learn it.

1786
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,260
Personally, I would buy the rest of the exceed levels.

1787
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,720
Some attacks can change when you're on exceed level 3 rather than level 1.

1788
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,100
How much are they?

1789
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:54,100
I can only buy exceed level 2.

1790
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:56,440
I just have to remember to...

1791
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:57,500
To use exceed.

1792
01:15:58,300 --> 01:15:59,880
I have to remember to use it.

1793
01:16:03,970 --> 01:16:04,410
3K...

1794
01:16:04,410 --> 01:16:04,590
Bad.

1795
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,390
No, no.

1796
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:11,780
Now there's also the gun upgrade.

1797
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:13,820
Which I have...

1798
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:14,280
Is this...

1799
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,280
This is just to...

1800
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:15,960
Yeah, fill it up.

1801
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,640
Fire 3 shots.

1802
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:23,100
Can I only get 2 though?

1803
01:16:25,860 --> 01:16:26,840
Ah, there it is.

1804
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:27,400
Level...

1805
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:27,980
Color up 3.

1806
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:29,500
Okay, okay.

1807
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,580
I don't think it hurts to have that either.

1808
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:34,580
Streak 2!

1809
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,500
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1810
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,040
Oh, there's pay line.

1811
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:47,940
Is this what you guys are talking about?

1812
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,720
I don't have enough.

1813
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:53,340
I don't have enough.

1814
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:53,940
Okay, we'll...

1815
01:16:53,940 --> 01:16:55,000
We'll get more money.

1816
01:16:58,660 --> 01:16:59,800
Pay line.

1817
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,420
On the ground.

1818
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:07,040
RB.

1819
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,060
Back.

1820
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,280
Oh, RB.

1821
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:11,740
LS.

1822
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,740
Back to forward.

1823
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:13,120
Ah.

1824
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,540
It's one of those like...

1825
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:14,860
Ooh, ah!

1826
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:15,920
Ooh, ah!

1827
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:16,340
Really.

1828
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:17,640
Why?

1829
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:18,140
Why?

1830
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:19,400
Why?

1831
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:25,170
Why?

1832
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:26,010
Why?

1833
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:31,090
Why?

1834
01:17:31,650 --> 01:17:32,130
Why?

1835
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:34,510
Why?

1836
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,750
Why?

1837
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:36,790
Why?

1838
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:37,350
Why?

1839
01:17:39,070 --> 01:17:41,730
Oh, it's this one where you're like...

1840
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:41,730
Bam!

1841
01:17:42,290 --> 01:17:42,490
Bam!

1842
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:43,110
Bam!

1843
01:17:43,370 --> 01:17:43,710
Bam!

1844
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:45,810
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1845
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,710
I think I'm gonna save up for...

1846
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:51,770
Maybe... is Payline good?

1847
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:53,470
Why?

1848
01:17:53,850 --> 01:17:54,390
Why?

1849
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:55,730
Why?

1850
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:55,830
Why?

1851
01:17:55,950 --> 01:17:57,170
But it's the best combo.

1852
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,510
I think I'm too, like...

1853
01:18:01,030 --> 01:18:03,330
Why spammy for it, but...

1854
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:07,090
I'm just so... I've said this all the other Devil May Cry games.

1855
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,870
I'm so not...

1856
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:10,250
Fighting game built.

1857
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,190
Brained.

1858
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:12,510
So...

1859
01:18:12,510 --> 01:18:14,030
To me...

1860
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:17,090
Learning combos is like...

1861
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:17,610
Oof.

1862
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:22,610
Payline is really good.

1863
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:23,190
Okay.

1864
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:25,650
Try it.

1865
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:26,830
Yeah, you know what?

1866
01:18:26,930 --> 01:18:28,110
Let's try it.

1867
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:29,110
Why?

1868
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,990
Why?

1869
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,790
Oh!

1870
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:31,390
Oh!

1871
01:18:31,810 --> 01:18:32,090
Oh!

1872
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:33,390
Oh!

1873
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:51,430
Why?

1874
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,470
Why?

1875
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:53,890
Why?

1876
01:18:54,630 --> 01:18:54,750
Why?

1877
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:56,690
Wait.

1878
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:58,570
I don't think I did that.

1879
01:18:59,150 --> 01:18:59,750
Why?

1880
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:00,770
Why?

1881
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:05,490
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?

1882
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:06,850
Like that?

1883
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,950
Why, VTuber, why?

1884
01:19:12,270 --> 01:19:30,730
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why,

1885
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:31,070
why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, Why?

1886
01:19:31,310 --> 01:19:31,530
Why?

1887
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:31,990
Why?

1888
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:32,610
Why?

1889
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:36,670
Just slam on him.

1890
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:39,890
Pause after the first, and then just mash.

1891
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:40,730
Okay, okay, okay.

1892
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,830
What?

1893
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:46,950
No, hold on.

1894
01:19:47,070 --> 01:19:47,610
I think I'm mash.

1895
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:47,870
Wait.

1896
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:49,350
Pause.

1897
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:50,070
Pause.

1898
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:51,150
There we go.

1899
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:56,110
God, this feels... this feels like...

1900
01:19:58,470 --> 01:19:58,950
Yeah!

1901
01:19:58,950 --> 01:20:00,450
That's what I was gonna say!

1902
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,290
Nero!

1903
01:20:20,290 --> 01:20:20,810
Nero!

1904
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:22,370
You!

1905
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:29,470
Wow.

1906
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,630
Wowee!

1907
01:20:31,950 --> 01:20:33,430
I can't believe... I...

1908
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,820
Oh my god, you have become one with Nero!

1909
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,640
What sucks is I wish I could like... Oh!

1910
01:20:48,940 --> 01:20:50,240
I still got him in the end.

1911
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:51,460
Can't move forward though.

1912
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,340
Bruh.

1913
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,540
No.

1914
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:01,480
How much of a pause is that?

1915
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:01,920
Is it?

1916
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:04,060
There we go.

1917
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:06,060
Okay, it's a pretty decent pause.

1918
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:10,340
Where's your rev?

1919
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:11,360
I'm practicing!

1920
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:11,620
I'm practicing!

1921
01:21:14,030 --> 01:21:14,480
No.

1922
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,280
Pretty long pause.

1923
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:18,060
There we go.

1924
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:18,600
Ah!

1925
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:22,600
Wow!

1926
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,080
Wait a second!

1927
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:30,860
Wait, hold on.

1928
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:41,270
Stay down.

1929
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,650
Too bad it's not xxxx.

1930
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:43,990
No!

1931
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,870
No xxxx.

1932
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:53,170
Holy!

1933
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:54,470
I'm just going...

1934
01:21:54,470 --> 01:22:25,470
Boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep boop beep bo Are you guys convinced to be...

1936
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:27,750
I can!

1937
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,910
Learn.

1938
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:35,210
And then we'll learn... Payline.

1939
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:37,290
Payline next.

1940
01:22:40,530 --> 01:22:43,390
Then I got my gun up a little bit more.

1941
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:46,190
Wow, only 20%?

1942
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:48,690
Wow.

1943
01:22:49,050 --> 01:22:49,610
Wow.

1944
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:50,950
Wow.

1945
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,710
Wow.

1946
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:53,470
Wow.

1947
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:53,670
Wow.

1948
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:56,630
Wow.

1949
01:22:58,490 --> 01:22:59,790
Oh, wait.

1950
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:04,130
I think I want to.

1951
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:07,410
I think I want to breaker plus two.

1952
01:23:10,170 --> 01:23:11,550
Some are locked for story reasons.

1953
01:23:11,730 --> 01:23:12,570
Ah, that makes sense.

1954
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:14,390
Roulette spin.

1955
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:16,010
It's good for air combo.

1956
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,050
What's a roulette?

1957
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:19,190
I love that they let you try these now.

1958
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:22,070
Roulette spin.

1959
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:22,590
Oh, this one?

1960
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:25,610
Mid-air.

1961
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:26,010
Why?

1962
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,490
Why?

1963
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:27,750
Why?

1964
01:23:37,630 --> 01:23:38,230
Wait.

1965
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,210
Oh, hold on.

1966
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:42,330
Like that?

1967
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:46,930
Is that it?

1968
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:50,150
Yep.

1969
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:50,630
Oh.

1970
01:23:55,290 --> 01:23:55,890
Okay.

1971
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:56,130
Okay.

1972
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:56,870
It is a... Okay.

1973
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:00,430
Ah...

1974
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,340
Ah... Pretty easy, yeah.

1975
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:08,020
Air combos for dummies.

1976
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:08,860
It's me!

1977
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,120
I'm the dummy!

1978
01:24:11,620 --> 01:24:13,660
Mento, thank you so much for the five gifted.

1979
01:24:13,820 --> 01:24:14,360
Thank you!

1980
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,130
Oh, whoops.

1981
01:24:28,570 --> 01:24:28,710
Wait.

1982
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:35,140
Hold on.

1983
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:35,740
I'm trying again.

1984
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:37,100
Eh.

1985
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:40,800
Whoops.

1986
01:24:41,180 --> 01:24:41,320
Wait.

1987
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:41,680
Hold on.

1988
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:41,980
Sorry.

1989
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,160
I need to practice on you.

1990
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:45,540
My bad.

1991
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:45,800
Sorry.

1992
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:46,120
Hold on.

1993
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,380
Ah... Yeah.

1994
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,380
Oh.

1995
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,380
Oh.

1996
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,380
Oh.

1997
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,380
We can lock in too.

1998
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:52,720
Ah... I see.

1999
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:57,040
Ah... Ah... Pogson, welcome to Bamboo Shipt quar.

2000
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,360
You can lock in too.

2001
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:03,180
You can lock in too.

2002
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:04,540
Wait.

2003
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:05,400
Wait, hold on.

2004
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,240
Oh!

2005
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,520
Oh!

2006
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:11,700
Yeah.

2007
01:25:16,950 --> 01:25:18,510
Oh, come here.

2008
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,190
I got them.

2009
01:25:19,190 --> 01:25:19,190
Come here.

2010
01:25:21,910 --> 01:25:22,430
Wow.

2011
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:26,830
Now we're at the same time!

2012
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:28,870
Asking for a law.

2013
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:30,670
Oh, let's see.

2014
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:31,290
I messed up.

2015
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:34,930
Oh, sorry.

2016
01:25:35,010 --> 01:25:39,430
I'm so used to, like, doing the... with this one.

2017
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:39,810
Wait.

2018
01:25:41,990 --> 01:25:42,510
Sorry.

2019
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:44,970
That one.

2020
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:47,250
Press it down.

2021
01:25:47,430 --> 01:25:48,050
Press it down.

2022
01:25:50,190 --> 01:25:51,450
Hold my devil trigger.

2023
01:25:52,930 --> 01:25:53,450
Okay.

2024
01:25:54,410 --> 01:25:55,530
I want to keep playing.

2025
01:25:57,730 --> 01:25:59,210
I want to keep playing.

2026
01:26:00,390 --> 01:26:04,890
I might hold off on this one for now just so I can get another devil breaker.

2027
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:08,870
Spot.

2028
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:12,870
It's one or the other, so... Hmm.

2029
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,080
Whoa.

2030
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:22,840
We could get eight.

2031
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,500
Eight slots.

2032
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:24,020
Yo.

2033
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,700
I'm all revved up.

2034
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:33,420
What does it say?

2035
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:39,140
All that is necessary for evil to succeed is that you do not stand up and fight.

2036
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:40,380
Oh.

2037
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:41,740
And then I heart Osaka.

2038
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,640
Is she supposed to be... Osaken?

2039
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:48,800
Because I can see it.

2040
01:26:49,340 --> 01:26:51,880
I don't break for... Warlocks.

2041
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,010
Capcom is in Osaka.

2042
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:01,510
Oh!

2043
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:02,470
I see.

2044
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:02,850
I see.

2045
01:27:03,050 --> 01:27:03,130
Oh.

2046
01:27:03,470 --> 01:27:06,070
Proud to be... Something.

2047
01:27:06,710 --> 01:27:07,790
It's all torn out.

2048
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:09,450
Osaken?

2049
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:11,070
Oh, wait.

2050
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:11,970
What's these ones up here?

2051
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:21,630
If you can read this... My... Rifle... Will kill you before... You hear... It's sound... So edgy.

2052
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:27,070
It's so edgy.

2053
01:27:27,970 --> 01:27:28,490
Okay.

2054
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:30,510
All right.

2055
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:30,890
Shall we go?

2056
01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:34,730
We're still on... Only... Mission 3.

2057
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:35,190
Whoa.

2058
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:36,290
This looks like a boss room.

2059
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,870
Whoa.

2060
01:27:36,890 --> 01:27:37,150
Wait.

2061
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:37,510
Oh!

2062
01:27:37,510 --> 01:27:37,670
Oh!

2063
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:38,310
Uh-oh.

2064
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:38,750
Wait.

2065
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:41,210
I think this... This looks like a boss room for sure.

2066
01:27:42,070 --> 01:27:42,330
Uh-oh.

2067
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:44,910
Duck.

2068
01:27:44,930 --> 01:27:45,390
Welcome back.

2069
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:46,010
Thank you.

2070
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:50,990
Artemis.

2071
01:27:50,990 --> 01:27:51,430
Whoa.

2072
01:27:51,850 --> 01:27:52,090
Whoa.

2073
01:27:53,710 --> 01:27:54,570
It's hot.

2074
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:58,270
Uh-oh.

2075
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:58,710
It's fast.

2076
01:27:59,070 --> 01:27:59,410
Uh-oh.

2077
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:00,570
Uh-oh.

2078
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:01,850
Please don't be... Oh.

2079
01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,430
Oh gosh.

2080
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:03,190
I can't do all that.

2081
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:04,990
Uh-oh.

2082
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:05,730
Uh-oh.

2083
01:28:05,730 --> 01:28:05,730
What?

2084
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:07,290
No chit-chat or monologue?

2085
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:08,890
Just getting right to the point, huh?

2086
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:11,690
Huh?

2087
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:14,610
Waaaaaah!

2088
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:17,120
I love it.

2089
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:19,800
Whoop!

2090
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,220
Spy charge.

2091
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:26,760
Okay.

2092
01:28:26,980 --> 01:28:27,320
Hold on.

2093
01:28:42,430 --> 01:28:43,330
Whoop!

2094
01:28:43,550 --> 01:28:43,670
Whoop!

2095
01:28:44,070 --> 01:28:44,770
Whoop!

2096
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:45,630
What are these things anyway?

2097
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:54,900
Bullet hell.

2098
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:58,520
I'm reloading.

2099
01:28:58,840 --> 01:28:59,540
Whoop!

2100
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:00,140
Whoop.

2101
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:00,160
Hey!

2102
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:01,360
Don't you...

2103
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,080
Whoop!

2104
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:03,080
Whoop!

2105
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:05,460
Whoop!

2106
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:06,880
Whoop!

2107
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:07,920
Whoop!

2108
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:07,920
Whoa!

2109
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,120
Are these like portals?

2110
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:09,180
Oops.

2111
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:13,940
Ouch.

2112
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,690
Oh my gosh, I'm trying to get closer.

2113
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:23,690
Oh, I can!

2114
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:28,970
Oh my god.

2115
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:36,760
Wait.

2116
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:46,530
Woo!

2117
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:53,510
Come here.

2118
01:29:53,690 --> 01:29:54,270
Wait, come here.

2119
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,490
Come here, please.

2120
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:09,250
My streak is not... Why, why?

2121
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:09,630
Ow!

2122
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:15,910
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

2123
01:30:16,790 --> 01:30:18,450
Can I attach?

2124
01:30:18,690 --> 01:30:20,530
Can I... Oh, what's happening?

2125
01:30:21,810 --> 01:30:22,870
What's happening?

2126
01:30:24,230 --> 01:30:25,210
What's happening?

2127
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:28,250
What's going on?

2128
01:30:28,650 --> 01:30:29,690
Where's she going?

2129
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:30,890
What's happening?

2130
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,870
Where is she?

2131
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:38,100
This doesn't seem very good.

2132
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:38,560
Oh!

2133
01:30:38,980 --> 01:30:39,200
Oh!

2134
01:30:39,380 --> 01:30:39,940
Attack her?

2135
01:30:40,120 --> 01:30:41,380
How am I supposed to get up there?

2136
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,680
How am I supposed to get up there?

2137
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:46,040
She's dead?

2138
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,280
I can't get up there!

2139
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:50,880
Shoot her?

2140
01:30:52,940 --> 01:30:55,660
Oh, I didn't... I just noticed the... Oh, okay.

2141
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:57,160
Ah!

2142
01:30:57,840 --> 01:30:58,700
Oh, no.

2143
01:30:58,920 --> 01:30:59,480
Oh, lady.

2144
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,140
Ah!

2145
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:13,000
Ah!

2146
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:13,680
Whoa!

2147
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:19,830
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2148
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:23,710
Okay...

2149
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,630
I noticed... I just noticed the health around it.

2150
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:27,210
Ahahaha!

2151
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:28,370
Ah!

2152
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:28,710
Ah!

2153
01:31:30,890 --> 01:31:31,270
Oh!

2154
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:32,070
No, no, no!

2155
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:34,950
Oh, that was so close.

2156
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:37,870
I don't think I'm gonna... First try this one!

2157
01:31:38,010 --> 01:31:38,430
Ahahaha!

2158
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:41,030
Please!

2159
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:41,690
Please!

2160
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:51,370
Please!

2161
01:31:51,370 --> 01:31:51,610
Yeah!

2162
01:31:52,790 --> 01:31:53,770
Can I do this one?

2163
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:53,970
Oh!

2164
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:54,830
No, no!

2165
01:31:55,110 --> 01:31:55,310
I'm trying!

2166
01:31:57,890 --> 01:31:58,030
Here we go!

2167
01:32:05,680 --> 01:32:06,640
Oh, my gosh.

2168
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:07,340
My health.

2169
01:32:09,180 --> 01:32:09,580
Please.

2170
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:10,140
Please.

2171
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:11,040
This thing.

2172
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:11,440
Please.

2173
01:32:11,740 --> 01:32:11,860
No!

2174
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:13,840
Oh... Please, I'm trying to lock onto you.

2175
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:14,460
Oh, wait.

2176
01:32:14,580 --> 01:32:15,040
This is locked on.

2177
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:16,600
Oh, nice!

2178
01:32:18,620 --> 01:32:18,940
Ah!

2179
01:32:19,180 --> 01:32:19,360
Ah!

2180
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:19,820
Ah!

2181
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:20,240
Oh!

2182
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:20,520
Nice.

2183
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:20,740
Nice.

2184
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:21,240
Oh!

2185
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:21,980
Oh...

2186
01:32:21,980 --> 01:32:24,400
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l!

2187
01:32:24,700 --> 01:32:25,020
Whoa!

2188
01:32:34,710 --> 01:32:35,030
Oh!

2189
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:37,410
Oh!

2190
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:37,810
Oh, gosh.

2191
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:46,370
We're so close!

2192
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:01,610
Nice!

2193
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:04,930
I did it, first try.

2194
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:15,190
Imbi!

2195
01:33:21,630 --> 01:33:25,470
Right in the sucker.

2196
01:33:34,110 --> 01:33:35,390
Hello?

2197
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,250
Do I need to censor this?

2198
01:33:39,050 --> 01:33:40,510
Ma'am?

2199
01:33:42,690 --> 01:33:43,930
It is Lady!

2200
01:33:45,030 --> 01:33:46,410
I was like, is that Lady?

2201
01:33:55,150 --> 01:33:55,750
Damn.

2202
01:33:57,370 --> 01:33:58,810
Nero, you...

2203
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:00,450
Get your hands off of her!

2204
01:34:05,490 --> 01:34:07,250
Don't do anything I would do.

2205
01:34:08,590 --> 01:34:10,610
Chica-bow-wow, chica-bow-wow.

2206
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:13,430
Bow-chica-bow-wow, chica-chica-bow-wow.

2207
01:34:14,750 --> 01:34:16,470
Kitty-A would kill me right now.

2208
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:17,350
Yeah, she would.

2209
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:19,390
Yeah.

2210
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:23,010
Maybe you have the Lady friend take care of her, you know?

2211
01:34:24,290 --> 01:34:25,450
Maybe you have...

2212
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:30,050
Maybe you have Niko bring her to the car or something instead.

2213
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:34,750
You were in a library the last time you fought, lady.

2214
01:34:34,950 --> 01:34:36,190
Oh my gosh, you're right!

2215
01:34:37,590 --> 01:34:39,810
Nero and V split up to find separate paths.

2216
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,950
Oh, dang it.

2217
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,260
What color was Nero's arm?

2218
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:52,660
Blue?

2219
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,820
But for now...

2220
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,660
We have more pressing engagement.

2221
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:05,340
Stuck on this boss like four times when I played it.

2222
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,400
Hee hee.

2223
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:12,510
Oh!

2224
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:14,830
V!

2225
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:20,970
Command three demons on the battlefield controlling the flow of combat from a distance.

2226
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:21,850
Oh!

2227
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:22,690
Hell yeah!

2228
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:26,230
Vitality and orbs held carry over, but you can obtain skills for V.

2229
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:27,270
What?

2230
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:28,970
Nero and V split...

2231
01:35:28,970 --> 01:35:30,890
I can't read fast enough.

2232
01:35:33,070 --> 01:35:33,910
Oh no!

2233
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,210
Oh my gosh.

2234
01:35:35,410 --> 01:35:36,530
I'm already changing characters?

2235
01:35:37,910 --> 01:35:41,890
Why does his cat look like a giant rat instead?

2236
01:35:43,130 --> 01:35:48,110
Like the face just looks a little bit off from being like a panther.

2237
01:35:51,670 --> 01:35:52,670
What do we got?

2238
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,490
I can buy more Blorb.

2239
01:35:58,810 --> 01:36:00,050
That's always a good thing.

2240
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:00,630
Oh!

2241
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:02,270
Porb.

2242
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:03,210
Excuse me.

2243
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,530
Are we able to detrate?

2244
01:36:06,290 --> 01:36:08,410
Wait, it won't let me go to skills at all.

2245
01:36:12,330 --> 01:36:13,310
I'll buy Blorb.

2246
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:17,390
And I buy Porb.

2247
01:36:20,990 --> 01:36:24,650
And I buy more Blorb.

2248
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,540
Skills are locked on the first mission.

2249
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:32,120
Got it.

2250
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:37,440
Okay.

2251
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:39,040
Well, here we go.

2252
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,120
Exciting.

2253
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:48,970
He's so...

2254
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:54,390
All right, buddy.

2255
01:36:56,170 --> 01:36:57,050
Oh, okay.

2256
01:36:57,130 --> 01:36:57,690
Nothing over here.

2257
01:36:57,870 --> 01:36:58,010
Wait.

2258
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:58,710
How do I...

2259
01:36:58,710 --> 01:36:59,170
Oh gosh.

2260
01:36:59,290 --> 01:36:59,690
The camera.

2261
01:37:02,290 --> 01:37:03,350
I can't do anything.

2262
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:04,350
It won't even let me attack.

2263
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:05,070
It won't let me do anything.

2264
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:08,010
Okay.

2265
01:37:08,930 --> 01:37:09,590
I can't...

2266
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:10,410
I can jump.

2267
01:37:10,410 --> 01:37:10,530
Oh.

2268
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:16,950
We got a big old butt here.

2269
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:18,690
Oh, geniuses.

2270
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:19,450
Be careful.

2271
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:19,870
Yeah.

2272
01:37:20,050 --> 01:37:20,730
No shit, Shirley.

2273
01:37:20,970 --> 01:37:21,370
Ain't that right, D?

2274
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:23,090
I mean, you are fragile at the moment.

2275
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:24,250
Wouldn't take much to my...

2276
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:25,890
This is like Timon and Pumbaa.

2277
01:37:26,170 --> 01:37:27,310
I'm just saying, running away is okay.

2278
01:37:27,570 --> 01:37:29,030
It's always okay to run away.

2279
01:37:29,130 --> 01:37:29,850
If you're not at point.

2280
01:37:29,990 --> 01:37:33,910
He who desires but act not breeds pestilence.

2281
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:36,670
So it is written.

2282
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,150
Okay, Shakespeare.

2283
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:40,490
Just remember this.

2284
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:43,010
You and I like to exist.

2285
01:37:43,010 --> 01:37:44,490
So get rid of those demons quick.

2286
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:45,850
Cause killing them in my stick.

2287
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:47,130
He's rhyming.

2288
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,490
He's gonna rap that.

2289
01:37:48,970 --> 01:37:49,010
This guy is whack.

2290
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:51,770
Emo poetry.

2291
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:53,890
Okay, so what do we do?

2292
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,170
Attack with Y.

2293
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:56,770
After summoning Shadow.

2294
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:59,890
Press Y to make him perform a close range attack.

2295
01:38:05,170 --> 01:38:05,750
Oh.

2296
01:38:06,190 --> 01:38:07,450
And I get to just...

2297
01:38:07,450 --> 01:38:08,170
Do nothing?

2298
01:38:09,950 --> 01:38:10,530
Press...

2299
01:38:10,530 --> 01:38:13,650
Press B close to a dying enemy.

2300
01:38:14,710 --> 01:38:16,930
Shadow can't finish off dying enemies.

2301
01:38:17,110 --> 01:38:17,810
We have to do...

2302
01:38:17,810 --> 01:38:18,630
Oh, I have to do that.

2303
01:38:20,890 --> 01:38:22,110
Oh, like this guy.

2304
01:38:30,290 --> 01:38:32,430
Slice and dice baby.

2305
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:34,730
Come here.

2306
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:38,430
Oh, interesting.

2307
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:40,370
Oh, oh.

2308
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,870
After summoning Griffin.

2309
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:45,950
Press X to make him perform.

2310
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:46,850
Okay, so he's...

2311
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:47,550
He's our gun.

2312
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:48,610
Interesting.

2313
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:49,290
Go.

2314
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:57,860
Beep beep beep beep beep beep boop boop boop boop.

2315
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,860
And I press...

2316
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:06,120
Press RB...

2317
01:39:06,120 --> 01:39:07,480
To dodge?

2318
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:07,840
Okay.

2319
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:07,940
Okay.

2320
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:20,950
Interesting.

2321
01:39:22,090 --> 01:39:23,470
V has the best taunts?

2322
01:39:23,690 --> 01:39:24,010
Oh, yeah.

2323
01:39:24,670 --> 01:39:25,990
What is that graffiti?

2324
01:39:36,850 --> 01:39:38,790
You make me laugh.

2325
01:39:39,090 --> 01:39:40,510
Oh my god.

2326
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:47,600
Would you prefer panther to grab things?

2327
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:48,360
I don't know what.

2328
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:51,220
So, so I can just have him.

2329
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:52,620
Oh, neat.

2330
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:54,860
Oh, it's weird.

2331
01:39:55,360 --> 01:39:56,820
I don't know how to feel about it.

2332
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:00,800
Okay.

2333
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:04,540
It's weird not being able to control it like myself, in a way.

2334
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,160
I am so alone.

2335
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:08,120
The apocalypse has come.

2336
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,580
And so have I.

2337
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:10,740
What does that say?

2338
01:40:10,860 --> 01:40:11,880
Lady was here.

2339
01:40:14,740 --> 01:40:16,280
He's so emo.

2340
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:17,720
You guys don't laugh like that?

2341
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:25,420
If I press B up by it, can I then... Like, this one?

2342
01:40:26,380 --> 01:40:28,040
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

2343
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:29,460
That's not so bad, though.

2344
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,610
Controlling our little cat.

2345
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:39,070
Oh.

2346
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:41,190
The bird can't aim.

2347
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:43,470
The bird can't aim.

2348
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:47,510
Oh, wait!

2349
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:48,910
Oh my gosh!

2350
01:40:49,130 --> 01:40:50,150
We're... We're watching!

2351
01:40:50,490 --> 01:40:51,790
The other side!

2352
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:57,740
Hi, Nieru!

2353
01:40:58,420 --> 01:40:58,920
Hi!

2354
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:00,640
Hi!

2355
01:41:02,780 --> 01:41:03,920
That's me!

2356
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:04,920
Minto Gaming!

2357
01:41:08,740 --> 01:41:09,920
Wait a second.

2358
01:41:12,780 --> 01:41:13,780
Nieru, where are you?

2359
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:14,720
Wait, wait, wait.

2360
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:15,880
Where is he?

2361
01:41:16,140 --> 01:41:17,180
Still... Oh, there he is!

2362
01:41:18,640 --> 01:41:21,680
What if it was actually showing, like, playing my...

2363
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:23,600
Like, my data, you know?

2364
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:24,600
Wait, is it?

2365
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:28,480
Wait.

2366
01:41:29,060 --> 01:41:29,420
Hi!

2367
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:30,980
Wait, is it?

2368
01:41:31,060 --> 01:41:31,900
It is!

2369
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,960
Is that why I look so st...

2370
01:41:38,530 --> 01:41:40,650
This is what I look like!

2371
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:44,510
Wait!

2372
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:50,100
This is too funny!

2373
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:53,100
Are you gonna see me dance?

2374
01:41:56,140 --> 01:41:57,780
Wait, I can taunt him?

2375
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:00,820
Starring Mid Phantom!

2376
01:42:00,980 --> 01:42:01,420
That's me!

2377
01:42:01,640 --> 01:42:02,660
Wait, I'm in the game!

2378
01:42:08,330 --> 01:42:09,850
This is so funny!

2379
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:12,950
I'm in the game!

2380
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,400
Come here.

2381
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:18,800
Kitty, kitty.

2382
01:42:27,700 --> 01:42:28,140
Uh...

2383
01:42:28,140 --> 01:42:29,080
How do I...

2384
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:29,320
Hello?

2385
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:33,280
Is there, like, anything...

2386
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:35,260
Like, how do I make the cat jump?

2387
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:36,060
Oh!

2388
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:36,900
He can do that!

2389
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:37,560
Okay, okay.

2390
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:38,840
Wait.

2391
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:41,700
Move...

2392
01:42:41,700 --> 01:42:44,380
Move your riot to a locked-on target in an instant.

2393
01:42:44,780 --> 01:42:44,960
Oh!

2394
01:42:45,260 --> 01:42:45,620
Okay, okay.

2395
01:42:55,620 --> 01:42:56,060
Run!

2396
01:42:56,280 --> 01:42:56,300
Run!

2397
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:57,380
Thank you so much for the 20th!

2398
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:58,060
And thank you!

2399
01:42:59,780 --> 01:43:00,220
Wow!

2400
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:01,860
This is so strange!

2401
01:43:03,460 --> 01:43:07,980
I don't think I hate it so far, but it's definitely gonna take some getting used to.

2402
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,040
Where am I?

2403
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:12,240
Nero!

2404
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:14,840
Watashi!

2405
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:15,880
Hahaha!

2406
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:18,460
Oh!

2407
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:19,760
I need you!

2408
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:22,220
Slice it!

2409
01:43:22,820 --> 01:43:23,440
Nice!

2410
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:24,080
Good job!

2411
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:36,580
Oh!

2412
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,080
Wait!

2413
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:38,100
I think this one's timed, no?

2414
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:39,320
Okay.

2415
01:43:40,580 --> 01:43:41,940
Big roar, but yeah.

2416
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,740
This one's timed.

2417
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:48,580
It's your turn.

2418
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:50,440
At your pleasure.

2419
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:51,420
Gouge it!

2420
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:57,120
Gouge it!

2421
01:43:57,520 --> 01:43:58,020
Gouge it!

2422
01:43:58,440 --> 01:43:59,100
Gouge it!

2423
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:03,610
At your pleasure.

2424
01:44:03,610 --> 01:44:04,350
Ah!

2425
01:44:07,410 --> 01:44:07,890
Oh!

2426
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:08,370
Oh!

2427
01:44:11,090 --> 01:44:11,870
Spam both.

2428
01:44:12,150 --> 01:44:13,730
Oh, I guess you can do that, huh?

2429
01:44:14,470 --> 01:44:15,270
I was...

2430
01:44:15,270 --> 01:44:16,570
I was really mashing it.

2431
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:17,150
I was like this.

2432
01:44:17,330 --> 01:44:18,150
I was like this.

2433
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:20,810
I was like this, you guys.

2434
01:44:22,450 --> 01:44:26,030
My playthrough, I felt that V was pretty easy to get S-style ranking and above.

2435
01:44:26,470 --> 01:44:26,750
Oh!

2436
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:27,690
I see.

2437
01:44:28,350 --> 01:44:29,130
Oh well.

2438
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:33,870
I was mashing, smashing there, guys.

2439
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:36,710
What's gonna ambush me here?

2440
01:44:36,850 --> 01:44:36,990
Oh!

2441
01:44:37,350 --> 01:44:38,130
Wait, I see them.

2442
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:39,030
They're napping!

2443
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:41,490
Can you still see me?

2444
01:44:44,170 --> 01:44:46,070
I wish I could've watched the whole thing.

2445
01:44:48,950 --> 01:44:49,390
Uh...

2446
01:44:49,390 --> 01:44:49,890
Go get them!

2447
01:44:51,770 --> 01:44:52,210
Oh.

2448
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:52,930
Go get them!

2449
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:54,150
Look, they're having a little meeting.

2450
01:44:59,030 --> 01:44:59,470
Woohoo!

2451
01:45:00,610 --> 01:45:00,910
Me!

2452
01:45:01,170 --> 01:45:01,550
Woohoo!

2453
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:02,170
Oh my god!

2454
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:02,590
Wait.

2455
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:04,990
Wait.

2456
01:45:04,990 --> 01:45:05,970
Go, go, go get him.

2457
01:45:06,670 --> 01:45:07,730
Yeah, go get him.

2458
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:08,530
Go get him, tiger.

2459
01:45:08,970 --> 01:45:11,750
Landing blow on enemies or taking damage will fill the devil trigger.

2460
01:45:13,890 --> 01:45:16,470
Press LB when DT gauge is at level 3.

2461
01:45:18,150 --> 01:45:19,070
Summon Nightmare!

2462
01:45:20,370 --> 01:45:20,750
Wait.

2463
01:45:21,090 --> 01:45:22,270
This guy is not close.

2464
01:45:24,830 --> 01:45:25,290
Wow!

2465
01:45:30,680 --> 01:45:31,460
Look at him doing!

2466
01:45:31,660 --> 01:45:32,300
It's just chilling.

2467
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:32,720
jeszcze chillin' there.

2468
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:33,860
Yeah!

2469
01:45:35,740 --> 01:45:36,560
What does he do?

2470
01:45:50,090 --> 01:45:51,670
Smash, smash, smash, smash, smash!

2471
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:56,010
Smash... Put the best cash... oh, nope, not yet.

2472
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:58,870
Smash, Smash, Smash, Smash, Smash, Smash,

2473
01:46:19,630 --> 01:46:23,950
Wow, it really is easier to get.

2474
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:25,670
Big rank.

2475
01:46:26,650 --> 01:46:27,370
Easy.

2476
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:32,370
I was just using two fingers at once.

2477
01:46:34,090 --> 01:46:35,130
Oh, thank you.

2478
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:36,950
I was just smash-mashing.

2479
01:46:37,710 --> 01:46:38,810
Smash-mashing.

2480
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:42,590
The smash-slinging.

2481
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:45,810
The blast-slinging.

2482
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:49,190
Oh, wait.

2483
01:46:49,330 --> 01:46:50,070
I think I see something.

2484
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:51,570
A garb.

2485
01:46:52,010 --> 01:46:53,350
A garb.

2486
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:58,030
Does Nightmare remind me of something?

2487
01:47:01,070 --> 01:47:02,070
The big boy?

2488
01:47:06,490 --> 01:47:09,210
Maybe, but I can't put my finger on it.

2489
01:47:09,650 --> 01:47:10,450
What is he?

2490
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:12,730
Unless that's a spoiler.

2491
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,650
Then don't spoil.

2492
01:47:14,770 --> 01:47:16,370
Maybe I'll figure it out.

2493
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:17,890
In the future.

2494
01:47:21,090 --> 01:47:22,130
Shit for gore.

2495
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,710
I did.

2496
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:26,870
One of the fun things about music and taunt him.

2497
01:47:27,090 --> 01:47:27,230
Wait.

2498
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:29,310
Or... Oh.

2499
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:32,270
Smelly.

2500
01:47:33,650 --> 01:47:34,570
You stink.

2501
01:47:34,750 --> 01:47:35,730
I have to keep going.

2502
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:36,250
Oh.

2503
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:38,390
That doesn't seem like a taunt.

2504
01:47:38,650 --> 01:47:40,130
That seems like a... Are you okay, buddy?

2505
01:47:40,130 --> 01:47:42,690
I would feel... I would feel bad for him.

2506
01:47:43,650 --> 01:47:44,390
It's pro-kay.

2507
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:52,090
Where are you, Vito?

2508
01:47:52,430 --> 01:47:52,910
Vito?

2509
01:47:53,250 --> 01:47:53,630
Vito?

2510
01:47:54,730 --> 01:47:55,890
Are you... Oh.

2511
01:47:56,610 --> 01:47:57,150
Stalemate.

2512
01:47:57,250 --> 01:48:00,010
Your demon pets will stop moving if they take too much damage.

2513
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:02,550
Keep an eye on their gauges in the upper left corner of the screen.

2514
01:48:02,850 --> 01:48:04,550
See how much vitality they have left.

2515
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:08,170
Vito's demons recover from stalemate by themselves over time.

2516
01:48:08,330 --> 01:48:11,990
You can speed up their recovery by moving Vito close to them.

2517
01:48:12,110 --> 01:48:12,450
What?

2518
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,730
Nightmare can interact with the environment, too.

2519
01:48:15,790 --> 01:48:18,710
In this level, there are a few secrets by summoning him in other fights.

2520
01:48:19,290 --> 01:48:19,470
Cool.

2521
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:21,770
Nightmare can break walls.

2522
01:48:22,010 --> 01:48:22,230
Oh!

2523
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:23,390
Thank you, guys.

2524
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:27,850
Vito's gameplay is great because he can taunt and enjoy his theme while just smashing some buttons.

2525
01:48:27,850 --> 01:48:28,770
It makes my brain happy.

2526
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:29,270
Yeah!

2527
01:48:29,650 --> 01:48:31,090
It's very, like, hands-off.

2528
01:48:31,390 --> 01:48:34,770
Well, I'm guessing, like, I'm just... I'm letting all the other animals do the work.

2529
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:37,050
It's pretty nice.

2530
01:48:37,210 --> 01:48:38,210
I'm not gonna lie.

2531
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:42,430
Basically, they can die.

2532
01:48:42,730 --> 01:48:43,510
But how do... Wait.

2533
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:44,390
Oh!

2534
01:48:44,510 --> 01:48:44,650
No!

2535
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:45,510
That's not who I meant to...

2536
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:48,210
Sorry.

2537
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:55,670
How do I see their... Oh, is...

2538
01:48:55,670 --> 01:48:57,650
Here, you go... You come back, buddy.

2539
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:58,430
My bad.

2540
01:48:59,030 --> 01:49:02,690
When they said upper left, that's... My brain was, like, left button.

2541
01:49:03,090 --> 01:49:05,090
Just to give you an idea of what...

2542
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:07,030
This... That's how my brain works sometimes, you guys.

2543
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:07,490
I'm sorry.

2544
01:49:07,990 --> 01:49:08,750
Wait, what's that?

2545
01:49:11,650 --> 01:49:12,410
What?

2546
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:12,850
Oof!

2547
01:49:13,850 --> 01:49:14,350
Ma,

2548
01:49:18,890 --> 01:49:20,550
what big ears you have.

2549
01:49:20,990 --> 01:49:23,490
Grandma, what big eyes you have.

2550
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:26,850
Grandma, what big noise you have.

2551
01:49:26,850 --> 01:49:27,010
Grandma, what big noise you have.

2552
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:29,770
Why... Why is it a cube?

2553
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:32,890
He's not an orb at all.

2554
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:37,790
That's so funny.

2555
01:49:38,170 --> 01:49:38,450
Okay.

2556
01:49:42,210 --> 01:49:43,250
Get his ass!

2557
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:43,970
Get his ass!

2558
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:49,060
Good job, team.

2559
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:51,400
Uh-oh.

2560
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:53,300
Uh-oh.

2561
01:49:59,940 --> 01:50:01,120
Run, Vee, run!

2562
01:50:01,640 --> 01:50:05,930
Good thing we've got a bird to help us.

2563
01:50:12,510 --> 01:50:14,330
And a gorb right behind us.

2564
01:50:14,410 --> 01:50:17,190
Wow, this game is really generous with the gorbs.

2565
01:50:24,590 --> 01:50:28,650
And like I said, I got one earlier for just opening up the game.

2566
01:50:28,910 --> 01:50:30,230
There's login bonuses.

2567
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:33,170
Where am I?

2568
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:35,570
I'm lost.

2569
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:37,790
Probably stuck over there.

2570
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:40,590
Trying to figure out how to get the big tree.

2571
01:50:44,270 --> 01:50:46,130
They do hand them out like candy.

2572
01:50:46,610 --> 01:50:47,290
What's this?

2573
01:50:47,290 --> 01:50:49,910
I will not allow him to gain any more power.

2574
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:52,570
Oh, I gotta put the little... the little stinker in there.

2575
01:50:53,210 --> 01:50:54,210
I gotta do that.

2576
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:57,450
Nice.

2577
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:01,090
The little... yeah, the little bug guy.

2578
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,470
What are you?

2579
01:51:04,110 --> 01:51:05,690
Oh, it's a poor fragment.

2580
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:06,550
Oh my gosh.

2581
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:09,390
You guys, I learned something the other day.

2582
01:51:10,330 --> 01:51:12,190
Now I can't remember what it's called.

2583
01:51:12,330 --> 01:51:13,150
It starts with a T.

2584
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:15,590
So basically...

2585
01:51:15,590 --> 01:51:16,190
So basically...

2586
01:51:16,570 --> 01:51:17,870
This is kind of disturbing.

2587
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:22,530
This is a little... this is a little freaky, okay?

2588
01:51:22,650 --> 01:51:25,570
This is like... this is... this is some freaky stuff, okay?

2589
01:51:25,730 --> 01:51:27,150
Like actually freaky.

2590
01:51:28,130 --> 01:51:29,130
Transformers, I wish.

2591
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:31,450
So...

2592
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:34,450
Oh my gosh!

2593
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:35,530
Skewer, you got it!

2594
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:36,910
Yes, it's the teratoma!

2595
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,430
So I learned about that the other day.

2596
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:40,090
So...

2597
01:51:40,090 --> 01:51:41,390
Sometimes...

2598
01:51:42,250 --> 01:51:42,610
Ladies...

2599
01:51:42,610 --> 01:51:45,610
Can have a teratoma form...

2600
01:51:45,610 --> 01:51:47,670
On their ovaries.

2601
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,110
And basically...

2602
01:51:49,110 --> 01:51:51,450
What it is, it's like...

2603
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:53,370
It's like a benign...

2604
01:51:53,370 --> 01:51:55,290
Usually it's benign, but it's a tumor.

2605
01:51:56,470 --> 01:51:57,190
And...

2606
01:51:57,190 --> 01:51:59,510
It's not just any kind of tumor.

2607
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:02,270
What it is, is it's a tumor that...

2608
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:03,450
It grows hair...

2609
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:05,450
And it has teeth...

2610
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:07,710
And sometimes it has...

2611
01:52:07,710 --> 01:52:08,330
Eyeballs!

2612
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:09,650
And...

2613
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:10,330
And...

2614
01:52:10,330 --> 01:52:11,890
It kind of looks like this.

2615
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:15,070
It

2616
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:21,430
kind of looks like this borb!

2617
01:52:24,270 --> 01:52:25,690
I'm sorry, eyeballs?

2618
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:26,170
Yeah!

2619
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:27,850
Isn't that freaky?

2620
01:52:29,310 --> 01:52:30,210
I don't...

2621
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:31,630
I didn't look into how...

2622
01:52:31,630 --> 01:52:33,190
They form...

2623
01:52:33,190 --> 01:52:34,030
But like...

2624
01:52:34,370 --> 01:52:35,690
What if it's like...

2625
01:52:35,690 --> 01:52:38,130
You were supposed to have like a...

2626
01:52:38,130 --> 01:52:38,830
What if it's...

2627
01:52:38,830 --> 01:52:42,090
What if it's like if you were supposed to have a twin and you ate it?

2628
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:43,330
And then...

2629
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:45,630
It was always in you.

2630
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:46,850
And then it grew into...

2631
01:52:47,630 --> 01:52:48,590
A teratoma!

2632
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:52,490
I do not believe that it can have eyes.

2633
01:52:52,510 --> 01:52:53,510
I'm telling the truth!

2634
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:55,770
I'm telling the gosh darn truth!

2635
01:53:01,390 --> 01:53:02,790
It's so freaky!

2636
01:53:03,110 --> 01:53:04,530
Shiri me real!

2637
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:05,090
No!

2638
01:53:05,910 --> 01:53:07,630
Oh my gosh, do you guys know Shiri me?

2639
01:53:07,890 --> 01:53:09,850
Basically, it's a Japanese yokai.

2640
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:12,130
And it's literally in the name.

2641
01:53:12,750 --> 01:53:13,190
Shiri...

2642
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:14,410
Oshiri is butt.

2643
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:16,370
And then me is eye.

2644
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:17,050
It's a yokai.

2645
01:53:17,050 --> 01:53:19,850
And it's a yokai that has a butt...

2646
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:21,290
And where the butthole is...

2647
01:53:21,290 --> 01:53:22,510
Is it's eyeball!

2648
01:53:25,410 --> 01:53:25,930
Why?

2649
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:26,310
Why?

2650
01:53:26,530 --> 01:53:26,670
Why?

2651
01:53:27,130 --> 01:53:27,150
Why?

2652
01:53:27,390 --> 01:53:29,610
There are many evil twin horror movies.

2653
01:53:29,730 --> 01:53:30,190
Oh really?

2654
01:53:33,010 --> 01:53:36,010
Basically, a teratoma is a tumor with types of cells that shouldn't be there.

2655
01:53:36,150 --> 01:53:39,210
Every type of cell starts out as the same thing as how it happened.

2656
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,070
That's crazy!

2657
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,590
Trying to eat my steak.

2658
01:53:43,830 --> 01:53:44,570
Don't worry!

2659
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:46,810
That's the plot of Malignant.

2660
01:53:47,190 --> 01:53:47,590
Malignant.

2661
01:53:47,810 --> 01:53:48,230
Oh really?

2662
01:53:48,230 --> 01:53:49,150
I can't...

2663
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:51,690
I believe that there would be horror movies based around it.

2664
01:53:51,810 --> 01:53:55,290
Because in of itself, it's a horror movie, no?

2665
01:53:57,090 --> 01:53:58,430
You know that saying?

2666
01:53:58,650 --> 01:54:01,270
Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.

2667
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:08,390
I just googled it.

2668
01:54:08,570 --> 01:54:09,950
Well now you learned something today.

2669
01:54:10,190 --> 01:54:12,570
So if anybody is ever just like...

2670
01:54:12,570 --> 01:54:14,470
Oh no, I have a teratoma.

2671
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:16,190
You'd be like...

2672
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:16,450
Ew!

2673
01:54:16,650 --> 01:54:17,810
Oh you...

2674
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:18,950
Freak of nature!

2675
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:20,190
You...

2676
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:20,470
Are...

2677
01:54:20,470 --> 01:54:21,370
So disgusting!

2678
01:54:22,070 --> 01:54:22,990
You could say...

2679
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:23,410
You could...

2680
01:54:23,410 --> 01:54:24,110
Then they'll be like...

2681
01:54:24,110 --> 01:54:25,590
How do you know what that is?

2682
01:54:33,010 --> 01:54:34,170
That's rude, Minto.

2683
01:54:34,370 --> 01:54:34,730
You're right.

2684
01:54:34,790 --> 01:54:36,310
I'm telling you not to say that.

2685
01:54:37,010 --> 01:54:38,690
I was enjoying my food!

2686
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,790
Well...

2687
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:40,690
I'm sorry.

2688
01:54:40,950 --> 01:54:42,790
I learned that literally like yesterday.

2689
01:54:43,130 --> 01:54:44,010
And then that...

2690
01:54:45,370 --> 01:54:46,490
That little guy...

2691
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:47,070
The little porb...

2692
01:54:47,950 --> 01:54:49,110
Reminded me of it.

2693
01:54:50,350 --> 01:54:52,210
You can blame the porb, okay?

2694
01:54:52,930 --> 01:54:53,670
What's this?

2695
01:54:55,370 --> 01:54:55,890
Oh!

2696
01:54:57,850 --> 01:54:58,370
A...

2697
01:54:58,910 --> 01:54:59,430
Warb...

2698
01:54:59,430 --> 01:54:59,630
Tree.

2699
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:00,790
Wait!

2700
01:55:00,970 --> 01:55:01,750
How do I get that?

2701
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:03,710
Get that!

2702
01:55:03,970 --> 01:55:04,910
Now get to work!

2703
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:05,750
Oh!

2704
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:06,130
No!

2705
01:55:06,470 --> 01:55:06,710
No!

2706
01:55:06,890 --> 01:55:07,210
Wait!

2707
01:55:08,590 --> 01:55:09,110
Huh?

2708
01:55:09,450 --> 01:55:09,870
Oh!

2709
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:10,930
That's just the residue.

2710
01:55:11,250 --> 01:55:11,530
Okay.

2711
01:55:14,610 --> 01:55:15,290
Aha!

2712
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:16,710
Nice!

2713
01:55:17,570 --> 01:55:17,970
Alright.

2714
01:55:19,910 --> 01:55:20,590
Nope.

2715
01:55:21,070 --> 01:55:21,710
Get me out of here.

2716
01:55:23,710 --> 01:55:24,390
Mmm...

2717
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:24,810
I need...

2718
01:55:27,070 --> 01:55:27,530
Crash.

2719
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:30,290
Can I go through here?

2720
01:55:30,870 --> 01:55:31,030
No?

2721
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:32,710
The bug!

2722
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:33,710
I'm looking for it!

2723
01:55:33,810 --> 01:55:34,830
I'm looking for it!

2724
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:42,010
During my med studies, I learned about teratomas due to them being made up...

2725
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:45,090
Made up of stem cells, which could be studied...

2726
01:55:45,090 --> 01:55:45,940
Learned about cellular regeneration.

2727
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:47,070
Yeah!

2728
01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:48,750
It's very fascinating...

2729
01:55:50,110 --> 01:55:52,010
That it can even happen at all.

2730
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:55,450
The body...

2731
01:55:55,450 --> 01:55:57,190
The human body is...

2732
01:55:57,190 --> 01:55:58,190
Kinda crazy.

2733
01:55:58,910 --> 01:55:59,150
What?

2734
01:55:59,230 --> 01:55:59,750
You saw the bug?

2735
01:55:59,830 --> 01:56:00,070
I did?

2736
01:56:00,570 --> 01:56:02,070
Wait, what do you mean I saw the bug?

2737
01:56:02,310 --> 01:56:02,970
Where was it?

2738
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:06,370
Where was the bug?

2739
01:56:09,470 --> 01:56:10,370
Where was the bug?

2740
01:56:13,650 --> 01:56:15,930
Or wait, do I grab him from the yellow?

2741
01:56:16,110 --> 01:56:17,750
I thought I placed it inside the yellow.

2742
01:56:18,750 --> 01:56:19,370
Oh!

2743
01:56:24,410 --> 01:56:25,210
Gimme that.

2744
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,470
This one's just for fun.

2745
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:30,110
Thank you!

2746
01:56:30,670 --> 01:56:31,550
Thank you so much!

2747
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:46,400
I'm spamming both at once?

2748
01:56:51,070 --> 01:56:52,270
Wait, what's that?

2749
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:54,490
Oh.

2750
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,540
What is this thing?

2751
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,160
I lost Griffith!

2752
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:06,520
Oh!

2753
01:57:06,720 --> 01:57:07,040
I see!

2754
01:57:10,780 --> 01:57:11,460
Oh wow!

2755
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,480
They have...

2756
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:12,940
Low...

2757
01:57:13,780 --> 01:57:14,600
Health then.

2758
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:15,140
Okay.

2759
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:16,880
Oh, I see their health now.

2760
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:23,690
There we go.

2761
01:57:24,850 --> 01:57:25,550
Oh, oh.

2762
01:57:25,730 --> 01:57:26,150
Not yet.

2763
01:57:26,390 --> 01:57:27,330
Not close enough.

2764
01:57:27,590 --> 01:57:28,070
There we go.

2765
01:57:28,070 --> 01:57:28,550
Okay.

2766
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:30,670
Okie dokie.

2767
01:57:30,890 --> 01:57:31,370
Okie dokie.

2768
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:33,450
Still getting used to it.

2769
01:57:33,610 --> 01:57:34,570
So far I'm just like...

2770
01:57:34,570 --> 01:57:35,130
I'm just spamming.

2771
01:57:35,950 --> 01:57:36,910
X and Y.

2772
01:57:38,850 --> 01:57:40,390
I'm like barely even looking.

2773
01:57:40,570 --> 01:57:40,950
Alrighty.

2774
01:57:41,510 --> 01:57:42,490
We got it.

2775
01:57:42,590 --> 01:57:43,450
We got our little bug.

2776
01:57:43,810 --> 01:57:44,910
Our little buggy boy.

2777
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:49,230
If your bones are damp.

2778
01:57:49,230 --> 01:57:50,810
I don't think about that actually.

2779
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:55,370
I mean, I don't have bones.

2780
01:57:56,190 --> 01:57:57,910
Of ectoplasm.

2781
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:01,570
Kingdom.

2782
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:04,290
This is my...

2783
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:04,510
Oop.

2784
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:05,530
Kingdom.

2785
01:58:06,710 --> 01:58:08,150
This is my kingdom.

2786
01:58:08,150 --> 01:58:08,490
Kingdom.

2787
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:10,110
The people.

2788
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:11,370
The people.

2789
01:58:11,550 --> 01:58:11,850
The people.

2790
01:58:15,630 --> 01:58:16,250
Ectoplasm.

2791
01:58:16,270 --> 01:58:16,350
Oh.

2792
01:58:16,850 --> 01:58:16,950
Ah.

2793
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:23,810
Use one stock of DT gauge to make Shadow and Griffin attack foes with increased strength for a set time.

2794
01:58:23,950 --> 01:58:25,270
Execute the same command again.

2795
01:58:25,510 --> 01:58:28,410
Will extend attack time with the cost of more DT gauge.

2796
01:58:29,310 --> 01:58:29,930
Interesting.

2797
01:58:30,950 --> 01:58:32,250
So far nice.

2798
01:58:34,010 --> 01:58:34,630
Whoa.

2799
01:58:34,910 --> 01:58:35,290
Whoa.

2800
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:36,070
Whoa.

2801
01:58:36,070 --> 01:58:36,190
Whoa.

2802
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:36,990
Whoa.

2803
01:58:37,410 --> 01:58:38,050
Wait.

2804
01:58:38,550 --> 01:58:39,590
Did I do it right?

2805
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:51,770
Gimme that.

2806
01:58:59,120 --> 01:59:01,740
Fill the Ect gauge during battle.

2807
01:59:02,660 --> 01:59:03,500
RT.

2808
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:08,200
I'm not reading.

2809
01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:17,480
Oh my god.

2810
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:24,590
Oh no my guys.

2811
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:25,790
I'm reading.

2812
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:28,490
Ouch.

2813
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:29,510
I'm not reading.

2814
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:31,310
You can read and walk?

2815
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:31,870
Oh, okay.

2816
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:43,040
Oh my god.

2817
01:59:46,580 --> 01:59:47,360
Oh, that's right.

2818
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:48,960
I have to...

2819
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:50,940
Whoa.

2820
01:59:51,540 --> 01:59:52,240
Oh my god.

2821
01:59:52,360 --> 01:59:52,640
Whoa.

2822
01:59:52,640 --> 01:59:52,700
Whoa.

2823
01:59:53,020 --> 01:59:53,820
Oh my god.

2824
01:59:54,240 --> 01:59:55,340
Oh my god.

2825
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:56,100
Whoa.

2826
01:59:59,220 --> 01:59:59,880
Whoa.

2827
02:00:00,940 --> 02:00:02,520
Smoke and sexy style.

2828
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:09,780
If any of your animals allows their health, go into stalemate and you have devil trigger activate.

2829
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:12,300
Devil trigger will instantly revive them.

2830
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:13,180
Okay, okay.

2831
02:00:14,280 --> 02:00:15,260
Wow wee.

2832
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,440
Oh, my earnings.

2833
02:00:20,580 --> 02:00:21,640
Grab my money.

2834
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:25,080
Can I go in here?

2835
02:00:27,020 --> 02:00:28,000
Oh, I can.

2836
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:28,760
Haha.

2837
02:00:29,480 --> 02:00:31,560
Human blood is the source of his strength.

2838
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:34,080
I must cut off his supply.

2839
02:00:35,260 --> 02:00:35,860
Okay.

2840
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:39,540
I mean, there's only so many humans now.

2841
02:00:41,160 --> 02:00:44,000
My cat is back home after having me in the pet hospital.

2842
02:00:44,460 --> 02:00:46,700
Streams were a bit comfort during those nerve-wracking days.

2843
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:49,040
I'm glad your cat's okay.

2844
02:00:49,040 --> 02:00:49,220
Yay!

2845
02:00:51,900 --> 02:00:53,500
So, can I read this anytime?

2846
02:00:53,900 --> 02:00:54,360
Oh my god.

2847
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:58,940
The angel that presided on my birth said little creature formed of joy and mirth.

2848
02:00:58,980 --> 02:01:01,540
Go love without the help of anything on earth.

2849
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:03,780
I was surprised.

2850
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:09,200
To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower.

2851
02:01:09,600 --> 02:01:13,660
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand and eternity in an hour.

2852
02:01:16,340 --> 02:01:16,860
So...

2853
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:17,560
Please stop reading.

2854
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:18,160
Stop it.

2855
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:19,200
Stop reading.

2856
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:21,420
What's up here?

2857
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:21,900
Oh!

2858
02:01:25,320 --> 02:01:25,840
Blar!

2859
02:01:27,080 --> 02:01:30,740
If V had an audio book, it's really terrible.

2860
02:01:32,300 --> 02:01:33,660
I would listen to it.

2861
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:37,000
I would listen to V's audio book.

2862
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:38,700
Wait, what's this?

2863
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:39,980
Oh.

2864
02:01:41,220 --> 02:01:43,320
I guess I could have gotten that myself, huh?

2865
02:01:43,660 --> 02:01:45,040
Oh, it's a...

2866
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,300
A...

2867
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:47,880
Warb tree.

2868
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:56,050
You gotta be careful!

2869
02:01:56,370 --> 02:01:56,630
You gotta...

2870
02:01:56,630 --> 02:01:56,770
Oh!

2871
02:01:57,110 --> 02:02:00,270
You gotta be careful!

2872
02:02:00,570 --> 02:02:01,270
You gotta be careful!

2873
02:02:07,510 --> 02:02:09,010
He's fine, everybody.

2874
02:02:09,610 --> 02:02:10,490
He's fine.

2875
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:14,330
How is it abuse?

2876
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:15,250
He's doing it himself.

2877
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:18,290
Okay, hold on.

2878
02:02:18,450 --> 02:02:19,790
So there's two ways we can go...

2879
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:20,630
Oh, I think...

2880
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:23,470
That probably leads to...

2881
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:25,070
Uh...

2882
02:02:25,070 --> 02:02:25,730
What's it called?

2883
02:02:26,590 --> 02:02:28,570
This probably leads to...

2884
02:02:28,570 --> 02:02:29,050
Around...

2885
02:02:29,190 --> 02:02:30,830
Like in an alleyway, I imagine.

2886
02:02:32,850 --> 02:02:33,810
Uh...

2887
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:34,730
Oh, it doesn't!

2888
02:02:34,830 --> 02:02:35,890
It's completely...

2889
02:02:36,570 --> 02:02:37,050
Different...

2890
02:02:37,050 --> 02:02:37,230
Area.

2891
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:38,670
Aha!

2892
02:02:39,330 --> 02:02:39,890
Okay.

2893
02:02:44,370 --> 02:02:46,450
We get another little guy.

2894
02:02:47,270 --> 02:02:48,070
Interesting.

2895
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:48,710
Okay.

2896
02:02:49,870 --> 02:02:50,430
We get another little guy.

2897
02:02:50,430 --> 02:02:50,750
We have a...

2898
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:52,450
Two Nidhogg hatchlings.

2899
02:02:53,730 --> 02:02:54,330
Oh!

2900
02:02:54,710 --> 02:02:55,150
Oh!

2901
02:02:55,310 --> 02:02:55,470
Oh!

2902
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:55,610
Okay.

2903
02:02:56,130 --> 02:02:56,550
Nevermind.

2904
02:02:56,550 --> 02:02:57,230
Thank you.

2905
02:02:58,650 --> 02:03:00,050
Uh...

2906
02:03:00,050 --> 02:03:02,170
Eraticate them all.

2907
02:03:02,370 --> 02:03:03,030
Rise.

2908
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:04,770
Beautiful.

2909
02:03:10,170 --> 02:03:13,490
Oh, my gosh...

2910
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:15,250
Holy cow.

2911
02:03:16,090 --> 02:03:17,170
Is that it?

2912
02:03:17,370 --> 02:03:17,470
Oh.

2913
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:27,710
Come on, get that guy!

2914
02:03:27,790 --> 02:03:28,250
Get that guy!

2915
02:03:29,510 --> 02:03:30,650
There he is.

2916
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:36,910
Pin him to the wall.

2917
02:03:44,570 --> 02:03:45,090
Wow!

2918
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:46,230
Taunt?

2919
02:03:46,390 --> 02:03:47,430
Oh, sorry guys.

2920
02:03:47,750 --> 02:03:48,110
I forget.

2921
02:03:49,950 --> 02:03:50,830
Sorry, sorry.

2922
02:03:51,750 --> 02:03:52,750
Oh, wait.

2923
02:03:53,050 --> 02:03:53,570
Did I get everything?

2924
02:03:56,910 --> 02:03:59,890
Let's go to the other side real quick.

2925
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:05,650
Taunt or read.

2926
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,910
Yeah, just so that we can get our DT back.

2927
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:15,210
Set out my birth said little creature formed of joy and mirth go love without the help of anything on Earth.

2928
02:04:17,350 --> 02:04:19,130
These rhymes are kinda.

2929
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:23,610
Kinda.

2930
02:04:31,430 --> 02:04:32,370
Thank you.

2931
02:04:32,370 --> 02:04:32,550
Yeah.

2932
02:04:33,350 --> 02:04:34,530
Yup, yup, yup, yup.

2933
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:36,090
Yup, yup, yup.

2934
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:38,030
Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.

2935
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:39,870
Oh!

2936
02:04:47,350 --> 02:04:47,850
Can I?

2937
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:49,710
But I can't read and attack, know?

2938
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:51,350
Like...

2939
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:53,110
It doesn't seem like I can do that.

2940
02:04:54,190 --> 02:04:56,670
Wait, is there any walls for me to break?

2941
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:58,990
Wait, can I break this?

2942
02:05:04,850 --> 02:05:05,850
Where did he come from?

2943
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:07,770
Oh, there he is.

2944
02:05:31,610 --> 02:05:32,950
I actually can't move.

2945
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:34,470
I actually can't move.

2946
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:43,100
Oh, my cat!

2947
02:05:44,260 --> 02:05:49,780
There's so much to keep track of.

2948
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,220
That's why it's...

2949
02:05:51,220 --> 02:05:52,800
Because they don't just fight on their own.

2950
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:53,860
You know?

2951
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:58,400
Almost.

2952
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,880
These milky barb audiobooks.

2953
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:09,480
I don't want that.

2954
02:06:09,800 --> 02:06:10,120
Oh, wait.

2955
02:06:10,260 --> 02:06:10,920
I got these guys.

2956
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:11,600
I gotta kill them.

2957
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:13,660
Come on!

2958
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:14,960
Come on!

2959
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:16,380
Yeah!

2960
02:06:16,920 --> 02:06:17,420
And you!

2961
02:06:17,900 --> 02:06:18,160
Yeah!

2962
02:06:18,820 --> 02:06:19,540
Oh, not yet.

2963
02:06:19,620 --> 02:06:19,940
Not yet.

2964
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:47,900
I

2965
02:06:51,380 --> 02:06:52,000
got it.

2966
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:52,580
Is that it?

2967
02:06:53,140 --> 02:06:53,380
Yeah!

2968
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:55,600
What the hell?

2969
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:08,470
Get it out of that.

2970
02:07:10,230 --> 02:07:12,210
That was like so cinematic.

2971
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:15,190
No, get that one up there.

2972
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:16,090
Little bird.

2973
02:07:16,310 --> 02:07:16,710
There you go.

2974
02:07:19,530 --> 02:07:21,230
That looks like a trap right there, no?

2975
02:07:23,310 --> 02:07:24,210
Because there's so many...

2976
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,750
Okay.

2977
02:07:28,530 --> 02:07:30,330
Wow, there's so much to explore around here.

2978
02:07:30,530 --> 02:07:30,870
Okay, okay.

2979
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:31,870
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

2980
02:07:33,570 --> 02:07:33,930
Cinema.

2981
02:07:34,630 --> 02:07:36,230
As he does an orchestra.

2982
02:07:36,490 --> 02:07:37,030
Woo!

2983
02:07:37,510 --> 02:07:38,210
I want that.

2984
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:42,330
So what's my...

2985
02:07:42,330 --> 02:07:42,650
Let's see.

2986
02:07:43,370 --> 02:07:44,010
Oh, my DT.

2987
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:45,290
You're itching to play.

2988
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:46,670
I can tell.

2989
02:07:46,850 --> 02:07:47,610
Is that like nothing?

2990
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:49,210
Oh my god!

2991
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,540
Aw, he wants out!

2992
02:07:58,420 --> 02:07:59,760
He wants to play.

2993
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:01,360
He wants to hang out.

2994
02:08:02,360 --> 02:08:03,480
He's so cute.

2995
02:08:03,480 --> 02:08:05,040
Okay, not that way.

2996
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:07,480
This looks like I could break it because of like the...

2997
02:08:08,540 --> 02:08:09,300
Wait a second.

2998
02:08:13,790 --> 02:08:14,650
What's the gold?

2999
02:08:14,770 --> 02:08:16,170
What's the gold on the ground floor?

3000
02:08:17,310 --> 02:08:18,190
You see that?

3001
02:08:18,590 --> 02:08:19,610
Is that because of...

3002
02:08:20,190 --> 02:08:20,870
This guy?

3003
02:08:22,590 --> 02:08:23,370
Secret mission?

3004
02:08:23,510 --> 02:08:24,330
Oh, that's right!

3005
02:08:25,250 --> 02:08:26,130
Oh, uh...

3006
02:08:26,630 --> 02:08:30,090
I don't remember what it was, but like where you have to stand for it.

3007
02:08:31,030 --> 02:08:31,470
Ah...

3008
02:08:33,150 --> 02:08:34,970
I don't remember what you have to do.

3009
02:08:36,110 --> 02:08:37,730
You like have to...

3010
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:44,360
Oh, there's more too.

3011
02:08:55,550 --> 02:08:57,290
Gotta look down at it.

3012
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:03,300
Isn't there like a place that you gotta...

3013
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:04,460
Stand though?

3014
02:09:04,700 --> 02:09:08,080
To then it like activates it and then you can move it to...

3015
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:09,340
I don't remember.

3016
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:16,880
Oh wait, there's even more of it there.

3017
02:09:17,120 --> 02:09:17,520
Wait...

3018
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:23,850
What are you doing?

3019
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:27,910
Not here.

3020
02:09:28,530 --> 02:09:30,690
Yeah, I think I can only do it from up above.

3021
02:09:31,190 --> 02:09:31,910
Okay, anyway.

3022
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:34,890
Break this door!

3023
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:37,650
Slice him.

3024
02:09:38,650 --> 02:09:39,170
Nevermind.

3025
02:09:39,450 --> 02:09:40,150
We're too weak.

3026
02:09:41,630 --> 02:09:44,490
I'm getting overwhelmed by where all to go to.

3027
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:47,250
I guess let's go back...

3028
02:09:47,950 --> 02:09:48,630
To...

3029
02:09:48,630 --> 02:09:49,070
To...

3030
02:09:49,070 --> 02:09:49,710
The other area.

3031
02:09:51,110 --> 02:09:52,350
Gotta backtrack.

3032
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:56,160
Oh...

3033
02:09:56,160 --> 02:09:56,920
That was here.

3034
02:09:58,780 --> 02:09:59,640
Hold on.

3035
02:09:59,820 --> 02:10:01,220
Let's go into here...

3036
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:01,760
Uh, first.

3037
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,480
Cause...

3038
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:05,180
Or...

3039
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,420
Did I explore everything in here?

3040
02:10:07,440 --> 02:10:08,100
I'm just making sure.

3041
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:13,300
If I explored everything.

3042
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:13,920
Cause I don't...

3043
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:14,420
Oh, see?

3044
02:10:14,620 --> 02:10:15,700
I didn't go over this way.

3045
02:10:17,580 --> 02:10:18,680
Or is this just a loop?

3046
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:22,320
Oh wait, maybe it's a loop.

3047
02:10:23,900 --> 02:10:24,540
OOI!

3048
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:25,240
OOI!

3049
02:10:25,440 --> 02:10:25,540
OOI!

3050
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:25,600
OOI!

3051
02:10:26,100 --> 02:10:26,740
OOI!

3052
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:50,440
OOI!

3053
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:52,680
I mostly got them.

3054
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:56,520
Press the left stick.

3055
02:10:56,600 --> 02:10:57,000
You're right!

3056
02:10:57,220 --> 02:10:58,200
It shows me where to go!

3057
02:10:59,300 --> 02:11:00,520
Does that say nerd?

3058
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:02,980
Uh...

3059
02:11:02,980 --> 02:11:03,960
Nero.

3060
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:04,160
Nero.

3061
02:11:11,960 --> 02:11:12,400
Okay.

3062
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:13,540
Go back.

3063
02:11:13,680 --> 02:11:13,960
Don't worry.

3064
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:14,660
I'm exploring.

3065
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:15,740
I'm exploring a little bit.

3066
02:11:15,940 --> 02:11:17,140
Before I do...

3067
02:11:17,820 --> 02:11:18,260
Stuff.

3068
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:20,180
Now, get to work.

3069
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:22,640
Enjoy the taste of this smell.

3070
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:23,800
WHAAAA!

3071
02:11:37,330 --> 02:11:38,090
Oh, ouch.

3072
02:11:39,190 --> 02:11:39,950
Oh, no, not again.

3073
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:56,310
I've been exploring.

3074
02:11:59,830 --> 02:12:01,550
Oh, no, not again.

3075
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:10,520
Oh...

3076
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:12,400
And...

3077
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:12,900
More guy!

3078
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:14,620
Slice him.

3079
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,300
And I see you!

3080
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:18,940
Oh, no, no, no, please.

3081
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:19,980
Please!

3082
02:12:20,580 --> 02:12:20,720
Woo!

3083
02:12:22,900 --> 02:12:24,060
I'm trying to get this guy!

3084
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:24,880
No!

3085
02:12:25,020 --> 02:12:25,980
I lost my combo!

3086
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:27,380
That sucks.

3087
02:12:40,110 --> 02:12:41,050
I tried.

3088
02:12:51,850 --> 02:12:52,970
Oh, hello.

3089
02:12:54,070 --> 02:12:54,810
Anything else here?

3090
02:12:57,350 --> 02:12:58,130
Maybe no.

3091
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:03,260
So I am supposed to be going this way.

3092
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:04,800
Like, if I...

3093
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:07,200
Is it right click?

3094
02:13:08,100 --> 02:13:08,900
Oh, maybe...

3095
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:10,400
Right click or left click?

3096
02:13:13,220 --> 02:13:14,180
I am progressing.

3097
02:13:14,400 --> 02:13:15,340
It feels like I am.

3098
02:13:16,380 --> 02:13:18,500
Wait, so then I should go back the other way.

3099
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:20,880
Oh, nope.

3100
02:13:26,980 --> 02:13:28,560
Is left... I missed the blurb?

3101
02:13:28,760 --> 02:13:29,100
Where at?

3102
02:13:29,860 --> 02:13:30,960
Is it on the other side?

3103
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:32,060
Okay, let's go back.

3104
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,400
Okay, this is the progressing way.

3105
02:13:35,560 --> 02:13:38,580
And then the other way was not the progressing way.

3106
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:41,500
Okay.

3107
02:13:41,640 --> 02:13:41,780
Okay.

3108
02:13:42,280 --> 02:13:44,200
I wish I could make...

3109
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:46,660
Um...

3110
02:13:46,660 --> 02:13:47,780
Be a little faster.

3111
02:13:49,580 --> 02:13:50,500
Okay, here we go.

3112
02:13:50,600 --> 02:13:50,840
Here we go.

3113
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:51,240
Here we go.

3114
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:52,760
Nasty.

3115
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:54,840
Easy.

3116
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,360
You will soon?

3117
02:14:00,620 --> 02:14:02,680
Yeah, I figured that I will.

3118
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:04,880
Wow, this is very suggestive.

3119
02:14:11,650 --> 02:14:13,170
There's a blurb fragment!

3120
02:14:14,750 --> 02:14:15,230
Nice.

3121
02:14:20,890 --> 02:14:21,970
What else here?

3122
02:14:24,530 --> 02:14:25,290
Thank you.

3123
02:14:25,290 --> 02:14:26,930
What are you?

3124
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:27,190
What are you?

3125
02:14:27,190 --> 02:14:27,210
Oh.

3126
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:29,350
Oh, I have...

3127
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:30,070
What's this?

3128
02:14:35,600 --> 02:14:36,860
Oh gosh.

3129
02:14:37,160 --> 02:14:38,200
It's so nasty.

3130
02:14:46,520 --> 02:14:47,320
Whoa.

3131
02:14:50,420 --> 02:14:53,100
Oh, what?

3132
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:53,180
What?

3133
02:14:53,740 --> 02:14:54,860
I'm getting paid!

3134
02:14:55,080 --> 02:14:55,600
Make money!

3135
02:14:57,220 --> 02:14:58,120
Chop, chop!

3136
02:15:02,070 --> 02:15:03,230
Can I go up here?

3137
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:05,870
Uh...

3138
02:15:08,570 --> 02:15:09,650
Wait, oh...

3139
02:15:09,650 --> 02:15:11,750
Oh, there we go.

3140
02:15:13,750 --> 02:15:14,470
Thank you.

3141
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:15,470
Wait, what is this?

3142
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:17,430
Oh!

3143
02:15:17,430 --> 02:15:17,550
Oh!

3144
02:15:18,630 --> 02:15:19,790
I found it.

3145
02:15:21,050 --> 02:15:23,090
I found the secret mission!

3146
02:15:25,450 --> 02:15:26,650
I found it!

3147
02:15:27,170 --> 02:15:27,850
I found it!

3148
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:28,610
Let's see what it is.

3149
02:15:29,930 --> 02:15:34,030
I was like, I know there's like a little spot you gotta like sit on- or stand on top of.

3150
02:15:35,010 --> 02:15:35,990
Calvin, welcome to membership!

3151
02:15:36,170 --> 02:15:36,730
Thank you!

3152
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:38,890
Collect all of the warbs!

3153
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:42,950
You think I could do it?

3154
02:15:49,610 --> 02:15:50,950
Do I get to keep them?

3155
02:15:54,150 --> 02:15:55,050
Oh my god!

3156
02:15:58,030 --> 02:15:58,990
Oh, oh, oh.

3157
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:01,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

3158
02:16:01,650 --> 02:16:01,730
Oh.

3159
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:05,030
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3160
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:08,110
Do I only get to keep...

3161
02:16:08,110 --> 02:16:09,610
them if I...

3162
02:16:09,610 --> 02:16:10,750
if I win?

3163
02:16:11,990 --> 02:16:13,110
Oh my gosh, there's so many.

3164
02:16:23,540 --> 02:16:24,800
Oh wait, I'm too slow.

3165
02:16:24,800 --> 02:16:30,900
Oh gosh... How am I supposed to get the rest of these?

3166
02:16:31,120 --> 02:16:35,420
Oh my gosh... Holy

3167
02:16:39,470 --> 02:16:40,030
cow!

3168
02:16:41,630 --> 02:16:43,170
You'll need speed upgrade for this.

3169
02:16:43,250 --> 02:16:43,810
I think so too.

3170
02:16:46,130 --> 02:16:46,550
Wow.

3171
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:53,020
Well that was an attempt.

3172
02:16:55,980 --> 02:16:57,240
Did I get to keep them though?

3173
02:16:58,620 --> 02:16:59,340
I wish.

3174
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:04,380
Alrighty.

3175
02:17:04,380 --> 02:17:05,960
I keep seeing this van.

3176
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:09,140
Wait, let me make sure I got all the... rulers up top.

3177
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:11,740
I keep seeing this van and I think it's Niko!

3178
02:17:12,360 --> 02:17:13,080
Open up!

3179
02:17:22,890 --> 02:17:24,390
Doesn't look like anything's in there.

3180
02:17:27,590 --> 02:17:28,070
Alrighty.

3181
02:17:28,070 --> 02:17:28,250
I can't see the name.

3182
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:37,650
Destroy the people...

3183
02:17:37,650 --> 02:17:39,150
A phone.

3184
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:41,510
I wonder if I can reach that woman.

3185
02:17:42,010 --> 02:17:43,590
Yeah, there we go!

3186
02:17:44,410 --> 02:17:45,610
The phone booth.

3187
02:17:46,910 --> 02:17:48,210
One moment please.

3188
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:50,170
One moment please.

3189
02:17:51,270 --> 02:17:54,490
We're collecting all the money that we can get before we call her?

3190
02:17:55,010 --> 02:17:56,310
Destroy the people.

3191
02:17:56,310 --> 02:17:58,730
It's nice to get them in stream on the weekend.

3192
02:17:59,030 --> 02:17:59,670
Thank you!

3193
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:00,710
Detect- oh.

3194
02:18:01,470 --> 02:18:01,790
Dev.

3195
02:18:04,190 --> 02:18:05,610
Don't go too close!

3196
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:07,350
Oopsy.

3197
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:09,630
Can you touch me?

3198
02:18:10,130 --> 02:18:12,410
Can you touch me?

3199
02:18:13,190 --> 02:18:14,870
Neathog, I never liked this guy.

3200
02:18:15,350 --> 02:18:15,790
You.

3201
02:18:16,170 --> 02:18:16,530
Test.

3202
02:18:17,230 --> 02:18:18,870
I know you.

3203
02:18:19,150 --> 02:18:20,770
A box of rocks.

3204
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:22,650
Let's not even mess with this guy V.

3205
02:18:22,850 --> 02:18:24,430
He can't even leave the Clyde bot anyway.

3206
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:25,870
He's the Clyde bot parasite.

3207
02:18:26,030 --> 02:18:26,830
Yeah, he's a parasite.

3208
02:18:28,950 --> 02:18:29,730
Uh oh.

3209
02:18:30,290 --> 02:18:32,590
I think he heard me.

3210
02:18:32,770 --> 02:18:33,370
Uh oh.

3211
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:34,430
Whoop!

3212
02:18:35,610 --> 02:18:38,230
Maybe I should've um... called the...

3213
02:18:38,230 --> 02:18:38,690
Mox.

3214
02:18:39,110 --> 02:18:40,630
I didn't think... I didn't realize...

3215
02:18:40,630 --> 02:18:41,090
Oops.

3216
02:18:42,010 --> 02:18:42,610
It's fine.

3217
02:18:42,610 --> 02:18:44,430
As the air to a bird.

3218
02:18:44,790 --> 02:18:46,550
Or the sea to a fish.

3219
02:18:47,510 --> 02:18:48,370
So is contempt.

3220
02:18:49,250 --> 02:18:50,570
To the contemptible.

3221
02:18:54,550 --> 02:18:55,910
Damn, bam, bam.

3222
02:18:56,650 --> 02:18:57,130
Alright!

3223
02:18:57,790 --> 02:18:58,490
Good luck everybody!

3224
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:05,760
Good luck guys!

3225
02:19:07,680 --> 02:19:08,560
Oh my goodness.

3226
02:19:08,860 --> 02:19:09,860
It does a big damage though.

3227
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:12,160
Oh.

3228
02:19:12,540 --> 02:19:12,990
Oh.

3229
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:14,740
Nice.

3230
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:19,500
Oh,

3231
02:19:22,920 --> 02:19:23,140
oh.

3232
02:19:31,050 --> 02:19:31,950
Wow.

3233
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:33,230
He takes big damage.

3234
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:34,170
Er...

3235
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:36,050
Nice.

3236
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:36,590
Wait.

3237
02:19:42,050 --> 02:19:44,670
Please, I'm trying to tie it.

3238
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:48,340
Oh, he's doing it!

3239
02:20:03,230 --> 02:20:04,190
Come back.

3240
02:20:06,350 --> 02:20:07,950
Oh, we're back to these guys, okay.

3241
02:20:08,470 --> 02:20:09,150
It's fine.

3242
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:11,330
Bird and cat!

3243
02:20:12,290 --> 02:20:15,290
Oh, shoot!

3244
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:16,270
Ouch, ouch.

3245
02:20:23,290 --> 02:20:24,410
Nice.

3246
02:20:46,060 --> 02:20:47,180
Okay.

3247
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,120
Nice.

3248
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:55,300
Nice.

3249
02:20:57,840 --> 02:20:59,080
Send him to the wall.

3250
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:04,970
Damn.

3251
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:12,630
Oh my gosh!

3252
02:21:12,790 --> 02:21:14,130
I need to not get hit!

3253
02:21:28,450 --> 02:21:29,150
Come on!

3254
02:21:29,510 --> 02:21:30,970
Oh my gosh, I'm not doing any damage.

3255
02:21:31,370 --> 02:21:31,810
Cause...

3256
02:21:31,810 --> 02:21:33,110
This stinking guy...

3257
02:21:33,110 --> 02:21:33,790
Where are you?

3258
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:34,670
Oh, there we go.

3259
02:21:35,010 --> 02:21:38,430
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3260
02:21:44,030 --> 02:21:44,390
Okay.

3261
02:21:45,290 --> 02:21:46,310
And bring him in!

3262
02:21:49,430 --> 02:21:50,890
Book if you need to DT drill.

3263
02:21:53,330 --> 02:21:54,310
Wait, go to the other one.

3264
02:21:54,770 --> 02:21:55,590
Go to the other one.

3265
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:56,490
Go to the other one.

3266
02:21:57,510 --> 02:21:58,090
There we go.

3267
02:21:59,250 --> 02:21:59,970
I'm here!

3268
02:22:00,070 --> 02:22:00,490
He's back!

3269
02:22:00,490 --> 02:22:02,890
Go to the other one.

3270
02:22:02,890 --> 02:22:03,290
Oh my gosh!

3271
02:22:03,990 --> 02:22:04,950
Back to doing damage!

3272
02:22:05,770 --> 02:22:06,530
Back to doing damage!

3273
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:07,510
Back to doing damage!

3274
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:08,210
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

3275
02:22:08,210 --> 02:22:08,490
Woo-woo-woo!

3276
02:22:08,970 --> 02:22:10,510
Bam, bow!

3277
02:22:18,610 --> 02:22:19,970
Come on!

3278
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:20,810
Come on!

3279
02:22:22,590 --> 02:22:24,390
My guys are doing so much damage!

3280
02:22:25,550 --> 02:22:30,310
I love how my little Gollum guy is just... just... just chillin'.

3281
02:22:32,530 --> 02:22:33,530
Oh, I'll chill.

3282
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:42,500
How can I... so... my... oh my gosh... no, no!

3283
02:22:43,320 --> 02:22:49,180
I'm worried that I'm not gonna... or rather... hold on, I'll explain after.

3284
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:51,880
Because I think I'm confused about a mechanic!

3285
02:22:52,740 --> 02:22:57,180
Of the... of the... of the... everything.

3286
02:23:05,730 --> 02:23:06,490
Noooo!

3287
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:08,150
I'm so close!

3288
02:23:09,250 --> 02:23:17,430
Okay, okay, what I'm confused about is... I can't... read and fight at the same time, can I?

3289
02:23:17,610 --> 02:23:21,190
Because... I was trying to before, but it wasn't working.

3290
02:23:23,210 --> 02:23:23,870
You can?

3291
02:23:25,910 --> 02:23:29,090
Ah... that's why I wasn't reading, because I was like, how am I supposed to fight if I read?

3292
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:31,630
You just can't jump.

3293
02:23:32,470 --> 02:23:33,530
Oh... okay, okay, okay.

3294
02:23:33,930 --> 02:23:35,490
You can, but it's just difficult.

3295
02:23:36,270 --> 02:23:37,510
Okay, okay, no jumping.

3296
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:40,770
Ah... okay, let's give up.

3297
02:23:41,270 --> 02:23:42,350
I'm not gonna waste my rewards.

3298
02:23:42,350 --> 02:23:43,810
I was too late.

3299
02:23:43,930 --> 02:23:45,230
Dang, I was so close!

3300
02:23:53,350 --> 02:23:53,790
Okay.

3301
02:23:56,250 --> 02:23:57,910
Yeah, now I can use the phone, though.

3302
02:23:59,750 --> 02:24:00,630
The phone?

3303
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:02,950
I wonder if I can reach that woman.

3304
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:05,190
Well, let's not get too close, though.

3305
02:24:06,170 --> 02:24:07,330
Don't get too close.

3306
02:24:08,250 --> 02:24:08,750
Where is it?

3307
02:24:08,830 --> 02:24:09,170
Here it is.

3308
02:24:09,770 --> 02:24:10,790
Don't get too close.

3309
02:24:12,230 --> 02:24:12,670
Nice.

3310
02:24:13,870 --> 02:24:14,310
Alright.

3311
02:24:15,550 --> 02:24:15,930
Alright.

3312
02:24:16,670 --> 02:24:17,250
Give me the phone.

3313
02:24:17,450 --> 02:24:17,590
Oh!

3314
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:20,830
I'll take that, too.

3315
02:24:21,430 --> 02:24:22,670
All according to plan.

3316
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:25,290
Yeah, we got a little taste of how that guy was.

3317
02:24:25,810 --> 02:24:27,670
Dang, I really almost one-shot him, though.

3318
02:24:28,190 --> 02:24:29,270
And without any skills.

3319
02:24:41,250 --> 02:24:43,230
What if I want my panties off?

3320
02:24:43,770 --> 02:24:45,450
Is she gonna bust through the wall?

3321
02:24:59,270 --> 02:25:00,330
My god!

3322
02:25:02,530 --> 02:25:03,650
Ma'am!

3323
02:25:08,970 --> 02:25:10,190
That was close.

3324
02:25:11,050 --> 02:25:12,130
Good job, team.

3325
02:25:12,130 --> 02:25:13,370
Team Malfour.

3326
02:25:13,590 --> 02:25:14,610
Good job to you, too.

3327
02:25:16,310 --> 02:25:17,270
Good job to you.

3328
02:25:21,720 --> 02:25:22,000
Customize?

3329
02:25:22,580 --> 02:25:23,020
Customize.

3330
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:24,900
Okay.

3331
02:25:26,260 --> 02:25:27,560
This is the most sturdy...

3332
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:28,540
What kind of car is this?

3333
02:25:28,600 --> 02:25:30,480
Because it's the most sturdy car ever.

3334
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:34,560
I think there's multiple enemies ready to kill.

3335
02:25:35,340 --> 02:25:35,700
Wait.

3336
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:36,180
Oh.

3337
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:37,260
You got to hold...

3338
02:25:38,660 --> 02:25:41,740
Circle B to kill them, or else you have to touch the ground again.

3339
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:43,160
Yeah.

3340
02:25:45,220 --> 02:25:45,700
Um...

3341
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:48,040
Yes.

3342
02:25:48,440 --> 02:25:49,260
You have to...

3343
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:50,700
Kill them.

3344
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:52,660
Wait, hold on.

3345
02:25:52,760 --> 02:25:53,600
Did I read your thing right?

3346
02:25:55,320 --> 02:25:58,760
If there's multiple enemies to kill, I think you've got to hold the...

3347
02:25:58,760 --> 02:25:59,360
Oh!

3348
02:26:00,180 --> 02:26:00,460
Oh!

3349
02:26:00,680 --> 02:26:01,320
You have to... Okay.

3350
02:26:01,320 --> 02:26:02,480
You hold it.

3351
02:26:02,580 --> 02:26:03,280
If there's multiple.

3352
02:26:03,480 --> 02:26:03,800
Because, yeah.

3353
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:05,060
I didn't notice that I would like...

3354
02:26:05,060 --> 02:26:07,180
Be pressing B after I killed one.

3355
02:26:09,180 --> 02:26:09,880
Okay, okay.

3356
02:26:10,400 --> 02:26:11,340
Let's see what we got.

3357
02:26:16,020 --> 02:26:16,460
Ooh...

3358
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,360
Is this just making him go fast?

3359
02:26:19,740 --> 02:26:20,620
That's so nice.

3360
02:26:22,980 --> 02:26:24,480
Oh, it's an unlockable.

3361
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:24,900
Okay.

3362
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,200
How can we unlock it though?

3363
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:28,120
Oh!

3364
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:30,800
Trigger heart is important.

3365
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:38,210
Warbs!

3366
02:26:38,570 --> 02:26:39,370
That's nice.

3367
02:26:42,950 --> 02:26:43,570
Yeah.

3368
02:26:43,730 --> 02:26:44,250
Trigger heart.

3369
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:46,730
But I want to see how much the one is for...

3370
02:26:47,090 --> 02:26:48,050
Well, Nightmare is active.

3371
02:26:48,330 --> 02:26:48,850
Press...

3372
02:26:48,850 --> 02:26:49,190
It'll bleed.

3373
02:26:49,850 --> 02:26:51,270
B or A.

3374
02:26:51,570 --> 02:26:52,950
Near Nightmare to mount him!

3375
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:53,650
Whoa!

3376
02:26:54,490 --> 02:26:56,550
Right atop the demonic beast.

3377
02:26:56,830 --> 02:26:57,590
That's fun.

3378
02:26:58,570 --> 02:26:59,570
Royal fork!

3379
02:27:00,950 --> 02:27:02,070
Get forked.

3380
02:27:03,910 --> 02:27:06,310
Rain down demonic canes from on high.

3381
02:27:06,750 --> 02:27:06,950
Okay.

3382
02:27:07,070 --> 02:27:08,190
Well, I can't even afford that.

3383
02:27:08,970 --> 02:27:09,610
But...

3384
02:27:10,050 --> 02:27:10,370
Oh!

3385
02:27:11,530 --> 02:27:13,490
Hold X longer than release.

3386
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:23,440
Can't afford it.

3387
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:29,800
Oh, gosh.

3388
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:30,760
There's so many things.

3389
02:27:35,560 --> 02:27:36,800
So let's...

3390
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:37,780
First of all...

3391
02:27:38,140 --> 02:27:39,960
I don't know why you would try trigger her.

3392
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,180
I guess to see how much longer...

3393
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:41,900
Okay.

3394
02:27:41,980 --> 02:27:42,700
Let's learn that.

3395
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:43,980
Because that's like...

3396
02:27:43,980 --> 02:27:45,160
Pretty standard.

3397
02:27:47,700 --> 02:27:48,260
Um...

3398
02:27:48,260 --> 02:27:49,980
That's like important, I'd say.

3399
02:27:52,780 --> 02:27:54,140
Quick play is sprint.

3400
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:56,360
Yeah, but...

3401
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:58,520
It can't be activated in battle.

3402
02:27:58,920 --> 02:28:00,720
So should I just hold off?

3403
02:28:01,980 --> 02:28:03,000
And get something...

3404
02:28:03,540 --> 02:28:05,680
That would be for Griffin and Shadow?

3405
02:28:10,350 --> 02:28:10,790
Shadow?

3406
02:28:10,790 --> 02:28:12,310
Yeah, I think like after this...

3407
02:28:12,770 --> 02:28:14,810
I think after this mission I can get it.

3408
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:17,590
But...

3409
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:26,270
Pick it up with the mission clear orbs.

3410
02:28:26,350 --> 02:28:27,310
Yeah, I think that's what I'll do.

3411
02:28:29,130 --> 02:28:31,850
Cause I think it would be better to get stuff for...

3412
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:33,890
For Shadow and...

3413
02:28:33,890 --> 02:28:35,290
For Griffin...

3414
02:28:35,290 --> 02:28:36,510
Or Nightmare...

3415
02:28:38,190 --> 02:28:38,890
Then...

3416
02:28:38,890 --> 02:28:39,510
Um...

3417
02:28:40,210 --> 02:28:40,650
Whoa!

3418
02:28:41,050 --> 02:28:41,890
Someone said...

3419
02:28:41,890 --> 02:28:42,910
To get the hedgehog.

3420
02:28:43,430 --> 02:28:43,910
Uh...

3421
02:28:43,910 --> 02:28:45,650
Because we're going into battle...

3422
02:28:45,650 --> 02:28:46,630
I won't need it.

3423
02:28:47,250 --> 02:28:48,330
Until after.

3424
02:28:48,670 --> 02:28:49,310
So...

3425
02:28:49,310 --> 02:28:50,030
Plus it's cheap.

3426
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:52,910
Oh my god!

3427
02:28:53,310 --> 02:28:54,330
It's just...

3428
02:28:56,550 --> 02:28:57,950
It's just...

3429
02:28:57,950 --> 02:28:58,810
Oh...

3430
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:02,330
Hedgehog is pretty easy.

3431
02:29:02,770 --> 02:29:04,310
What if we learn these two?

3432
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:06,150
Yeah, Stinger!

3433
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,850
What if I learn those two...

3434
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:11,670
And then we learn something for Griffin as well?

3435
02:29:16,010 --> 02:29:16,490
Yoni!

3436
02:29:16,710 --> 02:29:18,070
Thank you so much for the 5-grip detector!

3437
02:29:19,650 --> 02:29:20,130
Learn...

3438
02:29:22,270 --> 02:29:22,750
Alright...

3439
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:24,330
Griffin...

3440
02:29:24,330 --> 02:29:25,110
What do you know?

3441
02:29:25,630 --> 02:29:27,410
Oh, this is X longer...

3442
02:29:29,070 --> 02:29:30,350
Double check...

3443
02:29:35,910 --> 02:29:36,230
Whoa...

3444
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:38,950
Fire an electric shock that slams the enemies...

3445
02:29:43,210 --> 02:29:43,850
Okay...

3446
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:47,050
Yeah, it's a big V...

3447
02:29:47,470 --> 02:29:48,650
It's a big V!

3448
02:29:53,090 --> 02:29:55,370
Not enough for flank attack...

3449
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:56,270
Yeah...

3450
02:29:58,670 --> 02:29:59,470
That's just...

3451
02:29:59,470 --> 02:30:00,010
That's just...

3452
02:30:00,010 --> 02:30:00,170
That's just...

3453
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:01,130
His Stinger...

3454
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:13,100
I think I can only get one thing...

3455
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:16,080
Bird Stinger...

3456
02:30:16,080 --> 02:30:17,060
The hold one is good...

3457
02:30:17,060 --> 02:30:17,920
Round Robin too...

3458
02:30:28,360 --> 02:30:29,320
Go up...

3459
02:30:29,320 --> 02:30:29,560
Oh!

3460
02:30:29,740 --> 02:30:30,000
Oh!

3461
02:30:30,280 --> 02:30:31,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

3462
02:30:32,280 --> 02:30:33,040
I was like...

3463
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:33,660
Wait a second...

3464
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:35,080
I thought there was more...

3465
02:30:35,080 --> 02:30:35,540
Okay...

3466
02:30:35,540 --> 02:30:36,600
So this is...

3467
02:30:36,600 --> 02:30:36,920
Hold...

3468
02:30:36,920 --> 02:30:38,460
For longer than release...

3469
02:30:38,460 --> 02:30:38,760
Okay...

3470
02:30:38,760 --> 02:30:40,060
Block into...

3471
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:43,200
Okay...

3472
02:30:43,200 --> 02:30:45,320
Round Robin can shred this boss...

3473
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:57,180
I'm gonna have to now focus on two different sets of combos...

3474
02:31:01,320 --> 02:31:02,500
Wait, can I get both?

3475
02:31:02,660 --> 02:31:03,240
I can get...

3476
02:31:04,540 --> 02:31:06,440
I can get both...

3477
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:15,620
There we go...

3478
02:31:17,660 --> 02:31:19,620
V is a nightmare for non-multitaskers...

3479
02:31:20,580 --> 02:31:23,260
It will take me some time to understand him...

3480
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:23,580
But...

3481
02:31:23,580 --> 02:31:25,260
I think we'll get it eventually...

3482
02:31:29,060 --> 02:31:30,080
Alright...

3483
02:31:32,010 --> 02:31:34,240
For my double checker...

3484
02:31:35,960 --> 02:31:37,490
Okie dokie...

3485
02:31:37,960 --> 02:31:38,880
Cool...

3486
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:39,520
Um...

3487
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:40,660
I think that...

3488
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:44,520
Alright, let's go try again...

3489
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,020
If you're done...

3490
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:47,860
Get moving...

3491
02:31:47,860 --> 02:31:49,000
I'm gonna have a smoke...

3492
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:49,820
And then head out...

3493
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:50,920
Okie...

3494
02:31:53,500 --> 02:31:54,480
What does that say?

3495
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:56,860
Bails the butcher?

3496
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,000
Hakos?

3497
02:32:02,460 --> 02:32:03,420
Hakos tacos...

3498
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:04,660
Toot toot fruits...

3499
02:32:05,840 --> 02:32:06,300
Switch...

3500
02:32:06,300 --> 02:32:08,700
I don't want my fruits to have me do...

3501
02:32:08,700 --> 02:32:09,560
100%...

3502
02:32:09,560 --> 02:32:11,090
Always 100% organic...

3503
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:15,060
Glorious greens...

3504
02:32:17,870 --> 02:32:18,390
Glorious greens...

3505
02:32:18,390 --> 02:32:19,850
Fishy delights...

3506
02:32:19,850 --> 02:32:21,630
Locally caught fish...

3507
02:32:21,630 --> 02:32:24,330
Fresh seafood is good for you...

3508
02:32:24,330 --> 02:32:24,860
Oh...

3509
02:32:42,110 --> 02:32:42,890
Oh...

3510
02:32:42,890 --> 02:32:43,610
Oh...

3511
02:32:44,930 --> 02:32:49,340
Slice him...

3512
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:54,200
Okie...

3513
02:32:55,140 --> 02:32:55,720
Oh...

3514
02:32:55,720 --> 02:32:57,060
Ok...

3515
02:32:57,060 --> 02:32:57,660
What did I...

3516
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:00,900
Wait...

3517
02:33:01,140 --> 02:33:01,480
Go...

3518
02:33:01,480 --> 02:33:01,880
Go...

3519
02:33:02,800 --> 02:33:03,400
Wait...

3520
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:03,780
No...

3521
02:33:10,230 --> 02:33:11,430
I don't understand...

3522
02:33:11,430 --> 02:33:11,810
Why...

3523
02:33:11,810 --> 02:33:12,430
Why...

3524
02:33:12,430 --> 02:33:12,970
Game...

3525
02:33:12,970 --> 02:33:13,790
What the...

3526
02:33:13,790 --> 02:33:14,110
What...

3527
02:33:14,110 --> 02:33:14,710
What is happening?

3528
02:33:16,530 --> 02:33:19,810
The chair was blocking him...

3529
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:26,940
Not doing as good this time...

3530
02:33:30,140 --> 02:33:33,900
Let's get our guy in there...

3531
02:33:46,520 --> 02:33:46,880
Whoop...

3532
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:47,860
Whoop...

3533
02:33:47,860 --> 02:33:47,880
Whoop...

3534
02:33:48,820 --> 02:33:49,180
Whoop...

3535
02:33:53,060 --> 02:33:53,420
Whoop...

3536
02:33:53,420 --> 02:33:54,280
Yeah, just get...

3537
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:54,820
Oh yeah...

3538
02:33:54,820 --> 02:33:55,460
Get him down...

3539
02:33:55,460 --> 02:33:56,920
Get him...

3540
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:57,060
He's...

3541
02:33:57,060 --> 02:33:58,400
We'll get him while he's down...

3542
02:34:08,720 --> 02:34:09,080
Oh...

3543
02:34:09,080 --> 02:34:10,100
That kinda sucked...

3544
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:10,760
He's gonna go...

3545
02:34:10,760 --> 02:34:12,420
I don't even think I got him...

3546
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:12,840
Huuu...

3547
02:34:22,530 --> 02:34:23,090
Why...

3548
02:34:23,850 --> 02:34:24,410
Please...

3549
02:34:24,410 --> 02:34:24,470
Please!

3550
02:34:24,670 --> 02:34:25,230
Please...

3551
02:34:26,430 --> 02:34:27,550
Please read!

3552
02:34:28,790 --> 02:34:29,910
Please read...

3553
02:34:29,910 --> 02:34:30,950
Please read...

3554
02:34:30,950 --> 02:34:32,330
Why aren't you bullying out your book?

3555
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:34,030
Why aren't you bullying out your book?

3556
02:34:38,710 --> 02:34:40,510
I'm pressing RT I promise!

3557
02:34:40,510 --> 02:34:40,890
What is this?

3558
02:34:43,290 --> 02:34:44,330
I'm pressing RT.

3559
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:46,530
I've been pressing... There we go, finally.

3560
02:34:48,270 --> 02:34:49,570
This is ass.

3561
02:35:05,410 --> 02:35:06,490
What do you mean, sure?

3562
02:35:06,610 --> 02:35:07,710
You don't know what I'm fucking doing.

3563
02:35:08,430 --> 02:35:09,390
I really have.

3564
02:35:09,910 --> 02:35:10,190
Read.

3565
02:35:10,430 --> 02:35:10,810
There we go.

3566
02:35:11,030 --> 02:35:11,190
Okay.

3567
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:13,590
I think you have to hold it down, maybe.

3568
02:35:13,950 --> 02:35:14,570
Oh my god.

3569
02:35:20,660 --> 02:35:21,520
I'm gonna get hit.

3570
02:35:21,620 --> 02:35:22,220
I'm gonna get hit.

3571
02:35:22,300 --> 02:35:22,940
I'm gonna get hit.

3572
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:23,720
I'm gonna get hit.

3573
02:35:23,780 --> 02:35:24,720
I'm gonna get hit, baby.

3574
02:35:28,800 --> 02:35:29,160
Nice.

3575
02:35:29,440 --> 02:35:29,440
Okay.

3576
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:35,480
Nice.

3577
02:35:41,460 --> 02:35:41,820
Slice.

3578
02:35:42,620 --> 02:35:43,100
Woo!

3579
02:35:54,610 --> 02:35:55,390
So fast.

3580
02:35:56,030 --> 02:35:57,470
I don't know if I'll get it again though.

3581
02:36:00,810 --> 02:36:01,290
Ugh.

3582
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:02,050
Oh my goodness.

3583
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:50,820
Yeah.

3584
02:36:51,240 --> 02:36:53,240
Oh there he is.

3585
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:54,340
Yeah!

3586
02:36:56,740 --> 02:36:59,540
The cutworm keeps the brow.

3587
02:36:59,940 --> 02:37:01,040
What do you say?

3588
02:37:05,910 --> 02:37:06,890
Can I get him?

3589
02:37:08,890 --> 02:37:10,050
Get him up there.

3590
02:37:10,350 --> 02:37:11,030
Get him down here.

3591
02:37:11,290 --> 02:37:11,750
Get him wherever.

3592
02:37:12,310 --> 02:37:12,430
Woo!

3593
02:37:14,990 --> 02:37:15,890
Skewered baby.

3594
02:37:19,470 --> 02:37:20,090
Yakitori.

3595
02:37:22,530 --> 02:37:23,790
Oh, seven needs...

3596
02:37:28,190 --> 02:37:28,670
Okay.

3597
02:37:29,430 --> 02:37:30,270
Um, alright.

3598
02:37:30,450 --> 02:37:31,970
That's not good at all.

3599
02:37:32,190 --> 02:37:32,830
That's not good.

3600
02:37:34,170 --> 02:37:34,650
Wait.

3601
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:35,290
Where?

3602
02:37:35,410 --> 02:37:36,190
Where are you going?

3603
02:37:36,390 --> 02:37:37,090
Are you running away?

3604
02:37:37,770 --> 02:37:38,850
That's not a good sign.

3605
02:37:40,230 --> 02:37:41,210
I'm afraid then.

3606
02:37:41,750 --> 02:37:44,270
That's a little bit more than I can take on right now.

3607
02:37:46,390 --> 02:37:46,870
Um...

3608
02:37:47,390 --> 02:37:47,870
Oh!

3609
02:37:48,130 --> 02:37:48,330
Oh!

3610
02:37:48,530 --> 02:37:51,230
Yeah, I think the time to run is...

3611
02:37:51,230 --> 02:37:58,880
Oh my god!

3612
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:00,480
He was crazy.

3613
02:38:01,480 --> 02:38:03,160
He was so cool looking.

3614
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:05,360
Yay!

3615
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:06,640
More roll arms!

3616
02:38:07,420 --> 02:38:07,740
Nice.

3617
02:38:08,580 --> 02:38:09,220
Bro said nope.

3618
02:38:09,620 --> 02:38:10,100
I know!

3619
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:10,180
Whoa!

3620
02:38:12,040 --> 02:38:13,900
V has some common sense.

3621
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:16,580
And sandals.

3622
02:38:16,840 --> 02:38:16,960
Wow.

3623
02:38:18,540 --> 02:38:19,900
June 15th.

3624
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:21,340
7.30 AM!

3625
02:38:21,820 --> 02:38:23,600
Gosh, it's way too early for this.

3626
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,020
V has come and V has left.

3627
02:38:30,020 --> 02:38:31,000
Let's go find a game of cards.

3628
02:38:31,240 --> 02:38:32,780
These Glyphod roots.

3629
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:34,820
They're everywhere.

3630
02:38:35,560 --> 02:38:38,240
Well, we are underground.

3631
02:38:41,200 --> 02:38:43,720
Then I guess we have some clearing up to do.

3632
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,000
And me without my gardening shears.

3633
02:38:46,320 --> 02:38:46,400
Huh.

3634
02:38:54,100 --> 02:38:54,580
Nice.

3635
02:38:54,820 --> 02:38:55,440
Oh, lady!

3636
02:38:57,440 --> 02:38:58,400
Lady, lady.

3637
02:39:03,090 --> 02:39:03,450
Okay.

3638
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,710
Munch, munch.

3639
02:39:07,030 --> 02:39:08,430
I'm eating some snack.

3640
02:39:09,050 --> 02:39:09,830
Starting to get hungry.

3641
02:39:11,590 --> 02:39:12,490
Oh, but what's new?

3642
02:39:12,610 --> 02:39:12,770
Okay.

3643
02:39:15,790 --> 02:39:16,490
What was...

3644
02:39:16,490 --> 02:39:18,530
Oh, hedgehog was the other thing that I got.

3645
02:39:19,490 --> 02:39:20,510
I was like, wait a second.

3646
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:22,330
I got something else and I don't remember.

3647
02:39:23,270 --> 02:39:26,610
But it's literally the same thing as a...

3648
02:39:27,510 --> 02:39:29,230
As a blockade.

3649
02:39:29,450 --> 02:39:30,630
But for the cat.

3650
02:39:32,610 --> 02:39:33,250
Okay.

3651
02:39:34,350 --> 02:39:34,990
Um...

3652
02:39:34,990 --> 02:39:36,330
And then I was...

3653
02:39:36,330 --> 02:39:37,450
I was doing the breakthrough.

3654
02:39:37,650 --> 02:39:38,330
I was doing that.

3655
02:39:38,470 --> 02:39:38,630
Okay.

3656
02:39:38,950 --> 02:39:40,010
So let's...

3657
02:39:40,010 --> 02:39:40,950
Let's get this.

3658
02:39:42,330 --> 02:39:42,970
Nice.

3659
02:39:45,990 --> 02:39:46,630
Um...

3660
02:39:49,650 --> 02:39:52,230
I guess we could save for something else.

3661
02:39:52,450 --> 02:39:53,590
Time to surf, baby.

3662
02:39:55,270 --> 02:39:56,150
What was it?

3663
02:39:56,470 --> 02:39:57,050
Oh, wait.

3664
02:39:59,030 --> 02:39:59,550
Uh...

3665
02:39:59,550 --> 02:40:00,290
Flank attack.

3666
02:40:00,630 --> 02:40:01,330
Let's learn that.

3667
02:40:03,590 --> 02:40:09,110
Imagine having to work next day and waking up at 7am by a big ad demon crab destroying the city.

3668
02:40:10,130 --> 02:40:11,630
Should he be mad or glad?

3669
02:40:12,030 --> 02:40:14,930
I mean, you should interview the people of Townsville.

3670
02:40:14,930 --> 02:40:17,390
It's literally what they deal with, like, daily basis.

3671
02:40:19,430 --> 02:40:21,070
And you know what's even more messed up?

3672
02:40:21,150 --> 02:40:24,290
Is the Powerpuff Girls live in the suburbs of Townsville.

3673
02:40:24,470 --> 02:40:27,930
They don't even try to live close so they can be on the scene immediately.

3674
02:40:28,730 --> 02:40:30,690
No, they're just like, we're gonna take our...

3675
02:40:30,690 --> 02:40:32,830
We're gonna live on the outskirts because we're smart.

3676
02:40:33,090 --> 02:40:35,990
And we don't live in the city where all the monsters are attacking.

3677
02:40:38,570 --> 02:40:39,290
Okie dokie.

3678
02:40:40,230 --> 02:40:41,050
That should be good.

3679
02:40:44,930 --> 02:40:45,550
Mission 5.

3680
02:40:45,930 --> 02:40:47,490
The Devil Sword Sparta.

3681
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:52,630
The professor wasn't gonna sell the home.

3682
02:40:52,810 --> 02:40:54,290
He was still paying the mortgage.

3683
02:40:55,730 --> 02:40:57,150
Now to find an exit.

3684
02:40:57,490 --> 02:40:58,010
Yeah.

3685
02:40:59,010 --> 02:41:00,670
Now to find an exit.

3686
02:41:00,950 --> 02:41:01,770
Alright, nothing over here.

3687
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:05,860
Whoa.

3688
02:41:06,460 --> 02:41:06,860
Whoa.

3689
02:41:08,940 --> 02:41:09,340
Whoa.

3690
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:10,160
Whoa.

3691
02:41:25,260 --> 02:41:25,660
Whoop.

3692
02:41:26,020 --> 02:41:26,420
Whoop.

3693
02:41:27,780 --> 02:41:28,180
Whoop.

3694
02:41:28,260 --> 02:41:28,280
Whoop.

3695
02:41:28,340 --> 02:41:28,380
Whoop.

3696
02:41:28,880 --> 02:41:29,880
Yeah, get that guy.

3697
02:41:36,080 --> 02:41:36,860
Can't see anything.

3698
02:41:37,420 --> 02:41:38,260
Wait, I'm holding.

3699
02:41:38,460 --> 02:41:39,440
Oh, I'm holding the wrong thing.

3700
02:41:39,520 --> 02:41:39,840
There we go.

3701
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:41,180
This is the pleasure.

3702
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:44,120
Wait, I'm trying to hold why, but it's...

3703
02:41:44,120 --> 02:41:45,160
Why isn't he doing it?

3704
02:41:52,570 --> 02:41:53,700
He's not doing this though.

3705
02:41:56,340 --> 02:41:56,920
Whoop.

3706
02:41:58,540 --> 02:41:59,120
Twice.

3707
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:05,520
Twice.

3708
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:22,340
I was holding why to try and have him do the...

3709
02:42:22,340 --> 02:42:23,420
The...

3710
02:42:24,160 --> 02:42:25,820
But I didn't get it.

3711
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:27,280
Long charge.

3712
02:42:27,280 --> 02:42:27,720
Rise.

3713
02:42:29,200 --> 02:42:30,140
Slice him.

3714
02:42:33,140 --> 02:42:33,860
Ah.

3715
02:42:34,280 --> 02:42:34,460
Oh.

3716
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:40,500
It's a long charge time.

3717
02:42:40,880 --> 02:42:41,160
Yeah.

3718
02:42:41,780 --> 02:42:42,500
Okay.

3719
02:42:42,660 --> 02:42:42,760
Okay.

3720
02:42:42,900 --> 02:42:42,960
Okay.

3721
02:42:43,820 --> 02:42:45,520
I understand now.

3722
02:42:46,540 --> 02:42:47,540
I understand.

3723
02:42:49,560 --> 02:42:51,680
Can't move forward without breaking through these.

3724
02:42:54,620 --> 02:42:55,420
Here, you do it.

3725
02:42:55,920 --> 02:42:56,840
You guys do it.

3726
02:42:59,580 --> 02:43:02,130
There we go.

3727
02:43:02,370 --> 02:43:02,790
There we go.

3728
02:43:04,630 --> 02:43:06,190
It's ready when you hear the whoosh.

3729
02:43:06,330 --> 02:43:07,170
Yeah, he glows.

3730
02:43:08,130 --> 02:43:10,030
I thought I was holding it for long enough.

3731
02:43:13,070 --> 02:43:14,110
Can we break this?

3732
02:43:15,110 --> 02:43:15,350
No.

3733
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:22,430
One moment, please.

3734
02:43:24,690 --> 02:43:26,410
It's like popping a pimple.

3735
02:43:26,670 --> 02:43:27,110
Ew.

3736
02:43:32,710 --> 02:43:33,510
Whoa.

3737
02:43:33,890 --> 02:43:34,850
Where are we?

3738
02:43:39,630 --> 02:43:40,430
Okay.

3739
02:43:41,690 --> 02:43:43,550
Surfing on shadow actually does damage.

3740
02:43:43,730 --> 02:43:44,630
It does?

3741
02:43:47,610 --> 02:43:48,310
Who's attacking?

3742
02:43:53,460 --> 02:43:54,540
Whoa, sick.

3743
02:44:01,390 --> 02:44:02,290
Oh my god.

3744
02:44:04,890 --> 02:44:05,550
Gouge him.

3745
02:44:05,950 --> 02:44:06,550
Gouge him.

3746
02:44:08,790 --> 02:44:09,730
Get your book out.

3747
02:44:10,250 --> 02:44:10,830
Get your book out.

3748
02:44:11,010 --> 02:44:12,210
Get your book out.

3749
02:44:18,950 --> 02:44:19,570
Oh, I did it.

3750
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:21,990
Okay.

3751
02:44:22,130 --> 02:44:22,890
Put it, put it away.

3752
02:44:23,410 --> 02:44:24,770
I wanna get my roars.

3753
02:44:24,930 --> 02:44:25,490
They're gonna disappear.

3754
02:44:25,810 --> 02:44:26,250
Please.

3755
02:44:30,310 --> 02:44:31,530
Why did you do that?

3756
02:44:31,970 --> 02:44:33,510
Why did you knock me off?

3757
02:44:43,610 --> 02:44:47,550
I didn't even have my hand on the controller and he shoved me off the thing.

3758
02:44:48,910 --> 02:44:49,970
Okay.

3759
02:44:56,650 --> 02:44:58,260
I said he knocked me off.

3760
02:45:02,320 --> 02:45:03,230
What are we getting?

3761
02:45:03,530 --> 02:45:04,720
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

3762
02:45:08,960 --> 02:45:09,490
Woo!

3763
02:45:13,710 --> 02:45:14,770
Yeah.

3764
02:45:29,940 --> 02:45:30,470
Yeah.

3765
02:45:36,070 --> 02:45:37,030
Oh, not yet.

3766
02:45:37,150 --> 02:45:37,590
Not yet.

3767
02:45:41,510 --> 02:45:42,510
Not yet.

3768
02:45:42,810 --> 02:45:43,170
Nice.

3769
02:45:48,950 --> 02:45:50,190
Is that everybody?

3770
02:45:50,810 --> 02:45:51,390
Oh, nope.

3771
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:55,710
Yeah.

3772
02:45:55,790 --> 02:45:56,910
Just take care of them.

3773
02:45:57,090 --> 02:45:58,070
Just take care of them.

3774
02:46:03,730 --> 02:46:04,190
Woo!

3775
02:46:04,630 --> 02:46:05,330
Oh, oh.

3776
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:06,250
That's not, that's not.

3777
02:46:07,070 --> 02:46:07,990
You're not ready.

3778
02:46:10,030 --> 02:46:10,710
You are.

3779
02:46:10,710 --> 02:46:10,770
Okay.

3780
02:46:11,250 --> 02:46:11,950
You're ready.

3781
02:46:16,560 --> 02:46:17,520
Holy canali.

3782
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:31,120
Nothing up there, okay.

3783
02:46:32,140 --> 02:46:33,580
Make sure they're ripe.

3784
02:46:33,980 --> 02:46:35,780
Yeah, ripe for the smashing.

3785
02:46:40,890 --> 02:46:42,030
You handle this.

3786
02:46:42,450 --> 02:46:43,410
No, no, no, no.

3787
02:46:43,550 --> 02:46:44,330
Look, look at it.

3788
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:48,630
Yeah, you handle it.

3789
02:46:50,290 --> 02:46:51,890
Cause I go in and I smash.

3790
02:47:11,280 --> 02:47:12,300
I'm holding Y.

3791
02:47:13,100 --> 02:47:13,900
Oh, there it is.

3792
02:47:14,120 --> 02:47:14,360
Whoa.

3793
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:26,300
I thought he was ready.

3794
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:27,700
There he is.

3795
02:47:33,300 --> 02:47:35,700
Oh, I thought that was a secret mission for a second.

3796
02:47:37,720 --> 02:47:39,620
Um, what's over here?

3797
02:47:41,100 --> 02:47:42,060
What's over here?

3798
02:47:42,500 --> 02:47:42,980
Oh!

3799
02:47:43,860 --> 02:47:45,400
Stop, stop, stop, panther.

3800
02:47:45,540 --> 02:47:46,300
Stop, stop, stop.

3801
02:47:46,980 --> 02:47:48,440
We must get the lore.

3802
02:47:51,240 --> 02:47:53,220
Remember to, ah, nice.

3803
02:47:53,420 --> 02:47:54,400
Remember to read the book.

3804
02:47:54,740 --> 02:47:55,500
I do.

3805
02:47:55,860 --> 02:48:00,200
I just have to, you have to like hold it down for it to come out.

3806
02:48:01,560 --> 02:48:03,900
And I'm always running around too much.

3807
02:48:03,900 --> 02:48:05,320
If I run with...

3808
02:48:05,820 --> 02:48:08,320
Yeah, see, it doesn't do it if I'm running and...

3809
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:09,080
Wait, what's over there?

3810
02:48:10,300 --> 02:48:11,000
Oh, nothing?

3811
02:48:11,280 --> 02:48:11,420
Okay.

3812
02:48:11,580 --> 02:48:13,140
Oh, it looks like I can go through there, no?

3813
02:48:16,560 --> 02:48:18,500
I think it's just easier to taunt, no?

3814
02:48:21,660 --> 02:48:22,340
What's in there?

3815
02:48:22,780 --> 02:48:23,480
What's in there?

3816
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:24,760
What's in there?

3817
02:48:25,360 --> 02:48:26,160
What's in there?

3818
02:48:30,410 --> 02:48:31,110
What's in there?

3819
02:48:33,530 --> 02:48:34,370
I can break it?

3820
02:48:34,370 --> 02:48:34,910
I can't.

3821
02:48:35,010 --> 02:48:35,610
I don't...

3822
02:48:35,610 --> 02:48:36,690
I know I can break this.

3823
02:48:38,450 --> 02:48:39,130
Come here.

3824
02:48:39,290 --> 02:48:39,930
It's your turn.

3825
02:48:40,170 --> 02:48:40,910
At your pleasure.

3826
02:48:42,050 --> 02:48:43,430
Nah, I can't.

3827
02:48:45,410 --> 02:48:46,530
Maybe I go around.

3828
02:48:48,470 --> 02:48:49,290
Oh, hello.

3829
02:48:54,340 --> 02:48:55,280
Don't do it!

3830
02:48:55,660 --> 02:48:55,940
No!

3831
02:48:56,840 --> 02:48:57,880
Just get out of here.

3832
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:58,640
Yeah, come on, come on.

3833
02:48:59,800 --> 02:49:02,500
No, it's gonna get my warp tree!

3834
02:49:03,500 --> 02:49:03,820
No!

3835
02:49:03,820 --> 02:49:03,920
Woo!

3836
02:49:12,050 --> 02:49:13,210
Wait, did we get it?

3837
02:49:13,550 --> 02:49:14,510
Oh, man.

3838
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:15,530
What a waste.

3839
02:49:16,730 --> 02:49:17,430
Roar thief!

3840
02:49:17,950 --> 02:49:18,470
Ah!

3841
02:49:18,990 --> 02:49:19,730
I can't believe!

3842
02:49:22,830 --> 02:49:24,690
I wish I could grab-y-grab.

3843
02:49:25,890 --> 02:49:26,890
Okay, I'm gonna...

3844
02:49:26,890 --> 02:49:28,150
I'm gonna bring you back, buddy.

3845
02:49:29,990 --> 02:49:31,270
Let's just bring you back.

3846
02:49:31,450 --> 02:49:31,930
Hold on.

3847
02:49:35,130 --> 02:49:38,010
So high maintenance.

3848
02:49:38,590 --> 02:49:39,910
How do I get behind there?

3849
02:49:41,170 --> 02:49:41,650
Maybe...

3850
02:49:41,650 --> 02:49:42,450
It's like...

3851
02:49:42,450 --> 02:49:42,530
Oh!

3852
02:49:42,830 --> 02:49:43,450
Look at that!

3853
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:44,170
This appeared.

3854
02:49:45,130 --> 02:49:45,890
Did I miss this?

3855
02:49:45,990 --> 02:49:47,070
Or did it appear out of nowhere?

3856
02:49:51,210 --> 02:49:51,650
Um...

3857
02:49:55,330 --> 02:49:55,770
Wait.

3858
02:49:56,090 --> 02:49:57,090
I came from up above.

3859
02:49:57,330 --> 02:49:57,490
Wait.

3860
02:49:58,890 --> 02:50:00,790
Crawl through the gap like a normal person.

3861
02:50:00,890 --> 02:50:01,310
I know!

3862
02:50:01,570 --> 02:50:01,890
Come on!

3863
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:06,090
V, just get on your hands and knees.

3864
02:50:14,900 --> 02:50:16,880
Read in- Oh, you have to summon Nightmare!

3865
02:50:17,140 --> 02:50:20,100
Also, reading doesn't work, you guys, unless it's in battle.

3866
02:50:21,680 --> 02:50:23,700
Well, does taunt work unless it's in battle?

3867
02:50:23,800 --> 02:50:24,120
Let's see.

3868
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:26,760
It's a real...

3869
02:50:26,760 --> 02:50:27,660
Roarberry.

3870
02:50:29,960 --> 02:50:31,500
Running out of time.

3871
02:50:33,280 --> 02:50:34,160
Um...

3872
02:50:35,120 --> 02:50:35,700
No.

3873
02:50:35,980 --> 02:50:36,780
Doesn't seem to.

3874
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:37,840
That's lame.

3875
02:50:39,060 --> 02:50:39,320
No!

3876
02:50:39,740 --> 02:50:40,300
Nightmare!

3877
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:42,460
Huh.

3878
02:50:46,030 --> 02:50:46,890
A wheel.

3879
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:48,830
Put my...

3880
02:50:48,830 --> 02:50:50,530
Put my poor frag.

3881
02:50:51,410 --> 02:50:52,570
And then what else...

3882
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:53,770
Whatever else is down there.

3883
02:50:55,650 --> 02:50:56,090
Sorry.

3884
02:50:56,930 --> 02:50:58,010
The camera is so...

3885
02:50:58,010 --> 02:50:58,350
Icky.

3886
02:50:58,790 --> 02:50:59,690
Holy cow.

3887
02:51:01,010 --> 02:51:01,490
I thought the...

3888
02:51:01,490 --> 02:51:04,110
I thought I would be okay with the camera in this game, but...

3889
02:51:05,290 --> 02:51:05,770
Uh...

3890
02:51:05,770 --> 02:51:06,650
Doesn't seem like it.

3891
02:51:18,740 --> 02:51:20,300
Hey, those are my roar butts!

3892
02:51:27,190 --> 02:51:27,670
And...

3893
02:51:27,670 --> 02:51:28,610
Pusa Queen!

3894
02:51:37,400 --> 02:51:37,880
Whoa!

3895
02:51:58,090 --> 02:52:00,030
There he comes!

3896
02:52:02,810 --> 02:52:03,890
Go get him.

3897
02:52:03,890 --> 02:52:05,070
Go get him, tiger.

3898
02:52:06,390 --> 02:52:06,990
Panther.

3899
02:52:07,270 --> 02:52:08,230
Where is he going?

3900
02:52:09,390 --> 02:52:10,750
Queen, where are you going?

3901
02:52:11,910 --> 02:52:12,830
My queen!

3902
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:15,910
Where are you going?

3903
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:16,430
My queen!

3904
02:52:41,540 --> 02:52:42,780
I wish I could...

3905
02:52:42,780 --> 02:52:43,540
Like, I don't...

3906
02:52:43,540 --> 02:52:45,240
Do I have to like, be really close to them?

3907
02:52:45,360 --> 02:52:46,520
Because I feel like my...

3908
02:52:46,520 --> 02:52:48,160
Guys just like, run away.

3909
02:52:48,320 --> 02:52:48,800
You know what I mean?

3910
02:52:50,900 --> 02:52:52,220
What is she doing in the corner?

3911
02:52:56,720 --> 02:52:57,920
I can't finish her.

3912
02:52:58,360 --> 02:52:58,800
Unless...

3913
02:52:58,800 --> 02:52:59,480
Oh, now I can.

3914
02:53:06,460 --> 02:53:07,380
She was dead.

3915
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:08,640
I was trying to get her.

3916
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:12,880
Recommend locking on.

3917
02:53:12,880 --> 02:53:15,020
Okay, so I'll just lock on more, I suppose.

3918
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:16,880
Would be easier...

3919
02:53:19,100 --> 02:53:19,580
Then...

3920
02:53:25,250 --> 02:53:26,910
Now, can we get up there?

3921
02:53:33,880 --> 02:53:35,280
What's all this...

3922
02:53:35,280 --> 02:53:37,180
Am I supposed to be running or...

3923
02:53:38,420 --> 02:53:39,860
Why is the musical scary?

3924
02:53:41,360 --> 02:53:41,840
Come on!

3925
02:53:42,020 --> 02:53:42,560
Get it!

3926
02:53:46,180 --> 02:53:47,000
There we go.

3927
02:53:50,420 --> 02:53:51,260
Thank you.

3928
02:53:52,800 --> 02:53:54,260
Should I be running?

3929
02:53:54,540 --> 02:53:54,680
Oh.

3930
02:53:55,180 --> 02:53:56,420
There's another...

3931
02:53:57,940 --> 02:53:59,260
SIG to blow him up.

3932
02:54:02,700 --> 02:54:04,200
Very carefully now.

3933
02:54:06,780 --> 02:54:08,580
There must be an escape route.

3934
02:54:08,860 --> 02:54:10,940
Wait, I can fly this whole time?

3935
02:54:13,180 --> 02:54:15,400
Oh my god, I thought it was just a double jump.

3936
02:54:16,340 --> 02:54:18,620
This whole time, I could fly!

3937
02:54:21,600 --> 02:54:22,980
I feel so stupid.

3938
02:54:25,940 --> 02:54:27,240
Only for a little bit.

3939
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:29,420
Yeah, but like that was...

3940
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:36,380
You guys are so stupid.

3941
02:54:36,820 --> 02:54:38,280
Get this thing right here!

3942
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:41,380
It's more like a glide.

3943
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:42,360
But that's still huge.

3944
02:54:50,310 --> 02:54:51,290
Good job, team.

3945
02:54:51,810 --> 02:54:52,570
Good job, team.

3946
02:54:53,010 --> 02:54:53,810
Anything up here?

3947
02:54:54,030 --> 02:54:54,230
Nope.

3948
02:54:59,430 --> 02:55:00,230
Okie dokie.

3949
02:55:00,410 --> 02:55:01,550
Hey, what's in that hole?

3950
02:55:01,750 --> 02:55:02,490
Did we take a look?

3951
02:55:03,150 --> 02:55:04,770
Wait, there's robs there though.

3952
02:55:06,850 --> 02:55:07,750
See if I...

3953
02:55:07,750 --> 02:55:08,030
Let's see.

3954
02:55:12,090 --> 02:55:13,070
Yeah, see?

3955
02:55:13,310 --> 02:55:13,730
Like that.

3956
02:55:14,070 --> 02:55:14,730
Oh my gosh.

3957
02:55:17,110 --> 02:55:17,890
How long does it last?

3958
02:55:18,070 --> 02:55:18,230
Oh.

3959
02:55:18,790 --> 02:55:19,610
Wow, that's pretty good.

3960
02:55:19,610 --> 02:55:19,710
Good.

3961
02:55:26,050 --> 02:55:26,870
She shoots!

3962
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:28,810
She scores!

3963
02:55:29,490 --> 02:55:29,730
Yeah!

3964
02:55:30,430 --> 02:55:32,630
I was scared for a second.

3965
02:55:33,170 --> 02:55:34,730
Thought I wouldn't get that.

3966
02:55:39,710 --> 02:55:40,850
Three points.

3967
02:55:41,750 --> 02:55:45,310
I don't think that was three point range, but I'll take it.

3968
02:55:53,450 --> 02:55:54,970
Oh, that hurts me too.

3969
02:55:55,550 --> 02:55:56,090
Haha.

3970
02:55:59,710 --> 02:56:00,270
See?

3971
02:56:00,430 --> 02:56:00,910
I'm like...

3972
02:56:00,910 --> 02:56:01,210
They go...

3973
02:56:01,210 --> 02:56:02,210
They come so far away.

3974
02:56:15,970 --> 02:56:17,350
Stop running towards me.

3975
02:56:25,320 --> 02:56:26,720
Let's bring my friend in.

3976
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:28,960
Oh, he's coming in through the wall!

3977
02:56:29,620 --> 02:56:29,800
Yeah!

3978
02:56:40,250 --> 02:56:41,850
Oh yeah, I forgot I have to kill him.

3979
02:56:47,280 --> 02:56:47,720
Nice.

3980
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:49,560
Oh!

3981
02:56:49,880 --> 02:56:50,200
Oh!

3982
02:56:52,460 --> 02:56:54,180
Oh, I should've saved my friend for later.

3983
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:55,800
I should've saved my friend for later.

3984
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:57,380
I should've saved my friend for later.

3985
02:57:02,140 --> 02:57:05,120
Why are you green?

3986
02:57:05,300 --> 02:57:05,360
Oh!

3987
02:57:05,620 --> 02:57:06,640
That guy's healing you probably!

3988
02:57:10,600 --> 02:57:11,860
Oh my gosh, she's so fast.

3989
02:57:14,180 --> 02:57:14,620
No,

3990
02:57:17,970 --> 02:57:18,210
no, no.

3991
02:57:18,410 --> 02:57:18,670
Haha.

3992
02:57:20,310 --> 02:57:20,750
Oh, there we go.

3993
02:57:25,860 --> 02:57:26,660
Reading time.

3994
02:57:26,860 --> 02:57:27,180
I'm trying.

3995
02:57:28,580 --> 02:57:28,660
Oh.

3996
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:30,740
You left a little...

3997
02:57:30,740 --> 02:57:31,740
Worse for wear.

3998
02:57:40,310 --> 02:57:40,990
Read!

3999
02:57:47,950 --> 02:57:49,190
Holy cow.

4000
02:57:50,050 --> 02:57:50,810
Oh, ouch.

4001
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:00,060
Get her, get her, get her, get her!

4002
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:01,940
Nice.

4003
02:58:02,280 --> 02:58:02,760
And...

4004
02:58:02,760 --> 02:58:03,080
My turn?

4005
02:58:03,760 --> 02:58:04,680
Nope, not yet.

4006
02:58:05,600 --> 02:58:06,400
Now my turn.

4007
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:13,340
Nightmare my goat.

4008
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:14,600
Gosh, he's crazy!

4009
02:58:15,140 --> 02:58:17,000
Holy cow!

4010
02:58:18,980 --> 02:58:19,460
Oof!

4011
02:58:19,700 --> 02:58:20,640
Did you guys hear that dog?

4012
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:21,360
Oh!

4013
02:58:22,020 --> 02:58:22,500
Hahaha.

4014
02:58:27,290 --> 02:58:27,630
Okay.

4015
02:58:31,390 --> 02:58:32,850
Wait, which is...

4016
02:58:32,850 --> 02:58:32,990
Oh!

4017
02:58:33,170 --> 02:58:33,370
Oh!

4018
02:58:33,570 --> 02:58:33,830
Oh!

4019
02:58:34,530 --> 02:58:35,010
Oh!

4020
02:58:35,790 --> 02:58:35,850
Oh!

4021
02:58:36,310 --> 02:58:36,790
Oh!

4022
02:58:37,070 --> 02:58:37,330
Oh!

4023
02:58:37,330 --> 02:58:37,350
Oh!

4024
02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:37,830
Oh!

4025
02:58:39,810 --> 02:58:40,290
Oh!

4026
02:58:54,090 --> 02:58:54,610
Oh!

4027
02:58:54,730 --> 02:58:54,950
Hello!

4028
02:58:55,330 --> 02:58:56,050
Oh my gosh.

4029
02:59:07,030 --> 02:59:07,710
Thank you.

4030
02:59:07,810 --> 02:59:08,250
There we go.

4031
02:59:17,310 --> 02:59:18,490
There's a gorb!

4032
02:59:20,390 --> 02:59:20,910
Oh!

4033
02:59:21,130 --> 02:59:21,950
There's a gorb!

4034
02:59:22,630 --> 02:59:24,110
I miss it this whole time.

4035
02:59:24,110 --> 02:59:24,810
Hahaha.

4036
02:59:27,390 --> 02:59:28,070
Yay!

4037
02:59:29,710 --> 02:59:30,390
Oh!

4038
02:59:30,490 --> 02:59:30,990
There's more!

4039
02:59:32,490 --> 02:59:33,450
Go get him.

4040
02:59:33,590 --> 02:59:34,130
Go get him.

4041
02:59:34,230 --> 02:59:34,530
Tiger!

4042
02:59:34,930 --> 02:59:35,610
Panther!

4043
02:59:43,730 --> 02:59:44,410
Yeah!

4044
02:59:44,950 --> 02:59:46,390
Now I get his butt.

4045
02:59:46,710 --> 02:59:47,230
Hahaha.

4046
02:59:48,510 --> 02:59:50,170
Now I get his butt.

4047
02:59:57,160 --> 02:59:57,560
Oh!

4048
02:59:57,680 --> 02:59:57,700
Oh!

4049
02:59:57,700 --> 02:59:58,000
There's more!

4050
02:59:59,100 --> 03:00:02,960
Don't know why it went towards him like that.

4051
03:00:03,180 --> 03:00:03,440
Hahaha.

4052
03:00:04,080 --> 03:00:05,220
Except if I'm gonna do anything.

4053
03:00:07,720 --> 03:00:08,800
Come here, come here, come here.

4054
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:16,600
Get that butt!

4055
03:00:17,020 --> 03:00:18,000
Get that butt!

4056
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:19,400
Get that butt!

4057
03:00:19,600 --> 03:00:20,120
Get that butt!

4058
03:00:20,440 --> 03:00:21,380
Get him, get him, get him!

4059
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:22,460
Why aren't you guys doing anything?

4060
03:00:23,300 --> 03:00:23,560
Duh.

4061
03:00:24,540 --> 03:00:25,080
Fight!

4062
03:00:25,500 --> 03:00:25,620
Fight!

4063
03:00:26,020 --> 03:00:26,400
Fight!

4064
03:00:26,740 --> 03:00:27,080
Fight!

4065
03:00:27,260 --> 03:00:28,060
Get his butt!

4066
03:00:28,740 --> 03:00:29,380
Get the butt!

4067
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:30,180
Get the butt!

4068
03:00:32,700 --> 03:00:34,980
Okay, like go closer to him and do that again.

4069
03:00:35,380 --> 03:00:35,660
Yeah, yeah.

4070
03:00:35,980 --> 03:00:37,320
Do that, like really close.

4071
03:00:37,440 --> 03:00:38,520
Then my turn.

4072
03:00:43,800 --> 03:00:50,940
I think I prefer... Nero's song to... to V's song.

4073
03:00:51,480 --> 03:00:51,920
You know?

4074
03:00:52,740 --> 03:00:54,100
It's kind of disappointing.

4075
03:00:56,420 --> 03:00:58,560
I prefer Nero's song to V's song.

4076
03:00:59,160 --> 03:01:01,900
It's so much more... It hypes me up so much more.

4077
03:01:06,440 --> 03:01:07,340
Where do you see a phone?

4078
03:01:09,260 --> 03:01:09,940
Where are you... Oh.

4079
03:01:10,700 --> 03:01:11,240
Over there.

4080
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:12,600
I'm like, am I blind?

4081
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:17,480
Alright.

4082
03:01:18,860 --> 03:01:20,060
I like it, but yeah.

4083
03:01:20,180 --> 03:01:20,980
It's not that... Oh.

4084
03:01:21,720 --> 03:01:22,520
That was so close.

4085
03:01:22,700 --> 03:01:24,000
Not that I dislike it.

4086
03:01:24,260 --> 03:01:25,440
I just prefer...

4087
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:30,580
Prefer... Nero's.

4088
03:01:33,640 --> 03:01:34,800
Oh, he scared me.

4089
03:01:34,880 --> 03:01:36,760
I thought that was a guy coming after me.

4090
03:01:40,830 --> 03:01:42,230
What else we got around here?

4091
03:01:42,350 --> 03:01:42,550
Nothing.

4092
03:01:43,290 --> 03:01:44,310
Let's call her up.

4093
03:01:46,610 --> 03:01:48,050
You like V's song more?

4094
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:50,050
That's just a preference thing.

4095
03:01:59,130 --> 03:02:01,210
Hey, I could use a hand.

4096
03:02:01,810 --> 03:02:02,050
Oh?

4097
03:02:02,190 --> 03:02:02,950
You got it.

4098
03:02:03,190 --> 03:02:03,850
Wait right there.

4099
03:02:04,950 --> 03:02:07,470
He's... He's acting vulnerable right now.

4100
03:02:07,550 --> 03:02:08,010
Oh my god.

4101
03:02:08,010 --> 03:02:08,950
He's just chilling.

4102
03:02:09,250 --> 03:02:10,350
What's taking her so long?

4103
03:02:11,790 --> 03:02:12,210
Oh.

4104
03:02:20,380 --> 03:02:21,360
He's sensitive.

4105
03:02:32,380 --> 03:02:32,960
Um...

4106
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:34,220
What's up?

4107
03:02:34,420 --> 03:02:34,800
What's up?

4108
03:02:34,800 --> 03:02:34,800
Okay.

4109
03:02:35,520 --> 03:02:37,180
We're just gonna... Yeah.

4110
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:40,160
We're just... Yeah.

4111
03:02:42,380 --> 03:02:42,900
Yeah.

4112
03:02:43,520 --> 03:02:44,900
Wait, where did she come from?

4113
03:02:46,840 --> 03:02:47,360
Where...

4114
03:02:48,180 --> 03:02:49,460
Where did she come from?

4115
03:02:51,060 --> 03:02:53,200
Wait, can I get on top of this horse too?

4116
03:02:53,560 --> 03:02:54,520
For some more?

4117
03:02:56,400 --> 03:02:57,420
I don't see anything.

4118
03:02:59,840 --> 03:03:00,360
But...

4119
03:03:00,360 --> 03:03:01,400
The ground.

4120
03:03:01,580 --> 03:03:02,580
Yeah, but there's no hole.

4121
03:03:05,080 --> 03:03:05,880
Maybe not.

4122
03:03:09,640 --> 03:03:10,620
Where's the hole?

4123
03:03:14,660 --> 03:03:15,700
Alright, get in there.

4124
03:03:19,740 --> 03:03:25,280
Did you know that if you live within 3.5 kilometers of a graveyard, you legally can't be buried there?

4125
03:03:26,060 --> 03:03:28,200
Cause it's illegal to bury people while they're alive.

4126
03:03:28,440 --> 03:03:29,200
So, stop.

4127
03:03:31,760 --> 03:03:33,180
Oh my god.

4128
03:03:34,060 --> 03:03:35,940
Do we wanna ride Nightmare?

4129
03:03:36,540 --> 03:03:38,700
Or maybe I just upgrade Nightmare.

4130
03:03:41,080 --> 03:03:41,600
Bwee.

4131
03:03:41,720 --> 03:03:41,940
Bwee.

4132
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:43,260
Bwee.

4133
03:03:43,480 --> 03:03:43,740
Bwee.

4134
03:03:43,880 --> 03:03:44,220
Bwee.

4135
03:03:44,440 --> 03:03:44,700
Bwee.

4136
03:03:44,920 --> 03:03:45,120
Bwee.

4137
03:03:45,700 --> 03:03:46,220
Bwee.

4138
03:03:46,220 --> 03:03:48,600
Oh wait, but I have to have promotion for this.

4139
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:50,860
Uh...

4140
03:03:50,860 --> 03:03:52,120
Illegal move!

4141
03:03:52,880 --> 03:03:54,040
What does that mean?

4142
03:03:58,760 --> 03:04:00,460
Wait, does this also have to be promotion?

4143
03:04:04,430 --> 03:04:05,910
Cause I'm on... I'm on his back.

4144
03:04:06,050 --> 03:04:07,510
Does this also have to be during...

4145
03:04:08,890 --> 03:04:09,330
Promotion?

4146
03:04:12,590 --> 03:04:14,130
It hits below the belt.

4147
03:04:23,210 --> 03:04:24,330
Let's try it.

4148
03:04:28,610 --> 03:04:30,150
I have to keep going.

4149
03:04:32,270 --> 03:04:32,930
Whoa!

4150
03:04:34,750 --> 03:04:36,510
Wait, I kinda wanna see him.

4151
03:04:37,050 --> 03:04:37,710
Wait, wait, wait.

4152
03:04:38,840 --> 03:04:39,690
He's so cute!

4153
03:04:40,850 --> 03:04:42,150
Now hold B!

4154
03:04:42,790 --> 03:04:43,790
I'm holding B.

4155
03:04:46,330 --> 03:04:47,650
Gosh, his...

4156
03:04:47,650 --> 03:04:48,710
Booty!

4157
03:04:51,630 --> 03:04:52,290
Um...

4158
03:04:53,610 --> 03:04:55,690
Okay, I think I do have to...

4159
03:05:00,990 --> 03:05:02,050
Wait, I didn't...

4160
03:05:02,050 --> 03:05:02,830
I didn't figure...

4161
03:05:02,830 --> 03:05:03,950
I didn't learn how to...

4162
03:05:03,950 --> 03:05:05,470
How to get on top of him.

4163
03:05:07,570 --> 03:05:10,370
So, 100% you need promotion to do this.

4164
03:05:12,090 --> 03:05:14,860
But I don't think I can do it in there if I...

4165
03:05:15,610 --> 03:05:16,970
Don't have it already.

4166
03:05:16,970 --> 03:05:17,570
You know what I mean?

4167
03:05:19,050 --> 03:05:20,450
L, B, B.

4168
03:05:21,550 --> 03:05:22,870
Or A in the air.

4169
03:05:31,140 --> 03:05:32,520
I wanna try it.

4170
03:05:33,680 --> 03:05:34,880
At the very least.

4171
03:05:36,760 --> 03:05:38,080
Alright, come here, baby!

4172
03:05:39,880 --> 03:05:40,280
Alright.

4173
03:05:41,780 --> 03:05:42,520
I'm on him!

4174
03:05:45,060 --> 03:05:45,920
Here we go!

4175
03:05:56,900 --> 03:05:58,680
Okay, so he only fights with B.

4176
03:05:58,680 --> 03:05:59,100
Okay.

4177
03:05:59,800 --> 03:06:00,500
Smack!

4178
03:06:00,840 --> 03:06:01,160
Smack!

4179
03:06:01,680 --> 03:06:01,960
Smack!

4180
03:06:03,430 --> 03:06:03,780
Smack!

4181
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:05,560
What if I...

4182
03:06:05,560 --> 03:06:06,500
Smack him on...

4183
03:06:06,500 --> 03:06:07,620
Oh!

4184
03:06:09,430 --> 03:06:09,780
Bye!

4185
03:06:12,240 --> 03:06:12,940
Hmm...

4186
03:06:12,940 --> 03:06:14,720
Not a personal fan of promotion.

4187
03:06:14,880 --> 03:06:15,660
I feel...

4188
03:06:15,660 --> 03:06:16,560
That it's just...

4189
03:06:16,560 --> 03:06:18,020
Easier to...

4190
03:06:18,020 --> 03:06:19,340
Let him do his own thing.

4191
03:06:21,490 --> 03:06:22,000
You know?

4192
03:06:22,200 --> 03:06:23,120
Let him, like...

4193
03:06:23,350 --> 03:06:23,700
Just...

4194
03:06:23,700 --> 03:06:25,180
Be his little baby self.

4195
03:06:29,690 --> 03:06:32,530
Because otherwise, I'm controlling three things at the same time.

4196
03:06:34,030 --> 03:06:35,710
Like, holy cow!

4197
03:06:36,650 --> 03:06:38,610
Oh yeah, I should buy a poor Pong.

4198
03:06:41,350 --> 03:06:41,830
Yeah.

4199
03:06:48,050 --> 03:06:50,590
Even though he's a giant, nightmare is still my favorite little guy.

4200
03:06:50,970 --> 03:06:51,210
Yeah.

4201
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:52,530
No, no, not yet.

4202
03:06:53,910 --> 03:06:54,790
Maybe I...

4203
03:06:54,790 --> 03:06:55,930
Wait, what does Shadow have extra?

4204
03:06:56,570 --> 03:06:57,450
What's a new thing?

4205
03:07:00,750 --> 03:07:01,750
Oh, okay, that.

4206
03:07:02,650 --> 03:07:03,390
Oh, I know.

4207
03:07:03,470 --> 03:07:04,590
I saw Griffin had that too.

4208
03:07:08,490 --> 03:07:08,970
Hmm...

4209
03:07:08,970 --> 03:07:10,430
Could just buy more...

4210
03:07:11,570 --> 03:07:12,050
Porps...

4211
03:07:15,010 --> 03:07:17,210
Spinning charge that transforms Shadow's body.

4212
03:07:18,530 --> 03:07:18,870
Whoa!

4213
03:07:19,470 --> 03:07:19,690
Oh!

4214
03:07:22,590 --> 03:07:23,070
So...

4215
03:07:23,070 --> 03:07:24,490
Forward or back plus Y.

4216
03:07:24,710 --> 03:07:25,870
Wait, that sounds pretty good, no?

4217
03:07:28,930 --> 03:07:30,750
We could get this and then Porps.

4218
03:07:45,500 --> 03:07:45,980
Hmm...

4219
03:07:46,760 --> 03:07:48,320
Oh my god, his head!

4220
03:07:50,700 --> 03:07:51,960
This is a monkey D.

4221
03:07:52,060 --> 03:07:52,360
Luffy!

4222
03:07:57,760 --> 03:07:59,440
Wait, was this only in mid-air?

4223
03:08:00,520 --> 03:08:01,080
Uh...

4224
03:08:02,060 --> 03:08:03,700
Oh, and in mid-air.

4225
03:08:03,860 --> 03:08:04,420
Oh my gosh.

4226
03:08:04,760 --> 03:08:05,540
Wait, so...

4227
03:08:05,540 --> 03:08:07,880
We have to hope that he's in mid-air.

4228
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:08,720
Oh, that's crazy.

4229
03:08:21,310 --> 03:08:22,950
As long as possible.

4230
03:08:23,950 --> 03:08:25,210
That's a long time.

4231
03:08:27,370 --> 03:08:27,930
Hmm...

4232
03:08:27,930 --> 03:08:30,630
But I think I might just do the Porp.

4233
03:08:30,810 --> 03:08:32,470
Let's buy that at least one.

4234
03:08:33,050 --> 03:08:34,070
Buy one Porp.

4235
03:08:36,450 --> 03:08:37,570
And then...

4236
03:08:37,570 --> 03:08:37,970
Whoa!

4237
03:08:37,970 --> 03:08:38,050
Whoa!

4238
03:08:38,750 --> 03:08:40,410
Thank you so much for the bread!

4239
03:08:41,210 --> 03:08:42,370
Ice cream...

4240
03:08:44,170 --> 03:08:45,670
Ice cream...

4241
03:08:45,670 --> 03:08:46,350
Ice cream...

4242
03:08:46,350 --> 03:08:47,150
Minto-chan?

4243
03:08:47,650 --> 03:08:48,010
Hi!

4244
03:08:48,550 --> 03:08:49,670
What do you like?

4245
03:08:50,310 --> 03:08:51,770
This is Minto!

4246
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:52,610
You can...

4247
03:09:03,800 --> 03:09:04,760
Um...

4248
03:09:04,760 --> 03:09:05,200
Woah!

4249
03:09:05,620 --> 03:09:09,220
Meno-meno-meno-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo...

4250
03:09:09,220 --> 03:09:10,220
Oh my gosh...

4251
03:09:10,220 --> 03:09:12,860
I can't stop watching that one lady in oblivion.

4252
03:09:12,960 --> 03:09:15,360
Oh, I'm gonna try oblivion tomorrow, you guys.

4253
03:09:16,880 --> 03:09:18,860
I'm gonna try oblivion tomorrow.

4254
03:09:19,580 --> 03:09:21,580
It's my first time ever playing it.

4255
03:09:21,820 --> 03:09:23,200
Playing any...

4256
03:09:23,200 --> 03:09:24,720
Elder Scrolls game.

4257
03:09:25,880 --> 03:09:27,260
So I'm nervous.

4258
03:09:27,720 --> 03:09:29,660
But I want to try it.

4259
03:09:30,020 --> 03:09:41,700
And then... And then... But I can't stop watching the clips of this one lizard lady.

4260
03:09:42,340 --> 03:09:43,640
Dorygo, thank you so much for the tech.

4261
03:09:43,800 --> 03:09:48,060
I can't stop watching this one lizard lady.

4262
03:09:48,320 --> 03:09:49,900
And she goes...

4263
03:10:01,300 --> 03:10:06,680
So now... So now I'll like run around my maid cafe.

4264
03:10:06,960 --> 03:10:08,620
Like if I'm chasing my cats.

4265
03:10:08,740 --> 03:10:09,540
And I'll just go...

4266
03:10:17,710 --> 03:10:19,030
I'm obsessed with it.

4267
03:10:19,110 --> 03:10:20,250
I hope I get to meet her.

4268
03:10:21,770 --> 03:10:23,170
I hope I get to meet her.

4269
03:10:24,550 --> 03:10:26,030
Maybe I get this.

4270
03:10:27,230 --> 03:10:27,670
And...

4271
03:10:32,390 --> 03:10:33,370
We have that.

4272
03:10:34,450 --> 03:10:35,430
Back to forward.

4273
03:10:36,330 --> 03:10:38,170
Maybe we get this...

4274
03:10:42,370 --> 03:10:44,690
Because it's just... Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why.

4275
03:10:44,770 --> 03:10:46,130
It's my Nero move.

4276
03:10:50,010 --> 03:10:50,830
I'll try it.

4277
03:10:52,510 --> 03:10:52,990
Uh...

4278
03:10:54,490 --> 03:10:54,970
Yes.

4279
03:11:01,110 --> 03:11:01,590
Okay.

4280
03:11:02,670 --> 03:11:03,790
Are we good to go?

4281
03:11:05,210 --> 03:11:05,690
Sorry.

4282
03:11:05,950 --> 03:11:06,790
Sorry, excuse me.

4283
03:11:07,470 --> 03:11:08,250
Excuse me.

4284
03:11:08,990 --> 03:11:09,590
Can I go in here?

4285
03:11:09,910 --> 03:11:10,830
Is this a wall?

4286
03:11:11,030 --> 03:11:11,690
Oh, it is.

4287
03:11:12,110 --> 03:11:12,210
Oh!

4288
03:11:13,410 --> 03:11:15,330
I like how we can still hear her music.

4289
03:11:15,630 --> 03:11:15,690
Oh!

4290
03:11:20,910 --> 03:11:21,470
Malthus!

4291
03:11:21,670 --> 03:11:23,370
Of course, war trouble.

4292
03:11:24,090 --> 03:11:25,850
Not sure about that one though.

4293
03:11:25,950 --> 03:11:26,790
Never seen it before.

4294
03:11:26,910 --> 03:11:28,190
Not in the other world anyway!

4295
03:11:29,610 --> 03:11:30,170
Shhh!

4296
03:11:30,490 --> 03:11:33,330
Search for the devil's sword, Sparta.

4297
03:11:34,190 --> 03:11:36,290
You know where it is.

4298
03:11:36,630 --> 03:11:38,610
He told me to leave it be.

4299
03:11:38,610 --> 03:11:42,690
But I'm afraid it still concerns me.

4300
03:11:43,510 --> 03:11:46,950
As long as there is a blood descendant of Sparta...

4301
03:11:46,950 --> 03:11:47,150
Huh?

4302
03:11:47,610 --> 03:11:50,670
I cannot take any chances.

4303
03:11:51,650 --> 03:11:53,510
Do you understand?

4304
03:11:53,930 --> 03:11:54,410
Whoa!

4305
03:11:54,950 --> 03:11:55,910
Find it...

4306
03:11:56,550 --> 03:11:58,330
And destroy it!

4307
03:11:59,570 --> 03:12:00,870
Only then...

4308
03:12:00,870 --> 03:12:03,850
Will his brain be truly realized.

4309
03:12:04,290 --> 03:12:04,810
Eww!

4310
03:12:04,810 --> 03:12:05,290
Eww!

4311
03:12:11,050 --> 03:12:11,670
Dang!

4312
03:12:13,030 --> 03:12:13,650
Oh!

4313
03:12:14,570 --> 03:12:16,530
Guess we gotta take care of this guy first.

4314
03:12:18,870 --> 03:12:19,870
Oh my god!

4315
03:12:19,950 --> 03:12:20,810
He's so cool!

4316
03:12:26,690 --> 03:12:28,530
Elder Gryon Knight!

4317
03:12:29,670 --> 03:12:30,290
Whoa!

4318
03:12:31,230 --> 03:12:31,850
I see.

4319
03:12:32,550 --> 03:12:34,050
I know what you are.

4320
03:12:34,850 --> 03:12:35,330
Don't worry.

4321
03:12:35,330 --> 03:12:36,270
I know what you are.

4322
03:12:39,030 --> 03:12:40,110
I'll be gentle.

4323
03:12:40,250 --> 03:12:41,370
I know what you are.

4324
03:12:43,670 --> 03:12:44,430
I don't know.

4325
03:12:53,650 --> 03:12:54,610
Let's bring...

4326
03:12:54,610 --> 03:12:55,750
Our friend out.

4327
03:12:56,030 --> 03:12:56,490
Keep going.

4328
03:12:57,070 --> 03:12:57,230
Woo!

4329
03:12:57,590 --> 03:12:57,710
Woo!

4330
03:12:59,730 --> 03:13:00,750
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!

4331
03:13:01,310 --> 03:13:02,130
Get me outta here.

4332
03:13:03,130 --> 03:13:03,610
Oh,

4333
03:13:11,810 --> 03:13:12,270
this creature...

4334
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:13,550
Bring... bring the book out.

4335
03:13:13,790 --> 03:13:14,730
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

4336
03:13:14,730 --> 03:13:17,600
So, you thought...

4337
03:13:18,220 --> 03:13:18,700
Feels immense.

4338
03:13:19,520 --> 03:13:21,860
It's not the type of poetry...

4339
03:13:21,860 --> 03:13:22,960
Wait, what am I gonna say?

4340
03:13:23,580 --> 03:13:24,760
Where there's a will...

4341
03:13:24,760 --> 03:13:25,520
There's a way.

4342
03:13:26,100 --> 03:13:26,880
Let's go.

4343
03:13:27,300 --> 03:13:27,940
Nice.

4344
03:13:28,360 --> 03:13:29,000
Nice.

4345
03:13:29,860 --> 03:13:30,820
What's happening?

4346
03:13:31,060 --> 03:13:31,740
Holy cow!

4347
03:13:32,280 --> 03:13:33,040
What's going on?

4348
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:36,260
Is that water though?

4349
03:13:36,820 --> 03:13:37,420
Oh my god.

4350
03:13:48,070 --> 03:13:50,990
Is this that stickin' horse?

4351
03:13:51,750 --> 03:13:57,050
A rare species, but apparently not quite extinct.

4352
03:13:57,450 --> 03:13:57,950
Ah, dang it.

4353
03:14:01,750 --> 03:14:03,450
Dice, slice, and dice him.

4354
03:14:03,670 --> 03:14:04,010
Guys!

4355
03:14:05,430 --> 03:14:06,830
Send him right back.

4356
03:14:08,390 --> 03:14:09,530
Wait, what is that?

4357
03:14:09,650 --> 03:14:10,570
What's that thing that's growing?

4358
03:14:11,170 --> 03:14:11,630
What is it?

4359
03:14:12,070 --> 03:14:13,090
What is the thing that's growing?

4360
03:14:21,480 --> 03:14:21,920
Woo!

4361
03:14:32,180 --> 03:14:33,080
Oh, but he's back.

4362
03:14:33,480 --> 03:14:34,020
We're fine.

4363
03:14:34,340 --> 03:14:34,880
Everything's fine.

4364
03:14:36,720 --> 03:14:37,340
Oh, dang it!

4365
03:14:37,380 --> 03:14:39,240
I just noticed that I was doing that combo.

4366
03:14:47,610 --> 03:14:48,530
Catch freaking it.

4367
03:14:51,530 --> 03:14:52,450
Holy cow.

4368
03:14:53,550 --> 03:14:54,570
Get me outta here!

4369
03:14:54,930 --> 03:14:55,830
Get me outta here!

4370
03:15:01,760 --> 03:15:02,880
I think I might wanna.

4371
03:15:03,080 --> 03:15:03,620
There we go.

4372
03:15:10,060 --> 03:15:10,280
Ah!

4373
03:15:10,580 --> 03:15:10,840
Ouch.

4374
03:15:23,800 --> 03:15:24,080
Oh

4375
03:15:31,780 --> 03:15:32,680
my gosh.

4376
03:15:33,340 --> 03:15:34,300
Oh no, my cat!

4377
03:15:34,540 --> 03:15:35,320
Or my bird!

4378
03:15:36,540 --> 03:15:37,420
My bird!

4379
03:15:39,740 --> 03:15:40,680
Oh my gosh.

4380
03:15:42,280 --> 03:15:43,260
Holy cow.

4381
03:15:44,680 --> 03:15:45,780
Oh my god.

4382
03:15:45,920 --> 03:15:46,680
What is happening here?

4383
03:15:47,180 --> 03:15:48,020
My bird's back!

4384
03:15:52,980 --> 03:15:54,180
My bird!

4385
03:15:57,450 --> 03:15:57,820
Oh!

4386
03:15:58,420 --> 03:15:59,460
Holy cow!

4387
03:16:06,650 --> 03:16:08,290
Come on, you guys!

4388
03:16:08,290 --> 03:16:08,450
Please!

4389
03:16:12,870 --> 03:16:16,350
Slice- Slice- Get!

4390
03:16:16,370 --> 03:16:17,250
Get, Get em!

4391
03:16:17,650 --> 03:16:18,590
Get em!

4392
03:16:21,950 --> 03:16:24,370
There we go, there we go, there we go, there we go, there we go!

4393
03:16:26,970 --> 03:16:27,770
And me!

4394
03:16:28,090 --> 03:16:28,690
My turn!

4395
03:16:28,930 --> 03:16:29,290
My turn?

4396
03:16:29,470 --> 03:16:29,970
My turn?

4397
03:16:30,070 --> 03:16:30,810
My turn almost.

4398
03:16:33,610 --> 03:16:35,790
Oh my gosh, that the big- The big damage!

4399
03:16:36,310 --> 03:16:37,250
Wait, when is it my turn?

4400
03:16:37,250 --> 03:16:43,370
What's up, I'm not... Not yet.

4401
03:16:43,910 --> 03:16:44,510
Close.

4402
03:16:44,870 --> 03:16:45,270
Close.

4403
03:16:46,010 --> 03:16:46,570
Oh!

4404
03:16:47,870 --> 03:16:49,910
Oh my gosh, I'm trapped in here!

4405
03:16:52,650 --> 03:16:54,030
Oh my animals are dead.

4406
03:16:54,370 --> 03:16:54,810
Oh shoot.

4407
03:16:57,350 --> 03:16:58,390
Come on guys!

4408
03:16:58,690 --> 03:17:00,130
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

4409
03:17:00,210 --> 03:17:01,090
Wake up!

4410
03:17:04,470 --> 03:17:05,490
Wake up!

4411
03:17:05,490 --> 03:17:05,790
Wake up!

4412
03:17:06,810 --> 03:17:07,690
That's awkward.

4413
03:17:07,950 --> 03:17:10,030
I can't do anything right now.

4414
03:17:10,430 --> 03:17:11,990
I don't want to be in the slow-mo zone.

4415
03:17:14,410 --> 03:17:15,090
Oh gosh.

4416
03:17:24,600 --> 03:17:26,540
I'm trying to dodge, but I can't.

4417
03:17:27,160 --> 03:17:28,920
Oh my gosh, this is so bad.

4418
03:17:33,040 --> 03:17:34,980
This is so bad, you guys!

4419
03:17:35,880 --> 03:17:37,260
This is so bad!

4420
03:17:37,560 --> 03:17:38,440
My animals!

4421
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:39,780
Come back!

4422
03:17:44,960 --> 03:17:45,600
He's back!!!

4423
03:17:45,600 --> 03:17:46,360
He is back!!!

4424
03:17:46,360 --> 03:17:50,280
Oh my God, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die!

4425
03:17:55,610 --> 03:17:56,250
Holy cow!

4426
03:18:03,910 --> 03:18:05,470
Oh my god.

4427
03:18:05,990 --> 03:18:14,430
Oh my... I was just trying to build DT.

4428
03:18:16,690 --> 03:18:18,170
I'm not fine.

4429
03:18:19,470 --> 03:18:20,990
I'm not fine.

4430
03:18:21,230 --> 03:18:22,510
I'm not okay.

4431
03:18:25,810 --> 03:18:27,290
Well done, Gamer.

4432
03:18:27,590 --> 03:18:28,510
Thank you.

4433
03:18:38,090 --> 03:18:39,370
Sucky, thank you.

4434
03:18:39,690 --> 03:18:40,210
Thanks for the gift.

4435
03:18:43,170 --> 03:18:44,250
The boy.

4436
03:18:45,150 --> 03:18:46,530
What of the boy?

4437
03:18:47,150 --> 03:18:48,130
The boy.

4438
03:18:48,990 --> 03:18:49,950
Oh, Nero.

4439
03:18:53,790 --> 03:18:54,610
Give me that.

4440
03:18:54,830 --> 03:18:55,430
What is that?

4441
03:18:57,990 --> 03:18:59,730
Now do I get the control time?

4442
03:19:01,910 --> 03:19:03,410
Meep, thank you so much for the 515.

4443
03:19:04,150 --> 03:19:06,130
Congratulations on avoiding all the spoilers.

4444
03:19:06,470 --> 03:19:06,830
Wait, what?

4445
03:19:07,090 --> 03:19:12,630
Once we are near the Sparta, even I should be able to sense its presence.

4446
03:19:24,700 --> 03:19:26,180
We clutched that, you guys.

4447
03:19:26,400 --> 03:19:27,200
That was pretty...

4448
03:19:27,200 --> 03:19:30,420
That was pretty spooky scary.

4449
03:19:31,500 --> 03:19:32,440
Oh.

4450
03:19:33,700 --> 03:19:35,600
No continues bonus.

4451
03:19:35,980 --> 03:19:36,820
Hehehehe.

4452
03:19:37,960 --> 03:19:38,900
Wow.

4453
03:19:39,360 --> 03:19:40,640
Risk taker.

4454
03:19:41,200 --> 03:19:42,420
No running.

4455
03:19:42,840 --> 03:19:44,240
Yeah, but not by choice.

4456
03:19:45,660 --> 03:19:46,140
Oh.

4457
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:54,220
We're switching back already?

4458
03:19:57,480 --> 03:19:59,700
Wait, but I just got used to him.

4459
03:20:00,240 --> 03:20:00,260
Hahaha.

4460
03:20:01,820 --> 03:20:02,460
Oh, no.

4461
03:20:03,080 --> 03:20:04,840
I just got used to him.

4462
03:20:09,650 --> 03:20:11,210
Wait, do we got a new piece?

4463
03:20:11,570 --> 03:20:11,970
Hey.

4464
03:20:12,730 --> 03:20:14,610
I got a new arm for ya.

4465
03:20:14,810 --> 03:20:15,510
Was it...

4466
03:20:15,510 --> 03:20:16,490
Tomboy?

4467
03:20:18,750 --> 03:20:19,350
And...

4468
03:20:19,350 --> 03:20:20,530
Buster Arm.

4469
03:20:20,530 --> 03:20:20,690
No.

4470
03:20:20,950 --> 03:20:23,110
I really worked out a sweat on that one.

4471
03:20:27,180 --> 03:20:27,600
Okay.

4472
03:20:30,740 --> 03:20:31,440
I can't...

4473
03:20:31,440 --> 03:20:33,040
I don't have enough space for all these.

4474
03:20:36,640 --> 03:20:37,060
Uh...

4475
03:20:38,120 --> 03:20:38,960
I guess...

4476
03:20:38,960 --> 03:20:39,080
Wait.

4477
03:20:39,280 --> 03:20:40,480
How much is it to...

4478
03:20:40,480 --> 03:20:41,080
Get a new...

4479
03:20:41,080 --> 03:20:42,640
I guess we could get a new spot...

4480
03:20:42,640 --> 03:20:42,980
Slot.

4481
03:20:46,540 --> 03:20:46,960
Hmm...

4482
03:20:50,280 --> 03:20:51,340
Try them out in the void.

4483
03:20:51,340 --> 03:20:52,080
Yeah, I will.

4484
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:54,280
But...

4485
03:20:56,140 --> 03:20:59,340
I'm just making sure there's nothing else that I wanted to get while...

4486
03:21:00,620 --> 03:21:01,500
I guess...

4487
03:21:01,500 --> 03:21:03,740
If I really want to save up for Wiresnatch.

4488
03:21:06,420 --> 03:21:07,240
Don't worry guys.

4489
03:21:07,380 --> 03:21:07,960
We'll try them out.

4490
03:21:08,140 --> 03:21:08,640
We'll try them out.

4491
03:21:15,040 --> 03:21:16,640
Let's take out a youth.

4492
03:21:17,700 --> 03:21:19,000
We'll just switch these out.

4493
03:21:20,180 --> 03:21:20,800
Oh, oh.

4494
03:21:23,760 --> 03:21:24,160
Okay.

4495
03:21:24,360 --> 03:21:24,400
Oh.

4496
03:21:24,540 --> 03:21:24,900
No, no, no.

4497
03:21:25,960 --> 03:21:27,040
To the void!

4498
03:21:28,640 --> 03:21:29,880
To the void!

4499
03:21:33,540 --> 03:21:34,280
To the void!

4500
03:21:34,380 --> 03:21:34,820
To the void!

4501
03:21:42,520 --> 03:21:42,920
Oh.

4502
03:21:43,080 --> 03:21:43,560
Oh, sorry.

4503
03:21:45,100 --> 03:21:46,460
I was like...

4504
03:21:46,460 --> 03:21:47,440
There we go.

4505
03:21:48,260 --> 03:21:48,660
Okay.

4506
03:21:51,020 --> 03:21:51,420
Wait.

4507
03:21:51,600 --> 03:21:52,040
No, wait.

4508
03:21:52,200 --> 03:21:52,300
Oh.

4509
03:21:52,480 --> 03:21:53,500
I forgot to...

4510
03:21:53,500 --> 03:21:54,000
Wait.

4511
03:21:54,220 --> 03:21:54,580
Hold on.

4512
03:21:54,600 --> 03:21:55,100
I jump.

4513
03:21:56,580 --> 03:21:56,980
Jump.

4514
03:21:57,280 --> 03:21:57,380
B.

4515
03:21:58,200 --> 03:21:58,560
Wait.

4516
03:21:58,780 --> 03:22:00,080
How am I supposed to jump B?

4517
03:22:09,980 --> 03:22:11,440
Am I charging it long enough?

4518
03:22:12,460 --> 03:22:13,280
Oh, there we go.

4519
03:22:15,040 --> 03:22:15,740
Okay.

4520
03:22:23,610 --> 03:22:25,010
Charge.

4521
03:22:28,070 --> 03:22:29,470
Helter Sculter.

4522
03:22:30,110 --> 03:22:30,410
Charge.

4523
03:22:31,910 --> 03:22:32,150
Charge.

4524
03:22:35,130 --> 03:22:35,950
Tomboy.

4525
03:22:39,470 --> 03:22:40,370
Wait, what?

4526
03:22:43,710 --> 03:22:44,770
Does it do the rev for me?

4527
03:22:44,770 --> 03:22:45,610
Does it, like...

4528
03:22:45,610 --> 03:22:46,590
Do the rev for me?

4529
03:22:47,930 --> 03:22:49,630
It charges my moves?

4530
03:22:49,630 --> 03:22:49,970
It charges my moves!

4531
03:22:53,830 --> 03:22:55,130
Max rev!

4532
03:22:56,130 --> 03:22:57,210
Until when?

4533
03:22:57,590 --> 03:22:58,470
For how long?

4534
03:23:07,370 --> 03:23:08,750
Try the revolver, wait...

4535
03:23:20,830 --> 03:23:21,910
Try your gun.

4536
03:23:26,450 --> 03:23:27,670
I can't aim.

4537
03:23:27,850 --> 03:23:28,570
You guys, I can't aim.

4538
03:23:28,730 --> 03:23:29,410
I can't aim.

4539
03:23:29,690 --> 03:23:30,630
You guys, I can't...

4540
03:23:36,580 --> 03:23:37,540
That's crazy.

4541
03:23:39,660 --> 03:23:40,980
And then this is it.

4542
03:23:46,040 --> 03:23:47,080
No way.

4543
03:23:47,080 --> 03:23:47,320
No way.

4544
03:23:48,640 --> 03:23:49,460
Oh...

4545
03:23:49,460 --> 03:23:51,220
My god.

4546
03:23:52,750 --> 03:23:54,560
Just like DMZ4!

4547
03:24:06,290 --> 03:24:07,930
It feels so good.

4548
03:24:12,680 --> 03:24:15,520
Oh my god, just like DMZ4.

4549
03:24:18,120 --> 03:24:19,260
Let's reset.

4550
03:24:22,440 --> 03:24:24,800
I should probably just do like a separate build out.

4551
03:24:25,120 --> 03:24:27,760
Like, or load out for, uh...

4552
03:24:27,760 --> 03:24:29,540
For, um...

4553
03:24:31,160 --> 03:24:33,840
Gosh, punchline takes a long time to...

4554
03:24:35,700 --> 03:24:36,720
To rev up.

4555
03:24:36,920 --> 03:24:37,680
It's kind of crazy.

4556
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:39,680
Let's see.

4557
03:24:47,210 --> 03:24:49,090
Helter Skelter.

4558
03:24:54,870 --> 03:24:56,270
Okay.

4559
03:24:59,050 --> 03:25:00,190
Gosh!

4560
03:25:00,410 --> 03:25:01,690
I love Tomboy!

4561
03:25:03,490 --> 03:25:05,730
I love Tomboy!

4562
03:25:05,730 --> 03:25:07,050
I love Tomboy!

4563
03:25:10,250 --> 03:25:11,790
Oh my god!

4564
03:25:35,370 --> 03:25:36,050
Wow!

4565
03:25:40,890 --> 03:25:42,250
When does it stop?

4566
03:25:43,070 --> 03:25:44,350
When I tell it to.

4567
03:25:45,350 --> 03:25:46,550
But it just stays?

4568
03:25:46,890 --> 03:25:48,170
There's like...

4569
03:25:49,010 --> 03:25:50,730
Wait, so I have a question though.

4570
03:25:51,870 --> 03:25:52,750
Don't you...

4571
03:25:52,750 --> 03:25:54,410
Doesn't it break if you...

4572
03:25:54,410 --> 03:25:55,670
Get hit?

4573
03:25:56,550 --> 03:25:57,030
So...

4574
03:25:57,030 --> 03:25:58,750
If I got hit, then it would break.

4575
03:25:59,210 --> 03:25:59,650
Okay.

4576
03:25:59,850 --> 03:26:00,570
Okay, so I...

4577
03:26:00,570 --> 03:26:01,670
Okay, so that is the...

4578
03:26:01,670 --> 03:26:01,870
Okay.

4579
03:26:02,090 --> 03:26:02,230
Oh!

4580
03:26:02,730 --> 03:26:03,210
Golly!

4581
03:26:03,850 --> 03:26:04,330
Okay.

4582
03:26:04,550 --> 03:26:04,830
Alright!

4583
03:26:05,710 --> 03:26:06,510
Okay, okay.

4584
03:26:06,750 --> 03:26:07,090
Alright.

4585
03:26:07,090 --> 03:26:08,090
I was gonna say...

4586
03:26:08,090 --> 03:26:09,670
It just feels broken otherwise.

4587
03:26:15,330 --> 03:26:15,850
Uh...

4588
03:26:15,850 --> 03:26:16,170
Hold on.

4589
03:26:16,370 --> 03:26:16,490
Wait.

4590
03:26:16,730 --> 03:26:17,190
I can't...

4591
03:26:17,190 --> 03:26:17,290
Oh!

4592
03:26:17,370 --> 03:26:18,190
You can't move!

4593
03:26:18,810 --> 03:26:19,910
So I'm trapped?

4594
03:26:22,150 --> 03:26:23,490
I'm currently trapped?

4595
03:26:23,710 --> 03:26:24,490
I'm currently trapped?

4596
03:26:24,650 --> 03:26:26,470
I can't walk side to side at all?

4597
03:26:28,050 --> 03:26:29,190
That kinda sucks.

4598
03:26:37,010 --> 03:26:38,570
You have to jump out of it?

4599
03:26:38,570 --> 03:26:39,090
Wait.

4600
03:26:39,090 --> 03:26:39,150
Wait.

4601
03:26:39,170 --> 03:26:39,530
What do you mean?

4602
03:26:40,510 --> 03:26:41,750
Oh, you can charge the guy.

4603
03:26:42,010 --> 03:26:42,470
Oh, wait.

4604
03:26:42,550 --> 03:26:42,730
Hold on.

4605
03:26:42,790 --> 03:26:43,430
I wanna try that.

4606
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:01,340
Let's hit it.

4607
03:27:06,180 --> 03:27:07,060
I'll turn a scouter!

4608
03:27:09,020 --> 03:27:09,860
I'll beat a Brit...

4609
03:27:09,860 --> 03:27:09,980
Oh!

4610
03:27:10,100 --> 03:27:10,380
That's right!

4611
03:27:10,500 --> 03:27:11,400
Cause you can throw it anyway.

4612
03:27:12,540 --> 03:27:13,420
I forgot about that.

4613
03:27:13,500 --> 03:27:13,760
Thank you.

4614
03:27:14,740 --> 03:27:16,040
But I don't wanna remember that.

4615
03:27:16,180 --> 03:27:17,260
Actually, I don't wanna remember that.

4616
03:27:17,340 --> 03:27:19,320
Because I don't wanna just be breaking arms willy-nilly.

4617
03:27:21,900 --> 03:27:22,220
Um...

4618
03:27:22,220 --> 03:27:22,720
Okay.

4619
03:27:24,780 --> 03:27:25,100
Charge.

4620
03:27:33,370 --> 03:27:33,690
Ah!

4621
03:27:35,270 --> 03:27:36,210
I see, I see.

4622
03:27:37,550 --> 03:27:37,870
Ah!

4623
03:27:38,770 --> 03:27:40,430
I see, I see, I see.

4624
03:27:41,650 --> 03:27:42,230
What was that?

4625
03:27:42,310 --> 03:27:43,110
Oh, charge it up, right?

4626
03:27:43,110 --> 03:27:43,130
What?

4627
03:27:43,870 --> 03:27:44,310
Oh!

4628
03:27:44,430 --> 03:27:44,530
Oh!

4629
03:27:57,290 --> 03:27:58,530
Stop charging Tomboy.

4630
03:27:58,630 --> 03:27:59,310
Just charge the gun.

4631
03:27:59,530 --> 03:27:59,890
What?

4632
03:28:00,010 --> 03:28:01,250
How am I supposed to know that?

4633
03:28:02,710 --> 03:28:03,150
Sorry.

4634
03:28:04,110 --> 03:28:05,630
I meant people just say to charge.

4635
03:28:05,830 --> 03:28:07,770
I thought charge the gun and Tomboy.

4636
03:28:08,010 --> 03:28:09,550
I thought you meant charge Tomboy.

4637
03:28:14,530 --> 03:28:15,270
Okay.

4638
03:28:15,270 --> 03:28:15,950
I'm charging.

4639
03:28:19,830 --> 03:28:20,570
I'm charging.

4640
03:28:20,570 --> 03:28:20,950
I'm charging.

4641
03:28:25,020 --> 03:28:25,760
I'm charging.

4642
03:28:25,760 --> 03:28:26,380
Is that it?

4643
03:28:29,760 --> 03:28:30,780
Hold the gun.

4644
03:28:30,880 --> 03:28:31,240
I am.

4645
03:28:35,250 --> 03:28:36,730
With Tomboy active.

4646
03:28:36,930 --> 03:28:37,950
Thank you.

4647
03:28:40,830 --> 03:28:41,310
Oh!

4648
03:28:58,270 --> 03:29:01,230
What was it like when I just...

4649
03:29:16,460 --> 03:29:17,420
Wowie powie.

4650
03:29:19,220 --> 03:29:19,700
Cool.

4651
03:29:20,040 --> 03:29:20,920
I think we're good.

4652
03:29:21,040 --> 03:29:21,880
Well, actually, hold on.

4653
03:29:22,120 --> 03:29:22,760
I mean...

4654
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:26,740
Is there anything special?

4655
03:29:27,300 --> 03:29:27,780
Well...

4656
03:29:27,780 --> 03:29:29,420
I guess it was just...

4657
03:29:33,040 --> 03:29:34,080
Just this, right?

4658
03:29:38,340 --> 03:29:39,180
Big dam...

4659
03:29:39,180 --> 03:29:39,920
Oh, air too.

4660
03:29:42,440 --> 03:29:43,340
Oh, air too.

4661
03:29:51,860 --> 03:29:52,700
Wait, uh...

4662
03:29:52,700 --> 03:29:53,420
Wait.

4663
03:29:53,820 --> 03:29:54,700
Oh, hold on.

4664
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:55,920
Let me get him up in the air.

4665
03:29:59,420 --> 03:30:00,240
There we go.

4666
03:30:00,540 --> 03:30:01,140
Ah ha ha.

4667
03:30:02,880 --> 03:30:03,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4668
03:30:05,220 --> 03:30:06,840
You can snatch.

4669
03:30:07,060 --> 03:30:07,280
Oh, true.

4670
03:30:09,060 --> 03:30:09,540
Wait.

4671
03:30:12,460 --> 03:30:13,020
Brah!

4672
03:30:14,320 --> 03:30:14,880
Samadram.

4673
03:30:15,420 --> 03:30:15,700
Alright.

4674
03:30:16,120 --> 03:30:17,040
Let's keep going.

4675
03:30:17,700 --> 03:30:20,080
I'm gonna switch my...

4676
03:30:20,600 --> 03:30:21,980
My...

4677
03:30:24,520 --> 03:30:25,960
Build a little...

4678
03:30:26,420 --> 03:30:27,820
Or magazine.

4679
03:30:28,900 --> 03:30:29,740
Let's see.

4680
03:30:31,380 --> 03:30:31,940
Wait.

4681
03:30:31,940 --> 03:30:33,420
Let's switch with...

4682
03:30:33,940 --> 03:30:34,680
Tomboy.

4683
03:30:34,980 --> 03:30:36,160
And then after...

4684
03:30:36,160 --> 03:30:36,950
We'll have...

4685
03:30:38,300 --> 03:30:39,120
Busterron.

4686
03:30:41,570 --> 03:30:41,980
What?

4687
03:30:42,120 --> 03:30:43,540
What did I get two of those?

4688
03:30:44,790 --> 03:30:45,200
Okay.

4689
03:30:47,000 --> 03:30:48,120
Okie dokie.

4690
03:30:48,780 --> 03:30:49,380
Artichokey.

4691
03:30:50,610 --> 03:30:51,420
I think we're good.

4692
03:30:54,670 --> 03:30:55,080
Woohoo!

4693
03:30:55,500 --> 03:30:56,800
Mission six, baby.

4694
03:30:57,340 --> 03:30:58,320
Steel impact.

4695
03:30:58,320 --> 03:30:58,640
I asked.

4696
03:30:58,740 --> 03:30:59,040
Look at...

4697
03:30:59,040 --> 03:30:59,800
Why is he...

4698
03:30:59,800 --> 03:31:02,040
Why is he looking at her like that?

4699
03:31:02,160 --> 03:31:04,820
Why haven't they given Lady any clothes?

4700
03:31:06,880 --> 03:31:08,720
Nico, do you not have a wardrobe?

4701
03:31:09,240 --> 03:31:12,280
Nico, do you just wear the same outfit every single day?

4702
03:31:12,600 --> 03:31:13,540
All the time?

4703
03:31:15,120 --> 03:31:15,760
Why?

4704
03:31:16,200 --> 03:31:16,740
Why?

4705
03:31:17,360 --> 03:31:19,120
Nobody brought spares.

4706
03:31:19,500 --> 03:31:22,000
Does nobody have anything to give her to wear?

4707
03:31:26,040 --> 03:31:27,360
They're on a budget.

4708
03:31:27,780 --> 03:31:28,000
Clearly.

4709
03:31:28,200 --> 03:31:28,300
Oh!

4710
03:31:28,640 --> 03:31:29,360
Hi, lady.

4711
03:31:30,600 --> 03:31:31,720
Hi, lady.

4712
03:31:32,300 --> 03:31:33,900
Looks like she's having a nice dream.

4713
03:31:34,420 --> 03:31:35,520
She looks so peaceful.

4714
03:31:36,480 --> 03:31:36,800
Hold on.

4715
03:31:36,820 --> 03:31:38,660
I'm gonna eat some...

4716
03:31:39,240 --> 03:31:41,180
I'm gonna eat a quick snack real quick.

4717
03:31:42,360 --> 03:31:44,640
Quick snack real quick.

4718
03:31:46,760 --> 03:31:48,120
I got some almonds.

4719
03:31:48,960 --> 03:31:50,240
Hopefully they're not poisoned.

4720
03:31:50,240 --> 03:31:51,490
But I'm already dead, so...

4721
03:32:03,220 --> 03:32:05,140
Buddy, what you munching on?

4722
03:32:06,300 --> 03:32:07,080
Almonds, buddy.

4723
03:32:07,320 --> 03:32:07,940
Almonds, buddy.

4724
03:32:12,200 --> 03:32:13,200
Look in the membership!

4725
03:32:13,840 --> 03:32:14,380
What are you?

4726
03:32:14,860 --> 03:32:16,160
Oh, put clothes on her?

4727
03:32:21,510 --> 03:32:22,590
What are you talking about?

4728
03:32:22,690 --> 03:32:23,910
I'm a respectful lady.

4729
03:32:24,250 --> 03:32:25,570
I respect women.

4730
03:32:28,450 --> 03:32:29,770
Of course I would.

4731
03:32:34,420 --> 03:32:35,840
Of course I would.

4732
03:32:41,140 --> 03:32:42,760
Sorry if you can hear me munching.

4733
03:32:52,820 --> 03:32:55,460
Now, what kind of outfit would I put on her?

4734
03:33:00,040 --> 03:33:01,320
Can you give us a good crunch?

4735
03:33:02,480 --> 03:33:03,660
Oh, that wasn't good at all.

4736
03:33:03,700 --> 03:33:03,880
Hold on.

4737
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:05,720
Let me get a new one.

4738
03:33:11,870 --> 03:33:12,290
Okay.

4739
03:33:12,490 --> 03:33:13,810
I have a brand new almond.

4740
03:33:14,450 --> 03:33:15,470
If you don't like...

4741
03:33:16,430 --> 03:33:17,690
Munching ASMR.

4742
03:33:18,070 --> 03:33:18,750
Don't listen.

4743
03:33:19,590 --> 03:33:20,230
For like one second.

4744
03:33:23,070 --> 03:33:24,130
Here we go.

4745
03:33:24,430 --> 03:33:25,050
One almond.

4746
03:33:27,610 --> 03:33:28,310
Whoa!

4747
03:33:29,750 --> 03:33:30,790
That was a crunch.

4748
03:33:32,170 --> 03:33:32,490
Alright.

4749
03:33:33,070 --> 03:33:33,670
Mission start.

4750
03:33:39,210 --> 03:33:40,090
Thank you.

4751
03:33:40,250 --> 03:33:40,550
Thank you.

4752
03:33:41,530 --> 03:33:42,010
You're welcome.

4753
03:33:42,650 --> 03:33:44,010
Got a pretty smokin' body though.

4754
03:33:44,530 --> 03:33:45,290
Yeah, she do.

4755
03:33:46,450 --> 03:33:47,270
Not that...

4756
03:33:47,270 --> 03:33:48,230
I was...

4757
03:33:48,230 --> 03:33:49,390
barely even noticed.

4758
03:33:50,150 --> 03:33:50,850
You know...

4759
03:33:50,850 --> 03:33:51,970
You should go do your thing.

4760
03:33:52,250 --> 03:33:53,270
I got this.

4761
03:33:53,970 --> 03:33:54,450
Yeah.

4762
03:33:57,130 --> 03:33:59,070
Nero hates women loving women.

4763
03:34:00,190 --> 03:34:00,630
I know.

4764
03:34:00,650 --> 03:34:01,770
She's a girl's girl.

4765
03:34:03,170 --> 03:34:04,590
He's too big to leave alone.

4766
03:34:05,070 --> 03:34:05,830
We'll take care of it.

4767
03:34:06,190 --> 03:34:06,770
Oh wait, what?

4768
03:34:06,910 --> 03:34:07,270
Stay alert.

4769
03:34:07,550 --> 03:34:07,630
Yeah.

4770
03:34:09,270 --> 03:34:10,670
Wait, we're taking care of that?

4771
03:34:19,540 --> 03:34:21,320
Not even B would take care of that.

4772
03:34:23,040 --> 03:34:24,320
KDA only.

4773
03:34:24,660 --> 03:34:24,980
Yeah.

4774
03:34:25,500 --> 03:34:26,420
He's so like...

4775
03:34:27,720 --> 03:34:28,960
Kill Gomesh!

4776
03:34:30,080 --> 03:34:31,360
He's so...

4777
03:34:32,360 --> 03:34:33,000
Like...

4778
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:34,500
How do you say?

4779
03:34:34,780 --> 03:34:35,520
Oh, I see.

4780
03:34:35,580 --> 03:34:35,760
Okay.

4781
03:34:36,300 --> 03:34:36,940
Understandable.

4782
03:34:38,380 --> 03:34:38,740
S...

4783
03:34:38,740 --> 03:34:39,860
Not straight list.

4784
03:34:40,160 --> 03:34:41,320
He's so like...

4785
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:45,060
So serious.

4786
03:34:45,080 --> 03:34:45,840
I guess.

4787
03:34:47,140 --> 03:34:47,860
You know?

4788
03:34:48,040 --> 03:34:49,480
He's just such a serious guy.

4789
03:34:49,680 --> 03:34:51,040
He doesn't take any sort of jokes.

4790
03:34:52,280 --> 03:34:52,760
Um...

4791
03:34:54,720 --> 03:34:55,200
Okay.

4792
03:34:57,280 --> 03:34:57,760
Um...

4793
03:34:57,760 --> 03:34:58,600
How do I get up there?

4794
03:35:00,240 --> 03:35:01,340
Anything I can jump?

4795
03:35:04,720 --> 03:35:06,000
Oh wait, I can get his legs.

4796
03:35:11,040 --> 03:35:12,120
Wait, jump, jump, jump.

4797
03:35:12,860 --> 03:35:13,220
Oh!

4798
03:35:13,500 --> 03:35:13,740
Ah!

4799
03:35:14,200 --> 03:35:15,200
I see, I see.

4800
03:35:15,540 --> 03:35:16,000
Wait.

4801
03:35:17,160 --> 03:35:17,640
Oh.

4802
03:35:17,880 --> 03:35:18,400
I got him.

4803
03:35:18,660 --> 03:35:20,700
Get up on the Hydra's back!

4804
03:35:21,440 --> 03:35:21,920
Wait.

4805
03:35:30,290 --> 03:35:32,550
Wait, why am I doing that when I just have...

4806
03:35:33,130 --> 03:35:33,610
Tomboy?

4807
03:35:34,950 --> 03:35:36,970
Why am I doing that when I got Tomboy?

4808
03:35:38,490 --> 03:35:38,970
Woo!

4809
03:35:39,670 --> 03:35:40,510
Holy moly.

4810
03:35:44,590 --> 03:35:45,590
Oh my god.

4811
03:35:57,020 --> 03:35:57,660
Oh my god.

4812
03:35:59,320 --> 03:35:59,640
Rude!

4813
03:35:59,800 --> 03:35:59,900
Oh!

4814
03:36:00,220 --> 03:36:00,740
Oh my gosh.

4815
03:36:00,880 --> 03:36:01,180
Oh my gosh.

4816
03:36:01,240 --> 03:36:01,620
I can't see.

4817
03:36:03,360 --> 03:36:04,600
Where do you think you're going?

4818
03:36:04,900 --> 03:36:05,160
Yeah!

4819
03:36:05,340 --> 03:36:06,280
Where do you think you're going?

4820
03:36:11,770 --> 03:36:12,090
Uh...

4821
03:36:12,090 --> 03:36:13,570
I wish I had...

4822
03:36:13,570 --> 03:36:14,590
Wait, how do I get over there?

4823
03:36:14,690 --> 03:36:15,550
Okay, we're just gonna...

4824
03:36:15,550 --> 03:36:15,650
Oh!

4825
03:36:15,890 --> 03:36:16,110
Oh!

4826
03:36:16,250 --> 03:36:16,350
Oh!

4827
03:36:16,350 --> 03:36:16,570
Nice.

4828
03:36:16,690 --> 03:36:16,810
Nice.

4829
03:36:18,750 --> 03:36:19,070
Nice.

4830
03:36:19,070 --> 03:36:21,410
Not that I need it right now, but...

4831
03:36:22,030 --> 03:36:22,350
Uh...

4832
03:36:22,350 --> 03:36:22,850
Oh, nice.

4833
03:36:25,970 --> 03:36:26,290
Um...

4834
03:36:30,450 --> 03:36:30,770
Uh...

4835
03:36:33,150 --> 03:36:33,890
Oh my god.

4836
03:36:34,030 --> 03:36:34,430
Oh my god.

4837
03:36:34,570 --> 03:36:34,990
Oh my god.

4838
03:36:35,150 --> 03:36:35,630
Oh my god.

4839
03:36:39,870 --> 03:36:40,410
Let me...

4840
03:36:40,410 --> 03:36:41,170
Let me...

4841
03:36:41,170 --> 03:36:41,650
Let me grab you.

4842
03:36:43,270 --> 03:36:43,810
Whoop!

4843
03:36:43,990 --> 03:36:44,210
Whoop!

4844
03:36:44,310 --> 03:36:44,410
Whoop!

4845
03:36:44,570 --> 03:36:44,990
Whoop!

4846
03:37:07,270 --> 03:37:08,650
There goes Tomboy.

4847
03:37:09,150 --> 03:37:09,690
Nooo!

4848
03:37:10,250 --> 03:37:11,050
Oh my god.

4849
03:37:16,300 --> 03:37:17,200
So sad.

4850
03:37:17,440 --> 03:37:18,240
My Tomboy!

4851
03:37:18,960 --> 03:37:19,640
Come on.

4852
03:37:19,700 --> 03:37:20,980
I need you to jump, buddy.

4853
03:37:20,980 --> 03:37:21,760
Oh!

4854
03:37:22,000 --> 03:37:22,260
Oh!

4855
03:37:22,500 --> 03:37:23,360
Actually, that works.

4856
03:37:23,820 --> 03:37:24,320
For us.

4857
03:37:33,190 --> 03:37:36,010
Maybe Buster Arm is not great for this fight.

4858
03:37:38,370 --> 03:37:39,330
Oh, dang it!

4859
03:37:42,830 --> 03:37:44,030
Buster the red spot?

4860
03:37:44,350 --> 03:37:44,950
Will it work?

4861
03:38:06,490 --> 03:38:08,070
You have to wait for the big stun.

4862
03:38:08,310 --> 03:38:08,550
Okay.

4863
03:38:08,550 --> 03:38:10,330
What are you doing down there?

4864
03:38:10,530 --> 03:38:11,830
Yeah, what are you doing down there?

4865
03:38:12,130 --> 03:38:12,410
Ha!

4866
03:38:12,950 --> 03:38:15,330
You didn't think you did that all by yourself, did ya?

4867
03:38:17,170 --> 03:38:18,130
You know...

4868
03:38:18,130 --> 03:38:20,190
I bet you taste like chicken.

4869
03:38:20,590 --> 03:38:21,990
Oh, you want great...

4870
03:38:21,990 --> 03:38:22,650
What should I...

4871
03:38:22,650 --> 03:38:23,690
What do you mean Buster now?

4872
03:38:23,830 --> 03:38:24,350
Should I...

4873
03:38:25,730 --> 03:38:27,550
Like Hold Buster or...

4874
03:38:29,610 --> 03:38:30,090
Or...

4875
03:38:30,090 --> 03:38:31,030
Just Small Buster?

4876
03:38:31,690 --> 03:38:32,370
Hold Buster?

4877
03:38:34,930 --> 03:38:35,410
Well...

4878
03:38:35,410 --> 03:38:37,750
Guess it's just you and me, cockroach.

4879
03:38:37,750 --> 03:38:38,250
Just use.

4880
03:38:38,470 --> 03:38:38,570
Okay.

4881
03:38:40,270 --> 03:38:40,630
Hold.

4882
03:38:54,050 --> 03:38:54,890
Good job, guys.

4883
03:38:54,990 --> 03:38:55,310
Thank you.

4884
03:38:55,730 --> 03:38:56,450
Thank you, thank you.

4885
03:38:58,410 --> 03:38:58,770
Um...

4886
03:38:58,770 --> 03:38:59,590
You getting back up now?

4887
03:38:59,690 --> 03:39:00,110
Oh, there it is.

4888
03:39:00,750 --> 03:39:01,470
Oh, kinda.

4889
03:39:01,690 --> 03:39:02,230
But it's gone.

4890
03:39:02,550 --> 03:39:03,130
There it was.

4891
03:39:03,650 --> 03:39:03,950
There it was.

4892
03:39:03,950 --> 03:39:06,290
Oh, I lost it.

4893
03:39:13,660 --> 03:39:14,040
Please!

4894
03:39:16,400 --> 03:39:17,140
Oh, there we go.

4895
03:39:17,560 --> 03:39:18,300
Please, grab it.

4896
03:39:18,520 --> 03:39:18,940
Nope, nope.

4897
03:39:19,060 --> 03:39:19,480
Grab that part.

4898
03:39:19,720 --> 03:39:20,680
There we go.

4899
03:39:21,780 --> 03:39:22,160
Alright.

4900
03:39:40,570 --> 03:39:41,330
I'm just...

4901
03:39:41,330 --> 03:39:42,410
Okay, it's gone now.

4902
03:39:42,590 --> 03:39:42,890
Oh, eh.

4903
03:39:43,130 --> 03:39:43,610
No, no, no.

4904
03:39:44,670 --> 03:39:44,950
Yeah.

4905
03:39:45,310 --> 03:39:45,590
Yeah.

4906
03:39:45,870 --> 03:39:46,230
Ow.

4907
03:39:46,370 --> 03:39:47,070
Oh, so slippery.

4908
03:39:47,290 --> 03:39:47,430
Oh.

4909
03:39:47,870 --> 03:39:48,190
Okay, okay.

4910
03:39:50,270 --> 03:39:51,670
I got another Buster on.

4911
03:39:52,690 --> 03:39:53,050
Yippee.

4912
03:39:59,760 --> 03:40:00,120
Wait.

4913
03:40:00,820 --> 03:40:01,180
Wait.

4914
03:40:03,100 --> 03:40:03,460
And...

4915
03:40:04,160 --> 03:40:04,940
Nope, not yet.

4916
03:40:05,120 --> 03:40:05,640
Okay, just kidding.

4917
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:06,220
Thank you.

4918
03:40:06,360 --> 03:40:06,460
Ah.

4919
03:40:06,740 --> 03:40:07,460
I thought I was down.

4920
03:40:07,780 --> 03:40:07,960
No.

4921
03:40:20,260 --> 03:40:21,240
There's like little drones.

4922
03:40:21,360 --> 03:40:22,140
What are you doing up here?

4923
03:40:22,580 --> 03:40:23,020
Go away.

4924
03:40:29,660 --> 03:40:30,220
Oh, my God.

4925
03:40:30,380 --> 03:40:30,740
Oh, my God.

4926
03:40:30,920 --> 03:40:31,200
Oh, my God.

4927
03:40:31,380 --> 03:40:39,000
Oh, my

4928
03:40:42,770 --> 03:40:43,010
God.

4929
03:40:43,010 --> 03:40:43,550
That's quite annoying.

4930
03:40:43,890 --> 03:40:44,410
There we go.

4931
03:40:44,590 --> 03:40:45,730
Well, at least I got that.

4932
03:40:45,910 --> 03:40:46,790
That's what I was coming for.

4933
03:40:56,070 --> 03:40:57,670
This thing is so cute though.

4934
03:40:57,870 --> 03:40:59,310
I kind of really like him.

4935
03:41:02,390 --> 03:41:02,830
No.

4936
03:41:03,510 --> 03:41:04,610
Not this thing again.

4937
03:41:04,690 --> 03:41:04,970
Please.

4938
03:41:05,890 --> 03:41:06,630
Oh, please.

4939
03:41:06,950 --> 03:41:07,110
No.

4940
03:41:07,370 --> 03:41:07,810
No, not you.

4941
03:41:08,110 --> 03:41:08,210
No.

4942
03:41:09,430 --> 03:41:09,870
Ouch.

4943
03:41:10,970 --> 03:41:11,410
Please.

4944
03:41:11,650 --> 03:41:11,890
Please.

4945
03:41:12,270 --> 03:41:12,370
Please.

4946
03:41:12,630 --> 03:41:12,850
Yes.

4947
03:41:13,110 --> 03:41:13,410
There we go.

4948
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:26,410
I tried to dodge it.

4949
03:41:26,550 --> 03:41:27,210
It's okay.

4950
03:41:28,730 --> 03:41:29,330
Oh.

4951
03:41:29,390 --> 03:41:32,150
Oh, my God.

4952
03:41:32,650 --> 03:41:33,410
That's okay.

4953
03:41:39,850 --> 03:41:40,750
Is he down now?

4954
03:41:47,210 --> 03:41:47,630
It's different.

4955
03:41:47,830 --> 03:41:49,230
The minimum amount of damage.

4956
03:41:52,610 --> 03:41:53,390
What is it?

4957
03:41:54,170 --> 03:41:54,770
No.

4958
03:41:54,910 --> 03:41:55,310
No.

4959
03:42:01,150 --> 03:42:01,750
Please.

4960
03:42:03,310 --> 03:42:03,830
Please!

4961
03:42:03,830 --> 03:42:06,810
No, no!

4962
03:42:07,070 --> 03:42:07,530
Please!

4963
03:42:08,530 --> 03:42:09,050
Circle!

4964
03:42:09,290 --> 03:42:09,750
No, no, no!

4965
03:42:10,090 --> 03:42:10,190
No!

4966
03:42:10,330 --> 03:42:10,730
There we go.

4967
03:42:11,270 --> 03:42:11,690
Really?

4968
03:42:11,950 --> 03:42:12,270
Why?

4969
03:42:12,530 --> 03:42:12,870
Please!

4970
03:42:14,190 --> 03:42:17,050
Oh my god.

4971
03:42:17,510 --> 03:42:18,350
This stinking thing.

4972
03:42:18,630 --> 03:42:19,670
Oh, at least there's health here.

4973
03:42:20,150 --> 03:42:20,570
That's good.

4974
03:42:21,630 --> 03:42:23,050
Oh, and some Rorbs.

4975
03:42:23,110 --> 03:42:23,650
I'll take that.

4976
03:42:25,470 --> 03:42:25,990
Please!

4977
03:42:26,870 --> 03:42:27,630
Get close!

4978
03:42:34,770 --> 03:42:39,110
The saddest way.

4979
03:42:47,080 --> 03:42:48,980
Oh, that's so silly.

4980
03:42:51,560 --> 03:42:52,480
Ugh.

4981
03:42:54,860 --> 03:42:57,300
Everything is, everything is vegetable.

4982
03:42:57,300 --> 03:42:57,520
What?

4983
03:42:59,560 --> 03:43:00,660
Yo, ladies away.

4984
03:43:00,860 --> 03:43:01,880
Got any questions for her?

4985
03:43:01,920 --> 03:43:02,780
Better make it fast.

4986
03:43:03,060 --> 03:43:03,580
Better make it fast.

4987
03:43:04,740 --> 03:43:05,720
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.

4988
03:43:05,920 --> 03:43:06,560
We could use that.

4989
03:43:06,620 --> 03:43:07,040
Pick it up.

4990
03:43:07,700 --> 03:43:08,100
Oh.

4991
03:43:08,880 --> 03:43:09,360
New arm?

4992
03:43:09,740 --> 03:43:09,740
Oh.

4993
03:43:11,760 --> 03:43:12,360
This one?

4994
03:43:12,660 --> 03:43:13,500
Next to it.

4995
03:43:14,740 --> 03:43:15,600
Come on, Nico.

4996
03:43:15,760 --> 03:43:16,220
This one?

4997
03:43:17,040 --> 03:43:17,440
Sure.

4998
03:43:17,960 --> 03:43:18,220
Sure.

4999
03:43:20,140 --> 03:43:21,600
What were you, what do you mean sure?

5000
03:43:21,740 --> 03:43:23,400
Which one were you referring to?

5001
03:43:26,500 --> 03:43:27,960
Why is there canned food?

5002
03:43:28,360 --> 03:43:28,640
Why?

5003
03:43:28,780 --> 03:43:30,600
I think that's pretty useful too, though, no?

5004
03:43:33,420 --> 03:43:33,860
Yippee!

5005
03:43:33,860 --> 03:43:36,040
Guys, I gotta find my eye drops real quick.

5006
03:43:38,040 --> 03:43:39,140
I'm too focused.

5007
03:43:39,640 --> 03:43:41,040
My ectoplasm's all dried up.

5008
03:43:42,820 --> 03:43:45,780
Actually, I think they might be in another room.

5009
03:43:46,200 --> 03:43:48,200
Your eye drops are in another castle.

5010
03:43:48,440 --> 03:43:49,280
Can I go get them real quick?

5011
03:43:52,100 --> 03:43:53,840
8 57 AM.

5012
03:43:54,760 --> 03:43:57,000
Let's watch this and then we'll, I'll go grab them.

5013
03:44:00,590 --> 03:44:01,190
Nico.

5014
03:44:03,030 --> 03:44:04,910
Good morning, lady.

5015
03:44:05,790 --> 03:44:07,530
So what happened to them and Trish?

5016
03:44:08,330 --> 03:44:09,470
They end up like you?

5017
03:44:10,110 --> 03:44:10,710
What?

5018
03:44:11,970 --> 03:44:13,410
I didn't think about that.

5019
03:44:13,570 --> 03:44:16,570
Trish, she... she was captured.

5020
03:44:16,890 --> 03:44:17,950
I remember that.

5021
03:44:17,950 --> 03:44:19,450
I'm not gonna have to fight Dante.

5022
03:44:20,350 --> 03:44:22,290
I don't know what happened to Dante.

5023
03:44:24,250 --> 03:44:24,970
Damn it.

5024
03:44:27,390 --> 03:44:29,530
You can't travel through here in a car.

5025
03:44:30,550 --> 03:44:31,410
Yeah, we know.

5026
03:44:31,630 --> 03:44:32,650
We're just waiting on you.

5027
03:44:33,290 --> 03:44:34,710
There's only one way up that tree.

5028
03:44:34,890 --> 03:44:36,390
But is it gonna be evil possessed Dante?

5029
03:44:43,290 --> 03:44:45,370
I'm glad to see you look so well.

5030
03:44:46,430 --> 03:44:47,810
You too, I guess.

5031
03:44:48,990 --> 03:44:50,230
I found these.

5032
03:44:50,590 --> 03:44:53,230
If they're of any use to you, they're yours.

5033
03:44:53,650 --> 03:44:54,170
Wow.

5034
03:44:54,610 --> 03:44:56,850
I can make something truly awesome out of these.

5035
03:44:57,170 --> 03:44:57,850
Hell yeah.

5036
03:44:57,850 --> 03:44:57,950
Hell yeah.

5037
03:44:58,470 --> 03:44:59,590
How old is Lady?

5038
03:44:59,910 --> 03:45:00,190
Is she?

5039
03:45:00,350 --> 03:45:00,510
Shocker.

5040
03:45:01,210 --> 03:45:02,170
Can we trust him?

5041
03:45:03,930 --> 03:45:05,450
Your guest is as good as mine.

5042
03:45:06,830 --> 03:45:07,770
He might be useful.

5043
03:45:07,770 --> 03:45:09,910
I like how nobody knows who the hell V is.

5044
03:45:10,830 --> 03:45:10,850
Enough talking.

5045
03:45:10,850 --> 03:45:11,470
Get some rest.

5046
03:45:11,650 --> 03:45:12,090
You need it.

5047
03:45:14,050 --> 03:45:14,450
Forties?

5048
03:45:14,970 --> 03:45:16,210
In her forties?

5049
03:45:16,390 --> 03:45:17,230
She looks amazing.

5050
03:45:19,170 --> 03:45:19,970
Late thirties.

5051
03:45:27,370 --> 03:45:28,430
He's just some random...

5052
03:45:28,430 --> 03:45:29,870
Everyone's like, can we trust this guy?

5053
03:45:30,470 --> 03:45:31,110
I don't know.

5054
03:45:32,170 --> 03:45:32,690
Yo!

5055
03:45:32,950 --> 03:45:33,950
Lady, wake up!

5056
03:45:35,730 --> 03:45:37,090
It's time to get to work.

5057
03:45:37,810 --> 03:45:40,030
I was just told to get some rest.

5058
03:45:40,230 --> 03:45:40,570
Aw.

5059
03:45:40,870 --> 03:45:42,410
You were just told to get some rest?

5060
03:45:42,770 --> 03:45:44,010
Well, we need to make a path.

5061
03:45:44,270 --> 03:45:45,270
So start digging.

5062
03:45:46,910 --> 03:45:47,750
Come on!

5063
03:45:47,830 --> 03:45:49,570
She doesn't even have clothes on!

5064
03:45:50,130 --> 03:45:52,230
Got something to wear that's good for digging?

5065
03:45:52,530 --> 03:45:53,010
Whoa!

5066
03:46:01,000 --> 03:46:01,520
What?

5067
03:46:02,040 --> 03:46:02,820
I get to pick?

5068
03:46:03,160 --> 03:46:03,980
No way.

5069
03:46:04,380 --> 03:46:05,020
Okay, hold on.

5070
03:46:05,020 --> 03:46:05,580
Let me go.

5071
03:46:05,580 --> 03:46:06,440
Let me go grab.

5072
03:46:06,620 --> 03:46:07,840
Let me go grab my address real quick.

5073
03:46:08,740 --> 03:46:09,680
I know where they are.

5074
03:46:10,680 --> 03:46:11,160
Give me a second.

5075
03:46:11,720 --> 03:46:12,460
Give me a second.

5076
03:46:12,580 --> 03:46:13,020
Give me a second.

5077
03:46:14,820 --> 03:46:15,620
Give me a second.

5078
03:46:15,620 --> 03:46:15,920
Give me a second.

5079
03:46:17,420 --> 03:46:18,540
Whoever I stop on.

5080
03:46:21,080 --> 03:46:21,440
Nero!

5081
03:46:22,060 --> 03:46:22,460
Okay, bear, babe.

5082
03:48:40,990 --> 03:48:41,710
Hold on, guys.

5083
03:48:41,830 --> 03:48:43,890
I'm also gonna go grab drink.

5084
03:48:44,310 --> 03:48:44,910
I'll be right back.

5085
03:48:44,910 --> 03:48:47,150
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

5086
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:36,740
What was that face?

5087
03:50:39,120 --> 03:50:40,780
I was like...

5088
03:50:40,780 --> 03:50:41,480
I can't...

5089
03:50:41,480 --> 03:50:43,000
I don't even think I can recreate it.

5090
03:50:43,620 --> 03:50:46,040
I was like...

5091
03:50:53,410 --> 03:50:54,670
Sorry, I've made some tea.

5092
03:50:57,170 --> 03:50:59,650
I made myself some tea.

5093
03:51:01,290 --> 03:51:03,590
You can get a mod to remove the lens flare.

5094
03:51:05,170 --> 03:51:07,310
I'm so cute when she's making AFK faces.

5095
03:51:08,210 --> 03:51:08,410
Yeah!

5096
03:51:11,760 --> 03:51:13,100
A nice cuppa.

5097
03:51:13,500 --> 03:51:14,620
Yeah, a nice cuppa.

5098
03:51:15,060 --> 03:51:16,760
I guess I'll keep playing at...

5099
03:51:16,760 --> 03:51:17,220
I don't know.

5100
03:51:17,760 --> 03:51:18,760
I don't know, actually.

5101
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:22,940
I would feel really...

5102
03:51:23,940 --> 03:51:24,260
So...

5103
03:51:24,840 --> 03:51:26,620
I don't wanna, like, keep playing.

5104
03:51:26,960 --> 03:51:27,600
Okay, hold on.

5105
03:51:28,060 --> 03:51:29,240
No, I do wanna keep playing.

5106
03:51:29,760 --> 03:51:30,080
I...

5107
03:51:30,620 --> 03:51:30,940
I...

5108
03:51:31,420 --> 03:51:31,740
Worry...

5109
03:51:32,960 --> 03:51:33,600
If I...

5110
03:51:34,120 --> 03:51:36,420
Play as, like, V a lot...

5111
03:51:37,380 --> 03:51:39,700
And then they're like, Oh, by the way, you have to switch back to Nero.

5112
03:51:39,820 --> 03:51:40,560
And I'm like, Oh, shoot.

5113
03:51:40,560 --> 03:51:42,640
I don't remember how to play Nero anymore.

5114
03:51:43,140 --> 03:51:43,720
You know?

5115
03:51:43,720 --> 03:51:44,100
Oh...

5116
03:51:47,520 --> 03:51:48,080
Hmm...

5117
03:51:54,380 --> 03:51:54,940
Hmm...

5118
03:51:54,940 --> 03:51:56,160
I'm gonna play as Nero.

5119
03:51:57,880 --> 03:51:59,440
Are the cutscenes different, though?

5120
03:51:59,520 --> 03:52:00,600
Depending on who you play as?

5121
03:52:02,720 --> 03:52:03,720
Are they different?

5122
03:52:07,160 --> 03:52:07,720
Okay.

5123
03:52:08,800 --> 03:52:10,060
I got a new arm for ya.

5124
03:52:10,060 --> 03:52:10,060
No?

5125
03:52:10,060 --> 03:52:10,200
Oh, okay.

5126
03:52:10,960 --> 03:52:11,880
Got a new arm...

5127
03:52:11,880 --> 03:52:12,500
Ride!

5128
03:52:14,380 --> 03:52:15,340
Aw, yeah.

5129
03:52:15,900 --> 03:52:16,380
Rad!

5130
03:52:16,420 --> 03:52:16,860
Time!

5131
03:52:19,100 --> 03:52:20,300
It is time!

5132
03:52:21,300 --> 03:52:21,780
Wait.

5133
03:52:22,340 --> 03:52:23,160
Oh my gosh.

5134
03:52:23,220 --> 03:52:24,240
We have so many now.

5135
03:52:27,140 --> 03:52:28,280
It's so expensive!

5136
03:52:28,740 --> 03:52:34,200
A devil breaker that controls time projects a special field that slows all objects within its range.

5137
03:52:34,420 --> 03:52:34,540
Whoa.

5138
03:52:34,900 --> 03:52:35,580
Does that include meat?

5139
03:52:36,840 --> 03:52:39,660
I'm sure there was an update that removed the lens flare without a mod.

5140
03:52:39,800 --> 03:52:40,460
No way!

5141
03:52:40,460 --> 03:52:40,480
Okay.

5142
03:52:41,980 --> 03:52:42,540
Rawhide.

5143
03:52:42,680 --> 03:52:44,120
Boast the widest attack range.

5144
03:52:45,200 --> 03:52:50,120
Use the metal whip for a long distance strike or to reel in certain heavy enemies.

5145
03:52:51,420 --> 03:52:52,360
Oh, I see.

5146
03:52:57,220 --> 03:52:59,380
Now I just need to make more space.

5147
03:53:02,840 --> 03:53:04,980
Wait, but we're so close to...

5148
03:53:05,760 --> 03:53:06,620
What was it?

5149
03:53:06,660 --> 03:53:07,700
Wire Snatch 3.

5150
03:53:15,940 --> 03:53:17,480
But I want to try them both.

5151
03:53:17,840 --> 03:53:18,180
Obviously.

5152
03:53:18,540 --> 03:53:19,100
So let me...

5153
03:53:20,180 --> 03:53:21,260
Uh, edit.

5154
03:53:24,420 --> 03:53:24,940
Yeah.

5155
03:53:26,620 --> 03:53:27,140
Yeah.

5156
03:53:33,650 --> 03:53:34,170
Oh!

5157
03:53:34,390 --> 03:53:35,130
I'm so stupid!

5158
03:53:35,350 --> 03:53:35,510
No!

5159
03:53:35,770 --> 03:53:35,870
Oh!

5160
03:53:35,870 --> 03:53:36,650
Go back!

5161
03:53:36,790 --> 03:53:36,870
Okay.

5162
03:53:36,970 --> 03:53:37,170
Phew!

5163
03:53:41,630 --> 03:53:41,950
Um...

5164
03:53:41,950 --> 03:53:42,590
Let's try it.

5165
03:53:46,190 --> 03:53:46,830
Okay.

5166
03:53:54,770 --> 03:53:56,810
How much further is it?

5167
03:53:57,350 --> 03:53:58,210
Of a...

5168
03:53:58,210 --> 03:53:58,730
Snatch?

5169
03:54:00,050 --> 03:54:01,230
Not that far.

5170
03:54:02,350 --> 03:54:03,310
That was pretty far though.

5171
03:54:07,210 --> 03:54:07,850
Wait.

5172
03:54:08,230 --> 03:54:10,110
I didn't see what its normal attack is.

5173
03:54:10,110 --> 03:54:11,070
Woah!

5174
03:54:19,810 --> 03:54:20,210
Woah!

5175
03:54:20,710 --> 03:54:20,870
Woah!

5176
03:54:21,390 --> 03:54:21,670
Woah!

5177
03:54:24,310 --> 03:54:24,870
Neat.

5178
03:54:27,450 --> 03:54:28,090
Oh wait.

5179
03:54:33,130 --> 03:54:33,530
Wait.

5180
03:54:33,970 --> 03:54:38,230
Oh my god!

5181
03:54:38,510 --> 03:54:39,730
He loses frames!

5182
03:54:39,930 --> 03:54:41,610
He becomes like 5 frames per second!

5183
03:54:41,610 --> 03:54:43,310
Ha ha ha ha ha!

5184
03:54:44,770 --> 03:54:45,850
Ha ha ha ha!

5185
03:54:46,190 --> 03:54:46,630
Ha

5186
03:54:51,460 --> 03:54:52,000
ha ha ha!

5187
03:54:52,000 --> 03:54:52,780
Oh my gosh!

5188
03:54:52,880 --> 03:54:53,460
That's so funny!

5189
03:54:55,980 --> 03:54:57,140
Not so fast!

5190
03:54:58,500 --> 03:54:59,080
Got it!

5191
03:54:59,320 --> 03:54:59,620
Woo!

5192
03:55:01,740 --> 03:55:02,560
That's fun.

5193
03:55:02,760 --> 03:55:02,960
Alright.

5194
03:55:03,260 --> 03:55:03,940
So now...

5195
03:55:03,940 --> 03:55:05,700
What I want to do is...

5196
03:55:05,700 --> 03:55:06,040
Uh...

5197
03:55:06,040 --> 03:55:06,660
Enemy settings?

5198
03:55:10,910 --> 03:55:11,850
Let's do that.

5199
03:55:11,850 --> 03:55:11,870
What?

5200
03:55:15,970 --> 03:55:16,490
Okay.

5201
03:55:22,590 --> 03:55:24,150
Oh but it's like so small.

5202
03:55:27,030 --> 03:55:27,790
Oh my god!

5203
03:55:27,970 --> 03:55:28,610
Steins gate!

5204
03:55:30,290 --> 03:55:31,210
Oh relax!

5205
03:55:31,790 --> 03:55:32,950
That's hard to...

5206
03:55:32,950 --> 03:55:33,810
Aim it.

5207
03:55:34,370 --> 03:55:36,430
I guess it's easier if I get him...

5208
03:55:36,430 --> 03:55:37,230
Bring him close to me.

5209
03:55:38,810 --> 03:55:39,890
If I'm like...

5210
03:55:39,890 --> 03:55:40,270
Come here!

5211
03:55:40,870 --> 03:55:41,250
Oh whoops!

5212
03:55:41,510 --> 03:55:41,950
Come here!

5213
03:55:47,950 --> 03:55:48,470
Hmm...

5214
03:55:48,470 --> 03:55:51,870
And then does this like make it a really big...

5215
03:55:52,390 --> 03:55:53,450
Take your time!

5216
03:55:53,770 --> 03:55:54,130
Yeah!

5217
03:55:54,630 --> 03:55:56,130
This is what the horse does.

5218
03:55:56,990 --> 03:55:58,250
But for how long?

5219
03:55:58,250 --> 03:55:58,490
Come on!

5220
03:56:05,270 --> 03:56:06,030
Wow!

5221
03:56:06,230 --> 03:56:07,510
That's quite a long time, no?

5222
03:56:09,170 --> 03:56:10,490
That's pretty long.

5223
03:56:11,830 --> 03:56:13,370
Dio liked that.

5224
03:56:17,770 --> 03:56:18,770
Nah, too slow!

5225
03:56:19,670 --> 03:56:20,650
Too slow!

5226
03:56:33,270 --> 03:56:33,650
Wait...

5227
03:56:34,030 --> 03:56:34,530
Uh...

5228
03:56:34,530 --> 03:56:35,010
Reset.

5229
03:56:37,210 --> 03:56:39,610
Cause what I wanna do is...

5230
03:56:39,610 --> 03:56:40,870
Is it any different?

5231
03:56:46,430 --> 03:56:48,510
Wait, what if I...

5232
03:56:53,350 --> 03:56:54,490
Okay, cool.

5233
03:56:55,310 --> 03:56:56,510
It's pretty much the same though.

5234
03:56:58,230 --> 03:56:59,270
Okie dokie!

5235
03:57:01,170 --> 03:57:02,890
Let's switch out our...

5236
03:57:02,890 --> 03:57:04,320
I'm gonna save up for...

5237
03:57:05,530 --> 03:57:06,930
Wiresnatch 3.

5238
03:57:09,170 --> 03:57:09,610
Um...

5239
03:57:11,150 --> 03:57:12,990
Let's see what else we can get after that.

5240
03:57:13,750 --> 03:57:16,390
I wanna get the breaker plus 3, but I will resist.

5241
03:57:23,410 --> 03:57:25,550
I'm gonna use this as a last resort.

5242
03:57:25,930 --> 03:57:26,190
Haha!

5243
03:57:28,170 --> 03:57:29,410
But I like rawhide.

5244
03:57:29,870 --> 03:57:31,390
I feel like I will use that.

5245
03:57:33,830 --> 03:57:34,310
Wait.

5246
03:57:34,630 --> 03:57:34,930
Go down.

5247
03:57:35,190 --> 03:57:35,570
Go down.

5248
03:57:35,870 --> 03:57:36,190
Go down.

5249
03:57:36,470 --> 03:57:37,250
Why don't you go down?

5250
03:57:37,910 --> 03:57:39,450
Maybe because I need to select it.

5251
03:57:40,810 --> 03:57:41,290
Um...

5252
03:57:41,290 --> 03:57:43,330
And this is the one...

5253
03:57:43,330 --> 03:57:45,170
This is...

5254
03:57:45,170 --> 03:57:45,850
Yeah.

5255
03:57:47,470 --> 03:57:48,930
That's the one...

5256
03:57:48,930 --> 03:57:49,630
Wait.

5257
03:57:49,850 --> 03:57:49,950
Nope.

5258
03:57:50,830 --> 03:57:51,270
Uh...

5259
03:57:51,270 --> 03:57:51,710
You...

5260
03:57:51,710 --> 03:57:52,350
Switch you out.

5261
03:57:52,470 --> 03:57:52,950
Okay, there we go.

5262
03:57:53,550 --> 03:57:54,650
Maybe I'll try that.

5263
03:57:54,930 --> 03:57:56,150
Yeah, this is DMC4.

5264
03:57:57,530 --> 03:57:59,210
And then this is the time stop.

5265
03:57:59,710 --> 03:58:00,050
Okay.

5266
03:58:00,250 --> 03:58:01,330
I'll try this.

5267
03:58:04,390 --> 03:58:04,870
Hmm...

5268
03:58:04,870 --> 03:58:05,650
No tomboy?

5269
03:58:06,250 --> 03:58:07,810
I don't have any tomboy.

5270
03:58:07,870 --> 03:58:09,210
I'd have to buy a new one.

5271
03:58:09,310 --> 03:58:09,990
That sucks.

5272
03:58:11,050 --> 03:58:12,750
I'd have to buy a new one.

5273
03:58:14,450 --> 03:58:15,830
Which I guess I could.

5274
03:58:18,630 --> 03:58:19,950
Yeah, we broke ours.

5275
03:58:20,810 --> 03:58:21,290
Eh...

5276
03:58:21,290 --> 03:58:22,230
How much is it?

5277
03:58:23,490 --> 03:58:24,330
A thousand.

5278
03:58:25,230 --> 03:58:25,850
I'll just...

5279
03:58:25,850 --> 03:58:26,730
I'll just try to rev.

5280
03:58:27,210 --> 03:58:28,250
I'll just try to rev.

5281
03:58:30,430 --> 03:58:31,570
I'm sure you'll find one.

5282
03:58:31,610 --> 03:58:32,170
I think so too.

5283
03:58:33,250 --> 03:58:34,270
I think we'll be good.

5284
03:58:35,450 --> 03:58:37,550
So, we've gone through mission...

5285
03:58:37,550 --> 03:58:39,650
Three, four, five, six...

5286
03:58:39,650 --> 03:58:40,710
We're on mission seven.

5287
03:58:40,850 --> 03:58:41,310
Let's go!

5288
03:58:41,550 --> 03:58:41,770
Wow!

5289
03:58:44,190 --> 03:58:44,630
We're...

5290
03:58:44,630 --> 03:58:45,730
We're going crazy.

5291
03:58:46,770 --> 03:58:47,390
You two please.

5292
03:58:47,630 --> 03:58:48,970
Is you two being a little stinker?

5293
03:58:55,520 --> 03:58:56,680
It's definitely not me.

5294
03:59:06,990 --> 03:59:08,330
Can I shoot this one from here?

5295
03:59:08,670 --> 03:59:09,410
No.

5296
03:59:14,840 --> 03:59:17,100
Oh, that one's blocked from...

5297
03:59:17,100 --> 03:59:18,160
Wow, that's kind of funny.

5298
03:59:19,060 --> 03:59:19,660
Alright.

5299
03:59:20,860 --> 03:59:21,060
Uh

5300
03:59:26,270 --> 03:59:26,350
oh.

5301
03:59:26,910 --> 03:59:27,630
New guys.

5302
03:59:28,090 --> 03:59:29,590
We got the lizard people.

5303
03:59:30,730 --> 03:59:31,250
Riot.

5304
03:59:38,220 --> 03:59:39,680
That's V's path.

5305
03:59:40,960 --> 03:59:41,560
Ah...

5306
03:59:41,560 --> 03:59:42,520
Well, where is he?

5307
03:59:42,720 --> 03:59:44,100
He's not doing a very good job.

5308
03:59:47,740 --> 03:59:48,980
Where is he at?

5309
03:59:51,840 --> 03:59:52,580
Lizard.

5310
03:59:55,180 --> 03:59:56,260
Oh no.

5311
03:59:56,800 --> 03:59:57,380
Oh no.

5312
04:00:03,460 --> 04:00:05,150
Wait, did I just blast that guy?

5313
04:00:07,910 --> 04:00:09,830
How did I blast him so easily?

5314
04:00:23,590 --> 04:00:24,190
Wait.

5315
04:00:25,510 --> 04:00:27,190
Stop parrying me!

5316
04:00:37,660 --> 04:00:38,220
Ah!

5317
04:00:38,520 --> 04:00:39,320
Dang it.

5318
04:00:43,660 --> 04:00:44,620
Ah, shoot.

5319
04:00:46,640 --> 04:00:47,780
Starring the DMC crew.

5320
04:00:48,140 --> 04:00:48,660
Let's go.

5321
04:00:48,840 --> 04:00:49,200
Come on!

5322
04:00:49,860 --> 04:00:50,380
Oh, nice.

5323
04:00:56,320 --> 04:00:56,880
Um...

5324
04:00:56,880 --> 04:00:58,500
I guess I just lost that arm.

5325
04:00:58,800 --> 04:00:59,080
Okay.

5326
04:01:01,260 --> 04:01:01,740
Posh.

5327
04:01:03,600 --> 04:01:04,940
Is he already out of here?

5328
04:01:05,300 --> 04:01:06,400
Dang, he's kind of fast.

5329
04:01:07,380 --> 04:01:09,400
You can follow if you want, but I'm going ahead.

5330
04:01:09,680 --> 04:01:10,000
Okay.

5331
04:01:13,520 --> 04:01:15,160
Yeah, follow if you want.

5332
04:01:15,160 --> 04:01:15,360
Damn it.

5333
04:01:21,630 --> 04:01:24,250
I feel so much more comfortable as Nero.

5334
04:01:26,650 --> 04:01:28,370
But I did like playing as V.

5335
04:01:30,630 --> 04:01:31,990
I think V is...

5336
04:01:32,910 --> 04:01:34,150
I don't want to say easier.

5337
04:01:34,730 --> 04:01:36,030
Easier is not the right word.

5338
04:01:40,690 --> 04:01:41,290
Orb.

5339
04:01:43,430 --> 04:01:45,410
Got the classic buster arm, baby.

5340
04:01:46,710 --> 04:01:48,190
Grab him and smash him.

5341
04:01:49,730 --> 04:01:50,650
A classic...

5342
04:01:51,190 --> 04:01:52,510
Classic buster arm move.

5343
04:01:53,970 --> 04:01:57,530
I still like just being able to beat up anything that I like so easily.

5344
04:01:57,710 --> 04:01:58,130
You know what I mean?

5345
04:02:00,130 --> 04:02:00,590
Oh.

5346
04:02:06,270 --> 04:02:07,030
Where are you?

5347
04:02:17,050 --> 04:02:17,690
We got...

5348
04:02:17,690 --> 04:02:17,790
Oh!

5349
04:02:17,970 --> 04:02:18,430
We got hel...

5350
04:02:18,430 --> 04:02:19,230
Hel...

5351
04:02:19,230 --> 04:02:20,310
Helter skill through.

5352
04:02:24,610 --> 04:02:27,890
If you attack just before she lands a hit to open up, it's been secure.

5353
04:02:29,270 --> 04:02:30,230
Wait, who's she?

5354
04:02:31,450 --> 04:02:33,030
It's my birthday, Omni!

5355
04:02:33,650 --> 04:02:37,390
In lieu of a song, could you tell us a heartfelt compliment for one of the sloppy sisters?

5356
04:02:37,610 --> 04:02:38,130
Your pick.

5357
04:02:41,610 --> 04:02:42,450
A compliment...

5358
04:02:42,450 --> 04:02:43,610
Happy birthday, Omni!

5359
04:02:43,610 --> 04:02:46,850
A compliment for one of the sloppy sisters.

5360
04:02:48,170 --> 04:02:48,930
Um...

5361
04:02:48,930 --> 04:02:49,630
Oh, death scissors.

5362
04:02:51,390 --> 04:02:51,770
Um...

5363
04:02:55,940 --> 04:02:56,700
Uh...

5364
04:02:56,700 --> 04:02:59,000
I will say one for each person.

5365
04:03:01,000 --> 04:03:01,760
Um...

5366
04:03:01,760 --> 04:03:03,700
I love how...

5367
04:03:04,740 --> 04:03:05,420
Um...

5368
04:03:05,420 --> 04:03:07,240
How silly Snuffy is.

5369
04:03:07,400 --> 04:03:08,140
And how...

5370
04:03:08,140 --> 04:03:11,120
Great of a yes and kind of...

5371
04:03:11,760 --> 04:03:12,260
Um...

5372
04:03:12,260 --> 04:03:12,900
Uh...

5373
04:03:12,900 --> 04:03:14,160
Person she is.

5374
04:03:14,500 --> 04:03:14,800
Uh...

5375
04:03:14,800 --> 04:03:17,800
Those are always the most fun to be able to collab with.

5376
04:03:18,360 --> 04:03:20,500
And she's just so silly and cute.

5377
04:03:20,700 --> 04:03:21,500
And I like that.

5378
04:03:22,300 --> 04:03:22,840
Uh...

5379
04:03:22,840 --> 04:03:22,980
Uh...

5380
04:03:22,980 --> 04:03:23,780
With Laimu.

5381
04:03:23,920 --> 04:03:24,820
I love how...

5382
04:03:24,820 --> 04:03:27,880
Level-headed and dependable she is.

5383
04:03:28,020 --> 04:03:28,860
And how...

5384
04:03:28,860 --> 04:03:29,620
I...

5385
04:03:29,620 --> 04:03:30,140
Um...

5386
04:03:30,140 --> 04:03:34,360
Really admire that she's just got such a great head on her shoulders.

5387
04:03:34,540 --> 04:03:36,640
And she's just such a sweetie pie.

5388
04:03:36,800 --> 04:03:37,620
And I really love her.

5389
04:03:38,140 --> 04:03:38,600
And...

5390
04:03:38,600 --> 04:03:38,900
Doki!

5391
04:03:46,420 --> 04:03:48,360
Not gonna give you guys a satisfaction.

5392
04:03:48,360 --> 04:03:49,920
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

5393
04:03:53,280 --> 04:03:53,940
Ewww...

5394
04:04:01,910 --> 04:04:02,570
Dammit.

5395
04:04:02,710 --> 04:04:03,050
I miss.

5396
04:04:07,210 --> 04:04:09,570
Oh, I forgot that I wasn't using...

5397
04:04:25,970 --> 04:04:26,630
Gross!

5398
04:04:32,710 --> 04:04:33,370
Yeah!

5399
04:04:33,730 --> 04:04:34,310
There we go.

5400
04:04:40,800 --> 04:04:41,460
Nice.

5401
04:04:42,320 --> 04:04:42,980
Oop.

5402
04:04:43,800 --> 04:04:44,100
Yeah!

5403
04:04:44,100 --> 04:04:44,200
Yeah!

5404
04:04:45,890 --> 04:04:46,820
Jelly donut.

5405
04:04:47,720 --> 04:04:48,880
That's the...

5406
04:04:48,880 --> 04:04:51,600
Juiciest jelly donut I'll have ever had.

5407
04:04:52,000 --> 04:04:54,100
Rise and fall of Spencer.

5408
04:04:55,460 --> 04:04:56,240
God, these...

5409
04:04:56,240 --> 04:04:58,130
These signs are made of...

5410
04:04:59,360 --> 04:05:00,180
Cardboard.

5411
04:05:02,060 --> 04:05:03,280
Who's Spencer?

5412
04:05:05,850 --> 04:05:07,450
The night just started.

5413
04:05:08,780 --> 04:05:10,580
I like these ads they're selling.

5414
04:05:13,040 --> 04:05:14,120
What are you wearing?

5415
04:05:15,440 --> 04:05:15,940
What are you wearing?

5416
04:05:15,940 --> 04:05:15,960
Hey.

5417
04:05:16,540 --> 04:05:17,420
Hi, Orca.

5418
04:05:18,280 --> 04:05:18,980
You know, Orca.

5419
04:05:19,000 --> 04:05:20,220
I'm pretty sure you're...

5420
04:05:20,220 --> 04:05:21,780
Shadow banned for me on Twitter.

5421
04:05:32,590 --> 04:05:33,290
Cold drinks!

5422
04:05:37,010 --> 04:05:38,410
Clearly she had...

5423
04:05:38,410 --> 04:05:39,350
Choice paralysis.

5424
04:05:40,330 --> 04:05:40,770
Wait, what?

5425
04:05:41,010 --> 04:05:41,470
Hold on.

5426
04:05:41,870 --> 04:05:42,570
Oh my gosh, sorry.

5427
04:05:42,690 --> 04:05:43,510
I have to keep...

5428
04:05:44,010 --> 04:05:45,650
I have to keep pausing to...

5429
04:05:45,650 --> 04:05:46,670
To read your...

5430
04:05:46,670 --> 04:05:47,210
Super chats.

5431
04:05:47,310 --> 04:05:47,950
If they go too fast.

5432
04:05:49,430 --> 04:05:49,950
She had...

5433
04:05:49,950 --> 04:05:51,670
Choice paralysis for Doki's compliment.

5434
04:05:51,910 --> 04:05:52,070
Right?

5435
04:05:52,630 --> 04:05:53,110
Right?

5436
04:05:56,370 --> 04:05:57,430
What did Orca do?

5437
04:05:57,530 --> 04:05:57,950
I don't know.

5438
04:05:58,150 --> 04:05:58,610
It's what...

5439
04:05:58,610 --> 04:06:00,150
It's not me that did it.

5440
04:06:00,290 --> 04:06:00,810
It's Twitter.

5441
04:06:03,550 --> 04:06:04,250
I don't know.

5442
04:06:04,370 --> 04:06:05,310
Maybe the name...

5443
04:06:05,310 --> 04:06:06,590
Areola enjoyer...

5444
04:06:06,590 --> 04:06:07,430
Just kind of like...

5445
04:06:07,430 --> 04:06:08,490
Struck a nerve with him.

5446
04:06:10,630 --> 04:06:11,070
Oop.

5447
04:06:11,990 --> 04:06:12,150
Oop.

5448
04:06:36,630 --> 04:06:37,270
Dang it.

5449
04:07:17,270 --> 04:07:18,730
I think I just lost my arm.

5450
04:07:19,030 --> 04:07:19,670
Ha ha ha ha.

5451
04:07:29,710 --> 04:07:31,190
Oh, I always forget to...

5452
04:07:31,190 --> 04:07:31,990
Jump up with them.

5453
04:07:42,140 --> 04:07:43,020
There we go.

5454
04:07:44,140 --> 04:07:45,040
Holy cow.

5455
04:07:45,260 --> 04:07:46,240
I always end up...

5456
04:07:46,240 --> 04:07:47,880
Accidentally losing my arms.

5457
04:07:48,160 --> 04:07:48,800
Ha ha ha ha.

5458
04:07:52,520 --> 04:07:54,040
Kinda sucks, actually.

5459
04:07:54,540 --> 04:07:55,100
Because...

5460
04:07:55,100 --> 04:07:57,040
It's not that I'll be weak without them.

5461
04:07:57,520 --> 04:07:58,460
But like, it's...

5462
04:07:58,460 --> 04:08:00,160
Kinda just sucks.

5463
04:08:01,540 --> 04:08:03,640
I'm gonna have to buy so many of them.

5464
04:08:03,820 --> 04:08:04,360
Sheila!

5465
04:08:06,740 --> 04:08:07,820
Smoking sensation.

5466
04:08:09,140 --> 04:08:11,300
I would like to view the show.

5467
04:08:12,000 --> 04:08:12,600
Oh.

5468
04:08:17,010 --> 04:08:18,230
Oh, what's going on?

5469
04:08:18,510 --> 04:08:18,730
Oh.

5470
04:08:19,610 --> 04:08:20,150
Oh!

5471
04:08:20,550 --> 04:08:21,490
We just got that guy.

5472
04:08:21,590 --> 04:08:21,710
Oh!

5473
04:08:22,770 --> 04:08:23,690
What did you...

5474
04:08:26,190 --> 04:08:28,250
Fear that I must destroy these?

5475
04:08:30,850 --> 04:08:31,450
Woo!

5476
04:08:39,220 --> 04:08:40,400
Where'd that guy go?

5477
04:08:41,300 --> 04:08:41,900
Hello?

5478
04:08:43,820 --> 04:08:44,420
Crawly?

5479
04:08:45,640 --> 04:08:46,600
Wait, where'd he go?

5480
04:08:47,240 --> 04:08:48,300
Did he des- Did he spawn?

5481
04:08:49,460 --> 04:08:51,640
What a little wimp!

5482
04:08:52,920 --> 04:08:54,580
What a little doofus!

5483
04:08:57,660 --> 04:08:59,560
No, he ran away.

5484
04:09:00,820 --> 04:09:02,060
Aw, man.

5485
04:09:02,480 --> 04:09:03,300
It's okay.

5486
04:09:06,440 --> 04:09:08,620
It's fine, I guess.

5487
04:09:08,620 --> 04:09:08,780
Yes.

5488
04:09:12,740 --> 04:09:13,620
Coward baby.

5489
04:09:13,920 --> 04:09:14,440
So true!

5490
04:09:14,740 --> 04:09:16,040
That's exactly what I was thinking.

5491
04:09:17,380 --> 04:09:18,260
Oh, okay.

5492
04:09:18,480 --> 04:09:19,420
There's no going back.

5493
04:09:20,240 --> 04:09:21,520
Hope you got what you wanted.

5494
04:09:23,160 --> 04:09:23,800
Or wait.

5495
04:09:24,340 --> 04:09:25,600
Oh, this is the way back.

5496
04:09:25,800 --> 04:09:26,360
Just kidding.

5497
04:09:27,500 --> 04:09:27,920
Ow!

5498
04:09:28,000 --> 04:09:29,240
We're going down here.

5499
04:09:29,440 --> 04:09:29,520
Okay.

5500
04:09:30,320 --> 04:09:31,280
Did I get everything in here?

5501
04:09:31,360 --> 04:09:32,120
Let me just double check.

5502
04:09:33,900 --> 04:09:34,460
Yes.

5503
04:09:41,460 --> 04:09:42,700
There's V over there.

5504
04:09:43,380 --> 04:09:44,060
Doing something.

5505
04:09:44,220 --> 04:09:44,600
I hear something.

5506
04:09:47,240 --> 04:09:48,520
I hear someone.

5507
04:09:48,880 --> 04:09:49,700
I hear V, I think.

5508
04:09:50,320 --> 04:09:50,880
What's he doing?

5509
04:09:51,620 --> 04:09:52,860
The DMC crew!

5510
04:09:52,860 --> 04:09:52,940
Woo!

5511
04:10:00,960 --> 04:10:01,560
Where are you?

5512
04:10:01,740 --> 04:10:02,520
Oh, there he is!

5513
04:10:03,600 --> 04:10:04,920
I wish I could go help him.

5514
04:10:07,460 --> 04:10:08,540
I got my own stuff.

5515
04:10:10,900 --> 04:10:11,460
Nailed it!

5516
04:10:13,020 --> 04:10:14,560
Oh, this thing again.

5517
04:10:17,200 --> 04:10:18,080
Oh, hell no.

5518
04:10:18,300 --> 04:10:20,320
I'm not letting this spawn any more of these guys.

5519
04:10:20,320 --> 04:10:23,740
Oh, ha, ha, ha, ha.

5520
04:10:40,340 --> 04:10:40,860
Woo!

5521
04:10:48,800 --> 04:10:50,080
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

5522
04:10:50,340 --> 04:10:51,040
Get me out of here.

5523
04:11:10,150 --> 04:11:11,310
Leave me alone!

5524
04:11:24,460 --> 04:11:28,240
Oh, we got another helter skelter, baby.

5525
04:11:44,740 --> 04:11:46,860
This place is so...

5526
04:11:46,860 --> 04:11:47,820
crawling.

5527
04:11:49,140 --> 04:11:52,360
If you were able to be in a video game, what would you like best?

5528
04:11:52,740 --> 04:11:57,060
And would you terribly mind the above average being dead angst?

5529
04:11:57,680 --> 04:12:00,060
Unless that's not the ghost mate's cup of tea.

5530
04:12:00,500 --> 04:12:01,280
Wait, what do you mean?

5531
04:12:04,980 --> 04:12:05,500
Um...

5532
04:12:05,500 --> 04:12:06,920
That's a ghost mate.

5533
04:12:07,340 --> 04:12:08,080
That's a ghost.

5534
04:12:08,560 --> 04:12:10,000
There's always gonna be angst.

5535
04:12:10,260 --> 04:12:11,120
Cause you're dead!

5536
04:12:13,200 --> 04:12:14,580
Wait, is V down here?

5537
04:12:14,780 --> 04:12:15,080
Still?

5538
04:12:16,500 --> 04:12:17,020
Nope.

5539
04:12:18,640 --> 04:12:19,660
What game though?

5540
04:12:20,900 --> 04:12:21,860
Smash Bros.

5541
04:12:31,710 --> 04:12:32,190
Um...

5542
04:12:32,190 --> 04:12:35,770
Well, if I'm a ghost in any game, I could probably just take it easy.

5543
04:12:35,890 --> 04:12:37,390
Unless it's like Luigi's Mansion.

5544
04:12:39,410 --> 04:12:42,370
So definitely not Luigi's Mansion.

5545
04:12:43,030 --> 04:12:44,570
Do not wanna be in there.

5546
04:13:02,200 --> 04:13:03,360
A warrior?

5547
04:13:08,540 --> 04:13:10,920
But it's the human that kisses the ghost.

5548
04:13:11,460 --> 04:13:11,800
The girl.

5549
04:13:16,480 --> 04:13:16,920
Hmm...

5550
04:13:16,920 --> 04:13:17,480
I don't know.

5551
04:13:18,820 --> 04:13:19,980
I feel like...

5552
04:13:19,980 --> 04:13:21,280
I feel like a...

5553
04:13:21,280 --> 04:13:21,800
Like a...

5554
04:13:22,620 --> 04:13:25,320
Animal Crossing is such an easy answer, you know?

5555
04:13:25,480 --> 04:13:26,640
But it's kind of a cop-out.

5556
04:13:26,780 --> 04:13:27,660
Cause it's just like...

5557
04:13:27,660 --> 04:13:27,980
Ah, yeah.

5558
04:13:28,540 --> 04:13:29,760
Taking it easy, baby.

5559
04:13:31,640 --> 04:13:32,680
Where are you?

5560
04:13:33,700 --> 04:13:34,060
To...

5561
04:13:34,700 --> 04:13:35,060
Oh.

5562
04:13:44,850 --> 04:13:45,570
Metal Gear...

5563
04:13:45,570 --> 04:13:46,150
Metal Gear?

5564
04:13:47,230 --> 04:13:48,290
Oh, TFC2 style.

5565
04:13:50,950 --> 04:13:51,530
Oh, ow.

5566
04:13:51,630 --> 04:13:52,590
Why did I go into it?

5567
04:13:52,650 --> 04:13:53,390
Why am I so stupid?

5568
04:13:54,950 --> 04:13:56,170
Sorry, I got Metal Gear on the brain.

5569
04:13:56,790 --> 04:13:59,090
Probably because you asked me what world I would wanna live in.

5570
04:13:59,230 --> 04:14:00,450
And I can't just say Metal Gear!

5571
04:14:01,370 --> 04:14:03,670
Because I don't think I would wanna live in that world!

5572
04:14:10,290 --> 04:14:10,770
Oh

5573
04:14:16,460 --> 04:14:16,780
my gosh!

5574
04:14:17,020 --> 04:14:17,820
Where did you come from?

5575
04:14:23,400 --> 04:14:23,880
Please.

5576
04:14:25,680 --> 04:14:26,160
Oh,

5577
04:14:30,640 --> 04:14:32,060
I can't tell which way I'm facing.

5578
04:14:33,020 --> 04:14:34,580
To do the combo.

5579
04:14:50,730 --> 04:14:51,990
I'm attacking you instead.

5580
04:14:53,810 --> 04:14:54,290
Oh!

5581
04:14:57,330 --> 04:14:58,310
Where'd you come from?

5582
04:14:58,310 --> 04:14:59,250
Oh, they're back!

5583
04:14:59,450 --> 04:14:59,850
They're both back!

5584
04:15:01,950 --> 04:15:02,890
What, the other one's back?

5585
04:15:03,030 --> 04:15:03,250
Ah!

5586
04:15:03,390 --> 04:15:03,910
There's three of them!

5587
04:15:08,170 --> 04:15:09,290
There's so many of them!

5588
04:15:12,870 --> 04:15:13,590
Oh my

5589
04:15:20,040 --> 04:15:20,100
god.

5590
04:15:20,260 --> 04:15:20,420
Ah!

5591
04:15:20,440 --> 04:15:21,300
There's these guys too!

5592
04:15:21,660 --> 04:15:22,260
Oh my god.

5593
04:15:26,220 --> 04:15:26,580
Ah!

5594
04:15:26,780 --> 04:15:28,000
No, I think I just broke my arm.

5595
04:15:28,180 --> 04:15:28,600
That sucks.

5596
04:15:38,070 --> 04:15:38,470
Oh!

5597
04:15:39,830 --> 04:15:40,230
Noooo!

5598
04:15:45,280 --> 04:15:45,680
Oh!

5599
04:15:45,880 --> 04:15:46,060
Please!

5600
04:15:46,360 --> 04:15:46,480
Dodge!

5601
04:15:46,940 --> 04:15:47,100
Dodge!

5602
04:15:47,600 --> 04:15:47,640
Dodge!

5603
04:15:48,080 --> 04:15:48,200
Dodge!

5604
04:15:48,220 --> 04:15:48,860
Oh my god.

5605
04:15:48,940 --> 04:15:50,380
I'm gonna run out of arms for real.

5606
04:16:10,710 --> 04:16:11,370
Yeah!

5607
04:16:11,790 --> 04:16:12,290
Parry!

5608
04:16:16,130 --> 04:16:16,930
Come here.

5609
04:16:19,070 --> 04:16:19,570
Oh!

5610
04:16:19,650 --> 04:16:20,630
He like, corrects himself.

5611
04:16:20,830 --> 04:16:21,450
That's kinda crazy.

5612
04:16:22,130 --> 04:16:22,610
Oh!

5613
04:16:23,090 --> 04:16:23,290
John!

5614
04:16:23,970 --> 04:16:25,930
I hate these guys so much!

5615
04:16:26,810 --> 04:16:29,110
I think I might actually prefer the scissor guy.

5616
04:16:30,630 --> 04:16:33,330
I think I might prefer the scissor guy over these guys.

5617
04:16:34,490 --> 04:16:35,450
Holy cow!

5618
04:16:45,160 --> 04:16:46,060
They're tough.

5619
04:16:48,240 --> 04:16:48,880
They're...

5620
04:16:48,880 --> 04:16:49,120
Oh!

5621
04:16:49,200 --> 04:16:49,700
Buster arm.

5622
04:16:49,920 --> 04:16:51,460
I was like, I think I see...

5623
04:16:52,280 --> 04:16:53,740
Something glowing here.

5624
04:16:55,880 --> 04:16:57,180
You still win those.

5625
04:16:58,800 --> 04:16:59,280
Somehow...

5626
04:16:59,280 --> 04:17:00,120
Oh my gosh.

5627
04:17:00,320 --> 04:17:00,920
We're doing what...

5628
04:17:00,920 --> 04:17:02,480
I've always dreamed of doing this.

5629
04:17:02,620 --> 04:17:04,280
I've always wanted to go...

5630
04:17:04,280 --> 04:17:04,680
Oh no.

5631
04:17:04,880 --> 04:17:05,340
I see them.

5632
04:17:17,310 --> 04:17:19,210
I've always wanted to go...

5633
04:17:19,910 --> 04:17:21,910
Up a down escalator.

5634
04:17:22,290 --> 04:17:22,870
You know?

5635
04:17:24,690 --> 04:17:26,250
Oh, what the hell is this?

5636
04:17:30,840 --> 04:17:32,260
Not while I'm getting attacked.

5637
04:17:32,520 --> 04:17:32,620
No!

5638
04:17:33,940 --> 04:17:35,320
Wait, this is so evil!

5639
04:17:35,700 --> 04:17:36,140
Oh my god.

5640
04:17:36,160 --> 04:17:37,540
I said the scissor man and he appeared.

5641
04:17:37,820 --> 04:17:39,260
Oh, I hate jinxing.

5642
04:17:39,340 --> 04:17:39,860
I hate...

5643
04:17:39,860 --> 04:17:41,040
I hate my...

5644
04:17:41,680 --> 04:17:42,120
Prophetic...

5645
04:17:42,120 --> 04:17:43,240
Why am I...

5646
04:17:43,240 --> 04:17:43,660
Why...

5647
04:17:43,660 --> 04:17:45,260
Why do I always know what's gonna happen?

5648
04:17:46,440 --> 04:17:46,880
No!

5649
04:17:52,120 --> 04:17:53,040
I hate...

5650
04:17:53,040 --> 04:17:54,360
I hate having the gift of prophecy!

5651
04:17:55,700 --> 04:17:56,260
Please!

5652
04:17:58,440 --> 04:17:59,000
Please!

5653
04:18:11,650 --> 04:18:12,370
Come here.

5654
04:18:17,010 --> 04:18:17,890
Oh gosh.

5655
04:18:20,830 --> 04:18:21,390
Oh

5656
04:18:27,550 --> 04:18:27,810
my god.

5657
04:18:27,830 --> 04:18:29,030
Where did you get your sword back?

5658
04:18:29,170 --> 04:18:29,450
Or...

5659
04:18:29,450 --> 04:18:31,430
Oh, I only broke half of it.

5660
04:18:34,630 --> 04:18:35,190
Please.

5661
04:18:35,190 --> 04:18:35,230
Please.

5662
04:18:37,710 --> 04:18:38,850
This is so confusing.

5663
04:18:40,550 --> 04:18:40,990
Ouch.

5664
04:18:54,220 --> 04:18:55,080
Oh, there they...

5665
04:18:55,080 --> 04:18:55,840
I was like, could I...

5666
04:19:14,010 --> 04:19:15,630
They're trying their best.

5667
04:19:16,830 --> 04:19:18,370
This is so sad.

5668
04:19:18,770 --> 04:19:19,710
Oh, they're really trying.

5669
04:19:25,990 --> 04:19:27,730
I'm just gonna put them out of their misery.

5670
04:19:27,730 --> 04:19:27,830
Sorry.

5671
04:19:57,140 --> 04:19:58,360
That was so funny.

5672
04:19:58,900 --> 04:20:00,880
I was like, why isn't the music stopping?

5673
04:20:02,640 --> 04:20:03,520
That's cold.

5674
04:20:03,520 --> 04:20:04,060
I know.

5675
04:20:04,660 --> 04:20:08,620
I could ask you what your favorite weather is, and somehow you'd start thinking about Metal Gear.

5676
04:20:08,740 --> 04:20:09,000
Yeah!

5677
04:20:09,400 --> 04:20:10,100
Yeah, sorry.

5678
04:20:12,440 --> 04:20:13,260
Yeah, sorry.

5679
04:20:19,250 --> 04:20:20,070
Oh my god.

5680
04:20:27,100 --> 04:20:29,180
I need to focus on this first!

5681
04:20:29,380 --> 04:20:29,620
Do it!

5682
04:20:36,230 --> 04:20:37,010
There we go.

5683
04:20:37,390 --> 04:20:37,670
Alright.

5684
04:20:37,910 --> 04:20:38,170
Come here.

5685
04:20:41,580 --> 04:20:42,180
Oh no!

5686
04:20:42,260 --> 04:20:42,960
Is this gonna break it?

5687
04:20:43,720 --> 04:20:44,600
Oh, it didn't.

5688
04:20:49,680 --> 04:20:50,160
Yeah!

5689
04:20:50,420 --> 04:20:50,660
Yeah!

5690
04:20:51,020 --> 04:20:51,220
Yeah!

5691
04:20:51,620 --> 04:20:52,100
Yeah!

5692
04:20:58,610 --> 04:20:59,090
Yeah!

5693
04:20:59,390 --> 04:20:59,670
Yeah!

5694
04:20:59,670 --> 04:20:59,730
Yeah!

5695
04:20:59,730 --> 04:20:59,830
Yeah!

5696
04:21:19,850 --> 04:21:21,700
Oh, I miss you so much.

5697
04:21:22,130 --> 04:21:23,550
My sweet, sweet arm.

5698
04:21:25,170 --> 04:21:25,830
Classic.

5699
04:21:26,250 --> 04:21:26,550
Yeah!

5700
04:21:28,610 --> 04:21:29,270
Classic.

5701
04:21:30,970 --> 04:21:31,630
Mural.

5702
04:21:33,710 --> 04:21:34,810
Buster arm.

5703
04:21:35,090 --> 04:21:35,290
Woo!

5704
04:21:37,120 --> 04:21:38,330
Anything else around here?

5705
04:21:41,430 --> 04:21:42,510
Oh, this...

5706
04:21:42,510 --> 04:21:43,570
This one doesn't work, huh?

5707
04:21:44,650 --> 04:21:45,310
Oh.

5708
04:21:46,390 --> 04:21:47,470
There we go.

5709
04:21:51,010 --> 04:21:52,110
Phone?

5710
04:21:52,570 --> 04:21:53,430
Wait, did I miss her?

5711
04:21:54,530 --> 04:21:55,190
Where at?

5712
04:22:04,870 --> 04:22:05,420
Here?

5713
04:22:06,060 --> 04:22:06,800
No.

5714
04:22:08,260 --> 04:22:09,400
Oh, I see it!

5715
04:22:12,850 --> 04:22:14,040
Moshi Moshi!

5716
04:22:16,080 --> 04:22:17,720
Nico-chan!

5717
04:22:18,680 --> 04:22:19,040
Hi!

5718
04:22:19,800 --> 04:22:21,420
Nani ga suki?

5719
04:22:23,320 --> 04:22:23,980
Watashi!

5720
04:22:24,780 --> 04:22:26,680
Lord, I've got a job for you.

5721
04:22:35,450 --> 04:22:36,110
She's...

5722
04:22:41,210 --> 04:22:41,870
Madam!

5723
04:22:48,460 --> 04:22:50,410
I love the way that she is.

5724
04:22:51,470 --> 04:22:52,730
I have slots for two.

5725
04:22:53,570 --> 04:22:54,570
Oh, but you know what?

5726
04:22:54,770 --> 04:22:55,810
I do have...

5727
04:22:57,610 --> 04:22:58,470
I can just...

5728
04:22:58,470 --> 04:22:59,430
I don't have to buy some yet.

5729
04:23:00,270 --> 04:23:03,170
In fact, I'm just gonna keep one open because we find them...

5730
04:23:03,170 --> 04:23:04,550
We find them not...

5731
04:23:05,570 --> 04:23:06,370
Not so...

5732
04:23:06,370 --> 04:23:07,170
Like...

5733
04:23:07,170 --> 04:23:08,850
We find them pretty often is what I'm trying to say.

5734
04:23:08,850 --> 04:23:08,870
Alright.

5735
04:23:09,210 --> 04:23:11,730
So now we have Wire Snatch 3, baby!

5736
04:23:12,350 --> 04:23:12,510
Yeah!

5737
04:23:14,790 --> 04:23:16,730
I think this might have to be my last mission though, you guys.

5738
04:23:16,830 --> 04:23:19,090
I was gonna play longer, but my eyes are killing me.

5739
04:23:19,690 --> 04:23:20,510
I don't know why.

5740
04:23:20,990 --> 04:23:24,730
Sometimes my eyes are just...

5741
04:23:24,730 --> 04:23:26,030
Maybe I can do another mission.

5742
04:23:26,190 --> 04:23:26,370
We'll see.

5743
04:23:32,830 --> 04:23:34,670
A hundred hours into blueprints?

5744
04:23:34,790 --> 04:23:35,190
Oh my god.

5745
04:23:39,010 --> 04:23:41,130
We'll see how I'm feeling once we get through this mission.

5746
04:23:43,330 --> 04:23:44,990
I plan on playing longer though.

5747
04:23:45,170 --> 04:23:46,170
I wanted to play like...

5748
04:23:47,210 --> 04:23:48,450
Like three more hours.

5749
04:23:49,470 --> 04:23:50,490
I might though.

5750
04:23:51,650 --> 04:23:52,090
We'll...

5751
04:23:52,090 --> 04:23:53,010
Actually, no.

5752
04:23:53,310 --> 04:23:54,330
We'll see once I...

5753
04:23:55,370 --> 04:23:56,770
I can buy a Bor...

5754
04:23:57,390 --> 04:23:57,870
Bloor...

5755
04:23:58,490 --> 04:24:00,210
We'll see how I am...

5756
04:24:01,050 --> 04:24:01,530
Um...

5757
04:24:02,950 --> 04:24:03,990
At the end of this.

5758
04:24:05,630 --> 04:24:06,110
Or...

5759
04:24:06,110 --> 04:24:08,910
It might take me three hours to beat a single boss, you know?

5760
04:24:10,830 --> 04:24:11,730
More Bloor.

5761
04:24:11,850 --> 04:24:12,350
More Bloor.

5762
04:24:12,490 --> 04:24:12,930
More Bloor.

5763
04:24:13,170 --> 04:24:13,770
Where are we going?

5764
04:24:14,670 --> 04:24:15,150
Adjustment.

5765
04:24:16,150 --> 04:24:16,970
Hate that place.

5766
04:24:24,840 --> 04:24:26,160
Next mission's pretty long.

5767
04:24:26,360 --> 04:24:26,720
Okay.

5768
04:24:27,580 --> 04:24:28,980
Then maybe we will cut it here.

5769
04:24:29,200 --> 04:24:30,020
After this mission.

5770
04:24:31,140 --> 04:24:31,940
Woah.

5771
04:24:32,620 --> 04:24:32,840
Woah.

5772
04:24:33,580 --> 04:24:33,960
Oh my god.

5773
04:24:34,400 --> 04:24:35,200
Cinematic.

5774
04:24:35,820 --> 04:24:36,220
Wow.

5775
04:24:37,220 --> 04:24:38,160
That's awesome.

5776
04:24:49,410 --> 04:24:50,210
Okay.

5777
04:24:51,350 --> 04:24:51,910
Okay.

5778
04:24:52,450 --> 04:24:52,990
Let's see.

5779
04:24:53,230 --> 04:24:53,670
Over here.

5780
04:24:55,530 --> 04:24:56,150
Woah.

5781
04:24:56,450 --> 04:24:56,890
Gosh.

5782
04:24:57,410 --> 04:24:58,690
You scared the heck out of me.

5783
04:25:05,510 --> 04:25:06,310
This...

5784
04:25:06,310 --> 04:25:06,830
Ouch.

5785
04:25:07,670 --> 04:25:09,050
I did not...

5786
04:25:09,050 --> 04:25:09,430
I did not...

5787
04:25:12,710 --> 04:25:13,510
There's no...

5788
04:25:13,930 --> 04:25:14,330
Wait.

5789
04:25:14,430 --> 04:25:15,590
I don't want to touch you just yet.

5790
04:25:15,950 --> 04:25:16,070
Oh.

5791
04:25:16,390 --> 04:25:16,710
Just kidding.

5792
04:25:16,870 --> 04:25:17,610
I do want to touch you.

5793
04:25:17,950 --> 04:25:18,250
Okay.

5794
04:25:20,110 --> 04:25:22,190
What's the best way to handle this, you guys?

5795
04:25:30,710 --> 04:25:31,110
Oh.

5796
04:25:45,690 --> 04:25:48,350
I'm trying to rev, but I'm not doing a very good job at it.

5797
04:25:48,970 --> 04:25:49,370
No!

5798
04:25:51,230 --> 04:25:52,190
I tried.

5799
04:25:55,010 --> 04:25:55,870
I tried.

5800
04:25:56,070 --> 04:25:56,310
I tried.

5801
04:25:56,310 --> 04:25:56,470
I tried.

5802
04:25:56,930 --> 04:25:57,530
I tried.

5803
04:25:57,530 --> 04:25:58,150
There was an attempt.

5804
04:26:02,250 --> 04:26:03,790
There was an attempt.

5805
04:26:04,570 --> 04:26:05,170
Masapako!

5806
04:26:05,590 --> 04:26:06,690
Thank you so much for the break!

5807
04:26:07,390 --> 04:26:08,450
Hello, hello, hello.

5808
04:26:09,170 --> 04:26:10,430
Hi, hi, hi.

5809
04:26:10,910 --> 04:26:12,190
Hope you had a good stream.

5810
04:26:16,250 --> 04:26:18,770
I'm just playing some more Devil May Cry.

5811
04:26:19,650 --> 04:26:21,010
I ain't crying yet though.

5812
04:26:21,650 --> 04:26:23,210
But these guys in chat...

5813
04:26:24,690 --> 04:26:26,050
That's another story.

5814
04:26:27,270 --> 04:26:27,910
Okay.

5815
04:26:27,910 --> 04:26:29,810
I think we gotta slide down here.

5816
04:26:30,530 --> 04:26:31,090
Oh!

5817
04:26:33,910 --> 04:26:34,470
Spooky.

5818
04:26:35,190 --> 04:26:38,450
Oh my gosh!

5819
04:26:39,050 --> 04:26:40,130
We're going to the opera!

5820
04:26:41,270 --> 04:26:42,830
We are going to the opera!

5821
04:26:44,070 --> 04:26:45,410
I know it, right?

5822
04:26:45,870 --> 04:26:46,970
Wee, wee, wee!

5823
04:26:53,290 --> 04:26:53,850
Uni!

5824
04:26:54,230 --> 04:26:55,310
Thank you so much for the podcast!

5825
04:26:55,550 --> 04:26:56,150
Thank you!

5826
04:26:56,890 --> 04:26:57,810
Thank you!

5827
04:26:59,390 --> 04:27:00,510
It's the opera time!

5828
04:27:01,130 --> 04:27:02,070
Is this a boss?

5829
04:27:02,070 --> 04:27:03,650
I'm gonna guess it is.

5830
04:27:03,790 --> 04:27:05,690
I'm gonna guess it is.

5831
04:27:07,740 --> 04:27:09,560
The Phantom of the Opera!

5832
04:27:11,120 --> 04:27:15,200
In sleepy sang to me...

5833
04:27:15,380 --> 04:27:17,720
In dreams he came...

5834
04:27:18,580 --> 04:27:19,180
There I go!

5835
04:27:19,420 --> 04:27:20,020
Thank you for the vibe!

5836
04:27:20,160 --> 04:27:20,760
Thank you!

5837
04:27:20,980 --> 04:27:21,120
Oh!

5838
04:27:21,500 --> 04:27:22,080
V's back!

5839
04:27:32,410 --> 04:27:33,170
No!

5840
04:27:34,570 --> 04:27:34,950
No!

5841
04:27:35,410 --> 04:27:36,170
No!

5842
04:27:36,570 --> 04:27:37,270
Stinkin' way!

5843
04:27:40,890 --> 04:27:41,650
What?!

5844
04:27:42,210 --> 04:27:42,710
Angelos!

5845
04:27:42,870 --> 04:27:43,510
Oh my gosh!

5846
04:27:43,670 --> 04:27:44,770
The Angelos are multiplying!

5847
04:27:46,050 --> 04:27:46,550
Nice!

5848
04:27:46,990 --> 04:27:48,390
Getting the band back together, huh?

5849
04:27:48,510 --> 04:27:49,810
My favorite boy band!

5850
04:27:49,950 --> 04:27:50,910
What evil lurks?

5851
04:27:51,670 --> 04:27:52,030
You okay?

5852
04:27:53,150 --> 04:27:53,650
Salamandra!

5853
04:27:53,810 --> 04:27:54,910
I must destroy...

5854
04:27:54,910 --> 04:27:56,770
Thank you so much for the 20 games!

5855
04:27:56,910 --> 04:27:57,230
Thank you!

5856
04:27:58,470 --> 04:27:59,250
Thank you!

5857
04:28:00,650 --> 04:28:01,130
Angelos!

5858
04:28:01,530 --> 04:28:02,830
It's the Angelos gang!

5859
04:28:04,810 --> 04:28:06,430
Wait, are we gonna be fighting together?

5860
04:28:07,290 --> 04:28:07,770
No!

5861
04:28:08,310 --> 04:28:09,130
That's so fun!

5862
04:28:10,130 --> 04:28:10,890
Oh my gosh!

5863
04:28:11,070 --> 04:28:11,790
Wait, this is insane!

5864
04:28:12,030 --> 04:28:12,910
What is happening?!

5865
04:28:12,910 --> 04:28:13,070
What is happening?

5866
04:28:13,710 --> 04:28:15,090
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

5867
04:28:19,710 --> 04:28:19,870
Oh!

5868
04:28:20,190 --> 04:28:20,510
Oh...

5869
04:28:22,590 --> 04:28:23,110
Oh...

5870
04:28:23,110 --> 04:28:23,310
Weed!

5871
04:28:26,590 --> 04:28:27,270
Come here!

5872
04:28:34,770 --> 04:28:36,450
I'm taking it one guy at a time.

5873
04:28:47,830 --> 04:28:49,250
I'm just bullying this guy.

5874
04:28:50,850 --> 04:28:52,190
I'm really bullying him.

5875
04:28:54,070 --> 04:28:54,470
Suplex!

5876
04:28:56,910 --> 04:28:58,850
Dang, I really thought that was going to do it for him.

5877
04:28:59,710 --> 04:29:00,690
Who has left?

5878
04:29:08,310 --> 04:29:09,570
Oh, watch out, buddy!

5879
04:29:09,990 --> 04:29:11,130
Watch out, my friend!

5880
04:29:15,010 --> 04:29:16,010
A dodge rat?

5881
04:29:23,280 --> 04:29:24,800
I can't tell what's happening.

5882
04:29:25,100 --> 04:29:26,120
I'm gonna get this guy.

5883
04:29:27,820 --> 04:29:29,420
I just snuck up on him.

5884
04:29:29,780 --> 04:29:30,520
Oh, wait!

5885
04:29:30,700 --> 04:29:31,360
I just noticed!

5886
04:29:31,640 --> 04:29:32,800
I have a different...

5887
04:29:32,800 --> 04:29:34,840
I have a different... I lost my buster!

5888
04:29:35,540 --> 04:29:36,140
Noooo!

5889
04:29:41,930 --> 04:29:44,030
I'm bullying this guy, don't worry.

5890
04:29:44,310 --> 04:29:46,070
Don't worry, I'm bullying him.

5891
04:29:46,950 --> 04:29:48,150
I'm bullying him.

5892
04:29:51,010 --> 04:29:53,290
Every Angelo has their day.

5893
04:30:00,060 --> 04:30:01,360
I'm not slacking!

5894
04:30:01,540 --> 04:30:03,400
I literally got a couple guys here.

5895
04:30:12,920 --> 04:30:17,280
I'll get this guy.

5896
04:30:17,560 --> 04:30:18,400
Oh, wait.

5897
04:30:18,740 --> 04:30:19,340
I'll get him.

5898
04:30:19,560 --> 04:30:19,820
I'll get him.

5899
04:30:19,960 --> 04:30:20,380
I'll kill him.

5900
04:30:20,540 --> 04:30:20,860
Don't worry.

5901
04:30:28,490 --> 04:30:29,010
He's mine.

5902
04:30:29,210 --> 04:30:29,550
He's mine.

5903
04:30:30,890 --> 04:30:31,290
He's mine.

5904
04:30:31,290 --> 04:30:32,030
He's mine.

5905
04:30:32,230 --> 04:30:32,790
There we go.

5906
04:30:32,790 --> 04:30:32,790
He's mine.

5907
04:30:32,790 --> 04:30:32,790
There we go.

5908
04:30:33,910 --> 04:30:34,370
Okay.

5909
04:30:34,950 --> 04:30:35,750
Just one left.

5910
04:30:39,430 --> 04:30:40,110
Oh,

5911
04:30:45,530 --> 04:30:46,270
nice parry.

5912
04:30:51,590 --> 04:30:53,090
Now we jump him, yeah.

5913
04:31:04,450 --> 04:31:05,850
Jump his ass!

5914
04:31:06,270 --> 04:31:07,870
Oh my god, this guy's getting...

5915
04:31:07,870 --> 04:31:08,230
No!

5916
04:31:08,630 --> 04:31:10,070
Give me your lunch money!

5917
04:31:10,370 --> 04:31:11,770
Give me all your money!

5918
04:31:11,950 --> 04:31:13,450
Give me everything you're worth!

5919
04:31:17,190 --> 04:31:18,170
Holy cow!

5920
04:31:19,350 --> 04:31:19,610
Wait.

5921
04:31:19,890 --> 04:31:20,270
Try this.

5922
04:31:24,870 --> 04:31:25,470
Stop!

5923
04:31:25,770 --> 04:31:26,870
He's already dead!

5924
04:31:26,870 --> 04:31:27,010
Dude!

5925
04:31:27,430 --> 04:31:27,610
Hahaha!

5926
04:31:29,350 --> 04:31:29,910
Hahaha!

5927
04:31:35,390 --> 04:31:36,550
Took us long enough to get here.

5928
04:31:39,750 --> 04:31:40,310
What?

5929
04:31:40,750 --> 04:31:41,630
Tired already?

5930
04:31:42,550 --> 04:31:44,330
I just remembered something.

5931
04:31:45,650 --> 04:31:47,230
This town was attacked.

5932
04:31:48,290 --> 04:31:49,350
Once before.

5933
04:31:49,890 --> 04:31:50,690
How do you know that?

5934
04:31:50,870 --> 04:31:51,410
Set so.

5935
04:31:52,090 --> 04:31:53,190
So nano-car.

5936
04:31:55,090 --> 04:31:56,750
I can still see it.

5937
04:31:56,970 --> 04:31:58,130
What do you see, Kylo Ren?

5938
04:31:58,390 --> 04:31:59,430
What do you see?

5939
04:32:01,910 --> 04:32:03,570
Legendary jumping boss?

5940
04:32:03,930 --> 04:32:04,690
Thanks.

5941
04:32:05,150 --> 04:32:06,030
Are you being sarcastic?

5942
04:32:09,950 --> 04:32:11,470
How convenient.

5943
04:32:11,710 --> 04:32:11,710
Oh!

5944
04:32:27,470 --> 04:32:28,950
I knew he was gonna...

5945
04:32:30,990 --> 04:32:32,430
I was like, I knew he was gonna react that way.

5946
04:32:33,950 --> 04:32:35,870
Wait, does that mean we'll get our arm back?

5947
04:32:39,770 --> 04:32:40,970
Oh, please, God.

5948
04:32:42,090 --> 04:32:42,450
Please!

5949
04:32:44,750 --> 04:32:45,970
I want my arm back!

5950
04:32:46,710 --> 04:32:48,790
If we get the sword, I want my arm back!

5951
04:32:49,390 --> 04:32:50,710
I'm gonna get my body back!

5952
04:32:51,230 --> 04:32:52,650
I'm gonna get my body back!

5953
04:32:57,850 --> 04:32:58,990
Sparta is not Yamato.

5954
04:32:59,110 --> 04:33:00,230
Yeah, but it's still a sword!

5955
04:33:03,530 --> 04:33:04,710
It's still a sword!

5956
04:33:05,150 --> 04:33:06,310
Do we get a whole new body?

5957
04:33:06,470 --> 04:33:06,810
I don't know.

5958
04:33:07,210 --> 04:33:08,270
You don't like robo-arm?

5959
04:33:08,790 --> 04:33:09,550
I don't know.

5960
04:33:12,110 --> 04:33:12,890
Okay, fair.

5961
04:33:17,050 --> 04:33:18,490
Body-yaddy-yaddy, baby!

5962
04:33:20,370 --> 04:33:21,930
Guess there's no point thinking about it.

5963
04:33:28,390 --> 04:33:35,670
Un Perfect timing.

5964
04:33:36,050 --> 04:33:37,650
Now we're starting to act like a team.

5965
04:33:37,910 --> 04:33:38,330
Ew.

5966
04:33:38,810 --> 04:33:39,950
You guys flirting with me?

5967
04:33:40,470 --> 04:33:41,470
Knock it off.

5968
04:33:42,090 --> 04:33:42,890
Get in the car.

5969
04:33:42,890 --> 04:33:44,770
My man is happily taken.

5970
04:33:52,410 --> 04:33:53,330
She's fine.

5971
04:33:54,030 --> 04:33:55,190
I love Nico.

5972
04:33:55,390 --> 04:33:56,110
She's so silly.

5973
04:33:56,830 --> 04:33:58,150
I love Nico.

5974
04:33:58,610 --> 04:33:59,710
She wants us.

5975
04:34:00,210 --> 04:34:01,590
I don't know about that.

5976
04:34:02,990 --> 04:34:04,570
I don't know about that.

5977
04:34:05,550 --> 04:34:07,430
Oh, lady's got a shirt on now.

5978
04:34:07,850 --> 04:34:08,090
No!

5979
04:34:10,630 --> 04:34:11,750
Demon King.

5980
04:34:11,930 --> 04:34:13,370
That sounds pretty intense, no?

5981
04:34:15,350 --> 04:34:18,170
That sounds pretty... Hmm.

5982
04:34:18,890 --> 04:34:20,050
Pretty crazy, no?

5983
04:34:31,840 --> 04:34:32,700
Mod the game.

5984
04:34:32,820 --> 04:34:33,660
Make her shirtless again.

5985
04:34:38,050 --> 04:34:41,030
Trying to decide if I want to do another mission or not.

5986
04:34:43,490 --> 04:34:45,110
Mission 8 will be really long.

5987
04:34:46,510 --> 04:34:47,890
Maybe I'll call it here.

5988
04:34:49,150 --> 04:34:51,390
I'm not trying to rush through the game or anything, so.

5989
04:34:52,190 --> 04:34:57,550
I just wanted to play more today because I only played for so little last time.

5990
04:34:57,790 --> 04:34:58,950
So I just wanted to make up for it.

5991
04:34:59,030 --> 04:35:00,510
But we got through...

5992
04:35:00,510 --> 04:35:03,510
You know, we had 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

5993
04:35:03,510 --> 04:35:04,950
That's 5 missions, baby.

5994
04:35:06,350 --> 04:35:07,750
We got through 5 whole missions.

5995
04:35:12,950 --> 04:35:13,790
Yeah, so...

5996
04:35:15,330 --> 04:35:16,170
Good progress.

5997
04:35:16,430 --> 04:35:17,070
Good progress.

5998
04:35:17,610 --> 04:35:18,470
Yeah, yeah.

5999
04:35:19,530 --> 04:35:19,590
Yeah, yeah.

6000
04:35:19,890 --> 04:35:20,410
So...

6001
04:35:20,990 --> 04:35:21,510
Probably...

6002
04:35:22,510 --> 04:35:24,070
Two more streams, maybe.

6003
04:35:25,370 --> 04:35:25,890
Depending.

6004
04:35:26,590 --> 04:35:27,710
How good I am.

6005
04:35:29,870 --> 04:35:30,590
We'll see.

6006
04:35:32,430 --> 04:35:32,950
Yeah.

6007
04:35:33,630 --> 04:35:34,550
Thanks for streaming, Minto.

6008
04:35:34,950 --> 04:35:36,190
You need to rest for your healthy.

6009
04:35:36,350 --> 04:35:36,810
Thank you!

6010
04:35:36,810 --> 04:35:37,690
Yeah.

6011
04:35:38,630 --> 04:35:39,050
I...

6012
04:35:39,050 --> 04:35:39,650
I...

6013
04:35:39,650 --> 04:35:40,310
It's...

6014
04:35:40,310 --> 04:35:40,630
It's...

6015
04:35:40,630 --> 04:35:44,210
I'm in such a rock and a hard place because I'm like, I want to stream long, long.

6016
04:35:44,430 --> 04:35:44,870
But...

6017
04:35:44,870 --> 04:35:46,890
I try to not stream long, long.

6018
04:35:47,130 --> 04:35:48,070
Because I...

6019
04:35:48,070 --> 04:35:48,790
Don't want...

6020
04:35:48,790 --> 04:35:50,650
I need to rest on my throat, too.

6021
04:35:53,290 --> 04:35:53,770
So...

6022
04:35:54,470 --> 04:35:54,950
Nah...

6023
04:35:54,950 --> 04:35:55,950
You know.

6024
04:35:58,090 --> 04:35:59,430
But today I'm feeling good.

6025
04:35:59,650 --> 04:36:00,950
Today I am feeling quite good.

6026
04:36:01,810 --> 04:36:02,290
Um...

6027
04:36:02,290 --> 04:36:02,910
So...

6028
04:36:02,910 --> 04:36:03,610
I think...

6029
04:36:03,610 --> 04:36:05,350
I think, uh...

6030
04:36:05,350 --> 04:36:06,110
Uh...

6031
04:36:06,110 --> 04:36:07,510
In terms of the medicine, I'm...

6032
04:36:07,510 --> 04:36:10,870
I'm feeling much better from it, so...

6033
04:36:10,870 --> 04:36:11,250
Mm-hmm.

6034
04:36:11,410 --> 04:36:12,770
Thank you guys for your patience.

6035
04:36:13,110 --> 04:36:14,410
With me...

6036
04:36:15,090 --> 04:36:15,570
Uh...

6037
04:36:15,570 --> 04:36:16,730
With me...

6038
04:36:16,730 --> 04:36:17,270
Uh...

6039
04:36:17,270 --> 04:36:18,010
Getting through it.

6040
04:36:20,110 --> 04:36:20,810
So, yeah.

6041
04:36:20,870 --> 04:36:21,690
I appreciate it.

6042
04:36:21,910 --> 04:36:22,270
Mm-hmm.

6043
04:36:23,990 --> 04:36:25,370
Thank you for the fun stream!

6044
04:36:26,090 --> 04:36:26,670
Thank you!

6045
04:36:26,670 --> 04:36:32,350
Your willingness to hold Doki's hand through the meandering hella visage speaks louder than any compliment.

6046
04:36:32,890 --> 04:36:35,230
Which we'll be finishing this week as well.

6047
04:36:35,530 --> 04:36:36,010
And...

6048
04:36:36,010 --> 04:36:36,910
Uh...

6049
04:36:36,910 --> 04:36:37,550
Before...

6050
04:36:37,550 --> 04:36:38,030
Before...

6051
04:36:38,030 --> 04:36:40,510
Before we end off today, I have a cover...

6052
04:36:40,510 --> 04:36:41,650
Coming out...

6053
04:36:42,390 --> 04:36:43,030
On...

6054
04:36:43,710 --> 04:36:44,350
Tuesday.

6055
04:36:46,850 --> 04:36:48,130
April 29th.

6056
04:36:48,290 --> 04:36:49,670
Or April 30th.

6057
04:36:49,750 --> 04:36:51,450
Depending on your...

6058
04:36:51,450 --> 04:36:52,170
Time zone.

6059
04:36:52,370 --> 04:36:53,470
I wanted it to be...

6060
04:36:53,470 --> 04:36:55,010
I wanted it to be...

6061
04:36:55,010 --> 04:36:55,790
A...

6062
04:36:56,370 --> 04:36:56,930
Uh...

6063
04:36:56,930 --> 04:36:57,050
Uh...

6064
04:36:57,050 --> 04:37:01,270
So, basically, it's a song from Metal Gear, which is...

6065
04:37:01,270 --> 04:37:02,710
You know, everybody covers...

6066
04:37:02,710 --> 04:37:04,130
And everybody sings in karaoke.

6067
04:37:04,130 --> 04:37:05,710
They all sing Snake Eater.

6068
04:37:05,910 --> 04:37:06,710
But I...

6069
04:37:06,710 --> 04:37:08,850
This is actually probably my favorite...

6070
04:37:09,750 --> 04:37:11,790
Metal Gear song in the whole...

6071
04:37:12,390 --> 04:37:12,830
Series.

6072
04:37:12,890 --> 04:37:13,810
I'm not gonna lie.

6073
04:37:13,810 --> 04:37:15,050
I love this song.

6074
04:37:15,370 --> 04:37:16,090
And so...

6075
04:37:16,090 --> 04:37:16,950
I wanted it...

6076
04:37:16,950 --> 04:37:17,870
In the games...

6077
04:37:17,870 --> 04:37:20,630
The games take place on April 29th and 30th.

6078
04:37:20,730 --> 04:37:22,150
So I wanted it to kind of...

6079
04:37:22,150 --> 04:37:23,530
Depending on your time zone.

6080
04:37:23,550 --> 04:37:25,710
It's either April 29th or 30th.

6081
04:37:25,710 --> 04:37:26,510
So...

6082
04:37:26,510 --> 04:37:28,170
It's relevant in both...

6083
04:37:28,850 --> 04:37:29,350
Times.

6084
04:37:30,410 --> 04:37:31,370
I'm a genius.

6085
04:37:33,850 --> 04:37:34,950
I'm a genius.

6086
04:37:36,670 --> 04:37:38,570
But I really like this song.

6087
04:37:39,130 --> 04:37:39,790
So...

6088
04:37:39,790 --> 04:37:40,150
Um...

6089
04:37:40,150 --> 04:37:40,310
Yeah.

6090
04:37:40,510 --> 04:37:42,810
You don't have to like Metal Gear to like this song either.

6091
04:37:43,270 --> 04:37:43,610
It's...

6092
04:37:43,610 --> 04:37:44,590
It's just a...

6093
04:37:44,590 --> 04:37:45,330
Nice little...

6094
04:37:46,010 --> 04:37:47,370
Nice little...

6095
04:37:47,370 --> 04:37:48,270
Jazzy song.

6096
04:37:51,470 --> 04:37:52,630
Mint, you're a genius.

6097
04:37:52,910 --> 04:37:53,410
Thank you.

6098
04:37:54,870 --> 04:37:56,510
Don't skip the sacks this time.

6099
04:37:56,690 --> 04:37:57,510
Oh, there's no skipping.

6100
04:37:58,190 --> 04:37:58,390
Nope.

6101
04:38:00,190 --> 04:38:01,070
No skipping.

6102
04:38:01,490 --> 04:38:01,930
So...

6103
04:38:01,930 --> 04:38:02,330
Um...

6104
04:38:02,330 --> 04:38:03,030
That's my...

6105
04:38:03,030 --> 04:38:04,330
That's my advertisement.

6106
04:38:05,830 --> 04:38:06,770
For today.

6107
04:38:07,790 --> 04:38:08,070
Yeah.

6108
04:38:10,610 --> 04:38:13,130
Thank you guys for helping me again.

6109
04:38:13,770 --> 04:38:16,750
Especially figuring out the moves and stuff.

6110
04:38:16,970 --> 04:38:20,950
Sorry if I learn something in the void and then I completely forget to use it.

6111
04:38:21,530 --> 04:38:21,830
But...

6112
04:38:23,590 --> 04:38:24,910
But, you know...

6113
04:38:24,910 --> 04:38:27,170
I'm a panic mode in...

6114
04:38:27,170 --> 04:38:27,530
In battle.

6115
04:38:28,390 --> 04:38:28,910
But...

6116
04:38:29,670 --> 04:38:30,830
Love the turrets though.

6117
04:38:30,930 --> 04:38:32,450
I mean, I do love love the turrets.

6118
04:38:32,670 --> 04:38:34,930
I love all the songs in Metal Gear.

6119
04:38:35,350 --> 04:38:36,450
They're all really good.

6120
04:38:36,590 --> 04:38:37,330
Can't wait to hear it.

6121
04:38:37,430 --> 04:38:37,950
Thank you.

6122
04:38:38,470 --> 04:38:38,990
I...

6123
04:38:38,990 --> 04:38:39,370
I...

6124
04:38:39,370 --> 04:38:41,490
I put it together really, really quickly.

6125
04:38:41,510 --> 04:38:42,650
Because I was just like...

6126
04:38:42,650 --> 04:38:43,530
I was thinking.

6127
04:38:43,690 --> 04:38:44,270
I was like, oh no.

6128
04:38:44,610 --> 04:38:47,130
I don't have anything for April 30th this year.

6129
04:38:48,630 --> 04:38:49,150
Um...

6130
04:38:49,150 --> 04:38:50,030
Because, you know...

6131
04:38:50,030 --> 04:38:51,570
I'm not playing Metal Gear.

6132
04:38:51,570 --> 04:38:52,330
Solid 2.

6133
04:38:52,750 --> 04:38:53,210
And...

6134
04:38:53,210 --> 04:38:55,710
I already did the...

6135
04:38:55,710 --> 04:38:57,530
The skateboard game last year.

6136
04:38:57,710 --> 04:38:58,750
So I was like, what can I do?

6137
04:38:58,950 --> 04:39:00,550
And then I was like, wait, I can...

6138
04:39:01,510 --> 04:39:02,150
There's a...

6139
04:39:02,150 --> 04:39:03,370
There's a big spider!

6140
04:39:04,570 --> 04:39:05,130
Hold on.

6141
04:39:05,130 --> 04:39:05,970
I'm taking a picture of him.

6142
04:39:08,850 --> 04:39:09,830
Oh my god.

6143
04:39:11,590 --> 04:39:12,470
Oh my god!

6144
04:39:15,190 --> 04:39:17,230
I think that's the spider I saw before.

6145
04:39:17,230 --> 04:39:18,210
But he's even bigger!

6146
04:39:20,050 --> 04:39:20,930
There he goes.

6147
04:39:21,510 --> 04:39:21,970
Bye!

6148
04:39:22,350 --> 04:39:22,970
Where are you going?

6149
04:39:23,410 --> 04:39:24,190
Where are you going?

6150
04:39:24,430 --> 04:39:25,410
Where are you going?

6151
04:39:26,030 --> 04:39:27,110
Where are you going?

6152
04:39:28,330 --> 04:39:29,370
Where are you going?

6153
04:39:30,130 --> 04:39:31,390
He's climbing up!

6154
04:39:31,730 --> 04:39:32,710
Oh my god!

6155
04:39:33,450 --> 04:39:34,350
He's freaking out.

6156
04:39:34,590 --> 04:39:35,390
Why are you freaking out?

6157
04:39:35,510 --> 04:39:36,450
Is it because I'm freaking out?

6158
04:39:36,710 --> 04:39:37,530
Don't freak out.

6159
04:39:37,690 --> 04:39:38,230
Don't freak out.

6160
04:39:38,490 --> 04:39:39,310
Please don't freak out.

6161
04:39:43,220 --> 04:39:44,340
He's so big!

6162
04:39:44,560 --> 04:39:45,720
He's really big!

6163
04:39:47,400 --> 04:39:48,880
He's all the way to the ceiling!

6164
04:39:52,600 --> 04:39:54,220
He went on a training arc.

6165
04:39:55,820 --> 04:39:58,040
Okay, I'm gonna... What was I saying?

6166
04:39:58,120 --> 04:39:58,840
What was my story?

6167
04:40:01,800 --> 04:40:02,740
What was my story?

6168
04:40:11,160 --> 04:40:11,780
The cover?

6169
04:40:11,940 --> 04:40:12,420
Oh, yeah.

6170
04:40:12,620 --> 04:40:15,160
I came... I was like, Raid of Spiders.

6171
04:40:15,300 --> 04:40:16,400
No, I was not like that.

6172
04:40:16,620 --> 04:40:20,960
I did... I did... I'm not playing MGS2 and I did the skateboarding game already.

6173
04:40:21,100 --> 04:40:22,300
Sorry, I'm monitoring him.

6174
04:40:22,580 --> 04:40:24,720
I don't want him to go into my mid outfit.

6175
04:40:26,980 --> 04:40:27,340
Um...

6176
04:40:27,340 --> 04:40:30,600
And so I was like, what can I do for April 30th?

6177
04:40:30,660 --> 04:40:33,220
And then I was like, wait, I can do a cover of Can't Say Goodbye to Yesterday.

6178
04:40:34,900 --> 04:40:35,940
And... Oh, my God.

6179
04:40:36,060 --> 04:40:37,840
Now he's on the... Oh, my God.

6180
04:40:37,880 --> 04:40:39,280
Now he's on the ceiling ceiling.

6181
04:40:39,760 --> 04:40:40,900
Oh, my God.

6182
04:40:40,900 --> 04:40:42,860
If he falls... Don't fall.

6183
04:40:43,040 --> 04:40:43,560
Please don't fall.

6184
04:40:43,940 --> 04:40:47,360
So I came up with this idea probably, like, a week and a half ago.

6185
04:40:47,580 --> 04:40:54,680
And everybody... The mixer and the artist I pulled together, I was just like, Can you, like, rush this so fast?

6186
04:40:54,680 --> 04:40:55,640
And they were like, yeah.

6187
04:40:56,060 --> 04:40:57,900
And so it was awesome.

6188
04:40:58,260 --> 04:40:59,760
Charge that spider rent.

6189
04:40:59,960 --> 04:41:00,560
I wish.

6190
04:41:04,440 --> 04:41:04,920
Flamethrower?

6191
04:41:05,180 --> 04:41:05,700
Yeah, maybe.

6192
04:41:07,020 --> 04:41:08,960
I wish I had a devil arm right now.

6193
04:41:08,960 --> 04:41:11,800
So I could grabby grab them and then squash.

6194
04:41:12,400 --> 04:41:12,840
No!

6195
04:41:13,560 --> 04:41:15,620
Please, video games, become your life!

6196
04:41:18,240 --> 04:41:19,580
Press square to shoot it.

6197
04:41:24,030 --> 04:41:24,670
But, yeah.

6198
04:41:25,090 --> 04:41:26,630
So, yeah.

6199
04:41:26,630 --> 04:41:28,850
I came up with the idea pretty quickly.

6200
04:41:29,110 --> 04:41:30,850
So, sorry if I don't sound so great in it.

6201
04:41:30,950 --> 04:41:32,750
Because my voice has not been so great lately.

6202
04:41:32,750 --> 04:41:34,450
But, um...

6203
04:41:35,570 --> 04:41:38,350
And I made the video pretty quickly, too.

6204
04:41:40,310 --> 04:41:40,990
Go, kitty.

6205
04:41:41,150 --> 04:41:41,370
Go.

6206
04:41:41,570 --> 04:41:41,930
Pause.

6207
04:41:42,530 --> 04:41:44,030
Save Mito from spider.

6208
04:41:44,310 --> 04:41:45,050
She's not in here.

6209
04:41:45,130 --> 04:41:45,430
Oh, my gosh.

6210
04:41:45,570 --> 04:41:46,110
Please don't fall.

6211
04:41:46,290 --> 04:41:46,890
Please don't fall.

6212
04:41:47,050 --> 04:41:47,510
Oh, my God.

6213
04:41:47,530 --> 04:41:48,410
He's coming towards me.

6214
04:41:48,650 --> 04:41:48,890
Okay.

6215
04:41:48,970 --> 04:41:49,450
I gotta go.

6216
04:41:49,630 --> 04:41:50,710
I gotta go and take care of this.

6217
04:41:51,030 --> 04:41:51,950
