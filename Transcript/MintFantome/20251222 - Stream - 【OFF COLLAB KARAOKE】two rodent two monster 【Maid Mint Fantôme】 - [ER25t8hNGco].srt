00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,510
I hope you guys know who I am.

61
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,490
Maybe don't.

62
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,790
I'm a phantom.

63
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,670
You haven't heard.

64
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,390
Yeah.

65
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,910
A lot of people don't know me.

66
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,010
I introduced myself to someone tonight and he didn't know
who I was.

67
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,170
So I was like, wow.

68
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,850
And you're meet and greet today?

69
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,390
No.

70
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,630
Oh, actually there were some people that came and they were
like, I've never watched any of you at all.

71
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,210
I like how people do that and they're like, all right, give
me the elevator pitch.

72
00:05:57,370 --> 00:05:59,650
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

73
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,410
You're going to have to set aside 30 minutes for this to go.

74
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:03,910
I know.

75
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,950
First we got to start with there's this thing on YouTube
called The Annoying Orange.

76
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,410
We're going, it's like, Do you have to give a whole history
to elevator pitch?

77
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:14,950
Yeah.

78
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,090
Wait, okay, elevator pitch isn't.

79
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,750
Wait, no!

80
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,550
No, you're just as bad as that.

81
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,550
Ashton, I'm new to VTubers.

82
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,210
Can you explain why I should watch you?

83
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,370
You fucking...

84
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,570
Do you like cars?

85
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:29,990
Do you like cars?

86
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,470
Why are you putting me on the hotspot, man?

87

88
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,110
What's your favorite car?

94
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:48,810
Because, I'm turning the audience.

95

146
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,250

148
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,790

a static image i'm used to like i know like wiggling around

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:41,890
Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,770

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,030
Oh, yeah, you're right.

239
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,470
Wait, let's all sit on the ground.

240
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:50,270
Should I do?

241
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,530
Like a little table?

242
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,190
I can't tackle anybody on the ground.

243
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,910
Somebody at some point is gonna have to sit on the bed so I
can start tackling people.

244
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:57,870
Oh my God.

245
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,950
I'm gonna have like rodent on rodent violence.

246
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,270
Yeah.

247
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:01,750
Rodent on the bed.

248
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,970
Wait, wait, wait, let's do it.

249
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,510
I didn't tell me to get on the bed.

250
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:05,710
Get on the bed.

251
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

252
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,090

00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,110
Oh my god.

256
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,850
She's like, what, Ashton?

257
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,550
She's like, actually doing wrestling.

258
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,090
Oh my god, Ashton is currently on top of Nimimiani and is...

259
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,690
Oh my god.

260
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,810
I don't know if I've ever liked that.

261
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,100
What's happening?

262
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,980
Barry, just a double, triple team nerd.

263
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,400
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

264
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,900
What do you guys get out?

265
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:38,080
Oh my god, wait, why are we standing up?

266
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,540
Why are we standing up?

267
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,020
She's gonna soup like that.

268
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,720
Get German soup like that.

269
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,320
Oh my god, we're like a real girl supper party.

270
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,620
I'm gonna get a noise complaint.

271
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,540
I was actually just thinking about that.

272
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,640
Okay, let's calm down.

273
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,520
Yeah, we're calm, we're chill, we're calm, we're cool.

274
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,980
We're gonna sing Hellfire.

275
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,580
Does everyone know Hellfire?

276
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,900
I only want to do songs we all know.

277
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,000
I worry that I don't know it well enough, actually.

278
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,700
Okay, um, it's low Let's what's another fun Disney song.

279
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,640
I tried to get it.

280
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,500
I was like, this is too low.

281
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:23,260

Oh, yeah, yeah, yes, yes.

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,580
Gaston who said who said that in chat?

286
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,600

Okay, we're singing it in French.

291
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,460
Okay, sounds good.

292
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,020
I can't do this.

293
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Is this the freaking recent?

294
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,860
No, no, this is...

295
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,180
I don't know the beginning.

296
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,480
How's that?

297
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm trying to

298
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,890
like- That guy's not that one.

299
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,850
I don't think it's that far.

300
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,510
I don't think it's that far.

301
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:28,230
It's not that far.

302
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,210
I'm gonna do that far.

303
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,110
I got Mimi.

304
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,110
I got Barry.

305
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,150
I got my eye.

306
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,030
What?

307
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,650
What are we doing?

308
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,470
We're gonna get suplexed later.

309
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,510
You only suplex me.

310
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,610
You did suplex Barry?

311
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,110
I don't- Well, she turned in the fight.

312
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,910
I'm just saying that like- Yeah, I- I was not- Why did you
guys like double see you?

313
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,750
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

314
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,810
We're almost there, we're almost there.

315
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,330
Sorry guys, is it still loud?

316
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,350
I think it might be loud.

317
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,630
No one!

318
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:58,590
No one!

319
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,330
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

320
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:02,170
No one, think about it.

321
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:04,770
I guess not.

322
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,830
I guess not.

323
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,150
I guess not.

324
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,530
Perfect if you're fair again.

325
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,310
Come to your family.

326
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,390
And they'll tell you whose teammate preferred it.

327
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,390
be us.

328
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:22,070
Oh, what the hell?

329
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,770
Spin like a star.

330
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,410
How can't be like a star?

331
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:29,070
No one's gotta smell clean like a star like a star.

332
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,050
There's a specimen.

333
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:30,970
Yeah, yeah, it doesn't.

334
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,610
I wanna die like a star.

335
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,230
It turns out we don't know the song.

336
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:39,910
Guess what?

337
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:40,930
What do we know?

338
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,850
All the rest is on...

339
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:43,550
DRIPS!

340
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:44,950
No.

341
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:54,290
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Ashton.

342
00:17:54,510 --> 00:18:00,310
Why did she chop at me?

343
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:01,850
Oh my god.

344
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,630
Every inch of me is covered with hair.

345
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:14,170
No one hits nobody's face like Ashton.

346
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,150
Ashton!

347
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,130
Katie, patooie, patooie!

348
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:27,290
When I was a lad, I ate four dozen eggs every morning to
help me get large.

349
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:36,030
And now that I'm grown, I eat five dozen eggs, so I'm
roughly the size of a barge.

350
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,930
That was good.

351
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,990
She's really good.

352
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,990
Wow, it's really good.

353
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,630
We didn't even sing half the song.

354
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:56,970
I know.

355
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,630
I'm super successful.

356
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,690
Oh my god, everyone.

357
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,850
It's so loud.

358
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,730
It's so loud.

359
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,410
Is that better, guys?

360
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,690
I know it's still loud, Ty.

361
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,030
And his name's T-A-S-T.

362
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,410
G-A-S-T-E.

363
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,370
This is me trying to spell your name earlier, Ashley.

364
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,070

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,030
Ashton Byton.

366
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,910
Ah-Ton Byton.

367
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,390
Make a man out of you.

368
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,110
That's what it's called?

369
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,850
I mean, right?

370
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:35,930
Yeah, I think so.

Make a mouse out of you.

375
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,410
Make a mouse out of you.

376
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,110
Make a mouse out of you.

377
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,130
Johnny Osmond.

378
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,670
Yeah, that's what we're going to do to you guys.

379
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,790
Wait, hello?

380
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:49,730
Wait, what?

381
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,150
What does that mean?

382
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,070
That's all we're gonna do to you guys.

383
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,910
What does that mean?

384
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,050
I can't say.

385
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,140
Don't turn it to Sue.

386
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,220
I didn't have to say it yet.

387
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,540
Wait, I'm chasing it.

388
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,560
No, we know this one.

389
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,620
Let's get down to business to defeat Ashdod.

390
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,580
He said it every time.

391
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,800
He said it every time.

392
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,160
Why?

393
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,680
You're so sad.

394
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,860
You're the saddest bunch I ever met.

395
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,660
But you can bet before we're through.

396
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Mr. Howe, make a man out of you.

397
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,400
It's so low.

398
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:46,620
Crancliffe has a forest, but a fire with it.

399
00:20:49,700 --> 00:21:05,700

couple This guy's got us scared to death!

402
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,600
Hope he doesn't save my Toby!

403
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,020
I really wish that I knew how to swim.

404
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:40,880
The ocean must be swift as the coursing river With all the
strength of a great typhoon With all the strength of a

405
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:49,760
raging fire Mysterious and the dark side of the moon I'm
like a puberty What?

406
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,660
I'm going to puberty, I'm cracking.

407
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,940
Do you need water?

408
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:55,820
Maybe.

409
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,940
Yeah, there's water right there.

410
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,320
All righty.

411
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,600
Wait, I don't know.

412
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:06,440
You need my every order and you might survive.

413
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,240
Go.

414
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,680
You're unsuited for the rage of war.

415
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,980
So pack up, go home.

416
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,660
You're through.

417
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,080
How could I make a man?

418
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,380
and out of you.

419
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,200
And then someone has to climb the pole.

420
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,140
You.

421
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,040
Oh, okay.

422
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,380
I was gonna go.

423
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:29,540
This is good.

424
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm very sorry.

425
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,720
I'm sorry.

426
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,080
I'm going to go.

427
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,140
I'm on HR.

428
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:39,960
I'm on HR.

429
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,520
The Arceus has the archival.

430
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,280
I know.

431
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,540
The moon.

432
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,620
I know.

433
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:45,900
I know.

434
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:46,820
I know.

435
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,260
I must be with the circle.

436
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,220
I know.

437
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,780
We are mad, it's all the force of a great typhoon.

438
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,340
We are mad, it's all the strength of a raging fire.

439
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,440
And that is our side of the moon!

440
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,280
Okay, now that we got a group song done, we can do solos.

441
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,300
Why are you saying, oh my god?

442
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,640
Is Mitara singing in chat?

443
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,700
I don't know.

444
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,520
I think she is.

445
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,360
I think she's like...

446
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
typing out the lyrics in chat.

447
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,580
Yeah, Matara!

448
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,600
Matara's solo, let's go!

449
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,280
Matara!

450
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,180
She has to sing the Megara song.

451
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,160
Lips of a... what?

452
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,720
Angel.

453
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,560
Lips of an angel.

454
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,960
No, like a Hercules, the...

455
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,060
Wait, that's a good one too.

456
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah, for Matara's voice too.

457
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:37,580
Which one?

458
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,380
Like because the raspy, like the Meg thing.

459
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,380
Oh, I love that song!

460
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,260
Wait, yeah.

461
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,380
It could be like the muses.

462
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,720
Oh, she's a...

463
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,460
Oh, she's a...

464
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,740
Yeah!

465
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,760
That's perfect for you.

466
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,820
Do you mean Ursula?

467
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:52,320
No!

468
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,980
Oh my god!

469
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,100
Actually, what song does Ursula sing?

470
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,360
I tried singing that one on karaoke when I did it on
Thursday, but like, they don't give you the muses, so you

471
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,500
have to like rush to do both of them.

472
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,540
They do in this, Caravan.

473
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,340
Oh, do they!

474
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
Yeah, this app is crazy.

475
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,260
No, I don't want to walk in.

476
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:07,960
Yes!

477
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,740
Oh my goodness.

478
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,300
Don't knock down everything.

479
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,340
My throat hurts, man.

480
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,400
I know, me too.

481
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,220
You want some cough stuff?

482
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:15,860
It's actually over.

483
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,200
We're all getting sick after this.

484
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:17,520
Huh?

485
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,240
I don't think we're sick.

486
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,240
We've just been yelling and screaming.

487
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,040
That's very true, that's very true, that's very true.

488
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,560
We're all like, just like the stupidest shit, I'm like
accidentally rage baiting the group because I'm saying

489
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,720
stupid shit.

490
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,720
Oh my god.

491
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,960
There's like Barry saying, oh thank you, love is an open
door.

492
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,100
Oh yeah, alone.

493
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,880
Okay, okay.

494
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,440
But no one sings Hansparks.

495
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,500
That's what I did on stream, like it was just like dead
silent.

496
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,420
Okay, we'll do that, no one sings Hansparks.

497
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,140
What the hell?

498
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:54,760

503
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:28,820
I was thinking the same thing because like, I've been
searching my whole life to find my own place.

504
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,400
And maybe it's the party talking.

505
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,260
Oh, I don't know this.

506
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,860
Or the chocolate fondue.

507
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,100
Come with you.

508
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,280
With you.

509
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,080
I found my place.

510
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,060
I see your face.

511
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,740
And it's nothing like I've ever known before.

512
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,200
Love is an open car.

513
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,360
Love is an open car.

514
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,100
Door!

515
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,020

Loves an open door!

519
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,600
And then we start making out.

520
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:03,700

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,620
Not almond doll.

537
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,400
Or...

538
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,280
Or...

539
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,460
I'm so sorry.

540
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,200
No, why do you do this alone?

541
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,400
I was gonna help you!

542
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,120
You're being so mean.

543
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,620
I'm sorry.

544
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,480
If we get a noise complaint, I'll just show myself out.

545
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,720
I gotta go, y'all.

546
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,020
Guys, I gotta go.

547
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:20,560
Man, earlier we were in Uber together, Barry, and like, me
and Mimi were like, ah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

548
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,260
and you were like, Yeah, like, oh, I don't know about that
either.

549
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,960
He was like, oh my God.

550
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,140
I have a naturally loud voice.

551
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,040
No, I didn't notice while we were Ubering, while we were
Ubering, like you guys were in the backseat together and I

552
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,140
was in the front seat, right?

553
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,200
Because it was a smaller car.

554
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,000
And I was like, I can't hear these bitches.

555
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,340
And I were like, I was just like, what?

556
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,820
You're like, oh, I like your socks.

557
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,900
Oh, Miffy.

558
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:53,940
My Miffy socks.

559
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:54,680
Miffy.

560
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,720
When I went to Japan for the first time, I realized like how
many, like the endless possibility of showing socks.

561
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:00,420
I know.

562
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,060
I'm replacing every pair of my socks.

563
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,440
Yeah.

564
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,020
So these are all like, I have like seven Miffy pairs.

565
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,140
I love Miffy.

566
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,520
Tamagotchi pairs.

567
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:10,180
Did you see my Miffy bag in my bathroom?

568
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,940
I think I did.

569
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,800
It was cute.

570
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,120
Yeah.

571
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,580
Oh, did you ever find the Miffy bag you were looking for?

572
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,160
I did.

573
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:15,760
Ooh.

574
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,760
I think I did.

575
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,480
But okay, it has like this terrible part on the back that I
don't like.

576
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,780
that I didn't see.

577
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,300
Did it say something stupid in English?

578
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:23,860
No.

579
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,780
I don't want to say it because it's like really obvious, so.

580
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,820
Oh, no.

581
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,820
Yeah.

582
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,500
I don't know, guys.

583
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:30,980
I don't know.

584
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,320
OK.

585
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,120
OK, now you guys do it.

586
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,860
Yes, yes, yes.

587
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:34,920
Loathing.

588
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,920
This is going to be like so much more put together.

589
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,380
Can I like show ourselves?

590
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:41,060
Yeah, they're going to, because they're like so serious
about this.

591
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,600
I know.

592
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,320
Wait, no.

593
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,880
Why don't you just paint yourselves green and pink, man?

594
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,540
I know.

595
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,540
Don't piss me off.

596
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,500
It's all in good fun.

597
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:47,880
It's all in good fun.

598
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,480
You're pink.

599
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,140
Oh, whatever.

600
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,680
you're pink.

601
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,540
I'll do Glinda, okay.

602
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

603
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:53,760
Okay.

604
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,140
Where is it though?

605
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,600
Yes.

606
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,580
Did you hear that?

607
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,560
Guys, she's green.

608
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,380
Not me.

609
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,320
I'm blonde.

610
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,440
I'm literally blonde.

611
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,640
What are you saying to them?

612
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,860
Don't believe the lies.

613
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,000
Don't believe that my pit crew will tell you I'm
green-haired, but I don't have green hair.

614
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,520
I'm blonde.

615
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,120
Action!

616
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:16,830
Oh, your body.

617
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,570
I can have my pink and purple on my...

618
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,370
colors.

619
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,630
Wait, restart it, restart it.

620
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:27,330
I'll restart.

621
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,470
Oh, it's okay, okay, okay.

622
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,490
But of course I'll rise above it.

623
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,410
I don't know this part.

624
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:36,050
For I know that's how you'd want me to respond.

625
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:44,650
There's been so confusion for you to see my roommate is.

626
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:52,610
Unusually and exceedingly peculiar and altogether quite
impossible to do.

627
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:54,470
describe

628
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:10,890
Chinchilla Now do you guys do the choreography What is this

Oh, I do admit it came on fast Still, I do believe that it
can last And I will be loading, loading you my whole life.

634
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:17,290
I just can't go into you, I just do your good.

635
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:17,890
Never.

636
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,230
I do you, Shannon.

637
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,710
I don't think I could.

638
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,510
She's no Sarah, she's a starter.

639
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,210
We don't mean to show a bias.

640
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,990
But Galinda, you're a martyr.

641
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:32,890
Well, these things are sent to try us.

642
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:33,810
Oh, okay.

643
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,750
What the hell is walking now?

644
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:36,470
I know.

645
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,310
I know, what the hell?

646
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:41,810
Oh.

647
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:52,470
For Galinda, forced to reside with someone so disgusted if I
just want to tell you we're all on your side.

648
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,350
We share your love.

649
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,410
What is this feeling?

650
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,850
So sudden and new.

651
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,770
About the moment I laid eyes on you.

652
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,870
My pulse is rushing.

653
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,530
My head is reeling.

654
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,030
We love it all.

655
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,970
Oh, what is this feeling?

656
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:12,230
Does it have a name?

657
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,750
Yes.

658
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,310
Loading.

659
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,630
There's a strange exhilaration.

660
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:22,510
Loading.

661
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,510
Total devastation!

662
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,150
Loading!

663
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,430
It's so pure and so strong!

664
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,070
Oh, I do admit it came on fast!

665
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,150
Still, I do believe that it can last!

666
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:43,530
And I will be loading more, forever loading, Truly, deeply
loading!

667
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,090
You!

668
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:50,170
My whole life long!

669
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,890
I'm happy to do this.

670
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:55,830
Boo!

671
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,380
Yay!

672
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,080
Did you hit your head on the table?

673
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,040
Did I?

674
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,580
I don't know.

675
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,120
I saw you like a little bit like.

676
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,740
I don't think so.

677
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,180
Okay, maybe I would have felt it.

678
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,540
Maybe I phased through it.

679
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,760
You're too focused on the song.

680
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,520
We're all under the maid cafe table now.

681
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,200
We're all under the maid cafe.

682
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,800
Yeah, we're all under the table.

683
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,900
Yeah, we're all under the maid cafe table.

684
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,220
We're on the floor, you guys.

685
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,180
This is kind of like humiliating.

686
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,560
Because...

687
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,960
Because, like, I make much weird faces.

688
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,580
I like, I like, oopalupa.

689
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,880
Me too, I've always like.

690
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,040
It's so awesome.

691
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,800
The audience doesn't see this.

692
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,220
We're, like, we have primetime view.

693
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,960
You can sing that one.

694
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
I would love that.

695
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,440
I don't know that song.

696
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,180
I don't know the whole thing.

697
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:42,680
Oopalupadupadidu?

698
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,960
I think it's just noises.

699
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,480
Is it not?

700
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,180
Yeah, it might be.

701
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:49,400
No, because they're also like, what do you get when you go
in chocolate?

702
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:49,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

703
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,800
You get sucked up because then you will die.

704
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,160
What?

706
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:56,280
the movie?

707
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,200
No, I think it's like, oh, no, the oopalupas show up when
somebody dies.

708
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:00,540
Yeah.

709
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,500
So that's why they say like, oh, what happens?

710
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,640
It's like their funeral song.

711
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

712
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:10,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's like super dark, man.

713
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,500
Like, I saw it.

714
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,240

904
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,720

everybody's passion, but sometimes when I'm at, like, VTuber

905
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,280
events, it makes me giggle so much when people get, like,
super offbeat when they're, when they're, uh, wotang, and

906
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,360
they get, like, super offbeat, and it's, like, so
embarrassed.

It's so cute.

1121
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:18,460
It's like I'm a baby.

1122
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,240
That's like something you do in like middle school.

1123
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:21,860
That's an old man challenge.

1124
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,000
I told this in my chat and they were like, I've never heard
of that.

1125
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:24,620
I don't know where to

1126
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,560
be with.

1127
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:45,040
My dad, my dad kid in one house.

1128
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:47,260
I'm hiding from you.

1129
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:54,420
So I thought I thought you were someone to rely on me.

1130
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,580
I guess I was a shoulder.

1131
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,040
I thought we were trying to get out.

1132
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,820
I thought we were trying to get out.

1133
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:05,600
What?

1134
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,780
What is wrong with you?

1135
00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:07,900
I like your song a lot.

1136
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:09,480
I love it.

1137
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:18,110
Happy Christmas.

1138
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:20,330
I gave you my heart.

1139
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:24,410
But the very next day, you gave it away.

1140
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:28,030
Oh, my bad.

1141
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,390
You gave me from tears.

1142
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,750
I'll give it to someone special.

1143
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:38,150
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart.

1144
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:39,590
But the whole...

1145
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:40,150
Oh, my bad.

1146
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:43,490
You gave me away.

1147
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,470
I'll give it to someone special.

1148
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:51,890
Special.

1149
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,200
Yeah.

1150
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:10,520
You said that was this like iconic George, like the iconic
name George.

1151
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:11,800
I forgot his last name.

1152
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,980
It's like a break.

1153
00:57:26,740 --> 00:57:27,500
Wow, he's good.

1154
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,520
Wow,

1155
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:32,950
wow, wow.

1156
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,370
This is a classic.

1157
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:38,250
I don't know why, but I've also been thinking about the
anime working recently.

1158
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:38,770
Yeah, right?

1159
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:39,910
It like disappeared.

1160
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,690
It was so popular and then like disappeared out the face of
the fan.

1161
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:43,090
It was so cool.

1162
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:45,550
I know, it was like such a big thing for a while.

1163
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:46,590
Yeah, it was huge.

1164
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,190
And then I feel like, you did your anime review recently.

1165
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:49,750
Yeah.

1166
00:57:50,050 --> 00:57:52,510
I almost submitted it, but I was afraid you were gonna like,
oh my gosh.

1167
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:53,950
Well, that was the breaks.

1168
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:56,830
No sympathy.

1169
00:57:57,210 --> 00:57:58,350
I know, that's why.

1170
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:00,110
I was like, I can't do it, she wouldn't even be nice.

1171
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:01,710
Wait, let's list a few.

1172
00:58:02,370 --> 00:58:04,150
Oh yeah, wait, yeah, that's weird.

1173
00:58:04,310 --> 00:58:05,670
Oh gosh, I had the picture.

1174
00:58:05,910 --> 00:58:08,870
I put, oh my gosh, why am I blanking?

1175
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,490
I put you two marshmallows on the sheet.

1176
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:10,890
Oh.

1177
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,350
Yeah, I would make fun of you.

1178
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:13,410
Which one?

1179
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:14,510
It's so good!

1180
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:15,290
It's so good!

1181
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:15,850
Wait, what?

1182
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:16,170
Which one?

1183
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:17,170
It's not about Ichigo Marshmallow.

1184
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:21,830
It's about the presence of Ichigo Marshmallow in the
presence of other shows.

1185
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,370
Like what?

1186
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:23,830
Like what?

1187
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,690
Um, Kitamari Sketch, Donon Biori.

1188
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,450
Yeah, I feel like it deserves to be in there.

1189
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,550
I put Ichigo Marshmallow.

1190
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,370
I put Odd Taxi, which is a more recent one.

1191
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,370
Oh, Odd Taxi.

1192
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,430
I hope it's like a Nepuni.

1193
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,610
Oh, yeah.

1194
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:40,270
I put, oh my gosh, I put Stupid, but I can't relate right
now.

1195
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,670
I was pretty nice this time.

1196
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,810
No, but I was like, I don't want to make it.

1197
00:58:45,850 --> 00:58:51,310
Well, no, it's just, it's like I said, it's not really a
rose so much as like, you know, you must know what, what

1198
00:58:51,310 --> 00:58:52,250
this looks like.

1199
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,390
When Sony puts Ichigo Marshmallow and Nonon Biori and
Hidomori's dead.

1200
00:58:55,390 --> 00:58:56,750
Well, I didn't put all that.

1201
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:58,490
Put all your words in my mouth.

1202
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:06,490
I literally just said that I'm just saying that it's about
Ichigo Marshmallow among the presence of other other ones.

1203
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,430
That would cause me to be like, I know what you are.
