1
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:14,250
Welcome back everyone!

2
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,370
Hello everybody!

3
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,490
I got my new hair on!

4
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,670
Hello.

5
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,510
Kept us waiting, huh?

6
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,510
Kept you waiting, huh?

7
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,310
You know, I don't think I've said that a single time.

8
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,090
Like, in time of playing Metal Gear 4.

9
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,990
I don't think.

10
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,550
I don't think.

11
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,390
Birthday!

12
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,730
MGS5 birthday song.

13
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,510
My first MGS game was MGS Touch for the iPhone!

14
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,650
Oh my gosh, that reminds me, I used to have an iPod Touch.

15
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:55,770
Actually, it was my dad's.

16
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,310
But, I basically stole it from him.

17
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,590
And I downloaded the Silent Hill game on it.

18
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,010
There was like a Silent Hill mobile game.

19
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,210
That, it was like a maze.

20
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,990
And you walked around the maze.

21
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,030
And sometimes you'd find nurses.

22
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,970
And I think there was Pyramid Head too.

23
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,630
It was not, it was, the setting was Silent Hill.

24
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,330
There was nothing, no substance.

25
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,390
It was just, it was just a thing.

26
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,750
Happy birthday, congratulations!

27
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,610
Happy birthday with salutations!

28
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,770
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue!

29
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,270
Happy birthday to you!

30
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,030
Happy birthday!

31
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,350
Substance, Metal Gear Substance.

32
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,210
Now, welcome back everybody to Act 4 out of 5.

33
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,470
Of Metal Gear Solid 4.

34
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,110
This, this act is...

35
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,190
Chef's kiss, so good.

36
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,150
Best act in the game.

37
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,050
For sure.

38
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,990
Can we talk about your voice pack?

39
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,050
How many times did you have to record?

40
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,730
Wait, wait, wait.

41
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,070
I didn't want to interrupt your special stream yesterday.

42
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,010
It was my birthday!

43
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,330
Happy birthday, congratulations!

44
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,330
Happy birthday with salutations!

45
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:36,210
Happy birthday, may your sky stay blue!

46
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,410
Happy birthday to you, Skeletor!

47
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,430
Happy birthday!

48
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,770
I saw your tweet being like, does she know?

49
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,570
Actually, it was a total coincidence, but I'm glad that it, that it, that it...

50
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,010
Worked out.

51
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,590
Yeah, the voice pack.

52
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,710
Okay, I guess we can chit-chat a little bit before we start, huh?

53
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:07,870
Because yesterday I didn't get really to chit-chat, because yesterday was Valentine's Day.

54
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,050
And I did a bit of a special stream.

55
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,170
If you haven't watched it, it was quite short.

56
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,410
So, easily digestible.

57
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,210
Oh gosh, the voice pack.

58
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:24,770
It didn't take me that many tries, I think.

59
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,970
Was it...

60
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,210
It was just, you know...

61
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,770
It was...

62
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,570
What do you mean X?

63
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,830
What do you mean?

64
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,070
It was not short, it was average.

65
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,190
No, I think average stream length is like three hours.

66
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,690
It destroyed you?

67
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:55,970
Why?

68
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,850
Why, why, why?

69
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,330
Always a pleasure to see you, Minto!

70
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,630
Thank you, Chiboron!

71
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,630
Thank you so much.

72
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,970
Either she's a stone-cold professional or she actually loves this.

73
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,190
Okay, but I was... I did have to...

74
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,610
So, actually I did get someone to write it for me.

75
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,290
Because I'm not very good at writing scenarios, right?

76
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,130
So, I had someone write it, but then I changed some stuff.

77
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,650
I usually have someone write something for me.

78
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:35,930
And then I will adjust to how my comfort or my...

79
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,490
You know, I don't want it to seem totally unnatural.

80
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:39,950
So...

81
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:47,410
Something that I would actually say, unless it's like a true Isekai otherworldly type of scenario.

82
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,470
Something, something.

83
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,450
Yay!

84
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,570
Thanks to Keizo!

85
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,350
Chat GPT?

86
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,750
No, if you watch...

87
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,490
Oh, somebody did not watch...

88
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:08,670
Oh, LMStray did not watch the stream yesterday.

89
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,950
No, I pay people.

90
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:14,750
I hire.

91
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,870
I hire real humans to write.

92
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,870
I didn't think the voice pack would get you guys like that.

93
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,670
I didn't think the voice pack would get you guys like that.

94
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,330
Before stream, I said I was gonna get coffee.

95
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:39,930
And I didn't.

96
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,630
Because I had no decaf.

97
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,650
Instead, I only... I got tea instead.

98
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,510
So...

99
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,990
But yeah, I'm glad you guys liked the voice pack.

100
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,250
Even though it was embarrassing.

101
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,390
The ending of it was me being like...

102
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,910
Was my reaction to finishing it.

103
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:04,630
That was not in the script.

104
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,450
That was a genuine...

105
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,150
Me being like...

106
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,170
Gosh, I have to say this.

107
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,010
That was not part of it.

108
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,850
That was me being like...

109
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,090
Oh, God!

110
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,480
You have a haiku?

111
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,840
Ghost with metal gear brain rot.

112
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,280
That's me.

113
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,220
Makes everyone laugh with beauty she emits.

114
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,680
You're laughing at my face?

115
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,700
Becoming legend everyone will remember.

116
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,100
Oh, wait.

117
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,880
It's a poetry.

118
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
Snap, snap, snap.

119
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,360
Would you accept my second shirt button?

120
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,800
I sure hope that you guys don't stop snapping off your buttons.

121
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,160
In front of me.

122
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,160
When I do a meet and greet and everybody is wearing a pull-up shirt.

123
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:54,820
No, wait.

124
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,200
A polo shirt.

125
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,180
And everybody starts taking off their buttons.

126
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,360
Just like...

127
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,800
Oh, my gosh.

128
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,580
You go to like a VTuber convention.

129
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,300
And everybody is walking around with just one button.

130
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,700
Like popped off.

131
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,560
And like that part of the shirt open.

132
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,620
It's like becomes a new fashion trend.

133
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,840
Will there be yelling about Naomi in this stream?

134
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,780
I don't think Naomi happens in this chapter.

135
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:21,880
Oh, no.

136
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,700
No.

137
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,900
I just lied.

138
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,160
I just big lied.

139
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,740
Yes, I will be yelling about Naomi.

140
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,460
Oh, yeah.

141
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,780
Sorry, I completely forgot.

142
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,300
Yes.

143
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,960
Yes, there will be big yelling about Naomi.

144
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
I'm so sorry.

145
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,660
Oh, gosh.

146
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,960
This is the peak of her bullshittery.

147
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,980
Right here.

148
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,400
In the stream.

149
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,340
Time for Naomi crash.

150
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,080
I don't think I'll be able to watch it.

151
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:54,300
Oh, God.

152
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,460
I'm already getting old.

153
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:56,660
Okay.

154
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,720
No, I said I wouldn't cry.

155
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,080
Okay, I'm okay.

156
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,760
I'm cool.

157
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm calm.

158
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,640
I'm a cucumber.

159
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,020
I'm a cucumber.

160
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,100
Oh, my gosh.

161
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,060
Okay.

162
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:11,980
Focus.

163
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm focused.

164
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,760
I'm focused.

165
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,220
Today's a great act.

166
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,780
So much cinema today.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,320
Oh, God.

168
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,620
Hold on.

169
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,340
Let me wipe my tears.

170
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,640
But the voice pack, it had art with it.

171
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,540
Wait, not saying you should do it.

172
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:27,680
Wait.

173
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,040
You're not saying you should do it for this one.

174
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,340
But if you continue doing that for future ones, have you considered including the art file with the voice pack file?

175
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,880
I can.

176
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,800
Probably.

177
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,340
Let me ask the artist.

178
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,380
What's my DM?

179
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Who's DMing me?

180
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,600
Okay.

181
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,020
Thank you.

182
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,480
Happy 10 months, Mito.

184
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,580
Happy 10 months.

185
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,520
Laugh and grow fat.

186
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,560
Yeah.

187
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,380
Welcome back.

188
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,380
Rendog, welcome back.

189
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,400
MGS4 Act 4 and Bocchi the Rock Season 2 announced.

190
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,500
Today is a good day.

191
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,340
Yeah.

192
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:29,100
I did see that, that Bocchi the Rock Season 2 was announced.

193
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
Surprised it wasn't announced any sooner.

194
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,920
Also, it feels...

195
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,040
Is there like an event happening this weekend in Japan?

196
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,800
It just feels like a random day.

197
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,540
Like, is it like Anime Japan this weekend?

198
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,580
Or, like, any event?

199
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:43,960
Or...

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Just...

201
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,420
Just...

202
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,580
They were like, yeah, we're gonna announce that.

203
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,100
I don't know.

204
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,860
It's just so funny that it's like a random...

205
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,960
WAN Fest was last week.

206
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

207
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,380
Anime Japan is next month.

208
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,620
Then what the heck?

209
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,420
Oh, hi, Mahler.

210
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,460
Oh...

211
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,160
Wouldn't you know more?

212
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,020
Well, how would I know?

213
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,400
What are you saying?

214
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm such a big weeaboo that I should know every event that happens.

215
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,540
Every anime single...

216
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,460
Every single anime event that happens in Japan.

217
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:18,860
Every...

218
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,800
Every day!

219
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,920
I'm gonna build my Rex kit.

220
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,720
I want to see it.

221
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,720
Post pictures on Twitter if you have a Twitter.

222
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,000
Hmm...

223
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,040
Um...

224
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,500
I feel like I was gonna say something.

225
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,540
I don't remember what.

226
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,040
Oh, well.

227
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:43,480
Yay!

228
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,200
Spawn of thee!

229
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:45,860
Welcome back!

230
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh my gosh!

231
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,360
Your profile picture reminded me.

232
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,560
You have Clannad.

233
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,080
But, did you guys see that Air?

234
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,080
The Air visual novel?

235
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,060
And stuff is being released on Steam.

236
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,360
And then also a bunch of soundtracks, too.

237
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,300
And, like, Natsukage.

238
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,260
Oh my gosh, I love.

239
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,100
I love Natsukage album.

240
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,640
Oh, it's so good!

241
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,460
Oh!

242
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,360
So, if you are a fan of, like, key visual novels...

243
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,520
Like, Kanon and...

244
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,260
Uh...

245
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,740
Clannad...

246
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,660
And...

247
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,100
Uh...

248
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,260
Angel Beats and...

249
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:17,700
Yeah!

250
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

251
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,480
Will you scream about the Snotacon in this chapter?

252
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,600
I will scream about lots of things, probably.

253
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,620
I think that's guaranteed.

254
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,900
With a minion of Metal Gear.

255
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,220
I think so.

256
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,180
I think so.

257
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,100
It was one of my first key anime.

258
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,260
My first key anime was...

259
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,480
Kanon.

260
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,780
I think.

261
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,840
I think.

262
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,580
Maybe.

263
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:49,320
Maybe.

264
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,550
But, I've seen...

265
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,400
You know what?

266
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,510
Actually, I own...

267
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,760
I have Little Busters.

268
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,840
I've played a little bit of Little Busters.

269
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,640
But, I have not seen the anime.

270
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,380
The anime for Little Busters took so long to come out.

271
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,700
And then, by the time it came out, I was, like, too busy to watch it.

272
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,560
And I...

273
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,220
There was another one.

274
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,520
Oh, gosh.

275
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,840
I remember...

276
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,440
It's the girl in the red uniform.

277
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,900
I haven't played or watched that one either.

278
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,380
Charlotte!

279
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,320
Charlotte, Charlotte, Charlotte.

280
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,280
Uh, uh, uh.

281
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

282
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,740
Boss-a-lot.

283
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,460
Oh, my gosh.

284
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,480
I saw the best Boss-a-lot art on Twitter the other day.

285
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,640
My favorite Boss-a-lot art is the young Ocelot with Boss.

286
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,680
And it's very...

287
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,260
Not very common to see.

288
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:55,780
So, often, you'll see MGS5 Ocelot with Boss.

289
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:56,900
But...

290
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,040
Oh, I saw.

291
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,400
Oh, I saw.

292
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,840
Oh, I saw the young Ocelot with Boss.

293
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,960
My head hurts.

294
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,920
Yeah, baby, that's what I'm talking about.

295
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,960
It wasn't even spicy.

296
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,780
It was just so cute.

297
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,160
Okay.

298
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,840
Retweet?

299
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,720
I'll do it right now.

300
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,720
Let me get on my phone.

301
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,880
And then we'll start the game.

302
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,260
Oh, oh.

303
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:34,920
I did.

304
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,640
That's... I remember what I wanted to say earlier.

305
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:45,780
Before the stream, I watched a video of the Spirit Photography spots in Shadow Moses.

306
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,860
I don't think I'll remember all of them, so I will probably pull up a guide.

307
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,740
Oh, my God.

308
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,280
Just...

309
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,740
Sorry, I just...

310
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,820
I saw it again.

311
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,300
Okay, retweet.

312
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,060
Repost.

313
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,060
Sorry.

314
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
Is it spicy?

315
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,280
No, not even a tiny bit.

316
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,900
It's really cute, though.

317
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,980
Okay.

318
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,140
Okay.

319
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,840
Yeah, so...

320
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,140
I just punched my mic.

321
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,480
Let me pull up a guide for the Spirit Photography.

322
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,080
Spirit... MGS4.

323
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,980
Spirit Photography.

324
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,940
But I think I remember a lot of them.

325
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,560
I think.

326
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,740
But probably not every of them.

327
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,640
Okay.

328
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:52,940
Okay.

329
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,040
I think I'm good.

330
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:54,740
Okay.

331
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,400
Yes.

332
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,760
Is the mic okay?

333
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,860
Mic is fine.

334
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,640
Actually, I punched the...

335
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,360
This is the mic here.

336
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:10,020
And I punched the arm that holds the mic.

337
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,140
It's kind of low, so...

338
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:12,620
Okay.

339
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Let's start.

340
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,680
Let's start.

341
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,520
Mikey Mike.

342
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,740
Mikey Mike Mike.

343
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,860
Mike and Ike.

344
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,820
I think I'm over...

345
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,200
Let me scoot a little bit more.

346
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,680
So you guys can see some stuff.

347
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,280
Nope, nope.

348
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,200
Nope.

349
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,580
Okay.

350
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,620
And we got the camera.

351
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,040
I didn't take any photos though, did I?

352
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,070
Were these already on there?

353
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,490
Wait, I don't think I've ever seen these before.

354
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,430
Also, the ramen is called the Hide-chan.

355
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,130
It's so cute.

356
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,090
Woah.

357
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,750
Oh my gosh, old-timey.

358
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,410
This is so cute!

359
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,490
Even though it has my least favorite person ever in the world.

360
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,110
These are so cute.

361
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,630
Paying you what you're due, naniwazuni.

362
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:03,190
She's like, no!

363
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,870
The ramen!

364
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,450
Sunny and Naomi 6.

365
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,250
What is happening?

366
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,450
Oh, they're fighting over...

367
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,630
Let Sunny cook!

368
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,470
Let Sunny cook!

369
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,810
These are so cute.

370
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:19,610
Kill her, Sunny!

371
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,890
Oh my god, yes!

372
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,210
Oh my god, she can actually kill her here!

373
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,210
With the frying pan!

374
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,550
She's a genius!

375
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:29,710
Let her cook.

376
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:30,370
These are...

377
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,650
I think I'm going in the wrong order.

378
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,370
Okay, hold on.

379
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,750
Let's go...

380
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,610
Oh, she's got her little eggs.

381
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,530
See, there's only three eggs.

382
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,010
No room for you, Naomi.

383
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,490
Get out of the room.

384
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,610
Get out of the scene, Naomi.

385
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,350
Okay, so...

386
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,310
Number one...

387
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,180
And then they're like...

388
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,930
Naomi's trying to blind us.

389
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,070
Because she's evil.

390
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,210
She's trying to literally kill us.

391
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,250
Make us go blind.

392
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,250
So that we die.

393
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,080
Pure evil.

394
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Evil incarnate.

395
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,320
And then...

396
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,840
Wow!

397
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,800
Oh my god!

398
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:12,940
Then she...

399
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,180
How did this happen?

400
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,200
Wait...

401
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,940
The eggs go from the pan...

402
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,340
Sorry, I didn't mean to change it.

403
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,400
To Sunny's head.

404
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,980
I think this is sabotage.

405
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,740
Naomi controlled the eggs with the nanomachines.

406
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,220
To burn Sunny.

407
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,740
Because she's evil.

408
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,080
She's evil.

409
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,060
She made them with the nanomachines.

410
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,440
She made them fly onto her head.

411
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,080
And then Sunny...

412
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,200
Says...

413
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,040
I won't let you win.

414
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,660
You evil woman.

415
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,340
Yeah, Sunny will remember this.

416
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,680
Oh, you can fullscreen it too.

417
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,500
Get back!

418
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,100
Wait, hold on.

419
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,760
Get back, Sunny!

420
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,120
Get back!

421
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,500
I won't let this evil woman get to you!

422
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,780
I won't let her touch you!

423
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,880
Get back!

424
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,420
Get behind me, Sunny!

425
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,520
Get behind me!

426
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,080
Get behind me, Sunny!

427
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,540
And...

428
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,080
I like this one a lot though.

429
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,340
I didn't notice that the ramen was called the Hide-chan.

430
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,180
So cute.

431
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,840
And look, there's only three forks.

432
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,060
Not four.

433
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:40,620
One for Snake, one for Otacon, and one for Sunny.

434
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,120
No room, no place for Naomi.

435
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
You are...

436
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,340
You are intruding on this peaceful life.

437
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,660
I want the Gacko clock so bad.

438
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,640
I want one.

439
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,920
I want one.

440
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,080
Okay, anyway.

441
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,540
That was cute.

442
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,260
So we are loading the game.

443
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,640
And we are here.

444
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,920
Act 4 briefing.

445
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:15,560
We just...

446
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,440
We watched last time.

447
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,840
Oh, I guess we can do a little bit of a summary, right?

448
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,080
So...

449
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,600
Act 3 was where we met Big Mama.

450
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,920
We went to Europe...

451
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,600
TM.

452
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,220
We went to Europe, TM, and we met Big Mama who was Eva.

453
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,280
From MGS3.

454
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:39,040
And she was just like, hey, Big Boss is actually still alive.

455
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,340
He's a soupy man in a bag.

456
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,380
He's just...

457
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,360
Put your fries in the bag?

458
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:47,700
No.

459
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,620
Put your boss in the bag.

460
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,300
Proposal.

461
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,000
We eat Naomi into the ocean and then photoshop Minto's head over Naomi in all the pictures.

462
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,140
No, I don't want Sunny to hate me though.

463
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,060
But I would love to eat instant noodles with Sunny.

464
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,040
That would be so good.

465
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,080
Europe.

466
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,660
Yeah.

467
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,980
And we had this epic car chase.

468
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,280
Just like in MGS3.

469
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,000
It was so fun.

470
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:23,680
And I did such a good job shooting Rootin' Tootin' with auto-aim.

471
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,280
And then...

472
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,240
Then...

473
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,000
We...

474
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,660
Then we met up with...

475
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,060
With Ocelot.

476
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,880
Liquid Ocelot.

477
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,660
And he did bang, bang, bang.

478
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh yeah, Raging Raven.

479
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,920
First we fought Raging Raven.

480
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,000
Sorry, I'm getting...

481
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm only remembering the important plot points.

482
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,660
Yeah, we did fight Raging Raven.

483
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,500
Yep, yep, yep.

484
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:57,500
And then we met Liquid Ocelot.

485
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,000
And he went bang, bang, bang.

486
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,760
And there was like a big ambush from Meryl and friends.

487
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,280
And they were like...

488
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,120
They were like...

489
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,420
No!

490
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,340
And Ocelot was like, your guns don't work.

491
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,700
Bang, bang, bang.

492
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,180
And then everybody had IBS.

493
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,380
And then...

494
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,140
Except Johnny, of course.

495
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,840
That guy is hot.

496
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,940
He's smoking hot.

497
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,100
He rescued Meryl.

498
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,280
He even kissed her and then she kissed him.

499
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,160
Pull my devil trigger.

500
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,640
Yeah, he said it twice.

501
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,420
It was important.

502
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,160
It's true.

503
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,280
Johnny already has IBS.

504
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,120
The IBS master.

505
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,540
True.

506
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,300
That guy doesn't need nano...

507
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,060
He doesn't need man-made IBS.

508
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,240
He's all natural.

509
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,480
And so...

510
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,160
Unfortunately, Big Mama dies.

511
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,220
Sad, sad, sad, sad.

512
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,980
And Big Boss' body is cooked to a crisp.

513
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,100
He becomes...

514
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,720
He becomes...

515
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
Fried chicken.

516
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,360
Does that count as a spoiler?

517
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:08,920
What?

518
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,140
Don't worry about it.

519
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,800
And...

520
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,960
Then we are told that...

521
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,860
Ocelot is going to Shadow Moses.

522
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,380
He's gotta go fetch Rex.

523
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,100
And they're like, why does he gotta get Rex?

524
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,140
And...

525
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,380
What was it again?

526
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,080
Oh, he wants the gun.

527
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,920
Your new mission is to infiltrate this maid cafe and uncover the secret new mana gear.

528
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:47,440
Oh, wait.

529
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,820
It's the new manager.

530
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,380
No!

531
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,800
The real guy in here.

532
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,220
Today's my birthday!

533
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,720
Could you recommend a Metal Gear Solid to start playing?

534
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,180
Ocelot, we love the new hairstyle.

535
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,260
Thank you, Seymour!

536
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,040
Of course, you must start with Metal Gear Solid!

537
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,880
The first, Metal Gear Solid 1.

538
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,300
Happy birthday!

539
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,200
Congratulations!

540
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,040
Happy birthday!

541
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,820
With salutations!

542
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,720
Happy birthday!

543
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,320
May your sky stay blue!

544
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,560
Happy birthday to you!

545
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,540
Seymour, happy birthday!

546
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,840
Stop saying V!

547
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,320
V!

548
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,380
Thank you, Black Yoshi.

549
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,400
Thank you!

550
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,000
Yes, that.

551
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,620
That, that.

552
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,080
He was just like, I need the gun.

553
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:59,980
He's trying to get control of the Patriots, so he's just like, I gotta take out the stuff that's controlling the Patriots.

554
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,600
That the Patriots have control of.

555
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,040
So, it's just like, oh yeah!

556
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,160
We're gonna shoot that thing down!

557
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,540
With a railgun!

558
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,060
Okay, so we're all up to speed on the last chapter.

559
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,800
Look, you can see Big Mama there.

560
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,360
Snake got really burnt.

561
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,620
He got really badly hurt.

562
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,700
It's very sad.

563
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,060
Raiden is still not feeling good.

564
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,500
That guy is still sleepy.

565
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,520
Only my railgun.

566
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,140
Okay.

567
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,560
And off to Shadow Moses!

568
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,660
Loading, loading.

569
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,880
Too much Europe.

570
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,660
Guess so.

571
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,900
Harry Mann, welcome to membership.

572
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,580
Thank you!

573
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,760
Minto Snake Tome and Liquid Dookie Ocelot.

574
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,840
What the heck?

575
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,060
Guys, I loaded the wrong game!

576
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,300
My bad.

577
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,940
Shadow Moses.

578
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:31,980
Shadow Moses in its prime.

579
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,660
That guy is coming.

580
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,880
So realistic.

581
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,180
Wow!

582
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,480
Our cigarettes.

583
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,000
Snake's favorite.

584
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,620
Our scope.

585
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,740
Wow, we got everything!

586
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,260
I have no weapons.

587
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,780
Just like the original.

588
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,680
We got a ration!

589
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,520
Very nice.

590
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,860
Where is that guy?

591
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,740
Oh, shit.

592
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:05,700
Hello?

593
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,800
I want to go choke him.

594
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,380
Maybe I can grab his butt.

595
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,920
Oops, wrong button.

596
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,820
He is fine.

597
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,320
No gun.

598
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,260
Return to your positions everybody.

599
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:40,880
We are fine.

600
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,780
Where is...

601
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,380
No gun.

602
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,440
No gun.

603
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,260
It's under?

604
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:54,880
Hold on.

605
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,060
Don't look in here.

606
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,330
Call Otacon.

607
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,630
Actually, you can't use the...

608
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,530
You can't...

609
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:08,850
Codec.

610
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,800
Is it under here?

611
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,420
I'm crawling, I'm crawling, I'm crawling, crawling, crawling.

612
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,140
There is nothing in here.

613
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,800
Boop, beep, boop, bop, bop, bop.

614
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,420
Yeah, why would I call Otacon?

615
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,960
We literally just start...

616
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,820
We don't even know who that guy is.

617
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,120
Call Campbell.

618
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,540
I can't even open the...

619
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,960
I can't even open the codec.

620
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,900
El Gato is doing it's bestest.

621
00:32:59,740 --> 00:32:59,960
OK.

622
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,240
My game crashed.

623
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,920
Everything alright Snake?

624
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,600
I was having that dream again.

625
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,400
Over here.

626
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Shadow Moses.

627
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,000
Shadow Moses.

628
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
It's a lot windier than I remember.

629
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,720
How is Otacon able to fly through here?

630
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,540
Nice.

631
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:38,800
Isn't that such an awesome little...

632
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,120
I didn't want to spoil that last week.

633
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,060
Because it's such a cool little...

634
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,220
Even like your console kind of freaks out for a bit.

635
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,560
Because it's a just...

636
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
It's the actual...

637
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,220
It's actual MGS1.

638
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,460
It's so awesome.

639
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,560
So awesome.

640
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,740
Twin suns.

641
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,050
It's really...

642
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,150
How can you even navigate through this?

643
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,030
How can you see anything?

644
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,270
Oh gosh Snake.

645
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,210
The ice on the camera lens.

646
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,570
This is truly a movie.

647
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:32,550
I mean Snake is fine.

648
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,330
Guys.

649
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,110
Otacon is so cool.

650
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:35,630
Yes.

651
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:43,850
Yeah.

652
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,890
I just slipped a little.

653
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:48,830
Grandpa.

654
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,290
Meet the Mark 3.

655
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,010
Hey honey.

656
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,530
Welcome to the revolution.

657
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,090
Thank you.

658
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:05,930
Okay.

659
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,550
Oh gosh.

660
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,350
I don't remember where these bozos are.

661
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,750
Bye bye.

662
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,610
Bye Otacon.

663
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,370
Bye bye.

664
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,350
Oh Snake.

665
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,070
It's okay.

666
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,710
We'll get you that compress buddy.

667
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,990
It's so breezy.

668
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:28,230
Welcome back to Shadow Moses.

669
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,350
The west.

670
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:33,230
Okay.

671
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:33,950
Oh my god.

672
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,770
I can't see anything.

673
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,730
Holy moly.

674
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,390
I forgot how difficult this part is.

675
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,090
In terms of visibility.

676
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,510
One second.

677
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,250
I do want to check something real quick.

678
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,650
I want to see if I have a certain weapon.

679
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,810
And we will be using this.

680
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,570
In a bit.

681
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:54,690
So, sorry for the spoilers.

682
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,770
But I do need this.

683
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,830
We're going to switch out.

684
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,390
Because, like you said, it's unnamed here.

685
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,770
So I'm assuming I can kill everything.

686
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,310
Yeah.

687
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,970
So, swap.

688
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,990
But let me see if I have the weapon that I want.

689
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,590
Which one was it actually?

690
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:26,390
Hold on.

691
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,150
Hold on.

692
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:29,930
One second.

693
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:31,750
Oh yeah.

694
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,510
And I have my...

695
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,410
I have my, what's it called?

696
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:35,930
Okay.

697
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,090
Do I not...

698
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,030
Oh, maybe I can buy it.

699
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:45,970
Let me see how much it costs.

700
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,550
Let me see how much it costs.

701
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:50,210
I'm not playing on Sunday.

702
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,590
I should have remembered to play this game on Sunday instead.

703
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:55,790
This one.

704
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,370
I can't afford it.

705
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:58,330
Guys.

706
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,030
I know I'm saving up, but...

707
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,470
This thing.

708
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,950
This gun.

709
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:12,970
This gun can take out the geckos in like two or three hits.

710
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,350
It's so good.

711
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,410
It's actually so good.

712
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,570
And I kind of really want it.

713
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,530
It's like half of our money.

714
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,690
It's half of our money.

715
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:36,270
I've worked so hard to get here.

716
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,670
Seisminto has a patriot in her weapons.

717
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,170
Yeah, it was the last stream.

718
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,250
Wait for Sunday?

719
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:50,810
No, I need it today.

720
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,090
What, should I just end stream and play on Sunday?

721
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:55,530
No.

722
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,470
Oh, gosh.

723
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,570
I didn't realize.

724
00:37:57,930 --> 00:37:59,930
I should have scheduled this for Sunday instead.

725
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,460
Use the rail gun.

726
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,880
It takes too long to charge up.

727
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,020
Change the PS3 clock.

728
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,920
I guess I could do that.

729
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,580
I guess I could do that.

730
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,220
Otsumito, see you tomorrow.

731
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,580
Two or three shots more than enough to kill anything that moves.

732
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,300
That's too good.

733
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,230
Mr. Resetti will yell at me.

734
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,090
So true.

735
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,370
Plus two.

736
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:54,690
That was a 10 out of 10 joke.

737
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,390
I'm gonna do it.

738
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,230
I'm gonna change my system clock.

739
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,630
System settings.

740
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:19,830
One moment, please.

741
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,230
One moment, please.

742
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,050
One moment, please.

743
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,370
Spending time to save a few dollars.

744
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,730
More like saving a lot of dollars.

745
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,910
Saving so many dollars.

746
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:40,910
Wait, what?

747
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,160
Adjust it.

748
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,900
Oh, there we go.

749
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,180
Okay.

750
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,740
Set manually.

751
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,400
16.

752
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,600
Oh, yeah, baby.

753
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,200
Okay.

754
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,320
Oh, yeah, baby.

755
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,180
Snake.

756
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,340
You just...

757
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:14,980
Wait, what was it?

758
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:16,920
You...

759
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,400
You...

760
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,920
There was a...

761
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
That was a time paradox.

762
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,720
The end will die of old age.

763
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,120
But yeah, there's nothing like that in this game, so...

764
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,420
I think we're okay.

765
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,740
Okay.

766
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,180
I think we're alright.

767
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,420
Let me pull up my...

768
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,280
It's more like we're saving...

769
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,380
I think it's 50% off, right?

770
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,060
Love your content, man.

771
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,480
Can't wait for Sussy Liquid Ocelot appears.

772
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,300
Oh, yeah.

773
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,260
Thanks, Danny.

774
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,400
Thank you so much.

775
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,100
20%.

776
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,420
Oh.

777
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,800
I guess it is a few dollars then.

778
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,340
Oh, sorry.

779
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,840
I just realized you guys can't see the game.

780
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,820
There we go.

781
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,780
You've...

782
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,340
Oh, that's right.

783
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,220
You created a time paradox.

784
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,640
Let's see if this works.

785
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,380
Load game.

786
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,780
Yes.

787
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,960
The 100,000 DP you can get later on.

788
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,300
We need like 4,000,000.

789
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,600
Yeah.

790
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,760
We need like so many more million thousand.

791
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:40,820
Alright.

792
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:41,580
Sorry.

793
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,220
I'm gonna skip the little cutscene.

794
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,260
I'm gonna skip the cutscene.

795
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:53,900
Skip.

796
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:57,490
Oh, yeah.

797
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:58,930
There are big sales on Act 5.

798
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,450
So true.

799
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,050
Yeah.

800
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,050
He's like...

801
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:05,330
Okay.

802
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,050
I don't remember how to...

803
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:17,210
You know, there's a way to avoid the sneak pass.

804
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,530
I mean, I have to sneak pass anyway.

805
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,690
But we'll get the gun.

806
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,050
Wait, what's Sunny doing?

807
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:25,770
She's hacking.

808
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,490
Imagine if you were on a real life race against the clock because of snake's condition.

809
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,910
Don't say that!

810
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,350
Makes me really depressed.

811
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,290
Look at that.

812
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:46,170
We saved 40,000 DP.

813
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:48,930
Bye.

814
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,970
It hurts.

815
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,190
It

816
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,460
hurts.

817
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,760
Oh, but it's important.

818
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,560
It's a good weapon to have especially in this area.

819
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,240
I'll show you guys.

820
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,680
First thing we come up against.

821
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:18,580
Where is it?

822
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:18,940
There it is.

823
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,000
I'll show you guys.

824
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,940
It's a good, good weapon.

825
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,560
Let me see how to use it.

826
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,420
So it's just like a sniper?

827
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:27,840
Okay.

828
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,860
Yeah, just like that.

829
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,140
I can't see anything.

830
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,500
Okay.

831
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,520
Oh my god, I'm lost.

832
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,980
That way?

833
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,560
Not the way.

834
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,540
Hell yeah, savings.

835
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,640
Catch my favorite act live.

836
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,400
I feel like this is probably everyone's favorite act.

837
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,000
It doesn't matter if you're a critic of the game.

838
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,760
I think everyone can agree that this act is just...

839
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,220
So good.

840
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,800
Sorry, I'm gonna be checking the map quite a bit.

841
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,120
Weee!

842
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,800
I heard it!

843
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:17,890
I heard it!

844
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,440
I'm scared of the geckos.

845
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,980
Even though I have a big gun now, I'm scared.

846
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,560
I see it on the map.

847
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,940
I'm scared.

848
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,860
You can use the night vision.

849
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:41,620
Let me try.

850
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,520
Can you?

851
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:42,820
Okay.

852
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,320
Sorry for everybody's eyes.

853
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:53,870
Let's try it.

854
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,480
And she's down.

855
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:13,560
Not even an alert.

856
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,000
Nothing.

857
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:18,020
What's over here?

858
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,640
Little rats!

859
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,640
Follow the rats, they're my friends.

860
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,740
Follow the rats, they're my friends.

861
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,820
The little rats are my friends.

862
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,680
Wait, I don't think I've ever noticed this area before.

863
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,520
Oh my gosh, it's really breezy in here.

864
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:37,620
Hello little rats!

865
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,540
They're my friends.

866
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,100
Follow the rats, they're my friends.

867
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,440
Follow the rats, they're my friends.

868
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:53,910
Where am I?

869
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:59,160
Keep going north.

870
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,400
Doobie.

871
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,540
I was playing Meow Tower.

872
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,340
Which is a...

873
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,680
What's it called?

874
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,960
It is a...

875
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,190
It's a...

876
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:20,030
Oh my gosh!

877
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,950
Picross!

878
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:24,130
It's Picross, but with cats.

879
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,870
And there was one that has different themes, obviously.

880
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,750
Because you make the pictures with the Picross.

881
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,090
The one I got latest was jumping creatures.

882
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:40,210
And it had Doobie in it!

883
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:46,050
Why can't I remember the animal now?

884
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,100
Jabula.

885
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,010
We're here!

886
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,170
Shadow Moses!

887
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,670
We were just over here earlier!

888
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:19,370
It's Snake.

889
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:21,690
I'm in front of the disposal facility.

890
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:23,310
Excellent Snake.

891
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:25,810
How's that sneaking suit working out?

892
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:29,090
I'm nice and dry, but it's a little hard to move.

893
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:31,230
Bear with it.

894
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,210
It's designed to prevent hypothermia.

895
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:35,250
This is Alaska, you know.

896
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,100
There's one up here too.

897
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:54,640
A Hind D.

898
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,200
What's a Russian gunship doing here?

899
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,840
Wow, you must be crazy to fly Hind in this kind of weather.

900
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,140
Who's that?

901
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:03,960
Nice to meet you Snake.

902
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:06,860
It's an honor to speak to a living legend like yourself.

903
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,360
It's so good!

904
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,100
I don't want to go in there.

905
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,560
I don't want to go in there.

906
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,500
No!

907
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,540
Wait, I didn't want to get this surveillance camera.

908
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:45,620
That's a thumbnail.

909
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,640
I wanted to get the other surveillance camera.

910
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,840
The one in here.

911
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,060
How do I get up there?

912
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:08,400
Do I have to drop down?

913
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:08,900
Yeah.

914
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:23,810
It's still at least you can see it.

915
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:26,950
Oh, it's also broken.

916
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,730
I guess they drop at the same time.

917
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,750
I would love to see like a...

918
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:35,430
What's it called?

919
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,070
A camera.

920
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:45,450
You know how like during cutscenes people will like sometimes hack games so that it will be like a free roaming camera?

921
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,250
I would love to see if both of them fall at the same time.

922
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,090
If that's the case.

923
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:53,770
Okay, so we have to hold the mantis doll.

924
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:54,770
I believe.

925
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:57,450
Our spooky doll.

926
00:49:58,490 --> 00:49:59,710
And let me grab the camera.

927
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,990
We'll switch out...

928
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:06,990
Something.

929
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,320
I don't want to switch out my iPod.

930
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,800
The drum kit.

931
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,300
And we'll do the camera.

932
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:17,020
There it is.

933
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,380
Okay.

934
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:21,340
Spooky times happening now.

935
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:22,840
Time for spooky.

936
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,480
Spooky spooky!

937
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:28,320
Okay, I don't think I'm gonna remember all of these but I'll try.

938
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,260
First person photo mode.

939
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,400
Open that and press...

940
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,840
Oh, to switch between the first... Okay.

941
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,240
Where is he?

942
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,520
What is second person?

943
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,520
Oh, cool.

944
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,620
Do I need the sorrow doll?

945
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:08,640
Wait.

946
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:12,340
I am holding the doll.

947
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,060
Is it the sorrow doll instead of the mantis doll!?

948
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:24,730
No way.

949
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,050
I don't think I have the sorrow doll.

950
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,760
No!

951
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,120
Wait, how do you get the sorrow doll?

952
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:55,360
No, I watched... I studied that video!

953
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:56,700
No!

954
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,280
How do you have the dolls already?

955
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,100
Because I've played this game before.

956
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,360
I've played these games before!

957
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,680
Does Drebin sell it?

958
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:13,700
It's a mantis fight.

959
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:14,120
What?

960
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,680
I didn't even realize that he dropped more than one.

961
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,320
What is that?

962
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,920
What is Sunny doing?

963
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,120
Oh, she's sitting!

964
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,280
Oh my gosh, I thought that was like a naked body on the ground in front of her.

965
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,020
What is that though?

966
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,640
What is that?

967
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,280
It looks like a naked deformed body.

968
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,040
I don't think Drebin would sell it.

969
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,120
That guy doesn't sell anything.

970
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,820
Well, he sells these, which is kind of funny.

971
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,260
It's kind of funny that he sells these.

972
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,800
He's just like, you don't want to earn it?

973
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,340
You don't want to play the game good?

974
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:08,780
I

975
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:14,400
wanted to do a spirit photography.

976
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,240
I'm so mad at myself.

977
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,980
I didn't realize it wasn't the mantis doll.

978
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,400
Stupid.

979
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,160
Oh well.

980
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,460
Oh well.

981
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,560
Oh well.

982
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,380
Oh well.

983
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,100
Do it next year?

984
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,180
Do it next year?

985
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,580
Well, there would have been one like right here.

986
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,280
There was one over there.

987
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:50,760
There's one in here.

988
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,360
I don't remember if there's one in there.

989
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:57,000
Can you take a pic and it might show up?

990
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:57,680
I don't know.

991
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,100
What is that?

992
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:04,500
Oh, thanks.

993
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:12,820
Nice.

994
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:17,880
Nice.

995
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,140
You do not need the dolls for the ghost.

996
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:22,760
You don't?

997
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,620
Are you sure?

998
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,500
But I tried... I went to the area and there was still...

999
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,940
Just take the shot in the right place.

1000
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,120
Maybe...

1001
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,940
Holding the sorrow doll probably allows you to see it in the camera then.

1002
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,440
I imagine.

1003
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:56,940
Oh gosh, I'm not going to remember though.

1004
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,640
Sorry.

1005
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,080
Did you guys see?

1006
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,680
Spooky.

1007
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,660
Oh my gosh, it's even scarier.

1008
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,960
Wait, is it here?

1009
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:24,920
Is it here?

1010
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:27,540
No!

1011
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:35,740
It's a genome soldier!

1012
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:43,620
Oh gosh, I don't remember where this one... I think it's like right here or something.

1013
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:47,160
It's so... I was about to say sweaty.

1014
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:48,400
It's so snowy.

1015
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,200
I know there's one over here, I think.

1016
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,320
I kept the young snake camo on.

1017
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,920
I couldn't bear to see my favorite character so old and worn down.

1018
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,740
Yeah, I know a lot of people feel that way.

1019
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,880
Wait, let me get my guide.

1020
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,180
Let me get my guide.

1021
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,400
Look above the chaff grenade.

1022
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,800
Oh my gosh, I can't see!

1023
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,640
I can't see anything!

1024
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,240
How's the bit rate in this part?

1025
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,660
It was here.

1026
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,140
Nothing.

1027
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:31,880
What do you mean?

1028
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,300
This guide sucks!

1029
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,720
Absolute shit!

1030
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,640
It says literally at the heliport, look above the chaff grenades with your cam...

1031
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,140
Shitty ass guide.

1032
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:43,380
I hate it.

1033
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,840
They were right there.

1034
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,110
There's nothing here!

1035
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:05,750
I think I got it.

1036
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:07,350
I think I got it.

1037
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:11,390
We got it!

1038
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:19,630
Inside...

1039
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:26,470
On the west of the heliport, enter the southernmost hangar inside or left to...

1040
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,210
Okay, I think I got that one.

1041
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:30,930
I wish it would say which ghost it is.

1042
00:57:33,410 --> 00:57:35,890
Northeast of the heliport, see some stairs.

1043
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:38,410
Ghost is next to the camera.

1044
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:43,840
A ghost!

1045
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:46,600
Some stairs.

1046
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,820
First person gameplay.

1047
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,260
First ever done before in Metal Gear.

1048
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:54,660
Stairs?

1049
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:55,860
Oh, on the east.

1050
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,180
That's right, I was trying to get this one earlier.

1051
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,020
I was like, I know there's one over here.

1052
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,640
I'm gonna have to delete all my failures.

1053
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:07,480
No.

1054
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:08,360
Higher?

1055
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,120
This is gonna be so hard without the doll.

1056
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,380
Maybe towards the stairs more.

1057
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:20,720
No.

1058
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,150
Next to the...

1059
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,950
The ghost is near the camera.

1060
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:30,810
This guide is so stinky!

1061
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:36,170
Don't forget the ghost in the bottom right.

1062
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:38,190
Oh, I tried to wink.

1063
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,330
Get my best side!

1064
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,190
I only have one!

1065
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,170
Did you see him?

1066
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:52,210
Okay, to the west of the main door you will find a vent.

1067
00:58:56,430 --> 00:58:57,530
Don't go inside yet.

1068
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,050
Look at those guys in there!

1069
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:00,110
They're rolling around!

1070
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:04,530
The vent.

1071
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,280
Above it is the ghost.

1072
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,900
And inside, you guys, there's an even better surprise of a ghost.

1073
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,420
I'll show you.

1074
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:29,800
Oh,

1075
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:37,740
there he is!

1076
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,360
No, where did he go?

1077
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:44,180
I'm getting his damn chin!

1078
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:47,380
Where are you?

1079
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,320
Where is he?

1080
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,540
Master?

1081
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,500
I'm getting his chin!

1082
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,200
He's like up here.

1083
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,740
What?

1084
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,820
Master?

1085
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,120
Do I need to go up more?

1086
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:19,910
Back up more.

1087
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:22,670
Like here?

1088
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,340
I'm going to have so many...

1089
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:32,420
So many failure photos.

1090
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,140
Wait, I only have a hundred photos I can take.

1091
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,480
I don't know!

1092
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,240
I wish I could see him.

1093
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:51,610
Different angle?

1094
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:52,250
I'll try.

1095
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,050
Let's go through here first.

1096
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,290
Look at them go.

1097
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:04,970
One of my favorite photos is in here, you guys.

1098
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,010
In that room, so...

1099
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,330
I can't wait to show you.

1100
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,170
I can't wait to show you.

1101
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,480
Oh, I don't want to go in yet.

1102
01:01:18,580 --> 01:01:18,960
Just kidding.

1103
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,840
No, we won't be going in through this way.

1104
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:22,240
Don't worry.

1105
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,580
I'll be heading back outside.

1106
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,040
But I want to get Miller first!

1107
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:32,640
I wish I had the sorrow doll.

1108
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,500
Maybe from here, you think?

1109
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:43,480
Look at all the rats.

1110
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,600
I'm scared of not having enough...

1111
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,880
I think that counts!

1112
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:53,840
He was stuck in the ceiling.

1113
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,220
Metal Gear Snap.

1114
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,580
Okay, we can leave.

1115
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,480
Look, it's not even like a load.

1116
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:09,940
It's all one place.

1117
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:10,680
It's so crazy.

1118
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,940
I'll check under the truck.

1119
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,360
I know you guys want me to.

1120
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,380
I got you.

1121
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:18,040
Just like old times.

1122
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:20,720
Yay!

1123
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:22,320
I sold it!

1124
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,120
I sold it for cold hard cash!

1125
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:32,560
I took your nostalgia and I made 5000 DP off of it!

1126
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,200
How do you feel about that?

1127
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:41,980
And I believe those are all the photos from the heliport.

1128
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:45,740
We got Master Miller.

1129
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:49,420
And then I know where the next three are.

1130
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,330
Yes, I know where the next three are.

1131
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:56,350
In the hangar.

1132
01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:00,410
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1133
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:04,810
Hold on.

1134
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,390
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I got all of them.

1135
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:11,850
If you get all of them, for people who are wondering...

1136
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:15,650
I'm pretty sure you get a DP boost.

1137
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,750
MSG gone.

1138
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:26,510
Change the camera view!

1139
01:03:26,690 --> 01:03:27,650
Yes, thank you!

1140
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,450
What was it?

1141
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:31,250
Oops.

1142
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:32,150
How do you do it again?

1143
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,540
How do you tilt up?

1144
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:46,060
Oh my god.

1145
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:47,940
It's like a cavern.

1146
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:51,420
It's like a giant crevasse.

1147
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:01,120
Come on Snake, say the line!

1148
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:02,900
Say the line, Snake!

1149
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,300
Say the line, Snake!

1150
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,480
Overhead view.

1151
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,500
That's more like it.

1152
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:26,960
Overhead view.

1153
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:27,940
Yeah.

1154
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:30,000
Just like old times.

1155
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:31,300
Overhead view.

1156
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,220
Yay, thank you Snake.

1157
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,400
And thanks for the money.

1158
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,640
Oops, I don't know why I just did that.

1159
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:37,940
Okay.

1160
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:42,500
Alright, I'm gonna have to be super fast here.

1161
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:43,240
Wait a second.

1162
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,540
Let me double check.

1163
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,720
I think I know where my favorite one is, but...

1164
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,360
Okay.

1165
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,120
If you aim, it's so calm.

1166
01:04:58,740 --> 01:04:59,060
Really?

1167
01:04:59,360 --> 01:04:59,880
Let's try.

1168
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,400
We'll switch it out.

1169
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:06,560
We'll...

1170
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:09,820
We will...

1171
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:13,580
Sorry.

1172
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,220
We'll put it back in.

1173
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,380
Do I?

1174
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:21,910
Which one is it?

1175
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:25,830
23.

1176
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,350
Oh, I see it.

1177
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:32,490
I'm not used to... I'm not used to what it looks like...

1178
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:34,630
Without the... What's it called?

1179
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,910
The suppressor on it.

1180
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,330
Oh, wrong one.

1181
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:41,770
Sorry.

1182
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:43,390
I'm all over the place today.

1183
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:43,830
My goodness.

1184
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,790
I'm all over the place today.

1185
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:50,490
I'm sorry guys.

1186
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:51,710
Okay.

1187
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,960
Just like old times.

1188
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:02,220
Oh, let me switch.

1189
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:06,260
We'll be fine.

1190
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,440
Look at them roll!

1191
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:10,920
Look at them go!

1192
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:27,840
Wait!

1193
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,300
Shut...

1194
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:45,380
Camera!

1195
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:51,020
Favorite picture!

1196
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:51,560
No!

1197
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,060
Where is he?

1198
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,680
Where is he?

1199
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,120
Where is he?

1200
01:06:58,440 --> 01:06:59,440
Where are you?

1201
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,480
Guys...

1202
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,520
I couldn't get it.

1203
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:10,660
I couldn't get my favorite one.

1204
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,820
Where I can see ya.

1205
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,620
There is one up here though.

1206
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,320
It's the DARPA chief!

1207
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:24,860
Oh no!

1208
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:25,840
My favorite one!

1209
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:29,340
I tried!

1210
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:32,680
I wanna get my favorite!

1211
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,260
I only have a limited... I mean I can always buy more chaff grenades, right?

1212
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,200
How much are they?

1213
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,320
Trebin, you better not be...

1214
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,520
You better... Wait, can you sell them?

1215
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:46,360
Does he sell them?

1216
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,580
Oh gosh.

1217
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:49,540
That's not good.

1218
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,400
Oh, here they are.

1219
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:07,180
I only have so many.

1220
01:08:07,540 --> 01:08:09,080
I only have like...

1221
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,020
Why do they do this to me all the time?

1222
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,280
No!

1223
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,920
You guys, I wanted to take a picture of decoy octopus!

1224
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:20,160
Octopus!

1225
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:26,380
I wanted to take a picture of decoy octopus.

1226
01:08:28,020 --> 01:08:29,660
Top left corner.

1227
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:32,020
Top left.

1228
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,980
I would have to do another chaff grenade though.

1229
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:41,080
Please stop backseating you guys.

1230
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:42,440
Please, please, please.

1231
01:08:42,820 --> 01:08:44,260
I'm playing the game.

1232
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:45,900
Don't...

1233
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,460
I don't know why there are so many backseaters of people telling me what to buy and what to get today.

1234
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,510
Can you kill them?

1235
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,430
I mean, yeah, but like...

1236
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,870
It's kind of annoying, no?

1237
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:12,090
There are so many in here.

1238
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:14,630
Let's see.

1239
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:17,450
If I snipe them... Or not snipe them.

1240
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:18,430
If I...

1241
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:19,790
Let's see.

1242
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:26,280
I don't know why I'm switching everything up today.

1243
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,140
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1244
01:09:28,940 --> 01:09:31,740
If I get them with the suppressor...

1245
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,420
Wouldn't you need chaff anyway?

1246
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,740
I'm basically like...

1247
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:42,280
Basically like these sections.

1248
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,460
They're rolling autobots.

1249
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:47,560
Yes.

1250
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:51,700
Oh yeah, see?

1251
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,580
They're too scary.

1252
01:09:58,260 --> 01:09:59,020
They're so scary.

1253
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,180
Andrangos, thanks for the 20 gifts.

1254
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,960
Did I get the one near the tank?

1255
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,240
Yep.

1256
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,960
I got it really, really...

1257
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,320
Oh my gosh.

1258
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,220
Go

1259
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:10,390
over, then aim for the neck.

1260
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:11,870
I got him.

1261
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:14,790
Aim for what?

1262
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:19,390
I need more bullets though.

1263
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:22,090
What does this take?

1264
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:25,730
What do you use?

1265
01:11:28,690 --> 01:11:29,710
Purchase ammo.

1266
01:11:34,070 --> 01:11:34,790
Pricey.

1267
01:11:36,210 --> 01:11:37,050
Thank you.

1268
01:11:38,450 --> 01:11:40,090
I need more bullets.

1269
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:41,030
Thank you.

1270
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,850
Now Otacon is backseating.

1271
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:43,430
I know.

1272
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:46,210
But that guy is always backseating.

1273
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:48,770
What do I do about decoy octopus?

1274
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:49,830
You know what?

1275
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:55,050
Oh gosh, this area, I don't know like any of where the...

1276
01:11:55,630 --> 01:11:57,170
I think I'm gonna give up, you guys.

1277
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,590
I'm not gonna have enough camera.

1278
01:11:58,970 --> 01:12:01,090
I'm not gonna have enough film.

1279
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:03,390
I only have 60 more shots.

1280
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:05,310
And if I mess up again...

1281
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,510
There is a lot of places.

1282
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:09,670
A lot of places.

1283
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,320
Snakes don't belong in Alaska.

1284
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,620
This is where we fight Vulcan Raven.

1285
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:30,960
Sad.

1286
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,320
Is there anything else around here?

1287
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:39,220
Or am I crazy?

1288
01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:42,880
I think there was one above this rock and there is one over there.

1289
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,260
If I had the sorrow doll, I would be much more confident about it, but...

1290
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:50,600
Crazy to think how small this little field is.

1291
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:52,620
Right?

1292
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:56,280
What's up here?

1293
01:12:58,930 --> 01:12:59,670
Thank you.

1294
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,340
There might be an iPod song.

1295
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,960
I think I got it, right?

1296
01:13:08,740 --> 01:13:10,420
I think I already got it.

1297
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:19,210
Game makes you realize how tiny Shadow Moses is.

1298
01:13:19,210 --> 01:13:23,210
When you don't have the load times in between and...

1299
01:13:29,730 --> 01:13:33,530
Who are you?

1300
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:36,470
Fans.

1301
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:40,750
Deep Throat!

1302
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:44,350
Deep Throat.

1303
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:45,930
Deep Throat.

1304
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:50,290
Wow!

1305
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:53,490
Twin Peaks!

1306
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:05,790
Sorry, decoy octopus.

1307
01:14:06,030 --> 01:14:06,730
I tried.

1308
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,030
I really wanted to show you guys.

1309
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:09,950
There is a picture of decoy octopus.

1310
01:14:10,410 --> 01:14:11,050
I have to.

1311
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,830
It's like my favorite guy.

1312
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:15,070
Get in there.

1313
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,780
I know there is a photo.

1314
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,860
I'll get some of the ones that I remember though, that I like.

1315
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:26,560
There is a couple that I like.

1316
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:27,900
This is so fun.

1317
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,860
Like I remember up here.

1318
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,600
There is this one.

1319
01:14:37,820 --> 01:14:38,680
I think it's here.

1320
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,300
It's like a pair of super freaky eyes.

1321
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:43,760
Look at it.

1322
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:47,400
Where did he go?

1323
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:49,940
See him?

1324
01:14:55,450 --> 01:14:57,190
There is a restaurant called Twin Peaks.

1325
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:58,590
Yeah, I've always wanted to go.

1326
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:01,270
I've never been.

1327
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:05,810
There is no fellas in here, right?

1328
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,050
I don't think so.

1329
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:12,050
Oh, I remember there is a guy.

1330
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:15,990
I don't know why I'm still trying.

1331
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:17,090
I still want to try.

1332
01:15:20,330 --> 01:15:20,770
Hello.

1333
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:25,890
I don't see any enemies around here.

1334
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:27,590
Yeah.

1335
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:43,350
I want to go.

1336
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:47,150
I want to go to the commander's office.

1337
01:15:54,110 --> 01:15:54,790
Are you alright, Snake?

1338
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:57,630
You are sure huffing and puffing a lot.

1339
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,370
There is something tiny there.

1340
01:16:03,610 --> 01:16:09,090
There is a warhead storage facility friend right here.

1341
01:16:10,730 --> 01:16:12,310
He is just doing his rounds.

1342
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:15,790
See him?

1343
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,650
Did you see it?

1344
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:20,490
He is old, man.

1345
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:22,250
I know.

1346
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:24,970
I know.

1347
01:16:25,930 --> 01:16:27,310
Related Happy Valentine's Mito!

1348
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,150
Hope you were able to get a bunch of chocolate on sale.

1349
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:31,970
Could you please tell us...

1350
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:33,950
You tolerate us?

1351
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,090
Everybody...

1352
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:49,150
I tolerate you.

1353
01:16:51,590 --> 01:16:55,910
And I'll tolerate you for the rest of my afterlife.

1354
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:11,350
Oh no, I can't open.

1355
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:15,870
We got the fam.

1356
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:19,130
She tolerates us.

1357
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:22,350
I wish there was a good place I could put myself so you could see everything.

1358
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:25,090
There is just so much going on in this UI, you know?

1359
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:26,390
Pipi!

1360
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:37,020
Thank you, thank you!

1361
01:17:58,940 --> 01:17:59,480
Yep!

1362
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,660
You're making him throw up!

1363
01:18:13,620 --> 01:18:17,000
Why won't you...

1364
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,980
Otacon, tell me at the computer!

1365
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:25,300
48273 Otacon!

1366
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,280
Rude!

1367
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,900
Thank you!

1368
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:44,420
Okay!

1369
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:48,180
I never noticed that you can see through here.

1370
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:50,760
There is like even more in there.

1371
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:52,740
Wow, we never go in there before.

1372
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:56,500
48273 I'm not good with numbers, you guys.

1373
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:59,080
I think I have a dic-calcula.

1374
01:19:00,380 --> 01:19:01,460
Whatever it's called.

1375
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,600
Look, you can see it in here too!

1376
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,080
Is this thing safe?

1377
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,460
I can't believe they won't even let you go to B1.

1378
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,080
Actually, while we're in here...

1379
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,340
Oh, that's the wrong thing.

1380
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:43,840
Camouflage.

1381
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:45,840
I will put on...

1382
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,080
I will put on...

1383
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,340
No, what am I doing?

1384
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:52,600
Face, there we go.

1385
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,580
Should we do young or should we do MGS1?

1386
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,240
Second floor basement.

1387
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:03,720
Which one should we do?

1388
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:04,820
MGS1?

1389
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,720
Okay, MGS1 is resounding.

1390
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,400
Resounding fanfare.

1391
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,300
Campbell.

1392
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,900
So cursed, the Campbell.

1393
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:21,460
Look, I did that!

1394
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,960
I did this.

1395
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,320
That was me.

1396
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:34,700
I did that and then I could go over here and I could listen.

1397
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:37,700
I could say...I could say...

1398
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:38,560
Otacon!

1399
01:20:40,660 --> 01:20:42,140
Sky, welcome to my motion!

1400
01:20:42,440 --> 01:20:42,860
Thank you!

1401
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:45,220
Oh, I did not even see that.

1402
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:45,820
Oh my goodness.

1403
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,990
This place is...

1404
01:20:57,870 --> 01:21:00,230
It looks so trashed.

1405
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,110
Because of me.

1406
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:05,870
There's even little rats.

1407
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:08,190
Hello?

1408
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:13,670
Everything looks exactly like I remember it.

1409
01:21:14,170 --> 01:21:16,130
Except for that wall way in back anyway.

1410
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:20,350
I still can't believe how much damage you caused in such a small space.

1411
01:21:23,810 --> 01:21:25,150
Look at him.

1412
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:28,310
Look at him with this little fist on his face.

1413
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:29,470
Reminiscing.

1414
01:21:30,130 --> 01:21:31,530
Otacon, you're not wearing glasses.

1415
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:32,110
Please.

1416
01:21:32,470 --> 01:21:33,850
You're embarrassing yourself.

1417
01:21:34,350 --> 01:21:35,910
Didn't make much of a bang, huh?

1418
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:37,150
Hardly.

1419
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:39,030
Switchboard is still intact.

1420
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:40,510
You're right.

1421
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:44,470
The wiring past the switch circuits could still be live.

1422
01:21:44,830 --> 01:21:45,090
Reflex.

1423
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:46,530
Do you guys do that if you wear glasses?

1424
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:50,910
Do you accidentally sometimes push them up when you don't have them?

1425
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:52,570
Phantom glasses.

1426
01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:59,730
I remember getting stuck in an elevator one time and waiting almost an hour to get out of it and now I have a fear of elevators.

1427
01:21:59,810 --> 01:22:01,150
At least Shadow Moses' work.

1428
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:02,410
You do?

1429
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:07,040
I decided that when I go to Japan...

1430
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,680
Wow, what a small little detail.

1431
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:11,860
Did you guys see me kick that?

1432
01:22:12,100 --> 01:22:14,480
Oh my gosh, I'm destroying the documents.

1433
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,260
I'm getting rid of the evidence.

1434
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:21,400
Oh yeah, I guess we could crawl through here, huh?

1435
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:23,820
Um...

1436
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,660
When I go to Japan...

1437
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:35,400
During... In March, since I have the collab cafe and everything...

1438
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:39,440
I will... I will get new glasses.

1439
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:41,540
I've decided.

1440
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,700
When are you leaving for Japan again?

1441
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:46,240
The end of this month.

1442
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,860
I'll only be there for about a week.

1443
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:51,520
So...

1444
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,000
I don't remember where any of the guys... Actually, I do remember there will be one here.

1445
01:22:58,080 --> 01:23:00,560
As for anything else in this hallway, I don't remember.

1446
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:24,190
Freaky...

1447
01:23:26,110 --> 01:23:26,590
Freaky...

1448
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,820
This is like... This hallway is one of my favorite...

1449
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,500
One of my favorite parts of the game.

1450
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,860
What happened to the bodies?

1451
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:48,420
That's so true.

1452
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,720
Maybe the rats ate them.

1453
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:51,040
Probably, right?

1454
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:53,780
I

1455
01:23:57,260 --> 01:23:57,740
did that.

1456
01:23:57,860 --> 01:23:58,360
No, I didn't.

1457
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,880
Hurt me more, Snake!

1458
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:04,120
Bones and all?

1459
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:07,280
Bones and all.

1460
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,180
Oh, shit.

1461
01:24:08,300 --> 01:24:09,020
I forgot the code.

1462
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:13,220
Two, eight, three... No.

1463
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:15,000
Seven, three.

1464
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,600
Seven, two...

1465
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:20,440
Four, eight, seven, two, three.

1466
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:20,940
Thank you.

1467
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:27,470
Four, eight...

1468
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:27,870
Wait.

1469
01:24:28,030 --> 01:24:29,450
Four, eight, two, seven, three.

1470
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:33,950
Okay.

1471
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:41,390
Snake!

1472
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:47,720
Uppies!

1473
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:48,320
Uppies!

1474
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,840
You can use 1-4-8-9-3 for a thousand DPs.

1475
01:25:00,520 --> 01:25:01,980
There's secret codes?

1476
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:02,880
Is that real?

1477
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,140
Snake!

1478
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:04,540
Snake!

1479
01:25:26,940 --> 01:25:29,640
Man has no expressions.

1480
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:34,640
What?

1481
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,380
Don't be a liar, Otacon.

1482
01:25:43,220 --> 01:25:45,260
Wait, Kyoma, is that real?

1483
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:49,540
Are you gonna... Am I getting one guide for real?

1484
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:51,000
Am I getting one guide?

1485
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:51,920
Yes, there's a hidden password.

1486
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,680
I also work on Otacon's computer.

1487
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:56,400
That could either give driven points or iPod songs.

1488
01:25:56,820 --> 01:25:58,460
We need the points.

1489
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:04,670
It's real?

1490
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,250
It's real?

1491
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:08,810
Okay, Kyoma, I'm trusting you with my afterlife right now.

1492
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:11,870
One, four...

1493
01:26:11,870 --> 01:26:13,830
Eight, nine, three...

1494
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:19,830
I didn't want Otacon to think we were old, so I was truly gonna put in the correct number, but...

1495
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,130
iPod songs though.

1496
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,150
It's okay, we can come back and get them.

1497
01:26:30,870 --> 01:26:33,070
That sounded like it gave us some money!

1498
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:36,810
Look at him smiling.

1499
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:40,790
He's like, okay, you got this.

1500
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:53,070
Snake, I think maybe your memory... Don't worry, I'm sure I can remember it.

1501
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:58,950
Is the money worth it?

1502
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:03,450
Is the money worth that cutscene?

1503
01:27:03,570 --> 01:27:04,610
It's so sad.

1504
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:09,250
How did he... I think your memory too, Otacon.

1505
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:11,410
You're literally the one who told us earlier.

1506
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:13,310
I think...

1507
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:16,990
You're the one calling the kettle black, huh?

1508
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:21,710
You're the one!

1509
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:29,710
It's such a shitty cutscene, it makes you feel so bad.

1510
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:34,250
Otacon making us feel bad for no reason.

1511
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:41,270
I forgot too, Snake.

1512
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:43,970
Even though I literally told you five minutes ago.

1513
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:48,030
And I was allegedly the one to... You remembered it!

1514
01:27:48,090 --> 01:27:48,770
I don't understand!

1515
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:55,570
I like how sandy Snake is.

1516
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,130
The stain is still there.

1517
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:06,490
It's my dad's favorite act.

1518
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:14,710
Hot dog, hot dog.

1519
01:28:15,750 --> 01:28:20,130
Zooms in on pee, pee, pee, piss, pee, pee, piss.

1520
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:32,270
Did Otacon have a Playstation game?

1521
01:28:49,370 --> 01:28:51,310
Well, we did not save your pants.

1522
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:06,770
That's why she's such a bitch.

1523
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:12,450
Board Game Error!

1524
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:13,170
Yeah!

1525
01:29:13,330 --> 01:29:14,170
I got mine actually!

1526
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,330
I'm glad you got yours.

1527
01:29:29,310 --> 01:29:30,030
Yeah!

1528
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:58,670
Because she's evil!

1529
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:05,510
She wanted to steal Otacon's body.

1530
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:09,090
Disgusting.

1531
01:30:21,070 --> 01:30:23,470
Why does he look like he's covered in sand?

1532
01:30:24,470 --> 01:30:28,590
It's an image taken a few hours ago by a surveillance camera up ahead.

1533
01:30:31,310 --> 01:30:33,870
Oh my god!

1534
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:36,510
Oh my god!

1535
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:37,770
What a surprise!

1536
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:40,270
He's frosting.

1537
01:30:40,770 --> 01:30:42,850
It would melt though if it were snow.

1538
01:30:43,750 --> 01:30:44,070
Right?

1539
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,890
Oh come on.

1540
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,330
Clean.

1541
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:08,870
Naomi is the beast.

1542
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:09,650
So true!

1543
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:17,390
Check the P-State with the solid I-Infrared on.

1544
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:19,130
Wait, I think I do remember this.

1545
01:31:21,370 --> 01:31:22,890
Level 2!

1546
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:36,130
Every time this song starts my heart aches.

1547
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:51,970
Yeah!

1548
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:54,090
We got the money, money baby!

1549
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:57,030
We got the money honey!

1550
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:00,790
Press X to remember.

1551
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:12,770
My friend.

1552
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:27,230
He should have been killed, but he's still alive.

1553
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:45,890
Are you an Otaku too?

1554
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:49,070
After Zanzibar!

1555
01:32:49,890 --> 01:32:52,590
Look at him heavy breathing as he sees this spot.

1556
01:32:53,790 --> 01:32:55,230
It's okay Snake.

1557
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:05,610
It's like nothing has changed.

1558
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:11,510
No one has vacuumed this spot in 9 years.

1559
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:22,210
It's still wet.

1560
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:24,410
A little compress.

1561
01:33:24,750 --> 01:33:26,270
Actually, let me use the compress.

1562
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,930
Do I still have it in my inventory?

1563
01:33:34,570 --> 01:33:36,090
There we go.

1564
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:39,150
Yeah!

1565
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:42,630
Yeah, he did.

1566
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:46,910
Well, I guess in Twin Snakes he had the GameCube, right?

1567
01:33:49,190 --> 01:33:50,010
Let's see.

1568
01:33:51,090 --> 01:33:52,530
I have noodles.

1569
01:33:52,910 --> 01:33:53,990
Right here everybody!

1570
01:33:54,650 --> 01:33:57,650
Are you guys ready to see the man, the myth, the legend?

1571
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:59,410
If I can get it correctly.

1572
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,730
3, 2, 1...

1573
01:34:04,660 --> 01:34:06,420
Did you see it?

1574
01:34:07,140 --> 01:34:08,700
Did you see it?

1575
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,080
There is one I think here.

1576
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,940
I don't remember which one this is though.

1577
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:20,860
Oh!

1578
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,220
It's a...

1579
01:34:22,220 --> 01:34:23,160
Baker.

1580
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:25,840
And then I think there is one here.

1581
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:27,880
See, I told you guys.

1582
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:28,800
I really...

1583
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:29,920
Ah, I got it.

1584
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:32,460
I did try really hard to remember these.

1585
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:33,520
I really did.

1586
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:38,340
Nice.

1587
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:41,740
And that's everything in here.

1588
01:34:42,660 --> 01:34:42,860
Let's go.

1589
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:14,420
This one is kind of spooky.

1590
01:35:17,140 --> 01:35:18,400
This one is kind of spooky.

1591
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:18,840
Ready?

1592
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:27,440
Geckos.

1593
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:28,880
We got geckos.

1594
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:33,820
I don't know who that is.

1595
01:35:33,820 --> 01:35:36,640
It's maybe one of the beauties.

1596
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:40,480
Maybe a raging raven or... I don't know actually.

1597
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:41,440
Spooky lady.

1598
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:43,160
Okay, now we go.

1599
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:47,260
Wife?

1600
01:35:48,340 --> 01:35:48,660
Who?

1601
01:35:48,980 --> 01:35:49,020
Yours?

1602
01:35:51,260 --> 01:35:52,320
It's my wife.

1603
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,400
Don't worry about it.

1604
01:35:54,140 --> 01:35:56,840
You know, she was just super important in this game.

1605
01:35:56,840 --> 01:35:56,960
Okay.

1606
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:03,620
Oh my gosh!

1607
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,320
Kojima is gone!

1608
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:06,480
Welcome to Mambushu!

1609
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:07,280
Thank you!

1610
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:09,700
That's so funny.

1611
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:13,960
Okay.

1612
01:36:17,080 --> 01:36:17,600
Okay.

1613
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:20,360
Oh, from here?

1614
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,660
I'm kind of nervous about these rooms.

1615
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:23,260
I'm not gonna lie.

1616
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,840
I'm not gonna worry about the camera because...

1617
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,440
It's kind of...

1618
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:34,990
It's gonna get a little messy for me maybe.

1619
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:05,170
I got it.

1620
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,070
Uh...

1621
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:19,020
I told you man.

1622
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,200
Getting this gun was like the best purchase.

1623
01:37:23,240 --> 01:37:27,180
Getting this gun is absolutely insane.

1624
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:28,360
I told you.

1625
01:37:28,480 --> 01:37:30,500
You need it for the geckos.

1626
01:37:30,620 --> 01:37:35,260
It's absolutely just craziness.

1627
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,600
Instantly pays for itself.

1628
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:42,660
That's what I'm saying.

1629
01:37:44,980 --> 01:37:46,120
Speedrun gun.

1630
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:47,800
Yeah, for real.

1631
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:53,620
Snowfield and communications tower.

1632
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:55,700
Was there anything...

1633
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:00,370
Any ghosts here?

1634
01:38:00,430 --> 01:38:01,030
I don't remember.

1635
01:38:02,230 --> 01:38:05,030
Actually, I don't think I remember.

1636
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,090
Tower.

1637
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,050
I'm full on so many things.

1638
01:38:11,170 --> 01:38:12,650
I wish I could at least sell them for money.

1639
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:17,010
No,

1640
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:26,770
that's not what... There we go.

1641
01:38:28,510 --> 01:38:29,850
We won't need this for now.

1642
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:33,910
Where is my...

1643
01:38:35,950 --> 01:38:36,810
Twin barrel.

1644
01:38:37,390 --> 01:38:38,910
We're going all...

1645
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:43,090
And I think... I can't believe these are still ID locked.

1646
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:52,290
Yeah, we'll just... I don't want to use my... I don't want to accidentally use it.

1647
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:54,590
I don't think I would accidentally use it, but you know what I mean.

1648
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,350
Oh, it's only 8 DP.

1649
01:38:59,350 --> 01:38:59,730
Boy.

1650
01:39:03,010 --> 01:39:04,550
Wait, I should unlock these.

1651
01:39:04,870 --> 01:39:05,750
Why haven't I yet?

1652
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:08,630
Yeah, why not unlock them?

1653
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:12,050
A lot of the other things I don't really need, you know.

1654
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:13,930
The javelin is insane.

1655
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:17,230
Holy moly!

1656
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:18,470
Look at that thing!

1657
01:39:18,890 --> 01:39:20,630
Oh my gosh, how am I supposed to carry that?

1658
01:39:21,850 --> 01:39:26,630
But I feel like with the... With these, I think they're fine to...

1659
01:39:28,130 --> 01:39:32,630
Okay, I don't know if I'll use that, but...

1660
01:39:35,390 --> 01:39:36,270
Javelin indoors.

1661
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:41,410
The doll is easy to find this time.

1662
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:42,050
It is!

1663
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:48,570
I feel like it would be the opposite, because it's so... I can barely see anything!

1664
01:39:49,270 --> 01:39:50,130
I am, though.

1665
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:51,230
I am going to switch.

1666
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:52,810
Sorry, everybody.

1667
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:56,670
We're switching back to Old Snake.

1668
01:39:58,150 --> 01:40:03,710
If you went to the area with the dwarf geckos, you could get the song from Zone of the Enders 2, Beyond the Bounds.

1669
01:40:06,110 --> 01:40:08,290
The area with the dwarf geckos.

1670
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:11,070
The first area?

1671
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:14,110
The hangar?

1672
01:40:18,190 --> 01:40:19,370
The tank?

1673
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:27,930
I don't remember if I grabbed it before.

1674
01:40:30,310 --> 01:40:32,350
We've gotten the thermal goggles yet.

1675
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:39,750
I know there's a way to cheese this fight, where you can go to an area...

1676
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:40,630
Sorry for everyone.

1677
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:43,290
We're about to do a boss fight, if you couldn't tell.

1678
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:52,290
It's just crazy that you fight two snipers here.

1679
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:56,350
But if you have ammo for the shotgun...

1680
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:59,570
If not, I can always buy it during the fight.

1681
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:00,070
It's no problem.

1682
01:41:02,330 --> 01:41:04,350
Yeah, it's like zero.

1683
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,170
It's okay.

1684
01:41:05,270 --> 01:41:07,390
I think we'll be using the Mosin mostly.

1685
01:41:10,310 --> 01:41:12,950
But I don't remember what area you go to cheese it.

1686
01:41:15,190 --> 01:41:16,770
I don't remember.

1687
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:18,610
Oh well.

1688
01:41:28,240 --> 01:41:32,400
Those nostalgic doggy cries.

1689
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:42,320
So recently... I don't know what it is, but I've recently been wanting a dog.

1690
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:44,940
Which I'm not a dog person at all.

1691
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,440
But just a little bit.

1692
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:48,340
I've been watching some dog videos.

1693
01:41:48,540 --> 01:41:51,580
And I saw a video the other day of a dog and a cat getting along.

1694
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:56,120
A dog does not fit my afterlife style at all.

1695
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,920
But I've kind of just been wanting a dog.

1696
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:04,790
Big dog or little dog?

1697
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:06,570
Like a medium sized dog.

1698
01:42:08,570 --> 01:42:10,530
I probably won't get one.

1699
01:42:11,010 --> 01:42:13,370
But this is like a lot of work having a dog.

1700
01:42:16,450 --> 01:42:16,970
But...

1701
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:18,850
Of course I would name him D-Dog.

1702
01:42:19,250 --> 01:42:20,010
Like a hundred percent.

1703
01:42:20,610 --> 01:42:21,130
Stop!

1704
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:23,370
Don't do that right now.

1705
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:26,390
I will have to possess you.

1706
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:36,210
Chihuahua?

1707
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:39,090
No, not a Chihuahua.

1708
01:42:41,290 --> 01:42:42,250
That's me.

1709
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:43,650
That's me in this game.

1710
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:47,930
Absolute me.

1711
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:52,790
No, don't do that.

1712
01:43:12,820 --> 01:43:15,430
Would your dog and dad be friends?

1713
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:15,570
Friends.

1714
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:20,530
Sad lady.

1715
01:43:22,330 --> 01:43:23,070
No, no!

1716
01:43:23,870 --> 01:43:24,550
Oh, snake.

1717
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:25,110
Not the time.

1718
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:25,910
Oh, no.

1719
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:27,190
Oh, snake.

1720
01:43:28,710 --> 01:43:29,870
Not the time, snake.

1721
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:31,430
Snake, I need you to...

1722
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,110
Cry for me.

1723
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:48,610
How many wolves does she have inside her?

1724
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,930
Oh,

1725
01:43:59,150 --> 01:43:59,670
snake.

1726
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:06,070
I think having that big metal ring on your back really doesn't help with the...

1727
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:09,450
With the impact, you know?

1728
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:11,630
That thing probably hurts a ton.

1729
01:44:15,770 --> 01:44:16,530
Oh, I'm crying.

1730
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:19,050
Oh, I'm crying.

1731
01:44:29,570 --> 01:44:31,470
You guys, I forgot to show you something.

1732
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,210
I'll show you later.

1733
01:44:37,270 --> 01:44:38,670
Or what if I just did it right now?

1734
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:41,730
Oh my god, there's geckos too?

1735
01:44:42,150 --> 01:44:43,530
Wait, I forgot.

1736
01:44:43,690 --> 01:44:44,790
Not geckos, froggies.

1737
01:44:54,250 --> 01:44:55,170
And die.

1738
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:57,170
Okay,

1739
01:45:01,720 --> 01:45:02,020
baby.

1740
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:05,620
Let's get rid of this M4.

1741
01:45:05,940 --> 01:45:06,820
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1742
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:08,540
Goodbye, goodbye.

1743
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:10,100
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1744
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,140
Switch it out for...

1745
01:45:13,200 --> 01:45:13,680
MK2.

1746
01:45:13,980 --> 01:45:15,120
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1747
01:45:21,610 --> 01:45:22,970
Sorry for night vision.

1748
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:34,720
What do you mean, what?

1749
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,480
What do you mean, what?

1750
01:45:48,250 --> 01:45:49,390
Is that her?

1751
01:45:49,650 --> 01:45:49,910
Wait.

1752
01:45:51,010 --> 01:45:51,810
Who is that?

1753
01:45:54,330 --> 01:45:55,310
How do you know?

1754
01:46:02,670 --> 01:46:03,790
Did they wake up?

1755
01:46:04,810 --> 01:46:05,830
Oh, I have no more ammo.

1756
01:46:15,940 --> 01:46:17,640
Trying to get these guys out first.

1757
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:37,370
Reload.

1758
01:46:38,850 --> 01:46:40,110
God, there's so many of them.

1759
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:44,290
There's so many of them.

1760
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:50,910
Trying to take care of them first.

1761
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,630
I don't know if I can get her from there.

1762
01:46:57,930 --> 01:46:58,810
Will they wake up?

1763
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:00,210
I'm scared.

1764
01:47:01,470 --> 01:47:03,190
Should I be killing them instead?

1765
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:06,850
I hear her.

1766
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:08,310
I hear her too.

1767
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:09,050
It's kind of spooky.

1768
01:47:09,050 --> 01:47:09,150
Spooky.

1769
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:14,090
Eventually...

1770
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:14,350
Boo!

1771
01:47:14,910 --> 01:47:15,150
No!

1772
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:16,390
Okay.

1773
01:47:19,830 --> 01:47:21,510
Where is she anyway?

1774
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:22,850
Ma'am?

1775
01:47:32,410 --> 01:47:34,070
What are you crying at?

1776
01:47:47,510 --> 01:47:48,390
Oh my god.

1777
01:47:48,590 --> 01:47:49,430
What the hell?

1778
01:47:49,450 --> 01:47:50,390
I'm getting hijacked?

1779
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:52,590
That didn't help me at all.

1780
01:47:57,150 --> 01:47:57,710
What's happening?

1781
01:48:00,670 --> 01:48:01,190
Stop!

1782
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:02,670
Stop hijacking me!

1783
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:03,770
Oh my god, she's so close.

1784
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:14,530
Oh my god!

1785
01:48:15,010 --> 01:48:18,110
Oh my god!

1786
01:48:18,330 --> 01:48:18,890
Oh my god, run!

1787
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,880
Oh my...

1788
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:26,660
That person should be dead.

1789
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:29,080
Holy shit!

1790
01:48:37,860 --> 01:48:40,680
I don't quite remember how to do this fight.

1791
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,820
Like, I hear her everywhere, you know?

1792
01:48:58,350 --> 01:48:59,550
Bad timing.

1793
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:10,940
Wait, who's coming?

1794
01:49:17,710 --> 01:49:18,310
Sorry.

1795
01:49:20,130 --> 01:49:21,310
Screw this fight!

1796
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:25,710
Oh my god.

1797
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:29,930
Where are you?

1798
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:30,610
Oh my gosh.

1799
01:49:31,090 --> 01:49:32,270
How do I get her though?

1800
01:49:33,070 --> 01:49:34,110
Holy moly.

1801
01:49:44,810 --> 01:49:46,230
Where did she go?

1802
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:48,670
Oh, there she is right there.

1803
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:13,380
Where'd she go?

1804
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:14,400
Oh, she's running.

1805
01:50:19,650 --> 01:50:20,590
Nice shot, really?

1806
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,330
No,

1807
01:50:26,210 --> 01:50:26,370
no!

1808
01:50:26,630 --> 01:50:26,950
Please!

1809
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:28,650
Please!

1810
01:50:28,870 --> 01:50:29,370
There we go.

1811
01:50:34,770 --> 01:50:35,210
Madam!

1812
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:43,620
We did get some good damage with that one shot though.

1813
01:50:44,280 --> 01:50:47,080
So if I can just do that a couple times, we'll be alright.

1814
01:50:47,820 --> 01:50:48,260
Right?

1815
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:50,620
Yeah!

1816
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:54,520
Oh no, they're waking up.

1817
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,340
You can see them.

1818
01:50:55,740 --> 01:50:56,600
Starting to get up.

1819
01:51:13,450 --> 01:51:14,590
Where is she?

1820
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,170
Good shot, thank you.

1821
01:51:23,070 --> 01:51:24,630
I wish these guys would just

1822
01:51:28,300 --> 01:51:29,000
go...

1823
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,080
Oh my gosh, stop!

1824
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,220
Stop waking them up!

1825
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:34,820
I wish I could tell where she was.

1826
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:38,620
Oh my god, no!

1827
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:53,030
This camouflage.

1828
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:55,750
Maybe I should become more camouflaged.

1829
01:51:58,650 --> 01:52:00,350
Now it's only negative five.

1830
01:52:03,250 --> 01:52:06,090
How can you see me in this snowstorm?

1831
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:13,900
Where is she?

1832
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,820
Yep.

1833
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:20,880
I hear something moving, but...

1834
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:21,440
Oh, there she is!

1835
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:26,230
Damn it!

1836
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:37,920
I'm out of ammo, I think.

1837
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:41,320
What does it take?

1838
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,520
Wait, what does it take?

1839
01:52:47,340 --> 01:52:48,460
Can I just get the...

1840
01:52:48,460 --> 01:52:50,240
No, this is...

1841
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:52,720
Hold on.

1842
01:52:54,040 --> 01:52:54,880
I'll find it.

1843
01:52:56,380 --> 01:52:57,320
Did I pass it?

1844
01:52:57,800 --> 01:52:59,060
There we go.

1845
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:01,520
Any of these?

1846
01:53:03,800 --> 01:53:05,680
We'll just get the normal ones.

1847
01:53:06,920 --> 01:53:09,880
Yeah, we'll just get the normal ones.

1848
01:53:10,380 --> 01:53:10,920
Should be okay.

1849
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:15,760
Like twenty...

1850
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:17,140
Pieces?

1851
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:18,440
Should be okay.

1852
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:35,850
Oh my god.

1853
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,210
Did I not...

1854
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:39,270
Oh, okay, we did do damage.

1855
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:40,110
I was about to say.

1856
01:53:40,590 --> 01:53:40,830
Hello?

1857
01:53:41,650 --> 01:53:42,470
Oh my gosh.

1858
01:53:43,110 --> 01:53:43,930
It's not a good hiding.

1859
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:45,850
It's not a good hiding spot.

1860
01:53:47,310 --> 01:53:48,110
Oh gosh.

1861
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:48,850
Please.

1862
01:53:49,750 --> 01:53:50,430
Good night.

1863
01:53:51,970 --> 01:53:52,390
Hey, who?

1864
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:53,730
Hey, you!

1865
01:53:55,630 --> 01:53:56,310
Hey, you!

1866
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:01,280
Please.

1867
01:54:01,420 --> 01:54:02,340
Please go to sleep.

1868
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:03,540
Thank you.

1869
01:54:07,460 --> 01:54:09,000
Please go to sleep.

1870
01:54:14,810 --> 01:54:17,490
Even with those helmets on, you can hear him snoring.

1871
01:54:20,630 --> 01:54:21,450
Is that her?

1872
01:54:21,650 --> 01:54:21,910
Yes.

1873
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:24,940
Oh my gosh, that's a pretty far shot, but...

1874
01:54:30,530 --> 01:54:31,630
Is it too far?

1875
01:54:32,350 --> 01:54:33,290
Okay, let me keep going.

1876
01:54:35,050 --> 01:54:36,010
Caution from who?

1877
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:46,800
Bullet drop.

1878
01:54:59,170 --> 01:55:00,310
Oh, come on.

1879
01:55:00,670 --> 01:55:01,430
I saw you.

1880
01:55:02,290 --> 01:55:03,410
I saw your head.

1881
01:55:10,220 --> 01:55:11,350
And they're gone.

1882
01:55:18,390 --> 01:55:19,190
Oh god.

1883
01:55:19,670 --> 01:55:19,990
Oh god.

1884
01:55:20,530 --> 01:55:21,090
Oh god.

1885
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:22,410
Oh god!

1886
01:55:22,950 --> 01:55:23,450
Oh god!

1887
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:28,770
She's on this side.

1888
01:55:31,990 --> 01:55:33,050
She's over here.

1889
01:55:34,990 --> 01:55:36,030
Damn it!

1890
01:55:36,570 --> 01:55:37,310
I didn't hear it.

1891
01:55:37,730 --> 01:55:39,050
I didn't hear it rev up.

1892
01:55:39,650 --> 01:55:43,450
Can I kill her here?

1893
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:44,890
That would be so great.

1894
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,350
Does she know where I am?

1895
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:50,010
Okay, I'm high...

1896
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:52,990
I'm high stealth now.

1897
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,050
She's on the walls!

1898
01:56:04,050 --> 01:56:05,150
She's on the walls!

1899
01:56:07,570 --> 01:56:08,450
Okay, hold on.

1900
01:56:08,450 --> 01:56:09,430
Let me get my ration.

1901
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:16,490
Come on, Snake, get up!

1902
01:56:17,310 --> 01:56:17,890
We're fine!

1903
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:29,940
Oh shoot.

1904
01:56:32,780 --> 01:56:33,600
No, it's not.

1905
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:40,600
Okay, let's go find her again.

1906
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:45,000
If she would just stay still.

1907
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:46,860
That flip though.

1908
01:56:46,980 --> 01:56:47,420
I know.

1909
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:54,880
I can't tell.

1910
01:56:56,860 --> 01:56:59,580
No, you didn't.

1911
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:17,510
I don't know where she is.

1912
01:57:18,750 --> 01:57:19,670
Can I get a hint?

1913
01:57:22,870 --> 01:57:24,590
Wait, no, that's not her.

1914
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:25,530
Wait, yes it is.

1915
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:31,110
Nice.

1916
01:57:31,810 --> 01:57:32,910
Alright, we're close.

1917
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,540
Something just what?

1918
01:57:47,320 --> 01:57:47,640
What?

1919
01:57:48,100 --> 01:57:49,860
What did something just do?

1920
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:55,700
Nothing, just nothing.

1921
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:57,620
Yeah, just your imagination.

1922
01:58:00,780 --> 01:58:02,720
I can see so well.

1923
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,040
You're so scary.

1924
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:07,940
Oh shoot.

1925
01:58:08,640 --> 01:58:10,680
I think that lady is gonna...

1926
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:10,900
No?

1927
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:11,680
Maybe not.

1928
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:12,000
Okay.

1929
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,880
Oh, yep, she is.

1930
01:58:15,180 --> 01:58:16,200
Whatever, it's fine.

1931
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,220
Don't worry about it.

1932
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:19,300
Must have been the wind.

1933
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,140
Just the wind!

1934
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,520
Let's go find her.

1935
01:58:24,660 --> 01:58:26,640
I think maybe like two more?

1936
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:28,380
One if I'm lucky.

1937
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:30,120
One if I'm really good.

1938
01:58:30,180 --> 01:58:31,720
If I get like a good headshot, I think.

1939
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:36,300
I hear her panting.

1940
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:39,840
Who saw me?

1941
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,720
What do you mean that sound?

1942
01:58:42,860 --> 01:58:43,640
Oh, there she is.

1943
01:58:47,910 --> 01:58:48,970
Got her!

1944
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,140
I love slime girls!

1945
01:59:05,560 --> 01:59:07,080
And slimy girls.

1946
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:08,940
She didn't notice.

1947
01:59:13,760 --> 01:59:17,260
Why couldn't this be the terrain we were playing in, huh?

1948
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:26,380
Madam, your rump is...

1949
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:31,980
It's mightier than these hills we've been fighting on.

1950
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:39,620
Oh, yeah!

1951
01:59:41,560 --> 01:59:42,760
Oh, yeah!

1952
01:59:49,510 --> 01:59:51,390
A tiny little gun snake.

1953
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:55,530
The trophy first, yes.

1954
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:55,950
Thank you.

1955
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:01,170
Oh, no!

1956
02:00:01,390 --> 02:00:03,390
She has babies!

1957
02:00:06,270 --> 02:00:08,250
Oh, I also hear the cries of babies.

1958
02:00:09,350 --> 02:00:09,670
Uh-oh.

1959
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:12,250
Stop it!

1960
02:00:13,030 --> 02:00:14,470
Stop crying!

1961
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:16,610
My cat at 6am.

1962
02:00:18,330 --> 02:00:20,010
Please stop crying!

1963
02:00:22,990 --> 02:00:26,490
My cat when he's crying at 6am to be fed.

1964
02:00:32,470 --> 02:00:34,350
I'm an owl.

1965
02:00:34,470 --> 02:00:34,910
Go away.

1966
02:00:34,990 --> 02:00:35,470
Nevermind.

1967
02:00:38,170 --> 02:00:39,390
Don't come any closer.

1968
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,670
That's me also right before stream.

1969
02:00:43,110 --> 02:00:44,290
Stop crying!

1970
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:47,190
No babies!

1971
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:51,870
Stop getting pregnant!

1972
02:00:52,410 --> 02:00:53,250
No babies!

1973
02:01:09,390 --> 02:01:10,370
I'm sorry.

1974
02:01:16,310 --> 02:01:18,950
Me when I'm one minute late for stream.

1975
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:21,630
Forgive me.

1976
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,190
It's my party.

1977
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:28,990
Cry if you need to.

1978
02:01:57,190 --> 02:01:58,350
She's a dog.

1979
02:01:58,410 --> 02:01:59,590
She's got that dog in her.

1980
02:02:00,570 --> 02:02:01,130
Damn.

1981
02:02:03,710 --> 02:02:04,010
Cat.

1982
02:02:13,820 --> 02:02:14,460
You...

1983
02:02:15,780 --> 02:02:16,420
I...

1984
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:21,100
I...

1985
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:21,460
Oh my gosh.

1986
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:22,440
I can't see anything.

1987
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:23,220
Hold on, lady.

1988
02:02:23,620 --> 02:02:24,560
Where's your statue?

1989
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:25,600
That's a ration.

1990
02:02:27,700 --> 02:02:28,660
That's a...

1991
02:02:28,660 --> 02:02:29,080
Fig...

1992
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:29,520
Oh, figure!

1993
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:31,500
I found it.

1994
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:33,800
Don't worry.

1995
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:35,340
I'll change my gun.

1996
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:37,480
Yeah!

1997
02:02:37,640 --> 02:02:38,920
Crying wolf doll.

1998
02:02:39,680 --> 02:02:40,880
An action figure of crying wolves.

1999
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:42,520
Customized battle suit.

2000
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:45,660
Oh my gosh.

2001
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:46,040
She's fast.

2002
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:49,480
Hold on.

2003
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:50,020
Let me...

2004
02:02:50,020 --> 02:02:52,900
Actually, which gun did it switch out?

2005
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:55,500
Oh, I need to buy more V-Ring.

2006
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:59,420
We'll wait until we get to the special zone.

2007
02:03:00,460 --> 02:03:01,360
Oh gosh!

2008
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:02,480
Why is she so fast?

2009
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:04,160
Stay away from me, lady!

2010
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:09,790
Women scare me!

2011
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:24,920
Keep...

2012
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,740
Yeah, she going.

2013
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:26,980
She's going.

2014
02:03:30,300 --> 02:03:32,620
Yeah, we're getting her to the special zone.

2015
02:03:35,360 --> 02:03:37,240
I feel I should buy...

2016
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:37,500
Hold on.

2017
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:38,980
Before I forget though.

2018
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:40,780
I'm gonna buy...

2019
02:03:40,780 --> 02:03:42,920
I'm going to buy ammo.

2020
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:44,980
So that I don't forget...

2021
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:45,700
What?

2022
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,360
Bullets.

2023
02:03:49,720 --> 02:03:50,600
For my...

2024
02:03:50,600 --> 02:03:51,840
We need the V-Ring.

2025
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:53,980
Wait, did I just pass it?

2026
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:54,520
Yes, I did.

2027
02:03:56,980 --> 02:03:58,020
Let's do...

2028
02:03:59,520 --> 02:04:01,000
Let's do 40.

2029
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:07,920
Look

2030
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,010
at the way she shuffles.

2031
02:04:13,970 --> 02:04:14,990
Hold on.

2032
02:04:15,290 --> 02:04:15,730
I'm not ready.

2033
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:19,930
What was that?

2034
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:23,910
Oh god!

2035
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:28,540
The way she glows.

2036
02:04:28,640 --> 02:04:29,660
She's got that aura.

2037
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:32,660
Stay away from me, crown beauty!

2038
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:34,780
Stay away from me, crown beauty!

2039
02:04:35,160 --> 02:04:36,460
I know she wants me so bad.

2040
02:04:38,440 --> 02:04:40,100
You took out these trees.

2041
02:04:45,800 --> 02:04:47,140
Don't worry, I'm not gonna do anymore.

2042
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:53,410
It's creepy.

2043
02:04:56,570 --> 02:04:57,790
Stay away from me, lady!

2044
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:57,870
Lady!

2045
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:03,630
The way she like shuffles along with her arms.

2046
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:04,770
It's too fun.

2047
02:05:04,910 --> 02:05:05,290
Oh no!

2048
02:05:05,570 --> 02:05:05,870
Oh no!

2049
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,370
Oh no no!

2050
02:05:06,910 --> 02:05:08,390
I need to look where I'm going.

2051
02:05:11,310 --> 02:05:11,870
No!

2052
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:13,730
Not the dog!

2053
02:05:30,500 --> 02:05:32,780
She walks faster than you run.

2054
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,860
I know, she's just built different.

2055
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:37,860
Crying wolf.

2056
02:05:38,940 --> 02:05:39,900
Crying wolf.

2057
02:05:40,080 --> 02:05:41,920
What's your favorite song, lady?

2058
02:05:42,740 --> 02:05:43,800
What do you want to listen to?

2059
02:05:44,980 --> 02:05:45,900
Oh, let me also...

2060
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:49,520
Equip...

2061
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:52,200
My iPod.

2062
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:53,140
Oh, I do have it equipped.

2063
02:05:53,560 --> 02:05:54,200
I'm so smart.

2064
02:06:11,430 --> 02:06:13,870
Sunny chilling in the corner while I'm fighting for my...

2065
02:06:13,870 --> 02:06:14,090
Wait!

2066
02:06:14,170 --> 02:06:14,290
Wait!

2067
02:06:14,530 --> 02:06:14,530
Wait!

2068
02:06:15,450 --> 02:06:16,610
This is scripted.

2069
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,760
I forgot to show you guys...

2070
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:30,540
Oh, I can show you guys now.

2071
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:34,080
Wait, I was gonna show you guys earlier.

2072
02:06:34,520 --> 02:06:35,600
Now that we have a second.

2073
02:06:36,940 --> 02:06:37,340
Ready?

2074
02:06:38,140 --> 02:06:39,840
I have two things to show you.

2075
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:42,980
Because my papa Celia is a genius.

2076
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:44,440
Oh, sorry.

2077
02:06:44,620 --> 02:06:45,400
I didn't mean to do that.

2078
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:48,340
It's gonna be all messed up now.

2079
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:48,740
No!

2080
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:49,800
I messed up my thing.

2081
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:51,020
Okay, that's better.

2082
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:53,560
Okay, ready?

2083
02:06:55,180 --> 02:06:55,980
Number one.

2084
02:06:56,780 --> 02:06:57,640
Dark mode.

2085
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:05,420
Dark mode, dark mode.

2086
02:07:10,110 --> 02:07:11,430
This is so cool.

2087
02:07:13,650 --> 02:07:15,150
And then also number two.

2088
02:07:16,350 --> 02:07:19,030
I'm thinking Miku, Miku.

2089
02:07:19,630 --> 02:07:22,810
I'm thinking Miku, Miku.

2090
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:26,530
I'm thinking Miku, Miku.

2091
02:07:34,670 --> 02:07:36,790
Maybe I'll say this way for the rest of the stream.

2092
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:45,940
Anyway, back to the sex fest.

2093
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:52,460
iPod, music, songs...

2094
02:07:52,460 --> 02:07:54,380
And we're going to...

2095
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:56,620
My favorite.

2096
02:07:56,620 --> 02:07:58,840
Oishi Touhan Seikatsu!

2097
02:08:10,970 --> 02:08:12,870
You wanna pose for me?

2098
02:08:13,150 --> 02:08:13,610
You nervous?

2099
02:08:14,890 --> 02:08:15,850
You wanna pose for me?

2100
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:25,940
Big fan of Mint-kun.

2101
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:29,020
Yeah?

2102
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:32,020
Oh damn, I was too slow.

2103
02:08:33,060 --> 02:08:34,240
I was too slow.

2104
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:39,660
Is it just laughing octopus that does the sexy poses for us?

2105
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:43,220
Damn it, I'm such an idiot.

2106
02:08:44,340 --> 02:08:45,420
There it is!

2107
02:08:46,120 --> 02:08:46,720
Yeah!

2108
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:49,260
Yeah!

2109
02:08:59,910 --> 02:09:00,510
Yeah!

2110
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:08,860
Okay, dance for me.

2111
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:10,460
Dance for me.

2112
02:09:14,280 --> 02:09:14,460
Okay.

2113
02:09:39,390 --> 02:09:39,870
Yeah!

2114
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:46,210
What is this?

2115
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:47,230
This is...

2116
02:09:47,230 --> 02:09:48,010
Metal Gear!

2117
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:51,970
Dark mode.

2118
02:09:52,330 --> 02:09:54,790
Minto Miku kinda hits the floor with the moans in the background.

2119
02:09:55,090 --> 02:09:55,970
Don't say that!

2120
02:09:58,920 --> 02:10:01,220
BB bosses can be killed lethally when they are in beast mode.

2121
02:10:01,320 --> 02:10:03,880
There's no penalty for using lethal on these bosses.

2122
02:10:05,080 --> 02:10:05,900
Only need to...

2123
02:10:05,900 --> 02:10:06,460
No...

2124
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:07,500
No!

2125
02:10:08,780 --> 02:10:11,300
I need to be non-lethal so I can get their statue.

2126
02:10:15,710 --> 02:10:18,130
I need to be non-lethal so I can get their statue.

2127
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:35,780
Holy rumpus.

2128
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:44,500
But I also just wanna be non-lethal because it makes more sense to be non-lethal.

2129
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:46,180
Because they are still alive.

2130
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,280
They become baby mode.

2131
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:51,080
Alright, Rebin.

2132
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:56,500
The real gun.

2133
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:00,120
Oh, I already had it but thank you.

2134
02:11:04,360 --> 02:11:06,440
Alright, everybody get comfortable.

2135
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:10,800
I wonder what Kanjumbo is.

2136
02:11:12,140 --> 02:11:12,640
Nah.

2137
02:11:14,540 --> 02:11:15,440
I hope nothing.

2138
02:11:15,740 --> 02:11:17,000
I want him to be like this naturally.

2139
02:11:18,100 --> 02:11:19,380
Isn't that more interesting?

2140
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,360
If someone is just naturally insane.

2141
02:11:26,600 --> 02:11:28,280
Don't actually go to sleep!

2142
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:32,500
Her baby brother.

2143
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:34,640
I've always wanted a brother.

2144
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:37,440
I've always wanted a baby brother.

2145
02:11:43,880 --> 02:11:45,180
Hatsune Miku?

2146
02:12:00,240 --> 02:12:04,820
If you guys think this is the end of the act, there's more peak incoming.

2147
02:12:07,120 --> 02:12:09,540
There's actually so much more to this act so...

2148
02:12:10,280 --> 02:12:10,980
Don't go!

2149
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:13,420
There's way more left.

2150
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:20,260
Peak incoming.

2151
02:12:20,360 --> 02:12:21,360
We haven't even reached it.

2152
02:12:23,780 --> 02:12:25,400
I think we're about halfway.

2153
02:12:39,100 --> 02:12:50,880
Literally mean it?

2154
02:12:54,040 --> 02:12:55,720
Every stream?

2155
02:13:07,660 --> 02:13:10,260
The wolf.

2156
02:13:14,240 --> 02:13:17,580
Oh my god.

2157
02:13:19,900 --> 02:13:21,940
By one wolf?!

2158
02:13:24,120 --> 02:13:24,960
Oh.

2159
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:32,860
By one lady?

2160
02:13:53,120 --> 02:13:54,800
She was cleansed by you.

2161
02:13:55,400 --> 02:14:00,960
If the cries she heard of children on the battlefield have been silenced, it's because of you.

2162
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:03,720
You ought to be proud.

2163
02:14:05,260 --> 02:14:07,120
Three down, one to go.

2164
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:09,300
All that's left is Mantis.

2165
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,860
But you should know Snake, she's been controlling all the other beasts.

2166
02:14:14,840 --> 02:14:16,520
She's the beast of beasts.

2167
02:14:17,780 --> 02:14:19,300
Don't let her get her hooks in you.

2168
02:14:19,780 --> 02:14:20,480
I won't.

2169
02:14:20,940 --> 02:14:22,220
See you around, Snake.

2170
02:14:22,220 --> 02:14:23,040
See ya!

2171
02:14:23,860 --> 02:14:25,460
There are two wolves inside you.

2172
02:14:25,840 --> 02:14:26,800
One of them is crying.

2173
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:28,620
One of them is...

2174
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:30,020
Is a baby.

2175
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:34,970
Okay.

2176
02:14:34,970 --> 02:14:35,310
Okay.

2177
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:40,990
Watching Minplay, this is like nostalgia inside memories.

2178
02:14:41,190 --> 02:14:42,270
Going back to Zanzibar.

2179
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:43,550
Inside Yuletide.

2180
02:14:45,610 --> 02:14:46,250
CS4.

2181
02:14:52,630 --> 02:14:56,210
One of the memories here is my favorite...

2182
02:14:56,210 --> 02:14:58,590
Probably my favorite line in Metal Gear Solid 1.

2183
02:14:59,190 --> 02:15:01,110
And almost maybe in all of Metal Gear.

2184
02:15:04,970 --> 02:15:05,110
No!

2185
02:15:07,630 --> 02:15:09,210
My little heart!

2186
02:15:10,190 --> 02:15:11,810
It's okay, she's still alive.

2187
02:15:12,230 --> 02:15:13,870
I kept her alive, don't worry, she's still alive.

2188
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:17,790
She's still alive.

2189
02:15:32,330 --> 02:15:33,190
Bye bye.

2190
02:15:35,050 --> 02:15:37,730
Her little toes is dragging in the snow.

2191
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:39,890
She's gonna get frostbite.

2192
02:15:45,290 --> 02:15:46,530
Mark 3, too cute.

2193
02:16:00,450 --> 02:16:01,490
Sorry, sorry.

2194
02:16:06,230 --> 02:16:06,750
Oops.

2195
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:07,870
Oops.

2196
02:16:09,370 --> 02:16:09,750
Oops.

2197
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:15,790
Oh wait, wrong thing.

2198
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:17,650
Weapons.

2199
02:16:21,930 --> 02:16:22,970
Oh gosh.

2200
02:16:24,110 --> 02:16:25,290
For the upcoming fight.

2201
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:29,790
I don't quite remember how to do it, but I know I'm just gonna equip some of this stuff.

2202
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:34,710
In fact, what if I do the shotty, but...

2203
02:16:34,710 --> 02:16:36,270
Not as...

2204
02:16:40,130 --> 02:16:41,490
Not as...

2205
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:42,670
A railgun.

2206
02:16:45,230 --> 02:16:48,690
Even if you're a freak, my Kamiyoshi is a freak.

2207
02:16:49,790 --> 02:16:49,990
Yeah!

2208
02:16:51,250 --> 02:16:52,430
Thanks for the superchat.

2209
02:16:54,350 --> 02:16:56,690
We'll just do it not as a trunk.

2210
02:16:57,930 --> 02:16:59,270
Alright, I believe...

2211
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:03,590
Is it here?

2212
02:17:11,290 --> 02:17:12,770
Did you see her?

2213
02:17:14,890 --> 02:17:16,570
Sniper wolf.

2214
02:17:21,380 --> 02:17:21,720
Hello.

2215
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:25,480
Hi puppy, hi.

2216
02:17:27,060 --> 02:17:28,720
Hi puppy, hi.

2217
02:17:30,860 --> 02:17:32,940
Hi puppy, hi puppy, hi puppy.

2218
02:17:33,980 --> 02:17:35,160
Oh, it's like a pet dog.

2219
02:17:39,250 --> 02:17:40,690
It's so...

2220
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:44,570
I hate kind of exploring this area because it's just...

2221
02:17:44,570 --> 02:17:46,250
Insanely difficult to see.

2222
02:17:47,730 --> 02:17:49,050
Oh, here it is.

2223
02:18:00,390 --> 02:18:01,630
I'll tell you.

2224
02:18:03,030 --> 02:18:03,750
Okay!

2225
02:18:03,750 --> 02:18:03,850
Okay!

2226
02:18:06,290 --> 02:18:06,770
Okay.

2227
02:18:08,930 --> 02:18:11,210
That's one of my favorite lines.

2228
02:18:12,570 --> 02:18:14,650
In almost all of Metal Gear maybe.

2229
02:18:16,530 --> 02:18:17,990
What was she fighting for?

2230
02:18:18,750 --> 02:18:20,370
What am I fighting for?

2231
02:18:20,930 --> 02:18:22,590
What are you fighting for?

2232
02:18:23,890 --> 02:18:26,610
If you make it through this, I'll tell you.

2233
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:28,490
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

2234
02:18:28,710 --> 02:18:30,710
Sorry, we don't want to go to the blast furnace yet.

2235
02:18:30,810 --> 02:18:31,430
Oh, hello dog.

2236
02:18:35,210 --> 02:18:36,750
I love that line.

2237
02:18:37,030 --> 02:18:39,070
It makes me so emo-y.

2238
02:18:40,770 --> 02:18:41,510
Emotional.

2239
02:18:45,750 --> 02:18:47,370
I can't see shit.

2240
02:18:51,270 --> 02:18:53,370
Is it over there?

2241
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:04,360
I'm gonna be a guest, right?

2242
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:06,840
At MGS Con.

2243
02:19:08,760 --> 02:19:10,200
Happening this year.

2244
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:12,280
And...

2245
02:19:14,380 --> 02:19:17,460
Amanda, the organizer...

2246
02:19:17,460 --> 02:19:19,380
She was like, what do you wanna...

2247
02:19:37,630 --> 02:19:40,230
Did you guys want blue Minto?

2248
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:44,190
Blinto.

2249
02:19:52,790 --> 02:19:53,310
But...

2250
02:19:53,310 --> 02:19:55,830
She was like, is there anything you wanna do?

2251
02:19:56,030 --> 02:19:57,310
Like a panel or something?

2252
02:19:57,550 --> 02:19:59,290
She suggested a...

2253
02:19:59,290 --> 02:20:00,510
Like a karaoke panel.

2254
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:02,870
I was like, that might be fun.

2255
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:05,510
If I do that...

2256
02:20:08,590 --> 02:20:11,750
I was like, okay, I have to learn the best is yet to come.

2257
02:20:11,890 --> 02:20:13,510
I have to actually...

2258
02:20:16,150 --> 02:20:17,590
Learn the language.

2259
02:20:23,210 --> 02:20:24,010
Where is it?

2260
02:20:25,610 --> 02:20:26,290
Hold on.

2261
02:20:28,190 --> 02:20:29,310
How do I zoom out?

2262
02:20:30,330 --> 02:20:30,910
There we go.

2263
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:33,530
Did I pass it?

2264
02:20:33,650 --> 02:20:34,350
It's over that way?

2265
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:36,070
Or is it that...

2266
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:37,550
I think it's that loopy area.

2267
02:20:38,630 --> 02:20:39,290
It's a loop loop.

2268
02:20:41,250 --> 02:20:43,330
But I'm also trying to get some more...

2269
02:20:43,870 --> 02:20:44,950
I'm looting, you know.

2270
02:20:45,990 --> 02:20:47,110
I'm a little loot gab.

2271
02:20:49,430 --> 02:20:52,290
What am I fighting for is ruined for me because of Mega Man.

2272
02:20:52,570 --> 02:20:53,790
It's English dub.

2273
02:20:54,490 --> 02:20:55,670
This is not Mega Man.

2274
02:20:57,410 --> 02:21:00,730
Oh, I

2275
02:21:06,900 --> 02:21:09,900
went the wrong way.

2276
02:21:09,900 --> 02:21:10,760
This way.

2277
02:21:11,020 --> 02:21:11,340
Gosh.

2278
02:21:13,460 --> 02:21:17,420
I know there was stuff up there, but honestly I just don't feel like going all the way up there.

2279
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:24,750
That is not Mega Man.

2280
02:21:37,770 --> 02:21:38,590
The other side.

2281
02:21:49,790 --> 02:21:51,530
Wait, is it over here?

2282
02:21:52,570 --> 02:21:53,650
Can I even get through here?

2283
02:21:59,120 --> 02:21:59,580
Sorry.

2284
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:01,880
Oh my god.

2285
02:22:02,640 --> 02:22:04,260
Okay, I guess it's the other side.

2286
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:06,100
Sorry, I'm looking for the hindy.

2287
02:22:08,720 --> 02:22:10,800
I'm looking for the hindy, you guys.

2288
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,580
Remember, you can find it through here.

2289
02:22:22,350 --> 02:22:24,110
No, but you wish.

2290
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:27,370
You wish, so...

2291
02:22:34,180 --> 02:22:36,600
I just wish it wasn't terrible to see.

2292
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:38,320
I wonder how is the bitrate on this.

2293
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,160
Can you guys even see anything?

2294
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:44,660
Is it impossible for you as well?

2295
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:48,000
It's good?

2296
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:48,380
Really?

2297
02:22:52,200 --> 02:22:54,620
I can't remember where I've checked and not.

2298
02:23:04,210 --> 02:23:05,010
What was that?

2299
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:31,480
Only in MGS1 can you just see it.

2300
02:23:31,480 --> 02:23:33,480
But like, from beyond the wall...

2301
02:23:34,740 --> 02:23:36,300
But here you can go up to it.

2302
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:41,100
I love my little wolf gang.

2303
02:23:42,900 --> 02:23:43,380
Amadeus.

2304
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:45,880
Mozart.

2305
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:47,920
What's down there?

2306
02:23:49,580 --> 02:23:51,060
Oh, that's not what I meant to push.

2307
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:52,120
Sorry.

2308
02:23:54,440 --> 02:23:55,740
Wow, I never...

2309
02:23:56,220 --> 02:23:56,700
What?

2310
02:23:56,720 --> 02:23:58,160
You can make it 3D!

2311
02:23:59,460 --> 02:24:00,640
I didn't know you could do that.

2312
02:24:04,800 --> 02:24:05,320
What?

2313
02:24:06,340 --> 02:24:08,400
I know it literally says it right there.

2314
02:24:08,560 --> 02:24:09,220
Change angle.

2315
02:24:09,700 --> 02:24:10,660
But I didn't know.

2316
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:11,540
Change focus.

2317
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:20,660
But it's a wall.

2318
02:24:20,740 --> 02:24:22,160
We can't get beyond there.

2319
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:24,840
That's so cool.

2320
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:26,240
It shows.

2321
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:28,520
Wait a second.

2322
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:29,120
Was there...

2323
02:24:36,980 --> 02:24:37,980
Was there a hole in...

2324
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:40,900
Oh my god, we went all the way around for no reason.

2325
02:24:42,660 --> 02:24:43,140
Oopsie.

2326
02:24:43,900 --> 02:24:44,940
Alright, we can go now.

2327
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:58,000
Bye dogs!

2328
02:25:05,710 --> 02:25:07,170
Oh, I gotta change the disc.

2329
02:25:20,130 --> 02:25:20,670
Nah.

2330
02:25:29,910 --> 02:25:36,190
Oh my god, I'm so mad.

2331
02:25:41,230 --> 02:25:43,050
The dogs want to come with.

2332
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:43,830
Can I bring them?

2333
02:25:44,970 --> 02:25:46,110
To the blast furnace.

2334
02:25:49,150 --> 02:25:50,130
Damn it.

2335
02:25:54,980 --> 02:25:56,570
He's so grumpy.

2336
02:26:01,880 --> 02:26:04,320
I'm scared of this area, you guys.

2337
02:26:05,160 --> 02:26:05,920
Look at this.

2338
02:26:06,080 --> 02:26:11,540
There's so many little guys around.

2339
02:26:16,650 --> 02:26:19,670
There's too many little guys around.

2340
02:26:20,930 --> 02:26:21,830
Scary.

2341
02:26:25,650 --> 02:26:29,010
This is why I need to have trap grenades.

2342
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:33,990
It's so frosty in the blast furnace now.

2343
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:37,730
I don't think you can even call it a blast furnace.

2344
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:41,790
The music in here is great though.

2345
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:43,790
Wow, look at our camo.

2346
02:26:44,170 --> 02:26:45,070
Look at that.

2347
02:26:45,310 --> 02:26:45,950
Back it up.

2348
02:26:57,110 --> 02:26:57,590
Ration.

2349
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:04,170
Do I not...

2350
02:27:04,170 --> 02:27:05,130
Oh, I'm full on rations?

2351
02:27:05,770 --> 02:27:06,710
I'm too good at this game.

2352
02:27:07,930 --> 02:27:08,330
Yeah!

2353
02:27:12,220 --> 02:27:14,320
I don't think I really need to loot anything in here.

2354
02:27:14,460 --> 02:27:16,840
I don't even remember if there's any...

2355
02:27:16,840 --> 02:27:19,940
I truly don't remember if there's any...

2356
02:27:19,940 --> 02:27:21,480
Is there some ammo down there?

2357
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:24,500
If there's any ghost photos.

2358
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:28,840
But I've already missed so many, so might as well not give it up.

2359
02:27:28,980 --> 02:27:29,440
I give up.

2360
02:27:30,460 --> 02:27:31,040
I give up!

2361
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:38,560
Change my disc.

2362
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:40,800
Oh, not the items.

2363
02:27:43,340 --> 02:27:43,780
Yeah.

2364
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:51,120
I only have three.

2365
02:27:52,020 --> 02:27:52,380
Okay.

2366
02:27:54,960 --> 02:27:56,960
Get the bait ration.

2367
02:27:59,700 --> 02:28:00,580
Alright.

2368
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:02,920
There is none.

2369
02:28:05,320 --> 02:28:06,100
Not you.

2370
02:28:06,340 --> 02:28:06,600
You.

2371
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:07,840
Here we go.

2372
02:28:09,500 --> 02:28:12,300
Just gonna throw it right down there.

2373
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,090
The bait ration.

2374
02:28:22,950 --> 02:28:23,930
I don't need it.

2375
02:28:24,330 --> 02:28:25,390
I have too many rations.

2376
02:28:38,370 --> 02:28:39,050
Otacon.

2377
02:28:47,430 --> 02:28:51,090
Do you see that laser beam?

2378
02:28:53,710 --> 02:28:55,030
Do you see that...

2379
02:29:00,610 --> 02:29:01,490
Oh, shit.

2380
02:29:02,650 --> 02:29:12,030
Oh, for god's sake.

2381
02:29:22,210 --> 02:29:23,540
Well, I had to activate that anyway.

2382
02:29:28,870 --> 02:29:29,950
I'm trying to remember.

2383
02:29:30,470 --> 02:29:33,390
I think I will probably be using all my trap grenades here.

2384
02:29:35,390 --> 02:29:36,550
I think...

2385
02:29:36,550 --> 02:29:38,730
I think I'll be using all of them.

2386
02:29:45,090 --> 02:29:46,210
Northwest corner.

2387
02:29:49,550 --> 02:29:51,170
Do you need any for Act 5?

2388
02:29:51,890 --> 02:29:54,970
I don't think so.

2389
02:30:00,450 --> 02:30:01,350
No, I don't think so.

2390
02:30:07,160 --> 02:30:08,380
God, this scared me.

2391
02:30:09,080 --> 02:30:09,600
Loud.

2392
02:30:14,050 --> 02:30:14,610
Run!

2393
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:32,240
We fought.

2394
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:34,740
Yippee!

2395
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:51,800
Fellas.

2396
02:30:52,120 --> 02:30:53,520
Let's give her the 10 gift then.

2397
02:31:01,860 --> 02:31:04,140
You killed my benefactor.

2398
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:06,740
And sent my brother home a cripple.

2399
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,900
I vowed revenge.

2400
02:31:10,240 --> 02:31:11,940
But I can't go yet.

2401
02:31:12,580 --> 02:31:14,140
I still have a job to do.

2402
02:31:15,160 --> 02:31:16,580
British accent, don't go.

2403
02:31:18,100 --> 02:31:21,540
They use the twin snakes lines for this, don't they?

2404
02:31:24,360 --> 02:31:26,400
Oh, shit.

2405
02:31:27,800 --> 02:31:29,160
I forgot about this guy.

2406
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:37,360
Actually, can I...

2407
02:31:48,570 --> 02:31:50,110
Oh, you guys can't see it.

2408
02:31:50,170 --> 02:31:50,710
Look at this.

2409
02:31:52,510 --> 02:31:54,450
See that tiny little dot?

2410
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:58,390
You're kind of blocking it too on the... You can see it under the chat.

2411
02:31:58,870 --> 02:32:00,390
But that tiny little dot...

2412
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:09,580
This room is also kind of painful.

2413
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:13,800
I know there's

2414
02:32:21,790 --> 02:32:23,310
a guy down there, I'm pretty sure.

2415
02:32:29,550 --> 02:32:30,790
I don't need you.

2416
02:32:31,790 --> 02:32:33,270
But I'm crawling through.

2417
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:38,090
Stop scanning!

2418
02:32:41,870 --> 02:32:43,090
Stop scanning!

2419
02:32:47,770 --> 02:32:48,950
Just in case.

2420
02:32:59,110 --> 02:33:00,830
Oh wait, maybe he's further.

2421
02:33:06,690 --> 02:33:07,730
I think I should chaff.

2422
02:33:08,470 --> 02:33:10,510
I think I should chaff in here, maybe.

2423
02:33:13,230 --> 02:33:14,710
The cows are here.

2424
02:33:15,870 --> 02:33:17,930
I only have one left.

2425
02:33:18,990 --> 02:33:20,570
How do I only have one?

2426
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:22,750
Oh yeah, because I used the second.

2427
02:33:25,010 --> 02:33:29,230
But I think actually this might be the last part that I needed.

2428
02:33:34,380 --> 02:33:35,980
Save your chaffs!

2429
02:33:36,760 --> 02:33:38,800
This area is so scary though.

2430
02:33:39,700 --> 02:33:40,800
Does Drebin sell?

2431
02:33:40,900 --> 02:33:42,120
No, he does not.

2432
02:33:43,480 --> 02:33:44,420
Are you kidding me?

2433
02:33:44,480 --> 02:33:45,720
This area is terrifying.

2434
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:48,300
And there's cow.

2435
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:02,410
Look at them!

2436
02:34:10,320 --> 02:34:12,320
Yeah, I really don't need it for the next act.

2437
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:13,900
Like I could use it, but...

2438
02:34:14,540 --> 02:34:17,720
I feel like with the dwarf geckos in this act, it's way worse.

2439
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:20,540
I think I'm just going to use it.

2440
02:34:21,220 --> 02:34:24,640
Sorry everybody who said don't use it, but I'm going to use it.

2441
02:34:25,180 --> 02:34:26,440
I feel better using it.

2442
02:34:34,790 --> 02:34:36,350
Wait, oh shit, how do I get over there?

2443
02:34:36,690 --> 02:34:38,210
Oh shit, how do I get over there?

2444
02:35:21,150 --> 02:35:22,610
Maybe I wasted it!

2445
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:40,500
Guess we're killing everything again.

2446
02:35:43,020 --> 02:35:43,660
Yep.

2447
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:46,520
It's unarmed, we're fine.

2448
02:35:46,740 --> 02:35:47,160
Probably.

2449
02:35:55,250 --> 02:35:56,130
It's unarmed!

2450
02:35:56,390 --> 02:35:57,270
It's fine!

2451
02:35:57,610 --> 02:35:58,270
It's unarmed!

2452
02:36:06,070 --> 02:36:06,690
We made it!

2453
02:36:10,830 --> 02:36:11,890
We made it!

2454
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:16,850
No witnesses!

2455
02:36:17,650 --> 02:36:18,250
We made it!

2456
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,920
Oh there's a spooky one here.

2457
02:36:23,820 --> 02:36:25,000
Hold on, I'll show you.

2458
02:36:26,880 --> 02:36:28,340
Oh, camera.

2459
02:36:32,550 --> 02:36:33,570
Right here.

2460
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:34,270
Ready?

2461
02:36:34,570 --> 02:36:34,730
Ready?

2462
02:36:34,890 --> 02:36:35,050
Ready?

2463
02:36:39,530 --> 02:36:40,610
Spooky lady.

2464
02:36:53,570 --> 02:36:55,250
Woman jumpscare.

2465
02:37:09,390 --> 02:37:10,370
Oh my god.

2466
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:13,010
I got baited.

2467
02:37:14,310 --> 02:37:15,950
I got absolutely baited.

2468
02:37:22,030 --> 02:37:24,850
Do they stop falling or...

2469
02:37:25,550 --> 02:37:26,710
How do they even see me?

2470
02:37:28,710 --> 02:37:31,170
Guys, I don't think they're stopping.

2471
02:37:49,560 --> 02:37:51,020
I can smell you.

2472
02:37:52,640 --> 02:37:54,460
Oh my gosh, I can't even get through!

2473
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,140
Let me through!

2474
02:37:57,720 --> 02:37:59,140
Guys, this might be kinda tricky.

2475
02:38:00,020 --> 02:38:03,300
Oh my god!

2476
02:38:03,600 --> 02:38:03,940
Snake!

2477
02:38:04,080 --> 02:38:05,620
Worst place to...

2478
02:38:06,140 --> 02:38:06,620
Oh my god.

2479
02:38:07,140 --> 02:38:07,680
Just run.

2480
02:38:16,520 --> 02:38:18,740
We could farm for DP there.

2481
02:38:27,060 --> 02:38:28,720
What if we did just a little bit of that?

2482
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:31,800
You look so good with the dark outfit.

2483
02:38:31,900 --> 02:38:33,140
Thanks AndreyGhost!

2484
02:38:33,720 --> 02:38:35,220
Glad you like it.

2485
02:38:39,430 --> 02:38:40,170
Auto-Aim?

2486
02:39:18,830 --> 02:39:20,470
Did I kill all of them?

2487
02:39:20,870 --> 02:39:21,390
Did

2488
02:39:25,630 --> 02:39:27,810
I kill them all?

2489
02:39:29,290 --> 02:39:30,470
Can I get the bird?

2490
02:39:32,410 --> 02:39:32,610
Bird.

2491
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:36,910
Such a good weapon.

2492
02:39:38,190 --> 02:39:39,810
This is so awesome.

2493
02:39:41,350 --> 02:39:43,330
Oh shit, I just realized our health though.

2494
02:39:43,850 --> 02:39:44,550
Snake, you okay?

2495
02:39:44,710 --> 02:39:44,970
Are you stressed?

2496
02:39:45,930 --> 02:39:46,790
We're okay.

2497
02:39:47,210 --> 02:39:47,850
We're okay.

2498
02:39:50,030 --> 02:39:51,030
We're okay.

2499
02:39:51,310 --> 02:39:52,190
Let's have some noodles.

2500
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:54,510
Oh wait, we need the nanya.

2501
02:40:05,610 --> 02:40:06,490
You know what that looks like?

2502
02:40:06,550 --> 02:40:10,210
That looks like the little area you run through in MGS3.

2503
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:12,370
The underground area.

2504
02:40:12,670 --> 02:40:13,670
Is there anything over here anyway?

2505
02:40:15,330 --> 02:40:15,770
Nope.

2506
02:40:16,790 --> 02:40:17,130
Nope.

2507
02:40:21,490 --> 02:40:22,870
Oh, I almost missed this one.

2508
02:40:35,610 --> 02:40:37,810
Such thing as boundless slaughter.

2509
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:40,770
There is always an end to it.

2510
02:40:41,310 --> 02:40:42,730
But you are different.

2511
02:40:44,490 --> 02:40:47,930
The path you walk on has no end.

2512
02:40:49,130 --> 02:40:51,430
The killing will never end.

2513
02:40:52,150 --> 02:40:54,850
It's a future without hope.

2514
02:40:56,470 --> 02:40:57,870
Hear me, Snake!

2515
02:40:59,650 --> 02:41:02,830
My spirit will be watching you.

2516
02:41:11,010 --> 02:41:12,970
I'm healing a little bit too.

2517
02:41:14,090 --> 02:41:15,390
We got our nanya.

2518
02:41:15,650 --> 02:41:17,090
We got our health.

2519
02:41:18,010 --> 02:41:19,590
We're doing so good.

2520
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:20,590
Good job guys.

2521
02:41:29,320 --> 02:41:30,900
Now for the next fight.

2522
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:33,560
Should I be lethal?

2523
02:41:35,360 --> 02:41:38,260
I really wanna use lethal.

2524
02:41:40,340 --> 02:41:42,040
I'm looking forward to using lethal.

2525
02:41:42,580 --> 02:41:43,860
I'm gonna use lethal.

2526
02:41:45,840 --> 02:41:46,360
Railgun?

2527
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:46,900
No.

2528
02:41:48,200 --> 02:41:50,140
I think it will be way too slow.

2529
02:41:54,380 --> 02:41:55,420
The lift.

2530
02:42:05,080 --> 02:42:06,320
It's so cool.

2531
02:42:10,720 --> 02:42:12,340
Little bit of lethal as a treat.

2532
02:42:14,320 --> 02:42:15,660
I gotta potty.

2533
02:42:15,780 --> 02:42:17,420
Gotta go use little ghost's room.

2534
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,700
Oh boy.

2535
02:42:23,280 --> 02:42:26,700
Especially cause I gotta be in tip-top shape for...

2536
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:29,320
For freaking out.

2537
02:42:29,660 --> 02:42:30,460
Oh, the Mark III!

2538
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:31,720
Hello.

2539
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:40,140
Zoom in.

2540
02:42:46,660 --> 02:42:47,340
Zoom.

2541
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:55,430
Send her up.

2542
02:43:07,530 --> 02:43:09,350
Rex once stood here.

2543
02:43:14,630 --> 02:43:17,930
Remember back in the day, every easter egg, game facts...

2544
02:43:17,930 --> 02:43:19,230
Like...

2545
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:24,830
They claim that Darth Vader's helmet is in the cutscene hidden in the rubble.

2546
02:43:26,430 --> 02:43:29,190
I'm 99% sure that's not true.

2547
02:43:31,190 --> 02:43:33,330
Why did they claim this?

2548
02:43:34,910 --> 02:43:36,330
That's so funny.

2549
02:43:38,030 --> 02:43:40,710
I miss those old game facts hoaxes.

2550
02:43:41,050 --> 02:43:43,290
You don't get those much anymore, huh?

2551
02:43:43,730 --> 02:43:47,410
It's such like a product of it's time.

2552
02:43:48,990 --> 02:43:49,670
Oh boy!

2553
02:43:51,570 --> 02:43:52,670
No, bye!

2554
02:43:54,970 --> 02:43:55,570
Rex.

2555
02:43:55,830 --> 02:43:57,230
Oh, Snake's face.

2556
02:43:57,670 --> 02:44:00,330
It's like...

2557
02:44:02,890 --> 02:44:05,990
There's some more spirit photography we can even get in this room.

2558
02:44:07,310 --> 02:44:07,710
Uh-oh.

2559
02:44:08,630 --> 02:44:09,870
He looks so sad.

2560
02:44:09,990 --> 02:44:10,530
He's like...

2561
02:44:14,130 --> 02:44:15,330
The railgun!

2562
02:44:28,670 --> 02:44:29,370
This...

2563
02:44:29,370 --> 02:44:30,870
I can't.

2564
02:44:30,870 --> 02:44:32,210
I can't watch this.

2565
02:44:32,570 --> 02:44:33,990
This display.

2566
02:44:34,250 --> 02:44:35,450
This disgusting display!

2567
02:44:46,030 --> 02:44:47,610
She's tickling his tit!

2568
02:44:48,430 --> 02:44:50,090
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2569
02:44:51,890 --> 02:44:53,170
She's so...

2570
02:44:53,170 --> 02:44:56,090
Oh my god, the little snow on his mustache.

2571
02:44:59,330 --> 02:44:59,810
Why?

2572
02:44:59,810 --> 02:45:00,730
I don't understand.

2573
02:45:01,250 --> 02:45:05,170
She didn't act this way the entire game until now and she's just like...

2574
02:45:24,610 --> 02:45:25,410
Oh, shoot.

2575
02:45:27,310 --> 02:45:28,130
Hold on, men.

2576
02:45:28,610 --> 02:45:32,390
I really gotta go to the little ghost's room, you guys.

2577
02:45:32,450 --> 02:45:33,010
I'm so sorry.

2578
02:45:34,930 --> 02:45:36,590
I'm sorry I had too much tea.

2579
02:45:37,710 --> 02:45:39,330
And I'm gonna grab some more tea, too.

2580
02:45:39,910 --> 02:45:40,530
Well, I'm out.

2581
02:45:41,830 --> 02:45:43,210
Little break, little break.

2582
02:45:43,910 --> 02:45:44,970
It's been over two hours.

2583
02:45:45,170 --> 02:45:47,290
We get a little intermission.

2584
02:45:49,630 --> 02:45:50,430
Intermission, intermission.

2585
02:45:50,430 --> 02:45:52,470
Break before the big fight.

2586
02:45:52,750 --> 02:45:55,050
And even after this fight, there's more.

2587
02:45:55,450 --> 02:45:56,970
So, here, I'll even let you guys see.

2588
02:45:58,110 --> 02:45:58,630
There you go.

2589
02:46:00,490 --> 02:46:02,830
You guys can look while I...

2590
02:46:03,570 --> 02:46:05,830
While I astral project.

2591
02:46:06,410 --> 02:46:07,510
Okay, BRB.

2592
02:46:07,790 --> 02:46:08,170
Oh, wait.

2593
02:46:08,430 --> 02:46:08,790
Hold on.

2594
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,750
Let me also write...

2595
02:46:12,070 --> 02:46:13,050
I forgot.

2596
02:46:14,490 --> 02:46:17,030
I forgot that I never changed it.

2597
02:46:22,830 --> 02:46:23,270
No.

2598
02:46:25,150 --> 02:46:25,590
God.

2599
02:46:25,950 --> 02:46:27,170
There we go.

2600
02:46:30,410 --> 02:46:32,990
Alright, alright, alright.

2601
02:46:37,130 --> 02:46:40,430
Okay, I might be a few minutes because I'm gonna make my tea and...

2602
02:46:41,390 --> 02:46:42,790
go to the little ghost's room.

2603
02:46:42,870 --> 02:46:44,210
So, maybe like a minute or so.

2604
02:46:44,490 --> 02:46:44,950
Two minutes.

2605
02:46:45,150 --> 02:46:45,750
Two minutes max.

2606
02:46:46,130 --> 02:46:47,070
Okay, BRB.

2607
02:49:44,920 --> 02:49:46,120
Okay, okay.

2608
02:49:47,420 --> 02:49:49,460
Are you guys ready to fight a ramp?

2609
02:49:53,980 --> 02:49:55,100
Why is she blue?

2610
02:49:55,380 --> 02:49:56,500
I like it.

2611
02:49:57,660 --> 02:49:59,160
It looks good, right?

2612
02:50:00,260 --> 02:50:00,900
Are we complaining?

2613
02:50:01,520 --> 02:50:02,220
Are we complaining?

2614
02:50:05,380 --> 02:50:08,240
Are you ready to fight a ramp?

2615
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:19,000
Wow, I just noticed the map.

2616
02:50:19,180 --> 02:50:20,160
Oh my gosh, look.

2617
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:21,640
Wait, once the donut goes away...

2618
02:50:21,640 --> 02:50:24,840
You can see a little... Like you can see the outline of Rex.

2619
02:50:29,020 --> 02:50:29,460
Okay.

2620
02:50:31,680 --> 02:50:32,360
Where are you?

2621
02:50:37,080 --> 02:50:37,960
Where is he?

2622
02:50:38,380 --> 02:50:39,140
Oh my god.

2623
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:42,400
Don't sound like that, please.

2624
02:50:44,160 --> 02:50:44,900
Oh my god.

2625
02:50:48,560 --> 02:50:49,540
Ouch, ouch.

2626
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:50,120
Oh my god.

2627
02:50:50,640 --> 02:50:52,200
This guy sucks so much.

2628
02:50:55,540 --> 02:50:56,640
Oh, it does nothing.

2629
02:50:57,560 --> 02:50:58,200
Okay, hold on.

2630
02:51:02,600 --> 02:51:03,080
Ouch.

2631
02:51:08,720 --> 02:51:10,380
Oh my god, it does no damage.

2632
02:51:11,260 --> 02:51:12,440
He sucks so much.

2633
02:51:18,010 --> 02:51:18,850
Okay, okay.

2634
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:31,900
I tried to roll.

2635
02:51:32,300 --> 02:51:33,040
I tried to roll.

2636
02:51:38,380 --> 02:51:38,920
Yeah,

2637
02:51:42,940 --> 02:51:44,380
let's use a different gun.

2638
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:45,900
Disappointing.

2639
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,700
Wait, I can just unload on him.

2640
02:51:47,980 --> 02:51:48,320
Duh.

2641
02:51:50,160 --> 02:51:52,160
I can just unload on him.

2642
02:51:52,900 --> 02:51:53,820
Wait, hold on.

2643
02:51:53,900 --> 02:51:54,540
Hold on, mister.

2644
02:52:00,080 --> 02:52:01,900
I hate auto-aim so much.

2645
02:52:14,090 --> 02:52:15,710
Nevermind, auto-aim is great.

2646
02:52:24,570 --> 02:52:28,550
Sir, you are kinda currently not winning the...

2647
02:52:28,550 --> 02:52:29,130
Bye!

2648
02:52:37,270 --> 02:52:38,070
Ouch.

2649
02:52:38,930 --> 02:52:40,490
I don't care.

2650
02:52:41,530 --> 02:52:43,710
I don't care if I'm unloading all on you.

2651
02:52:46,770 --> 02:52:48,650
Is this the Patriot?

2652
02:52:48,750 --> 02:52:49,230
Absolutely.

2653
02:52:49,230 --> 02:52:49,430
Absolutely.

2654
02:52:52,530 --> 02:52:53,270
He's done!

2655
02:52:53,650 --> 02:52:55,070
Oh my god, I might be done.

2656
02:52:57,270 --> 02:53:00,850
No, it's not my best, but it's getting the job done.

2657
02:53:00,990 --> 02:53:01,470
That's for sure.

2658
02:53:02,710 --> 02:53:04,550
Where is your motivation?

2659
02:53:14,520 --> 02:53:15,400
Oh shoot.

2660
02:53:15,960 --> 02:53:16,960
Wait, uhm...

2661
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:19,940
Do I have it in my items?

2662
02:53:19,940 --> 02:53:20,000
Items?

2663
02:53:22,820 --> 02:53:25,020
Shoot, let's get rid of the nanya.

2664
02:53:32,960 --> 02:53:34,020
Oh shoot.

2665
02:53:36,700 --> 02:53:37,980
Oh shoot.

2666
02:53:41,960 --> 02:53:44,020
Where is the yellow dead cell?

2667
02:53:44,380 --> 02:53:44,820
Right?

2668
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,360
Actually, we have that.

2669
02:54:21,530 --> 02:54:22,410
Oh shoot.

2670
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:26,390
I was too good at the game.

2671
02:54:27,630 --> 02:54:28,910
Wait, come here.

2672
02:54:29,370 --> 02:54:29,970
Come here.

2673
02:54:47,350 --> 02:54:50,510
Man, I wish I could use my Patriot.

2674
02:54:50,670 --> 02:54:52,230
It's no use.

2675
02:54:52,790 --> 02:54:54,690
It's no use.

2676
02:55:02,390 --> 02:55:04,530
Do I have to do it non-lethally?

2677
02:55:11,020 --> 02:55:12,300
I don't?

2678
02:55:17,410 --> 02:55:19,250
Ok, let's do it again.

2679
02:55:23,900 --> 02:55:24,360
Oh shoot.

2680
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:25,460
Please, please.

2681
02:55:29,820 --> 02:55:32,360
Ok, hold on.

2682
02:55:33,100 --> 02:55:33,320
Ok.

2683
02:55:33,560 --> 02:55:34,280
Oh shoot.

2684
02:55:34,280 --> 02:55:34,420
Oh shoot.

2685
02:55:37,920 --> 02:55:39,400
Oh wait, I got it.

2686
02:55:39,500 --> 02:55:40,860
Wait, this is a CQC gun.

2687
02:55:42,980 --> 02:55:43,480
Grab him!

2688
02:55:43,820 --> 02:55:44,220
Grab him!

2689
02:55:44,780 --> 02:55:45,160
Oh shoot.

2690
02:55:45,460 --> 02:55:46,460
I need to crash him.

2691
02:55:46,540 --> 02:55:47,040
Sorry guys.

2692
02:56:12,610 --> 02:56:13,450
What's the button?

2693
02:56:14,130 --> 02:56:14,870
Oh my god.

2694
02:56:15,630 --> 02:56:16,410
What is it again?

2695
02:56:19,470 --> 02:56:20,250
Oh shoot.

2696
02:56:20,710 --> 02:56:21,310
No, no, no.

2697
02:56:24,190 --> 02:56:25,730
I just punched him.

2698
02:56:28,770 --> 02:56:29,570
I can.

2699
02:56:30,370 --> 02:56:31,210
Oh triangle.

2700
02:56:35,950 --> 02:56:37,230
Come here, man.

2701
02:56:39,390 --> 02:56:41,810
Guys, I think maybe I don't know how to play the game.

2702
02:56:44,110 --> 02:56:44,990
Oh my god.

2703
02:56:45,730 --> 02:56:49,670
God, this son of a bitch.

2704
02:56:51,030 --> 02:56:52,310
I'm so bad at the game.

2705
02:56:52,850 --> 02:56:53,170
Come here.

2706
02:56:53,790 --> 02:56:54,270
What?

2707
02:56:54,850 --> 02:56:55,090
What?

2708
02:56:57,850 --> 02:56:59,870
No, it says it's a CQC gun.

2709
02:57:00,750 --> 02:57:01,890
So I should be able to.

2710
02:57:02,370 --> 02:57:04,010
I'll try it with the operator though.

2711
02:57:04,830 --> 02:57:05,350
Where did he go?

2712
02:57:13,670 --> 02:57:15,330
Guys, triangle is not doing anything.

2713
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:23,520
Guys, it's not doing anything.

2714
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:26,980
Oh shit.

2715
02:57:27,400 --> 02:57:28,060
Oh my god.

2716
02:57:28,180 --> 02:57:29,120
I'm dying now.

2717
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:31,920
Maybe I should just restart so I don't waste all my...

2718
02:57:35,040 --> 02:57:35,920
Where are you?

2719
02:57:38,960 --> 02:57:39,360
Grab.

2720
02:57:39,580 --> 02:57:41,340
Wait, no, I was asking...

2721
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:45,300
Guys, I was asking how to grab, not how to do the triangle.

2722
02:57:45,700 --> 02:57:47,560
It prompts you to triangle.

2723
02:57:48,540 --> 02:57:51,360
No, I thought you meant triangle to grab.

2724
02:57:52,380 --> 02:57:54,020
This health is still too high?

2725
02:57:54,180 --> 02:57:54,480
Seriously?

2726
02:57:55,660 --> 02:57:56,640
Oh, there it is.

2727
02:57:57,440 --> 02:57:58,540
That's so unlucky.

2728
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:06,120
Hold on, I'm just gonna restart.

2729
02:58:08,960 --> 02:58:09,880
Just kill me.

2730
02:58:10,020 --> 02:58:10,680
Just kill me.

2731
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:13,360
I don't want to waste all my...

2732
02:58:13,960 --> 02:58:14,840
Just kill me.

2733
02:58:14,960 --> 02:58:16,760
I don't want to waste all my rations.

2734
02:58:23,410 --> 02:58:24,970
Tactical retreat everybody.

2735
02:58:25,150 --> 02:58:26,210
It's a tactical retreat.

2736
02:58:28,750 --> 02:58:30,230
Well, I have my tea.

2737
02:58:34,290 --> 02:58:35,910
Oh, I love this one though.

2738
02:58:38,090 --> 02:58:40,690
It's so messed...

2739
02:58:48,230 --> 02:58:48,910
Beautiful!

2740
02:58:49,250 --> 02:58:49,710
Beautiful!

2741
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:52,630
What a way to go.

2742
02:58:52,890 --> 02:58:53,730
Again, again!

2743
02:58:56,650 --> 02:58:58,770
Wow, that was so good.

2744
02:59:01,030 --> 02:59:03,750
See, now we have all our rations.

2745
02:59:04,550 --> 02:59:08,190
We can switch to the patriot and we'll be so good.

2746
02:59:08,270 --> 02:59:11,410
Oh, I already have it equipped because I...

2747
02:59:11,410 --> 02:59:12,270
I know.

2748
02:59:12,690 --> 02:59:15,070
And I have... Oh, you gotta switch out the Nenya.

2749
02:59:18,410 --> 02:59:19,590
Oh, Nenya.

2750
02:59:19,830 --> 02:59:23,270
Oh my god, I've been calling it Nenya this entire time.

2751
02:59:24,890 --> 02:59:26,670
Where did I get Nenya from?

2752
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:28,610
Why didn't you guys correct me?

2753
02:59:32,990 --> 02:59:34,030
Where is he?

2754
02:59:39,610 --> 02:59:40,790
Oh, where is he?

2755
02:59:46,220 --> 02:59:48,360
This is the easiest way to do it.

2756
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:03,800
OK, we need you to not die up there though.

2757
03:00:11,340 --> 03:00:12,220
Come on!

2758
03:00:13,480 --> 03:00:14,060
Oh, grab him!

2759
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:14,560
Grab him!

2760
03:00:15,040 --> 03:00:15,520
Grab him!

2761
03:00:19,590 --> 03:00:20,030
OK,

2762
03:00:25,720 --> 03:00:27,320
let me try switching to the operator.

2763
03:00:30,280 --> 03:00:31,400
Come here!

2764
03:00:34,240 --> 03:00:34,940
Grab him!

2765
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:35,620
Grab him!

2766
03:00:36,900 --> 03:00:38,220
There we go!

2767
03:00:38,880 --> 03:00:40,300
And... Injecto!

2768
03:00:44,600 --> 03:00:47,780
I thought that because it said CQC for the patriot it would work.

2769
03:00:47,780 --> 03:00:48,000
There.

2770
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,060
Now you're a mere mortal, like the rest of us.

2771
03:00:53,420 --> 03:00:59,220
But can you kill this mere mortal?

2772
03:01:02,120 --> 03:01:04,320
I thought it because it said CQC.

2773
03:01:05,160 --> 03:01:06,040
That's so misleading.

2774
03:01:11,110 --> 03:01:12,330
Oh my goodness.

2775
03:01:13,930 --> 03:01:14,670
Uh-oh.

2776
03:01:14,890 --> 03:01:15,430
What does that mean?

2777
03:01:17,870 --> 03:01:20,030
Why do they sound like...

2778
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:26,510
Slice and dice!

2779
03:01:28,010 --> 03:01:30,390
I like how they sound like cicadas.

2780
03:01:34,390 --> 03:01:35,150
Wow!

2781
03:01:35,570 --> 03:01:37,430
Who could be our mysterious savior?

2782
03:01:45,390 --> 03:01:46,870
That's not the line.

2783
03:01:47,770 --> 03:01:49,030
You ready for this?

2784
03:01:50,190 --> 03:01:52,390
Sunny gave me the go-ahead.

2785
03:02:07,760 --> 03:02:10,660
After seeing this game, Revengeance is like the perfect...

2786
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:12,880
perfect sequel for Raiden.

2787
03:02:13,860 --> 03:02:14,880
In terms of gameplay.

2788
03:02:15,800 --> 03:02:16,180
You know?

2789
03:02:16,960 --> 03:02:18,640
Sunny is a good girl.

2790
03:02:18,760 --> 03:02:20,080
How about it, undying man?

2791
03:02:20,640 --> 03:02:22,000
Care to die too?

2792
03:02:23,020 --> 03:02:26,900
Sorry, but I can't die just yet.

2793
03:02:28,840 --> 03:02:30,080
He's so cool.

2794
03:02:31,120 --> 03:02:31,720
Wow.

2795
03:02:32,080 --> 03:02:32,720
Oh my gosh.

2796
03:02:32,920 --> 03:02:34,280
Blunt Cut Queen.

2797
03:02:42,260 --> 03:02:44,260
Okay, I have a good gun for that now.

2798
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:50,550
I got you.

2799
03:02:50,970 --> 03:02:52,230
Oh, I mean...

2800
03:02:57,900 --> 03:02:59,280
That works too?

2801
03:03:02,860 --> 03:03:04,160
Get him in there.

2802
03:03:04,900 --> 03:03:07,120
Oh no, I just realized.

2803
03:03:09,740 --> 03:03:12,220
I forgot to get...

2804
03:03:12,220 --> 03:03:14,060
Can I still get the Spirit Photographer here?

2805
03:03:16,660 --> 03:03:18,140
Is it lined up after this game?

2806
03:03:18,760 --> 03:03:20,740
It's actually technically the final game.

2807
03:03:24,140 --> 03:03:24,800
No way.

2808
03:03:28,030 --> 03:03:29,450
Before Revengeance, right?

2809
03:03:34,740 --> 03:03:35,620
Sensual man.

2810
03:03:36,260 --> 03:03:37,220
He wants Raiden.

2811
03:03:38,320 --> 03:03:39,600
I mean, look at those claws.

2812
03:03:44,680 --> 03:03:45,660
All the way around.

2813
03:03:45,800 --> 03:03:46,340
Oh my god.

2814
03:03:50,760 --> 03:03:53,720
I think I'll probably save Revengeance though for after 5.

2815
03:03:54,780 --> 03:03:58,480
Even though it's not technically release order, but it's not part of the story, so...

2816
03:03:59,460 --> 03:04:01,420
Like, you know, the solid story.

2817
03:04:01,940 --> 03:04:04,080
So I think it's okay to save it.

2818
03:04:07,400 --> 03:04:09,500
You know what time you can duel out of release order?

2819
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:22,260
Oh my god.

2820
03:04:26,480 --> 03:04:27,460
Sorry, Otacon.

2821
03:04:27,720 --> 03:04:28,940
Hold on one second.

2822
03:04:33,660 --> 03:04:35,100
I think I missed it.

2823
03:04:35,160 --> 03:04:37,460
Oh, I wanted to show you guys the Spirit Photography.

2824
03:04:37,560 --> 03:04:38,420
I completely forgot.

2825
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:39,820
I got so into...

2826
03:04:40,620 --> 03:04:43,220
I got so into...

2827
03:04:44,380 --> 03:04:44,980
Vamp.

2828
03:04:46,480 --> 03:04:47,080
Shoot.

2829
03:04:51,720 --> 03:04:52,660
It's okay.

2830
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:55,280
There's one, so I'll tell you.

2831
03:04:55,460 --> 03:04:57,040
At the foot of...

2832
03:04:57,040 --> 03:05:00,660
At the foot of Rex, you can find...

2833
03:05:00,660 --> 03:05:01,520
Gray Fox.

2834
03:05:02,220 --> 03:05:06,460
And then in the mouth of Rex, you can find Liquid.

2835
03:05:07,660 --> 03:05:09,540
So that's kind of fun, I think.

2836
03:05:11,780 --> 03:05:13,860
I can't... Oh, I'm on Playboy for some reason.

2837
03:05:14,160 --> 03:05:15,640
Why did I get that?

2838
03:05:21,230 --> 03:05:21,990
Yep, you're welcome.

2839
03:05:23,470 --> 03:05:24,470
Oh my god.

2840
03:05:29,530 --> 03:05:30,330
Can I hit that?

2841
03:05:33,270 --> 03:05:33,670
No.

2842
03:05:34,150 --> 03:05:34,770
Maybe this one?

2843
03:05:38,630 --> 03:05:39,370
Maybe one more?

2844
03:05:41,270 --> 03:05:41,950
There we go.

2845
03:05:44,690 --> 03:05:45,490
Oh, that's...

2846
03:05:45,490 --> 03:05:47,030
Actually, I wonder if you can do it here.

2847
03:05:47,510 --> 03:05:47,890
Let's try.

2848
03:05:48,770 --> 03:05:49,910
Where's my camera?

2849
03:05:50,050 --> 03:05:51,910
No, camera mode not allowed.

2850
03:05:52,230 --> 03:05:52,790
Oh shoot.

2851
03:05:53,630 --> 03:05:54,510
Sorry guys.

2852
03:05:54,910 --> 03:05:56,890
Sorry I missed the...

2853
03:06:08,030 --> 03:06:10,630
Why are you not going down?

2854
03:06:10,750 --> 03:06:11,310
Oh my god.

2855
03:06:13,590 --> 03:06:14,230
Tanky.

2856
03:06:16,150 --> 03:06:17,050
Just what?

2857
03:06:18,250 --> 03:06:19,190
I'm watching.

2858
03:06:40,590 --> 03:06:41,610
Can I get him through the hole?

2859
03:06:46,350 --> 03:06:46,990
I'm not!

2860
03:06:47,770 --> 03:06:48,530
Get him in the butt!

2861
03:06:49,090 --> 03:06:49,590
Oh shoot.

2862
03:06:50,130 --> 03:06:51,130
Get him in the butt!

2863
03:06:52,330 --> 03:06:53,370
Get him in the butt!

2864
03:06:53,610 --> 03:06:54,290
Get the butt!

2865
03:07:05,630 --> 03:07:06,490
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

2866
03:07:08,130 --> 03:07:08,950
I'm out of ammo.

2867
03:07:11,490 --> 03:07:12,510
Raiden, be careful!

2868
03:07:13,090 --> 03:07:16,890
Raiden, you got... You guys are probably... I can't even look at the left side or the right side of the screen.

2869
03:07:16,890 --> 03:07:19,750
Here, I'll move you guys over so you can watch him.

2870
03:07:20,470 --> 03:07:21,510
I'll move you guys over here.

2871
03:07:22,170 --> 03:07:24,230
So you guys can see everything that's going on with Raiden.

2872
03:07:24,350 --> 03:07:24,930
Oh, and me too.

2873
03:07:28,470 --> 03:07:31,890
I'll be on this side for the...

2874
03:07:35,130 --> 03:07:36,750
Sorry for taking so long with it.

2875
03:07:37,530 --> 03:07:39,670
I don't know if you guys were asking me to do it or not.

2876
03:07:40,530 --> 03:07:41,230
It's this one, right?

2877
03:07:41,910 --> 03:07:42,790
I think so.

2878
03:07:44,290 --> 03:07:44,650
M82A2?

2879
03:07:45,130 --> 03:07:46,090
Let me double check.

2880
03:07:48,670 --> 03:07:49,110
Yes.

2881
03:07:49,330 --> 03:07:50,370
Wow, those are expensive.

2882
03:07:59,110 --> 03:08:01,090
Let's do like...

2883
03:08:01,650 --> 03:08:02,230
Ah, it's ok.

2884
03:08:03,770 --> 03:08:07,390
We've made so much... We're almost back to where we were before.

2885
03:08:08,490 --> 03:08:10,190
Left your cool war stuff right here.

2886
03:08:10,290 --> 03:08:11,110
Hot yaoi moment.

2887
03:08:13,790 --> 03:08:17,330
This part is an autoscroller, so we have time to read donations.

2888
03:08:19,750 --> 03:08:22,090
Oh shoot, I forgot to...

2889
03:08:25,730 --> 03:08:26,710
There we go.

2890
03:08:35,210 --> 03:08:36,790
What is the weak point?

2891
03:08:39,650 --> 03:08:40,610
Oh my god.

2892
03:08:43,950 --> 03:08:45,070
The ass!

2893
03:08:45,350 --> 03:08:47,050
The ass is the weak point!

2894
03:08:50,290 --> 03:08:51,130
Oh shoot.

2895
03:09:06,130 --> 03:09:07,490
Who's also attack...

2896
03:09:07,490 --> 03:09:12,190
Oh my gosh, awkward.

2897
03:09:14,130 --> 03:09:14,630
No!

2898
03:09:21,070 --> 03:09:21,890
Thank you.

2899
03:09:22,670 --> 03:09:26,130
Oh my gosh, I keep running right into these bozos though.

2900
03:09:26,610 --> 03:09:27,470
I'm so dumb.

2901
03:09:37,060 --> 03:09:37,520
Hello?

2902
03:09:37,900 --> 03:09:39,160
Oh, I'm out of bullets?

2903
03:09:39,660 --> 03:09:41,000
Wait, but I just bought bullets!

2904
03:09:42,760 --> 03:09:44,900
Guys, did I buy the wrong bullets?

2905
03:09:48,800 --> 03:09:50,300
I literally just bought...

2906
03:09:54,070 --> 03:09:55,410
Did I buy the wrong bullets?

2907
03:10:04,370 --> 03:10:05,910
I used that many already?

2908
03:10:06,490 --> 03:10:07,470
No way!

2909
03:10:12,610 --> 03:10:13,070
Flip.

2910
03:10:13,450 --> 03:10:14,350
Should we use the railgun?

2911
03:10:14,390 --> 03:10:15,150
We can try it.

2912
03:10:15,330 --> 03:10:16,170
Let's try the railgun.

2913
03:10:16,230 --> 03:10:17,170
Oh, I already have it equipped.

2914
03:10:18,910 --> 03:10:19,370
Railgun!

2915
03:10:19,750 --> 03:10:20,630
Oh, wrong thing.

2916
03:10:20,810 --> 03:10:21,610
Not the iPod.

2917
03:10:22,610 --> 03:10:23,570
Nope, nope, nope.

2918
03:10:24,270 --> 03:10:25,830
I still want my ration equipped.

2919
03:10:30,570 --> 03:10:31,650
Come on!

2920
03:10:33,690 --> 03:10:33,970
Shoot!

2921
03:10:35,590 --> 03:10:36,410
I can't!

2922
03:10:36,470 --> 03:10:36,890
I can't!

2923
03:10:37,150 --> 03:10:38,850
You guys, this was a terrible idea!

2924
03:10:39,110 --> 03:10:39,630
Oh fuck!

2925
03:10:40,010 --> 03:10:40,430
Oh fuck!

2926
03:11:04,480 --> 03:11:05,550
Oh my gosh.

2927
03:11:11,790 --> 03:11:13,190
At least they're on sale!

2928
03:11:16,230 --> 03:11:17,110
I'm trying!

2929
03:11:17,110 --> 03:11:17,190
I'm trying!

2930
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:41,040
I can't determine what their weak spot is.

2931
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,640
I can't determine what their weak spot is.

2932
03:11:46,100 --> 03:11:47,500
I think I'm bad at the game.

2933
03:11:50,100 --> 03:11:51,280
The head?

2934
03:11:51,920 --> 03:11:52,460
Is it?

2935
03:11:53,600 --> 03:11:54,700
Is it?

2936
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:59,480
Sure, we'll use the Patriot in the dire moment.

2937
03:11:59,960 --> 03:12:00,880
Which is this.

2938
03:12:02,120 --> 03:12:03,000
What was that?

2939
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:10,580
Oh my gosh!

2940
03:12:15,520 --> 03:12:16,120
Okay,

2941
03:12:19,520 --> 03:12:19,820
okay.

2942
03:12:20,440 --> 03:12:21,240
Oh my god!

2943
03:12:21,300 --> 03:12:22,440
I couldn't avoid that one!

2944
03:12:35,310 --> 03:12:37,250
That was one shot, baby!

2945
03:12:53,310 --> 03:12:54,430
That's right!

2946
03:12:55,170 --> 03:12:55,950
Go down!

2947
03:12:56,490 --> 03:12:56,950
Go down!

2948
03:12:57,070 --> 03:12:57,550
Down, girl!

2949
03:12:57,610 --> 03:12:57,890
Down!

2950
03:13:09,590 --> 03:13:12,930
I need to run in here when they start...

2951
03:13:14,310 --> 03:13:15,810
coming after me.

2952
03:13:16,150 --> 03:13:16,610
Anymore?

2953
03:13:18,010 --> 03:13:19,050
Rion, are you okay up there?

2954
03:13:20,130 --> 03:13:21,190
Rion, are you good?

2955
03:13:25,130 --> 03:13:26,630
I think we're clean!

2956
03:13:27,070 --> 03:13:27,710
Alright!

2957
03:13:32,810 --> 03:13:33,430
Oh shoot!

2958
03:13:33,890 --> 03:13:34,950
We're not clean.

2959
03:13:40,190 --> 03:13:41,190
Where is he?

2960
03:13:41,530 --> 03:13:42,010
Oh my gosh.

2961
03:13:43,070 --> 03:13:43,710
Ouch!

2962
03:13:43,990 --> 03:13:44,330
Ouch!

2963
03:13:56,430 --> 03:13:57,330
Oh my god.

2964
03:13:57,490 --> 03:13:58,190
I didn't mean to...

2965
03:14:04,250 --> 03:14:05,110
Thank you.

2966
03:14:05,670 --> 03:14:06,870
I think I'm dying a little.

2967
03:14:07,230 --> 03:14:08,410
Those my body parts?

2968
03:14:09,130 --> 03:14:11,030
Oh my god.

2969
03:14:11,210 --> 03:14:12,070
Stop stretching!

2970
03:14:15,240 --> 03:14:16,460
Woo!

2971
03:14:17,520 --> 03:14:19,140
Stop shooting me!

2972
03:14:24,070 --> 03:14:25,930
There's more over there.

2973
03:14:25,990 --> 03:14:26,550
Oh my god.

2974
03:14:28,920 --> 03:14:30,830
You son of a gun.

2975
03:14:44,070 --> 03:14:44,680
Thank

2976
03:14:49,120 --> 03:14:50,340
you.

2977
03:14:53,360 --> 03:14:54,580
Where?

2978
03:14:56,280 --> 03:14:57,440
Oh my god.

2979
03:15:01,100 --> 03:15:01,500
Okay.

2980
03:15:01,940 --> 03:15:02,300
Okay.

2981
03:15:03,160 --> 03:15:03,560
Okay.

2982
03:15:03,720 --> 03:15:03,840
Okay.

2983
03:15:04,400 --> 03:15:04,800
Okay.

2984
03:15:06,120 --> 03:15:07,120
Where are they?

2985
03:15:07,500 --> 03:15:08,180
I see them.

2986
03:15:10,580 --> 03:15:12,280
Have you guys seen that cow?

2987
03:15:12,440 --> 03:15:13,240
I think it's a cow.

2988
03:15:13,820 --> 03:15:15,900
He goes...

2989
03:15:18,220 --> 03:15:18,620
No!

2990
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:19,960
I won't let you.

2991
03:15:22,600 --> 03:15:23,180
Oh my god.

2992
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:23,780
I'm out of bullets.

2993
03:15:25,140 --> 03:15:25,420
Shit.

2994
03:15:25,620 --> 03:15:25,620
Shit.

2995
03:15:25,780 --> 03:15:25,900
Shit.

2996
03:15:25,900 --> 03:15:26,040
Okay.

2997
03:15:26,220 --> 03:15:26,780
Time to buy more.

2998
03:15:27,780 --> 03:15:28,740
Time to buy more.

2999
03:15:34,210 --> 03:15:36,390
They are like, you found your moon.

3000
03:15:36,590 --> 03:15:37,230
He goes...

3001
03:15:43,570 --> 03:15:44,810
I'm trying!

3002
03:16:04,560 --> 03:16:05,380
No!

3003
03:16:10,160 --> 03:16:11,260
One shot.

3004
03:16:16,580 --> 03:16:17,180
What?

3005
03:16:17,180 --> 03:16:18,020
Raiden, are you okay?

3006
03:16:26,220 --> 03:16:27,800
Kill him already, please.

3007
03:16:30,100 --> 03:16:31,040
Thank you.

3008
03:16:31,420 --> 03:16:31,740
Wow.

3009
03:16:31,900 --> 03:16:33,300
Ask and you shall receive.

3010
03:16:33,580 --> 03:16:34,840
Look at his little smile.

3011
03:16:48,150 --> 03:16:50,650
What a beautiful thing to see this.

3012
03:16:51,810 --> 03:16:52,610
This guy.

3013
03:16:52,910 --> 03:16:53,310
Die!

3014
03:16:54,150 --> 03:16:55,770
Oh my gosh.

3015
03:16:55,830 --> 03:16:56,750
Thank you for the raid.

3016
03:16:56,970 --> 03:16:58,410
I hope you had fun with Doom.

3017
03:16:59,670 --> 03:17:01,350
Sorry if you guys are coming in here.

3018
03:17:01,490 --> 03:17:02,710
This is a lot of spoilers.

3019
03:17:04,150 --> 03:17:05,390
It's okay if you leave.

3020
03:17:06,330 --> 03:17:09,790
If you plan on playing Metal Gear, don't watch!

3021
03:17:12,770 --> 03:17:15,470
If you plan on playing Metal Gear, don't watch!

3022
03:17:18,330 --> 03:17:19,850
Thank you for the gifted, you guys.

3023
03:17:19,930 --> 03:17:20,870
Thank you, Spank.

3024
03:17:20,970 --> 03:17:21,590
Thank you, Robin.

3025
03:17:22,290 --> 03:17:23,290
Thank you, Zipley.

3026
03:17:24,630 --> 03:17:25,790
Okay, welcome to Mambushu.

3027
03:17:25,970 --> 03:17:33,470
This is like huge, huge spoilers, you guys.

3028
03:17:33,470 --> 03:17:35,090
Close your eyes.

3029
03:17:35,450 --> 03:17:36,150
Go away.

3030
03:17:37,170 --> 03:17:38,090
I mean, hi, KFB.

3031
03:17:38,350 --> 03:17:38,590
Thanks.

3032
03:17:39,530 --> 03:17:40,630
Thanks, Chara, for the raid.

3033
03:17:43,810 --> 03:17:45,610
Superliminal things are the thing of the day.

3034
03:17:49,830 --> 03:17:50,290
Oh,

3035
03:17:54,990 --> 03:17:58,010
Raiden got a little bit of his... on your face.

3036
03:18:01,090 --> 03:18:02,490
Why?

3037
03:18:03,870 --> 03:18:04,470
Why?

3038
03:18:22,030 --> 03:18:31,270
I don't want your crocodile tears.

3039
03:18:34,130 --> 03:18:40,470
I love, like, a little bit of the opening, like, the title screen music of MGS1.

3040
03:18:43,650 --> 03:18:44,930
She was going to.

3041
03:18:45,590 --> 03:18:47,190
Until he told her that.

3042
03:18:47,870 --> 03:18:49,350
She even has it out and everything.

3043
03:18:49,350 --> 03:18:49,830
I'm sorry.

3044
03:18:57,030 --> 03:19:03,370
I'm going to eat crackers while I watch.

3045
03:19:42,700 --> 03:19:45,480
Oh, my God.

3046
03:19:45,640 --> 03:19:48,160
That's the man that killed Otacon's sister.

3047
03:19:50,260 --> 03:19:52,640
And she still acts like that.

3048
03:20:00,200 --> 03:20:01,580
Shut up!

3049
03:20:05,200 --> 03:20:06,600
It's ended.

3050
03:20:09,200 --> 03:20:10,120
Snake.

3051
03:20:11,780 --> 03:20:13,620
Liquids down below us.

3052
03:20:14,700 --> 03:20:20,440
He's stolen the Patriot system, slipped out of their sight and taken their Ark.

3053
03:20:21,940 --> 03:20:22,860
Ark?

3054
03:20:23,580 --> 03:20:24,500
A warship.

3055
03:20:25,620 --> 03:20:31,460
Unfettered by land, law, country or network.

3056
03:20:31,460 --> 03:20:37,600
The only place where they are truly released from the shackles of the Patriots.

3057
03:20:38,460 --> 03:20:40,700
The place where they can be free.

3058
03:20:43,480 --> 03:20:44,580
Outer Haven.

3059
03:20:48,460 --> 03:20:52,020
Liquid plans to launch the nuke from that ship.

3060
03:20:58,100 --> 03:20:58,860
Snake.

3061
03:21:01,340 --> 03:21:05,780
You have been given life so that you may fulfill your purpose.

3062
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:12,560
When all of this is over, you'll have no choice but to accept death.

3063
03:21:12,880 --> 03:21:13,680
Shut up!

3064
03:21:13,780 --> 03:21:15,380
Shut up!

3065
03:21:15,760 --> 03:21:17,920
You are such a miserable human being!

3066
03:21:18,280 --> 03:21:20,200
So that we can atone for our sins.

3067
03:21:21,600 --> 03:21:24,560
Your life was created for that very purpose.

3068
03:21:24,960 --> 03:21:25,960
I hate her so much.

3069
03:21:26,020 --> 03:21:28,240
We all must atone for our sins.

3070
03:21:28,240 --> 03:21:30,520
She puts these stupid thoughts into Snake's head.

3071
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:32,800
We must not pass them on to the next generation.

3072
03:21:33,700 --> 03:21:35,840
We must not leave them for the future.

3073
03:21:36,740 --> 03:21:38,800
That is your true fate.

3074
03:21:39,640 --> 03:21:42,120
One that even you cannot defy.

3075
03:21:52,070 --> 03:21:53,390
Oh yeah!

3076
03:21:54,630 --> 03:21:55,610
Oh yeah!

3077
03:21:56,350 --> 03:21:56,610
Woo!

3078
03:21:58,350 --> 03:21:59,630
We are the same.

3079
03:21:59,630 --> 03:22:02,230
We're living corpses.

3080
03:22:03,730 --> 03:22:07,710
Our bodies kept barely alive by nanomachines.

3081
03:22:09,410 --> 03:22:10,850
I'm you.

3082
03:22:11,550 --> 03:22:12,190
Cancer.

3083
03:22:13,530 --> 03:22:14,770
Yeah, you are.

3084
03:22:18,170 --> 03:22:22,530
You are a cancer in my afterlife, Naomi Hunter.

3085
03:22:22,790 --> 03:22:23,170
Please.

3086
03:22:23,510 --> 03:22:25,070
But there's nothing more they can do.

3087
03:22:26,870 --> 03:22:28,850
With the nanomachines gone...

3088
03:22:30,410 --> 03:22:33,450
Time will unfreeze and begin to flow again.

3089
03:22:34,230 --> 03:22:35,670
What are you saying?

3090
03:22:36,190 --> 03:22:37,910
Oh my god.

3091
03:22:39,350 --> 03:22:39,870
Goodbye.

3092
03:22:42,310 --> 03:22:42,750
Hell.

3093
03:22:48,610 --> 03:22:49,130
Don't!

3094
03:22:50,410 --> 03:22:52,910
And she also, she really did not have to do this.

3095
03:22:53,990 --> 03:22:55,850
She did not have to do this.

3096
03:22:56,670 --> 03:22:58,650
And she does it in front of him!

3097
03:23:01,650 --> 03:23:03,610
So he can just watch her die!

3098
03:23:04,750 --> 03:23:06,450
You're so fucked up, Naomi Hunter.

3099
03:23:13,790 --> 03:23:16,810
Nobody ever have... Look at them, just looking down on you.

3100
03:23:16,890 --> 03:23:18,010
Nobody has sympathy for you!

3101
03:23:18,010 --> 03:23:21,890
Give the best to Sunny.

3102
03:23:23,570 --> 03:23:25,870
Naomi, don't do it.

3103
03:23:28,070 --> 03:23:29,870
She's gotta be the main character.

3104
03:23:30,030 --> 03:23:31,750
She's gotta have the most dramatics.

3105
03:23:32,090 --> 03:23:34,690
She's gotta be the one on everybody's mind.

3106
03:23:37,710 --> 03:23:39,930
It's even funnier the second time.

3107
03:23:41,090 --> 03:23:43,150
Not for Otacon though.

3108
03:23:43,750 --> 03:23:44,350
Why?

3109
03:23:50,170 --> 03:23:51,630
That's a great question, Otacon!

3110
03:23:52,070 --> 03:23:53,650
That is a really good question.

3111
03:23:53,890 --> 03:23:54,290
Why?

3112
03:23:54,950 --> 03:23:55,550
Why?

3113
03:23:55,830 --> 03:23:56,150
Why?

3114
03:23:56,510 --> 03:23:56,510
Why?

3115
03:23:56,670 --> 03:23:56,870
Why?

3116
03:24:00,490 --> 03:24:01,890
Maximum trauma achieved.

3117
03:24:02,190 --> 03:24:02,910
You'll remember me.

3118
03:24:05,570 --> 03:24:07,110
You're so messed up.

3119
03:24:07,750 --> 03:24:10,270
Please, you are so messed up, Naomi Hunter.

3120
03:24:11,190 --> 03:24:13,490
Look, and she takes the camera down with her.

3121
03:24:13,830 --> 03:24:15,710
So that he'll just watch her die.

3122
03:24:18,550 --> 03:24:18,990
We

3123
03:24:36,970 --> 03:24:38,010
gotta get out of here.

3124
03:24:44,610 --> 03:24:45,910
A little part 3.

3125
03:24:51,430 --> 03:24:51,870
Yeah,

3126
03:25:17,480 --> 03:25:17,920
you're right.

3127
03:25:18,100 --> 03:25:18,900
You're right, Gaspar.

3128
03:25:19,440 --> 03:25:20,660
Otacon, you're too good for her.

3129
03:25:21,940 --> 03:25:23,420
You're too good for her.

3130
03:25:23,500 --> 03:25:27,620
You saw, you saw the way she cradled Vamp in her arms.

3131
03:25:28,380 --> 03:25:30,180
She didn't have to do that either.

3132
03:25:34,720 --> 03:25:36,500
Please, please, Otacon!

3133
03:25:39,840 --> 03:25:42,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3134
03:25:42,760 --> 03:25:43,780
Put your glasses on.

3135
03:25:47,460 --> 03:25:49,560
Snake is right here.

3136
03:25:52,380 --> 03:25:53,700
I'm done crying.

3137
03:25:54,360 --> 03:25:56,740
I don't have any more tears to shed.

3138
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:59,900
We have to get out of here.

3139
03:26:00,500 --> 03:26:01,280
Any ideas?

3140
03:26:01,960 --> 03:26:04,160
Time's running short, so I'll explain as we go.

3141
03:26:04,600 --> 03:26:05,580
Pay close attention.

3142
03:26:06,260 --> 03:26:07,560
But listen...

3143
03:26:07,560 --> 03:26:09,620
Ok, no time to cry, guys.

3144
03:26:10,420 --> 03:26:11,800
We gotta power Rex!

3145
03:26:19,730 --> 03:26:20,710
Bye, Naomi.

3146
03:26:21,090 --> 03:26:22,610
Rest in hell.

3147
03:26:32,620 --> 03:26:36,680
I wish we'd step on you, just like how your fucking brother died!

3148
03:26:39,040 --> 03:26:40,120
Die, Naomi!

3149
03:26:40,320 --> 03:26:40,780
Suffer!

3150
03:26:42,080 --> 03:26:43,600
Suffer all by yourself!

3151
03:26:44,840 --> 03:26:45,460
Die!

3152
03:26:49,360 --> 03:26:51,300
Gotta have the last word.

3153
03:26:52,460 --> 03:26:53,540
Our will.

3154
03:26:54,120 --> 03:26:54,780
Fuck off!

3155
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:04,140
Always gotta have the last word, Naomi Hunter.

3156
03:27:04,880 --> 03:27:06,600
Goddamn, I hate you!

3157
03:27:11,430 --> 03:27:13,450
Mint is so irrationally mad!

3158
03:27:13,550 --> 03:27:15,390
No, no, this is 100% warranted.

3159
03:27:15,570 --> 03:27:18,970
This is 100% warranted for her.

3160
03:27:19,490 --> 03:27:21,050
She's the worst character.

3161
03:27:22,730 --> 03:27:24,210
She's so bad!

3162
03:27:25,570 --> 03:27:26,930
Perfectly rational.

3163
03:27:27,250 --> 03:27:27,510
Yeah!

3164
03:27:31,110 --> 03:27:32,510
Rationally mad.

3165
03:27:33,090 --> 03:27:33,630
Yeah!

3166
03:27:34,010 --> 03:27:35,650
Yeah, she's like a cockroach!

3167
03:27:36,930 --> 03:27:38,370
And we hate those!

3168
03:27:39,110 --> 03:27:39,610
Yeah!

3169
03:27:40,630 --> 03:27:44,010
She died as she lived, stabbing people with random needles.

3170
03:27:49,130 --> 03:27:53,890
I love while we're back on Shadow Moses, Otacon mirrors, snakes, I have no more tears to shed.

3171
03:27:54,070 --> 03:27:54,850
It's a good moment.

3172
03:27:55,490 --> 03:27:56,830
If not for Naomi's involvement.

3173
03:27:57,110 --> 03:27:58,590
I know, it really is!

3174
03:28:02,310 --> 03:28:03,010
Ding dong!

3175
03:28:03,090 --> 03:28:03,790
The witch is dead!

3176
03:28:03,850 --> 03:28:05,670
That's honestly the best part of this act, too.

3177
03:28:08,450 --> 03:28:09,990
Everything is good in this act.

3178
03:28:10,050 --> 03:28:10,670
We see...

3179
03:28:11,870 --> 03:28:13,590
We get to go back to Shadow Moses!

3180
03:28:15,150 --> 03:28:17,310
We get to see Naomi die!

3181
03:28:17,670 --> 03:28:19,430
And now we get to go pilot Rex!

3182
03:28:21,410 --> 03:28:21,890
Oh,

3183
03:28:25,990 --> 03:28:26,510
oh, gosh.

3184
03:28:27,270 --> 03:28:28,190
How do I shoot?

3185
03:28:28,950 --> 03:28:30,210
How do I shoot this thing?

3186
03:28:30,490 --> 03:28:32,650
Oh, L1, R1 to fire.

3187
03:28:33,010 --> 03:28:33,570
What's this?

3188
03:28:35,670 --> 03:28:36,710
Which one should we do?

3189
03:28:37,330 --> 03:28:39,850
The laser might take too long.

3190
03:28:44,990 --> 03:28:45,750
Oh my god!

3191
03:28:45,830 --> 03:28:47,670
I am pressing, right?

3192
03:28:48,230 --> 03:28:48,850
Yeah, R1.

3193
03:29:01,350 --> 03:29:02,390
My ears!

3194
03:29:02,570 --> 03:29:03,450
My ears!

3195
03:29:03,930 --> 03:29:05,290
Oh my god, my ears!

3196
03:29:05,290 --> 03:29:05,370
My ears!

3197
03:29:18,200 --> 03:29:19,080
My ears!

3198
03:29:21,820 --> 03:29:23,340
Oh my god!

3199
03:29:23,640 --> 03:29:25,620
We're taking the whole place down with us!

3200
03:29:28,360 --> 03:29:30,080
How did I miss?

3201
03:29:32,780 --> 03:29:34,060
Which way?

3202
03:29:36,670 --> 03:29:37,190
This way.

3203
03:29:38,510 --> 03:29:39,330
I'm going!

3204
03:29:43,150 --> 03:29:44,410
Am I gonna die here?

3205
03:29:45,330 --> 03:29:46,010
I hope not.

3206
03:29:47,150 --> 03:29:48,330
Oh, that would be fine.

3207
03:29:48,430 --> 03:29:50,150
I get to just pilot Rex again!

3208
03:30:00,480 --> 03:30:01,500
Shoot all of them!

3209
03:30:02,100 --> 03:30:02,940
Not just one of them!

3210
03:30:03,200 --> 03:30:03,920
Shoot all of them!

3211
03:30:07,380 --> 03:30:09,540
I think I'm not using this thing to its full ability.

3212
03:30:12,320 --> 03:30:13,420
Oh my god!

3213
03:30:13,600 --> 03:30:14,180
What just happened?

3214
03:30:16,520 --> 03:30:17,060
Our health!

3215
03:30:17,420 --> 03:30:18,420
Our health, baby!

3216
03:30:18,980 --> 03:30:19,620
Oh god!

3217
03:30:20,100 --> 03:30:20,640
Oh god!

3218
03:30:24,590 --> 03:30:25,830
I can't hear a damn thing!

3219
03:30:27,410 --> 03:30:28,350
Oh my god!

3220
03:30:28,810 --> 03:30:30,130
Gatlin is better for this one?

3221
03:30:30,170 --> 03:30:30,410
OK.

3222
03:30:33,830 --> 03:30:35,050
Oh, it's unlimited ammo!

3223
03:30:35,350 --> 03:30:36,270
I wish I had known that.

3224
03:30:48,010 --> 03:30:49,790
Oh my god, our health is so little.

3225
03:30:50,750 --> 03:30:51,450
We're gonna die!

3226
03:30:51,990 --> 03:30:52,630
We're gonna die!

3227
03:30:53,090 --> 03:30:53,850
We're not gonna make it!

3228
03:31:19,120 --> 03:31:21,460
I think that was the end, was it not?

3229
03:31:21,900 --> 03:31:23,000
Were we right there?

3230
03:31:28,040 --> 03:31:30,900
OK, we got... I know.

3231
03:31:34,960 --> 03:31:35,720
I'm going!

3232
03:31:36,480 --> 03:31:37,260
We're stomping them!

3233
03:31:37,740 --> 03:31:38,200
We're going!

3234
03:31:46,090 --> 03:31:48,670
Yep, don't worry about it.

3235
03:31:48,990 --> 03:31:50,510
Don't worry about it Otacon!

3236
03:31:51,110 --> 03:31:52,010
I got it!

3237
03:31:54,530 --> 03:31:55,830
Oh my god!

3238
03:31:56,510 --> 03:31:58,070
I've got to handle the Otacon!

3239
03:31:58,190 --> 03:31:58,950
Don't worry about it!

3240
03:32:01,480 --> 03:32:02,640
Oh my gosh, Raiden.

3241
03:32:02,820 --> 03:32:03,720
Don't... Raiden should be

3242
03:33:04,030 --> 03:33:04,290
more.

3243
03:33:04,770 --> 03:33:05,430
So many more.

3244
03:33:05,870 --> 03:33:06,450
Take him down!

3245
03:33:06,530 --> 03:33:06,950
Take him down!

3246
03:33:07,710 --> 03:33:08,550
I can't see anything!

3247
03:33:24,510 --> 03:33:26,530
That's just chaos, it really is.

3248
03:33:28,250 --> 03:33:28,770
OK.

3249
03:33:39,320 --> 03:33:41,200
We were so close before.

3250
03:33:44,060 --> 03:33:44,940
It's time.

3251
03:33:49,200 --> 03:33:52,080
One last fight before the end of the act.

3252
03:33:54,300 --> 03:34:00,380
And what truly makes this one of the best acts in the game... or the best acts in the game...

3253
03:34:00,380 --> 03:34:03,360
This might be the best moment in the game, in this act.

3254
03:34:09,920 --> 03:34:11,760
Get in the robot Mito moment.

3255
03:34:15,620 --> 03:34:16,080
Gosh.

3256
03:34:17,500 --> 03:34:18,460
Raiden, did you make it out?

3257
03:34:18,500 --> 03:34:19,180
OK, he's fine.

3258
03:34:21,420 --> 03:34:22,120
Raiden!

3259
03:34:23,720 --> 03:34:24,500
He's fine.

3260
03:34:49,950 --> 03:34:51,930
Outer Haven!

3261
03:35:02,770 --> 03:35:03,850
Raiden!

3262
03:35:10,030 --> 03:35:11,370
Rules of nature.

3263
03:35:11,630 --> 03:35:11,930
No.

3264
03:35:12,470 --> 03:35:13,710
This is a...

3265
03:35:22,730 --> 03:35:23,270
Oh

3266
03:35:27,140 --> 03:35:28,220
gosh.

3267
03:35:30,020 --> 03:35:30,700
OK.

3268
03:35:30,920 --> 03:35:35,220
Otacon, how do I... Actually, how do I need to...

3269
03:35:37,140 --> 03:35:39,220
How do I...

3270
03:35:44,780 --> 03:35:46,140
Over here.

3271
03:35:56,870 --> 03:35:57,950
You first!

3272
03:36:01,090 --> 03:36:02,490
Oh my god.

3273
03:36:05,470 --> 03:36:07,390
What should we put on you guys?

3274
03:36:07,890 --> 03:36:09,190
What song do you want to listen to?

3275
03:36:10,490 --> 03:36:12,190
What song do you want to listen to?

3276
03:36:15,610 --> 03:36:16,930
Some of the Enders?

3277
03:36:20,900 --> 03:36:21,900
K-Pop?

3278
03:36:22,280 --> 03:36:22,560
What?

3279
03:36:25,120 --> 03:36:27,060
Love to turn to Hell Havoc.

3280
03:36:29,480 --> 03:36:30,960
The game isn't out yet.

3281
03:36:34,780 --> 03:36:36,000
Idol music.

3282
03:36:58,620 --> 03:37:00,380
Get up, Rex!

3283
03:37:01,860 --> 03:37:03,780
This is basically Love to Turrets.

3284
03:37:05,260 --> 03:37:06,300
Where is he?

3285
03:37:06,640 --> 03:37:07,320
Oh, he's over here.

3286
03:37:14,730 --> 03:37:16,170
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

3287
03:37:21,230 --> 03:37:21,790
OK.

3288
03:37:27,110 --> 03:37:28,050
Oh my god.

3289
03:37:28,910 --> 03:37:29,470
Ouch!

3290
03:37:29,990 --> 03:37:30,670
Thank you.

3291
03:37:30,890 --> 03:37:31,230
Thanks.

3292
03:37:33,510 --> 03:37:35,350
I couldn't look for signs.

3293
03:37:35,450 --> 03:37:36,870
He was literally... Oh my god.

3294
03:37:37,370 --> 03:37:37,850
Wow!

3295
03:37:41,610 --> 03:37:43,690
Oh, now you tell me!

3296
03:37:43,870 --> 03:37:44,410
Oh god.

3297
03:37:45,610 --> 03:37:46,610
Seriously, Otacon?

3298
03:38:32,180 --> 03:38:33,800
Should I try maybe another one?

3299
03:38:34,400 --> 03:38:35,780
I want to try the laser cannon.

3300
03:38:36,040 --> 03:38:37,440
Wait, it has to power up though, right?

3301
03:38:46,830 --> 03:38:47,790
Oh shit.

3302
03:38:48,190 --> 03:38:48,430
Ouch.

3303
03:38:54,890 --> 03:38:56,210
Where is he?

3304
03:39:09,700 --> 03:39:16,920
OK, I think... I should have... I should have waited for it, but it's OK.

3305
03:39:29,290 --> 03:39:30,890
Oh shit, I should have dodged.

3306
03:39:31,530 --> 03:39:31,910
No!

3307
03:39:32,550 --> 03:39:33,130
Ouch!

3308
03:39:33,130 --> 03:39:34,070
Ouch!

3309
03:39:35,750 --> 03:39:37,470
He gets one, I get one.

3310
03:39:39,990 --> 03:39:40,670
At

3311
03:40:07,670 --> 03:40:09,530
the peak of the song!

3312
03:40:13,420 --> 03:40:15,120
That was so epic!

3313
03:40:15,740 --> 03:40:17,020
It was so good!

3314
03:40:17,500 --> 03:40:18,380
Oh my god!

3315
03:40:19,160 --> 03:40:21,240
Oh my ears, holy cow.

3316
03:40:21,900 --> 03:40:23,340
That was so awesome!

3317
03:40:23,340 --> 03:40:23,440
No!

3318
03:40:30,500 --> 03:40:34,440
Ray was designed to be a Metal Gear killer, and it couldn't take down Rex.

3319
03:40:35,740 --> 03:40:37,080
Skill issue for sure.

3320
03:40:37,940 --> 03:40:38,340
Oh my god.

3321
03:40:39,220 --> 03:40:40,180
Oh my gosh.

3322
03:40:40,600 --> 03:40:41,640
My favorite part.

3323
03:40:45,700 --> 03:40:46,860
Oh my god.

3324
03:40:47,200 --> 03:40:47,600
Oh my god!

3325
03:40:53,870 --> 03:40:54,790
Nobody say it!

3326
03:40:54,870 --> 03:40:56,170
Nobody say it!

3327
03:40:56,250 --> 03:40:56,950
Wait, wait, wait!

3328
03:40:57,390 --> 03:40:57,810
Don't say it!

3329
03:40:57,930 --> 03:40:58,450
Don't say it!

3330
03:40:58,610 --> 03:41:04,220
Oh my god.

3331
03:41:11,690 --> 03:41:12,210
Fox

3332
03:41:29,410 --> 03:41:30,450
Think again!

3333
03:41:38,720 --> 03:41:40,260
Dead Nash!

3334
03:41:42,260 --> 03:41:43,640
Oh, a stick!

3335
03:41:47,800 --> 03:41:49,100
Think again!

3336
03:41:49,960 --> 03:41:51,200
Oh my god, wait.

3337
03:41:51,540 --> 03:41:52,060
Here it is!

3338
03:41:52,600 --> 03:41:52,920
Yes!

3339
03:41:59,400 --> 03:42:03,200
The best scene ever in a video game!

3340
03:42:21,830 --> 03:42:23,230
Yes!

3341
03:42:23,230 --> 03:42:24,270
Melt Snakemore!

3342
03:42:35,930 --> 03:42:38,790
I love this game!

3343
03:42:45,560 --> 03:42:47,060
Keep going, Snake!

3344
03:42:48,800 --> 03:42:50,680
I will destroy JD!

3345
03:42:51,740 --> 03:42:56,300
Then, everything ends, and everything begins!

3346
03:42:56,480 --> 03:43:00,060
But as for you, brother...

3347
03:43:00,060 --> 03:43:04,280
You'll stay here to mark this island's watery grave!

3348
03:43:04,520 --> 03:43:04,520
No!

3349
03:43:05,380 --> 03:43:07,160
We won the fight!

3350
03:43:08,600 --> 03:43:12,590
Die, Snake!

3351
03:43:28,020 --> 03:43:31,060
My master has been buried under rubble this entire time.

3352
03:43:31,160 --> 03:43:32,420
We didn't even try to help him!

3353
03:43:35,500 --> 03:43:36,060
Raiden!

3354
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:37,560
Oh my god.

3355
03:43:40,200 --> 03:43:40,760
Raiden!

3356
03:43:42,920 --> 03:43:45,680
Oh, it's so pitiful.

3357
03:43:57,260 --> 03:44:01,680
Raiden is a better mom for Sunny than Naomi was.

3358
03:44:07,360 --> 03:44:08,860
Oh, Snake.

3359
03:44:14,750 --> 03:44:15,810
Oh god!

3360
03:44:16,130 --> 03:44:16,830
Snake, move!

3361
03:44:55,210 --> 03:44:56,890
Please, Snake!

3362
03:45:08,640 --> 03:45:09,460
Oh no.

3363
03:45:23,410 --> 03:45:26,250
Yeah, it was in front of Federal Hall.

3364
03:45:26,770 --> 03:45:28,350
There were all these tourists around here.

3365
03:45:29,410 --> 03:45:33,310
They were asking me which building it was that King Kong was climbing in the movie.

3366
03:45:35,190 --> 03:45:37,430
I said it was probably the Chrysler Building.

3367
03:45:38,430 --> 03:45:41,050
And then you showed up and started mouthing off.

3368
03:45:41,110 --> 03:45:43,450
You were like, no, it's the Empire State.

3369
03:45:44,590 --> 03:45:46,810
I said the Chrysler Building was in Godzilla.

3370
03:45:47,810 --> 03:45:51,330
We started arguing, and I forgot all about the tourists.

3371
03:45:51,330 --> 03:45:55,410
The next thing we knew, the tourists had gone away.

3372
03:45:56,390 --> 03:46:00,770
And a week later, I found you again by coincidence out in the base corridor.

3373
03:46:01,730 --> 03:46:02,990
An amazing coincidence.

3374
03:46:03,610 --> 03:46:04,510
Yeah, coincidence.

3375
03:46:04,610 --> 03:46:07,470
That night, we went up to the top of the Empire State Building.

3376
03:46:08,210 --> 03:46:09,970
It was so beautiful.

3377
03:46:11,150 --> 03:46:12,890
I didn't care anymore who was right.

3378
03:46:13,890 --> 03:46:15,510
And that was our first date.

3379
03:46:16,930 --> 03:46:20,270
We watched King Kong in your apartment a bunch of times that night.

3380
03:46:20,270 --> 03:46:21,370
Oh yeah!

3381
03:46:25,550 --> 03:46:27,670
That's what the kids called it back then.

3382
03:46:28,250 --> 03:46:29,550
King Kong all night.

3383
03:46:32,230 --> 03:46:35,790
Oh my gosh, how many people thought that Raiden died there?

3384
03:46:36,870 --> 03:46:40,270
I mean, obviously we know that he did it because of Revengeance, but...

3385
03:46:44,010 --> 03:46:45,510
So it's not a spoiler or anything.

3386
03:46:49,730 --> 03:46:51,430
I thought he did, yeah.

3387
03:46:52,890 --> 03:46:55,870
I kinda wish I had played the game when it came out.

3388
03:46:58,250 --> 03:47:01,150
But I'm also really glad that I got to play it when I did.

3389
03:47:04,550 --> 03:47:06,990
Raiden who wasn't strong enough to lift Ruffalo.

3390
03:47:07,870 --> 03:47:09,050
Don't think about it.

3391
03:47:11,450 --> 03:47:11,970
Raiden!

3392
03:47:13,090 --> 03:47:14,270
Oh, his sword!

3393
03:47:17,970 --> 03:47:19,530
Don't think about it.

3394
03:47:31,780 --> 03:47:33,500
Oh, a snake!

3395
03:48:12,490 --> 03:48:14,910
115 kills, baby!

3396
03:48:18,570 --> 03:48:29,470
Wow, we spent 2 million GP and we still got 100,000 more than we did...

3397
03:48:29,470 --> 03:48:32,470
Almost 100,000 more than we did last week, so...

3398
03:48:33,730 --> 03:48:34,710
Act 4.

3399
03:48:35,630 --> 03:48:39,330
Act 4 I feel is when it starts to really feel...

3400
03:48:39,330 --> 03:48:40,270
Actually, no.

3401
03:48:40,390 --> 03:48:43,830
Act 3 is definitely when it starts to feel super duper...

3402
03:48:45,670 --> 03:48:47,010
Hopeless, I'd say.

3403
03:48:47,890 --> 03:48:48,750
Instinct Night!

3404
03:48:48,910 --> 03:48:49,970
Thank you for the 20 gift!

3405
03:48:50,690 --> 03:48:53,500
Act 3 is when it starts to feel really hopeless and then...

3406
03:48:54,500 --> 03:48:58,300
Act 4 is nostalgia trip until the end and you're just like...

3407
03:48:58,300 --> 03:48:59,640
Oh gosh, it's not good.

3408
03:48:59,660 --> 03:49:00,500
It's not good!

3409
03:49:01,300 --> 03:49:02,720
And then...

3410
03:49:02,720 --> 03:49:04,560
And then...

3411
03:49:04,560 --> 03:49:05,340
Act 5.

3412
03:49:05,960 --> 03:49:06,560
Next week.

3413
03:49:07,400 --> 03:49:09,500
The conclusion of...

3414
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:13,140
Metal Gear Solid 4.

3415
03:49:13,500 --> 03:49:17,180
The conclusion of Solid Snake's timeline.

3416
03:49:21,540 --> 03:49:22,820
Darky, thanks for the 5 gifted!

3417
03:49:24,680 --> 03:49:26,840
I'm wondering if we should save the briefing for next week.

3418
03:49:27,820 --> 03:49:29,280
Darkray, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3419
03:49:29,820 --> 03:49:32,300
Should we save the briefing or should we do it now?

3420
03:49:37,500 --> 03:49:40,040
I think it might be good to...

3421
03:49:40,040 --> 03:49:43,480
You guys, next week, bring your popcorn, okay?

3422
03:49:45,660 --> 03:49:50,240
Bring your popcorn next week because we have some super duper long...

3423
03:49:50,240 --> 03:49:52,000
Cutscenes to go through!

3424
03:49:52,160 --> 03:49:53,960
Thank you for the 15 gifted!

3425
03:49:54,160 --> 03:49:57,500
Thank you so much!

3426
03:49:58,700 --> 03:50:00,200
Now we got a 2 hour cutscene.

3427
03:50:03,980 --> 03:50:10,720
We still have fights to do still, obviously, but...

3428
03:50:10,720 --> 03:50:13,640
My favorite Naomi quote, I'm gonna choose life too!

3429
03:50:16,320 --> 03:50:19,600
Honestly, she just becomes such a villain in this game.

3430
03:50:21,240 --> 03:50:25,980
In Metal Gear Solid, obviously, she's just stupidly annoying.

3431
03:50:26,160 --> 03:50:28,340
You're just like, girl, how long do I have left to live?

3432
03:50:28,540 --> 03:50:30,080
But she's just so hopeful.

3433
03:50:30,540 --> 03:50:38,220
And in this game, she puts such negative thoughts into Snake's brain that it really pisses me off!

3434
03:50:38,920 --> 03:50:40,120
StarCreator, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3435
03:50:43,280 --> 03:50:46,640
She's just so mean in this game!

3436
03:50:46,760 --> 03:50:47,740
She's so mean!

3437
03:50:48,700 --> 03:50:50,300
You hate Naomi more than Rose?

3438
03:50:50,400 --> 03:50:51,860
Oh my gosh, I love Rose, sorry.

3439
03:50:54,340 --> 03:50:59,660
I love the soap opera that is Metal Gear Solid 2, so you can never make me hate Rose.

3440
03:50:59,780 --> 03:51:03,360
Maybe that's a... what's the word?

3441
03:51:06,600 --> 03:51:07,680
A... what's the word?

3442
03:51:08,420 --> 03:51:09,360
What's the word when it's...

3443
03:51:12,420 --> 03:51:12,780
Problematic?

3444
03:51:12,780 --> 03:51:13,460
Not problematic.

3445
03:51:14,740 --> 03:51:15,100
Controversial!

3446
03:51:15,220 --> 03:51:16,940
Yeah, a controversial take.

3447
03:51:17,640 --> 03:51:18,780
Hi, thanks for the 10 gifted!

3448
03:51:19,220 --> 03:51:20,380
And you know what, I'll take it.

3449
03:51:20,520 --> 03:51:24,560
I'll take it as a controversial take, because I know a lot of people are like, I can't stand Rose.

3450
03:51:24,800 --> 03:51:26,740
She's so annoying in MGS2.

3451
03:51:28,760 --> 03:51:31,440
But she's... oh my gosh, it's too funny, I can't hate it.

3452
03:51:34,460 --> 03:51:37,200
The two of them bickering the entire time.

3453
03:51:37,740 --> 03:51:39,460
It's so funny, I love it.

3454
03:51:40,120 --> 03:51:40,880
I love it.

3455
03:51:41,020 --> 03:51:42,360
I can't get enough of it.

3456
03:51:42,740 --> 03:51:43,640
I want more of it.

3457
03:51:43,720 --> 03:51:46,480
I want her to just be like, Jack, why don't you call me?

3458
03:51:47,000 --> 03:51:49,320
And he's just like, Rose, I'm in the middle of battle.

3459
03:51:49,980 --> 03:51:52,380
She's like, also don't call me Jack, my name is Raiden.

3460
03:51:52,860 --> 03:51:55,840
Oh my gosh, Jack, you had no furniture in your room.

3461
03:51:56,900 --> 03:52:00,000
That's so good, I'm dead, but I live for that.

3462
03:52:01,340 --> 03:52:02,260
It's so funny.

3463
03:52:02,980 --> 03:52:06,940
Popcorn funds, I pretty much never buy popcorn, but I definitely will for the next session.

3464
03:52:08,600 --> 03:52:14,500
One good thing about Naomi, after meeting her Raiden never thought of Rose as an egotistical woman again.

3465
03:52:19,820 --> 03:52:22,660
Piloting Rex's catharsis for the Rex boss fight.

3466
03:52:24,440 --> 03:52:26,440
Oh gosh, it's too good.

3467
03:52:27,340 --> 03:52:28,760
It's so funny.

3468
03:52:30,080 --> 03:52:30,600
Popcorn!

3469
03:52:32,780 --> 03:52:34,420
MGS4 Watchalong, yeah!

3470
03:52:36,240 --> 03:52:40,160
But Naomi just feels entirely malicious this entire game.

3471
03:52:40,460 --> 03:52:42,320
I don't care what her intentions are.

3472
03:52:42,780 --> 03:52:47,480
She comes off as so horrible and malicious the entire time.

3473
03:52:47,640 --> 03:52:50,260
And I'm just... I don't even think that the payoff...

3474
03:52:50,960 --> 03:52:54,180
Not to spoil anything, but it's not worth it to me.

3475
03:52:54,260 --> 03:52:57,960
Because she just comes off again, again in the very last part.

3476
03:52:57,960 --> 03:53:02,740
She self inserts herself as the main character.

3477
03:53:03,720 --> 03:53:11,000
She's not a Mary Sue, but she wants to be the all powerful main character.

3478
03:53:13,040 --> 03:53:16,100
She's trying to steal the limelight, she's trying to get the last word.

3479
03:53:16,580 --> 03:53:19,600
She's just so insufferable.

3480
03:53:20,100 --> 03:53:21,680
And she's so mean.

3481
03:53:22,040 --> 03:53:23,880
She's so mean to everybody.

3482
03:53:24,880 --> 03:53:26,680
Poor, poor Otacon.

3483
03:53:27,880 --> 03:53:29,460
Notorious, thanks for the five gifted!

3484
03:53:31,320 --> 03:53:33,680
Thanks for the stream and showing off your alternate colors.

3485
03:53:34,340 --> 03:53:36,620
Act 4 is peak, I love me some mecha fights.

3486
03:53:36,700 --> 03:53:36,980
Yeah!

3487
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:40,900
Yeah, and I don't know if you guys saw, but like...

3488
03:53:40,900 --> 03:53:43,440
When I do this, I become...

3489
03:53:43,440 --> 03:53:44,880
Like, you see?

3490
03:53:45,180 --> 03:53:46,020
I become RGB.

3491
03:53:46,540 --> 03:53:47,800
I can be any color!

3492
03:53:48,520 --> 03:53:50,920
I can be... I can be any...

3493
03:53:50,920 --> 03:53:51,720
Let's see...

3494
03:53:51,720 --> 03:53:57,360
Oh, I can't show you right now, because my monitor is kind of messed up.

3495
03:53:57,960 --> 03:54:01,440
I can cycle... I can be... I can choose anything that I want!

3496
03:54:01,960 --> 03:54:02,600
Yeah, orange!

3497
03:54:02,660 --> 03:54:03,300
I can be orange!

3498
03:54:03,440 --> 03:54:04,180
I can be Wawa!

3499
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:07,980
Thanks for the stream, Boss Minku!

3500
03:54:09,520 --> 03:54:11,420
And we are eating popcorn for the next stream of Metal Gear.

3501
03:54:11,480 --> 03:54:13,020
What flavor should I make?

3502
03:54:13,220 --> 03:54:13,420
Homemade?

3503
03:54:14,420 --> 03:54:14,820
Homemade!

3504
03:54:15,080 --> 03:54:15,780
What's your favorite?

3505
03:54:16,260 --> 03:54:17,320
I like kettle corn.

3506
03:54:18,280 --> 03:54:19,600
But maybe cheese?

3507
03:54:19,600 --> 03:54:21,080
Oh my gosh!

3508
03:54:21,340 --> 03:54:23,440
I might get one of those...

3509
03:54:24,220 --> 03:54:26,040
I might get one of those... Thanks!

3510
03:54:26,260 --> 03:54:26,940
Number one!

3511
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:27,480
Thank you!

3512
03:54:27,940 --> 03:54:36,980
I might get one of those tins that has like the caramel and the regular and the cheesy popcorn in it.

3513
03:54:37,720 --> 03:54:38,780
Sync up snacks?

3514
03:54:38,940 --> 03:54:40,140
Oh my gosh, that's so exciting!

3515
03:54:42,700 --> 03:54:44,640
But I really like kettle corn.

3516
03:54:45,840 --> 03:54:47,180
Cookies and cream!

3517
03:54:48,220 --> 03:54:49,480
Just get your favorite.

3518
03:54:49,840 --> 03:54:50,840
Get your favorite snack.

3519
03:54:52,160 --> 03:54:53,540
Get your favorite snack.

3520
03:54:55,860 --> 03:54:57,780
Man... I love this game.

3521
03:54:58,400 --> 03:54:59,980
I love this game, despite everything.

3522
03:55:00,740 --> 03:55:01,460
I love this game.

3523
03:55:02,720 --> 03:55:05,540
I'm sorry guys that I couldn't get all the...

3524
03:55:05,540 --> 03:55:06,140
Oh wait!

3525
03:55:06,760 --> 03:55:09,180
Before we... Wait...

3526
03:55:13,240 --> 03:55:16,280
We might have... I wanted to do the spirit photography.

3527
03:55:17,580 --> 03:55:20,940
Naomi, like myself, did nothing... Shut up, Huey!

3528
03:55:28,800 --> 03:55:30,120
Preach Dr. Emmerich!

3529
03:55:30,140 --> 03:55:31,920
We don't need two Hueys in the chat!

3530
03:55:33,140 --> 03:55:36,020
We don't need two Huey apologists in the chat!

3531
03:55:43,240 --> 03:55:44,260
Who's Huey?

3532
03:55:44,260 --> 03:55:48,040
Well, maybe you'll find out if you watch Peace Walker.

3533
03:55:49,340 --> 03:55:53,480
And then you'll see why everybody hates him and...

3534
03:55:53,480 --> 03:55:56,060
Well, first we gotta get through Peace Walker and then 5.

3535
03:55:57,660 --> 03:55:58,220
Oh 5!

3536
03:55:58,400 --> 03:55:59,080
Oh 5!

3537
03:55:59,200 --> 03:55:59,740
Oh 5!

3538
03:56:04,180 --> 03:56:05,060
Oh gosh.

3539
03:56:06,060 --> 03:56:07,580
I wanna get back to the main menu.

3540
03:56:07,820 --> 03:56:09,140
I'm gonna press the start real quick.

3541
03:56:09,460 --> 03:56:10,280
And see what happens.

3542
03:56:10,580 --> 03:56:11,460
Save the game, yes.

3543
03:56:11,520 --> 03:56:12,780
Because I do need to save, obviously.

3544
03:56:12,780 --> 03:56:14,900
Thanks for act 4, looking forward to next week.

3545
03:56:14,980 --> 03:56:15,760
Thank you!

3546
03:56:17,400 --> 03:56:19,020
Thank you, thank you.

3547
03:56:27,200 --> 03:56:28,160
One second.

3548
03:56:29,120 --> 03:56:30,560
I might be able to skip it through.

3549
03:56:34,900 --> 03:56:37,920
Oh, it won't even... If I press start, nothing happens.

3550
03:56:38,420 --> 03:56:39,040
No way.

3551
03:56:39,700 --> 03:56:40,280
Hold on.

3552
03:56:41,700 --> 03:56:43,640
Yeah, I wanna view from the main menu!

3553
03:56:45,160 --> 03:56:47,040
Let me view from the main menu!

3554
03:56:52,950 --> 03:56:58,390
I don't necessarily wanna skip because I don't want you guys to see the beginning of the act, but...

3555
03:57:02,230 --> 03:57:03,110
Maybe I...

3556
03:57:03,110 --> 03:57:03,690
I know.

3557
03:57:03,990 --> 03:57:04,470
Here, hold on.

3558
03:57:05,010 --> 03:57:06,810
I'm gonna exit the game.

3559
03:57:07,350 --> 03:57:07,770
Right it.

3560
03:57:08,390 --> 03:57:10,110
Turn off the game console.

3561
03:57:10,370 --> 03:57:11,070
Right now.

3562
03:57:12,030 --> 03:57:13,510
Yeah, we're gonna go to the home button.

3563
03:57:14,170 --> 03:57:16,030
And we're gonna close the game.

3564
03:57:17,310 --> 03:57:18,310
Quit game.

3565
03:57:19,230 --> 03:57:24,810
I gotta turn my date back to...

3566
03:57:25,850 --> 03:57:26,490
To...

3567
03:57:26,490 --> 03:57:28,510
The correct day because...

3568
03:57:29,150 --> 03:57:32,010
Next week, I will be finishing it on Sunday.

3569
03:57:32,850 --> 03:57:34,590
I have something to do next Saturday.

3570
03:57:35,770 --> 03:57:38,510
So, I won't have time...

3571
03:57:41,710 --> 03:57:42,770
To do it.

3572
03:57:46,990 --> 03:57:50,690
So, Sunday will be...

3573
03:57:50,690 --> 03:57:51,690
Why does the date matter?

3574
03:57:51,950 --> 03:57:53,770
Because there's a shop in the game.

3575
03:57:54,030 --> 03:57:57,510
And the shop does discounts on Sundays and Wednesday.

3576
03:57:57,770 --> 03:57:59,370
And I changed the date to be Sunday.

3577
03:58:01,290 --> 03:58:04,450
I changed the date to be Sunday so...

3578
03:58:04,450 --> 03:58:07,630
So that we could get a little bit of extra discount on today.

3579
03:58:07,630 --> 03:58:09,370
When I bought stuff.

3580
03:58:11,330 --> 03:58:12,910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3581
03:58:14,930 --> 03:58:20,770
Oh yeah, and there's even more discount on Act 5.

3582
03:58:21,030 --> 03:58:21,370
Exactly.

3583
03:58:22,290 --> 03:58:24,210
So we'll get so... Wait, does it stack?

3584
03:58:24,490 --> 03:58:27,250
The Sunday discount plus the Act 5 discount.

3585
03:58:29,230 --> 03:58:31,110
The discount is permanent on Act 5.

3586
03:58:31,210 --> 03:58:32,810
But it's a big... Isn't it like 50% off?

3587
03:58:34,730 --> 03:58:36,970
Wait, I'm seeing no and then I'm seeing it stacks.

3588
03:58:38,710 --> 03:58:40,750
I feel like I trust you, Chikado.

3589
03:58:41,330 --> 03:58:42,570
Chikado, Chikado, Chikado.

3590
03:58:43,070 --> 03:58:44,090
Howdy man, cute hair.

3591
03:58:44,170 --> 03:58:44,970
By the way, you got some cookies.

3592
03:58:45,470 --> 03:58:46,030
Thank you!

3593
03:58:46,410 --> 03:58:46,850
Hooray!

3594
03:58:47,650 --> 03:58:48,450
Thank you!

3595
03:58:48,930 --> 03:58:49,890
It's Sunday in Japan.

3596
03:58:50,090 --> 03:58:50,310
True!

3597
03:58:51,330 --> 03:58:52,930
Alright, let's see all my failures.

3598
03:58:54,250 --> 03:58:58,370
Oh, and also some sexy pictures.

3599
03:59:01,130 --> 03:59:01,950
This one...

3600
03:59:02,530 --> 03:59:04,070
Okay guys, look, look, look.

3601
03:59:04,070 --> 03:59:05,930
Look, look, look, look.

3602
03:59:06,630 --> 03:59:09,550
Exercise all ghosts from the photo.

3603
04:00:00,010 --> 04:00:05,270
This is Minto from Beyond Beyond the Grave.

3604
04:00:05,930 --> 04:00:09,150
Thank you for watching today's stream.

3605
04:00:12,090 --> 04:00:18,490
I will show you one last thing before you go.

3606
04:00:19,970 --> 04:00:20,750
Ta-da!

3607
04:00:23,150 --> 04:00:23,970
Oh, sorry.

3608
04:00:25,670 --> 04:00:26,450
Wait,

3609
04:00:33,510 --> 04:00:35,650
I can't get rid of my headband.

3610
04:00:35,770 --> 04:00:36,370
Actually, I can.

3611
04:00:40,540 --> 04:00:42,680
There we go!

3612
04:00:51,130 --> 04:00:51,910
Watcher!

3613
04:00:56,490 --> 04:00:57,270
OtsuMinto!

3614
04:00:59,500 --> 04:01:01,430
See you for Act 5 next week!

3615
04:01:01,970 --> 04:01:02,850
Thank you!
