00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:12,530
Hello everybody, hi, hi, the game, I gotta get, uh, the game is, uh, oh, somewhere.

2
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,670
The game is somewhere, right now we're in the void.

3
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:23,290
Ooh, how spooky the void.

4
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,390
Woo, welcome back to Indiana Jones.

5
00:04:27,470 --> 00:05:29,010
Jones Lego Indiana Jones and today we're gonna finish it we're gonna beat the game baby we're on the last movie so we'll do that and um yeah I love the void you do OBS why did it have to be OBS for those for those wondering why the game isn't up it's because um it's because I updated OBS today and i have a stream deck right okay i have a stream deck which if you don't know what it is it's like uh it's like a little how do you describe it it has buttons it's a it's a thing that has buttons yeah it's a little gizmo hot keys that is actually the best way to put it it's hot keys and you can like you can program it to obs and so like i have my different OBS scenes,

6
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:36,890
which if I were to click something, it would change the scene, but I think the OBS update broke it.

7
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,690
Sad, so sad.

8
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:51,870
And because of the nature of this game, if I click out, if I click out of it, the game messes all up and messes up my computer.

9
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:58,650
So, um, I updated OBS today.

10
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,450
You have chosen poorly.

11
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,590
Don't blame, you're victim blaming right now.

12
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,630
I hope you know that.

13
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,270
You're victim blaming me right now.

14
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,480
This is messed up.

15
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:25,210
It's a...

16
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,250
Imagine trusting OBS updates.

17
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,990
I know, right?

18
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:29,890
My goodness.

19
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,320
But, it's fine.

20
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,660
But...

21
00:06:40,500 --> 00:07:07,120
uh what was i saying um oh yeah now now my hotkeys don't work i wonder if they work here oh they should oh yeah yeah yeah i could still change my hair it's just obs it gives me a big old fat like exclamation point so updating obs is proof that she hates us

22
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,200
Oh yeah, yeah, those exclamation points.

23
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:13,980
Yes, yes, yes.

24
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,400
But, um, I should still be able to play.

25
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,600
Hopefully, hopefully my controller works.

26
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:24,660
That's the thing.

27
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,380
Now, the same thing happened with my Stream Deck.

28
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,280
The solution was to delete and reinstall the OBS plugin, which in turn required me to update the Stream Deck software.

29
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,960
No, I refuse.

30
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,540
I refuse to update.

31
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,340

She hates me.

99
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,450
She's not interested.

100
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:13,590
That's fine.

101
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,070

00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:23,670
It's fine.

106
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,490
One more try.

107
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,790
She's not even looking.

108
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,650
Wait, is this...

109
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:31,910

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,450
Please, please, please.

116
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,250
Hold on.

117
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,050
Look at the way this guy is walking around.

118
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,610
It's so funny.

119
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,150
They all want Goomba.

120
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:58,010
Not Goomba.

121
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,870
Not Goomba.

122
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,130
Wait, one more try.

The hunt for Sir Richard.

164
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,800
Isn't it in here?

Am I thinking of another movie?

00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:24,760
I can't remember.

168
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,300
Hmm.

169
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,020
Minecraft villager noises.

170
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,800

Lego Sean Connery.

175
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,980
Oh, it's this guy, too.

176
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,660
I remember him.

177
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,280
Sean Connery, big boss.

178
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,800
Lego, Lego big boss.

179
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,620
Oh, why are they acting so suspicious?

180
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,500
Well, you weren't reading anything bad, were you?

181
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,480
These Lego turned on?

182
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:21,660
Aha!

183
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,640
Oh, tickets!

184
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,700
They were reading.

185
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm getting thin bucks.

186
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,400
Oh, okay.

187
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,800
Oh, wait, maybe it's her.

188
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,220
That I was...

189
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:41,100
I thought it was Willy that I was trying to go for before, or maybe not.

190
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,620
Gonna show the double dip.

191
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,320
Is Lego not interested?

192
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,420
Oh my god!

193
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:56,760
Oh my god!

194
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,340
Oh my god!

195
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:57,740
Oh my god!

196
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,220
Whoa!

197
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,180
Wait.

198
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,020
No, come on.

199
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:04,780
Take her.

200
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,640
Take her into your arms.

201
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,200
What?

202
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,460
Oh my gosh.

203
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:13,720
Oopsie.

204
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,180
Oopsie.

205
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,720
Wait, how do I get out of the water?

206
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,800
Wait, somebody, please.

207
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,140
Please, I'm Lego drowning.

208
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,860
Someone grab my hand.

209
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:21,660
No!

210
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,080
Wait, how do I get out?

211
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,000
Uh-oh.

212
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,020
Uh-oh.

213
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,200
Wait, she's awesome.

214
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,900
Wait, why did you guys Let's jump in here with me.

215
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,220
Uh-oh.

216
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,320
Uh-oh.

217
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,620
There's gotta be.

218
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,280
Oh, here we go.

219
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:37,580
Here we go.

220
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,020
Here we go.

221
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,100
Hot dog indeed.

222
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:43,580
There we go.

223
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,000
There we go.

224
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,260
Okay.

225
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,060
We're fine.

226
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:46,820
Everything's fine.

227
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,040
Oh no.

228
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:52,740
I forgot to set it so...

229
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,460
I'm so sorry.

230
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,240
I cannot see the...

231
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,320
Oh no.

232
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,320
Because I forgot to set it.

233
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,940
I'm so sorry.

234
00:18:59,240 --> 00:18:59,900
Thank you.

235
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,740
I saw a Goomba fan.

236
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,200
Thank you.

237
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,640
This I can grab.

238
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,620
Alright.

239
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:08,700
Alright.

240
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:12,680
Alright.

241
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,320
What else is...

242
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:15,980
Oh, okay.

243
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,440
Um, where's my hot girlfriend?

244
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,780
She's swimming in circles?

245
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh.

246
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,660
Oh, she wants to go in the gondola.

247
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,400
I get it.

248
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,420
Oh, never mind.

249
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:29,980
I'm her now.

250
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:32,780
Oh.

251
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,860
I thought she can jump higher.

252
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,560
Well, we do need her anyway for this part right here.

253
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,080
Ah, she jumps up here.

254
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,440
Ha ha ha ha.

255
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,240
No, no, no.

256
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,960
Okay, I see that in there.

257
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:50,480
Oh!

258
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,420
I'm getting used to the controls again.

259
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,320
Can I get up even further?

260
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,800
Okay.

261
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,120
Okay, maybe like here.

262
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,720
Oh, dang it.

263
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:10,880
Whoa!

264
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,820
Even further beyond.

265
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,420
Okay, we're gonna do it again.

266
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,640
Hold on.

267
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:20,900
I'm gonna make this.

268
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,780
I...

269
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,260
Oh, wait.

270
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,300
Maybe if I, like, stand...

271
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,340
Oh, okay, hold on.

272
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,400
Like this.

273
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,220
Ah-ha!

274
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:32,740
But...

275
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,360
But, the issue is I don't know how to get inside.

276
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,700
The window?

277
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,210
It's a mystery to me.

278
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,350
It's a mystery to me.

279
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,790
Can she scream?

280
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:57,350
Oh, what's... Yeah, what's...

281
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,010
Oh, uh...

282
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,070
She pulls out a book.

283
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,370
Yeah, that's right.

284
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:07,030
If Willy could scream, she would just...

285
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:09,130
It was horrible.

286
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,210
It was so bad.

287
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:15,850
Okay, good.

288
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,770
We got these now.

289
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,370
She's so...

290
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,670
Her punches are so slow.

291
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,790
It's kind of funny.

292
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,690
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

293
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,510
adventurer because of collecting so much stuff.

294
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,110
Damn, the girls here are stylish.

295
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,790
Oh, oops.

296
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,390
I'm so sorry.

297
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,770
Oh, my God.

298
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,130
Oh, she was a citizen.

299
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,650
Oopsie.

300
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,070
Oh, I don't know my own strength.

301
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,920
Oh, my gosh.

302
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,680
I feel like I could jump onto that.

303
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,780
And I don't know, though.

304
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,560
Oopsie, yep, just a little silly.

305
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
A little silly mishap, you know.

306
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,920
Totally on accident.

307
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,340
What I love about this game is you can literally destroy everything.

308
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,300
What does the book do?

309
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,640
I think it translates stuff, I think.

310
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,240
Oops, oh my gosh, my depth perception.

311
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,220
Sorry, I had to take it out on somebody.

312
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,960
Where's Indy?

313
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,540
See, oh, he's doing laps, too.

314
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,690
Like, I want to jump on that, but I guess I can't.

315
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:02,970
Okay.

316
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,490
I think I can also destroy the Indy.

317
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,050
I can.

318
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,870
There's so much to destroy.

319
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,590
Lap!

320
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,550
Legol!

321
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,570
I feel like Godzilla.

322
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:18,510
Okay, we got this.

323
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,930
Sorry for any KFP watching me game for the first time.

324
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,150
My depth perception is a little...

325
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,210
You could say lacking.

326
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,330
You could say...

327
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,810
You could say...

328
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,470
A little troubled.

329
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,690
Perhaps...

330
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:48,820
Yeah.

331
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,670
What is this?

332
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,730
Oh, oh, Indy!

333
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,410
What does this guy do?

334
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,850
And he's also got his little book, okay?

335
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,710
Wait, it won't let me be Indy.

336
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,350
Uh-oh.

337
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,890
No, Indy, I need you.

338
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,550
Okay, there we go.

339
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,550
Alright, it's your turn in the pool.

340
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,110
In the canals of...

341
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,850
Where are we?

342
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,460
Do you think you'll play other Lego games?

343
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,800
I had this on my DS, and every character had the same death sound in a minigame for children's braids.

344
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,020
I...

345
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,960
Okay, you guys, I'm gonna be 100% honest with you here.

346
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:40,920
Um, I don't know what it is about this game, but it gives me a terrible headache.

347
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,640
I don't know what it is.

348
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,200
Like, I've just kind of been going through it.

349
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:50,420
The first time I noticed it, I thought, oh, maybe I was tired or something that day, but then it happened again the second time.

350
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,500
And I was just like, what?

351
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,700
Oh my gosh, look at the peace!

352
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,000
It's a...

353
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,400
Hoop!

354
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:56,900
Hoop!

355
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:05,720
It's probably the frame rate.

356
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,680
It might be.

357
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,060
It's like... I think it's...

358
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,080
It's really something.

359
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:15,200
I wish I didn't have to play it full screen, because I think that would help me as well.

360
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,780
But the game just...

361
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,320
Oh, I thought they were coming.

362
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,980

We're fine.

364
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,620
Everything's fine.

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,660

Oh, we have some bikes.

Nobody will enjoy this establishment ever again.

379
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,800
Nobody will enjoy the parks.

380
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,100
No one will enjoy the view.

381
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,140
I like the view.

382
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,200
They're my best view.

385
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,560
Everything's fine.

386
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,180
Why won't you let me have a car?

387
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,540
A bike.

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,440

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:15,120
books no we love books what are you talking about Oh, what is this?

392
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,880
I love when they, like, throw hands, but it just...

393
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,720
They don't do anything.

394
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,960
They're like...

395
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,880
But there's...

396
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,600
They don't do anything, you know?

397
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,140
I hate books!

398
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,240
Oh!

399
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:37,880
Library!

400
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,300
Uh, no way that guy was gonna go sit in that one lonesome chair.

401
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,310
Just punch in air.

402
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,710
It looks like they're showing off, but like to who?

403
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,930
You know?

404
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:57,950
Like, who?

405
00:29:58,490 --> 00:29:58,570
Oh!

406
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,170
Ah!

407
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,450
Wait, this is a real secret!

408
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:10,170
I might be the best professor ever!

409
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,870
Oh, nice.

410
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:16,930
If you want to resize the game but doesn't have an option, there's a free program called Sizer.

411
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,930
I've heard of several games, like several programs before.

412
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:22,870
Sometimes they work for me.

413
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:23,930
Sometimes they don't.

414
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,170
But I will look into that one as well.

415
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,190
Thank you so much.

416
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,310
I really appreciate it.

417
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,610
Because, yeah.

418
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,170
There's been like a couple.

419
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:44,920
Sweiser.

420
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,560
I hardly even know her.

421
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,980
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

422
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,640
Oh, wrong way.

423
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,160
Oh, how cute!

424
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,240
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

425
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,940
Okay, this is a two-person operation.

426
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,420
Everybody, please cooperate.

427
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:09,760
No, no, no.

428
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:10,640
Come on.

429
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,060
Come on, everybody.

430
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,940
I could use some help.

431
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,720
Just kidding.

432
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,920
These are some bizarre looking flowers.

433
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,200
I will say that.

434
00:31:30,420 --> 00:32:00,180
awfully funky looking gotta love the music this game this game gets me copyright I think because it uses like the actual theme I get copyright struck every time well it's not like a strike it's like a you can't monetize this game but I'm afraid I was told recently that if you have too many of those like too many of the you can't monetize this game type games or type streams that they will take away your like ships and stuff.

435
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,940
I don't know if that's real or not.

436
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,480
That scares me.

437
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,080
Oh, I like my emotes.

438
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,840
So yeah, maybe I have to be careful.

439
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:23,500
I used to be like, oh, I don't care if a game gets demonetized or whatever, but I might have to be careful about like just for that, you know?

440
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,600
You took so scary!

441
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,080
Yeah, I was talking to my friend about it last night, actually.

442
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,100
She was like, I can't monetize my...

443
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:42,880
Or I can't open memberships because of, like, pre-existing...

444
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,260
What's the words?

445
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,040
Copyright thingamababs.

446
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,430
They're not strikes, I think?

447
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,670
I don't know what to describe it as.

448
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,830
Just, like, claims, maybe.

449
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,010
What's in here?

450
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,590
Oh, hold on.

451
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:11,930
We need a lady's touch.

452
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,710
She got this.

453
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,990
She does not got this.

454
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,570
She's like going around in circles.

455
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:27,830
Oh, actually, I do need you to translate.

456
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:30,910
Ha.

457
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,270
Okay.

458
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,350
Wait, what was it this?

459
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:36,530
Ugh.

460
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,350
Oh, okay, good.

461
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,630
Play Indiana Jones in the Emperor's Tomb.

462
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,590
Except before Indiana Jones in the Temple of Doom.

463
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,550
Kind of rash.

464
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:47,250
Sick bars.

465
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:53,750
Hmm.

466
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,470
Okay, we got the last one.

467
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,090
What are these swords for?

468
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:02,930
Huh.

469
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:03,370
Oh.

470
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:04,890
Oh.

471
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:05,910
Oh.

472
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:06,470
Oh.

473
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:09,830
Do I throw?

474
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:14,450
I think I throw it.

475
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,070
I think there's probably two of them.

476
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:18,170
Two of them, two of them, two of them, two of them.

477
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:19,150
Maybe?

478
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:26,930
Hiya!

479
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,870
Yeah!

480
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:30,670
We're so good.

481
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:33,670
Oh, we're so good at video game.

482
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,410
Oh yeah, baby.

483
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,010
Nope.

484
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,350
Put that book away.

485
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,730
I don't want to read.

486
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,310
Oh, what's over here?

487
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,450
Okay.

488
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,530
All right.

489
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,690
More over here.

490
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,150
Maybe I need a lady's touch.

491
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,270
Okay.

492
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,210
She can jump real good.

493
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:01,550
Nope.

494
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,990
Not good enough.

495
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,310
Cool.

496
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,430
Have you streamed skate?

497
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,390
The new one?

498
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:09,830
Oh my gosh.

499
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:15,430
gosh, I kind of wanted to, but I'm not very keen on it being only online.

500
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,610
You know what I mean?

501
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:19,770
Like...

502
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,880
I don't like that part about it.

503
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,640
Oh!

504
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,540
I got one!

505
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,600
I missed 30 minutes!

506
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,460
Oh, my favorite ghost mid-Eushie playing a game I love?

507
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Ah, you're just in time!

508
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,460
Don't worry!

509
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:52,770
Yeah, I think only online games i mean everybody i think has the same kind of sentiment about it where it's like once the game goes offline you can't play the game anymore and that just sucks you know

510
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:05,210
so yeah i don't know i was like pretty excited about it and then i saw that i was like oh no

511
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,630
That's kind of sad, kind of stinky.

512
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:17,350
Oh!

513
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,210
We just had to be patient.

514
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:21,950
I see.

515
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:23,410
All right, back to Indy.

516
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,110
X marks the spot.

517
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,070
Monkey.

518
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,670
Monkey sounds.

519
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,480
Nice.

520
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,160
what we build in here.

521
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,480
What's up there?

522
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,680
Oh, I don't have a hat!

523
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,200
Dang it.

524
00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,960
So what those things are, are if you wear the hat of, like, the character that's there.

525
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,240
So it would be that hat.

526
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,400
I guess they'll give you something.

527
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,260
I'm not quite sure.

528
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,310
Wait, there's more fountain here.

529
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,730
What is this?

530
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,270
What are these for?

531
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,530
There's so much around here also.

532
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,240
I don't get it.

533
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,480
I actually don't understand it.

534
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,960
Decoration?

535
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,660
No, this is definitely alluding to some sort of puzzle something something.

536
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,940
It's fine.

537
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,520
Oh, we're just causing vandalism.

538
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,620
Wait, are we gonna see, isn't there a little...

539
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,680
What was down here?

540
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,200
This part was kind of...

541
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,060
This part was cool.

542
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,460
It was the rat!

543
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,400
She's such a little trickster.

544
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,340
I guess it's a turnoff for him.

545
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,520
He's like, I hate when my girls play tricks.

546
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,200
I only like when my girls stay sexy.

547
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,140
That was close.

548
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,120
Oh my gosh, okay, that's exciting.

549
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,120
So if we find five skulls, okay, that was a trap.

550
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,020
No worries.

551
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,560
Oh!

552
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:47,520
Oh my gosh, I'm stuck in a death loop.

553
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,820
Oh god, okay, you guys.

554
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,760
Oh, that was bad.

555
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,500
That was pretty bad.

556
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,600
That was quite bad.

557
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,430
This one is definitely has a skelly in it.

558
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:11,850
Oh, okay.

559
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,010
Did not have a skelly in it.

560
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:15,970
Bye!

561
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,470
These are terrifying now.

562
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,810
Wait, did we push it or pull it?

563
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:25,810
Will we pull in it?

564
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:26,170
Hey!

565
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:30,730
Second skellar.

566
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:36,390
Wait, aren't I supposed to dig here?

567
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:36,830
Oh, there we go.

568
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:40,430
Okay, we got a thing.

569
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:43,730
Yes.

570
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:47,110
The music is so mysterious.

571
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,250
This game was my childhood growing up.

572
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,030
First game I have my Xbox 360 along with Kung Fu Panda.

573
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:57,630
Also, Dwargo, thank you so much!

574
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,350
Oh, for the five gifted thank you.

575
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:15,400
Oh, that is quite the platform.

576
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,840
How do I open these up, too?

577
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,420
And then we have this here, another platform, it seems.

578
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,720
Trying to get my brother Dallas to watch you because you love Metal Gear.

579
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,600
He doesn't watch YouTubers.

580
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,860
Could you give him some wisdom?

581
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,020
He doesn't watch V-Tubers.

582
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,160
And you're trying to taint him?

583
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:46,350
He doesn't watch V-Tubers and you're trying to...

584
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,700
Get him to the dark side?

585
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,360
Hmm.

586
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,220
Wisdom.

587
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,440
I do love Metal Gear.

588
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,620
I think Metal Gear is good wisdom.

589
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,300
Oh, neat.

590
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,360
That was such good timing for the music.

591
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,120
I think my wisdom would be stop while you're ahead.

592
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,700
Oh, I thought Indy just exploded.

593
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,720
There's the rats.

594
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:34,740
There's the rats.

595
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,180
Spikes.

596
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,600
Oh, she's afraid of rats.

597
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:42,920
Okay.

598
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,480
Each little character's got their own thing that they get spooked about.

599
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,020
Indy doesn't care about rats.

600
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,500
Oh, yes, he does.

601
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,620
Okay, just kidding.

602
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:56,660
I was wrong.

603
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,340
I was very wrong.

604
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,840
Okay, uh...

605
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,520
What is this thing here?

606
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,800
Oh, my gosh!

607
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,420
I just adjusted the camera a little bit.

608
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,940
I'm gonna lose all of my body.

609
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,160
I see that there, but I don't think I can grab it.

610
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,760
Like the rope up top.

611
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,140
She gets too scared.

612
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,620
She won't do anything.

613
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:31,460
Hmm.

614
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,620
What are the rats gonna do with my money anyway?

615
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,840
What do they want with it?

616
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,000
Well, I'm gonna try and get into there.

617
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,320
Oh.

618
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,380
Maybe Indy can.

619
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:56,180
I give up.

620
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,540
Oh!

621
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,740
There's also here.

622
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,360
Oh, oh.

623
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,280
Oh, see, because there's a blue in there.

624
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,500
Is there anything else I missed over here, or did I get everything?

625
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,440
I thought I got it all.

626
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,020
Oh, my God.

627
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,500
I'm a big old loser.

628
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:27,020
Oh,

629
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,380
okay, we need three more skellies.

630
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,440
Let's see.

631
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,360
Did we see any, um, what's it called?

632
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,360
Torches.

633
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,060
And it torches around.

634
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,820
That I could snatch.

635
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,820
No.

636
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,760
None, it seems.

637
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,020
Can you break those pot things?

638
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,120
I was trying too!

639
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,480
The ones on the wall, right?

640
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,100
Please.

641
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,600
Look how cute the rats are though.

642
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,340
They're kind of cute.

643
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,280
See, it doesn't break.

644
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,260
It looks like it would, right?

645
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,240
Oh my god.

646
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,640
He's so sensitive!

647
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,580
Andy, be careful!

648
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,060
in the end of Jones.

649
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:43,190
He jumped over the gap.

650
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:46,230
I guess that's my only option that I can think of.

651
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,870
Oh, it was not nearly as big as I thought it was.

652
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:51,610
Let's go.

653
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:56,510
Oh, I need her.

654
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:57,330
I need you.

655
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,850
I need you, lady.

656
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:01,130
I don't remember her name.

657
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,680
Good job.

658
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,080
Good job, team.

659
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,150
Yippee!

660
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,470
Oh, it's Elsa.

661
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,210
Elsa, thank you guys.

662
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,090
Elsa Frozen.

663
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,150
What is in there?

664
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,150
Oh, oh!

665
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,530
I think we got our next guy.

666
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,270
Awesome.

667
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,670
Can I destroy him?

668
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,080
Nope, lucky.

669
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:46,680
Let's go.

670
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,600
Onwards, onwards.

671
00:45:52,500 --> 00:46:15,680
okay so we can fall into this water oh good thing someone just got monetization delayed from youtube strike for using a gif i made of you what wait also destruction destruct shan happy birthday relative oh instead of singing happy birthday could you say in a relatively monotone voice happy birthday

672
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,820
Was that good enough?

673
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:30,050
Skelly!

674
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:30,630
Nope.

675
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,050
Just kidding.

676
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:34,970
Oh my god!

677
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:38,730
Indiana Jones, you scared the heck out of me!

678
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,370
Why would you do that?

679
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,350
Oh my gosh!

680
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,490
How did you get up there?

681
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:47,050
Oh!

682
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,070
Scared me!

683
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,550
Is this a timer or...

684
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,880
Oh, okay, it's a timer for that thing, so we don't need to worry about it.

685
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,180
We are all too big for that.

686
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:12,120
Now, what is this?

687
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:15,600
Hmm.

688
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:22,290
What is...

689
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:22,550
Hmm.

690
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,490
What all do we have going on around here?

691
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,230
Oh, I can throw it at the way.

692
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,650
Wait, wrong button.

693
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:38,890
Oops, wrong button again.

694
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,730
Please, please, please, please.

695
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:43,070
There we go.

696
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:44,370
Aha!

697
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:48,890
Nope.

698
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,170
But now what?

699
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,370
Oh!

700
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:56,310
Oopsie.

701
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,420
Oh, there's like a bunch of stuff down there.

702
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,480
Okay, interesting.

703
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,720
Interesting, interesting.

704
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,960
So much stuff around here.

705
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,820
Yeah, collected.

706
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,260
Yeah, just keep collecting.

707
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,600
Yeah, get real close.

708
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,240
Okay.

709
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,700
Oh, I probably need to do it from up here.

710
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,180
Okay, so I need...

711
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:36,320
I need you, Elsa.

712
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,840
There was a web earlier in the catacomb as well.

713
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,560
Wait, I've seen a couple webs.

714
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,380
Anything that you think has been so pertinent that...

715
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:51,500
No, no, why would you do that, you stupid?

716
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,150
What's this?

717
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:08,230
Oh?

718
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:12,310
Oh?

719
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:16,330
Cool.

720
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,270
There was stuff under here, though.

721
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:19,070
Can I dive?

722
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:20,970
Dive, dive, dive.

723
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,250
Oh, I can dive.

724
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:23,870
I think.

725
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:24,850
Was that diving?

726
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:25,550
Yes.

727
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,210
Oh, nice.

728
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,290
Yeah, good job, Bindy.

729
00:49:31,330 --> 00:49:31,930
Can you breathe?

730
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,230
That looks like...

731
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,730
I think I see a skelly in there.

732
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:43,310
Wait, can we get these down here?

733
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,050
The water?

734
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:45,770
I don't...

735
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:46,650
It's like...

736
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,910
I think it's so filled with decomposition.

737
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,550
It's like terrible.

738
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,810
Oh, okay.

739
00:49:55,010 --> 00:49:56,350
I moved them somehow.

740
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,910
I think I have to get them all in one go.

741
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

742
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,270
I have to get it all in one go.

743
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,310
Okay, we got this.

744
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:06,870
We got this.

745
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:10,410
Out of my way!

746
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,420
There he is!

747
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:19,780
Oh,

748
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,040
it's so sad.

749
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,320
Little pathetic guy.

750
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,910
Why is it just so oily looking?

751
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,810
Like, you know, I guess the realism, but they really didn't need it, did they?

752
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:44,730
They didn't need to do it like that, did they?

753
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,480
Where am I pushing this, Joe?

754
00:51:14,370 --> 00:51:15,970
Oh, okay, okay.

755
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:19,990
Oh, no, I'm not trying to play chess.

756
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,410
I think I need to push it onto here, though.

757
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,470
Alright, move, madame.

758
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:28,490
Oh, it's slippery.

759
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,970
Oh, from all the body slime!

760
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:32,370
Ma'am?

761
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:33,430
Ma'am.

762
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,010
It's already tough to walk.

763
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,130
I'm like, slower, you know?

764
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:39,870
Oh.

765
00:51:40,590 --> 00:51:41,870
Oh, the goo!

766
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,050
The goo is doing wonders in here.

767
00:51:47,810 --> 00:51:48,350
Okay.

768
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:49,830
Alright, nice.

769
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:51,190
Just a little bit more.

770
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:52,810
Nice.

771
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,050
A little bit more.

772
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,010
Oh, hi!

773
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:00,650
We got half a stair.

774
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,170
All the ectoplasm?

775
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:06,630
You wish.

776
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,090
This looks like ectoplasm right here, though.

777
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:10,870
Not gonna lie.

778
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:12,630
Looks mighty.

779
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:14,770
Suspicious.

780
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:18,770
How?

781
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,170
Do we get up there?

782
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,910
Oh, I use this guy.

783
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,310
I use this guy's dead body.

784
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:37,630
Maybe her.

785
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,550
Okay.

786
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,570
Oh, nice.

787
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,170
There we go.

788
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,780
It's not yours, is it?

789
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,660
What if it was?

790
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,600
Would you drink the ectoplasm water?

791
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,920
And then this.

792
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,260
Let me just push a little to the left.

793
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:00,840
And then...

794
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,840
And a little forward.

795
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:04,360
And she's in!

796
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:05,280
Nice.

797
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:10,890
Yeah, you would?

798
00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:14,110
Ah!

799
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,410
You don't have to.

800
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:23,980
Whoa!

801
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:25,680
Oh, nice.

802
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,460
Okay, handy.

803
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,860
Oh, wait a second.

804
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,760
Can I even like...

805
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,220
Is this gonna be in the way?

806
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,780
Ah, wait.

807
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,220
Because I think I need this to get up there, right?

808
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:43,220
Maybe?

809
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:44,880
Probably.

810
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,280
Push, push, push.

811
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:49,560
Oh, I can't push no more.

812
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,000
Okay, push, push, push.

813
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,680
Why can't I push it to the left?

814
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,270
Need something mint color for my Vito subshaker.

815
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,450
Thank you for ordering it.

816
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:21,090
There's a little block in front of me.

817
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:21,450
of it.

818
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:22,090
Oh, is there?

819
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:26,290
Oh, gosh.

820
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,490
He pushes so fast, so hard.

821
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:29,750
Okay, hold on.

822
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:31,850
Just a little.

823
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:32,570
Just a little.

824
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:34,470
Maybe.

825
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:38,630
Trying to figure out what they...

826
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,190
I don't think he wants me to jump.

827
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,510
I want to go over there, but I think I missed maybe my window of opportunity.

828
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,180
Ah, I think I did.

829
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:51,820
That's okay.

830
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:01,390
Oh, oh, oh, so not like a gentleman.

831
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:05,970
Oh,

832
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:20,310
wow.

833
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,080
What's going on?

834
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,460
Why are those ladies twins?

835
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,420
Did she just call him over?

836
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,360
Are we just going to allow that?

837
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:39,560
Don't touch me.

838
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,350
Oh my gosh.

839
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:44,310
What was happening?

840
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:48,550
Oh yeah, we gotta get in the boat.

841
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,850
Massacre!

842
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,650
Massacre!

843
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:57,830
Kill them all!

844
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:58,930
Kill them all!

845
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:02,190
This is a long chapter.

846
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,780
We're getting Lego killed.

847
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,240
Nice.

848
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:14,520
Okay.

849
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:18,700
Lego killed, baby.

850
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,880
Oh, never Lego see again.

851
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,240
Oops, fell in the water.

852
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,400
Wait, what's behind here?

853
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:36,680
Nothing.

854
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,660
Hold on, I'm getting all my Lego money.

855
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,280
Elsa the Destroyer.

856
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,040
I mean, she destroyed my trust.

857
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,800
If you've seen the movies, you know.

858
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,320
Spoiler alert.

859
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,500
Elsa, the destroyer of trust and hearts.

860
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:01,140
Alright.

861
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:04,020
Time to pilot a boat.

862
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:06,540
Oh.

863
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,360
Oh, she got it.

864
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,240
Oh, they get their own.

865
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,000
Okay, that's cute.

866
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,360
I want to be indie, though.

867
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,140
Yay!

868
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:15,200
Woo-hoo!

869
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:15,780
Oh.

870
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:17,100
Whoopsie.

871
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:17,480
Oh.

872
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,560
Never mind, just one out of ten.

873
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:19,860
Oops.

874
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,240
Two out of ten.

875
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:34,060
Where did he go?

876
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,720
Oh, that's her.

877
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,700
Okay, you could do anything, Miss Elsa.

878
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,720
You could help at all.

879
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,240
You could have any sense of use.

880
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,100
Urgency?

881
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:49,200
Oh my gosh.

882
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:49,800
Ha-ya!

883
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:53,060
Whoa!

884
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,180
He's on fire!

885
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:56,920
He's on...

886
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:57,040
Oh.

887
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,260
Now I gotta go beat his butt.

888
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,960
Oh, but what about these?

889
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,900
I wanna take down all the...

890
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,160
Hold on.

891
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,260
I'm gonna find them all.

892
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:12,340
Take them down.

893
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,360
Six.

894
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,560
No survivors, miss.

895
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,160
Exactly!

896
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,320
No survivors!

897
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:22,380
No survivors!

898
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,900
Nine and...

899
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,680
Ten!

900
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,060
Let's go?

901
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:41,270
What's over on these sides though?

902
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:43,290
I don't know if we like come back here or...

903
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:51,090
Or if after we take care of this guy we don't get to come back so I don't want to just

904
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,190
Oh, I feel like we must.

905
00:58:58,590 --> 00:58:59,410
This is all broken.

906
00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:03,030
Okay, I feel like we must.

907
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,590
Probably for like...

908
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:09,590
Oh, oh, get in.

909
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:10,310
Oops.

910
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:11,770
Wait, what just happened?

911
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:15,830
Oh, our boat, uh, don't worry about it.

912
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:19,950
I keep pressing Y, but it's not...

913
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:20,510
Okay, there we go.

914
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,270
Oh, oopsie.

915
00:59:22,550 --> 00:59:22,990
Not my bad.

916
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:26,190
I knew that was going to happen, and I still...

917
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,750
It's like a ship graveyard in here.

918
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,370
Boat number two.

919
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,090
We hardly knew you.

920
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,890
We hardly knew you.

921
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:45,230
Boat number two.

922
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,630
We're getting all the good stuff.

923
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:53,290
All the good loot.

924
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:56,030
All right, now let's go kick this guy's butt!

925
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:59,650
Don't!

926
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:01,450
Watch me wobble, okay?

927
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:02,870
It's kind of embarrassing.

928
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:03,750
Hey, where are you going?

929
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:07,590
Why am I just standing here and letting you do it?

930
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:08,730
Hello?

931
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:10,310
What are you doing?

932
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:11,990
A pal!

933
01:00:12,330 --> 01:00:14,870
Oh, come on!

934
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:19,690
Yeah, I'll take you down.

935
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:23,810
I knew it was too easy.

936
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,110
I knew it was too easy.

937
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,660
Sorry I don't always get all the little coins.

938
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:47,680
Sometimes I wish I had, like, a bigger range of pickup, you know what I mean?

939
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:48,640
Hello?

940
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,520
Get in the boat.

941
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,300
There we go.

942
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:56,200
Hello!

943
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,400
Where are you?

944
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:02,020
Hello?

945
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,120
Oh, what is she doing?

946
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,640
Well, she's over there, and that guy's dancing.

947
01:01:14,190 --> 01:01:15,390
Oh, there he is.

948
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:21,680
Nice.

949
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:23,380
Nice, nice.

950
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,520
Oh, there's three of them!

951
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,200
Uh-oh, I think she's in trouble.

952
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,840
Oh, he's gonna run into the...

953
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,420
No, he's not.

954
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,260
I am good at boat chousing, aren't I?

955
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,860
I spoke too soon, maybe?

956
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,440
I think I have to push him in there.

957
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:45,320
Oh.

958
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:54,940
kidding oh hold on man overboard let's

959
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:09,340
go Indy go and sorry I'm

960
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:24,300
blocking her face it's me think of Lego Indiana I don't want to think about that I think nothing

961
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:35,400
my face is better What if I were a Lego lady?

962
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,460
I was so close to being a true adventurer.

963
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:39,800
So close.

964
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:41,780
Dang.

965
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,060
We keep on going.

966
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:53,840
Lego Minto.

967
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,600
That was like the most JPEG image I've ever seen.

968
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:01,100
Oh.

969
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:03,100
Ah, ah, ah.

970
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:03,620
Oh.

971
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,460
Are we not dressed for the occasion?

972
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:10,400
Hmm.

973
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,680
Oh, what is happening?

974
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,080
Wait, what is the point?

975
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:14,980
Oh.

976
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,080
Where did he get the wig from?

977
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:19,280
Wait, what is...

978
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,840
He's so sassy.

979
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,600
What is happening?

980
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,800
Wait, what is the context?

981
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,600
Because I don't remember this in the film.

982
01:03:35,530 --> 01:03:38,750
You're already a mythical block, lady, so you just have to get a little taller.

983
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:40,890
True, true.

984
01:03:46,450 --> 01:03:47,290
Oh, yeah.

985
01:03:52,090 --> 01:03:54,790
The Mona, the Lego Mona Lisa!

986
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:57,770
Oh my gosh, it's so coveted.

987
01:03:59,430 --> 01:03:59,790
Wow.

988
01:04:01,450 --> 01:04:02,050
Wow.

989
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:03,730
We're amongst royalty.

990
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:07,850
Thank you, Lou.

991
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:10,610
Thank you, thank you.

992
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,390
Could a Lego model like...

993
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:16,710
Oh yeah, I've seen her.

994
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,610
I've seen Tenma's Lego model.

995
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,130
It's cute.

996
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,990
I forgot she had one.

997
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,590
Is this a sneaking mission?

998
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:45,360
Why are you shooting actual, like, bazookas in the house?

999
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,440
Oh, my gosh.

1000
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,300
I'm taking your hat.

1001
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,460
Oh, my money.

1002
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,160
My money.

1003
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:52,220
My money.

1004
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:03,570
The music seems appropriate for this situation.

1005
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,890
Oops, sorry.

1006
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,030
Collateral.

1007
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:10,030
She's fine.

1008
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:13,700
She's fine.

1009
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,100
She's fine.

1010
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,300
I feel like the reward is not worth.

1011
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:19,280
Come on, take it.

1012
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,380
One out of four.

1013
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:23,580
Uh-huh.

1014
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,320
I see.

1015
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:24,800
I see.

1016
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,760
Wait, are there special ones?

1017
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,160
Perhaps?

1018
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:30,700
Friendly fire.

1019
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:36,790
Oh, I see.

1020
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:38,070
That one.

1021
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:39,270
Aha!

1022
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:44,310
Yeah.

1023
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:48,110
I'm so good!

1024
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:50,530
He pretended to not be Scottish.

1025
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,970
Well, he pretended to be a Scottish lord in the movie.

1026
01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:54,430
He did not steal her hair.

1027
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,070
That one really just kind of...

1028
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,050
We stole her hair.

1029
01:06:00,770 --> 01:06:02,250
You know, just kind of like, oh.

1030
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:04,350
We stole her hair.

1031
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:05,870
You go up there.

1032
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:07,510
You grab that.

1033
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,870
Nice.

1034
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:10,370
Nice and nice.

1035
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:14,670
Probably need Indy here.

1036
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:17,510
Wait,

1037
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,620
are we going out?

1038
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:23,660
Oh!

1039
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:30,370
Hold on!

1040
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:32,370
There's stuff over here?

1041
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,790
Okay, I can't use this guy yet.

1042
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:37,170
There's, like, a specific character you use here?

1043
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:40,510
No bald doggle.

1044
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:45,870
I guess I mean, Lego people can switch...

1045
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:46,590
Switch...

1046
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:48,690
He's, like, standing here, like, adjusted.

1047
01:06:48,810 --> 01:06:49,110
Look at him.

1048
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:52,690
Lego people can, like, just kind of...

1049
01:06:52,710 --> 01:07:07,370
of switch hair and stuff so i guess it makes sense trying to see what this art is i guess it makes sense it's kind of freaky though hello there we go

1050
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:32,250
before he could bazooka me oh wait i'm so good wait i'm too good Don't think about it.

1051
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:38,310
Grab everything.

1052
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:38,970
Grab everything.

1053
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:40,350
Grab it all.

1054
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:41,190
Oh.

1055
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:46,250
Do I lose the money?

1056
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,270
I think I do.

1057
01:07:48,410 --> 01:07:49,890
I should have switched over.

1058
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:52,930
Before she fell.

1059
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:54,050
Okay.

1060
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:59,110
Yeah, you could just switch...

1061
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,070
That's kind of convenient.

1062
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,450
It's like I'm in the mood for this hat today.

1063
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:03,630
This hair today.

1064
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:05,110
This anything today.

1065
01:08:05,770 --> 01:08:08,350
Must be nice to be a little Lego person.

1066
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:11,610
Do I jump over here?

1067
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:13,890
There's this thing.

1068
01:08:16,590 --> 01:08:18,070
This is quite mysterious.

1069
01:08:19,570 --> 01:08:20,390
Oh, okay.

1070
01:08:21,390 --> 01:08:24,390
I don't know why my first instinct was not to destroy it.

1071
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:30,830
Aha!

1072
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:31,670
Okay.

1073
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:38,780
Such force, Indy.

1074
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:39,840
Ah.

1075
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:40,820
Ah, papah!

1076
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,260
Oh.

1077
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:48,720
Banana.

1078
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:57,920
Oh, my God.

1079
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:58,500
Oh, my God.

1080
01:08:58,720 --> 01:08:59,720
We got double-crossed.

1081
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:07,760
Why are we...

1082
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:39,340
Why are we still still smiling about that though she just betrayed us no why are we like oh it was worth the kiss now we set the whole place on fire oh okay that spread really quickly okay awesome papa i'm in need of your your expertise middle bottom top middle bottom top lift

1083
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,370
I got something.

1084
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,390
Oh, it's a bunch of different weapons.

1085
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:48,610
Okay.

1086
01:09:52,570 --> 01:09:53,050
Okay.

1087
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:56,010
We're still in a bit of a pickle.

1088
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:58,230
Wait.

1089
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:04,230
Are you telling me you wouldn't kiss a woman who betrayed you?

1090
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:07,890
I mean, this depends on how pretty she is.

1091
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:08,570
Oh, sorry, Indy.

1092
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:09,330
Oh, sorry, Indy.

1093
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,410
I'm not saying I wouldn't, but...

1094
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:19,150
Indy, how do we get out of here?

1095
01:10:20,190 --> 01:10:20,690
Indy.

1096
01:10:23,470 --> 01:10:24,510
What does he do?

1097
01:10:25,050 --> 01:10:25,590
Oh, he shoots.

1098
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:27,310
And he scores?

1099
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:33,610
Maybe like this one.

1100
01:10:41,190 --> 01:10:41,590
Oh!

1101
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:48,410
Oopsie!

1102
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:53,770
My money is right there.

1103
01:10:55,910 --> 01:10:56,210
Get it, Eddie.

1104
01:10:56,430 --> 01:10:56,670
Get it.

1105
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:01,250
Lego women be crazy.

1106
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,210
It's them dang Lego women.

1107
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,070
You're so right.

1108
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:05,870
Trying to figure out what to do here.

1109
01:11:08,450 --> 01:11:08,810
Huh.

1110
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:09,510
Okay.

1111
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:15,040
I think I can reach up here.

1112
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:18,420
Oh.

1113
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:22,040
I don't think we can go in the tank.

1114
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,580
but it looks quite engulfed in flame.

1115
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:28,500
Punch the chair?

1116
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,460
It wouldn't let me.

1117
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,980
Oh my gosh.

1118
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:32,800
Now it lets me.

1119
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:38,380
Wow.

1120
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,960
That's quite the contraption we got going on.

1121
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:41,580
Okay, cool.

1122
01:11:45,380 --> 01:11:47,200
All that for...

1123
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,240
All that for just a...

1124
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,460
A ladder.

1125
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:56,160
Papa, are you hot?

1126
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:02,210
Nice.

1127
01:12:04,010 --> 01:12:05,370
I can't destroy those.

1128
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:07,030
But we can.

1129
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:10,730
Oh, there we go.

1130
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:11,770
Ah!

1131
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:15,630
That does something.

1132
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,490
Okay, what does that do?

1133
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,950
Oh, he creates a platform.

1134
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,790
What does this do?

1135
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,470
Oh, there's an even bigger one.

1136
01:12:27,490 --> 01:12:28,250
guy!

1137
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:46,730
Alright, we'll have Papa Pole and Indy needs, oh, Indy, uh, someone needs to be on it.

1138
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:00,690
Okay, I can't go around.

1139
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:04,870
Why would he do it though?

1140
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:12,660
Oh my gosh.

1141
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:16,080
Do we need to like destroy books.

1142
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,440
I think you need something first.

1143
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,200
What else could we get?

1144
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,360
Yeah, spear them books.

1145
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:28,200
Spear them.

1146
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:38,280
Whoa!

1147
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:43,360
Oh, okay, I needed this.

1148
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,020
That's why.

1149
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,380
Aha, aha, aha.

1150
01:13:51,030 --> 01:13:52,870
And then he'll probably...

1151
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:54,130
What is... Raise the roof?

1152
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:55,210
Whoop, whoop!

1153
01:13:56,930 --> 01:13:59,610
The Navy Indy does this.

1154
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,250
Yes.

1155
01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:03,970
Oh!

1156
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:06,470
That was close.

1157
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:08,370
That was so close!

1158
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:10,670
Wait, how'd you get up there?

1159
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,130
How did you do that?

1160
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:14,790
Wait a second, you're not supposed to be able to do that?

1161
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,670
Wait, how did you do that?

1162
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,070
Wait, what was the...

1163
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:20,130
Wait, what was the...

1164
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:21,570
Wait!

1165
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:27,780
I just dropped my phone!

1166
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:30,340
How did he do that?

1167
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:32,840
Man's got hops.

1168
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:34,720
Wait, can I make this?

1169
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,420
Oh, yes, I can.

1170
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:36,840
Nice.

1171
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:46,340
Okay, this is the one that, like, I remember this part in the movie where they, like, are turning the table around and stuff.

1172
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:46,840
It's funny.

1173
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,740
Alright, oh, you, Papa!

1174
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,060
Up, kettle, Left.

1175
01:14:55,880 --> 01:14:55,980
Okay.

1176
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:00,900
Easy, easy, easy.

1177
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,920
Nice, nice, nice.

1178
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:08,200
Oh, we can't go in.

1179
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,020
Ah, I got the troop!

1180
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:10,860
Wait already?

1181
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:11,940
That's kind of crazy.

1182
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:14,120
Oh, wrong way.

1183
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:20,720
If we go?

1184
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,950
Oh, I'm just destroying everything they have.

1185
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:30,570
Kill!

1186
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:33,130
Kill!

1187
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,070
Kill!

1188
01:15:35,850 --> 01:15:39,240
More communication!

1189
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,140
No more technology!

1190
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:43,620
Massacre!

1191
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:44,200
Massacre!

1192
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:44,820
Massacre!

1193
01:15:48,330 --> 01:15:49,480
So satisfying.

1194
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:51,960
It's honestly just actually so satisfying.

1195
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,260
Where does this go to?

1196
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:54,560
Okay.

1197
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,740
His back hurts.

1198
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,520
Is there stuff up here or no?

1199
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,400
Oh here, this one.

1200
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,900
Alright, grandpa!

1201
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:18,430
No survivors.

1202
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:24,670
Destroy all their documents, their secrets.

1203
01:16:25,830 --> 01:16:26,710
Destroy their research.

1204
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:31,510
We built the best boombox ever.

1205
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:35,990
Actually, what is this?

1206
01:16:41,820 --> 01:16:42,390
Oh!

1207
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:45,290
Oh!

1208
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:48,570
All about that base.

1209
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,710
Which museum does Minto belong?

1210
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:58,190
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1211
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:00,330
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1212
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,990
Come on, bye-bye!

1213
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:03,030
Yeah, take him out.

1214
01:17:03,110 --> 01:17:03,550
Take him out.

1215
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:04,530
What is he...

1216
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:05,170
What are you doing?

1217
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:06,950
He's a radio guy.

1218
01:17:07,430 --> 01:17:07,970
Oh my gosh.

1219
01:17:08,090 --> 01:17:09,270
Wait, he's gonna call for backup.

1220
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:14,130
Wait, does he actually do that?

1221
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:15,470
I don't like that at all.

1222
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:16,710
Oh,

1223
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:21,490
I gave him a little nuggie.

1224
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:24,130
And then I killed him.

1225
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:31,790
Friendly, friendly battle between guys, you know?

1226
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:36,910
Yeah, hold on, I'm trying to destroy this.

1227
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:39,470
There we go.

1228
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:45,220
I mean, though, hello, hello, hello!

1229
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,780
Oh, he's got HP, I just noticed.

1230
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,980
We won't let him get away!

1231
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:55,680
Ah!

1232
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,600
I'm shooting everybody.

1233
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:05,460
So nice of them to let me...

1234
01:18:08,940 --> 01:18:12,580
Take care of their other men before taking care of them.

1235
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:17,440
I lost my hide, so I can't do this.

1236
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,420
I always never have a hat.

1237
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:26,800
What museum would I...

1238
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,640
Ripley's, believe it or not?

1239
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,380
Unironically, I would love to be in there.

1240
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,540
I kind of like that place.

1241
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,120
It's fun.

1242
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,020
I think I would love it.

1243
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:38,720
Actually.

1244
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:46,940
Whoa!

1245
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,900
I dodged!

1246
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:50,340
How did I do that?

1247
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,520
Okay, cool.

1248
01:18:54,180 --> 01:18:55,580
Can I blow these up?

1249
01:18:57,380 --> 01:18:58,100
Oh, sorry.

1250
01:18:58,340 --> 01:18:58,780
Sorry, Dad.

1251
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:02,700
Wait.

1252
01:19:03,380 --> 01:19:04,340
I tried to...

1253
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:06,340
Hold on, my aim.

1254
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:07,560
Watch out, Dad.

1255
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:08,180
Watch out.

1256
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:08,380
Oh.

1257
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:13,090
She's fine.

1258
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,370
Okay, no.

1259
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,480
No, I'm gonna lose my gun!

1260
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:24,860
Oh, hold on.

1261
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,080
Stop.

1262
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,540
being weird.

1263
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,640
He's like, I'm gonna sneak around.

1264
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,580
Oh, ah!

1265
01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:35,820
I missed that!

1266
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:37,200
Wait.

1267
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:39,680
Was it over here?

1268
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:41,660
Yes.

1269
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:43,780
There we go.

1270
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,360
Oh, I don't think we should have done that!

1271
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:51,020
Oh.

1272
01:19:52,620 --> 01:19:52,760
Oh.

1273
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:57,660
Yeah?

1274
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:58,480
Okay.

1275
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,280
I killed them all.

1276
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,040
They're all dead.

1277
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:02,360
Everything's good.

1278
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:03,660
We're good, team.

1279
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:05,840
What did that do?

1280
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:08,510
I can't see anything in here.

1281
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,860
Go, Grandpa.

1282
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,080
What did that do?

1283
01:20:19,060 --> 01:20:20,240
I didn't see a hat.

1284
01:20:21,540 --> 01:20:23,000
I don't think there was one.

1285
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:27,660
No hat.

1286
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,340
So sad.

1287
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:30,900
They gave me guns.

1288
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:32,280
No hat.

1289
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:40,000
I feel like I need to blow these up, but I'm not quite sure.

1290
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,140
Oh, dad!

1291
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,640
Watch out!

1292
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:48,800
Oh, okay.

1293
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,580
Maybe one of these guys have a bazooka?

1294
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:54,560
Oh, wait, he has a hat!

1295
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,120
I think it's the wrong hat, though.

1296
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:58,240
Let's try.

1297
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,960
My hat is white.

1298
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:05,440
I think it needs to be a black hat.

1299
01:21:06,180 --> 01:21:07,480
Are they going to kick my butt.

1300
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:12,940
Hello.

1301
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,300
He's nodding?

1302
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:18,580
Just kidding.

1303
01:21:19,060 --> 01:21:19,500
We're in.

1304
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:21,000
We're so in.

1305
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,400
We're so in.

1306
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:25,540
Let's go.

1307
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,300
Dad, watch out.

1308
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:40,240
What did I...

1309
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,640
Is that the bazooka I need?

1310
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:42,360
I think so.

1311
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,640
Okay, perfect.

1312
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:50,750
I don't want to waste it on this guy.

1313
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:54,520
We're fine.

1314
01:22:01,290 --> 01:22:03,350
And can I use it on that?

1315
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:03,590
Wait.

1316
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:05,150
Oh, it did work.

1317
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:06,390
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

1318
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:14,120
Yahoo!

1319
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:18,200
Rocket launcher.

1320
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:21,520
To the rescue.

1321
01:22:22,920 --> 01:22:23,140
Oh!

1322
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:26,580
Oopsie.

1323
01:22:28,060 --> 01:22:29,180
Okay, you can fall.

1324
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:30,400
Be careful.

1325
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,160
Papa, go forward.

1326
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,700
Papa, you're trying to sabotage me?

1327
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,100
He can handle his own down there.

1328
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:40,560
Oh, they're coming up here.

1329
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:41,700
Oh my god.

1330
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,340
Hey, hey, hey.

1331
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:45,120
Oh!

1332
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,420
Papa, move.

1333
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:51,320
I need to get the mothman down.

1334
01:22:52,460 --> 01:22:53,180
I'll take that.

1335
01:22:57,540 --> 01:22:58,100
Mothman.

1336
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,480
Oh, nice!

1337
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:02,600
Wait, I didn't think that would give me a...

1338
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:02,960
Wait.

1339
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:06,200
I need another hat.

1340
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,740
Wait, what happened to my old hat?

1341
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,860
Oh, it's because I died.

1342
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,180
Huh.

1343
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:13,840
Hmm.

1344
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,820
Oh, yeah, I fell and I died.

1345
01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:29,110
Maybe somebody will come back.

1346
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:33,010
Over here.

1347
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:35,950
Maybe if I go up here?

1348
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:41,070
Huh.

1349
01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,630
Oh, what's he doing over there?

1350
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:51,050
Yeah, he's really freaking it.

1351
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,530
Oh, gosh.

1352
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:59,030
The siren will summon another officer.

1353
01:23:59,390 --> 01:23:59,930
Oh, okay, okay.

1354
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:03,510
I just didn't want to walk back over top of this because it scares me.

1355
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,050
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1356
01:24:06,670 --> 01:24:07,450
Oh, I set a bullet.

1357
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:08,510
I just tried to get it out.

1358
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:11,670
Ah!

1359
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,100
Oh, I see the hat!

1360
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:17,600
Please don't kill me.

1361
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:18,520
Please don't kill me.

1362
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,540
Please don't kill me.

1363
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,380
Okay, we're fine.

1364
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:22,100
Everything's good.

1365
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:22,860
We're okay.

1366
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:23,980
Everything's fine.

1367
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,300
Oh, oh.

1368
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:26,380
Scared me.

1369
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:26,880
You scared me.

1370
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:27,140
Okay.

1371
01:24:28,380 --> 01:24:29,280
Don't fall.

1372
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:36,020
Wait.

1373
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,820
Alright, Indy, come over here.

1374
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:42,180
Alright, we're good.

1375
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:42,980
Okay.

1376
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,260
It's not cheap.

1377
01:24:56,980 --> 01:24:57,840
It's not.

1378
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:02,900
No, that's not what I meant to do.

1379
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:04,780
I mean, I guess I could.

1380
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,500
Is there anybody in here to shoot?

1381
01:25:07,180 --> 01:25:08,160
No, I guess we're okay.

1382
01:25:12,650 --> 01:25:14,170
He keeps taking it out.

1383
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,330
Stop it, Indy.

1384
01:25:17,310 --> 01:25:18,670
Well, I need to be Papa anyway.

1385
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:21,150
Oh, wait.

1386
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:27,190
I've never seen this before.

1387
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:29,370
mysterious.

1388
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,800
Why does he keep freaking out like that?

1389
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:44,800
He's scaring me.

1390
01:25:48,820 --> 01:25:50,220
Um, oh, okay.

1391
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,420
Well, cutscene.

1392
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:58,600
The furniture by the entrance seems glowy.

1393
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,400
I need the bazooka to get it, though.

1394
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:03,800
I didn't have it.

1395
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:07,080
I could have gone back and gotten it, but...

1396
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:07,940
It's fine.

1397
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:09,500
It's okay.

1398
01:26:14,140 --> 01:26:16,520
Okay, ready for this terrible noise?

1399
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,820
Okay, here it comes.

1400
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,260
I want to go unlock some guys.

1401
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:23,940
I hope that's okay.

1402
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,610
Hello, Papa.

1403
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:33,790
This is my house.

1404
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:37,330
I reside here in the walls.

1405
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:42,170
Oh, I accidentally just got that.

1406
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:44,330
We got Willy in her pajamas.

1407
01:26:44,350 --> 01:26:51,970
Okay, if we find Willy, like Shirley, the children are cheap.

1408
01:26:54,090 --> 01:26:54,250
But

1409
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,660
I want the radio operator, he was so cute.

1410
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:04,500
But look, we almost have everybody unlocked.

1411
01:27:08,230 --> 01:27:09,970
Oh, wait, can I kiss you?

1412
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:11,750
Please!

1413
01:27:12,450 --> 01:27:15,550
I'm so lonely, I'm gonna keep destroying everything.

1414
01:27:16,530 --> 01:27:17,950
So lonely, I'm so lonely.

1415
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:19,610
Nobody wants to kiss me.

1416
01:27:21,090 --> 01:27:21,690
Why?

1417
01:27:23,970 --> 01:27:25,830
I'll never get the girl!

1418
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:27,630
Oh, snap!

1419
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:32,730
Indy has violent tendencies, everybody.

1420
01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:37,010
Don't... don't follow in his actions, okay?

1421
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,430
He's just sensitive.

1422
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:42,390
It's not good.

1423
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,470
What about one of you?

1424
01:27:50,290 --> 01:27:50,630
One of you?

1425
01:27:50,830 --> 01:27:51,830
Oh, I'm a plant.

1426
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:52,570
Hold on.

1427
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:59,290
No girl will ever love me.

1428
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:01,990
Indie's my role model!

1429
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:06,430
I like how they have different ways of walking.

1430
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,590
Like, it's actually such a small detail.

1431
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,350
That they really didn't have to do anything about.

1432
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:14,170
And yet, they did.

1433
01:28:14,370 --> 01:28:15,050
It's kind of cute.

1434
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:18,530
Now it's all better for him.

1435
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:21,290
Yeah, he's gotta get a little...

1436
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:23,230
Why won't she love me?

1437
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,870
It's because our child is Shia LaBeouf.

1438
01:28:34,900 --> 01:28:36,340
So we escaped.

1439
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:39,820
Handy.

1440
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:48,340
Indy was like, can you just wait two?

1441
01:28:48,740 --> 01:28:50,080
Freaking seconds?

1442
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,100
Papa?

1443
01:28:52,020 --> 01:28:52,600
I swear.

1444
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:00,320
Yeah, Indy is truly maidenless.

1445
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:02,120
At least in these games.

1446
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,880
I don't think he really cares much, though.

1447
01:29:05,560 --> 01:29:10,660
Like, the ladies are trying to be, like, schmoosing on him, and he is just like, uh-uh.

1448
01:29:11,480 --> 01:29:12,500
I don't care.

1449
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:15,740
Put it away.

1450
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:18,080
Put that away, Indiana Jones.

1451
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:18,780
Thank you.

1452
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:25,540
Can I destroy this, too?

1453
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:26,640
Oh, I can!

1454
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:29,440
Oh.

1455
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,100
Oh, there!

1456
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,910
Too busy adventuring.

1457
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:40,830
Adventure.

1458
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:42,750
Adventuring.

1459
01:29:43,890 --> 01:29:44,710
Is that right?

1460
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:45,770
Adventuring.

1461
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,290
Is that correct?

1462
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:50,150
Woo!

1463
01:29:50,490 --> 01:29:51,490
We got a bike!

1464
01:29:59,230 --> 01:30:05,910
I don't think I can put it together yet.

1465
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:06,930
Oh!

1466
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,760
He is an adventure.

1467
01:30:30,350 --> 01:30:33,330
What's wrong with the bike that I just unlocked here?

1468
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:34,770
Oh well this one is broken.

1469
01:30:35,150 --> 01:30:35,990
What's wrong with this one?

1470
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:40,570
It works perfectly fine.

1471
01:30:46,470 --> 01:30:47,510
Adventural ring.

1472
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:55,970
Oh it's just like pushing it along.

1473
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,520
Let's see, what else do we need?

1474
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,280
What else?

1475
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:11,760
I guess we gotta, oh, we need to put the bikes on these, maybe.

1476
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,720
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

1477
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,040
Well, uh, he tapped it, so I guess it's fine.

1478
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh my gosh.

1479
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:28,280
This is the best part when I can destroy everything so easily.

1480
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,360
It feels so good!

1481
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:34,960
It feels so good.

1482
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:37,800
Oh my gosh.

1483
01:31:39,240 --> 01:31:39,500
That

1484
01:31:47,110 --> 01:31:47,550
way?

1485
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:50,370
Nah, I follow my own road.

1486
01:31:51,210 --> 01:31:51,910
Comp it.

1487
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:53,990
So there's this one ride at Tokyo Disneyland.

1488
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:56,070
Sorry, Tokyo Disney Sea.

1489
01:31:56,590 --> 01:31:57,010
I was wrong.

1490
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:00,470
Oh, I need to get off the bike.

1491
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:04,050
Where, um...

1492
01:32:04,050 --> 01:32:05,670
It's called Sinbad.

1493
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:09,670
And it's like the most... It's like Like if...

1494
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:10,470
If...

1495
01:32:10,470 --> 01:32:11,090
What's it called?

1496
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:14,950
It's a small world where any good, you know?

1497
01:32:16,630 --> 01:32:19,190
And they have a song in it that's just like...

1498
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:20,610
It's kind of like...

1499
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,890
The song is just so actually catchy.

1500
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:26,750
Oh, okay, these do hurt.

1501
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:27,510
Just kidding.

1502
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:31,350
And part of it is talking about...

1503
01:32:33,270 --> 01:32:35,210
The compass of your heart!

1504
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:37,770
And the song is like...

1505
01:32:42,450 --> 01:32:44,350
Wait, no, it's...

1506
01:32:45,190 --> 01:33:02,350
Life is an adventure and...

1507
01:33:03,290 --> 01:33:03,470
Oh!

1508
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:04,150
My bike!

1509
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:05,310
Oh, okay, it's fine.

1510
01:33:05,810 --> 01:33:06,090
Just kidding, sorry.

1511
01:33:06,490 --> 01:33:07,130
I didn't mean to scream.

1512
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:09,330
We were never seeing it again.

1513
01:33:09,830 --> 01:33:10,430
I was really scared.

1514
01:33:12,870 --> 01:33:16,450
So yeah, it's like, life is an adventure, and there's no...

1515
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:21,750
There's no map, but you just follow the compass of your heart.

1516
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:23,330
Why did I bring this up?

1517
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,110
Oh, I died.

1518
01:33:27,230 --> 01:33:28,850
Oh, I'm stuck in a death loop.

1519
01:33:29,210 --> 01:33:30,410
Wait, Indy, don't do it.

1520
01:33:30,610 --> 01:33:31,610
Indy, don't do it.

1521
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:33,070
Okay, okay, hold on.

1522
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:45,520
Build up that speed, baby, and...

1523
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:47,300
Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

1524
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:53,080
Okay, how do we do this?

1525
01:33:53,820 --> 01:33:55,020
Indy, do you have a plan?

1526
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:04,200
And the animatronics on the ride are actually so impressive.

1527
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:10,390
Hit the turbo.

1528
01:34:11,810 --> 01:34:12,430
What he's doing?

1529
01:34:12,570 --> 01:34:13,330
Okay, we gotta go.

1530
01:34:14,950 --> 01:34:16,550
Oh, it worked!

1531
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:18,030
Oh, it worked!

1532
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:18,750
Oh, that's a bomb.

1533
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:20,910
That's, that's a, okay, that's a mine.

1534
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:21,610
We got it.

1535
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:21,830
Okay.

1536
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:23,670
Don't worry about the mines.

1537
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:25,910
Don't worry about don't touch the mines.

1538
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:27,250
Don't touch the mines.

1539
01:34:27,710 --> 01:34:28,470
Don't touch the mines.

1540
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:29,350
Indy, don't touch up.

1541
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:29,870
Don't touch up.

1542
01:34:30,210 --> 01:34:30,990
Indy, don't touch the mines.

1543
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:32,550
Wait, what's in there?

1544
01:34:35,030 --> 01:34:35,750
Hold on.

1545
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:36,970
Quick detour.

1546
01:34:41,050 --> 01:34:41,730
Oh, oops.

1547
01:34:42,190 --> 01:34:43,730
Actually, yeah, this is fine.

1548
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:45,410
Oh, don't touch the mines.

1549
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:47,950
Don't die either.

1550
01:34:51,630 --> 01:34:52,250
We're fine.

1551
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:53,930
Okay, probably.

1552
01:34:55,410 --> 01:34:56,110
Another checkpoint!

1553
01:34:56,830 --> 01:34:57,850
Oh my gosh.

1554
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,220
Kill him!

1555
01:35:03,300 --> 01:35:03,760
Kill him!

1556
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:04,500
Oh, Indy, sorry.

1557
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,300
Not you.

1558
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:06,960
Not you, Indy.

1559
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,560
Wait, I needed that heart.

1560
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:11,980
Oh well.

1561
01:35:12,100 --> 01:35:12,460
We're fine.

1562
01:35:12,680 --> 01:35:13,300
Oh, there's that!

1563
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:15,500
So close.

1564
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:16,840
So close.

1565
01:35:16,980 --> 01:35:17,860
We almost didn't get that.

1566
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:19,260
Whose bike is that?

1567
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:19,780
Oh, shoot.

1568
01:35:19,980 --> 01:35:20,660
There's more guys.

1569
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,940
We got them, we got them.

1570
01:35:53,620 --> 01:35:56,080
They'll never have fresh produce again!

1571
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,880
Oh, okay, I forgot that that doesn't do anything.

1572
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:12,060
They'll never eat again.

1573
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:13,880
No survivors.

1574
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:18,600
I really do feel like Godzilla in this game.

1575
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:24,660
It kind of makes me want like a Godzilla rampage type game.

1576
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,000
like this enough.

1577
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:32,000
Oh, more guys?

1578
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:34,720
Leave me alone.

1579
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:35,720
Leave me alone.

1580
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:37,300
I hate it.

1581
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,440
The respawn is like kind of crazy on some of these guys sometimes, though.

1582
01:36:42,280 --> 01:36:42,520
Alright.

1583
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:43,140
Open.

1584
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:46,340
Ah!

1585
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:48,660
Why did we do that?

1586
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,260
Why did we open for more guys?

1587
01:36:50,380 --> 01:36:51,540
Oh, I need his hat, I think.

1588
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:53,500
Yeah, I need his hat.

1589
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:53,800
Okay.

1590
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,120
You mean like Rampage?

1591
01:36:57,260 --> 01:36:58,080
Is there already a GIM?

1592
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:02,760
Is there already a GIM I'm unaware of?

1593
01:37:07,120 --> 01:37:08,200
Rampage N64?

1594
01:37:08,620 --> 01:37:08,800
Oh!

1595
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,480
Thank you!

1596
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:15,300
Good money, good money.

1597
01:37:18,860 --> 01:37:21,420
I don't remember the other parts of the song.

1598
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:22,280
Ouch!

1599
01:37:25,680 --> 01:37:26,260
Oh, I don't know.

1600
01:37:26,780 --> 01:37:27,800
didn't mean to become a plant.

1601
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:29,180
Hold on, how do I get out of here?

1602
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:31,180
Wait, I don't want to be a plant anymore.

1603
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:36,820
Stop!

1604
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:37,580
Uh-oh.

1605
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:39,500
Okay, we're not trapped.

1606
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:39,940
We're fine.

1607
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:45,340
Just a bush.

1608
01:37:50,850 --> 01:37:51,790
What's this doing?

1609
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:55,550
What'd that do?

1610
01:37:57,010 --> 01:37:57,410
What?

1611
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:58,190
What that?

1612
01:37:58,410 --> 01:37:58,990
Oh, gosh.

1613
01:37:59,090 --> 01:37:59,610
Are you okay?

1614
01:38:00,650 --> 01:38:01,850
Oh, I dropped it.

1615
01:38:08,770 --> 01:38:10,710
Oh, it's like another collectible, I think.

1616
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:14,130
Oh my gosh, I have one heart.

1617
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:18,270
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ouch!

1618
01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:20,650
Aim of a...

1619
01:38:20,650 --> 01:38:22,770
Aim of the gods.

1620
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:25,830
What is this?

1621
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:28,770
Oh, that's just a gun, I think.

1622
01:38:28,950 --> 01:38:29,110
Okay.

1623
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:32,510
There's so much going on in this little area.

1624
01:38:39,370 --> 01:38:39,570
.

1625
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:48,010
It's so catchy.

1626
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:50,610
I don't remember the next part though.

1627
01:38:53,330 --> 01:38:53,770
Ah!

1628
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:01,370
The compass of your heart.

1629
01:39:14,730 --> 01:39:14,990
Yay!

1630
01:39:16,230 --> 01:39:17,410
Okay, there was some stuff.

1631
01:39:17,610 --> 01:39:19,190
I see them kind of like chilling in there.

1632
01:39:19,310 --> 01:39:19,690
You see that?

1633
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:20,550
It's messed up.

1634
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:21,870
Oh, okay, the shovel.

1635
01:39:23,210 --> 01:39:26,490
We grabbed this and then there was a shovel area right over here.

1636
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:27,850
Here, here, here.

1637
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:31,190
We dig in.

1638
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:31,650
We dig in.

1639
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:32,850
Dorko, thank you so much for the fire.

1640
01:39:32,910 --> 01:39:33,590
Good to thank you.

1641
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:35,510
What is this?

1642
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:40,490
Nice.

1643
01:39:41,750 --> 01:39:42,650
Oh, my God!

1644
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:43,990
Where did you come from?

1645
01:39:44,230 --> 01:39:45,230
Oh, my gosh.

1646
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:46,890
Okay, you got this, Papa.

1647
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:53,270

01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:43,770
I need...

1652
01:40:45,070 --> 01:40:46,030
A wrench.

1653
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:48,150
Well, where did I get one before?

1654
01:40:50,370 --> 01:40:51,970
And then I also got this.

1655
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:53,150
What do I need this for?

1656
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,970
Hmm.

1657
01:40:56,490 --> 01:40:56,970
Mysterious.

1658
01:41:04,170 --> 01:41:06,150
I don't think there was anything on this side, no?

1659
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:08,030
No.

1660
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,440
I don't remember.

1661
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,460
So there was that thing.

1662
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:20,660
Ah!

1663
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:21,280
Oh, oh.

1664
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,000
That's awkward.

1665
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:31,000
Wait, did I lose?

1666
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:36,040
I thought I lost...

1667
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:37,540
Oh, I did lose the bazooka, I think.

1668
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:39,960
I...

1669
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:42,300
What else have I not done around here?

1670
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:49,020
I mean, there's a few things but I'm like, well, how do I...

1671
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:49,600
Let's see.

1672
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,980
What do I need to blow up?

1673
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:54,860
I don't see any...

1674
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:56,340
There's this thing over here, too.

1675
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,220
I guess we need to get this working.

1676
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,120
Oh, I do blow these up.

1677
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:01,940
Just...

1678
01:42:04,420 --> 01:42:05,300
Stop respawning!

1679
01:42:05,640 --> 01:42:06,640
You guys suck!

1680
01:42:09,220 --> 01:42:09,660
Okay.

1681
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,640
I do need to go back in there, then.

1682
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:14,720
Oh.

1683
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:16,800
I like how...

1684
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:17,980
drops money.

1685
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:19,020
Wow.

1686
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:21,040
Nice.

1687
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:21,840
Okay.

1688
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:22,580
And here.

1689
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:24,180
Grab you.

1690
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:27,920
Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.

1691
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:32,200
And just run past.

1692
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:33,680
Run past everybody.

1693
01:42:35,180 --> 01:42:36,180
We don't care about them.

1694
01:42:37,700 --> 01:42:39,180
Run, run, run, run, run, run.

1695
01:42:39,740 --> 01:42:41,240
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1696
01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:42,540
They are so obsessed with me.

1697
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:42,980
Oh.

1698
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,660
Well, that worked.

1699
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:46,340
Okay.

1700
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:47,800
That worked very nicely.

1701
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:49,940
Grab my money?

1702
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:01,700
Yeah, Jones is superhuman.

1703
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:08,240
Sorry, collateral damage, sorry.

1704
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:14,940
Oops.

1705
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,200
I mean, destroy that, but whatever.

1706
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:19,900
Look at that guy!

1707
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,960
I don't think he cares.

1708
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:21,360
What?

1709
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:22,700
Do you think he cares?

1710
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:26,080
Anyway, we keep going.

1711
01:43:27,660 --> 01:43:28,840
I need my bikes!

1712
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:35,090
Pop on, pop on!

1713
01:43:37,230 --> 01:43:38,290
Ignore everybody else.

1714
01:43:39,330 --> 01:43:40,570
Ignore the elephants in the room.

1715
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:43,790
Okay, hold on.

1716
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:45,090
I'll also...

1717
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:45,490
Hold on.

1718
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:46,970
Okay, you get on that.

1719
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:48,390
I get left.

1720
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:49,790
Okay, you get right.

1721
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:50,370
I get left.

1722
01:43:50,650 --> 01:43:50,950
Oh, shoot.

1723
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:52,070
Oh,

1724
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:57,720
okay.

1725
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,340
Okay, you get left.

1726
01:44:01,980 --> 01:44:02,120
Shoot.

1727
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,960
Oh, no.

1728
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:05,580
Oh, no.

1729
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,040
Papaya, you're like... Okay, I'll get this one.

1730
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:09,420
Yeah!

1731
01:44:14,740 --> 01:44:15,660
Just go!

1732
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:17,780
Oops, I didn't mean to jump.

1733
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:19,420
Oh, my bike is dead.

1734
01:44:19,660 --> 01:44:20,200
Oh, I'm dead.

1735
01:44:29,700 --> 01:44:30,480
Something just exploded.

1736
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:33,160
Oh, there are people literally sinking.

1737
01:44:34,480 --> 01:44:35,780
Um, we could...

1738
01:44:35,780 --> 01:44:35,880
Oh.

1739
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:39,780
Uh, where are the...

1740
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:40,960
Uh-oh.

1741
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:46,100
Wait, oh no, oh, guys, guys, I think we have a problem.

1742
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:48,000
Guys, I think we have a problem.

1743
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,460
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1744
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:55,280
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1745
01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:56,720
Oh, no.

1746
01:44:57,360 --> 01:45:00,320
Okay, let's just run for it a little bit.

1747
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:06,120
And, um, maybe they'll start dropping somewhere.

1748
01:45:06,300 --> 01:45:09,100
Oh, ha, but...

1749
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:10,320
Oh.

1750
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,740
Uh-oh, that doesn't seem good.

1751
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:14,780
Oh my gosh!

1752
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:16,360
I'm trapped.

1753
01:45:22,990 --> 01:45:23,910
Oh my god.

1754
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:26,970
Oh my god, this is insanity.

1755
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:29,090
I'm gonna lose all my money here for sure.

1756
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:29,830
Woo!

1757
01:45:30,690 --> 01:45:31,170
Woo!

1758
01:45:32,190 --> 01:45:34,050
Can I have them shoot the doors?

1759
01:45:35,850 --> 01:45:36,810
What is this?

1760
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:37,810
Oh, there's more!

1761
01:45:39,290 --> 01:45:40,370
Oh, thank you.

1762
01:45:44,290 --> 01:45:44,990
Let's see.

1763
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:48,330
What do we got going on in here?

1764
01:45:50,980 --> 01:45:52,640
It can definitely hit you in here.

1765
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:00,430
Oh, jeez.

1766
01:46:00,970 --> 01:46:01,370
Oh, jeez.

1767
01:46:01,630 --> 01:46:02,730
Why do they give...

1768
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:03,570
Allow them to have guns?

1769
01:46:04,730 --> 01:46:06,810
Okay, if I climb up here, can I...

1770
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:08,810
Okay, I need a bazooka, I'm pretty sure.

1771
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:16,200
Okay, oh, they're just...

1772
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:20,140
Everybody's just flying everywhere, and everywhere, and everyone, and anywhere, and any...

1773
01:46:20,140 --> 01:46:20,840
All the time.

1774
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:21,900
Oh my gosh.

1775
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:22,360
Okay.

1776
01:46:26,420 --> 01:46:27,400
You just try to punch it?

1777
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,600
Yeah, but who cares?

1778
01:46:28,740 --> 01:46:29,400
It's a Lego.

1779
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,920
I've been able to destroy everything until now.

1780
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:35,740
Where's my dad?

1781
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:37,140
Oh, okay.

1782
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:39,220
Oh, this is...

1783
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:39,580
Ah!

01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:40,460
Okay, we got one.

1785
01:46:40,540 --> 01:46:41,020
We got one.

1786
01:46:43,460 --> 01:46:45,380
Oh, I was still able to get it.

1787
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,280
Oh, ish?

1788
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:47,920
Wait, no way.

1789
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:48,760
Oh, my God.

1790
01:46:48,900 --> 01:46:50,280
This is so hard.

1791
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,220

1794
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:29,600
What is this?

1795
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:33,660
Trying to kill the guy in here.

1796
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:51,120
Oh my gosh.

1797
01:47:51,220 --> 01:47:52,020
Oh my gosh.

1798
01:47:52,700 --> 01:47:53,520
It's just insanity.

1799
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,080
It's just actual insanity.

1800
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,180
This is insane.

1801
01:48:01,500 --> 01:48:02,240
My buddy!

1802
01:48:02,860 --> 01:48:03,480
Oh my god.

1803
01:48:03,640 --> 01:48:04,320
We both died.

1804
01:48:04,420 --> 01:48:05,320
We both died.

1805
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:08,080
Oh, they come out!

1806
01:48:08,220 --> 01:48:09,080

1807
01:48:12,640 --> 01:48:15,320
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, okay.

1808
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:17,200
At least I can grab one here.

1809
01:48:17,620 --> 01:48:18,820
This one's crazy.

1810
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:21,200
This one is so crazy.

1811
01:48:23,220 --> 01:48:23,680
No, no, no.

1812
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:24,420
Kill him, yeah.

01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,420
Kill him.

1815
01:48:27,700 --> 01:48:28,140
Kill it.

1816
01:48:28,220 --> 01:48:28,980
Yeah, yeah.

1817
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,420
And then he's gonna come out, right?

1818
01:48:31,420 --> 01:48:33,580
And then he's gonna be like, oh, pew, pew, pew.

1819
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:35,740
Wait, where is he?

1820
01:48:36,780 --> 01:48:37,820
I'll get his ass.

1821
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:41,100
I think I killed him.

1822
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:52,180
This is like a money killer for real.

1823
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,380
Oh my gosh, you just lose everything.

1824
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:57,060
I'm losing it all!

1825
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,160
I'm losing it all!

1826
01:49:00,260 --> 01:49:01,460
Oh, there's no more!

1827
01:49:03,660 --> 01:49:06,160
The winner takes it all!

1828
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:09,640
The loser has to fall.

1829
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,600
Can I take one, please?

1830
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:11,060
Thank you.

1831
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,360
Oh, dang.

1832
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:17,700
I was gaming for a second.

1833
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:23,040
They're bankrupt, Digger.

1834
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,100
What is this dang area?

1835
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,060
Wait, why am I still shooting at that?

1836
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:32,400
Oh, my God.

1837
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:32,820
Oh, my God.

1838
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:33,060
Okay.

1839
01:49:34,220 --> 01:49:36,300
If I die, you die with me.

1840
01:49:38,580 --> 01:49:39,820
I tripped him.

1841
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,140
Please, please let that be enough.

1842
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,020
Please, oh.

1843
01:49:43,820 --> 01:49:44,540
What are these?

1844
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:45,040
What are these?

1845
01:49:45,220 --> 01:49:45,940
What do you need me to do?

1846
01:49:46,440 --> 01:49:47,220
Why are they dancing?

1847
01:49:47,460 --> 01:49:49,780
Why are the flowers dancing?

1848
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:52,960
Okay, I saw there was...

1849
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:53,180
What?

1850
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:54,380
Huh?

1851
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:56,320
No, please, God.

1852
01:49:56,580 --> 01:49:57,600
No, God, please.

1853
01:49:57,820 --> 01:49:59,060
Papa, do something.

1854
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,580
What am I supposed to do here?

1855
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,040
When things dance, you need to build.

1856
01:50:10,180 --> 01:50:12,600
I know, but I'm pressing the build button and nothing's happening.

1857
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,140
I am trying to build.

1858
01:50:15,680 --> 01:50:16,620
Oh, here we- oh.

1859
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:19,300
They want me to build flowers?

1860
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:22,040
Are you serious right now?

1861
01:50:23,180 --> 01:50:23,460
What?

1862
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:23,980
What?

1863
01:50:26,860 --> 01:50:28,320
Is this a real situation?

1864
01:50:43,210 --> 01:50:46,590
They were so tiny that I couldn't even tell that I needed to build anything.

1865
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:49,570
Is this real?

1866
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:54,730
No, please, build.

1867
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:55,650
Please build.

1868
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:02,720
Need a... Oh!

1869
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,800
Oh my gosh, it's for a secret.

1870
01:51:05,760 --> 01:51:06,380
Uh-oh, Papa.

1871
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:07,880
You're fine.

1872
01:51:08,540 --> 01:51:09,480
Oops, I'm not fine.

1873
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,240
Sometimes where it resets you at is, like, messed up.

1874
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:19,600
Let me try the hot, maybe?

1875
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:21,400
But I don't think so.

1876
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:24,500
I don't know why I'm building flowers, you guys.

1877
01:51:24,700 --> 01:51:25,120
I don't know.

1878
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,740
How do I get out?

1879
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,140
Do I need a bazooka for the door, maybe?

1880
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:31,320
Oh, I don't have it anymore.

1881
01:51:31,500 --> 01:51:32,360
They're gonna come out.

1882
01:51:32,860 --> 01:51:34,600
They're gonna come out and they're gonna give me!

1883
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:36,100
Ah!

1884
01:51:39,460 --> 01:51:39,920
Please!

1885
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,280
Oh my god.

1886
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:46,920
I don't know why I, like, live and then I die immediately after.

1887
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:50,760
Finish the turret.

1888
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:52,560
Is it because of that?

1889
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:53,820
Is it actually?

1890
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:55,980
I thought it was done.

1891
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:57,620
I'll try.

1892
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:00,680
Oh, I think Papa just died again.

1893
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:03,560
This one?

1894
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:05,880
Oh.

1895
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:06,960
Wait.

1896
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:08,480
There we go.

1897
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:11,980
Oh my...

1898
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:16,440
It was really that simple!

1899
01:52:17,380 --> 01:52:17,780
Oh my gosh.

1900
01:52:23,540 --> 01:52:24,040
Jump kick!

1901
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,000
Oops.

1902
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:38,860
Yeah!

1903
01:52:41,180 --> 01:52:42,020
Okay.

1904
01:52:42,820 --> 01:52:43,060
Okay.

1905
01:52:43,660 --> 01:52:44,200
They really...

1906
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:46,680
I think they like halved my money.

1907
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:48,220
Even more so.

1908
01:52:49,120 --> 01:52:54,100
I think they, like, took so much of my money.

1909
01:52:58,400 --> 01:52:59,760
That was so...

1910
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,660
That was so rough, man.

1911
01:53:02,220 --> 01:53:04,960
Why did it have to be that difficult?

1912
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:16,420
Ever considered playing uncharted games?

1913
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:18,480
It's on my list of games to play, so yes.

1914
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,200
I really have given her a hat with hair.

1915
01:53:25,260 --> 01:53:25,700
Yeah.

1916
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:28,260
Yeah, pretty lady.

1917
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:29,540
She's like, oh my gosh.

1918
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:31,820
She's really in rubble.

1919
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,400
Planting flowers in a war zone.

1920
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:38,700
I don't want to look at my amount.

1921
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:39,560
Don't tell me.

1922
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:42,260
I'm upset.

1923
01:53:46,040 --> 01:53:48,440
Oh wow, I got a good, I got half of it though.

1924
01:53:48,740 --> 01:53:49,200
It's not bad.

1925
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,120
Indy is just that much of a hunker.

1926
01:53:56,260 --> 01:53:57,280
Yeah, he is.

1927
01:53:58,980 --> 01:53:59,460
Uh-oh.

1928
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:01,740
Very inconspicuous.

1929
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:06,240
Nobody notices.

1930
01:54:07,120 --> 01:54:09,080
Hold on, I'm gonna have a...

1931
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:10,080
a throat mint.

1932
01:54:11,220 --> 01:54:11,900
That's my name.

1933
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:12,700
Don't wear it out.

1934
01:54:13,300 --> 01:54:14,180
Not throat mint.

1935
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:17,100
Wow, she really just took over her hair!

1936
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:17,820
Oh.

1937
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:19,660
Good discovery.

1938
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:21,220
Wait, Indy, you could do the same thing.

1939
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:32,250
Do they have...

1940
01:54:32,270 --> 01:54:32,810
Do they know it's me?

1941
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:38,070
Oh, they're like circling me?

1942
01:54:38,590 --> 01:54:39,850
I guess if I touch them, maybe?

1943
01:54:40,830 --> 01:54:41,530
They'll know it's me?

1944
01:54:43,590 --> 01:54:43,870
Maybe?

1945
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:46,250
I'm actually so confused.

1946
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:51,200
Oops.

1947
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:55,000
Oh, okay.

1948
01:54:55,580 --> 01:54:58,960
So yeah, as soon as I started attacking, they were like...

1949
01:54:58,960 --> 01:54:59,220
Okay.

1950
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:01,960
Don't mind anybody!

1951
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:02,760
Don't...

1952
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:03,460
Wait, what was it?

1953
01:55:03,460 --> 01:55:03,980
What did that do?

1954
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:05,560
Sir?

1955
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:08,580
Oh, I do have to take these.

1956
01:55:28,410 --> 01:55:30,510
Oh my god, everything is just...

1957
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:31,650
What is happening?

1958
01:55:31,850 --> 01:55:33,750
Everything is all happening at once.

1959
01:55:34,350 --> 01:55:36,070
Oh, I did a good dodge there, huh?

1960
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:37,490
I didn't even...

1961
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:38,810
I totally meant to do it.

1962
01:55:39,190 --> 01:55:40,310
So, it was really good.

1963
01:55:52,850 --> 01:55:53,630
Am I...

1964
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:55,970
What is exploding, actually?

1965
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:59,670
I'm not quite sure what the explosions are.

1966
01:56:00,790 --> 01:56:01,630
Oh, I missed him.

1967
01:56:03,030 --> 01:56:03,610
Ow!

1968
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:04,070
Ow!

1969
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:04,990
Stop!

1970
01:56:08,570 --> 01:56:09,730
Stub it!

1971
01:56:11,310 --> 01:56:11,890
Ahaw!

1972
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,460
Oopsie!

1973
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:18,240
Oopsie!

1974
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:26,290
I don't know what the explosions are.

1975
01:56:26,690 --> 01:56:27,790
Yeah, Papa, keep them busy!

1976
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:28,430
Keep them busy!

1977
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:29,510
Wait, where am I?

1978
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:38,230
Ah, dang it.

1979
01:56:40,510 --> 01:56:41,850
The chairs he's throwing?

1980
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:43,550
throwing our explosive chairs?

1981
01:56:44,670 --> 01:56:45,670
It's pretty hardcore.

1982
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:48,870
Ouch!

1983
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,590
Okay.

1984
01:56:50,430 --> 01:56:50,650
No!

1985
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:51,030
Throw!

1986
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:51,430
Indy!

1987
01:56:51,530 --> 01:56:51,670
Throw!

1988
01:56:53,550 --> 01:56:58,690
I'm literally like pressing the throw button and he just doesn't do it.

1989
01:56:58,930 --> 01:56:59,910
So frustrating!

1990
01:57:00,070 --> 01:57:00,470
There we go.

1991
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,010
Finally!

1992
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,190
God!

1993
01:57:05,590 --> 01:57:05,930
Golly!

1994
01:57:11,870 --> 01:57:14,490
Oh, he picked up a hat instead, is that what happened?

1995
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:18,490
Oh, we just...

1996
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:19,430
How did he live?

1997
01:57:20,910 --> 01:57:22,200
Oh, he threw him out...

1998
01:57:23,290 --> 01:57:24,990
Not the two-point turn.

1999
01:57:27,090 --> 01:57:28,960
The blip even has to...

2000
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:44,010
A mosquito in my ear at 2 a.m.

2001
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:49,290
Cool!

2002
01:57:49,910 --> 01:57:51,570
Well, surely they'll never follow us down.

2003
01:57:51,590 --> 01:57:52,210
here.

2004
01:57:54,570 --> 01:57:56,030
We can even...

2005
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:56,930
Useless plane!

2006
01:57:57,310 --> 01:57:57,570
Useless!

2007
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:59,050
Destroy!

2008
01:57:59,330 --> 01:57:59,630
Destroy!

2009
01:58:00,210 --> 01:58:00,370
Useless!

2010
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:01,490
Useless!

2011
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:03,930
Wait, what is this?

2012
01:58:05,290 --> 01:58:07,750
Whoa, I needed to destroy it.

2013
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:10,050
Surely.

2014
01:58:11,170 --> 01:58:14,410
Wait, was I some...

2015
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:15,890
Whoa!

2016
01:58:16,810 --> 01:58:19,150
Wait, I didn't finish exploring that side.

2017
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:23,270
Ah, there we go.

2018
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:25,730
The game was like, we know.

2019
01:58:27,190 --> 01:58:28,350
We know doofus.

2020
01:58:28,670 --> 01:58:31,450
Now get back over there and finish what you started.

2021
01:58:37,460 --> 01:58:38,600
Oh, the lever.

2022
01:58:40,220 --> 01:58:40,700
Oh, the lever.

2023
01:58:41,560 --> 01:58:42,240
Oh, the lever.

2024
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,060
Can you do it?

2025
01:58:51,860 --> 01:58:53,360
Oh, the lever, punk.

2026
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:57,180
1245.

2027
01:59:03,650 --> 01:59:05,130
That's very interesting.

2028
01:59:06,290 --> 01:59:07,170
What could it mean?

2029
01:59:07,750 --> 01:59:08,430
The numbers!

2030
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:10,150
The numbers!

2031
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:11,230
What do they mean?

2032
01:59:22,280 --> 01:59:22,880
Ah!

2033
01:59:24,780 --> 01:59:26,960
I have to probably get...

2034
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,740
I have to make it 1245!

2035
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,140
Ah, but I have to find a little...

2036
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:33,720
Hold on.

2037
01:59:36,140 --> 01:59:37,120
Maybe this here?

2038
01:59:37,820 --> 01:59:39,320
I love that everything pays me.

2039
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:42,120
It's the clock!

2040
01:59:43,080 --> 01:59:43,460
Yeah.

2041
01:59:44,740 --> 01:59:46,640
Gotta get the clock to 1245.

2042
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:49,420
How?

2043
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:54,290
Hmm.

2044
01:59:58,650 --> 01:59:59,610
Oh!

2045
02:00:00,110 --> 02:00:01,890
I just break the clock!

2046
02:00:02,530 --> 02:00:02,810
Yeah!

2047
02:00:04,470 --> 02:00:05,290
Yeah!

2048
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:06,330
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

2049
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:11,230
You just don't need the clock!

2050
02:00:13,310 --> 02:00:13,650
Hahaha!

2051
02:00:15,770 --> 02:00:16,290
sometimes.

2052
02:00:17,030 --> 02:00:17,530
So silly.

2053
02:00:17,730 --> 02:00:18,330
Do I put it here?

2054
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:18,610
No?

2055
02:00:18,990 --> 02:00:18,990
Okay.

2056
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:20,050
Just kidding.

2057
02:00:20,950 --> 02:00:21,750
Where does it go?

2058
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:22,530
It's so heavy.

2059
02:00:24,690 --> 02:00:25,210
Uh...

2060
02:00:25,770 --> 02:00:26,290
Okay.

2061
02:00:26,730 --> 02:00:29,950
Well, now the clock won't work, I think.

2062
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:32,350
I think I messed up the order of operations here.

2063
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:33,990
Indiana Jones.

2064
02:00:34,390 --> 02:00:35,630
What are you doing, buddy?

2065
02:00:39,890 --> 02:00:40,410
Coin!

2066
02:00:40,890 --> 02:00:42,050
Now we can do it.

2067
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:45,430
Are these?

2068
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:47,370
Great.

2069
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,070
What's that?

2070
02:00:52,190 --> 02:00:52,770
Oh my god.

2071
02:00:55,330 --> 02:00:56,290
Oh, they're dropping.

2072
02:00:57,170 --> 02:00:59,890
What the hell

2073
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:06,930
is...

2074
02:01:06,930 --> 02:01:09,510
What is this red thing here?

2075
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:10,490
Grab it.

2076
02:01:10,990 --> 02:01:11,590
There you go.

2077
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:14,090
Oh my god.

2078
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:14,730
Oh my god.

2079
02:01:15,070 --> 02:01:15,630
Oh my god.

2080
02:01:15,730 --> 02:01:16,670
Oh my god.

2081
02:01:17,090 --> 02:01:17,830
Oh my god.

2082
02:01:18,590 --> 02:01:20,430
They're bombing us.

2083
02:01:21,210 --> 02:01:22,290
Oh my god.

2084
02:01:23,750 --> 02:01:24,670
Maybe they are!

2085
02:01:25,610 --> 02:01:27,170
I thought maybe...

2086
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:28,810
They were...

2087
02:01:28,810 --> 02:01:29,930
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

2088
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:33,130
Oh!

2089
02:01:34,430 --> 02:01:37,510
I thought it was like maybe a landmine, but I actually...

2090
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:38,210
Oh my god!

2091
02:01:38,990 --> 02:01:39,970
It's so funny!

2092
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:42,830
It's so terrifying at the same time!

2093
02:01:52,810 --> 02:01:54,790
This game is so...

2094
02:01:54,790 --> 02:01:55,550
What the hell?

2095
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:04,820
Oh my gosh, all that burrow.

2096
02:02:05,040 --> 02:02:05,380
Dang.

2097
02:02:06,940 --> 02:02:07,460
Stinking...

2098
02:02:09,860 --> 02:02:11,540
Here they come from the sky!

2099
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:14,480
Oh my gosh.

2100
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:18,200
Let me have a gun.

2101
02:02:18,900 --> 02:02:19,740
Thank you.

2102
02:02:23,440 --> 02:02:24,340
This is scary.

2103
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:25,260
Oh my gosh.

2104
02:02:25,420 --> 02:02:26,320
Let me out of here, please.

2105
02:02:26,540 --> 02:02:27,980
Not a moment of rest ever.

2106
02:02:30,780 --> 02:02:32,100
Oh my gosh.

2107
02:02:32,260 --> 02:02:33,100
Why do they even...

2108
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:34,660
What's the point of...

2109
02:02:34,660 --> 02:02:36,100
of dropping bombs?

2110
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:37,740
If you're just gonna...

2111
02:02:37,740 --> 02:02:39,260
If you're just gonna...

2112
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:41,580
Also send down men, I don't understand.

2113
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:47,180
What's the point?

2114
02:02:52,340 --> 02:02:56,420
Okay, I think I need to dig, but I don't know where a shovel is.

2115
02:03:03,060 --> 02:03:04,820
Or do I need the parkour here?

2116
02:03:09,620 --> 02:03:13,040
Too whimsical for us literally getting...

2117
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:16,040
Um, you know...

2118
02:03:16,720 --> 02:03:17,440
Rained upon.

2119
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:19,760
Just saying game.

2120
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:22,260
I don't feel very whimsical right now.

2121
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:27,480
The outhouse?

2122
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:31,440
You're a genius.

2123
02:03:32,220 --> 02:03:33,600
Thank you.

2124
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:39,830
Oh wait.

2125
02:03:44,650 --> 02:03:46,010
I see you now.

2126
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:46,650
I see.

2127
02:03:55,660 --> 02:03:56,000
Oh.

2128
02:03:56,280 --> 02:03:56,700
Dang it!

2129
02:04:00,270 --> 02:04:01,310
In obnoxious!

2130
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:01,790
No!

2131
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:07,030
Wait, did we break it with our fat ass just to rebuild it?

2132
02:04:07,470 --> 02:04:08,370
No way.

2133
02:04:09,270 --> 02:04:10,970
Just for me to do this all over again?

2134
02:04:11,850 --> 02:04:12,110
Okay.

2135
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:14,350
Sure.

2136
02:04:17,090 --> 02:04:17,610
Sure.

2137
02:04:18,110 --> 02:04:20,090
Is it only one person at a time, maybe?

2138
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:21,290
Indy, don't do it!

2139
02:04:21,390 --> 02:04:22,170
Okay, thank goodness.

2140
02:04:24,530 --> 02:04:26,490
Indy, you're on your own, pal.

2141
02:04:27,370 --> 02:04:28,730
Wow, the f- Ah!

2142
02:04:31,390 --> 02:04:33,170
It's gonna say the fruits look so ripe!

2143
02:04:36,350 --> 02:04:38,350
Oh my gosh, there's another guy.

2144
02:04:42,660 --> 02:04:44,580
Indiana Jones just rebuilt it, it's Lego.

2145
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,740
I believe in the...

2146
02:04:50,740 --> 02:04:52,060
Oh, how did he do that?

2147
02:04:52,420 --> 02:04:53,960
Wait a second, how did you do that?

2148
02:04:56,240 --> 02:04:57,440
Indy, how did you do that?

2149
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:02,000
How'd you get over here?

2150
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,520
Cute hat, thank you!

2151
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:07,680
I'm Minky Anna Jones.

2152
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:14,670
This looks suspicious, no?

2153
02:05:15,690 --> 02:05:17,790
Like I can parkour up it?

2154
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:18,870
Not parkour.

2155
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:22,810
Maybe it goes to nowhere.

2156
02:05:23,010 --> 02:05:23,750
Okay, let's keep going.

2157
02:05:29,180 --> 02:05:30,280
Oh, not my gun.

2158
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:31,580
Don't waste it.

2159
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:34,960
Okay.

2160
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:36,240
Oh my gosh, again.

2161
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:36,820
Please.

2162
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,200
Please spare me.

2163
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,400
Please spare me.

2164
02:05:39,660 --> 02:05:40,680
This game is...

2165
02:05:40,700 --> 02:05:52,660
ruthless but it's honestly oh my god it's honestly like just so it's so unforgiving sometimes no

2166
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:06,540
what is that oh nice shot papa nice

2167
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:13,690
so funny

2168
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,340
Oh, it's so funny.

2169
02:06:26,160 --> 02:06:27,740
Because it's like so violent.

2170
02:06:28,660 --> 02:06:30,020
Oh my god!

2171
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:33,200
Oh, India died again.

2172
02:06:38,580 --> 02:06:40,980
There's no reason for it to be like this.

2173
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:42,400
Alright, where does this go to?

2174
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:43,580
Okay, I see an arrow.

2175
02:06:44,420 --> 02:06:44,600
Alright.

2176
02:06:52,990 --> 02:06:54,350
Oh, one out of three.

2177
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:55,350
Okay, it's a generator.

2178
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:55,990
Got it.

2179
02:06:56,010 --> 02:06:57,230
Okay, got it, got it, got it, got it.

2180
02:06:58,690 --> 02:06:59,210
Okay.

2181
02:07:00,210 --> 02:07:01,150
Two out of three.

2182
02:07:04,190 --> 02:07:05,530
Okay, nice, nice, nice.

2183
02:07:05,850 --> 02:07:08,370
Papa, I don't need you to stretch in your back every time, okay?

2184
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:11,470
Oh, I'm wasting my gun!

2185
02:07:12,570 --> 02:07:13,950
Put it away!

2186
02:07:14,050 --> 02:07:14,770
Put it away!

2187
02:07:16,590 --> 02:07:19,750
Oh, I need to take this somewhere.

2188
02:07:21,070 --> 02:07:21,970
Where, though?

2189
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:28,260
Oh, it's filling up with...

2190
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:29,900
Uh...

2191
02:07:32,140 --> 02:07:32,560
Horn?

2192
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:45,480
Oh, Indy, Indy, Indy, wait, no, Indy, Indy, Indy.

2193
02:07:46,140 --> 02:07:47,040
You're so limber.

2194
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:47,560
Okay.

2195
02:07:51,380 --> 02:07:51,800
Gold.

2196
02:07:55,140 --> 02:08:00,200
I know sometimes I don't have to do these things, but sometimes I can't tell what I have to do.

2197
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:01,480
What?

2198
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:02,980
What I don't have to do.

2199
02:08:03,060 --> 02:08:03,580
You know what I mean?

2200
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:05,940
Hmm.

2201
02:08:06,160 --> 02:08:06,400
Okay.

2202
02:08:10,560 --> 02:08:11,120
Alright.

2203
02:08:12,020 --> 02:08:12,580
Alright.

2204
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:13,720
Wait, take that.

2205
02:08:14,100 --> 02:08:15,640
That's some good money there.

2206
02:08:16,020 --> 02:08:16,460
Oh my god!

2207
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:16,940
Oh my god!

2208
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:17,660
Oh my god!

2209
02:08:17,940 --> 02:08:18,820
Oh my god!

2210
02:08:20,340 --> 02:08:20,620
Okay.

2211
02:08:20,980 --> 02:08:21,340
Fine.

2212
02:08:22,280 --> 02:08:23,560
Okay, everything's fine.

2213
02:08:28,340 --> 02:08:30,380
Take care of them for your old pops, okay?

2214
02:08:35,320 --> 02:08:36,260
There we go.

2215
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:37,080
Very good.

2216
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,920
And I'll take...

2217
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:41,320
That.

2218
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:42,280
Please.

2219
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:43,100
Please.

2220
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:44,400
Okay.

2221
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:45,260
Nope, please.

2222
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:46,480
Okay, thank you.

2223
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:51,960
Kaboom!

2224
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:54,820
Holy cow!

2225
02:08:55,060 --> 02:08:55,900
Okay, alright.

2226
02:08:56,860 --> 02:08:58,120
Now what did we...

2227
02:08:58,120 --> 02:08:58,660
What was it?

2228
02:08:58,820 --> 02:09:00,400
I mean, did we need to fix something?

2229
02:09:01,680 --> 02:09:03,320
If we did, I did not see.

2230
02:09:03,620 --> 02:09:04,180
Oh, wait!

2231
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:08,690
Oh my god, no!

2232
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:10,170
It's far away.

2233
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:10,890
I think we're okay.

2234
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:11,670
Maybe.

2235
02:09:13,490 --> 02:09:13,810
Oh!

2236
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:22,220
Oh, it opened up a thing.

2237
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:24,120
Oh.

2238
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:25,900
How did he jump like that?

2239
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:27,980
Oh my god, oh my god.

2240
02:09:28,180 --> 02:09:30,140
Oh my god.

2241
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:30,620
Ah!

2242
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:36,240
Okay.

2243
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:37,600
Everything's fine.

2244
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:42,480
Everything's good.

2245
02:09:45,480 --> 02:09:47,080
Baby Gordon, thank you so much for the gift, dude!

2246
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:48,560
First try.

2247
02:09:49,100 --> 02:09:50,780
What is it that needs repaired, though?

2248
02:09:53,540 --> 02:09:54,780
Oh, I see this part.

2249
02:09:54,860 --> 02:09:55,280
now.

2250
02:09:56,140 --> 02:09:56,580
Indy.

2251
02:09:59,360 --> 02:09:59,640
Aha!

2252
02:10:01,960 --> 02:10:02,560
Okay.

2253
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:07,680
All right, all right, all right.

2254
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:11,740
Oh, I thought.

2255
02:10:14,690 --> 02:10:17,110
Okay, now we need to repair something.

2256
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:18,250
Okay.

2257
02:10:20,630 --> 02:10:22,830
I think there was a broken car, was there?

2258
02:10:24,570 --> 02:10:25,410
Let's see.

2259
02:10:25,570 --> 02:10:25,750
Oh!

2260
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:26,770
Yes, you're right.

2261
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:28,710
I think.

2262
02:10:30,570 --> 02:10:32,190
Well, there's a car.

2263
02:10:34,530 --> 02:10:37,690
Ah, it needs a steering wheel, of course!

2264
02:10:41,110 --> 02:10:42,470
Oh, oh, hello.

2265
02:10:43,430 --> 02:10:45,250
The way they come, it's so slow.

2266
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:46,770
Oh my god!

2267
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:53,960
Friendly fire.

2268
02:10:56,720 --> 02:10:59,020
I want this money over here.

2269
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:10,860

02:11:31,460 --> 02:11:37,200

2272
02:11:37,780 --> 02:11:38,560
Bye-bye.

2273
02:11:39,080 --> 02:11:40,300
Have a nice...

2274
02:11:40,720 --> 02:11:41,780
Wait, see you...

2275
02:11:41,780 --> 02:11:43,780
Wait, have a nice summer.

2276
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:45,920
See you next fall.

2277
02:11:47,680 --> 02:11:48,220
Wait, what is...

2278
02:11:48,220 --> 02:11:49,900
Oh, did we have to fight planes now?

2279
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:50,480
Ah!

2280
02:11:56,900 --> 02:11:57,320
Wait.

2281
02:12:11,180 --> 02:12:11,760
Uh-oh.

2282
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:12,820
I'm about to die.

2283
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:15,820
Oh, no.

2284
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:17,320
What's happening here?

2285
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:18,060
Oh, my God.

2286
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:20,980
Oh, bird attack!

2287
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:21,500
Nice!

2288
02:12:24,200 --> 02:12:25,380
We took them out somehow.

2289
02:12:26,040 --> 02:12:27,420
With the bird attack.

2290
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:37,330
Wait, Papa, you... Oh, never mind.

2291
02:12:37,550 --> 02:12:37,810
Just kidding.

2292
02:12:42,550 --> 02:12:43,210
Bird strike.

2293
02:12:43,470 --> 02:12:43,830
Yeah!

2294
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:46,070
It's perfect.

2295
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:47,470
Oh my gosh.

2296
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:51,210
Nice!

2297
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:56,570
It's so funny that they die to their own things.

2298
02:12:57,450 --> 02:12:59,070
Alright, nice, nice, nice.

2299
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:02,710
I mean, it makes sense.

2300
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:07,070
It would actually make me very upset if they didn't because that would be...

2301
02:13:07,630 --> 02:13:09,390
Uh-oh, wait, did I lose the shovel?

2302
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:12,590
Oh, I lost my shovel.

2303
02:13:13,890 --> 02:13:15,350
Oh, no, I lost my shovel.

2304
02:13:16,030 --> 02:13:16,930
No, I didn't!

2305
02:13:25,990 --> 02:13:27,870
This beach is huge!

2306
02:13:30,150 --> 02:13:31,730
New shovel, new shovel!

2307
02:13:42,190 --> 02:13:43,090
Papa, papa!

2308
02:13:43,390 --> 02:13:43,830
Watch out, papa.

2309
02:13:45,010 --> 02:13:46,910
Don't stand so close.

2310
02:13:50,500 --> 02:13:51,580
Anything in here?

2311
02:13:52,740 --> 02:13:54,400
These houses are so small.

2312
02:13:59,870 --> 02:14:01,990
I didn't see a third one.

2313
02:14:02,490 --> 02:14:02,510
Hmm.

2314
02:14:04,250 --> 02:14:06,150
I guess it's hidden somewhere.

2315
02:14:08,410 --> 02:14:09,290
Oh my gosh.

2316
02:14:09,730 --> 02:14:10,910
I can't jump.

2317
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:11,710
There we go.

2318
02:14:12,030 --> 02:14:12,190
Wait.

2319
02:14:12,850 --> 02:14:14,590
Oh my god.

2320
02:14:14,910 --> 02:14:15,390
Papa!

2321
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:15,970
Papa!

2322
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:25,360
We're fine, everything's good, everything's chill and cool.

2323
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:28,680
Oh my gosh.

2324
02:14:29,460 --> 02:14:30,960
If I could...

2325
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:33,240
If I knew how to do anything, actually...

2326
02:14:33,240 --> 02:14:35,060
Get out of my way!

2327
02:14:36,160 --> 02:14:38,340
He's like, I'll show you how to do it, son.

2328
02:14:39,900 --> 02:14:43,860
Oh, I have to show you how to do it, son.

2329
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:48,320
Oh,

2330
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:52,060
I am.

2331
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:53,700
We almost had it.

2332
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:55,440
Wait, oh no!

2333
02:14:57,960 --> 02:14:59,660
Um, that's not good.

2334
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:20,810
Second bird strike!

2335
02:15:24,390 --> 02:15:24,710
Ah!

2336
02:15:27,850 --> 02:15:30,850
But like, where- well, how are they dropping the guys?

2337
02:15:31,050 --> 02:15:31,850
That's what I wonder.

2338
02:15:34,630 --> 02:15:35,310
How?

2339
02:15:39,140 --> 02:15:39,860
Wait, where's my dad?

2340
02:15:39,960 --> 02:15:40,400
Oh, there he is.

2341
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:46,140
Now we need to find the third set of birds.

2342
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:47,840
Probably on the other side, I imagine.

2343
02:15:51,740 --> 02:15:51,840
Oh.

2344
02:15:52,240 --> 02:15:52,440
Hello.

2345
02:15:56,920 --> 02:15:57,580
All right.

2346
02:15:58,220 --> 02:15:59,480
Over here, probably.

2347
02:16:01,340 --> 02:16:03,000
I forgot there was another side.

2348
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:08,480
I also need more...

2349
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:08,980
Oh, here we go.

2350
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,660
I need more health.

2351
02:16:15,060 --> 02:16:15,580
Gibby!

2352
02:16:17,440 --> 02:16:18,080
Oh, there it is.

2353
02:16:18,160 --> 02:16:19,200
I was like, what did it give me?

2354
02:16:23,200 --> 02:16:24,940
I hear birds.

2355
02:16:27,020 --> 02:16:28,500
I hear birds.

2356
02:16:29,740 --> 02:16:31,500
My ears do not deceive.

2357
02:16:31,880 --> 02:16:32,420
Oh, there they are.

2358
02:16:32,660 --> 02:16:32,660
Okay.

2359
02:16:34,180 --> 02:16:35,420
Surely they can't land.

2360
02:16:35,720 --> 02:16:36,680
Okay, on the boat.

2361
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:40,060
If I'm tall enough.

2362
02:16:43,580 --> 02:16:44,060
Woohoo!

2363
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:45,900
True Adventurer, baby!

2364
02:16:46,520 --> 02:16:46,800
Nice.

2365
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,480
Get these pesky planes out of the way.

2366
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:19,500
Oh my gosh, I almost didn't get True Adventurer.

2367
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:21,420
Didn't I?

2368
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:22,740
It was the end of the level.

2369
02:17:24,500 --> 02:17:26,260
Here comes the terrible sound!

2370
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:27,800
Here it comes!

2371
02:17:33,960 --> 02:17:36,300
We got quite a few of these as well.

2372
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:37,740
I think like five?

2373
02:17:38,080 --> 02:17:38,880
Yeah, nice.

2374
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:42,740
Hold on, I'm gonna go unlock more people.

2375
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:45,420
Here it comes!

2376
02:17:51,140 --> 02:17:52,500
Let's unlock more people!

2377
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,520
Because Elsa has an office...

2378
02:17:58,520 --> 02:17:59,820
Wait, I really want this guy.

2379
02:18:04,980 --> 02:18:06,180
Bald Elsa!

2380
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:13,120
Bald Elsa!

2381
02:18:16,280 --> 02:18:17,360
Fresh officer!

2382
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:18,560
Oh, I don't have another money yet.

2383
02:18:20,580 --> 02:18:21,240
Yeah, nice.

2384
02:18:24,320 --> 02:18:26,580
Wait, we unlocked Bald Elsa, right?

2385
02:18:26,640 --> 02:18:27,560
Wait, can I...

2386
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:28,800
No, please!

2387
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:31,720
Why won't anyone kiss me?

2388
02:18:34,520 --> 02:18:35,100
Please!

2389
02:18:35,800 --> 02:18:36,160
Please!

2390
02:18:38,560 --> 02:18:38,940
Please!

2391
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:39,360
Please!

2392
02:18:44,120 --> 02:18:44,700
Why?

2393
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:46,780
I'm so lonely!

2394
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:48,020
I'm so lonely!

2395
02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:49,060
I'm so lonely!

2396
02:18:49,200 --> 02:18:49,880
I could kill somebody!

2397
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:51,720
Wait, I saw a woman.

2398
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:55,000
Where'd she go?

2399
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:55,280
Oh!

2400
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:58,200
Oh yeah, this is my original character, you guys.

2401
02:18:58,320 --> 02:18:59,100
Isn't he so cool?

2402
02:19:01,280 --> 02:19:02,160
Hi, Minto.

2403
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:02,600
Hi!

2404
02:19:16,390 --> 02:19:18,050
We got the girl!

2405
02:19:18,950 --> 02:19:20,390
We got the girl!

2406
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:24,810
She does love me!

2407
02:19:25,850 --> 02:19:26,850
Wait, stranger.

2408
02:19:27,730 --> 02:19:28,170
Danger.

2409
02:19:29,910 --> 02:19:32,190
Maybe she has to be looking at me.

2410
02:19:33,850 --> 02:19:37,130
Wait, watch, watch, watch this, watch this, watch this.

2411
02:19:37,230 --> 02:19:38,510
Watch this, watch this.

2412
02:19:39,810 --> 02:19:40,430
Watch this.

2413
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:41,650
Watch this.

2414
02:19:42,530 --> 02:19:43,550
Watch this.

2415
02:19:44,050 --> 02:19:45,390
Watch this.

2416
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:47,650
Wait, why is she still out her butt for me.

2417
02:19:48,290 --> 02:19:48,810
Watch this.

2418
02:19:49,350 --> 02:19:49,890
Watch this.

2419
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:54,290
Watch this.

2420
02:19:54,610 --> 02:19:54,970
Watch this.

2421
02:19:56,410 --> 02:19:59,030
watch this.

2422
02:19:59,210 --> 02:20:01,330
Turn around.

2423
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:01,550
Turn.

2424
02:20:01,710 --> 02:20:02,770
Okay, watch this.

2425
02:20:05,810 --> 02:20:07,810
It wasn't a fluke.

2426
02:20:08,330 --> 02:20:08,930
I promise.

2427
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:12,630
It wasn't a fluke.

2428
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:13,270
I promise.

2429
02:20:16,050 --> 02:20:17,050
Let this go.

2430
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:20,210
I just have to go find another lady.

2431
02:20:24,380 --> 02:20:24,740
You know what?

2432
02:20:24,800 --> 02:20:25,800
I'm done with ladies.

2433
02:20:27,980 --> 02:20:29,560
I don't need a relationship.

2434
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:31,960
I'm a strong, independent Indiana Jones.

2435
02:20:35,280 --> 02:20:36,920
She's just in it for the whip.

2436
02:20:38,100 --> 02:20:40,920
Me when I'm trying to show off her cute girl.

2437
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:44,340
Watch this.

2438
02:20:45,320 --> 02:20:45,980
Watch this.

2439
02:20:47,440 --> 02:20:48,760
Hoping for spooky games this month.

2440
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:49,680
Any chance of death strand?

2441
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:51,460
Death Stranding this month?

2442
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:52,720
Maybe.

2443
02:20:55,600 --> 02:20:57,440
Oh my gosh, it's the end.

2444
02:20:58,860 --> 02:20:59,920
We're such a...

2445
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:01,120
We're such an amateur.

2446
02:21:04,320 --> 02:21:06,840
Oh my, this guy is just in a full tank.

2447
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,460
All the people, am I right?

2448
02:21:20,450 --> 02:21:22,890
I'm throwing them, I'm literally throwing them.

2449
02:21:24,010 --> 02:21:25,190
Tossing them around.

2450
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:32,760
Hey, hey, I have a gun too.

2451
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:34,800
Oh, I died.

2452
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:36,080
So now.

2453
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:37,740
Wait.

2454
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:39,480
What happened to my gun?

2455
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:41,740
I have one, and then I think I dropped it.

2456
02:21:43,860 --> 02:21:44,380
Um.

2457
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:48,880
One second, we're exploring a little bit.

2458
02:21:51,180 --> 02:21:52,020
I'm getting money.

2459
02:21:52,640 --> 02:21:54,640
There's lots of things to explode in here.

2460
02:21:54,860 --> 02:21:55,560
Can I...

2461
02:21:56,540 --> 02:21:57,060
Yeah.

2462
02:21:57,940 --> 02:21:58,400
Oh!

2463
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:05,980
Whoa, whoa, what is going on in here?

2464
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,580
This goes to what?

2465
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:13,860
This goes to here?

2466
02:22:14,420 --> 02:22:15,420
I'm a strong independent.

2467
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:20,220
I don't have one of those, though.

2468
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:23,780
Oh, okay, we're just gonna...

2469
02:22:25,980 --> 02:22:27,680
Okay, thanks, Gabe.

2470
02:22:29,720 --> 02:22:31,280
Oh, that's me shooting my gun.

2471
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:31,860
Oh my gosh.

2472
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:35,820
I don't think I can go up there, unfortunately.

2473
02:22:36,580 --> 02:22:37,780
There's even more, though.

2474
02:22:37,980 --> 02:22:38,880
I want to go up.

2475
02:22:48,880 --> 02:22:51,700
Oh, I didn't realize that was a ledge.

2476
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:53,700
Ouch.

2477
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:02,220
Oops, sorry.

2478
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,840
Sorry, Sala.

2479
02:23:03,360 --> 02:23:04,060
Sorry, so sorry.

2480
02:23:04,500 --> 02:23:05,680
Oh, these are our friends.

2481
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:07,860
These guys are on our side.

2482
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:10,820
Except why are you aiming that at me, huh?

2483
02:23:11,100 --> 02:23:12,360
I'm not going to attack you.

2484
02:23:20,430 --> 02:23:21,590
Build, build, build.

2485
02:23:24,410 --> 02:23:27,870
Oh, wait, I don't have my Papa to read for me.

2486
02:23:28,890 --> 02:23:29,810
I'm illiterate.

2487
02:23:32,250 --> 02:23:35,010
Even though I'm a professor of this stuff, allegedly.

2488
02:23:36,470 --> 02:23:37,850
Indy, I need to see your license.

2489
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:41,490
He's just showing you his cool gun.

2490
02:23:42,130 --> 02:23:43,210
Right, right, right, right, right.

2491
02:23:44,250 --> 02:23:44,690
Actually.

2492
02:23:46,430 --> 02:23:46,950
Oh!

2493
02:23:50,320 --> 02:23:51,360
What is it making?

2494
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:58,540
Oh, I think I lost my gun.

2495
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:01,020
Oh, but this is another thing I need to blow up.

2496
02:24:01,580 --> 02:24:02,060
Hmm.

2497
02:24:03,600 --> 02:24:04,080
Hmm.

2498
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:08,160
I don't have a rocket launcher, unfortunately.

2499
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:10,420
Is there one in here?

2500
02:24:15,540 --> 02:24:18,200
He's a professor of archaeology, not languages.

2501
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:21,700
Well, he studied the wrong field, done.

2502
02:24:24,100 --> 02:24:24,580
Obviously.

2503
02:24:25,360 --> 02:24:25,560
Obviously.

2504
02:24:27,460 --> 02:24:29,100
I need to see his license.

2505
02:24:29,480 --> 02:24:30,000
Oh, sorry.

2506
02:24:34,860 --> 02:24:35,940
What are we creating?

2507
02:24:36,780 --> 02:24:37,200
Ah.

2508
02:24:45,220 --> 02:24:46,160
What's this go-to?

2509
02:24:49,820 --> 02:24:50,220
Okay.

2510
02:24:51,180 --> 02:24:51,620
Interesting.

2511
02:24:54,460 --> 02:24:54,720
Okay.

2512
02:24:55,340 --> 02:24:56,980
Come on, come on, come on.

2513
02:24:57,140 --> 02:24:57,560
Oh, to here.

2514
02:24:57,700 --> 02:24:58,440
Oh, I need three of them.

2515
02:24:58,920 --> 02:24:59,100
Okay.

2516
02:25:00,200 --> 02:25:02,460
So, do I blow...

2517
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:02,620
What?

2518
02:25:03,360 --> 02:25:04,760
I get this actually now, I think about it.

2519
02:25:05,560 --> 02:25:06,160
Was it from here?

2520
02:25:07,660 --> 02:25:08,700
Was it from you?

2521
02:25:09,380 --> 02:25:09,440
Oh!

2522
02:25:10,940 --> 02:25:11,680
Was it from you?

2523
02:25:12,500 --> 02:25:12,680
Yeah.

2524
02:25:14,180 --> 02:25:16,600
Was it you?

2525
02:25:18,620 --> 02:25:20,100
I think it was the trucks, no?

2526
02:25:31,490 --> 02:25:32,430
Oh, sorry.

2527
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:38,590
It's the trucks, but maybe not all of them have it.

2528
02:25:39,830 --> 02:25:41,150
Do you have one?

2529
02:25:43,930 --> 02:25:46,050
No, I think because it's already on fire.

2530
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:47,910
Let's try another.

2531
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:50,670
Excuse me.

2532
02:25:52,530 --> 02:25:53,570
The boss is horse.

2533
02:25:56,090 --> 02:25:57,450
Why is there a horse here?

2534
02:25:58,850 --> 02:26:00,370
Oh, there's also one up there.

2535
02:26:01,950 --> 02:26:02,510
Interesting.

2536
02:26:04,070 --> 02:26:04,950
Don't mind me.

2537
02:26:05,490 --> 02:26:06,910
Horse, watch your legs.

2538
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:09,990
Umma, umma.

2539
02:26:10,150 --> 02:26:12,330
How do I get up there?

2540
02:26:16,540 --> 02:26:16,780
Woo!

2541
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:18,720
Okay.

2542
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:23,540
Kick me!

2543
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:26,520
Oh wait, he likes me now.

2544
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:27,700
Uh...

2545
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:29,880
There we go.

2546
02:26:30,100 --> 02:26:30,400
Awesome.

2547
02:26:31,640 --> 02:26:32,200
Alrighty!

2548
02:26:36,200 --> 02:26:38,080
Nice to first try.

2549
02:26:39,500 --> 02:26:40,340
Excuse me!

2550
02:26:40,680 --> 02:26:41,900
Excuse me.

2551
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:42,640
Gosh.

2552
02:26:43,800 --> 02:26:45,120
Very important.

2553
02:26:46,100 --> 02:26:48,720
archaeological work here in the works.

2554
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:53,060
Wait, but how do I get the third one?

2555
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:00,530
The third one is a real mystery here.

2556
02:27:02,970 --> 02:27:07,450
And your wimpy jumps are not making me feel good.

2557
02:27:09,170 --> 02:27:09,930
Sala has a shovel.

2558
02:27:10,410 --> 02:27:11,030
Does he?

2559
02:27:11,250 --> 02:27:11,550
Oh!

2560
02:27:12,750 --> 02:27:13,430
You're right.

2561
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:15,410
Uh, it was in here, right?

2562
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:20,130
Aha!

2563
02:27:20,890 --> 02:27:21,610
Oh, thank you.

2564
02:27:21,710 --> 02:27:22,690
I had no idea.

2565
02:27:23,830 --> 02:27:25,010
Thank you so much.

2566
02:27:26,910 --> 02:27:28,150
Alright, come back down!

2567
02:27:36,010 --> 02:27:37,730
That's a lot of stuff, I know you're in.

2568
02:27:39,390 --> 02:27:39,750
Okay.

2569
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:41,970
Really?

2570
02:27:41,970 --> 02:27:42,490
Fine.

2571
02:27:43,850 --> 02:27:44,770
What's in here?

2572
02:27:46,250 --> 02:27:47,530
Ah, there it is!

2573
02:27:47,910 --> 02:27:48,430
But...

2574
02:27:48,430 --> 02:27:49,530
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

2575
02:27:50,510 --> 02:27:51,550
Not quite.

2576
02:27:57,370 --> 02:27:58,790
Oh, there's nothing.

2577
02:27:59,110 --> 02:28:00,130
Oh, okay.

2578
02:28:01,050 --> 02:28:01,070
Dang.

2579
02:28:07,110 --> 02:28:09,170
Oh, we're up here.

2580
02:28:11,610 --> 02:28:13,010
Oh, whoa.

2581
02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:18,310

2582
02:28:23,130 --> 02:28:25,030
Oh, he's hard at work.

2583
02:28:25,810 --> 02:28:26,990

2585
02:28:34,630 --> 02:28:37,810

2586
02:28:43,010 --> 02:28:43,350
Yes?

2587
02:28:46,270 --> 02:28:47,230
Oh,

2588
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:52,130

2589
02:28:53,470 --> 02:28:54,350
Shagohad.

2590
02:28:54,910 --> 02:28:55,150
Wait.

2591
02:28:56,810 --> 02:28:59,070
This is really just a Metal Gear haul.

2592
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:02,150
Oh.

2593
02:29:05,150 --> 02:29:20,030

2595
02:29:35,120 --> 02:29:35,900

2596
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:47,580
Oh, that was close.

2597
02:29:48,400 --> 02:29:48,860
Wait, what is this?

2598
02:29:48,940 --> 02:29:49,460
Is this a mine?

2599
02:29:52,060 --> 02:29:53,120
Oh, it is!

2600
02:29:53,320 --> 02:29:53,720
But...

2601
02:29:53,720 --> 02:29:54,640
Oh, it did do damage.

2602
02:29:55,140 --> 02:29:55,920
That's huge.

2603
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:56,560
That's huge.

2604
02:29:57,380 --> 02:29:59,100
We're growing more flowers again.

2605
02:29:59,260 --> 02:30:01,280
What is... What is... What is this?

2606
02:30:09,410 --> 02:30:10,910
Ah, so sad.

2607
02:30:11,770 --> 02:30:12,490
Wait, here, too?

2608
02:30:14,490 --> 02:30:15,630
Send it here?

2609
02:30:17,390 --> 02:30:17,870
Yeah.

2610
02:30:18,210 --> 02:30:18,450
Shoot.

2611
02:30:18,810 --> 02:30:19,370
Like shoot.

2612
02:30:20,210 --> 02:30:21,950
Like, I'm right here and then you shoot me.

2613
02:30:22,510 --> 02:30:22,670
You know?

2614
02:30:24,270 --> 02:30:24,750
Like...

2615
02:30:24,750 --> 02:30:25,270
Dang it!

2616
02:30:25,350 --> 02:30:26,110
You miss!

2617
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:27,230
How could you miss?

2618
02:30:27,930 --> 02:30:30,670
Okay, like, right here.

2619
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:35,290
Can flowers bloom on the battle?

2620
02:30:36,550 --> 02:30:37,030
Field.

2621
02:30:39,310 --> 02:30:40,550
Maybe I jump on top.

2622
02:30:48,270 --> 02:30:48,650
Hello?

2623
02:30:51,410 --> 02:30:52,270
I'm right here.

2624
02:30:52,430 --> 02:30:52,810
Okay, cool.

2625
02:30:52,810 --> 02:30:53,550
Oop!

2626
02:30:54,810 --> 02:30:55,650
Okay, too high.

2627
02:30:58,490 --> 02:30:59,010
Ah!

2628
02:30:59,510 --> 02:31:00,850
Okay, it was worth blowing up for.

2629
02:31:02,030 --> 02:31:04,350
Some people are worth blowing up for.

2630
02:31:12,860 --> 02:31:13,720
Okay, nice.

2631
02:31:19,180 --> 02:31:19,660
Did it work?

2632
02:31:19,780 --> 02:31:20,520
Oh, it works!

2633
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:20,880
Nice!

2634
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:22,160
It worked, it worked.

2635
02:31:25,880 --> 02:31:27,260
Okay, I'm right here!

2636
02:31:28,720 --> 02:31:29,080
Okay.

2637
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:34,340
Too high!

2638
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:35,200
Whoa!

2639
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:36,900
Nice!

2640
02:31:37,680 --> 02:31:38,160
Right here!

2641
02:31:38,260 --> 02:31:38,720
Right here!

2642
02:31:39,540 --> 02:31:39,980
Right here!

2643
02:31:40,220 --> 02:31:40,460
Right here!

2644
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:42,700
Too high!

2645
02:31:43,740 --> 02:31:45,000
I am a little lower.

2646
02:31:45,120 --> 02:31:46,320
Lower your expectations.

2647
02:31:51,140 --> 02:31:55,180
I didn't die though.

2648
02:31:57,100 --> 02:31:58,060
Oh, start building.

2649
02:32:07,590 --> 02:32:08,830
Sola again.

2650
02:32:10,910 --> 02:32:11,730
Oh wait!

2651
02:32:11,730 --> 02:32:14,330
Now we can kind of, like, look at this area.

2652
02:32:14,670 --> 02:32:16,190
Oh, I wanted to get that blue one.

2653
02:32:18,030 --> 02:32:19,410
But he can dig this.

2654
02:32:19,470 --> 02:32:19,890
Let's see.

2655
02:32:22,650 --> 02:32:23,390
Whatever's here.

2656
02:32:23,990 --> 02:32:24,230
Whoa.

2657
02:32:24,590 --> 02:32:25,070
What is this?

2658
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:26,810
What is this?

2659
02:32:28,650 --> 02:32:29,530
Actually, what is this?

2660
02:32:34,490 --> 02:32:37,910
It requires some sort of power-up that I do not have.

2661
02:32:38,890 --> 02:32:39,670
It's a mailbox.

2662
02:32:48,520 --> 02:32:49,540
I guess we can...

2663
02:32:49,560 --> 02:32:51,560
I still have more stuff with Mr...

2664
02:32:53,740 --> 02:32:54,540
Oh no!

2665
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:57,200
Wait, I wonder what I would...

2666
02:32:57,200 --> 02:32:59,720
He like blows something up up here and then I...

2667
02:33:01,120 --> 02:33:01,520
Ah!

2668
02:33:02,160 --> 02:33:03,300
I've rolled the cart.

2669
02:33:03,460 --> 02:33:04,380
Wait, that's kind of fun.

2670
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:08,600
Wait, I think we can do it ourselves!

2671
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:10,660
Just kidding.

2672
02:33:15,160 --> 02:33:16,640
Yeah, we can do it ourselves.

2673
02:33:17,080 --> 02:33:17,840
Move out of the way.

2674
02:33:24,690 --> 02:33:24,970
YAHOO!

2675
02:33:35,720 --> 02:33:38,280
We'll grab this and then we'll keep going.

2676
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:40,680
Cinematic camera.

2677
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:42,320
I know it's so cool.

2678
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:44,220
Alright, let's go.

2679
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:49,040
That was fast.

2680
02:33:50,760 --> 02:33:51,600
Right here, right here!

2681
02:33:53,780 --> 02:33:54,340
Holy!

2682
02:33:54,760 --> 02:33:55,400
Oh my gosh.

2683
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:04,600

2684
02:34:11,180 --> 02:34:16,420

2685
02:34:21,340 --> 02:34:25,040

2686
02:34:29,130 --> 02:34:41,710
okay i think the horse i don't think you can get the horse can you it wouldn't do that would they Oh wow, this is for a secret I thought it was for.

2687
02:34:43,650 --> 02:34:44,690
Okay, just kidding.

2688
02:34:45,270 --> 02:34:49,370
Definitely thought it was for the battle that we're currently going through at the moment.

2689
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:51,410
No worries, though.

2690
02:34:54,670 --> 02:34:58,010
I would love to not be by this plan.

2691
02:34:58,210 --> 02:34:58,570
Thank you.

2692
02:35:06,900 --> 02:35:10,140
This game is just so unnecessarily violent sometimes.

2693
02:35:12,980 --> 02:35:16,900
I feel like...

2694
02:35:16,920 --> 02:35:17,540
something else?

2695
02:35:18,320 --> 02:35:19,480
There's that, obviously.

2696
02:35:21,680 --> 02:35:22,920
Alright, come on, horse, let's go!

2697
02:35:24,660 --> 02:35:27,080
They're not as fast as I thought they'd be.

2698
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:31,840
They're definitely, like, running in slow motion kind of horses.

2699
02:35:50,530 --> 02:35:53,110
They're like, we're gonna kick your butt.

2700
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:54,790
Oh, no, one of these again.

2701
02:35:57,190 --> 02:35:57,350
Oh.

2702
02:35:57,690 --> 02:35:58,410
They didn't even...

2703
02:35:59,670 --> 02:36:00,010
Okay.

2704
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:03,950
Okay.

2705
02:36:04,470 --> 02:36:05,450
I think they tripped.

2706
02:36:08,260 --> 02:36:11,580
I think they both tripped, like, trying to get on the...

2707
02:36:11,580 --> 02:36:12,640
on the bus.

2708
02:36:13,540 --> 02:36:14,160
That's fine.

2709
02:36:15,100 --> 02:36:15,580
Oh, Sala!

2710
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:16,980
Sala, are you okay?

2711
02:36:22,150 --> 02:36:23,050
Oh, B2!

2712
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:24,130
I also tripped!

2713
02:36:25,810 --> 02:36:26,010
Oh!

2714
02:36:30,650 --> 02:36:32,210
Yeah, they're fumbling hard.

2715
02:36:33,690 --> 02:36:36,190
Okay, Sala, this is, like, your chance to...

2716
02:36:36,210 --> 02:36:36,550
Okay.

2717
02:36:37,890 --> 02:36:40,070
You could have done anything except look at your hat.

2718
02:36:40,830 --> 02:36:42,690
You could have done literally anything.

2719
02:36:44,070 --> 02:36:45,590
And you chose to look at your hat.

2720
02:36:46,070 --> 02:36:46,650
That's fine.

2721
02:36:47,410 --> 02:36:50,950
Oh, that guy jumped over and then noked it.

2722
02:36:52,350 --> 02:36:53,310
It was...

2723
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:55,450
It's fine.

2724
02:36:58,930 --> 02:36:59,950
It's a good hat.

2725
02:37:00,170 --> 02:37:01,490
I mean, I'm not denying that.

2726
02:37:02,150 --> 02:37:02,730
And I'm...

2727
02:37:02,730 --> 02:37:04,270
I appreciate a good hat.

2728
02:37:04,770 --> 02:37:06,190
Oh, that was smooth, Indy.

2729
02:37:08,510 --> 02:37:09,350
Come on, Zala!

2730
02:37:09,950 --> 02:37:10,410
Come on!

2731
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:22,770
Wow, there's so many guys.

2732
02:37:25,630 --> 02:37:28,530
I like that I can just punch them off though.

2733
02:37:32,490 --> 02:37:32,970
Game over!

2734
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:34,050
Not for me!

2735
02:37:36,230 --> 02:37:36,710
Yeah!

2736
02:37:40,550 --> 02:37:41,890
Definitely for him!

2737
02:37:42,650 --> 02:37:43,130
Oh,

2738
02:37:46,270 --> 02:37:49,310
I remember this part too, and they were like, Oh my gosh, Indy's dead!

2739
02:37:49,570 --> 02:37:50,110
Indy's dead!

2740
02:37:59,140 --> 02:38:00,940
What are we sad about?

2741
02:38:02,460 --> 02:38:03,200
Oh, my buddy.

2742
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:05,020
Oh, it looked like he smooched him.

2743
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,120
Move far, say him.

2744
02:38:11,980 --> 02:38:15,160
So the next one should be the last one, right?

2745
02:38:21,700 --> 02:38:23,740
Ah, I wasn't a true adventurer.

2746
02:38:30,580 --> 02:38:31,680
Oh, sorry, I forgot.

2747
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:34,220
I have a lot.

2748
02:38:34,400 --> 02:38:38,520
Let's go try and buy another sexy lady and then I'll...

2749
02:38:40,160 --> 02:38:40,740
Then...

2750
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:42,560
That'll be it.

2751
02:38:44,400 --> 02:38:45,360
Then we'll play.

2752
02:38:45,560 --> 02:38:46,820
I just want to buy a sexy lady.

2753
02:38:47,560 --> 02:38:48,840
It's my final chance!

2754
02:38:51,020 --> 02:38:52,180
Enemy butler.

2755
02:38:52,340 --> 02:38:53,740
Wait, where's enemy made?

2756
02:39:07,900 --> 02:39:08,840
Go, go!

2757
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:16,760
Congrats, Mint, you destroyed the Shagohad once again.

2758
02:39:16,940 --> 02:39:18,080
I really felt like it.

2759
02:39:19,680 --> 02:39:21,240
Elsa in the desert.

2760
02:39:32,520 --> 02:39:33,580
What's Kazim?

2761
02:39:35,900 --> 02:39:37,420
Oh, is that God?

2762
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:41,480
I forgot that this was like a subplot of this movie.

2763
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:51,320
That there's like people that are actually like, Hi, we, um, we're, we're protecting the, the, the, we're protecting the Holy Grail.

2764
02:39:53,700 --> 02:39:56,420
I completely forgot these guys were in the movie.

2765
02:40:01,360 --> 02:40:02,900
They don't do anything.

2766
02:40:05,100 --> 02:40:07,020
They really don't do much.

2767
02:40:08,700 --> 02:40:15,180
In fact, even in this game, I'm, you're kind of just like, you're kind of just like, what are you?

2768
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:18,260
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, hold on, hold on, hold on.

2769
02:40:19,860 --> 02:40:20,720
watch this

2770
02:40:23,740 --> 02:40:48,280

2771
02:40:52,970 --> 02:40:53,530
You're watching?

2772
02:40:53,750 --> 02:40:54,130
You're watching?

2773
02:40:54,270 --> 02:40:54,750
Yeah, good, good.

2774
02:40:55,350 --> 02:40:55,930
Oh, what's this?

2775
02:40:56,870 --> 02:40:57,630
I thought...

2776
02:40:57,630 --> 02:41:00,690
Oh my gosh, I thought this guy right here was Elmo.

2777
02:41:13,640 --> 02:41:14,880
You guys see it too?

2778
02:41:14,960 --> 02:41:16,080
It looks like Elmo, no?

2779
02:41:19,020 --> 02:41:20,700
Okay, this is the last one!

2780
02:41:20,880 --> 02:41:21,680
How exciting!

2781
02:41:26,540 --> 02:41:30,880
Like, from a glance, when he walked by, I was like, that's Elmo in my game.

2782
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:34,080
Okay.

2783
02:41:35,320 --> 02:41:39,620
I don't think I've completed literally a single one of these, but that's fine.

2784
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:44,560
Minto buying and then whipping girls?

2785
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:50,340
It's one of my hobbies.

2786
02:41:54,360 --> 02:41:56,220
Can't unsee that Elmo ticked away.

2787
02:41:58,560 --> 02:42:00,100
What are they doing?

2788
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:00,400
Oh.

2789
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:04,320
Why do you sound French?

2790
02:42:07,160 --> 02:42:07,660
Oh.

2791
02:42:09,560 --> 02:42:09,960
Hello.

2792
02:42:14,570 --> 02:42:15,830
We're all just chilling here.

2793
02:42:16,190 --> 02:42:17,130
Indy's behind my head.

2794
02:42:17,250 --> 02:42:17,670
I'm so sorry.

2795
02:42:17,810 --> 02:42:18,550
You can't see him.

2796
02:42:24,130 --> 02:42:24,530
Nice.

2797
02:42:24,630 --> 02:42:25,830
That was pretty smooth, I'd say.

2798
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:28,050
Oh, wow.

2799
02:42:29,790 --> 02:42:30,710
They don't stop coming.

2800
02:42:30,790 --> 02:42:31,650
They don't stop coming.

2801
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:35,250
Turning it down a little, sorry.

2802
02:42:42,120 --> 02:42:43,120
That's everybody, right?

2803
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:45,560
They won't be joining us again.

2804
02:42:47,080 --> 02:42:48,360
Seems to be the case.

2805
02:42:49,160 --> 02:42:49,880
Very nice.

2806
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:52,400
Look, we have, like, a full party now.

2807
02:42:52,500 --> 02:42:53,620
Indy, why'd you jump in there?

2808
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:02,460
Okay.

2809
02:43:05,020 --> 02:43:06,180
What is this thing?

2810
02:43:06,800 --> 02:43:06,960
Wait.

2811
02:43:09,080 --> 02:43:10,040
Everybody's in there.

2812
02:43:11,320 --> 02:43:11,800
Everybody's...

2813
02:43:11,800 --> 02:43:11,920
Okay.

2814
02:43:12,140 --> 02:43:15,040
Everybody has decided to go in there for some reason.

2815
02:43:20,220 --> 02:43:23,260
I want to be Indiana Jones, I want to be the main character.

2816
02:43:26,520 --> 02:43:28,760
It's a petting zoo or something.

2817
02:43:34,240 --> 02:43:36,420
Gosh, this game makes me so sick.

2818
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:38,460
Oh, I'm shooting the gun.

2819
02:43:38,640 --> 02:43:39,220
I didn't mean to.

2820
02:43:43,070 --> 02:43:46,050
It's okay, we're on the last... last one.

2821
02:43:49,610 --> 02:43:51,170
I don't know what it is about this game.

2822
02:43:51,190 --> 02:43:51,990
him.

2823
02:43:55,030 --> 02:43:55,430
Hoi!

2824
02:43:58,460 --> 02:43:58,900
Close.

2825
02:43:59,640 --> 02:43:59,640
Hoi!

2826
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:01,620
Hoi!

2827
02:44:02,200 --> 02:44:02,840
Oh, come on.

2828
02:44:02,960 --> 02:44:04,320
I'm literally touching that.

2829
02:44:07,140 --> 02:44:08,480
You think it's the camera motion?

2830
02:44:08,680 --> 02:44:09,780
I don't know what it is.

2831
02:44:10,140 --> 02:44:13,860
I'm usually not so bad with like, uh, like getting motion sick in games.

2832
02:44:19,220 --> 02:44:20,160
Ah, there we go.

2833
02:44:21,600 --> 02:44:25,420
If there was a way to turn a change frame rate though, I would, Unfortunately.

2834
02:44:26,360 --> 02:44:27,580
There is not.

2835
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:29,340
Unfortunately.

2836
02:44:35,760 --> 02:44:38,140
This game has very minimal.

2837
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:48,360
It's okay though.

2838
02:44:49,300 --> 02:44:50,220
I'm still having fun.

2839
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:52,820
But it's just like.

2840
02:44:54,340 --> 02:44:56,000
I just need like a...

2841
02:44:56,740 --> 02:44:59,080
I did, like, close my eyes for a bit, you know?

2842
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:02,980
Get in there.

2843
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:07,340
Okay.

2844
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:11,640
Right, left, up, right.

2845
02:45:16,780 --> 02:45:17,480
Drink water.

2846
02:45:17,640 --> 02:45:18,540
I am, I am.

2847
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:19,120
No worries.

2848
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:24,220
I've been drinking water the whole time.

2849
02:45:25,420 --> 02:45:26,220
Thank you, though.

2850
02:45:28,160 --> 02:45:28,520
Oh, yeah.

2851
02:45:30,980 --> 02:45:32,520
Me and Sala, the dream team.

2852
02:45:32,540 --> 02:45:34,360
Ow, I bit my tongue.

2853
02:45:37,940 --> 02:45:39,540
The dream to live.

2854
02:45:42,900 --> 02:45:43,180
Dude.

2855
02:45:45,280 --> 02:45:46,720
Destroy priceless artifacts.

2856
02:45:48,180 --> 02:45:48,780
What is this thing?

2857
02:45:55,400 --> 02:45:58,960
I'm so sorry I missed what your super chat said, but thank you so much for the super chat.

2858
02:45:59,740 --> 02:46:00,900
Thank you, thank you.

2859
02:46:04,030 --> 02:46:06,850
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2860
02:46:06,850 --> 02:46:08,150
Okay, what do I do with this thing?

2861
02:46:14,220 --> 02:46:17,500
Up and down motions, tracking, jumping.

2862
02:46:23,280 --> 02:46:24,120
It's fine.

2863
02:46:24,300 --> 02:46:33,460
Like I said, I was talking to a friend too, and they were like, I tried watching your Indiana Jones Lego playthrough, and I couldn't do it because the game made me so sick.

2864
02:46:35,040 --> 02:46:37,060
I was like, yeah, me too.

2865
02:46:38,980 --> 02:46:39,420
Sucks.

2866
02:46:40,340 --> 02:46:41,460
Do I have to...

2867
02:46:41,460 --> 02:46:42,680
Oh, I think we have to light this up.

2868
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:44,800
on fire, so let's go grab the torch.

2869
02:46:46,380 --> 02:46:51,400
And then we can probably... For some reason we need to be directed to be able to read.

2870
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:53,700
Oh, it's probably too dark!

2871
02:46:55,300 --> 02:46:56,000
Break time?

2872
02:46:56,080 --> 02:46:56,660
No, it's okay.

2873
02:46:56,760 --> 02:46:58,740
We're on the last chapter anyway.

2874
02:46:58,880 --> 02:46:59,140
It's okay.

2875
02:47:02,700 --> 02:47:03,140
Uh...

2876
02:47:03,620 --> 02:47:04,640
Was that right?

2877
02:47:07,020 --> 02:47:07,800
Heck yeah!

2878
02:47:11,330 --> 02:47:14,270
Sorry if watching it makes you feel a little biticky.

2879
02:47:15,550 --> 02:47:17,150
Just know you're not alone.

2880
02:47:19,410 --> 02:47:21,390
Misery, something, something, misery, company.

2881
02:47:22,570 --> 02:47:23,630
What is he like again?

2882
02:47:23,770 --> 02:47:25,090
Like, cool guys?

2883
02:47:26,210 --> 02:47:26,730
Or...

2884
02:47:26,730 --> 02:47:28,610
Aw, he's like, you're a grandpa.

2885
02:47:30,050 --> 02:47:30,550
Aw, man.

2886
02:47:30,610 --> 02:47:32,050
Sean Connery is cool.

2887
02:47:32,950 --> 02:47:33,970
He's a big boss.

2888
02:47:36,030 --> 02:47:36,670
You feel okay?

2889
02:47:36,790 --> 02:47:37,210
That's good.

2890
02:47:40,670 --> 02:47:42,430
Misery loves company.

2891
02:47:49,800 --> 02:47:50,060
Okay.

2892
02:47:50,420 --> 02:47:50,960
Nice!

2893
02:47:51,560 --> 02:47:52,380
Good hop!

2894
02:47:53,940 --> 02:47:55,960
And then the red one.

2895
02:47:58,900 --> 02:48:00,340
Minkiana is Toad's Worth.

2896
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:02,920
I didn't expect it from the game, to be honest.

2897
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:04,440
To feel this way.

2898
02:48:04,860 --> 02:48:09,940
But literally every stream of this of this playthrough has been like this.

2899
02:48:15,390 --> 02:48:15,650
Ah!

2900
02:48:15,910 --> 02:48:16,090
Oh!

2901
02:48:25,870 --> 02:48:26,890
Where's the grail?

2902
02:48:27,010 --> 02:48:27,250
Oh!

2903
02:48:28,510 --> 02:48:29,070
Yeah.

2904
02:48:29,330 --> 02:48:30,470
Oh, uh-uh.

2905
02:48:30,470 --> 02:48:32,190
Oh, wait, do we get to pick the Grail?

2906
02:48:32,290 --> 02:48:33,230
That'd be so exciting.

2907
02:48:35,310 --> 02:48:35,790
Oh!

2908
02:48:36,290 --> 02:48:37,190
Oh my god!

2909
02:48:37,390 --> 02:48:38,610
This is- oh my god!

2910
02:48:48,250 --> 02:48:49,090
Oh my god!

2911
02:48:49,250 --> 02:48:50,030
Oh my god!

2912
02:48:50,170 --> 02:48:50,430
Wait!

2913
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:54,690
There's a decapitated man and then they amputated my father?

2914
02:48:54,970 --> 02:48:57,250
This is so messed up!

2915
02:49:00,450 --> 02:49:05,110
And we're just gonna- We're just gonna be okay with that and continue our adventure.

2916
02:49:05,290 --> 02:49:05,810
Got it.

2917
02:49:07,030 --> 02:49:08,250
Wait, when did Indy get the book?

2918
02:49:19,480 --> 02:49:19,880
Oh.

2919
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:23,320
How do I turn it off?

2920
02:49:23,520 --> 02:49:23,740
Wait.

2921
02:49:26,300 --> 02:49:26,980
Oh, wait.

2922
02:49:27,140 --> 02:49:27,640
I messed up.

2923
02:49:28,380 --> 02:49:28,640
Ow!

2924
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:30,780
Uh-oh.

2925
02:49:31,400 --> 02:49:32,740
Okay, how do I turn it off?

2926
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:33,800
Oh, well, shoot.

2927
02:49:34,660 --> 02:49:35,640
Oh my god, wait.

2928
02:49:43,970 --> 02:49:44,930
I want that.

2929
02:49:45,010 --> 02:49:46,810
That's, like, the ration to me right now.

2930
02:49:47,110 --> 02:49:48,270
Like, the Metal Gear ration.

2931
02:49:49,550 --> 02:49:49,950
Okay.

2932
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:52,830
I won't do it though.

2933
02:49:53,810 --> 02:49:54,990
I know better.

2934
02:49:57,070 --> 02:49:58,590
Oh, we need a tiny...

2935
02:49:58,590 --> 02:50:00,150
We need a kid or a monkey.

2936
02:50:09,560 --> 02:50:10,800
Oh, I could get this easy.

2937
02:50:11,140 --> 02:50:11,220
Oh.

2938
02:50:15,750 --> 02:50:18,470
This... I think this game is screwing with me a little bit.

2939
02:50:27,910 --> 02:50:29,430
I don't know if it's possible.

You and us.

Nice, nice.

2950
02:51:32,620 --> 02:51:33,480
Is that a hole?

2951
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:34,220
I think so.

2952
02:51:35,200 --> 02:51:35,280
Okay.

2953
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:42,500
He just really wanted to get so close.

2954
02:51:49,900 --> 02:51:52,520
I don't know what that's for, but we'll take it.

2955
02:51:52,800 --> 02:51:53,340
Oh, not yet.

2956
02:51:53,560 --> 02:51:53,820
Not yet.

2957
02:51:53,940 --> 02:51:54,140
Not yet.

2958
02:51:54,480 --> 02:51:55,960
Grab the loot first.

2959
02:51:56,760 --> 02:51:57,400
What are you doing?

2960
02:51:57,840 --> 02:51:58,560
Are you an amateur?

2961
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:11,130
He wanted to experience the pain together.

2962
02:52:12,150 --> 02:52:13,430
It's quite romantic.

2963
02:52:21,740 --> 02:52:23,220
There's a piece over there.

2964
02:52:24,540 --> 02:52:25,960
And there's money here.

2965
02:52:27,440 --> 02:52:29,060
If I could jump behind there.

2966
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:31,020
Again.

2967
02:52:31,720 --> 02:52:32,800
Whoa, sick tricks.

2968
02:52:37,150 --> 02:52:39,030
Oh, I think I need to make this move.

2969
02:52:39,330 --> 02:52:39,390
Okay.

2970
02:52:45,480 --> 02:52:45,780
Wait.

2971
02:52:49,380 --> 02:52:49,900
Or...

2972
02:52:49,900 --> 02:52:51,240
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2973
02:52:51,640 --> 02:52:51,880
Wait.

2974
02:52:54,620 --> 02:52:55,080
Oh wait.

2975
02:52:56,400 --> 02:52:58,080
Not ha ha ha ha ha.

2976
02:52:58,260 --> 02:52:58,740
Indy!

2977
02:52:59,160 --> 02:52:59,400
What?

2978
02:52:59,500 --> 02:53:00,460
What are you doing over there?

2979
02:53:01,080 --> 02:53:01,600
Oh wait.

2980
02:53:02,560 --> 02:53:04,300
Can you make that jump with us?

2981
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:06,660
I can't make that jump by myself.

2982
02:53:08,340 --> 02:53:09,060
Okay, just kidding.

2983
02:53:09,160 --> 02:53:09,900
I don't think we can.

2984
02:53:12,460 --> 02:53:12,940
Wait.

2985
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:15,120
How do I do?

2986
02:53:22,240 --> 02:53:23,480
How do I do?

2987
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:28,220
I can't push this.

2988
02:53:34,420 --> 02:53:35,780
Can you whip it?

2989
02:53:36,380 --> 02:53:37,280
Whip it good?

2990
02:53:38,460 --> 02:53:38,620
No.

2991
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:45,640
I didn't see anything else.

2992
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:59,260
I think I might have to try and jump with this or something.

2993
02:54:01,320 --> 02:54:03,360
I don't know how else to do it.

2994
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:10,400
It's time for me to go to work later, Mito.

2995
02:54:10,580 --> 02:54:11,840
How a good day of work!

2996
02:54:12,140 --> 02:54:13,560
Thanks for sticking around!

2997
02:54:15,520 --> 02:54:15,760
Oh,

2998
02:54:29,220 --> 02:54:30,140
wait, I put it here.

2999
02:54:31,500 --> 02:54:31,760
Okay.

3000
02:54:37,240 --> 02:54:39,140
Not close enough, maybe, to the edge.

3001
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:40,420
Okay, hold on.

3002
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:43,020
Okay.

3003
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:43,920
Ha!

3004
02:54:45,160 --> 02:54:45,600
Ha!

3005
02:54:46,700 --> 02:54:50,200
It would help to make the jump.

3006
02:54:50,320 --> 02:54:50,460
Okay.

3007
02:54:51,840 --> 02:54:53,980
I can't, I can't get it!

3008
02:55:00,560 --> 02:55:01,920
I wish

3009
02:55:05,400 --> 02:55:10,180
they would stop following each other because it's really...

3010
02:55:13,970 --> 02:55:15,970
It's really not so nice.

3011
02:55:18,830 --> 02:55:20,530
Okay, it may be here.

3012
02:55:22,710 --> 02:55:23,210
Oh wait!

3013
02:55:24,370 --> 02:55:24,830
Yeah!

3014
02:55:25,930 --> 02:55:27,210
Okay, awesome.

3015
02:55:28,070 --> 02:55:28,410
Awesome.

3016
02:55:28,990 --> 02:55:31,170
I got married this weekend.

3017
02:55:31,590 --> 02:55:34,830
And we played a few of your covers on the reception.

3018
02:55:36,410 --> 02:55:38,250
Many new wishes were made that evening.

3019
02:55:38,890 --> 02:55:39,830
Thanks for being awesome.

3020
02:55:40,330 --> 02:55:42,270
Um, congratulations!

3021
02:55:43,430 --> 02:55:44,270
What the heck?

3022
02:55:47,650 --> 02:55:48,170
My?

3023
02:55:48,530 --> 02:55:49,530
My songs?

3024
02:55:52,970 --> 02:55:54,190
I'm sorry.

3025
02:56:03,240 --> 02:56:05,540
I hope people liked it.

3026
02:56:08,880 --> 02:56:11,340
What was the point of this thing then?

3027
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:15,120
Last from the past.

3028
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:18,060
Everybody's seen my favorite maze playing something so dear to my childhood.

3029
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:18,500
Have you had fun?

3030
02:56:18,820 --> 02:56:20,080
Thank you so much!

3031
02:56:20,220 --> 02:56:21,160
Thank you, thank you!

3032
02:56:21,300 --> 02:56:22,160
Thanks for the super chat.

3033
02:56:22,280 --> 02:56:23,220
And I'm having fun.

3034
02:56:23,640 --> 02:56:24,440
Thank you.

3035
02:56:26,620 --> 02:56:27,060
Oh!

3036
02:56:30,340 --> 02:56:30,700
Oh!

3037
02:56:38,570 --> 02:56:39,410
There we go.

3038
02:56:39,630 --> 02:56:39,850
Okay.

3039
02:56:44,570 --> 02:56:46,530
My bad.

3040
02:56:50,810 --> 02:56:53,450
Don't worry about it.

3041
02:56:55,190 --> 02:56:56,350
Okay, let's see.

3042
02:56:57,110 --> 02:56:59,050
Left, right, middle.

3043
02:56:59,670 --> 02:57:00,230
Okay, easy.

3044
02:57:05,210 --> 02:57:05,610
Whoa!

3045
02:57:08,190 --> 02:57:09,710
Into this.

3046
02:57:11,150 --> 02:57:12,970
I don't remember any of them.

3047
02:57:15,330 --> 02:57:19,070
I don't remember any of this part for...

3048
02:57:19,070 --> 02:57:21,170
The Last Crusade?

3049
02:57:22,110 --> 02:57:23,670
The Trials or whatever?

3050
02:57:28,510 --> 02:57:28,930
Oh, here.

3051
02:57:30,630 --> 02:57:31,830
You think we can make it?

3052
02:57:32,510 --> 02:57:33,070
Oh, yeah.

3053
02:57:33,830 --> 02:57:34,570
Oh, yeah.

3054
02:57:35,450 --> 02:57:36,210
Oh, yeah.

3055
02:57:38,110 --> 02:57:41,130
I like these, like, very Lego-colored.

3056
02:57:42,870 --> 02:57:44,990
They're my favorite part, actually.

3057
02:57:44,990 --> 02:57:48,910
How they're just why it is so bright, you know?

3058
02:57:53,320 --> 02:57:54,660
It's so funny.

3059
02:57:56,600 --> 02:57:57,640
I want that.

3060
02:57:58,540 --> 02:58:00,400
Holy moly, this area is actually humongous.

3061
02:58:04,340 --> 02:58:07,740
Oh, Sala fell, so it's a good thing we did that.

3062
02:58:11,680 --> 02:58:14,000
The purple, I know, I want to get it.

3063
02:58:16,480 --> 02:58:17,000
Snakes!

3064
02:58:17,340 --> 02:58:18,760
Why is there gonna be snakes?

3065
02:58:18,780 --> 02:58:19,400
Thanks.

3066
02:58:19,580 --> 02:58:20,060
Oh, oh.

3067
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:20,640
Oops.

3068
02:58:22,760 --> 02:58:24,660
Oh, oh, oh, Andy.

3069
02:58:25,880 --> 02:58:26,200
Indiana Jones.

3070
02:58:27,240 --> 02:58:27,460
Okay.

3071
02:58:28,080 --> 02:58:29,780
I wanted to switch to him, but I...

3072
02:58:35,960 --> 02:58:36,820
All right.

3073
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:37,900
Careful.

3074
02:58:38,260 --> 02:58:38,580
Easy now.

3075
02:58:38,840 --> 02:58:39,240
Easy now.

3076
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:41,800
Easy now.

3077
02:58:42,100 --> 02:58:42,400
Easy now.

3078
02:58:43,540 --> 02:58:45,800
This is just a place to give money.

3079
02:58:46,300 --> 02:58:46,860
Sounds good.

3080
02:58:47,420 --> 02:58:48,080
I love that.

3081
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:51,760
It's like Roblox.

3082
02:58:52,560 --> 02:58:53,280
Oof.

3083
02:58:55,420 --> 02:58:55,760
Welcome back.

3084
02:58:55,860 --> 02:58:57,080
Thank you.

3085
02:58:59,100 --> 02:59:00,880
And why he orpul?

3086
02:59:01,300 --> 02:59:03,920
Okay, we're gonna get this first try.

3087
02:59:07,950 --> 02:59:10,190
Did you see that?

3088
02:59:15,530 --> 02:59:18,390
We do be gaming sometimes.

3089
02:59:23,260 --> 02:59:24,960
Oh, gosh, that, oh my gosh.

3090
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:28,400
we almost did not make that because somebody

3091
02:59:34,990 --> 03:00:00,290
we think okay it looks like I can light a fire in there so I gotta jump to the other side okay there we go nice so this will keep the snakes away from for eternity good job I don't like that I can hear them like this sounds like spaghetti not spaghetti mac and cheese when you stir the mac and cheese and cheese.

3092
03:00:01,690 --> 03:00:03,530
Definitely getting that kind of vibe.

3093
03:00:04,530 --> 03:00:05,170
First try!

3094
03:00:07,430 --> 03:00:09,510
First try, first try.

3095
03:00:16,350 --> 03:00:19,490
I wish I could ride that so I could get the coins on there, but whatever.

3096
03:00:21,590 --> 03:00:22,050
Oh, wow.

3097
03:00:23,030 --> 03:00:24,070
That's all that there was?

3098
03:00:25,570 --> 03:00:27,230
But, this part, too.

3099
03:00:28,150 --> 03:00:32,990
I think I can't do this because I don't have a person with, like, a eternal wrench.

3100
03:00:33,290 --> 03:00:33,690
Also, why?

3101
03:00:34,230 --> 03:00:36,350
Oh, it's not sticking out.

3102
03:00:36,490 --> 03:00:37,010
Oh, that's what...

3103
03:00:37,010 --> 03:00:38,570
I was like, why can't I grab that?

3104
03:00:39,170 --> 03:00:39,750
Ah, yeah.

3105
03:00:40,490 --> 03:00:42,610
I think I can't fix that.

3106
03:00:42,870 --> 03:00:43,710
So that stays...

3107
03:00:43,710 --> 03:00:44,550
That's inside.

3108
03:00:45,150 --> 03:00:46,350
And so I can't go upwards.

3109
03:00:46,490 --> 03:00:47,350
What's up there anyway?

3110
03:00:47,870 --> 03:00:48,810
Oh, it's just a chest.

3111
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:55,980
Okay.

3112
03:00:57,340 --> 03:00:57,780
Hi.

3113
03:01:00,750 --> 03:01:01,170
Hey.

3114
03:01:01,750 --> 03:01:04,070
Oh, no.

3115
03:01:04,190 --> 03:01:05,990
This is, like, the worst camera angle ever.

3116
03:01:07,650 --> 03:01:08,090
Okay.

3117
03:01:08,310 --> 03:01:08,610
Hey.

3118
03:01:09,950 --> 03:01:10,350
Eight!

3119
03:01:14,090 --> 03:01:14,290
Oh!

3120
03:01:16,910 --> 03:01:17,310
Wait!

3121
03:01:22,120 --> 03:01:23,980
Depth, my depth perception, everybody!

3122
03:01:24,500 --> 03:01:26,040
Pray for me!

3123
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:26,500
Eight!

3124
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:28,100
Oh, dang it.

3125
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:29,540
Oh, that's fine, that's fine.

3126
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:30,000
Eight!

3127
03:01:30,640 --> 03:01:32,220
Ah, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

3128
03:01:34,820 --> 03:01:36,600
Oh my god, Zala, you almost didn't make it, buddy!

3129
03:01:37,220 --> 03:01:37,380
Oh!

3130
03:01:40,360 --> 03:01:41,480
What did that spell?

3131
03:01:43,300 --> 03:01:43,800
Close!

3132
03:01:44,320 --> 03:01:44,320
Busters!

3133
03:01:50,540 --> 03:01:51,040
Tempting.

3134
03:01:55,450 --> 03:01:55,850
Never mind.

3135
03:01:56,290 --> 03:01:57,490
It's not worth the money.

3136
03:01:58,770 --> 03:02:00,770
We'll lose more than we will gain.

3137
03:02:04,590 --> 03:02:09,230
Oh, I thought I saw a light back there, but I think it's just like the way that the light is.

3138
03:02:12,470 --> 03:02:15,250
This is like looking so cinematic, no?

3139
03:02:23,430 --> 03:02:26,550
Maybe I do need to go over there, though.

3140
03:02:27,130 --> 03:02:28,310
I can't make this, can I?

3141
03:02:33,660 --> 03:02:35,320
Is this the invisible bridge?

3142
03:02:40,940 --> 03:02:42,360
Oh my gosh.

3143
03:02:42,520 --> 03:02:43,260
Wait, but it...

3144
03:02:43,260 --> 03:02:44,320
Wait, look at it, too.

3145
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:47,780
Like, look at the...

3146
03:02:47,780 --> 03:02:49,240
Like, it looks...

3147
03:02:49,240 --> 03:02:50,240
Oh, it looks so cool.

3148
03:02:50,460 --> 03:02:50,760
Sorry.

3149
03:02:51,760 --> 03:02:52,880
I just thought it looked neat.

3150
03:02:53,820 --> 03:02:54,560
I just thought...

3151
03:02:54,580 --> 03:02:55,520
I thought it was neat.

3152
03:02:55,640 --> 03:02:56,320
That's all.

3153
03:02:58,300 --> 03:02:58,820
Yee-hoo!

3154
03:02:59,440 --> 03:03:00,540
That's our first one.

3155
03:03:00,800 --> 03:03:00,980
Yikes.

3156
03:03:06,540 --> 03:03:08,560
Floating like a real ghost.

3157
03:03:08,880 --> 03:03:09,640
I do do that.

3158
03:03:10,480 --> 03:03:10,920
Sometimes.

3159
03:03:11,860 --> 03:03:12,540
It takes a lot.

3160
03:03:12,720 --> 03:03:15,680
Oh, it doesn't take a lot of energy, but it's just like...

3161
03:03:16,300 --> 03:03:18,960
I'd rather save my, you know...

3162
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:22,460
If I use too much energy, you guys won't be able to see me.

3163
03:03:22,560 --> 03:03:24,900
I'll be like a little wisp like you guys.

3164
03:03:26,700 --> 03:03:27,660
That's why I'm always high.

3165
03:03:27,680 --> 03:03:33,920
haunting so much that I can be in this form and all.

3166
03:03:45,510 --> 03:03:48,330
I'm pushing, I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

3167
03:03:52,580 --> 03:03:53,220
What's it showing?

3168
03:03:56,850 --> 03:03:57,980
Is it showing the bridge?

3169
03:04:02,040 --> 03:04:02,480
Cool.

3170
03:04:09,050 --> 03:04:09,330
Nice.

3171
03:04:11,190 --> 03:04:13,470
Too much junk in the trunk to float.

3172
03:04:14,370 --> 03:04:14,730
Stop.

3173
03:04:15,190 --> 03:04:16,190
It's my insecurity.

3174
03:04:18,130 --> 03:04:18,490
Stop.

3175
03:04:18,970 --> 03:04:20,490
My big butt's an insecurity.

3176
03:04:21,110 --> 03:04:22,170
Oh, I need another torch.

3177
03:04:22,390 --> 03:04:22,970
Okay, hold on.

3178
03:04:23,650 --> 03:04:24,870
We can do this one.

3179
03:04:25,050 --> 03:04:26,010
I just gotta go find one.

3180
03:04:26,970 --> 03:04:28,130
Just gotta go find the torch.

3181
03:04:29,270 --> 03:04:31,030
I think it was at the very beginning, though.

3182
03:04:32,150 --> 03:04:33,310
We backtracked just a tad.

3183
03:04:33,930 --> 03:04:36,110
Look, you can even see it in the distance.

3184
03:04:36,350 --> 03:04:37,190
Kind of as like a hint.

3185
03:04:38,690 --> 03:04:39,590
Will we make it, though?

3186
03:04:39,830 --> 03:04:40,570
That's another question.

3187
03:04:50,980 --> 03:04:53,100
Hugh Jass is calling you.

3188
03:04:53,520 --> 03:04:54,900
Will you pick up?

3189
03:04:57,080 --> 03:04:57,900
I don't know.

3190
03:04:58,000 --> 03:04:58,840
What's he got to say?

3191
03:04:58,900 --> 03:04:59,760
I can't see Sala.

3192
03:04:59,980 --> 03:05:00,260
Sala.

3193
03:05:00,520 --> 03:05:00,800
Sala.

3194
03:05:01,140 --> 03:05:01,480
Sala.

3195
03:05:02,160 --> 03:05:02,620
Oh my god.

3196
03:05:02,760 --> 03:05:03,580
Wait, I can't see.

3197
03:05:03,740 --> 03:05:04,480
I think it was this.

3198
03:05:04,660 --> 03:05:04,940
This.

3199
03:05:05,440 --> 03:05:05,720
This.

3200
03:05:06,040 --> 03:05:06,900
Oh, I messed up.

3201
03:05:07,340 --> 03:05:08,080
Sala, move!

3202
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:11,760
You stand here.

3203
03:05:12,040 --> 03:05:12,680
I stand.

3204
03:05:13,700 --> 03:05:13,920
Here.

3205
03:05:14,820 --> 03:05:16,400
He got closer.

3206
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:24,360
Easy!

3207
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:32,800
What is this now?

3208
03:05:42,940 --> 03:05:44,740
Oh, you can see it!

3209
03:05:45,180 --> 03:05:46,640
So cool!

3210
03:05:49,160 --> 03:05:50,320
So, so cool.

3211
03:05:52,740 --> 03:05:53,460
Have faith.

3212
03:05:57,900 --> 03:05:58,720
Oh my god.

3213
03:06:02,840 --> 03:06:03,200
Hey!

3214
03:06:04,740 --> 03:06:06,040
We're here.

3215
03:06:06,580 --> 03:06:07,640
You want me to move!

3216
03:06:13,870 --> 03:06:15,270
Oh my god, he's dying!

3217
03:06:15,450 --> 03:06:16,070
He's laughing!

3218
03:06:16,250 --> 03:06:16,770
Oh my god!

3219
03:06:17,010 --> 03:06:18,450
Oh my god!

3220
03:06:25,510 --> 03:06:26,310
Final boss?

3221
03:06:28,410 --> 03:06:29,010
Oh my god.

3222
03:06:30,270 --> 03:06:31,330
Hey, hey, chill out!

3223
03:06:31,410 --> 03:06:31,870
Chill out, buddy!

3224
03:06:32,770 --> 03:06:33,750
Okay, I need you to dig.

3225
03:06:34,470 --> 03:06:34,710
Dig.

3226
03:06:40,510 --> 03:06:42,450
Put it in here...

3227
03:06:44,110 --> 03:06:44,910
And... home?

3228
03:06:50,300 --> 03:06:52,240
How do I know which one though?

3229
03:06:53,440 --> 03:06:53,980
Wait a second.

3230
03:06:54,920 --> 03:06:57,040
What am I supposed to know which one?

3231
03:06:58,860 --> 03:06:59,980
Ah, yippee!

3232
03:07:02,180 --> 03:07:03,060
What do you have to say?

3233
03:07:03,240 --> 03:07:06,700
Middle, up, left, left.

3234
03:07:12,240 --> 03:07:14,540
A cup of a carpenter.

3235
03:07:21,340 --> 03:07:24,920
Isn't it like the one that's not super fancy and...

3236
03:07:24,940 --> 03:07:27,040
It looks kinda bad.

3237
03:07:28,500 --> 03:07:29,780
No offense to it.

3238
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:31,220
You okay there buddy?

3239
03:07:40,890 --> 03:07:41,570
Kiss me!

3240
03:07:42,130 --> 03:07:42,570
Just kidding.

3241
03:07:42,890 --> 03:07:43,350
Not you.

3242
03:07:45,430 --> 03:07:45,870
Sorry.

3243
03:07:50,110 --> 03:07:51,770
Oh, lots of money in here.

3244
03:07:53,330 --> 03:07:54,910
I love grave robbing!

3245
03:07:57,030 --> 03:07:58,730
Stop bullying him.

3246
03:08:03,470 --> 03:08:04,890
That- is that one, right?

3247
03:08:04,990 --> 03:08:05,890
It's this one, right here.

3248
03:08:10,580 --> 03:08:12,500
That one that's not very pretty.

3249
03:08:21,320 --> 03:08:22,980
The music is so urgent.

3250
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:24,120
We're okay!

3251
03:08:24,380 --> 03:08:25,000
We're okay!

3252
03:08:26,900 --> 03:08:27,440
We're okay!

3253
03:08:29,380 --> 03:08:30,000
Here we go!

3254
03:08:31,300 --> 03:08:32,220
Bottoms up!

3255
03:08:34,620 --> 03:08:37,140
I wonder what happens if we were to, like, die.

3256
03:08:37,320 --> 03:08:38,820
Or if we picked the wrong one, what would happen?

3257
03:08:42,160 --> 03:08:45,620
Oh my god, give it to my legless father, please!

3258
03:08:53,800 --> 03:08:55,340
She's trying to seduce him.

3259
03:09:03,980 --> 03:09:04,560
Oh, wow.

3260
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:06,260
He didn't even attempt to save her.

3261
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:14,000
Wait, that's it.

3262
03:09:16,810 --> 03:09:17,730
Oh, my God.

3263
03:09:20,150 --> 03:09:20,590
Wait.

3264
03:09:20,790 --> 03:09:21,790
In the movie, he, like...

3265
03:09:22,450 --> 03:09:23,030
Oh, I'm sorry.

3266
03:09:23,150 --> 03:09:23,830
I forgot to warn you.

3267
03:09:23,890 --> 03:09:25,550
He definitely goes back for her.

3268
03:09:30,970 --> 03:09:32,890
Oh my gosh!

3269
03:09:33,930 --> 03:09:34,870
Let's finish the story!

3270
03:09:38,250 --> 03:09:39,250
Roll credits.

3271
03:09:43,050 --> 03:09:43,650
Yeah!

3272
03:09:44,050 --> 03:09:44,630
Woohoo!

3273
03:09:45,090 --> 03:09:46,510
We all made it out alive!

3274
03:09:47,130 --> 03:09:47,970
All of us!

3275
03:09:50,150 --> 03:09:50,750
See ya!

3276
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:52,010
We don't want to beat ya!

3277
03:09:52,610 --> 03:09:53,930
Have a nice summer!

3278
03:09:54,490 --> 03:09:55,530
See you next fall!

3279
03:10:02,260 --> 03:10:03,740
Why is he doing that?

3280
03:10:04,320 --> 03:10:05,560
Why is he doing that to the horse?

3281
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:08,040
Tags!

3282
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:10,500
Why is he doing that?

3283
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:14,260
Does he feel so good with his legs again?

3284
03:10:20,500 --> 03:10:22,400
Okay, I'm gonna get copyright struck.

3285
03:10:24,360 --> 03:10:26,960
We're at 64.8%.

3286
03:10:27,540 --> 03:10:29,120
Wait, it's so little, actually.

3287
03:10:32,900 --> 03:10:33,460
Yay!

3288
03:10:34,780 --> 03:10:37,140
I guess it's so low because, uh...

3289
03:10:37,140 --> 03:10:38,700
Shortbound, because, uh...

3290
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:41,140
The artifacts, mostly.

3291
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:46,840
Bazooka Troopa.

3292
03:10:52,800 --> 03:10:54,480
I can't afford him.

3293
03:10:54,600 --> 03:10:55,640
Well, no, we'll get this guy.

3294
03:10:58,700 --> 03:10:59,020
Wait!

3295
03:10:59,680 --> 03:11:02,040
We have some people that are locked!

3296
03:11:02,380 --> 03:11:03,160
Wait, how?

3297
03:11:03,520 --> 03:11:05,700
The Grail Knight is 100,000!

3298
03:11:05,940 --> 03:11:06,380
I want...

3299
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:07,420
I want him.

3300
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:10,460
Yay!

3301
03:11:11,140 --> 03:11:15,840
Well, I had no intentions on, like, 100%ing the game, so I think it's okay, you know?

3302
03:11:17,640 --> 03:11:19,840
To leave as is.

3303
03:11:22,940 --> 03:11:23,880
This was fun.

3304
03:11:24,180 --> 03:11:25,420
There are some bonus stages.

3305
03:11:26,160 --> 03:11:27,940
Who the hell are you?

3306
03:11:28,140 --> 03:11:29,060
Wait, come here.

3307
03:11:29,520 --> 03:11:30,960

03:14:11,830 --> 03:14:13,490
Lego Indiana Jones.

3352
03:14:13,690 --> 03:14:14,210
It's fun, Mito.

3353
03:14:14,310 --> 03:14:16,050
I hope you check out other classic Legos.

3354
03:14:16,410 --> 03:14:16,430
Yes!

3355
03:14:16,930 --> 03:14:17,250
Oh, wait.

3356
03:14:18,550 --> 03:14:18,870
Sorry.

3357
03:14:19,250 --> 03:14:20,290
I'm not trying to be destructive.

3358
03:14:20,830 --> 03:14:22,490
I'm trying to be hot and sexy.

3359
03:14:23,890 --> 03:14:26,270
I'm trying to woo a lady.

3360
03:14:27,290 --> 03:14:28,430
Um, what was I saying?

3361
03:14:29,190 --> 03:14:29,830
Oh, yeah.

3362
03:14:29,910 --> 03:14:32,010
I definitely want to play the other Lego games.

3363
03:14:32,170 --> 03:14:34,430
Um, maybe just like a bit of a break.

3364
03:14:34,450 --> 03:15:06,990
I might like kind of see what they look like like I might look them up on YouTube first to see kind of what the gameplay style and like how it how it would might maybe make me feel you know what I mean gosh we only got 67 out of 180 treasure boxes that's crazy hmm You can see how your eyes adjust to it too.

3365
03:15:07,250 --> 03:15:10,090
I don't know if it's like, I was wondering, I was like, is it the camera angles?

3366
03:15:10,210 --> 03:15:10,870
Is it the frame rate?

3367
03:15:10,950 --> 03:15:11,930
Is it the colors?

3368
03:15:12,190 --> 03:15:16,830
Like, there's just something really, something about it.

3369
03:15:17,290 --> 03:15:19,190
As much as I want to be like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3370
03:15:19,870 --> 03:15:25,010
But the last two times I was so low energy and it was because the game was just making me so sick.

3371
03:15:26,790 --> 03:15:28,810
But I definitely want to play Lego Batman.

3372
03:15:30,210 --> 03:15:30,790
If anything.

3373
03:15:34,630 --> 03:15:35,350
It's cursed.

3374
03:15:36,510 --> 03:15:41,030
Yeah, I want to play a game with the Lego voice acting.

3375
03:15:42,990 --> 03:15:44,370
Look at her hips, man.

3376
03:15:45,490 --> 03:15:47,850
Why are you walking like that for a Lego lady?

3377
03:15:48,690 --> 03:15:50,350
Look at her hips.

3378
03:15:51,210 --> 03:15:52,930
Look at her hips, man.

3379
03:15:54,250 --> 03:15:57,750
There ain't no reason to be walking so sexy like that, madame.

3380
03:16:00,750 --> 03:16:02,210
I'm trying to grab her.

3381
03:16:02,590 --> 03:16:03,390
Try to grab her.

3382
03:16:03,470 --> 03:16:03,990
This is me.

3383
03:16:04,510 --> 03:16:05,890
This is me when I see a cute girl.

3384
03:16:05,910 --> 03:16:06,930
on the streets.

3385
03:16:07,490 --> 03:16:07,950
I'm like

3386
03:16:11,450 --> 03:16:11,850
anyway.

3387
03:16:12,630 --> 03:16:13,110
Thank you guys.

3388
03:16:13,290 --> 03:16:13,870
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

3389
03:16:14,670 --> 03:16:22,670
And I don't really it's not like there's like a cutscene or anything, so I don't really know how to end it, but I'm just gonna say Lego.

3390
03:16:23,370 --> 03:16:24,170
My ego!

3391
03:16:26,120 --> 03:16:26,440
Vito!

3392
03:16:26,980 --> 03:16:29,120
Thank you guys for the stream.

3393
03:16:29,440 --> 03:16:30,160
I hope you had fun.

3394
03:16:30,400 --> 03:16:30,820
I had fun.

3395
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:34,800
I will see you guys when I see you next.

3396
03:16:35,020 --> 03:16:35,620
It's a Vito.

3397
03:16:35,820 --> 03:16:36,260
It's a Vito.

3398
03:16:37,420 --> 03:16:41,220
Thank you, thank you, thank you, bye bye, bye, bye, bye.

3399
03:16:41,420 --> 03:16:43,140
Oh, wait, I have to exit the game.

3400
03:16:43,960 --> 03:16:44,700
I forgot.

3401
03:16:45,020 --> 03:16:46,460
My stream deck doesn't work.

3402
03:16:48,700 --> 03:16:49,920
I have to go back.

3403
03:16:50,500 --> 03:16:53,880
I have to exit the game and exit to Windows.

3404
03:16:55,000 --> 03:16:56,440
I have to do all this first.

3405
03:16:56,720 --> 03:16:57,560
So I have access.

3406
03:16:57,780 --> 03:16:57,900
Oh.

3407
03:16:59,080 --> 03:16:59,560
What?

3408
03:16:59,780 --> 03:17:00,320
Are we good?

3409
03:17:00,740 --> 03:17:02,280
So I have access to my mouse.

3410
03:17:04,640 --> 03:17:06,680
Bye bye, bye, bye, bye.

3411
03:17:07,280 --> 03:17:08,120
Thank you!

3412
03:17:08,200 --> 03:17:08,880
Bye bye!
