1
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,700
After the SDV gets as close as it can, dispose of it.

2
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,780
From there on, you'll have to swim.

3
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,340
High tech special forces unit Foxhound.

4
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,240
Your former unit, and one that I was a commander of.

5
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,020
So they're still around.

6
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,920
There are six members of Foxhound involved in this terrorist activity.

7
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,300
Psycho Mattis, with his powerful psychic abilities.

8
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
Sniper Wolf, a beautiful and deadly sharpshooter.

9
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,120
Decoy Octopus, master of disguise.

10
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,320
Vulcan Raven, giant and shaman.

11
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,960
And Revolver Ocelot, specialist in interrogation, and a formidable gunfighter.

12
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,540
And finally, in charge of them, Foxhound's squad leader.

13
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,300
Liquid Snake.

14
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,020
Liquid Snake?

15
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,880
The man with the same code name as you.

16
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,980
The nuclear weapons disposal.

17
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,820
It covers the whole island.

18
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,700
I'll instruct you by codec after you reach your target.

19
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,420
Anyone going with me?

20
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,560
Don't look at my panties.

21
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,420
This is a one man infiltration mission.

22
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,560
Weapons and equipment OSP?

23
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,500
Yes.

24
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,700
This is a top secret black op.

25
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,760
Don't expect any official support.

26
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,460
That's just like my real head.

27
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,080
Oh my god.

28
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,260
Why do you swim like that?

29
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm as elegant as a dolphin.

30
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,120
What are you talking about?

31
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,760
Hello everybody!

32
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,580
Welcome back!

33
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,440
Welcome back to Metal Gear Solid Integral.

34
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,540
Press the start button.

35
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,800
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back.

36
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:37,920
Did you notice something a little special about the game?

37
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,240
Isn't it cold AF in Alaska in your main outfit?

38
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,160
Don't worry.

39
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm a ghost.

40
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,960
It doesn't even matter.

41
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,860
Snake is cute.

42
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,240
He's always cute.

43
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,520
What are you talking about?

44
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,260
Seems pretty normal to me.

45
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,040
Yes.

46
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,300
I am playing the...

47
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,120
mod swapped version.

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,280
Where I will be!

49
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,060
Solid Snake!

50
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,140
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,620
No more.

52
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,360
There we go.

53
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:09,600
Okay.

54
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,480
Hello boss.

55
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,560
Good to have you with us.

56
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:14,840
So...

57
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,700
Actually...

58
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,260
Jeremy hooked me up with like a save...

59
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,840
of where I was at exactly basically.

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,000
So...

61
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
We're just picking up where we left off.

62
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,760
But instead of Snake, it's me.

63
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,260
So...

64
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,800
Thank you.

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,780
Thank you guys for helping me out with getting this all set up.

66
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,760
Especially in time for the finale.

67
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,040
Ghosts don't belong in Alaska.

68
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,020
So...

69
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,900
Yeah.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm so excited.

71
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,880
And nervous.

72
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,060
Let's see.

73
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,140
Let's see how it looks.

74
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,880
Oh my gosh.

75
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,340
Oh my gosh.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,220
Now we don't need the...

77
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,040
The mission log...

78
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,840
The lition...

79
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,180
Mog.

80
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,690
Mom!

81
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,390
Mom!

82
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,470
I made the...

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,360
Wait.

84
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,220
Can I Beyblade?

85
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:27,600
No.

86
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,880
I'm so excited.

87
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,500
Letter rip!

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:34,740
Yay!

89
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
Are you also a liquid snake?

90
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Since their...

91
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:39,940
Wait.

92
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,180
Oh.

93
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,920
It disappeared.

94
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,500
What the heck?

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,220
Thank you for the sabotage!

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,360
Yeah!

97
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,180
Here I go.

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,600
Oh my gosh.

99
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,240
Look at me!

100
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,840
Oh my gosh.

101
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,660
In the future, I should commission a...

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:55,920
Like...

103
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,160
Me in a sneaking suit.

104
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,820
Oh my gosh, look at me!

105
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,360
Look at me!

106
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,320
Okay, got my stuff.

107
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,820
I got full rations.

108
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,080
I got my other stuff.

109
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,360
Okay, we're all good, I think.

110
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,440
Look at me!

111
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,820
It's so cute!

112
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,640
I did not expect a vent mod.

113
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,820
It's pretty awesome, right?

114
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,920
Oh my gosh, mom!

115
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm in the game!

116
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,740
Oh my gosh, it's so awesome!

117
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,540
Man!

118
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,640
Oh, I already have rations.

119
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,660
Wait, how's my health anyway?

120
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,780
Oh, there it is.

121
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,040
Oh, full.

122
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,120
We're set to go, baby.

123
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,980
We're set to go.

124
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
The legendary Solid Mint.

125
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,420
Yes!

126
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,280
So today we will be completing Metal Gear Solid.

127
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,360
We got a little bit to go, so it'll be a little bit.

128
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,400
But hopefully we can believe in my gamer abilities.

129
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
My abilities as a soldier.

130
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,340
As a gamer.

131
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,920
Congrats on debuting on your first of many Metal Gear universe on livestream.

132
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,660
Love can bloom on the battlefield.

133
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,300
Solid Mint is a ghost.

134
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,140
Why doesn't she go?

135
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,480
Go through the walls to stop Rex.

136
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Fake ghost.

137
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,460
Hey, I'm doing this fair and square, okay?

138
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,500
Fair and square.

139
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,200
But, yeah!

140
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,760
So...

141
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,480
I don't really know what else to say.

142
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,200
I'm nervous about fighting Vulcan Raven.

143
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,660
Because he's so difficult.

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,400
But...

145
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,420
I'll do my...

146
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,800
My roux bestie.

147
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,160
How do I look in the box?

148
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,680
It probably looks the same, right?

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,140
Oh, you can see my little feet!

150
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,760
Yeah, it looks the same.

151
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,500
Right?

152
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,340
Oh, man!

153
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,140
What would be funny?

154
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,840
All of the Metal Gear series that is 3D changes Snake to Mint.

155
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,260
After this game, Peace Walker to MGS3.

156
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,800
I don't know.

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,740
A 4 and 5 modded... Once I get a 3D model, maybe we can put it in...

158
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,880
I feel like by the time I get around to playing 5...

159
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,660
By the time I get around to playing 5...

160
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:36,080
I will have to have a 3D model by then, right?

161
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,980
No sneaking suit during the liquid fist fight, right?

162
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,320
How is that gonna...

163
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,200
How is that gonna look?

164
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,160
Wait...

165
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:49,620
Jeremy!

166
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,240
Are they gonna take off my clothes?

167
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,460
Jeremy!

168
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,340
Wait!

169
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,680
Am I gonna be...

170
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,700
Am I gonna be...

171
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,540
Finally get my undies?

172
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,600
What's going on?

173
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,200
No...

174
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,800
Oh, man.

175
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,620
You are not gonna be naked.

176
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,980
Man, you had an opportunity!

177
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,100
You had an opportunity!

178
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,900
Maybe you should fix it...

179
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,120
For when everybody else uses this mod.

180
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:26,500
For when everybody else uses this mod.

181
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,740
Can't wait for Metal Gear 1 and 2 mod.

182
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,360
Can't wait for Metal Gear 1 and 2 mod.

183
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,840
I'll be there no matter what.

184
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,180
You won't be streaming on my birthday.

185
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,320
You won't be streaming on my birthday.

186
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,040
Happy early birthday!

187
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,020
I'll sing real fast so we can suddenly get into the...

188
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,120
I'll sing real fast so we can suddenly get into the...

189
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm quite busy today, actually.

190
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,220
I was like, Oh my gosh.

191
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,780
Should I be even streaming such a long thing?

192
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,700
Because I have so much to do before tomorrow.

193
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,360
But...

194
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,760
It's okay.

195
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,620
Instead, I...

196
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,780
Instead, I edited a video that I didn't need to necessarily put out.

197
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,240
And then, also, I worked on this.

198
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,780
So, you know...

199
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,400
I think I used my time wisely instead of packing and practicing.

200
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,300
Whatever.

201
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,980
Happy birthday to you.

202
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,760
Happy birthday to you.

203
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,140
Happy birthday to you.

204
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,660
Happy birthday dear Wii U.

205
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:28,460
Happy birthday to Wii U.

206
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,340
Alright, guys.

207
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:38,300
I don't remember the strat for beating Vulcan Raven, so...

208
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,100
I think it's like, just put C4 down and don't forget where you put it.

209
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,360
Oh my gosh, we're gonna see the cutscene with me.

210
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,980
This is gonna be crazy.

211
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,220
Why is my mouth, like...

212
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,500
like a cat shape?

213
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,180
Oh my gosh, I can't see anything.

214
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,620
Oh my gosh, it's so bright!

215
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,600
My eyes!

216
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,110
Welcome, Cossack.

217
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,870
This is the end of the road for you.

218
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,670
Right, my friends?

219
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,910
Listen, baby.

220
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,430
Happy birthday, dear Wii U.

221
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,850
Happy birthday, dear Wii U.

222
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,750
Happy birthday, dear Lime.

223
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,970
Happy birthday, dear Lime.

224
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,890
Very sick!

225
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,930
Deserves all the thanks for getting this thing off the ground.

226
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:34,610
Very sick!

227
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,290
Thank you.

228
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,290
Thank you so much!

229
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,550
I feel like crying, I'm so happy.

230
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,550
It's so funny because I look so anime in this.

231
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,250
That's an eagle.

232
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,070
Oh!

233
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,010
I look so... everybody doesn't have an eye...

234
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,390
Oh my god!

235
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:01,850
This is...

236
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,030
The raven's on me!

237
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:10,050
I'm a Japanese princess!

238
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:16,950
Oh my gosh, my eyes are so...

239
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,430
I can't move!

240
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,450
I'm a Japanese princess!

241
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:31,570
Oh my gosh!

242
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:31,750
Thank you for the five gifts!

243
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,270
Thank you!

244
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,410
Yes!

245
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,950
You live in Alaska too.

246
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:38,770
I do.

247
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,090
Do you know of the World Eskimo Indian Olympics?

248
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,150
Yeah, I know it.

249
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,890
Must be a real thrill in the Muk-Tuck eating contest.

250
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,750
Yes, you are right.

251
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,090
But there is another event that I excel at.

252
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,710
It is called the Ear Pool.

253
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,710
It is an event where two opponents pull each other's ears while enduring the harsh cold.

254
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,550
Never would have thought of that.

255
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:03,510
You test spiritual as well as physical strength.

256
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,550
The ear pull.

257
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,910
You want to pull each other's ears?

258
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,070
I look so smug!

259
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,470
Rejoice, snake!

260
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,950
Ours will be a glorious battle.

261
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,450
This isn't glorious.

262
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,870
It's just plain killing.

263
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,610
Violence isn't a sport.

264
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,330
Yeah, violence isn't a sport!

265
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,290
We'll see if there's iron in your words.

266
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,670
Uh oh.

267
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,330
Oh my gosh.

268
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,470
Oh my gosh.

269
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,150
I'm not ready.

270
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,090
I'm not ready for this battle.

271
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:30,730
Oh my gosh.

272
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:31,570
I'm not ready for this battle.

273
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,990
Don't see me!

274
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:33,870
Okay.

275
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:34,830
Let's see.

276
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,220
Does stun grenades work on him?

277
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,580
I have quite a bit, actually.

278
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,160
Run, Mito, run!

279
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,460
On

280
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:00,270
the claymores, I won't remember where I do it!

281
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,790
I don't remember.

282
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,310
I don't remember.

283
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,030
Stuns don't work.

284
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,510
Okay, okay.

285
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,510
Maybe I can Nikita missile him.

286
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,710
And remember that that's technically a way you can do it.

287
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:18,670
Let's see.

288
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,930
Oh my gosh.

289
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:20,930
Oh my gosh.

290
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:21,990
He's coming this way!

291
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,090
Oh my gosh.

292
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,130
Wait, he knows where I am!

293
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,990
How does he know where I am?

294
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,050
Run, Mito, run!

295
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,870
Okay.

296
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,670
How do I shoot this thing again?

297
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,670
Oh no!

298
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,570
It's all in...

299
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:41,050
It's not...

300
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,270
Okay, so the master collection would make it to be like AB.

301
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,990
XY.

302
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,490
Okay, so X is A.

303
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,950
Square is X.

304
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,170
Oh gosh.

305
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,850
B is O.

306
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,010
Y is triangle.

307
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,890
This will confuse me, surely.

308
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,530
This surely won't confuse me.

309
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,410
Oh my god.

310
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,390
Where is he?

311
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:11,970
Don't come this way.

312
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,090
Don't come this way.

313
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,150
Don't come this way.

314
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,750
Maybe if I leave...

315
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,170
Okay, maybe if I bait him...

316
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,090
For the... C4.

317
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,690
Okay.

318
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,650
Wait, okay.

319
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,270
Square button and then B button.

320
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:23,630
Okay.

321
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,040
Bait, bait.

322
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,700
Bait him, bait him, bait him.

323
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,360
Bait him, bait him, bait him.

324
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,020
Wait, what the hell am I wearing?

325
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,980
On my head.

326
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,680
Oh, that's my hair.

327
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,860
Go up.

328
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,520
No!

329
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,040
Don't go!

330
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,420
Don't go!

331
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,000
Hey, man.

332
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,190
Hey, you're going the wrong way!

333
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,750
Okay, let's try Nikita missile again.

334
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:52,650
I remember struggling on this quite a bit.

335
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,850
Where is he though?

336
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,110
Oh my god.

337
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,610
There he is.

338
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:02,030
Ah!

339
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,110
You son of a gun.

340
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,740
Wait, wait, wait.

341
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,280
He's coming back.

342
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,820
He's coming back.

343
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,700
He can...

344
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,220
Cause...

345
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,400
Come on.

346
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,940
Go up, go up, go up.

347
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,640
He shot the missile, Minto.

348
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,420
I know, I saw.

349
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,580
Go up, go up.

350
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,700
Go up, go up.

351
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,020
Go up towards me, go up towards me.

352
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,720
Yeah, nice, nice, nice, nice.

353
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,680
This is actually good.

354
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:32,820
This is actually pretty good.

355
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,820
Keep going, keep going.

356
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,480
Maybe I should have put one where I just stood.

357
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,780
Okay, hold on.

358
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,380
Oh my god.

359
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,760
I'm gonna put one right here.

360
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,580
Slow and steady, everybody.

361
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,260
Slow and steady.

362
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,600
Wait, where did I put it?

363
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,500
Right here, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle, in the middle.

364
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Okay, in the middle.

365
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,990
Wait, no, he's coming up through the middle.

366
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:18,770
Turn!

367
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,990
Turn like... turn to the right.

368
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,370
Yes, yes, yes!

369
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,210
Wait, I'm gonna put one... here?

370
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:29,030
Oh wait, it's gonna explode the first one though, right?

371
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,250
Oh shoot.

372
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:32,250
He's going in the same pattern.

373
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,990
I wonder if he'll...

374
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm right here, dummy!

375
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,340
Snake looks cute.

376
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,180
My hair is so green here.

377
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,780
Wait, sorry.

378
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,160
Okay.

379
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,740
Put down.

380
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,140
O button.

381
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,600
Oh god.

382
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,200
Oh no, he's doing his little running bit now.

383
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,010
Oh my god.

384
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,030
You're scaring me.

385
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,330
I'm gonna put one down here again.

386
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,150
He seems to like to come over here.

387
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,470
Oh my god.

388
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:17,850
Oh my god.

389
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,810
Come over here!

390
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,450
Come over here!

391
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:23,830
What?

392
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,310
He's like huffing and puffing.

393
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,130
I think he's struggling.

394
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:31,930
What the?

395
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,070
Oh.

396
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,430
Oh my god.

397
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,190
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

398
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,150
Oh, nice.

399
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,220
You jerk!

400
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,980
Maybe I could have gotten him, but...

401
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,600
Does knocking lure him?

402
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,320
I don't think so.

403
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,180
Dang.

404
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,100
Oh my god, oh my god.

405
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,160
I know this is like the slowest ever, but...

406
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,280
Oh my god, oh my god.

407
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,860
Stop running.

408
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,660
Stop running.

409
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,340
Why are you running?

410
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,040
Oh my god.

411
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:11,980
Come on up.

412
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,520
Come on up.

413
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:12,880
Come on up.

414
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,660
I'm luring a cat.

415
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,000
And like, this is exactly what it's like to call for a cat.

416
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,180
They just don't listen to you.

417
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,020
Remember the basics of CQC.

418
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,700
Against this guy!

419
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,440
Oh my god.

420
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,300
Oh my god, oh my god.

421
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,580
Come on!

422
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:33,880
Oh!

423
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,320
Oh!

424
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh!

425
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,220
Oh!

426
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:35,420
Oh!

427
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,200
Nice!

428
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,700
Oh, he's still going.

429
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,660
Oh, he's still running.

430
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,440
Oh my god, he's still running.

431
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:48,960
Stop running!

432
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,060
You're scaring me!

433
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,220
Stop running!

434
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,620
Stop running!

435
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,260
You're scaring me!

436
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,300
Oh my god.

437
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,740
Oh my god.

438
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,460
Which way is...

439
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,640
Ah!

440
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360
You're scaring me!

441
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:03,960
You're scaring me!

442
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,360
Oh my god, oh my god.

443
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,140
Stop running, Raven.

444
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,400
Please, Vulcan Raven, please!

445
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,520
He's really getting his cardio in, man.

446
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,180
He's like going at it.

447
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,200
Come on, come on.

448
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,320
Come on, come on, come on!

449
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,600
This is the strat.

450
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,140
Ah!

451
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,800
Oh, it did barely, but that's okay.

452
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:27,980
I'm sorry.

453
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,600
I'm so scared of him.

454
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,360
I think I put it...

455
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Oh, dang it!

456
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,080
Wait, where did I put it actually?

457
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:36,520
In...

458
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,380
Okay, right there, right there.

459
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,260
Sorry, I have to be like really meticulous... or slow about this.

460
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,740
You know, meticulous, because I will forget otherwise.

461
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:53,880
Okay.

462
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:55,860
It's mint mode!

463
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,880
It's mint mode!

464
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:57,860
Oh!

465
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,280
Hold on!

466
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,820
Hold on!

467
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,480
Everybody, hold your horses.

468
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,560
Come on, he's going up!

469
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,220
He's going up!

470
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:04,920
Oh my god!

471
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,010
I accidentally put another one down.

472
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,010
It's right here.

473
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,030
It's right there.

474
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,410
I might have to go find some more.

475
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,050
Oh my gosh!

476
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:21,450
Oh my gosh!

477
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:21,850
Don't find me.

478
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:22,610
Don't see me.

479
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,130
Don't see me.

480
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,690
Don't see me.

481
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,390
Don't see me.

482
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:24,850
Don't see me.

483
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:25,690
Don't see me.

484
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:25,910
Don't see me.

485
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:26,610
Don't see me.

486
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,810
Okay, I'm gonna have to blow this one up first.

487
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,490
Alright, come up here.

488
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,250
Here's the claymore.

489
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,750
I'm afraid of running over it though, for real.

490
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,410
That was close.

491
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:47,950
Don't come down.

492
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,690
I said no, don't come down.

493
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,060
Alright, now go up.

494
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

495
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,620
Keep going up.

496
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,000
Nice!

497
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,160
This is how we do it, guys.

498
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:04,880
We're almost there!

499
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:05,480
We're almost there!

500
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,760
We're gaming!

501
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,060
Claymore's in the inner range.

502
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,540
Look at him running around like crazy.

503
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:17,820
Paperbacks!

504
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,840
Thank you for the five gifted!

505
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:26,960
I know I should set up some more, but it's also like getting it... It's fine, you guys.

506
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,400
It's fine.

507
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,620
He's running around so... He's like so tired.

508
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,920
Keep going up!

509
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,380
Keep going up!

510
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,180
Nice.

511
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,480
This is not speedrun strats, but that's okay.

512
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,300
Oh my god.

513
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:49,720
Oh my god.

514
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:49,960
Oh my god.

515
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,160
Wait.

516
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:50,980
No, he's...

517
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,850
He is.

518
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,910
Put a claymore in his path.

519
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,630
I'm so scared.

520
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,010
I'm so scared of getting blown out.

521
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,490
Oh, my rations are frozen!

522
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:07,230
Oh, shoot.

523
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,090
Okay, hold on.

524
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,350
I'll put one... here.

525
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,690
Oh my gosh.

526
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,070
Oh my gosh.

527
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,370
Scary, scary, scary, scary, scary.

528
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:16,450
Okay.

529
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,330
Um...

530
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:20,650
Uh... C4.

531
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,010
Okay.

532
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:22,850
He's coming up, I think.

533
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:23,510
He's gonna come up.

534
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:25,490
I have to be careful, though, not to...

535
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,310
Not to get blown up by the claymore.

536
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,590
If he comes around.

537
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,330
It's fine.

538
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:35,630
It's good.

539
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:36,890
Oh.

540
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:37,470
What was that?

541
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,890
He can see the claymores too, though, right?

542
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:41,290
Okay.

543
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:41,970
I'm gonna run.

544
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:42,390
Ah!

545
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,290
Oh my god.

546
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:44,910
Oh my god.

547
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,850
This is... Oh, this is bad.

548
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,350
Oh, my rations are free, though.

549
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,290
Yeah!

550
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,610
Oh, oh, bitch!

551
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:49,930
No!

552
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:06,770
Go back to where?

553
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:07,370
Wait.

554
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,390
Okay.

555
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,670
Did that ever blow up?

556
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:10,890
Oh my god.

557
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:11,370
Wait a second.

558
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:11,930
Oh.

559
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,470
Uh.

560
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:13,030
Wait.

561
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,610
It's a... Okay.

562
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:15,310
Square button.

563
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,790
Here he comes.

564
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,150
Here he comes.

565
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:19,550
Maybe.

566
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,190
He's... He's close.

567
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:21,610
He's close.

568
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,470
You exploded your C4.

569
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,510
Not me, right?

570
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,450
Oh my god.

571
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,210
Oh my god.

572
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:26,950
Don't come up here.

573
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:28,350
Unless you do.

574
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,860
He's exploding my hiding spot!

575
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,220
Here he comes.

576
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,520
Here he comes.

577
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,010
Just as the boss said.

578
00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:01,210
It is my existence which is no longer needed in this world.

579
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,970
Nice.

580
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,450
First try.

581
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,030
Yippee!

582
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:09,690
My body will not remain in this place.

583
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:15,490
My spirit and my flesh will become one with the ravens.

584
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,690
In that way, I will return to Mother Earth.

585
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,050
I was so nervous I was shaking.

586
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,570
I think it's also from...

587
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,170
I'm hungry.

588
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,370
Snake!

589
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,730
I will be watching you!

590
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:28,430
Yippee-yo!

591
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:28,850
Understand?

592
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,930
Devon, thanks for the 10 giftis!

593
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,410
Snake, take this security card.

594
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,670
It will open that door.

595
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,450
Why are you helping me?

596
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:41,870
Why?

597
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:46,270
You are a snake which was not created by nature.

598
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,110
I look so happy.

599
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,470
You and the boss.

600
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,350
You are from another world.

601
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:55,590
A world that I do not wish to know.

602
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,890
Go and do battle with him.

603
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,150
I will be watching from above.

604
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,770
First, I'll give you a hint.

605
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:06,390
A hint?

606
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,010
The man who you saw die before your eyes.

607
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,450
The diaper chief?

608
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:14,950
Stinky.

609
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:16,310
That guy!

610
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,610
Oh my god!

611
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,430
Why me?

612
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,010
Whoa!

613
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,870
Yeah, the diaper chief.

614
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,910
I like the cat mouth.

615
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,330
That was not the diaper chief.

616
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,270
But I just said it was the diaper chief!

617
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,170
Mint, do something!

618
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,050
A member of Fox House.

619
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,010
Decoy octopus?

620
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:38,070
Easiest boss battle ever.

621
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,290
He was a master of disguise.

622
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,850
He copied his subjects down to the blood.

623
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,630
That's why he was drained of blood!

624
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:50,590
So he drained the chief's blood and took it into himself.

625
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,510
Nasty!

626
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,710
Oh my god, his face!

627
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,290
Oh my god, oh my god.

628
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,610
But he wasn't able to deceive the angel of death.

629
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,390
The angel of death?

630
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,230
What did you do with his body?

631
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:06,890
Killed him with cringe.

632
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,530
He's like, anime!

633
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,410
Anime!

634
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,930
Why go to so much trouble?

635
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,150
Why impersonate the chief?

636
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,690
Why impersonate the chief?

637
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,250
That is the end of my hint.

638
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:21,510
You must solve the rest of the riddle yourself.

639
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,530
Peculiar how...

640
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:27,730
this part's still metal.

641
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,730
In the natural world, there's no such thing as boundless slaughter.

642
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,230
There's always an end to it.

643
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,190
You are different.

644
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,090
What are you trying to say?

645
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,910
The path you walk on has no end.

646
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,610
Each step you take is paved with the corpses of your enemies.

647
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,330
Their souls will haunt you forever.

648
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,070
You shall have no peace.

649
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,090
So awesome!

650
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,090
Look at me go!

651
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,070
My spirit will be watching you.

652
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,000
They gobbled that guy up!

653
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,320
They ate him so fast.

654
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,700
Master Miller?

655
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,560
Snake, it's me.

656
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,680
Master.

657
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,080
It's about Naomi.

658
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,920
Turn the monitor off.

659
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,700
What about Naomi?

660
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,180
Colonel, is Naomi there?

661
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,700
No, she's away.

662
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,400
She's taking a short nap.

663
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,460
Oh, she must be nice.

664
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,440
I'm fighting for my life and she's napping.

665
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Okay.

666
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,700
Maybe we'd better let the Colonel hear this too.

667
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,100
I'll be watching you.

668
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,980
Subs to my channel.

669
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,780
And I'll let you know when she's gone.

670
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,700
Well, basically, Dr. Naomi Hunter is not Dr. Naomi Hunter at all.

671
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,420
What?

672
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,560
I thought her story of her background sounded kind of fishy, so I checked it out.

673
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,180
And?

674
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,540
There is an actual Dr. Naomi Hunter.

675
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,160
Or I should say, there was one.

676
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,480
But she's not the woman we know.

677
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,120
The real Naomi Hunter disappeared somewhere in the Middle East.

678
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:11,280
Our Naomi must have somehow obtained her identification papers.

679
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:11,940
Uh-oh.

680
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,720
So then who is she really?

681
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,940
She must be some kind of spy.

682
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,580
A spy.

683
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,640
Yes.

684
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,480
Maybe she's been sent to sabotage this operation.

685
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:25,480
Are you saying she's with the terrorists?

686
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
I don't want to believe it either.

687
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,520
But she is working for Foxhound.

688
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,180
So you think she had a part in the uprising?

689
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,480
Or she could be working with some different group altogether.

690
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,780
Different group.

691
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,520
It couldn't be.

692
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,480
Place her under arrest.

693
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,020
What?

694
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,660
She's betrayed us.

695
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:50,100
She needs to be arrested and interrogated to find out who she's with.

696
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,380
She's one of their spies and we're in big trouble.

697
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,300
What do you mean?

698
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,940
Nothing.

699
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,140
Have you let her in on some kind of vital secret or something?

700
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,540
Colonel!

701
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:01,620
Colonel!

702
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,080
Colonel!

703
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,480
Does this have anything to do with the mysterious deaths of the DARPA chief and the arms tech president?

704
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,700
I have no idea.

705
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,180
Colonel!

706
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,460
Anyway, we cannot allow her to participate any further in this mission.

707
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,100
Wait, wait a minute.

708
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,540
Without her, we can't complete this mission.

709
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,200
Why not?

710
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,620
You're hiding something.

711
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,120
Give me some time.

712
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,800
I'll try to get it out of her.

713
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,820
Hurry then.

714
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,540
We've got to figure out who she is and what she's doing here.

715
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,960
I understand.

716
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,340
Colonel!

717
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,020
Colonel!

718
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,100
Give me some time.

719
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,920
We're out of time!

720
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:36,820
Yeah!

721
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,620
Oh, I love that.

722
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,320
I don't have any time left for you.

723
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:41,880
It's so awesome.

724
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,100
Oh, my health is like... there's still ration and stuff over here though, right?

725
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,320
We'll just take this.

726
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,640
Let's go around and grab some stuff.

727
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,860
All good.

728
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:56,900
Oh, what's that?

729
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,980
I'm cute on my shoulders.

730
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,740
Nice.

731
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,140
Take the minigun.

732
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,440
Oh, there we go.

733
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,340
Wow.

734
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,180
No wonder he's like huffing and puffing around.

735
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,060
Oh, so good!

736
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,700
I like that there's a way to, like, look at each corpse, you know?

737
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,220
Thanks for the fine gift, Toad!

738
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,000
So, guys...

739
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,200
It was a slow process, but we gamed.

740
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,780
And now, we continue.

741
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,240
Onward.

742
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,640
What do I... how many... let's see.

743
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,840
Okay, 17 chaff grenades.

744
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,540
And we'll get more, later.

745
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,580
We'll need one for that one room coming up.

746
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,320
Oh, I forgot to say this.

747
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,120
Ah-hoo-hoo-hoo, said the crow.

748
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,560
Is that...

749
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
Is that the sound crows make?

750
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,340
Um, please, no spoilers.

751
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,620
Not for me, but for anyone who is watching that hasn't played...

752
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,000
the series before.

753
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,140
If you see a spoiler, please...

754
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,980
use to...

755
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:16,620
um...

756
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,440
get it off the screen.

757
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,820
Thank you!

758
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,580
There you go.

759
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,740
Pen.

760
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,740
Oh, right.

761
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,570
Oh, wait.

762
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,750
Thank you, Joshua!

763
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,390
Have you ever heard of God?

764
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:41,870
Yes!

765
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:42,870
The one that...

766
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,190
David Hayter is...

767
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:44,470
Yeah!

768
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,450
That plays.

769
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:45,990
I have.

770
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,270
I haven't watched it yet, though.

771
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,050
Um, this is so funny.

772
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:49,410
Okay.

773
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,710
So, like I said...

774
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:53,410
They gave me this save because, um...

775
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:55,990
Because...

776
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:56,690
Uh...

777
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,830
Obviously, this is not from the Master Collection.

778
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,590
But, um...

779
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,690
There's no Nastasha.

780
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,290
There's no Meryl.

781
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,250
There's no Meryl in here.

782
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:14,830
I don't know anything about Dr. Naomi.

783
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,570
So there's not much I can say.

784
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,270
Okay.

785
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,050
But, Snake.

786
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,530
I think you'd better leave that to Colonel Campbell.

787
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,110
Don't you think you'd better just get to the control room?

788
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:24,850
Fine.

789
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:25,390
Okay.

790
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:26,930
Master.

791
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:27,850
Mr. Miller.

792
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:28,890
Snake.

793
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:33,410
I'm sure that woman calling herself Naomi is some type of spy.

794
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:37,790
And now I'm starting to think that Campbell might be hiding something, too.

795
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,830
Don't trust him.

796
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:41,450
Oh.

797
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,730
You're making me nervous.

798
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:46,070
Check the back of the box.

799
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,870
Naomi wasn't acting strangely or anything?

800
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:48,490
No.

801
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,930
I just can't believe that Naomi is an enemy spy.

802
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,870
I refuse to accept that.

803
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,370
I don't want to believe it, either.

804
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:54,710
But...

805
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,750
Don't say it, Snake.

806
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,950
My favorite spoiler about this game is the part where the metal gears become solid.

807
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:01,710
It's so impactful.

808
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,410
Yeah.

809
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:04,130
It's a really good part, you know?

810
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,170
Save Achoo.

811
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,330
Oh.

812
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,210
She doesn't even say anything.

813
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,390
Oh.

814
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:11,490
Nothing gets said to me.

815
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,010
First time watching MJ's gameplay.

816
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,870
I didn't know the character that David Hader voices in this particular game is so cute.

817
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,970
So cute.

818
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,870
I know I won't be bored with the next about.

819
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:27,630
Wasn't it kind of surreal though?

820
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,230
Snake, if it's about Naomi, I'm looking into the matter right now.

821
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,230
We don't have time, colonel!

822
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:33,830
Where is she?

823
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:34,670
Where is she?

824
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,210
She's still sleeping.

825
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:35,530
What?

826
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,130
Wake her up!

827
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:40,030
First, the DARPA chief turns out to be an impostor and now Naomi.

828
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,370
Nastasia...

829
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:40,490
Who is this?

830
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:43,170
And the save is in L.A., just finishing up the episode.

831
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:52,430
I'm so disappointed in you, Colonel.

832
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,890
I'm so disappointed in you.

833
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:02,770
I think I got everything that I can get from this area, so let's just move onwards.

834
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,630
Level 7 now, baby!

835
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:08,990
Let's go!

836
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:13,940
Okay.

837
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,020
That's a trap.

838
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,120
Oh, look!

839
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,140
They even gave me some more!

840
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,960
Because they know that this room is just ridiculous.

841
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,640
Look at this!

842
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,760
What is going on in here?

843
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,440
Even if I shoot those down, there's more, aren't there?

844
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,420
On the other side?

845
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,820
I wonder if I can shoot them down, though.

846
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,180
Wouldn't it be kind of fun?

847
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,460
Oh, can I even... Oh, I can't even reach.

848
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,060
I'm too... I can't look out.

849
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,880
I can't look out.

850
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,740
Stinger missile?

851
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,700
Will that work?

852
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,700
No use.

853
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,360
No use.

854
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,100
Don't look at my skirt!

855
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,020
What are you doing?

856
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,640
Don't look at my skirt!

857
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,340
What are you doing?

858
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:05,440
What are you doing?

859
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,620
Oh, because I'm laid down!

860
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,320
Let's try it again.

861
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:13,800
Oh!

862
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,440
I wish I could target all of them, though.

863
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,740
But I should save these, shouldn't I?

864
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,820
Won't the cameras... be... um...

865
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,360
Won't they be re-put up later on?

866
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,680
And there's, like, a ton of them?

867
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:39,240
I'm trying to decide which would be better to use.

868
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,800
The chaff?

869
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,820
Probably just the chaff.

870
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,900
We'll save the stinger for future fight.

871
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
We'll need the chaff for future fight too.

872
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,320
You get lots of stingers, you do?

873
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,040
No, I tried sniping them already.

874
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,620
Hmm... Revolver Doki makes more sense.

875
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:07,040
Yeah, I think if we were to replace the models with people...

876
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,080
I think Matara could be Liquid Snake.

877
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,340
I think Doki would have to be Revolver Os a lot.

878
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:19,700
I was thinking maybe Henya could be Psycho Mantis.

879
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,040
Because it's... I don't know.

880
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,940
I feel like a psychic is in the same leagues as a...

881
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,020
I don't know.

882
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,020
I feel like a psychic is in the same leagues as a...

883
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,300
There's a genius, you know?

884
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,300
Revolver Doki... Henya could be Otacon.

885
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:35,900
That would... Oh!

886
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,420
I guess that works even better, right?

887
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,840
Also... I don't know in the save which ending we're going to get.

888
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,240
I originally played to get the Meryl ending.

889
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,040
I have no idea.

890
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,020
I have no idea.

891
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,800
If... So it will be gotcha.

892
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,300
Don't tell me!

893
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,220
Don't tell me!

894
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,620
Jeremy, if you're still here, don't tell me.

895
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,020
Don't tell me.

896
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:02,420
Don't tell me.

897
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,760
I want it to be a surprise.

898
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:06,760
So...

899
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,760
We will see what happens.

900
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:12,760
Okay.

901
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,160
I'm gonna...

902
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,980
Oh my god!

903
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,520
Okay, you know what?

904
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,740
There's no way I'm using this...

905
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,240
Look at this!

906
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,900
Look at all of them on the... This is... No.

907
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:21,920
No!

908
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,660
Okay, yeah.

909
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,640
Using the stinger is totally useless.

910
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,080
There's too many!

911
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,360
How do I throw?

912
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,660
Here we go!

913
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:35,800
Stinger!

914
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,210
Missile!

915
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,420
Why did they put...

916
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,540
It's almost done.

917
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,380
I'm so excited here.

918
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,980
I'm turning the volume up.

919
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,740
Are you guys ready?

920
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,020
Are you guys ready?

921
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,980
Starts with a Z.

922
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,700
Are you running this mod on actual hardware, Minto?

923
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,380
I just feel like you'd be the person to get a Japanese PS1 to play this.

924
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,040
I'm not gonna lie.

925
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,840
I 100% thought about it, but I did not have time to set it up.

926
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,920
But I did... I did really want to.

927
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:27,660
Alright, here we go.

928
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:40,720
Rex!

929
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,140
Rex!

930
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,960
Take that for sure.

931
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,540
Oh, there's a camera there.

932
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,680
Keep

933
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,340
moving.

934
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,660
Ah!

935
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,080
Not this way!

936
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,980
Move the other way!

937
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,840
Oh, I don't think it goes anymore.

938
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:18,540
Okay, that's fine.

939
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,900
We'll have to go down there anyway later on.

940
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,640
Hello?

941
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,280
Otacon!

942
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
Oh no!

943
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,800
Looks like they've finished getting Metal Gear ready.

944
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,280
Oh no!

945
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:42,940
How do you know that?

946
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,500
I overheard them talking.

947
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:44,780
Oh no!

948
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:45,940
Where are you now?

949
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,640
Right in front of Metal Gear, but it's strange.

950
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,780
What is?

951
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
There's nobody here.

952
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,340
No guards.

953
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,560
Nobody patrolling.

954
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,200
It's too quiet.

955
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,440
Maybe because they're all ready.

956
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,100
They said they even input the PAL cards.

957
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:00,940
No!

958
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:01,700
What should I do?

959
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,920
All we can do is use the override system that President Baker told you about.

960
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:06,560
Okay, okay.

961
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,380
But I've only got one of the three keys.

962
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,940
And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys.

963
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,240
Leave it to me.

964
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,880
You got some kind of plan?

965
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,600
Well, I'm in the computer room right now.

966
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,200
I'm trying to access Baker's private files.

967
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,660
Baker's files?

968
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,160
Don't you need a password?

969
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,680
Of course, but there are ways.

970
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,340
He's hacking?

971
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,700
Are you a hacker?

972
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,360
Yup, that describes me pretty well.

973
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
Does it look like you can get in?

974
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,880
Are you a hacker?

975
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:34,360
Give it a try.

976
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,020
I'm counting on you.

977
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,340
Oh, don't look up my skirt, please.

978
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,340
Oh, I don't remember where the guards are around here.

979
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,360
They're upstairs, right?

980
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:56,700
Wow!

981
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:01,840
Who

982
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,140
keeps calling me?

983
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,540
Snake, it's me again.

984
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:10,940
Noticon!

985
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,140
How's it going?

986
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:13,740
Not bad.

987
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,480
I just got past his third security level.

988
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:16,900
That was fast.

989
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,160
He was a pretty careful guy.

990
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,280
Do you think you'll break in soon?

991
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,660
Why don't you guys just stay on the phone?

992
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,800
I never had a system I couldn't bust into.

993
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:23,640
Okay.

994
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,820
Keep trying.

995
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,020
Yum.

996
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:27,740
Alright, here we go.

997
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:28,860
Don't look.

998
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:29,760
Stop!

999
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,190
Oh, there's some stuff.

1000
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,790
I'll go grab all that.

1001
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:53,410
Famous.

1002
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:00,110
Greetings, Germany.

1003
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:02,130
Second time watching VTuber.

1004
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,650
My viewer passed away from Animal.

1005
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:09,790
Money goes towards Save the Frames, Krill, the DARPA Chief, or Bustin.

1006
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:12,030
Can I get a hype?

1007
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:16,650
Hype.

1008
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:19,050
Hype.

1009
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:20,930
Hype, hype, hype.

1010
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:29,210
Passed away from Animal.

1011
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,070
I'm so sorry for your loss.

1012
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,390
Oh.

1013
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:37,370
Oh, my gosh, wait.

1014
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,710
We haven't seen me kick.

1015
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:39,630
Wow!

1016
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:42,770
Nice.

1017
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:45,250
That's a completely responsible parent.

1018
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,990
I am so proud of my boy.

1019
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,810
Doesn't he call me here?

1020
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:52,310
Yep.

1021
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:56,730
He did it!

1022
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:00,730
What do you got?

1023
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,250
What?

1024
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:22,810
Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead is designed to be fired from the railgun like a projectile.

1025
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:23,190
Okay.

1026
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,490
It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't considered a missile.

1027
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,350
This is craziness!

1028
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:29,330
That way it can get around all sorts of international treaties.

1029
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:29,910
Uh-oh.

1030
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:30,790
Pretty sneaky.

1031
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:32,470
Yes, but effective.

1032
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:33,590
Effective?

1033
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,450
And that's not even the scariest thing about this weapon.

1034
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:36,370
Uh-oh.

1035
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:37,290
I can't wait to hear this.

1036
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:39,350
It's a stealth weapon.

1037
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:41,810
You mean it won't show up on radar?

1038
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:42,630
That's crazy!

1039
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,650
The truth is they've been working on a stealth missile since the late 70s.

1040
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:46,930
Uh-oh.

1041
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,130
Why weren't they able to develop one until now?

1042
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,330
Because of the missile rocket propulsion system, it would be picked up by enemy satellites.

1043
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:54,230
But this toward... towards runner's mitt.

1044
00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:54,650
Oh, yeah.

1045
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,670
That makes sense.

1046
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:02,690
But unlike a missile, the railgun doesn't burn any propellant, so it can't be detected by any current ballistic missile detection systems.

1047
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:05,010
An invisible nuclear warhead...

1048
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:05,850
That's so scary.

1049
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:07,410
...can be impossible to intercept.

1050
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:08,250
That's so scary.

1051
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:14,010
And on top of that, it's got a surface-piercing warhead designed to penetrate hardened underground bases.

1052
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:14,650
Oh, my God.

1053
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,770
They just were like, let's take everything by...

1054
00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:19,230
This thing could mean the end of the world.

1055
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,970
It's the ultimate weapon.

1056
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:21,850
The ultimate weapon.

1057
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:26,470
And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections.

1058
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:28,850
Colonel, is this true?

1059
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:29,910
Are you listening?

1060
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:30,670
Uh, Colonel?

1061
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:32,710
I'm listening.

1062
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,250
Ugh.

1063
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:38,990
If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Star III Treaty and cause a huge international incident.

1064
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:41,110
Yeah, it would be nasty.

1065
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:41,870
Nasty.

1066
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,910
The United States would be denounced by the UN.

1067
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:44,630
It would be...

1068
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:46,150
It could even bring the President down.

1069
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:47,870
Did you know this, Colonel?

1070
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:49,450
I'm sorry.

1071
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:50,250
Oh, Colonel.

1072
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,330
You've changed, Colonel.

1073
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:52,230
You've changed, Colonel.

1074
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,590
I won't make any excuses.

1075
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,730
Snake, listen to me.

1076
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,890
This new nuclear weapon, it's never actually been tested.

1077
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:01,310
Only simulated.

1078
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,810
What if it, like, broke apart the minute, like, they tried to shoot?

1079
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:05,170
Yeah.

1080
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:06,950
That's why they were conducting this exercise.

1081
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,710
The... the missile.

1082
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:09,710
They needed to get actual experimental data to back up the simulation.

1083
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:10,830
They don't even know if it works.

1084
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,470
What were the results of the exercise?

1085
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:14,610
It looked like it was a nuclear bomb.

1086
00:47:14,610 --> 00:47:15,770
It looks like it went better than they hoped for.

1087
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,370
It was put together by the...

1088
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:20,030
I can't find the data anywhere on this network.

1089
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:23,610
You'd think the data, as important as that, would be carefully recorded.

1090
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:24,450
It was.

1091
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,610
Just don't sit by the exit seat.

1092
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:27,410
President Baker gave me an optical disc with all the test data.

1093
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:27,870
Hello from Scotland.

1094
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:28,310
What?

1095
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,650
I hope you prevent World War III and neutralize like a steak.

1096
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:31,270
Do you still have it?

1097
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,470
No.

1098
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,270
Ocelot took it from me.

1099
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,950
Thank you.

1100
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,710
The terrorists have replaced the dummy warhead with a real warhead.

1101
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,750
Once they input the detonation codes, they should be ready to launch.

1102
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,550
So you think they can do it?

1103
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:49,110
Well, the dummy warhead was designed to be identical to the real thing, so I think so.

1104
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:49,790
Ice Monkey is a better person than you?

1105
00:47:49,790 --> 00:47:51,610
Did you find out how to override it yet?

1106
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:52,490
Not yet.

1107
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:54,430
It must be in a separate file.

1108
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:57,570
Right now, I'm looking through all of Baker's personal files.

1109
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,050
Warheads from Teemu?

1110
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,250
Oh, my God.

1111
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:03,770
No, I'm warheads from Teemu.

1112
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,570
Okay, so he's like over...

1113
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:12,950
Oh, my God.

1114
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:13,730
Oh, my God.

1115
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:13,890
Oh, my God.

1116
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:14,070
Oh, my God.

1117
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:14,170
Oh, my God.

1118
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:14,790
Oh, my God.

1119
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,170
There he is.

1120
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:17,150
How can I get his butt?

1121
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,990
Gosh, I wish there was first person... first person choosing.

1122
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:32,580
I don't remember what his... what his route is like.

1123
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,000
Let's see.

1124
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,540
I think he only goes...

1125
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:34,980
Oh, hi!

1126
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:35,820
You don't see me?

1127
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,760
This guy gives this guy some glasses.

1128
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,800
I could technically maybe go now.

1129
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,480
How long does he stay over there?

1130
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:50,020
How long is he over there for?

1131
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,320
Nikita for a challenge?

1132
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,940
I'm just gonna launch a Nikita missile at this poor dude?

1133
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,320
He's over there for a while.

1134
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,840
Does he come over here?

1135
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,600
I don't think so.

1136
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,420
Do it now.

1137
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,500
The Nikita missile?

1138
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,820
Will it even let me?

1139
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:14,300
No use!

1140
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:16,380
It won't let me.

1141
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,580
Wait, what about a stinger though?

1142
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,000
No way!

1143
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,060
Wait.

1144
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,680
You're not coming this way, are you?

1145
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,600
Okay, he stops right there.

1146
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:41,580
Hey buddy!

1147
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,960
I just saved your life.

1148
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,540
I just saved your life, man!

1149
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:55,120
Can they still hear my footsteps if I'm in the box?

1150
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,400
Zoom!

1151
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,140
Can you snipe them?

1152
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,980
Oh, maybe.

1153
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:05,440
Actually, I don't think so, cause I'll lay down and it'll be like, all annoying.

1154
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:11,470
Did he hear me?

1155
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah?

1156
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,740
I'm kinda busy!

1157
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,200
He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?

1158
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,480
Arms tech is in much worse financial trouble than I thought.

1159
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,880
I know they lost their bid to make the next generation fighter jet.

1160
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,140
That plus the reduction in SDI spending...

1161
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,080
How's the audio, by the way?

1162
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,400
It's kind of hard for me to gauge.

1163
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:42,240
So I'm really sorry if it's kind of off.

1164
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,580
Or too loud, or too whatever.

1165
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,080
And it looks like we were paying a lot of bribe money to the DARPA chief.

1166
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,620
Bribe money, huh?

1167
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:48,900
It's good?

1168
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:49,720
Okay, thank you guys.

1169
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,720
And Baker was a big proponent of the nuclear deterrent theory.

1170
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:53,640
I see.

1171
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,140
Slightly quiet.

1172
00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:55,920
What about this?

1173
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:56,200
This is the override.

1174
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,320
Just give me a little bit longer.

1175
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,000
I feel like the music is kinda loud, which is why I...

1176
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,760
Oh, he's coming back.

1177
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,780
We'll stay right here.

1178
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:14,720
Oh.

1179
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,160
Just a box.

1180
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,400
Just a box.

1181
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,660
Wait, where are you going?

1182
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,060
No, no you're not.

1183
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,460
Get out of the way!

1184
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,100
Are you serious right... oh.

1185
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,480
Are you serious right now?

1186
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:33,480
Uh...

1187
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,280
Which was CQC?

1188
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:38,540
Oh wait.

1189
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:53,290
I'm hidden?

1190
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,190
I'm hiding?

1191
00:51:54,530 --> 00:51:58,110
Okay, I've entered the PAL codes and disengaged the safety device.

1192
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,030
Oh, they're blurry.

1193
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,030
Whoa!

1194
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:03,130
Whoa, they're so blurry.

1195
00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:06,210
It looks like we'll have to show them that we mean business.

1196
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,910
Should I set it for Cherniton, Russia?

1197
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:09,810
Should I set it for Cherniton, Russia?

1198
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:10,570
No.

1199
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,130
There's been a change.

1200
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:14,890
The new target is Lopnor, China.

1201
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:16,270
Why, boss?

1202
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:17,310
Look, he can see my hand!

1203
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,090
Come on, Mito, your sleeves!

1204
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:23,170
Mr. Golukovich would really like to see a nuclear bomb dropped on your motherland, right?

1205
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,210
Liquid.

1206
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:25,570
But why?

1207
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,050
There's nothing there.

1208
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,250
Wrong.

1209
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,170
It's a nuclear test site.

1210
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:30,770
Wrong.

1211
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,690
It's a nuclear test site.

1212
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:35,310
If we nuke a major population center, the game's over.

1213
00:52:35,310 --> 00:52:36,110
Is that solid, Mito?

1214
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,010
But a nuclear explosion at the test site can still be concealed from the public.

1215
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:44,670
Meanwhile, Washington will be worried about the retaliatory strike from China.

1216
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,650
That'll probably mean top-secret talks between both countries' leaders.

1217
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:49,490
Not top-secret.

1218
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:53,670
And in the process, the President will be forced to divulge the existence of...

1219
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,470
Never without being subscribed!

1220
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:57,670
...a new and highly destabilizing nuclear weapon to the Chinese.

1221
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,910
What do you think that will do to the U.S.'s reputation?

1222
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:02,990
You don't wanna subscribe to me?

1223
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:04,030
By your side?

1224
00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:13,710
And you're not chat, if you're...

1225
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:20,890
You don't have to subscribe if you don't want to.

1226
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:27,430
Big boss's DNA and one billion dollars.

1227
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:28,870
One billion dollars.

1228
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:33,330
That money will be used to cure our genome soldiers as well.

1229
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,550
I'm also including the FOXDIE vaccine in our demands.

1230
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:37,510
FOXDIE.

1231
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:39,230
FOXDIE.

1232
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:41,390
It killed Octopus in the arms tech president.

1233
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,010
So it's true that it affects older people first.

1234
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:49,710
Mantis might not have been affected because he wore a mask.

1235
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:50,890
Mask up, everybody.

1236
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:52,590
Wolf wasn't infected either.

1237
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,490
Because she's too hot to die.

1238
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,230
Oh, never mind.

1239
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:58,730
Something to do with the adrenaline levels.

1240
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:01,430
I could not chat.

1241
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:07,590
Or maybe it's just because this FOXDIE was still experimental and they haven't worked out all the bugs yet.

1242
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:09,850
I was just kidding, but thank you.

1243
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:16,150
In any case, have you heard from your friend, Colonel Sergei Golukovich, at the Spetsnaz?

1244
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:17,330
Oh, Golukovich.

1245
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,270
He still has doubts about the ability of Metal Gear.

1246
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,050
He said we can talk after Metal Gear's test launch is successful.

1247
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1248
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,250
I don't blame him.

1249
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,910
He's a very prudent man.

1250
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:28,850
I don't blame him.

1251
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:30,590
There's nothing to worry about.

1252
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:35,490
The Colonel wants Metal Gear and a new nuclear weapon so bad he can taste it.

1253
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:42,630
If Russia wants to regain its position as a military superpower, they need to reinforce their nuclear arsenal.

1254
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,750
They need a nuclear weapon that can't be intercepted.

1255
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:51,010
Metal Gear will allow them to gain first-strike capability over the rest of the world.

1256
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:56,910
Their regular army is in shambles, and they think they can restore their country's military power with nuclear weapons?

1257
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,330
Golukovich.

1258
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:59,570
He's no warrior.

1259
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:00,890
He's a politician.

1260
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,010
He's a politician.

1261
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,010
But he's the one who gave us the Hind and most of our other heavy firepower.

1262
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,130
He's got over a thousand soldiers under his command.

1263
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:12,710
If we join forces, we could put up quite a resistance here.

1264
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:13,690
Yeah, Rex is pretty cute.

1265
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,950
Since Mantis died, the Genome Soldier's brainwashing has started to wear off.

1266
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,750
I'm worried about the man's morale.

1267
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:22,170
An alliance with the Russians would boost that as well.

1268
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,370
What are you saying?

1269
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:24,990
We're not going anywhere.

1270
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:26,830
We're going to dig in here.

1271
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:27,350
Okay.

1272
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,210
You can still escape.

1273
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:34,150
We've got the most powerful weapon ever made, and we're about to ally with Golukovich's forces.

1274
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:36,030
Are you going to fight the whole world?

1275
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:36,850
I like liquid spaghetti hair.

1276
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,290
And what's wrong with that?

1277
00:55:38,430 --> 00:55:41,670
We can launch a nuclear warhead at any target on this planet.

1278
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,430
A nuclear warhead invisible to radar.

1279
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,710
And on top of that, this base is full of spare nuclear warheads.

1280
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:50,370
Once we get the DNA and the money, the world will be ours.

1281
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:51,870
We've got everything we need here.

1282
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,190
We can eat the nuclear warheads.

1283
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,510
What about your promise to Colonel Golukovich?

1284
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,270
I'll fly to Japan.

1285
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,870
I have no interest in the revival of Mother Russia.

1286
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,750
You're not thinking of reviving Big Boss's dream.

1287
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:06,730
From today, call this place Outer Heaven.

1288
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,410
Big Boss's dream.

1289
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:12,830
Mito looks at the camera.

1290
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,750
You're not worried about the POW being overridden.

1291
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:16,550
Big Boss's dream.

1292
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,250
If the code is in it again, it'll be deactivated.

1293
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,330
No need to worry.

1294
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,430
Wait, that's not me.

1295
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:24,130
We're not both dead.

1296
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:26,910
Does Snake know how the override system works?

1297
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:27,430
That's not me.

1298
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:29,070
You interrogated him, don't you know?

1299
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,750
He didn't have any keys on him.

1300
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:32,070
Good.

1301
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:34,730
Then no one can stop Metal Gear now.

1302
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,450
By the way, what should we do with that woman?

1303
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,310
Want me to kill her?

1304
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:40,890
Oh, wait.

1305
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:41,430
Let her live.

1306
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:44,330
She's Campbell's niece, and Snake cares for her.

1307
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:44,890
Wait, so she's alive?

1308
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:47,090
We'll keep her as our ace in the hole.

1309
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:47,890
Or maybe we don't.

1310
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:48,270
Beryl.

1311
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:49,510
She's alive.

1312
00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:50,390
She's alive.

1313
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:53,050
Beep, beep.

1314
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:55,670
The fourth wall is struggling.

1315
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,670
Snake, I found Baker's top secret files.

1316
00:57:00,670 --> 00:57:00,970
Let's go.

1317
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:01,910
Great job.

1318
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,250
How's it going there?

1319
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,390
They've finished inputting the PAL codes.

1320
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:05,950
Oh my god.

1321
00:57:06,210 --> 00:57:07,670
So how do we deactivate them?

1322
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:08,470
Okay.

1323
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:15,150
You see, the override system that the President was talking about, it can also be used to input the detonation codes.

1324
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:15,750
Okay.

1325
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:21,070
You see, if you insert the keys when the warhead is active, you deactivate it.

1326
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:21,450
Okay.

1327
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:24,490
And if you insert them when it's inactive, it becomes activated.

1328
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:25,170
Okay.

1329
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:27,110
And you can only use the keys once.

1330
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:28,030
Okay.

1331
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:28,730
Only once, huh?

1332
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:29,630
Yeah.

1333
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:31,030
You better get started.

1334
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,030
We don't have much time.

1335
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,350
But it takes three keys, right?

1336
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:35,870
I've only got one of them.

1337
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:37,050
Hold on a minute.

1338
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:38,510
You see, that's the trick.

1339
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:41,390
You already have all three keys.

1340
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:42,030
Whoa.

1341
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:43,110
What are you talking about?

1342
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:46,910
The card key is made of a shape memory alloy.

1343
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:47,550
Whoa.

1344
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:48,910
Shape memory alloy.

1345
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:49,890
Shape memory alloy.

1346
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:50,230
Yes.

1347
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,350
It's a magic key.

1348
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:51,430
It's a magic key.

1349
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:53,890
It changes shape at different temperatures.

1350
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,870
The key is made out of it.

1351
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:56,110
Wow.

1352
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:57,210
This card key.

1353
00:57:57,350 --> 00:57:57,830
Yeah.

1354
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,430
What if I just warm it up between my cheeks?

1355
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,490
Do you think it'll be hot enough?

1356
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:01,590
The card key changes shape at different temperatures.

1357
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,090
So this key is actually three keys in one.

1358
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,470
Clever.

1359
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:07,430
Clever.

1360
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,350
Can you see the input terminals in the center of the control room?

1361
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:13,470
I can.

1362
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:14,410
I see them.

1363
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:17,630
Those three laptop terminals are for the emergency input.

1364
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:18,310
Okay.

1365
00:58:18,350 --> 00:58:20,070
There should be a symbol on each screen.

1366
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1367
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:21,410
Each symbol.

1368
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,290
Each symbol corresponds to a different key.

1369
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:24,750
It feels like Pokemon.

1370
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:28,790
Input the keys in order from left to right.

1371
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:29,150
Okay.

1372
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:32,770
The left one's for the room temperature key.

1373
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:33,810
See the symbol?

1374
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,330
Yeah.

1375
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:36,290
Next to that goes the low temperature key.

1376
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:36,930
Between the cheeks?

1377
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:38,750
The one on the right is the high temperature key.

1378
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,730
Yeah, like the three starters.

1379
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:40,050
Yeah.

1380
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:40,330
Okay.

1381
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,170
I got it.

1382
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:43,190
First, I change the shape of the card.

1383
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:43,410
Of course.

1384
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:44,770
And then I input them in order, right?

1385
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:45,570
That's right.

1386
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:46,010
Might be too hot.

1387
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,590
All you do is insert the card keys.

1388
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,930
We're going to melt the card key.

1389
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:51,390
After you insert the key into the module, a hard drive will pop up.

1390
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:53,770
The hard disk reads the information contained on it.

1391
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:57,510
Once you've finished with all three terminals, the code input process is complete.

1392
00:58:57,830 --> 00:58:58,930
But here's the thing.

1393
00:58:58,950 --> 00:58:59,390
What are they doing?

1394
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:01,270
You can only use the key three times.

1395
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:01,690
Okay.

1396
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,830
It's an emergency system.

1397
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:04,130
It's only meant to be used once.

1398
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,670
Wait, so then how have they used it before?

1399
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:07,490
The world is riding on that key, Snake.

1400
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:08,690
Hey, shut up.

1401
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:09,170
Ah!

1402
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:11,910
My key!

1403
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:13,230
God!

1404
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:16,910
Why would you do this to me?

1405
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,470
The key fell on the train.

1406
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:18,850
It's dead.

1407
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:19,870
Oh, my God.

1408
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:21,050
Snake!

1409
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:21,370
Snake!

1410
00:59:21,370 --> 00:59:22,310
Who made that sound effect?

1411
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,770
This is bulletproof glass.

1412
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:25,690
There's no way in.

1413
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,750
I'll enjoy watching you die.

1414
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,410
Don't lock me out, Liquid.

1415
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:34,750
Let me into your heart.

1416
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:38,130
Snake, you've got to get that key.

1417
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,050
Mint!

1418
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:40,850
You've got to get that key.

1419
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:43,430
Okay.

1420
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:45,890
Oh, my God.

1421
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:46,630
Whoa, whoa, wait.

1422
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,030
I'm just going to run.

1423
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:48,530
Wait.

1424
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:48,830
Ah!

1425
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:50,250
I'm not going to just run.

1426
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:51,170
Um...

1427
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:51,350
Oh, my God.

1428
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:52,290
Was this from before?

1429
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:52,890
Seriously?

1430
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:25,670
Bye.

1431
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,220
Yeah, dummies.

1432
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:33,560
I've got a key to get it.

1433
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:33,940
Please.

1434
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,100
Leave me alone.

1435
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,440
Is that a mod?

1436
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:38,240
Absolutely.

1437
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,120
Look at their minto eyes.

1438
01:00:47,390 --> 01:00:48,390
Nothing here.

1439
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:50,510
Wait.

1440
01:00:50,570 --> 01:00:50,870
Here it is.

1441
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:52,910
It's doing something.

1442
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,790
Pre-order bonus.

1443
01:00:55,770 --> 01:00:57,770
This is from the base game.

1444
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,830
Yeah.

1445
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,610
I've always been there, you guys.

1446
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:10,570
I like how when you look at me from the bottom up, I just look really bald underneath.

1447
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:13,870
Like my head has been shaved.

1448
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:14,290
You know?

1449
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:15,050
Wait.

1450
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:15,710
Wasn't there a way?

1451
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:16,170
Oh, right here.

1452
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:18,230
Here.

1453
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:19,990
There we go.

1454
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:21,110
All right.

1455
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,750
Let's go into some acid water.

1456
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:22,990
Water.

1457
01:01:24,890 --> 01:01:25,410
I

1458
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:32,660
don't remember where it's at.

1459
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:35,120
Nice.

1460
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,040
There's also bombs under here, aren't there?

1461
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:47,150
Wait!

1462
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,050
Oh, see, yeah, yeah.

1463
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:49,750
Nice, nice.

1464
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:53,770
How do I get... avoid that?

1465
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:55,310
Okay, nice.

1466
01:01:59,130 --> 01:01:59,650
Ration.

1467
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:04,990
Is it over here by...

1468
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:09,390
I can't remember where it's at.

1469
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,610
Taking a dip in the forbidden drink.

1470
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,570
This is VTuber bathwater.

1471
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,170
That's the card?

1472
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:24,300
Are you sure?

1473
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:25,800
Isn't that the card key?

1474
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,280
Are you sure?

1475
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:29,180
Solid Snake's greatest ally, Matterment.

1476
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,360
Are you guys sure?

1477
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:33,260
I think the dot is the card.

1478
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:34,740
But it's...

1479
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,300
But it's the Mind Detector!

1480
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:49,860
The card should show up with the Mind Detector.

1481
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,820
I'm... scared.

1482
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:00,760
Call Otacon, you're so right.

1483
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:02,940
You're so right.

1484
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,240
Otacon, I lost the key!

1485
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:10,820
I'm... I'm a moe, mate.

1486
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,620
I dropped it because I'm Dojiko.

1487
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:15,960
You need that key to do it.

1488
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:17,840
Find that key, Snake.

1489
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,180
There's no other way.

1490
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:19,600
Otacon!

1491
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,760
Call Master.

1492
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:25,640
Find that key.

1493
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,840
It fell somewhere in that drainage ditch.

1494
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,420
Use your Mind Detector.

1495
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,180
Mind Detector.

1496
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:31,940
Yes.

1497
01:03:32,180 --> 01:03:34,700
The Mind Detector works just like a metal detector.

1498
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,080
The position of the card key should show up on your radar screen.

1499
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,620
We found it!

1500
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,300
Thanks, Colonel.

1501
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:41,740
Master Miller.

1502
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,240
You lost the key?

1503
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,720
Hurry up and find it.

1504
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,620
They've already entered the detonation code.

1505
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,340
Sorry.

1506
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:54,000
The only way to stop that launch is to lock the system by re-inputting the detonation codes.

1507
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,660
If you use the Mind Detector, you should be able to find the key.

1508
01:03:57,660 --> 01:03:58,480
Even Master knows.

1509
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,800
Even if it fell into the drainage ditch.

1510
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,540
Whatever you do, find that key.

1511
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,840
He's disappointed in me.

1512
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:05,700
I'm sorry, Master.

1513
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:07,920
Loving this phantom snake mod.

1514
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,140
Stay based, good girl.

1515
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:09,900
Thank you.

1516
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,840
Thank you, thank you.

1517
01:04:12,980 --> 01:04:13,280
Okay.

1518
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:16,060
We... Oh, we got a bomb!

1519
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,440
That's not the card!

1520
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:17,780
The card key!

1521
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,260
Snake, did you find the key?

1522
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:23,260
No, I found the bomb!

1523
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,260
No, it's not here.

1524
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:24,760
Join!

1525
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:25,460
Don't be ridiculous.

1526
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:27,640
You saw it fall into the drainage ditch, didn't you?

1527
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:28,900
Thank you so much.

1528
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:29,700
The drainage ditch.

1529
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,060
Thank you.

1530
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,940
Isn't there something odd about it?

1531
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:32,480
No.

1532
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:34,620
There are a lot of big rats, though.

1533
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:35,760
That's it, Snake.

1534
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,540
A rat must have eaten it.

1535
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,140
Now who's being ridiculous?

1536
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,800
No, I'm right.

1537
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,900
There's no other possibility.

1538
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,340
Rats eat all sorts of things.

1539
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,360
There's nothing unusual about it.

1540
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,820
Why did you call me to tell the...

1541
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:50,860
What?

1542
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:52,920
The rat ate the... the key?

1543
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,160
I don't feel like I ever heard this before.

1544
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:57,560
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1545
01:04:59,280 --> 01:04:59,680
Oi!

1546
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,060
Throw it!

1547
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,200
Throw it!

1548
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:03,800
Wait, how do I get it out of my...

1549
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:04,660
Oh, there we go.

1550
01:05:05,300 --> 01:05:05,700
Oi!

1551
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,500
Oh, that was close.

1552
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,570
Mine detector!

1553
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,610
Hey, rat.

1554
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,330
Did you eat the key?

1555
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:22,730
Oh!

1556
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,410
No way.

1557
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:26,510
He's literally up there.

1558
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,370
Unless he ate a bomb.

1559
01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:30,230
Oh my god, stupid rat.

1560
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,950
Did you eat a bomb, you stupid rat?

1561
01:05:33,390 --> 01:05:34,150
Where'd he go?

1562
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:34,970
Oi.

1563
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:36,730
Little rat!

1564
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:39,490
Where'd you go with the key?

1565
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:42,870
You were here!

1566
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:44,890
Zoom.

1567
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:51,650
What?

1568
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,370
Is he... Oh, I found him!

1569
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:56,290
No, no, no, you don't crawl in there!

1570
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:57,330
Oh, shoot.

1571
01:05:58,450 --> 01:05:59,470
Oh, he's going around.

1572
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:01,510
I'm watching him.

1573
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:03,010
I'm watching him crawl through the pipes.

1574
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:08,560
Just run.

1575
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:10,500
He's down that way.

1576
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,100
Little rat.

1577
01:06:17,690 --> 01:06:18,510
Where is he?

1578
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:20,030
Is he down here?

1579
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:22,570
I think he's down here.

1580
01:06:23,630 --> 01:06:24,070
Maybe.

1581
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:24,210
Maybe.

1582
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:28,340
Wait.

1583
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,480
This is such an awesome angle!

1584
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,260
I've never seen this angle before, I don't think.

1585
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,020
Oh my gosh, it's so awesome.

1586
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:35,820
Oh, shoot.

1587
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:36,500
The rat is...

1588
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:39,920
Oh, there he is.

1589
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,850
I think I keep spooking him.

1590
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,980
I don't remember this part at all, to be honest.

1591
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,700
Is this from Integral?

1592
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,980
Is this like a special Integral thing, or...

1593
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:12,140
I don't remember.

1594
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:13,940
I don't remember.

1595
01:07:15,340 --> 01:07:18,260
Can we replace the rats with tiny Mintos?

1596
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,400
Little rat!

1597
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,380
Oh, it's random.

1598
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:24,040
No way.

1599
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:24,760
That's crazy.

1600
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:27,360
Little rat!

1601
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:33,310
You going back this way?

1602
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,190
I'll meet you there.

1603
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,370
I'm gonna put a bomb.

1604
01:07:42,770 --> 01:07:44,830
I'm gonna... I'm gonna blow up this rat.

1605
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:52,810
Wait, he left!

1606
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:57,890
Oh, he left.

1607
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:02,930
It would be funny if the rat turned out to be leading you into a colony of Zanzibar hamsters.

1608
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,810
Oh, where did he go?

1609
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:11,390
Stupid guy.

1610
01:08:13,550 --> 01:08:17,410
Okay, we need to see where he kind of hangs out, and then like...

1611
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,260
Oh, get up.

1612
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:23,240
Get up there.

1613
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,520
Oh, you stupid... You stupid...

1614
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,160
Where does he even come from here?

1615
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:32,360
I can't even tell.

1616
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,200
Has to do with how many alerts you get.

1617
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,200
Low equals right.

1618
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:38,740
Really?

1619
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,420
Does that mean I'm doing well?

1620
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:44,040
No way.

1621
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,220
No way!

1622
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,080
The other thing is that it's random, though.

1623
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:52,620
That's so awesome!

1624
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:54,300
I did well enough to get the rat!

1625
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,500
Where did he go, though?

1626
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,560
Where the hell is he?

1627
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:06,420
Why

1628
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:14,550
didn't he blow up?

1629
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:15,810
Oh,

1630
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,300
no, that's my bomb.

1631
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:30,940
I'm an idiot.

1632
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:32,100
Wait, he might blow up now.

1633
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:32,880
What?

1634
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:37,420
I got it!

1635
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:39,760
It's okay, the death happened offscreen.

1636
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,880
I'm an idiot, though.

1637
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,800
I can't believe I was like, hey, that's my...

1638
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,660
Where's the rat?

1639
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:47,780
Where's the rat?

1640
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,200
I can't see him, you guys, but...

1641
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:53,960
It's a ghost rat!

1642
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:58,780
Thank you.

1643
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,060
Thank you, Jackal Blaze.

1644
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:01,640
Thank you.

1645
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,460
I kinda wanna go get that ration.

1646
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,000
I know it's craziness, but...

1647
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:11,820
Nah, it's okay.

1648
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:13,320
I'll go without.

1649
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:13,780
I'll go without.

1650
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:13,880
I'll go without.

1651
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:16,880
I'll go without.

1652
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,060
How does it taste?

1653
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,060
Yeah, they were giving us a little...

1654
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,040
A little sneak... sneak peek of, uh...

1655
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:28,060
Of three.

1656
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,260
Guide says under ten alerts is the rat?

1657
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:35,340
There's no way I did that well.

1658
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:37,460
There's no way.

1659
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:41,200
Minto Gaming?

1660
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:44,040
Some heating or cooling pipes you can shoot?

1661
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:45,860
No.

1662
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:47,980
Binary Ghost?

1663
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:49,820
That's actually only for...

1664
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,480
That's actually only for... what's it called?

1665
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:56,000
Twin Snakes.

1666
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,640
Unfortunately, for this, we have to backtrack.

1667
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,510
I wanna get this guy's butt.

1668
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:12,110
Maybe I can get him from when he's right here.

1669
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:21,090
Because if he sees my box, he kicks me over.

1670
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:22,830
Jerk.

1671
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,010
Use the stinger?

1672
01:11:24,150 --> 01:11:25,550
Yeah, I think I will.

1673
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:29,670
I think I will stinger his face.

1674
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:32,450
Will it kill him though?

1675
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:35,450
Maybe from this close it should, right?

1676
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,170
Come on over.

1677
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:46,510
He's gonna die?

1678
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:46,930
Good.

1679
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,220
Oh, didn't you say this was a different save?

1680
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:55,300
Yeah, you're so right.

1681
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,080
No wonder.

1682
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,400
I was like, there's no way I had less than...

1683
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,520
than ten.

1684
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:10,810
That's not my fault.

1685
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:11,870
That is the stinger.

1686
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,770
That's not my fault.

1687
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:15,590
That's not my fault.

1688
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:17,670
That's not my fault!

1689
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,580
The stinger missile is broken!

1690
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,420
It's broken!

1691
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:37,920
The stinger missile is broken!

1692
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:42,800
Oh, she's so skilled, she can miss with a locked-off gun.

1693
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,920
Well, I guess no Minto gaming.

1694
01:12:47,260 --> 01:12:48,760
But Jeremy, thanks for...

1695
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:52,120
I guess, thanks whoever...

1696
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,920
I don't know actually who put together the save.

1697
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,500
But thanks for gaming so I could see the rat.

1698
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,100
Completely forgot.

1699
01:12:59,260 --> 01:13:00,440
That's not my save.

1700
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:03,240
That's so funny.

1701
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:05,140
Sigh.

1702
01:13:07,100 --> 01:13:08,960
All the guided missiles fall...

1703
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,060
It actually is though!

1704
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,060
How could I have missed?

1705
01:13:12,820 --> 01:13:13,720
There's no way!

1706
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,520
I wonder if I could snipe them from maybe down here.

1707
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:20,960
Because...

1708
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:26,380
I don't think I can look up...

1709
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:27,040
Oh, maybe I can.

1710
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,380
Where is he though?

1711
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,120
Hey mister...

1712
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,420
Oh, oh here he comes, here he comes.

1713
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:32,880
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1714
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:34,140
Oh my god.

1715
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,140
Wait, mister?

1716
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:35,240
Mister?

1717
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:36,280
Mister?

1718
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,780
Let's use this...

1719
01:13:38,780 --> 01:13:40,020
Cigarettes don't really help...

1720
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,820
So much but...

1721
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,620
Wait, oh I do have the dice as a pound.

1722
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:44,280
Nevermind.

1723
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,160
Just gonna use that.

1724
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:53,600
Yippee!

1725
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:03,750
What did he drop?

1726
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:04,430
Oh.

1727
01:14:05,670 --> 01:14:06,130
So...

1728
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,190
What's over here?

1729
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:13,500
Nothing here...

1730
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:13,920
Look it!

1731
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:14,620
Rex!

1732
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:16,980
Oh, ain't she a beaut!

1733
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:18,300
Ah, let me in.

1734
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:19,100
Wow!

1735
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,880
Look how cool she looks.

1736
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:27,720
Here we go.

1737
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:29,040
Okay.

1738
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,370
Pow-key time.

1739
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,570
Wait, I have...

1740
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,270
The gas mask.

1741
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,550
Okay.

1742
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:49,080
Don't really want to get shot at...

1743
01:14:50,260 --> 01:14:52,180
By this guy right here.

1744
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:53,740
Okay.

1745
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:02,870
Okay.

1746
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:04,470
Use the gas mask, please.

1747
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:06,470
Jeremy, stop spamming!

1748
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,670
Well, I'm gonna say it real quick.

1749
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:13,170
Hello.

1750
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:15,410
Be cute.

1751
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:16,370
That's all.

1752
01:15:24,170 --> 01:15:25,810
I'll use it when I need it.

1753
01:15:26,050 --> 01:15:27,110
What about you, Snake?

1754
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,510
Is your honor just an empty bubble, too?

1755
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:31,410
I don't know.

1756
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:32,850
I don't know.

1757
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,010
Where is it?

1758
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:42,880
What is...

1759
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,700
What have you done to me?

1760
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:56,450
Oh, my God.

1761
01:15:57,130 --> 01:15:58,830
What have you done to me?

1762
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:00,050
Wait!

1763
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:08,500
All right.

1764
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:09,840
Where's my pow-key?

1765
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:11,620
Pow-key.

1766
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:12,420
Wait.

1767
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:15,200
Just put it in.

1768
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,220
All right.

1769
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:16,360
There we go.

1770
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:21,700
What about the goggles?

1771
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:22,820
I'll check.

1772
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,260
Why is my head so tiny?

1773
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,540
Pow-code number one confirmed.

1774
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:30,660
Yay!

1775
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,240
Awaiting pow-code number two.

1776
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,680
Okay.

1777
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:40,100
That takes care of pow-code number one.

1778
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,200
Now pow-code number two, freeze the key.

1779
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,920
Freeze the key!

1780
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,320
Okay.

1781
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,260
Oh, come on!

1782
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:50,560
What happened to my thing?

1783
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:51,920
It wasn't over?

1784
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:56,380
Goggles.

1785
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,840
Oh my god, it's... Oh, I can't even see anything, though.

1786
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:02,360
It's... Oh, it's so... Oh my god, I can't see anything.

1787
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,520
It's the same, though, it looks like.

1788
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:17,260
I'm just gonna run for it.

1789
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:19,160
Oh, it didn't even get me.

1790
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:21,140
Nice.

1791
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,460
Is this guy still here?

1792
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:25,440
Is this guy back?

1793
01:17:29,060 --> 01:17:30,080
Oh my god.

1794
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,440
Oh, wait.

1795
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,600
Wrong.

1796
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,060
The body armor?

1797
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:40,200
Here, we'll check out... We'll try everything here, right?

1798
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,000
It's so funny.

1799
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:44,940
What's the body armor?

1800
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:45,700
Where is it?

1801
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:49,100
Body... I tried... I actually have the body armor.

1802
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:50,760
Wait.

1803
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:51,540
Wait.

1804
01:17:51,660 --> 01:17:53,340
My hair is green now.

1805
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,920
But it's not undoing it.

1806
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:58,120
That's so funny.

1807
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:00,380
Wait, so... But now my hair is back to normal.

1808
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,540
I've become a skinny legend.

1809
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:10,840
I've become a skinny legend!

1810
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,420
Oh my god.

1811
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,500
My eyes, please.

1812
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:16,300
Okay.

1813
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:17,780
Anyway.

1814
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:21,540
Slendermint.

1815
01:18:24,460 --> 01:18:25,100
There he is.

1816
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,580
Do you think I can shoot him again?

1817
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:28,840
From here?

1818
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:36,040
I missed him.

1819
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:37,780
Where'd you go?

1820
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,880
Why can't I find anything?

1821
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,280
I think I'm getting hungry, so...

1822
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,080
Oh, there it is.

1823
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,460
Oh my goodness.

1824
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:45,620
Choo-choo.

1825
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:46,200
Choo-choo.

1826
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,160
Choo-choo.

1827
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:47,900
Oh my god.

1828
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:48,380
Oh my god.

1829
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:49,940
Take this as a palm.

1830
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:53,900
Please!

1831
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,660
Don't move so jerkily like...

1832
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:58,180
Oh my god, please.

1833
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,320
Did he die?

1834
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:02,060
Yay!

1835
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:04,240
He did.

1836
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:14,280
Let's go freeze a key.

1837
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,390
I wish the hot one was first.

1838
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,170
To be honest.

1839
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:25,470
I wish I could go...

1840
01:19:26,070 --> 01:19:27,270
All the way to the hot...

1841
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,370
I would rather go to the hot one first, you know?

1842
01:19:29,810 --> 01:19:31,050
He got sniped.

1843
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,470
Sniped from like...

1844
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:33,690
So close.

1845
01:19:36,430 --> 01:19:36,830
Hmm...

1846
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:40,490
Use the cardboard box.

1847
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,130
I didn't know he was gonna walk over there though.

1848
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,130
Oh my goodness, my skirt.

1849
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:44,230
Oh la la.

1850
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,850
Don't look.

1851
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:46,310
How's it gonna be?

1852
01:19:49,530 --> 01:19:51,530
Yeah, I wish you could pick which key you did first as well.

1853
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:52,190
Yeah, I don't know.

1854
01:19:52,230 --> 01:19:54,390
I just don't feel like going all the way to the hot area.

1855
01:19:58,530 --> 01:19:59,450
Oh my god, my skirt.

1856
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:01,730
It's breaking a little bit.

1857
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:02,530
What?

1858
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:03,650
What's wrong with me?

1859
01:20:04,450 --> 01:20:04,770
Ah!

1860
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:06,570
I'm missing the front part of my skirt.

1861
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:06,810
Oh my god, my skirt.

1862
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:11,290
This way.

1863
01:20:13,150 --> 01:20:13,710
Uh...

1864
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:14,050
No.

1865
01:20:14,190 --> 01:20:14,810
We're fine here.

1866
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:16,390
It's the other part.

1867
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:17,710
That's the...

1868
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:19,150
Is this...

1869
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,070
Is it fine right here actually?

1870
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:22,270
Um...

1871
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:23,630
Let's get our chaff grenades ready.

1872
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:27,070
Shameless ghost!

1873
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,230
It's not me!

1874
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,850
I just realized that there's a way to go over there.

1875
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,870
Interesting.

1876
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:41,810
Okay.

1877
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:43,630
Okay.

1878
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:44,550
Let's see.

1879
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:44,730
Let me...

1880
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:46,810
My health is still fine.

1881
01:20:47,210 --> 01:20:47,910
All right.

1882
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:48,730
The PAL key.

1883
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:50,470
Oh my god.

1884
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:51,530
Oh my god.

1885
01:20:51,610 --> 01:20:52,010
Oh, I...

1886
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:53,310
Card key.

1887
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:54,370
PAL key.

1888
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:04,890
I like how the whole thing with the card key is a huge Metal Gear 2 reference.

1889
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:05,930
You know what's funny?

1890
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:08,210
Is in my short, when I was just like...

1891
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:13,530
Metal Gear Solid feels like a remake of Metal Gear 2.

1892
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:15,670
There are people who are just like...

1893
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:15,930
Um...

1894
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:16,630
No.

1895
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:18,970
Metal Gear Solid is its own thing.

1896
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:19,850
And I'm like...

1897
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:27,830
I don't think you realize that just like Metal Gear Solid 2, Metal Gear Solid 1 is also basically a remake.

1898
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:34,430
They took it so literally.

1899
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:35,890
But it is...

1900
01:21:35,890 --> 01:21:36,930
But like there's so much...

1901
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:37,370
Yeah.

1902
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:37,830
Like...

1903
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:38,150
Oh.

1904
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,010
Not yet.

1905
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,430
Not yet.

1906
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:41,630
Um...

1907
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,470
There's so much from Metal Gear.

1908
01:21:43,570 --> 01:21:43,630
Like...

1909
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:43,890
I don't know.

1910
01:21:44,130 --> 01:21:46,210
That they use in Metal Gear Solid.

1911
01:21:46,410 --> 01:21:47,470
Like it's the same format.

1912
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:48,030
And everything.

1913
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,870
But...

1914
01:21:50,950 --> 01:21:51,810
What do I know?

1915
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,310
I'm just a ghost here.

1916
01:21:56,670 --> 01:21:58,830
They've made the same game three times in a row.

1917
01:21:58,870 --> 01:21:59,470
Like actually.

1918
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:02,370
Maybe...

1919
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:03,090
You know...

1920
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:03,650
Oh.

1921
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:04,470
It's good.

1922
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:04,750
It's good.

1923
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,990
Kojima is truly a genius.

1924
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,490
You know?

1925
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:13,090
He...

1926
01:22:13,090 --> 01:22:13,390
He...

1927
01:22:13,390 --> 01:22:13,610
He...

1928
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:15,970
He can make the same game three times and it's fine.

1929
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:28,870
I'm going to use so many trap grenades here.

1930
01:22:28,990 --> 01:22:29,890
It's kind of painful.

1931
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,320
He keeps getting away with it.

1932
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,280
Are you playing as yourself?

1933
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:43,560
Yeah.

1934
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,140
I've always been in the game.

1935
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,640
You're actually in the game.

1936
01:22:54,780 --> 01:22:55,800
I'm in the game!

1937
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:01,780
I love how people are coming in and being like...

1938
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:01,980
Yo!

1939
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:09,730
Go

1940
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:14,060
up.

1941
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,660
Go up, please.

1942
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:18,860
The car...

1943
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:19,580
The pal key...

1944
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:20,140
Still good.

1945
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,320
I think it's the red one that we will have to worry about more, but...

1946
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,080
Hmm.

1947
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:30,580
Where is this guy at?

1948
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,320
I don't know where he is... where he stands.

1949
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,720
Do you think I can get him from here?

1950
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:39,780
I don't think I can though.

1951
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:43,820
Where is he at?

1952
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,300
I think I can only see his little feet from here.

1953
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:48,820
And he's gone.

1954
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:49,960
He's gone anyway.

1955
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,220
I'm just gonna run for it.

1956
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:55,520
Run!

1957
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,100
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1958
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,260
You won't see me, right?

1959
01:24:01,820 --> 01:24:02,100
Yeah.

1960
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:02,920
We're good.

1961
01:24:14,660 --> 01:24:15,580
Don't worry about it.

1962
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,400
This one.

1963
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,020
Beep, beep.

1964
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:25,820
There we go.

1965
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:26,580
Okay.

1966
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:27,960
What was that noise?

1967
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:31,900
Okay.

1968
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:40,960
Pal code number two confirmed.

1969
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,380
We're gonna save the world, you guys.

1970
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,000
We're gonna save the world.

1971
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:51,480
We're gonna stop that nuclear... Oh, it's floating.

1972
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,340
Next comes pal number three.

1973
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:54,560
Warm the key.

1974
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:55,820
Warm the key.

1975
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:56,360
Alright, Snake.

1976
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,320
Cheeks open.

1977
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,140
Open up.

1978
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,160
Do you think it's...

1979
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,500
Do you think it's... there's still a...

1980
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,120
What's it called?

1981
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,340
An alert?

1982
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,380
You think there's still an alert?

1983
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:19,360
You think we're good?

1984
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:20,720
Let's go check it out.

1985
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:28,130
We're good!

1986
01:25:28,650 --> 01:25:29,370
We're good.

1987
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:30,070
Okay.

1988
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:31,790
Let's snipe this guy.

1989
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,930
Where's my... desert pan?

1990
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:44,670
Oh, if you have a cold?

1991
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,730
That's so cute.

1992
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:46,370
Oh, where'd he go?

1993
01:25:46,730 --> 01:25:47,170
Hello?

1994
01:25:47,410 --> 01:25:47,850
Mister?

1995
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:48,710
Come back.

1996
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:50,530
Oh.

1997
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,630
I didn't take this, did I?

1998
01:25:52,770 --> 01:25:53,670
Wait, or did I?

1999
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:54,130
You know what?

2000
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:54,410
It's fine.

2001
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:55,870
I'm only gonna have to use it a couple times.

2002
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:57,890
Oh, okay.

2003
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:06,150
Double dose.

2004
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:11,350
I'm just, uh, you know... being cautious.

2005
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:13,330
I'm addicted to the meds.

2006
01:26:13,390 --> 01:26:14,790
I need my dizzy pam!

2007
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:14,910
Pam!

2008
01:26:19,810 --> 01:26:21,650
Take a dip in the Metal Gear soup.

2009
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:26,430
Wait, does that... no, wait, that doesn't work.

2010
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:27,910
That doesn't work, does it?

2011
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:30,170
I mean, it's like nuclear waste, isn't it?

2012
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:31,330
It should work.

2013
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:33,410
Shouldn't it?

2014
01:26:33,850 --> 01:26:34,510
Shouldn't it work?

2015
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:46,550
Oh, I went the wrong way.

2016
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:47,170
Oh, that's fine.

2017
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:48,470
Got some more bullets.

2018
01:26:50,290 --> 01:26:51,490
Metal Gear acid.

2019
01:26:55,370 --> 01:26:57,290
Give me a spoon, I'll test it.

2020
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,460
Alright, this way.

2021
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,360
I'm actually curious.

2022
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,380
But I don't wanna, like...

2023
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:16,040
Just got here and I got jumpscared by seeing VinceFGS be real?

2024
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:16,620
Holy shit.

2025
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:23,380
I don't think it works.

2026
01:27:25,780 --> 01:27:26,620
That's me, baby.

2027
01:27:26,780 --> 01:27:27,920
That's me in the game.

2028
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,880
That's me killing Vulcan Raven one shot.

2029
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,320
I mean, not one shot.

2030
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:36,240
One first try.

2031
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:40,020
Oh, I do that every time.

2032
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,060
It'll still work though, right?

2033
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:43,240
Please work.

2034
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:43,620
Okay.

2035
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,400
I just threw it down into the ground!

2036
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:49,620
Oh, I ended up...

2037
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:51,340
Alrighty.

2038
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:53,880
Let's go.

2039
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,360
Let's go back to...

2040
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,060
Oh my god, I forgot there's guys here now!

2041
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,160
Oh my god, sorry.

2042
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:02,720
It scared me so much.

2043
01:28:02,900 --> 01:28:04,940
Wait, I forgot there's guys here now!

2044
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:05,640
No way.

2045
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:10,380
No, my, my, my, my, my little walk.

2046
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:13,500
My walk in the park.

2047
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:15,140
No!

2048
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,120
Okay.

2049
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,180
Um...

2050
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,620
I have to remember...

2051
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:22,220
Okay.

2052
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:24,180
He doesn't see me.

2053
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:25,920
Oh my god.

2054
01:28:26,020 --> 01:28:27,080
Why are there so many guys here?

2055
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,020
What the hell?

2056
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:33,000
Which way did they go?

2057
01:28:33,120 --> 01:28:33,340
Okay.

2058
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:57,940
I'm not in your way.

2059
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,520
I'm not in your...

2060
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,540
I was not in your way.

2061
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:11,340
I was so out of your way!

2062
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,180
You don't have to be like this to be...

2063
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,560
You don't have to be like this to me, man.

2064
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:20,720
Luckily, I was just by the door.

2065
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:22,380
So it all worked out.

2066
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,240
I will take this ration.

2067
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:28,440
I will take this one.

2068
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:30,460
Just the becks.

2069
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:40,570
He went out of his way to be in your way.

2070
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:41,130
I know, right?

2071
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,110
It doesn't... It's so unfair!

2072
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:46,770
I feel like they pick on me for no reason.

2073
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,630
They pick on me.

2074
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,670
Hey crows, come here.

2075
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:53,310
I'm gonna punch you.

2076
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:54,330
Come here.

2077
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,640
I punched him!

2078
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,480
Stream?

2079
01:30:13,550 --> 01:30:14,690
It's not on my end.

2080
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:15,250
Wait.

2081
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:16,590
Are we good?

2082
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:22,580
Are we good?

2083
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:25,180
Oh, we're back.

2084
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:25,480
We're back.

2085
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:25,740
Okay.

2086
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:25,980
Okay.

2087
01:30:25,980 --> 01:30:26,120
Okay.

2088
01:30:26,180 --> 01:30:26,720
It scared me.

2089
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,200
It scared me.

2090
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:29,000
I was about to type in the chat like, hello?

2091
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:37,720
Hot!

2092
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:41,300
Okay, Campbell.

2093
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:43,620
I'm right here.

2094
01:30:51,560 --> 01:30:53,320
Why do they all say, hot?

2095
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:56,280
How does Otacon say it?

2096
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,720
What about the blast furnace?

2097
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:06,720
But the problem is, if you go through a cold place on the way back, the card key might change shape.

2098
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:08,800
You need to hurry on the way back.

2099
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:09,480
Okay.

2100
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:12,100
That key is actually an IC card.

2101
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:15,920
It's connector pins and main body are made of a shape memory alloy.

2102
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:24,380
It's designed so that unless it's been changed to the correct shape, it won't be recognized by the PAL code input terminal in the control room.

2103
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,460
And the detonation code won't be entered.

2104
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:28,560
Okay.

2105
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:30,020
I'll do my best.

2106
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:31,420
I am going to save though.

2107
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:32,760
Real quick.

2108
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:35,160
What can I do for you, Snake?

2109
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:36,640
Save.

2110
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:37,580
Sorry.

2111
01:31:38,380 --> 01:31:39,640
Save and save.

2112
01:31:43,940 --> 01:31:44,400
Snake.

2113
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:45,740
Come what come may.

2114
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:48,520
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

2115
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:50,460
We're almost out of time, Snake.

2116
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:50,900
I know.

2117
01:31:51,020 --> 01:31:51,580
Please hurry.

2118
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:54,500
You're the only one who can stop them from launching that nuke.

2119
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,120
I'm going.

2120
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:55,540
I'm going.

2121
01:31:56,300 --> 01:31:57,320
I'm going for you.

2122
01:31:57,720 --> 01:31:58,200
For you.

2123
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:58,540
For you, girl.

2124
01:32:00,340 --> 01:32:00,760
Oh.

2125
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:03,370
Hello?

2126
01:32:05,210 --> 01:32:05,630
Oh.

2127
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:05,710
Snake.

2128
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:07,630
It's about Naomi Hunter.

2129
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:08,050
Faster.

2130
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,430
Then you should talk to the colonel.

2131
01:32:09,550 --> 01:32:10,410
He's looking into it.

2132
01:32:10,410 --> 01:32:11,230
Miller, go shoot in someone.

2133
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:12,190
Turn your monitor off.

2134
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,770
Okay.

2135
01:32:13,890 --> 01:32:14,290
It's off.

2136
01:32:14,590 --> 01:32:15,890
No one else can hear us.

2137
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:16,250
Go ahead.

2138
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,270
Sorry.

2139
01:32:17,390 --> 01:32:19,530
But I didn't want the colonel to hear.

2140
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:20,290
Okay.

2141
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:20,830
So what's up?

2142
01:32:20,830 --> 01:32:22,590
Are you going to whisper sweet nothings into my ear?

2143
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:23,490
I've got a good friend in the Pentagon.

2144
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:24,470
Yeah?

2145
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:26,790
He's the one who told me about it.

2146
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:27,270
Okay.

2147
01:32:27,290 --> 01:32:29,930
It looks like the DIA recently developed an IC card.

2148
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:32,410
It's a new type of assassination weapon.

2149
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:34,450
An assassination weapon?

2150
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:39,110
Snake, have you ever heard of something called Fox Dye?

2151
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:41,350
Fox Dye.

2152
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:41,710
No.

2153
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:42,270
Fox Dye.

2154
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:44,390
Liquid and the others were talking about it.

2155
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:44,710
Yeah.

2156
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:45,110
No.

2157
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:48,750
It's some kind of virus that targets specific people.

2158
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:53,110
I don't know all the details, but what are you trying to say?

2159
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:54,150
Yeah, what are you trying to say, huh?

2160
01:32:54,530 --> 01:32:55,950
It's too similar.

2161
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:57,210
What is?

2162
01:32:57,890 --> 01:32:59,230
The cause of death.

2163
01:32:59,450 --> 01:32:59,930
What's the cause of death?

2164
01:32:59,930 --> 01:33:07,830
Didn't the arms tech president and the DARPA chief, I mean, decoy octopus, die of something that looked like a heart attack?

2165
01:33:08,290 --> 01:33:08,890
Yeah.

2166
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:16,110
Well, apparently, Fox Dye kills its victims by simulating a heart attack.

2167
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:16,910
What?

2168
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:17,930
No.

2169
01:33:18,270 --> 01:33:20,670
You're telling me that Naomi was behind it?

2170
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:21,150
No.

2171
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:23,230
Snake, try to remember.

2172
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:26,390
Did Naomi give you some kind of injection?

2173
01:33:27,810 --> 01:33:28,410
Nanomachines.

2174
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:29,910
She was in the business.

2175
01:33:29,930 --> 01:33:33,570
She was in the best position to have done it, but I don't know what her motive was.

2176
01:33:33,790 --> 01:33:34,630
Does the Colonel know?

2177
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:35,270
Guys, I think I'm in trouble.

2178
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:36,010
I'm not sure.

2179
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:38,270
But he still hasn't questioned her.

2180
01:33:38,570 --> 01:33:39,050
Okay.

2181
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:39,610
I'll ask him myself.

2182
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,550
I feel the Fox Dye flowing through me.

2183
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:44,330
Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation?

2184
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:47,070
I just placed Naomi under arrest.

2185
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:48,010
Arrest?

2186
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:51,330
She was sending coded messages towards the Alaskan base.

2187
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:55,250
I didn't want to believe it, but she must be working with the terrorists.

2188
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:56,550
Are you sure?

2189
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:57,850
I'm afraid so.

2190
01:33:58,210 --> 01:33:59,730
She's being interrogated now.

2191
01:33:59,810 --> 01:33:59,910
Are you sure?

2192
01:33:59,910 --> 01:34:00,150
Yeah.

2193
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:01,250
Get her ass.

2194
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:02,010
What kind of interrogation?

2195
01:34:02,310 --> 01:34:06,530
Well, I'd like to avoid the rough stuff, but we don't even have any...

2196
01:34:06,530 --> 01:34:06,650
Punch her.

2197
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:07,290
Punch her.

2198
01:34:08,030 --> 01:34:09,670
Call me if you find out anything.

2199
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:10,750
Cut off her tongue.

2200
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,910
So it's true, isn't it?

2201
01:34:12,290 --> 01:34:12,770
Naomi...

2202
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:13,190
Wait.

2203
01:34:13,190 --> 01:34:14,150
Then she can't tell us anything.

2204
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:14,630
I can't believe it.

2205
01:34:14,830 --> 01:34:18,730
That means the Fox Dye vaccine must be around somewhere.

2206
01:34:18,950 --> 01:34:19,230
Somewhere.

2207
01:34:19,230 --> 01:34:21,470
Listen, I've got bigger things to worry about.

2208
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:24,950
But, Snake, you might be infected too, you know?

2209
01:34:25,110 --> 01:34:26,310
All I can do...

2210
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,450
I think I'm fine.

2211
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:27,810
...is leave it up to the Colonel.

2212
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:29,890
I think I'm fine.

2213
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,710
I'm probably fine.

2214
01:34:32,150 --> 01:34:33,110
I'm probably okay.

2215
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,050
I'm curious.

2216
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:40,970
How fast do I have to go from the hot area to the cold... to the... like... you know, like...

2217
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:41,970
Oh, look at that.

2218
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:47,890
Carrier, boy.

2219
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:54,540
I think there's a bomb over there, right?

2220
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,480
And then there's...

2221
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:56,800
Ah!

2222
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:57,300
What?

2223
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,280
I'm in here!

2224
01:34:58,700 --> 01:34:59,560
Are you kidding me?

2225
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:00,400
I haven't even moved.

2226
01:35:02,780 --> 01:35:03,440
I'm going to...

2227
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,680
I'm going to blow this thing up.

2228
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:06,440
I'm going to...

2229
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:07,780
I'm going to blow this thing up.

2230
01:35:14,230 --> 01:35:15,010
Take it out!

2231
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:15,910
Okay.

2232
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:24,570
If I'm really careful...

2233
01:35:24,570 --> 01:35:25,250
Oh, come on.

2234
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:25,970
I don't even need it.

2235
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:30,010
There was nothing else in here, though, right?

2236
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:30,850
Okay, good.

2237
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:32,170
All righty.

2238
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:35,030
To the heat.

2239
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:37,870
Stop taking injections from random women.

2240
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:38,770
She was...

2241
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:40,570
She was sexy.

2242
01:35:42,090 --> 01:35:43,570
The game gives you plenty of time.

2243
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:44,210
Okay, cool.

2244
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:45,710
Okay, cool.

2245
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:45,790
Okay, cool.

2246
01:35:49,940 --> 01:35:50,320
Okay, cool.

2247
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:52,320
And we're back!

2248
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:53,720
We got all...

2249
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,680
Look at the deep darkness.

2250
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:59,280
It's pretty spooky down there.

2251
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:02,820
She was okay.

2252
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,100
Dang.

2253
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,960
PP Paladin has some high standards.

2254
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:11,300
I think Naomi is quite attractive.

2255
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:14,380
It's just her personality that really makes it...

2256
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:18,080
Just really ruins it, you know?

2257
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:20,320
Otherwise, I think she's okay.

2258
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:22,400
She's a... fine looking gal.

2259
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:26,300
It's just... when she opens her mouth, I'm like...

2260
01:36:26,300 --> 01:36:26,680
Okay.

2261
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:28,420
You can stop now.

2262
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,260
That's all.

2263
01:36:33,980 --> 01:36:35,580
Mei Ling is so gorgeous.

2264
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,140
Mei Ling is perfect.

2265
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:42,340
Nothing can... I'm not saying... it's not like... you know...

2266
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,320
I'm saying Mei Ling is prettier than...

2267
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,320
Than... I'm not saying Naomi is prettier than Mei Ling or anything.

2268
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:52,860
I'm just saying that...

2269
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,320
I'm just saying...

2270
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,600
That Naomi is good looking.

2271
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,260
But Mei Ling is definitely, you know...

2272
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:07,920
Can I go in here?

2273
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:13,110
Alright, we're just gonna chill in here for now.

2274
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:16,190
If I get caught by the steam...

2275
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:22,930
If I get... If I walk into the steam, that surely should heat it up more.

2276
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:34,140
I see Naomi and... I've seen the Mei Ling 3D model, but actually I don't think I've seen the Naomi one.

2277
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:41,080
Technically not wrong.

2278
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:42,780
Put your hands in the steam.

2279
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:00,760
Look, there's an item there.

2280
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,640
It's probably more bullets that I don't need.

2281
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,080
Is that solid mint?

2282
01:38:11,060 --> 01:38:11,540
Mei...

2283
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,280
I'm gonna let it... I'm gonna let it simmer a little bit more.

2284
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:18,620
I can fix her.

2285
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:23,080
Just a little bit more.

2286
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,100
It's gotta be peak... It's gotta be peak.

2287
01:38:26,340 --> 01:38:28,060
Top tip top red shape.

2288
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,040
Call Master Miller.

2289
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,920
What's he gonna say to me?

2290
01:38:34,460 --> 01:38:37,560
So Naomi's a spy, just like I thought.

2291
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:39,700
Campbell is hiding something too.

2292
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:40,120
Yeah.

2293
01:38:40,440 --> 01:38:41,220
But that's okay.

2294
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:44,340
Fox dye is a virus, a biological weapon.

2295
01:38:44,700 --> 01:38:46,560
There must be a vaccine.

2296
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:49,060
We can worry about getting that later, Snake.

2297
01:38:49,180 --> 01:38:53,500
But right now, you've got to focus on re-inputting those detonation codes.

2298
01:38:53,680 --> 01:38:54,020
I mean...

2299
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,740
He seems really... You're kinda... You seem a little desperate there.

2300
01:38:58,320 --> 01:38:58,920
I'm in.

2301
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,780
The key changed shape.

2302
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,540
Hurry to the control room.

2303
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:05,800
That's the last key.

2304
01:39:06,460 --> 01:39:08,240
Master, I've never heard you so excited.

2305
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:09,740
I was gonna say, he seems really excited.

2306
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:13,820
Master?

2307
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:18,640
Master?

2308
01:39:19,900 --> 01:39:21,580
The key changed shape.

2309
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,360
Hurry to the control room.

2310
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,620
That's the last key.

2311
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:25,860
Mr. Miller.

2312
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:26,920
Mr. Miller.

2313
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:31,640
Are you in the boiler room?

2314
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:33,500
Those pipes are really old.

2315
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:36,380
Once in a while, they blow out steam, so be careful.

2316
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,740
I've always been careful.

2317
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:38,940
Call this, once in a while.

2318
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,320
Snake is so sassy.

2319
01:39:48,380 --> 01:39:49,920
Watch out for the steam.

2320
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:50,960
It's dangerous.

2321
01:39:51,340 --> 01:39:54,840
Use your first person view to see when the steam is coming out.

2322
01:39:54,840 --> 01:39:56,300
And then avoid it.

2323
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:57,020
I love it.

2324
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:57,200
Yeah.

2325
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,220
I like Asana now and then, but this is too much.

2326
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:02,620
I love these codec calls.

2327
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,260
Alright, I think we're good now.

2328
01:40:04,440 --> 01:40:05,060
Wait, what's that?

2329
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:07,080
Is that a rat over there?

2330
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:09,060
Wait, what are the red dots?

2331
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:10,860
Oh no, those are people.

2332
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:12,940
Right?

2333
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,280
No, they're not.

2334
01:40:15,660 --> 01:40:16,500
What am I seeing?

2335
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:17,760
Anyway, let's just leave.

2336
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:22,560
Okay.

2337
01:40:24,420 --> 01:40:24,860
Okay.

2338
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:27,620
Run, run, run.

2339
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:30,180
Wait, if I put the PAL key away, it's better, right?

2340
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:31,860
Technically, I think.

2341
01:40:35,120 --> 01:40:37,060
I gotta stuff it in my pants.

2342
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:41,740
Metaphorical rats.

2343
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,160
What does that mean?

2344
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,320
Oh no, it's all the nuclear waste here.

2345
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,380
They're basically just rat people.

2346
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,960
Neither true rat or true person.

2347
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,300
They are both.

2348
01:40:57,120 --> 01:40:57,960
What pants?

2349
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:04,220
You know how girls will keep stuff in their bras?

2350
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:06,240
Like money and stuff?

2351
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:10,200
I've never done that before because I think...

2352
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,300
Oh my god.

2353
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:16,100
I'm in a hurry, man!

2354
01:41:20,300 --> 01:41:21,520
I'm just gonna run for it.

2355
01:41:26,090 --> 01:41:26,650
Perfect.

2356
01:41:27,010 --> 01:41:27,610
Let's go.

2357
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:30,490
It's so gross.

2358
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:31,530
People will like...

2359
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:38,990
I've worked retail where like some lady will pull out a $10 bill from her bra and it's literally damp.

2360
01:41:40,170 --> 01:41:41,750
It's so gross.

2361
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:44,530
It's so nasty.

2362
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:47,430
Because it falls straight through.

2363
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:48,450
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2364
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:50,210
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2365
01:41:50,450 --> 01:41:53,010
If you wear a bra, it's not gonna fall out.

2366
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:55,610
Gosh, you guys.

2367
01:41:55,910 --> 01:41:56,470
Oh my god.

2368
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:57,830
Oh my god.

2369
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,850
Oh my god.

2370
01:41:57,850 --> 01:41:57,910
Oh my god.

2371
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:00,690
Payblade.

2372
01:42:01,230 --> 01:42:02,130
Ladder rip.

2373
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:09,610
Snake,

2374
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:13,810
can you hear me?

2375
01:42:13,870 --> 01:42:14,110
Naomi.

2376
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:14,870
It's Naomi.

2377
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:15,870
Naomi?

2378
01:42:16,190 --> 01:42:16,970
What the hell?

2379
01:42:17,150 --> 01:42:18,070
I know that British millennial.

2380
01:42:18,070 --> 01:42:19,450
Camp Millennials are busy right now.

2381
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:21,270
I'm on a different codec.

2382
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:24,370
Naomi, is what the Colonel says true?

2383
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:28,630
Yes, but not everything I said was a lie.

2384
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:30,090
Who are you?

2385
01:42:30,150 --> 01:42:30,750
Who are you?

2386
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:31,730
I don't know myself.

2387
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:36,150
I don't know my real name or even what my parents looked like.

2388
01:42:36,750 --> 01:42:38,430
I bought all my identification.

2389
01:42:39,250 --> 01:42:41,970
But my reason for getting into genetics was true.

2390
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:44,390
Because you want to know yourself, right?

2391
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:45,410
That's right.

2392
01:42:45,850 --> 01:42:48,070
I want to know where I came from.

2393
01:42:48,430 --> 01:42:50,590
My age, my race, anything.

2394
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:52,190
You're white.

2395
01:42:52,410 --> 01:42:53,270
And British.

2396
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:56,290
I was found in Rhodesia sometime in the 80s.

2397
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:57,930
A dirty little orphan.

2398
01:42:58,890 --> 01:42:59,330
Rhodesia?

2399
01:42:59,690 --> 01:43:01,290
What's now known as Zimbabwe?

2400
01:43:02,730 --> 01:43:03,170
Yes.

2401
01:43:03,170 --> 01:43:07,870
Rhodesia was owned by England until 1965 and there were lots of Indian laborers around.

2402
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:12,470
That's probably where I got my skin color from, but I'm not even sure about that.

2403
01:43:13,430 --> 01:43:14,450
See, even she says it.

2404
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:15,570
Naomi, you're too worried about the past.

2405
01:43:16,170 --> 01:43:18,130
Isn't it enough to understand who you are now?

2406
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,590
Understand who I am now?

2407
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:21,570
Why should I?

2408
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:23,190
No one else tries to understand me.

2409
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:25,370
I love this track.

2410
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:27,050
I was alone for so long.

2411
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:29,470
Until I met my big brother.

2412
01:43:30,030 --> 01:43:31,150
And him.

2413
01:43:31,410 --> 01:43:31,690
Him?

2414
01:43:31,990 --> 01:43:32,630
Your big brother.

2415
01:43:34,570 --> 01:43:35,130
Yes.

2416
01:43:35,130 --> 01:43:36,110
Frank Jaeger.

2417
01:43:36,510 --> 01:43:37,070
What?

2418
01:43:38,810 --> 01:43:40,330
He was a young soldier.

2419
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:42,730
Frank Jaeger!

2420
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:44,730
Wait a second.

2421
01:43:44,890 --> 01:43:46,450
I was half dead from starvation.

2422
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:46,870
Jaeger?

2423
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:48,390
He shared his rations with me.

2424
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:49,710
Hunter!

2425
01:43:50,210 --> 01:43:50,530
Yes.

2426
01:43:51,390 --> 01:43:52,550
Frank Jaeger.

2427
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:56,830
The man who you destroyed was my brother and my only family.

2428
01:43:57,930 --> 01:43:58,150
No.

2429
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:59,030
No.

2430
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:00,350
Gray Fox?

2431
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:01,350
Oh my god!

2432
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:03,930
We survived that hill together, Frank and I.

2433
01:44:04,690 --> 01:44:05,910
Jaeger is...

2434
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:06,410
He protected me.

2435
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:07,510
...Hunter in German!

2436
01:44:07,930 --> 01:44:09,230
It's my one connection.

2437
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,150
I never made the connection!

2438
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:12,890
The only connection I have to my past.

2439
01:44:13,550 --> 01:44:15,790
And he brought you back to America.

2440
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:16,850
No.

2441
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:19,830
I was in Mozambique when he came.

2442
01:44:20,690 --> 01:44:21,790
Who is he?

2443
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,350
You mean Big Boss?

2444
01:44:24,350 --> 01:44:25,130
Yes.

2445
01:44:26,850 --> 01:44:29,070
He brought us to this land of freedom.

2446
01:44:29,530 --> 01:44:30,310
This America.

2447
01:44:32,330 --> 01:44:35,490
Then he and my brother went back to Africa to continue the war.

2448
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:35,850
Thank you.

2449
01:44:36,990 --> 01:44:38,210
And that's when it happened.

2450
01:44:39,390 --> 01:44:43,490
You killed my benefactor and sent my brother home a cripple.

2451
01:44:44,610 --> 01:44:46,950
I vowed revenge and joined Foxhound.

2452
01:44:47,170 --> 01:44:47,590
But...

2453
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:52,230
I knew it was my best chance to meet you and I prayed for the day that I would.

2454
01:44:52,390 --> 01:44:53,470
I was part of Foxhound.

2455
01:44:53,530 --> 01:44:54,310
Why would you join Foxhound?

2456
01:44:54,310 --> 01:44:55,170
May I ask your prayers answered?

2457
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:57,590
Yes.

2458
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:00,690
I waited two long years.

2459
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:01,870
Shut up Naomi.

2460
01:45:02,230 --> 01:45:04,150
Is that all you cared about?

2461
01:45:04,470 --> 01:45:04,970
Yes.

2462
01:45:05,010 --> 01:45:05,770
I tried.

2463
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:07,410
What?

2464
01:45:07,570 --> 01:45:08,190
Two years.

2465
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:11,630
You were all I thought about for too long...

2466
01:45:11,630 --> 01:45:13,470
Gosh, everyone's so obsessed with me!

2467
01:45:15,330 --> 01:45:17,370
Just like sniperwolf!

2468
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:18,410
Just like Naomi!

2469
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:21,670
Everybody's obsessed with the legend.

2470
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:22,610
...Not exactly.

2471
01:45:22,610 --> 01:45:24,290
I was partly wrong about you as well.

2472
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:38,430
Rent-free.

2473
01:45:45,810 --> 01:45:51,790
Hunter has English for Jaeger?

2474
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:55,650
I think he just came here to fight you.

2475
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:58,570
I wasn't sure before, but now I think I understand.

2476
01:45:59,730 --> 01:46:01,390
A final battle with you.

2477
01:46:02,110 --> 01:46:03,270
That's all he lives for.

2478
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:04,610
I'm sure of it.

2479
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:06,750
Fox.

2480
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:07,230
No.

2481
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:07,870
Gray Fox.

2482
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:11,530
Naomi, tell me something.

2483
01:46:12,430 --> 01:46:13,650
About Fox Dye?

2484
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:20,110
Fox Dye is a type of retrovirus that targets and kills only specific people.

2485
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:20,690
That's crazy.

2486
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:23,610
First, it infects the macrophages in the victim's body.

2487
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:28,350
Fox Dye contains smart enzymes created through protein engineering.

2488
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:30,870
I mean, I know this is a game, but still.

2489
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:33,790
So retro.

2490
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:35,930
Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA?

2491
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,910
Right.

2492
01:46:37,490 --> 01:46:43,150
They respond by becoming active and using the macrophages as they begin creating TNF Epsilon.

2493
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:43,410
Hello, Miko.

2494
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:43,530
Hello!

2495
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:48,950
It's a type of cytokine, a peptide which causes cells to die.

2496
01:46:49,430 --> 01:46:52,550
The TNF Epsilon is carried along the bloodstream to the heart...

2497
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:53,270
Yawn, yawn, nerd talk.

2498
01:46:53,270 --> 01:46:55,370
...where they attach to the TNF receptors in the heart cells.

2499
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:57,250
Come on, Naomi.

2500
01:46:57,370 --> 01:46:57,670
Pick it up.

2501
01:46:57,950 --> 01:46:58,410
...they cause a heart attack.

2502
01:46:58,610 --> 01:47:02,550
The heart cells suffer a shock and undergo an extreme apoptosis.

2503
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:05,550
Then, the victim dies.

2504
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:07,070
Apoptosis?

2505
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:09,430
You mean the heart cells commit suicide?

2506
01:47:10,910 --> 01:47:11,550
Naomi's a...

2507
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:12,470
What?

2508
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:14,350
Naomi's a brocon.

2509
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:16,150
You must have programmed that thing to kill me, too.

2510
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:16,850
Right?

2511
01:47:18,530 --> 01:47:20,330
Do I still have time?

2512
01:47:23,690 --> 01:47:28,130
Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead, but I can't go yet.

2513
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:29,910
I still have a job to do.

2514
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:32,550
You dumb... What about... What's the vaccine, though?

2515
01:47:32,630 --> 01:47:33,350
You know, like...

2516
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:34,190
Listen, Snake...

2517
01:47:34,190 --> 01:47:36,410
She just creates this thing and then doesn't make a vaccine for it?

2518
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:38,270
I'm not the one who made the decision to use FOXDIE.

2519
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:40,710
You weren't.

2520
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:46,870
You were injected with FOXDIE as a part of this operation.

2521
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:50,030
I just wanted to let you know that.

2522
01:47:51,570 --> 01:47:53,350
No, that's not the whole truth.

2523
01:47:53,590 --> 01:47:53,890
Come on.

2524
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:55,610
Naomi, you compulsive liar, you!

2525
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:56,770
Snake just...

2526
01:47:56,770 --> 01:47:58,990
The real thing I wanted to tell you was...

2527
01:47:58,990 --> 01:48:00,010
Huh?

2528
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:01,170
Snake, I...

2529
01:48:02,730 --> 01:48:04,290
You've fallen in love with me.

2530
01:48:05,950 --> 01:48:06,470
Snake!

2531
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:07,730
Snake!

2532
01:48:08,430 --> 01:48:08,950
Snake!

2533
01:48:09,630 --> 01:48:10,150
Naomi!

2534
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:12,430
Colonel!

2535
01:48:12,950 --> 01:48:16,690
I can't allow Naomi to make any more unauthorized transmissions.

2536
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:17,190
What?

2537
01:48:17,890 --> 01:48:19,750
Naomi's been removed from this operation.

2538
01:48:20,290 --> 01:48:21,530
What happened to Naomi?

2539
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:25,030
What did she mean when she said that FOXDIE was a part of this operation?

2540
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:27,050
Colonel, let me talk to her.

2541
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:27,950
I won't.

2542
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:29,270
She's under arrest.

2543
01:48:29,630 --> 01:48:30,030
Colonel!

2544
01:48:30,550 --> 01:48:31,770
You double-crossed me.

2545
01:48:32,010 --> 01:48:34,170
Snake, there's no time for that.

2546
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:37,550
Right now, your job is to stop Metal Gear.

2547
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:39,410
Colonel is so slimy in this game.

2548
01:48:40,950 --> 01:48:41,950
He's so...

2549
01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:44,410
He's so...

2550
01:48:44,930 --> 01:48:46,350
I was trying to grab him.

2551
01:48:46,350 --> 01:48:48,530
He's so slimy in this game.

2552
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:49,310
I hate it.

2553
01:48:55,100 --> 01:48:57,580
Alright, we gotta try and get through here, you guys.

2554
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,120
We gotta try and get through here.

2555
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:02,100
Without getting detected.

2556
01:49:04,180 --> 01:49:05,000
I'm nervous.

2557
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:08,420
Yeah, back to card time.

2558
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:10,680
Okay.

2559
01:49:12,240 --> 01:49:13,020
Just run.

2560
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:13,980
Just run.

2561
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:15,020
Just run.

2562
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:16,040
Just run.

2563
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:17,620
Nice.

2564
01:49:22,380 --> 01:49:23,500
Thank you.

2565
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:25,460
Okay.

2566
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:27,840
Chaff grenade.

2567
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:34,200
Nice.

2568
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:45,190
How's our key looking?

2569
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:49,430
It's quite red.

2570
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:50,290
For now.

2571
01:49:50,890 --> 01:49:51,770
Damn.

2572
01:49:52,110 --> 01:49:52,450
Damn.

2573
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:53,030
Damn.

2574
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:53,430
Damn.

2575
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:56,210
Damn.

2576
01:49:56,210 --> 01:49:57,250
Oh, I love that angle.

2577
01:49:58,670 --> 01:50:02,470
I love the angles that show you how massive Rex is.

2578
01:50:03,050 --> 01:50:03,930
It's so fun.

2579
01:50:05,210 --> 01:50:05,910
Mint tomato.

2580
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,760
We'll need those later, you guys.

2581
01:50:17,260 --> 01:50:18,400
Oh, wrong way.

2582
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:18,720
Wrong way.

2583
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:20,220
We'll need them later.

2584
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,120
It's critical.

2585
01:50:23,940 --> 01:50:25,500
Peter O'clock virus.

2586
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:27,240
Stop!

2587
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:31,560
Alright.

2588
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:35,120
Run, run, run!

2589
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:39,530
Alright, let's kill this guy.

2590
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:40,130
Maybe?

2591
01:50:41,210 --> 01:50:42,370
Maybe I shouldn't kill him.

2592
01:50:42,710 --> 01:50:44,370
I think actually...

2593
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:46,670
Wait, where is he?

2594
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:48,710
No, he's not in back.

2595
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,330
I think we can just...

2596
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:53,030
Go through.

2597
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:07,960
Alright.

2598
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:11,260
Our... Our... Our...

2599
01:51:11,260 --> 01:51:12,800
Our code is still good?

2600
01:51:13,060 --> 01:51:13,300
Okay.

2601
01:51:13,540 --> 01:51:14,640
Nice and nice too.

2602
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:16,560
Let's...

2603
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:19,000
Hide from...

2604
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,320
Oh my goodness.

2605
01:51:20,480 --> 01:51:20,760
Please.

2606
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:22,020
There we go.

2607
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:26,200
Oh my god.

2608
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,980
And then...

2609
01:51:28,980 --> 01:51:30,000
I think I can just...

2610
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,460
Howl key it up.

2611
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:33,380
There we go!

2612
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:34,340
Yippee!

2613
01:51:36,260 --> 01:51:37,780
They don't even need the chaff.

2614
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,820
Howl code number three.

2615
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:42,520
Confirm...

2616
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:43,760
Yay, we saved the world!

2617
01:51:45,020 --> 01:51:45,040
Howl code entry.

2618
01:51:45,200 --> 01:51:45,280
Confirm...

2619
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:45,800
Yippee!

2620
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:49,180
Detonation code.

2621
01:51:49,540 --> 01:51:50,200
Activated.

2622
01:51:50,200 --> 01:51:50,640
No.

2623
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:51,340
Why?

2624
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:54,940
No!

2625
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:00,900
I deactivated it!

2626
01:52:00,980 --> 01:52:02,340
I deactivated it!

2627
01:52:05,100 --> 01:52:06,500
Thank you, snake.

2628
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:07,280
Now it's your turn.

2629
01:52:07,280 --> 01:52:07,320
Help me.

2630
01:52:07,380 --> 01:52:07,700
I need...

2631
01:52:07,700 --> 01:52:07,740
Help me.

2632
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,400
How could you?

2633
01:52:20,020 --> 01:52:24,380
I let the colonel double-cross you, but how could you double-cross me, too?

2634
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:28,840
Gosh...

2635
01:52:33,580 --> 01:52:37,500
The fact that Snake has no idea what's going on this entire game...

2636
01:52:37,780 --> 01:52:39,460
It's just so sad.

2637
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:40,980
How could you?

2638
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:41,400
No!

2639
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:50,800
In other words, we weren't able to launch the nuclear device and we were all getting a little worried.

2640
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:55,740
Without the threat of a nuclear strike, our demands would never be met.

2641
01:52:56,120 --> 01:52:57,360
What do you mean?

2642
01:52:57,660 --> 01:53:01,980
Without the detonation codes, we had to find some other way.

2643
01:53:02,340 --> 01:53:07,200
That's when we decided you might prove useful, Snake.

2644
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:07,920
What?

2645
01:53:08,280 --> 01:53:12,400
First, I thought we might get the information from you, Snake.

2646
01:53:12,660 --> 01:53:17,100
So I had Decoy Octopus disguise himself as the DARPA chief.

2647
01:53:17,420 --> 01:53:21,700
Unfortunately, Octopus didn't survive the encounter.

2648
01:53:22,280 --> 01:53:23,780
Thanks to FOXDOT.

2649
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,160
You mean you had this planned from the beginning?

2650
01:53:27,360 --> 01:53:29,660
Just to get me to input the detonation code?

2651
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:35,500
You didn't think you made it this far by yourself, did you?

2652
01:53:35,620 --> 01:53:36,380
What a jerk.

2653
01:53:36,380 --> 01:53:36,920
Where the hell are you?

2654
01:53:37,260 --> 01:53:40,820
In any case, the launch preparations are complete.

2655
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:50,940
Once the world glimpses the power of this weapon, the White House will have no choice but to surrender the FOXDOT vaccine to me.

2656
01:53:51,200 --> 01:53:54,740
Their ace in the hole is useless now.

2657
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:55,500
No!

2658
01:53:55,900 --> 01:54:03,260
But the Pentagon's plan to use you was already successful in the torture room.

2659
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:05,900
Stop laughing!

2660
01:54:06,480 --> 01:54:09,020
You're the only one who doesn't know.

2661
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:10,120
Thank you for the $50,000.

2662
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:10,740
Thank you.

2663
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:11,240
Fool.

2664
01:54:11,880 --> 01:54:13,200
Who are you anyway?

2665
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,520
I'll tell you everything you want to know.

2666
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:16,040
Yes, yes, yes.

2667
01:54:16,100 --> 01:54:16,440
Here we go.

2668
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:18,580
If you come where I am, that is.

2669
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:20,720
Where are you?

2670
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:23,020
Very close by.

2671
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,540
Snake, that's not Master Miller.

2672
01:54:26,680 --> 01:54:27,100
No shit.

2673
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:29,180
Campbell, you're too late.

2674
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:31,620
Oh my god, the voice change is so great.

2675
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:32,820
Master Miller's body was just discovered at his home.

2676
01:54:33,080 --> 01:54:35,000
He's been dead for at least three days.

2677
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:35,320
What?

2678
01:54:35,680 --> 01:54:38,560
I didn't know because my codec link with Master was cut off.

2679
01:54:38,620 --> 01:54:40,700
You don't confirm these things, Colonel.

2680
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:43,500
But Maylene said his transmission signal was coming from inside the base.

2681
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:44,040
Oh my god.

2682
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:45,660
So who is it?

2683
01:54:45,900 --> 01:54:48,640
Snake, you've been talking to...

2684
01:54:48,640 --> 01:54:49,180
Oh my god.

2685
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:51,340
Me, dear brother.

2686
01:54:53,420 --> 01:54:54,060
Yeah!

2687
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:58,720
Liquid, how the...

2688
01:54:58,720 --> 01:55:00,400
You've served your purpose.

2689
01:55:00,620 --> 01:55:02,880
You may die now.

2690
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:03,500
No!

2691
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:06,540
Oh my god.

2692
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:07,640
Yes!

2693
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:12,320
Oh my god.

2694
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:14,800
Otacon!

2695
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:21,250
Snake, that's bulletproof glass.

2696
01:55:21,710 --> 01:55:23,290
You can't break it with an ordinary weapon.

2697
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:24,550
Too sexy for my sunglasses, brother.

2698
01:55:25,170 --> 01:55:25,970
Can you open the security lock here?

2699
01:55:26,110 --> 01:55:26,630
Otacon, please.

2700
01:55:26,690 --> 01:55:26,790
I'll try.

2701
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:28,450
Just hold on for a minute.

2702
01:55:28,510 --> 01:55:28,790
Okay.

2703
01:55:28,870 --> 01:55:29,890
I don't have a minute.

2704
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:33,570
Oh wow, for Cousin Hero Miller.

2705
01:55:33,570 --> 01:55:35,890
Snake, Imerit will be able to open the door.

2706
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:37,230
Just trust him and hang on.

2707
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:37,690
Okay.

2708
01:55:38,010 --> 01:55:39,730
I don't trust you though.

2709
01:55:41,730 --> 01:55:42,210
Master!

2710
01:55:43,390 --> 01:55:45,410
Why is my head so small?

2711
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,530
Oh, there's rations in here.

2712
01:55:52,610 --> 01:55:54,930
I look like a bean.

2713
01:55:56,430 --> 01:55:57,490
Like a pea head.

2714
01:55:58,470 --> 01:56:00,890
Snake, I'm opening the door.

2715
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:01,650
Thanks, Otacon!

2716
01:56:03,570 --> 01:56:04,010
Yippee!

2717
01:56:04,550 --> 01:56:06,310
Oh, I gave you another ration even.

2718
01:56:07,730 --> 01:56:08,630
I'm just like, hey.

2719
01:56:09,770 --> 01:56:10,970
You're not feeling so well?

2720
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:11,550
Oh my god.

2721
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:19,090
It's actually maybe one of my favorite parts of the game.

2722
01:56:19,210 --> 01:56:19,870
I'm not gonna lie.

2723
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:26,410
Do you guys mind if I can get some food before the Rex fight?

2724
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:32,690
So I can eat while Liquid is doing his little monologuing.

2725
01:56:32,690 --> 01:56:34,990
So I'm gonna go grab some food real quick.

2726
01:56:36,790 --> 01:56:37,830
I'll be fast.

2727
01:56:38,230 --> 01:56:39,770
I don't have to heal.

2728
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:42,590
I'll be right back.

2729
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:44,510
Give me like just a few minutes.

2730
01:56:48,050 --> 01:56:48,490
Back,

2731
01:58:25,860 --> 01:58:26,480
I'm back, I'm back.

2732
01:58:26,540 --> 01:58:27,120
Sorry about that.

2733
01:58:27,280 --> 01:58:28,320
Alright, hold on.

2734
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:30,580
I have to move a little bit of stuff.

2735
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:34,180
Okay, alright.

2736
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:38,560
Don't spill it.

2737
01:58:39,640 --> 01:58:40,540
Don't spill it.

2738
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,200
Okay.

2739
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,400
Here we go.

2740
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,000
Welcome back.

2741
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:43,700
Thank you.

2742
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:45,100
Thank you, thank you guys.

2743
01:58:45,340 --> 01:58:47,060
Alright, we ready for...

2744
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:48,480
Let's go.

2745
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:50,420
Time for me to eat.

2746
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:53,460
Oh.

2747
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:56,180
Wow, that's a whole lot of Liquid.

2748
01:58:56,640 --> 01:58:58,240
Really, you just baited me so much.

2749
01:59:04,720 --> 01:59:06,220
Oh, I'm still gone fishing.

2750
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:09,200
There we go.

2751
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:14,220
Dang, look at his abs.

2752
01:59:15,580 --> 01:59:17,400
This guy never has a shirt on.

2753
01:59:17,640 --> 01:59:18,340
It's Alaska.

2754
01:59:18,820 --> 01:59:20,100
What are you showing off for?

2755
01:59:20,300 --> 01:59:20,460
Liquid.

2756
01:59:20,920 --> 01:59:21,440
Snake.

2757
01:59:22,540 --> 01:59:24,300
Did you like my sunglasses?

2758
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,240
Whoa.

2759
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:29,380
You point a weapon at your own brother?

2760
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:31,480
Why did you disguise yourself as master?

2761
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:34,240
So I could manipulate you more easily.

2762
01:59:34,540 --> 01:59:37,000
And you performed quite well, I must say.

2763
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:39,180
Although, the boy is a little bit of a pain in the ass.

2764
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:42,200
The boys at the Pentagon are probably saying the same thing.

2765
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,080
What the hell are you talking about?

2766
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:46,960
Following orders blindly with no questions asked.

2767
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:50,640
You've lost your warrior's pride and become nothing more than a palm snake.

2768
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:51,480
What?

2769
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:52,980
Get called out.

2770
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:55,860
Stopping the nuclear launch, rescuing the hostages.

2771
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:57,280
It was all just a diversion.

2772
01:59:58,140 --> 01:59:58,760
A diversion?

2773
01:59:59,180 --> 02:00:02,920
The Pentagon only needed for you to come into contact with us.

2774
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:06,780
That's what killed the arms tech president and decoy octopus.

2775
02:00:07,040 --> 02:00:08,140
Snakes look good in that little eyes.

2776
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:08,600
You don't mean.

2777
02:00:09,200 --> 02:00:09,580
That's right.

2778
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:17,140
You were sent here to kill us so they could retrieve metal gear undamaged, along with the bodies of the Genome soldiers.

2779
02:00:17,680 --> 02:00:22,440
From the beginning, the Pentagon was just using you as a vector to spread fox dye.

2780
02:00:22,840 --> 02:00:23,580
Fox dye?

2781
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:24,700
It can't be.

2782
02:00:24,980 --> 02:00:27,600
Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon?

2783
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:29,660
They thought she was.

2784
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:33,700
But it seems that Dr. Naomi Hunter couldn't be controlled so easily.

2785
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:35,180
Everybody is a double crosser.

2786
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:37,160
We've got a spy working in the Pentagon.

2787
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:42,760
He reported that Dr. Hunter altered Fox Dye's program just before the operation.

2788
02:00:42,980 --> 02:00:45,640
But no one knows how or why.

2789
02:00:46,540 --> 02:00:47,780
Because she's crazy.

2790
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:51,920
Maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that.

2791
02:00:52,200 --> 02:00:53,180
No doubt.

2792
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:58,240
But I had no idea she was motivated by such petty revenge.

2793
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:02,480
We still don't know what changes she made to Fox Dye's program.

2794
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:04,400
He's so disappointed.

2795
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:05,460
Oh well, it doesn't matter.

2796
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:10,120
I've already added the Fox Dye vaccine to my list of White House demands.

2797
02:01:10,720 --> 02:01:11,440
There's a vaccine.

2798
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,060
There must be.

2799
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:13,040
But if she changed it, then...

2800
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,300
But that woman is the only one who really knows.

2801
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,800
If she changed it, then it doesn't, you know...

2802
02:01:17,800 --> 02:01:20,260
Anyway, it might prove to be unnecessary.

2803
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:22,420
Why's that?

2804
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:26,460
You were successful in coming into contact with all of us.

2805
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:29,420
So we must have all been exposed to the virus.

2806
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:35,440
It's true that the Armstech president and Decoy Octopus were killed by Fox Dye.

2807
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:41,640
But Ocelot, myself, and you, the carrier, were apparently unaffected.

2808
02:01:41,700 --> 02:01:43,980
A bug in the virus's programming?

2809
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:45,640
Could be.

2810
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:50,180
In any case, if it doesn't kill you, then I'm not worried either.

2811
02:01:50,420 --> 02:01:53,380
After all, our genetic code is identical.

2812
02:01:53,800 --> 02:01:54,620
So it's true.

2813
02:01:54,760 --> 02:01:55,980
You and I are...

2814
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,600
Yes, twins.

2815
02:01:58,280 --> 02:02:00,320
But we're not ordinary twins.

2816
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:03,220
We're twins linked by cursed genes.

2817
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:04,480
Genes?

2818
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,160
Les enfants terribles.

2819
02:02:07,060 --> 02:02:09,240
Les enfants terribles.

2820
02:02:09,500 --> 02:02:10,280
You got all the old man's dominant genes.

2821
02:02:10,680 --> 02:02:13,460
I got the flawed recessive genes.

2822
02:02:13,900 --> 02:02:17,500
Everything was done so that you would be the greatest of his children.

2823
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:19,220
I got the acid wash genes.

2824
02:02:19,260 --> 02:02:22,980
The only reason I exist is so they could create you.

2825
02:02:23,200 --> 02:02:25,300
I was the favorite, huh?

2826
02:02:25,820 --> 02:02:26,600
That's right.

2827
02:02:27,440 --> 02:02:30,640
I'm just the leftovers of what they used to make you.

2828
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:34,340
Can you understand what it's like to know that your garbage...

2829
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:36,000
...has changed since the day you were born?

2830
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:37,900
But...

2831
02:02:38,860 --> 02:02:40,820
I'm the one father chose.

2832
02:02:41,660 --> 02:02:44,480
So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss.

2833
02:02:44,760 --> 02:02:46,320
Some warped kind of love.

2834
02:02:47,260 --> 02:02:47,860
Love?

2835
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:49,900
It's hate!

2836
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:52,760
He always told me I was inferior.

2837
02:02:53,140 --> 02:02:55,400
And now I'll have my revenge!

2838
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:56,780
Big Boss!

2839
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:58,740
I can't imagine him saying that, you know?

2840
02:02:58,860 --> 02:03:01,380
You killed our father with your own hands!

2841
02:03:01,600 --> 02:03:04,520
I just can't imagine him being like, Hey, inferior brother!

2842
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:05,680
Over there!

2843
02:03:05,940 --> 02:03:08,880
Now I'll finish the work that father began!

2844
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:11,080
I will surpass him!

2845
02:03:11,220 --> 02:03:12,660
I will destroy him!

2846
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,980
You're just like Naomi.

2847
02:03:15,500 --> 02:03:16,600
Well, I'm not like you!

2848
02:03:16,900 --> 02:03:18,120
I'm like you!

2849
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:22,100
I'm proud of the destiny that is encoded into my fairy genes!

2850
02:03:22,540 --> 02:03:22,920
Uh-oh.

2851
02:03:22,980 --> 02:03:24,000
Is it time?

2852
02:03:24,920 --> 02:03:25,860
It's close to time.

2853
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:28,120
Snake!

2854
02:03:28,540 --> 02:03:33,040
Your blood will be the first to be spilled by this glorious new weapon!

2855
02:03:33,180 --> 02:03:33,280
Like you?

2856
02:03:33,300 --> 02:03:34,040
No!

2857
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:35,500
Consider it an honor!

2858
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:37,340
A gift from your brother!

2859
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:43,940
Now I'll show you the power of the weapon that will lead us in the 21st century!

2860
02:03:43,940 --> 02:03:44,820
Okay, I got my controller.

2861
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,000
I put away my food.

2862
02:03:46,340 --> 02:03:46,960
It's moving.

2863
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:53,780
I wonder how I'm gonna do on the fist fight.

2864
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,220
Like this!

2865
02:03:58,520 --> 02:03:59,580
How do I stop it?

2866
02:04:02,930 --> 02:04:03,630
Ta-da!

2867
02:04:11,250 --> 02:04:11,390
Here we go.

2868
02:04:15,590 --> 02:04:16,310
Here we go.

2869
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:19,410
Here we go.

2870
02:04:19,550 --> 02:04:20,270
Here we go.

2871
02:04:21,150 --> 02:04:21,630
Ow!

2872
02:04:29,320 --> 02:04:30,180
I look so awesome!

2873
02:04:31,760 --> 02:04:33,460
Guys, I'm getting a stomachache already.

2874
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,500
Immediately, body armor.

2875
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:53,120
Immediately, trap grenades.

2876
02:04:53,640 --> 02:04:54,120
Run!

2877
02:04:54,720 --> 02:04:55,140
What

2878
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:00,360
the hell?

2879
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:00,900
Oh my god!

2880
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:01,100
No!

2881
02:05:01,180 --> 02:05:02,520
What are you doing?

2882
02:05:02,640 --> 02:05:03,060
Okay, hold on.

2883
02:05:03,060 --> 02:05:03,980
That's not what I meant to do.

2884
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,940
I meant to call Auto-Gun.

2885
02:05:11,020 --> 02:05:13,900
What do I do?

2886
02:05:16,100 --> 02:05:17,140
What do I do?

2887
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:18,860
What?

2888
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:20,620
Stop!

2889
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:34,480
Okay.

2890
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,980
Naked eyes.

2891
02:05:37,180 --> 02:05:38,960
His special eyes.

2892
02:05:40,040 --> 02:05:41,240
Yeah!

2893
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:44,600
Yeah!

2894
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:49,720
Alright!

2895
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,920
Keyboard duck.

2896
02:05:53,120 --> 02:05:53,880
Stinger missile!

2897
02:05:57,380 --> 02:06:00,400
I already threw the chat.

2898
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,000
The Ray Dome.

2899
02:06:07,140 --> 02:06:08,280
Oh, look at that.

2900
02:06:09,860 --> 02:06:10,560
Ah!

2901
02:06:12,760 --> 02:06:14,760
The Ray Dome.

2902
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:25,160
As much as I hate to acknowledge MGS5, the implication is that it's how Liquid felt rather than the reality.

2903
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:26,900
It's a good point.

2904
02:06:27,980 --> 02:06:29,340
Character flaw.

2905
02:06:33,060 --> 02:06:33,140
I think.

2906
02:06:33,460 --> 02:06:34,320
I guess so.

2907
02:06:34,660 --> 02:06:35,880
I owe you one, Otacon.

2908
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:37,900
Okay.

2909
02:06:41,500 --> 02:06:42,480
I will save.

2910
02:06:42,520 --> 02:06:43,980
I know it's probably pointless.

2911
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:46,980
Snake, there's nothing I can do to help you.

2912
02:06:47,240 --> 02:06:48,960
All I can do is cheer you on.

2913
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:51,040
I know it's kind of pointless, but I am going to save.

2914
02:06:52,180 --> 02:06:55,140
We'll save because, you know, what if something crashes, right?

2915
02:06:57,460 --> 02:06:57,860
Okay.

2916
02:06:58,340 --> 02:06:59,140
Don't give up.

2917
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:00,220
Don't give up!

2918
02:07:01,520 --> 02:07:02,220
I'm scared.

2919
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:02,720
I'm scared!

2920
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:03,140
I'm scared.

2921
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:03,540
I'm scared!

2922
02:07:04,380 --> 02:07:04,860
I'm scared!

2923
02:07:05,220 --> 02:07:05,700
Guys!

2924
02:07:33,110 --> 02:07:34,210
Guys, it's not good!

2925
02:07:34,330 --> 02:07:35,530
Not a good start!

2926
02:07:35,950 --> 02:07:36,770
Not a good start!

2927
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:38,670
Not good start!

2928
02:07:38,790 --> 02:07:39,550
Not good start!

2929
02:07:39,850 --> 02:07:40,870
Not good start!

2930
02:07:41,730 --> 02:07:42,210
Okay.

2931
02:07:42,450 --> 02:07:42,930
Okay.

2932
02:07:43,230 --> 02:07:43,670
Okay.

2933
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:45,250
Okay.

2934
02:07:45,950 --> 02:07:46,430
Stinger.

2935
02:07:47,750 --> 02:07:48,450
Explode, please!

2936
02:07:50,730 --> 02:07:51,850
Did I even throw it?

2937
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:53,710
I don't think I threw the chat grenade.

2938
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:56,290
Gosh.

2939
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:02,560
There we go.

2940
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:06,260
Okay, I'm

2941
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,580
going to really concentrate on this part.

2942
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:29,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

2943
02:08:29,880 --> 02:08:31,340
Oh god, oh god.

2944
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:34,360
Please!

2945
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:39,180
My body armor, I gotta re-equip it.

2946
02:09:42,990 --> 02:09:45,700
This thing can still seek me out so easily.

2947
02:09:56,190 --> 02:09:56,590
Snake!

2948
02:09:57,250 --> 02:09:57,650
Snake!

2949
02:10:05,180 --> 02:10:06,940
We have Zanzibar counter one!

2950
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:08,260
We haven't even hit Zanzibar!

2951
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,720
It's okay, we started off really bad, so...

2952
02:10:16,900 --> 02:10:18,220
Can I skip this part?

2953
02:10:18,340 --> 02:10:18,860
Okay, there we go.

2954
02:10:18,940 --> 02:10:19,160
Alright.

2955
02:10:22,620 --> 02:10:23,420
Oh god,

2956
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:34,880
I don't have anything on.

2957
02:11:36,220 --> 02:11:36,620
Oh,

2958
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,230
I did a stun grenade.

2959
02:12:08,370 --> 02:12:08,910
I'm such an idiot.

2960
02:12:09,310 --> 02:12:09,710
Run!

2961
02:12:10,990 --> 02:12:11,230
Oh my god.

2962
02:12:12,650 --> 02:12:13,410
Sorry,

2963
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:20,240
I'm just concentrating really much.

2964
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:21,880
The time, actually.

2965
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:23,240
Even the time.

2966
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:19,300
Oh no, here it comes.

2967
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:21,720
Snake!

2968
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:45,190
Rip it off!

2969
02:13:46,610 --> 02:13:48,130
Gray Fox!

2970
02:13:52,770 --> 02:13:54,630
He was deep-thrown!

2971
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:56,010
He's a terrible snake.

2972
02:13:56,370 --> 02:13:58,110
You haven't aged well.

2973
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:00,750
I'll send you back to hell!

2974
02:14:05,660 --> 02:14:06,620
Gray Fox!

2975
02:14:17,320 --> 02:14:18,400
Fox, why?

2976
02:14:18,540 --> 02:14:20,020
What do you want from me?

2977
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,240
I'm a prisoner of death.

2978
02:14:22,940 --> 02:14:24,660
Only you can free me.

2979
02:14:25,160 --> 02:14:27,000
Fox, stay out of this.

2980
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:28,220
What about Naomi?

2981
02:14:28,500 --> 02:14:30,740
She's hell-bent on taking revenge for you.

2982
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:31,960
Naomi?

2983
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,020
You're the only one who can stop her.

2984
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:36,080
I can.

2985
02:14:36,260 --> 02:14:36,520
Why?

2986
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:39,980
Because I'm the one who killed her parents.

2987
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:46,420
I was young then, and couldn't bring myself to kill her, too.

2988
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:47,940
I felt so.

2989
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:56,100
I raised her like she was my own blood to soothe my guilty conscience.

2990
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:59,560
Even now, she thinks of me as her brother.

2991
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:00,300
What?

2992
02:15:00,630 --> 02:15:04,880
From the outside, we might have seemed like a happy brother and sister.

2993
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:11,740
But every time I looked at her, I saw her parents' eyes staring back at me.

2994
02:15:11,880 --> 02:15:12,900
Tell her for me.

2995
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:16,680
Tell her that I was the one who did it.

2996
02:15:16,920 --> 02:15:18,020
I'll tell her.

2997
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:19,180
I'll definitely tell her.

2998
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:25,300
We're just about out of time.

2999
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:29,220
Here's a final present from Deep Throat.

3000
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:30,000
Oh, yeah.

3001
02:15:30,480 --> 02:15:31,900
I'll stop it from moving.

3002
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:33,780
Fox!

3003
02:15:33,780 --> 02:15:34,960
Fox!

3004
02:15:36,200 --> 02:15:36,800
No!

3005
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:37,460
Who

3006
02:16:07,050 --> 02:16:09,210
is that exoskeleton of yours?

3007
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:09,950
Snake!

3008
02:16:10,230 --> 02:16:13,510
Are you just going to sit by and watch him die?

3009
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:14,590
Oh, boy.

3010
02:16:18,730 --> 02:16:22,610
Gornet Fox is more dangerous than a jackal.

3011
02:16:22,770 --> 02:16:23,170
Yeah!

3012
02:16:24,150 --> 02:16:25,330
Destroyed the ray dome.

3013
02:16:25,590 --> 02:16:26,710
No, I can't do it.

3014
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:28,310
I can't do it.

3015
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:29,550
No, I can't do it.

3016
02:16:30,450 --> 02:16:31,050
Impressive!

3017
02:16:31,230 --> 02:16:34,390
You are indeed worthy of the codename Fox.

3018
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:35,010
I can't do it.

3019
02:16:35,010 --> 02:16:36,570
But now you're finished!

3020
02:16:37,270 --> 02:16:37,850
No!

3021
02:16:38,990 --> 02:16:40,570
Fire the stinger!

3022
02:16:40,970 --> 02:16:41,450
Fox!

3023
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:42,930
Can you really shoot?

3024
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:44,310
You'll kill him too!

3025
02:16:44,710 --> 02:16:45,350
Oh.

3026
02:16:46,770 --> 02:16:47,410
Now!

3027
02:16:48,830 --> 02:16:49,150
I

3028
02:16:55,800 --> 02:16:58,300
was taken from the battle.

3029
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:02,860
Neither truly alive nor truly dead.

3030
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:04,700
I can't do it.

3031
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:05,660
I can't do it.

3032
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:07,240
In a world of light.

3033
02:17:07,320 --> 02:17:07,840
Just put him out.

3034
02:17:07,860 --> 02:17:08,300
Just do it.

3035
02:17:08,400 --> 02:17:09,120
But it's no good.

3036
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:09,800
It's no good.

3037
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:10,420
I can't do it.

3038
02:17:10,440 --> 02:17:14,020
Soon it will finally end.

3039
02:17:16,600 --> 02:17:17,760
No, I can't do it.

3040
02:17:19,880 --> 02:17:21,240
After Zanzibar...

3041
02:17:21,240 --> 02:17:21,780
Die!

3042
02:17:22,720 --> 02:17:23,560
I was...

3043
02:17:26,650 --> 02:17:27,490
No!

3044
02:17:27,830 --> 02:17:31,010
We're not tools of the government or anyone else.

3045
02:17:31,470 --> 02:17:32,150
I love this part.

3046
02:17:32,150 --> 02:17:34,090
Fighting was the only thing.

3047
02:17:34,510 --> 02:17:37,050
The only thing I was good at.

3048
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:42,790
But at least I always fought for what I believed in.

3049
02:17:43,850 --> 02:17:44,370
Speak.

3050
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:46,350
Farewell.

3051
02:17:46,630 --> 02:17:46,790
No.

3052
02:18:08,320 --> 02:18:09,100
Foolish man.

3053
02:18:10,220 --> 02:18:10,740
Death.

3054
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,660
And it found him.

3055
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:15,580
You see?

3056
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:17,300
You can't protect anyone.

3057
02:18:17,600 --> 02:18:19,020
Not even yourself.

3058
02:18:20,420 --> 02:18:20,940
Die!

3059
02:18:22,020 --> 02:18:22,540
Die!

3060
02:18:23,800 --> 02:18:24,320
Okay.

3061
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:25,900
Hey, hey, hey.

3062
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,100
Chill, chill, chill, chill, man.

3063
02:18:27,200 --> 02:18:27,760
Chill, chill, chill.

3064
02:18:28,220 --> 02:18:28,860
All right.

3065
02:18:28,880 --> 02:18:29,160
Hold on.

3066
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,860
I'm hyping myself up.

3067
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:38,500
Mentally.

3068
02:18:38,700 --> 02:18:39,220
No.

3069
02:18:39,260 --> 02:18:39,500
No.

3070
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:39,860
No.

3071
02:18:40,180 --> 02:18:40,300
No.

3072
02:18:43,390 --> 02:18:44,110
Oh, those hit.

3073
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:50,800
Can I get him from here?

3074
02:18:50,900 --> 02:18:51,520
Am I too close?

3075
02:18:52,020 --> 02:18:52,340
Oh.

3076
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:53,060
Ah.

3077
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:53,700
Shit.

3078
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:54,220
I'm too close.

3079
02:18:56,980 --> 02:18:57,300
Ah.

3080
02:18:57,480 --> 02:18:57,800
Shit.

3081
02:18:58,720 --> 02:18:59,360
I didn't miss.

3082
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:00,240
I didn't make it.

3083
02:19:05,480 --> 02:19:05,800
Okay.

3084
02:19:05,940 --> 02:19:06,140
Oh.

3085
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:06,760
Oh.

3086
02:19:06,840 --> 02:19:07,740
I don't know what I'm doing.

3087
02:19:07,800 --> 02:19:08,000
Sorry.

3088
02:19:08,340 --> 02:19:10,300
I'm getting lost in the sauce a little bit, you guys.

3089
02:19:14,080 --> 02:19:15,800
I'm getting lost in the sauce a little bit.

3090
02:19:16,360 --> 02:19:16,680
Okay.

3091
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:17,360
We just got to do the same thing.

3092
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:18,420
But...

3093
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:18,840
Oh my God.

3094
02:19:18,940 --> 02:19:19,580
You're too close?

3095
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:30,230
Ah.

3096
02:19:30,390 --> 02:19:31,210
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

3097
02:19:31,290 --> 02:19:33,330
I thought I had the stun grenades open.

3098
02:19:34,130 --> 02:19:35,390
These do work, right?

3099
02:19:35,670 --> 02:19:36,070
Like...

3100
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:39,070
Okay.

3101
02:19:39,530 --> 02:19:40,150
All right.

3102
02:19:41,610 --> 02:19:42,010
Stop.

3103
02:19:42,190 --> 02:19:43,610
You're not supposed to see me.

3104
02:19:45,750 --> 02:19:46,150
The

3105
02:20:03,740 --> 02:20:05,260
whole stinger to the face.

3106
02:20:05,340 --> 02:20:05,700
It's crazy.

3107
02:20:15,940 --> 02:20:16,940
Shouldn't it be the chaff?

3108
02:20:17,100 --> 02:20:17,320
No.

3109
02:20:17,360 --> 02:20:19,360
It's not the chaff because...

3110
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:20,040
Because...

3111
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:20,360
I don't know.

3112
02:20:20,360 --> 02:20:20,480
I don't know.

3113
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:21,920
It's because the ray doman's done.

3114
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:23,220
Now he's looking with his eyes.

3115
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:25,180
Give

3116
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:09,230
me more rushes.

3117
02:21:11,210 --> 02:21:11,690
Why

3118
02:21:17,280 --> 02:21:18,320
doesn't it work as well?

3119
02:21:27,760 --> 02:21:32,740
Like the chaff is like for sure to work, but this like doesn't.

3120
02:21:32,820 --> 02:21:35,380
I just can't get the timing of it right.

3121
02:21:36,500 --> 02:21:36,980
Ah.

3122
02:21:40,250 --> 02:21:41,210
Chill out.

3123
02:21:42,470 --> 02:21:43,330
You jerk.

3124
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:44,810
Oh.

3125
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:45,110
No.

3126
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:58,500
Oh shit.

3127
02:21:58,560 --> 02:21:59,020
I'm going to die.

3128
02:21:59,240 --> 02:21:59,660
I'm going to...

3129
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:00,000
Oh.

3130
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:00,140
Ah.

3131
02:22:00,280 --> 02:22:00,500
Oh.

3132
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:01,160
Ah.

3133
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:01,220
Ah.

3134
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:01,280
Ah.

3135
02:22:01,740 --> 02:22:01,960
Oh.

3136
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:13,220
This is not it.

3137
02:22:14,220 --> 02:22:14,880
Oh.

3138
02:22:15,720 --> 02:22:16,050
Oh.

3139
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:21,900
This is not it.

3140
02:22:22,240 --> 02:22:23,020
Oh man.

3141
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:24,680
Ah.

3142
02:23:10,370 --> 02:23:11,870
It was close though.

3143
02:23:12,550 --> 02:23:12,730
Snake.

3144
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:13,750
What happened?

3145
02:23:13,950 --> 02:23:14,510
Snake.

3146
02:23:14,510 --> 02:23:14,690
Oh.

3147
02:23:14,890 --> 02:23:15,370
It was close.

3148
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:15,970
Snake.

3149
02:23:16,730 --> 02:23:17,390
Ah.

3150
02:23:18,570 --> 02:23:19,230
Ah.

3151
02:23:20,290 --> 02:23:20,950
Ah.

3152
02:23:22,210 --> 02:23:22,870
Why

3153
02:23:45,640 --> 02:23:52,640
are his eyes so much better like than... than... when he's using the... the VR, huh?

3154
02:23:52,660 --> 02:23:53,900
That's my question.

3155
02:23:57,080 --> 02:23:58,440
Why do his eyes work...

3156
02:23:58,440 --> 02:23:58,600
Oh.

3157
02:23:58,600 --> 02:23:58,940
Hello?

3158
02:23:59,820 --> 02:24:00,520
Oh my god.

3159
02:24:00,520 --> 02:24:01,420
I just put down a C4.

3160
02:24:01,580 --> 02:24:02,460
I'm such an idiot.

3161
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:04,160
I thought...

3162
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:04,500
Wait.

3163
02:24:04,520 --> 02:24:05,340
Did I even throw this?

3164
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:07,860
Why do his eyes work better?

3165
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:09,540
When he's...

3166
02:24:10,760 --> 02:24:11,660
When he's eye...

3167
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:12,640
He was inside the thing.

3168
02:24:13,360 --> 02:24:14,220
180 IQ.

3169
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:15,520
I guess so.

3170
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:16,940
I guess so.

3171
02:24:18,360 --> 02:24:18,800
I guess so.

3172
02:24:19,460 --> 02:24:20,180
I guess so.

3173
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:21,760
I guess so.

3174
02:24:22,180 --> 02:24:22,620
I guess so.

3175
02:24:22,660 --> 02:24:23,380
Oh

3176
02:24:33,490 --> 02:24:33,770
my god.

3177
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:34,230
I just realized.

3178
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:35,990
Question.

3179
02:24:37,530 --> 02:24:37,930
Ah!

3180
02:24:38,110 --> 02:24:40,010
Ouchie ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch.

3181
02:24:40,890 --> 02:24:41,710
Ouchie ouch ouch ouch.

3182
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:42,670
Um.

3183
02:25:02,300 --> 02:25:05,420
Like this part, I can pretty much get down easy.

3184
02:25:11,890 --> 02:25:12,410
Ouchie ouch.

3185
02:25:12,510 --> 02:25:13,130
I say that.

3186
02:25:13,230 --> 02:25:13,750
I should...

3187
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:14,030
Hold on.

3188
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:14,970
Um.

3189
02:25:15,110 --> 02:25:16,630
As soon as I shoot this...

3190
02:25:17,310 --> 02:25:17,990
I'm gonna...

3191
02:25:20,170 --> 02:25:21,690
I'm gonna put on the body armor.

3192
02:25:21,870 --> 02:25:22,090
I'm...

3193
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:22,790
Or I'm gonna heal.

3194
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:24,910
Put on the body armor instead.

3195
02:25:26,230 --> 02:25:26,830
Did I...

3196
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:26,890
Did I...

3197
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:27,870
Should I throw another shaft?

3198
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:29,470
If not, it's just...

3199
02:25:59,540 --> 02:26:01,160
I'm just gonna throw another one just in case.

3200
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:06,900
Okay.

3201
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:08,640
Let's do it.

3202
02:26:20,480 --> 02:26:20,960
Yeah.

3203
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:22,380
Respect people's boundaries.

3204
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:23,240
Exactly.

3205
02:26:29,210 --> 02:26:30,910
Try getting behind him in phase two.

3206
02:26:32,150 --> 02:26:33,170
Does that actually work?

3207
02:26:34,850 --> 02:26:35,330
Try.

3208
02:26:38,550 --> 02:26:39,150
Oh wait.

3209
02:26:39,170 --> 02:26:39,990
I'm gonna skip this.

3210
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:40,410
I'm sorry.

3211
02:26:40,910 --> 02:26:41,810
Cause this is the...

3212
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:42,010
I'm sorry.

3213
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:44,310
In front of you.

3214
02:26:55,540 --> 02:26:56,340
No accident.

3215
02:26:58,140 --> 02:26:58,940
An undying.

3216
02:26:59,220 --> 02:26:59,620
Shadow.

3217
02:27:00,300 --> 02:27:01,660
In a world of...

3218
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,300
This phase two always gets me, man.

3219
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:27,880
Look at him up there in the corner.

3220
02:27:29,860 --> 02:27:30,260
Ugh.

3221
02:28:19,590 --> 02:28:20,790
I haven't even made a single hit.

3222
02:28:20,930 --> 02:28:21,370
You guys.

3223
02:28:22,990 --> 02:28:23,390
How

3224
02:28:55,580 --> 02:28:55,980
do I get to him?

3225
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:56,340
Oh no.

3226
02:28:56,360 --> 02:28:56,840
How do I get to him?

3227
02:28:58,420 --> 02:28:58,820
Hey.

3228
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:00,740
Turn around, idiot.

3229
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:02,500
Don't

3230
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:57,870
look for me.

3231
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:58,650
I'm a lost cause.

3232
02:29:58,970 --> 02:29:59,830
Don't look for me.

3233
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:01,070
Don't look for me.

3234
02:30:01,070 --> 02:30:01,190
No.

3235
02:30:02,730 --> 02:30:03,530
Thank you guys!

3236
02:30:03,970 --> 02:30:04,630
I remember.

3237
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:05,670
Oh, shoot.

3238
02:30:06,210 --> 02:30:06,930
Don't look for me.

3239
02:30:07,210 --> 02:30:08,030
Don't look for me.

3240
02:30:08,230 --> 02:30:09,550
Why does he just stand there?

3241
02:30:59,560 --> 02:31:01,800
When you think of it that way, it's so much easier.

3242
02:31:19,860 --> 02:31:20,700
You're gonna crush me!

3243
02:31:24,100 --> 02:31:26,140
Wait, I think I'm facing... oh no, I'm facing the right way.

3244
02:31:39,360 --> 02:31:40,520
Don't see me, don't see me, don't see me.

3245
02:31:40,860 --> 02:31:41,520
Yeah, you don't know.

3246
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:53,530
Don't get crushed, don't get crushed, Snake.

3247
02:31:54,650 --> 02:31:55,710
Go between his legs.

3248
02:32:00,300 --> 02:32:00,940
He's antsy.

3249
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:02,420
He is antsy.

3250
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:02,580
Come

3251
02:32:05,860 --> 02:32:06,380
on, come on.

3252
02:32:06,380 --> 02:32:06,780
Right here.

3253
02:32:07,300 --> 02:32:08,040
I'm gonna try it.

3254
02:32:10,530 --> 02:32:10,850
Nice!

3255
02:32:12,070 --> 02:32:12,390
Well,

3256
02:32:56,960 --> 02:32:58,060
he lost track of me anyway.

3257
02:32:58,820 --> 02:32:59,660
What a dummy.

3258
02:32:59,940 --> 02:33:00,820
Oh, there we go.

3259
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:01,320
Okay.

3260
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:04,420
Okay, maybe I can get it in, maybe I can get it in.

3261
02:33:12,670 --> 02:33:14,530
You're too close, you're too much on me, okay?

3262
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:15,430
You're too obsessed with me.

3263
02:33:15,670 --> 02:33:16,270
I'm telling you.

3264
02:33:21,490 --> 02:33:22,590
Oh my god, oh my god.

3265
02:33:23,070 --> 02:33:24,630
Could you not do that?

3266
02:33:26,790 --> 02:33:27,790
Sir, stun gun.

3267
02:33:28,410 --> 02:33:29,010
Stun gun!

3268
02:33:30,850 --> 02:33:31,570
Stun... gun!

3269
02:33:34,250 --> 02:33:35,670
Stop walking backwards.

3270
02:33:36,670 --> 02:33:37,450
Okay, I'm turning it.

3271
02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:42,250
Oh my god, don't blow it up, don't blow it up, don't blow it up.

3272
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:44,990
Don't blow it up.

3273
02:33:45,190 --> 02:33:45,390
Stop.

3274
02:33:45,590 --> 02:33:46,510
Stop, Liquid, stop.

3275
02:33:46,770 --> 02:33:47,750
Stop, Liquid, you're gonna blow it up.

3276
02:33:47,770 --> 02:33:49,770
Stop, I'm right here, right here.

3277
02:33:50,090 --> 02:33:50,470
Please.

3278
02:33:54,210 --> 02:33:55,210
Please, Liquid, please.

3279
02:33:55,770 --> 02:33:56,710
Please, Liquid, please.

3280
02:33:56,910 --> 02:33:58,090
You're being too erratic.

3281
02:33:58,150 --> 02:33:59,230
You're scaring me, you're scaring me.

3282
02:34:02,070 --> 02:34:03,970
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

3283
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,660
Ouch.

3284
02:34:09,660 --> 02:34:10,240
Ouchy, ouchy.

3285
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:11,140
It's okay.

3286
02:34:11,260 --> 02:34:11,700
Oh, gosh.

3287
02:34:11,900 --> 02:34:12,920
Wait, maybe it's not okay.

3288
02:34:22,150 --> 02:34:23,190
No, you don't.

3289
02:34:23,190 --> 02:34:23,870
No, you don't.

3290
02:34:23,870 --> 02:34:24,630
No, you don't.

3291
02:34:25,030 --> 02:34:25,950
No, you don't.

3292
02:34:28,050 --> 02:34:29,030
You don't see me.

3293
02:34:29,090 --> 02:34:29,550
I'm a ghost!

3294
02:34:46,570 --> 02:34:47,850
I'll crush you into dust.

3295
02:34:54,690 --> 02:34:56,210
How could she miss?

3296
02:35:27,870 --> 02:35:33,050
Come grab me, brother.

3297
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:37,110
Oh, panties.

3298
02:35:37,170 --> 02:35:37,370
No!

3299
02:35:41,570 --> 02:35:42,670
Oh my god.

3300
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:44,610
How are you still alive?

3301
02:35:45,150 --> 02:35:45,810
How?

3302
02:35:46,030 --> 02:35:47,530
You've taken so many...

3303
02:35:48,070 --> 02:35:50,710
So many stinger missiles to the butt.

3304
02:35:51,250 --> 02:35:54,270
I was gonna say to the face, but I literally went underneath you.

3305
02:35:55,130 --> 02:35:55,830
Wow, the stack.

3306
02:35:55,930 --> 02:35:56,710
Thanks for the 10 gifted.

3307
02:35:59,570 --> 02:36:01,230
What do you mean, like, as usual?

3308
02:36:01,430 --> 02:36:02,130
You don't know me.

3309
02:36:05,070 --> 02:36:05,750
Okay, good.

3310
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:06,550
I can eat some more.

3311
02:36:12,130 --> 02:36:13,950
Guys, I got it in three tries.

3312
02:36:13,950 --> 02:36:14,950
Fighting.

3313
02:36:15,350 --> 02:36:16,950
What are you really after?

3314
02:36:17,170 --> 02:36:19,970
A world where warriors like us are honored as we once were?

3315
02:36:19,970 --> 02:36:23,030
The length of this stream is how long it used to take me.

3316
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:23,290
Actually, it should be.

3317
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:25,230
That was Big Boss's fantasy.

3318
02:36:25,510 --> 02:36:26,270
It was his dying wish.

3319
02:36:26,270 --> 02:36:26,270
Oh, wait.

3320
02:36:26,270 --> 02:36:27,130
Thank you for the fantasy.

3321
02:36:27,750 --> 02:36:33,510
When he was young, during the Cold War, the world needed men like us.

3322
02:36:33,950 --> 02:36:36,030
We were valued then.

3323
02:36:36,090 --> 02:36:37,110
We were desired.

3324
02:36:37,970 --> 02:36:40,990
But things, oh, are different now.

3325
02:36:40,990 --> 02:36:41,630
We were desired.

3326
02:36:41,630 --> 02:36:42,510
I'm still desired.

3327
02:36:42,510 --> 02:36:43,610
What are you talking about?

3328
02:36:43,610 --> 02:36:45,110
We're hypocrites running the world.

3329
02:36:45,310 --> 02:36:47,730
War isn't what it used to be.

3330
02:36:47,970 --> 02:36:48,710
War has changed.

3331
02:36:48,770 --> 02:36:52,370
We are losing our place in a world that no longer needs us.

3332
02:36:52,670 --> 02:36:56,010
A world that now spurs our very existence.

3333
02:36:56,970 --> 02:36:57,450
Big Chunkus, do you know Big Chunkus?

3334
02:36:57,450 --> 02:36:59,350
You should know that as well as I do.

3335
02:37:00,290 --> 02:37:05,970
After I launch this weapon and get our billion dollars, we'll be able to bring chaos and honor back to this world.

3336
02:37:05,970 --> 02:37:08,650
You think they'd stop making these metal gear machines after a show time and time again?

3337
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:09,130
One man.

3338
02:37:09,250 --> 02:37:11,090
Or one maid can take them out.

3339
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,310
All right.

3340
02:37:11,310 --> 02:37:12,290
Conflict will breed conflict.

3341
02:37:12,290 --> 02:37:13,930
New hatred will arise.

3342
02:37:14,270 --> 02:37:18,830
Then, we'll steadily expand our sphere of influence.

3343
02:37:19,330 --> 02:37:22,590
But as long as there are people, there will always be war.

3344
02:37:22,650 --> 02:37:24,670
But the problem is balance.

3345
02:37:25,390 --> 02:37:28,090
Father knew what type of a balance was best.

3346
02:37:28,410 --> 02:37:29,750
Is that the only reason?

3347
02:37:31,470 --> 02:37:35,030
Isn't it reason enough for warriors such as us?

3348
02:37:35,170 --> 02:37:36,490
I don't want that kind of world.

3349
02:37:36,570 --> 02:37:37,830
You lie.

3350
02:37:38,270 --> 02:37:39,890
So why are you here then?

3351
02:37:39,890 --> 02:37:45,250
Why do you continue to follow your orders while your superiors betray you?

3352
02:37:45,630 --> 02:37:47,210
Why did you come here?

3353
02:37:48,990 --> 02:37:51,150
Well, I'll tell you then.

3354
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:54,190
You enjoy the killing.

3355
02:37:55,170 --> 02:37:55,750
What?

3356
02:37:55,930 --> 02:37:57,210
Are you denying it?

3357
02:37:57,350 --> 02:37:59,670
Haven't you already killed most of my comrades?

3358
02:37:59,690 --> 02:38:01,770
I'm sorry, I can't get the Twin Snakes version out of my head.

3359
02:38:01,950 --> 02:38:04,150
When he's like, up in your face about it.

3360
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:06,310
I watched your face when you did it.

3361
02:38:06,530 --> 02:38:09,330
It was filled with the joy...

3362
02:38:09,330 --> 02:38:10,530
of battle.

3363
02:38:10,770 --> 02:38:11,590
You're wrong.

3364
02:38:12,030 --> 02:38:13,370
There's a killer inside you.

3365
02:38:13,370 --> 02:38:15,750
You don't have to deny it.

3366
02:38:15,950 --> 02:38:18,970
We were created to be that way.

3367
02:38:19,910 --> 02:38:20,550
Created?

3368
02:38:21,530 --> 02:38:24,870
Let's not applause yet though, I still have one more battle.

3369
02:38:28,050 --> 02:38:29,630
Les Enfants Terribles.

3370
02:38:29,890 --> 02:38:31,410
The Terrible Children.

3371
02:38:31,910 --> 02:38:33,730
That's what the project was called.

3372
02:38:34,010 --> 02:38:36,430
It started in the 1970s.

3373
02:38:36,430 --> 02:38:41,150
Their plan was to artificially create the most powerful soldier possible.

3374
02:38:41,610 --> 02:38:48,170
The person that they chose as the model was the man known then as the greatest living soldier in the world.

3375
02:38:48,430 --> 02:38:49,290
Big Boss.

3376
02:38:49,370 --> 02:38:49,710
Big Boss.

3377
02:38:49,910 --> 02:38:53,450
Her father was wounded in combat and already in a coma when they brought him in.

3378
02:38:53,610 --> 02:38:56,190
So they created us from his cells.

3379
02:38:56,570 --> 02:39:01,250
With a combination of 20th century analog cloning and the Super Baby Man.

3380
02:39:01,730 --> 02:39:03,030
Super Baby Man.

3381
02:39:03,250 --> 02:39:06,050
They fertilized an egg with one of father's cells.

3382
02:39:06,050 --> 02:39:09,250
I like how even Snake is just like Super Baby Man.

3383
02:39:09,370 --> 02:39:17,770
Then they transferred the clones to someone's uterus and later intentionally aborted six of the fetuses to encourage strong fetal growth.

3384
02:39:17,990 --> 02:39:18,130
Yeah!

3385
02:39:18,330 --> 02:39:19,470
Eat the fetus!

3386
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:21,130
Eat each other in the womb!

3387
02:39:23,010 --> 02:39:23,550
Sorry.

3388
02:39:26,350 --> 02:39:28,850
I looked like I was going through the Super Baby Method.

3389
02:39:29,290 --> 02:39:29,830
Stop!

3390
02:39:29,830 --> 02:39:31,990
Before the day we were even born.

3391
02:39:33,810 --> 02:39:35,410
So it was you and I.

3392
02:39:36,050 --> 02:39:39,630
Two fertilized eggs with exactly the same DNA.

3393
02:39:40,090 --> 02:39:42,050
Minto, close your legs!

3394
02:39:42,590 --> 02:39:43,210
But they weren't finished yet.

3395
02:39:43,810 --> 02:39:46,090
They used me as a guinea pig.

3396
02:39:46,800 --> 02:39:50,750
To create a phenotype in which all of the dominant genes were expressed.

3397
02:39:50,930 --> 02:39:52,590
To create you.

3398
02:39:52,990 --> 02:39:55,490
I got all of the recessive genes.

3399
02:39:56,350 --> 02:39:57,450
Dot dot dot.

3400
02:39:57,590 --> 02:40:00,010
You took everything from me before I was even born.

3401
02:40:00,130 --> 02:40:00,790
Super Baby Minto.

3402
02:40:01,880 --> 02:40:02,630
Super Baby.

3403
02:40:02,630 --> 02:40:05,510
You and I aren't his only children.

3404
02:40:06,490 --> 02:40:07,170
What?

3405
02:40:07,390 --> 02:40:09,270
The Genome Soldiers.

3406
02:40:09,470 --> 02:40:11,490
They too are his progeny.

3407
02:40:11,490 --> 02:40:13,330
Carrying on his genetic legacy.

3408
02:40:13,330 --> 02:40:13,430
Oh my god.

3409
02:40:13,430 --> 02:40:14,330
Avert your eyes.

3410
02:40:14,610 --> 02:40:16,050
Freak Phantom, stop!

3411
02:40:16,690 --> 02:40:21,290
With the completion of the Human Genome Project, the mysteries of humanity were laid bare.

3412
02:40:21,290 --> 02:40:23,910
Sometimes the sound, the background noise stops, and sometimes it comes back.

3413
02:40:25,770 --> 02:40:26,910
Real footage.

3414
02:40:27,310 --> 02:40:32,210
Thanks to Father's DNA, they were able to identify more than 66...

3415
02:40:32,210 --> 02:40:32,670
That's my dad!

3416
02:40:32,670 --> 02:40:38,990
60 soldier genes responsible for everything from strategic thinking to the proverbial killer instinct.

3417
02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:39,670
Yeah!

3418
02:40:39,910 --> 02:40:45,950
Those soldier genes were transplanted into the members of the next generation's special forces.

3419
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:46,430
Oh, that's my dad!

3420
02:40:46,430 --> 02:40:46,770
There's Naomi!

3421
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:49,510
That's how they became the Genome Soldiers.

3422
02:40:49,550 --> 02:40:49,750
Oh.

3423
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:51,470
That's right.

3424
02:40:51,490 --> 02:40:52,430
Time for the Super Babies part.

3425
02:40:52,430 --> 02:40:55,930
The Genome Soldiers that you've been killing are our brothers.

3426
02:40:55,990 --> 02:40:56,490
Oh my god.

3427
02:40:56,490 --> 02:40:56,510
That's my dad!

3428
02:40:56,510 --> 02:40:58,310
With the same genes as ours.

3429
02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:02,190
That's my dad!

3430
02:41:02,190 --> 02:41:03,110
The Genome Soldiers.

3431
02:41:03,210 --> 02:41:03,990
That's right.

3432
02:41:04,150 --> 02:41:05,710
They are our brothers.

3433
02:41:05,710 --> 02:41:06,450
I'm so embarrassed.

3434
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:08,590
Stop looking at my spread legs.

3435
02:41:08,770 --> 02:41:10,990
Created artificially through the alignment of nucleotides to mimic our father's genes.

3436
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:14,090
They too are the product of numerous sacrifices.

3437
02:41:15,050 --> 02:41:15,630
Sacrifice?

3438
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:16,930
Human experiments.

3439
02:41:18,090 --> 02:41:19,250
I can't!

3440
02:41:21,490 --> 02:41:22,070
1991.

3441
02:41:22,250 --> 02:41:22,690
The Gulf War.

3442
02:41:22,690 --> 02:41:23,710
I can't pay attention at all.

3443
02:41:24,190 --> 02:41:25,910
I can't pay attention at all.

3444
02:41:26,110 --> 02:41:28,590
The military secretly injected soldiers with the soldier genes.

3445
02:41:28,590 --> 02:41:29,530
Oh my god, it's too funny.

3446
02:41:30,010 --> 02:41:32,170
The Gulf War.

3447
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:38,950
The Gulf War syndrome that hundreds of thousands of returning soldiers complained about was a side effect of it.

3448
02:41:39,010 --> 02:41:39,210
Oh.

3449
02:41:39,370 --> 02:41:39,990
That's me.

3450
02:41:40,130 --> 02:41:45,470
Everyone knows that the Gulf War syndrome was caused by exposure to depleted uranium used in the anti-tank rounds.

3451
02:41:45,530 --> 02:41:45,850
Super Babies.

3452
02:41:45,850 --> 02:41:46,010
Babies.

3453
02:41:46,010 --> 02:41:46,510
Baby juice.

3454
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:50,750
That was just a cover story issued by the Pentagon.

3455
02:41:51,090 --> 02:41:51,270
Whoa.

3456
02:41:52,070 --> 02:41:55,090
First they tried to say it was post-traumatic stress disorder.

3457
02:41:55,210 --> 02:41:55,570
Look how fast he's going.

3458
02:41:55,790 --> 02:41:58,010
Then chemical or biological weapons.

3459
02:41:58,390 --> 02:42:00,410
The poison gas detection units.

3460
02:42:00,410 --> 02:42:01,090
Starting your dominance on me.

3461
02:42:01,090 --> 02:42:02,490
And the anti-serine injections.

3462
02:42:02,910 --> 02:42:06,590
They were all just a cover-up of the secret genetic experiments.

3463
02:42:06,970 --> 02:42:07,510
Money for pants.

3464
02:42:07,530 --> 02:42:12,750
So then, the so-called Gulf War Babies that have been reported by Gulf War veterans are...

3465
02:42:12,750 --> 02:42:13,490
Yes.

3466
02:42:13,650 --> 02:42:14,190
Us.

3467
02:42:14,190 --> 02:42:15,270
They too are...

3468
02:42:15,270 --> 02:42:15,790
The brothers.

3469
02:42:15,870 --> 02:42:17,110
Our brothers and sisters.

3470
02:42:17,110 --> 02:42:18,470
Our brothers and sisters.

3471
02:42:18,550 --> 02:42:21,810
So the genome soldiers mean that the experiments were a success?

3472
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:23,350
Success?

3473
02:42:23,890 --> 02:42:25,010
Don't be a fool.

3474
02:42:25,310 --> 02:42:26,990
They're a complete failure.

3475
02:42:27,650 --> 02:42:30,190
We are on the verge of extinction.

3476
02:42:30,410 --> 02:42:31,070
Oh my god.

3477
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:31,530
No.

3478
02:42:32,310 --> 02:42:34,310
But you have so many genome soldiers here.

3479
02:42:34,610 --> 02:42:36,950
Have you ever heard of the asymmetry theory?

3480
02:42:38,390 --> 02:42:38,930
Huh?

3481
02:42:39,210 --> 02:42:41,450
Nature tends to favor asymmetry.

3482
02:42:41,930 --> 02:42:46,950
Those species which have gone extinct all show signs of symmetry.

3483
02:42:47,330 --> 02:42:50,530
The genome soldiers suffer from the same problem.

3484
02:42:50,550 --> 02:42:50,990
Oh my god.

3485
02:42:51,090 --> 02:42:53,090
This angle.

3486
02:42:53,470 --> 02:42:54,090
I can't.

3487
02:42:54,730 --> 02:42:55,790
So do I.

3488
02:42:55,990 --> 02:42:56,670
As do you.

3489
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:57,570
Oh my god.

3490
02:42:58,250 --> 02:42:58,790
Minto.

3491
02:42:58,890 --> 02:42:59,290
That's right.

3492
02:42:59,670 --> 02:43:01,070
We are all on the verge of extinction.

3493
02:43:01,070 --> 02:43:02,890
We are on the verge of death at the genetic level.

3494
02:43:03,110 --> 02:43:05,970
We don't know when or what type of disease will occur.

3495
02:43:06,350 --> 02:43:09,170
That's why we need the old man's genetic information.

3496
02:43:09,730 --> 02:43:12,970
You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family?

3497
02:43:13,130 --> 02:43:14,130
It's very touching.

3498
02:43:14,490 --> 02:43:19,630
In nature, family members don't mate with each other and yet they help each other to survive.

3499
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:21,010
Do you know why?

3500
02:43:21,410 --> 02:43:22,930
I think sometimes they mate with each other.

3501
02:43:22,930 --> 02:43:26,030
It increases the chance that their genes will be passed on to a new generation.

3502
02:43:26,770 --> 02:43:30,810
Altruism among blood relatives is a response to natural selection.

3503
02:43:30,830 --> 02:43:31,050
It doesn't stop me.

3504
02:43:31,050 --> 02:43:35,670
It's the giant, like, horn coming out of... that's, like, censoring everything.

3505
02:43:46,310 --> 02:43:46,830
Jeans!

3506
02:43:46,830 --> 02:43:47,230
Jeans!

3507
02:43:47,250 --> 02:43:47,770
Jeans!

3508
02:43:48,690 --> 02:43:49,210
Jeans!

3509
02:43:50,330 --> 02:43:52,790
Don't take a shot every time he says jeans, you guys.

3510
02:43:52,830 --> 02:43:53,270
You'll die.

3511
02:43:54,270 --> 02:43:57,630
In order to break the curse of my heritage.

3512
02:43:59,490 --> 02:44:01,290
At least her shirt is still on.

3513
02:44:05,060 --> 02:44:08,790
And to do that, first, I will kill you.

3514
02:44:08,930 --> 02:44:09,150
No!

3515
02:44:12,010 --> 02:44:12,630
Okay.

3516
02:44:14,350 --> 02:44:15,810
Look behind you.

3517
02:44:17,590 --> 02:44:18,210
Merle!

3518
02:44:18,510 --> 02:44:18,950
Merle!

3519
02:44:19,990 --> 02:44:21,030
Is she alive?

3520
02:44:21,330 --> 02:44:22,190
I'm not sure.

3521
02:44:22,290 --> 02:44:23,230
She was alive.

3522
02:44:23,270 --> 02:44:24,550
She was alive a few hours ago.

3523
02:44:24,690 --> 02:44:25,150
Oh, boy.

3524
02:44:25,650 --> 02:44:27,990
Poor girl kept calling your name.

3525
02:44:28,170 --> 02:44:28,530
Oh, no.

3526
02:44:28,830 --> 02:44:29,090
Merle.

3527
02:44:29,390 --> 02:44:30,550
Stupid woman.

3528
02:44:31,030 --> 02:44:34,070
Falling in love with a man who doesn't even have a name.

3529
02:44:34,070 --> 02:44:34,990
I have a name.

3530
02:44:35,130 --> 02:44:37,490
No, we have no past.

3531
02:44:37,570 --> 02:44:38,230
No future.

3532
02:44:38,650 --> 02:44:41,290
And even if we did, it wouldn't be truly ours.

3533
02:44:41,610 --> 02:44:45,230
You and I are just copies of our father, Big Boss.

3534
02:44:45,490 --> 02:44:46,390
Let Merle go.

3535
02:44:46,670 --> 02:44:48,670
As soon as we've finished our business.

3536
02:44:49,050 --> 02:44:50,490
We're almost out of time.

3537
02:44:51,010 --> 02:44:52,190
We're talking about foxtie.

3538
02:44:52,570 --> 02:44:53,030
Whoa.

3539
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:57,090
It seems now that the Pentagon knows that Metal Gear is destroyed.

3540
02:44:57,130 --> 02:44:57,890
That was so fast.

3541
02:44:57,950 --> 02:44:59,110
They've arrived at a decision.

3542
02:44:59,110 --> 02:45:00,750
How do they know that Metal Gear is destroyed?

3543
02:45:00,750 --> 02:45:02,550
Also, I'm huge next to him.

3544
02:45:02,650 --> 02:45:02,770
Look at this.

3545
02:45:02,770 --> 02:45:06,210
If you want the details, why don't you ask your precious Colonel Campbell?

3546
02:45:06,210 --> 02:45:06,910
I look like...

3547
02:45:06,910 --> 02:45:08,830
I look like I'm like...

3548
02:45:10,630 --> 02:45:12,130
Colonel, can you hear me?

3549
02:45:12,390 --> 02:45:12,870
Yes.

3550
02:45:12,930 --> 02:45:13,470
I'm listening.

3551
02:45:13,690 --> 02:45:15,450
What is the Pentagon trying to do?

3552
02:45:15,470 --> 02:45:16,150
I'm so mad.

3553
02:45:16,190 --> 02:45:17,530
Colonel, answer me.

3554
02:45:17,650 --> 02:45:21,370
The Secretary of Defense has taken over active control of this operation.

3555
02:45:21,890 --> 02:45:23,250
He's on his way there by now.

3556
02:45:23,250 --> 02:45:24,390
A wax.

3557
02:45:24,670 --> 02:45:24,890
What for?

3558
02:45:25,230 --> 02:45:26,450
To bomb the place.

3559
02:45:26,550 --> 02:45:26,830
No.

3560
02:45:26,910 --> 02:45:27,370
What?

3561
02:45:27,510 --> 02:45:28,490
Not only that.

3562
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:32,310
B-2 bombers just lifted off from Galena Air Force Base.

3563
02:45:32,590 --> 02:45:33,550
Why didn't you stop though?

3564
02:45:33,550 --> 02:45:37,650
They're carrying B-61-13 surface piercing tactical nuclear bombs.

3565
02:45:37,930 --> 02:45:38,170
A wax.

3566
02:45:38,650 --> 02:45:39,970
Metal gear is destroyed.

3567
02:45:40,430 --> 02:45:42,130
Tell the Secretary of Defense.

3568
02:45:42,430 --> 02:45:47,730
The Secretary of Defense heard that Naomi double-crossed us and he's worried about Fox dying.

3569
02:45:47,730 --> 02:45:48,730
Will Peter Saul drinking him?

3570
02:45:48,810 --> 02:45:51,730
Now that there's no more danger of a nuclear strike from Metal Gear.

3571
02:45:51,970 --> 02:45:53,230
He's going to do whatever he wants.

3572
02:46:02,630 --> 02:46:07,090
Okay, I trust you.

3573
02:46:08,190 --> 02:46:12,230
Not anymore.

3574
02:46:13,630 --> 02:46:15,030
Okay.

3575
02:46:19,910 --> 02:46:20,610
Okay.

3576
02:46:23,230 --> 02:46:24,190
It's okay, Snake.

3577
02:46:25,070 --> 02:46:29,870
The truth is, Foxhound was already the subject of an undercover investigation.

3578
02:46:31,070 --> 02:46:36,330
Meryl was transferred to this base just before the terrorist attack as a way of manipulating me.

3579
02:46:36,550 --> 02:46:37,610
Okay, I believe you.

3580
02:46:37,810 --> 02:46:38,510
Those bastards.

3581
02:46:39,190 --> 02:46:39,690
Those bastards.

3582
02:46:39,690 --> 02:46:40,150
I'm sorry.

3583
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:43,750
They forced me to cooperate in exchange for her life.

3584
02:46:44,610 --> 02:46:45,990
You better get out of there, Snake.

3585
02:46:46,770 --> 02:46:47,710
Are you sure?

3586
02:46:48,190 --> 02:46:49,350
It'll be bad for you.

3587
02:46:49,490 --> 02:46:49,690
They forced you, Colonel?

3588
02:46:49,690 --> 02:46:50,710
You could have told me at any time.

3589
02:46:50,890 --> 02:46:52,490
It's the least I can do for you.

3590
02:46:53,230 --> 02:46:53,870
After all the lies.

3591
02:46:54,450 --> 02:46:55,010
Colonel.

3592
02:46:55,510 --> 02:46:58,050
I'm ordering them to cancel the bombing run.

3593
02:46:58,470 --> 02:46:59,030
Cancel!

3594
02:46:59,090 --> 02:46:59,310
Cancel!

3595
02:46:59,310 --> 02:47:00,390
After that, there's no turning back.

3596
02:47:00,590 --> 02:47:02,550
What are you doing?

3597
02:47:03,050 --> 02:47:03,610
Colonel!

3598
02:47:04,350 --> 02:47:05,110
Uh-oh.

3599
02:47:05,250 --> 02:47:05,570
Snake!

3600
02:47:05,830 --> 02:47:07,930
Mei-Ling, what happened to the Colonel?

3601
02:47:08,210 --> 02:47:09,010
I don't believe it.

3602
02:47:09,130 --> 02:47:10,090
What happened?

3603
02:47:10,410 --> 02:47:11,370
Snake, the Colonel!

3604
02:47:12,730 --> 02:47:15,610
Roy Campbell has been relieved of duty.

3605
02:47:16,270 --> 02:47:16,830
She grew a beard!

3606
02:47:16,830 --> 02:47:18,170
This is the Secretary of Defense.

3607
02:47:18,190 --> 02:47:19,070
Jim, how...

3608
02:47:19,070 --> 02:47:21,030
We'll put the Colonel back on.

3609
02:47:21,270 --> 02:47:23,130
He's been placed under arrest.

3610
02:47:23,230 --> 02:47:25,670
For leaking top secret information.

3611
02:47:26,250 --> 02:47:27,570
Abraham Lincoln.

3612
02:47:27,930 --> 02:47:28,710
And for the crime of high treason.

3613
02:47:29,270 --> 02:47:29,910
Ridiculous.

3614
02:47:30,530 --> 02:47:32,910
Yes, he's a ridiculous man.

3615
02:47:32,970 --> 02:47:34,750
Oh, I can't wait for that Metal Gear guy.

3616
02:47:34,990 --> 02:47:35,910
Ridiculous man.

3617
02:47:36,550 --> 02:47:37,070
He truly believed the names in command of this operation.

3618
02:47:37,070 --> 02:47:37,890
Hot Cold Man.

3619
02:47:38,110 --> 02:47:39,170
Jim House Man.

3620
02:47:39,410 --> 02:47:41,290
Real Ridiculous Man.

3621
02:47:41,750 --> 02:47:42,710
There won't be a speck of evidence left.

3622
02:47:43,310 --> 02:47:46,410
I'm sure the President would want the same thing.

3623
02:47:47,270 --> 02:47:48,430
The President ordered this?

3624
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:50,710
The President is a busy man.

3625
02:47:50,890 --> 02:47:52,850
The President is a busy man.

3626
02:47:54,410 --> 02:47:55,830
Die hard Man.

3627
02:47:56,270 --> 02:47:58,030
Running Man.

3628
02:47:59,790 --> 02:48:00,910
BoJack Horseman.

3629
02:48:05,450 --> 02:48:06,010
Smart.

3630
02:48:10,590 --> 02:48:11,890
Don't compliment him.

3631
02:48:12,150 --> 02:48:14,350
The scientists, the Genome Army.

3632
02:48:14,850 --> 02:48:15,410
Everyone...

3633
02:48:15,410 --> 02:48:16,050
Donald.

3634
02:48:16,070 --> 02:48:16,930
He's thinking of the scientists.

3635
02:48:17,330 --> 02:48:18,750
The DARPA chief is already dead.

3636
02:48:19,390 --> 02:48:20,610
Who could you be thinking of?

3637
02:48:20,630 --> 02:48:22,210
So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA chief after all.

3638
02:48:22,210 --> 02:48:22,770
The house is in place.

3639
02:48:22,910 --> 02:48:24,870
Can't be under house arrest.

3640
02:48:40,550 --> 02:48:41,670
See ya!

3641
02:48:48,330 --> 02:48:51,070
I hate how mean everybody is to them.

3642
02:48:52,550 --> 02:48:54,850
You can't be allowed to live.

3643
02:48:55,150 --> 02:49:01,250
Well, the bombs will be dropping soon and you two have a lot of catching up to do.

3644
02:49:01,970 --> 02:49:03,210
They're so mean.

3645
02:49:03,210 --> 02:49:03,590
Farewell.

3646
02:49:03,890 --> 02:49:05,870
It's not like they asked to be born like this.

3647
02:49:06,250 --> 02:49:07,430
They're so mean.

3648
02:49:08,670 --> 02:49:10,830
There's no way out for us.

3649
02:49:12,810 --> 02:49:14,970
We gotta duke it out.

3650
02:49:15,070 --> 02:49:17,350
Let's finish this before the air strike.

3651
02:49:17,770 --> 02:49:18,110
Oh boy.

3652
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:20,770
This is the part I'm scared of too.

3653
02:49:20,950 --> 02:49:21,370
Hahaha.

3654
02:49:22,210 --> 02:49:23,990
I think since Vulcan Raven I've been scared of.

3655
02:49:24,590 --> 02:49:25,030
Hahaha.

3656
02:49:34,170 --> 02:49:35,730
Stop looking at her like that.

3657
02:49:35,930 --> 02:49:36,550
You weirdo.

3658
02:49:43,820 --> 02:49:45,020
Which ending are we getting?

3659
02:49:45,160 --> 02:49:45,740
I'll be honest.

3660
02:49:46,220 --> 02:49:47,120
I don't know.

3661
02:49:49,360 --> 02:49:51,000
I honestly have no idea.

3662
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:57,100
This nuclear module is set to detonate at the precise moment of her death.

3663
02:49:57,420 --> 02:49:57,560
No!

3664
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,480
Well, then she won't die.

3665
02:50:01,960 --> 02:50:06,840
I was aiming for the Meryl ending because, you know, it's the canonic canon.

3666
02:50:06,880 --> 02:50:07,820
Oh, no, no, no.

3667
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:10,320
If you win, you might still be able to say that.

3668
02:50:10,320 --> 02:50:10,520
Turn on!

3669
02:50:10,700 --> 02:50:11,920
My controller turned off.

3670
02:50:13,380 --> 02:50:18,600
You could enjoy one brief moment of love before the end.

3671
02:50:20,380 --> 02:50:20,980
Okay, we're good.

3672
02:50:20,980 --> 02:50:23,680
If you cross this line, you'll fall.

3673
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:24,540
Yeah.

3674
02:50:24,640 --> 02:50:27,680
At this height, it will kill even you.

3675
02:50:27,920 --> 02:50:28,740
Even you.

3676
02:50:30,240 --> 02:50:30,720
Okay.

3677
02:50:31,860 --> 02:50:32,500
Come on.

3678
02:50:32,520 --> 02:50:33,880
Let me fight him already, please.

3679
02:50:34,540 --> 02:50:35,900
Why did they even start...

3680
02:50:35,900 --> 02:50:36,340
Have at you, Snake.

3681
02:50:36,680 --> 02:50:39,140
Why did they even start it at a...

3682
02:50:39,140 --> 02:50:39,700
Oh.

3683
02:50:56,430 --> 02:50:57,390
Oh, Snake.

3684
02:50:57,730 --> 02:50:58,490
Don't charge.

3685
02:50:59,710 --> 02:51:00,190
Yeah.

3686
02:51:01,050 --> 02:51:02,810
What's wrong, Snake?

3687
02:51:02,910 --> 02:51:03,650
Oh, shoot.

3688
02:51:03,810 --> 02:51:04,210
Yeah.

3689
02:51:04,250 --> 02:51:04,770
I got him.

3690
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:05,250
I got him.

3691
02:51:05,290 --> 02:51:05,350
No.

3692
02:51:05,450 --> 02:51:05,670
No.

3693
02:51:05,670 --> 02:51:06,510
I got him.

3694
02:51:14,630 --> 02:51:14,990
Yeah.

3695
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:15,670
Try running.

3696
02:51:16,190 --> 02:51:16,550
Oh!

3697
02:51:16,670 --> 02:51:17,390
Why did I do that?

3698
02:51:17,470 --> 02:51:18,150
Why did I do that?

3699
02:51:20,510 --> 02:51:20,870
Ouch.

3700
02:51:21,530 --> 02:51:22,070
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3701
02:51:23,650 --> 02:51:25,490
Why does he hit so much more than me?

3702
02:51:25,550 --> 02:51:26,070
So unfair.

3703
02:51:27,650 --> 02:51:28,170
Come on.

3704
02:51:28,210 --> 02:51:28,930
Oh, dang.

3705
02:51:29,010 --> 02:51:29,410
That was my...

3706
02:51:29,850 --> 02:51:31,890
That was my shot when he started running around.

3707
02:51:33,210 --> 02:51:34,110
No, no.

3708
02:51:34,410 --> 02:51:35,190
I won't let you.

3709
02:51:35,390 --> 02:51:35,650
Yeah.

3710
02:51:37,590 --> 02:51:37,950
Yeah.

3711
02:51:39,490 --> 02:51:39,950
Don't charge.

3712
02:51:40,350 --> 02:51:40,990
Don't charge.

3713
02:51:41,230 --> 02:51:42,230
Why did I do that?

3714
02:51:42,250 --> 02:51:42,490
Why did I do that?

3715
02:51:49,590 --> 02:51:51,750
There's not a good way for me to... Oh my god!

3716
02:51:52,150 --> 02:51:52,550
Please!

3717
02:51:52,690 --> 02:51:56,700
I don't think I can under... I don't think I...

3718
02:51:57,640 --> 02:51:58,380
Oh my god!

3719
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:03,380
I think the size is actually maybe throwing me off a little bit because I'm like kind of huge.

3720
02:52:04,620 --> 02:52:05,420
You know?

3721
02:52:15,400 --> 02:52:16,240
Don't charge at me.

3722
02:52:16,960 --> 02:52:18,640
I tried to avoid it.

3723
02:52:22,480 --> 02:52:23,040
Ouch!

3724
02:52:23,240 --> 02:52:24,240
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

3725
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:27,760
Don't charge at me.

3726
02:52:29,080 --> 02:52:29,640
Yeah.

3727
02:52:49,290 --> 02:52:50,850
No one cries for me.

3728
02:52:51,430 --> 02:52:53,370
What if Liquid's just really short?

3729
02:52:53,930 --> 02:52:54,730
Short king.

3730
02:52:56,970 --> 02:52:57,530
Okay.

3731
02:53:00,950 --> 02:53:02,550
These stupid eye frames.

3732
02:53:05,050 --> 02:53:05,610
Okay.

3733
02:53:07,820 --> 02:53:08,380
Oh!

3734
02:53:25,120 --> 02:53:26,600
Running away, are you?

3735
02:53:26,960 --> 02:53:28,400
You coward brother...

3736
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:33,370
I hate...

3737
02:53:36,170 --> 02:53:37,390
This isn't CQC.

3738
02:53:37,410 --> 02:53:38,470
This is unfairness.

3739
02:53:38,870 --> 02:53:41,830
Why does he hit like three times harder than I do?

3740
02:53:42,850 --> 02:53:44,530
What's wrong, Snake?

3741
02:53:45,370 --> 02:53:46,910
You hit too hard!

3742
02:53:47,270 --> 02:53:48,270
That's what's wrong.

3743
02:53:48,470 --> 02:53:49,850
That's my problem, man.

3744
02:53:50,050 --> 02:53:51,230
That's my problem.

3745
02:53:51,650 --> 02:53:53,610
Why did that not hit you at all?

3746
02:53:57,810 --> 02:53:59,770
Why can I only get one-hitted?

3747
02:54:00,810 --> 02:54:01,270
Yeah.

3748
02:54:01,670 --> 02:54:03,230
What's wrong, Snake?

3749
02:54:03,310 --> 02:54:04,170
You're the one running!

3750
02:54:04,590 --> 02:54:05,330
Nice shot!

3751
02:54:05,830 --> 02:54:06,290
Hurry!

3752
02:54:10,060 --> 02:54:11,400
It's going to blow!

3753
02:54:11,960 --> 02:54:13,340
Oh my god.

3754
02:54:13,500 --> 02:54:14,340
What's wrong, Snake?

3755
02:54:14,340 --> 02:54:16,700
Why did you charge at me twice in a row?

3756
02:54:18,260 --> 02:54:18,720
What?!

3757
02:54:23,880 --> 02:54:25,140
Oh my god!

3758
02:54:26,380 --> 02:54:28,560
You guys, this will be the longest fight, I think.

3759
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:30,420
This is... I don't even think I know.

3760
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:32,860
I know this is going to be...

3761
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:36,600
This is the longest... This is always the one that gets me.

3762
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:38,520
Well, I say that.

3763
02:54:40,620 --> 02:54:41,900
This feels so unfair.

3764
02:54:42,100 --> 02:54:42,640
I know, right?

3765
02:54:42,700 --> 02:54:43,600
It really is.

3766
02:54:43,740 --> 02:54:45,360
It's literally just a get good.

3767
02:54:45,580 --> 02:54:48,240
But he has so... His eye frames last forever.

3768
02:54:50,500 --> 02:54:52,420
I think there's a way to like...

3769
02:54:53,100 --> 02:54:56,680
There's a way to like pin him and like get him kind of... Hello?

3770
02:54:56,820 --> 02:54:57,360
Go up?

3771
02:54:57,500 --> 02:54:59,020
Kind of get him in like a...

3772
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:02,920
In like a one-two, one-two, one-two, you know?

3773
02:55:07,300 --> 02:55:07,740
Yeah.

3774
02:55:09,160 --> 02:55:10,020
But I just...

3775
02:55:13,700 --> 02:55:14,580
But he...

3776
02:55:14,580 --> 02:55:15,400
One-two.

3777
02:55:16,180 --> 02:55:17,160
Yeah, that's right.

3778
02:55:17,280 --> 02:55:17,620
Oh, oh.

3779
02:55:18,820 --> 02:55:19,540
One-two.

3780
02:55:23,400 --> 02:55:24,060
One-two.

3781
02:55:24,640 --> 02:55:25,080
Yeah.

3782
02:55:26,780 --> 02:55:28,040
I'm not doing enough damage.

3783
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:29,820
This sucks, man.

3784
02:55:29,860 --> 02:55:30,820
This sucks so much.

3785
02:55:31,660 --> 02:55:32,100
Ugh.

3786
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:33,860
Yeah.

3787
02:55:34,020 --> 02:55:34,680
Oh, oh.

3788
02:55:34,940 --> 02:55:35,860
And I'm huge.

3789
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:37,600
Are you gonna dodge it?

3790
02:55:38,620 --> 02:55:39,480
Oh my...

3791
02:55:48,200 --> 02:55:49,200
Yeah, that's right.

3792
02:55:49,660 --> 02:55:50,140
Try.

3793
02:55:50,760 --> 02:55:51,240
Ah!

3794
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:53,420
How does he get me every time?

3795
02:55:54,060 --> 02:55:56,720
It's so hard to avoid his stupid dodge!

3796
02:55:59,040 --> 02:55:59,900
Oh my god.

3797
02:56:04,370 --> 02:56:06,450
Yeah, I gotta get him in like the corner of Rex.

3798
02:56:11,170 --> 02:56:12,290
But I don't know.

3799
02:56:12,350 --> 02:56:14,670
I'm not skilled enough to be... It's actually...

3800
02:56:14,670 --> 02:56:16,310
It's actually a skill issue.

3801
02:56:16,610 --> 02:56:19,030
I'm like actually not skilled enough to do it, I think.

3802
02:56:22,050 --> 02:56:22,570
Oh!

3803
02:56:22,870 --> 02:56:25,310
I'm out of life!

3804
02:56:25,410 --> 02:56:26,390
That's more like it!

3805
02:56:28,270 --> 02:56:29,950
I think he tapped me!

3806
02:56:33,520 --> 02:56:34,900
Well, remember what Miller said?

3807
02:56:35,060 --> 02:56:37,480
Liquid uses CQB, which hits harder.

3808
02:56:38,020 --> 02:56:42,400
Why didn't... Why didn't... Why wouldn't... Why didn't Dad teach us CQB?

3809
02:56:43,100 --> 02:56:45,640
Why does Big Boss hate us?

3810
02:56:45,800 --> 02:56:46,900
Why does he hate us?

3811
02:56:48,560 --> 02:56:49,120
Oh.

3812
02:56:50,420 --> 02:56:50,980
Shit.

3813
02:56:53,400 --> 02:56:54,960
Why does he hate us?

3814
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:07,540
Why does he hate us?

3815
02:57:16,770 --> 02:57:17,890
What's wrong, Snake?

3816
02:57:18,250 --> 02:57:23,650
I try... I like spam the button to be able to get in enough hits before the iframes kick in.

3817
02:57:26,290 --> 02:57:26,850
But...

3818
02:57:28,030 --> 02:57:29,350
But then this happens!

3819
02:57:31,110 --> 02:57:31,790
Stop it!

3820
02:57:31,830 --> 02:57:32,450
Stop it!

3821
02:57:32,570 --> 02:57:33,110
Stop it!

3822
02:57:33,570 --> 02:57:34,090
Stop it!

3823
02:57:34,650 --> 02:57:34,990
Yeah.

3824
02:57:45,540 --> 02:57:46,320
Don't charge.

3825
02:57:47,540 --> 02:57:48,060
Oh!

3826
02:57:49,700 --> 02:57:50,740
Did that hurt me for real?

3827
02:58:10,190 --> 02:58:11,790
I hate fighting you!

3828
02:58:14,090 --> 02:58:14,610
I'm...

3829
02:58:20,460 --> 02:58:22,440
This is Mint's Elden Ring.

3830
02:58:23,900 --> 02:58:25,600
Do throws not work on him?

3831
02:58:25,620 --> 02:58:26,320
No, they don't.

3832
02:58:27,940 --> 02:58:28,460
See?

3833
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:36,940
Oh, see?

3834
02:58:37,060 --> 02:58:37,380
Like here.

3835
02:58:37,780 --> 02:58:38,480
One, two.

3836
02:58:38,560 --> 02:58:39,040
One, two.

3837
02:58:39,140 --> 02:58:39,300
Oh.

3838
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:41,220
Then he... he gets me.

3839
02:58:41,320 --> 02:58:45,020
I don't know what... like the angle or anything that he needs to be in in the court.

3840
02:58:45,180 --> 02:58:45,760
I have no idea.

3841
02:58:45,860 --> 02:58:46,760
So I'm not even gonna attempt.

3842
02:58:46,940 --> 02:58:47,180
See?

3843
02:58:47,260 --> 02:58:47,600
Like here.

3844
02:58:47,720 --> 02:58:48,360
It's perfect.

3845
02:58:48,460 --> 02:58:49,220
And then you...

3846
02:58:49,220 --> 02:58:49,720
One, two.

3847
02:58:49,800 --> 02:58:50,160
One...

3848
02:58:50,160 --> 02:58:51,840
But I... I just can't...

3849
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:53,260
I can't get to him!

3850
02:58:54,500 --> 02:58:55,060
Get away!

3851
02:58:55,300 --> 02:58:55,860
Go... I mean...

3852
02:58:55,860 --> 02:58:56,860
Just die!

3853
02:58:57,060 --> 02:58:57,720
Just die!

3854
02:58:57,860 --> 02:58:58,740
Why are you like...

3855
02:58:58,740 --> 02:59:00,120
Why are you like this?

3856
02:59:01,360 --> 02:59:01,720
Oh.

3857
02:59:01,720 --> 02:59:02,080
Sorry.

3858
02:59:02,180 --> 02:59:02,400
My bad.

3859
02:59:02,540 --> 02:59:03,040
We're fine.

3860
02:59:03,900 --> 02:59:07,060
Get him!

3861
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:14,120
I think like...

3862
02:59:14,640 --> 02:59:16,320
Out of the whole game...

3863
02:59:16,320 --> 02:59:17,560
I know this is...

3864
02:59:17,560 --> 02:59:17,920
Oh my god.

3865
02:59:17,960 --> 02:59:18,380
Oh my god.

3866
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:18,820
I didn't realize.

3867
02:59:19,140 --> 02:59:20,840
I didn't realize we were at that point already.

3868
02:59:20,940 --> 02:59:22,980
This is definitely my least favorite fight...

3869
02:59:22,980 --> 02:59:24,320
In the whole game.

3870
02:59:24,800 --> 02:59:25,800
Because it just...

3871
02:59:25,800 --> 02:59:27,500
Feels very unfair.

3872
02:59:32,140 --> 02:59:34,140
It's so... It feels so unfair.

3873
02:59:37,880 --> 02:59:38,980
Because he's so manic!

3874
02:59:39,160 --> 02:59:40,640
He's so freaking manic!

3875
02:59:41,560 --> 02:59:42,340
Oh my god.

3876
02:59:44,320 --> 02:59:45,520
It's all... It's everything.

3877
02:59:45,780 --> 02:59:46,760
It's how hard he hits.

3878
02:59:47,440 --> 02:59:48,380
It's... It's...

3879
02:59:49,100 --> 02:59:50,300
It's the time limit.

3880
02:59:50,460 --> 02:59:53,620
It's just everything that is so hard for me.

3881
02:59:59,050 --> 03:00:01,110
I know next hit is gonna kill me.

3882
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:04,110
See?

3883
03:00:04,110 --> 03:00:04,630
There...

3884
03:00:04,630 --> 03:00:04,650
Ugh.

3885
03:00:22,450 --> 03:00:23,910
It's not even the final boss!

3886
03:00:23,910 --> 03:00:25,710
It's not even the final boss!

3887
03:00:30,610 --> 03:00:33,030
Why did he get iframes there?

3888
03:00:34,010 --> 03:00:34,930
Oh my god.

3889
03:00:36,530 --> 03:00:36,990
Ugh.

3890
03:00:37,390 --> 03:00:39,270
That was the furthest I think I've gotten though.

3891
03:00:46,730 --> 03:00:48,450
I need to learn the...

3892
03:00:50,370 --> 03:00:51,850
The speedrunner way, you know?

3893
03:01:09,780 --> 03:01:10,740
The speedrunner way?

3894
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:28,760
I don't understand this game.

3895
03:01:28,760 --> 03:01:31,460
Some of the...

3896
03:01:31,460 --> 03:01:32,440
Some of the enemies that I have to fight there.

3897
03:01:32,440 --> 03:01:32,500
And I only have one life left.

3898
03:01:32,520 --> 03:01:33,040
I don't have to another life.

3899
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:33,320
That's not the point.

3900
03:01:33,320 --> 03:01:33,440
You just have to have the right move.

3901
03:01:33,440 --> 03:01:33,820
I mean, it's just...

3902
03:01:33,820 --> 03:01:34,180
I just have to...

3903
03:01:34,180 --> 03:01:35,440
I just have to...

3904
03:01:35,440 --> 03:01:35,940
You...

3905
03:01:35,940 --> 03:01:36,560
Oh!

3906
03:01:36,840 --> 03:01:37,320
Oh!

3907
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:38,740
I just let it happen.

3908
03:01:41,460 --> 03:01:42,740
I just... I just...

3909
03:01:44,920 --> 03:01:45,400
Oh!

3910
03:01:45,540 --> 03:01:45,840
Ouch!

3911
03:01:45,900 --> 03:01:46,080
Ouch!

3912
03:01:46,160 --> 03:01:46,400
Ouch!

3913
03:01:50,870 --> 03:01:51,350
Ouch!

3914
03:01:51,630 --> 03:01:51,710
Ouch!

3915
03:01:56,230 --> 03:01:57,790
Why can't I get more?

3916
03:01:58,090 --> 03:02:00,370
Why can't I get more hits?

3917
03:02:00,550 --> 03:02:02,290
It's so weird sometimes.

3918
03:02:03,010 --> 03:02:03,570
Oh my god!

3919
03:02:03,670 --> 03:02:03,930
Oh!

3920
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:21,220
Like even if I do the one-two, I only get the one in.

3921
03:02:47,230 --> 03:02:48,110
There's... Oh my god!

3922
03:02:48,850 --> 03:02:49,170
Alright!

3923
03:03:02,040 --> 03:03:02,480
That's right!

3924
03:03:06,310 --> 03:03:06,890
Oh shoot!

3925
03:03:07,250 --> 03:03:07,790
Oh nice!

3926
03:03:07,830 --> 03:03:07,990
Nice!

3927
03:03:08,070 --> 03:03:08,110
Nice!

3928
03:03:10,070 --> 03:03:10,390
God!

3929
03:03:15,180 --> 03:03:15,460
Oh my god!

3930
03:03:15,480 --> 03:03:15,700
Please!

3931
03:03:17,400 --> 03:03:17,940
Come on!

3932
03:03:17,980 --> 03:03:18,260
Come on!

3933
03:03:18,260 --> 03:03:18,580
Come on!

3934
03:03:18,620 --> 03:03:19,000
Get up!

3935
03:03:22,120 --> 03:03:22,520
Oh my god!

3936
03:03:22,560 --> 03:03:22,840
Ouch!

3937
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:23,060
Ouch!

3938
03:03:23,060 --> 03:03:23,220
Ouch!

3939
03:03:23,220 --> 03:03:23,340
Ouch!

3940
03:03:23,340 --> 03:03:23,720
Oh shit!

3941
03:03:23,780 --> 03:03:23,940
Shit!

3942
03:03:23,940 --> 03:03:24,060
Shit!

3943
03:03:24,080 --> 03:03:24,160
Shit!

3944
03:03:24,160 --> 03:03:24,260
Shit!

3945
03:03:24,260 --> 03:03:24,260
Shit!

3946
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:25,920
I know!

3947
03:03:26,820 --> 03:03:27,760
You're not helping!

3948
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:28,600
Get up!

3949
03:03:28,680 --> 03:03:28,940
Get up!

3950
03:03:28,980 --> 03:03:29,280
Get up!

3951
03:03:29,320 --> 03:03:29,540
Get up!

3952
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:29,820
Get up!

3953
03:03:29,900 --> 03:03:30,380
Please!

3954
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:31,740
Oh my god!

3955
03:03:35,460 --> 03:03:37,580
You are so unfair, Liquid!

3956
03:03:37,820 --> 03:03:39,500
You are so unfair!

3957
03:03:45,840 --> 03:03:47,320
Oh my god!

3958
03:03:50,120 --> 03:03:50,600
Oh!

3959
03:03:50,780 --> 03:03:52,380
That was genuinely a great attempt.

3960
03:03:52,540 --> 03:03:52,900
Good job.

3961
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,160
I was... I really was doing well in the beginning too.

3962
03:03:56,520 --> 03:03:59,480
Like I had no... no hits for a while.

3963
03:04:00,460 --> 03:04:01,260
Which was great.

3964
03:04:03,280 --> 03:04:03,680
Oh!

3965
03:04:15,520 --> 03:04:16,320
Oh bitch!

3966
03:04:17,720 --> 03:04:18,120
Words

3967
03:04:22,270 --> 03:04:22,490
hit!

3968
03:04:22,630 --> 03:04:23,610
This makes no sense!

3969
03:04:31,750 --> 03:04:32,150
World!

3970
03:04:32,610 --> 03:04:33,530
Oh maybe not that.

3971
03:04:33,870 --> 03:04:36,990
That's a bit of a dramatic... dramatization.

3972
03:04:37,370 --> 03:04:37,570
But...

3973
03:04:37,570 --> 03:04:38,970
But you know what I mean.

3974
03:04:40,230 --> 03:04:41,450
He's got them long legs.

3975
03:04:41,470 --> 03:04:42,090
Look at me though!

3976
03:04:42,290 --> 03:04:42,490
Ouch!

3977
03:04:42,670 --> 03:04:43,850
Look at my legs though!

3978
03:04:43,930 --> 03:04:44,610
They're much longer.

3979
03:04:45,730 --> 03:04:46,870
I'm way more agile.

3980
03:04:49,010 --> 03:04:51,530
I'm way more agile than this nerd.

3981
03:05:04,250 --> 03:05:05,750
It's so hard to read him.

3982
03:05:07,050 --> 03:05:09,750
It's so hard to read when he's gonna charge at me.

3983
03:05:12,650 --> 03:05:13,050
I...

3984
03:05:17,780 --> 03:05:19,640
I wasn't sure if he was gonna hit me so I...

3985
03:05:19,640 --> 03:05:20,660
Oh my god.

3986
03:05:21,300 --> 03:05:25,520
I have iframes too!

3987
03:05:26,020 --> 03:05:26,940
Let me use them!

3988
03:05:27,220 --> 03:05:27,620
Oh my god!

3989
03:05:27,620 --> 03:05:27,780
Come on!

3990
03:05:31,540 --> 03:05:32,840
Don't hit me twice.

3991
03:05:32,840 --> 03:05:33,660
It's so unfair.

3992
03:05:49,380 --> 03:05:50,300
I'm out of patience.

3993
03:05:50,680 --> 03:05:52,520
That's more... that's more what I'm out of.

3994
03:05:53,060 --> 03:05:54,120
I'm out of patience.

3995
03:05:54,420 --> 03:05:55,480
I'm out of patience!

3996
03:05:55,560 --> 03:05:56,780
Stop hitting me twice!

3997
03:05:58,660 --> 03:06:02,320
Can anyone explain to me why sometimes my hits don't land and sometimes...

3998
03:06:02,320 --> 03:06:03,420
Is it because I'm too far away?

3999
03:06:03,960 --> 03:06:04,840
Is that the issue?

4000
03:06:08,920 --> 03:06:10,040
Why are you running?

4001
03:06:11,840 --> 03:06:12,320
See?

4002
03:06:16,320 --> 03:06:17,840
I think it's when he's blocking.

4003
03:06:18,100 --> 03:06:18,920
How can you tell though?

4004
03:06:20,760 --> 03:06:21,720
Wrong angle.

4005
03:06:21,960 --> 03:06:22,880
Too far away.

4006
03:06:23,440 --> 03:06:24,380
Bad angle.

4007
03:06:25,380 --> 03:06:26,520
You died again.

4008
03:06:26,600 --> 03:06:27,500
No fucking shit!

4009
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:34,280
This is the fight I'm worst at in the game.

4010
03:06:34,880 --> 03:06:36,500
Anybody surprised by that?

4011
03:06:36,680 --> 03:06:37,160
Shit.

4012
03:06:47,590 --> 03:06:48,450
Hands can't reach.

4013
03:06:48,710 --> 03:06:49,450
Catch these hands!

4014
03:06:53,890 --> 03:06:56,310
So I just gotta get real close in on him.

4015
03:06:56,850 --> 03:06:58,510
Just gotta be like, hey baby girl!

4016
03:06:59,870 --> 03:07:00,990
Or not like that.

4017
03:07:03,490 --> 03:07:05,930
Why sometimes he gets iframes after one hit in phase two?

4018
03:07:05,970 --> 03:07:08,830
He frequently gets that and a free counter attack in that phase.

4019
03:07:08,970 --> 03:07:13,130
He generally will not if you hit him after and does a move of his own.

4020
03:07:13,230 --> 03:07:14,570
Wait so... wait what?

4021
03:07:15,070 --> 03:07:15,470
Hahaha.

4022
03:07:16,990 --> 03:07:18,030
I thought that was a...

4023
03:07:18,030 --> 03:07:21,350
I think I didn't understand.

4024
03:07:21,970 --> 03:07:22,490
But that's okay.

4025
03:07:22,670 --> 03:07:23,450
You tried helping.

4026
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:24,170
I appreciate it.

4027
03:07:24,410 --> 03:07:24,650
Oh!

4028
03:07:24,810 --> 03:07:25,290
Whoopsie.

4029
03:07:25,950 --> 03:07:26,550
Get up.

4030
03:07:28,510 --> 03:07:29,250
Please don't.

4031
03:07:29,250 --> 03:07:30,090
Please don't charge me.

4032
03:07:31,210 --> 03:07:31,690
Yeah.

4033
03:07:32,270 --> 03:07:32,750
Okay.

4034
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:34,630
We'll get him eventually though, guys.

4035
03:07:35,110 --> 03:07:36,370
Oh sh... God.

4036
03:07:36,930 --> 03:07:37,410
See?

4037
03:07:37,490 --> 03:07:38,250
There he goes again.

4038
03:07:55,140 --> 03:07:56,000
Bitches run around!

4039
03:08:01,440 --> 03:08:02,200
Are you gonna charge at me?

4040
03:08:04,320 --> 03:08:05,680
Felt like he was gonna charge at me.

4041
03:08:06,540 --> 03:08:08,020
There he goes.

4042
03:08:15,100 --> 03:08:16,180
Get up, Liquid!

4043
03:08:16,600 --> 03:08:18,700
Oh, why are you phased through the ground a little bit?

4044
03:08:44,100 --> 03:08:45,780
And I know he kicks over.

4045
03:08:47,600 --> 03:08:48,000
Ouch!

4046
03:09:00,360 --> 03:09:01,760
Told you we'd get him eventually.

4047
03:09:01,760 --> 03:09:02,500
Hahaha.

4048
03:09:03,060 --> 03:09:03,940
First try, baby!

4049
03:09:07,320 --> 03:09:08,040
Yippee!

4050
03:09:08,180 --> 03:09:08,680
Okay.

4051
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:11,140
We're in the homestretch, everybody.

4052
03:09:11,560 --> 03:09:11,760
Meryl?

4053
03:09:13,660 --> 03:09:14,600
Uh-oh.

4054
03:09:20,310 --> 03:09:21,030
Meryl!

4055
03:09:26,660 --> 03:09:27,380
Meryl!

4056
03:09:35,980 --> 03:09:37,840
I didn't submit!

4057
03:09:38,260 --> 03:09:39,720
I didn't submit!

4058
03:09:40,460 --> 03:09:40,820
Damn!

4059
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:45,280
I have to...

4060
03:09:45,280 --> 03:09:46,980
I gave in to my feelings.

4061
03:09:46,980 --> 03:09:51,520
I have to be on the planet without a god.

4062
03:09:51,560 --> 03:09:53,260
I sold your life to save my own.

4063
03:09:53,280 --> 03:09:54,340
It's the nerd ending.

4064
03:09:55,980 --> 03:09:56,860
I'm a loser.

4065
03:09:58,300 --> 03:09:59,520
I'm not the hero you thought I was.

4066
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:01,340
For anybody who's joined later...

4067
03:10:01,900 --> 03:10:02,660
I'm nothing!

4068
03:10:02,820 --> 03:10:05,100
This is not the original save that I started from.

4069
03:10:05,320 --> 03:10:08,080
Basically, I started with the normal game.

4070
03:10:08,260 --> 03:10:08,760
I'm sorry.

4071
03:10:09,360 --> 03:10:10,200
Forgive me.

4072
03:10:10,220 --> 03:10:11,640
I started with the normal game.

4073
03:10:11,940 --> 03:10:13,100
And I did not submit.

4074
03:10:13,420 --> 03:10:14,120
I, uh...

4075
03:10:14,120 --> 03:10:14,920
Meryl can't forgive you anymore.

4076
03:10:14,920 --> 03:10:15,800
I made it through the torture.

4077
03:10:16,540 --> 03:10:17,020
But...

4078
03:10:17,800 --> 03:10:18,280
Um...

4079
03:10:18,280 --> 03:10:22,520
To play the mint model, I couldn't do it on the Master Collection.

4080
03:10:23,160 --> 03:10:27,100
So instead, they gave me a save that had the model in there.

4081
03:10:27,220 --> 03:10:29,060
I guess blaming yourself makes it easier.

4082
03:10:29,400 --> 03:10:29,880
And then...

4083
03:10:29,880 --> 03:10:30,680
Um...

4084
03:10:31,280 --> 03:10:32,800
And so I wasn't sure...

4085
03:10:32,800 --> 03:10:34,240
If you do that, you can keep the pain at a nice safe distance.

4086
03:10:34,240 --> 03:10:37,800
The save started me at Vulcan Raven, so I wasn't sure if...

4087
03:10:37,800 --> 03:10:37,880
What the hell do you know?

4088
03:10:37,880 --> 03:10:38,280
Meryl's dead!

4089
03:10:38,780 --> 03:10:39,880
Which one we would give...

4090
03:10:39,880 --> 03:10:40,180
I lost!

4091
03:10:42,260 --> 03:10:42,740
So...

4092
03:10:43,180 --> 03:10:44,620
Are you gonna stay here and die?

4093
03:10:45,640 --> 03:10:46,580
Along with her?

4094
03:10:48,080 --> 03:10:51,480
So anybody who came in late and was curious about why...

4095
03:10:51,480 --> 03:10:52,040
Snake...

4096
03:10:52,580 --> 03:10:54,160
I was like, which one are we gonna get?

4097
03:10:54,240 --> 03:10:54,660
It's gotcha!

4098
03:10:54,680 --> 03:10:54,980
People die.

4099
03:10:56,120 --> 03:10:56,820
Damn, Otacon.

4100
03:10:56,820 --> 03:10:57,920
But death is not defeat.

4101
03:10:58,240 --> 03:10:58,980
Damn, Otacon!

4102
03:10:59,720 --> 03:11:01,000
Dang, I kinda wanted to...

4103
03:11:01,000 --> 03:11:01,220
That's what Henry was saying.

4104
03:11:01,220 --> 03:11:02,860
I wanted to have the canon ending, though.

4105
03:11:04,240 --> 03:11:04,700
That's what Henry was saying.

4106
03:11:04,780 --> 03:11:06,180
I lost Wolf to him.

4107
03:11:06,180 --> 03:11:06,520
But it's okay.

4108
03:11:08,180 --> 03:11:09,040
But that wasn't defeat.

4109
03:11:09,040 --> 03:11:10,080
Jeremy did this on purpose.

4110
03:11:11,340 --> 03:11:13,200
She and I will be together forever.

4111
03:11:14,420 --> 03:11:16,100
We didn't lose anything.

4112
03:11:16,220 --> 03:11:16,560
But that wasn't defeat.

4113
03:11:18,360 --> 03:11:19,200
Together forever.

4114
03:11:20,880 --> 03:11:21,760
It's true that Wolf is dead.

4115
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:22,880
This is the canon ending.

4116
03:11:23,260 --> 03:11:23,660
Stop!

4117
03:11:24,120 --> 03:11:24,200
Stop!

4118
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:25,840
But our love didn't end with her.

4119
03:11:28,380 --> 03:11:30,260
Life's more than just a game of winning and losing.

4120
03:11:30,260 --> 03:11:30,280
Oh my god.

4121
03:11:30,280 --> 03:11:31,840
Otacon is consoling me.

4122
03:11:31,860 --> 03:11:32,320
Don't you think?

4123
03:11:35,360 --> 03:11:36,560
Let's live, Snake.

4124
03:11:36,800 --> 03:11:37,580
Look at Otacon.

4125
03:11:37,580 --> 03:11:38,680
He's consoling me.

4126
03:11:40,240 --> 03:11:42,220
There's a parking garage right next door.

4127
03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:44,640
We can get to the surface from there.

4128
03:11:44,740 --> 03:11:46,380
Can you imagine parking right next to Red?

4129
03:11:46,420 --> 03:11:46,540
Come on, Snake.

4130
03:11:46,540 --> 03:11:46,780
Come on.

4131
03:11:49,980 --> 03:11:51,040
Oh my god.

4132
03:11:51,160 --> 03:11:51,960
Merrill is so tiny.

4133
03:11:51,960 --> 03:11:53,000
I released all the security locks.

4134
03:11:53,420 --> 03:11:54,460
It'll be okay.

4135
03:11:54,700 --> 03:11:55,460
We can escape.

4136
03:11:55,800 --> 03:11:55,820
Merrill is so tiny.

4137
03:11:58,100 --> 03:11:59,140
Jeremy is like this.

4138
03:11:59,140 --> 03:12:00,600
You have my word on it.

4139
03:12:01,640 --> 03:12:02,080
Otacon.

4140
03:12:02,080 --> 03:12:02,100
You changed.

4141
03:12:02,100 --> 03:12:04,720
This is the canon ending for Solid Mint.

4142
03:12:04,860 --> 03:12:05,100
Yeah.

4143
03:12:05,960 --> 03:12:07,720
I'm through regretting the past.

4144
03:12:09,640 --> 03:12:11,680
Life isn't all about loss, you know?

4145
03:12:11,700 --> 03:12:13,100
Otacon, you changed.

4146
03:12:16,020 --> 03:12:16,520
It's sad.

4147
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:16,900
To start it.

4148
03:12:17,040 --> 03:12:17,400
Ooh.

4149
03:12:18,940 --> 03:12:19,980
Those guys.

4150
03:12:20,280 --> 03:12:23,460
It seems like they only hurry when they're destroying things.

4151
03:12:24,880 --> 03:12:26,180
One true parent.

4152
03:12:26,380 --> 03:12:26,540
Good.

4153
03:12:26,840 --> 03:12:28,240
Let him destroy it.

4154
03:12:28,340 --> 03:12:28,860
Hey.

4155
03:12:28,920 --> 03:12:31,100
But they can't destroy the human spirit.

4156
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:32,240
I also prefer this ending.

4157
03:12:32,360 --> 03:12:32,840
But you know.

4158
03:12:34,740 --> 03:12:35,300
Okay.

4159
03:12:36,200 --> 03:12:37,000
Let's go.

4160
03:12:37,220 --> 03:12:37,820
Let's go.

4161
03:12:42,160 --> 03:12:42,720
Merrill.

4162
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:43,260
Uh.

4163
03:12:43,460 --> 03:12:44,480
It's jiggling.

4164
03:12:44,480 --> 03:12:45,500
I hope you're still watching me.

4165
03:12:45,660 --> 03:12:47,720
It's like vibrating on my...

4166
03:12:47,720 --> 03:12:48,180
Maybe I can prove myself to you all.

4167
03:12:51,400 --> 03:12:52,440
Shut up!

4168
03:12:52,620 --> 03:12:54,500
The GOGF is so unstable!

4169
03:12:57,100 --> 03:12:59,920
I would have had no cutscenes or something, you know?

4170
03:13:02,700 --> 03:13:04,380
Put on my sneaky suit!

4171
03:13:07,060 --> 03:13:08,760
It's vibrating against my thigh.

4172
03:13:08,960 --> 03:13:10,360
It feels nice, like a massage.

4173
03:13:19,560 --> 03:13:21,060
I didn't change anything!

4174
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,260
Oh sorry, I have my little cat mouth now.

4175
03:13:29,600 --> 03:13:31,160
I'm more smug.

4176
03:13:33,020 --> 03:13:34,460
Merle had beer o'clock.

4177
03:13:40,300 --> 03:13:41,440
Call me!

4178
03:13:41,620 --> 03:13:42,140
Call!

4179
03:13:43,020 --> 03:13:43,620
Alrighty.

4180
03:13:47,320 --> 03:13:47,920
Awesome.

4181
03:13:50,160 --> 03:13:50,560
Hurry!

4182
03:13:54,340 --> 03:13:55,300
I'm going, I'm going!

4183
03:13:56,560 --> 03:13:57,580
Isn't there some stuff here?

4184
03:13:57,740 --> 03:13:57,880
Yeah.

4185
03:13:58,160 --> 03:14:00,560
Oh, I only have one ration.

4186
03:14:01,340 --> 03:14:02,760
I lost all my stuff.

4187
03:14:03,200 --> 03:14:04,100
Come on, let's go.

4188
03:14:05,340 --> 03:14:06,520
Don't alert the guards!

4189
03:14:07,960 --> 03:14:09,340
Why did you do that?

4190
03:14:09,940 --> 03:14:10,340
Otacon!

4191
03:14:11,960 --> 03:14:12,660
Where's the gun?

4192
03:14:13,700 --> 03:14:14,400
Where's the gun?

4193
03:14:14,940 --> 03:14:15,840
Otacon, where's the gun?

4194
03:14:15,980 --> 03:14:16,380
Oh my god!

4195
03:14:16,520 --> 03:14:17,340
Otacon, where's the gun?

4196
03:14:17,440 --> 03:14:18,040
Let's go!

4197
03:14:19,900 --> 03:14:20,220
Okay.

4198
03:14:40,340 --> 03:14:42,460
I think I forgot to get... wasn't there a second ration?

4199
03:14:42,760 --> 03:14:43,180
Uh-oh.

4200
03:14:44,320 --> 03:14:44,860
Uh-oh.

4201
03:14:45,240 --> 03:14:46,520
If we have to redo it, it's fine.

4202
03:14:49,440 --> 03:14:49,960
Good night!

4203
03:14:55,570 --> 03:14:56,810
Otacon, I'm ready to do it!

4204
03:14:56,870 --> 03:14:57,630
I'm ready to shoot him!

4205
03:14:57,690 --> 03:14:58,770
I'm ready to mow him down!

4206
03:14:59,170 --> 03:15:00,210
I'm ready to mow him down!

4207
03:15:00,270 --> 03:15:00,350
Oh!

4208
03:15:09,380 --> 03:15:09,700
Yeah!

4209
03:15:10,960 --> 03:15:12,260
I'm ready to mow him down!

4210
03:15:12,420 --> 03:15:14,640
Here, wait, which way does he... maybe this way.

4211
03:15:15,960 --> 03:15:16,280
I'm

4212
03:15:23,410 --> 03:15:23,570
trying!

4213
03:15:23,750 --> 03:15:23,990
I'm trying!

4214
03:15:23,990 --> 03:15:25,690
Snake, you've got a clear path!

4215
03:15:25,990 --> 03:15:26,450
I'm trying!

4216
03:15:27,010 --> 03:15:28,710
These guys can eat bullets!

4217
03:15:40,970 --> 03:15:41,890
Was that the last one?

4218
03:15:42,030 --> 03:15:42,390
There we go.

4219
03:15:42,490 --> 03:15:43,650
Okay, here he comes.

4220
03:15:45,170 --> 03:15:46,570
Not yet, Snake!

4221
03:15:47,030 --> 03:15:49,070
It's not over yet!

4222
03:15:50,130 --> 03:15:50,650
Liquid!

4223
03:15:51,050 --> 03:15:51,230
Liquid!

4224
03:16:01,360 --> 03:16:01,880
Yeah!

4225
03:16:07,420 --> 03:16:08,960
Where's my body armor, huh?

4226
03:16:09,560 --> 03:16:10,860
I had all my stuff.

4227
03:16:10,960 --> 03:16:12,740
What did you do with my stuff, you stealer?

4228
03:16:12,880 --> 03:16:14,600
You stole my st... oh, ouch!

4229
03:16:14,780 --> 03:16:16,100
You stole my stuff!

4230
03:16:16,200 --> 03:16:17,220
You stole my stuff!

4231
03:16:17,220 --> 03:16:18,260
Oh my god.

4232
03:16:19,520 --> 03:16:20,220
You thief!

4233
03:16:21,760 --> 03:16:22,820
You're such a thief!

4234
03:16:23,920 --> 03:16:25,040
Oh, ouch, ouch, ouch.

4235
03:16:25,180 --> 03:16:25,860
Oh my god.

4236
03:16:28,180 --> 03:16:29,900
Why'd you steal my stuff, Liquid?

4237
03:16:29,980 --> 03:16:30,540
You jerk!

4238
03:16:49,380 --> 03:16:50,300
Take him down!

4239
03:16:50,600 --> 03:16:51,160
Take him down!

4240
03:16:57,490 --> 03:16:59,010
Alarolcha, I'm hitting you!

4241
03:17:15,350 --> 03:17:15,870
Alarolcha!

4242
03:17:17,070 --> 03:17:17,590
Nyah!

4243
03:17:18,750 --> 03:17:19,270
Nyah!

4244
03:17:19,950 --> 03:17:20,470
Nyah!

4245
03:18:01,910 --> 03:18:04,210
Yeah, I'm ready for big boss rank.

4246
03:18:04,470 --> 03:18:05,290
Are you okay?

4247
03:18:07,670 --> 03:18:08,770
I guess so.

4248
03:18:08,970 --> 03:18:09,630
Otacon, don't.

4249
03:18:09,630 --> 03:18:11,430
Otacon, can you move?

4250
03:18:11,650 --> 03:18:12,330
It's embarrassing.

4251
03:18:12,630 --> 03:18:13,030
I'm in a skirt.

4252
03:18:13,350 --> 03:18:13,950
It's no use.

4253
03:18:14,150 --> 03:18:14,970
I can't move.

4254
03:18:15,450 --> 03:18:15,930
I'll lift the car.

4255
03:18:15,930 --> 03:18:15,930
I'm strong.

4256
03:18:15,930 --> 03:18:16,750
What happened to Liquid?

4257
03:18:18,090 --> 03:18:20,630
I don't know, but I hope he's dead.

4258
03:18:20,930 --> 03:18:21,870
Thank you for the super diet!

4259
03:18:23,430 --> 03:18:24,210
Liquid's dead.

4260
03:18:28,140 --> 03:18:28,660
Finally.

4261
03:18:29,020 --> 03:18:29,400
Uh oh.

4262
03:18:29,900 --> 03:18:30,920
Oh my god.

4263
03:18:30,960 --> 03:18:31,340
Snake!

4264
03:18:37,130 --> 03:18:38,150
Oh my god.

4265
03:18:41,190 --> 03:18:41,990
Look at me.

4266
03:18:42,230 --> 03:18:42,990
Snake!

4267
03:18:44,550 --> 03:18:45,970
He hates anime.

4268
03:18:47,630 --> 03:18:48,930
He hates anime.

4269
03:18:55,580 --> 03:18:56,340
Die.

4270
03:18:59,780 --> 03:19:00,540
Janna!

4271
03:19:00,840 --> 03:19:01,440
No, I'm just kidding.

4272
03:19:09,400 --> 03:19:10,920
Oh, he's...

4273
03:19:13,820 --> 03:19:14,840
My waifu.

4274
03:19:19,240 --> 03:19:19,760
Yeah!

4275
03:19:20,100 --> 03:19:21,200
Now he's dead!

4276
03:19:21,460 --> 03:19:21,760
Woohoo!

4277
03:19:22,760 --> 03:19:24,500
If he's dead, that means...

4278
03:19:24,500 --> 03:19:24,680
Oh.

4279
03:19:24,740 --> 03:19:25,360
Oh, wait.

4280
03:19:25,420 --> 03:19:26,260
That means about me?

4281
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:27,360
Oh, no.

4282
03:19:27,420 --> 03:19:28,460
Don't think about it, Snake.

4283
03:19:30,440 --> 03:19:30,960
Aww.

4284
03:19:33,240 --> 03:19:34,600
What happened to the air raid?

4285
03:19:35,620 --> 03:19:37,420
No stealth bombers in sight.

4286
03:19:37,600 --> 03:19:37,780
Yeah.

4287
03:19:42,560 --> 03:19:44,420
Snake, can you hear me?

4288
03:19:44,940 --> 03:19:46,700
Colonel, are you okay?

4289
03:19:47,060 --> 03:19:51,380
Actually, this ending is better because Otacon gets to be with anime.

4290
03:19:51,760 --> 03:19:52,920
Early retirement.

4291
03:19:53,160 --> 03:19:53,480
It works.

4292
03:19:53,780 --> 03:19:54,200
Arrested?

4293
03:19:54,420 --> 03:19:56,860
I was able to get into contact with the President.

4294
03:19:56,900 --> 03:19:57,400
Oh, nice!

4295
03:19:57,720 --> 03:20:00,580
Metal gear, the training exercise, all of it.

4296
03:20:00,640 --> 03:20:03,620
It was all the Secretary of Defense acting alone.

4297
03:20:04,240 --> 03:20:05,100
Acting alone?

4298
03:20:05,880 --> 03:20:07,280
What happened to the air raid?

4299
03:20:07,280 --> 03:20:08,380
And the nuclear strike?

4300
03:20:08,500 --> 03:20:08,980
He called it off.

4301
03:20:09,020 --> 03:20:10,340
The orders were rescinded.

4302
03:20:10,340 --> 03:20:10,500
Yippee!

4303
03:20:10,780 --> 03:20:15,080
The F-117s and the B-2 Spirits have returned to the base.

4304
03:20:15,300 --> 03:20:15,820
Everything's good!

4305
03:20:15,820 --> 03:20:18,980
Once again, I have complete authority over this operation.

4306
03:20:19,300 --> 03:20:19,700
Colonel.

4307
03:20:19,760 --> 03:20:20,000
I see.

4308
03:20:20,820 --> 03:20:24,220
Washington isn't stupid enough to use nukes to cover up a few secrets.

4309
03:20:24,860 --> 03:20:26,220
I wonder about that.

4310
03:20:26,360 --> 03:20:27,080
Yeah, I do too.

4311
03:20:27,300 --> 03:20:28,900
In any case, the danger's over.

4312
03:20:29,400 --> 03:20:29,880
Yeah.

4313
03:20:29,980 --> 03:20:30,460
Thanks, Snake.

4314
03:20:32,420 --> 03:20:34,100
Colonel, about Meryl.

4315
03:20:34,540 --> 03:20:35,340
About Meryl.

4316
03:20:35,360 --> 03:20:36,960
I already know.

4317
03:20:38,780 --> 03:20:39,300
Colonel.

4318
03:20:41,240 --> 03:20:44,080
Meryl was my daughter.

4319
03:20:45,060 --> 03:20:45,580
What?

4320
03:20:45,960 --> 03:20:46,920
We killed his daughter!

4321
03:20:47,140 --> 03:20:48,580
I didn't find out until recently.

4322
03:20:49,580 --> 03:20:51,480
I got a letter from her mother.

4323
03:20:51,920 --> 03:20:53,280
My dead brother's wife.

4324
03:20:54,300 --> 03:20:57,060
I was going to tell her after this operation was over.

4325
03:20:57,500 --> 03:20:58,180
Uh-oh.

4326
03:20:58,240 --> 03:20:59,560
Colonel, I...

4327
03:20:59,560 --> 03:21:01,280
It's okay, Snake.

4328
03:21:02,660 --> 03:21:03,540
Thanks anyway.

4329
03:21:04,440 --> 03:21:04,960
Snake.

4330
03:21:05,980 --> 03:21:06,740
I'm sorry.

4331
03:21:06,820 --> 03:21:07,060
I...

4332
03:21:07,060 --> 03:21:07,260
I...

4333
03:21:07,260 --> 03:21:09,000
I kept a lot of things from you.

4334
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:10,760
It's okay, Colonel.

4335
03:21:11,320 --> 03:21:11,720
Snake.

4336
03:21:11,720 --> 03:21:13,140
Are you always fated to get the Otacon?

4337
03:21:13,260 --> 03:21:14,160
I'm not a Colonel.

4338
03:21:15,640 --> 03:21:16,440
Okay, Colonel.

4339
03:21:17,040 --> 03:21:18,160
I've got a present for you.

4340
03:21:18,600 --> 03:21:20,500
There's a snowmobile close to you.

4341
03:21:20,800 --> 03:21:22,760
Mei Ling saw it on the satellite photos.

4342
03:21:23,340 --> 03:21:25,520
This time of year, the glaciers are pretty calm.

4343
03:21:25,620 --> 03:21:26,280
I actually like Meryl.

4344
03:21:26,300 --> 03:21:27,860
You should be able to ride right out of there.

4345
03:21:28,460 --> 03:21:30,200
I'll bet the boys at the D.I.A.

4346
03:21:30,220 --> 03:21:31,140
and the N.S.A.

4347
03:21:31,160 --> 03:21:33,080
never expected you to come home alive.

4348
03:21:33,600 --> 03:21:34,320
Me neither.

4349
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:36,740
I better not show my face around here.

4350
03:21:36,900 --> 03:21:37,240
I'm sorry.

4351
03:21:37,240 --> 03:21:38,560
No danger of that.

4352
03:21:39,040 --> 03:21:42,820
You two officially died after your jeep sank into the ocean.

4353
03:21:43,380 --> 03:21:45,020
That's not too far from the truth.

4354
03:21:45,980 --> 03:21:49,060
Also, there's a helicopter waiting for you on Fox Island.

4355
03:21:49,440 --> 03:21:50,620
Fox Island.

4356
03:21:50,820 --> 03:21:50,940
Okay, Roy.

4357
03:21:51,340 --> 03:21:51,820
Roy.

4358
03:21:51,980 --> 03:21:53,060
Are you going to be okay?

4359
03:21:53,660 --> 03:21:54,340
Don't worry.

4360
03:21:54,700 --> 03:21:59,300
I've got an insurance policy, a hard copy of all Mei Ling's data.

4361
03:21:59,500 --> 03:21:59,660
Whoa.

4362
03:21:59,800 --> 03:22:03,780
As long as I've got that, you, me, and Mei Ling will be fine.

4363
03:22:03,780 --> 03:22:05,040
Mei Ling saving the day.

4364
03:22:05,120 --> 03:22:06,860
The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon.

4365
03:22:07,240 --> 03:22:08,620
They won't be able to follow us.

4366
03:22:08,840 --> 03:22:10,880
I guess we won't meet again.

4367
03:22:11,600 --> 03:22:12,300
Don't worry.

4368
03:22:12,820 --> 03:22:14,140
I'll pay you a visit sometime.

4369
03:22:14,640 --> 03:22:15,100
Really?

4370
03:22:15,800 --> 03:22:17,100
I'll look forward to that.

4371
03:22:18,720 --> 03:22:20,760
Roy, just tell me one thing.

4372
03:22:21,300 --> 03:22:21,780
What?

4373
03:22:22,320 --> 03:22:23,540
About Fox Die.

4374
03:22:23,840 --> 03:22:24,260
Yeah.

4375
03:22:24,800 --> 03:22:25,760
What about me?

4376
03:22:26,080 --> 03:22:27,280
It killed Liquid.

4377
03:22:27,520 --> 03:22:28,120
It killed Liquid.

4378
03:22:28,140 --> 03:22:31,120
Naomi said that she wants to talk to you face to face about that.

4379
03:22:31,320 --> 03:22:31,340
Oh, great.

4380
03:22:31,640 --> 03:22:32,540
How is she?

4381
03:22:32,880 --> 03:22:33,580
Don't worry.

4382
03:22:33,940 --> 03:22:35,380
Mei Ling is with her right now.

4383
03:22:35,380 --> 03:22:36,620
Snake is so much better than me.

4384
03:22:37,240 --> 03:22:37,580
I need to go to Naomi.

4385
03:22:37,800 --> 03:22:39,000
I need to learn to be more like Snake.

4386
03:22:39,080 --> 03:22:39,600
Snake, it's me.

4387
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:40,960
Naomi.

4388
03:22:42,300 --> 03:22:42,700
I heard about my brother.

4389
03:22:42,700 --> 03:22:44,700
He doesn't think that Naomi is so annoying.

4390
03:22:45,060 --> 03:22:45,660
I'm sorry.

4391
03:22:46,560 --> 03:22:49,060
But he had one last message he wanted to say to you.

4392
03:22:49,960 --> 03:22:50,360
What?

4393
03:22:51,780 --> 03:22:56,100
He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your own life.

4394
03:22:56,160 --> 03:22:57,300
Snake, you're such a good person.

4395
03:22:57,720 --> 03:22:58,760
Frankie said that?

4396
03:22:58,920 --> 03:23:00,100
You're such a good person.

4397
03:23:00,180 --> 03:23:00,500
Yeah.

4398
03:23:00,580 --> 03:23:01,480
You're such a good guy.

4399
03:23:01,560 --> 03:23:03,420
He also said he'll always love you.

4400
03:23:04,020 --> 03:23:05,380
You're such a good guy, Snake.

4401
03:23:05,380 --> 03:23:05,700
Naomi.

4402
03:23:05,940 --> 03:23:06,600
She didn't deserve it.

4403
03:23:06,600 --> 03:23:07,220
Your brother just said that.

4404
03:23:07,220 --> 03:23:10,380
He has saved you, me, and the whole world.

4405
03:23:10,500 --> 03:23:12,360
She doesn't deserve those nice lies, man.

4406
03:23:12,360 --> 03:23:14,240
He fought with every ounce of strength in his body.

4407
03:23:14,380 --> 03:23:15,320
She doesn't deserve it.

4408
03:23:15,320 --> 03:23:16,700
He's such a good guy.

4409
03:23:17,340 --> 03:23:19,600
Maybe now he's finally found some peace.

4410
03:23:21,580 --> 03:23:23,480
He wasn't really my brother anymore.

4411
03:23:24,680 --> 03:23:28,420
Ever since he fought with you in Zanzibar, he's been like a ghost.

4412
03:23:30,340 --> 03:23:32,760
A ghost looking for a place to die.

4413
03:23:34,140 --> 03:23:34,720
I'm sorry.

4414
03:23:34,720 --> 03:23:35,520
I'm sorry.

4415
03:23:36,340 --> 03:23:36,900
I'm sorry.

4416
03:23:36,900 --> 03:23:37,200
I'm sorry.

4417
03:23:37,760 --> 03:23:40,720
Like a ghost's ghost.

4418
03:23:40,720 --> 03:23:41,120
Okay.

4419
03:23:41,180 --> 03:23:41,520
Shut up.

4420
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:45,920
Naomi, liquid died from Fox die, too.

4421
03:23:46,080 --> 03:23:46,340
Yeah.

4422
03:23:46,440 --> 03:23:46,900
It's kind of important.

4423
03:23:46,900 --> 03:23:47,460
What about me?

4424
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:49,080
When am I going to go?

4425
03:23:50,100 --> 03:23:50,960
That's up to you.

4426
03:23:51,840 --> 03:23:52,600
What do you mean?

4427
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:53,620
Oh, God.

4428
03:23:54,300 --> 03:23:56,080
Everybody dies when their time is up.

4429
03:23:56,100 --> 03:23:57,780
Yeah, but Naomi, I have a virus in me.

4430
03:23:57,940 --> 03:23:58,120
Yeah.

4431
03:23:58,120 --> 03:23:59,280
So when's mine up?

4432
03:24:00,840 --> 03:24:01,240
Naomi.

4433
03:24:01,280 --> 03:24:03,760
It's up to you how you use the time left to you.

4434
03:24:03,980 --> 03:24:04,220
Naomi!

4435
03:24:04,220 --> 03:24:04,360
That's not...

4436
03:24:04,360 --> 03:24:04,820
This is...

4437
03:24:05,720 --> 03:24:06,720
Live, Snake.

4438
03:24:08,040 --> 03:24:09,580
It's all I can say to you.

4439
03:24:09,660 --> 03:24:10,580
Oh my god.

4440
03:24:11,040 --> 03:24:13,040
She's just so awful!

4441
03:24:17,240 --> 03:24:18,300
Oh my god!

4442
03:24:20,020 --> 03:24:23,920
Each person is born with their fate written into their own genetic code.

4443
03:24:24,280 --> 03:24:26,540
It's unchangeable, immutable.

4444
03:24:28,400 --> 03:24:30,420
But that's not all there is to life.

4445
03:24:31,560 --> 03:24:33,340
I finally realized that.

4446
03:24:33,580 --> 03:24:35,240
Naomi, please, how long do I have?

4447
03:24:35,240 --> 03:24:36,880
You created this virus!

4448
03:24:37,240 --> 03:24:38,340
You gave it to me!

4449
03:24:39,220 --> 03:24:39,740
What?

4450
03:24:39,880 --> 03:24:41,040
How long do I have?

4451
03:24:41,060 --> 03:24:42,200
Because I wanted to know who I was.

4452
03:24:42,540 --> 03:24:44,420
Where I came from.

4453
03:24:44,540 --> 03:24:46,440
But what about me, Naomi?

4454
03:24:47,160 --> 03:24:48,040
You're so selfish.

4455
03:24:48,060 --> 03:24:51,120
I thought if I analyzed my DNA I could find out who I was.

4456
03:24:51,440 --> 03:24:52,780
Who my parents were.

4457
03:24:52,780 --> 03:24:52,840
Oh my god.

4458
03:24:53,300 --> 03:24:57,800
And I thought that if I knew that, then I'd know what path I should take in life.

4459
03:24:59,680 --> 03:25:00,520
Just live.

4460
03:25:00,640 --> 03:25:01,260
Just live.

4461
03:25:01,260 --> 03:25:02,500
Just live, forehead.

4462
03:25:02,720 --> 03:25:03,740
I didn't find anything.

4463
03:25:05,240 --> 03:25:05,620
You're talking to me!

4464
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:08,240
I'm talking to Otacon!

4465
03:25:08,680 --> 03:25:16,000
Just like with the genome soldiers, you can input all the genetic information but that doesn't make them into the strongest soldiers.

4466
03:25:16,980 --> 03:25:21,020
The most we can say about DNA is that it governs a person's potential strengths.

4467
03:25:21,640 --> 03:25:22,560
Potential destiny.

4468
03:25:25,560 --> 03:25:28,100
You mustn't allow yourself I have no idea on this.

4469
03:25:28,100 --> 03:25:30,700
to be ruled by your genes.

4470
03:25:31,800 --> 03:25:35,140
Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.

4471
03:25:36,020 --> 03:25:36,540
Smug.

4472
03:25:37,840 --> 03:25:42,640
Snake, whether or not you're in the Foxdive program isn't important.

4473
03:25:42,980 --> 03:25:43,520
Don't trip.

4474
03:25:43,720 --> 03:25:46,300
The important thing is that you choose life.

4475
03:25:47,440 --> 03:25:48,700
And then live.

4476
03:25:49,080 --> 03:25:49,600
Live.

4477
03:25:50,100 --> 03:25:50,900
Don't you think, Snake?

4478
03:25:51,320 --> 03:25:52,420
Oh, oh, oh!

4479
03:25:53,600 --> 03:25:55,220
I'm going to choose life too.

4480
03:25:56,240 --> 03:25:58,720
Until today I've always looked for a reason to live.

4481
03:25:58,840 --> 03:25:58,860
Oh, brother.

4482
03:25:58,960 --> 03:26:03,600
But from here on, I'm going to just live.

4483
03:26:04,140 --> 03:26:06,380
Look at us going down the little hill together.

4484
03:26:06,580 --> 03:26:07,320
We're so cute.

4485
03:26:12,800 --> 03:26:14,180
She keeps going, man.

4486
03:26:15,180 --> 03:26:16,480
She just keeps on going.

4487
03:26:17,740 --> 03:26:18,200
Yay!

4488
03:26:18,200 --> 03:26:18,660
Snowmobile!

4489
03:26:19,060 --> 03:26:20,620
Living is a link to the future.

4490
03:26:22,340 --> 03:26:23,720
That's how all life works.

4491
03:26:26,080 --> 03:26:27,020
Loving each other.

4492
03:26:27,320 --> 03:26:28,400
Teaching each other.

4493
03:26:28,520 --> 03:26:31,080
Sorry, when it says loving each other and looks at Otacon, please!

4494
03:26:31,780 --> 03:26:32,720
This game!

4495
03:26:33,120 --> 03:26:34,300
They know what they're doing.

4496
03:26:36,260 --> 03:26:38,080
I finally realized it.

4497
03:26:38,780 --> 03:26:40,420
The true meaning of life.

4498
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:41,980
What is she yapping about?

4499
03:26:42,900 --> 03:26:43,840
Thank you, Snake.

4500
03:26:46,600 --> 03:26:47,240
That's me.

4501
03:26:48,340 --> 03:26:49,340
Thank you, Mint.

4502
03:26:51,760 --> 03:26:53,100
Oh, I'm driving.

4503
03:26:53,440 --> 03:26:54,300
Oh my gosh!

4504
03:26:54,420 --> 03:26:54,920
I don't know how to...

4505
03:26:54,920 --> 03:26:57,160
Until today, I've lived only for myself.

4506
03:26:58,880 --> 03:27:01,540
Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life.

4507
03:27:02,980 --> 03:27:04,100
That's not just you.

4508
03:27:04,520 --> 03:27:05,780
That's how everyone is.

4509
03:27:06,620 --> 03:27:10,000
I only felt truly alive when I was staring death in the face.

4510
03:27:11,100 --> 03:27:11,920
I don't know.

4511
03:27:12,620 --> 03:27:14,180
Maybe it's written into my genes.

4512
03:27:16,720 --> 03:27:17,720
What about now?

4513
03:27:18,380 --> 03:27:19,340
What about now?

4514
03:27:19,340 --> 03:27:20,120
I want to enjoy life.

4515
03:27:20,940 --> 03:27:21,960
I really do.

4516
03:27:22,300 --> 03:27:22,600
Aww.

4517
03:27:23,300 --> 03:27:24,420
How about you, Otacon?

4518
03:27:25,160 --> 03:27:25,680
Me?

4519
03:27:28,580 --> 03:27:30,180
I feel like a new man.

4520
03:27:30,620 --> 03:27:31,740
So what are you going to do?

4521
03:27:33,240 --> 03:27:34,320
Continue your research?

4522
03:27:35,080 --> 03:27:36,920
No, I'm finished with science.

4523
03:27:37,120 --> 03:27:39,180
I'm interested in human psychology now.

4524
03:27:39,420 --> 03:27:39,740
Wow.

4525
03:27:40,160 --> 03:27:40,920
Sounds good.

4526
03:27:41,180 --> 03:27:41,900
Sounds good.

4527
03:27:42,040 --> 03:27:45,700
The whole reason I got into science in the first place was because I was no good with people.

4528
03:27:45,960 --> 03:27:46,320
Aww.

4529
03:27:47,760 --> 03:27:49,120
I was scared of them.

4530
03:27:49,260 --> 03:27:49,660
Same.

4531
03:27:49,900 --> 03:27:50,260
It's okay.

4532
03:27:50,260 --> 03:27:51,120
I was scared of life.

4533
03:27:51,460 --> 03:27:51,940
Same.

4534
03:27:52,220 --> 03:27:53,280
Well, you know.

4535
03:27:53,340 --> 03:27:56,420
I thought that I could never understand them because they're so illogical.

4536
03:27:59,400 --> 03:28:01,400
But I finally learned how to like people.

4537
03:28:02,520 --> 03:28:03,540
You don't need people.

4538
03:28:03,640 --> 03:28:04,600
You have an anime waifu now.

4539
03:28:04,600 --> 03:28:05,020
I'm not afraid anymore.

4540
03:28:05,300 --> 03:28:05,680
It's okay.

4541
03:28:06,160 --> 03:28:08,020
You and I are more alike than I thought.

4542
03:28:09,180 --> 03:28:11,960
I'm just tired of always being a spectator in life.

4543
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:14,040
I'm ready to live.

4544
03:28:15,340 --> 03:28:17,280
I'm going to stand on my own two feet.

4545
03:28:17,520 --> 03:28:17,840
Aww.

4546
03:28:18,600 --> 03:28:20,100
I'm not going to hide anymore.

4547
03:28:20,580 --> 03:28:22,180
You giving up your stealth camo?

4548
03:28:23,420 --> 03:28:23,860
Huh?

4549
03:28:23,860 --> 03:28:25,320
Can I have it?

4550
03:28:25,340 --> 03:28:25,640
Oh yeah.

4551
03:28:26,300 --> 03:28:27,320
Can I have it?

4552
03:28:27,420 --> 03:28:28,140
You can have it.

4553
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:28,500
Yippee!

4554
03:28:30,600 --> 03:28:32,080
Oh my god.

4555
03:28:38,690 --> 03:28:40,090
Beaks kill my heart.

4556
03:28:40,430 --> 03:28:42,970
This is where we say goodbye to our loves as well.

4557
03:28:44,370 --> 03:28:45,230
Want me to drive?

4558
03:28:46,010 --> 03:28:46,750
No thanks.

4559
03:28:47,010 --> 03:28:48,070
I'd rather do it myself.

4560
03:28:48,710 --> 03:28:49,570
No problem.

4561
03:28:50,590 --> 03:28:51,830
Where to, Snake?

4562
03:28:52,310 --> 03:28:52,690
Oh.

4563
03:28:54,010 --> 03:28:56,270
My real name is Mint Otacon.

4564
03:28:56,610 --> 03:28:57,490
I'm Hal, Dave.

4565
03:28:58,270 --> 03:28:59,170
Well, that's right.

4566
03:28:59,670 --> 03:29:00,230
Hal.

4567
03:29:01,630 --> 03:29:02,530
Hal and Dave.

4568
03:29:02,690 --> 03:29:03,370
That's a good one.

4569
03:29:03,850 --> 03:29:04,270
And Mint.

4570
03:29:07,170 --> 03:29:09,030
Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter.

4571
03:29:11,990 --> 03:29:13,250
So where you going, Dave?

4572
03:29:13,370 --> 03:29:13,550
Mint.

4573
03:29:14,590 --> 03:29:17,110
I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life.

4574
03:29:17,110 --> 03:29:18,190
A new path?

4575
03:29:18,490 --> 03:29:19,470
There's such dorks.

4576
03:29:19,470 --> 03:29:19,910
A new purpose.

4577
03:29:20,330 --> 03:29:21,770
There's such dorks.

4578
03:29:21,770 --> 03:29:21,990
Will you find it?

4579
03:29:21,990 --> 03:29:22,750
I'll find it.

4580
03:29:24,450 --> 03:29:25,350
What does that mean?

4581
03:29:26,430 --> 03:29:27,750
It's a reference to...

4582
03:29:27,750 --> 03:29:28,670
I know I'll find it.

4583
03:29:29,130 --> 03:29:29,550
To...

4584
03:29:31,430 --> 03:29:31,870
Odyssey.

4585
03:29:32,450 --> 03:29:32,890
2000.

4586
03:29:33,350 --> 03:29:33,950
Oh my gosh.

4587
03:29:34,270 --> 03:29:34,710
2000.

4588
03:29:34,850 --> 03:29:35,950
A space odyssey.

4589
03:29:36,390 --> 03:29:36,830
2001.

4590
03:29:36,910 --> 03:29:37,350
Sorry.

4591
03:29:37,430 --> 03:29:37,750
2001.

4592
03:29:37,750 --> 03:29:38,710
A space odyssey.

4593
03:29:43,410 --> 03:29:43,850
Yay!

4594
03:29:47,390 --> 03:29:51,470
In the 1980s there were more than 60,000 nuclear warheads in the world at all times.

4595
03:29:51,650 --> 03:29:54,950
The total destructive power amounted to 1 million times that of the Hiroshima A-bomb.

4596
03:29:55,390 --> 03:30:04,510
In January 1993 START II was signed and the United States and Russia agreed to reduce the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 by December something...

4597
03:30:04,510 --> 03:30:05,250
December 3rd.

4598
03:30:05,270 --> 03:30:09,410
However, as of 1998 there still exists 26,000 nuclear warheads in the world.

4599
03:30:15,590 --> 03:30:16,110
And...

4600
03:30:16,110 --> 03:30:16,430
Ugh.

4601
03:30:16,510 --> 03:30:17,230
Text too fast.

4602
03:30:17,630 --> 03:30:17,870
Ah!

4603
03:30:21,490 --> 03:30:22,690
Congrats on being in the game.

4604
03:30:22,690 --> 03:30:23,230
Thank you, Nashi!

4605
03:30:25,750 --> 03:30:26,790
Congrats on being in the game.

4606
03:30:26,790 --> 03:30:26,790
Thank you, Nashi!

4607
03:30:26,790 --> 03:30:27,790
Boo, politics?

4608
03:30:27,890 --> 03:30:29,690
Yo, don't get into Metal Gear then.

4609
03:30:31,050 --> 03:30:32,790
Metal Gear is all politics.

4610
03:30:33,970 --> 03:30:34,990
Metal Gear is all politics.

4611
03:30:40,100 --> 03:30:42,040
I love this song so much.

4612
03:30:42,860 --> 03:30:43,620
I love this song so much.

4613
03:30:43,620 --> 03:30:44,280
Congrats on the cabinet.

4614
03:30:45,380 --> 03:30:45,580
Congrats on the cabinet.

4615
03:30:46,080 --> 03:30:46,600
Ah!

4616
03:30:55,290 --> 03:30:55,810
Liquid...

4617
03:30:55,810 --> 03:30:58,170
Beating Liquid up was the hardest boss.

4618
03:30:58,690 --> 03:30:58,710
Beating Liquid up was the hardest boss.

4619
03:31:01,330 --> 03:31:01,850
Ow!

4620
03:31:02,090 --> 03:31:03,030
Thanks for the five gifted!

4621
03:31:04,150 --> 03:31:06,150
How much gas is in that snowmobile?

4622
03:31:06,910 --> 03:31:08,290
They're going to Fox Island.

4623
03:31:09,430 --> 03:31:10,210
There's a helicopter.

4624
03:31:10,230 --> 03:31:10,650
There's a helicopter there.

4625
03:31:19,290 --> 03:31:20,690
Looks bad.

4626
03:31:20,770 --> 03:31:21,550
CQC rad.

4627
03:31:21,850 --> 03:31:22,610
Details inside.

4628
03:31:25,110 --> 03:31:26,710
Here it goes.

4629
03:31:29,900 --> 03:31:31,150
That was early.

4630
03:31:36,290 --> 03:31:37,510
We did it!

4631
03:31:37,570 --> 03:31:38,470
Whatever it is!

4632
03:31:40,730 --> 03:31:41,170
Chuu!

4633
03:31:41,810 --> 03:31:44,670
New headcanon minted as a ghost because Otacon fell in love with it.

4634
03:31:47,130 --> 03:31:48,230
Oh my god, that's brutal.

4635
03:31:48,470 --> 03:31:49,650
Congrats on being in the game again.

4636
03:31:49,850 --> 03:31:50,310
Thank you!

4637
03:31:51,590 --> 03:31:53,310
Didn't have comedic Otacon fall.

4638
03:31:53,490 --> 03:31:53,950
So true.

4639
03:31:58,470 --> 03:31:59,830
Oh, little go-

4640
03:32:03,980 --> 03:32:05,740
Oh, this song makes me cry.

4641
03:32:07,900 --> 03:32:08,340
Panda!

4642
03:32:08,540 --> 03:32:09,480
Thanks for the 20 gifted!

4643
03:32:09,540 --> 03:32:10,100
Thank you!

4644
03:32:11,240 --> 03:32:12,100
Thank you!

4645
03:32:12,480 --> 03:32:13,780
S1, thank you for the 10.

4646
03:32:14,480 --> 03:32:15,760
Thank you so much.

4647
03:32:16,880 --> 03:32:17,360
Man...

4648
03:32:18,440 --> 03:32:20,300
Mint mod made this 10 times better.

4649
03:32:21,220 --> 03:32:23,400
I thought it would be fun to kind of...

4650
03:32:23,400 --> 03:32:27,000
It wasn't my intention to save it for the finale but...

4651
03:32:27,740 --> 03:32:32,520
I really wanted to make it possible for the finale.

4652
03:32:32,680 --> 03:32:35,080
If you heard that, that was my controller disconnecting.

4653
03:32:35,080 --> 03:32:35,680
Haha...

4654
03:32:38,120 --> 03:32:38,680
Ha...

4655
03:32:40,040 --> 03:32:40,600
Ha...

4656
03:32:42,720 --> 03:32:44,380
Oooh, it's a moose!

4657
03:32:44,560 --> 03:32:46,360
I mean, just a singular moose.

4658
03:32:48,580 --> 03:32:49,140
Mushroom!

4659
03:32:50,700 --> 03:32:52,860
You protected the world from devastation.

4660
03:32:53,780 --> 03:32:55,480
United all nations within our...

4661
03:32:55,480 --> 03:32:55,900
Wait...

4662
03:32:55,900 --> 03:32:58,140
Within our nation.

4663
03:32:59,620 --> 03:33:01,340
Renounced the evils of truth and love.

4664
03:33:02,560 --> 03:33:04,360
Extended our reach to the skies above.

4665
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:05,960
Minto!

4666
03:33:06,940 --> 03:33:07,300
Otacon!

4667
03:33:11,840 --> 03:33:13,740
United all nations within our nation.

4668
03:33:14,060 --> 03:33:15,120
Wait, is that actually it?

4669
03:33:22,350 --> 03:33:23,870
You know this place is kind of beautiful.

4670
03:33:24,050 --> 03:33:26,570
No, I don't mean the flaming wreckage of dead bodies we left behind us.

4671
03:33:26,610 --> 03:33:27,050
I mean Alaska!

4672
03:33:29,930 --> 03:33:30,590
Metal Gear...

4673
03:33:32,230 --> 03:33:33,910
Mega64's Metal Gear Solid in 5 minutes.

4674
03:33:33,910 --> 03:33:38,010
Actually, Mega64 will be at MGSCon.

4675
03:33:38,450 --> 03:33:46,110
And they, like, Rocko tweeted out, he was just like, getting ready for MGSCon, we realized that we save everything.

4676
03:33:47,590 --> 03:33:51,450
And so, I wonder what they'll be bringing to the convention.

4677
03:33:51,670 --> 03:33:54,730
I wonder maybe some secret stuff from when they did like the commercials.

4678
03:33:56,170 --> 03:34:00,270
Like some props and stuff when they did the commercials for MGS4.

4679
03:34:01,190 --> 03:34:02,090
It's pretty neat.

4680
03:34:02,830 --> 03:34:03,890
I always preferred the commercials.

4681
03:34:03,910 --> 03:34:07,130
Can and Meryl ending since Otacon gets the cool self-sacrifice moment.

4682
03:34:08,810 --> 03:34:09,750
I mean...

4683
03:34:09,750 --> 03:34:11,970
He doesn't sacrifice himself.

4684
03:34:12,210 --> 03:34:12,990
I mean, he still lives.

4685
03:34:13,130 --> 03:34:13,890
But you know, I get it.

4686
03:34:14,630 --> 03:34:17,030
Congrats on beating MGS and getting an otaku BF!

4687
03:34:19,090 --> 03:34:20,910
I would tame Otacon, I would.

4688
03:34:22,070 --> 03:34:23,710
Very close to finishing Peace Walker.

4689
03:34:24,470 --> 03:34:26,870
The ending of Peace Walker is so...

4690
03:34:27,990 --> 03:34:28,530
frustrating.

4691
03:34:29,290 --> 03:34:30,450
And so good.

4692
03:34:31,230 --> 03:34:32,450
And so beautiful.

4693
03:34:33,910 --> 03:34:34,950
I love it, I love it.

4694
03:34:35,030 --> 03:34:36,470
Thank you for all the superchats!

4695
03:34:37,090 --> 03:34:40,190
Raven's choice of the GAU-8 as his main weapon is comical.

4696
03:34:40,270 --> 03:34:45,150
It's too heavy, ammo hungry, and long to be useful in this boss arena.

4697
03:34:48,710 --> 03:34:52,050
I mean, it's a good workout, you know?

4698
03:34:53,370 --> 03:34:55,310
Will you play as the angsty pretty boy next?

4699
03:34:55,430 --> 03:34:55,910
Of course!

4700
03:34:56,890 --> 03:34:59,710
So not this Saturday, but next Saturday.

4701
03:35:01,390 --> 03:35:02,390
The 13th.

4702
03:35:02,510 --> 03:35:05,730
We will continue Metal Gear Saturdays.

4703
03:35:07,090 --> 03:35:07,590
With...

4704
03:35:08,770 --> 03:35:09,270
Wait.

4705
03:35:09,890 --> 03:35:10,390
Yeah.

4706
03:35:11,230 --> 03:35:14,090
The 13th with Metal Gear Solid 2!

4707
03:35:16,350 --> 03:35:18,190
I wish I had started it in April.

4708
03:35:20,770 --> 03:35:22,930
I wish I had started it in April.

4709
03:35:24,830 --> 03:35:26,990
So I could play it on April 30th.

4710
03:35:27,210 --> 03:35:28,370
But that's okay too.

4711
03:35:29,710 --> 03:35:30,290
Octopus Pie!

4712
03:35:31,870 --> 03:35:33,630
Big shoutouts to Virasek and...

4713
03:35:34,690 --> 03:35:35,210
Jebbles?

4714
03:35:36,250 --> 03:35:36,770
Yes!

4715
03:35:36,770 --> 03:35:37,910
Thank you, Virasek!

4716
03:35:37,990 --> 03:35:38,850
Thank you, Jeremy.

4717
03:35:38,970 --> 03:35:43,270
Thank you both so, so, so much for putting this all together.

4718
03:35:43,590 --> 03:35:44,310
Doing the...

4719
03:35:45,490 --> 03:35:47,410
Virasek, you are so cracked.

4720
03:35:47,710 --> 03:35:48,110
You are...

4721
03:35:48,110 --> 03:35:58,230
I remember when the tweet went out about the mod, multiple people messaged me being like Did you see this?

4722
03:35:58,470 --> 03:36:00,610
You mustn't allow yourself to be chained to fate.

4723
03:36:00,790 --> 03:36:02,710
To be ruled by your genes.

4724
03:36:03,530 --> 03:36:04,490
Humans can choose the type of life they want to live.

4725
03:36:04,490 --> 03:36:05,730
It's like a dream come true, honestly.

4726
03:36:06,250 --> 03:36:07,850
Seeing myself in the game.

4727
03:36:07,930 --> 03:36:08,130
So thank you!

4728
03:36:08,130 --> 03:36:10,330
The important thing is that you choose life.

4729
03:36:11,070 --> 03:36:12,370
And then live.

4730
03:36:13,790 --> 03:36:14,630
Thanks, Naomi.

4731
03:36:19,430 --> 03:36:20,510
Metal Gear Solid...

4732
03:36:23,370 --> 03:36:24,330
Yes, sir.

4733
03:36:24,750 --> 03:36:26,790
The entire unit was wiped out.

4734
03:36:27,710 --> 03:36:28,710
No, sir.

4735
03:36:29,850 --> 03:36:30,030
Still alive.

4736
03:36:30,950 --> 03:36:31,990
The Vector?

4737
03:36:32,130 --> 03:36:32,970
Yes, sir.

4738
03:36:33,110 --> 03:36:33,950
Yes, sir.

4739
03:36:34,130 --> 03:36:37,170
Right on schedule.

4740
03:36:38,230 --> 03:36:39,190
Yes, sir.

4741
03:36:39,230 --> 03:36:39,610
Yes, sir.

4742
03:36:39,710 --> 03:36:42,350
I recovered all of Rex's dummy warhead data.

4743
03:36:42,790 --> 03:36:43,730
No, sir.

4744
03:36:44,110 --> 03:36:44,970
No, sir.

4745
03:36:45,110 --> 03:36:46,310
My cover is intact.

4746
03:36:46,730 --> 03:36:48,290
Nobody knows who I really am.

4747
03:36:48,650 --> 03:36:49,510
Yes, sir.

4748
03:36:50,770 --> 03:36:53,170
Yes, the DARPA chief knew my identity.

4749
03:36:53,430 --> 03:36:55,050
But he's been disposed of.

4750
03:36:55,870 --> 03:36:56,750
Yes, sir.

4751
03:36:57,370 --> 03:36:58,010
Yes.

4752
03:36:58,290 --> 03:36:59,230
Thank you.

4753
03:36:59,850 --> 03:37:00,230
I'm getting it right.

4754
03:37:01,510 --> 03:37:02,710
Mr. President.

4755
03:37:05,640 --> 03:37:05,950
What's that?

4756
03:37:07,150 --> 03:37:09,150
Ocelot talking to the President?

4757
03:37:17,780 --> 03:37:19,400
What does that mean?

4758
03:37:19,720 --> 03:37:20,000
Oh, wait.

4759
03:37:20,180 --> 03:37:21,060
This isn't my...

4760
03:37:21,060 --> 03:37:21,600
Wait.

4761
03:37:24,540 --> 03:37:25,780
This isn't my...

4762
03:37:25,780 --> 03:37:27,040
This isn't my save.

4763
03:37:27,480 --> 03:37:28,740
What would I have been?

4764
03:37:30,720 --> 03:37:32,140
I guess we'll never know.

4765
03:37:32,140 --> 03:37:32,260
I guess we'll never know.

4766
03:37:33,860 --> 03:37:34,240
No.

4767
03:37:34,360 --> 03:37:36,980
In my free time, I'll beat it on my normal account.

4768
03:37:37,280 --> 03:37:37,460
No.

4769
03:37:37,740 --> 03:37:38,120
In my free time, I'll beat it on my normal account.

4770
03:37:38,120 --> 03:37:38,280
Not account.

4771
03:37:38,540 --> 03:37:40,640
On my normal... on the Master Collection.

4772
03:37:40,640 --> 03:37:41,580
And I'll tell you guys.

4773
03:37:42,800 --> 03:37:45,040
I'll beat it in my... well, whenever I have free time.

4774
03:37:45,280 --> 03:37:45,440
I'll beat it in my...

4775
03:37:45,440 --> 03:37:45,440
well, whenever I have free time.

4776
03:37:45,900 --> 03:37:47,340
But I'll let you guys know.

4777
03:37:47,420 --> 03:37:48,300
I'll let you guys know.

4778
03:37:52,120 --> 03:37:54,080
What does leopard mean anyway, though?

4779
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:00,760
Finishing the game in 5 hours is nuts?

4780
03:38:00,760 --> 03:38:01,200
No, no.

4781
03:38:01,280 --> 03:38:02,280
I did not do that.

4782
03:38:04,140 --> 03:38:05,520
I did not do that.

4783
03:38:05,780 --> 03:38:06,700
I did not do that.

4784
03:38:06,780 --> 03:38:07,300
Cat.

4785
03:38:07,700 --> 03:38:08,060
No.

4786
03:38:08,200 --> 03:38:09,260
Shut up, you guys.

4787
03:38:11,620 --> 03:38:12,420
Shut up!

4788
03:38:14,240 --> 03:38:15,500
Really good stats.

4789
03:38:15,760 --> 03:38:17,440
Really good stats.

4790
03:38:17,440 --> 03:38:17,480
Well.

4791
03:38:18,060 --> 03:38:21,340
I had to still have really good stats to finish the game.

4792
03:38:21,660 --> 03:38:22,020
So...

4793
03:38:24,160 --> 03:38:24,680
Yippee!

4794
03:38:25,680 --> 03:38:26,200
Oh.

4795
03:38:30,080 --> 03:38:31,500
There we go.

4796
03:38:31,740 --> 03:38:32,420
Connected.

4797
03:38:33,620 --> 03:38:33,960
Yes.

4798
03:38:34,500 --> 03:38:35,180
Yes.

4799
03:38:35,400 --> 03:38:37,880
The end credits song was sung in Irish.

4800
03:38:38,120 --> 03:38:38,500
I know.

4801
03:38:42,760 --> 03:38:44,520
That's why I've never sung it before.

4802
03:38:45,260 --> 03:38:46,580
I've seen...

4803
03:38:50,280 --> 03:38:51,620
What's Pocket Station?

4804
03:38:55,440 --> 03:38:56,120
What's Pocket Station?

4805
03:38:56,120 --> 03:38:56,460
What's Pocket Station?

4806
03:39:00,270 --> 03:39:01,630
What's Pocket Station?

4807
03:39:01,630 --> 03:39:01,890
The Story Card.

4808
03:39:03,110 --> 03:39:08,090
I've seen some English covers done of The Best Is Yet To Come.

4809
03:39:08,410 --> 03:39:08,570
But...

4810
03:39:10,190 --> 03:39:10,630
Hmm...

4811
03:39:13,450 --> 03:39:13,890
Uh...

4812
03:39:14,870 --> 03:39:15,310
But...

4813
03:39:15,310 --> 03:39:16,170
Um...

4814
03:39:18,410 --> 03:39:19,110
I don't know.

4815
03:39:19,330 --> 03:39:20,570
I would have to...

4816
03:39:21,030 --> 03:39:21,650
I don't know.

4817
03:39:21,970 --> 03:39:24,850
I feel like I would have to mess around with it a little bit.

4818
03:39:24,990 --> 03:39:26,270
I know Donna Burke has one too.

4819
03:39:26,490 --> 03:39:26,930
So...

4820
03:39:29,210 --> 03:39:30,650
I'm just gonna go to here.

4821
03:39:38,220 --> 03:39:38,740
Oh!

4822
03:39:39,040 --> 03:39:39,560
Demo!

4823
03:39:39,580 --> 03:39:40,040
Wait.

4824
03:39:40,300 --> 03:39:41,220
Does this work?

4825
03:39:44,240 --> 03:39:44,760
Oh.

4826
03:39:45,100 --> 03:39:46,580
It's just the Otacon ending.

4827
03:39:47,800 --> 03:39:48,580
Never mind.

4828
03:39:51,120 --> 03:39:52,500
The original just hits.

4829
03:39:52,640 --> 03:39:53,140
It really does.

4830
03:39:54,420 --> 03:39:55,400
It really does.

4831
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:57,180
One player view mode.

4832
03:39:57,320 --> 03:39:58,120
What is that anyway?

4833
03:39:58,260 --> 03:39:59,020
One player view mode.

4834
03:40:02,460 --> 03:40:03,340
Well guys!

4835
03:40:04,240 --> 03:40:04,480
I did it!

4836
03:40:04,980 --> 03:40:05,980
Good work boss!

4837
03:40:06,160 --> 03:40:06,720
Thank you!

4838
03:40:08,520 --> 03:40:09,180
Thank you!

4839
03:40:11,080 --> 03:40:13,000
Even with performance anxiety!

4840
03:40:14,840 --> 03:40:15,880
First person view?

4841
03:40:16,240 --> 03:40:16,580
Wait.

4842
03:40:16,640 --> 03:40:17,000
No way.

4843
03:40:25,860 --> 03:40:27,080
I wanna see what it's like.

4844
03:40:28,280 --> 03:40:30,140
Very important to me ever since I was 8 years old.

4845
03:40:30,280 --> 03:40:31,080
I'm so happy.

4846
03:40:31,440 --> 03:40:32,200
To be...

4847
03:40:32,200 --> 03:40:33,380
Oh no!

4848
03:40:33,380 --> 03:40:34,440
It's telling me to...

4849
03:40:34,440 --> 03:40:36,020
Telling me to put a disc one.

4850
03:40:36,320 --> 03:40:36,700
Oh.

4851
03:40:37,840 --> 03:40:38,480
Oh.

4852
03:40:39,340 --> 03:40:39,980
Oh.

4853
03:40:40,320 --> 03:40:40,960
Oh.

4854
03:40:41,960 --> 03:40:42,600
Oh.

4855
03:40:43,780 --> 03:40:44,420
Oh.

4856
03:40:48,180 --> 03:40:49,820
There is no...

4857
03:40:49,820 --> 03:40:50,520
Oh.

4858
03:40:51,800 --> 03:40:52,440
Ah.

4859
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:55,640
Ah.

4860
03:40:58,100 --> 03:40:58,740
Well.

4861
03:40:58,940 --> 03:40:59,960
Alt F4 time.

4862
03:41:01,500 --> 03:41:02,300
You know what?

4863
03:41:02,300 --> 03:41:02,680
That's fine.

4864
03:41:02,780 --> 03:41:03,480
We finished it.

4865
03:41:05,000 --> 03:41:06,220
Goodbye Metal Gear.

4866
03:41:06,840 --> 03:41:07,280
No.

4867
03:41:07,360 --> 03:41:08,560
Don't leave me Metal Gear.

4868
03:41:08,680 --> 03:41:09,540
I love you Metal Gear!

4869
03:41:11,500 --> 03:41:12,900
I love you Metal Gear.

4870
03:41:14,520 --> 03:41:15,400
Ah man.

4871
03:41:16,380 --> 03:41:17,460
I'm gonna move you guys.

4872
03:41:18,940 --> 03:41:20,320
I can't talk for too long.

4873
03:41:20,380 --> 03:41:21,700
Just because I have...

4874
03:41:22,740 --> 03:41:24,160
To get ready for...

4875
03:41:26,220 --> 03:41:26,660
Leaving.

4876
03:41:28,220 --> 03:41:29,620
We can talk a little bit.

4877
03:41:29,700 --> 03:41:29,940
Okay.

4878
03:41:30,420 --> 03:41:31,540
Congrats on beating the game.

4879
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:34,060
Will you be doing Ghost Bobble before or after MGS2?

4880
03:41:34,680 --> 03:41:35,080
Oh!

4881
03:41:36,380 --> 03:41:36,780
Oh.

4882
03:41:36,780 --> 03:41:37,100
Whoops.

4883
03:41:37,960 --> 03:41:38,360
No.

4884
03:41:38,480 --> 03:41:39,160
Not my headband.

4885
03:41:39,360 --> 03:41:40,280
My headband and ammo.

4886
03:41:41,180 --> 03:41:41,580
Um.

4887
03:41:44,200 --> 03:41:44,960
Probably after.

4888
03:41:45,080 --> 03:41:46,260
I'll probably go through the main series.

4889
03:41:47,380 --> 03:41:49,240
And then do the other games.

4890
03:41:49,260 --> 03:41:51,400
Like Acid and Ghost Bobble and stuff like that.

4891
03:41:51,660 --> 03:41:52,500
So it's a treat to watch.

4892
03:41:52,540 --> 03:41:53,680
Looking forward to the rest of the franchise.

4893
03:41:53,840 --> 03:41:55,420
I could honestly watch people play these games forever.

4894
03:41:55,700 --> 03:41:56,080
There's...

4895
03:41:56,080 --> 03:41:56,640
Yeah!

4896
03:41:57,080 --> 03:41:57,780
Me too!

4897
03:42:00,380 --> 03:42:01,380
Just wanna let you know...

4898
03:42:01,380 --> 03:42:01,620
Oh wait.

4899
03:42:01,680 --> 03:42:01,940
Hold on.

4900
03:42:01,960 --> 03:42:03,000
Let me put on some music real quick.

4901
03:42:04,440 --> 03:42:05,740
Let me put on some music.

4902
03:42:14,000 --> 03:42:20,020
There we go.

4903
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:23,400
I have started the first part of rendering the beeswax!

4904
03:42:24,480 --> 03:42:26,760
It's like a few days to get to the point where I can make it into a candle.

4905
03:42:26,860 --> 03:42:27,960
I'll be blessed to update you.

4906
03:42:28,080 --> 03:42:28,580
Oh my gosh!

4907
03:42:28,920 --> 03:42:29,340
Let's go!

4908
03:42:29,940 --> 03:42:30,260
Beeswax!

4909
03:42:32,760 --> 03:42:33,860
André goes thanks for the pink!

4910
03:42:34,140 --> 03:42:35,920
It was so much fun watching you play through the game.

4911
03:42:35,940 --> 03:42:36,500
Thanks for the stream.

4912
03:42:36,540 --> 03:42:37,480
Looking forward to the next game.

4913
03:42:37,600 --> 03:42:38,160
Thank you!

4914
03:42:39,600 --> 03:42:39,920
Nibi!

4915
03:42:42,620 --> 03:42:43,720
I'm glad that...

4916
03:42:43,720 --> 03:42:43,980
Um...

4917
03:42:45,760 --> 03:42:46,080
That...

4918
03:42:47,020 --> 03:42:49,200
I didn't take like two hours on Rex.

4919
03:42:52,600 --> 03:42:53,120
I'm glad.

4920
03:42:53,180 --> 03:42:53,380
I'm glad.

4921
03:42:53,400 --> 03:42:54,380
Great job, boss!

4922
03:42:54,460 --> 03:42:56,400
I can't make it to the concert, but I'll be cheering in spirit.

4923
03:42:57,600 --> 03:43:00,540
Hope you have time to visit AX and pick up some merch.

4924
03:43:00,640 --> 03:43:01,920
I think BA is going to have a booth.

4925
03:43:02,020 --> 03:43:02,340
They are!

4926
03:43:02,700 --> 03:43:06,220
I honestly don't even know if I'm going to be able to go to the con.

4927
03:43:07,700 --> 03:43:08,380
I honestly don't even know if I'm going to be able to go to the con.

4928
03:43:08,380 --> 03:43:09,060
I actually have so much to do.

4929
03:43:09,400 --> 03:43:10,800
So I'm just kind of like...

4930
03:43:14,960 --> 03:43:16,700
But if I do, cool.

4931
03:43:16,820 --> 03:43:18,200
If I don't, that's okay too.

4932
03:43:18,460 --> 03:43:23,920
Honestly, if I don't, it saves me a big headache from having to walk into AX.

4933
03:43:27,500 --> 03:43:28,780
So, honestly...

4934
03:43:28,780 --> 03:43:30,160
It's worth.

4935
03:43:31,200 --> 03:43:34,560
Tomorrow, I have my first ever...

4936
03:43:34,560 --> 03:43:35,820
Wait, hold on.

4937
03:43:36,020 --> 03:43:38,000
I have my first ever...

4938
03:43:40,300 --> 03:43:40,940
Vlog!

4939
03:43:43,380 --> 03:43:45,400
I went to a maid cafe!

4940
03:43:46,400 --> 03:43:48,820
And I am reporting on it.

4941
03:43:50,180 --> 03:43:50,820
So...

4942
03:43:52,180 --> 03:43:53,180
If you are watching an AX war...

4943
03:43:54,960 --> 03:43:56,760
Or not even just AX war...

4944
03:43:56,760 --> 03:43:57,640
Just watch it.

4945
03:44:00,080 --> 03:44:01,120
Just watch it.

4946
03:44:03,240 --> 03:44:03,760
Vlog!

4947
03:44:04,280 --> 03:44:07,940
I possessed someone and I made her go for me.

4948
03:44:08,220 --> 03:44:08,640
So...

4949
03:44:10,960 --> 03:44:12,060
I'm just like...

4950
03:44:12,060 --> 03:44:13,600
I'm like inside this...

4951
03:44:14,140 --> 03:44:16,360
They never knew that I was a ghost the whole time.

4952
03:44:18,420 --> 03:44:19,840
They never knew...

4953
03:44:19,840 --> 03:44:22,060
That I was a ghost inside someone's body.

4954
03:44:23,180 --> 03:44:24,720
Did you ask for consent?

4955
03:44:25,280 --> 03:44:26,320
Did you ask for consent?

4956
03:44:44,360 --> 03:44:46,380
I'm sure she enjoyed the trip.

4957
03:44:47,380 --> 03:44:49,620
I wonder if Mint will ever watch Escape from L.A.

4958
03:44:50,480 --> 03:44:51,180
No, no.

4959
03:44:51,680 --> 03:44:53,140
Not Escape from L.A.

4960
03:44:53,140 --> 03:44:54,060
Escape from New York!

4961
03:44:54,640 --> 03:44:56,640
The actual movie that inspired the Solid series.

4962
03:44:56,960 --> 03:44:58,800
I have seen Escape from New York though.

4963
03:44:58,960 --> 03:45:00,300
I have not seen Escape from L.A.

4964
03:45:00,320 --> 03:45:01,660
Which is Escape from New York 2.

4965
03:45:04,100 --> 03:45:05,900
But I have, I have.

4966
03:45:08,360 --> 03:45:14,620
I'm gonna commission art in advance of you playing Acid in my ongoing campaign to girl boss, gatekeep, and gaslight you into playing Acid too.

4967
03:45:14,680 --> 03:45:16,320
I will play Acid eventually.

4968
03:45:16,520 --> 03:45:17,820
I'm gonna not enjoy it.

4969
03:45:17,920 --> 03:45:20,140
I'm not gonna have fun with Acid.

4970
03:45:20,180 --> 03:45:21,240
But I will play it.

4971
03:45:24,080 --> 03:45:25,420
Fake fan corrected.

4972
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:27,600
I...

4973
03:45:28,160 --> 03:45:29,300
Am a ffff...

4974
03:45:29,300 --> 03:45:30,140
Fan.

4975
03:45:30,820 --> 03:45:32,340
I was not gonna say...

4976
03:45:32,340 --> 03:45:33,740
I was like I am a fake fan.

4977
03:45:33,740 --> 03:45:34,720
But then I was like, wait a second.

4978
03:45:34,800 --> 03:45:35,740
No, I'm not.

4979
03:45:37,540 --> 03:45:39,480
Thanks for reminding me about AX.

4980
03:45:39,500 --> 03:45:41,000
I will be avoiding downtown L.A.

4981
03:45:41,080 --> 03:45:41,480
on Friday.

4982
03:45:41,840 --> 03:45:43,060
But that's where...

4983
03:45:43,060 --> 03:45:44,540
My concert is.

4984
03:45:46,040 --> 03:45:46,440
Theocrats.

4985
03:45:46,720 --> 03:45:47,540
We have to go.

4986
03:45:51,300 --> 03:45:52,000
Or not.

4987
03:45:52,080 --> 03:45:53,000
You don't have to go.

4988
03:45:53,180 --> 03:45:53,720
But you know.

4989
03:45:55,380 --> 03:45:56,080
But you know.

4990
03:45:56,560 --> 03:45:57,320
It will be fun.

4991
03:45:58,160 --> 03:45:59,160
It will be a fun time.

4992
03:46:02,520 --> 03:46:02,920
Yeah.

4993
03:46:03,740 --> 03:46:04,700
I will be performing at a concert on Friday.

4994
03:46:04,940 --> 03:46:06,460
Which I'm very excited about.

4995
03:46:06,600 --> 03:46:07,740
I'm very nervous about.

4996
03:46:07,920 --> 03:46:09,220
I was practicing today.

4997
03:46:10,120 --> 03:46:11,120
And everything.

4998
03:46:11,620 --> 03:46:13,900
But I have to also pack.

4999
03:46:14,900 --> 03:46:16,060
Oh my god.

5000
03:46:16,100 --> 03:46:16,300
No!

5001
03:46:16,500 --> 03:46:19,480
I have to throw the rest of my laundry in the...

5002
03:46:19,480 --> 03:46:20,320
In the dryer!

5003
03:46:20,820 --> 03:46:21,460
Okay guys.

5004
03:46:21,600 --> 03:46:22,260
I gotta get going.

5005
03:46:22,400 --> 03:46:24,800
So I can make sure that my clothes dry on time.

5006
03:46:26,060 --> 03:46:28,980
Thank you guys for Metal Gear Solid.

5007
03:46:29,200 --> 03:46:32,460
I hope you guys were surprised by the Minto model.

5008
03:46:33,740 --> 03:46:34,840
I hope it was fun for you.

5009
03:46:35,060 --> 03:46:36,820
And we did it baby!

5010
03:46:37,540 --> 03:46:40,120
In less than 4 hours.

5011
03:46:40,560 --> 03:46:41,860
Got through Vulcan Raven.

5012
03:46:42,200 --> 03:46:43,100
The Palkis.

5013
03:46:43,500 --> 03:46:43,980
Rex.

5014
03:46:45,360 --> 03:46:45,840
Liquid.

5015
03:46:46,200 --> 03:46:46,840
The car.

5016
03:46:47,160 --> 03:46:48,060
We did it baby.

5017
03:46:48,400 --> 03:46:49,840
We did it.

5018
03:46:50,080 --> 03:46:51,080
Good job to us.

5019
03:46:53,040 --> 03:46:54,160
Thank you so much.

5020
03:46:54,440 --> 03:46:56,120
And I hope you guys have a great night.

5021
03:46:56,280 --> 03:46:57,140
A great day.

5022
03:46:57,240 --> 03:46:58,680
If you are in the United States.

5023
03:46:58,720 --> 03:46:59,680
I hope you have tomorrow off.

5024
03:47:01,900 --> 03:47:03,300
And yeah.

5025
03:47:03,660 --> 03:47:06,040
I'm gonna go finish getting ready.

5026
03:47:06,320 --> 03:47:06,780
Oh my god.

5027
03:47:07,720 --> 03:47:09,040
Good night everyone!

5028
03:47:09,800 --> 03:47:10,560
Good night!

5029
03:47:11,410 --> 03:47:11,760
And...

5030
03:47:12,800 --> 03:47:13,880
I'll see you.

5031
03:47:15,880 --> 03:47:17,640
What was I gonna say?

5032
03:47:18,160 --> 03:47:19,140
I'll see you...

5033
03:47:23,200 --> 03:47:24,600
Maybe Sunday.

5034
03:47:25,640 --> 03:47:26,720
Maybe Monday.

5035
03:47:27,360 --> 03:47:28,700
I'm not sure yet.

5036
03:47:28,860 --> 03:47:29,420
I'm gonna try.

5037
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:31,180
Maybe I can do a gorilla stream on Sunday.

5038
03:47:32,940 --> 03:47:33,760
I'm gonna try.

5039
03:47:33,940 --> 03:47:34,600
I'll see how I'm feeling.

5040
03:47:34,880 --> 03:47:36,540
Cause it'll be a busy busy weekend.

5041
03:47:38,000 --> 03:47:38,540
Anyway.

5042
03:47:38,780 --> 03:47:40,420
See you next week!

5043
03:47:41,320 --> 03:47:41,980
Bye bye!

5044
03:47:42,480 --> 03:47:44,320
See you in a few days!

5045
03:47:44,600 --> 03:47:45,080
See you!

5046
03:47:46,360 --> 03:47:47,260
Bye bye!

5047
03:48:34,100 --> 03:48:39,740
Guys why is it every time I go to Twitter I just see like People's Art of Doki Booze.

5048
03:48:40,260 --> 03:48:41,420
What's going on?

5049
03:48:42,740 --> 03:48:44,400
I'm not consenting to this.

5050
03:48:45,500 --> 03:48:48,140
I just see Doki's boobs all over my timeline.

5051
03:48:49,060 --> 03:48:49,540
I just see Doki's boobs all over my timeline.

5052
03:48:49,540 --> 03:48:50,960
Why is this happening to me?

5053
03:48:51,280 --> 03:48:51,400
Why is this happening to me?

5054
03:48:52,560 --> 03:48:53,620
I don't know.

5055
03:48:54,660 --> 03:48:56,940
Why are they all over my timeline?

5056
03:48:58,720 --> 03:48:59,980
Her birthday is tomorrow.

5057
03:49:00,060 --> 03:49:01,540
So she's in her birthday suit.

5058
03:49:01,780 --> 03:49:02,720
Is that what you're telling me?

5059
03:49:02,900 --> 03:49:04,620
Did she do one too?

5060
03:49:05,680 --> 03:49:07,700
No I'm saying nip out.

5061
03:49:09,160 --> 03:49:11,660
I keep seeing art of her with nip out.

5062
03:49:12,820 --> 03:49:14,020
Doki put on a shirt!

5063
03:49:15,880 --> 03:49:16,240
Anyway.

5064
03:49:17,660 --> 03:49:18,260
Not good.

5065
03:49:19,240 --> 03:49:20,460
They are for humans.

5066
03:49:20,680 --> 03:49:21,580
I don't want that!

5067
03:49:21,680 --> 03:49:22,580
I never asked for this!

5068
03:49:24,240 --> 03:49:25,980
Oh yeah wait I did see Oimo's.

5069
03:49:26,040 --> 03:49:28,740
I thought you meant that she did like a NSFW one.

5070
03:49:28,840 --> 03:49:29,580
No I saw that one too!

5071
03:49:31,220 --> 03:49:32,260
Blink so I can avoid.
