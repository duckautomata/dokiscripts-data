1
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,510
Welcome back!

2
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,890
My voice is still kind of...

3
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,150
Clickbait thumbnail.

4
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,150
I said I'm sorry for false advertisement.

5
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,150
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,130
Also I feel like Chibi Minto's head is too big for this game.

7
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,170
It takes up too much space.

8
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,930
She lied.

9
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,550
Where is Lilac?

10
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,030
It's me!

11
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,050
It's who you want to hang out with, right?

12
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,210
It's Mid Phantom.

13
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,570
Everybody cheer!

14
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,890
Squeaky Minto my oshi.

15
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,310
Now my voice is still kind of warped.

16
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,230
But that's okay.

17
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,990
Why do they sound so tortured?

18
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,730
No!

19
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,550
They sound wonderful!

20
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,410
Today, I want to beat Eternal Darkness.

21
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,010
I don't know how much time I have left...

22
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,610
In the game.

23
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,010
Sorry, not...

24
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,250
This sounds so ominous.

25
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:06,890
Guys, I don't know how much time I have left.

26
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,090
My favorite streamer made Mint Paragon.

27
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,490
Are you going to die again?

28
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,750
I'm going to die again.

29
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,750
I'm actually so sleepy today.

30
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,410
I'm sleepy always.

31
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,390
Goodness gracious.

32
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,550
I don't know how much time I have left in the game.

33
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,430
But I want to beat it today.

34
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,190
That's why I'm starting a little bit earlier than my usual streaming times.

35
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,230
Hopefully we beat the game.

36
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:45,970
I really hope so.

37
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,910
Let's start.

38
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,590
No, go back.

39
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,870
Load game.

40
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,570
You got this.

41
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:57,870
Hopefully.

42
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,010
Hopefully.

43
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,270
Let's hope.

44
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,650
Streaming at a somewhat EU inclusive time.

45
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,470
No 7 point Paragon?

46
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,610
I made this last time.

47
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,490
I didn't have time to make... Oh my goodness.

48
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,130
I have a baby crying.

49
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,210
I didn't have time to make another Paragon.

50
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:21,790
I'm sorry.

51
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,870
Alright, so I believe we just got...

52
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,890
Yes, the next chapter page.

53
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,830
I hope Lilac hates us.

54
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,190
She's so base for that.

55
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,290
I think Lilac hates you the most, King Arthur.

56
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,390
Thank you for 5 months.

57
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,030
Thank you.

58
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,090
Alright, let's get into it guys.

59
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,990
Let's get into it.

60
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,230
Let's get into it.

61
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,190
A Legacy of Darkness.

62
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,470
1952.

63
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,450
Oh, hold on.

64
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,190
Let me move the...

65
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,350
I'll move this right there.

66
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,950
I don't think that's related.

67
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,930
I don't think that's related.

68
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,730
Maximilian.

69
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,630
It's like really depressing though.

70
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,030
Look at that.

71
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,450
We are pretty bizarre, yeah.

72
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,230
Secrets.

73
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,190
Oh my god.

74
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,630
We are grandpa.

75
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,490
Is this grandpa?

76
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:15,470
Are we going to figure out how to use that dang telescope?

77
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,370
Let's grab...what is that?

78
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,390
A journal of family history rests on the mantle as if used recently.

79
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,910
Take our historical journal.

80
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,130
That is thick.

81
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,470
Oh my god.

82
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,670
Liquid Courage!

83
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,390
A small flask of the old sauce.

84
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,130
Liquid Courage.

85
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:52,910
A magical elixir to power one's spirit in the face of adversity.

86
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,790
Bottoms up!

87
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,010
This regains our sanity.

88
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,370
This is saucy Liquid Courage.

89
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,930
Yeah, I guess Nintendo is just like, no, no.

90
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,790
No drinking.

91
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,550
No abuse of the bottle.

92
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,330
An old musty book bound by dry, dusty leather.

93
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,430
This book covers the early history of the Roivas family.

94
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,250
Dating back before the settlers in this land.

95
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,530
There appears to be something pressed between the pages.

96
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,130
Should Edward get it out?

97
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,470
Yes.

98
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,850
We have a minute hand of a clock!

99
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:38,850
What is that?

100
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,130
What was that doing in there?

101
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,950
Hold on, I want to talk to you.

102
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,750
Maid.

103
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,070
Maid, I wish to speak politely.

104
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,670
She asks Edward if there is anything she can do for him.

105
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,610
Yes, maid.

106
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:04,030
Sometimes it's so funny when I get, because of the way, you know, I'm Mint Phantom, but because of the way I put like maid mint and stuff on Twitter and YouTube and everything.

107
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:13,950
When I get like spam, like business emails being like, we want to work with you with this tool or whatever, they call me maid.

108
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,770
They're like, dear maid.

109
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:22,170
No Edward, you don't have a mythical family history.

110
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:25,190
It's called a family history of mental illness.

111
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:25,970
So true.

112
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,650
These books contain the history of the Roivus family, genealogy, birth and death records, deeds and writs.

113
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,650
What's a writ?

114
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,010
The Roivus history is a troubled one.

115
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,250
As Mediterranean immigrants, the early Roivus were shunned by other settlers in North America.

116
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:41,870
What?

117
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:43,730
Suspected of witchcraft?

118
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:49,990
The Roivus were convicted during the witch huts, forcing them into hiding.

119
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,110
As memories faded, the Roivus rebuilt their lives.

120
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,990
What's this way?

121
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,680
There's a storm ahoot.

122
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,940
A thick layer of grime on the window prevents Edward from looking out into the garden.

123
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,060
That's gross.

124
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,920
Clean your window, Edward.

125
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,660
Despite the efforts of the servants Edward hires, the mansion continues to sink into decay.

126
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,360
Oh my god, that lady scared me up there.

127
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,180
Maid Mintfantom.

128
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,640
Oh, we have the hand!

129
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,640
I thought your last name was Ch.

130
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,960
Yeah, Channel, yeah.

131
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,140
First name Maid.

132
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,540
Middle, Mintfantom.

133
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,440
Last name Channel.

134
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:40,120
A large carriage clock, sitting in the foyer table.

135
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,120
Beautifully crafted, but it appears to be stuck, with the hand set permanently to 3.33.

136
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,550
Oh, okay.

137
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,270
3?

138
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,410
Oh, I guess it would make sense.

139
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,950
How would it be 33 if it didn't have a minute hand?

140
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,230
Yeah, why not 4.44?

141
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,690
So true.

142
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,580
I'm Maid.

143
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,440
Portraits of the ancestral rooibos line the foyer walls.

144
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,780
Wait.

145
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,440
Portraits of the ancestral rooibos line the foyer walls.

146
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,920
Their faces reveal a dark, brooding edge.

147
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,820
There is something about each one that gives the viewer an unsettling feeling.

148
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,320
I'm feeling unsettled, I am the...

149
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,160
Oh my god.

150
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,200
Ma'am?

151
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,700
You're scaring me.

152
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:52,620
As Edward nears, the servant stops mumbling to herself and asks him if he thinks the weather will clear up before the solstice.

153
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,100
Edward finds the reference to the solstice rather odd and ponders its significance.

154
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,720
This may be the end of eternal darkness, but you will never escape from eternal dorkness!

155
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,410
So rude, Blake!

156
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,330
How could you?

157
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,670
Got some revolver ammunition.

158
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:16,830
Can I go in here?

159
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,230
With no one living in the house for a long time, it's no wonder the pantry is empty.

160
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,550
Edward lives out of the refrigerator, so to speak.

161
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,380
Oh gosh, another guy.

162
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,860
Scares me.

163
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,780
I wish to speak.

164
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,860
The servant notices Edward's presence and comments on the weather.

165
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Idle chit-chat.

166
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,660
Can I open the fridge?

167
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,640
Can I get a little midnight snack?

168
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,140
No?

169
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,680
Alright.

170
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,700
Let's go in here.

171
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,280
This room freaks me out.

172
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,060
Ever since we saw that guy hanging.

173
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,420
Edward has never learned the piano, but that has not stopped him from hammering away at the keys now and again.

174
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,640
It is very therapeutic.

175
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,960
Perhaps one day, he would learn it properly.

176
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,180
I don't think so, Edward.

177
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,700
I'll take that!

178
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,020
An antique cavalry saber.

179
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,020
Mounted on a display stand.

180
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,920
Gleams in the moonlight.

181
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,080
I'll take that.

182
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,100
Does this super color look like mint to you?

183
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,020
Clove?

184
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:28,800
Yeah!

185
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,700
It's a little...

186
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,780
It could be a little lighter.

187
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,780
It's pretty... It's almost mint.

188
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,700
It's like so close.

189
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,740
You look just like my hair, for real.

190
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,480
There's a permanently immiscible powerful gun in this level that requires a bit of forward planning.

191
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,480
Rett!

192
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,320
You're back!

193
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,900
Alright, let's get that powerful weapon, baby!

194
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,240
Looks too turquoise.

195
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,780
That's what I'm saying.

196
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,100
It could be like a little bit more...

197
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,380
You know, it's a little dark for mint.

198
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,260
Maybe.

199
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,960
Puttering around with the crockery, the servant informs Edward that the table has been set for him just as he likes it.

200
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,020
Time to eat, baby!

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,400
Wait, can I actually sit down?

202
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:21,900
No!

203
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,480
Let me eat!

204
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,180
The sigils.

205
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,640
I can't see anything.

206
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,400
It's too dark.

207
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,840
Turn on the lights, grandpa.

208
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,540
Let's see.

209
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,640
We have this clock, this minute hand.

210
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,340
It doesn't go to that clock.

211
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,620
Is this to the basement?

212
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,630
Oh my gosh, why didn't they keep these doors?

213
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,150
Cryosight!

214
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,730
Oh my gosh, thank you!

215
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:09,210
I'm colorblind so I'll take your word for it.

216
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,570
Thank you for the Akasawa, thank you!

217
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,690
Thank you so much.

218
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,710
Oh my gosh.

219
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,450
You're not colorblind, are you really?

220
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:22,470
Wait, why can't we hear the...Oh my gosh.

221
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,410
Why can't we hear the rain anymore?

222
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,770
It's my birthday!

223
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:33,570
Happy Superview!

224
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,010
Kuro, happy birthday!

225
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,670
Happy birthday to you!

226
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:41,170
Happy birthday to you!

227
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:43,550
Happy birthday, Kuro-Nassa!

228
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,250
Happy birthday to you!

229
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,320
An exorbitant and out of place stained glass window ends the hallway.

230
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,380
Whoever put it here had eclectic taste and confirms Edward's belief that the mansion is more folly than a real house.

231
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,100
How do we...

232
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,960
Ma'am, did you hear that?

233
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,480
Where'd you go?

234
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,040
Where did the maid go?

235
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:13,900
Oh, here.

236
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,720
Did you hear that?

237
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:15,900
Excuse me?

238
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,060
Did you hear that?

239
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,080
She informs Edward that she believes the weather will worsen.

240
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,160
That she hasn't heard it being this bad for many decades.

241
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,320
We have to find, maybe...

242
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,640
The book?

243
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,700
What a strange angle.

244
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,380
Oh my god, there's a lady.

245
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:44,100
Muttering to herself as she works, the servant comments on how the mansion is never really clean.

246
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:47,860
Whispering

247
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,800
Gosh, I felt that too.

248
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,880
More shotgun shells.

249
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,320
Oh wait, a shotgun?

250
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,460
Edward is reassured at the sight of the family gun cabinet.

251
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,100
Itself a priceless antique.

252
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,580
He would rather not have to smash the window to get inside.

253
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,460
But where did he leave the key?

254
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,080
You've been extra squeaky lately.

255
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,680
I know.

256
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,320
It's not good.

257
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,640
My voice is not doing so hot lately.

258
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,500
I don't know why.

259
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,460
The Journal of Family History rested on the bench.

260
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,460
We got a historical journal.

261
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,420
What's inside this one?

262
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,580
An old, messy book bound in dry, dusty leather.

263
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,400
This book covers the recent...

264
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,560
Wait, what was the other one then?

265
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,320
The old history and the recent history.

266
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,940
Recent history of the Roivas family.

267
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,940
Going back perhaps a hundred and fifty years.

268
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,900
There appears to be something pressed between the pages.

269
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,400
Yes!

270
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,560
We got an hour hand!

271
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:01,670
My hand, your hand, our hand.

272
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,750
Elephant gun.

273
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,050
Is that the gun you're talking about?

274
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,030
Wait, is that the weapon?

275
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,310
The elephant gun?

276
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,390
This isn't that.

277
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,830
This is the shotty, right?

278
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,430
That's not the elephant gun, is it?

279
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,310
It's a big gun?

280
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,180
That sounds intense.

281
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,540
Oh, okay, my bad.

282
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,760
I was trying to talk to this guy.

283
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,800
Courteously, the servant asks if Edward is in good health.

284
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,120
Aww, thank you.

285
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:37,960
I hope you too.

286
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,880
Okay, bye.

287
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,640
Alright, let's see.

288
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,020
If I were an elephant gun...

289
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,020
If I were an elephant gun...

290
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,060
More ammunition?

291
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,780
More ammunition.

292
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,660
I can't get into any of these.

293
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,340
Oh, it's this weird painting.

294
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,540
Brooding, melancholic paintings adorn the walls.

295
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,020
Strange choices of decoration for a bedroom.

296
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:22,040
Each one seethes with a virulence that could only have been wrought by an unsound mind.

297
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:28,670
So...

298
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,690
Have you seen my elephant gun?

299
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,680
No way virulent mention.

300
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,520
Courteously, the servant asks if Edward is in...

301
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,140
Oh, okay.

302
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,060
You are the exact same.

303
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,300
I can't even see it.

304
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:53,220
If you were an elephant gun, you'd be in the trunk.

305
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
My bathtub.

306
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,240
The master bathroom is woefully spartan and only barely contemporary.

307
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,180
This guy complains about everything.

308
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,360
Hi, hi virulent.

309
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,560
Have you tried PayPal?

310
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,160
Oh yes, I do use that, the syrup.

311
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,320
I do, I do.

312
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,180
I haven't had any today, but I've been drinking it in my tea.

313
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,260
Maybe I should just do it by the spoonful, usually that helps my throat heal faster than drinking it.

314
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,640
The master bathroom is woefully spartan and only barely contemporary.

315
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:36,580
It appears to satisfy the most practical of tastes, or perhaps someone who has their mind set on other things.

316
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,340
What does that mean?

317
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,460
What does that...

318
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,420
What does that mean?

319
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,730
It's made out of elephants?

320
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,070
Don't say that.

321
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,490
I mean what, we're in the 50s, right?

322
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,130
They didn't really care back then about...

323
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,570
Our elephant gun has to be in here.

324
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,390
He shot with the elephant gun.

325
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,190
Maybe.

326
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,070
Where haven't I been?

327
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,450
I haven't been to...

328
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,450
Okay, so we have these...

329
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,150
We have the minute hand, oh sorry.

330
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,690
We have the minute hand and the hour hand.

331
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,690
The hour hand.

332
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:26,590
Where is a clock?

333
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,610
Besides the one down here.

334
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:41,750
Oh my god, Bigfoot, Bigfoot servant, oh my gosh.

335
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,110
Can I use it now?

336
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:47,970
No.

337
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,750
That truly was like a Bigfoot pose.

338
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,670
Isn't the...

339
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,770
The really cool room, isn't it behind here?

340
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,450
Or am I not remembering correctly?

341
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,350
I thought there was another door.

342
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,870
I just needed to come here the whole time.

343
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,130
Oh my god!

344
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,720
The other, the cool Rooibos.

345
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,320
The cooler Rooibos.

346
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,760
Maximilian, yeah!

347
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,790
Yeah!

348
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,890
This guy looks like...

349
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,110
He looks just like me.

350
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,570
He is so awesome, he is still here.

351
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,550
Let's go back.

352
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,510
Oh, there is the clock.

353
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,210
Okay!

354
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:17,370
Okay!

355
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,110
Okay!

356
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,630
Wow, what a puzzle.

357
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,830
What's this?

358
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,570
Magic pool?

359
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,170
What is that?

360
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,310
Magic pool, eh?

361
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:43,350
Now how do we, okay.

362
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,070
Solve this puzzle.

363
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:47,290
How are we supposed to know what time to set it to?

364
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,230
It's not empty, there is plenty of stuff in here.

365
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,430
With an almost patriarchal air of it's own.

366
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,470
The ghost asked Edward to set the clock, but there are no hands on it.

367
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:07,470
Edward must find the clock hands so he can set it properly.

368
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:10,310
Way...

369
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,690
Way ahead of you.

370
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,770
Have you found the summon ghost spell yet?

371
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:21,430
The runes are Mado, Minto, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin, Bustin.

372
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:24,690
Alright.

373
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:24,930
Alright.

374
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,570
Detail.

375
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,490
Should Edward...I want to adjust the clock.

376
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,790
I want to do it.

377
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:33,730
Oh okay.

378
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,210
3...33?

379
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,310
About right there.

380
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,270
About...

381
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:50,770
Oh!

382
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,270
About right there.

383
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,690
Bustin, Bustin, Far Gone, Bustin, Far Gone, Bustin.

384
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,130
Secret room.

385
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,810
That was like close.

386
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:12,990
That was like 3.34.

387
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,590
He is so shook.

388
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:30,750
He is like...

389
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,570
Let's grab some weapons.

390
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,410
Let's grab this weapon.

391
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,650
The loaded revolver.

392
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,730
I'll take that.

393
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,190
Though I would like a torch.

394
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,690
Elephant gun ammunition.

395
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,450
How do I get the elephant gun?

396
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,370
Shotgun shells.

397
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,690
Shot...oh a revolver.

398
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,780
If I were a key...

399
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,300
I feel like I looked everywhere though that I could've...

400
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:12,660
For now is what I mean.

401
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,220
When game gives you this much ammo it only means good things.

402
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,960
I want a melee weapon.

403
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,140
Oh wait, I do have a melee weapon.

404
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,580
I'm an idiot.

405
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,360
I picked it up.

406
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,800
I picked up my melee weapon.

407
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,060
Practice.

408
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:35,860
Good practice.

409
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,360
Nice.

410
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,360
Alright.

411
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,220
I do want the elephant gun though, so if I get too far...

412
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,840
And I don't get it, let me know.

413
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,040
Minto, I was told that my Kamiyoshi goth mid-lilac would be streaming today.

414
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,680
Have you seen her?

415
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,020
Hope you are doing well.

416
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,920
You know, how goths can be...

417
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,840
You know, she was supposed to stream today and then she was like...

418
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,980
She was like...

419
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,400
This is actually kind of pointless.

420
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,840
And just left me to take care of it, so...

421
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,360
You know.

422
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,140
Alright, here we go.

423
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,740
A strange... It's funny getting the Tome of Darkness.

424
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,980
Sorry, the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

425
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,700
Not in the screaming room, you know.

426
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,100
A strange leather-bound tome sits closed amidst a pile of books and papers.

427
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,360
Should Edward pick up the tome?

428
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,640
Yes.

429
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,760
Tome of Eternal Darkness!

430
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,300
So many things...

431
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:36,620
Oh...

432
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,480
I think you'll figure it out.

433
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,480
If you're at risk of missing it, I'll drop a hint.

434
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,060
Thanks Red!

435
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,300
What does the pool spell do?

436
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,680
This dread scroll contains the secrets of an arcane magic.

437
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,340
It reads...

438
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,300
This magic transfers the innate magical energy of the environment to the self.

439
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,040
The limitless power of the ancients...

440
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,000
Sorry guys.

441
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,560
Oh my gosh, I don't know why I can't stop yawning.

442
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,500
The limitless power of the ancients will be at your disposal for the duration of the magic.

443
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:22,400
Once the magic has waned, you will be bereft of spiritual power until it naturally seeps back into your being.

444
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,180
So I...

445
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:30,540
Okay.

446
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,520
I bet all the people in the mansion are going to turn on me now, aren't they?

447
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,780
They're all going to start attacking me, aren't they?

448
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,240
No!

449
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,220
My maids!

450
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,800
My maids!

451
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,760
Alright, so we gotta find a key and we gotta find...

452
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,220
We gotta go behind that door.

453
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,580
We gotta go behind that door.

454
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,020
No!

455
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,520
My maid is getting...

456
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,460
The dog ran away!

457
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,560
What is that?

458
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,840
No!

459
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,220
God, she's hot!

460
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,600
I'm sorry...

461
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,580
Oh my gosh, she's punching me.

462
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Sorry maid.

463
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,340
Sorry maid.

464
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,780
Can I finish you or...

465
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,460
Wait, what just happened?

466
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
Oh ok, my bad.

467
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,340
Oh, she's gone now.

468
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,240
The dog ran away!

469
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,680
What did we get?

470
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,500
We got...

471
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,440
Half a key tumbles out from the vase that has been toppled and smashed.

472
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,520
It glints on the floor.

473
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:49,000
Bottom half of the basement key.

474
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,540
Do I have to break all the vases to get more keys?

475
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,340
I guess I have to kill every single maid.

476
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,300
That scared me.

477
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,700
I have to kill all the maids here.

478
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,620
There can only be one.

479
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,300
And that's me.

480
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,360
Ok, the music is like really freaky though.

481
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,800
He was green.

482
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,700
Wait, did I not...

483
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,220
Ok, enchant item.

484
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,940
I'm just gonna enchant.

485
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,700
He was green so we do red.

486
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,280
Does that make her green?

487
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,680
Yeah, we must eliminate the competition.

488
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,560
So true.

489
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,820
Maybe I'll just make it purple.

490
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,720
On my sword.

491
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,860
Ok, let's go.

492
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,200
Everybody possessed now?

493
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,500
Oh my god!

494
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,840
Do something!

495
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,700
Maybe I can do something.

496
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,740
Oh, where is he?

497
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,200
Where are you?

498
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,960
Master bedroom.

499
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,380
Ok.

500
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,960
Was it this one?

501
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,070
Hey, move!

502
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:42,690
Move or something!

503
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,110
I'll save you!

504
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,930
Oh, I saved him.

505
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,110
I think I saved him.

506
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,780
He is...

507
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,020
What is...

508
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,380
He is sucking more power.

509
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:03,960
Are you ok?

510
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,780
Shaken by his brush with death, the servant gives his thanks.

511
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,980
He warns that the creature might still be around.

512
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,700
An extra firepower would be handy.

513
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,280
Reminded by his own words...

514
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,840
He fishes a key from his pocket and gives it to Edward!

515
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,380
I forgot he got attacked first.

516
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,640
I need to save that guy for the key.

517
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,560
I got it!

518
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,380
I got it!

519
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:24,980
Yeah!

520
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,580
I don't even need your hint, but thank you.

521
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,340
Alrighty!

522
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,540
Extra firepower for real.

523
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,400
Let's go get it.

524
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,180
I thought I was gonna have to...

525
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,440
What?

526
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,020
Oh, I forgot when I use this, it growls.

527
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,060
I was like... The face is growling at me.

528
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,920
Serval, it's your birthday!

529
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,520
And Putin!

530
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,060
Happy birthday to you!

531
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,760
Happy birthday to you!

532
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,840
Happy birthday Serval Gwen!

533
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:09,040
Happy birthday to you!

534
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,860
Happy birthday!

535
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,240
I think I'm in this maid's way.

536
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,820
Is it this one?

537
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,560
Yes.

538
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,460
No guy here.

539
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,000
Excuse me.

540
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,240
Excuse me.

541
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,620
Oh, let's get the key out.

542
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:33,410
The gun cabinet is now unlocked.

543
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,970
Pick up the elephant.

544
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,560
This function allows the character to change the fire, but...

545
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,320
Wait, fire selector.

546
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,980
What does that mean?

547
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,700
Mode?

548
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,220
Oh, what?

549
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:53,780
Wow!

550
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:55,200
Interesting.

551
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,920
Interesting, OK.

552
00:34:59,280 --> 00:34:59,980
How many?

553
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,320
I only have 24 bullets.

554
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,580
We have so many shotgun shells.

555
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,940
Where do I get the shotgun at?

556
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,380
I can fire one or both barrels.

557
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,180
That's crazy!

558
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,200
OK.

559
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,000
Oh, excuse me.

560
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,360
Thank you.

561
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,960
Alright, we got what we needed.

562
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,160
My Oshie is packing, always.

563
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,620
Let's see.

564
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,080
I have this gun.

565
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,060
And I have half a key.

566
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,040
I guess let's just explore.

567
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,540
Save?

568
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,080
Oh my god, I just heard something.

569
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,340
I don't think I can save.

570
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:47,640
Let's...Damn it!

571
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,400
I don't think I can save here!

572
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,800
The monster is on a timer.

573
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:00,560
You can follow it, then kill it after he starts attacking a servant to get more ammunition.

574
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,880
You can reveal invisible.

575
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,900
You can track it.

576
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,140
No way.

577
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,100
What is that?

578
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,420
We know where he is!

579
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,880
OK.

580
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,560
Right here.

581
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,480
I can save you.

582
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,900
I can save you!

583
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:28,150
My sword is done, so let's just equip this thing and...

584
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,470
Oh my god!

585
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,830
I can't even...OK.

586
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:37,370
Oh my gosh.

587
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,180
That was some crazy recoil.

588
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,560
Oh my gosh.

589
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,540
Wait, but my health...

590
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,160
Wait a second, I can heal again.

591
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,600
That's right.

592
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,520
I have the book.

593
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:52,980
Are you OK?

594
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,920
Grateful for having their lives spared from the monster, the servant offers a token of thanks.

595
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,280
Elephant gun ammunition!

596
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,420
Thank you.

597
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,060
Thank you so much.

598
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,120
I'm gonna do a big spell.

599
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,280
He has low, low health.

600
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,320
Oh my goodness.

601
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,000
He has very low health.

602
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:32,680
OK, so cast...so he is...so...oh my gosh.

603
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,780
You guys, I ask this every time.

604
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,860
I'm so sorry.

605
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,780
I cannot remember which spells...

606
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,780
So if I am doing the reveal invisible...

607
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,000
Would it be green or would it be red?

608
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,400
I can't...Pokemon rules, but it's not always Pokemon rules.

609
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,580
Someone keeps leaving my AOL chat room.

610
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,580
I know, right?

611
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,380
Oh yeah, now I can save.

612
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:02,800
Thank you.

613
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:11,100
Oh, with that hideous creature running around and attacking servants it's probably not a good idea to save right now.

614
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,880
I have to kill it first.

615
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,500
I've watched this game four times and still can't remember.

616
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,080
There is like one thing...

617
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:28,100
that makes it so...there is like one spell that I do the same instead of opposite.

618
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,340
So that's why it always confuses me.

619
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,280
OK, um...Pokemon rules for all except shield.

620
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:36,780
Oh!

621
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,480
OK, cast...do I need it super powerful?

622
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,200
Do you think he is a really powerful guy?

623
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,680
Can I just do like a 5 point?

624
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,900
Maybe I should do a 7 point.

625
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,160
That's the exact time you would want to save as a player.

626
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,800
I know, right?

627
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,640
This is so mean.

628
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,140
It has to be 7 point.

629
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,720
OK, so red.

630
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:16,300
Alright, let's go find this ugly...Oh my god, she scared me.

631
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,940
You are not the ugly.

632
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,140
Hey, guy?

633
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
Where are you at, guy?

634
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,640
In here?

635
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,000
Where are you at?

636
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:30,980
Ugly?

637
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,740
Ugly?

638
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,660
Ugly.

639
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,880
Oh wait, there is nobody in here.

640
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,760
What does that mean?

641
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,400
Oh my god.

642
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:00,580
No!

643
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,440
Come here!

644
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,480
Oh god, I'm gonna switch to the gun again.

645
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,260
Actually, what if I equip this gun instead?

646
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,600
Oh my god.

647
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,020
Bro.

648
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,730
Oh, not the lady.

649
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:26,150
Not the lady.

650
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,930
Not the maids!

651
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,730
Not the maids!

652
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:39,980
Oh my god.

653
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,030
Stay away!

654
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,130
Where is it?

655
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,590
Oh my god!

656
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,690
I'm sorry, maid!

657
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,470
I'm sorry!

658
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:53,210
Oh my god.

659
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:53,890
Oh my god.

660
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:54,530
No, no, no, no, no.

661
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,130
I'm gonna die.

662
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,510
I'm gonna die.

663
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:55,910
I'm gonna die.

664
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:56,370
I'm gonna die.

665
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:02,890
Let's see...

666
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,410
Friendly fire.

667
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,750
I can't use heal magic because he is still chasing me.

668
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:17,290
I can't use heal magic because he is still chasing me.

669
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:19,410
You guys, I have to stand still.

670
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,170
He's gonna hit me.

671
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,130
That's how it works.

672
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,510
If you don't let him attack the servants first, they don't know they've been saved and won't give you spare ammo.

673
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,190
What?

674
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,890
Oh my god, this game is ridiculous, I swear.

675
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:30,870
I swear.

676
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:32,010
Ok, hold on.

677
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,630
Attack the maid!

678
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,970
I'm leaving.

679
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,910
Maybe I can heal in here.

680
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,450
Well, I don't think I need it so much.

681
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,610
And let's reload.

682
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:56,650
Nice.

683
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:01,550
Ok, and let's go back up.

684
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,110
Oh my god.

685
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,000
I'm also going to...

686
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,300
He's green.

687
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,320
What do I want to do?

688
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,740
I think I'm wasting bullets here, so let's do this.

689
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,580
He is camping!

690
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,240
Cool spell with purple rune is very helpful.

691
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,580
Awesome, thank you guys.

692
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,240
Ok, let's...

693
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,180
I guess we'll kill him or attack.

694
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,210
She looks scared though, right?

695
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:49,070
In its desperation to escape from Edward, the vampire creature drops the top half of a key onto the floor.

696
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:51,330
Oh, we got the top half!

697
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:52,350
Let's go.

698
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,950
And he's gonna...

699
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,930
...absorb some more goop.

700
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:02,350
I love that he actually comes from the basement door.

701
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,090
That's so funny.

702
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:03,850
Are you ok?

703
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,650
Wow, she really doesn't know that she got saved by me.

704
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,330
You suck.

705
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,790
Give me more ammunition, please.

706
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:18,930
And I...now...

707
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:20,610
Broke it.

708
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,810
Oh, we've assembled it.

709
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:23,670
Kind of.

710
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,550
She was literally cowering.

711
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,930
How do you not...

712
00:43:30,930 --> 00:43:32,470
Oh, I still can't save.

713
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:33,250
No way.

714
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:36,690
If I die, I'm gonna have to do all of this all over again.

715
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,050
It's cruel.

716
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,310
It's actually cruel.

717
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,830
You did shoot her.

718
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,350
Okay, just don't die.

719
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,330
Yeah, just don't die.

720
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:08,880
I don't think I've saved since, like, a while even.

721
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,380
So, let's see.

722
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,560
I have this.

723
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,400
It's broken.

724
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,460
Yeah, it does appear to be broken.

725
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,340
So now we...

726
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:33,440
Do we...

727
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,060
Do you remember how to repair objects?

728
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,280
Yeah...

729
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,720
Yeah, obviously.

730
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,300
That which is broken shall be fixed.

731
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,460
I have to enchant it.

732
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,340
Cast...

733
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,600
Which...I just don't know what power level.

734
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:08,900
I'll do purple.

735
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,520
Unheal.

736
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,240
It's just a key.

737
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:15,860
Yeah!

738
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
There we go.

739
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,760
And someone mentioned having my shield up.

740
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,140
You know what?

741
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,280
That is a really good idea.

742
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,700
Since my...

743
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,120
My health is so low.

744
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,740
So let's do...Okay, shield is the same, so I need green shield.

745
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,800
Okay, now we need my thing to go back up.

746
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,020
She's like, why are you glowing?

747
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,600
Alright, let's go to the basement, I guess.

748
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,920
Even though I wish I could save and this game is so rude and mean to me.

749
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,060
Oh boy, what do I hear?

750
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,620
Oh my god!

751
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:28,250
I don't know if I'm hitting it or not.

752
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,270
No way.

753
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,410
He's gonna do it in front of my face?

754
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:44,770
Oh my god, leave.

755
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:47,090
And shield.

756
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:51,570
Cast...do I even have enough for shield?

757
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:54,250
Cast...shield.

758
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:56,010
Yes!

759
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,150
Alright, round two!

760
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:06,410
Hello?

761
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:07,590
Hello?

762
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,610
Hello?

763
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:09,650
Hello?

764
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,620
Oh my goodness.

765
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,640
No!

766
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,160
Oh my god!

767
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,800
Stop this!

768
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,780
My...what is it called?

769
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,460
My enchantment disappeared, so...

770
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,220
But the shield is working.

771
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,980
Yeah, it's working alright.

772
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,380
No!

773
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,780
We gotta run around.

774
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,610
Cast regen magic.

775
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:19,950
Use my magic to cast to get more magic.

776
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:24,790
Please cast magic pool.

777
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:25,970
Okay.

778
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:29,890
Purple pool.

779
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,790
Do I do it now or do I do it when he's here?

780
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:39,450
Just in case.

781
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,670
Just in case he walks out the door, you know.

782
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:50,710
Do it now, it's a lasting spell.

783
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:50,950
Okay.

784
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:55,870
I couldn't really tell what it meant, you know, so...

785
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,390
Alright, time to magic pool.

786
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:58,190
Oh wait!

787
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:04,090
We need tear and red gormor.

788
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:10,750
Tear.

789
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,690
Red gormor.

790
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,020
And I'll make it like this as well.

791
00:49:29,740 --> 00:49:30,340
What was it?

792
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:35,670
Tear.

793
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,710
Red gormor.

794
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,060
Alright.

795
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,360
Cast purple.

796
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,470
I have...whatever that means.

797
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,610
I don't.

798
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:12,610
So, if I go back down...

799
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,570
Yeah, he's still here.

800
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,400
I'm leaving.

801
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,540
Now you'll regen.

802
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,760
What are you...

803
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,160
Oh, I do!

804
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,660
No way.

805
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:33,700
Oh my god.

806
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,260
I'm regening for real.

807
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:37,660
But I need...

808
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,660
I'm gonna enchant...

809
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,220
On my sword.

810
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:44,560
Actually...

811
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,380
Yeah, on my sword.

812
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:58,550
Okay, awesome.

813
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:00,750
And then...

814
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:03,090
Let me shield a little bit.

815
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:03,690
Gosh.

816
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,730
I don't trust his health against this thing.

817
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:11,650
Bangalore Park.

818
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,930
Sand Cell Park.

819
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:17,670
Alright, now I'm ready.

820
00:51:18,570 --> 00:51:19,450
Come here.

821
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,050
Where are you?

822
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,140
Don't you dare.

823
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,220
Don't you dare!

824
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,080
Go get his butt!

825
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
Don't...get him while he's eating!

826
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,340
Get him while he's eating!

827
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,060
Oh my god.

828
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,220
Oh my gosh.

829
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,840
Ouchie, ouchie.

830
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,300
Break free!

831
00:51:59,580 --> 00:51:59,940
Break free!

832
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,190
Do something with this so that he can stop using it.

833
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:21,370
The simple obelisk made from an alien stone sits atop a wall.

834
00:52:21,490 --> 00:52:25,010
A runic design is carved onto the side proclaiming its allegiance.

835
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:26,430
Okay.

836
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:28,970
Where are you?

837
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,430
Where are you?

838
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,330
Oh my gosh.

839
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,550
Wait.

840
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:40,970
I'm gonna die.

841
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:42,450
No, no, no, no, no.

842
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:44,430
Wait.

843
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:45,410
Please.

844
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:46,830
Please no!

845
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:50,030
Oh gosh.

846
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:50,970
I need to get out of here.

847
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:53,030
Please hurry.

848
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,070
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

849
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:56,090
Oh my gosh.

850
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,820
Destroy the stone.

851
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:03,560
I know.

852
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Maybe with the guy...

853
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,260
Oh my gosh.

854
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:09,900
I mean I'm still regenerating which is good.

855
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,200
It's just I wasn't regenerating fast enough.

856
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:15,660
Scary, scary, scary, scary.

857
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,000
Magic pool saves the day.

858
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,440
For real though, I would have died.

859
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,860
I would have died, died.

860
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:27,020
Alright.

861
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,500
So if I enchant...

862
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:32,480
You know what?

863
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,020
It's time for the big guns.

864
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,860
It's time for the big guns.

865
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:38,860
Actually, I don't want to waste it.

866
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:58,360
Let me through.

867
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,420
Let me through.

868
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:18,250
Wait!

869
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:18,950
I destroyed it!

870
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:21,110
Oh my gosh.

871
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:22,630
Please.

872
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:23,910
Ok.

873
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,590
I destroyed it.

874
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:25,110
I destroyed it.

875
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:25,610
I destroyed it.

876
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:26,150
I destroyed it.

877
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:27,410
So let's leave.

878
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,410
And now...Hold on.

879
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:29,710
Ok.

880
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,630
Now I'm gonna...

881
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,190
Sorry guys.

882
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:32,610
Ok.

883
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,690
Now, I feel like it's best with my thing.

884
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,690
I can get the most hits because I missed too much with the revolver.

885
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,490
Paragon, Minto, Paragon, Matara, Paragon.

886
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,670
I cast a spell to get some calorie mate.

887
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:08,070
Damn, this lasts...this pool lasts a long time.

888
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:09,630
Oh, just kidding.

889
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,030
What is the time?

890
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,170
Ok.

891
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,570
It was red.

892
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,460
I can't believe it.

893
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,360
I can't believe it disappeared literally in that moment.

894
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,660
This is so messed up.

895
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,320
Alright, cast shield and then I think we'll be ready.

896
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,620
Paragon, Sand, Paragon, Paragon, Paragon.

897
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,620
Oh my gosh.

898
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,680
Alright.

899
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,100
Here I go.

900
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,360
Get his ass.

901
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,640
Get his ass, Rivas.

902
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:14,320
I'm trying to get his head but...

903
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,520
What was that screaming?

904
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:30,690
Yeah!

905
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,010
Save the game!

906
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,390
Ok, I feel so much better now.

907
00:56:35,570 --> 00:56:37,570
I feel so much better now everybody.

908
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,070
A new spell.

909
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,390
Summon horror?

910
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:44,570
I hardly even know her.

911
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:01,250
What does this one do?

912
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:30,730
It's the big guy, yeah!

913
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,590
I think we get to summon him.

914
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:36,410
More...what's this?

915
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:36,850
What's this?

916
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:39,470
Oh the shotgun!

917
00:57:41,150 --> 00:57:42,550
We got a double shotgun.

918
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,450
Why is it so small?

919
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:50,270
Shotgun shells and some more ammunition.

920
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,910
Oh no.

921
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,910
Inside the well, a crumbling ladder leads down into the cloying darkness.

922
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,070
Should Edward venture down the ladder?

923
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,390
Not yet.

924
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:11,630
Wow, they are really stocking us up you guys.

925
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,990
Oh my god.

926
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:17,290
We have a lot of ammo now.

927
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:23,190
53, 84, 54.

928
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,340
It's not really...

929
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:33,720
I'm scared.

930
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,920
Yeah, that's not indicative of anything.

931
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:47,700
I don't think there is anything else to explore in this so...

932
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,700
I guess we must venture down the ladder.

933
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,360
Which we've seen before.

934
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,480
As...

935
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,020
As Rooibos.

936
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,740
Maximilian Rooibos.

937
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,140
Here we go.

938
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,180
Oh my gosh, it's the JPEG city.

939
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,400
Maximilian had not lied.

940
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:15,940
The city is miraculous.

941
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:19,000
It glows in the darkness like an incredible jewel.

942
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,400
But the thought of what lies inside, the guardians of Zealototh, make Edward shiver with fear.

943
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:28,640
Nine great towers dwarf the surrounding city.

944
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:34,180
Perhaps the towers serve as a focus, channeling great tides of energy into the city itself.

945
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,400
Flat city.

946
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,880
It's like artifacting and everything.

947
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,300
Okay, here we go.

948
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:44,820
With my sword.

949
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:44,880
With my sword.

950
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,580
He looks so confident going down the stairs.

951
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,180
That doesn't sound good.

952
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:58,540
Is it that dog again?

953
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,020
Oh, it's a big guy.

954
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,220
Two big guys.

955
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:06,620
They don't notice me, do they?

956
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,340
Oh, I think they do.

957
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:14,180
Maybe we can lure one big guy at a time.

958
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,200
Okay, so...

959
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:21,120
Maybe two.

960
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,220
Summon your own big guy.

961
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:25,220
Should I?

962
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:26,880
Can I?

963
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:27,940
Alright.

964
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,200
Big guy war!

965
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,160
Big guy war!

966
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:34,340
If I summon him...

967
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:37,980
I can't do purple.

968
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:41,200
A red guy.

969
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:45,940
Wait.

970
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:47,120
Yeah, a red guy.

971
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,800
That's so messed up!

972
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:57,040
This game!

973
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:57,660
Wait, I'm stuck.

974
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,320
Okay, there we go.

975
01:00:58,340 --> 01:00:58,640
Nevermind.

976
01:00:59,060 --> 01:00:59,520
What?

977
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:04,540
Why even give me the spell right before?

978
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:06,640
Why?

979
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,520
Why even give me the spell right before I come down here?

980
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:13,560
That's messed up!

981
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,740
Oh, I need more space.

982
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:18,840
Like here.

983
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:27,870
Oh my god, that was so close to hitting me.

984
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:30,210
Oh, here we go.

985
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:31,310
Here he comes.

986
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,330
It's my big guy versus your big guy.

987
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,510
After a horror has been summoned, press A to attack enemies.

988
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:39,890
Attacks can be targeted using R.

989
01:01:40,370 --> 01:01:44,070
So it's the same as aiming.

990
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:47,530
Attack an enemy's head from far away to perform a shock attack.

991
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:49,950
Press...

992
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,390
What is that?

993
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:52,190
Start?

994
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,810
To release control of the horror.

995
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:58,190
Horrors can open doors, but not... They can open doors?

996
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,110
Okay, here we go.

997
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:07,090
Ouchie ouch.

998
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:07,870
Wait.

999
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,630
Okay, turn around.

1000
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:17,810
Okay, my guy is kind of getting bodied right now and he also can't walk properly.

1001
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,830
Wait!

1002
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:22,850
I'm aiming and attacking, but it's not working.

1003
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:24,610
Wait, why can't he walk properly?

1004
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:27,710
What the...

1005
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:29,810
Why isn't it working?

1006
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,180
Oh my god, they're way bigger than me.

1007
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:41,420
They're way bigger than me.

1008
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,680
They're way bigger than me.

1009
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,530
Time to summon another guy.

1010
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,070
How much do I have?

1011
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:20,430
Time to drink up.

1012
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:22,910
Wait, no, this is for sanity, isn't it?

1013
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:26,090
That's for sanity.

1014
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,170
Staff member has died.

1015
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:38,610
No!

1016
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,790
Here's one to restore your streaming power.

1017
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:50,970
Oh my gosh, how many angles is that?

1018
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:54,930
Take the super chatter advice.

1019
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:55,710
Wait, what was that?

1020
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:04,170
Superior enchanted shot from both barrels of the elephant gun to the head should one shot any enemy in the game.

1021
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:05,730
It also pierces enemies.

1022
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,190
That's not useful.

1023
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:10,810
99% of the time.

1024
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:16,150
Okay, so let's enchant.

1025
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,470
You know what this game feels like?

1026
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:22,150
It feels almost like...

1027
01:04:23,050 --> 01:04:26,510
The way you have to do the spells and everything...

1028
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:32,450
The amount of time I've spent in the menu, it feels almost like a...

1029
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,410
Like a...

1030
01:04:36,310 --> 01:04:38,250
Like a turn based RPG.

1031
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:40,150
You know?

1032
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,250
Oh my god, I hate running down here.

1033
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:49,730
Okay, hold on, I gotta escape for a second.

1034
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:50,950
Shoot.

1035
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:53,750
Can I do it on the stairs?

1036
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,640
Yeah, probably.

1037
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,340
I can do the shortcuts.

1038
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:23,240
It's just, you know...

1039
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,160
Alright, let's go try.

1040
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:26,500
Oh, reload.

1041
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:34,380
Oh, how do I reload this?

1042
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,360
It doesn't let me.

1043
01:05:45,220 --> 01:05:46,020
Mix?

1044
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:49,880
Like that?

1045
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:50,900
What the hell?

1046
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,240
That's so strange.

1047
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,540
That's so weird.

1048
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:55,020
Okay.

1049
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,100
Oh my gosh, that was close.

1050
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:04,200
Get up!

1051
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,560
You gotta be fast!

1052
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,240
I can't tell...

1053
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:18,580
I think I got him.

1054
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,060
Take the shot.

1055
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:25,580
I got him!

1056
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,520
I'm gonna finish him with my sword.

1057
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,400
Finish him.

1058
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:31,080
Whack!

1059
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:31,960
Whack-a-doodle!

1060
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:32,460
Whack!

1061
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,000
Yippee!

1062
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:44,980
As Maximillian had mentioned, the ruins of the ancient city of Edengar were parasitized by the Guardians.

1063
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,220
They had slaughtered the original inhabitants and fed upon them, laying waste to their civilization.

1064
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,940
You need to hold aim for a few seconds to steady the elephant gun before firing, or it knocks you on your butt.

1065
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,280
Oh, that's why.

1066
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:06,860
The ghosts of glorious past lie forgotten, and the chitterings of the parasites echo amongst the remnants of their legacy.

1067
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:08,680
That's crazy.

1068
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:15,920
I'm scared to go anywhere.

1069
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:20,140
Not that way.

1070
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,520
We're so small.

1071
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:25,880
Okay.

1072
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,080
Anything over here?

1073
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:31,700
Nothing?

1074
01:07:31,980 --> 01:07:32,260
Okay.

1075
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,380
Let him breathe a little bit.

1076
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,180
I didn't know you could keep it from happening.

1077
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,300
How long do I have to keep it held, I wonder?

1078
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,520
I guess we just go inside.

1079
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,580
Oh, there it is.

1080
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:50,820
Okay.

1081
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:52,520
I'm scared.

1082
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:52,980
I'm scared.

1083
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:53,320
Wait.

1084
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,180
Before I do that...

1085
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:56,560
Yes.

1086
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,140
Yes, baby, yes.

1087
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:01,620
Yes, baby, yes.

1088
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,120
Let's...

1089
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,400
You need to let it hold for about long enough.

1090
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:30,460
Ain't that just the way.

1091
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,720
Should I do health or should I do all?

1092
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:39,240
Are these spells just what I gave for Elder Gods?

1093
01:08:39,380 --> 01:08:39,800
Yes.

1094
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,120
Purple is best for this spell.

1095
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:42,680
Okay.

1096
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,920
I know I probably should enchant something that I own currently at the moment, but...

1097
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:03,720
Oh, boy.

1098
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:05,460
Oh, no.

1099
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:06,620
Oh, boy.

1100
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,660
Oh, God.

1101
01:09:07,840 --> 01:09:08,860
Oh, no.

1102
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:11,980
Okay, equip.

1103
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,420
I think I got the shot.

1104
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:24,840
Oh, I need to reload.

1105
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,280
Oh, my God.

1106
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,160
They're really... Please reload.

1107
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:30,460
No.

1108
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,820
No, turn around, please.

1109
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:34,340
Oh, my gosh.

1110
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,240
The controls in this area are really hell.

1111
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:38,500
They're really hellish.

1112
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,460
They're really hellish in this area.

1113
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,320
Please, reload faster.

1114
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:44,440
Oh, my gosh.

1115
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:46,220
Oh, my God.

1116
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,120
They're... Oh, my God.

1117
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:47,740
They're really hell.

1118
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:48,460
They're really hell.

1119
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,120
They're really hell.

1120
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:52,720
Damn it.

1121
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:02,110
They're getting up on me.

1122
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:05,670
I'm gonna die here.

1123
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:08,430
I'm gonna die.

1124
01:10:13,450 --> 01:10:14,910
Oh, my gosh.

1125
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,260
Edward has perished at the hands of the eternal darkness.

1126
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:25,740
Okay.

1127
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:28,520
It's alright.

1128
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,280
We just saved.

1129
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,960
They did out park on me.

1130
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,080
I was trying to shoot, but maybe I do have to use my guy.

1131
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,640
Maybe I should summon...

1132
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,260
We shall summon a giant guy.

1133
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:44,340
This one.

1134
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:45,640
Yes.

1135
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,440
Okay, here we go.

1136
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:52,180
The green horror zap attack is what's scrambling your controls.

1137
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:52,740
Oh, really?

1138
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:52,940
Okay.

1139
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:56,660
So it's not just like a...

1140
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:59,440
A weird thing that's going on with the map.

1141
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,740
It's actually...

1142
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,740
If I send him in there...

1143
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:08,620
Pre...

1144
01:11:08,620 --> 01:11:11,420
What if I send my guy in there, like, before him?

1145
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:12,680
You know?

1146
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,540
What if I just let him go in?

1147
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:19,280
Alright.

1148
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:19,480
Alright.

1149
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,180
Maybe...

1150
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:24,340
Here.

1151
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,220
Here.

1152
01:11:42,980 --> 01:11:44,380
Alright.

1153
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:46,680
Off I go!

1154
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,260
Good luck guy!

1155
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:58,770
You got this!

1156
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:01,230
Good luck!

1157
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:02,530
Good luck!

1158
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,170
Oh my gosh.

1159
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:06,610
Oh my gosh.

1160
01:12:06,650 --> 01:12:07,450
Move, move, move, move.

1161
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:09,550
No, no, no.

1162
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:10,690
He's really scrambling my controls.

1163
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:13,950
Oh my gosh.

1164
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,910
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1165
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:16,490
Take him down.

1166
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:16,990
Take him down.

1167
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,090
Oh my gosh.

1168
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,960
What the hell is that?

1169
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:36,140
Oh.

1170
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:37,700
What is this?

1171
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:40,860
One guy down!

1172
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:41,800
One guy down!

1173
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,240
No!

1174
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:49,680
Ouchie.

1175
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:50,660
It's okay.

1176
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:51,480
Keep going.

1177
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:52,620
Keep going!

1178
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,420
Keep going!

1179
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,460
I don't know if I'm doing anything.

1180
01:12:59,540 --> 01:13:00,560
Keep going!

1181
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:02,820
Keep going!

1182
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,260
Oh he's summoning things.

1183
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:06,200
Ouchie, ouch.

1184
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:08,200
Ouchie, ouch.

1185
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,820
Come on!

1186
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:17,060
I think I'm hitting him.

1187
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:18,400
Wait, he's got a shield?

1188
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:19,060
Maybe.

1189
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,160
I can't tell if I'm doing anything.

1190
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,620
I'll be honest.

1191
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:33,960
Am I doing anything?

1192
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:35,960
He's got a barrier.

1193
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:44,200
Come on guy!

1194
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:51,550
I don't think he's getting through the shield.

1195
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:54,050
I don't think it's working.

1196
01:13:55,010 --> 01:13:56,570
Alright, we'll just let him die I guess.

1197
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,770
You're doing good!

1198
01:14:01,730 --> 01:14:02,370
Dispel.

1199
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:03,530
Can I do magic from here?

1200
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:17,540
Enemy barriers cannot be destroyed by combat.

1201
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:33,260
I think he's still alive in there.

1202
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:42,800
Save scumming.

1203
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,740
What if I send another guy in there?

1204
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:55,960
There he is!

1205
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,040
Oh no.

1206
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,880
Okay, we have to use the dispel.

1207
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,240
I know we have to use the dispel magic.

1208
01:15:21,080 --> 01:15:22,020
Are they fighting?

1209
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,880
Alright, maybe from like...

1210
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:26,760
Ouchie, ouch, ouch, ouch.

1211
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:29,760
Do you think he's going to notice me or...

1212
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,240
They'll fight for sure.

1213
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:34,900
Maybe from here it will work.

1214
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:36,240
Alright, here we go.

1215
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:39,560
Wait...

1216
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,940
Dispel is Pokemon rules?

1217
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,160
Pokemon rules, right?

1218
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:00,600
That didn't work.

1219
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,580
We have to time it when they're doing their...

1220
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,540
When they're doing their thing.

1221
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,000
Guys,

1222
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,290
am I going to beat this today?

1223
01:16:26,330 --> 01:16:28,090
Guys, am I going to beat this game today?

1224
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,090
I really want to.

1225
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,850
I want to start other series, you guys.

1226
01:16:32,710 --> 01:16:35,190
As much as I'm having fun with this game...

1227
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,190
It's been a long time since I've been playing it.

1228
01:16:42,980 --> 01:16:46,160
Alright, let's first enchant ourselves.

1229
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,760
Not enchant item.

1230
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,720
Give us a little bit of a shield, baby.

1231
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:54,440
Nevermind.

1232
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:57,720
Give us a little bit of a...

1233
01:16:57,720 --> 01:16:59,600
Let's go for a brisk jog.

1234
01:17:01,680 --> 01:17:03,140
Let's go for a brisk jog.

1235
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,180
Because we're going to need enough for the dispel.

1236
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:08,980
Am I going to have to kill both of them?

1237
01:17:11,380 --> 01:17:12,720
OK, so we need...

1238
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,060
I'm going to do the magic pool.

1239
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:17,560
I'm going to do...

1240
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,160
I'm going to do the shield.

1241
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,760
And then we just need enough for the dispel.

1242
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,700
And we'll be good, I think.

1243
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:28,300
You'll need a red shield to keep your health.

1244
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:29,740
I can't believe I accidentally...

1245
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:31,300
I tried to let him die.

1246
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:32,020
I really did.

1247
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,540
This is the last big difficulty bump, if I remember right.

1248
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:37,120
Oh, really?

1249
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,700
If not, it's OK.

1250
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:41,840
We can persevere.

1251
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:43,820
We'll persevere, everybody.

1252
01:17:50,940 --> 01:17:52,840
This level and the final level are quite long.

1253
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:55,320
There's one chapter in between that's not as long.

1254
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,820
OK, cool.

1255
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,020
Should we be good for the shield?

1256
01:17:59,440 --> 01:17:59,680
Oh, wait.

1257
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,160
OK, OK.

1258
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:02,800
We're good, good, good.

1259
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:05,820
Hopefully...

1260
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,320
We can...

1261
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,660
I'm going to do... Actually, I'm going to do my health.

1262
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:19,680
I'm going to do my health.

1263
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:23,820
Master.

1264
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:24,180
Master!

1265
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,380
It's a secret ending in the first chapter if you let Pius die.

1266
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:30,800
Really?

1267
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,540
Go to the options in the main menu and listen to music.

1268
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:38,100
I'm playing right now, but maybe I'll do it later.

1269
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:41,900
Let's see.

1270
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,260
And then, magic pool.

1271
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,220
And we'll do purple.

1272
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:53,840
I don't want my shield to go to waste.

1273
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:58,220
Wait, the shield doesn't disappear unless it gets...

1274
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,500
It lasts a while.

1275
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,460
OK, let's see.

1276
01:19:11,260 --> 01:19:11,780
OK.

1277
01:19:13,060 --> 01:19:13,700
Alright.

1278
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:16,560
Alright.

1279
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:18,840
Alright.

1280
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,880
Maybe now.

1281
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:24,420
Nice.

1282
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:24,740
OK.

1283
01:19:25,180 --> 01:19:27,240
Oh my god, just barely.

1284
01:19:31,220 --> 01:19:32,280
OK.

1285
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,300
I...

1286
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,300
I'm regening magic, but...

1287
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,140
OK, we gotta do the dispel.

1288
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,460
We gotta do the dispel.

1289
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,380
The dispel magic.

1290
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,140
So I need to run around just a little bit more.

1291
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:49,740
Just a tiny bit more.

1292
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:51,420
OK, OK, OK.

1293
01:19:52,780 --> 01:19:55,580
Just a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit.

1294
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,040
We gotta have enough.

1295
01:19:58,760 --> 01:19:59,840
We gotta have enough.

1296
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:03,580
So I can go in and run and do it.

1297
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,060
Sign into a hotkey.

1298
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:11,520
Yeah, I guess I could, but it doesn't waste time.

1299
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:13,600
Eh, magical attack.

1300
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:14,320
I have recover.

1301
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,240
Or Y.

1302
01:20:18,700 --> 01:20:20,840
Recover, recover, magical attack.

1303
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:22,700
Let's see.

1304
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,580
Let's do dispel.

1305
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,480
We'll do the dispel one at the top.

1306
01:20:30,850 --> 01:20:32,090
Dispel magic.

1307
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:33,210
Assign.

1308
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:35,930
It was a 5 point.

1309
01:20:36,730 --> 01:20:39,210
So I can do 5 point and then...

1310
01:20:39,790 --> 01:20:40,250
Oh, red.

1311
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:42,210
There we go.

1312
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:42,630
OK.

1313
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:46,790
Hokey, tokey.

1314
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:48,930
Ikky, my show.

1315
01:20:54,580 --> 01:20:56,520
I can't believe he's there.

1316
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,320
No, you are my guy.

1317
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,540
You are supposed to be on my side.

1318
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:04,200
Messed up, so messed up.

1319
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:06,880
OK, go in.

1320
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,760
OK, good, good, good.

1321
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,540
Alright, now...

1322
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:14,880
I think I was too late.

1323
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,180
It disappeared!

1324
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,680
It disappeared!

1325
01:21:21,780 --> 01:21:22,080
It disappeared!

1326
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:26,520
You think...

1327
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,360
I'm going to...

1328
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:31,900
Summon a guy.

1329
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,300
I'm gonna summon a guy.

1330
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:34,240
I'm gonna summon one.

1331
01:21:34,820 --> 01:21:35,840
I'm gonna summon a horror.

1332
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,960
And I'm gonna have him kick their butts.

1333
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,620
He's just standing there.

1334
01:21:50,220 --> 01:21:52,000
That's my guy!

1335
01:21:55,180 --> 01:21:56,140
Here we go.

1336
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:58,980
Oh, he's dead.

1337
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,160
Nice.

1338
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,560
We're acting like it's a...

1339
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,820
Kaiju battle.

1340
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,300
Kaiju battle.

1341
01:22:14,700 --> 01:22:16,320
Are you kidding me?

1342
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:19,460
Are you kidding me right now?

1343
01:22:20,020 --> 01:22:20,260
Wait.

1344
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:21,840
Wait, are you kidding?

1345
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:25,180
Are you kidding me right now?

1346
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:26,940
What's going on?

1347
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:37,450
Oh!

1348
01:22:37,710 --> 01:22:38,530
Oh my god!

1349
01:22:50,790 --> 01:22:54,250
So we are getting him now and he's getting scared of us.

1350
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:09,220
I think I am... It won't let me throw the Ultra Ball.

1351
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:15,220
It won't let me throw a long range attack and I'm not quite sure why.

1352
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:16,600
Oh my gosh.

1353
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,480
Where did he go?

1354
01:23:19,540 --> 01:23:20,240
What is happening?

1355
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:24,540
Oh, he's right here.

1356
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,050
Again?

1357
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:44,760
My guy is just standing there.

1358
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,080
Okay, it doesn't help that we are so slow.

1359
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,320
We are so slow.

1360
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,000
Oh my god!

1361
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:01,300
Stupid!

1362
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,800
Just stay here please.

1363
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,320
Where are you going?

1364
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:17,620
Stupid fairy!

1365
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:19,880
She was a fairy.

1366
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:23,460
Oh my god, please.

1367
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,580
My guy is literally just chilling.

1368
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:42,340
Oh

1369
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:46,430
my god, please.

1370
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:50,310
Okay, that gave up.

1371
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:51,310
Whatever that was.

1372
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:53,410
Why won't it die?

1373
01:24:53,530 --> 01:24:54,290
I don't know.

1374
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:58,530
I don't know.

1375
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,820
Oh my god, I thought I finally got it.

1376
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:23,870
He's gonna kill my guy.

1377
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,520
Am I doing this right?

1378
01:25:29,680 --> 01:25:31,620
I don't even feel like I'm doing this correctly.

1379
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,440
Okay, now we wait.

1380
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,420
Oh, nevermind.

1381
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:39,900
Just kidding.

1382
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,200
Where do you hide behind a shield?

1383
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,020
Oh my god.

1384
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:47,380
No!

1385
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,310
I am hitting him.

1386
01:26:03,190 --> 01:26:03,810
But...

1387
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:18,730
I'm definitely hitting him.

1388
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:29,980
No!

1389
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,440
Now we are faster I guess.

1390
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,620
Okay, hold on.

1391
01:26:55,180 --> 01:26:56,700
I don't know if I'll make this.

1392
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,340
I don't know if I'll make this.

1393
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,720
I don't know if I'll make this.

1394
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,760
Did it just put up its shield again?

1395
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:07,780
I think I just saw it put up its shield again.

1396
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,140
You little bitch.

1397
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:20,000
Maybe that's why I wasn't hitting it.

1398
01:27:36,670 --> 01:27:38,590
I can't stand this guy.

1399
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:40,310
So I was hitting him.

1400
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:45,330
I was doing the right thing.

1401
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:51,290
It's just... I don't know what's... I don't know.

1402
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:55,190
I actually don't know anything.

1403
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:00,100
I'm actually so confused.

1404
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,980
Oh yeah, I keep getting knocked on my butt.

1405
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:10,000
Reload.

1406
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:19,370
This thing is so stupid.

1407
01:28:21,290 --> 01:28:21,730
But...

1408
01:28:23,170 --> 01:28:24,770
I didn't get...

1409
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:26,130
Was that it?

1410
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:42,530
What

1411
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:47,180
are you talking about?

1412
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:47,600
No!

1413
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:51,080
So he just had a bajillion strength.

1414
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:52,260
Oh my gosh.

1415
01:28:52,420 --> 01:28:53,220
Or health I mean.

1416
01:28:54,020 --> 01:28:55,280
Yeah, we did it baby!

1417
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:58,700
Okay, all these things...

1418
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:02,480
I don't know if I dispel the magic and go through them.

1419
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:05,380
But let's just walk around for a bit.

1420
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:08,180
That was just a test of my patience.

1421
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:09,460
More than anything.

1422
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,560
Good job.

1423
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:16,620
Here we go.

1424
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:27,240
These plinths look like the ones Pius had encountered in the Forbidden City.

1425
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,800
Where he found the essence of the ancients.

1426
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:33,020
Edward briefly wonders what their purpose could be.

1427
01:29:35,060 --> 01:29:37,000
Are we going in that?

1428
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:38,660
Okay.

1429
01:29:44,060 --> 01:29:44,660
Oh.

1430
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:49,620
A pulsating field of energy emanates from the stone should Edward touch the field.

1431
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:51,420
Yes.

1432
01:29:59,070 --> 01:30:00,470
Oh my god.

1433
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:01,970
We are portaling somewhere?

1434
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:03,370
Where are we going?

1435
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:05,070
It's a stargate?

1436
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:05,930
Yeah, for real?

1437
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:10,660
What am I hearing?

1438
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,080
Oh no.

1439
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:14,680
These guys.

1440
01:30:14,680 --> 01:30:15,780
Oh, these guys.

1441
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,200
I think I killed him.

1442
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:23,600
Yeah.

1443
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,090
Wait, maybe I should have taken that.

1444
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,790
Wait, can I get out of here?

1445
01:30:38,450 --> 01:30:39,270
Oh, there we go.

1446
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,530
Okay.

1447
01:30:42,650 --> 01:30:43,750
What's going on?

1448
01:30:44,710 --> 01:30:45,570
What is this?

1449
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:49,650
Chill out!

1450
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:51,410
Your sanity is not even that low.

1451
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:57,190
These spires appear to be focusing magical energy from a nearby source.

1452
01:30:57,330 --> 01:31:00,830
Perhaps if a rune is marked on the spire, it will affect the flow of magic.

1453
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:04,690
Could the spires themselves serve as a circle of power?

1454
01:31:05,510 --> 01:31:06,450
So what's the rune?

1455
01:31:06,470 --> 01:31:07,310
I don't see it.

1456
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:20,010
Oh!

1457
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,320
Can I change it still?

1458
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,300
Oh, I can.

1459
01:31:31,740 --> 01:31:32,800
If I feel like it.

1460
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,800
If I feel like it, I can still change it.

1461
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,400
Oh, what?

1462
01:31:44,660 --> 01:31:45,060
Guys...

1463
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:46,740
What one did I pick at the beginning of the game?

1464
01:31:49,180 --> 01:31:50,500
What one did I pick at the beginning?

1465
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:51,360
Was it green?

1466
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,240
Did I pick sanity at the beginning?

1467
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:54,960
So I need red.

1468
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,960
If it's like a power thing that's going to overwrite like the...

1469
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:03,560
Yeah, yeah.

1470
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,080
Since all the things here are green...

1471
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,560
We want red.

1472
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:08,440
Okay, okay.

1473
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:10,500
I get it.

1474
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:11,300
I get it.

1475
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:13,340
I picked Bulbasauria.

1476
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:15,880
Oh no!

1477
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:18,860
Oh my gosh.

1478
01:32:20,840 --> 01:32:22,040
Time to summon a guy.

1479
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,520
I love summoning horrors beyond my imagination.

1480
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:32,060
I love summoning horrors beyond my imagination.

1481
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:32,720
Oh my god.

1482
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:33,280
Oh my god.

1483
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:34,060
His eyes light up.

1484
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:34,660
It's so scary.

1485
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:38,720
Yeah!

1486
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:40,080
Let's go!

1487
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:43,780
Oh my god, my enemy.

1488
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,860
Hey, go away.

1489
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:48,980
Go away.

1490
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:49,760
Seriously.

1491
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:50,880
Just leave.

1492
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:54,140
What the?

1493
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:55,540
Wait, what just happened?

1494
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,340
Wait, what just happened?

1495
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,040
What just happened?

1496
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:05,820
No way.

1497
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,000
Oh my god.

1498
01:33:08,140 --> 01:33:09,000
And he disappeared.

1499
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,540
Wait, I think I should die.

1500
01:33:10,980 --> 01:33:11,920
I think I should just die.

1501
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,040
I saved.

1502
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,440
I saved after I did that fight.

1503
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,140
My sanity got too low.

1504
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:18,880
Just kill me.

1505
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,260
Just kill me.

1506
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:19,660
Just kill me.

1507
01:33:20,420 --> 01:33:21,140
Just kill me.

1508
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,540
Just kill me.

1509
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:22,080
Just kill me.

1510
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:24,880
Because

1511
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,520
I'm not gonna fight both of these guys.

1512
01:33:34,420 --> 01:33:35,200
It's fine.

1513
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:35,660
It's fine.

1514
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,180
I saved.

1515
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:42,760
I can't believe he just... As soon as I summoned him, he was just like...

1516
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,080
I'm not controlled by you.

1517
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:48,380
Summon monsters reduce sanity.

1518
01:33:48,640 --> 01:33:49,660
If you run out, they disengage.

1519
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:54,020
So that's the downside of summoning the horrors.

1520
01:33:59,010 --> 01:34:00,390
Okay, I get it.

1521
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:01,210
I understand.

1522
01:34:01,550 --> 01:34:02,130
I got it.

1523
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,610
I got it.

1524
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:04,910
I got it.

1525
01:34:04,990 --> 01:34:05,510
I got it.

1526
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:08,950
I think the big guy did do a lot of damage though.

1527
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:12,250
But also, I don't know when he put up his shield.

1528
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:13,950
That's okay.

1529
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:17,410
We'll just... Alright.

1530
01:34:20,450 --> 01:34:22,510
We can just...

1531
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:26,030
Do this part again.

1532
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:26,970
It wasn't that bad.

1533
01:34:39,220 --> 01:34:39,860
Yes.

1534
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:44,260
Alright.

1535
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,000
I'll save before I go into the next room though.

1536
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,980
Let's grab that.

1537
01:34:58,960 --> 01:34:59,840
And reload.

1538
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,940
Six shots.

1539
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,080
Morning Mito!

1540
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:03,700
Good morning!

1541
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:06,120
Alright.

1542
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,420
I look like a zombie here.

1543
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,180
Spooks me.

1544
01:35:12,180 --> 01:35:13,760
Freaks me out a little bit.

1545
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:14,360
Alright.

1546
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:17,120
Let's subscribe.

1547
01:35:18,520 --> 01:35:20,000
Like and subscribe.

1548
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:25,900
Now before we go in...

1549
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:28,180
Mix...

1550
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:29,000
Wait.

1551
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:29,420
What do you mean?

1552
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,340
What do you mean I can't mix?

1553
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,000
What do you mean I can't mix with the...

1554
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,700
Edward cannot load a weapon that is not equipped.

1555
01:35:39,020 --> 01:35:39,280
Oh.

1556
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:39,600
Oh.

1557
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,840
I need to learn how to read.

1558
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:41,760
That's what I need to do.

1559
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:43,740
Mix.

1560
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:47,440
Mix.

1561
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,400
Alright.

1562
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:51,560
Let's enchant it.

1563
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,800
It must have taken a ton of sanity then.

1564
01:36:06,420 --> 01:36:06,860
Because...

1565
01:36:06,860 --> 01:36:11,560
I mean my sanity is low, but it's not like crazy, crazy low.

1566
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:13,520
And let's magic pool.

1567
01:36:14,340 --> 01:36:15,760
And let's go in with my fists baby.

1568
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:17,820
Let's go in with my fists.

1569
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:19,820
I almost forgot to like.

1570
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:20,720
Thanks for reminding me.

1571
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:22,900
Thanks for liking it.

1572
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,020
Appreciate it.

1573
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:26,360
Make sure to join Chiturgu's membership.

1574
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:27,940
Oh!

1575
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,820
I forgot to save!

1576
01:36:30,860 --> 01:36:31,740
Guys, I'm an idiot.

1577
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:32,960
I'm so sorry.

1578
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:35,300
I'm so sorry.

1579
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,440
Can you go a little faster, you know?

1580
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:46,440
Nice.

1581
01:36:46,980 --> 01:36:47,580
Reload.

1582
01:36:47,740 --> 01:36:50,560
Oh my god.

1583
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,520
Just two hits?

1584
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,600
Wait, for this guy even two?

1585
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:55,740
That's insane.

1586
01:36:57,660 --> 01:36:58,340
Nevermind.

1587
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:00,700
Holy shoot.

1588
01:37:01,740 --> 01:37:02,280
Yeah!

1589
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:03,040
Take him down!

1590
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:03,740
Take him down!

1591
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:06,580
Oh my god.

1592
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,580
Now I can save.

1593
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,200
I'm understanding the power.

1594
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,020
Summoning was doing nothing in your favor.

1595
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:16,640
Okay!

1596
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:18,260
Well, at least I try.

1597
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:19,460
At least I experiment.

1598
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:23,920
Let me experiment in the game.

1599
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,100
Let me try things.

1600
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:34,480
I like feeling safe inside my magic scribe bubble...

1601
01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:36,740
and then letting other creatures do the work for me.

1602
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:38,220
Is that so bad?

1603
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:40,620
Is that so bad?

1604
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:42,900
A lever?

1605
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:43,920
Oh my gosh.

1606
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:47,280
Pull the lever, Edward.

1607
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:53,100
Okay.

1608
01:37:54,740 --> 01:37:55,940
I guess it worked.

1609
01:37:58,360 --> 01:37:59,440
I guess we are good.

1610
01:37:59,980 --> 01:38:01,160
Wait, which one opened?

1611
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:04,440
The one in the very back?

1612
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:06,160
The one I was looking at before?

1613
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:13,050
Have this at the ready?

1614
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,530
Oh, we have to keep going back?

1615
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,850
I understand.

1616
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:22,030
Just in case.

1617
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:23,110
I understand.

1618
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:27,990
So we are going to go to each little pillar and we are going to make it red...

1619
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:29,910
and then my thing is lagging.

1620
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:35,370
My sim... what are those called?

1621
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:36,850
The things above the sims.

1622
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:39,070
It's lagging.

1623
01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:41,130
I'm running too fast.

1624
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:42,610
Edward is a speed demon.

1625
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:44,250
Okay, so now we go to this one.

1626
01:38:46,990 --> 01:38:48,870
So they are all going to be red?

1627
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:51,230
A plumbob.

1628
01:38:55,030 --> 01:38:55,950
Is there anything here?

1629
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:57,710
Nothing?

1630
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,040
Paragon!

1631
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:15,400
Come on.

1632
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:17,520
Why can't you stay enchanted for longer?

1633
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:28,010
Just in case.

1634
01:39:32,610 --> 01:39:33,990
Nothing beats a good old paragon.

1635
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:36,970
We are paragoning in the city, you guys.

1636
01:39:37,050 --> 01:39:38,510
I never would have thunk...

1637
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:40,770
I never would have thunk we would paragon here.

1638
01:39:40,770 --> 01:39:42,790
So exciting.

1639
01:39:44,450 --> 01:39:47,990
Sorry, I don't mean to save scum, but I'm nervous.

1640
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:12,080
What is that?

1641
01:40:13,420 --> 01:40:14,060
Matara!

1642
01:40:17,660 --> 01:40:19,520
Alright, let's pull the lever.

1643
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:23,040
Wait a second, I see some runes.

1644
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,160
What's in here?

1645
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:27,340
Nothing?

1646
01:40:29,420 --> 01:40:30,840
Hack on the wall.

1647
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:33,660
Get your very own Matara statue.

1648
01:40:38,540 --> 01:40:39,820
Oh no.

1649
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:42,880
Wait, what's happening?

1650
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:43,500
Matara?

1651
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:47,520
Oh my god.

1652
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,200
The worms.

1653
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:55,520
The worms are inside us.

1654
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:56,600
The worms are taking over.

1655
01:40:57,680 --> 01:41:01,020
This looks suspicious right there, right?

1656
01:41:03,460 --> 01:41:04,440
Wait a second.

1657
01:41:04,740 --> 01:41:05,920
Did that use one of my drinks?

1658
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:09,080
Seven.

1659
01:41:10,460 --> 01:41:12,480
Did that use some of my liquid courage?

1660
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,160
Can you imagine if it did?

1661
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,100
That would be so messed up.

1662
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,060
He was so fast too.

1663
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:27,060
He was so fast with it.

1664
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:30,040
He was like, I know what to do.

1665
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:35,560
Wait, what?

1666
01:41:36,820 --> 01:41:37,500
Oh, just kidding.

1667
01:41:37,820 --> 01:41:38,820
I'm running into the thing.

1668
01:41:39,980 --> 01:41:40,720
Excuse me.

1669
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:41,920
There we go.

1670
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,620
Let's go with this one.

1671
01:41:47,800 --> 01:41:50,900
Have you guys seen that guy that's like... I don't know.

1672
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:51,700
He's like some streamer.

1673
01:41:52,580 --> 01:41:55,620
But he's like so good at...

1674
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:58,900
I should probably... My thing is enchanted.

1675
01:41:59,340 --> 01:42:03,020
He's so good at exiting a game when there's a jump scare or something.

1676
01:42:03,620 --> 01:42:05,780
He just literally will be like...

1677
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:07,480
And he's out of the game.

1678
01:42:07,660 --> 01:42:08,420
Like he'll just quit.

1679
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:13,720
I saw him like... I saw the clip compilation of him on Twitter.

1680
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:18,840
It was just like he's playing Resident Evil 7 and something happens.

1681
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:20,500
And you barely even see the jump scare.

1682
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:21,860
He's just already out of the game.

1683
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:22,820
It's so funny.

1684
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,300
Yeah, he's some flesh tuber.

1685
01:42:26,440 --> 01:42:27,820
I don't know who he is though.

1686
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,920
I like that these guys are one hit though.

1687
01:42:36,220 --> 01:42:37,680
Why am I so small?

1688
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:40,280
Do you think I'll hit it?

1689
01:42:41,180 --> 01:42:41,580
Nice.

1690
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:46,180
There's one more.

1691
01:42:52,620 --> 01:42:53,440
Alright, reload.

1692
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:54,800
Reload.

1693
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:56,540
Re-load.

1694
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:57,640
Reload the gun.

1695
01:42:59,560 --> 01:43:00,060
Reload...

1696
01:43:02,240 --> 01:43:04,400
I keep forgetting I have my shotgun too.

1697
01:43:05,540 --> 01:43:06,860
Built to Minto scale.

1698
01:43:08,740 --> 01:43:10,380
It's not even an Alt 4 macro.

1699
01:43:10,580 --> 01:43:11,900
He's really pressing every key to leave.

1700
01:43:11,960 --> 01:43:13,740
Yeah, like it's crazy, right?

1701
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:15,460
It's so funny to watch.

1702
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:17,620
There we go.

1703
01:43:21,260 --> 01:43:21,640
OK.

1704
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:23,340
Pull the lever.

1705
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,460
Are we going to get wormed again?

1706
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:29,060
Oh, a worm is going to come out of that ceiling.

1707
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:34,020
Run away!

1708
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:36,080
Don't get wormed.

1709
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,080
Alright, we're good.

1710
01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,300
Oh, I have to go a long way.

1711
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:41,780
Just kidding.

1712
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:43,180
Beat tuber.

1713
01:43:43,440 --> 01:43:44,180
Reload now.

1714
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:44,780
I did.

1715
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:45,800
Are you proud of me?

1716
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:47,840
Strike Warlock, are you proud of me?

1717
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,220
All I need is your validation.

1718
01:44:01,480 --> 01:44:02,560
Good work, Beat tuber.

1719
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:03,740
Thank you.

1720
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:06,880
Wait, this one is so cool.

1721
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:09,080
It looks like there is an eye staring down...

1722
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:10,560
and like the little tentacles and stuff.

1723
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,700
It's so cool!

1724
01:44:14,900 --> 01:44:15,720
Beat tuber, why?

1725
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:17,940
Wait, where are we?

1726
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,180
Oh, OK.

1727
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:21,960
We got to go up.

1728
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:23,400
Wait.

1729
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:27,280
Where are we?

1730
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:41,680
This way.

1731
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,620
Are you OK, man?

1732
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:47,720
He's so tired.

1733
01:44:50,680 --> 01:44:52,120
OK, interesting.

1734
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:53,040
Alright.

1735
01:44:56,120 --> 01:44:57,860
Let's keep going.

1736
01:44:57,860 --> 01:44:59,640
It's just pulling a bunch of levers.

1737
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,000
That's easy peasy, right?

1738
01:45:01,540 --> 01:45:03,200
Would you still love me if I was an eldritch worm?

1739
01:45:03,860 --> 01:45:04,920
Yeah, I think so.

1740
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:07,660
Now would you love me if I was an eldritch worm?

1741
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,460
You'd probably be like, oh yeah, baby.

1742
01:45:11,720 --> 01:45:13,360
Do you guys love anything new and different?

1743
01:45:14,020 --> 01:45:15,840
If I'm purple, you love me more.

1744
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:21,980
You guys are too used to me now.

1745
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:24,180
You're just like...

1746
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:26,820
She's old and boring.

1747
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:28,300
I need an eldritch worm now.

1748
01:45:29,740 --> 01:45:30,980
I need her to be purple.

1749
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:34,120
I need her to be purple now.

1750
01:45:34,780 --> 01:45:35,880
Or else I'm not interested.

1751
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:42,800
It's OK, I'll be new in like a couple days.

1752
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:45,180
And by a couple I mean like...

1753
01:45:46,860 --> 01:45:49,260
By a couple more like...

1754
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:49,920
20 days.

1755
01:45:50,220 --> 01:45:51,780
22 days.

1756
01:45:52,300 --> 01:45:52,620
23?

1757
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:54,460
Days?

1758
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,180
Days.

1759
01:45:57,300 --> 01:45:57,660
Pargon!

1760
01:45:59,440 --> 01:45:59,880
Pargon!

1761
01:45:59,980 --> 01:46:00,380
There we go.

1762
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:02,540
Alright.

1763
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,900
We keep on pargoning.

1764
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:06,820
Old and boring?

1765
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:08,100
Mintz, you are not boring.

1766
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:08,680
Are you sure?

1767
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:11,960
Wait a second.

1768
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,440
You forgot a part of that sentence though.

1769
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:23,210
The spam is going to be real confused if you changed your last name to Lilac.

1770
01:46:23,210 --> 01:46:24,030
Made!

1771
01:46:25,890 --> 01:46:26,730
Lilac made!

1772
01:46:28,410 --> 01:46:29,870
Glory be to Mintorok.

1773
01:46:33,030 --> 01:46:34,330
Did I save?

1774
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:38,130
Whatever.

1775
01:46:38,650 --> 01:46:38,910
It's OK.

1776
01:46:38,970 --> 01:46:40,850
I've been saving so much this whole time.

1777
01:46:41,410 --> 01:46:44,710
I've been saving so much this whole time I'm like not even concerned.

1778
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:47,510
If I die I won't even go back that far.

1779
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:49,350
That far.

1780
01:46:50,470 --> 01:46:51,830
Oh, just kidding.

1781
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:52,790
Alright, here we go.

1782
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,690
I must also...

1783
01:46:56,370 --> 01:46:58,110
I must also enchant.

1784
01:46:59,130 --> 01:47:00,690
Let's do our gun.

1785
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:08,040
Pargon!

1786
01:47:08,260 --> 01:47:08,680
Pargon!

1787
01:47:08,760 --> 01:47:09,140
Pargon!

1788
01:47:09,260 --> 01:47:09,520
Pargon!

1789
01:47:09,660 --> 01:47:10,220
Pargon!

1790
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:15,220
And since I have a lot of magic I will...

1791
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,600
Just go back to the magic pool.

1792
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,540
I like how this one is whispery.

1793
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:30,200
That was so close you guys.

1794
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:31,440
Where is he?

1795
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:45,870
Wait, does he have a shield up?

1796
01:47:48,710 --> 01:47:49,730
Does he have a shield up?

1797
01:47:49,930 --> 01:47:50,730
Oh, yes he does.

1798
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:54,130
I didn't even get to reload.

1799
01:47:58,530 --> 01:47:59,570
Dispel magic!

1800
01:48:01,630 --> 01:48:02,150
Red.

1801
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,810
Thank you for the red!

1802
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:10,010
I can't see who's name it is.

1803
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:12,590
But, thank you so much!

1804
01:48:15,310 --> 01:48:17,590
I'm reloading very slowly, but surely.

1805
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:24,250
Nice.

1806
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:24,770
Reloading.

1807
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:30,930
Where did he go?

1808
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:34,310
Pargon.

1809
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:38,150
I think we got him.

1810
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:39,470
Very good.

1811
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:41,710
Alright, good job everybody.

1812
01:48:41,770 --> 01:48:42,130
Good job.

1813
01:48:44,050 --> 01:48:45,010
I love...

1814
01:48:45,650 --> 01:48:48,090
I love the thingy!

1815
01:48:48,730 --> 01:48:49,310
Thanks for the gifted!

1816
01:48:50,110 --> 01:48:50,950
Sorry guys.

1817
01:48:51,910 --> 01:48:53,410
Sorry, I was in mid-battle.

1818
01:48:53,770 --> 01:48:54,790
Thank you for the red!

1819
01:48:54,930 --> 01:48:55,650
Thank you so much!

1820
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:56,730
Oh my gosh!

1821
01:48:57,610 --> 01:48:58,650
Murphy, thanks for the 5 gifted!

1822
01:48:58,910 --> 01:49:00,030
Raymac, thank you for the 5 gifted!

1823
01:49:00,030 --> 01:49:00,890
Hello everybody!

1824
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:01,150
Welcome!

1825
01:49:01,850 --> 01:49:03,230
My name is Mint Phantom.

1826
01:49:03,690 --> 01:49:04,750
I'm a Ghoulish-made Vtuber.

1827
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:08,570
I'm playing... I'm actually on the last part of this game called Eternal Darkness.

1828
01:49:08,690 --> 01:49:11,510
It's an old, old game from Gamecube.

1829
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:13,350
Casey, thanks for the gifted!

1830
01:49:14,210 --> 01:49:15,530
Ducky, did I say thank you for the gifted?

1831
01:49:15,630 --> 01:49:16,230
Thank you so much!

1832
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:19,710
And it's a lot of...

1833
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:22,270
It's a lot of...

1834
01:49:23,150 --> 01:49:26,430
Pargon and spells and crazy stuff.

1835
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:29,110
And watch, I'm gonna kill some guy.

1836
01:49:30,730 --> 01:49:31,630
Wait, where is he?

1837
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:34,870
Okay, I know he killed one guy because he like literally zapped him.

1838
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:36,810
Did he kill both of them?

1839
01:49:38,210 --> 01:49:41,110
I think... I don't have to do literally any work.

1840
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:42,210
Yippee!

1841
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:45,090
Driver says thank you for the gifted!

1842
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:46,430
Nochan, thank you for the gifted!

1843
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:50,090
That's so much Pargon.

1844
01:49:50,570 --> 01:49:51,910
There's our... There's our lever.

1845
01:49:52,970 --> 01:49:55,090
Can you imagine if there was just bullets down here?

1846
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,290
The game wouldn't be so kind though, would it?

1847
01:49:58,550 --> 01:49:59,870
Surely it's not that old.

1848
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:01,390
When did this game come out anyway?

1849
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:09,610
Pull the lever.

1850
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:13,810
2002.

1851
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:16,270
Guys, I think that's old.

1852
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:20,290
I think someone born in 2002 can now drink.

1853
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:24,430
Mickey, thanks for the gifted!

1854
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:26,450
Frozen frog, welcome to Mambo Ship.

1855
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:26,830
Thank you.

1856
01:50:26,890 --> 01:50:28,270
Is this the door that just unlocked?

1857
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:29,250
I think so.

1858
01:50:35,090 --> 01:50:36,330
Oh my god, spooky.

1859
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:37,750
Spooky eye.

1860
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:40,590
Alright, so we went through that one.

1861
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:44,630
Okay, slowly but surely we're getting all these done, baby!

1862
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:48,130
Let's go back to our room.

1863
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:50,810
So right now we're pulling levers.

1864
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,170
Okay, so see how everything is green?

1865
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:55,690
The opposite of green.

1866
01:50:55,690 --> 01:50:57,910
Wait, not opposite.

1867
01:50:59,310 --> 01:51:00,890
Green's nemesis is red.

1868
01:51:02,210 --> 01:51:03,030
Just like Pokemon.

1869
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:06,150
So we are setting the city on fire.

1870
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,590
Kind of, actually.

1871
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:11,810
We're actually kind of...

1872
01:51:11,810 --> 01:51:13,770
Yeah, we are setting the city on fire, aren't we?

1873
01:51:20,350 --> 01:51:23,970
Why is it not a perfect star though?

1874
01:51:26,330 --> 01:51:30,430
So we have one, two, three left?

1875
01:51:32,230 --> 01:51:32,710
Three.

1876
01:51:33,150 --> 01:51:33,710
Oh, four.

1877
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:35,010
My bad.

1878
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:35,630
Four left.

1879
01:51:35,690 --> 01:51:36,950
Let's get these two over here.

1880
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:40,950
Nice.

1881
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:43,330
Yeah, because everything is evil.

1882
01:51:43,470 --> 01:51:44,650
It's been taken over by...

1883
01:51:44,650 --> 01:51:46,770
Oh, we have to stop the eternal darkness.

1884
01:51:48,330 --> 01:51:48,810
Oh my gosh.

1885
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:51,350
Oh, that spooked me.

1886
01:51:51,350 --> 01:51:57,480
Get out of my way!

1887
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:00,880
That's right.

1888
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:05,520
Okay.

1889
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:07,080
Examine.

1890
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:09,580
Wait.

1891
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:19,320
This sure seems like a Paragon civilization.

1892
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:21,280
Oh no.

1893
01:52:22,240 --> 01:52:24,260
We've just been given Paragons.

1894
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:37,380
And I don't even have this rune because I missed it.

1895
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:39,400
I don't know what it does.

1896
01:52:42,420 --> 01:52:43,500
Let's finish this.

1897
01:52:44,460 --> 01:52:46,780
Us 02 babies are 22, Minto.

1898
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:49,200
I'm a month older than this game.

1899
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:50,580
Little baby.

1900
01:52:56,620 --> 01:52:57,020
Think.

1901
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,360
What do you want to do to the city?

1902
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,240
Also, I'm off to work now.

1903
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:00,060
No!

1904
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,220
Good luck with work.

1905
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:06,640
We want to...

1906
01:53:06,640 --> 01:53:08,600
Do we want to absorb the city?

1907
01:53:09,100 --> 01:53:10,240
We want to protect the city?

1908
01:53:11,140 --> 01:53:13,520
But we are trying to get the things out of the city, right?

1909
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:14,480
So like...

1910
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:21,280
Thank you.

1911
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:24,520
All things begin with Paragon and also ends with Paragon.

1912
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:25,660
You are no different, Mint.

1913
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:26,380
Wait.

1914
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:28,360
You are no different, Mint.

1915
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,420
In the end, all things must return to Paragon.

1916
01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:39,520
Wait.

1917
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:40,180
Hold on.

1918
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:40,760
Let's see.

1919
01:53:42,540 --> 01:53:43,460
Spell list.

1920
01:53:45,540 --> 01:53:48,600
We are trying to get rid of the guys out of here.

1921
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,300
Right?

1922
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:52,780
So...

1923
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:54,260
Nethlick and Redgore more.

1924
01:53:58,090 --> 01:54:01,510
It must be the one that is the question mark then, right?

1925
01:54:01,630 --> 01:54:01,870
Maybe.

1926
01:54:03,170 --> 01:54:04,090
Oh, off work.

1927
01:54:04,170 --> 01:54:05,130
Not off to work.

1928
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,350
You scared me.

1929
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:14,470
Oh my gosh, you scared me.

1930
01:54:14,530 --> 01:54:16,730
We are trying to dispel the green guys from the city.

1931
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:22,690
So, Nethlick is going to be the literal only one that we don't know.

1932
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:26,970
Right?

1933
01:54:28,130 --> 01:54:28,610
Yeah.

1934
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:30,210
So this one.

1935
01:54:32,110 --> 01:54:33,710
Question mark, question mark.

1936
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:35,490
You.

1937
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:37,230
OK.

1938
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:49,290
Sometimes I read fast because I'm like I gotta get back into the game.

1939
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:52,530
I gotta get...I'm gaving you guys.

1940
01:54:52,570 --> 01:54:53,690
I gotta get back into the game.

1941
01:55:00,690 --> 01:55:01,730
God dang it.

1942
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:03,410
Oh, I didn't even...

1943
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,190
Guys, I didn't even reload.

1944
01:55:05,410 --> 01:55:06,550
I like just...

1945
01:55:06,550 --> 01:55:08,890
Oh my gosh, and there is little thingies here.

1946
01:55:10,910 --> 01:55:14,910
Spell list, enchant cast...

1947
01:55:14,910 --> 01:55:15,570
On you.

1948
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,140
OK, and now...

1949
01:55:40,280 --> 01:55:41,440
I gotta get rid of these.

1950
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:43,020
Oh gosh, I can't even see where they are.

1951
01:55:44,700 --> 01:55:45,140
Nope.

1952
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:46,120
Oh my gosh.

1953
01:55:46,460 --> 01:55:48,160
They are just chirping all over my ear.

1954
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:50,580
They are chirping all over...

1955
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:53,580
No, no, no.

1956
01:56:02,650 --> 01:56:03,690
Not blue.

1957
01:56:05,890 --> 01:56:06,410
No.

1958
01:56:06,610 --> 01:56:08,230
Oh my god, this is so bad.

1959
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:08,790
Wait.

1960
01:56:09,010 --> 01:56:09,830
Stop, stop, stop.

1961
01:56:11,150 --> 01:56:11,670
Red.

1962
01:56:11,990 --> 01:56:13,190
Go to red, please.

1963
01:56:13,950 --> 01:56:14,270
Red!

1964
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:20,130
Oh, maybe red was a bad idea.

1965
01:56:20,130 --> 01:56:20,230
Yeah.

1966
01:56:37,950 --> 01:56:41,010
I can get more health.

1967
01:56:42,630 --> 01:56:44,030
Alright, let's head out.

1968
01:56:45,010 --> 01:56:46,330
Just kidding, we are going to purple.

1969
01:56:47,290 --> 01:56:48,230
OK, good, that purple.

1970
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:49,990
Yeah, not any other purple.

1971
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:51,190
This purple is good.

1972
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:51,970
Oh my gosh.

1973
01:56:52,810 --> 01:56:53,390
Oh my god.

1974
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:54,630
Is that a dead guy?

1975
01:56:55,250 --> 01:56:55,910
Oh my god.

1976
01:56:56,730 --> 01:56:57,410
Wait a second.

1977
01:56:58,570 --> 01:57:00,010
There is a guy there.

1978
01:57:00,690 --> 01:57:01,490
Oh my gosh, please.

1979
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:03,090
No, no, no.

1980
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:06,890
Oh my god, please.

1981
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:08,930
OK, thank you.

1982
01:57:10,170 --> 01:57:11,030
Wait, who are you?

1983
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:12,010
Wait, wait!

1984
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:17,250
What was that?

1985
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,140
OK, I hear more.

1986
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,380
I wish I could see.

1987
01:57:35,540 --> 01:57:36,400
I wish I could see.

1988
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:37,480
I wish I could see.

1989
01:57:39,600 --> 01:57:40,560
Oh my gosh.

1990
01:57:42,020 --> 01:57:43,700
I can't see anything.

1991
01:57:45,140 --> 01:57:47,500
Of course, of course, of course, of course.

1992
01:57:48,220 --> 01:57:49,180
You ass.

1993
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:57,060
Anything you...

1994
01:57:57,060 --> 01:58:01,060
Summon trappers, teleport, end up in the dimension next time you are there, including enemies.

1995
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:05,760
So I could just have it full of guys, huh?

1996
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:10,040
Spell.

1997
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:11,620
Dispel magic.

1998
01:58:13,580 --> 01:58:14,220
Red.

1999
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:18,040
My turn.

2000
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,800
Anon Rivoli!

2001
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:25,760
Welcome to...Numbership, thank you!

2002
01:58:30,230 --> 01:58:31,730
Oh my gosh.

2003
01:58:33,710 --> 01:58:35,610
Oh, that's not enchanted anymore.

2004
01:58:36,470 --> 01:58:37,270
Of course not.

2005
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:41,030
Of course not.

2006
01:58:45,470 --> 01:58:46,810
Time to enchant?

2007
01:58:47,190 --> 01:58:48,850
This is so much.

2008
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:51,690
Holy moly.

2009
01:59:00,020 --> 01:59:01,360
Alright, where did he go?

2010
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:05,380
Where did he go?

2011
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:10,280
Did you...Did he put up another...Oh my gosh, he put up another one.

2012
01:59:10,460 --> 01:59:11,260
You jerk.

2013
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:18,140
Dispel magic!

2014
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:31,850
Oh my gosh.

2015
01:59:32,570 --> 01:59:33,370
Oh, he's still not dead.

2016
01:59:33,670 --> 01:59:34,970
Is he going to put up another spell?

2017
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:36,110
Or...

2018
01:59:39,670 --> 01:59:40,710
Got him.

2019
01:59:41,210 --> 01:59:42,230
We got him.

2020
01:59:43,450 --> 01:59:45,070
I think he healed in between.

2021
01:59:46,190 --> 01:59:48,350
And that's what...

2022
01:59:48,970 --> 01:59:50,970
I think that's what got me good.

2023
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:53,910
Okay!

2024
01:59:54,590 --> 01:59:58,230
I gotta stop doing that though, because I don't have so many elephant bullets, you know.

2025
02:00:02,190 --> 02:00:03,850
I think we are good.

2026
02:00:06,210 --> 02:00:06,650
Let's...

2027
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:09,610
Get this guy.

2028
02:00:10,130 --> 02:00:10,810
Oh, the lever.

2029
02:00:14,490 --> 02:00:15,890
Yeah, I have magical powers.

2030
02:00:16,110 --> 02:00:16,770
I'm so awesome.

2031
02:00:17,370 --> 02:00:24,510
I'm so cool, like I'm just a guy who can summon things and do whatever, you know.

2032
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:30,350
Alright, let's go.

2033
02:00:32,630 --> 02:00:34,350
One, two more.

2034
02:00:36,770 --> 02:00:37,170
Okay.

2035
02:00:39,170 --> 02:00:40,130
I'm screwed for...What?

2036
02:00:40,190 --> 02:00:41,350
What do you mean the elephant fight?

2037
02:00:41,530 --> 02:00:43,010
I have 23 left.

2038
02:00:43,070 --> 02:00:43,470
We're okay.

2039
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:46,910
I have other guns too.

2040
02:00:47,050 --> 02:00:47,610
We're fine.

2041
02:00:47,870 --> 02:00:49,310
The elephant fight.

2042
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,370
Where I have to fight the elephant.

2043
02:00:51,710 --> 02:00:53,530
We're going to be so...Guys, the elephant.

2044
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:56,830
We have no more elephant bullets to kill the elephant.

2045
02:00:58,470 --> 02:01:00,830
Oh, let's do this one right here.

2046
02:01:05,870 --> 02:01:08,170
The elephant takes 24.

2047
02:01:08,450 --> 02:01:09,590
Oh no!

2048
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:11,390
There's 24 elephants!

2049
02:01:14,150 --> 02:01:16,210
Okay, I don't hear anything.

2050
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:20,030
There's 24 elephants!

2051
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:22,130
Far gone!

2052
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,750
My favorite.

2053
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:31,310
The city...

2054
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:34,350
Looks like it's starting to clear up a little bit maybe.

2055
02:01:35,970 --> 02:01:37,450
Getting rid of all those guys.

2056
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:44,580
Oh, it's still enchanted.

2057
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:46,640
For how long though?

2058
02:01:46,760 --> 02:01:47,580
Wait, how do I get over there?

2059
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,340
I don't like this.

2060
02:01:53,120 --> 02:01:54,920
Wait, I don't like this at all.

2061
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:04,340
I know you guys are going to tell me to not summon a monster, but...

2062
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:07,940
What if I summoned a monster?

2063
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:14,760
Do it!

2064
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:18,520
What if I summoned a horror and had them fight?

2065
02:02:19,700 --> 02:02:21,480
I like the Kaiju battles!

2066
02:02:30,540 --> 02:02:33,900
Then he would have to die and then I would dispel the other magic.

2067
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:36,860
I want them to fight.

2068
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:39,280
Fine!

2069
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:41,080
I'll do it myself!

2070
02:02:42,180 --> 02:02:45,020
Oh, I need a gun that can...

2071
02:02:45,020 --> 02:02:45,600
Oh no!

2072
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:47,240
The enchantment went away!

2073
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:52,410
What if I do the double shotgun here?

2074
02:03:02,490 --> 02:03:03,630
Here he comes!

2075
02:03:10,280 --> 02:03:10,860
Oh my gosh.

2076
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:11,460
Get his head.

2077
02:03:11,680 --> 02:03:12,140
Get his face.

2078
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:12,760
Get his face.

2079
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:13,640
Get his face.

2080
02:03:13,960 --> 02:03:14,540
Get his face.

2081
02:03:14,660 --> 02:03:15,160
Get his face.

2082
02:03:15,280 --> 02:03:15,680
Get his face.

2083
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:16,180
Get his face.

2084
02:03:16,260 --> 02:03:16,800
Get his face!

2085
02:03:20,930 --> 02:03:22,710
What if I got everything but his face?

2086
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,910
Oh my gosh.

2087
02:03:26,210 --> 02:03:26,430
Ouch!

2088
02:03:26,530 --> 02:03:26,710
Ouch!

2089
02:03:26,770 --> 02:03:26,870
Ouch!

2090
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:27,070
Ouch!

2091
02:03:27,110 --> 02:03:27,110
Ouch!

2092
02:03:27,250 --> 02:03:27,250
Ouch!

2093
02:03:33,120 --> 02:03:34,360
Did I get him?

2094
02:03:39,550 --> 02:03:40,510
See guys?

2095
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:41,150
It was so easy.

2096
02:03:47,550 --> 02:03:48,690
RIP the big boy.

2097
02:03:49,190 --> 02:03:49,910
He had to go.

2098
02:03:49,990 --> 02:03:50,490
I'm sorry.

2099
02:03:53,350 --> 02:03:54,790
He had to go.

2100
02:03:54,990 --> 02:03:56,830
Oh there is a spider up there now.

2101
02:03:58,570 --> 02:03:59,530
Alright now.

2102
02:03:59,730 --> 02:04:00,490
Not damage.

2103
02:04:01,110 --> 02:04:01,590
Enchant...

2104
02:04:03,570 --> 02:04:04,410
We'll wait on this.

2105
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:06,050
Because I don't want it to disappear.

2106
02:04:09,410 --> 02:04:11,850
We need to get rid of those things.

2107
02:04:12,910 --> 02:04:14,870
So I need my tiny gun.

2108
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:16,950
My revolver.

2109
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:20,950
Oh come on!

2110
02:04:23,130 --> 02:04:24,050
Oh come on!

2111
02:04:25,030 --> 02:04:27,150
I could have been so Revolver Ocelot there.

2112
02:04:28,470 --> 02:04:29,570
I think I killed it.

2113
02:04:30,870 --> 02:04:31,390
Alright!

2114
02:04:32,870 --> 02:04:33,390
Let's see.

2115
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:38,590
Who just took a ton of my sanity?

2116
02:04:38,830 --> 02:04:39,910
Who just took a ton?

2117
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,450
He really parg on him.

2118
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:44,210
Thank you!

2119
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:51,210
Oh my gosh.

2120
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:52,430
I'm right up on top.

2121
02:04:53,190 --> 02:04:54,550
I'm gonna take a step back.

2122
02:04:54,690 --> 02:04:55,410
There we go.

2123
02:04:59,780 --> 02:05:01,100
Oh yeah, dispel.

2124
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:05,240
Didn't I set this to something and I'm just not using it because I'm an idiot?

2125
02:05:05,420 --> 02:05:05,920
Sorry guys.

2126
02:05:06,380 --> 02:05:11,480
I think I definitely set this to something and I just completely forgot about it.

2127
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:25,740
I'm just more comfortable going into the menu.

2128
02:05:25,900 --> 02:05:26,560
I'll be honest.

2129
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,300
Oh, did it dis...

2130
02:05:32,160 --> 02:05:34,060
Did he reinstate it?

2131
02:05:37,480 --> 02:05:37,960
Chuu!

2132
02:05:39,180 --> 02:05:40,180
I took your sanity.

2133
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:40,540
Sorry.

2134
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:41,240
Do you want it back?

2135
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:41,660
No!

2136
02:05:42,980 --> 02:05:43,680
I'm good.

2137
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:44,660
Thanks Ashes.

2138
02:05:49,310 --> 02:05:50,890
I'm gonna cast it just in case.

2139
02:05:59,950 --> 02:06:01,570
I think it's healing.

2140
02:06:02,910 --> 02:06:03,390
Enchant.

2141
02:06:03,730 --> 02:06:05,110
Maybe I should have enchanted this earlier.

2142
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:07,010
Maybe I'm dumb.

2143
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:07,670
Who knows.

2144
02:06:09,370 --> 02:06:10,090
Oh my god.

2145
02:06:20,490 --> 02:06:22,170
Take him down.

2146
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:24,450
Finish him!

2147
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:26,750
Cinematic!

2148
02:06:28,690 --> 02:06:30,470
Did you just put up another shield?

2149
02:06:34,370 --> 02:06:35,050
Nice.

2150
02:06:35,310 --> 02:06:35,510
OK.

2151
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:36,930
Nice.

2152
02:06:37,490 --> 02:06:38,050
Reload.

2153
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:48,360
Make up your mind!

2154
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:50,800
Make up your mind!

2155
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:52,780
Please!

2156
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:04,820
Got him.

2157
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:09,200
I'm so curious what the sanity effects are here.

2158
02:07:09,200 --> 02:07:16,300
Sorry that I'm not letting my sanity get super low, but his... Edward's health is so small I'm scared of him dying.

2159
02:07:16,940 --> 02:07:17,280
You know?

2160
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:23,580
Kablam!

2161
02:07:24,240 --> 02:07:24,840
Absolutely.

2162
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:28,380
We're a blessing.

2163
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:35,720
Otherwise I'm really curious what kind of crazy stuff you could see or happens in here.

2164
02:07:43,290 --> 02:07:46,150
We could tell your real life sanity is low instead.

2165
02:07:47,670 --> 02:07:48,430
Absolutely.

2166
02:07:50,070 --> 02:07:52,150
It's not safe.

2167
02:07:54,430 --> 02:07:56,110
The darkness is coming.

2168
02:07:56,730 --> 02:07:57,810
Why isn't it safe?

2169
02:08:05,980 --> 02:08:07,520
That was strange.

2170
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:12,600
Safe's coming real.

2171
02:08:21,380 --> 02:08:21,940
But...

2172
02:08:24,980 --> 02:08:25,540
This...

2173
02:08:26,120 --> 02:08:26,800
This way.

2174
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:30,420
Over here.

2175
02:08:32,360 --> 02:08:34,580
We pulled the lever there and it opened up here.

2176
02:08:35,860 --> 02:08:36,300
I remember.

2177
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:40,900
Alrighty, we still have two more.

2178
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:43,020
OK.

2179
02:08:44,100 --> 02:08:46,060
How is our health and everything looking?

2180
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:47,660
Our sanity is alright.

2181
02:08:47,780 --> 02:08:48,440
Everything is good.

2182
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:49,100
Everything is alright.

2183
02:08:51,320 --> 02:08:52,280
We're OK.

2184
02:08:52,600 --> 02:08:53,100
We're OK.

2185
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:55,540
We're alright.

2186
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:56,220
We're OK.

2187
02:08:58,100 --> 02:08:59,200
Reload the elephant gun.

2188
02:09:00,720 --> 02:09:01,280
Yeah.

2189
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,420
Let's do that.

2190
02:09:05,420 --> 02:09:09,740
Why can't you be like Metal Gear and reload yourself when I unequip you?

2191
02:09:12,940 --> 02:09:16,120
Why can't you be like... Why can't more games be like Metal Gear?

2192
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:19,420
Why can't every game be just Metal Gear?

2193
02:09:21,500 --> 02:09:23,200
This section is a little too long.

2194
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:29,820
It's long, but it's not so bad now that we got the hang of it a little bit more, you know?

2195
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:32,600
I don't feel...

2196
02:09:32,600 --> 02:09:36,680
After this part, how much longer is there though?

2197
02:09:36,980 --> 02:09:37,380
I wonder.

2198
02:09:37,940 --> 02:09:38,800
I guess we'll see.

2199
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:42,740
Any creatures?

2200
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:44,220
No creatures.

2201
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:51,140
Oh my gosh!

2202
02:09:51,380 --> 02:09:52,120
Who could have guessed?

2203
02:09:52,240 --> 02:09:52,800
Far God!

2204
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:57,600
Who could have guessed?

2205
02:09:57,680 --> 02:09:59,520
I really like these views though.

2206
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:00,820
They're really awesome.

2207
02:10:07,900 --> 02:10:09,480
I think I hear a guy.

2208
02:10:11,660 --> 02:10:12,280
Nevermind.

2209
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:16,100
That's suspicious.

2210
02:10:19,020 --> 02:10:20,040
That's weird.

2211
02:10:21,280 --> 02:10:22,040
Oh?

2212
02:10:29,040 --> 02:10:30,940
That's suspicious alright.

2213
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,680
I guess we'll pull the lever and see what happens.

2214
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:39,060
What the heck is... What are these?

2215
02:10:41,040 --> 02:10:43,640
Here stands the remnants of a forgotten museum.

2216
02:10:43,860 --> 02:10:52,000
Perhaps long ago, the alcoves now sealed with clouded glass would have been filled with the creatures and artifacts of lost Enga.

2217
02:10:56,680 --> 02:10:58,400
I don't like that.

2218
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,360
That one in the corner looks too wet.

2219
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,420
Right?

2220
02:11:03,620 --> 02:11:06,600
He looks like he's going to come alive at any second.

2221
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:06,760
I like it.

2222
02:11:09,880 --> 02:11:11,860
Oh my God, he's like glistening.

2223
02:11:12,220 --> 02:11:13,780
These guys are going to come alive.

2224
02:11:15,100 --> 02:11:16,180
Him too!

2225
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:16,640
Right?

2226
02:11:17,060 --> 02:11:17,780
Oh my God.

2227
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:19,620
He looks too wet.

2228
02:11:20,620 --> 02:11:21,920
What is that thing?

2229
02:11:26,280 --> 02:11:27,400
I'm scared.

2230
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:32,480
OK, time to pull the lever and wait for our ambush.

2231
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:49,450
I didn't even notice he was in there.

2232
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:51,730
He's so small.

2233
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:53,370
I didn't even...

2234
02:11:59,440 --> 02:12:02,660
Petition to rename drinking streams to liquid courage streams.

2235
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:04,160
Absolutely.

2236
02:12:06,640 --> 02:12:10,380
He was so tiny, I didn't even know he was there.

2237
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:13,640
Oh, it's so cute.

2238
02:12:15,180 --> 02:12:16,500
Oh wait, oh yeah.

2239
02:12:16,740 --> 02:12:17,080
Equip.

2240
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,340
Mix.

2241
02:12:22,460 --> 02:12:23,500
Oh, my bad.

2242
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:24,080
Mix.

2243
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:34,970
Oh shoot.

2244
02:12:35,370 --> 02:12:36,370
Ah, no, don't examine!

2245
02:12:37,510 --> 02:12:38,410
Oh my God.

2246
02:12:39,010 --> 02:12:39,630
Ah, please!

2247
02:12:40,530 --> 02:12:40,830
No!

2248
02:12:40,990 --> 02:12:42,590
I ran right into it.

2249
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:47,670
Do you think Pius Augustus could get presidential paragon?

2250
02:12:47,670 --> 02:12:47,790
Oh my God.

2251
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:51,870
Oh look, this is actually pretty safe.

2252
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:55,070
We can get some sanity back.

2253
02:12:55,410 --> 02:12:56,090
Let's go to green.

2254
02:12:57,970 --> 02:12:58,850
Green.

2255
02:12:59,410 --> 02:13:00,590
Go right.

2256
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:02,090
Green now.

2257
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:02,930
Green.

2258
02:13:03,150 --> 02:13:03,350
Turn.

2259
02:13:03,910 --> 02:13:04,530
Turn to green.

2260
02:13:05,810 --> 02:13:06,690
Green.

2261
02:13:07,510 --> 02:13:08,130
Red.

2262
02:13:08,950 --> 02:13:09,430
Green.

2263
02:13:11,850 --> 02:13:12,730
Green.

2264
02:13:12,730 --> 02:13:13,610
Green.

2265
02:13:14,090 --> 02:13:14,310
Green.

2266
02:13:14,310 --> 02:13:14,430
Green.

2267
02:13:15,070 --> 02:13:16,430
Turn now!

2268
02:13:17,250 --> 02:13:18,670
Go to green!

2269
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:20,430
Moe moe kyun!

2270
02:13:22,940 --> 02:13:23,750
Turn green!

2271
02:13:24,810 --> 02:13:26,310
Moe moe...

2272
02:13:26,310 --> 02:13:27,390
Kyun!

2273
02:13:27,990 --> 02:13:28,730
Oh my gosh.

2274
02:13:37,890 --> 02:13:39,430
There is a guy here.

2275
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:40,070
Hello.

2276
02:13:42,030 --> 02:13:43,250
Don't mind me.

2277
02:13:46,210 --> 02:13:47,430
Don't mind me.

2278
02:13:48,190 --> 02:13:49,430
Your head?

2279
02:13:49,990 --> 02:13:50,230
Hello?

2280
02:13:50,830 --> 02:13:52,110
Are you gonna drop down now?

2281
02:13:53,290 --> 02:13:54,090
I took you out.

2282
02:13:55,470 --> 02:13:56,330
Finish him.

2283
02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:00,170
There we go.

2284
02:14:02,590 --> 02:14:04,650
That was so fast.

2285
02:14:05,830 --> 02:14:06,310
Alright.

2286
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:07,170
To purple.

2287
02:14:09,350 --> 02:14:12,650
That's what everyone said to Mint Phantom.

2288
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:13,670
They were like, purple!

2289
02:14:14,130 --> 02:14:14,690
Purple!

2290
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:15,270
To purple!

2291
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:16,830
Go to purple!

2292
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:19,570
I just replenished that.

2293
02:14:20,310 --> 02:14:21,590
Don't do this to me.

2294
02:14:22,710 --> 02:14:23,310
Ok?

2295
02:14:23,630 --> 02:14:25,130
I just replenished that.

2296
02:14:25,630 --> 02:14:26,630
Don't be like this.

2297
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:28,650
There is another guy.

2298
02:14:28,770 --> 02:14:29,650
Oh my god, you are not dead?

2299
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,240
Oh my gosh, I just replenished it.

2300
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:40,360
You jerk!

2301
02:14:44,220 --> 02:14:45,420
Lilac Paragon.

2302
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:52,300
I'm so curious about that guy over there though.

2303
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:55,720
Like that's another human.

2304
02:14:58,540 --> 02:14:59,540
Hug the wall.

2305
02:15:00,240 --> 02:15:00,900
Hug the wall.

2306
02:15:01,620 --> 02:15:02,380
Can I examine?

2307
02:15:04,260 --> 02:15:07,700
A young man's body lies hunched against the wall of the platform.

2308
02:15:08,260 --> 02:15:16,340
Blood from the viscous wounds surrounding his face and neck soaks the remnants of what appears to be a uniform with a sickly dark red.

2309
02:15:18,160 --> 02:15:19,640
You think he's fine?

2310
02:15:22,480 --> 02:15:23,040
You think he's ok?

2311
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:26,100
Now... ok.

2312
02:15:27,800 --> 02:15:29,160
Let's equip this.

2313
02:15:29,540 --> 02:15:30,720
Let's mix this.

2314
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:41,200
Let's... even if I have to shoot the small guy with the shotgun, I will.

2315
02:15:46,220 --> 02:15:47,460
Let's enchant it.

2316
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:53,700
Oh, that one guy was red though.

2317
02:15:54,280 --> 02:15:55,080
Should be fine.

2318
02:15:57,220 --> 02:15:59,420
I can't use spells in the trapper dimension.

2319
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:00,440
Oh, just kidding.

2320
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:02,460
Alright, let's go back I guess.

2321
02:16:12,040 --> 02:16:13,260
You're getting got!

2322
02:16:14,080 --> 02:16:14,600
Dummy!

2323
02:16:15,080 --> 02:16:15,580
Oh my gosh.

2324
02:16:16,640 --> 02:16:17,160
Reload!

2325
02:16:19,880 --> 02:16:20,640
Finish him?

2326
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:22,300
Sorry, I'm wasting bullets.

2327
02:16:22,380 --> 02:16:24,040
I'm wasting bullets, but...

2328
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:25,840
Reload.

2329
02:16:26,480 --> 02:16:27,520
Hurry up, hurry up, please.

2330
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:33,960
Alright.

2331
02:16:33,960 --> 02:16:34,800
Come here guy.

2332
02:16:34,960 --> 02:16:36,320
I wish I could see anything.

2333
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,660
I can't believe I still have a shield.

2334
02:16:38,760 --> 02:16:39,560
That's kind of incredible.

2335
02:16:40,460 --> 02:16:41,100
There he is, ok.

2336
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:47,580
Alright, this makes things a little bit easier.

2337
02:16:52,340 --> 02:16:53,140
Little bit...

2338
02:16:53,140 --> 02:16:55,000
Oh, dang it.

2339
02:16:56,140 --> 02:16:56,800
My shield!

2340
02:17:02,170 --> 02:17:03,190
Reload, please.

2341
02:17:03,710 --> 02:17:04,330
Reload.

2342
02:17:04,930 --> 02:17:05,850
There we go.

2343
02:17:06,510 --> 02:17:06,930
Alright.

2344
02:17:09,950 --> 02:17:10,630
Headshot?

2345
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:14,550
This guy is not going down, is he?

2346
02:17:14,950 --> 02:17:19,530
Oh my god, my controls.

2347
02:17:19,730 --> 02:17:20,850
It gets me every time.

2348
02:17:32,570 --> 02:17:34,090
Please, please, please, please.

2349
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:47,840
Oh my goodness.

2350
02:17:48,320 --> 02:17:48,800
Finally.

2351
02:17:51,040 --> 02:17:52,500
Finally, finally.

2352
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,980
And finish him.

2353
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:58,440
Give him a good old whack.

2354
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:02,220
Ok.

2355
02:18:02,940 --> 02:18:03,900
Nice, nice, nice.

2356
02:18:04,660 --> 02:18:11,900
So once a trapper takes you to the trapper dimension, you...then...

2357
02:18:14,200 --> 02:18:15,340
You...it dies?

2358
02:18:15,880 --> 02:18:16,360
I guess?

2359
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:17,780
They die.

2360
02:18:17,960 --> 02:18:18,320
Interesting.

2361
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:24,440
I never realized.

2362
02:18:25,140 --> 02:18:26,760
Maybe because I just always one-shot them.

2363
02:18:26,960 --> 02:18:28,260
With my gun.

2364
02:18:29,460 --> 02:18:30,180
Alright.

2365
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:31,700
Let's leave.

2366
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:37,260
And do this one...one...or two more, I think.

2367
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:38,480
Or is there one more?

2368
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:40,160
Can't remember.

2369
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:44,240
Let's go.

2370
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:46,640
Two more.

2371
02:18:47,240 --> 02:18:48,620
Two more, two more, two more.

2372
02:18:52,320 --> 02:18:53,480
Oh, I'm stuck.

2373
02:19:04,310 --> 02:19:06,650
I thought I heard...I thought I heard a trapper.

2374
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:12,170
This one is...Who would have guessed Bargon?

2375
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:15,250
Who would have guessed?

2376
02:19:15,790 --> 02:19:17,150
Who would have guessed?

2377
02:19:17,210 --> 02:19:19,670
Wait, so if we did this as Grandpa...

2378
02:19:19,670 --> 02:19:21,650
Why is the darkness still coming?

2379
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:22,730
Why are we still in trouble?

2380
02:19:24,550 --> 02:19:25,890
Grandpa messed up.

2381
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:27,190
Oh, Grandpa messed up.

2382
02:19:27,370 --> 02:19:29,010
Grandpa, Grandpa, we're in trouble, Grandpa.

2383
02:19:29,530 --> 02:19:30,870
Grandpa, we're in trouble.

2384
02:19:39,110 --> 02:19:41,530
Does the enchantment...

2385
02:19:43,030 --> 02:19:44,330
Also equate to the power?

2386
02:19:44,630 --> 02:19:46,390
Or is it just how long it stays enchanted?

2387
02:19:51,950 --> 02:19:53,270
I don't know if we're gonna make this.

2388
02:19:53,310 --> 02:19:54,170
I don't know if we're gonna make this.

2389
02:19:54,210 --> 02:19:55,090
I don't know if we're gonna make this.

2390
02:19:55,970 --> 02:19:56,770
That was so close.

2391
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:57,030
Nice.

2392
02:19:59,730 --> 02:20:00,370
Length only.

2393
02:20:08,860 --> 02:20:12,040
I did not mean to enchant that.

2394
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:14,680
But...I did not mean to use my elephant gun.

2395
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:15,960
But here we are.

2396
02:20:17,620 --> 02:20:18,820
The girls are fighting.

2397
02:20:18,960 --> 02:20:19,660
The girls are fighting.

2398
02:20:25,690 --> 02:20:27,750
Wait, I'm just gonna...

2399
02:20:29,310 --> 02:20:31,170
May the best girl win.

2400
02:20:33,390 --> 02:20:33,850
Yeah!

2401
02:20:34,030 --> 02:20:34,910
Kaiju fight!

2402
02:20:35,170 --> 02:20:37,070
Oh, that was over very quickly.

2403
02:20:37,070 --> 02:20:37,430
Ok.

2404
02:20:38,190 --> 02:20:41,290
Oh shoot.

2405
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,460
I'm strapped in here.

2406
02:20:53,480 --> 02:20:54,200
Run, run, run, run.

2407
02:20:54,360 --> 02:20:55,140
Ok, good job, good job.

2408
02:21:03,410 --> 02:21:05,150
Good job, Matthew!

2409
02:21:07,050 --> 02:21:07,630
Cheers!

2410
02:21:07,910 --> 02:21:08,270
Ohayo!

2411
02:21:08,650 --> 02:21:09,230
Ohayo!

2412
02:21:10,530 --> 02:21:11,450
Ohayo!

2413
02:21:15,470 --> 02:21:22,830
What do we win?

2414
02:21:22,890 --> 02:21:25,430
We win the opportunity to pull the lever.

2415
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:26,950
Lucky us.

2416
02:21:29,530 --> 02:21:31,330
We are the lever pullers.

2417
02:21:36,050 --> 02:21:36,970
Ok.

2418
02:21:36,970 --> 02:21:38,570
Ok, ok, ok.

2419
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:46,360
I'm exhaling over myself.

2420
02:21:46,600 --> 02:21:48,180
Are we ok on health and everything?

2421
02:21:52,670 --> 02:21:57,090
This might be silly, but I'm gonna pull myself.

2422
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,600
There we go.

2423
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:08,360
Alrighty.

2424
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:10,620
Oh, that's where we came from.

2425
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,060
But there's only just one left, right?

2426
02:22:19,860 --> 02:22:20,640
Blah, blah, blah.

2427
02:22:22,920 --> 02:22:26,500
Alright, just the one right over here.

2428
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:32,200
Okidoki.

2429
02:22:33,340 --> 02:22:33,940
Is this it?

2430
02:22:34,460 --> 02:22:35,300
Is this the last one?

2431
02:22:35,820 --> 02:22:38,160
So I probably have to choose the correct thing.

2432
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:42,340
I don't quite remember.

2433
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:45,840
We'll have to check the spell book.

2434
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:46,420
Yeah, ok.

2435
02:22:46,520 --> 02:22:48,840
Let's check the spell book for dispel.

2436
02:22:49,940 --> 02:22:50,300
Check.

2437
02:22:50,480 --> 02:22:53,300
It was Nethlic, which was the one we didn't know.

2438
02:22:53,380 --> 02:22:54,020
And Red Gormor.

2439
02:22:54,220 --> 02:22:55,240
We know Red Gormor.

2440
02:23:00,960 --> 02:23:01,680
Red Gormor.

2441
02:23:02,560 --> 02:23:02,920
Scribe!

2442
02:23:15,010 --> 02:23:15,870
What's gonna happen?

2443
02:23:16,310 --> 02:23:17,010
What's gonna happen?

2444
02:23:17,050 --> 02:23:17,450
What's gonna happen?

2445
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:25,530
Oh, we can leave!

2446
02:23:32,620 --> 02:23:38,900
Edward's meddling with the arrays has conjured incredible energies that are now building up inside the city and can't be contained for long.

2447
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:40,560
Edward needs to escape the city.

2448
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:42,060
Run, Edward!

2449
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:43,960
Edward, get out of here.

2450
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:45,500
Edward, it's time to leave.

2451
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:47,040
Oh boy.

2452
02:23:48,320 --> 02:23:50,300
Something's rumbling and it's not my tummy.

2453
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:52,480
Oh my god.

2454
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:53,380
Oh my god.

2455
02:23:58,820 --> 02:24:04,340
Do I just leave him?

2456
02:24:04,660 --> 02:24:05,120
I think.

2457
02:24:09,140 --> 02:24:10,120
Just run.

2458
02:24:12,220 --> 02:24:13,360
Wait, what's that?

2459
02:24:20,630 --> 02:24:21,650
Oh my gosh.

2460
02:24:23,890 --> 02:24:25,050
Oh, dang it.

2461
02:24:28,230 --> 02:24:28,910
Oopsie.

2462
02:24:30,510 --> 02:24:31,190
Oopsie.

2463
02:24:31,550 --> 02:24:32,390
We need a purple.

2464
02:24:36,290 --> 02:24:36,690
Purple.

2465
02:24:36,690 --> 02:24:37,090
Purple.

2466
02:24:37,590 --> 02:24:37,990
Minto.

2467
02:24:38,130 --> 02:24:38,410
Purple.

2468
02:24:38,970 --> 02:24:39,350
Purple!

2469
02:24:41,050 --> 02:24:42,010
We need to get out of here.

2470
02:24:42,070 --> 02:24:42,750
We need to get out of here.

2471
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:45,070
Is that a guy in there?

2472
02:24:45,370 --> 02:24:46,790
What if I just ignored him?

2473
02:24:47,690 --> 02:24:49,090
Oh, he's like a tiny skelly.

2474
02:24:49,690 --> 02:24:49,950
Get out.

2475
02:24:50,010 --> 02:24:50,170
Go.

2476
02:24:50,650 --> 02:24:50,870
Get.

2477
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:51,130
Get.

2478
02:24:51,430 --> 02:24:51,690
Go.

2479
02:24:51,890 --> 02:24:52,030
Go.

2480
02:24:52,210 --> 02:24:52,350
Get.

2481
02:24:52,470 --> 02:24:53,570
You're embarrassing yourself.

2482
02:24:54,250 --> 02:24:54,690
You're ugly.

2483
02:24:55,210 --> 02:24:55,610
Ugly.

2484
02:25:03,990 --> 02:25:05,030
How do I get out of here?

2485
02:25:05,890 --> 02:25:10,590
I think this way.

2486
02:25:12,590 --> 02:25:14,130
Oh wait, where's the door?

2487
02:25:15,150 --> 02:25:16,030
Where's the door?

2488
02:25:16,750 --> 02:25:17,210
This way.

2489
02:25:20,530 --> 02:25:21,530
I found it.

2490
02:25:22,490 --> 02:25:23,970
Oh my gosh, it's really rumbling.

2491
02:25:28,650 --> 02:25:29,490
This way?

2492
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:31,610
Oh, it's rumbling.

2493
02:25:32,330 --> 02:25:33,150
Oh, it's rumbling.

2494
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:36,070
OK.

2495
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:36,690
Run.

2496
02:25:36,810 --> 02:25:36,930
Run.

2497
02:25:37,990 --> 02:25:38,770
Is that sound?

2498
02:25:40,950 --> 02:25:41,990
Oh no, no, no.

2499
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:43,430
I think I can just leave.

2500
02:25:43,790 --> 02:25:44,250
Oh my gosh.

2501
02:25:46,950 --> 02:25:47,890
Let's just leave.

2502
02:25:49,850 --> 02:25:50,990
Let's just get out of here.

2503
02:25:52,610 --> 02:25:53,610
Can I...

2504
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:56,050
I can save.

2505
02:25:57,270 --> 02:25:59,530
But I should leave, probably.

2506
02:26:00,190 --> 02:26:01,610
I should probably go.

2507
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:02,210
Oh my gosh.

2508
02:26:02,650 --> 02:26:05,010
It feels like my sanity is low, but it's not actually.

2509
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:06,350
OK.

2510
02:26:06,650 --> 02:26:06,870
Go.

2511
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:07,150
Go.

2512
02:26:07,170 --> 02:26:07,410
Go.

2513
02:26:08,190 --> 02:26:08,670
Go.

2514
02:26:08,930 --> 02:26:08,930
Go.

2515
02:26:09,030 --> 02:26:09,270
Go.

2516
02:26:11,930 --> 02:26:12,410
Run!

2517
02:26:12,410 --> 02:26:12,890
Grandpa!

2518
02:26:15,590 --> 02:26:17,450
Go up those stairs, grandpa!

2519
02:26:17,570 --> 02:26:18,210
Oh my god.

2520
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:19,650
Wait, what about my house?

2521
02:26:19,810 --> 02:26:20,730
Am I going to be OK?

2522
02:26:21,230 --> 02:26:22,710
Oh, cutscene.

2523
02:26:32,980 --> 02:26:34,420
Oh my god.

2524
02:26:34,520 --> 02:26:35,780
This is a dream come true.

2525
02:26:40,850 --> 02:26:41,670
Let's go, grandpa.

2526
02:26:42,350 --> 02:26:43,050
Let's go.

2527
02:26:43,110 --> 02:26:43,750
Part gone.

2528
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:45,370
48 years later.

2529
02:26:48,270 --> 02:26:49,030
That's me.

2530
02:26:49,690 --> 02:26:50,750
Oh, that's my grandpa.

2531
02:26:51,050 --> 02:26:51,570
That's not me.

2532
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,460
We didn't dispel everything.

2533
02:27:02,080 --> 02:27:02,440
No.

2534
02:27:03,380 --> 02:27:06,060
Of course not, because why else would we be doing all of this?

2535
02:27:06,920 --> 02:27:07,400
Ventrel!

2536
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:08,040
Welcome to my workshop.

2537
02:27:08,200 --> 02:27:08,580
Thank you.

2538
02:27:11,160 --> 02:27:13,080
That's how they got my grandpa.

2539
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:17,080
It was that thing.

2540
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:19,480
Chapter complete.

2541
02:27:20,960 --> 02:27:22,360
Gosh, that took me a long time.

2542
02:27:40,230 --> 02:27:40,930
Yippee!

2543
02:27:53,850 --> 02:27:56,650
Only one?

2544
02:27:58,810 --> 02:28:00,910
Only one?

2545
02:28:04,090 --> 02:28:05,490
Treachery?

2546
02:28:15,810 --> 02:28:16,550
What?

2547
02:28:16,550 --> 02:28:19,890
He's like...I don't know what you're talking about.

2548
02:28:26,430 --> 02:28:28,730
I want to team up with Augustus.

2549
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:39,450
Wow.

2550
02:28:57,850 --> 02:29:00,650
Once again?

2551
02:29:03,910 --> 02:29:06,730
When were they here before?

2552
02:29:09,870 --> 02:29:10,430
Tome.

2553
02:29:12,750 --> 02:29:13,630
Grandpa, no.

2554
02:29:13,950 --> 02:29:15,850
Only one tome chapter in MC side.

2555
02:29:18,890 --> 02:29:23,010
She's like totally fine for a person who just discovered how their grandpa died.

2556
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:27,310
A small note written on a page from the Tome of Eternal Darkness.

2557
02:29:27,870 --> 02:29:35,050
Dear Alex, I have left you a small surprise to keep you going when everything seems to go awry.

2558
02:29:35,730 --> 02:29:38,090
It was my favorite...tipple?

2559
02:29:39,210 --> 02:29:41,870
And there are several burials of it in the basement.

2560
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:44,190
Please help yourself to what you can find.

2561
02:29:44,630 --> 02:29:47,070
My guess is that I won't be needing it.

2562
02:29:47,390 --> 02:29:49,090
Your loving grandfather, Edward.

2563
02:29:49,710 --> 02:29:50,650
What is a tipple?

2564
02:29:52,250 --> 02:29:54,970
Sorry, I forgot our sanity is so low.

2565
02:30:01,160 --> 02:30:02,240
So we're going to the basement?

2566
02:30:03,480 --> 02:30:04,880
Oh, grandpa's booze!

2567
02:30:08,200 --> 02:30:08,800
Let's go.

2568
02:30:09,060 --> 02:30:13,080
I forgot last time since I left before you ended, but Alexandra can get a shot on the wall in the basement.

2569
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,340
I missed it before.

2570
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:15,380
Oh, no way, really?

2571
02:30:17,040 --> 02:30:19,140
Well, since we're going back to the basement, let's go.

2572
02:30:23,670 --> 02:30:27,570
I noticed my sanity is doing something weird in the corner.

2573
02:30:27,750 --> 02:30:28,550
I'm not sure what.

2574
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:30,830
It's like flickering.

2575
02:30:31,030 --> 02:30:31,530
I don't know why.

2576
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:33,790
Yeah, who needs sanity?

2577
02:30:37,230 --> 02:30:38,670
Yeah, I should save, shouldn't I?

2578
02:30:38,910 --> 02:30:40,290
Thank you for reminding me.

2579
02:30:40,550 --> 02:30:45,050
Oh, Edward.

2580
02:30:46,870 --> 02:30:49,630
We've gone through...we've been through three rooibuses now.

2581
02:30:49,690 --> 02:30:50,350
It's kind of fun.

2582
02:30:54,350 --> 02:30:55,310
It's exciting.

2583
02:31:04,770 --> 02:31:06,530
Oh, I don't like this one.

2584
02:31:07,910 --> 02:31:09,730
Oh, it sounds like really...

2585
02:31:11,590 --> 02:31:12,710
Oh, my God.

2586
02:31:13,550 --> 02:31:14,850
Oh, my God.

2587
02:31:16,010 --> 02:31:19,670
Where is the...is it...we still haven't figured out this thing.

2588
02:31:20,050 --> 02:31:21,010
Is it in the safe?

2589
02:31:22,290 --> 02:31:23,950
Oh, we need the stethoscope.

2590
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:26,130
Oh, the walls are bleeding again.

2591
02:31:31,330 --> 02:31:33,710
We did this with the coin.

2592
02:31:39,070 --> 02:31:40,590
The music starts.

2593
02:31:40,750 --> 02:31:41,650
Oh, hello.

2594
02:31:43,650 --> 02:31:45,170
I will take that.

2595
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:45,930
Thank you.

2596
02:31:47,390 --> 02:31:48,370
Got the shotgun.

2597
02:31:49,430 --> 02:31:51,050
Is this grandpa's magic?

2598
02:31:51,710 --> 02:31:52,070
No.

2599
02:31:53,350 --> 02:31:55,010
Did he put it...wait, examine.

2600
02:31:55,730 --> 02:31:57,830
Oh, there's something stashed between the barrels of port.

2601
02:31:57,830 --> 02:31:58,790
Should Alice pull it out?

2602
02:31:58,890 --> 02:31:59,230
Yes.

2603
02:31:59,750 --> 02:32:01,830
A pickaxe?

2604
02:32:02,670 --> 02:32:03,130
Minecraft?

2605
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:06,730
I'm playing Minecraft now.

2606
02:32:07,190 --> 02:32:08,170
Oh, I cannot use it.

2607
02:32:08,770 --> 02:32:10,830
Where do I...

2608
02:32:12,620 --> 02:32:13,890
Is there anything in here?

2609
02:32:13,990 --> 02:32:14,550
Oh, yes.

2610
02:32:19,730 --> 02:32:22,410
Doesn't quite seem to be for this.

2611
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:26,550
I am Steve.

2612
02:32:30,570 --> 02:32:31,470
Let's see.

2613
02:32:31,970 --> 02:32:34,010
What can we knock down?

2614
02:32:34,130 --> 02:32:34,750
Is it this?

2615
02:32:35,090 --> 02:32:35,850
It wouldn't be this.

2616
02:32:35,930 --> 02:32:36,650
These are just barrels.

2617
02:32:39,050 --> 02:32:41,230
And it wouldn't be this.

2618
02:32:43,450 --> 02:32:43,950
No.

2619
02:32:45,350 --> 02:32:47,170
What other things were boarded up?

2620
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:50,390
I think the ladies crying are just gonna get on my nerves at this point.

2621
02:32:50,550 --> 02:32:52,890
So I'm going to heal myself.

2622
02:32:57,170 --> 02:32:58,730
I'm just annoyed at this point.

2623
02:33:04,130 --> 02:33:04,590
Okay.

2624
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:07,990
Alright, so finally some peace and quiet.

2625
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:13,730
What was boarded up?

2626
02:33:13,830 --> 02:33:15,030
What was...

2627
02:33:16,110 --> 02:33:17,770
Oh, that room upstairs?

2628
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:19,710
I thought we would need an axe.

2629
02:33:19,890 --> 02:33:21,290
Like an actual axe for that.

2630
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:22,210
Not a pickaxe.

2631
02:33:22,790 --> 02:33:23,570
Let's see.

2632
02:33:25,050 --> 02:33:26,310
Let's see if it works.

2633
02:33:27,210 --> 02:33:29,270
On this room, right?

2634
02:33:30,310 --> 02:33:31,330
Can I use it here?

2635
02:33:34,010 --> 02:33:35,050
No way!

2636
02:33:38,050 --> 02:33:39,790
Why are we using a pickaxe?

2637
02:33:41,690 --> 02:33:42,210
That's...

2638
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:44,590
Doesn't seem like the appropriate...

2639
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:45,130
I don't know.

2640
02:33:47,130 --> 02:33:48,890
Alex is so hot, isn't she?

2641
02:33:48,890 --> 02:33:53,130
Her and like Laura Croft look like they get along together.

2642
02:33:56,690 --> 02:33:57,470
Maximum...

2643
02:34:00,090 --> 02:34:01,590
What are you doing?

2644
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:03,810
Oh my God!

2645
02:34:05,310 --> 02:34:06,770
Oh my God!

2646
02:34:06,890 --> 02:34:07,910
Grandpa's grandpa!

2647
02:34:08,470 --> 02:34:09,690
What are you doing?

2648
02:34:11,930 --> 02:34:13,230
He killed all of them.

2649
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:16,390
Oh!

2650
02:34:17,850 --> 02:34:18,910
Oh, woah, woah.

2651
02:34:18,990 --> 02:34:19,830
Woah, what's going on?

2652
02:34:24,230 --> 02:34:24,630
Dispel?

2653
02:34:24,830 --> 02:34:25,490
Is it a 7?

2654
02:34:41,640 --> 02:34:43,120
Grandpa's just a little paranoid.

2655
02:34:43,720 --> 02:34:44,860
Oh, that didn't do anything.

2656
02:34:46,580 --> 02:34:48,100
I'm afraid of... Okay, hold on.

2657
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:50,120
Wait, examine.

2658
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:53,660
Ouch!

2659
02:34:58,060 --> 02:35:00,660
Sorry, I was thinking...

2660
02:35:00,660 --> 02:35:01,780
I'm an idiot.

2661
02:35:01,940 --> 02:35:02,920
Sorry, it's blue.

2662
02:35:04,500 --> 02:35:05,400
Try blue.

2663
02:35:05,560 --> 02:35:06,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2664
02:35:06,400 --> 02:35:06,880
Sorry.

2665
02:35:10,620 --> 02:35:12,900
I'm too green brained right now, you know?

2666
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:15,600
Everything is green.

2667
02:35:16,060 --> 02:35:16,540
Red, green.

2668
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:19,400
Oh my God, no wonder they boarded up this room.

2669
02:35:20,440 --> 02:35:21,540
There's blood everywhere.

2670
02:35:22,620 --> 02:35:23,140
Scary!

2671
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:27,380
Oh my gosh.

2672
02:35:29,360 --> 02:35:33,080
If you remember his chapter, some of the staff were secret bone thieves.

2673
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:35,580
Yeah, I do remember.

2674
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:38,720
So that's why he went to the asylum.

2675
02:35:39,460 --> 02:35:40,400
That's so sad.

2676
02:35:43,880 --> 02:35:44,480
Examine.

2677
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:52,540
Should Alex retrieve it?

2678
02:35:53,080 --> 02:35:53,480
Yes.

2679
02:35:54,040 --> 02:35:56,180
Oh wow, that's an old boy.

2680
02:35:57,100 --> 02:35:58,600
And then we get another thing.

2681
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,540
Should Alex retrieve the piece of paper?

2682
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:04,900
Yes.

2683
02:36:06,160 --> 02:36:08,520
It was actually only a tier 3 barrier.

2684
02:36:08,520 --> 02:36:12,020
Oh, which is fitting because that's all Max had access to.

2685
02:36:13,520 --> 02:36:14,000
Fair.

2686
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:16,040
It's hard to tell.

2687
02:36:16,320 --> 02:36:16,760
It's a fight.

2688
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:18,480
We get our magic back so easily.

2689
02:36:20,060 --> 02:36:21,080
Journal of M.

2690
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:21,440
Roivas.

2691
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:23,600
Closing notes.

2692
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:28,400
This is a page from Maximilian Roivas' journal.

2693
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:35,560
It reads, As I contemplated these ideas, my suspicions of my servants grew and I became increasingly fearful of them.

2694
02:36:35,820 --> 02:36:37,300
I began to watch them carefully.

2695
02:36:37,300 --> 02:36:40,120
Days ago, I watched one of them stretch his neck.

2696
02:36:40,620 --> 02:36:43,480
I could have sworn I saw it twist in a most peculiar direction.

2697
02:36:44,440 --> 02:36:48,300
And a bulge of muscle tissue collect and grow in the most incorrect of manners.

2698
02:36:48,720 --> 02:36:54,380
As if a bone was being displaced from its proper location and something else moving in its place.

2699
02:36:55,760 --> 02:37:02,560
I stumbled away, knowing that I was surrounded by unholy creatures that wore the skins of mortal men and women.

2700
02:37:03,760 --> 02:37:05,400
I had to take action.

2701
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:12,060
Dear God, let my hand be swift and merciful, lest the world see more of these diabolic creatures.

2702
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:16,960
I like how her hair looks like a cute doggy's face when she is looking down while facing the camera.

2703
02:37:18,840 --> 02:37:19,320
Alex?

2704
02:37:26,230 --> 02:37:27,830
I can't get her to look down.

2705
02:37:28,790 --> 02:37:31,130
Oh my god, it does look like a dog!

2706
02:37:33,030 --> 02:37:34,010
I see it.

2707
02:37:34,010 --> 02:37:35,850
I see the eyes and the big nose.

2708
02:37:36,990 --> 02:37:39,090
Oh my god, it looks like a dog!

2709
02:37:40,430 --> 02:37:42,390
She's got that dog in her.

2710
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:48,080
No!

2711
02:37:48,460 --> 02:37:50,540
No, this is our sanity, right?

2712
02:37:50,740 --> 02:37:51,380
No way.

2713
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:53,440
No way!

2714
02:37:57,440 --> 02:37:58,240
Oh my god!

2715
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,280
Yeah, this is our sanity.

2716
02:37:59,560 --> 02:38:00,320
This is our sanity!

2717
02:38:00,860 --> 02:38:01,600
We're going crazy!

2718
02:38:03,140 --> 02:38:03,580
Oh my god!

2719
02:38:03,920 --> 02:38:04,720
This is our sanity!

2720
02:38:05,900 --> 02:38:06,340
Oh my god!

2721
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:08,300
Bone, bone, bone, bone!

2722
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:16,180
I'm dying?

2723
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:17,880
Wait...

2724
02:38:20,180 --> 02:38:20,720
Oh my god.

2725
02:38:20,840 --> 02:38:21,560
I'm pushing up!

2726
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:22,100
I'm pushing up!

2727
02:38:30,860 --> 02:38:32,100
This is our sanity, right?

2728
02:38:32,960 --> 02:38:34,020
This is our sanity, right?

2729
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:37,760
Oh, ok.

2730
02:38:39,600 --> 02:38:40,960
Oh my god, there are so many creatures.

2731
02:38:41,620 --> 02:38:42,300
Oh my god!

2732
02:38:42,780 --> 02:38:43,560
It's not our sanity?

2733
02:38:47,640 --> 02:38:48,800
Alex is in the realm.

2734
02:38:49,820 --> 02:38:50,400
Oh my god.

2735
02:38:50,780 --> 02:38:52,360
Oh my god, Alex is...

2736
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:53,240
Oh my god, no, no, no.

2737
02:38:53,620 --> 02:38:54,140
My safety!

2738
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:55,140
My safety!

2739
02:38:55,140 --> 02:38:57,140
You were never sane to begin with.

2740
02:38:57,620 --> 02:38:58,100
No!

2741
02:39:00,240 --> 02:39:01,720
What's my health looking like?

2742
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:03,660
Ok, we really need to get more sanity though.

2743
02:39:05,080 --> 02:39:05,820
Oh, dang it.

2744
02:39:06,040 --> 02:39:07,360
I pressed the wrong button.

2745
02:39:15,560 --> 02:39:18,620
For the little creatures, for the little guys we'll...

2746
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:23,180
Dutch angle no more!

2747
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:26,820
For the little guys we'll use the gun.

2748
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:29,580
Oh my gosh.

2749
02:39:34,930 --> 02:39:35,750
Oh my god.

2750
02:39:36,230 --> 02:39:38,270
No, Alex, you're not supposed to be here!

2751
02:39:38,650 --> 02:39:40,070
You're not supposed to be here!

2752
02:39:42,490 --> 02:39:44,010
Yeah, kill him.

2753
02:39:44,650 --> 02:39:45,670
And kill the next one.

2754
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:47,630
Yeah, kill him.

2755
02:39:51,190 --> 02:39:53,830
What do you think was keeping all the monsters at bay all this time?

2756
02:39:53,870 --> 02:39:54,750
And you got rid of it.

2757
02:40:00,450 --> 02:40:01,250
The barrier?

2758
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:03,550
Oh no.

2759
02:40:14,890 --> 02:40:15,530
It's gone.

2760
02:40:15,610 --> 02:40:16,210
It was just one.

2761
02:40:17,910 --> 02:40:18,690
For now.

2762
02:40:19,790 --> 02:40:21,230
It was just one for now.

2763
02:40:22,090 --> 02:40:22,750
Oh shoot.

2764
02:40:27,350 --> 02:40:28,890
Alright, we gotta make it to the basement.

2765
02:40:29,030 --> 02:40:30,450
We gotta make it there alive.

2766
02:40:36,210 --> 02:40:37,230
Nice call.

2767
02:40:38,670 --> 02:40:41,430
Why do you look so fabulous standing there?

2768
02:40:42,210 --> 02:40:44,770
Actually, maybe I will use the shotgun.

2769
02:40:45,190 --> 02:40:46,550
It has 7 rounds in it.

2770
02:40:55,890 --> 02:40:57,950
Can you guys stay down please?

2771
02:41:00,350 --> 02:41:02,330
Can you guys stay down please?

2772
02:41:02,330 --> 02:41:06,610
Just go.

2773
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:07,590
Just run.

2774
02:41:09,970 --> 02:41:11,490
Just go Alex!

2775
02:41:11,570 --> 02:41:12,450
Just go!

2776
02:41:12,910 --> 02:41:14,950
You don't need to attack all of them.

2777
02:41:15,410 --> 02:41:16,890
Just go to the basement.

2778
02:41:20,930 --> 02:41:21,910
Are you OK?

2779
02:41:24,590 --> 02:41:25,550
We're fine.

2780
02:41:26,050 --> 02:41:26,690
We're OK.

2781
02:41:27,170 --> 02:41:27,630
Probably.

2782
02:41:28,310 --> 02:41:29,570
Everything is fine.

2783
02:41:29,670 --> 02:41:30,310
Everything is OK.

2784
02:41:34,030 --> 02:41:34,630
Alright.

2785
02:41:36,150 --> 02:41:38,150
Should Alex try to open the safe?

2786
02:41:38,710 --> 02:41:39,270
Yes.

2787
02:41:41,970 --> 02:41:43,270
I have a confession.

2788
02:41:44,830 --> 02:41:45,430
I...OK.

2789
02:41:47,030 --> 02:41:50,990
I'm so bad with these types of locks.

2790
02:41:51,170 --> 02:41:52,930
So I had one when I was living in Japan.

2791
02:41:53,670 --> 02:41:55,610
And I couldn't ever get it open.

2792
02:41:56,190 --> 02:42:00,170
And I was too anxious to talk with the people running the building.

2793
02:42:00,450 --> 02:42:02,010
That I just never got my mail.

2794
02:42:02,290 --> 02:42:04,990
Like the entire time that I lived in Japan.

2795
02:42:05,630 --> 02:42:08,550
They taught me once and I was too afraid to ask them again.

2796
02:42:10,210 --> 02:42:11,170
And so...

2797
02:42:13,630 --> 02:42:14,110
I...

2798
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:18,330
I just never checked my mail ever.

2799
02:42:19,330 --> 02:42:25,580
I hope there was nothing important in there.

2800
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:33,560
I have to wait for a click, right?

2801
02:42:38,020 --> 02:42:40,620
OK, I can't hear the click over all this ambience.

2802
02:42:58,030 --> 02:42:59,990
Am I going to...OK, reset.

2803
02:43:01,690 --> 02:43:01,990
OK.

2804
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:13,740
Oh, right, left, right.

2805
02:43:15,540 --> 02:43:16,380
So, right.

2806
02:43:24,110 --> 02:43:25,490
Nice and easy.

2807
02:43:26,850 --> 02:43:28,050
Clockwise first.

2808
02:43:28,150 --> 02:43:28,330
OK.

2809
02:43:28,810 --> 02:43:30,450
I was pressing...

2810
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:33,110
OK, I get it.

2811
02:43:37,640 --> 02:43:38,560
Oh!

2812
02:43:39,620 --> 02:43:42,920
OK, but...the...but it's...

2813
02:43:48,370 --> 02:43:50,510
This makes no sense!

2814
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:55,790
Actually, this makes more sense.

2815
02:44:05,620 --> 02:44:07,880
It makes sense in my brain, OK?

2816
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:09,960
The other direction makes sense in my brain.

2817
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:10,880
You have to understand.

2818
02:44:11,260 --> 02:44:13,360
Because this side, the numbers are going left.

2819
02:44:13,640 --> 02:44:17,100
But in the other way, the numbers are going to the right even though they are going downwards.

2820
02:44:17,620 --> 02:44:18,420
Does it make sense?

2821
02:44:19,360 --> 02:44:20,940
It makes sense to me.

2822
02:44:26,950 --> 02:44:27,830
Trying the D-pad.

2823
02:44:48,260 --> 02:44:50,040
Oh my gosh, my D-pad is...

2824
02:44:52,180 --> 02:44:55,380
I'm having to really push on this thing.

2825
02:44:58,800 --> 02:45:00,440
Oh my god, please.

2826
02:45:09,820 --> 02:45:11,080
Is that a click?

2827
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:16,840
Oh my god.

2828
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,980
Most of the kids in my high school left their locks preset for the first two numbers.

2829
02:45:23,140 --> 02:45:24,960
All I had to do was turn the dial lock enough...

2830
02:45:25,520 --> 02:45:25,960
Wow!

2831
02:45:28,440 --> 02:45:29,400
Snowy, welcome to membership.

2832
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:29,980
Thank you!

2833
02:45:38,420 --> 02:45:39,980
Oh my god, please.

2834
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:41,700
We are already almost there.

2835
02:45:51,810 --> 02:45:52,930
Come on.

2836
02:45:54,790 --> 02:45:55,210
Hello?

2837
02:45:57,870 --> 02:46:00,330
We need that guy that picks locks.

2838
02:46:00,430 --> 02:46:02,530
We need a lock lawyer, whatever his name is.

2839
02:46:13,410 --> 02:46:15,110
I'm almost back at the beginning.

2840
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:18,330
The lock picking lawyer, yeah.

2841
02:46:20,150 --> 02:46:22,150
The first to the right is supposed to be 59.

2842
02:46:22,570 --> 02:46:23,870
I don't know why it didn't clunk.

2843
02:46:24,930 --> 02:46:26,770
Let's try again.

2844
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:29,950
59?

2845
02:46:32,570 --> 02:46:33,330
Let's try it.

2846
02:46:33,430 --> 02:46:34,590
Maybe I just didn't hear it.

2847
02:46:34,770 --> 02:46:36,410
I'm going to turn up the sound.

2848
02:47:01,780 --> 02:47:03,200
Do I need to go the other direction?

2849
02:47:05,640 --> 02:47:06,720
Yeah, let's try the other way.

2850
02:47:15,080 --> 02:47:17,220
It was the other way.

2851
02:47:17,420 --> 02:47:18,160
Alright.

2852
02:47:31,750 --> 02:47:33,590
This is a workout.

2853
02:47:34,750 --> 02:47:35,490
Oh my god.

2854
02:47:36,530 --> 02:47:38,410
I'm having to push really hard.

2855
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:01,320
Please.

2856
02:48:02,880 --> 02:48:03,620
Next one.

2857
02:48:03,620 --> 02:48:05,180
One after.

2858
02:48:05,440 --> 02:48:05,820
This one.

2859
02:48:06,260 --> 02:48:06,620
Next one.

2860
02:48:12,780 --> 02:48:15,500
Oh my god.

2861
02:48:31,470 --> 02:48:34,330
It shouldn't be this difficult.

2862
02:48:36,750 --> 02:48:37,870
It shouldn't be.

2863
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:40,170
It shouldn't be this hard.

2864
02:48:51,570 --> 02:48:52,290
Oh my god.

2865
02:48:52,350 --> 02:48:54,770
Please, we are already almost to 70.

2866
02:49:01,210 --> 02:49:02,450
OK, it's starting to get easier.

2867
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:06,130
OK, now I go back the other direction, alright?

2868
02:49:06,690 --> 02:49:07,330
Oh my god.

2869
02:49:13,750 --> 02:49:15,970
But the right button is easier than the left button.

2870
02:49:22,450 --> 02:49:23,930
One more kaplunk.

2871
02:49:31,160 --> 02:49:32,520
One more kaplunk.

2872
02:49:42,600 --> 02:49:44,080
Wow, there is a lot of stuff in here.

2873
02:49:44,820 --> 02:49:46,640
At the safe... Wait, is that a handle?

2874
02:49:46,900 --> 02:49:48,720
Is that for the observatory thing?

2875
02:49:49,160 --> 02:49:50,800
At the safe's door hinge... Wait.

2876
02:49:50,920 --> 02:49:53,980
As the safe's door hinges open, its contents are revealed.

2877
02:49:54,240 --> 02:49:57,300
Many important items left behind by Edward lie on the shelves inside.

2878
02:49:57,860 --> 02:49:58,880
Collect the items.

2879
02:49:58,940 --> 02:50:01,060
We have the essence of Chiturga.

2880
02:50:02,020 --> 02:50:05,160
We have a crankshaft.

2881
02:50:05,280 --> 02:50:06,480
Yeah, we got it.

2882
02:50:06,520 --> 02:50:07,820
Oh my gosh, we can finally do that puzzle.

2883
02:50:08,580 --> 02:50:09,980
We have a letter from Edward.

2884
02:50:10,360 --> 02:50:10,960
Her grandfather.

2885
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:16,280
And we have a chapter page.

2886
02:50:16,880 --> 02:50:18,560
Ashes to ashes.

2887
02:50:22,260 --> 02:50:23,100
Oh dad.

2888
02:50:23,600 --> 02:50:24,160
What is going on?

2889
02:50:29,120 --> 02:50:30,580
This guy is just chilling here.

2890
02:50:30,760 --> 02:50:31,560
Arms crossed.

2891
02:50:35,520 --> 02:50:37,240
A dome of metal and fire.

2892
02:50:38,100 --> 02:50:40,280
And a torrent of souls along with it.

2893
02:50:40,600 --> 02:50:42,780
Young and vibrant.

2894
02:50:45,660 --> 02:50:47,280
What does that mean?

2895
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:55,040
Far gone.

2896
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:02,960
Far gone.

2897
02:51:03,040 --> 02:51:03,440
Far gone.

2898
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,840
With this sacrifice of souls I make unto thee, great one.

2899
02:51:09,340 --> 02:51:11,460
The gate shall be ready to be opened.

2900
02:51:12,080 --> 02:51:14,660
And your freedom shall be at hand.

2901
02:51:15,720 --> 02:51:17,220
I don't like that.

2902
02:51:21,360 --> 02:51:21,880
Yes!

2903
02:51:22,320 --> 02:51:23,100
We did it.

2904
02:51:23,220 --> 02:51:23,620
We did it.

2905
02:51:23,720 --> 02:51:24,060
We did it.

2906
02:51:25,940 --> 02:51:27,460
Save the game.

2907
02:51:29,020 --> 02:51:29,960
Holy cow.

2908
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:31,500
This guy sounds like Solidus.

2909
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:32,700
Kind of, right?

2910
02:51:32,700 --> 02:51:34,060
This actually kind of sounds like Solidus.

2911
02:51:34,120 --> 02:51:34,880
I wouldn't be surprised...

2912
02:51:34,880 --> 02:51:40,720
It would be less surprising if it was a MGS1 cast.

2913
02:51:41,540 --> 02:51:42,860
Let's read our letter from Edward.

2914
02:51:50,580 --> 02:51:52,280
I'm gonna have a chicken nugget.

2915
02:51:54,360 --> 02:51:55,700
I'm gonna have a chicken nugget.

2916
02:52:02,940 --> 02:52:07,940
I believe I have slowed Augustus' plans, but not stopped them completely.

2917
02:52:08,740 --> 02:52:11,660
He will still try to bring his Ancient into this world.

2918
02:52:12,720 --> 02:52:16,120
You must continue what our ancestor Max has started.

2919
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:23,200
You must gather the artifacts and call forth an Ancient to combat what Augustus brings into this world.

2920
02:52:24,640 --> 02:52:30,720
Of the artifacts there are four, but one of these is in the clutches of Pius himself.

2921
02:52:30,720 --> 02:52:43,860
They are the Black Heart of Manta Rock, the Claw of Chiturga, the Sigil of Xelototh, the Veil of Uliath.

2922
02:52:45,260 --> 02:52:52,300
Your skill in the arcane science will not be as strong as Pius' who has had two millennium to prepare his gate.

2923
02:52:52,320 --> 02:52:53,000
That's not very fair.

2924
02:52:53,860 --> 02:52:58,480
You will need all the remaining artifacts to match his power.

2925
02:52:58,480 --> 02:53:02,100
It all rests with you, my dear.

2926
02:53:03,340 --> 02:53:05,560
I wish you well in this desperate act.

2927
02:53:06,640 --> 02:53:11,600
I wish I had more guidance for you, but I am at my wits end.

2928
02:53:11,940 --> 02:53:14,480
And I feel I am running out of time.

2929
02:53:15,720 --> 02:53:18,860
Your loving grandfather, Edward.

2930
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,860
Nom, nom, nom.

2931
02:53:32,520 --> 02:53:33,640
Oh, Seven Grandpa.

2932
02:53:39,640 --> 02:53:41,440
Well, we have the Essence of Chiturga.

2933
02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:43,520
Hold on.

2934
02:53:44,100 --> 02:53:45,720
Shush, shush, shush.

2935
02:53:45,880 --> 02:53:48,980
So we need... Oh, I'm sorry, we have the Claw.

2936
02:53:52,740 --> 02:53:56,920
Wasn't the Heart like in the library or something?

2937
02:54:00,580 --> 02:54:01,560
We have two of them.

2938
02:54:01,600 --> 02:54:01,840
We do?

2939
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:03,260
Oh yeah, there it is.

2940
02:54:03,380 --> 02:54:04,680
We have the Heart.

2941
02:54:05,740 --> 02:54:06,700
Yeah, we got that one.

2942
02:54:06,900 --> 02:54:07,460
So we have two.

2943
02:54:07,960 --> 02:54:11,240
So we need one more which is probably behind this puzzle.

2944
02:54:12,380 --> 02:54:14,500
And then we gotta get the one from Pius Augustus.

2945
02:54:15,720 --> 02:54:16,120
Alright.

2946
02:54:16,900 --> 02:54:20,180
Are we ready to do Ashes to Ashes?

2947
02:54:24,710 --> 02:54:25,670
Just two more.

2948
02:54:27,610 --> 02:54:28,170
Oh wait.

2949
02:54:28,470 --> 02:54:29,050
Sorry, my bad.

2950
02:54:29,790 --> 02:54:31,430
Let's do it.

2951
02:54:48,070 --> 02:54:49,610
I like your solid 3.

2952
02:54:50,310 --> 02:54:51,130
Look at that scene.

2953
02:54:51,330 --> 02:54:52,050
It looks like...

2954
02:54:53,990 --> 02:54:58,130
It looks like the very first scene of MGS3.

2955
02:55:06,510 --> 02:55:08,150
Michael Edwards?

2956
02:55:08,450 --> 02:55:12,010
Grandpa, why didn't you leave Elephant Gun?

2957
02:55:12,550 --> 02:55:12,990
I know.

2958
02:55:14,430 --> 02:55:15,250
1991!

2959
02:55:16,610 --> 02:55:19,370
This is the most recent one that we have.

2960
02:55:25,690 --> 02:55:27,470
It's a firefighter.

2961
02:55:33,900 --> 02:55:34,840
Hot!

2962
02:55:48,480 --> 02:55:49,880
Ok

2963
02:55:55,320 --> 02:55:56,740
Oh no!

2964
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:08,120
Get out of there!

2965
02:56:08,820 --> 02:56:09,740
Get out of there!

2966
02:56:11,680 --> 02:56:12,440
Wait, what's that growling?

2967
02:56:15,400 --> 02:56:16,520
Oh no!

2968
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:22,960
Nooooo!

2969
02:56:24,860 --> 02:56:25,800
The Diaper Chief?

2970
02:56:28,160 --> 02:56:30,020
Oh my God, it blew up.

2971
02:56:32,040 --> 02:56:32,740
Oh my God!

2972
02:56:35,340 --> 02:56:36,100
Uh oh.

2973
02:56:36,640 --> 02:56:38,380
Am I gonna be in a familiar area?

2974
02:56:39,880 --> 02:56:42,280
Am I gonna be in a familiar area?

2975
02:56:42,580 --> 02:56:43,940
But this guy's gotta have good stamina.

2976
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:45,060
He's a firefighter, right?

2977
02:56:48,140 --> 02:56:50,900
Also, was that Greg Eagles or...?

2978
02:57:04,860 --> 02:57:05,780
Oh my God.

2979
02:57:06,320 --> 02:57:07,180
He's so powerful.

2980
02:57:10,020 --> 02:57:11,340
Is anybody else alive?

2981
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,920
Yeah, that's totally him.

2982
02:57:17,940 --> 02:57:18,820
No!

2983
02:57:19,260 --> 02:57:19,860
Patterson!

2984
02:57:20,740 --> 02:57:21,700
My buddies!

2985
02:57:22,100 --> 02:57:22,680
My buddies!

2986
02:57:29,290 --> 02:57:30,990
Oh my God!

2987
02:57:33,490 --> 02:57:35,610
Wait, that looks like the tower!

2988
02:57:38,230 --> 02:57:39,250
Ok Ok

2989
02:57:47,590 --> 02:57:49,690
You couldn't...

2990
02:57:50,390 --> 02:57:51,530
You...

2991
02:57:52,050 --> 02:57:54,330
This guy's not explaining anything.

2992
02:58:03,750 --> 02:58:04,150
What?

2993
02:58:05,990 --> 02:58:07,370
This is the... What's it called?

2994
02:58:07,510 --> 02:58:11,510
This is that guy, the inspector, right?

2995
02:58:11,570 --> 02:58:12,450
That guy sucked.

2996
02:58:14,470 --> 02:58:16,850
You want me to take this to Rhode Island?

2997
02:58:29,430 --> 02:58:32,330
We have the essence of...

2998
02:58:35,430 --> 02:58:40,590
And of the ruby effigy!

2999
02:58:42,750 --> 02:58:44,390
Hey, Roberto didn't suck.

3000
02:58:44,830 --> 02:58:45,670
He kinda did.

3001
02:58:47,690 --> 02:58:48,970
He kinda was bad.

3002
02:58:49,030 --> 02:58:50,570
We got the sapphire effigy!

3003
02:58:51,870 --> 02:58:53,350
Oh my God.

3004
02:58:53,730 --> 02:58:54,370
Already?

3005
02:58:54,970 --> 02:58:57,850
We got a fire axe and a flashlight.

3006
02:59:07,170 --> 02:59:08,790
Finish him!

3007
02:59:10,350 --> 02:59:14,070
Nice Nice...

3008
02:59:15,990 --> 02:59:18,810
Nice Nice.

3009
02:59:18,810 --> 02:59:20,470
Should I do that to my friends too?

3010
02:59:20,570 --> 02:59:21,250
They might get up.

3011
02:59:21,410 --> 02:59:22,990
I see something sparkling over there.

3012
02:59:23,570 --> 02:59:24,210
Is it a person?

3013
02:59:24,730 --> 02:59:26,270
We got a flashlight this time?

3014
02:59:26,330 --> 02:59:27,030
That's crazy!

3015
02:59:30,830 --> 02:59:32,490
Let's... Oh, I can't save here yet.

3016
02:59:32,770 --> 02:59:32,990
Ok.

3017
02:59:35,790 --> 02:59:36,590
My friends!

3018
02:59:36,910 --> 02:59:38,330
They look like...

3019
02:59:38,330 --> 02:59:40,790
They look like they are among us cosplayers.

3020
02:59:43,630 --> 02:59:45,470
My friends... Yeah, let's do it to my friends.

3021
02:59:47,070 --> 02:59:47,610
Hold on.

3022
02:59:50,190 --> 02:59:50,610
Nevermind.

3023
02:59:52,490 --> 02:59:54,510
Just some bones lying about.

3024
02:59:54,790 --> 02:59:56,210
Oh yeah, that guy is gonna get up.

3025
02:59:56,650 --> 02:59:57,090
Oh my goodness.

3026
02:59:57,870 --> 02:59:58,470
Are you gonna get up?

3027
02:59:59,930 --> 03:00:02,090
Or are you just gonna be a lazy bone?

3028
03:00:05,590 --> 03:00:06,790
That's why I couldn't save.

3029
03:00:09,670 --> 03:00:11,550
This is like the torch.

3030
03:00:11,750 --> 03:00:12,430
It's like one hit.

3031
03:00:12,510 --> 03:00:12,990
It's awesome.

3032
03:00:13,490 --> 03:00:13,830
Oh my God.

3033
03:00:14,190 --> 03:00:14,530
What the?

3034
03:00:14,950 --> 03:00:16,210
How did you survive?

3035
03:00:18,210 --> 03:00:18,890
How did you?

3036
03:00:19,210 --> 03:00:20,270
I got your head though.

3037
03:00:22,470 --> 03:00:25,010
Oh, he is a big guy.

3038
03:00:25,110 --> 03:00:25,370
That's why.

3039
03:00:26,930 --> 03:00:28,750
It's almost as good as the torch.

3040
03:00:30,890 --> 03:00:31,330
Oh my God.

3041
03:00:32,610 --> 03:00:34,210
Almost as good as the torch.

3042
03:00:37,450 --> 03:00:37,870
Cinnabar.

3043
03:00:40,230 --> 03:00:40,650
Cinnabar.

3044
03:00:43,990 --> 03:00:44,810
What is that?

3045
03:00:44,910 --> 03:00:46,610
Oh, that's a person I think.

3046
03:00:47,950 --> 03:00:48,790
Anyone else?

3047
03:00:53,890 --> 03:00:55,270
Nope, just my friends.

3048
03:01:03,480 --> 03:01:04,640
Now we can.

3049
03:01:04,840 --> 03:01:05,020
Alright.

3050
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:08,920
Michael Edwards.

3051
03:01:10,340 --> 03:01:12,000
What is going on here?

3052
03:01:12,060 --> 03:01:22,900
A desiccated corpse lies sprawled on the temple floor dressed in desert combat fatigues.

3053
03:01:22,900 --> 03:01:26,140
A rifle, pistol, and a variety of ammunition lie about him.

3054
03:01:26,380 --> 03:01:28,200
The soldier appears to have gotten down fighting.

3055
03:01:28,780 --> 03:01:30,100
Should Mike collect the weapons?

3056
03:01:32,600 --> 03:01:34,240
An assault rifle!

3057
03:01:34,580 --> 03:01:35,060
Oh my God.

3058
03:01:35,860 --> 03:01:36,340
Ammunition!

3059
03:01:37,600 --> 03:01:38,340
A pistol!

3060
03:01:40,240 --> 03:01:41,200
Another pistol.

3061
03:01:42,720 --> 03:01:43,200
Grenades?

3062
03:01:47,960 --> 03:01:49,800
Tip about the rifle you are about to get.

3063
03:01:49,900 --> 03:01:53,320
If you stick to burst fire you can get the whole level using only that gun.

3064
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:01,420
Which mode is that?

3065
03:02:02,280 --> 03:02:03,060
Wait, let's check.

3066
03:02:06,260 --> 03:02:07,460
The 3 one?

3067
03:02:10,720 --> 03:02:12,340
The rifle also fires grenades.

3068
03:02:12,540 --> 03:02:13,100
That's insane.

3069
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:25,260
The objective individual combat weapon OICW is a Heckler & Koch G36 rifle mounted under a 20mm grenade cannon.

3070
03:02:25,260 --> 03:02:30,600
It is commonly assigned to special forces units.

3071
03:02:30,860 --> 03:02:35,800
This rifle uses a 30 round clip and is chambered for 5.56mm NATO ammunition.

3072
03:02:38,600 --> 03:02:39,180
Wow.

3073
03:02:39,940 --> 03:02:41,860
But I kind of like my axe too.

3074
03:02:43,300 --> 03:02:44,360
I'll equip it.

3075
03:02:49,140 --> 03:02:50,060
Here we go.

3076
03:02:55,190 --> 03:02:55,710
Oh...

3077
03:02:57,410 --> 03:02:58,950
Which mode was it?

3078
03:02:59,150 --> 03:03:00,910
I can't tell what modes these are.

3079
03:03:02,110 --> 03:03:03,290
That's the grenade.

3080
03:03:03,890 --> 03:03:04,710
That's regular.

3081
03:03:05,210 --> 03:03:05,930
Is that burst?

3082
03:03:07,270 --> 03:03:08,470
And then what is this?

3083
03:03:14,090 --> 03:03:15,370
It's the 3 bullets right?

3084
03:03:15,470 --> 03:03:15,630
OK.

3085
03:03:16,830 --> 03:03:17,550
That's what I thought.

3086
03:03:25,400 --> 03:03:26,940
Oh he took him down.

3087
03:03:29,580 --> 03:03:30,920
Don't go after me.

3088
03:03:31,240 --> 03:03:32,160
Oh he's summoning more.

3089
03:03:33,080 --> 03:03:33,500
Lame.

3090
03:03:34,100 --> 03:03:36,540
Oh I have to... He's the guy that I have to...

3091
03:03:38,280 --> 03:03:39,740
Get close buddy.

3092
03:03:39,820 --> 03:03:40,480
Get close.

3093
03:03:41,520 --> 03:03:42,560
Get close.

3094
03:03:42,740 --> 03:03:44,100
Can I switch to your head?

3095
03:03:49,510 --> 03:03:50,450
I'm scared.

3096
03:03:53,710 --> 03:03:54,930
You think he'll leave?

3097
03:04:05,850 --> 03:04:07,130
I'm stuck.

3098
03:04:07,840 --> 03:04:08,930
I'm actually stuck.

3099
03:04:10,850 --> 03:04:12,730
This is not good.

3100
03:04:13,770 --> 03:04:15,330
This is not great.

3101
03:04:16,770 --> 03:04:18,390
This is not good.

3102
03:04:18,570 --> 03:04:20,190
It's the moth from your audio book.

3103
03:04:20,330 --> 03:04:20,990
Oh my gosh.

3104
03:04:21,590 --> 03:04:22,930
She went on a date with him.

3105
03:04:24,950 --> 03:04:27,250
They went to an observatory.

3106
03:04:30,960 --> 03:04:32,600
And I don't remember what happened.

3107
03:04:43,130 --> 03:04:44,690
The babies are after me.

3108
03:04:44,990 --> 03:04:45,590
I'm leaving.

3109
03:05:10,780 --> 03:05:13,620
Oh yeah we are... Wow this area is very familiar.

3110
03:05:14,660 --> 03:05:15,480
Yes indeed.

3111
03:05:17,240 --> 03:05:19,560
For these guys I'm not gonna really waste ammo.

3112
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:21,920
I don't need to.

3113
03:05:22,260 --> 03:05:24,040
Cause I can just one shot them with this.

3114
03:05:24,600 --> 03:05:25,680
So much easier.

3115
03:05:27,700 --> 03:05:28,200
You know.

3116
03:05:29,360 --> 03:05:30,680
There's still more.

3117
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:32,980
Come on over.

3118
03:05:34,120 --> 03:05:35,160
Come on over.

3119
03:05:37,620 --> 03:05:38,380
Yup.

3120
03:05:39,440 --> 03:05:40,100
Yup.

3121
03:05:40,780 --> 03:05:41,600
And I get him.

3122
03:05:45,040 --> 03:05:46,280
We're screaming?

3123
03:05:46,980 --> 03:05:47,880
Don't worry.

3124
03:05:50,220 --> 03:05:54,200
I guess I could have gone to the trapper dimension and gotten more...

3125
03:05:55,900 --> 03:05:57,200
More sanity but...

3126
03:05:59,720 --> 03:06:01,180
Oh my gosh this area.

3127
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:02,700
No please.

3128
03:06:03,240 --> 03:06:04,620
I don't wanna be back here.

3129
03:06:05,400 --> 03:06:06,280
Okay so we have two.

3130
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:08,960
I'm just trying to explore everything through here.

3131
03:06:09,080 --> 03:06:10,160
We have two ladders.

3132
03:06:14,060 --> 03:06:15,580
Hurt me more.

3133
03:06:16,200 --> 03:06:16,700
Zombies.

3134
03:06:17,080 --> 03:06:18,200
And we have three ladders.

3135
03:06:18,340 --> 03:06:19,380
Okay let's go to the first one.

3136
03:06:26,930 --> 03:06:28,070
All the way back.

3137
03:06:32,870 --> 03:06:35,110
Yeah we do have a strong character.

3138
03:06:35,410 --> 03:06:36,290
Thank goodness right?

3139
03:06:37,210 --> 03:06:39,450
A guy who actually like runs.

3140
03:06:39,650 --> 03:06:41,070
Look at how much health he has.

3141
03:06:41,370 --> 03:06:45,070
A guy that runs and... Okay we don't have the tome yet so we can't...

3142
03:06:46,630 --> 03:06:47,510
Cast any...

3143
03:06:48,190 --> 03:06:48,630
God.

3144
03:06:53,460 --> 03:06:56,420
I'm trying to decide if I wanna just run around him or not.

3145
03:06:57,540 --> 03:06:57,920
You know what?

3146
03:06:57,940 --> 03:06:58,880
Let's go to another floor.

3147
03:07:03,560 --> 03:07:05,780
When do I get the tome of eternal darkness?

3148
03:07:06,780 --> 03:07:08,540
When do I get the tome of eternal darkness?

3149
03:07:08,920 --> 03:07:11,900
I never have I wanted the tome so much more than...

3150
03:07:11,900 --> 03:07:12,680
In these moments.

3151
03:07:13,540 --> 03:07:13,960
You know?

3152
03:07:20,780 --> 03:07:21,920
Get the little guys.

3153
03:07:26,980 --> 03:07:28,080
Get the big guy.

3154
03:07:30,040 --> 03:07:31,160
Whack, whack.

3155
03:07:31,700 --> 03:07:32,700
Get the bigger guy.

3156
03:07:33,820 --> 03:07:34,760
Get the bigger guy.

3157
03:07:36,920 --> 03:07:37,820
Oh my god.

3158
03:07:38,820 --> 03:07:40,040
Take him down.

3159
03:07:40,900 --> 03:07:41,440
Finish him.

3160
03:07:41,880 --> 03:07:43,520
Oh my god my sanity is so low.

3161
03:07:44,960 --> 03:07:46,780
Sanity goes so fast.

3162
03:07:54,010 --> 03:07:56,210
Sanity goes so fast.

3163
03:07:57,210 --> 03:07:57,930
Alright.

3164
03:07:58,330 --> 03:07:59,310
Get that guy.

3165
03:08:01,850 --> 03:08:03,330
And this guy.

3166
03:08:05,130 --> 03:08:06,870
And what are we grabbing here?

3167
03:08:08,570 --> 03:08:09,910
What is this?

3168
03:08:10,630 --> 03:08:11,350
It's a stick!

3169
03:08:12,730 --> 03:08:14,190
An odd battered staff.

3170
03:08:19,290 --> 03:08:20,590
Butcher mental.

3171
03:08:21,630 --> 03:08:23,690
We got a staff.

3172
03:08:24,730 --> 03:08:25,710
Very cool.

3173
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:29,190
Let's keep going.

3174
03:08:30,390 --> 03:08:32,050
Let's go to the next room.

3175
03:08:33,950 --> 03:08:35,750
I thought it was a wand.

3176
03:08:36,530 --> 03:08:37,330
You're a wizard.

3177
03:08:38,050 --> 03:08:38,490
Edward?

3178
03:08:38,950 --> 03:08:39,730
What's this guy's name?

3179
03:08:41,010 --> 03:08:41,530
Edwards.

3180
03:08:50,210 --> 03:08:50,590
Oh.

3181
03:08:51,350 --> 03:08:53,410
Looks like a scale replica of the area.

3182
03:08:53,790 --> 03:08:55,710
The model is made from clay and seems brittle.

3183
03:08:57,490 --> 03:09:01,650
Some of the buildings appear to have been coated with a reflective glaze.

3184
03:09:03,190 --> 03:09:03,710
Okay.

3185
03:09:04,050 --> 03:09:04,530
Puzzle.

3186
03:09:05,090 --> 03:09:07,250
So if I reflect...

3187
03:09:12,040 --> 03:09:14,580
The depression lies on the floor in front of the model.

3188
03:09:14,720 --> 03:09:15,960
Perhaps something may be placed there.

3189
03:09:16,540 --> 03:09:17,480
Like a staff?

3190
03:09:18,280 --> 03:09:19,040
No, nevermind.

3191
03:09:20,100 --> 03:09:20,720
Mix it.

3192
03:09:22,660 --> 03:09:24,280
Long staff made from hardwood.

3193
03:09:26,360 --> 03:09:30,840
One end of the staff is merely bare wood, indicating that something was once attached to the end.

3194
03:09:31,660 --> 03:09:32,620
I see.

3195
03:09:33,120 --> 03:09:34,060
I see.

3196
03:09:35,020 --> 03:09:35,980
Depression me.

3197
03:09:36,560 --> 03:09:37,080
No!

3198
03:09:41,380 --> 03:09:44,500
Okay, we have to go back to that other horrible room.

3199
03:09:48,200 --> 03:09:51,340
We have to go back to that horrible, horrible room.

3200
03:10:05,020 --> 03:10:05,600
Alright.

3201
03:10:06,460 --> 03:10:07,880
When do I get the tome?

3202
03:10:09,400 --> 03:10:10,740
It's just like Raiders, yeah.

3203
03:10:11,640 --> 03:10:12,300
It is.

3204
03:10:16,580 --> 03:10:18,060
We'll save in the second slot.

3205
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:20,860
Just in case.

3206
03:10:24,900 --> 03:10:26,420
How much...oh wow.

3207
03:10:27,160 --> 03:10:28,280
I actually have a ton of ammo.

3208
03:10:33,110 --> 03:10:34,650
But it feels like such a waste.

3209
03:10:34,930 --> 03:10:37,450
Gosh, I'm in such a survival horror game mode.

3210
03:10:38,270 --> 03:10:40,510
Don't shoot unless absolutely necessary.

3211
03:10:41,090 --> 03:10:42,890
But maybe here is absolutely necessary.

3212
03:10:43,330 --> 03:10:44,250
I don't know!

3213
03:10:46,150 --> 03:10:47,050
What is this?

3214
03:10:47,370 --> 03:10:47,870
Grab it!

3215
03:10:49,310 --> 03:10:52,490
Situated on a waist-high plinth is a gold amulet.

3216
03:10:53,770 --> 03:10:54,810
It's mine!

3217
03:10:55,690 --> 03:10:55,770
No!

3218
03:11:00,550 --> 03:11:01,890
Oh my gosh, there are two of them.

3219
03:11:03,110 --> 03:11:03,810
Just go!

3220
03:11:09,990 --> 03:11:12,230
Oh my gosh, this camera angle is evil.

3221
03:11:15,070 --> 03:11:15,590
Oh my gosh.

3222
03:11:15,590 --> 03:11:16,390
Ah!

3223
03:11:20,250 --> 03:11:21,970
Just go!

3224
03:11:23,170 --> 03:11:23,950
Just whack!

3225
03:11:28,260 --> 03:11:29,460
Don't stop whacking!

3226
03:11:29,920 --> 03:11:31,060
Don't stop whacking!

3227
03:11:33,500 --> 03:11:34,600
Finish him!

3228
03:11:34,700 --> 03:11:35,040
Finish him!

3229
03:11:35,100 --> 03:11:35,420
Finish him!

3230
03:11:37,120 --> 03:11:37,700
Oh my gosh.

3231
03:11:38,380 --> 03:11:39,240
Holy!

3232
03:11:40,660 --> 03:11:41,420
Holy!

3233
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:48,960
Survive somehow.

3234
03:11:53,740 --> 03:11:57,680
I know I have to face that room eventually, but I hate those winged guys.

3235
03:12:02,060 --> 03:12:03,060
What is this?

3236
03:12:04,260 --> 03:12:05,060
Climb up?

3237
03:12:05,380 --> 03:12:05,640
OK.

3238
03:12:07,460 --> 03:12:08,520
Am I gonna hate this room?

3239
03:12:10,820 --> 03:12:12,280
I'm gonna hate every room.

3240
03:12:13,560 --> 03:12:14,080
Hey!

3241
03:12:14,260 --> 03:12:15,580
We told them to fix this!

3242
03:12:16,540 --> 03:12:17,800
And they didn't!

3243
03:12:18,560 --> 03:12:20,300
They didn't listen to us!

3244
03:12:20,300 --> 03:12:20,460
Listen!

3245
03:12:24,690 --> 03:12:26,850
This room steals our sanity even.

3246
03:12:28,050 --> 03:12:30,330
Where is my...oh here it is.

3247
03:12:35,930 --> 03:12:39,770
You are gonna summon a new guy, aren't you?

3248
03:12:43,450 --> 03:12:44,770
Oh that's a big guy.

3249
03:12:45,470 --> 03:12:47,210
It's a big guy you just summoned there.

3250
03:12:48,190 --> 03:12:49,050
Where are you going?

3251
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:51,330
One!

3252
03:13:00,230 --> 03:13:01,490
We got one guys!

3253
03:13:02,970 --> 03:13:04,090
We got one!

3254
03:13:10,020 --> 03:13:11,400
Finish this guy.

3255
03:13:12,920 --> 03:13:14,220
And take down this guy.

3256
03:13:16,200 --> 03:13:17,160
Take him down.

3257
03:13:19,020 --> 03:13:19,960
Take him down.

3258
03:13:21,440 --> 03:13:22,020
Nice.

3259
03:13:22,960 --> 03:13:24,000
Isn't there a guy over here?

3260
03:13:24,340 --> 03:13:25,260
He is already dead.

3261
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:27,040
I'm too good at the game.

3262
03:13:31,890 --> 03:13:34,950
Yeah, we got a decent chunk of sanity back, didn't we?

3263
03:13:35,390 --> 03:13:36,370
Yeah, nice.

3264
03:13:38,770 --> 03:13:40,150
And the...what's it called?

3265
03:13:41,310 --> 03:13:42,670
The gas in this room disappeared.

3266
03:13:43,330 --> 03:13:44,710
What do I do in here?

3267
03:13:45,890 --> 03:13:49,150
I take a nice little sit on the bench.

3268
03:13:52,510 --> 03:13:53,470
Oh, here we go.

3269
03:13:56,290 --> 03:13:58,010
When do I get the dang book?

3270
03:14:07,530 --> 03:14:09,630
Oh, what is that sound?

3271
03:14:12,350 --> 03:14:15,450
Oh, we can't get him yet.

3272
03:14:17,410 --> 03:14:18,730
Turn around!

3273
03:14:19,730 --> 03:14:21,310
Turn around, Edwards!

3274
03:14:23,910 --> 03:14:27,010
OK, let's go back to the scary, scary room.

3275
03:14:28,010 --> 03:14:29,570
There has to be something in there.

3276
03:14:33,670 --> 03:14:36,410
No tome, no magic.

3277
03:14:42,070 --> 03:14:43,150
Nothing on that end.

3278
03:14:43,230 --> 03:14:44,970
Our walls are bleeding just a little bit.

3279
03:14:45,490 --> 03:14:47,190
Alright, guys, let's be brave.

3280
03:14:52,410 --> 03:14:53,290
Let's be brave.

3281
03:14:53,710 --> 03:14:54,610
I had to leave for a second there.

3282
03:14:54,710 --> 03:14:56,330
The horrors are easy to kill by double tapping.

3283
03:14:56,450 --> 03:14:57,830
Burst shots into their head when they are open.

3284
03:14:58,550 --> 03:15:00,530
A lot less scary now that you have this rifle.

3285
03:15:00,810 --> 03:15:02,750
Everything is scary still though!

3286
03:15:02,890 --> 03:15:04,150
Well, it's more so me.

3287
03:15:06,390 --> 03:15:09,150
Thinking I'm gonna miss and, you know, like...

3288
03:15:10,650 --> 03:15:12,390
And wasting all my ammo.

3289
03:15:12,770 --> 03:15:13,790
I admit, my birthday was yesterday.

3290
03:15:13,930 --> 03:15:14,230
I turned 20.

3291
03:15:14,750 --> 03:15:15,170
Carlos!

3292
03:15:15,690 --> 03:15:16,370
Happy birthday!

3293
03:15:19,210 --> 03:15:22,150
Happy birthday to you.

3294
03:15:22,450 --> 03:15:24,870
Happy birthday to you.

3295
03:15:25,490 --> 03:15:28,070
Happy birthday, dear Carlos.

3296
03:15:30,490 --> 03:15:34,130
Happy birthday to you.

3297
03:15:35,950 --> 03:15:36,810
Happy birthday!

3298
03:15:38,370 --> 03:15:39,930
We forgot to also check this amulet.

3299
03:15:40,030 --> 03:15:40,630
Let's see what this is.

3300
03:15:40,690 --> 03:15:44,570
Circular in shape with a series of jewels clustered around what appears to be a glass lens.

3301
03:15:45,010 --> 03:15:48,930
It has a fitting on one side as though it was once attached to something.

3302
03:15:55,640 --> 03:15:57,300
We got a staff!

3303
03:15:58,600 --> 03:15:59,480
Thanks, Minto!

3304
03:15:59,620 --> 03:16:00,800
Of course!

3305
03:16:02,600 --> 03:16:04,800
A long staff made from hard wood.

3306
03:16:05,240 --> 03:16:10,200
It is finished once clean and resplendent, is now dented and cracked.

3307
03:16:10,560 --> 03:16:13,460
It is topped with a gold amulet and set with a lens.

3308
03:16:13,600 --> 03:16:15,460
So this is definitely...

3309
03:16:16,520 --> 03:16:20,060
We don't even have... We can just probably run past this room again then, right?

3310
03:16:22,780 --> 03:16:23,720
Wait, what's this?

3311
03:16:24,540 --> 03:16:25,020
Nothing.

3312
03:16:25,340 --> 03:16:26,140
Just run past!

3313
03:16:26,140 --> 03:16:28,140
What's this?

3314
03:16:31,040 --> 03:16:32,720
We don't need to do anything there.

3315
03:16:33,060 --> 03:16:34,440
We just gotta go to the other room.

3316
03:16:37,560 --> 03:16:42,520
If you kill every enemy in this level with burst fire and don't miss, you'll have about 40 rounds left.

3317
03:16:42,780 --> 03:16:43,000
Okay.

3318
03:16:43,500 --> 03:16:44,820
How do you know all this, Red?

3319
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:46,220
Is this your favorite game?

3320
03:16:47,120 --> 03:16:47,440
Ever?

3321
03:16:51,060 --> 03:16:52,840
Cause you know a lot, a lot.

3322
03:16:54,020 --> 03:16:54,440
Alright.

3323
03:16:55,880 --> 03:16:57,440
Wait, what do you mean I can't use it?

3324
03:16:58,060 --> 03:16:59,340
Use it right there.

3325
03:17:00,020 --> 03:17:03,300
Oh, okay.

3326
03:17:03,560 --> 03:17:05,540
We probably gotta get them all lined up, don't we?

3327
03:17:05,980 --> 03:17:06,220
Wait.

3328
03:17:17,960 --> 03:17:19,080
Can I...

3329
03:17:21,880 --> 03:17:23,120
Can I move this?

3330
03:17:26,240 --> 03:17:27,600
Classic indie puzzle.

3331
03:17:46,880 --> 03:17:49,880
Cause it only points... It doesn't point any other way.

3332
03:17:53,560 --> 03:17:53,960
Huh.

3333
03:17:54,400 --> 03:17:55,560
The music has stopped.

3334
03:17:55,820 --> 03:17:57,740
It's like the game is like, hey, you're too dumb.

3335
03:17:59,380 --> 03:18:00,580
Oh, it can go up!

3336
03:18:00,800 --> 03:18:01,240
I'm an idiot.

3337
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:01,900
You're right.

3338
03:18:02,020 --> 03:18:04,480
Oh my gosh, for some reason I was thinking it just goes left and right.

3339
03:18:06,500 --> 03:18:06,900
Okay.

3340
03:18:08,120 --> 03:18:09,220
I'm burning it?

3341
03:18:10,120 --> 03:18:11,460
I'm setting it on fire?

3342
03:18:18,690 --> 03:18:19,870
Let's just open this thing.

3343
03:18:19,870 --> 03:18:22,450
A hidden compartment has been revealed.

3344
03:18:22,630 --> 03:18:26,370
The rear wall of the compartment is lined with polished metal forming a crude mirror.

3345
03:18:32,760 --> 03:18:34,200
Now this one.

3346
03:18:40,680 --> 03:18:44,970
Can I move it over?

3347
03:18:46,150 --> 03:18:51,010
My depth perception with this is actually really at its max.

3348
03:18:51,190 --> 03:18:53,070
I can't... What?

3349
03:18:55,830 --> 03:18:57,570
I'm actually so confused here.

3350
03:18:58,070 --> 03:18:58,930
Oh my god.

3351
03:18:59,330 --> 03:19:00,190
Please move!

3352
03:19:02,290 --> 03:19:03,490
Please move!

3353
03:19:04,030 --> 03:19:05,250
Is this as high as it can go?

3354
03:19:05,950 --> 03:19:06,150
Okay.

3355
03:19:06,850 --> 03:19:08,430
And then...

3356
03:19:09,330 --> 03:19:09,930
I...

3357
03:19:09,930 --> 03:19:11,030
There we go!

3358
03:19:11,170 --> 03:19:11,730
Oh my goodness.

3359
03:19:16,250 --> 03:19:17,230
Second mirror!

3360
03:19:17,850 --> 03:19:20,210
Okay, now upwards and over.

3361
03:19:20,850 --> 03:19:22,010
Upwards... There we go!

3362
03:19:33,540 --> 03:19:34,020
Oh!

3363
03:19:34,120 --> 03:19:34,120
Alright.

3364
03:19:34,340 --> 03:19:35,280
Wait, that's not what opened.

3365
03:19:35,740 --> 03:19:36,640
That's where we came from.

3366
03:19:37,260 --> 03:19:37,540
What?

3367
03:19:37,780 --> 03:19:38,180
It just opened.

3368
03:19:40,780 --> 03:19:41,700
Oh, right here.

3369
03:19:42,540 --> 03:19:42,860
Okay.

3370
03:19:44,300 --> 03:19:45,060
Go down.

3371
03:19:47,160 --> 03:19:48,620
It's tome time!

3372
03:19:53,810 --> 03:19:54,510
Wait a second.

3373
03:20:11,190 --> 03:20:12,630
Yes, yes, just claim it!

3374
03:20:12,630 --> 03:20:13,910
Take the tome!

3375
03:20:19,020 --> 03:20:19,740
Nice.

3376
03:20:32,360 --> 03:20:35,080
Back to the spooky room.

3377
03:20:36,080 --> 03:20:38,420
The room where I refused to kill those two guys.

3378
03:20:40,620 --> 03:20:44,620
I like how we look so awesome with our soul rifle.

3379
03:20:47,240 --> 03:20:47,960
Alrighty.

3380
03:20:48,220 --> 03:20:48,960
It was... No.

3381
03:20:49,540 --> 03:20:50,620
It was this one.

3382
03:20:51,900 --> 03:20:53,020
Wait, what room was it?

3383
03:20:59,780 --> 03:21:01,160
Wait, what was this one again?

3384
03:21:02,740 --> 03:21:04,200
Oh no, this is where we got the staff.

3385
03:21:04,280 --> 03:21:04,800
Okay, just kidding.

3386
03:21:05,620 --> 03:21:06,740
This is where we got the staff.

3387
03:21:06,920 --> 03:21:08,160
Oh yeah, we do have magic!

3388
03:21:08,640 --> 03:21:10,140
I can just shield, can't I?

3389
03:21:10,580 --> 03:21:12,620
Wait, let's check...

3390
03:21:12,620 --> 03:21:14,240
Yeah, why don't I just shield?

3391
03:21:14,600 --> 03:21:15,440
And then I can kill them.

3392
03:21:17,520 --> 03:21:18,180
They're green.

3393
03:21:23,100 --> 03:21:23,580
Wait.

3394
03:21:25,140 --> 03:21:26,700
Shield is the same color.

3395
03:21:31,340 --> 03:21:32,300
Oops.

3396
03:21:33,380 --> 03:21:35,540
I guess red is fine because it's my health.

3397
03:21:38,440 --> 03:21:39,400
Spell.

3398
03:21:40,440 --> 03:21:41,240
Let's enchant.

3399
03:21:44,800 --> 03:21:45,460
Oh no.

3400
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:50,760
Yeah, this protects HP.

3401
03:21:51,100 --> 03:21:51,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3402
03:21:52,400 --> 03:21:55,540
My sanity could use a little bit of a boost.

3403
03:21:57,480 --> 03:21:58,120
But...

3404
03:21:58,120 --> 03:21:59,280
Enchanted rifle time.

3405
03:22:01,980 --> 03:22:03,340
Will I be able to use it though?

3406
03:22:07,560 --> 03:22:08,620
I'm scared.

3407
03:22:14,200 --> 03:22:14,840
Alright.

3408
03:22:16,360 --> 03:22:16,900
Alright.

3409
03:22:18,220 --> 03:22:19,840
Alright, let's do it.

3410
03:22:28,640 --> 03:22:29,180
No!

3411
03:22:29,480 --> 03:22:30,520
Why did you die?

3412
03:22:30,820 --> 03:22:31,340
I'm trapped!

3413
03:22:33,040 --> 03:22:34,260
Why did you die?

3414
03:22:35,680 --> 03:22:37,100
Why did you die?

3415
03:22:38,020 --> 03:22:38,940
Can you lift up?

3416
03:22:39,340 --> 03:22:40,180
Can I get the other guy?

3417
03:22:40,520 --> 03:22:41,480
Can someone lift up?

3418
03:22:41,640 --> 03:22:43,000
Can someone do anything?

3419
03:22:43,120 --> 03:22:43,440
Oh my god.

3420
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:44,160
Please.

3421
03:22:45,080 --> 03:22:45,440
No!

3422
03:22:46,600 --> 03:22:47,560
I give up!

3423
03:22:47,760 --> 03:22:48,480
I give up!

3424
03:22:51,880 --> 03:22:53,140
I hate these guys.

3425
03:22:53,280 --> 03:22:54,480
I hate them so much.

3426
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:55,780
I hate these guys.

3427
03:22:55,940 --> 03:22:57,400
I'm never dealing with them ever again.

3428
03:22:57,660 --> 03:22:59,280
If I see them ever again I'm running.

3429
03:22:59,580 --> 03:23:00,240
I don't care.

3430
03:23:00,380 --> 03:23:01,760
I don't care about anything.

3431
03:23:01,880 --> 03:23:02,400
I hate them.

3432
03:23:02,560 --> 03:23:03,580
I hate them so much.

3433
03:23:03,800 --> 03:23:04,440
I hate them.

3434
03:23:04,680 --> 03:23:05,840
I hate them!

3435
03:23:09,720 --> 03:23:14,820
This stupid fucking controller moves around too much for me to just focus on their head!

3436
03:23:16,860 --> 03:23:18,080
I'm going to go get tea.

3437
03:25:21,260 --> 03:25:22,100
I'm back.

3438
03:25:26,360 --> 03:25:27,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3439
03:25:27,720 --> 03:25:28,040
Hold on.

3440
03:25:32,440 --> 03:25:36,320
Thanks for all the superchats!

3441
03:25:37,580 --> 03:25:38,540
Thank you!

3442
03:25:40,360 --> 03:25:42,880
Oh no, I didn't get some of the syrup off my fingers.

3443
03:25:44,720 --> 03:25:48,320
Sorry, did you have to listen to baby crying this whole time while I was gone?

3444
03:25:48,780 --> 03:25:49,780
I'm so sorry.

3445
03:25:49,780 --> 03:25:49,840
I'm so sorry.

3446
03:25:54,380 --> 03:25:55,880
What was I doing?

3447
03:25:56,340 --> 03:25:57,360
Oh yeah, I was just paused.

3448
03:25:57,780 --> 03:26:00,880
Alright, to this room.

3449
03:26:02,500 --> 03:26:03,560
Yeah, it was awful.

3450
03:26:03,720 --> 03:26:04,260
I'm so sorry.

3451
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:09,980
Oh yeah, let's regain our cover.

3452
03:26:11,560 --> 03:26:13,300
We'll do it at an extreme level.

3453
03:26:22,840 --> 03:26:24,640
Hey, go away!

3454
03:26:25,200 --> 03:26:26,720
It's not supposed to be drippy anymore.

3455
03:26:27,340 --> 03:26:28,840
My sanity is healed!

3456
03:26:28,980 --> 03:26:29,380
Please!

3457
03:26:30,800 --> 03:26:31,180
Please!

3458
03:26:34,020 --> 03:26:37,380
Alright, let's go down.

3459
03:26:38,340 --> 03:26:39,380
Let's dispel.

3460
03:26:41,700 --> 03:26:43,440
Why is it still drippy?

3461
03:26:46,640 --> 03:26:47,500
Okay.

3462
03:26:47,920 --> 03:26:48,100
Okay.

3463
03:26:49,580 --> 03:26:54,240
Dispel magic, cast red, seven.

3464
03:26:56,320 --> 03:26:58,420
Oh, we had barely just enough.

3465
03:26:59,240 --> 03:27:00,800
Amayoshi, how many shiny days?

3466
03:27:10,630 --> 03:27:12,030
Emerald effigy.

3467
03:27:35,660 --> 03:27:36,260
Oh!

3468
03:27:36,260 --> 03:27:36,860
Gosh!

3469
03:27:45,030 --> 03:27:45,990
Are they dead?

3470
03:27:50,430 --> 03:27:51,650
I think they're dead.

3471
03:27:55,680 --> 03:27:56,760
I think we're good.

3472
03:28:01,160 --> 03:28:02,600
Please, I need to...there we go.

3473
03:28:03,960 --> 03:28:05,960
Why won't it stop being drippy?

3474
03:28:05,960 --> 03:28:07,940
Do I go down here?

3475
03:28:08,240 --> 03:28:09,880
No, we don't want to follow the worms.

3476
03:28:10,300 --> 03:28:10,800
You know what?

3477
03:28:10,820 --> 03:28:11,180
Good idea.

3478
03:28:11,640 --> 03:28:12,180
Let's just go.

3479
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:14,560
Let's just get out of here.

3480
03:28:14,620 --> 03:28:15,820
What am I supposed to do with these things?

3481
03:28:16,880 --> 03:28:18,120
Was there any...

3482
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:27,080
So now I have three effigies.

3483
03:28:28,180 --> 03:28:30,080
I'm supposed to put them somewhere, probably.

3484
03:28:31,500 --> 03:28:33,720
I'm trying to think of where I'm going to put them.

3485
03:28:35,980 --> 03:28:38,900
You guys, we all have a little bit of worm inside us, okay?

3486
03:28:39,080 --> 03:28:41,700
We all got a little bit of worms inside us, it's no big deal.

3487
03:28:42,680 --> 03:28:44,820
It's NBD, no big deal.

3488
03:28:46,940 --> 03:28:47,780
No biggie.

3489
03:28:53,600 --> 03:28:55,700
Is this the room that I hate the most?

3490
03:28:57,100 --> 03:29:00,120
I'm not even...okay, I'm going to use my trusty axe, you guys.

3491
03:29:02,320 --> 03:29:03,740
Oh, this isn't the room.

3492
03:29:03,920 --> 03:29:04,360
Not yet.

3493
03:29:06,540 --> 03:29:08,020
Do brain worms count?

3494
03:29:08,140 --> 03:29:08,560
Absolutely.

3495
03:29:12,940 --> 03:29:13,780
What the?

3496
03:29:14,400 --> 03:29:16,520
Where did the little guys come from?

3497
03:29:21,220 --> 03:29:22,060
Oh my gosh.

3498
03:29:24,220 --> 03:29:25,000
They're coming.

3499
03:29:25,360 --> 03:29:26,660
They're coming and I'm scared.

3500
03:29:27,220 --> 03:29:28,060
Remember your magic.

3501
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:14,040
Heart.

3502
03:30:14,660 --> 03:30:14,680
Heart.

3503
03:30:14,700 --> 03:30:14,720
Heart.

3504
03:30:14,720 --> 03:30:15,700
I hate these guys.

3505
03:30:15,780 --> 03:30:17,440
Why do they have to give me two of them?

3506
03:30:20,060 --> 03:30:22,320
Gosh, it must require a lot of magical.

3507
03:30:25,500 --> 03:30:25,960
Cinema.

3508
03:30:28,420 --> 03:30:30,540
Wait, my magic is full.

3509
03:30:50,070 --> 03:30:50,710
Wait, what?

3510
03:30:52,870 --> 03:30:54,750
Wait, now it's all the way gone.

3511
03:30:55,370 --> 03:30:55,650
What?

3512
03:30:58,450 --> 03:31:00,210
He's not magical enough.

3513
03:31:01,870 --> 03:31:04,050
He's just a small magic guy.

3514
03:31:05,030 --> 03:31:09,710
Oh, so he's got like bigger sanity and other stats...

3515
03:31:09,710 --> 03:31:13,630
but he can't do level 7, some level 7 spells.

3516
03:31:13,850 --> 03:31:14,750
Oh my gosh.

3517
03:31:15,330 --> 03:31:17,050
Oh my gosh, no.

3518
03:31:17,390 --> 03:31:18,150
Mike, no!

3519
03:31:22,610 --> 03:31:23,950
Okay, alright.

3520
03:31:25,650 --> 03:31:27,510
I just have to run through, maybe.

3521
03:31:28,330 --> 03:31:29,910
But where do I go with this?

3522
03:31:29,970 --> 03:31:30,590
Okay, hold on.

3523
03:31:35,290 --> 03:31:36,590
What do I do with these?

3524
03:31:38,230 --> 03:31:43,550
A small statue of a scholar ravaged by an unseen foe is made...

3525
03:31:50,490 --> 03:31:52,430
Is that why he's on his knees?

3526
03:31:58,890 --> 03:31:59,450
No!

3527
03:32:01,170 --> 03:32:01,730
Scholar!

3528
03:32:06,350 --> 03:32:06,910
Scholar!

3529
03:32:08,490 --> 03:32:09,050
No!

3530
03:32:09,430 --> 03:32:10,150
What about this one?

3531
03:32:14,970 --> 03:32:21,370
A small statuette of a sorcerer driven mad by an unseen force is made from a lustrous sapphire.

3532
03:32:22,110 --> 03:32:22,970
What about this one?

3533
03:32:23,450 --> 03:32:29,370
A small statuette of a defeated warrior kneeling in respect to an unseen victor is made from a deep red ruby.

3534
03:32:36,560 --> 03:32:38,500
You opened a way through the lights puzzle.

3535
03:32:42,050 --> 03:32:43,110
What was down there?

3536
03:32:43,270 --> 03:32:44,690
Oh, I'm really losing it, aren't I?

3537
03:32:44,870 --> 03:32:47,110
Okay, I'm just gonna run past these guys once again.

3538
03:32:50,910 --> 03:32:53,170
Why do they keep doing this to me?

3539
03:33:03,020 --> 03:33:04,500
Oh my gosh.

3540
03:33:04,620 --> 03:33:08,560
I like how the sim symbol is just getting stuck on the wall.

3541
03:33:08,560 --> 03:33:08,900
Wait.

3542
03:33:09,180 --> 03:33:09,960
Okay, it's not gone.

3543
03:33:14,280 --> 03:33:14,660
Okay.

3544
03:33:14,660 --> 03:33:16,220
Let's go back through here.

3545
03:33:21,460 --> 03:33:22,120
Climb down.

3546
03:33:24,040 --> 03:33:25,520
Oh, did I not go through here?

3547
03:33:25,640 --> 03:33:26,140
Am I stupid?

3548
03:33:31,680 --> 03:33:32,260
Oh my god.

3549
03:33:32,520 --> 03:33:33,140
No, no, no, no, no.

3550
03:33:38,290 --> 03:33:39,450
Oh, that's right.

3551
03:33:39,590 --> 03:33:40,670
I went down here.

3552
03:33:41,490 --> 03:33:43,390
And it turned into the tome.

3553
03:33:43,490 --> 03:33:44,750
That's why I completely forgot.

3554
03:33:47,190 --> 03:33:48,150
That's right, that's right.

3555
03:33:48,190 --> 03:33:48,930
I was like, wait a sec.

3556
03:33:51,270 --> 03:33:51,990
That's right.

3557
03:33:53,650 --> 03:33:54,510
Oh my gosh.

3558
03:34:05,500 --> 03:34:10,640
That's fine though, because we needed to go get the other effigy, so it's fine.

3559
03:34:11,460 --> 03:34:16,000
On your channel, when you started this playthrough, I had a blast watching you play and love this game.

3560
03:34:16,120 --> 03:34:16,880
Count me in as a new fan of yours.

3561
03:34:17,500 --> 03:34:18,640
Nevermore, thank you!

3562
03:34:18,800 --> 03:34:19,500
Oh my gosh!

3563
03:34:21,600 --> 03:34:23,700
Thank you so much, and thanks for sticking around.

3564
03:34:23,880 --> 03:34:25,860
Thanks for the superchat, I really appreciate it.

3565
03:34:26,420 --> 03:34:27,700
Welcome, welcome, yeah.

3566
03:34:28,180 --> 03:34:28,880
Oh gosh.

3567
03:34:29,300 --> 03:34:31,820
You've seen me at my best and my worst, eh?

3568
03:34:32,700 --> 03:34:33,720
Alright, let's go up.

3569
03:34:36,560 --> 03:34:37,340
Let's go down.

3570
03:34:43,160 --> 03:34:44,280
Let's cast.

3571
03:34:44,400 --> 03:34:46,580
I cast, enchant item cast.

3572
03:34:47,100 --> 03:34:48,620
Wait, I can do seven.

3573
03:34:49,160 --> 03:34:50,960
I cast on gun.

3574
03:35:00,950 --> 03:35:02,970
This item is now enchanted.

3575
03:35:04,730 --> 03:35:07,090
We don't have...

3576
03:35:09,550 --> 03:35:10,110
Our...

3577
03:35:10,110 --> 03:35:11,570
Oh, it didn't last very long.

3578
03:35:11,790 --> 03:35:13,090
That's okay, we should be fine.

3579
03:35:14,230 --> 03:35:14,650
I say.

3580
03:35:22,010 --> 03:35:22,490
Oh gosh.

3581
03:35:25,550 --> 03:35:26,590
That was so close.

3582
03:35:37,300 --> 03:35:39,020
This might be the best weapon in the game.

3583
03:35:39,340 --> 03:35:40,480
Wait, let's go finish this guy.

3584
03:35:40,840 --> 03:35:41,240
No, no.

3585
03:35:42,880 --> 03:35:43,900
Okay, let's finish him.

3586
03:35:45,580 --> 03:35:47,240
Give me the sanity boost, baby.

3587
03:35:49,960 --> 03:35:50,840
Nice, nice.

3588
03:35:52,960 --> 03:35:54,540
This room looks clean.

3589
03:35:55,680 --> 03:35:57,860
This room is like the cleanest room we've seen.

3590
03:35:57,860 --> 03:36:01,800
Why are all the lights on?

3591
03:36:02,180 --> 03:36:03,560
How is the fire burning?

3592
03:36:05,900 --> 03:36:08,600
Before we go down, I will save once again.

3593
03:36:09,440 --> 03:36:11,720
I am a save scummer in this game.

3594
03:36:11,960 --> 03:36:13,020
I cast gun.

3595
03:36:17,960 --> 03:36:20,500
Can't wait to see him give the book to grandpa.

3596
03:36:20,880 --> 03:36:23,660
Or not the book, but the thing to grandpa in Rhode Island.

3597
03:36:26,060 --> 03:36:26,660
Okay.

3598
03:36:27,540 --> 03:36:28,480
Who's here?

3599
03:36:29,400 --> 03:36:30,880
No room is safe in this game.

3600
03:36:31,460 --> 03:36:32,320
Who's here?

3601
03:36:33,180 --> 03:36:34,100
Camera angle, please.

3602
03:36:35,980 --> 03:36:36,580
Okay.

3603
03:36:37,340 --> 03:36:38,160
Maybe we're fine.

3604
03:36:38,800 --> 03:36:39,320
Ish.

3605
03:36:39,640 --> 03:36:40,300
I say fine.

3606
03:36:40,420 --> 03:36:41,220
Maybe we're fine.

3607
03:36:41,380 --> 03:36:42,940
Oh, there's a ladder here.

3608
03:36:44,880 --> 03:36:46,660
And there's a...

3609
03:36:49,560 --> 03:36:51,160
Let's also go down here.

3610
03:36:53,920 --> 03:36:54,320
Let's...

3611
03:36:54,320 --> 03:36:55,520
Oh, wow.

3612
03:36:55,900 --> 03:36:56,500
There's way more.

3613
03:36:56,680 --> 03:36:58,640
Okay, and there's another ladder over here.

3614
03:36:58,940 --> 03:36:59,260
Okay.

3615
03:36:59,740 --> 03:37:00,140
Alright.

3616
03:37:00,640 --> 03:37:02,200
Let's go to the first one.

3617
03:37:04,420 --> 03:37:05,760
Let's check it out.

3618
03:37:13,570 --> 03:37:14,290
Get his face.

3619
03:37:14,370 --> 03:37:14,710
Get his face.

3620
03:37:14,750 --> 03:37:15,110
Get his face.

3621
03:37:15,170 --> 03:37:15,530
Get his face.

3622
03:37:16,030 --> 03:37:16,710
Get his face.

3623
03:37:16,830 --> 03:37:17,090
Get his face.

3624
03:37:17,590 --> 03:37:18,410
No, that's arm.

3625
03:37:18,790 --> 03:37:19,510
Get his face.

3626
03:37:20,070 --> 03:37:20,770
Get his face.

3627
03:37:20,770 --> 03:37:20,850
Get his face.

3628
03:37:23,930 --> 03:37:24,450
Reload.

3629
03:37:24,570 --> 03:37:26,110
Did that guy just fall down?

3630
03:37:27,490 --> 03:37:28,130
Oh my god, please.

3631
03:37:33,520 --> 03:37:34,780
There we go.

3632
03:37:35,020 --> 03:37:35,280
Alright.

3633
03:37:37,460 --> 03:37:38,660
He got tired.

3634
03:37:42,550 --> 03:37:45,010
He was like, I can't handle this anymore.

3635
03:37:46,090 --> 03:37:48,110
He's like, I literally can't.

3636
03:37:53,120 --> 03:37:54,220
Yeah, take that.

3637
03:37:55,740 --> 03:37:56,360
Take that.

3638
03:37:56,520 --> 03:37:56,760
Take that.

3639
03:37:56,860 --> 03:37:57,280
Take that.

3640
03:37:58,760 --> 03:37:59,560
And finish him.

3641
03:37:59,900 --> 03:38:00,200
Oh, no.

3642
03:38:00,400 --> 03:38:01,240
He's not done yet.

3643
03:38:01,940 --> 03:38:02,520
Oh, shoot.

3644
03:38:03,300 --> 03:38:04,080
Yeah, no head.

3645
03:38:04,940 --> 03:38:05,740
No head.

3646
03:38:07,060 --> 03:38:07,680
Take that.

3647
03:38:07,760 --> 03:38:08,100
Take that.

3648
03:38:08,320 --> 03:38:09,360
And finish...

3649
03:38:11,340 --> 03:38:12,120
Take that.

3650
03:38:12,320 --> 03:38:12,640
Take that.

3651
03:38:12,760 --> 03:38:13,080
Take that.

3652
03:38:15,090 --> 03:38:16,190
Can I finish him yet?

3653
03:38:17,090 --> 03:38:18,210
Why are you so strong?

3654
03:38:18,910 --> 03:38:19,590
Oh, there we go.

3655
03:38:22,090 --> 03:38:22,410
Woo!

3656
03:38:26,470 --> 03:38:28,150
And yet the walls continue bleeding.

3657
03:38:28,410 --> 03:38:30,330
I love that there is friendly fire in this game.

3658
03:38:30,450 --> 03:38:31,490
It might be my favorite part.

3659
03:38:31,730 --> 03:38:34,310
Well, not when I shoot the maids on accident, but you know what I mean.

3660
03:38:34,790 --> 03:38:36,150
Angel, thank you for the gift.

3661
03:38:36,210 --> 03:38:36,990
Thank you so much.

3662
03:38:39,930 --> 03:38:41,250
We came up from there.

3663
03:38:41,890 --> 03:38:42,930
Is there... Is this a way?

3664
03:38:43,050 --> 03:38:43,190
No.

3665
03:38:43,470 --> 03:38:44,830
Okay, so we are going down.

3666
03:38:45,910 --> 03:38:47,250
We come up just to go down.

3667
03:38:51,390 --> 03:38:52,470
Holy cow.

3668
03:38:54,130 --> 03:38:55,190
Take that.

3669
03:38:55,510 --> 03:38:55,770
Take that.

3670
03:38:58,190 --> 03:38:59,570
I can't see.

3671
03:39:00,010 --> 03:39:00,410
Can you?

3672
03:39:03,690 --> 03:39:04,330
Yeah.

3673
03:39:04,750 --> 03:39:06,170
Oh no, please.

3674
03:39:06,650 --> 03:39:07,650
Please, no, please.

3675
03:39:08,070 --> 03:39:09,310
Please, stay away from me.

3676
03:39:09,790 --> 03:39:11,210
Stay away from me, please.

3677
03:39:28,900 --> 03:39:30,460
Oh, he's right there.

3678
03:39:30,800 --> 03:39:32,440
Oh gosh, he's right there.

3679
03:39:37,700 --> 03:39:38,700
It's blue!

3680
03:39:43,060 --> 03:39:45,540
I got the wrong thing.

3681
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:50,360
Oh my god.

3682
03:39:56,020 --> 03:39:57,160
Go away.

3683
03:39:58,860 --> 03:40:00,020
I cast run away.

3684
03:40:02,000 --> 03:40:03,920
Why is he still stealing green then?

3685
03:40:04,660 --> 03:40:05,760
If he is a blue guy.

3686
03:40:06,160 --> 03:40:06,660
Oh my gosh.

3687
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:08,700
I'm gonna try the pistol.

3688
03:40:08,880 --> 03:40:09,280
I'm sorry.

3689
03:40:09,440 --> 03:40:11,160
I know... Actually no.

3690
03:40:11,360 --> 03:40:14,420
While this is enchanted, I should at least try.

3691
03:40:20,960 --> 03:40:21,760
Finish him!

3692
03:40:22,000 --> 03:40:22,780
Finish him, please.

3693
03:40:22,880 --> 03:40:23,300
Take him down.

3694
03:40:23,440 --> 03:40:25,480
I don't want to see his stupid nasty face anymore.

3695
03:40:26,900 --> 03:40:27,740
What about this guy?

3696
03:40:29,320 --> 03:40:31,620
He's over here whacking it by himself.

3697
03:40:33,820 --> 03:40:34,540
Hey guy.

3698
03:40:36,220 --> 03:40:37,480
You got no head.

3699
03:40:43,430 --> 03:40:45,390
He's like whacking his arms around you guys.

3700
03:40:50,130 --> 03:40:51,430
What did she mean by that?

3701
03:40:51,470 --> 03:40:52,010
What do you mean?

3702
03:40:54,790 --> 03:40:55,910
He's like...

3703
03:40:55,910 --> 03:40:56,530
You know?

3704
03:40:59,390 --> 03:41:02,330
Let's save since I just defeated that thing.

3705
03:41:03,110 --> 03:41:05,170
I'm gonna actually save over Roberto.

3706
03:41:05,290 --> 03:41:06,330
I'm sick of seeing his face.

3707
03:41:08,590 --> 03:41:10,430
Sick of seeing Roberto's face.

3708
03:41:12,250 --> 03:41:13,630
Oh my god.

3709
03:41:15,130 --> 03:41:16,030
Pistol time.

3710
03:41:23,850 --> 03:41:25,150
Isn't he gonna explode?

3711
03:41:25,230 --> 03:41:25,610
Don't explode.

3712
03:41:27,490 --> 03:41:28,450
And... you too.

3713
03:41:30,570 --> 03:41:31,150
Nice.

3714
03:41:34,250 --> 03:41:35,450
She hates Roberto.

3715
03:41:36,650 --> 03:41:38,910
If your name is Roberto and you are in the chat... I'm sorry.

3716
03:41:40,650 --> 03:41:41,510
Is this a door?

3717
03:41:44,310 --> 03:41:46,010
Anything can be a door if I...

3718
03:41:47,250 --> 03:41:49,150
If I knock hard enough.

3719
03:41:51,510 --> 03:41:52,150
Oh wait.

3720
03:41:52,330 --> 03:41:53,030
This is a door.

3721
03:41:54,370 --> 03:41:55,410
Is this not a door?

3722
03:41:56,150 --> 03:41:57,450
It must be a door later.

3723
03:41:58,250 --> 03:42:00,050
This is where... Oh my gosh.

3724
03:42:00,070 --> 03:42:00,610
I remember.

3725
03:42:00,730 --> 03:42:03,910
This is where we let our little skilly friend die.

3726
03:42:04,370 --> 03:42:05,050
Hi ghost lady.

3727
03:42:05,190 --> 03:42:06,230
Hi Squidward.

3728
03:42:06,230 --> 03:42:06,390
Squidward.

3729
03:42:10,230 --> 03:42:12,930
No head and whacking it by yourself.

3730
03:42:13,090 --> 03:42:14,490
Should I sue for my likeness?

3731
03:42:15,790 --> 03:42:16,530
Are you a zombie?

3732
03:42:23,850 --> 03:42:24,330
Gosh.

3733
03:42:24,550 --> 03:42:25,550
Don't get... Oh my god.

3734
03:42:26,170 --> 03:42:29,990
Don't get... Don't get... Don't get...

3735
03:42:30,670 --> 03:42:32,450
Don't get... Don't get surrounded now.

3736
03:42:32,990 --> 03:42:33,970
Don't get cornered.

3737
03:42:34,090 --> 03:42:34,990
Alright, now we can finish him.

3738
03:42:35,650 --> 03:42:36,250
Yeah!

3739
03:42:36,390 --> 03:42:37,210
Number one!

3740
03:42:38,290 --> 03:42:39,370
Number two!

3741
03:42:41,010 --> 03:42:42,210
Number three!

3742
03:42:44,770 --> 03:42:45,970
Number four!

3743
03:42:46,170 --> 03:42:46,490
Cinema.

3744
03:42:48,170 --> 03:42:50,190
Roberto was my name in Spanish class?

3745
03:42:50,490 --> 03:42:52,690
Were you one of those teachers that made you pick a name?

3746
03:42:53,310 --> 03:42:54,010
Oh big guy.

3747
03:42:54,290 --> 03:42:55,370
Big guy incoming.

3748
03:42:56,610 --> 03:42:58,370
He's like whoa, whoa, whoa.

3749
03:43:07,950 --> 03:43:08,490
Aww.

3750
03:43:10,030 --> 03:43:11,870
You don't like my axe?

3751
03:43:12,130 --> 03:43:14,050
I feel like the guy from... What's it called?

3752
03:43:16,130 --> 03:43:17,710
From Lord of the Rings.

3753
03:43:17,930 --> 03:43:19,690
And my axe.

3754
03:43:21,530 --> 03:43:21,790
Oh.

3755
03:43:22,530 --> 03:43:25,690
A strange obelisk made from a dark granite-like material.

3756
03:43:25,890 --> 03:43:30,910
It appears to be blocking the way forward, but the obelisk appears to be impervious to all damage.

3757
03:43:32,190 --> 03:43:32,830
A Gimli.

3758
03:43:32,830 --> 03:43:38,430
What one's that?

3759
03:43:53,220 --> 03:43:53,900
Spell.

3760
03:43:55,180 --> 03:43:57,180
So it was a triangle.

3761
03:44:01,040 --> 03:44:02,400
Wait, let me see my runes.

3762
03:44:06,280 --> 03:44:07,600
It was this one.

3763
03:44:10,280 --> 03:44:12,540
Do we gotta be a little trapper?

3764
03:44:12,540 --> 03:44:14,820
Can I go in there?

3765
03:44:14,920 --> 03:44:15,300
Can I fit?

3766
03:44:18,400 --> 03:44:19,920
Can the trapper fit in there?

3767
03:44:26,180 --> 03:44:27,280
Summon trapper.

3768
03:44:28,220 --> 03:44:28,840
I cast.

3769
03:44:31,800 --> 03:44:32,440
Bye!

3770
03:44:47,720 --> 03:44:48,420
Oh, goodbye.

3771
03:44:50,020 --> 03:44:52,720
RIP little guy, he did his job so well.

3772
03:44:53,300 --> 03:44:55,240
07 little guy, 07.

3773
03:44:56,380 --> 03:44:57,200
Okay, nice.

3774
03:44:58,340 --> 03:45:01,840
Well, let's go through this door first since I didn't check in here.

3775
03:45:05,280 --> 03:45:06,900
Let's find zomboes.

3776
03:45:07,200 --> 03:45:09,400
I can handle... oh, depth perception.

3777
03:45:11,100 --> 03:45:11,420
Okay.

3778
03:45:16,010 --> 03:45:18,270
Can I handle this actually?

3779
03:45:18,630 --> 03:45:19,130
I don't know.

3780
03:45:20,410 --> 03:45:21,190
Oh my god!

3781
03:45:21,710 --> 03:45:23,510
Oh my god!

3782
03:45:26,030 --> 03:45:26,650
Finish him.

3783
03:45:26,810 --> 03:45:27,810
Oh, I could have finished him.

3784
03:45:29,630 --> 03:45:30,030
Damn.

3785
03:45:31,910 --> 03:45:33,930
I've never seen him hug me like that before.

3786
03:45:36,170 --> 03:45:38,190
I've never seen him hug me like that before.

3787
03:45:41,930 --> 03:45:42,950
Oh my gosh.

3788
03:45:43,530 --> 03:45:44,250
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3789
03:45:47,550 --> 03:45:48,970
The music even changed.

3790
03:45:49,410 --> 03:45:49,750
What the?

3791
03:45:50,330 --> 03:45:51,590
There's a guy stuck in the ground?

3792
03:45:53,830 --> 03:45:54,670
He's gone.

3793
03:45:54,830 --> 03:45:55,490
It's fine.

3794
03:45:58,250 --> 03:45:59,970
Let's recover some sanity.

3795
03:46:02,350 --> 03:46:02,830
Sanity!

3796
03:46:02,830 --> 03:46:06,150
Actually, let's leave it down a little bit so we can see some funny things happen.

3797
03:46:09,370 --> 03:46:10,270
Who's this?

3798
03:46:12,330 --> 03:46:13,290
A warrior!

3799
03:46:13,910 --> 03:46:16,250
The image is very strong, dominating this part of the room.

3800
03:46:16,930 --> 03:46:20,110
Below the design, a small ledge protrudes from the wall as if awaiting...

3801
03:46:21,710 --> 03:46:26,450
Awaiting something such as a ruby effigy.

3802
03:46:55,270 --> 03:46:57,970
Oh, we are in so bad shape, guys.

3803
03:46:58,990 --> 03:47:00,270
We are in really bad shape.

3804
03:47:00,390 --> 03:47:00,950
Oh, please move.

3805
03:47:01,450 --> 03:47:02,370
Oh my god, please move.

3806
03:47:03,130 --> 03:47:04,510
We are in real bad shape.

3807
03:47:06,050 --> 03:47:06,930
Oh, okay, good.

3808
03:47:09,070 --> 03:47:09,790
Holy moly!

3809
03:47:11,850 --> 03:47:13,110
Okay, I get the babies.

3810
03:47:13,190 --> 03:47:13,890
I get the babies.

3811
03:47:13,970 --> 03:47:14,670
I get the babies.

3812
03:47:16,330 --> 03:47:17,830
You guys, we have the babies again.

3813
03:47:18,090 --> 03:47:18,850
The babies are back!

3814
03:47:27,210 --> 03:47:28,070
Oh, let's... No!

3815
03:47:30,450 --> 03:47:30,810
Oopsie.

3816
03:47:30,810 --> 03:47:34,850
Do I Pokemon them here, maybe?

3817
03:47:35,490 --> 03:47:36,970
Because it didn't let me do that.

3818
03:47:37,090 --> 03:47:38,790
So let's Pokemon them here.

3819
03:47:39,770 --> 03:47:41,810
Red, he awaits...

3820
03:47:45,790 --> 03:47:50,650
Okay, this one is... Oh, the babies are gone.

3821
03:47:51,430 --> 03:47:54,170
This is a female scholar.

3822
03:47:54,890 --> 03:47:57,590
Her authoritative glare dominates this part of the room.

3823
03:47:57,990 --> 03:47:59,450
Below the design, a small ledge protrudes.

3824
03:47:59,450 --> 03:47:59,690
Okay.

3825
03:48:00,490 --> 03:48:00,890
Wow.

3826
03:48:04,350 --> 03:48:05,430
We are smart.

3827
03:48:05,830 --> 03:48:07,450
So green is...

3828
03:48:12,660 --> 03:48:13,540
Green is blue.

3829
03:48:16,280 --> 03:48:16,520
Yeah.

3830
03:48:18,520 --> 03:48:19,500
Oh, gosh.

3831
03:48:21,080 --> 03:48:23,580
For some reason my brain was really telling me otherwise.

3832
03:48:24,040 --> 03:48:25,360
But I was like, no, that's the case.

3833
03:48:26,520 --> 03:48:28,720
A sorcerer casting a spell.

3834
03:48:28,900 --> 03:48:32,900
There is an air of authority about him, conveyed by his dominating visage.

3835
03:48:33,320 --> 03:48:35,360
Below the design...

3836
03:48:55,210 --> 03:48:56,570
Hidden staircase!

3837
03:48:56,570 --> 03:48:56,830
Okay.

3838
03:48:58,690 --> 03:48:58,990
Wow.

3839
03:48:59,110 --> 03:49:00,850
Okay, we got a lot to explore real quick though.

3840
03:49:03,430 --> 03:49:05,230
We got a lot to explore first.

3841
03:49:05,370 --> 03:49:08,230
We've got the trapper area that we unlocked.

3842
03:49:09,650 --> 03:49:12,790
He looks so badass walking towards the door with a gun.

3843
03:49:13,750 --> 03:49:14,990
He looks so awesome.

3844
03:49:15,510 --> 03:49:17,570
How much... Oh, let's...

3845
03:49:22,310 --> 03:49:23,730
He is so cool.

3846
03:49:24,050 --> 03:49:25,030
Yeah, he is pretty cool.

3847
03:49:27,990 --> 03:49:29,590
So, back in this room.

3848
03:49:29,710 --> 03:49:31,050
But let's not go there just yet.

3849
03:49:32,130 --> 03:49:34,130
First, let's save.

3850
03:49:38,910 --> 03:49:39,430
Alright.

3851
03:49:40,070 --> 03:49:40,430
Down.

3852
03:49:40,710 --> 03:49:41,690
Down, down we go.

3853
03:49:43,870 --> 03:49:46,090
That sounded like...

3854
03:49:47,550 --> 03:49:49,210
Either a zombie or a trapper.

3855
03:49:52,250 --> 03:49:56,370
I wish it was an easier way to switch weapons.

3856
03:50:01,770 --> 03:50:04,050
So that I didn't have to always go into the menu.

3857
03:50:05,290 --> 03:50:07,490
It's my small complaint, you know.

3858
03:50:09,190 --> 03:50:10,450
It's my small complaint.

3859
03:50:10,550 --> 03:50:11,590
Oh my god, another staircase!

3860
03:50:23,020 --> 03:50:26,720
I remember, this is where we got that one effigy.

3861
03:50:26,800 --> 03:50:27,700
Right here, wasn't it?

3862
03:50:27,740 --> 03:50:28,920
Right there, hidden in the wall.

3863
03:50:30,080 --> 03:50:30,540
I think.

3864
03:50:31,480 --> 03:50:32,360
Or am I crazy?

3865
03:50:32,620 --> 03:50:36,220
Wasn't there a door here that led to like a crazy fight?

3866
03:50:36,500 --> 03:50:37,060
I don't know.

3867
03:50:39,900 --> 03:50:41,600
The statue stairs are missable.

3868
03:50:41,760 --> 03:50:42,300
Wait, seriously?

3869
03:50:43,460 --> 03:50:44,400
Oh, OK.

3870
03:50:44,460 --> 03:50:45,200
Let's go back then.

3871
03:50:47,340 --> 03:50:48,860
I thought those were how you progress.

3872
03:50:50,080 --> 03:50:51,880
I thought those were how you progress.

3873
03:50:52,160 --> 03:50:52,700
Oh my gosh.

3874
03:50:52,920 --> 03:50:53,120
OK.

3875
03:50:58,430 --> 03:50:59,130
Just kidding.

3876
03:50:59,750 --> 03:51:01,030
We are going this way first.

3877
03:51:10,110 --> 03:51:11,510
Oh!

3878
03:51:20,890 --> 03:51:24,310
Any Michaels in the chat?

3879
03:51:29,900 --> 03:51:30,800
OK.

3880
03:51:30,800 --> 03:51:30,880
OK.

3881
03:51:34,120 --> 03:51:36,620
Does it stay enchanted?

3882
03:51:37,940 --> 03:51:40,420
This Gladius carries a powerful enchantment.

3883
03:51:40,580 --> 03:51:44,600
This unique weapon can only be wielded by its destined owner, the Guardian of Light.

3884
03:51:46,800 --> 03:51:47,920
One medal is full of Michaels.

3885
03:51:48,020 --> 03:51:48,500
So true.

3886
03:51:53,130 --> 03:51:55,270
We have plenty of Mike H's.

3887
03:51:56,410 --> 03:51:56,910
I'm seeing.

3888
03:52:00,940 --> 03:52:02,400
Pre-enchanted weapon?

3889
03:52:03,540 --> 03:52:05,360
Wait, why can't I use it?

3890
03:52:08,040 --> 03:52:10,060
I can't equip it for some reason.

3891
03:52:10,520 --> 03:52:12,160
Oh, I'm not the Guardian.

3892
03:52:13,060 --> 03:52:14,840
I'm not the Guardian of Light.

3893
03:52:17,300 --> 03:52:19,060
I'm not the destined hero.

3894
03:52:19,760 --> 03:52:22,060
I thought I was the main character.

3895
03:52:22,980 --> 03:52:24,380
I thought it was me.

3896
03:52:27,440 --> 03:52:27,980
No.

3897
03:52:29,460 --> 03:52:31,860
I thought I was the main character.

3898
03:52:33,600 --> 03:52:37,700
Alright, now let's save one more time before I continue onward since we got that.

3899
03:53:02,130 --> 03:53:03,090
I'll take that.

3900
03:53:04,390 --> 03:53:05,110
Bind!

3901
03:53:15,230 --> 03:53:17,750
I can bind things now.

3902
03:53:22,480 --> 03:53:23,800
You guys, that's it!

3903
03:53:24,140 --> 03:53:27,200
We've gotten every spell in the game!

3904
03:53:28,280 --> 03:53:31,360
We are a Tome of Eternal Darkness master!

3905
03:53:34,460 --> 03:53:35,620
A note is scribbled on the scroll.

3906
03:53:35,760 --> 03:53:40,980
It reads, this magic enables the caster to bind a creature with magic, forcing it to ally with them.

3907
03:53:43,720 --> 03:53:44,200
Huge.

3908
03:53:46,400 --> 03:53:50,120
Oh, I can't go up here.

3909
03:53:52,540 --> 03:53:54,740
Who do I make my friend?

3910
03:53:59,680 --> 03:54:00,160
Okay.

3911
03:54:00,160 --> 03:54:00,620
Okay.

3912
03:54:06,470 --> 03:54:08,670
Can I use it from here?

3913
03:54:09,570 --> 03:54:12,450
Do I have to go through the...

3914
03:54:14,390 --> 03:54:15,230
Wait.

3915
03:54:16,350 --> 03:54:17,910
Let's new spell.

3916
03:54:18,690 --> 03:54:19,370
Wait, what was it?

3917
03:54:21,130 --> 03:54:22,330
Bankorok Aratak.

3918
03:54:22,450 --> 03:54:23,270
Bankorok Aratak.

3919
03:54:23,350 --> 03:54:23,830
Bankorok.

3920
03:54:26,390 --> 03:54:26,850
Bankorok.

3921
03:54:28,410 --> 03:54:29,330
Aratak.

3922
03:54:31,890 --> 03:54:32,330
Parkonparkonparkon.

3923
03:54:43,210 --> 03:54:43,990
Let's go!

3924
03:54:47,010 --> 03:54:49,330
Now for this spell, is it...

3925
03:54:51,950 --> 03:54:53,650
Maybe I should do the 5 star one too.

3926
03:54:55,410 --> 03:54:57,430
Just so I have it, just so I have it.

3927
03:54:58,250 --> 03:54:58,650
Bankorok.

3928
03:54:59,830 --> 03:55:00,230
Aratak.

3929
03:55:01,210 --> 03:55:01,610
Parkonparkon.

3930
03:55:17,420 --> 03:55:18,220
Bind, cast.

3931
03:55:18,980 --> 03:55:20,920
Oh yeah, we might not even be able to do the 7 point.

3932
03:55:21,840 --> 03:55:24,540
So, it would be red then, or is it green?

3933
03:55:24,740 --> 03:55:25,960
Because he's a green guy.

3934
03:55:26,260 --> 03:55:28,820
Or is it red because he's opposite of green?

3935
03:55:35,050 --> 03:55:35,770
Is it red?

3936
03:55:36,470 --> 03:55:39,370
I'm trusting Pokemon rules, okay?

3937
03:55:55,400 --> 03:55:56,840
Let's see, my friend.

3938
03:56:05,680 --> 03:56:07,960
Was it not strong enough?

3939
03:56:08,040 --> 03:56:08,300
Maybe.

3940
03:56:12,780 --> 03:56:13,560
Okay, hold on.

3941
03:56:13,620 --> 03:56:15,340
I have to run around and regain my...

3942
03:56:20,480 --> 03:56:22,380
It makes sense that it has to be 7.

3943
03:56:22,620 --> 03:56:25,340
I wasn't sure if we could even cast a 7, so...

3944
03:56:26,220 --> 03:56:28,680
It makes sense, it makes sense.

3945
03:56:37,520 --> 03:56:38,360
7.

3946
03:56:39,620 --> 03:56:42,760
Horror is a 7 point, so...

3947
03:56:42,760 --> 03:56:43,320
Alright, let's see.

3948
03:56:53,700 --> 03:56:55,900
Fight my friends!

3949
03:56:58,100 --> 03:56:58,620
Yeah!

3950
03:56:58,620 --> 03:56:59,880
Fight my friend!

3951
03:57:00,320 --> 03:57:01,000
You can win!

3952
03:57:01,060 --> 03:57:01,980
You can win this!

3953
03:57:02,380 --> 03:57:02,680
Yeah!

3954
03:57:02,900 --> 03:57:03,440
Take him down!

3955
03:57:03,520 --> 03:57:04,040
Take him down!

3956
03:57:04,420 --> 03:57:05,620
Kaiju fight real!

3957
03:57:06,780 --> 03:57:09,420
Oh my god, now I don't have to summon the kaiju anymore.

3958
03:57:09,520 --> 03:57:11,100
I can just possess him.

3959
03:57:15,980 --> 03:57:20,740
Oh, why did my guy have to die?

3960
03:57:20,980 --> 03:57:23,120
Why did I have to possess the weak one?

3961
03:57:23,220 --> 03:57:23,540
No!

3962
03:57:38,990 --> 03:57:39,340
Anyway...

3963
03:57:41,430 --> 03:57:43,110
Rest easy friend.

3964
03:57:43,670 --> 03:57:44,450
Not you.

3965
03:57:44,910 --> 03:57:45,470
You suck.

3966
03:57:47,810 --> 03:57:50,550
You possess the one with the inferior genes.

3967
03:57:52,490 --> 03:57:54,710
It always happens that way, doesn't it?

3968
03:57:55,070 --> 03:57:55,550
What's this?

3969
03:57:56,090 --> 03:57:57,450
A block of explosives?

3970
03:57:57,910 --> 03:57:59,550
Probably a leftover from the war.

3971
03:58:02,670 --> 03:58:03,810
C4!

3972
03:58:04,790 --> 03:58:05,790
C3?

3973
03:58:06,250 --> 03:58:06,810
C3!

3974
03:58:13,510 --> 03:58:15,790
C number.

3975
03:58:18,050 --> 03:58:20,150
Destroy this.

3976
03:58:21,830 --> 03:58:24,370
Wait, there is some ruins down here on the ground.

3977
03:58:26,470 --> 03:58:28,330
What was in this room?

3978
03:58:28,390 --> 03:58:29,270
I can't quite remember.

3979
03:58:30,110 --> 03:58:32,590
How do I get to this?

3980
03:58:33,850 --> 03:58:36,210
Why am I listening to the scary voice?

3981
03:58:37,310 --> 03:58:39,010
Why am I listening to that?

3982
03:58:42,650 --> 03:58:44,050
Destroy this.

3983
03:58:44,490 --> 03:58:45,470
What's this?

3984
03:59:02,020 --> 03:59:04,500
I don't remember how to get there.

3985
03:59:06,740 --> 03:59:09,300
We came through that door.

3986
03:59:12,320 --> 03:59:14,520
This door, for some reason, doesn't open.

3987
03:59:26,700 --> 03:59:29,620
What was... There is no door here.

3988
03:59:32,520 --> 03:59:34,760
Ok, this was the mantle room.

3989
03:59:37,800 --> 03:59:44,500
This seems to be a one-use explosive, so it's not like I can blow up another door to make way for the path.

3990
03:59:44,500 --> 03:59:46,520
Like that, you know.

3991
03:59:47,240 --> 03:59:49,380
Let's go back down here and see if there is anything else.

3992
03:59:49,980 --> 03:59:51,260
Remember Roberto's chapter?

3993
03:59:52,200 --> 03:59:54,260
Guys, that was so long ago.

3994
03:59:55,220 --> 03:59:58,500
I don't remember where it's at at all.

3995
04:00:01,220 --> 04:00:03,500
Yeah, this is...

3996
04:00:04,200 --> 04:00:06,460
We got something in that room, I do remember.

3997
04:00:07,960 --> 04:00:09,400
Oh, that's the door.

3998
04:00:14,580 --> 04:00:16,460
Aren't all explosives one-use?

3999
04:00:17,300 --> 04:00:18,780
You know what I mean.

4000
04:00:18,980 --> 04:00:22,820
We only have enough for one explosion, that's what I mean.

4001
04:00:23,280 --> 04:00:25,440
That's what I mean.

4002
04:00:33,080 --> 04:00:34,760
Multi-use explosive.

4003
04:00:36,520 --> 04:00:37,040
Pink.

4004
04:00:38,320 --> 04:00:38,840
Where?

4005
04:00:50,010 --> 04:00:55,310
Like, I remember being in that room and the worms.

4006
04:00:56,550 --> 04:00:58,450
And we had to lower the bridge.

4007
04:00:58,570 --> 04:01:00,510
I remember what we had to do in there.

4008
04:01:01,170 --> 04:01:03,250
I just don't remember how we got to there.

4009
04:01:07,110 --> 04:01:10,030
Now I just feel like I'm backtracking, but...

4010
04:01:10,030 --> 04:01:14,630
I mean, I am, but I can't tell when I've backtracked too far.

4011
04:01:14,950 --> 04:01:16,050
Too close to the sun.

4012
04:01:17,210 --> 04:01:17,590
Pink.

4013
04:01:21,580 --> 04:01:25,360
I don't think the map is going to be any use, but...

4014
04:01:32,980 --> 04:01:34,660
You must find the P floor.

4015
04:01:47,240 --> 04:01:49,760
Wasn't there a door in that room with the trapper plinth?

4016
04:01:54,960 --> 04:01:56,260
The P floor.

4017
04:01:57,600 --> 04:01:59,140
Where was the P floor?

4018
04:02:10,440 --> 04:02:12,260
You would think I would remember that.

4019
04:02:14,560 --> 04:02:17,420
Yeah, I know I have a map, but it doesn't really help.

4020
04:02:20,300 --> 04:02:20,980
Is it?

4021
04:02:21,320 --> 04:02:23,480
They all look the same.

4022
04:02:26,380 --> 04:02:32,100
I don't even know where I'm at right now.

4023
04:02:33,860 --> 04:02:38,620
That's where we just got the explosives, right?

4024
04:02:42,100 --> 04:02:43,660
And then...

4025
04:02:43,660 --> 04:02:46,560
If you can't find it, make it!

4026
04:02:51,830 --> 04:02:54,190
Definitely back in the room you summon the trapper.

4027
04:02:58,630 --> 04:03:00,030
I'll go back.

4028
04:03:01,410 --> 04:03:02,690
P floor.

4029
04:03:09,830 --> 04:03:11,410
Wait, where did I summon the trapper?

4030
04:03:26,760 --> 04:03:28,700
Let's just go back a little bit, guys.

4031
04:03:28,800 --> 04:03:30,100
Sorry, I'm so lost.

4032
04:03:32,840 --> 04:03:33,940
I'm feeling...oh wait!

4033
04:03:36,360 --> 04:03:37,100
Oh, ok.

4034
04:03:37,280 --> 04:03:38,920
That's where the worms...

4035
04:03:46,100 --> 04:03:48,740
We haven't gone...

4036
04:03:48,740 --> 04:03:53,120
Do we go down this way?

4037
04:03:55,100 --> 04:03:56,440
I'm so lost.

4038
04:03:58,300 --> 04:03:59,500
Oh, ok, ok.

4039
04:03:59,640 --> 04:04:04,320
Yes, we went down here and then we got the effigy from here with the worms.

4040
04:04:05,120 --> 04:04:06,400
And then we went this way.

4041
04:04:07,280 --> 04:04:09,540
And then there was an up here, but there was more.

4042
04:04:10,100 --> 04:04:12,840
There was also ups and stuff down here.

4043
04:04:13,080 --> 04:04:14,060
Do I go up this?

4044
04:04:20,790 --> 04:04:22,590
Oh, I found things in here.

4045
04:04:24,550 --> 04:04:28,790
Why am I so...why is this messing with me so much today?

4046
04:04:28,930 --> 04:04:35,390
Usually I'm pretty alright with remembering some of these places, but this is screwing with my mind!

4047
04:04:39,110 --> 04:04:39,610
Andrew!

4048
04:04:40,170 --> 04:04:41,050
Thank you for the raid!

4049
04:04:41,050 --> 04:04:43,790
Welcome back, master and lady!

4050
04:04:44,290 --> 04:04:46,130
Hello, my name is Mint.

4051
04:04:46,750 --> 04:04:49,850
I'm a...I'm a ghost made Vtuber.

4052
04:04:50,070 --> 04:04:52,690
I'm playing Eternal Darkness and I'm really lost right now.

4053
04:04:52,770 --> 04:04:55,710
So sorry, you're coming out of an awkward time.

4054
04:04:56,130 --> 04:04:56,390
Hello!

4055
04:04:56,670 --> 04:04:57,310
Thanks for the raid!

4056
04:04:59,090 --> 04:04:59,350
Ok.

4057
04:05:02,150 --> 04:05:03,510
I'm so lost.

4058
04:05:03,610 --> 04:05:05,250
Oh guys, I'm so lost!

4059
04:05:05,430 --> 04:05:06,430
Oh no!

4060
04:05:06,810 --> 04:05:08,310
I can't remember at all!

4061
04:05:08,310 --> 04:05:08,390
No!

4062
04:05:09,690 --> 04:05:10,750
Oh my gosh!

4063
04:05:12,810 --> 04:05:15,670
I have low sanity right now.

4064
04:05:17,070 --> 04:05:18,530
Back to the worm pit.

4065
04:05:18,890 --> 04:05:20,050
Up the wall ladder.

4066
04:05:20,210 --> 04:05:21,390
Down the...ok, hold on.

4067
04:05:24,570 --> 04:05:27,010
Rett is my GameFAQs right now.

4068
04:05:28,730 --> 04:05:30,750
Rett is my GameFAQs tutorial.

4069
04:05:30,950 --> 04:05:31,310
Thank you.

4070
04:05:31,750 --> 04:05:32,790
I'm so lost.

4071
04:05:33,430 --> 04:05:35,090
Guys, I'm so lost.

4072
04:05:35,090 --> 04:05:38,150
I feel so stupid right now.

4073
04:05:40,810 --> 04:05:41,490
Ok.

4074
04:05:41,850 --> 04:05:42,410
Worm pit!

4075
04:05:44,430 --> 04:05:46,230
Up the wall la...wait.

4076
04:05:46,530 --> 04:05:47,050
Worm pit.

4077
04:05:47,510 --> 04:05:48,590
Up the wall ladder.

4078
04:05:50,750 --> 04:05:52,110
Back down the hall.

4079
04:05:56,510 --> 04:05:58,370
Door to the broken zombie crusher.

4080
04:05:58,490 --> 04:05:58,950
Into the hall.

4081
04:06:00,170 --> 04:06:00,790
What?

4082
04:06:01,170 --> 04:06:01,450
Ok.

4083
04:06:07,260 --> 04:06:08,420
You're talking about the game.

4084
04:06:09,220 --> 04:06:09,720
Yeah.

4085
04:06:10,320 --> 04:06:11,280
I'm playing a game.

4086
04:06:11,860 --> 04:06:13,460
Ok, so zombie head crusher.

4087
04:06:14,580 --> 04:06:16,160
And we go...

4088
04:06:16,160 --> 04:06:17,020
Wrong parameter!

4089
04:06:17,140 --> 04:06:18,140
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

4090
04:06:19,300 --> 04:06:20,840
Door next to the zombie crusher.

4091
04:06:21,020 --> 04:06:21,580
End of the hall.

4092
04:06:27,820 --> 04:06:29,720
Oh my god!

4093
04:06:32,060 --> 04:06:35,740
An innocuous panel wall caps this end of the room.

4094
04:06:35,840 --> 04:06:39,420
It is conspicuously empty by comparison to the other walls of the room.

4095
04:06:40,380 --> 04:06:42,740
There was a...oh my gosh.

4096
04:06:43,220 --> 04:06:44,460
Silent Hill 2 moment.

4097
04:06:44,620 --> 04:06:46,960
There was a...there was a door here.

4098
04:06:47,080 --> 04:06:48,080
It's gone now.

4099
04:06:49,620 --> 04:06:50,380
Mix?

4100
04:06:51,460 --> 04:06:53,760
What do I mix the explosives with?

4101
04:06:54,000 --> 04:06:54,560
A gun.

4102
04:06:56,820 --> 04:06:59,420
Mix the explosives with...

4103
04:06:59,960 --> 04:07:01,540
The essence of...

4104
04:07:01,540 --> 04:07:01,800
Yeah.

4105
04:07:08,720 --> 04:07:23,080
What's the detonator?

4106
04:07:23,920 --> 04:07:25,200
Why can't I just shoot it?

4107
04:07:31,590 --> 04:07:32,630
What's the...

4108
04:07:36,940 --> 04:07:37,380
Damn.

4109
04:07:39,380 --> 04:07:41,080
What is the...

4110
04:07:44,850 --> 04:07:45,730
The detonator.

4111
04:07:46,650 --> 04:07:47,890
Shape it into a butterfly.

4112
04:07:48,130 --> 04:07:49,050
Do you know it?

4113
04:07:54,180 --> 04:07:54,620
Detonator?

4114
04:07:54,800 --> 04:07:55,720
I hardly know it.

4115
04:07:58,880 --> 04:08:00,840
Ok, well now...

4116
04:08:00,840 --> 04:08:02,340
C4 is tricky to explode.

4117
04:08:02,440 --> 04:08:03,580
I'm not even sure if shooting would work.

4118
04:08:03,640 --> 04:08:03,840
Really?

4119
04:08:03,840 --> 04:08:03,960
Why?

4120
04:08:06,680 --> 04:08:08,920
Ok, well now we are at another impasse.

4121
04:08:11,620 --> 04:08:14,840
Because I don't have the detonator.

4122
04:08:15,820 --> 04:08:18,240
Ok, what's that red thing in your inventory?

4123
04:08:19,160 --> 04:08:20,000
Red thing?

4124
04:08:21,540 --> 04:08:22,160
This?

4125
04:08:22,240 --> 04:08:22,740
My flashlight?

4126
04:08:25,900 --> 04:08:30,140
I don't have anything like a...I only have guns in my inventory.

4127
04:08:30,140 --> 04:08:30,360
Don't worry.

4128
04:09:02,100 --> 04:09:03,800
Which...I'm just gonna do the highest level.

4129
04:09:04,240 --> 04:09:05,900
If I do purple, will it do all of them?

4130
04:09:06,840 --> 04:09:07,920
Time to find out.

4131
04:09:08,960 --> 04:09:10,700
If only there was a spell that made it invisible.

4132
04:09:11,200 --> 04:09:12,400
I'm way ahead of you.

4133
04:09:17,780 --> 04:09:19,240
Oh, now I'm invisible.

4134
04:09:19,780 --> 04:09:21,180
I forgot that it does the opposite.

4135
04:09:26,310 --> 04:09:26,950
Oopsie.

4136
04:09:30,510 --> 04:09:33,350
Let me just get my magic back, you guys.

4137
04:09:33,530 --> 04:09:34,870
Ok, reveal invisible.

4138
04:09:37,410 --> 04:09:39,250
I don't know what level it needs to be.

4139
04:09:52,080 --> 04:09:53,740
It's not invisible.

4140
04:09:54,220 --> 04:09:55,640
I can clearly see it.

4141
04:09:55,880 --> 04:09:56,940
Right there!

4142
04:10:03,000 --> 04:10:04,400
How about that?

4143
04:10:16,060 --> 04:10:17,240
Oh my god.

4144
04:10:21,990 --> 04:10:22,670
Oh my god.

4145
04:10:23,670 --> 04:10:25,070
Wow, I remember this room.

4146
04:10:27,070 --> 04:10:27,930
Detonator caps!

4147
04:10:28,030 --> 04:10:29,530
Receive some more plastic explosives!

4148
04:10:29,830 --> 04:10:30,670
Handle with care!

4149
04:10:31,770 --> 04:10:33,710
We have a detonator cap!

4150
04:10:34,730 --> 04:10:36,150
Oh my gosh.

4151
04:10:36,490 --> 04:10:37,330
Wait, what's going on here?

4152
04:10:42,110 --> 04:10:42,650
What?

4153
04:10:42,650 --> 04:10:42,870
I know.

4154
04:10:43,310 --> 04:10:45,330
Ok, here...

4155
04:10:48,490 --> 04:10:50,810
I just need the shield, right?

4156
04:10:50,990 --> 04:10:53,330
It's the shield for like...

4157
04:10:53,910 --> 04:10:54,910
Just in case.

4158
04:10:56,150 --> 04:10:58,230
It's the shield for...

4159
04:10:59,230 --> 04:11:00,310
Destroy this.

4160
04:11:01,570 --> 04:11:04,450
It's the shield for...Purple can work, right?

4161
04:11:04,650 --> 04:11:05,050
I guess.

4162
04:11:07,550 --> 04:11:08,710
Stop backseating, Elder God.

4163
04:11:08,890 --> 04:11:10,370
I know, he's so needy.

4164
04:11:10,830 --> 04:11:11,850
Like, chill out.

4165
04:11:11,970 --> 04:11:13,110
I'm almost there.

4166
04:11:16,110 --> 04:11:16,530
Shield.

4167
04:11:17,950 --> 04:11:18,370
Purple.

4168
04:11:21,550 --> 04:11:23,710
Run around, run around, run around, run around.

4169
04:11:26,550 --> 04:11:30,110
Wish I had some liquid courage right now, but... for my magic.

4170
04:11:30,890 --> 04:11:32,690
Run around, run around, run around, run around.

4171
04:11:51,010 --> 04:11:52,730
Maybe...ok, what if I did 5?

4172
04:11:53,670 --> 04:11:54,750
Do you think I'd still make it?

4173
04:11:56,350 --> 04:11:57,430
Time to see.

4174
04:11:58,190 --> 04:11:59,090
Time to see!

4175
04:12:04,250 --> 04:12:08,690
2, 3, 4, 5...

4176
04:12:10,590 --> 04:12:12,030
It worked.

4177
04:12:13,130 --> 04:12:16,070
Let's rock spells are cast at a premium over normal spells.

4178
04:12:16,410 --> 04:12:19,190
Oh, I'm pretty sure Michael is the only one who is too low to cast some.

4179
04:12:19,690 --> 04:12:20,290
Michael!

4180
04:12:21,610 --> 04:12:22,450
It's ok.

4181
04:12:23,170 --> 04:12:25,490
He's been good, so I'm not...ok.

4182
04:12:26,030 --> 04:12:27,650
We gotta destroy the worms, everybody.

4183
04:12:28,570 --> 04:12:30,030
Put down the C4...

4184
04:12:32,770 --> 04:12:37,530
Sorry, these cutscenes are taking me out.

4185
04:12:38,390 --> 04:12:40,310
They're so fast.

4186
04:12:44,430 --> 04:12:45,630
They're like...

4187
04:12:54,710 --> 04:12:55,310
Reload!

4188
04:12:59,330 --> 04:13:00,530
Destroy this.

4189
04:13:02,970 --> 04:13:05,110
The lever is gone now.

4190
04:13:05,750 --> 04:13:06,750
Can we still see these?

4191
04:13:07,030 --> 04:13:08,410
He doesn't even care.

4192
04:13:08,510 --> 04:13:10,030
He doesn't want to examine them at all.

4193
04:13:10,650 --> 04:13:12,310
He's like, what's this mumbo-jumbo?

4194
04:13:13,790 --> 04:13:16,630
Why is everybody talking about worms and shit?

4195
04:13:16,630 --> 04:13:18,630
I don't care about worms.

4196
04:13:19,150 --> 04:13:21,570
Mix with the detonator cab.

4197
04:13:22,450 --> 04:13:24,290
We've assembled a bomb!

4198
04:13:31,800 --> 04:13:34,060
Minto assembles a bomb on stream reel.

4199
04:13:40,390 --> 04:13:41,030
Detail.

4200
04:13:41,210 --> 04:13:44,450
For centuries, evil has been channeled through this pit.

4201
04:13:45,530 --> 04:13:47,610
Countless souls sacrificed to the darkness.

4202
04:13:48,230 --> 04:13:49,570
Someone must end this madness.

4203
04:13:49,570 --> 04:13:58,150
A bomb placed here would be enough to pull the already collapsing city down into oblivion.

4204
04:13:58,470 --> 04:14:00,190
Destroying everything inside.

4205
04:14:04,230 --> 04:14:06,390
Do we know that for sure?

4206
04:14:07,730 --> 04:14:08,910
I'm gonna save.

4207
04:14:10,050 --> 04:14:11,310
Is this gonna be timed?

4208
04:14:12,290 --> 04:14:14,170
Oh gosh, we have 3 minutes to get out.

4209
04:14:15,890 --> 04:14:18,190
We have 3 minutes to get out, you guys.

4210
04:14:20,450 --> 04:14:23,430
Even with all the explosives, there's probably not enough to bring down the city.

4211
04:14:24,450 --> 04:14:29,030
There must be some way of making it more powerful and increasing its damage potential.

4212
04:14:34,770 --> 04:14:38,150
How do I make a bomb explode-y harder?

4213
04:14:44,270 --> 04:14:45,190
No way.

4214
04:14:49,240 --> 04:14:50,780
Can I make a 7 point?

4215
04:14:53,760 --> 04:14:54,720
Bargain, bargain.

4216
04:15:08,160 --> 04:15:09,120
Magic bomb.

4217
04:15:12,460 --> 04:15:14,660
Mike has activated the bomb's timer.

4218
04:15:15,160 --> 04:15:16,320
The countdown has begun.

4219
04:15:16,920 --> 04:15:17,780
Almost an answer.

4220
04:15:18,420 --> 04:15:19,360
Oh wait, almost an answer.

4221
04:15:19,500 --> 04:15:23,000
A deep, low rumbling begins to reverberate through the dungeon.

4222
04:15:23,440 --> 04:15:28,220
Mike has 3 minutes to escape the forbidden city and get to save the- 3 minutes to detonation.

4223
04:15:31,440 --> 04:15:31,840
Oh shit.

4224
04:15:35,440 --> 04:15:36,680
Oh no, a shield.

4225
04:15:40,380 --> 04:15:40,740
No!

4226
04:15:40,980 --> 04:15:41,560
Oh my god.

4227
04:15:41,860 --> 04:15:42,400
Wait, wait, wait.

4228
04:15:42,780 --> 04:15:43,820
You guys, we're in trouble.

4229
04:15:44,220 --> 04:15:45,480
We're in trouble, we're in trouble, we're in trouble.

4230
04:16:00,060 --> 04:16:04,780
Is it like one of those- Is it like super giddy giddy like this type of- Why is it rumbly?

4231
04:16:05,560 --> 04:16:07,440
I know, like the guy said he's reacting.

4232
04:16:08,320 --> 04:16:09,060
Oh my god.

4233
04:16:10,880 --> 04:16:13,500
Oh my god, no, he's- No, please.

4234
04:16:15,160 --> 04:16:15,840
Oh, hello?

4235
04:16:16,420 --> 04:16:17,380
I equipped that.

4236
04:16:17,700 --> 04:16:18,340
There we go.

4237
04:16:23,250 --> 04:16:23,870
Oh my god.

4238
04:16:29,030 --> 04:16:29,630
Get out!

4239
04:16:30,990 --> 04:16:32,310
Get out!

4240
04:16:33,430 --> 04:16:34,090
Just run.

4241
04:16:34,730 --> 04:16:35,150
Just run.

4242
04:16:35,670 --> 04:16:36,170
Just run.

4243
04:16:36,890 --> 04:16:37,430
Just run.

4244
04:16:37,630 --> 04:16:38,250
Open the door.

4245
04:16:38,390 --> 04:16:38,710
Open the door.

4246
04:16:40,010 --> 04:16:40,770
Oh my god.

4247
04:16:41,090 --> 04:16:41,610
Oh my god.

4248
04:16:41,710 --> 04:16:42,430
Wait, how do I get out?

4249
04:16:42,790 --> 04:16:43,590
Wait, oh my god.

4250
04:16:46,890 --> 04:16:48,310
Wait, oh gosh.

4251
04:16:48,670 --> 04:16:49,750
The doors are all different.

4252
04:17:02,790 --> 04:17:03,790
Little tinies.

4253
04:17:04,490 --> 04:17:05,370
They're so small.

4254
04:17:08,550 --> 04:17:09,290
Just run.

4255
04:17:10,510 --> 04:17:11,870
First thing you see.

4256
04:17:12,610 --> 04:17:13,530
It's a maze.

4257
04:17:14,190 --> 04:17:15,230
This is messed up.

4258
04:17:15,950 --> 04:17:16,450
Oh my god.

4259
04:17:16,710 --> 04:17:19,210
Wait, I know where- I know where we are, kind of.

4260
04:17:19,530 --> 04:17:21,070
We got the staff in there.

4261
04:17:22,730 --> 04:17:23,950
Oh my god.

4262
04:17:24,610 --> 04:17:25,150
Just run.

4263
04:17:28,510 --> 04:17:29,470
My health.

4264
04:17:30,290 --> 04:17:30,910
My health.

4265
04:17:37,580 --> 04:17:39,290
Is this a door to leave?

4266
04:17:39,790 --> 04:17:40,710
This looks like an exit.

4267
04:17:44,810 --> 04:17:46,030
This looks like an exit.

4268
04:17:48,290 --> 04:17:49,290
I made it!

4269
04:17:51,410 --> 04:17:52,590
I made it!

4270
04:17:52,910 --> 04:17:53,330
I think.

4271
04:17:54,330 --> 04:17:56,830
A few years later.

4272
04:17:58,150 --> 04:17:59,930
Oh my god.

4273
04:17:59,990 --> 04:18:01,150
Welcome to Rhode Island.

4274
04:18:02,610 --> 04:18:03,670
Hello?

4275
04:18:05,410 --> 04:18:07,010
Are you Michael?

4276
04:18:23,410 --> 04:18:24,970
But that's not the point.

4277
04:18:26,570 --> 04:18:27,430
What's this?

4278
04:18:27,790 --> 04:18:28,970
Something you need.

4279
04:18:29,390 --> 04:18:30,350
Don't open it here.

4280
04:18:30,790 --> 04:18:31,590
Only in privacy.

4281
04:18:32,130 --> 04:18:34,510
They can sense it if it's not shrouded.

4282
04:18:35,450 --> 04:18:37,070
Is it one of the artifacts?

4283
04:18:37,990 --> 04:18:39,010
You must leave now.

4284
04:18:39,290 --> 04:18:41,310
But there's something I have to do before they get to me.

4285
04:18:41,990 --> 04:18:43,310
I can't protect you if they find you.

4286
04:18:43,330 --> 04:18:44,290
He has to go to Alaska.

4287
04:18:45,350 --> 04:18:46,110
Good luck.

4288
04:18:47,710 --> 04:18:48,430
Gray Fox!

4289
04:18:53,910 --> 04:18:55,950
Oh my god.

4290
04:18:57,930 --> 04:18:58,990
We did it baby!

4291
04:18:59,170 --> 04:18:59,830
Chapter complete!

4292
04:19:01,830 --> 04:19:02,990
First try.

4293
04:19:03,470 --> 04:19:05,030
We gamed that last bit.

4294
04:19:06,330 --> 04:19:08,650
My chat is frozen once again.

4295
04:19:08,910 --> 04:19:10,950
YouTube is acting so silly to me.

4296
04:19:17,860 --> 04:19:20,660
She has the same reaction every time.

4297
04:19:28,940 --> 04:19:29,720
Hold on.

4298
04:19:29,800 --> 04:19:31,300
I'm trying to get my...

4299
04:19:32,560 --> 04:19:34,680
Trying to get my YouTube back to normal.

4300
04:19:34,840 --> 04:19:35,500
Sorry guys.

4301
04:19:35,600 --> 04:19:36,020
One second.

4302
04:19:44,240 --> 04:19:44,780
Alright.

4303
04:19:44,780 --> 04:19:45,320
So...

4304
04:19:45,320 --> 04:19:46,480
One more chapter?

4305
04:19:49,280 --> 04:19:49,820
After?

4306
04:19:51,220 --> 04:19:51,800
That one?

4307
04:19:54,140 --> 04:19:55,320
One last chapter?

4308
04:19:55,560 --> 04:19:56,200
Or was that it?

4309
04:19:56,780 --> 04:19:57,640
Her sanity.

4310
04:19:57,920 --> 04:19:59,500
I think we should...

4311
04:19:59,500 --> 04:20:02,000
I think we should recover some of that.

4312
04:20:13,890 --> 04:20:15,330
This game is so long.

4313
04:20:15,390 --> 04:20:15,870
I know.

4314
04:20:16,090 --> 04:20:19,510
And the worst...well not the worst, but the best part about it...

4315
04:20:19,510 --> 04:20:21,850
is they want you to play it three times!

4316
04:20:24,690 --> 04:20:27,490
They want you to play it three whole times baby!

4317
04:20:29,370 --> 04:20:30,090
Oh my god!

4318
04:20:31,770 --> 04:20:32,530
Holy cow.

4319
04:20:33,550 --> 04:20:34,770
Scared the heck out of me.

4320
04:20:35,130 --> 04:20:36,190
I didn't hear you at all.

4321
04:20:40,250 --> 04:20:40,650
Hey!

4322
04:20:41,010 --> 04:20:42,130
Stop finishing him please!

4323
04:20:47,680 --> 04:20:48,080
Yeah!

4324
04:20:48,240 --> 04:20:48,900
Take him down!

4325
04:20:50,820 --> 04:20:52,200
Oh, his head is still there.

4326
04:20:57,140 --> 04:21:01,320
Alright, all we got to do is get to the...

4327
04:21:02,920 --> 04:21:04,320
We just got to get to the...

4328
04:21:05,120 --> 04:21:05,960
That one room.

4329
04:21:09,400 --> 04:21:12,460
My house is overrun by zombies!

4330
04:21:13,480 --> 04:21:14,820
This sucks!

4331
04:21:19,620 --> 04:21:24,900
My house was the safest place in the game and now there are zombies.

4332
04:21:25,080 --> 04:21:25,820
It sucks.

4333
04:21:27,960 --> 04:21:28,460
OK.

4334
04:21:28,880 --> 04:21:30,360
It's this room down here.

4335
04:21:33,880 --> 04:21:37,240
The rest of the game is about as long as it took for Edward's chapter.

4336
04:21:37,960 --> 04:21:38,680
Really?

4337
04:21:39,080 --> 04:21:39,620
That's it?

4338
04:21:40,380 --> 04:21:41,660
So about two more hours?

4339
04:21:42,380 --> 04:21:43,800
We got this guys, we got this.

4340
04:21:43,820 --> 04:21:45,060
That's why I started early today.

4341
04:21:47,260 --> 04:21:47,980
OK.

4342
04:21:49,460 --> 04:21:51,140
Ghost complains about undead.

4343
04:21:51,600 --> 04:21:52,000
Look.

4344
04:21:53,920 --> 04:21:54,640
Look.

4345
04:21:58,600 --> 04:21:59,320
Alright.

4346
04:22:00,760 --> 04:22:02,820
We got this.

4347
04:22:04,100 --> 04:22:04,660
Oh.

4348
04:22:07,380 --> 04:22:08,500
Adjust the mirror?

4349
04:22:09,220 --> 04:22:09,500
Wait.

4350
04:22:09,920 --> 04:22:10,880
Can I use it though?

4351
04:22:11,060 --> 04:22:12,240
It won't let me put it in.

4352
04:22:15,120 --> 04:22:15,680
Hello?

4353
04:22:16,900 --> 04:22:19,000
There be dragons here.

4354
04:22:19,560 --> 04:22:21,040
There be dragoons here.

4355
04:22:22,660 --> 04:22:23,640
Oh, maybe here.

4356
04:22:34,000 --> 04:22:35,720
Why won't it let me put it in?

4357
04:22:36,620 --> 04:22:37,480
Maybe here?

4358
04:22:40,720 --> 04:22:42,460
Why won't it let me put it

4359
04:22:56,020 --> 04:22:56,280
in?

4360
04:22:56,600 --> 04:22:56,880
OK.

4361
04:22:57,660 --> 04:22:58,680
Let's do that.

4362
04:23:01,380 --> 04:23:02,920
Maybe I don't need to do that.

4363
04:23:03,700 --> 04:23:04,640
Oh, what did I just do?

4364
04:23:05,020 --> 04:23:07,380
Does it go down here?

4365
04:23:08,180 --> 04:23:09,600
Or does it go over here?

4366
04:23:12,990 --> 04:23:15,310
Maybe I don't need the crank like I thought I did.

4367
04:23:15,790 --> 04:23:16,030
OK.

4368
04:23:17,670 --> 04:23:18,630
And then...

4369
04:23:19,470 --> 04:23:22,250
And then this last one bit right here.

4370
04:23:24,690 --> 04:23:25,730
Aha!

4371
04:23:40,700 --> 04:23:44,320
What about the last artifact?

4372
04:23:46,820 --> 04:23:47,380
And...

4373
04:23:47,940 --> 04:23:51,860
What about the next chapter page?

4374
04:24:00,860 --> 04:24:02,660
I'm just gonna...

4375
04:24:03,500 --> 04:24:04,140
A

4376
04:24:08,860 --> 04:24:09,760
little busy!

4377
04:24:10,580 --> 04:24:11,900
What the hell?

4378
04:24:12,580 --> 04:24:14,080
Can you help me please?

4379
04:24:14,080 --> 04:24:16,000
I'm being attacked by zombies!

4380
04:24:16,360 --> 04:24:18,680
Can you enter my home and leave?

4381
04:24:19,340 --> 04:24:19,720
Wait!

4382
04:24:21,160 --> 04:24:21,720
Wait.

4383
04:24:24,600 --> 04:24:25,120
Wait.

4384
04:24:28,620 --> 04:24:29,140
Wait.

4385
04:24:36,040 --> 04:24:37,400
Not his problem.

4386
04:24:41,160 --> 04:24:42,200
Get

4387
04:24:46,350 --> 04:24:47,390
it.

4388
04:24:47,390 --> 04:24:47,950
Go.

4389
04:24:48,150 --> 04:24:48,330
Go.

4390
04:24:49,190 --> 04:24:49,890
Stupid.

4391
04:24:50,070 --> 04:24:51,490
Stupid skellies.

4392
04:24:51,490 --> 04:24:56,090
Also, whoever said undead, there is a way bigger difference between skellies and ghosts.

4393
04:24:56,810 --> 04:24:59,490
Ghosts are way superior than skellies.

4394
04:25:01,010 --> 04:25:04,350
A package wrapped in brown paper has been left inside the door.

4395
04:25:05,330 --> 04:25:07,130
I got a brown paper parcel!

4396
04:25:08,370 --> 04:25:09,550
What the hell?

4397
04:25:11,230 --> 04:25:13,610
A parcel wrapped in plain brown paper.

4398
04:25:13,830 --> 04:25:16,650
It is not addressed to anyone and appears to have been wrapped in a hurry.

4399
04:25:17,010 --> 04:25:18,210
There might be something inside.

4400
04:25:18,870 --> 04:25:20,830
That means we could leave at any time?

4401
04:25:20,910 --> 04:25:22,950
This guy was able to get inside our house so easily.

4402
04:25:23,370 --> 04:25:24,650
We don't lock the door?

4403
04:25:24,830 --> 04:25:25,930
Oh my gosh!

4404
04:25:26,070 --> 04:25:27,390
Where did this come from?

4405
04:25:30,790 --> 04:25:32,710
We got the essence!

4406
04:25:36,730 --> 04:25:38,590
The enchanted gladius!

4407
04:25:45,230 --> 04:25:48,130
We are the one!

4408
04:25:48,130 --> 04:25:49,430
One star rating.

4409
04:25:49,530 --> 04:25:49,790
Reason?

4410
04:25:49,910 --> 04:25:53,130
They delivered my package while I was being attacked by zombies and didn't send for help.

4411
04:25:53,230 --> 04:25:53,570
Seriously?

4412
04:25:53,970 --> 04:25:57,210
I also would like to rate them a one star because they walked inside my home.

4413
04:26:01,440 --> 04:26:01,880
Wait.

4414
04:26:02,280 --> 04:26:03,260
Can we...

4415
04:26:06,200 --> 04:26:06,940
Do we have?

4416
04:26:07,040 --> 04:26:07,860
Oh we do have it!

4417
04:26:11,360 --> 04:26:12,780
We have the power!

4418
04:26:14,660 --> 04:26:17,260
It's probably gonna be guys down here too so...

4419
04:26:18,580 --> 04:26:19,660
Or not.

4420
04:26:19,980 --> 04:26:21,600
There will be guys inside here.

4421
04:26:24,920 --> 04:26:26,080
Or not.

4422
04:26:27,990 --> 04:26:29,480
Time to save.

4423
04:26:31,420 --> 04:26:32,560
Alex Roivas.

4424
04:26:34,360 --> 04:26:35,840
Try swinging it.

4425
04:26:38,020 --> 04:26:38,780
Rawr.

4426
04:26:38,780 --> 04:26:39,540
Rawr.

4427
04:26:55,660 --> 04:26:57,160
Oh my gosh.

4428
04:26:57,220 --> 04:26:58,040
Alex is here.

4429
04:26:58,860 --> 04:26:59,140
Wait.

4430
04:26:59,160 --> 04:26:59,600
What's this?

4431
04:27:06,400 --> 04:27:07,980
Oh that's the one in the water.

4432
04:27:09,180 --> 04:27:10,800
Is she gonna get her own cutscene with this?

4433
04:27:24,700 --> 04:27:26,840
Sorry I just spat all over my thing.

4434
04:27:31,660 --> 04:27:32,100
Oh.

4435
04:27:32,100 --> 04:27:32,540
Okay.

4436
04:27:35,840 --> 04:27:36,860
Guardians of Zealototh.

4437
04:27:37,280 --> 04:27:39,480
Nine great towers dwarf the surrounding buildings.

4438
04:27:39,800 --> 04:27:45,020
It would appear these towers serve some kind of focusing array, channeling great tides of energy into the city itself.

4439
04:27:50,280 --> 04:27:53,160
Couldn't even get a higher resolution city.

4440
04:27:57,620 --> 04:27:59,120
Are there any things here?

4441
04:27:59,880 --> 04:28:00,660
Oh well.

4442
04:28:01,580 --> 04:28:02,340
Oh my gosh.

4443
04:28:05,840 --> 04:28:08,800
The other guardians I guess would be around huh?

4444
04:28:09,480 --> 04:28:11,080
Oh even the camera angles are a bit different.

4445
04:28:11,160 --> 04:28:11,680
That's neat.

4446
04:28:14,640 --> 04:28:17,960
Because they said there were other colonies like guardian colonies or whatever.

4447
04:28:19,900 --> 04:28:21,360
Let me check my health.

4448
04:28:22,200 --> 04:28:23,240
Oh it's okay for now.

4449
04:28:25,360 --> 04:28:27,100
We were here a few hours ago.

4450
04:28:27,300 --> 04:28:27,860
We were!

4451
04:28:29,540 --> 04:28:30,040
Okay.

4452
04:28:35,370 --> 04:28:38,410
This is what you guys meant by the piss room!

4453
04:28:44,270 --> 04:28:45,230
I remember.

4454
04:28:46,370 --> 04:28:48,770
I had no idea what you guys were talking about.

4455
04:29:01,090 --> 04:29:04,330
That's what they did to this place after...

4456
04:29:06,750 --> 04:29:10,990
After we used the towers to destroy them.

4457
04:29:13,550 --> 04:29:14,790
Oh my goodness.

4458
04:29:16,930 --> 04:29:18,010
Spell list.

4459
04:29:18,610 --> 04:29:19,290
Dispel magic.

4460
04:29:21,050 --> 04:29:22,070
Hold on.

4461
04:29:22,810 --> 04:29:23,790
Oh it's a 7 spell.

4462
04:29:24,050 --> 04:29:26,330
Okay, dispel magic, cast...

4463
04:29:26,930 --> 04:29:27,510
Red!

4464
04:29:28,690 --> 04:29:29,310
What?

4465
04:29:32,210 --> 04:29:32,830
No!

4466
04:29:33,110 --> 04:29:33,930
What the hell!

4467
04:29:34,890 --> 04:29:35,270
Uh oh.

4468
04:29:36,210 --> 04:29:37,070
We're out of shield.

4469
04:29:38,570 --> 04:29:40,210
I don't think we can do this.

4470
04:29:42,790 --> 04:29:43,790
Oh shoot.

4471
04:29:46,410 --> 04:29:46,830
Okay.

4472
04:29:52,670 --> 04:29:53,290
Okay.

4473
04:29:53,610 --> 04:29:54,770
Are we just gonna die then?

4474
04:29:55,370 --> 04:29:56,730
We have nowhere to go.

4475
04:29:57,210 --> 04:29:59,750
Everywhere is covered in piss.

4476
04:30:02,190 --> 04:30:02,950
Poor planning.

4477
04:30:03,070 --> 04:30:04,370
How was I supposed to know?

4478
04:30:05,930 --> 04:30:08,030
How was I supposed to know?

4479
04:30:13,250 --> 04:30:15,530
You can cast dispel magic from the entrance.

4480
04:30:16,190 --> 04:30:17,170
You're going to die now.

4481
04:30:17,350 --> 04:30:17,510
Oh.

4482
04:30:18,210 --> 04:30:20,530
It reaches that far?

4483
04:30:22,710 --> 04:30:23,750
Okay.

4484
04:30:25,470 --> 04:30:27,750
Rest in peace.

4485
04:30:29,470 --> 04:30:36,810
I think I saved right before we went inside the tunnel itself.

4486
04:30:36,990 --> 04:30:37,850
So we'll have to see.

4487
04:30:38,710 --> 04:30:40,050
The darkness comes!

4488
04:30:40,630 --> 04:30:43,730
Well I'm gonna stop the darkness from coming!

4489
04:30:46,130 --> 04:30:47,930
Death by piss.

4490
04:30:48,890 --> 04:30:50,930
Yeah, this is where I...

4491
04:30:52,610 --> 04:30:54,490
So we'll save right before we go inside.

4492
04:31:07,430 --> 04:31:09,590
I fought things twice here.

4493
04:31:09,690 --> 04:31:13,750
I fought some dogs, I fought some giant things, some giant guys.

4494
04:31:14,450 --> 04:31:17,730
There's so much that we fought, you guys, in our journey.

4495
04:31:19,490 --> 04:31:23,410
So much that we fought in the eternal darkness.

4496
04:31:26,010 --> 04:31:27,850
Once you saw the barrier, it should have 180.

4497
04:31:28,010 --> 04:31:29,850
I thought my shield would last.

4498
04:31:30,230 --> 04:31:30,850
Not gonna lie.

4499
04:31:31,670 --> 04:31:34,490
But also, it barely shows you the shield right there.

4500
04:31:34,770 --> 04:31:35,950
So it's like...

4501
04:31:35,950 --> 04:31:37,230
It's so silly.

4502
04:31:39,070 --> 04:31:42,470
So if I can dispel from here...

4503
04:31:55,470 --> 04:31:56,450
That was intense.

4504
04:31:57,150 --> 04:31:58,730
How's our magic looking?

4505
04:32:01,230 --> 04:32:03,490
I want to make it max.

4506
04:32:04,990 --> 04:32:06,210
I needed red.

4507
04:32:26,610 --> 04:32:29,990
Okay, now I need it really max.

4508
04:32:31,670 --> 04:32:33,410
Yeah, I just wanted to parg on more.

4509
04:32:33,630 --> 04:32:36,510
I wanted to hear... what's her name's...

4510
04:32:40,010 --> 04:32:40,570
What's her name?

4511
04:32:41,590 --> 04:32:42,430
The green one.

4512
04:32:43,170 --> 04:32:44,470
The one we're currently fighting.

4513
04:32:44,710 --> 04:32:45,490
I really like her.

4514
04:32:46,570 --> 04:32:49,310
She's so creepy, with like the whispers.

4515
04:32:50,270 --> 04:32:51,530
Zealototh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4516
04:33:02,580 --> 04:33:03,140
Spellist.

4517
04:33:04,460 --> 04:33:05,000
Shield.

4518
04:33:05,740 --> 04:33:06,180
Cast.

4519
04:33:07,920 --> 04:33:08,200
Red.

4520
04:33:08,200 --> 04:33:12,880
Oh, it is Jennifer Hale.

4521
04:33:12,980 --> 04:33:13,560
Oh my god.

4522
04:33:25,180 --> 04:33:25,980
Inside.

4523
04:33:34,200 --> 04:33:35,360
Wait, examine.

4524
04:33:36,880 --> 04:33:37,400
Oh.

4525
04:33:38,220 --> 04:33:44,520
These plants look like the ones Pius had encountered in the Forbidden City where he found the essences of the ancients.

4526
04:33:45,960 --> 04:33:47,820
Do I need to...

4527
04:33:47,820 --> 04:33:49,860
Put the essences there?

4528
04:33:50,740 --> 04:33:52,680
Do I have... I do have them, like...

4529
04:33:52,680 --> 04:33:53,360
Here.

4530
04:33:56,380 --> 04:33:56,900
Okay.

4531
04:33:59,020 --> 04:34:00,160
Maybe... this one.

4532
04:34:00,780 --> 04:34:01,660
Well, there's only two.

4533
04:34:01,880 --> 04:34:02,360
I would need...

4534
04:34:05,580 --> 04:34:06,240
What's this?

4535
04:34:08,420 --> 04:34:10,460
Part of the broken pedestal lies on top of the floor.

4536
04:34:11,720 --> 04:34:12,440
Pedestal fragment.

4537
04:34:12,560 --> 04:34:14,000
Oh, this would be the third one then.

4538
04:34:19,830 --> 04:34:21,350
Maybe it goes here.

4539
04:34:23,490 --> 04:34:25,090
We need another fragment.

4540
04:34:25,370 --> 04:34:26,010
Oh, here, here, here.

4541
04:34:26,350 --> 04:34:26,810
I found it.

4542
04:34:28,030 --> 04:34:28,630
Pick it up.

4543
04:34:29,030 --> 04:34:29,990
We got it.

4544
04:34:30,930 --> 04:34:33,190
Mix them together and what do you got?

4545
04:34:33,190 --> 04:34:38,530
And then we enchant it and fix it.

4546
04:34:40,030 --> 04:34:40,750
Spell it.

4547
04:34:40,950 --> 04:34:41,690
It's enchant, right?

4548
04:34:41,790 --> 04:34:42,390
Let me double check.

4549
04:34:43,050 --> 04:34:43,250
Yeah.

4550
04:34:47,250 --> 04:34:47,770
Cast.

4551
04:34:49,430 --> 04:34:51,250
I'll make it powerful.

4552
04:35:00,300 --> 04:35:01,360
It's been repaired.

4553
04:35:02,160 --> 04:35:04,340
Okay, now we put it back here.

4554
04:35:06,600 --> 04:35:07,160
Nice.

4555
04:35:11,900 --> 04:35:15,680
So now we put some ancient essences in there, right?

4556
04:35:18,520 --> 04:35:19,080
Use...

4557
04:35:19,080 --> 04:35:21,460
Does it matter which way I put them in?

4558
04:35:26,600 --> 04:35:28,560
But we still need the third one.

4559
04:35:29,300 --> 04:35:30,720
That's the one Pius has.

4560
04:35:31,640 --> 04:35:31,980
Okay.

4561
04:35:45,930 --> 04:35:47,250
I have manta rocks?

4562
04:35:48,850 --> 04:35:49,470
Oh I do.

4563
04:35:49,590 --> 04:35:49,910
You are right.

4564
04:35:50,290 --> 04:35:50,830
You are right.

4565
04:35:50,930 --> 04:35:51,330
You are so right.

4566
04:35:52,490 --> 04:35:54,210
I was like I thought I had a third one.

4567
04:36:00,290 --> 04:36:01,690
The star gate is open.

4568
04:36:10,900 --> 04:36:15,460
Let's do this all...all over again.

4569
04:36:27,540 --> 04:36:31,580
Let's do this all...all over again.

4570
04:36:40,340 --> 04:36:43,340
So we are just doing the same thing again, right?

4571
04:36:43,400 --> 04:36:44,360
We are just spelling it?

4572
04:36:45,240 --> 04:36:45,900
Like before?

4573
04:36:51,100 --> 04:36:52,080
What are we fighting?

4574
04:36:52,180 --> 04:36:52,920
How do we beat it?

4575
04:36:53,620 --> 04:36:54,700
We have to...

4576
04:36:54,700 --> 04:36:57,060
They weren't kidding about the eternal part.

4577
04:36:58,740 --> 04:37:00,160
Read grandpa's last note.

4578
04:37:00,480 --> 04:37:01,200
That's right!

4579
04:37:01,280 --> 04:37:02,100
We are summoning!

4580
04:37:02,760 --> 04:37:03,420
That's right!

4581
04:37:03,980 --> 04:37:05,560
We are summoning...

4582
04:37:05,560 --> 04:37:06,340
Oh my gosh.

4583
04:37:07,260 --> 04:37:09,700
So to get rid of green...

4584
04:37:10,260 --> 04:37:11,900
We must summon...

4585
04:37:11,900 --> 04:37:13,200
Wait, we must summon red.

4586
04:37:14,000 --> 04:37:16,460
So yeah, it's still...it's still chaturga.

4587
04:37:18,080 --> 04:37:18,640
Yes.

4588
04:37:19,340 --> 04:37:21,980
Fire beats grass.

4589
04:37:21,980 --> 04:37:24,820
What is the summon spell?

4590
04:37:26,960 --> 04:37:28,000
Would it be summon horror?

4591
04:37:32,280 --> 04:37:33,760
Tear and air attack.

4592
04:37:35,260 --> 04:37:36,680
The biggest summon.

4593
04:37:37,220 --> 04:37:39,500
Alright, let's go do it.

4594
04:37:40,280 --> 04:37:42,980
Let's go summon a friend.

4595
04:37:43,560 --> 04:37:44,240
Maybe a friend.

4596
04:37:44,720 --> 04:37:45,740
A friend.

4597
04:37:46,100 --> 04:37:47,160
Probably a friend.

4598
04:37:48,220 --> 04:37:48,940
We are summoning someone.

4599
04:37:49,140 --> 04:37:51,120
Someone that will help us.

4600
04:37:59,460 --> 04:38:01,320
Glad I got my little revolver.

4601
04:38:04,560 --> 04:38:06,440
It's very...it's very weird.

4602
04:38:07,020 --> 04:38:10,600
Like, I feel very...like when I do the chapters...

4603
04:38:10,600 --> 04:38:16,100
I feel very like I know what weapons exactly and everything that I have.

4604
04:38:16,580 --> 04:38:17,860
Oh, I don't think I hit that guy.

4605
04:38:18,700 --> 04:38:22,160
But when I'm Alex, I don't remember anything at all.

4606
04:38:22,420 --> 04:38:23,260
It's very strange.

4607
04:38:23,880 --> 04:38:25,800
Like I feel very out of my element.

4608
04:38:26,500 --> 04:38:28,000
I guess is the best way to put it.

4609
04:38:32,550 --> 04:38:33,650
Oh, the sword!

4610
04:38:34,290 --> 04:38:35,270
I forgot to try the sword.

4611
04:38:35,710 --> 04:38:37,270
Sorry, I remembered my...OK.

4612
04:38:37,710 --> 04:38:40,350
I forgot that it had something special going on with it.

4613
04:38:55,580 --> 04:38:56,480
Or not.

4614
04:39:01,460 --> 04:39:03,780
It's cool that Alex has weapons from previous heroes.

4615
04:39:04,100 --> 04:39:04,580
Oh,

4616
04:39:07,740 --> 04:39:08,860
it did...

4617
04:39:14,660 --> 04:39:15,380
Weird.

4618
04:39:17,800 --> 04:39:18,520
OK.

4619
04:39:18,860 --> 04:39:19,500
Summon...

4620
04:39:21,140 --> 04:39:22,260
Spell list.

4621
04:39:22,740 --> 04:39:23,220
Not summon.

4622
04:39:23,440 --> 04:39:23,780
Shield.

4623
04:39:24,260 --> 04:39:24,800
Cast.

4624
04:39:33,100 --> 04:39:34,180
And run!

4625
04:39:48,620 --> 04:39:50,180
Quick spelling the shield.

4626
04:39:50,320 --> 04:39:50,740
You know what?

4627
04:39:50,800 --> 04:39:52,100
That's probably smart.

4628
04:39:52,760 --> 04:39:53,620
I'll do it right now.

4629
04:39:54,540 --> 04:39:57,200
Even though I did that earlier and I completely forgot.

4630
04:39:58,620 --> 04:40:00,780
Oh wait, not cast a sign.

4631
04:40:01,080 --> 04:40:02,320
I forgot which one I did it to.

4632
04:40:03,240 --> 04:40:04,620
I'll do it under...

4633
04:40:05,940 --> 04:40:07,080
OK, up.

4634
04:40:07,520 --> 04:40:08,160
Number one.

4635
04:40:08,540 --> 04:40:09,140
The top one.

4636
04:40:09,760 --> 04:40:12,100
The top D-pad is it.

4637
04:40:12,260 --> 04:40:12,420
OK.

4638
04:40:13,020 --> 04:40:14,320
I'll try to remember, guys.

4639
04:40:14,480 --> 04:40:16,380
No promises, but I'll try to remember.

4640
04:40:17,000 --> 04:40:18,140
I'll try to remember.

4641
04:40:18,780 --> 04:40:20,740
I'm gonna go in a circle this time.

4642
04:40:20,740 --> 04:40:25,700
I'm gonna go from the far left and we'll go all the way around.

4643
04:40:34,560 --> 04:40:35,800
Guys, it's not focusing.

4644
04:40:36,360 --> 04:40:37,780
Guys, it's not...

4645
04:40:37,780 --> 04:40:39,680
It's not focusing for some reason.

4646
04:40:40,540 --> 04:40:41,980
It's not focusing on him.

4647
04:40:42,340 --> 04:40:43,180
It's not focusing.

4648
04:40:51,860 --> 04:40:53,320
For some reason it's not fo...

4649
04:40:53,860 --> 04:40:54,660
Oh my god.

4650
04:41:05,600 --> 04:41:08,340
I don't know why it wasn't focusing.

4651
04:41:09,580 --> 04:41:10,060
Weird.

4652
04:41:16,800 --> 04:41:17,280
Paragon.

4653
04:41:18,020 --> 04:41:19,720
I hope the next one is Paragon too.

4654
04:41:25,360 --> 04:41:27,120
Maybe it only works on the final boss.

4655
04:41:27,360 --> 04:41:28,600
I've never tried it on normal enemies.

4656
04:41:37,500 --> 04:41:38,480
I'm in town.

4657
04:41:50,120 --> 04:41:53,320
Is there a way to get around it?

4658
04:41:54,860 --> 04:41:56,460
Do I have to cast a spell?

4659
04:42:07,640 --> 04:42:12,800
What if I summon a bunch of zombies and I use them like a bridge.

4660
04:42:13,180 --> 04:42:15,160
And I just walk on top of them.

4661
04:42:16,960 --> 04:42:18,120
That would be so awesome.

4662
04:42:19,120 --> 04:42:22,300
Red invisible, that's what I was thinking was gonna be the reveal invisible.

4663
04:42:22,660 --> 04:42:27,660
I imagine all of these are gonna be like 7 point levels, so let's just try it.

4664
04:42:27,660 --> 04:42:28,920
Oh my god.

4665
04:42:36,960 --> 04:42:39,760
And then all of these levers, I don't have to do anything with them.

4666
04:42:47,940 --> 04:42:48,420
Awesome.

4667
04:42:50,840 --> 04:42:52,040
How's our magic looking?

4668
04:42:52,700 --> 04:42:53,180
Good?

4669
04:42:58,370 --> 04:43:00,050
What if we made the bridge?

4670
04:43:02,670 --> 04:43:07,350
Yeah, they made it so I don't have to pull the levers again, but I'm...

4671
04:43:08,270 --> 04:43:13,330
I'm wondering why the doors are working and why do they just go away then.

4672
04:43:13,550 --> 04:43:15,010
When I don't pull the lever, you know.

4673
04:43:16,690 --> 04:43:17,990
I want to pull the lever.

4674
04:43:22,640 --> 04:43:24,780
How bad is the final boss in this?

4675
04:43:26,340 --> 04:43:27,600
Am I gonna cry?

4676
04:43:29,660 --> 04:43:31,060
Am I gonna be really sad?

4677
04:43:32,240 --> 04:43:34,120
God, it looks so scary here now.

4678
04:43:42,970 --> 04:43:43,490
Summon.

4679
04:43:45,850 --> 04:43:48,670
We need Tear and Aratak.

4680
04:43:53,950 --> 04:43:54,630
Aratak.

4681
04:43:54,850 --> 04:43:55,310
There we go.

4682
04:43:56,150 --> 04:43:56,670
Creature.

4683
04:43:59,650 --> 04:44:00,330
Creature!

4684
04:44:02,070 --> 04:44:03,630
Let me save real quick.

4685
04:44:05,090 --> 04:44:06,210
Save before each room.

4686
04:44:07,510 --> 04:44:10,450
A lot easier with the Enchanted Gladius and the Mantarok rune.

4687
04:44:11,050 --> 04:44:11,650
Yeah!

4688
04:44:12,850 --> 04:44:14,550
I love having things.

4689
04:44:21,100 --> 04:44:23,460
Yeah, it doesn't focus on them.

4690
04:44:25,540 --> 04:44:26,380
It's okay.

4691
04:44:26,600 --> 04:44:27,240
I got a gun.

4692
04:44:33,530 --> 04:44:34,150
Reload!

4693
04:44:35,090 --> 04:44:36,450
I love having a gun.

4694
04:44:37,930 --> 04:44:38,950
Oh my god, shut up!

4695
04:44:39,690 --> 04:44:40,310
Shut up!

4696
04:44:42,430 --> 04:44:43,450
Shut up!

4697
04:44:44,490 --> 04:44:45,290
Shut up.

4698
04:44:48,730 --> 04:44:50,170
Peace and quiet.

4699
04:44:53,820 --> 04:44:55,680
This room is so smoky.

4700
04:44:57,120 --> 04:44:58,780
I don't quite remember it.

4701
04:45:00,180 --> 04:45:02,460
Oh, there's blood down there and everything.

4702
04:45:03,440 --> 04:45:04,840
Peace at last.

4703
04:45:05,200 --> 04:45:05,440
I know.

4704
04:45:06,340 --> 04:45:08,700
You just shoot everything for the peace.

4705
04:45:09,820 --> 04:45:12,660
Even the bars have blood on them.

4706
04:45:16,100 --> 04:45:17,360
Revolver Alex.

4707
04:45:17,600 --> 04:45:18,680
Six shots.

4708
04:45:19,160 --> 04:45:21,600
Enough to kill any trapper that moves.

4709
04:45:24,220 --> 04:45:25,540
Oh, this stays.

4710
04:45:25,640 --> 04:45:26,460
That's so good.

4711
04:45:27,760 --> 04:45:28,800
Thank goodness.

4712
04:45:29,040 --> 04:45:31,260
Oh my gosh, imagine if you had to use it every time.

4713
04:45:33,080 --> 04:45:33,720
Screams.

4714
04:45:33,820 --> 04:45:35,100
Any trapper that screams.

4715
04:45:47,300 --> 04:45:49,160
Running, running and running.

4716
04:45:49,720 --> 04:45:50,720
Running and running.

4717
04:45:54,380 --> 04:45:55,020
Alrighty.

4718
04:46:00,100 --> 04:46:01,220
How many left?

4719
04:46:01,380 --> 04:46:02,700
One, two...

4720
04:46:02,700 --> 04:46:06,180
Three, four, five, six.

4721
04:46:07,100 --> 04:46:07,580
Alright.

4722
04:46:09,940 --> 04:46:12,060
Well, five including this one, so six.

4723
04:46:15,060 --> 04:46:17,080
When in doubt, cast gun everybody.

4724
04:46:18,420 --> 04:46:19,600
I promise it works.

4725
04:46:21,180 --> 04:46:21,740
Paragon!

4726
04:46:22,120 --> 04:46:23,860
Do you think the next one will be Paragon?

4727
04:46:25,860 --> 04:46:27,240
I sure hope so.

4728
04:46:31,390 --> 04:46:32,370
Getting close.

4729
04:46:32,430 --> 04:46:33,490
We are, we're getting close.

4730
04:46:36,410 --> 04:46:37,070
Oh.

4731
04:46:39,050 --> 04:46:39,710
What?

4732
04:46:44,150 --> 04:46:45,710
This is the museum room.

4733
04:46:47,710 --> 04:46:50,710
It showed zombie, little trapper and then the big guy.

4734
04:47:01,200 --> 04:47:04,200
Can I not leave until I summon a friend?

4735
04:47:05,860 --> 04:47:06,420
Okay.

4736
04:47:08,100 --> 04:47:09,920
You couldn't... I just had a little cough.

4737
04:47:11,440 --> 04:47:12,760
I see.

4738
04:47:12,940 --> 04:47:13,880
I cannot leave.

4739
04:47:13,880 --> 04:47:16,080
Until I solve the puzzle.

4740
04:47:16,380 --> 04:47:17,400
Can I save in here?

4741
04:47:18,300 --> 04:47:18,860
Oh, I can.

4742
04:47:22,220 --> 04:47:25,080
Let's see what going on top of the big guy does.

4743
04:47:27,600 --> 04:47:29,880
Let's see what happens...

4744
04:47:31,600 --> 04:47:32,040
Here.

4745
04:47:34,460 --> 04:47:38,960
Attached to the monolith is a metal plaque marked with a symbol that looks like a silhouette of a horror.

4746
04:47:40,640 --> 04:47:41,840
That's not very nice.

4747
04:47:41,940 --> 04:47:44,660
Oh, I think I have to summon a green guy here.

4748
04:47:45,920 --> 04:47:46,400
Maybe.

4749
04:47:46,920 --> 04:47:49,180
But I can only do one summon at a time.

4750
04:47:51,960 --> 04:47:53,080
Belongs in a museum.

4751
04:47:57,720 --> 04:47:59,340
But maybe it will trap him.

4752
04:47:59,760 --> 04:48:00,420
Let's try it.

4753
04:48:00,620 --> 04:48:01,260
Summon horror.

4754
04:48:02,720 --> 04:48:03,200
Green.

4755
04:48:12,290 --> 04:48:13,650
There he is.

4756
04:48:15,910 --> 04:48:17,290
Here he goes.

4757
04:48:20,630 --> 04:48:22,670
He is back in the museum!

4758
04:48:25,710 --> 04:48:27,890
He belongs in a museum.

4759
04:48:30,550 --> 04:48:32,290
Oh my gosh.

4760
04:48:34,170 --> 04:48:36,090
Okay, next we do red zombie.

4761
04:48:36,090 --> 04:48:36,150
Maybe.

4762
04:48:39,870 --> 04:48:40,730
Summon zombie.

4763
04:48:41,890 --> 04:48:42,410
Red zombie.

4764
04:48:46,170 --> 04:48:47,070
I'm so glad.

4765
04:48:47,150 --> 04:48:48,710
There are these other monsters in here.

4766
04:48:48,810 --> 04:48:51,150
They look pretty gnarly.

4767
04:48:51,290 --> 04:48:52,890
I'm glad we never had to fight against them.

4768
04:48:54,650 --> 04:48:56,690
Okay, I'll go into my museum.

4769
04:48:56,690 --> 04:48:56,870
Museum.

4770
04:49:03,670 --> 04:49:04,170
Okay.

4771
04:49:05,410 --> 04:49:06,910
Get Indiana Jones dude.

4772
04:49:07,630 --> 04:49:08,130
Nice.

4773
04:49:12,070 --> 04:49:15,150
Alright, now we kind of have to run around a little bit before we summon our...

4774
04:49:15,830 --> 04:49:17,310
Before we summon our trapper.

4775
04:49:20,310 --> 04:49:21,990
Looks curiously like a trapper.

4776
04:49:28,250 --> 04:49:29,730
Getting my magic back.

4777
04:49:29,790 --> 04:49:31,550
We'll need more magic anyway for the shield.

4778
04:49:37,340 --> 04:49:39,640
Yeah, Alex recovers magic really fast.

4779
04:49:39,700 --> 04:49:40,400
She's kind of awesome.

4780
04:49:41,680 --> 04:49:43,280
I mean she's the guardian of light.

4781
04:49:43,860 --> 04:49:44,660
She's a badass.

4782
04:49:51,920 --> 04:49:53,040
Summon trapper.

4783
04:49:53,740 --> 04:49:54,720
I cast blue.

4784
04:50:03,280 --> 04:50:04,260
There we go.

4785
04:50:08,020 --> 04:50:09,720
That sound is triggering me.

4786
04:50:10,740 --> 04:50:11,940
The little...

4787
04:50:14,280 --> 04:50:14,880
Yippee!

4788
04:50:15,200 --> 04:50:16,980
We solved the puzzle.

4789
04:50:17,240 --> 04:50:18,960
We are so smart everybody.

4790
04:50:23,350 --> 04:50:24,530
Stay in there.

4791
04:50:25,130 --> 04:50:26,730
And stay in there!

4792
04:50:28,410 --> 04:50:30,190
Do you think I can make it with this shield?

4793
04:50:30,610 --> 04:50:31,910
Do you think I have to summon again?

4794
04:50:35,350 --> 04:50:38,350
I can't count how many I have left because I...

4795
04:50:41,470 --> 04:50:42,850
You can make it?

4796
04:50:48,540 --> 04:50:49,140
Nice.

4797
04:50:53,430 --> 04:50:55,270
Alright, next one.

4798
04:50:57,330 --> 04:50:58,310
Here we go.

4799
04:51:00,110 --> 04:51:00,970
Parkon, Parkon.

4800
04:51:01,030 --> 04:51:02,350
Oh my gosh, I hope it's Parkon.

4801
04:51:11,350 --> 04:51:11,910
Oh wait.

4802
04:51:13,390 --> 04:51:15,950
Let's reload our gun here.

4803
04:51:21,530 --> 04:51:22,930
I saw him.

4804
04:51:23,050 --> 04:51:26,350
I saw him with my ultra vision.

4805
04:51:27,110 --> 04:51:28,130
My night vision.

4806
04:51:29,290 --> 04:51:30,070
Parkon!

4807
04:51:30,430 --> 04:51:32,530
I'm ready to Parkon!

4808
04:51:32,530 --> 04:51:32,690
Parkon!

4809
04:51:45,210 --> 04:51:48,250
Interesting that there is mostly only little trappers here.

4810
04:51:48,330 --> 04:51:50,730
I say as I'm probably going to go into a crazy fight.

4811
04:51:54,290 --> 04:51:55,890
That's not what I expected.

4812
04:51:55,890 --> 04:51:55,930
That's not what I expected.

4813
04:52:07,840 --> 04:52:09,000
Purple floor.

4814
04:52:09,360 --> 04:52:13,870
If I touch it, what happens?

4815
04:52:15,710 --> 04:52:17,050
Purple floor?

4816
04:52:17,730 --> 04:52:18,270
Save?

4817
04:52:18,470 --> 04:52:19,330
I can't.

4818
04:52:21,690 --> 04:52:24,470
What if it was purple?

4819
04:52:27,070 --> 04:52:28,410
Let's see.

4820
04:52:29,270 --> 04:52:30,510
I'm scared to go under.

4821
04:52:31,230 --> 04:52:35,010
Oh, maybe it's fine.

4822
04:52:35,890 --> 04:52:36,330
Just kidding.

4823
04:52:36,670 --> 04:52:37,370
Just kidding!

4824
04:52:47,340 --> 04:52:50,420
These cutscenes are so funny.

4825
04:52:52,200 --> 04:52:53,700
You can't Parkon.

4826
04:52:53,740 --> 04:52:56,040
Send someone to Parkon.

4827
04:52:58,060 --> 04:53:01,860
Now the floor is... Wait, did we get sent to the past?

4828
04:53:12,230 --> 04:53:12,970
Are we in the...

4829
04:53:14,950 --> 04:53:15,750
Let's see.

4830
04:53:16,590 --> 04:53:19,090
This is my favorite 2000s game.

4831
04:53:19,190 --> 04:53:19,890
Thanks for playing this.

4832
04:53:19,970 --> 04:53:20,410
Thank you!

4833
04:53:20,690 --> 04:53:21,470
Thank you so much!

4834
04:53:21,670 --> 04:53:22,330
Is it right?

4835
04:53:22,430 --> 04:53:23,310
I hope I'm saying it right.

4836
04:53:23,370 --> 04:53:23,990
Thank you!

4837
04:53:25,530 --> 04:53:28,090
Yeah, I did not get any info from that cutscene.

4838
04:53:28,390 --> 04:53:30,050
Wait, there is something flashing over there.

4839
04:53:30,170 --> 04:53:30,850
Let's see what it is.

4840
04:53:31,450 --> 04:53:32,430
Unless it's just fire.

4841
04:53:33,830 --> 04:53:35,590
It's just fire.

4842
04:53:41,730 --> 04:53:42,990
What do we have?

4843
04:53:43,070 --> 04:53:43,870
Reveal invisible?

4844
04:53:45,170 --> 04:53:46,130
Dispel magic?

4845
04:54:01,690 --> 04:54:03,190
Recover more sanity?

4846
04:54:03,450 --> 04:54:05,270
I don't think that will do it.

4847
04:54:07,070 --> 04:54:07,990
Shoot gut.

4848
04:54:15,980 --> 04:54:19,580
I remember being so confused because that looks like a pedestal where you put something.

4849
04:54:22,340 --> 04:54:24,180
I don't think this is a sanity effect.

4850
04:54:24,280 --> 04:54:26,420
This is a puzzle, but we just...

4851
04:54:27,580 --> 04:54:29,660
Every time a worm comes, I just shoot it.

4852
04:54:29,700 --> 04:54:30,900
So I don't know...

4853
04:54:30,900 --> 04:54:36,660
I don't know because I can't get out.

4854
04:54:36,760 --> 04:54:39,300
If it was a sanity effect, I would still be able to leave.

4855
04:54:40,400 --> 04:54:45,240
But every time a worm happens, I just shoot it.

4856
04:54:45,660 --> 04:54:48,540
So I don't really know how to deal here.

4857
04:54:56,420 --> 04:54:57,600
What do I do?

4858
04:55:11,930 --> 04:55:14,130
You might need to max your sanity again.

4859
04:55:15,590 --> 04:55:16,550
I'll try.

4860
04:55:19,570 --> 04:55:20,650
I'll try.

4861
04:55:24,590 --> 04:55:26,030
I don't know if this will be enough.

4862
04:55:36,090 --> 04:55:38,070
We are back where we started.

4863
04:55:50,790 --> 04:55:51,590
You need to walk...

4864
04:55:51,590 --> 04:55:54,150
I was going to try and figure it out.

4865
04:55:54,450 --> 04:55:56,210
You need to walk from the start of...

4866
04:55:57,730 --> 04:56:02,310
I was going to try and get it myself, but I don't think I would have guessed that.

4867
04:56:02,470 --> 04:56:04,150
I'm going to go really slow.

4868
04:56:04,970 --> 04:56:07,350
Usually the worm resets you if you run, so now I'm confused.

4869
04:56:09,670 --> 04:56:10,950
Let's see if it resets now.

4870
04:56:14,890 --> 04:56:18,130
Oh, he just takes all my sanity!

4871
04:56:23,710 --> 04:56:24,990
OK, well...

4872
04:56:24,990 --> 04:56:25,610
OK.

4873
04:56:26,190 --> 04:56:27,690
Walk without rhythm.

4874
04:56:29,590 --> 04:56:32,470
Sometimes let me try a little bit with the puzzles.

4875
04:56:32,590 --> 04:56:34,370
I really appreciate it, but let me...

4876
04:56:34,370 --> 04:56:36,970
I don't need an immediate answer always.

4877
04:56:41,770 --> 04:56:44,590
Let's see if we can... How slow is slow?

4878
04:56:49,470 --> 04:56:50,030
Oopsie.

4879
04:56:51,090 --> 04:56:51,650
OK,

4880
04:56:54,660 --> 04:56:55,520
here we go.

4881
04:56:56,240 --> 04:56:56,960
Here we go.

4882
04:56:58,140 --> 04:56:59,440
Don't notice me, worm.

4883
04:57:00,480 --> 04:57:01,860
My fingers are sweaty.

4884
04:57:02,760 --> 04:57:03,280
Here we go.

4885
04:57:07,730 --> 04:57:08,550
OK, here we go.

4886
04:57:09,250 --> 04:57:09,870
Here we go.

4887
04:57:14,370 --> 04:57:15,530
Oh.

4888
04:57:17,070 --> 04:57:18,230
Oh.

4889
04:57:18,990 --> 04:57:20,150
Oh.

4890
04:57:20,170 --> 04:57:21,330
Oh.

4891
04:57:22,870 --> 04:57:24,430
I'm walking.

4892
04:57:24,770 --> 04:57:26,570
I'm walking here.

4893
04:57:27,170 --> 04:57:29,110
I'm walking here.

4894
04:57:29,370 --> 04:57:30,990
I'm walking.

4895
04:57:31,370 --> 04:57:33,210
I'm walking here.

4896
04:57:34,110 --> 04:57:35,450
I'm walking here.

4897
04:57:36,610 --> 04:57:37,990
I'm walking...

4898
04:57:37,990 --> 04:57:38,230
Oh.

4899
04:57:39,690 --> 04:57:41,290
Can I...

4900
04:57:41,290 --> 04:57:44,270
Can I... If I get out of the purple, can I run?

4901
04:57:45,930 --> 04:57:47,330
I'm walking here.

4902
04:57:52,120 --> 04:57:53,380
Maybe it's okay now.

4903
04:57:55,320 --> 04:57:56,240
I'm out of the purple.

4904
04:58:00,340 --> 04:58:00,760
Okay, bye.

4905
04:58:05,660 --> 04:58:06,220
Nice.

4906
04:58:07,220 --> 04:58:08,340
I was walking.

4907
04:58:12,060 --> 04:58:13,300
Here we go.

4908
04:58:14,020 --> 04:58:14,740
Meow.

4909
04:58:15,660 --> 04:58:16,020
Meow.

4910
04:58:16,800 --> 04:58:17,160
Meow.

4911
04:58:19,300 --> 04:58:20,020
Okay.

4912
04:58:21,460 --> 04:58:22,980
Sneaking mission real.

4913
04:58:24,100 --> 04:58:26,380
Everything turns into a sneaking mission.

4914
04:58:27,300 --> 04:58:28,240
All the time.

4915
04:58:29,100 --> 04:58:30,360
All the time.

4916
04:58:30,440 --> 04:58:31,960
I can't escape the sneaking mission.

4917
04:58:49,710 --> 04:58:51,850
How many of you wanna guess Paragon?

4918
04:58:53,810 --> 04:58:56,990
Type Paragon in the chat if you think it's Paragon.

4919
04:59:05,510 --> 04:59:06,710
Not Paragon.

4920
04:59:07,750 --> 04:59:08,350
Paragon.

4921
04:59:08,350 --> 04:59:08,950
Paragon.

4922
04:59:09,710 --> 04:59:11,790
Actually, what's the other one that we need?

4923
04:59:12,650 --> 04:59:15,510
Probably would be good to see what it is.

4924
04:59:15,710 --> 04:59:17,190
Summon horror...

4925
04:59:17,190 --> 04:59:20,050
We already did... Oh, we need Tear.

4926
04:59:20,410 --> 04:59:21,670
We did Aratak before.

4927
04:59:27,050 --> 04:59:28,250
It is...

4928
04:59:29,630 --> 04:59:30,230
Paragon!

4929
04:59:30,230 --> 04:59:30,830
Paragon!

4930
04:59:34,250 --> 04:59:34,890
Yippee!

4931
04:59:35,530 --> 04:59:36,170
Paragon!

4932
04:59:40,730 --> 04:59:41,370
Paragon!

4933
04:59:41,510 --> 04:59:41,910
Paragon!

4934
04:59:46,610 --> 04:59:47,750
Oh my gosh.

4935
04:59:48,970 --> 04:59:51,150
Why are we getting like a cutscene of these guys?

4936
04:59:51,830 --> 04:59:54,410
I see.

4937
04:59:57,530 --> 04:59:59,050
Oh, that's a little freaky.

4938
04:59:59,190 --> 04:59:59,890
I don't like that.

4939
05:00:01,270 --> 05:00:02,750
I don't like that at all.

4940
05:00:02,950 --> 05:00:04,390
Reveal invisible...

4941
05:00:05,210 --> 05:00:06,130
Were they blue?

4942
05:00:17,650 --> 05:00:19,750
Maybe I can do... Oh no, that would make me invisible.

4943
05:00:23,710 --> 05:00:24,870
Just blast the room?

4944
05:00:25,030 --> 05:00:25,870
Actually, you know what?

4945
05:00:25,870 --> 05:00:27,370
That might be a good way to do it.

4946
05:00:28,090 --> 05:00:29,130
It's damage field, right?

4947
05:00:29,210 --> 05:00:29,570
Let me check.

4948
05:00:32,750 --> 05:00:33,470
Mystical power...

4949
05:00:33,470 --> 05:00:33,990
Oh no, no.

4950
05:00:37,770 --> 05:00:38,190
Wait...

4951
05:00:42,730 --> 05:00:43,150
Magic...

4952
05:00:43,750 --> 05:00:44,490
No, no, no.

4953
05:00:44,590 --> 05:00:45,010
That's stupid.

4954
05:00:45,250 --> 05:00:45,650
No, no, no.

4955
05:00:45,750 --> 05:00:46,170
I'm stupid.

4956
05:00:47,790 --> 05:00:48,630
Summon chopper...

4957
05:00:48,630 --> 05:00:49,230
Magical attack!

4958
05:00:49,290 --> 05:00:49,690
There it is.

4959
05:00:51,070 --> 05:00:52,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4960
05:00:53,170 --> 05:00:55,870
I'm just gonna cast it...

4961
05:00:55,870 --> 05:00:56,490
Big boy...

4962
05:00:58,010 --> 05:00:58,430
Purple.

4963
05:01:17,810 --> 05:01:19,290
I don't think that worked.

4964
05:01:21,310 --> 05:01:24,150
I don't think that worked.

4965
05:01:25,010 --> 05:01:27,050
Maybe I have to reveal invisible.

4966
05:01:27,270 --> 05:01:27,690
Let's see.

4967
05:01:28,530 --> 05:01:29,050
What is it?

4968
05:01:35,120 --> 05:01:36,760
I don't know what color they were.

4969
05:01:36,880 --> 05:01:37,160
I didn't see.

4970
05:01:37,220 --> 05:01:38,180
But the room is blue.

4971
05:01:39,020 --> 05:01:41,060
So if the room is blue, let's try green.

4972
05:01:45,620 --> 05:01:46,500
I think...

4973
05:01:53,540 --> 05:01:54,420
I don't...

4974
05:02:01,240 --> 05:02:02,200
Think so...

4975
05:02:06,880 --> 05:02:08,060
Oh gosh, I'm scared.

4976
05:02:08,860 --> 05:02:09,620
I'm scared.

4977
05:02:09,940 --> 05:02:10,780
They're like right on me.

4978
05:02:11,260 --> 05:02:12,280
What if they're right here?

4979
05:02:13,080 --> 05:02:14,300
What if they're right here?

4980
05:02:14,560 --> 05:02:15,500
Can I still shoot them?

4981
05:02:20,980 --> 05:02:21,460
No.

4982
05:02:22,560 --> 05:02:23,780
Oh, now they noticed me.

4983
05:02:25,140 --> 05:02:26,940
Now they're all... I triggered them.

4984
05:02:26,940 --> 05:02:27,320
Ah!

4985
05:02:35,540 --> 05:02:36,980
Maybe let's just try red.

4986
05:02:52,730 --> 05:02:53,250
Oh.

4987
05:02:55,430 --> 05:02:56,910
Did not one shot them.

4988
05:02:57,190 --> 05:02:58,750
I think I...

4989
05:02:58,750 --> 05:02:59,290
There we go.

4990
05:03:02,810 --> 05:03:04,650
And you... I'm just gonna get...

4991
05:03:04,650 --> 05:03:05,430
Take them all down.

4992
05:03:07,670 --> 05:03:09,070
Take them all out.

4993
05:03:09,070 --> 05:03:09,170
Take them all out.

4994
05:03:12,310 --> 05:03:14,430
Oh my god, they're so annoying.

4995
05:03:15,810 --> 05:03:16,970
Oh my god, please.

4996
05:03:17,390 --> 05:03:18,010
Shut up.

4997
05:03:26,540 --> 05:03:28,560
Honestly, these guys are so easy to kill though.

4998
05:03:28,700 --> 05:03:32,520
So I don't mind that this entire place is just infested with trappers.

4999
05:03:32,740 --> 05:03:33,040
Honestly.

5000
05:03:33,880 --> 05:03:34,560
I'm like, you know what?

5001
05:03:35,000 --> 05:03:35,380
Yeah.

5002
05:03:36,380 --> 05:03:37,540
Let it just be them.

5003
05:03:38,460 --> 05:03:40,640
I don't... It doesn't need to be anybody else either.

5004
05:03:41,380 --> 05:03:42,300
Wait, how do I get out of here?

5005
05:03:43,480 --> 05:03:45,360
Was it the door around here?

5006
05:03:48,910 --> 05:03:50,390
I believe so, yeah.

5007
05:03:53,130 --> 05:03:53,610
Okay.

5008
05:03:54,790 --> 05:03:56,130
They're kind of like cicadas.

5009
05:03:56,610 --> 05:03:58,890
Me, me, me, me, me.

5010
05:03:58,890 --> 05:03:59,990
Me, me, me, me.

5011
05:04:01,850 --> 05:04:03,090
Could have been the wing guys.

5012
05:04:03,190 --> 05:04:04,450
I know, they actually...

5013
05:04:06,710 --> 05:04:08,070
This is just kind of...

5014
05:04:08,070 --> 05:04:09,430
It's only a little tedious.

5015
05:04:09,970 --> 05:04:11,050
But it's not difficult.

5016
05:04:11,550 --> 05:04:14,350
And I actually don't mind that there's more...

5017
05:04:14,350 --> 05:04:16,590
That they're more puzzle-like than combat.

5018
05:04:17,290 --> 05:04:18,550
I think that's more fun.

5019
05:04:19,870 --> 05:04:20,270
You know?

5020
05:04:20,430 --> 05:04:22,610
I gotta use my brains a little bit.

5021
05:04:23,570 --> 05:04:26,130
I gotta use my brains a little bit.

5022
05:04:27,530 --> 05:04:29,090
I'll save before the next room.

5023
05:04:34,210 --> 05:04:35,250
Tensai Ghost!

5024
05:04:39,380 --> 05:04:39,900
Pargon?

5025
05:04:40,960 --> 05:04:42,280
Pargon, pargon.

5026
05:04:43,200 --> 05:04:44,920
Alright guys, you wanna bet this time?

5027
05:04:46,220 --> 05:04:48,020
You wanna bet if it's pargon or not?

5028
05:04:48,640 --> 05:04:49,800
Tear or pargon?

5029
05:04:57,330 --> 05:04:59,430
Not pargon, not pargon.

5030
05:05:06,090 --> 05:05:08,010
Tear this time, alright.

5031
05:05:08,750 --> 05:05:09,450
Let's see!

5032
05:05:11,010 --> 05:05:12,650
It was pargon!

5033
05:05:12,650 --> 05:05:15,290
You guys all owe me!

5034
05:05:16,690 --> 05:05:18,070
12k on tear.

5035
05:05:19,910 --> 05:05:21,110
It was pargon!

5036
05:05:21,490 --> 05:05:23,180
All the non-pargon believers...

5037
05:05:24,030 --> 05:05:25,150
Out of the chat...

5038
05:05:25,790 --> 05:05:27,150
You owe me...

5039
05:05:37,880 --> 05:05:39,570
A funny dance.

5040
05:05:47,880 --> 05:05:48,640
Okay...

5041
05:05:50,520 --> 05:05:51,280
Okay...

5042
05:05:53,000 --> 05:05:53,760
Okay...

5043
05:05:53,760 --> 05:05:55,040
It's so ominous.

5044
05:05:56,640 --> 05:05:59,860
Is this like when I just destroyed it before?

5045
05:06:01,980 --> 05:06:03,300
Lost the bet.

5046
05:06:05,360 --> 05:06:06,780
Oh yeah, wait.

5047
05:06:07,160 --> 05:06:10,520
I wonder...

5048
05:06:14,510 --> 05:06:15,490
What's happening?

5049
05:06:15,490 --> 05:06:16,070
What's happening?

5050
05:06:17,710 --> 05:06:18,710
What's going on?

5051
05:06:19,970 --> 05:06:20,870
What's happening?

5052
05:06:22,250 --> 05:06:22,790
What's happening?

5053
05:06:28,070 --> 05:06:29,050
In front of me!

5054
05:06:39,820 --> 05:06:41,160
This works now though.

5055
05:06:43,540 --> 05:06:46,420
It only doesn't work on the trappers for some reason.

5056
05:06:47,660 --> 05:06:49,360
But it worked on this guy.

5057
05:06:50,200 --> 05:06:50,760
Okay...

5058
05:07:01,840 --> 05:07:03,560
It's Zelda, for real.

5059
05:07:05,180 --> 05:07:08,660
I thought about playing the new Zelda game.

5060
05:07:09,900 --> 05:07:11,500
Wait, let's do a little bit away.

5061
05:07:11,500 --> 05:07:11,680
Let's do a little bit away.

5062
05:07:25,470 --> 05:07:27,850
Why don't we get a cutscene for this one?

5063
05:07:36,770 --> 05:07:39,110
He didn't even get to finish emoting.

5064
05:07:40,330 --> 05:07:41,750
And we took him down.

5065
05:07:46,900 --> 05:07:48,680
So easy.

5066
05:07:49,940 --> 05:07:52,400
Alright, now water.

5067
05:07:54,480 --> 05:07:56,460
Alright, this one will probably be the toughest.

5068
05:08:01,680 --> 05:08:03,960
There we go.

5069
05:08:06,600 --> 05:08:07,640
Alright.

5070
05:08:07,640 --> 05:08:07,800
Alright.

5071
05:08:16,830 --> 05:08:17,550
I'm ready!

5072
05:08:29,310 --> 05:08:31,610
Oh my gosh, this sword is awesome!

5073
05:08:32,210 --> 05:08:32,490
Yeah!

5074
05:08:40,150 --> 05:08:43,290
It's so pitch black on my phone, I don't even know what I'm seeing on my screen.

5075
05:08:44,130 --> 05:08:45,670
Maybe adjust your brightness.

5076
05:08:46,370 --> 05:08:48,210
I don't think I can turn the brightness up anymore.

5077
05:08:48,210 --> 05:08:49,050
Oh, maybe I can.

5078
05:08:51,250 --> 05:08:51,890
Brighter.

5079
05:08:54,010 --> 05:08:56,030
Wait, did I just not save it?

5080
05:08:58,970 --> 05:08:59,930
No, I did.

5081
05:09:04,470 --> 05:09:06,130
Oh, wait a second.

5082
05:09:06,890 --> 05:09:08,470
Is there something else?

5083
05:09:14,740 --> 05:09:17,200
And yet the barrier remains.

5084
05:09:22,820 --> 05:09:24,820
Did I do all that for nothing?

5085
05:09:31,040 --> 05:09:31,720
Do

5086
05:09:39,420 --> 05:09:41,700
I have to...

5087
05:09:41,700 --> 05:09:44,220
I wonder if purple would work like a purple spell.

5088
05:09:46,400 --> 05:09:48,600
But obviously I need to attack them.

5089
05:09:49,000 --> 05:09:49,800
So magical attack...

5090
05:09:58,260 --> 05:09:58,940
Cast...

5091
05:09:58,940 --> 05:09:59,740
Purple.

5092
05:10:03,340 --> 05:10:05,000
Destroy the whole place!

5093
05:10:16,530 --> 05:10:17,650
Bye bye.

5094
05:10:24,110 --> 05:10:26,350
We took down the whole building basically.

5095
05:10:26,690 --> 05:10:27,790
Alrighty, where are we?

5096
05:10:27,870 --> 05:10:28,950
We are in this room.

5097
05:10:29,430 --> 05:10:30,610
So we need to go up here.

5098
05:10:31,670 --> 05:10:31,970
Okay.

5099
05:10:32,970 --> 05:10:34,430
Alright guys, just a few more.

5100
05:10:35,830 --> 05:10:37,650
VTuber, use your ult!

5101
05:10:38,770 --> 05:10:40,050
Just a few more.

5102
05:10:42,010 --> 05:10:43,590
But I think like...

5103
05:10:43,590 --> 05:10:43,830
Three more?

5104
05:10:48,460 --> 05:10:49,060
Run!

5105
05:10:53,200 --> 05:10:55,220
Oh, they are color-coded now.

5106
05:10:55,260 --> 05:10:55,840
Do you see that?

5107
05:10:56,340 --> 05:10:58,320
Like blue and orange and green.

5108
05:11:05,740 --> 05:11:06,600
Oh, two more.

5109
05:11:14,640 --> 05:11:17,220
I don't think this one is Paragon, you guys.

5110
05:11:18,200 --> 05:11:19,500
I don't think this one is Paragon.

5111
05:11:21,700 --> 05:11:22,580
I'm using...

5112
05:11:23,340 --> 05:11:24,940
This is an educated guess.

5113
05:11:24,980 --> 05:11:26,120
This is my hypothesis.

5114
05:11:28,540 --> 05:11:29,700
My hypothesis is...

5115
05:11:31,340 --> 05:11:32,620
This is not Paragon.

5116
05:11:33,540 --> 05:11:34,400
But what if it is?

5117
05:11:36,800 --> 05:11:37,160
Believe.

5118
05:11:39,620 --> 05:11:40,800
Not Paragon.

5119
05:11:42,940 --> 05:11:43,660
Tear!

5120
05:11:46,420 --> 05:11:49,500
What if you put in the wrong spell?

5121
05:11:51,180 --> 05:11:52,900
Do you get like a dumb ending?

5122
05:11:56,080 --> 05:11:57,640
I forgot to save.

5123
05:11:59,680 --> 05:12:01,020
But maybe we are okay.

5124
05:12:01,940 --> 05:12:04,120
Oh, a huge stone block etched with...

5125
05:12:04,120 --> 05:12:04,940
Barrier?

5126
05:12:05,220 --> 05:12:05,600
Oh, sorry.

5127
05:12:05,800 --> 05:12:07,560
Bizarre etchings dominates the room.

5128
05:12:07,900 --> 05:12:08,600
Is it art?

5129
05:12:08,960 --> 05:12:09,460
A memorial?

5130
05:12:09,840 --> 05:12:11,160
A tomb of the original inhabitants?

5131
05:12:11,560 --> 05:12:16,060
Or a bastardized internment of its loathsome conquerors?

5132
05:12:17,120 --> 05:12:18,420
Another piss room.

5133
05:12:20,220 --> 05:12:21,020
Oh, you can't?

5134
05:12:22,700 --> 05:12:23,640
Okay, hold on.

5135
05:12:23,740 --> 05:12:24,320
Where is the exit?

5136
05:12:34,640 --> 05:12:35,660
Dispel magic!

5137
05:12:36,920 --> 05:12:37,480
Fire!

5138
05:12:50,230 --> 05:12:52,290
I heard some guys though.

5139
05:12:52,430 --> 05:12:53,330
Where are they?

5140
05:12:54,870 --> 05:12:55,710
You hear them, right?

5141
05:12:56,510 --> 05:12:57,270
Where are they?

5142
05:13:18,760 --> 05:13:20,200
Is this the exit?

5143
05:13:21,620 --> 05:13:22,000
Yeah!

5144
05:13:24,720 --> 05:13:25,280
Easy!

5145
05:13:26,880 --> 05:13:27,320
Alrighty.

5146
05:13:30,020 --> 05:13:30,920
Alrighty, here we go.

5147
05:13:32,340 --> 05:13:34,880
I'm just gonna...I think I'm just gonna run for it.

5148
05:13:35,080 --> 05:13:36,280
Wait, how many times did it get zapped?

5149
05:13:36,580 --> 05:13:37,240
Two times?

5150
05:13:38,880 --> 05:13:39,800
I should be fine.

5151
05:13:42,660 --> 05:13:44,040
If I'm speedy.

5152
05:13:44,560 --> 05:13:45,000
Speed!

5153
05:13:45,840 --> 05:13:46,200
Go!

5154
05:13:47,060 --> 05:13:47,400
Uh-oh.

5155
05:13:47,490 --> 05:13:48,060
Uh-oh.

5156
05:13:56,670 --> 05:13:58,680
Told you guys.

5157
05:13:58,920 --> 05:14:00,240
Have more faith in Minto.

5158
05:14:01,000 --> 05:14:02,700
Have more faith in Minto.

5159
05:14:03,860 --> 05:14:06,000
Gosh, you guys.

5160
05:14:06,580 --> 05:14:07,980
Last Pargon!

5161
05:14:08,660 --> 05:14:10,920
The final Pargon, you guys!

5162
05:14:11,420 --> 05:14:13,440
The last one is Pargon.

5163
05:14:13,440 --> 05:14:13,600
Pargon!

5164
05:14:17,500 --> 05:14:18,620
Title drop!

5165
05:14:18,800 --> 05:14:19,600
Title drop!

5166
05:14:19,920 --> 05:14:20,820
Title drop!

5167
05:14:20,920 --> 05:14:21,520
Title drop!

5168
05:14:41,110 --> 05:14:42,410
Oh my god.

5169
05:14:45,800 --> 05:14:47,040
Who are we summoning?

5170
05:14:52,710 --> 05:14:55,030
Am I the...am I...

5171
05:14:56,910 --> 05:14:59,870
Just cause I don't want to go through that cutscene again.

5172
05:15:03,690 --> 05:15:05,050
Here we go!

5173
05:15:15,630 --> 05:15:19,190
You are your last gone, Mismade Channel.

5174
05:15:22,710 --> 05:15:24,690
I have to make one of them my friend.

5175
05:15:26,710 --> 05:15:28,890
I have to...which one is the strongest one?

5176
05:15:38,780 --> 05:15:40,440
Become my friend.

5177
05:15:41,120 --> 05:15:42,320
Become my friend.

5178
05:15:46,480 --> 05:15:49,800
I don't think I get to choose, which is really stinky.

5179
05:15:54,000 --> 05:15:54,820
Yeah!

5180
05:15:55,080 --> 05:15:55,580
Fight!

5181
05:15:55,800 --> 05:15:56,260
Fight!

5182
05:15:56,460 --> 05:15:56,900
Fight!

5183
05:15:57,660 --> 05:16:00,120
Wait, he is already dead?

5184
05:16:03,990 --> 05:16:07,380
I think we chose the wrong one.

5185
05:16:10,140 --> 05:16:12,220
One more time!

5186
05:16:13,100 --> 05:16:13,920
Fight!

5187
05:16:14,140 --> 05:16:14,380
Fight!

5188
05:16:14,680 --> 05:16:15,000
Fight!

5189
05:16:20,980 --> 05:16:21,800
Yeah!

5190
05:16:22,040 --> 05:16:22,240
Fight!

5191
05:16:22,460 --> 05:16:22,460
Fight!

5192
05:16:22,620 --> 05:16:22,880
Fight!

5193
05:16:22,880 --> 05:16:24,580
My guy is the strongest.

5194
05:16:25,200 --> 05:16:26,460
My guy is the strongest.

5195
05:16:27,220 --> 05:16:28,820
My guy is gonna get...

5196
05:16:28,820 --> 05:16:29,120
No!

5197
05:16:30,880 --> 05:16:32,460
He is gonna get his ass whipped.

5198
05:16:32,860 --> 05:16:33,160
No!

5199
05:16:43,860 --> 05:16:45,700
It's okay, I killed him anyway.

5200
05:16:52,200 --> 05:16:52,840
Nice.

5201
05:16:54,140 --> 05:16:54,940
Is there anything over here?

5202
05:16:55,960 --> 05:16:56,520
Just checking.

5203
05:16:57,060 --> 05:16:57,560
Nope.

5204
05:17:01,570 --> 05:17:02,690
Real dead.

5205
05:17:03,190 --> 05:17:04,610
Really, really dead.

5206
05:17:05,170 --> 05:17:05,850
Oh yeah.

5207
05:17:06,770 --> 05:17:07,370
Okay.

5208
05:17:08,790 --> 05:17:09,270
Oh wait.

5209
05:17:09,950 --> 05:17:10,790
Sorry Alex.

5210
05:17:11,970 --> 05:17:13,490
Making her super sleepy.

5211
05:17:18,610 --> 05:17:19,210
Okay.

5212
05:17:24,520 --> 05:17:25,840
Mint cannot aim.

5213
05:17:25,900 --> 05:17:27,040
What are you talking about?

5214
05:17:27,120 --> 05:17:28,620
Why are you being so mean to me?

5215
05:17:29,160 --> 05:17:30,400
Don't be rude.

5216
05:17:30,980 --> 05:17:32,300
What are you talking about?

5217
05:17:32,380 --> 05:17:32,980
I can't aim.

5218
05:17:35,040 --> 05:17:37,320
There is an Easter egg for Mount to Rock summon.

5219
05:17:37,720 --> 05:17:38,060
Really?

5220
05:17:48,040 --> 05:17:49,480
How do I see it?

5221
05:17:55,690 --> 05:17:56,590
Bad, that guy.

5222
05:17:57,570 --> 05:17:58,290
I'm benevolent.

5223
05:18:08,750 --> 05:18:09,410
Wait a second.

5224
05:18:09,550 --> 05:18:10,850
Isn't this the room I was just in?

5225
05:18:12,270 --> 05:18:13,890
Oh wait, the exit is on the other side.

5226
05:18:14,370 --> 05:18:17,110
I think.

5227
05:18:18,230 --> 05:18:18,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5228
05:18:28,750 --> 05:18:29,130
Nice.

5229
05:18:30,570 --> 05:18:32,030
We made it.

5230
05:18:32,970 --> 05:18:35,650
And one last P floor hopefully.

5231
05:18:36,690 --> 05:18:37,310
Hopefully.

5232
05:18:38,650 --> 05:18:39,470
More P floor.

5233
05:18:39,750 --> 05:18:40,130
No!

5234
05:18:40,870 --> 05:18:42,150
One last.

5235
05:18:42,510 --> 05:18:43,210
Hopefully.

5236
05:18:43,830 --> 05:18:45,070
Hopefully this is it guys.

5237
05:18:46,430 --> 05:18:48,330
We are so close to the end.

5238
05:18:48,390 --> 05:18:49,070
Oh it's purple!

5239
05:19:01,060 --> 05:19:02,180
Here we go.

5240
05:19:05,860 --> 05:19:06,960
Here we go.

5241
05:19:22,500 --> 05:19:23,920
Here we go.

5242
05:19:24,180 --> 05:19:24,360
Wait.

5243
05:19:24,880 --> 05:19:26,260
Would you like to save?

5244
05:19:26,340 --> 05:19:26,760
Oh yeah.

5245
05:19:27,880 --> 05:19:29,580
I would like to save.

5246
05:19:29,660 --> 05:19:30,080
Thank you.

5247
05:19:30,080 --> 05:19:31,100
I'm going to save right there.

5248
05:19:32,880 --> 05:19:33,980
Here we go!

5249
05:19:43,620 --> 05:19:45,140
We are going to have to fight that guy.

5250
05:19:46,880 --> 05:19:47,320
Him!

5251
05:19:47,460 --> 05:19:47,680
You!

5252
05:19:59,360 --> 05:19:59,800
Pious!

5253
05:20:06,030 --> 05:20:06,680
M'lady.

5254
05:20:14,200 --> 05:20:14,860
Yeah.

5255
05:20:17,400 --> 05:20:18,820
You tell him Alex!

5256
05:20:29,860 --> 05:20:32,320
We never get to hear Alex talk.

5257
05:20:32,680 --> 05:20:33,460
So it's kind of awesome.

5258
05:20:34,840 --> 05:20:35,980
Go Alex!

5259
05:20:36,100 --> 05:20:36,420
Go!

5260
05:20:37,880 --> 05:20:39,520
I'm the guardian of light.

5261
05:20:47,520 --> 05:20:48,800
Uh oh.

5262
05:20:50,180 --> 05:20:51,980
Wait, where is my summon?

5263
05:20:52,940 --> 05:20:54,140
I did one too.

5264
05:20:55,440 --> 05:20:56,080
Where is my...

5265
05:20:57,900 --> 05:20:58,540
No!

5266
05:20:58,680 --> 05:20:59,420
He's fart hunting!

5267
05:21:05,640 --> 05:21:07,880
Miss Zealotas!

5268
05:21:08,260 --> 05:21:09,300
Oh my god.

5269
05:21:13,960 --> 05:21:16,000
Dance for us!

5270
05:21:16,940 --> 05:21:18,060
Wowee!

5271
05:21:26,180 --> 05:21:27,060
There's mine!

5272
05:21:27,440 --> 05:21:28,060
My summon!

5273
05:21:32,300 --> 05:21:32,860
Wood.

5274
05:21:36,060 --> 05:21:36,960
He's yawning.

5275
05:21:37,040 --> 05:21:37,500
He's sleeping.

5276
05:21:38,460 --> 05:21:38,860
Wake up!

5277
05:21:39,340 --> 05:21:40,600
It's time to fight a lady.

5278
05:21:44,020 --> 05:21:45,860
Why is it so quiet all of a sudden?

5279
05:22:02,880 --> 05:22:04,420
Oh, you got a shield?

5280
05:22:04,420 --> 05:22:06,280
I can shield too.

5281
05:22:08,140 --> 05:22:08,880
Uh oh.

5282
05:22:09,160 --> 05:22:09,460
Wait.

5283
05:22:13,120 --> 05:22:14,720
Yeah, dummy.

5284
05:22:18,510 --> 05:22:19,210
What the?

5285
05:22:21,130 --> 05:22:22,070
Oh no!

5286
05:22:22,250 --> 05:22:24,370
I have to go dispel your thing.

5287
05:22:26,110 --> 05:22:28,790
Yeah, I have to go dispel your thing.

5288
05:22:29,050 --> 05:22:29,370
Hold on.

5289
05:22:29,650 --> 05:22:30,090
Let me...

5290
05:22:30,090 --> 05:22:30,790
Hold on.

5291
05:22:31,330 --> 05:22:32,030
Let me up there.

5292
05:22:33,150 --> 05:22:33,890
Oh shoot.

5293
05:22:33,970 --> 05:22:35,250
Do I have to reveal it first?

5294
05:22:36,810 --> 05:22:37,890
Reveal invisible!

5295
05:22:38,790 --> 05:22:39,270
Wait.

5296
05:22:39,770 --> 05:22:41,530
It was a 5, wasn't it?

5297
05:22:54,160 --> 05:22:55,300
Wait, it disappeared.

5298
05:22:57,840 --> 05:22:59,040
Just attack it?

5299
05:22:59,440 --> 05:23:12,130
Oh my gosh.

5300
05:23:15,210 --> 05:23:15,870
Hey, come here.

5301
05:23:17,990 --> 05:23:18,770
I see it.

5302
05:23:18,810 --> 05:23:19,170
I see it.

5303
05:23:24,890 --> 05:23:25,710
The tome!

5304
05:23:26,610 --> 05:23:27,190
Oh my god.

5305
05:23:29,050 --> 05:23:29,490
My...

5306
05:23:31,730 --> 05:23:32,170
My...

5307
05:23:32,170 --> 05:23:33,190
Oh, I see it.

5308
05:23:33,690 --> 05:23:34,750
Oh shoot.

5309
05:23:34,890 --> 05:23:35,210
Oh shoot.

5310
05:23:35,310 --> 05:23:35,550
Oh shoot.

5311
05:23:37,930 --> 05:23:40,030
Maybe I should have...

5312
05:23:40,030 --> 05:23:40,930
Oh my gosh.

5313
05:23:42,730 --> 05:23:44,650
Maybe I should have...

5314
05:23:44,650 --> 05:23:45,270
Pooled.

5315
05:23:45,770 --> 05:23:46,270
Ah!

5316
05:23:50,210 --> 05:23:51,830
Oh my god.

5317
05:23:51,870 --> 05:23:52,770
They are all coming here.

5318
05:23:53,570 --> 05:23:54,750
Oh my god!

5319
05:23:56,450 --> 05:23:57,130
What the?

5320
05:23:58,590 --> 05:24:00,770
What is going on?

5321
05:24:01,430 --> 05:24:02,270
What is going on?

5322
05:24:04,010 --> 05:24:05,090
Pick up the tome.

5323
05:24:05,830 --> 05:24:06,850
I'm her!

5324
05:24:10,670 --> 05:24:11,430
What?

5325
05:24:13,370 --> 05:24:15,630
Wait, I don't have the cool sword anymore.

5326
05:24:18,170 --> 05:24:19,550
I don't have my good sword anymore.

5327
05:24:22,050 --> 05:24:23,050
I'm Alex again?

5328
05:24:24,710 --> 05:24:25,250
Uh oh.

5329
05:24:26,350 --> 05:24:27,570
It's taking a lot out of me.

5330
05:24:42,440 --> 05:24:44,140
Do I have enough time?

5331
05:24:50,380 --> 05:24:52,140
Quick 3 point magic pool?

5332
05:24:52,660 --> 05:24:54,740
I think it might be best just to recover some.

5333
05:25:01,260 --> 05:25:01,840
Ah!

5334
05:25:04,380 --> 05:25:05,100
Uh oh.

5335
05:25:05,480 --> 05:25:06,540
It didn't work you guys.

5336
05:25:06,800 --> 05:25:07,520
We messed up.

5337
05:25:07,800 --> 05:25:08,740
We are too slow now.

5338
05:25:09,340 --> 05:25:10,000
Oh shoot.

5339
05:25:12,500 --> 05:25:13,300
Oh my god.

5340
05:25:13,340 --> 05:25:14,360
He is so fast.

5341
05:25:23,820 --> 05:25:25,500
You told us of your disability.

5342
05:25:25,840 --> 05:25:27,040
What is happening?

5343
05:25:27,560 --> 05:25:28,760
What is going on?

5344
05:25:29,240 --> 05:25:29,940
It's here.

5345
05:25:30,220 --> 05:25:31,600
It worked!

5346
05:25:38,900 --> 05:25:41,920
Oh my gosh.

5347
05:25:42,280 --> 05:25:43,620
I need more.

5348
05:25:44,900 --> 05:25:46,440
Oh my god.

5349
05:25:46,500 --> 05:25:49,020
Oh my god.

5350
05:25:49,060 --> 05:25:49,720
Run Alex!

5351
05:26:04,730 --> 05:26:05,790
I'm Alex again?

5352
05:26:08,740 --> 05:26:09,140
Oh my god.

5353
05:26:09,320 --> 05:26:09,600
Run.

5354
05:26:12,160 --> 05:26:13,040
Where are Anthony?

5355
05:26:15,080 --> 05:26:16,540
It's all the way up there.

5356
05:26:18,180 --> 05:26:19,600
Go, go, go, go, go.

5357
05:26:20,580 --> 05:26:21,780
Go, go, go, go.

5358
05:26:21,920 --> 05:26:23,960
Stop being so tired please.

5359
05:26:24,240 --> 05:26:25,000
I know you are tired.

5360
05:26:25,380 --> 05:26:26,120
I know you are tired.

5361
05:26:26,200 --> 05:26:26,500
Me too.

5362
05:26:28,800 --> 05:26:29,560
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

5363
05:26:38,700 --> 05:26:39,500
Oh wait.

5364
05:26:39,500 --> 05:26:41,260
You don't attack him.

5365
05:26:41,360 --> 05:26:41,680
Dang it.

5366
05:26:41,740 --> 05:26:42,760
Oh I missed my chance.

5367
05:26:43,500 --> 05:26:44,020
Oh shoot.

5368
05:26:57,040 --> 05:26:57,660
Ouch.

5369
05:26:58,080 --> 05:27:00,720
What the...

5370
05:27:03,340 --> 05:27:04,120
Wait.

5371
05:27:04,280 --> 05:27:04,480
OK.

5372
05:27:04,520 --> 05:27:04,880
It's up here.

5373
05:27:07,240 --> 05:27:09,140
We are just casually walking.

5374
05:27:11,500 --> 05:27:13,640
Let me get a hidden.

5375
05:27:14,100 --> 05:27:17,540
It must be down here.

5376
05:27:18,840 --> 05:27:19,620
The simp.

5377
05:27:24,060 --> 05:27:25,320
Where is the simp?

5378
05:27:27,020 --> 05:27:28,220
Celebrating Christmas.

5379
05:27:32,260 --> 05:27:32,980
Back

5380
05:27:39,340 --> 05:27:40,580
to the kaiju fight!

5381
05:27:42,600 --> 05:27:43,320
OK.

5382
05:28:04,360 --> 05:28:05,180
Oh my god!

5383
05:28:06,780 --> 05:28:07,500
Maximillian!

5384
05:28:09,040 --> 05:28:10,680
Go, go, go, go, go.

5385
05:28:10,820 --> 05:28:11,680
Go Maximillian, go.

5386
05:28:16,100 --> 05:28:17,260
That's Maximillian!

5387
05:28:22,230 --> 05:28:23,390
Go Maximillian!

5388
05:28:24,430 --> 05:28:26,000
That's my great great grandpa!

5389
05:28:27,890 --> 05:28:28,930
Oh no.

5390
05:28:40,310 --> 05:28:41,450
It's OK, it's OK.

5391
05:28:42,070 --> 05:28:42,910
It's OK, it's OK.

5392
05:28:43,510 --> 05:28:44,910
I know you are...

5393
05:28:45,730 --> 05:28:47,490
You are so weak right now.

5394
05:28:48,350 --> 05:28:49,190
Oh my gosh.

5395
05:28:49,230 --> 05:28:50,670
We are just running back and forth.

5396
05:28:52,490 --> 05:28:54,410
Just running back and forth.

5397
05:28:54,510 --> 05:28:54,830
There it is.

5398
05:28:55,810 --> 05:28:56,550
Run, run, run.

5399
05:28:59,950 --> 05:29:01,130
Oh my gosh.

5400
05:29:02,390 --> 05:29:03,670
I think we can kill him now.

5401
05:29:06,410 --> 05:29:06,710
Yeah!

5402
05:29:10,980 --> 05:29:11,560
Uh oh.

5403
05:29:12,800 --> 05:29:14,320
Did I summon the worst guy?

5404
05:29:16,360 --> 05:29:17,340
Nevermind, he is good.

5405
05:29:19,240 --> 05:29:19,700
Yeah.

5406
05:29:23,550 --> 05:29:24,870
He is sucking her up.

5407
05:29:33,470 --> 05:29:35,430
Oh my gosh.

5408
05:29:41,500 --> 05:29:44,970
Now it's a...

5409
05:29:51,930 --> 05:29:53,310
I don't know...

5410
05:29:53,310 --> 05:29:54,510
Will we even have time?

5411
05:29:56,050 --> 05:29:57,670
To be able to do all of this?

5412
05:30:00,290 --> 05:30:01,430
You don't need a spell just...

5413
05:30:02,350 --> 05:30:03,710
Oh, I thought it was... OK.

5414
05:30:18,090 --> 05:30:19,010
That was close.

5415
05:30:43,420 --> 05:30:44,900
Oh my gosh, you guys.

5416
05:30:45,320 --> 05:30:45,960
Holy shit.

5417
05:30:50,020 --> 05:30:51,200
Oh my gosh.

5418
05:30:51,580 --> 05:30:53,220
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

5419
05:30:54,200 --> 05:30:55,480
Oh no, no, no, no.

5420
05:30:55,480 --> 05:30:56,840
This is bad, this is bad, this is bad.

5421
05:30:57,440 --> 05:30:59,040
This is so bad, this is so bad.

5422
05:31:06,520 --> 05:31:08,340
Get eaten, Zealotath.

5423
05:31:11,700 --> 05:31:12,540
Wait, what?

5424
05:31:12,780 --> 05:31:13,540
We did it?

5425
05:31:13,880 --> 05:31:14,800
No way.

5426
05:31:15,740 --> 05:31:16,700
No way.

5427
05:31:21,000 --> 05:31:22,940
Oh my god, the clutch.

5428
05:31:24,120 --> 05:31:25,520
We clutched it so...

5429
05:31:30,660 --> 05:31:31,060
Yeah!

5430
05:31:47,880 --> 05:31:49,840
Oh my god, I really thought we were gonna die there.

5431
05:31:49,900 --> 05:31:50,860
That was crazy.

5432
05:31:52,000 --> 05:31:52,840
Great job, man.

5433
05:31:52,900 --> 05:31:54,420
Thank you so much for all your help, Riot.

5434
05:31:54,540 --> 05:31:55,560
I really appreciate it.

5435
05:31:56,780 --> 05:31:57,580
The wars.

5436
05:32:04,420 --> 05:32:06,200
But we saved Earth.

5437
05:32:15,900 --> 05:32:16,500
OK.

5438
05:32:17,920 --> 05:32:18,520
Bind.

5439
05:32:26,500 --> 05:32:28,540
I know that one by heart.

5440
05:32:34,160 --> 05:32:35,580
Grandpa, can I get a hint?

5441
05:32:36,320 --> 05:32:36,880
Grandpa.

5442
05:32:37,820 --> 05:32:39,960
I got the bark on Poki's neck.

5443
05:32:45,800 --> 05:32:46,760
I know.

5444
05:32:47,520 --> 05:32:48,320
Bind, bind.

5445
05:32:53,120 --> 05:32:55,120
I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick.

5446
05:32:55,540 --> 05:32:57,030
Is this a timed event or...

5447
05:33:01,920 --> 05:33:02,460
No,

5448
05:33:07,000 --> 05:33:08,320
I actually do have to pee.

5449
05:33:08,880 --> 05:33:09,340
I do.

5450
05:33:09,760 --> 05:33:11,040
I have to go to the little ghosties room.

5451
05:33:14,520 --> 05:33:17,520
Pious, your attention is impious, you are par gone.

5452
05:33:22,180 --> 05:33:23,700
Guys, I'll never get this.

5453
05:33:23,740 --> 05:33:24,760
I'll never get this right.

5454
05:33:25,180 --> 05:33:26,260
I'll never get this right.

5455
05:33:26,840 --> 05:33:28,000
I need help.

5456
05:33:28,420 --> 05:33:29,020
Phone a friend!

5457
05:33:31,260 --> 05:33:33,260
You guys, there are so many options.

5458
05:33:36,240 --> 05:33:36,680
Maybe...

5459
05:33:37,500 --> 05:33:38,860
What did I wake up to?

5460
05:33:52,260 --> 05:33:53,700
I'm looking it up.

5461
05:33:54,480 --> 05:33:55,220
Bind.

5462
05:33:56,080 --> 05:33:58,060
Eternal darkness.

5463
05:33:58,280 --> 05:34:02,340
Everybody knows that kids all look this up on GameFAQs when they were a kid.

5464
05:34:02,900 --> 05:34:03,180
Protect?

5465
05:34:03,720 --> 05:34:04,560
Thanks Rett!

5466
05:34:07,600 --> 05:34:09,640
What if I was wrong?

5467
05:34:10,660 --> 05:34:12,640
Wait, I'm actually curious.

5468
05:34:15,140 --> 05:34:16,280
What if he had been like...

5469
05:34:16,280 --> 05:34:16,960
No, no, no.

5470
05:34:17,260 --> 05:34:17,620
You dummy.

5471
05:34:18,040 --> 05:34:18,680
You stupid head.

5472
05:34:20,440 --> 05:34:21,440
Stupid dummy.

5473
05:34:23,620 --> 05:34:24,920
You got dookie for brains?

5474
05:34:26,620 --> 05:34:28,100
That's what he would have said to me.

5475
05:34:31,640 --> 05:34:32,640
Oh, really?

5476
05:34:34,740 --> 05:34:35,620
It is?

5477
05:34:36,120 --> 05:34:36,500
For now.

5478
05:34:36,500 --> 05:34:37,840
For now.

5479
05:34:42,020 --> 05:34:42,880
Grandpa.

5480
05:34:44,900 --> 05:34:45,780
Grandpa!

5481
05:34:46,900 --> 05:34:47,580
Grandpa!

5482
05:34:59,460 --> 05:35:01,220
Bye Grandpa.

5483
05:35:03,880 --> 05:35:04,360
No!

5484
05:35:05,140 --> 05:35:05,320
No!

5485
05:35:05,320 --> 05:35:06,820
She didn't even get to say anything to him.

5486
05:35:08,200 --> 05:35:08,540
Oh!

5487
05:35:09,220 --> 05:35:10,340
Thanks, I guess.

5488
05:35:31,220 --> 05:35:35,080
I think that once I could not see beyond the veil of reality.

5489
05:35:35,820 --> 05:35:38,700
To see those who dwell behind.

5490
05:35:40,000 --> 05:35:41,620
I was once a fool.

5491
05:35:47,480 --> 05:35:48,580
The end.

5492
05:35:49,200 --> 05:35:51,460
Dot, dot, dot, question mark?

5493
05:35:54,420 --> 05:35:54,940
Yay!

5494
05:35:59,460 --> 05:36:01,120
We beat it!

5495
05:36:03,150 --> 05:36:06,330
You've overcome the darkness!

5496
05:36:06,330 --> 05:36:10,330
That has prevailed for over two millennia.

5497
05:36:11,170 --> 05:36:13,590
This accomplishment will begin a new era for humanity.

5498
05:36:13,950 --> 05:36:17,330
Now, would you like to record this grand occasion in the pages of human history?

5499
05:36:17,730 --> 05:36:19,110
Yes, I would like to save.

5500
05:36:24,920 --> 05:36:25,480
Yeah.

5501
05:36:26,440 --> 05:36:28,120
In memory of Ben.

5502
05:36:29,100 --> 05:36:29,660
1920.

5503
05:36:33,680 --> 05:36:34,640
Is that it?

5504
05:36:37,480 --> 05:36:39,000
Oh my gosh!

5505
05:36:39,100 --> 05:36:40,380
Wait, is it his dad's?

5506
05:36:40,380 --> 05:36:42,740
The producer and director's dad?

5507
05:36:43,340 --> 05:36:44,680
One out of three done.

5508
05:36:46,660 --> 05:36:47,980
Oh my goodness.

5509
05:36:49,120 --> 05:36:51,360
This game is one of my nostalgic favorites.

5510
05:36:51,500 --> 05:36:52,360
Thank you for playing it.

5511
05:36:52,920 --> 05:36:55,060
To the end, and congrats on warding off the eternal darkness.

5518
05:37:09,460 --> 05:37:12,280
And I'd be like, it looks so scary.

5519
05:37:14,120 --> 05:37:14,720
And...

5520
05:37:15,700 --> 05:37:20,660
I'm finally glad that I could satiate my curiosity about it.

5521
05:37:21,140 --> 05:37:22,240
It's so awesome!

5522
05:37:22,520 --> 05:37:23,820
It's such a great game.

5523
05:37:24,860 --> 05:37:26,420
Now, two more times for the true ending.

5524
05:37:28,700 --> 05:37:29,900
How about...

5525
05:37:29,900 --> 05:37:30,240
No.

5526
05:37:30,760 --> 05:37:35,280
And how about we watch the true ending in a YouTube video?

5527
05:37:42,580 --> 05:37:43,620
Oh wow.

5528
05:37:52,180 --> 05:37:53,480
That's the mint way.

5529
05:37:53,840 --> 05:37:54,020
No.

5530
05:37:55,140 --> 05:37:57,280
I still really want to see the true end though.

5531
05:37:59,540 --> 05:38:01,540
But this is a YouTube video.

5532
05:38:03,240 --> 05:38:05,420
This is a YouTube livestream.

5533
05:38:06,780 --> 05:38:08,660
What do you mean you don't want to be Roberto again?

5534
05:38:08,660 --> 05:38:12,340
I feel like... I feel like though...

5535
05:38:12,340 --> 05:38:13,500
Well, actually, I don't know.

5536
05:38:14,100 --> 05:38:17,980
Towards the end, when you get all the different kinds of spells and everything, you...

5537
05:38:17,980 --> 05:38:18,880
Chris Zimmerman!

5538
05:38:20,600 --> 05:38:22,440
Voice talent director, yeah!

5539
05:38:22,560 --> 05:38:23,720
Chris Zimmerman, yeah!

5540
05:38:24,460 --> 05:38:25,960
That's the GOAT right there.

5541
05:38:26,080 --> 05:38:26,560
She's so awesome.

5542
05:38:26,660 --> 05:38:27,380
Oh, Gaglord!

5543
05:38:29,860 --> 05:38:31,800
I'm obsessed with taking more Rotopix.

5544
05:38:33,020 --> 05:38:34,340
I used to take Rotopix.

5545
05:38:34,400 --> 05:38:34,780
They're so fun.

5546
05:38:35,020 --> 05:38:35,880
Greg Eagles!

5547
05:38:37,220 --> 05:38:38,700
Richard Doyle, yeah!

5548
05:38:42,140 --> 05:38:43,240
Paul Eiding!

5549
05:38:45,260 --> 05:38:48,220
The three legends in one picture!

5550
05:38:50,460 --> 05:38:52,120
Oh my gosh.

5551
05:38:52,220 --> 05:38:52,940
Oh my gosh.

5552
05:38:53,140 --> 05:38:56,360
Oh my god.

5553
05:38:56,500 --> 05:39:00,740
David Hayter, Jennifer Hale, and Paul Eiding in the same slide.

5554
05:39:00,920 --> 05:39:01,360
They knew.

5555
05:39:01,360 --> 05:39:07,340
Chris Zimmerman, for those who don't know, Chris Zimmerman is the voice director for Metal Gear Solid too.

5556
05:39:07,600 --> 05:39:08,740
Metal Gear Solid also.

5557
05:39:11,740 --> 05:39:18,340
If she's on the team, I feel full confident that the voice, the acting will be incredible.

5558
05:39:25,740 --> 05:39:27,640
Have you played Cold Fear?

5559
05:39:27,780 --> 05:39:28,440
I have not.

5560
05:39:28,440 --> 05:39:29,140
I have not.

5561
05:39:30,740 --> 05:39:32,540
This game was so awesome.

5562
05:39:33,620 --> 05:39:40,820
It took, it definitely, it definitely can be a little, I don't want to say obtuse, but it can be quite a bit sometimes.

5563
05:39:43,620 --> 05:39:44,220
But...

5564
05:39:45,840 --> 05:39:46,440
It's...

5565
05:39:46,440 --> 05:39:47,780
It is...

5566
05:39:48,540 --> 05:39:50,380
Really, how do I say?

5567
05:39:56,340 --> 05:39:56,940
It's...

5568
05:39:57,600 --> 05:39:59,000
It is, don't worry.

5569
05:39:59,000 --> 05:40:01,060
Maybe obtuse is the right word.

5570
05:40:01,360 --> 05:40:04,080
I was going to say earlier, before I saw Chris Zimmerman.

5571
05:40:04,480 --> 05:40:08,100
I was going to say, I feel like I could probably beat it way faster now.

5572
05:40:08,220 --> 05:40:11,740
But then, you know, thinking about it, towards the end you get all the spells.

5573
05:40:11,860 --> 05:40:15,620
You feel so, like, you can do so much so quickly.

5574
05:40:16,320 --> 05:40:17,420
So, I don't know.

5575
05:40:18,320 --> 05:40:19,300
It's hard to say.

5576
05:40:19,760 --> 05:40:22,940
But also I wouldn't run around like a little chicken with my head cut off.

5577
05:40:24,780 --> 05:40:27,940
But it's such a good game, such a unique game.

5578
05:40:27,940 --> 05:40:30,280
So, oh my gosh.

5579
05:40:31,020 --> 05:40:32,200
So unique.

5580
05:40:33,400 --> 05:40:34,940
So creative, yeah.

5581
05:40:35,780 --> 05:40:37,860
You're OP when you know the spells, yeah.

5582
05:40:38,320 --> 05:40:43,860
Especially, you know, obviously thank you guys for helping me get Mantarok and the special...

5583
05:40:44,440 --> 05:40:47,640
The special sword as well.

5584
05:40:51,180 --> 05:40:52,980
Spell Royvus backwards.

5585
05:40:54,540 --> 05:40:55,340
Hold on.

5586
05:40:55,660 --> 05:40:56,360
S...

5587
05:40:56,360 --> 05:40:57,400
A...

5588
05:40:58,280 --> 05:40:58,640
V...

5589
05:40:58,640 --> 05:40:59,800
I'm looking at your tweet.

5590
05:41:01,240 --> 05:41:01,600
Sav...

5591
05:41:02,380 --> 05:41:02,740
Savoir.

5592
05:41:04,940 --> 05:41:06,100
Savoir, how fancy.

5593
05:41:11,280 --> 05:41:12,200
Coldfear is pretty good.

5594
05:41:12,300 --> 05:41:13,600
It's on PC, I highly recommend it.

5595
05:41:13,640 --> 05:41:14,580
Oh, check it out, thank you.

5596
05:41:15,300 --> 05:41:16,400
Neil Ross is in the game too.

5597
05:41:17,220 --> 05:41:19,860
I don't expect people to recognize him, but he was Sergeant Kelly in Doom 3.

5598
05:41:20,220 --> 05:41:22,180
And the Mayor of Midgar in Final Fantasy VII Remake.

5599
05:41:26,300 --> 05:41:26,660
Savoir.

5600
05:41:31,440 --> 05:41:32,400
Oh, Savio...

5601
05:41:42,300 --> 05:41:45,380
I was like, okay French, pop off.

5602
05:41:47,800 --> 05:41:48,280
Savior.

5603
05:41:50,400 --> 05:41:52,600
Oh gosh, how do I get out of the screen?

5604
05:41:52,760 --> 05:41:54,240
Thank you Nintendo, I get it.

5605
05:41:54,240 --> 05:41:54,680
Oh.

5606
05:41:56,200 --> 05:41:58,020
That's right guys, we are doing an endurance.

5607
05:41:58,380 --> 05:42:01,400
The other two endings, non-stop streams until we get the true ending.

5608
05:42:03,180 --> 05:42:04,600
This can't be happening.

5609
05:42:05,140 --> 05:42:07,720
Yeah, sanity effect me, completing the game.

5610
05:42:09,780 --> 05:42:11,540
With the other two endings in one go.

5611
05:42:13,000 --> 05:42:13,900
Mal de Savoir.

5612
05:42:20,390 --> 05:42:23,830
So when I play a new game plus...

5613
05:42:24,790 --> 05:42:25,870
Is that what I would have to play?

5614
05:42:25,870 --> 05:42:28,510
Well, I say new game plus, but...

5615
05:42:28,510 --> 05:42:30,370
So if I start a game...

5616
05:42:36,030 --> 05:42:40,310
Oh, you have previously completed Eternal Darkness Sanity's Requiem with the following alignments.

5617
05:42:40,610 --> 05:42:42,710
Zolototh, would you like to carry this information over...

5618
05:42:42,710 --> 05:42:44,990
Ah, so that's how it works.

5619
05:42:47,350 --> 05:42:47,610
Oh.

5620
05:42:49,330 --> 05:42:49,670
Oopsie.

5621
05:42:51,890 --> 05:42:52,490
No.

5622
05:42:53,810 --> 05:42:53,930
No!

5623
05:42:53,930 --> 05:42:54,150
No!

5624
05:42:55,830 --> 05:42:55,830
No!

5625
05:42:59,950 --> 05:43:01,210
Oh my God, Grandpa!

5626
05:43:06,810 --> 05:43:08,930
Hold on, I'm just going to turn off my...

5627
05:43:14,670 --> 05:43:16,630
I'm just going to turn off my GameCube.

5628
05:43:17,910 --> 05:43:19,950
Turn off the game console right now.

5629
05:43:24,550 --> 05:43:25,850
Okay, I've turned it off.

5630
05:43:32,660 --> 05:43:34,360
Let's check out... Hold on, let me...

5631
05:43:39,260 --> 05:43:40,760
Get my monitor.

5632
05:43:42,840 --> 05:43:43,300
Ready.

5633
05:43:45,220 --> 05:43:46,320
HDMI no signal.

5634
05:43:47,800 --> 05:43:51,200
Let's check out the true end and then I'm going to go eat dinner.

5635
05:43:51,260 --> 05:43:52,840
Because I'm hungry.

5636
05:43:53,320 --> 05:43:54,560
Bring us back to the maid cafe mint?

5637
05:43:54,720 --> 05:43:55,020
Okay!

5638
05:43:55,820 --> 05:43:56,560
Give me a second.

5639
05:44:01,780 --> 05:44:02,020
Oh.

5640
05:44:07,500 --> 05:44:08,980
I need both arms.

5641
05:44:09,780 --> 05:44:10,300
There we go.

5642
05:44:16,760 --> 05:44:19,320
It looks like I have like a par-gone beard now.

5643
05:44:21,220 --> 05:44:22,800
You guys like my par-gone beard?

5644
05:44:22,880 --> 05:44:24,380
Here, I'm going to make it a little bit bigger.

5645
05:44:25,300 --> 05:44:25,980
There we go.

5646
05:44:26,060 --> 05:44:27,000
That looks better.

5647
05:44:27,060 --> 05:44:27,520
That was better.

5648
05:44:29,300 --> 05:44:30,420
I'm so hyped for 3.0.

5649
05:44:30,520 --> 05:44:31,080
Me too!

5650
05:44:31,600 --> 05:44:34,460
Paius had two millennia of prep time and still lost.

5651
05:44:34,800 --> 05:44:39,160
They were like... I guess they said quickly, but I guess quick in like...

5652
05:44:39,620 --> 05:44:41,200
You know...

5653
05:44:41,200 --> 05:44:43,980
Celestial horror is like...

5654
05:44:43,980 --> 05:44:45,080
You know...

5655
05:44:46,000 --> 05:44:46,520
Way...

5656
05:44:47,500 --> 05:44:49,520
Longer, probably or something, you know?

5657
05:44:49,920 --> 05:44:52,620
Alright, true end, eternal darkness.

5658
05:44:54,080 --> 05:44:55,260
Let's check it out.

5659
05:44:57,940 --> 05:44:59,840
So, I'm guessing it's the special end?

5660
05:44:59,840 --> 05:45:01,380
Oh wait, true ending, Mantarok.

5661
05:45:01,540 --> 05:45:02,060
No, no.

5662
05:45:03,120 --> 05:45:03,760
Wait, Mantarok.

5663
05:45:03,800 --> 05:45:04,700
Wait, there's so many here.

5664
05:45:05,820 --> 05:45:07,060
Is this the special ending?

5665
05:45:07,160 --> 05:45:07,820
Is that what it is?

5666
05:45:10,740 --> 05:45:12,880
One second, let me see if there's any talking in these.

5667
05:45:15,020 --> 05:45:16,180
Oh, is it the epilogue?

5668
05:45:16,240 --> 05:45:17,040
Is that what it is?

5669
05:45:17,960 --> 05:45:19,860
The darkness vanquished epilogue?

5670
05:45:20,360 --> 05:45:21,340
True end, Mantarok.

5671
05:45:23,460 --> 05:45:25,180
Wait, I don't know which one to look at.

5672
05:45:27,700 --> 05:45:30,880
I don't know which one to check out.

5673
05:45:31,360 --> 05:45:32,400
Now I'm confused.

5674
05:45:34,960 --> 05:45:35,900
It's purple.

5675
05:45:36,300 --> 05:45:36,380
What?

5676
05:45:38,000 --> 05:45:39,500
No, it's not what I...

5677
05:45:40,200 --> 05:45:41,220
This one has...

5678
05:45:41,220 --> 05:45:43,600
This one has a final boss plus true end.

5679
05:45:44,060 --> 05:45:44,660
Let me see.

5680
05:45:44,740 --> 05:45:46,000
Okay, no one's talking in it.

5681
05:45:48,940 --> 05:45:49,720
Let's see.

5682
05:45:51,620 --> 05:45:53,140
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

5683
05:45:53,420 --> 05:45:53,700
Okay.

5684
05:45:53,700 --> 05:45:56,060
Okay, so let's just do this one.

5685
05:45:56,200 --> 05:45:57,640
Give me a second, let me set it up.

5686
05:46:03,040 --> 05:46:03,520
Here.

5687
05:46:16,670 --> 05:46:17,150
Here.

5688
05:46:18,370 --> 05:46:20,210
This is from Torvus Channel.

5689
05:46:20,350 --> 05:46:22,310
Thank you very much, Torvus, for...

5690
05:46:23,170 --> 05:46:24,430
for uploading this.

5691
05:46:24,510 --> 05:46:24,870
Oh my god.

5692
05:46:25,810 --> 05:46:27,470
I can't get this right.

5693
05:46:29,770 --> 05:46:30,250
Okay.

5694
05:46:34,280 --> 05:46:36,040
Okay, sorry for the bad crop.

5695
05:46:37,020 --> 05:46:37,460
There we go.

5696
05:46:37,680 --> 05:46:37,900
Okay.

5697
05:46:38,800 --> 05:46:39,120
Okay.

5698
05:46:40,480 --> 05:46:43,140
It's worth checking out some cutscenes of the other routes at some point too, Pius.

5699
05:46:43,240 --> 05:46:44,880
It's pretty different interactions with all three gods.

5700
05:46:45,160 --> 05:46:46,460
Yeah, I was thinking that.

5701
05:46:46,540 --> 05:46:48,160
I was like, wait, I want to know what Pius...

5702
05:46:48,160 --> 05:46:50,020
Like, how the other gods are and stuff, so...

5703
05:46:50,840 --> 05:46:53,180
Not today, obviously, but I'll check it out.

5704
05:46:56,660 --> 05:46:57,020
Goodbye.

5705
05:46:58,480 --> 05:46:59,400
Oh, there you go.

5706
05:46:59,440 --> 05:47:00,080
Now you can hear it.

5707
05:47:05,290 --> 05:47:06,650
I can stretch.

5708
05:47:07,810 --> 05:47:09,050
Purple.

5709
05:47:37,510 --> 05:47:38,250
Title drop.

5710
05:47:43,730 --> 05:47:45,530
Oh, I can see their mouths.

5711
05:47:51,310 --> 05:47:53,730
It's so dark, I can barely see anything.

5712
05:47:56,230 --> 05:47:56,690
Chaturga!

5713
05:47:58,510 --> 05:47:59,410
We saw that!

5714
05:47:59,510 --> 05:47:59,910
We saw that!

5715
05:47:59,950 --> 05:48:00,490
We saw that!

5716
05:48:04,090 --> 05:48:05,410
We didn't see that.

5717
05:48:05,870 --> 05:48:06,670
We didn't see that.

5718
05:48:06,790 --> 05:48:07,550
Cover it with my mouth.

5719
05:48:08,670 --> 05:48:09,150
My mouth.

5720
05:48:11,350 --> 05:48:13,650
Goodbye, Chaturga.

5721
05:48:17,290 --> 05:48:18,750
Mantorok in the cave.

5722
05:48:20,270 --> 05:48:21,250
I love Mantorok.

5723
05:48:21,290 --> 05:48:21,890
He's so chill.

5724
05:48:25,230 --> 05:48:27,570
He's just chilling down there in the ruins.

5725
05:48:32,430 --> 05:48:32,730
No!

5726
05:48:34,230 --> 05:48:36,290
No, don't die, Mantorok!

5727
05:48:38,670 --> 05:48:40,090
Warden of Ancients.

5728
05:48:40,610 --> 05:48:44,090
Chaos, an entity trapped between the veils of reality.

5729
05:48:44,330 --> 05:48:47,890
And the enchanted stakes that impale its flesh.

5730
05:48:48,610 --> 05:48:51,090
Look at his face.

5731
05:48:51,470 --> 05:48:53,350
Unable to rally its guardians.

5732
05:48:54,690 --> 05:48:57,710
It could rely only on its subtle manipulations...

5733
05:48:57,710 --> 05:48:58,910
Big ol' googly eyes right here.

5734
05:48:58,930 --> 05:49:00,150
...to destroy its enemies.

5735
05:49:01,770 --> 05:49:07,570
Knowing the nature of the Ancients, it used its pawns to play them against each other.

5736
05:49:08,670 --> 05:49:11,870
Resulting in their mutual annihilation.

5737
05:49:14,190 --> 05:49:16,850
Now, it will languish forever.

5738
05:49:18,130 --> 05:49:19,610
Vestring in its tomb.

5739
05:49:20,930 --> 05:49:21,510
Plotting.

5740
05:49:26,360 --> 05:49:29,400
I feel like...OK, now it just says that.

5741
05:49:29,460 --> 05:49:30,240
You've overcome the darkness.

5742
05:49:31,180 --> 05:49:35,860
I feel like that really opens up for an Eternal Darkness 2, does it not?

5743
05:49:35,860 --> 05:49:37,840
A sequel bait.

5744
05:49:37,980 --> 05:49:39,920
Yeah, that really opened it up.

5745
05:49:40,500 --> 05:49:41,220
Interesting.

5746
05:49:47,810 --> 05:49:48,530
Plotting.

5747
05:49:49,530 --> 05:49:51,210
Plotting, plotting, plotting.

5748
05:49:52,510 --> 05:49:53,530
Okey-dokey.

5749
05:49:55,950 --> 05:49:56,910
One second.

5750
05:49:58,130 --> 05:50:00,510
Let's put on some music real quick.

5751
05:50:01,410 --> 05:50:03,090
And then I'm gonna...

5752
05:50:08,490 --> 05:50:08,810
Yay!

5753
05:50:09,690 --> 05:50:11,370
Always wanted to play the game, but never got the chance.

5754
05:50:11,490 --> 05:50:12,910
Glad I got to experience it with you in chat.

5755
05:50:12,990 --> 05:50:13,430
Great job, Minto!

5756
05:50:13,570 --> 05:50:14,170
Thank you!

5757
05:50:17,810 --> 05:50:20,470
Too bad that...yeah, I guess there will never be...

5758
05:50:22,130 --> 05:50:23,330
...a second game.

5759
05:50:23,690 --> 05:50:26,150
I mean, Silicon Knights is not around anymore.

5760
05:50:26,890 --> 05:50:28,470
Unless there was like a...

5761
05:50:30,390 --> 05:50:31,170
...successor, I don't know.

5762
05:50:31,930 --> 05:50:32,750
Thanks for the stream!

5763
05:50:32,850 --> 05:50:33,310
Thank you!

5764
05:50:35,710 --> 05:50:37,130
Kind of a bummer, right?

5765
05:50:38,210 --> 05:50:39,410
Yeah, it is good on its own.

5766
05:50:41,430 --> 05:50:43,390
Can you imagine, though, what kind of...

5767
05:50:47,430 --> 05:50:47,910
Actually...

5768
05:50:47,910 --> 05:50:50,430
I don't know, I feel like...

5769
05:50:50,430 --> 05:50:53,390
...the sanity effects, some of them would probably look cheesy.

5770
05:50:55,350 --> 05:50:57,770
Like, old games like that...

5771
05:50:57,770 --> 05:51:01,030
You know, especially when you're playing it on a CRT or something.

5772
05:51:01,030 --> 05:51:02,690
You're playing it on a...

5773
05:51:02,690 --> 05:51:07,810
Nowadays we have such good monitors and screens and stuff that...

5774
05:51:07,810 --> 05:51:08,970
...things are too crisp.

5775
05:51:09,710 --> 05:51:13,270
But on an old TV, especially some of the sanity effects...

5776
05:51:13,270 --> 05:51:15,490
...like when the flies were on the screen and stuff like that...

5777
05:51:15,490 --> 05:51:18,090
...it looked so good, you know?

5778
05:51:20,010 --> 05:51:24,270
Especially if I were playing it on a worse TV...

5779
05:51:24,270 --> 05:51:26,950
...it would look really realistic and stuff.

5780
05:51:28,010 --> 05:51:28,450
So...

5781
05:51:30,170 --> 05:51:31,950
I can imagine...

5782
05:51:32,710 --> 05:51:35,010
Did you see the sanity effect that erases your memory card?

5783
05:51:35,770 --> 05:51:36,670
Wait, does it actually?

5784
05:51:37,930 --> 05:51:39,790
Does it actually erase your memory card?

5785
05:51:40,350 --> 05:51:41,530
Because no, I did not.

5786
05:51:43,410 --> 05:51:44,210
It does?

5787
05:51:44,590 --> 05:51:45,690
Oh, it pretends to.

5788
05:51:46,250 --> 05:51:50,970
Yeah, there's a lot of sanity effects that I guess I didn't get.

5789
05:51:51,450 --> 05:51:54,010
Because especially in the beginning I was so...

5790
05:51:54,430 --> 05:51:57,010
...nervous, I was like, I can't have my sanity go down.

5791
05:51:59,270 --> 05:52:01,010
I was too scared of...

5792
05:52:02,190 --> 05:52:03,190
I was too scared.

5793
05:52:04,050 --> 05:52:05,070
I kind of regret it.

5794
05:52:05,970 --> 05:52:07,770
I kind of regret it, because...

5795
05:52:07,770 --> 05:52:11,450
This is definitely a game... You know what, the fact that they have the multiple playthroughs...

5796
05:52:11,450 --> 05:52:13,950
...is good, because then it gives you more chances to see.

5797
05:52:14,550 --> 05:52:17,350
It's kind of a game that needs multiple playthroughs, so...

5798
05:52:17,350 --> 05:52:19,090
The fact that it encourages...

5799
05:52:19,090 --> 05:52:22,850
Firstly, you can have the multiple playthroughs just so you can play through it again...

5800
05:52:22,850 --> 05:52:25,270
...but also to further the storyline.

5801
05:52:25,470 --> 05:52:26,530
So it's actually...

5802
05:52:27,370 --> 05:52:28,750
It's actually kind of genius.

5803
05:52:33,880 --> 05:52:35,900
There's a few videos with all the sanity effects.

5804
05:52:36,020 --> 05:52:37,320
Oh, I'll check it out then.

5805
05:52:39,240 --> 05:52:40,880
What an awesome game.

5806
05:52:42,280 --> 05:52:43,180
So cool.

5807
05:52:47,960 --> 05:52:49,740
Too bad Silicon Knights is gone.

5808
05:52:50,160 --> 05:52:51,380
Rip, Twin Snakes.

5809
05:52:51,820 --> 05:52:52,660
Rip, Eternal Darkness.

5810
05:52:52,660 --> 05:52:54,140
What else have they done?

5811
05:52:58,400 --> 05:52:58,840
Silicon...

5812
05:53:00,480 --> 05:53:00,920
Knights?

5813
05:53:07,460 --> 05:53:08,520
Oh, not a lot.

5814
05:53:11,300 --> 05:53:12,680
I actually don't know.

5815
05:53:13,260 --> 05:53:13,860
Too Human?

5816
05:53:14,020 --> 05:53:15,620
I feel like I've heard of that one before.

5817
05:53:16,200 --> 05:53:16,940
But the other ones?

5818
05:53:17,060 --> 05:53:17,660
Oh my gosh.

5819
05:53:19,220 --> 05:53:20,500
I don't know them at all.

5820
05:53:21,340 --> 05:53:23,300
Their last game was in 2011.

5821
05:53:27,590 --> 05:53:28,730
Actually, yeah.

5822
05:53:28,890 --> 05:53:32,630
I think I've heard of Too Human before, but I've never played it.

5823
05:53:42,130 --> 05:53:43,930
The game that bankrupted them.

5824
05:53:49,490 --> 05:53:54,250
Now I'm gonna go watch some sort of video essay about it.

5825
05:53:55,910 --> 05:53:58,990
I'm gonna go watch a video essay about why Too Human is so bad.

5826
05:53:58,990 --> 05:54:03,990
But at least we got the Twin Snakes.

5827
05:54:04,650 --> 05:54:06,270
Despite what people say, I love it.

5828
05:54:08,150 --> 05:54:08,990
Alrighty, guys.

5829
05:54:09,490 --> 05:54:10,770
I am going to head off.

5830
05:54:10,830 --> 05:54:11,610
I'm going to go eat.

5831
05:54:12,750 --> 05:54:15,590
Thank you guys for going on this adventure with me.

5832
05:54:15,790 --> 05:54:16,550
It was a lot of fun.

5833
05:54:17,210 --> 05:54:18,830
I'm glad we could finally beat it.

5834
05:54:19,610 --> 05:54:22,450
And on to other games from here on.

5835
05:54:22,610 --> 05:54:23,490
So very cool.

5836
05:54:23,630 --> 05:54:24,350
Very, very cool.

5837
05:54:25,230 --> 05:54:25,510
Yeah.

5838
05:54:27,310 --> 05:54:27,750
Otsu...Minta?

5839
05:54:28,970 --> 05:54:29,410
Otsupargon?

5840
05:54:30,250 --> 05:54:33,270
And I'll see you guys next time.

5841
05:54:33,870 --> 05:54:37,470
I'm not streaming tomorrow, so I'll see you guys when I see you.

5842
05:54:38,370 --> 05:54:39,130
Bye-bye!

5843
05:54:39,570 --> 05:54:40,030
Bye-bye!

5844
05:54:40,130 --> 05:54:41,510
Thank you for the pic!

5845
05:54:42,170 --> 05:54:44,070
Lots of good mental gaming moments.

5846
05:54:44,210 --> 05:54:44,310
Yeah!

5847
05:54:44,990 --> 05:54:45,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5848
05:54:46,310 --> 05:54:47,050
Bye-bye, everyone.

5849
05:54:47,490 --> 05:54:48,190
See you, see you, see you.

5850
05:54:48,250 --> 05:54:49,110
Thank you so much for watching.

5851
05:54:49,190 --> 05:54:49,850
Thanks for being here.

5852
05:54:49,890 --> 05:54:51,090
I really, really appreciate it.

5853
05:54:51,090 --> 05:54:53,890
Especially through all five parts of this insanity.

5854
05:54:55,610 --> 05:54:57,330
I really, really appreciate it.

5855
05:54:57,410 --> 05:54:58,190
Thank you!

5856
05:54:58,630 --> 05:54:58,910
Okay!

5857
05:54:59,670 --> 05:55:00,470
Bye-bye!

5858
05:55:00,550 --> 05:55:01,810
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye!
