1
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,560
What's happening?

2
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,460
What's happening?

3
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,200
Oh!

4
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,340
What's happening?

5
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:21,920
Oh!

6
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,260
What's happening?

7
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:23,960
Oh!

8
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,020
What's happening?

9
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:25,660
Oh!

10
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,200
What's happening?

11
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Oh!

12
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,040
What's happening?

13
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,700
Everything's fine.

14
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,380
I was like, why do I hear...

15
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,220
I was like, what happened to the audio?

16
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,120
I went to the bathroom and I wasn't listening to anything.

17
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,680
And then I come back and it just sounds like chaos.

18
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,680
I turned down the audio before, but...

19
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,910
I'll just do that.

20
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,450
There we go.

21
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,550
It's just, what's happening?

22
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:06,950
What's happening?

23
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,710
Oh!

24
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,910
Oh!

25
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,360
That's so funny.

26
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,040
I didn't realize I had my own stream open.

27
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,220
Wow.

28
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,440
Anyway, I had it open in another tab.

29
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
That's what happened in case you were like, what the heck was that?

30
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,740
Anyway...

31
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,880
There was just so much music.

32
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,920
I was like, what?

33
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,680
I've played this game for 30 minutes and it's actually as infuriating as the Ruinius game.

34
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,060
No way.

35
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,980
I was gonna say, surely it...

36
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,100
Really?

37
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,700
It's not easy?

38
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
I was like, surely it's gonna be...

39
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,380
It's gonna be...

40
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,160
Ore no Requiem Minto Experience.

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,500
Played a bit earlier and got to 95th zone.

42
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,440
Atlantis no Minto.

43
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,940
No, Phantom no Naisu.

44
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,160
Wait.

45
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,560
Oh gosh.

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
I didn't plan for playing so long.

47
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,840
I guess we'll play...

48
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,500
Until...

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,520
We don't.

50
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,520
I've been regretting her life choices.

51
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,380
Regretting my afterlife choices.

52
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,520
If you would like to play Phantom no Naisu...

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,620
The link is in the description.

54
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,400
This is a fan game.

55
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,820
A fan game by Giyoba.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,820
I hope I said that right.

57
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,600
So thank you!

58
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,380
This music is fire.

59
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:00,900
I know!

60
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
When I was listening to it, I was like...

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,300
My original opening.

62
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,540
And it actually has...

63
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,720
Thank you, thank you!

64
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,060
Oh, I actually forgot to say that.

65
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,940
Because I got so distracted by my endless voice.

66
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,380
We just started the stream, so...

67
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,240
Welcome in!

68
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,500
I always want to call you Sir Steak.

69
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,680
That's why I like... hesitate, you know?

70
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,620
Thank you guys!

71
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,300
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

72
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,120
I hope you had a good...

73
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
I hope you had a good stream.

74
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,460
Pyrobot, thanks for the 10 gift cards!

75
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, they don't stop.

76
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,020
We've already thanks you for the 5 gift cards.

77
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:12,780
Thank you!

78
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,360
You're in a video game, and I know!

79
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,840
But if you die in the video game...

80
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
I can't die in real life.

81
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm already dead.

82
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,480
So, I think we're fine.

83
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,720
Jack, thanks for 2 months!

84
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,440
Thanks for the gifts.

85
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,160
Yay!

86
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:33,980
Well, I'm glad.

87
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,540
Thanks for being around to be able to get another gifted.

88
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,840
Oh my gosh.

89
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,060
It's all green!

90
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,680
A shadow!

91
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,300
Thanks!

92
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,280
Welcome to Bubble Show!

93
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,340
I missed your stream yesterday because birthday dinner.

94
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,560
Devlin, was it your birthday yesterday?

95
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,560
Daddy, thanks for the 10 gifted!

96
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,660
Missed, welcome back!

97
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,620
Call me Troy, welcome back!

98
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,240
Can we propose to you at the concert?

99
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,000
Why?

100
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:05,800
Why?

101
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,960
Invisible Moose, thanks for the 10 gifted!

102
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,620
Oh my gosh, wait, there's actually...

103
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,500
Which ones have I not read?

104
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,780
Oh my...

105
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,280
Say, happy birthday!

106
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,680
Oh gosh, wait, I'm getting...

107
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,920
Wait, you guys, slow down please.

108
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,780
I'm getting overwhelmed.

109
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,600
I'm getting overwhelmed.

110
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,500
Wait...

111
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,720
There's too many things happening.

112
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,280
There's too many...

113
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,640
Jake, thanks for the super chat.

114
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,900
Okay, I have two birthday songs I need to sing.

115
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,540
Hold on, I am going to turn down the music just a little bit.

116
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,160
At least that noise.

117
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,340
As you can see, I've turned it down quite a bit.

118
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,400
I think that should be okay.

119
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,600
Okay, maybe it's just loud for me.

120
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,580
There we go.

121
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,680
Oh my gosh!

122
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,180
Thank you guys!

123
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,720
Okay, first, Devlin.

124
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,460
Happy birthday to you.

125
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,280
Happy birthday to you.

126
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,340
Happy birthday dear Devlin.

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,160
Happy birthday to you.

128
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,260
Happy birthday!

129
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,260
Mint.

130
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,040
Mint never changes.

131
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,620
Sing happy birthday!

132
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,320
Happy birthday to you.

133
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,240
Happy birthday to you.

134
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,560
Happy birthday dear Senka Shura.

135
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,980
Happy birthday to you.

136
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,760
Happy birthday!

137
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh my gosh, it's funny that you were the Metal Gear reference.

138
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,640
Okay, I have a reason for this, right?

139
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,960
So I got art.

140
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,340
Or rather, I saw my cup.

141
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:23,200
My cup designed today for Gamer Subs.

142
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,640
And I actually...

143
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,620
Part of it has a Metal Gear reference on it, right?

144
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,180
Because of course it does.

145
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,780
But I asked them to...

146
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,860
I asked them to make my panties transparent.

147
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,500
So that when you fill up the cup, it also changes the color.

148
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:02,770
So...

149
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,310
Yeah, they could be any color.

150
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:06,030
They could be lilac.

151
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,370
They could be blue.

152
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,650
They could be pink.

153
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,050
Whatever.

154
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:14,270
Whatever you desire.

155
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,230
Yes, yes.

156
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,590
Maybe it's a bad idea.

157
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:19,890
But, you know.

158
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,530
So...

159
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,310
So whenever that comes out, I hope you guys will enjoy.

160
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,950
If you decide to purchase.

161
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,450
And...

162
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,150
Yeah.

163
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,630
But it's also a Metal Gear reference too.

164
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,850
You'll know immediately.

165
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:40,890
You'll know immediately.

166
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,930
But it had me thinking.

167
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:45,210
I was just like, if I were to ever get a flavor...

168
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,610
Like, what would it be called, you know?

169
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,410
And I was like, what if instead of Snake Eater, it's Snake Drinker?

170
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,870
It's kind of funny.

171
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,470
Instead of Snake Eater.

172
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:10,150
Right?

173
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:15,870
And it's legally distinct, so...

174
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,390
Probably.

175
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,410
Who's JFJ?

176
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,630
Oh, Snake Oil.

177
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,510
Oh, you're right.

178
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,390
It's true.

179
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,430
Who's JFJ?

180
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,930
I don't know that guy.

181
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,630
Never change, you freak.

182
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,710
Yeah, but mine is a Metal Gear reference.

183
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:45,830
Right?

184
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,110
It's different.

185
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,510
Snake Freaker?

186
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,810
Well, I don't...

187
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,350
I don't have any...

188
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,730
You know, right now there's no plans for...

189
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,690
For a flavor, so...

190
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,930
It was just me thinking about it.

191
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,450
Because I don't want to be...

192
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:09,330
If the opportunity ever arises, I don't want to be blindsided by me being like...

193
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,170
I need a month to think about this, you know?

194
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,350
So...

195
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,570
Finally, a goof cup to drink my goof juice.

196
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,750
Which I used Code Boomer to buy.

197
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,910
Thank you!

198
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,630
Yes, Code Boomer.

199
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,310
Oh my gosh, I checked my...

200
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,770
I checked my gamer stuff for the first time yesterday.

201
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,990
Like...

202
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,910
How much I receive when you use my code and everything.

203
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,010
And oh my gosh, you guys actually use my code!

204
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,670
Like, a lot!

205
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,710
Oh my gosh!

206
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,030
You guys actually use it!

207
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,770
I was so... I was so... I was like...

208
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,250
That was so much!

209
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,750
I was like, no way!

210
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,850
So, thank you guys.

211
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,570
Sorry, I don't want this to seem like an advertisement or anything.

212
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,990
I was just thinking about it right before stream, so...

213
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,490
And also right before stream, actually like all day today, I was...

214
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:15,150
A couple of months ago, I streamed me doing a hand cam of me putting together a...

215
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,130
What do you call...

216
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,330
It's like one of those... You guys know those bookshelf...

217
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:21,970
Like...

218
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,570
It's like a bookshelf holder.

219
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,450
But...

220
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,570
It's supposed to be...

221
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:31,770
Like...

222
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:32,870
A miniature world.

223
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,350
Kind of...

224
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:34,890
A bookend!

225
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

226
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,710
A bookend!

227
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,230
But...

228
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,190
It's supposed to... Inside of it is like a miniature world and it's just like...

229
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:42,890
Cute, right?

230
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,730
And so I started building a little bit of that.

231
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:48,970
Robinhood!

232
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,550
Thank you for the tag, gifted!

233
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,590
Thank you!

234
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:58,130
Thank you for commissioning the art that I used for the thumbnail too.

235
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,470
I use it both times.

236
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:03,690
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,390
When are we getting a Minto cup?

238
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,510
I don't know when it's coming out.

239
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,810
To be honest.

240
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:13,610
I only saw the concept for the first time today.

241
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

242
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,690
We like you a little bit.

243
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,030
Thank you.

244
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,330
But...

245
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:26,230
So I streamed that some months ago and I literally have not touched it ever since.

246
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,250
Like, it was just sitting...

247
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:35,270
All the little tiny bits and pieces were just sitting on a little table in my room this entire time.

248
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:39,030
And so I was just like, I'm putting this together now.

249
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,130
Because I've been cleaning.

250
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,730
I've been doing some mega cleaning.

251
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,810
Especially because Matara is coming over.

252
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,710
I've been doing some mega cleaning and I've been also...

253
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,810
I rearranged some stuff in my room and...

254
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:57,270
Maybe, like, once I get things nice, I will maybe take a picture of my setup.

255
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,750
Because I'm really proud of it.

256
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,930
I did, like, cable management and it looks so nice and clean.

257
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,810
And I'm like...

258
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,510
It's so good.

259
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,350
And...

260
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,210
Is this the game music?

261
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:09,970
It is!

262
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,010
Yeah, it's from...

263
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,670
It's my original opening song.

264
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,130
But...

265
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,550
I was like, I'm gonna put this together before she gets here.

266
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,750
Not for her, but because I want...

267
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,590
I'm just, like, you know, getting a bunch of clutter out of the way.

268
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,970
And it's just been sitting on this table.

269
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,370
And so I spent...

270
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,930
I've been working on it for, like, several hours now.

271
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,390
My thumb is numb.

272
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:40,430
And my fingers are covered in glue and they're all red.

273
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,870
Because it's, like, you know, it's wood pieces that you're, like, sticking in.

274
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:47,790
And they're, like, you have to press down really hard.

275
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:51,590
And so my thumb, like, is really sore right now.

276
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,710
But I got a lot of progress done.

277
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,650
I think...

278
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,190
I think probably next week I can stream finishing it.

279
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,970
So I'll get a lot more done.

280
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,110
Maybe, like, tomorrow and the day after.

281
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,510
I have some other stuff I need to do too.

282
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,310
That I was supposed to do today instead.

283
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,450
But I said I'll do it tomorrow.

284
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,990
So I think I'll do that next week.

285
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,150
Where we finish it on stream.

286
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,150
And then I can put it on my bookshelf.

287
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,070
I can put it in between all of my doujins.

288
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,270
And it'll look really beautiful.

289
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,450
Because my doujinshi are also pink.

290
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,950
It'll go in so perfectly.

291
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:34,930
Yeah.

292
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,930
It'll fit in so perfectly.

293
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,970
I've been slightly pinkifying my room.

294
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,670
Like...

295
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,970
Hi Mito, it is not my birthday.

296
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,470
But it is the birthday of the hit game Super Smash Bros.

297
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,430
Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube.

298
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,870
It would mean the world if you could sing for them.

299
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,910
Happy birthday to Smash.

300
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,090
Happy birthday to Smash.

301
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,770
Happy birthday Super Smash Bros.

302
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,870
Melee for Nintendo Gamecube.

303
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,890
Happy birthday.

304
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,750
Smash or pass.

305
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,220
Melee.

306
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,360
I have room on my bookshelf.

307
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,860
I was just looking at it.

308
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,660
I was like, wait a second, do I have room?

309
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,800
I actually had to clear a shelf because it was all Metal Gear.

310
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,420
Now there's only just one shelf that's all Metal Gear.

311
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,520
Now I have an extra shelf.

312
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,380
Minten is saying happy birthday for any Metal Gear Solid but sang for Smash.

313
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,780
I sang Snake Eater.

314
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,860
Actually no, that's not true.

315
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,980
That's not true.

316
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,600
I sang happy birthday to Metal Gear Solid 2.

317
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,340
That was literally like last week.

318
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,240
I did.

319
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,880
I sang happy birthday in the off collab with Doki Bird.

320
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,060
I sang happy birthday to Metal Gear Solid 2.

321
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,640
I did.

322
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,760
I sang it.

323
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:29,460
She gets baited so easily when it comes to the truth.

324
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,460
I do.

325
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,220
Because the truth reigns supreme.

326
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,080
I just realized you guys, I forgot my drink.

327
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,300
I'm going to go grab it real quick.

328
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,440
I'm going to go grab my... I forgot my drink.

329
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:42,820
Sorry.

330
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,380
I told you, I was working on this model thing.

331
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,340
I was not ready.

332
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,320
I got really... I got lost in the sauce.

333
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,480
I was like so... I was so in it.

334
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,080
And then like 15 minutes before stream I was like...

335
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,140
So...

336
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,220
Yeah, I'm just going to go grab...

337
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,340
I got it.

338
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,340
It's like...

339
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,300
It's already made.

340
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,260
I made it before stream and then I forgot to grab it.

341
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:07,740
Okay.

342
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,380
Why am I explaining myself to you?

343
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,460
Was it Metal Gear Solid 3's birthday earlier this month?

344
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,760
It was like two days ago or something.

345
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,080
It was this month, yeah.

346
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,220
It's already made.

347
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,000
Why am I explaining...

348
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,820
BRB.

349
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,800
Alrighty.

350
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,060
Super Famicom.

351
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,860
Oh my goodness.

352
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,660
Don't scatter!

353
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,620
I'm right here.

354
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Don't scatter.

355
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,700
What are you doing?

356
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,640
Sillies?

357
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,520
Don't scatter.

358
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,460
Well guys, if this is just as difficult...

359
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,240
I'm scared.

360
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm scared.

361
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,440
What if I...

362
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,720
I...

363
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,880
What if it...

364
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,300
What if it's so bad?

365
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,980
You should be scared.

366
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,800
Like the part where she explained why it was okay for her to leave for longer than it took to get her drink.

367
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,220
What are you talking about?

368
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,980
I have...

369
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,620
Every time I leave my room, I pet each cat.

370
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,920
Is that the explanation you wanted?

371
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,540
I have to check on my cats every time I leave.

372
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,180
I go...

373
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,400
And I pet them and I kiss them.

374
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,140
And I say...

375
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,440
Be good boys and girls.

376
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,680
Well, boy and girl.

377
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,560
Acceptable.

378
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,360
Thank you.

379
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,920
Wait, did you totally miss...

380
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,020
I like the part where she explained why it was okay for her to leave...

381
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,960
For longer than it took...

382
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,400
Huh?

383
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,540
I'm confused.

384
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,340
Can you do a few takes on the Blade Runner quote?

385
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,700
That's for an animation.

386
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,220
Okay, hold on.

387
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,340
Let me turn the music off.

388
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:41,840
Okay.

389
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,740
I have five cats.

390
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,720
The struggle is real.

391
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,060
You can't hear it, right?

392
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,060
Okay, yeah, you can't.

393
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:50,920
Okay.

394
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,300
I'll try for this animation.

395
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,960
This is the one with the lady in the sky, right?

396
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,340
Right?

397
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,960
I like watching the Kiara one.

398
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,360
Okay.

399
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,080
Okay.

400
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,260
Hello, handsome.

401
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,220
What a day, hmm?

402
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,180
You look lonely.

403
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,760
I can fix that.

404
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,900
You look like a good wisp.

405
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,460
Is that good?

406
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,060
Is that okay?

407
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,520
I'll try one more.

408
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:27,920
One more.

409
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,680
Hello, handsome.

410
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,460
What a day, hmm?

411
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,240
You look lonely.

412
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,900
I can fix that.

413
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,040
You look like a good wisp.

414
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,260
Okay.

415
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,860
Stop it, you guys.

416
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,100
It's forced acting.

417
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:51,990
It's forced acting.

418
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,900
The perfect stream to bleed out in the snow too.

419
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,160
And I will be bleeding out in Phantom No Nazo.

420
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,060
Let's play!

421
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,900
Actually, I was just like, surely I'll be able to get through this so easily.

422
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,740
And then maybe after if I, you know, still wanna keep going...

423
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:25,120
I can play like Freak or Treat or something since I haven't done that.

424
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,840
Is that the movie with Ryan Reynolds?

425
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:29,920
Yes.

426
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,200
Yes.

427
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,420
The Blade Runner?

428
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

429
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,510
No.

430
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,850
No, no, guys.

431
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,300
What was Ryan Reynolds in?

432
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,920
Wolverine, Wolverine, Wolverine.

433
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,620
He's not Wolverine.

434
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,080
Deadpool!

435
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,120
Deadpool, Deadpool, Deadpool.

436
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,160
No, he wasn't in the notebook.

437
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:13,800
I remember.

438
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,760
He was in the notebook too.

439
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,100
At least I have to watch that.

440
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:19,720
Should I?

441
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,320
What is a hardcore mode?

442
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,360
Should I do easy?

443
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,720
No.

444
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,820
This is my own fan game.

445
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,040
I'm not gonna do easy mode.

446
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,340
Why would I even consider that?

447
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,380
The journey starts.

448
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,640
Oh.

449
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,660
Here I go.

450
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:41,760
Not that way.

451
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,520
I like how I'm poor.

452
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,220
Oh, 50 yen!

453
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,340
Oh my God.

454
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,740
I forgot you can't touch the guys.

455
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,920
I forgot that this game is not for the faint of heart.

456
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,340
What is this?

457
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,200
Oh, thank goodness.

458
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,430
Oh no!

459
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,170
Oh no!

460
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,550
Gibby, why did you do this to me?

461
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,970
Gibby, why did you make such a difficult game?

462
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:36,570
Oh my God!

463
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,070
Oh my God!

464
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,790
OK, now we are safe.

465
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,850
Oh my God!

466
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,390
Oh my God!

467
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:46,570
OK, I'm just gonna jump over it.

468
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,890
One Zone!

469
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,950
We made it to One Zone.

470
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,010
My favorite one.

471
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,830
Why did I jump?

472
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,030
I thought the...

473
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,110
I thought the gravestone would block it.

474
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,030
This is too accurate.

475
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,330
This is too...

476
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,930
Oh my God.

477
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:20,450
Oh my God.

478
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,490
No, please don't kill me.

479
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,030
Please.

480
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,610
Oh my God.

481
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:24,090
Oh my God.

482
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:25,270
No, no, no, no.

483
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,520
How...Gibby, how many times did you play Phantom No Nazo to truly understand its intricacies?

484
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,880
You're even getting the jumping part correct.

485
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,780
Like it's actually terrifying how accurate this feels.

486
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,360
OK, I'm gonna make a...I'm gonna risk it all for the biscuit all.

487
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,260
Risking it!

488
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,080
Risking it!

489
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,540
Risking is good business!

490
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,380
You must take high risks, high rewards!

491
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,260
Yeah, baby!

492
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,680
Oh my God.

493
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,160
No, no, no.

494
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,480
No.

495
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,440
Oh, thank goodness.

496
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,340
All I did was walk!

497
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,360
And then...

498
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,330
OK.

499
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,090
Risk it all!

500
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,430
Oh my gosh, sorry.

501
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,010
I did not mean to scream like that.

502
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,130
Oh gosh.

503
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,510
No!

504
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,640
There's a hundred stages, you guys!

505
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,120
There's one hundred stages!

506
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:03,680
I love Mint's generational throws.

507
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,820
What do you mean by that?

508
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,600
Like I'm making fun of old people or...

509
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,320
Throwing shade at the elderly?

510
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,500
Bozo?

511
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,240
Yeah.

512
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,400
Let's pass this one.

513
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,340
Oh my God, guys.

514
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:30,920
Wait.

515
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,140
No!

516
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,840
Oh no, it was a trap!

517
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,780
No, no, please!

518
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,420
I can still make it.

519
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,590
This is how you do it, guys.

520
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:53,070
So is this like a reskin of Atlantis No Nazo or is it a full new game?

521
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,570
Full new game, I believe.

522
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,770
Risk it all!

523
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,630
You have an attack.

524
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,410
Oh you're right!

525
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:12,150
I do have an attack!

526
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,730
You're right!

527
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,150
You're right!

528
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:16,610
Completely...

529
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:17,810
Forgot.

530
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,410
Wait, can I attack?

531
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,410
Can I kill these guys?

532
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,370
Can I kill the Wisps?

533
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,830
She hurts us!

534
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,430
Oh, OK.

535
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,150
OK.

536
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,110
Oh my God!

537
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,800
Please, please, please, please.

538
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,460
Leave me alone.

539
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,500
No!

540
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,020
I think what was really funny about this was seeing the comments...

541
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,740
Oh my God, how did I make that?

542
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,880
Seeing the comments on this, on the Itch.io page from this was really funny because there was someone who was just like...

543
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,920
I don't know anything about Mint Phantom, but I'm a big fan of Atlantis No Nazo.

544
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,940
Can even I play this game?

545
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:17,820
Please.

546
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:18,800
No, please.

547
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,920
I need to...

548
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,340
No, no, no.

549
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,020
OK.

550
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,140
Close, close.

551
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,280
No, no, no.

552
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:44,680
I think they were worried that they wouldn't be able to understand some of the attacks and stuff if they were like...

553
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,660
You know, centered around me kind of deal.

554
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,580
Like, oh, I don't know Mint Phantom, so I don't know how she...

555
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,560
Why you would use this attack unless you watch her...

556
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,160
Please.

557
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:00,740
Oh my gosh.

558
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,880
How do I... How do I open the doors again?

559
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,980
How do I open the doors again?

560
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:15,780
Bomb.

561
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,320
Wait, I don't have... Oh wait, do I have to throw it myself?

562
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:22,720
Bomb.

563
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,700
Attack it.

564
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,120
I have to get down there first I think.

565
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,260
Alright.

566
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,840
Oh gosh, I'm running out of time.

567
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,420
Ten Question Minky Quiz.

568
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,040
I did it!

569
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,440
I did it!

570
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,950
It's so cruel.

571
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,050
Goodbye cruel world.

572
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,050
Gosh, I'm having such major...

573
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:12,070
I'm having so many flashbacks to this.

574
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:18,270
I feel like I'm in... I can't even speak.

575
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,580
I never want to hear you guys say she hates us again.

576
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,740
Not when this is how I'm being treated.

577
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,240
By my own wisps.

578
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,540
Oh my God.

579
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:44,900
Oh my God.

580
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,120
Please.

581
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,960
So if I crouch and throw.

582
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:47,700
Oh OK.

583
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:47,760
OK.

584
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,320
No, no, no.

585
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,560
Please let me down soon.

586
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,720
Third zone!

587
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,260
Oh gosh.

588
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,420
Anything up here?

589
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,220
Maybe not.

590
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,000
I got money though.

591
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,800
Yeah.

592
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,700
Oh my God his body parts.

593
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,300
Yeah.

594
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,140
Oh my God.

595
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,180
Double, double.

596
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,360
Double trouble.

597
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,580
There are body parts everywhere.

598
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
It's really gross.

599
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,560
Awesome.

600
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,400
Oh my God.

601
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,850
I'm never going to make it back here.

602
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,350
I'm going to lose all my lives and I'll never be able to come back.

603
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,170
Oh my God.

604
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,210
Oh my God.

605
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,110
Please, please, please.

606
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,430
Where are the wisps?

607
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,770
OK.

608
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,430
Throw.

609
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:02,610
Oh my God.

610
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:03,830
OK.

611
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:04,590
We are gaming.

612
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:05,050
We are gaming.

613
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,150
We are gaming.

614
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:08,670
We are gaming.

615
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,170
OK.

616
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:13,090
Nice, nice.

617
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,730
Oh gosh.

618
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:15,310
Oh gosh.

619
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,010
Oh gosh.

620
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,410
Throw, throw, throw!

621
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:18,850
No!

622
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,190
No, not close enough.

623
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,230
Very gently.

624
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,410
Gently now.

625
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:29,570
OK.

626
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,250
Ninth zone!

627
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,950
Ninth zone!

628
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,410
Well that

629
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,070
was unfair.

630
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,670
Welcome to the world of X-No-Nazo.

631
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,000
Welcome to the world... What is hardcore?

632
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,320
No!

633
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:10,010
There is no way anyone can do this.

634
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:10,850
Oh my God.

635
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,300
I did it on purpose.

636
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,920
You know?

637
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:33,800
Because...

638
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,740
I did it on purpose, you know?

639
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,380
So that we could...

640
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,360
So that we could just continue on normally, you know?

641
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,620
Are you going to leave or...

642
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,140
Oh wait.

643
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,780
I don't need to touch you guys.

644
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,160
Hey come here.

645
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,220
Fall to your death.

646
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,600
Yeah, that's right.

647
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,440
Oh, that's right.

648
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,120
There is nothing here.

649
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,040
Not that I know of at least.

650
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,040
Maybe I need to explode something over there.

651
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,340
Maybe...

652
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,620
I should have done that instead of going to this hellhole.

653
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:10,640
Please.

654
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,020
I don't want to be back here.

655
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,200
Hidden door?

656
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,080
Yeah, I think there might be a hidden door over there.

657
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,760
Oh God, please.

658
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,220
No!

659
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:33,940
There we go.

660
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,980
No, just kidding.

661
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:35,920
Please.

662
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,780
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

663
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,880
Oh my God.

664
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,360
I have to be careful.

665
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,240
Be careful!

666
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,040
Don't get greedy.

667
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,480
Yes!

668
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,420
Okay.

669
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,700
Third zone!

670
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,160
Look, there is a door there.

671
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,940
I'm just going to jump over this guy.

672
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,100
Oh no!

673
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:01,740
Oh no!

674
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,340
No!

675
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,520
My God!

676
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,920
There is a manual in the menu.

677
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,060
It explains Hardcore.

678
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,940
I thought Hardcore was just one life.

679
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,980
Is it different than that?

680
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,620
More than just one single life?

681
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,760
You know what?

682
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,620
Maybe it's safer to just blow these guys up.

683
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,480
We're in no rush.

684
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,900
Good thing I blowed him up.

685
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,820
Good thing I blowed him up though.

686
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:33,400
Good thing.

687
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,360
Okay, keep going.

688
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,200
Keep blowing up.

689
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,000
Oh, come on.

690
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,580
There we go.

691
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:44,580
Blow it up.

692
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,720
Nice.

693
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:49,620
Okay.

694
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,440
I think I need to run immediately.

695
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,060
Okay, I need to like...this one I need to go immediately.

696
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,400
Okay, here we go.

697
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,370
Where are they?

698
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:07,610
There they are.

699
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:16,910
Where did they come from?

700
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,130
Oh no, no, no, no, no!

701
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:19,770
There we go, there we go.

702
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,630
What the...

703
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,270
Why were there doubles?

704
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,030
I flew!

705
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,750
Why is this game so accurate?

706
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,030
Why is it so accurate?

707
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,190
No!

708
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,010
God, why?

709
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,670
You studied the game too hard, Gibby.

710
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,930
Please!

711
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,850
I don't care!

712
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,130
We are going to the 8th zone!

713
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,160
No way, I want to go back.

714
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,060
I want to go back!

715
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,500
Okay, let's continue onward.

716
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,440
Okay.

717
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:15,340
Retreat!

718
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,200
Retreat!

719
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,820
Tactical retreat!

720
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,260
Retreat!

721
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,120
We

722
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:39,740
got it!

723
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,100
We got it!

724
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,880
Why is it a different color?

725
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,740
Oh my gosh!

726
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,690
I got used to the car...

727
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,370
Oh my God!

728
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,050
Oh my God!

729
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,250
It requires...

730
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:03,770
Oh my God!

731
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:05,350
It requires every...

732
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,710
Every ounce of...

733
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:08,230
Oh my God!

734
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:08,870
Please!

735
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,020
The precision!

736
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:15,720
The precision!

737
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,520
I'm running in traffic!

738
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:21,860
Why do I need the money anyway?

739
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,100
Okay, you can't go the other way!

740
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,200
I like the music in this one.

741
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,840
America, the cornfields!

742
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,140
I love the cornfields of America!

743
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,770
You guys, I'm going to lose it here at the 10th zone!

744
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,330
Kachominto-san!

745
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,290
Why is this suddenly Game Center CX?

746
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:00,910
No!

747
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,670
I don't want to be on it!

748
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:03,330
Please!

749
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,450
Whose existence is suffering?

750
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,910
What's your order at Whack Donald's, you guys?

751
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,630
I can't look at chat in this area, you guys.

752
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,690
I gotta full pay attention.

753
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:34,490
We did it!

754
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:35,990
A big whack.

755
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:36,550
No!

756
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:37,990
Please God, no!

757
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,810
I'm still in the streets!

758
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,190
I think this game is harder than the original.

759
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,980
Is Henya driving those trucks?

760
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:15,880
Oh my God.

761
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,400
I was in tears at the clip that Zentraia posted of Henya driving.

762
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:29,450
20 piece chimpkin wick nuggets.

763
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,930
Sorry.

764
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,510
It's all over.

765
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,350
There has to be more secret doors, right?

766
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:45,670
I believe.

767
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,490
Wait, give me my money.

768
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,890
There was money over here, wasn't there?

769
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:54,650
Wasn't there?

770
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:57,150
Am I crazy?

771
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,630
Wasn't there a platform up there?

772
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,290
I guess not.

773
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,530
Oh!

774
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,390
Reaction time of a... of a... of a bunny.

775
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,030
OK, let's try.

776
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:18,030
It was a different stage?

777
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,930
Ah, I see.

778
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,190
I knew it!

779
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,690
I knew it!

780
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,010
Oh my God.

781
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,040
I knew it!

782
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:36,540
I knew it!

783
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,200
I knew it!

784
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,300
Oh my gosh!

785
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:41,540
I know Atlantis, I know Nazo too much now, actually.

786
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,760
That's actually concerning.

787
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,140
Wait a second.

788
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,720
Oh my God, where are we anyway?

789
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,300
Wait, this is the sec... second...

790
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:04,820
Oh!

791
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,320
Please!

792
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:11,900
Yes!

793
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,660
If we go... If we drop...

794
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:24,800
If we drop down... Oh my gosh.

795
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,260
No, it's fine.

796
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:33,860
8th zone?

797
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,100
Wait, wasn't this the bad zone?

798
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:36,440
Yes!

799
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:37,340
Oh my Go...

800
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:58,630
Yes!

801
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:04,210
I wonder if we can get downstairs down there.

802
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,150
Oh shit!

803
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,190
What?

804
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:09,550
What is this hitbox?

805
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,310
I swear!

806
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:16,050
Don't come towards me!

807
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:17,230
You freak!

808
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:19,470
Not affectionate.

809
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,210
There we go.

810
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,770
I wonder if there is a way to get down there.

811
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:31,670
You think?

812
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,830
If I like drop down and quickly...

813
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,050
This game also has like... This game is actually a little different than Atlantis on Nazo because...

814
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:43,230
Oh!

815
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,650
If I went for the other way!

816
00:47:46,110 --> 00:47:47,450
I should have got dropped from the left.

817
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:48,370
OK, we'll do it from the left.

818
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:51,830
I forgot how far you drop from, you know.

819
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:55,450
But there is also different outfits in this.

820
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,790
There is different outfits and different power-ups.

821
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,650
Which makes it different from Atlantis on Nazo.

822
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:07,370
A little bit.

823
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,810
OK, let's drop from here!

824
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,420
Nevermind.

825
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,240
It's too accurate to the original man!

826
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:25,850
It's so...

827
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,680
I say well made like lovingly, you know.

828
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:43,660
Like it's well made and it's a great parody, you know.

829
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,760
It's a great recreation of the original.

830
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:48,960
Truly.

831
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,240
It's very accurate.

832
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,180
Oh my gosh.

833
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,640
Give me my Oshibari.

834
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,740
Oh it's a decoy octopus.

835
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,060
Welcome to the membership.

836
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,220
Ah decoy octopus.

837
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,460
Oh my gosh.

838
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,260
Like here is there...

839
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,640
Is there a door here?

840
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,460
It looks suspicious, right?

841
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:13,340
See?

842
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:15,900
You guys, I know.

843
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,200
I think with the Atlantis on Nazo brain at this point.

844
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm a...

845
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,240
What is this?

846
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,280
Wait, what is this?

847
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,040
I think with the actual Atlantis on Nazo brain.

848
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,700
I can't believe this.

849
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,340
I'm becoming a...

850
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,420
Oh no, no, no.

851
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:37,120
Ah no, no, no.

852
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,980
OK, we might have to like... Hold on.

853
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,360
Let's prepare...

854
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,300
No, no.

855
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:42,740
I don't want to prepare the door just yet.

856
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,300
OK, here we go.

857
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,180
Nice, nice.

858
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,040
Oh no.

859
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:48,580
Nice, nice.

860
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:50,340
Nice, nice.

861
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:51,680
Nice!

862
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:52,920
No!

863
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,560
How can I mess up the last one?

864
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:58,800
OK, hold on.

865
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,640
Not nice.

866
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,520
Honestly, I got lucky those past couple times.

867
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,440
Let's reset the timer.

868
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,220
Grab more... Oh, this money I already stole from that wallet.

869
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:16,520
Need a notebook strategy guide.

870
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,500
I think someone... I think...

871
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,300
I think I saw that someone had streamed this.

872
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,120
Actually, I think it's easier going from this side.

873
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:32,680
Nice.

874
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,420
OK.

875
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,020
Nice.

876
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,680
Ah!

877
00:50:57,270 --> 00:50:57,570
Shit.

878
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,690
I pressed... I pressed it, but sometimes...

879
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:02,150
OK, hold on.

880
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:02,950
I want more time.

881
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:04,090
I want more time!

882
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,030
Looking forward to reading your Phantom Nonazo guide on GameFAQs.

883
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,950
This is the strat, you guys.

884
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:17,630
This is how you get more time, you know.

885
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:20,050
I need to know what this is.

886
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,730
Is it money?

887
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:21,830
Is it a power-up?

888
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,610
Like, if it's a power-up, that's huge.

889
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,430
We gotta have a power-up.

890
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:30,530
Oh, is the block upstairs?

891
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:35,890
Presenting... Preventing me, not presenting me.

892
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:37,030
I'm sorry.

893
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,030
See, I have to do a small jump like that, you know.

894
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,520
Guys, we'll get this.

895
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:06,700
We'll get this thing.

896
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,280
Ah!

897
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:18,830
Oh my gosh!

898
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:19,210
No!

899
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:20,750
Anime is so bad!

900
00:52:24,090 --> 00:52:26,090
At least we are not in the streets, you guys.

901
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,790
Honestly.

902
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,170
This is pretty tame.

903
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,300
It's the same attack.

904
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,270
Extra life?

905
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:04,370
I just have a coin!

906
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,990
I don't know what it means, but...

907
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,030
I don't know what it means.

908
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:17,890
Is it just a collectible?

909
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,810
Wait, do I have to go to the...

910
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,990
Do I have to go to that...

911
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,400
You got glide.

912
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,380
Oh my gosh!

913
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:37,980
That's huge!

914
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,660
Wait, that's actually so huge for the next one?

915
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,120
That's actually so...

916
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,240
Oh my god!

917
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,440
That's huge for this next world!

918
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,680
What the...

919
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,580
Are you OK?

920
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:09,480
This one.

921
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:14,260
Oh wait, I can float to the bottom part.

922
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:16,680
I was thinking this.

923
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,920
I can't...

924
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,460
Oh you can't...

925
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,520
OK,

926
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,400
so you can glide.

927
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,280
OK, I'm too much of a baby.

928
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,320
Alright, they can glide.

929
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:44,160
So

930
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,520
from here...

931
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,140
I'm scared.

932
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,980
We made it!

933
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:16,560
We made it!

934
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,660
We made it!

935
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,720
Do

936
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,740
we go down?

937
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,240
75th zone!

938
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,080
75th zone!

939
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,940
This is evil.

940
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,300
I killed a zombie!

941
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:53,380
Zombie!

942
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,300
I killed another zombie.

943
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,700
Oh my god, I killed another zombie.

944
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,700
Sorry for flashing lights everybody.

945
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,520
Flashing light.

946
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,350
Are we gonna run out of time?

947
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:17,690
Oh no, it's over here!

948
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,130
76th zone!

949
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:21,290
76th zone!

950
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,240
I slowly sunk to my death.

951
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:01,910
Oh I have to go up.

952
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:04,210
OK, I have to keep going up.

953
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:05,710
And around.

954
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:08,650
Wait for that bat to pass.

955
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,070
OK.

956
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:11,810
OK.

957
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:14,670
And then...

958
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:15,810
Wait, this is gonna be tricky.

959
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:18,610
This is gonna be tricky.

960
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:20,810
Oh gosh.

961
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,290
How do I jump up there though?

962
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:25,510
No, no.

963
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,930
We don't have a lot of time left.

964
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:29,230
Oh shoot!

965
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:30,510
Oh gosh!

966
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:34,730
Please, please register my input.

967
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:38,810
I threw that out of...

968
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,700
You think there has to be a secret door?

969
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,060
I think you're just supposed to be fast here, right?

970
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,560
I don't even know where a secret door would be at.

971
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,600
I think you just have to be fast.

972
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:04,320
Oh

973
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:08,710
no, there we go.

974
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,260
Oh my gosh, I almost just kept running and not even thinking.

975
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,680
I was just like, what if I just hold right?

976
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:33,020
Hold right in this world.

977
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:39,260
We all just move to the right and then we move to the left and we never think about...

978
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,160
No, no!

979
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,520
Oh gosh!

980
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:47,400
I think I can stand with these guys, yeah.

981
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:52,060
Shoot.

982
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,540
I think as soon as...

983
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,960
I can't read it.

984
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:09,400
I'm sorry.

985
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:10,540
I'm on a time limit.

986
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:11,940
I'm sorry.

987
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,400
It's too tight.

988
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,120
What if I just always hold left?

989
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,500
What if I just hold left forever?

990
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,180
I don't consider any holes.

991
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:29,040
I don't consider anything.

992
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:30,800
I just hold left.

993
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,700
Hold left.

994
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,260
Hold left.

995
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,860
Hold left.

996
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,720
Wait, do I not...

997
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,320
Oh, sorry.

998
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,860
Wait, I was gonna say, do I not have my ghost anymore?

999
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:49,920
I don't think I have my ghost jump anymore.

1000
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:57,500
Oh, these are...oh wait, I saw ashes.

1001
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,080
I thought...oh.

1002
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,420
I love Ryan Reynolds in that movie.

1003
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,640
No, I'm not sick.

1004
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,520
I got something caught in my throat.

1005
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,120
My ghost medal disappeared.

1006
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,140
No!

1007
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:13,720
I was relying on it.

1008
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,600
I'm gonna run out of time here.

1009
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,680
Oh my gosh!

1010
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,400
What's the timing here?

1011
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,500
The timing was good.

1012
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:40,280
Yeah, I just...I don't think I'm gonna make it, guys.

1013
01:00:58,830 --> 01:00:59,750
Good run.

1014
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:00,310
Yeah!

1015
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:03,450
How did we get there again?

1016
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,290
I discovered...

1017
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:14,450
I discovered a...oh my god, please come this way.

1018
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,030
Yes, thank you.

1019
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:18,790
Where was it though?

1020
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:20,930
The grave.

1021
01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:24,750
But rather there was first here, right?

1022
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:28,310
There...

1023
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1024
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,110
OK, from here.

1025
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:47,650
OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
01:01:47,650 --> 01:01:48,010
This is good.

1027
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:48,490
This is good.

1028
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:49,750
From here?

1029
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,190
And then we go collect the coin?

1030
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:55,770
Then we go collect the coin?

1031
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:06,550
Take.

1032
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,010
Feel my fury.

1033
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:09,570
And then here?

1034
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:19,720
Sixth!

1035
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,140
Coin.

1036
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:27,340
Oh my gosh.

1037
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,580
I'm regressing.

1038
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,480
There we go.

1039
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,420
First try!

1040
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:55,480
It just takes me a bit to get into the groove of the Atlantis No Nazo...

1041
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,920
universe, you know?

1042
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,820
The...

1043
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:04,780
A-N-N extended universe.

1044
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:07,720
Die zombie.

1045
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:08,580
Oh my god.

1046
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,480
Die zombie.

1047
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:16,620
Die zombie.

1048
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,500
Oh my god.

1049
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,420
Die zombie.

1050
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,720
I'm starting to believe.

1051
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,600
I don't know about that.

1052
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,060
That's a little...

1053
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:28,000
That's a little...

1054
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,240
I

1055
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,380
glided right into his face!

1056
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:40,980
Messed up.

1057
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,480
Messed up!

1058
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,740
I told you.

1059
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,860
Believing was maybe a bit too strong of a word.

1060
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:02,600
How did I do it before?

1061
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:04,380
I think I just did like a...

1062
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:06,020
Oh gosh.

1063
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,200
Oh god, I'm scared.

1064
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:11,900
Okay, I have to double.

1065
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,380
Wait, if I fall...

1066
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:18,720
Does it count?

1067
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:25,740
Okay.

1068
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,100
Okay, so I have to...

1069
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,640
Tiny, tiny jumping!

1070
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,460
I did it!

1071
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:33,780
I did it!

1072
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:34,120
I did it!

1073
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:34,660
Nice!

1074
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:34,940
Okay.

1075
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:40,220
Goodness, because we were almost out of...

1076
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:41,500
We were almost out of time.

1077
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,140
Have confidence.

1078
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,300
No confidence a moment.

1079
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,320
Okay, then we have this annoying place.

1080
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:51,580
Explode zombie.

1081
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:53,840
Explode zombie.

1082
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,440
Explode zombie.

1083
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,380
Explode zombie.

1084
01:04:58,980 --> 01:04:59,920
Explode zombie.

1085
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:02,640
Explode zombie.

1086
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,220
Explode zombie.

1087
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,260
Explode zombie.

1088
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,760
Oh my gosh.

1089
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,320
Too close a zombie.

1090
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:14,860
Gosh.

1091
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,540
Okay, we are back here.

1092
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,640
We are back to the bats.

1093
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:25,080
Alright, this is the furthest... This is as far as we have gotten.

1094
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:30,020
In this game.

1095
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:34,460
This is the furthest we have gotten you guys.

1096
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,700
Okay.

1097
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,620
The music sounds so sad.

1098
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,980
That's just how I sound.

1099
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:27,540
Or how I feel.

1100
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:33,100
I just feel...

1101
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,500
Worst part is...

1102
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,860
At least with Atlantis, there was a guide I could look up, you know?

1103
01:06:44,180 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't think I can jump over this guy.

1104
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:55,160
So close!

1105
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,940
I don't think I can jump over him though.

1106
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:03,280
Secret door in top left.

1107
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,880
I tried throwing a bomb at there.

1108
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,520
I don't want to waste the time to do it.

1109
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,580
I don't have the coin anymore.

1110
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:13,960
I can't jump and hover everybody.

1111
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,060
I tried it last time we were in here.

1112
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:21,920
The coin disappears after you fall.

1113
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:28,920
Two.

1114
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:33,980
Two.

1115
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:34,160
Oh there.

1116
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:34,920
There is ashes.

1117
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,120
Try different timing.

1118
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:44,620
It's harder than you think.

1119
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:52,720
Because I'm trying to go as soon as the bat is gone from me.

1120
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:01,720
Since the bat flies beyond me, I can't...

1121
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,720
I can't go before...

1122
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,740
Oh my god!

1123
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,140
I need to...

1124
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:27,880
And also, I swear, I think the timing is different from the left.

1125
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,160
Like when you start over from the very left.

1126
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,060
I think it changes the timing of it.

1127
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,440
I kind of remember how there were the ghosts that did that trail.

1128
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,780
And then if I went over, it would reset the timing.

1129
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:45,780
I think that's what's happening here.

1130
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:13,210
Oh...

1131
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:15,410
Okay, so I have to... Ouch, I just bit my tongue again.

1132
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:19,030
I have to be... I have to be...

1133
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,910
Okay, I know I have to have the second block...

1134
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,390
I have to have the block in my view.

1135
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:33,490
I have to have this block in my view for the bats to not be weird.

1136
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,550
If I go over too far, it doesn't work.

1137
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:03,680
At least I didn't die, but we are going to run out of time!

1138
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:09,630
Okay, so I can block it in view.

1139
01:10:10,430 --> 01:10:10,750
No!

1140
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,540
Shooting the bats mid-air.

1141
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:26,460
Let's try that.

1142
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,480
Yeah, let's try killing the bats.

1143
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,340
Let's try killing the bats.

1144
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,360
Because you can!

1145
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,560
Well, hold on.

1146
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:45,660
Hold on.

1147
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,200
This is possible.

1148
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,280
It's possible.

1149
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,060
Maybe.

1150
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,220
No.

1151
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:00,780
There we go.

1152
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:02,300
Alright.

1153
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,200
You sound like the Joker.

1154
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,780
All we have to do is kill the Batman.

1155
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,680
That was close.

1156
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,860
That was too close for comfort.

1157
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:27,080
Wait.

1158
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:29,780
I need to go up.

1159
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:31,180
I need to go up here.

1160
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:34,640
I don't even know.

1161
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,240
You guys, we might be going towards a totally...

1162
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,640
We might be going down the most difficult path and we don't even realize it.

1163
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:49,540
Oh, I'm scared.

1164
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:02,030
First try.

1165
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:11,900
Watch it go 76 to 3 or something.

1166
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,860
Even if it does...

1167
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,300
Honestly, Atlantis no Nazo is such a mystery.

1168
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:22,420
The numbers just don't really count, I think.

1169
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:25,380
It's just... It's just a mystery.

1170
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:34,520
Honestly, it doesn't even matter what the order is as long as you make it to 100.

1171
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:44,440
But what horrors does level 100 have in this game?

1172
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,820
Level 100, you have to have invincibility in the original.

1173
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,240
So I'm scared.

1174
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,060
I'm scared!

1175
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:03,590
Zombie.

1176
01:13:04,490 --> 01:13:05,690
That's a zombie!

1177
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:07,730
Die zombie!

1178
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,450
Die zombie!

1179
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,490
Die zombie!

1180
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,160
Die zombie.

1181
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:21,860
Oh gosh.

1182
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:26,700
Oh gosh.

1183
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,420
OK, we are back everybody.

1184
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:33,300
We are back with a full set of lives.

1185
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:45,280
So maybe we can make it.

1186
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,180
Minky power!

1187
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,840
OK, I have to have this one in sight and...

1188
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,940
This one in sight and...

1189
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:57,820
Oh shit!

1190
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,180
No!

1191
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:01,020
No!

1192
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:10,820
The timing on that...

1193
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,720
At least it wasn't a fall.

1194
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:17,220
Mervy!

1195
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,340
I blame you!

1196
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:38,180
I wonder how you get... I wonder how you get the skins.

1197
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,060
See, you have Minto.

1198
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:41,840
You have a Chilly.

1199
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:43,820
You have Space.

1200
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:44,860
You have a Mermaid.

1201
01:14:45,540 --> 01:14:46,960
You have Hotdog.

1202
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,160
You have Otaku.

1203
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:50,080
You have Idol.

1204
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,540
You have Snow.

1205
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:53,100
You have a Bunny.

1206
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:54,800
You have a Jiangshi.

1207
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:56,180
You have Mummy.

1208
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:58,000
You have a Solid.

1209
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,780
You have a Nude.

1210
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,860
You have a Lilac.

1211
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:04,180
Oh my gosh!

1212
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,640
Wait!

1213
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:06,920
Mid 3.0!

1214
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:07,800
Oh my gosh!

1215
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:07,980
Wait!

1216
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,280
We have Turquoise too!

1217
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:12,320
30% more ear.

1218
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:14,500
50% less eye.

1219
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:19,320
OK, we'll do that one.

1220
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:24,480
We have more ear.

1221
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,300
Punished Minto.

1222
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:26,080
That was close I think.

1223
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:30,660
No!

1224
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:31,360
I knew it.

1225
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,760
When I went for it I was like wait, I'm not close enough to the edge.

1226
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,380
I'm not close enough to the edge.

1227
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,040
See how fast that second bat was?

1228
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,360
How do we go in with a full set of lives?

1229
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:06,680
OK

1230
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:42,690
Oh shoot!

1231
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:57,560
How is that cheating?

1232
01:17:57,780 --> 01:17:58,600
What are you talking about?

1233
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,100
This is how you play the game!

1234
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:02,200
What?

1235
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:02,680
Cheating?

1236
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:03,420
My butt!

1237
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:04,640
This is how you play the game!

1238
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:17,420
OK

1239
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:50,490
At least it's not very hard to get back here.

1240
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:54,350
I just want to make it through!

1241
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,970
What in the parkour ship is this place?

1242
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,990
I want to be a parkour master!

1243
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:06,570
Oh gosh!

1244
01:19:38,930 --> 01:19:43,050
Once again, I'm exploiting the game's mechanics.

1245
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:48,530
Once again, I'm exploiting the game's mechanics.

1246
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:55,390
I'm exploiting the game's mechanics.

1247
01:20:03,870 --> 01:20:04,830
AKA cheating.

1248
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:09,530
You guys have never played Atlantis No Nazo and it clearly shows right now.

1249
01:20:09,850 --> 01:20:20,750
Your gaming inexperience is really coming to full light right now you guys.

1250
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:21,750
It's a little embarrassing.

1251
01:20:22,930 --> 01:20:26,510
Maybe play some big boy games and then come back to me, OK?

1252
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,600
Oh shoot!

1253
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:47,620
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

1254
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,380
Albert Einstein.

1255
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:00,560
Please, don't get me!

1256
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,700
Oh my god, that was close.

1257
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:12,660
The random pattern on the birds is bullshit.

1258
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:13,540
I know!

1259
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:16,200
It's so rude!

1260
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:20,080
I wish I had the glide here.

1261
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:23,420
I can't believe you lose the power-ups.

1262
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:33,640
My

1263
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:41,130
tippy toes!

1264
01:21:41,510 --> 01:21:43,550
My tippy toes were touching the tip!

1265
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:52,910
My tippy toes were just right on the block, man!

1266
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:00,290
Sometimes I hate my controller.

1267
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:01,470
I don't know if it's me.

1268
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,490
I mean sure, blame me.

1269
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:05,410
But I am pressing the button.

1270
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,590
I am pressing the button.

1271
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,810
I am pressing jump.

1272
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,050
I promise you!

1273
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:16,730
And I'm holding it down!

1274
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:17,970
I'm holding it down!

1275
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:21,510
No!

1276
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,080
How old were you when it came out, Atlantis Nozzle Master?

1277
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,200
What are you talking about?

1278
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,820
I still beat it.

1279
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:42,240
Try jumping over.

1280
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:43,520
You can't!

1281
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:44,680
There is no time.

1282
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,480
There is no time to jump over the bats.

1283
01:22:52,850 --> 01:22:54,570
At least the first one.

1284
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:56,690
You might be able to jump over the second ones.

1285
01:23:03,620 --> 01:23:04,140
Money.

1286
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:05,720
Oh wait, not this way.

1287
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,500
I wonder though.

1288
01:23:07,860 --> 01:23:08,660
I wonder!

1289
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:10,680
Maybe here?

1290
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,680
Maybe down there?

1291
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:16,800
Maybe here?

1292
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,520
No, maybe here?

1293
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,200
Maybe here?

1294
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:39,530
Maybe here?

1295
01:23:40,270 --> 01:23:45,370
How do I make it so it doesn't...there we go.

1296
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:47,690
Nothing really!

1297
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:50,890
Okay.

1298
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:55,130
I thought...

1299
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,690
You thought...

1300
01:23:57,690 --> 01:23:58,610
I thought...

1301
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:03,790
I thought...

1302
01:24:08,790 --> 01:24:09,750
Where is the try?

1303
01:24:19,490 --> 01:24:20,130
Actually...

1304
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:23,990
Am I stuck in a loop?

1305
01:24:33,450 --> 01:24:34,730
Come on!

1306
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:36,350
What's over here?

1307
01:24:36,630 --> 01:24:38,030
What's on the other side?

1308
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:41,310
What if I just...LEAP OF FAITH!

1309
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:49,250
Everybody, I tested it for you.

1310
01:24:49,290 --> 01:24:50,410
I know you were all so curious.

1311
01:24:51,470 --> 01:24:54,010
There is nothing...oh wait, I'm in the 1th zone.

1312
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,290
Oh my God!

1313
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:57,170
Get me out of here please!

1314
01:25:01,540 --> 01:25:01,840
Oh no!

1315
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:02,300
No, no, no!

1316
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:02,980
Please get me out of here!

1317
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:03,940
Please, please, please, please!

1318
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,660
Please, please, please, please!

1319
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,780
I don't want to be here!

1320
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:07,740
No, no, no!

1321
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:09,700
Please!

1322
01:25:09,940 --> 01:25:10,480
Oh God!

1323
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:11,060
I did it again!

1324
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:12,100
No, no, no!

1325
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:12,320
Please!

1326
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,200
They are coming for me!

1327
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:13,780
They are coming for me!

1328
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:14,600
Oh my God!

1329
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:14,860
Please!

1330
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,420
They are coming for me!

1331
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:17,460
They are coming for me!

1332
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:24,740
And...go.

1333
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:25,340
Okay, there we go.

1334
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:27,740
Alrighty.

1335
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,720
The 1th zone.

1336
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:35,820
The 1th zone.

1337
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,900
The 2th zone.

1338
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,860
BabyCorn, thanks for the gift!

1339
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,260
Thank you!

1340
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,900
The 1st zone.

1341
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:50,300
The 2th zone.

1342
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:51,660
Why?

1343
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,300
Where is the bone zone?

1344
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:54,660
Give us what we want!

1345
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,980
Give the people what they want!

1346
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:03,820
Send us to the bone zone!

1347
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,280
A fan made this?

1348
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:11,640
Yeah!

1349
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,680
It's so good!

1350
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,220
In like a horrible way.

1351
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,440
Like it's so accurate.

1352
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,320
We hate that.

1353
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,440
I was like, surely this will be...oh my God.

1354
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:29,380
It will be so...you know.

1355
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:31,820
Not easy, but like...

1356
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:35,800
Nobody wants to play Atlantis No Nazo.

1357
01:26:39,220 --> 01:26:39,740
Nobody...

1358
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,900
Nobody wants to play Atlantis No Nazo for real.

1359
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,440
This is just going to make you...

1360
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:51,300
Every time...you guys are just going to get mad at me.

1361
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:54,020
You guys are just going to be like...God.

1362
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:58,060
Actually he made another game too.

1363
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:59,200
Gibby.

1364
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:00,600
Sorry, I call you Gibby.

1365
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:04,860
But...

1366
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,720
But...and it's so good actually.

1367
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,000
I kind of...I was like...I kind of want to...

1368
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,860
If I hadn't just...

1369
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:19,140
You know, if I hadn't just gotten this new BGM for my intro...

1370
01:27:19,140 --> 01:27:23,620
I feel like I would have used it instead.

1371
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:24,380
It's so good.

1372
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,560
Mistyping of the dead.

1373
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:25,860
Yeah!

1374
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:31,320
This game reminds me of McKids on NES.

1375
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:33,000
McKids.

1376
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,000
What are the McKids McPlaying?

1377
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,100
Why are they playing Atlantis No Nazo?

1378
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:40,120
Toughest game ever.

1379
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:47,940
Can you leave?

1380
01:27:48,200 --> 01:27:48,560
Thank you.

1381
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:49,940
Oh my God!

1382
01:27:49,960 --> 01:27:50,660
On his head!

1383
01:27:51,740 --> 01:27:52,380
Cute.

1384
01:27:57,980 --> 01:27:59,440
Yarn for the Nazo.

1385
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:00,440
You know what guys?

1386
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,320
Oh my gosh.

1387
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:04,860
I am going to try...

1388
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,080
Not dying here.

1389
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:08,500
There we go.

1390
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,860
I'm going to try...

1391
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,240
The 8th level.

1392
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,460
Over here.

1393
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:17,100
But with the glide.

1394
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:20,260
It might be fine if we have the glide.

1395
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:21,620
You know?

1396
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:27,540
Oh.

1397
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:04,540
I lost it.

1398
01:29:07,680 --> 01:29:11,300
I was double pressing and I was like why is it not working?

1399
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:31,740
You didn't realize?

1400
01:29:32,620 --> 01:29:34,340
I thought it was user error.

1401
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:35,320
I'll be honest.

1402
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,160
Oh my God!

1403
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:49,500
Wait!

1404
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:51,520
It's not that they are invisible.

1405
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:52,780
They just aren't there!

1406
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,380
It's not that the blocks aren't visible.

1407
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,280
They just disappear!

1408
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:58,300
Oh no.

1409
01:29:58,420 --> 01:29:59,040
This is...no.

1410
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:00,260
There is no way.

1411
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,340
What's the point?

1412
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:02,860
See?

1413
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,100
They just aren't there!

1414
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,180
That's craziness!

1415
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,560
Oh my God!

1416
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,240
I thought they were invisible blocks.

1417
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,360
I thought this would be doable.

1418
01:30:32,540 --> 01:30:33,580
Only 15?

1419
01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:35,140
I was just curious.

1420
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:38,080
We are not actually going to play on easy mode you guys.

1421
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:39,000
I was just...

1422
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:40,860
Wait.

1423
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,340
I was just curious.

1424
01:30:44,240 --> 01:30:47,780
Like how many lives...like what's the difference between easy mode, you know?

1425
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:49,180
That's all.

1426
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,200
I wasn't actually going to do it.

1427
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:52,180
I don't play easy mode.

1428
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,540
That would be stupid.

1429
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,540
I wish this game had save states.

1430
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:03,080
If anything.

1431
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:07,020
Give me a checkpoint please.

1432
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,320
Maybe we go back to the streets.

1433
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:15,020
I'm sick of the birds.

1434
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:16,640
I believe in us.

1435
01:31:17,380 --> 01:31:18,840
We can handle the streets.

1436
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:20,080
We can handle ourselves.

1437
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,080
We are not a kid anymore.

1438
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:25,200
How did we get to the streets?

1439
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:29,080
How did we get to the American...

1440
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,760
How did we get to McDonald's?

1441
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,240
Is it this way?

1442
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:37,860
How did we get there?

1443
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,300
He's losing it.

1444
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:44,560
He's losing it!

1445
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:53,440
It wasn't...

1446
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:54,700
Through the wisp zone.

1447
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,500
Okay, never mind.

1448
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:56,780
You know what?

1449
01:31:56,820 --> 01:31:58,560
I love...

1450
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:01,280
I love the birds.

1451
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,880
Excuse me zombie.

1452
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,480
I'm a bit of a time limit.

1453
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:06,900
Thank you.

1454
01:32:06,900 --> 01:32:07,680
Thank you.

1455
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:18,380
I

1456
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:31,160
think one of the hardest parts about this game is remembering when I have to do a short jump and when to do a long jump.

1457
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,180
Like the different types of jumps.

1458
01:32:36,260 --> 01:32:38,020
It feels like Jump King in that regard.

1459
01:32:38,020 --> 01:32:39,300
Oh my god.

1460
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:44,500
I saw someone do a speedrun of the Not Jump King in Holocure.

1461
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:47,540
And I think I'm just gonna follow them.

1462
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,080
Nice.

1463
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,440
I'm a baseball player.

1464
01:32:53,660 --> 01:32:58,140
I think I'm just gonna see what they do for their...

1465
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,240
For their things.

1466
01:33:02,240 --> 01:33:02,580
For their things.

1467
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:08,560
Their jump strengths, you know.

1468
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:15,640
Wait, you saw a 3 minute one?

1469
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:16,600
I saw...

1470
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,380
I saw one that was 5 minutes.

1471
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:20,400
Please, please, please.

1472
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:20,840
Okay, good.

1473
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:27,260
And down we go.

1474
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:30,740
Wait, when do I lose the ghost?

1475
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:35,220
When do I lose the jump ability?

1476
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,340
Or the glide ability?

1477
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:37,640
Because I still have it.

1478
01:33:37,700 --> 01:33:39,340
I thought it was when I fell down the hole.

1479
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,020
Looks like after 3 deaths.

1480
01:33:49,100 --> 01:33:50,720
Only when you fall into a pit.

1481
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,260
Then maybe I'll be okay here.

1482
01:33:57,940 --> 01:33:58,380
What?

1483
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,500
There's a 3 minute task run.

1484
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,200
Oh, task runs are no fun.

1485
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,320
Eating Mike Tyson's ass!

1486
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:07,560
Thank you for the 5, Captain!

1487
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,980
Oh, I do still have it.

1488
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:25,040
Concentration.

1489
01:34:25,040 --> 01:34:25,860
Concentration, everybody.

1490
01:34:41,410 --> 01:34:42,050
The

1491
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,780
birds.

1492
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,080
Wait, these aren't birds.

1493
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:52,700
They're bats.

1494
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:56,580
I've been calling them birds this whole time.

1495
01:35:02,580 --> 01:35:04,240
They're not even birds.

1496
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,300
Okay, next one.

1497
01:35:09,500 --> 01:35:10,280
There we go.

1498
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,100
Okay, so jump over them?

1499
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,720
I'm too scared.

1500
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:19,060
Okay, I have the timing though.

1501
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,380
It's just this first one.

1502
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:28,900
Shoot.

1503
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:30,860
Okay, hold on.

1504
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:35,200
Wrong.

1505
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:35,860
Wrong.

1506
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:36,480
There we go.

1507
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:39,320
Too far.

1508
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:40,200
There we go.

1509
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:45,160
I think gliding will definitely kill me here.

1510
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:47,240
I think.

1511
01:35:53,700 --> 01:35:55,140
No way!

1512
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:57,060
Oh my God.

1513
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:09,290
Messed up.

1514
01:36:09,810 --> 01:36:10,830
Messed up.

1515
01:36:10,910 --> 01:36:13,990
There was never two of them standing right next to each other before.

1516
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:39,640
Screw it.

1517
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,000
Sorry, I'm resetting.

1518
01:36:42,120 --> 01:36:42,720
I'm resetting!

1519
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,840
Doesn't feel like a Kusoge so far.

1520
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,420
Nah, not at all.

1521
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:04,800
Of course it wouldn't feel like a Kusoge.

1522
01:37:05,360 --> 01:37:06,280
I'm in it.

1523
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,540
Nothing that I'm in is a Kusoge.

1524
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:28,070
Oh my God!

1525
01:37:28,150 --> 01:37:30,270
I can't make this heckin' jump!

1526
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,440
Parkour is truly...

1527
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:02,580
If this was Minecraft Parkour...

1528
01:38:02,580 --> 01:38:04,760
I'd be able to double jump.

1529
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,940
I'd be able to... I'd be able to do everything.

1530
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:19,070
Shoot!

1531
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,480
I'd be able to jump 360.

1532
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,280
If this was...

1533
01:38:35,860 --> 01:38:38,260
If this was Minecraft.

1534
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,260
Tellin' ya.

1535
01:38:44,940 --> 01:38:46,220
Always jump for the beef.

1536
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,380
I'm so sad.

1537
01:38:51,440 --> 01:38:52,960
I saw people say that they got that.

1538
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:54,260
That they jump for the beef.

1539
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:54,840
What the?

1540
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:55,460
Oh my gosh.

1541
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:55,720
No.

1542
01:38:56,380 --> 01:38:56,780
Please.

1543
01:38:57,400 --> 01:38:58,080
On their thing.

1544
01:38:58,220 --> 01:39:01,360
But mine didn't... I watched Parkour 7 and mine didn't have it.

1545
01:39:07,460 --> 01:39:10,380
At least I didn't die.

1546
01:39:15,180 --> 01:39:19,860
I'm gonna run out of time.

1547
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:28,760
Yeah, I have float, but...

1548
01:39:41,740 --> 01:39:45,800
Oh gosh.

1549
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:51,000
I feel I'm gonna hear this song in my sleep.

1550
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,000
Next one.

1551
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,380
And once you glide, you can't stop gliding.

1552
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:15,740
I think that's...

1553
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:21,860
Like there's no... I think I can't use glide here, because once I glide...

1554
01:40:21,860 --> 01:40:23,640
I will just go past the block.

1555
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:27,620
Well, I lost my glide.

1556
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:28,480
You know what?

1557
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,600
I don't even want it!

1558
01:40:30,820 --> 01:40:32,480
I don't even want the glide!

1559
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:33,740
I don't need it!

1560
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,960
I don't need you!

1561
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:36,240
I don't love you!

1562
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:38,000
I don't want you in my life!

1563
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:52,720
I definitely thought that said glide is for rabies instead of glide is for babies.

1564
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:17,660
Why does the timing change?

1565
01:41:30,730 --> 01:41:31,830
I miss glide.

1566
01:41:33,850 --> 01:41:35,130
I miss having the option.

1567
01:41:35,870 --> 01:41:38,210
Even if I never use it, I at least have the option.

1568
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:39,670
I miss having options.

1569
01:41:42,690 --> 01:41:44,350
I miss having options.

1570
01:41:49,950 --> 01:41:53,050
Can't help but feel guilty with how much your suffering makes me laugh.

1571
01:41:53,130 --> 01:41:53,650
Sorry, Minky.

1572
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:54,630
That's OK.

1573
01:41:54,930 --> 01:41:56,070
That's why I do these things.

1574
01:41:56,750 --> 01:42:01,790
It's like a little bit of schadenfreude that you feel.

1575
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:05,710
Dummy VTuber.

1576
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:08,030
She tries so hard and always fails.

1577
01:42:09,510 --> 01:42:10,470
I hope she fails more.

1578
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:11,530
You know what?

1579
01:42:11,850 --> 01:42:15,670
It's so funny when VTubers fail, because I am a winner.

1580
01:42:16,890 --> 01:42:18,510
And her failure means I'm winning.

1581
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:20,590
Look at her.

1582
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:22,030
She screams at the screen.

1583
01:42:23,770 --> 01:42:24,570
Dummy VTuber.

1584
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:27,030
Dummy VTuber, don't you know that it's a skill issue?

1585
01:42:27,590 --> 01:42:28,310
Dummy VTuber.

1586
01:42:29,330 --> 01:42:31,390
Why do you yell so loud when it's your fault?

1587
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:35,450
Oh gosh.

1588
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:39,970
I'll never play this game and I'll never be able to know how good or bad I am at this game.

1589
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:45,670
But I know that I'm the greatest and I would be able to beat Dummy VTuber in anything.

1590
01:42:50,170 --> 01:42:50,970
Dummy VTuber.

1591
01:42:51,410 --> 01:42:53,430
She started with 15 lives.

1592
01:42:53,490 --> 01:42:54,490
Only 4 lives left.

1593
01:42:55,790 --> 01:42:56,750
Why does she keep trying?

1594
01:42:57,570 --> 01:42:58,070
You know what?

1595
01:42:58,110 --> 01:43:00,290
I like when she falls and dies and screams.

1596
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:03,250
It really gives my life meaning.

1597
01:43:05,170 --> 01:43:06,590
Die again, Dummy VTuber.

1598
01:43:06,810 --> 01:43:07,650
Die again.

1599
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:09,210
I want to see her suffering.

1600
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:11,890
I want to see her suffering and all the hope drain from your eyes.

1601
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:17,310
Look at her.

1602
01:43:17,550 --> 01:43:18,630
She screamed again.

1603
01:43:20,730 --> 01:43:21,990
Dummy VTuber.

1604
01:43:22,910 --> 01:43:24,590
She did exactly what I wanted.

1605
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:27,410
She died for my entertainment.

1606
01:43:34,840 --> 01:43:36,620
VTuber fell down the hole.

1607
01:43:36,780 --> 01:43:37,480
I clapped.

1608
01:43:37,480 --> 01:43:37,680
I clapped.

1609
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,600
Single cell organism.

1610
01:43:45,020 --> 01:43:46,240
That's what a VTuber is.

1611
01:43:47,240 --> 01:43:49,140
They have no brain cell to work upon.

1612
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:02,740
Doesn't the Dummy VTuber know that she has to change her habits for something new to happen?

1613
01:44:03,040 --> 01:44:05,960
Instead, Dummy VTuber does the same thing over and over again.

1614
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,180
That's why Dummy VTuber dies.

1615
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:11,940
Oh, Dummy VTuber.

1616
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:13,840
You simple being.

1617
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:17,280
I love watching a single cell organism try to be sentient.

1618
01:44:17,680 --> 01:44:18,760
Isn't it just so funny?

1619
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:22,300
Try, try as you might, Dummy VTuber, but you'll never make it.

1620
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:56,640
One HP in a dream.

1621
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:58,240
Try dumping...jumping.

1622
01:44:58,700 --> 01:44:59,120
Dumping?

1623
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,000
I

1624
01:45:16,770 --> 01:45:18,230
didn't mean to say that.

1625
01:45:27,330 --> 01:45:28,450
Dump o'clock.

1626
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:34,990
You guys, if I get past this next room, can we call it?

1627
01:45:36,350 --> 01:45:38,930
Can we call that I beat the game?

1628
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:41,930
Oh, I didn't...

1629
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:45,870
No,

1630
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,530
everybody who said no was too slow.

1631
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,490
Everybody who said no, we are way too slow.

1632
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:55,270
Everybody said yes first.

1633
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:59,670
Yes was the first answer I saw.

1634
01:45:59,850 --> 01:46:00,590
You guys are too slow.

1635
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:11,770
You have more experience in X-No-Nazo games than me.

1636
01:46:12,250 --> 01:46:14,350
So try dumping, might be the way.

1637
01:46:16,110 --> 01:46:17,250
Minto, are you okay?

1638
01:46:17,630 --> 01:46:18,590
Are you okay, Minto?

1639
01:46:19,330 --> 01:46:20,450
Minto, are you okay?

1640
01:46:20,810 --> 01:46:21,510
Are you okay?

1641
01:46:22,090 --> 01:46:23,270
Are you okay, Minto?

1642
01:46:25,230 --> 01:46:26,210
Dumpy VTuber.

1643
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:27,390
Oh my gosh!

1644
01:46:27,710 --> 01:46:28,870
I didn't see that guy.

1645
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:30,050
He blended in with the wall.

1646
01:46:34,190 --> 01:46:35,590
Alright.

1647
01:46:43,550 --> 01:46:45,310
Steal the money.

1648
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:45,370
Steal the money.

1649
01:46:55,070 --> 01:46:56,270
Definitely dumpy.

1650
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:58,590
I saw it in the Phantography tag.

1651
01:46:58,890 --> 01:46:59,450
I know!

1652
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:04,870
My hashtag has been getting...it's been difficult to retweet stuff.

1653
01:47:05,250 --> 01:47:07,090
Because I'm like, but it's in my hashtag.

1654
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:10,510
So, like, do I retweet it?

1655
01:47:10,570 --> 01:47:13,590
But it's like, it's getting very racy up in there.

1656
01:47:13,650 --> 01:47:14,090
And I'm like...

1657
01:47:15,130 --> 01:47:19,730
But this should be, maybe, I do have an 80 plus tag, you guys!

1658
01:47:20,090 --> 01:47:21,390
People are not using it.

1659
01:47:23,410 --> 01:47:27,570
If it were Snake, he'd just get a mouthful of these bats and say, disgusting.

1660
01:47:28,070 --> 01:47:29,110
It's so true.

1661
01:47:31,250 --> 01:47:35,170
Just rolled through a toll booth with my speakers blasting your Monster Mash cover.

1662
01:47:35,330 --> 01:47:37,570
Oh wait, I saw that ashes just now.

1663
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:43,640
What do you mean?

1664
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:45,740
He's green, but his shirt is purple.

1665
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:47,900
I don't look at people's faces.

1666
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:48,740
I'm too small.

1667
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:53,380
And I don't give them the satisfaction of looking up at them.

1668
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:59,320
If I'm small, I'm not giving you the satisfaction of looking up at your face.

1669
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,540
That hurts my neck.

1670
01:48:03,660 --> 01:48:06,040
So I'm just used to looking down at people.

1671
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:09,760
Earth coin!

1672
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:11,080
Thank you so much for the 10 gifted!

1673
01:48:11,620 --> 01:48:12,660
I got it, right?

1674
01:48:14,260 --> 01:48:14,800
Wait...

1675
01:48:17,820 --> 01:48:18,360
Nice.

1676
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:19,420
Safe.

1677
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:25,600
Here we go!

1678
01:48:27,660 --> 01:48:28,880
So we draw a butt.

1679
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:38,800
I'll be honest, of course there's gonna be some things I retweet, but for the most part, if it gets too bad, I'll just like it to show that I saw it.

1680
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,860
I won't retweet it.

1681
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,860
Because, you know...

1682
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:59,500
Some people check Twitter, aka me, I check Twitter in public and stuff.

1683
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:04,240
Or if you check it at work and all.

1684
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:12,390
I at least try to like everything.

1685
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:17,210
When I get around to it.

1686
01:49:19,630 --> 01:49:20,270
Alright.

1687
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:25,390
Dummy VTuber, back out again in the dummy room.

1688
01:49:29,050 --> 01:49:30,550
There we go.

1689
01:49:57,630 --> 01:50:00,570
This is why you don't give me the glide option, everybody.

1690
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:09,270
Wait, I can't check.

1691
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:11,590
I want a time limit!

1692
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:13,750
The timing is too tight!

1693
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,700
You've been hit by, you've been hit by, not a brick, a bat.

1694
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:51,040
You've been hit by a bat.

1695
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,740
I'm too scared, gosh.

1696
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:05,460
Ah shoot.

1697
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:21,510
Oh

1698
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:42,810
the misery.

1699
01:51:43,610 --> 01:51:45,730
Every bat is my enemy.

1700
01:51:51,470 --> 01:51:51,970
Oh

1701
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:56,320
the misery.

1702
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,360
Every bat is my...my enemy!

1703
01:52:00,360 --> 01:52:02,800
I was right there!

1704
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:07,100
My hitbox is like 2 pixels.

1705
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,680
Let me out of this room.

1706
01:52:22,860 --> 01:52:23,780
That was crazy.

1707
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:26,180
Why did they put me in a room full of bats?

1708
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:27,840
The bats made me crazy!

1709
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,240
Sorry, I was actually...you can blame Ducky for that.

1710
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,160
I was reading your donut.

1711
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:47,100
The hitbox contains the Ahoge.

1712
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,040
But it's invisible?

1713
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,820
I wonder if my neighbors can ever hear me.

1714
01:53:31,540 --> 01:53:33,440
I got new neighbors recently.

1715
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:40,720
I'm like, did the old ones move out because just randomly they would hear me screaming and crying.

1716
01:53:41,340 --> 01:53:43,560
They're like, this place is really haunted.

1717
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,660
What?

1718
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:51,960
This is super dead.

1719
01:53:54,220 --> 01:53:57,960
I feel like we hear the wails of a ghost.

1720
01:53:59,700 --> 01:54:00,840
It moans.

1721
01:54:01,560 --> 01:54:04,580
Pixel Minto will have PTSD.

1722
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:08,400
Thank you for the pink zype!

1723
01:54:24,870 --> 01:54:27,310
I can't get the timing anymore!

1724
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:29,950
I had it!

1725
01:54:30,570 --> 01:54:32,210
I had it!

1726
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:47,510
At the edge of the world.

1727
01:54:48,030 --> 01:54:48,330
See?

1728
01:54:48,570 --> 01:54:49,650
I have to wait.

1729
01:54:49,650 --> 01:54:49,750
Wait.

1730
01:54:53,170 --> 01:54:55,150
The second guy comes too fast.

1731
01:54:56,630 --> 01:54:58,310
Oh my god, that was so close.

1732
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:27,900
Just a little...

1733
01:55:27,900 --> 01:55:30,900
This really makes it...

1734
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:32,920
It just really...

1735
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:36,120
Really solidifies it.

1736
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:38,240
Gibby, is this what you wanted?

1737
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:40,900
Of all fangames...

1738
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,080
Are you a sadist?

1739
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,740
Of all fangames...

1740
01:55:46,740 --> 01:55:47,260
Why?

1741
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:48,860
Why this?

1742
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,300
Why Atlantis don't nozzle?

1743
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:52,540
Why?

1744
01:56:03,900 --> 01:56:04,340
What?

1745
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,440
The game was updated less than 10 minutes ago.

1746
01:56:50,460 --> 01:56:51,420
What are you talking about?

1747
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:52,000
Why?

1748
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:53,340
What did they do?

1749
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,120
What did they add?

1750
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:56,480
Did they add a Minto mod?

1751
01:57:19,220 --> 01:57:20,660
It's all bats now.

1752
01:57:27,280 --> 01:57:28,780
Oh my god, that would be incredible.

1753
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:30,000
Can you imagine?

1754
01:57:33,860 --> 01:57:36,680
OK, reset, reset.

1755
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:38,560
Reset, reset.

1756
01:57:42,060 --> 01:57:44,200
Wait, I want to see what the update is.

1757
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:46,100
Hold on, let me get the link.

1758
01:57:46,940 --> 01:57:49,260
It would be incredible if it was all bats.

1759
01:57:55,180 --> 01:57:56,040
Where does it say?

1760
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:56,980
Oh, 8 minutes ago.

1761
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:17,580
69 lives!

1762
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:21,540
Invincible to enemies, but you cannot pick up skins.

1763
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:23,940
Which I have two...

1764
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,080
It's called explorer mode though.

1765
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,760
It's not called Minto mode everybody.

1766
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,220
It's because I'm an explorer.

1767
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:41,600
I'm a lover.

1768
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,720
And a licker.

1769
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,320
That's how my mom describes my dog.

1770
01:58:57,100 --> 01:59:03,670
And I think my dog was a little adventurer.

1771
01:59:15,620 --> 01:59:19,300
Sing us a song, little batman.

1772
01:59:25,510 --> 01:59:26,910
Dog.

1773
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:42,240
Thank you, thank you.

1774
01:59:45,160 --> 01:59:45,580
Choo.

1775
01:59:47,740 --> 01:59:49,980
Honk mimimi honk choo.

1776
01:59:51,560 --> 01:59:54,120
Oh my gosh, I can't even make the jump though.

1777
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,560
I feel like the timing to jump over the bats is scarier than jumping...

1778
02:00:10,360 --> 02:00:11,300
between them.

1779
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:11,840
I don't know.

1780
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,360
Bus mirror Fuji.

1781
02:00:30,860 --> 02:00:31,980
Must be nice.

1782
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
I wish...actually there is a Fuji world.

1783
02:00:36,200 --> 02:00:36,920
It's in the thumbnail.

1784
02:00:38,380 --> 02:00:40,220
I wish I could go to that world.

1785
02:00:40,720 --> 02:00:42,040
I wish to go to there.

1786
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,940
I wish to go to that Fuji world.

1787
02:00:44,940 --> 02:00:45,100
Fuji world.

1788
02:00:50,450 --> 02:00:53,080
I wish to go to there.

1789
02:00:54,900 --> 02:00:56,680
Oh god.

1790
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,810
This music just sounds so sad.

1791
02:01:16,150 --> 02:01:17,750
Game over.

1792
02:01:24,780 --> 02:01:26,520
New version out.

1793
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:32,720
Oh wait.

1794
02:01:37,460 --> 02:01:39,060
You know what guys?

1795
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:39,980
I've paid my dues.

1796
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:42,900
I've paid my dues.

1797
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:43,580
You know?

1798
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:44,600
I have.

1799
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:45,820
I've paid my dues.

1800
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:46,560
I've...

1801
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:56,750
I've played...honestly...what am I thinking of playing this again?

1802
02:01:58,270 --> 02:02:01,270
I've paid...I also...I did everything...

1803
02:02:07,530 --> 02:02:08,790
I do want to show you though.

1804
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:12,610
I do want to show you Giova's other game though.

1805
02:02:13,210 --> 02:02:13,890
Give me a second.

1806
02:02:14,130 --> 02:02:14,950
Let me pull it out.

1807
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:17,430
Because I'm going to play it in the browser.

1808
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:20,670
One second.

1809
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:21,130
One second.

1810
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:27,350
There we go.

1811
02:02:30,650 --> 02:02:32,050
I like how...oh my gosh.

1812
02:02:32,110 --> 02:02:36,370
It even matches my gaming background right now.

1813
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:43,960
Reese, thank you for the super chat.

1814
02:02:44,860 --> 02:02:45,680
Hey Minto, you did great.

1815
02:02:45,740 --> 02:02:46,920
Can't wait for you to beat it one day.

1816
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:52,240
I promise...no, hold on.

1817
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:53,440
Let me rephrase this.

1818
02:02:57,560 --> 02:02:59,780
I...I...I want to go back to the bathroom.

1819
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,040
I just want a break.

1820
02:03:03,080 --> 02:03:05,840
And I one day want to beat it.

1821
02:03:06,220 --> 02:03:07,580
Maybe not on stream.

1822
02:03:08,820 --> 02:03:10,120
I'm tired today.

1823
02:03:10,380 --> 02:03:12,240
I've been having crazy dreams.

1824
02:03:12,960 --> 02:03:17,220
The dream I had last night was like...oh my god.

1825
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:18,440
It was weird.

1826
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:23,480
I was like...I was basically playing...I was Phoenix Wright.

1827
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:30,480
And...there was a guy who was like being framed for something.

1828
02:03:30,740 --> 02:03:33,840
And I was having to come to his defense and I was like, I don't know anything.

1829
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,500
I'm not a lawyer.

1830
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:45,940
And he's just like, Minto I can only count on you because everybody has painted me out to be this real bad guy.

1831
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:51,220
And he was just like, I only became what they thought that I was.

1832
02:03:51,240 --> 02:03:53,460
If they thought I was this, so I became that.

1833
02:03:53,740 --> 02:03:59,780
And I was just like, I don't know buddy, maybe you...I don't know...but what's your alibi?

1834
02:04:00,080 --> 02:04:03,280
And he's just like, I can't tell you.

1835
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:03,940
I'm like...

1836
02:04:09,200 --> 02:04:11,320
Made it through all five stages of grief.

1837
02:04:11,460 --> 02:04:14,140
Look, a fan game made for the streamer Mint Phantom.

1838
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:14,900
That's me.

1839
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,520
Inspired by her lack of auto-correct.

1840
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:21,640
But you guys, the song is actually...this is so funny too.

1841
02:04:21,880 --> 02:04:26,720
The developer is not endorsed or affiliated with Mint Phantom, Minto Corp, or any of its talents.

1842
02:04:26,860 --> 02:04:28,240
Mint, Chili, Lilac, etc.

1843
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:33,740
All Phantom Productions talents are 2020 Minto Corp.

1844
02:04:36,460 --> 02:04:37,540
It's so silly.

1845
02:04:38,500 --> 02:04:41,400
Yeah, the song in this is so good.

1846
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:44,300
Like Gibby, did you make this song?

1847
02:04:44,380 --> 02:04:45,380
Did you remix it yourself?

1848
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:51,680
I kind of want to switch my...my...my...what's it called?

1849
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:55,840
My screen, my loading music with it.

1850
02:04:57,980 --> 02:05:00,360
I'm going to turn it down a bit, and then we can adjust.

1851
02:05:00,680 --> 02:05:01,260
So, run game.

1852
02:05:02,740 --> 02:05:04,620
Oh my gosh, Kodoa, I was just talking about Phoenix Wright.

1853
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:09,740
I don't hear anything.

1854
02:05:11,600 --> 02:05:12,560
I don't hear anything.

1855
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,500
Let's do medium.

1856
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:20,660
It's my...it's my...it's my typing.

1857
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:24,640
How...how...how...you know medium is normal mode, right?

1858
02:05:28,820 --> 02:05:29,860
Hey!

1859
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,680
Auto...oh no!

1860
02:05:36,560 --> 02:05:37,480
Shit!

1861
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:38,520
Oh no!

1862
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:38,860
Wait!

1863
02:05:44,620 --> 02:05:48,340
Why did I ever say this?

1864
02:05:53,320 --> 02:05:54,040
Orca!

1865
02:05:59,290 --> 02:06:00,590
Oh, we changed...

1866
02:06:02,090 --> 02:06:04,810
Polycure and Licky!

1867
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:08,530
Say all

1868
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:25,660
this!

1869
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:26,600
Why?

1870
02:07:14,780 --> 02:07:15,480
Donkey!

1871
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,180
Oh, Egg.

1872
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,300
Why did I say this?

1873
02:07:36,830 --> 02:07:37,910
Socks yourself!

1874
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:40,270
Socks yourself!

1875
02:07:41,690 --> 02:07:44,330
Isn't this the best song remix ever?

1876
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:46,050
It's so good.

1877
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:50,390
This is my favorite part of it.

1878
02:08:03,260 --> 02:08:04,940
We're doing awesome guys!

1879
02:08:05,780 --> 02:08:07,320
I'm good at this game!

1880
02:08:12,180 --> 02:08:13,440
We're good at this game!

1881
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:19,080
Shut up!

1882
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:21,980
See, this I can do.

1883
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:42,020
Is this like regressing my...my typing ability, you know?

1884
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:50,760
Like, because...Oh my God, Deer Stage!

1885
02:08:54,260 --> 02:08:55,740
What was I saying in these?

1886
02:08:55,900 --> 02:08:57,360
Like, what am I trying to say?

1887
02:08:59,580 --> 02:09:00,720
I don't even know.

1888
02:09:01,040 --> 02:09:01,480
Ogla.

1889
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,860
I wonder if there's an ending.

1890
02:09:08,920 --> 02:09:10,560
I'll have a...

1891
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:11,520
Ok, that's Mourning.

1892
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:13,420
Oh, like Owl?

1893
02:09:13,660 --> 02:09:14,040
Ok.

1894
02:09:14,620 --> 02:09:15,740
I don't know what that is.

1895
02:09:20,570 --> 02:09:24,290
I actually just...just think...Oh my God!

1896
02:09:24,730 --> 02:09:25,070
Oh

1897
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,380
my God, it's the boss!

1898
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:41,540
So I send up typing letters that will be in the future and I also don't go back and correct

1899
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:47,640
a mistake.

1900
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:52,720
I feel so free without auto-correct.

1901
02:09:53,060 --> 02:09:55,180
I'm never going back!

1902
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:13,430
It's impressive that my accuracy was 91%.

1903
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:18,590
I can do it!

1904
02:10:19,210 --> 02:10:23,110
I wonder what hard mode is.

1905
02:10:23,850 --> 02:10:25,230
There's insane mode.

1906
02:10:26,130 --> 02:10:26,690
Also...

1907
02:10:26,690 --> 02:10:27,130
I love this.

1908
02:10:27,150 --> 02:10:27,930
You can have the instrumental.

1909
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:29,490
Wait, is it just my normal song?

1910
02:10:31,910 --> 02:10:33,330
Oh, it's the same?

1911
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:35,290
I think they're just faster.

1912
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:53,850
Oh God!

1913
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:54,330
Oh God!

1914
02:10:54,370 --> 02:10:54,950
It's hard!

1915
02:10:56,170 --> 02:10:57,250
Sucks yourself!

1916
02:10:57,250 --> 02:10:57,330
No!

1917
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:04,450
I love this...what's it called?

1918
02:11:09,430 --> 02:11:10,890
Like...I'm gonna die!

1919
02:11:37,680 --> 02:11:39,660
Anime Operator, it's your birthday tomorrow!

1920
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:42,760
Happy birthday to you!

1921
02:11:43,260 --> 02:11:45,200
Happy birthday to you!

1922
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:48,420
Happy birthday Anime Operator!

1923
02:11:48,520 --> 02:11:51,040
Happy birthday to you!

1924
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,900
Happy birthday!

1925
02:11:54,360 --> 02:11:55,660
I love the backgrounds too.

1926
02:11:55,740 --> 02:11:57,880
Oh my gosh, Gibi, you did such a great job with this one.

1927
02:11:59,680 --> 02:12:01,700
I'm obsessed with the remix though.

1928
02:12:03,260 --> 02:12:05,800
I was saying when it's just the instrumental it's like...

1929
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:07,960
Oh my gosh, what are they called?

1930
02:12:09,580 --> 02:12:10,020
The...

1931
02:12:11,120 --> 02:12:14,320
For some reason my brain keeps saying speedrun, but that's not it.

1932
02:12:14,860 --> 02:12:17,560
You know when they just pitch...

1933
02:12:17,560 --> 02:12:18,100
Nightcore!

1934
02:12:18,240 --> 02:12:19,300
Yes, Nightcore!

1935
02:12:19,460 --> 02:12:20,040
Thank you.

1936
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:23,040
The Nightcore version.

1937
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,480
No, but the lyrics are so good.

1938
02:12:26,740 --> 02:12:28,780
You need to use that as your intro.

1939
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,440
It's so good, right?

1940
02:12:31,120 --> 02:12:35,360
I'm trying to figure out, because I really love what I have now.

1941
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:36,980
And obviously this is based on that.

1942
02:12:37,480 --> 02:12:39,000
Or like it uses that song.

1943
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:43,920
But I don't want, you know... I got Mitsukiyo, you guys.

1944
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:47,520
Oh, it's so good though, this version.

1945
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:50,960
I just went here, let's just listen to it.

1946
02:13:09,190 --> 02:13:09,670
Soju!

1947
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,480
How did you find me saying all these things?

1948
02:13:33,440 --> 02:13:35,650
Also, are you turning the...

1949
02:13:36,100 --> 02:13:37,360
Oh no, Dan.

1950
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:38,560
I'm gonna cry.

1951
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:41,360
Are you turning the...

1952
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,430
The sex shop here...

1953
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,960
Into a minto shop.

1954
02:13:47,740 --> 02:13:49,240
Why Walt Disney?

1955
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:58,860
You don't even know who Ocelot is.

1956
02:14:09,270 --> 02:14:10,630
That's too good.

1957
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:17,880
Oh, there's the Mr. Donuts too!

1958
02:14:19,900 --> 02:14:23,300
This is such a nice walk of Akiba, it's so good.

1959
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:27,720
I like that it ends at...

1960
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:32,720
At Deer Stage.

1961
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,860
I'm so obsessed with this fog.

1962
02:14:39,440 --> 02:14:41,780
I've always wanted a...

1963
02:14:44,480 --> 02:14:45,040
A...

1964
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:46,640
Like an otomad of me.

1965
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:47,960
So I'm so happy.

1966
02:14:51,380 --> 02:14:53,060
Why is shit up in here though?

1967
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:54,300
I'm so embarrassed about that.

1968
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:19,790
I'm so obsessed.

1969
02:15:27,020 --> 02:15:28,260
One more time!

1970
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:29,620
There we go.

1971
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:32,160
This is different.

1972
02:15:48,940 --> 02:15:50,600
I'm way slower this time.

1973
02:16:43,680 --> 02:16:44,700
Yeah!

1974
02:16:46,940 --> 02:16:48,460
So good.

1975
02:16:49,460 --> 02:16:50,400
So good.

1976
02:16:54,630 --> 02:16:56,280
She hates those!

1977
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:04,680
Maple, thank you for this...

1978
02:17:04,680 --> 02:17:05,620
7 months?

1979
02:17:05,700 --> 02:17:06,520
I almost said 9 months.

1980
02:17:06,560 --> 02:17:07,120
Thank you!

1981
02:17:07,340 --> 02:17:08,280
Oh my gosh, that reminds me.

1982
02:17:08,320 --> 02:17:09,000
I have to get little...

1983
02:17:09,520 --> 02:17:10,840
I have to get new things.

1984
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:14,060
We're gonna be at 1 year before we know it.

1985
02:17:15,260 --> 02:17:15,860
Oh wait.

1986
02:17:16,780 --> 02:17:18,560
I was thinking in 3 more months.

1987
02:17:18,940 --> 02:17:20,940
No, there's 12 months.

1988
02:17:21,500 --> 02:17:21,940
Nevermind.

1989
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:24,860
Oh wait, there's some people that are above 7 months.

1990
02:17:25,380 --> 02:17:27,500
Oh no, I have to give one for a year.

1991
02:17:29,380 --> 02:17:30,500
The member badges.

1992
02:17:30,760 --> 02:17:31,860
Yeah, the member badges.

1993
02:17:33,180 --> 02:17:35,020
The cadence of Kojumbo does it again.

1994
02:17:35,080 --> 02:17:35,720
It's amazing.

1995
02:17:36,380 --> 02:17:38,480
I'm so happy to have this Otome.

1996
02:17:38,680 --> 02:17:39,460
Thank you.

1997
02:17:39,540 --> 02:17:40,680
So good.

1998
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,520
Slave Monster, no!

1999
02:17:55,560 --> 02:17:57,440
Maple Wolfie, thank you for the superchat.

2000
02:17:57,560 --> 02:17:58,200
Oh my gosh.

2001
02:17:59,500 --> 02:18:00,540
No, oh no.

2002
02:18:01,340 --> 02:18:01,780
I

2003
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:10,390
can make one right now.

2004
02:18:10,750 --> 02:18:11,150
You know what?

2005
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:11,930
I'm gonna make one right...

2006
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:16,600
for one year.

2007
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:19,880
For one year you get...

2008
02:18:20,720 --> 02:18:21,840
One moment please.

2009
02:18:22,800 --> 02:18:23,400
One moment.

2010
02:18:23,840 --> 02:18:27,400
You get my chat.

2011
02:18:27,740 --> 02:18:29,000
It scared the hell out of me.

2012
02:18:29,300 --> 02:18:29,960
Oh my god.

2013
02:18:32,960 --> 02:18:34,840
It scared me so bad.

2014
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:38,360
Let's see.

2015
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,100
Okay, hold on.

2016
02:18:42,900 --> 02:18:44,780
I'm fixing the thing.

2017
02:18:45,960 --> 02:18:46,840
Nice stats.

2018
02:18:47,780 --> 02:18:49,100
I don't even look.

2019
02:18:49,300 --> 02:18:50,680
I just have it open for chat.

2020
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:54,800
It's usually covered by whatever I'm playing.

2021
02:18:55,680 --> 02:18:57,960
Right now it's covered by...

2022
02:18:57,960 --> 02:18:58,800
Oh wait, hold on.

2023
02:18:59,940 --> 02:19:00,940
Nope, not settings.

2024
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:03,860
Covered by Microsoft Paint.

2025
02:19:06,620 --> 02:19:07,260
Alright.

2026
02:19:07,260 --> 02:19:09,820
Oh, nope.

2027
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:11,420
That's the entire screen.

2028
02:19:12,080 --> 02:19:12,960
Okay, hold on.

2029
02:19:13,340 --> 02:19:13,540
Alright.

2030
02:19:14,980 --> 02:19:16,040
Alright guys.

2031
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:19,940
Alright guys, let's make a one year...

2032
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:22,100
One year badge.

2033
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:24,600
What should it be?

2034
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,600
What should the one year badge be?

2035
02:19:30,400 --> 02:19:31,300
Hello there.

2036
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:31,780
Hello!

2037
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:33,240
Made them so strong.

2038
02:19:47,220 --> 02:19:48,220
This idea suck.

2039
02:19:48,240 --> 02:19:49,100
What do you mean a wisp?

2040
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:50,260
Oh, I was going to say...

2041
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:56,300
It's a wisp right now, but no, it's a little Ghostbusters thing.

2042
02:19:59,180 --> 02:19:59,840
Let's see.

2043
02:20:04,760 --> 02:20:05,100
Paintbrush?

2044
02:20:06,620 --> 02:20:07,820
Large size.

2045
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:10,520
Actually, we need larger size.

2046
02:20:11,140 --> 02:20:12,460
The largest you got, ma'am.

2047
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:15,020
Why is my mouse lagging?

2048
02:20:15,160 --> 02:20:15,580
You see this?

2049
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:16,360
This one?

2050
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:20,620
Oh, it stops going after a while.

2051
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:22,380
Wait, this one.

2052
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:24,440
Okay.

2053
02:20:26,600 --> 02:20:28,220
I'm going to make it a badge.

2054
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:29,780
A badge of honor.

2055
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:36,580
Wow, that's a really good circle.

2056
02:20:36,900 --> 02:20:39,060
Okay, I have to do it again though, because I have to make it darker.

2057
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:43,660
Stay in the lines, Minto.

2058
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:45,160
Stay in the lines.

2059
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,380
Stay in the lines.

2060
02:20:48,400 --> 02:20:48,760
Nice.

2061
02:20:48,880 --> 02:20:50,160
Oh here, I'm going to put on some BGM.

2062
02:20:53,100 --> 02:20:54,300
Putting on some BGM.

2063
02:21:02,580 --> 02:21:03,740
Got to work setting out.

2064
02:21:03,860 --> 02:21:04,920
Thank you Mike!

2065
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:09,160
Oh, so loud on this one.

2066
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:14,580
There we go.

2067
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:19,170
Okay, okay.

2068
02:21:20,290 --> 02:21:23,030
I got to make it even darker, so you can see it, you know?

2069
02:21:24,170 --> 02:21:25,430
Now, this is temporary.

2070
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:28,010
I'll get real ones made...

2071
02:21:28,930 --> 02:21:29,390
Eventually.

2072
02:21:29,670 --> 02:21:30,650
Don't worry about it.

2073
02:21:31,850 --> 02:21:33,970
I'll get real ones made eventually.

2074
02:21:35,730 --> 02:21:37,490
Okay, I'm just going to keep going around.

2075
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:39,510
It kind of looks like a beard.

2076
02:21:45,630 --> 02:21:46,150
Okay.

2077
02:21:46,450 --> 02:21:47,350
Oh, sorry.

2078
02:21:49,810 --> 02:21:50,330
Okay.

2079
02:21:50,490 --> 02:21:51,030
Oh, sorry.

2080
02:21:51,510 --> 02:21:52,830
I didn't realize it was still spraying.

2081
02:21:53,530 --> 02:21:55,410
Okay, so that's the badge.

2082
02:21:56,910 --> 02:21:57,990
That's the badge.

2083
02:21:58,370 --> 02:22:00,370
And that is going to say...

2084
02:22:02,550 --> 02:22:03,070
One...

2085
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:13,060
I guess I can only just say one.

2086
02:22:13,940 --> 02:22:17,900
I was going to write one here, but I think just one is good.

2087
02:22:17,900 --> 02:22:20,820
Like, it could be... I'm number one what?

2088
02:22:21,220 --> 02:22:21,560
You know?

2089
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:24,400
Give a grab, welcome to membership.

2090
02:22:24,600 --> 02:22:25,320
Thank you!

2091
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:27,900
One.

2092
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:36,420
And...

2093
02:22:40,440 --> 02:22:41,340
What else?

2094
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:43,560
Number.

2095
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:49,060
Number one year.

2096
02:22:58,320 --> 02:22:59,600
If one, why two?

2097
02:22:59,660 --> 02:23:01,660
No, this is one year.

2098
02:23:01,660 --> 02:23:02,340
One year.

2099
02:23:03,460 --> 02:23:06,960
And then I'm going to draw a picture of me giving a thumbs up.

2100
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:12,320
Right?

2101
02:23:31,940 --> 02:23:33,620
Really big thumbs up.

2102
02:23:36,650 --> 02:23:37,610
Like that.

2103
02:23:38,730 --> 02:23:39,910
Okay, now how do I... Okay.

2104
02:23:40,470 --> 02:23:40,950
Ears.

2105
02:23:43,290 --> 02:23:44,310
And hair.

2106
02:24:18,290 --> 02:24:22,310
But I'm going to be a wisp body because I can't draw anything else.

2107
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:24,970
And...

2108
02:24:25,850 --> 02:24:27,010
Here's your tombstone.

2109
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:05,060
Oh, it's a thumbs up.

2110
02:25:05,200 --> 02:25:06,660
Here, I'll put a thumbnail on it.

2111
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:07,440
Oh, sorry, not a thumbnail.

2112
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:08,740
Wait.

2113
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:10,740
Yeah, thumbnail.

2114
02:25:11,540 --> 02:25:12,880
I was thinking of a toenail.

2115
02:25:14,260 --> 02:25:15,000
Yeah, there you go.

2116
02:25:15,080 --> 02:25:15,260
See?

2117
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,000
It's my thumbnail.

2118
02:25:19,720 --> 02:25:23,360
It's a big old thumbs up for being number one here.

2119
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:27,880
And...

2120
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:29,520
Let's see.

2121
02:25:29,640 --> 02:25:31,440
Dead stands... It's not dead.

2122
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:35,720
It stands for...

2123
02:25:35,720 --> 02:25:42,380
Doing every almost deed, including being number one here.

2124
02:25:48,460 --> 02:25:51,580
I think I have to make it smaller for YouTube to like it.

2125
02:25:51,860 --> 02:25:52,960
Okay, now I save.

2126
02:25:55,140 --> 02:25:56,080
One year.

2127
02:25:56,640 --> 02:25:57,740
Alright, let's see.

2128
02:25:59,160 --> 02:26:00,880
Thumbs up for one year dead!

2129
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:05,580
This is just like one of my Japanese animes.

2130
02:26:06,560 --> 02:26:09,300
Alright, now I go to...

2131
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:13,080
YouTube.com And I go to...

2132
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:18,080
I go to...

2133
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:20,900
The...

2134
02:26:23,080 --> 02:26:23,380
Custom...

2135
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:24,280
How do I go?

2136
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:24,560
Oh.

2137
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:25,400
Earn.

2138
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:27,760
I go to memberships.

2139
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:29,300
I go to levels.

2140
02:26:29,840 --> 02:26:30,660
No, not levels.

2141
02:26:30,780 --> 02:26:32,140
I go to...

2142
02:26:32,140 --> 02:26:33,320
Customize perks.

2143
02:26:34,220 --> 02:26:35,640
I go to...

2144
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:37,060
One year.

2145
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:41,400
Save.

2146
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:43,280
Oh my god!

2147
02:26:43,780 --> 02:26:44,660
Is there anybody?

2148
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:45,280
Oh my gosh.

2149
02:26:45,280 --> 02:26:46,460
Refresh the page.

2150
02:26:46,500 --> 02:26:47,560
I'm gonna refresh my page.

2151
02:26:52,980 --> 02:26:54,940
Oh my gosh, is there anyone here?

2152
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,660
Anyone here in chat?

2153
02:27:01,550 --> 02:27:01,950
Any?

2154
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:07,970
No.

2155
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:20,640
Wait, you're my bot.

2156
02:27:21,320 --> 02:27:22,520
You do not count.

2157
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:28,920
Phantom-san, do you speak Japanese?

2158
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:30,140
Do you speak Japanese?

2159
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,720
I can speak a little.

2160
02:27:34,320 --> 02:27:35,080
A little.

2161
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:37,940
I see you.

2162
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:39,280
I see you!

2163
02:27:39,420 --> 02:27:40,040
Thank you!

2164
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:46,700
Wait, where are you?

2165
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:48,960
Fake day!

2166
02:27:50,020 --> 02:27:53,080
Everything is loading so slowly for some reason.

2167
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:54,640
Thank you.

2168
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:56,980
Yay!

2169
02:27:57,780 --> 02:27:58,860
It's so small.

2170
02:27:59,100 --> 02:27:59,860
No, it's perfect.

2171
02:28:04,340 --> 02:28:05,040
Yay!

2172
02:28:05,900 --> 02:28:06,200
Yay!

2173
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:10,320
Who upjorked in there once?

2174
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:14,280
You're doing that!

2175
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:17,420
Should I add that on the badge?

2176
02:28:18,140 --> 02:28:18,940
Let's see.

2177
02:28:20,180 --> 02:28:21,180
Here, hold on.

2178
02:28:24,580 --> 02:28:25,980
Straight...

2179
02:28:38,700 --> 02:28:39,520
Jorkin...

2180
02:28:41,520 --> 02:28:42,340
One.

2181
02:28:49,960 --> 02:28:51,580
Straight jorkin one.

2182
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:55,440
Till I'm dead!

2183
02:28:56,480 --> 02:28:57,200
Yeah!

2184
02:29:05,100 --> 02:29:07,540
We should fill in some space here.

2185
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:08,440
What should we put here?

2186
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:09,880
Wow!

2187
02:29:10,040 --> 02:29:10,520
VHD!

2188
02:29:14,020 --> 02:29:15,300
Let's go!

2189
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:21,880
Add snake there?

2190
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,920
I'm using tiny snake as a reference.

2191
02:29:29,920 --> 02:29:32,260
The rise of the old wisp.

2192
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,300
Let's see.

2193
02:29:50,540 --> 02:29:52,000
That's his beard.

2194
02:29:57,910 --> 02:29:58,730
Side patch.

2195
02:30:05,310 --> 02:30:06,630
His bandana.

2196
02:30:08,150 --> 02:30:09,430
His tuft of hair.

2197
02:30:11,370 --> 02:30:12,790
His actual hair.

2198
02:30:25,530 --> 02:30:25,930
Wait, no!

2199
02:30:26,370 --> 02:30:28,410
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2200
02:30:37,480 --> 02:30:39,300
Maybe not straight jorkin.

2201
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:41,800
I know what to do.

2202
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:47,100
I know what to put instead.

2203
02:30:48,720 --> 02:30:49,100
I know.

2204
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:52,960
Struck with inspiration just now.

2205
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:05,750
You become the jorker.

2206
02:31:06,950 --> 02:31:08,210
We live in a society.

2207
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:24,520
I already took a screenshot of me with...

2208
02:31:25,060 --> 02:31:25,420
No!

2209
02:31:25,900 --> 02:31:26,880
No, the other one, no!

2210
02:31:27,280 --> 02:31:28,380
This is the real one!

2211
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:36,450
That's life, that's life.

2212
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:38,670
Something, something, something.

2213
02:31:40,290 --> 02:31:44,670
Sometimes you're dead, sometimes you're straight jorkin it.

2214
02:31:45,250 --> 02:31:50,150
But I'm gonna be the number one jorker.

2215
02:31:50,510 --> 02:31:52,690
It's gonna be me.

2216
02:31:52,690 --> 02:31:54,590
That's afterlife.

2217
02:31:56,790 --> 02:31:58,830
The jorker is crazy.

2218
02:31:59,610 --> 02:32:01,690
Yeah, the jorker.

2219
02:32:05,510 --> 02:32:08,510
And then here, you know what this is?

2220
02:32:09,370 --> 02:32:10,170
Society.

2221
02:32:22,900 --> 02:32:25,260
We don't live in it because we're dead!

2222
02:32:26,860 --> 02:32:28,360
We don't live in a society.

2223
02:32:28,920 --> 02:32:30,540
We're dead in a society.

2224
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:40,960
Who loves jorking their snake while they're whispering?

2225
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:48,160
Straight up becoming the jorker.

2226
02:32:49,360 --> 02:32:51,140
Okay, now I save this.

2227
02:32:51,920 --> 02:32:53,240
Okay, now I change it.

2228
02:32:53,620 --> 02:32:54,120
I go back.

2229
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:00,180
Replace image.

2230
02:33:01,300 --> 02:33:02,280
Alright, save and publish.

2231
02:33:02,280 --> 02:33:04,600
Alright, our masterpiece.

2232
02:33:04,780 --> 02:33:06,380
You guys, this is just temporary.

2233
02:33:08,500 --> 02:33:10,120
This is just temporary.

2234
02:33:11,160 --> 02:33:14,280
I wanna get ones for the other months too, so...

2235
02:33:17,980 --> 02:33:19,340
So don't worry.

2236
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:24,600
Why is it hashed after number one?

2237
02:33:25,600 --> 02:33:29,760
Because I wrote one first and then I didn't have enough room.

2238
02:33:33,610 --> 02:33:34,610
Snake jorker?

2239
02:33:34,750 --> 02:33:36,850
No, that's snake beater.

2240
02:33:42,870 --> 02:33:44,490
I want it to stay.

2241
02:33:44,690 --> 02:33:47,430
We'll get to one year and then we'll re-decide, okay?

2242
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:49,430
We'll re-think about it.

2243
02:33:51,150 --> 02:33:53,010
You guys probably won't even remember.

2244
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:56,550
You guys are probably gonna be like, what was this again?

2245
02:33:56,550 --> 02:34:03,880
Well guys, I...

2246
02:34:06,140 --> 02:34:09,670
I think I'm gonna end it here.

2247
02:34:09,830 --> 02:34:11,090
It's a bit of a shorter stream.

2248
02:34:13,830 --> 02:34:16,630
But I am so sleepy after...

2249
02:34:18,930 --> 02:34:19,390
After...

2250
02:34:20,410 --> 02:34:21,510
Phantom No Nazo.

2251
02:34:21,670 --> 02:34:23,090
But I'm glad we could play both games.

2252
02:34:24,470 --> 02:34:27,450
I'm still... I'm so shocked that this game was so difficult.

2253
02:34:27,450 --> 02:34:31,190
That it was actually so much like the original.

2254
02:34:32,690 --> 02:34:33,910
I'm so shocked.

2255
02:34:34,010 --> 02:34:35,090
Takezo, thanks for the 500.

2256
02:34:37,270 --> 02:34:38,930
Kevin, thanks for the super chat.

2257
02:34:42,950 --> 02:34:44,730
Tomorrow might be a bit longer.

2258
02:34:44,890 --> 02:34:47,510
Tomorrow and Saturday might be a bit longer stream, so...

2259
02:34:48,410 --> 02:34:50,030
I think it's harder than Atlantis No Nazo.

2260
02:34:52,410 --> 02:34:54,750
Truly, Gibby did his homework.

2261
02:34:54,750 --> 02:34:55,450
Yeah.

2262
02:34:56,510 --> 02:34:58,070
Game was really well done.

2263
02:34:58,130 --> 02:34:59,350
It really was.

2264
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:01,110
Like...

2265
02:35:01,690 --> 02:35:03,750
In terms of being a...

2266
02:35:05,030 --> 02:35:06,970
A replica of the original.

2267
02:35:07,330 --> 02:35:07,630
Yeah.

2268
02:35:10,410 --> 02:35:11,170
Oyasuminasai.

2269
02:35:12,130 --> 02:35:12,890
Oyasuminasai.

2270
02:35:16,410 --> 02:35:18,190
Maomao, thanks for the 5 gifted.

2271
02:35:19,230 --> 02:35:20,870
Yeah, so tomorrow...

2272
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:23,870
I think we decided for...

2273
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:27,850
The collab on Sunday, I can say, I think...

2274
02:35:27,850 --> 02:35:30,770
Is going to be the Sloppy Sisters again.

2275
02:35:32,150 --> 02:35:36,170
I invited them to play Buckshot Roulette with me.

2276
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:40,550
So, oh my gosh, Liars Bar and Buckshot Roulette in the same week.

2277
02:35:42,470 --> 02:35:44,710
Oh, Snuffy mentioned it yesterday.

2278
02:35:48,250 --> 02:35:49,450
Yeah, so...

2279
02:35:50,070 --> 02:35:52,350
The four of us will be playing that.

2280
02:35:52,350 --> 02:35:54,530
I really want to play...

2281
02:35:54,530 --> 02:35:58,350
Limu, I found out she really likes Lethal Company.

2282
02:35:58,950 --> 02:36:01,010
And I always want to play more Lethal Company.

2283
02:36:02,190 --> 02:36:05,550
For those who are part of the...

2284
02:36:05,550 --> 02:36:06,370
Oh wait, hold on.

2285
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:07,330
Hold on.

2286
02:36:08,830 --> 02:36:11,030
Let me double check when I'm doing that.

2287
02:36:11,510 --> 02:36:13,350
Yeah, for those who are part of the...

2288
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:16,350
Who were, I guess...

2289
02:36:16,350 --> 02:36:16,830
The...

2290
02:36:16,830 --> 02:36:21,050
The Patreon.

2291
02:36:22,130 --> 02:36:23,950
Next week, I'll have a stream.

2292
02:36:26,470 --> 02:36:28,470
Wait, what time am I streaming tomorrow?

2293
02:36:29,810 --> 02:36:30,610
Oh, kind of early.

2294
02:36:31,270 --> 02:36:32,630
I gotta record some stuff.

2295
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:35,270
I have to record some stuff.

2296
02:36:38,350 --> 02:36:39,590
And then...

2297
02:36:39,590 --> 02:36:42,310
From next month, probably.

2298
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:45,670
Because Matara will be coming next week.

2299
02:36:45,670 --> 02:36:48,650
So next week is a little busy with her.

2300
02:36:49,270 --> 02:36:52,510
And then the week after is December.

2301
02:36:53,070 --> 02:36:55,670
So starting next month...

2302
02:36:56,210 --> 02:36:58,590
There will be more membership streams.

2303
02:37:01,930 --> 02:37:06,750
If you're just like, Man, Minto doesn't really do many membership streams.

2304
02:37:07,070 --> 02:37:09,670
The reason I haven't done so many is because...

2305
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:12,170
I...

2306
02:37:12,170 --> 02:37:16,030
Besides because we had the podcast in the beginning...

2307
02:37:16,030 --> 02:37:19,790
Is because I've been out of town so often...

2308
02:37:19,790 --> 02:37:22,810
That I'm always just wanting to stream on my main channel...

2309
02:37:22,810 --> 02:37:23,680
To show that I'm actually...

2310
02:37:24,550 --> 02:37:26,270
I'm like, YouTube couldn't look at me.

2311
02:37:26,530 --> 02:37:27,850
I'm actually making content.

2312
02:37:27,990 --> 02:37:30,110
Please, don't kick me out of the algorithm.

2313
02:37:31,690 --> 02:37:32,760
So I'm like...

2314
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:33,900
So I'm like...

2315
02:37:34,470 --> 02:37:35,760
It's hard to like...

2316
02:37:36,190 --> 02:37:39,390
It was hard to balance when I could do membership.

2317
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:41,870
And I also...

2318
02:37:42,550 --> 02:37:45,030
Don't like doing them on days where...

2319
02:37:45,030 --> 02:37:46,290
Like on weekdays.

2320
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:50,730
And I have had my weekends filled with so much stuff.

2321
02:37:52,090 --> 02:37:52,690
So...

2322
02:37:52,690 --> 02:37:53,670
But I think...

2323
02:37:54,230 --> 02:37:58,170
When things like that happen, I think I'm just gonna try and...

2324
02:37:58,170 --> 02:38:00,630
Get two streams in one day.

2325
02:38:02,170 --> 02:38:04,890
I think it might be easier to do.

2326
02:38:05,610 --> 02:38:06,550
Get me out of the algorithm!

2327
02:38:07,890 --> 02:38:09,470
My brain is not braining.

2328
02:38:10,330 --> 02:38:13,030
How's there some one-year memberships already within seven months?

2329
02:38:14,070 --> 02:38:16,130
By the way, I got a name suggestion for you and Doki.

2330
02:38:16,210 --> 02:38:17,310
The Sloppy Bandits.

2331
02:38:20,270 --> 02:38:23,330
It's like the Sticky Bandits from Home Alone 2, but sloppy.

2332
02:38:23,670 --> 02:38:24,530
I like it.

2333
02:38:25,950 --> 02:38:27,890
And the reason there's some one-year members...

2334
02:38:27,890 --> 02:38:29,930
Is because they were members...

2335
02:38:29,930 --> 02:38:31,790
Way back...

2336
02:38:31,790 --> 02:38:33,170
In 2020.

2337
02:38:33,790 --> 02:38:36,170
When I had memberships open...

2338
02:38:36,770 --> 02:38:37,150
Initially.

2339
02:38:37,630 --> 02:38:38,170
And so...

2340
02:38:39,390 --> 02:38:42,530
It kind of just carried over the months.

2341
02:38:45,470 --> 02:38:47,210
It carried over the months...

2342
02:38:47,810 --> 02:38:49,510
From when they were...

2343
02:38:49,990 --> 02:38:53,330
When they were members back when I originally streamed.

2344
02:38:53,410 --> 02:38:54,230
The OGs.

2345
02:38:54,310 --> 02:38:55,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2346
02:38:55,690 --> 02:38:58,710
I never realized that it carried over.

2347
02:38:58,930 --> 02:39:00,210
Yeah, before I went to heaven.

2348
02:39:02,870 --> 02:39:03,370
So...

2349
02:39:03,370 --> 02:39:05,220
Honestly, I want to make something...

2350
02:39:06,970 --> 02:39:09,650
So awesome for you guys.

2351
02:39:09,970 --> 02:39:12,830
For that, because I can't believe you guys are even still here.

2352
02:39:15,330 --> 02:39:18,090
You guys are even still watching me.

2353
02:39:18,170 --> 02:39:18,890
That's insane.

2354
02:39:26,120 --> 02:39:27,180
I never left.

2355
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:28,720
Yeah, you've been here a while too, Jeremy.

2356
02:39:34,420 --> 02:39:34,920
Craziness.

2357
02:39:37,100 --> 02:39:38,600
How did yesterday's meeting go?

2358
02:39:38,980 --> 02:39:40,060
Oh, it was so great!

2359
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:42,200
Yeah, thanks for asking.

2360
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:43,680
I can't tell you anything about it though.

2361
02:39:44,460 --> 02:39:46,140
But you'll know...

2362
02:39:46,140 --> 02:39:48,400
Not too long from now actually, I think.

2363
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:52,000
Actually...

2364
02:39:52,800 --> 02:39:53,300
No.

2365
02:39:59,820 --> 02:40:00,800
I can't say.

2366
02:40:06,660 --> 02:40:07,620
Meeting went good.

2367
02:40:08,140 --> 02:40:09,220
You'll never be rid of us.

2368
02:40:11,120 --> 02:40:12,760
Oh, look, Lilybreeze.

2369
02:40:13,160 --> 02:40:13,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2370
02:40:14,200 --> 02:40:14,980
Look who's streaming.

2371
02:40:15,140 --> 02:40:16,540
Look who's not gone!

2372
02:40:18,240 --> 02:40:20,240
Tell us something, we are dying here.

2373
02:40:32,650 --> 02:40:33,150
No.

2374
02:40:39,800 --> 02:40:41,600
Is Mitara still coming over for Thanksgiving?

2375
02:40:41,720 --> 02:40:42,820
She is, yeah.

2376
02:40:43,920 --> 02:40:46,800
We plan on streaming at least once...

2377
02:40:46,800 --> 02:40:47,100
Together.

2378
02:40:48,780 --> 02:40:49,300
Yeah, yeah.

2379
02:40:50,280 --> 02:40:52,660
It's kind of difficult because...

2380
02:40:52,660 --> 02:40:54,320
My mom wants to go out...

2381
02:40:54,320 --> 02:40:55,220
For Thanksgiving.

2382
02:40:56,120 --> 02:40:57,300
Do stuff, so...

2383
02:40:59,720 --> 02:41:01,300
But I will...

2384
02:41:02,680 --> 02:41:04,760
Obviously let you guys know when that is.

2385
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:08,540
Poker Night!

2386
02:41:08,720 --> 02:41:10,120
Welcome to Bamboo Ship Vacuum!

2387
02:41:10,880 --> 02:41:12,720
I'm here since your debut, silly ghostman.

2388
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:13,840
I know!

2389
02:41:15,060 --> 02:41:16,060
So wait, since my debut?

2390
02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:16,180
You?

2391
02:41:23,510 --> 02:41:23,910
Why?

2392
02:41:24,210 --> 02:41:24,330
Why?

2393
02:41:25,950 --> 02:41:26,350
Why?

2394
02:41:31,670 --> 02:41:34,330
So cool to see how folks keep raising the bar of famworks.

2395
02:41:34,650 --> 02:41:35,790
Truly you're a great muse.

2396
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:37,590
Thanks, Tom!

2397
02:41:44,280 --> 02:41:46,320
Thank you for the spooky dodo, Aichi!

2398
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,380
I want to say I visited a lot of places from your Akiba Mid Tour a few months ago...

2399
02:41:51,380 --> 02:41:52,000
And had a lot of fun.

2400
02:41:52,300 --> 02:41:55,160
To your stage in Akiba Zettai Ryuki were two of my favorites that I frequented.

2401
02:41:55,160 --> 02:41:56,780
I have many tickets now.

2402
02:41:59,700 --> 02:42:02,880
Can you leak your recipe for sweet potato casserole?

2403
02:42:02,980 --> 02:42:04,740
I'm in charge of some dishes this Thanksgiving.

2404
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:06,400
I was going to try making it.

2405
02:42:07,980 --> 02:42:09,720
It's my mom's recipe.

2406
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:11,640
I can ask her.

2407
02:42:13,540 --> 02:42:15,280
I'll ask her, Nana.

2408
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:23,660
I don't think it's anything so special though.

2409
02:42:29,450 --> 02:42:30,810
I don't think it's so special.

2410
02:42:33,350 --> 02:42:37,110
But I told my mom she has to make it because Matara asked about it.

2411
02:42:37,450 --> 02:42:39,530
But Matara was just like, I don't really like sweet stuff.

2412
02:42:40,310 --> 02:42:43,170
My mom puts marshmallows in it, so...

2413
02:42:44,490 --> 02:42:45,250
I don't know.

2414
02:42:47,070 --> 02:42:47,970
Did I miss the game?

2415
02:42:48,330 --> 02:42:49,070
Sorry, Nipples.

2416
02:42:49,910 --> 02:42:51,090
You missed the whole stream.

2417
02:42:52,030 --> 02:42:52,690
I'm ending!

2418
02:42:52,690 --> 02:42:52,870
I'm ending!

2419
02:42:54,830 --> 02:42:57,370
Thank you guys for hanging out with me tonight!

2420
02:42:58,890 --> 02:43:03,030
I will see you when I see you next.

2421
02:43:03,850 --> 02:43:07,350
Get some water and have a good night.

2422
02:43:07,430 --> 02:43:08,410
Have a good day.

2423
02:43:08,710 --> 02:43:09,990
Get some rest.

2424
02:43:10,150 --> 02:43:11,150
We're almost to the weekend.

2425
02:43:13,130 --> 02:43:14,970
The weekend's in like two days.

2426
02:43:17,190 --> 02:43:17,750
Otamito!

2427
02:43:18,590 --> 02:43:19,510
Thank you, thank you.

2428
02:43:20,390 --> 02:43:21,430
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

2429
02:43:25,730 --> 02:43:26,450
Bye bye!

2430
02:43:27,550 --> 02:43:29,530
Do you guys want to help me make a video real quick?

2431
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:36,020
Let's make a video together that I'm going to post online.

2432
02:43:40,470 --> 02:43:41,830
Actually, it might take more than a minute.

2433
02:43:42,510 --> 02:43:42,950
You know what?

2434
02:43:43,570 --> 02:43:44,730
I'll just catch you guys later.

2435
02:43:44,910 --> 02:43:46,010
You'll see it when I post it.

2436
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:53,940
You'll see it when I post it.

2437
02:43:55,200 --> 02:43:56,880
Fakeny, thanks for the superchat!

2438
02:43:57,560 --> 02:43:58,080
Okay.

2439
02:43:58,880 --> 02:43:59,380
Bye bye!

2440
02:44:03,660 --> 02:44:05,900
Sorry for the bait and switch.

2441
02:44:06,280 --> 02:44:07,720
Sorry, sorry.

2442
02:44:07,860 --> 02:44:08,380
I'll see you.

2443
02:44:08,440 --> 02:44:09,180
You'll see it.

2444
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:11,360
It's probably not even that...

2445
02:44:13,860 --> 02:44:14,380
But...

2446
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:17,200
Don't worry about it.

2447
02:44:20,120 --> 02:44:21,160
Don't worry.

2448
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:23,740
This is a dumb idea.

2449
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:25,280
I came up with it this morning.

2450
02:44:25,280 --> 02:44:27,260
I was like, I'm going to make this into a video.

2451
02:44:30,080 --> 02:44:30,880
I'm going to...

2452
02:44:31,720 --> 02:44:33,080
I'm going to post it online!

2453
02:44:34,300 --> 02:44:35,580
I'm going to post it online!
