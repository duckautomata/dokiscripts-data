1
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,640
Hey...

2
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,210
Hey...

3
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,730
Hey is for horses!

4
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,550
Happy Freaky Friday!

5
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,510
Freaky, freaky, freaky.

6
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,990
Freaky, get freaky.

7
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,830
Hot dog, freaky, freaky, freaky.

8
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:31,850
I was listening to your stream in the background a few nights ago while cramming and today I'm proud to say I passed the test!

9
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,490
Let's go Ray!

10
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,570
Freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky, freaky.

11
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,310
I just played a freaky game and now I'm scared.

12
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,390
And I'm afraid to look around my room because what if something moves?

13
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,310
And then it's haunted but it's not haunted by me.

14
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,310
I don't like people, I don't like ghosts.

15
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,430
I wanna be by myself.

16
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,570
That's the song.

17
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,650
Oh wait, hold on.

18
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,770
Let me know how this sounds you guys.

19
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,650
It might sound fine, hold on.

20
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:03,790
This is what I was trying to fix earlier.

21
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,450
Do you hear this?

22
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,400
It might sound fine, if it's too much reverb I'll adjust it.

23
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,080
But you are a ghost.

24
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,200
Oh yeah, that's why I said haunted by someone else other than me!

25
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,820
Yeah, no?

26
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:37,500
Guys...

27
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,280
What's a freaky song to sing?

28
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,460
What's a freaky song?

29
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,320
I only did the impromptu karaoke because I was like...

30
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,420
Oh, the game is not very long.

31
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,580
I didn't know it would be so short, so I added this too.

32
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,060
Monster Mash.

33
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,440
It's not Halloween.

34
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,160
So excited for Phantom Thief, I will cheer my heart out.

35
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,720
Yeah!

36
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,620
I

37
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:14,930
just got my chicken and dill pickle white sauce calzone.

38
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,610
Pickle?

39
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,470
Sing some weird Al.

40
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,780
Solem, happy birthday!

41
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,940
Happy birthday!

42
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,620
Happy birthday to you!

43
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,940
Happy birthday to you!

44
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,880
Happy birthday dear Solem!

45
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,980
Happy birthday to you!

46
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,900
Happy birthday!

47
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,820
And last birthday Al, thank you for the birthday gift and thank you!

48
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:08,100
Weird Al has two, it shows me two Christmas songs.

49
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,800
The Night Santa Went Crazy, I don't know what that one is about.

50
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,180
But also Christmas at Ground Zero.

51
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,900
I don't know what that's also a parody of.

52
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,340
eBay, do I know that one?

53
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,380
Both classics.

54
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,040
Ground Zero, Metal Gear, Solid Snake.

55
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,420
Solid Snake welcome to membership.

56
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,580
Christmas at Ground Zero, but I don't know what it's parodying.

57
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,340
Do Friday, oh my gosh because it's Friday the 13th.

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,400
Here we go.

59
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,140
7am, waking up in the morning.

60
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,200
Gotta be fresh, gotta go downstairs.

61
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,180
Gotta have my bowl, gotta have my cereal.

62
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
Seeing everything, the time is going.

63
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,020
Ticking on and on, everybody's rushing.

64
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,460
Gotta get down to the bus stop.

65
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,980
Gotta catch my bus.

66
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,180
I see my friends, kicking in the front seat.

67
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,380
Sitting in the back seat.

68
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,380
Gotta make up my mind of which seat can I take.

69
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,880
It's Friday, Friday.

70
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,540
Gotta get down on Friday.

71
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Everybody's looking forward to the weekend, weekend.

72
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,220
Friday,

73
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,600
looking forward to the week.

74
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,620
7.45, we're driving on the highway cruising so fast.

75
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,030
These are not the lyrics.

76
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,710
She has to tell herself to think about fun.

77
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,910
Sitting in the back seat.

78
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,090
Gotta make

79
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,250
up my mind of which seat can I take.

80
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:18,410
Today, it is Friday.

81
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,710
We, we, we, so excited.

82
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,890
We so excited.

83
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,350
Tomorrow is Saturday.

84
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,810
And Sunday comes afterwards.

85
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,940
It's like, this song is the original AI written lyric song, I believe.

86
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,740
It's Friday, Friday.

87
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,120
Gotta get down on Friday.

88
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,700
Everybody's looking forward to

89
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,740
the...

90
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,940
Party and party and yeah!

91
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,160
Party and party and yeah!

92
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,220
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

93
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,540
Friday, Friday.

94
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,460
Rebecca Black is still a musician.

95
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,800
She makes actually decent songs from what I've heard.

96
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,560
Not your best work to be honest.

97
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm so sorry.

98
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm sorry.

99
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,140
There's a bunch of us watching you off a phone in the park.

100
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,400
In the park, on the highway right now.

101
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,880
Okay, people in the park.

102
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,540
What, what, what would be a good song to sing?

103
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,980
No, I can't sing that song.

104
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,780
Oh, I was gonna sing a song.

105
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,500
What would be a good song to sing?

106
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,160
I was gonna sing a song, but it's actually part of the setlist.

107
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,500
A freaky song, but it's actually part of the setlist tomorrow.

108
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,500
That's why it's in my head right now.

109
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
The weirdest part about these lyrics is...

110
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,140
You expect the weekend, but after everyone is looking forward to it so much.

111
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,560
Do you think you can sing Baby Shark?

112
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:24,520
Baby Shark do do do do do do do Baby Shark do do do do do do do Baby Shark do do do do do do do Baby Shark Wow, look at all these grown people in the park.

113
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,560
And they're watching Cocomelon.

114
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,980
These grown ass men watching Cocomelon in the park.

115
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,940
Like freaks, why are they doing that?

116
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,740
Why don't they watch the news or something?

117
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,560
Oh, Cocomelon baby adults over here.

118
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,640
Everybody stay away from these freaks.

119
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,220
Everybody.

120
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,760
They're watching Cocomelon past the age of one.

121
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,940
Why are you shaving me though?

122
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,020
I wonder if there's any Cocomelon songs on here.

123
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,840
Do they have any of their own zero results?

124
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,700
Wait, Baby Shark.

125
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,540
Christmas Baby Shark?

126
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,740
Hold on.

127
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,200
Christmas Baby Shark?

128
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,700
Sing Lazy Town?

129
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
That's a good idea.

130
00:13:23,660 --> 00:14:10,180

Is that a dog clothes?

132
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,180
Is that a dog clothes?

133
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,780
It's for you.

134
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,620
It's for you.

135
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,160
And...

136
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,660
It's for you.

137
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,460
Happy...

138
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,400
Merry...

139
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,040
Holidays...

140
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,800
Happy Holidays!

141
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,300
Grandpa Shark, are you ok?

142
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,560
Grandpa Shark.

143
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,260
Grandpa Shark is not gonna make it you guys.

144
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,680
Oh no, no, no, no more baby shark.

145
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,020
It's ok.

146
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,620
Guys, Grandpa Shark is on his last breath.

147
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,940
Oh, Grandpa Shark is... Grandpa Shark is seeing the light.

148
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,940
Grandpa Shark can only breathe out.

149
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,060
He doesn't breathe in.

150
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,430
Oh, what was it?

151
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,070
LazyTown.

152
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,180
I hope my request didn't end your stream.

153
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,680
Grandpa Shark is kinda doing it for me.

154
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,380
Ok, wait.

155
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,420
I love this song.

156
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,960
This is audio by the way.

157
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,080
I forgot to ask.

158
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,770
Now listen closely.

159
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,850
Here's a little lesson in trickery.

160
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,670
This is going down in history.

161
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:12,010
If you wanna be a villain number one, you have to chase a superhero on the run.

162
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,790
Just follow my moves and sneak around.

163
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,630
Be careful not to make a sound.

164
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,670
Shh, no, don't touch that.

165
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,460
Now look at this net that I just found.

166
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,500
When I say go, be ready to throw.

167
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,240
Go!

168
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,260
Throw on him, not me.

169
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,600
Let's try something else.

170
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,900
Now watch and learn.

171
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,360
Here's the deal.

172
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,320
Slip and slide on this banana peel.

173
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,300
What are you doing?

174
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,380
I forgot to do the...

175
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,640
I forgot to update the setlist.

176
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,460
You guys, is this the most...

177
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,700
Baby shark, Christmas.

178
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,640
This might be the most...

179
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,040
amazing setlist I've ever done.

180
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:24,330
This will be sure to bring in all the folks.

181
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,590
Can you do a song by the Wiggles?

182
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,010
Yeah.

183
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,980
I don't know a Skibbity.

184
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,260
There's a Skibbity song?

185
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,080
Fruit salad.

186
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,140
Yummy, yummy.

187
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,120
Fruit salad.

188
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,160
Yummy, yummy.

189
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,120
Fruit salad.

190
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,220
Yummy, yummy.

191
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,700
Yummy, yummy.

192
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,640
Yummy, yummy.

193
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,880
Fruit salad.

194
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,920
Let's make some fruit salad today.

195
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,000
Start to do it the healthy way.

196
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,220
Take all the fruit that you want to eat.

197
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,000
It's going to be a fruit salad treat.

198
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,180
The first step.

199
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,000
Peel your bananas.

200
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,180
The second step.

201
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,340
Toss in some grapes.

202
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,200
The third step.

203
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,360
Chop up some apples.

204
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,000
Chop up some melons and put them on your plate.

205
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,160
Now you've made it, it's time to eat.

206
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:35,400
It tastes so good that you just can't beat it.

207
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,220
Give everyone a plate and a spoon.

208
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,240
We'll all be eating it very soon.

209
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,300
The first step.

210
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,200
Eat up the banana.

211
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,320
The second step.

212
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,460
Eat up some grapes.

213
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,320
The third step.

214
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,360
Eat up some apples.

215
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,580
Eat the melons, now there's nothing on your plate.

216
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,260
Now we've had our fruit salad today.

217
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,320
It's time to put the scraps away.

218
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,300
Wash the bowls and wash the spoon.

219
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,280
Let's do it all again real soon.

220
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,900
Why is this song so long?

221
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,760
Yummy, yummy.

222
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,480
Fruit salad.

223
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,560
Yummy, yummy.

224
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,480
Fruit salad.

225
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,520
Yummy, yummy.

226
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,940
Yummy, yummy, yummy, yummy.

227
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,220
Fruit salad.

228
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,480
Fruit salad.

229
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,040
Together!

230
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,580
Yummy, yummy.

231
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Fruit salad.

232
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,540
Yummy, yummy.

233
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,540
Fruit salad.

234
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,560
Yummy, yummy.

235
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,620
Fruit salad.

236
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,320
That was fruit salad.

237
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,160
I also...

238
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,040
I saw your super chat.

239
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't know VeggieTales songs.

240
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,060
Fruit salad.

241
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,220
Yummy, yummy.

242
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:21,740
Good.

243
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Well, you know.

244
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,180
Next therapy session is gonna be interesting.

245
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,560
Big red car.

246
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,440
I don't think I know that one.

247
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,640
Had my birthday in November, but did not attend to watch the stream before now.

248
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,760
Can I still have a birthday song?

249
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:45,420
Ffff....

250
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,580
Ffff...

251
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:04,940
OK.

252
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,520
Happy birthday to you.

253
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,040
Happy birthday to you.

254
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,880
Happy birthday.

255
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,740
Gray is not there.

256
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,560
Happy birthday.

257
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,420
Very light birthday.

258
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,020
To you.

259
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,860
Good evening.

260
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,820
Keep being awesome.

261
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,720
Thank you.

262
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,260
Oh, so PandraDrag...

263
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,780
Thank you for the 50 gifted!

264
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,300
Whole request, do no clint ad songs.

265
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,860
I don't know if I was gonna do it.

266
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,320
I could do JP today.

267
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,380
Maybe.

268
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,660
If I can find them.

269
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,620
Put that on the set list.

270
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,260
What's a freaky song?

271
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,780
What's a freaky song?

272
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,680
Atabama necromancy.

273
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,400
I sang that for Halloween.

274
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,280
Let's see.

275
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,440
Wait, hold on.

276
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,040
I know one.

277
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:37,440
Let's see.

278
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,200
This is a kind of freaky song.

279
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,800
What's the duck song?

280
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,560
I don't know that one.

281
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,480
Creep by Radiohead except it's freaky.

282
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,060
Don't you disrespect me little man.

283
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,940
Don't you derogate or deride.

284
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:01,040
You're in my world now, not your world.

285
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,560
And I've got friends on the other side.

286
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,540
He's got friends on the other side.

287
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,900
That's an echo, gentlemen.

288
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,880
Just a little thing we have here in Louisiana.

289
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,680
A little parlor trick, don't worry.

290
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,320
Sit down at my table.

291
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,640
Put your minds at ease.

292
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:26,000
If you relax, it will enable me to do anything I please.

293
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,660
I can read your future.

294
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,780
I can change it around some too.

295
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,560
I'll look deep into your heart and soul.

296
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,320
You do have a soul, don't you, Wisp?

297
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,080
Make your wildest dreams come true.

298
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,420
I've got voodoo, I've got voodoo.

299
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,320
I've got things I ain't even tried.

300
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:48,380
And I've got friends on the other side.

301
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,380
I've got human friends on the other side.

302
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,360
The cards, the cards, the cards will tell.

303
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,060
The past, the present, and the future as well.

304
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,340
The cards, the cards.

305
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,740
Just take three.

306
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,200
Take a little trip into your future with me.

307
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,300
Now you, young man, are from across the sea.

308
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,400
You come from two long lines of royalty.

309
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,020
I'm a royal myself on my mother's side.

310
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,280
Your lifestyle's high, but your funds are low.

311
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,380
You need to marry little honey because daddy got low.

312
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,200
Mom and dad cut you off, huh, playboy?

313
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,780
You guys wish, right?

314
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,880
You just want to be free, hop from place to place.

315
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,780
But freedom takes green.

316
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:53,860
It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need.

317
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,860
And when I look into your future, it's the green that I see.

318
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,940
You, little man, I won't waste much time.

319
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:04,600
You've been pushed around all your life.

320
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,740
You've been pushed around by your mother and your sister and your brother.

321
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,500
And if you was married, you'd be pushed around by your wife.

322
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:23,740
But in your future, the you I see is exactly the man you always wanted to be.

323
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,540
Shake my hand.

324
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,380
Got my wisps?

325
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:33,540
Won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?

326
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,980
Yes!

327
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,480
Are you ready?

328
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,900
Are you ready?

329
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,080
Transformation Central!

330
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,000
Reformation Central!

331
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,480
Transformation Central!

332
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,340
Can you feel my gratification?

333
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,820
You're changing, you're changing, all right.

334
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,980
I hope you're satisfied.

335
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,440
But if you win, don't blame me.

336
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:11,840
You can blame my friends on the other side.

337
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,780
My favorite Disney song by my favorite YouTuber.

338
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,100
Let's go!

339
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,980
Thanks for the pink!

340
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,500
That was...also who the hell said...

341
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,420
Thank goodness I missed the songs that I hate.

342
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,160
How do you hate fruit salad?

343
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,620
And we are number one!

344
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,160
We are number one, it's the absolute most goated song ever.

345
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,020
What was that?

346
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,780
Oh, friends on the other side.

347
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,980
It's the green, it's the green.

348
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,500
What?

349
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,340
Is my mic OK?

350
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,340
I hear it going...I hear it like peaking.

351
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,790
I'll turn it down.

352
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,290
Maybe I'll just hold my mic instead.

353
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,470
Like I'm holding an actual mic.

354
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,790
I'm holding my mic now.

355
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,150
Well, these guys are holding it, but you know.

356
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:15,970
That was really close to me.

357
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,870
Love Mito's evil laugh.

358
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,610
Love Mito's evil laugh.

359
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,210
See, like right there.

360
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,850
My mic is OK.

361
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,410
Anyway, thanks for the gift ad.

362
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,230
Do you know PPAP?

363
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,210
I have a pen.

364
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,090
I have an apple.

365
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,350
Apple pen.

366
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,770
I have a pen.

367
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,210
I have pineapple.

368
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,950
Pineapple pen.

369
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,430
Apple pen.

370
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,310
Pineapple pen.

371
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,940
Don't worry, we'll sing some serious songs too.

372
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,920
Well, I say serious, but like...

373
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,900
Time Warp!

374
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,160
That's a good freaky song.

375
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,040
Time Warp.

376
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,740
It says duet.

377
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,180
Which is the right one?

378
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,540
There are so many versions.

379
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,480
I'll try.

380
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,040
Wait, let's see this one.

381
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,220
I'm in the US right now.

382
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,300
We'll be playing a car game tomorrow.

383
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,780
Oh my gosh, Mito!

384
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,560
Good luck!

385
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,340
Good luck, good luck!

386
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,730
OK, I'm the pen.

387
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,690
Wait, do I have to do both parts?

388
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,870
It's astounding.

389
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,630
Time is fleeting.

390
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,310
Madness takes its toll.

391
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,870
But listen closely.

392
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,330
Not very much longer.

393
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,310
I've got to keep control.

394
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,090
I remember

395
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,040
drinking.

396
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:32,490
Though the blackness would hit me.

397
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,810
And a voice would be calling.

398
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:39,210
Let's do the Time Warp.

399
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,100
Let's do the Time Warp again.

400
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,200
It's just a jump to the left.

401
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,580
And then a step to the right.

402
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,240
With your hands on your hips.

403
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:58,420
You bring your knees in tightness.

404
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,610
That really drives you insane.

405
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,170
Let's do the Time Warp again.

406
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:13,550
Let's do the Time Warp again.

407
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,910
It's so dreamy.

408
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,810
Oh, fantasy, free me.

409
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,590
So you can't see me.

410
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,190
No, not at all.

411
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,450
In another dimension.

412
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,370
With voyeuristic intention.

413
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:32,930
Well secluded.

414
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,010
I see all.

415
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,030
With a bit of a mind flip.

416
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,970
And with a time flip.

417
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,730
And nothing can ever be the same.

418
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,870
You're spaced out on sensation.

419
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,050
Like you're under sedation.

420
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:57,190
Let's do the Time Warp.

421
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:11,990
Wait, you shook me up.

422
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,430
He took me by surprise.

423
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,150
He had a pick.

424
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,120
I felt a change.

425
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,840
Time

426
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:31,780
then.

427
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,700
It's just a jump to the left.

428
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,930
With your hands on your hips.

429
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,930
You bring your knees in tight.

430
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,870
But it's the pelvic.

431
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,220
Let's do the Time Warp.

432
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,280
Let's do the Time Warp again.

433
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,590
Freaky.

434
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:08,570
Time.

435
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,590
Time.

436
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:10,970
Warp.

437
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,810
I saw someone request this earlier.

438
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,550
Like I said, they don't have to be all freaky songs.

439
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,170
Freaky.

440
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,750
This one, right?

441
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:40,820
Whenever I see someone less fortunate than I.

442
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,080
Let's face it, who is it?

443
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,300
Less fortunate than I.

444
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,620
My tender heart tends to start to bleed.

445
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,260
And when someone needs a makeover, I simply have to take over.

446
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,520
I know, I know.

447
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,000
Exactly what they need.

448
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,200
And even in your case.

449
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,320
Though it's the toughest case I've yet to face.

450
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,960
Don't worry.

451
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,160
I'm determined to succeed.

452
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,720
Follow my lead.

453
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,440
And yes, indeed.

454
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:25,600
You will be popular.

455
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,720
You're gonna be popular.

456
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,440
I'll teach you the proper poise when you talk to boys.

457
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,440
Little ways to flirt and flounce.

458
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,580
I'll show you what shoes to wear.

459
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,140
How to fix your hair.

460
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,800
Everything that really counts to be popular.

461
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,880
I'll help you be popular.

462
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
You'll hang with the right cohorts.

463
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,900
You'll be good at sports.

464
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,180
Know the slang you've got to know.

465
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,500
So let's start.

466
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,840
Cause you've got a long way to go.

467
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
Don't be offended by my frank analysis.

468
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,640
Think of it as personality dialysis.

469
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,560
Now that I've chosen to become a pal, a sister, an advisor.

470
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,080
There's nobody wiser.

471
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,320
Not when it comes to popular.

472
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,480
I know about popular.

473
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,980
And with an assist from me.

474
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,460
To be who you'll be.

475
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,520
Instead of dreary who you were.

476
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,620
There's nothing that can stop you from becoming popular.

477
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:34,220
We're gonna make you popular.

478
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,280
When I see depressing creatures.

479
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,920
With unprepossessing features.

480
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,260
I remind them on their own behalf.

481
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:50,000
To think of celebrated heads of state.

482
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,260
Or specially great communicators.

483
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,680
Did they have brains or knowledge?

484
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,340
Don't make me laugh.

485
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,160
They were popular.

486
00:35:59,580 --> 00:35:59,960
Please.

487
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,980
It's all about popular.

488
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,680
It's not about aptitude.

489
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
It's the way you're viewed.

490
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,540
So it's very shrewd to be.

491
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,390
Very, very popular.

492
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,360
Like me.

493
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
Oh my gosh.

494
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:17,660
Wisps.

495
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,180
Look at you.

496
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,100
You're beautiful.

497
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
I have to go.

498
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,940
Wow, that sounds sexy.

499
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,420
And though you protest.

500
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,720
Your disinterest.

501
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,960
I know clandestinely.

502
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,660
You're kinda gonna embarrass me from popularity.

503
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,160
You'll be popular.

504
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,060
Just not quite as popular.

505
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
As me.

506
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,600
They're watching you in a waffle house?

507
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,660
Wait, actually...

508
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,820
Don't do that.

509
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,360
You're supposed to fight at the waffle house.

510
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,540
Popular.

511
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,380
I know I'm all popular.

512
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,720
What's up fighting music?

513
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,660
Don't say break stuff.

514
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,420
I have to save my throat.

515
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,680
Hope you have fun at the concert too.

516
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,860
Thank you Panther.

517
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,440
Burno, welcome to membership.

518
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,440
Thank you.

519
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,400
Dark of the night from Anastasia.

520
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,200
I don't know what I'm saying.

521
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,900
Wait, I know one song from Anastasia.

522
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,500
Actually I know a couple songs from Anastasia.

523
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,060
I am the tiger.

524
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,460
Oh that's a great one.

525
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,430
Fight!

526
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:12,790
Fight!

527
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,230
Fight!

528
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,670
Fight!

529
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,070
Fight!

530
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:14,470
Fight!

531
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:14,870
Fight!

532
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,270
Fight!

533
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,430
Fight!

534
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,390
Fight!

535
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:16,650
Fight!

536
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:16,850
Fight!

537
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,570
Bloody.

538
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,600
Time took my chances.

539
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,660
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet.

540
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,120
Just a man and his will to survive.

541
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:26,940
So many times it happened too fast.

542
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,300
You change your passion for glory.

543
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,500
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past.

544
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,920
You must fight just to keep them alive.

545
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,100
It's the eye of the tiger.

546
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,880
It's the thrill of the fight.

547
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,920
Rising up to the challenge of our rival.

548
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,700
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night.

549
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:59,020
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.

550
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,520
Face to face, out in the heat.

551
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,000
Hanging tough, staying hungry.

552
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,600
Except you're at Waffle House, you should be eating.

553
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,060
We stack the odds till we take to the street.

554
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,280
For the kill with the skill to survive.

555
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,760
It's the eye of the tiger.

556
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,560
It's the thrill of the fight.

557
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,580
Rising up to the challenge of our rival.

558
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,360
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night.

559
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,900
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger.

560
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,530
Rising up, straight to the top.

561
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:54,270
Had the guts, got the glory.

562
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,130
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop.

563
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,850
Just a ghost, and with no will to survive.

564
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:05,810
It's the eye of the tiger.

565
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,010
It's the thrill of the tiger.

566
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,630
Rising up to the challenge of the tiger.

567
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,390
And the last known tiger stalks his prey in the night.

568
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,850
And he's watching us all with the eye...

569
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,930
...of the tiger.

570
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,990
Neil C.C.

571
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:28,370
Ergo.

572
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,030
The

573
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:39,050
eye of the tiger.

574
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,670
The eye of the tiger.

575
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,600
The house of the tiger.

576
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:04,290
The house of the tiger.

577
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,520
Someone requested another song.

578
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:40,660
I think this one will be embarrassing if you're listening in public.

579
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,900
I might try the filter with this one.

580
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,140
I don't know if it's too much or not.

581
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,740
Baby, can't you see I'm calling?

582
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,360
A guy like you should wear a warning.

583
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,400
It's dangerous, I'm falling.

584
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:20,620
There's no escape, I can't wait.

585
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,710
I need a hit, baby give me it.

586
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,720
You're dangerous, I'm loving it.

587
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,840
Too high, can't come down.

588
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,220
Listen, my head's spinning round and round.

589
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,500
Do you feel me now?

590
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,820
With the taste of your lips, I wanna run.

591
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,640
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

592
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:56,600
A taste of a poison paradise.

593
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,300
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

594
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,000
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

595
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,840
It's getting late to give you up.

596
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:21,260
I took a sip from the devil's cup.

597
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,820
Slowly, it's taking over me.

598
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,820
Too high, can't come down.

599
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,540
It's in the air and it's all around.

600
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,430
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

601
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,290
A taste of a poison paradise.

602
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,430
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

603
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:04,350
And I love what you do, don't you know that you're toxic?

604
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,860
Don't you know that you're toxic?

605
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,700
Taste of your lips, I'm on a run.

606
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,320
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

607
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,920
A taste of a poison paradise.

608
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,020
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

609
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:44,680
Taste of your lips, I'm on a run.

610
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,800
You're toxic, I'm slipping under.

611
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,360
A taste of a poison paradise.

612
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,480
I'm addicted to you, don't you know that you're toxic?

613
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,200
You're toxic in me now, but you're loving now.

614
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,740
I think I'm ready now.

615
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,920
You're toxic in me now, but you're loving now.

616
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,720
I think I'm ready now.

617
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,400
That was toxic.

618
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:20,200
Toxic.

619
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:28,190
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

620
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:29,710
Too eroic.

621
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:37,500
I had to do something that would make everybody embarrassed if they're listening in public.

622
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,400
Too bad there's no erotic songs on here.

623
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,820
I've already checked before.

624
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:51,940
Actually, I don't know.

625
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,380
Did I search like this?

626
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,200
No, there is none.

627
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,380
Dang.

628
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,700
You proved that you can be ero.

629
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:06,600
Stop!

630
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:12,020
Boneless incoming.

631
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,420
Erotic songs are bangers too.

632
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,480
I know, right?

633
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:19,980
Do you guys know?

634
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,300
Apatou is pretty ero.

635
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:22,880
Is it actually?

636
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,080
Apatou, apatou, apatou, apatou.

637
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,220
I don't know it very well though.

638
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,100
That's the one with Bruno Mars and Lisa, right?

639
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,020
Oh, Rose.

640
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:46,900
Sorry.

641
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,920
Rose sings it.

642
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,720
I don't see it.

643
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,060
I see.

644
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,200
I told you, I don't know it.

645
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,700
I told you, I don't know it.

646
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:58,100
I don't know it.

647
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,640
Apatou, apatou, apatou, apatou, apatou.

648
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:08,800
Apatou, apatou, apatou, apatou, apatou.

649
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,300
Anything by Sabrina Carpenter.

650
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,260
True!

651
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,820
Sabrina Carpenter.

652
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,840
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

653
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,660
Thank you.

654
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,380
I don't know Juno, but I want to learn that one soon.

655
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,220
Can I request Neil Cicierega Lemon Demon?

656
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,480
Honestly, I don't know so many other Neil Cicierega ones.

657
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,920
Besides Boston.

658
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,140
I think I've done this one before though.

659
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,900
I'll sing this Sabrina Carpenter.

660
00:48:56,180 --> 00:48:57,140
I think.

661
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,210
It's not me, I'm an I.O.

662
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:14,250
Is that sweet?

663
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:15,430
I guess so.

664
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:17,910
She can't sleep, baby, I know.

665
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,410
That's not me, espresso.

666
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,490
Move it up, down, left, right, oh.

667
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,290
Switch it up like Nintendo.

668
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,090
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

669
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,730
That's not me, espresso.

670
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,450
I can't relate to desperation.

671
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,010
My give-up bugs are on vacation.

672
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:42,790
And I got this one boy, and he won't stop calling.

673
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,470
When they act this way, I know I got him.

674
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,830
Too bad your ex didn't do it for ya.

675
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,110
Walked in a dream, came true before ya.

676
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:54,490
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya.

677
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,030
I know a mountain do it for ya.

678
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,330
That morning coffee brewed it for ya.

679
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,670
One touch and I brand new it for ya.

680
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,590
Now he's...

681
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:08,650
Think about me every night, oh.

682
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:09,690
Isn't that sweet?

683
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:10,790
I guess so.

684
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:13,270
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

685
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:14,770
That's not me, espresso.

686
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,890
Move it up, down, left, right, oh.

687
00:50:18,010 --> 00:50:19,510
Switch it up like Nintendo.

688
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:22,470
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

689
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,090
That's not me, espresso.

690
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:26,050
Holy shit.

691
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:28,010
Why'd she say that?

692
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,270
I guess so.

693
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:31,550
I'm working late.

694
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:33,270
Cause I'm a streamer.

695
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:36,190
Oh, he looks so cute.

696
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,150
Wrapped around my finger.

697
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:40,370
My twisted humor.

698
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:42,810
Make him laugh so often.

699
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:45,170
My honeybee.

700
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,290
Come and get this fallen.

701
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,830
Too bad your ex don't do it for ya.

702
00:50:49,970 --> 00:50:52,090
Walked in a dream, came true before ya.

703
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,470
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya.

704
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,030
I know a mountain do it for ya.

705
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,330
That morning coffee brewed it for ya.

706
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,790
One touch and I brand new it for ya.

707
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:06,470
Now he's...

708
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,210
thinking about me every night.

709
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:09,690
Oh, isn't that sweet?

710
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:10,790
I guess so.

711
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,290
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

712
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,810
That's not me, espresso.

713
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,810
Move it up, down, left, right, oh.

714
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:19,510
Switch it up like Nintendo.

715
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,470
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

716
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,190
That's not me, espresso.

717
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:26,710
Thinking about me every night.

718
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,150
Oh, isn't that sweet?

719
00:51:28,230 --> 00:51:29,270
I guess so.

720
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:31,730
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

721
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:33,350
That's not me, espresso.

722
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,290
Move it up, down, left, right, oh.

723
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:37,990
Switch it up like Nintendo.

724
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:40,970
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know.

725
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:42,590
That's not me, espresso.

726
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:45,070
I'm now...

727
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:45,910
maybe...

728
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:48,350
obsessed with me...

729
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:48,490
right?

730
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:53,630
Maybe...

731
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:54,990
you're obsessed with me?

732
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,180
I'm working late.

733
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,640
Because I'm a streamer.

734
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:12,860
Espresso.

735
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,540
Sing Mirage by Kiowa.

736
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,580
So desu.

737
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:37,800
Is there a Mirage karaoke?

738
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,440
I wonder.

739
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,060
I can try.

740
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:42,100
Oh gosh.

741
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,740
I hope she's asleep.

742
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:46,280
Mirage.

743
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,060
Mirage.

744
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,200
Kiowa.

745
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:52,340
Instrumental.

746
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,500
Is there one?

747
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:55,420
Oh my gosh, wait.

748
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:56,100
Okay, lyrics.

749
00:52:59,180 --> 00:52:59,980
Mirage, oh wait.

750
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:01,940
Kiowa.

751
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:04,660
Kiowa.

752
00:53:11,870 --> 00:53:13,650
Oh gosh, I feel like I'm gonna mess this up.

753
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,410
I'm sorry, Kiowa.

754
00:53:43,780 --> 00:54:02,500
Make me up a new persona Calculated perfectly for you Pretending like it's all just for me But I think so, live life incognito Oh, I play God and I'm asking why You'll never see what I want, what I need Oh, do you?

755
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,400
No, no.

756
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,260
Oh, do you?

757
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:13,120
Follow through, let you pursue But now...

758
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:30,660
Tell me I'm a Mirage I told you up and... I told you up and down Wait, what to do with this mess Tell me the cost, it'd be good Play a part, my Mirage Mirage Oh no, wait.

759
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:32,120
I don't remember this part.

760
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,320
Everybody listen to the original, because it's better.

761
00:54:56,560 --> 00:55:00,600
You'll never see what I want, what I need Oh, do you?

762
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:01,660
No, no.

763
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,400
Oh, do you?

764
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:11,320
Follow through, let you pursue But now...

765
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:25,100
Tell me I'm a Mirage I told you up and... I told you up and down Wait, what to do with this mess Tell me the cost, it'd be good Play a part, my Mirage Mirage

766
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:54,320
Let me feel you Sorry, I get so nervous when I sing these songs.

767
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,000
Tell me I'm a Mirage I told you up and...

768
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:19,860
I don't even know what to do with this mess Tell me the cost, it'd be good Play a part, my Mirage Mirage Mirage Spin the lights, the skies align On and on and on and on This Mirage, I'm lost Mirage Mirage

769
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:44,260
Yay, that was Mirage.

770
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:45,200
Kind of.

771
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,120
That was Mirage, kind of.

772
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,380
Kind of.

773
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,360
It's so different, like, listening to a song.

774
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,280
But, like, I never, I don't know, I only do the...

775
00:56:57,700 --> 00:56:59,380
I only do the...

776
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,740
I never, like, sing along with it, I don't know.

777
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,740
I just listen to it.

778
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,180
Sounds like a hard song to sing live.

779
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,700
Yeah, there's a lot of overlapping parts, so...

780
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:20,980
I have to play Hot To Go.

781
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:24,760
Ok.

782
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:38,680
Why do you guys want me to sing Itch and the Borderline so much?

783
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,640
You guys aren't sick of that song?

784
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,780
5, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8

785
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:17,000
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city Who can play my girl?

786
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,480
Call me hot, not pretty Baby, do you like this beat?

787
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:44,120
I made it so you dance with me It's like 199 degrees When you're doing it with me, doing it with me H-O-T-T-O-G-O Snap and clap and touch your toes Raise your hands now, body roll Dance it out, you're hot to go H-O-T-T-O-G-O Snap and clap and touch your toes Raise your hands now,

788
00:58:44,200 --> 00:59:14,340
body roll H-O-T-T-O-G-O H-O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me hot to go H-O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me hot to go When I woke up alone, staring at my ceiling I try not to care, but it hurts my feelings You don't have to stare, come here, get with it No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute Baby,

789
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,560
don't you like this beat?

790
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:38,900
I made it so you'd sleep with me It's like 199 degrees When you're doing it with me, doing it with me H-O-T-T-O-G-O Snap and clap and touch your toes Raise your hands now, body roll Dance it out, you're hot to go H-O-T-T-O-G-O Snap and clap and touch your toes Raise your hands now,

791
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:57,020
body roll H-O-T-T-O-G-O H-O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me hot to go H-O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me hot to go What's it take to get your heart down, babe?

792
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,640
What's it take to bring you home?

793
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,220
Hurry up, it's time for supper

794
01:00:22,570 --> 01:00:39,200
H -O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me hot to go H-O-T-T-O-G-O You can take me hot to go It's hot in here.

795
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,140
Is anyone else hot?

796
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:56,150
Yay!

797
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:57,510
Yay!

798
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:11,890
H-O-T-T-O-G-O Fine, I don't know that one H-O-T-T-O-G-O

799
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:17,550
Someone earlier requested...

800
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:24,830
I don't know, I feel like I'm being really silly tonight Doing serious songs seems...

801
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:30,710
It feels weird to do serious songs, I'm being too silly tonight It's because I did that song and it stuck in my head all the time?

802
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,390
I'm sorry I'm sorry

803
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:40,630
It's a silly night Fighting Dreamers!

804
01:01:40,690 --> 01:01:43,050
We are Fighting Dreamers!

805
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,550
Fighting Dreamers!

806
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:50,330
Fighting Dreamers!

807
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,650
Just go mad right now!

808
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,250
Right now!

809
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:10,950
We get it until you are sexy, you don't have to keep proving us wrong No, I don't think you believe that My beloved monster eels.

810
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,950
I don't know that one, I'm so sorry!

811
01:02:14,870 --> 01:02:18,070
I'm so sorry Did you say you knew one Anastasia song?

812
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:22,210
Yeah, that's what I was about to do But that's why I was just like, it feels weird to...

813
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:30,870
Anastasia Sing a serious song, you know I know a couple Anastasia songs

814
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:47,360
I like this song though, I'll do this one It's a little serious This is fine though Just fine

815
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:31,480
Heart, don't fail me now Courage, don't desert me Don't turn back now that we're here People always say Life is full of choices No one ever mentions fear Or how the world can seem so vast On a journey To the past

816
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:58,520
Somewhere down this road I know someone's waiting Years of dreams just can't be wrong Arms will open wide I'll be safe and want it finally, home where I belong.

817
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:12,880
Well, starting now, I'm learning fast on this journey to the past.

818
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:30,420
Family, there was once a time I must have had them too.

819
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:40,980
A family, I will never be complete until I find you.

820
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:54,480
One step at a time, one hope then another, who knows where this road may go.

821
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:04,440
Back to who I was, on to find my future, things my heart still needs to know.

822
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,380
Yes, let this be a sign, let this road be mine.

823
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:19,260
Let it lead me to my past, and bring me home.

824
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,380
Sorry, I couldn't...

825
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,580
That was from Anastasia.

826
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:44,100
Journey to the past.

827
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,720
You're a sinner.

828
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,840
Do you know what emergence vibe from IMAS?

829
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:50,140
I don't think I do.

830
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:52,960
Last surprise from P5.

831
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:53,960
I've never played P5.

832
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,660
I'm sorry, I always feel bad when you guys super chat songs.

833
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,760
I don't know them.

834
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:02,400
All that jazz.

835
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:05,020
And all that jazz.

836
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:12,960
And all that jazz.

837
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,160
What was that?

838
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:17,940
Journey to the past.

839
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:23,680
Wait, journey to the past.

840
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,100
Past.

841
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:29,630
Look at the membership!

842
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:31,210
Thank you.

843
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:34,730
Thank you.

844
01:06:37,010 --> 01:06:39,890
Fine, I'll do this since so many people are like, please.

845
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:45,880
Before I forget.

846
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:54,700
Oh, this one.

847
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,680
I don't know this one.

848
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:05,850
I don't know this one.

849
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:35,850
I don't know this one.

850
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:38,210
I

851
01:08:49,180 --> 01:09:11,920
don't know this one.

852
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:32,600
I don't know this one.

853
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:36,010
I don't know

854
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:48,580
this one.

855
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:07,780
I

856
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:32,310
don't know what happened.

857
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:36,610
For some reason, I couldn't hear myself singing this song.

858
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:39,230
Like my... I don't know.

859
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:40,830
What's it called?

860
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:41,490
It got all weird.

861
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,210
My monitor.

862
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:44,610
So if I sounded bad, I'm really sorry.

863
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:46,510
Couldn't hear myself.

864
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,970
Consider Ikenai Butterline and Snake Eater your signature songs.

865
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,650
I don't think I'm the only one.

866
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:55,350
No way, really?

867
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:02,450
Ikenai Butterline.

868
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:07,950
I'm gonna give a... If you're listening from the convention.

869
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:10,890
Rather, if you're going to the concert.

870
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:15,510
I'm giving a little hint for a song that Doki and I are singing tomorrow.

871
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:18,570
There's a part in it.

872
01:12:20,010 --> 01:12:23,430
Where you guys have to yell.

873
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,410
But I don't think it's a super well-known song.

874
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:30,090
So I don't want to say what the song is.

875
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:35,610
But basically, I think you can follow along pretty easily.

876
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:40,330
Because, you know, we also recorded backing for it.

877
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:43,690
So...

878
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:47,230
I'm just... If you're listening.

879
01:12:47,470 --> 01:12:47,750
I don't know.

880
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:50,370
Maybe I should've... I talked about it too with her.

881
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:52,710
I was just like, we should probably tell people.

882
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:57,150
At least with this part, since there's like a...

883
01:12:57,150 --> 01:13:00,710
So basically, you'll just go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

884
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:01,930
It's really easy.

885
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:06,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

886
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:08,150
That's it.

887
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:09,030
So, you know.

888
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:11,810
If you're there, maybe go see it.

889
01:13:13,310 --> 01:13:14,890
But if not...

890
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:19,850
If not, then there's a karaoke right now.

891
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:20,410
Yippee!

892
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:27,230
I think you guys can follow along if you heard it.

893
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:28,030
Don't worry.

894
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,360
Can you do For Good from Wicked?

895
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:37,440
That's such a sad song, but I'll do it.

896
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:43,560
Such a sad song.

897
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,840
Why are you making me sing sad things?

898
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:45,100
Wait.

899
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,220
Okay, here we go.

900
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,530
This song makes me tear up.

901
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:53,750
Wait, whose part?

902
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:55,450
I gotta switch parts, I think.

903
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,070
Girlfriend by Avril Lavigne.

904
01:13:59,770 --> 01:14:00,850
I'll sing that one.

905
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,690
I'm limited.

906
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,370
Just look at me.

907
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:10,690
I'm limited.

908
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,370
And just look at you.

909
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:17,990
You can do all I couldn't do.

910
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:20,730
Good enough.

911
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:29,370
So now it's up to you.

912
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,450
For the both of us.

913
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,810
Now it's up to you.

914
01:14:50,140 --> 01:15:55,500
I've heard it said That people come into our lives for a reason Bringing something we must learn And we are led To those who help us most to grow If we let them Then we help them in return Well, I don't know if I believe that's true But I know I'm who I am today Because I knew you Like a comet pulled from orbit As it passes the sun Like a stream that meets a boulder Halfway through the woods Who can say if I've been changed for the better?

915
01:15:57,460 --> 01:16:12,280
Cause I knew you I have been changed for good

916
01:16:15,760 --> 01:17:17,020
And well maybe That we will never meet again In this lifetime So let me say before we part So much of me Is made of what I learned from you You'll be with me Like a handprint on my heart And now, whatever way our stories end I know you have rewritten mine By being my friend Like a ship blown from its mooring By a wind off the sea Like a seed dropped by a skybird In a distant wood Who can say if I've been changed for the better But,

917
01:17:17,700 --> 01:18:12,180
because I knew you Because I knew you I have been changed for good And just to clear the air I ask forgiveness For the things I've done you blamed me for But then I guess we know there's blame to share And none of it seems to matter anymore Like a comet pulled from mooring As it passes the sun Like a stream that meets a boulder Halfway through the wood Who can say if I've been changed for the better?

918
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,880
I do believe I have been changed for the better.

919
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,820
And because I knew you...

920
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:30,220
Because I knew you...

921
01:18:30,220 --> 01:18:35,960
Because I knew you...

922
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:45,580
I have been changed...

923
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:46,980
For...

924
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:50,660
For good.

925
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,640
I couldn't remember which harmony part it is.

926
01:19:02,260 --> 01:19:03,100
I couldn't remember.

927
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,320
Yay!

928
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:06,100
That was for good.

929
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:08,000
I'm not okay after that.

930
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,480
For good.

931
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,160
Sad song.

932
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:21,720
Sad song.

933
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,320
Crying in the club.

934
01:19:27,740 --> 01:19:29,400
Crying in the club.

935
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:33,920
You sound way better than the green one.

936
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:36,600
What do you mean by that?

937
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:41,780
I'll do a couple more.

938
01:19:42,740 --> 01:19:45,120
I should rest my throat a little bit.

939
01:19:46,060 --> 01:19:47,040
Itai my kokoro.

940
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,300
Someone requested something and I don't remember what.

941
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:55,040
God knows?

942
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:56,320
Why are there so many god knows?

943
01:19:57,480 --> 01:19:58,560
Fine, fine, fine.

944
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,880
I need the background.

945
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,300
I can do this one.

946
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,300
I think that one will get flagged.

947
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,140
This is fine, probably.

948
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,100
Ah!

949
01:21:15,030 --> 01:21:50,510
Zenaka mukete satashimau ano lonely rain Watashi wo tsuiteiku yo donna tsurai sekai no yami no naka de sae Kitto anata wo kagayaite Koeru mirai no hate yowasa yue ni tamashii kowasareru you ni Kasanaru yo ima futari ni god bless

950
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:27,220
Tokashite samayou

951
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:54,340
Semete utsukushii yume dake wo Egakinagara oikakeyou for your lonely heart Stop it!

952
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,760
Lies aren't like you.

953
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,520
Look into my eyes.

954
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:03,950
This is who I am.

955
01:23:04,410 --> 01:23:07,490
I, I, I, I, I!

956
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:13,050
In the future, when I get stronger, I might be able to change my fate.

957
01:23:14,010 --> 01:23:22,950
My wish, I want to make it come true, but everything is God knows.

958
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:32,610
You are here, you are here, but the other people have disappeared.

959
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:57,440
I will follow you, no matter how painful the darkness of the world is.

960
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:03,280
Surely, you will shine.

961
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:15,700
To the end of the future, so that my soul won't be destroyed by my weakness, my way, I will overlap now.

962
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:19,700
God bless us both.

963
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,340
Yay,

964
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:55,870
that was God knows.

965
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,270
I tried to...

966
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:23,150
I tried to do calls for songs to help you guys learn how and when to like, you know, insert call, insert, you know, and do, you know, because it's like, it can be kind of like, silly to remember, you know, I mean, even I, you know, I've been doing this for like,

967
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:42,730
10 plus years, and even I still make mistakes sometimes, you know, it's, my hope for you guys is to, and I've been thinking about this as of lately, you know, because a lot of more people I've seen, so many people getting into, into otage, and getting into...

968
01:25:42,730 --> 01:25:43,730
No, thank you for that!

969
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:52,270
Getting, getting into otage and getting into doing mix and all that fun stuff.

970
01:25:52,270 --> 01:26:10,910
And, you know, the one thing always to remember is it's not, it doesn't have to be so clean, you know, don't forget why you're doing otage, don't just do it to do it, you have to do it because it comes from your soul, you know, otage and mix, it sounds ugly,

971
01:26:11,070 --> 01:26:27,030
that's why you hear the guys being like, because it's supposed to, I always say, unleash the yakai in your soul, you know, because it's supposed to come from your actual gut, you're supposed to feel like you are so excited to support favorite idol, your favorite,

972
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:49,950
like, singer, favorite, you know, whoever, favorite, um, like, you know, I guess, I guess singer or idol really kind of, kind of, but you know what I mean, your favorite talent, so that you can't help but literally like scream, that's where, that's where the mix comes from,

973
01:26:49,950 --> 01:27:14,190
that's where it comes from, so don't ever forget that, don't ever forget why, you know, the oen dan, where the otage comes from, the otage is not just to spin your pen lights around, it's supposed to be, you know, to truly, truly, you know, support the idol,

974
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:26,590
I kind of, you know, don't want things to get lost in the sauce a little bit, maybe it's just because I'm an old school ota, maybe it's because I'm an old school ota, how am I gatekeeping?

975
01:27:26,830 --> 01:27:27,290
What the fuck?

976
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:29,750
I'm literally teaching people how to do calls.

977
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:34,170
Oh, is that a rainbow?

978
01:27:34,410 --> 01:27:35,370
Oh my gosh, thank you!

979
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:36,490
Thank you, dude!

980
01:27:36,810 --> 01:27:37,530
Thank you!

981
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:40,730
Thank you so much!

982
01:27:45,790 --> 01:28:06,750
But, you know, I went to an idol show not too long ago, and I don't know, calls and stuff have evolved, it's kind of, I've been talking to my friends recently about it, about how, like, the western sphere has kind of made their old, like, ota culture,

983
01:28:06,930 --> 01:28:21,270
it's kind of crazy, but I'm old school, so, I'm old school, I've been doing it for so long, like, I know the old stuff, but everything has moved so beyond me.

984
01:28:21,530 --> 01:28:22,610
I'm a boomer!

985
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:28,870
People hating need to realize you don't need to be perfect and buy the book.

986
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:29,570
Yeah, exactly!

987
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:31,970
It's supposed to come from your soul.

988
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:34,450
It's supposed to come from, you know,

989
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:38,710
inside you.

990
01:28:38,890 --> 01:28:39,970
Don't forget that, okay?

991
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:43,610
Don't forget why you're screaming at a show, okay?

992
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:48,690
Don't just scream, the mix, just scream!

993
01:28:49,150 --> 01:28:50,210
Remember why!

994
01:28:50,890 --> 01:28:52,830
Remember why you're screaming.

995
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:54,890
Use code BOOMER at checkout!

996
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:02,400
Why, VTuber?

997
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:11,690
Not screaming for the sake of screaming.

998
01:29:12,910 --> 01:29:14,150
That's why it sounds so ugly.

999
01:29:14,910 --> 01:29:17,770
That's why it's like, you should make some mix videos to help educate us.

1000
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:21,890
Someone has asked me before, but I should.

1001
01:29:22,430 --> 01:29:22,810
I should.

1002
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:27,170
But again, I don't know.

1003
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:33,010
It's also, you know, beat counts and stuff too.

1004
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:35,530
There is an art to it.

1005
01:29:36,110 --> 01:29:37,230
There is an art to it.

1006
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,770
But again, I don't want people to be scared from it.

1007
01:29:40,010 --> 01:29:40,730
I think it's fun.

1008
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:41,950
It's very fun to learn.

1009
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:50,050
Honestly, you know, it's electrifying when you're in a room and everybody is doing all the mix together and everything.

1010
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:54,290
And you feel like you're truly bonded.

1011
01:29:54,430 --> 01:30:08,990
But you're truly bonded because, you know, you are there to support, you know, the idol or the singer.

1012
01:30:12,190 --> 01:30:14,190
What if people are scared of me doing it?

1013
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:14,970
That's good.

1014
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:19,010
Unleash the yakai in your soul.

1015
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:23,740
They should be scared.

1016
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:33,240
I was scared that my idol would think that I was scary doing mix, but then she called me an angel and I was like, no, I'm a ghost.

1017
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,540
I'm a ghost.

1018
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,180
It's so funny.

1019
01:30:42,660 --> 01:30:50,480
If you want to hear how much I love mix and how much I love doing otage and everything, I love it so much with a passion.

1020
01:30:50,620 --> 01:30:57,320
I love chikage, which is like kind of the dumber waza that you can do.

1021
01:30:58,080 --> 01:30:59,740
Sorry, I'm kind of nerding out a little bit.

1022
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:04,820
But I love it so much that there was an idol group that I used to so much love.

1023
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:05,920
I love them so much.

1024
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,740
Their fans were absolutely crazy.

1025
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:20,640
They were, they were some of the like, they were, they were so, they would get so yakai and it was so much fun and going to their lives was just like a huge party.

1026
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:27,220
And then my oshi did graduate and I was sad about that, but I was still following the group because I really liked them.

1027
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,040
And then there was this one girl who had joined.

1028
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,380
She was, she was a newer member.

1029
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:46,620
And one day she talked about, she, she posted a tweet that was just like, man, I hate when people yell too loud at our shows and you can't hear us singing.

1030
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:47,260
What's the point?

1031
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:52,240
And I was like, I got so mad.

1032
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:56,300
I got so mad I stopped supporting.

1033
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:01,520
I got so mad.

1034
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:02,680
I was just like, what do you mean?

1035
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,200
You joined this group.

1036
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:11,590
You joined this group and you knew that you were going to go and say that?

1037
01:32:13,050 --> 01:32:14,210
I was so angry.

1038
01:32:17,110 --> 01:32:22,130
Because I want to be able to, I want to be able to, but also, I don't know.

1039
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,590
It's been, it's been so weird.

1040
01:32:23,790 --> 01:32:28,470
Like now you have groups like iLife that basically feed you.

1041
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,710
It feels a little too manufactured.

1042
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:31,650
Like I like them.

1043
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:32,230
They're so cute.

1044
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:32,870
I love Aisu.

1045
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:34,750
But they feed you the calls.

1046
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:40,130
So there's probably some people listening who are like, I don't know what the hell you're, any two words you're saying right now, Minto.

1047
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:41,130
I'm so sorry.

1048
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:42,630
Hold on.

1049
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:44,750
I just gotta, I just gotta say things real quick.

1050
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:52,350
But it feels like a little too, like, manufactured, too force fed.

1051
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:54,490
I don't want, I don't want my calls to be force fed to me.

1052
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:58,850
Like the fun part about calls is, I mean, not to say that I've done this before.

1053
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:12,770
But you, like, basically, after like an idol releases a song or whatever, they'll go to dinner, they'll do like their own afk and then they will, and then they'll like come up with calls for, for that song.

1054
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:14,430
And it comes from the fans.

1055
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:21,310
So, you know, when it's, when it's not coming from the fans, it feels like a little too, too corporate.

1056
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:23,850
So I'm just like...

1057
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:36,290
Oh, I want, I want, I want it to be a good, fun thing for everybody.

1058
01:33:36,890 --> 01:33:37,530
That's all.

1059
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:38,950
That's all.

1060
01:33:40,770 --> 01:33:41,910
And you think that's a boomer take?

1061
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:43,270
I don't know.

1062
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,310
I don't know.

1063
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:53,730
Actually, really, in Japan, like mix is kind of a dying art in some circles.

1064
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:58,570
Because after the pandemic, people just stopped mixing.

1065
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:00,970
And I think it's so sad.

1066
01:34:02,050 --> 01:34:05,170
Because it's like one of the things I love the most about going to idol shows.

1067
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:12,290
It's what makes idol shows so uniquely the way that they are because of the way that fans have this special culture around it.

1068
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:21,570
So, yeah, not to say that it's completely dead or anything, but you know, it's...

1069
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:28,270
So that's why having this revival, or like the surge, I guess, in the West, it's not a revival, really.

1070
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:32,610
It's like the surge of people mixing in the West is so crazy to me.

1071
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:38,890
Should songs be written with calls in mind?

1072
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:40,890
I wouldn't say...

1073
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:44,990
Not always, but I like songs that way.

1074
01:34:46,770 --> 01:34:49,350
I like songs that way.

1075
01:34:49,870 --> 01:34:50,610
I think it's fun.

1076
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:55,140
Blame me for that.

1077
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:55,980
Blame me for what?

1078
01:34:56,260 --> 01:34:57,260
What did I do?

1079
01:34:57,300 --> 01:34:58,280
What are you blaming me for?

1080
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,060
What are we blaming Minto for?

1081
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:02,300
No!

1082
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,540
Hold on, my chat broke.

1083
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,220
Sorry for ranting a little bit.

1084
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:10,000
Thought I get revival?

1085
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,540
Nah, I didn't do anything.

1086
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:23,360
I didn't do anything.

1087
01:35:23,740 --> 01:35:29,880
I just did what I like to do and then people found it.

1088
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:31,920
Hmm.

1089
01:35:47,980 --> 01:35:53,280
I learned a lot about idol culture from you.

1090
01:35:53,380 --> 01:35:54,100
I'm so glad!

1091
01:35:55,260 --> 01:35:56,460
I'm so glad!

1092
01:35:57,740 --> 01:35:59,940
It's such a fun and unique world.

1093
01:36:00,620 --> 01:36:00,940
Truly.

1094
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,280
Truly, truly, truly.

1095
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,220
Love it so much.

1096
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,440
Okay, why shall we sing?

1097
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:19,900
Give me a suggestion.

1098
01:36:20,420 --> 01:36:21,080
Astro Bot.

1099
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:24,100
I am Astro Bot.

1100
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,000
Astro Bot.

1101
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,120
I am Astro Bot.

1102
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,040
Astro Bot.

1103
01:36:36,220 --> 01:36:38,340
I'm going to sing maybe three more songs.

1104
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:40,340
We'll go to 20.

1105
01:36:46,420 --> 01:36:47,060
Fans voting.

1106
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,320
I learned it from you Minto.

1107
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:49,380
I learned it from you.

1108
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,120
I love sharing about the culture.

1109
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:53,540
I love you sharing about the culture.

1110
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:54,040
Thanks!

1111
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,960
Can you do Everlasting Guilty Crown by Egoist?

1112
01:36:56,060 --> 01:36:57,680
I don't know and I'm sorry!

1113
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,700
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

1114
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,580
I don't know what I want to do.

1115
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:08,500
I don't know.

1116
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,980
Maybe I'll try that one next time.

1117
01:37:22,780 --> 01:37:24,180
Another song with calls.

1118
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:29,100
What would be a good song with calls?

1119
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:30,380
I could just do the calls.

1120
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,560
No, it's okay.

1121
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:32,920
It's okay.

1122
01:37:36,280 --> 01:37:37,120
Oh wait!

1123
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,700
Someone asked me to sing this one earlier.

1124
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,340
I'll sing this one.

1125
01:38:36,690 --> 01:38:38,690
I don't know.

1126
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:02,990
Right here!

1127
01:39:03,310 --> 01:39:03,750
Right now!

1128
01:39:33,290 --> 01:39:36,090
That's right!

1129
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:41,110
That's right!

1130
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,370
Fighting Dreamers!

1131
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:43,790
Right

1132
01:39:52,160 --> 01:40:10,800
here!

1133
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,860
Right now!

1134
01:40:49,380 --> 01:40:49,860
Yay!

1135
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:40,840
Yay!

1136
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:41,880
That was cool!

1137
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:43,180
By Flo!

1138
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:45,780
It's my first time in Atlanta!

1139
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:46,720
Can't wait to see you tomorrow!

1140
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:48,460
See you tomorrow!

1141
01:41:54,860 --> 01:41:55,740
What's that from?

1142
01:41:58,740 --> 01:42:00,320
Magical Cure Love Shop Miku.

1143
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:03,460
I only know the one part.

1144
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:07,860
Now it's time for the moment you've been waiting for!

1145
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,460
One, two...

1146
01:42:11,480 --> 01:42:11,880
Ready?

1147
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:15,640
Miku Miku Piiiii!

1148
01:42:17,980 --> 01:42:19,300
Keep going!

1149
01:42:24,430 --> 01:42:24,930
Piiiii!

1150
01:42:38,780 --> 01:42:40,400
Thanks for the karaoke Minto!

1151
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:43,760
Helps fight the concert FOMO while I explore Akiba!

1152
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:44,500
What do you mean?

1153
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:48,420
Why would you have concert FOMO if you are in Akiba?

1154
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:50,340
I want to switch spots with you.

1155
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:53,760
Nozomi!

1156
01:42:53,940 --> 01:42:54,440
Welcome to membership!

1157
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,320
Thank you!

1158
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,760
Akiba guide where?

1159
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,300
Oh, you can just search my video.

1160
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,040
I did an Akiba tour.

1161
01:43:09,620 --> 01:43:11,040
Someone requested something.

1162
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:11,820
Wait, hold on.

1163
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:14,260
It made me think of something else.

1164
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:18,600
Minto Minto Miiii!

1165
01:43:19,240 --> 01:43:20,320
Enjoy the concert Minto!

1166
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:21,240
Thank you!

1167
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:23,340
Thank you so much for the 5 gifted!

1168
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:25,180
What's the dress code for tomorrow night?

1169
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:27,920
Birthday suit.

1170
01:43:28,700 --> 01:43:29,180
Spank!

1171
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:30,200
Thanks for the 10 gifted!

1172
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,120
Oh, that's what...hold on.

1173
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:38,080
Hold on.

1174
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:38,960
What's it called?

1175
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,480
I saw someone's eye.

1176
01:43:43,940 --> 01:43:45,020
There it is.

1177
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:45,600
That's the anime.

1178
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,300
Virtual!

1179
01:43:52,420 --> 01:43:52,980
Thanks for the gifted!

1180
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:57,560
Please fire a beam at me and free me from this Mortal Kombat coil.

1181
01:43:58,320 --> 01:43:59,180
Are you okay?

1182
01:44:04,420 --> 01:44:06,160
Oh no, this is not the one I want to do.

1183
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:11,620
Here we go.

1184
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:13,680
This is the one I wanted.

1185
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,180
I think someone requested this one earlier.

1186
01:44:15,300 --> 01:44:16,880
If I got it wrong, I'm so sorry.

1187
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:21,320
Someone requested maybe this song.

1188
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:22,820
Maybe.

1189
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:05,020
Here we go.

1190
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:37,220
Feels

1191
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:50,840
good!

1192
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:34,490
Don't scout me.

1193
01:46:34,710 --> 01:46:38,450
If you don't think so, let's destroy everything.

1194
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:40,350
It's the moon.

1195
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:46,890
If your eyes dry up, you won't be able to sleep well.

1196
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,170
Let's go!

1197
01:46:48,390 --> 01:46:48,950
It's so

1198
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:00,340
exciting!

1199
01:47:01,800 --> 01:47:02,520
Madness!

1200
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:03,360
Madness!

1201
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,020
You wanna madness!

1202
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:08,300
If you call me, I'll be more intense and more exciting.

1203
01:47:08,520 --> 01:47:09,220
Madness!

1204
01:47:11,190 --> 01:47:11,730
Madness!

1205
01:47:12,090 --> 01:47:13,970
If you call me, it'll be the end.

1206
01:47:59,080 --> 01:47:59,560
Madness!

1207
01:48:01,660 --> 01:48:02,140
Madness!

1208
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:03,680
Gay horse!

1209
01:48:26,140 --> 01:48:27,100
Gay horse!

1210
01:48:27,260 --> 01:48:27,700
Gay horse!

1211
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:28,700
Is it really gay horse?

1212
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:30,420
I mean, maybe.

1213
01:48:39,060 --> 01:48:40,620
Thank you for the super!

1214
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,560
Got here just in time to hear my wife's song.

1215
01:48:52,850 --> 01:48:53,730
That was...

1216
01:48:56,230 --> 01:48:58,670
Let me put my mic down for this.

1217
01:48:58,810 --> 01:48:59,930
I've been holding it this whole time.

1218
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:05,530
Let's...

1219
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:21,100
Snake eater?

1220
01:49:21,340 --> 01:49:22,360
OK, I'll do snake eater.

1221
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:23,540
I haven't done it in a minute.

1222
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,660
Is that true?

1223
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:27,900
I don't know if that's true.

1224
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:32,180
I don't know, but... I don't know actually.

1225
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,440
I don't know.

1226
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,560
This one.

1227
01:50:15,570 --> 01:50:18,270
And I'll melt into you.

1228
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:24,210
What a fear in my heart.

1229
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:28,050
But you're so supreme.

1230
01:50:30,970 --> 01:50:33,610
I give my life.

1231
01:50:33,990 --> 01:50:35,310
Not for order.

1232
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:40,420
Snake eater!

1233
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:41,460
Snake eater!

1234
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,140
In my time.

1235
01:50:45,140 --> 01:50:52,620
There'll be no one else.

1236
01:50:52,760 --> 01:50:53,980
Crime.

1237
01:50:55,420 --> 01:51:00,600
It's the way I fly to you.

1238
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:08,120
I'm still in a dream.

1239
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,860
Snake eater.

1240
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:12,800
I give my life.

1241
01:51:13,200 --> 01:51:18,520
And someday you'll go through the rain.

1242
01:51:19,360 --> 01:51:23,980
And someday you'll feed on a tree frog.

1243
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:28,620
This ordeal, that trial to survive.

1244
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:35,700
For the day we see new light.

1245
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:37,800
I give my

1246
01:51:44,930 --> 01:51:45,130
life.

1247
01:51:45,130 --> 01:51:46,330
Snake eater.

1248
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:49,930
In my time.

1249
01:51:51,150 --> 01:51:57,860
There'll be no one else.

1250
01:51:58,540 --> 01:51:59,300
Crime.

1251
01:52:00,900 --> 01:52:06,220
It's the way I fly to you.

1252
01:52:08,360 --> 01:52:13,480
I'm still in a dream.

1253
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:15,280
Snake eater.

1254
01:52:24,100 --> 01:52:29,420
I'm still in a dream.

1255
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,620
Snake eater.

1256
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:38,260
Snake, snake, snake, snake, snake, snake.

1257
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:39,480
Snake eater.

1258
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:52,180
Snake eater.

1259
01:52:59,630 --> 01:53:00,270
Eater.

1260
01:53:00,790 --> 01:53:01,290
Snake eater.

1261
01:53:01,290 --> 01:53:03,270
Last song, everybody.

1262
01:53:05,170 --> 01:53:06,390
Last song.

1263
01:53:06,490 --> 01:53:07,110
Shadow Cross!

1264
01:53:07,150 --> 01:53:08,230
Thank you for the 5 gifted!

1265
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:09,290
And KM!

1266
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:13,190
Can't go to concert due to geographic impairment, but wish you two luck.

1267
01:53:13,310 --> 01:53:16,250
And happy birthday, KM!

1268
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:19,890
Happy birthday to you.

1269
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:22,650
Happy birthday to you.

1270
01:53:23,170 --> 01:53:26,030
Happy birthday, dear KM.

1271
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:31,910
Happy birthday to you.

1272
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:37,070
Happy birthday, sorry if I get sleepy.

1273
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:41,510
I'm glad that I feel calmed down from the cabin stream.

1274
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,500
Wait,

1275
01:53:57,540 --> 01:53:57,980
hold on.

1276
01:54:01,580 --> 01:54:03,720
What did you say?

1277
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:07,760
OK.

1278
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:13,140
Marry on a cross?

1279
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:16,500
Oh gosh, I don't know if my voice can do it.

1280
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,620
Haven't done that song in a long time.

1281
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:21,280
I do like that song.

1282
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:23,500
Silver Wraith!

1283
01:54:23,580 --> 01:54:24,580
I'll be at a different concert.

1284
01:54:24,580 --> 01:54:26,780
Sonic Symphony when you're having yours.

1285
01:54:28,020 --> 01:54:28,340
OK.

1286
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:30,220
Have fun, I guess.

1287
01:54:30,380 --> 01:54:30,960
No, I'm just kidding.

1288
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:33,940
Thank you for all the good times you've given me.

1289
01:54:34,020 --> 01:54:37,460
I hope you have all the time of your lives at FTR.

1290
01:54:37,860 --> 01:54:39,400
And our after lives.

1291
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:53,360
I guess since I haven't done this one in a while, but I want to change the...

1292
01:54:57,790 --> 01:54:59,690
Maybe it's a kind of fun song to end on.

1293
01:55:00,350 --> 01:55:01,830
Let me change the pitch.

1294
01:55:03,490 --> 01:55:05,290
Maybe the key can go up two.

1295
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:06,770
Or four.

1296
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:08,370
Let me try a four.

1297
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:26,090
It's gonna sound like a chipmunk.

1298
01:55:40,630 --> 01:56:13,850
But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high And the truth of the matter is, I'll never let you go, let you go We were scanning the cities, walking to greater dues But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruise But through all the sorrow, we've earned

1299
01:56:19,060 --> 01:56:25,020
what the matter is I'll never let you go, let you go

1300
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:59,950
You go and tell the psychotic Mary across Not just another bloody Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross If you choose to run away with me I will tingle you eternally And I see nothing wrong with that Guys, I think I messed up with the pitch.

1301
01:57:00,170 --> 01:57:00,890
I think it's...

1302
01:57:00,890 --> 01:57:01,170
Uh-oh.

1303
01:57:01,830 --> 01:57:02,230
Uh-oh.

1304
01:57:02,350 --> 01:57:04,550
I don't know why I always mess up with the pitch on this song.

1305
01:57:04,770 --> 01:57:05,270
Oh gosh.

1306
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:06,110
Oh god.

1307
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:06,910
Uh-oh.

1308
01:57:07,130 --> 01:57:07,950
I think I'm in trouble.

1309
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:42,250
We were searching for reasons to play by the rule But we quickly found out it was just for fools Not for all the sorrow, we'll be riding high And the truth of the matter is, I'll never let you go, let you go

1310
01:57:45,490 --> 01:57:54,850
I'm scared I'm scared You go down just like holy Mary across

1311
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:01,740
Not just another bloody Mary,

1312
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:37,460
Mariana You go down just like holy Mary, Mariana, Mariana Cross Your beauty never ever scared me, Mariana, Mariana Cross If you choose to run away with me, I will tingle you eternally And I see nothing wrong with that I

1313
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:47,470
can't go higher Nothing wrong with that

1314
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:54,430
Nothing wrong with that

1315
01:59:11,970 --> 01:59:12,490
Yay!

1316
01:59:15,650 --> 01:59:17,210
Sorry for butchering it.

1317
01:59:17,290 --> 01:59:17,730
Sorry!

1318
01:59:18,810 --> 01:59:19,970
Thank you guys!

1319
01:59:20,070 --> 01:59:21,170
Thank you for the karaoke!

1320
01:59:21,850 --> 01:59:26,630
Hopefully, I'll see you now with this, plus this other stream from today that makes up for 3 hours.

1321
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:27,610
My quota.

1322
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:30,290
Yay!

1323
01:59:30,290 --> 01:59:30,350
Yay!

1324
01:59:31,430 --> 01:59:33,830
Be fun to do an album, listen along to some of Neil C.

1325
01:59:33,890 --> 01:59:37,570
Cierga's music There was one time I did a road trip and we just listened to Neil C.

1326
01:59:37,670 --> 01:59:45,010
Cierga's album the entire time Of course, Bustin' and Eye of the Tiger are my favorites.

1327
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:52,530
Those are the only two I can remember It's the Eye of the Tiger, it's the thrill of the tiger Nora Ika!

1328
01:59:53,970 --> 01:59:55,990
Thank you for the 20 gifted, thank you!

1329

For those who will be going to the concert, thank you so much!

1331
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:12,170
We really really appreciate it Doki and I are nervous as heck, but...

1332
02:00:17,170 --> 02:00:41,670
It's gonna be a really fun show, the setlist is really really fun and really goofy And I think a good mix of fun stuff and silly stuff So I think you guys will really really love it And if you guys can't go, I'll always be working hard to hopefully have more opportunities like this in the future So that I can hopefully come to you one day!

1333
02:00:42,110 --> 02:00:55,670
And if you're just like, I can't, I can't get out of this city, Minto I can't leave this city One day I'll come to your city, one day, hopefully, I'll do my best to reach many many places all over!

1334
02:00:56,070 --> 02:01:12,430
So, yeah, and we will be uploading some of the concert To YouTube, to my channel, and also people will be recording, so Of course, since you are a wisp, you are there in spirit!
