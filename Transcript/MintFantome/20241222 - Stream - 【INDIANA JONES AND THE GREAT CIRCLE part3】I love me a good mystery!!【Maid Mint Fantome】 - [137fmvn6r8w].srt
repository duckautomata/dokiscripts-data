Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,250
Howdy!

3
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,490
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

4
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,950
Howdy, howdy, howdy!

5
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,270
Hello!

6
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,330
Congrats on 300k.

7
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,370
Thank you!

8
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,590
Hello Minky!

9
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:19,350
Hello!

10
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,130
Minky!

11
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,630
Minky!

12
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,810
What do you mean wrong hat?

13
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,650
This is Indiana Jones.

14
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,720
Thank you for the congratulations!

15
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,140
Thank you!

16
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,960
Happy National Short Girl Appreciation Day.

17
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,500
We appreciate you.

18
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,500
And you are... I'm just kidding.

19
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,460
Cute little ghost self.

20
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,480
I'm average size.

21
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,100
Why is it National Short Girl Appreciation Day?

22
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,680
Oh my god.

23
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:32,540
I just got home actually because I went out shopping for some Christmas presents for my mom.

24
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,100
And...

25
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,160
I went to this one place and I was like looking and it's like a...

26
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,060
How do you say?

27
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,780
Like locally made things or... Not locally.

28
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,880
Like a... How do you say it?

29
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,880
Like trinkets and things like that.

30
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,280
I don't know.

31
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,420
They might be locally made.

32
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,720
I have no idea.

33
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,620
But I went...

34
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,980
Flea market?

35
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,360
Farmer market?

36
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:02,840
Maybe.

37
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,640
I was like I'll look and see if they have any cute... My mom likes little trinkets.

38
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,380
Artisan.

39
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,460
Artisan.

40
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,580
Yeah!

41
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,280
I went in and there was a towel that had gnomes on it.

42
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,780
I like pointed at it and went...

43
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,540
Gnomes.

44
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,680
And the owner of the store...

45
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,980
The owner of the store...

46
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,040
I didn't know she was around and she saw me and she was like...

47
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,160
You like gnomes?

48
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,320
I got plenty of gnomes.

49
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,500
I was like...

50
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,220
I feel like the thumbnail misled me.

51
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:49,600
No!

52
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,500
That's why I censored them!

53
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,260
I censored Matara and Doki because they are not in the stream.

54
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,600
That's why I censored them.

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,540
You got misled on your own terms.

56
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,860
But yeah, she was like I got a lot of Christmas gnomes.

57
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,500
And I was like...

58
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,220
I'm gonna go now.

59
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,740
Minky, minky, minky, minky, minky!

60
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,260
Thank you!

61
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,500
Thanks SakiSoho!

62
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,940
Congrats on 300k minky!

63
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,080
So proud of you.

64
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,440
Thank you!

65
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,660
Minky, minky, minky, minky!

66
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,400

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,360
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!

68
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,920
Thank you.

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,260
Thank you.

70
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:43,800
Thank you.

71
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,340
Thank you.

72
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:44,960
Thank you.

73
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,300
Thank you.

74
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,420
Thank you.

75
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,960
Thank you.

76
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,760
Thank you.

77
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,680
Hi.

78
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,800
Hi.

79
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
Thank you guys for the 8 months.

80
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,540
Florian, thank you for the 9 months.

81
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,360
Hashtag free the Mataras Matas.

82
00:07:59,660 --> 00:07:59,900
No!

83
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,040
It's all focus on Minky.

84
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,640
No focus on Matara.

85
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,700
Ever.

86
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,200
All Mintos, no Matara.

87
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,620
This is Mint channel.

88
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
Mid Mint channel.

89
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,400
Sisa, thanks for the 20 gifted.

90
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,040
Thank you.

91
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,400
Thank you.

92
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
Thanks for the congratulations.

93
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,820
Yippee!

94
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Thank you.

95
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Matara, you sussy Ohio.

96
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,180
Exactly.

97
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,260
I'm focus on her momo.

98
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,620
Shut up!

99
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,740
You are at the...

100
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,400
You are at the wrong place!

101
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,720
Do you have a favorite flower, Minky?

102
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,560
Favorite flower is...

103
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,500
Hydrangea.

104
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,140
Ojisai.

105
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,420
You didn't notice the sensors?

106
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,360
Yeah, they just...

107
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,700
Matara and Doki just fade into obscurity.

108
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,300
It's fine.

109
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,880
It's fine.

110
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,700
Mintos all over.

111
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,560
Okay, Stuart, thank you, but please stop spamming or I have to time you out.

112
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,600
I heard Matara and came running.

113
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,160
Oh, hi there.

114
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,300
I also wanted to say...

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,960
I was supposed to do Devil May Cry 3 today.

116
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,320
But I didn't get a lot of sleep.

117
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,120
And then I knew that I was going to have to go and run a bunch of errands before stream.

118
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,600
I literally just got home like 10 minutes ago.

119
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:53,020
Oh, wait, it's 10 minutes into the stream now.

120
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,020
20 minutes ago.

121
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,040
And I was like, I wanna be, you know...

122
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,380
Full focus for Devil May Cry since it's such an intensive gaming experience.

123
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,320
So...

124
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,360
I was just like, well, you know, I was trying to finish up Indiana Jones anyway.

125
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,760
And this is a game...

126
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,740
Like, last time I played it, the other day, I was like, oh my gosh, it's been 5 hours.

127
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,560
I could go another 5 hours.

128
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,800
Kind of dealio, so I was like...

129
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm gonna... I could maybe...

130
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,280
If I just play as much as I want today, I might be able to beat it.

131
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Who knows?

132
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,000
So...

133
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,920
You're the boss.

134
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,080
I appreciate you guys being so patient with me.

135
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,620
But of course there will be...

136
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,000
So I was gonna have Indiana Jones on Monday.

137
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,240
So I just changed the...

138
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,060
The...

139
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,600
The Devil May Cry to Monday instead.

140
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,880
Hot dog.

141
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,880
Hot dog indeed.

142
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,140
Indeed.

143
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:04,060
Indiana Jones games have come a far way since Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari...

144
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:04,460
What?

145
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,300
For the Atari?

146
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,280
I've never played any other...

147
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,800
Any other Indiana Jones games.

148
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,220
Angry car trains.

149
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,020
Welcome to membership.

150
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,820
Thank you.

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,460
Hi 300k Minto.

152
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,220
Hello.

153
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,480
Always Jushimatsu.

154
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,520
Profile picture of Hazinger.

155
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,200
Who was sub number 300k?

156
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,020
Who knows?

157
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,580
Maybe the sub number 300k was you.

158
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,660
Was it you Rainy?

159
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,000
Rainy is like, I'm asking but actually...

160
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,560
It was me.

161
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,760
It was me.

162
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,380
It might have been me.

163
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,500
It was you.

164
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,080
It was me.

165
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,100
It was all me and my 300k accounts.

166
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,400
I know right now I'm typing at the speed of light as all of you guys.

167
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,060
I'm cosplaying as a successful streamer.

168
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:02,560
Maybe.

169
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,360
I'm cosplaying as someone who...

170
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,540
A streamer who has people watching them.

171
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,080
It's me in the chat.

172
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,280
All me in the chat.

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,780
Thank you for the 50 gifts.

174
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,200
Thank you so much.

175
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,800
Thank you.

176
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,040
We're fine.

177
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,300
That was weird.

178
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,720
Thank you for the gift.

179
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,380
Everything is ok.

180
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,200
Everything is ok.

181
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,100
I am Minto and so is my wife.

182
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,040
Our wife?

183
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,610
Are we sharing wives?

184
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,090
We share everything.

185
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,930
We share secrets.

186
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,830
What's your secret?

187
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,330
Just pretend I'm your journal.

188
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,330
Actually, don't do that.

189
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,850
Actually, wait a second.

190
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:39,480
How many Indiana Jones games have there been?

191
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,120
Hi, Doomguy.

192
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:44,900
It's been a while.

193
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,060
Hi, I am new.

194
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,460
Hello.

195
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,520
Welcome, welcome.

196
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,840
Thank you, Ryan, for the superchat.

197
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,560
Minto saw... Dear Mint, I saw a cute girl at the store.

198
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,320
What do I do?

199
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,240
Run back straight to...

200
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,180
Made Mint channel.

201
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,160
And don't forget who you're loyal to.

202
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,460
Thank you so much for the 50 gifts.

203
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,940
Thank you.

204
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,140
Thank you.

205
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,340
Thank you so much.

206
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,160
Dear journal, Minto is extra cute today.

207
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,040
I feel blessed.

208
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,840
My magic.

209
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,640
Dear diary, today I got home and opened up the Minto stream.

210
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,560
You're doing it!

211
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,460
You're doing it correctly!

212
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,200
You're doing it correctly.

213
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,040
You're doing it correctly.

214
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,960
I'm loyal to the mission, boss.

215
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,540
I'm saluting.

216
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,540
You just can't see.

217
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,340
My hands are up.

218
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,780
Anyway.

219
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:51,900
Anyway.

220
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,580
Last time we... Indeed.

221
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,960
For some reason, I don't know.

222
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,580
I try... Or rather...

223
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,920
Back up.

224
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,360
Sorry.

225
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,220
My brain moves at a speed.

226
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,980
I tried changing, going into the options.

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,720
Changing video stuff.

228
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,120
But I think because it's Xbox.

229
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,820
There's no way to improve graphics.

230
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,120
So maybe... But also, today I feel like it looks a little funky.

231
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,720
I don't know.

232
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,140
There's like something about the textures.

233
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,240
I booted it up and I was like, what?

234
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,940
It looks strange.

235
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,320
Console has less options than PC.

236
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,040
Yeah, I didn't even think about it.

237
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,560
I was just like, oh yeah, because I transferred everything from PC to console.

238
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,620
So, since I originally played this on the PC and then I made my computer go...

239
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you!

240
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,420
Happy.

241
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,460
Happy that you're happy here!

242
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,500
Thank you!

243
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,860
V-dog.

244
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,200
V-dog.

245
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,560
Can't believe I fought...

246
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,620
Oh.

247
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,660
I can't believe I fought me Psycho Mantis for your Christmas presents.

248
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,440
So you like gnomes?

249
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,820
I don't like gnomes.

250
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,540
I just thought it was funny seeing a gnome on a towel.

251
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,660
And then the lady was like, you like gnomes?

252
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,620
There's a bit of a dirt on my monitor screen.

253
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,520
Right where your face is and it looks like a booger is hanging out your nose.

254
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,480
Clean your screen?

255
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,720
Like, don't blame me.

256
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,380
Don't be like, haha Minto, looks like you have a booger hanging from your nose.

257
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,040
Maybe you should have your monitor cleaned?

258
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,630
Gonna miss you, won't be here until next year.

259
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:03,690
Oh my gosh, no.

260
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:06,850
Nan, I'll see you next year!

261
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,810
Dear diary, I just recovered from the flu.

262
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,710
Then Minto streamed early.

263
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:14,230
Is this my reward for trying best to recover?

264
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:14,890
Yeah!

265
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,570
Aw, Yog, feel better!

266
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,230
She got a dirty nose like a two year old.

267
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,110
God, yeah.

268
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,450
Yeah, I got, I just, you know...

269
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,950
I get everything all over my face.

270
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:33,530
I eat, and there's just like...

271
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,850
What's like a messy food?

272
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,030
Pudding.

273
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,070
I eat pudding and it's just...

274
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,990
Slobber, like pudding all around my lips.

275
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,310
Spaghetti, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

276
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:48,270
I got spaghetti underneath my fingernails from picking it up with my hands.

277
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:53,150
Just, just that's, you know...

278
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,310
I got spaghetti up my nose.

279
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,170
Spaghetti everywhere.

280
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,750
What?

281
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,670
What?

282
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,470
Yeah.

283
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:11,230
Last time we played Indiana Jones.

284
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,430
We...

285
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,470
They mentioned the great circle.

286
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:17,570
Oh my god, that person.

287
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,710
There was a lady in the background.

288
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,930
And her arms were kind of glitching around.

289
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,790
It looked like she was doing the...

290
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,730
Wait, they don't love me like I do.

291
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:34,830
Wait, they don't love you like I do.

292
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,490
It looks like she was doing that dance.

293
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,850
I don't promise, but we'll return if there's Ace Combat 8.

294
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,130
Okay.

295
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:44,690
That's not on me though.

296
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,510
Congrats on 300k.

297
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,070
Thank you!

298
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,610
But yeah, so...

299
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,010
And then we also discovered right after I ended was that...

300
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,250
They were tracking my dad or Indy's dad.

301
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,310
They were tracking Indiana Jones.

302
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,850
Like, they've been...

303
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,630
They've been watching him.

304
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:09,810
They've been watching him sleep.

305
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,270
They've been collecting his hair.

306
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,350
Putting it in jars.

307
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,270
They've been collecting his...

308
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,010
His pant pocket lint and everything.

309
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,750
They're obsessed with him.

310
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:23,130
Dear Diary, there's been a lot of stuff to do at work.

311
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,050
However, Mintos started streaming and my day became better.

312
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,850
Here in the office.

313
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,250
So is Snake!

314
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,310
No!

315
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,110
Snakes don't belong in offices.

316
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,190
Have a good day at work!

317
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:37,110
Oh my god, those twins over there almost kissed.

318
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:38,250
That was kind of crazy.

319
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,210
But if we continue onward...

320
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,990
Welcome back.

321
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,950
I also noticed, if anybody has motion sick stuff...

322
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,090
I noticed that motion blur was turned on last time.

323
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,230
I'm so sorry.

324
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,750
I thought it was turned off.

325
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,990
What am I wearing?

326
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,100
I am...

327
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,500
I am a normal guy.

328
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,840
So yeah, I'm really sorry.

329
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:19,360
I know that this game can be tough for some people because of it being first person.

330
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,360
And I think I look around a little erratically, so...

331
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,100
I apologize.

332
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,020
I'm wearing...

333
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,740
Alright, so...

334
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,600
Yeah, we discovered that they were stalking us and we saw a cat and we saw a dog and it was very cute.

335
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,160
I liked that part.

336
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,180
Hey man.

337
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,160
This is my best buddy right here.

338
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,000
Yup.

339
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,760
We are pals, aren't we?

340
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,480
Who are you staring at like that?

341
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,060
Oh, me?

342
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,130
Oh, he's scratching his butt.

343
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,410
That's my minky.

344
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,610
Who's this smelly guy?

345
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,150
This is...

346
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,010
This is...

347
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,050
This is Bradley.

348
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,070
Bradley is like the best...

349
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,450
Oh, he's talking to us.

350
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,810
What we're...

351
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,450
Sorry.

352
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,210
Bless you, Bradley.

353
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,750
He's our best friend.

354
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,090
What are you talking about?

355
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,410
He went, who is we?

356
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,670
Nah, everybody at the camp knows us.

357
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,450
Everyone around here knows...

358
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,450
Bradley and Indy.

359
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:41,770
The double...

360
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,530
The double guys.

361
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,430
Oh, bless you.

362
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:45,910
Gosh.

363
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,950
He's smiling at me.

364
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:51,270
Oh, hello.

365
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,050
You okay?

366
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,910
Why are you so frustrated about?

367
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,650
He's kissing me.

368
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:04,570
Bradley.

369
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,430
I didn't know you wanted to take our relationship that far.

370
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,310
I don't think I'm ready.

371
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,150
I need time to think about this.

372
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,750
I need time to think about this.

373
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,470
Bless you.

374
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,410
That was a lot of words just for saying hi.

375
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,470
You're sick now.

376
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,790
Oh gosh.

377
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,650
I'm gonna catch whatever they have.

378
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,730
I see Joaquin like he pooped his pants.

379
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,770
He actually might have.

380
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:42,810
He actually might have pooped his pants.

381
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,670
Friendship ended with Bradley.

382
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,630
I think he's checking me out.

383
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:51,670
Hi.

384
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,150
Why do they become so...

385
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:14,300
Why do they like look at you like that when you stare at them for so...

386
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,980
When you look at them they become like so soft.

387
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,880
What happened?

388
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,460
Oh my god.

389
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,160
What snack do you think I should...

390
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Oh my gosh, Broca!

391
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:29,840
It's been forever.

392
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,440
What snack should I get?

393
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,720
Fruit gummies.

394
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,300
Cap'n Crunch.

395
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,400
Persimmons.

396
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,140
Brie.

397
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:37,900
Ice cream.

398
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,260
Popcorn.

399
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,180
Popcorn!

400
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,400
Mix the popcorn and the Cap'n Crunch.

401
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,720
It's the salty and sweet.

402
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,520
Josh Boy, welcome to membership.

403
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,920
Thank you so much.

404
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,860
Kurochina, happy birthday!

405
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,860
May I request one happy birthday song from Lee Minto?

406
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,520
Of course you can!

407
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,520
Happy birthday to you.

408
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,620
Happy birthday to you.

409
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,160
Happy birthday, Kurochina.

410
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:16,880
Happy birthday to you.

411
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,020
Happy birthday!

412
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,540
Alright, enough clowning around, guys.

413
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,780
So, let's see.

414
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,620
Last time I had also finished all the fieldwork.

415
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,220
We had some discoveries like the underground boxing ring.

416
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,920
Whatever this riddle of the ancients is.

417
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:40,640
These discoveries, these are the ones that I don't plan on completing all of them.

418
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,520
You know, to 100% the game or anything like that.

419
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,660
It's all good.

420
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,980
We have some lost artifacts we haven't gotten.

421
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,380
Wow, we're only missing 5 medicine bottles.

422
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,100
That's pretty good.

423
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,760
Guys, I'm late.

424
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,460
What have you missed?

425
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,000
You missed...

426
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,360
You missed us getting 2 boyfriends.

427
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,660
You missed us getting 2...

428
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,660
Watch, watch, watch this.

429
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,940
GF skill, watch this, watch this.

430
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,120
Watch him become so soft for us.

431
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,840
He's just melting looking at us.

432
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,740
Look.

433
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,820
Are you whistling?

434
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,220
How is that coming out of your mouth?

435
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,520
Ok, maybe...

436
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,280
Ok, nevermind.

437
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,100
Ok, maybe...

438
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,380
Maybe it was only the first time.

439
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,000
Ok.

440
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,360
This bro's hair thinning.

441
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,120
Don't be mean to him.

442
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,840
He just...

443
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,740
Hello.

444
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,380
He just needs, you know...

445
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,260
The Riz is fading away.

446
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,540
Maybe we were like a novelty at first.

447
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,380
And now he's seen us again and he's like, you know what, actually...

448
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:02,960
Ah...

449
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,100
Oh.

450
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,580
Pirate, I just saw your thing.

451
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,220
Since you have a capture card and are streaming from a different device anyway, couldn't you just use your laptop for VTube Studio and OBS and play the game from your main PC?

452
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,860
Technically, I guess.

453
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,060
But...

454
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:23,620
My laptop doesn't handle other stuff well either.

455
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,940
I don't know.

456
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,080
I don't really have a place to put other things.

457
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,700
My maid cafe where I stream is quite small.

458
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,660
All things considered.

459
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,600
That's also my fault.

460
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,240
I buy a lot of trinkets.

461
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:47,180
So, now we're going to go investigate the fountain.

462
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,820
And, I think, move on to another area.

463
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:53,760
No!

464
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,300
Bradley, you're hungry!

465
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,900
He's hungry.

466
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,480
Someone feed him.

467
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,800
Oh my god, it looks like a ghost in there.

468
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,560
It's kind of freaky.

469
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,760
Oh shoot.

470
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,260
I was like, what just happened?

471
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,900
We almost got caught.

472
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,920
But we didn't.

473
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,200
We're too good.

474
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,520
This way?

475
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,420
Up this way.

476
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,040
This guy might catch us though.

477
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,800
I'm scared of him.

478
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,740
I'm just walking.

479
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:25,680
Oh my god.

480
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,180
Okay, he didn't notice.

481
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,620
We're okay.

482
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,600
He didn't notice.

483
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,500
Nice.

484
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,060
Over here.

485
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,580
Over here?

486
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,100
While I was in Atlanta, a wisp sneezed and someone Tascaru'd them in real life.

487
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,720
I love VTubers.

488
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,480
Yeah, you guys...

489
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,300
I feel like becoming a VTuber fan kind of alters your everything.

490
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,820
Fountain of Confession.

491
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,120
Gotta turn it up a little bit.

492
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,740
Oh yeah, that's right.

493
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,300
We went to a place and like...

494
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,980
And we saw like the grave and everything.

495
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,040
Oh wait, so what's it?

496
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,960
Investigate the fountain and use the camera for hints.

497
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,300
Okay, let's see what this says.

498
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,220
Oh, tit.

499
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,440
Nice.

500
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,460
Okay.

501
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,820
What else we got?

502
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,940
Morten, thank you so much for the 10 Gibson!

503
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,620
She is not interested in your story at all.

504
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:02,860
I think they might hate each other.

505
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,060
Let's see.

506
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,910
This is such a cool fountain if it worked.

507
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,530
Like it's so...

508
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,570
Look at his little paw.

509
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:19,630
Oh, here we go.

510
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,260
Oh, can we go in here?

511
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,440
Requires fountain gate key.

512
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,340
They are gate keying us.

513
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Do I need to eat?

514
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,340
Is anyone watching?

515
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,560
Well, isn't that just handy dandy?

516
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,160
Finally finished the indie movie VOD on the topic of indie games.

517
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,060
I wish they finished making the one that would have used the forced unleashed engine.

518
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,780
What one would that have been?

519
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:12,930
Chomp.

520
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:14,990
Chomp?

521
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,210
How do I eat this again?

522
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,710
Wait, how do I eat it again?

523
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,330
I can't remember.

524
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,030
Wait.

525
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,590
Oh, is it because I'm full?

526
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,190
Oh, I forgot that the fruit is for the stamina.

527
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,630
And... what's this?

528
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,970
Open that.

529
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,170
It's red.

530
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,510
Maybe with the...

531
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,830
It looks like it can be opened, right?

532
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:10,870
Hmm...

533
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,490
I don't think it works.

534
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,330
Denied.

535
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,830
Do I have to get the lock specifically?

536
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,270
I don't think so.

537
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,590
Why does it turn red though?

538
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:30,310
Like I can hit it, you know?

539
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,610
The hitbox is finicky?

540
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,650
Okay.

541
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,830
Come on!

542
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,370
Come on!

543
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,540
If I crouch, it makes me stand up.

544
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
I don't think I'm hitting it.

545
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,860
I think I need to like... okay, okay, hold on.

546
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:04,780
No.

547
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,880
Use the rake?

548
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,080
Let's try the rake instead.

549
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,190
Oh my God.

550
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,810
So much money in here.

551
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,930
Holy moly!

552
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,170
Wait, why is there silly music?

553
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,860
Is it because I stole?

554
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,040
Nobody saw me.

555
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,940
Nobody saw me!

556
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,360
Open up, baby.

557
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,480
Oh, I put on my Indiana Jones outfit.

558
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:56,940
Okay.

559
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,400
I guess we don't want to be a guy.

560
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:01,860
Sure.

561
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
We don't want to be a...

562
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
Okay, that works.

563
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:05,760
Sure.

564
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,900
I put on my other outfit too.

565
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,320
The Temple of Doom outfit.

566
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,260
I realized I didn't have it on last stream either.

567
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,900
Wait, but my...

568
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,840
Okay, I guess we'll come back for it.

569
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:21,700
Hello?

570
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,080
Oh, here we go.

571
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,580
I'm climbing, I'm climbing, I'm climbing.

572
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,860
And swing.

573
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,480
Swing!

574
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:37,740
That works.

575
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,860
Where do you want me to go?

576
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,800
Maybe here.

577
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,840
Climb out.

578
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,220
No one can see me.

579
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,190
Okay, perfect.

580
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,330
So this guy...

581
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,070
No.

582
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,110
This guy...

583
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,430
That guy...

584
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,630
What?

585
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:04,490
Wait.

586
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,130
Oh, are we...

587
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:08,610
I guess I'm going to the other side.

588
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,530
I hope no one notices.

589
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,090
Do I not need to take a picture of that?

590
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,250
The confessions?

591
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,480
And push.

592
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,640
He needs to see the darkness.

593
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,900
Darkness.

594
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,600
Yeah, I just snapped his ankle.

595
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,540
Nice.

596
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,760
Did someone say the door to darkness?

597
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,580
What was the clue again?

598
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,840
What was the clue again?

599
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:04,960
Indy.

600
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,520
Indy, can you stop doing that?

601
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,040
This is...

602
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,700
This is his...

603
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,860
Sisyphus.

604
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,280
Hold on.

605
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,880
I can't undo this.

606
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,020
Oh, here we go.

607
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:24,260
Alright.

608
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,600
What's the clue?

609
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,060
Notes.

610
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,540
I think that was my birthday today.

611
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,220
Happy birthday, Mike!

612
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,760
Happy birthday to you.

613
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,840
Happy birthday to you.

614
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,720
Happy birthday, dear Mike.

615
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,660
Happy birthday to you.

616
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,840
App.

617
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,420
So someone said it in chat.

618
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:19,700
Someone said, light dragon must see the dark, shadow creature must see the light.

619
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,620
So this guy, he's kind of...

620
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,420
Well, he is...

621
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,280
He is...

622
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,080
He is in the light?

623
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,060
Shadow?

624
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,360
I mean, doesn't it depend on the day?

625
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,500
The time of day?

626
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,500
Okay, so you look at...

627
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,140
You look at the sun.

628
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,860
But that's exactly what he was doing before.

629
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,620
What's the point?

630
00:36:59,300 --> 00:36:59,820
Okay.

631
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,180
We'll leave you to it.

632
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,160
Gosh, I'm so glad nobody notices this.

633
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,340
Some guys swinging from the rafters.

634
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,480
Where's your foot, buddy?

635
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,420
Where's your foot?

636
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,220
Is it down here?

637
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,240
Do you guys see a foot?

638
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,520
No one ever looks up.

639
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,600
It's true.

640
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,920
Gamers never look up.

641
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,740
Do you guys see a foot?

642
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,040
Maybe...

643
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,260
We grab the dragon claw.

644
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,420
Oh my God!

645
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
Oh my God, I didn't recognize Gina.

646
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,610
He has a concussion now.

647
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,170
Gina...

648
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,130
Is this a hidden door, Dr. Jones?

649
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,830
Where's my hat?

650
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,830
Are you pursuing some forbidden secret, perhaps?

651
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,570
Look, Gina.

652
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,590
This has been swell.

653
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,910
And I hope you find your sister, but...

654
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,910
I work best on my own.

655
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,150
Where's my hat?

656
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,410
He's here.

657
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,490
He's here.

658
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,650
He's so distraught without it.

659
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,970
I'm working on it.

660
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,690
Oh my God, what's wrong with his armpit?

661
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,310
Yeah, I did.

662
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,150
A claw.

663
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,970
Can I climb from here?

664
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:03,110
I can.

665
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:07,430
What was the point of me going through all of this anyway?

666
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:10,210
Item limit has been reached.

667
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,810
If I could just get up from here, why did I go inside?

668
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:19,290
She doesn't care about me.

669
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,010
She's not even looking.

670
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,030
Where is she going?

671
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,550
Gina, what are you doing?

672
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,270
Gumdrop, welcome to Mambu Shop.

673
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,210
I believe you are the true GW.

674
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,850
How can we be sure you are not part of the selection for societal sanity?

675
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,090
That you are not a daughter of the Patriots.

676
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,970
You just have to trust me, bro.

677
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:48,810
Alright.

678
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,950
Okay, so that guy looks at the sun and you look behind.

679
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:57,990
You look in the shadows.

680
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,200
Maybe they look at each other?

681
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,020
I have to go all the way around.

682
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:57,380
I don't feel like the sun should have a play because the sun can be in different directions depending on the time of day, right?

683
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:06,720
Like it would be kind of silly if it were that...

684
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,520
Oh.

685
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,080
Well, now we are in here.

686
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,620
So cool.

687
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,720
Why is the music all spooky?

688
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:21,900
I'm scared.

689
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,640
It's okay.

690
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,040
We'll just grab this here.

691
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,900
Wait.

692
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:39,920
This bandage.

693
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:49,520
Oh there it is.

694
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:50,440
It just took a minute.

695
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,800
Alright.

696
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:03,580
Alright.

697
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:12,940
So you...look.

698
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,360
Look, he's looking at us.

699
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,200
Are you obsessed with us or something, other dragon?

700
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,340
Are you obsessed with this dragon?

701
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,660
Do you want to look at him all the time?

702
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,300
No, no, no.

703
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:29,260
No, no, no.

704
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,820
Keep going.

705
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,460
No, Indy don't pull it back.

706
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,080
Oh, now I learned he can pull it back.

707
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:49,790
And then we pull.

708
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,070
We don't want our knees to break again so we'll go this way.

709
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:00,450
And down.

710
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,310
And down.

711
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,970
And down.

712
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:08,750
Nice.

713
00:43:15,490 --> 00:43:16,890
Yikes!

714
00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:22,570
I can see that Dina!

715
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,730
I hope no one heard...

716
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,350
I hope no one heard that.

717
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:41,950
Wow, what an ugly baby.

718
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:45,990
Dina!

719
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:47,370
Wow, the fountain.

720
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,270
Fountain gate.

721
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:54,210
What else is in here?

722
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,610
Oh, is this a puzzle?

723
00:43:58,610 --> 00:43:58,690
Puzzle?

724
00:43:58,890 --> 00:43:59,630
Oh, ok.

725
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:04,850
Lord Farquaad.

726
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:09,410
Shut up!

727
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,130
I'm exploring!

728
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,290
I don't even know what you're talking about yet.

729
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,970
Ok, don't go back there.

730
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,490
Oh, that was the other dragon.

731
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:24,090
That's right.

732
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,490
Oh, and then...

733
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:26,230
Oh my goodness.

734
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,550
This is quite the contraption.

735
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,090
This looks like something I need to pull.

736
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:33,490
I need to yank that.

737
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,350
You're really yanking my chain.

738
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,070
Prime backseater out.

739
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:41,990
Shut up.

740
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,510
She really is just a backseater, isn't she?

741
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:46,590
What handles is she talking about?

742
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,310
What handles are... Handles?

743
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:53,390
What is she talking about?

744
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
Them love handles?

745
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:04,780
Paw?

746
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,930
I don't know what she's talking about.

747
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:13,270
What handles?

748
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,300
Look up?

749
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,160
No?

750
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,980
It said the handles appeared when the fountain turned.

751
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:28,820
Handles.

752
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,000
In front of her?

753
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,280
This guy.

754
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,000
Someone's talking.

755
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,600
Ok, it's turning again.

756
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,030
Nice jump.

757
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:02,370
She's got such skill.

758
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:07,470
Why does the game feel a little bit more goofy today?

759
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:11,050
Thank you so much for the five gifted.

760
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:17,030
Why does it feel like super goofy today?

761
00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:20,230
I don't...

762
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:24,870
She doesn't care.

763
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,410
She doesn't care.

764
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:29,950
The baptism.

765
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:30,130
Baptism.

766
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:38,150
I got an achievement for my baptism?

767
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:39,290
Oh shutterbug.

768
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,910
Captured 50 photographs.

769
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:41,590
Nice.

770
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,150
What's this now?

771
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,470
Go away!

772
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,030
Game pass.

773
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,770
X

774
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,270
What is she doing?

775
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:56,830
Gina?

776
00:46:58,630 --> 00:46:59,930
Gina, what are you doing girl?

777
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,410
Alright, what do you do here?

778
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:06,850
Ew, it looks like hair.

779
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,680
Oh, he's gonna baptize the guy!

780
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,480
Right?

781
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,660
You give him the water and then he goes...

782
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:21,820
Ok, hold on.

783
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,480
I think we need to redo it.

784
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:31,450
Ok.

785
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:41,330
Nasty sludge water that hasn't been touched in like a bajillion years.

786
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:42,190
Ok, keep going.

787
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:46,150
Alright, nice.

788
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:48,770
Baptize.

789
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,150
Baptized.

790
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,310
Ok,

791
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:09,250
now we probably have to do the other side.

792
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:13,770
Wow.

793
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,430
They even put him away.

794
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:21,730
Let's do the other side.

795
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,210
Alright, come here Gina.

796
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,330
Oh, I believe my cat mummy might be in there.

797
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,510
If it's in there, how did the other person get in there?

798
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:36,950
Did they do all of this?

799
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,850
And then lock it up again?

800
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:43,870
There she goes.

801
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,390
She's such a go-getter.

802
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:55,990
She looks like she's about to fall asleep.

803
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:02,210
That doesn't look like baby Moses.

804
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:04,750
Ok, what does baby Moses look like, huh?

805
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,870
Huh?

806
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:06,910
Tell you.

807
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,390
Did you know him personally?

808
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,530
I don't think so.

809
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:13,150
No.

810
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,530
I'm rando-nodding here, ok?

811
00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:24,750
Gosh.

812
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,530
Ok.

813
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:33,530
So we need to like...

814
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,530
turn this all...

815
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:37,590
so that he can get through.

816
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:40,490
Oh, those are wood planks.

817
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:42,830
Oh, I forgot to take a picture!

818
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:45,630
Whoops, sorry.

819
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,310
I tampered with the evidence.

820
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:49,230
Before I took a picture.

821
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,150
Get out of the picture, Gina!

822
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,450
Is that what that means?

823
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,780
I don't know what I'm supposed to do with the wood.

824
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,060
Is there another rotator?

825
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,120
Or is it just this?

826
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:26,980
Why is it sometimes the big wheel and sometimes the small wheel?

827
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,720
I can...

828
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,380
Wait!

829
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,320
Oh my gosh.

830
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:40,140
I'm so close.

831
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,500
Wait, I almost did it.

832
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,500
I think?

833
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,000
Yeah, there's just that wood right there.

834
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,260
Oh my god.

835
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:48,220
Ok, ok, ok.

836
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,700
See, like this.

837
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:57,600
Ok.

838
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,040
Keep going.

839
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,420
Did I do it or is that... Oh, that wood is still there.

840
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,260
Ok, hold on.

841
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,500
Just kidding!

842
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,780
Indy, you need to commit, ok?

843
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,780
How do I get this...

844
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:21,210
Edged?

845
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:22,150
No!

846
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,170
Alright, now go up.

847
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:24,730
Go up.

848
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:26,710
And get it here.

849
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:29,090
Yeah!

850
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:31,710
Alright, now sideways.

851
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,390
Now big, big, big circle.

852
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,850
Big circle time.

853
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,350
Yeah!

854
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:41,230
Oh wait!

855
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,590
Oh, it's still there.

856
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:48,780
Oh.

857
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,720
The great circle.

858
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,100
3, 2, 1, woo!

859
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,260
Or boo!

860
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,640
Yeah, boo!

861
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:00,740
Thank you!

862
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,180
The great circle.

863
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,640
We found the great circle.

864
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:23,990
How do I get it away?

865
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:24,330
Hey!

866
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:28,710
It's stuck in there.

867
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:37,190
I thought I was a genius and I figured out the puzzle.

868
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:41,390
Upside down T on the middle.

869
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,640
Let's see what happens.

870
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,300
Wait, what does this one do?

871
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:11,720
Oh,

872
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,960
can I just pick either one?

873
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:22,880
One sends him forward and one sends him back.

874
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,120
Wait, so can I make him go through?

875
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:31,840
Happy National Short Girl Day Mint Yugo Short Queen.

876
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,360
Thanks.

877
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:39,990
Alright, alright, alright.

878
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:41,710
Wait.

879
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:43,410
Now?

880
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:50,790
Wait.

881
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:55,130
I don't think that's where...

882
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,090
Wait.

883
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:58,990
Oh, no.

884
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:10,360
Ok, I'm going to send him through.

885
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,420
I'm going to send him through.

886
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:12,580
Right?

887
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,460
There he goes.

888
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,100
And then he gets stuck.

889
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,080
Yeah, yeah.

890
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,460
And then he's going to go whoopie doo, flippy flip.

891
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,120
Just kidding.

892
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,860
I can't move it while he's in there.

893
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,100
Or maybe, let me try the other layers.

894
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:37,610
Ok, nevermind.

895
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:41,490
Just kidding.

896
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:51,470
I think you had it at first but messed it up.

897
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:55,270
That might have been the case because I didn't know what I was doing.

898
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,290
I had it?

899
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:00,810
Wait, what do you mean I had it?

900
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:02,590
How did I have it?

901
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,650
Wait, hold on.

902
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,230
If I spin it once more...

903
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,150
Oh, no, no, no, no.

904
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:09,470
Big spin.

905
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:11,810
If I do a big spin once more...

906
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:14,470
This one.

907
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:17,850
Do I have to do them all?

908
00:55:18,490 --> 00:55:22,810
I thought I've been able to do them...

909
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:23,270
Hmm?

910
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,570
Oh, that's why...

911
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,970
Oh, that's why it would sometimes spin all together.

912
00:55:37,310 --> 00:55:38,430
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

913
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,510
I was like, why?

914
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:41,990
Isn't it supposed to all spin together?

915
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:44,890
What?

916
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:49,470
Ok,

917
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:09,480
ok, ok.

918
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,440
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

919
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,280
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

920
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,140
No, no, no.

921
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,060
Go back, go back, go back.

922
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,000
Wait, actually, no.

923
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,700
Wait, I need it.

924
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,980
I need it in that one over there.

925
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:34,680
Ok, hold on.

926
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,280
I have to re-spin it around.

927
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,320
I have to re-spin it around.

928
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:39,800
I'm trying!

929
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,020
Wait, how am I supposed to...

930
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,560
Ok, hold on.

931
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,300
I know where it needs to go!

932
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,380
Oh my god!

933
00:56:57,160 --> 00:56:58,200
My brain!

934
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,100
This is like the damn slide puzzles!

935
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,240
Ok, hold on.

936
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,960
How do I get it to...

937
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,680
Do outside first.

938
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:24,080
What do you mean do outside first?

939
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,280
I'm trying to do any bit.

940
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:27,320
Don't say bit!

941
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,440
I'm confused!

942
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:36,780
I'm confused.

943
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,560
Move the ship now.

944
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,220
No, I can't.

945
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,540
I have to move the ship.

946
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,480
Here, I'll prove it to you.

947
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:50,980
Unless it works.

948
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,960
That would be kind of cool.

949
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,960
But I think the ship has to go all the way to the end.

950
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:55,860
See?

951
00:57:56,060 --> 00:57:57,640
I can't move it now.

952
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,480
Oh, whoops.

953
00:58:00,540 --> 00:58:01,180
See?

954
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,080
I can't move it.

955
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:03,100
See?

956
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,340
You have to have it all go in one turn.

957
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:16,090
I thought the ship pushed the wood.

958
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:16,670
No.

959
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:18,930
No.

960
00:58:19,610 --> 00:58:20,170
Ok, hold on.

961
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,870
So upside down T.

962
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,950
T.

963
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,200
Hold on.

964
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,280
I'm getting lost in the saws.

965
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:14,500
Wait.

966
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,580
Ok, hold on.

967
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,680
I'm just looking.

968
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,160
No, no, no.

969
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,760
Up in the...

970
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,680
Up in the...

971
00:59:37,930 --> 00:59:40,170
I did it!

972
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:48,180
There he goes all the way!

973
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:50,460
First try!

974
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:00,720
I'll go with you.

975
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,200
Oh yeah, we did it.

976
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,570
There he goes.

977
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,410
There we go.

978
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,800
It won't let me punch her.

979
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,220
It won't let me punch her if I get too close.

980
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,720
Alright, now I push the baby.

981
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:37,580
Push the baby!

982
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,280
Yippee!

983
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,000
First try!

984
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:41,900
First try!

985
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,760
Push the baby.

986
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,840
Push the baby.

987
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:49,380
Nice!

988
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,900
There we go.

989
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:05,460
Nice.

990
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:09,520
Why are these lit?

991
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,460
Gina, Gina, I have concerns.

992
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,120
Gina, I...

993
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,000
Gina, I have concerns.

994
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,720
She's gonna touch something.

995
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:22,740
Why are these lit?

996
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:36,530
Voss.

997
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:37,730
Emmerich.

998
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,490
Wow, look at the fire down there.

999
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:43,870
That's kind of awesome.

1000
01:01:45,090 --> 01:01:46,630
Emmerich balls.

1001
01:01:48,470 --> 01:01:49,890
Alright, finally.

1002
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:50,970
Anyway.

1003
01:01:55,150 --> 01:02:00,390
Oh, I guess it's safe to walk on this.

1004
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,770
Fountain underground map.

1005
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,690
Ok, here we go.

1006
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,410
Pull the lever!

1007
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:14,670
Watch out!

1008
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:15,110
Gina!

1009
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:28,350
Gina, watch out please!

1010
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,230
Oh my God.

1011
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:30,810
Whoops, sorry.

1012
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,890
Oh my God.

1013
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:46,430
That's what she almost just did.

1014
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:49,670
Oh no, our fortune and glory.

1015
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,770
Oh, she's getting a little sauna bath.

1016
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,450
Ok.

1017
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:56,330
Look at her little sauna and everything.

1018
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:56,630
Ok.

1019
01:02:57,030 --> 01:02:58,070
Careful, Gina.

1020
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:04,790
Does this look like there's a trap that's about to happen?

1021
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,370
Does any of these floors look like...

1022
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:12,670
If you step on them wrong, they'll activate something.

1023
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:17,870
We're going carefully.

1024
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:19,550
I don't want to perish in flames.

1025
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:33,910
What do you mean what am I doing?

1026
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:39,950
Well, what is she going to do?

1027
01:03:42,090 --> 01:03:42,610
Ok.

1028
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:48,730
Can I take that?

1029
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:49,170
No.

1030
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,790
It's getting mighty dark.

1031
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:54,510
Chamber of tribulations?

1032
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:01,090
Oh my God.

1033
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,670
What is this?

1034
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:07,890
It looks a little...

1035
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,210
Oh no, there's more platforming, you guys.

1036
01:04:10,790 --> 01:04:13,590
I hate to say this, but...

1037
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,230
What is this?

1038
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:20,190
Who made all of this?

1039
01:04:24,490 --> 01:04:25,870
How do I get up there?

1040
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:30,730
Gina, can you give me a hand?

1041
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,150
Also the water... Oh, just kidding.

1042
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,370
The water is really gross.

1043
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,290
Oh wow, that's such a cool effect.

1044
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:41,070
Wow, it's like real oil.

1045
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:43,910
When you walk through it.

1046
01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:45,090
Oh wow, it's...

1047
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,950
Oh, that's gross.

1048
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,420
Oh, but it's so...

1049
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,040
That's such a cool touch.

1050
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,380
It's also probably flammable.

1051
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,140
Yeah, I guess so.

1052
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:08,180
I'm trying to figure out how to get up.

1053
01:05:09,380 --> 01:05:10,980
Can you give me a hand, Gina?

1054
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,800
Oh, I figured it out.

1055
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,000
This seems like some kind of test.

1056
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:31,880
Oh, that one got stuck, so it's okay.

1057
01:05:33,660 --> 01:05:35,800
This seems very...

1058
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:39,320
Um, wow.

1059
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,860
What, so I just jump through?

1060
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,860
Oh god.

1061
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,180
Is this supposed to be broken?

1062
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,300
Oh my god.

1063
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:15,230
Moment of respect for the poor engineer under NDA in the Vatican whose job is to maintain all the swinging saws.

1064
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,830
That's what I'm saying.

1065
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:18,090
Why is that one stuck?

1066
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:21,230
I mean, I'm not gonna complain, but...

1067
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:26,110
I'm okay.

1068
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,790
Gina, when are you gonna try, huh?

1069
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:43,160
Okay, you don't run and jump, guys.

1070
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,720
You won't... It's overkill, apparently.

1071
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,160
I tried running and jumping.

1072
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,960
Apparently that's overkill.

1073
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:56,000
Jump!

1074
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,430
Jump!

1075
01:07:04,930 --> 01:07:06,890
You think I can make it there?

1076
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,790
Or do you think I have to go through here?

1077
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,070
I can't tell.

1078
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:16,030
Jump for the beef.

1079
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:17,890
No go right?

1080
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:18,210
Okay.

1081
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:26,250
Oh, I made it.

1082
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:33,070
Oh my god, she's trying.

1083
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:34,730
What?

1084
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,860
She's like, haha, idiot, you went the hard way.

1085
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:41,880
Wait, what?

1086
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:43,340
Gina, get out of my way.

1087
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:55,040
I'm trying!

1088
01:07:57,220 --> 01:07:58,100
Gina, are you okay?

1089
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,720
Did you get clipped?

1090
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,520
Uh oh, I think she's about to die.

1091
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:08,940
Alright, your turn.

1092
01:08:19,390 --> 01:08:21,530
She shimmied her way over here.

1093
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:27,830
Where were the flames part of that?

1094
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:33,770
Wow, that door!

1095
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:42,730
Wow, we have a lot of points.

1096
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:43,430
I just noticed.

1097
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:45,550
Maybe we should buy some stuff.

1098
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:49,170
We have all this.

1099
01:08:49,490 --> 01:08:50,010
Fitness.

1100
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:52,850
Climbing Ace.

1101
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:53,330
You know what?

1102
01:08:53,410 --> 01:08:54,330
I'll grab it.

1103
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,730
Uh, enemy, or Indy can clinch enemies for longer.

1104
01:09:00,830 --> 01:09:02,570
I don't really use, I don't really do that.

1105
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:03,350
Fruit bag!

1106
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:04,190
Unlock.

1107
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:07,150
We need more fruit.

1108
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:09,410
Combat was, oh.

1109
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:12,970
Thanks bookworm.

1110
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:14,850
Ten abilities from adventure books.

1111
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,450
Last hit before you provided, uh, yeah.

1112
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:18,790
Exploration.

1113
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:21,010
That's good for now, I think.

1114
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,630
Wow, this looks...

1115
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:32,430
Do you think we're gonna fight a dragon?

1116
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:35,330
There's a door?

1117
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:36,190
Question mark?

1118
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:36,850
Maybe not.

1119
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,410
This looks kind of well maintained, all things considered.

1120
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,370
I'm looking at it.

1121
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:44,510
This craziness.

1122
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:48,590
This looks like that one famous gate.

1123
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,050
It's a nice gate.

1124
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:02,720
That one gate.

1125
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:03,640
Yeah.

1126
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,240
That one door.

1127
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,780
Looks like a door.

1128
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,720
Nothing around, nothing here to explore either.

1129
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:11,600
No bread?

1130
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,500
No leftover giant bread?

1131
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:18,970
Oh, what's this?

1132
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,450
Alright.

1133
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:27,530
Creepy!

1134
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,930
What am I taking a picture of?

1135
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:29,270
You?

1136
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:31,970
You?

1137
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:32,430
Oh!

1138
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:34,390
Courtyard plaque.

1139
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,070
How could you read that from all the way over here?

1140
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:47,750
Complete the challenges.

1141
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:51,070
That's all it says.

1142
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:58,160
What kind of challenges are we talking about, Dr. Jones?

1143
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,180
OK, so this is when you do the molten and make the key.

1144
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:04,440
And then what's in here?

1145
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,360
Another room?

1146
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:06,960
OK.

1147
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:08,380
Fascinating.

1148
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,240
And these guys...

1149
01:11:11,940 --> 01:11:13,960
Their masks are so scary!

1150
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,380
They look like they're supposed to be holding something.

1151
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:26,760
Lava, death traps, guardian statues, ominous door, all under the Vatican?

1152
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,720
You are actually trying to break into hell?

1153
01:11:29,220 --> 01:11:29,700
Maybe.

1154
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:31,920
Alright.

1155
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,080
Time to pull!

1156
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:36,880
Hello?

1157
01:11:47,930 --> 01:11:48,490
Dr.

1158
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:53,030
Jones.

1159
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:55,150
I missed short round.

1160
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:57,030
Oh god, the game just saved.

1161
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:05,440
There's an awful lot of dead guys in here.

1162
01:12:07,780 --> 01:12:09,380
That's a great question.

1163
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,520
Oh my god, look how red it is.

1164
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:21,540
Red means scary guys.

1165
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:24,320
What is this?

1166
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:38,110
What does it say?

1167
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:44,910
Wait, what?

1168
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,390
Wait, can you hear it?

1169
01:12:50,450 --> 01:12:50,990
What did it say?

1170
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:56,330
It's Latin for with.

1171
01:12:58,030 --> 01:12:59,330
I know it's a real word.

1172
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:04,150
Isn't that a sorority or fraternity thing, right?

1173
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:05,970
Oh my god!

1174
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:11,170
Ok Gina, I'm trying to be careful around these parts, but you're just literally running through.

1175
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,130
That's fine.

1176
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,290
The music is so ominous.

1177
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,170
It's kind of awesome.

1178
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,030
It's a little... It's the gnome.

1179
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:30,470
It's the gnome.

1180
01:13:30,670 --> 01:13:32,450
Wait, there's like some...

1181
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:33,430
Oh, what's this?

1182
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:38,130
Big line, short line, three dot line, three dot line.

1183
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:40,190
Horizontal line.

1184
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,540
Ok, dead man.

1185
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,800
Is this loss?

1186
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,640
Might be.

1187
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:03,520
What's this?

1188
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,260
Stone tablet.

1189
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,280
Maybe.

1190
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:19,960
What do I do with... Ok, let's take this back to over here.

1191
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:23,620
To you.

1192
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:31,120
Oh!

1193
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,080
I'm trapped here!

1194
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,500
I will?

1195
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,360
Oh my god.

1196
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:45,840
Ok.

1197
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,500
Do I have to... Oh my god.

1198
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,580
I'm thinking!

1199
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:57,860
I'm thinking!

1200
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,740
Ok, I'm gonna run.

1201
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:02,860
I'm just gonna run for it.

1202
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:08,220
I grabbed another...

1203
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:11,000
Ok.

1204
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,840
Good thing she's here.

1205
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,400
Ok, ok, ok.

1206
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:25,180
Good, good, good.

1207
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:31,210
Nevermind.

1208
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:32,930
Not good, good, good, good, good.

1209
01:15:33,390 --> 01:15:34,410
Not good, good, good.

1210
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:36,350
Run Indy, run!

1211
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,750
Oh my god.

1212
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,670
I almost died, Gina.

1213
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,650
Gina, it's getting real hot in here, Gina.

1214
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:47,250
Can I use this one?

1215
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,510
Yeah, you think?

1216
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:54,090
Gimme,

1217
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:58,350
gimme, gimme.

1218
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,130
Thank you.

1219
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:02,930
Gimme.

1220
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:03,990
And in.

1221
01:16:04,910 --> 01:16:05,850
And goodbye fire.

1222
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:07,290
Oh no!

1223
01:16:08,150 --> 01:16:08,410
Oh!

1224
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:09,630
Bigger fire!

1225
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:10,930
Wait, bigger fire!

1226
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:15,510
Ok!

1227
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:17,030
Go, go, go!

1228
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:23,620
Fire

1229
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:28,760
will disappear.

1230
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:29,720
Oh my goodness.

1231
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:30,800
I'm in again!

1232
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:32,240
Thank you so much for the Akasupa!

1233
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:34,460
I got robbed on my birthday?

1234
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,080
I missed your stream that day.

1235
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:38,440
Wait, not literally robbed.

1236
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,460
Just dropping in to say thank you for being you and Mary Kremis.

1237
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:44,560
Not actually robbed.

1238
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:47,460
Cinderathalos, thanks for the 10 gifted.

1239
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,120
I hope you're ok.

1240
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,760
If you got robbed, don't send me a superchat.

1241
01:16:55,860 --> 01:16:56,860
Especially not an Akasupa.

1242
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,360
But of course we'll give you a happy birthday song!

1243
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:03,800
Happy birthday to you!

1244
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:06,400
I hope you're ok!

1245
01:17:07,180 --> 01:17:09,800
I wish you a merry birthday!

1246
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:12,920
Actually, but it's fine now.

1247
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,960
Happy birthday, birthday kid!

1248
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:25,000
What do you mean it's fine now?

1249
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,040
It happened at all so it's not fine at all.

1250
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,980
Is this the thing blacksmiths work in?

1251
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:48,360
I don't know what we're...

1252
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,760
Indy, you are really strong buddy!

1253
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:54,680
Holy moly!

1254
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:55,940
Ok Gina, watch out, ok?

1255
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,160
Trying to push me into the fires.

1256
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:09,710
This is so cool!

1257
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,330
This place rules, right?

1258
01:18:12,830 --> 01:18:13,810
This is so awesome!

1259
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:17,990
Ok, next trial.

1260
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,170
Look at that!

1261
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,510
We made the first key!

1262
01:18:25,370 --> 01:18:26,530
I saw!

1263
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:29,390
Do

1264
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:37,820
I do this?

1265
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:50,880
What is she trying to say?

1266
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,340
Yes?

1267
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,060
What do you mean yes?

1268
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,060
Vatican in 1937.

1269
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,420
Secret underground death traps.

1270
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:06,340
Vatican in 2024.

1271
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:10,200
Cue anime girl mascots.

1272
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:12,560
That's...

1273
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:15,880
It's the same thing.

1274
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,360
Who do you think is guarding the secret underground death traps now?

1275
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:22,600
Huh?

1276
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,200
Who do you think is guarding it now?

1277
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,820
It's a whole ass keyblade.

1278
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,520
You're right!

1279
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:29,720
Actually.

1280
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:32,300
Nice.

1281
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,200
It really is a keyblade.

1282
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,240
Do you know anything girl?

1283
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,560
Ok, time to do...

1284
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,040
The second challenge.

1285
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:52,240
This one.

1286
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:54,780
Pull!

1287
01:19:56,920 --> 01:19:58,700
Alex, thank you so much for 8 months.

1288
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,880
She's trying her best.

1289
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:03,560
You know what?

1290
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:04,460
She knows more than me.

1291
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,620
But her comments are very unnecessary I would say.

1292
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,740
Like yeah Gina, we know.

1293
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:15,900
We know it moved.

1294
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:17,040
That's why I pulled the lever.

1295
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:18,360
That's why I did that.

1296
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:25,280
Are those swords?

1297
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:28,120
What are these?

1298
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:32,960
It looks like it was part of a trial and they were flailing around.

1299
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,220
Ok Vatican construction team.

1300
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:41,040
We are creating death traps.

1301
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,120
Alright, person number 1.

1302
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,800
What is your suggested death trap?

1303
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:54,980
I propose we have swinging axes from the ceiling that you must parkour to and from.

1304
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:56,840
Great suggestion.

1305
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:00,820
It is a test of one's agility.

1306
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,920
Ok, person number 2.

1307
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,900
What do you think should be our proposed death trap?

1308
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:13,840
I think we should have a room full of fire that you must traverse through to prove your purity.

1309
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:17,680
And then you stick in some stone blocks.

1310
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:19,600
I like it.

1311
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:24,780
It exemplifies someone's dexterity.

1312
01:21:25,780 --> 01:21:26,400
Third person.

1313
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,020
What do you think should be the Vatican's death trap?

1314
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:39,320
Yeah, I just think we should have a bunch of swords on chains and they flail around.

1315
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:50,160
Imagine you go into a room and there are just swords on chains all over the place.

1316
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:57,330
What do these do?

1317
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,830
I can't.

1318
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:06,850
As God intended.

1319
01:22:07,610 --> 01:22:08,090
Amen.

1320
01:22:09,490 --> 01:22:11,230
So glad we don't have to go through these.

1321
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:16,890
Guy created the most elaborate death trap of them all.

1322
01:22:16,970 --> 01:22:17,430
What's this?

1323
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:19,690
I thought those were monkeys.

1324
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:23,470
What's in here?

1325
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,320
Gina, don't follow me.

1326
01:22:33,940 --> 01:22:35,620
Thank you.

1327
01:22:38,140 --> 01:22:38,580
Place.

1328
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:44,680
Oh, I'm sequence breaking.

1329
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,980
I'm sequence breaking, my bad.

1330
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:51,120
Okay.

1331
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,440
What is your favorite death trap, Minto?

1332
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:05,740
She's really intrigued by this stone wall.

1333
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,000
Okay, don't roll your eyes at me, Gina.

1334
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:10,940
Oh, a secret!

1335
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:12,440
Oh my God.

1336
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:16,660
We got the sussy relic.

1337
01:23:17,620 --> 01:23:20,240
Enemy girls guard ancient relics now.

1338
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:23,020
Minto is sitting in a room full of G-Stuffs.

1339
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:33,260
What are you doing in here?

1340
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,420
What are you looking at?

1341
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:37,500
Alright, onward!

1342
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,220
Maybe I wasn't sequence breaking.

1343
01:23:56,060 --> 01:23:59,340
She is too comfortable with walking on top of this stuff.

1344
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,740
She is way too...too comfortable.

1345
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:05,760
Wow!

1346
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:07,140
Go, Gia!

1347
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:12,640
Here?

1348
01:24:17,930 --> 01:24:19,510
Is there something I need to pull?

1349
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:21,950
The light guide my path.

1350
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:25,250
Gold path trial.

1351
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:33,790
Where is she going?

1352
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:38,690
Do I follow her?

1353
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:40,750
Okay, I'm following her.

1354
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:42,750
Oh, just kidding.

1355
01:24:44,510 --> 01:24:48,090
The light guide your...oh, maybe I go pull the thing.

1356
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,510
Alright.

1357
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,250
They are so creepy!

1358
01:24:59,250 --> 01:25:01,750
The lighting is so awesome.

1359
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:18,040
Where did she go?

1360
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,280
Okay.

1361
01:25:21,620 --> 01:25:23,240
What's this?

1362
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:47,000
The holy grail?

1363
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:51,400
I think that would have to be the Henya cup.

1364
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,940
I can't just not...

1365
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:05,380
I would do anything to have just a dribble of anything out of my Kamiyoshi cup.

1366
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:08,660
Okay, hold on.

1367
01:26:08,780 --> 01:26:09,500
I'm confused.

1368
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,660
Okay, let the light guide your path.

1369
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:15,260
But...

1370
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,900
Do I have to make them...

1371
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:21,840
light up?

1372
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,940
But they don't...

1373
01:26:25,980 --> 01:26:27,180
I'm confused.

1374
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,940
If I could just...a little bit from, you know...

1375
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,880
The cup of my Kamiyoshi.

1376
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:40,420
Okay.

1377
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,320
Oh, we can't go through here, can we?

1378
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:46,780
Okay, only this side.

1379
01:26:47,540 --> 01:26:50,740
I don't understand if it's supposed to look a certain way, you know.

1380
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:58,880
Okay, this one doesn't have a thing, so...

1381
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:00,240
It's correct?

1382
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:05,500
How am I supposed to know what's the right one?

1383
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:12,400
Pull the lever and see how it looks behind?

1384
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,280
I get hurt?

1385
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,040
I could try really fast.

1386
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:16,880
I think...

1387
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,700
Get away from there!

1388
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:21,900
Nothing changes.

1389
01:27:28,040 --> 01:27:30,560
They light up, but this one is not lit up.

1390
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:32,880
And I can't move it.

1391
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,040
So it must be like the quote on quote example, right?

1392
01:27:50,860 --> 01:27:51,340
Okay.

1393
01:27:55,820 --> 01:27:57,600
Okay, it does light up.

1394
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:58,900
Nevermind.

1395
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,680
I can't move the other window.

1396
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:06,940
Nice, okay.

1397
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:09,380
And...

1398
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:10,920
This one I also can't move.

1399
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,180
Maybe...

1400
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:16,420
The other door opened.

1401
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,560
Or it didn't do that.

1402
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,420
I hope you have a good holiday with the Mintoes.

1403
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:28,080
Snake surfing!

1404
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:33,500
If you were to choose between Snake's cake and Jetstream Sam's cake, which would you choose?

1405
01:28:34,240 --> 01:28:35,480
That's a great question.

1406
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,240
Look up?

1407
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:41,100
Cameras don't look up?

1408
01:28:44,230 --> 01:28:45,430
Let the whip work.

1409
01:28:45,790 --> 01:28:46,690
There's like nothing here.

1410
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:50,010
There's not even a little guy.

1411
01:28:50,250 --> 01:28:51,270
That's a great question.

1412
01:28:52,150 --> 01:28:53,790
I think between the two...

1413
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:58,110
I really like Sam.

1414
01:29:02,990 --> 01:29:04,230
How do I go up there?

1415
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:06,870
How do I get up there?

1416
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:14,360
I have to say these sounds are...

1417
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:15,680
Wait.

1418
01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:18,340
These sounds seem pretty demonic.

1419
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:22,360
Yeah,

1420
01:29:25,680 --> 01:29:29,260
of course I have to whip it you guys, but I have to like...

1421
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,260
It's not like I just whip it good.

1422
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,140
Whip it good.

1423
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:37,260
I have to like...

1424
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,020
You have to also...

1425
01:29:41,020 --> 01:29:42,300
I can't go down.

1426
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,380
You have to also have the ability to do it.

1427
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,000
OK, go down Indy.

1428
01:29:48,520 --> 01:29:49,300
Indy, go down.

1429
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:50,720
Indy, go down.

1430
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,360
Indy, go down.

1431
01:29:55,420 --> 01:29:56,040
Oh, there we go.

1432
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,120
Maybe... Can I swing over there?

1433
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:00,400
Is it too far?

1434
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:02,700
Oh god.

1435
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:04,200
I think it's too far.

1436
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,380
The fur... Left?

1437
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,040
Is there an... Oh!

1438
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,360
Can I swing to that?

1439
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,320
Ouch.

1440
01:30:25,740 --> 01:30:27,820
I don't... Can I grab onto that?

1441
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,720
I don't think I can.

1442
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:29,660
OK, hold on.

1443
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,660
Is there anything else that I can...

1444
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:41,160
How do I get from all the way over here to there?

1445
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,480
OK, hold on.

1446
01:30:54,220 --> 01:30:55,840
I can absolutely grab onto it.

1447
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,360
Onto that?

1448
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:56,880
OK.

1449
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,440
OK, let me try again.

1450
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:05,300
Let me go... OK.

1451
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,120
Oh!

1452
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:22,730
Got it perfectly!

1453
01:31:23,810 --> 01:31:24,410
OK.

1454
01:31:28,050 --> 01:31:28,950
Climb it up baby.

1455
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:30,230
Nice!

1456
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:35,590
You are going to return it to where it was, right Gina?

1457
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:37,830
I had it perfectly placed.

1458
01:31:40,190 --> 01:31:41,070
That's right.

1459
01:31:42,150 --> 01:31:44,210
You really are the divine comedy.

1460
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:45,850
What did I... What did I do?

1461
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:48,430
Through!

1462
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,190
Nice.

1463
01:31:50,590 --> 01:31:51,050
OK.

1464
01:31:54,130 --> 01:31:55,050
Easy.

1465
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,390
I think I'm the best at this.

1466
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:06,220
Nice.

1467
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:07,980
Easy.

1468
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:10,540
Everything is lit up.

1469
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:19,700
You are really yanking my chain.

1470
01:32:20,360 --> 01:32:22,280
You are really pulling my chain.

1471
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:22,640
OK.

1472
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:24,520
Oh my God.

1473
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,260
Gina, are you good?

1474
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:27,160
Are you OK?

1475
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:29,380
I think this should be it.

1476
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,280
Let's pull the lever!

1477
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:39,730
Yeah, I actually did it.

1478
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,570
And here we are.

1479
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:46,710
Oh, let me take my photo.

1480
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:49,330
That's a gun.

1481
01:32:51,570 --> 01:32:52,010
Wait.

1482
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:53,370
Camera.

1483
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:56,270
Camera.

1484
01:32:56,810 --> 01:32:57,250
Camera.

1485
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:57,750
Camera.

1486
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,470
You think she is going to betray me guys?

1487
01:33:04,510 --> 01:33:05,590
You think she is going to betray me?

1488
01:33:06,190 --> 01:33:07,770
Hope you are doing good and have a nice holiday.

1489
01:33:08,010 --> 01:33:08,830
Thank you!

1490
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,130
You too Toa!

1491
01:33:10,450 --> 01:33:11,310
Thank you so much.

1492
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:20,030
You think these are going to turn around?

1493
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,550
Be super freaky?

1494
01:33:26,010 --> 01:33:26,970
Their mouths!

1495
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:29,870
They are not freaky!

1496
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:31,230
They are metal as hell!

1497
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:35,650
Oh my God!

1498
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:36,870
Gina, get out.

1499
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:37,870
You are ruining the view.

1500
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:44,570
Does she seem like the type who will betray you?

1501
01:33:44,570 --> 01:33:46,930
Honestly, she doesn't really give that kind of vibe.

1502
01:33:47,510 --> 01:33:47,970
But you know.

1503
01:33:48,390 --> 01:33:49,270
You never know.

1504
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,950
Perfect.

1505
01:33:57,200 --> 01:34:03,320
So I like how all of these just kind of hope and assume that you have a whip to be able to...

1506
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,000
Because how are you supposed to get that otherwise?

1507
01:34:10,020 --> 01:34:15,600
Oh, for giants.

1508
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:17,420
You are right.

1509
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:20,860
You are right.

1510
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:22,500
It's tall for the giants.

1511
01:34:23,860 --> 01:34:26,140
These guys are also like...

1512
01:34:27,820 --> 01:34:28,440
Kingdom!

1513
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:31,760
It's even the door to darkness.

1514
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:39,410
I don't think every female character betrays Indy.

1515
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:50,470
Okay.

1516
01:34:50,470 --> 01:34:51,210
Search for clues.

1517
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:52,450
Okay.

1518
01:34:59,570 --> 01:35:02,130
You don't want to take a picture of this?

1519
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:05,830
I'm scared.

1520
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:14,670
Lights?

1521
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:18,530
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1522
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:20,830
I'm a little freaked out.

1523
01:35:24,950 --> 01:35:25,650
Metatron.

1524
01:35:36,450 --> 01:35:39,170
You guys, I think this might be Kingdom Hearts.

1525
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:45,410
This

1526
01:35:48,790 --> 01:35:50,630
is so awesome looking.

1527
01:36:01,390 --> 01:36:03,030
Nice rear.

1528
01:36:05,570 --> 01:36:07,430
What is she doing?

1529
01:36:09,970 --> 01:36:10,930
What is she doing?

1530
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:17,840
Okay, we are just wandering around.

1531
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,680
Oh, there is a door over here.

1532
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:25,040
Why is it saving?

1533
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:25,720
I'm scared.

1534
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,840
Where the hell did you come from?

1535
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:39,770
Millage.

1536
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:50,760
What?

1537
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:51,740
What did you hear?

1538
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:53,260
I didn't hear anything.

1539
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,260
History of the Crusades.

1540
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,900
An old book concerning the history of the Crusades written sometime in medieval times.

1541
01:37:00,760 --> 01:37:02,220
Sometime in medieval times.

1542
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:06,840
It's full title is History of the Crusades and the Sacred Vessels of the Great Reclamation.

1543
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:10,840
We don't want that.

1544
01:37:10,980 --> 01:37:12,360
You don't want to take that Indy.

1545
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,400
It's not important enough to you.

1546
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:20,120
Wow, it's got the little... it's got loss on it.

1547
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:24,700
Me anytime I see a vaguely circular set piece of paper.

1548
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:26,540
This is the great circle.

1549
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:28,000
Oh yeah!

1550
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:30,500
I keep forgetting about the circle.

1551
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,480
Imagine this is morning view.

1552
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:37,660
Very old bible that cannot be found in the historic records of the different versions of the sacred text.

1553
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:39,640
Yeah, who's here?

1554
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,420
And they left bread.

1555
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,150
Am I going to eat the bread?

1556
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,000
Hell yeah I am.

1557
01:37:59,860 --> 01:38:01,360
I'm just going to take their bread.

1558
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,780
Yeah, could be really old bread.

1559
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:05,200
Who knows?

1560
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:05,600
Who cares?

1561
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,900
Why is this painting so large?

1562
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:13,640
So randomly placed.

1563
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:14,620
Oh, what's this?

1564
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:15,360
Paper?

1565
01:38:16,780 --> 01:38:18,380
What are these writings?

1566
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:21,660
Burnt paper with symbols of unknown origin.

1567
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:24,800
Okay.

1568
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:29,560
Oh, I found something important.

1569
01:38:34,820 --> 01:38:36,920
Do you know it?

1570
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,480
Wow.

1571
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:45,580
Oh my god.

1572
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:49,180
That looks like the most complicated language ever.

1573
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:56,200
My dad.

1574
01:38:58,740 --> 01:38:58,980
Oh!

1575
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,680
Your sister.

1576
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,710
That looks so complicated.

1577
01:39:10,110 --> 01:39:10,870
Oh my god.

1578
01:39:13,870 --> 01:39:18,650
This curious book contains unusual prayers not seen in any traditional religious sources.

1579
01:39:19,850 --> 01:39:20,390
How curious.

1580
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:21,190
What's this?

1581
01:39:21,370 --> 01:39:23,730
This looks like regular writing.

1582
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:25,250
Locus.

1583
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:32,710
Traveled to the new world and located the word in a school.

1584
01:39:33,730 --> 01:39:35,310
Oh, the paper looks so modern.

1585
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:37,390
I thought that it was like the people that were here.

1586
01:39:37,410 --> 01:39:40,050
Brother Locus received minimal injuries during retrieval.

1587
01:39:40,710 --> 01:39:41,870
I don't know about minimal.

1588
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:49,110
It appears in the form of a cat and has been placed in the treasury of esoteric artifacts.

1589
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:53,110
We have to find this treasury, Gina.

1590
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:57,130
Maybe there are some clues in here.

1591
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:01,810
That's what I said.

1592
01:40:03,870 --> 01:40:04,930
Just punch him.

1593
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:05,870
Punch it in.

1594
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:08,770
Set it aflame.

1595
01:40:11,250 --> 01:40:12,130
Do something.

1596
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:12,570
I don't know.

1597
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:14,130
Weren't you supposed to watch guard?

1598
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,210
Keep guard, girl.

1599
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:21,670
Nephilim.

1600
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:23,490
Nephilim.

1601
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:36,950
Like Iris?

1602
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:39,630
She's a giant?

1603
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:42,850
Iris.

1604
01:40:43,130 --> 01:40:44,110
It's Iris.

1605
01:40:44,110 --> 01:40:44,330
Iris.

1606
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:51,670
I forgot she was a Nephilim.

1607
01:40:59,530 --> 01:41:00,590
Vatican's secrets.

1608
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:03,930
What?

1609
01:41:11,170 --> 01:41:14,250
How did you open that?

1610
01:41:16,150 --> 01:41:17,030
You got this, Gina.

1611
01:41:17,730 --> 01:41:18,730
You got this.

1612
01:41:20,490 --> 01:41:21,630
You got this, Gina.

1613
01:41:42,740 --> 01:41:43,220
Gina,

1614
01:41:50,990 --> 01:41:51,630
I'm so sorry.

1615
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:54,890
Can you help me out?

1616
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:00,070
Oh no!

1617
01:42:01,490 --> 01:42:02,110
Get in!

1618
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:04,170
Wait, what do you mean someone's coming?

1619
01:42:04,270 --> 01:42:05,850
I didn't get to investigate the other area.

1620
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,090
My British guard.

1621
01:42:19,610 --> 01:42:20,990
It was the rat.

1622
01:42:21,710 --> 01:42:24,270
This is definitely a door.

1623
01:42:31,090 --> 01:42:31,390
No.

1624
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:36,450
What do we need to push?

1625
01:42:44,540 --> 01:42:46,120
Opportunity dogs, Vito.

1626
01:42:49,860 --> 01:42:51,460
What is that?

1627
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:52,000
Oh whoops.

1628
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:53,520
Oh here it is.

1629
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:56,380
Swipe?

1630
01:42:58,940 --> 01:43:04,860
You had a great time.

1631
01:43:09,150 --> 01:43:10,940
I still have the pendant.

1632
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:14,740
That's the wrong thing.

1633
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:15,120
Turn!

1634
01:43:18,900 --> 01:43:19,880
The treasury!

1635
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:23,380
Maybe?

1636
01:43:24,040 --> 01:43:25,900
Looks pretty...

1637
01:43:32,600 --> 01:43:33,940
Jackpot baby!

1638
01:43:36,020 --> 01:43:40,120
I just realized I can look around during the cutscenes.

1639
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,360
What are you looking at?

1640
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,760
I don't know.

1641
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:50,460
We literally just heard somebody walking.

1642
01:43:54,480 --> 01:43:56,020
Oh she's gonna betray us.

1643
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:00,840
Oh she's gonna betray us.

1644
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:02,720
Oh she's gonna betray us.

1645
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:06,140
Oh she's gonna betray us.

1646
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,800
Gina, is it because I...

1647
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,380
Is it because I whiffed too hard?

1648
01:44:13,160 --> 01:44:13,680
Wow.

1649
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,160
Look at that.

1650
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:16,560
Shut up.

1651
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:16,860
Hold on.

1652
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:17,520
I'm exploring.

1653
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:21,740
She's gearing up for betrayal.

1654
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:24,040
That's the most sus thing I've seen her do.

1655
01:44:24,180 --> 01:44:24,820
What is this?

1656
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:25,740
A knot mirror.

1657
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:28,620
Maybe I'm a vampire.

1658
01:44:31,740 --> 01:44:33,080
I'm looking around.

1659
01:44:33,260 --> 01:44:34,260
Treasure chamber.

1660
01:44:36,240 --> 01:44:36,640
Yeah.

1661
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,040
Wow!

1662
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:37,480
Wow!

1663
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:48,060
Oh my gosh, they even just have some shells.

1664
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:55,060
Well...

1665
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:57,040
Aren't you just saying...

1666
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,840
That the thing I wanted is over there?

1667
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:10,480
Oh my gosh, this is so awesome!

1668
01:45:12,820 --> 01:45:15,040
It feels like Chiara's outfit.

1669
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,860
Is that a gnome?

1670
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:19,920
I want this rat.

1671
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:23,400
Hello Gina.

1672
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:25,520
Betrayer.

1673
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:28,300
Gosh, she's like...

1674
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:30,060
These guys stink.

1675
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,880
Oh wow, there's even paintings on the wall.

1676
01:45:35,860 --> 01:45:37,000
What's this one?

1677
01:45:40,740 --> 01:45:41,620
Titty lion.

1678
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:47,200
I'm liking all the stuff that I'm seeing.

1679
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:54,220
There's nothing here for me to take?

1680
01:45:54,660 --> 01:45:55,660
No little among us?

1681
01:45:56,600 --> 01:45:56,860
Nothing?

1682
01:46:04,600 --> 01:46:06,340
Lower thy gaze.

1683
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,240
Her eyes are up there though.

1684
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:12,260
What is this?

1685
01:46:17,490 --> 01:46:19,570
Quite the hoarder these giants are.

1686
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:23,510
Oh my god!

1687
01:46:23,970 --> 01:46:24,450
That's...

1688
01:46:24,450 --> 01:46:25,950
That's so cursed!

1689
01:46:26,530 --> 01:46:28,490
Ok Gina, I don't think there's anything here.

1690
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:30,430
This is scary as hell.

1691
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:31,470
I don't like that one.

1692
01:46:31,670 --> 01:46:33,050
Is there a giant underneath that?

1693
01:46:33,190 --> 01:46:33,930
Is this alive?

1694
01:46:34,310 --> 01:46:35,570
You think this is alive?

1695
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:38,530
You think this is...

1696
01:46:38,530 --> 01:46:38,770
Ok.

1697
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:39,990
Maybe not.

1698
01:46:40,590 --> 01:46:41,970
Where are you at?

1699
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:45,330
Weeping angel.

1700
01:46:52,030 --> 01:46:53,790
Oh you found it.

1701
01:46:55,850 --> 01:46:58,350
That looks exactly like a cat mummy.

1702
01:46:59,270 --> 01:47:01,170
What the hell is this thing?

1703
01:47:04,770 --> 01:47:06,370
Forget the cat mummy.

1704
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:10,290
I need the story of everything else on this shelf.

1705
01:47:16,510 --> 01:47:18,510
I don't care about the cat...

1706
01:47:18,510 --> 01:47:20,810
The cat mummy looks exactly like a cat mummy.

1707
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:23,650
What was Indy trying to be like so...

1708
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:25,670
Takes a trained eye.

1709
01:47:26,930 --> 01:47:28,010
But this?

1710
01:47:28,790 --> 01:47:30,950
What do you even describe that as?

1711
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:32,870
Goblin.

1712
01:47:33,890 --> 01:47:34,830
That's a minky.

1713
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:38,710
I want it so bad.

1714
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:41,370
I want it.

1715
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:46,810
Oh wow, it's much bigger than I thought it would be.

1716
01:47:49,050 --> 01:47:49,610
Aww.

1717
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:59,870
That's... that's a real life giant, Dr. Jones.

1718
01:48:00,350 --> 01:48:00,610
Yep.

1719
01:48:04,510 --> 01:48:05,310
You're Locus, right?

1720
01:48:11,970 --> 01:48:13,730
But... but they're trying to do bad with him.

1721
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:14,070
Sure.

1722
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:16,970
Bad first impressions.

1723
01:48:17,970 --> 01:48:18,690
On all that.

1724
01:48:18,770 --> 01:48:20,210
But that's water under the bridge.

1725
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:24,070
Doesn't mean that we can't still talk this out like...

1726
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:25,090
Civilization.

1727
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:28,670
Oh my god.

1728
01:48:31,510 --> 01:48:33,350
She just threw him back at him.

1729
01:48:33,410 --> 01:48:33,850
Oh my god.

1730
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:34,990
Am I gonna have to fight this thing?

1731
01:48:37,930 --> 01:48:38,570
Oh my god.

1732
01:48:39,150 --> 01:48:40,170
What do you mean over here?

1733
01:48:40,870 --> 01:48:41,830
What do you mean over here?

1734
01:48:41,850 --> 01:48:42,010
Oh.

1735
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:45,090
Oh my god.

1736
01:48:50,570 --> 01:48:51,230
Take him.

1737
01:48:51,390 --> 01:48:52,550
Take him.

1738
01:48:52,710 --> 01:48:53,450
Take him...

1739
01:48:53,450 --> 01:48:57,370
You stole from me first!

1740
01:48:57,810 --> 01:48:58,210
Oh my god.

1741
01:49:01,550 --> 01:49:03,010
I'm repeatedly pressing.

1742
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:04,550
Oh my god.

1743
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:06,070
Gina, you can help.

1744
01:49:07,950 --> 01:49:08,710
Oh my god.

1745
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:09,150
Oh my god.

1746
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,650
Punch him.

1747
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:12,370
Punch him.

1748
01:49:14,290 --> 01:49:15,270
Are we trying?

1749
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:20,630
Damn.

1750
01:49:20,930 --> 01:49:22,210
He doesn't take any hit.

1751
01:49:30,840 --> 01:49:32,380
You do have a gun.

1752
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:32,760
True!

1753
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:33,620
Oh wait.

1754
01:49:33,720 --> 01:49:34,620
How do I switch to my gun?

1755
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:35,880
There we go.

1756
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:37,360
Revolver.

1757
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:42,660
Oh Gina, you might wanna...

1758
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,500
You might wanna get out of the way for that one.

1759
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:48,260
Oh my god.

1760
01:49:48,340 --> 01:49:48,680
Oh my god.

1761
01:49:48,740 --> 01:49:49,100
Oh my god.

1762
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:49,480
Oh my god.

1763
01:49:50,060 --> 01:49:50,540
Oh god.

1764
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:56,090
Oh god.

1765
01:49:58,190 --> 01:49:58,550
Ow!

1766
01:49:59,310 --> 01:49:59,530
Ow!

1767
01:49:59,570 --> 01:50:00,630
Where's my hitbox?

1768
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:02,310
Oh my god.

1769
01:50:02,430 --> 01:50:03,590
Where the...

1770
01:50:04,710 --> 01:50:06,310
This is so goofy looking.

1771
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:07,770
Oh my god.

1772
01:50:08,130 --> 01:50:08,970
Oh my god.

1773
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:09,570
He hit her.

1774
01:50:12,750 --> 01:50:14,070
Is he bulletproof?

1775
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:17,130
How am I supposed to...

1776
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:18,430
Oh my god.

1777
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,310
I don't know how to...

1778
01:50:25,170 --> 01:50:27,310
I feel like I'm gonna have to redo this part, but...

1779
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:28,150
Ow!

1780
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:28,970
My god!

1781
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:36,130
I'm gonna... I'm gonna die for sure, but...

1782
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:37,330
What the fuck?

1783
01:50:37,590 --> 01:50:38,370
Oh my god.

1784
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:44,170
I don't think it's a matter of blocking, cause like...

1785
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:47,310
This guy... Oh my god, I'm finally...

1786
01:50:48,110 --> 01:50:48,750
Can I?

1787
01:50:49,230 --> 01:50:50,050
Ok, thank you.

1788
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:50,590
Thanks Gina.

1789
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:02,480
She can take a hit.

1790
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:04,140
She can take a hit.

1791
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:04,900
Oh god!

1792
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:05,760
Oh no she can't!

1793
01:51:06,020 --> 01:51:06,620
Oh my god!

1794
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:08,620
Oh my god!

1795
01:51:22,580 --> 01:51:23,360
I'm blocking.

1796
01:51:23,560 --> 01:51:23,900
I'm blocking.

1797
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:24,500
I'm blocking.

1798
01:51:24,680 --> 01:51:25,040
I'm blocking.

1799
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:31,980
I'm trying to... Oh my god.

1800
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:32,380
Oh my god.

1801
01:51:37,780 --> 01:51:39,280
I can't tell... Is that me?

1802
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:41,460
Who's...

1803
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:42,500
No!

1804
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:43,000
No!

1805
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:43,220
No!

1806
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:51,530
Oh Indy.

1807
01:51:51,650 --> 01:51:51,910
Indy.

1808
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:52,290
Indy.

1809
01:51:52,630 --> 01:51:54,510
What the hell?

1810
01:51:56,890 --> 01:51:58,150
I'm gonna die for real.

1811
01:51:58,250 --> 01:51:58,990
Girl, please.

1812
01:51:59,450 --> 01:52:00,170
Gina, please.

1813
01:52:01,590 --> 01:52:02,890
Gina, my heartbeat.

1814
01:52:03,710 --> 01:52:05,150
I can hear it in my ears.

1815
01:52:06,510 --> 01:52:08,030
I can hear it in my ears.

1816
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:09,510
Oh my god.

1817
01:52:09,790 --> 01:52:10,890
Can you do something about him?

1818
01:52:11,470 --> 01:52:12,610
Oh he's coming after me!

1819
01:52:16,030 --> 01:52:17,150
Oh my god.

1820
01:52:18,810 --> 01:52:22,050
Oh he's like the final boss of CQC.

1821
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:24,570
He's just like the boss for real.

1822
01:52:31,250 --> 01:52:32,850
Oh my god.

1823
01:52:33,890 --> 01:52:34,690
Oh my god.

1824
01:52:36,650 --> 01:52:37,250
Yeah!

1825
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:37,790
Yeah!

1826
01:52:41,240 --> 01:52:42,620
Keep getting his ass!

1827
01:52:42,700 --> 01:52:43,740
Keep getting his ass!

1828
01:52:44,200 --> 01:52:44,800
Yeah!

1829
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,260
Tie him up!

1830
01:52:52,220 --> 01:52:52,840
Oh my god.

1831
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,360
I did it.

1832
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:54,720
Yeah!

1833
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:55,680
First try!

1834
01:52:58,020 --> 01:52:59,100
Shoot him!

1835
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:02,120
He's huge.

1836
01:53:15,320 --> 01:53:17,000
Oh John!

1837
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:22,500
Benito?

1838
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:25,460
Bravo.

1839
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:26,400
Benito?

1840
01:53:39,100 --> 01:53:40,120
It's Amarek!

1841
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:04,440
Papa?

1842
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,400
Papa?

1843
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:14,900
Papa?

1844
01:54:37,110 --> 01:54:38,430
Is this...

1845
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:45,170
This doesn't sound Italian.

1846
01:54:46,230 --> 01:54:47,150
What the...

1847
01:54:53,050 --> 01:54:54,010
It's German.

1848
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:55,130
Okay, that's what I was gonna say.

1849
01:54:57,670 --> 01:54:58,830
I know he's German.

1850
01:55:00,770 --> 01:55:03,310
Does this guy know German too?

1851
01:55:04,150 --> 01:55:05,810
They just all speak in different languages?

1852
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,490
He's so scary looking.

1853
01:55:30,430 --> 01:55:31,210
Oh my god.

1854
01:55:31,630 --> 01:55:32,390
Stop spitting.

1855
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:39,270
Why do you look like that?

1856
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,020
Oh no!

1857
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:07,940
He's got the cat!

1858
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:11,180
Oh my god.

1859
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:24,830
Oh my god, it's so painful.

1860
01:56:43,140 --> 01:56:44,680
You belonged in a museum!

1861
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:49,540
I can't believe... Wait, so there was never a mummy in there to begin with?

1862
01:56:53,780 --> 01:56:54,180
Octum!

1863
01:57:00,420 --> 01:57:02,000
Don't take the... wait.

1864
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:08,550
Wait, where's our Goblin?

1865
01:57:09,110 --> 01:57:10,010
He's disappeared!

1866
01:57:11,270 --> 01:57:12,790
You guys, I think he came to life!

1867
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,230
The Great Circle!

1868
01:57:17,350 --> 01:57:19,090
And our Goblin is gone!

1869
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:37,660
And there aren't even all of them.

1870
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:39,200
Don't worry, father.

1871
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:41,800
There are only four pieces left to be found.

1872
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:44,800
Send him on them, you know?

1873
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:55,900
No, you should have had him attack them.

1874
01:57:55,940 --> 01:57:56,940
I have to warn you, Herr Voss.

1875
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,400
The relics are dangerous.

1876
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:05,260
They are supposed to protect forces that are not of this world.

1877
01:58:06,120 --> 01:58:06,820
So he does know their purpose.

1878
01:58:13,540 --> 01:58:16,100
That's when the Ark didn't make it.

1879
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:20,100
Gotta go after the Great Circle.

1880
01:58:20,940 --> 01:58:27,380
As soon as we have all the relics, our nations will be unstoppable.

1881
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,840
He looks so pleased.

1882
01:58:42,680 --> 01:58:47,760
If one freaky mythical object doesn't work, you go after...

1883
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,740
You go after the next freaky...

1884
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:55,240
freaky thing.

1885
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:01,700
Yeah, you feel bad now, Papa Ventura?

1886
01:59:03,300 --> 01:59:03,880
Stupid.

1887
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,640
Impressive that they have accents in German speech, Italian speaking German.

1888
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:15,380
Nice detail.

1889
01:59:19,550 --> 01:59:24,090
So it wasn't us that took the cat, so you can...

1890
01:59:29,710 --> 01:59:30,450
Oh.

1891
01:59:31,530 --> 01:59:35,990
No, our cat.

1892
01:59:37,940 --> 01:59:38,970
Is he there?

1893
01:59:39,310 --> 01:59:39,750
Oh

1894
02:00:02,430 --> 02:00:05,270
my god!

1895
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:07,550
That's so sad!

1896
02:00:16,490 --> 02:00:19,350
Ok, hold on, I'm mourning, please!

1897
02:00:20,570 --> 02:00:22,770
Oh wow, I didn't even see this room.

1898
02:00:24,410 --> 02:00:26,830
These are so scary, why are they facing the wall?

1899
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:35,010
This is so... I hate, I hate, I hate sheet ghosts, they scare me.

1900
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:40,450
Oh, Indiana Jones Revengeance, right?

1901
02:00:40,990 --> 02:00:42,310
Oh, Rosie's letter.

1902
02:00:43,190 --> 02:00:44,090
Hold on!

1903
02:00:44,930 --> 02:00:47,970
If I just listened to you, I would have never gotten this!

1904
02:00:47,970 --> 02:00:51,450
To the head of the Vatican treasure chamber collection.

1905
02:00:51,890 --> 02:00:56,330
Evidence has emerged that Ventura has been conspiring with Mussolini to let him into the chamber.

1906
02:00:56,730 --> 02:01:02,830
It is not a far fetched thought that it is Ventura himself who is somehow responsible for the Pope's current condition.

1907
02:01:04,370 --> 02:01:07,570
I think we could have deduced that ourselves.

1908
02:01:07,750 --> 02:01:08,910
Goblin Slayer!

1909
02:01:10,710 --> 02:01:11,190
No!

1910
02:01:11,930 --> 02:01:12,830
Do you still have it?

1911
02:01:13,030 --> 02:01:14,210
No, I threw it away.

1912
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:19,070
We have to act quickly, or some of the most holy items could end up in the wrong hands.

1913
02:01:19,330 --> 02:01:23,150
We have to tread lightly, or we risk causing a political crisis that could spiral out of control.

1914
02:01:23,990 --> 02:01:24,710
Do you still have it?

1915
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:28,050
Removing the keys from Ventura's possession could buy us some time.

1916
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:29,750
I hope we are not too late.

1917
02:01:30,110 --> 02:01:31,350
Dante wrote... Dante!

1918
02:01:33,390 --> 02:01:36,630
If the Vatican's secret agency tried to stop Ventura...

1919
02:01:36,630 --> 02:01:38,330
Do you still have it?

1920
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,370
Hold on, I need more bandages.

1921
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:41,830
What's this?

1922
02:01:42,790 --> 02:01:43,630
Grab it.

1923
02:01:43,930 --> 02:01:44,330
Grab it.

1924
02:01:44,930 --> 02:01:46,030
What do we have here?

1925
02:01:47,190 --> 02:01:48,910
Ziggurat dig report.

1926
02:01:49,830 --> 02:01:50,970
I cannot open the door.

1927
02:01:51,190 --> 02:01:53,670
Oh my god, she is so annoying!

1928
02:01:53,970 --> 02:01:54,610
Shut up!

1929
02:01:54,690 --> 02:01:55,730
Hold on, Cheetah!

1930
02:01:57,470 --> 02:02:10,270
The expedition to Ur-Iraq, led by Peruvian archaeologist Andres Silvio Uribe, was carefully monitored by Vatican agents to ensure the preservation of its secrets.

1931
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:18,630
Two young archaeologists, Henry Jones Jr. and Rene Belloc, were also present on the site.

1932
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:22,910
I'm gonna shoot her.

1933
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:29,490
Uribe's staff discovered a previously unknown chamber along with several artifacts.

1934
02:02:29,690 --> 02:02:33,870
Among them was a stone tablet related to the Great Circle uncovered by Henry Jones Jr.

1935
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:53,270
The item was acquired by the VSA agent without rousing attention as plenty of more mundane but also more valuable items were found by Uribe's team.

1936
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:59,630
Rene Belloc proceeded to steal and later sell these artifacts which helped to mask the theft of the tablet.

1937
02:03:00,630 --> 02:03:08,290
The loss of the artifacts damaged Dr. Uribe's reputation and no further inquiry was made on the loss of the stone tablet.

1938
02:03:09,110 --> 02:03:10,210
Ok, God.

1939
02:03:10,910 --> 02:03:14,050
Ok, I'm gonna open the door for you and then I'm gonna look through the rest of the room.

1940
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:16,150
I swear to God, Gina.

1941
02:03:16,270 --> 02:03:17,930
I swear to God.

1942
02:03:18,850 --> 02:03:19,990
I have enough bullets.

1943
02:03:26,480 --> 02:03:28,280
I'm working on it, lady!

1944
02:03:29,680 --> 02:03:30,980
Do what you want.

1945
02:03:42,700 --> 02:03:47,040
I've had a run in with the Nazis before and trust me, it ain't a walk in the park.

1946
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:48,320
Ok, then.

1947
02:03:48,720 --> 02:03:49,860
Let's see if you can keep up.

1948
02:03:52,100 --> 02:03:53,820
What do you mean if I can keep up?

1949
02:03:56,180 --> 02:03:56,700
Wait, no!

1950
02:03:59,320 --> 02:04:01,620
I didn't finish looking through the room.

1951
02:04:03,240 --> 02:04:05,000
Oh my God, now we're so far away.

1952
02:04:10,140 --> 02:04:11,480
That damn smile.

1953
02:04:16,160 --> 02:04:18,840
Oh, and it's locked.

1954
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:30,840
Oh, are they gonna go up and run into Indiana Jones?

1955
02:04:36,740 --> 02:04:39,040
It's just us hitching a ride probably.

1956
02:04:48,860 --> 02:04:49,380
Uh...

1957
02:04:52,120 --> 02:04:52,640
Who?

1958
02:04:52,640 --> 02:04:53,760
What do you mean who?

1959
02:04:59,440 --> 02:05:00,480
Do I...

1960
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:02,400
Catch the airship.

1961
02:05:05,550 --> 02:05:07,330
I'm swinging, I'm swinging, I'm swinging.

1962
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:08,170
And jump.

1963
02:05:08,770 --> 02:05:09,490
Good job, Indy.

1964
02:05:10,090 --> 02:05:11,130
Wait, can I jump from here?

1965
02:05:12,210 --> 02:05:13,210
I imagine I can.

1966
02:05:15,170 --> 02:05:15,930
Oh God, I'm scared.

1967
02:05:18,630 --> 02:05:19,270
Nice.

1968
02:05:22,150 --> 02:05:22,790
Nothing?

1969
02:05:26,070 --> 02:05:27,190
Oh my God.

1970
02:05:28,450 --> 02:05:29,190
Indy, don't fall.

1971
02:05:32,970 --> 02:05:33,610
Nice.

1972
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:35,410
I'm so good.

1973
02:05:35,730 --> 02:05:36,630
Yeah, it's a big rat.

1974
02:05:39,070 --> 02:05:41,410
Oh my God, it's so beautiful.

1975
02:05:43,530 --> 02:05:47,190
Rooftop of St. Peter's Basilica.

1976
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:58,000
Oh, I went the wrong way.

1977
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,800
Wait, how did I...

1978
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:06,720
Please, let me up.

1979
02:06:07,200 --> 02:06:07,660
Let me up.

1980
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:08,180
Uppies?

1981
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:09,060
Uppies, please.

1982
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:10,820
Wait, I can't go any other way.

1983
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:11,780
Uppies, please.

1984
02:06:11,820 --> 02:06:12,220
There we go.

1985
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:23,380
Which... I think I want to go... I don't want to be up there, do I?

1986
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:26,180
Oh yes, I do.

1987
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:27,540
That's where the white paint is.

1988
02:06:30,340 --> 02:06:32,600
Oh, what's down here though?

1989
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:36,620
Is there anything?

1990
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:38,340
Feels like there is something.

1991
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:39,680
Maybe not.

1992
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:42,520
Arby!

1993
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:45,080
What a view.

1994
02:06:50,380 --> 02:06:51,580
Good job, Indy.

1995
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:55,600
Press L to climb faster.

1996
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:01,180
Okay, now... Up.

1997
02:07:01,800 --> 02:07:02,000
Up.

1998
02:07:02,580 --> 02:07:02,820
Up.

1999
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:04,820
Oh God, oh God.

2000
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:05,660
Stop moving, Indy.

2001
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:07,440
Rest your little arms.

2002
02:07:10,940 --> 02:07:11,360
Oh.

2003
02:07:11,480 --> 02:07:11,860
Oh!

2004
02:07:17,670 --> 02:07:18,090
Yay!

2005
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:21,550
Now to upgrade your grip gauge.

2006
02:07:22,270 --> 02:07:26,570
I don't think that was... The grip gauge is only for... The one that I have left is only for enemies.

2007
02:07:29,570 --> 02:07:31,110
Oh my gosh, so scary.

2008
02:07:38,050 --> 02:07:38,770
Climbing.

2009
02:07:39,270 --> 02:07:40,030
We're climbing.

2010
02:07:40,250 --> 02:07:40,570
We're climbing.

2011
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:42,650
In we go.

2012
02:07:43,390 --> 02:07:46,450
And in we...

2013
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,370
Dork.

2014
02:07:51,660 --> 02:07:52,240
What's that sound?

2015
02:07:54,220 --> 02:07:55,940
Oh, they're giving me more bullets.

2016
02:07:56,380 --> 02:07:58,180
I could probably shoot this guy.

2017
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:06,350
I could probably shoot this guy.

2018
02:08:17,990 --> 02:08:19,230
Why don't I have any more bullets?

2019
02:08:33,020 --> 02:08:33,920
It's okay.

2020
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:34,880
I'm safe.

2021
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:37,960
Probably.

2022
02:08:39,120 --> 02:08:40,060
Are they going to come around?

2023
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:45,100
Watch where you're shooting, buddy.

2024
02:08:49,890 --> 02:08:51,290
Hello?

2025
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:55,270
That guy took that bullet like a champ.

2026
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:05,130
I think we're fine.

2027
02:09:06,630 --> 02:09:07,410
Maybe.

2028
02:09:11,850 --> 02:09:13,050
Moving on.

2029
02:09:14,490 --> 02:09:15,390
Okay.

2030
02:09:15,390 --> 02:09:15,450
Okay.

2031
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:18,550
Yeah.

2032
02:09:22,110 --> 02:09:22,630
Yeah.

2033
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:25,070
Anyway.

2034
02:09:25,410 --> 02:09:26,190
Ah, thank you.

2035
02:09:27,470 --> 02:09:28,530
Master of stealth.

2036
02:09:28,690 --> 02:09:29,090
Absolutely.

2037
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:30,510
What are the repair kits for?

2038
02:09:31,450 --> 02:09:33,610
I keep grabbing them, but I have no idea what they're for.

2039
02:09:36,450 --> 02:09:39,170
Do they think they see me under...

2040
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:49,300
They're really... They're really... I really confused them.

2041
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:53,240
You can repair weapons.

2042
02:09:53,740 --> 02:09:55,080
Oh, this door is blocked.

2043
02:09:55,220 --> 02:09:55,740
Okay, hold on.

2044
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:56,520
Where do we go up from?

2045
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:00,140
It looks like about here.

2046
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:04,500
Here I go up from...

2047
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:06,760
Jump.

2048
02:10:09,060 --> 02:10:09,540
Jump.

2049
02:10:10,240 --> 02:10:11,000
Jump, Indy.

2050
02:10:11,280 --> 02:10:11,520
Jump.

2051
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:12,740
Oh, my goodness.

2052
02:10:13,200 --> 02:10:14,280
Come on, Indiana Jones.

2053
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:16,760
And jump.

2054
02:10:17,680 --> 02:10:18,400
And jump.

2055
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,320
There we go.

2056
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:30,840
But, like, if I can't shoot them through the thing...

2057
02:10:31,460 --> 02:10:34,240
They shouldn't be able to shoot me through the stairs.

2058
02:10:34,740 --> 02:10:35,180
Right?

2059
02:10:35,960 --> 02:10:37,920
Like, that's just how it should work.

2060
02:10:39,160 --> 02:10:39,940
Where do I... Oh.

2061
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:40,300
Huh?

2062
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,640
Where do I go from here?

2063
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:45,900
Oh, over there.

2064
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:46,440
Okay, I see.

2065
02:10:50,520 --> 02:10:51,360
What do you mean, huh?

2066
02:10:51,780 --> 02:10:51,900
Oh.

2067
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:53,560
Did he hear me?

2068
02:10:58,160 --> 02:10:58,520
Hey!

2069
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:02,080
Oh, my God.

2070
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:02,560
He's got a gun.

2071
02:11:27,950 --> 02:11:28,670
Oh, shit.

2072
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:29,750
I'm dead.

2073
02:11:33,390 --> 02:11:34,610
So... Oh, my God.

2074
02:11:34,610 --> 02:11:35,490
All the way here?

2075
02:11:35,490 --> 02:11:37,530
Okay, so, funny story.

2076
02:11:37,650 --> 02:11:39,670
These guys hit like crazy hard.

2077
02:11:40,890 --> 02:11:41,410
Damn.

2078
02:11:43,070 --> 02:11:44,930
Well, I'm reloading right now.

2079
02:11:49,310 --> 02:11:50,270
Oh, damn.

2080
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:51,510
They hit like crazy.

2081
02:11:53,150 --> 02:11:53,730
Let's eat.

2082
02:11:53,890 --> 02:11:55,890
Or let's bandage and eat and stuff.

2083
02:11:58,250 --> 02:12:01,830
Well, I took that one guy down with one bullet, so that was pretty good.

2084
02:12:04,170 --> 02:12:07,310
But everything else was not so good.

2085
02:12:07,390 --> 02:12:09,010
Wow, I can't believe they...

2086
02:12:10,030 --> 02:12:12,730
I can't believe they make you go all the way back over here.

2087
02:12:14,370 --> 02:12:16,790
Like, I feel like they should let you through.

2088
02:12:17,490 --> 02:12:20,090
At least, like, have the same save point up there.

2089
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:22,390
That's how I feel it should be.

2090
02:12:23,310 --> 02:12:24,190
But what do I know?

2091
02:12:26,030 --> 02:12:27,370
What do I know?

2092
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:34,930
Go, Indy, go.

2093
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:37,350
Guns are lethal.

2094
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:39,950
Yeah, but in video games, they're not.

2095
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:43,490
In video games, guns...

2096
02:12:44,050 --> 02:12:48,650
You can take, like, five bullets in video games.

2097
02:12:49,330 --> 02:12:49,870
That's all I'm saying.

2098
02:12:57,450 --> 02:12:58,450
Here we go.

2099
02:12:59,430 --> 02:13:00,250
And in.

2100
02:13:01,630 --> 02:13:02,430
The antidote.

2101
02:13:02,430 --> 02:13:02,570
That's...

2102
02:13:05,070 --> 02:13:05,710
That's two.

2103
02:13:06,970 --> 02:13:07,890
Let's do that.

2104
02:13:15,650 --> 02:13:16,730
Take more stuff.

2105
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:18,790
Take more stuff.

2106
02:13:19,210 --> 02:13:21,470
But to be fair, my health wasn't, like, all the way.

2107
02:13:22,490 --> 02:13:24,530
So, like, it could have been that too.

2108
02:13:24,770 --> 02:13:25,290
Okay, guys.

2109
02:13:25,770 --> 02:13:26,730
I gotta... wait.

2110
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:28,750
Does this pause the game?

2111
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:31,330
Not quite sure.

2112
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:33,390
I gotta go to the bathroom.

2113
02:13:34,270 --> 02:13:36,490
I gotta go to the little ghost's room.

2114
02:13:36,490 --> 02:13:38,370
So you just chill right here.

2115
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:41,050
And I'll be right back, okay?

2116
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:42,690
You guys just hang out.

2117
02:13:44,170 --> 02:13:45,490
And we won't get caught.

2118
02:13:45,590 --> 02:13:46,250
We'll be fine.

2119
02:13:46,970 --> 02:13:47,770
We'll be fine.

2120
02:13:52,640 --> 02:13:53,120
Okay.

2121
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:55,500
Keep an eye out.

2122
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:57,140
Keep an eye out for me, okay?

2123
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:58,280
Don't be scared.

2124
02:13:59,140 --> 02:14:00,080
Don't be scared.

2125
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,100
There's nothing to be scared of, okay?

2126
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:05,380
Okay.

2127
02:14:05,960 --> 02:14:06,780
I'll be right back.

2128
02:15:54,950 --> 02:15:55,430
Okay.

2129
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:50,970
Sorry about that.

2130
02:17:51,090 --> 02:17:51,730
I'm back.

2131
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:53,070
Sorry.

2132
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:54,470
I couldn't find my cat.

2133
02:17:57,230 --> 02:17:58,190
And then...

2134
02:17:58,190 --> 02:18:01,170
Usually she's, like, in a window, but she was under my bed.

2135
02:18:03,250 --> 02:18:05,890
I like to check on my cats when I take a break.

2136
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,790
Oh, whoops.

2137
02:18:07,930 --> 02:18:08,290
Wrong way.

2138
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:11,430
Okay.

2139
02:18:11,430 --> 02:18:11,870
Alright.

2140
02:18:13,730 --> 02:18:14,170
Indeed.

2141
02:18:14,430 --> 02:18:15,230
Don't make so much noise.

2142
02:18:16,910 --> 02:18:17,450
Oh, bless you.

2143
02:18:20,430 --> 02:18:21,150
Bless you.

2144
02:18:21,730 --> 02:18:24,030
God, these guys are...

2145
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:26,650
I could take him out.

2146
02:18:27,530 --> 02:18:28,970
I could take him out right now.

2147
02:18:32,170 --> 02:18:33,330
I could take him out.

2148
02:18:33,450 --> 02:18:34,930
Actually, that probably would have been perfect.

2149
02:18:35,130 --> 02:18:35,910
Oh, I'm still gone fishing.

2150
02:18:36,110 --> 02:18:37,030
Thank you.

2151
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,500
I should have done it.

2152
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:48,140
Maybe I should.

2153
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:55,400
I mean, they give me more bullets.

2154
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:59,400
Alright, once he comes back...

2155
02:18:59,880 --> 02:19:02,140
Once he comes back, we'll take him out.

2156
02:19:02,560 --> 02:19:05,200
And then the other guys will come over and we'll take those guys out.

2157
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,780
And then the ghost will be clear.

2158
02:19:07,320 --> 02:19:08,860
And it'll be...

2159
02:19:16,340 --> 02:19:17,720
I don't know if they'll see me.

2160
02:19:32,680 --> 02:19:34,260
How did he see me?

2161
02:19:34,780 --> 02:19:35,820
How did he see me?

2162
02:19:37,060 --> 02:19:38,440
How did he see me?

2163
02:19:43,650 --> 02:19:44,790
Oh, there he is.

2164
02:19:48,650 --> 02:19:50,010
What do you mean?

2165
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:51,970
You literally shot at me, mister.

2166
02:19:58,560 --> 02:19:59,120
Hello?

2167
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:04,540
Nothing here.

2168
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,520
No way.

2169
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:07,400
Hello?

2170
02:20:12,180 --> 02:20:13,600
Anybody gonna come right here?

2171
02:20:19,890 --> 02:20:21,330
All I hear is...

2172
02:20:32,790 --> 02:20:33,450
Oh my god.

2173
02:20:33,450 --> 02:20:34,410
Oh my god, so there's three.

2174
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:35,950
At least.

2175
02:20:40,300 --> 02:20:42,780
Wait, how did that one guy see me through here?

2176
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:44,760
He's gone by now?

2177
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:46,600
How did he see me through there?

2178
02:20:50,140 --> 02:20:50,580
Um,

2179
02:20:55,890 --> 02:20:57,310
I don't... I'm not quite...

2180
02:20:57,310 --> 02:20:58,230
Search is off?

2181
02:20:58,730 --> 02:21:00,930
Okay, I'm not quite sure what to do here.

2182
02:21:06,030 --> 02:21:06,390
Um...

2183
02:21:06,390 --> 02:21:07,610
That was cool?

2184
02:21:08,170 --> 02:21:08,910
Or did he see me?

2185
02:21:09,010 --> 02:21:10,050
No, he didn't see me through there.

2186
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:20,080
Maybe the next guy will come and check out the window.

2187
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:26,960
Oh, guns a-blazin'?

2188
02:21:26,960 --> 02:21:28,200
Yeah, but I'll die.

2189
02:21:28,380 --> 02:21:30,500
If I die, I don't want to do all the parkour stuff again.

2190
02:21:41,290 --> 02:21:42,930
Oh wait, that's the dead guy.

2191
02:21:42,930 --> 02:21:43,010
Okay.

2192
02:21:46,510 --> 02:21:48,450
Nevermind, that's the guy we shot.

2193
02:21:53,170 --> 02:21:54,090
Okay, okay.

2194
02:21:55,530 --> 02:21:57,750
You can stealth take down these guys pretty easily.

2195
02:21:58,470 --> 02:22:00,130
I don't have a weapon or anything though.

2196
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:02,530
To take them down with.

2197
02:22:03,610 --> 02:22:05,150
I want them to leave.

2198
02:22:07,050 --> 02:22:07,530
Okay,

2199
02:22:10,770 --> 02:22:12,010
my fists...

2200
02:22:12,010 --> 02:22:13,630
Alright, alright.

2201
02:22:13,790 --> 02:22:15,110
I'm scared, these guys scare me.

2202
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:16,350
They have guns.

2203
02:22:16,810 --> 02:22:19,810
It's the first time I think we've dealt with guns.

2204
02:22:20,390 --> 02:22:21,410
Alright, give them hands.

2205
02:22:21,590 --> 02:22:22,970
Alright, let's go give them hands!

2206
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:29,560
Am I crouched?

2207
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:32,260
Bless you.

2208
02:22:47,130 --> 02:22:48,390
Oh my god, he scared me.

2209
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:50,230
Anybody else?

2210
02:22:50,590 --> 02:22:51,450
Maybe I'll just go.

2211
02:23:00,360 --> 02:23:01,240
Take that.

2212
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:02,460
Not the body.

2213
02:23:02,660 --> 02:23:03,340
I don't care about that.

2214
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:04,680
Nice.

2215
02:23:05,420 --> 02:23:06,320
I've got hands.

2216
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:08,080
I've got hands.

2217
02:23:08,580 --> 02:23:09,780
I've got hands.

2218
02:23:10,580 --> 02:23:11,520
I've got hands.

2219
02:23:12,260 --> 02:23:13,060
I've got hands.

2220
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:13,780
I've got hands.

2221
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:24,060
Open fire where?

2222
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:25,860
No!

2223
02:23:27,260 --> 02:23:27,860
Anyway.

2224
02:23:28,780 --> 02:23:31,080
Oh god, I love beating people up.

2225
02:23:32,240 --> 02:23:33,660
What a view.

2226
02:23:33,940 --> 02:23:35,320
No wonder you wanted this area.

2227
02:23:40,460 --> 02:23:41,100
Mine.

2228
02:23:43,160 --> 02:23:44,140
Mine now.

2229
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:45,320
Let's go.

2230
02:23:49,740 --> 02:23:50,700
Minky sweet.

2231
02:23:51,860 --> 02:23:52,880
Anything else over here?

2232
02:23:56,380 --> 02:23:57,480
I hear someone moving.

2233
02:23:58,100 --> 02:23:58,820
I better not have.

2234
02:23:59,440 --> 02:24:02,140
Ok, we know there is one more guy at least.

2235
02:24:10,020 --> 02:24:12,200
Now it's a blunt weapon.

2236
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:20,480
Oh I saved.

2237
02:24:20,580 --> 02:24:20,880
Nice.

2238
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:22,320
Wait, there was nothing else?

2239
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:23,840
No items for us to collect?

2240
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:25,080
Nothing?

2241
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:27,900
I love how you can pick up so many things in this game.

2242
02:24:27,900 --> 02:24:30,920
There is so many things you can use as a weapon in this game.

2243
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:31,980
Wow, a biotic info!

2244
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:33,340
Thank you so much for the tech gifted.

2245
02:24:33,800 --> 02:24:34,520
Thank you!

2246
02:24:36,940 --> 02:24:39,060
Wish I could take their uniforms.

2247
02:24:41,180 --> 02:24:43,240
Can I have another disguise now please?

2248
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:44,560
Ok.

2249
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:46,380
A toilet plunger.

2250
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:48,220
Yeah, like...

2251
02:24:48,220 --> 02:24:52,400
I would just be embarrassed if I were beaten up with a toilet plunger.

2252
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,960
I think I would give up.

2253
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:55,440
Ok, here we go.

2254
02:24:56,440 --> 02:24:58,080
What's this?

2255
02:24:58,820 --> 02:25:00,580
Drinking on the job?

2256
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:14,440
Sorry.

2257
02:25:18,440 --> 02:25:19,300
Our strut.

2258
02:25:27,960 --> 02:25:29,660
Why are you not in your cassock?

2259
02:25:30,380 --> 02:25:32,780
And not in the library with Father Antonio?

2260
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:34,600
Funny.

2261
02:25:34,880 --> 02:25:35,660
Just want to check out the view.

2262
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:36,080
Yeah.

2263
02:25:36,620 --> 02:25:39,140
You know us Americans, always knows when about.

2264
02:25:40,520 --> 02:25:42,760
With a gun and a whip.

2265
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:53,070
You'd be surprised how often it comes in handy.

2266
02:25:53,130 --> 02:25:54,710
He whimpered at me.

2267
02:25:55,530 --> 02:25:55,830
Traitors.

2268
02:25:57,210 --> 02:25:57,810
Conspirators.

2269
02:25:58,730 --> 02:25:59,330
Liars!

2270
02:25:59,630 --> 02:26:01,910
And now I also have to deal with spies?

2271
02:26:02,930 --> 02:26:03,890
Oh I'm no spy.

2272
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:08,770
Do I still have my gun?

2273
02:26:16,250 --> 02:26:18,030
Did we bring him with us?

2274
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:19,250
Demon!

2275
02:26:26,810 --> 02:26:29,750
That was like the weakest looking punch ever.

2276
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:31,930
It was like hitting a cloud.

2277
02:26:34,170 --> 02:26:36,010
Oh my god, he is just tall.

2278
02:26:36,710 --> 02:26:38,710
I guess we are buds now.

2279
02:26:40,950 --> 02:26:41,590
Demon!

2280
02:26:41,590 --> 02:26:42,230
Demon!

2281
02:26:50,100 --> 02:26:51,680
Indy, how do we get up there?

2282
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:53,440
Indy!

2283
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:17,800
Damn.

2284
02:27:18,180 --> 02:27:18,440
Yeah.

2285
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:23,940
Demon!

2286
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,560
How many giants are there?

2287
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:28,320
Oh my god.

2288
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:30,080
Father Antonio...

2289
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:36,560
I think we are leaving Italy.

2290
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:40,440
Sayonara!

2291
02:27:40,780 --> 02:27:42,300
Are we going to hold on the entire time?

2292
02:27:43,420 --> 02:27:43,860
Please.

2293
02:27:43,860 --> 02:27:44,120
Please.

2294
02:27:48,460 --> 02:27:50,860
Might want to swing...

2295
02:27:51,480 --> 02:27:52,860
Back and forth...

2296
02:27:53,660 --> 02:27:54,440
Until we do that.

2297
02:27:54,580 --> 02:27:55,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2298
02:27:55,260 --> 02:27:55,660
There we go.

2299
02:28:04,870 --> 02:28:06,410
Okay, watch my...

2300
02:28:07,830 --> 02:28:08,790
Watch my...

2301
02:28:08,790 --> 02:28:09,550
What's it called?

2302
02:28:12,030 --> 02:28:13,090
Can I get to that?

2303
02:28:13,330 --> 02:28:14,270
Okay, X.

2304
02:28:14,270 --> 02:28:14,330
X?

2305
02:28:21,170 --> 02:28:23,090
How the hell?

2306
02:28:27,930 --> 02:28:32,410
It is so impressive how much he sounds like young Harrison Ford.

2307
02:28:40,150 --> 02:28:41,170
Are we...

2308
02:28:44,270 --> 02:28:46,030
We are climbing again.

2309
02:28:47,890 --> 02:28:51,750
He sounds so much like young Harrison Ford.

2310
02:28:51,870 --> 02:28:52,650
It's so crazy.

2311
02:28:54,690 --> 02:28:55,630
Okay!

2312
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,800
The Great Circle is the biggest mystery in all of archeology.

2313
02:29:22,940 --> 02:29:24,220
Do you even know what it is?

2314
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:28,140
Some kind of a fancy ring you are going to put in your museum perhaps?

2315
02:29:28,460 --> 02:29:28,720
No.

2316
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:30,600
What is it?

2317
02:29:32,040 --> 02:29:32,560
What?

2318
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:34,520
Do you have your lipstick?

2319
02:29:35,620 --> 02:29:36,740
Give it to me.

2320
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:39,500
Indirect kiss.

2321
02:29:44,280 --> 02:29:45,120
That's the Earth.

2322
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:46,560
Okay, I...

2323
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:48,580
The Great Circle is the Earth.

2324
02:29:58,960 --> 02:30:00,220
Oh,

2325
02:30:04,320 --> 02:30:04,980
Uranus.

2326
02:30:15,120 --> 02:30:17,080
Maybe it's just a fluke.

2327
02:30:17,420 --> 02:30:22,060
Or maybe Vos found something that connects these stone relics to the Great Circle.

2328
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:24,440
Her poor lipstick is unusable now.

2329
02:30:26,200 --> 02:30:27,240
They only care about power.

2330
02:30:33,300 --> 02:30:35,260
It's circular in shape.

2331
02:30:37,460 --> 02:30:38,100
Oh,

2332
02:30:42,880 --> 02:30:43,180
Saturn.

2333
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:48,620
I have to find my sister.

2334
02:30:56,230 --> 02:30:57,970
It was for the bit, okay?

2335
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:15,700
Don't worry about it.

2336
02:31:20,860 --> 02:31:22,220
Uranus really does have rings though.

2337
02:31:22,300 --> 02:31:23,020
Doesn't it actually?

2338
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:23,740
I thought so.

2339
02:31:23,820 --> 02:31:25,640
They are just not as pronounced as Saturn's.

2340
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:28,520
Yeah!

2341
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:29,740
So I was...

2342
02:31:30,300 --> 02:31:31,220
You know what?

2343
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:32,340
I knew I was right.

2344
02:31:32,440 --> 02:31:33,240
I was like wait a second.

2345
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:39,180
Gosh, you guys make me feel like I'm stupid.

2346
02:31:41,460 --> 02:31:42,540
They are just not as pronounced.

2347
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:54,640
Cool.

2348
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:00,760
They let you keep your hair?

2349
02:32:02,400 --> 02:32:04,360
Isn't that how you've been picking locks?

2350
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,600
He was looking at her so like...

2351
02:32:29,740 --> 02:32:31,660
You could stab him right now.

2352
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:39,050
So did she betray us or not?

2353
02:32:39,490 --> 02:32:41,170
She was acting so sussy before.

2354
02:32:41,530 --> 02:32:42,650
Oh my god!

2355
02:32:43,530 --> 02:32:43,930
Yeah!

2356
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:55,060
Giza!

2357
02:32:57,740 --> 02:32:58,660
The map.

2358
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:03,240
Okay, let's go.

2359
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:12,660
Uh oh.

2360
02:33:14,100 --> 02:33:18,640
The nachos.

2361
02:33:30,260 --> 02:33:30,960
Doink.

2362
02:33:34,440 --> 02:33:34,800
Doink.

2363
02:33:34,860 --> 02:33:35,480
Uh oh.

2364
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:36,900
Doink.

2365
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:37,420
Doink.

2366
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:38,520
I'll read all this later.

2367
02:33:39,140 --> 02:33:40,120
I'll read this later.

2368
02:33:40,400 --> 02:33:41,060
I'll read this later.

2369
02:33:41,740 --> 02:33:42,100
Doink.

2370
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:44,840
Oh, I'm sure it is.

2371
02:33:46,100 --> 02:33:46,920
Wait, what else is there?

2372
02:33:48,180 --> 02:33:48,540
Doink.

2373
02:33:49,660 --> 02:33:51,260
I don't know if this is timed or not.

2374
02:33:54,020 --> 02:33:54,920
Item limit reach?

2375
02:33:54,960 --> 02:33:55,720
What am I trying to grab?

2376
02:33:56,300 --> 02:33:56,800
You're in my way.

2377
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,160
Oh, this is a repair thing?

2378
02:33:59,160 --> 02:34:00,420
Okay.

2379
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:02,720
Doink.

2380
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:03,880
Nice.

2381
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:05,340
Oh, did that just open?

2382
02:34:05,980 --> 02:34:07,060
Okay, we're fine.

2383
02:34:13,330 --> 02:34:14,110
Here?

2384
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:23,180
I'm literally robbing them blind first.

2385
02:34:29,460 --> 02:34:30,740
Okay.

2386
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:33,320
Yay!

2387
02:34:39,160 --> 02:34:39,920
Oh.

2388
02:34:41,940 --> 02:34:43,460
I think we can make it.

2389
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:47,800
Just...leave.

2390
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:53,800
I love that we're taking this big ol' blimp over here.

2391
02:34:56,220 --> 02:34:57,680
Yeah, tuck and roll.

2392
02:34:57,880 --> 02:34:58,280
Exactly.

2393
02:34:59,460 --> 02:35:00,720
Welcome to Giza.

2394
02:35:09,560 --> 02:35:10,600
Really?

2395
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:15,240
Ganz.

2396
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:36,700
I really like that they kept the voices and...

2397
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:38,180
the original language.

2398
02:35:50,500 --> 02:35:52,340
He's spitting bars.

2399
02:35:57,440 --> 02:36:01,380
This guy looks like...

2400
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:11,960
He even has Huey's glasses.

2401
02:36:12,840 --> 02:36:14,540
Who should be on this blimp?

2402
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,460
Pop

2403
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:36,180
his tires.

2404
02:36:41,180 --> 02:36:42,420
Are you going to go?

2405
02:36:57,050 --> 02:36:57,570
Okay.

2406
02:36:57,570 --> 02:36:58,270
Okie dokie.

2407
02:36:58,670 --> 02:37:01,730
How are we going to sneak around here?

2408
02:37:01,930 --> 02:37:02,590
Oh boy.

2409
02:37:03,630 --> 02:37:06,690
I guess it's just like in the movies where they just snuck around in plain sight.

2410
02:37:18,510 --> 02:37:19,030
Nice.

2411
02:37:20,130 --> 02:37:21,410
Plain sight, baby.

2412
02:37:46,510 --> 02:37:49,630
How many vases will be broken in this game?

2413
02:37:50,130 --> 02:37:51,870
Before someone is satisfied.

2414
02:37:54,530 --> 02:37:57,070
Oh my god, give these poor guys some shoes, please.

2415
02:37:59,370 --> 02:37:59,890
Oh.

2416
02:38:10,130 --> 02:38:10,590
Alright.

2417
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:11,910
And we're here.

2418
02:38:16,350 --> 02:38:18,190
Blue tent in a workers area.

2419
02:38:21,010 --> 02:38:21,530
Flag?

2420
02:38:22,430 --> 02:38:23,030
What flag?

2421
02:38:24,990 --> 02:38:26,090
Oh, that flag.

2422
02:38:26,190 --> 02:38:26,350
Okay.

2423
02:38:29,830 --> 02:38:31,910
Or, I could adventure around.

2424
02:38:32,530 --> 02:38:33,250
I'm Indiana Jones.

2425
02:38:33,350 --> 02:38:33,810
Wow!

2426
02:38:34,510 --> 02:38:35,610
We're in the desert!

2427
02:38:36,210 --> 02:38:37,590
Oh my god!

2428
02:38:39,910 --> 02:38:41,430
All the

2429
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:46,940
items I've seen.

2430
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:52,100
Stop yelling at me.

2431
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:56,320
It's kind of insufferable.

2432
02:38:56,320 --> 02:38:59,520
Oh my god, it's so cool!

2433
02:39:02,200 --> 02:39:02,720
So,

2434
02:39:05,830 --> 02:39:06,070
blue tent.

2435
02:39:07,090 --> 02:39:07,650
Oh, up here.

2436
02:39:10,730 --> 02:39:11,510
Anything here?

2437
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:13,110
What is this?

2438
02:39:13,530 --> 02:39:14,550
Oh, that's for a bottle.

2439
02:39:17,010 --> 02:39:17,870
Okie dokie, blue.

2440
02:39:18,650 --> 02:39:19,430
That one over there?

2441
02:39:23,130 --> 02:39:24,170
The blue tent.

2442
02:39:24,970 --> 02:39:26,090
What are those?

2443
02:39:28,270 --> 02:39:28,890
Oh.

2444
02:39:30,080 --> 02:39:31,090
This is the blue tent?

2445
02:39:32,550 --> 02:39:33,290
Nice.

2446
02:39:36,970 --> 02:39:37,710
Wow!

2447
02:39:42,930 --> 02:39:45,650
Worst game backseater I've ever seen.

2448
02:39:45,730 --> 02:39:47,110
She's so insufferable.

2449
02:39:48,670 --> 02:39:50,170
I thought, what's her name?

2450
02:39:51,390 --> 02:39:52,130
From...

2451
02:39:52,130 --> 02:39:54,450
From Temple of Doom was annoying.

2452
02:39:54,830 --> 02:39:56,310
But like, she's just...

2453
02:40:02,210 --> 02:40:02,690
Wow.

2454
02:40:09,350 --> 02:40:12,710
Can I just like, run around here?

2455
02:40:12,870 --> 02:40:15,210
Or will people get mad at me?

2456
02:40:17,330 --> 02:40:19,410
Am I supposed to be secretive here?

2457
02:40:19,610 --> 02:40:20,710
I feel like I should be.

2458
02:40:21,350 --> 02:40:24,050
But um, I'm just gonna walk the road.

2459
02:40:25,130 --> 02:40:25,970
Nobody else is here.

2460
02:40:25,970 --> 02:40:28,410
I might...

2461
02:40:30,640 --> 02:40:32,320
I'll try and be a little secret.

2462
02:40:36,090 --> 02:40:37,990
If I walk with authority...

2463
02:40:37,990 --> 02:40:39,110
Oh, that's a...

2464
02:40:39,110 --> 02:40:40,930
If I...

2465
02:40:41,650 --> 02:40:43,890
If I walk with authority...

2466
02:40:43,890 --> 02:40:44,950
Nobody will question me.

2467
02:40:45,950 --> 02:40:47,250
What do you mean, what sound?

2468
02:40:47,470 --> 02:40:48,410
I didn't do anything!

2469
02:40:48,510 --> 02:40:49,410
I'm literally walking!

2470
02:40:53,830 --> 02:40:54,310
Authority.

2471
02:40:54,310 --> 02:40:54,370
Authority.

2472
02:40:56,890 --> 02:40:59,250
Oh my god!

2473
02:40:59,930 --> 02:41:01,530
Hey, chill out man!

2474
02:41:01,890 --> 02:41:02,530
Chill out!

2475
02:41:03,230 --> 02:41:03,630
God!

2476
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:09,580
Anyway...

2477
02:41:09,580 --> 02:41:10,960
Everything's fine!

2478
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,320
Carry on!

2479
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:18,980
Walk with authority.

2480
02:41:18,980 --> 02:41:19,060
Authority.

2481
02:41:24,640 --> 02:41:26,280
Everybody is shuffling.

2482
02:41:26,860 --> 02:41:28,980
I don't think you know what you're doing.

2483
02:41:29,700 --> 02:41:30,580
Why did you...

2484
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:32,740
Why did you walk past me like that?

2485
02:41:33,260 --> 02:41:35,080
I really wanted to see the camel.

2486
02:41:46,730 --> 02:41:48,830
Look how cute they are!

2487
02:41:50,450 --> 02:41:52,590
Why do they look so... Oh my goodness!

2488
02:41:54,810 --> 02:41:56,550
Gina, go away!

2489
02:42:00,910 --> 02:42:02,450
Okay, I'm just gonna...

2490
02:42:03,010 --> 02:42:05,450
I'm not gonna steal from you guys, but...

2491
02:42:05,990 --> 02:42:08,450
If you have anything you're willing to offer...

2492
02:42:10,270 --> 02:42:10,830
Minto...

2493
02:42:10,830 --> 02:42:12,950
I'll gladly take it.

2494
02:42:14,370 --> 02:42:15,910
Nicely detailed camel.

2495
02:42:17,010 --> 02:42:18,050
Yeah, he's really cute.

2496
02:42:18,050 --> 02:42:20,390
I love how he's like, what's that sound?

2497
02:42:20,750 --> 02:42:23,070
As if I'm not just literally taking a step.

2498
02:42:29,270 --> 02:42:33,870
Indiana Jones would be amazing in the modern day.

2499
02:42:34,130 --> 02:42:35,810
He would be the best...

2500
02:42:35,810 --> 02:42:39,070
You know those YouTubers that are like, I went to Egypt and...

2501
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:44,510
I'm just a dude and everybody was shook that I could speak the language.

2502
02:42:48,230 --> 02:42:50,290
He would kill it.

2503
02:42:51,890 --> 02:42:53,730
Oh, you guys got any bandages?

2504
02:42:54,530 --> 02:42:55,590
Donation box?

2505
02:42:57,190 --> 02:42:59,090
Wait, how did we never unlock this?

2506
02:43:01,850 --> 02:43:02,850
Oh, are you okay?

2507
02:43:06,480 --> 02:43:07,340
You okay?

2508
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,680
What's that sound?

2509
02:43:11,740 --> 02:43:15,400
It's the sound of Indiana Jones walking confidently and not shuffling like a nerd.

2510
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:19,480
And polyglot...

2511
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:21,660
Oh, that's the camel!

2512
02:43:21,980 --> 02:43:24,340
I thought it was your stomach or something.

2513
02:43:24,800 --> 02:43:26,860
He's got the worst case of IBS ever.

2514
02:43:29,200 --> 02:43:30,220
Wait, who said that?

2515
02:43:30,660 --> 02:43:31,260
Oh, hello!

2516
02:43:32,200 --> 02:43:33,600
You got...oh, what's up?

2517
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:47,000
How are the Germans treating you?

2518
02:43:47,980 --> 02:43:51,000
Well, to tell you the truth, they are being quite difficult.

2519
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:54,580
They only give me the bare minimum in terms of medical equipment.

2520
02:43:54,860 --> 02:43:56,560
I don't even have any medicine.

2521
02:43:57,280 --> 02:44:01,080
And I know for a fact the Germans have a supply, but they won't share.

2522
02:44:01,540 --> 02:44:07,340
And what if someone were to stumble upon some unattended German medicine?

2523
02:44:07,360 --> 02:44:07,920
Where's my bro Sarla?

2524
02:44:08,040 --> 02:44:09,240
Yeah, where's Sarla?

2525
02:44:10,080 --> 02:44:13,260
Then I would advise that someone deliver it here.

2526
02:44:13,840 --> 02:44:15,800
I would make sure it's put to good use.

2527
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,200
I have some leftovers from, you know, the Vatican.

2528
02:44:18,480 --> 02:44:19,380
It's still good medicine.

2529
02:44:20,180 --> 02:44:20,980
If you want that.

2530
02:44:22,720 --> 02:44:23,520
New discovery.

2531
02:44:23,680 --> 02:44:25,320
What do you need?

2532
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:26,500
What do you want?

2533
02:44:27,560 --> 02:44:28,360
Oh, Moxie!

2534
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:32,680
Wait, what do you mean I only have five?

2535
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:39,660
Okay, we gotta find the bottles.

2536
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:41,680
Oh my god.

2537
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:43,180
This guy is going through it.

2538
02:44:44,720 --> 02:44:49,040
I think he's got whatever they had in Italy.

2539
02:44:53,560 --> 02:44:55,720
I can't stop hearing their stomachs.

2540
02:44:55,960 --> 02:44:57,360
Oh, I'm taking pictures of them?

2541
02:44:57,420 --> 02:44:58,400
This is messed up.

2542
02:44:59,480 --> 02:45:00,920
Say cheese, sick man.

2543
02:45:01,980 --> 02:45:02,580
Who am I taking?

2544
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:04,020
Oh, a picture of him.

2545
02:45:05,340 --> 02:45:06,880
That would be so messed up.

2546
02:45:08,160 --> 02:45:09,160
Nice and close.

2547
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:12,840
45 points!

2548
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:15,440
Nice.

2549
02:45:17,380 --> 02:45:18,960
Are there any more guys to beat up?

2550
02:45:21,540 --> 02:45:23,460
Was there only two guys in this whole camp?

2551
02:45:25,860 --> 02:45:26,660
Surely not.

2552
02:45:28,080 --> 02:45:29,920
Those are the only two that came running at me though.

2553
02:45:45,500 --> 02:45:46,800
Busy guy.

2554
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:49,820
Anyone in here?

2555
02:45:51,340 --> 02:45:52,540
No one?

2556
02:45:53,760 --> 02:45:55,140
No one in there?

2557
02:45:56,780 --> 02:45:58,420
I'm looking for medicine bottles.

2558
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,180
You guys wouldn't mind, right?

2559
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:10,620
I'm eating my ancient biscottis.

2560
02:46:12,360 --> 02:46:13,320
Nice.

2561
02:46:16,100 --> 02:46:16,620
Hello.

2562
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:20,340
Heard you're going to be in Aura's charity concert, congrats.

2563
02:46:20,680 --> 02:46:20,880
Yeah!

2564
02:46:22,100 --> 02:46:23,080
I will be.

2565
02:46:23,640 --> 02:46:26,120
She invited me, so I was like, yeah.

2566
02:46:26,660 --> 02:46:27,500
Sounds fun.

2567
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:30,640
I will be there.

2568
02:46:32,300 --> 02:46:33,280
New food item.

2569
02:46:33,540 --> 02:46:34,380
We're collecting it all.

2570
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:36,780
This place looks more difficult to find stuff.

2571
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:37,960
Not gonna lie.

2572
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:39,820
Hello.

2573
02:46:41,640 --> 02:46:43,000
Oh, can I have that?

2574
02:46:44,240 --> 02:46:46,040
Oh, I thought it was food.

2575
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:47,000
Oh.

2576
02:46:50,840 --> 02:46:52,220
A prickly pear.

2577
02:46:55,340 --> 02:46:58,080
I thought it was like a...

2578
02:46:58,620 --> 02:47:02,180
I don't... I thought it was like a bread stick or something.

2579
02:47:05,440 --> 02:47:06,980
What do you mean coming through?

2580
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:09,700
You are sitting on your ass.

2581
02:47:10,900 --> 02:47:12,440
Who are you talking to?

2582
02:47:13,600 --> 02:47:15,580
Are we just going to ignore the...

2583
02:47:16,620 --> 02:47:18,680
the two knocked out guys or...

2584
02:47:20,420 --> 02:47:21,560
Are these my footprints?

2585
02:47:23,100 --> 02:47:23,540
No.

2586
02:47:24,320 --> 02:47:26,040
Whose footprints are these?

2587
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:28,860
Bread flute.

2588
02:47:29,800 --> 02:47:30,200
Delicious.

2589
02:47:32,940 --> 02:47:33,840
Melon pon.

2590
02:47:40,960 --> 02:47:42,380
You don't mind, do you sir?

2591
02:47:44,020 --> 02:47:45,100
Gina's out here.

2592
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:48,560
Or maybe she's not.

2593
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,940
I don't know where she is.

2594
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:51,200
Oh, there she is.

2595
02:47:51,200 --> 02:47:52,740
What are you doing, girl?

2596
02:47:54,140 --> 02:47:55,600
I don't think she even knows.

2597
02:47:56,740 --> 02:47:57,860
I miss melon pon.

2598
02:47:57,920 --> 02:47:58,960
I can't get it where I'm at.

2599
02:47:59,380 --> 02:48:01,440
No, you can try and probably make it.

2600
02:48:01,480 --> 02:48:02,520
It doesn't seem very difficult.

2601
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:07,600
What, it's just sugar... something, something mixed together.

2602
02:48:08,900 --> 02:48:12,340
Wow, look at all the bananas and corn.

2603
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:14,340
I'm hungry.

2604
02:48:14,940 --> 02:48:16,060
Gonna have to eat soon.

2605
02:48:19,440 --> 02:48:21,460
Yeah, we're just going to ignore these guys.

2606
02:48:21,640 --> 02:48:22,380
That's fine.

2607
02:48:23,360 --> 02:48:24,600
This camp is mine now.

2608
02:48:30,760 --> 02:48:31,340
Hello.

2609
02:48:34,260 --> 02:48:36,420
Okay, this is how we...

2610
02:48:36,420 --> 02:48:37,360
Great sphinx.

2611
02:48:37,560 --> 02:48:38,800
Oh, spoilers, spoilers.

2612
02:48:40,740 --> 02:48:42,680
So we will get a uniform.

2613
02:48:44,960 --> 02:48:45,540
Eventually.

2614
02:48:47,880 --> 02:48:48,460
Eventually.

2615
02:48:48,480 --> 02:48:48,920
Eventually.

2616
02:48:53,700 --> 02:48:56,180
Then we'll go in and steal all their stuff.

2617
02:49:05,450 --> 02:49:05,850
Sorry.

2618
02:49:10,930 --> 02:49:11,810
Oh, where are they?

2619
02:49:13,270 --> 02:49:14,030
Who's seeing me?

2620
02:49:14,290 --> 02:49:16,070
That guy over there is Hawkeyes?

2621
02:49:19,970 --> 02:49:21,390
It looked like I could go up there.

2622
02:49:21,990 --> 02:49:22,510
Maybe not.

2623
02:49:23,410 --> 02:49:24,010
Bless you.

2624
02:49:24,150 --> 02:49:24,590
Thank you!

2625
02:49:24,690 --> 02:49:27,190
Oh gosh, you guys, I'm getting what they had in Italy.

2626
02:49:27,530 --> 02:49:28,450
Not the Vatican.

2627
02:49:29,210 --> 02:49:30,830
I've got what they had!

2628
02:49:31,330 --> 02:49:32,290
I'm in trouble.

2629
02:49:35,870 --> 02:49:36,850
Who's talking to me?

2630
02:49:37,690 --> 02:49:38,730
I think I'm in trouble.

2631
02:49:44,310 --> 02:49:46,990
It's probably if you speak Italian.

2632
02:49:47,470 --> 02:49:48,230
You get it.

2633
02:49:48,730 --> 02:49:49,750
And I said, No!

2634
02:49:54,990 --> 02:49:57,250
Sorry, I know I'm doing a lot of exploring.

2635
02:49:58,290 --> 02:49:59,750
Is that not bread?

2636
02:50:00,670 --> 02:50:01,750
I'm so hungry.

2637
02:50:07,110 --> 02:50:08,370
What the...

2638
02:50:08,370 --> 02:50:08,830
How?

2639
02:50:09,690 --> 02:50:11,310
Don't bullshit me game.

2640
02:50:12,810 --> 02:50:14,350
Don't bullshit me game.

2641
02:50:15,670 --> 02:50:16,590
There's no way.

2642
02:50:20,760 --> 02:50:22,080
Carry twice the amount of bread!

2643
02:50:22,680 --> 02:50:24,500
Huge, huge if real.

2644
02:50:26,620 --> 02:50:27,400
Bread basket.

2645
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:35,030
Saying naan bread is like saying bread bread.

2646
02:50:35,250 --> 02:50:35,910
Shut up.

2647
02:50:36,210 --> 02:50:37,670
I was just clarifying.

2648
02:50:37,810 --> 02:50:39,530
Since we have someone in the chat named Naan.

2649
02:50:43,080 --> 02:50:43,540
Oh my god.

2650
02:50:44,100 --> 02:50:44,280
No.

2651
02:50:48,820 --> 02:50:49,700
Chai tea moment.

2652
02:50:54,880 --> 02:50:57,420
I'm just trying not to confuse anybody.

2653
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:05,660
I think he can still see me.

2654
02:51:07,310 --> 02:51:07,960
Oh!

2655
02:51:09,540 --> 02:51:10,840
It's...

2656
02:51:11,720 --> 02:51:12,880
It's...

2657
02:51:12,880 --> 02:51:13,920
The kitchen.

2658
02:51:14,640 --> 02:51:15,760
Say cheese!

2659
02:51:16,420 --> 02:51:17,080
Hold on.

2660
02:51:17,860 --> 02:51:18,900
Say cheese!

2661
02:51:19,300 --> 02:51:19,950
Say...

2662
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:21,420
Say...

2663
02:51:21,420 --> 02:51:21,880
Don't...

2664
02:51:22,130 --> 02:51:23,460
Don't facepalm me.

2665
02:51:23,780 --> 02:51:24,720
Say nanos!

2666
02:51:29,400 --> 02:51:30,700
Nanos!

2667
02:51:42,610 --> 02:51:44,110
Can I take any of these?

2668
02:51:44,290 --> 02:51:46,110
Are those loquats?

2669
02:51:51,610 --> 02:51:52,870
This guy is playing Minecraft.

2670
02:51:57,030 --> 02:51:58,490
They do have shoes.

2671
02:52:03,690 --> 02:52:05,070
I think I'm lost now.

2672
02:52:05,330 --> 02:52:07,010
This camp is huge.

2673
02:52:08,070 --> 02:52:09,690
And I haven't found a single medicine bottle.

2674
02:52:09,790 --> 02:52:10,850
Wait, I came over here before.

2675
02:52:12,390 --> 02:52:12,650
Did I?

2676
02:52:13,930 --> 02:52:14,710
I think.

2677
02:52:16,650 --> 02:52:18,490
I haven't found anything to steal.

2678
02:52:20,490 --> 02:52:21,330
Hello, sir.

2679
02:52:22,810 --> 02:52:23,730
Don't mind me.

2680
02:52:26,150 --> 02:52:27,010
Good day to you.

2681
02:52:27,350 --> 02:52:28,270
Good day to you.

2682
02:52:30,510 --> 02:52:31,230
Rough, huh?

2683
02:52:32,410 --> 02:52:32,970
It's okay.

2684
02:52:33,410 --> 02:52:34,170
You'll get through it.

2685
02:52:34,610 --> 02:52:35,210
Don't worry.

2686
02:52:35,390 --> 02:52:35,930
Is she okay?

2687
02:52:38,170 --> 02:52:39,190
I believe in you.

2688
02:52:40,770 --> 02:52:42,350
Just looking for stuff to steal.

2689
02:52:43,110 --> 02:52:43,770
At least we got the...

2690
02:52:43,770 --> 02:52:44,130
Oh, see?

2691
02:52:44,130 --> 02:52:44,790
Like this.

2692
02:52:45,530 --> 02:52:46,190
We're in.

2693
02:52:46,510 --> 02:52:46,810
Cookie.

2694
02:52:49,090 --> 02:52:50,490
She's having a day.

2695
02:52:51,050 --> 02:52:53,090
Really, she's going through it.

2696
02:52:54,910 --> 02:52:55,630
Okay,

2697
02:52:59,110 --> 02:53:00,350
let's go back to her contact.

2698
02:53:01,970 --> 02:53:03,390
Welcome to membership.

2699
02:53:03,790 --> 02:53:04,310
Thank you.

2700
02:53:07,860 --> 02:53:08,560
Cookie.

2701
02:53:14,860 --> 02:53:17,980
We can go through here and then around.

2702
02:53:19,940 --> 02:53:21,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2703
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:23,920
Alright.

2704
02:53:24,580 --> 02:53:25,140
Good job.

2705
02:53:28,740 --> 02:53:29,540
Camel.

2706
02:53:34,550 --> 02:53:35,250
Okey dokey.

2707
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:43,820
She's beautiful.

2708
02:54:04,560 --> 02:54:05,840
Famous archaeologist.

2709
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:08,360
I like her glasses a lot.

2710
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:10,120
She's got a mole, too.

2711
02:54:23,880 --> 02:54:25,480
Am I sensing...?

2712
02:54:33,360 --> 02:54:35,180
I'm glad to hear you say that.

2713
02:54:36,480 --> 02:54:37,600
Why, thank you.

2714
02:54:40,200 --> 02:54:42,460
She doesn't look like a narwhal.

2715
02:54:42,760 --> 02:54:44,240
Oh, have a look around, Dr. Jones.

2716
02:54:44,260 --> 02:54:46,340
She's just not in the water enough.

2717
02:54:48,060 --> 02:54:49,100
It's nawal.

2718
02:54:49,420 --> 02:54:50,640
Not narwhal.

2719
02:54:51,220 --> 02:54:53,300
You have a very sharp eye for quality.

2720
02:54:54,520 --> 02:54:57,280
Just trinkets I've collected on my travels.

2721
02:54:57,720 --> 02:54:58,780
Thank you, Daniel.

2722
02:54:59,400 --> 02:55:02,320
The Nazis think it's a conduit of some kind of power, correct?

2723
02:55:03,140 --> 02:55:04,280
Boss certainly does.

2724
02:55:05,300 --> 02:55:07,580
He believes it will secure his place in history.

2725
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:10,780
Everything's a competition with that guy.

2726
02:55:10,980 --> 02:55:13,240
I'm choosing my sister to cross the finish line.

2727
02:55:15,340 --> 02:55:17,280
My roommate's senses are tingling.

2728
02:55:17,500 --> 02:55:19,180
Everything is predestined and pre-written.

2729
02:55:19,920 --> 02:55:21,340
As the Egyptians would say.

2730
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:26,960
Snakes!

2731
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:29,220
Mind-feeding of Cyrus, Dr. Jones.

2732
02:55:29,220 --> 02:55:31,880
I don't think he's hungry.

2733
02:55:32,940 --> 02:55:35,100
Scared of snakes, Dr. Jones?

2734
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:37,140
Must be a problem in your line of work.

2735
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:39,540
Why'd it have to be snakes?

2736
02:55:39,560 --> 02:55:43,220
Nothing would make me happier than feeding your snake, David Wall.

2737
02:55:45,120 --> 02:55:45,880
Oh, are we actually?

2738
02:55:46,080 --> 02:55:47,080
Feed Osiris!

2739
02:55:48,220 --> 02:55:49,900
Give him just a little snack.

2740
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:51,180
That should be enough.

2741
02:55:51,380 --> 02:55:52,280
A little snake?

2742
02:55:53,060 --> 02:55:54,080
A little snerk?

2743
02:55:57,700 --> 02:55:58,880
I want to see him.

2744
02:55:59,300 --> 02:56:00,200
He's not in there.

2745
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:01,060
Oh, there he is!

2746
02:56:01,080 --> 02:56:02,700
Oh my god, he's precious!

2747
02:56:03,860 --> 02:56:05,220
Look at that little guy.

2748
02:56:05,680 --> 02:56:06,620
His little tongue.

2749
02:56:07,340 --> 02:56:09,140
Oh my god, he's so cute!

2750
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:12,140
Hold on with the tongue.

2751
02:56:12,320 --> 02:56:12,480
Ow!

2752
02:56:12,980 --> 02:56:13,180
Dang it.

2753
02:56:15,140 --> 02:56:18,440
What do you mean it's no good?

2754
02:56:19,820 --> 02:56:21,120
I'm trying, Indy.

2755
02:56:24,160 --> 02:56:25,100
I'm trying.

2756
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:28,720
Maybe you're the one who's like, I don't want to get closer.

2757
02:56:30,800 --> 02:56:32,100
How is that any better?

2758
02:56:32,880 --> 02:56:35,000
You don't even see him.

2759
02:56:36,200 --> 02:56:36,780
Charming.

2760
02:56:40,060 --> 02:56:41,400
Is this his food?

2761
02:56:46,460 --> 02:56:54,200
He looks terrified.

2762
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:57,360
One of my spies smuggled this out of the Nazi compound.

2763
02:56:57,820 --> 02:56:59,800
Oh, I thought he ate the peppers.

2764
02:57:00,520 --> 02:57:02,360
That doesn't seem like a very snake food.

2765
02:57:02,640 --> 02:57:03,700
Signed by Adolf Hitler.

2766
02:57:04,180 --> 02:57:05,340
An obnoxious little twit.

2767
02:57:06,900 --> 02:57:08,300
Dr. Laura Lombardi.

2768
02:57:09,080 --> 02:57:10,640
She's on the list of the participants?

2769
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:13,180
Couldn't find any description of this experiment.

2770
02:57:13,180 --> 02:57:14,260
Like how you see a shadow in the background?

2771
02:57:14,460 --> 02:57:15,600
My German is a tad rusty.

2772
02:57:16,580 --> 02:57:19,020
Where did you get yourself into, Laura?

2773
02:57:19,640 --> 02:57:23,480
She was so absorbed in her work when we lived in Berlin.

2774
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:25,460
She was never really present.

2775
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:27,140
She never was in the moment.

2776
02:57:28,340 --> 02:57:29,700
What are you trying to say, huh?

2777
02:57:30,460 --> 02:57:33,460
Well, I'm still here for her.

2778
02:57:33,940 --> 02:57:36,020
Doing everything I can, even though...

2779
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:40,220
Voss.

2780
02:57:41,340 --> 02:57:43,540
Has an office in the Nazi compound.

2781
02:57:46,100 --> 02:57:49,000
Perhaps we can find more information there.

2782
02:57:49,660 --> 02:57:51,060
Is he okay?

2783
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:55,480
Let's give him the beetle.

2784
02:57:59,920 --> 02:58:01,660
This is how he dies.

2785
02:58:05,080 --> 02:58:06,400
Welcome to the membership.

2786
02:58:06,500 --> 02:58:07,380
Thank you.

2787
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:17,080
I mean your snake is a little aggressive.

2788
02:58:22,700 --> 02:58:23,680
The what?

2789
02:58:24,660 --> 02:58:26,580
This room is so cozy.

2790
02:58:32,620 --> 02:58:34,820
I know what she means.

2791
02:58:41,790 --> 02:58:43,740
I know what she means.

2792
02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:45,020
It's just, you know...

2793
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:50,660
Oh god, no.

2794
02:58:55,240 --> 02:58:56,040
Wait,

2795
02:58:59,340 --> 02:58:59,420
what?

2796
02:59:12,200 --> 02:59:13,580
Geomantic analysis.

2797
02:59:14,420 --> 02:59:17,080
Observations on the geomantic properties of the pyramids.

2798
02:59:17,080 --> 02:59:21,020
The alignment of the two smaller pyramids in relation to the Great Pyramid must be significant.

2799
02:59:21,260 --> 02:59:23,900
Notice the number of miniature pyramids and how they are arranged.

2800
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:25,280
A very peculiar pattern.

2801
02:59:25,900 --> 02:59:29,820
Did the ancient Egyptians see some sort of divine properties in this location?

2802
02:59:30,220 --> 02:59:33,580
What secrets is the ground beneath the hot sands we walk on hiding?

2803
02:59:34,560 --> 02:59:36,080
Okay, I'm gonna just take your...

2804
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:40,880
I'm just gonna take your diary entry.

2805
02:59:41,500 --> 02:59:41,980
Who's this?

2806
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:44,840
Scarlet Arrow.

2807
02:59:50,840 --> 02:59:51,440
What?

2808
02:59:53,500 --> 02:59:55,440
Wait, no, you didn't explain it.

2809
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,200
You didn't finish saying it.

2810
03:00:04,840 --> 03:00:07,000
I think she's murderous.

2811
03:00:07,500 --> 03:00:08,120
Yeah, maybe.

2812
03:00:08,780 --> 03:00:09,960
Maybe she's just murderous.

2813
03:00:10,000 --> 03:00:10,400
Who's this?

2814
03:00:18,120 --> 03:00:20,540
British Egyptologist Margaret.

2815
03:00:24,460 --> 03:00:25,720
A lovely lady.

2816
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:26,800
I just took a picture.

2817
03:00:26,980 --> 03:00:29,580
I'm just taking all your stuff, honestly.

2818
03:00:32,910 --> 03:00:35,210
Alright, time to observe this rubbing.

2819
03:00:42,330 --> 03:00:44,050
Yeah, that's what she just said.

2820
03:00:48,690 --> 03:00:52,170
Cursed with a terrible power, according to the old Egyptian legend.

2821
03:00:52,730 --> 03:00:53,130
Grapes.

2822
03:00:53,450 --> 03:00:55,290
It's been lost for thousands of years.

2823
03:00:55,410 --> 03:00:56,190
No one's known where to look.

2824
03:00:56,190 --> 03:00:56,990
I want some grapes.

2825
03:00:57,290 --> 03:00:59,790
So why does Vos think that the idol is here in Giza?

2826
03:01:00,890 --> 03:01:02,690
Perhaps he thinks old Khufu had it.

2827
03:01:03,730 --> 03:01:06,090
Khufu built the Great Pyramid as his personal tomb.

2828
03:01:06,210 --> 03:01:07,470
If he did have the idol, then he would...

2829
03:01:07,470 --> 03:01:09,490
He would want to hide its power from the world.

2830
03:01:20,810 --> 03:01:22,030
The power of the stone.

2831
03:01:24,050 --> 03:01:25,190
Dame Nawal, you're a genius.

2832
03:01:26,070 --> 03:01:26,610
Am I?

2833
03:01:26,610 --> 03:01:28,230
A cat mummy.

2834
03:01:28,890 --> 03:01:29,310
Sorry.

2835
03:01:30,810 --> 03:01:33,570
The stones at the Great Circle were found inside various ancient relics.

2836
03:01:33,690 --> 03:01:37,270
Which could mean the idol of Ra contains another one of those stones.

2837
03:01:38,210 --> 03:01:38,730
Bravo!

2838
03:01:46,540 --> 03:01:50,100
I take it you won't just idly wait here for your work passes.

2839
03:01:51,220 --> 03:01:52,420
Yeah, we'll leave.

2840
03:01:52,460 --> 03:01:56,960
An agent of mine purloined this excavation map from the Nazi camp.

2841
03:01:56,980 --> 03:01:57,760
Oh yeah, thank you.

2842
03:01:57,760 --> 03:02:01,240
I'll give you an updated view of the surroundings here in Giza.

2843
03:02:01,580 --> 03:02:02,900
You sound so sarcastic.

2844
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:06,480
Why is the map in this extravagant box?

2845
03:02:09,180 --> 03:02:10,100
Thank you.

2846
03:02:10,660 --> 03:02:12,460
You could have just given me the paper.

2847
03:02:13,520 --> 03:02:14,260
Detailed map.

2848
03:02:14,720 --> 03:02:15,240
Thank you.

2849
03:02:21,870 --> 03:02:25,710
Wasn't Khufu's grave robbed within a few decades of his death though?

2850
03:02:25,710 --> 03:02:28,530
I can use this to listen to the Nazi's recommendations.

2851
03:02:28,890 --> 03:02:29,850
Historical fiction.

2852
03:02:29,990 --> 03:02:30,810
Splendid idea.

2853
03:02:30,990 --> 03:02:31,670
Be my guest.

2854
03:02:32,490 --> 03:02:33,710
Don't think about it.

2855
03:02:33,750 --> 03:02:34,850
I don't know if that's true or not.

2856
03:02:35,030 --> 03:02:38,390
But if it is true, just don't worry about it.

2857
03:02:45,310 --> 03:02:47,170
That was his decoy grave.

2858
03:03:03,490 --> 03:03:05,510
Yeah, it's a video game.

2859
03:03:14,670 --> 03:03:16,030
Aw,

2860
03:03:25,350 --> 03:03:30,270
the music.

2861
03:03:32,490 --> 03:03:33,550
I'll do my best.

2862
03:03:34,690 --> 03:03:36,730
As long as I end up in a museum.

2863
03:03:38,070 --> 03:03:39,010
Take yourself serious.

2864
03:03:39,870 --> 03:03:41,190
I belong in a museum.

2865
03:03:41,410 --> 03:03:52,490
Oh god.

2866
03:04:02,490 --> 03:04:03,410
Stele number 1.

2867
03:04:03,550 --> 03:04:04,390
Stele number 2.

2868
03:04:04,950 --> 03:04:05,970
Is in the Sphinx.

2869
03:04:06,250 --> 03:04:07,030
Stele number 3.

2870
03:04:07,730 --> 03:04:08,510
Beneath... Oh wait.

2871
03:04:08,630 --> 03:04:10,150
Stele number 2 is east of the Sphinx.

2872
03:04:10,250 --> 03:04:11,490
Stele number 3 is...

2873
03:04:12,110 --> 03:04:13,130
Beneath the Sphinx.

2874
03:04:13,250 --> 03:04:14,290
Stele number 4.

2875
03:04:15,630 --> 03:04:16,590
West of the village.

2876
03:04:18,730 --> 03:04:19,850
Stele number 5.

2877
03:04:21,050 --> 03:04:22,250
South of the mortuary temple.

2878
03:04:23,150 --> 03:04:24,170
X marked flag.

2879
03:04:25,530 --> 03:04:26,350
Hello Minto Jones.

2880
03:04:26,430 --> 03:04:29,490
I officially turned into a young old man today.

2881
03:04:30,490 --> 03:04:31,530
Gosuu!

2882
03:04:33,090 --> 03:04:35,670
Can you wish these old bones a happy birthday please and thank you?

2883
03:04:35,890 --> 03:04:36,670
Of course!

2884
03:04:37,370 --> 03:04:40,810
Happy birthday to you.

2885
03:04:41,170 --> 03:04:43,850
Happy birthday to you.

2886
03:04:44,210 --> 03:04:47,470
Happy birthday dear Gosuu.

2887
03:04:48,750 --> 03:04:52,570
Happy birthday to you.

2888
03:04:54,130 --> 03:04:54,490
Hey!

2889
03:04:58,720 --> 03:05:00,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2890
03:05:01,800 --> 03:05:03,480
Since we grabbed this...

2891
03:05:04,600 --> 03:05:05,460
I'm gonna be right back.

2892
03:05:05,520 --> 03:05:06,760
I'm gonna go grab some food real quick.

2893
03:05:06,840 --> 03:05:09,980
We're gonna have a quick little dinner intermission.

2894
03:05:10,360 --> 03:05:11,540
I won't eat for so long though.

2895
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:13,880
I'm just gonna grab the food and...

2896
03:05:13,880 --> 03:05:14,340
Eat a bit.

2897
03:05:15,760 --> 03:05:16,760
And stuff, stuff, stuff.

2898
03:05:17,800 --> 03:05:19,060
I'll be right back.

2899
03:05:19,200 --> 03:05:20,180
Food break, food break.

2900
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:21,660
But I'll be eating here.

2901
03:05:22,040 --> 03:05:23,360
We'll talk and stuff.

2902
03:05:23,740 --> 03:05:24,820
I'm just gonna go grab it.

2903
03:05:24,820 --> 03:05:25,880
And some more drink.

2904
03:05:26,240 --> 03:05:26,860
Some more tea.

2905
03:05:27,340 --> 03:05:28,140
Okay, okay, okay.

2906
03:05:28,500 --> 03:05:28,980
BRB.

2907
03:08:00,270 --> 03:08:01,230
I'm back.

2908
03:08:02,410 --> 03:08:03,830
I have to figure out where I put this.

2909
03:08:04,670 --> 03:08:07,810
When I was out earlier I got myself a taco bowl.

2910
03:08:09,090 --> 03:08:10,050
And now...

2911
03:08:10,050 --> 03:08:11,230
I don't know where to put it.

2912
03:08:16,230 --> 03:08:16,830
There.

2913
03:08:17,150 --> 03:08:17,410
Okay.

2914
03:08:19,630 --> 03:08:20,370
Welcome back.

2915
03:08:20,430 --> 03:08:21,230
Thank you.

2916
03:08:21,690 --> 03:08:22,710
A taco bowl.

2917
03:08:23,690 --> 03:08:24,650
Not Taco Bell.

2918
03:08:24,870 --> 03:08:25,950
Taco Be-Bowl.

2919
03:08:28,590 --> 03:08:29,750
How's the game so far?

2920
03:08:29,810 --> 03:08:30,270
I heard it was dope.

2921
03:08:30,330 --> 03:08:31,250
It's so fun!

2922
03:08:31,910 --> 03:08:32,770
It's so good.

2923
03:08:33,630 --> 03:08:34,430
It's so silly.

2924
03:08:35,010 --> 03:08:36,110
In all the best ways.

2925
03:08:44,250 --> 03:08:45,170
Taco Bowl.

2926
03:08:45,630 --> 03:08:48,190
I love these radio sounds in my right ear.

2927
03:08:50,090 --> 03:08:50,830
Very nice.

2928
03:08:50,950 --> 03:08:52,170
I'm just gonna take a quick...

2929
03:08:52,170 --> 03:08:55,430
Quick little break so I don't get super...

2930
03:08:55,430 --> 03:08:57,450
Super crazy hungry and like...

2931
03:08:57,450 --> 03:08:58,030
Ah, I'm shaking.

2932
03:09:03,630 --> 03:09:05,550
It is very India.

2933
03:09:10,950 --> 03:09:11,470
Very...

2934
03:09:11,470 --> 03:09:12,390
Indiana Jones.

2935
03:09:13,230 --> 03:09:15,010
Hold on, I'm gonna go away from this area.

2936
03:09:23,490 --> 03:09:24,010
Okay.

2937
03:09:29,430 --> 03:09:29,830
Okay.

2938
03:09:35,510 --> 03:09:36,650
Hold on, I'm eating.

2939
03:09:36,810 --> 03:09:38,750
Oh no, she's gonna not shut up, is she?

2940
03:09:39,810 --> 03:09:41,030
She's not gonna shut up, is she?

2941
03:09:43,350 --> 03:09:44,950
We named the dog Mint?

2942
03:09:46,290 --> 03:09:47,430
Thanks for all the streams this year, Minto.

2943
03:09:47,810 --> 03:09:48,050
What?

2944
03:09:49,350 --> 03:09:50,450
Oh my god.

2945
03:09:53,590 --> 03:09:54,190
What?

2946
03:09:58,190 --> 03:10:01,310
That's the second time someone's named their dog after me.

2947
03:10:02,750 --> 03:10:03,350
Yay!

2948
03:10:07,650 --> 03:10:08,770
I wanna see...

2949
03:10:08,770 --> 03:10:10,470
I wanna see...

2950
03:10:11,130 --> 03:10:11,730
Doggo...

2951
03:10:11,730 --> 03:10:12,130
Dog...

2952
03:10:12,130 --> 03:10:13,230
Dog...Minto.

2953
03:10:13,910 --> 03:10:14,650
I would like to see him.

2954
03:10:17,010 --> 03:10:18,910
Okay, India, I get it.

2955
03:10:20,030 --> 03:10:21,290
God, I'm coming.

2956
03:10:21,470 --> 03:10:22,910
Hold on, I can't...

2957
03:10:25,980 --> 03:10:27,660
You're making a real racket, you know that?

2958
03:10:31,700 --> 03:10:33,740
I'll mute so you can hear the game.

2959
03:10:41,710 --> 03:10:42,370
That's the boss.

2960
03:10:55,410 --> 03:10:55,490
Come.

2961
03:10:57,570 --> 03:10:58,190
Good.

2962
03:11:11,200 --> 03:11:14,150
Va seems very concerned about this excavation.

2963
03:11:14,970 --> 03:11:15,930
What is he searching for?

2964
03:11:16,590 --> 03:11:18,850
He said the Sanctuary of the Guardians.

2965
03:11:19,530 --> 03:11:19,810
Huh?

2966
03:11:21,180 --> 03:11:23,850
Maybe they were guardians of the Idol of Ra.

2967
03:11:23,850 --> 03:11:26,950
We have to investigate before he returns to the site.

2968
03:11:32,500 --> 03:11:33,700
What was she doing that for?

2969
03:11:36,960 --> 03:11:38,920
Do you have a question, ma'am?

2970
03:11:41,220 --> 03:11:41,980
Ma'am?

2971
03:11:46,810 --> 03:11:48,490
Alright, we got fieldwork.

2972
03:11:49,470 --> 03:11:50,250
Mr. Yoga.

2973
03:11:52,270 --> 03:11:53,390
New adventure!

2974
03:11:55,830 --> 03:11:57,150
Can I play this?

2975
03:11:57,330 --> 03:11:59,030
Does it have to be a weapon thing?

2976
03:12:01,490 --> 03:12:04,250
I was going to play it.

2977
03:12:08,250 --> 03:12:08,890
Alright.

2978
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:11,090
So, let's see.

2979
03:12:11,350 --> 03:12:14,070
Sanctuary of the Guardians and then the Idol of Ra.

2980
03:12:15,230 --> 03:12:17,930
Remedy for all the field notes.

2981
03:12:19,870 --> 03:12:22,010
So, explore the Sphinx dig.

2982
03:12:23,250 --> 03:12:24,470
And we got to take photographs.

2983
03:12:27,470 --> 03:12:28,110
Okay.

2984
03:12:30,070 --> 03:12:32,950
I am still munch-crunching, so...

2985
03:12:36,710 --> 03:12:38,830
I'll do that a bit first.

2986
03:12:38,950 --> 03:12:39,950
And we can have this...

2987
03:12:41,410 --> 03:12:44,570
You think those guys got up and walked away?

2988
03:12:45,090 --> 03:12:46,010
You think those guys are back?

2989
03:12:47,330 --> 03:12:50,530
I will have a munch-crunch and we can enjoy this view.

2990
03:12:51,350 --> 03:12:51,830
Mmm.

2991
03:12:58,140 --> 03:13:01,340
Yeah, time to learn some Arabic from whatever they are saying to us.

2992
03:13:06,240 --> 03:13:08,460
I'll be able to say, good day to you.

2993
03:13:11,760 --> 03:13:12,240
Okay.

2994
03:13:14,140 --> 03:13:15,580
Can we stop by McDonald's?

2995
03:13:15,640 --> 03:13:15,880
No!

2996
03:13:16,820 --> 03:13:18,000
Why is my game drifting?

2997
03:13:20,040 --> 03:13:21,540
I'm not touching my controller.

2998
03:13:33,150 --> 03:13:34,030
Controller drift.

2999
03:13:34,190 --> 03:13:35,270
Stick drift real.

3000
03:13:35,950 --> 03:13:36,650
Oh my god!

3001
03:13:36,730 --> 03:13:38,870
Oh, this lady is fighting through the sand.

3002
03:13:49,940 --> 03:13:51,500
No, I want to see the pyramid.

3003
03:13:53,080 --> 03:13:54,240
Let's see if it happens again.

3004
03:13:59,500 --> 03:14:00,200
Oh no, it's fine now.

3005
03:14:04,380 --> 03:14:05,560
This guy is frozen.

3006
03:14:09,260 --> 03:14:09,900
He is...

3007
03:14:12,180 --> 03:14:15,300
He is playing a game of red light, green light.

3008
03:14:15,760 --> 03:14:17,420
And because I'm looking at him, he won't go.

3009
03:14:20,180 --> 03:14:21,200
I'm not looking.

3010
03:14:22,320 --> 03:14:23,260
Here, I'll look away.

3011
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:23,820
I'll look away.

3012
03:14:26,420 --> 03:14:27,260
Green light!

3013
03:14:31,700 --> 03:14:32,460
Red light.

3014
03:14:32,920 --> 03:14:33,060
Oh!

3015
03:14:36,920 --> 03:14:37,720
Weeping angel.

3016
03:14:37,720 --> 03:14:37,760
Weeping angel.

3017
03:14:44,970 --> 03:14:46,290
I don't know if he is okay.

3018
03:14:47,870 --> 03:14:49,010
I'll go check on him.

3019
03:14:50,090 --> 03:14:50,550
Sir?

3020
03:14:51,770 --> 03:14:52,630
Oh my god!

3021
03:14:52,690 --> 03:14:54,330
Oh, I thought he was about to drop dead.

3022
03:14:58,090 --> 03:15:00,510
He says, I don't want this job anymore.

3023
03:15:04,150 --> 03:15:05,070
I don't...Oh!

3024
03:15:06,750 --> 03:15:10,670
Did you just...Did you just take his broom?

3025
03:15:18,760 --> 03:15:21,840
He's like, well, he's not gonna use it again.

3026
03:15:22,560 --> 03:15:23,940
I guess I will.

3027
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:25,780
Oh my gosh.

3028
03:15:25,880 --> 03:15:28,200
Okay, sphinx dig site is...

3029
03:15:30,920 --> 03:15:31,660
Oh!

3030
03:15:34,910 --> 03:15:35,570
Oh!

3031
03:15:38,190 --> 03:15:38,370
Oh!

3032
03:15:40,170 --> 03:15:41,410
Behind there, right?

3033
03:15:42,010 --> 03:15:43,050
Okay, we'll go behind.

3034
03:15:43,590 --> 03:15:44,590
We'll go another way.

3035
03:15:47,510 --> 03:15:50,130
It's the broom that causes you to...

3036
03:15:51,450 --> 03:15:53,150
freeze in time.

3037
03:15:53,410 --> 03:15:54,210
Mystery note.

3038
03:15:55,050 --> 03:15:55,770
Wanted poster.

3039
03:15:55,870 --> 03:16:02,310
Two French speaking men disguised as diggers who have been breaking into the excavation to steal artifacts.

3040
03:16:02,690 --> 03:16:06,250
One of them was seen heading southeast on the road from the workers camp.

3041
03:16:06,430 --> 03:16:10,790
If you have any information of these men, please inform a guard or foreman at the excavation.

3042
03:16:10,930 --> 03:16:11,790
Oh my god!

3043
03:16:15,050 --> 03:16:18,070
Oh, does this not give me...I know she gave me a new mystery.

3044
03:16:19,310 --> 03:16:20,750
I guess I'm gonna go find them.

3045
03:16:21,830 --> 03:16:22,770
It's not my job.

3046
03:16:24,210 --> 03:16:26,170
I guess it will turn out to be.

3047
03:16:28,590 --> 03:16:31,210
That looks like excavation site...

3048
03:16:33,530 --> 03:16:35,650
over there, over yonder.

3049
03:16:36,950 --> 03:16:38,630
Yes, I am correct.

3050
03:16:39,730 --> 03:16:40,570
In my assumption.

3051
03:16:42,950 --> 03:16:45,890
How do I wanna sneak past the guards?

3052
03:16:51,710 --> 03:16:52,770
I'll just run.

3053
03:16:58,300 --> 03:16:58,740
No.

3054
03:16:59,620 --> 03:17:01,040
Oh, these are also guys.

3055
03:17:02,320 --> 03:17:02,980
I'm running.

3056
03:17:03,540 --> 03:17:06,140
I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running, I'm running.

3057
03:17:07,700 --> 03:17:08,140
Yep.

3058
03:17:09,640 --> 03:17:09,940
Anyway.

3059
03:17:11,880 --> 03:17:12,520
Good day to you.

3060
03:17:19,730 --> 03:17:20,170
Alright.

3061
03:17:21,770 --> 03:17:23,750
Here, we have to...

3062
03:17:25,290 --> 03:17:27,970
We have to take photos, is that what it was?

3063
03:17:27,970 --> 03:17:28,190
Yeah,

3064
03:17:33,750 --> 03:17:36,750
they need sunglasses, that's why they can't tell anything.

3065
03:17:37,570 --> 03:17:38,510
Stupid heads.

3066
03:17:40,990 --> 03:17:41,490
Oh.

3067
03:17:42,630 --> 03:17:44,590
Nah, you didn't hear anything.

3068
03:17:45,810 --> 03:17:47,950
If you did, I'm gonna punch you out.

3069
03:17:48,110 --> 03:17:48,870
I'm gonna punch you out.

3070
03:17:49,490 --> 03:17:49,930
Where'd he go?

3071
03:17:50,110 --> 03:17:50,630
Oh, shit.

3072
03:17:54,770 --> 03:17:55,970
What the hell?

3073
03:18:02,430 --> 03:18:03,230
Yeah.

3074
03:18:04,290 --> 03:18:05,090
Curious.

3075
03:18:07,370 --> 03:18:08,170
Curious.

3076
03:18:08,910 --> 03:18:10,270
Curious, indeed.

3077
03:18:11,150 --> 03:18:12,210
Kiara was here.

3078
03:18:14,190 --> 03:18:14,990
Raiders.

3079
03:18:15,150 --> 03:18:16,250
Oh, thank you!

3080
03:18:16,690 --> 03:18:17,690
Wait, did Kiara raid me?

3081
03:18:18,950 --> 03:18:19,350
Hello!

3082
03:18:20,170 --> 03:18:21,730
I'm playing Indiana Jones.

3083
03:18:22,130 --> 03:18:23,370
And I just...

3084
03:18:24,070 --> 03:18:25,610
Nah, nah.

3085
03:18:25,750 --> 03:18:26,390
I need a weapon.

3086
03:18:28,850 --> 03:18:31,590
We're searching for the great circle!

3087
03:18:36,470 --> 03:18:37,950
I'm being really sneaky.

3088
03:18:38,990 --> 03:18:39,450
Trust.

3089
03:18:39,910 --> 03:18:41,170
Trust I'm being so sneaky.

3090
03:18:41,450 --> 03:18:42,190
Grab that, grab that.

3091
03:18:42,390 --> 03:18:43,130
Good job, good job, good job.

3092
03:18:44,250 --> 03:18:44,890
Good job, good job.

3093
03:18:46,950 --> 03:18:47,530
Hi, Cappy!

3094
03:18:50,330 --> 03:18:52,050
What was Kiara streaming today?

3095
03:18:53,390 --> 03:18:54,310
I looked.

3096
03:18:54,310 --> 03:18:57,490
I'd like to not see her streaming.

3097
03:18:58,490 --> 03:18:59,250
Oh my god.

3098
03:18:59,790 --> 03:19:01,130
Where's the other guy at?

3099
03:19:02,990 --> 03:19:03,950
Oh, they're both here.

3100
03:19:04,170 --> 03:19:04,770
Okay, just kidding.

3101
03:19:06,430 --> 03:19:08,310
Maybe I need to just...

3102
03:19:10,170 --> 03:19:11,630
There's three guys.

3103
03:19:16,110 --> 03:19:17,610
I could drop that.

3104
03:19:17,730 --> 03:19:18,130
Shoot.

3105
03:19:18,370 --> 03:19:19,130
Grab my thing.

3106
03:19:21,050 --> 03:19:21,930
Oh, a member is watching!

3107
03:19:22,070 --> 03:19:22,510
Oh my god, did he?

3108
03:19:22,570 --> 03:19:23,150
I was gonna...

3109
03:19:32,970 --> 03:19:33,690
Oh shit.

3110
03:19:35,790 --> 03:19:36,710
Grab that!

3111
03:19:44,030 --> 03:19:45,410
Oh my god, there's a lot of guys.

3112
03:19:47,630 --> 03:19:48,950
Why are you so weak?

3113
03:19:49,450 --> 03:19:49,710
Die!

3114
03:19:49,870 --> 03:19:50,070
Die!

3115
03:19:50,310 --> 03:19:50,310
Die!

3116
03:19:52,350 --> 03:19:53,270
I'm not gonna live.

3117
03:19:53,370 --> 03:19:53,750
I'm not gonna live.

3118
03:19:55,610 --> 03:19:56,070
Die!

3119
03:19:56,430 --> 03:19:56,710
Die!

3120
03:19:56,870 --> 03:19:57,130
Die!

3121
03:19:57,150 --> 03:19:57,530
Grab the thing!

3122
03:20:00,010 --> 03:20:00,250
My hat!

3123
03:20:00,510 --> 03:20:01,390
Where's my hat?

3124
03:20:01,810 --> 03:20:02,410
My hat!

3125
03:20:03,510 --> 03:20:04,270
Lucky hat!

3126
03:20:04,490 --> 03:20:05,050
Lucky hat!

3127
03:20:13,220 --> 03:20:14,280
My hat is here.

3128
03:20:18,570 --> 03:20:20,170
I think we took care of the...

3129
03:20:23,210 --> 03:20:24,910
I think we took care of it.

3130
03:20:38,140 --> 03:20:39,820
I'm also half eating dinner, so...

3131
03:20:50,500 --> 03:20:51,720
There's some more guys.

3132
03:20:53,200 --> 03:20:54,440
No, that's not what I meant to do.

3133
03:20:54,960 --> 03:20:55,940
But for now we're good.

3134
03:20:57,520 --> 03:20:59,140
This game is very fun, you guys.

3135
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:00,640
It feels very Indiana Jones.

3136
03:21:01,820 --> 03:21:03,040
If you're like, how is this game?

3137
03:21:04,180 --> 03:21:04,800
It's very fun.

3138
03:21:09,320 --> 03:21:11,760
For raiders, the fedora is like a phoenix feather.

3139
03:21:12,620 --> 03:21:12,940
Yeah.

3140
03:21:13,980 --> 03:21:14,700
It is.

3141
03:21:14,840 --> 03:21:15,460
It's like...

3142
03:21:15,460 --> 03:21:17,400
Every time you go up...

3143
03:21:17,400 --> 03:21:18,480
Alright, let's eat some bread.

3144
03:21:19,220 --> 03:21:20,020
Eat some bread.

3145
03:21:22,560 --> 03:21:25,040
Let's eat some fruit.

3146
03:21:27,100 --> 03:21:29,780
We're getting extra stamina, extra health.

3147
03:21:31,020 --> 03:21:31,940
Oh yeah, baby.

3148
03:21:32,480 --> 03:21:32,920
Oh yeah.

3149
03:21:33,020 --> 03:21:33,880
Alright, now we're here.

3150
03:21:34,360 --> 03:21:35,500
We gotta take some photos.

3151
03:21:36,120 --> 03:21:37,300
I'm not quite sure of what.

3152
03:21:39,060 --> 03:21:40,600
Oh boy, that's kinda scary.

3153
03:21:41,620 --> 03:21:42,980
I'm gonna look around first.

3154
03:21:45,700 --> 03:21:48,480
I felt we held our own pretty well there, I'm not gonna lie.

3155
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:51,020
I think we did a good job.

3156
03:21:52,540 --> 03:21:54,440
I think we really Indiana Jones-ed it.

3157
03:21:56,840 --> 03:21:57,960
What is that?

3158
03:21:59,500 --> 03:22:00,080
Minecraft?

3159
03:22:01,780 --> 03:22:03,240
What is howling?

3160
03:22:03,980 --> 03:22:04,280
Minecraft?

3161
03:22:07,240 --> 03:22:09,120
Oh, that doesn't look...

3162
03:22:09,920 --> 03:22:11,240
I'm as infected as...

3163
03:22:12,600 --> 03:22:13,360
Yeah.

3164
03:22:15,440 --> 03:22:17,080
India, I wouldn't crawl through there.

3165
03:22:34,850 --> 03:22:37,690
I've traveled here from...

3166
03:22:37,690 --> 03:22:40,290
On the east bank of the Nile.

3167
03:22:42,130 --> 03:22:43,550
How do you pronounce this?

3168
03:22:47,170 --> 03:22:48,510
How do you pronounce this?

3169
03:22:51,770 --> 03:22:53,930
Was as glorious as it was mysterious.

3170
03:22:54,170 --> 03:22:56,570
Hundreds of pyramids containing secrets I tremble to imagine.

3171
03:22:57,030 --> 03:22:59,030
I discovered one such secret in a tomb.

3172
03:22:59,030 --> 03:23:01,150
A wall covered in beautiful...

3173
03:23:01,150 --> 03:23:02,070
Meroe.

3174
03:23:11,410 --> 03:23:12,370
So, Meroe.

3175
03:23:14,870 --> 03:23:16,490
A Meroitic script.

3176
03:23:16,610 --> 03:23:19,230
Having no knowledge of this language, I attempted to interpret some of the symbols.

3177
03:23:19,550 --> 03:23:20,490
One of them caught my eye.

3178
03:23:21,190 --> 03:23:25,290
I had seen it before in a Coptic manuscript found in Alexandria.

3179
03:23:25,530 --> 03:23:26,710
The Idol of Ra!

3180
03:23:27,110 --> 03:23:27,770
Oh my goodness.

3181
03:23:27,770 --> 03:23:32,870
Frankly, I searched for other clues in the myriad of hieroglyphs.

3182
03:23:33,970 --> 03:23:34,850
And there it was.

3183
03:23:34,970 --> 03:23:36,850
Three pyramids, one taller than the others.

3184
03:23:37,210 --> 03:23:38,770
The tomb of King Khufu.

3185
03:23:39,790 --> 03:23:44,750
That is how I knew the legendary Idol of Ra had to be buried somewhere in Giza.

3186
03:23:45,630 --> 03:23:47,650
They say it is made out of pure gold.

3187
03:23:47,910 --> 03:23:51,450
The sun has disappeared beyond the horizon.

3188
03:23:51,450 --> 03:23:58,330
It's time to sleep, though I fear I shall find it difficult with all the strange noises I've been hearing at night.

3189
03:23:59,550 --> 03:24:00,690
Been here a while.

3190
03:24:01,630 --> 03:24:02,590
Where's my...

3191
03:24:03,250 --> 03:24:04,170
Where's my weapon?

3192
03:24:04,710 --> 03:24:05,510
Oh, I left it.

3193
03:24:06,370 --> 03:24:06,650
Alright.

3194
03:24:07,030 --> 03:24:07,970
I got my fists.

3195
03:24:09,990 --> 03:24:11,110
Anyone wanna fight?

3196
03:24:15,890 --> 03:24:16,290
Oh!

3197
03:24:16,490 --> 03:24:17,150
That guy's out!

3198
03:24:21,940 --> 03:24:22,800
I was...

3199
03:24:22,800 --> 03:24:24,320
I was too late.

3200
03:24:28,640 --> 03:24:29,400
Uh...

3201
03:24:29,400 --> 03:24:30,380
It wasn't me.

3202
03:24:31,300 --> 03:24:32,660
It wasn't me.

3203
03:24:34,420 --> 03:24:35,260
Wasn't me.

3204
03:24:35,620 --> 03:24:36,460
Who's talking?

3205
03:24:36,980 --> 03:24:37,320
In here?

3206
03:24:39,220 --> 03:24:39,940
How I...

3207
03:24:39,940 --> 03:24:41,060
No, no, no.

3208
03:24:42,580 --> 03:24:42,960
How?

3209
03:24:49,810 --> 03:24:51,370
We can go through here.

3210
03:24:53,950 --> 03:24:55,350
Ancient relic.

3211
03:24:56,490 --> 03:24:57,970
Clearly not Egyptian.

3212
03:24:59,310 --> 03:25:00,110
Clearly.

3213
03:25:00,570 --> 03:25:02,950
Oh, I think this opens that.

3214
03:25:05,010 --> 03:25:06,130
Oh my god.

3215
03:25:10,960 --> 03:25:12,860
I'll wait for him to turn around.

3216
03:25:20,720 --> 03:25:21,520
Go

3217
03:25:27,880 --> 03:25:29,160
away now, sir.

3218
03:25:33,570 --> 03:25:34,610
Go away now, sir.

3219
03:25:34,610 --> 03:25:34,730
Go away now, sir.

3220
03:25:43,080 --> 03:25:43,480
Nice.

3221
03:25:45,680 --> 03:25:46,040
I think.

3222
03:25:46,540 --> 03:25:46,900
Wait, what?

3223
03:25:47,020 --> 03:25:48,240
Is he still trying to walk in here?

3224
03:25:53,440 --> 03:25:54,660
There's nothing... no one here.

3225
03:25:57,320 --> 03:25:59,340
I'm just... I'm just pulling your chin.

3226
03:26:03,120 --> 03:26:05,700
Oh, I think he's walking away.

3227
03:26:20,780 --> 03:26:21,300
Um...

3228
03:26:24,690 --> 03:26:26,190
Anyone else wanna mess with me?

3229
03:26:35,080 --> 03:26:35,840
Oh, shit.

3230
03:26:36,560 --> 03:26:38,340
I should've waited a couple more seconds.

3231
03:26:39,460 --> 03:26:40,260
No ammo.

3232
03:26:41,720 --> 03:26:43,500
Maybe I shouldn't have said that out loud.

3233
03:26:43,500 --> 03:26:44,060
Okay.

3234
03:26:46,300 --> 03:26:47,220
I'll get him.

3235
03:26:47,920 --> 03:26:48,520
Where is he?

3236
03:26:49,800 --> 03:26:50,460
Where are you?

3237
03:26:51,080 --> 03:26:52,000
Where did you go?

3238
03:26:52,760 --> 03:26:53,240
No ammo.

3239
03:26:54,260 --> 03:26:54,660
Don't go.

3240
03:26:57,520 --> 03:26:59,020
He's making fun of me!

3241
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:02,940
What do you mean alarm whistle?

3242
03:27:05,820 --> 03:27:07,020
Come on.

3243
03:27:07,340 --> 03:27:08,200
Come on out.

3244
03:27:09,760 --> 03:27:11,200
I don't know how short you are!

3245
03:27:14,280 --> 03:27:15,140
This is out.

3246
03:27:20,250 --> 03:27:21,310
I think we got it.

3247
03:27:22,070 --> 03:27:23,130
I think we killed him.

3248
03:27:26,510 --> 03:27:28,370
I think we did it, guys.

3249
03:27:33,110 --> 03:27:34,410
It's nice and quiet.

3250
03:27:34,610 --> 03:27:35,350
I hear the crickets.

3251
03:27:37,970 --> 03:27:39,750
How did this guy get got though?

3252
03:27:42,830 --> 03:27:45,470
He's looking pretty... bad.

3253
03:27:48,730 --> 03:27:49,490
Mysterious.

3254
03:27:49,810 --> 03:27:51,010
So mysterious.

3255
03:27:52,590 --> 03:27:52,870
Thank you.

3256
03:27:55,330 --> 03:27:56,510
I guess we can leave.

3257
03:27:57,330 --> 03:27:59,630
What are the pictures I'm supposed to be taking?

3258
03:28:03,050 --> 03:28:04,350
Oh, my game saving.

3259
03:28:11,850 --> 03:28:14,150
Is that a real person?

3260
03:28:16,910 --> 03:28:17,670
Hello!

3261
03:28:20,370 --> 03:28:20,750
Hi!

3262
03:28:20,750 --> 03:28:22,790
Are you trying to get my attention?

3263
03:28:23,350 --> 03:28:23,690
What's up?

3264
03:28:25,370 --> 03:28:26,630
He was waving at me.

3265
03:28:28,790 --> 03:28:29,730
Shoot the guy dead.

3266
03:28:29,770 --> 03:28:30,730
I think I killed him.

3267
03:28:31,070 --> 03:28:31,590
What do you want?

3268
03:28:31,670 --> 03:28:32,670
What do you want from me?

3269
03:28:34,850 --> 03:28:35,590
What do you want?

3270
03:28:37,030 --> 03:28:38,370
Oh, you're a spy.

3271
03:28:38,970 --> 03:28:39,530
Hi, spy.

3272
03:28:39,530 --> 03:28:39,590
Hi.

3273
03:28:50,410 --> 03:28:51,530
Thank you!

3274
03:28:52,610 --> 03:28:54,230
He was like, hey, over here.

3275
03:28:59,880 --> 03:29:03,640
Okay, well, I didn't do anything in the Sphinx though.

3276
03:29:06,980 --> 03:29:09,020
We still haven't...

3277
03:29:10,220 --> 03:29:11,320
Yeah, thanks guy.

3278
03:29:11,320 --> 03:29:14,200
We haven't discovered anything in here.

3279
03:29:16,280 --> 03:29:18,360
I'm just gonna slide down gently.

3280
03:29:21,680 --> 03:29:22,560
Yeah, baby.

3281
03:29:28,800 --> 03:29:31,100
If any KFB are still here, how was the watch along?

3282
03:29:33,760 --> 03:29:35,300
Was Kiara so cute again today?

3283
03:29:38,440 --> 03:29:39,200
Hold on.

3284
03:29:42,280 --> 03:29:43,920
Maybe I do have to go inside.

3285
03:29:47,030 --> 03:29:49,420
My man's hat is glitching out.

3286
03:29:51,850 --> 03:29:53,260
Oh, there we go.

3287
03:30:06,000 --> 03:30:10,500
Do you think I can go in?

3288
03:30:12,500 --> 03:30:13,900
Picture, picture, picture.

3289
03:30:40,220 --> 03:30:42,590
The dream still...

3290
03:30:44,350 --> 03:30:44,870
Steely.

3291
03:30:49,130 --> 03:30:50,350
Anything here to Steely?

3292
03:30:51,430 --> 03:30:52,650
Besides the dream Steely?

3293
03:30:53,470 --> 03:30:54,770
Do you think I can get this guy?

3294
03:30:56,230 --> 03:30:57,510
I feel like I can get him.

3295
03:31:11,210 --> 03:31:12,570
Oh, someone heard me?

3296
03:31:13,630 --> 03:31:14,210
Who heard me?

3297
03:31:14,870 --> 03:31:15,130
Who?

3298
03:31:18,890 --> 03:31:19,410
Where?

3299
03:31:21,850 --> 03:31:23,470
Oh God, there he is!

3300
03:31:30,710 --> 03:31:32,280
Minky FPS VTuber!

3301
03:31:37,230 --> 03:31:38,090
Easy.

3302
03:31:38,630 --> 03:31:39,950
I'm gonna take your date.

3303
03:31:41,150 --> 03:31:41,890
Nice date.

3304
03:31:48,090 --> 03:31:48,950
Yeah,

3305
03:31:55,190 --> 03:31:58,810
make sure to vote for me FPS VTuber next year!

3306
03:32:09,180 --> 03:32:10,680
Yeah, sorry if the guns are loud.

3307
03:32:10,900 --> 03:32:12,120
They are loud for me too, but...

3308
03:32:12,620 --> 03:32:14,400
It's hard for me to like...

3309
03:32:14,400 --> 03:32:16,160
Keep switching between audio.

3310
03:32:24,900 --> 03:32:25,340
Bandages?

3311
03:32:25,960 --> 03:32:26,800
I'll take it.

3312
03:32:27,720 --> 03:32:28,480
Rob them line.

3313
03:32:37,250 --> 03:32:38,010
Oh my God!

3314
03:32:43,490 --> 03:32:44,530
Gina!

3315
03:32:46,230 --> 03:32:49,090
I was about to blow your head off!

3316
03:32:49,610 --> 03:32:50,430
No way!

3317
03:32:52,670 --> 03:32:53,710
Gina!

3318
03:32:54,950 --> 03:32:55,990
Girl!

3319
03:32:56,930 --> 03:32:58,330
Oh we got a disguise!

3320
03:32:59,510 --> 03:33:00,170
Let's go.

3321
03:33:04,330 --> 03:33:05,170
What is it?

3322
03:33:05,890 --> 03:33:06,530
Oh.

3323
03:33:13,150 --> 03:33:14,770
Hold on Joy.

3324
03:33:20,140 --> 03:33:22,420
Discovered a curious indentation on a wall.

3325
03:33:23,140 --> 03:33:24,640
Not sure what to make of it.

3326
03:33:25,120 --> 03:33:25,760
Mayor?

3327
03:33:26,740 --> 03:33:29,520
To take over as excavation leader from tomorrow.

3328
03:33:29,700 --> 03:33:30,800
He will investigate further.

3329
03:33:33,800 --> 03:33:37,880
Adelbert came by rambling about generators and some power failure.

3330
03:33:38,340 --> 03:33:40,100
I told him I had no time for his nonsense.

3331
03:33:41,180 --> 03:33:43,220
That man is nearly as insufferable as his brother.

3332
03:33:45,800 --> 03:33:47,260
Received telegram from the Vatican.

3333
03:33:47,420 --> 03:33:48,240
They found the artifacts.

3334
03:33:48,400 --> 03:33:49,480
Awaiting Vos' return.

3335
03:33:50,200 --> 03:33:51,360
Oh, Brandt and the Mayor.

3336
03:33:52,680 --> 03:33:53,460
Day 17.

3337
03:33:53,580 --> 03:33:54,740
I found a golden medallion.

3338
03:33:54,840 --> 03:33:57,140
Perhaps it could tell us how to enter the Sanctuary of the Guardians.

3339
03:33:58,900 --> 03:34:02,080
I'll store it in the recreational area until Vos gets back.

3340
03:34:02,200 --> 03:34:02,480
Mayor.

3341
03:34:04,460 --> 03:34:05,040
Mayor.

3342
03:34:22,400 --> 03:34:23,840
Don't have to tell me twice.

3343
03:34:23,960 --> 03:34:24,840
Let's get our disguise.

3344
03:34:27,360 --> 03:34:28,000
Yay!

3345
03:34:28,520 --> 03:34:29,120
Big outfit!

3346
03:34:31,820 --> 03:34:33,700
Now nobody will bother us.

3347
03:34:33,800 --> 03:34:34,120
Probably.

3348
03:34:34,440 --> 03:34:34,760
Hopefully.

3349
03:34:35,020 --> 03:34:35,280
Maybe.

3350
03:34:36,040 --> 03:34:37,700
They just can't look at us.

3351
03:34:40,400 --> 03:34:41,360
Very well.

3352
03:34:41,520 --> 03:34:42,440
Or they'll notice.

3353
03:34:44,340 --> 03:34:46,040
Yeah, I'm eating Taco Bowl.

3354
03:34:47,600 --> 03:34:48,880
Taco Bowl.

3355
03:34:51,960 --> 03:34:54,540
Not to be confused with it's funny counterpart.

3356
03:34:54,960 --> 03:34:55,600
Taco Bell.

3357
03:34:58,480 --> 03:34:59,620
Can I get over here?

3358
03:34:59,960 --> 03:35:01,060
I want to explore the top.

3359
03:35:02,640 --> 03:35:04,040
I bet there's valuables.

3360
03:35:08,220 --> 03:35:09,300
Oh, nice, Indy.

3361
03:35:09,420 --> 03:35:10,040
Nice, nice.

3362
03:35:11,340 --> 03:35:12,800
Oh wait, can I explore the top?

3363
03:35:14,480 --> 03:35:15,380
What's all this?

3364
03:35:16,140 --> 03:35:16,720
A waste?

3365
03:35:20,370 --> 03:35:20,770
Yes.

3366
03:35:27,810 --> 03:35:28,690
Okie dokie.

3367
03:35:29,790 --> 03:35:33,470
So now we're headed to... that way!

3368
03:35:39,500 --> 03:35:43,770
And we found some medicine bottles on the way, which is good good.

3369
03:35:48,950 --> 03:35:51,310
And... I think we can go up here.

3370
03:35:53,230 --> 03:35:55,790
And I look totally normal.

3371
03:35:56,250 --> 03:35:57,770
Like I am fitting in.

3372
03:36:00,350 --> 03:36:02,050
Ah, nobody will suspect a thing.

3373
03:36:03,990 --> 03:36:05,110
Over here?

3374
03:36:08,260 --> 03:36:09,540
This whole place?

3375
03:36:11,500 --> 03:36:12,180
This...

3376
03:36:13,480 --> 03:36:14,680
Looks kind of industrial.

3377
03:36:16,440 --> 03:36:17,660
I should have brought my gun.

3378
03:36:18,160 --> 03:36:18,960
Is that a dog?

3379
03:36:19,340 --> 03:36:20,000
Oh no.

3380
03:36:22,520 --> 03:36:23,140
Oh no.

3381
03:36:24,140 --> 03:36:25,320
Not the dog.

3382
03:36:31,720 --> 03:36:32,680
I'm going to pet that dog.

3383
03:36:34,180 --> 03:36:36,140
I'm just going to walk in with Moxie.

3384
03:36:36,620 --> 03:36:38,440
I'm going to walk in like I own the place.

3385
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:41,360
I belong here.

3386
03:36:53,660 --> 03:36:54,540
Right there.

3387
03:36:55,100 --> 03:36:56,440
Wait, is there another entrance?

3388
03:36:57,080 --> 03:36:58,480
I think I walked past it.

3389
03:36:58,480 --> 03:37:01,680
But I belong at this place.

3390
03:37:05,140 --> 03:37:06,720
Is he a captain?

3391
03:37:10,220 --> 03:37:11,840
Better stay away from here.

3392
03:37:16,720 --> 03:37:19,300
Thanks for making me laugh and smile Minky.

3393
03:37:19,500 --> 03:37:20,280
Thank you!

3394
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:24,280
Inside here?

3395
03:37:25,080 --> 03:37:25,480
Right?

3396
03:37:30,790 --> 03:37:32,750
Indiana Jones doesn't know how to use the door.

3397
03:37:33,970 --> 03:37:34,950
That is a door, right?

3398
03:37:35,450 --> 03:37:36,710
I'm just going to walk in with Moxie.

3399
03:37:37,350 --> 03:37:38,470
Nevermind, nevermind, nevermind.

3400
03:37:38,890 --> 03:37:39,190
Bless you.

3401
03:37:39,590 --> 03:37:40,450
Don't come over this way.

3402
03:37:41,010 --> 03:37:41,350
Sir!

3403
03:37:42,850 --> 03:37:44,470
This is my chance to go the other direction.

3404
03:37:45,370 --> 03:37:46,470
Now we can go the other way.

3405
03:37:50,810 --> 03:37:51,730
Hello, I'm here.

3406
03:37:52,070 --> 03:37:52,970
Hello, don't mind me.

3407
03:37:55,010 --> 03:37:55,350
Hello.

3408
03:37:59,150 --> 03:37:59,850
Me?

3409
03:38:08,850 --> 03:38:10,250
Ok,

3410
03:38:13,390 --> 03:38:13,850
sorry.

3411
03:38:16,410 --> 03:38:18,370
I'm giving it to you right now!

3412
03:38:32,540 --> 03:38:33,980
Say cheese, Ugo.

3413
03:38:34,320 --> 03:38:35,880
Oh, a card.

3414
03:38:37,700 --> 03:38:38,380
Jack card.

3415
03:38:40,460 --> 03:38:41,760
Why is it...what?

3416
03:38:43,940 --> 03:38:46,440
Jack of hearts with Gantz and Voss written on it.

3417
03:38:46,480 --> 03:38:47,620
Why is it a jack of hearts?

3418
03:38:51,110 --> 03:38:52,130
What does that mean?

3419
03:38:54,010 --> 03:38:54,990
Servant or knave?

3420
03:39:01,280 --> 03:39:04,180
Oh, they are looking at me.

3421
03:39:04,860 --> 03:39:05,720
Don't look at me.

3422
03:39:06,900 --> 03:39:07,760
Oh, it's money.

3423
03:39:08,360 --> 03:39:09,360
Oh, they are looking at me though.

3424
03:39:09,540 --> 03:39:10,120
My hand!

3425
03:39:10,200 --> 03:39:11,200
I'm stretching my hand.

3426
03:39:12,000 --> 03:39:13,220
I'm just stretching it out.

3427
03:39:13,780 --> 03:39:14,720
Don't worry about it.

3428
03:39:22,890 --> 03:39:24,970
Wait, who?

3429
03:39:26,250 --> 03:39:26,730
Where?

3430
03:39:26,850 --> 03:39:27,150
Who?

3431
03:39:27,150 --> 03:39:27,350
Who?

3432
03:39:28,230 --> 03:39:29,730
Ok, let's go back to the Sphinx.

3433
03:39:30,350 --> 03:39:31,450
We did what we needed to do.

3434
03:39:33,010 --> 03:39:34,210
We are so good at our job.

3435
03:39:40,310 --> 03:39:41,530
Lover Nacho subplot.

3436
03:39:41,610 --> 03:39:42,470
That's what I'm saying.

3437
03:39:45,490 --> 03:39:47,130
Can I punch this guy?

3438
03:39:47,370 --> 03:39:48,770
Do you think there is more than one guy in here?

3439
03:39:49,790 --> 03:39:50,710
I kind of want to...

3440
03:39:50,710 --> 03:39:52,330
Wait, it just saved.

3441
03:39:52,790 --> 03:39:54,750
I feel I could try and punch...

3442
03:39:54,750 --> 03:39:55,910
What did it say the site was?

3443
03:39:58,650 --> 03:39:59,850
Oh, hi.

3444
03:40:01,190 --> 03:40:02,390
Thank you.

3445
03:40:06,330 --> 03:40:07,950
Are you bored?

3446
03:40:08,310 --> 03:40:09,510
Are you so sad and bored?

3447
03:40:15,950 --> 03:40:17,850
Yeah, I should get out of here.

3448
03:40:20,710 --> 03:40:22,990
I'm sneaky everywhere you guys.

3449
03:40:26,050 --> 03:40:27,250
I'm so sneaky.

3450
03:40:28,190 --> 03:40:29,770
Alright, to the Sphinx.

3451
03:40:29,810 --> 03:40:30,270
To the Sphinx.

3452
03:40:30,590 --> 03:40:31,790
That's the only...

3453
03:40:31,790 --> 03:40:32,930
Hold on, I just want to make sure.

3454
03:40:33,710 --> 03:40:36,630
Yeah, our only field work currently is the sanctuary stuff.

3455
03:40:40,890 --> 03:40:44,270
What a way to store an ancient golden medallion.

3456
03:40:45,390 --> 03:40:45,870
Right?

3457
03:40:49,110 --> 03:40:49,590
Ok.

3458
03:40:51,470 --> 03:40:52,970
What are these noises in here?

3459
03:41:02,070 --> 03:41:02,510
Parkour.

3460
03:41:04,410 --> 03:41:04,850
Parkour.

3461
03:41:04,850 --> 03:41:05,410
Gina, are you still here?

3462
03:41:05,590 --> 03:41:06,150
Wow, you are.

3463
03:41:07,230 --> 03:41:08,830
Hey, I got the door.

3464
03:41:09,730 --> 03:41:10,290
Yep, shut up.

3465
03:41:13,270 --> 03:41:15,510
Ok, you can leave then.

3466
03:41:17,470 --> 03:41:17,910
Parkour!

3467
03:41:22,400 --> 03:41:22,840
Sesame.

3468
03:41:32,260 --> 03:41:32,720
Woah.

3469
03:41:33,380 --> 03:41:34,560
Are you sure about that?

3470
03:41:38,660 --> 03:41:40,520
What about the giant hole in the roof?

3471
03:41:46,100 --> 03:41:47,180
Oh, oh yeah.

3472
03:41:47,280 --> 03:41:47,800
Watch your step.

3473
03:41:49,680 --> 03:41:50,200
You can't?

3474
03:41:50,820 --> 03:41:51,340
I can.

3475
03:41:52,040 --> 03:41:53,480
Gina, you need glasses girl.

3476
03:41:57,600 --> 03:41:59,120
Yeah, we didn't even need the thing.

3477
03:41:59,120 --> 03:42:01,580
We could've...

3478
03:42:02,700 --> 03:42:03,860
Yeah, I don't like it.

3479
03:42:07,260 --> 03:42:07,780
Village market.

3480
03:42:10,020 --> 03:42:11,320
You are so brave.

3481
03:42:11,600 --> 03:42:12,600
Find a light source.

3482
03:42:12,800 --> 03:42:12,840
Ok.

3483
03:42:19,480 --> 03:42:21,180
I can't see the bottom.

3484
03:42:22,100 --> 03:42:22,360
Maybe.

3485
03:42:24,460 --> 03:42:25,240
Use your eyes.

3486
03:42:25,340 --> 03:42:26,840
Oh, I didn't notice this here.

3487
03:42:26,840 --> 03:42:29,040
Oh, sneaky.

3488
03:42:30,220 --> 03:42:31,140
Wheel of fortune.

3489
03:42:32,900 --> 03:42:33,820
Sneaky, sneaky.

3490
03:42:37,710 --> 03:42:38,270
Alright.

3491
03:42:42,260 --> 03:42:44,380
Oh, I feel like we could just...

3492
03:42:44,380 --> 03:42:45,460
Well, I guess the...

3493
03:42:45,460 --> 03:42:47,960
Big lights are attached to...

3494
03:42:48,720 --> 03:42:49,580
What's the word?

3495
03:42:52,200 --> 03:42:52,620
What?

3496
03:42:52,700 --> 03:42:53,760
They replaced him.

3497
03:42:55,300 --> 03:42:56,020
I was gonna say.

3498
03:42:56,100 --> 03:42:57,240
They are attached to a power source.

3499
03:42:57,240 --> 03:42:59,240
So probably would be difficult to...

3500
03:43:02,740 --> 03:43:04,620
To take one of those around.

3501
03:43:12,520 --> 03:43:13,260
Hello.

3502
03:43:16,260 --> 03:43:18,160
This is my work area.

3503
03:43:19,040 --> 03:43:19,620
Don't mind me.

3504
03:43:20,780 --> 03:43:22,120
Do not mind me.

3505
03:43:23,580 --> 03:43:24,220
Second.

3506
03:43:27,630 --> 03:43:28,050
Ok.

3507
03:43:30,770 --> 03:43:31,330
Hello.

3508
03:43:32,710 --> 03:43:34,210
Is that the right direction?

3509
03:43:36,430 --> 03:43:37,290
This way.

3510
03:43:38,950 --> 03:43:40,890
I thought by the village...

3511
03:43:40,890 --> 03:43:42,970
Marketplace, it meant this place.

3512
03:43:43,490 --> 03:43:45,450
You are so right.

3513
03:43:48,290 --> 03:43:49,850
I could sneak in.

3514
03:43:50,570 --> 03:43:52,150
I won't, but I could.

3515
03:43:53,430 --> 03:43:54,690
If I felt like it.

3516
03:43:54,850 --> 03:43:56,610
Shoot, I have to go all the way back around.

3517
03:44:00,890 --> 03:44:02,290
I should have checked.

3518
03:44:02,890 --> 03:44:03,790
I'm an idiot.

3519
03:44:06,360 --> 03:44:06,670
Ok.

3520
03:44:08,150 --> 03:44:09,090
Run, Indy.

3521
03:44:09,730 --> 03:44:11,410
Get those steps in, buddy.

3522
03:44:13,010 --> 03:44:14,750
No huffing and puffing here.

3523
03:44:14,950 --> 03:44:15,330
Oh no.

3524
03:44:15,990 --> 03:44:16,530
Where am I going?

3525
03:44:18,410 --> 03:44:19,230
All the way...

3526
03:44:19,230 --> 03:44:22,430
All the way down there.

3527
03:44:23,130 --> 03:44:24,030
Excuse me.

3528
03:44:25,310 --> 03:44:27,070
I'm just a little guy.

3529
03:44:27,130 --> 03:44:28,350
Trying to do his job.

3530
03:44:30,950 --> 03:44:32,450
Don't mind me.

3531
03:44:32,690 --> 03:44:36,650
Ok, so we do have now...

3532
03:44:37,610 --> 03:44:38,710
I thought that said Chungus.

3533
03:44:39,830 --> 03:44:41,010
Workers area.

3534
03:44:41,530 --> 03:44:42,570
And we'll get the village.

3535
03:44:43,230 --> 03:44:44,210
One soon.

3536
03:44:45,650 --> 03:44:46,910
You think that guy is still here?

3537
03:44:47,330 --> 03:44:48,470
The one that I shot.

3538
03:44:48,870 --> 03:44:49,410
Really well.

3539
03:44:55,230 --> 03:45:01,250
What riddles do you hold?

3540
03:45:02,850 --> 03:45:03,910
Don't mind me.

3541
03:45:05,070 --> 03:45:06,270
Oh, ok, rude.

3542
03:45:09,650 --> 03:45:10,410
Chungusville.

3543
03:45:10,610 --> 03:45:11,290
Chungus village.

3544
03:45:18,700 --> 03:45:20,220
I guess...

3545
03:45:20,220 --> 03:45:21,140
They ate him.

3546
03:45:23,960 --> 03:45:24,720
Probably.

3547
03:45:25,960 --> 03:45:26,300
Alright.

3548
03:45:26,700 --> 03:45:27,480
To the village.

3549
03:45:29,040 --> 03:45:30,180
Here's our village.

3550
03:45:34,120 --> 03:45:35,560
Run, Indy, run.

3551
03:45:43,080 --> 03:45:44,900
Oh, that was a big old dog.

3552
03:45:47,180 --> 03:45:48,240
What do you mean?

3553
03:46:13,600 --> 03:46:14,600
A blindfold?

3554
03:46:30,060 --> 03:46:32,640
I don't mean to barge in, ladies.

3555
03:46:33,720 --> 03:46:34,300
But...

3556
03:46:34,300 --> 03:46:36,300
I like the birds on your top.

3557
03:46:36,520 --> 03:46:37,980
Ok, she's like, don't...

3558
03:46:37,980 --> 03:46:38,900
Don't try.

3559
03:46:39,560 --> 03:46:42,900
She's like, don't...

3560
03:46:43,880 --> 03:46:45,700
I don't even want to hear it.

3561
03:46:47,600 --> 03:46:48,520
Yes, ma'am.

3562
03:46:48,600 --> 03:46:49,180
Sorry, ma'am.

3563
03:46:52,200 --> 03:46:52,860
Yay!

3564
03:46:53,040 --> 03:46:54,220
We made it.

3565
03:46:54,580 --> 03:46:57,150
Alright, time to find a light source.

3566
03:46:57,860 --> 03:46:58,880
It's right there.

3567
03:47:00,180 --> 03:47:00,740
Hello.

3568
03:47:02,720 --> 03:47:03,320
Hello.

3569
03:47:10,200 --> 03:47:12,140
A minkie?

3570
03:47:14,280 --> 03:47:15,820
A minkie?

3571
03:47:16,580 --> 03:47:17,280
Pocky!

3572
03:47:20,560 --> 03:47:23,000
So sassy.

3573
03:47:23,840 --> 03:47:26,000
My money pouch.

3574
03:47:27,820 --> 03:47:29,420
What is that?

3575
03:47:30,320 --> 03:47:35,020
For us?

3576
03:47:35,020 --> 03:47:36,860
For us?

3577
03:47:36,880 --> 03:47:37,480
Oh boy.

3578
03:47:37,880 --> 03:47:39,700
Ok, good thing we've been stealing a lot, right?

3579
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:42,680
Good thing we've been stealing a lot.

3580
03:47:43,120 --> 03:47:44,640
Sell me the minkie, actually.

3581
03:47:45,100 --> 03:47:45,740
How much is it?

3582
03:47:47,860 --> 03:47:48,340
75!

3583
03:47:50,700 --> 03:47:51,980
Where did all my money go?

3584
03:47:55,480 --> 03:47:58,840
I swear I had more money than 145 euros.

3585
03:47:59,640 --> 03:47:59,940
What?

3586
03:48:00,600 --> 03:48:04,640
How much for your books?

3587
03:48:07,940 --> 03:48:09,780
For books!

3588
03:48:13,640 --> 03:48:15,780
Holy moly.

3589
03:48:20,860 --> 03:48:22,360
I have to steal more.

3590
03:48:27,660 --> 03:48:29,060
Nice.

3591
03:48:29,060 --> 03:48:29,540
Thanks.

3592
03:48:32,040 --> 03:48:32,720
Hello.

3593
03:48:34,980 --> 03:48:36,240
Steep in thought.

3594
03:48:37,860 --> 03:48:39,720
I wish I could sell stuff.

3595
03:48:40,660 --> 03:48:41,360
Oh, sick.

3596
03:48:41,460 --> 03:48:42,180
An action figure.

3597
03:48:45,400 --> 03:48:46,440
Excuse me.

3598
03:48:46,980 --> 03:48:49,120
Who's got stuff that I can steal?

3599
03:48:50,760 --> 03:48:51,820
Do you steal?

3600
03:48:52,380 --> 03:48:53,700
Or rather...

3601
03:48:53,700 --> 03:48:56,080
There we go.

3602
03:48:56,080 --> 03:48:56,340
Ok.

3603
03:48:57,740 --> 03:48:58,340
Storyteller.

3604
03:49:03,060 --> 03:49:06,980
At least I'm rich in adventure points.

3605
03:49:08,460 --> 03:49:09,500
At least I...

3606
03:49:09,500 --> 03:49:10,460
Oh, what's Cut Man?

3607
03:49:10,880 --> 03:49:12,200
Oh, I forgot to read this one.

3608
03:49:13,300 --> 03:49:15,840
Oh, improved health bar regeneration efficiency.

3609
03:49:16,260 --> 03:49:17,740
Oh, hell yeah!

3610
03:49:19,880 --> 03:49:20,480
Nice.

3611
03:49:22,780 --> 03:49:24,840
I forgot how to do this, honestly.

3612
03:49:27,920 --> 03:49:28,840
Everything else?

3613
03:49:29,060 --> 03:49:30,740
Besides like Splinter...

3614
03:49:32,660 --> 03:49:33,180
Smash...

3615
03:49:33,180 --> 03:49:33,420
No.

3616
03:49:39,030 --> 03:49:39,930
Oh, what's this?

3617
03:49:41,430 --> 03:49:42,210
Take your books.

3618
03:49:43,310 --> 03:49:45,770
Improves the amount of health that is restored when applying bandages.

3619
03:49:47,450 --> 03:49:49,470
You're speaking my language, baby.

3620
03:49:50,730 --> 03:49:51,030
Wait.

3621
03:49:51,650 --> 03:49:52,530
Where is it?

3622
03:49:54,790 --> 03:49:55,690
Wait, where'd it go?

3623
03:49:55,850 --> 03:49:56,370
Oh, patch up.

3624
03:49:56,370 --> 03:49:57,430
Let's go?

3625
03:50:05,010 --> 03:50:07,290
Here, you guys listen to this story...

3626
03:50:08,970 --> 03:50:09,930
While I...

3627
03:50:09,930 --> 03:50:11,350
Eat a little bit more.

3628
03:50:38,590 --> 03:50:39,110
Oh...

3629
03:50:55,890 --> 03:50:57,470
What happened to the dog?

3630
03:50:58,710 --> 03:51:00,050
Oh, there's our dog!

3631
03:51:09,170 --> 03:51:09,850
Wait...

3632
03:51:09,850 --> 03:51:10,630
Wait, the dog spoke?

3633
03:51:12,570 --> 03:51:13,530
Wait, what?

3634
03:51:33,430 --> 03:51:35,510
I love the dog, it's just like, hey man.

3635
03:51:38,610 --> 03:51:41,550
Oh, I like these reactions.

3636
03:51:48,130 --> 03:51:49,670
Let's go for the dog?

3637
03:51:57,310 --> 03:51:58,570
Oh, easy.

3638
03:52:07,870 --> 03:52:08,390
Ah...

3639
03:52:08,390 --> 03:52:08,910
Thank you!

3640
03:52:14,870 --> 03:52:16,130
Thanks for the story!

3641
03:52:17,130 --> 03:52:18,610
I like the part when the dog talked.

3642
03:52:23,270 --> 03:52:23,790
Sassy.

3643
03:52:27,050 --> 03:52:28,470
Oh, this looks messy.

3644
03:52:28,570 --> 03:52:29,090
Wait a second.

3645
03:52:29,090 --> 03:52:30,410
I...

3646
03:52:30,750 --> 03:52:32,350
I recognize this door.

3647
03:52:34,710 --> 03:52:37,410
I recognize this type of door.

3648
03:52:41,470 --> 03:52:43,150
Let me in!

3649
03:52:43,370 --> 03:52:44,650
I wanna brawl!

3650
03:52:44,730 --> 03:52:47,100
I'm ready to...

3651
03:52:47,100 --> 03:52:49,900
The knuckle duster dead?

3652
03:52:50,400 --> 03:52:52,440
I'm ready to fight!

3653
03:52:56,460 --> 03:52:57,860
Let me in!

3654
03:52:58,700 --> 03:53:00,380
Wait, do I need to eat more fruit?

3655
03:53:10,640 --> 03:53:11,280
And grab.

3656
03:53:12,140 --> 03:53:12,780
Yoink!

3657
03:53:13,620 --> 03:53:15,160
Oh, good boy!

3658
03:53:16,780 --> 03:53:19,060
You can't pet the dogs in these games.

3659
03:53:26,860 --> 03:53:28,900
Did you see that monkey?

3660
03:53:31,180 --> 03:53:32,360
He sees nothing.

3661
03:53:37,760 --> 03:53:38,840
What do I...

3662
03:53:40,900 --> 03:53:42,760
What do I do with this?

3663
03:53:47,540 --> 03:53:47,960
What do I do with this?

3664
03:53:54,840 --> 03:53:55,780
Grandmother's chalice.

3665
03:53:55,860 --> 03:53:58,480
It was most likely stolen by Asma's monkey.

3666
03:54:01,380 --> 03:54:01,900
Okay.

3667
03:54:02,540 --> 03:54:04,260
Do I put it away?

3668
03:54:04,380 --> 03:54:06,180
What do I do with...

3669
03:54:06,180 --> 03:54:06,860
Who's grandma?

3670
03:54:12,320 --> 03:54:13,940
I'm such a creep.

3671
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:18,280
What do I...

3672
03:54:18,280 --> 03:54:19,040
Who's grandma?

3673
03:54:20,200 --> 03:54:21,060
Give it back...

3674
03:54:21,060 --> 03:54:21,540
Where?

3675
03:54:23,220 --> 03:54:25,160
Who do I give it back to?

3676
03:54:26,560 --> 03:54:27,080
Grandma!

3677
03:54:28,720 --> 03:54:29,580
Grandma!

3678
03:54:30,240 --> 03:54:31,160
I think your monkey...

3679
03:54:36,130 --> 03:54:36,560
Grandma!

3680
03:54:37,320 --> 03:54:38,080
Grandma!

3681
03:54:39,680 --> 03:54:41,640
Grandma, I have your cup!

3682
03:54:43,760 --> 03:54:44,520
Don't...

3683
03:54:44,520 --> 03:54:45,740
Walk around town and listen.

3684
03:54:45,900 --> 03:54:47,920
I don't know.

3685
03:54:49,880 --> 03:54:50,640
Grandma...

3686
03:54:50,640 --> 03:54:51,240
Hi.

3687
03:54:52,240 --> 03:54:53,620
I'm looking for grandma.

3688
03:54:58,420 --> 03:54:59,180
But...

3689
03:54:59,180 --> 03:55:01,420
What are you talking about?

3690
03:55:01,860 --> 03:55:02,880
Indiana Jones, please.

3691
03:55:08,960 --> 03:55:09,880
What's happening?

3692
03:55:10,920 --> 03:55:11,920
Hold on, sorry.

3693
03:55:12,040 --> 03:55:12,600
I'll read that later.

3694
03:55:16,260 --> 03:55:17,920
Who are you talking to?

3695
03:55:21,100 --> 03:55:24,720
The curse of the Vatican is truly making us...

3696
03:55:24,720 --> 03:55:25,920
It's getting to us, everybody.

3697
03:55:26,840 --> 03:55:28,560
I fear that Indiana Jones will...

3698
03:55:29,680 --> 03:55:30,540
Oh, grandma!

3699
03:55:37,000 --> 03:55:38,120
Ooh!

3700
03:55:39,200 --> 03:55:40,460
Hamamashi recipe.

3701
03:55:42,080 --> 03:55:43,720
Fry the birds?

3702
03:55:46,800 --> 03:55:50,540
I got your cup, grandma.

3703
03:55:52,560 --> 03:55:54,000
You don't look like a grandma.

3704
03:56:00,200 --> 03:56:02,520
She said grandma, right?

3705
03:56:02,520 --> 03:56:04,520
Can I throw it?

3706
03:56:09,660 --> 03:56:10,320
Can I throw it?

3707
03:56:14,820 --> 03:56:15,240
Grandma.

3708
03:56:15,880 --> 03:56:17,280
Oh my god.

3709
03:56:17,740 --> 03:56:18,400
Other grandma?

3710
03:56:19,360 --> 03:56:21,440
Any other grandmas missing a cup?

3711
03:56:23,940 --> 03:56:26,160
Look at those chickens!

3712
03:56:28,100 --> 03:56:30,260
They are so brave.

3713
03:56:30,340 --> 03:56:32,140
I thought you were a person.

3714
03:56:34,700 --> 03:56:35,180
Hello?

3715
03:56:35,180 --> 03:56:35,300
Hello?

3716
03:56:37,060 --> 03:56:37,940
Hi, grandma?

3717
03:56:41,340 --> 03:56:42,700
What am I taking a picture of?

3718
03:56:42,760 --> 03:56:43,620
Oh, the dog!

3719
03:56:50,320 --> 03:56:51,200
Good photo.

3720
03:56:51,500 --> 03:56:52,660
I want a good photo of you.

3721
03:56:54,160 --> 03:56:54,820
Come on.

3722
03:56:55,380 --> 03:56:56,040
Why isn't it...

3723
03:56:56,040 --> 03:56:56,580
Oh, here we go.

3724
03:56:58,280 --> 03:56:58,720
Nice.

3725
03:57:01,340 --> 03:57:02,480
He's like head bobbing.

3726
03:57:06,940 --> 03:57:07,480
Haha.

3727
03:57:08,580 --> 03:57:10,040
Where did I put the cup at?

3728
03:57:13,280 --> 03:57:14,400
By grandma's cup?

3729
03:57:14,480 --> 03:57:14,920
Where did you go?

3730
03:57:16,860 --> 03:57:17,620
Grandma's cup?

3731
03:57:20,460 --> 03:57:21,260
Grandma's cup?

3732
03:57:22,720 --> 03:57:23,340
Oh no.

3733
03:57:24,100 --> 03:57:24,780
No, no, no.

3734
03:57:25,420 --> 03:57:26,360
Where did it go?

3735
03:57:27,200 --> 03:57:28,100
By the dog?

3736
03:57:30,160 --> 03:57:31,220
No, it's not.

3737
03:57:33,520 --> 03:57:35,140
Where did grandma's cup go?

3738
03:57:36,960 --> 03:57:37,480
No!

3739
03:57:38,140 --> 03:57:39,320
Oh my god, no.

3740
03:57:39,520 --> 03:57:40,500
I think...

3741
03:57:40,500 --> 03:57:41,320
Was it stolen?

3742
03:57:41,740 --> 03:57:42,680
Did it roll away?

3743
03:57:42,860 --> 03:57:43,840
Is this grandma's cup?

3744
03:57:43,900 --> 03:57:44,500
What is this?

3745
03:57:46,060 --> 03:57:47,000
A basketball?

3746
03:57:50,560 --> 03:57:52,080
Someone stole the cup.

3747
03:57:55,360 --> 03:57:57,320
It goes back to where it was.

3748
03:57:57,320 --> 03:57:58,280
Nice.

3749
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:06,320
There's so many pictures to take of.

3750
03:58:06,920 --> 03:58:08,420
I guess it's...

3751
03:58:08,420 --> 03:58:11,320
I guess it's good though, because...

3752
03:58:12,360 --> 03:58:15,480
It makes it so that you can get lots of points.

3753
03:58:16,600 --> 03:58:18,120
Where was that monkey at?

3754
03:58:18,260 --> 03:58:19,460
Oh my god, here.

3755
03:58:20,800 --> 03:58:21,940
Oh, thank goodness.

3756
03:58:21,940 --> 03:58:22,000
Thank goodness.

3757
03:58:27,990 --> 03:58:29,510
I was worried.

3758
03:58:32,990 --> 03:58:35,410
Monkey stole my cup.

3759
03:58:35,810 --> 03:58:38,110
Which I stole from him.

3760
03:58:38,790 --> 03:58:39,790
Oh, yeah, that's me.

3761
03:58:39,970 --> 03:58:40,070
Hey.

3762
03:58:43,770 --> 03:58:44,010
Yeah?

3763
03:58:45,070 --> 03:58:46,030
Abandoned camp.

3764
03:58:48,030 --> 03:58:49,090
Wild dogs?

3765
03:58:59,600 --> 03:59:02,140
Be a good spy and tell me who this belongs to.

3766
03:59:13,140 --> 03:59:14,540
Does anybody know?

3767
03:59:16,780 --> 03:59:18,240
Does anybody know?

3768
03:59:19,720 --> 03:59:22,520
At least the dogs aren't so difficult to get rid of.

3769
03:59:23,220 --> 03:59:24,320
You just have to whip them.

3770
03:59:26,680 --> 03:59:27,700
Grandma, you.

3771
03:59:27,940 --> 03:59:28,780
You must be the grandma.

3772
03:59:30,280 --> 03:59:31,300
You lost your cup?

3773
03:59:31,840 --> 03:59:34,160
Look at that ugly old cup you're using.

3774
03:59:34,540 --> 03:59:35,500
This is your cup.

3775
03:59:35,500 --> 03:59:39,460
This is the cup that you...

3776
03:59:40,940 --> 03:59:42,080
Don't give me that look.

3777
03:59:42,560 --> 03:59:48,000
This is the cup you've been waiting all your life for.

3778
03:59:48,700 --> 03:59:49,960
Oh, she doesn't seem very impressed.

3779
03:59:50,240 --> 03:59:53,100
Okay, okay.

3780
03:59:54,860 --> 03:59:56,120
Gosh, you guys.

3781
03:59:56,460 --> 03:59:59,460
I don't want to run all around looking for grandma.

3782
04:00:03,640 --> 04:00:04,360
Grandma!

3783
04:00:06,600 --> 04:00:07,320
Grandma?

3784
04:00:11,280 --> 04:00:13,120
Oh my God, a goat.

3785
04:00:17,160 --> 04:00:17,880
Really?

3786
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:19,940
I'll take a look.

3787
04:00:20,720 --> 04:00:21,500
What do you got?

3788
04:00:21,740 --> 04:00:23,000
Look at his jacket.

3789
04:00:23,600 --> 04:00:24,980
He looks so good.

3790
04:00:37,170 --> 04:00:37,730
Ah!

3791
04:00:42,110 --> 04:00:44,710
I dropped it for two seconds.

3792
04:00:49,550 --> 04:00:50,670
I just...

3793
04:00:50,670 --> 04:00:52,610
I feel like at this point...

3794
04:00:53,250 --> 04:00:53,810
Where?

3795
04:00:54,550 --> 04:00:55,230
Who said that?

3796
04:00:56,450 --> 04:00:57,550
Hold on.

3797
04:00:57,730 --> 04:00:58,650
I know a monkey.

3798
04:00:59,030 --> 04:00:59,410
Hold on.

3799
04:00:59,790 --> 04:01:01,310
I know where your cup is.

3800
04:01:02,390 --> 04:01:03,270
Where is it?

3801
04:01:04,170 --> 04:01:05,110
Hello, hello, hello.

3802
04:01:05,870 --> 04:01:07,330
I heard, I heard, I heard.

3803
04:01:07,790 --> 04:01:08,230
I heard.

3804
04:01:08,710 --> 04:01:09,250
Yes, yes.

3805
04:01:09,590 --> 04:01:10,230
I have it.

3806
04:01:10,610 --> 04:01:13,130
I have your damn grandma's chalice, please.

3807
04:01:15,210 --> 04:01:15,990
Who said that?

3808
04:01:17,630 --> 04:01:18,530
Who said the chalice?

3809
04:01:21,030 --> 04:01:23,090
Why would someone poison the dates?

3810
04:01:23,250 --> 04:01:24,150
That's such a good reference.

3811
04:01:25,430 --> 04:01:25,590
You?

3812
04:01:30,370 --> 04:01:31,210
Oh, there you go.

3813
04:01:35,330 --> 04:01:36,230
You're welcome.

3814
04:01:36,510 --> 04:01:37,070
Give me my money.

3815
04:01:52,020 --> 04:01:52,960
That's it?

3816
04:02:03,550 --> 04:02:04,830
Nothing happened?

3817
04:02:05,910 --> 04:02:07,570
She didn't give me anything?

3818
04:02:08,370 --> 04:02:09,670
I'm gonna do it.

3819
04:02:10,290 --> 04:02:11,150
I'm gonna jump.

3820
04:02:15,690 --> 04:02:17,510
I actually took damage for that.

3821
04:02:17,510 --> 04:02:19,970
Hi, I'm gonna take your cookies.

3822
04:02:24,650 --> 04:02:25,790
Anything else?

3823
04:02:25,910 --> 04:02:27,450
Alright, let's go back to the site.

3824
04:02:30,470 --> 04:02:32,370
That's so mean!

3825
04:02:33,310 --> 04:02:35,030
Not even achieving nothing.

3826
04:02:35,950 --> 04:02:37,770
Nothing at all.

3827
04:02:40,970 --> 04:02:41,730
Okay.

3828
04:02:42,690 --> 04:02:44,190
Which way was that?

3829
04:02:45,450 --> 04:02:46,330
Over yonder.

3830
04:02:47,090 --> 04:02:49,990
Probably could have just looked in any direction for a giant sphinx.

3831
04:02:54,690 --> 04:02:55,130
Okay.

3832
04:02:57,310 --> 04:02:57,750
Alright.

3833
04:02:59,990 --> 04:03:01,410
Wow, there's a watchtower.

3834
04:03:02,070 --> 04:03:03,290
I didn't notice that before.

3835
04:03:04,030 --> 04:03:05,170
You think this place is...

3836
04:03:05,170 --> 04:03:06,390
No, I killed all of them.

3837
04:03:06,970 --> 04:03:07,990
I don't think anybody's back.

3838
04:03:11,370 --> 04:03:13,090
I don't think anybody's back.

3839
04:03:13,850 --> 04:03:14,410
I think we're good.

3840
04:03:14,410 --> 04:03:14,490
Okay.

3841
04:03:15,890 --> 04:03:16,850
Other way.

3842
04:03:17,730 --> 04:03:24,390
Might be faster, but I see some cookies and I'll eat some fruit.

3843
04:03:25,110 --> 04:03:26,190
Oh, that is not fruit.

3844
04:03:29,350 --> 04:03:30,670
Take your prickly pears.

3845
04:03:31,590 --> 04:03:33,110
I wanna go tomb raiding with mint.

3846
04:03:34,810 --> 04:03:36,850
I think I wouldn't be a good tomb raider though.

3847
04:03:36,950 --> 04:03:37,710
I'm afraid of...

3848
04:03:38,310 --> 04:03:39,730
I'm afraid of the spiders.

3849
04:03:39,730 --> 04:03:39,930
Spiders.

3850
04:03:41,770 --> 04:03:43,550
Like all the spiderwebs and stuff.

3851
04:03:44,410 --> 04:03:46,150
I don't think I... I think I would chicken out.

3852
04:03:46,270 --> 04:03:48,390
I think I'd be baby about it.

3853
04:03:58,420 --> 04:03:59,440
Is there anything in here?

3854
04:04:00,140 --> 04:04:00,840
Nope, okay.

3855
04:04:05,500 --> 04:04:05,940
Parkour!

3856
04:04:06,320 --> 04:04:06,760
Parkour!

3857
04:04:07,320 --> 04:04:07,760
Parkour!

3858
04:04:08,100 --> 04:04:08,500
Parkour!

3859
04:04:09,520 --> 04:04:10,840
Oh my god, you scared me.

3860
04:04:10,940 --> 04:04:11,120
Hello.

3861
04:04:14,220 --> 04:04:16,180
Indy hates snakes and he still does it.

3862
04:04:16,180 --> 04:04:17,040
Yeah.

3863
04:04:18,780 --> 04:04:19,780
That's his job.

3864
04:04:21,440 --> 04:04:21,780
You know?

3865
04:04:22,060 --> 04:04:23,540
It's not my job to tomb raid.

3866
04:04:24,360 --> 04:04:24,960
Just saying.

3867
04:04:26,460 --> 04:04:28,280
This doesn't seem like a lot of light.

3868
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:32,900
What do you mean to extinguish the flame?

3869
04:04:34,260 --> 04:04:35,220
What do you mean by that?

3870
04:04:43,460 --> 04:04:44,280
I've got you.

3871
04:04:46,180 --> 04:04:46,300
What?

3872
04:04:48,860 --> 04:04:50,460
Holy moly!

3873
04:04:51,060 --> 04:04:52,000
Um...

3874
04:04:52,000 --> 04:04:53,480
Well that...

3875
04:04:54,580 --> 04:04:56,180
Don't worry.

3876
04:04:58,960 --> 04:04:59,300
Yeah.

3877
04:05:08,330 --> 04:05:09,270
Uh...

3878
04:05:09,270 --> 04:05:10,910
Oh, pass through up here.

3879
04:05:11,090 --> 04:05:11,910
I have to climb.

3880
04:05:14,910 --> 04:05:15,850
Okay.

3881
04:05:15,850 --> 04:05:15,990
Okay.

3882
04:05:21,810 --> 04:05:22,810
Climb down?

3883
04:05:25,490 --> 04:05:27,290
I like it spiky down there.

3884
04:05:27,790 --> 04:05:28,830
There's nothing down here.

3885
04:05:29,590 --> 04:05:30,650
I don't think...

3886
04:05:30,650 --> 04:05:31,950
They're here!

3887
04:05:32,550 --> 04:05:33,130
Oh my gosh.

3888
04:05:33,330 --> 04:05:34,710
I didn't see that at all.

3889
04:05:35,450 --> 04:05:37,370
Good thing my...

3890
04:05:37,370 --> 04:05:38,390
Yep.

3891
04:05:39,010 --> 04:05:40,350
Good thing my whip is magical.

3892
04:05:40,350 --> 04:05:41,290
Uh...

3893
04:05:48,000 --> 04:05:49,400
Yep.

3894
04:05:53,280 --> 04:05:53,940
Nice, nice.

3895
04:05:54,860 --> 04:05:55,500
Nice, nice.

3896
04:05:59,940 --> 04:06:00,980
What's over here?

3897
04:06:05,720 --> 04:06:08,780
I got you.

3898
04:06:11,800 --> 04:06:13,200
Strombo!

3899
04:06:15,040 --> 04:06:16,660
Hold on, I'm looking around too.

3900
04:06:19,900 --> 04:06:21,840
Hold on, I want to look around as well.

3901
04:06:22,300 --> 04:06:22,460
Oh.

3902
04:06:23,560 --> 04:06:24,240
What was that?

3903
04:06:24,520 --> 04:06:25,080
Who sneezed?

3904
04:06:26,800 --> 04:06:28,020
Who just sneezed?

3905
04:06:33,910 --> 04:06:34,730
Okay guys.

3906
04:06:36,210 --> 04:06:36,790
I'm gonna jump!

3907
04:06:40,230 --> 04:06:44,070
I don't know about that.

3908
04:06:45,270 --> 04:06:46,710
I don't know about that.

3909
04:06:48,230 --> 04:06:50,650
I would guess so, yeah.

3910
04:06:54,250 --> 04:06:55,730
You sneezed?

3911
04:06:55,730 --> 04:06:56,190
It was you?

3912
04:06:57,430 --> 04:06:58,850
Ancient relic.

3913
04:06:59,490 --> 04:07:00,110
The sussy.

3914
04:07:04,530 --> 04:07:06,390
Oh my god.

3915
04:07:06,650 --> 04:07:06,910
Hello.

3916
04:07:08,830 --> 04:07:09,770
Lots of writings.

3917
04:07:10,950 --> 04:07:11,990
Lots of stuff.

3918
04:07:13,030 --> 04:07:13,430
Okay.

3919
04:07:14,350 --> 04:07:15,750
Making our way through.

3920
04:07:19,510 --> 04:07:20,110
Fascinating.

3921
04:07:21,970 --> 04:07:24,710
This looks like an important fancy room.

3922
04:07:29,760 --> 04:07:31,060
It's a light puzzle!

3923
04:07:31,560 --> 04:07:31,900
I think.

3924
04:07:34,240 --> 04:07:35,100
I know.

3925
04:07:35,940 --> 04:07:43,400
I know I'm a week late, but thank you for the concert and making me and my friends cry from last cup of coffee.

3926
04:07:46,260 --> 04:07:46,820
Awesome.

3927
04:07:49,920 --> 04:07:50,700
What do you mean?

3928
04:07:52,340 --> 04:07:55,520
When are we getting official freak phantom glasses merch?

3929
04:07:56,120 --> 04:07:57,380
Never say never.

3930
04:07:57,760 --> 04:07:59,340
Well, you didn't say that, but...

3931
04:07:59,340 --> 04:08:01,780
I don't know when I can get around to it.

3932
04:08:02,040 --> 04:08:03,000
But it will happen.

3933
04:08:05,260 --> 04:08:06,740
I would like to make.

3934
04:08:08,200 --> 04:08:09,220
Thank you Panzer!

3935
04:08:09,300 --> 04:08:10,340
I'm glad you liked the concert!

3936
04:08:10,980 --> 04:08:11,660
Thank you.

3937
04:08:11,660 --> 04:08:14,600
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you.

3938
04:08:14,900 --> 04:08:18,680
Alright, let's figure out this.

3939
04:08:19,860 --> 04:08:21,000
This puzzle.

3940
04:08:21,600 --> 04:08:22,820
What is this?

3941
04:08:23,480 --> 04:08:24,340
Can I move this?

3942
04:08:25,340 --> 04:08:27,260
It looks...

3943
04:08:28,320 --> 04:08:29,880
Well, I can move this.

3944
04:08:41,700 --> 04:08:43,660
This guy seems...

3945
04:08:46,440 --> 04:08:48,960
I think your big head is in the way, Gina.

3946
04:08:50,280 --> 04:08:51,780
I think you need to get out.

3947
04:08:55,180 --> 04:08:57,140
I love Doki Bird's meow meow song.

3948
04:08:57,960 --> 04:08:59,200
I found it.

3949
04:08:59,840 --> 04:09:01,760
I was like curious about it.

3950
04:09:03,040 --> 04:09:08,120
And I found a Japanese version of the song.

3951
04:09:09,140 --> 04:09:11,840
So I was like, what if I try singing it.

3952
04:09:11,840 --> 04:09:12,620
It's so cute.

3953
04:09:19,440 --> 04:09:22,780
Oh my god, finally.

3954
04:09:23,880 --> 04:09:25,000
He's getting...

3955
04:09:25,000 --> 04:09:26,620
Finally, he's like...

3956
04:09:26,620 --> 04:09:28,180
He's being just as sassy.

3957
04:09:28,680 --> 04:09:30,200
Oh my god, finally.

3958
04:09:30,400 --> 04:09:32,600
Yes, have a backbone, Indiana Jones.

3959
04:09:34,760 --> 04:09:35,880
Ok, actually...

3960
04:09:35,880 --> 04:09:37,380
This one probably goes to this.

3961
04:09:39,120 --> 04:09:40,200
If I had to wager.

3962
04:09:41,860 --> 04:09:43,020
If I had to guess.

3963
04:09:43,300 --> 04:09:44,140
Alright, nice.

3964
04:09:46,260 --> 04:09:49,060
I'm gonna shine this right at...

3965
04:09:49,060 --> 04:09:50,740
Chat, right in your face.

3966
04:09:52,920 --> 04:09:54,640
You think like this it'll work?

3967
04:09:54,960 --> 04:09:56,180
Or does it have to be all four?

3968
04:09:56,380 --> 04:09:58,000
I don't think it's possible to be all four.

3969
04:10:14,170 --> 04:10:15,330
I am protected.

3970
04:10:16,070 --> 04:10:16,850
For now.

3971
04:10:29,440 --> 04:10:31,000
That didn't work.

3972
04:10:33,140 --> 04:10:35,440
I don't think these have to do with it either.

3973
04:10:39,460 --> 04:10:41,340
Is that not bright enough for you?

3974
04:10:44,600 --> 04:10:45,900
Is it not hitting it?

3975
04:10:48,360 --> 04:10:49,700
Maybe a hidden one.

3976
04:10:50,660 --> 04:10:51,060
Maybe.

3977
04:10:54,560 --> 04:10:56,340
There is something shining... Oh no.

3978
04:11:00,920 --> 04:11:01,560
That's...

3979
04:11:12,780 --> 04:11:15,700
It wouldn't be possible to do...

3980
04:11:18,720 --> 04:11:19,820
It is on it, right?

3981
04:11:25,570 --> 04:11:28,010
Yeah, it's on it, I think.

3982
04:11:35,480 --> 04:11:37,340
The bottom ones, these.

3983
04:11:40,640 --> 04:11:42,020
Do these even count?

3984
04:11:56,430 --> 04:11:59,150
It's not... It's not that...

3985
04:11:59,670 --> 04:12:01,150
That you need it to...

3986
04:12:01,870 --> 04:12:02,370
Oh, okay.

3987
04:12:02,810 --> 04:12:03,410
I understand.

3988
04:12:04,730 --> 04:12:07,730
No, please!

3989
04:12:08,530 --> 04:12:09,570
Okay, like this.

3990
04:12:11,590 --> 04:12:13,430
Apex679, thank you so much!

3991
04:12:16,630 --> 04:12:17,290
Okay...

3992
04:12:18,310 --> 04:12:18,970
And...

3993
04:12:18,970 --> 04:12:19,910
Nice!

3994
04:12:37,510 --> 04:12:40,350
I don't know if wonderful is the right word.

3995
04:12:40,770 --> 04:12:41,730
It's so scary!

3996
04:12:58,550 --> 04:12:59,030
What?

3997
04:12:59,110 --> 04:12:59,790
What if it's the mask?

3998
04:13:02,450 --> 04:13:04,970
What if it's like the mask in Lethal Company?

3999
04:13:14,060 --> 04:13:16,180
I don't know if this is going to end well.

4000
04:13:20,500 --> 04:13:21,200
Oh boy.

4001
04:13:23,440 --> 04:13:24,060
Madam.

4002
04:13:25,560 --> 04:13:26,180
Madam!

4003
04:13:38,120 --> 04:13:38,740
No,

4004
04:13:46,420 --> 04:13:46,840
the mask!

4005
04:14:00,530 --> 04:14:02,310
Sit on the haunted chair.

4006
04:14:03,150 --> 04:14:05,830
To be fair, I didn't think it was a throne.

4007
04:14:08,890 --> 04:14:10,170
He's so pissed off.

4008
04:14:12,230 --> 04:14:14,150
Isn't he so pissy all the time?

4009
04:14:19,690 --> 04:14:20,890
Good question.

4010
04:14:30,910 --> 04:14:31,830
Torch, torch.

4011
04:14:32,390 --> 04:14:32,870
There you go.

4012
04:14:32,870 --> 04:14:33,830
Yay!

4013
04:14:37,010 --> 04:14:39,010
Oh, that's not the right way.

4014
04:14:41,370 --> 04:14:41,970
Here.

4015
04:14:46,190 --> 04:14:47,770
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

4016
04:14:48,750 --> 04:14:49,930
Why are there so many?

4017
04:14:51,610 --> 04:14:53,850
I don't think scorpions are this big, right?

4018
04:14:57,190 --> 04:14:58,690
Hey, are we sure?

4019
04:15:00,130 --> 04:15:01,210
Where is the torch?

4020
04:15:01,210 --> 04:15:02,410
Oh, nice.

4021
04:15:02,870 --> 04:15:03,430
I'll take that.

4022
04:15:05,110 --> 04:15:06,610
And light it.

4023
04:15:07,610 --> 04:15:08,290
Nice.

4024
04:15:12,720 --> 04:15:14,450
Tig, go away!

4025
04:15:15,710 --> 04:15:17,130
Get out of here.

4026
04:15:18,050 --> 04:15:20,530
This wall looks weak.

4027
04:15:24,010 --> 04:15:26,130
Something heavy.

4028
04:15:32,370 --> 04:15:33,650
Something heavy.

4029
04:15:34,770 --> 04:15:35,410
This?

4030
04:15:36,590 --> 04:15:36,910
I

4031
04:15:40,770 --> 04:15:41,810
found another door instead!

4032
04:15:44,770 --> 04:15:46,310
I found something.

4033
04:15:46,530 --> 04:15:48,270
I found...what do you mean you doubt it?

4034
04:15:49,650 --> 04:15:51,290
There are more weapons in here though.

4035
04:15:55,740 --> 04:15:57,760
Congratulations on 300k, Mito!

4036
04:15:58,720 --> 04:15:59,600
Thank you!

4037
04:16:06,880 --> 04:16:07,680
Ouch, ouch.

4038
04:16:12,080 --> 04:16:12,520
Nice.

4039
04:16:13,240 --> 04:16:14,840
Alright, now let me go get my torch.

4040
04:16:15,860 --> 04:16:17,600
Like, do something, Gina.

4041
04:16:18,420 --> 04:16:18,860
Gina.

4042
04:16:19,720 --> 04:16:21,140
Gina, I need you to go in front of me.

4043
04:16:21,540 --> 04:16:21,760
Gina.

4044
04:16:22,520 --> 04:16:22,900
Gina.

4045
04:16:24,060 --> 04:16:24,500
Gina.

4046
04:16:27,180 --> 04:16:28,960
I need my torch, Gina.

4047
04:16:29,960 --> 04:16:30,400
Gina!

4048
04:16:38,340 --> 04:16:38,780
OK.

4049
04:16:40,220 --> 04:16:41,720
What do you want me to do in here?

4050
04:16:45,120 --> 04:16:46,200
Oh, my torch.

4051
04:16:46,540 --> 04:16:47,320
Or my lighter.

4052
04:16:48,720 --> 04:16:51,700
I guess I could have used my lighter to go get my torch back.

4053
04:16:53,860 --> 04:16:55,380
This game is so funny.

4054
04:17:00,090 --> 04:17:01,310
Oh my god.

4055
04:17:06,310 --> 04:17:08,170
Why are there so many scorpions?

4056
04:17:09,730 --> 04:17:11,450
Why are there so many scorpions?

4057
04:17:11,450 --> 04:17:14,430
Oh, we're back in here.

4058
04:17:14,490 --> 04:17:14,790
Nice.

4059
04:17:17,570 --> 04:17:18,230
Come on, Gina.

4060
04:17:18,990 --> 04:17:19,710
We're safe now.

4061
04:17:19,890 --> 04:17:20,670
Oh, no, just kidding.

4062
04:17:20,790 --> 04:17:21,530
This is another room.

4063
04:17:29,070 --> 04:17:31,550
Really loved all your streams and watching you play different games.

4064
04:17:32,170 --> 04:17:37,090
You really made my last two weeks by playing this and doing the USS Hornet stream.

4065
04:17:37,170 --> 04:17:37,610
Thank you so much.

4066
04:17:37,610 --> 04:17:38,930
I'm glad you like it.

4067
04:17:39,010 --> 04:17:41,010
Also, congrats on 3k milestone.

4068
04:17:41,150 --> 04:17:41,730
Thank you!

4069
04:17:46,150 --> 04:17:47,190
Alright.

4070
04:17:47,190 --> 04:17:49,830
We're gonna shine...

4071
04:17:49,830 --> 04:17:51,050
on here.

4072
04:17:53,130 --> 04:17:54,150
Or there.

4073
04:17:56,050 --> 04:17:56,670
OK.

4074
04:17:57,230 --> 04:17:58,270
How do we...

4075
04:18:02,660 --> 04:18:03,180
OK.

4076
04:18:03,760 --> 04:18:04,280
Interesting.

4077
04:18:04,960 --> 04:18:05,640
Hmm.

4078
04:18:07,660 --> 04:18:08,620
Oh my god.

4079
04:18:08,720 --> 04:18:09,120
What?

4080
04:18:09,260 --> 04:18:10,780
You're afraid of sunlight, Gina?

4081
04:18:10,960 --> 04:18:11,440
Come on.

4082
04:18:15,770 --> 04:18:16,450
Oh.

4083
04:18:22,170 --> 04:18:22,850
OK.

4084
04:18:27,370 --> 04:18:28,510
I'm trying.

4085
04:18:29,150 --> 04:18:30,250
I'm trying.

4086
04:18:30,370 --> 04:18:32,570
I'm doing as much as I can.

4087
04:18:36,570 --> 04:18:37,930
You're broken.

4088
04:18:42,470 --> 04:18:43,510
We need...

4089
04:18:45,210 --> 04:18:45,890
Yeah.

4090
04:18:46,810 --> 04:18:48,070
We need to find the mirror.

4091
04:18:49,410 --> 04:18:51,130
Did you guys see one before?

4092
04:18:53,030 --> 04:18:55,590
Did you guys see a mirror at all anywhere?

4093
04:19:02,430 --> 04:19:03,450
In here?

4094
04:19:05,750 --> 04:19:07,250
Wait, we need... Oh, OK.

4095
04:19:10,130 --> 04:19:10,570
Man.

4096
04:19:15,930 --> 04:19:18,170
With such ease!

4097
04:19:27,280 --> 04:19:28,660
Are you sure?

4098
04:19:28,860 --> 04:19:29,640
I can throw it.

4099
04:19:33,460 --> 04:19:34,980
That was fast.

4100
04:19:40,080 --> 04:19:41,280
Thank you!

4101
04:19:46,660 --> 04:19:47,680
I'm not.

4102
04:19:56,810 --> 04:19:58,690
Wait, you got another one?

4103
04:20:07,050 --> 04:20:08,470
Oh my god.

4104
04:20:08,550 --> 04:20:10,050
Gina, you should have done it in there.

4105
04:20:10,790 --> 04:20:11,030
Gina!

4106
04:20:19,890 --> 04:20:20,250
OK.

4107
04:20:20,950 --> 04:20:21,650
Wait, hold on.

4108
04:20:21,670 --> 04:20:22,390
Let me get my stuff.

4109
04:20:22,910 --> 04:20:25,150
Where did I put my... Oh, there it is.

4110
04:20:25,210 --> 04:20:25,850
My torch.

4111
04:20:26,670 --> 04:20:26,970
Alright.

4112
04:20:28,950 --> 04:20:29,490
Poor Gina.

4113
04:20:29,610 --> 04:20:31,090
We could have done it as intended.

4114
04:20:34,750 --> 04:20:35,390
Alright, Gina.

4115
04:20:35,630 --> 04:20:36,430
Do your job.

4116
04:20:36,850 --> 04:20:37,830
Don't shine it at me.

4117
04:20:38,350 --> 04:20:39,870
Shine it at the thing.

4118
04:20:40,570 --> 04:20:42,770
Gina, I need you to tilt your body a little bit more.

4119
04:20:42,870 --> 04:20:43,230
Oh, OK.

4120
04:20:44,550 --> 04:20:45,530
It's working.

4121
04:20:46,610 --> 04:20:47,950
It's opening the door.

4122
04:20:50,570 --> 04:20:51,270
Gina?

4123
04:20:54,770 --> 04:20:56,630
Statue of Light puzzle complete!

4124
04:20:59,150 --> 04:21:01,070
I'm surprised it stayed open.

4125
04:21:05,560 --> 04:21:06,900
What's in there?

4126
04:21:07,840 --> 04:21:10,160
Gina, did you find any Among Us statues?

4127
04:21:17,760 --> 04:21:22,580
Guardians must have been highly regarded by the kings of ancient Egypt to be treated like this.

4128
04:21:24,040 --> 04:21:26,180
I feel like we can go in here, right?

4129
04:21:28,680 --> 04:21:30,620
I feel like we can go in there.

4130
04:21:31,580 --> 04:21:32,700
It's fine though.

4131
04:21:33,920 --> 04:21:35,300
Let's continue onwards.

4132
04:21:35,680 --> 04:21:36,940
What's this scary music for?

4133
04:21:41,460 --> 04:21:42,540
Why is it scary?

4134
04:21:43,020 --> 04:21:44,060
Why is it so scary?

4135
04:21:44,500 --> 04:21:45,760
What happened to your torch?

4136
04:21:46,380 --> 04:21:46,980
What?

4137
04:21:47,260 --> 04:21:48,120
Girl?

4138
04:21:52,260 --> 04:21:54,720
Here we go.

4139
04:22:00,570 --> 04:22:02,550
Another mirror?

4140
04:22:03,150 --> 04:22:07,350
She looks so scary when she crawls through.

4141
04:22:13,050 --> 04:22:14,850
You think?

4142
04:22:15,930 --> 04:22:18,090
How do you figure that?

4143
04:22:20,450 --> 04:22:23,650
Oh, the room where we came in!

4144
04:22:26,970 --> 04:22:33,390
I thought she meant the room where we sat in the big chair.

4145
04:22:34,250 --> 04:22:36,370
That looks like a sussy Among Us!

4146
04:22:40,390 --> 04:22:41,070
Beautiful.

4147
04:22:41,070 --> 04:22:41,150
Beautiful.

4148
04:22:46,750 --> 04:22:49,330
This is the room that we were looking into!

4149
04:22:51,630 --> 04:22:53,710
So we did end up making it over.

4150
04:22:54,370 --> 04:22:55,170
Good job guys.

4151
04:22:58,330 --> 04:22:59,430
Sussy Ohio.

4152
04:23:05,780 --> 04:23:06,380
Alright.

4153
04:23:12,280 --> 04:23:12,880
Safely...

4154
04:23:20,300 --> 04:23:20,820
Carefully...

4155
04:23:20,820 --> 04:23:25,080
I think if I fell down there I'd be fine.

4156
04:23:25,980 --> 04:23:26,680
I think.

4157
04:23:29,920 --> 04:23:31,260
What are you doing?

4158
04:23:32,300 --> 04:23:32,880
What do you want?

4159
04:23:37,060 --> 04:23:39,600
I was just going to do what we did before.

4160
04:23:41,660 --> 04:23:42,300
Fine.

4161
04:23:44,800 --> 04:23:46,160
Where are the snakes?

4162
04:23:46,660 --> 04:23:48,620
We already had a single snake.

4163
04:23:49,000 --> 04:23:52,120
Singular snake.

4164
04:24:00,460 --> 04:24:01,100
Why?

4165
04:24:02,640 --> 04:24:04,500
Why can't I just do this again?

4166
04:24:06,380 --> 04:24:08,020
What do you mean go around?

4167
04:24:14,660 --> 04:24:16,200
What do you mean go around?

4168
04:24:24,780 --> 04:24:27,760
Am I not seeing the correct...

4169
04:24:29,880 --> 04:24:32,020
Prove you'll be fine and fall?

4170
04:24:37,960 --> 04:24:39,160
Look at this guy.

4171
04:24:39,440 --> 04:24:40,500
Are you tough or something?

4172
04:24:40,860 --> 04:24:41,680
You're stuck in the floor?

4173
04:24:42,360 --> 04:24:44,280
Look at you guys, sinking into the floor.

4174
04:24:47,460 --> 04:24:48,340
Ok, hold on.

4175
04:24:48,840 --> 04:24:49,620
I should pay attention.

4176
04:24:49,720 --> 04:24:50,360
What are we doing here?

4177
04:24:57,570 --> 04:24:58,950
Does she want me to...

4178
04:25:02,690 --> 04:25:04,510
What do they eat down here?

4179
04:25:05,150 --> 04:25:06,350
Us, apparently.

4180
04:25:08,050 --> 04:25:10,510
That's why they're so hungry for us.

4181
04:25:11,010 --> 04:25:12,170
They're like, oh finally.

4182
04:25:13,110 --> 04:25:14,210
More food.

4183
04:25:16,750 --> 04:25:18,670
I'm trying to figure out where I go.

4184
04:25:20,790 --> 04:25:22,330
Do I swing to these?

4185
04:25:26,030 --> 04:25:28,170
She clearly wants you under the light.

4186
04:25:28,170 --> 04:25:30,170
Yeah, well...

4187
04:25:31,070 --> 04:25:32,490
There's nothing over here.

4188
04:25:33,430 --> 04:25:36,750
She said I'll try and distract them, but she's not doing a very good job.

4189
04:25:36,830 --> 04:25:38,390
I'm holding my own.

4190
04:25:40,110 --> 04:25:42,070
And I'm not sure where to go.

4191
04:25:44,790 --> 04:25:46,350
Oh my god.

4192
04:25:52,050 --> 04:25:53,070
Wait, hold on.

4193
04:25:53,770 --> 04:25:56,050
Ma'am, I would like to throw my...

4194
04:26:00,840 --> 04:26:01,540
Oh, hi.

4195
04:26:02,660 --> 04:26:05,880
Can I get my... Can I get my torch back, please?

4196
04:26:08,660 --> 04:26:09,460
My torch!

4197
04:26:14,970 --> 04:26:15,730
It's right there.

4198
04:26:15,770 --> 04:26:16,390
Oh, I got it.

4199
04:26:16,890 --> 04:26:17,390
I see it.

4200
04:26:17,630 --> 04:26:17,990
Come on.

4201
04:26:18,310 --> 04:26:18,990
It's so close.

4202
04:26:19,410 --> 04:26:21,670
If I grab it, I can throw it, you guys.

4203
04:26:22,230 --> 04:26:23,330
I'll throw it over there.

4204
04:26:23,870 --> 04:26:24,170
You know?

4205
04:26:28,570 --> 04:26:29,750
I just gotta get it.

4206
04:26:30,130 --> 04:26:31,110
I just gotta get it.

4207
04:26:31,110 --> 04:26:33,110
I just gotta get my torch.

4208
04:26:33,670 --> 04:26:35,350
You're not doing a very good job, Gina.

4209
04:26:35,490 --> 04:26:37,050
Please, I'm down here now.

4210
04:26:39,410 --> 04:26:39,930
Come

4211
04:26:43,800 --> 04:26:45,080
on, it's right there.

4212
04:26:45,740 --> 04:26:46,560
It's like pixel.

4213
04:26:53,620 --> 04:26:54,100
I'm trying.

4214
04:26:55,940 --> 04:26:57,320
You all doubted me.

4215
04:27:07,480 --> 04:27:08,740
Are you OK?

4216
04:27:11,740 --> 04:27:12,260
Alright.

4217
04:27:13,240 --> 04:27:15,020
Watch my toesies.

4218
04:27:15,960 --> 04:27:17,540
I mean my fingies.

4219
04:27:22,630 --> 04:27:23,270
OK.

4220
04:27:24,570 --> 04:27:25,150
Over.

4221
04:27:27,790 --> 04:27:29,190
And...

4222
04:27:31,910 --> 04:27:33,310
And...

4223
04:27:48,240 --> 04:27:49,640
Be gone, beasts!

4224
04:27:49,900 --> 04:27:50,660
Be gone!

4225
04:27:50,900 --> 04:27:51,900
Be gone, beasts!

4226
04:27:51,980 --> 04:27:52,560
Be gone!

4227
04:27:53,360 --> 04:27:54,520
Be gone, beasts!

4228
04:27:55,000 --> 04:27:55,640
Be gone!

4229
04:27:55,760 --> 04:27:56,680
Be gone, beasts!

4230
04:27:56,980 --> 04:27:57,680
Be gone!

4231
04:28:01,420 --> 04:28:02,700
Am I?

4232
04:28:04,460 --> 04:28:06,800
They respawn so fast.

4233
04:28:08,820 --> 04:28:10,560
Alright, I want out of here.

4234
04:28:13,580 --> 04:28:14,680
What's that sound?

4235
04:28:15,240 --> 04:28:22,100
Thanks so much.

4236
04:28:25,460 --> 04:28:26,840
I thought I heard voices.

4237
04:28:31,300 --> 04:28:32,180
I guess not.

4238
04:28:34,840 --> 04:28:36,240
These books?

4239
04:28:37,240 --> 04:28:38,640
Not books, but you know what I mean.

4240
04:28:41,580 --> 04:28:42,720
The stele!

4241
04:28:42,720 --> 04:28:42,840
Really?

4242
04:28:45,340 --> 04:28:49,560
A scene with a winged guardian-like figure watching over a ruler.

4243
04:28:49,560 --> 04:28:51,560
Stealing with a guardian motif.

4244
04:29:14,160 --> 04:29:16,000
She's like, yeah, don't disturb it.

4245
04:29:16,260 --> 04:29:17,760
He's like, belongs in a museum.

4246
04:29:20,120 --> 04:29:21,420
Come on, Gina.

4247
04:29:21,740 --> 04:29:23,340
OK, you can jump.

4248
04:29:24,200 --> 04:29:24,900
You got this, girl.

4249
04:29:27,520 --> 04:29:29,240
I'm hearing like a...

4250
04:29:29,760 --> 04:29:30,960
I don't know what I'm hearing.

4251
04:29:36,540 --> 04:29:37,100
Sand?

4252
04:29:42,290 --> 04:29:44,690
Something in here is going...

4253
04:29:44,690 --> 04:29:46,610
Do you guys hear it?

4254
04:29:58,280 --> 04:30:00,720
There's something in here that's like...

4255
04:30:00,720 --> 04:30:02,200
Something over here.

4256
04:30:02,300 --> 04:30:03,360
I hear it.

4257
04:30:05,660 --> 04:30:07,380
Every time I walk away.

4258
04:30:11,840 --> 04:30:14,360
Oh my god, that's my torch.

4259
04:30:14,680 --> 04:30:15,740
Where is she going?

4260
04:30:17,080 --> 04:30:17,320
Gina?

4261
04:30:21,270 --> 04:30:22,670
You guys heard that.

4262
04:30:27,320 --> 04:30:28,040
Gina?

4263
04:30:29,600 --> 04:30:31,380
I'm afraid you're possessed.

4264
04:30:34,480 --> 04:30:36,120
I must kill you now.

4265
04:30:40,990 --> 04:30:41,590
Oh, we're back.

4266
04:30:49,610 --> 04:30:51,970
Or you can pull yourself up.

4267
04:30:52,710 --> 04:30:55,590
Like I had to do every single time.

4268
04:30:56,150 --> 04:30:57,310
Oh, it's so bright.

4269
04:30:57,510 --> 04:30:58,730
Ow, my eyes.

4270
04:31:13,710 --> 04:31:15,010
Love your butt.

4271
04:31:16,110 --> 04:31:16,990
What's wrong?

4272
04:31:17,390 --> 04:31:18,370
Indy, what's wrong?

4273
04:31:20,770 --> 04:31:22,070
Wally, happy birthday!

4274
04:31:23,630 --> 04:31:25,750
Hold on, I'll sing you happy birthday after this cutscene.

4275
04:31:28,050 --> 04:31:29,590
And I'm gonna eat some more dinner.

4276
04:31:46,470 --> 04:31:47,170
From the past.

4277
04:32:09,200 --> 04:32:10,400
Is this...?

4278
04:32:10,400 --> 04:32:11,520
Is this supposed to be Riz?

4279
04:32:15,960 --> 04:32:16,920
Archaeologist Riz?

4280
04:32:28,830 --> 04:32:30,230
What?

4281
04:32:36,450 --> 04:32:37,070
Yes, Rambo!

4282
04:33:01,700 --> 04:33:02,820
Sanctuary of the Guardians.

4283
04:33:23,100 --> 04:33:27,200
Oh man, oh wow, that's a lot of...

4284
04:33:27,200 --> 04:33:28,580
Okay, so we got one Sealy.

4285
04:33:31,420 --> 04:33:32,200
Hold on.

4286
04:33:33,220 --> 04:33:38,320
So that field work is technically done, but it also got us a Sealy, so we needed to do it anyway.

4287
04:33:38,880 --> 04:33:41,420
And then there's this...

4288
04:33:41,420 --> 04:33:45,400
Okay, these are the side quests, whatever, whatever.

4289
04:33:48,020 --> 04:33:50,280
Boss makes a dollar while I make a dime.

4290
04:33:50,360 --> 04:33:52,420
That's why I watch Minky on company time!

4291
04:33:53,820 --> 04:33:55,700
Thank you, Gordon Freeman.

4292
04:33:56,220 --> 04:33:57,700
Thank you for the superchat.

4293
04:33:58,060 --> 04:33:59,620
Hope you have a good day at work.

4294
04:34:02,620 --> 04:34:04,180
Oh, it says village dog.

4295
04:34:04,320 --> 04:34:05,880
I definitely thought it said hot dog.

4296
04:34:06,620 --> 04:34:08,000
Seat of Eternity.

4297
04:34:08,600 --> 04:34:09,460
Oh, that's right!

4298
04:34:10,300 --> 04:34:12,300
I'm actually kind of curious about this one.

4299
04:34:14,320 --> 04:34:15,900
Maybe we go check this one out.

4300
04:34:17,060 --> 04:34:18,600
Wait, where did we come out from?

4301
04:34:18,940 --> 04:34:19,200
Hello?

4302
04:34:20,200 --> 04:34:20,520
Okay.

4303
04:34:23,440 --> 04:34:26,640
These guys are still slackers!

4304
04:34:27,280 --> 04:34:28,500
Slackers, all of you!

4305
04:34:30,940 --> 04:34:32,580
Oh, this guy's got a dog.

4306
04:34:34,000 --> 04:34:35,600
You don't think the dog will notice, right?

4307
04:34:38,080 --> 04:34:39,460
Walking with Moxie!

4308
04:34:39,920 --> 04:34:41,180
Walking with Moxie!

4309
04:34:42,300 --> 04:34:42,820
Yeah, see?

4310
04:34:46,500 --> 04:34:48,600
I'm kind of curious about this area.

4311
04:34:50,660 --> 04:34:52,820
You don't think they'll notice all the people that are dead there, right?

4312
04:34:52,820 --> 04:34:52,860
Right?

4313
04:35:00,620 --> 04:35:02,080
And then for the other thing.

4314
04:35:02,160 --> 04:35:04,640
Well, we'll go over here and look what this is and then...

4315
04:35:04,640 --> 04:35:05,820
They said it was abandoned, right?

4316
04:35:06,040 --> 04:35:07,920
And then that there was a bunch of wild dogs.

4317
04:35:12,050 --> 04:35:13,450
We can get through the dogs.

4318
04:35:15,170 --> 04:35:16,490
I got my handy whip.

4319
04:35:19,030 --> 04:35:21,790
And then we'll see how close we are to some of the other Steelies.

4320
04:35:24,310 --> 04:35:24,930
Right there?

4321
04:35:25,790 --> 04:35:29,130
This is abandoned, but there's a train going to it.

4322
04:35:31,730 --> 04:35:34,190
How would it be abandoned if there are dogs?

4323
04:35:34,390 --> 04:35:35,330
Oh, here!

4324
04:35:36,150 --> 04:35:37,510
Wait, what are they chomping on?

4325
04:35:43,120 --> 04:35:43,680
Oh,

4326
04:35:46,920 --> 04:35:47,800
they're not afraid of this.

4327
04:35:50,060 --> 04:35:50,620
Down,

4328
04:36:04,040 --> 04:36:04,220
boy!

4329
04:36:04,500 --> 04:36:04,900
Down!

4330
04:36:05,740 --> 04:36:06,460
That's right.

4331
04:36:09,120 --> 04:36:09,500
Oh.

4332
04:36:09,760 --> 04:36:12,920
Oh, it's...

4333
04:36:12,920 --> 04:36:15,840
Oh my god.

4334
04:36:16,220 --> 04:36:16,460
I'm

4335
04:36:21,190 --> 04:36:22,290
gonna die to this dog.

4336
04:36:27,900 --> 04:36:30,880
Here I was appreciating your craft.

4337
04:36:33,100 --> 04:36:34,240
Take this.

4338
04:36:35,660 --> 04:36:40,820
I was appreciating what you've done to this person.

4339
04:36:42,240 --> 04:36:43,380
And you're floating.

4340
04:36:44,000 --> 04:36:44,200
Why?

4341
04:36:44,320 --> 04:36:45,180
How are you doing that?

4342
04:36:46,200 --> 04:36:47,360
What's in here?

4343
04:36:49,680 --> 04:36:51,720
I'm gonna go and be adventurous.

4344
04:37:04,780 --> 04:37:06,540
Apparently, there's nothing.

4345
04:37:08,900 --> 04:37:10,280
Oh, there is two adventure.

4346
04:37:13,500 --> 04:37:14,900
Can I...?

4347
04:37:16,160 --> 04:37:19,060
I have no idea where I am, but...

4348
04:37:19,060 --> 04:37:20,720
Wait, lower yourself a little Indy.

4349
04:37:20,840 --> 04:37:21,420
There you go.

4350
04:37:26,140 --> 04:37:26,900
Singular boi!

4351
04:37:27,500 --> 04:37:28,140
What did you say?

4352
04:37:28,860 --> 04:37:29,340
What did you say?

4353
04:37:29,420 --> 04:37:29,660
Sorry.

4354
04:37:29,660 --> 04:37:35,140
I can't believe on the same day I proposed to my girlfriend of 10 years!

4355
04:37:37,740 --> 04:37:39,360
Our girlfriend.

4356
04:37:43,000 --> 04:37:43,840
Congratulations!

4357
04:37:47,000 --> 04:37:47,840
Congratulations!

4358
04:37:50,380 --> 04:37:50,940
What's this?

4359
04:37:55,540 --> 04:37:57,280
Open the sarcophagus?

4360
04:37:57,520 --> 04:37:58,480
Where am I?

4361
04:37:59,660 --> 04:38:00,620
Tomb journal?

4362
04:38:02,280 --> 04:38:02,980
What?

4363
04:38:04,420 --> 04:38:05,180
What?

4364
04:38:29,660 --> 04:38:30,420
But I don't.

4365
04:38:30,760 --> 04:38:32,320
According to the local...

4366
04:38:35,080 --> 04:38:37,360
The tombs around here are haunted!

4367
04:38:38,200 --> 04:38:38,960
Or cursed.

4368
04:38:39,520 --> 04:38:41,360
Obviously complete and utter humbug.

4369
04:38:42,680 --> 04:38:47,180
Attaching a little nonsense ghost story to any artifact I find should double its value.

4370
04:38:47,720 --> 04:38:49,600
It's getting late and I thought I heard something outside.

4371
04:38:49,980 --> 04:38:51,640
Might not get much sleep tonight.

4372
04:38:54,280 --> 04:38:54,680
Oof.

4373
04:38:54,680 --> 04:38:55,080
Ripperoni.

4374
04:38:59,340 --> 04:39:00,780
Can I open the sarcophagus?

4375
04:39:02,540 --> 04:39:04,140
That was the quest or was it not?

4376
04:39:04,440 --> 04:39:07,180
Oh wow, he even left all his toys and everything.

4377
04:39:09,520 --> 04:39:11,680
Oh wait, my chat is frozen guys.

4378
04:39:11,820 --> 04:39:12,540
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

4379
04:39:12,960 --> 04:39:13,760
Give me a second.

4380
04:39:14,700 --> 04:39:16,540
Let me refresh you all.

4381
04:39:28,670 --> 04:39:29,570
One moment.

4382
04:39:30,630 --> 04:39:31,710
So I can see.

4383
04:39:34,070 --> 04:39:34,910
There we go.

4384
04:39:36,750 --> 04:39:37,910
Toys and doodads.

4385
04:39:39,090 --> 04:39:39,890
How do I open it?

4386
04:39:42,410 --> 04:39:44,170
Open the sarcophagus it said.

4387
04:39:45,350 --> 04:39:46,650
But it left no instruction.

4388
04:39:47,450 --> 04:39:48,170
Where am I?

4389
04:39:50,610 --> 04:39:53,110
Oh I'm at the seat of eternity I suppose.

4390
04:39:53,110 --> 04:39:56,010
Can I open it?

4391
04:39:58,770 --> 04:39:59,850
I need more jars.

4392
04:40:00,170 --> 04:40:01,410
Oh you are right.

4393
04:40:01,810 --> 04:40:02,630
I see, I see.

4394
04:40:03,390 --> 04:40:05,170
Oh I need a lot more jars.

4395
04:40:05,310 --> 04:40:05,430
Ok.

4396
04:40:06,970 --> 04:40:07,570
Interesting.

4397
04:40:10,090 --> 04:40:11,710
Is he the correct one?

4398
04:40:12,110 --> 04:40:12,410
No.

4399
04:40:13,230 --> 04:40:13,870
Does it matter?

4400
04:40:14,490 --> 04:40:14,910
Maybe.

4401
04:40:18,230 --> 04:40:18,830
That.

4402
04:40:19,770 --> 04:40:20,530
That.

4403
04:40:23,940 --> 04:40:24,700
Ok.

4404
04:40:25,380 --> 04:40:27,860
Alright we got the correct one.

4405
04:40:29,300 --> 04:40:33,680
Well I guess I'll just leave and come back when it's...

4406
04:40:34,980 --> 04:40:36,220
When we get more.

4407
04:40:37,220 --> 04:40:38,760
This looks breakable doesn't it?

4408
04:40:40,000 --> 04:40:40,600
Oh yeah.

4409
04:40:41,220 --> 04:40:43,760
Oh that's extremely breakable.

4410
04:40:44,320 --> 04:40:46,080
Do we have any weapon?

4411
04:40:50,680 --> 04:40:51,320
This?

4412
04:40:52,040 --> 04:40:53,000
This?

4413
04:40:53,980 --> 04:40:54,540
This?

4414
04:40:55,940 --> 04:40:56,620
Nothing?

4415
04:40:57,020 --> 04:40:57,320
Really?

4416
04:40:58,820 --> 04:41:00,420
Thank you!

4417
04:41:00,900 --> 04:41:02,760
Can I get another birthday song from my friend Brandon?

4418
04:41:03,220 --> 04:41:04,420
His birthday was yesterday though.

4419
04:41:04,520 --> 04:41:05,620
Yeah I can!

4420
04:41:07,060 --> 04:41:10,660
Happy birthday to you!

4421
04:41:11,180 --> 04:41:13,660
Happy birthday to you!

4422
04:41:14,240 --> 04:41:17,160
Happy birthday dear Brandon!

4423
04:41:18,040 --> 04:41:20,560
From your friend Ichinobu!

4424
04:41:20,920 --> 04:41:24,620
Happy birthday to you!

4425
04:41:26,260 --> 04:41:27,600
Happy birthday!

4426
04:41:30,280 --> 04:41:31,680
I'm gonna jump!

4427
04:41:34,840 --> 04:41:35,220
Alright.

4428
04:41:38,400 --> 04:41:42,820
I'm just gonna yeet the ancient Egyptian relic.

4429
04:41:43,680 --> 04:41:47,420
Oh good thing it's really sturdy.

4430
04:41:48,520 --> 04:41:50,120
And...

4431
04:41:50,120 --> 04:41:51,680
Nice.

4432
04:41:54,860 --> 04:41:55,560
And...

4433
04:41:57,820 --> 04:41:59,180
Nice.

4434
04:42:00,500 --> 04:42:01,900
And...

4435
04:42:03,380 --> 04:42:04,780
I...

4436
04:42:04,780 --> 04:42:06,260
Wait...

4437
04:42:10,240 --> 04:42:13,040
I then...

4438
04:42:13,040 --> 04:42:16,480
Uh oh.

4439
04:42:20,600 --> 04:42:21,100
Oh there we go.

4440
04:42:21,220 --> 04:42:24,860
I thought it wouldn't allow me to whip it.

4441
04:42:25,840 --> 04:42:27,220
We're fine!

4442
04:42:27,840 --> 04:42:29,300
We stay here forever.

4443
04:42:32,920 --> 04:42:33,500
Okay.

4444
04:42:36,420 --> 04:42:37,590
This goes...

4445
04:42:43,570 --> 04:42:44,570
What about this?

4446
04:42:45,790 --> 04:42:47,670
Is that a human face?

4447
04:42:47,670 --> 04:42:49,430
Oh no no no no!

4448
04:42:49,690 --> 04:42:50,810
That's a human face.

4449
04:42:52,490 --> 04:42:53,090
Perfect.

4450
04:42:56,530 --> 04:43:00,630
It could have been a really ugly person is all I'm saying.

4451
04:43:04,950 --> 04:43:07,830
Could have been some guy with a really ugly mug.

4452
04:43:10,350 --> 04:43:12,250
Okay it doesn't have any secrets.

4453
04:43:16,750 --> 04:43:17,690
Another one!

4454
04:43:20,450 --> 04:43:22,550
Oh it was a minky!

4455
04:43:29,010 --> 04:43:34,940
I don't think that was a glitch.

4456
04:43:45,400 --> 04:43:46,400
Indy?

4457
04:43:48,040 --> 04:43:49,020
You okay buddy?

4458
04:43:54,410 --> 04:43:55,410
You wanna...

4459
04:43:55,990 --> 04:43:57,690
You wanna little...

4460
04:43:57,690 --> 04:43:59,710
You wanna prickly pear?

4461
04:44:07,760 --> 04:44:08,900
I'm scared.

4462
04:44:08,900 --> 04:44:10,340
Are we getting cursed?

4463
04:44:10,740 --> 04:44:11,660
They said it was haunted.

4464
04:44:12,400 --> 04:44:12,920
What was that?

4465
04:44:16,130 --> 04:44:18,330
I think it's just a sound effect.

4466
04:44:19,430 --> 04:44:22,590
So we have one last one left.

4467
04:44:24,510 --> 04:44:26,550
This one, but it's also mysterious.

4468
04:44:27,270 --> 04:44:28,410
Not sure what it is.

4469
04:44:30,110 --> 04:44:31,270
I'm scared.

4470
04:44:31,890 --> 04:44:33,010
What happened?

4471
04:44:34,130 --> 04:44:35,370
That was kinda freaky.

4472
04:44:38,210 --> 04:44:39,250
Oh my god.

4473
04:44:39,250 --> 04:44:39,950
Hello?

4474
04:44:43,830 --> 04:44:44,590
Hello?

4475
04:44:45,590 --> 04:44:46,250
I'm just...

4476
04:44:46,870 --> 04:44:47,970
Like it's soccer balls?

4477
04:44:58,690 --> 04:45:01,890
I don't see where one more could be.

4478
04:45:03,010 --> 04:45:03,790
It's not that.

4479
04:45:12,850 --> 04:45:14,130
Is it this guy?

4480
04:45:14,450 --> 04:45:15,450
Maybe I destroy you.

4481
04:45:16,950 --> 04:45:17,510
Nope.

4482
04:45:18,590 --> 04:45:19,730
What could this be?

4483
04:45:21,890 --> 04:45:24,190
I don't see anymore breakable walls.

4484
04:45:27,150 --> 04:45:31,130
I thought maybe down there this one would be, but I don't think so.

4485
04:45:36,600 --> 04:45:37,720
That's just...

4486
04:45:37,720 --> 04:45:40,680
Look around?

4487
04:45:40,900 --> 04:45:41,500
What is there more?

4488
04:45:41,900 --> 04:45:42,800
And I'm just missing it?

4489
04:45:48,530 --> 04:45:49,690
I don't know.

4490
04:45:51,630 --> 04:45:53,350
A jar from the other room.

4491
04:45:54,750 --> 04:45:55,850
Oh it's around?

4492
04:45:56,010 --> 04:45:56,150
Really?

4493
04:45:57,710 --> 04:45:58,730
Just missing it for real?

4494
04:46:00,490 --> 04:46:02,090
What jar from the other room?

4495
04:46:05,540 --> 04:46:06,800
Oh my god.

4496
04:46:12,190 --> 04:46:14,210
What are these made of?

4497
04:46:16,890 --> 04:46:18,130
I think...

4498
04:46:20,920 --> 04:46:24,180
Ancient Egyptian technology is just something else.

4499
04:46:24,440 --> 04:46:27,980
Can I get a hint for anybody who knows?

4500
04:46:31,960 --> 04:46:33,220
It's inside.

4501
04:46:35,520 --> 04:46:36,300
Nope.

4502
04:46:36,920 --> 04:46:37,720
Nothing in there.

4503
04:46:39,260 --> 04:46:40,480
Swing across?

4504
04:46:42,400 --> 04:46:44,000
Check the other side of the hole.

4505
04:46:49,980 --> 04:46:50,480
Ah!

4506
04:47:06,460 --> 04:47:07,900
How mysterious.

4507
04:47:10,280 --> 04:47:11,240
And throw!

4508
04:47:12,480 --> 04:47:13,840
Good one Indy!

4509
04:47:18,900 --> 04:47:20,880
I'm surprised I made that.

4510
04:47:21,360 --> 04:47:22,000
Thank you guys.

4511
04:47:22,380 --> 04:47:23,800
I completely forgot about that other room.

4512
04:47:54,340 --> 04:47:57,060
Not even a skeleton.

4513
04:47:57,200 --> 04:48:01,680
It was completely empty.

4514
04:48:03,340 --> 04:48:05,420
What a waste.

4515
04:48:06,280 --> 04:48:07,140
Oh no, the dogs.

4516
04:48:08,840 --> 04:48:09,360
Come on.

4517
04:48:10,900 --> 04:48:14,160
The dogs are...

4518
04:48:14,160 --> 04:48:15,680
gone.

4519
04:48:17,380 --> 04:48:17,780
Ok.

4520
04:48:19,740 --> 04:48:20,840
Actually that works.

4521
04:48:20,840 --> 04:48:23,440
Even in the past, there is sus.

4522
04:48:26,520 --> 04:48:28,980
Even in the past, there is sus.

4523
04:48:30,520 --> 04:48:32,840
This is still just...

4524
04:48:35,580 --> 04:48:40,780
Alright, we are collecting the things of Ra.

4525
04:48:40,980 --> 04:48:44,040
The first one is right over here, so lucky it's pretty close.

4526
04:48:46,240 --> 04:48:48,620
And the others...

4527
04:48:48,620 --> 04:48:51,500
Oh wow, they are really scattered.

4528
04:48:52,960 --> 04:48:54,600
The idols of Ra.

4529
04:48:55,680 --> 04:48:56,300
Here?

4530
04:48:58,400 --> 04:48:59,720
Where I'm standing.

4531
04:48:59,960 --> 04:49:02,080
Oh, underneath where I'm standing.

4532
04:49:04,000 --> 04:49:04,980
I'll take you.

4533
04:49:20,850 --> 04:49:21,490
Spooky.

4534
04:49:21,750 --> 04:49:23,190
Oh, I have to set this on fire.

4535
04:49:24,790 --> 04:49:25,710
Very good.

4536
04:49:27,790 --> 04:49:30,150
The world's most powerful lighter.

4537
04:49:34,190 --> 04:49:38,390
I don't think we want to fall in there guys, but...

4538
04:49:38,390 --> 04:49:40,190
How do we open the door?

4539
04:49:46,690 --> 04:49:48,690
The archeologist is crying right now.

4540
04:49:48,730 --> 04:49:49,930
I am an archeologist!

4541
04:49:54,930 --> 04:49:57,470
I think right there.

4542
04:49:58,990 --> 04:49:59,710
Ok, let's see.

4543
04:50:03,610 --> 04:50:07,070
Alright, lower, lower, lower, lower.

4544
04:50:07,630 --> 04:50:08,630
Alright, nice.

4545
04:50:09,090 --> 04:50:09,750
Good job, Indy.

4546
04:50:11,370 --> 04:50:14,170
I hope everybody who does this has a whip.

4547
04:50:16,890 --> 04:50:17,570
Nice.

4548
04:50:24,900 --> 04:50:25,440
Nice.

4549
04:50:25,440 --> 04:50:27,060
There is a lot of poor saps in there.

4550
04:50:27,680 --> 04:50:28,620
Not us though.

4551
04:50:38,360 --> 04:50:38,900
Nice.

4552
04:50:40,240 --> 04:50:43,680
We can use that for the previous puzzle.

4553
04:50:45,100 --> 04:50:46,720
They are all just right here.

4554
04:50:46,920 --> 04:50:47,600
Oh, we got it.

4555
04:50:48,820 --> 04:50:49,420
Steely!

4556
04:50:50,120 --> 04:50:54,520
A servant feeding a sacred crocodile for Sebek, the fertility god.

4557
04:50:57,440 --> 04:50:58,040
Steely.

4558
04:50:59,100 --> 04:51:00,880
Hi, Steely the Steely.

4559
04:51:05,020 --> 04:51:06,300
Fertility god, eh?

4560
04:51:11,470 --> 04:51:13,930
Oh my god, I didn't think I was going to make that for a second.

4561
04:51:17,010 --> 04:51:17,690
Alright.

4562
04:51:19,310 --> 04:51:29,090
I love these super foam, totally whatever piles of bricks.

4563
04:51:30,370 --> 04:51:31,950
Wait, 2 out of 4?

4564
04:51:34,470 --> 04:51:36,510
So I can go to whichever ones I want.

4565
04:51:37,130 --> 04:51:43,270
This one is right here, but it is kind of in a difficult location.

4566
04:51:45,350 --> 04:51:46,230
I don't know.

4567
04:51:48,530 --> 04:51:49,730
Do you think they will let us in?

4568
04:51:50,590 --> 04:51:51,790
I don't think it is the pyramid.

4569
04:51:52,530 --> 04:51:54,150
It is right in front of us.

4570
04:51:56,910 --> 04:51:58,690
Do we have to get all the Steelys?

4571
04:51:59,710 --> 04:52:01,010
I am still in my disguise.

4572
04:52:01,590 --> 04:52:02,230
I might be okay.

4573
04:52:04,570 --> 04:52:05,370
Hello everybody.

4574
04:52:10,340 --> 04:52:11,480
Where is the Steely?

4575
04:52:12,860 --> 04:52:13,800
Is it in here?

4576
04:52:23,620 --> 04:52:24,320
Shit!

4577
04:52:47,470 --> 04:52:48,310
That will do it.

4578
04:52:48,670 --> 04:52:49,930
That will do, Donkey.

4579
04:52:50,710 --> 04:52:51,490
That will do.

4580
04:53:00,930 --> 04:53:02,030
No one noticed.

4581
04:53:03,530 --> 04:53:03,950
All good.

4582
04:53:04,910 --> 04:53:07,870
Anyway, can we...

4583
04:53:08,410 --> 04:53:12,030
Do we have any secrets around here?

4584
04:53:14,970 --> 04:53:17,130
Any lock codes?

4585
04:53:17,130 --> 04:53:20,370
If I were a lock code, I would be on here.

4586
04:53:23,030 --> 04:53:23,710
0805.

4587
04:53:23,790 --> 04:53:24,310
Thank you.

4588
04:53:24,670 --> 04:53:26,510
Wait, locker?

4589
04:53:27,030 --> 04:53:27,250
No.

4590
04:53:28,490 --> 04:53:29,030
This one.

4591
04:53:36,710 --> 04:53:38,890
0805 Bingo!

4592
04:53:41,530 --> 04:53:45,410
A depiction of a bountiful harvest and the people reaping the rewards.

4593
04:53:48,250 --> 04:53:49,090
Steely!

4594
04:53:50,830 --> 04:53:51,670
Anyway...

4595
04:53:53,210 --> 04:53:54,350
No money?

4596
04:53:54,910 --> 04:53:56,130
I don't think...

4597
04:53:57,050 --> 04:53:58,510
I thought I heard...

4598
04:53:58,510 --> 04:54:00,710
I thought I heard a car pull up.

4599
04:54:01,410 --> 04:54:03,150
Is there anything else in here to Steely?

4600
04:54:05,470 --> 04:54:06,050
Anything?

4601
04:54:06,870 --> 04:54:09,230
You guys got...

4602
04:54:09,230 --> 04:54:12,470
any interesting...

4603
04:54:12,470 --> 04:54:14,590
stuff around?

4604
04:54:15,730 --> 04:54:16,730
Any money?

4605
04:54:17,670 --> 04:54:19,350
So I can buy more books?

4606
04:54:22,660 --> 04:54:23,800
Yeah, they are fine.

4607
04:54:23,900 --> 04:54:24,840
Probably, right?

4608
04:54:25,100 --> 04:54:26,280
Got any grapes?

4609
04:54:28,780 --> 04:54:30,300
There is nothing else in here.

4610
04:54:30,840 --> 04:54:32,080
That's so boring!

4611
04:54:33,940 --> 04:54:35,500
Lockbox, but you got to smash.

4612
04:54:35,560 --> 04:54:35,980
This guy?

4613
04:54:59,060 --> 04:55:00,000
What's over here?

4614
04:55:01,260 --> 04:55:02,020
Any money?

4615
04:55:03,580 --> 04:55:04,800
Any money, honey?

4616
04:55:06,100 --> 04:55:07,240
Any honey, money?

4617
04:55:09,160 --> 04:55:09,640
None.

4618
04:55:12,260 --> 04:55:14,800
Mint is now thinking, how many boxes did I skip?

4619
04:55:16,660 --> 04:55:17,140
Actually...

4620
04:55:17,140 --> 04:55:19,980
Well, I only noticed it for the first time in this stream.

4621
04:55:20,700 --> 04:55:22,280
I was like, oh yeah, huh?

4622
04:55:23,300 --> 04:55:25,280
There is a...

4623
04:55:25,280 --> 04:55:26,540
Ok, this thing is making me heavy.

4624
04:55:27,220 --> 04:55:27,680
Nevermind.

4625
04:55:29,020 --> 04:55:30,400
It's not making me any different.

4626
04:55:32,380 --> 04:55:32,880
Alright!

4627
04:55:34,200 --> 04:55:34,700
Nice!

4628
04:55:35,760 --> 04:55:37,000
Nice, nice, nice.

4629
04:55:39,160 --> 04:55:41,800
I only noticed it for the first time in this stream.

4630
04:55:42,640 --> 04:55:44,680
So I was like, oh...

4631
04:55:45,700 --> 04:55:47,020
Are they all talking in there?

4632
04:55:47,700 --> 04:55:49,600
Having a grand old time.

4633
04:55:50,580 --> 04:55:52,560
If I go in there, they will boss me around.

4634
04:55:53,720 --> 04:55:54,420
Oh wait!

4635
04:55:56,760 --> 04:55:57,260
Oh!

4636
04:55:57,880 --> 04:55:58,900
We are fine, maybe.

4637
04:55:59,660 --> 04:56:01,620
Oh, it's a recreational area.

4638
04:56:02,680 --> 04:56:04,700
There is sand in my shoes.

4639
04:56:13,440 --> 04:56:15,060
What is in here?

4640
04:56:15,880 --> 04:56:17,320
Can I steal a uniform in here?

4641
04:56:17,580 --> 04:56:18,020
You think?

4642
04:56:18,860 --> 04:56:19,720
Probably, right?

4643
04:56:21,300 --> 04:56:22,440
A disguise.

4644
04:56:23,780 --> 04:56:24,900
Or... 5!

4645
04:56:24,960 --> 04:56:25,500
That's it!

4646
04:56:25,840 --> 04:56:26,620
What is this currency?

4647
04:56:36,150 --> 04:56:36,750
20.

4648
04:56:48,400 --> 04:56:49,640
5 is 5.

4649
04:56:50,360 --> 04:56:50,920
Robux.

4650
04:56:51,000 --> 04:56:51,820
5 Robux.

4651
04:56:52,000 --> 04:56:53,100
Yeah, exactly.

4652
04:56:55,480 --> 04:56:57,320
I think I can take on this whole camp.

4653
04:56:58,980 --> 04:57:01,120
Why hasn't she written anything yet?

4654
04:57:06,120 --> 04:57:07,520
Guess I better get going.

4655
04:57:07,840 --> 04:57:09,000
No, sounds good.

4656
04:57:11,860 --> 04:57:12,900
We'll come back.

4657
04:57:12,900 --> 04:57:13,280
Very bad.

4658
04:57:17,480 --> 04:57:17,960
Alright.

4659
04:57:21,180 --> 04:57:22,620
I thought he was bullying a guy.

4660
04:57:23,680 --> 04:57:24,880
Ok, let's see.

4661
04:57:25,900 --> 04:57:28,080
The other one...

4662
04:57:28,080 --> 04:57:30,880
We can go that way, we can go that way.

4663
04:57:31,760 --> 04:57:33,000
That's towards the village.

4664
04:57:33,680 --> 04:57:34,540
All the way that way.

4665
04:57:34,640 --> 04:57:36,380
Let's go towards the village, maybe.

4666
04:57:36,380 --> 04:57:36,400
Really?

4667
04:57:41,100 --> 04:57:42,520
Egypt would be pounds.

4668
04:57:42,980 --> 04:57:45,080
They were part of the British Empire at the time.

4669
04:57:51,100 --> 04:57:52,140
Makes sense.

4670
04:57:56,880 --> 04:57:57,460
I see.

4671
04:58:00,560 --> 04:58:01,520
What's in here?

4672
04:58:02,900 --> 04:58:03,600
What is this area?

4673
04:58:04,440 --> 04:58:04,960
Camels!

4674
04:58:06,700 --> 04:58:07,880
They're so cute.

4675
04:58:08,620 --> 04:58:09,980
They're so precious.

4676
04:58:17,180 --> 04:58:19,660
Look at that goofy smile.

4677
04:58:20,540 --> 04:58:21,700
One thing I still think about.

4678
04:58:21,860 --> 04:58:23,920
Have you guys ever seen that video of that camel laughing?

4679
04:58:28,120 --> 04:58:29,220
You're locked in here?

4680
04:58:30,540 --> 04:58:31,980
Requires discarded key.

4681
04:58:31,980 --> 04:58:37,140
Are you sure you're not going to kill me once I let you out?

4682
04:58:38,460 --> 04:58:39,420
Discarded key?

4683
04:58:40,420 --> 04:58:41,660
You think it's amongst the poop?

4684
04:58:45,500 --> 04:58:49,440
Oh my gosh, if you've never seen the video of the camel laughing... That's a lot!

4685
04:58:49,880 --> 04:58:51,880
Why do they keep it in a basket?

4686
04:58:57,520 --> 04:58:59,080
I hope the key is around here.

4687
04:59:03,860 --> 04:59:04,960
Where is it?

4688
04:59:08,300 --> 04:59:08,980
A fertilizer!

4689
04:59:09,480 --> 04:59:10,380
That's so true.

4690
04:59:11,520 --> 04:59:13,000
I didn't think about that.

4691
04:59:14,360 --> 04:59:14,880
You're right.

4692
04:59:17,260 --> 04:59:18,360
A key, a key.

4693
04:59:19,140 --> 04:59:22,300
I'm trying to help you out buddy, but I need you to like...

4694
04:59:24,140 --> 04:59:26,300
I'm trying to find it!

4695
04:59:28,680 --> 04:59:31,320
The key is around the house.

4696
04:59:31,400 --> 04:59:31,780
It is?

4697
04:59:31,780 --> 04:59:31,860
Yes!

4698
04:59:35,340 --> 04:59:38,500
The key is around the house or it's near?

4699
04:59:41,520 --> 04:59:43,760
You guys know where the key is.

4700
04:59:43,880 --> 04:59:45,500
Wait, I can take a photo.

4701
04:59:46,680 --> 04:59:49,300
Hold on guys, this is much more important.

4702
04:59:51,400 --> 04:59:51,880
Camels.

4703
04:59:53,580 --> 04:59:54,320
Say cheese!

4704
04:59:54,800 --> 04:59:55,520
Look at me, look at me!

4705
04:59:55,900 --> 04:59:56,140
Nice.

4706
04:59:56,780 --> 04:59:57,580
Beautiful animals.

4707
04:59:58,120 --> 04:59:58,860
And useful.

4708
05:00:00,420 --> 05:00:01,220
Beautiful animals.

4709
05:00:02,780 --> 05:00:04,020
A key, a key.

4710
05:00:06,560 --> 05:00:09,360
If the key were in the poop, it would become Silent Hill 2.

4711
05:00:11,220 --> 05:00:14,100
Alright, come on Indiana Jones, time to reach your hand in the toilet.

4712
05:00:22,500 --> 05:00:23,860
I wish it would light up.

4713
05:00:25,440 --> 05:00:26,660
I'm looking, I'm looking.

4714
05:00:27,960 --> 05:00:29,040
You had it in your hand.

4715
05:00:29,100 --> 05:00:31,260
I'm not gonna lie, I totally thought the same thing.

4716
05:00:31,260 --> 05:00:33,780
I was like, I can just... I was like, stand back buddy!

4717
05:00:34,580 --> 05:00:35,660
I got you!

4718
05:00:42,380 --> 05:00:43,680
It is lit up?

4719
05:00:44,560 --> 05:00:46,580
Yeah, but I can't see if it is.

4720
05:00:48,340 --> 05:00:50,700
Oh, I like the sound of the wind in my ears.

4721
05:00:53,480 --> 05:00:56,160
Oh, sorry, this is not the correct mic for...

4722
05:00:57,160 --> 05:00:59,000
For ASMR wind blowing.

4723
05:00:59,960 --> 05:01:01,340
Can I have a hint?

4724
05:01:11,460 --> 05:01:13,760
Lots of trash around here.

4725
05:01:14,760 --> 05:01:15,840
Look up?

4726
05:01:17,480 --> 05:01:18,520
Is it that bird?

4727
05:01:28,160 --> 05:01:28,920
The

4728
05:01:46,510 --> 05:01:50,010
most powerful bird known to man.

4729
05:01:51,810 --> 05:01:53,890
Follow the gamer paint marks.

4730
05:01:54,870 --> 05:01:57,310
Gamer paint marks are made for me baby!

4731
05:02:02,990 --> 05:02:04,110
Let's see here.

4732
05:02:04,430 --> 05:02:06,750
A key to the locked building where a man is calling for help.

4733
05:02:10,420 --> 05:02:11,740
I'm gonna do it!

4734
05:02:23,980 --> 05:02:24,840
You're welcome.

4735
05:02:26,060 --> 05:02:26,820
Oh, nice.

4736
05:02:30,040 --> 05:02:30,580
And...

4737
05:02:33,340 --> 05:02:36,020
See, now that's a reward!

4738
05:02:36,720 --> 05:02:38,460
Now that's a reward!

4739
05:02:39,980 --> 05:02:40,900
Baby!

4740
05:02:42,900 --> 05:02:43,820
Nice!

4741
05:02:46,440 --> 05:02:48,840
Alright, that's not what I meant to do.

4742
05:02:51,460 --> 05:02:54,580
We are headed this way, I see it.

4743
05:02:56,180 --> 05:02:57,480
This way.

4744
05:03:11,680 --> 05:03:15,580
What is that guy squatting over there for?

4745
05:03:18,240 --> 05:03:20,220
Hello, I'm looking for a Steely.

4746
05:03:23,690 --> 05:03:24,430
Down here?

4747
05:03:25,850 --> 05:03:27,730
What happened?

4748
05:03:39,900 --> 05:03:40,860
Oops.

4749
05:03:44,400 --> 05:03:45,360
Steely?

4750
05:03:50,390 --> 05:03:51,370
Oh wait, here.

4751
05:03:52,190 --> 05:03:52,810
There we go.

4752
05:03:56,580 --> 05:03:58,320
Oh, we have to abandon you.

4753
05:03:59,640 --> 05:04:00,060
Alright.

4754
05:04:03,620 --> 05:04:04,880
Wait, did I have fall damage?

4755
05:04:05,100 --> 05:04:05,980
No, right?

4756
05:04:07,000 --> 05:04:08,500
Oh, the guy had fall damage.

4757
05:04:08,580 --> 05:04:09,140
Yeah, for sure.

4758
05:04:10,940 --> 05:04:11,960
Oh my god!

4759
05:04:12,580 --> 05:04:14,220
That's so awesome!

4760
05:04:16,560 --> 05:04:18,240
This is...Oh my god!

4761
05:04:18,240 --> 05:04:20,980
What a cool Steely!

4762
05:04:24,340 --> 05:04:26,860
This is the best one!

4763
05:04:28,120 --> 05:04:34,480
A giant sized figure walking among smaller men, perhaps symbolizing the half god status of a pharaoh.

4764
05:04:34,860 --> 05:04:36,460
Or just that there's giants.

4765
05:04:39,700 --> 05:04:40,580
Now what?

4766
05:04:41,540 --> 05:04:42,360
Bring the Steely.

4767
05:04:42,600 --> 05:04:44,240
Ok, we gotta bring the Steely's back.

4768
05:04:44,820 --> 05:04:46,360
What if I wanted to get the other Steely's?

4769
05:04:54,250 --> 05:04:55,010
Alright.

4770
05:04:56,130 --> 05:04:58,790
I'm keeping this, so...

4771
05:04:58,790 --> 05:05:00,250
Fire!

4772
05:05:01,190 --> 05:05:02,570
Wait, timber!

4773
05:05:04,910 --> 05:05:05,670
Nice.

4774
05:05:11,490 --> 05:05:12,250
Four!

4775
05:05:15,870 --> 05:05:17,730
So dramatic, Indy.

4776
05:05:19,170 --> 05:05:20,590
Where did my weapon go?

4777
05:05:20,830 --> 05:05:21,350
Oh, there it is.

4778
05:05:22,870 --> 05:05:27,230
My trusty...trusty steed.

4779
05:05:30,910 --> 05:05:31,750
Hello!

4780
05:05:52,090 --> 05:05:54,890
Take your...

4781
05:05:54,890 --> 05:05:55,130
Cookies.

4782
05:05:55,510 --> 05:05:57,370
Move your feet please!

4783
05:05:58,350 --> 05:05:59,010
No!

4784
05:05:59,370 --> 05:05:59,810
No!

4785
05:05:59,910 --> 05:06:00,630
I want your cookies!

4786
05:06:01,190 --> 05:06:02,290
Give me your cookies!

4787
05:06:03,230 --> 05:06:03,470
No!

4788
05:06:03,590 --> 05:06:04,290
Oh my god.

4789
05:06:08,810 --> 05:06:10,470
Nobody heard anything, right?

4790
05:06:15,390 --> 05:06:16,050
Anyway...

4791
05:06:19,410 --> 05:06:20,550
You're a heavy guy.

4792
05:06:20,970 --> 05:06:21,430
Hold on.

4793
05:06:21,830 --> 05:06:24,630
Give me a bit of a...

4794
05:06:24,630 --> 05:06:25,850
Ok, there we go.

4795
05:06:25,970 --> 05:06:26,290
Nice.

4796
05:06:31,520 --> 05:06:32,000
And...drop.

4797
05:06:36,060 --> 05:06:36,820
Oh wait.

4798
05:06:42,250 --> 05:06:43,150
How do I drop?

4799
05:06:43,650 --> 05:06:44,590
Maybe backwards.

4800
05:06:46,370 --> 05:06:47,090
And drop.

4801
05:06:53,770 --> 05:06:54,250
Raiders?

4802
05:06:54,470 --> 05:06:56,350
Wait, I'm not getting any raid notifications.

4803
05:06:56,550 --> 05:06:56,770
Hello!

4804
05:06:56,950 --> 05:06:57,850
Thank you guys!

4805
05:06:59,590 --> 05:07:01,590
Sorry, I'm not getting any notifications.

4806
05:07:02,910 --> 05:07:06,050
Ok, now I can finally take his cookies.

4807
05:07:06,190 --> 05:07:06,430
Welcome!

4808
05:07:08,650 --> 05:07:11,910
I had a dream you were in a video game in a section called Mince Hints.

4809
05:07:12,330 --> 05:07:17,110
But all your hints were unsettling, like saying how the player could breathe after being buried alive.

4810
05:07:17,170 --> 05:07:19,910
Oh, how long a player could breathe after being buried alive.

4811
05:07:20,550 --> 05:07:22,250
Sounds like some useful hints, huh?

4812
05:07:24,310 --> 05:07:26,590
I wouldn't want to know how long I could breathe...

4813
05:07:27,370 --> 05:07:28,650
...after being buried alive.

4814
05:07:28,650 --> 05:07:30,350
Ducky, thanks for the gift!

4815
05:07:31,930 --> 05:07:33,370
I just killed a man!

4816
05:07:34,430 --> 05:07:36,490
Oh, and I killed my...

4817
05:07:36,490 --> 05:07:38,410
I killed my club!

4818
05:07:40,050 --> 05:07:40,490
Alright.

4819
05:07:40,910 --> 05:07:42,110
Oh, you gotta go this way anyway.

4820
05:07:42,430 --> 05:07:44,270
You think I can climb up this hill?

4821
05:07:45,870 --> 05:07:47,110
Only one way to try.

4822
05:07:49,590 --> 05:07:51,130
Half the fun is not knowing.

4823
05:07:51,530 --> 05:07:51,970
True.

4824
05:07:53,350 --> 05:07:54,170
What's down there?

4825
05:07:54,230 --> 05:07:54,870
I don't know.

4826
05:07:55,050 --> 05:07:57,010
I'm kind of scared to look.

4827
05:07:57,010 --> 05:07:58,370
I'm gonna go around.

4828
05:08:01,190 --> 05:08:03,250
Also, I couldn't get it open.

4829
05:08:04,330 --> 05:08:04,810
Carzy!

4830
05:08:05,370 --> 05:08:06,450
Thank you so much for the gifted!

4831
05:08:07,090 --> 05:08:08,050
Think I should turn back?

4832
05:08:08,150 --> 05:08:08,250
Oh.

4833
05:08:08,530 --> 05:08:08,690
Oh.

4834
05:08:08,930 --> 05:08:09,090
Oh.

4835
05:08:09,250 --> 05:08:09,470
Okay.

4836
05:08:09,770 --> 05:08:09,990
Oh.

4837
05:08:10,510 --> 05:08:10,990
Okay.

4838
05:08:11,390 --> 05:08:11,850
I got it.

4839
05:08:12,190 --> 05:08:12,450
Alright.

4840
05:08:12,630 --> 05:08:13,250
You're fine, Indy.

4841
05:08:13,290 --> 05:08:13,730
Don't worry.

4842
05:08:14,510 --> 05:08:15,030
Don't worry.

4843
05:08:15,810 --> 05:08:17,770
It's an interesting way to do invisible walls.

4844
05:08:27,690 --> 05:08:29,310
Gosh, what a nice stroll.

4845
05:08:29,990 --> 05:08:30,670
What's in here?

4846
05:08:33,030 --> 05:08:34,730
Sphinx Temple Ruins.

4847
05:08:38,650 --> 05:08:39,510
Someone's talking.

4848
05:08:40,310 --> 05:08:42,150
And I'm also gonna steal their persimmons.

4849
05:08:43,110 --> 05:08:43,710
Nice.

4850
05:08:47,310 --> 05:08:49,510
I'm the persimmon stealer.

4851
05:08:49,670 --> 05:08:50,190
Oh, hi!

4852
05:08:52,070 --> 05:08:55,250
Look at all these nice boxes to hide behind.

4853
05:09:00,830 --> 05:09:02,350
Maybe I shouldn't have gone in here.

4854
05:09:06,310 --> 05:09:08,190
Is this also a guy that will catch me?

4855
05:09:08,530 --> 05:09:09,790
Oh God, I'm just gonna leave in here.

4856
05:09:10,210 --> 05:09:10,770
Let's just leave.

4857
05:09:17,730 --> 05:09:18,530
Oh gosh.

4858
05:09:19,970 --> 05:09:21,190
We're going back to the village.

4859
05:09:22,450 --> 05:09:23,850
Are all these slackers still...

4860
05:09:23,850 --> 05:09:25,490
There's new guys!

4861
05:09:25,810 --> 05:09:27,270
They got rid of the slackers!

4862
05:09:27,270 --> 05:09:29,530
There's actual people there!

4863
05:09:30,010 --> 05:09:30,550
Dang.

4864
05:09:35,540 --> 05:09:37,180
We could...

4865
05:09:37,180 --> 05:09:38,720
What is it?

4866
05:09:38,840 --> 05:09:39,420
Worker's area?

4867
05:09:40,580 --> 05:09:41,580
No, not the village.

4868
05:09:41,640 --> 05:09:42,120
Where am I going?

4869
05:09:44,520 --> 05:09:45,900
The worker's area!

4870
05:09:50,740 --> 05:09:51,560
Hello.

4871
05:09:56,660 --> 05:09:58,300
Not impressive.

4872
05:10:03,610 --> 05:10:04,450
I'm gonna go.

4873
05:10:04,630 --> 05:10:05,970
I can kill these guys again.

4874
05:10:06,070 --> 05:10:06,210
What?

4875
05:10:06,250 --> 05:10:07,050
There's only two of them.

4876
05:10:08,090 --> 05:10:09,430
There's only two of you.

4877
05:10:10,090 --> 05:10:10,970
And one of me.

4878
05:10:13,970 --> 05:10:14,870
Where was he?

4879
05:10:17,730 --> 05:10:18,050
Hello.

4880
05:10:20,590 --> 05:10:21,070
Ellenbrin.

4881
05:10:22,250 --> 05:10:23,850
I can take the rest of it.

4882
05:10:25,350 --> 05:10:26,770
Anyway, let's go deliver these.

4883
05:10:29,840 --> 05:10:32,760
And as cutscene happens...

4884
05:10:32,760 --> 05:10:34,540
I eat dinner.

4885
05:10:35,200 --> 05:10:35,600
Hello.

4886
05:10:38,580 --> 05:10:40,460
I delivered them to you.

4887
05:10:41,620 --> 05:10:43,040
Bring the steelies.

4888
05:10:43,320 --> 05:10:43,960
I got them.

4889
05:10:45,180 --> 05:10:45,980
Your steelies.

4890
05:10:46,920 --> 05:10:47,980
Your steelies?

4891
05:10:49,060 --> 05:10:49,700
Oh, here.

4892
05:10:50,560 --> 05:10:51,640
Giant steely.

4893
05:10:52,660 --> 05:10:54,480
Harvest steely.

4894
05:10:56,180 --> 05:10:58,080
Protector steely.

4895
05:11:00,880 --> 05:11:02,660
Sub-ex steely.

4896
05:11:05,640 --> 05:11:06,060
You're welcome.

4897
05:11:19,180 --> 05:11:19,860
Bananas.

4898
05:11:20,140 --> 05:11:21,820
What if they want to take the bananas though?

4899
05:11:23,280 --> 05:11:23,720
Alright.

4900
05:11:24,720 --> 05:11:26,680
Don't mention it.

4901
05:11:27,560 --> 05:11:28,580
Delivery boy.

4902
05:11:29,980 --> 05:11:31,340
Over here?

4903
05:11:33,260 --> 05:11:34,140
Delivery boy.

4904
05:11:34,980 --> 05:11:36,380
Delivery boy.

4905
05:11:37,160 --> 05:11:37,980
I have...

4906
05:11:38,540 --> 05:11:40,360
Is that what those bananas are too then?

4907
05:11:43,940 --> 05:11:44,220
Okay.

4908
05:11:47,540 --> 05:11:48,460
Alright.

4909
05:11:49,460 --> 05:11:49,800
Thanks.

4910
05:11:52,900 --> 05:11:53,760
Yeah, you better.

4911
05:11:57,280 --> 05:11:58,520
Got it.

4912
05:11:58,520 --> 05:12:00,660
Work passes obtained from the museum.

4913
05:12:01,640 --> 05:12:02,300
Nice.

4914
05:12:03,840 --> 05:12:05,180
Alright, let's go deliver these.

4915
05:12:09,300 --> 05:12:10,740
I have this for you.

4916
05:12:11,980 --> 05:12:12,920
You want them here?

4917
05:12:13,680 --> 05:12:15,620
She is very specific.

4918
05:12:33,980 --> 05:12:35,280
Alright, Dame Duval.

4919
05:12:36,000 --> 05:12:37,100
What have you got?

4920
05:12:37,540 --> 05:12:40,040
Have you heard of the tunnels underneath Giza?

4921
05:12:41,280 --> 05:12:43,840
There have been some findings, but...

4922
05:12:43,840 --> 05:12:44,640
mostly hypothetical.

4923
05:12:45,200 --> 05:12:46,040
Until now.

4924
05:12:49,200 --> 05:12:50,460
Are these the tunnels?

4925
05:12:51,400 --> 05:12:53,020
Some of them, yes.

4926
05:12:53,680 --> 05:12:59,980
Now these are unconfirmed from a highly speculative paper regarding the existence of a burial chamber.

4927
05:13:00,360 --> 05:13:04,820
Much like the Osirian Miss Murray and Sir Petrie found in 1903.

4928
05:13:05,920 --> 05:13:15,840
But, I believe that one of my agents has found an entrance right here that leads straight into the Nazi compound.

4929
05:13:16,380 --> 05:13:19,840
Now, this is my proposal.

4930
05:13:20,540 --> 05:13:20,960
I do.

4931
05:13:25,600 --> 05:13:28,100
Once inside the dig site, act quickly.

4932
05:13:28,280 --> 05:13:32,440
Find the tunnel that leads into the camp before you are discovered.

4933
05:13:32,440 --> 05:13:33,620
Got it.

4934
05:13:35,700 --> 05:13:36,800
Got it.

4935
05:13:39,940 --> 05:13:44,320
This guy is literally that meme of people with blue eyes.

4936
05:13:51,580 --> 05:13:56,760
Ok, find the tunnel entrance.

4937
05:13:58,260 --> 05:14:00,100
Take some persimmons.

4938
05:14:03,020 --> 05:14:04,320
Marked with red paint.

4939
05:14:04,500 --> 05:14:05,900
Alright, we gotta be quick.

4940
05:14:06,960 --> 05:14:07,960
Indy, be fast.

4941
05:14:08,060 --> 05:14:08,860
Indy, be quick.

4942
05:14:09,560 --> 05:14:11,520
Indy, beat the guards up with a stick.

4943
05:14:12,920 --> 05:14:13,600
Excuse me.

4944
05:14:14,100 --> 05:14:15,840
I'm looking for...

4945
05:14:16,360 --> 05:14:19,540
wares and things to steal and eat.

4946
05:14:22,360 --> 05:14:24,880
How's my... actually...

4947
05:14:24,880 --> 05:14:26,500
You know what, my...

4948
05:14:26,500 --> 05:14:28,060
My stamina?

4949
05:14:28,540 --> 05:14:29,340
We could use some more.

4950
05:14:31,120 --> 05:14:32,980
I can take these last two.

4951
05:14:33,140 --> 05:14:34,040
I appreciate it.

4952
05:14:34,160 --> 05:14:35,380
I'm very greedy, thank you.

4953
05:14:35,540 --> 05:14:36,060
Anyways.

4954
05:14:37,940 --> 05:14:38,520
Yep.

4955
05:14:39,260 --> 05:14:40,120
Alright, red.

4956
05:14:40,540 --> 05:14:41,740
Red, red, red paint.

4957
05:14:43,980 --> 05:14:44,500
No?

4958
05:14:49,230 --> 05:14:50,350
Any red paint?

4959
05:14:51,350 --> 05:14:53,170
Any red paint over here?

4960
05:14:54,650 --> 05:14:55,010
Hello?

4961
05:14:56,390 --> 05:14:56,710
Oh!

4962
05:14:59,150 --> 05:15:00,410
I think I found it.

4963
05:15:06,180 --> 05:15:08,880
And they even left us a Minecraft.

4964
05:15:11,960 --> 05:15:12,480
What?

4965
05:15:28,240 --> 05:15:31,820
Oh my God!

4966
05:15:31,820 --> 05:15:33,820
You're not afraid of tight spaces, are you?

4967
05:15:41,260 --> 05:15:42,460
That's so good.

4968
05:15:42,580 --> 05:15:43,800
Oh, ok everybody.

4969
05:15:45,140 --> 05:15:45,660
Let's...

4970
05:15:46,160 --> 05:15:48,500
Let's all, you know, use all the strength.

4971
05:15:49,040 --> 05:15:49,460
Everything.

4972
05:15:57,080 --> 05:15:57,960
That's a mummy!

4973
05:15:58,440 --> 05:15:59,100
That's a mummy!

4974
05:15:59,820 --> 05:16:01,280
Oh my God, that's a mummy!

4975
05:16:04,340 --> 05:16:05,560
Oh, dang.

4976
05:16:09,220 --> 05:16:09,860
Mummy!

4977
05:16:12,800 --> 05:16:13,440
Mummy.

4978
05:16:13,620 --> 05:16:14,300
Sorry, mummy.

4979
05:16:15,060 --> 05:16:15,880
Sorry, mummy.

4980
05:16:16,900 --> 05:16:17,540
Yikes.

4981
05:16:17,740 --> 05:16:18,280
Ok, hold on.

4982
05:16:19,060 --> 05:16:20,320
Oh, a headless mummy!

4983
05:16:23,840 --> 05:16:24,480
Wow!

4984
05:16:25,360 --> 05:16:27,440
Do we not care about these mummies?

4985
05:16:28,220 --> 05:16:31,840
Are these not huge archeological feats?

4986
05:16:32,040 --> 05:16:32,900
Like, what is this?

4987
05:16:32,900 --> 05:16:34,300
Oh, ok.

4988
05:16:47,600 --> 05:16:48,240
Hey!

4989
05:16:54,680 --> 05:16:56,180
Why does she sound like that?

4990
05:16:58,040 --> 05:16:58,780
Ma'am?

4991
05:17:04,010 --> 05:17:06,330
Why is it so spooky in here?

4992
05:17:09,570 --> 05:17:11,750
I thought these were steelies for a second.

4993
05:17:11,850 --> 05:17:13,710
These look like we need to put stuff on top of them.

4994
05:17:17,970 --> 05:17:18,710
And this?

4995
05:17:20,190 --> 05:17:21,130
Oh, my eyes.

4996
05:17:28,770 --> 05:17:31,270
Normal mummy, not cat mummy, so no care.

4997
05:17:31,990 --> 05:17:32,810
I guess that's fair.

4998
05:17:32,970 --> 05:17:36,430
Oh, our cat mummy was not even a cat mummy at all.

4999
05:17:38,870 --> 05:17:39,790
Oh, my God.

5000
05:17:45,050 --> 05:17:46,010
Jeez Louise!

5001
05:17:47,190 --> 05:17:48,730
Oh, that's going to be us.

5002
05:17:50,370 --> 05:17:51,770
Yeah, a dead body.

5003
05:17:58,160 --> 05:17:58,640
Um,

5004
05:18:06,900 --> 05:18:07,960
what do you mean by that?

5005
05:18:08,020 --> 05:18:09,400
Something is moving on the floor.

5006
05:18:12,220 --> 05:18:13,520
What do you mean by that?

5007
05:18:13,520 --> 05:18:15,000
I'm going to throw this?

5008
05:18:17,080 --> 05:18:18,800
Oh, it's these guys!

5009
05:18:21,860 --> 05:18:23,840
Ok, not very far apparently.

5010
05:18:30,820 --> 05:18:32,580
Where did all these guys come from?

5011
05:18:34,780 --> 05:18:36,200
Chill, chill, chill.

5012
05:18:37,820 --> 05:18:38,960
Chill, chill, chill.

5013
05:18:39,940 --> 05:18:41,000
Chill, chill, chill.

5014
05:18:41,100 --> 05:18:41,300
Ok.

5015
05:18:41,300 --> 05:18:42,860
And then I think I...Oh, my God.

5016
05:18:43,380 --> 05:18:45,300
If I drop it now...

5017
05:18:46,800 --> 05:18:48,040
Will they stay away?

5018
05:18:48,600 --> 05:18:49,260
Ok, they do.

5019
05:18:49,520 --> 05:18:50,100
Ok, nice.

5020
05:18:50,320 --> 05:18:51,200
And throw!

5021
05:18:53,880 --> 05:18:55,200
And take you!

5022
05:18:58,100 --> 05:18:58,640
And...

5023
05:18:58,640 --> 05:18:59,500
I'm trying!

5024
05:19:00,180 --> 05:19:02,240
You think I'm just like playing around here?

5025
05:19:02,860 --> 05:19:03,460
Ma'am!

5026
05:19:07,340 --> 05:19:09,640
Don't, don't, don't, don't play with me.

5027
05:19:11,920 --> 05:19:12,480
Drop!

5028
05:19:13,020 --> 05:19:13,480
And...

5029
05:19:13,480 --> 05:19:14,200
Run.

5030
05:19:16,020 --> 05:19:16,300
Ok.

5031
05:19:19,850 --> 05:19:22,130
So I can kind of create like a little pathway.

5032
05:19:22,410 --> 05:19:23,930
Well, actually...

5033
05:19:24,910 --> 05:19:26,110
Yeah, I'm trying.

5034
05:19:27,190 --> 05:19:28,050
I'm scared.

5035
05:19:29,850 --> 05:19:32,670
They don't seem to like have...

5036
05:19:33,790 --> 05:19:38,210
They don't seem to be so afraid of the torches when they are on the ground.

5037
05:19:45,030 --> 05:19:46,070
Oh...

5038
05:19:46,670 --> 05:19:49,470
Go away, go away.

5039
05:19:49,990 --> 05:19:50,310
Alright.

5040
05:19:52,430 --> 05:19:52,950
Throw!

5041
05:19:58,020 --> 05:20:00,880
At least they go away for like a little bit.

5042
05:20:04,160 --> 05:20:05,200
And...

5043
05:20:05,200 --> 05:20:05,540
Throw!

5044
05:20:08,240 --> 05:20:09,280
Ok.

5045
05:20:09,280 --> 05:20:09,380
Ok.

5046
05:20:13,640 --> 05:20:16,080
Ok, I'm gonna drop it.

5047
05:20:16,500 --> 05:20:17,060
Run!

5048
05:20:19,200 --> 05:20:19,900
I'm trying!

5049
05:20:21,940 --> 05:20:22,940
Oh my god.

5050
05:20:27,660 --> 05:20:28,800
Yeah, go, go!

5051
05:20:29,380 --> 05:20:29,920
Get, get!

5052
05:20:32,950 --> 05:20:33,370
Be gone!

5053
05:20:33,710 --> 05:20:34,830
Oh, I'm running out of stamina.

5054
05:20:36,390 --> 05:20:37,230
Be gone!

5055
05:20:38,470 --> 05:20:39,050
Be gone!

5056
05:20:39,050 --> 05:20:42,110
I think if I put it here...

5057
05:20:42,110 --> 05:20:43,050
I might be ok.

5058
05:20:48,350 --> 05:20:50,290
Ok, there you go.

5059
05:20:55,790 --> 05:20:56,610
Now what?

5060
05:20:59,610 --> 05:21:00,210
Nice.

5061
05:21:05,470 --> 05:21:06,870
Where, where are we going?

5062
05:21:06,870 --> 05:21:06,890
Good.

5063
05:21:09,970 --> 05:21:11,430
I guess this opened up too.

5064
05:21:11,650 --> 05:21:12,810
Oh, this is where we are going.

5065
05:21:14,490 --> 05:21:15,110
Good job.

5066
05:21:16,490 --> 05:21:17,610
Ok, we can go there.

5067
05:21:18,390 --> 05:21:19,250
And that's it.

5068
05:21:21,270 --> 05:21:22,930
We can't go anywhere else.

5069
05:21:23,830 --> 05:21:24,950
Now, we know that there...

5070
05:21:24,950 --> 05:21:26,870
How do we know that this leads to outdoors?

5071
05:21:27,790 --> 05:21:27,930
Oh.

5072
05:21:41,760 --> 05:21:42,580
Alright, Gina.

5073
05:21:43,280 --> 05:21:45,020
Take down the flag.

5074
05:21:50,220 --> 05:21:52,540
That, oh, all the way over there?

5075
05:21:54,960 --> 05:21:56,300
Oh no, ok, right there.

5076
05:21:57,740 --> 05:21:59,780
Alright, let's go, let's get it down.

5077
05:22:00,840 --> 05:22:01,140
Yeah.

5078
05:22:01,140 --> 05:22:05,360
And if we find any guys, just...

5079
05:22:05,940 --> 05:22:07,220
Just beat them up.

5080
05:22:07,960 --> 05:22:08,520
Wait, where?

5081
05:22:10,300 --> 05:22:11,480
Right there, ok.

5082
05:22:12,300 --> 05:22:13,400
How do we get over there?

5083
05:22:19,520 --> 05:22:22,040
Oh my god, there's like, I hear voices everywhere.

5084
05:22:22,100 --> 05:22:23,220
Oh my gosh, there's...

5085
05:22:23,220 --> 05:22:24,860
Oh, this place is every...

5086
05:22:24,860 --> 05:22:25,660
Oh, no!

5087
05:22:28,900 --> 05:22:30,080
Where are you going, Gina?

5088
05:22:30,080 --> 05:22:30,520
Oh.

5089
05:22:31,720 --> 05:22:32,960
Nobody notices us, right?

5090
05:22:34,120 --> 05:22:35,040
Oh, someone did.

5091
05:22:35,340 --> 05:22:35,840
Kind of.

5092
05:22:35,980 --> 05:22:36,240
Maybe.

5093
05:22:37,120 --> 05:22:37,700
Might be fine.

5094
05:22:38,700 --> 05:22:39,920
I'm gonna eat some fruit.

5095
05:22:40,680 --> 05:22:42,180
So I can replenish my...

5096
05:22:42,920 --> 05:22:43,420
Stamina.

5097
05:22:44,580 --> 05:22:45,260
A prickly pear.

5098
05:22:50,340 --> 05:22:50,840
Ok.

5099
05:22:54,120 --> 05:22:54,960
Oh, perfect.

5100
05:22:55,240 --> 05:22:56,200
That's what I was looking for.

5101
05:22:56,380 --> 05:22:56,880
Alright, good.

5102
05:23:01,940 --> 05:23:02,880
Someone notice me?

5103
05:23:03,360 --> 05:23:03,680
Nah.

5104
05:23:08,220 --> 05:23:09,280
Gina, take this.

5105
05:23:11,020 --> 05:23:12,380
Gina, take...

5106
05:23:12,380 --> 05:23:13,720
The other...

5107
05:23:14,220 --> 05:23:15,420
Take the other one.

5108
05:23:16,320 --> 05:23:17,540
Take the other one.

5109
05:23:17,680 --> 05:23:18,580
Take the other...

5110
05:23:18,580 --> 05:23:19,600
Take the other shovel.

5111
05:23:20,240 --> 05:23:20,460
No?

5112
05:23:20,620 --> 05:23:20,760
Ok.

5113
05:23:21,600 --> 05:23:24,440
Hi Melvin, thank you for a month.

5114
05:23:24,520 --> 05:23:25,360
Thank you.

5115
05:23:36,460 --> 05:23:37,720
I got him.

5116
05:23:39,000 --> 05:23:39,500
Anyway.

5117
05:23:40,980 --> 05:23:42,900
They're probably fine.

5118
05:23:43,740 --> 05:23:44,300
But down.

5119
05:23:45,320 --> 05:23:45,940
For a while.

5120
05:23:46,780 --> 05:23:47,720
Maybe a long while.

5121
05:23:48,180 --> 05:23:48,620
Who knows.

5122
05:23:49,540 --> 05:23:50,060
Anyway.

5123
05:23:50,960 --> 05:23:51,840
Alright, onwards.

5124
05:23:51,840 --> 05:23:53,380
Up there.

5125
05:23:53,660 --> 05:23:54,880
We gotta take the flag.

5126
05:23:55,400 --> 05:23:58,940
Oh my gosh, I love a good game of capture the flag, baby.

5127
05:24:02,580 --> 05:24:03,460
Oh, hello.

5128
05:24:08,380 --> 05:24:09,540
Oh, is he the medic?

5129
05:24:10,900 --> 05:24:11,740
Can I take your bandages?

5130
05:24:15,380 --> 05:24:15,820
Bandage.

5131
05:24:17,240 --> 05:24:17,680
Yeah.

5132
05:24:19,420 --> 05:24:20,540
What are you doing, Gina?

5133
05:24:24,520 --> 05:24:25,400
Oh shit.

5134
05:24:27,780 --> 05:24:30,140
Guys, this might be...

5135
05:24:30,140 --> 05:24:31,520
We might be in trouble.

5136
05:24:33,540 --> 05:24:34,880
Nah, he's gonna turn around.

5137
05:24:37,820 --> 05:24:38,980
He's gonna turn around.

5138
05:24:41,720 --> 05:24:42,920
He's gonna turn around.

5139
05:24:43,540 --> 05:24:44,220
Yeah, see?

5140
05:24:45,120 --> 05:24:45,660
Is she ok?

5141
05:24:46,560 --> 05:24:49,060
Oh my god, Gina, you scared me so bad.

5142
05:24:52,180 --> 05:24:53,460
What do I do here?

5143
05:24:53,620 --> 05:24:53,840
Army!

5144
05:24:59,460 --> 05:25:00,940
What just happened?

5145
05:25:01,780 --> 05:25:02,640
What's happening?

5146
05:25:07,460 --> 05:25:08,080
Ok.

5147
05:25:18,410 --> 05:25:19,710
I don't know yet.

5148
05:25:20,790 --> 05:25:21,530
Yeah, exactly.

5149
05:25:25,590 --> 05:25:27,990
Everybody should be running towards that direction.

5150
05:25:33,290 --> 05:25:35,430
There should be no one around.

5151
05:25:35,710 --> 05:25:36,150
What's this?

5152
05:25:36,370 --> 05:25:37,570
Oh, those are...

5153
05:25:37,570 --> 05:25:38,090
Dynamite?

5154
05:25:38,410 --> 05:25:38,770
Hello?

5155
05:25:40,370 --> 05:25:41,790
I kinda want it though.

5156
05:25:51,710 --> 05:25:54,590
Why are you acting so casual?

5157
05:25:55,370 --> 05:25:57,810
Something just blew up in your...

5158
05:25:57,810 --> 05:25:59,370
In your place!

5159
05:26:05,330 --> 05:26:13,090
Oh, he said...

5160
05:26:18,340 --> 05:26:18,820
Shotgun!

5161
05:26:20,420 --> 05:26:21,240
Someone save me?

5162
05:26:21,500 --> 05:26:22,900
Every time I hear that...

5163
05:26:23,520 --> 05:26:24,660
I'm like, did someone save me?

5164
05:26:24,940 --> 05:26:25,820
Oh, yes they did.

5165
05:26:29,980 --> 05:26:30,460
Goodbye.

5166
05:26:30,460 --> 05:26:30,780
Goodbye.

5167
05:26:31,640 --> 05:26:32,080
Thanks.

5168
05:26:41,520 --> 05:26:43,180
I will have to kill you though.

5169
05:26:46,560 --> 05:26:47,500
Well, not kill.

5170
05:26:47,700 --> 05:26:47,900
You know.

5171
05:26:49,860 --> 05:26:51,480
I will have to...

5172
05:26:52,240 --> 05:26:52,860
You know.

5173
05:26:54,400 --> 05:26:55,540
Can I take any more cookie?

5174
05:26:56,140 --> 05:26:57,060
Give me your cookies.

5175
05:26:57,840 --> 05:26:59,040
Oh, item limit reached?

5176
05:26:59,100 --> 05:26:59,320
Really?

5177
05:27:07,220 --> 05:27:09,060
Oh shit, this guy knows how to fight.

5178
05:27:11,900 --> 05:27:12,500
It's ok.

5179
05:27:12,620 --> 05:27:13,160
So do I.

5180
05:27:14,120 --> 05:27:14,480
Oh!

5181
05:27:14,700 --> 05:27:15,540
There is a guy right there?

5182
05:27:15,960 --> 05:27:16,400
Oh my god.

5183
05:27:27,250 --> 05:27:28,450
Gino, where are you going?

5184
05:27:29,670 --> 05:27:31,050
I can't stand her.

5185
05:27:33,130 --> 05:27:35,090
I'm gonna use a bandage real quick.

5186
05:27:35,510 --> 05:27:36,630
I'm scared of...

5187
05:27:37,110 --> 05:27:38,150
I'm scared of death.

5188
05:27:41,830 --> 05:27:42,950
I've got hands.

5189
05:27:42,950 --> 05:27:44,890
That's not an important item?

5190
05:27:46,270 --> 05:27:46,570
Ok.

5191
05:27:57,690 --> 05:27:59,430
I tried using it for security.

5192
05:27:59,530 --> 05:28:01,050
I don't want them to hear me.

5193
05:28:02,570 --> 05:28:03,110
God.

5194
05:28:04,230 --> 05:28:06,950
I could hide their bodies, but you know...

5195
05:28:06,950 --> 05:28:07,230
Oh!

5196
05:28:12,970 --> 05:28:17,250
They just don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming!

5197
05:28:18,770 --> 05:28:20,630
Oh my god Gino, you scared me.

5198
05:28:27,320 --> 05:28:28,560
Get out of the way!

5199
05:28:31,760 --> 05:28:33,860
They don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming!

5200
05:28:33,860 --> 05:28:38,860
I guess we can just... It says go up over this way, but I feel like we're...

5201
05:28:39,500 --> 05:28:42,260
You know, we'll just go up over this way.

5202
05:28:46,960 --> 05:28:47,400
Bandage.

5203
05:28:48,720 --> 05:28:51,560
Uh oh, we're getting spotted by something, someone, somewhere.

5204
05:28:52,060 --> 05:28:52,240
Where?

5205
05:28:54,140 --> 05:28:54,580
Whomst?

5206
05:28:59,870 --> 05:29:01,670
I think I was in the correct spot.

5207
05:29:03,090 --> 05:29:03,850
Oh, show yourself?

5208
05:29:05,650 --> 05:29:06,290
I'm here?

5209
05:29:17,810 --> 05:29:18,970
Who's seeing me?

5210
05:29:19,410 --> 05:29:19,850
Whomst.

5211
05:29:22,550 --> 05:29:23,790
Oh, that guy over there.

5212
05:29:24,510 --> 05:29:29,170
Wow, these guys have such... Oh, I was gonna say he has such eagle eyes, but...

5213
05:29:29,170 --> 05:29:30,810
He actually just...

5214
05:29:43,280 --> 05:29:45,320
I wanna say it's a rat?

5215
05:29:45,620 --> 05:29:46,480
Oh my god.

5216
05:29:46,820 --> 05:29:47,600
He took him out.

5217
05:29:47,720 --> 05:29:49,820
The NPCs in this game are so stupid.

5218
05:29:49,820 --> 05:29:51,820
They wish they could be Metal Gear.

5219
05:29:52,540 --> 05:29:53,820
What the hell?

5220
05:29:57,900 --> 05:29:59,100
No way.

5221
05:30:00,580 --> 05:30:04,380
I can do anything and they'll be like... Literally just the wind.

5222
05:30:11,050 --> 05:30:12,370
I love this game.

5223
05:30:13,070 --> 05:30:14,670
This is if I were good at Metal Gear.

5224
05:30:16,210 --> 05:30:18,570
Stealth is just, you know...

5225
05:30:19,190 --> 05:30:19,790
Whatever.

5226
05:30:23,170 --> 05:30:23,690
Who?

5227
05:30:23,690 --> 05:30:24,590
Who's mad at me?

5228
05:30:27,530 --> 05:30:28,310
I don't know.

5229
05:30:28,670 --> 05:30:29,050
Whatever.

5230
05:30:31,190 --> 05:30:35,570
But if I use that... If I use this...

5231
05:30:37,650 --> 05:30:39,650
I think there's people in here, right?

5232
05:30:40,710 --> 05:30:41,130
Oh yeah.

5233
05:30:41,130 --> 05:30:44,320
What the fuck?

5234
05:30:47,540 --> 05:30:48,260
Hi.

5235
05:30:50,220 --> 05:30:51,000
Oh wow.

5236
05:30:51,540 --> 05:30:52,300
Didn't even notice.

5237
05:30:53,040 --> 05:30:53,640
That's so great.

5238
05:30:56,320 --> 05:30:57,960
Gina, he's gonna see you.

5239
05:31:01,780 --> 05:31:03,760
Gina, he's gonna... Oh shit.

5240
05:31:08,400 --> 05:31:11,760
Oh, I'm trying.

5241
05:31:14,540 --> 05:31:15,880
Yeah, double team him.

5242
05:31:16,760 --> 05:31:17,680
And take their money.

5243
05:31:19,340 --> 05:31:20,500
Good job everybody.

5244
05:31:20,620 --> 05:31:21,280
Good job team.

5245
05:31:25,300 --> 05:31:26,440
Eat the melon bread.

5246
05:31:27,460 --> 05:31:28,480
Take the melon bread.

5247
05:31:28,880 --> 05:31:30,440
Oh my god, what did I get now?

5248
05:31:30,660 --> 05:31:32,300
Bread is life.

5249
05:31:37,960 --> 05:31:38,940
This is so silly.

5250
05:31:39,320 --> 05:31:40,840
I did say this earlier.

5251
05:31:41,360 --> 05:31:44,620
I was just wanting to look around a little bit before...

5252
05:31:45,340 --> 05:31:46,360
Before we grabbed it.

5253
05:31:46,360 --> 05:31:49,740
Thank you for writing to me regarding your desire for an interview.

5254
05:31:50,000 --> 05:31:52,940
Well, your ideas certainly sound interesting for lack of a better word.

5255
05:31:53,240 --> 05:31:55,580
Do you really consider yourself the world's greatest archaeologist?

5256
05:31:55,700 --> 05:32:01,000
I am an extremely busy journalist and have no time for writing puff pieces for anyone.

5257
05:32:01,260 --> 05:32:03,220
Not even Indiana Jones himself.

5258
05:32:04,980 --> 05:32:07,940
Speaking of which, why do you insist on calling Dr. Jones a fraud?

5259
05:32:08,700 --> 05:32:11,440
I can name a multitude of his most important finds.

5260
05:32:11,720 --> 05:32:13,560
Even can barely count yours on one hand.

5261
05:32:13,560 --> 05:32:17,840
Even if two of my fingers had been severed.

5262
05:32:18,000 --> 05:32:18,900
Okay Gina, please.

5263
05:32:19,380 --> 05:32:23,000
Anyway, thank you for your proposal, but I must respectfully decline.

5264
05:32:25,260 --> 05:32:25,520
Damn.

5265
05:32:29,720 --> 05:32:30,260
Volcano?

5266
05:32:31,700 --> 05:32:35,720
I don't... I don't recall who that's supposed to reference.

5267
05:32:40,650 --> 05:32:42,750
Damn, that's such a good insult.

5268
05:32:43,350 --> 05:32:46,930
I would be able to count on one hand, even if two fingers were severed.

5269
05:32:47,570 --> 05:32:48,090
Like, damn!

5270
05:32:49,170 --> 05:32:50,530
Wait, there's still a guy there?

5271
05:33:00,090 --> 05:33:03,570
I think more than the Dreamlands, Indiana Jones.

5272
05:33:13,410 --> 05:33:14,950
This is where we're supposed to be, right?

5273
05:33:15,490 --> 05:33:16,690
Find Vos' office.

5274
05:33:16,970 --> 05:33:17,570
I'm guessing it's down here.

5275
05:33:18,850 --> 05:33:20,530
Alright, I knew it.

5276
05:33:23,150 --> 05:33:24,650
How does he get to it?

5277
05:33:30,250 --> 05:33:32,230
I like your hat and whip, Mito.

5278
05:33:32,430 --> 05:33:32,830
Thank you!

5279
05:33:37,050 --> 05:33:38,010
Let's... okay.

5280
05:33:42,870 --> 05:33:43,350
Okay.

5281
05:33:45,510 --> 05:33:46,150
What's this?

5282
05:33:51,430 --> 05:33:51,990
Ooh.

5283
05:34:01,310 --> 05:34:05,290
Battleship Clements disappeared off the coast of Peru.

5284
05:34:06,290 --> 05:34:07,210
Missing all crew members.

5285
05:34:07,490 --> 05:34:09,570
Last communication from ship received May 2nd.

5286
05:34:10,630 --> 05:34:11,850
0012, Berlin time.

5287
05:34:12,550 --> 05:34:13,830
The sun is so bright!

5288
05:34:13,830 --> 05:34:17,750
Has the Titanic happened yet?

5289
05:34:18,250 --> 05:34:19,830
Yeah, wait, Titanic was...

5290
05:34:25,340 --> 05:34:26,640
Yeah, 1912.

5291
05:34:26,760 --> 05:34:32,900
Okay, I was thinking that, but I couldn't quite remember if it was right.

5292
05:34:34,460 --> 05:34:36,660
I knew it was before World War II.

5293
05:34:39,180 --> 05:34:42,820
Details surrounding disappearance withheld from this telegram.

5294
05:34:43,060 --> 05:34:48,040
Ship part of classified expeditionary operation.

5295
05:34:50,180 --> 05:34:51,620
Wow, I can't believe I remember that though.

5296
05:34:52,140 --> 05:34:53,700
I can't believe I remember that!

5297
05:34:55,020 --> 05:34:55,620
1912.

5298
05:34:57,120 --> 05:34:57,680
What's this?

5299
05:34:57,800 --> 05:34:58,120
Letter.

5300
05:35:00,080 --> 05:35:00,920
Affirmation letter.

5301
05:35:01,100 --> 05:35:01,540
Oh god.

5302
05:35:05,160 --> 05:35:05,600
Dear...

5303
05:35:08,240 --> 05:35:10,380
I read your report about the events in Peru.

5304
05:35:11,000 --> 05:35:11,820
Is it true?

5305
05:35:13,260 --> 05:35:13,880
It is true.

5306
05:35:13,940 --> 05:35:19,160
We have lost a very valuable battleship, but the results of the experiment instills hope that it is worth even more.

5307
05:35:20,220 --> 05:35:21,560
These are degenerate times.

5308
05:35:28,920 --> 05:35:29,800
Degenerate times.

5309
05:35:33,760 --> 05:35:34,800
It's pronounced...

5310
05:35:36,040 --> 05:35:36,560
Forehead.

5311
05:35:39,660 --> 05:35:42,240
And it is our duty to drag the world into an age of purity.

5312
05:35:42,680 --> 05:35:43,700
Do not weaken, Vos.

5313
05:35:43,900 --> 05:35:49,160
If Operation Great Circle is the triumph you have promised, our final success is assured.

5314
05:35:49,860 --> 05:35:52,060
I look forward to your next report.

5315
05:35:54,400 --> 05:35:55,640
It's that guy!

5316
05:36:01,540 --> 05:36:03,320
The interpretation of dreams.

5317
05:36:03,380 --> 05:36:03,960
Oh my gosh!

5318
05:36:04,720 --> 05:36:05,460
It's Sigmund Freud.

5319
05:36:06,760 --> 05:36:11,800
Sigmund Freud's book about his theory of unconsciousness and how it's represented in dreams.

5320
05:36:12,560 --> 05:36:16,340
First published in 1899, it was later banned in Germany when Hitler rose to power.

5321
05:36:18,540 --> 05:36:21,220
Minto, you gotta memorize how to say degenerate times in German.

5322
05:36:21,720 --> 05:36:23,440
Say it to Kiwawa next.

5323
05:36:25,280 --> 05:36:26,740
She'd be like, where did you learn that?

5324
05:36:28,040 --> 05:36:28,560
Um...

5325
05:36:29,680 --> 05:36:32,800
I don't think I could tell her where I learned it from.

5326
05:36:34,900 --> 05:36:36,960
I don't think I could tell her.

5327
05:36:39,140 --> 05:36:40,920
She'd be like, who did you learn that from?

5328
05:36:43,740 --> 05:36:44,880
This guy is poor.

5329
05:36:45,200 --> 05:36:46,380
He's got a little sketch.

5330
05:36:48,560 --> 05:36:49,460
Symbols rubbing!

5331
05:36:57,280 --> 05:37:00,380
Sorry, I'm trying to look for all the stuff before we get the cutscene.

5332
05:37:01,800 --> 05:37:02,560
Genesis chapter.

5333
05:37:03,600 --> 05:37:04,940
Oh, this is a lot of text.

5334
05:37:05,300 --> 05:37:06,740
Wow, this is a lot of text.

5335
05:37:08,540 --> 05:37:09,860
The Idol of Ra.

5336
05:37:16,700 --> 05:37:17,080
Journal?

5337
05:37:17,080 --> 05:37:19,080
Oh my god, we're reading his...

5338
05:37:24,040 --> 05:37:26,820
Okay, if you're gonna talk that loud, shut the door man, please.

5339
05:37:27,780 --> 05:37:28,740
We're reading her diary?

5340
05:37:49,120 --> 05:37:49,720
Aww...

5341
05:37:49,720 --> 05:37:55,020
The symbols with the dots and the lines remind me of...

5342
05:37:55,020 --> 05:37:57,180
So there was this one...

5343
05:37:57,180 --> 05:37:59,460
Eroge I played...

5344
05:37:59,460 --> 05:38:00,380
Where...

5345
05:38:00,380 --> 05:38:03,220
It's one of those games where you like...

5346
05:38:03,980 --> 05:38:07,660
Where you uncover the picture behind it.

5347
05:38:09,220 --> 05:38:12,360
And you would connect dots in certain ways.

5348
05:38:12,600 --> 05:38:16,440
You only had a certain amount of moves and you would connect the dots in certain ways.

5349
05:38:16,440 --> 05:38:19,860
So that they would connect and then get rid of a piece of the picture.

5350
05:38:20,000 --> 05:38:21,640
So you could see underneath.

5351
05:38:27,780 --> 05:38:28,180
Money!

5352
05:38:29,060 --> 05:38:32,040
I think that's everything and then we can take the key and I think then we'll be good.

5353
05:38:35,180 --> 05:38:37,520
Everybody's doing every little tiny ant.

5354
05:38:40,000 --> 05:38:41,460
The worlds in this...

5355
05:38:41,460 --> 05:38:44,000
It's actually kind of fun that it's so open world.

5356
05:38:44,000 --> 05:38:47,000
You know, like I didn't expect this game to be...

5357
05:38:47,820 --> 05:38:50,600
Like, oh you can really just travel anywhere.

5358
05:38:50,800 --> 05:38:52,180
Like it's actually really nice.

5359
05:38:54,880 --> 05:38:56,500
I don't remember the name of it.

5360
05:38:56,700 --> 05:38:57,120
It had...

5361
05:38:58,080 --> 05:38:58,560
Nuns.

5362
05:38:58,680 --> 05:38:59,520
That's all I can remember.

5363
05:39:01,160 --> 05:39:02,440
I can't remember it.

5364
05:39:03,760 --> 05:39:05,820
If I remember it...

5365
05:39:05,820 --> 05:39:06,660
I'll tell you guys.

5366
05:39:08,500 --> 05:39:09,720
I don't gatekeep.

5367
05:39:10,400 --> 05:39:13,980
Opens the attic of the Nazi detention and interrogation center.

5368
05:39:15,220 --> 05:39:18,720
You don't think I'm gonna get demonetized from this, do you?

5369
05:39:22,240 --> 05:39:22,840
What?

5370
05:39:23,160 --> 05:39:23,620
A train?

5371
05:39:26,260 --> 05:39:26,680
Okay.

5372
05:39:28,120 --> 05:39:30,040
That's why I try to say nachos instead.

5373
05:39:32,620 --> 05:39:33,540
What's happening?

5374
05:39:36,300 --> 05:39:37,420
Boss arriving.

5375
05:39:37,540 --> 05:39:38,000
Where is he?

5376
05:39:38,000 --> 05:39:39,040
Where?

5377
05:39:40,160 --> 05:39:41,800
I'm trying to get a good picture of him.

5378
05:39:41,940 --> 05:39:42,480
Where is he?

5379
05:39:44,280 --> 05:39:45,820
Why are they all gathered around?

5380
05:39:47,780 --> 05:39:49,180
Is that him?

5381
05:39:50,560 --> 05:39:50,880
No.

5382
05:39:51,640 --> 05:39:52,600
Where are you?

5383
05:39:53,400 --> 05:39:54,500
Where is he?

5384
05:39:57,240 --> 05:39:57,840
Where?

5385
05:39:58,320 --> 05:39:59,500
Oh there he is!

5386
05:40:02,280 --> 05:40:04,080
There he is!

5387
05:40:04,400 --> 05:40:05,800
He's so small.

5388
05:40:07,240 --> 05:40:10,300
I was just taking pictures of these guys.

5389
05:40:11,840 --> 05:40:12,800
Okay, okay.

5390
05:40:13,300 --> 05:40:14,000
He's like...

5391
05:40:14,000 --> 05:40:16,360
Okay, he's like far, far away though girl.

5392
05:40:16,580 --> 05:40:18,500
We're gonna have to get all the way over there.

5393
05:40:20,060 --> 05:40:21,440
Don't look at me like that!

5394
05:40:22,160 --> 05:40:23,340
No, my weapon.

5395
05:40:23,940 --> 05:40:25,240
Oh, it only has one left.

5396
05:40:25,860 --> 05:40:27,340
I hear a guy in here complaining.

5397
05:40:35,480 --> 05:40:36,280
Oh my god.

5398
05:40:38,840 --> 05:40:39,420
Okay.

5399
05:40:40,440 --> 05:40:42,280
Let's not go down there.

5400
05:40:44,040 --> 05:40:45,360
Oh, we're down there.

5401
05:40:45,540 --> 05:40:45,960
Oh god.

5402
05:40:47,220 --> 05:40:47,800
Okay.

5403
05:40:49,400 --> 05:40:49,980
Gina.

5404
05:40:51,000 --> 05:40:52,540
Gina, we need a good plan.

5405
05:40:53,140 --> 05:40:53,400
Girl.

5406
05:40:55,240 --> 05:40:57,440
I'm just gonna take this and their money.

5407
05:40:57,780 --> 05:40:58,700
While I can.

5408
05:41:10,120 --> 05:41:13,240
Yeah, good thing I didn't stop to read that.

5409
05:41:19,480 --> 05:41:21,780
Requires a hallmarked key.

5410
05:41:24,260 --> 05:41:25,860
Interesting, where can we get that?

5411
05:41:26,020 --> 05:41:26,940
I mean there is a...

5412
05:41:27,940 --> 05:41:28,900
What is in there?

5413
05:41:29,000 --> 05:41:29,980
Oh what is that?

5414
05:41:30,120 --> 05:41:30,760
What is that?

5415
05:41:30,820 --> 05:41:31,460
It's glowing!

5416
05:41:37,020 --> 05:41:38,560
There is also here.

5417
05:41:39,320 --> 05:41:40,520
The save, nice.

5418
05:41:43,360 --> 05:41:44,540
Oh, we can leave through here.

5419
05:41:45,100 --> 05:41:45,520
Awesome.

5420
05:41:46,720 --> 05:41:48,580
I think we can leave through here.

5421
05:41:51,720 --> 05:41:52,240
Vermark.

5422
05:41:53,040 --> 05:41:53,560
Vermark.

5423
05:41:54,240 --> 05:41:54,760
Vermark.

5424
05:41:55,020 --> 05:41:55,240
Mark.

5425
05:41:57,160 --> 05:41:58,840
Can we leave through here?

5426
05:42:00,200 --> 05:42:02,760
The door is open, but we'll be far away from him.

5427
05:42:05,060 --> 05:42:06,780
Let's try going over this way.

5428
05:42:08,420 --> 05:42:09,620
Little bit more of a shortcut.

5429
05:42:12,560 --> 05:42:13,560
Probably, maybe.

5430
05:42:14,420 --> 05:42:15,260
Oh, perfect.

5431
05:42:21,590 --> 05:42:23,010
Oh, we're so good at this game.

5432
05:42:26,610 --> 05:42:28,010
Okay, that's not a person, sorry.

5433
05:42:29,930 --> 05:42:31,990
I hear a lot of people yelling.

5434
05:42:32,350 --> 05:42:35,310
Is everybody not concerned about the explosion that happened?

5435
05:42:36,030 --> 05:42:38,090
We're just gonna forget that that happened.

5436
05:42:39,830 --> 05:42:41,750
Vos is back, so we're just like, yeah, whatever.

5437
05:42:41,750 --> 05:42:43,590
I'm looking for...

5438
05:42:44,730 --> 05:42:45,890
For some sort of weapon.

5439
05:42:46,810 --> 05:42:47,790
That's a truck, Minto.

5440
05:42:48,030 --> 05:42:49,690
I know, but it looked like a person!

5441
05:42:51,690 --> 05:42:53,230
For a second, it looked like a person.

5442
05:42:58,190 --> 05:42:59,310
Gina, are you okay?

5443
05:43:01,510 --> 05:43:02,470
Gina girly.

5444
05:43:03,870 --> 05:43:04,630
Oh, here we go.

5445
05:43:04,770 --> 05:43:05,090
Perfect.

5446
05:43:05,990 --> 05:43:07,090
And some cookies.

5447
05:43:08,170 --> 05:43:09,290
That I can't take.

5448
05:43:14,030 --> 05:43:14,510
Gina!

5449
05:43:14,510 --> 05:43:15,430
Gina!

5450
05:43:17,630 --> 05:43:20,610
Okay, don't come walking up like nothing happened, okay?

5451
05:43:26,280 --> 05:43:27,540
It's over there, right?

5452
05:43:28,500 --> 05:43:28,820
Yeah.

5453
05:43:34,290 --> 05:43:38,390
Look, she's hiding.

5454
05:43:39,970 --> 05:43:41,070
Maybe she's good at this.

5455
05:43:43,030 --> 05:43:44,390
Maybe she's good at this.

5456
05:43:45,030 --> 05:43:45,590
We're sneaking?

5457
05:43:45,930 --> 05:43:46,070
Oh.

5458
05:43:46,770 --> 05:43:48,070
Wait, this is super stealthy.

5459
05:43:48,070 --> 05:43:49,050
Never mind.

5460
05:43:49,250 --> 05:43:50,650
My fat ass can't reach.

5461
05:43:51,170 --> 05:43:52,170
Gina, don't go that way.

5462
05:43:52,970 --> 05:43:53,750
I know!

5463
05:43:54,170 --> 05:43:54,550
Oh my god.

5464
05:43:54,930 --> 05:43:55,470
Gina.

5465
05:43:56,630 --> 05:43:56,870
Gina.

5466
05:43:57,130 --> 05:43:57,990
Don't get caught.

5467
05:43:58,230 --> 05:43:58,570
Please.

5468
05:43:59,010 --> 05:43:59,590
Please, Gina.

5469
05:43:59,930 --> 05:44:00,790
Don't get caught.

5470
05:44:02,150 --> 05:44:03,170
Oh my god, Gina.

5471
05:44:21,750 --> 05:44:22,290
Gina.

5472
05:44:23,330 --> 05:44:25,230
Gina, you're scaring me.

5473
05:44:34,140 --> 05:44:35,440
I can't get around here.

5474
05:44:35,720 --> 05:44:36,140
That sucks.

5475
05:44:40,210 --> 05:44:40,890
That noise.

5476
05:44:42,710 --> 05:44:44,170
I didn't know he was still there.

5477
05:44:53,360 --> 05:44:54,040
We're fine.

5478
05:44:54,300 --> 05:44:55,360
Oh, they had no weapons?

5479
05:44:56,080 --> 05:44:56,720
They had a gun.

5480
05:44:57,460 --> 05:44:58,640
But I don't want to use a gun.

5481
05:44:59,420 --> 05:45:00,420
I feel it will be too loud.

5482
05:45:01,460 --> 05:45:03,200
And really start alerting people, you know?

5483
05:45:04,820 --> 05:45:06,120
I just brushed him.

5484
05:45:07,460 --> 05:45:08,560
Oh, that's a weapon.

5485
05:45:13,160 --> 05:45:14,720
And... I can't have... Oh, wait.

5486
05:45:15,000 --> 05:45:15,940
Maybe I can eat some fruit.

5487
05:45:20,580 --> 05:45:21,840
And steal your fruit.

5488
05:45:24,060 --> 05:45:25,100
Prickly pear.

5489
05:45:25,280 --> 05:45:26,080
Prickly pear.

5490
05:45:27,420 --> 05:45:28,520
Who's checking me out?

5491
05:45:31,760 --> 05:45:33,000
Who's checking me out?

5492
05:45:35,260 --> 05:45:36,320
Over this way.

5493
05:45:39,200 --> 05:45:40,260
That guy right there?

5494
05:45:47,960 --> 05:45:48,840
No way.

5495
05:45:50,840 --> 05:45:51,280
Hide?

5496
05:45:59,120 --> 05:46:00,540
I think we're good, Gina.

5497
05:46:01,780 --> 05:46:03,020
Don't worry about it.

5498
05:46:03,240 --> 05:46:04,200
Just take all their money.

5499
05:46:07,100 --> 05:46:08,280
He's checking his list.

5500
05:46:09,260 --> 05:46:10,640
Who's checking me out?

5501
05:46:14,460 --> 05:46:15,200
Oh my god.

5502
05:46:15,280 --> 05:46:15,580
Oh my god.

5503
05:46:15,820 --> 05:46:16,680
Duck, duck, duck, duck.

5504
05:46:16,760 --> 05:46:17,100
There it is.

5505
05:46:17,560 --> 05:46:20,640
Wait, is this a... Oh, that's a flute.

5506
05:46:22,220 --> 05:46:24,260
I don't think it's very effective, probably.

5507
05:46:27,950 --> 05:46:30,310
I'm gonna throw this over yonder.

5508
05:46:31,010 --> 05:46:31,310
Damn it.

5509
05:46:32,670 --> 05:46:34,130
Damn it.

5510
05:46:34,490 --> 05:46:34,870
Damn it.

5511
05:46:35,490 --> 05:46:36,170
Damn it.

5512
05:46:36,410 --> 05:46:36,850
Damn it.

5513
05:46:37,010 --> 05:46:37,530
Damn it.

5514
05:46:41,830 --> 05:46:42,310
Ouch.

5515
05:46:44,750 --> 05:46:45,470
Oh my god.

5516
05:46:45,710 --> 05:46:46,310
He's a big guy.

5517
05:46:46,930 --> 05:46:47,690
Oh, he's big.

5518
05:46:55,770 --> 05:46:57,730
Where's your... Not your body.

5519
05:46:57,990 --> 05:46:59,070
Where's your...

5520
05:47:00,130 --> 05:47:01,070
Oh no!

5521
05:47:04,390 --> 05:47:08,690
Oh, he dodges.

5522
05:47:09,090 --> 05:47:09,810
Oh, they're too good.

5523
05:47:11,330 --> 05:47:12,050
They're too good.

5524
05:47:13,250 --> 05:47:13,870
Oh my god.

5525
05:47:13,930 --> 05:47:14,530
Oh, there it is.

5526
05:47:14,730 --> 05:47:15,130
Your club.

5527
05:47:15,250 --> 05:47:15,650
Thank you.

5528
05:47:18,890 --> 05:47:19,770
Hold on, Gina.

5529
05:47:20,070 --> 05:47:21,190
I might need to heal.

5530
05:47:22,230 --> 05:47:23,390
Gina, I need to heal.

5531
05:47:24,370 --> 05:47:26,310
Hold on for me.

5532
05:47:27,690 --> 05:47:28,130
Gosh.

5533
05:47:29,470 --> 05:47:31,290
Now I need the bread.

5534
05:47:36,390 --> 05:47:37,830
Why aren't they using the guns?

5535
05:47:38,710 --> 05:47:40,950
Luckily, they don't have bullets on their guns.

5536
05:47:41,070 --> 05:47:41,590
I know, right?

5537
05:47:42,470 --> 05:47:42,910
Gosh.

5538
05:47:43,330 --> 05:47:44,990
We will be stabbed a hundred times over.

5539
05:47:47,290 --> 05:47:48,290
Wait, where'd my...

5540
05:47:49,530 --> 05:47:50,170
Oh, there it is.

5541
05:47:50,250 --> 05:47:50,370
Okay.

5542
05:47:50,370 --> 05:47:51,650
Alright, perfect.

5543
05:47:51,850 --> 05:47:52,610
And we're going...

5544
05:47:53,710 --> 05:47:54,470
That way.

5545
05:47:56,090 --> 05:47:56,550
Hi, Gina.

5546
05:47:58,710 --> 05:48:01,310
Let's try... Distracting the guards.

5547
05:48:02,450 --> 05:48:02,910
Oh, wait.

5548
05:48:02,990 --> 05:48:03,370
I already...

5549
05:48:04,990 --> 05:48:05,790
Oh, shit.

5550
05:48:06,090 --> 05:48:08,410
There's not another bottle in here?

5551
05:48:09,230 --> 05:48:10,430
There was just one?

5552
05:48:14,110 --> 05:48:15,130
Only one?

5553
05:48:20,620 --> 05:48:21,660
Throw the loot.

5554
05:48:22,440 --> 05:48:22,920
Oh, wait.

5555
05:48:22,980 --> 05:48:23,800
I can grab this again.

5556
05:48:23,800 --> 05:48:25,080
There we go.

5557
05:48:25,160 --> 05:48:26,460
Alright, let's throw this bottle.

5558
05:48:27,400 --> 05:48:28,060
Oh, gosh.

5559
05:48:28,180 --> 05:48:28,920
You scared me, Gina.

5560
05:48:30,160 --> 05:48:31,720
Don't scare me like that.

5561
05:48:47,210 --> 05:48:49,010
I don't think they cared.

5562
05:48:53,370 --> 05:48:57,630
What's great is if you shoot them, they don't really care all that much.

5563
05:48:59,610 --> 05:49:02,370
Like, what I mean is...

5564
05:49:02,370 --> 05:49:02,830
Move!

5565
05:49:02,830 --> 05:49:03,370
Move!

5566
05:49:05,710 --> 05:49:06,670
Is they...

5567
05:49:07,470 --> 05:49:10,950
They don't say like, oh, we gotta alert the whole camp.

5568
05:49:11,230 --> 05:49:12,050
You know what I mean?

5569
05:49:12,910 --> 05:49:14,670
Where did I put my club?

5570
05:49:15,910 --> 05:49:17,430
Oh, I messed up, Gina.

5571
05:49:17,690 --> 05:49:18,050
Move.

5572
05:49:18,290 --> 05:49:19,570
I gotta go find it.

5573
05:49:21,470 --> 05:49:23,030
Well, at least put the shovel in here.

5574
05:49:24,150 --> 05:49:24,470
Alright.

5575
05:49:25,350 --> 05:49:28,490
Yeah, there's like no alarms that goes off and signals everyone.

5576
05:49:29,190 --> 05:49:30,630
That's what I was trying to say.

5577
05:49:30,630 --> 05:49:32,470
Yeah, they just don't care when you shoot them.

5578
05:49:32,650 --> 05:49:33,830
Yeah, you know.

5579
05:49:35,130 --> 05:49:35,610
Whatever.

5580
05:49:36,350 --> 05:49:36,950
They don't care.

5581
05:49:37,630 --> 05:49:38,470
I don't care.

5582
05:49:40,150 --> 05:49:41,250
What else is in here?

5583
05:49:43,250 --> 05:49:43,690
Money.

5584
05:49:47,270 --> 05:49:48,550
I love looting.

5585
05:50:02,480 --> 05:50:02,960
Gina!

5586
05:50:03,260 --> 05:50:03,740
Gina!

5587
05:50:03,900 --> 05:50:05,120
Gina, I can use your help!

5588
05:50:08,380 --> 05:50:08,820
Gina!

5589
05:50:11,640 --> 05:50:12,940
Gina, I can use your help!

5590
05:50:13,400 --> 05:50:13,720
Gina!

5591
05:50:14,380 --> 05:50:14,820
Gina!

5592
05:50:15,420 --> 05:50:15,860
Gina!

5593
05:50:16,580 --> 05:50:17,020
Gina!

5594
05:50:17,200 --> 05:50:18,100
I can use your help!

5595
05:50:18,280 --> 05:50:18,680
Thank you.

5596
05:50:20,840 --> 05:50:22,100
Yeah, she can take a few hits.

5597
05:50:33,120 --> 05:50:34,260
Good job, Gina.

5598
05:50:34,540 --> 05:50:35,980
You took a few hits for me.

5599
05:50:39,080 --> 05:50:39,520
Nice.

5600
05:50:40,700 --> 05:50:42,720
Alright, that's where we're supposed to go in there, right?

5601
05:50:43,180 --> 05:50:43,540
Yep.

5602
05:50:43,960 --> 05:50:46,520
I don't know why it's telling us to go up there first, but...

5603
05:50:47,420 --> 05:50:50,360
I'm just not gonna listen to that and I'm gonna go through the front door.

5604
05:50:53,640 --> 05:50:55,220
That seems like a better idea.

5605
05:51:01,600 --> 05:51:02,320
Opens elsewhere?

5606
05:51:09,040 --> 05:51:09,400
Okay.

5607
05:51:11,120 --> 05:51:11,480
Okay.

5608
05:51:14,740 --> 05:51:16,020
Like up there?

5609
05:51:16,540 --> 05:51:18,420
Why do I need to go up there?

5610
05:51:21,920 --> 05:51:23,420
What was the point?

5611
05:51:30,500 --> 05:51:32,000
Wait, this is the same way.

5612
05:51:44,300 --> 05:51:46,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5613
05:51:46,760 --> 05:51:47,560
Look at him.

5614
05:51:47,760 --> 05:51:48,680
He's retreating!

5615
05:51:53,420 --> 05:51:53,920
Uh-oh.

5616
05:51:55,640 --> 05:51:55,960
Where?

5617
05:51:56,840 --> 05:51:58,460
No, this in here.

5618
05:51:58,620 --> 05:51:59,040
Come on, Gina!

5619
05:51:59,420 --> 05:51:59,920
Come on!

5620
05:52:00,120 --> 05:52:00,680
Come on, come on.

5621
05:52:01,040 --> 05:52:03,060
Come on, come on.

5622
05:52:04,900 --> 05:52:05,540
Just leave.

5623
05:52:06,160 --> 05:52:06,820
Just get out of here.

5624
05:52:12,500 --> 05:52:12,820
Stealth!

5625
05:52:15,380 --> 05:52:17,060
Damn, I was gonna say, how is he still up?

5626
05:52:17,560 --> 05:52:18,940
Now I have a stick, but only...

5627
05:52:20,940 --> 05:52:22,340
He literally put his gun away.

5628
05:52:28,040 --> 05:52:28,980
We got him.

5629
05:52:31,200 --> 05:52:32,580
Why did you put your gun away?

5630
05:52:34,620 --> 05:52:35,600
Alright, let's go up here.

5631
05:52:37,980 --> 05:52:39,260
He likes a fair fight.

5632
05:52:43,180 --> 05:52:47,500
And there will keep being enemies down, or allies down.

5633
05:52:48,440 --> 05:52:49,980
As long as I'm here.

5634
05:52:49,980 --> 05:52:54,500
It is September and after the battle of Abourkir Bay.

5635
05:52:54,880 --> 05:52:56,540
Our forces have surrendered to the British.

5636
05:52:56,940 --> 05:52:58,800
We have but a year to leave Egypt.

5637
05:52:59,180 --> 05:53:02,020
I hope we can transport our most valuable of items home.

5638
05:53:02,420 --> 05:53:03,380
Like the Rosetta Stone.

5639
05:53:03,620 --> 05:53:11,980
I think we're

5640
05:53:20,070 --> 05:53:20,330
fine.

5641
05:53:23,730 --> 05:53:26,630
Sorry, I got paranoid that someone was gonna come up the stairs.

5642
05:53:28,810 --> 05:53:31,230
Okay, let's keep going up.

5643
05:53:36,270 --> 05:53:37,700
Is this the wrong way?

5644
05:53:40,060 --> 05:53:41,620
Oh, there he is!

5645
05:53:44,110 --> 05:53:45,940
We'll just ignore him.

5646
05:53:53,810 --> 05:53:55,090
From here, I think?

5647
05:53:58,030 --> 05:53:58,970
There

5648
05:54:02,540 --> 05:54:04,100
we go!

5649
05:54:12,880 --> 05:54:14,660
I think that was the guys downstairs.

5650
05:54:17,300 --> 05:54:18,860
Oh, we put our outfit on!

5651
05:54:19,860 --> 05:54:20,580
Indie time.

5652
05:54:22,740 --> 05:54:24,480
Okay, got lots of bottles.

5653
05:54:26,700 --> 05:54:28,800
I could probably heal.

5654
05:54:34,870 --> 05:54:36,030
Hit the strong box?

5655
05:54:36,350 --> 05:54:36,950
Wait, where?

5656
05:54:37,530 --> 05:54:40,090
Oh no, I don't think it was, because it didn't turn red.

5657
05:54:41,630 --> 05:54:43,090
I don't think it was a strong box.

5658
05:54:43,090 --> 05:54:44,870
Because the little...

5659
05:54:46,410 --> 05:54:49,050
The little white dot in the middle, what's it called?

5660
05:54:49,290 --> 05:54:50,150
It turned red.

5661
05:54:52,610 --> 05:54:54,570
It opens from the other side.

5662
05:54:56,130 --> 05:54:57,710
How do we get downstairs?

5663
05:54:58,010 --> 05:54:58,390
Oh, here.

5664
05:55:00,550 --> 05:55:02,790
I'm literally pulling up the floorboards.

5665
05:55:03,430 --> 05:55:03,950
Okay,

5666
05:55:09,810 --> 05:55:10,990
back to eating dinner.

5667
05:55:23,340 --> 05:55:25,540
Why is the music so loud?

5668
05:55:43,080 --> 05:55:45,140
Is he gonna get killed?

5669
05:55:58,600 --> 05:55:59,160
Okay.

5670
05:56:02,360 --> 05:56:03,300
Why is this a good cutscene?

5671
05:56:03,520 --> 05:56:03,600
Okay.

5672
05:56:22,070 --> 05:56:24,970
The most German monkey sounds I've ever heard.

5673
05:56:33,670 --> 05:56:35,790
How do you want to make up for it?

5674
05:56:36,510 --> 05:56:40,470
Do you hope that the solution will give you another chance?

5675
05:56:44,610 --> 05:56:45,450
Oops.

5676
05:56:51,510 --> 05:56:52,870
Return to monkey.

5677
05:56:55,490 --> 05:56:56,330
Hi!

5678
05:56:56,330 --> 05:56:56,630
Hi!

5679
05:56:58,450 --> 05:56:59,370
Hey!

5680
05:57:03,190 --> 05:57:04,870
This is so sad.

5681
05:57:18,050 --> 05:57:23,050
I like his poofy pants.

5682
05:57:26,530 --> 05:57:26,930
Oh!

5683
05:57:32,190 --> 05:57:33,070
Where's the other guy?

5684
05:57:33,470 --> 05:57:34,530
Did we fall on top of him?

5685
05:57:35,810 --> 05:57:37,330
Maybe we should watch him too.

5686
05:57:51,830 --> 05:57:53,170
Do you think he's dead?

5687
05:57:58,670 --> 05:57:59,310
Oh!

5688
05:58:02,670 --> 05:58:04,870
It won't let me shoot him!

5689
05:58:07,430 --> 05:58:09,450
It won't let me shoot him!

5690
05:58:09,790 --> 05:58:11,130
That's so messed up.

5691
05:58:11,450 --> 05:58:14,330
Okay, I think this might have a time limit, so...

5692
05:58:15,070 --> 05:58:15,710
Dependent.

5693
05:58:19,570 --> 05:58:21,830
No way, time paradox real.

5694
05:58:28,190 --> 05:58:30,330
I know, don't tell me it's about a woman, yes?

5695
05:58:31,150 --> 05:58:31,290
What?

5696
05:58:31,290 --> 05:58:35,990
It is always about a woman, isn't it?

5697
05:58:50,460 --> 05:58:59,070
I mean is he wrong though?

5698
05:58:59,450 --> 05:58:59,790
No.

5699
05:59:06,950 --> 05:59:09,390
I could fix him, I don't know.

5700
05:59:09,670 --> 05:59:10,050
What?

5701
05:59:10,190 --> 05:59:11,670
The guys are still yelling at him.

5702
05:59:27,150 --> 05:59:30,990
How low are we crouching if we look like that when we crouch?

5703
05:59:31,190 --> 05:59:32,790
And on his knees he looks like that.

5704
05:59:33,650 --> 05:59:34,750
Okay, let's examine.

5705
05:59:40,830 --> 05:59:47,550
I'm getting a picture.

5706
05:59:52,330 --> 05:59:52,930
I'm getting a picture.

5707
05:59:59,810 --> 06:00:02,010
We didn't debug him!

5708
06:00:17,850 --> 06:00:21,710
Stop giving him clues, Cindy!

5709
06:00:25,470 --> 06:00:29,250
This is far beyond your understanding, Dr. Jones.

5710
06:00:39,350 --> 06:00:40,550
Stop talking!

5711
06:00:42,670 --> 06:00:44,590
Oh, maybe he already knows.

5712
06:00:53,360 --> 06:00:54,960
Okay, so he knows.

5713
06:00:55,860 --> 06:00:56,560
Okay, he knows.

5714
06:00:59,420 --> 06:01:02,480
Don't insult a nerd, they will out-nerd you.

5715
06:01:15,660 --> 06:01:16,220
Yeah!

5716
06:01:18,800 --> 06:01:19,400
Do it anyway!

5717
06:01:32,720 --> 06:01:33,320
Okay.

5718
06:01:41,260 --> 06:01:46,620
He deserves it, probably.

5719
06:01:50,660 --> 06:01:52,860
See, I told you we should have shot him!

5720
06:01:53,480 --> 06:01:54,400
I told you!

5721
06:01:58,920 --> 06:02:00,220
The game!

5722
06:02:00,500 --> 06:02:01,180
What a lover!

5723
06:02:11,750 --> 06:02:14,850
Get your nose broken, Voss.

5724
06:02:15,290 --> 06:02:16,790
Not Huey, Emmerich.

5725
06:02:22,450 --> 06:02:24,250
Oh my god!

5726
06:02:24,650 --> 06:02:25,710
Maybe he is a real monkey!

5727
06:02:25,710 --> 06:02:25,770
Monkey!

5728
06:02:32,730 --> 06:02:34,490
Did he shoot the painting?

5729
06:02:42,160 --> 06:02:43,280
Oh girl!

5730
06:02:43,880 --> 06:02:44,280
Oh girl!

5731
06:02:44,460 --> 06:02:45,000
Oh girl!

5732
06:02:45,260 --> 06:02:46,260
Oh my god, no!

5733
06:02:52,300 --> 06:02:53,340
No way!

5734
06:02:53,600 --> 06:02:54,720
Is this Looney Tunes?

5735
06:03:18,970 --> 06:03:21,370
Do me a favor, my friend.

5736
06:03:21,650 --> 06:03:22,450
Go to a dentist.

5737
06:03:33,450 --> 06:03:40,050
Oh my god!

5738
06:03:49,090 --> 06:03:50,210
Another tunnel?

5739
06:03:54,430 --> 06:03:55,390
Okay, let's go.

5740
06:03:58,590 --> 06:04:00,250
I wish I could fight everyone.

5741
06:04:02,130 --> 06:04:03,850
I want to fight the whole world.

5742
06:04:07,070 --> 06:04:08,410
Fists are blazing.

5743
06:04:09,830 --> 06:04:15,130
I want to...I want to have a fight club where everyone just comes and fights me.

5744
06:04:18,430 --> 06:04:21,710
Okay, we are going this way.

5745
06:04:26,430 --> 06:04:28,270
Wisp fight club win.

5746
06:04:29,830 --> 06:04:30,510
Now.

5747
06:04:33,710 --> 06:04:34,670
Wow!

5748
06:04:35,630 --> 06:04:36,430
Oh my god.

5749
06:04:38,930 --> 06:04:40,090
Oh shit.

5750
06:04:40,670 --> 06:04:41,030
Go?

5751
06:04:42,750 --> 06:04:44,090
I'm trying to get over?

5752
06:04:47,290 --> 06:04:47,890
Run!

5753
06:04:48,930 --> 06:04:48,930
Run!

5754
06:04:49,070 --> 06:04:49,250
Run!

5755
06:04:49,490 --> 06:04:50,630
Oh my god!

5756
06:04:51,650 --> 06:04:52,270
You do?

5757
06:04:52,570 --> 06:04:53,650
I don't see anybody!

5758
06:04:54,490 --> 06:04:54,930
Is that her?

5759
06:04:55,350 --> 06:04:56,130
I sure hope so.

5760
06:04:58,850 --> 06:04:59,810
Into the tunnel!

5761
06:05:04,690 --> 06:05:06,430
That was so fun!

5762
06:05:13,360 --> 06:05:14,280
Oh my god.

5763
06:05:16,140 --> 06:05:18,360
Are you alright?

5764
06:05:21,660 --> 06:05:24,940
I think half of her is in the ground.

5765
06:05:33,980 --> 06:05:35,780
I don't know where to go.

5766
06:05:37,440 --> 06:05:39,260
You've kind of...okay, let me follow you.

5767
06:05:43,920 --> 06:05:44,820
Oh, there we go.

5768
06:05:48,980 --> 06:05:50,340
I was a little lost.

5769
06:05:50,600 --> 06:05:51,940
I'm just a slithery snake.

5770
06:05:52,640 --> 06:05:53,980
Very nutty buddy game.

5771
06:05:55,920 --> 06:05:56,960
Oh my god.

5772
06:06:19,240 --> 06:06:19,780
Okay.

5773
06:06:26,860 --> 06:06:28,740
Are you sure about that?

5774
06:06:29,280 --> 06:06:30,160
What do you mean?

5775
06:06:30,400 --> 06:06:34,520
If it's not the...you said exit tunnel.

5776
06:06:36,180 --> 06:06:36,720
Thank you.

5777
06:06:39,560 --> 06:06:41,840
If it's an exit tunnel...

5778
06:06:42,420 --> 06:06:43,840
It's not an exit tunnel.

5779
06:06:44,920 --> 06:06:46,900
This would also be technically an exit tunnel.

5780
06:06:48,080 --> 06:06:48,640
Right?

5781
06:06:49,640 --> 06:06:50,560
If there's an exit.

5782
06:06:51,540 --> 06:06:52,660
I'm exploring.

5783
06:06:53,040 --> 06:06:54,880
I'm just trying to find some cool stuff.

5784
06:06:55,760 --> 06:06:58,040
Nobody lets me ever do what I want to do.

5785
06:06:58,920 --> 06:07:01,200
I'm sick of being Indiana Jones.

5786
06:07:17,270 --> 06:07:17,770
Okay.

5787
06:07:18,910 --> 06:07:19,890
Where are we?

5788
06:07:20,890 --> 06:07:23,490
Why are all the lights so bright all the time?

5789
06:07:31,460 --> 06:07:31,960
Okay.

5790
06:07:32,280 --> 06:07:33,760
Doesn't seem like there's much of anything else.

5791
06:07:34,680 --> 06:07:35,180
John!

5792
06:07:35,300 --> 06:07:38,900
Thank you so much for the loot.

5793
06:07:39,020 --> 06:07:39,740
Thank you so much.

5794
06:07:40,280 --> 06:07:42,580
Harrison Ford can do whatever he wants to me.

5795
06:07:43,400 --> 06:07:43,880
Brian!

5796
06:07:44,240 --> 06:07:45,100
Down boy, down!

5797
06:07:55,660 --> 06:07:56,060
Oh.

5798
06:07:57,960 --> 06:07:58,660
This way?

5799
06:08:03,220 --> 06:08:04,320
Oh, wrong thing.

5800
06:08:09,300 --> 06:08:10,060
Here we go.

5801
06:08:10,180 --> 06:08:11,020
Oh my gosh, sorry guys.

5802
06:08:11,320 --> 06:08:12,660
I'm always pressing the wrong buttons.

5803
06:08:13,960 --> 06:08:14,920
In here, right?

5804
06:08:18,480 --> 06:08:19,820
This is the way...

5805
06:08:20,600 --> 06:08:21,120
This way?

5806
06:08:21,340 --> 06:08:22,100
Is that what you're talking about?

5807
06:08:22,140 --> 06:08:22,620
This way, right?

5808
06:08:31,510 --> 06:08:32,910
Wow!

5809
06:08:51,060 --> 06:08:54,440
A little snake!

5810
06:09:03,320 --> 06:09:07,480
Someone put their snake in the Egypt hole.

5811
06:09:11,740 --> 06:09:13,300
Danger noodle.

5812
06:09:14,520 --> 06:09:15,960
He's so cute.

5813
06:09:16,040 --> 06:09:16,480
I love snakes.

5814
06:09:23,480 --> 06:09:25,640
The Guardians?

5815
06:09:35,080 --> 06:09:36,480
It's the Nephilim Order.

5816
06:09:38,220 --> 06:09:44,600
The Nephilim Order working with the ancient Egyptians thousands of years before the rise of the Christian Church.

5817
06:09:48,070 --> 06:09:52,490
Only the Guardians carry the key to unlock the enigma...

5818
06:09:53,330 --> 06:09:54,610
of Haramaket.

5819
06:09:54,990 --> 06:09:56,310
Horus of the Horizon.

5820
06:09:56,610 --> 06:09:57,810
Revered in the form of...

5821
06:09:57,810 --> 06:09:58,630
The Sphinx!

5822
06:09:59,690 --> 06:10:01,410
And opened the way into the Safehold.

5823
06:10:01,410 --> 06:10:05,190
Must be a reference to the Dream Stele.

5824
06:10:05,330 --> 06:10:07,430
This is what Vos has been looking for.

5825
06:10:07,710 --> 06:10:09,410
How to unlock the Dream Stele.

5826
06:10:16,030 --> 06:10:17,790
The Dream Stele.

5827
06:10:21,250 --> 06:10:22,350
Not unlock.

5828
06:10:24,670 --> 06:10:25,310
Solve.

5829
06:10:27,570 --> 06:10:29,190
It's not a physical key.

5830
06:10:30,850 --> 06:10:32,010
It's the tattoo.

5831
06:10:32,010 --> 06:10:32,710
Tattoo?

5832
06:10:34,310 --> 06:10:36,110
The Dream Stele is encrypted.

5833
06:10:36,990 --> 06:10:38,190
The tattoo on the Nephilim.

5834
06:10:38,430 --> 06:10:38,970
The Guardians.

5835
06:10:39,970 --> 06:10:42,350
Must be the decoding key to solving the cipher.

5836
06:10:44,130 --> 06:10:46,290
And it's been under Vos' nose the entire time.

5837
06:10:49,090 --> 06:10:51,350
Now I just need to pay a visit to the Sphinx.

5838
06:10:51,350 --> 06:10:52,850
We were just there.

5839
06:10:56,370 --> 06:10:57,170
Ok.

5840
06:11:03,470 --> 06:11:04,870
Oh my God.

5841
06:11:05,150 --> 06:11:06,370
Please, my eyes.

5842
06:11:21,350 --> 06:11:21,670
Ok.

5843
06:11:27,370 --> 06:11:30,170
Am I going the right way, Dame Noire?

5844
06:11:35,080 --> 06:11:35,880
Yes.

5845
06:11:37,460 --> 06:11:38,260
Yes?

5846
06:11:41,380 --> 06:11:42,180
Yes.

5847
06:11:46,320 --> 06:11:48,200
Where is the...

5848
06:11:49,400 --> 06:11:50,800
Let's start digging.

5849
06:11:50,800 --> 06:11:51,420
Wait.

5850
06:11:51,600 --> 06:11:53,120
Where is the wall weak?

5851
06:11:53,680 --> 06:11:54,580
Over here?

5852
06:11:57,880 --> 06:11:58,800
Over...

5853
06:11:58,800 --> 06:12:00,200
Where?

5854
06:12:02,640 --> 06:12:03,920
Over there.

5855
06:12:04,240 --> 06:12:04,800
Over here.

5856
06:12:06,120 --> 06:12:06,580
Here?

5857
06:12:15,710 --> 06:12:17,710
Where is the weak wall?

5858
06:12:20,650 --> 06:12:22,070
I see it.

5859
06:12:22,590 --> 06:12:23,510
Sorry.

5860
06:12:23,510 --> 06:12:25,330
She is blind.

5861
06:12:31,140 --> 06:12:33,000
I play Minecraft.

5862
06:12:36,260 --> 06:12:37,360
Blind Minto.

5863
06:12:48,360 --> 06:12:49,500
Pocket sand.

5864
06:12:50,300 --> 06:12:52,260
Get pocket sanded.

5865
06:12:54,500 --> 06:12:55,760
You're welcome.

5866
06:13:22,260 --> 06:13:22,580
Which one?

5867
06:13:38,120 --> 06:13:40,800
I know what you are.

5868
06:13:44,160 --> 06:13:45,800
That's my birthday.

5869
06:13:46,100 --> 06:13:46,720
Pika!

5870
06:13:47,360 --> 06:13:50,160
I think you have the cutest model in Merry Christmas.

5871
06:13:50,360 --> 06:13:51,460
Merry Christmas!

5872
06:13:51,780 --> 06:13:53,080
Happy birthday, Pika!

5873
06:14:10,320 --> 06:14:11,840
Merry Christmas!

5874
06:14:12,740 --> 06:14:14,160
Thank you!

5875
06:14:14,160 --> 06:14:17,180
I hope you have a great day!

5876
06:14:18,260 --> 06:14:20,100
Oh wow, we really just shoved him in there.

5877
06:14:20,960 --> 06:14:21,400
Nice.

5878
06:14:23,140 --> 06:14:24,020
Who sneezed?

5879
06:14:33,150 --> 06:14:34,270
There we go.

5880
06:14:36,610 --> 06:14:38,130
And for you, mister?

5881
06:14:40,230 --> 06:14:41,470
A little whack-a-roo.

5882
06:14:42,670 --> 06:14:44,090
If only I could get to you.

5883
06:14:46,350 --> 06:14:50,170
Alright, this game is very nice about giving lots of...

5884
06:14:50,170 --> 06:14:50,610
Oh, perfect.

5885
06:14:51,070 --> 06:14:53,310
Lots of bandages and such.

5886
06:14:54,610 --> 06:14:56,310
We could probably go back to the...

5887
06:14:56,310 --> 06:14:57,010
What's in here?

5888
06:14:58,150 --> 06:15:02,090
Probably go back to the village and grab some...

5889
06:15:04,430 --> 06:15:04,930
What?

5890
06:15:05,450 --> 06:15:06,410
Actual mine.

5891
06:15:07,550 --> 06:15:08,870
Grab some stuff from the store.

5892
06:15:08,990 --> 06:15:09,730
I think I have enough money.

5893
06:15:09,890 --> 06:15:10,650
Maybe some of the books.

5894
06:15:16,370 --> 06:15:16,810
Hello!

5895
06:15:23,130 --> 06:15:23,570
Perfect!

5896
06:15:27,450 --> 06:15:28,630
The tower has got stuff.

5897
06:15:28,750 --> 06:15:29,150
Ok, cool.

5898
06:15:30,230 --> 06:15:31,570
Might want to check the tower before leaving.

5899
06:15:31,710 --> 06:15:32,270
Oh, tower.

5900
06:15:34,910 --> 06:15:35,770
Thank you guys.

5901
06:15:40,510 --> 06:15:42,170
We are about to leave Giza?

5902
06:15:44,370 --> 06:15:45,410
We are done here?

5903
06:15:46,970 --> 06:15:48,350
I don't have the key!

5904
06:15:50,470 --> 06:15:52,150
I don't have the key!

5905
06:15:52,830 --> 06:15:53,870
I never got the key!

5906
06:15:57,740 --> 06:15:58,940
Is that a uniform?

5907
06:16:01,280 --> 06:16:02,760
The key is inside.

5908
06:16:03,780 --> 06:16:04,320
Ok, wait.

5909
06:16:04,420 --> 06:16:04,820
Hold on.

5910
06:16:13,160 --> 06:16:14,200
What's my...

5911
06:16:14,200 --> 06:16:15,480
Yeah, we can eat these.

5912
06:16:15,480 --> 06:16:16,120
Take

5913
06:16:20,270 --> 06:16:22,370
that.

5914
06:16:22,530 --> 06:16:23,550
How do I get up there?

5915
06:16:24,550 --> 06:16:26,270
Gotta do some parkour, baby!

5916
06:16:27,010 --> 06:16:27,550
Ok, hold on.

5917
06:16:29,130 --> 06:16:30,610
Gotta figure out how to get up there.

5918
06:16:40,360 --> 06:16:42,640
Do I see anywhere that I can...

5919
06:16:42,640 --> 06:16:43,000
What?

5920
06:16:49,500 --> 06:16:50,180
Sorry.

5921
06:16:51,020 --> 06:16:51,800
Oh my god.

5922
06:16:51,880 --> 06:16:53,840
I don't want to walk all the way down there.

5923
06:16:55,300 --> 06:16:56,060
Congrats on 300k.

5924
06:16:56,120 --> 06:16:56,800
Thank you!

5925
06:16:57,500 --> 06:16:58,640
Appreciate it.

5926
06:17:04,700 --> 06:17:05,380
Gesundheit.

5927
06:17:06,720 --> 06:17:07,400
How fitting.

5928
06:17:09,060 --> 06:17:10,180
Many are German today.

5929
06:17:10,180 --> 06:17:13,040
Look on the other side.

5930
06:17:13,220 --> 06:17:13,380
Wait.

5931
06:17:14,400 --> 06:17:15,220
The other side of the building.

5932
06:17:36,590 --> 06:17:38,930
Where does the paint go to?

5933
06:17:44,320 --> 06:17:45,000
Hold on.

5934
06:17:45,380 --> 06:17:46,780
Maybe I can circle around the other side.

5935
06:17:46,840 --> 06:17:47,200
There we go.

5936
06:17:51,370 --> 06:17:51,750
Nice.

5937
06:17:52,690 --> 06:17:54,550
Are any of these windows open?

5938
06:17:55,810 --> 06:17:56,610
Any of them.

5939
06:17:56,610 --> 06:18:00,150
Any of these windows open?

5940
06:18:01,330 --> 06:18:02,310
None of them.

5941
06:18:03,930 --> 06:18:05,230
None of them so far.

5942
06:18:14,060 --> 06:18:16,240
I'll wait for him to turn the rack around.

5943
06:18:18,060 --> 06:18:18,820
Ok, buddy.

5944
06:18:24,920 --> 06:18:26,420
That's what that...

5945
06:18:26,420 --> 06:18:30,340
Are you in your underwear?

5946
06:18:37,330 --> 06:18:38,810
Stop blocking.

5947
06:18:41,810 --> 06:18:42,690
Yeah.

5948
06:18:43,430 --> 06:18:43,810
Dummy.

5949
06:18:44,730 --> 06:18:46,550
I wish blocking didn't use stamina.

5950
06:18:48,210 --> 06:18:48,830
Can I go down?

5951
06:18:56,880 --> 06:18:57,760
Wait.

5952
06:18:58,480 --> 06:18:59,380
What is this?

5953
06:19:00,180 --> 06:19:00,660
Bullets.

5954
06:19:03,960 --> 06:19:05,440
Got a new weapon.

5955
06:19:07,480 --> 06:19:09,580
You can charge a punch if you can break their block.

5956
06:19:10,620 --> 06:19:12,100
And then this is the key, right?

5957
06:19:12,440 --> 06:19:12,640
Nope.

5958
06:19:12,840 --> 06:19:13,880
It's a money baby.

5959
06:19:16,400 --> 06:19:17,120
Let's go.

5960
06:19:21,900 --> 06:19:23,200
Is that why you were naked?

5961
06:19:24,740 --> 06:19:28,160
You literally were...

5962
06:19:28,160 --> 06:19:29,260
What's this?

5963
06:19:32,020 --> 06:19:32,460
Naughty.

5964
06:19:33,880 --> 06:19:34,320
Naughty.

5965
06:19:37,740 --> 06:19:38,180
Naughty.

5966
06:19:42,700 --> 06:19:43,140
Ok.

5967
06:19:43,140 --> 06:19:44,320
I'm going to change now.

5968
06:19:44,480 --> 06:19:44,840
Oh wait.

5969
06:19:48,360 --> 06:19:49,180
This will do.

5970
06:19:51,660 --> 06:19:53,660
But it doesn't have the key in here.

5971
06:19:53,820 --> 06:19:54,360
I guess that's fine.

5972
06:19:54,420 --> 06:19:55,460
We'll just unlock it from...

5973
06:19:56,180 --> 06:19:57,320
Oh, I did get the key.

5974
06:19:57,440 --> 06:19:58,500
Oh, it came with a uniform.

5975
06:20:00,940 --> 06:20:03,460
I can go back and...

5976
06:20:05,940 --> 06:20:06,340
Alright.

5977
06:20:06,340 --> 06:20:06,740
Hello.

5978
06:20:09,560 --> 06:20:10,460
What did you say?

5979
06:20:10,620 --> 06:20:12,340
Oh, the person wanted more stuff, right?

5980
06:20:12,920 --> 06:20:13,140
Alright.

5981
06:20:13,340 --> 06:20:14,800
Inspect the dreams daily.

5982
06:20:15,600 --> 06:20:17,600
What other things we got in here before we head out?

5983
06:20:18,100 --> 06:20:19,520
We did all the field work.

5984
06:20:20,040 --> 06:20:20,700
Kinda crazy.

5985
06:20:24,740 --> 06:20:26,960
But there is so much.

5986
06:20:27,260 --> 06:20:30,880
I feel like I haven't even touched everything in this.

5987
06:20:32,720 --> 06:20:37,420
Like there is the meteorologist station I barely looked at.

5988
06:20:37,600 --> 06:20:39,440
Anything past that I barely looked at.

5989
06:20:39,840 --> 06:20:41,160
The vehicle store.

5990
06:20:41,360 --> 06:20:44,440
There is so much to explore in this game.

5991
06:20:44,900 --> 06:20:46,000
It's insane.

5992
06:20:46,000 --> 06:20:49,240
There is

5993
06:20:52,620 --> 06:20:53,320
one in the city.

5994
06:20:53,720 --> 06:20:54,720
A field work in the city.

5995
06:20:58,660 --> 06:21:03,940
Like I don't plan on doing some of the side quests like the fight club, stuff like that, whatever, whatever, but...

5996
06:21:09,680 --> 06:21:10,120
Chilling.

5997
06:21:15,020 --> 06:21:15,460
Sola!

5998
06:21:16,040 --> 06:21:17,560
Where is that guy?

5999
06:21:21,020 --> 06:21:23,460
Maybe they couldn't find a good voice actor.

6000
06:21:23,700 --> 06:21:24,320
I don't know.

6001
06:21:26,480 --> 06:21:30,180
Or maybe they were just like, you know, it's indie but we'll do new characters.

6002
06:21:30,440 --> 06:21:31,020
I don't know.

6003
06:21:34,080 --> 06:21:34,560
Sola.

6004
06:21:35,060 --> 06:21:36,780
Like we can go in there and we can fight.

6005
06:21:39,880 --> 06:21:41,140
Rosie, thank you!

6006
06:21:41,460 --> 06:21:43,540
First time I'm catching you streaming your model design.

6007
06:21:43,560 --> 06:21:44,020
It's so lovely.

6008
06:21:44,020 --> 06:21:50,720
I call you my human based VTuber discovery of 2024 as an AI VTuber guy.

6009
06:22:00,750 --> 06:22:02,090
She's very cute.

6010
06:22:02,330 --> 06:22:03,250
I'm also a fan.

6011
06:22:04,730 --> 06:22:08,210
Are there many other AI VTubers I wonder?

6012
06:22:09,210 --> 06:22:10,830
I haven't heard of any others.

6013
06:22:11,930 --> 06:22:12,970
Quite honestly.

6014
06:22:18,380 --> 06:22:19,460
Parked car.

6015
06:22:19,660 --> 06:22:20,340
Come on.

6016
06:22:20,840 --> 06:22:21,700
Why is this so difficult?

6017
06:22:24,500 --> 06:22:26,520
Well, some guy is also missing a basket.

6018
06:22:29,880 --> 06:22:30,880
Am I AI?

6019
06:22:31,960 --> 06:22:32,280
Yeah.

6020
06:22:34,380 --> 06:22:35,560
Ask me anything.

6021
06:22:36,140 --> 06:22:37,300
I'll give you an answer.

6022
06:22:40,870 --> 06:22:41,970
The others are small.

6023
06:22:42,230 --> 06:22:43,570
Oh, I see, I see.

6024
06:22:44,070 --> 06:22:44,770
I've seen like two.

6025
06:22:49,200 --> 06:22:52,420
Okay, so yeah, the Sphinx is where we got the...

6026
06:22:53,100 --> 06:22:54,220
What's your favorite movie?

6027
06:22:55,260 --> 06:22:56,860
My favorite movie...

6028
06:22:57,640 --> 06:23:00,420
My favorite movie is...

6029
06:23:04,000 --> 06:23:06,520
The tape your mom and I made last night.

6030
06:23:11,500 --> 06:23:12,320
Got'em.

6031
06:23:22,900 --> 06:23:24,240
Don't frowny face!

6032
06:23:24,240 --> 06:23:24,320
Don't frowny face!

6033
06:23:31,820 --> 06:23:33,800
Minto, I'm sorry that you didn't win Miss VTuber.

6034
06:23:34,120 --> 06:23:40,300
But as a consolation, will you accept this great circle from me and be my Mrs. VTuber?

6035
06:23:43,640 --> 06:23:45,560
Oh my god.

6036
06:23:47,880 --> 06:23:49,780
Wow, that was pretty good.

6037
06:23:49,860 --> 06:23:50,860
I'm not gonna lie.

6038
06:23:52,640 --> 06:23:53,960
That was pretty good.

6039
06:24:00,000 --> 06:24:00,480
I...

6040
06:24:01,640 --> 06:24:06,880
You know, for the... I didn't talk really about the VTuber awards or anything like that.

6041
06:24:07,800 --> 06:24:12,500
But, you know, just being nominated for anything honestly made me feel...

6042
06:24:12,500 --> 06:24:15,000
Feel good, so don't feel bad.

6043
06:24:15,040 --> 06:24:17,220
And also my Oshi won, so...

6044
06:24:17,220 --> 06:24:18,940
A win for my Oshi is a win for me.

6045
06:24:19,200 --> 06:24:21,000
I even voted for Kiara, so...

6046
06:24:22,040 --> 06:24:25,220
So honestly, I'm super duper... I'm super duper happy.

6047
06:24:29,000 --> 06:24:29,440
Mhmm.

6048
06:24:30,380 --> 06:24:32,000
Like I didn't walk around down here at all.

6049
06:24:32,060 --> 06:24:33,460
I think that guy we gotta avoid though.

6050
06:24:36,280 --> 06:24:36,860
Bless you.

6051
06:24:38,840 --> 06:24:39,780
Like in here?

6052
06:24:39,940 --> 06:24:41,060
There's all this stuff we have.

6053
06:24:41,140 --> 06:24:41,680
What is this?

6054
06:24:44,420 --> 06:24:45,460
I can't read.

6055
06:24:49,040 --> 06:24:50,180
Let me in.

6056
06:24:51,000 --> 06:24:51,600
Record...

6057
06:25:00,090 --> 06:25:02,130
Haunted... Haunted Crypt Key?

6058
06:25:04,490 --> 06:25:05,090
How?

6059
06:25:10,220 --> 06:25:10,520
How?

6060
06:25:13,480 --> 06:25:21,700
I also knew that I didn't win because I was talking to Doki and she was like, oh yeah, did Filian contact you about recording any videos?

6061
06:25:22,840 --> 06:25:26,440
And I was just like... She had asked me about something, but...

6062
06:25:30,370 --> 06:25:33,670
And I was... But it wasn't like about a...

6063
06:25:37,110 --> 06:25:39,750
About like a award winning video.

6064
06:25:41,150 --> 06:25:44,370
So Doki was just like, oh yeah, then you didn't win.

6065
06:25:46,410 --> 06:25:47,770
I was like, oh, okay.

6066
06:25:51,930 --> 06:25:54,030
So, you know, I get...

6067
06:25:54,030 --> 06:25:54,110
Oh?

6068
06:25:57,780 --> 06:26:02,150
I guess... I guess if you... I guess that's how you kind of know.

6069
06:26:02,630 --> 06:26:05,310
It's like a little inside secret, I guess.

6070
06:26:13,200 --> 06:26:13,740
Thanks.

6071
06:26:21,160 --> 06:26:22,740
That's why you ask for one from everyone.

6072
06:26:22,960 --> 06:26:24,640
I was thinking that too.

6073
06:26:24,700 --> 06:26:28,020
I was like, don't... Don't post award shows.

6074
06:26:28,020 --> 06:26:34,020
Just ask everybody for one to avoid that kind of like...

6075
06:26:35,440 --> 06:26:38,820
That kind of, oh see, yeah, we haven't been here at all.

6076
06:26:39,560 --> 06:26:40,940
That kind of situation.

6077
06:26:42,560 --> 06:26:43,820
But wait, or have we?

6078
06:26:43,920 --> 06:26:44,980
Oh, we took the tunnels.

6079
06:26:46,660 --> 06:26:48,300
No, we have not been here.

6080
06:26:50,460 --> 06:26:52,460
ASMR, wind sound.

6081
06:27:00,730 --> 06:27:02,450
Tent on the other side for a quest.

6082
06:27:03,070 --> 06:27:03,930
Other side.

6083
06:27:04,450 --> 06:27:05,230
Like over there?

6084
06:27:05,870 --> 06:27:06,530
That other side?

6085
06:27:07,290 --> 06:27:08,070
That other side?

6086
06:27:09,090 --> 06:27:09,810
What's up here?

6087
06:27:11,310 --> 06:27:13,890
I really feel like I'm in Egypt.

6088
06:27:15,930 --> 06:27:21,850
The only thing about this game is I know there's fast travel, but it like feels so long.

6089
06:27:21,930 --> 06:27:25,930
I wish there was like... I wish I could like ride a camel or a horse or something to get around.

6090
06:27:31,360 --> 06:27:33,260
Takes so long to get anywhere.

6091
06:27:33,260 --> 06:27:35,580
Am I just walking?

6092
06:27:37,200 --> 06:27:38,160
I miss D-horse.

6093
06:27:38,280 --> 06:27:40,440
Yeah, we need a D-horse.

6094
06:27:42,220 --> 06:27:43,760
Do you ever go to Egypt for real?

6095
06:27:43,840 --> 06:27:44,640
I would love to.

6096
06:27:50,350 --> 06:27:50,910
But...

6097
06:27:51,610 --> 06:27:53,230
It's a little scary.

6098
06:27:54,470 --> 06:27:56,970
It's a little scary right now.

6099
06:27:59,630 --> 06:28:01,130
In D-horse.

6100
06:28:02,970 --> 06:28:03,850
Comic book.

6101
06:28:06,590 --> 06:28:08,270
Horror tales number two.

6102
06:28:08,890 --> 06:28:09,270
Oh yeah.

6103
06:28:09,510 --> 06:28:10,390
Oh, is that a djinn?

6104
06:28:13,170 --> 06:28:15,290
Oh yeah, Professor Grobbin and the Desert Djinn.

6105
06:28:16,950 --> 06:28:17,730
I know.

6106
06:28:21,030 --> 06:28:22,530
I'm also gonna rob you guys.

6107
06:28:24,430 --> 06:28:25,630
Can I fast travel?

6108
06:28:27,410 --> 06:28:31,830
Yeah, I would want to do more exploring if I could get around more quickly.

6109
06:28:33,190 --> 06:28:37,190
Otherwise like... I know you can run, but I run out of stamina so fast.

6110
06:28:39,270 --> 06:28:41,730
I run out of stamina so easily.

6111
06:28:44,270 --> 06:28:46,590
And I want to explore, but I'm like...

6112
06:28:54,310 --> 06:28:57,550
That's my... Probably my main complaint with the game so far.

6113
06:29:02,800 --> 06:29:05,300
I should get out of here.

6114
06:29:06,700 --> 06:29:11,820
I'm in trouble.

6115
06:29:23,500 --> 06:29:25,160
Punch him!

6116
06:29:54,160 --> 06:29:55,100
Let's leave.

6117
06:30:00,460 --> 06:30:01,580
Let's go.

6118
06:30:10,520 --> 06:30:12,440
Okay, I'm gonna confirm his identity.

6119
06:30:15,180 --> 06:30:17,660
This is a whole side quest area anyway?

6120
06:30:17,880 --> 06:30:18,060
Okay.

6121
06:30:19,760 --> 06:30:20,780
Yeah, I think we're good.

6122
06:30:25,280 --> 06:30:27,140
Everybody is always sneezing.

6123
06:30:27,280 --> 06:30:28,960
I'm worried about these guys.

6124
06:30:30,600 --> 06:30:34,200
About this whole universe, this whole world.

6125
06:30:34,680 --> 06:30:35,940
Why is everybody so sick?

6126
06:30:38,880 --> 06:30:39,640
Why?

6127
06:30:46,500 --> 06:30:49,300
Blue eyed person meme, real.

6128
06:30:49,840 --> 06:30:51,000
Jumbo Lasso.

6129
06:30:52,260 --> 06:30:54,900
Heavyweight enemies can be whip pulled into a grab?

6130
06:30:58,580 --> 06:30:59,540
Yeah, I will.

6131
06:30:59,760 --> 06:31:01,100
And I'm gonna learn it right now.

6132
06:31:02,980 --> 06:31:03,740
That sounds awesome.

6133
06:31:04,580 --> 06:31:04,840
Books.

6134
06:31:06,100 --> 06:31:07,000
It's not exploration.

6135
06:31:07,200 --> 06:31:08,640
No, that's the Giza relics.

6136
06:31:12,940 --> 06:31:13,820
Jumbo Lasso.

6137
06:31:16,100 --> 06:31:17,580
I have plenty of points.

6138
06:31:17,760 --> 06:31:19,420
I have 1600 now.

6139
06:31:20,140 --> 06:31:21,420
I have so many points.

6140
06:31:21,520 --> 06:31:22,900
I feel like I'm not...

6141
06:31:22,900 --> 06:31:27,900
I feel like I'm exploring a lot, but...

6142
06:31:28,860 --> 06:31:31,560
I'm getting more points than I get of books.

6143
06:31:36,340 --> 06:31:38,520
I feel like I explore a lot though.

6144
06:31:39,760 --> 06:31:43,900
Maybe not optimized exploration, but...

6145
06:31:46,280 --> 06:31:47,560
Okay, I'm gonna leave.

6146
06:31:48,580 --> 06:31:50,260
I guess I'll walk home in the desert.

6147
06:31:56,460 --> 06:31:57,660
Riches flowing.

6148
06:32:00,600 --> 06:32:02,140
Where are we?

6149
06:32:02,500 --> 06:32:03,360
What's over here?

6150
06:32:04,820 --> 06:32:06,000
I just wanna look around.

6151
06:32:06,080 --> 06:32:09,300
Oh, this is the meteorological area, isn't it?

6152
06:32:09,780 --> 06:32:10,280
Right here.

6153
06:32:15,250 --> 06:32:16,370
Weather station.

6154
06:32:18,930 --> 06:32:19,530
What?

6155
06:32:19,710 --> 06:32:21,190
It's a perfect...

6156
06:32:21,190 --> 06:32:21,630
There.

6157
06:32:23,650 --> 06:32:24,730
Hello.

6158
06:32:28,610 --> 06:32:29,810
Excuse me.

6159
06:32:32,620 --> 06:32:33,940
What's this?

6160
06:32:34,420 --> 06:32:35,640
Radio frequency.

6161
06:32:38,220 --> 06:32:38,400
What do you mean?

6162
06:32:40,480 --> 06:32:41,080
Are you okay?

6163
06:32:41,480 --> 06:32:41,940
What's wrong?

6164
06:32:45,540 --> 06:32:47,940
Take the money.

6165
06:32:50,000 --> 06:32:50,900
Mystery note.

6166
06:32:53,000 --> 06:32:54,300
Different types of clouds?

6167
06:32:55,760 --> 06:32:56,280
Cute.

6168
06:32:56,720 --> 06:32:57,320
And handwriting.

6169
06:33:01,100 --> 06:33:04,060
I don't know if you know, but you can push enemies over ledges with right stick.

6170
06:33:04,320 --> 06:33:05,260
And it's my favorite take down.

6171
06:33:05,300 --> 06:33:05,780
Really?

6172
06:33:06,480 --> 06:33:07,880
I didn't know that.

6173
06:33:09,800 --> 06:33:10,720
Mystery note.

6174
06:33:14,050 --> 06:33:14,570
Okay.

6175
06:33:15,510 --> 06:33:16,470
New mystery.

6176
06:33:17,190 --> 06:33:18,130
Cloud Atlas.

6177
06:33:18,410 --> 06:33:20,730
Okay, so this seems like a...

6178
06:33:23,890 --> 06:33:24,330
Hello.

6179
06:33:26,030 --> 06:33:27,010
Wait, hold on.

6180
06:33:27,590 --> 06:33:28,710
What is Cloud Atlas?

6181
06:33:30,550 --> 06:33:31,770
Oh, it's just like a...

6182
06:33:36,610 --> 06:33:41,510
So I just figured it out and then I probably can open this.

6183
06:33:42,030 --> 06:33:42,550
I imagine.

6184
06:33:43,470 --> 06:33:44,550
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

6185
06:33:45,290 --> 06:33:46,630
Alright, let's figure this out.

6186
06:33:46,690 --> 06:33:47,650
Let's figure this out, guys.

6187
06:33:47,770 --> 06:33:48,590
Let's figure this out.

6188
06:33:49,710 --> 06:33:51,070
Not that bad!

6189
06:33:53,280 --> 06:33:54,820
Okay, little chest quest.

6190
06:33:54,900 --> 06:33:55,660
Yeah, exactly.

6191
06:33:56,280 --> 06:33:58,780
We can get some goods and stuff in here.

6192
06:34:01,060 --> 06:34:02,940
Okay, inspect.

6193
06:34:04,800 --> 06:34:05,620
So...

6194
06:34:05,620 --> 06:34:07,240
Clear skies...

6195
06:34:10,200 --> 06:34:11,020
And

6196
06:34:15,940 --> 06:34:16,760
Cirrus...

6197
06:34:16,760 --> 06:34:17,440
Okay.

6198
06:34:18,800 --> 06:34:19,140
Call?

6199
06:34:20,800 --> 06:34:21,620
Call?

6200
06:34:22,080 --> 06:34:22,900
Wait, I'm confused.

6201
06:34:29,510 --> 06:34:30,170
1310.

6202
06:34:31,550 --> 06:34:32,890
Are these dates?

6203
06:34:33,910 --> 06:34:38,230
Like, October 13th, October... No, that wouldn't make sense.

6204
06:34:48,890 --> 06:34:50,250
Learn your clouds.

6205
06:34:50,430 --> 06:34:53,290
I know, I know, I know Cumulonimbus.

6206
06:34:53,350 --> 06:34:55,270
I know Cirrus.

6207
06:34:55,910 --> 06:34:57,470
I know...

6208
06:34:58,390 --> 06:34:59,430
I know...

6209
06:34:59,430 --> 06:35:03,690
I know Cumulonimbus because they're my favorite clouds because they're summer clouds!

6210
06:35:05,430 --> 06:35:07,210
I know Cirrus Stratus clouds.

6211
06:35:07,470 --> 06:35:08,570
I know Stratus clouds.

6212
06:35:09,250 --> 06:35:11,510
I don't know Nimbo Stratus clouds.

6213
06:35:12,170 --> 06:35:15,170
I don't know Stratoculimbus clouds.

6214
06:35:16,370 --> 06:35:18,030
I know clouds!

6215
06:35:23,710 --> 06:35:25,890
I don't understand this though.

6216
06:35:36,170 --> 06:35:37,710
I don't understand this at all.

6217
06:35:37,830 --> 06:35:39,690
Maybe I should come back here as a tourist?

6218
06:35:44,140 --> 06:35:45,220
No, help!

6219
06:35:45,420 --> 06:35:46,560
Dates equals numbers.

6220
06:35:49,620 --> 06:35:53,540
So 10, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...

6221
06:35:54,480 --> 06:35:58,800
And then 15, 16 were clear skies...

6222
06:35:58,800 --> 06:36:01,140
And Cirrus clouds, maybe.

6223
06:36:01,140 --> 06:36:01,740
Or

6224
06:36:05,220 --> 06:36:08,780
is it... Hold on.

6225
06:36:12,680 --> 06:36:13,880
13, 14...

6226
06:36:15,780 --> 06:36:19,780
13, 14, 9, 16...

6227
06:36:25,750 --> 06:36:29,290
Do you have any details on when your waifu cup becomes available from gamer shops?

6228
06:36:29,410 --> 06:36:31,950
I want to pump with my Yoshi.

6229
06:36:33,130 --> 06:36:37,790
We're working on one other thing with the drop, so...

6230
06:36:39,090 --> 06:36:43,130
I think once that becomes finalized, which might be a minute.

6231
06:36:43,590 --> 06:36:48,650
13, 9, 16, 10 is Cirrus Stratus Cirrus...

6232
06:36:48,650 --> 06:36:51,670
Yeah, but what... I'm so confused.

6233
06:36:53,130 --> 06:36:54,570
Cirrus Stratus...

6234
06:36:54,570 --> 06:37:00,910
Cirrus... Oh, okay, Cirrus...

6235
06:37:00,910 --> 06:37:04,070
Stratus 0, 6...

6236
06:37:04,070 --> 06:37:05,470
Oh, I get it!

6237
06:37:05,530 --> 06:37:06,070
I get it!

6238
06:37:06,110 --> 06:37:07,890
Oh, okay, okay, okay...

6239
06:37:08,510 --> 06:37:09,070
Okay,

6240
06:37:12,630 --> 06:37:14,070
so 10, 13...

6241
06:37:16,330 --> 06:37:19,230
Cirrus... Oh, okay, okay, okay...

6242
06:37:20,830 --> 06:37:21,390
9...

6243
06:37:23,670 --> 06:37:24,230
Stratus...

6244
06:37:24,230 --> 06:37:27,070
16, 14, 16, 14...

6245
06:37:30,210 --> 06:37:30,770
16...

6246
06:37:30,770 --> 06:37:33,770
Clear skies... Oh, no, sorry, Cirrus...

6247
06:37:34,670 --> 06:37:35,970
Oh, God, I can't remember these.

6248
06:37:37,610 --> 06:37:38,750
It's not here...

6249
06:37:39,510 --> 06:37:43,770
Cirrus Stratus Cirrus Cumulonimbus, okay...

6250
06:37:46,710 --> 06:37:50,330
So, Cirrus 0, Stratus 6...

6251
06:37:53,010 --> 06:37:54,090
Cirrus 0...

6252
06:37:55,430 --> 06:37:57,050
9... 0, 6, 0, 9!

6253
06:38:02,370 --> 06:38:03,370
Oh, hey!

6254
06:38:11,730 --> 06:38:13,270
I need to open it!

6255
06:38:14,790 --> 06:38:16,310
I need to open it, sorry!

6256
06:38:29,070 --> 06:38:29,830
Oh, it worked!

6257
06:38:34,530 --> 06:38:35,790
He was gonna get me anyway.

6258
06:38:36,510 --> 06:38:37,010
0...

6259
06:38:40,210 --> 06:38:41,210
6, 0...

6260
06:38:43,330 --> 06:38:43,810
Yippee!

6261
06:38:43,950 --> 06:38:44,730
Yeah, I am!

6262
06:38:48,150 --> 06:38:50,670
Oh, we got the locations of the medicines!

6263
06:38:54,530 --> 06:38:55,010
Cool.

6264
06:38:56,510 --> 06:38:58,630
Oh, I'm gonna eat a bread.

6265
06:39:00,910 --> 06:39:02,170
And I'm gonna take your cookie.

6266
06:39:03,590 --> 06:39:04,070
Nice.

6267
06:39:04,610 --> 06:39:05,250
Anything in here?

6268
06:39:05,750 --> 06:39:06,110
Nothing?

6269
06:39:06,110 --> 06:39:06,190
Nothing?

6270
06:39:09,050 --> 06:39:09,590
Wow!

6271
06:39:10,030 --> 06:39:10,490
Wow!

6272
06:39:10,710 --> 06:39:12,370
They got the biggest toilet paper ever!

6273
06:39:14,210 --> 06:39:16,170
Pee pee smell...

6274
06:39:16,170 --> 06:39:16,450
Okay.

6275
06:39:20,080 --> 06:39:21,180
Time to go home.

6276
06:39:24,200 --> 06:39:26,300
I do wanna go buy some books.

6277
06:39:26,840 --> 06:39:28,360
I wish I could fast travel.

6278
06:39:29,400 --> 06:39:30,800
I wish I could fast travel.

6279
06:39:31,080 --> 06:39:31,720
I'm just gonna run.

6280
06:39:32,360 --> 06:39:33,140
I'm just gonna run.

6281
06:39:35,020 --> 06:39:36,140
The city is right there.

6282
06:39:42,600 --> 06:39:43,940
Don't stop running, Indy!

6283
06:39:44,180 --> 06:39:45,040
Don't stop running!

6284
06:39:46,320 --> 06:39:48,420
Hit like that from Minto would send me to...

6285
06:39:50,440 --> 06:39:51,560
Hey now, buddy.

6286
06:39:52,800 --> 06:39:54,100
Have some dignity.

6287
06:39:56,440 --> 06:39:57,100
Damn it.

6288
06:39:58,620 --> 06:39:59,240
I'm running.

6289
06:40:00,560 --> 06:40:01,520
I'm running away.

6290
06:40:02,440 --> 06:40:03,680
You don't have to be so curious.

6291
06:40:07,920 --> 06:40:09,440
Indiana Jones, Cookie Thief.

6292
06:40:09,520 --> 06:40:10,500
It does feel like that.

6293
06:40:10,780 --> 06:40:12,220
It truly does feel like that.

6294
06:40:12,920 --> 06:40:15,660
Hey, is this the basket that one person was looking for?

6295
06:40:16,880 --> 06:40:17,360
No.

6296
06:40:17,640 --> 06:40:19,080
She's like, that's my basket.

6297
06:40:22,260 --> 06:40:23,740
Never had in this fandom.

6298
06:40:25,900 --> 06:40:26,380
Fair.

6299
06:40:28,020 --> 06:40:28,500
Minky!

6300
06:40:31,120 --> 06:40:32,280
Is that a dinosaur?

6301
06:40:33,620 --> 06:40:34,940
Oh, I thought it was a... Okay.

6302
06:40:35,400 --> 06:40:37,160
I thought it was a Stegosaurus!

6303
06:40:37,920 --> 06:40:40,420
From far away, I thought it was a Stegosaurus!

6304
06:40:42,380 --> 06:40:43,140
What's that?

6305
06:40:47,760 --> 06:40:48,240
No.

6306
06:40:49,880 --> 06:40:51,140
These are notes.

6307
06:40:52,060 --> 06:40:52,820
These are mysteries.

6308
06:40:53,300 --> 06:40:53,960
These are books.

6309
06:40:55,400 --> 06:40:57,560
I thought these were the Moxies!

6310
06:40:57,820 --> 06:40:59,220
Oh, the Moxie is at...

6311
06:41:02,420 --> 06:41:04,020
Moxie is with the medicine man.

6312
06:41:07,870 --> 06:41:09,550
I thought it was a Stegosaurus.

6313
06:41:09,790 --> 06:41:10,790
You guys see it too, right?

6314
06:41:12,130 --> 06:41:13,610
You guys saw it too?

6315
06:41:15,110 --> 06:41:16,950
So now we've been to everywhere, right?

6316
06:41:18,390 --> 06:41:19,710
We haven't.

6317
06:41:20,770 --> 06:41:21,350
Workers area.

6318
06:41:22,170 --> 06:41:22,430
What?

6319
06:41:25,780 --> 06:41:27,420
How have I not been to everywhere?

6320
06:41:36,260 --> 06:41:37,280
I'm going in.

6321
06:41:40,480 --> 06:41:41,400
Excuse me.

6322
06:41:41,800 --> 06:41:42,180
Hello.

6323
06:41:42,440 --> 06:41:43,020
Hello.

6324
06:41:46,670 --> 06:41:47,350
Hello.

6325
06:41:51,030 --> 06:41:52,090
Don't mind me.

6326
06:41:57,480 --> 06:41:57,880
Nice.

6327
06:41:58,440 --> 06:41:59,240
Quick grab.

6328
06:41:59,740 --> 06:42:00,300
What's this?

6329
06:42:00,460 --> 06:42:00,900
A letter.

6330
06:42:02,780 --> 06:42:03,440
What is it?

6331
06:42:03,620 --> 06:42:04,160
Mayor's letter?

6332
06:42:06,440 --> 06:42:12,100
I know that you hate the man's guts as much as I do, but I feel like we have to do something about it soon.

6333
06:42:12,520 --> 06:42:18,700
Vos has been pushing my men to work harder and harder while being deliberately vague about what it is we are working towards.

6334
06:42:19,040 --> 06:42:23,680
If a man bores him, Vos will make a game of dissecting his psychology and breaking him.

6335
06:42:23,680 --> 06:42:29,940
Just last week, two otherwise sane men fled into the desert without water after a private conversation with Vos.

6336
06:42:30,280 --> 06:42:33,360
I know he has powerful connections, but something has to be done.

6337
06:42:34,380 --> 06:42:34,720
Mayor.

6338
06:42:41,060 --> 06:42:42,540
Who's looking at me?

6339
06:42:44,240 --> 06:42:46,320
Stop checking me out, you freak.

6340
06:42:49,580 --> 06:42:50,460
Oh Kendra!

6341
06:42:50,620 --> 06:42:52,340
Thank you for the raid!

6342
06:42:52,500 --> 06:42:53,000
Hello, hello.

6343
06:42:53,840 --> 06:42:54,580
Hello everybody.

6344
06:42:55,660 --> 06:42:56,440
Hello, hello, hello.

6345
06:42:57,700 --> 06:42:58,580
Welcome in.

6346
06:42:58,700 --> 06:43:00,760
Oh see, we need to peel the buses open.

6347
06:43:06,860 --> 06:43:07,500
What's this?

6348
06:43:09,660 --> 06:43:10,100
Haunting!

6349
06:43:12,200 --> 06:43:16,680
I have heard reports that many of the soldiers refused to enter the tomb west of the workers' camp.

6350
06:43:16,960 --> 06:43:19,600
Rumors say that it's cursed, that it is haunted by ghosts.

6351
06:43:20,000 --> 06:43:23,620
Apparently some of them can even hear whispers at night coming from the entrance.

6352
06:43:24,000 --> 06:43:27,760
I've had the tomb entrance sealed for now, but we must do something to improve the men's morale.

6353
06:43:28,080 --> 06:43:29,680
Maybe a cinema showing would cheer them up.

6354
06:43:43,500 --> 06:43:45,640
The tomb entrance which has been sealed.

6355
06:43:47,920 --> 06:43:50,580
Oh, can you...

6356
06:43:50,580 --> 06:43:54,200
Do you think if I break this open while they are here, they will get upset?

6357
06:43:59,430 --> 06:44:00,770
Will they get mad if I do that?

6358
06:44:04,730 --> 06:44:05,830
Sorry, I was just yawning.

6359
06:44:07,910 --> 06:44:08,310
How

6360
06:44:12,940 --> 06:44:13,440
do I get them?

6361
06:44:13,620 --> 06:44:14,080
Oh, hi.

6362
06:44:34,470 --> 06:44:35,030
Yeah!

6363
06:44:39,250 --> 06:44:41,850
What is he looking at?

6364
06:44:43,570 --> 06:44:45,050
Distract him with a bottle?

6365
06:44:45,510 --> 06:44:46,070
Will it work?

6366
06:45:24,740 --> 06:45:25,820
Stealth 100.

6367
06:45:26,540 --> 06:45:29,440
Come here!

6368
06:45:32,540 --> 06:45:34,700
Did us Wisps come out that arc?

6369
06:45:35,500 --> 06:45:36,240
Okay,

6370
06:45:39,820 --> 06:45:41,080
I don't have anything.

6371
06:45:43,910 --> 06:45:45,570
I don't think I have anything.

6372
06:45:45,910 --> 06:45:46,730
That's cool though.

6373
06:45:52,390 --> 06:45:53,730
It worked!

6374
06:45:54,310 --> 06:45:56,130
It totally worked!

6375
06:45:56,830 --> 06:45:58,330
I'm so stealthy!

6376
06:45:58,330 --> 06:45:58,410
Hey!

6377
06:46:03,030 --> 06:46:07,270
Indy, just take...I wasn't going to take any of them!

6378
06:46:09,850 --> 06:46:13,670
I was just saying, take a break!

6379
06:46:19,990 --> 06:46:21,990
Take a break Indy!

6380
06:46:24,310 --> 06:46:25,110
Don't!

6381
06:46:32,770 --> 06:46:33,730
Increase health...

6382
06:46:33,730 --> 06:46:33,730
Oh,

6383
06:46:37,950 --> 06:46:38,310
good!

6384
06:46:39,890 --> 06:46:43,050
Okay, we can either do more cardio or more health.

6385
06:46:43,190 --> 06:46:46,190
I feel like stamina is probably better than health at this rate.

6386
06:46:52,330 --> 06:46:52,670
I think

6387
06:46:58,930 --> 06:47:03,790
the Djinn is coming for him.

6388
06:47:07,210 --> 06:47:07,630
Mama!

6389
06:47:08,410 --> 06:47:09,370
Thanks for a month!

6390
06:47:10,870 --> 06:47:12,770
Wait, did I not get Moxie one before?

6391
06:47:14,090 --> 06:47:16,610
Oh, but I should either buy one or...

6392
06:47:16,610 --> 06:47:17,130
Okay,

6393
06:47:20,470 --> 06:47:20,770
shut up.

6394
06:47:20,830 --> 06:47:21,810
I'm trying to make a decision.

6395
06:47:23,650 --> 06:47:24,930
One costs less.

6396
06:47:25,930 --> 06:47:27,030
Yeah, I guess that's true.

6397
06:47:27,370 --> 06:47:28,830
I don't think I bought the other one.

6398
06:47:28,830 --> 06:47:32,130
Yeah, we got HP last time.

6399
06:47:32,210 --> 06:47:32,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

6400
06:47:34,370 --> 06:47:34,850
Moxie.

6401
06:47:39,570 --> 06:47:40,650
You know what?

6402
06:47:40,670 --> 06:47:41,730
I'm just going to get all of them.

6403
06:47:42,770 --> 06:47:43,510
What have I not?

6404
06:47:45,230 --> 06:47:46,310
Splinter Smash?

6405
06:47:46,430 --> 06:47:48,890
I haven't unlocked that one.

6406
06:47:51,770 --> 06:47:53,950
Okay, I've unlocked everything that I can now.

6407
06:47:55,770 --> 06:47:56,250
Cool.

6408
06:47:56,250 --> 06:47:57,570
I don't know.

6409
06:47:57,890 --> 06:47:59,710
Should we do the haunted one, you guys?

6410
06:47:59,870 --> 06:48:02,970
I feel like we have to.

6411
06:48:03,610 --> 06:48:06,030
I want to do the haunted one and then we can go to the Sphinx.

6412
06:48:12,630 --> 06:48:13,610
It's over here.

6413
06:48:13,690 --> 06:48:14,450
It's right here.

6414
06:48:15,490 --> 06:48:16,090
Easy peasy.

6415
06:48:18,290 --> 06:48:19,250
I'm scared!

6416
06:48:20,490 --> 06:48:21,890
I can hear the whispers.

6417
06:48:22,570 --> 06:48:23,290
I'm scared!

6418
06:48:27,150 --> 06:48:28,110
I'm scared.

6419
06:48:30,630 --> 06:48:31,710
Okay, I'll hold your hand.

6420
06:48:31,830 --> 06:48:31,970
Okay.

6421
06:48:32,650 --> 06:48:32,950
Wait.

6422
06:48:36,530 --> 06:48:37,010
What?

6423
06:48:38,050 --> 06:48:38,830
I didn't... No.

6424
06:48:45,820 --> 06:48:47,560
I don't know why they give me this stuff.

6425
06:48:47,620 --> 06:48:48,980
It kind of freaks me out.

6426
06:48:50,020 --> 06:48:51,120
Am I going to die in here?

6427
06:49:10,840 --> 06:49:12,380
Why is it so scary?

6428
06:49:13,580 --> 06:49:14,340
Oh my god.

6429
06:49:15,980 --> 06:49:16,800
No way.

6430
06:49:16,800 --> 06:49:16,880
Okay.

6431
06:49:26,890 --> 06:49:28,630
I hope whoever reads this is a friend.

6432
06:49:29,070 --> 06:49:30,970
Know that I am a spy of N.

6433
06:49:31,770 --> 06:49:34,270
The Nachos must not have this artifact.

6434
06:49:34,690 --> 06:49:35,990
I could not smuggle it out of here.

6435
06:49:36,110 --> 06:49:36,830
It seems important.

6436
06:49:37,210 --> 06:49:37,850
They are on to me.

6437
06:49:38,230 --> 06:49:39,850
I feel them watching me during the work shift.

6438
06:49:40,090 --> 06:49:40,970
I don't have much time.

6439
06:49:41,250 --> 06:49:44,110
I hope this radio and the haunted sounds will scare them off long enough.

6440
06:49:44,590 --> 06:49:45,850
The Nachos are very stupid.

6441
06:49:46,490 --> 06:49:47,910
So I should buy us some time.

6442
06:49:48,170 --> 06:49:49,730
Maybe they will leave before they find it.

6443
06:49:49,990 --> 06:49:51,070
If god wills it.

6444
06:49:53,510 --> 06:49:56,870
This is exactly what Minto ASMR will sound like.

6445
06:49:59,070 --> 06:50:00,190
No way.

6446
06:50:00,650 --> 06:50:01,830
It was just a recording?

6447
06:50:03,830 --> 06:50:05,370
Guys, ghosts are real.

6448
06:50:06,890 --> 06:50:08,070
Don't get it twisted.

6449
06:50:09,870 --> 06:50:14,750
I was so excited for some grand adventure in the haunted area.

6450
06:50:14,750 --> 06:50:15,330
No,

6451
06:50:24,040 --> 06:50:24,380
they are not.

6452
06:50:24,480 --> 06:50:25,340
Yes, they are.

6453
06:50:25,440 --> 06:50:26,620
It's literally me.

6454
06:50:31,020 --> 06:50:31,680
Are you okay?

6455
06:50:33,280 --> 06:50:34,680
I don't think he is okay.

6456
06:50:35,860 --> 06:50:37,100
He is not taking it very well.

6457
06:50:41,560 --> 06:50:43,140
Alright, let's... wait, what's over there?

6458
06:50:44,380 --> 06:50:47,500
I want to see what that is and then we will fast travel to the Sphinx.

6459
06:50:53,540 --> 06:50:55,700
Let's see if there is any goodies over here.

6460
06:50:57,020 --> 06:50:57,540
Money?

6461
06:51:01,540 --> 06:51:02,320
A cookie?

6462
06:51:07,220 --> 06:51:07,740
Take.

6463
06:51:08,620 --> 06:51:09,060
Noice.

6464
06:51:09,280 --> 06:51:09,980
Okay, I'll go.

6465
06:51:12,900 --> 06:51:14,880
No, you are a fake ghost.

6466
06:51:14,960 --> 06:51:16,980
I'm not a fake ghost!

6467
06:51:17,940 --> 06:51:19,500
I'm the realest ghost.

6468
06:51:20,380 --> 06:51:21,640
I'm the real ghost.

6469
06:51:21,740 --> 06:51:23,160
I'm the realest real ghost.

6470
06:51:23,240 --> 06:51:24,800
Ask me any sort of ghost question.

6471
06:51:26,840 --> 06:51:28,960
I believe you are a ghost if you haunt me tonight.

6472
06:51:29,020 --> 06:51:30,440
I'm already haunting you right now.

6473
06:51:30,920 --> 06:51:32,420
Technically I'm haunting you tonight.

6474
06:51:36,040 --> 06:51:37,520
Ghosts can't wear hats.

6475
06:51:38,260 --> 06:51:38,760
What?

6476
06:51:39,440 --> 06:51:41,860
How would you even... why would you even think that?

6477
06:51:42,340 --> 06:51:43,900
Ghosts can definitely wear hats.

6478
06:51:47,080 --> 06:51:48,300
Where is the... oh here it is.

6479
06:51:50,380 --> 06:51:51,380
Sphinx time!

6480
06:51:57,480 --> 06:51:57,980
Sphinx.

6481
06:52:01,800 --> 06:52:02,880
3 plus 3.

6482
06:52:06,700 --> 06:52:07,440
That's it.

6483
06:52:07,600 --> 06:52:08,060
That's it.

6484
06:52:10,120 --> 06:52:11,580
Oh I have to go to this part.

6485
06:52:12,120 --> 06:52:14,320
I was gonna say, am I going back inside?

6486
06:52:15,560 --> 06:52:16,660
Doesn't seem to be the case.

6487
06:52:19,460 --> 06:52:20,520
Yu Yuko wears a hat.

6488
06:52:20,600 --> 06:52:21,560
That's what I'm saying!

6489
06:52:24,080 --> 06:52:25,220
I'm taking another picture?

6490
06:52:27,640 --> 06:52:28,820
Oh yeah that's right.

6491
06:52:29,160 --> 06:52:33,220
We're gonna... we're gonna go investigate the dream stele.

6492
06:52:35,560 --> 06:52:36,180
OK.

6493
06:52:37,080 --> 06:52:37,740
What now?

6494
06:52:38,720 --> 06:52:40,280
Oh, solve the dream stele.

6495
06:52:41,180 --> 06:52:42,040
Find clues.

6496
06:52:42,200 --> 06:52:42,880
0 out of 4.

6497
06:52:43,040 --> 06:52:43,280
OK.

6498
06:52:47,380 --> 06:52:48,440
Guardian symbol.

6499
06:52:50,100 --> 06:52:50,720
Where?

6500
06:52:52,080 --> 06:52:52,700
Where?

6501
06:52:54,180 --> 06:52:54,800
Where?

6502
06:52:55,960 --> 06:52:56,960
Zoom in.

6503
06:52:57,100 --> 06:52:57,400
OK.

6504
06:52:57,600 --> 06:52:57,940
God!

6505
06:53:04,900 --> 06:53:06,260
Right there.

6506
06:53:09,640 --> 06:53:10,920
Oh I see!

6507
06:53:11,120 --> 06:53:13,640
I'm supposed to like find... maybe that?

6508
06:53:14,080 --> 06:53:14,240
There?

6509
06:53:17,040 --> 06:53:17,920
This one?

6510
06:53:22,860 --> 06:53:23,920
And this one?

6511
06:53:28,000 --> 06:53:29,680
This one.

6512
06:53:29,920 --> 06:53:31,120
Great Pyramid.

6513
06:53:33,980 --> 06:53:35,280
Khufu?

6514
06:53:40,940 --> 06:53:42,340
OK.

6515
06:53:45,160 --> 06:53:45,860
Where's my map?

6516
06:53:48,260 --> 06:53:49,740
All the way!

6517
06:53:51,160 --> 06:53:52,580
Over there baby!

6518
06:53:53,760 --> 06:53:54,280
Alright!

6519
06:53:55,220 --> 06:53:58,960
Maybe I should have done this way long ago and then I could have run all the way over there.

6520
06:54:04,560 --> 06:54:06,480
I just realized I can get up here.

6521
06:54:07,120 --> 06:54:07,400
Oops!

6522
06:54:11,180 --> 06:54:12,480
Can I though?

6523
06:54:14,020 --> 06:54:14,840
Come on Indy!

6524
06:54:15,780 --> 06:54:16,240
Indy!

6525
06:54:18,820 --> 06:54:19,600
There we go.

6526
06:54:24,060 --> 06:54:25,980
Did someone notice me?

6527
06:54:26,900 --> 06:54:27,360
No!

6528
06:54:30,480 --> 06:54:31,760
What's up in here?

6529
06:54:34,100 --> 06:54:34,860
Money.

6530
06:54:38,080 --> 06:54:39,740
Let's see if I can hit someone from here.

6531
06:54:47,960 --> 06:54:49,100
I tried.

6532
06:55:05,420 --> 06:55:05,960
Uhm...

6533
06:55:07,460 --> 06:55:08,540
We'll wait.

6534
06:55:09,660 --> 06:55:10,460
We'll wait.

6535
06:55:10,740 --> 06:55:11,900
We'll go down the other way.

6536
06:55:13,120 --> 06:55:14,080
Or I could just run.

6537
06:55:14,260 --> 06:55:14,600
You know what?

6538
06:55:14,620 --> 06:55:15,080
Let's just run.

6539
06:55:17,810 --> 06:55:18,620
Go Indy!

6540
06:55:19,000 --> 06:55:19,700
Go Indy!

6541
06:55:20,120 --> 06:55:20,900
Indy run!

6542
06:55:21,860 --> 06:55:22,680
Indy run!

6543
06:55:28,900 --> 06:55:30,040
Indy get out of there!

6544
06:55:30,580 --> 06:55:30,980
Phew!

6545
06:55:34,040 --> 06:55:37,760
If you ask me, this is a shoe-in for Indy Game of the Year.

6546
06:55:43,550 --> 06:55:43,950
Onwards.

6547
06:55:44,170 --> 06:55:46,550
OK we are going to the base of the pyramid.

6548
06:55:48,650 --> 06:55:50,330
This guy is going to catch us probably.

6549
06:55:50,470 --> 06:55:50,810
OK good.

6550
06:55:51,530 --> 06:55:52,770
I thought he was going to clock us.

6551
06:55:55,390 --> 06:55:56,310
That's a dog!

6552
06:55:56,310 --> 06:55:57,250
Uh-oh.

6553
06:55:59,270 --> 06:56:00,610
The dog won't get us though, right?

6554
06:56:00,910 --> 06:56:01,570
Dog is friend?

6555
06:56:03,310 --> 06:56:05,230
Dog is friend.

6556
06:56:06,630 --> 06:56:07,210
Dog.

6557
06:56:08,790 --> 06:56:10,530
Dog knows stinky smell.

6558
06:56:11,490 --> 06:56:13,310
Oh this guy is...

6559
06:56:14,110 --> 06:56:17,310
I'm trying to do a shortcut but it ended up being weird.

6560
06:56:21,660 --> 06:56:22,240
OK.

6561
06:56:24,820 --> 06:56:26,980
I can probably go around this area.

6562
06:56:26,980 --> 06:56:29,580
So I don't have to go through the camp.

6563
06:56:30,240 --> 06:56:31,260
Wherever I am.

6564
06:56:33,420 --> 06:56:34,940
Camp... what's her name?

6565
06:56:37,640 --> 06:56:38,480
Get it?

6566
06:56:39,040 --> 06:56:40,420
Indy Game!

6567
06:56:43,380 --> 06:56:45,400
Yeah, you can't pet the dog though.

6568
06:56:45,520 --> 06:56:47,940
And it really does influence my score of the game.

6569
06:56:48,280 --> 06:56:49,200
Believe it or not.

6570
06:56:51,060 --> 06:56:54,180
I would receive a much higher score if you could pet the dogs.

6571
06:56:54,180 --> 06:56:58,380
It's great that you can take pictures of the dogs and the cats, but...

6572
06:56:59,720 --> 06:57:00,840
It's like...

6573
06:57:00,840 --> 06:57:01,940
Come on.

6574
06:57:02,120 --> 06:57:02,380
Hello?

6575
06:57:04,340 --> 06:57:05,840
What's wrong with this?

6576
06:57:07,500 --> 06:57:08,620
OK, nevermind.

6577
06:57:11,140 --> 06:57:11,700
Slacker!

6578
06:57:18,420 --> 06:57:19,880
Almost a 7 hour stream.

6579
06:57:20,120 --> 06:57:21,580
I honestly haven't even noticed.

6580
06:57:23,600 --> 06:57:25,520
I'm so into this game.

6581
06:57:27,320 --> 06:57:28,560
I'm so into it.

6582
06:57:28,600 --> 06:57:29,880
I'm so much fun with this game.

6583
06:57:31,020 --> 06:57:32,320
It's so fun.

6584
06:57:37,160 --> 06:57:38,540
Oh, it's a train.

6585
06:57:38,840 --> 06:57:39,940
I thought someone was running after me.

6586
06:57:42,760 --> 06:57:44,000
Am I allowed to be here?

6587
06:57:44,160 --> 06:57:45,280
Yeah, we're fine.

6588
06:57:47,360 --> 06:57:49,080
Is this guy gonna clock me?

6589
06:57:56,980 --> 06:57:57,420
Bless you.

6590
06:58:01,990 --> 06:58:04,590
Oh my gosh, we're almost to the base of the pyramid.

6591
06:58:04,930 --> 06:58:05,610
OK, right over here?

6592
06:58:07,670 --> 06:58:09,630
I haven't been to this area yet.

6593
06:58:10,830 --> 06:58:12,530
Let's see if they have any money I can take.

6594
06:58:17,090 --> 06:58:17,570
Steely!

6595
06:58:17,570 --> 06:58:18,950
I'm about to steely too.

6596
06:58:20,390 --> 06:58:21,550
Oh, nevermind.

6597
06:58:23,450 --> 06:58:24,210
Take that.

6598
06:58:26,770 --> 06:58:27,610
This is it?

6599
06:58:27,730 --> 06:58:27,870
OK.

6600
06:58:28,110 --> 06:58:29,210
Yeah, this area.

6601
06:58:30,050 --> 06:58:31,290
It's our steely guy.

6602
06:58:35,410 --> 06:58:35,930
Steely...

6603
06:58:35,930 --> 06:58:37,990
Oh see, now this looks suspicious.

6604
06:58:42,650 --> 06:58:43,690
That's the symbol!

6605
06:58:49,990 --> 06:58:51,090
There it is.

6606
06:58:51,530 --> 06:58:52,270
Glad I took that.

6607
06:58:54,310 --> 06:58:55,030
Yeah!

6608
06:58:57,090 --> 06:58:59,930
How did nobody notice this?

6609
06:59:00,770 --> 06:59:05,010
That's how I always feel about the other movies too.

6610
06:59:05,090 --> 06:59:07,050
I'm like, how did anybody not notice this?

6611
06:59:08,530 --> 06:59:11,070
I think I need a highlighter.

6612
06:59:14,160 --> 06:59:17,240
That doesn't look breakable.

6613
06:59:17,500 --> 06:59:17,620
No.

6614
06:59:20,140 --> 06:59:22,240
People just don't go smashing walls?

6615
06:59:23,020 --> 06:59:23,700
I guess not.

6616
06:59:26,820 --> 06:59:27,540
What is it?

6617
06:59:29,840 --> 06:59:30,880
How can you tell?

6618
06:59:31,160 --> 06:59:32,160
They all look the same.

6619
06:59:38,140 --> 06:59:40,460
Chamber of resonance.

6620
06:59:51,240 --> 06:59:53,560
Like a resonance chamber.

6621
07:00:01,680 --> 07:00:03,300
Oh boy, am I going to have to...

6622
07:00:03,300 --> 07:00:08,340
Am I going to have to solve this language?

6623
07:00:15,880 --> 07:00:17,980
Hold on, answer your question after J.

6624
07:00:18,080 --> 07:00:18,380
Thank you!

6625
07:00:21,060 --> 07:00:22,020
That means?

6626
07:00:41,630 --> 07:00:42,330
Brainblast!

6627
07:01:06,110 --> 07:01:08,910
Oh my god, he's getting crazy eyes.

6628
07:01:14,790 --> 07:01:19,150
I was wondering if it was ok to use some of your karaoke songs...

6629
07:01:19,150 --> 07:01:21,290
into a custom vinyl record as a Christmas gift.

6630
07:01:21,610 --> 07:01:22,770
Oh my god, of course J!

6631
07:01:23,270 --> 07:01:24,330
That sounds insane!

6632
07:01:27,590 --> 07:01:28,350
Thank you!

6633
07:01:28,550 --> 07:01:29,990
I don't think my...

6634
07:01:29,990 --> 07:01:35,070
I don't think my karaoke's are high quality enough to sound like...

6635
07:01:35,870 --> 07:01:36,490
Official...

6636
07:01:38,450 --> 07:01:43,070
Official record, official recording is all...

6637
07:01:52,490 --> 07:01:56,350
Ok Yeah?

6638
07:01:58,190 --> 07:02:00,290
Do I do it in a certain order?

6639
07:02:02,550 --> 07:02:04,350
Search for clues 3 out of 6.

6640
07:02:04,350 --> 07:02:05,630
Do I do it?

6641
07:02:05,630 --> 07:02:06,910
Oh, do I do it in a certain order?

6642
07:02:08,870 --> 07:02:10,150
Ok, ok, maybe.

6643
07:02:16,110 --> 07:02:16,610
Maybe?

6644
07:02:20,160 --> 07:02:21,520
The game begs to differ.

6645
07:02:22,680 --> 07:02:23,820
Wait, what am I wrong about?

6646
07:02:26,280 --> 07:02:27,600
I already took this picture.

6647
07:02:28,120 --> 07:02:30,460
Is there anything on here I take a picture of?

6648
07:02:35,510 --> 07:02:36,510
So creepy!

6649
07:02:38,170 --> 07:02:39,130
So creepy.

6650
07:02:39,130 --> 07:02:41,230
How about this guy?

6651
07:02:42,130 --> 07:02:43,010
No hand.

6652
07:03:05,120 --> 07:03:06,640
Don't like that.

6653
07:03:09,890 --> 07:03:11,450
Don't like that.

6654
07:03:12,470 --> 07:03:13,930
That's a little freaky.

6655
07:03:15,890 --> 07:03:18,750
Maybe this is the real haunted...

6656
07:03:25,950 --> 07:03:28,430
This is the real haunted...

6657
07:03:30,370 --> 07:03:31,130
Area.

6658
07:03:33,250 --> 07:03:34,010
Oh!

6659
07:03:34,350 --> 07:03:35,850
That's so nice of them.

6660
07:03:52,960 --> 07:03:59,340
Ok And then we connect this...

6661
07:04:00,160 --> 07:04:00,920
Tablet piece.

6662
07:04:01,920 --> 07:04:03,680
And take a picture.

6663
07:04:05,580 --> 07:04:07,700
And that should be it.

6664
07:04:17,980 --> 07:04:19,180
Ok Ok

6665
07:04:27,460 --> 07:04:28,100
Heed?

6666
07:04:28,840 --> 07:04:29,480
Protect?

6667
07:04:30,660 --> 07:04:31,200
Oath?

6668
07:04:31,820 --> 07:04:32,660
The Lord's?

6669
07:04:32,680 --> 07:04:33,200
Heed?

6670
07:04:34,380 --> 07:04:35,500
Maybe protect?

6671
07:04:39,720 --> 07:04:41,060
Oh, ok, wait.

6672
07:04:42,000 --> 07:04:44,980
I was gonna say protect the secret in the name of the Lord.

6673
07:04:45,140 --> 07:04:47,620
Well, maybe it's the Lord.

6674
07:04:49,300 --> 07:04:49,940
Heed?

6675
07:05:03,030 --> 07:05:04,870
The Lord's?

6676
07:05:12,530 --> 07:05:13,450
Oath.

6677
07:05:17,570 --> 07:05:19,550
Heed the Lord's Oath.

6678
07:05:24,250 --> 07:05:24,890
So Heed?

6679
07:05:25,770 --> 07:05:26,590
The Lord's?

6680
07:05:27,150 --> 07:05:27,630
Oath?

6681
07:05:32,100 --> 07:05:34,500
I don't know of the name where to put that though.

6682
07:05:45,450 --> 07:05:48,910
Protect the secret...Oh protect the secret of the name!

6683
07:05:54,990 --> 07:05:57,210
Protect...the secret...of the name.

6684
07:06:02,670 --> 07:06:04,270
Oh no!

6685
07:06:17,100 --> 07:06:19,540
Nice Good job!

6686
07:06:19,620 --> 07:06:20,520
We did it guys!

6687
07:06:33,080 --> 07:06:35,240
That was...that was that guy!

6688
07:06:39,960 --> 07:06:40,800
Oh gosh!

6689
07:06:41,380 --> 07:06:42,400
That was the giant!

6690
07:06:43,620 --> 07:06:44,040
Paragon!

6691
07:06:44,220 --> 07:06:44,520
Paragon!

6692
07:06:45,900 --> 07:06:47,580
Guys, we play some freaky games.

6693
07:06:47,940 --> 07:06:49,060
Underground cave system.

6694
07:06:50,580 --> 07:06:51,620
Ancient cave maps.

6695
07:06:51,740 --> 07:06:53,660
Love that we have that on hand with us.

6696
07:07:08,630 --> 07:07:10,810
Can I still...oh no, ok.

6697
07:07:12,670 --> 07:07:14,990
That's actually a little dangerous maybe.

6698
07:07:17,370 --> 07:07:18,090
Hey!

6699
07:07:20,690 --> 07:07:22,830
That was such a clean swing.

6700
07:07:32,720 --> 07:07:36,540
How did he learn this language so fast?

6701
07:07:36,660 --> 07:07:37,620
It's kind of insane.

6702
07:07:39,240 --> 07:07:45,080
Indiana Jones How are you brained the way that you are?

6703
07:07:53,260 --> 07:07:55,300
Oh he's reading the hieroglyphics.

6704
07:07:56,080 --> 07:07:57,440
That makes more sense.

6705
07:07:58,420 --> 07:07:59,740
The cave was sealed.

6706
07:08:00,360 --> 07:08:01,900
Were we not supposed to unseal this?

6707
07:08:10,320 --> 07:08:11,960
Did you guys hear that?

6708
07:08:27,680 --> 07:08:28,640
Predator, right?

6709
07:08:29,380 --> 07:08:29,380
Right?

6710
07:08:35,460 --> 07:08:39,660
Under the command of King Khufu, stones rose to the sky.

6711
07:08:40,100 --> 07:08:41,480
A testament to his power.

6712
07:08:42,120 --> 07:08:42,700
The pyramids.

6713
07:08:44,140 --> 07:08:46,900
What a nice gift that my favorite cute ghostmate is streaming on my birthday!

6714
07:08:51,440 --> 07:08:54,120
Thanks for all the laughs and fun this year and congrats on 300k.

6715
07:08:54,400 --> 07:08:55,000
Thank you!

6716
07:08:55,080 --> 07:08:55,580
Happy birthday!

6717
07:08:56,340 --> 07:09:00,920
Happy birthday...sorry how did she know this?

6718
07:09:01,260 --> 07:09:02,200
To you!

6719
07:09:02,700 --> 07:09:05,760
Happy birthday to you!

6720
07:09:06,220 --> 07:09:09,500
Happy birthday dear Pandore!

6721
07:09:11,220 --> 07:09:15,100
Happy birthday to you!

6722
07:09:15,760 --> 07:09:18,820
Happy birthday and thank you!

6723
07:09:19,500 --> 07:09:21,240
I appreciate it.

6724
07:09:24,380 --> 07:09:24,900
Bats!

6725
07:09:26,080 --> 07:09:28,020
I wonder how much longer I have of this game.

6726
07:09:29,280 --> 07:09:30,620
There is definitely whispers.

6727
07:09:31,260 --> 07:09:32,420
There is definitely whispers?

6728
07:09:34,300 --> 07:09:35,340
Alright spy...

6729
07:09:36,000 --> 07:09:38,140
You don't have to pull another prank on us now.

6730
07:09:39,900 --> 07:09:40,240
Raw?

6731
07:09:44,040 --> 07:09:44,920
A lot?

6732
07:09:45,120 --> 07:09:45,900
No way, seriously?

6733
07:09:46,340 --> 07:09:47,920
Still another big area to go?

6734
07:09:48,320 --> 07:09:48,980
Wait, seriously?

6735
07:09:51,000 --> 07:09:53,240
Only halfway through the game?

6736
07:09:53,760 --> 07:09:54,420
No way.

6737
07:09:58,430 --> 07:10:00,030
No way, are you serious?

6738
07:10:00,650 --> 07:10:01,830
I thought...

6739
07:10:02,770 --> 07:10:06,130
When I looked it up, it said it was like 9 hours.

6740
07:10:06,310 --> 07:10:06,950
That's it.

6741
07:10:09,490 --> 07:10:10,710
Oh my god.

6742
07:10:11,930 --> 07:10:13,890
There is like 3 more chapters?

6743
07:10:14,130 --> 07:10:15,730
Ok, we are not finishing it today then.

6744
07:10:16,050 --> 07:10:17,030
Damn, what?

6745
07:10:17,470 --> 07:10:18,530
Oh my god.

6746
07:10:24,450 --> 07:10:26,770
9 hours for speedrun, that must be it.

6747
07:10:27,230 --> 07:10:28,930
Well, it was like the day the game...

6748
07:10:28,930 --> 07:10:32,070
Or not like the day the game came out, but it was...

6749
07:10:32,070 --> 07:10:34,710
Not long after the game came out, so...

6750
07:10:34,710 --> 07:10:39,250
It probably was like skewed to people who...

6751
07:10:39,250 --> 07:10:40,730
Were like speedrunning it.

6752
07:10:41,270 --> 07:10:42,050
But dang.

6753
07:10:46,560 --> 07:10:48,940
Dang, I really felt like we were coming up on the end too.

6754
07:10:53,680 --> 07:10:54,240
Neolithic?

6755
07:10:54,520 --> 07:10:55,540
No, no, this is...

6756
07:10:56,140 --> 07:10:56,800
Even older.

6757
07:10:57,940 --> 07:11:00,600
Tens of thousands of years before the ancient Egyptians.

6758
07:11:08,020 --> 07:11:08,300
Spooky.

6759
07:11:10,420 --> 07:11:11,440
Ancient relic.

6760
07:11:13,860 --> 07:11:16,260
Oh my god, I hate these things.

6761
07:11:16,680 --> 07:11:19,700
They are the most boring looking relics ever.

6762
07:11:20,200 --> 07:11:21,400
They are so stupid.

6763
07:11:22,520 --> 07:11:22,960
You know what?

6764
07:11:22,960 --> 07:11:25,740
I complained earlier about how slow it is to walk around.

6765
07:11:25,740 --> 07:11:27,440
Are those ants?

6766
07:11:29,400 --> 07:11:30,780
What the hell is it?

6767
07:11:32,340 --> 07:11:32,660
What?

6768
07:11:36,020 --> 07:11:37,600
Smash, smash, smash, smash.

6769
07:11:37,680 --> 07:11:38,580
Squish, squish, squish, squish.

6770
07:11:40,260 --> 07:11:41,380
Let's just...

6771
07:11:43,880 --> 07:11:45,120
Three-eyed gate.

6772
07:11:51,760 --> 07:11:53,680
That's a great question.

6773
07:11:53,680 --> 07:11:58,870
With these babies.

6774
07:11:59,970 --> 07:12:01,490
These bad boys.

6775
07:12:03,170 --> 07:12:04,690
So we have this one.

6776
07:12:05,690 --> 07:12:07,470
We got this one.

6777
07:12:07,650 --> 07:12:09,490
Oh, we're missing one.

6778
07:12:12,750 --> 07:12:13,270
Dang.

6779
07:12:16,910 --> 07:12:19,930
I don't think I'll be able to beat it before Japan then.

6780
07:12:20,010 --> 07:12:20,450
No.

6781
07:12:21,910 --> 07:12:22,810
That's okay.

6782
07:12:23,310 --> 07:12:24,030
We'll just come back.

6783
07:12:24,030 --> 07:12:25,950
I'm not gone for so long anyway.

6784
07:12:28,630 --> 07:12:32,030
If I move you upwards...

6785
07:12:33,870 --> 07:12:35,150
Or upwards...

6786
07:12:35,150 --> 07:12:37,030
Or overwards...

6787
07:12:39,110 --> 07:12:39,910
What opens?

6788
07:12:43,850 --> 07:12:44,690
What just opened?

6789
07:12:46,970 --> 07:12:47,930
Nothing opened?

6790
07:12:48,470 --> 07:12:49,110
Anything opened?

6791
07:12:49,210 --> 07:12:49,870
Something moved.

6792
07:12:50,010 --> 07:12:50,890
I definitely heard it.

6793
07:12:55,700 --> 07:12:57,000
You're going back to Japan?

6794
07:12:57,160 --> 07:12:57,480
What for?

6795
07:12:58,280 --> 07:12:58,860
I...

6796
07:13:00,460 --> 07:13:03,780
Oh, it's like rumbling.

6797
07:13:03,980 --> 07:13:05,480
I only knew because my...

6798
07:13:08,120 --> 07:13:09,960
My controller started rumbling.

6799
07:13:10,200 --> 07:13:11,240
I only knew that this changed.

6800
07:13:12,900 --> 07:13:15,020
Oh, it changes to what it is.

6801
07:13:15,120 --> 07:13:16,060
Oh, that's so interesting.

6802
07:13:18,120 --> 07:13:20,680
My favorite idol group is disbanding.

6803
07:13:20,720 --> 07:13:21,300
So sad.

6804
07:13:21,880 --> 07:13:24,140
So I am going to go see them.

6805
07:13:24,480 --> 07:13:25,260
Their final show.

6806
07:13:25,260 --> 07:13:29,260
Oh, okay, so we use these to create...

6807
07:13:29,780 --> 07:13:30,380
So we...

6808
07:13:32,140 --> 07:13:37,260
We use the light to combine the symbols to create...

6809
07:13:37,820 --> 07:13:39,600
What is shown on there.

6810
07:13:39,740 --> 07:13:40,820
I see, okay.

6811
07:13:42,180 --> 07:13:43,220
Oh, neat.

6812
07:13:45,460 --> 07:13:49,260
So like this one will turn into...

6813
07:13:56,700 --> 07:13:57,640
Oh, it opened.

6814
07:13:57,940 --> 07:13:58,320
Perfect.

6815
07:13:59,840 --> 07:14:01,620
Are they going to get into this symbol though?

6816
07:14:03,600 --> 07:14:06,280
Maybe some symbols... Well, that doesn't look like any of the symbols.

6817
07:14:06,360 --> 07:14:08,260
So maybe some symbols are only for...

6818
07:14:10,000 --> 07:14:11,880
For entering areas?

6819
07:14:13,420 --> 07:14:13,960
Perhaps?

6820
07:14:18,180 --> 07:14:21,160
What's crazy in here is there's no skeletons or anything.

6821
07:14:21,840 --> 07:14:23,720
Like it actually feels untouched.

6822
07:14:24,520 --> 07:14:25,560
So scary.

6823
07:14:29,200 --> 07:14:32,720
Oh my god, imagine you moved it and it showed on a person.

6824
07:14:33,760 --> 07:14:35,000
That would be so scary.

6825
07:14:36,000 --> 07:14:37,800
There's like a guy standing in there.

6826
07:14:44,860 --> 07:14:46,320
Like a g-g-g-ghost.

6827
07:14:46,720 --> 07:14:47,940
Oh, it's a weak scoob.

6828
07:14:48,980 --> 07:14:50,400
Like a g-g-g-ghost.

6829
07:14:51,200 --> 07:14:52,900
I don't think I can go in here at all.

6830
07:14:56,150 --> 07:14:57,210
So let's see.

6831
07:15:01,170 --> 07:15:02,050
Like this?

6832
07:15:06,690 --> 07:15:07,150
Plus...

6833
07:15:07,990 --> 07:15:10,010
This ties to this.

6834
07:15:13,890 --> 07:15:14,810
Maybe?

6835
07:15:18,810 --> 07:15:20,410
Did I just open something?

6836
07:15:20,570 --> 07:15:20,970
Oh, I did.

6837
07:15:28,440 --> 07:15:30,080
British Shaggy.

6838
07:15:31,500 --> 07:15:32,420
No.

6839
07:15:39,300 --> 07:15:39,940
No.

6840
07:15:42,340 --> 07:15:43,860
Yeah, we'll have to take it to the other one.

6841
07:15:49,120 --> 07:15:50,640
It's so cool seeing the light.

6842
07:15:51,900 --> 07:15:53,540
I like it.

6843
07:15:55,540 --> 07:15:56,180
Alrighty.

6844
07:16:00,660 --> 07:16:00,960
Perfect!

6845
07:16:04,880 --> 07:16:05,520
OK.

6846
07:16:06,760 --> 07:16:07,720
My bad.

6847
07:16:10,740 --> 07:16:11,460
What's that light?

6848
07:16:13,020 --> 07:16:15,080
Oh, just the day.

6849
07:16:16,000 --> 07:16:16,700
Just the sun.

6850
07:16:20,140 --> 07:16:20,720
So...

6851
07:16:20,720 --> 07:16:22,740
See how it's kind of creating?

6852
07:16:23,340 --> 07:16:25,740
I'm trying to make this one, but...

6853
07:16:26,780 --> 07:16:28,040
Am I missing something?

6854
07:16:30,500 --> 07:16:33,220
It's not quite...

6855
07:16:33,220 --> 07:16:34,760
Oh, I think I need that.

6856
07:16:39,230 --> 07:16:40,550
I think I need this.

6857
07:16:40,550 --> 07:16:41,490
Yeah!

6858
07:16:42,810 --> 07:16:43,430
The X.

6859
07:16:45,210 --> 07:16:45,890
OK.

6860
07:16:46,530 --> 07:16:47,510
That's the first one.

6861
07:16:47,590 --> 07:16:48,570
Now we need this one.

6862
07:16:49,890 --> 07:16:51,350
And...oh, the X too?

6863
07:16:52,090 --> 07:16:52,770
Or...yeah?

6864
07:16:54,850 --> 07:16:55,870
That one?

6865
07:16:56,610 --> 07:16:58,470
Which one has a circle in the middle?

6866
07:16:58,990 --> 07:17:00,890
I think that one...

6867
07:17:00,890 --> 07:17:02,610
And then...the X.

6868
07:17:09,970 --> 07:17:11,550
It sounds so cool.

6869
07:17:12,150 --> 07:17:14,290
Oh my god, this is so Indiana Jones.

6870
07:17:14,290 --> 07:17:15,990
So awesome.

6871
07:17:16,470 --> 07:17:17,430
Yeah!

6872
07:17:21,090 --> 07:17:22,050
Woah!

6873
07:17:23,310 --> 07:17:25,130
Little ants, little...woah!

6874
07:17:25,910 --> 07:17:27,150
Little ants, little ants.

6875
07:17:29,130 --> 07:17:32,590
Mess up your drawing, little ants.

6876
07:17:33,010 --> 07:17:35,290
Alright, last one is...

6877
07:17:38,730 --> 07:17:40,650
Is this...

6878
07:17:41,290 --> 07:17:43,530
Plus this...

6879
07:17:48,340 --> 07:17:49,180
Plus this?

6880
07:17:50,140 --> 07:17:50,660
I think?

6881
07:17:51,820 --> 07:17:52,740
It's magnetic sand.

6882
07:17:52,840 --> 07:17:53,760
No, it's little ants.

6883
07:17:53,920 --> 07:17:54,220
Shut up.

6884
07:17:55,360 --> 07:17:55,600
And

6885
07:18:02,250 --> 07:18:04,010
then...what was the last one I said?

6886
07:18:04,110 --> 07:18:04,550
I don't remember.

6887
07:18:06,650 --> 07:18:07,710
This bottom one, right?

6888
07:18:10,350 --> 07:18:10,770
Woah!

6889
07:18:11,450 --> 07:18:12,150
I'm a genius!

6890
07:18:12,370 --> 07:18:12,950
First try!

6891
07:18:14,130 --> 07:18:16,290
If there's one thing I'm good at, it's patterns!

6892
07:18:18,570 --> 07:18:20,430
I bought a magic wand!

6893
07:18:21,070 --> 07:18:22,830
No way, you bought a Metal Gear Solid.

6894
07:18:22,830 --> 07:18:25,830
You got the MG...wait, you got the Patchy Solid!

6895
07:18:26,110 --> 07:18:26,830
Don't blame me!

6896
07:18:28,330 --> 07:18:29,610
Don't blame me!

6897
07:18:35,000 --> 07:18:35,820
First try, baby.

6898
07:18:44,480 --> 07:18:46,460
Oh, but what's over here?

6899
07:18:48,280 --> 07:18:52,280
I see the gamer paint, but...

6900
07:18:53,500 --> 07:18:53,960
What?

6901
07:18:55,700 --> 07:18:57,320
I hear so many noises.

6902
07:18:58,300 --> 07:18:59,520
Gamer paint, gamer paint.

6903
07:19:03,940 --> 07:19:06,680
I feel like I need to change into an indie outfit.

6904
07:19:07,960 --> 07:19:08,720
Right?

6905
07:19:17,930 --> 07:19:19,310
Ain't you the best?

6906
07:19:29,300 --> 07:19:30,460
I don't know how.

6907
07:19:37,420 --> 07:19:38,840
Holy moly.

6908
07:19:40,960 --> 07:19:43,980
I feel like I gotta be in my adventurous outfit.

6909
07:19:44,760 --> 07:19:47,320
You know?

6910
07:19:48,040 --> 07:19:49,280
For this adventure.

6911
07:19:51,100 --> 07:19:52,920
There's so many noises!

6912
07:19:55,840 --> 07:19:57,540
So many noises.

6913
07:20:05,300 --> 07:20:07,160
Find a way across.

6914
07:20:10,120 --> 07:20:10,760
Wow!

6915
07:20:12,920 --> 07:20:13,560
Wow!

6916
07:20:16,480 --> 07:20:17,360
Oh my god.

6917
07:20:18,220 --> 07:20:22,020
This game turned way more into an adventure than I thought it would become.

6918
07:20:25,320 --> 07:20:25,960
Anything?

6919
07:20:27,560 --> 07:20:29,320
Don't fall, Indie, don't fall!

6920
07:20:30,660 --> 07:20:31,380
Maybe not.

6921
07:20:32,320 --> 07:20:33,580
Minecraft, yeah.

6922
07:20:35,320 --> 07:20:38,320
Jack Black comes out and he goes, I am Steve.

6923
07:20:42,160 --> 07:20:43,720
What about...

6924
07:20:43,720 --> 07:20:46,200
Good job.

6925
07:20:46,780 --> 07:20:48,200
Nice strong ankles.

6926
07:20:57,980 --> 07:20:59,180
What is that?

6927
07:21:00,320 --> 07:21:02,980
Is that a little part that I'm supposed to...

6928
07:21:02,980 --> 07:21:04,560
Wait, there's gamer...

6929
07:21:04,560 --> 07:21:06,420
There's gamer paint.

6930
07:21:07,660 --> 07:21:09,020
Gamer paint, gamer paint!

6931
07:21:24,060 --> 07:21:24,460
Huh?

6932
07:21:27,690 --> 07:21:29,250
Now I know I'm not crazy.

6933
07:21:29,530 --> 07:21:30,770
There are subtitles for it.

6934
07:21:36,680 --> 07:21:38,160
Is that a car horn?

6935
07:21:39,080 --> 07:21:40,260
It scared me.

6936
07:21:40,720 --> 07:21:43,620
I was like, I thought it was a part of the game at first.

6937
07:21:45,400 --> 07:21:46,240
I was like, huh?

6938
07:21:46,620 --> 07:21:48,180
And then the whisper started.

6939
07:21:48,660 --> 07:21:49,400
And I'm like, huh?

6940
07:21:53,720 --> 07:21:55,460
Wait, how do I get over to that one?

6941
07:21:55,620 --> 07:21:56,800
Oh gosh, the light is so bright.

6942
07:21:57,280 --> 07:21:58,580
Indie, Indie, don't fall.

6943
07:21:58,580 --> 07:22:00,740
You know what, actually this works.

6944
07:22:00,860 --> 07:22:02,100
Maybe I did it anyway.

6945
07:22:03,100 --> 07:22:04,260
I made it across!

6946
07:22:16,740 --> 07:22:19,080
Why are there such creepy whispers happening?

6947
07:22:20,180 --> 07:22:22,600
Creepy whispers happening and clicking happening.

6948
07:22:25,540 --> 07:22:26,440
Oh here.

6949
07:22:27,080 --> 07:22:27,740
Dead...

6950
07:22:27,740 --> 07:22:28,560
I

6951
07:22:32,040 --> 07:22:38,540
even mentioned earlier, I was like, there are no skellies.

6952
07:22:40,300 --> 07:22:41,280
Just like us.

6953
07:22:47,100 --> 07:22:48,580
The clicking isn't your controller?

6954
07:22:48,900 --> 07:22:49,100
No.

6955
07:22:50,100 --> 07:22:51,080
No, it's not.

6956
07:22:55,940 --> 07:22:58,040
I like how there are different ways you can go.

6957
07:22:58,720 --> 07:23:03,580
The game doesn't limit you and make you be like, you went the wrong way, you have to turn all the way around.

6958
07:23:05,080 --> 07:23:06,620
What if he just fell in?

6959
07:23:07,100 --> 07:23:08,480
I got it.

6960
07:23:12,690 --> 07:23:16,870
I know I feel like I should bring that, but I also...

6961
07:23:16,870 --> 07:23:17,390
I'm scared.

6962
07:23:23,020 --> 07:23:24,560
I need the light more than that.

6963
07:23:26,520 --> 07:23:27,860
Where are his clothes?

6964
07:23:30,000 --> 07:23:31,360
Back then he didn't need any.

6965
07:23:36,320 --> 07:23:40,680
According to Michael Bay, Transformers built the pyramids, so maybe the car horn is their cause.

6966
07:23:41,760 --> 07:23:46,060
I've been sick, took a nap, I'm not wearing my glasses for a couple of seconds, my brain registered this as Minecraft.

6967
07:23:47,240 --> 07:23:49,640
You're not so far off.

6968
07:23:50,120 --> 07:23:51,220
I hope you feel better, Casey.

6969
07:23:54,500 --> 07:23:55,800
These aren't gonna move, are they?

6970
07:23:58,460 --> 07:23:58,800
Wait.

6971
07:24:03,510 --> 07:24:05,010
I thought I heard other footsteps.

6972
07:24:06,290 --> 07:24:09,570
I thought I heard other footsteps.

6973
07:24:10,090 --> 07:24:11,170
Oh gosh, the game is saving me.

6974
07:24:11,230 --> 07:24:12,110
Cave of Darkness?

6975
07:24:13,290 --> 07:24:14,250
Yeah, I don't like that.

6976
07:24:19,810 --> 07:24:20,370
What?

6977
07:24:26,020 --> 07:24:27,460
Don't like that.

6978
07:24:30,840 --> 07:24:31,400
Creepy.

6979
07:24:35,540 --> 07:24:37,080
This is so creepy.

6980
07:24:37,640 --> 07:24:39,400
If that's gone, I might lose it.

6981
07:24:39,620 --> 07:24:41,120
I might call it, you guys.

6982
07:24:43,160 --> 07:24:44,280
If that...

6983
07:24:44,280 --> 07:24:45,600
Look, there's more bones.

6984
07:24:47,160 --> 07:24:50,280
If whatever that was standing over there wasn't just...

6985
07:24:52,120 --> 07:24:53,280
A statue.

6986
07:24:54,080 --> 07:24:54,760
And moves.

6987
07:24:57,660 --> 07:24:58,480
Oh my god.

6988
07:25:04,040 --> 07:25:06,200
Will something attack me in the darkness?

6989
07:25:06,340 --> 07:25:07,280
Is that why these are here?

6990
07:25:09,560 --> 07:25:11,540
The giant attack in the darkness.

6991
07:25:15,640 --> 07:25:17,100
We learned that.

6992
07:25:18,200 --> 07:25:18,840
All the money.

6993
07:25:25,470 --> 07:25:27,150
Oh okay, it's just a statue.

6994
07:25:27,150 --> 07:25:28,770
Thank god.

6995
07:25:33,570 --> 07:25:36,830
I completed it?

6996
07:25:48,880 --> 07:25:55,940
I don't like this.

6997
07:26:00,200 --> 07:26:02,100
I don't like it.

6998
07:26:15,320 --> 07:26:18,140
They kept saying that the giants would fight in the darkness.

6999
07:26:18,440 --> 07:26:21,400
And I knew that eventually I would have to fight one.

7000
07:26:23,640 --> 07:26:25,460
Oh, but I really don't want to.

7001
07:26:46,630 --> 07:26:47,630
Here he comes.

7002
07:26:49,890 --> 07:26:50,930
I see

7003
07:27:06,220 --> 07:27:11,500
him coming.

7004
07:27:11,720 --> 07:27:12,340
I see him coming.

7005
07:27:16,140 --> 07:27:17,020
Oh god!

7006
07:27:17,200 --> 07:27:17,680
Oh god!

7007
07:27:25,010 --> 07:27:26,690
Why am I...

7008
07:27:39,220 --> 07:27:40,280
At least I got that.

7009
07:27:45,920 --> 07:27:47,220
Oh my god, I can't see him.

7010
07:27:47,440 --> 07:27:47,960
Oh my god!

7011
07:28:15,230 --> 07:28:20,470
Okay, it's not so bad because they give you lots of time to like...

7012
07:28:20,470 --> 07:28:21,190
What's the word?

7013
07:28:23,670 --> 07:28:24,690
Oh, I think he's coming.

7014
07:28:35,680 --> 07:28:36,920
God, I tried to block.

7015
07:28:39,320 --> 07:28:39,800
Oh...

7016
07:28:41,940 --> 07:28:44,940
Yeah, lots of time to like just chill out and be like...

7017
07:28:44,940 --> 07:28:47,100
Oh god, help me.

7018
07:28:49,380 --> 07:28:53,140
I'm trying to stay off the coins, but he throws me onto them sometimes.

7019
07:28:54,620 --> 07:28:57,120
I don't know if this will...

7020
07:29:05,570 --> 07:29:07,870
I don't know if he hears that.

7021
07:29:10,830 --> 07:29:12,070
There we go.

7022
07:29:12,210 --> 07:29:13,810
I see, I just ate.

7023
07:29:37,860 --> 07:29:40,280
I think that's important information.

7024
07:29:42,800 --> 07:29:43,840
Don't say it.

7025
07:29:44,180 --> 07:29:45,360
No, that's the thing.

7026
07:29:45,460 --> 07:29:46,760
He's not supposed to say it.

7027
07:29:49,980 --> 07:29:50,540
Deathrattle?

7028
07:29:50,900 --> 07:29:52,380
We just killed this guy.

7029
07:29:54,280 --> 07:29:55,740
Indy, that's the important thing.

7030
07:29:55,840 --> 07:29:57,540
Don't say it.

7031
07:29:59,040 --> 07:30:01,120
You don't say it.

7032
07:30:11,520 --> 07:30:13,640
Not gun, sorry.

7033
07:30:13,940 --> 07:30:14,540
This.

7034
07:30:16,580 --> 07:30:17,160
Here we go.

7035
07:30:17,740 --> 07:30:18,200
Is it here?

7036
07:30:20,680 --> 07:30:21,940
Sorry guy.

7037
07:30:25,080 --> 07:30:26,180
You're really old.

7038
07:30:28,860 --> 07:30:29,500
This way?

7039
07:30:29,740 --> 07:30:30,160
Onwards?

7040
07:30:36,490 --> 07:30:37,330
What's this?

7041
07:30:39,730 --> 07:30:40,610
Ass up.

7042
07:30:41,210 --> 07:30:42,310
That's not how he died.

7043
07:30:42,410 --> 07:30:45,350
That means Indiana Jones flipped him on his back.

7044
07:30:46,030 --> 07:30:47,910
I guess to get the... No, he got the pendant.

7045
07:30:49,890 --> 07:30:51,010
The buttons on the floor?

7046
07:30:51,210 --> 07:30:52,670
Oh, thank you.

7047
07:30:52,730 --> 07:30:53,470
Oh yeah, that's right.

7048
07:30:53,510 --> 07:30:54,250
We have to...

7049
07:30:56,750 --> 07:30:58,370
We have to step on them, right?

7050
07:30:59,110 --> 07:31:00,090
Where was the other one?

7051
07:31:02,070 --> 07:31:04,870
There's this one, and that one, and then one more, right?

7052
07:31:06,630 --> 07:31:07,470
Where was it?

7053
07:31:08,990 --> 07:31:09,830
Was it over here?

7054
07:31:12,290 --> 07:31:12,690
Here.

7055
07:31:18,630 --> 07:31:19,370
There we go.

7056
07:31:26,370 --> 07:31:27,130
Guardian pendant.

7057
07:31:29,810 --> 07:31:30,310
Alrighty.

7058
07:31:36,060 --> 07:31:37,420
Are we the bad guy?

7059
07:31:37,620 --> 07:31:38,520
We might be.

7060
07:31:40,260 --> 07:31:41,820
But we're not the baddest guys.

7061
07:31:50,980 --> 07:31:52,400
Look at that guy.

7062
07:31:52,520 --> 07:31:54,320
He does not care about you, Indiana Jones.

7063
07:31:54,880 --> 07:31:56,120
He's just a little guy.

7064
07:32:10,000 --> 07:32:13,000
And guess who tailed us the entire time?

7065
07:32:14,000 --> 07:32:18,560
We're gonna be seeing Emerick's face real soon, I bet.

7066
07:32:20,260 --> 07:32:21,760
Where the hell did we come from?

7067
07:32:21,900 --> 07:32:22,500
Oh yeah, that's right.

7068
07:32:22,540 --> 07:32:23,240
We fell down, right?

7069
07:32:29,200 --> 07:32:29,720
Narwhal.

7070
07:32:29,720 --> 07:32:30,600
Damn, Minto.

7071
07:32:31,180 --> 07:32:32,420
She's really a genius.

7072
07:32:34,560 --> 07:32:37,100
Did someone... Did you have a bad trip?

7073
07:32:39,180 --> 07:32:43,980
Should we not take heed to these skellies?

7074
07:32:44,660 --> 07:32:48,300
To these dead guys and why they could have potentially died from a trap?

7075
07:32:49,700 --> 07:32:50,000
Nope.

7076
07:32:50,320 --> 07:32:50,600
Okay.

7077
07:32:57,850 --> 07:32:59,690
This looks suspicious.

7078
07:33:02,570 --> 07:33:05,110
Was this room gonna fill with sand or something?

7079
07:33:05,270 --> 07:33:05,850
Oh god.

7080
07:33:06,810 --> 07:33:08,110
The idol of Ra.

7081
07:33:08,850 --> 07:33:09,870
It was just here.

7082
07:33:10,070 --> 07:33:10,930
Oh my god, it's so bright.

7083
07:33:12,710 --> 07:33:13,810
Here we go.

7084
07:33:15,370 --> 07:33:17,170
This is what everybody is after.

7085
07:33:24,090 --> 07:33:25,930
There it is.

7086
07:33:28,430 --> 07:33:30,590
Indy, pay attention please.

7087
07:33:33,270 --> 07:33:35,130
Indy, the door.

7088
07:33:36,010 --> 07:33:36,810
Indiana Jones!

7089
07:33:37,010 --> 07:33:37,970
Indiana Jones.

7090
07:33:43,360 --> 07:33:46,560
Some of the skeletons are where other players died during the game.

7091
07:33:46,780 --> 07:33:48,260
No, they're not.

7092
07:33:50,220 --> 07:33:51,060
He got it.

7093
07:33:51,520 --> 07:33:53,400
The piece to the great circle.

7094
07:34:10,680 --> 07:34:11,880
Don't make me do it.

7095
07:34:12,260 --> 07:34:13,080
Oh no!

7096
07:34:16,280 --> 07:34:18,100
I knew it was gonna fill up with sand!

7097
07:34:20,500 --> 07:34:21,860
Oh god, I can't move.

7098
07:34:22,100 --> 07:34:22,920
I can barely move.

7099
07:34:23,240 --> 07:34:24,100
I'm gonna die.

7100
07:34:24,640 --> 07:34:25,000
What?

7101
07:34:27,160 --> 07:34:29,040
You die so fast.

7102
07:34:31,980 --> 07:34:33,600
You die so fast.

7103
07:34:33,660 --> 07:34:34,840
Okay, okay, okay.

7104
07:34:36,480 --> 07:34:37,080
Exit.

7105
07:34:37,420 --> 07:34:37,780
Exit.

7106
07:34:38,360 --> 07:34:38,560
Where?

7107
07:34:38,660 --> 07:34:39,060
Up there.

7108
07:34:40,800 --> 07:34:41,820
How can I reach it?

7109
07:34:42,820 --> 07:34:43,480
How can I reach?

7110
07:34:48,560 --> 07:34:49,780
Just go upwards?

7111
07:34:51,240 --> 07:34:51,940
Just keep grabbing.

7112
07:34:52,460 --> 07:34:52,760
Go!

7113
07:34:53,060 --> 07:34:53,620
Go!

7114
07:34:54,000 --> 07:34:54,540
Go!

7115
07:34:55,040 --> 07:34:55,460
Go!

7116
07:34:56,120 --> 07:34:56,660
Go!

7117
07:34:59,890 --> 07:35:01,050
Go Indy please!

7118
07:35:01,210 --> 07:35:01,490
Indy!

7119
07:35:01,890 --> 07:35:02,230
Indy!

7120
07:35:06,130 --> 07:35:06,510
Go!

7121
07:35:07,770 --> 07:35:07,770
Go!

7122
07:35:07,910 --> 07:35:07,970
Go!

7123
07:35:10,070 --> 07:35:11,830
Oh god, I just fell.

7124
07:35:12,230 --> 07:35:13,030
How awkward.

7125
07:35:13,510 --> 07:35:14,270
That's fine.

7126
07:35:15,090 --> 07:35:16,030
Let's just keep going.

7127
07:35:19,890 --> 07:35:21,330
I made it!

7128
07:35:21,930 --> 07:35:22,870
First try!

7129
07:35:23,650 --> 07:35:24,650
Where's our hat?

7130
07:35:28,110 --> 07:35:29,110
Our hat?

7131
07:35:30,030 --> 07:35:30,630
I made it!

7132
07:35:30,670 --> 07:35:31,550
See that's what I said!

7133
07:35:31,550 --> 07:35:32,930
Where's your hat?

7134
07:35:34,070 --> 07:35:35,350
Is it on your pants?

7135
07:35:35,890 --> 07:35:36,790
Or is that just sand?

7136
07:35:43,230 --> 07:35:44,630
His dang hat.

7137
07:35:44,790 --> 07:35:47,050
His smirk smile.

7138
07:35:47,350 --> 07:35:48,330
Oh there's the hat!

7139
07:35:53,160 --> 07:35:54,320
He got his cheese.

7140
07:35:54,480 --> 07:35:55,380
Nice cheese block.

7141
07:35:58,800 --> 07:36:00,300
Everyone's worst panicking moment.

7142
07:36:00,380 --> 07:36:01,180
A tiny ledge.

7143
07:36:03,340 --> 07:36:04,320
Oh my god.

7144
07:36:05,020 --> 07:36:05,800
Indy please.

7145
07:36:06,200 --> 07:36:07,060
Oh my god.

7146
07:36:07,500 --> 07:36:08,560
Oh my god.

7147
07:36:08,940 --> 07:36:09,340
Please.

7148
07:36:09,940 --> 07:36:10,640
Oh my god.

7149
07:36:11,060 --> 07:36:12,720
Why didn't you keep it in your pocket?

7150
07:36:14,780 --> 07:36:15,520
I can't.

7151
07:36:15,660 --> 07:36:17,540
They are going to steal it right under his nose.

7152
07:36:19,020 --> 07:36:19,420
Literally.

7153
07:36:22,840 --> 07:36:26,940
Is that a piece of the great circle in your pants or are you just happy to see me?

7154
07:36:59,760 --> 07:37:01,160
Enjoying the sun?

7155
07:37:01,160 --> 07:37:01,740
Piss by piss.

7156
07:37:11,000 --> 07:37:12,260
Indiana Jones!

7157
07:37:24,580 --> 07:37:27,380
Get up.

7158
07:37:34,720 --> 07:37:37,100
I can hear your gears turning now.

7159
07:37:37,780 --> 07:37:39,560
Yeah, it doesn't matter who solved it.

7160
07:37:39,660 --> 07:37:41,200
If the person who takes it.

7161
07:37:41,320 --> 07:37:43,240
It doesn't matter.

7162
07:37:49,420 --> 07:37:53,400
This guy is such a goof.

7163
07:37:53,900 --> 07:37:55,120
He spits everywhere.

7164
07:37:55,400 --> 07:37:55,820
Oh my god.

7165
07:37:55,840 --> 07:37:57,460
You can see the spit on his lips.

7166
07:37:58,280 --> 07:37:58,780
Oh my god.

7167
07:37:58,800 --> 07:37:59,620
He's so nasty.

7168
07:38:04,160 --> 07:38:04,680
No!

7169
07:38:09,400 --> 07:38:11,460
Get his ass in.

7170
07:38:18,920 --> 07:38:20,600
He looks so pathetic.

7171
07:38:21,880 --> 07:38:22,480
Help.

7172
07:38:22,700 --> 07:38:23,460
Uppies please.

7173
07:38:27,960 --> 07:38:28,900
I'm trying to move.

7174
07:38:31,140 --> 07:38:31,840
Oh god.

7175
07:38:31,920 --> 07:38:32,240
It's bright.

7176
07:38:35,360 --> 07:38:36,160
Himalayas?

7177
07:38:39,060 --> 07:38:44,200
Wait, are we going to...

7178
07:38:57,680 --> 07:38:59,480
It's a harsh climb anytime.

7179
07:39:01,920 --> 07:39:05,160
You've been to Antarctica, the Himalayas, or nothing?

7180
07:39:06,040 --> 07:39:08,740
It's like my other... what's it called?

7181
07:39:11,880 --> 07:39:14,580
My other fixation.

7182
07:39:19,900 --> 07:39:21,900
Let me uppies please.

7183
07:39:35,700 --> 07:39:39,480
What are you going to do with me?

7184
07:39:42,900 --> 07:39:44,460
Don't you dare.

7185
07:39:51,880 --> 07:39:53,280
My eyes are so bright.

7186
07:40:00,300 --> 07:40:01,560
Thank you.

7187
07:40:04,620 --> 07:40:05,460
Please.

7188
07:40:06,280 --> 07:40:07,460
Give me up.

7189
07:40:08,440 --> 07:40:09,380
Give me up.

7190
07:40:11,080 --> 07:40:12,460
There they go.

7191
07:40:15,880 --> 07:40:18,380
And then they're all gone just like that.

7192
07:40:21,000 --> 07:40:21,980
No way.

7193
07:40:22,700 --> 07:40:23,800
No way.

7194
07:40:24,360 --> 07:40:26,400
Where did this guy come from?

7195
07:40:38,600 --> 07:40:39,680
Are you serious?

7196
07:40:45,620 --> 07:40:47,040
Oh I'm supposed to be blowing.

7197
07:40:50,700 --> 07:40:51,580
Oh no.

7198
07:40:51,700 --> 07:40:52,420
Are you kidding me?

7199
07:40:53,060 --> 07:40:54,780
I didn't know this was part of the game.

7200
07:40:54,940 --> 07:40:55,560
Oh my god.

7201
07:40:57,680 --> 07:40:58,900
I have no stamina.

7202
07:40:59,340 --> 07:40:59,660
No!

7203
07:41:00,500 --> 07:41:01,420
I'm gonna die.

7204
07:41:01,740 --> 07:41:03,020
I'm gonna die to this...

7205
07:41:05,660 --> 07:41:07,020
Oh my god.

7206
07:41:07,380 --> 07:41:08,520
I'm blowing!

7207
07:41:09,300 --> 07:41:10,380
I have no stamina!

7208
07:41:19,290 --> 07:41:21,590
Oh my god.

7209
07:41:22,450 --> 07:41:24,070
Help me please!

7210
07:41:25,730 --> 07:41:29,670
Oh my god I was literally on 1 HP in a dream.

7211
07:41:30,930 --> 07:41:31,870
No way!

7212
07:41:35,830 --> 07:41:36,830
Help me!

7213
07:41:40,390 --> 07:41:42,950
I wonder if it's scripted.

7214
07:41:47,650 --> 07:41:49,010
Help me!

7215
07:41:49,070 --> 07:41:50,130
Oh we're dying.

7216
07:41:50,230 --> 07:41:50,910
We're so dead.

7217
07:41:53,510 --> 07:41:56,590
I didn't realize I was supposed to be blowing at first.

7218
07:41:58,690 --> 07:42:00,470
I think he needs an antidote.

7219
07:42:08,630 --> 07:42:09,770
I'm glad you're still alive.

7220
07:42:10,990 --> 07:42:12,650
You're beginning to grow on me Jones.

7221
07:42:14,510 --> 07:42:16,370
I actually died to the scorpions there.

7222
07:42:16,470 --> 07:42:17,390
Oh you can die?

7223
07:42:17,970 --> 07:42:18,470
Wow.

7224
07:42:19,650 --> 07:42:20,170
Again?

7225
07:42:26,010 --> 07:42:27,270
Oh he took it.

7226
07:42:39,530 --> 07:42:42,630
The Great Circle.

7227
07:42:52,690 --> 07:42:54,810
Machu Picchu.

7228
07:43:16,270 --> 07:43:16,830
Oh...

7229
07:43:16,830 --> 07:43:17,850
Ah!

7230
07:43:24,870 --> 07:43:27,330
Wait we gave her the...wait no.

7231
07:43:28,030 --> 07:43:31,430
Yeah we gave the...no we never gave it to her I guess technically.

7232
07:43:39,490 --> 07:43:40,670
Her boat!

7233
07:43:47,370 --> 07:43:49,290
We're on the boat.

7234
07:44:00,410 --> 07:44:06,890
I like this soft version of his theme song.

7235
07:44:07,150 --> 07:44:07,730
It's so cute.

7236
07:44:08,550 --> 07:44:09,510
Nice boat.

7237
07:44:09,830 --> 07:44:11,090
Not nice boat.

7238
07:44:11,310 --> 07:44:12,090
We're not nice boat.

7239
07:44:15,690 --> 07:44:16,330
Cute.

7240
07:44:49,720 --> 07:44:50,160
Cute.

7241
07:45:10,960 --> 07:45:12,880
I don't think it's a death flag.

7242
07:45:13,400 --> 07:45:15,980
It's not really Indiana Jones' style to kill off the world.

7243
07:45:25,140 --> 07:45:26,880
And you couldn't get another shirt.

7244
07:45:27,240 --> 07:45:28,780
You know what's so funny is I paid for that.

7245
07:45:30,860 --> 07:45:34,080
It's the Temple of Doom outfit so it's all like messed up.

7246
07:45:38,360 --> 07:45:39,820
It's supposed to be...

7247
07:45:41,280 --> 07:45:43,060
What was the German...Oh yeah!

7248
07:45:43,500 --> 07:45:44,780
I mean they did kill her off.

7249
07:45:45,480 --> 07:45:45,920
That's true.

7250
07:45:46,940 --> 07:45:47,840
Yeah this is true.

7251
07:45:55,120 --> 07:45:55,920
What?

7252
07:45:59,580 --> 07:46:02,600
Oh my god stop the Sherpas...No!

7253
07:46:10,340 --> 07:46:13,860
Oh my god Indiana Jones is about to...

7254
07:46:15,540 --> 07:46:17,980
Make up another body on Everest.

7255
07:46:18,080 --> 07:46:18,900
What the hell?

7256
07:46:20,660 --> 07:46:22,420
No she's dead now.

7257
07:46:23,940 --> 07:46:25,360
Food for the mountain.

7258
07:46:26,640 --> 07:46:27,560
Please be a dinosaur.

7259
07:46:27,780 --> 07:46:28,920
It sounds like a dinosaur but...

7260
07:46:30,300 --> 07:46:31,380
Sherpa ain't having it.

7261
07:46:33,420 --> 07:46:34,300
Stinky Everest.

7262
07:46:34,400 --> 07:46:35,640
This is before it became stinky.

7263
07:46:52,820 --> 07:46:54,300
I cannot believe it.

7264
07:46:54,820 --> 07:46:55,920
I can't believe we're here.

7265
07:46:59,680 --> 07:47:01,580
I'm trying to decide if I want to keep going.

7266
07:47:03,760 --> 07:47:06,500
I guess I'll get to like not...

7267
07:47:06,500 --> 07:47:08,080
Whatever this area is.

7268
07:47:08,980 --> 07:47:11,060
It would be so much less visible.

7269
07:47:11,360 --> 07:47:12,340
Oh my god the way...

7270
07:47:12,340 --> 07:47:16,940
The way Gina's NPC works she's not gonna make it you guys.

7271
07:47:19,080 --> 07:47:19,780
There we go.

7272
07:47:20,300 --> 07:47:21,340
She's not gonna make it.

7273
07:47:21,340 --> 07:47:23,080
Not with the way her NPC works.

7274
07:47:24,620 --> 07:47:25,980
There's a good stopping point ahead.

7275
07:47:26,080 --> 07:47:26,620
Okay perfect.

7276
07:47:26,800 --> 07:47:27,160
Thank you.

7277
07:47:28,620 --> 07:47:30,200
Thank you for the 20 gifts.

7278
07:47:30,300 --> 07:47:31,080
Thank you.

7279
07:47:31,240 --> 07:47:32,080
Thank you so much.

7280
07:47:32,160 --> 07:47:32,560
Thank you.

7281
07:47:34,200 --> 07:47:38,240
This would be a way...This is like actually not so bad visibility.

7282
07:47:38,800 --> 07:47:39,820
All things considered.

7283
07:47:40,960 --> 07:47:45,000
You wouldn't even be able to see right in front of your feet.

7284
07:47:48,900 --> 07:47:50,020
Oh my god.

7285
07:47:50,640 --> 07:47:51,120
Gina!

7286
07:47:51,620 --> 07:47:52,100
Gina!

7287
07:47:52,100 --> 07:47:52,400
Gina!

7288
07:47:53,520 --> 07:47:56,400
Oh my god!

7289
07:48:02,920 --> 07:48:04,680
There she goes!

7290
07:48:07,920 --> 07:48:09,660
Oh my god.

7291
07:48:10,960 --> 07:48:11,400
Girl!

7292
07:48:14,760 --> 07:48:16,160
Girl!

7293
07:48:20,500 --> 07:48:21,540
I'm going.

7294
07:48:22,360 --> 07:48:24,420
Better let me try it first!

7295
07:48:24,540 --> 07:48:25,260
She goes anyway.

7296
07:48:26,400 --> 07:48:29,440
I think she's actually trying to kill us honestly.

7297
07:48:30,760 --> 07:48:32,940
She's actually going to betray us.

7298
07:48:36,660 --> 07:48:38,480
Wait what's this way?

7299
07:48:42,100 --> 07:48:43,140
What's down there?

7300
07:48:45,140 --> 07:48:46,360
Oh my god.

7301
07:48:47,140 --> 07:48:48,460
This is so scary.

7302
07:48:53,180 --> 07:48:54,220
Death probably.

7303
07:48:55,140 --> 07:48:55,820
Yeah probably.

7304
07:48:56,120 --> 07:48:56,820
Oh up here?

7305
07:48:59,980 --> 07:49:01,400
Oh my god I can see her footsteps.

7306
07:49:01,480 --> 07:49:03,380
The snow looks so powdery and nice.

7307
07:49:04,440 --> 07:49:04,940
Gina no!

7308
07:49:05,380 --> 07:49:06,780
Gina please let me go first!

7309
07:49:08,480 --> 07:49:10,460
Okay she's just stepping on air.

7310
07:49:10,660 --> 07:49:11,520
I get it.

7311
07:49:15,440 --> 07:49:17,000
I would hope not.

7312
07:49:21,720 --> 07:49:24,740
Oh the snow crunch sounds so good right?

7313
07:49:32,910 --> 07:49:34,390
Don't go down there maybe.

7314
07:49:34,670 --> 07:49:35,530
Let's keep going up.

7315
07:49:39,150 --> 07:49:40,230
Snow crunch.

7316
07:49:42,610 --> 07:49:44,270
What do you mean?

7317
07:49:45,550 --> 07:49:46,090
It is here!

7318
07:49:46,270 --> 07:49:50,830
We literally heard him say Himalayas.

7319
07:49:58,780 --> 07:49:59,600
Yeah!

7320
07:50:00,280 --> 07:50:01,520
It's a ship!

7321
07:50:01,980 --> 07:50:02,340
A ship?

7322
07:50:03,300 --> 07:50:04,120
What?

7323
07:50:16,670 --> 07:50:19,270
Oh my god that's amazing.

7324
07:50:19,950 --> 07:50:20,570
What?

7325
07:50:21,510 --> 07:50:22,990
This is so awesome!

7326
07:50:24,050 --> 07:50:24,570
No!

7327
07:50:25,150 --> 07:50:28,790
I don't want to wait until I come back home for me to...

7328
07:50:29,870 --> 07:50:32,690
For me to learn mystery!

7329
07:50:35,110 --> 07:50:36,890
Feels like Uncharted now.

7330
07:50:39,510 --> 07:50:40,790
Just wait.

7331
07:50:41,530 --> 07:50:42,570
Let me do it first.

7332
07:50:49,290 --> 07:50:50,050
Just kidding.

7333
07:50:50,050 --> 07:50:51,130
You seeing this too?

7334
07:50:52,870 --> 07:50:53,350
Yeah!

7335
07:50:54,090 --> 07:50:54,950
It's a ship!

7336
07:50:55,930 --> 07:50:56,410
Good!

7337
07:50:57,030 --> 07:50:58,070
But I'm not crazy!

7338
07:51:00,430 --> 07:51:01,950
Ancient aliens are the best.

7339
07:51:01,970 --> 07:51:02,930
Let's get a closer look.

7340
07:51:10,870 --> 07:51:12,690
What was I supposed to do?

7341
07:51:13,730 --> 07:51:15,210
Oh now I can grab on to it.

7342
07:51:15,230 --> 07:51:15,610
Hey!

7343
07:51:15,730 --> 07:51:16,410
Me first!

7344
07:51:22,000 --> 07:51:22,340
No!

7345
07:51:22,420 --> 07:51:23,520
Me first!

7346
07:51:24,460 --> 07:51:25,140
Dice!

7347
07:51:30,380 --> 07:51:31,560
I don't know!

7348
07:51:36,040 --> 07:51:37,240
That's insane!

7349
07:51:37,420 --> 07:51:38,880
That is so awesome!

7350
07:51:39,680 --> 07:51:41,360
What a grueling...Oh my gosh!

7351
07:51:41,440 --> 07:51:44,340
What a...like the anchor just like dangling in the wind.

7352
07:51:44,660 --> 07:51:45,600
Oh my god!

7353
07:51:46,080 --> 07:51:46,760
The...

7354
07:51:46,760 --> 07:51:48,320
It's such a cool visual!

7355
07:51:48,320 --> 07:51:49,880
Oh my god!

7356
07:51:49,940 --> 07:51:51,560
And like the sounds it's making!

7357
07:51:52,080 --> 07:51:53,220
I'm like freaking out.

7358
07:51:53,300 --> 07:51:54,180
It's so awesome.

7359
07:51:56,280 --> 07:51:57,660
I don't think it's Noah's Ark.

7360
07:51:57,760 --> 07:51:59,320
It has literal guns on it.

7361
07:52:00,500 --> 07:52:01,820
You can see them.

7362
07:52:03,660 --> 07:52:04,100
Wow!

7363
07:52:04,180 --> 07:52:05,120
It looks so awesome.

7364
07:52:17,940 --> 07:52:18,860
Like look at it!

7365
07:52:19,000 --> 07:52:19,520
Wow!

7366
07:52:20,420 --> 07:52:21,380
And like the sounds.

7367
07:52:21,560 --> 07:52:21,740
Like the...

7368
07:52:21,740 --> 07:52:23,500
Like the creaking and everything.

7369
07:52:23,500 --> 07:52:23,720
Anything?

7370
07:52:25,540 --> 07:52:25,980
Ok.

7371
07:52:28,100 --> 07:52:31,600
I don't think any kind of picture is going to look good in this but...

7372
07:52:32,040 --> 07:52:33,620
The ship that disappeared!

7373
07:52:34,580 --> 07:52:36,220
The one that disappeared in Peru!

7374
07:52:49,760 --> 07:52:50,200
Comet!

7375
07:52:56,380 --> 07:52:57,220
Oh my god!

7376
07:52:57,280 --> 07:52:58,400
The snow is so deep.

7377
07:53:03,240 --> 07:53:05,120
It's so awesome!

7378
07:53:05,960 --> 07:53:06,840
Oh my god!

7379
07:53:06,980 --> 07:53:10,640
The audio design is so incredible here.

7380
07:53:11,040 --> 07:53:11,480
I'm sorry.

7381
07:53:11,640 --> 07:53:13,880
I keep freaking out because it sounds so good!

7382
07:53:17,840 --> 07:53:18,560
Probably.

7383
07:53:39,750 --> 07:53:41,230
It's so creepy.

7384
07:53:42,010 --> 07:53:43,410
Is it even stable?

7385
07:53:43,630 --> 07:53:45,290
I don't quite think so.

7386
07:53:54,560 --> 07:53:55,220
Oh look!

7387
07:53:55,260 --> 07:53:56,840
We can see the ledge where we came from!

7388
07:54:02,460 --> 07:54:03,380
It does?

7389
07:54:11,330 --> 07:54:12,090
Oh my god.

7390
07:54:12,310 --> 07:54:13,510
Little frozen...

7391
07:54:15,310 --> 07:54:16,110
Where do I go?

7392
07:54:23,730 --> 07:54:24,170
Limp.

7393
07:54:25,330 --> 07:54:26,430
Where do I go from here?

7394
07:54:27,990 --> 07:54:28,750
Oh in here?

7395
07:54:29,530 --> 07:54:29,790
Maybe?

7396
07:54:30,790 --> 07:54:31,610
Oh here we go.

7397
07:54:34,860 --> 07:54:35,560
Help her.

7398
07:54:38,380 --> 07:54:38,820
Shadow!

7399
07:54:39,080 --> 07:54:39,780
Welcome to Batmusha!

7400
07:54:39,840 --> 07:54:40,240
Thank you!

7401
07:54:41,760 --> 07:54:43,620
The sounds of creaking metal are so good.

7402
07:54:43,700 --> 07:54:44,080
I know!

7403
07:54:44,240 --> 07:54:44,960
It's so freaky!

7404
07:54:55,240 --> 07:54:55,680
Hello?

7405
07:55:03,690 --> 07:55:05,210
Why did he look like that?

7406
07:55:11,460 --> 07:55:12,140
Oh my god.

7407
07:55:12,160 --> 07:55:13,420
It's so chilly in here.

7408
07:55:18,460 --> 07:55:18,860
Somehow.

7409
07:55:21,980 --> 07:55:23,820
I don't think it will let us back out.

7410
07:55:24,080 --> 07:55:24,720
Or I think I can...

7411
07:55:26,840 --> 07:55:28,820
It's so freaky in here!

7412
07:55:29,460 --> 07:55:29,680
Wait.

7413
07:55:29,700 --> 07:55:30,780
I don't want to end quite yet.

7414
07:55:31,120 --> 07:55:32,220
I'm going to keep going a little bit more.

7415
07:55:32,300 --> 07:55:32,500
Sorry.

7416
07:55:37,180 --> 07:55:38,800
Is anyone alive in here?

7417
07:55:39,260 --> 07:55:41,860
Like did they just send the guys?

7418
07:55:43,420 --> 07:55:44,500
A ghost ship.

7419
07:55:44,620 --> 07:55:46,440
Did they just send the guys here like this?

7420
07:55:53,020 --> 07:55:54,300
Congrats on 300k.

7421
07:55:54,400 --> 07:55:55,080
Thank you!

7422
07:55:57,460 --> 07:55:59,000
It might turn into a 12 hour stream.

7423
07:55:59,420 --> 07:56:00,020
Probably not.

7424
07:56:00,280 --> 07:56:00,620
Maybe.

7425
07:56:00,900 --> 07:56:01,220
I don't know.

7426
07:56:04,980 --> 07:56:05,720
Probably not.

7427
07:56:05,880 --> 07:56:06,240
I don't know.

7428
07:56:06,340 --> 07:56:06,580
Maybe.

7429
07:56:06,780 --> 07:56:07,200
Who knows.

7430
07:56:07,340 --> 07:56:07,680
I don't know.

7431
07:56:07,680 --> 07:56:09,080
Probably not.

7432
07:56:10,180 --> 07:56:11,900
It's already 11PM for me.

7433
07:56:12,800 --> 07:56:13,900
I still haven't finished my dinner.

7434
07:56:18,050 --> 07:56:19,370
This place seems chill.

7435
07:56:21,150 --> 07:56:23,350
Is it attached to a hand?

7436
07:56:40,480 --> 07:56:41,080
Frozen.

7437
07:56:50,440 --> 07:56:51,060
Damn!

7438
07:56:51,860 --> 07:56:54,040
Nah, I don't need that.

7439
07:56:58,240 --> 07:56:59,760
Hand it over?

7440
07:57:04,820 --> 07:57:07,140
Prepare to fight the Yeti monster.

7441
07:57:07,280 --> 07:57:08,260
Don't say that!

7442
07:57:10,660 --> 07:57:14,220
But being Indiana Jones I can't tell what's serious and what's not.

7443
07:57:20,370 --> 07:57:21,190
Buckle up.

7444
07:57:23,670 --> 07:57:24,370
Thank you.

7445
07:57:26,390 --> 07:57:26,990
What?

7446
07:57:27,270 --> 07:57:27,910
This way?

7447
07:57:28,090 --> 07:57:28,290
Oh.

7448
07:57:29,790 --> 07:57:30,790
Search the ship.

7449
07:57:33,590 --> 07:57:34,850
That's so freaky.

7450
07:57:35,830 --> 07:57:36,870
What is this now?

7451
07:57:37,610 --> 07:57:38,450
This thing?

7452
07:57:39,210 --> 07:57:39,670
Right here?

7453
07:57:39,830 --> 07:57:40,570
Oh, other side?

7454
07:57:43,840 --> 07:57:45,960
We gotta go back to the handle.

7455
07:57:46,620 --> 07:57:48,120
Which was down this way.

7456
07:57:48,760 --> 07:57:49,540
Right here.

7457
07:57:57,660 --> 07:57:58,180
Hehehe.

7458
07:58:03,040 --> 07:58:05,140
Oh my god.

7459
07:58:05,400 --> 07:58:06,980
Oh my god.

7460
07:58:08,440 --> 07:58:09,300
Survivors account.

7461
07:58:10,440 --> 07:58:12,260
I think almost half of the crew is dead now.

7462
07:58:14,020 --> 07:58:15,640
Yeah, there's like 15 of them.

7463
07:58:16,060 --> 07:58:17,680
We need to remove bodies.

7464
07:58:18,600 --> 07:58:19,340
But it can wait.

7465
07:58:20,100 --> 07:58:21,760
The cold slows the rot.

7466
07:58:21,760 --> 07:58:24,860
I organize the surviving members of my division into groups.

7467
07:58:25,340 --> 07:58:30,160
One is scouting the larder for supplies and the others are trying to find anything burnable.

7468
07:58:30,660 --> 07:58:32,780
Heat is a higher priority than food right now.

7469
07:58:36,420 --> 07:58:39,020
We can endure long enough for rescue to arrive.

7470
07:58:39,340 --> 07:58:40,400
But some are not cooperative.

7471
07:58:40,620 --> 07:58:41,660
Move, Jaina!

7472
07:58:42,360 --> 07:58:45,460
A group of the men declared the mess their territory.

7473
07:58:45,780 --> 07:58:47,480
They shoot anyone who tries to get in.

7474
07:58:47,780 --> 07:58:49,940
Another group abandoned their post and went...

7475
07:58:49,940 --> 07:58:52,300
Wait, does that mean...

7476
07:58:52,300 --> 07:58:54,320
I wonder if those guys are still alive.

7477
07:58:57,120 --> 07:59:01,480
We're going to find Luke Skywalker upside down with that giant yeti-like monster.

7478
07:59:02,480 --> 07:59:04,740
What do you mean this is the wrong air support movie?

7479
07:59:10,400 --> 07:59:16,260
Another group abandoned their post and went outside in a foolish attempt to climb down the mountain and find help.

7480
07:59:16,800 --> 07:59:18,840
No one knows where the captain and his officers are.

7481
07:59:18,840 --> 07:59:19,580
Cowards.

7482
07:59:19,960 --> 07:59:23,780
We can survive this, but only if we work together for the greater good.

7483
07:59:27,800 --> 07:59:32,420
None of you took off your clothes and tried to huddle up together.

7484
07:59:32,820 --> 07:59:35,020
Look, they're all frowning.

7485
07:59:35,300 --> 07:59:37,720
This guy has the pole going through his face.

7486
07:59:41,740 --> 07:59:43,720
None of you even tried to do that.

7487
07:59:45,440 --> 07:59:47,000
Oh gosh, there's so many of them.

7488
07:59:47,460 --> 07:59:48,580
We're just chilling in here.

7489
07:59:48,780 --> 07:59:49,400
Get it?

7490
07:59:50,400 --> 07:59:50,600
lol

7491
07:59:55,020 --> 07:59:56,400
Oh, sad.

7492
07:59:57,620 --> 07:59:59,240
Oh my god!

7493
07:59:59,840 --> 08:00:01,940
This one is so bad.

7494
08:00:03,620 --> 08:00:05,520
You're awful for that.

7495
08:00:06,240 --> 08:00:06,600
What?

7496
08:00:11,080 --> 08:00:13,220
Oh my god, this too.

7497
08:00:14,800 --> 08:00:15,600
Let's go upstairs.

7498
08:00:15,600 --> 08:00:15,720
Let's go upstairs.

7499
08:00:19,420 --> 08:00:21,080
There's just guys everywhere.

7500
08:00:23,800 --> 08:00:24,900
Guys everywhere.

7501
08:00:27,620 --> 08:00:28,860
They're nachos.

7502
08:00:30,680 --> 08:00:30,880
Yeah.

7503
08:00:31,900 --> 08:00:35,960
Sometimes it saves at really random parts and I'm like, why are you saving, huh?

7504
08:00:36,180 --> 08:00:36,360
Oh!

7505
08:00:37,320 --> 08:00:38,100
Take a bandage.

7506
08:00:39,580 --> 08:00:41,200
Did I lose all my stuff?

7507
08:00:42,080 --> 08:00:42,700
No.

7508
08:00:44,700 --> 08:00:47,660
I guess we won't be finding any fruit in here though, huh?

7509
08:00:48,560 --> 08:00:49,460
Well, maybe bread.

7510
08:00:52,760 --> 08:00:55,680
I'm interested in the mess hall.

7511
08:00:56,240 --> 08:00:56,460
Wait.

7512
08:01:01,340 --> 08:01:02,740
I thought I heard whispering.

7513
08:01:06,980 --> 08:01:08,480
I thought I heard whispering.

7514
08:01:09,020 --> 08:01:10,600
You think I can... let's see.

7515
08:01:10,760 --> 08:01:12,900
Let's try and shatter this guy.

7516
08:01:13,260 --> 08:01:13,460
No.

7517
08:01:14,060 --> 08:01:15,020
Someone more accessible.

7518
08:01:16,580 --> 08:01:17,540
Him?

7519
08:01:19,500 --> 08:01:19,820
No.

7520
08:01:20,500 --> 08:01:21,340
Move, Gina.

7521
08:01:25,600 --> 08:01:26,800
Why

7522
08:01:31,720 --> 08:01:34,020
is the music getting all freaky?

7523
08:01:34,800 --> 08:01:35,420
All of a sudden.

7524
08:01:43,720 --> 08:01:44,920
No.

7525
08:01:49,980 --> 08:01:50,580
Okay.

7526
08:01:50,580 --> 08:01:55,240
But we still have to search the whole ship to find him.

7527
08:01:56,060 --> 08:01:57,060
Will we not?

7528
08:02:02,240 --> 08:02:02,780
Gina!

7529
08:02:08,820 --> 08:02:09,360
Go!

7530
08:02:13,610 --> 08:02:14,150
Alright.

7531
08:02:15,990 --> 08:02:17,010
Wait, what do you mean by that?

7532
08:02:22,790 --> 08:02:23,690
Thanks for the stream.

7533
08:02:23,790 --> 08:02:24,210
Thank you!

7534
08:02:29,010 --> 08:02:30,250
It's so scary.

7535
08:02:31,030 --> 08:02:32,770
I love it, but I hate it.

7536
08:02:34,030 --> 08:02:35,190
I love scary!

7537
08:02:41,670 --> 08:02:47,450
Why does she look so sassy?

7538
08:02:47,870 --> 08:02:48,690
Who's watching her?

7539
08:02:53,680 --> 08:02:53,840
What?

7540
08:02:54,240 --> 08:02:54,880
What do you see?

7541
08:02:55,700 --> 08:02:56,500
Do you see the stone?

7542
08:03:04,460 --> 08:03:05,040
No.

7543
08:03:08,000 --> 08:03:08,580
No.

7544
08:03:13,710 --> 08:03:14,870
Oh no.

7545
08:03:31,080 --> 08:03:33,300
So that boss guy was lying even then.

7546
08:03:35,340 --> 08:03:37,120
That guy was lying then.

7547
08:03:37,220 --> 08:03:39,900
He was just like, oh she's happy with us, blah blah blah.

7548
08:03:40,740 --> 08:03:42,880
Oh she's, you know, she's fine.

7549
08:03:43,640 --> 08:03:45,620
And she's working with us.

7550
08:03:49,680 --> 08:03:50,560
Oh no.

7551
08:04:03,420 --> 08:04:15,130
I need to know what happened here.

7552
08:04:22,340 --> 08:04:25,640
I didn't know you could do that with the camera.

7553
08:04:25,740 --> 08:04:29,900
Yeah, you can move it around in cutscenes, but it doesn't really add much.

7554
08:04:33,170 --> 08:04:34,850
How did she know it was her?

7555
08:04:35,130 --> 08:04:37,290
Maybe she just was like sisterly sense.

7556
08:04:47,780 --> 08:04:49,300
Like MGS2 codec.

7557
08:05:05,880 --> 08:05:10,560
What was that?

7558
08:05:11,460 --> 08:05:12,240
A workers permit?

7559
08:05:13,140 --> 08:05:13,660
Oh no!

7560
08:05:13,860 --> 08:05:14,380
They're here!

7561
08:05:16,600 --> 08:05:18,740
They didn't get much time at all, huh?

7562
08:05:20,360 --> 08:05:20,880
Oh.

7563
08:05:26,410 --> 08:05:27,330
Oh an idea.

7564
08:05:27,770 --> 08:05:28,330
Nacho idea.

7565
08:05:32,190 --> 08:05:33,290
Fold the earth?

7566
08:05:44,360 --> 08:05:46,080
Oh my god, they're coming.

7567
08:05:46,240 --> 08:05:46,700
We hear them.

7568
08:05:47,260 --> 08:05:48,780
Don't cry, your tears will freeze.

7569
08:05:56,890 --> 08:05:59,730
Yeah, maybe like a wormhole or something.

7570
08:06:02,390 --> 08:06:02,990
Cool.

7571
08:06:07,730 --> 08:06:08,710
Oh my god!

7572
08:06:22,620 --> 08:06:24,360
I'm not gonna let you shoot that!

7573
08:06:25,580 --> 08:06:26,180
Hey!

7574
08:06:29,040 --> 08:06:30,040
These guys are tough.

7575
08:06:32,400 --> 08:06:33,620
These guys are tough!

7576
08:06:35,960 --> 08:06:38,180
Oh my god, she just went after them.

7577
08:06:38,180 --> 08:06:39,920
I thought I had a weapon.

7578
08:06:40,320 --> 08:06:41,160
I guess it's gone now.

7579
08:06:41,220 --> 08:06:42,180
Oh we can see her.

7580
08:06:42,800 --> 08:06:43,720
Oh it's kind of freaky.

7581
08:06:46,680 --> 08:06:50,140
I am just looking at your dead sister real quick.

7582
08:06:50,180 --> 08:06:50,560
Hold on.

7583
08:06:52,720 --> 08:06:54,680
Let's see if there is anything else around here.

7584
08:06:56,160 --> 08:06:56,860
Hold on!

7585
08:06:57,960 --> 08:06:59,680
You do this to me every time Gina!

7586
08:06:59,760 --> 08:07:00,560
You rush me!

7587
08:07:00,800 --> 08:07:01,860
You rush me Gina!

7588
08:07:01,980 --> 08:07:03,980
And I'm an explorer and I'm a hoarder!

7589
08:07:03,980 --> 08:07:04,720
Ok Gina!

7590
08:07:05,000 --> 08:07:06,760
You have to understand Gina!

7591
08:07:06,840 --> 08:07:08,380
This is just my way of doing things!

7592
08:07:14,410 --> 08:07:14,990
Yes!

7593
08:07:18,550 --> 08:07:19,790
I'm gonna take this.

7594
08:07:20,490 --> 08:07:22,470
I wish I could hold multiple weapons.

7595
08:07:24,950 --> 08:07:26,850
Maybe I will take the shotgun.

7596
08:07:26,850 --> 08:07:26,970
Hold on.

7597
08:07:41,840 --> 08:07:42,280
Sad.

7598
08:07:46,000 --> 08:07:47,340
You can't bring it up the stairs.

7599
08:07:55,800 --> 08:07:57,260
Indy is so fragile.

7600
08:07:58,500 --> 08:07:59,860
Indy is very, very fragile.

7601
08:07:59,960 --> 08:08:00,920
You guys please understand.

7602
08:08:01,420 --> 08:08:02,380
Watch your back.

7603
08:08:03,140 --> 08:08:05,420
How do they set up everything so fast?

7604
08:08:20,730 --> 08:08:21,790
I'm following you.

7605
08:08:21,950 --> 08:08:22,930
Oh maybe I shouldn't have.

7606
08:08:23,330 --> 08:08:24,070
Where are you going?

7607
08:08:25,110 --> 08:08:26,030
Where are you going?

7608
08:08:29,950 --> 08:08:31,350
Ok, where am I going?

7609
08:08:32,990 --> 08:08:34,730
We are going... where this way?

7610
08:08:36,970 --> 08:08:37,530
What?

7611
08:08:39,250 --> 08:08:40,490
I saw something.

7612
08:08:41,250 --> 08:08:42,330
Everyone is dead.

7613
08:08:43,790 --> 08:08:44,970
Everyone is dead.

7614
08:08:51,300 --> 08:08:51,780
Keep going?

7615
08:08:53,140 --> 08:08:55,740
Oh, we are about to get spotted but not really.

7616
08:08:56,620 --> 08:08:58,400
Now you are just imagining things.

7617
08:08:59,300 --> 08:08:59,980
Where am I going?

7618
08:09:00,400 --> 08:09:02,400
I'm going further away from where I need to go.

7619
08:09:06,470 --> 08:09:07,690
What's going on?

7620
08:09:08,190 --> 08:09:08,870
What do you mean?

7621
08:09:09,390 --> 08:09:11,330
He is acting like we are his subordinates.

7622
08:09:13,530 --> 08:09:13,890
Come here.

7623
08:09:15,430 --> 08:09:16,350
Gina, where are you?

7624
08:09:16,430 --> 08:09:17,030
I need some backup.

7625
08:09:18,390 --> 08:09:19,030
Oh my god!

7626
08:09:19,310 --> 08:09:21,250
Gina, I thought you were a guy!

7627
08:09:22,570 --> 08:09:23,970
Oh my god!

7628
08:09:24,550 --> 08:09:25,790
Oh my god!

7629
08:09:25,910 --> 08:09:26,290
Gina!

7630
08:09:26,710 --> 08:09:31,370
I don't remember how to look over...

7631
08:09:39,750 --> 08:09:40,850
I got him.

7632
08:09:42,410 --> 08:09:43,950
Only 6 shots.

7633
08:09:57,620 --> 08:09:58,340
Gina!

7634
08:10:03,800 --> 08:10:05,820
Maybe I shouldn't have sniped him.

7635
08:10:18,880 --> 08:10:19,520
It's fine.

7636
08:10:21,900 --> 08:10:22,820
We can go through here.

7637
08:10:23,500 --> 08:10:25,320
Gina, don't go that way.

7638
08:10:29,590 --> 08:10:31,050
Real stealth moments.

7639
08:10:31,850 --> 08:10:32,050
What?

7640
08:10:34,210 --> 08:10:35,650
Oh my god!

7641
08:10:36,530 --> 08:10:39,730
I thought you were... Jesus, girl!

7642
08:10:44,770 --> 08:10:45,370
God!

7643
08:10:47,170 --> 08:10:48,830
I'm actually trying to be sneaky here, okay?

7644
08:10:53,440 --> 08:10:54,380
Don't go over there.

7645
08:10:54,820 --> 08:10:55,360
Not yet.

7646
08:10:57,100 --> 08:10:58,580
Yellow equals friend.

7647
08:11:03,910 --> 08:11:05,510
Let's see if we can get past him.

7648
08:11:11,010 --> 08:11:11,810
Fuck!

7649
08:11:13,890 --> 08:11:15,490
Get ragdolled.

7650
08:11:15,590 --> 08:11:17,390
This looks like it could be the captain.

7651
08:11:28,970 --> 08:11:30,210
He flew.

7652
08:11:31,090 --> 08:11:32,190
Girl, hide.

7653
08:11:42,680 --> 08:11:44,540
I'm just gonna shoot anybody.

7654
08:11:45,800 --> 08:11:47,560
He sounds so close.

7655
08:11:47,660 --> 08:11:49,540
That's why it's so freaking me out.

7656
08:12:06,680 --> 08:12:07,640
Gina, are you okay?

7657
08:12:15,740 --> 08:12:17,120
Who just loaded?

7658
08:12:22,720 --> 08:12:23,240
Anyway...

7659
08:12:23,900 --> 08:12:24,680
Through here?

7660
08:12:25,220 --> 08:12:25,600
I think.

7661
08:12:27,640 --> 08:12:28,340
I think she's okay.

7662
08:12:31,020 --> 08:12:31,280
Too fun.

7663
08:12:36,820 --> 08:12:37,280
God!

7664
08:12:40,480 --> 08:12:42,700
Why were you reverse gripping the gun?

7665
08:12:42,900 --> 08:12:46,500
Because it ran out of bullets and that's what happens when you run out of bullets.

7666
08:12:47,580 --> 08:12:49,380
Oh man, we got so far.

7667
08:12:54,640 --> 08:12:55,880
Why me don't know heal?

7668
08:12:56,120 --> 08:12:56,620
I forgot.

7669
08:12:56,900 --> 08:12:57,260
That's why.

7670
08:13:18,670 --> 08:13:20,690
Yeah, the masked guys are tricky.

7671
08:13:21,590 --> 08:13:23,010
They are not easy.

7672
08:13:26,450 --> 08:13:27,790
Is that me?

7673
08:13:28,330 --> 08:13:29,410
Am I going...

7674
08:13:48,950 --> 08:13:50,750
Did I just cough?

7675
08:13:51,630 --> 08:13:52,730
Why am I so cold?

7676
08:13:55,650 --> 08:13:57,570
Do I need more food or something?

7677
08:13:57,570 --> 08:14:02,130
Do I need more food?

7678
08:14:02,550 --> 08:14:03,570
Why am I so cold?

7679
08:14:09,410 --> 08:14:12,110
I wasn't shivering like this before though.

7680
08:14:12,350 --> 08:14:13,670
I'm nervous.

7681
08:14:19,350 --> 08:14:20,870
Oh no.

7682
08:14:21,410 --> 08:14:22,370
A man down.

7683
08:14:22,690 --> 08:14:23,050
Nothing.

7684
08:14:23,050 --> 08:14:23,110
Nothing.

7685
08:14:28,190 --> 08:14:30,370
I got him.

7686
08:14:42,710 --> 08:14:43,470
Oh shit.

7687
08:14:55,460 --> 08:14:55,960
Fire?

7688
08:14:57,100 --> 08:14:58,140
Don't do that.

7689
08:14:59,580 --> 08:15:00,740
Gina, watch out.

7690
08:15:02,220 --> 08:15:03,440
Can I grab a shotgun?

7691
08:15:04,140 --> 08:15:04,920
Oh shit.

7692
08:15:05,460 --> 08:15:05,800
Oh shit.

7693
08:15:07,520 --> 08:15:08,020
Oh shit.

7694
08:15:12,380 --> 08:15:14,080
I could headshot, but I'm not.

7695
08:15:45,370 --> 08:15:46,590
I made it.

7696
08:15:46,770 --> 08:15:47,590
Oh my god Gina.

7697
08:15:48,110 --> 08:15:48,770
Where are you?

7698
08:15:49,170 --> 08:15:51,070
Don't just brush off like nothing happened.

7699
08:15:51,470 --> 08:15:51,930
Come on girl.

7700
08:15:54,170 --> 08:15:56,050
Is there anything down here that I can use?

7701
08:15:56,750 --> 08:15:57,790
Two bullets.

7702
08:15:59,010 --> 08:16:00,050
Four bullets.

7703
08:16:02,410 --> 08:16:03,210
Five bullets.

7704
08:16:03,670 --> 08:16:04,370
I can count.

7705
08:16:08,240 --> 08:16:09,260
Anyway, where are we going?

7706
08:16:09,640 --> 08:16:10,020
Over here?

7707
08:16:12,160 --> 08:16:12,740
What's that?

7708
08:16:13,580 --> 08:16:15,040
Maybe I will take that instead.

7709
08:16:16,220 --> 08:16:18,180
Try not to alert too many guards, you know?

7710
08:16:19,760 --> 08:16:21,940
Why does it look less frozen in these places?

7711
08:16:22,080 --> 08:16:22,940
They just got here.

7712
08:16:24,000 --> 08:16:24,700
Oh hi raiders!

7713
08:16:24,880 --> 08:16:28,410
I don't know who raided me, but...

7714
08:16:29,050 --> 08:16:29,550
Hello, hello!

7715
08:16:30,390 --> 08:16:33,530
Playing Indiana Jones and it's very mysterious and fun.

7716
08:16:35,410 --> 08:16:37,390
Very mysterious and fun.

7717
08:16:38,230 --> 08:16:38,990
Over here.

7718
08:16:47,570 --> 08:16:48,970
More dead guys.

7719
08:16:49,970 --> 08:16:50,770
Oh the game just saved?

7720
08:16:50,850 --> 08:16:51,110
Nice.

7721
08:16:55,230 --> 08:16:56,710
They are here.

7722
08:16:58,190 --> 08:16:58,950
Something.

7723
08:16:59,370 --> 08:16:59,810
Camera.

7724
08:17:00,370 --> 08:17:01,390
What am I taking a picture of?

7725
08:17:02,710 --> 08:17:03,190
Ahem.

7726
08:17:04,970 --> 08:17:05,450
Miuna.

7727
08:17:05,970 --> 08:17:06,250
Hello!

7728
08:17:06,670 --> 08:17:07,510
Thank you!

7729
08:17:11,390 --> 08:17:13,030
He's like yeah I'm gonna check it out.

7730
08:17:13,430 --> 08:17:14,590
Casey thanks for the five!

7731
08:17:14,670 --> 08:17:15,530
Gifted Deku!

7732
08:17:16,470 --> 08:17:17,470
Glad you are still alive.

7733
08:17:18,110 --> 08:17:18,590
Yeah!

7734
08:17:21,550 --> 08:17:23,590
Oh my god this guy doesn't even have shoes.

7735
08:17:24,150 --> 08:17:25,190
Oh there is a chain in the way?

7736
08:17:27,390 --> 08:17:27,870
I...

7737
08:17:28,690 --> 08:17:30,370
Honestly don't know when to stop.

7738
08:17:33,730 --> 08:17:34,190
Oh.

7739
08:17:34,470 --> 08:17:35,190
Thanks mod.

7740
08:17:38,050 --> 08:17:39,270
Woah 8 hours.

7741
08:17:39,410 --> 08:17:41,010
Yeah I really like this game!

7742
08:17:41,110 --> 08:17:42,370
It's a lot of fun!

7743
08:17:43,550 --> 08:17:44,850
What am I getting rid of?

7744
08:17:45,210 --> 08:17:45,730
The chain?

7745
08:17:47,350 --> 08:17:47,990
Hold on.

7746
08:17:48,150 --> 08:17:48,990
Let me go up there.

7747
08:17:49,350 --> 08:17:50,670
Check out what she's looking at.

7748
08:17:56,190 --> 08:17:56,650
Chain?

7749
08:17:58,390 --> 08:17:58,850
Train.

7750
08:17:58,850 --> 08:17:59,050
Train.

7751
08:18:02,010 --> 08:18:03,690
Do you think I can make that?

7752
08:18:06,230 --> 08:18:07,710
I don't know what she's talking about.

7753
08:18:08,650 --> 08:18:09,530
Oh this one.

7754
08:18:10,290 --> 08:18:10,970
What did I say?

7755
08:18:11,050 --> 08:18:11,930
I would take care of it?

7756
08:18:11,970 --> 08:18:13,190
What am I gonna do about it?

7757
08:18:19,180 --> 08:18:21,260
What am I supposed to do about it?

7758
08:18:23,320 --> 08:18:24,220
Just go under?

7759
08:18:24,400 --> 08:18:24,780
I don't know.

7760
08:18:24,860 --> 08:18:25,840
What do you want me to do?

7761
08:18:27,380 --> 08:18:30,040
Better keep looking for... What?

7762
08:18:32,040 --> 08:18:34,000
Indy what are you talking about?

7763
08:18:34,640 --> 08:18:35,640
Try punching it?

7764
08:18:36,540 --> 08:18:37,520
Punch the ice.

7765
08:18:47,690 --> 08:18:48,590
Let's see.

7766
08:18:51,670 --> 08:18:53,890
There is obviously a way that I can...

7767
08:18:56,150 --> 08:18:58,830
Something to do down there but I'm not quite sure.

7768
08:19:01,570 --> 08:19:02,590
Go down.

7769
08:19:02,910 --> 08:19:05,610
Please stop floating you freak of nature.

7770
08:19:09,070 --> 08:19:12,290
Rub your hands together then touch the ice.

7771
08:19:14,650 --> 08:19:17,990
That's not something we do.

7772
08:19:19,550 --> 08:19:22,750
Let me just see what this is.

7773
08:19:25,850 --> 08:19:27,710
Be careful Indy.

7774
08:19:28,230 --> 08:19:29,630
Maybe I go down here.

7775
08:19:32,970 --> 08:19:33,690
No, no.

7776
08:19:33,870 --> 08:19:34,090
Down.

7777
08:19:36,130 --> 08:19:36,650
Maybe.

7778
08:19:37,290 --> 08:19:38,470
Is there something down here?

7779
08:19:43,570 --> 08:19:44,430
What's this?

7780
08:19:44,810 --> 08:19:45,410
Punch the ice.

7781
08:19:46,870 --> 08:19:48,030
No Indy come on!

7782
08:19:50,190 --> 08:19:52,310
There is no weapon here to break it.

7783
08:19:52,410 --> 08:19:53,710
You gotta do... Wait.

7784
08:19:54,270 --> 08:19:55,810
Maybe I can throw it down here.

7785
08:19:58,330 --> 08:19:59,130
Ok hold on.

7786
08:20:02,530 --> 08:20:03,610
Lick the ice.

7787
08:20:03,810 --> 08:20:04,750
Pee on the ice.

7788
08:20:04,930 --> 08:20:05,790
Look at the chain.

7789
08:20:05,990 --> 08:20:06,810
Hold on!

7790
08:20:08,830 --> 08:20:10,170
Hold on with the chain!

7791
08:20:10,230 --> 08:20:11,670
I just found a secret area.

7792
08:20:14,270 --> 08:20:17,550
And there was a thing to break it.

7793
08:20:19,370 --> 08:20:20,330
Close by.

7794
08:20:21,290 --> 08:20:21,750
I thought.

7795
08:20:22,190 --> 08:20:23,230
I thought I had one.

7796
08:20:24,530 --> 08:20:26,730
Gosh this is so ominous and spooky.

7797
08:20:28,330 --> 08:20:29,630
There was something wasn't there?

7798
08:20:31,570 --> 08:20:32,590
So bright.

7799
08:20:32,870 --> 08:20:34,430
I'll take that.

7800
08:20:34,630 --> 08:20:35,690
I even missed something.

7801
08:20:41,930 --> 08:20:43,530
I can break it with the gun.

7802
08:20:45,450 --> 08:20:46,350
There we go.

7803
08:20:46,550 --> 08:20:46,830
Perfect.

7804
08:20:52,580 --> 08:20:53,900
Flirt with the chain.

7805
08:20:55,800 --> 08:20:57,560
I love the way you...

7806
08:20:58,620 --> 08:20:59,880
link together.

7807
08:21:00,320 --> 08:21:02,720
Your big bulky...

7808
08:21:04,560 --> 08:21:05,200
steel...

7809
08:21:05,200 --> 08:21:06,000
Something.

7810
08:21:06,400 --> 08:21:07,840
I don't know what you're made out of.

7811
08:21:09,200 --> 08:21:09,840
Bye!

7812
08:21:10,340 --> 08:21:11,420
Alright, there we go.

7813
08:21:21,340 --> 08:21:23,240
And that here.

7814
08:21:26,380 --> 08:21:27,180
No, come on.

7815
08:21:28,480 --> 08:21:29,600
There we go.

7816
08:21:29,780 --> 08:21:30,260
Good job.

7817
08:21:32,220 --> 08:21:33,240
What's in here?

7818
08:21:34,420 --> 08:21:36,040
I've been rewarded?

7819
08:21:37,440 --> 08:21:38,260
For my bravery?

7820
08:21:39,400 --> 08:21:40,320
Comic book!

7821
08:21:42,600 --> 08:21:43,380
Wow!

7822
08:21:46,240 --> 08:21:47,200
Yeah!

7823
08:21:49,160 --> 08:21:50,480
The terrible thing from below!

7824
08:21:54,600 --> 08:21:55,740
That's true.

7825
08:21:56,220 --> 08:21:57,820
That is absolutely true.

7826
08:22:01,680 --> 08:22:03,180
My own gun.

7827
08:22:03,180 --> 08:22:06,980
I do quite forget often that I have my own gun.

7828
08:22:08,880 --> 08:22:09,640
Ok.

7829
08:22:10,020 --> 08:22:10,820
The chain.

7830
08:22:11,600 --> 08:22:12,900
This is the chain.

7831
08:22:13,480 --> 08:22:14,500
I'll be the chain.

7832
08:22:15,460 --> 08:22:16,640
Yank the chain!

7833
08:22:24,280 --> 08:22:26,400
We can do that?

7834
08:22:29,160 --> 08:22:30,320
How did that work?

7835
08:22:37,600 --> 08:22:38,800
How did that work?

7836
08:22:39,700 --> 08:22:40,540
And from here?

7837
08:22:46,860 --> 08:22:48,600
Oh, I think we're going to get separated.

7838
08:22:51,320 --> 08:22:54,740
Oh, nevermind.

7839
08:22:54,840 --> 08:22:55,700
We're not going to get separated.

7840
08:22:55,800 --> 08:22:56,260
We're fine.

7841
08:22:57,860 --> 08:22:58,780
Whip 2 OP.

7842
08:22:59,840 --> 08:23:00,400
Hold on.

7843
08:23:00,620 --> 08:23:00,840
Gina?

7844
08:23:01,680 --> 08:23:03,040
I'm trapped over here.

7845
08:23:03,140 --> 08:23:03,500
There we go.

7846
08:23:05,420 --> 08:23:06,840
Whip is god level.

7847
08:23:07,320 --> 08:23:09,740
Why do you think Indiana Jones uses it all the time?

7848
08:23:15,640 --> 08:23:21,480
At least it won't have the anchor pulling down the ship on the edge now, right?

7849
08:23:21,680 --> 08:23:21,840
Maybe.

7850
08:23:24,280 --> 08:23:25,620
So we're going out?

7851
08:23:25,720 --> 08:23:26,500
Why are we doing that?

7852
08:23:38,000 --> 08:23:39,480
Why am I crouching?

7853
08:23:39,620 --> 08:23:40,060
Come on.

7854
08:23:41,140 --> 08:23:42,960
Oh, you think he's on the escape boat?

7855
08:23:43,040 --> 08:23:43,880
That would be so funny.

7856
08:23:45,880 --> 08:23:49,860
If the captain was on the life boat.

7857
08:23:50,580 --> 08:23:51,620
Or not the life boat, you know.

7858
08:23:56,920 --> 08:23:57,400
Yup.

7859
08:23:58,000 --> 08:23:59,900
Let's keep going.

7860
08:24:01,040 --> 08:24:01,520
Yup.

7861
08:24:01,940 --> 08:24:02,840
Let's keep going.

7862
08:24:03,900 --> 08:24:04,320
Yeah.

7863
08:24:06,280 --> 08:24:07,160
Life boat is right?

7864
08:24:07,280 --> 08:24:07,880
Oh, I was right?

7865
08:24:08,040 --> 08:24:08,180
Ok.

7866
08:24:08,600 --> 08:24:08,940
Thank you.

7867
08:24:09,900 --> 08:24:12,080
Sometimes I feel like I get things confused.

7868
08:24:12,880 --> 08:24:14,560
I get terminologies confused.

7869
08:24:31,040 --> 08:24:31,460
Push!

7870
08:24:53,380 --> 08:24:55,340
I'm so glad I remembered.

7871
08:25:00,210 --> 08:25:02,070
I can't believe it's an achievement.

7872
08:25:02,230 --> 08:25:02,750
That's hilarious.

7873
08:25:04,530 --> 08:25:07,610
Wow, that's such a good sound of the...

7874
08:25:13,010 --> 08:25:14,630
Can I push this guy?

7875
08:25:16,490 --> 08:25:16,930
Push!

7876
08:25:22,490 --> 08:25:23,210
Is

7877
08:25:48,580 --> 08:25:49,700
Gina down?

7878
08:25:50,060 --> 08:25:50,400
No!

7879
08:25:53,630 --> 08:25:54,970
Oh god, it's this guy.

7880
08:25:55,130 --> 08:25:55,990
I hate this guy.

7881
08:25:56,610 --> 08:25:57,150
You suck!

7882
08:25:57,410 --> 08:25:58,050
You suck!

7883
08:25:58,370 --> 08:25:59,170
You suck!

7884
08:26:00,370 --> 08:26:00,850
No!

7885
08:26:01,110 --> 08:26:01,750
You push!

7886
08:26:01,970 --> 08:26:02,550
Push you!

7887
08:26:02,770 --> 08:26:03,230
Push you!

7888
08:26:09,200 --> 08:26:10,000
You alright?

7889
08:26:11,480 --> 08:26:12,480
We got it.

7890
08:26:12,760 --> 08:26:13,600
We're fine everybody.

7891
08:26:14,200 --> 08:26:14,860
Don't worry.

7892
08:26:22,080 --> 08:26:23,200
Everything's ok.

7893
08:26:24,860 --> 08:26:25,400
Probably.

7894
08:26:28,780 --> 08:26:29,320
Nice.

7895
08:26:30,320 --> 08:26:31,480
I tried to push that guy.

7896
08:26:31,720 --> 08:26:32,560
Didn't really work.

7897
08:26:42,760 --> 08:26:46,520
More bodies for Everest to eat.

7898
08:26:48,400 --> 08:26:48,920
Photo?

7899
08:26:52,270 --> 08:26:53,430
What am I taking a photo?

7900
08:26:53,530 --> 08:26:54,170
Oh, life boat.

7901
08:27:00,230 --> 08:27:01,790
Maybe he's on it.

7902
08:27:03,430 --> 08:27:05,730
Wow, it looks like it's starting to clear up though.

7903
08:27:07,830 --> 08:27:09,690
Mint brought a pipe to a gunfight and won.

7904
08:27:10,190 --> 08:27:11,370
Hell yeah I did.

7905
08:27:13,230 --> 08:27:16,510
Gosh, I really am appreciative of how...

7906
08:27:17,350 --> 08:27:21,490
I don't need games to hold my hand entirely.

7907
08:27:22,710 --> 08:27:24,050
You know, obviously.

7908
08:27:24,530 --> 08:27:26,230
But it is nice that if they're just like...

7909
08:27:26,230 --> 08:27:29,590
If you need to know where to go next, we got you.

7910
08:27:32,270 --> 08:27:34,490
Ok, well there's nothing else around here so...

7911
08:27:36,130 --> 08:27:37,090
I won!

7912
08:27:39,750 --> 08:27:40,810
It's a fair game.

7913
08:27:44,600 --> 08:27:45,080
Wow.

7914
08:27:46,640 --> 08:27:47,220
I see.

7915
08:27:48,280 --> 08:27:49,620
I see, I see, I see.

7916
08:27:51,000 --> 08:27:52,840
I see, I see, I see.

7917
08:27:56,480 --> 08:27:57,060
Ok.

7918
08:28:04,600 --> 08:28:05,380
Back up!

7919
08:28:05,420 --> 08:28:05,760
Back up!

7920
08:28:05,800 --> 08:28:06,080
Gina!

7921
08:28:06,540 --> 08:28:07,740
He's gonna turn around.

7922
08:28:08,000 --> 08:28:08,720
Oh, there she goes.

7923
08:28:12,580 --> 08:28:14,760
He's right there.

7924
08:28:18,480 --> 08:28:19,640
Holy shit.

7925
08:28:20,360 --> 08:28:20,780
Girl.

7926
08:28:20,780 --> 08:28:20,980
Girl.

7927
08:28:30,260 --> 08:28:32,910
Oh my god, I can't with her.

7928
08:28:42,480 --> 08:28:43,680
Oh, I got him.

7929
08:28:46,370 --> 08:28:47,580
I'm better than that guy.

7930
08:28:48,220 --> 08:28:48,660
Oh, document.

7931
08:28:49,920 --> 08:28:50,920
Experiment journal!

7932
08:28:51,140 --> 08:28:52,080
Oh yes!

7933
08:28:53,340 --> 08:28:55,500
Experiment delta circle zero.

7934
08:28:57,080 --> 08:28:57,760
Location.

7935
08:28:57,940 --> 08:29:00,560
Off the coast of Peru, 50 kilometers west of Lima.

7936
08:29:00,940 --> 08:29:01,500
Log written.

7937
08:29:06,280 --> 08:29:07,480
Purpose of experiment.

7938
08:29:07,660 --> 08:29:12,940
To gauge any intrinsic powers within the great circle artifact stone.

7939
08:29:13,540 --> 08:29:16,360
Discovered during the Machu Picchu expedition 1937.

7940
08:29:17,760 --> 08:29:18,440
Account.

7941
08:29:18,780 --> 08:29:20,580
Present are myself, Dr. Laura.

7942
08:29:21,000 --> 08:29:22,060
Her sister.

7943
08:29:22,700 --> 08:29:24,040
And Captain Conrad.

7944
08:29:25,500 --> 08:29:28,640
Together with the crew of KMS Comet.

7945
08:29:29,840 --> 08:29:30,500
Oh, oh!

7946
08:29:30,840 --> 08:29:35,920
Emmerich Voss observes the experiment from a nearby ship along with the other expedition members.

7947
08:29:36,400 --> 08:29:40,440
Everyone is gathered around the stone, which has been placed on a makeshift pedestal.

7948
08:29:41,580 --> 08:29:45,940
Dr. Lombardi objects once again to the experiment being conducted in this manner.

7949
08:29:47,040 --> 08:29:54,620
Citing the speculative nature of her compiled syllabary and the lack of theoretical understanding of potential risks.

7950
08:29:54,620 --> 08:29:57,540
She considers the experiment to be reckless and dangerous.

7951
08:29:58,780 --> 08:30:04,640
Well, we know that it was hops... hops... hops... hopskitch.

7952
08:30:06,400 --> 08:30:07,020
Hopskitch.

7953
08:30:10,540 --> 08:30:11,900
Yes, she wasn't wrong.

7954
08:30:13,880 --> 08:30:20,200
The captain reminds Dr. Lombardi that it is just a rock, not to waste his time.

7955
08:30:20,640 --> 08:30:23,690
He further emphasizes that she will have to answer to hopskitch.

7956
08:30:24,830 --> 08:30:26,970
Voss, if she does not follow his orders.

7957
08:30:27,510 --> 08:30:31,590
After a brief discussion, Dr. Lombardi reluctantly agrees to proceed with the experiment.

7958
08:30:31,910 --> 08:30:35,690
She takes the stone in her left hand, holds it up and begins to document.

7959
08:30:37,470 --> 08:30:38,290
Ends abruptly.

7960
08:30:42,490 --> 08:30:43,690
She began to...

7961
08:30:46,490 --> 08:30:48,750
Fortnite emo all over the place.

7962
08:30:48,750 --> 08:30:49,470
I'm not sure.

7963
08:30:55,270 --> 08:30:56,190
Unrelated, sorry.

7964
08:30:56,410 --> 08:30:58,270
I just got the notification that my happy is shipping soon.

7965
08:31:00,650 --> 08:31:02,710
They've been working on shipping the happy.

7966
08:31:09,360 --> 08:31:11,080
Where am I supposed to go?

7967
08:31:12,460 --> 08:31:14,240
Oh, right over here.

7968
08:31:16,480 --> 08:31:17,000
Nice.

7969
08:31:18,680 --> 08:31:19,180
What's this?

7970
08:31:19,560 --> 08:31:20,080
A sketch.

7971
08:31:22,020 --> 08:31:22,360
Of...

7972
08:31:35,280 --> 08:31:37,180
It's a sketch of Mickey!

7973
08:31:39,880 --> 08:31:41,000
Mayan sketch.

7974
08:31:41,140 --> 08:31:46,220
Sketch of a Mayan statue presumably found before the Peru exposition.

7975
08:31:49,020 --> 08:31:50,240
Oh my god.

7976
08:31:50,380 --> 08:31:51,220
Oh, this is a bed.

7977
08:31:55,560 --> 08:31:59,980
I didn't expect him to be so... round.

7978
08:32:00,840 --> 08:32:02,200
I don't know.

7979
08:32:03,820 --> 08:32:04,860
Oh, golly.

7980
08:32:06,120 --> 08:32:06,640
Oh, wait.

7981
08:32:06,800 --> 08:32:07,480
I'm full health.

7982
08:32:07,560 --> 08:32:07,980
Just kidding.

7983
08:32:11,260 --> 08:32:12,300
Straight goblin.

7984
08:32:15,730 --> 08:32:17,150
Is this the captain?

7985
08:32:17,850 --> 08:32:18,150
No.

7986
08:32:19,370 --> 08:32:20,050
Where am I?

7987
08:32:20,310 --> 08:32:21,190
Am I in the right place?

7988
08:32:22,230 --> 08:32:22,750
Close.

7989
08:32:23,290 --> 08:32:24,450
I think I need to go upstairs.

7990
08:32:28,150 --> 08:32:29,110
Anything over here?

7991
08:32:32,790 --> 08:32:33,550
Alright, upstairs.

7992
08:32:35,430 --> 08:32:37,910
Maybe I will never understand why Laura was here.

7993
08:32:39,170 --> 08:32:42,390
But at least I can try to stop Voss from getting the stone.

7994
08:32:43,670 --> 08:32:44,170
Yeah.

7995
08:32:45,230 --> 08:32:46,150
We'll stop him.

7996
08:32:47,590 --> 08:32:47,850
Maybe.

7997
08:32:48,110 --> 08:32:48,510
I don't know.

7998
08:32:48,710 --> 08:32:52,370
They have more... There's only two of us and like a lot of them.

7999
08:32:53,210 --> 08:32:54,110
Officer Lounge!

8000
08:32:57,990 --> 08:32:59,910
I think Jogham is the captain.

8001
08:33:00,650 --> 08:33:01,310
Oh, just kidding.

8002
08:33:02,770 --> 08:33:05,890
All the letter combinations have been crossed out.

8003
08:33:09,970 --> 08:33:11,030
Just kidding.

8004
08:33:13,070 --> 08:33:13,750
Wow!

8005
08:33:15,730 --> 08:33:17,430
I like how it glistens.

8006
08:33:17,510 --> 08:33:18,090
It's so pretty.

8007
08:33:20,970 --> 08:33:21,930
Code wheel.

8008
08:33:23,610 --> 08:33:25,050
I think we know what to do.

8009
08:33:28,270 --> 08:33:29,610
What do you mean nothing?

8010
08:33:37,420 --> 08:33:37,980
I'm trying!

8011
08:33:42,740 --> 08:33:43,300
Oh, baby.

8012
08:33:45,080 --> 08:33:49,060
Everybody put 4, 5, 7, 1 in the chat.

8013
08:33:50,020 --> 08:33:51,140
Oh my gosh.

8014
08:33:51,660 --> 08:33:53,940
I love it when you call me 4, 5, 7, 1.

8015
08:33:59,890 --> 08:34:00,450
Better baby!

8016
08:34:02,170 --> 08:34:03,090
Oh my gosh.

8017
08:34:03,190 --> 08:34:04,170
4, 5, 7, 1.

8018
08:34:04,250 --> 08:34:05,010
4, 5, 7, 1.

8019
08:34:05,070 --> 08:34:05,750
4, 5, 7, 1.

8020
08:34:08,930 --> 08:34:09,690
4, 5, 7, 1.

8021
08:34:09,750 --> 08:34:10,330
4, 5, 7, 1.

8022
08:34:10,370 --> 08:34:10,970
4, 5, 7, 1.

8023
08:34:10,990 --> 08:34:11,750
4, 5, 7, 1.

8024
08:34:17,580 --> 08:34:19,080
Are these numbers here?

8025
08:34:19,640 --> 08:34:20,440
No, they are letters.

8026
08:34:26,400 --> 08:34:26,640
J.

8027
08:34:26,640 --> 08:34:27,380
Can I change it?

8028
08:34:33,970 --> 08:34:35,550
Hey, 4, 5, 7, 1.

8029
08:34:35,650 --> 08:34:36,830
You come here often?

8030
08:34:38,410 --> 08:34:38,930
What's this?

8031
08:34:39,890 --> 08:34:42,690
Viewers are discussing a streamer named Mint and their drawing of a goblin.

8032
08:34:42,870 --> 08:34:45,230
They are commenting on its resemblance to the streamer.

8033
08:34:46,010 --> 08:34:48,310
It's cuteness and how it looks like a goblin.

8034
08:34:52,230 --> 08:34:53,390
Oh wait, there is another note.

8035
08:34:53,550 --> 08:34:54,310
Oh there is more notes.

8036
08:34:55,310 --> 08:34:56,250
We haven't found everything.

8037
08:34:56,330 --> 08:34:56,990
Oh there is more!

8038
08:35:00,310 --> 08:35:01,090
What's in here?

8039
08:35:01,690 --> 08:35:02,010
Boot?

8040
08:35:03,830 --> 08:35:04,190
Boot.

8041
08:35:04,190 --> 08:35:07,670
Boot, boot, boot.

8042
08:35:07,670 --> 08:35:08,410
Captain's journal.

8043
08:35:08,830 --> 08:35:17,050
This is the final message of Conrad Aldrichter, captain of the KMS Comet.

8044
08:35:17,670 --> 08:35:19,230
We are God knows where.

8045
08:35:19,770 --> 08:35:22,150
Yes, God really is the only one who does.

8046
08:35:22,690 --> 08:35:30,170
After the event happened, after witnessing the unleashing of untold powers trapped within that stone, I ran after that Lombardi woman and grabbed the stone from her.

8047
08:35:30,170 --> 08:35:33,470
I realized it belongs to the fatherland.

8048
08:35:34,250 --> 08:35:35,590
It must be protected.

8049
08:35:35,930 --> 08:35:40,910
That's why I have decided to lock myself inside the safe room with the stone.

8050
08:35:41,570 --> 08:35:43,030
Shut up Gina!

8051
08:35:43,370 --> 08:35:44,330
Shut up!

8052
08:35:45,850 --> 08:35:48,990
I will try to recreate what that damned woman did to trigger the event.

8053
08:35:49,270 --> 08:35:50,210
I pray it will work.

8054
08:35:50,410 --> 08:35:52,630
But if it doesn't...

8055
08:35:52,630 --> 08:35:55,490
This message is to the rescue team that finds this note.

8056
08:35:55,690 --> 08:35:58,170
I have written down the code for unlocking the safe door.

8057
08:35:58,170 --> 08:36:00,630
You will know what to do with it.

8058
08:36:00,850 --> 08:36:07,090
If I am dead when you find me, return the stone to the Fuhrer and tell him I gave my life protecting it.

8059
08:36:11,830 --> 08:36:12,170
Then here.

8060
08:36:15,510 --> 08:36:16,250
What was it?

8061
08:36:17,530 --> 08:36:18,810
Oh, the combination.

8062
08:36:20,530 --> 08:36:21,190
Hold on.

8063
08:36:22,910 --> 08:36:26,190
So it was J...

8064
08:36:28,950 --> 08:36:30,350
4571.

8065
08:36:32,190 --> 08:36:33,450
It's baby!

8066
08:36:35,110 --> 08:36:37,050
It's gotta be baby!

8067
08:36:39,250 --> 08:36:41,330
Gina, you are... Please.

8068
08:36:41,930 --> 08:36:42,850
Please, can you...

8069
08:36:42,850 --> 08:36:44,770
She's traveling through space and time.

8070
08:36:44,890 --> 08:36:48,110
She can't chill out even for a moment's notice.

8071
08:36:48,450 --> 08:36:52,430
She literally phased out of existence because she just can't chill.

8072
08:36:54,490 --> 08:36:56,470
Oh my god!

8073
08:36:57,950 --> 08:36:58,630
Girl!

8074
08:36:58,630 --> 08:36:58,730
Girl!

8075
08:37:01,830 --> 08:37:02,630
J...

8076
08:37:03,630 --> 08:37:04,030
GM.

8077
08:37:04,650 --> 08:37:05,330
J...

8078
08:37:05,330 --> 08:37:06,490
GM.

8079
08:37:06,730 --> 08:37:08,910
J was... I saw it in here.

8080
08:37:10,410 --> 08:37:12,630
I thought... Maybe not.

8081
08:37:12,830 --> 08:37:13,210
Hold on.

8082
08:37:14,530 --> 08:37:15,330
GM.

8083
08:37:15,670 --> 08:37:16,790
Oh, the O is 8.

8084
08:37:18,490 --> 08:37:19,890
O is 8.

8085
08:37:21,870 --> 08:37:23,470
And G...

8086
08:37:23,470 --> 08:37:24,790
is 2.

8087
08:37:25,630 --> 08:37:27,490
And M is 4.

8088
08:37:32,360 --> 08:37:33,560
It's not 1 to 1?

8089
08:37:34,940 --> 08:37:35,540
That's not it?

8090
08:37:38,420 --> 08:37:41,420
You need to do the cipher to find the right code.

8091
08:37:42,100 --> 08:37:42,540
Okay.

8092
08:37:53,980 --> 08:37:54,420
Hints.

8093
08:37:55,960 --> 08:37:56,860
What does it say?

8094
08:37:56,980 --> 08:37:58,180
Actually, I've never tried the hints.

8095
08:37:58,260 --> 08:37:58,880
What does it say?

8096
08:38:00,000 --> 08:38:01,080
Is it in the journal?

8097
08:38:02,760 --> 08:38:03,600
Where's the hints?

8098
08:38:04,660 --> 08:38:05,660
Where's the hints at?

8099
08:38:06,080 --> 08:38:06,480
Hints?

8100
08:38:06,880 --> 08:38:07,280
Hints!

8101
08:38:08,300 --> 08:38:11,100
Oh my god, 45% of fieldwork.

8102
08:38:11,240 --> 08:38:13,900
I'm not even halfway through!

8103
08:38:14,740 --> 08:38:16,000
You've got to be kidding me.

8104
08:38:17,060 --> 08:38:18,460
You've got to be squidding me.

8105
08:38:21,100 --> 08:38:22,200
Close the machine?

8106
08:38:22,740 --> 08:38:23,800
How do you do that?

8107
08:38:24,540 --> 08:38:25,520
What do you mean close it?

8108
08:38:28,070 --> 08:38:29,860
I just noticed it.

8109
08:38:38,760 --> 08:38:39,380
J...

8110
08:38:40,980 --> 08:38:41,660
Happy.

8111
08:38:45,580 --> 08:38:46,260
J...

8112
08:38:49,220 --> 08:38:49,900
M.

8113
08:38:56,640 --> 08:38:57,200
I did it.

8114
08:39:01,480 --> 08:39:02,600
Spell boob.

8115
08:39:03,140 --> 08:39:03,480
No!

8116
08:39:04,700 --> 08:39:05,080
Blut.

8117
08:39:11,790 --> 08:39:12,870
To read it.

8118
08:39:12,930 --> 08:39:13,350
Read what?

8119
08:39:14,190 --> 08:39:15,070
Oh is it blut?

8120
08:39:15,850 --> 08:39:17,430
Is that what the code is?

8121
08:39:19,970 --> 08:39:20,810
Bald.

8122
08:39:22,170 --> 08:39:23,010
2026?

8123
08:39:23,550 --> 08:39:24,470
Oh no!

8124
08:39:25,190 --> 08:39:26,130
Is that a prediction?

8125
08:39:35,820 --> 08:39:36,660
Wait.

8126
08:39:36,660 --> 08:39:37,500
3666.

8127
08:39:38,440 --> 08:39:39,500
I found it.

8128
08:39:42,420 --> 08:39:43,700
This guy is freaky deaky.

8129
08:39:58,960 --> 08:40:00,820
Do you think this guy is still alive?

8130
08:40:02,800 --> 08:40:03,720
Oh my god.

8131
08:40:03,800 --> 08:40:05,080
I can already see what it is.

8132
08:40:05,520 --> 08:40:05,840
No way.

8133
08:40:05,900 --> 08:40:07,040
It's another Mayan drawing.

8134
08:40:13,260 --> 08:40:14,700
Look at his face.

8135
08:40:15,220 --> 08:40:16,220
He's like...

8136
08:40:16,220 --> 08:40:19,800
He looks so satisfied.

8137
08:40:23,560 --> 08:40:25,120
Machu Picchu.

8138
08:40:25,160 --> 08:40:29,500
All of this were stones.

8139
08:40:29,700 --> 08:40:30,140
So true.

8140
08:40:34,620 --> 08:40:36,700
He's literally feeling himself.

8141
08:40:37,400 --> 08:40:38,760
We love that for him.

8142
08:40:42,980 --> 08:40:44,100
The nose.

8143
08:40:44,340 --> 08:40:44,480
No.

8144
08:40:47,400 --> 08:40:49,280
Probably the stone, Gina.

8145
08:40:49,440 --> 08:40:50,400
My god.

8146
08:40:51,380 --> 08:40:53,240
I thought there was going to be a cutscene or something.

8147
08:40:56,540 --> 08:40:57,380
Oh my god.

8148
08:40:57,420 --> 08:40:58,920
It's so frosty in here.

8149
08:40:59,220 --> 08:41:01,040
It's so frosty in here.

8150
08:41:02,620 --> 08:41:04,480
I don't think that...

8151
08:41:05,220 --> 08:41:07,060
That's some nasty frostbite.

8152
08:41:07,060 --> 08:41:12,280
What does it say?

8153
08:41:12,480 --> 08:41:14,580
Oh his hair is bleaching in and out.

8154
08:41:16,060 --> 08:41:17,480
Oh the hair textures.

8155
08:41:25,210 --> 08:41:26,130
Oh no!

8156
08:41:27,730 --> 08:41:28,450
Just people.

8157
08:41:33,470 --> 08:41:35,090
But we need the stone.

8158
08:41:36,290 --> 08:41:36,550
Jump.

8159
08:41:36,550 --> 08:41:37,710
Be right there.

8160
08:41:48,690 --> 08:41:49,410
Nachos.

8161
08:41:51,190 --> 08:41:52,550
We got just one guy.

8162
08:41:52,650 --> 08:41:53,190
We can take him.

8163
08:41:56,450 --> 08:41:59,550
I've taken down three guys together.

8164
08:42:09,690 --> 08:42:10,470
Come on.

8165
08:42:10,530 --> 08:42:11,310
Just take it.

8166
08:42:13,990 --> 08:42:15,050
Come on, Indy!

8167
08:42:16,070 --> 08:42:17,150
What's happening?

8168
08:42:20,890 --> 08:42:24,410
Went to have an early X-mas dinner five hours ago and you're still screaming?

8169
08:42:24,550 --> 08:42:25,790
I like this game.

8170
08:42:27,170 --> 08:42:29,830
I would love some mac and cheese.

8171
08:42:34,330 --> 08:42:34,810
Noise.

8172
08:42:41,770 --> 08:42:42,250
We've

8173
08:42:45,530 --> 08:42:45,910
got it.

8174
08:42:46,090 --> 08:42:46,530
What's that?

8175
08:42:46,810 --> 08:42:47,350
What does that say?

8176
08:42:54,290 --> 08:42:56,190
Put it in your pocket.

8177
08:42:57,670 --> 08:42:58,610
Not

8178
08:43:07,940 --> 08:43:09,120
all the guys are like him.

8179
08:43:11,040 --> 08:43:12,320
Who shot?

8180
08:43:14,060 --> 08:43:15,500
Who shot gun?

8181
08:43:18,620 --> 08:43:20,500
It's probably...

8182
08:43:21,320 --> 08:43:21,920
Sid.

8183
08:43:22,380 --> 08:43:24,120
Final Fantasy 7.

8184
08:43:27,240 --> 08:43:28,560
Oh man.

8185
08:43:47,180 --> 08:43:47,660
Okay.

8186
08:43:50,120 --> 08:43:50,920
Who's that?

8187
08:43:51,020 --> 08:43:52,000
It's another baddie.

8188
08:43:52,400 --> 08:43:53,000
It's a guy.

8189
08:43:58,480 --> 08:44:00,040
Why did she look at the stone for a moment?

8190
08:44:00,260 --> 08:44:02,240
She looked like...

8191
08:44:03,400 --> 08:44:06,360
She looked like Gollum taking the ring.

8192
08:44:08,280 --> 08:44:11,260
I wonder if she is going to betray us.

8193
08:44:11,540 --> 08:44:13,740
These guys with these masks are so freaky.

8194
08:44:15,340 --> 08:44:16,560
Are we in trouble?

8195
08:44:20,850 --> 08:44:21,950
What are you going to do?

8196
08:44:24,610 --> 08:44:28,750
She's been kind of sus a couple of times.

8197
08:44:36,770 --> 08:44:38,170
Indy, when did you...

8198
08:44:41,550 --> 08:44:42,550
Höhenangst.

8199
08:44:42,770 --> 08:44:43,090
What's that?

8200
08:44:46,430 --> 08:44:47,430
Höhenangst.

8201
08:45:17,240 --> 08:45:19,300
He looks so cute in his little hat.

8202
08:45:24,360 --> 08:45:25,980
Hey Gantz, I have an Oshie.

8203
08:45:26,120 --> 08:45:26,320
Okay?

8204
08:45:27,760 --> 08:45:30,140
I know what devotion is.

8205
08:45:46,130 --> 08:45:47,380
You have no history.

8206
08:45:47,700 --> 08:45:48,260
No nation.

8207
08:45:48,620 --> 08:45:49,600
No leader.

8208
08:45:49,940 --> 08:45:51,640
I can't show devotion to hamburgers?

8209
08:45:56,680 --> 08:45:57,340
Cowabunga!

8210
08:46:02,160 --> 08:46:03,840
You laugh and dance.

8211
08:46:04,120 --> 08:46:07,240
Celebrating your own idiocy and drinking the piss you call beer.

8212
08:46:08,140 --> 08:46:08,580
Oh.

8213
08:46:12,820 --> 08:46:13,860
Push him down.

8214
08:46:14,120 --> 08:46:14,740
Just kick him.

8215
08:46:15,000 --> 08:46:16,380
Indy, just kick him and he'll fall down.

8216
08:46:22,400 --> 08:46:23,920
He's going to cause an avalanche.

8217
08:46:24,040 --> 08:46:24,940
I'm scared.

8218
08:46:29,880 --> 08:46:31,160
Yeah, American beer called out.

8219
08:46:31,160 --> 08:46:31,640
Wow.

8220
08:46:35,160 --> 08:46:36,540
Blue eyed person meme.

8221
08:46:38,660 --> 08:46:39,640
Is he crying?

8222
08:46:45,160 --> 08:46:50,360
The voice acting in this game is so... I feel like I'm watching an Indiana Jones movie sometimes.

8223
08:46:55,440 --> 08:46:57,340
Like I feel like I'm watching an actual movie.

8224
08:47:01,160 --> 08:47:01,880
Give me the stone.

8225
08:47:05,620 --> 08:47:06,040
Gina,

8226
08:47:10,010 --> 08:47:10,910
I hope you have a plan.

8227
08:47:28,870 --> 08:47:29,710
A potato!

8228
08:47:33,230 --> 08:47:33,830
Oh no.

8229
08:47:34,050 --> 08:47:35,770
Okay, now that's going to cause an avalanche.

8230
08:47:36,310 --> 08:47:37,410
Oh god, the granada.

8231
08:47:37,410 --> 08:47:37,450
Granada.

8232
08:47:46,050 --> 08:47:48,130
Put it in your pocket.

8233
08:47:49,010 --> 08:47:50,010
Put it in your bra.

8234
08:47:50,530 --> 08:47:52,210
Put it in your bra, Gina!

8235
08:47:52,530 --> 08:47:54,210
The safest place!

8236
08:47:54,690 --> 08:47:55,170
Gina!

8237
08:47:55,670 --> 08:47:57,630
Put the stone in your bra!

8238
08:48:06,930 --> 08:48:08,990
Get in the lifeboat.

8239
08:48:12,270 --> 08:48:13,310
Oh my god.

8240
08:48:13,370 --> 08:48:13,950
I told you!

8241
08:48:15,690 --> 08:48:16,090
Gina.

8242
08:48:17,230 --> 08:48:17,630
Gina!

8243
08:48:19,870 --> 08:48:21,350
I swear she does this on purpose.

8244
08:48:21,470 --> 08:48:23,410
Oh my gosh, what if it went down the little drain?

8245
08:48:50,070 --> 08:48:55,570
I was literally... You guys, I was literally just thinking, oh my gosh, what if they did a wheelhouse game there?

8246
08:48:56,310 --> 08:48:57,110
No way!

8247
08:48:59,350 --> 08:49:00,930
Oh my god!

8248
08:49:01,730 --> 08:49:03,610
They actually did it!

8249
08:49:12,950 --> 08:49:14,350
It's so great.

8250
08:49:17,980 --> 08:49:18,800
Oh, next.

8251
08:49:24,560 --> 08:49:26,100
This is so insane.

8252
08:49:27,920 --> 08:49:28,980
Oh my god.

8253
08:49:36,140 --> 08:49:37,280
Oh my god.

8254
08:49:37,620 --> 08:49:39,140
Okay, I'm going.

8255
08:49:39,620 --> 08:49:40,200
Somehow.

8256
08:49:40,900 --> 08:49:41,660
Hold on.

8257
08:49:42,060 --> 08:49:43,240
I'm going to the back of the ship.

8258
08:49:43,900 --> 08:49:44,540
I'll get there.

8259
08:49:44,540 --> 08:49:45,700
Oh, I see it.

8260
08:49:57,950 --> 08:49:59,210
Okay, I made it.

8261
08:50:00,750 --> 08:50:01,930
I'm jumping here.

8262
08:50:02,630 --> 08:50:03,250
Oh, what?

8263
08:50:05,290 --> 08:50:06,090
Just kidding.

8264
08:50:06,170 --> 08:50:07,430
You were not supposed to jump there.

8265
08:50:08,850 --> 08:50:10,650
You were supposed to jump...

8266
08:50:12,470 --> 08:50:13,030
Here.

8267
08:50:14,830 --> 08:50:15,150
Nope.

8268
08:50:18,030 --> 08:50:19,650
You were supposed to jump...

8269
08:50:20,650 --> 08:50:21,170
Okay.

8270
08:50:21,470 --> 08:50:22,710
I tried before.

8271
08:50:23,430 --> 08:50:26,030
It just didn't let me, so...

8272
08:50:26,030 --> 08:50:27,510
Now I'm supposed to jump.

8273
08:50:37,510 --> 08:50:39,830
The devs understood the assignment.

8274
08:50:40,630 --> 08:50:41,970
Yeah, it's so funny.

8275
08:50:42,690 --> 08:50:45,730
Gosh, I really... I can't believe how much I was just thinking that.

8276
08:50:46,830 --> 08:50:47,670
Okay, nope.

8277
08:50:48,810 --> 08:50:50,010
You're supposed to jump.

8278
08:50:51,750 --> 08:50:53,730
Oh wait, you're supposed to jump here.

8279
08:50:53,730 --> 08:50:56,150
And then you're supposed to jump.

8280
08:50:57,010 --> 08:50:57,490
Look up.

8281
08:50:57,570 --> 08:50:58,350
Oh, it's right there.

8282
08:50:58,430 --> 08:50:59,470
I was looking at that thing.

8283
08:50:59,610 --> 08:50:59,750
Okay.

8284
08:51:02,310 --> 08:51:03,150
Climb up.

8285
08:51:05,630 --> 08:51:06,530
Climb up.

8286
08:51:06,950 --> 08:51:08,170
And then over.

8287
08:51:09,230 --> 08:51:09,790
Over.

8288
08:51:10,570 --> 08:51:10,990
Over.

8289
08:51:12,290 --> 08:51:13,130
Oh my god.

8290
08:51:18,420 --> 08:51:18,980
Cheetah!

8291
08:51:24,300 --> 08:51:25,960
That was so great.

8292
08:51:26,800 --> 08:51:28,860
This game is a lot of looking up, huh?

8293
08:51:29,260 --> 08:51:31,040
It's really teaching us gamers a lesson.

8294
08:51:31,220 --> 08:51:31,780
Right everybody?

8295
08:51:32,660 --> 08:51:33,020
X!

8296
08:51:33,980 --> 08:51:34,760
Kill her!

8297
08:51:46,300 --> 08:51:47,500
Oh my god.

8298
08:51:47,600 --> 08:51:51,540
Oh, Gina has become just a little koala upon my back.

8299
08:51:51,900 --> 08:51:52,760
Don't let go.

8300
08:51:52,760 --> 08:51:52,900
Oh!

8301
08:52:09,330 --> 08:52:09,810
Yeah.

8302
08:52:13,930 --> 08:52:15,690
Come on little spider monkey.

8303
08:52:17,970 --> 08:52:19,150
Say the stone.

8304
08:52:20,690 --> 08:52:21,750
Say the stone.

8305
08:52:22,710 --> 08:52:23,390
Read it out.

8306
08:52:32,310 --> 08:52:33,550
Say the stone!

8307
08:52:34,610 --> 08:52:35,050
Oh my god.

8308
08:52:35,110 --> 08:52:35,410
Oh my god.

8309
08:52:35,470 --> 08:52:35,810
Oh my god.

8310
08:52:35,870 --> 08:52:36,270
Oh my god.

8311
08:52:36,270 --> 08:52:37,170
Fold the earth.

8312
08:52:39,390 --> 08:52:39,910
Oh no.

8313
08:52:40,630 --> 08:52:41,210
Gantz?

8314
08:52:43,390 --> 08:52:47,690
I love that boss is not making Gantz do his dirty work.

8315
08:52:54,560 --> 08:52:55,380
Come on.

8316
08:52:55,400 --> 08:52:55,960
Say it.

8317
08:52:56,440 --> 08:52:57,360
Just read it.

8318
08:52:57,360 --> 08:53:00,400
Ich bin unbesiegbar.

8319
08:53:05,120 --> 08:53:07,440
Earth splitter.

8320
08:53:13,960 --> 08:53:15,120
It's

8321
08:53:19,560 --> 08:53:20,720
Adamic.

8322
08:53:21,260 --> 08:53:23,000
We have to say the word in Adamic!

8323
08:53:28,040 --> 08:53:29,200
Utzalaim!

8324
08:53:32,860 --> 08:53:34,780
There it is!

8325
08:53:41,620 --> 08:53:51,750
And then it just rains this all over some poor town in China?

8326
08:53:51,750 --> 08:53:51,930
No!

8327
08:54:11,040 --> 08:54:13,400
Oh my god.

8328
08:54:13,680 --> 08:54:14,480
Oh no!

8329
08:54:15,020 --> 08:54:15,500
Oh no!

8330
08:54:20,140 --> 08:54:24,060
Oh my god!

8331
08:54:25,020 --> 08:54:26,580
That's so messed up!

8332
08:54:26,580 --> 08:54:29,580
And he don't...

8333
08:54:32,800 --> 08:54:37,520
I was gonna say don't like lay down and make it easier for him.

8334
08:54:42,560 --> 08:54:43,760
Wormhole Fulton.

8335
08:54:47,020 --> 08:54:49,520
I don't think we are actually in Shanghai though.

8336
08:54:51,540 --> 08:54:54,520
I think maybe we like... maybe there...

8337
08:54:56,840 --> 08:54:59,320
Maybe like we are in a restaurant or something.

8338
08:55:02,940 --> 08:55:04,680
I don't know.

8339
08:55:04,720 --> 08:55:04,880
Maybe.

8340
08:55:05,080 --> 08:55:05,440
I don't know.

8341
08:55:08,080 --> 08:55:09,140
Yeah, like Chinatown.

8342
08:55:32,030 --> 08:55:34,450
It's looking pretty bad out there.

8343
08:55:34,890 --> 08:55:35,990
That wooden structure.

8344
08:55:36,290 --> 08:55:37,270
Well, I don't know.

8345
08:55:37,450 --> 08:55:37,750
I don't know.

8346
08:55:39,130 --> 08:55:39,330
Maybe.

8347
08:55:39,710 --> 08:55:40,110
I don't know.

8348
08:55:40,470 --> 08:55:42,510
I thought they were like doing a little...

8349
08:55:45,610 --> 08:55:47,510
They were gonna...

8350
08:55:49,350 --> 08:55:52,150
Have us believe one thing and it's actually the other thing.

8351
08:55:58,470 --> 08:55:59,510
Folded the earth.

8352
08:55:59,510 --> 08:56:00,410
Folded the earth.

8353
08:56:02,970 --> 08:56:04,370
It folded the earth.

8354
08:56:09,750 --> 08:56:10,810
Red herring.

8355
08:56:10,910 --> 08:56:11,550
Thank you.

8356
08:56:13,050 --> 08:56:14,990
I can't always remember things.

8357
08:56:17,710 --> 08:56:19,110
Ok, I'm trying.

8358
08:56:21,370 --> 08:56:22,290
Coming up.

8359
08:56:23,170 --> 08:56:24,030
Give me the gamer paint.

8360
08:56:34,460 --> 08:56:34,960
Hello?

8361
08:56:40,920 --> 08:56:42,280
We really are in Shanghai!

8362
08:56:55,300 --> 08:56:59,700
I think so.

8363
08:57:00,560 --> 08:57:01,560
Where is the anchor?

8364
08:57:04,420 --> 08:57:07,120
I guess it really doesn't matter that...

8365
08:57:08,960 --> 08:57:09,320
I don't know.

8366
08:57:09,380 --> 08:57:10,300
You are leading the way.

8367
08:57:14,700 --> 08:57:15,580
Oh my god.

8368
08:57:15,720 --> 08:57:18,620
I guess it doesn't matter that we drop the whole boat on top of everything.

8369
08:57:20,160 --> 08:57:21,840
Because nobody was here, hopefully.

8370
08:57:24,020 --> 08:57:26,120
Ok, hurry up so I can...

8371
08:57:28,680 --> 08:57:29,560
Oh god!

8372
08:57:31,680 --> 08:57:33,180
I don't think we are safe anyway.

8373
08:57:33,720 --> 08:57:37,840
Oh my

8374
08:57:42,470 --> 08:57:42,770
god.

8375
08:57:42,950 --> 08:57:43,190
Hello.

8376
08:57:43,550 --> 08:57:43,910
Are you ok?

8377
08:57:44,310 --> 08:57:45,250
Why do you look like that?

8378
08:57:53,150 --> 08:57:53,750
Oof.

8379
08:57:55,730 --> 08:57:58,750
Yeah, let's all just, you know, we got...

8380
08:58:04,390 --> 08:58:06,690
Oh it's so nice over here!

8381
08:58:09,010 --> 08:58:09,610
Oh!

8382
08:58:11,330 --> 08:58:11,930
Look!

8383
08:58:15,750 --> 08:58:17,230
Yeah, about that.

8384
08:58:17,390 --> 08:58:18,030
Um, Gina.

8385
08:58:19,050 --> 08:58:20,330
Yeah, about that.

8386
08:58:21,090 --> 08:58:21,790
Picture mode?

8387
08:58:21,970 --> 08:58:22,230
Really?

8388
08:58:28,550 --> 08:58:30,170
The old town canal.

8389
08:58:34,550 --> 08:58:35,330
So sad.

8390
08:58:37,990 --> 08:58:38,610
Fish!

8391
08:58:43,170 --> 08:58:45,050
Yeah, it said 1937.

8392
08:58:45,250 --> 08:58:45,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8393
08:58:46,630 --> 08:58:48,530
I'm just gonna take that.

8394
08:58:48,850 --> 08:58:49,730
Oh these look good.

8395
08:58:49,790 --> 08:58:50,930
Indy, take these!

8396
08:58:51,910 --> 08:58:52,430
Indy!

8397
08:58:52,790 --> 08:58:54,950
Indy, there is food all over the place!

8398
08:58:56,370 --> 08:58:57,530
Indy, a feast!

8399
08:59:05,060 --> 08:59:05,840
Who's that?

8400
08:59:12,150 --> 08:59:13,090
What are you?

8401
08:59:15,630 --> 08:59:16,510
Oh my god.

8402
08:59:21,850 --> 08:59:22,390
Hahaha.

8403
08:59:25,430 --> 08:59:27,330
I guess I could have gunned him down, yeah.

8404
08:59:28,170 --> 08:59:29,750
Yeah, I could have gunned him down.

8405
08:59:30,210 --> 08:59:31,490
He was just standing there.

8406
08:59:31,950 --> 08:59:35,010
I didn't know what to do.

8407
08:59:41,070 --> 08:59:41,610
Gosh.

8408
08:59:44,690 --> 08:59:46,010
It's a Raiders reference.

8409
08:59:46,010 --> 08:59:50,150
Yeah, and then I messed it up.

8410
08:59:50,350 --> 08:59:50,470
Sorry.

8411
08:59:55,090 --> 08:59:56,690
Oh we got a map.

8412
08:59:59,550 --> 09:00:00,850
What am I looking at?

8413
09:00:02,490 --> 09:00:02,990
What?

8414
09:00:05,230 --> 09:00:05,730
That?

8415
09:00:07,230 --> 09:00:10,970
You can fly, you can fly, you can fly, you can fly.

8416
09:00:19,250 --> 09:00:19,830
Nice.

8417
09:00:21,290 --> 09:00:23,530
I'd love to continue watching but it's 6AM here.

8418
09:00:23,630 --> 09:00:24,270
No worries!

8419
09:00:24,610 --> 09:00:25,690
Go to sleep!

8420
09:00:31,770 --> 09:00:36,690
I wanted to get to some place a little bit more peaceful.

8421
09:00:40,030 --> 09:00:43,070
Before I stopped...

8422
09:00:43,070 --> 09:00:44,650
I guess I could stop around.

8423
09:00:44,770 --> 09:00:46,430
Let me see when it saves next.

8424
09:00:47,850 --> 09:00:49,030
I'll call it.

8425
09:00:49,810 --> 09:00:51,590
I could still go, but you know.

8426
09:00:52,270 --> 09:00:55,790
I also wanted to play the Astro Bot DLC tomorrow.

8427
09:00:56,470 --> 09:00:58,170
After I did the VR chat.

8428
09:01:01,550 --> 09:01:02,110
So...

8429
09:01:02,690 --> 09:01:03,130
Where?

8430
09:01:08,230 --> 09:01:08,630
Chino!

8431
09:01:09,750 --> 09:01:10,990
Chino, use your words!

8432
09:01:15,900 --> 09:01:17,100
Thanks for having fun with us today, Minto.

8433
09:01:17,220 --> 09:01:17,620
Thank you!

8434
09:01:18,640 --> 09:01:21,660
In fact, Germany was still a supplier and trader of China at this point.

8435
09:01:22,740 --> 09:01:25,480
It was an elite unit of Chinese soldiers.

8436
09:01:26,080 --> 09:01:27,300
Oh, that used German equipment.

8437
09:01:28,100 --> 09:01:29,380
I didn't know that.

8438
09:01:30,240 --> 09:01:32,440
We can go...

8439
09:01:33,260 --> 09:01:34,800
Oh, it sounds so scary.

8440
09:01:39,700 --> 09:01:41,480
Let's jump over here.

8441
09:01:43,800 --> 09:01:46,380
I don't like the sound of the sirens and stuff.

8442
09:01:46,580 --> 09:01:47,100
It scares me.

8443
09:01:48,200 --> 09:01:49,160
So scary.

8444
09:01:50,860 --> 09:01:51,700
I'm late.

8445
09:01:51,780 --> 09:01:52,500
Did I miss anything?

8446
09:01:52,720 --> 09:01:52,980
No!

8447
09:02:01,200 --> 09:02:01,860
Whoopsie!

8448
09:02:03,280 --> 09:02:06,480
I didn't mean to jump up like that!

8449
09:02:08,780 --> 09:02:10,540
Can I go up?

8450
09:02:10,540 --> 09:02:12,220
Gamers, look up!

8451
09:02:12,640 --> 09:02:14,440
Where is the gamer paint?

8452
09:02:15,380 --> 09:02:17,120
Gamer paint, where are you?

8453
09:02:18,840 --> 09:02:19,940
Looks for peace.

8454
09:02:20,040 --> 09:02:21,260
Finds the preludes of war.

8455
09:02:21,440 --> 09:02:21,700
No!

8456
09:02:23,440 --> 09:02:26,060
No, I need to go pet Paz!

8457
09:02:27,280 --> 09:02:31,160
Paz is my angel of peace, except she means war all the time.

8458
09:02:32,000 --> 09:02:33,020
Jump across.

8459
09:02:33,280 --> 09:02:34,340
Can I actually jump this?

8460
09:02:36,000 --> 09:02:37,000
Ok, here we go.

8461
09:02:39,500 --> 09:02:39,900
Oh!

8462
09:02:42,000 --> 09:02:43,900
I just was bad the first time.

8463
09:02:44,900 --> 09:02:45,580
Ok, girl.

8464
09:02:46,640 --> 09:02:47,240
No hands.

8465
09:02:58,900 --> 09:03:00,000
Barely makes it.

8466
09:03:00,160 --> 09:03:01,000
I know, right?

8467
09:03:02,120 --> 09:03:02,880
I'm sorry.

8468
09:03:03,000 --> 09:03:05,440
I know I keep saying, I'm gonna stop, I'm gonna stop, but I can't.

8469
09:03:06,200 --> 09:03:10,220
Physically, I'm just so intrigued and having so much fun with this game.

8470
09:03:11,440 --> 09:03:12,920
Is this how Uncharted is like?

8471
09:03:22,290 --> 09:03:22,730
Yes?

8472
09:03:24,410 --> 09:03:25,790
This area is quick?

8473
09:03:25,910 --> 09:03:27,790
Ok, then we'll go through it.

8474
09:03:32,510 --> 09:03:34,090
Get to the other side!

8475
09:03:34,270 --> 09:03:35,370
Staring at the wall.

8476
09:03:41,650 --> 09:03:43,330
I wanna play Uncharted.

8477
09:03:47,770 --> 09:03:49,590
Until you get to the last game?

8478
09:03:49,710 --> 09:03:50,030
Oh no!

8479
09:03:53,830 --> 09:03:56,430
This guy has...

8480
09:03:57,590 --> 09:03:59,030
World's thickest brain.

8481
09:03:59,350 --> 09:04:00,690
World's thickest skull.

8482
09:04:06,550 --> 09:04:07,990
Oh, the smoke.

8483
09:04:08,610 --> 09:04:09,130
Indy!

8484
09:04:10,030 --> 09:04:11,270
The smoke, Indy!

8485
09:04:19,630 --> 09:04:23,590
More straight combat than this, but the exploration platforming is similar.

8486
09:04:24,970 --> 09:04:26,290
As is the storytelling.

8487
09:04:27,110 --> 09:04:27,630
Oh, ok.

8488
09:04:28,210 --> 09:04:30,410
It's not like the combat that I'm super enjoying.

8489
09:04:30,510 --> 09:04:33,590
It's really, you know, I mean, it's fine, but...

8490
09:04:34,310 --> 09:04:40,910
You know, I'm just really enjoying the overarching story of this in general.

8491
09:04:41,150 --> 09:04:43,550
And also just, you know, it's really fun that we've...

8492
09:04:45,270 --> 09:04:47,490
That we've gone to so many locations now.

8493
09:04:48,130 --> 09:04:48,890
There she goes.

8494
09:04:51,150 --> 09:04:51,870
Oh, whoops.

8495
09:04:51,870 --> 09:04:54,610
And that's a 300k, Minky!

8496
09:04:55,290 --> 09:04:56,130
Thank you!

8497
09:04:56,830 --> 09:04:57,210
Oh my god.

8498
09:04:57,930 --> 09:04:59,470
We almost didn't make that, I feel.

8499
09:05:03,670 --> 09:05:05,850
It's a surprisingly worldly game.

8500
09:05:05,970 --> 09:05:06,170
Yeah!

8501
09:05:08,150 --> 09:05:09,510
Are you ok?

8502
09:05:11,910 --> 09:05:12,790
Oh, sorry.

8503
09:05:13,650 --> 09:05:14,410
It's probably fine.

8504
09:05:16,130 --> 09:05:17,090
It's working!

8505
09:05:31,300 --> 09:05:32,260
I was

8506
09:05:43,130 --> 09:05:46,110
getting ragdolled everywhere.

8507
09:05:49,150 --> 09:05:51,470
To be fair, planes are pretty much hollow back there.

8508
09:05:51,530 --> 09:05:52,330
Yeah, that's fair.

8509
09:05:52,930 --> 09:05:54,150
Yes, that's true.

8510
09:05:54,350 --> 09:05:56,230
I remember learning that from the boat.

8511
09:05:59,430 --> 09:06:00,390
They were much more lightweight.

8512
09:06:07,100 --> 09:06:07,580
No!

8513
09:06:07,960 --> 09:06:08,880
Are you kidding me right now?

8514
09:06:10,920 --> 09:06:12,540
Oh, I'm hitting them.

8515
09:06:13,640 --> 09:06:14,320
Don't worry!

8516
09:06:16,180 --> 09:06:17,420
Yeah, it was totally them.

8517
09:06:18,140 --> 09:06:19,100
It was totally them.

8518
09:06:19,360 --> 09:06:20,180
They got us.

8519
09:06:20,400 --> 09:06:20,880
Oh no!

8520
09:06:23,100 --> 09:06:24,200
They got us!

8521
09:06:25,400 --> 09:06:26,420
Oh my gosh.

8522
09:06:26,800 --> 09:06:27,380
Metal gear.

8523
09:06:28,560 --> 09:06:29,300
Oh gosh.

8524
09:06:29,860 --> 09:06:31,080
Driving with Eva scene.

8525
09:06:31,320 --> 09:06:31,880
Oh my gosh.

8526
09:06:32,920 --> 09:06:33,540
I'm trying!

8527
09:06:33,720 --> 09:06:33,900
I'm trying!

8528
09:06:35,580 --> 09:06:36,080
I'm

8529
09:06:44,460 --> 09:06:44,900
going in.

8530
09:06:45,080 --> 09:06:46,040
Oh god, our plane!

8531
09:06:46,040 --> 09:06:46,120
Please!

8532
09:06:46,900 --> 09:06:47,340
Please!

8533
09:06:49,340 --> 09:06:50,980
I can't see through the smoke!

8534
09:07:00,940 --> 09:07:02,260
Need more bullets!

8535
09:07:04,000 --> 09:07:06,940
It's ok, we don't need the tail.

8536
09:07:07,080 --> 09:07:08,940
I just blasted it off so I can see better.

8537
09:07:09,560 --> 09:07:10,000
Obviously.

8538
09:07:16,370 --> 09:07:17,510
Reload while we are in here.

8539
09:07:19,510 --> 09:07:20,390
Strategic reloading.

8540
09:07:21,110 --> 09:07:21,550
Lounging!

8541
09:07:26,590 --> 09:07:27,870
No way!

8542
09:07:32,630 --> 09:07:35,990
Guys, if we get hit one more time, we are done.

8543
09:07:37,630 --> 09:07:39,050
Is there anyone else?

8544
09:07:39,730 --> 09:07:40,250
Oh my god.

8545
09:07:40,730 --> 09:07:41,070
Where?

8546
09:07:41,590 --> 09:07:41,930
Where?

8547
09:07:42,250 --> 09:07:43,550
Oh my god, I can't...

8548
09:07:45,870 --> 09:07:46,930
Exit turret!

8549
09:07:53,320 --> 09:07:54,740
Oh, we are actually getting out?

8550
09:07:56,400 --> 09:07:57,260
Oh my god.

8551
09:08:08,000 --> 09:08:09,320
Ok, we start from here.

8552
09:08:09,480 --> 09:08:09,960
That's fine.

8553
09:08:20,210 --> 09:08:21,670
Maybe that's our new plane though.

8554
09:08:25,370 --> 09:08:26,590
I was so close!

8555
09:08:34,170 --> 09:08:34,570
Ready?

8556
09:08:34,850 --> 09:08:36,550
Oh, once it goes back up...

8557
09:08:42,330 --> 09:08:43,190
Oh my god.

8558
09:08:43,270 --> 09:08:43,730
Ok, ok.

8559
09:08:44,310 --> 09:08:45,570
Oh, I have to be fast!

8560
09:08:45,730 --> 09:08:46,390
Ok, ok, ok.

8561
09:08:46,390 --> 09:08:48,150
Oh my god, I have to be super fast.

8562
09:08:49,950 --> 09:08:51,090
Too slow!

8563
09:08:52,030 --> 09:08:53,310
Too slow, beetle!

8564
09:08:59,950 --> 09:09:00,930
Don't crash!

8565
09:09:02,670 --> 09:09:03,630
Don't crash!

8566
09:09:16,230 --> 09:09:16,870
Indeed.

8567
09:09:17,350 --> 09:09:17,930
No way.

8568
09:09:18,410 --> 09:09:20,050
This is so...

8569
09:09:20,050 --> 09:09:20,730
Oh my god!

8570
09:09:30,010 --> 09:09:30,530
Die!

8571
09:09:32,590 --> 09:09:33,110
My...

8572
09:09:33,110 --> 09:09:33,810
Die!

8573
09:09:35,110 --> 09:09:38,990
The only words I've been able to understand this whole game.

8574
09:09:48,170 --> 09:09:49,070
Oh my god.

8575
09:09:51,810 --> 09:09:53,210
What if I didn't grab her hand?

8576
09:09:53,270 --> 09:09:54,250
That would have been wild, huh?

8577
09:09:56,630 --> 09:09:57,150
Yay!

8578
09:09:57,290 --> 09:09:58,130
Into the fire!

8579
09:09:59,250 --> 09:10:00,310
Oh, I see your hat.

8580
09:10:00,370 --> 09:10:01,270
Where is it?

8581
09:10:03,610 --> 09:10:04,210
Deanna

8582
09:10:13,550 --> 09:10:14,930
Jones didn't know how to fly a plane.

8583
09:10:29,670 --> 09:10:31,010
Oh yeah, fly?

8584
09:10:31,170 --> 09:10:31,490
Yes.

8585
09:10:32,270 --> 09:10:32,690
Land?

8586
09:10:32,750 --> 09:10:33,050
No.

8587
09:10:43,490 --> 09:10:45,810
You look so...

8588
09:10:47,930 --> 09:10:50,810
I don't know how this rock would bring us halfway across the world.

8589
09:10:52,990 --> 09:10:55,190
The only thing I know is... My man is stunned.

8590
09:10:55,470 --> 09:10:57,390
No one can ever use those stones again.

8591
09:10:58,870 --> 09:10:59,270
Chill.

8592
09:10:59,690 --> 09:11:00,890
What's your theory, professor?

8593
09:11:02,730 --> 09:11:03,670
Think about it.

8594
09:11:04,970 --> 09:11:07,030
Nazis use them, they end up on the top of a mountain.

8595
09:11:07,170 --> 09:11:10,050
We use them and we end up dodging bullets and bombs in a war zone.

8596
09:11:11,510 --> 09:11:13,850
See what happens when mortals mess with this kind of power.

8597
09:11:16,070 --> 09:11:17,430
Doesn't end well.

8598
09:11:19,030 --> 09:11:22,990
Look, I can...

8599
09:11:22,990 --> 09:11:25,410
What is...Miss Gollum?

8600
09:11:25,630 --> 09:11:27,050
I can't with her.

8601
09:11:28,390 --> 09:11:29,350
I'm not going anywhere.

8602
09:11:29,510 --> 09:11:30,530
We found your sister.

8603
09:11:30,730 --> 09:11:31,990
Your job is done, Gina.

8604
09:11:34,490 --> 09:11:35,570
I'm precious.

8605
09:11:38,720 --> 09:11:40,560
That was so sus.

8606
09:11:40,860 --> 09:11:42,120
Where are the other stones?

8607
09:11:42,120 --> 09:11:48,040
Well, the nearest site on the great circle would be Sukhothai.

8608
09:11:48,720 --> 09:11:50,540
Deep inside the jungles of Siam.

8609
09:11:50,860 --> 09:11:52,020
Sukhothai-dees!

8610
09:11:52,340 --> 09:11:55,700
Not a chance.

8611
09:11:57,020 --> 09:12:00,680
None of the relics in the Vatican treasure chamber came from Sukhothai.

8612
09:12:01,620 --> 09:12:02,680
It's gotta be there.

8613
09:12:02,860 --> 09:12:03,780
She beat me to it.

8614
09:12:04,820 --> 09:12:05,980
What are we waiting for?

8615
09:12:06,000 --> 09:12:07,220
You are mean though.

8616
09:12:08,280 --> 09:12:11,220
I knew somebody would say it.

8617
09:12:19,340 --> 09:12:20,380
Excuse me?

8618
09:12:23,220 --> 09:12:24,620
Maybe he doesn't know how to fly it.

8619
09:12:28,840 --> 09:12:32,890
Oh my gosh.

8620
09:12:32,930 --> 09:12:35,870
It's like we are watching a never ending Indiana Jones movie.

8621
09:12:35,970 --> 09:12:36,750
It's so great.

8622
09:12:37,070 --> 09:12:38,150
It's my dream come true.

8623
09:12:40,770 --> 09:12:41,250
Truly.

8624
09:12:55,470 --> 09:12:56,790
Let's take the watch along.

8625
09:13:00,230 --> 09:13:02,450
He's back to being open shirted.

8626
09:13:08,390 --> 09:13:09,090
I'm glad.

8627
09:13:09,210 --> 09:13:10,630
I hope you guys have been enjoying it too.

8628
09:13:10,630 --> 09:13:13,870
Hopefully I don't make it too motion sick inducing.

8629
09:13:14,250 --> 09:13:15,730
With me looking all over the place like...

8630
09:13:16,750 --> 09:13:18,790
I hope you guys are enjoying it too though.

8631
09:13:21,150 --> 09:13:22,350
He needs a new shirt.

8632
09:13:22,470 --> 09:13:24,010
No, I paid for this DLC.

8633
09:13:24,690 --> 09:13:26,430
I paid for his ripped open shirt.

8634
09:13:35,090 --> 09:13:36,390
Some hats though.

8635
09:13:38,990 --> 09:13:39,770
What is that?

8636
09:13:40,010 --> 09:13:40,610
A jerky?

8637
09:13:42,390 --> 09:13:44,330
A friendly cat with a feeble meow.

8638
09:13:46,570 --> 09:13:48,270
Oh my god.

8639
09:13:48,350 --> 09:13:49,090
Little baby.

8640
09:13:49,230 --> 09:13:49,930
So fluffy.

8641
09:13:52,770 --> 09:13:54,530
I literally decided to play this game because of you.

8642
09:13:55,010 --> 09:13:55,490
Good.

8643
09:13:56,910 --> 09:13:57,950
So fun.

8644
09:13:58,370 --> 09:13:59,690
There's a lot of stuff that I'll miss too.

8645
09:13:59,810 --> 09:14:00,530
And I've already missed.

8646
09:14:01,770 --> 09:14:02,670
Enjoy it.

8647
09:14:06,750 --> 09:14:10,150
Is he going to say room?

8648
09:14:13,250 --> 09:14:13,850
Yeah.

8649
09:14:15,750 --> 09:14:17,670
Actually, just get us room.

8650
09:14:20,590 --> 09:14:21,950
Oh my god.

8651
09:14:22,050 --> 09:14:22,830
I miss my cat.

8652
09:14:30,170 --> 09:14:32,010
The cat is cute.

8653
09:14:35,090 --> 09:14:36,290
Okay guys.

8654
09:14:36,510 --> 09:14:37,530
Wait, is the cat still there?

8655
09:14:41,390 --> 09:14:41,990
Sad.

8656
09:14:42,790 --> 09:14:43,630
So sad.

8657
09:14:43,850 --> 09:14:47,950
Okay, I think I should actually call it here.

8658
09:14:48,030 --> 09:14:49,190
I need to finish my dinner.

8659
09:14:51,510 --> 09:14:52,950
I feel like...

8660
09:14:53,710 --> 09:14:56,910
I feel like even though this game is so long...

8661
09:14:56,910 --> 09:14:59,310
I feel like I could've like...

8662
09:14:59,310 --> 09:14:59,990
What's the word?

8663
09:15:00,810 --> 09:15:02,690
Played it all in one time.

8664
09:15:03,430 --> 09:15:04,350
Start to end.

8665
09:15:05,870 --> 09:15:09,370
I could keep going the whole way.

8666
09:15:12,300 --> 09:15:13,900
But this is so fun.

8667
09:15:13,900 --> 09:15:17,060
I feel like I could've marathoned the whole game.

8668
09:15:19,380 --> 09:15:20,680
It's one of those games.

8669
09:15:20,820 --> 09:15:22,360
Yeah, it is.

8670
09:15:24,280 --> 09:15:25,780
Having so much fun with it.

8671
09:15:26,200 --> 09:15:33,620
And it's like, you know, it's got brainy bits with like puzzles and sneaky bits with some guys.

8672
09:15:34,040 --> 09:15:36,160
And the action is not bad.

8673
09:15:36,240 --> 09:15:37,900
It's just like beat up some guys.

8674
09:15:37,980 --> 09:15:40,800
It's like just the right amount for me, I feel.

8675
09:15:40,800 --> 09:15:42,380
Thank you for the long stream.

8676
09:15:42,460 --> 09:15:44,980
Those last few sections were so intense.

8677
09:15:45,320 --> 09:15:46,120
Pet Paws for us.

8678
09:15:46,160 --> 09:15:48,960
Oh my gosh, Paws was so sweet this morning.

8679
09:15:49,380 --> 09:15:53,300
She's been getting like more and more like...

8680
09:15:53,300 --> 09:15:57,480
Sleeping in bed with me and just being a sweet...

8681
09:15:57,480 --> 09:15:59,040
All around sweety girl.

8682
09:15:59,660 --> 09:16:01,080
And this morning, she...

8683
09:16:01,560 --> 09:16:04,240
She doesn't... She only usually lays in bed with me at night.

8684
09:16:04,920 --> 09:16:06,800
But this morning, she...

8685
09:16:06,800 --> 09:16:10,860
After causing much mischief trying to climb up my blinds...

8686
09:16:12,600 --> 09:16:14,840
She decided to lay in bed with me.

8687
09:16:15,380 --> 09:16:18,380
And then she loves like laying on my leg.

8688
09:16:19,680 --> 09:16:23,900
And I got... I sat up and she laid like on my leg and stretched out.

8689
09:16:24,240 --> 09:16:25,540
And like let me pet her.

8690
09:16:25,740 --> 09:16:30,600
She's also kind of like ADHD where like if I pet her at all, she'll wanna lick.

8691
09:16:30,720 --> 09:16:33,120
And like if she's licking, she does not wanna be pet.

8692
09:16:33,500 --> 09:16:34,920
That's like her licking time.

8693
09:16:34,920 --> 09:16:37,400
She gets really upset if I pet her when she's licking.

8694
09:16:37,860 --> 09:16:40,020
So, she's just been so...

8695
09:16:40,020 --> 09:16:41,560
This morning, she let me...

8696
09:16:41,560 --> 09:16:45,580
She was like purring and stretched and happy in bed with me.

8697
09:16:45,680 --> 09:16:46,520
And I was so happy.

8698
09:16:47,160 --> 09:16:49,380
And Butaro's doing well too.

8699
09:16:49,560 --> 09:16:53,180
He's been recovering really well from his surgery.

8700
09:16:53,880 --> 09:16:57,920
And I feel like he's kind of returned back to normal like...

8701
09:16:58,580 --> 09:17:02,920
He's been going through like these weird episodes before the surgery where like...

8702
09:17:02,920 --> 09:17:05,100
He has like this...

8703
09:17:05,100 --> 09:17:05,740
How do I say?

8704
09:17:06,340 --> 09:17:08,500
Like he purrs, but it's not a good purr.

8705
09:17:08,640 --> 09:17:11,200
It's like trying to comfort himself.

8706
09:17:11,520 --> 09:17:12,820
Like it's like he's in pain.

8707
09:17:13,280 --> 09:17:15,400
And he's like very... He was very stressed.

8708
09:17:15,580 --> 09:17:17,160
And I felt really bad for him.

8709
09:17:17,920 --> 09:17:20,080
And he was like not relaxing at all.

8710
09:17:20,260 --> 09:17:23,760
And he was in the donut, so he was already so stressed.

8711
09:17:24,200 --> 09:17:24,640
And...

8712
09:17:24,640 --> 09:17:26,160
Thank you!

8713
09:17:27,360 --> 09:17:28,900
Thanks for hitting my heart!

8714
09:17:29,040 --> 09:17:29,780
Thank you, thank you!

8715
09:17:30,360 --> 09:17:31,300
Still on medicine or no?

8716
09:17:31,300 --> 09:17:32,500
Oh yeah, he's still on medicine.

8717
09:17:33,400 --> 09:17:33,880
But...

8718
09:17:34,880 --> 09:17:36,380
I've been giving him less and less.

8719
09:17:36,820 --> 09:17:38,980
Because he hasn't really been needing it.

8720
09:17:40,060 --> 09:17:43,340
But lately he's just been very calm and happy.

8721
09:17:43,840 --> 09:17:46,580
And I've been very thankful about that.

8722
09:17:46,680 --> 09:17:48,360
So I'm wondering if maybe he's...

8723
09:17:48,360 --> 09:17:49,960
His leg is starting to feel better.

8724
09:17:50,060 --> 09:17:51,500
I mean I'm sure the meds are helping too.

8725
09:17:52,280 --> 09:17:57,600
But maybe because he feels that there's no giant lump on his leg anymore.

8726
09:17:57,720 --> 09:17:59,100
That probably is really painful.

8727
09:17:59,100 --> 09:18:01,020
He's probably feeling...

8728
09:18:01,020 --> 09:18:04,260
Much more comfortable, I'd hope.

8729
09:18:05,300 --> 09:18:06,280
Thanks for the marathon, Minto!

8730
09:18:06,620 --> 09:18:07,880
A lot of cool moments in this game.

8731
09:18:08,060 --> 09:18:09,320
And nice callbacks to the films.

8732
09:18:09,860 --> 09:18:10,460
Also...

8733
09:18:10,460 --> 09:18:14,720
Liquid fist fight vibes on top of the plane earlier.

8734
09:18:15,480 --> 09:18:17,160
Except I won!

8735
09:18:20,820 --> 09:18:21,120
Yeah...

8736
09:18:22,480 --> 09:18:24,940
I think so, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8737
09:18:25,080 --> 09:18:26,600
Hot dog!

8738
09:18:28,700 --> 09:18:30,160
Thanks once again for the concert.

8739
09:18:30,360 --> 09:18:33,920
Suffice to say, seeing you and Doki and Dobi all on stage together was really special for me.

8740
09:18:34,660 --> 09:18:37,660
Really thanking my lucky stars I got the chance to see you perform twice!

8741
09:18:38,040 --> 09:18:39,240
What a crazy year it's been.

8742
09:18:39,640 --> 09:18:40,160
Thank you!

8743
09:18:42,500 --> 09:18:44,320
I started watching your...

8744
09:18:44,320 --> 09:18:48,060
Wait, I watched the start of your stream from one airport and I'm watching the end from another.

8745
09:18:49,000 --> 09:18:51,300
Hope you had a safe flight next, see?

8746
09:18:51,760 --> 09:18:52,940
Hope it was a good flight at least.

8747
09:18:53,480 --> 09:18:53,900
Minky.

8748
09:18:54,360 --> 09:18:54,880
Dash me.

8749
09:18:55,360 --> 09:18:55,780
Minky.

8750
09:18:57,080 --> 09:18:57,440
Minky.

8751
09:19:01,380 --> 09:19:03,160
So, is that it for the stream?

8752
09:19:03,360 --> 09:19:04,320
Yeah, I think so.

8753
09:19:04,440 --> 09:19:04,880
Yeah, yeah.

8754
09:19:05,020 --> 09:19:06,500
I think I'm gonna head out now.

8755
09:19:08,980 --> 09:19:09,340
So...

8756
09:19:09,340 --> 09:19:09,520
Oh!

8757
09:19:09,960 --> 09:19:10,180
P.S.

8758
09:19:10,220 --> 09:19:15,400
It was a pleasure getting to meet a bunch of wisps and goons and connect with a few faces to names in the chat.

8759
09:19:15,520 --> 09:19:21,060
For someone who was never into idol stuff before getting into Vtubers, it was so cool to experience some of the culture.

8760
09:19:21,220 --> 09:19:22,080
Can't wait for the next time.

8761
09:19:22,360 --> 09:19:22,660
Yeah!

8762
09:19:23,380 --> 09:19:24,120
It's so fun!

8763
09:19:24,280 --> 09:19:25,100
It's so fun!

8764
09:19:25,780 --> 09:19:28,080
You really, really, really...

8765
09:19:28,080 --> 09:19:33,000
You'll really get to understand it once you're there in the moment and get to see it with everyone.

8766
09:19:35,300 --> 09:19:36,800
Yeah, thanks for the stream.

8767
09:19:36,960 --> 09:19:37,760
Thank you!

8768
09:19:39,200 --> 09:19:40,220
Bye Mito, see you later.

8769
09:19:40,300 --> 09:19:40,780
Bye bye!

8770
09:19:41,940 --> 09:19:43,520
9 hour stream hot dog.

8771
09:19:43,960 --> 09:19:47,220
Yeah, I wanna do some longer streams before I go to Japan.

8772
09:19:47,420 --> 09:19:50,180
Like I said, I'm only in Japan for like a week and a half, so...

8773
09:19:50,180 --> 09:19:51,200
It's not super duper long.

8774
09:19:51,200 --> 09:19:59,360
I was planning on having some videos I upload while I'm gone, but I don't think I'm gonna have time to record them.

8775
09:20:00,860 --> 09:20:01,420
So...

8776
09:20:01,420 --> 09:20:03,820
Instead I'm planning on having like a...

8777
09:20:03,820 --> 09:20:08,020
Maybe like a Mito karaoke marathon that just plays 24 hours.

8778
09:20:08,700 --> 09:20:10,680
I don't think I have that much karaoke.

8779
09:20:12,380 --> 09:20:12,940
But...

8780
09:20:12,940 --> 09:20:14,240
Not the karaoke streams, I mean.

8781
09:20:16,160 --> 09:20:16,600
But...

8782
09:20:16,600 --> 09:20:17,400
Maybe just something...

8783
09:20:17,780 --> 09:20:20,300
So if you're just like, oh I need something to put on...

8784
09:20:20,300 --> 09:20:21,100
You can put it on.

8785
09:20:21,260 --> 09:20:22,200
I don't know, Mito radio.

8786
09:20:22,540 --> 09:20:23,080
Yeah, yeah.

8787
09:20:24,980 --> 09:20:25,420
So...

8788
09:20:25,420 --> 09:20:26,600
I can...

8789
09:20:26,600 --> 09:20:27,580
I can do that.

8790
09:20:27,700 --> 09:20:28,420
I'm getting a new...

8791
09:20:28,420 --> 09:20:30,740
I'm getting a new computer soon, basically.

8792
09:20:31,900 --> 09:20:32,340
So...

8793
09:20:32,340 --> 09:20:33,560
I can...

8794
09:20:33,560 --> 09:20:34,240
I can...

8795
09:20:35,160 --> 09:20:37,280
Let this one run into the dust.

8796
09:20:37,560 --> 09:20:38,500
No, I'm just kidding.

8797
09:20:39,540 --> 09:20:39,980
But...

8798
09:20:39,980 --> 09:20:40,340
Yeah.

8799
09:20:44,320 --> 09:20:45,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8800
09:20:49,510 --> 09:20:50,730
Set up Mito TV.

8801
09:20:52,530 --> 09:20:53,770
What do you mean, like before?

8802
09:20:56,390 --> 09:20:57,790
24 hour Mito karaoke.

8803
09:20:58,050 --> 09:20:59,610
Yeah, so if you're ever like, I need...

8804
09:20:59,610 --> 09:21:00,630
I want something to listen to.

8805
09:21:01,130 --> 09:21:02,070
You can check it...

8806
09:21:02,070 --> 09:21:02,610
You can watch.

8807
09:21:02,810 --> 09:21:03,590
And you don't have to watch.

8808
09:21:03,610 --> 09:21:04,730
It's just there in the background.

8809
09:21:04,930 --> 09:21:05,610
It's no biggie.

8810
09:21:07,090 --> 09:21:08,330
PC specs reveal.

8811
09:21:10,350 --> 09:21:11,150
I haven't...

8812
09:21:11,150 --> 09:21:11,650
Oh wait, no.

8813
09:21:12,030 --> 09:21:14,290
I've thought about just everything, actually.

8814
09:21:15,870 --> 09:21:17,670
Still waiting on things in the mail.

8815
09:21:19,210 --> 09:21:20,290
Where's my phone?

8816
09:21:23,790 --> 09:21:24,350
But...

8817
09:21:24,350 --> 09:21:26,970
I was gonna wait initially for...

8818
09:21:26,970 --> 09:21:29,730
I know everybody told me to wait for the new graphics card.

8819
09:21:30,590 --> 09:21:32,290
I know everybody told me to wait.

8820
09:21:33,570 --> 09:21:34,130
But...

8821
09:21:34,130 --> 09:21:34,910
I was like...

8822
09:21:34,910 --> 09:21:38,570
I got a pretty good deal on it.

8823
09:21:39,230 --> 09:21:40,430
Because of Black Friday.

8824
09:21:42,770 --> 09:21:43,330
And...

8825
09:21:44,470 --> 09:21:45,030
And...

8826
09:21:45,030 --> 09:21:46,210
I also...

8827
09:21:46,210 --> 09:21:48,230
Oh my gosh, I also got a new phone.

8828
09:21:48,610 --> 09:21:49,170
For streaming.

8829
09:21:49,890 --> 09:21:51,590
The phone I'm using...

8830
09:21:51,590 --> 09:21:52,330
Is like...

8831
09:21:53,950 --> 09:21:55,990
I got it from my friend.

8832
09:21:56,310 --> 09:21:56,670
They...

8833
09:21:56,670 --> 09:21:57,850
For a hundred dollars.

8834
09:21:58,010 --> 09:22:00,310
It's an iPhone that has like...

8835
09:22:00,310 --> 09:22:01,710
The most...

8836
09:22:01,710 --> 09:22:04,530
It was like the first iPhone to have the...

8837
09:22:04,530 --> 09:22:06,870
There's like a special thing you need on an iPhone.

8838
09:22:07,170 --> 09:22:07,970
For Vtubing.

8839
09:22:08,970 --> 09:22:11,150
And it's the first phone...

8840
09:22:11,150 --> 09:22:12,430
That has...

8841
09:22:13,230 --> 09:22:13,690
The...

8842
09:22:13,690 --> 09:22:15,250
The thing that you need.

8843
09:22:15,410 --> 09:22:16,690
So it's kind of outdated.

8844
09:22:18,050 --> 09:22:20,890
And I was talking to Cecilia and she was just like...

8845
09:22:20,890 --> 09:22:23,790
Oh yeah, you probably want to upgrade that when you can.

8846
09:22:25,370 --> 09:22:25,830
Because...

8847
09:22:25,830 --> 09:22:26,290
The...

8848
09:22:26,290 --> 09:22:30,130
The newer phone will give you better movement.

8849
09:22:30,530 --> 09:22:31,290
So I was like...

8850
09:22:31,290 --> 09:22:32,190
Really?

8851
09:22:34,610 --> 09:22:35,530
Yeah, so...

8852
09:22:36,510 --> 09:22:37,430
I have...

8853
09:22:37,430 --> 09:22:40,030
I didn't get like a brand new iPhone or anything like that.

8854
09:22:40,070 --> 09:22:40,890
Because I don't need that.

8855
09:22:40,950 --> 09:22:41,490
But I got...

8856
09:22:41,490 --> 09:22:42,090
Like a...

8857
09:22:42,090 --> 09:22:42,930
I got a new iPhone.

8858
09:22:43,510 --> 09:22:45,190
For not too much.

8859
09:22:46,150 --> 09:22:48,050
I tried to like really be like...

8860
09:22:48,050 --> 09:22:48,170
Okay.

8861
09:22:48,730 --> 09:22:50,110
Getting a good setup.

8862
09:22:52,250 --> 09:22:52,630
CC?

8863
09:22:53,010 --> 09:22:53,670
No, Cecilia.

8864
09:22:55,670 --> 09:22:56,430
Wait.

8865
09:22:57,470 --> 09:22:58,010
Celia!

8866
09:22:58,230 --> 09:22:58,510
Sorry.

8867
09:22:58,690 --> 09:22:59,250
Oh my gosh.

8868
09:22:59,350 --> 09:23:00,090
I'm so sorry.

8869
09:23:01,350 --> 09:23:02,870
My brain is mush.

8870
09:23:03,890 --> 09:23:04,470
Celia!

8871
09:23:04,850 --> 09:23:05,890
Not Cecilia.

8872
09:23:06,390 --> 09:23:07,030
Celia!

8873
09:23:09,130 --> 09:23:09,510
Sorry.

8874
09:23:09,510 --> 09:23:11,570
I have never talked to Cecilia.

8875
09:23:14,310 --> 09:23:15,550
I've never talked...

8876
09:23:15,550 --> 09:23:17,430
I'm sure she's a wonderful gal.

8877
09:23:17,850 --> 09:23:19,050
I've never talked to her before.

8878
09:23:20,310 --> 09:23:22,070
9 hours coming on strong.

8879
09:23:27,250 --> 09:23:28,430
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

8880
09:23:32,270 --> 09:23:33,670
But yeah, so...

8881
09:23:35,610 --> 09:23:36,250
Anyway.

8882
09:23:38,210 --> 09:23:39,510
Celia as in...

8883
09:23:39,510 --> 09:23:40,810
Yes, as in my papa.

8884
09:23:41,170 --> 09:23:41,890
Yes, Celia.

8885
09:23:42,730 --> 09:23:43,670
My rigger, yes.

8886
09:23:44,030 --> 09:23:45,730
The person that did my rigging.

8887
09:23:45,990 --> 09:23:47,470
The person that helps me move.

8888
09:23:48,010 --> 09:23:48,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

8889
09:23:49,970 --> 09:23:50,450
So...

8890
09:23:50,450 --> 09:23:52,210
I mix up similar names sometimes too.

8891
09:23:53,070 --> 09:23:54,250
I'm sorry, Celia!

8892
09:23:54,530 --> 09:23:56,330
If you're listening, you're probably not.

8893
09:23:56,510 --> 09:23:56,830
But it's okay.

8894
09:23:56,850 --> 09:23:57,190
I'm sorry.

8895
09:23:57,190 --> 09:23:57,290
Sorry.

8896
09:24:01,370 --> 09:24:01,850
Yeah.

8897
09:24:04,470 --> 09:24:07,070
But yeah, maybe I'll look a little bit better then.

8898
09:24:09,570 --> 09:24:10,370
Next year.

8899
09:24:11,050 --> 09:24:12,470
When everything comes in.

8900
09:24:13,330 --> 09:24:15,790
When everything comes in and I get everything set up.

8901
09:24:15,850 --> 09:24:19,770
I won't be able to set up my computer as soon as I get back.

8902
09:24:20,110 --> 09:24:22,330
It'll take me probably a minute to do that.

8903
09:24:22,450 --> 09:24:25,810
But I'll take a day and put it all together.

8904
09:24:25,810 --> 09:24:26,890
Or something.

8905
09:24:27,830 --> 09:24:29,910
Take it to someone to put it together for me.

8906
09:24:31,130 --> 09:24:32,090
I haven't decided.

8907
09:24:32,210 --> 09:24:33,190
Might be too jet lagged.

8908
09:24:33,330 --> 09:24:37,810
Actually, I have some stuff happening right when I get back.

8909
09:24:37,990 --> 09:24:39,110
But it's exciting stuff.

8910
09:24:39,170 --> 09:24:40,090
It's very cool stuff.

8911
09:24:41,670 --> 09:24:42,150
So...

8912
09:24:43,210 --> 09:24:46,290
Literally like two days or the day after I get back.

8913
09:24:47,430 --> 09:24:49,070
I have an exciting thing!

8914
09:24:49,270 --> 09:24:49,450
Yeah!

8915
09:24:49,450 --> 09:24:49,830
Yeah!

8916
09:24:51,630 --> 09:24:51,990
Yeah,

8917
09:24:55,490 --> 09:24:56,830
yeah, yeah.

8918
09:24:57,090 --> 09:24:57,750
Busy, busy.

8919
09:24:58,350 --> 09:24:58,570
Yep.

8920
09:24:59,190 --> 09:25:00,590
It's good though to be...

8921
09:25:00,590 --> 09:25:01,030
Busy.

8922
09:25:02,350 --> 09:25:03,510
It's good though to be busy.

8923
09:25:03,790 --> 09:25:04,010
Okay.

8924
09:25:04,610 --> 09:25:05,190
Alright guys.

8925
09:25:05,270 --> 09:25:05,790
Thank you all.

8926
09:25:05,910 --> 09:25:07,350
Sorry for a long, long stream.

8927
09:25:07,930 --> 09:25:09,490
If you're like, I can't watch all of this.

8928
09:25:09,590 --> 09:25:11,150
Well, I'll be gone for a week and a half.

8929
09:25:12,450 --> 09:25:12,810
So...

8930
09:25:12,810 --> 09:25:14,150
If you wanna catch up to anything.

8931
09:25:14,310 --> 09:25:15,990
That'll be your time to do so.

8932
09:25:18,470 --> 09:25:19,070
Otsu...

8933
09:25:19,070 --> 09:25:19,650
Mito!

8934
09:25:20,430 --> 09:25:21,190
Thank you guys!

8935
09:25:21,470 --> 09:25:22,330
Thank you, thank you!

8936
09:25:23,870 --> 09:25:24,470
And...

8937
09:25:24,470 --> 09:25:27,210
Oh gosh, it's already midnight.

8938
09:25:27,730 --> 09:25:29,490
When I see you next, I'll see you!

8939
09:25:30,130 --> 09:25:30,730
Otsu Mito!

8940
09:25:33,510 --> 09:25:35,510
Sorry, I accidentally pushed a button.

8941
09:25:37,750 --> 09:25:38,350
Otsu...

8942
09:25:38,350 --> 09:25:39,250
Otsu Mito!

8943
09:25:48,750 --> 09:25:50,570
I just got here.

8944
09:25:53,690 --> 09:25:54,430
I just got here.
