1
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,560
Hi guys, we are back with more in Missionary Zero.

2
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,560
We're here to save the moon!

3
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,180
The moon!

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,640
Yeah!

5
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,520
So like, if you guys can tell, we're all white except for mint.

6
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,920
I didn't get the memo.

7
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,940
At least this time we all have our spacesuits on.

8
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,660
We all... Okay, we're looking at everybody's screens.

9
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,060
Yeah, yeah, we all have our own little spaces this time.

10
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,020
Yeah, thank you for letting us rent them out.

11
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,280
No, thanks to the artists that I found.

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,560
Oh, I'm glad.

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,300
Yeah, mint's the main character now.

14
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,300
It's me!

15
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,760
The reason why we were a little late is because I actually made a public lobby.

16
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,060
Wraith, are you watching?

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
Are you watching this?

18
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,980
I'm sorry if we didn't give you a warm welcome.

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,320
We were like, get out!

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,800
Who are you?

21
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,720
Who are you?

22
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,180
Leave!

23
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,940
I feel bad if they aren't our viewer and then they joined and we were all just like, who is that?

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,620
I know.

25
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,620
We were all just yelling at him.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,420
We were all screaming at him.

27
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Did he hear you guys?

28
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,760
He never said hi.

29
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,200
Yeah.

30
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,080
Yeah, we don't all.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,860
Yeah, he never said hi to us too.

32
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,700
We were all like, I'll be too fair.

33
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,020
It was like, we're women screaming at him.

34
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,680
I know, just be like, what is this?

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,560
Who are you?

36
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,600
He's like, get out of here!

37
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,920
And I'm like, wait, I can kick him, guys.

38
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:53,680
But, um, it was actually really funny because like, when we were all getting together for the stream, um, Min and Nimi were like, I don't remember how I played a game.

39
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:53,940
No.

40
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,600
But then the thing is, on the other side, the yellow women, you being at, we were making a plan.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,720
We're making a plan!

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,580
We're making a plan!

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,500
We got the greens?

44
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,700
Yeah, we were making a plan.

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,980
We're gonna be carried today.

46
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,180
We wrote notes down.

47
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,300
Yeah, we wrote notes.

48
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,680
We're reliable people, right, dude?

49
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,640
Uh-huh.

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,320
Yeah, us yellow women, we know what to do.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,800
What?!

52
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,060
We worked out in our brains.

53
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,780
Yeah, we worked it out.

54
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,620
What is this?

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
What do you guys bring to the table, huh?

56
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,280
Yeah, what are you guys doing?

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,020
I bring the colors!

58
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,880
I bring the...

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
I do the cooking!

60
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,620
I do the cleaning!

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,280
Okay.

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,960
What about you, Mimi?

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,140
What's your job?

64
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,010
I'm quite... I'm just quite... I'm prepared.

65
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,150
I forgot my homework at home.

66
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,670
What were we doing?

67
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:52,510
I don't remember... Okay, so... So, remember this area where there was that man that kept killing us?

68
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,950
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

69
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,510
So, we're gonna skip that for now.

70
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,050
We're gonna do the easier task.

71
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,390
Okay.

72
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:57,490
So... Okay.

73
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,130
Um, the thing is...

74
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,630
Um, the... the trees with orange leaves, that one... Yeah.

75
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,190
Um, we dug up two of those.

76
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,370
But what happened to those items?

77
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,950
I don't know.

78
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:11,830
Oh, I don't know.

79
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,110
Oh, yeah.

80
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:12,950
We don't have any items.

81
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,010
I guess we gotta get them again.

82
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:14,850
No!

83
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,490
Because I already see one tree... yellow... orange tree in front of me.

84
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,290
But it says two out of five on the objectives.

85
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,170
Yeah, but we need to put the items in the yellow car.

86
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,850
Oh!

87
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,790
What if it's a bug?

88
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,770
What if we lost them?

89
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,030
Oh, I don't know.

90
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,810
Maybe... maybe it's in that... maybe it's in the... the... the vending machine or whatever.

91
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,590
Oh, it could be!

92
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

93
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:34,370
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

94
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,730
Let's go to the vending machine, please.

95
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,590
How do we... Okay, hold on.

96
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,410
I need to... What's the controls again for this game?

97
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,150
Wow!

98
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,370
Wow!

99
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:41,950
Wow!

100
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,010
I think there's a vending machine over here.

101
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,050
Oh!

102
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,070
Alright.

103
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,170
Let me know if the audio's okay, guys.

104
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,270
This game... it's so hard.

105
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,170
Oh!

106
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,190
Oh, they're right here!

107
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:55,510
Yeah!

108
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,010
Okay.

109
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,690
So, the thing about it is that...

110
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,930
It's just one yellow car.

111
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,390
I don't remember where the... I don't know where the yellow car is, but I know where all the trees are.

112
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,930
Well, I don't know where all the trees are, but... I know where some of the trees are.

113
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,590
We gotta explore for the trees.

114
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,650
Yeah.

115
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:10,650
Okay.

116
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:11,910
So...

117
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,290
So, someone has to carry the other two items.

118
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:15,550
Okay, everyone.

119
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,610
I got one.

120
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,450
Alright, let's go.

121
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:17,910
I'll watch.

122
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,110
Who is breathing?

123
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:20,590
Yeah.

124
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,990
Okay, so... Who is breathing?

125
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,050
We got this tree.

126
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:23,910
I think it's those cats.

127
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,310
Yeah, I think it's the cats.

128
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,690
Oh, there's also a tree over here on this side for sure.

129
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,330
We didn't dig that one, right?

130
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,110
I'm not sure, but there's like...

131
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,770
Watch out.

132
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,830
Don't die like Doki did last time.

133
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,990
Alright.

134
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,350
Dig.

135
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,770
I'll carry this one.

136
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,130
Dig!

137
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:45,610
Alright.

138
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:46,230
Yay!

139
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,710
Okay, so we need to find the yellow car for this.

140
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,630
Oh, I found another one!

141
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,730
Oh my god, the cat's here.

142
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,990
Oh, wait, that thing's dead.

143
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:53,630
That's a cat?

144
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:58,890
Why are we suddenly calling it a cat?

145
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,450
Oh my god.

146
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,210
Wait, how do you... Oh, crouch is this.

147
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,810
Wait, where is everybody?

148
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,370
Hello?

149
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,970
Wait, how'd they die?

150
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,250
Did they die?

151
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:15,990
Hello?

152
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,180
Oh shoot, are they dead?

153
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,360
No way.

154
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,800
Did everybody die?

155
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:27,900
No, no, no.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,040
It wouldn't be... Oh, there they are.

157
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,460
I was gonna say, it wouldn't be jumping all around like that then.

158
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,540
If they were dead.

159
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,750
I hear them.

160
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:41,770
Is this a yellow car?

161
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,050
No.

162
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,470
Failed to save the game.

163
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:43,750
Oh!

164
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,530
I'm here!

165
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:46,970
Oh.

166
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,230
Uh-oh.

167
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:50,030
Oh shoot.

168
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,110
Uh-oh.

169
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:53,730
Oh shoot.

170
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,570
Oh shoot.

171
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,950
Wait, I think they're possessed.

172
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:56,570
Ah!

173
00:06:59,210 --> 00:06:59,610
Wait!

174
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,790
We just started the game.

175
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,290
I'm too...

176
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,490
Ah!

177
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,770
Wait, wait, wait!

178
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,270
We just started the game, please!

179
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:05,930
Please!

180
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,070
Why?

181
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,250
We just started the game!

182
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,270
I'll go a circle.

183
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:13,890
I'm looping him.

184
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,490
I'm looping him.

185
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,150
I'm looping him.

186
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,730
I'm looping him.

187
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,010
I'm looping him.

188
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,350
I'm looping him.

189
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:19,770
Here.

190
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,250
Okay.

191
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,710
You're our hero!

192
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,990
See, that's why you're the main character!

193
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,210
I'm the main character!

194
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,630
I thought you were... We all thought you were dead!

195
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,830
No, I was just by myself!

196
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:41,790
I was scared!

197
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,470
I was literally trying... We were literally trying to revive you!

198
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,410
Let me over here!

199
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,330
We gotta find the yellow car... There's a thing all the way over there, be careful!

200
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:57,870
Okay... Oh wait... Oh, what the hell is that?

201
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,390
What is that?

202
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,730
Oh wait, the yellow car is over here!

203
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,730
It's on the other side of the hill!

204
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:02,910
Oh!

205
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,670
Okay, okay... Wait, what's he saying?

206
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,150
Oh, he wants the orange!

207
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:07,870
Wait, should we help him?

208
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:08,970
Yeah, we should!

209
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,370
We should!

210
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:09,870
Yeah!

211
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:14,090
Never mind... Wait, yellow woman can't see yellow?

212
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,170
We died!

213
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,250
It looked yellowish!

214
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,230
This guy wants the orange, finally!

215
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,470
Yeah, we should help him!

216
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,790
Take the orange!

217
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,370
I don't remember where it was!

218
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,250
I don't remember, too!

219
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:28,930
Yeah, probably!

220
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,370
I wanted to find this... Goddamn yellow car!

221
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,390
It has to be, like, outside here!

222
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:36,310
Maybe it's inside in the... In here?

223
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,610
In the middle?

224
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,510
Oh, there's an orb over there!

225
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:39,730
Oh!

226
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:40,830
Oh, yeah!

227
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,330
It's right where we lived!

228
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,070
There was a guy over here!

229
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:44,950
So we should be careful!

230
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:45,390
Yeah!

231
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,710
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

232
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,530
No, I remember!

233
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,090
I... I definitely remember!

234
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,650
Maybe it's on this side!

235
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,910
I'm gonna check this side!

236
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,790
Like, cause we didn't go to... We didn't explore this area too much!

237
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:03,690
Did we explore this... Did we explore all of this side?

238
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,030
I don't think so!

239
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,090
I think you guys got... This is, like, the part that loops around, isn't it?

240
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,050
There's probably down here, right?

241
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,110
Yeah, this was the car with... There's so many cars!

242
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,770
Surely one of them is yellow!

243
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:15,570
Yellow car!

244
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:17,150
Yeah, this is a dead end!

245
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,470
No, it's a dead end!

246
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,690
Oh, no!

247
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:21,690
Please!

248
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,170
What did we do all the way back to the beginning?

249
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,610
There's no way!

250
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,650
There's no way!

251
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:25,930
No!

252
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,530
I thought you took notes!

253
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,370
Wait, is our car yellow?

254
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:30,170
I took notes!

255
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:30,650
Uh-oh!

256
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,490
There's the guy!

257
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,210
There's the jumpy guy!

258
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,590
Okay!

259
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,450
Oh, there's the jumpy!

260
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,570
Yay!

261
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,610
I'm gonna go for it!

262
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,670
Yeah!

263
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:35,790
Yeah!

264
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:35,850
Yeah!

265
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,910
Yeah!

266
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,010
Holy cow!

267
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,530
Oh my god.

268
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,870
Okay, here we go.

269
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,890
We went left, right?

270
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:49,950
Okay, let's go right.

271
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,070
There has to be one yellow car.

272
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,450
Maybe it's with all these guys in here.

273
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,450
Yeah, it could be over here.

274
00:09:58,810 --> 00:09:59,670
Oh, that's true.

275
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,510
Aren't we missing someone?

276
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,850
I don't know, there's no cars over here.

277
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,610
Oh my god.

278
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,270
Are we?

279
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,910
Mimi?

280
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:07,490
Mimi?

281
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,990
Wait, where's your other green one?

282
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,270
Green woman.

283
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,990
Green lost.

284
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,110
Green woman lost.

285
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,730
Hold on.

286
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,370
Green woman lost.

287
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,870
I thought I just saw her over here.

288
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,470
Maybe she split up.

289
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,110
Split up, gang.

290
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:21,590
All right.

291
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,710
Wait, where's Doobie?

292
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,190
Where's the other yellow woman?

293
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:25,810
Oh my god, that's scary.

294
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:26,830
Oh, okay.

295
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:27,630
There, let's see.

296
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,070
Hello.

297
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,310
Oh, hello.

298
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,130
Oh, hello.

299
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,370
I dropped the battery somewhere.

300
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,410
Oh.

301
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,410
Oh, no.

302
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,390
It's okay.

303
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,890
We'll find her.

304
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,430
Oh, I see her.

305
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:39,990
Okay, okay.

306
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,150
Is it over here?

307
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,250
Dookie's got it, yeah.

308
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,410
I got it, I got it.

309
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:46,490
Oh, thank you, thank you.

310
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,810
So we gotta go...

311
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,770
We gotta go... Uh... Wait, where's my shovel?

312
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,050
Is it... You can have multiple items in your inventory, right?

313
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,310
Wait.

314
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,570
What happened to my shovel?

315
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,370
It's back there.

316
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:58,750
Oh!

317
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,850
Can you not?

318
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:00,550
Oh, don't.

319
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,690
Okay, I got my... Wait.

320
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,510
Wait, I can't... Oh, no.

321
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,450
I can't carry the shovel because it's too heavy.

322
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,210
Oh.

323
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,410
Yeah, yeah.

324
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,250
Wait, where did Doobie go?

325
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:15,670
Doobie?

326
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,130
Doobie?

327
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,930
Should we... Should we... Save?

328
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,190
She should be fine, right?

329
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,170
Right?

330
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,070
I'm sure she's just looking for the yellow car, right?

331
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,170
Yeah.

332
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:26,610
Right.

333
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,790
The goddamn delusive yellow car.

334
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,470
I don't think it's out here.

335
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,990
I think it might be somewhere else.

336
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,350
I mean, right here is the other guy.

337
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:35,910
Yeah.

338
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:37,670
Oh my god, okay.

339
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:39,170
I can't be there.

340
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,490
I thought it was, like, closer.

341
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,050
We haven't found it.

342
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,730
Doobie did something.

343
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,630
What?

344
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,390
What did Doobie do?

345
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,030
Wait, how do you know Doobie did something?

346
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,770
Is our task updated?

347
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:50,330
Oh!

348
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,230
Doobie doobie do.

349
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:52,410
Yeah.

350
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,530
Doobie do.

351
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,530
Where are you?

352
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,810
What did Doobie doobie.

353
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:58,090
Oh!

354
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,990
Wait, is that yellow car?

355
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,990
Do you see a car up there?

356
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,030
There's a yellow car?

357
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,590
Oh, I see it all the way in the back.

358
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:02,950
Is that yellow?

359
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:03,750
Are you kidding me?

360
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,750
It looks yellow, yeah.

361
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,430
Is that yellow?

362
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,710
He's coming towards us.

363
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,710
He's coming towards us.

364
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,970
He is, he is.

365
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:11,930
Okay.

366
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:12,770
All right.

367
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,840
Ah, he's following you.

368
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,060
He's following you.

369
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,640
Wait.

370
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,860
He's following you, Nimi.

371
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,030
Yellow woman down?

372
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,010
Uh-oh.

373
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,930
Do you think she's got it?

374
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,510
Oh gosh, I'm just gonna run for it.

375
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,350
But it's so loud, it's scary.

376
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,770
Someone was down!

377
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,050
It's the yellow car.

378
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,810
Margaret's edge over there...

379
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,330
wait, it said,

380
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,200
oh here...

381
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,820
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, please no!

382
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,780
please God...

383
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,740
Okay, we're finally started.

384
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,920
I think we lost Nimi.

385
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,340
Hello.

386
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,380
Welcome back.

387
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,060
You're a doobie.

388
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,640
You're a doobie.

389
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,660
I couldn't tell because you were all white.

390
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,080
I dropped the battery near the yellow car, though.

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,800
Oh, okay.

392
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,400
It's on the back of the car.

393
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
You have to, like, yeah.

394
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,920
I put mine in.

395
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,720
I'll take doobie to it.

396
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,760
I found a map of all the batteries and where the car is.

397
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,800
It's over there, though.

398
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,600
We can go afterwards.

399
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,120
Oh, nice.

400
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,080
Yeah, yeah, nice, nice.

401
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,300
So, we just need to find... We just have, like, two more batteries.

402
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,720
And then... Because that unlocks one of the electrical boards.

403
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,600
Oh.

404
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

405
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,320
This area is so scary.

406
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,260
I told you I took it.

407
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,440
Run through the building.

408
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,620
Run through the building.

409
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,160
Or... Yeah.

410
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,300
I'm gonna freaking die.

411
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,120
I'm gonna freaking die.

412
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,280
Don't freaking die.

413
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,640
Don't do it.

414
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,680
It's on the back.

415
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,580
Right click, right click.

416
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,180
Okay, okay.

417
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:31,640
Yeah.

418
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,000
Where did I drop it?

419
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,540
I got it.

420
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,500
Okay, keep going straight.

421
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,800
And there's a map over here.

422
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,260
This way.

423
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,120
If we go this way.

424
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,480
Where's the other battery?

425
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,280
Oh, there it is.

426
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,720
Okay, okay.

427
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,340
Wait, where am I now?

428
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,540
I don't know.

429
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,240
They say certain items are buried in... Oh, yeah.

430
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,660
The trees.

431
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,340
I was following doobie and then I lost her.

432
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,660
Yeah?

433
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,220
Hello.

434
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:58,820
Hello.

435
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,270
Oh, they're all over there.

436
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:16,330
Oh, they're all over there.

437
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,270
I was a scaredy cat and I ran back inside.

438
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,290
Okay, I'll run too.

439
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,850
We're running in solidarity as a team.

440
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,130
We're running as a team.

441
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,930
Oh, we're trying to... There's one more here.

442
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,330
Oh my god, these are so scary.

443
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,210
Oh my gosh, these are so scary.

444
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,470
I'm here!

445
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,030
Oh, keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going.

446
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,230
Okay, time!

447
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,670
Oh, save, save, save, save, save.

448
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,090
What is that?

449
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:47,550
Okay.

450
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,230
I'm so jumpy today.

451
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:50,890
Holy cow.

452
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,370
There's a map here.

453
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,230
I don't know which one we got.

454
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,470
Yeah, it's kind of hard to tell.

455
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,270
I think we just need the one right here that you passed, no?

456
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,550
No, no.

457
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,330
We need one more.

458
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,630
So two more.

459
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,210
I think...

460
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,970
Two, four... No, yeah.

461
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:15,070
So it has to be on the other side.

462
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,450
Where all the other trees were.

463
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:18,850
Wait, did we save?

464
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,330
Yeah, we did.

465
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:20,670
Yeah.

466
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:21,430
Yeah.

467
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,890
Wait, what happened to the... Did you guys pick up the other battery?

468
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:25,250
No.

469
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,870
Which... Which other battery?

470
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,350
The one that just dug up.

471
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,130
It's like over there.

472
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,370
Oh, yeah.

473
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,170
That's what I was saying.

474
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:32,030
I think... Is that not the last one that we need?

475
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:32,810
No, no.

476
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,770
It's three out of five.

477
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,630
Oh, oh.

478
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:36,250
You're right.

479
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,670
It totally says that right there.

480
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,610
You know, it's just numbers.

481
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,010
I can't count.

482
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:41,230
I can't count.

483
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,890
Does your strategy guide include the code for that safe in there?

484
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:48,670
I don't have any chance.

485
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,270
I don't.

486
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,490
You went to the yellow car.

487
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,190
Oh, I'm trapped.

488
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,690
I'm gonna see if I can find that.

489
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,670
Wait, I see a tree over... No, maybe it's just a street light.

490
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:58,690
Maybe.

491
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,490
I'll go over.

492
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,350
I'll check it.

493
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,250
Doesn't hurt.

494
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:06,490
Wait, how do we get out?

495
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:06,830
Oh, yeah.

496
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,490
There's a door.

497
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,590
Wow, thanks.

498
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,410
Thanks, Doki Bird.

499
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,390
Your wisdom is... Is infinite.

500
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:15,970
What?

501
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,430
I'm almost positive we've gotten this.

502
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:19,810
Yeah.

503
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,710
Yeah, we... Yeah, but some of the... It says, like, some of them... Do we get out?

504
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,890
Yeah, wait.

505
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,610
I'll give you guys the battery and I'll go back to the map and check it again.

506
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:28,030
Okay.

507
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:28,210
Okay.

508
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:28,530
Okay.

509
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,470
There might be one over here.

510
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,330
Watch out for the hand.

511
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:33,890
It's okay.

512
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:34,790
You can't reach me.

513
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:35,210
Yeah.

514
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:35,690
Oh.

515
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:36,730
Oh, you're right.

516
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:37,370
He's stuck.

517
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:37,970
Trapped.

518
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,010
Doesn't hurt.

519
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,130
Okay.

520
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:40,310
This is a dead end.

521
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,870
I thought I could get to the other side.

522
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,290
Oh.

523
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,930
Wait, I can.

524
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:44,530
Oh.

525
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,130
What is that?

526
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:46,450
Yeah.

527
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,170
Shortcut?

528
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,410
What is that?

529
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,750
What's it shaking for?

530
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,050
What's shaking?

531
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,790
Bacon?

532
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:55,930
Freeze.

533
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:56,570
Freeze.

534
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,730
Oh, this is where we're at.

535
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,890
Where everybody died at the library.

536
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:00,530
Oh.

537
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,950
The underground.

538
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:02,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

540
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,590
I remember.

541
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,270
Oh, it says, like, a shortcut.

542
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,250
Oh, yeah.

543
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,710
You have to go back to the yellow car.

544
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,630
Do you think you can do it?

545
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:11,690
Wait, wait.

546
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,810
There's a guy right inside.

547
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:13,110
No?

548
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,350
I just saw him walk.

549
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,670
Oh, it's the... It's the orange things.

550
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,450
The orange glows.

551
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,430
Oh, yeah.

552
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,710
Who's back here?

553
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,930
Orange glows?

554
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,450
Uh, coven.

555
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,650
Oh, the coven guys.

556
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:30,610
Yeah.

557
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,310
Oh, yeah.

558
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:32,690
Oh,

559
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,490
maybe we... Oh, yeah.

560
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:37,490
See, there's the library.

561
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:37,910
Okay.

562
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,030
I was like...

563
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,130
I think I know where we are.

564
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,210
This is for me?

565
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,710
That's really kind of you.

566
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,750
With your help, I think we might finally manage the head replacement.

567
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,130
I've heard there's a people past in the basement that leads straight into the laboratory.

568
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:50,750
I think we're okay.

569
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,750
See you in the basement, and check your map.

570
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,950
There's a hidden way into the basement outside of the main building.

571
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:57,250
Oh?

572
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,550
Oh, what?

573
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:58,710
Oh.

574
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,010
Oh, there's God.

575
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,490
I didn't really process what he meant by that.

576
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,270
There's a secret way to that basement.

577
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,750
Outside the main building.

578
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:08,630
Outside the main building.

579
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,490
Outside the main building.

580
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,570
Yeah, where are we going?

581
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,730
Um... We're literally missing one tree.

582
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,710
One tree.

583
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,850
You got this one?

584
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,510
We must have found this one.

585
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,270
Watch out, the eyeball.

586
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,070
It was dug.

587
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,130
Yeah, see, like, this is dug up.

588
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,110
We got this one.

589
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,610
Was there another one?

590
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,550
There was another one on the other side, we got that one.

591
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,490
Yeah, that's three.

592
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:43,290
So we're... Do you think... Here, hold on, let's save right here just in case... Well, Doobie should be alive, right?

593
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,270
Right?

594
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:45,410
Okay, yeah, yeah.

595
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,230
Doobie's alive.

596
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:46,930
Doobie's alive.

597
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,310
So maybe to the right?

598
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,070
Watch out, watch out!

599
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,170
Watch out!

600
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,370
He's coming!

601
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,130
Oh, no!

602
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,970
Three, four, five.

603
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,270
That's the fifth tree!

604
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,690
That's the fifth tree!

605
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,110
We had to have gotten this though.

606
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,010
Apparently we got this one.

607
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,330
Yeah.

608
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:07,470
But I counted five.

609
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:09,650
What?

610
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,330
What happened to the last battery?

611
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:11,850
What happened to the last battery?

612
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:13,310
Do you think it's missing somewhere?

613
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,830
Maybe we dropped it when somebody died and we don't realize?

614
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,510
Oh, no.

615
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,210
Oh, no.

616
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,390
Did we respawn it somewhere?

617
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,470
Did we respawn it somewhere?

618
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,790
That's not a good thing.

619
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,870
Was it inside this building when we spawned?

620
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,370
Oh, no.

621
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,990
Oh, gosh.

622
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,010
There's a guy right there.

623
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:39,710
Oh, nice.

624
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:40,530
Oh, nice.

625
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:44,210
The thing is, Doobie, we found all the trees, but...

626
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,670
Those trees have been dug up.

627
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,350
Could we have counted one tree twice?

628
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,310
Did we count one tree twice?

629
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:52,330
Maybe.

630
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:52,350
Okay.

631
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,450
Far right.

632
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,230
One.

633
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,150
Two.

634
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,290
Two.

635
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,090
I think it's, like, all the way to the right.

636
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,570
Like, all the way.

637
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:00,870
Okay.

638
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,970
All the way down this way.

639
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,150
Wait, actually, wait.

640
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,230
Green women.

641
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:06,910
Yeah.

642
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,870
Put the battery in.

643
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,170
Oh, okay.

644
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:09,910
One of the guys should learn.

645
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:10,570
All right.

646
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,350
One of the women will find the last tree.

647
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,610
All right, Nimmy, let's go.

648
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,670
Wait, we're here, right?

649
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,010
Okay.

650
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,850
Yeah, yeah, it's over here.

651
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,570
It's easier, I think, to go inside the building, so...

652
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:20,830
Okay.

653
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:21,490
We'll just run.

654
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:25,470
I believe in the power of green.

655
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:26,290
Run in here!

656
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:27,950
Ah!

657
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,450
Keep going!

658
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:31,790
Keep going!

659
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,530
Keep going!

660
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,710
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run!

661
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,590
Okay!

662
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,450
Go, go, go!

663
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:41,630
Ah!

664
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,350
I'm looking for any batteries, just in case.

665
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,950
Oh, my God.

666
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,460
I'm gonna bring him to that...

667
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,800
No!

668
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,920
We did it!

669
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,880
We did it!

670
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,720
The green women did it!

671
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,180
We did it!

672
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,360
We did it!

673
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,620
We're still trying to find the orange tree.

674
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,760
We're still trying to find...

675
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,000
You counted how many?

676
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:22,820
I don't know.

677
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:23,880
You don't?

678
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,640
What do you mean you don't?

679
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,600
You have one job!

680
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,720
What do you mean you don't know?

681
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,420
Ooh, an egg!

682
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,340
Ooh!

683
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,420
Ooh, egg!

684
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,280
We dug that tree over there.

685
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Green.

686
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,460
Yeah, we did do this one!

687
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,120
Yeah, we did do this one!

688
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,100
Yeah.

689
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:41,580
Yeah.

690
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,280
Hmm.

691
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,800
I didn't see any while we were on that side, either.

692
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,800
I feel like my eyes were just glued to the jumping point.

693
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:52,720
I don't!

694
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,080
Uh-oh.

695
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,700
I think they're getting chased.

696
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,320
Oh, my God.

697
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,740
Who's...

698
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:05,840
Who's...

699
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,300
Who's...

700
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,480
Did the thing just jump in here?

701
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,500
Oh...

702
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,400
He's right behind me, isn't he, guys?

703
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:12,940
Oh.

704
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,620
Oh, my God!

705
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,880
His head extends!

706
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,060
Oh, my God!

707
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:20,580
His head...

708
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,360
Oh, I don't like that.

709
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,000
He can't come in here.

710
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,000
No, I don't think so.

711
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,040
Wait.

712
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,640
Okay, so...

713
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,900
We got...

714
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,280
Oh.

715
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:31,540
Hi.

716
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,000
Hi.

717
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,560
Hello.

718
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:33,920
Hello.

719
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,280
Yeah, what does the bloom mean?

720
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,780
That's where we are.

721
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,820
That's where we are.

722
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,180
We got the one...

723
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,720
That's where we are.

724
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:47,820
We got the one...

725
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,300
We got the tree to the left side.

726
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,040
So we need to get...

727
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,480
These three.

728
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,580
This is a confusing map.

729
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,060
What?

730
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,380
It makes no sense.

731
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,320
Huh?

732
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,220
Doobie even took a photo of it.

733
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,360
The real...

734
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,320
This is the real horror.

735
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,220
Reading a map.

736
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,920
Reading a map.

737
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,100
Who is that out there?

738
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,140
Silent Hill 2.

739
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,340
That's Doobie.

740
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,040
Oh, Doobie.

741
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,160
Doobie?

742
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,560
Blair witching out here.

743
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,300
Yes.

744
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,160
I'm gonna say.

745
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,480
Hello, I'm fixing something.

746
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,040
Oh, sure.

747
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,220
I'm fixing something on us.

748
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,280
You're good, you're good.

749
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,320
Okay, don't worry.

750
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,760
We'll protect you, Doobie.

751
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,960
Hi.

752
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:34,360
What's up?

753
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,860
Did you guys find it?

754
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,380
No.

755
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:37,740
No.

756
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,500
We got this.

757
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,380
Look, it's on the other side.

758
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,180
That's the thing.

759
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,840
I think we had it.

760
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,500
Maybe somebody dropped it.

761
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:49,500
This...

762
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,100
Uh oh.

763
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,580
Okay.

764
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,420
I don't wanna deal with it.

765
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,120
What if we dropped it in that...

766
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,140
This thing scares me!

767
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,640
What if we dropped it in that one building with the guy with the sword?

768
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Oh my gosh.

769
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,680
Wait, you might have a point there.

770
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,340
We'll find it.

771
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,200
I think...

772
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:09,760
Maybe it's safe?

773
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,580
No.

774
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:11,880
Is it safe?

775
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,000
Kind of.

776
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:14,740
Okay.

777
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,160
Where'd they go anyways?

778
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,120
The...

779
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,080
Where'd they go?

780
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,820
I don't know actually.

781
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,060
We could go check the sword building.

782
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,620
Oh, you wanna stay here?

783
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,980
No, no, no.

784
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,200
I got stuck on the...

785
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,460
Oh.

786
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,300
On the map.

787
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
That happened to me earlier.

788
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:33,920
Oh.

789
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Oh, there they are.

790
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,420
I see someone.

791
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,320
Yeah, let's check in the building.

792
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:38,680
Let's see.

793
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,420
I think so, yeah.

794
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,060
Oh, wait.

795
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:47,940
Wait.

796
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,480
Someone said that...

797
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,400
We only have dug four out of five.

798
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,140
It says it on our task list.

799
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:53,740
Yeah, okay.

800
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,420
And then...

801
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,700
Four is over here.

802
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,320
Oh yeah, yeah.

803
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,620
This one's dug up too.

804
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:00,740
Four.

805
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,300
Then there's one by the truck.

806
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,360
We did not dig here!

807
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:04,540
Oh.

808
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:04,960
Oh.

809
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,680
Oh.

810
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,000
We did though!

811
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,820
I think it reset because we definitely did before.

812
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,480
Mint picked this up.

813
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,320
Why me?

814
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,100
It's your fault.

815
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,340
It's your fault.

816
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,280
It's me!

817
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:24,100
It's my fault?

818
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,400
Okay.

819
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,480
That's fine.

820
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,240
I'm just kidding.

821
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,680
It's always the main character's fault.

822
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,000
It's the main character.

823
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,060
Okay, I'm the main character.

824
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,800
I'll put this in.

825
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:32,820
Do

826
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,240
we have to like start the car or something?

827
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,360
Or is it just gonna unlock?

828
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:39,640
Oh no.

829
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,000
It opens the electrical board.

830
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,740
I'm gonna watch.

831
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,580
Oh my god.

832
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,240
There's so...

833
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,460
I did it!

834
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,260
Oh it opened!

835
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,140
Oh my god.

836
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,780
I'm gonna die?

837
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,220
Oh god.

838
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,180
Oh god.

839
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,040
Oh god!

840
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,680
Is this...

841
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:02,820
Okay.

842
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,240
I don't know actually where they can go in and where they can't.

843
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,460
Okay!

844
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,740
I'm alive!

845
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,240
Somehow!

846
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,640
I don't like the way they breathe.

847
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,160
I don't know what was inside though.

848
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:17,940
I didn't get it.

849
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,580
Red electrical box.

850
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,000
The red electrical box.

851
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,500
I just hear them breathing.

852
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,000
I'm the main character!

853
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:40,040
I'm so sorry guys that the monsters are so loud.

854
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,960
It's because Nimi is kind of quiet.

855
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,540
And so I have it kind of way turned up.

856
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,120
So...

857
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,180
If you can't...

858
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,200
You can't adjust people individually.

859
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,300
So...

860
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,220
If we get spooked, we get spooked together!

861
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,920
It's scarier.

862
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,740
Yeah.

863
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,040
Hearing Nimi is important.

864
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:05,880
I agree.

865
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,740
I would rather hear Nimi than...

866
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,680
Anything else.

867
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,120
More immersive!

868
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,080
Okay.

869
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,420
I'm gonna run over there to them.

870
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,860
I just wanna explain that real quick for you guys.

871
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,720
Okay, run.

872
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:23,660
Oh wait.

873
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,600
I think I see this.

874
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,680
One of them.

875
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,600
What happens to the other?

876
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,710
What was in the trunk?

877
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,370
Did you get it?

878
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,150
No.

879
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,410
That was your job.

880
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:33,850
Oh no.

881
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:35,190
There was a guy right there.

882
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,490
My job was to put in the thing.

883
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:38,690
Wait.

884
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,070
Then what happened to Nimi?

885
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:40,970
Uh oh.

886
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:42,790
Um...

887
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,230
She...

888
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,230
Um...

889
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,890
Should we go to the safe point at the cross?

890
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,950
That's why there were two of you.

891
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,450
One to grab the item and the other to...

892
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,350
No, there was a guy right behind me.

893
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,630
He was blocking the...

894
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,150
The...

895
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,710
The trunk.

896
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,130
We have to go this way.

897
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:56,950
Oh yeah!

898
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,950
That trunk.

899
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,850
All that junk.

900
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,970
Junk in that trunk.

901
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,230
Okay, we got...

902
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,470
Oh wait.

903
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,550
There's a safe point here, right?

904
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:02,770
Yeah.

905
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,470
Oh is there?

906
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:04,230
Yeah.

907
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:05,830
Alright Nimi.

908
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,450
What's it meant to do to you?

909
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,450
Get you drunk.

910
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:09,490
Get you love drunk.

911
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:16,030
You guys have to grab the...

912
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:16,910
The electrical board.

913
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,130
Yeah, where's the electrical box?

914
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,530
It's in the back of the trunk.

915
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,450
We gotta go get...

916
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:20,570
Oh...

917
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:21,950
Oh...

918
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:22,570
Oh...

919
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,770
Oh my god.

920
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,330
Oh my god.

921
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,230
Go, go, go!

922
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,870
I see it.

923
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,010
I see it.

924
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,090
They can't stop all of us.

925
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:31,790
They could.

926
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:32,670
They can.

927
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,570
They could, yeah.

928
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,990
Oh my god.

929
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:47,550
We got it.

930
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:47,970
Yay!

931
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,710
We got to get to the lab.

932
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,350
Wait, no.

933
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:51,810
Oh my god.

934
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,630
He's here?

935
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,330
Oh, wait.

936
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,590
How do we get to the lab?

937
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:56,450
I thought it was this way.

938
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,370
It was the other one.

939
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,390
It was the...

940
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:58,950
Other one?

941
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,130
Remember when we had to go to like...

942
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,550
Yellow women?

943
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,210
What...

944
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,570
What was the plan here?

945
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,970
Look, yellow women had a little like...

946
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,890
There's a little snafu with the yellow women.

947
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,330
Okay.

948
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,610
We had a lot of plans.

949
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,290
We just brought up the wrong plan.

950
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,090
Yeah.

951
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:15,130
Okay.

952
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:15,390
Yeah.

953
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,130
We're following you now.

954
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:17,950
Plan B.

955
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,610
Now we're going to do plan C.

956
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,070
What...

957
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,150
What was plan A?

958
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:26,770
My shift key doesn't work.

959
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,370
Do that!

960
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:28,950
Oh shoot.

961
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,410
Um, we just lost somebody.

962
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,270
Can

963
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,070
we do plan D?

964
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,350
Can we do plan D?

965
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:42,570
Can we do plan D?

966
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,750
This is all part of plan C.

967
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,550
Plan D for Doki and Doki.

968
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:46,770
There you go.

969
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:47,070
See?

970
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,950
Plan C.

971
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,370
All according to plan.

972
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,730
How cool.

973
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:51,830
That's not this way.

974
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,110
That's not the plan part.

975
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:55,650
Slenderman's in there.

976
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,530
Yeah, but this is where we went to the lab.

977
00:30:58,670 --> 00:30:58,810
Remember?

978
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:00,970
Are you running?

979
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,890
Okay, you're good?

980
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,890
I think so.

981
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:03,470
I think so.

982
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:03,950
Okay.

983
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,070
Yeah, it was this one, right?

984
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,130
Or was it the other side?

985
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:09,530
Oh, no.

986
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:09,790
Here.

987
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,090
I don't remember what the objective was.

988
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:14,410
I don't remember.

989
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:15,670
Wait, I remember.

990
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,530
We have to go...

991
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,530
We have to go to the basement.

992
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:19,250
Remember?

993
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,470
And then take another elevator.

994
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,470
Guys, maybe we shouldn't have waited two weeks to do a part two.

995
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,630
Wait, the objectives...

996
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,470
Wait, did we do the safe box on the second floor annex?

997
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,550
Wait, it's all coming back to me.

998
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,270
The safe box?

999
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,270
Oh my...

1000
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,240
I'm dead.

1001
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,260
I just... I just accepted my fate.

1002
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,160
Where did he come from?

1003
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,040
It was like in the elevator.

1004
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,280
Where did he come from?

1005
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,100
I wasn't...

1006
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,320
Yeah, it was the elevator.

1007
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,340
It was like... down here?

1008
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,240
That was so...

1009
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,100
Oh yeah, it was down here.

1010
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,760
Yeah, I trust you.

1011
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,480
Yellow woman with the plan.

1012
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,080
Exactly, I have a plan.

1013
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,100
Yellow woman with the plan.

1014
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,220
Does she?

1015
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,480
Does she now?

1016
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:11,820
Where's she?

1017
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:11,940
Where's she?

1018
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,000
It's so dark in here.

1019
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,060
Here you go.

1020
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:15,480
Hi!

1021
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,860
Alright, and then we take this elevator.

1022
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,320
I'm trying to press the elevator button.

1023
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,460
My item is blind.

1024
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,180
Okay.

1025
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
And then...

1026
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,440
We go to basement two.

1027
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,800
And then we go to another elevator.

1028
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,020
And then we go down.

1029
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:39,600
I...

1030
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
You're saying a lot of shit right now.

1031
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,860
Makes sense to me.

1032
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,560
I get it.

1033
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1034
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,140
You just gotta...

1035
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,800
Okay, the thing is...

1036
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:48,880
I...

1037
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,620
I don't remember which...

1038
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,840
It was this way, right?

1039
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,160
Which way?

1040
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,700
We don't know where you're trying to go.

1041
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,460
I don't think it was this way.

1042
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,520
There's a guy!

1043
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,000
There's a guy!

1044
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,800
There's a guy!

1045
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,920
Oh my god!

1046
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,500
Wait.

1047
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Wait, I'm...

1048
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,160
Give me a sec.

1049
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,760
Wasn't it the main elevator and then you select like a different floor?

1050
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,480
No, no, no.

1051
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,320
Because we had to take two elevators.

1052
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,780
So like, it was from here.

1053
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,760
Now we went to a different...

1054
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,460
Oh, I remember!

1055
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,680
You have said, I remember like five times.

1056
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,760
Review the VOD.

1057
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,360
Review the VOD.

1058
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,920
Remember when we had to run past the other guy?

1059
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,560
This wouldn't have happened if Raze was here.

1060
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:27,900
Yeah.

1061
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,500
Oh, she do be remembered.

1062
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,340
My fellow yellow woman remembered.

1063
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:34,160
We have to run past this guy.

1064
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,280
There's a guy over here, by the way.

1065
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,280
So be careful.

1066
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,640
I don't think we run that way, but...

1067
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,680
He'll get us immediately.

1068
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:39,900
Is it this way?

1069
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,120
He's right there.

1070
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,580
Oh?

1071
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,200
No, it was this way.

1072
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:46,520
He here?

1073
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,560
Yeah, he's coming.

1074
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,240
Maybe not.

1075
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,040
Maybe not.

1076
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:51,700
Is it that way?

1077
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,440
Uh-oh.

1078
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,030
Uh-oh.

1079
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,650
I don't know who died?

1080
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,500
How do I get over there?

1081
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,020
I'm lost!

1082
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,620
It was probably Doobie.

1083
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,820
I'm scared though.

1084
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:28,920
I'm scared.

1085
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,540
Guys, I'm all by myself!

1086
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,020
Wait, I think I have to go though, no?

1087
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,680
Because they need me for the elevator?

1088
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,540
Hey, do I need to come over there?

1089
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:47,900
Hey, do I need to come over there?

1090
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,480
I hear them.

1091
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:53,990
If I die...

1092
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,550
I'm dead.

1093
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,690
I lived!

1094
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,070
Holy moly!

1095
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:08,790
I lived!

1096
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:10,610
I'm the main character!

1097
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,070
I hear them.

1098
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,070
Do I need to come over there?

1099
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,720
Can they hear me?

1100
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,380
Alright, we opened the hatch.

1101
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,400
They opened the hatch.

1102
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,000
They opened the hatch.

1103
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,400
Just running for it.

1104
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,170
You think the move was made out of you, you know?

1105
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,190
Oh!

1106
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,310
Uh...

1107
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:50,610
Hello?

1108
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,210
Oh!

1109
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:52,610
Oh, man!

1110
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:53,290
Hi!

1111
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,610
Yeah, I'm...

1112
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,310
Doobie's dead.

1113
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:57,870
Oh, okay.

1114
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,630
Okay.

1115
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,990
See, you followed the wrong yellow woman.

1116
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,510
I told you I had a plan.

1117
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,010
Is there...

1118
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,310
There's no loyalty here?

1119
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:09,470
No, okay.

1120
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,670
The yellow car plan was my plan.

1121
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,690
She's in charge of the other plan.

1122
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,690
So...

1123
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,890
What was the other plan?

1124
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,130
The other plan was the...

1125
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,210
You didn't even know where the yellow car was.

1126
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,790
I found...

1127
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:24,940
What do you mean?

1128
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,300
I was a hero!

1129
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,180
For the record, I've had survivor's guilt this whole time.

1130
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,860
And I feel...

1131
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,360
No, she did.

1132
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,360
She forgot about you.

1133
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,260
For the record, I could always hear your voice in my head.

1134
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,440
Yeah, I was talking.

1135
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,720
I could hear you guys, too.

1136
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,020
Okay, we gotta...

1137
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,480
We gotta go revive the other yellow woman because she actually has the...

1138
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:48,000
She has the part two of this plan.

1139
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,780
Oh, okay.

1140
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,040
Wait, what did you guys do down there?

1141
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,460
Oh, we opened the hatch for the moon.

1142
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,400
The moon!

1143
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,680
Yeah, yeah.

1144
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,620
We just need to open the second hatch, but...

1145
00:36:58,620 --> 00:36:59,640
Okay, we gotta get out of here first.

1146
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,860
The second yellow woman has part two.

1147
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:01,420
Okay.

1148
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,340
I was only part one.

1149
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,340
Okay.

1150
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,420
I don't wanna die.

1151
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,380
It's too loud.

1152
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,340
How did she die?

1153
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,060
The guy got her.

1154
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,260
So we should avoid that.

1155
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,460
And where is this guy?

1156
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,540
Mr. Slenderman?

1157
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,940
And where is this guy you speak of?

1158
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,460
We could just jump, right?

1159
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,140
Oh, no.

1160
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,860
I won't let us...

1161
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,500
No, I don't...

1162
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,040
No, we have to go through...

1163
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,620
The guy.

1164
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:23,540
So...

1165
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,360
Ladies first.

1166
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,020
I think if you just run for it...

1167
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:31,680
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1168
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,220
There he is!

1169
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,200
He'll only get one of us.

1170
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,340
He'll only get one of us.

1171
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,460
Wrong elevator!

1172
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,360
Wrong elevator!

1173
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:40,940
He can't come in here, I think.

1174
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:41,640
There we go.

1175
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,700
What the heck?

1176
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,430
I can still hear you!

1177
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,530
He can't even come in here!

1178
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,730
No, I was waiting for you guys.

1179
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,410
With the door closed?

1180
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,570
Yeah, for safety.

1181
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,930
Like when you see someone coming down the hall...

1182
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:06,270
...and then yell at me and hit the door close button.

1183
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:06,870
Safe!

1184
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,990
I'm just trying to save energy.

1185
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:09,450
Hey!

1186
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,090
Welcome back!

1187
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,010
Doobie, you're here for part two.

1188
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,630
Part two of the plan.

1189
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,970
Alright, but if you guys make fun of me, I'm not doing the plan.

1190
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,030
No, no, I was saying...

1191
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,650
I heard you!

1192
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:21,110
Yeah!

1193
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,790
No, I was saying that...

1194
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,110
I was...

1195
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,190
Um...

1196
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,790
What do we do?

1197
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:29,790
Oh, shoot.

1198
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,490
Oh...

1199
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,390
He can't come in here!

1200
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:37,530
Oh...

1201
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,510
No, please no!

1202
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:41,350
No, no, no, no!

1203
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:41,810
No, no, no!

1204
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,230
That wasn't me!

1205
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:42,630
Why?

1206
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,630
Who was it?

1207
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,050
Who was it?

1208
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:54,310
Who was it?

1209
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,090
Who was it?

1210
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:56,110
Who said?

1211
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,030
That was my revenge.

1212
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,990
It might have been deserved.

1213
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,090
Honestly.

1214
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,530
I was like, you can't come over here!

1215
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,870
How do we get back to like the annex anyways?

1216
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,030
It's the...

1217
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:13,150
We gotta go outside, though.

1218
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:13,570
We gotta go up.

1219
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:13,850
Yeah.

1220
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:14,590
We gotta go outside.

1221
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:15,930
Watch out for him.

1222
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,490
He's a sneaky one, that guy.

1223
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:18,730
We'll just...

1224
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:19,870
Yeah, that was very...

1225
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:28,370
Oh!

1226
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:29,830
Keep going!

1227
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,200
Oh, shoot.

1228
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,880
This is a dead end.

1229
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:35,320
Oh, wait.

1230
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:35,700
No, it's not.

1231
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:42,750
Um...

1232
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:43,250
Okay, cool.

1233
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,850
Oh!

1234
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,890
Was it Doobie?

1235
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,360
Somebody's at the same point.

1236
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,800
Well, she should come to our save point.

1237
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,320
Yeah.

1238
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,060
She should come to our save point.

1239
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,100
We're the ones here.

1240
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,400
Maybe we don't go up these stairs.

1241
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,600
Maybe we...

1242
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,600
We

1243
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,450
won.

1244
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:19,610
Yeah, it's 2v1.

1245
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,290
We can win.

1246
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,830
We'll just wait until she's dead.

1247
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:26,810
Yeah.

1248
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:27,450
Yeah.

1249
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,850
I don't actually even know where she is.

1250
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,070
It might be a while.

1251
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,210
I don't know.

1252
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:33,110
Did she go outside?

1253
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,300
I think she went this way.

1254
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,660
Yeah.

1255
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,360
Upstairs?

1256
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,640
Upstairs?

1257
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,640
Wait, where'd you go?

1258
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,500
Oh, I was down here.

1259
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,180
Maybe...

1260
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,840
Yeah, maybe over here.

1261
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,920
Can we go outside this way?

1262
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,280
Yeah.

1263
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,780
I think there's like the front door around here.

1264
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,140
Oh.

1265
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,260
Right here?

1266
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1267
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,380
Um...

1268
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,420
Wait, how do we get around?

1269
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:06,980
Where is she?

1270
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,760
You think she's at the other save point?

1271
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,780
The one outside that we started at?

1272
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:12,540
Oh!

1273
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,760
Maybe.

1274
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,460
Wait, oh, but this is a dead end.

1275
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,200
We can't get over here.

1276
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,740
I think we have to go through the building.

1277
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:19,840
Oh.

1278
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:19,940
Okay.

1279
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,400
Okay.

1280
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,200
Um...

1281
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,380
Can we open this?

1282
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,680
I'm gonna see if this opens.

1283
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,340
Oh, good.

1284
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:29,600
Yeah.

1285
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,380
Oh.

1286
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,340
Is it a shortcut?

1287
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,140
No, but it's good to have...

1288
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,100
Oh, there's the inky guy.

1289
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,580
Little ink blob guy.

1290
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,020
Oh, gosh.

1291
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1292
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,040
Yeah.

1293
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,000
Oh, I see her.

1294
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,460
I see her.

1295
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,780
Don't worry.

1296
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,760
I know where to go.

1297
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,080
I was waiting for you guys.

1298
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,440
Okay.

1299
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,440
We need doobie though.

1300
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,120
We need doobie.

1301
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1302
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,560
There's a safe station right here.

1303
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,500
Okay.

1304
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,240
Yeah.

1305
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,600
Part two of Plan C.

1306
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,060
Okay.

1307
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,280
Okay.

1308
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,480
All right.

1309
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,100
All right, doobie.

1310
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:02,680
Hi.

1311
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,480
You're trying to shine.

1312
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,300
Hi.

1313
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,540
Follow me.

1314
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,340
Oh, we're going back in here?

1315
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:07,940
Oh, no.

1316
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,460
Oh, no.

1317
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,720
She had to research part two.

1318
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,320
And I was...

1319
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,620
Oh, I hear him.

1320
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,040
I hear him.

1321
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,420
I hear him.

1322
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,100
Okay.

1323
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:15,600
Don't worry.

1324
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:15,960
I'll...

1325
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,720
I'll meet them.

1326
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,230
I'll...

1327
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:21,250
Wait, I think the stairs are through that room.

1328
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,450
Okay.

1329
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,630
I think I don't know.

1330
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,450
Oh.

1331
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,030
It's squishy in here.

1332
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:30,090
Oh,

1333
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,910
the stairs I think are over...

1334
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,270
Right here.

1335
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,510
Okay, wait.

1336
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,850
Hold on.

1337
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,650
Let me check something.

1338
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,910
Dad, I lost him.

1339
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,550
You lost him?

1340
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:41,390
You lost him?

1341
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:42,690
I can't see anything.

1342
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:43,270
Oh gosh.

1343
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:44,750
Hello.

1344
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:45,430
I don't know.

1345
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:46,050
Oh, hey.

1346
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:50,750
Hey, I'm looking for the room that has all the canisters down here that we did when we first...

1347
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:51,610
Did this?

1348
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,370
Oh, the room with green lines.

1349
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,430
Oh.

1350
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:55,790
Oh.

1351
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:57,090
I...

1352
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,270
I didn't research that part.

1353
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,150
I left it to you.

1354
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,570
No, no, no, no.

1355
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,510
It's already the part that we did.

1356
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,670
It's just I need to find it.

1357
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,050
Okay.

1358
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:06,030
Isn't it too...

1359
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,350
Isn't it up there...

1360
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,470
To the right and then left?

1361
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:09,590
Upstairs?

1362
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:11,950
Oh, there he is.

1363
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:12,590
There he is.

1364
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,350
You found it?

1365
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:17,070
Are we alive though?

1366
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:18,870
Yeah.

1367
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:19,690
I lost everybody?

1368
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:20,410
Yeah.

1369
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:22,370
How?

1370
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:28,280
Why am I always lost?

1371
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,540
She's dead.

1372
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:34,360
Who's dead?

1373
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,840
Um...

1374
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,520
She's dead.

1375
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:40,920
Oh shoot.

1376
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:46,900
I can't see!

1377
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,000
You're alive.

1378
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,240
Hello!

1379
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:55,920
Hi!

1380
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I think...

1381
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,700
I think we lost one, but...

1382
00:43:58,700 --> 00:43:59,820
Yeah, I think we lost...

1383
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:00,840
Oh, I just gotta find the room again.

1384
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,480
I think it was...

1385
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,860
Oh, it was...

1386
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:07,720
Yeah, through here and then over here.

1387
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,380
Oh gosh, I'm trapped.

1388
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:12,760
Oh, who just died?

1389
00:44:18,830 --> 00:44:19,230
I'm dead.

1390
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:19,510
I think I'm dead.

1391
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,820
Look at them hips.

1392
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:33,800
Damn, girl.

1393
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:36,740
I'm here!

1394
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,300
Hi.

1395
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,900
He just walked that way.

1396
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:40,560
He just walked that way.

1397
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,920
Oh, are you just been hiding here?

1398
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:43,720
The entire time?

1399
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:44,860
Not the entire time.

1400
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,700
I just hid here now.

1401
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,480
Why'd you shut the door?

1402
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,700
So I'm trying to put...

1403
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,320
Okay, I think Mimi and Doobie are dead.

1404
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,200
So we have to go back.

1405
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:53,620
Okay.

1406
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,340
Fine by me.

1407
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,520
Get me out of here.

1408
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,960
I'm pretty sure they're dead.

1409
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,940
I think so too.

1410
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,200
Hello!

1411
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,020
I pushed it a little bit.

1412
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,680
I know where it's to move from.

1413
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,960
I think there's a way to go upstairs.

1414
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,120
It's like right by the room.

1415
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,780
Uh...

1416
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,200
Yeah, it's

1417
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:18,590
just...

1418
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,010
Oh, is he over there?

1419
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:21,510
I don't know.

1420
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,590
It's right here.

1421
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:24,870
We're gonna be pushed upstairs.

1422
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:25,270
Oh.

1423
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:26,410
He's here, he's here, he's here!

1424
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:29,510
He's fencing.

1425
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:30,470
He's fencing?

1426
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:31,490
Yeah.

1427
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:34,610
Oh my god!

1428
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:36,230
He was taken off!

1429
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:44,930
We're distracting him?

1430
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:45,850
Kinda?

1431
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,050
Kinda?

1432
00:45:47,850 --> 00:45:48,770
We lost him?

1433
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:48,810
We lost him?

1434
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,430
He's around here somewhere.

1435
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:51,730
Yeah.

1436
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,250
Where is he?

1437
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:53,210
Where is he?

1438
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:54,310
Oh!

1439
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,290
Nimi's got him!

1440
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:55,590
Okay.

1441
00:45:56,110 --> 00:45:57,050
Nimi, you got him?

1442
00:45:58,370 --> 00:45:59,250
Nimi is...

1443
00:45:59,250 --> 00:45:59,990
Alive.

1444
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:00,490
Probably.

1445
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:01,590
Is he alive?

1446
00:46:02,570 --> 00:46:03,330
Yeah, I hear.

1447
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:03,770
I hear.

1448
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:04,130
I hear.

1449
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:04,150
I hear.

1450
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,710
What can I do?

1451
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:08,970
I'm just standing here.

1452
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,020
I'm here?

1453
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:17,560
I'm...

1454
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:17,840
I'm...

1455
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,980
I think it's already upstairs.

1456
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,020
I got one of them upstairs.

1457
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,040
Okay.

1458
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,720
I'm pushing, I'm pushing.

1459
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,460
But I don't know where to go after that.

1460
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,200
Oh.

1461
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:28,220
Oh.

1462
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,320
Pull.

1463
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:29,700
Okay.

1464
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,120
Is that all of them?

1465
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,320
Nope, there's no pull.

1466
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,280
There we go.

1467
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:33,820
Oh, it does.

1468
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1469
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:39,420
Okay.

1470
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,100
What happened to the other one?

1471
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:41,640
Okay, wait, wait.

1472
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,160
Let's see him.

1473
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:42,900
Nimi is...

1474
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,020
Hey!

1475
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:43,940
What the hell?

1476
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,920
Wait, let's see if Nimi died or not.

1477
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,720
Cause I don't think she's alive.

1478
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:50,720
What?

1479
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:51,280
Are we gonna save?

1480
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:51,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1481
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,060
Yeah, I think it'd be good too.

1482
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,860
Yeah, I have to leave you instead.

1483
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:55,840
Wee!

1484
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:55,880
Alright.

1485
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,260
Follow Nimi.

1486
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,100
Her sacrifice is not in vain.

1487
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,560
Alright, so...

1488
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,080
What I...

1489
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,200
Realize...

1490
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,980
It like pushes the monster away.

1491
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:05,240
Oh!

1492
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:05,960
Oh!

1493
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,280
Oh!

1494
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,020
Hopefully that guy doesn't come up here, and then we just push these into the right spot.

1495
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,220
I think he will though.

1496
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:12,760
I don't know if he goes...

1497
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,500
He might go backwards though, so...

1498
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,020
Watch out behind you.

1499
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,340
Oh, you might like change direction?

1500
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:18,780
Yeah.

1501
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:19,820
I think he...

1502
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,200
Probably does.

1503
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,140
I'm scared.

1504
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:22,760
Me too!

1505
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:23,860
This is scary!

1506
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:25,820
We should get...

1507
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,320
Somebody should get in between the canisters and then...

1508
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,000
Yeah, yeah, I'm in between.

1509
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,240
We actually need to be in for it and I'll be back.

1510
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,300
Cause...

1511
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,100
Cause you know where to go.

1512
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:33,500
Oh, he's coming!

1513
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:33,520
He's coming!

1514
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:34,120
He's coming!

1515
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,740
Oh...

1516
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,260
Oh God!

1517
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,480
Oh shoot!

1518
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,080
Oh gosh.

1519
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,300
I went the wrong...

1520
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:50,580
Oh, no.

1521
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:50,960
I'm good.

1522
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:54,840
This way?

1523
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:55,440
Oh shoot.

1524
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,800
I can't see anything here.

1525
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:57,660
Wait.

1526
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,060
This way is the safe point!

1527
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,260
This way, this way.

1528
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,700
Yeah, yeah.

1529
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,820
We're back.

1530
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,460
Okay, it only works in the hallway, I guess.

1531
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,820
Okay.

1532
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:09,760
Okay.

1533
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,100
We'll wait for him to pass.

1534
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,040
Then we'll go back.

1535
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,320
Okay.

1536
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:14,840
Like for that guy.

1537
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:15,440
I hear him.

1538
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:17,840
Someone has to bait him out of here.

1539
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:20,940
This guy sucks.

1540
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,500
I saw him run fastest!

1541
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,630
Let's go and let somebody lead him away.

1542
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:31,550
I'm probably not meeting him.

1543
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:32,630
Go!

1544
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:33,390
Go!

1545
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:33,870
Go!

1546
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,110
Someone, I need to push this.

1547
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:36,770
He's here!

1548
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:37,090
He's here!

1549
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:37,770
I'm trapped?

1550
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:38,730
I'm trapped?

1551
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,250
Oh, it's okay.

1552
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:42,070
He's trapped too.

1553
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:42,430
Wait.

1554
00:48:42,610 --> 00:48:43,310
Oh, no it's not!

1555
00:48:45,310 --> 00:48:46,270
Wyrm, Wyrm!

1556
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:52,130
Oh my god, I think two people just got got.

1557
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:54,130
Yep, it's all Doobie.

1558
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:55,830
It's all Doobie!

1559
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,250
Sure looks like Team Green is carrying.

1560
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:03,830
My throat is hurting a little bit today.

1561
00:49:04,130 --> 00:49:05,470
Maybe I overdid it yesterday.

1562
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,390
I'm gonna take some...

1563
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:11,590
Okay.

1564
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:12,470
Sign.

1565
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:14,190
Throat.

1566
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,850
Syrup.

1567
00:49:15,030 --> 00:49:15,850
Alright, round two!

1568
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,650
Just kidding.

1569
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:18,350
Round two!

1570
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:19,010
Okay.

1571
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:20,730
One of the canisters is in there.

1572
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:21,790
Yay!

1573
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:22,310
Okay.

1574
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:25,970
I'm pushing it with you.

1575
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,750
Push, push, push, push.

1576
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:32,450
I see a red line, yeah, over here.

1577
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:34,290
I'll go for that one.

1578
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,350
Is it...

1579
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,810
Over here in this corner.

1580
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:41,550
Oh, over here, over here.

1581
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,250
There's one over here too.

1582
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,350
There's one more over here.

1583
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:44,830
Oh, go this way?

1584
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:45,090
This way.

1585
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:45,390
Okay.

1586
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:45,930
Yeah.

1587
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:48,890
Oh, I see it.

1588
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:49,850
Yeah, there he is.

1589
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:50,510
See, we got it.

1590
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:50,990
Ay!

1591
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:52,250
Ay!

1592
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:55,670
So now there's just one more.

1593
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:56,570
Last one's here, last one's here!

1594
00:49:58,430 --> 00:49:59,470
Yo, yo, yo, you!

1595
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:00,490
I believe.

1596
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:01,770
If you can crawl under here!

1597
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:02,370
Yahoo!

1598
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:02,990
Woo-hoo!

1599
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,310
Alright, let's go save before.

1600
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:05,070
We won, we won.

1601
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:06,150
Yeah, let's go save.

1602
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:06,690
Go save!

1603
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:07,310
Go save!

1604
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:08,870
I've got the dynamite.

1605
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:11,390
You can go this way.

1606
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:12,330
Follow.

1607
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:15,050
Don't go this way!

1608
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,290
Don't go that way.

1609
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:18,450
Don't go that way.

1610
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:19,650
Don't go that way!

1611
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,710
Is it this way?

1612
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:23,010
Yeah, I did it this way.

1613
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:24,010
Baby.

1614
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,090
Is this the dynamite?

1615
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:25,510
No.

1616
00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:26,610
This is the dynamite.

1617
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:27,730
I can place it now.

1618
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:28,190
I can place it.

1619
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:28,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1620
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:29,250
Oh my god.

1621
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:30,390
Maybe there's a save point over there.

1622
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,170
Nice, nice, nice.

1623
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,770
There's got to be a save point here.

1624
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:38,490
Yeah, there has to be a save point right here, right?

1625
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,330
What's all that?

1626
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:40,270
Oh, yeah, yeah, there we go.

1627
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:40,510
Ew.

1628
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:43,310
It's... No, it's... It's COVID.

1629
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,890
Okay, Mimi's still alive.

1630
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:48,610
What's that sound?

1631
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:49,090
Oh.

1632
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,870
Because we all saw Mint die, so...

1633
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:52,690
Yeah, yeah.

1634
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:53,410
Yeah.

1635
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:53,710
Yes.

1636
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,450
This stuff doesn't kill us?

1637
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:56,450
No, no.

1638
00:50:56,650 --> 00:50:56,950
It's weird.

1639
00:50:57,370 --> 00:50:57,570
It's weird.

1640
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:58,090
Hello.

1641
00:50:59,330 --> 00:50:59,810
Hello.

1642
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:00,630
Hello.

1643
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,010
I'm about to be revived.

1644
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:03,690
Revive me.

1645
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:04,890
A new area.

1646
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:05,450
Yeah.

1647
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,210
I don't know what to do past here, but we'll figure it out.

1648
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,230
I... Remembers.

1649
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:10,890
Oh.

1650
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,470
Whoa.

1651
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:12,570
Oh.

1652
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:13,950
It's your wife, Mint.

1653
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,310
But she's... Oh my god.

1654
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,270
Stranger lady.

1655
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:19,030
She's here.

1656
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:19,830
Yeah.

1657
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:21,030
Read us the dialogue.

1658
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,350
You actually made it.

1659
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,050
That horned beast had it out for you.

1660
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,730
A real nasty piece of work.

1661
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,130
And don't even get me started on that worm.

1662
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,550
Any worm.

1663
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:34,890
Yeah, what a worm.

1664
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:35,950
Yeah, what a worm.

1665
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,090
Good job not dying.

1666
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:38,550
Yeah, we totally didn't die.

1667
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:40,910
Zero deaths, guys.

1668
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:42,130
Oh, that's all.

1669
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:43,310
Oh.

1670
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:44,110
Oh, really?

1671
00:51:45,250 --> 00:51:46,030
Zero deaths.

1672
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:46,710
Not very informative.

1673
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:49,970
Alright, that was my plan, and uh, that's all I got.

1674
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,390
We have a, we have a, what's it called?

1675
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:53,330
Wait, he has no head.

1676
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:54,630
Oh.

1677
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:57,530
Oh, wait, I think we can put something here now.

1678
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,630
Is that the alien from the, the, you know, the Mexico alien?

1679
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:02,070
Yeah.

1680
00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:03,150
Yeah, the, oh.

1681
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:10,410
I bet if we swap the other TV guy's head with an orange.

1682
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:11,310
What does this do?

1683
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:12,410
Oh, the second floor.

1684
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,610
Yeah, we can do it.

1685
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:14,330
Oh.

1686
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:14,350
Oh.

1687
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,610
I turned it on.

1688
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,650
TV head with no head.

1689
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:21,530
No head.

1690
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:25,150
There's another guy.

1691
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:26,710
There's two of them.

1692
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,830
Two of them, two of them, two of them, two of them.

1693
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,250
There's two TV heads with no head.

1694
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,710
Not working.

1695
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:36,110
This is that one area with a guy that's in the circle.

1696
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:39,270
So this is, this area is the new area.

1697
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:42,250
I wonder if we have to take the canisters from up there down here.

1698
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:43,070
Probably.

1699
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,070
I haven't fully explored this area though.

1700
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,690
We can fly a TV with no head.

1701
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:48,770
Yeah, there's two of them.

1702
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:49,050
Oh.

1703
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:51,470
Yeah, I think this is where we came from.

1704
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,710
Oh, the lights.

1705
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:55,650
Can we go to the, is there another area here?

1706
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,150
Close on the other side.

1707
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,570
The beach, we're not right.

1708
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:03,790
Do we explore everything?

1709
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,450
If we only get us one area, we didn't.

1710
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:07,910
Oh, what the heck?

1711
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:09,590
Oh, come on.

1712
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:11,370
Why?

1713
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,810
Maybe because we opened one of those doors.

1714
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:14,470
Oh.

1715
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,070
Oh.

1716
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:18,690
I hear him breathing.

1717
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:20,350
All right.

1718
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:20,950
Oh, no.

1719
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:22,870
Come back.

1720
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:26,010
Do we explore everything in, in this area?

1721
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,550
I feel like there's something we missed.

1722
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,110
Yeah, then we missed an area.

1723
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:31,590
I'm pretty sure.

1724
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,610
Or the second floor?

1725
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:33,950
Is this the second floor?

1726
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:36,890
Can we go this way?

1727
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,230
The second floor?

1728
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,430
No, we didn't go this way, guys.

1729
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:40,110
Oh, yeah.

1730
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:40,850
Over here.

1731
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,890
Yeah.

1732
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:42,750
Oh, my gosh.

1733
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:43,610
The worms scared me.

1734
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:45,810
Oh, okay.

1735
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:46,650
Nothing here.

1736
00:53:46,750 --> 00:53:47,930
It's just an empty room.

1737
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:51,730
There's so many rooms here.

1738
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:52,570
Oh, this is a, oh, this is a circle.

1739
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:53,230
This is a circle.

1740
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:54,530
Oh, we opened.

1741
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,890
Oh, yeah.

1742
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:55,790
We need the gun.

1743
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,550
Oh, oh, we gotta go.

1744
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,050
Oh, wait, isn't that other area that opened up?

1745
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,130
Yeah, we go straight to the third floor and grab the gun.

1746
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:07,070
Maybe we should save that one.

1747
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:07,930
Yeah, yeah.

1748
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:09,310
Save it?

1749
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:09,790
Okay.

1750
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,630
What, there's a, there's a gun on the third floor?

1751
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:13,950
The vending machine?

1752
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,030
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1753
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,910
See, we're sinking with portals now.

1754
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,350
Why is this guy here, though?

1755
00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:21,270
I'm scared of him.

1756
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,250
I think he, like, came from...

1757
00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:24,950
Where did he go?

1758
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:25,510
Yeah.

1759
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:27,870
Oh, we're here.

1760
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:29,050
Okay, okay.

1761
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:31,570
Oh, it's a big ol' loot.

1762
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:34,110
Yeah, um, you get the gun and I'll grab the lamp.

1763
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:35,250
Okay.

1764
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,110
All right.

1765
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,290
Don't worry, I'll light our paths now.

1766
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:42,670
We got this, guys.

1767
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,710
We're gonna save the moon.

1768
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,970
We're gonna save the moon.

1769
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,450
We need our tidal wave.

1770
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:50,650
To the other side.

1771
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,210
This way.

1772
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:52,250
Yeah, all the way to the end.

1773
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:54,410
Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't worry.

1774
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:55,710
I'm lining the path.

1775
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,670
I got that spear.

1776
00:54:58,810 --> 00:54:59,230
What?

1777
00:54:59,250 --> 00:54:59,410
What?

1778
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,630
I thought someone just died right behind.

1779
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:04,830
It was so dark.

1780
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:07,150
Oh my god.

1781
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:08,070
Oh, this.

1782
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:10,550
Wait, there's a little hole here.

1783
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:12,670
Go in there.

1784
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,490
I go in this little hole.

1785
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:15,170
A man?

1786
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,850
Oh, there's more stairs here.

1787
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,830
It's over on this side.

1788
00:55:20,830 --> 00:55:20,930
Yeah.

1789
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,730
Orange heads cannot hear.

1790
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:25,330
Oh.

1791
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:26,810
What's an orange head?

1792
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:27,990
It's the...

1793
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:28,950
It's the orbs.

1794
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:29,810
The COVID orbs.

1795
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:30,510
Oh.

1796
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,910
Wait, why is...

1797
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:32,950
Why is that guy here?

1798
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:34,470
Oh, there's a TV here.

1799
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:35,630
I found a TV.

1800
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:37,010
Oh, put it on his head.

1801
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:37,250
Put it on his head.

1802
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,150
Yeah, we gotta go find...

1803
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:38,990
Where is he?

1804
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:39,890
Um...

1805
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,050
He's on the bottom floor.

1806
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:42,970
I mean, the next floor.

1807
00:55:42,970 --> 00:55:43,730
This way, this way.

1808
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,290
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1809
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,070
You lead the way.

1810
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:48,190
We can...

1811
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:48,930
Okay, watch out.

1812
00:55:52,310 --> 00:55:53,310
We can go for him.

1813
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,810
Over here.

1814
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,710
Yeah, yeah, there he is.

1815
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:56,150
Here's one.

1816
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,390
He's alive!

1817
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,090
We did it.

1818
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:04,730
Oh, he's sad.

1819
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:05,670
Be happy.

1820
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:06,170
Yeah.

1821
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:06,550
Oh.

1822
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:07,010
Oh.

1823
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:07,790
Excuse me.

1824
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:08,610
You said, oh.

1825
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:10,530
Hey.

1826
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:11,270
Hey, hi.

1827
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,870
It seems you're not infected.

1828
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:17,050
The little black liquid creatures didn't catch you.

1829
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:20,530
But I remember the times before the moon was brought here.

1830
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,570
Back then, there were no creatures.

1831
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:24,790
Everything was just empty.

1832
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:25,870
Oh.

1833
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:26,930
Oh.

1834
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:28,350
Oh, oh, oh.

1835
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,510
What?

1836
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:30,190
He's gone.

1837
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:31,950
So the moon is evil.

1838
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,990
The moon is evil.

1839
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:35,210
We should save real quick.

1840
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,110
Yeah, we should save.

1841
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:36,810
Oh, good idea.

1842
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:40,930
I'm spreading this information.

1843
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,390
Alright, let's go back to the...

1844
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:44,650
He's not a little creature, though.

1845
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:47,050
Let's go back to that area.

1846
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,270
Wait, is this one here or the other way?

1847
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,730
I think it was the other way, right?

1848
00:56:50,050 --> 00:56:50,490
Yeah, okay.

1849
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:50,870
Okay.

1850
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:52,790
Hi!

1851
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:53,710
He he.

1852
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:57,650
I hear him.

1853
00:56:57,650 --> 00:56:58,430
I hear him breathing.

1854
00:56:59,430 --> 00:57:00,910
But I think it's a place we made open.

1855
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,790
Moon's haunted.

1856
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:04,710
And then...

1857
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:06,150
We go...

1858
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:08,430
Oh, do you hear that?

1859
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:09,730
Easter egg.

1860
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:10,790
Do we...

1861
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:11,670
Do we drop down?

1862
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:12,330
Oh.

1863
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:12,870
Oh.

1864
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:14,510
Why not?

1865
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,510
We can go up the stairs, if you go that way, to the...

1866
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:19,530
Left, I think?

1867
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:20,590
Is there anything else in here?

1868
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:21,830
How do I get back?

1869
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:22,690
I don't know.

1870
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,070
Do you think we can get to the other side?

1871
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:27,750
I don't remember.

1872
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:28,930
I don't know.

1873
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:29,810
I'm still lost.

1874
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:30,750
Oh!

1875
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,410
They're too fast, and why the hell are they walking on the ceiling?

1876
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:35,190
Oh, no.

1877
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:36,650
One of them spotted...

1878
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:38,090
Oh!

1879
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:39,570
It's the Covids!

1880
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,750
Oh, it's the laboratory.

1881
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,190
Oh, Doobie went the right way.

1882
00:57:42,450 --> 00:57:43,710
Hey, how do we get back?

1883
00:57:46,290 --> 00:57:47,730
How do we get back?

1884
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:53,790
I don't...

1885
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:54,570
I lost Doobie.

1886
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:55,590
Oh, there...

1887
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:55,930
Nevermind.

1888
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,410
Must be a moon here.

1889
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:02,130
Where exactly?

1890
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:03,630
Oh, this is from the moon?

1891
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,660
Maybe you guys should die.

1892
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:09,820
Why?

1893
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,140
Actually, we don't know where a save point is, though.

1894
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,640
Don't die.

1895
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,140
What is that sound?

1896
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:32,900
Why is it so liquidy?

1897
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:34,840
Hello?

1898
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:35,540
Hi.

1899
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:36,420
There's a whole...

1900
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,800
There's like a maze area over here, but...

1901
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,200
Wait, wait.

1902
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,160
There's a save point right here.

1903
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:41,460
Yeah.

1904
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,260
Can you guys die?

1905
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:43,800
Hello?

1906
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:43,900
Hello?

1907
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,940
Oh, I'll go tell him.

1908
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,800
I'll go tell him to die.

1909
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,220
Okay.

1910
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:49,360
Uh-oh.

1911
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,000
Uh-oh.

1912
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:50,220
Uh-oh.

1913
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:50,820
Uh-oh.

1914
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:51,820
Die!

1915
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:52,760
Die!

1916
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:53,740
Die!

1917
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:54,440
Die!

1918
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:55,100
Oh, shit.

1919
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:55,520
I'm dead.

1920
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:02,400
He came after me.

1921
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,860
I have COVID.

1922
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,860
Oh wait, everybody's dead.

1923
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:09,500
He's dead.

1924
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,140
Oh my gosh.

1925
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:15,520
Watch out for COVID.

1926
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:16,240
He's here.

1927
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,760
Okay, one of us leads him away.

1928
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,700
You can't hear, right?

1929
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,780
Wait, wait, there's dark, there's dark.

1930
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:25,520
Doobie, doobie, doobie.

1931
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:28,700
Oh my gosh, he scared me.

1932
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:31,100
I wish I could smash those orange heads.

1933
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:33,760
Oh, that's another shortcut?

1934
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:38,800
I'm so dead.

1935
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:02,000
Wait, wait a second.

1936
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:03,620
Wait, are we gonna lose that?

1937
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:04,700
Are we gonna die?

1938
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,820
Okay, we have to unlock that area again.

1939
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,360
Yeah, but do you have the gun?

1940
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:11,100
No, maybe we should leave it closed, right?

1941
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:11,540
Right!

1942
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:13,940
Oh yeah, yeah, we should leave it closed.

1943
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:14,860
Yeah, you're right.

1944
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:15,460
So true.

1945
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,860
I have, I haven't...

1946
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,660
Oh yeah, and then... Oh, okay, good, good, good.

1947
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:20,940
Oh, this way?

1948
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,960
I think there's, there's like the orange guy.

1949
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,040
We gotta sneak past him.

1950
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,700
Oh yeah, cause he can't get down.

1951
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:27,660
So he can sneak it.

1952
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:32,420
Oh, I hear that guy breathing on the other side.

1953
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:33,340
Ooh.

1954
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:34,360
He's right there.

1955
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,800
Does that mean it could see us?

1956
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,300
Yeah, it will see you.

1957
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,140
And he's fast.

1958
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:38,840
He will get you.

1959
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,120
Oh shoot.

1960
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:04,390
Oh shoot.

1961
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:05,150
Wait, what's this?

1962
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:05,790
Oh.

1963
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:07,810
The password is somewhere nearby!

1964
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:09,010
Oh my God!

1965
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:13,470
The password is somewhere nearby.

1966
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,480
Oh, nice!

1967
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:22,940
Good job, Doobie!

1968
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:27,520
I heard Min's final words were like, Password is somewhere near.

1969
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:29,860
Password?

1970
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:30,960
Who killed me?

1971
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,940
Who's, who's sloppy body?

1972
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:33,780
Who's...

1973
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,320
Okay.

1974
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,340
Our hero, Doobie.

1975
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,560
We can't look at them too long or the...

1976
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,800
Our fans get angry.

1977
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,400
Alright, Doobie, what's the plan?

1978
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:49,640
Doobie, you're muted!

1979
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,100
Oh my God!

1980
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,190
Everybody there?

1981
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:10,550
No.

1982
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:16,960
I hear him breathing.

1983
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,520
I saw him over there.

1984
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,840
I'm trapped a little bit.

1985
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:04,360
I'm trapped.

1986
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,160
I'm kind of trapped in here though.

1987
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,620
Wait, I don't think that was the way to go anyway.

1988
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:10,640
It was back here, right?

1989
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:11,200
Or is it?

1990
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:12,060
Oh wait, no, it was here.

1991
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:13,140
Yeah.

1992
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:15,300
I think we are supposed to pass.

1993
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:17,960
What am I saying?

1994
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:21,360
How about one of us bait them out and then the others run around?

1995
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,000
You can, yeah, you can like kind of run past them.

1996
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:24,780
You just gotta be careful.

1997
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:25,540
Oh.

1998
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:26,520
You can be the user's laptop.

1999
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:27,520
You don't know the parents.

2000
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,510
Is that the password is around here somewhere?

2001
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:40,910
Oh my God.

2002
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:45,780
Oh shoot.

2003
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:56,840
Can they not come in here?

2004
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:58,700
Hey, guys, hey?

2005
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,360
Hey!

2006
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:00,640
I don't think they can come in here.

2007
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,020
Wait.

2008
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,160
Is every... Wait.

2009
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:03,540
Shoot.

2010
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:04,720
No.

2011
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:06,460
Okay.

2012
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,520
I keep saying that, huh?

2013
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,060
I can't come in here.

2014
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:09,900
Uh-oh.

2015
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,000
Come close.

2016
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:26,940
What?

2017
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,480
Okay, guys, take a picture.

2018
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,620
Actually, take a picture.

2019
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,680
Wait, what does it say?

2020
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:33,300
Let me see it.

2021
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:36,140
Five, one, one, two, one, five, one.

2022
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,260
Holy hell, okay.

2023
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:38,760
Five, one, one.

2024
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:39,260
Okay, we're...

2025
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,620
Okay, so like, where's the safe box?

2026
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,680
I know where it is.

2027
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,740
Well, kind of... Oh, okay.

2028
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,300
I have seen it with my eyes.

2029
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:49,820
Okay, it's fine.

2030
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:50,740
Nimi was a hero.

2031
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:52,840
She's... Watch out, watch out, watch out.

2032
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:53,660
She's dead?

2033
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:54,240
She was a hero.

2034
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:57,920
Nimi, I'm trying to bring you home.

2035
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:58,860
Okay.

2036
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,620
All right, let's just... Let's just try for it.

2037
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,360
I think I hear it.

2038
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:08,900
Is this it?

2039
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:11,940
I'm gonna die.

2040
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:13,220
You're gonna die?

2041
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:13,520
Okay.

2042
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:13,760
Oh, oh.

2043
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:16,080
Okay, we'll bring you back.

2044
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:16,780
Oh, shoot.

2045
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,380
The little slime creature.

2046
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:19,620
All right, we'll bring you back.

2047
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:20,760
We found the password.

2048
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:22,240
Nice.

2049
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:23,020
Yeah.

2050
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:23,520
Yay.

2051
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,240
You know where the safe... The safe box is, though.

2052
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:27,180
I... Oh.

2053
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,680
I... I... I ran past it once.

2054
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:31,680
Is it way too long?

2055
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:33,980
It is a very long password.

2056
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,380
No, it is very, very long.

2057
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:37,480
Watch out, there's a little slime guy in here, too.

2058
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,640
As long as we don't look at him.

2059
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:38,640
What?

2060
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,280
You guys know where the safe box is?

2061
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:43,780
Min says she knows where it is.

2062
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:48,920
Well... Uh... I'm stuck on... One at a... One at a time, guys.

2063
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:50,500
There can only be one.

2064
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,840
Did we... Did we lose her?

2065
01:05:53,660 --> 01:05:54,460
Yeah, yeah.

2066
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:55,220
We'll go back.

2067
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,320
No, I don't think so.

2068
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:56,480
Oh.

2069
01:05:56,780 --> 01:05:57,280
Yes, she did.

2070
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:58,340
Oh, yeah.

2071
01:05:58,540 --> 01:06:01,440
There's... You two, like, stuff each other.

2072
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:04,420
I didn't see anyone next to me, so...

2073
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,640
I ran.

2074
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:06,640
Oh.

2075
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:06,700
I ran.

2076
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:08,820
Oh my god.

2077
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:09,520
No, no, no.

2078
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:09,900
Go back.

2079
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:10,180
Go back.

2080
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:23,300
Go back.

2081
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:23,760
Hello, everybody!

2082
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,280
Oh my god, the slime!

2083
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,280
Run from the slime!

2084
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,060
Oh my god.

2085
01:06:29,980 --> 01:06:32,040
Okay, is this the second floor?

2086
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,660
This is the second floor.

2087
01:06:35,720 --> 01:06:38,100
Is the safe in our room?

2088
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,700
Have we seen the safe before?

2089
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:42,500
I don't remember.

2090
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,980
There was one next to the map, but it didn't have this many digits.

2091
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:53,140
There was something green that I was by, and that's where it said the password is close to here, and it was in that room.

2092
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:53,600
Oh!

2093
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,640
Oh, okay!

2094
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:55,180
Yeah, yeah.

2095
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:55,560
Think!

2096
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:56,080
Think!

2097
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,760
It was upstairs in that room, though.

2098
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,180
Okay.

2099
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,100
Okay, we can do this.

2100
01:07:01,220 --> 01:07:03,120
We just gotta have to invade the guy again.

2101
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:03,380
Go!

2102
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,800
Go!

2103
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:04,420
Go!

2104
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:04,820
Go!

2105
01:07:05,140 --> 01:07:05,140
Go!

2106
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:05,440
Go!

2107
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:05,520
Go!

2108
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:05,680
Go!

2109
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,660
Oh my god!

2110
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:13,760
Oh wait, this is the first floor.

2111
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:14,200
Yeah.

2112
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,360
Uh, where was the save point here?

2113
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:17,940
I don't remember.

2114
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:18,980
Oh my god.

2115
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,400
You little bastard.

2116
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,380
They're dead, they're dead.

2117
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:23,700
Okay.

2118
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:25,580
Wasn't it by the elevator?

2119
01:07:29,050 --> 01:07:29,570
Oh my gosh.

2120
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:30,410
Uh, over here?

2121
01:07:30,530 --> 01:07:31,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2122
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,330
There was one.

2123
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:35,190
The very first one we found.

2124
01:07:36,130 --> 01:07:36,910
Oh yeah, here we are.

2125
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:37,590
Oh, we're back!

2126
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:38,050
Okay.

2127
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:39,770
Yeah, he double killed us.

2128
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:40,130
Yeah.

2129
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:41,090
Yeah.

2130
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:42,370
Holy moly.

2131
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,830
I left my password back there.

2132
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:46,470
It's okay, chat remembers, right?

2133
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:46,790
Chat!

2134
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:48,450
I don't know if we have to.

2135
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:49,610
Okay, I got it.

2136
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:50,890
Alright.

2137
01:07:50,890 --> 01:07:51,730
Sink, guys.

2138
01:07:52,030 --> 01:07:52,350
Sink.

2139
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:53,270
Where is the sink?

2140
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,290
Well, this is the first floor, so we have to go to the second floor.

2141
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:55,970
Yeah, we have to go back up.

2142
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:57,470
Oh, you're right.

2143
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:57,750
Okay.

2144
01:07:58,570 --> 01:07:59,870
I believe in doobies.

2145
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:00,950
Guys, not up here.

2146
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:01,410
I know.

2147
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,090
Okay, so where have you seen the save?

2148
01:08:04,370 --> 01:08:06,870
It was in this library room somewhere.

2149
01:08:07,730 --> 01:08:08,630
This is where I got the plate.

2150
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:09,570
I got this here.

2151
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:09,950
Okay.

2152
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:11,410
Oh, okay.

2153
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:14,790
So...

2154
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,130
Uh-oh, watch out, watch out for him.

2155
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:17,450
One of us.

2156
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:18,770
We have to go that way, huh?

2157
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:19,130
One of us will remember.

2158
01:08:19,410 --> 01:08:20,530
I think we have to go that way.

2159
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:22,950
Yeah, there's going over there.

2160
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:24,130
There's here.

2161
01:08:24,610 --> 01:08:25,330
Oh, dear.

2162
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:26,150
There's too much.

2163
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:26,630
There's here.

2164
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:27,270
Don't come over here.

2165
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:27,910
Don't come over here.

2166
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:30,650
Um, is he gonna come in here?

2167
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:33,070
I don't know.

2168
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:34,610
He's through the wall.

2169
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:35,730
Oh, oh, he's here.

2170
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:37,550
Oh, no.

2171
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,970
He doesn't know.

2172
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:39,870
He doesn't know.

2173
01:08:40,070 --> 01:08:40,710
He doesn't know.

2174
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:43,070
He's not gonna come over here.

2175
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:44,710
Did on the map?

2176
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,430
What does that mean?

2177
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:47,870
Oh, he's here.

2178
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:51,130
Run, Divi!

2179
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:52,550
Divi, run!

2180
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:52,850
Oh.

2181
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:55,210
Not like that.

2182
01:09:01,610 --> 01:09:03,610
Oh, Divi's trying to bring us back.

2183
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:06,350
Hello?

2184
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:09,870
Hi.

2185
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:12,370
I'm gonna keep eating my syrup.

2186
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:12,790
Oh, I don't know.

2187
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:16,170
I don't know who's alive and who's not.

2188
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:18,570
I'm so confused.

2189
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:22,670
Oh, there it is.

2190
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,030
Oh, my God.

2191
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:25,090
One of us is alive.

2192
01:09:25,550 --> 01:09:27,250
One of us is still alive.

2193
01:09:28,510 --> 01:09:29,010
Hello?

2194
01:09:29,410 --> 01:09:29,810
Hello?

2195
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:32,750
Where are you?

2196
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:39,080
I'm at the other save point.

2197
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:40,120
I'm at the other save point.

2198
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:41,820
I'll die or I'll go up there.

2199
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:42,360
How are you guys doing?

2200
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:44,540
I'm on the...

2201
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:44,860
I'm drinking water.

2202
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,420
I'm like with all the TV people.

2203
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,240
Okay, I'm gonna die.

2204
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:50,220
Okay, did you find the save?

2205
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:50,920
I'm good.

2206
01:09:51,940 --> 01:09:53,140
Yeah, I'm gonna have fun.

2207
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:54,100
I hope you guys have fun.

2208
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:54,460
Did she find it?

2209
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,500
I hear Nimi barely.

2210
01:09:59,520 --> 01:09:59,860
Should you find the save?

2211
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:02,020
Hey.

2212
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:02,520
Hey.

2213
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:02,980
Oh.

2214
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:03,420
Oh.

2215
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:05,420
Oi.

2216
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:07,180
I don't think he can see.

2217
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:07,520
I don't think he knows.

2218
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,180
Why is it...

2219
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:08,380
Wait.

2220
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,140
It shouldn't be the...

2221
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:10,440
What?

2222
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,540
How is she the main character?

2223
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:15,240
What?

2224
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:19,140
How is she doing this?

2225
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:21,540
Hello?

2226
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:22,980
Hi.

2227
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,220
Oh, oh, they're dead.

2228
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:33,280
Yay!

2229
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,540
Doobie, how did you do that?

2230
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:37,200
I don't know.

2231
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:38,940
What did he do?

2232
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,240
I have my face between his cheeks.

2233
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:44,980
Nice.

2234
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,840
Hitting alien man's ass.

2235
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,200
I didn't find any safe.

2236
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,400
What about you?

2237
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:53,500
You guys?

2238
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:54,400
Oh, I didn't find any safe.

2239
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,560
No, we were dead for a while.

2240
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,120
We've been dead for a while.

2241
01:10:56,120 --> 01:10:57,020
We were just hiding.

2242
01:10:57,260 --> 01:10:57,480
Yeah.

2243
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,500
Okay, what if somebody stays here and then...

2244
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,980
So that we can revive and then somebody goes explore like...

2245
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:02,300
Oh!

2246
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:03,620
We go.

2247
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:04,240
The library.

2248
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:07,500
Okay, how do you do the emotes again?

2249
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:08,940
I don't remember.

2250
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:09,780
Oh, it's E?

2251
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,240
G.

2252
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:10,680
Oh, it's G.

2253
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:17,140
Green women with the same brain.

2254
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:20,780
Yeah!

2255
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:20,920
Yeah!

2256
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,140
I will go...

2257
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,500
I will go look for it.

2258
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:25,740
But let me see the thing again.

2259
01:11:26,040 --> 01:11:26,400
The plate.

2260
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,140
Alright, who would be the driver of the...

2261
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,500
The driver in Phasmophobia?

2262
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:33,900
I'll sit here because my shift key sometimes doesn't work.

2263
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:35,420
One, five, one.

2264
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:36,400
You gotta get a new keyboard.

2265
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,660
One, one, two.

2266
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:39,500
Have you heard of the wooden keyboards?

2267
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,080
One, one, two.

2268
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:42,900
Yeah.

2269
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,440
One, five, one.

2270
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:45,160
I guess you will.

2271
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,560
One, one, two.

2272
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:48,680
One, five.

2273
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:50,900
One, one, two.

2274
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,020
One, five, one.

2275
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:55,740
One, six, one.

2276
01:11:55,740 --> 01:11:57,620
It's like my personal mint radio.

2277
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:01,300
I could fall asleep to that.

2278
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:02,380
Really?

2279
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,240
A lullaby, yes.

2280
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:04,740
Oh.

2281
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:11,540
A little... He won't follow us here.

2282
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:13,060
No, no.

2283
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:13,840
Okay.

2284
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:17,000
I very vaguely remember where it was.

2285
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:19,120
It was on the other far side of that room.

2286
01:12:20,620 --> 01:12:20,960
Uh-oh.

2287
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,040
Are they dying over there?

2288
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,200
Oh, that's somebody dying, yes.

2289
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:24,780
Okay, I'm gonna run for it!

2290
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:25,820
Wait.

2291
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,440
Oh, maybe we should.

2292
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:32,840
We're gonna have to get past him somehow, though.

2293
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:33,260
Yeah.

2294
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,560
Wait, Doki's still alive.

2295
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,720
Yeah, let Doki stay there and we'll go through here.

2296
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:40,980
Alright.

2297
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:41,800
Okay.

2298
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,800
Okay, I'm going.

2299
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:43,400
I'm going!

2300
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:52,800
Uh-oh.

2301
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:54,900
No, please!

2302
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,700
No, please!

2303
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,720
I want to live!

2304
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:00,700
Oh, I'm trapped?

2305
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,340
I'm trapped?

2306
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:03,380
Oh, I'm trapped.

2307
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,420
Orangeheads cannot hear.

2308
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,140
Yeah, I know.

2309
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:28,500
Yeah, I know.

2310
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,580
But I don't know what...

2311
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:32,300
Oh, come on!

2312
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,950
Oh, where am I?

2313
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:40,830
Oh, I'm back here!

2314
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:41,290
Hi.

2315
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:42,070
Hey, guys.

2316
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:43,250
Where's Nimi?

2317
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,930
Did she die?

2318
01:13:44,370 --> 01:13:44,650
Yeah.

2319
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:45,830
Okay.

2320
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:47,530
Alright.

2321
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,430
Welcome back.

2322
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:50,930
Alright.

2323
01:13:51,490 --> 01:13:52,490
Well, go again.

2324
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:52,970
Yeah.

2325
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:54,630
I somehow stopped it.

2326
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:55,550
I don't know how.

2327
01:13:56,230 --> 01:13:57,510
Wait, you stopped the password?

2328
01:13:57,710 --> 01:13:58,470
Wait, you guys know what it is?

2329
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:59,250
Not the password.

2330
01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:00,010
I...

2331
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,070
The guy, he stopped chasing after me.

2332
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,050
I don't know why.

2333
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:03,570
Oh.

2334
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:04,370
It was weird.

2335
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:06,010
Like, I hid here.

2336
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,890
And he stopped chasing me.

2337
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:08,010
Oh.

2338
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,190
Maybe it's like the...

2339
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:10,090
The...

2340
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:10,730
Distance.

2341
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:11,130
Alright.

2342
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,470
Maybe.

2343
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:12,190
I got you guys.

2344
01:14:15,190 --> 01:14:15,590
Okay.

2345
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,690
We gotta find the safe.

2346
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:18,870
Actually, are we close to the safe?

2347
01:14:19,290 --> 01:14:20,150
I don't know.

2348
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:23,270
Oh, wait.

2349
01:14:23,270 --> 01:14:24,730
This is a nice hiding spot, too.

2350
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:25,750
Look at that.

2351
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:26,110
Oh, yeah.

2352
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:28,210
Data...

2353
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:28,490
Oh.

2354
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,670
How do we even see the map?

2355
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:31,190
I feel...

2356
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:37,440
There must definitely be a moon here.

2357
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:39,940
Oh, this is where we're at.

2358
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:40,420
Okay, okay.

2359
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:44,440
Okay.

2360
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:47,660
Oh, my God.

2361
01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:01,740
Is it time?

2362
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,560
I don't think so.

2363
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,160
I've tried that before.

2364
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:04,640
I remember.

2365
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:06,240
Probably didn't go past this door.

2366
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:08,520
Ah.

2367
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,560
I haven't seen it.

2368
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,720
But Min says she has.

2369
01:15:11,220 --> 01:15:11,660
So...

2370
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:12,380
It was green!

2371
01:15:12,620 --> 01:15:13,020
I saw!

2372
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:13,820
It was green!

2373
01:15:14,380 --> 01:15:15,680
Do you guys know what I'm talking about?

2374
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,640
It was right at the spot where it said...

2375
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:19,060
Min says she saw it.

2376
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,380
So it's like somewhere here.

2377
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,960
Unless we're at the wrong house.

2378
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,000
Guys, is it here?

2379
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,380
Is the safe even here, guys?

2380
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:29,660
Or are we going the wrong way this entire time?

2381
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:33,820
Holy cow!

2382
01:15:33,980 --> 01:15:34,900
I swear to God.

2383
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:38,440
We've been like going the wrong way the entire time.

2384
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:38,760
I...

2385
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,740
I don't know anymore.

2386
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,180
Oh, it is here.

2387
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:42,500
Okay.

2388
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:43,660
At least we know it's here.

2389
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:45,580
Closer to the left path.

2390
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,000
Okay, okay.

2391
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,300
We're all relying on Min's memory right now.

2392
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,760
Where the safe is.

2393
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:52,440
So...

2394
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,640
I did see it though!

2395
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:57,080
She is the only one out of all of us that has seen it.

2396
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,100
So I hope...

2397
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,280
I hope it's right.

2398
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,100
It was definitely in that maze area.

2399
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:01,300
Guys!

2400
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,120
Oh, I found it!

2401
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:02,740
What is it?

2402
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:03,340
What is it?

2403
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,640
What's the number?

2404
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,240
One...

2405
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,200
Five...

2406
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,040
I found it!

2407
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:10,840
I said take a screenshot!

2408
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,240
One...

2409
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,020
There's no eight!

2410
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,740
There's no eight.

2411
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:16,800
Okay.

2412
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:17,600
Five...

2413
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,520
One...

2414
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:19,020
Two...

2415
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:20,000
One...

2416
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:22,920
Five...

2417
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:23,220
Five...

2418
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:26,620
One, one, two... My chat's good.

2419
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,320
You guys are so good and helpful.

2420
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,620
Teacher of the song.

2421
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,940
Someone take the screenshot!

2422
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:35,320
Oh, everybody else is dead.

2423
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:39,480
One, one, two, one, five, one.

2424
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:46,980
One, two... One, five, one, one, five, one, five, one, five, one, five, one.

2425
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:48,800
Donkeybird, please, one, five, one.

2426
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,240
Oh my God, streamer, listen to me.

2427
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:52,760
Streamer, please!

2428
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,580
Streamer, please, listen to my voice!

2429
01:16:56,100 --> 01:16:58,600
One, two, five.

2430
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:00,220
What was that?

2431
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:01,540
You hear that?

2432
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:03,100
I hear Nimi too.

2433
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:12,340
One, five, one, five, five, five, one, two, one, two, one.

2434
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,900
Wait, is that the... It is the...

2435
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:19,500
No, it's the... I don't know how to get out though.

2436
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,260
She better live.

2437
01:17:22,420 --> 01:17:23,820
Oh my God.

2438
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,860
Wait, that guy just phased out of existence.

2439
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,680
Oh my God, I'm fucking trapped.

2440
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:32,840
Donkeybird, live.

2441
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,020
Live.

2442
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:36,140
I'm quoting Naomi Hunter.

2443
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,640
You must live.

2444
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:45,200
Doobie?

2445
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:45,760
Nope.

2446
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:46,620
Doobie?

2447
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:47,080
Nope.

2448
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:50,280
Doobie, Doobie, Doobie, Doobie.

2449
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,340
What are you?

2450
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,560
Please, revive us!

2451
01:17:53,900 --> 01:17:53,940
Doobie?

2452
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:54,920
Oh my God, Doki, please.

2453
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:56,060
Go, go save.

2454
01:17:56,220 --> 01:17:56,560
Please.

2455
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:59,300
Oh my God, what are you doing?

2456
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,100
What happened?

2457
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,480
What did you do?

2458
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,880
What happened?

2459
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,160
Good job!

2460
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:08,500
I told you I saw it.

2461
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:09,200
I told you.

2462
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:13,900
Alright, nobody... You should have learned my song.

2463
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:14,320
Five.

2464
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,240
One, one, two.

2465
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:18,340
One, five, one.

2466
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,180
One, one, two.

2467
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,980
The chat was just boobs and boobies.

2468
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:32,760
It only like, one or two people had the right code, but my chat kept spamming boob, so I couldn't get it.

2469
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,560
So what does this go to?

2470
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,340
Um, it's on the outside, remember the...

2471
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:37,760
Yeah.

2472
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:38,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2473
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:39,640
Alright.

2474
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,420
Just one more electrical board.

2475
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:42,540
Yeah, we just need one.

2476
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:43,880
But how do we get downstairs?

2477
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:46,580
Uh...

2478
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:50,200
Oh, and the other one must be in the other safe box.

2479
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,040
By the map.

2480
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:52,440
Oh!

2481
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,320
Oh, watch out, this is where the worm is?

2482
01:18:58,420 --> 01:18:59,760
You guys, there's the...

2483
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,500
Do we have to go this way?

2484
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:01,920
Yeah, why are we going this way?

2485
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:02,740
Yeah, I don't know.

2486
01:19:02,940 --> 01:19:04,860
Why did we choose the path of the most resistance?

2487
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,260
I'm just exploring, I don't know.

2488
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,020
Um...

2489
01:19:09,020 --> 01:19:11,920
I heard death right behind me!

2490
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:12,500
Who?

2491
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:14,780
Who died?

2492
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:15,480
Nobody!

2493
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:15,960
Oh!

2494
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:16,800
Yes, they did.

2495
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:18,260
Nobody!

2496
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,040
Well, it wasn't saving!

2497
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,160
Somebody!

2498
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:22,220
Somebody!

2499
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:26,260
Wait, I remember we unlocked the door that went downstairs.

2500
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:27,600
Did we?

2501
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,500
No, we didn't...

2502
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,920
We didn't blow it up, did we?

2503
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,420
No, we did, we did.

2504
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,600
We unlocked the area, see?

2505
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:33,240
Oh, okay.

2506
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:33,980
Oh, just kidding.

2507
01:19:34,260 --> 01:19:34,620
You're right.

2508
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:34,660
What?

2509
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,640
You know the way.

2510
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,620
I'm so lost in this game, damn.

2511
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:40,220
It's here.

2512
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:41,720
This is where the thing was.

2513
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,980
The moon is barely right below us.

2514
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:45,640
Yeah!

2515
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:46,200
The moon!

2516
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:46,940
Free the moon!

2517
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:47,520
Free the moon!

2518
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:48,440
Free the moon!

2519
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:49,080
Oh!

2520
01:19:49,160 --> 01:19:50,340
It's one last task!

2521
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:52,560
We have one last thing to do!

2522
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,740
Do we want to try and get the secret way to the basement?

2523
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,140
Nah, that's not that important, right?

2524
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:00,720
Oh, sorry.

2525
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:01,640
He's helping the guy.

2526
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:02,740
Yeah.

2527
01:20:03,020 --> 01:20:03,120
Yeah.

2528
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:03,800
Okay.

2529
01:20:03,940 --> 01:20:05,200
What has he ever done for us?

2530
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:06,000
So true!

2531
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:08,220
Yeah, I know.

2532
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:10,840
We gave him a TV and then he left, right?

2533
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:11,560
Yeah, yeah.

2534
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:13,360
And he was like, see ya, suckers.

2535
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,860
Maybe we're supposed to follow him.

2536
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:15,840
Like, where did he go?

2537
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:16,760
Did he just float off?

2538
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,240
He said there's like a secret way to the basement outside, but whatever.

2539
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,100
Yeah, we don't need to know that.

2540
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:22,580
Nah.

2541
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,300
So where do we find the password for the safe box?

2542
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:26,620
Northwest of the grounds.

2543
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:29,180
Does anyone know their cardinal directions?

2544
01:20:30,620 --> 01:20:31,220
Uh...

2545
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,320
Never eat soggy waffles.

2546
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:34,360
Oh, the map!

2547
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,200
Never eat soggy waffles.

2548
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:39,740
Oh wait, if we get the scanner...

2549
01:20:39,740 --> 01:20:41,420
Maybe the scanner has a...

2550
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:43,020
Oh, that's true.

2551
01:20:43,540 --> 01:20:45,080
What's the blue thing on the map?

2552
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,200
Wait, you can pull up the map?

2553
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,500
Yeah, press tab.

2554
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:52,240
Wait, I totally tried that last time too though.

2555
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:52,720
Oh my god!

2556
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:52,880
What?

2557
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:53,980
What's the manager?

2558
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:57,360
What's the map this entire time?

2559
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:58,100
Squat!

2560
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,060
Wait, what is the button?

2561
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,040
Tab!

2562
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:02,860
Tab!

2563
01:21:03,140 --> 01:21:03,180
Tab?

2564
01:21:03,180 --> 01:21:05,320
Why didn't you tell us this?

2565
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:06,540
I just...

2566
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,480
I thought...

2567
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,220
I tried it last time and it didn't work.

2568
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,000
Oh...

2569
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,060
Why is there a pin on the map?

2570
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:15,380
Yeah, that's what I'm looking at.

2571
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,240
The little blue pin.

2572
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,100
That's the next...

2573
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:18,540
That's the next...

2574
01:21:18,540 --> 01:21:19,120
Uh...

2575
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:19,800
Safe box?

2576
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:20,440
Yeah.

2577
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:20,940
It's right here.

2578
01:21:21,100 --> 01:21:21,880
We can go check it out.

2579
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:24,920
Alright.

2580
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:25,940
Like, it's right here.

2581
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:26,360
No?

2582
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:28,200
Wait, I can't believe we had...

2583
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:29,000
Maybe it's inside?

2584
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:30,360
Yeah, what is this?

2585
01:21:30,580 --> 01:21:31,280
The secret way to the basement?

2586
01:21:31,340 --> 01:21:32,060
Oh my god!

2587
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,620
It's the secret way to the basement!

2588
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:34,640
Oh, this is...

2589
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:35,300
We did it!

2590
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,340
We figured it out!

2591
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:37,480
Yeah!

2592
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:38,660
Oh...

2593
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,540
It was just marked on the map.

2594
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:41,240
Oh...

2595
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:41,560
Oh...

2596
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:41,660
What?

2597
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:43,340
I couldn't see.

2598
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:43,980
I was scared.

2599
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:47,440
Wait, I don't wanna be first.

2600
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:47,960
I'm scared.

2601
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,500
What if the...

2602
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,200
Okay, but...

2603
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,720
Is either first or behind...

2604
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:52,580
Or the last?

2605
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:55,100
Wait, where's the TV head?

2606
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:56,920
Where are...

2607
01:21:56,920 --> 01:21:58,920
Every time Doobie said it looks safe...

2608
01:21:58,920 --> 01:22:00,360
The guy can go, so...

2609
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:01,240
I found...

2610
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,320
A door?

2611
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:04,480
What is this?

2612
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,040
It's dark up ahead.

2613
01:22:06,140 --> 01:22:06,920
Better bring a light.

2614
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,400
Oh.

2615
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:10,900
Okay, so...

2616
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:12,340
We have to go forward for the TV head.

2617
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:13,000
It's...

2618
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,140
Yeah, I think it's in here.

2619
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:14,820
There's a guy over there!

2620
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:15,660
Oh, there it is?

2621
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:16,260
Okay.

2622
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,280
Yeah, he's right there.

2623
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,040
But he can only get...

2624
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,020
Oh, he walked away, see?

2625
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:19,860
He walked away.

2626
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:21,760
Oh wait, there's...

2627
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:22,200
He's over here too.

2628
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:23,580
Who is this way?

2629
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:24,740
Did someone bring a light?

2630
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:26,120
No.

2631
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:28,060
We gotta go get one.

2632
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:29,680
And then...

2633
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,260
Maybe...

2634
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,840
It was over here.

2635
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,580
Wait, I hear breathing.

2636
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,120
Me too.

2637
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:35,140
I hear breathing.

2638
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:36,980
What?

2639
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:37,860
I see.

2640
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:40,860
Yeah, the one's breathing.

2641
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,160
Yeah, the one's breathing.

2642
01:22:43,980 --> 01:22:45,760
Oh, it's the meow meows.

2643
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:48,020
Oh wait, oh shoot.

2644
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,560
Why is he in here?

2645
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:53,800
Um...

2646
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:56,020
Sorry, I brought him over here.

2647
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,440
Oh my god, he's so loud.

2648
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:01,780
The meow meows.

2649
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,060
The meow meows.

2650
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:02,360
Uh...

2651
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,460
You look so ominous over there.

2652
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:03,940
Yeah, but he...

2653
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:05,240
Those are easy to avoid.

2654
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:06,080
Oh.

2655
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:08,920
Is Doki dead?

2656
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,100
No!

2657
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,680
That last time I saw.

2658
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,000
Is there just one?

2659
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:14,560
Yeah.

2660
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:15,300
Oh.

2661
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:19,980
I saw like a half down, I think.

2662
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:21,620
Hello!

2663
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,540
Wait, we found another save terminal.

2664
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,120
I think it's the same one.

2665
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:30,360
I think it's the same one.

2666
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,380
No, I don't think so.

2667
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:32,680
Wait.

2668
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:33,320
Oh?

2669
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:34,140
Oh.

2670
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:35,920
Oh, way down here?

2671
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,400
Oh, we should have brought a light.

2672
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,500
Maybe we can't see it.

2673
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:38,960
I just...

2674
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:40,960
I guess they did say to bring the light.

2675
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,460
What's that sound?

2676
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:45,200
Hello?

2677
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:46,320
Hello?

2678
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:47,400
Oh, he's straight there.

2679
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:47,760
Oh!

2680
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:48,400
Let's go.

2681
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:50,880
Oh, I found this man.

2682
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,000
I talked to him.

2683
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:53,120
It says talk to...

2684
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,160
Oh, follow TV head!

2685
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:54,820
We gotta follow him.

2686
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:55,300
Wait, where do you go?

2687
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,000
I can't see anything.

2688
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:56,520
Where do you go?

2689
01:23:56,780 --> 01:23:57,160
Oh, God.

2690
01:23:57,340 --> 01:23:58,140
Wait, we lost him.

2691
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:58,380
Oh, no!

2692
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:58,860
He's in here!

2693
01:23:58,900 --> 01:23:58,980
Here!

2694
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:00,780
This way!

2695
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,040
This way!

2696
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:01,280
This way!

2697
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:07,250
I'm following him real close.

2698
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:07,990
I'm following him.

2699
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:08,690
I know.

2700
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:09,430
Look at him go.

2701
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:10,430
I know.

2702
01:24:10,850 --> 01:24:11,490
Little alien.

2703
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:13,310
Just a little guy.

2704
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:15,010
What did he want to go to?

2705
01:24:15,590 --> 01:24:15,910
Where are we?

2706
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:17,090
Maybe he'll find the password.

2707
01:24:19,290 --> 01:24:19,610
5...

2708
01:24:19,610 --> 01:24:20,430
1...

2709
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:20,910
1...

2710
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:21,690
2...

2711
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:23,370
1...

2712
01:24:23,370 --> 01:24:23,810
5...

2713
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:24,670
1...

2714
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,830
I swear to God.

2715
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:31,850
If the monster is like, literally right behind us while we're...

2716
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:34,330
He's right behind me.

2717
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,350
He's right behind me.

2718
01:24:36,350 --> 01:24:37,870
Oh wait, he led us to an elevator.

2719
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,790
Oh.

2720
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:40,010
Oh.

2721
01:24:40,130 --> 01:24:41,070
Is Doobie alive?

2722
01:24:41,470 --> 01:24:42,950
I don't think so.

2723
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:44,590
Hey, hey.

2724
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:46,230
We're almost at the laboratory.

2725
01:24:46,890 --> 01:24:47,210
Okay.

2726
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,370
Alright.

2727
01:24:49,230 --> 01:24:51,290
Oh, that's the secret entrance to the laboratory.

2728
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:51,670
Okay.

2729
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:54,450
This is the most convoluted entrance to the laboratory.

2730
01:24:58,230 --> 01:25:00,890
Are we gonna perform surgery on this thing?

2731
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,550
When does he turn orange?

2732
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:04,530
Wait.

2733
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:05,750
This is...

2734
01:25:05,750 --> 01:25:07,490
This room does not feel safe.

2735
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:09,270
What was that?

2736
01:25:10,070 --> 01:25:11,170
Is he gonna kill us?

2737
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:12,410
Is he the final boss?

2738
01:25:13,110 --> 01:25:13,790
I don't...

2739
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:14,930
I don't trust him.

2740
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:17,770
Look at him.

2741
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:18,410
He's just...

2742
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:19,830
smiling at us.

2743
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:21,710
Is there COVID in here?

2744
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:23,270
No?

2745
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:24,370
There's a safe station!

2746
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:25,750
Oh, nice, nice.

2747
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:27,910
Oh, do we just follow him first?

2748
01:25:28,150 --> 01:25:28,570
I think so.

2749
01:25:28,710 --> 01:25:29,750
Yeah, just follow him for now.

2750
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:31,630
Wait, there's a giant ass button.

2751
01:25:31,630 --> 01:25:31,750
What happened?

2752
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:35,570
Just...

2753
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:36,410
Talk to him.

2754
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:37,150
Okay, let's stay...

2755
01:25:37,150 --> 01:25:38,050
Let's get to be here.

2756
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:38,750
Hold on, hold on.

2757
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:39,190
Oh, sorry.

2758
01:25:39,370 --> 01:25:40,390
Oh, sorry, sorry.

2759
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:44,730
Oh, he wants the orange down there.

2760
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:46,570
Wait, you're gonna turn into a COVID head!

2761
01:25:46,890 --> 01:25:47,490
Don't do it!

2762
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,190
Don't do it!

2763
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:49,250
Okay, wait, wait, let's...

2764
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,470
Let's get to be here first.

2765
01:25:50,970 --> 01:25:51,110
Guys.

2766
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,090
Alright.

2767
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,310
Hi!

2768
01:25:54,810 --> 01:25:55,470
Welcome back!

2769
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:56,350
Alright, who's good at...

2770
01:25:56,350 --> 01:25:57,110
Thank you.

2771
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:00,250
He's gonna turn into a COVID head!

2772
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,510
What is this?

2773
01:26:04,810 --> 01:26:05,830
I pressed it.

2774
01:26:06,210 --> 01:26:07,390
You're playing a video game now.

2775
01:26:07,390 --> 01:26:07,930
Where is the grabber?

2776
01:26:07,990 --> 01:26:08,950
Oh, it's a game pad.

2777
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,450
Yeah.

2778
01:26:09,650 --> 01:26:10,570
Oh, I see it!

2779
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,050
Over there!

2780
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:12,250
Over there, you gotta move it.

2781
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:12,470
Oh, okay.

2782
01:26:12,790 --> 01:26:13,470
Who's good at...

2783
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:14,490
Who's good at this?

2784
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:15,150
Not me.

2785
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:16,750
I didn't even know who's moving.

2786
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,070
I flub it every time.

2787
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:18,730
Keep going left.

2788
01:26:18,730 --> 01:26:19,670
Keep going left.

2789
01:26:19,970 --> 01:26:20,530
Keep going left.

2790
01:26:21,130 --> 01:26:21,570
Left.

2791
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:22,610
You're...

2792
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:23,190
You're good.

2793
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:26,470
You're good, you're good, you're good.

2794
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:26,550
You're good.

2795
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:27,410
You're good.

2796
01:26:28,110 --> 01:26:29,010
Tell me, you want to stop.

2797
01:26:29,290 --> 01:26:30,030
You're good.

2798
01:26:30,610 --> 01:26:31,310
You're good.

2799
01:26:31,510 --> 01:26:31,870
Stop!

2800
01:26:32,330 --> 01:26:32,550
Stop!

2801
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,010
Oh!

2802
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:39,070
Just a little bit over to the left more.

2803
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:39,610
Oh.

2804
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:39,630
Go back, go back.

2805
01:26:40,030 --> 01:26:40,290
Back, yeah.

2806
01:26:40,830 --> 01:26:40,990
Okay.

2807
01:26:42,610 --> 01:26:42,750
Yeah.

2808
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:44,810
Stop.

2809
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:44,910
Stop.

2810
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,610
I didn't stop.

2811
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,110
Oh, I have to press it again.

2812
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:50,470
Okay.

2813
01:26:50,830 --> 01:26:51,430
I'm gonna stop.

2814
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:51,910
Stop.

2815
01:26:52,930 --> 01:26:54,090
To the left a little.

2816
01:26:54,330 --> 01:26:55,610
A little bit more, I think.

2817
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:57,150
Try now.

2818
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:57,950
Drop?

2819
01:26:58,150 --> 01:26:58,310
Alright.

2820
01:26:59,970 --> 01:27:00,930
Oh, so close.

2821
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:02,870
Come on.

2822
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:04,890
A little more to the left.

2823
01:27:06,510 --> 01:27:07,990
And then... A little back?

2824
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:09,330
Yeah, a little... Oh wait.

2825
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:10,530
Yeah, a little back.

2826
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:10,970
What?

2827
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:11,790
Okay.

2828
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:11,950
Okay.

2829
01:27:13,490 --> 01:27:14,990
And a little more to the left.

2830
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:15,730
Right?

2831
01:27:16,850 --> 01:27:17,090
Right?

2832
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:17,290
Right?

2833
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:18,370
Left?

2834
01:27:18,570 --> 01:27:18,850
Left?

2835
01:27:20,730 --> 01:27:21,250
Guys!

2836
01:27:21,970 --> 01:27:22,490
Left?

2837
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:22,910
Left?

2838
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:23,270
Left?

2839
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:23,810
Left?

2840
01:27:23,890 --> 01:27:23,890
Left?

2841
01:27:23,950 --> 01:27:23,950
Left?

2842
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:24,110
Left?

2843
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:24,810
Left?

2844
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:28,630
Oh my god.

2845
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:29,310
Is it even open?

2846
01:27:29,310 --> 01:27:30,050
A little tiny bit right.

2847
01:27:30,550 --> 01:27:32,350
Okay guys, first off, is it open?

2848
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:33,910
I don't know.

2849
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,430
Yeah!

2850
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:36,970
Left!

2851
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:37,970
Left!

2852
01:27:38,350 --> 01:27:38,410
Left!

2853
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:38,950
Okay.

2854
01:27:39,890 --> 01:27:40,210
Okay.

2855
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:41,510
Left!

2856
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:42,130
Left!

2857
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,150
And... More left!

2858
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:44,810
More left!

2859
01:27:45,010 --> 01:27:45,430
More back!

2860
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:46,610
More left, more back!

2861
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:47,610
Okay.

2862
01:27:48,350 --> 01:27:48,910
Okay.

2863
01:27:49,890 --> 01:27:50,950
Is this good?

2864
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:51,450
Yeah.

2865
01:27:51,670 --> 01:27:52,430
Yeah, send it!

2866
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:55,910
A little more back!

2867
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:55,970
A little more back!

2868
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,250
How precise is this?

2869
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:57,830
A little more back!

2870
01:27:58,890 --> 01:27:59,250
There.

2871
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:00,730
Drop it.

2872
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:02,450
Drop it like it's high.

2873
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:03,430
What?

2874
01:28:03,530 --> 01:28:03,690
Okay.

2875
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:04,430
Are you serious?

2876
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:07,830
I don't think this is... this is gonna happen.

2877
01:28:08,650 --> 01:28:11,090
Guys, I swear to god, if this was not open in...

2878
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:12,230
Wait, what?

2879
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,350
How do we do that?

2880
01:28:16,270 --> 01:28:17,070
It's rigged.

2881
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:18,690
Like your red crane game.

2882
01:28:19,090 --> 01:28:20,070
Oh wait, left?

2883
01:28:21,490 --> 01:28:21,890
Left?

2884
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:23,910
Left?

2885
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:23,970
Stop?

2886
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:25,790
Where's our perspective?

2887
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,450
Is there a...

2888
01:28:26,450 --> 01:28:27,570
Stop, just press it.

2889
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,750
You press it again to stop it.

2890
01:28:28,830 --> 01:28:28,950
Yeah.

2891
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:30,470
Yeah.

2892
01:28:30,470 --> 01:28:30,850
Did I get it?

2893
01:28:31,030 --> 01:28:31,430
Oh!

2894
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,390
It was our perspective!

2895
01:28:34,390 --> 01:28:34,710
Thank you!

2896
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:36,610
I just got lucky.

2897
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:37,570
I couldn't see it.

2898
01:28:37,710 --> 01:28:38,050
Ah!

2899
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:41,030
Oh, and then we did pull it back to him.

2900
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:41,410
Us.

2901
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:42,210
Yeah.

2902
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,250
Yeah.

2903
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,110
Oh yeah, put it on and put it on.

2904
01:28:45,210 --> 01:28:45,950
Wait, he's gonna die!

2905
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:46,770
Wait, I'm gonna use...

2906
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:48,510
I'm gonna use the vacuum.

2907
01:28:48,650 --> 01:28:49,330
Someone else do it.

2908
01:28:49,330 --> 01:28:49,970
I'll be right back.

2909
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:51,490
Okay.

2910
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:54,990
Wait, you're gonna die, Doki.

2911
01:28:55,230 --> 01:28:55,630
You're right here.

2912
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:57,110
Wait, it's gonna touch you!

2913
01:28:57,810 --> 01:28:59,510
Doki, why did you stop right there?

2914
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:01,370
Just let her die.

2915
01:29:01,850 --> 01:29:02,490
Yeah, well...

2916
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:02,750
Yeah.

2917
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:03,830
Wait, is it...

2918
01:29:03,830 --> 01:29:03,970
Okay.

2919
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:06,650
That's as far as it goes.

2920
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:08,110
Yeah, it's as far as it goes.

2921
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:10,110
Maybe talk to him and then he's like, oh...

2922
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:10,890
Wait, I can grab it.

2923
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:12,270
Oh!

2924
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:13,170
Okay.

2925
01:29:13,850 --> 01:29:15,670
I don't think this is gonna be good.

2926
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:16,570
Talk to him.

2927
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:19,770
This is a good orange.

2928
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:21,350
Just what we need.

2929
01:29:22,110 --> 01:29:24,550
We'll be able to install it in the operating room.

2930
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:25,930
We are performing surgery!

2931
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,150
Doki will follow us.

2932
01:29:32,150 --> 01:29:32,370
Hello.

2933
01:29:33,150 --> 01:29:34,030
We'll come pick her up.

2934
01:29:34,030 --> 01:29:34,510
I'll come back.

2935
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:35,870
Yeah, we'll pick her up.

2936
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:36,550
We'll pick her up.

2937
01:29:38,010 --> 01:29:39,570
There's an operating room?

2938
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,610
It's a lab, so it can't be fun.

2939
01:29:44,090 --> 01:29:45,610
Is this part of the...

2940
01:29:45,610 --> 01:29:46,510
What we have to do?

2941
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,210
I wonder.

2942
01:29:48,430 --> 01:29:51,290
Because would they really program a side quest into this game?

2943
01:29:51,510 --> 01:29:52,070
That's true.

2944
01:29:52,290 --> 01:29:52,710
That's true.

2945
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,810
It also was on the map.

2946
01:29:55,070 --> 01:29:56,150
Like the secret, you know?

2947
01:29:56,350 --> 01:29:56,670
What's this?

2948
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:56,850
Yeah.

2949
01:29:58,550 --> 01:29:59,070
Oh.

2950
01:29:59,070 --> 01:29:59,530
I'll wait for...

2951
01:29:59,530 --> 01:30:00,170
I'll wait for Doki.

2952
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:01,690
But there's something here, too.

2953
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:04,030
Good lord.

2954
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:09,590
After the head replacement procedure, it is imperative to immediately initiate a full memory wipe of the subject.

2955
01:30:10,010 --> 01:30:10,290
Oh.

2956
01:30:10,670 --> 01:30:10,850
Oh.

2957
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:16,310
Even brief retention of previous neural links can lead to undesirable side effects.

2958
01:30:16,570 --> 01:30:21,870
Patients who have undergone the operation exhibit a radical shift in spatial orientation.

2959
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:26,730
Their perception of gravity becomes inverted, which may trigger escape attempts.

2960
01:30:26,990 --> 01:30:28,250
Errors at this stage are unacceptable.

2961
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:28,530
Oh.

2962
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:30,070
That's why they're on the ceiling.

2963
01:30:30,150 --> 01:30:31,170
That's why they walk on the ceiling.

2964
01:30:31,350 --> 01:30:31,590
Yeah.

2965
01:30:33,830 --> 01:30:36,550
And this guy wants to be an orange because?

2966
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:36,830
Why?

2967
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:39,610
Maybe because all his friends are orange.

2968
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:40,710
I guess so.

2969
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:41,310
Yeah.

2970
01:30:41,650 --> 01:30:42,450
He feels a little...

2971
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:44,610
He's got no color in his world.

2972
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:45,330
I believe.

2973
01:30:45,790 --> 01:30:46,270
Oh, hey.

2974
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:46,890
Hi.

2975
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:49,190
You guys are just carrying the head just like that.

2976
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,950
It's time to replace the head.

2977
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:52,230
I'm about to perform surgery.

2978
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,370
We're gonna do a surgery on the alien.

2979
01:30:54,890 --> 01:30:55,070
Yeah.

2980
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,110
It's like the...

2981
01:30:56,110 --> 01:30:57,670
It's like the Mei Mei say.

2982
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:58,630
Okay.

2983
01:30:58,750 --> 01:30:59,230
Here I go.

2984
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:00,270
Eh?

2985
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,190
First, you need to remove the TV.

2986
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:05,110
Then, you put the orange in its place.

2987
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:06,310
Why does he want this?

2988
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:11,810
I'm ready to be a TV head with no TV.

2989
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,110
Let's hope it all goes right.

2990
01:31:16,170 --> 01:31:16,610
Oh.

2991
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:17,910
It's gonna be built different.

2992
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:19,110
It's not gonna be like the other one.

2993
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:19,410
It's pretty.

2994
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:21,470
Oh my god, he's T-posing.

2995
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:22,410
He's...

2996
01:31:22,930 --> 01:31:23,910
He's T-posing.

2997
01:31:24,210 --> 01:31:24,990
I'm taking...

2998
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:25,610
Wait, I can't...

2999
01:31:25,610 --> 01:31:26,570
Can someone else take the head?

3000
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:27,130
Or...

3001
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:27,630
Yeah, take it.

3002
01:31:27,770 --> 01:31:28,130
Yeah, there you go.

3003
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:28,510
Oh.

3004
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,450
I took it.

3005
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:31,350
I'm applying the item.

3006
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:33,050
What?

3007
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:38,910
Oh my god, that's how you think...

3008
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,470
Wait, I think he'll be...

3009
01:31:40,470 --> 01:31:41,670
Isn't he evil now?

3010
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,390
Yes.

3011
01:31:43,070 --> 01:31:43,390
Maybe?

3012
01:31:43,910 --> 01:31:44,230
Maybe?

3013
01:31:44,230 --> 01:31:45,210
No, he seems cool.

3014
01:31:45,310 --> 01:31:46,110
Yeah, he's cool now.

3015
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:47,430
Another orange head.

3016
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:48,610
Oh, he's...

3017
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:49,710
He won't talk to me.

3018
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:50,950
Oh?

3019
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:52,730
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

3020
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:53,330
Dot, dot, dot.

3021
01:31:53,330 --> 01:31:53,570
Dot, dot?

3022
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,950
Maybe we need to bring him something.

3023
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:56,010
Oh, he's talking to me.

3024
01:31:56,130 --> 01:31:56,510
What the hell?

3025
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:56,770
What?

3026
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:57,710
Oh, he didn't like you.

3027
01:31:58,290 --> 01:31:58,630
He didn't like you.

3028
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:00,190
I think I've got an orange for a head now.

3029
01:32:00,410 --> 01:32:00,570
Yay.

3030
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:01,290
Yay.

3031
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,990
For some reason I feel drawn upward.

3032
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:06,490
That's unusual.

3033
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:08,270
Yeah, that's weird.

3034
01:32:08,290 --> 01:32:09,730
Maybe somebody else has to talk to him now.

3035
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:10,170
Yeah.

3036
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,730
Oh, okay.

3037
01:32:11,130 --> 01:32:11,750
Your turn, Mimi.

3038
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:13,090
Okay.

3039
01:32:13,710 --> 01:32:15,110
I think I might be able to try something.

3040
01:32:15,470 --> 01:32:17,290
I'll be in the courtyard of the main building.

3041
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:18,070
Oh!

3042
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:18,950
Where's the courtyard?

3043
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:20,330
Wait, guys, remember this...

3044
01:32:20,330 --> 01:32:21,090
The other dead...

3045
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:21,730
Dead alien?

3046
01:32:22,650 --> 01:32:22,990
Yeah.

3047
01:32:23,470 --> 01:32:23,990
Oh, yeah.

3048
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:24,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3049
01:32:25,310 --> 01:32:25,750
Oh!

3050
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:28,170
Maybe he'll tell us the codes.

3051
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:30,170
Oh.

3052
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:30,390
Oh.

3053
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:30,870
Oh.

3054
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:33,890
I don't think we can open that.

3055
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:34,670
Heck no.

3056
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:35,730
We gotta find the...

3057
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,010
So, we gotta go to the courtyard.

3058
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:38,410
And then...

3059
01:32:38,410 --> 01:32:39,550
Also, we gotta give the...

3060
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,150
The other dead alien this other TV.

3061
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:41,610
Yeah.

3062
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,450
I feel like that was so far away.

3063
01:32:43,950 --> 01:32:44,390
Okay, yeah.

3064
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:45,130
How did we get down?

3065
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:46,610
The guide led us here.

3066
01:32:46,710 --> 01:32:47,390
How do we get back?

3067
01:32:47,990 --> 01:32:48,490
I don't know.

3068
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,590
We don't have a flashlight.

3069
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:57,280
I don't know.

3070
01:32:57,420 --> 01:32:58,540
We could save real quick, too.

3071
01:32:58,980 --> 01:32:59,420
Maybe?

3072
01:32:59,820 --> 01:33:00,540
Okay, we save.

3073
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:00,960
We save.

3074
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:02,160
Yeah.

3075
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:03,340
We never went this way.

3076
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:04,520
Maybe this way...

3077
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:04,600
Wait, we have a map.

3078
01:33:04,860 --> 01:33:05,500
We have a map.

3079
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,040
No map.

3080
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:06,780
No map.

3081
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:07,040
No map.

3082
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:09,800
We have a flashlight.

3083
01:33:10,420 --> 01:33:10,940
Oh, wait.

3084
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:11,560
We have a...

3085
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,480
The flashlight.

3086
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:13,360
Oh my gosh.

3087
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:13,980
There's a basement.

3088
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,780
Oh, isn't this where we die if we walk?

3089
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,220
Yeah, yeah.

3090
01:33:18,300 --> 01:33:21,600
And then from there, we can take the elevator to go to the first floor.

3091
01:33:22,460 --> 01:33:22,760
How do we...

3092
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:23,540
Wait, is there nothing here?

3093
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:24,480
Oh...

3094
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:24,880
This way.

3095
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:26,020
Can we take this?

3096
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:26,320
Oh.

3097
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:26,980
No?

3098
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,800
Why is it so...

3099
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,280
There's nothing here.

3100
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:28,780
Yeah.

3101
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:29,220
Oh, there's...

3102
01:33:29,220 --> 01:33:29,340
Oh.

3103
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:31,940
How mysterious.

3104
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,440
Oh, it is...

3105
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:35,260
Oh.

3106
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:36,480
We're here.

3107
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,400
Oh, this is so handy.

3108
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:39,480
Oh, there's a...

3109
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:39,640
Yeah.

3110
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:41,200
There's a little goo guy, so let's...

3111
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:41,640
Let's go.

3112
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:42,160
Yeah.

3113
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:43,380
We don't look at them.

3114
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:44,880
He can't get in the elevator, right?

3115
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,400
No.

3116
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,200
No.

3117
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:48,160
No one can get in the elevator.

3118
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,000
No.

3119
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:52,500
None of the aliens can get in.

3120
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:52,820
No.

3121
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:53,700
They're not loud.

3122
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:55,020
Was it the...

3123
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:55,780
It was the...

3124
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,820
Third floor?

3125
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,580
Third floor.

3126
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:58,120
Third floor.

3127
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:00,420
Yeah, we're in the first floor right now.

3128
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:01,000
Okay.

3129
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:05,200
We're doing it, guys.

3130
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:06,100
We just need...

3131
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,700
I wanna watch Cartoon Network.

3132
01:34:09,200 --> 01:34:10,080
No, I'm a...

3133
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:11,580
I'm a Nickelodeon kid.

3134
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,900
Dexter's lab is on.

3135
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:13,480
Come on.

3136
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:13,680
Yeah.

3137
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:14,860
We're here.

3138
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:16,620
Wait, what are we doing here?

3139
01:34:16,660 --> 01:34:17,440
Oh, the other elevator.

3140
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:17,840
Yeah.

3141
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:20,240
Alright.

3142
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,880
We're almost there.

3143
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:25,900
What are we doing?

3144
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:27,200
Uh...

3145
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,160
Wait, what do we do first?

3146
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:29,520
The TV or the courtyard?

3147
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:31,520
Um...

3148
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,740
What's closer?

3149
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:34,100
Whichever.

3150
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:35,540
I think...

3151
01:34:35,540 --> 01:34:36,880
I think the TV's closer, right?

3152
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:40,600
Well, I mean, we have to go to the courtyard first, to be fair, but...

3153
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:40,840
Yeah.

3154
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:42,180
Maybe a TV?

3155
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:43,140
Just in case.

3156
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,680
The TV would be a little more dangerous.

3157
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,840
Is it the first floor or the basement?

3158
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:53,420
Basement?

3159
01:34:57,520 --> 01:34:58,320
I don't...

3160
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,900
It'll come back to us when we see.

3161
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:00,740
Wait, we have a map.

3162
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:01,960
Why are we asking each other this?

3163
01:35:01,960 --> 01:35:03,600
There's no map data.

3164
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:04,500
Check it.

3165
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:05,440
Oh...

3166
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:07,160
I think it's only for outside.

3167
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,780
Oh, and someone said first floor.

3168
01:35:09,820 --> 01:35:10,240
Let's go do that.

3169
01:35:10,260 --> 01:35:11,420
There's just one guy.

3170
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,020
Um, excuse...

3171
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,860
It's two guys.

3172
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:14,760
Um...

3173
01:35:14,760 --> 01:35:16,760
One is a member, and one isn't.

3174
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:17,560
Oh...

3175
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:18,600
Okay.

3176
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:20,420
Oh, it's here!

3177
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:21,260
Oh!

3178
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:22,720
Oh?

3179
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:23,300
Where are we?

3180
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,140
And then we go to the second floor.

3181
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,000
Wait, no, see?

3182
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:27,840
Oh, he's here.

3183
01:35:28,160 --> 01:35:29,040
Oh, here's the courtyard.

3184
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:29,820
There he is!

3185
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,780
Yeah, there he is!

3186
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:31,120
He's...

3187
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:32,320
He's waiting for us.

3188
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,380
He's upside down.

3189
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,920
Is he just gonna float away if he walks out of the stairwell?

3190
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:38,760
I know!

3191
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,000
What happens to him?

3192
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:40,960
Yeah.

3193
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:41,420
Wait, he's...

3194
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:42,740
He's sitting up there.

3195
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,320
He's so cute!

3196
01:35:44,080 --> 01:35:44,420
Aww.

3197
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:45,980
Hi!

3198
01:35:46,180 --> 01:35:46,340
Hey!

3199
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:48,740
I think I'll be better there.

3200
01:35:49,200 --> 01:35:50,520
Feels like I could jump.

3201
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:51,360
Really?

3202
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,580
What's stopping me?

3203
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,500
Just the thought of how long I'll keep falling.

3204
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:56,520
That scares me a bit.

3205
01:35:56,680 --> 01:35:57,060
Aww.

3206
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:57,220
Aww.

3207
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:58,520
Aww.

3208
01:35:59,200 --> 01:35:59,900
I'll keep going again.

3209
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:00,400
Oh, yeah.

3210
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:01,140
Oh.

3211
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:02,000
Thank you.

3212
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:03,820
I couldn't have done any of this without you.

3213
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,620
It's time for me to go.

3214
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:06,080
No!

3215
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:06,880
No!

3216
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:10,600
Oh, no!

3217
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:11,160
Wait!

3218
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:11,900
Wait!

3219
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,080
Did we do the right thing?

3220
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:27,700
07 in the chat.

3221
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:33,580
Wait, it says visit the operating room in the laboratory again.

3222
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,240
Okay, do we do the...

3223
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:37,340
I guess we should go to the operating room, right?

3224
01:36:37,340 --> 01:36:37,420
Okay.

3225
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:38,900
That's where we just were.

3226
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:40,160
Yeah.

3227
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:40,820
I think so.

3228
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,440
I think we should do the TV guy first though.

3229
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:44,360
I see...

3230
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:44,700
Okay.

3231
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,400
I think this progresses the story.

3232
01:36:46,700 --> 01:36:48,640
And I think the other one was like a bonus side quest.

3233
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,700
Yeah, I think so too.

3234
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:50,540
That's fair.

3235
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,280
Yeah, so we should do the side quest for just to see.

3236
01:36:53,500 --> 01:36:55,580
Cause I think it's a reward for competing it.

3237
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:56,500
I got it.

3238
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:56,920
Okay.

3239
01:36:57,220 --> 01:36:57,880
Yeah, me too.

3240
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,060
Me too.

3241
01:37:00,300 --> 01:37:02,280
It was like that song.

3242
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:02,700
What was that?

3243
01:37:02,820 --> 01:37:04,660
Do do do do do do do do do do.

3244
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:05,740
Do do do do do.

3245
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:07,760
Oh, yeah.

3246
01:37:07,760 --> 01:37:07,780
Oh, yeah.

3247
01:37:11,360 --> 01:37:11,760
Wait.

3248
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:13,500
How do we get to the elevator because it's...

3249
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:13,800
Here, here.

3250
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:14,600
Okay.

3251
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,640
Yeah, and then...

3252
01:37:17,640 --> 01:37:18,220
Laboratory.

3253
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,500
Yeah, we're doing it, guys.

3254
01:37:22,740 --> 01:37:23,440
Got it.

3255
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,440
His final message was for us to go to the operating room.

3256
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:29,540
Yeah, but why?

3257
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:30,780
Maybe there's like a tracker on him.

3258
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:31,680
Yeah, maybe.

3259
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:37,160
Do you think he... Do you think he's still floating in space right now?

3260
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:38,440
Yeah.

3261
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,320
I thought he was gonna go to the moon.

3262
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:39,940
He's probably not there yet.

3263
01:37:39,980 --> 01:37:40,980
He's going to the moon.

3264
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,440
Another moon.

3265
01:37:43,540 --> 01:37:44,260
Another moon.

3266
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,600
Wait, why are we following Min?

3267
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,500
Because the elevator's right here.

3268
01:37:50,180 --> 01:37:51,060
That's stupid.

3269
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:55,000
I don't remember what floor was that.

3270
01:37:55,060 --> 01:37:56,320
Oh, it wasn't the first floor?

3271
01:37:56,420 --> 01:37:56,720
Yeah.

3272
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:56,900
Yeah.

3273
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:00,960
The first floor?

3274
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:02,720
Yeah.

3275
01:38:03,180 --> 01:38:05,160
Oh my god, am I holding the TV while doing this?

3276
01:38:05,420 --> 01:38:06,460
Yeah, you are.

3277
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,020
Whoa.

3278
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:08,380
Whoa.

3279
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:13,340
And then over here to the... Pretty gnarly, guys.

3280
01:38:14,180 --> 01:38:14,700
Gnarly.

3281
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,400
Everything's gnarly.

3282
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:19,800
Yeah.

3283
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:22,140
Oh, this way?

3284
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:23,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3285
01:38:23,860 --> 01:38:24,220
I remember.

3286
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,480
And then there's the operating table.

3287
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:27,000
Yeah, yeah.

3288
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:27,660
All the way down here.

3289
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,860
But what do we have to do here again, I wonder?

3290
01:38:32,580 --> 01:38:33,060
I don't know.

3291
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:35,360
I think he just gave us something.

3292
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:35,820
Yeah, yeah.

3293
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:35,980
See?

3294
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,200
What is it?

3295
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:37,980
Final message.

3296
01:38:38,740 --> 01:38:39,200
Oh!

3297
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:41,100
Change the world.

3298
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:42,480
What's it say?

3299
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:44,320
Place the... Oh!

3300
01:38:44,440 --> 01:38:46,520
Place the crystal inside to upgrade it.

3301
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,160
The upgrade crystal is capable of destroying the oranges.

3302
01:38:49,980 --> 01:38:50,000
Oh!

3303
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:50,900
Oh!

3304
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:51,620
That would be huge!

3305
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:52,780
That would be huge!

3306
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:54,740
That would be huge.

3307
01:38:54,740 --> 01:38:55,680
Look on the other side.

3308
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:58,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3309
01:38:58,600 --> 01:38:59,400
All the way over here.

3310
01:38:59,700 --> 01:38:59,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3311
01:38:59,780 --> 01:38:59,780
All the way over here.

3312
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:01,780
It's like, only one of you guys have to do that.

3313
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:03,300
Yeah!

3314
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:04,840
Yeah!

3315
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:05,660
Crystal!

3316
01:39:07,340 --> 01:39:08,340
Could be huge.

3317
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,100
Could be huge.

3318
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:11,980
Wait.

3319
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:12,500
This?

3320
01:39:13,220 --> 01:39:14,080
I think so.

3321
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:15,080
Yeah.

3322
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:16,100
It said crystal.

3323
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:17,540
Yeah, yeah.

3324
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:18,220
That's it, I think.

3325
01:39:21,890 --> 01:39:22,330
Okay.

3326
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:22,690
Woohoo!

3327
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:27,170
Kinda messed up killing all his friends though, isn't it?

3328
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:27,570
Oh!

3329
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:28,810
What if he dies up there?

3330
01:39:29,490 --> 01:39:29,710
Yeah!

3331
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:30,090
Oh, yeah!

3332
01:39:30,550 --> 01:39:31,770
It's okay, he's in space.

3333
01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:32,970
Wait, so where do I put it?

3334
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,650
In the box, right?

3335
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:36,770
Place the crystal inside to upgrade it.

3336
01:39:37,030 --> 01:39:37,570
Yeah, yeah.

3337
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:38,310
This box.

3338
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:38,770
Oh.

3339
01:39:39,450 --> 01:39:39,610
Wait.

3340
01:39:39,870 --> 01:39:39,930
Oh.

3341
01:39:40,050 --> 01:39:40,550
Did I upgrade?

3342
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:41,610
I don't think that's the right...

3343
01:39:44,870 --> 01:39:45,350
Oh!

3344
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,970
Oh!

3345
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:47,410
Whoa!

3346
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:51,150
It does, me too!

3347
01:39:52,330 --> 01:39:53,130
It's upgraded.

3348
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:53,130
It's upgraded.

3349
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:54,390
Yay!

3350
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:58,830
Also, we got, like, a special little thing to... because of...

3351
01:39:58,830 --> 01:39:59,510
I take it!

3352
01:39:59,990 --> 01:40:00,370
Yeah!

3353
01:40:01,090 --> 01:40:01,450
All right.

3354
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:03,230
Let's go find a TD.

3355
01:40:04,850 --> 01:40:05,950
Are they dead then?

3356
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:06,510
Let's see.

3357
01:40:06,730 --> 01:40:07,550
They were down here.

3358
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:08,110
Oh.

3359
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:09,130
I can't.

3360
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:12,270
But we have to take... we have to, like, go up towards them, right?

3361
01:40:12,270 --> 01:40:13,210
Yeah, I guess so.

3362
01:40:13,950 --> 01:40:14,450
Yeah, yeah.

3363
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:15,370
It's, like, AOE.

3364
01:40:15,610 --> 01:40:15,810
Oh!

3365
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:16,490
Oh, okay, okay.

3366
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:16,650
Oh, wait.

3367
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:17,550
Wait, wait, wait, just save.

3368
01:40:18,610 --> 01:40:19,570
Oh, save, save, save.

3369
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:20,950
I'm coming, I'm coming!

3370
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,310
Yay!

3371
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:23,630
Okay.

3372
01:40:23,870 --> 01:40:24,170
Okay.

3373
01:40:24,270 --> 01:40:26,810
So now we can go do the last password easily.

3374
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:30,510
Yeah, we'll be able to walk through that, like, whole area.

3375
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:31,570
Yeah.

3376
01:40:31,730 --> 01:40:31,730
Yeah.

3377
01:40:32,010 --> 01:40:33,630
Where is the password, though?

3378
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:35,410
I don't know.

3379
01:40:37,230 --> 01:40:37,910
We'll figure it out.

3380
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:39,190
No, we have a map now.

3381
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:39,790
We have a map.

3382
01:40:40,010 --> 01:40:40,150
Oh, yeah.

3383
01:40:40,710 --> 01:40:41,030
True.

3384
01:40:41,030 --> 01:40:41,250
True!

3385
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:44,330
Alright.

3386
01:40:45,410 --> 01:40:46,070
Alright.

3387
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:48,170
We got this.

3388
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:49,150
The Super Cheeto.

3389
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:49,670
Everything's coming together.

3390
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:52,110
I believe.

3391
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:58,550
Alright.

3392
01:40:59,070 --> 01:40:59,990
Got my TV.

3393
01:41:00,510 --> 01:41:01,570
We got our Cheeto.

3394
01:41:01,870 --> 01:41:03,070
We're ready to get him.

3395
01:41:03,690 --> 01:41:04,350
We're gaming?

3396
01:41:04,490 --> 01:41:04,850
Yeah.

3397
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,350
I'm ready for our lap party, guys.

3398
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:13,410
Let's go!

3399
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:13,430
Let's go!

3400
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,910
That's a good question.

3401
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:15,550
Is the crystal upgrade permanent?

3402
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:16,670
Or do we have to do it every time?

3403
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:19,250
Well, we're not gonna lose it, so we don't have to worry about it.

3404
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:19,410
Yeah.

3405
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:19,750
Yeah.

3406
01:41:19,790 --> 01:41:20,670
Was it first floor?

3407
01:41:20,830 --> 01:41:21,150
Exactly.

3408
01:41:22,210 --> 01:41:23,210
Oh, yeah, it's first floor.

3409
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:26,090
Whoa!

3410
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:29,750
Okay.

3411
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:32,390
The TV head guy is on the second floor.

3412
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:33,210
So we got...

3413
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:33,390
Whoa!

3414
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:37,050
Go, guys.

3415
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:37,690
Woo!

3416
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:40,410
Okay.

3417
01:41:40,610 --> 01:41:42,090
Does anyone know how to get to the second floor?

3418
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:45,290
Um, we got...

3419
01:41:45,290 --> 01:41:47,110
Maybe we could go from the court...

3420
01:41:47,110 --> 01:41:48,190
We're from the annex, right?

3421
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:51,170
Uh...

3422
01:41:51,170 --> 01:41:52,150
Oh, here, here, here!

3423
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:52,330
Yeah.

3424
01:41:52,930 --> 01:41:53,470
Found it.

3425
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:54,050
Oh!

3426
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:55,670
Easy peasy.

3427
01:41:56,590 --> 01:41:57,510
Uh, TV head.

3428
01:41:58,430 --> 01:41:59,570
Oh, we're gonna go kill them?

3429
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:00,730
No, no, no.

3430
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:01,110
The...

3431
01:42:01,110 --> 01:42:02,630
We're gonna give him the last alien the TV.

3432
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:03,850
Yeah, let's give the last...

3433
01:42:03,850 --> 01:42:05,470
The other alien the TV first, I think.

3434
01:42:05,790 --> 01:42:06,130
Okay.

3435
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:07,370
Yeah, yeah.

3436
01:42:09,090 --> 01:42:10,070
I don't remember where he was.

3437
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:11,650
I remember the first guy was here, but...

3438
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:13,110
Yeah, he's all the way up down here.

3439
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:13,330
He was a close spy.

3440
01:42:13,690 --> 01:42:14,090
He's right here.

3441
01:42:14,190 --> 01:42:14,570
He's right here.

3442
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:16,310
Oh, okay.

3443
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:17,590
Hello, TV man.

3444
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:18,650
Take the TV.

3445
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:20,310
Hello.

3446
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:21,690
Do you want an orb, too?

3447
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:22,690
You want...

3448
01:42:23,630 --> 01:42:24,710
Oh, he's happier.

3449
01:42:25,630 --> 01:42:25,890
Yeah.

3450
01:42:27,050 --> 01:42:27,250
Oh.

3451
01:42:27,410 --> 01:42:27,690
Hello?

3452
01:42:27,950 --> 01:42:28,270
Uh, hello?

3453
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:30,190
You kind of remind me of something.

3454
01:42:31,070 --> 01:42:32,470
Did you even know...

3455
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:33,630
Creatures like you...

3456
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:36,150
Pissed off the little black liquid creatures?

3457
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:39,150
They got all bothered and now...

3458
01:42:39,150 --> 01:42:40,170
Well, this is happening.

3459
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:41,430
Yeah, what, me?

3460
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:43,970
Yeah, you.

3461
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:44,890
And, uh...

3462
01:42:44,890 --> 01:42:46,790
You sort of plugged the TV into me.

3463
01:42:47,810 --> 01:42:50,830
Now I can't even look away from all this weirdness.

3464
01:42:51,050 --> 01:42:51,330
Oh my...

3465
01:42:51,330 --> 01:42:52,330
He's not grateful at all.

3466
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:54,870
He didn't help...

3467
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:56,250
Why did he go?

3468
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:57,010
Oh!

3469
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,090
Look what you did!

3470
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:01,170
You didn't ask for his consent.

3471
01:43:01,490 --> 01:43:02,750
To have a TV on his head.

3472
01:43:02,770 --> 01:43:04,310
You are the one holding the TV!

3473
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:05,350
No.

3474
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:05,590
No.

3475
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:06,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

3476
01:43:06,930 --> 01:43:08,650
Wait, we should go save over here real quick.

3477
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:08,830
Like...

3478
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:10,130
Oh yeah, let's see this.

3479
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:11,710
He's so...

3480
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:12,110
Oh, there's a guy!

3481
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:12,590
There's a guy!

3482
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:12,710
There's a guy!

3483
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:13,710
I hear him.

3484
01:43:13,910 --> 01:43:14,210
I hear him.

3485
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:15,210
Wait, what kind of guy?

3486
01:43:15,530 --> 01:43:15,970
It's the...

3487
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:17,010
It's the Slenderman.

3488
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:18,110
Yeah.

3489
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:20,270
The one that...

3490
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:22,010
Boys gets us.

3491
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:22,890
Okay, now...

3492
01:43:22,890 --> 01:43:23,430
Look at the map.

3493
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:25,470
Yeah, maybe the map will tell us.

3494
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:26,390
Maybe we go to courtyard?

3495
01:43:26,910 --> 01:43:27,570
Will tell us?

3496
01:43:28,230 --> 01:43:28,550
Okay.

3497
01:43:29,310 --> 01:43:30,210
What do you mean the courtyard?

3498
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:31,690
Why would the courtyard tell us?

3499
01:43:31,710 --> 01:43:32,590
Because we have to get out of the building.

3500
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:33,350
Of the ground.

3501
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:35,770
It says the ground, so I assume it's outside.

3502
01:43:35,770 --> 01:43:37,510
Oh, northwest of the ground.

3503
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:38,390
Oh, there's the...

3504
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:39,690
The other guy is over there.

3505
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:40,390
Wait, how do we...

3506
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,910
I know that the...

3507
01:43:40,910 --> 01:43:43,410
There's the safety box is where the map was.

3508
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:45,730
But I don't know where the password is.

3509
01:43:46,010 --> 01:43:46,450
Northwest.

3510
01:43:47,030 --> 01:43:49,490
Yeah, because we need to find the password for it.

3511
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,770
It says northwest of the ground, so...

3512
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:53,870
Maybe the...

3513
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:54,390
Okay, guys.

3514
01:43:54,590 --> 01:43:56,130
You know our cardinal directions now, right?

3515
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:56,890
Yeah.

3516
01:43:57,530 --> 01:43:59,650
Okay, so there's a staircase here.

3517
01:44:00,690 --> 01:44:01,130
East.

3518
01:44:03,890 --> 01:44:05,190
Alright, let's go downstairs.

3519
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:07,190
There's like...

3520
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:09,830
Yeah...

3521
01:44:09,830 --> 01:44:10,290
And then...

3522
01:44:10,290 --> 01:44:10,930
Is there a...

3523
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:11,830
Slendermarm?

3524
01:44:12,030 --> 01:44:12,530
I'm at Matt now.

3525
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:14,750
Where's Northwest?

3526
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:16,330
Oh, I'm on somebody's set.

3527
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,330
Oh, that's where that building is, where that, uh...

3528
01:44:18,750 --> 01:44:19,350
Face guy?

3529
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:22,810
Yeah, yeah, where the face guy is bothering us.

3530
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:24,090
Oh...

3531
01:44:24,090 --> 01:44:25,250
And we know what to do.

3532
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:26,810
Oh, where do we find the password?

3533
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:28,170
Oh, he's like right there.

3534
01:44:28,590 --> 01:44:28,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3535
01:44:29,090 --> 01:44:30,810
He goes through the gate, so be careful.

3536
01:44:31,190 --> 01:44:31,630
Oh, he does?

3537
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:34,250
We'll wait for him to go back the other way.

3538
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:34,810
Okay, there he goes.

3539
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:37,030
There he goes.

3540
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:37,870
Look at him go.

3541
01:44:38,090 --> 01:44:40,450
We're looking for a password, okay.

3542
01:44:40,650 --> 01:44:42,610
Yeah, it says Northwest of the ground.

3543
01:44:44,590 --> 01:44:46,050
Around here, does it mean?

3544
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:47,650
What's that thing?

3545
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,030
I think so.

3546
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:52,230
Did you just say, what is Northwest?

3547
01:44:53,450 --> 01:44:55,930
I mean, where is Northwest?

3548
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:57,170
Uh-oh.

3549
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:58,170
He's coming, he's coming.

3550
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:00,330
Oh my god, guys, we gotta split up.

3551
01:45:00,970 --> 01:45:02,190
I think he's on me.

3552
01:45:02,470 --> 01:45:04,990
If I die, feed my cats.

3553
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:13,480
Stupid.

3554
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,480
Hold on, I'm taking a sippy of water real quick.

3555
01:45:24,180 --> 01:45:24,820
Oh shit.

3556
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,900
Oh, no sippy of water.

3557
01:45:27,020 --> 01:45:27,640
No sippy of water.

3558
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:28,480
No sippy of water.

3559
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:29,780
Oh my god.

3560
01:45:30,300 --> 01:45:31,700
Oh my god.

3561
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,180
I gotta go in there.

3562
01:45:41,620 --> 01:45:42,880
I know where they are.

3563
01:45:43,080 --> 01:45:44,200
Okay, I'm gonna try.

3564
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,200
Actually, where is he?

3565
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,240
Oh, I see him.

3566
01:45:53,850 --> 01:45:54,390
Oh shit.

3567
01:45:57,450 --> 01:45:58,610
I don't wanna die.

3568
01:45:58,830 --> 01:45:59,630
I don't wanna die.

3569
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:02,910
Password?

3570
01:46:03,130 --> 01:46:03,390
No.

3571
01:46:06,970 --> 01:46:08,270
I didn't get the password.

3572
01:46:09,330 --> 01:46:10,450
Wait, you got a special what?

3573
01:46:10,450 --> 01:46:13,870
Oh, frickin' lame reading.

3574
01:46:14,250 --> 01:46:14,590
Aww.

3575
01:46:14,990 --> 01:46:15,190
Aww.

3576
01:46:15,390 --> 01:46:15,850
Merge.

3577
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:17,430
Aww.

3578
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:18,230
I'm gonna check again.

3579
01:46:18,490 --> 01:46:19,150
Oh, I use here.

3580
01:46:19,650 --> 01:46:20,570
Oh, this one.

3581
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,210
Oh.

3582
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:25,150
It's a five.

3583
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:26,910
I know, right?

3584
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:27,630
One.

3585
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,650
One, two.

3586
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:28,750
Two?

3587
01:46:29,710 --> 01:46:30,590
One later.

3588
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:30,950
Okay.

3589
01:46:31,290 --> 01:46:31,450
Wait.

3590
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:32,450
Okay.

3591
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:34,110
One of the numbers is three.

3592
01:46:34,830 --> 01:46:35,410
How do you...

3593
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:38,380
Okay.

3594
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:39,040
Okay.

3595
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:40,160
Come over here, guys.

3596
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:41,620
I'll show you what I know.

3597
01:46:42,100 --> 01:46:43,160
What do you know?

3598
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,320
What do you know?

3599
01:46:46,320 --> 01:46:46,400
Oh.

3600
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,070
I'm still alive.

3601
01:47:19,950 --> 01:47:21,190
One of them was three.

3602
01:47:21,330 --> 01:47:22,410
I don't know what...

3603
01:47:23,130 --> 01:47:23,730
How did you...

3604
01:47:23,730 --> 01:47:25,790
I didn't see how you saw what the number was, though.

3605
01:47:26,370 --> 01:47:30,490
If you go up to that tree, and then you look down, and there's a number three on it.

3606
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:31,030
What?

3607
01:47:31,630 --> 01:47:33,410
Do you think it's the five trees?

3608
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:34,190
No.

3609
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:36,550
Oh, it's this.

3610
01:47:37,070 --> 01:47:38,070
Oh, there are five.

3611
01:47:38,230 --> 01:47:39,790
These are the three numbers.

3612
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:41,950
Oh, my God.

3613
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:42,270
Oh, my God.

3614
01:47:42,690 --> 01:47:43,130
Okay.

3615
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:44,150
So, the three...

3616
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:46,390
The three is...

3617
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:46,750
Okay.

3618
01:47:46,930 --> 01:47:47,010
Wait.

3619
01:47:47,150 --> 01:47:48,650
It says one...

3620
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:49,470
Okay.

3621
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:50,450
Number two is three.

3622
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:50,830
Okay.

3623
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:51,870
Number two is three.

3624
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:52,910
Okay.

3625
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:53,850
Oh, my God.

3626
01:47:53,990 --> 01:47:54,950
This is hellish.

3627
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:56,350
Okay.

3628
01:47:57,750 --> 01:47:58,190
Alright.

3629
01:47:58,490 --> 01:47:58,630
Okay.

3630
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:00,130
I'm gonna go look for number one.

3631
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:00,750
I see.

3632
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:01,250
Okay.

3633
01:48:01,490 --> 01:48:03,710
Oh, no.

3634
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:08,440
Does he turn around?

3635
01:48:08,680 --> 01:48:09,180
Yes, he does.

3636
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:09,500
Okay.

3637
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,120
He's turned around.

3638
01:48:10,220 --> 01:48:10,380
Alright.

3639
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:11,480
What's yours?

3640
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:12,120
What's yours?

3641
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,180
What trees?

3642
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:18,260
Just follow your heart, Nimi.

3643
01:48:18,620 --> 01:48:19,940
Just follow your heart.

3644
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:20,060
Just follow your heart.

3645
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:21,280
Wait, is there...

3646
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:22,060
Which way is...

3647
01:48:22,060 --> 01:48:23,160
Wait, I see.

3648
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:26,240
We all have to stick together to go to our area anyway.

3649
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:27,620
And then we'll have to get up.

3650
01:48:27,740 --> 01:48:28,680
Is it like over here?

3651
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:30,160
No, no, no.

3652
01:48:30,220 --> 01:48:30,880
It's on the other side.

3653
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:32,040
It's on the other side of the gate.

3654
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:33,220
It is?

3655
01:48:34,060 --> 01:48:34,740
Number one?

3656
01:48:35,660 --> 01:48:36,480
Is it over here?

3657
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:37,120
Oh, sorry.

3658
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:37,880
Oh, sorry.

3659
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:38,380
Sorry.

3660
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:38,840
Sorry.

3661
01:48:39,640 --> 01:48:42,080
My big butt can't get through the door.

3662
01:48:52,990 --> 01:48:55,190
I hate the way these things breathe, man.

3663
01:48:55,290 --> 01:48:56,030
They're so scary.

3664
01:48:59,010 --> 01:49:00,410
I'm kinda confused, though.

3665
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:04,310
Like, what is all this foliage, you know?

3666
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:15,100
Like, it looks like it should be in there, no?

3667
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,460
Just use my map.

3668
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,400
Oh, look at that!

3669
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,620
I can see them alive!

3670
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:31,960
That's crazy!

3671
01:49:38,120 --> 01:49:39,320
Please don't kill me.

3672
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:43,940
I don't think it's outside.

3673
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:46,600
I really can't tell.

3674
01:49:46,780 --> 01:49:47,800
I'm trying my best.

3675
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,900
Maybe it is.

3676
01:50:07,790 --> 01:50:08,310
One!

3677
01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:09,150
I'm stupid!

3678
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:10,910
We're in the trees!

3679
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:12,210
Okay!

3680
01:50:12,590 --> 01:50:13,810
You guys saw the number, right?

3681
01:50:13,890 --> 01:50:15,010
You guys saw my number, right?

3682
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:15,890
What?

3683
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:19,000
You're crazy, right?

3684
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,260
No, I didn't see it.

3685
01:50:21,660 --> 01:50:22,180
Okay!

3686
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:23,360
Alright, come and follow me!

3687
01:50:23,660 --> 01:50:24,460
We're all gonna see you.

3688
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:25,040
Okay.

3689
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:28,180
Maybe one person can only see one number on each tree.

3690
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:30,660
Do you see this number?

3691
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:31,140
Oh!

3692
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:34,020
I thought you meant the glowing tree.

3693
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:34,600
Oh!

3694
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:35,100
Three!

3695
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:37,020
There's a three!

3696
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:40,960
Okay, let's check all the normal trees in this area then.

3697
01:50:41,900 --> 01:50:43,080
Is that two or...

3698
01:50:43,640 --> 01:50:45,540
That's number two, yeah, that's two.

3699
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:46,000
That's number two?

3700
01:50:46,160 --> 01:50:46,420
Yeah.

3701
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:48,300
Okay.

3702
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:49,780
So, straight...

3703
01:50:49,780 --> 01:50:51,220
Whatever direction.

3704
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:52,120
This way...

3705
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:54,540
I was trying to find number one, but I couldn't find it.

3706
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:55,100
Why?

3707
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:56,900
It has to be the other side!

3708
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:57,880
You think so?

3709
01:50:58,340 --> 01:50:59,340
Yeah, right?

3710
01:50:59,540 --> 01:51:02,440
No, I think it can't be because it would be too easy.

3711
01:51:05,860 --> 01:51:07,300
Where would it be then?

3712
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:08,000
I don't know.

3713
01:51:08,140 --> 01:51:09,140
I was looking over here.

3714
01:51:09,820 --> 01:51:11,300
I don't see any other number.

3715
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:17,280
It's been here.

3716
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:19,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

3717
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:24,180
Nine!

3718
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:24,940
Or six!

3719
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:26,280
Six or nine, right here.

3720
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:26,480
Oh, oh!

3721
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:27,920
Um, I think it's six.

3722
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:28,580
I think it's six.

3723
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:29,200
I think it's six.

3724
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:29,580
I can't tell.

3725
01:51:29,860 --> 01:51:30,700
Wait, you might be right.

3726
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:30,960
I can't tell.

3727
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,340
I think I got ambushed by somebody's body.

3728
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,440
Was it on the map?

3729
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:43,980
It was me.

3730
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:44,680
I'm sorry.

3731
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:45,840
It's okay.

3732
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:47,320
I thought the map was the cars.

3733
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:49,180
I ambushed you.

3734
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:50,100
Car battery stuff.

3735
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,480
You were hiding in the bush.

3736
01:51:51,620 --> 01:51:52,720
You were like...

3737
01:51:53,180 --> 01:51:54,020
It was true.

3738
01:51:54,180 --> 01:51:55,040
Guerilla warfare.

3739
01:51:58,000 --> 01:51:59,140
I think they stood up.

3740
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:02,740
Yippee!

3741
01:52:03,420 --> 01:52:04,900
I got another number.

3742
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:07,220
Oh, which one?

3743
01:52:07,660 --> 01:52:09,400
It's either six or nine.

3744
01:52:09,860 --> 01:52:10,740
The one over here.

3745
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:11,180
Okay.

3746
01:52:11,180 --> 01:52:12,360
There should be another three.

3747
01:52:13,120 --> 01:52:13,960
Oh, nice!

3748
01:52:14,780 --> 01:52:15,920
Revive us, please!

3749
01:52:16,540 --> 01:52:17,360
Revive us!

3750
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:18,980
Okay.

3751
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,660
Thank you!

3752
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:20,340
Okay.

3753
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,340
Let's see.

3754
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:24,100
Which one was yours, though?

3755
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:25,480
Was it the one or the three?

3756
01:52:26,080 --> 01:52:27,800
Oh, it's either six or nine.

3757
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:28,340
We don't know.

3758
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:29,520
Mine was one.

3759
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:30,360
Mine was...

3760
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:30,800
It's six?

3761
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:31,200
Okay.

3762
01:52:31,220 --> 01:52:31,380
One.

3763
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:33,900
Okay, so...

3764
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:35,520
Then three is like up ahead.

3765
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:36,200
And...

3766
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:36,300
Okay.

3767
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:37,420
I pulled up my map.

3768
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,600
Three is close to one.

3769
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:41,680
And five is also...

3770
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:43,420
They're in that kind of square little area.

3771
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:43,720
Yeah.

3772
01:52:43,900 --> 01:52:46,360
If someone can lead the guy away, then...

3773
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:47,260
I'll do it!

3774
01:52:47,440 --> 01:52:47,820
You will?

3775
01:52:48,160 --> 01:52:49,140
I believe in him!

3776
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:49,660
The hero!

3777
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:50,500
The hero!

3778
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,160
Wait, where is he?

3779
01:52:52,620 --> 01:52:54,340
Oh, he's over where we need to go.

3780
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:54,820
Just kidding.

3781
01:52:55,400 --> 01:52:55,760
Okay.

3782
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:04,220
Okay.

3783
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:04,940
All right.

3784
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:06,260
There should be one...

3785
01:53:06,260 --> 01:53:07,940
So, this is the one that I just found.

3786
01:53:08,220 --> 01:53:08,700
This is the one you found.

3787
01:53:08,700 --> 01:53:08,980
Yeah.

3788
01:53:09,080 --> 01:53:11,180
There should be one maybe around over here.

3789
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:12,520
Or...

3790
01:53:12,900 --> 01:53:13,740
Mr. Eyeball.

3791
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:14,660
There's five!

3792
01:53:14,980 --> 01:53:15,740
You found five?

3793
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,460
Yeah, it's right here.

3794
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:18,460
Oh, I see it!

3795
01:53:18,540 --> 01:53:19,020
So, that's...

3796
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:19,180
Okay.

3797
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:19,860
Five.

3798
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:20,560
I'll go put it in.

3799
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:21,120
I'll go put it in.

3800
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:21,740
Okay.

3801
01:53:21,740 --> 01:53:22,020
That way.

3802
01:53:22,820 --> 01:53:23,300
Okay.

3803
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:24,320
Because...

3804
01:53:24,320 --> 01:53:24,700
I'll remember.

3805
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:25,620
Five.

3806
01:53:25,900 --> 01:53:26,080
Five.

3807
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:26,520
Five.

3808
01:53:26,760 --> 01:53:26,960
Five.

3809
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:32,310
Okay.

3810
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:33,770
So, that was...

3811
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:35,110
Number...

3812
01:53:35,110 --> 01:53:36,190
Three is five.

3813
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:38,710
Okay.

3814
01:53:38,890 --> 01:53:40,370
So, you need...

3815
01:53:41,150 --> 01:53:42,210
I can't read that.

3816
01:53:42,810 --> 01:53:43,130
Four...

3817
01:53:43,130 --> 01:53:43,250
Okay.

3818
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:45,070
Oh!

3819
01:53:50,940 --> 01:53:52,080
Oh, everybody's alive.

3820
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:52,540
Look at that.

3821
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:53,060
That's crazy.

3822
01:53:55,740 --> 01:53:56,220
Oh!

3823
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:56,500
Hello!

3824
01:53:56,500 --> 01:53:57,300
Hi!

3825
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:57,860
Hi!

3826
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:00,220
That guy just almost got your butt.

3827
01:54:01,800 --> 01:54:02,240
Wait.

3828
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:02,940
Did people die?

3829
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:04,120
I don't think so.

3830
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:04,960
No, they're...

3831
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:05,440
Oops.

3832
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:06,500
They're on their way.

3833
01:54:06,980 --> 01:54:07,080
Oh.

3834
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:07,900
Oh, wait.

3835
01:54:08,020 --> 01:54:08,800
I'll keep distracting him.

3836
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:09,480
Oh, you guys got it.

3837
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:11,160
A six or a nine.

3838
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:12,420
At the far end.

3839
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,640
That would be the fourth digit.

3840
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:13,920
Okay.

3841
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:14,860
The fourth one?

3842
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:15,760
Uh...

3843
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:17,120
Yeah, so...

3844
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:17,740
I'll just...

3845
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:18,440
Oh!

3846
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:19,980
We did it!

3847
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:20,720
We did it!

3848
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:21,600
We did it!

3849
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:22,300
Yay!

3850
01:54:23,340 --> 01:54:24,560
We did it again!

3851
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:25,920
Get here!

3852
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,720
We can beat the game!

3853
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:27,740
We can beat the game!

3854
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:28,440
Yay!

3855
01:54:29,240 --> 01:54:29,360
Wait.

3856
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:30,140
Should we save again?

3857
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:30,980
Yeah, let's save again.

3858
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:32,000
Save again.

3859
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:32,080
Save again.

3860
01:54:32,220 --> 01:54:32,380
Save again.

3861
01:54:32,380 --> 01:54:32,600
Save again.

3862
01:54:32,680 --> 01:54:32,980
Good idea.

3863
01:54:33,300 --> 01:54:33,640
Good idea.

3864
01:54:35,580 --> 01:54:35,940
Nice.

3865
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:36,680
Okay.

3866
01:54:36,840 --> 01:54:36,980
Nice.

3867
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:37,560
Let's go.

3868
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:39,600
Let's go save the moon.

3869
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:41,300
Get rid of the moon.

3870
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:42,160
Get rid of the creatures!

3871
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:43,660
Yeah!

3872
01:54:44,360 --> 01:54:44,560
Yeah!

3873
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,280
We'll have two moons on Earth, guys.

3874
01:54:47,580 --> 01:54:47,960
Woohoo!

3875
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:49,780
Cool moons!

3876
01:54:50,160 --> 01:54:51,220
Just keep running.

3877
01:54:51,640 --> 01:54:54,380
Just don't ignore the footsteps behind you.

3878
01:54:54,540 --> 01:54:55,040
Just keep running.

3879
01:54:57,440 --> 01:54:58,280
We're good, we're good.

3880
01:54:58,640 --> 01:54:59,580
Yeah, we're fine.

3881
01:55:00,340 --> 01:55:03,340
Wait, is this the one that we have to do inside at the laboratory?

3882
01:55:03,680 --> 01:55:04,240
No, no, no.

3883
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,240
This one's outside.

3884
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:05,880
Oh, okay, okay.

3885
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:09,320
Am I holding it still?

3886
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:10,780
Yeah, yeah, you got it.

3887
01:55:11,620 --> 01:55:12,560
Oh, it's this one, that's right.

3888
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:14,420
Oh my gosh, I'm so excited!

3889
01:55:15,680 --> 01:55:16,120
Ready?

3890
01:55:16,540 --> 01:55:17,440
We did it!

3891
01:55:17,880 --> 01:55:20,460
Wait, wait, I don't know actually if this ends the game, but...

3892
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:21,180
I hope so!

3893
01:55:22,700 --> 01:55:26,000
Not that I'm not enjoying my time spent with you all.

3894
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:28,600
Yeah, I was like, we just wanna see the moon!

3895
01:55:28,780 --> 01:55:30,220
Yeah, I'm going in.

3896
01:55:31,360 --> 01:55:31,960
The moon?

3897
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,120
It won't let me.

3898
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:38,180
Open the hatches?

3899
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:39,200
Is it gonna come out?

3900
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:41,060
Wait, it's coming, it's coming out!

3901
01:55:41,320 --> 01:55:42,380
The moon is rising!

3902
01:55:43,580 --> 01:55:44,000
Oh!

3903
01:55:44,820 --> 01:55:46,060
Oh, it's getting quicker!

3904
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:46,860
Oh!

3905
01:55:47,320 --> 01:55:47,580
Oh!

3906
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:56,710
Oh!

3907
01:55:57,050 --> 01:55:57,470
Oh!

3908
01:55:57,470 --> 01:55:57,970
Oh, sorry guys.

3909
01:55:58,030 --> 01:55:58,490
Get on!

3910
01:55:58,710 --> 01:55:58,850
Yeah!

3911
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:00,070
Oh my god, you're right!

3912
01:56:01,310 --> 01:56:03,870
So are you guys seeing Jake's up or Edward, guys?

3913
01:56:04,130 --> 01:56:04,270
Right?

3914
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:06,410
Obviously.

3915
01:56:07,110 --> 01:56:07,530
Whoa!

3916
01:56:08,430 --> 01:56:09,310
Oh, look!

3917
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:10,670
It's sucking the creatures in!

3918
01:56:10,810 --> 01:56:11,810
It's sucking the creatures in!

3919
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:12,350
Oh!

3920
01:56:12,350 --> 01:56:12,410
Wait!

3921
01:56:12,850 --> 01:56:14,610
My girlfriend wants to talk to me.

3922
01:56:14,750 --> 01:56:15,410
Sorry, hold on.

3923
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:17,170
Wait, why does the moon even glow?

3924
01:56:17,230 --> 01:56:17,310
Wait, why does the moon even glow?

3925
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:19,190
Because the moon is only lit up by the sun.

3926
01:56:19,650 --> 01:56:20,630
Wait, guys, it's not over.

3927
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:23,550
Is this a moonrise?

3928
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,150
Oh, that's what she just said.

3929
01:56:25,430 --> 01:56:25,510
Wait.

3930
01:56:25,690 --> 01:56:27,010
Oh, we got everything done, didn't we?

3931
01:56:27,770 --> 01:56:28,250
It's blocked by the energy dome.

3932
01:56:28,250 --> 01:56:28,350
It's awesome.

3933
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:29,870
There's an energy dome.

3934
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:31,950
Oh my god!

3935
01:56:32,490 --> 01:56:32,510
Oh shit!

3936
01:56:32,610 --> 01:56:33,910
We were so close!

3937
01:56:33,970 --> 01:56:36,790
Wait, when it says two out of two, and one out of one.

3938
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:37,650
Yeah.

3939
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:39,930
Oh, I think it's everywhere we've been to.

3940
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:41,050
And then we just like...

3941
01:56:41,050 --> 01:56:41,930
Oh, we...

3942
01:56:41,930 --> 01:56:41,970
Okay.

3943
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:43,750
Wait, what's an energy return?

3944
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:45,150
You just press a button.

3945
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:45,550
Oh!

3946
01:56:45,550 --> 01:56:46,070
Look at the map!

3947
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:46,570
Look at the map!

3948
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:50,210
Oh, the valves!

3949
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:51,930
Oh, that's a vampire.

3950
01:56:52,710 --> 01:56:53,610
So there's one...

3951
01:56:53,610 --> 01:56:54,890
Inside here?

3952
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:55,230
Yeah.

3953
01:56:55,570 --> 01:56:56,510
But you gotta be careful.

3954
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:57,410
There is.

3955
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:58,870
Oh, so that's not too hard.

3956
01:56:58,870 --> 01:56:59,030
There is.

3957
01:57:00,710 --> 01:57:01,730
Oh, get me!

3958
01:57:02,010 --> 01:57:02,210
Get me!

3959
01:57:02,230 --> 01:57:02,550
Get me!

3960
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:02,570
Get me!

3961
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:02,910
Get me!

3962
01:57:03,330 --> 01:57:04,530
Okay, one of us has to...

3963
01:57:04,530 --> 01:57:04,990
There's a guy!

3964
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:05,390
There's a guy!

3965
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:08,150
Our wife will save us!

3966
01:57:08,150 --> 01:57:08,850
Yeah, girlfriend saved me!

3967
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:09,990
Did he save us?

3968
01:57:11,350 --> 01:57:12,310
She'll find him.

3969
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:13,430
Yeah, she will.

3970
01:57:13,570 --> 01:57:13,630
Oh.

3971
01:57:13,990 --> 01:57:14,590
Did someone die?

3972
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:16,210
I think so.

3973
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:17,490
I think I heard somebody scream.

3974
01:57:18,870 --> 01:57:20,230
Wait, shall we go to the s...

3975
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:21,510
Where's the safe point?

3976
01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:24,010
Was this one gotten then?

3977
01:57:25,530 --> 01:57:26,370
I guess so.

3978
01:57:27,250 --> 01:57:29,650
Oh wait, I can do the same point over here.

3979
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:30,530
The first one, I think.

3980
01:57:30,670 --> 01:57:31,410
Okay, cool, cool.

3981
01:57:36,190 --> 01:57:36,670
Yeah.

3982
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:37,690
Nice.

3983
01:57:39,110 --> 01:57:39,810
It was near me.

3984
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:41,590
Right here.

3985
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:43,510
Oh, we're back.

3986
01:57:43,650 --> 01:57:44,130
Welcome back.

3987
01:57:44,410 --> 01:57:45,970
Okay, I got... I...

3988
01:57:45,970 --> 01:57:47,230
Wait, there's one like right here.

3989
01:57:54,890 --> 01:57:55,370
Hello?

3990
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:55,850
Hello?

3991
01:57:58,050 --> 01:57:59,650
She's actually Blair Witching.

3992
01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:01,270
Wait, oh no.

3993
01:58:09,510 --> 01:58:11,790
I said Toki just sent my game correct.

3994
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:15,750
Wait, let me turn them up.

3995
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:16,770
Hello?

3996
01:58:17,070 --> 01:58:18,970
I hope they didn't get kicked out.

3997
01:58:19,190 --> 01:58:20,090
We got kicked out.

3998
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:21,810
Yeah, you were Blair Witching in the corner.

3999
01:58:22,570 --> 01:58:22,830
Alright.

4000
01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:25,110
This will be fast.

4001
01:58:25,670 --> 01:58:26,350
Oh, wait.

4002
01:58:27,150 --> 01:58:28,130
Yeah, it should be fun.

4003
01:58:28,450 --> 01:58:29,370
Yeah, it should be fun.

4004
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:34,250
Thank you.

4005
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:37,870
You guys can change your colors now.

4006
01:58:38,010 --> 01:58:38,930
You guys can change your colors now.

4007
01:58:38,930 --> 01:58:40,350
Guys, at least we can be your colors now.

4008
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:40,870
Hello?

4009
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:41,310
Yeah.

4010
01:58:42,970 --> 01:58:43,230
Hello?

4011
01:58:46,450 --> 01:58:47,670
One second, guys.

4012
01:58:49,950 --> 01:58:50,510
Hello?

4013
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:51,590
Oh!

4014
01:58:51,950 --> 01:58:54,330
I didn't get to change my colors!

4015
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:56,850
Wait, what happened to the numbers?

4016
01:58:57,250 --> 01:58:57,870
They changed.

4017
01:58:58,290 --> 01:58:58,870
Did they change?

4018
01:58:58,870 --> 01:59:00,130
Yeah, they did.

4019
01:59:00,190 --> 01:59:00,550
No, no.

4020
01:59:00,630 --> 01:59:01,110
It's the same.

4021
01:59:01,850 --> 01:59:02,050
For me.

4022
01:59:02,830 --> 01:59:03,290
It's...

4023
01:59:03,290 --> 01:59:03,890
1...

4024
01:59:03,890 --> 01:59:04,350
1-2.

4025
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:06,490
Oh, okay.

4026
01:59:06,490 --> 01:59:07,650
Mine was messed up then.

4027
01:59:07,770 --> 01:59:09,690
I was excited about me and my colors!

4028
01:59:11,010 --> 01:59:11,050
I...

4029
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:12,650
Yeah...

4030
01:59:14,510 --> 01:59:16,670
That's why I pressed art.

4031
01:59:17,610 --> 01:59:17,850
Ew!

4032
01:59:20,010 --> 01:59:21,030
Wait, where's that?

4033
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:21,790
There's one in a...

4034
01:59:21,790 --> 01:59:23,230
There's one, like, right here.

4035
01:59:23,370 --> 01:59:24,290
But how do we get to it?

4036
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:25,190
I think it's in one of these...

4037
01:59:26,690 --> 01:59:27,050
Wait.

4038
01:59:27,310 --> 01:59:28,130
Yeah, right there it's rolling.

4039
01:59:29,210 --> 01:59:30,430
How do we get there?

4040
01:59:30,850 --> 01:59:31,070
Yeah.

4041
01:59:31,170 --> 01:59:32,110
Just go over here, I think.

4042
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:33,110
You can just go in, right?

4043
01:59:33,150 --> 01:59:33,370
Oh!

4044
01:59:34,030 --> 01:59:34,750
You're so smart.

4045
01:59:36,150 --> 01:59:37,090
Oh, my God.

4046
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:37,750
Thanks.

4047
01:59:38,130 --> 01:59:38,690
Don't worry, guys.

4048
01:59:38,690 --> 01:59:39,410
I'll get this one.

4049
01:59:39,530 --> 01:59:40,030
You guys can get the rest.

4050
01:59:40,030 --> 01:59:41,090
Oh, the second floor and basement!

4051
01:59:41,510 --> 01:59:42,330
Second floor and basement?

4052
01:59:42,530 --> 01:59:43,670
I wish to now say two out of two.

4053
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:44,110
Oh!

4054
01:59:44,410 --> 01:59:45,210
Okay, okay, so...

4055
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:46,930
Wasn't it supposed to be like this the whole time?

4056
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:46,990
Yeah.

4057
01:59:47,270 --> 01:59:48,310
Guys, we gotta go...

4058
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,650
Go to the second floor or the basement.

4059
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,870
Okay.

4060
01:59:52,270 --> 01:59:52,890
No, it's this way.

4061
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:55,870
I believe in that...

4062
01:59:55,870 --> 01:59:55,990
Wait.

4063
01:59:56,170 --> 01:59:58,050
Why can't I see anything on my map, though?

4064
01:59:59,130 --> 02:00:00,110
That's not serious.

4065
02:00:00,310 --> 02:00:00,610
There we go.

4066
02:00:00,870 --> 02:00:02,350
Wasn't this the basement over here?

4067
02:00:02,490 --> 02:00:02,590
No.

4068
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:03,990
Yeah, where's this...

4069
02:00:03,990 --> 02:00:04,750
Where's the...

4070
02:00:04,750 --> 02:00:06,590
The door from the basement?

4071
02:00:06,770 --> 02:00:06,790
I don't know.

4072
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:07,510
Isn't it right here?

4073
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:08,650
There's stairs over here.

4074
02:00:08,650 --> 02:00:09,470
Oh, you're here.

4075
02:00:09,570 --> 02:00:10,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4076
02:00:10,210 --> 02:00:10,670
It's right here.

4077
02:00:11,150 --> 02:00:11,390
Okay.

4078
02:00:11,770 --> 02:00:13,090
We found one over here.

4079
02:00:13,670 --> 02:00:14,070
Yeah.

4080
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:16,990
Watch out, that guy.

4081
02:00:17,090 --> 02:00:17,750
Oh, hi.

4082
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:19,150
Same way.

4083
02:00:19,150 --> 02:00:19,210
Same way.

4084
02:00:19,650 --> 02:00:23,530
Guys, we never found the map data for the basement.

4085
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:24,390
Oh, no.

4086
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:24,990
Oh, no.

4087
02:00:26,310 --> 02:00:27,950
Wait, but it's like right by the...

4088
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:29,610
I remember seeing it right by the door.

4089
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:30,230
You do?

4090
02:00:30,510 --> 02:00:31,250
Oh, okay.

4091
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:31,590
Yeah.

4092
02:00:32,310 --> 02:00:32,550
Yeah.

4093
02:00:33,370 --> 02:00:34,710
Basement or basement two?

4094
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:38,750
I did basement two because you said second floor basement.

4095
02:00:40,490 --> 02:00:41,430
Oh, oh, it is.

4096
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:42,130
Second floor.

4097
02:00:42,330 --> 02:00:42,550
See?

4098
02:00:43,130 --> 02:00:43,570
Open the map.

4099
02:00:45,210 --> 02:00:46,410
This way, this way, this way.

4100
02:00:46,690 --> 02:00:47,050
Okay.

4101
02:00:47,170 --> 02:00:47,570
Be careful.

4102
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:48,430
Another side.

4103
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:51,070
Oh, we have to go past...

4104
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:52,370
Him.

4105
02:00:52,510 --> 02:00:53,330
Oh, he's right there.

4106
02:00:53,450 --> 02:00:53,850
He's right there.

4107
02:00:54,850 --> 02:00:55,350
Wait, no.

4108
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:55,930
We go forward.

4109
02:00:56,090 --> 02:00:56,570
We go forward.

4110
02:00:58,270 --> 02:00:58,630
What?

4111
02:00:58,810 --> 02:00:59,710
I said be careful.

4112
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:01,010
Why did you go forward?

4113
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:02,110
Well, Doki can get it.

4114
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:02,910
Oh.

4115
02:01:03,230 --> 02:01:04,110
He's chasing her.

4116
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:04,770
Oh.

4117
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:07,410
I see her running on the map.

4118
02:01:07,530 --> 02:01:08,030
Oh, she's got it.

4119
02:01:08,070 --> 02:01:08,490
She got it.

4120
02:01:10,010 --> 02:01:10,390
All right.

4121
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:11,150
Now she can die.

4122
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:11,850
We'll go rest.

4123
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:12,490
Yeah.

4124
02:01:12,930 --> 02:01:13,330
Um, we're...

4125
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:14,210
Just die, Doki.

4126
02:01:14,450 --> 02:01:15,030
We'll bring you back.

4127
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:17,570
Wait, where's the elevator again?

4128
02:01:17,610 --> 02:01:17,870
Right here.

4129
02:01:18,090 --> 02:01:18,510
Where it is.

4130
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:22,190
Basement.

4131
02:01:24,210 --> 02:01:25,110
I wonder if she's dead.

4132
02:01:30,270 --> 02:01:33,470
Thank you for being a hero, D.V.

4133
02:01:33,950 --> 02:01:35,510
We're both heroes.

4134
02:01:37,850 --> 02:01:39,050
Yeah, we're all heroes.

4135
02:01:39,430 --> 02:01:39,670
Yeah.

4136
02:01:40,410 --> 02:01:41,410
We've all been great.

4137
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:44,370
Guys, heroes never die, guys.

4138
02:01:44,770 --> 02:01:44,950
True.

4139
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:46,230
So now...

4140
02:01:46,750 --> 02:01:47,150
Okay, second floor.

4141
02:01:47,390 --> 02:01:48,030
Second floor.

4142
02:01:49,370 --> 02:01:50,730
Oh, it's like right here.

4143
02:01:51,110 --> 02:01:51,730
Oh, easy.

4144
02:01:52,550 --> 02:01:52,970
Yeah.

4145
02:01:57,630 --> 02:01:58,430
Oh, yeah.

4146
02:01:58,550 --> 02:01:59,470
I've left it.

4147
02:01:59,530 --> 02:02:00,010
Is that it?

4148
02:02:00,670 --> 02:02:02,010
I thought the game was...

4149
02:02:02,010 --> 02:02:02,970
And then we go to the moon.

4150
02:02:03,110 --> 02:02:03,490
Got it?

4151
02:02:03,890 --> 02:02:04,210
Yeah, yeah.

4152
02:02:05,570 --> 02:02:06,510
Almost the end!

4153
02:02:06,570 --> 02:02:07,010
We did it.

4154
02:02:07,670 --> 02:02:08,770
We're gonna miss me.

4155
02:02:08,930 --> 02:02:10,070
We're gonna miss.

4156
02:02:11,010 --> 02:02:12,330
Go go go go go go.

4157
02:02:12,330 --> 02:02:13,330
Go go go!

4158
02:02:14,770 --> 02:02:15,510
There you go.

4159
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:16,270
There you go.

4160
02:02:16,850 --> 02:02:17,650
It's beautiful.

4161
02:02:19,030 --> 02:02:22,970
Oh my God, it will rise to a level where you can approach it and take flight.

4162
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:24,430
Wait, do we have to go to the ceiling?

4163
02:02:24,570 --> 02:02:24,590
What?

4164
02:02:24,990 --> 02:02:25,510
The roof?

4165
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:27,590
That's what the manager just said.

4166
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:29,610
Why do we get to the roof?

4167
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:31,750
Begin the flight.

4168
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:33,090
Wait...

4169
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:34,470
Are we going to the moon?

4170
02:02:34,810 --> 02:02:38,350
The moon will push... Take the elevator to the roof!

4171
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:39,790
This way, this way, this way!

4172
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:41,950
Remember, it's the meow, remember the meow-meows.

4173
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:42,790
Meow-meows!

4174
02:02:43,410 --> 02:02:44,450
And meow-meows.

4175
02:02:44,710 --> 02:02:45,230
Meow-meows.

4176
02:02:46,330 --> 02:02:48,030
There's a marker on the map.

4177
02:02:48,370 --> 02:02:48,550
Yeah.

4178
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:49,290
Oh, there is?

4179
02:02:49,630 --> 02:02:49,830
Oh.

4180
02:02:50,330 --> 02:02:50,970
Okay, maybe not the meow-meows.

4181
02:02:50,970 --> 02:02:52,390
Yeah, you're going the wrong way.

4182
02:02:52,770 --> 02:02:53,670
Oh my god.

4183
02:02:56,810 --> 02:02:58,370
Okay, does someone else need?

4184
02:02:58,750 --> 02:03:00,250
Yeah, someone with the map.

4185
02:03:00,930 --> 02:03:02,330
Mimi, we nominate you.

4186
02:03:02,630 --> 02:03:02,910
It's this way.

4187
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:03,310
It's this way.

4188
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:03,710
Oh no.

4189
02:03:05,250 --> 02:03:05,690
Right?

4190
02:03:05,690 --> 02:03:06,970
Maybe I'm going the wrong way.

4191
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:08,050
Yeah.

4192
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:08,510
In here.

4193
02:03:08,590 --> 02:03:09,190
This way.

4194
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:09,910
That way?

4195
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:14,620
Hello, little creature.

4196
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,320
This way.

4197
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,860
Please ignore me.

4198
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:20,940
And it's, like, right in front of us.

4199
02:03:21,080 --> 02:03:21,400
Oh, right here.

4200
02:03:21,600 --> 02:03:21,760
Oh!

4201
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:23,000
Oh, is this always here?

4202
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:23,940
Yeah.

4203
02:03:23,980 --> 02:03:24,860
Um, yeah.

4204
02:03:25,460 --> 02:03:25,880
I don't know.

4205
02:03:26,200 --> 02:03:27,660
Did you just never see this elevator?

4206
02:03:30,180 --> 02:03:30,800
Wait, did I?

4207
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:31,560
Oh, it's coming.

4208
02:03:31,640 --> 02:03:31,940
Yeah, yeah.

4209
02:03:32,080 --> 02:03:32,820
It's just a little slow.

4210
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Yeah, it's coming.

4211
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:34,040
Don't let that guy in.

4212
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:34,800
He's creepy.

4213
02:03:35,840 --> 02:03:36,060
He's going.

4214
02:03:36,380 --> 02:03:36,740
Don't.

4215
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:36,820
Don't.

4216
02:03:36,820 --> 02:03:37,100
Yeah, go.

4217
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:37,340
Oh.

4218
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,040
Back to the roof.

4219
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:40,200
That could be Wraith right now.

4220
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:41,140
You don't know that.

4221
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:42,920
Wraith?

4222
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,060
Yeah, he's been with us the whole time in Spear.

4223
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:46,440
Yeah, he's been with us.

4224
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:48,000
That's a little scary, though.

4225
02:03:48,220 --> 02:03:48,220
Yeah.

4226
02:03:48,920 --> 02:03:49,160
Whoa.

4227
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:49,460
Whoa.

4228
02:03:50,100 --> 02:03:50,720
Whoa.

4229
02:03:51,060 --> 02:03:51,740
It's a cat.

4230
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:54,280
Oh, the cat.

4231
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:56,180
Can we talk to her?

4232
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,900
Fly away with the moon is our objective.

4233
02:04:01,180 --> 02:04:01,800
Kitten.

4234
02:04:02,700 --> 02:04:03,180
Kitten.

4235
02:04:04,890 --> 02:04:06,200
The girlfriend's over here.

4236
02:04:06,300 --> 02:04:07,860
Yeah, I see her standing over there.

4237
02:04:07,860 --> 02:04:08,160
Oh.

4238
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:10,820
She's coming home with me.

4239
02:04:11,140 --> 02:04:13,860
She's going to pick us up and spin us and throw us into the moon.

4240
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:15,840
I hope so, actually.

4241
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:18,220
Hello, giant woman.

4242
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:19,020
Oh, okay.

4243
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,220
Your wife's time.

4244
02:04:20,600 --> 02:04:22,760
She says, it seems like this is the end.

4245
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:25,720
The moon is already waiting for you.

4246
02:04:26,500 --> 02:04:28,680
And yet you managed to pull it off.

4247
02:04:29,560 --> 02:04:30,320
That's it.

4248
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:31,220
That's it.

4249
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:32,420
We're going home.

4250
02:04:32,420 --> 02:04:33,940
Fly away now.

4251
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:35,720
Fly away now.

4252
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:38,700
Fly away now.

4253
02:04:39,500 --> 02:04:40,860
Fly away now.

4254
02:04:41,200 --> 02:04:41,740
Oh, you guys?

4255
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:49,450
Wait, she's still talking?

4256
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:50,150
My girl.

4257
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:50,930
Goodbye, clever.

4258
02:04:50,950 --> 02:04:52,910
Yeah, you're missing your girlfriend's speech.

4259
02:04:53,090 --> 02:04:53,590
Oh, my bad.

4260
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:55,350
She doesn't want to come to space with us.

4261
02:04:55,350 --> 02:04:56,690
You're not going to come to space with us.

4262
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:57,590
Go on, sweetie.

4263
02:05:02,390 --> 02:05:03,450
There's a bridge here.

4264
02:05:05,870 --> 02:05:07,470
What's your final words to your wife?

4265
02:05:09,110 --> 02:05:11,430
I love you and latex.

4266
02:05:12,410 --> 02:05:14,930
It's time to say goodbye to this place and move on.

4267
02:05:15,110 --> 02:05:16,250
I'm not ready.

4268
02:05:19,230 --> 02:05:20,930
Okay, that's the last thing she says.

4269
02:05:21,330 --> 02:05:21,670
All right.

4270
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:22,530
It's time, guys.

4271
02:05:22,630 --> 02:05:23,370
Are we all ready?

4272
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:23,870
Yeah.

4273
02:05:23,870 --> 02:05:24,190
Yeah.

4274
02:05:24,490 --> 02:05:25,230
Let's go.

4275
02:05:25,690 --> 02:05:27,730
I'll never forget you, space lady.

4276
02:05:29,390 --> 02:05:32,990
Thank you for making her the happiest mess around.

4277
02:05:36,110 --> 02:05:38,550
I'll never forget the bachelor party.

4278
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:41,750
Wait, are we actually going to see space now?

4279
02:05:41,970 --> 02:05:42,670
That'd be crazy.

4280
02:05:43,690 --> 02:05:45,510
I mean, that's why we put on the space.

4281
02:05:45,510 --> 02:05:46,650
Then the real game starts.

4282
02:05:47,030 --> 02:05:47,610
Yeah, the real.

4283
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:49,130
Are you guys ready?

4284
02:05:49,330 --> 02:05:50,310
Oh, she's a little small.

4285
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:51,470
Set out on a journey.

4286
02:05:51,730 --> 02:05:52,370
I know, right?

4287
02:05:53,870 --> 02:05:55,290
We're going to live inside of it.

4288
02:05:55,510 --> 02:05:56,810
We'll all have to be nearby.

4289
02:05:58,370 --> 02:05:59,070
Here we go.

4290
02:05:59,610 --> 02:06:00,170
Oh, oh.

4291
02:06:01,410 --> 02:06:01,890
Moonwalking?

4292
02:06:04,930 --> 02:06:05,770
It's us.

4293
02:06:06,230 --> 02:06:07,810
I can't believe I'm white now.

4294
02:06:09,930 --> 02:06:11,650
Everybody else got to put on their color.

4295
02:06:11,790 --> 02:06:12,850
Oh, there we go.

4296
02:06:17,010 --> 02:06:17,490
Girlfriend.

4297
02:06:19,770 --> 02:06:21,350
I lost my girlfriend.

4298
02:06:21,590 --> 02:06:22,350
I lost my cat.

4299
02:06:22,890 --> 02:06:24,110
Worst ending ever.

4300
02:06:26,330 --> 02:06:26,810
Bye.

4301
02:06:27,770 --> 02:06:29,790
Oh, I wish we could all talk to each other.

4302
02:06:31,370 --> 02:06:33,050
Are all the creatures going to disappear?

4303
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:34,450
Oh, the mission is complete.

4304
02:06:34,450 --> 02:06:35,570
Says manager-san.

4305
02:06:37,670 --> 02:06:40,350
Once you reach the border, our agents will pick you up outside.

4306
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:41,750
Over and out.

4307
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:43,310
Over and out.

4308
02:06:43,310 --> 02:06:43,710
Finish the...

4309
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:45,270
Look at us.

4310
02:06:45,270 --> 02:06:46,010
We're tiny.

4311
02:06:46,190 --> 02:06:47,810
We're tiny little dots.

4312
02:06:49,370 --> 02:06:49,810
Yay!

4313
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:56,940
Yay!

4314
02:06:57,980 --> 02:06:59,080
Oh, let me...

4315
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:02,860
I was gonna unmute them, but it...

4316
02:07:02,860 --> 02:07:04,320
It like...

4317
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:07,860
Cuts the game audio.

4318
02:07:08,860 --> 02:07:11,200
I can still hear that thing breathing, though.

4319
02:07:13,460 --> 02:07:14,080
Hello?

4320
02:07:15,060 --> 02:07:15,680
Hello?

4321
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:16,320
Hello?

4322
02:07:17,860 --> 02:07:18,520
We're back?

4323
02:07:18,820 --> 02:07:19,660
How do we...

4324
02:07:19,660 --> 02:07:21,140
Why are we back?

4325
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:23,500
New gameplays!

4326
02:07:23,720 --> 02:07:26,000
I thought we all flew away.

4327
02:07:26,660 --> 02:07:26,960
Wait.

4328
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:27,060
Wait.

4329
02:07:27,680 --> 02:07:28,580
What happened?

4330
02:07:28,760 --> 02:07:29,240
Where is...

4331
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:30,960
Wait, the creatures are still here, even.

4332
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:33,080
Oh, my God.

4333
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:33,860
Wait, like...

4334
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,440
Did we not...

4335
02:07:35,440 --> 02:07:36,500
We beat the game, though.

4336
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:38,020
Yeah, we beat it.

4337
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:38,660
We beat it.

4338
02:07:38,660 --> 02:07:39,500
I got a scheme achievement.

4339
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:39,980
Yeah.

4340
02:07:40,240 --> 02:07:40,420
Yeah.

4341
02:07:41,580 --> 02:07:42,680
Like, it was...

4342
02:07:42,680 --> 02:07:44,260
We got kicked off the moon.

4343
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:44,840
A cat!

4344
02:07:44,840 --> 02:07:45,000
Wait.

4345
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:47,020
Oh, wait.

4346
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:47,480
Okay.

4347
02:07:48,700 --> 02:07:48,840
Okay.

4348
02:07:49,640 --> 02:07:50,400
Oh, scary.

4349
02:07:50,740 --> 02:07:51,960
Aw, he's happy.

4350
02:07:52,480 --> 02:07:53,040
He's fine.

4351
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:53,760
He's secure.

4352
02:07:54,480 --> 02:07:56,080
He's not evil anymore.

4353
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:57,280
Wait, is the moon up there?

4354
02:07:57,500 --> 02:07:57,900
Wait.

4355
02:07:58,140 --> 02:07:58,400
Maybe...

4356
02:07:58,400 --> 02:08:01,080
Maybe this was for, like, the TV head guy.

4357
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:03,440
If you put the orange on his head when the moon is already out.

4358
02:08:03,820 --> 02:08:05,980
Then he, like, lives on the moon with us.

4359
02:08:06,140 --> 02:08:09,380
But since we did it early, he just floated off into endlessly.

4360
02:08:12,140 --> 02:08:12,580
Oh, he's just...

4361
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:14,920
We did the order of operations a little wrong.

4362
02:08:16,140 --> 02:08:19,040
Wait, I thought the creatures were supposed to be gone, though.

4363
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:20,460
I still see them walking around.

4364
02:08:20,460 --> 02:08:21,080
Oh, wait.

4365
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:22,960
There's two TV heads here we could talk to.

4366
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:24,480
Maybe they're gonna fly away.

4367
02:08:24,960 --> 02:08:25,280
Oh, yeah.

4368
02:08:25,340 --> 02:08:25,760
Strange.

4369
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,700
You left with the moon, then?

4370
02:08:28,820 --> 02:08:30,060
Yeah, we thought so.

4371
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:32,360
Yeah, we all floated away.

4372
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:32,660
Yeah.

4373
02:08:34,620 --> 02:08:36,020
Did we forget to finish something?

4374
02:08:36,620 --> 02:08:39,060
Oh, I guess it's New Game Plus and we didn't do...

4375
02:08:39,060 --> 02:08:40,280
No moon here anymore.

4376
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,400
Aw.

4377
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:42,160
Aw.

4378
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:43,340
That was fun, guys.

4379
02:08:43,800 --> 02:08:44,320
No way.

4380
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:45,120
Yeah.

4381
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:46,400
Yeah.

4382
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,520
I told you the yellow women had a plan.

4383
02:08:49,200 --> 02:08:49,520
Uh-huh.

4384
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:50,060
Yeah.

4385
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:50,580
Mm-hmm.

4386
02:08:50,780 --> 02:08:52,720
I mean, that was faster than I thought it would be.

4387
02:08:52,980 --> 02:08:53,660
Yeah, I thought so.

4388
02:08:53,660 --> 02:08:53,900
Yeah.

4389
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,380
This guy on YouTube only one hour.

4390
02:08:55,800 --> 02:08:56,200
Yeah.

4391
02:08:56,580 --> 02:08:56,720
Yeah.

4392
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:58,480
We had all the information, okay?

4393
02:08:58,640 --> 02:08:59,560
That guy was cheating.

4394
02:09:00,120 --> 02:09:00,320
Yeah, yeah.

4395
02:09:00,320 --> 02:09:02,180
We figured it out as we went along.

4396
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:04,380
So you never doubt our plan.

4397
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:06,560
It was good.

4398
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:07,120
It was good.

4399
02:09:07,380 --> 02:09:07,680
Yeah, yeah.

4400
02:09:08,340 --> 02:09:10,820
Yeah, I had a fun time with all of you guys today.

4401
02:09:10,820 --> 02:09:11,480
Yeah.

4402
02:09:11,700 --> 02:09:14,800
And also, like, when we first started the game, I did not ex...

4403
02:09:14,800 --> 02:09:15,420
I...

4404
02:09:15,420 --> 02:09:17,180
Honestly, I don't know what we just did.

4405
02:09:17,500 --> 02:09:18,240
Like, I...

4406
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:20,540
I'm a little confused on the plot of the story.

4407
02:09:20,540 --> 02:09:20,920
Yeah, me too.

4408
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:21,420
Me too.

4409
02:09:22,080 --> 02:09:25,460
What we did is played more than two hours so we could never return the game.

4410
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:26,160
I know.

4411
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:28,840
No, it was cool, though.

4412
02:09:28,920 --> 02:09:29,400
It was cool.

4413
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:29,940
It was, yeah.

4414
02:09:29,940 --> 02:09:31,380
Maybe we'll add more to it.

4415
02:09:31,420 --> 02:09:33,260
Maybe we'll add a second moon, you know?

4416
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:33,840
Oh, no.

4417
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:35,080
Oh, the DLC.

4418
02:09:35,700 --> 02:09:38,260
Some of those bosses, I never want to see again.

4419
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:38,980
I think I'm good.

4420
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:39,920
Yeah.

4421
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:40,440
Yeah.

4422
02:09:40,820 --> 02:09:43,660
The one that, like, just, like, punts us to the ground.

4423
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:44,400
I know.

4424
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:45,840
That guy is horrible.

4425
02:09:47,660 --> 02:09:51,340
Like, like, he always comes out of nowhere, too.

4426
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:53,560
Like, we don't even know when he shows up.

4427
02:09:53,940 --> 02:09:54,020
Yeah.

4428
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:57,280
I wish we could see the, like, a death count of who died the most.

4429
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:57,440
Yeah.

4430
02:09:57,940 --> 02:10:02,760
Oh, I'm pretty sure someone in our chat can, like, do a compilation of that.

4431
02:10:02,900 --> 02:10:04,320
If anybody has time.

4432
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:04,860
Yeah.

4433
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:08,040
Me and Nimi are in sync.

4434
02:10:08,980 --> 02:10:09,400
We are.

4435
02:10:09,840 --> 02:10:10,480
Oh, my gosh.

4436
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:11,400
Yeah, you guys are.

4437
02:10:13,940 --> 02:10:15,280
We should line up.

4438
02:10:15,340 --> 02:10:17,980
We should, like, line up on the edge of the building and do, like, a...

4439
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:18,560
Oh!

4440
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:19,940
A synced dance.

4441
02:10:20,180 --> 02:10:20,440
Oh, yeah!

4442
02:10:20,440 --> 02:10:21,620
That's so true, but which hands?

4443
02:10:22,020 --> 02:10:22,420
Which...

4444
02:10:22,420 --> 02:10:22,980
A Macarena?

4445
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:24,260
The Macarena?

4446
02:10:24,600 --> 02:10:25,180
Yeah, which one is red.

4447
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:26,040
Which number?

4448
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:26,860
Let's do, like...

4449
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:27,780
I'll stand right here, fine.

4450
02:10:28,060 --> 02:10:28,920
Wait, which number?

4451
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:30,140
Which number?

4452
02:10:31,100 --> 02:10:32,240
Which way do we face?

4453
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:33,500
Do we face...

4454
02:10:33,500 --> 02:10:34,960
Maybe in a line, like, yeah.

4455
02:10:35,380 --> 02:10:35,820
Like that?

4456
02:10:36,100 --> 02:10:36,380
Okay.

4457
02:10:36,380 --> 02:10:36,500
Okay.

4458
02:10:36,600 --> 02:10:38,420
Someone has to tell us the number to do.

4459
02:10:38,820 --> 02:10:39,200
Okay.

4460
02:10:39,340 --> 02:10:39,980
Which way...

4461
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:42,020
Which way do we face?

4462
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:42,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4463
02:10:42,440 --> 02:10:42,720
Licking.

4464
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:46,280
Alright, alright.

4465
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:47,060
How about...

4466
02:10:47,560 --> 02:10:48,120
What number?

4467
02:10:48,380 --> 02:10:48,600
What dance?

4468
02:10:49,240 --> 02:10:50,000
Dance 2?

4469
02:10:50,260 --> 02:10:50,780
Dance 2?

4470
02:10:50,980 --> 02:10:51,760
No, that's the chicken dance.

4471
02:10:52,740 --> 02:10:54,100
Wait, this looks so good!

4472
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:00,400
Okay, okay.

4473
02:11:00,660 --> 02:11:01,440
We'll do a countdown.

4474
02:11:01,700 --> 02:11:02,260
Are you guys ready?

4475
02:11:02,660 --> 02:11:03,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4476
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,340
What dance 2?

4477
02:11:04,540 --> 02:11:05,700
It's dance 2, yeah.

4478
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:06,080
Okay.

4479
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:07,360
Wait, how do I...

4480
02:11:07,360 --> 02:11:07,800
Wait, hold on.

4481
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:08,960
Oh, I gotta stop.

4482
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:09,560
Okay, alright.

4483
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:12,000
I'll do it on one, okay?

4484
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:12,960
How do you stop?

4485
02:11:14,060 --> 02:11:15,360
Oh, you just have to move a little bit.

4486
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:15,820
Yeah, yeah.

4487
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:16,600
Okay.

4488
02:11:17,380 --> 02:11:17,740
3...

4489
02:11:18,520 --> 02:11:18,880
2...

4490
02:11:19,360 --> 02:11:19,720
1...

4491
02:11:22,460 --> 02:11:23,560
How are we in?

4492
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:24,720
How are we in?

4493
02:11:25,140 --> 02:11:25,500
Like...

4494
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:28,300
None of us...

4495
02:11:28,300 --> 02:11:29,960
How are none of us in sync at all?

4496
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:32,760
1...

4497
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:33,180
2...

4498
02:11:34,020 --> 02:11:34,340
2...

4499
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:34,960
2...

4500
02:11:35,800 --> 02:11:35,860
2...

4501
02:11:35,860 --> 02:11:37,060
2...

4502
02:11:37,060 --> 02:11:38,640
Alright, switch to dance 8.

4503
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:39,660
1...

4504
02:11:39,660 --> 02:11:40,080
3...

4505
02:11:40,080 --> 02:11:40,540
2...

4506
02:11:40,540 --> 02:11:41,040
1...

4507
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:41,460
Oh, oh.

4508
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:42,300
Oh, oh.

4509
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:42,320
Ah!

4510
02:11:42,700 --> 02:11:42,980
Dancing!

4511
02:11:43,920 --> 02:11:44,680
We're in sync!

4512
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:45,560
We're in sync!

4513
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:46,300
We're in sync!

4514
02:11:46,300 --> 02:11:46,500
We're in sync!

4515
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:47,220
We're in sync!

4516
02:11:47,220 --> 02:11:47,460
Okay.

4517
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:48,680
Um...

4518
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:50,500
Maybe not me, though.

4519
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,360
It kind of works.

4520
02:11:53,480 --> 02:11:54,160
It's like a delay.

4521
02:11:54,160 --> 02:11:55,080
It's like on first.

4522
02:11:55,300 --> 02:11:55,940
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4523
02:11:56,020 --> 02:11:56,500
Yeah, yeah.

4524
02:11:56,680 --> 02:11:57,640
That's true, that's true.

4525
02:11:57,760 --> 02:11:58,540
I like this one.

4526
02:12:03,060 --> 02:12:06,680
You guys saw how everybody calls this green and yellow woman, right?

4527
02:12:07,180 --> 02:12:07,400
Yeah.

4528
02:12:07,680 --> 02:12:07,820
Yeah.

4529
02:12:08,020 --> 02:12:08,460
Yeah, exactly.

4530
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:09,280
Oh, yeah.

4531
02:12:12,080 --> 02:12:12,960
Very creative.

4532
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:15,220
Very, very creative.

4533
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:16,380
This is good.

4534
02:12:16,660 --> 02:12:17,360
This is good.

4535
02:12:17,500 --> 02:12:17,840
This is good.

4536
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:20,280
GG's, guys.

4537
02:12:20,920 --> 02:12:21,000
Woo!

4538
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:21,700
What a journey.

4539
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:22,800
GG's!

4540
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:26,080
I think this was a mission success for us.

4541
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:26,800
Yeah!

4542
02:12:27,820 --> 02:12:28,120
Damn.

4543
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:31,940
I love these stupid horror games, so I'm always down.

4544
02:12:31,960 --> 02:12:32,660
Me too!

4545
02:12:33,930 --> 02:12:34,540
That's fun.

4546
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:36,040
Kusoge.

4547
02:12:39,200 --> 02:12:40,460
I love it.

4548
02:12:40,620 --> 02:12:41,140
Me too.

4549
02:12:41,740 --> 02:12:42,700
Especially like...

4550
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:44,380
Boy's Proximity.

4551
02:12:44,380 --> 02:12:45,060
Yeah!

4552
02:12:48,420 --> 02:12:50,140
Hey guys, can we do flip?

4553
02:12:50,760 --> 02:12:51,200
Alright.

4554
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:51,740
Do a flip!

4555
02:12:52,740 --> 02:12:54,880
Three, two, one!

4556
02:12:56,240 --> 02:12:56,740
What?

4557
02:13:05,040 --> 02:13:06,440
Wait, what is F?

4558
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:08,180
What?

4559
02:13:08,460 --> 02:13:09,180
What's F?

4560
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:09,520
Oh!

4561
02:13:10,060 --> 02:13:10,760
It's the new.

4562
02:13:10,760 --> 02:13:10,800
It's the new.

4563
02:13:11,120 --> 02:13:13,900
Whenever someone dies, I'll be sure of them died!

4564
02:13:14,280 --> 02:13:14,480
I can't remember.

4565
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:14,720
I can't remember.

4566
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:15,880
I didn't even see it.

4567
02:13:17,660 --> 02:13:20,780
Every time someone dies, we could've all been around their body.

4568
02:13:21,100 --> 02:13:22,200
That flip was awesome!

4569
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,120
That was a pretty cool flip.

4570
02:13:26,220 --> 02:13:28,260
Someone should make a montage of just that flip.

4571
02:13:28,560 --> 02:13:29,740
With different perspectives.

4572
02:13:30,600 --> 02:13:30,800
You know?

4573
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,140
GG's, guys.

4574
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:37,260
I had a great time with all of you.

4575
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:38,960
With my green and yellow one.

4576
02:13:39,020 --> 02:13:39,420
Yeah!

4577
02:13:40,140 --> 02:13:40,700
GG's.

4578
02:13:40,700 --> 02:13:41,520
Until like...

4579
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:43,440
I hope we get to play something again.

4580
02:13:43,660 --> 02:13:43,940
Yeah!

4581
02:13:44,640 --> 02:13:44,940
Yeah!

4582
02:13:45,460 --> 02:13:45,700
Yeah!

4583
02:13:47,660 --> 02:13:48,500
GG's, guys.

4584
02:13:48,600 --> 02:13:51,040
I guess we'll all talk to our chat now.

4585
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:51,580
Okay!

4586
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:51,980
Okay!

4587
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:53,580
Bye-bye!

4588
02:13:54,140 --> 02:13:54,620
Bye-bye!

4589
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:55,640
Bye-bye!

4590
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:09,860
Bye-bye!

4591
02:14:09,860 --> 02:14:11,040
The entire server closes.

4592
02:14:11,260 --> 02:14:12,860
Wait, I wanna see if I can die by this thing.

4593
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,160
Oh, okay.

4594
02:14:14,440 --> 02:14:15,360
I guess we can F her.

4595
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:18,620
Kill me!

4596
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:26,600
You can still die.

4597
02:14:28,620 --> 02:14:28,880
Oh.

4598
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:30,540
Oh.

4599
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:33,100
Oh.

4600
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:33,720
Yay!

4601
02:14:35,100 --> 02:14:35,620
Okay.

4602
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:39,470
I'm going to...

4603
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:41,290
Leave the Discord...

4604
02:14:42,610 --> 02:14:43,130
Call...

4605
02:14:44,190 --> 02:14:46,730
I have to remember to turn their volume up, though.

4606
02:14:48,270 --> 02:14:48,750
Wait!

4607
02:14:49,050 --> 02:14:50,870
Was the moon always in the sky?

4608
02:14:51,750 --> 02:14:52,750
At the menu?

4609
02:14:53,890 --> 02:14:55,190
Or did we do that?

4610
02:14:56,310 --> 02:14:57,810
Yeah, the moon is up there now!

4611
02:14:58,610 --> 02:14:59,430
Oh, so fun!

4612
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:01,450
I'm kind of curious, though.

4613
02:15:01,590 --> 02:15:02,230
What else is...

4614
02:15:02,890 --> 02:15:04,630
What else do you do...

4615
02:15:04,630 --> 02:15:05,510
At...

4616
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:06,310
The end.

4617
02:15:06,590 --> 02:15:06,810
You know?

4618
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:08,710
Because it's...

4619
02:15:08,710 --> 02:15:09,750
They were like, oh...

4620
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:10,950
What did you forget to do here?

4621
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:12,290
Nothing?

4622
02:15:12,670 --> 02:15:13,130
I don't know.

4623
02:15:13,270 --> 02:15:13,990
Bring back my girl?

4624
02:15:16,430 --> 02:15:16,870
Hmm...

4625
02:15:16,870 --> 02:15:17,270
No?

4626
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:18,230
There's nothing else?

4627
02:15:19,670 --> 02:15:21,150
Maybe just explore the map?

4628
02:15:21,330 --> 02:15:22,290
But you can still die!

4629
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:24,170
I don't wanna just explore the map...

4630
02:15:24,990 --> 02:15:27,370
Where there's so many things coming at me, no?

4631
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:31,990
In case you didn't do the orange head quest...

4632
02:15:31,990 --> 02:15:32,270
Maybe.

4633
02:15:32,270 --> 02:15:33,810
Oh, some Easter eggs!

4634
02:15:34,070 --> 02:15:35,450
That's true, that's true, that's true.

4635
02:15:37,510 --> 02:15:38,210
That's true.

4636
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:41,330
Yay!

4637
02:15:41,870 --> 02:15:42,670
That was so fun!

4638
02:15:42,990 --> 02:15:44,250
It was a bit of a short day.

4639
02:15:44,250 --> 02:15:45,230
I hope you guys don't mind.

4640
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:48,250
But my throat is really hurting me.

4641
02:15:51,110 --> 02:15:52,650
So, I think I'm gonna take it easy.

4642
02:15:53,090 --> 02:15:53,530
Oh wait, hold on.

4643
02:15:53,610 --> 02:15:54,990
Let me get a mint, actually.

4644
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,780
I have some...

4645
02:16:01,760 --> 02:16:02,720
Nodoame tablet.

4646
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:04,120
This is a honey lemon.

4647
02:16:13,270 --> 02:16:15,890
Oh yeah, we didn't collect the books, that's so true.

4648
02:16:16,630 --> 02:16:16,990
Hmm.

4649
02:16:17,970 --> 02:16:19,210
So I guess if you're going after...

4650
02:16:19,210 --> 02:16:20,590
Oh wait, I wanna see, I'm curious.

4651
02:16:21,130 --> 02:16:23,370
I'm gonna go see what the achievements are on Steam.

4652
02:16:24,650 --> 02:16:25,510
Um, what is this?

4653
02:16:26,210 --> 02:16:26,570
Emissary.

4654
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:27,830
Zero.

4655
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:29,930
There was more...

4656
02:16:30,430 --> 02:16:31,890
Story to it than I...

4657
02:16:32,730 --> 02:16:33,510
Imagine, you know?

4658
02:16:33,570 --> 02:16:34,950
I thought it was gonna be like one of those...

4659
02:16:35,630 --> 02:16:38,390
Uh, like, repo, or something like that kind of games.

4660
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:39,850
But no, it actually...

4661
02:16:41,050 --> 02:16:42,590
It actually was a thing.

4662
02:16:42,730 --> 02:16:42,950
Wait.

4663
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:44,510
Oh, okay, here we go.

4664
02:16:50,620 --> 02:16:51,840
Wait, I'm confused.

4665
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:52,320
What...

4666
02:16:52,320 --> 02:16:53,180
Which ones did I get?

4667
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:54,280
Okay, so there's...

4668
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:54,440
Meow?

4669
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:55,940
What is meow, I wonder?

4670
02:16:56,800 --> 02:16:58,580
Supremacy of the black liquid.

4671
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,480
Collect all Easter eggs.

4672
02:17:00,780 --> 02:17:02,460
Complete the quest of the smiling...

4673
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:03,560
TV head.

4674
02:17:03,820 --> 02:17:07,360
You guys, only 0.1% of players...

4675
02:17:08,220 --> 02:17:09,240
Gets the...

4676
02:17:09,240 --> 02:17:10,680
Smiling TV head.

4677
02:17:11,680 --> 02:17:12,200
Achievement.

4678
02:17:12,500 --> 02:17:13,940
And then orange shards.

4679
02:17:14,080 --> 02:17:14,940
I don't know what that one is.

4680
02:17:15,720 --> 02:17:19,360
Yeah, there was one, two, three, four, five, six...

4681
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,260
Achievements we didn't get.

4682
02:17:21,640 --> 02:17:23,340
Collect all the map fragments.

4683
02:17:23,720 --> 02:17:25,180
Collect all the special items.

4684
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:26,960
What is the black liquid?

4685
02:17:28,800 --> 02:17:29,920
And then meow.

4686
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:31,420
There's something...

4687
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:32,940
There's an achievement with the cat.

4688
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:34,080
We missed it.

4689
02:17:34,740 --> 02:17:35,340
Sad.

4690
02:17:36,060 --> 02:17:37,600
I wouldn't call it a story.

4691
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:38,560
Well...

4692
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:39,620
There was a...

4693
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:42,260
Kind of a...

4694
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:43,520
You know what I meant.

4695
02:17:43,700 --> 02:17:44,320
Maybe.

4696
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:47,740
There was more of a narrative than not.

4697
02:17:48,020 --> 02:17:49,120
More than repo.

4698
02:17:51,960 --> 02:17:52,680
Yeah.

4699
02:17:53,660 --> 02:17:54,340
Right.

4700
02:17:56,080 --> 02:17:58,500
Black liquid, some sort of Death Stranding reference.

4701
02:17:59,340 --> 02:18:00,060
Mayhaps.

4702
02:18:00,320 --> 02:18:00,740
Mayhaps.

4703
02:18:02,060 --> 02:18:03,180
But that was so fun.

4704
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:06,080
I'm glad Nimi also said that she likes these types of games.

4705
02:18:06,440 --> 02:18:06,920
Because...

4706
02:18:06,920 --> 02:18:08,260
I love these types of games.

4707
02:18:08,900 --> 02:18:09,380
So...

4708
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,940
I would be happy to play...

4709
02:18:11,940 --> 02:18:13,760
With her and of course...

4710
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:14,460
Tokidubi.

4711
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:17,040
I like our little team.

4712
02:18:19,120 --> 02:18:20,460
It was a lot of fun.

4713
02:18:20,680 --> 02:18:21,360
It was a lot of fun.

4714
02:18:22,720 --> 02:18:23,200
Yeah.

4715
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:25,800
The proximity voice.

4716
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:26,860
Yeah, so good.

4717
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:27,680
Hehehe.

4718
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:30,000
It was a coherent weirdness.

4719
02:18:32,620 --> 02:18:33,640
Thanks for the month's dream.

4720
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:34,360
Hope you feel better.

4721
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:36,180
Don't be afraid to cancel or remove tomorrow's dream.

4722
02:18:36,260 --> 02:18:38,660
I think tomorrow's dream won't be so long.

4723
02:18:41,620 --> 02:18:42,140
Um...

4724
02:18:43,140 --> 02:18:45,180
Because I think Kirby is actually quite sh...

4725
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:46,800
The first Kirby is quite short.

4726
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:47,900
So...

4727
02:18:47,900 --> 02:18:52,320
I anticipated it on not being super duper long.

4728
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:55,980
Kinda just taking it easy.

4729
02:18:58,840 --> 02:18:59,800
With uh...

4730
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:00,480
With...

4731
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,760
With um...

4732
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,880
I guess today and tomorrow.

4733
02:19:03,180 --> 02:19:03,640
Because...

4734
02:19:03,640 --> 02:19:04,640
Today was pretty short too.

4735
02:19:05,100 --> 02:19:05,260
Hehehe.

4736
02:19:06,440 --> 02:19:08,460
Are you planning on doing Kirby series?

4737
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:08,840
Yeah!

4738
02:19:09,180 --> 02:19:09,920
I wanna play...

4739
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:11,980
I wanna play more Kirby's.

4740
02:19:15,740 --> 02:19:16,700
I want to.

4741
02:19:17,480 --> 02:19:18,420
I want to play...

4742
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,460
So I was just like...

4743
02:19:19,460 --> 02:19:20,300
I want to play...

4744
02:19:20,300 --> 02:19:21,380
I want to try Kirby's.

4745
02:19:21,440 --> 02:19:22,740
So I will start at the first.

4746
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:23,300
Hehehe.

4747
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:25,040
So...

4748
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:25,460
Yay!

4749
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:28,460
Kirby Friday.

4750
02:19:28,680 --> 02:19:28,820
Whoops!

4751
02:19:29,120 --> 02:19:30,080
Saturday night.

4752
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:31,320
Hehehe.

4753
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:32,520
Hehehe.

4754
02:19:32,520 --> 02:19:32,800
Mm-mm.

4755
02:19:34,060 --> 02:19:35,660
The silhouette is giving me some...

4756
02:19:35,660 --> 02:19:37,060
Digicarrot vibes.

4757
02:19:37,180 --> 02:19:37,460
Right!

4758
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,840
When somebody pointed that out, I was like...

4759
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:40,560
Wait, I'm...

4760
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:44,560
I should finish all my sentences with Nyo.

4761
02:19:45,660 --> 02:19:46,580
Puchiko Nyo.

4762
02:19:46,740 --> 02:19:48,220
Actually, I own...

4763
02:19:48,220 --> 02:19:48,820
You know how like...

4764
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:49,920
Well, maybe...

4765
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:50,480
You don't know.

4766
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:51,600
A long long time ago...

4767
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,160
When Digicarrot...

4768
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:55,080
Was like...

4769
02:19:55,080 --> 02:19:56,180
Came...

4770
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:57,760
Was localized...

4771
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:58,740
In the US.

4772
02:19:58,740 --> 02:19:59,840
They released like...

4773
02:19:59,840 --> 02:20:00,320
The hats.

4774
02:20:00,540 --> 02:20:01,800
And I had both of them.

4775
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:04,820
I have both of them.

4776
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:05,580
I have both of them.

4777
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:07,520
Yeah...

4778
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:08,820
I think I still have...

4779
02:20:08,820 --> 02:20:10,320
My Dejiko one around.

4780
02:20:11,220 --> 02:20:11,580
Nyo.

4781
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:14,700
Wait...

4782
02:20:15,900 --> 02:20:17,620
Did Puchiko say Nyo?

4783
02:20:20,460 --> 02:20:21,920
Now wait, this is gonna bother me.

4784
02:20:22,660 --> 02:20:22,960
Wait...

4785
02:20:26,220 --> 02:20:27,520
She said Nyo!

4786
02:20:29,160 --> 02:20:31,080
And then Dejiko said Nyo.

4787
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:32,880
She says...

4788
02:20:32,880 --> 02:20:33,880
Puchiko says Nyo.

4789
02:20:34,040 --> 02:20:34,480
Oh my gosh.

4790
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:36,460
I'm a fake fan.

4791
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:39,040
I'm a fake fan.

4792
02:20:40,820 --> 02:20:42,080
This was good though.

4793
02:20:42,480 --> 02:20:43,520
This was a lot of fun.

4794
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:44,900
Hope you guys had fun.

4795
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:46,340
It was interesting.

4796
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:47,160
For sure.

4797
02:20:47,340 --> 02:20:48,180
To say the least.

4798
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:49,240
They were gaming.

4799
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:50,860
The yellow women were gaming.

4800
02:20:53,500 --> 02:20:54,060
But...

4801
02:20:54,060 --> 02:20:55,640
I gamed a little bit today too.

4802
02:20:56,220 --> 02:20:58,220
I had some crazy jukes, no?

4803
02:21:00,100 --> 02:21:02,080
I had some crazy jukes today.

4804
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:05,560
But...

4805
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,640
I'll be honest.

4806
02:21:07,320 --> 02:21:08,460
I was so...

4807
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:08,920
They were like...

4808
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:11,060
We gotta go put the electrical board here!

4809
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:12,780
I'm glad they remembered.

4810
02:21:12,900 --> 02:21:14,380
Because I was like...

4811
02:21:14,380 --> 02:21:14,720
Huh?

4812
02:21:16,380 --> 02:21:17,000
Whole.

4813
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:18,840
Whole.

4814
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:19,380
Whole.

4815
02:21:19,380 --> 02:21:20,180
Plot armor.

4816
02:21:21,360 --> 02:21:22,720
You had the password song.

4817
02:21:22,960 --> 02:21:25,980
If only I had the ability to put in the password.

4818
02:21:28,880 --> 02:21:29,880
That was good.

4819
02:21:30,260 --> 02:21:30,900
It was fun.

4820
02:21:34,840 --> 02:21:37,120
I was lost and I had no idea what the objectives...

4821
02:21:37,660 --> 02:21:40,160
The objectives were always in this left...

4822
02:21:40,160 --> 02:21:40,920
Top left corner.

4823
02:21:41,580 --> 02:21:42,780
But it would be like...

4824
02:21:42,780 --> 02:21:43,620
Go to this place!

4825
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:44,860
And I'm like...

4826
02:21:44,860 --> 02:21:46,320
Where is that place?

4827
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:49,040
Five...

4828
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:49,800
One...

4829
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:50,240
One...

4830
02:21:50,700 --> 02:21:51,000
Two...

4831
02:21:51,000 --> 02:21:51,720
One...

4832
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:52,240
Five...

4833
02:21:52,240 --> 02:21:53,060
One...

4834
02:21:53,060 --> 02:21:54,160
One...

4835
02:21:54,160 --> 02:21:54,760
Two...

4836
02:21:55,360 --> 02:21:55,800
One...

4837
02:21:55,800 --> 02:21:57,260
You know what was crazy too?

4838
02:21:57,260 --> 02:21:58,360
Is that even works.

4839
02:21:59,860 --> 02:22:01,620
Like the song actually helped.

4840
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:07,060
Yeah, the map was an absolute lifesaver.

4841
02:22:07,420 --> 02:22:08,200
Someone told me...

4842
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:09,940
I'm so sorry to the person...

4843
02:22:10,520 --> 02:22:11,320
That said...

4844
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:13,460
Hey, you should press the tab in chat.

4845
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:14,200
And I was like...

4846
02:22:14,200 --> 02:22:15,740
No, I'm pretty sure I tried that last time.

4847
02:22:16,440 --> 02:22:16,880
I...

4848
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:17,880
I don't know.

4849
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:18,680
I...

4850
02:22:18,680 --> 02:22:20,780
I could have sworn I tried it before.

4851
02:22:21,060 --> 02:22:22,540
But clearly I didn't.

4852
02:22:23,180 --> 02:22:24,300
So thank you.

4853
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:27,740
Yeah...

4854
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:32,380
Reminds me of Sunny's song from MGS.

4855
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:34,040
Da da da...

4856
02:22:44,330 --> 02:22:44,750
Ooh...

4857
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:45,590
Ooh...

4858
02:22:45,590 --> 02:22:46,470
Ooh...

4859
02:22:47,710 --> 02:22:48,550
Ooh...

4860
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:49,010
Ooh...

4861
02:22:49,010 --> 02:22:49,250
Ooh...

4862
02:22:50,270 --> 02:22:50,690
Ooh...

4863
02:22:51,110 --> 02:22:51,970
Ooh...

4864
02:22:51,970 --> 02:22:52,030
Ooh...

4865
02:22:53,610 --> 02:22:54,450
Ooh...

4866
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:54,950
Ooh...

4867
02:22:54,950 --> 02:22:55,390
Ah...

4868
02:22:56,530 --> 02:22:58,370
Music is always the answer.

4869
02:22:58,590 --> 02:22:59,470
So true.

4870
02:23:02,350 --> 02:23:04,110
There's an opera in my heart.

4871
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:05,950
And I just...

4872
02:23:06,470 --> 02:23:07,810
I just always...

4873
02:23:07,810 --> 02:23:09,290
I just gotta let it out sometimes.

4874
02:23:09,290 --> 02:23:09,950
I am so...

4875
02:23:13,010 --> 02:23:13,970
Well guys!

4876
02:23:15,830 --> 02:23:18,530
Thank you, for more Emissary Zero.

4877
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:20,170
Thanks for hanging out.

4878
02:23:20,690 --> 02:23:22,790
I hope you guys have a great weekend.

4879
02:23:23,110 --> 02:23:25,390
If I see you tomorrow for Kirby, I'll see you.

4880
02:23:27,410 --> 02:23:31,210
Um, enjoy, get some rest on your Friday.

4881
02:23:33,770 --> 02:23:35,470
And... I don't know what else to say.

4882
02:23:38,270 --> 02:23:38,770
No!

4883
02:23:38,970 --> 02:23:39,530
See you tomorrow!

4884
02:23:39,770 --> 02:23:40,330
See you tomorrow!

4885
02:23:41,750 --> 02:23:42,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4886
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:43,810
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

4887
02:23:45,430 --> 02:23:45,930
Teeheehee!

4888
02:23:46,430 --> 02:23:47,810
Perfect start to the weekend?

4889
02:23:48,110 --> 02:23:48,270
Ah!

4890
02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:54,810
Um, I got some... I got a little bit of...

4891
02:23:55,450 --> 02:23:56,490
Work to do.

4892
02:23:57,210 --> 02:23:59,050
Been a lot of like, clean up...

4893
02:23:59,050 --> 02:24:02,470
Um, contacting artists and stuff that I was working with.

4894
02:24:04,330 --> 02:24:07,190
To continue working on stuff, so...

4895
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:09,350
Um...

4896
02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:12,550
Trying to keep moving things in the pipeline, if possible.

4897
02:24:14,050 --> 02:24:14,690
Hmm...

4898
02:24:15,530 --> 02:24:16,170
So...

4899
02:24:16,170 --> 02:24:17,070
You, you, you!

4900
02:24:17,310 --> 02:24:19,190
A maid's job is never done.

4901
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:21,210
Hehehehe...

4902
02:24:21,210 --> 02:24:21,490
Yeah!

4903
02:24:22,150 --> 02:24:23,150
Very cool.

4904
02:24:23,690 --> 02:24:24,330
Hmm...

4905
02:24:25,030 --> 02:24:26,110
Good luck with work!

4906
02:24:26,210 --> 02:24:26,670
Thank you!

4907
02:24:27,790 --> 02:24:28,710
Thank you!

4908
02:24:28,710 --> 02:24:28,750
Thank you!

4909
02:24:30,010 --> 02:24:31,670
Yeah, we're, we're, um...

4910
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:32,910
We're making it work!

4911
02:24:33,250 --> 02:24:33,810
For all good!

4912
02:24:35,410 --> 02:24:35,970
Yeah!

4913
02:24:36,750 --> 02:24:38,290
It ain't easy being green!

4914
02:24:38,950 --> 02:24:40,270
I almost said greasy!

4915
02:24:40,270 --> 02:24:43,290
Like cheesy!

4916
02:24:43,750 --> 02:24:45,430
And green combined!

4917
02:24:46,090 --> 02:24:48,690
It ain't easy being greasy!

4918
02:24:51,650 --> 02:24:52,930
Hehehehe!

4919
02:24:52,930 --> 02:24:53,230
Hehehehe!

4920
02:24:53,230 --> 02:24:53,650
Hehehehe!

4921
02:24:54,390 --> 02:24:54,670
Hehehehe!

4922
02:24:54,670 --> 02:24:55,110
Hehehehe!

4923
02:24:56,130 --> 02:24:57,410
Hehehehe!

4924
02:24:58,270 --> 02:24:59,250
Hehehehe!

4925
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:00,170
Hehehehe!

4926
02:25:00,490 --> 02:25:01,250
Hehehehe!

4927
02:25:01,250 --> 02:25:01,310
Hehehehe!

4928
02:25:02,570 --> 02:25:03,610
Hehehehe!

4929
02:25:07,310 --> 02:25:08,590
Hehehehe!

4930
02:25:08,930 --> 02:25:09,890
Hehehehe!

4931
02:25:09,890 --> 02:25:10,930
Okay, thank you guys.

4932
02:25:11,310 --> 02:25:11,730
Thank you.

4933
02:25:11,910 --> 02:25:13,190
I appreciate you guys so much.

4934
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:15,350
Have a good rest of your night.

4935
02:25:16,910 --> 02:25:17,850
Take it easy.

4936
02:25:18,630 --> 02:25:19,210
Take it easy.

4937
02:25:19,850 --> 02:25:21,610
Oh no, I can't show you guys that.

4938
02:25:22,090 --> 02:25:26,370
I did see a preview for something that should be coming out soon and it looks really good.

4939
02:25:26,530 --> 02:25:27,590
I can tell you that at least.

4940
02:25:29,290 --> 02:25:30,710
It looks so good.

4941
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:34,230
Probably isn't easy being greasy either.

4942
02:25:34,510 --> 02:25:35,250
It's so true.

4943
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:47,180
Thank you guys so much.

4944
02:25:47,460 --> 02:25:48,200
Thank you, thank you.

4945
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:49,180
Oh.

4946
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:51,260
No.

4947
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:59,920
I was going to say something, but I think... I don't need... I think I'm still trying to decide what to do.

4948
02:26:02,040 --> 02:26:04,380
There were some things that I, like, was getting done.

4949
02:26:06,180 --> 02:26:10,240
But obviously, if debut was not happening anymore, I was like, oh, well...

4950
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:12,840
Maybe I'll just kind of roll stuff out as it comes.

4951
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:17,020
But I'm still trying to decide what to do.

4952
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:19,380
Sorry, that's so, like...

4953
02:26:19,380 --> 02:26:21,400
It's my own brain at work.

4954
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:22,860
I'm thinking out loud.

4955
02:26:23,120 --> 02:26:23,960
Okay, sorry.

4956
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:25,360
Okay, anyway.

4957
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:26,580
Bye-bye.

4958
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:29,660
See you guys later.

4959
02:26:29,780 --> 02:26:30,520
Thank you so much for watching.

4960
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:31,520
Thanks for hanging out.

4961
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:32,280
Bye-bye.

4962
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:33,060
Bye-bye.

4963
02:26:33,060 --> 02:26:33,460
Bye-bye.

4964
02:26:33,520 --> 02:26:34,100
Bye-bye.
