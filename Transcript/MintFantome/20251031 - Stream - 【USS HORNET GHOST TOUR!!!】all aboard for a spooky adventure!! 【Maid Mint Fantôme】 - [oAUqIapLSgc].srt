1
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,840
Wait, can you hear him?

2
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, I

3
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:47,090

4
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:48,570
What was that sound?

5
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,230
That's our tour guide setting up at the moment.

6
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,910

7
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,330

00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:02,710

11
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,850

We're on boat.

23
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,560
We're on boat.

24
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,740
Boat goes bintan?

25
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:19,660

31
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:48,120

32
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480

And the lights will flicker on and off.

36
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh wait, I don't know where the light switch is.

37
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,340
Anyways.

00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,740

Okay, well, Miss Mint, it's great to see you again.

51
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,500
My name is Gable Cherry.

52
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:01,340
I'm the marketing manager here at the USS Hart Sea Air in Space Museum.

53

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,660
I, the return of Jeff Gabe is upon us here.

60
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,120
This is truly a sign of the end times when Jeff Gabriel reemerges.

61
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,280
Jeff Gabe's here.

62
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,760
Well, it's kind of like the great pumpkin from Charlie Brown.

63
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,240
He will rise from beyond the ashes emerging out.

64
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,840
It's Jeff Gabe, Charlie Brown.

65
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,060
See, there you go.

66
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
It's a Jeff Gabe, Charlie Brown.

67
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,560
There you go.

68
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,820
Hey, that's the next Yellow Brown Christmas special right there.

69
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,900
It's a Jeff Gabe, Charlie Brown.

70
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,580
Yeah, it could be all, actually, it should be for every holiday.

71
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,780
Let's see.

72
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,400
There you go.

73
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,680
See, Jeff gave Valentine's, Jeff gave Kwanzaa, Jeff gave Leaf Erickson Day.

74
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,840
You know what Leaf Erickson Day?

75
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,880
You're all sponge-bobbed out tonight.

76
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,540
Listen, listen.

77
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,960
You don't understand the joy and the passion behind the people who celebrate Leaf Erickson Day.

78
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,360
Hinga dinga der again.

79
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,600
Oh, my God.

80
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,280
Leaf Erickson Day.

81
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,440
But anyways.

82
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:45,540
Smith is so glad that it's I'm just so glad to have you back man it is great you realize it's almost been almost an entire year since we did that tour wait no way that's crazy that is crazy our prior conversation we're talking about how 2019 was like six years ago okay we did I okay we had a conversation we were talking about ace combat and I was like oh ace combat seven was from 2019 and I was like that's only six years ago the old yet boomers Jesus.

83
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,380
Who here remembers Red Mountain Dew gamer juice.

84
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,960
That's before we had gamer subs.

85
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,440
Wait, I don't even know that.

86
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,700
You didn't, wow, you didn't even know about, you didn't know about Red Mountain Dew and Doritos and Halo 3 and how that was just gaming code.

87
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,540
That's awesome.

88
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,300
It's radical.

89
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,160
Open your gaming juice to take a swig gamers.

90
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
Code red.

91
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,380
Oh, exactly.

92
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:10,800
Code red.

93
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,180
There you go.

94
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,760
See, see.

95
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,420
We, Ms. Smith, we love the red.

96
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,060
dye here.

97
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,420
We love the red dye.

98
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,880
We consume it.

99
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,920
We just embody it.

100
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,960
I wonder what your insides look like.

101
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,440
Really messed up.

102
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,980
Wasn't there something that they had to stop selling because it was turning people's insides like purple or something?

103
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,200
What is it?

104
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,260
Like pretty patties from SpongeBob or something?

105
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,360
They turned my insides purple.

106
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,240
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,440
See, there you go.

108
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,960
See, they were selling pretty patties.

109
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,200
That's what they were doing the whole time.

110
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,460
Yeah.

111
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,400
Probably.

112
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,560
But, Ms. Mitt, we are back aboard the USS Hornet Senior Space Museum.

113
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,940
However, this time, a little bit more.

114
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:14,920
But, but, I will say, the USS Hornet, while has a astounding career behind her in World War II, Korea and Vietnam, She also has an astounding backstory of paranormal activity.

115
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,320
One of the things we do here aboard the ship is our history, mystery investigations.

116
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:25,140
People can come here to stay the night and do overnight ghost tours and investigations with paranormal experts.

117
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:25,920
Wait, overnight!

118
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,900
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,460
You guys are the QR code.

120
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,660
I am not a paranormal expert.

121
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,220
I am simply somebody who has seen some shizz.

122
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,000
Wait, it's okay, I am a paranormal expert.

123

127
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,760
Go, Steve.

128
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,080
I don't know the bit!

129
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,300
Oh, bye!

130
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,180
Bye, Jeff!

131
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,540
Okay, guys, I'm gonna do the tour now.

132
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Oh.

133
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,900
For now.

134
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,360
Yeah, make sure to clip that.

135
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,320
Sorry.

136
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,900
But flying Dutchman and Casper ain't got nothing on Miss Smith, everyone.

137
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,400
It's true.

138
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,280
Yeah.

139
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,020
I didn't know.

140
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,400
But Miss Smith, we're about to go to some areas that you may have seen last time or haven't seen.

141
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,600
But we're going to go to where the highest paranormal activity areas are.

142
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:56,820
Yeah.

143
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,480
Right here.

144
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,020
I'm right here.

145
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,260
I know I got the EMF.

146
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,920
Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.

147
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:04,840
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

148
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:08,820
Okay.

149
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,840
What's that look for?

150
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,320
What are you judging?

151
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,560

Oh, gosh.

154
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,200
Everybody's...

155
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,220
Let's not do that.

156
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,900
Let's not do that.

157
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,100
Otherwise, we're going to see the Rizzler and we're going to see the Costco guys show up.

158
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,480
And the last thing I need is to see the demons of Costco show up here.

159
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,920
Saying like, hey, five big booms.

160
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,360
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

161
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,940
Yeah, that would be actually...

162
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,960
I can't believe there's not like a horror game based off of like them yet.

163
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Like an indie horror game in the distance.

164
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,460
You hear boom, boom.

165
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,180
Five nights at Costco.

166
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,040
Five nights at Costco.

167
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,140
Five booms at Costco.

168
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,420
You're boom, boom, boom, boom.

169
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,080
Boom, boom.

170
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,780
Well, anyways, welcome back, everyone.

171
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,100
Whoa.

172
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,340
It's spooky.

173
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,100
It's dark.

174
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:28,890
It's dark.

175
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,870
All right, Miss Mint, let's start off.

176
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,350
Does anybody have any questions?

177
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,450
We're back in action.

178
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,830
Anybody have any questions about the ship with paranormal activity here?

179
00:14:39,190 --> 00:15:07,830
And I got one ghost story from my own experience that we'll talk about when we get to that location does anyone have any questions that does not revolve around five nights of Freddy's this is not about five nights of Freddy's someone asked if there's any snacks on this tour unfortunately I ate them all because I got big back big back big back big back man my back is loaded up with snacks

180
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,570
Don't make me regret accepting this tour from you.

181
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,570
I think you already have.

182
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,060
I randomly hit up, man.

183
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,660
I'm like, hey, I'm doing all these ghost tours.

184
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,540
I did the tour of Miss Lisa and Pippa.

185
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm like, they're actually asking this minute.

186
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,260
And then she's like, heck yeah, I'm like, are you sure?

187
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,320
You might regret it.

188
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,400
I know.

189
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,320
I feel like you're more on hinge than before.

190
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,860
That was called the influence of the, hey, you influenced me.

191
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,560
You were like the second ever tour that I did here on the ship.

192
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,160
So, you know, it's just all downhill from there.

193
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,240
You were so polite.

194
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,700
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
It's actually what happens to every VTuber.

196
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,300
They start out so polite and so kind and sweet.

197
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,600
And then they just devolve into degeneracy.

198
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,760
Yeah, that's true.

199
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,380
That's true.

200
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,360
Actually, no.

201
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,000
Corrupted.

202
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,960
All right, folks.

203
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,900
We're headed down.

204
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,340
Watch your step.

205
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,780
So, my last...

206
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,100
Let the lights on.

207
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,660
Oh, there we go.

208
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,980
There we go.

209
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,580
That's the sound of the bees.

210
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,120
Oh, yeah.

211
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Oh, bother.

212
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,940
Wait, do you hear that?

213
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,400
What?

214
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:56,180
The ghost of Obear saying, oh, bother, I'm so stuffed with fluff.

215
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm dummy sick.

216
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,740
I don't think he says that ever.

217
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,520
And the sound and the clap of my butt cheeks alerted the bees.

218
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,360
Anyway.

219
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,080
We're crossing memes now.

220
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,640
We're transcending memes.

221
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,060
Yeah.

222
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,780
This is the USS Hornet's channel.

223
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,540
chapels.

224
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,560
This is where different religious ceremonies will be conducted, funerals as such.

225
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:33,540
And if you come here at a certain hour, the 11th hour of the day, sometimes you're called the chapel.

226
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,030
Do you hear it, Chot?

227
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,070
Do you hear it?

228
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Wait, they would do funerals in here?

229
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:56,280
They would do funerals services here or they would do it up on the hangar deck and typically those bodies would be cast out at sea.

230
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:09,030
I like this like Resident Evil POV we're getting.

231
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:11,830
I know.

232
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:15,070
Then again, I'm wearing the midwifery of it.

233
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,130
Wearing the woofah?

234
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,850
Wearing the thick of it, Miss Smith.

235
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,240
we're headed to the cpo mess she's in the opposite mess right

236
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,550

237
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:52,730
all right we're headed into our first haunted area oh my gosh i feel it i feel it

238
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:03,690
ghosts i brought you a ghost to commune with hold on let me give my best way fail.

239
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,350
All right.

240
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,830
I gotta close the door.

241
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,550
Oh, okay.

242
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,310
It doesn't work unless you have complete silence with them.

243
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,730
Or someone.

244
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,790
As quiet as a VTuber can be.

245
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,550
Yop, yop, yop, yop, yop.

246
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,500
Did he freeze?

247
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,920

248
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,200
Oh, there we go.

249
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,500
Can you hear us?

250
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:28,940
Yep.

251
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,380
Spirits.

253
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:33,880

258
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,760
Guys, look at this reputation you've created for yourselves.

259
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,520
So these are foot lockers.

260
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,440
Even to this day sailors, they keep their entire belongings in these lockers.

261
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,360
These are their uniforms, their shoes, personal effects, toothbrush, etc.

262
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,020
Your entire life for almost eight to almost 10 months is in this locker.

263
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:29,460

266
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:48,380
Wow!

267
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,540
There's a mysterious light.

268
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,660
What is that?

269
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,040
What

270
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,280
is that?

271
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,280
Oh, it's an outlet.

272
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh.

273
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,520
Oh, that's handy.

274
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,800
You know, because Ghost got to be able to charge up their phones to play, you know, Azure Lane, Conkale, all that.

275
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,620
Yeah, obviously.

276
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,540
And play League of Legends.

277
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,640
Nope, not doing that.

278
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,500
Oh, sorry, sorry, not League of Legends.

279
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:43,800
Basically, you know, Ghost, they had the power outlets here because they like to play mobile games, especially the top mobile game known as Rage Shadow Legends.

280
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,780
You can use 70 plus champions to be able to play...

281
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,200
Oh, no.

282
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,200
Oh, we lost connection.

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,100

00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:57,850
Okay.

288
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:00,790
So spirits stay there.

289
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,250
Ah, follow us spirits.

290
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,330
Come this way.

291
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,950
Restricted area, huh?

292
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:17,490
How often are like the lights off in this place?

293
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,290
Pretty much all the time.

294
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,130
Oh.

295
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,630
Oh, these are the really old room.

296
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,690
This is...

297
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,450
Oh, be careful.

298
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,760
Oh,

299
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,120
the ghosts come here if it says restricted.

300
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,680
Oh my gosh!

301
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:50,380
Why?

302
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,420
It's a haunted air conditioner!

303
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, God.

304
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,200

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,930
Can't tell you something.

308
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,010
I'm scared right now.

309
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:19,090
Miss Mint.

310
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,710
What?

311
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,090
Dead people.

312
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,620
I feel like you're going to turn a corner and see like a skeleton.

313
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:36,380
I actually feel like I'm watching like a found footage.

314
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:56,920

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,200
I'm looking.

328
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,060
See this question?

329
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,120
Higher visibility.

330
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,760
What is it?

331
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:39,700
Oh.

332
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,160
Someone said, Jeff.

00:26:41,540 --> 00:27:12,720
get evp here ever get what you know what evp is what evp electronic voice phenomenon uh you know there has been some cases of that um i know there have been different apparitions that have appeared and there have been different cases like for example i have a story where i actually heard someone calling my name down below decks and this was when i first came aboard the ship I'm not actually joking this time.

334
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,420
This actually happened.

335
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,640
It freaked me out pretty hard.

336
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,000
That's freaky.

337
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,420
Wait, so nobody was there?

338
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,360
Nope.

339
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,980
How'd they know your name?

340
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,560
They looked at my MySpace page.

341
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,380
Oh, gosh.

342
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,280
You're aging yourself.

343
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,840
I've been six years old, dude.

344
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,480
Come on.

345
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,640
Not the MySpace.

346
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,120
MySpace page.

347
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,320
Hey, you tell me you didn't have the MySpace?

348
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:53,000
You didn't have the MySpace because you're the dark kid with their MySpace and their voice of face.

349
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,680
Would you put me in your top friends or whatever it was called?

350
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,640
I might.

351
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,560
I might.

352
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,300
Woo-hoo!

353
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,520
Yeah, what name did they use?

354
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,320
Jeff or Gibb?

355
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,800
It's flawed.

356
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:11,540
It's flawed.

357
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,640
Yeah, I'm just going to say, my name is Jeff.

358
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,100
We can call the game.

359
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,080
Another restricted area.

360
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,500
I'll venture deeper into the battles.

361
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:27,580
Okay.

362
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,160
We're going in, everybody.

363
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,880
Hold on.

364
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,460
Yeah, what deck are we on?

365
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,340
We are on the fourth deck.

366
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,120
Not many people come down here.

367
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,800
We used to use this area as a classroom, but it was abandoned.

368
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,800
We are staying here.

369
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,320
Yes.

370
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,500
We are all visiting.

371
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,730
There was a face.

372
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,290
What did you guys see?

373
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,010
What is that?

374
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,190
What is that?

375
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,210
Oh.

376
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,530
Oh my gosh.

377
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,810
You know who it is?

378
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,970
Is that your first Sona?

379
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:06,750
My what?

380
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,130
My what?

381
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,510
Your first Sona?

382
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,230
My first Sona?

383
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,890
Oh no.

384
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,730
You know, it's four's over.

385
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:15,670
Bye everyone.

386
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,670
Oh, that's what did it in.

387
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,070
Okay.

388
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,550
I can't tell what it is.

389
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,530
Oh, it's like a- It's an angel demo, clearly.

390
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,270
Oh, I see it now.

391
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,070
Oh, oh, he's so naughty!

392
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,670
Look at his face!

393
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,830
The persona of Austin Powers.

394
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,070
Yeah, yeah, he's doing a great impression.

395
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:40,970
Yeah, baby!

396
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:46,030
Oh my gosh!

397
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,690
Does kind of look like Robbie Rotten.

398
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,270
Robbie Rotten!

399
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,050
We are number one!

400
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,670
We got number one.

401
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:03,950
Oh no.

402
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,450
We triggered something.

403
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:22,190
So if people spend the night here for like ghost tours, are they allowed in these areas or no, because they're still restricted?

404
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:30,350
Well, they go in these areas, but yeah, no longer in use.

405
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,090
Oh.

406
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,290
So immersive.

407
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,150
Get some of the red lights around here.

408
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,010
Oh, Redmond's scary.

409
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,390
Well, it's fine.

410
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,130
I love red.

411
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,250
I love red dye.

412
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,450
I love red taste.

413
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:02,890
We know.

414
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:05,110
Yeah.

415
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,270
Yeah.

416
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

417
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

418
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,040
This really looks like like a FMV of a horror game or something.

419
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,760
It's crazy.

420
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,340
It's a, it's a five foot nighttime phrase, uh, prequel.

421
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,280
Oh my gosh.

422
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,400
The most horrifying place ever.

423
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,480
The dentist.

424
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,450
Oh gosh.

425
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,030
Wait, I haven't gotten my teeth cleaned in so long.

426
00:32:43,030 --> 00:33:08,260
not since i died a fun fact for everybody at home if you go watch very odd parents the dentist is voiced by gilbert godfrey truly horrified oh boy

427
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,760
oh my god what the torture device this

428
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,920
is probably real horror for some of you guys

429
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:49,900
i think because we're deep we're deep in guys sometimes the connection is i feel like i should be putting on some spooky music for some some some ambiance give me a second i'll do that while the while we get the video back let's see spooky bejam

430
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,000
Creepy.

431
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:03,700
Oh.

432
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,720
We're back!

433
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,300
Not gonna lie.

434
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,180
We saw a bunch of human teeth in there.

435
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,340
What?

436
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,660
We missed it!

437
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,100
Yeah, you did.

438
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,520
Because Wi-Fi sucks.

439
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,360
Oh, can you bring us some back for us?

440
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,540
You want me to hold human teeth in my hand?

441
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,760
That's the stuff thing!

442
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,460
Father clean.

443
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:37,090
Nospiratu, can you hear us?

444
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,610
Nospiratu.

445
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,790
This is a model of the USS Essex.

446
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,230
And this meant last time you were here, we talked about how the Hornet is an Essex-class aircraft air.

447
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:01,830
That means it's a sister ship to the USS Essex.

448
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,190
It's the same design.

449
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,090
However, there are a little bit of differences with each iteration of the ships.

450
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,390
But this is what she looked like during World War II.

451
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:11,750
Wow.

452
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:14,370
Wow.

453
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:17,610
Very long.

454
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:18,290
Very long.

455
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:20,470
Wait, no.

456
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,330
You know, I gotta be really careful.

457
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,830
Your clippers are wild.

458
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:26,070
What?

459
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,830
Not really.

460
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:31,590
What?

461
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:32,850
Okay.

462
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,270
We got the buzz going.

463
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:38,450
Alright.

464
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,170
Which way are we going this minute?

465
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,690
Going down this way.

466
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:56,430
the scary hallway scary hallway scary oh see that what was that there's a figure down the hall that way is there

467
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,250

00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,600

469
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,420
yes wait Wait, hold on.

470
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:35,450
I want to save before I go into that room.

471
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,300
Oh gosh, real jump scare.

472
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,400
Welcome to Five Nights at Hornets.

473
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,880
Oh geez.

474
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,320
I didn't sign up for this map.

475
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,440
We just have less pizza.

476
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,640
Ooh, that was the only perk!

477
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:00,840
Ow.

478
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,840
I guess I deserved that.

479
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,160
See, after those are getting back, we need to scare in there.

480
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,000

484
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:17,800

Oh, creepy!

486
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,460
It's the spirit of the postman.

487
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,020
Hang on, wait a minute, Mr. Postman.

488
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:34,820
Is he there?

489
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,260
Is he gonna wave at us?

490
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,940
Wait, Miss Mint, we have to do the chant to summon the ghost of the mailman.

491
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,600
What's that?

492
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,760
You hear that?

493
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:47,620
No?

494
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,100
No.

495
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,340
The ship just started creaking.

496
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,480
Wait, we gotta do the chant.

497
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Ready?

498
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:03,140
Mail call, mail call, mail call, mail call, mail call.

499
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,380
Oh, it's the mail.

500
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,460
I love the mail.

501
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,300
I gotta go and get the mail.

502
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,620
I love to get the mail.

503
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,760
Yeah,

504
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,060
I watched Nickelodeon as a kid.

505
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:50,760

506
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,020
I see.

507
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:57,580
I guess you could say he's stuck in place.

508
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,740
I see.

509
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,160
He's gonna move.

510
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,880
He's gonna move.

511
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,700
He's gonna move.

512
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,920
It happens in every video game.

513
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,600
And video games imitates art imitates real life.

514
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,500
Oh.

515
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,920
Oh, God.

516
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,990
And we're watching.

517
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,890
And we're moving.

518
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:24,870
Turn on.

519
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,070
Oh.

520
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:28,670
Uh oh.

521
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,230
Wait, we lost flashlight?

522
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:32,310
We lost flashlight.

523
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,570
Hold on.

524
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:38,090
You know, ghosts take energy from electronics to feed themselves?

525
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:43,310
Jeez, I didn't think, I did not think the male chant would work.

526
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:47,730
Oh.

527
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:50,590
Okay.

528
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,370
What was that?

529
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,560
I don't think we should go down there.

530
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,700
I don't know if we should.

531
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,640
Actually, we should.

532
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:17,680

00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,640

Oh, Raggy.

539
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,700

546
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,660
Yeah, we just sing the song that mom told me when I'm not trying to be scared.

547
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,640
Uh-huh.

548
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,360
Ready for this?

549
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,040
I'm going on a bear hunt.

550
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:31,500
I'm going on a bear hunt.

551
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,940
I'm going on a bear hunt.

552
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,700
And don't remember that song.

553
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:37,420
Okay, first.

554
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,940
I don't think I know that one.

555
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,540
Yeah, you probably know this one though.

556
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,060
We're on a bear hunt.

557
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,080
the babyhood.

558
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,140
I don't think we don't know how to weed, eat them out.

559
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,840
Oh, I don't think I know that one either.

560
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,410
We never watched the SpongeBob movie.

561
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:56,670
Oh.

562
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:01,450
Oh, I guess I have.

563
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,620
There's a reason it's restricted.

564
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,080
We're going to find out here.

565
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:11,260
Really?

566
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,080
Where were those bumps coming from earlier?

567
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,900
This one's trying to figure out.

568
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:26,740
Oh.

569
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,100
and let me close and stop

570
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:45,840

571
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,860

572
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:02,900
does anyone ever sneak onto the boat no that's Crazy.

573
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,280
Let's let people do that.

574
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,540
Most popular ghost.

575
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,280
Uh, that would be Fred.

576
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:16,400
Fred?

577
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:17,960
Yep.

578
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,140
Are we gonna meet him?

579
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,180
Uh, you know, Fred is probably just hanging around here.

580
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:26,860
We already summoned the male ghost.

581
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:28,040
Yeah.

582
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,100
So we're not the accession.

583
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:31,980
What's what's special about Fred?

584
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:48,040
Fred died at sea no one knows his last name he wanders the holes of a hornet poor guy somebody who discovers his identity

585
00:44:52,300 --> 00:45:04,980
all right this is where I had my paranormal experience before that's pretty freaky Wait, so you heard the voice from down there?

586
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,860
Over, yep, over by the freezing.

587
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,060
When we get to the area, I'll tell you the story, okay?

588
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,260
Whoa, we're going in, everybody.

589
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:24,600
Okay.

590
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:26,960
Okay.

591
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:52,750
how common is it for people to encounter paranormal on the hornet it's pretty common it happens just about every ghost tour that's happened for an investigation oh that's active

592
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:07,110
this is an emergency operating area that leads to the enlisted mess deck so the toe imagine going to get some food while someone's getting surgery.

593
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:07,550
Oh!

594
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,850
That would enhance my appetite.

595
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,890
The scariest thing is the is the fire alarm beeping.

596
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:25,610
This is true.

597
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:27,470
That is the scary, the most horror-filled part.

598
00:46:30,450 --> 00:46:33,190
Oh my gosh, what if we saw a shadow cross at the end of the hallway?

599
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:33,910
Wee!

600
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:37,840
Wait,

601
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,820
why are we first?

602
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,860
Because I'm not going in there alone.

603
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,480
Wait, so you heard your name being called from a place close to where they did surgery?

604
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,660
Very much.

605
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,220
One moment, while I turn this light off.

606
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:10,840
Okay.

607
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,940
To answer your questions while you're waiting.

608
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,190
I'm not trying to smash that button.

609
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,220
So dark.

610
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:25,700
Come on in, this is the machine shop.

611
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,420
This is where they were prepared for questions.

612
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,620
In-house.

613
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,180
Engineers love this area.

614
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:40,400
Who loves this area?

615
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,860
Basically, it's a big tool shop.

616
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:44,200
Engineers.

617
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,960
Oh, of course.

618
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:55,980
now may have people lost a limb or two down here oh yeah probably right a finger

619
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:13,780
man this man you are not scared by a lot of this you are into this you are into this this is this is my thing i was with marisa if you were feeling this this is your thing i should have known you feel right at home while we're in the midst of danger

620
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,210
see some ghosts that come out of the Ark of the Covenant from Indiana Jones.

621
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:26,190
That's gonna be wild, man.

622
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,590
Oh, that would be crazy.

623
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:32,510
Nah, listen, man.

624
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:34,510
Indiana Jones used to scare me when I was a kid.

625
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:39,870
I was scared of Indiana Jones movies so much that Lego Indiana Jones freaked me out.

626
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,170
No way.

627
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:42,830
That's supposed to be...

628
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,210
I was a kid and I watched Temple of Doom.

629
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:48,390
Okay, I can understand that.

630
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:49,990
That movie would freak me out too.

631
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,110
I was traumatized.

632
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:56,510
But you know, there's a lot of stuff that didn't freak me out as much.

633
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:02,010
The ending of that, the whole movie is fine until the end, I think.

634
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,490
I think the end was really that shock horror.

635
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,440
Wow, so shiny.

636
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,600
This is the enlisted Vestek.

637
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:20,290
This is where sailors will come and get Chow while the road...

638
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:21,560
Watch.

639
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:23,920
I remember this area, I think.

640
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,860
Yeah, I think we saw it last time.

641
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,060
Alrighty, we're entering the area the incident happened.

642
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:38,780
Congrats, I'm relieving my trauma for mental content.

643
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,160
Yay!

644
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,460
Yippee!

645
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:50,040
All right.

646
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,320
Freezer.

647
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:58,340
So, when I first came aboard the ship, my boss wanted me to come down here to the freezer and get a flat of water she was keeping here.

648
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:28,660
now this was just the storage area doesn't work anymore but keeps it relatively cool since it's down below debt now I come down here I wander around to a bit and I find myself here you don't know where all the light switches are so it's dark get the key undoing the lock okay let me get inside then I hear Gabe and I look over to my right I don't see anything I'm like um so I'm like hey Izzy is that you I look back and there's an over-the-distance where that doors,

649
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:29,700
there's a shrouded figure.

650
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,340
So I go back to my tank and I'm just like, hey, who's that?

651
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,560
I'm like, okay, geez, so I look around again, it's not there.

652
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,060
I walk in the theater and there's a freezer.

653
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,660
I open it up, get the waters, right?

654
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:48,320
A lot of waters.

655
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,860
I got it.

656
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,580
It's a long guy.

657
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:55,520
I look back, the figures are a little closer to where those soap hangers are.

658
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,200
I'm like, Okay, I'm gonna go.

659
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,140
Turn the corner over here.

660
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,420
I look back.

661
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,420
It's gone.

662
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,440
I turn up the corner again, I go in this room.

663
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,120
As soon as I enter this room, I hear, Dave.

664
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,060
And then I look back.

665
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,160
Nothing was there.

666
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,880
And to this day, I still don't know what that situation was, but I do know.

667
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:38,660
not come down to the mess deck unless you got somebody with you oh i got chills creepy

668
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:59,950
how long ago was this so it was four years ago when i first came aboard four years haven't had that experience since but hadn't had some other things other things

669
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:14,410
Someone said, now I get why my grandfather didn't talk about his time on the USS Hornet.

670
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:19,450
Oh, that's just because his favorite t-shirt was in the stock.

671
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:20,330
It is.

672
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:20,510
Oh.

673
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:27,590
Do you have any other staff member ghost experiences?

674
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:36,470
One staff member, a turner of a cult story, had an experience with an apparition.

675
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,250
A full apparition.

676
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:46,290
He was just at the mall, and he said, saw an apparition appear or that's

677
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:25,880
all that is all i really know oh no i'm anti-climactic but he just said he saw a guy in full dress uniform he had a lucid conversation a uniform a uniform yep full dressed white uniform oh this is the dishwasher even Oh gosh, chores are so scary.

678
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:40,930
Oh, you see something?

679
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:45,310
It just turned on.

680
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,460
Spirits, if you can hear us, we mean you no harm.

681
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,420
We are only visiting.

682
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:57,450
I mean harm.

683
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:00,310
Oh my god.

684
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:05,830
We don't see Mike, but she's like in the ghosty dimension right now.

685
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:06,430
We're here.

686
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:07,370
We're in risk.

687
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,430
Demons, come possess me.

688
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:14,450
Bees mischief.

689
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,710
Demons, scratch Gabe.

690
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:19,490
Huh?

691
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:21,930
Scratch me.

692
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:24,930
Because that's what they do.

693
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,290
I don't want to be scratched.

694
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,890
Unless it's cat scratch.

695
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,330
You could take it.

696
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,250
I get, I get, you're a cat scratch.

697
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,250
You don't know what cat scratch is, search it up on YouTube.

698
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,290
Catch, cat, cat scratch.

699
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,170

00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,490
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

701
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:45,730
Cat scratch.

702
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:48,870
It's George Poplin, Mr. Blink, and I.

703
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,580
We're headed to our next part.

704
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,840
Let's go!

705
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,580
Haunted Bakery.

706
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:05,400
Ooh, yummy.

707
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,460
We got some extra thick ghosts in there.

708
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:11,140
I was going to say...

709
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:11,840
I was going to say...

710
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,100
Some people call me the haunted bakery.

711
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:18,840
Why?

712
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,680
Keep going.

713
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,220
I'm excited.

714
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:29,930
Okay, okay.

715
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:31,430
Nobody's ever called me that.

716
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,870
Oh my gosh.

717
00:55:37,350 --> 00:55:43,290
This tour is going in a direction that I don't think my boss will be too crowded before.

718
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:48,690
Sorry, camera person, for having to hear all of this.

719
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:50,430
It's okay.

720
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,550
You've done worse.

721
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:09,970
Guys, if you see any anomaly, say something.

722
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:13,750
Spirits, can you hear us?

723
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,050
Yes.

724
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,330
What are you baking in here?

725
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:22,620
Ooh, bread.

726
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,050
Oh, wow, bread.

727
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,350
There's Skelly in there?

728
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:33,710
There's Skelly in there.

729
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,820
Oh my god.

730
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,620
Get out of the way.

731
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,200
Get out of the way.

732
00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:57,590
And everyone died.

733
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,370
You died.

734
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:02,930
Oh man.

735
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:06,170
Okay.

736
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:08,610
Okay.

737
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,130
You see, look, that actually is some of the spirits, because now my other flashlight's out there.

738
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:13,850
Oh, wait, never mind.

739
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:14,730
Oh, okay.

740
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,990
This is why we bring the spare, Mendoza.

741
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:20,210
This is why we bring the spare.

742
00:57:23,950 --> 00:57:24,970
Ghosty, I got a question.

743
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:26,130
Mm-hmm.

744
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,810
What is your favorite place to haunt?

745
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,470
Like, if you guys pick, why are you haunted?

746
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:38,450
Um, I like to haunt people's homes because it's always stocked with food.

747
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:42,990
Are you raiding people's fridges like that?

748
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:43,750
That's crazy.

749
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,590
Yeah, yeah.

750
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,910
I tend to do that.

751
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,630
If you steal on the Capri Suns?

752
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:55,610
If they have any, I definitely would take a Capri Sun.

753
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:58,670
I would too.

754
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,250
Wow, this area is so spooky looking.

755
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,480
Alright.

756
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,900
Welcome to the haunted sick bay.

757
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:10,320
Oh, it's the metal burner.

758
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:43,790
this is definitely where people have died oh whoa I go on with the flashlight on or just the red light just the red light actually the flashlight on in case we see something that's a great start here this is so scary I feel like you know how you have like other game devs coming here you need to have a horror game game devs come too.

759
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,810
Bring a phasmophobia or something?

760
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:52,010
Okay, that just turned off without me.

761
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,250
Oh my gosh!

762
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,750
Flashlights are really acting weird.

763
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:09,870
Yeah, my flashlights are acting up right now.

764
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,590
Dave, I told you this was the area that had the most activity gone.

765
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:27,590
Yeah, honestly, we just...

766
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:30,610
We got in here and suddenly flashlights started going crazy.

767
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:36,290
Uh-oh.

768
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,920
Crazy hop.

769
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:50,580
Uh-oh.

770
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,500
Oh my god!

771
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,340
I'm not even doing anything.

772
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,060
Yeah.

773
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:56,520
See?

774
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm not even doing anything.

775
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:04,210
Whoa.

776
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,240
Even just the tools alone make it look so spooky.

777
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,110
It's Can you hear us?

778
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,430
Trick or treat.

779
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,110
Trick, smell my food.

780
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:27,430
Give me something.

781
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,630
If you don't, I don't care.

782
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:34,310
I'll pull down your underwear.

783
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,790
Is there any spirits living here still?

784
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:55,870
Hello, it's me and Minto.

785
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,730
I'm a ghost too.

786
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:00,930
Good morning.

787
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:04,470
Did you hear that?

788
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:05,410
Wait, what's that?

789
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,390
Sounds like uncle.

790
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:08,870
It's uncle grandpa.

791
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:10,830
It was uncle grandpa, right?

792
01:01:11,690 --> 01:01:13,950
Uncle grandpa, can you hear us?

793
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:15,350
Hey, what's going on?

794
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,030
Good morning, Minto.

795
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:18,110
Good morning, Minto.

796
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:19,850
No bad morning, Minto.

797
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:22,790
You watch Minto streams.

798
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:25,070
Yeah, do.

799
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:27,490
This is great.

800
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,910
This is like the most EVP I've ever heard.

801
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:37,450
Uncle Grandpa, are you having a good day today?

802
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:39,830
Bad moment.

803
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:43,770

819
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:42,940
They're not theater kids.

They know.

01:03:49,590 --> 01:03:51,290
Well, that's not creepy at all.

824
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:53,690
I didn't leave that door open.

825
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:57,760
Whoa!

826
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:07,750
Wait, actually?

Someone else?

829
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:30,200

01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:47,820
And let's quietly go up the stairs.

846
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,320
I thought you were saying hi because you were like, is anyone here?

847
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,240
I didn't turn on that light.

848
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:13,140
What?

849
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:20,900
Why is it getting so crazy?

850
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:22,280
Why is it getting so crazy?

851
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,240
This is the most intense tour I've done thus far.

852
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,380
The other ones, I was like, oh yeah, it's cool.

853
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:28,960
I'm in control.

854

Oh my gosh.

858
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:55,480
Well, Miss Mint, if you will give my eulogy at my funeral, I would appreciate it.

859

Yeah, I'll be fine.

860
01:06:59,060 --> 01:06:59,920
He lived as he died.

861
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:01,920
Definite.

862
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,320
I was a simple Jeff and I died a simple Jeff.

863
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,840
Are any questions people have?

864
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,860

I'm waiting.

867
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,830
People are just doing 07.

01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:45,850

Oh, Mr. Cartwright?

871
01:07:50,250 --> 01:07:52,050
Well, he's not a ghost yet.

872
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:53,530
Oh, what the hell?

873
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,150
Why would you ask that?

874
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:58,570
Mr. Cartwright, you were kidding.

875
01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:02,970
Here, I thought it was a ghost.

876
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:05,150
It's just an old man.

877
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:36,990

01:08:38,490 --> 01:08:41,970
And I don't think I can answer this question because you know what, Miss Mint.

880
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:44,170
They will kill me.

881
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:44,450
Oh.

882
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,750
I love all jet girls equally.

883
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:51,450
You know that is my favorite above another.

884
01:08:52,230 --> 01:08:55,050
There are many jets, but I like them all the same.

885
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:56,390
See?

886
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,210
Guys?

887
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:01,530
There, if...

888
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:02,030
If...

889
01:09:02,030 --> 01:09:02,350
If...

890
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:03,990
That's the safest answer possible.

891
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:05,110
Yeah, I think so.

892
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:07,130
You would get in trouble.

893
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,170
Spoken like a true manager.

894
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,890
Look, we love our jet girls.

895
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:13,830
There we go.

896
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:14,290
Ah.

897
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:20,730

898
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:23,770
Actually, we rebranded.

899
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,410
Yeah.

900
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:26,730

901
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:27,330

01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:30,830

904
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:32,550
Oh.

905
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:34,270
I don't know how it happened.

906
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:35,770
But they did it.

907
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:36,830

910
01:10:01,050 --> 01:10:02,490
Hi, Miss June.

911
01:10:03,850 --> 01:10:05,210
Hi, Miss June.

912
01:10:06,130 --> 01:10:06,930
Would you see you again?

913
01:10:06,990 --> 01:10:07,990
I brought Minto back.

914
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,750
Yep.

915
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:12,090
I'm here to kiss you on the lips.

916
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,330
Yeah, you love kissing the hacks on the lips, don't you?

917
01:10:16,730 --> 01:10:16,890
Yes.

918
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:22,110
Tari, if you can hear this, she just confirmed it.

919
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:25,970
That'll scare away any ghosts.

920
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:30,550
Yeah, ghosts are deathly afraid of Yuri.

921
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,610
Oh my gosh, I'm Yuri Manga!

922
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,230
Stay away, stay away!

923
01:10:38,290 --> 01:10:39,890
Oh my god, that guy there scared them.

924
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:42,210
That scared me so bad.

925
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:49,070
Oh, that's just really sharp.

926
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:50,230
Spooked me.

927
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,230
Okay.

928
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:57,550
All right, since you've been here, Miss Smith, it's just a little thing here.

929
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,550
This is our newest aircraft to our collection.

930
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:02,410
This is the F-A-18C.

931
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:03,250
So this is Faye.

932
01:11:03,470 --> 01:11:04,570
Well, this is Faye's cousin.

933
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:10,970
This aircraft is famous because it scored a mid-kill during the Persian Gulf War, one of the only aircraft to do so.

934
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:11,930
Wow!

935
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:14,050
Yep.

936
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:16,730
This was recently donated to the museum.

937
01:11:17,330 --> 01:11:20,210
We are going to begin restoring her to a private commission.

938
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,190
Wow!

939
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:22,710
Wow!

940
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:25,890
Pretty.

941
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,640
Are there any questions before we enter it?

942
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,500
Any questions again guys?

943
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,100
Feel free to always ask questions.

944
01:11:46,200 --> 01:11:48,260
I'll try to ask when I can.

945
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:55,030
Spooky.

946
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:56,310
Spooky hallway.

947
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:59,270
Come on, let's go.

948
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:08,690

950
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:30,480
Oh.

951
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,260
Why is the floor sticky?

952
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:34,040
Ew.

953
01:12:36,740 --> 01:12:38,880
This could be ectoplasm, you think?

954
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:39,780
It could be.

955
01:12:39,820 --> 01:12:41,120
Sorry, I'm dripping a little.

956
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:46,600
I'll mop it up.

957
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:47,760
Oh my gosh.

958
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,080
Sorry.

959
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:52,160
Sorry.

960
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,660
It's like sweat.

961
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,500
It's natural.

962
01:12:57,760 --> 01:12:58,060
What?

963
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:04,340
I'm a ghost!

964
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,600
I can't do this man, I can't do it.

965
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:18,060
Lord Jesus, please forgive me.

966
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:24,260
Oh God, if you're a man, this mittel, but dear God.

967
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,300
My bad.

968
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,140
Thanks for the raid!

969
01:13:32,980 --> 01:13:33,200
What?

970
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,960
The actual fudge!

971
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,620
Oh my gosh.

972
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,020
I'm so sorry.

973
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,640
It's just ghost things.

974
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,040
Just ghosty things, you know?

975
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,500
I don't want to know about that.

976
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,500
I don't want to know what ghost be doing.

977
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:53,560
I don't want to know about what they're doing or whatever.

978
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:54,720
My bad.

979
01:13:54,980 --> 01:13:56,960
I'll keep that to myself from now on.

980
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:58,580
Oh my gosh!

981
01:13:59,060 --> 01:13:59,380
What?

982
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:05,570
I'm scared of women.

983
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,290
Scared of girls!

984
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:08,630
Don't be...

985
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:11,030
Actually, I'm kind of scared of women too.

986
01:14:11,450 --> 01:14:12,870
I'm scared of girls.

987
01:14:13,610 --> 01:14:14,310
Oh, I'm blocking.

988
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,170
My head's blocking it.

989
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,630
Sorry guys.

990
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,860
Got that lovely buzzing sound.

991
01:14:23,220 --> 01:14:24,020
Alright, here we are.

992
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:24,760
Generators.

993
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:37,020
Are there any women ghosts here that we can run away from?

994
01:14:38,040 --> 01:14:38,440
Hi.

995
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:41,880
Oh wait, yep, right, I forgot.

996
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:55,970
Did it always have a lady's bathroom or is that like a like a newer addition?

997
01:14:58,350 --> 01:15:00,230
We have to be a museum, Ms. Mitchell.

998
01:15:09,530 --> 01:15:10,010
Do

999
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:18,870
you have any ghosts that are like, you know, well known to like the team?

1000
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:21,330
Like they have they have names?

1001
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,510
Besides Fred, I guess?

1002
01:15:24,330 --> 01:15:25,270
I told you about Fred.

1003
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:29,090
Maybe that's what we saw when we were on the back part of the ship.

1004
01:15:29,270 --> 01:15:29,610
Oh!

1005
01:15:31,950 --> 01:15:35,710
He was like, Do you know who I am?

1006
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,770
Oh my gosh, please don't.

1007
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:38,730
Please don't do that.

1008
01:15:42,150 --> 01:15:46,650
You're at home right now in your computer, and we are in the thick city.

1009
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:50,150
If I die, you better write a nice apology letter to my mother.

1010
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,010
No!

1011
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:53,150
You'll be fine.

1012
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:01,060
Remember this room?

1013
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,090
This is where we summon the spirit bomb.

1014
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:07,820
Ooh.

1015
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:09,980
It looks big.

1016
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:10,940
Wait, what is this room?

1017
01:16:11,940 --> 01:16:13,070
It's an angel room.

1018
01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:14,200
Oh.

1019
01:16:25,550 --> 01:16:27,510
Spirit, are you here?

1020
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:32,990
Fred?

1021
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:34,570
Fred?

1022
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,810
They're not followed us.

1023
01:16:37,490 --> 01:16:41,090
This is Jeff.

1024
01:16:41,870 --> 01:16:42,910
I need you no more.

1025
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,830
Simply want to exploit you for content on the internet.

1026
01:17:00,050 --> 01:17:03,170
Someone asked, what makes a good haunted ship ghost?

1027
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:07,810
Like, do you need to be military or be watery?

1028
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:12,470
Yeah, what is a good, like, what's your ideal haunted ship ghost?

1029
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:14,610
I don't think I have an idea.

1030
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:25,010
I think I don't want to see no ghost, but I think I would say it's got to be some it's got to be somebody who has some sort of relation to the ship right

1031
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:49,210
are we the only ones on the ship today right now the only two people on the ship right at this very moment oh camera name wow

Oh.

1040
01:18:54,090 --> 01:18:55,910
I don't think I can fit in there, Miss Minto.

1041
01:18:57,870 --> 01:18:59,050
I'm a little too big.

1042
01:18:59,850 --> 01:19:02,290
How often are you hitting your head on these ceilings?

1043
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:06,690
Well, I can't remember my birthday, so that should tell you.

1044

Yeah, that answers it.

1045
01:19:11,390 --> 01:19:12,830

01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,540
I'm going home.

1059
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,180
You guys, I'm going home.

1060
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:11,580
Y'all talk about spitting on people?

1061
01:22:12,780 --> 01:22:14,300
Your mama's told you don't spit on people.

1062
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:16,620
I think V-feet would want to do that.

1063
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:21,200
You know what the really sad part is, Miss Minto?

1064
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:21,920
What?

1065
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,280
More than likely, yes.

1066
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,200
More than likely.

1067
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,540
Yeah, I think so.

1068
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:44,540
serious blue light yeah what is that

1069
01:22:48,340 --> 01:23:32,260
didn't you watch finding Nemo you don't go moving towards the blue light well actually I'm a ghost so I also shouldn't be going towards the light unless I want to you know yeah probably not someone asked is a true 300 people have passed away on the hornet yes it is that's a lot of people a lot of souls still hanging around still on duty yeah 300 ghosts it's crowded in here they having a ghost brave.

1070
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:34,880
Now,

1071
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,220
you know what they're dancing to Ms. Smith?

1072
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,860
First I was afraid.

1073
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,060
I was petrified.

1074
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:49,780
I'm thinking I could never leave one by my side.

1075
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:53,960
But then I spent so many nights thinking how I grew.

1076
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,240
And I grew strong.

1077
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:00,300
And I learned how to get along and now you're back.

1078
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:06,940
From my space, I walk right here with that said look upon your face.

1079
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:08,800
I should have changed as you were left.

1080
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:10,820
I should have known the way to keep.

1081
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,500
If I had known for just one second, you'd be back to follow me.

1082
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,720
Now, now, now, go.

1083
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:17,600
Walk out the door.

1084
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,140
Just aren't around now.

1085
01:24:20,860 --> 01:24:22,480
You're not welcome anymore.

1086
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,220
Aren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?

1087
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,580
You thought I'd crumble.

1088
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,140
Oh, now I lay down now.

1089
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:32,980
I will survive.

1090
01:24:34,220 --> 01:24:38,360
Oh, if I come on, how to love, I know I will survive.

1091
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,520
And if I get all my life to give, I got all my love to give.

1092
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:43,800
Now I'll survive.

1093
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:45,960
I will survive.

1094
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:47,260
Yay!

1095
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:50,940
Yay!

1096
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:02,160
Well, I'll take it.

1097
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:04,420
Any questions, you laden?

1098
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,200
Any questions, anybody?

1099
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,420
Free concert.

1100
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:16,560
Any weddings?

1101
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,160
On the ship?

1102
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:27,500
We do open up the ship for weddings, so people have gotten married here because we do act as a venue for different events, you know.

1103
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:32,360
We do events like Kyrgyzstan, but like sometimes people like to rent us out for weddings, parties.

1104
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:33,760
Matter of fact, there was a furry.

1105
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:37,040
convention here, so we do just about everything.

1106
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:38,420
Oh, furry convention!

1107
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,080
So it was your first show, and uh...

1108
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:47,650
Someone asked, what's the weirdest story you've ever heard?

1109
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,670
It doesn't have to be paranormal, just weird.

1110
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:53,150
Uh...

1111
01:25:53,150 --> 01:25:53,910
Cool.

1112
01:25:56,290 --> 01:25:59,190
I think the weirdest story I've heard

1113
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,630
was...

1114
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,290
Was...

1115
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:07,770
Was when someone came aboard the ship and they lost their badge.

1116
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:12,890
And a tradition they have aboard here is if you come aboard the ship and you're a staffer, voluntary, don't have their badge.

1117
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:15,090
They give you a replacement badge, but you know where it is?

1118
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:16,070
Where?

1119
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:19,670
A guy with a paper bag on his head saying SS dummy.

1120
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:20,510
Oh!

1121
01:26:22,250 --> 01:26:23,430
And I'm like, that's a...

1122
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:24,030
You do that.

1123
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:24,550
It's weird.

1124
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:32,420
The second weirdest thing is when I became a staff member, that was pretty weird.

1125
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,620
It was all downhill from there.

1126
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,540
Oh, yeah, I believe that.

1127
01:26:36,740 --> 01:27:36,520
now you got you got furry conventions and anime conventions on here can you imagine what an anime convention like aircraft carrier yeah guys have you guys heard of carrier con 2026 baby but anyways miss met hack concludes the ghost tour we went about to every haunted area in the ship cover a lot of ground we lost our minds to brain rot so you know it was a good stream are there any questions any last questions you guys any last questions this was the death game for a limited time only like buzz light here here for here one moment but i'm not here for infinity but i'll be here for beyond oh gosh wait people are asking so many things hold on um oh someone said which ship do you think is more haunted the uss hornet or uss yorktown Ooh,

1128
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:37,560
that's a good one.

1129
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:44,380
So the newest, Yorktown is very haunted, definitely has its own stories.

1130
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,480
The Hornet has a lot of its own stories as well.

1131
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,480
The Hornet is as she is when she was decommissioned in 1970.

1132
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,220
Yorktown had a little bit of changes to her.

1133
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:58,400
So if we're talking about who has more paranormal activity, I would say it's very, very close.

1134
01:27:58,860 --> 01:28:03,780
What I say the Hornet is probably more authentic, so you're going to see probably undisturbed wrestling places.

1135
01:28:04,060 --> 01:28:04,700
Probably so.

1136
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:10,200
But, you know, not trying to be biased or anything, but just, you know, the same.

1137
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,140
But love the Usset Yard town.

1138
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,880
They have a wonderful crew, and they do their own ghost tours as well.

1139
01:28:15,020 --> 01:28:16,820
So make sure to go support them, guys, if you're on the East Coast.

1140
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:18,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1141
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:20,840
Let's see.

1142
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:23,320
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1143
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,340
Um, someone asked, how is V-Fleet going?

1144
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:30,540
Anything you want to hype up?

1145
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,600
Beefly, it's going really well, guys.

1146
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:36,720
Thank you very much.

1147
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:41,720
Girls, you know, we've had new talents come, and it's been really great.

1148
01:28:41,860 --> 01:28:42,600
It's been a lot of fun.

1149
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:51,640
And we're taking such a big stride in that we're actually producing our first ever IRL concert, similar to off-season live Miss Smith, called Boat Goes Vincent.

1150
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:54,320
I'm dead serious with you.

1151
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:55,180
That is the ripple.

1152
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:56,420
Dead.

1153
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:00,340
But we're producing our own first concert.

1154
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:04,700
It's going to be held at the USS Iowa Museum in San Pedro, California.

1155
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:07,600
It's actually going to be a fundraiser for the USS Iowa.

1156
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:13,340
We're doing in collaboration with the museum, and your ticket, 100% of the proceeds, are going to the USS Iowa.

1157
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:16,420
Iowa will be doing the ticketing, so it's going straight to them.

1158
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,820
And your ticket counts as a donation.

1159
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,800
So that's something really cool that you could do.

1160
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:22,720
Off your taxes, saying.

1161
01:29:24,460 --> 01:29:26,760
We're excited to be collaborating with the USS Iowa.

1162
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,340
They have a wonderful crew down there.

1163
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:30,140
It's going to be over ALA weekend.

1164
01:29:30,540 --> 01:30:39,680
Los Angeles so on feel free to come by it's gonna be a great concert can't talk about the lineup just yet can't do that otherwise some of the staff who are watching your stream right now are going to kill me in discord afterwards so but I will say it is very very high and you know obviously on the hornet side we're gearing up for a lot of great events coming up we have our New Year's Eve the gallop that's coming up here what's that uh that is well it's new year's evening this minute yeah it would be January 31st right right sorry it would be December to see I'm messing up on days off see this is the ghosty brain rot that's consuming me right now yeah yeah it's okay you had a busy night hey that minty brain rot is contagious man it's contagious contagious like a disease it's a virus it's a virus but we're going viral oh subscribe like and comment on the video well we got some cool stuff coming here up where the ship carrier con 2026 in case you guys didn't see it's actually two days now

1165
01:30:39,680 --> 01:30:53,460
we're going from march 20 uh well march 21st and 22nd but ocean on deck the concert we have will be on the 20th can't talk about that just yet really can't talk I really want to talk about it, huh?

1166
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:57,080
Huh, man, huh, those people really want to talk about it.

1167
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,560
But we can't just yet.

1168
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,660
But a lot of great stuff is happening.

1169
01:31:00,980 --> 01:31:13,840
And this year's fundraiser is going to be amazing because we're raising money to increase the Hornets accessibility, new ADA accessibility, repairs to our brows, but also elevators to help get people to, especially with wheelchair accessibility.

1170
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,760
So if you've been in the Hornet, you know it's very historical.

1171
01:31:16,860 --> 01:31:18,100
We have to build around it.

1172
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,420
So we are looking at different ways to make the ship more accessible.

1173
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:53,600
uh your ticket this year and obviously any donations you do or contributions will go towards making the ship more accessible for future generations to come so that's what we're doing there beefly's doing well um and again we all appreciate you guys to support very much about these museums folks i can't never tell you enough these places are magical um obviously a little scary a little scary but that's part of the charm right yeah i can't believe we got so like the the flashlights and And then we saw that thing down the hall.

1174
01:31:53,860 --> 01:31:56,000
I know, I had, like, two flashlights the whole time.

1175
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:58,360
I was thinking, well, I mean, it kept turning on.

1176
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:00,340
So it tells me, hey, that's the experience.

1177
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,460
Ghosts passing.

1178
01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:04,540
Freaky.

1179
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,020
Sorry, it caused such a disruption.

1180
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:08,900
I know.

1181
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:12,040
Hey, that's the most paranormal activities happened with you thus far.

1182
01:32:12,380 --> 01:32:13,260
So just saying.

1183
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:13,560
Let's go.

1184
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:14,040
Oh, yeah.

1185
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,940
There was also, like, the banging and everything.

1186
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:16,300
Wow.

1187
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:17,040
What was going on?

1188
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:17,920
We saw Fred.

1189
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:18,580
We saw Fred.

1190
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:19,200
We saw Fred.

1191
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,160
Yeah.

1192
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:21,680

Oh.

1196
01:33:24,340 --> 01:33:24,620
I don't know.

1197
01:33:24,740 --> 01:33:25,920
Uncle Grandpa might have gotten killed.

1198
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:26,840
Put longer is crazy.

1199
01:33:27,100 --> 01:33:27,940
I mean, who knows?

1200
01:33:29,940 --> 01:33:31,760
But anyways, are there any other questions?

1201
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:34,940
Any last questions, you guys?

1202
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:37,380
Any last questions?

1203
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:39,000
I thought I'd get to deathgate for a minute.

1204
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,140
So let's go see if he wants to be back.

1205
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:49,840
People are saying thanks for the tour.

1206
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,740
Is Fred Haas style?

It'll just say Metal Gear.

1218
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:53,440
No, I'll just say no.

1219
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:57,740
It'll be like a really, really well-illustrated though.

1220
01:35:57,900 --> 01:35:58,640
Yeah, okay.

1221
01:35:59,140 --> 01:36:00,060
Yes, exactly.

1222
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,260
Well, thank you again for the ghost tour.

1223
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,120
This was so spooky and fun.

1224
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,340
Absolutely.

1225
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,180
Yeah, I really appreciate you taking me out again.

1226
01:36:11,160 --> 01:36:12,160
And my chat, too.

1227
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,840
This meant it's always a pleasure.

1228
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:15,900
It's always wonderful.

1229
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,520
We love having you here aboard the ship.

1230
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:19,480
We're such a great supporter.

1231
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:21,440
We're very grateful to you here at the museum.

1232
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:24,240
I personally, very grateful to you.

1233
01:36:24,540 --> 01:36:29,320
You know, along with Miss Lisa, you were the second tour that I had given here aboard the ship.

1234
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:33,860
It's really blessed my life in the sense that I love showing new people the ship.

1235
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,940
You know, the VTuber tour has been really great.

1236
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:37,960
You know, everybody can appreciate this place.

1237
01:36:38,120 --> 01:36:46,680
And so I'm very glad I've been able to help contribute to keeping the ship's legacy alive, but also at the same time, helping people like you learn a little bit about this place and learn about the people behind it.

1238
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:47,980
So, you know, thank you very much.

1239
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:48,960
Blessing my life.

1240
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,500
I very much appreciate you for that.

1241
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,540
And, you know, it's been great.

1242
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:52,900
Thank you.

1243
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:54,920
Tell Miss Debbie I said hi.

1244
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:57,440
I will tell Miss Debbie you said hello.

1245
01:36:57,460 --> 01:36:58,260
I will tell Miss Debbie.

1246
01:36:58,320 --> 01:36:59,100
That's the thing, folks.

1247
01:36:59,200 --> 01:36:59,920
You guys come to the museum.

1248
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:00,800
Ask for Miss Debbie.

1249
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:01,800
Learn her story.

1250
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:04,460
She's a great lady here aboard the ship.

1251
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:05,660
Father was on the ship.

1252
01:37:06,340 --> 01:37:08,120
And she does a lot of restoration work.

1253
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:09,120
Kind old lady.

1254
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:10,480
And she is amazing.

1255
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,360
So make sure to ask Miss Debbie.

1256
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:12,900
Yeah.

1257
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:14,540
Thank you, Jeff.

1258
01:37:14,540 --> 01:37:15,040
That's it.

1259
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:16,040
Thank you.

1260
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:16,600
All right, folks.

1261
01:37:16,980 --> 01:37:17,960
We'll catch you later, okay?

1262
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:18,480
Okay.

1263
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:19,340
Bye-bye.

1264
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,460
that's me

1265
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:47,900
yay whoa oh you know I expected spooky but I didn't expect like the banging was so scary and like what I was freaky and if he really didn't say hi who did

1266
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:51,940
the area with the red light was so cool it was i want to i want to go do a ghost tour for real on the ship i want to go i want to go i will someday i wish that i think the only thing is i wish so you didn't see the face was it not the was it not the devil thing that he showed us it wasn't that I think the only thing that I wish was you know obviously this is not Gabe's fault but the discord noise you know what's the word noise canceling nah we were gaslighting Oh,

1267
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,500
hey, good fan of ship tours and ghost tours.

1268
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:58,040
Thank you, Vinto.

1269
01:38:58,340 --> 01:38:58,680
Of course.

1270
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:04,400
Yeah, if only we didn't have the noise canceling so that it could be like we could hear more, you know?

1271
01:39:04,660 --> 01:39:05,460
It's a great tradition.

1272
01:39:05,620 --> 01:39:06,280
Please keep doing it.

1273
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,000
Of course.

1274
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,740
Maybe one day it could be me, you know?

1275
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:25,780
I could be the one walking around and with my camera and everything so that whatever is going on, caught, then you guys hear it too and everything.

1276
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:28,980
And then I wouldn't be scared, maybe.

1277
01:39:31,860 --> 01:39:32,340
Maybe.

1278
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,320
Marco, thank you so much for the gifted.

1279
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:36,760
Thank you guys so much for all the donos and the gifted.

1280
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:39,900
And I saw somebody raided and everybody donated a lot.

1281
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,620
I didn't want to distract so much from Jeff Gabe talking.

1282
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:49,380
So, um, you would definitely be scared.

1283
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:50,900
No, I wouldn't.

1284
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:55,000
No, I'm...

1285
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,740
Thanks for the fun Tormento.

1286
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:03,360
Thank you.

1287
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:04,040
Thank you.

1288
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:04,600
Thank you.

1289
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:06,240
That was so much fun.

1290
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:08,880
Sorry, is his name Jeff or Gabe?

1291
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:09,800
That's a great question.

1292
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:10,820
So last time... What?

1293
01:40:11,300 --> 01:40:12,840
Everybody start calling him Jeff.

1294
01:40:14,180 --> 01:40:16,860
I think he made a joke about being named Jeff.

1295
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,960
And everyone thought his name was Jeff.

1296
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:20,800
And then he was just like...

1297
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:22,260
No, my name's actually Gabe.

1298
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:23,420
Okay.

1299
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,540
He said, hi.

1300
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:30,520
My name is Jeff, ma'am.

1301
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:33,660
He introduced himself as Jeff.

1302
01:40:36,460 --> 01:40:37,660
So it was that.

1303
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:39,720
But no, his name is Gib.

1304
01:40:40,520 --> 01:40:41,860
But we call him Jeff Gib.

1305
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,020
Or Gib.

1306
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:44,240
Or, no, not Gib.

1307
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:45,100
We call him Jeff.

1308
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:47,160
Surely Minto won't be scared.

1309
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:48,940
Thank you for the fun Tori Minto.

1310
01:40:49,300 --> 01:40:50,160
Is Jeff single?

1311
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,460
I think he answered this last time too.

1312
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,200
Wait, but it's been a year.

1313
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:26,560
again for you guys sorry but you could always go to the hornet try not to harass him too much there's also carrier con bivikor thanks for that five gift and thank you you could always be like is there a jeff aka gabe around here and then and then you know ask him you know you should I shouldn't just say,

1314
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:27,500
like, hey, are you single?

1315
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:31,280
You should, like, kind of rizze him up a little.

1316
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:38,540
I cannot believe nobody has made a five booms at Costco yet.

1317
01:41:40,620 --> 01:41:42,820
That's been in my brain this whole time.

1318
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:44,240
Five booms at Costco.

1319
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,440
I can't.

1320
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:48,640
How has that not been done yet?

1321
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,220
Synapse!

1322
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:52,180
Thank you!

1323
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,260
Thank you, thank you.

1324
01:41:54,800 --> 01:42:28,080

dog!

1326
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:33,640
If you do an IRL, won't the perspective be too low?

1327
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:35,100
Hey, hey, hey!

1328
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:36,400
Hey, hey!

1329
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:39,400
Oh!

1330
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:43,560
Oh, I see!

1331
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:44,720
Oh, okay.

1332
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:47,540
I've seen so many people with it.

1333
01:42:47,660 --> 01:42:50,200
I was like, I thought they...

1334
01:42:50,200 --> 01:42:52,660
Maybe people were like, bring Clippy back.

1335
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:05,310
I didn't know anything.

1336
01:43:05,450 --> 01:43:06,630
I don't know anything, you guys.

1337
01:43:08,810 --> 01:43:09,790
I don't know anything.

1338
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:12,870
Clippy.

1339
01:43:13,090 --> 01:43:14,010
Bring Clippy back.

1340
01:43:14,990 --> 01:43:15,690
Or maybe not.

1341
01:43:16,970 --> 01:43:17,870
I don't know.

1342
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:18,510
Anyway.

1343
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:23,130
I hope you guys enjoyed the tour.

1344
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:24,850
Boo.

1345
01:43:25,050 --> 01:43:25,350
Ah!

1346
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:27,230
Why would you...

1347
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:28,010
Why would you do that?

1348
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:29,410
How about the IQ?

1349
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:32,790
This is so funny and the BGM made this extra spooky.

1350
01:43:32,910 --> 01:43:33,610
Enjoyed it a lot.

1351
01:43:33,690 --> 01:43:34,190
I'm glad!

1352
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:36,450
I'm glad, I'm glad!

1353
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:42,440
About right of maintenance and having infinite subscription service.

1354
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:45,460
No, I get it, I get it.

1355
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:49,080
I respect it, I respect it.

1356
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:51,940
PGM was good?

1357
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:58,360
Let me know, I mean, let me help you.

1358
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:01,100
It was one of my best friends and fellow whispers.

1359
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:01,560
Birthday!

1360
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:02,540
Happy birthday, Dylan!

1361
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:04,320
Happy birthday, Dylan!

1362
01:44:04,740 --> 01:44:06,900
Wait, there were some other birthdays I missed.

1363
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:08,020
Wait, hold on.

1364
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:09,100
Hold on.

1365
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:10,740
There were some people's birthdays.

1366
01:44:10,940 --> 01:44:11,860
I'm so sorry.

1367
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:17,320
It's hard during, like, this kind of stream to catch you guys, you know?

1368
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:21,720
Especially because it's like you don't want to interrupt the tour.

1369
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:24,260
So, hold on.

1370
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:37,260
I saw it.

1371
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:38,740
Super chat.

1372
01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:41,060
Oh, good.

1373
01:44:56,360 --> 01:44:57,100
Where'd it go?

1374
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,620
Oh, my first birthday is a wisp!

1375
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:01,560

1376
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:03,180

1378
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:07,900
I hope you're still here.

1379
01:45:08,540 --> 01:45:09,260
Happy birthday.

01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:12,440

Ah, I really want to go...

1388
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,920
Last year, I went on a ghost tour with some friends.

1389
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:54,840
It's kind of funny doing it as a ghost because you're like...

1390
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:56,340

1391
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,080

Thank you.

1408
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:26,880
So when you go ghost hunting, how do you prevent the equipment from picking up you or your EVP?

1409
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,600
Oh, that's a great question.

1410
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:31,500
Honestly, I don't use the EVP because of that.

1411
01:47:32,180 --> 01:48:04,920
like and also if i'm trying to do or not evp oh i thought you i thought oh i was thinking of um emf my bad um for evp when i do evp okay it's like kind of like when you're a ghost and like someone's doing an evp you kind of like have like this weird draw to like say something you know you're just like i feel compelled to speak so i have to try really hard not to speak you know I have to be like

1412
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:40,300

Guys, sometimes I wish I could change my Oshi mark.

1445
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:14,620
Sometimes I want to change it to like a ghost in a box.

1446
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:17,400
Or maybe a ghost in an exclamation point.

1447
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:20,820
I just make Metal Gear by branding.

1452
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:31,980
Yellow gold.

1453
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:33,540
You can do yellow.

1454
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:34,980
Or you can do gold.

01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:36,080

My tests weren't really good on Monday.

1473
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:32,780

1474
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:33,640

1475
01:52:33,820 --> 01:52:34,300

Thank you again for the good luck.

1479
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:41,380
Beam yourself!

1480
01:52:41,480 --> 01:52:41,900
Oh, cool!

1481
01:52:42,060 --> 01:52:43,000
You didn't need it.

1482
01:52:43,700 --> 01:52:44,960
You didn't need it, Evan.

1483
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:48,020
It was all inside you.

1484
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:52,160
You did that.

1485
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:53,420
You.

1486
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:06,340
Yeah, congrats!

1487
01:53:08,380 --> 01:53:10,900
Guys, this whole time I've been having to pee.

1488
01:53:12,620 --> 01:53:14,960
I don't have to pee really bad.

1489
01:53:22,660 --> 01:53:23,740
I think I should go.

1490
01:53:35,390 --> 01:53:39,070
I've been- Wait, how do you become a VTuber?

1491
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:40,670
Just a curious question.

1492
01:53:41,170 --> 01:53:42,170
How do you?

1493
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:45,330
Um...

1494
01:53:45,330 --> 01:53:46,570
Well, I died.

1495
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:49,630
So it's a little different for me.

1496
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:52,350
Wait, why are you guys sending Super Chat?

1497
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:53,730
Stop, I haven't left yet.

1498

I think that's kind of just what I did, is I just started streaming.

1501
01:54:06,060 --> 01:54:08,820
I don't think you have to die for it to...

1502
01:54:09,220 --> 01:54:11,380
for it to...

1503
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:12,060

That's my death of Ligma.

01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:04,840
Wait, I want to recreate the Zam.

She's freaky.

1513
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:07,220
Wait.

1514
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:08,940
How did I do that?

1515
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:10,140
Zam.

1516
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:14,220
Zam.

1517
01:55:14,500 --> 01:55:15,020
She is freaky.

1518
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:27,640
ZAM

1519
01:55:36,650 --> 01:55:53,190

1520
01:55:58,400 --> 01:55:59,380
Hotel troubles?

1521
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:03,060
That doesn't sound so good Happy Hallows E!

1522
01:56:07,360 --> 01:56:14,440
Can't believe tomorrow's Halloween I still don't have an idea of what I'm doing tomorrow.

1523
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:15,800
It's pretty bad.

1524
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:21,660
My brain has been like half stuff I need to do.

1525
01:56:22,160 --> 01:56:23,200
Like that I cannot say.

1526
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:24,920
And half US Idol Festival.

1527
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:32,340
And barely any space for Halloween activity.

1528
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:37,720
That's like your day.

1529
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:38,820
Don't remind me.

1530
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:46,400
Oh, well, it's like last year I had my, oh my gosh, wait, tomorrow it will be one year since my 3.0.

1531
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:47,340
Isn't that kind of crazy?

1532
01:56:49,460 --> 01:56:51,120
So, last year I had that.

1533
01:56:51,720 --> 01:57:02,320
And then earlier this month, I had my birthday live, so it felt like, you know, a lot of stuff already happened, you know.

1534

just a little shum shum but it's been really busy for me lately I'm so sorry guys where my brain has been seriously focused on a million things at once but that's why I like doing game streams so much because I'm just like, I focus on game and I don't have to think about anything else.

1541
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:56,620
It's actually a break for me of thinking about other things.

1542
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:04,180
But it should come down a little bit eventually.

1543
01:59:08,020 --> 01:59:10,300
But yeah, thank you guys for the tour.

1544
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:11,460
Thanks for hanging out with me.

1545
01:59:11,540 --> 01:59:12,440
I hope you enjoyed it.

1546
01:59:12,540 --> 01:59:14,800
I hope you enjoyed all the spooky...

1547
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:16,380
Spookiness that happened too.

1548
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,540
It was fun.

1549
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,980
Thank you for the fun spooky stream.

1550
01:59:27,580 --> 01:59:28,180
And...

1551
01:59:28,180 --> 01:59:29,120
Chill will be fun tomorrow.

1552
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,120
I'm going to go slice up...

1553
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:34,140
What are you slicing up a wisp for?

1554
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,540
But I do think that...

1555
01:59:39,540 --> 01:59:41,380
You guys should check out...

1556
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:42,000
The Hornet?

1557
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,340
V-Fleet, CarrierCon.

1558
01:59:50,220 --> 02:00:04,800
since they've been so awesome to give these tours and everything, take time out of, you know, Gabe Jeff has taken time out of his night even to give us a tour, so.

1559
02:00:05,440 --> 02:00:05,760
Yeah.

1560
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:08,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1561
02:00:09,020 --> 02:00:10,600
To see what's inside.

1562
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:14,360
Goop!

1563
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:16,840
Yeah!

1564
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:23,400
I'll be going on a flight later for vacation and bringing my Mito pleasure with me!

1565
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:24,860
If I can make it for tomorrow's dream.

1566
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:28,300
Jay, have a great vacation, have a safe flight!

1567
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,780
Take lots of pictures and post them so I can see.

1568
02:00:34,200 --> 02:00:34,560
Otsu!

1569
02:00:35,420 --> 02:00:36,140
Mito, everybody!

1570
02:00:36,620 --> 02:00:37,400
Thank you so much.

1571
02:00:37,680 --> 02:00:38,500
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

1572
02:00:38,860 --> 02:00:41,720
Have a good day, have a good night, and I will see you when I see you next!

1573
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:45,660
Jokes on Twitter.

1574
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,100
Okay, I will check it out.

1575
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:48,300
Bye-bye.

1576
02:00:49,300 --> 02:00:50,260
Thank you.

1577
02:00:50,280 --> 02:00:50,840
Thank you.

1578
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:51,240
Thank you.

1579
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:52,240
Bye-bye.

1580
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,900
Bye-bye.

1581
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:55,420
Oh, yes.

1582
02:00:55,480 --> 02:00:55,840
Welcome back.

1583
02:00:55,940 --> 02:00:56,640
Bye-bye-bye-bye-bye.

1584
02:00:56,640 --> 02:00:58,020
Bye-bye.

1585
02:00:58,020 --> 02:01:01,520
I think

1586
02:01:10,480 --> 02:01:13,700
isn't Doobie streaming?

1587
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:16,860
I think I will try to raid her if it lets me.

1588
02:01:17,020 --> 02:01:17,460
Let's see.

1589
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:23,220
Redirect to Doobie.

1590
02:01:24,900 --> 02:01:26,100
A doobster.

1591
02:01:27,720 --> 02:01:31,640
I was watching her play with Limu and Saba earlier, so it was cute.

1592
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,360
Okay, bye-bye.

1593
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:35,140
Have fun.

1594
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:35,820
See you.
