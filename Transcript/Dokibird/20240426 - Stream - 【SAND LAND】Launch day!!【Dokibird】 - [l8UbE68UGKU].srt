00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,370
Hello everybody!

2
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:54,150
Okay, look it was not my fault.

3
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,030
I was late this time.

4
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,310
Okay, I was ready.

5
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:15,870
I was so ready But the reason why I was a little bit late today is because the game wasn't downloadable until launch day And then even then, even then they didn't put it up They didn't put up the download button until five to six minutes later.

6
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,490
So it is not my fault

7
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:42,400
This time, this time I take zero responsibility Okay guys, I might have taken responsibility like in the past But I know for this one time I do not take responsibility for being late It was not my fault!

8
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:51,480
Okay, at one point I almost let the intrusive thoughts win and like because I was like Where download button?

9
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,700
Where download button?

10
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,860
And I was like on Twitch I was like Did anyone else got the download button on Twitch?

11
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:18,800
Because I was like seeing like oh maybe some some Twitch Weimer So I got the download button and then I saw like Bandai was doing an official launch stream of Sandland where they were like, you know hyping up Sandland and I almost I almost typed in chat Where download button?

12
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:38,580
I was gonna be one of those people Because they're like, oh, I hope you guys are happy because I was watching it because I was like watching us like oh, maybe don't know Don't tell us if there's a delay and Then and then they were like we hope you enjoyed Sandland.

13
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:38,940
Yeah.

14
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,420
Oh, it's up.

15
00:03:40,600 --> 00:04:05,440
We hope you enjoy it It's up now guys go and download Sandland for the official launch like on that official stream and I was gonna I was like I was typing us ready I was like We're down though I almost was like we're down though I almost I almost did it but I didn't let the intrusive thoughts win this time.

16
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,440
I didn't become a Karen.

17
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,960
I was like, okay.

18
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll wait

19
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:23,620
I'll wait a little bit but also because the moment I was about to type it The download button showed up so I was saved by the download button.

20
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:34,220
I was saved by the download button actually showing up so I didn't embarrass myself today.

21
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,180
I didn't embarrass myself in front of the poor PR people at Bandai.

22
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,220
Because I think they were also like, oh no where is the download button?

23
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,320
So I didn't use it.

24
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,120
Thank you for the super chat.

25
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,440
Thank you.

26
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:48,940
Thank you.

27
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,880
Play Sandstorm by the dude.

28
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you for the super chat.

29
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,300
Thank you.

30
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:52,720
Thank you.

31
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Alright, for those who don't know this game.

32
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,140
This is Sandland.

33
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:07,560
It is a game that's based off the manga slash anime from Akira Toriyama.

34
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,560
And obviously this is like one of the first games that are released, you know, post... what's the word?

35
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,280
Post-hum...

36
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,580
I can't pronounce it but you know...

37
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,060
Salute to Akira Toriyama.

38
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,800
But this was the first game to be released afterwards.

39
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,100
And you know, I've been super hyped to check it out.

40
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,520
And I'm looking forward to it.

41
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,480
Apparently I was like...

42
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,100
I was like...

43
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,420
Sort of like hesitant on trying this out because I saw it was like RPG.

44
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,900
But then I read that it was like action RPG.

45
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,000
So I was like, I like action.

46
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,160
Maybe the action will balance out the RPG elements.

47
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,200
Maybe... I was like...

48
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,160
Maybe the action part will balance that out.

49
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,540
And because like I'm not like a super...

50
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,760
Because I don't really have that much of an attention span for like RPGs and stuff.

51
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,520
RPGs are good.

52
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,960
Look, it is called preferences.

53
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,200
And...

54
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,840
And like...

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,220
I do not have the attention span for RPGs.

56
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,280
Especially like JRPGs.

57
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,520
Because like I have such a low attention span when it comes to like reading.

58
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,540
That...

59
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,580
That lore goes from one ear to the other and then it disappears.

60
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,740
And then I would be playing the RPG part and I'd be like, what the fuck is going on?

61
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,880
I'd be like...

62
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,720
I'd be like, who's this guy again?

63
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,220
Wait, what's the character...

64
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,300
Who am I playing as?

65
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
What is her story?

66
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,020
I don't know.

67
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,280
And then what I use...

68
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,640
Okay, this is...

69
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,460
Here's a little tidbit about me that will make you understand it more.

70
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,820
So in Pokemon games, when you select moves, I make sure all my Pokemon moves are just straight on full attack.

71
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,020
I don't care about stats or anything.

72
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,560
Like...

73
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,540
Like things that will get rid of stats and all that stuff.

74
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,840
I just want...

75
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,360
I see the PP move and I was like, ooh, it does more damage.

76
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,620
Okay, all four of my moves are ultimate damage.

77
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,340
And so like...

78
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,020
You see that for Pokemon, that's four moves.

79
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,400
Now imagine like I play a JRPG slash RPG and it's all my moves.

80
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:51,060
I'd be like, okay, all my moves just do damage in all my 20 moves that I have in this JRPG.

81
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,380
That's all I know.

82
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,420
And then if I am low, okay, do I have any heals?

83
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
Oh, I don't because I put all my...

84
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,280
I put all my skills in just damage.

85
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,320
Oh, okay.

86
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,400
So...

87
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,300
That is why.

88
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,640
That is why.

89
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,980
Like for me, I know that...

90
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:26,060
I know that like the RPG and JRPG stuff, like I know for me is definitely not my strongest suit.

91
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,360
So I was like, okay, maybe the...

92
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,840
I saw I was watching the gameplay of it and I was like, oh, okay.

93
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,600
I see a lot of open world action in there.

94
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,940
I was like, oh, all right.

95
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,160
I can work with that.

96
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,380
I can work with the open world action.

97
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:41,720
I can work with the open world part.

98
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,200
And I was like, oh, tanks.

99
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,920
I can work with that.

100
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,000
I can work with the tanks too.

101
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,380
And I was like, all right, this is good.

102
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,060
This is good.

103
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,600
This is it.

104
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm going to...

105
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm going to try this out.

106
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,260
And then if you never see a part two of this game, then you know why.

107
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,580
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

108
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:03,940
Thank you.

109
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,400
Thank you.

110
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,940
Every time you talk about reading, you further prove the stereotype that both dragoons and you can't read.

111
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,100
Thank you for the super chat.

112
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,460
Thank you.

113
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,080
Thank you.

114
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,900
All right.

115
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,280
Here you go.

116
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,180
Oh, I mean, it seems all right.

117
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,160
I think.

118
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,740
All right.

119
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Press any key.

120
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,120
Is my sound guy here today?

121
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,200
Is my sound guy here?

122
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,860
Oh, oh, my God.

123
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,140
By the way, I pre-ordered the deluxe version because I was like, I want to be special.

124
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,460
I want to pay to win.

125
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,620
A game that I don't know if we're going to get a part two on.

126
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,480
I was like, I don't know if I'm going to get part two.

127
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,460
But, ooh, more items.

128
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,340
That means more items that can affect my gameplay.

129
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,760
Let's fucking go.

130
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,480
120 FPS limit.

131
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,860
And then that's good.

132
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,480
You don't...

133
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,780
Yes, save these settings.

134
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,280
Okay.

135
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,260
Obviously, voice has to always be up.

136
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,180
I feel like.

137
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,580
Just up the voice.

138
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,220
Guys, I don't...

139
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,840
Guys, I don't know if sound guy is here.

140
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,780
So today, in one of those rare moments, we're going to let the chat...

141
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:22,160
Wait, are any of my mods here?

142
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,060
Oh, no.

143
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,500
No.

144
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,620
This might be...

145
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,320
This might get a little rowdy.

146
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,240
I'll increase it a bit later.

147
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,640
Without it.

148
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,680
Oh, no.

149
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,640
What's that word call when we have actual...

150
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,060
When we have no leaders in place?

151
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,500
Oh, no.

152
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,980
Not the chaos.

153
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,480
Anarchy.

154
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh, no.

155
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,460
It's going to be an anarchy now.

156
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,420
There's no...

157
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
None of the mods are here.

158
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,320
Casually enjoy.

159
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,160
Okay, I'm not gonna do hard... I don't know what this game is gonna be like.

160
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,100
Guys, I'm gonna do normal.

161
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:18,900
I don't have any... if it was an FPS game with like zero...

162
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:23,760
uh... resource... with like zero like... like what was it?

163
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,760
Scarce resource shit?

164
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,980
Then it would be fine.

165
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,880
Who needs mod when there is... oh... oh... oh...

166
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,140
Miracle, thank you for the super chat.

167
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,940
Thank you, thank you.

168
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,580
You think that.

169
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,460
But then when you become a real... when you become an actual streamer...

170
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:44,740
then... then you realize... having mods might... might not be a very... might not be a bad idea.

171
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,880
Cause giving chat too much power... is... is a little stupid.

172
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:03,060
If chat has too much power, it'll just be Twitch... it'll just be a YouTube play sand land.

173
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,260
Oh my god!

174
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,440
Oh my god!

175
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,640
Oh my god!

176
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,320
Mods here!

177
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,600
Guys... guys... our mods... okay.

178
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,260
Alright.

179
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,320
Other silent.

180
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,740
You're... you're gonna be my designated sound guy.

181
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:20,420
I know you have zero like... um... experience with sound.

182
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,800
But I trust you.

183
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,280
Today you're gonna learn.

184
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,500
You're gonna learn to be the new sound guy.

185
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,440
My substitute sound guy.

186
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,000
Scattery.

187
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:36,700
Alright.

188
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm a little worried that this is taking a long time to save.

189
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,600
Oh wait.

190
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,020
Oh wait.

191
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,300
Oh!

192
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,380
It's telling me.

193
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,800
I thought... I thought it was saving my game!

194
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,620
I was like...

195
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,720
I was like...

196
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,840
Why is this taking so long to save?

197
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,240
I was like... damn.

198
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,080
Oh!

199
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,180
Look, it's a little ghost.

200
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,500
I love his style.

201
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,680
It's so recognizable.

202
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,320
I love that he just really loves to draw vehicles too.

203
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,640
I feel like...

204
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,720
He became a manga artist just to draw sick ass vehicles.

205
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,370
Oh my god!

206
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,150
Sound guy's here!

207
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,270
JK... JK other mod.

208
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,690
You're fired and rehired to be like regular mod now.

209
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:38,910
The actual...

210
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,270
No benefits by the way.

211
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,830
No overtime.

212
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,870
No... uh...

213
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,110
No... uh...

214
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,270
No...

215
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,770
No firing package by the way.

216
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:50,210
No... no firing package by the way.

217
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,990
What the fuck?

218
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,750
I never read or watched the manga anime of Sadland.

219
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:57,950
I never read or watched the manga anime of Sadland.

220
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,190
So this is zero context for me.

221
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,940
I think that's called a deep motion.

222
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:09,140
I think that's called a deep motion.

223
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,340
Shit.

224
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,400
What happens if I lose him?

225
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,020
Bro there's no way I can lose him.

226
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:18,620
Bro there's no way I can lose him.

227
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,880
There's no way I can go.

228
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,340
I can't even run off into the distance.

229
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,700
I can't even run off into the distance bro.

230
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,520
I can't even run off into the distance bro.

231
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,190
Yeah no severance pay by the way.

232
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,550
Okay that guy's just a centaur.

233
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,290
Okay that guy's just a centaur.

234
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,250
I can't believe he grouped up the centaur.

235
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,850
With an actual...

236
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,410
Oh shit!

237
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,150
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,890
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,210
I was trying to be a streamer.

240
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,550
Alright here we go.

241
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,130
Yay!

242
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,230
Okay not gonna lie.

243
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:01,330
Alright this is a little bit of a nitpicky.

244
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,110
But like I hate the subtitle font.

245
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,570
The subtitle font is pretty bad.

246
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,290
The subtitle font is pretty bad.

247
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,730
Oh my god!

248
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:19,970
They're in the middle of nowhere.

249
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,150
They're in the middle of nowhere.

250
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,950
Thanks for the water.

251
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,930
You're just gonna leave them to die?

252
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,270
You're a demon.

253
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,730
Demons don't need water.

254
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,450
I mean he's a fucking demon.

255
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,410
How are they gonna drive back?

256
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,290
This is why I'm being jerked.

257
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:43,970
I'm in the desert or jungle.

258
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,970
This is exactly why I'm like...

259
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,250
Being stuck in the middle of the desert.

260
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,430
There's no water.

261
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,650
What the fuck are you gonna do?

262
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,710
Do I have to wait for their moves?

263
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,870
Oh I was gonna say...

264
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:55,870
Powerful.

265
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,110
Wait bullets don't work on me anyway.

266
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,610
Right?

267
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,670
Shoot me.

268
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:02,030
Shoot me.

269
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:03,850
Come on!

270
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,710
Shoot me!

271
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,670
Yeah it does nothing.

272
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,850
There's no sense of...

273
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,090
There's no sense of like...

274
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,150
Actual urgency.

275
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,570
That's my chance?

276
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,150
What?

277
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,310
Oh epic attack.

278
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:24,550
There you go.

279
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,090
Get over here.

280
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,850
I'm gonna beat you up too.

281
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,950
Get over here.

282
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,390
That's fucking right.

283
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,070
Get over here.

284
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,390
Get over here.

285
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:32,670
Come on.

286
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,290
Get over here.

287
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,070
Stop running away.

288
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,690
Get over here.

289
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,530
Get over here.

290
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,330
Get over here.

291
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,110
Get over here.

292
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,350
You can't run away from me.

293
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,050
Get over here.

294
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,710
You're full HP already but I beat the shit out of you.

295
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,170
Get over here.

296
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:45,570
Come on.

297
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,630
Stop running away.

298
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:49,250
Alright.

299
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:50,090
Boop.

300
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,510
Boop.

301
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,690
Nice.

302
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,130
And they forever disappeared.

303
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,170
They vanished.

304
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,910
Back into the sand you go.

305
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,430
The nature...

306
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,510
The nature of...

307
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,030
I think I can absorb them.

308
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,590
Okay.

309
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:09,710
Who the fuck...

310
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,710
His name is Grumman.

311
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,610
There's a little ferret kid too.

312
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:13,990
Alright.

313
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:18,690
Let's boost up the volume a little bit.

314
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:19,850
Alright.

315
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:19,850
Let's boost up the volume a little bit.

316
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:20,030
Oh wait.

317
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,370
I can actually boost up the volume within the in-game settings.

318
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,050
What am I doing?

319
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,970
Alright.

320
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,450
Which...

321
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,450
I like how if I don't press anything it just be like, oh my god.

322
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,150
I have a couple seconds of silence.

323
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,150
We're only taking a bit.

324
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,180
We leave them to a little bit.

325
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I just took everything.

326
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,680
Then I just took all his fucking water.

327
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,140
Oh, it's like Mad Max.

328
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,520
It's like Japan Mad Max.

329
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,020
Cause like...

330
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,600
He has all the water.

331
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,120
Alright, let me...

332
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:22,540
Guys, apparently you can't go to the menu.

333
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,700
You can't go to the menu while you're talking.

334
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,530
It's Anime Australia.

335
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,830
Exactly.

336
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
Make that kid pay.

337
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,060
Yeah, but what if she drinks all the water after that?

338
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,380
He's still gonna die.

339
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,900
You didn't solve anything.

340
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:10,100
If we're gonna start doing good deeds, we might as well turn in our pitchforks.

341
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,420
Shut it.

342
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,820
I'll torment the kid plenty once he grows up.

343
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,660
If he's gonna grow up.

344
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:15,660
I'll torment the kid plenty once he grows up.

345
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,080
If he's gonna grow up.

346
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,800
You're just delaying it.

347
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,020
He'll die regardless.

348
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,160
You're just delaying it.

349
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,160
He'll die regardless.

350
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,580
He still has no source of water.

351
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,760
Joshua, thank you for the magenta soup.

352
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,840
Thank you, thank you.

353
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,380
Why is young Majin Buu cruising around with a trolley?

354
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,500
Why is young Majin Buu cruising around with a trolley?

355
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,860
Doki, I don't think Mad Max has the wrong center.

356
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,720
That's right.

357
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:41,480
It's a better version of Mad Max.

358
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,090
It's a better version of Mad Max.

359
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,410
This guy.

360
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,950
Oh, this is a different centaur.

361
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,220
Who's he?

362
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,180
Wait, who's dying?

363
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,180
Who the fuck is slime?

364
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,820
Who the fuck is slime?

365
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,640
I think he accidentally fell asleep in the sun again.

366
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,680
I think he accidentally fell asleep in the sun again.

367
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,540
I think he accidentally fell asleep in the sun again.

368
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,660
Maddy, thank you for the super chat.

369
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,580
Thank you, thank you.

370
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,580
Mad Max if it was good.

371
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,100
Just because it's anime.

372
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,960
It doesn't mean it's better than the original.

373
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,460
It doesn't mean it's better than the original.

374
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,160
Nothing's ever easy.

375
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:43,800
Nothing's ever easy.

376
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,120
It's like.

377
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,300
Okay, to be fair.

378
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,900
The anime bible is sort of better than the regular bible.

379
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,700
Okay, this is my opinion.

380
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,560
Okay guys, so in case I get canceled or anything.

381
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,300
Just remember this was my opinion.

382
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,580
But I think anime Jesus is a bit better than regular Jesus.

383
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,740
I am tied up with other tasks though.

384
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,300
Huh.

385
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,580
Fine.

386
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,260
You don't know anime Jesus?

387
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:31,200
The bible actually has a manga slash anime based off of it.

388
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,400
Alright, after accepting a new quest.

389
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,080
A quest icon will appear on the map.

390
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,140
To show where you should go to progress the quest.

391
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,160
Oh yeah, sound guy.

392
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,020
Should I increase the overall volume including voice?

393
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,420
Or is it just like some parts of the game?

394
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,360
I'll divvy it up then.

395
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,080
Cause there's like.

396
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,480
Uh.

397
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,580
Oh, I can dash.

398
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,680
Okay, oh thank god.

399
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,620
I can run faster.

400
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,240
Cause.

401
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,520
We have.

402
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,900
We have multiple.

403
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,440
Oh, oh, oh.

404
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,460
Okay, okay.

405
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
Oh yeah.

406
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,320
This is like first day launch stuff.

407
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,040
Okay.

408
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,440
Okay guys.

409
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,960
We realize.

410
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,340
Guys, we realize.

411
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,620
What launch day is gonna be like.

412
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,340
Oh.

413
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,820
Oh.

414
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,500
Maybe it's just this place.

415
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,300
You know.

416
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:21,900
Maybe.

417
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,100
Oh okay.

418
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,120
We have to read this.

419
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,660
Why does he have a voice?

420
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,460
Okay.

421
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,940
Okay.

422
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,920
He has a voice.

423
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,720
Everybody else.

424
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,940
Fuck the other guys I guess.

425
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,820
Fuck that one centaur in general.

426
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,240
Okay.

427
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,620
Okay.

428
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,340
Let's see.

429
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,740
I have to go this way.

430
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,440
I wonder how many of these NPCs are just one guy.

431
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,520
Doing like ten voices.

432
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,800
Raptor scales?

433
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,740
Oh, it's not even a.

434
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,360
A regular side quest.

435
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:17,880
Hey.

436
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
You okay?

437
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:19,860
Here.

438
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,820
Have some water.

439
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,960
For free?

440
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,600
What kind of fucking demon are you?

441
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,100
Want a toe down?

442
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,900
Thank you for the super chat.

443
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,240
Thank you.

444
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,700
Thank you.

445
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,460
Using that logic.

446
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,680
Does that mean non-AnimeDokiBird is better than AnimeDokiBird?

447
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,060
Thank you for the super chat.

448
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,520
Thank you.

449
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,140
Thank you.

450
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,840
You're a demon!

451
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
You can't die from dehydration?

452
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:46,800
You can't die from dehydration?

453
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,260
Oh, I get stuff?

454
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,960
Oh my god.

455
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,340
I got something in return.

456
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,380
I got B grade steel.

457
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,040
Nice.

458
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Alright, at least... I guess helping people is good sometimes.

459
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,780
I guess sometime it's good.

460
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,100
Oh, I just like walked away from him.

461
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,780
Was I supposed to help him?

462
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,700
I like that I was supposed to talk to him.

463
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,760
I was like, alright, anyway.

464
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,460
And the game was like, wait, come back.

465
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,880
Wait, did you forgot this one kid?

466
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,800
And it's a tie.

467
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,280
Here you go.

468
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,540
Here's some water.

469
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,360
I guess.

470
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,840
I'm running out.

471
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,020
It's just a side character.

472
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,720
Leave him.

473
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,840
By the way, raise up the volume.

474
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,680
Let me know if it's better.

475
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,660
Sound guy.

476
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,360
Yeah, you know what?

477
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,280
Fuck the humans.

478
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,800
If we let more humans die, there's more chances for them to become demons.

479
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,640
So smart.

480
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,860
Alright, we go.

481
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,540
We gotta go talk to the slime.

482
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,700
Cause apparently he's also dying.

483
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,700
I can double jump now.

484
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,320
Ooh.

485
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,820
Ooh.

486
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,160
Hello.

487
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,480
Is that him?

488
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,560
Oh, I thought I could step on him.

489
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,460
Hello.

490
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,840
Oh, I think I'm on the wrong side.

491
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,100
Who's there?

492
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,360
Who's there?

493
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:40,800
Hello.

494
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,280
I don't think he looks okay.

495
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:54,920
But if he's the slime king and I'm the prince demon...

496
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,420
It would be a shame...

497
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,860
Okay, it would be a shame if I don't do it in time.

498
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,380
Wait, actually...

499
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,240
It would be such a shame if I...

500
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,660
If we ran out of time.

501
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,940
Oh no!

502
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,220
Long live the king!

503
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,100
God, what a waste of water!

504
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,620
Also, how much water is in this bottle?

505
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,520
Thomas, thank you for your favorite super chat!

506
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,620
Thank you, thank you!

507
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,080
And my dokey bird JoJo's tense tomato.

508
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,010
I'm gonna go get some water.

509
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,630
Oh my water!

510
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,270
I'm alive again!

511
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,770
This is the king?

512
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:59,110
Oh, thought you were a goner!

513
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,230
Uh-huh, great.

514
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,370
Why is your voice so dang loud?

515
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,680
Yeah!

516
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,980
Quest complete!

517
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,560
Stop falling asleep in the sun, would ya?

518
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,800
He's just a regular guy?

519
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,690
I thought they said slime king!

520
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,290
I'm a real scorcher!

521
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,310
He's just a regular slime?!

522
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,370
I wasted all my water on this one slime?!

523
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,290
The name is always...

524
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,450
Should've been survival of the fittest.

525
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,790
If he was dumb enough to get like melted by the sun, he did not deserve to live.

526
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,550
Why'd the world have to end up like this?

527
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,470
We need to have powerful slimes.

528
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,790
Things have been like this for around 50 years now.

529
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,990
Ever since man's foolishness...

530
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,530
and a succession of natural disasters...

531
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,990
To be a kind ruler, what's that?

532
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,570
...to extend farther and farther...

533
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,730
until it had swallowed up the entire world.

534
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,570
What does that mean?

535
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,910
I thought I bring up the volume a little bit more already.

536
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,610
I just brought up the volume.

537
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,350
...who somehow managed to survive.

538
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,750
Well, they just kept on waging their pointless wars.

539
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,760
You're in position!

540
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,700
Oh wait, what?

541
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,740
The war is just ahead!

542
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,660
We have received word that the P.G.

543
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,460
have died in time!

544
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:35,480
Oh!

545
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,420
Oh no!

546
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,660
Oh no, I didn't realize the ammo's limited.

547
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,480
Nice.

548
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,520
Annihilate the enemy!

549
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
No, I missed!

550
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,660
Protect the P.G.!

551
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,080
Okay, got it.

552
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,620
We can't let them destroy that machine.

553
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,380
Guard it at all costs!

554
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,940
World of tanks time!

555
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,420
Anime world of tanks!

556
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,720
Just like anime mad mad.

557
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,060
Max!

558
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,760
Why do I do my nitro?

559
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,700
Like this?

560
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,280
What am I supposed to do?

561
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,880
Boom?

562
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,100
Oh!

563
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:20,980
That's it?

564
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,340
Just one shot?

565
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:34,650
Yeah, Toria, I'mma love the vehicles.

566
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,780
And so...

567
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,020
That woman?

568
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,660
The humanity's inane belligerence resulted...

569
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,720
Oh no, that's the helmet.

570
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:51,600
I thought that was hair.

571
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,400
...in the worst possible outcome for the entire planet.

572
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,090
Just cause of one stupid mistake, man.

573
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,620
I wish somebody would have make a compilation of like all his like vehicle art.

574
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,680
Or vehicle designs.

575
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,160
They're all the same.

576
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,200
I feel so creative too.

577
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:38,370
In some alternate universe, instead of Teslas, we would have Toriyama vehicles.

578
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,330
Why?

579
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,770
Man, I wonder why.

580
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:51,810
Man,

581
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:01,610
I wonder why.

582
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,970
This encounter is about to change this dying wasteland forever.

583
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,970
Oh my god, it's the iconic!

584
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:12,010
It's the iconic Toriyama car!

585
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,010
Or bike!

586
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,840
Girl.

587
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,060
Sandalaboma!

588
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,100
A human.

589
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,120
Mr. Earthworm!

590
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,400
Hercules!

591
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,440
That's right, I'm a human.

592
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,120
I come from a neighboring town.

593
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,200
But like, what if he just has no muscles?

594
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,420
I'm here to help.

595
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,700
Because I want to ask for you demons' help.

596
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,540
Now, is one of your leaders willing to listen to what I have to say?

597
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,120
Oh my god, Mr. Satan!

598
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,400
I don't know why I said Mr. Hercules.

599
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,340
He even has an S for a badge!

600
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,620
I see him as Hercules instead of Satan.

601
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,320
So, are you the demon's leader?

602
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,060
That's me!

603
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,940
The great king Lucifer is our leader.

604
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:36,880
But...

605
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,220
Oh, that's my dad!

606
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,740
Hercules was his Christian name.

607
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,060
I'm the fiend prince Beelzebub.

608
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,740
Oh, his English name is Hercules!

609
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,120
I knew it!

610
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,400
I was like, oh my god, did I actually fucked up?

611
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,100
I watched Dragon Ball Z so much.

612
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,680
How did I confuse Hercules and Satan?

613
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,140
I was like...

614
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,980
Okay, I might not have recently watched Dragon Ball.

615
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,360
But I grew up with that.

616
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,260
How the fuck did I mess that up?

617
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,380
I like your assistance with my mission.

618
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,260
Searching for the legendary spring.

619
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,840
The legendary spring?

620
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,100
The legendary spring?

621
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:26,640
Explain.

622
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,000
Sorry, thank you for the super chat.

623
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,740
Thank you, thank you.

624
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,400
Hi Doki, love the content.

625
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,440
It's not a problem.

626
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,800
Would you mind wishing my friend Giggles a happy birthday?

627
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,160
It would mean a lot to her.

628
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,520
Of course!

629
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,580
Happy birthday to you.

630
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,560
Happy birthday to you.

631
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,800
Happy birthday dear Giggles.

632
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,500
Happy birthday to you.

633
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:47,880
Yeah!

634
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,020
You must have sun stroke or something.

635
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,220
Whoops.

636
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,280
Sorry.

637
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,400
A water finch?

638
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,260
It's still alive?

639
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,240
It still exists?

640
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:32,870
Because I saw a water finch flying north yesterday.

641
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,050
Oh my god, that means there's water!

642
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,790
This means there must be a spring with small fish to sustain these birds.

643
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,710
Somewhere in this desert...

644
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,270
There must not be a lot though.

645
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,250
Because it's just one pool of water.

646
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:56,030
But the desert to the south of here is dangerous and wild.

647
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:57,770
But the desert to the south of here is dangerous and wild.

648
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,410
I doubt a lone human could make it even so far as half a mile away.

649
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,510
That's why I'm here.

650
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:08,650
I would like for a powerful demon to accompany me on my journey.

651
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,510
Let's say we somehow manage to find this spring.

652
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,550
Yeah but what if we like end up like eating all the fish in the spring?

653
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,610
Because like humans or demons are greedy motherfuckers.

654
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:23,930
And because of that and then the birds will die.

655
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,350
And then we're gonna ruin the ecosystem!

656
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,190
And then we're gonna have another global warming!

657
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,110
Between them?

658
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:36,630
Yeah, 2x2 water pod.

659
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,730
Bro, like it's a fucking spring, not a lake.

660
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,910
There's a king too?

661
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:03,390
You guys have a king as well?

662
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:12,110
I don't think the world can get any warmer, Doki.

663
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,810
We must find this spring by ourselves for the people.

664
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,910
Doesn't sound like a bad deal.

665
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,990
But we've been doing fine stealing water for ourselves.

666
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:36,570
Yeah, why don't we trick him to tell us where the spring is and then kill him?

667
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:41,450
What the fuck is that?

668
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,330
Like a playstation?

669
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:48,030
Does that need electricity which needs water?

670
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:57,970
Oh my god, bro, he gave me a playstation.

671
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,310
Pills, thank you for the 10, get the shits, thank you.

672
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,590
Don't I need water to run electricity?

673
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,250
Like what?

674
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:12,610
I'll ask my dad for permission.

675
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,140
Is that- that's a Saturn?

676
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,360
It looks like a playstation 1 to me.

677
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,780
I never had a Sega Saturn.

678
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:26,420
I thought it was a playstation 1 but like what if it's black?

679
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,400
What if it was like copyright free playstation 1?

680
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,380
I mean, he brought us a game console.

681
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,700
How are we guys- how are we gonna play this game?

682
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,560
But what if he's got the- How are we gonna plug in the Sega Saturn?

683
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,280
I don't know if he means us harm.

684
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,700
And if he does, I'll kick him into next week.

685
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,240
There's still wind power.

686
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,680
Does this look like we have wind?

687
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,500
Solar power.

688
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,720
Dude, does this look like we live in a place that has electricity, guys?

689
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,290
Join what?

690
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:15,170
I like how so- I like how this guy has- has voice acting.

691
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,170
Oh, heard about the Peachy, Prince?

692
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:21,770
Uh, yeah.

693
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:22,870
Peachy?

694
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,830
That rings a bell.

695
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,170
Who's that?

696
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,910
Their aliens supposedly came to Earth about 70 years ago.

697
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,350
And shared their super advanced tech with humans.

698
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:38,590
I hear they've all been wiped out by this point though.

699
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:45,970
Guys, if we had electricity, we would not be using fire as our light source.

700
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,650
If we have solar power.

701
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:52,390
Because goddamn, we have so much solar.

702
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:53,930
Like...

703
00:38:58,610 --> 00:38:59,830
Okay, it's...

704
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,490
Where is it?

705
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:01,830
Is it...

706
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,730
I assume it's here because there's guards.

707
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,460
I hear ya.

708
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,080
Magic maybe?

709
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,360
I've yet to see anything that's powered by energy, guys.

710
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,480
Maybe it's the aesthetic.

711
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Fire saves electricity.

712
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,420
Doki, you don't understand.

713
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,380
But we got tanks and cars.

714
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,160
We don't know if the demons have tanks and cars.

715
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,300
We just saw the humans.

716
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,370
Hey, Dad.

717
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,150
Oh, what?

718
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:57,010
That's that guy in Dragon- I think I was like, everything from Dragon Ball Z.

719
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,510
Yes.

720
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,630
I heard.

721
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,940
Aide him.

722
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,940
Let humans' plan will benefit us as well.

723
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,900
The Buddha!

724
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:11,340
And he seems trustworthy enough.

725
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,940
And it gives you a chance to sharpen your skills.

726
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,140
Y-Yes, sir!

727
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,340
That said...

728
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,860
Once you return, you're only allowed to use that console for a while.

729
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,540
One hour?

730
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,360
One hour?

731
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,360
I'm already only 20 minutes away from one hour!

732
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,080
Be sure to only play in a bright room.

733
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,900
That's like half a tutorial in Kingdom Hearts!

734
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,780
Not even half.

735
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,420
That's like one fourth of a tutorial.

736
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,660
That's like 20% of the tutorial in Kingdom Hearts.

737
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,140
It's weird.

738
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,500
Booo!

739
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,380
We're going in this?

740
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,760
How many passengers can fit?

741
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,080
With luggage?

742
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,920
Well, can we fit our centaur?

743
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,720
Two?

744
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,740
Then, me...

745
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:19,240
Centaur.

746
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,580
He's- Look at him!

747
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,280
He has abs!

748
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,320
Thief, I guess.

749
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,140
What?

750
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,780
Why me?

751
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:29,880
He's old!

752
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,760
He's old!

753
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:30,900
He's old!

754
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,960
Centaur has abs!

755
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,220
Look at him!

756
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,280
You're good at stealing!

757
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,140
Bro, he doesn't even get the car!

758
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,620
Just run behind us!

759
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:46,280
Grinch, I just thought of something.

760
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:50,020
Wouldn't it be easier to have someone who can fly carry you there?

761
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,700
Quit complaining and get your butt in here right now!

762
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,460
No, it's cause he's strong!

763
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,520
Like, we...

764
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,780
Bro, he can just run after us with his horse legs!

765
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:15,720
Head to the legendary spring.

766
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,580
Believe in the old guy.

767
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,120
Two old men instead one.

768
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,840
Why?

769
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,400
Imbalance.

770
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,000
Too many old men.

771
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,460
Please pick support.

772
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,260
How long do you think this is gonna take?

773
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,920
Call me Raul, please.

774
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,800
Raul.

775
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,480
And, well, probably quite some time.

776
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,940
Hey, let me take the wheel for a bit.

777
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,380
Leave the human machines to their makers, ladies.

778
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,600
Sure, take it for a spin.

779
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,820
For real?

780
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,920
Oh my god, I'm gonna learn how to drive!

781
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,380
I'm gonna get my first driving lesson!

782
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,300
Oh, I'm gonna get my first driving lesson!

783
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,440
Can he, like, touch the pedals?

784
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,800
Like, he's so short!

785
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:02,980
Alright.

786
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:04,660
Autopilot.

787
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,740
Oh my god, thank god.

788
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:07,340
Alright.

789
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:07,860
Boost.

790
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,640
Brake.

791
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,900
Fast travel to towns or camps where you've already been in the map menu.

792
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,600
Move the cursor or desire to hold X and X to travel there.

793
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,040
Fast travel might be disabled.

794
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:17,580
Okay.

795
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,480
Uh, let's see.

796
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,000
Why to leave vehicle.

797
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,300
Uh, move autopilot.

798
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:23,880
Boost.

799
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,480
Brake.

800
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:24,800
Okay.

801
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:25,340
First time driving.

802
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,740
Alright, that's the autopilot.

803
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,400
Can you guys tell?

804
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,800
JK, that was actually me.

805
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,220
That was actually me.

806
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,160
I tricked you guys.

807
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,580
JK, that was actually autopilot.

808
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,280
Hahaha!

809
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,280
Oh, I can boost in autopilot!

810
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,240
Can I, like...

811
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,820
Get rid of... Okay, I can get rid of autopilot if I...

812
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,260
Wait, what happens if I go, like...

813
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,660
Oh.

814
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,420
Okay.

815
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,500
So, I don't...

816
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,400
Oh, guys!

817
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:56,800
Guys!

818
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,980
Did you see that?

819
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,520
I drove off the cliff and it took me closer to the destination!

820
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,540
It's the secret!

821
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,580
It's the secret guys!

822
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,420
Okay, no, JK.

823
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:14,940
JK, I was just next to it.

824
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,680
You have HP?

825
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,060
Where?

826
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,820
There's no HP.

827
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,320
Oh my god, I can drift!

828
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:22,960
Look at that!

829
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,740
I'm drifting!

830
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,680
Am I drifting?

831
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,600
I can't tell.

832
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:29,340
Alright.

833
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,280
There you go.

834
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:32,980
We're doing it.

835
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,440
Speedrun strat.

836
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,200
Wait, what's that over there?

837
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,800
There's something over here!

838
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,680
Wait, I gotta take a break here.

839
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,760
There's stuff there!

840
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,480
Did you guys see that?

841
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,480
Look!

842
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:57,880
What's over here?

843
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,700
There has to be stuff in this cave, right?

844
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,460
Oh my god, look at all this loot!

845
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,880
Oh, I can't punch a scorpion.

846
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,940
9 out of 10 can't punch scorpions.

847
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,940
Oh my god, I already got loot.

848
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:10,700
Guys.

849
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,780
Look at all this loot that I got.

850
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,240
Nice.

851
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,420
Alright.

852
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,840
We gotta go back.

853
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:17,780
Vegetable oil?

854
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,420
Oh my god, I can cook now too.

855
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:21,220
I got vegetable oil.

856
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,040
Alright.

857
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,140
Woah, what's that?!

858
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:26,080
Get out!

859
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,500
Wait, did you guys see that?

860
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:30,100
Oh my god, what is that?!

861
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,260
Oh, I'm already out!

862
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,600
Okay, now it's a 10 out of 10 game again.

863
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:44,380
Now it's a 10 out of 10.

864
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,820
I'm gonna run over the babies first.

865
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:55,180
Okay, now it's a 10 out of 10 game again.

866
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,920
That's right.

867
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,140
Oh my god, it's switching!

868
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,300
Don't worry, I need to double tap.

869
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,680
There we go.

870
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,420
Alright, let's leave.

871
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,000
I get one experience for that!

872
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,180
That's so fucked up.

873
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:17,980
Alright, there we go.

874
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,760
Let's leave now.

875
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:21,960
No!

876
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,120
I overheated!

877
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,260
Oh, is that more babies?

878
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,860
Oh, she's not adopted.

879
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,600
Look, see!

880
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,200
I introduced a mom to new babies that she can adopt!

881
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,980
I realized there were...

882
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,540
Guys, no, you don't understand.

883
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,480
You don't understand, guys.

884
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,180
I saw the babies up there with no mom.

885
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,660
So, obviously, I had to make sure they get adopted.

886
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,820
So, I found a mom that had babies.

887
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,260
And then I killed those babies so the mom can adopt the new babies.

888
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,960
And then we solved the all...

889
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,680
Orphan problem.

890
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,900
I'm a hero.

891
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,540
I gave those babies a mom!

892
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,120
Woah,

893
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,020
what the fuck?

894
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,580
I literally ran over some babies.

895
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:26,540
What do you mean?

896
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:29,220
Okay.

897
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,700
The Genji dragon will chase after your car.

898
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,000
It buries deep under the earth.

899
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:36,020
Oh, we're Dune now.

900
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,980
Anime Dune time.

901
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:42,160
Clear it to you, then use to dodge left and right.

902
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,040
Okay, I just need to dodge.

903
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:45,820
This is 10.

904
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,200
Oooh.

905
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,460
He wouldn't know where I'm going if I just go left and right.

906
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,340
There's no way.

907
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,840
He wouldn't know where I'm going if I just...

908
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,380
If I'm just left and right all the time.

909
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:04,460
Oh shit, did I miss?

910
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,340
How?

911
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,360
Oh god, oh god.

912
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,880
Okay, maybe...

913
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,280
Woo!

914
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,000
Woo!

915
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,520
I'm going as fast...

916
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:14,900
What?

917
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,780
How am I supposed to dodge that?

918
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,680
I'm trying!

919
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,740
I don't know how he knows!

920
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,880
Every time!

921
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,140
Every time!

922
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,820
Maybe stop zigzagging.

923
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,640
No, I don't know man.

924
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,860
Guys, I don't know.

925
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,100
Oh, I did it!

926
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,900
Guys, I should stop zigzagging.

927
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,340
I just figured it out.

928
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:43,980
I'm trying!

929
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:45,900
It won't let me boost!

930
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,180
Oh my god!

931
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,520
It doesn't let me boost!

932
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,600
I can just drive!

933
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:54,920
Oh my god!

934
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,080
I'm driving as fast as I can, bro.

935
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,100
Grandpa, I'm literally driving as fast as I can.

936
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,020
No!

937
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:12,780
Armaterius!

938
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,740
Turn around!

939
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,440
He's already dead!

940
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,780
Turn around and get our shit back!

941
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,620
Turn around

942
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,200
and get our shit back!

943
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,920
That was our one month supplies that we just lost.

944
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:34,480
He just barely escaped!

945
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,450
We're barely outside the village.

946
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,850
And we've lost all our food and water.

947
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:50,070
We lost all our food and water!

948
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:54,110
We...

949
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,980
Well, I guess we lost all of it.

950
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,240
We lost all of it.

951
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,100
So, what should we do?

952
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:18,580
Without provisions, surely our only choice is to turn back.

953
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
Yeah, how the fuck are we to survive without food or water?

954
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,540
I knew I should have looted those babies.

955
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:29,380
You know, there should be a town called Talbo not too far from here.

956
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,320
Not that I have any money, but we'll figure something out.

957
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,800
We don't have money?

958
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,900
You're a sheriff!

959
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:38,600
We don't have money?

960
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:38,600
You're a sheriff!

961
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,460
Fine then.

962
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:41,880
He's broke!

963
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:42,660
Fine then.

964
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,280
Let's get rid of him.

965
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,900
What do you mean?

966
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:47,560
We don't have money!

967
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,320
Alright, we'll probably get back to the car.

968
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,500
Alright, we'll probably get back to the car.

969
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,900
I'm a child!

970
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,340
Please, try to leave!

971
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,400
Oh, what's this?

972
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,200
There's a duck here.

973
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:57,620
Oh, what's this?

974
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:57,620
There's a duck here.

975
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,960
Oh, a new treasure!

976
00:50:59,100 --> 00:50:59,680
What is that?

977
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,440
Ah, shucks.

978
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,800
It's just a toy duck.

979
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,300
It's got balls.

980
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,160
It has bite marks too.

981
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,940
They must have been so hungry.

982
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,700
They'd even eat a toy.

983
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:10,500
Oh no!

984
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:12,300
That's no laughing matter.

985
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,820
Those poor children!

986
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,920
There's no military food relief here.

987
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,660
And bandits are rampant.

988
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,180
It's no wonder the people would starve.

989
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,200
My god.

990
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,660
Rumor has it that starvation drove them to eat horrible food.

991
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,420
Cannibals!

992
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:28,020
Horrible?

993
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,460
Like what?

994
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,220
Like their own fucking kind.

995
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:34,840
Prince, some things are better left unsaid.

996
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,920
Why?

997
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,760
Because we're talking about humans doing something.

998
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,360
Something that is taboo, even to us.

999
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,380
Cannibalism?

1000
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,820
Is cannibalism our line?

1001
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,520
Oh, not murder.

1002
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:54,880
Hold on.

1003
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:00,540
It's not murder, but cannibalism is our line here.

1004
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:01,860
And yet...

1005
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:08,540
They must have been in dire straits to come so close to breaking that taboo.

1006
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:15,180
So you're saying this toy like symbolizes a taboo.

1007
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,920
That's kinda cool.

1008
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,220
I'll keep it.

1009
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:19,880
Cannibalism.

1010
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,480
Bad.

1011
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,680
Murder?

1012
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,000
Okay.

1013
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,360
Nice, I got a toy.

1014
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,300
Wait, there's people here.

1015
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,700
Where are all the people?

1016
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,240
Oh, there's no people there.

1017
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,300
Wait, is he bad?

1018
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,100
So why did they all leave?

1019
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,600
Are you bad?

1020
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,400
I'd like to move somewhere safer.

1021
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,720
It's dangerous around here.

1022
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,080
There's people here.

1023
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:46,420
There's Riku.

1024
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,190
Okay, you don't have to yell.

1025
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,470
And you what?

1026
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,730
See, I was headed for Talbo.

1027
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:02,570
But I couldn't find the Arch landmark and got hopelessly lost.

1028
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:08,950
I thought I was a goner until I came across a traveling merchant in this ghost town.

1029
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:11,690
But now I know I'm a goner.

1030
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:14,130
Why'd I have to run into demons of all things?

1031
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:16,750
It must be my destiny to die here.

1032
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:19,590
For such a fraidy cat, he sure can talk.

1033
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:21,070
Cool it.

1034
00:53:21,150 --> 00:53:22,330
We're not gonna kill you.

1035
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:23,110
Just go.

1036
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:24,890
Really?

1037
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:25,370
Thanks!

1038
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,370
Not until you give me shit.

1039
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:29,070
I'm just gonna let him go?

1040
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,830
I'm just gonna let this man go?

1041
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:33,230
That's it?

1042
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,530
That's his entire plot?

1043
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:37,190
Oh hey, there's a... there's a traveler.

1044
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:38,610
Can I beat up this dinosaur?

1045
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:40,230
Oh, I can't.

1046
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:41,550
Who is he?

1047
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:43,970
Is he a merchant in this world?

1048
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,560
Please!

1049
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:52,520
I'm begging you!

1050
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:53,960
Just don't steal my soul!

1051
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,940
Anything but that!

1052
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,080
I can't steal souls.

1053
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,840
And even if I could, why would I want to?

1054
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,940
What is my purpose?

1055
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,680
As a demon, what can I do?

1056
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,760
How am I different from a regular person?

1057
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,120
You sure changed his tune quickly.

1058
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:12,920
Louder voices?

1059
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,140
Okay, I'll...

1060
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,280
What are you doing here?

1061
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,360
Up the voices, guys.

1062
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,000
Hey.

1063
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,600
Oh, I'm just a humble peddler, traveling all over this kingdom to sell my wares.

1064
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,420
Now lower the sound.

1065
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,260
I'm running low on inventory, so I'm heading back home.

1066
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,460
I have a tail.

1067
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,340
So you don't live here?

1068
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:35,980
Alright.

1069
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:36,480
Of course not.

1070
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,600
This village was abandoned.

1071
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,320
Why is that?

1072
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:46,160
Well, this and that happened, and the residents... went away.

1073
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,460
How about being less vague?

1074
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:56,940
This whole village was built from the ground up during the old war, to create a safe place to send civilian evacuees.

1075
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,800
The old war?

1076
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,940
Oh, the one with the tanks?

1077
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,640
So did the royal army supply shipments.

1078
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,960
That cut down the population lickety-split.

1079
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:07,440
And as if that was...

1080
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:07,740
Oh, it's the old war.

1081
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,880
It's like survival of the fittest.

1082
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,060
...started raiding the place once the army pulled out of the area.

1083
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,240
What you see before you is the result.

1084
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,100
You'd better watch out for bandits yourselves.

1085
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:20,120
Heh.

1086
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,660
Like petty thieves are gonna...

1087
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:22,960
Can I run over the bandits?

1088
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,060
Well, you never can be too careful.

1089
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,300
You know what they say.

1090
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,300
An ounce of prevention's worth a pound of cure.

1091
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,040
On that note, check out my wares!

1092
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,500
They're sure to come in handy on your travels.

1093
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:40,340
What do you have for sale?

1094
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,620
Okay, before that, I'm gonna like...

1095
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,340
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1096
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:44,900
Guys, we're never gonna look at the menu.

1097
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,980
Okay, okay.

1098
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,560
Guys, okay, we're gonna...

1099
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,260
Guys, give me a sec.

1100
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:54,960
I'm gonna...

1101
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:59,080
Guys, this just launched, guys.

1102
00:55:59,360 --> 00:55:59,720
Okay?

1103
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,700
Guys, let me...

1104
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:03,420
Guys, okay.

1105
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,420
This game...

1106
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,940
This game just launched, okay?

1107
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,480
Please, please be kind.

1108
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,860
Okay, I'm gonna lower the BGM and...

1109
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,220
And the effects so we can up the...

1110
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:23,660
So we can up the overall sound with the game volume.

1111
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:24,460
Okay, let's see.

1112
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:26,980
I upped the voice volume to 100.

1113
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,080
And then I'm gonna up the...

1114
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,760
I'm gonna up the sound a little bit too.

1115
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,000
Alright, here we go.

1116
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:35,640
Alright, there we go.

1117
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,480
Alright, we're just never gonna look at the menu.

1118
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,280
What can I buy?

1119
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,260
Strength Serum?

1120
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,540
And I can sell stuff too.

1121
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,420
Oh, I can sell the Raptor Scale!

1122
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,180
Oh, it has the Strength of Metals?

1123
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:51,640
Okay.

1124
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,440
Sending your hospital bills...

1125
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,660
Sending your hospital bills to Doki.

1126
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:56,980
Thank you for the super chat.

1127
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,780
Thank you, thank you.

1128
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,920
I can't believe humans actually managed to live here until recently.

1129
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:04,000
How's the volume now, guys?

1130
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,720
There's no place like home.

1131
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,200
That means they must have had an even more powerful reason to leave.

1132
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,500
You know what that guy sounds like?

1133
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,060
The sheriff?

1134
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:18,220
He sounds like the new mayor from Family Guy.

1135
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,600
The one that replaced Adam West.

1136
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:25,040
Can I beat up a bird?

1137
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:25,820
Here we go.

1138
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,300
Alright, there you go.

1139
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,240
Let's see.

1140
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:35,700
We gotta go this way.

1141
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,160
Weeeeee.

1142
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,860
Wait, why can't I drive over here?

1143
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,720
What gear?

1144
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,220
I'm gonna put on autopilot.

1145
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,480
Guys, this is autopilot.

1146
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,480
Guys, that was autopilot.

1147
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:56,920
Guys.

1148
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:57,840
Guys.

1149
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,240
Okay, autopilot just makes you drive straight.

1150
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:02,120
I've learned what autopilot is.

1151
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,380
Let's head for that stone arch.

1152
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:05,920
Taubo's just beyond it.

1153
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,700
Yeah, it's about time.

1154
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,140
Alright.

1155
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,420
Oh my god, autopilot is literally just drive straight.

1156
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:18,640
Wait, I can't run over... I can run over a dog.

1157
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:19,260
Not dog.

1158
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:23,600
A dinosaur, but I can't run over... Oh, I can.

1159
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:24,220
Never mind.

1160
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,680
I just need more... I just need more speed.

1161
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,140
Yay!

1162
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,660
1 XP.

1163
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:35,440
I was gonna say, was it really better in the old days?

1164
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,620
Good question.

1165
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,360
The world's taken a turn for the worse, sure.

1166
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:42,400
Wait, Luke!

1167
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,460
But humans had plenty of problems back then, too.

1168
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:46,260
Luke!

1169
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,760
Perhaps so.

1170
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,380
But we were never half as cruel as you demons.

1171
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,500
What the fuck did we demons do?

1172
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:55,080
We might play tricks on people, but we don't kill.

1173
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,720
We don't kill?

1174
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:58,660
Oh, I killed...

1175
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,220
Yeah, guys, I did not kill, guys.

1176
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,300
Humanity has always loved to blame us for it.

1177
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,720
Those bugs never existed.

1178
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,340
Guys, look at what they said.

1179
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,760
They said I don't kill, guys.

1180
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,940
They said I don't kill.

1181
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:28,180
Wait, is the voice volume better now?

1182
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:29,520
Or is the overall sound better?

1183
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:30,180
Chat?

1184
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:31,440
Just wanna be sure.

1185
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,280
Okay.

1186
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,040
Guys, I didn't kill, guys.

1187
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:39,980
Those bugs are just in the hospital with like a broken leg, guys.

1188
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,580
Oh my god, there's green dinosaurs!

1189
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,920
Oh my god, they have babies, too!

1190
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,280
Oh my god, it's a mom-dad!

1191
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:50,820
Oh!

1192
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,420
Don't worry, I'm only here for the babies.

1193
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,180
For all the other orphaned dinos.

1194
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,660
I'm gonna create...

1195
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,140
I need to create families that need babies to adopt all the other orphans.

1196
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:05,980
I am do...

1197
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:06,800
Oh, she...

1198
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,080
This mom has triplets!

1199
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,540
Okay.

1200
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,540
Give me a sec.

1201
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,480
No!

1202
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:13,540
I killed the mom!

1203
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:14,960
No!

1204
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,000
Okay, now I have to find...

1205
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,120
Now I have to find a single... single mom to adopt these babies.

1206
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,020
I created orphans.

1207
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,440
I can't believe I've done the one...

1208
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:27,760
Okay, we're gonna leave one survivor.

1209
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,640
No, we can't have any survivor or they're gonna do a revenge on us.

1210
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:31,200
There's no revenge plot on me.

1211
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,560
It's time to end the bloodline, now.

1212
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:35,860
So there's no revenge plots.

1213
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:36,880
There.

1214
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,840
There were no orphans.

1215
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,060
There were no orphans.

1216
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:43,860
What do you mean?

1217
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,360
No witnesses, guys.

1218
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,760
No witnesses!

1219
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:47,920
What did you say is true?

1220
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,520
Perhaps, we have misunderstood you.

1221
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:52,820
Now, hold on!

1222
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,740
Don't get the wrong idea!

1223
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,020
Alpha Raptor!

1224
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:58,320
Where?

1225
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,760
Is that him?

1226
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,260
Oh shit!

1227
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:09,940
Guys, oh my god, it's the king of all- it's the king of all- all dragons.

1228
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,520
Am I doing any damage to the alpha raptor?

1229
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,380
I don't know, I can't tell.

1230
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:22,720
What?

1231
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,480
It was in war, yes.

1232
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:27,960
But killing is killing.

1233
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:28,960
Here we go.

1234
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:30,660
Alright, we're gonna kill the alpha.

1235
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,220
Some serious stuff.

1236
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,600
Did I just chop off his tail?

1237
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,660
Oh my- he's okay!

1238
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:38,280
He's okay, he's still moving!

1239
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,080
Where's the alpha?

1240
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:40,560
Where is he?

1241
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,060
I'm gonna punch the alpha, Dano.

1242
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:42,820
Be careful, Prince.

1243
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:44,780
What's he gonna do?

1244
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:45,300
Punch me?

1245
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,100
Oh shit!

1246
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,820
I don't- I can't- are you- go!

1247
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,300
There's the alpha scorpion!

1248
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:52,900
What did you do?

1249
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:01,660
When an alpha scorpion and an alpha Dano love each other very much.

1250
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:04,060
Oh my god, imagine the babies they would make.

1251
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,380
It's love but one!

1252
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,900
How is that alpha?

1253
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,340
Do you think the thief will be okay?

1254
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:14,780
Okay.

1255
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,940
Oh, I don't have like a- Bro, you can- oh, you can!

1256
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,960
Okay, I was gonna say, where the fuck is the HP?

1257
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,920
You really cannot recommend fighting it unarmed.

1258
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:25,860
I'm gonna fight him!

1259
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:26,880
You can't stop me!

1260
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:28,080
Watch this!

1261
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:29,440
Oh!

1262
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,160
Okay, wait, don't watch it!

1263
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:32,660
Oh!

1264
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:36,340
Okay, okay, guys, guys!

1265
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:38,480
Guys, I realize...

1266
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:39,320
Guys...

1267
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:41,260
Not every...

1268
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,260
Guys, I realize...

1269
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:48,680
Not every Dano I can fight, guys.

1270
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:51,460
I just figured it out.

1271
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,500
That I should not take every fight, chat.

1272
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:56,200
I...

1273
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:56,920
I...

1274
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,100
There are some points in time when it's okay to run away.

1275
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,380
Alright, we have to go this way.

1276
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:06,960
Alright.

1277
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:08,800
This is where we have to go.

1278
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:09,960
Woop!

1279
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:12,460
Anyway, I did get to...

1280
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:13,340
Uh...

1281
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,880
Oh, on OBS remastering game, just bring it up a little small bit to round it out.

1282
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:18,900
Okay, guys, close your eyes.

1283
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:20,020
Close your eyes, guys.

1284
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,040
Close your eyes real quick, guys.

1285
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,240
Okay.

1286
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,800
Speedrun.

1287
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:32,660
Where?

1288
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:38,860
There's a baby all by himself.

1289
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:52,680
Hehehehehe.

1290
01:03:57,700 --> 01:03:58,960
Where's the bandit symbol?

1291
01:03:59,100 --> 01:03:59,780
I wanna go there.

1292
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,700
Where's the bandit symbol?

1293
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:07,400
I wanna go to the bandit...

1294
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,260
Oh, shit!

1295
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:09,660
There's a raptor cave!

1296
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:13,560
Wait,

1297
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:20,270
there's a rock here.

1298
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:21,310
Can I beat up the rock?

1299
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,350
Am I strong enough yet?

1300
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:25,970
No.

1301
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:27,690
I'm not strong enough yet.

1302
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:31,190
Alright, guys.

1303
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:32,570
There's still a point.

1304
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:38,050
Why am I in this raptor cave if I can't fucking beat up the... beat up the rock?

1305
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:40,090
Karma's coming.

1306
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:40,930
What's that?

1307
01:04:44,290 --> 01:04:44,770
Karma?

1308
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,170
I don't think I've ever heard of that word before.

1309
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:48,790
Woop.

1310
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:49,270
Woop.

1311
01:04:50,330 --> 01:04:52,050
Oh my god, wait, they're red scorpions.

1312
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:53,570
Inbound!

1313
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,850
First one in ten days.

1314
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:00,310
What the heck just...

1315
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:03,490
All four tires punctured.

1316
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:05,450
Oh, we are so unlucky.

1317
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,450
Have at them, boys.

1318
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:09,730
Go rob and blast.

1319
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:14,110
And if they resist, feel free to offer.

1320
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:17,710
I take it you punks are responsible?

1321
01:05:19,130 --> 01:05:20,030
What the...

1322
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:28,110
Guys, I think we're in the wrong part of town, guys.

1323
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:32,390
I don't think they're just bandits, guys.

1324
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,930
Are we kink-shaming them, Prince?

1325
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:42,430
They look fabulous.

1326
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,350
Okay, we're gonna get these guys out.

1327
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:50,230
Yay, we did it.

1328
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:52,650
It's okay, they like that.

1329
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:54,190
Guys, they like that.

1330
01:05:54,670 --> 01:05:57,470
You can tell by their outfits, they really like it.

1331
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:04,710
Press RT to do an evasive action and dodge an enemy attack.

1332
01:06:04,850 --> 01:06:08,810
Use RT to move in the direction to evade it.

1333
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:09,050
Okay.

1334
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:10,370
Oh, nice.

1335
01:06:10,510 --> 01:06:11,190
I did that.

1336
01:06:11,470 --> 01:06:12,290
Oh, fuck!

1337
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:12,890
Okay.

1338
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:18,370
Oh my gosh, if only I was full HP and I didn't waste all of that on...

1339
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:20,390
Yes.

1340
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:24,390
If only I didn't waste my HP on that raptor.

1341
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:29,650
Please, will you help?

1342
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:31,590
Are you... Is this all he does?

1343
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,070
Does he just cheer me on?

1344
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:40,390
Okay, I definitely messed up by using all my HP for that one fucking raptor.

1345
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:48,620
Okay, he does like two, three... a delay on the third.

1346
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,140
Oh.

1347
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:51,760
That's fucking right.

1348
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,360
I'm gonna Bowser you.

1349
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,320
Oh!

1350
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,600
You're gonna do another swing, right?

1351
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:00,660
Oh no, he's not.

1352
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,220
And he has like one delayed.

1353
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:06,380
Oh my god, look at that!

1354
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,200
I have no patterns!

1355
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,900
You have a gun, Sheriff!

1356
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:11,000
Use your gun!

1357
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:17,030
What?!

1358
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:18,610
He has a gun?!

1359
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,690
I'll show you what I'm packing!

1360
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:22,930
That's the gun, right?

1361
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,490
Nobody's allowed to be more evil than a fiend.

1362
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:39,640
Still kicking, old timer?

1363
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,480
Yeah, thanks to you.

1364
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:50,340
Never would have believed just how strong fiends are if I hadn't seen it for myself.

1365
01:07:51,460 --> 01:07:52,240
Oh, please.

1366
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:52,920
Those guys?

1367
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:53,780
They were nothing.

1368
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:56,540
Yeah, they should have started off with a gun.

1369
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,160
Then maybe I would have a problem.

1370
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,340
By the way, Sheriff, it seems like you also have a gun.

1371
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,560
Guys, this is why I should have taken the centaur.

1372
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:12,240
I feel like the centaur would have actually helped me in that fight.

1373
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,960
We've no choice but to walk it to Talbot.

1374
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:16,980
It's not far.

1375
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,080
Aww, are you serious?

1376
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:23,640
Oh, for the... I can't believe this.

1377
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:25,640
No!

1378
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:26,680
Our car!

1379
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,680
You can see it.

1380
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,220
Who am I gonna run over?

1381
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,780
How am I gonna run over people this time?

1382
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:34,800
Alright.

1383
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:37,980
I can't believe it.

1384
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:38,740
Oh god.

1385
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:39,220
Okay.

1386
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,120
Beezlebutt's friends earn skill points upon leveling them.

1387
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,760
Once you level up, open... Okay, guys.

1388
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:47,940
This might be a little bit of an issue.

1389
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,480
Oh, I got ally skills!

1390
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,820
They're gonna actually help!

1391
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,900
I open up ally skill ring with LB.

1392
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,220
Passive skills take action to...

1393
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,060
Oh my god!

1394
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,620
You guys are actually gonna help!

1395
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:04,120
Power of Darkness.

1396
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,240
He has a vacuum.

1397
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:13,860
Beezlebutt accumulates power of darkness when dealing damage to enemies or enemies.

1398
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,060
Use the power to dish out special kit skills.

1399
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,540
Use RB to view the skill ring menu.

1400
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,920
Then press key for a special attack you wish to unleash.

1401
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,060
RB to unleash a special combo in front of you.

1402
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:28,920
Oh, okay.

1403
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:29,900
I learned...

1404
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,220
Okay.

1405
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,200
I learned a special attack.

1406
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:35,480
Rush.

1407
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,660
How's this?

1408
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:38,820
Oh, shit!

1409
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:39,680
Okay, that looks cool.

1410
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:42,160
Alright, there's... I have Rush and then...

1411
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,800
Oh, I can like zoom out of the map.

1412
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:44,440
Like this.

1413
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:45,620
Okay.

1414
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:47,720
Uh... Alright.

1415
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,200
Oh, yes!

1416
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:50,800
We fixed it!

1417
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,280
I don't know how!

1418
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:54,160
But we fixed it.

1419
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,240
Okay, we're gonna learn... this.

1420
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:59,640
We have new finishing move.

1421
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:01,540
Press B during the combo to keep attacking.

1422
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,140
Alright, what about...

1423
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:05,560
What about our allies?

1424
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,820
Spoilers award chances of obtaining additional items from defeating enemies.

1425
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,840
Use this to insert their closing in and knock them out.

1426
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:14,260
Okay.

1427
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:17,120
I feel like we need more items.

1428
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:19,880
I did it!

1429
01:10:19,980 --> 01:10:21,120
I fixed it, guys!

1430
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:22,920
I did it!

1431
01:10:24,740 --> 01:10:26,000
Alright, let's see.

1432
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,000
Uh...

1433
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:28,760
Okay.

1434
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:30,140
Uh...

1435
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,300
What's it like in Talbo?

1436
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:35,940
It's a former mining town.

1437
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,580
Not as well off as it once was.

1438
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,980
But still the biggest town around these parts.

1439
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:42,480
Hmm...

1440
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,560
That's where they have the Aquanium mine, isn't it?

1441
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:48,780
Or what's left of it.

1442
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,760
Oh, hey, there is!

1443
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:50,580
There's ores here!

1444
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,700
Can I beat up the rocks?

1445
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,240
I can beat up the rocks!

1446
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:55,080
Aquanium veins tapped out.

1447
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,540
Mines be shoved.

1448
01:10:57,540 --> 01:10:58,360
Oh my god!

1449
01:10:58,500 --> 01:10:59,660
Of course you used it all up.

1450
01:10:59,860 --> 01:11:01,020
I can beat up the rocks!

1451
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:02,960
Humans never know when to stop, do you?

1452
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,380
I say as I'm mining the resources.

1453
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,340
Yeah, humans!

1454
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,900
Those goddamn humans don't know when to stop!

1455
01:11:11,900 --> 01:11:13,040
Over mining!

1456
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:15,800
Oh, hey old man!

1457
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:16,880
Is that the town?

1458
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:20,760
Yes, that's Talbo.

1459
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,300
Now, you two should wait here.

1460
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,900
It'll cause havoc if people see demons wandering around town.

1461
01:11:31,180 --> 01:11:32,180
I'll go on my own.

1462
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,340
Wait, we need water and food, right?

1463
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:37,160
Yeah!

1464
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:40,920
Thiefs can just steal them for free.

1465
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,440
Yeah, we don't have to spend money.

1466
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,200
Huh?

1467
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,100
That is why you're here, thief!

1468
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,920
No, that's all right.

1469
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,180
As a sheriff, I can't condone.

1470
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,160
But you're okay with murder?

1471
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,100
Oh, sorry, not murder.

1472
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:01,320
Sorry, demons don't murder, guys.

1473
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,520
It's just injuring them.

1474
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,720
You have the costume, right?

1475
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:11,800
The costume?

1476
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,200
Yes, of course.

1477
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:14,820
Of course, prince.

1478
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,580
I never leave home without it.

1479
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:19,400
What's the costume?

1480
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:23,920
What the fuck?

1481
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:25,240
Is that Santa?

1482
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:30,400
Oh, this is murder on my hairstyle.

1483
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,000
What's that supposed to...

1484
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:41,020
Even if I get caught, I can just talk my way out as long as I'm wearing this.

1485
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:43,840
See ya!

1486
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,300
Oh, no, this is not...

1487
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:52,600
I don't know, the bright red doesn't seem like very thief, you know, thief camouflage-y.

1488
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:55,780
The ultimate costume.

1489
01:12:59,040 --> 01:12:59,680
Huh?

1490
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,400
Is that a...

1491
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,020
Oh, I got blonde Bulma!

1492
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:04,860
It is.

1493
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:06,280
A motorcycle.

1494
01:13:08,200 --> 01:13:10,100
Looks like it's in good condition.

1495
01:13:10,100 --> 01:13:11,400
We can always trust Santa.

1496
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,640
I'll use this to make my escape.

1497
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,220
Alright then.

1498
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:20,560
Now to get what I came here for in the first place.

1499
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:23,800
Steal the bike.

1500
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,740
Do it!

1501
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:25,440
Steal the wheels!

1502
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:28,220
These will do nicely for provisions.

1503
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,760
We could've stole the wheels!

1504
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,480
There's plenty more for the taking.

1505
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,840
Car jacket!

1506
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,720
Okay, I'll grab what I need and head back.

1507
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,170
Get food and water in town.

1508
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:45,830
Alright.

1509
01:13:48,410 --> 01:13:50,650
If you're a spy by then you'll instantly fail the mission.

1510
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:51,710
Keep your head down.

1511
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:54,030
Pick up the food and water provision by holding Y.

1512
01:13:54,650 --> 01:13:57,270
While sneaking with RT, symbols will appear.

1513
01:13:57,750 --> 01:13:59,370
Okay, I need to...

1514
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:01,890
Alright.

1515
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:03,910
We'll grab this.

1516
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:07,670
Yay!

1517
01:14:08,170 --> 01:14:09,890
We're gonna be fed now!

1518
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:14,810
Well, I should just about do it for this month's tax.

1519
01:14:15,010 --> 01:14:15,970
What about the water?

1520
01:14:17,130 --> 01:14:18,310
But we're thirsty!

1521
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,330
Everything I work for gets taken by the Royal Army.

1522
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,450
I like how that's like... is it the Red Army?

1523
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:32,070
Oh, sounds like these supplies are earmarked for the Royal Army.

1524
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:37,510
Okay, he needs to pay taxes.

1525
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:38,750
Yeah, demon taxes.

1526
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:40,470
Now he doesn't trouble me one bit.

1527
01:14:40,670 --> 01:14:42,670
Take everything you can get, I say.

1528
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:44,370
Ship.

1529
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:47,190
I just like walk this way and then walk around.

1530
01:14:47,430 --> 01:14:49,270
Still haven't found enough food and water.

1531
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:50,950
Better keep looking.

1532
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:54,250
You mean X.

1533
01:14:54,270 --> 01:14:56,150
Still haven't found enough food and water.

1534
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:57,770
Better keep looking.

1535
01:14:58,150 --> 01:14:58,850
Don't worry.

1536
01:15:01,650 --> 01:15:03,930
I make my own...

1537
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:07,170
I make my own pathways.

1538
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,170
At this rate, I'll be done in no time.

1539
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:12,690
Yeah, it's like the Red Ribbon Army.

1540
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:15,570
But like instead it's the Royal Army instead.

1541
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:17,370
Moo?

1542
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:18,770
Moo?

1543
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:19,410
What?

1544
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,360
What's this cow doing?

1545
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:25,100
Cow me?

1546
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:26,680
Bororo cattle.

1547
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,600
They scared my boots off.

1548
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,760
Looks like good eating.

1549
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,260
Alright, you're off the meat hook.

1550
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:36,900
I've got places to be.

1551
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:39,820
I've got places to be.

1552
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:42,400
What the fuck?

1553
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:43,880
He was watching me.

1554
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:46,520
He was a voyeur.

1555
01:15:46,940 --> 01:15:48,700
I like how I don't even need to sneak.

1556
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:50,500
I can just like walk around.

1557
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:53,420
Oh shit, wait.

1558
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,220
It's alright, she's not gonna turn around.

1559
01:15:58,780 --> 01:15:59,620
Don't worry guys.

1560
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:01,680
She was never gonna turn around anyway.

1561
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:02,500
I'm late.

1562
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:06,540
At times like this, you Bororo are such a comfort.

1563
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:09,360
I'm late.

1564
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,060
Slifter than a lullaby.

1565
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:15,000
Oh my god, blonde Bulma.

1566
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:18,820
Spino?

1567
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,160
You have to go south.

1568
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,600
It's hard to spot.

1569
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,360
Surrounded by mountains.

1570
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,000
I'm Spider Santa.

1571
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,400
What do you want with that desolate old place?

1572
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,540
Don't wanna hear her voice.

1573
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:36,900
Nice.

1574
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,360
BOMA 18.

1575
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:50,880
You can tell cause she's the only woman in this area with like colored hair.

1576
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:52,640
Instead of black hair.

1577
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:56,400
Alright, where's the other one?

1578
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,140
Oh, it's over here.

1579
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,060
It's not like they can hear me.

1580
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:00,880
Hahahaha!

1581
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,900
I don't need to sneak.

1582
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:03,820
I can just run.

1583
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,040
Run!

1584
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:18,800
Oh my god, we can steal the tanks!

1585
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,260
Wow!

1586
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:38,900
You don't know that!

1587
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:41,580
Yeah!

1588
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,280
Beat him up!

1589
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:46,160
I can't believe he would assume that!

1590
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:58,680
I can't believe he just assumed that she can't fix it!

1591
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,460
That's so fucked up!

1592
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:04,940
Oh, there's a dog!

1593
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:07,060
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

1594
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:10,400
Never punished.

1595
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:11,280
Let's go!

1596
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:15,300
Don't need to sneak around.

1597
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:16,240
I can just run.

1598
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,460
Where is Spino?

1599
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:42,460
Voice actress, can you make it sound like your old... the typical, generic old voice?

1600
01:18:42,660 --> 01:18:45,840
I hear it's been deserted ever since the royals stormed it decades ago.

1601
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,020
Huh, what brings her there?

1602
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:51,960
Don't know.

1603
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:54,760
Strikes me as odd, though.

1604
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,960
You think she could be up to no good or something?

1605
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:05,760
Hmm... Don't know what harm she could do there if she tried.

1606
01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:10,840
Nothing of interest to us here.

1607
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,360
Yeah, we don't need to go to Spino.

1608
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,100
Unless there's more gear there.

1609
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:17,340
Yeah!

1610
01:19:17,480 --> 01:19:18,840
I got food and water!

1611
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:19,820
Perfect!

1612
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:21,480
Plenty of food and water here.

1613
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,340
Generic old lady voice 01.

1614
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,560
Should be more than enough for us.

1615
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:29,720
That booze about the tank is the most valuable piece of this haul, though.

1616
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:32,040
Yay!

1617
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,560
Yay!

1618
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,160
Better get going.

1619
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,060
Prince is waiting for me.

1620
01:19:37,680 --> 01:19:40,160
Hey, she does look like the Red Ribbon Army.

1621
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:41,480
Even the uniforms.

1622
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:47,020
Got our requisitions?

1623
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,940
Yeah, but they seem kinda light.

1624
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:54,760
Yeah, but they seem kinda light.

1625
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:55,200
Hey!

1626
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,280
Haven't seen you around here before.

1627
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:57,400
Hey!

1628
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:57,460
Haven't seen you around here before.

1629
01:19:57,460 --> 01:19:57,900
Yeah, it was her.

1630
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,620
She stole all the food and water.

1631
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:01,840
Wait, why are you here?

1632
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,860
She's got something to hide.

1633
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:04,640
Arrest her!

1634
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:07,680
Stop!

1635
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,000
Yeah, you can tell I'm part of you guys.

1636
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,040
I also have red.

1637
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,160
What the fuck?

1638
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:19,200
It just has two wheels.

1639
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,520
Wait, what?

1640
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:21,880
What is that car?

1641
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:25,820
Well, looks like I'll be walking around.

1642
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:26,900
What kind of car is that?

1643
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:30,580
Wait!

1644
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:32,280
It just had two wheels!

1645
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,620
Did you see that?

1646
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:39,420
It just works!

1647
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:40,400
It just works!

1648
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:41,360
It just works!

1649
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,080
A car motorcycle!

1650
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:47,300
You're back already?

1651
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:48,580
You work fast.

1652
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,660
Not just fast, but talented.

1653
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:55,980
I got us some invaluable information.

1654
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,080
Apparently, the army's got tanks sitting at its base.

1655
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,860
Whoa, tanks?

1656
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:05,760
Awesome!

1657
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,200
We gotta steal it!

1658
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,340
This whole game is about a tank!

1659
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,440
We still haven't got the tank part!

1660
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,120
Hold on there.

1661
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:16,580
That's a whole lot easier said than done.

1662
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:20,760
Hey, we need some car or other.

1663
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:23,720
I'm not going all the way to the legendary spring on foot.

1664
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:26,960
Hmm...

1665
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,280
Well, we might as well check out this base.

1666
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:32,960
Maybe we'll think of something.

1667
01:21:34,540 --> 01:21:36,140
So, the tank is still a rumor?

1668
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,200
Has it yet to be real?

1669
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:41,140
Look, I saw the game cover and I was on a tank.

1670
01:21:41,380 --> 01:21:43,040
So, that has to be real.

1671
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,900
Your water supply points scatter around every area.

1672
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:49,540
Hold Y at a water supply point to refill your HP and water gauge.

1673
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:53,780
By refilling at a water supply point, you won't be able to use it again for a period of time.

1674
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:54,300
Okay.

1675
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,600
So, like this?

1676
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:56,360
Where is this map's base anyway?

1677
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,820
It's eastward of here.

1678
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,100
Yay!

1679
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:02,400
I'm healthy again.

1680
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:03,480
Can I beat up a cow?

1681
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,440
We'd best scout the area first.

1682
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:06,920
No!

1683
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:09,120
They know what I want to do!

1684
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:14,920
Let me touch the cows!

1685
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:20,600
Not fair!

1686
01:22:23,540 --> 01:22:25,840
What if I want to touch the cow?

1687
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,420
I want to pet him!

1688
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:31,060
I won't do anything else!

1689
01:22:31,100 --> 01:22:32,680
I wasn't going to punch him!

1690
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:35,320
I swear!

1691
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:37,960
I was not going to punch a cow!

1692
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:40,900
Okay, let's go to the main objective.

1693
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,580
No cow hugs!

1694
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,680
Alright, so you guys want to know what it sounds like?

1695
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:47,800
Yeah, I'm curious too.

1696
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:49,420
Can I change it?

1697
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,860
Oh, I can't.

1698
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:52,260
Okay.

1699
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,080
Oh well, guys.

1700
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:53,840
I guess...

1701
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:54,720
Wait, let's see.

1702
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:56,060
Message size.

1703
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,720
Let's have it big, actually.

1704
01:22:59,020 --> 01:23:02,840
I feel like we should have the message size big.

1705
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:04,620
I was wondering if I could change the...

1706
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,840
Change it here for...

1707
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:09,940
Oh god, sorry guys.

1708
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,640
Change the Japanese here.

1709
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:33,660
Yeah.

1710
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,420
We don't care about those people.

1711
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:42,980
What?

1712
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:45,700
It's like taxes!

1713
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,500
Sorry, I can't beat up those...

1714
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,080
I can't beat up those raptors.

1715
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,380
Guys, we have to do this together, guys!

1716
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:57,800
Guys!

1717
01:23:58,660 --> 01:23:59,720
Come on, guys!

1718
01:23:59,980 --> 01:24:00,860
Let's do this together!

1719
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:09,660
Guys, did you not remember when I said we got to bust this together as a team?

1720
01:24:09,900 --> 01:24:10,120
What?

1721
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:22,790
I like the tin hats.

1722
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:27,330
I feel like the holes just make this like...

1723
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:29,750
Make it not useful.

1724
01:24:37,470 --> 01:24:40,090
It's not as practical with the holes in the helmet.

1725
01:24:42,810 --> 01:24:43,570
Oops, sorry.

1726
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:50,210
Alright.

1727
01:24:54,450 --> 01:24:55,430
I wanna...

1728
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:56,410
Wait, where's the...

1729
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:58,250
Where's the...

1730
01:24:58,250 --> 01:24:59,610
Did it TP me?

1731
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:02,070
Wait, it TP'd me.

1732
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:03,110
I was trying to mine.

1733
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:05,570
Where's the...

1734
01:25:05,570 --> 01:25:06,390
Oh, it did!

1735
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:07,670
I was like, where the fuck...

1736
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:10,850
Where the fuck were the rocks that I was trying to jump on?

1737
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:12,410
Right here, yeah.

1738
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:14,390
I can parkour this.

1739
01:25:14,490 --> 01:25:15,190
Watch this, guys.

1740
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:17,410
Wee!

1741
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:22,350
Okay, and then I guess this is where I stop parkouring.

1742
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:25,610
Nevermind.

1743
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:27,510
This is where the parkour stops.

1744
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:29,290
But what... Can I just beat them up, guys?

1745
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:30,110
I'm gonna go beat them up.

1746
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,590
I don't need another checkpoint.

1747
01:25:31,870 --> 01:25:32,690
Guys, watch this.

1748
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:35,790
Let me beat them up, Sheriff!

1749
01:25:36,650 --> 01:25:37,090
Please!

1750
01:25:39,450 --> 01:25:42,510
I can't punch anybody I want anymore!

1751
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:44,230
This is not fair!

1752
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:50,290
They won't let me punch people!

1753
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:52,630
Here we go!

1754
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:55,490
At least I can punch this.

1755
01:25:56,110 --> 01:25:58,250
If you hate the army so much, why not fight them?

1756
01:25:58,490 --> 01:25:59,130
Yeah!

1757
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:04,210
30 years ago, the whole rebel army dared to stand against them.

1758
01:26:04,890 --> 01:26:11,010
But the loyal army tore them to shreds and scattered its members to the...

1759
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,690
I'm gonna punch a bug because I'm angry.

1760
01:26:13,030 --> 01:26:13,410
How?

1761
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,130
They're really that strong, huh?

1762
01:26:16,570 --> 01:26:19,110
I can't wait to charge into their base!

1763
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:21,570
Your guns don't even hurt me!

1764
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:25,130
Not even a fiend can take them head on!

1765
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:26,210
You don't know that!

1766
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,930
I'm different!

1767
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:30,150
I like how they went from demon to fiend.

1768
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:31,610
Like, what's the difference?

1769
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:40,350
Violence is wrong, Doki.

1770
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:43,290
Oh, but you didn't stop me when I took the car...

1771
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:45,790
and ran it over bugs.

1772
01:26:48,310 --> 01:26:49,090
There's a tank!

1773
01:26:49,650 --> 01:26:51,650
I can't run over bugs with a tank!

1774
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:54,590
That's better than a car!

1775
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:56,990
Oh, I like it!

1776
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:58,150
Steal it for a thief?

1777
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:03,130
Do you realize what you're asking for?

1778
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,550
Alright, I'll do something about it.

1779
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:09,710
Uh, you?

1780
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:13,650
You're really sure it's okay for you to steal stuff?

1781
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:18,050
If it belongs to that lousy royal army, it's fair game in my book.

1782
01:27:20,590 --> 01:27:23,010
I'm not sure I can do anything about it.

1783
01:27:23,030 --> 01:27:25,450
We should be able to sneak in through the side entrance.

1784
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:29,070
Honestly, yeah.

1785
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:31,530
I feel like there should be more guards posted up.

1786
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:33,970
Hairspray?

1787
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:34,750
Hairspray?

1788
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:35,210
Yeah.

1789
01:27:35,590 --> 01:27:36,790
What are you going to do with that?

1790
01:27:37,170 --> 01:27:38,170
What are you going to do with Hairspray?

1791
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:40,130
I have an idea.

1792
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:41,450
Let's get closer.

1793
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:42,650
Don't get spotted.

1794
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:47,040
What's he going to do?

1795
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:51,320
Alright.

1796
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:52,980
Loot time!

1797
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,120
Look!

1798
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:56,240
Yay!

1799
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,700
Am I going the right way?

1800
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,600
I think I am.

1801
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:00,000
Oh!

1802
01:28:00,260 --> 01:28:01,080
Mining time!

1803
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:02,720
Yeah!

1804
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:03,400
Oars!

1805
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,860
I can't wait to customize my tank.

1806
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:07,380
It's going to look so fucking cool.

1807
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:12,420
Oh, there's no fall damage!

1808
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,840
That's my favorite part.

1809
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:18,020
I see.

1810
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,080
Lucky for us.

1811
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,660
How's the sheriff going to...

1812
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:27,340
How's the sheriff going to use his Hairspray?

1813
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:37,550
Okay.

1814
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:42,810
Then what?

1815
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,410
What happens, Prince?

1816
01:28:43,650 --> 01:28:45,330
You sneak in from the side.

1817
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:47,290
What?

1818
01:28:47,290 --> 01:28:48,330
Why me?

1819
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:51,450
Go be a decoy yourself if that's what you want.

1820
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:53,970
I'm game.

1821
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:54,570
Let's go!

1822
01:28:55,590 --> 01:28:57,110
As long as I can punch.

1823
01:28:57,370 --> 01:29:01,550
You're far too willing to let this human take the reigns at every turn.

1824
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,230
I'll zip it.

1825
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:06,510
Unless you got a better idea...

1826
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:08,950
Then it's decided.

1827
01:29:22,250 --> 01:29:23,310
Yeah, old man!

1828
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:27,550
I'm the boy prince!

1829
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,560
What the fuck is he doing?

1830
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:37,840
It's like a smoke bomb.

1831
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:39,320
Oh, they're gonna think it's a smoke bomb.

1832
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:48,440
Okay, that's good.

1833
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:51,640
Run!

1834
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:00,280
Okay, I was gonna say, why are they still in it?

1835
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,640
That is actually so smart.

1836
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:28,070
Who actually just said- Look, guys!

1837
01:30:28,290 --> 01:30:29,790
The world's a mess right now.

1838
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:32,770
I don't think there's like school anymore in this world.

1839
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:36,730
I'd be surprised if they can read or write.

1840
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:42,070
Exploring military bases, be careful not to get spotted by soldiers.

1841
01:30:42,290 --> 01:30:46,090
Running or making noise will alert them, so make sure to move slowly and quietly when near soldiers.

1842
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:46,630
Okay.

1843
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:48,210
Is this considered running?

1844
01:30:51,970 --> 01:30:54,470
Better keep a low profile till we've joined up again.

1845
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:56,750
Okay, that's not considered running.

1846
01:30:56,830 --> 01:30:57,670
Okay, that's good to know.

1847
01:30:58,550 --> 01:30:59,570
I wasn't sure.

1848
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:02,710
Sneak up from behind and use Y to perform a stealth attack.

1849
01:31:03,050 --> 01:31:06,170
This will take your enemy out without alerting others.

1850
01:31:06,410 --> 01:31:08,870
Self-attacks to get rid of enemies blocking your way.

1851
01:31:08,930 --> 01:31:11,730
Hold LT which allows you to move slowly and silently.

1852
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:14,970
Sorry, that was RT.

1853
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:21,750
Oh, what?

1854
01:31:23,190 --> 01:31:24,150
Guys, he's okay.

1855
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:28,250
Guys, he's gonna be okay, guys.

1856
01:31:28,410 --> 01:31:32,510
I didn't scare him to death because murder's wrong for the demons, apparently.

1857
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,540
Let's see.

1858
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:48,140
I feel like if you're a soldier and you can die from just pure fear, then I don't think you should be a soldier.

1859
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:50,680
Parkour!

1860
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,120
We don't murder here, guys.

1861
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:54,100
That's a lie.

1862
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,460
We don't cross, apparently.

1863
01:31:55,700 --> 01:31:56,640
Or cannibalism.

1864
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:00,620
Murder and cannibalism is like the line for the demons.

1865
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,340
We want people to die by natural causes.

1866
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:05,660
Like fear.

1867
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:08,380
Fear is natural.

1868
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:13,840
They got the yellow... Oh my god, there's the yellow paint!

1869
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:16,600
That's why I knew where to go, guys.

1870
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:21,220
Even the ladders are yellow.

1871
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:22,320
Oh, guys.

1872
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:24,340
This is why I knew where to go.

1873
01:32:24,340 --> 01:32:26,920
I didn't even notice it.

1874
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,460
I was just... It was subconscious.

1875
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:31,220
The yellow paint was so subconscious.

1876
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,020
I was like, I see yellow, I go.

1877
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:36,440
Even the markers are yellow!

1878
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:38,820
Oh my god!

1879
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,100
What?!

1880
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,980
Oh, now they spot me after everything I did!

1881
01:32:45,780 --> 01:32:47,020
Oops, they saw me.

1882
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,860
Gotta be more careful.

1883
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:49,960
No, I don't.

1884
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:52,720
What the fuck?

1885
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:55,180
Oh.

1886
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:57,920
Alright, I'm gonna scare this guy to death too.

1887
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:00,600
Boo!

1888
01:33:02,060 --> 01:33:05,680
Fucking... These are the worst soldiers here, not gonna lie.

1889
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,720
These have to be... What the fuck?!

1890
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:09,740
I saw a loon!

1891
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:11,740
I want... I got greedy!

1892
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:13,560
I got greedy!

1893
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,560
Oops, they saw me.

1894
01:33:16,040 --> 01:33:17,000
Gotta be more careful.

1895
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,200
I got so greedy!

1896
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,820
Anyway, I'm coming back in.

1897
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,300
Not gonna stop me.

1898
01:33:30,030 --> 01:33:31,790
There's like a guy right here.

1899
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:35,270
There's like a guy right here.

1900
01:33:35,330 --> 01:33:35,850
Oh...

1901
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:36,350
No!

1902
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,610
Wait, is it... Did I loot this already?

1903
01:33:41,430 --> 01:33:42,430
Did I loot it?

1904
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:44,930
Guys, it's a speedrun, guys.

1905
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:47,430
Guys... What the fuck?!

1906
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,940
Guys, it was a speedrun.

1907
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:57,620
Because I already looted... It got looted.

1908
01:33:58,900 --> 01:34:01,220
So I don't have to do it again, guys.

1909
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,300
I did that on purpose, because I already looted that area.

1910
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:06,800
So now I don't have to loot it again, guys.

1911
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:08,100
Speedrun.

1912
01:34:10,060 --> 01:34:11,240
You didn't see me, right?

1913
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:13,520
No, you didn't.

1914
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:14,060
Alright, nice.

1915
01:34:16,100 --> 01:34:16,980
Oh, nice!

1916
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:18,400
There's an opening!

1917
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:18,880
Oh, nice!

1918
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:18,880
There's an opening!

1919
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,540
I did it.

1920
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:24,000
I'm so good at stealth chat.

1921
01:34:25,020 --> 01:34:25,460
Alright.

1922
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,780
I didn't get caught!

1923
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:31,700
Where's your proof?

1924
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:36,380
If I get caught, you would have... I would have had a game over, but I did it!

1925
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:39,180
Where am I?

1926
01:34:41,320 --> 01:34:43,240
Oh my god, this is a fucking maze.

1927
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:44,600
I'm so confused.

1928
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:50,480
Hey, did you hear?

1929
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,560
There was a big uproar at the gate.

1930
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,620
Even the opening is yellow!

1931
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:57,660
Yeah, I heard.

1932
01:34:58,020 --> 01:35:00,400
Man, today was just packed, wasn't it?

1933
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:03,200
What's that?

1934
01:35:03,420 --> 01:35:04,920
What was that plotline?

1935
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:07,520
Oh my god, look guys!

1936
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,540
Where do I go next?

1937
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,060
I wonder.

1938
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:10,700
Wait, but there's loot.

1939
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:13,020
Guys, sorry, but there's loot.

1940
01:35:13,120 --> 01:35:13,940
This is more important.

1941
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:15,780
No, get off the ladder.

1942
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:17,100
There's loot over there.

1943
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:18,600
Oh, they are sneaky.

1944
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:21,020
They are sneaky with this loot.

1945
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:22,380
Because it wasn't yellow.

1946
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:25,160
It wasn't yellow.

1947
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:26,620
They thought I didn't see it.

1948
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,320
They tried to distract me with the yellow.

1949
01:35:35,140 --> 01:35:36,580
Yo, the moon is yellow.

1950
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:37,700
We should go to the moon.

1951
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:39,640
Alright.

1952
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:44,640
Okay, let's go.

1953
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:48,180
I like how slow the crawl is though.

1954
01:35:48,700 --> 01:35:50,480
I think that's what I don't like about it.

1955
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:51,600
It's way too slow.

1956
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:52,800
Hey, did you hear?

1957
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,240
They captured some suspicious lady.

1958
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,080
Oh, it's blondeboma18!

1959
01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:03,700
Yeah, heard she had tons of maps, tools, water, but works.

1960
01:36:05,200 --> 01:36:07,140
Doesn't seem to be from around here.

1961
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:12,930
No, I missed the loot!

1962
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:14,610
Guys, guys.

1963
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,630
Oh, it's right there!

1964
01:36:17,130 --> 01:36:20,010
God, why did it make the loot box yellow?

1965
01:36:21,370 --> 01:36:23,530
It's like they don't want me to get it.

1966
01:36:23,690 --> 01:36:24,950
That's so fucked up.

1967
01:36:26,170 --> 01:36:27,770
Okay, I can't run.

1968
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:29,090
Alright.

1969
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:32,370
Yay, does this mean this door is open?

1970
01:36:32,450 --> 01:36:32,910
No, it's not.

1971
01:36:33,070 --> 01:36:34,690
Okay, I got B grade steel.

1972
01:36:36,390 --> 01:36:36,870
Alright.

1973
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:38,550
I love the yellow codes.

1974
01:36:38,810 --> 01:36:39,210
Hahaha!

1975
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:42,370
Hahaha!

1976
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,830
On!

1977
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:47,570
Okay, guys, I'm not going back.

1978
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:50,070
It's their fault for not making the loot box yellow.

1979
01:36:50,190 --> 01:36:51,670
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

1980
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:58,410
They can't just put all this yellow in my face and then not make the loot box yellow as well.

1981
01:36:59,090 --> 01:36:59,750
That's just...

1982
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:02,910
That's just them trying to make me not open the loot box.

1983
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:04,510
That's on them.

1984
01:37:04,730 --> 01:37:05,770
That's not my fault.

1985
01:37:07,890 --> 01:37:08,870
Oh my gosh, I can.

1986
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:12,730
This is just poor design.

1987
01:37:12,990 --> 01:37:13,430
AHHHHHHHH!

1988
01:37:13,470 --> 01:37:14,650
Don't climb onto the tank.

1989
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:15,990
Hahaha!

1990
01:37:17,130 --> 01:37:19,970
Anyway, as I was saying, that was just poor level design.

1991
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:22,690
Why did they make that yellow?

1992
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:23,810
Hahaha!

1993
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:29,210
I can't believe they made it blue.

1994
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:31,270
Oh my god.

1995
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:33,230
It's like they don't want me to succeed.

1996
01:37:34,230 --> 01:37:34,770
Hahaha!

1997
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:40,210
That should be like a brighter yellow so I know it's dangerous.

1998
01:37:42,310 --> 01:37:42,850
Hahaha!

1999
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:42,910
Hahaha!

2000
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:49,170
We're literally at their base.

2001
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:50,910
What do you mean they're everywhere?

2002
01:37:52,650 --> 01:37:54,150
Where do I go though?

2003
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:56,350
Where's the yellow?

2004
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:03,870
Oh.

2005
01:38:03,910 --> 01:38:04,610
No.

2006
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:05,850
No.

2007
01:38:07,630 --> 01:38:08,370
No.

2008
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:10,550
No.

2009
01:38:12,990 --> 01:38:13,730
Boo.

2010
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:19,050
Okay.

2011
01:38:19,210 --> 01:38:20,890
We gotta steal this.

2012
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:27,730
I don't think they see me from here.

2013
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:30,130
There's no way.

2014
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:31,990
I'm so far from the distance.

2015
01:38:32,490 --> 01:38:34,550
Oh, he went the other way too so that's okay.

2016
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:36,610
Alright, let's see.

2017
01:38:37,250 --> 01:38:37,970
We good?

2018
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:39,230
Alright.

2019
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,670
Here we go!

2020
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:42,670
Uh...

2021
01:38:42,670 --> 01:38:43,910
Go this way.

2022
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:45,390
Yeah!

2023
01:38:46,610 --> 01:38:47,290
Found it.

2024
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:49,590
Take!

2025
01:38:49,690 --> 01:38:50,150
Take!

2026
01:38:50,150 --> 01:38:50,450
Take!

2027
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:52,410
What's wrong with her?

2028
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:54,250
That little hellcat really laid into me.

2029
01:38:57,090 --> 01:38:59,270
Guess she's dead set on staying quiet.

2030
01:38:59,650 --> 01:39:01,950
No, it's his self esteem.

2031
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:03,290
Come on, let's get you in the med tank.

2032
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:04,250
To the med tank?

2033
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:04,750
Oh!

2034
01:39:04,910 --> 01:39:06,410
Because she punched him or something.

2035
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:08,030
I thought he was like...

2036
01:39:08,030 --> 01:39:08,830
What about the girl?

2037
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:15,330
I thought she like hurt him so badly emotionally and mentally that he had to go get like psychiatric help.

2038
01:39:15,750 --> 01:39:16,270
It's okay.

2039
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:35,740
Oh my god, it has eyes!

2040
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:36,760
That's so cute!

2041
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,000
Oh my god, it has eyes.

2042
01:39:46,780 --> 01:39:47,720
It's perfect!

2043
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:52,880
It's Engi!

2044
01:40:07,340 --> 01:40:08,000
What the fuck?

2045
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:08,660
How did they get here?

2046
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,020
Where did you guys come from?

2047
01:40:31,660 --> 01:40:32,340
Woman!

2048
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:51,400
Oh, you're a mechanic?

2049
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:52,900
We appreciate the offer.

2050
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:54,900
But who exactly are you?

2051
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:57,960
Can't these little details wait?

2052
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,300
Those grunts will be back any second.

2053
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,340
Hmm... We don't have the luxury of choice here.

2054
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,160
Prince, let's help her out.

2055
01:41:07,300 --> 01:41:10,400
At this point, we need that tank just to escape this base.

2056
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,740
We just follow the yellow back!

2057
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:17,760
We don't need the tank to escape!

2058
01:41:18,200 --> 01:41:19,840
I mean, how the fuck did you guys get in here?

2059
01:41:19,980 --> 01:41:20,980
Oh my god!

2060
01:41:22,040 --> 01:41:24,700
Enjoy my fancam of this lady!

2061
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:25,600
Hahaha!

2062
01:41:26,020 --> 01:41:26,500
Oh!

2063
01:41:30,300 --> 01:41:31,480
What the fuck was that?

2064
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:33,900
What was that?

2065
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:35,420
Cinematography?

2066
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:41,920
Legs!

2067
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,680
For what?

2068
01:41:55,480 --> 01:41:56,940
They don't have a new one, though.

2069
01:41:57,440 --> 01:41:59,800
Gonna have to jury-rig some old ones together.

2070
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,700
We're gonna MacGyver this shit!

2071
01:42:02,980 --> 01:42:03,000
What do you mean, MacGyver?

2072
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,300
Thanks, but this is nothing.

2073
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:08,180
The protagonist is short.

2074
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:11,760
Guys, it was just the... the Prince's POV, guys.

2075
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:12,260
Okay?

2076
01:42:12,300 --> 01:42:13,640
He had to look up.

2077
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:14,540
I thought you introduced yourselves.

2078
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:17,740
I'm Rao.

2079
01:42:17,940 --> 01:42:19,360
This here's Beelzebub.

2080
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:20,500
And Thief.

2081
01:42:21,260 --> 01:42:24,000
He did ecchi work before Dragon Ball?

2082
01:42:24,380 --> 01:42:27,420
This is the first time I've ever seen a demon face to face.

2083
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:27,620
What?

2084
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:34,800
It's like that one... that one manga artist that used to do, like, furry art.

2085
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:40,160
And... furry porn... before he became famous.

2086
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:45,720
Um, is it normal for you guys to run around with humans like this?

2087
01:42:48,460 --> 01:42:49,520
Absolutely not.

2088
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,780
Normally, I wouldn't be caught dead with the...

2089
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:53,500
Sorry, Gramps.

2090
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,280
Could you scooch for a sec?

2091
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:57,240
I have a name, thank you!

2092
01:42:58,620 --> 01:42:59,600
You guys didn't know?

2093
01:42:59,860 --> 01:43:01,120
I don't remember which one.

2094
01:43:01,260 --> 01:43:03,300
There was, like, a famous manga artist that...

2095
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,000
Maybe he was in the tank.

2096
01:43:05,420 --> 01:43:06,020
I don't know.

2097
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:07,380
He's supposed to get out of the base with it.

2098
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,200
If you look it up, you'll find it.

2099
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:14,060
They're already on alert for hostiles after that.

2100
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:15,000
Yeah, the... Oh, it's the Astro!

2101
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:15,380
Yeah, yeah!

2102
01:43:15,460 --> 01:43:18,160
The manga artist that created Astro Boy.

2103
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:18,840
Yeah!

2104
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:21,340
You can look up his old works.

2105
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,980
He was really into furry art.

2106
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:24,460
You two are in the tank.

2107
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:27,520
There we go.

2108
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:29,860
That should get us moving.

2109
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:33,200
Nice job.

2110
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:35,280
Your ability speaks for itself.

2111
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:39,880
So, do I hide in the tank too?

2112
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:42,600
And where does she sit?

2113
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,900
You're not gonna just leave me here, are you?

2114
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,400
It's true!

2115
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:56,680
He drew, like, naked furries.

2116
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:58,940
Those soldiers are coming.

2117
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,100
We've gotta go!

2118
01:44:02,540 --> 01:44:03,380
No!

2119
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,300
No choice.

2120
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:06,020
Climb in.

2121
01:44:09,100 --> 01:44:10,840
He's like, no crime!

2122
01:44:18,410 --> 01:44:21,050
I forgot on purpose.

2123
01:44:21,790 --> 01:44:22,850
Forget it!

2124
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:24,110
We've gotta hustle!

2125
01:44:26,550 --> 01:44:27,390
No!

2126
01:44:27,390 --> 01:44:30,310
There's something very important in my things.

2127
01:44:33,650 --> 01:44:34,950
What the fuck is that?

2128
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:46,640
Why, you... planning to steal the tank all for yourself from the start, were you...

2129
01:44:53,610 --> 01:44:56,250
Bro, the helmets are so fucking stupid.

2130
01:44:58,050 --> 01:45:01,410
Why can't they just wear those, like, the red berets?

2131
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:02,030
Like...

2132
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:04,170
That's right.

2133
01:45:04,250 --> 01:45:06,070
You got shot for trying to run away.

2134
01:45:06,370 --> 01:45:06,450
Why'd you shoot me?

2135
01:45:06,730 --> 01:45:09,050
A bullet wouldn't have even scratched me!

2136
01:45:09,210 --> 01:45:09,410
Yeah!

2137
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:10,470
I'm a demon!

2138
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:11,730
No choice now.

2139
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:12,850
We'll have to break through.

2140
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:13,950
Time to go loud!

2141
01:45:14,370 --> 01:45:17,670
Every time I see their fucking helmet, I'm just like, that's so stupid.

2142
01:45:18,650 --> 01:45:19,810
Can I shoot it?

2143
01:45:20,010 --> 01:45:20,990
Guys, don't worry!

2144
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:22,250
It's not murder!

2145
01:45:24,430 --> 01:45:26,450
Guys, see?

2146
01:45:26,550 --> 01:45:27,230
He's okay!

2147
01:45:27,570 --> 01:45:28,850
I told you!

2148
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:29,790
See?

2149
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,170
He survived!

2150
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:33,090
I shouldn't waste that.

2151
01:45:46,590 --> 01:45:48,370
Okay, I'm gonna use bullets now.

2152
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:49,870
See?

2153
01:45:49,870 --> 01:45:50,190
Look!

2154
01:45:50,190 --> 01:45:50,430
See?

2155
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:52,930
I didn't... Look, they're okay!

2156
01:45:53,150 --> 01:45:55,510
They just fell down because they tripped.

2157
01:45:56,310 --> 01:45:56,870
Guys...

2158
01:45:59,750 --> 01:46:00,310
Wait.

2159
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:01,150
What do I have to do?

2160
01:46:01,170 --> 01:46:01,330
I have to go.

2161
01:46:02,690 --> 01:46:03,910
Do I slam it?

2162
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:06,590
Guys, it's the XP, guys.

2163
01:46:07,150 --> 01:46:08,010
It's the XP.

2164
01:46:08,130 --> 01:46:08,830
Can I run him over?

2165
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:10,810
Oh my god!

2166
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:11,130
I can!

2167
01:46:12,510 --> 01:46:13,550
Oh, I should...

2168
01:46:14,210 --> 01:46:14,650
Boom!

2169
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:15,650
Okay.

2170
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:18,050
Sorry, I was too busy running people over.

2171
01:46:19,930 --> 01:46:21,570
Can I run over these cars, too?

2172
01:46:21,810 --> 01:46:22,430
Oh my god!

2173
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:23,910
I can run over the cars, too!

2174
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:25,330
Okay.

2175
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:26,130
Let's go back.

2176
01:46:28,190 --> 01:46:29,050
Alright, don't worry.

2177
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:29,410
Watch.

2178
01:46:29,410 --> 01:46:30,250
See?

2179
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:30,550
Look!

2180
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:31,170
Oh my god!

2181
01:46:31,210 --> 01:46:33,270
It's like a fucking motor car.

2182
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:35,870
Like, it's a motorcycle.

2183
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:36,870
It's a motor car.

2184
01:46:37,250 --> 01:46:38,430
Wait, that's a real car.

2185
01:46:40,530 --> 01:46:41,490
A unicar?

2186
01:46:41,590 --> 01:46:42,410
No, that's a...

2187
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:44,590
A dual car.

2188
01:46:45,230 --> 01:46:46,370
It's like a... Oh!

2189
01:46:46,590 --> 01:46:48,110
Wait, a dual cycle.

2190
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:51,670
It's not lethal, guys.

2191
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:54,690
Motorcycle.

2192
01:46:54,890 --> 01:46:56,050
They're so brave.

2193
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:59,190
Do not engage in infantry.

2194
01:46:59,730 --> 01:47:01,350
I can't help it!

2195
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:03,730
I see people I shoot.

2196
01:47:07,690 --> 01:47:08,890
I can't!

2197
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:09,770
No survivors!

2198
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,520
No survivors!

2199
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:17,380
Oh shit.

2200
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,740
Guys, look at that.

2201
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:23,080
I can drive without having to look in the front.

2202
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:25,080
Oh guys.

2203
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:25,740
Oh no.

2204
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:27,760
Boom.

2205
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:28,880
See the car?

2206
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:29,780
Did it explode?

2207
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,740
Guys, don't worry.

2208
01:47:31,820 --> 01:47:32,280
They survived.

2209
01:47:37,180 --> 01:47:37,760
Don't worry.

2210
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,180
They survived.

2211
01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:40,080
A car cycle!

2212
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:42,680
They're so alive.

2213
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,840
Because murder is my line.

2214
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:47,980
Daisy, thank you for the super chat.

2215
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:48,700
Thank you, thank you.

2216
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:52,580
Tezuka-san did very, you know, before, during, and after.

2217
01:47:52,620 --> 01:47:55,540
Man knew what he liked and he did it well.

2218
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:13,260
I'm pretty sure, um, if like, if they put those artwork up for auction, the amount of money they can get from that is like actually crazy.

2219
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:21,000
Because like, people who buy those are, they're fucking, there are a lot of suspiciously very wealthy furries out there.

2220
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:27,400
And I would not be surprised if like, if they go up an auction that that, those type of artwork from Tezuka-san, they're gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna buy this.

2221
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:31,060
Tezuka-san would be sold for like, like 500 grand.

2222
01:48:38,240 --> 01:48:40,620
It would be millions, yeah.

2223
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:56,640
I'm convinced he was the first modern furry artist.

2224
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,100
Without a single fatality!

2225
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:01,880
Let's go!

2226
01:49:05,200 --> 01:49:06,020
What is that?

2227
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,280
Prince, you should try heading over there.

2228
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,540
Oh, I can like attach a tank gun!

2229
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,460
Is this the tank part?

2230
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:18,740
Looks like a main cannon.

2231
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:22,500
If we install it in the tank, it'll make it way stronger.

2232
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:25,880
Oh my god, I'm gonna absorb all the other tank parts.

2233
01:49:27,340 --> 01:49:30,960
If I remember right, the old road ahead leads to a campsite.

2234
01:49:31,900 --> 01:49:33,180
We can install it there.

2235
01:49:34,260 --> 01:49:34,680
Which way?

2236
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,700
No, not...

2237
01:49:44,740 --> 01:49:46,020
A simulation.

2238
01:49:46,060 --> 01:49:48,060
I'm gonna simulate all the other tanks.

2239
01:49:52,270 --> 01:49:53,710
We should be safe from the royal...

2240
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:55,290
Majin Buu tank!

2241
01:49:58,790 --> 01:50:00,770
Let's install the cannon you scored.

2242
01:50:03,250 --> 01:50:04,110
Great idea!

2243
01:50:05,270 --> 01:50:06,410
Let's do it!

2244
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:12,330
Okay, customize vehicles.

2245
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:13,870
I can customize them now!

2246
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:15,630
I'm gonna use the...

2247
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:16,930
What's this?

2248
01:50:17,050 --> 01:50:18,330
Oh wait, that's stronger.

2249
01:50:18,690 --> 01:50:19,330
See that?

2250
01:50:19,610 --> 01:50:20,850
This is me!

2251
01:50:21,050 --> 01:50:24,730
If I see stats numbers up, numbers go up, means stronger.

2252
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:26,170
And tutorial.

2253
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:26,990
That's it?

2254
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:27,730
That was the tutorial?

2255
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:28,550
I did it.

2256
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:29,950
What?

2257
01:50:33,450 --> 01:50:35,130
Hey, Born Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

2258
01:50:35,250 --> 01:50:35,930
Thank you, thank you!

2259
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:39,890
The guy manning the flaming wreck that was a tank are just... Yeah, they're just unconscious, guys.

2260
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:44,190
Number go up equals good.

2261
01:50:45,470 --> 01:50:46,730
Power is welcome indeed.

2262
01:50:48,590 --> 01:50:52,770
Thing is though, the transmission's at its limit after that battle.

2263
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:57,570
Suspension's... I learned a lot from that tutorial, guys.

2264
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:00,090
We'll be walking soon if nothing's done about it.

2265
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:02,570
Wait, did she get shot?

2266
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:03,290
Is she okay?

2267
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,850
Yeah.

2268
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:08,530
Tried my hand at any number of things during the war.

2269
01:51:09,250 --> 01:51:14,270
I bet you it's gonna reveal that he used to be in the army and he's like a deserter.

2270
01:51:14,270 --> 01:51:14,370
Okay.

2271
01:51:14,370 --> 01:51:15,210
Tanks I liked.

2272
01:51:15,390 --> 01:51:17,010
Endless fighting I didn't.

2273
01:51:19,390 --> 01:51:22,150
Well, I'm glad to have another gearhead around.

2274
01:51:24,630 --> 01:51:25,330
Hold up.

2275
01:51:25,410 --> 01:51:27,310
You mean our tank's already fallen apart?

2276
01:51:27,550 --> 01:51:28,810
We just got it!

2277
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:33,330
I can patch it up, but that's a temporary fix.

2278
01:51:34,650 --> 01:51:37,750
Well can't you do something, ace mechanic?

2279
01:51:39,290 --> 01:51:40,910
If we had the parts, yeah.

2280
01:51:41,290 --> 01:51:42,290
And the tools.

2281
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:45,350
Of course.

2282
01:51:45,510 --> 01:51:48,550
You know, I've got a little business in Spino.

2283
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:50,610
I knew it.

2284
01:51:50,610 --> 01:51:51,290
I knew it!

2285
01:51:53,930 --> 01:51:55,510
There's a garage there where I should be able to get this fixed up for you.

2286
01:51:55,510 --> 01:51:58,950
She gave me a sneak peek and then later on she charges me.

2287
01:51:59,050 --> 01:52:00,250
I fucking knew it.

2288
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:02,070
I'm just a cash cow to her.

2289
01:52:03,310 --> 01:52:03,810
Spino?

2290
01:52:03,810 --> 01:52:06,190
She's gonna charge me for all these tank parts.

2291
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:09,790
It's in the mountains to the south.

2292
01:52:09,850 --> 01:52:10,890
That's how they hook you in.

2293
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:11,810
I think.

2294
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:14,250
But don't quote me on that.

2295
01:52:15,030 --> 01:52:16,270
That's how they get you.

2296
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:19,050
You're all the same.

2297
01:52:25,050 --> 01:52:26,070
Yeah, how do you know?

2298
01:52:28,930 --> 01:52:31,430
Didn't you say you have a business in Spino?

2299
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:39,710
My free trial of tank has expired.

2300
01:52:40,290 --> 01:52:41,670
It's a subscription based.

2301
01:52:45,470 --> 01:52:47,770
I don't know what's become of it.

2302
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:49,390
Only heard rumors.

2303
01:52:51,210 --> 01:52:53,190
Well, what have we got to lose?

2304
01:52:54,290 --> 01:52:57,810
Without the tank, we'll never make it to the legendary spring.

2305
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,030
We should just go back.

2306
01:53:01,090 --> 01:53:02,570
No, we should just rob Spino.

2307
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:04,990
Really didn't sound like a good time.

2308
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:10,330
If that's settled, we'll get started on some makeshift repairs.

2309
01:53:11,610 --> 01:53:13,570
You guys should get some rest.

2310
01:53:15,250 --> 01:53:15,790
Thanks.

2311
01:53:16,090 --> 01:53:17,510
We'll take you up on that.

2312
01:53:20,230 --> 01:53:20,770
Yay!

2313
01:53:21,530 --> 01:53:22,530
Mission complete!

2314
01:53:22,770 --> 01:53:24,350
We got our tank, boys!

2315
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:29,010
I wanna punch it.

2316
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:36,010
Alright.

2317
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:37,730
Wait, we don't have beds?

2318
01:53:38,070 --> 01:53:39,270
Do we just sleep on the rock?

2319
01:53:42,130 --> 01:53:43,150
Oh, yes.

2320
01:53:43,330 --> 01:53:45,790
Let me loot our... Let me loot my own loot.

2321
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:48,070
Press ring to choose an item.

2322
01:53:48,270 --> 01:53:51,410
Replay press A to use multiple at once.

2323
01:53:51,670 --> 01:53:53,030
Select item to use.

2324
01:53:53,070 --> 01:53:54,150
Hold X to reset.

2325
01:53:54,550 --> 01:53:55,010
Okay.

2326
01:53:55,950 --> 01:53:57,430
Wait, what do I have to press again?

2327
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:01,350
Um...

2328
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:03,710
Um...

2329
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:10,350
Guys, I forgot... How do I select my ring again?

2330
01:54:10,530 --> 01:54:11,090
Oh, there it is.

2331
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:12,170
Okay, I did it.

2332
01:54:13,050 --> 01:54:15,290
Repair kit restores a little bit.

2333
01:54:16,850 --> 01:54:18,790
Select item... How do I...

2334
01:54:19,530 --> 01:54:21,650
I guess you can't customize this yet.

2335
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:23,090
Guys, no.

2336
01:54:23,130 --> 01:54:23,610
I understood.

2337
01:54:23,810 --> 01:54:24,650
I understood, guys.

2338
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:26,290
I figured it out.

2339
01:54:27,850 --> 01:54:30,010
Tutorial needs a tutorial.

2340
01:54:31,130 --> 01:54:31,650
Alright.

2341
01:54:32,210 --> 01:54:34,710
Injust a battle tank control type from the options.

2342
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:39,210
Other control types and settings can be adjusted to create an experience that suits your playstyle.

2343
01:54:39,490 --> 01:54:39,790
Alright.

2344
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:41,710
I wanna see if I can upgrade.

2345
01:54:41,890 --> 01:54:42,290
Oh, I can!

2346
01:54:42,690 --> 01:54:43,030
Okay.

2347
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:45,190
So, flying...

2348
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:47,470
Allows you to quickly regain your stance.

2349
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:48,810
Allows you to evade.

2350
01:54:48,890 --> 01:54:51,910
Okay, I think I'd rather have the evasion mid jump.

2351
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:55,450
Uh... What about my allies?

2352
01:54:56,730 --> 01:54:58,090
Can I upgrade them yet?

2353
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:03,250
Uh... Increase the amount of money earned from defeating enemy.

2354
01:55:03,530 --> 01:55:05,550
The enemy is gifted a bomb.

2355
01:55:06,910 --> 01:55:07,470
Okay.

2356
01:55:07,810 --> 01:55:09,630
We're gonna see... We're gonna get...

2357
01:55:09,630 --> 01:55:10,930
Rai or something.

2358
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:13,330
Rai... Rau... Rau...

2359
01:55:16,230 --> 01:55:17,270
Deploy hairspray.

2360
01:55:17,370 --> 01:55:18,930
How much hairspray do you have?

2361
01:55:19,170 --> 01:55:20,010
Look at your hair!

2362
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:23,690
I wanna assume the thief has hairspray.

2363
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,790
Oops.

2364
01:55:35,030 --> 01:55:37,990
Okay, where do we go?

2365
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:41,390
Is that it?

2366
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:42,690
Okay.

2367
01:55:43,330 --> 01:55:44,150
Oh, there's a dead end.

2368
01:55:44,510 --> 01:55:45,550
What luck.

2369
01:55:46,190 --> 01:55:47,890
Don't shave his hair.

2370
01:55:48,430 --> 01:55:49,810
Oh my god, they have tanks!

2371
01:55:50,370 --> 01:55:50,930
Assimilate.

2372
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:54,150
Be one with the tank.

2373
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:54,770
Right?

2374
01:55:55,570 --> 01:55:58,030
Just destroy the real and it'll come down.

2375
01:56:00,170 --> 01:56:01,390
My kind of plan.

2376
01:56:01,610 --> 01:56:02,710
Let's get to it.

2377
01:56:05,110 --> 01:56:06,330
Alright, here we go.

2378
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:08,150
We go in.

2379
01:56:08,970 --> 01:56:10,870
I'm gonna assimilate this tank.

2380
01:56:11,050 --> 01:56:11,850
Make us whole.

2381
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:17,990
It's mine now.

2382
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:21,950
Give me your tank.

2383
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:24,090
Give me your tank.

2384
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:26,150
No!

2385
01:56:26,310 --> 01:56:28,010
Let me assimilate you!

2386
01:56:30,550 --> 01:56:32,830
Oh my god, I can like scope in.

2387
01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:33,790
What the fuck?

2388
01:56:35,110 --> 01:56:35,630
Okay.

2389
01:56:36,770 --> 01:56:38,250
Don't worry, they're okay, guys.

2390
01:56:40,690 --> 01:56:41,790
They're fine, guys.

2391
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:42,450
See, look.

2392
01:56:42,530 --> 01:56:43,150
They're okay.

2393
01:56:44,930 --> 01:56:45,410
Okay.

2394
01:56:45,410 --> 01:56:46,850
You would have to lower the bridge.

2395
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:48,990
How do I lower it?

2396
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:51,170
Oh, here it is.

2397
01:56:52,930 --> 01:56:53,850
Is that the real?

2398
01:56:54,570 --> 01:56:55,530
It is!

2399
01:56:57,090 --> 01:56:58,530
Is there loot around me?

2400
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:02,050
Wait, there's tents here.

2401
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:02,730
There's holes.

2402
01:57:02,830 --> 01:57:03,610
There must be loot.

2403
01:57:04,150 --> 01:57:06,430
If you see a hole, there's a loot in there.

2404
01:57:07,730 --> 01:57:08,630
I knew it.

2405
01:57:09,650 --> 01:57:10,390
It's okay.

2406
01:57:10,670 --> 01:57:11,630
Keep up.

2407
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:13,070
It's okay.

2408
01:57:13,390 --> 01:57:15,150
The army don't need this loot.

2409
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:15,750
They're evil.

2410
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:18,550
Evil people don't need loot, guys.

2411
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:19,630
Okay.

2412
01:57:20,190 --> 01:57:25,030
It's not like these military men might be innocent and just trying to find a place, you know.

2413
01:57:25,050 --> 01:57:32,770
It's not because they joined the army because it was a nice place to live and be fed and have water rather than die in their village.

2414
01:57:32,950 --> 01:57:33,330
No, no, no.

2415
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:34,410
They're all evil, guys.

2416
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:37,330
Every single one of them.

2417
01:57:40,130 --> 01:57:41,230
Oh, here's one here.

2418
01:57:41,390 --> 01:57:42,530
Oh, so much loot.

2419
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:43,750
So much loot.

2420
01:57:44,350 --> 01:57:46,630
It might turn out to be useful later.

2421
01:57:46,990 --> 01:57:47,930
Anything else here?

2422
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:50,610
Loot hole.

2423
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,950
Somebody said I missed a chest here.

2424
01:57:53,050 --> 01:57:53,530
No, I didn't.

2425
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:54,710
Oh, it's right here.

2426
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:57,250
Nice.

2427
01:57:58,750 --> 01:57:59,890
Wait, where's my tank?

2428
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:00,970
Oh, there it is.

2429
01:58:01,070 --> 01:58:01,930
Right in front of me.

2430
01:58:05,820 --> 01:58:06,880
They're all evil!

2431
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:08,680
They come to me!

2432
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:10,720
I just starved instead of joining the army.

2433
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:17,600
Yeah.

2434
01:58:21,340 --> 01:58:22,460
But they don't count.

2435
01:58:22,640 --> 01:58:23,180
They're not real.

2436
01:58:25,980 --> 01:58:26,800
Oh, shit.

2437
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:29,720
I should have saved my fucking thing for...

2438
01:58:30,340 --> 01:58:31,760
Okay, I should have saved...

2439
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:35,040
I should have saved the armor piercing for the actual tanks themselves.

2440
01:58:36,180 --> 01:58:36,800
It's okay.

2441
01:58:36,900 --> 01:58:37,500
I'll be fine.

2442
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:38,620
The tank will be fine.

2443
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:40,900
At least that was sort of fun.

2444
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:43,860
Every hole is a gloot.

2445
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:45,320
Exactly, Alan.

2446
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:47,040
Assimilate.

2447
01:58:47,180 --> 01:58:47,800
Assimilate.

2448
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:48,420
Assimilate.

2449
01:58:48,420 --> 01:58:49,320
I'm not that mobile.

2450
01:58:50,660 --> 01:58:52,700
They're not the main character.

2451
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:54,480
So they're evil.

2452
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:56,280
I guess.

2453
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,300
Steal all their resources.

2454
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:01,700
They don't matter!

2455
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:03,440
Yay!

2456
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:04,960
Keep it.

2457
01:59:05,080 --> 01:59:07,140
It might turn out to be useful later.

2458
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:07,660
Yeah.

2459
01:59:11,420 --> 01:59:15,040
I, as a demon, is going to cleanse all the evil in this world.

2460
01:59:15,140 --> 01:59:16,940
So only I can be the...

2461
01:59:17,500 --> 01:59:18,900
So I can have the monopoly.

2462
01:59:24,140 --> 01:59:27,000
If anybody's going to be evil around here...

2463
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,760
It's going to be me.

2464
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:33,260
The one true evil.

2465
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:34,940
The one true evil.

2466
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:37,160
The one true evil.

2467
01:59:38,360 --> 01:59:38,840
Who?

2468
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:44,880
D'oh!

2469
01:59:50,030 --> 01:59:53,850
I need you to help save Satsяться.

2470
01:59:53,850 --> 01:59:53,890
Am I strong enough to defeat you?

2471
01:59:54,590 --> 01:59:55,350
All you need to be quite ready if there's something you're going to attack you.

2472
01:59:55,350 --> 01:59:55,850
Is there a Pc stock?

2473
01:59:57,230 --> 01:59:57,590
I'll keep you too.

2474
01:59:57,590 --> 02:00:00,390
Take care, Oddını.

2475
02:00:09,310 --> 02:00:09,370
Here we go!

2476
02:00:09,370 --> 02:00:11,830
Your vehicle will move forward and so this mode will be disabled.

2477
02:00:12,030 --> 02:00:12,270
Okay.

2478
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:15,310
Actually destroy it?

2479
02:00:15,390 --> 02:00:16,290
You liars.

2480
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:17,530
You liar.

2481
02:00:18,230 --> 02:00:19,330
I can't believe it.

2482
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:20,350
This door is...

2483
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:23,070
What kind of material is this door made out of?

2484
02:00:23,130 --> 02:00:24,050
Holy fuck.

2485
02:00:26,850 --> 02:00:27,130
Alright.

2486
02:00:34,070 --> 02:00:36,210
There can only be one.

2487
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:37,330
Oh my god!

2488
02:00:37,370 --> 02:00:38,110
I shoot the bird!

2489
02:00:39,370 --> 02:00:41,670
What would you do if you ran into a tough enemy?

2490
02:00:42,430 --> 02:00:43,250
Shoot the bird!

2491
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:44,890
Oh my god!

2492
02:00:45,170 --> 02:00:47,410
I just shoot the bird!

2493
02:00:50,130 --> 02:00:50,910
Don't worry.

2494
02:00:52,790 --> 02:00:55,210
Look, he's okay.

2495
02:00:55,690 --> 02:00:56,550
Look, see?

2496
02:00:56,770 --> 02:00:57,770
He's okay.

2497
02:00:58,650 --> 02:00:59,250
Woah!

2498
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:00,830
There's a scorpion!

2499
02:01:04,430 --> 02:01:06,150
What would you do if you ran into a tough enemy?

2500
02:01:06,150 --> 02:01:07,030
Friendly fight.

2501
02:01:07,710 --> 02:01:09,230
It just works.

2502
02:01:09,230 --> 02:01:09,770
It just works.

2503
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:11,590
What gives?

2504
02:01:12,650 --> 02:01:14,230
I can shoot the bird!

2505
02:01:14,710 --> 02:01:15,370
10 out of 10.

2506
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:19,270
Could you be any ruder?

2507
02:01:19,750 --> 02:01:20,870
Wait, am I driving backwards?

2508
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:22,450
I just said it like it is.

2509
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:23,850
It's okay.

2510
02:01:24,570 --> 02:01:25,810
This is how you drive now.

2511
02:01:26,190 --> 02:01:28,650
Do I really smell weird?

2512
02:01:29,070 --> 02:01:30,890
When was the last time you showered?

2513
02:01:31,150 --> 02:01:32,190
I honestly can't say.

2514
02:01:32,330 --> 02:01:33,050
Oh my god!

2515
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:33,730
Look at them!

2516
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:34,550
It's so cute!

2517
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:35,350
Guys!

2518
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:37,830
Guys, look how cute this is!

2519
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:38,810
They're having a moment!

2520
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:46,030
I'm not a bad person.

2521
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:47,290
Right?

2522
02:01:54,370 --> 02:01:55,430
Oh my god, loot!

2523
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:59,310
They're like, my giant!

2524
02:02:02,370 --> 02:02:03,130
Don't worry.

2525
02:02:04,050 --> 02:02:05,330
You can leave.

2526
02:02:05,330 --> 02:02:08,170
Don't worry, you'll see your child in heaven.

2527
02:02:09,510 --> 02:02:11,050
Oh my god, there's mines!

2528
02:02:11,330 --> 02:02:12,350
There's ores here!

2529
02:02:12,870 --> 02:02:13,690
Where are mine?

2530
02:02:14,690 --> 02:02:15,750
Loot, loot, loot, loot.

2531
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:17,270
Loot.

2532
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:18,870
Loot.

2533
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:21,050
And then...

2534
02:02:21,050 --> 02:02:23,190
I punched the ores.

2535
02:02:25,590 --> 02:02:27,350
I'm just helping them reunite!

2536
02:02:27,410 --> 02:02:27,850
Exactly!

2537
02:02:29,070 --> 02:02:33,810
You want that mom to live her rest of her life in grief and depression?

2538
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:35,310
You want that mom to live her rest of her life in grief and depression?

2539
02:02:35,310 --> 02:02:38,010
I'm doing a good thing even though I might have caused her depression?

2540
02:02:39,930 --> 02:02:41,870
I was putting her out of her misery!

2541
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:43,470
Oh my god, I hit it.

2542
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:44,770
I hit those.

2543
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:46,750
Nice.

2544
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:50,910
Look, loot is important, chat.

2545
02:02:52,130 --> 02:02:53,690
It might be useful later!

2546
02:02:54,350 --> 02:02:54,550
It might be useful later!

2547
02:02:55,890 --> 02:02:59,090
Okay, I'm gonna use up all the ammo so I can reload.

2548
02:02:59,450 --> 02:02:59,470
Okay, I'm gonna use up all the ammo so I can reload.

2549
02:02:59,470 --> 02:03:00,610
I think that's the worst part.

2550
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:01,330
The reload.

2551
02:03:01,330 --> 02:03:03,030
Like manually...

2552
02:03:03,030 --> 02:03:05,490
You have to use all the ammo to reload.

2553
02:03:06,930 --> 02:03:09,170
I can't believe it's only 2 XP.

2554
02:03:09,490 --> 02:03:11,690
I think they try to prevent you from killing the wildlife.

2555
02:03:11,970 --> 02:03:13,410
Because they don't give you any XP.

2556
02:03:15,490 --> 02:03:18,030
Chat, don't justify your sins!

2557
02:03:23,850 --> 02:03:25,210
Oh, I can?

2558
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:26,290
How do I reload?

2559
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:33,180
What's that?

2560
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:33,860
King army?

2561
02:03:35,220 --> 02:03:35,900
Who's that?

2562
02:03:40,460 --> 02:03:41,540
Why planes?

2563
02:03:41,620 --> 02:03:42,380
Wait, what?

2564
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,620
Why did they outlaw planes?

2565
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,880
Where did he grab the helmet?

2566
02:03:59,880 --> 02:04:00,000
Oh, I can't see the helmet.

2567
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:08,940
Tank 104, report.

2568
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:10,700
Oh my god, look at his hair.

2569
02:04:11,280 --> 02:04:13,460
That's the guy that definitely used hairspray.

2570
02:04:14,260 --> 02:04:15,320
Do you read me?

2571
02:04:15,420 --> 02:04:17,260
Is your transmitter broken 104?

2572
02:04:18,360 --> 02:04:20,560
I like how it's like, Is your transmitter broken?

2573
02:04:20,640 --> 02:04:22,660
And then like, how would I...

2574
02:04:22,660 --> 02:04:23,600
Okay, like...

2575
02:04:24,440 --> 02:04:27,480
If it's broken, I won't be able to hear that.

2576
02:04:27,860 --> 02:04:29,860
If it's broken, I won't be able to hear that.

2577
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:36,760
What the f...

2578
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:38,360
You had it.

2579
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:39,340
Must be radio trouble.

2580
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:41,480
Fine.

2581
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:42,500
Let's move on.

2582
02:04:47,640 --> 02:04:53,120
I love that little like, eyelash detail that like he always does for his characters.

2583
02:04:53,300 --> 02:05:00,960
When they're like, when they're like, evil, but they're like, flamboyant evil, the little eyeliner and then the eyelash at the bottom.

2584
02:05:01,020 --> 02:05:03,340
I love that character trait that he does.

2585
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:04,680
We need to hide!

2586
02:05:05,880 --> 02:05:06,860
Take cover!

2587
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:07,840
Under that boulder!

2588
02:05:09,020 --> 02:05:09,560
Alright!

2589
02:05:15,340 --> 02:05:16,380
It just works, guys.

2590
02:05:17,720 --> 02:05:19,800
Is this really going to work?

2591
02:05:20,180 --> 02:05:21,800
Let's just see how things play out.

2592
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:28,540
Napspace reports someone has stolen a tank.

2593
02:05:28,640 --> 02:05:29,400
Number 104.

2594
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:32,320
The perpetrator has not been spotted.

2595
02:05:32,440 --> 02:05:34,720
But is capable of handling a tank.

2596
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,460
I repeat, Napspace!

2597
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:38,600
Turn us around quickly!

2598
02:05:39,680 --> 02:05:41,180
Why is that crooked to hamburger?

2599
02:05:42,420 --> 02:05:45,080
Thinks he can fool General Ari, does he?

2600
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:45,540
Thinks he can fool General Ari, does he?

2601
02:05:45,540 --> 02:05:47,320
We gotta change the numbers on our tank!

2602
02:05:47,480 --> 02:05:47,940
Guys!

2603
02:05:50,840 --> 02:05:52,380
How did they know?

2604
02:05:53,300 --> 02:05:54,160
How did they know?

2605
02:05:54,160 --> 02:05:54,920
Too loud!

2606
02:05:56,240 --> 02:05:57,820
Biel, uncover the tank!

2607
02:05:58,000 --> 02:05:59,440
We have to find!

2608
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:02,280
I told you to call in Prince Bielsebub!

2609
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,280
I'll take him out myself!

2610
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:05,920
I'll take him out myself!

2611
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:07,300
It's okay, I'm going to shoot the plane.

2612
02:06:09,140 --> 02:06:10,500
I have so much ammo!

2613
02:06:11,020 --> 02:06:11,040
I have so much ammo!

2614
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:12,080
What does it do?

2615
02:06:12,180 --> 02:06:12,740
Shoot back?

2616
02:06:14,520 --> 02:06:15,560
Watch this.

2617
02:06:15,660 --> 02:06:15,800
Over there!

2618
02:06:16,060 --> 02:06:17,340
Head for the high ground!

2619
02:06:17,480 --> 02:06:18,600
Wait, the high ground?

2620
02:06:19,820 --> 02:06:20,300
No!

2621
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:21,800
What do you mean?

2622
02:06:21,860 --> 02:06:24,280
I can't fucking pull up!

2623
02:06:24,340 --> 02:06:25,520
Oh my god, he's right.

2624
02:06:26,060 --> 02:06:26,800
He's right.

2625
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:30,260
They won't be able to hurt us without their machine gun.

2626
02:06:30,740 --> 02:06:31,960
Take that down first.

2627
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:33,320
Which one?

2628
02:06:33,420 --> 02:06:33,660
There?

2629
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:35,680
I got it.

2630
02:06:36,080 --> 02:06:37,400
We're going to counter attack.

2631
02:06:38,100 --> 02:06:39,420
Hide behind those rocks.

2632
02:06:40,420 --> 02:06:42,220
You can boost to avoid attacks.

2633
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:45,020
Just make sure to watch out for overheating.

2634
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:45,800
Okay, I got you.

2635
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:47,180
I got you, sir!

2636
02:06:47,480 --> 02:06:50,480
Try slipping behind a rock to get the leeway to reload safely.

2637
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:52,300
Don't worry, sir.

2638
02:06:52,420 --> 02:06:53,020
I got you!

2639
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:54,480
I'm hiding!

2640
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:55,620
Oh!

2641
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:58,200
It looks like we've managed to give them the...

2642
02:06:58,200 --> 02:06:59,380
How do you reload?

2643
02:06:59,460 --> 02:07:01,120
There's no reload button!

2644
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:04,440
There's literally no reload!

2645
02:07:05,080 --> 02:07:10,060
We tell them from behind, I felt like I was lying to you about reload!

2646
02:07:10,540 --> 02:07:11,200
...from high ground.

2647
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:15,820
If hitting the machine gun's too chancy, keep aiming for the tank.

2648
02:07:16,380 --> 02:07:16,920
Okay.

2649
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:19,500
I know you can do this!

2650
02:07:19,740 --> 02:07:21,100
B is not reload!

2651
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:25,320
It's the swap car- It's okay, I'm in their blind spot.

2652
02:07:27,080 --> 02:07:27,940
Look at the top!

2653
02:07:28,080 --> 02:07:28,600
Oh my god!

2654
02:07:28,660 --> 02:07:29,520
There's a top right?!

2655
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:31,280
Oh my-

2656
02:07:35,600 --> 02:07:39,640
Guys, guys, did you guys know top right, there's instructions over there?

2657
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:43,980
Did you guys know that?

2658
02:07:44,080 --> 02:07:44,700
Did you see?

2659
02:07:45,260 --> 02:07:46,080
Did you see?

2660
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:47,860
Did you see it?

2661
02:07:51,320 --> 02:07:52,620
I'm learning guys!

2662
02:07:52,820 --> 02:07:53,560
I'm learning!

2663
02:07:54,820 --> 02:07:56,220
Oh god, oh god, look.

2664
02:07:56,340 --> 02:07:58,200
I can just hide behind here.

2665
02:07:58,500 --> 02:07:59,580
The blind spot.

2666
02:08:00,740 --> 02:08:02,340
He's so confused guys.

2667
02:08:02,460 --> 02:08:02,760
Look!

2668
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:04,000
Look at that fool!

2669
02:08:04,120 --> 02:08:05,140
He's so confused.

2670
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:08,540
Oh no, oh no, oh no!

2671
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:09,820
Oh no!

2672
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:13,240
He doesn't know where I am!

2673
02:08:15,480 --> 02:08:16,940
God, we gotta head to high ground.

2674
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:18,720
We have to head to high ground!

2675
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:19,300
We have to head to high ground!

2676
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:23,960
Okay!

2677
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:24,640
You know what?

2678
02:08:24,700 --> 02:08:27,580
I don't even need a- I don't need to destroy the machine gun.

2679
02:08:27,660 --> 02:08:28,880
I can literally just shoot it.

2680
02:08:31,380 --> 02:08:32,940
Thank you for the super chat!

2681
02:08:33,040 --> 02:08:33,260
Thank you!

2682
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:35,960
Dokia's best when she's illiterate.

2683
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:36,840
She's perfect.

2684
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,360
Illiterate and dumb.

2685
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:39,940
And dumb.

2686
02:08:41,540 --> 02:08:42,160
And dumb.

2687
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:45,640
And dumb.

2688
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:46,480
We're trying to bomb us!

2689
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:52,260
Anticipate the enemy's course and cut them off!

2690
02:08:52,540 --> 02:08:53,180
Bombs away!

2691
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:57,640
It's only a matter of time before nothing's left of us but a smoking crater!

2692
02:08:58,880 --> 02:08:59,360
See!

2693
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:01,940
That's a water tank?

2694
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:03,680
Nooooo!

2695
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:05,700
The free water!

2696
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:07,340
Lift the front end!

2697
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:09,240
And try to shoot straight up!

2698
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:14,390
It's no good!

2699
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:15,970
Even at max output!

2700
02:09:16,230 --> 02:09:16,990
We still win!

2701
02:09:17,010 --> 02:09:18,790
We weigh 1562 kilos!

2702
02:09:18,990 --> 02:09:19,950
How do you know that?

2703
02:09:20,430 --> 02:09:21,650
What does that say?

2704
02:09:24,650 --> 02:09:27,370
Never ask a tank how much it weighs, guys.

2705
02:09:27,830 --> 02:09:29,550
That's still as much as a normal car!

2706
02:09:30,250 --> 02:09:30,730
That's still as much as a normal car!

2707
02:09:31,650 --> 02:09:32,750
What do you think you're doing?

2708
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:34,290
Get back in the tank now!

2709
02:09:34,490 --> 02:09:36,130
What, you think my help's gonna make it heavier?

2710
02:09:40,890 --> 02:09:41,730
Oh shit!

2711
02:09:45,980 --> 02:09:46,520
That's right!

2712
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:46,620
Run!

2713
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:49,580
Keep pushing!

2714
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:54,460
We got this!

2715
02:09:55,440 --> 02:09:56,680
What if I just stop?

2716
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:57,540
What if I just stop?

2717
02:09:57,540 --> 02:09:58,520
Would I crush my allies?

2718
02:09:59,200 --> 02:09:59,640
Would I crush my allies?

2719
02:09:59,980 --> 02:10:02,160
What if I don't do it?

2720
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:03,840
Oh, nothing happens.

2721
02:10:04,140 --> 02:10:06,440
Okay, there's no consequences for my actions.

2722
02:10:07,380 --> 02:10:11,020
I just thought it'd be funny if there was a game over screen where the tank just crushes them.

2723
02:10:11,640 --> 02:10:12,080
I just thought it'd be funny if there was a game over screen where the tank just crushes them.

2724
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,280
I can't believe it!

2725
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,920
Never punished.

2726
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:36,030
Quick!

2727
02:10:40,930 --> 02:10:41,470
Assimilate!

2728
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:44,830
Become one with the tank.

2729
02:10:45,410 --> 02:10:47,110
With the mother tank.

2730
02:10:48,630 --> 02:10:51,070
Thief, we managed to pull through that somehow.

2731
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:53,650
We did!

2732
02:10:54,450 --> 02:10:54,990
Odd though.

2733
02:10:55,170 --> 02:10:58,530
That plane seemed to be transporting a massive amount of water.

2734
02:11:00,650 --> 02:11:05,270
If that's true, the king's water supply must be in the direction it came from.

2735
02:11:07,410 --> 02:11:10,310
Meaning that it must also lie to the south of here.

2736
02:11:10,810 --> 02:11:12,970
Yeah, like where did they grab all that water?

2737
02:11:13,870 --> 02:11:15,530
They know where the spring is!

2738
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:20,230
You telling me this legendary spring we've been looking for all this time...

2739
02:11:21,550 --> 02:11:23,590
is really the king's water supply?

2740
02:11:25,530 --> 02:11:30,430
If that's true, doesn't that mean this whole journey's been for nothing?

2741
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:33,610
That's not nothing.

2742
02:11:33,890 --> 02:11:35,950
We're just gonna raid the camp.

2743
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:38,030
Wait!

2744
02:11:38,150 --> 02:11:39,330
The general's in there!

2745
02:11:39,750 --> 02:11:42,050
At this point, we've got to see it through.

2746
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:45,190
Interrogate him!

2747
02:11:45,490 --> 02:11:46,230
He's not dead!

2748
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:47,990
Because nobody dies in this game.

2749
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:48,790
Guys, remember that.

2750
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:54,210
Just kill the king.

2751
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:55,530
Uh oh.

2752
02:11:55,630 --> 02:11:58,190
We better get to... that town fast!

2753
02:12:00,250 --> 02:12:01,570
It's called Spino.

2754
02:12:03,690 --> 02:12:04,570
Yeah, back!

2755
02:12:04,750 --> 02:12:05,910
Come on, let's go!

2756
02:12:09,310 --> 02:12:10,850
Something's on the ground near the tank.

2757
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:12,990
Near my tank?

2758
02:12:13,450 --> 02:12:13,890
Where?

2759
02:12:15,210 --> 02:12:16,250
Alright, come on guys!

2760
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:16,730
Let's go!

2761
02:12:17,610 --> 02:12:19,090
It's time to assimilate!

2762
02:12:20,230 --> 02:12:22,230
Absorb for the mother tank!

2763
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:24,010
Where is the people at?

2764
02:12:24,310 --> 02:12:25,530
Because they're not dead, right?

2765
02:12:27,090 --> 02:12:28,350
They're alive, right?

2766
02:12:28,630 --> 02:12:30,110
What happened to the people?

2767
02:12:31,790 --> 02:12:35,410
Guys, did you know RB was reloaded this entire time?

2768
02:12:36,430 --> 02:12:37,030
That's right.

2769
02:12:37,190 --> 02:12:40,630
For the good of the country, we want to put an end to the water shortage.

2770
02:12:41,330 --> 02:12:43,750
Oh, I can destroy the rocks now!

2771
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:45,330
I realize!

2772
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:48,950
We are!

2773
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:52,830
Once we find that spring, I'm gonna take a leak in it.

2774
02:12:52,970 --> 02:12:54,490
Oh my god.

2775
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:56,290
Oh, he is...

2776
02:12:56,290 --> 02:12:57,090
Don't ruin the drinking water!

2777
02:12:59,510 --> 02:13:02,050
Oh no, he is evil.

2778
02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:03,670
Look, it wouldn't matter!

2779
02:13:03,850 --> 02:13:06,250
There's animals already in the drinking water.

2780
02:13:06,590 --> 02:13:10,390
So like, technically the animals already peed in the springs.

2781
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:12,650
So adding my pee...

2782
02:13:12,650 --> 02:13:13,230
Oh no!

2783
02:13:15,050 --> 02:13:15,730
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

2784
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:16,630
I'm sorry!

2785
02:13:16,630 --> 02:13:18,130
All I'm saying is...

2786
02:13:18,130 --> 02:13:18,930
It wouldn't make...

2787
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:20,370
That much of a difference!

2788
02:13:20,610 --> 02:13:21,550
It is!

2789
02:13:25,250 --> 02:13:26,630
Okay, let's see.

2790
02:13:26,930 --> 02:13:28,050
Alright, we gotta...

2791
02:13:28,050 --> 02:13:29,790
Do our allies stuff.

2792
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:30,790
Okay, uh...

2793
02:13:30,790 --> 02:13:32,110
I want more money.

2794
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:34,970
Sounds about right.

2795
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:39,470
All I'm saying is that it wouldn't make that much of a difference!

2796
02:13:40,590 --> 02:13:42,450
Ooh, heavy machine gun.

2797
02:13:42,970 --> 02:13:43,730
Damage up.

2798
02:13:43,970 --> 02:13:45,470
Okay, but damage is higher.

2799
02:13:45,550 --> 02:13:46,490
So that means it's better.

2800
02:13:46,730 --> 02:13:47,530
Here we go!

2801
02:13:54,220 --> 02:13:54,900
Alright.

2802
02:13:55,460 --> 02:13:55,800
Look!

2803
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:56,820
I'm just saying!

2804
02:13:57,160 --> 02:13:58,080
We're trying...

2805
02:13:58,080 --> 02:13:59,920
The pH levels are too low!

2806
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:02,140
So I'm upping the pH levels!

2807
02:14:05,100 --> 02:14:06,220
Who's talking?

2808
02:14:08,800 --> 02:14:11,980
Wait, I can turn on the radio?

2809
02:14:25,820 --> 02:14:27,180
Who's Zeyu?

2810
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:30,280
Oh, Supreme Commander Zeyu.

2811
02:14:30,680 --> 02:14:31,720
Is that old...

2812
02:14:31,840 --> 02:14:33,260
Wow, Rao!

2813
02:14:33,600 --> 02:14:34,400
That's suspicious!

2814
02:14:34,620 --> 02:14:37,000
How do you know about the Supreme Commander?

2815
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:43,500
It seems all too clear by now.

2816
02:14:43,700 --> 02:14:43,900
What the fuck?

2817
02:14:45,680 --> 02:14:48,900
We can safely assume that those vermin are heading...

2818
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:50,160
Oh my god, it is Mad Max.

2819
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:52,440
...to the bottom source.

2820
02:14:52,900 --> 02:14:53,420
What?

2821
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:55,040
They are the better of us!

2822
02:14:55,540 --> 02:14:58,620
Order all the main tanks to stand guard around us!

2823
02:15:00,560 --> 02:15:01,580
What the fuck?

2824
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:01,820
What the fuck?

2825
02:15:01,820 --> 02:15:02,960
What the fuck?

2826
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:08,160
Do not let them near that water!

2827
02:15:09,060 --> 02:15:11,660
Oh my god, this is Mad Max!

2828
02:15:13,220 --> 02:15:17,120
Meanwhile, we'll use the media to root them out of their little hidey hole!

2829
02:15:19,240 --> 02:15:21,240
And exterminate them once and for all!

2830
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:26,220
It's like, what if Frieza's little, like, ball vehicle thing was just a person?

2831
02:15:26,600 --> 02:15:27,440
Sir, yes sir!

2832
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:29,400
Those renegades won't get past me!

2833
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:31,800
Honestly, I don't know.

2834
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:33,060
Who steals a tank?

2835
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:35,740
This ought to be a fine honor.

2836
02:15:35,740 --> 02:15:36,480
Like, anybody?

2837
02:15:37,780 --> 02:15:39,220
I'd steal a tank!

2838
02:15:39,340 --> 02:15:40,460
It's a fucking tank!

2839
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:43,040
Looks like my glory actually has a spine for once.

2840
02:15:44,160 --> 02:15:46,600
Monster Envy, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2841
02:15:46,620 --> 02:15:49,000
Toriyama loves old geezers as villains!

2842
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,440
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

2843
02:15:52,720 --> 02:15:54,960
So that really is where the King's water source is located!

2844
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:55,740
Who wouldn't?

2845
02:15:56,460 --> 02:15:58,260
You wouldn't download a tank, would ya?

2846
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:59,840
It sounds like there's some secret surrounding it.

2847
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:01,780
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

2848
02:16:01,780 --> 02:16:04,480
Who's gonna change Crappy's typing?

2849
02:16:05,460 --> 02:16:07,600
Only one way to find out!

2850
02:16:08,200 --> 02:16:09,260
Let's head south!

2851
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:10,420
Alright.

2852
02:16:10,860 --> 02:16:12,060
It's getting dangerous!

2853
02:16:13,420 --> 02:16:15,560
Ooh, I love danger.

2854
02:16:16,040 --> 02:16:16,240
You call this fun?

2855
02:16:17,020 --> 02:16:18,840
I don't know if I'm going the right way.

2856
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:21,400
Wait, can I- Whoa, free loot!

2857
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:23,700
Full speed ahead!

2858
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:26,140
I can't believe they would just leave the loot there!

2859
02:16:26,440 --> 02:16:28,760
Out in the open, just for me!

2860
02:16:30,140 --> 02:16:31,340
I'll keep it.

2861
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,460
It might turn out to be useful later.

2862
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:34,460
What's this?

2863
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:38,740
Oh, there's a- There's lore!

2864
02:16:38,980 --> 02:16:44,240
Oh my god, if somebody's like- If somebody's loot, they're gonna have to come back here, right?

2865
02:16:44,540 --> 02:16:45,580
It might turn out to be useful later.

2866
02:16:45,580 --> 02:16:46,960
Well, they don't need to come back here anymore.

2867
02:16:47,340 --> 02:16:49,420
Thanks for- Oh my god, Ben died!

2868
02:16:49,940 --> 02:16:50,560
Thank you!

2869
02:16:51,780 --> 02:16:54,240
Thanks for playing Zenland!

2870
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:55,820
Assimilate exactly!

2871
02:16:56,540 --> 02:16:59,440
All tanks gotta assimilate into the mother tank.

2872
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:01,140
Can I drive off this?

2873
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:03,380
Oh my god, there's no fall damage!

2874
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:04,280
There's fall damage.

2875
02:17:06,640 --> 02:17:10,820
Guys, I don't know if you know this, guys, but there's fall damage.

2876
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:15,820
Okay, am I going the right way?

2877
02:17:15,940 --> 02:17:16,760
I'm lost already.

2878
02:17:17,160 --> 02:17:18,940
Oh no, after driving- Oh, this way.

2879
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:21,980
After driving off the cliff, I don't know where I'm heading.

2880
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:25,800
Alright, this is the end.

2881
02:17:25,820 --> 02:17:26,880
This way.

2882
02:17:27,100 --> 02:17:31,400
Alright, I learned that there was indeed a fall damage.

2883
02:17:31,540 --> 02:17:35,340
And now, I do not have the repair thing anymore.

2884
02:17:36,140 --> 02:17:39,360
Are there Royal Army soldiers all over Zenland?

2885
02:17:39,740 --> 02:17:41,400
There's even a bunch near our village.

2886
02:17:41,580 --> 02:17:42,220
Look just ahead.

2887
02:17:42,820 --> 02:17:43,880
See the bridge there?

2888
02:17:44,620 --> 02:17:46,140
Spino is right beyond it.

2889
02:17:46,220 --> 02:17:46,720
Is that Spino?

2890
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:48,140
Spino, huh?

2891
02:17:51,560 --> 02:17:53,740
Oh, that was- Okay, I thought that was the village.

2892
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:55,720
Guys, I knew there was a barrier.

2893
02:17:55,820 --> 02:17:59,680
Guys, I shot because I knew there was a barrier.

2894
02:18:03,060 --> 02:18:05,460
Spino's just on the other side of these doors.

2895
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:08,980
Come on, let's go in already.

2896
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:12,200
I'm dying to see the sights of a whole new town.

2897
02:18:12,580 --> 02:18:13,920
Oh my god, new town!

2898
02:18:16,380 --> 02:18:18,080
I was testing the defenses.

2899
02:18:18,320 --> 02:18:18,920
Exactly.

2900
02:18:21,120 --> 02:18:23,340
Damn, they have good defenses, guys.

2901
02:18:23,500 --> 02:18:25,800
No wonder the rebel army is so good.

2902
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:26,100
Okay.

2903
02:18:27,220 --> 02:18:28,280
They're still alive.

2904
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:30,340
It's Doki proof.

2905
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,840
Why is there no one living in this town?

2906
02:18:53,160 --> 02:18:54,800
The defenses were so good!

2907
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,980
I literally shot a fucking missile!

2908
02:18:57,680 --> 02:18:59,420
So I was told.

2909
02:19:03,240 --> 02:19:06,420
My visitors are rare around these parts.

2910
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:08,560
Are you folks travelers?

2911
02:19:10,660 --> 02:19:11,260
Yes.

2912
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:13,320
Oh my god, is he also old?

2913
02:19:17,260 --> 02:19:18,860
I'm this town's mayor.

2914
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:21,220
Now, I know you just got here.

2915
02:19:22,300 --> 02:19:26,100
But I'm afraid that I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

2916
02:19:26,220 --> 02:19:26,620
What?

2917
02:19:26,700 --> 02:19:26,720
I'm the town's mayor.

2918
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:26,900
What?

2919
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:27,640
Why?

2920
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:31,420
May I at least ask why?

2921
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:31,920
Yeah!

2922
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,860
What did I do?

2923
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:36,560
I didn't shoot your gate.

2924
02:19:36,580 --> 02:19:37,020
I swear.

2925
02:19:37,820 --> 02:19:39,740
We can't welcome outsiders.

2926
02:19:42,380 --> 02:19:43,360
Hold on a minute.

2927
02:19:43,540 --> 02:19:44,320
Mayor Tor.

2928
02:19:44,440 --> 02:19:45,520
What did I do wrong?

2929
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:46,860
I swear.

2930
02:19:48,120 --> 02:19:49,080
Yeah, I swear.

2931
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:52,320
You shot the gate, Doki.

2932
02:19:54,320 --> 02:19:55,140
That's a lie.

2933
02:19:55,380 --> 02:19:56,400
Don't believe I ever heard that.

2934
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:57,420
No, it wasn't me.

2935
02:19:57,820 --> 02:19:59,760
There's no cameras to prove anything.

2936
02:20:00,660 --> 02:20:02,960
You know who I am, young lady?

2937
02:20:02,980 --> 02:20:04,020
I have alibi.

2938
02:20:05,520 --> 02:20:06,080
Yes.

2939
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:10,240
I've only heard about you from Longo, though.

2940
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:11,100
Longo?

2941
02:20:11,280 --> 02:20:12,220
Who's Longo?

2942
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:14,520
Longo?

2943
02:20:15,300 --> 02:20:18,520
I know only one person by that name.

2944
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,140
The same one, no doubt.

2945
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:24,640
He wanted me to give you this letter.

2946
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:25,780
Take a look.

2947
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:30,120
Let's see then.

2948
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:31,760
Hmm?

2949
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:36,060
Why, this is the symbol of the rebel army.

2950
02:20:39,520 --> 02:20:43,620
So, the old war horse is still kicking, is he?

2951
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:45,500
Who the fuck is Longo?

2952
02:20:45,520 --> 02:20:46,500
Do you trust me now?

2953
02:20:50,060 --> 02:20:57,320
Why does the merchant sound like the guy from Sk- Look, like, in the world of voice acting, there's like ten people.

2954
02:20:57,500 --> 02:20:58,360
I suppose so.

2955
02:21:00,120 --> 02:21:02,940
You're free to use it, as you see fit.

2956
02:21:05,240 --> 02:21:06,080
Thank you.

2957
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:13,960
You worked some magic back there.

2958
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:19,160
The man who raised me is an old friend of the mayor's.

2959
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:20,260
That's all.

2960
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,320
What was in the letter?

2961
02:21:25,320 --> 02:21:27,880
Just a request to allow me to use the garage.

2962
02:21:29,480 --> 02:21:31,840
And tinker around to my ticking heart.

2963
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:39,180
And why exactly did you need to risk life and limb to use this specific garage?

2964
02:21:40,940 --> 02:21:43,000
Well, I mean, just look at it.

2965
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,200
I mean, like, yeah, like, this garage.

2966
02:21:46,280 --> 02:21:48,360
It literally has arms coming from the ceiling.

2967
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:52,820
It's been put through its paces, but it's well maintained.

2968
02:21:55,240 --> 02:21:56,960
The control console's working.

2969
02:21:57,280 --> 02:21:58,800
The power arm moves.

2970
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:01,820
And all the other stuff is working.

2971
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:03,700
And a whole smorgasbord of spare parts and tools.

2972
02:22:04,200 --> 02:22:04,780
Smorgasbord.

2973
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:11,300
You won't see a full-service pit stop nearly as good as this anywhere outside the army.

2974
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:15,300
I suppose, but...

2975
02:22:15,300 --> 02:22:15,860
She's right!

2976
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:18,780
But what?

2977
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:22,920
Enough with the chit-chat.

2978
02:22:23,120 --> 02:22:24,740
Can you fix our tank or not?

2979
02:22:27,500 --> 02:22:28,080
No.

2980
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:29,360
What if she says no?

2981
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:33,460
Also, I pinned the message from Bandai.

2982
02:22:34,100 --> 02:22:35,500
I'm gonna have my egos...

2983
02:22:35,500 --> 02:22:39,860
Guys, you might see my ego, like, from the moon for, like, the next month, guys.

2984
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:55,680
We're gonna talk to children?

2985
02:22:57,160 --> 02:22:57,860
Hello, kid.

2986
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:03,280
Come on!

2987
02:23:03,340 --> 02:23:04,000
Let's go!

2988
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:06,440
Child...

2989
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:08,540
Do you have money?

2990
02:23:09,520 --> 02:23:09,660
No!

2991
02:23:10,120 --> 02:23:10,680
Uh...

2992
02:23:11,340 --> 02:23:11,900
Demon...

2993
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:13,640
Chill out.

2994
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,400
I'm not gonna eat you or anything.

2995
02:23:16,940 --> 02:23:17,700
You're not?

2996
02:23:19,260 --> 02:23:21,080
Glad you're one of the nice ones.

2997
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:22,400
One of the nice ones?

2998
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:24,320
What do the evil ones do?

2999
02:23:24,580 --> 02:23:26,660
Cause apparently, we're not allowed to kill.

3000
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:30,720
So, like, what's the worst I can do at this point?

3001
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,520
Like...

3002
02:23:32,480 --> 02:23:34,640
You're talking to the Fiend Prince!

3003
02:23:35,300 --> 02:23:35,940
Beelzebub!

3004
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:37,880
Oh, I see.

3005
02:23:38,360 --> 02:23:39,980
Glad you're a nice prince.

3006
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:41,640
Ugh...

3007
02:23:41,640 --> 02:23:42,880
Whatever.

3008
02:23:44,260 --> 02:23:45,540
How do you like Spino?

3009
02:23:45,720 --> 02:23:46,920
Great place, huh?

3010
02:23:48,260 --> 02:23:48,900
Yeah...

3011
02:23:48,900 --> 02:23:50,460
A great big dump.

3012
02:23:52,480 --> 02:23:53,360
I'll admit.

3013
02:23:53,740 --> 02:23:55,200
It's seen better days.

3014
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:56,700
Dump?!

3015
02:23:56,700 --> 02:24:00,280
Ages ago, the Royal Army attacked the town.

3016
02:24:00,660 --> 02:24:01,800
That's how it ended up.

3017
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:05,640
But my hard work's gonna put Spino on the map.

3018
02:24:05,860 --> 02:24:07,420
What the fuck are you gonna do?

3019
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:08,180
You're a kid!

3020
02:24:09,040 --> 02:24:10,400
Thank you for the super chat.

3021
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:10,740
Thank you.

3022
02:24:11,020 --> 02:24:15,420
With all the assimilation happening, I expect this to become the Cell Saga.

3023
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:17,920
Also, do you know about Toriyama's Q Vault?

3024
02:24:18,060 --> 02:24:19,340
He designed a real car.

3025
02:24:19,500 --> 02:24:21,280
Wait, he made a real car?!

3026
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,260
I didn't know that.

3027
02:24:25,480 --> 02:24:26,680
He has plans.

3028
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:29,560
You're a five years old child.

3029
02:24:29,960 --> 02:24:30,740
What are you gonna do?

3030
02:24:33,620 --> 02:24:34,180
I'm a child.

3031
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:35,640
What is this child gonna do?

3032
02:24:37,700 --> 02:24:38,260
I'm a child.

3033
02:24:38,260 --> 02:24:38,260
Okay.

3034
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:38,880
Oh, hey!

3035
02:24:39,020 --> 02:24:39,920
Old lady!

3036
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:41,000
Talk to me.

3037
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:42,380
I'm important.

3038
02:24:42,780 --> 02:24:42,880
Hello there.

3039
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:46,320
Oh, okay.

3040
02:24:49,080 --> 02:24:49,640
Hello.

3041
02:24:50,900 --> 02:24:51,840
Look, see?

3042
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:53,200
She talked to me!

3043
02:24:57,020 --> 02:24:59,000
Oh, she doesn't even have voice acting.

3044
02:24:59,560 --> 02:25:00,120
Oh, she doesn't even have voice acting.

3045
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:01,800
Like, oh, what the fuck?!

3046
02:25:01,820 --> 02:25:06,320
That old lady has voice acting and she doesn't?!

3047
02:25:06,320 --> 02:25:08,020
Hello there.

3048
02:25:08,780 --> 02:25:10,680
Wait, they all say hello there!

3049
02:25:11,040 --> 02:25:13,600
You have the same voice as the other old lady!

3050
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:14,720
You have the same voice as the other old lady!

3051
02:25:14,720 --> 02:25:16,740
Okay, at least we know it's not her.

3052
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:17,720
It's not just her.

3053
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:18,760
What the?!

3054
02:25:20,940 --> 02:25:21,460
Demons!

3055
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:22,620
Wait, he's me!

3056
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:24,860
Just like me!

3057
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:29,520
Take what you want.

3058
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:32,100
But I beg you, spare the children!

3059
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:33,440
The children?

3060
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:34,480
We're not crooks.

3061
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:36,160
You have nothing to fear from us.

3062
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,100
Um, hello?

3063
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:39,420
We're demons?

3064
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:41,900
You should absolutely fear us.

3065
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,160
We're scared.

3066
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:43,360
We're demons.

3067
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:45,760
Prince, that's not helping.

3068
02:25:45,900 --> 02:25:47,120
Keep quiet for a moment.

3069
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:50,060
Sorry for frightening you.

3070
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:52,280
We merely want to ask you something.

3071
02:25:52,940 --> 02:25:53,360
Oh?

3072
02:25:54,840 --> 02:25:55,480
What?

3073
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:58,180
We're headed south.

3074
02:25:58,500 --> 02:25:59,500
No of us safe.

3075
02:25:59,520 --> 02:26:00,300
We have a safe route we can take.

3076
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:02,500
South?

3077
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:06,420
I don't have good news for you.

3078
02:26:06,640 --> 02:26:06,960
What?

3079
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:07,860
Why not?

3080
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:12,040
The royal army has blockaded off all routes headed south of here.

3081
02:26:12,320 --> 02:26:13,920
No getting past them.

3082
02:26:14,800 --> 02:26:16,680
And there's no way around?

3083
02:26:17,860 --> 02:26:18,460
And there's no way around?

3084
02:26:18,460 --> 02:26:19,040
Mmm...

3085
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:22,200
Only if you can make it across the East Valley.

3086
02:26:22,680 --> 02:26:23,040
Only if you can make it across the East Valley.

3087
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:25,040
There's no bridge though.

3088
02:26:25,180 --> 02:26:26,880
It collapsed a short while ago.

3089
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:28,520
I'll make my own bridge!

3090
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:36,040
If I shoot enough rocks on the side, it'll start piling up on the ground that like a bridge will show up.

3091
02:26:36,760 --> 02:26:38,640
If you think about it.

3092
02:26:38,980 --> 02:26:45,040
If you keep throwing rocks in the pit, the rocks will eventually pile up into a bridge.

3093
02:26:45,060 --> 02:26:45,340
the rocks will eventually pile up into a bridge.

3094
02:26:45,360 --> 02:26:45,440
the rocks will eventually pile up into a bridge.

3095
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:46,520
You know these parts better than me.

3096
02:26:47,280 --> 02:26:49,040
That old guy over there?

3097
02:26:51,020 --> 02:26:51,880
It's true.

3098
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:52,800
It's called engineering.

3099
02:26:53,780 --> 02:26:55,400
Engineers will vouch for me.

3100
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:56,360
Right?

3101
02:26:56,360 --> 02:26:58,100
Engineers in chat!

3102
02:26:58,280 --> 02:26:58,780
Am I right?

3103
02:27:00,380 --> 02:27:02,300
And there's only one answer.

3104
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:06,080
Very true.

3105
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:09,520
Masterclass of terraforming.

3106
02:27:12,030 --> 02:27:14,360
I like how all the kids have like voice acting.

3107
02:27:20,020 --> 02:27:21,740
Oh, I'm cute!

3108
02:27:26,420 --> 02:27:28,320
You're adorable too, mister!

3109
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:31,220
Take that back!

3110
02:27:31,460 --> 02:27:32,980
No one's scarier than me!

3111
02:27:33,340 --> 02:27:34,280
Bro, you're old!

3112
02:27:35,720 --> 02:27:37,780
Looks like we're in the same boat!

3113
02:27:38,540 --> 02:27:40,000
Well, people aren't scary.

3114
02:27:40,260 --> 02:27:41,000
You just push them.

3115
02:27:41,260 --> 02:27:44,360
And then there'll be a problem.

3116
02:27:49,980 --> 02:27:52,340
And then you gotta make sure you don't get sued.

3117
02:27:52,800 --> 02:27:54,120
Fix the bridge for us, would ya?

3118
02:27:56,360 --> 02:27:57,060
How would I do that?

3119
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:59,220
Look at the state of this town.

3120
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:04,460
We have neither the people nor the resources to fix the bridge.

3121
02:28:05,660 --> 02:28:06,260
Hmm...

3122
02:28:06,260 --> 02:28:09,940
In that case, our only option is to penetrate the blockade.

3123
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:10,920
That's what I'm saying!

3124
02:28:10,940 --> 02:28:11,660
They're not scary!

3125
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:13,600
Cause like, they're old.

3126
02:28:13,800 --> 02:28:14,280
They're weak.

3127
02:28:14,320 --> 02:28:14,460
You want to fight the army?

3128
02:28:14,740 --> 02:28:16,040
Count me out!

3129
02:28:16,740 --> 02:28:18,880
What other choice do we have?

3130
02:28:19,620 --> 02:28:22,380
Why are you so determined to travel south?

3131
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:25,400
We're hoping to find a spring.

3132
02:28:25,620 --> 02:28:26,340
An end to the war.

3133
02:28:26,360 --> 02:28:27,240
And the water shortage.

3134
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:30,520
There's like no muscle left in them.

3135
02:28:31,700 --> 02:28:36,620
But I don't see how you'd be able to cross that ravine without a bot that excels at jumping.

3136
02:28:37,480 --> 02:28:38,880
A jumping bot?

3137
02:28:39,320 --> 02:28:40,420
Where can we get one of those?

3138
02:28:40,420 --> 02:28:41,180
A jumping bot?

3139
02:28:41,580 --> 02:28:44,820
There are mentions of them in the rebel army's old files.

3140
02:28:45,900 --> 02:28:48,420
But I suppose you need a real jump bot.

3141
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:49,840
Not records of one.

3142
02:28:50,540 --> 02:28:53,900
Then again, that girl with you seemed to know her way around machines.

3143
02:28:54,360 --> 02:28:56,340
Should we try to pick her brain on the ground?

3144
02:28:57,580 --> 02:28:58,380
Good idea.

3145
02:28:58,820 --> 02:29:00,520
If anyone will know, it's her.

3146
02:29:02,900 --> 02:29:05,080
Alright, so we just had to talk to- Oh my god!

3147
02:29:05,120 --> 02:29:06,160
We're breaking into his home!

3148
02:29:07,100 --> 02:29:08,640
Oh I can't punch into his home.

3149
02:29:08,740 --> 02:29:09,660
Wait, that's your home?

3150
02:29:10,200 --> 02:29:11,360
Can I steal your water?

3151
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,680
Oh I can steal your books!

3152
02:29:13,140 --> 02:29:14,400
Oh it's just a diary.

3153
02:29:14,740 --> 02:29:15,500
Lango's diary.

3154
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:16,540
Oh it's lore!

3155
02:29:17,320 --> 02:29:18,460
Do I have skill points?

3156
02:29:18,600 --> 02:29:19,240
I don't.

3157
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:20,320
How do I look at lore?

3158
02:29:21,340 --> 02:29:23,060
Where the fuck is the lore?

3159
02:29:24,900 --> 02:29:27,620
Ohhhhh we're not looking at the lore!!

3160
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:30,280
Guys...

3161
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:33,780
It might look like we're never gonna look at lore...

3162
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:37,580
That's okay...

3163
02:29:37,580 --> 02:29:39,840
We never wanted to read anyway I guess.

3164
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:46,860
Wait, oh I forgot to talk to her.

3165
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:47,420
Or a quest.

3166
02:29:48,620 --> 02:29:49,940
Or for items?

3167
02:29:50,460 --> 02:29:51,360
Okay, what are these?

3168
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:59,420
Health drink, repair kit, firepower kit, B-grade steel, uh, steel, uh, sharp, shock-absorbing rubber.

3169
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:01,020
I don't need any of that.

3170
02:30:01,140 --> 02:30:01,920
I have enough loot.

3171
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:04,000
Alright.

3172
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:04,600
It's okay.

3173
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,080
We can't read anyway, guys.

3174
02:30:07,220 --> 02:30:07,880
It's okay.

3175
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:13,800
We never, we don't, finally, I can pretend, I don't have to pretend that I can read.

3176
02:30:16,820 --> 02:30:17,700
Thank God.

3177
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:22,620
Wait, who's that?

3178
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:24,900
Is that a demon or a cat?

3179
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,000
It's a cat!

3180
02:30:26,320 --> 02:30:27,480
She has paws.

3181
02:30:28,320 --> 02:30:29,780
He looks like a demon.

3182
02:30:29,780 --> 02:30:30,740
He has paws.

3183
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,700
Seen this guy before, thief?

3184
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:37,880
Nope.

3185
02:30:37,880 --> 02:30:39,000
Can't say I have.

3186
02:30:39,260 --> 02:30:41,020
Oh, just because he's a demon.

3187
02:30:41,340 --> 02:30:42,380
I know a lot of different kinds of demons, you know.

3188
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:46,420
You assume that just because he's a demon, he knows all the other demons?

3189
02:30:46,900 --> 02:30:47,420
Wow.

3190
02:30:48,640 --> 02:30:51,740
Stands to reason there would be entire types, even idols.

3191
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:53,240
That's fucked up.

3192
02:31:02,810 --> 02:31:05,810
What the fuck is that?

3193
02:31:07,950 --> 02:31:09,430
Where's his nose?

3194
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:18,080
Where the fuck is his nose?

3195
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,840
Hey, who are you?

3196
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:24,740
Don't beat me.

3197
02:31:25,540 --> 02:31:27,120
The name's Lassie.

3198
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:29,320
It's like, what if Majin Buu...

3199
02:31:29,320 --> 02:31:33,480
What if Majin Buu was really into cats?

3200
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:41,400
Cat Krillin.

3201
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:45,080
Wait,

3202
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:51,400
then what are you?

3203
02:31:52,880 --> 02:31:55,180
So, a cat-like thing.

3204
02:31:55,180 --> 02:31:56,960
Why were you sleeping here?

3205
02:31:58,520 --> 02:31:59,400
Wanna know?

3206
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:01,840
Then hand over something... rare.

3207
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:03,860
Majin Buu.

3208
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:05,960
Wait, that's good.

3209
02:32:06,820 --> 02:32:08,380
It's Majin Buu.

3210
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:12,220
Like this ancient coin.

3211
02:32:12,460 --> 02:32:14,500
You can usually find them in ruins.

3212
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:17,760
Is that a fucking cat?

3213
02:32:18,460 --> 02:32:20,100
Thank you for the super chat.

3214
02:32:20,260 --> 02:32:20,580
Thank you.

3215
02:32:21,900 --> 02:32:24,220
Oh, uh, thanks.

3216
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:25,160
I'm gonna go get some food.

3217
02:32:27,700 --> 02:32:28,340
What's that?

3218
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:31,580
You wanna trade this right back to me for something good, you say?

3219
02:32:32,600 --> 02:32:34,040
Oh yeah, of course.

3220
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:35,000
Wait, free loot.

3221
02:32:36,940 --> 02:32:38,180
Well, if you insist.

3222
02:32:38,460 --> 02:32:40,140
Take this storage capsule and exchange.

3223
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:41,260
A storage capsule.

3224
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:42,380
I can hold more gear.

3225
02:32:42,720 --> 02:32:46,200
This beauty right here can shrink even the biggest fuck down to pocket size.

3226
02:32:46,640 --> 02:32:48,920
Oh, it's capsules.

3227
02:32:49,260 --> 02:32:51,580
If you find something good in the ruins...

3228
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:52,460
It's all connected.

3229
02:32:54,240 --> 02:32:55,860
I'll give you something even better.

3230
02:32:55,860 --> 02:32:56,420
Capsule court.

3231
02:32:56,740 --> 02:32:57,140
See ya.

3232
02:32:58,440 --> 02:33:00,940
Oh my god, this is like a thousand...

3233
02:33:00,940 --> 02:33:02,360
Like, what the fuck?

3234
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:03,260
Where did he go?

3235
02:33:05,840 --> 02:33:06,720
Holy shit.

3236
02:33:06,860 --> 02:33:08,140
His people need him.

3237
02:33:08,580 --> 02:33:12,100
Oh my god, it's like a thousand years after the earth died.

3238
02:33:12,260 --> 02:33:12,780
Not after the earth died.

3239
02:33:12,840 --> 02:33:14,340
After the earth became sand land.

3240
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:18,080
We never so much as learned why he was sleeping there.

3241
02:33:20,460 --> 02:33:21,840
Code, thank you for the super chat.

3242
02:33:21,880 --> 02:33:22,180
Thank you.

3243
02:33:22,280 --> 02:33:22,640
Ma!

3244
02:33:22,960 --> 02:33:25,140
There's a weird fucking cat outside.

3245
02:33:26,060 --> 02:33:27,540
Thank you for the super chat.

3246
02:33:27,640 --> 02:33:27,920
Thank you.

3247
02:33:29,480 --> 02:33:30,500
Everything's connected.

3248
02:33:31,420 --> 02:33:33,560
It'll be incredibly useful down the road.

3249
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,820
The Toriyama multiverse.

3250
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:39,240
Technically there is.

3251
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:42,580
Because Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball Z had a crossover.

3252
02:33:44,180 --> 02:33:46,420
So there is a multiverse.

3253
02:33:46,860 --> 02:33:47,640
They all...

3254
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:50,340
Wouldn't dream of swiping it.

3255
02:33:50,340 --> 02:33:52,760
The cinematic universe.

3256
02:33:55,060 --> 02:33:55,700
Really?

3257
02:33:55,700 --> 02:33:57,760
The Toriyama cinematic universe is real.

3258
02:33:58,860 --> 02:33:59,420
Looks

3259
02:34:05,210 --> 02:34:06,150
brand new.

3260
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:09,810
Now she'll be able to stand a little rock and...

3261
02:34:09,810 --> 02:34:10,450
TCU.

3262
02:34:13,290 --> 02:34:15,550
Like I said, ace mechanic.

3263
02:34:16,410 --> 02:34:18,310
Just bring her in if she breaks again.

3264
02:34:21,170 --> 02:34:23,670
What about building us something new from scratch?

3265
02:34:26,190 --> 02:34:30,630
Look, I may be good, but it takes way too complicated to build from square one.

3266
02:34:33,050 --> 02:34:33,870
I'm not a tank.

3267
02:34:33,890 --> 02:34:34,430
A bot.

3268
02:34:34,650 --> 02:34:35,670
One that can jump.

3269
02:34:37,330 --> 02:34:38,070
Come again?

3270
02:34:39,770 --> 02:34:40,630
Oh my god.

3271
02:34:40,730 --> 02:34:42,390
My tank's gonna be able to jump?

3272
02:34:45,730 --> 02:34:46,950
Okay, I get it.

3273
02:34:49,050 --> 02:34:49,810
Solid plan.

3274
02:34:50,070 --> 02:34:51,410
Appeals to the gearhead in me.

3275
02:34:53,050 --> 02:34:55,310
Does that mean you think you can do it?

3276
02:34:55,430 --> 02:34:56,610
What the fuck is a jump?

3277
02:34:57,150 --> 02:34:57,550
Probably.

3278
02:34:57,810 --> 02:34:59,270
I'm trying to figure out...

3279
02:34:59,270 --> 02:35:00,390
If you give me a coreframe, that is.

3280
02:35:00,430 --> 02:35:01,290
A coreframe?

3281
02:35:01,330 --> 02:35:01,990
What's that?

3282
02:35:02,390 --> 02:35:03,030
A coreframe?

3283
02:35:03,030 --> 02:35:03,870
Yeah.

3284
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:05,510
Can you speak...

3285
02:35:05,510 --> 02:35:07,710
Can you rephrase that in apex terms?

3286
02:35:08,650 --> 02:35:11,970
Remember how I said I can't build a tank from scratch?

3287
02:35:14,430 --> 02:35:18,710
That's because I don't have and can't build its most complex inner workings.

3288
02:35:19,710 --> 02:35:20,570
Jump bot?

3289
02:35:20,750 --> 02:35:21,810
Same deal.

3290
02:35:21,990 --> 02:35:24,050
I need the core parts to get started.

3291
02:35:25,690 --> 02:35:27,250
Well, that's a bummer.

3292
02:35:27,410 --> 02:35:29,310
We don't have a coreframe.

3293
02:35:29,350 --> 02:35:29,790
Not yet.

3294
02:35:30,910 --> 02:35:32,930
She's gotta find another tank system.

3295
02:35:33,030 --> 02:35:33,350
Simulate.

3296
02:35:44,610 --> 02:35:45,880
A junkers market?

3297
02:35:58,540 --> 02:36:01,100
She just needs an octane pad.

3298
02:36:04,040 --> 02:36:04,860
Thanks, man.

3299
02:36:04,880 --> 02:36:05,020
Thanks, guys.

3300
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:07,400
Thanks for explaining it in apex terms, guys.

3301
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:08,780
It was really helpful.

3302
02:36:09,300 --> 02:36:15,440
It's so weird whenever there's like a little... like I can't move before like the quest thing goes like quest complete.

3303
02:36:15,540 --> 02:36:20,080
So every time that little like pause, I'm like, why can't I move?

3304
02:36:20,340 --> 02:36:21,540
Is my game bugged?

3305
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:23,880
You can use the garage.

3306
02:36:24,180 --> 02:36:27,820
There you can create, upgrade and switch vehicle parts as well as choose which vehicle to use.

3307
02:36:27,960 --> 02:36:29,460
Wait, I can use more than one vehicle?

3308
02:36:30,060 --> 02:36:33,280
Spindle will grow as you complete side quests, gaining new build...

3309
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:34,140
Oh my god!

3310
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:36,740
It's like Animal Crossing 2!

3311
02:36:38,300 --> 02:36:39,720
The more I do...

3312
02:36:39,720 --> 02:36:40,840
Oh my god, dude, it's like...

3313
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:41,940
It's like anime Fallout!

3314
02:36:43,900 --> 02:36:46,020
Oh my god, this game has everything!

3315
02:36:46,740 --> 02:36:50,820
Anime Fallout 4, anime Mad Max.

3316
02:36:54,060 --> 02:36:55,680
This game has everything!

3317
02:36:59,620 --> 02:37:02,120
Gaining new buildings and then cabinets.

3318
02:37:02,240 --> 02:37:04,100
As you go along, you might find new...

3319
02:37:04,100 --> 02:37:04,120
Oh, I can't.

3320
02:37:04,120 --> 02:37:04,480
I was just about to say that.

3321
02:37:04,480 --> 02:37:07,700
It's like, you can get new stores and new products and existing stores.

3322
02:37:07,740 --> 02:37:09,760
Completing side quests is most certainly to your benefit.

3323
02:37:11,080 --> 02:37:14,540
Anime World of Tanks and Anime World of Thunder!

3324
02:37:14,760 --> 02:37:15,680
It has everything.

3325
02:37:20,460 --> 02:37:20,860
Alright.

3326
02:37:21,140 --> 02:37:22,180
Let me know if you want to upgrade.

3327
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:25,360
Just bring me the material and I'll have it souped up and raring to go!

3328
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:26,260
Does she just live here?

3329
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:27,880
Wait, she's not going to be my...

3330
02:37:27,880 --> 02:37:30,460
She's not going to like follow me anywhere?

3331
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:31,460
No!

3332
02:37:32,180 --> 02:37:32,980
No more...

3333
02:37:32,980 --> 02:37:34,100
What the fuck...

3334
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:34,100
Look!

3335
02:37:34,700 --> 02:37:38,880
We need like at least like one female in this team.

3336
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:40,660
Guys, this is getting it.

3337
02:37:40,760 --> 02:37:41,900
There's too many guys here.

3338
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:43,440
We need to diversify.

3339
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:57,800
It's like, it's like those like, uh, like those like, uh, like shows where there's always like the one, the one female to make sure, to make sure the team has everybody.

3340
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:01,240
It's just too old guys.

3341
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:03,900
Too many old people.

3342
02:38:04,040 --> 02:38:05,260
Someone please pick female.

3343
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:24,000
Oh, wait, she's back?

3344
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:24,920
What the f-?

3345
02:38:26,140 --> 02:38:26,660
Wait!

3346
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:27,480
Oh my god!

3347
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:28,760
She didn't leave!

3348
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:30,220
Thank god!

3349
02:38:31,080 --> 02:38:32,800
Now this team is balanced.

3350
02:38:33,900 --> 02:38:35,760
This team is balanced now.

3351
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,040
Yay!

3352
02:38:49,540 --> 02:38:51,780
This is the team guys!

3353
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:53,660
Oh, thank god.

3354
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,360
We're like, we're like chipping down rescue rangers!

3355
02:38:58,440 --> 02:39:00,120
Oh my- Wait, where did she go?

3356
02:39:02,460 --> 02:39:04,320
She just wants to shop.

3357
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:06,140
She's only here to shop.

3358
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:10,160
The dream team.

3359
02:39:10,340 --> 02:39:12,760
Out of the chipping down rescue rangers!

3360
02:39:14,980 --> 02:39:16,520
This is basically it!

3361
02:39:17,980 --> 02:39:19,500
What a team.

3362
02:39:19,860 --> 02:39:20,900
I'm Chip.

3363
02:39:21,540 --> 02:39:24,080
He's Dale, cause we're both the same height.

3364
02:39:24,420 --> 02:39:27,780
He's the, uh, that, that- I forgot the name.

3365
02:39:27,780 --> 02:39:30,140
The guy with the funky- Cause he has a mustache too!

3366
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:32,620
He also has a mustache!

3367
02:39:33,420 --> 02:39:34,620
Oh my god!

3368
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,440
We're literally ch- And then- And then!

3369
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:39,620
She's the- The female one!

3370
02:39:43,480 --> 02:39:44,900
She's- He's Launchpad!

3371
02:39:47,180 --> 02:39:48,240
Who's the fly?

3372
02:39:48,500 --> 02:39:49,600
The fly's the tank.

3373
02:39:49,880 --> 02:39:51,940
That's who- That's who's the fly.

3374
02:39:55,620 --> 02:39:57,700
The fly's the tank guys.

3375
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:01,160
Gadget!

3376
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:01,860
Yeah, gadget!

3377
02:40:09,330 --> 02:40:09,670
Alright.

3378
02:40:09,950 --> 02:40:11,590
So I can...

3379
02:40:12,570 --> 02:40:13,250
Uh...

3380
02:40:14,530 --> 02:40:19,110
Look, the only people I remember in the Chippendale rescue ranger- Like the names.

3381
02:40:19,410 --> 02:40:24,130
The only names I remember from the Chippendale rescue rangers was Chippendale.

3382
02:40:24,350 --> 02:40:28,030
Because they- Because it's Chippendale!

3383
02:40:28,930 --> 02:40:31,590
I really don't know any of the other names.

3384
02:40:31,730 --> 02:40:37,150
I just remember the female rat, the rat with the fucking mustache, and the fly.

3385
02:40:42,440 --> 02:40:44,040
Literally the title.

3386
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:46,120
There was a fat cat?

3387
02:40:46,340 --> 02:40:46,860
Oh yeah!

3388
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:48,180
There was a fat cat!

3389
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:50,500
Cause he was fat and was a cat!

3390
02:40:50,980 --> 02:40:51,500
Alright.

3391
02:40:51,880 --> 02:40:53,320
Capsule menu, choose vehicle.

3392
02:40:53,800 --> 02:40:54,860
Uh, okay.

3393
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:56,840
The vehicle inside a capsule can be charged.

3394
02:40:56,940 --> 02:40:57,600
Change the cap.

3395
02:40:57,600 --> 02:40:59,620
I only have one tank though.

3396
02:40:59,880 --> 02:41:00,400
Dangerous.

3397
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:03,400
Enemies on a map such as monsters will attack you.

3398
02:41:03,460 --> 02:41:06,480
Enemies are- are high-level so watch out.

3399
02:41:06,580 --> 02:41:06,840
Okay.

3400
02:41:08,360 --> 02:41:08,880
Uh...

3401
02:41:08,880 --> 02:41:13,160
How did you forget about a lord and savior gadget that created that one cult- Oh my god!

3402
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:21,020
Yeah, there was- there's a Russian cult surrounded- surrounded about the- the female rat gadget.

3403
02:41:21,440 --> 02:41:22,460
Oh my god!

3404
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:27,360
I'm gonna steal the- I'm gonna GTA this dinosaur.

3405
02:41:31,900 --> 02:41:32,420
Okay.

3406
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:33,060
Let's see.

3407
02:41:33,380 --> 02:41:35,640
Autopilot, jump, intimidate.

3408
02:41:35,660 --> 02:41:36,580
I can intimidate?

3409
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Monsters won't attack when you're riding a raptor so you can explore safe- how your raptor will run away.

3410
02:41:41,180 --> 02:41:42,580
My raptor's gonna run away?

3411
02:41:42,940 --> 02:41:44,360
I'm GTA-ing right now.

3412
02:41:44,720 --> 02:41:45,840
Okay, intimidate.

3413
02:41:46,040 --> 02:41:46,900
Oh, that's cool.

3414
02:41:47,840 --> 02:41:51,560
I don't like those little sack things on the back of its tail.

3415
02:41:51,700 --> 02:41:54,900
Because usually those sack things on the back of its tails...

3416
02:41:54,900 --> 02:41:57,340
For like, actual real life action.

3417
02:41:57,340 --> 02:41:58,540
Animals, Grand Theft Auto.

3418
02:41:58,860 --> 02:41:59,040
Yeah.

3419
02:42:00,260 --> 02:42:02,180
I'm GTD-ing right now.

3420
02:42:02,280 --> 02:42:03,200
Grand Theft Auto.

3421
02:42:05,140 --> 02:42:05,480
Okay.

3422
02:42:05,680 --> 02:42:08,420
For biology facts.

3423
02:42:08,740 --> 02:42:14,440
Usually when there's a huge sack behind- like for the animal, it is used for like...

3424
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:15,280
Um...

3425
02:42:16,220 --> 02:42:20,080
It is used for attracting the females.

3426
02:42:20,300 --> 02:42:21,520
What the fuck?

3427
02:42:25,370 --> 02:42:26,050
Okay.

3428
02:42:26,990 --> 02:42:27,670
Um...

3429
02:42:27,670 --> 02:42:28,590
Cool.

3430
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:30,110
Thank you, Donald.

3431
02:42:30,430 --> 02:42:33,610
But it's usually used for like, you know...

3432
02:42:33,610 --> 02:42:34,930
Mating purposes.

3433
02:42:35,270 --> 02:42:36,110
It is.

3434
02:42:40,410 --> 02:42:43,110
It's typical animal biology!

3435
02:42:45,710 --> 02:42:46,710
Where?

3436
02:42:46,930 --> 02:42:47,170
That?

3437
02:42:52,270 --> 02:42:54,670
This one's for sitting.

3438
02:42:58,710 --> 02:43:00,690
It's where the pheromones come out!

3439
02:43:01,050 --> 02:43:02,710
What the fuck is that?

3440
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:04,250
You tell my father and we're through!

3441
02:43:05,030 --> 02:43:06,370
Is that another Donald?

3442
02:43:06,690 --> 02:43:08,650
Oh my god, guys, we're gonna...

3443
02:43:08,650 --> 02:43:09,150
We're...

3444
02:43:10,690 --> 02:43:12,090
What is that?

3445
02:43:12,170 --> 02:43:12,930
Is that Donald?

3446
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:13,590
It's a traveler!

3447
02:43:14,310 --> 02:43:15,470
Oh my god!

3448
02:43:15,650 --> 02:43:17,130
Can my Donald...

3449
02:43:17,130 --> 02:43:18,650
My Donald needs a girlfriend!

3450
02:43:19,730 --> 02:43:24,010
Is it okay we do an arranged marriage between our Donalds?

3451
02:43:25,070 --> 02:43:25,630
Hello?

3452
02:43:26,730 --> 02:43:27,750
Oh, yeah, that...

3453
02:43:27,750 --> 02:43:28,990
This one has to be female.

3454
02:43:29,010 --> 02:43:29,670
Look, it's perfect!

3455
02:43:30,090 --> 02:43:30,850
You can tell...

3456
02:43:30,850 --> 02:43:32,510
You can tell that Donald is female!

3457
02:43:32,950 --> 02:43:34,270
Because my Donald's bigger!

3458
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:36,590
Oh my god, what if we just rob this guy?

3459
02:43:37,050 --> 02:43:38,250
Our Donald now.

3460
02:43:41,770 --> 02:43:43,150
Our Donald now!

3461
02:43:43,910 --> 02:43:44,350
Okay.

3462
02:43:45,330 --> 02:43:46,690
Let's see, we'll go this way.

3463
02:43:50,850 --> 02:43:51,910
Talk to that merchant?

3464
02:43:53,350 --> 02:43:53,790
Alright.

3465
02:43:54,170 --> 02:43:54,610
Okay.

3466
02:43:55,630 --> 02:43:55,810
Hello.

3467
02:43:56,030 --> 02:43:56,930
I wanna talk to you.

3468
02:43:59,230 --> 02:44:03,130
Raptors and Wani prowl the road to the battleship.

3469
02:44:03,330 --> 02:44:06,030
I've been losing sleep worrying about them getting my cargo.

3470
02:44:06,230 --> 02:44:06,690
Is that it?

3471
02:44:08,050 --> 02:44:09,050
Dark energy.

3472
02:44:09,950 --> 02:44:11,490
Power of darkness?

3473
02:44:11,950 --> 02:44:13,770
What the fuck is power of darkness?

3474
02:44:15,470 --> 02:44:16,890
Can I like attack them?

3475
02:44:17,150 --> 02:44:18,510
Hello, friend?

3476
02:44:20,370 --> 02:44:20,650
Friend.

3477
02:44:22,630 --> 02:44:23,190
Hey.

3478
02:44:23,890 --> 02:44:25,030
Hey, the...

3479
02:44:26,210 --> 02:44:27,070
He's not looking.

3480
02:44:27,170 --> 02:44:27,930
You wanna come with us?

3481
02:44:32,030 --> 02:44:32,410
Look.

3482
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:34,430
She's busy with the kids.

3483
02:44:34,510 --> 02:44:35,290
You wanna come with us?

3484
02:44:41,210 --> 02:44:41,590
Alright,

3485
02:44:45,270 --> 02:44:45,850
let's see.

3486
02:44:48,050 --> 02:44:48,850
Where do we go?

3487
02:44:48,910 --> 02:44:49,650
Okay, we go this way.

3488
02:44:50,510 --> 02:44:50,890
2000.

3489
02:44:51,370 --> 02:44:52,070
That's so far.

3490
02:44:52,510 --> 02:44:53,590
But she's so fast though.

3491
02:44:53,610 --> 02:44:54,670
My dino's really fast.

3492
02:44:54,670 --> 02:44:55,970
Hey, baby girl.

3493
02:44:56,730 --> 02:44:57,410
Let's see.

3494
02:44:57,490 --> 02:44:58,690
What does the jumping look like?

3495
02:45:00,750 --> 02:45:02,650
Oh my god, loot!

3496
02:45:06,010 --> 02:45:08,230
Oh, I can loot here too.

3497
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:12,390
Hey there.

3498
02:45:13,050 --> 02:45:14,170
Hey, baby girl.

3499
02:45:17,430 --> 02:45:19,770
I show you my thermones.

3500
02:45:20,330 --> 02:45:20,910
Hahaha!

3501
02:45:22,430 --> 02:45:22,650
Hahaha!

3502
02:45:24,750 --> 02:45:25,990
Please respond!

3503
02:45:26,450 --> 02:45:27,670
I think it-

3504
02:45:32,310 --> 02:45:34,330
The key, please!

3505
02:45:36,910 --> 02:45:37,590
What?

3506
02:45:43,130 --> 02:45:44,510
What did I do?

3507
02:45:48,530 --> 02:45:51,430
The ocean's right outside of Sand Land, isn't it?

3508
02:45:51,430 --> 02:45:52,630
Wait, can I farm with you?

3509
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:54,590
Oh, I can farm with my dino!

3510
02:45:54,710 --> 02:45:55,490
It's so convenient!

3511
02:45:55,910 --> 02:46:00,750
I like how they're just following me from the back too.

3512
02:46:03,930 --> 02:46:06,370
I totally showed you my tail, bub.

3513
02:46:06,450 --> 02:46:07,450
Please respond.

3514
02:46:09,050 --> 02:46:10,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

3515
02:46:10,850 --> 02:46:11,730
I didn't do anything wrong.

3516
02:46:13,010 --> 02:46:19,590
I like how... I think my favorite part is that even though I'm on the dino, they have to run after me.

3517
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:24,430
I think that's the funniest part.

3518
02:46:24,810 --> 02:46:28,710
They have to like... they don't get any type of transportation.

3519
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:31,350
They gotta follow me.

3520
02:46:33,870 --> 02:46:34,610
Let's see.

3521
02:46:34,850 --> 02:46:36,190
I wanna go to a radio tower.

3522
02:46:38,350 --> 02:46:38,950
Parkour!

3523
02:46:39,250 --> 02:46:40,290
Dino parkour!

3524
02:46:40,750 --> 02:46:41,410
Let's go.

3525
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:44,130
There's like something here.

3526
02:46:44,190 --> 02:46:45,350
Wait, is that town over there?

3527
02:46:45,610 --> 02:46:47,730
There's like so much... Yeah!

3528
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:50,830
It's all over Sandland.

3529
02:46:51,990 --> 02:46:52,510
Wait.

3530
02:46:52,670 --> 02:46:53,090
No!

3531
02:46:53,290 --> 02:46:54,410
Don't shoot my guy!

3532
02:46:56,210 --> 02:46:57,250
Don't shoot him!

3533
02:46:58,090 --> 02:47:00,030
Okay, I'm gonna park you right here.

3534
02:47:00,150 --> 02:47:01,030
I don't wanna lose you.

3535
02:47:01,790 --> 02:47:02,310
Okay?

3536
02:47:02,410 --> 02:47:03,270
You're gonna stay here.

3537
02:47:03,370 --> 02:47:04,350
Stay here, okay?

3538
02:47:04,930 --> 02:47:05,670
Stay here!

3539
02:47:06,690 --> 02:47:08,710
I need the loot!

3540
02:47:09,330 --> 02:47:10,950
I can't lose the dino.

3541
02:47:10,970 --> 02:47:12,070
It's actually so convenient.

3542
02:47:12,770 --> 02:47:13,950
Wait, is that missile?

3543
02:47:14,390 --> 02:47:16,370
Oh my god, he has a fucking missile.

3544
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:19,090
It's fine.

3545
02:47:19,210 --> 02:47:19,830
I'm stronger.

3546
02:47:20,110 --> 02:47:21,250
He can't aim.

3547
02:47:21,370 --> 02:47:22,750
They're like star troopers.

3548
02:47:22,910 --> 02:47:23,730
Or stormtroopers.

3549
02:47:26,070 --> 02:47:26,590
Yeah.

3550
02:47:28,410 --> 02:47:29,810
No, don't run away!

3551
02:47:30,130 --> 02:47:30,810
No, I parked him!

3552
02:47:32,150 --> 02:47:34,070
I parked the raptor, guys!

3553
02:47:34,390 --> 02:47:35,330
There's no way!

3554
02:47:35,830 --> 02:47:36,330
No!

3555
02:47:36,590 --> 02:47:37,590
Don't say that!

3556
02:47:40,130 --> 02:47:41,350
Use materials to repair.

3557
02:47:41,510 --> 02:47:44,010
Once repaired, tower will provide you with a map of the icon.

3558
02:47:44,570 --> 02:47:45,130
Can I?

3559
02:47:46,370 --> 02:47:46,790
Can I though?

3560
02:47:48,150 --> 02:47:50,010
I parked the raptor!

3561
02:47:59,010 --> 02:48:00,330
There's no way.

3562
02:48:00,330 --> 02:48:01,270
There's no way.

3563
02:48:01,490 --> 02:48:03,130
We had like a bond.

3564
02:48:03,790 --> 02:48:05,090
There's no way.

3565
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:08,250
The raptor and I had a bond.

3566
02:48:08,550 --> 02:48:09,850
Where did he go?

3567
02:48:15,260 --> 02:48:15,900
No!

3568
02:48:15,900 --> 02:48:18,240
I parked you and everything!

3569
02:48:18,240 --> 02:48:19,560
What?

3570
02:48:20,040 --> 02:48:22,400
Guys, I got dino jacked!

3571
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:23,060
There's no way.

3572
02:48:23,120 --> 02:48:24,100
He would never run away.

3573
02:48:24,300 --> 02:48:25,820
Someone jacked my dino.

3574
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:28,680
Guys!

3575
02:48:28,900 --> 02:48:29,500
Guys!

3576
02:48:31,740 --> 02:48:33,200
There's been a robbery!

3577
02:48:37,620 --> 02:48:39,860
Somebody jacked my dino!

3578
02:48:43,800 --> 02:48:46,260
I've been dino jacked!

3579
02:48:47,240 --> 02:48:48,580
This is serious!

3580
02:48:49,740 --> 02:48:51,800
Crime is not a joke!

3581
02:48:54,240 --> 02:48:58,300
According to the map, this area is near the center of Sandland.

3582
02:48:59,380 --> 02:49:01,860
Someone GTA'd the dino I GTA'd.

3583
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:03,640
I can't believe it.

3584
02:49:03,880 --> 02:49:05,700
I can't believe it.

3585
02:49:05,860 --> 02:49:09,480
The steep cliffs make traveling north or south of here a serious challenge.

3586
02:49:10,040 --> 02:49:12,880
I can't believe someone downloaded my dino.

3587
02:49:17,090 --> 02:49:17,910
Let's see.

3588
02:49:18,010 --> 02:49:18,570
Where is it?

3589
02:49:18,570 --> 02:49:19,010
Where do I go?

3590
02:49:19,090 --> 02:49:20,190
I'm lost now.

3591
02:49:20,850 --> 02:49:21,810
Oh my god.

3592
02:49:21,810 --> 02:49:23,370
I've been trying to get to this cave.

3593
02:49:23,550 --> 02:49:24,170
Oh no!

3594
02:49:24,850 --> 02:49:26,970
Guys, I think I'm a little lost.

3595
02:49:29,450 --> 02:49:30,650
I'm so sad.

3596
02:49:31,270 --> 02:49:32,970
Guys, I'm so sad.

3597
02:49:33,690 --> 02:49:34,710
We gotta file.

3598
02:49:34,830 --> 02:49:35,850
We gotta call the cops.

3599
02:49:36,070 --> 02:49:37,430
We gotta file a police report.

3600
02:49:38,130 --> 02:49:39,370
This is important!

3601
02:49:43,010 --> 02:49:44,890
My fucking car!

3602
02:49:46,750 --> 02:49:47,570
Oh god.

3603
02:49:47,670 --> 02:49:47,930
Whoa!

3604
02:49:49,810 --> 02:49:51,130
I'm so sad.

3605
02:49:56,590 --> 02:49:59,230
How... How am I going to cope?

3606
02:49:59,710 --> 02:50:01,450
This is not the same.

3607
02:50:03,350 --> 02:50:04,450
Oh my god!

3608
02:50:04,630 --> 02:50:05,070
Wait!

3609
02:50:05,350 --> 02:50:06,090
A simulate!

3610
02:50:06,250 --> 02:50:07,570
It's time for a simulation!

3611
02:50:08,430 --> 02:50:10,090
It's a simulation time.

3612
02:50:11,150 --> 02:50:12,710
Alright, nice.

3613
02:50:13,890 --> 02:50:15,030
Guys, it's okay.

3614
02:50:15,130 --> 02:50:16,770
It exploded but they'll be okay.

3615
02:50:16,770 --> 02:50:20,550
You gotta remember there's no fatalities here.

3616
02:50:23,970 --> 02:50:25,050
A simulate.

3617
02:50:25,450 --> 02:50:26,490
Oh, he found money!

3618
02:50:27,770 --> 02:50:28,370
Nice.

3619
02:50:31,370 --> 02:50:31,970
Alright.

3620
02:50:32,130 --> 02:50:33,610
There has to be loot in here.

3621
02:50:34,510 --> 02:50:35,590
Consume the metal.

3622
02:50:37,870 --> 02:50:39,630
Return to the mother tank.

3623
02:50:40,590 --> 02:50:41,470
Alright, loot.

3624
02:50:41,830 --> 02:50:42,430
Loot.

3625
02:50:42,590 --> 02:50:43,170
Yeah!

3626
02:50:43,330 --> 02:50:43,790
Loot!

3627
02:50:43,890 --> 02:50:46,750
According to the map, this area is near the center of the cave.

3628
02:50:47,510 --> 02:50:48,910
This is the center?

3629
02:50:49,210 --> 02:50:49,230
This is the center?

3630
02:50:49,370 --> 02:50:52,310
So we can reach a bunch of places from here, huh?

3631
02:50:52,450 --> 02:50:53,470
Wait, where did my tank go?

3632
02:50:53,490 --> 02:50:54,830
Did I got fucking GTT'd?

3633
02:50:55,130 --> 02:50:55,250
Not really.

3634
02:50:55,250 --> 02:50:59,470
The steep cliffs make traveling north or south of here a serious challenge.

3635
02:51:00,530 --> 02:51:02,930
Pretty inconvenient for a central hub.

3636
02:51:04,210 --> 02:51:05,850
I almost got... I can't believe it.

3637
02:51:05,870 --> 02:51:07,050
I almost got Grand Theft Tank.

3638
02:51:07,790 --> 02:51:08,530
But it's okay.

3639
02:51:08,610 --> 02:51:09,650
I have more capsules.

3640
02:51:11,910 --> 02:51:15,530
But if there's a whole junkers market right below...

3641
02:51:15,530 --> 02:51:15,630
Look!

3642
02:51:15,630 --> 02:51:16,210
Oh my god, loot!

3643
02:51:17,110 --> 02:51:21,510
Surely those junkers have long since stripped it of anything valuable.

3644
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:24,270
My loot now.

3645
02:51:24,650 --> 02:51:26,010
If that's true, a core frame for a jump bot...

3646
02:51:26,750 --> 02:51:28,890
...is probably gonna cost us a pretty penny.

3647
02:51:29,150 --> 02:51:30,050
It's okay, guys.

3648
02:51:30,930 --> 02:51:33,430
I've been... I've been a loot goblin.

3649
02:51:33,570 --> 02:51:34,830
We have so much loot.

3650
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:37,450
We're so rich now.

3651
02:51:39,230 --> 02:51:40,350
Oh no, I have to reload.

3652
02:51:41,410 --> 02:51:42,150
Don't worry.

3653
02:51:42,830 --> 02:51:45,410
We're gonna kill some scorpions.

3654
02:51:46,790 --> 02:51:48,630
This has to be enough money.

3655
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:50,590
Oh my god, there's more loot!

3656
02:51:52,190 --> 02:51:54,490
Let's go into this suspiciously dark cave.

3657
02:51:56,630 --> 02:51:57,310
Let's not.

3658
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:01,210
Get in the tank!

3659
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:03,690
Get in the tank, bees above!

3660
02:52:07,850 --> 02:52:08,330
Okay.

3661
02:52:08,970 --> 02:52:09,590
It's okay.

3662
02:52:09,710 --> 02:52:12,050
He's not gonna slap me while I bring out the tank, right?

3663
02:52:12,110 --> 02:52:12,330
Oh!

3664
02:52:13,090 --> 02:52:13,430
Oh!

3665
02:52:13,590 --> 02:52:15,130
He definitely slapped me.

3666
02:52:15,710 --> 02:52:16,190
What?

3667
02:52:17,370 --> 02:52:19,210
Get in the pocket tank!

3668
02:52:20,990 --> 02:52:21,870
There we go.

3669
02:52:22,710 --> 02:52:23,350
Boom.

3670
02:52:23,570 --> 02:52:24,230
There we go.

3671
02:52:24,890 --> 02:52:26,450
Now I can...

3672
02:52:27,590 --> 02:52:31,150
Now I can loot the suspiciously dark cave.

3673
02:52:32,830 --> 02:52:33,470
Yay!

3674
02:52:34,030 --> 02:52:35,170
Another loot page!

3675
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:37,190
Man, I sure wish I could read.

3676
02:52:38,510 --> 02:52:39,150
Loot.

3677
02:52:39,930 --> 02:52:40,570
Loot.

3678
02:52:40,570 --> 02:52:42,910
We need to keep our bearings passing between the cliffs.

3679
02:52:44,830 --> 02:52:46,070
It's easy to lose them.

3680
02:52:46,070 --> 02:52:46,290
Gotta have that loot!

3681
02:52:46,290 --> 02:52:47,030
Gotta have that loot!

3682
02:52:53,050 --> 02:52:56,330
Guys, I know how to read the map.

3683
02:52:56,710 --> 02:52:58,170
I might be illiterate.

3684
02:52:58,190 --> 02:52:59,630
But I can look at picture books.

3685
02:53:01,090 --> 02:53:02,250
Do I need...

3686
02:53:02,250 --> 02:53:03,870
Do I need... To drink water?

3687
02:53:04,790 --> 02:53:06,570
Nah, we don't need to stay hydrated.

3688
02:53:09,730 --> 02:53:10,350
All right.

3689
02:53:10,350 --> 02:53:11,710
We gotta...

3690
02:53:13,230 --> 02:53:13,770
All right.

3691
02:53:13,770 --> 02:53:15,430
Okay, let's kill these scorpions for more loot.

3692
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:18,010
And then we'll run over the babies.

3693
02:53:21,190 --> 02:53:23,810
Okay, we'll attempt to run over the babies.

3694
02:53:25,830 --> 02:53:27,350
Water is for the weak.

3695
02:53:28,710 --> 02:53:29,950
Is there more loot over here?

3696
02:53:30,050 --> 02:53:30,330
Can I?

3697
02:53:31,250 --> 02:53:31,650
No.

3698
02:53:31,810 --> 02:53:33,150
Aw, it's like too far up.

3699
02:53:33,810 --> 02:53:36,330
Okay, we'll go this way, I assume.

3700
02:53:36,970 --> 02:53:38,110
Fine, we're almost there!

3701
02:53:40,290 --> 02:53:41,550
Jonesy, thank you for the super chat!

3702
02:53:41,650 --> 02:53:42,330
Thank you, thank you!

3703
02:53:42,410 --> 02:53:43,290
Wait, what's up here?

3704
02:53:46,390 --> 02:53:48,250
Don't worry, I'm gonna help you!

3705
02:53:53,050 --> 02:53:54,850
My job here is done.

3706
02:53:56,910 --> 02:53:58,050
Get over here!

3707
02:54:00,350 --> 02:54:02,390
How the fuck did I get... Oh, I get up from here!

3708
02:54:09,930 --> 02:54:11,210
I did it!

3709
02:54:11,350 --> 02:54:12,110
I helped!

3710
02:54:12,230 --> 02:54:15,310
There's ruins here?

3711
02:54:15,430 --> 02:54:17,510
There's ruins here?

3712
02:54:18,570 --> 02:54:22,170
Throughout your travels, you'll encounter people attacked by monsters or gangs.

3713
02:54:22,290 --> 02:54:23,310
Save them and your...

3714
02:54:23,310 --> 02:54:25,570
I love getting rewarded for my efforts!

3715
02:54:30,110 --> 02:54:31,190
Alright, pay up.

3716
02:54:34,270 --> 02:54:35,190
Pay up!

3717
02:54:36,290 --> 02:54:37,510
My fees aren't cheap.

3718
02:54:40,790 --> 02:54:42,010
Jonesy, thank you for the super chat!

3719
02:54:42,150 --> 02:54:42,790
Thank you, thank you!

3720
02:54:42,810 --> 02:54:43,370
Hi, Doki.

3721
02:54:43,470 --> 02:54:45,410
With all the sand you find, it's coarse, rough, and dirty.

3722
02:54:45,410 --> 02:54:45,630
I'm not irritating.

3723
02:54:45,870 --> 02:54:46,850
Does it get everywhere?

3724
02:54:47,090 --> 02:54:48,170
I fucking hate sand.

3725
02:54:48,750 --> 02:54:50,750
I say yes, I play Sand Land.

3726
02:54:50,990 --> 02:54:52,090
Wait, what's my...

3727
02:54:52,090 --> 02:54:53,870
Did he give me anything?

3728
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:55,670
What did he give me?

3729
02:54:57,810 --> 02:54:58,730
What the fuck?

3730
02:54:59,010 --> 02:55:00,790
I don't do good things for free!

3731
02:55:02,770 --> 02:55:04,370
There's a price for everything.

3732
02:55:06,150 --> 02:55:07,970
Oh my god, two bullets and he's dead.

3733
02:55:08,070 --> 02:55:09,110
That has to be a baby.

3734
02:55:10,310 --> 02:55:10,750
Scammed.

3735
02:55:10,790 --> 02:55:11,910
I can't believe it.

3736
02:55:11,930 --> 02:55:12,770
I got scammed.

3737
02:55:12,770 --> 02:55:14,730
You should have given me his bag.

3738
02:55:20,450 --> 02:55:21,230
What's this?

3739
02:55:21,950 --> 02:55:22,550
Ooh!

3740
02:55:23,890 --> 02:55:25,050
What is this ruins?

3741
02:55:26,850 --> 02:55:29,110
There's so many baby scorpions here.

3742
02:55:29,950 --> 02:55:31,410
I beat up a bug.

3743
02:55:32,290 --> 02:55:32,890
Nice.

3744
02:55:33,950 --> 02:55:35,110
Holy shit!

3745
02:55:35,190 --> 02:55:36,770
Can I summon a fucking tank here?

3746
02:55:38,030 --> 02:55:39,230
Oh my god!

3747
02:55:41,390 --> 02:55:44,050
There's no Professor Oak here to stop me!

3748
02:55:47,150 --> 02:55:48,450
Oh my god!

3749
02:55:49,690 --> 02:55:52,150
I can summon a tank indoors!

3750
02:55:56,990 --> 02:55:58,190
Holy shit!

3751
02:55:58,870 --> 02:56:01,930
I can ride my tank indoors, guys!

3752
02:56:01,990 --> 02:56:04,230
The ocean is right outside of Sand Land, isn't it?

3753
02:56:04,710 --> 02:56:06,170
Can't we get water from there?

3754
02:56:06,450 --> 02:56:09,290
Oh no, guys, my tank's a little thick.

3755
02:56:10,210 --> 02:56:13,370
I choose you, tank!

3756
02:56:14,170 --> 02:56:16,350
My tank was a little thick, guys.

3757
02:56:16,490 --> 02:56:21,090
Sand Land's surrounded by a vast desert and steep cliffs.

3758
02:56:22,390 --> 02:56:23,050
Dang!

3759
02:56:23,410 --> 02:56:26,010
Guess we really do need a water force.

3760
02:56:27,270 --> 02:56:27,930
Alright.

3761
02:56:28,470 --> 02:56:29,850
Okay, uh...

3762
02:56:30,370 --> 02:56:30,830
Nice.

3763
02:56:31,170 --> 02:56:33,070
Oh, no wonder I need a tank down here.

3764
02:56:33,170 --> 02:56:37,250
I was supposed to bring a tank down here to blast that.

3765
02:56:37,690 --> 02:56:38,290
Hello?

3766
02:56:38,850 --> 02:56:39,510
Whoa!

3767
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:40,330
Is this lore?

3768
02:56:40,610 --> 02:56:42,070
Is this demon ruins?

3769
02:56:45,410 --> 02:56:46,090
What's this?

3770
02:56:48,310 --> 02:56:49,130
Where do I go?

3771
02:56:49,530 --> 02:56:50,690
Oh, there's a door here.

3772
02:56:50,850 --> 02:56:51,190
Wait...

3773
02:56:51,190 --> 02:56:52,110
Is there...

3774
02:56:52,690 --> 02:56:55,570
Are those, like, beautiful old, ancient ruins?

3775
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:56,790
Let me destroy it.

3776
02:56:57,750 --> 02:57:00,950
Sorry, I got a little British there for a sec.

3777
02:57:01,310 --> 02:57:01,450
Oh, weird world, man.

3778
02:57:01,710 --> 02:57:04,210
Ruining all this to find water for other people.

3779
02:57:05,510 --> 02:57:06,770
I'm not that noble.

3780
02:57:08,110 --> 02:57:10,910
Only death can bring us if we don't help each other.

3781
02:57:11,570 --> 02:57:12,050
Oh, there's a door here!

3782
02:57:15,610 --> 02:57:17,250
Alright, we go this way.

3783
02:57:22,190 --> 02:57:23,570
I don't like that.

3784
02:57:23,750 --> 02:57:24,730
I don't like those bugs.

3785
02:57:24,870 --> 02:57:26,690
The ones with like million... the millipedes.

3786
02:57:28,950 --> 02:57:31,050
I have filled that museum.

3787
02:57:31,990 --> 02:57:33,490
That got too detailed.

3788
02:57:36,070 --> 02:57:36,850
What did I get?

3789
02:57:37,110 --> 02:57:40,170
I got an ancient gold... Oh, I got the gold coin for the cat!

3790
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:41,710
For Miao Jin Bu.

3791
02:57:44,210 --> 02:57:49,690
I guess that's what the coins... what the ruins are for.

3792
02:57:57,410 --> 02:58:00,150
If I don't look at them, they don't exist.

3793
02:58:05,410 --> 02:58:07,430
Oh, millipedes incentive...

3794
02:58:07,430 --> 02:58:10,150
I hate that.

3795
02:58:10,170 --> 02:58:10,350
I hate it.

3796
02:58:10,490 --> 02:58:11,190
I hate it.

3797
02:58:11,230 --> 02:58:11,650
I hate them.

3798
02:58:11,670 --> 02:58:14,630
Especially like they can be like really big too.

3799
02:58:18,230 --> 02:58:19,150
Alright, nice.

3800
02:58:20,550 --> 02:58:21,090
Okay.

3801
02:58:21,910 --> 02:58:23,210
Bring out the tank!

3802
02:58:27,140 --> 02:58:27,680
Deadpool,

3803
02:58:31,100 --> 02:58:32,700
thank you for the super chat.

3804
02:58:32,780 --> 02:58:33,160
Thank you.

3805
02:58:33,440 --> 02:58:33,960
Thank you.

3806
02:58:34,400 --> 02:58:36,040
Beatbros love millipedes.

3807
02:58:36,180 --> 02:58:39,000
You know I saw a short that's saying that like...

3808
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,150
The Prince Charming in Cinderella...

3809
02:58:43,100 --> 02:58:44,560
Um, is a feet guy.

3810
02:58:44,780 --> 02:58:52,280
Because who else would go like door to door for like thousands of... hundreds of towns trying to find his like...

3811
02:58:52,280 --> 02:58:54,160
with just a glass slipper.

3812
02:58:54,500 --> 02:58:55,440
Just think about that.

3813
02:58:58,820 --> 02:59:00,520
It makes sense guys.

3814
02:59:01,140 --> 02:59:02,400
It makes sense.

3815
02:59:03,660 --> 02:59:06,080
He's 100% a feet guy.

3816
02:59:12,010 --> 02:59:12,910
Hey guys.

3817
02:59:13,410 --> 02:59:14,990
I'm here for the jump bot.

3818
02:59:18,310 --> 02:59:19,030
Hello.

3819
02:59:19,090 --> 02:59:19,790
Hello.

3820
02:59:19,790 --> 02:59:21,370
Oh, you look like a bad guy.

3821
02:59:23,270 --> 02:59:25,750
It's romantic not a...

3822
02:59:25,750 --> 02:59:26,150
Sure.

3823
02:59:28,050 --> 02:59:30,230
You can tell yourself that.

3824
02:59:34,170 --> 02:59:41,330
And he somehow found the real person with the same feet size that he knew 100%.

3825
02:59:41,330 --> 02:59:42,210
Yeah.

3826
02:59:42,270 --> 02:59:44,190
After checking hundreds of people.

3827
02:59:44,190 --> 02:59:51,230
She was literally the only one that had the same foot size for the glass slipper.

3828
02:59:51,370 --> 02:59:52,690
Out of every...

3829
02:59:52,690 --> 02:59:53,870
How would he know?

3830
02:59:54,590 --> 02:59:55,350
Ha ha ha ha.

3831
02:59:55,910 --> 02:59:56,950
Ha ha ha ha.

3832
02:59:56,950 --> 02:59:57,910
Now scram.

3833
03:00:01,190 --> 03:00:02,590
Oh my god!

3834
03:00:04,290 --> 03:00:05,910
There's another dino!

3835
03:00:06,450 --> 03:00:07,810
Ha ha ha ha.

3836
03:00:08,330 --> 03:00:09,530
Oh my god.

3837
03:00:10,010 --> 03:00:12,990
There's another dino for me to GTD.

3838
03:00:14,290 --> 03:00:15,190
Alright, let's see.

3839
03:00:15,310 --> 03:00:17,990
I think I can like customize my vehicle, right?

3840
03:00:18,070 --> 03:00:18,970
I have like chips.

3841
03:00:19,730 --> 03:00:21,070
Oh, I need it locked.

3842
03:00:21,170 --> 03:00:22,050
It's like locked.

3843
03:00:22,890 --> 03:00:24,710
I need to like unlock it.

3844
03:00:27,570 --> 03:00:30,130
I feel like I don't need any of these power-ups, not gonna lie.

3845
03:00:31,050 --> 03:00:31,490
Hello.

3846
03:00:34,230 --> 03:00:34,670
Workshop.

3847
03:00:37,710 --> 03:00:39,090
I have so many mats.

3848
03:00:39,250 --> 03:00:40,390
I don't need to buy anything.

3849
03:00:42,070 --> 03:00:42,510
Okay.

3850
03:00:43,490 --> 03:00:44,410
Free dino.

3851
03:00:46,530 --> 03:00:48,450
Look, somebody stole my dino.

3852
03:00:48,510 --> 03:00:50,990
So I have the right to steal somebody else's dino.

3853
03:00:51,450 --> 03:00:52,150
It's a...

3854
03:00:53,770 --> 03:00:55,390
Demon is talking to me.

3855
03:00:55,970 --> 03:00:57,630
It's just the cycle of life.

3856
03:00:58,150 --> 03:00:58,650
No, no.

3857
03:00:58,750 --> 03:00:59,730
What should I do?

3858
03:01:00,330 --> 03:01:01,470
It's the end for me.

3859
03:01:02,190 --> 03:01:03,370
I don't wanna die.

3860
03:01:03,410 --> 03:01:04,350
Dino for dino.

3861
03:01:04,490 --> 03:01:05,450
Pay it forward.

3862
03:01:05,810 --> 03:01:07,530
What the heck are you going on about?

3863
03:01:08,010 --> 03:01:09,570
No one's trying to kill you.

3864
03:01:10,510 --> 03:01:12,490
But my granny told me I didn't want to die.

3865
03:01:12,490 --> 03:01:14,050
If a demon spoke to me.

3866
03:01:14,170 --> 03:01:15,930
Then why are you still alive?

3867
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:16,690
Yeah, why are you still alive?

3868
03:01:16,890 --> 03:01:18,030
Equivalent exchange, exactly.

3869
03:01:19,050 --> 03:01:19,970
You're right.

3870
03:01:20,090 --> 03:01:21,450
That is strange.

3871
03:01:22,210 --> 03:01:23,890
You are a demon, right?

3872
03:01:25,110 --> 03:01:26,390
Enough of this nonsense.

3873
03:01:26,850 --> 03:01:28,630
Give us the jump-off parts already.

3874
03:01:29,750 --> 03:01:31,970
I don't have anything like that.

3875
03:01:32,230 --> 03:01:33,250
You don't?

3876
03:01:33,250 --> 03:01:34,570
Then tell us who does.

3877
03:01:34,830 --> 03:01:35,730
Yeah, who has it?

3878
03:01:35,790 --> 03:01:36,870
So I can beat them up.

3879
03:01:37,370 --> 03:01:40,870
But I can't just keep talking to demons like this.

3880
03:01:40,870 --> 03:01:41,210
Why not?

3881
03:01:41,710 --> 03:01:43,190
Get to the point.

3882
03:01:43,330 --> 03:01:44,930
If you're scared of my words.

3883
03:01:45,050 --> 03:01:47,050
You don't want to see what my fists can do.

3884
03:01:47,070 --> 03:01:47,430
Yeah.

3885
03:01:47,470 --> 03:01:49,630
I punched a lot of baby dinosaurs.

3886
03:01:50,630 --> 03:01:52,110
And I felt nothing.

3887
03:01:54,650 --> 03:01:56,410
I have empathy, guys.

3888
03:01:57,510 --> 03:01:58,470
I swear.

3889
03:02:00,250 --> 03:02:01,950
He always has the latest info.

3890
03:02:03,090 --> 03:02:03,830
Poor, huh?

3891
03:02:04,410 --> 03:02:05,770
Let's go pay him a visit.

3892
03:02:06,750 --> 03:02:07,230
Alright.

3893
03:02:07,710 --> 03:02:08,990
I'll go pay him a visit.

3894
03:02:09,530 --> 03:02:11,190
Do you have stuff behind here that I can't see?

3895
03:02:11,190 --> 03:02:11,370
I mean, that I can rob?

3896
03:02:11,730 --> 03:02:12,730
I mean, borrow?

3897
03:02:13,310 --> 03:02:13,670
Wow!

3898
03:02:14,190 --> 03:02:15,590
Look at all these gems!

3899
03:02:16,610 --> 03:02:17,090
Gems?

3900
03:02:17,490 --> 03:02:18,090
Can I look around a bit?

3901
03:02:19,070 --> 03:02:19,550
Sure.

3902
03:02:19,790 --> 03:02:20,830
But don't get lost.

3903
03:02:22,410 --> 03:02:23,190
Oh my god.

3904
03:02:23,230 --> 03:02:25,970
He's like the dad in the team.

3905
03:02:26,130 --> 03:02:27,010
I told you!

3906
03:02:27,090 --> 03:02:29,190
It's just like Chip and Deb Rescue Rangers!

3907
03:02:30,230 --> 03:02:31,450
He's just like him!

3908
03:02:33,790 --> 03:02:34,430
What's this?

3909
03:02:34,830 --> 03:02:35,310
Hunter?

3910
03:02:35,530 --> 03:02:37,490
Is this a side quest?

3911
03:02:38,250 --> 03:02:38,730
Oh!

3912
03:02:39,130 --> 03:02:41,170
You earn rewards for taking out bad guys.

3913
03:02:41,170 --> 03:02:44,790
I don't see Hunt requests and reporting back once you completed them.

3914
03:02:45,170 --> 03:02:45,690
Okay.

3915
03:02:46,470 --> 03:02:47,730
I'm gonna accept that.

3916
03:02:48,450 --> 03:02:49,250
Diamonds, boss.

3917
03:02:49,890 --> 03:02:50,590
Oh, god.

3918
03:02:50,670 --> 03:02:52,910
It's those fetish freaks again.

3919
03:02:53,170 --> 03:02:54,670
It's the BDSM gear, guys.

3920
03:02:54,930 --> 03:02:56,010
And then Bandit.

3921
03:02:56,070 --> 03:02:56,570
Oh my god.

3922
03:02:56,630 --> 03:02:58,110
It's another tank to assimilate.

3923
03:02:58,650 --> 03:02:59,730
Oh my god!

3924
03:02:59,890 --> 03:03:00,770
Look at that!

3925
03:03:00,950 --> 03:03:03,590
It reminds me of the planes with the angry faces.

3926
03:03:04,730 --> 03:03:06,350
We're going to accept all of them.

3927
03:03:08,330 --> 03:03:08,850
Okay.

3928
03:03:09,810 --> 03:03:10,630
Oh wait, no!

3929
03:03:10,630 --> 03:03:11,690
No, I'm gonna accept all of them.

3930
03:03:12,370 --> 03:03:13,590
They're all gonna die.

3931
03:03:13,850 --> 03:03:15,730
I mean, pass out.

3932
03:03:16,330 --> 03:03:17,330
Tricky jumper.

3933
03:03:17,530 --> 03:03:18,470
Oh, is this a jumper?

3934
03:03:18,890 --> 03:03:21,010
Oh, that's what the jumper is gonna look like?

3935
03:03:21,270 --> 03:03:24,550
No, what if I wanna kill... I can't take anymore?

3936
03:03:26,090 --> 03:03:28,050
I wanna be a bounty hunter!

3937
03:03:29,730 --> 03:03:32,250
Bro, screw fucking finding water for people.

3938
03:03:40,530 --> 03:03:41,050
Woman.

3939
03:03:42,230 --> 03:03:44,510
What is that supposed to mean?

3940
03:03:45,430 --> 03:03:47,950
Hey, I'm the one you're supposed to be surprised by.

3941
03:03:49,970 --> 03:03:52,390
Apparently, junkers consider her to be a rarer.

3942
03:03:56,370 --> 03:03:59,350
So, uh, what are you looking for?

3943
03:03:59,790 --> 03:04:01,710
Could it be a date?

3944
03:04:01,750 --> 03:04:03,450
Oh, a female?

3945
03:04:04,930 --> 03:04:07,810
Do you know where we can find a core frame for a junk bot?

3946
03:04:08,810 --> 03:04:09,850
Oh, so...

3947
03:04:10,630 --> 03:04:11,570
You're here on business.

3948
03:04:13,150 --> 03:04:16,710
I mean, sure, I know where to find them, but...

3949
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:18,010
It'll cost you.

3950
03:04:18,470 --> 03:04:19,490
After all...

3951
03:04:19,490 --> 03:04:20,490
You gotta take a shot.

3952
03:04:20,670 --> 03:04:22,310
It's even rarer than demons, apparently.

3953
03:04:25,130 --> 03:04:25,630
Negotiate.

3954
03:04:25,890 --> 03:04:26,390
Negotiate.

3955
03:04:27,310 --> 03:04:28,030
Don't worry.

3956
03:04:28,350 --> 03:04:28,730
You're not free.

3957
03:04:28,910 --> 03:04:29,730
What do you want?

3958
03:04:30,090 --> 03:04:33,330
I have a woman here to negotiate for me.

3959
03:04:33,550 --> 03:04:34,530
Uh, what do you think?

3960
03:04:34,810 --> 03:04:35,310
Money?

3961
03:04:35,410 --> 03:04:35,850
Duh.

3962
03:04:37,870 --> 03:04:39,730
Sorry, but our funds are limited.

3963
03:04:40,630 --> 03:04:41,630
Can't you just tell us...

3964
03:04:41,630 --> 03:04:42,990
Yes, tell us what you want.

3965
03:04:45,770 --> 03:04:49,310
Maybe that generous young lady there could foot the bill.

3966
03:04:51,550 --> 03:04:53,850
I'm just as broke as the rest of you.

3967
03:04:55,890 --> 03:04:58,030
Just give him a... a small date.

3968
03:04:58,430 --> 03:05:00,770
There's another way to use the baby!

3969
03:05:00,990 --> 03:05:01,030
Whoa!

3970
03:05:01,330 --> 03:05:01,850
Whoa!

3971
03:05:04,710 --> 03:05:06,330
Hey, I'm a sheriff...

3972
03:05:06,330 --> 03:05:06,790
Whoa!

3973
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:09,170
I said that as a joke, bro!

3974
03:05:10,390 --> 03:05:10,910
Bro!

3975
03:05:12,570 --> 03:05:18,970
What the fuck?

3976
03:05:27,530 --> 03:05:28,930
What?

3977
03:05:36,830 --> 03:05:38,390
That's all he wants?

3978
03:05:42,570 --> 03:05:43,270
What the fuck?

3979
03:05:46,450 --> 03:05:47,570
Please, dragoons.

3980
03:06:06,730 --> 03:06:07,290
Sheep.

3981
03:06:07,290 --> 03:06:08,030
You're all sheep.

3982
03:06:10,510 --> 03:06:11,830
You're just like him.

3983
03:06:16,150 --> 03:06:16,590
Wait, wait, wait.

3984
03:06:22,030 --> 03:06:23,350
Fudge Shop, thank you for the super chat.

3985
03:06:23,410 --> 03:06:24,110
Thank you, thank you.

3986
03:06:24,130 --> 03:06:25,350
Hi, don't give us birthday today.

3987
03:06:25,590 --> 03:06:28,210
Haven't chosen a cake yet, so I'm asking you to pick a flavor.

3988
03:06:28,370 --> 03:06:31,450
The wilder, the better since I've had sushi cake last year.

3989
03:06:31,670 --> 03:06:33,030
Get green tea.

3990
03:06:33,170 --> 03:06:34,270
Green tea cake.

3991
03:06:34,490 --> 03:06:35,950
Also, happy birthday Fudge!

3992
03:06:35,950 --> 03:06:37,510
Happy birthday to you.

3993
03:06:37,670 --> 03:06:39,090
Happy birthday to you.

3994
03:06:39,190 --> 03:06:41,010
Happy birthday dear Fudge.

3995
03:06:41,010 --> 03:06:42,010
Happy birthday to you.

3996
03:06:42,050 --> 03:06:42,210
Yeah!

3997
03:06:42,570 --> 03:06:42,910
Or ice cream.

3998
03:06:42,990 --> 03:06:43,610
No, ice cream cake!

3999
03:06:43,750 --> 03:06:44,410
Get ice cream cake!

4000
03:06:44,650 --> 03:06:45,810
Ice cream cake is so much better!

4001
03:06:47,490 --> 03:06:47,930
Yowza!

4002
03:06:48,090 --> 03:06:49,850
That's what I'm talking about!

4003
03:06:50,690 --> 03:06:52,970
Not so deadpo- Thank you for the super chat.

4004
03:06:53,070 --> 03:06:53,890
Thank you, thank you.

4005
03:06:54,530 --> 03:06:54,970
Yup.

4006
03:06:55,310 --> 03:06:56,410
I can't believe it.

4007
03:06:56,450 --> 03:06:57,530
He's in my chat too.

4008
03:06:57,790 --> 03:06:58,610
Oh my god.

4009
03:06:59,130 --> 03:07:00,010
Can we get a jump bot for ourselves?

4010
03:07:00,310 --> 03:07:01,230
If we clobber them?

4011
03:07:02,870 --> 03:07:04,810
If you clobber them, then fine.

4012
03:07:05,050 --> 03:07:05,410
Sure.

4013
03:07:07,250 --> 03:07:09,290
Don't thank you for the super chat.

4014
03:07:09,370 --> 03:07:10,430
Thank you, thank you.

4015
03:07:10,490 --> 03:07:12,410
Not even a true simp.

4016
03:07:12,570 --> 03:07:13,790
Didn't ask for feedback.

4017
03:07:13,790 --> 03:07:14,830
You should sound confident.

4018
03:07:17,450 --> 03:07:21,010
The entrance to the ship is through the cave up ahead.

4019
03:07:21,310 --> 03:07:21,670
Okay.

4020
03:07:21,830 --> 03:07:22,690
We gotta go through there.

4021
03:07:23,350 --> 03:07:27,210
I imagine that bouncing schmucks already made it pretty far inside.

4022
03:07:27,370 --> 03:07:28,290
Go get him.

4023
03:07:28,470 --> 03:07:29,030
What?

4024
03:07:29,710 --> 03:07:30,790
By the way, miss.

4025
03:07:30,950 --> 03:07:33,290
Could you say that again just one more time?

4026
03:07:33,530 --> 03:07:34,470
Oh my god.

4027
03:07:34,530 --> 03:07:35,430
He's hooked, guys.

4028
03:07:35,710 --> 03:07:36,590
He's hooked.

4029
03:07:36,890 --> 03:07:37,270
Afraid not.

4030
03:07:37,430 --> 03:07:39,170
That was a limited time offer.

4031
03:07:39,410 --> 03:07:41,470
He's gonna tier 10 sub to her.

4032
03:07:41,590 --> 03:07:41,830
He's gonna tier 10 sub to her.

4033
03:07:44,790 --> 03:07:45,830
Oh my god.

4034
03:07:45,910 --> 03:07:46,530
It's too late.

4035
03:07:46,930 --> 03:07:47,710
It's too late.

4036
03:07:47,790 --> 03:07:49,710
He's gonna find out what's her YouTube account.

4037
03:07:53,940 --> 03:07:56,180
She's gonna be his Oshi forever now.

4038
03:07:58,300 --> 03:07:58,780
Alright.

4039
03:07:58,820 --> 03:07:59,620
Well, okay.

4040
03:07:59,720 --> 03:08:00,420
How far is this?

4041
03:08:00,520 --> 03:08:00,720
Okay.

4042
03:08:00,780 --> 03:08:01,160
190.

4043
03:08:01,680 --> 03:08:02,160
Okay.

4044
03:08:02,240 --> 03:08:03,360
I'm gonna grab this.

4045
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:04,620
Grab these items.

4046
03:08:04,740 --> 03:08:07,720
And then we'll go back and steal that dinosaur.

4047
03:08:08,060 --> 03:08:08,880
I'm gonna GTD it.

4048
03:08:09,620 --> 03:08:10,100
Okay.

4049
03:08:10,220 --> 03:08:10,980
Grab this.

4050
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:12,880
And then...

4051
03:08:12,880 --> 03:08:13,200
Alright.

4052
03:08:13,240 --> 03:08:14,180
I'm full HP now.

4053
03:08:14,320 --> 03:08:15,760
Does that heal my tank as well?

4054
03:08:16,420 --> 03:08:18,220
Does drinking water heal my tank?

4055
03:08:18,440 --> 03:08:19,100
Can I select...

4056
03:08:19,100 --> 03:08:19,680
Oh my gosh.

4057
03:08:20,240 --> 03:08:20,680
Okay.

4058
03:08:21,620 --> 03:08:22,460
I'm going back.

4059
03:08:23,220 --> 03:08:24,640
It's time to GTD it.

4060
03:08:26,940 --> 03:08:28,080
Thank you for the super chat.

4061
03:08:28,180 --> 03:08:28,460
Thank you.

4062
03:08:28,480 --> 03:08:28,940
Thank you.

4063
03:08:28,960 --> 03:08:29,160
Damn.

4064
03:08:29,240 --> 03:08:30,980
This just got me thinking about how people...

4065
03:08:33,280 --> 03:08:35,400
About people donate for a...

4066
03:08:35,400 --> 03:08:36,140
Yeah.

4067
03:08:36,200 --> 03:08:36,800
That line.

4068
03:08:37,540 --> 03:08:38,620
That line, right?

4069
03:08:40,060 --> 03:08:40,960
You know the deal.

4070
03:08:40,980 --> 03:08:41,520
The deal clock.

4071
03:08:41,860 --> 03:08:43,560
Thank you for the super chat.

4072
03:08:43,660 --> 03:08:44,100
Thank you.

4073
03:08:44,120 --> 03:08:44,860
Thank you.

4074
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:47,340
JP, thank you for the super chat.

4075
03:08:47,400 --> 03:08:47,640
Thank you.

4076
03:08:47,660 --> 03:08:48,100
Thank you.

4077
03:08:48,260 --> 03:08:50,240
He's gonna find her only tanks.

4078
03:08:51,480 --> 03:08:51,960
No!

4079
03:08:53,060 --> 03:08:54,320
I can't GT.

4080
03:08:54,620 --> 03:08:55,720
Bro, what the fuck?

4081
03:08:55,740 --> 03:08:56,400
No dino...

4082
03:08:56,400 --> 03:08:56,900
No!

4083
03:08:57,020 --> 03:08:58,360
And then he ran off!

4084
03:09:01,640 --> 03:09:02,820
No dinos allowed.

4085
03:09:03,560 --> 03:09:04,040
Sir!

4086
03:09:04,340 --> 03:09:06,200
This is Dino-sist!

4087
03:09:07,180 --> 03:09:08,540
Me, thank you for the...

4088
03:09:08,540 --> 03:09:09,020
Thank you.

4089
03:09:09,380 --> 03:09:09,860
Thank you.

4090
03:09:09,860 --> 03:09:10,460
Thank you.

4091
03:09:12,600 --> 03:09:13,200
Thank you.

4092
03:09:13,200 --> 03:09:14,280
I can't believe it.

4093
03:09:16,120 --> 03:09:17,560
They hate dinosaurs!

4094
03:09:20,280 --> 03:09:21,200
It's time.

4095
03:09:21,200 --> 03:09:22,580
It's time to get rid of a...

4096
03:09:22,580 --> 03:09:23,720
Get rid of a village.

4097
03:09:28,920 --> 03:09:30,420
Oh my god.

4098
03:09:30,460 --> 03:09:31,520
He's the chosen one.

4099
03:09:31,520 --> 03:09:32,400
Is that so?

4100
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:34,440
Just you wait.

4101
03:09:34,580 --> 03:09:37,120
I'm gonna be the biggest, baddest demon ever.

4102
03:09:39,000 --> 03:09:39,540
Let's see.

4103
03:09:41,040 --> 03:09:41,880
Oh, they're fine.

4104
03:09:41,960 --> 03:09:42,800
They're fine, guys.

4105
03:09:43,220 --> 03:09:44,100
Battle ship cape.

4106
03:09:44,180 --> 03:09:44,700
Wait, what's this?

4107
03:09:45,140 --> 03:09:45,820
Oh, it's loot.

4108
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:46,960
Can I like, loot it from here?

4109
03:09:47,300 --> 03:09:47,880
Oh, I can.

4110
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:48,380
Nice.

4111
03:09:48,520 --> 03:09:49,020
Okay, nice.

4112
03:09:49,060 --> 03:09:50,560
I don't have to get off my tank.

4113
03:09:50,880 --> 03:09:52,540
Thank you for the 10 gifted ships!

4114
03:09:52,740 --> 03:09:53,040
Thank you!

4115
03:09:53,080 --> 03:09:53,660
Thank you!

4116
03:09:54,080 --> 03:09:55,320
I really appreciate it.

4117
03:09:55,360 --> 03:09:56,000
Thank you so much.

4118
03:09:57,560 --> 03:09:57,920
Okay.

4119
03:09:59,100 --> 03:10:00,400
It's not a crime.

4120
03:10:00,660 --> 03:10:01,940
If they deserve it.

4121
03:10:04,580 --> 03:10:05,100
They...

4122
03:10:05,100 --> 03:10:08,760
They scared my... They wouldn't let me have my dinos!

4123
03:10:09,100 --> 03:10:09,960
This cave is huge!

4124
03:10:11,200 --> 03:10:14,620
Looks like this cave leads straight to the Lysa battleship.

4125
03:10:15,140 --> 03:10:15,660
Looks like this cave leads straight to the Lysa battleship.

4126
03:10:15,660 --> 03:10:16,420
Wait, is that the part?

4127
03:10:16,560 --> 03:10:21,140
It seems that the Junkers have cobbled together a convenient route between the market and battleship.

4128
03:10:21,200 --> 03:10:21,780
Oh, here it is.

4129
03:10:22,160 --> 03:10:23,040
There it is.

4130
03:10:23,440 --> 03:10:24,700
But how do I...

4131
03:10:25,840 --> 03:10:27,520
No dino for you.

4132
03:10:27,580 --> 03:10:27,900
That's not...

4133
03:10:27,920 --> 03:10:28,620
That's so fucked up.

4134
03:10:28,960 --> 03:10:30,460
Oh, I have to jump.

4135
03:10:30,520 --> 03:10:31,360
I have to parkour.

4136
03:10:32,460 --> 03:10:33,760
Guys, I found the yellow.

4137
03:10:36,040 --> 03:10:37,920
I found the fucking yellow.

4138
03:10:39,700 --> 03:10:41,120
It's always the yellow.

4139
03:10:42,660 --> 03:10:43,640
Alright, this way.

4140
03:10:44,740 --> 03:10:45,560
This way.

4141
03:10:45,780 --> 03:10:47,460
I like how like, the sound is...

4142
03:10:47,460 --> 03:10:48,880
I like the sound design for this game.

4143
03:10:49,120 --> 03:10:51,400
Like, even in the caves, you can tell like...

4144
03:10:51,840 --> 03:10:53,360
We're in the caves with the immersion.

4145
03:10:57,920 --> 03:11:00,500
Find all sorts of treasure hidden around the world.

4146
03:11:00,600 --> 03:11:01,800
Use these skills.

4147
03:11:01,960 --> 03:11:04,540
Thief Raider to make locating treasure easier.

4148
03:11:05,320 --> 03:11:05,840
But...

4149
03:11:05,840 --> 03:11:06,760
I don't...

4150
03:11:07,800 --> 03:11:08,320
Thief?

4151
03:11:08,320 --> 03:11:08,840
Treasure?

4152
03:11:13,460 --> 03:11:14,680
Spood Booster Chip.

4153
03:11:14,780 --> 03:11:16,480
Oh, I found like a booster chip.

4154
03:11:16,800 --> 03:11:17,580
Oh, that's nice.

4155
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:20,620
Roku, thank you for the gift of chips.

4156
03:11:20,620 --> 03:11:20,820
Thank you.

4157
03:11:22,240 --> 03:11:24,200
The yellow paint cave.

4158
03:11:24,200 --> 03:11:25,740
My favorite.

4159
03:11:26,780 --> 03:11:28,400
My favorite type of cave.

4160
03:11:30,380 --> 03:11:31,540
I don't need ladders.

4161
03:11:31,580 --> 03:11:32,420
I can parkour.

4162
03:11:33,440 --> 03:11:34,820
Wait, which way do I go?

4163
03:11:35,020 --> 03:11:36,060
Oh, this has to be...

4164
03:11:36,060 --> 03:11:37,020
Okay, this is the lore.

4165
03:11:37,580 --> 03:11:39,620
So, maybe there's loot here?

4166
03:11:40,740 --> 03:11:41,740
I knew it.

4167
03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:43,800
I knew it.

4168
03:11:44,100 --> 03:11:45,740
I'm a real gamer, guys.

4169
03:11:47,300 --> 03:11:48,880
Welcome to level design.

4170
03:11:54,380 --> 03:11:55,120
Here we go.

4171
03:11:56,960 --> 03:11:57,320
Alright.

4172
03:11:57,320 --> 03:11:58,060
Here we go.

4173
03:11:59,120 --> 03:12:00,000
Here we go.

4174
03:12:01,660 --> 03:12:02,180
Let's see.

4175
03:12:02,620 --> 03:12:02,980
Loot.

4176
03:12:03,880 --> 03:12:04,240
Yay!

4177
03:12:06,460 --> 03:12:06,820
Alright.

4178
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:08,760
Looks like we can head inside.

4179
03:12:09,620 --> 03:12:10,320
Let me in.

4180
03:12:15,000 --> 03:12:15,920
Let me in.

4181
03:12:15,980 --> 03:12:16,840
Okay, he didn't stop me.

4182
03:12:16,900 --> 03:12:18,540
Okay, I was gonna say, let me in right now.

4183
03:12:18,580 --> 03:12:19,140
And he's like, okay.

4184
03:12:21,220 --> 03:12:22,520
He's like, it was never locked.

4185
03:12:22,700 --> 03:12:24,080
Doki, it was never locked.

4186
03:12:24,100 --> 03:12:24,860
You go right in.

4187
03:12:25,200 --> 03:12:25,700
Go right in.

4188
03:12:29,140 --> 03:12:29,660
Oh!

4189
03:12:37,640 --> 03:12:38,160
Oh!

4190
03:12:39,860 --> 03:12:39,900
Oh!

4191
03:12:40,440 --> 03:12:40,980
Okay, that's pretty.

4192
03:12:43,940 --> 03:12:45,060
It's so beautiful.

4193
03:12:45,060 --> 03:12:46,320
Let me send a tank in.

4194
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:51,780
It's so beautiful.

4195
03:12:51,800 --> 03:12:53,820
Time to destroy it all with a tank.

4196
03:12:54,240 --> 03:12:54,720
It's so beautiful.

4197
03:12:54,720 --> 03:12:54,720
Time to destroy it all with a tank.

4198
03:12:54,720 --> 03:12:54,740
Oh!

4199
03:12:55,080 --> 03:12:56,720
Even the music's nice, though.

4200
03:12:57,460 --> 03:12:57,980
Oh!

4201
03:12:57,980 --> 03:12:57,980
Even the music's nice, though.

4202
03:12:59,580 --> 03:13:00,100
Oh!

4203
03:13:05,470 --> 03:13:05,990
Oh!

4204
03:13:06,010 --> 03:13:07,430
Oh, I love the BGM for this.

4205
03:13:09,090 --> 03:13:09,610
Oh, I love the BGM for this.

4206
03:13:09,610 --> 03:13:11,630
Looks like we've hit a dead end.

4207
03:13:12,270 --> 03:13:15,630
Oh, there has to be a boss fight in the sand.

4208
03:13:15,850 --> 03:13:17,630
Blast from the main cannon should blow it all away.

4209
03:13:18,950 --> 03:13:19,470
Nice.

4210
03:13:21,630 --> 03:13:23,030
We're gonna destroy...

4211
03:13:23,030 --> 03:13:24,250
We're gonna destroy...

4212
03:13:24,890 --> 03:13:25,790
a world wonder.

4213
03:13:29,010 --> 03:13:30,270
Yeah, I'm inside the ship.

4214
03:13:33,170 --> 03:13:33,710
Oh!

4215
03:13:33,830 --> 03:13:34,370
Oh!

4216
03:13:34,970 --> 03:13:35,770
What's this?

4217
03:13:36,330 --> 03:13:37,830
Yes, that's the way.

4218
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:40,210
No!

4219
03:13:40,430 --> 03:13:41,190
He's too thick!

4220
03:13:41,430 --> 03:13:43,030
Guys, close the door!

4221
03:13:45,930 --> 03:13:49,330
Guys, I need you guys to close the door!

4222
03:13:50,610 --> 03:13:52,210
Guys, I need you guys to close the door!

4223
03:13:52,210 --> 03:13:52,350
Guys, I need you guys to close the door!

4224
03:13:52,350 --> 03:13:54,030
Guys, I need you guys to close the door!

4225
03:13:54,030 --> 03:13:55,110
Bro, I don't know, guys.

4226
03:13:55,230 --> 03:13:55,750
I think...

4227
03:13:55,750 --> 03:13:58,470
I think my allies are a bit stupid.

4228
03:13:58,470 --> 03:14:00,890
Okay, what if I do this and I turn around?

4229
03:14:01,190 --> 03:14:02,230
And it's magic!

4230
03:14:02,750 --> 03:14:03,890
It's a magic trick.

4231
03:14:05,370 --> 03:14:07,050
Guys, you guys like my magic trick?

4232
03:14:08,630 --> 03:14:10,190
The door is stuck.

4233
03:14:10,350 --> 03:14:13,130
Literally all they had to do was just close the door.

4234
03:14:13,510 --> 03:14:14,430
That's all they...

4235
03:14:14,430 --> 03:14:15,090
Wait, can I...

4236
03:14:15,090 --> 03:14:17,150
Oh, they have invisible walls for a reason.

4237
03:14:17,210 --> 03:14:18,130
They Doki-proofed it.

4238
03:14:22,070 --> 03:14:23,830
They did not Doki-proof it.

4239
03:14:24,310 --> 03:14:24,790
Hahaha!

4240
03:14:31,030 --> 03:14:31,630
Alright.

4241
03:14:36,570 --> 03:14:37,470
We got...

4242
03:14:38,830 --> 03:14:40,450
more B-grade stuff.

4243
03:14:41,170 --> 03:14:42,650
I assume like...

4244
03:14:42,650 --> 03:14:45,090
Okay, there must be loot around here.

4245
03:14:45,210 --> 03:14:45,510
Right?

4246
03:14:46,570 --> 03:14:48,370
Because we have to go to the top.

4247
03:14:48,570 --> 03:14:50,570
So there must be hidden loot right here.

4248
03:14:52,150 --> 03:14:54,030
Judging by my gamer skills.

4249
03:14:54,210 --> 03:14:54,770
Judging by my gamer skills.

4250
03:14:54,790 --> 03:14:55,650
There must... Okay.

4251
03:14:56,070 --> 03:14:57,530
Just not here apparently.

4252
03:14:58,190 --> 03:14:59,510
I guess not here.

4253
03:15:02,090 --> 03:15:02,590
Alright.

4254
03:15:03,690 --> 03:15:04,190
Yellow!

4255
03:15:06,470 --> 03:15:07,910
Thank god for the yellow.

4256
03:15:10,450 --> 03:15:11,850
So I make sure...

4257
03:15:11,850 --> 03:15:15,290
I mean, there has to be loot arou- Oh fuck, okay.

4258
03:15:15,490 --> 03:15:16,270
What the fuck?

4259
03:15:16,390 --> 03:15:17,450
Did I actually use my double jump?

4260
03:15:19,530 --> 03:15:21,770
There should be loot right here, right?

4261
03:15:23,310 --> 03:15:24,770
There should be loot right here, right?

4262
03:15:24,770 --> 03:15:26,190
Cause like look, there's this.

4263
03:15:27,390 --> 03:15:28,990
If I jump on this platform...

4264
03:15:29,390 --> 03:15:31,110
and then here...

4265
03:15:31,110 --> 03:15:31,250
No!

4266
03:15:31,330 --> 03:15:31,770
What?

4267
03:15:33,630 --> 03:15:34,770
What the fuck?

4268
03:15:36,110 --> 03:15:36,950
Guys, you just...

4269
03:15:36,950 --> 03:15:38,590
guys watched me jump like that?

4270
03:15:38,790 --> 03:15:39,530
You're not gonna help out?

4271
03:15:41,090 --> 03:15:42,130
Surely, right?

4272
03:15:43,130 --> 03:15:43,850
Like, huh?

4273
03:15:45,530 --> 03:15:46,730
Oh, there's like...

4274
03:15:46,730 --> 03:15:47,030
What?

4275
03:15:47,470 --> 03:15:49,050
I can't stand on the pipes?

4276
03:15:49,850 --> 03:15:50,750
But what?

4277
03:15:51,070 --> 03:15:51,590
Hahaha!

4278
03:15:53,330 --> 03:15:54,570
That's fucked up, yo.

4279
03:15:55,330 --> 03:15:57,870
They wouldn't let me stand on the pipes, guys.

4280
03:15:58,450 --> 03:15:59,250
No floor.

4281
03:16:01,910 --> 03:16:02,790
Okay, this way.

4282
03:16:03,430 --> 03:16:04,910
What the heck happened here?

4283
03:16:05,190 --> 03:16:06,590
The place is a mess.

4284
03:16:07,970 --> 03:16:08,450
Hahaha!

4285
03:16:08,450 --> 03:16:09,770
Trying for the scale would do that.

4286
03:16:10,370 --> 03:16:12,170
Try to watch your footing.

4287
03:16:12,570 --> 03:16:14,490
Thank you for the Akka Supa.

4288
03:16:14,530 --> 03:16:15,570
Thank you, thank you.

4289
03:16:15,690 --> 03:16:17,230
Shit, I just got paid anyway.

4290
03:16:17,250 --> 03:16:18,310
Can I get it?

4291
03:16:18,810 --> 03:16:20,610
You're my little pogchamp.

4292
03:16:20,770 --> 03:16:21,290
Come here.

4293
03:16:21,590 --> 03:16:21,750
Hahaha!

4294
03:16:23,230 --> 03:16:25,410
Thank you for the Akka Supa.

4295
03:16:25,490 --> 03:16:26,690
Thank you, thank you.

4296
03:16:26,930 --> 03:16:27,430
Wow!

4297
03:16:29,010 --> 03:16:29,530
Wow!

4298
03:16:30,210 --> 03:16:31,090
I keep falling!

4299
03:16:31,470 --> 03:16:33,370
That's why I told you to watch your...

4300
03:16:33,370 --> 03:16:33,990
Wait.

4301
03:16:34,810 --> 03:16:35,570
Someone's coming.

4302
03:16:35,890 --> 03:16:36,410
What?

4303
03:16:36,470 --> 03:16:37,370
Who is it?

4304
03:16:37,530 --> 03:16:38,490
Oh, there it is.

4305
03:16:38,490 --> 03:16:39,030
There's the...

4306
03:16:39,430 --> 03:16:39,990
pause button.

4307
03:16:46,880 --> 03:16:47,400
Alright.

4308
03:16:47,740 --> 03:16:49,040
It's time to grab the tank.

4309
03:16:49,840 --> 03:16:50,680
Give me a sec.

4310
03:16:51,060 --> 03:16:52,320
Pause, pause, guys!

4311
03:16:52,480 --> 03:16:52,960
Pause!

4312
03:16:53,240 --> 03:16:53,560
Hahaha!

4313
03:16:56,100 --> 03:16:56,920
There you go.

4314
03:16:57,020 --> 03:16:58,760
Thank you for all grouping up together.

4315
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:00,020
Nice.

4316
03:17:00,080 --> 03:17:00,580
Reloading?

4317
03:17:00,920 --> 03:17:01,660
Is that it?

4318
03:17:02,440 --> 03:17:03,300
Oh, that was easy.

4319
03:17:05,900 --> 03:17:06,960
Oh my god!

4320
03:17:06,960 --> 03:17:07,580
He said bot!

4321
03:17:07,740 --> 03:17:09,160
Sorry, I thought...

4322
03:17:09,160 --> 03:17:09,480
Hahaha!

4323
03:17:12,720 --> 03:17:14,520
Bro, that sounded like dumb fuck.

4324
03:17:14,720 --> 03:17:15,180
I was like...

4325
03:17:15,180 --> 03:17:15,700
Hahaha!

4326
03:17:15,780 --> 03:17:16,280
Hahaha!

4327
03:17:16,600 --> 03:17:16,960
Hahaha!

4328
03:17:18,100 --> 03:17:18,600
Hahaha!

4329
03:17:25,280 --> 03:17:26,460
I was like...

4330
03:17:26,460 --> 03:17:29,540
Did not sound like that!

4331
03:17:29,760 --> 03:17:30,240
I was like...

4332
03:17:30,240 --> 03:17:30,920
Oh my god!

4333
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:33,300
He is a demon!

4334
03:17:39,010 --> 03:17:40,090
We gotta go this way.

4335
03:17:41,790 --> 03:17:42,230
Alright.

4336
03:17:42,290 --> 03:17:42,730
Nice.

4337
03:17:43,010 --> 03:17:44,410
We got a battleship.

4338
03:17:44,970 --> 03:17:45,850
One obtained.

4339
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:47,310
Oh, we got a map of this.

4340
03:17:47,670 --> 03:17:49,470
I thought I already had the map of it.

4341
03:17:49,970 --> 03:17:51,490
I guess we have a map of it here.

4342
03:17:51,490 --> 03:17:51,870
Here?

4343
03:17:53,750 --> 03:17:54,190
Here?

4344
03:17:55,250 --> 03:17:55,790
Is that me?

4345
03:17:56,250 --> 03:17:56,690
Alright.

4346
03:18:00,330 --> 03:18:01,230
I'm gonna beat you up.

4347
03:18:03,130 --> 03:18:04,090
That's fucking right.

4348
03:18:04,290 --> 03:18:05,690
I'm gonna beat you up with my fists!

4349
03:18:06,050 --> 03:18:06,910
Oh, I doubled up!

4350
03:18:07,850 --> 03:18:08,290
Yeah!

4351
03:18:10,810 --> 03:18:11,250
Alright.

4352
03:18:11,650 --> 03:18:12,610
Performing leg sweep.

4353
03:18:15,310 --> 03:18:17,450
Allows you to evade mid jump.

4354
03:18:18,110 --> 03:18:19,010
Focuses your energy.

4355
03:18:19,050 --> 03:18:20,150
Releasing will let you...

4356
03:18:20,150 --> 03:18:20,990
Okay, I think I'm gonna...

4357
03:18:21,490 --> 03:18:22,670
I'm gonna do an air combo.

4358
03:18:24,590 --> 03:18:25,230
Let's see.

4359
03:18:25,850 --> 03:18:28,170
The rare moments I get to fight.

4360
03:18:28,290 --> 03:18:29,430
I feel like...

4361
03:18:30,150 --> 03:18:31,290
We'll do air combo.

4362
03:18:31,630 --> 03:18:33,050
I feel like air combo will be better.

4363
03:18:33,390 --> 03:18:33,730
Alright.

4364
03:18:33,870 --> 03:18:35,270
And then...

4365
03:18:35,270 --> 03:18:36,010
Let's see.

4366
03:18:37,330 --> 03:18:38,170
Poison gas.

4367
03:18:39,870 --> 03:18:40,810
Item picker.

4368
03:18:40,890 --> 03:18:42,810
Destroy nearby rocks and collect all available.

4369
03:18:42,950 --> 03:18:44,690
The enemy has gifted a bomb.

4370
03:18:44,930 --> 03:18:45,390
Oh, okay.

4371
03:18:45,490 --> 03:18:47,110
You're gonna start collecting stuff.

4372
03:18:47,450 --> 03:18:48,110
That's good.

4373
03:18:48,990 --> 03:18:52,170
That's actually more helpful than whatever the fuck the sheriff is doing.

4374
03:18:54,150 --> 03:18:55,110
Where are...

4375
03:18:57,790 --> 03:18:58,530
Hey, guys.

4376
03:18:58,610 --> 03:19:01,490
I have a feeling one of them is more helpful than the other.

4377
03:19:06,950 --> 03:19:07,990
I have a feeling one of them is more helpful than the other.

4378
03:19:07,990 --> 03:19:09,970
I knew the interior was so huge!

4379
03:19:12,850 --> 03:19:14,090
Case in point.

4380
03:19:14,090 --> 03:19:16,210
Case in point.

4381
03:19:19,630 --> 03:19:20,630
We can jump.

4382
03:19:23,150 --> 03:19:24,450
Oh, there's items here.

4383
03:19:29,690 --> 03:19:31,570
We got one of the steers.

4384
03:19:34,470 --> 03:19:36,810
Oh my god, there were stairs this whole time?

4385
03:19:40,330 --> 03:19:40,810
Sorry.

4386
03:19:40,810 --> 03:19:42,090
That was a close call.

4387
03:19:43,990 --> 03:19:45,250
Oh hey, there's a dead guy.

4388
03:19:48,110 --> 03:19:48,650
Red dude?

4389
03:19:48,930 --> 03:19:50,410
Who the fuck is the red dude?

4390
03:19:51,050 --> 03:19:53,610
Is it the... the...

4391
03:19:54,670 --> 03:19:55,970
Oh wait, what the fuck?

4392
03:19:58,630 --> 03:19:59,930
It's the Royal Army?

4393
03:20:02,650 --> 03:20:04,590
Guys, the girl doesn't need upgrades.

4394
03:20:04,830 --> 03:20:05,690
She's already perfect.

4395
03:20:06,410 --> 03:20:08,530
She's just there to upgrade my tank.

4396
03:20:14,550 --> 03:20:15,470
It's mine.

4397
03:20:16,390 --> 03:20:17,710
Doki, he's old!

4398
03:20:17,950 --> 03:20:19,430
Give him some slack!

4399
03:20:21,690 --> 03:20:22,530
Tank time.

4400
03:20:23,490 --> 03:20:24,210
Tank time!

4401
03:20:25,430 --> 03:20:25,910
Boom.

4402
03:20:27,050 --> 03:20:27,530
Boom!

4403
03:20:29,470 --> 03:20:30,810
Guys, is this overkill?

4404
03:20:31,350 --> 03:20:31,830
No.

4405
03:20:32,090 --> 03:20:33,270
Nothing has ever...

4406
03:20:33,270 --> 03:20:34,370
What is this gonna do?

4407
03:20:34,390 --> 03:20:34,810
Explode?

4408
03:20:35,110 --> 03:20:36,410
Oh shit!

4409
03:20:39,770 --> 03:20:40,250
Guys...

4410
03:20:41,610 --> 03:20:43,510
I think it exploded, guys.

4411
03:20:45,130 --> 03:20:46,350
Oh wait, there's stuff here.

4412
03:20:49,590 --> 03:20:50,750
Guys, wanna see my trick?

4413
03:20:50,930 --> 03:20:51,290
Watch this.

4414
03:20:53,570 --> 03:20:54,090
Abracadabra.

4415
03:20:54,770 --> 03:20:55,990
Oh, sorry, sorry.

4416
03:20:56,710 --> 03:20:57,830
Guys, watch this.

4417
03:20:59,630 --> 03:21:00,150
Abracadabra.

4418
03:21:02,630 --> 03:21:06,270
Pretty sure I could get over that with a hijack.

4419
03:21:08,330 --> 03:21:09,550
Sorry, there was a delay.

4420
03:21:10,710 --> 03:21:11,470
Guys, sorry.

4421
03:21:11,530 --> 03:21:13,150
My magic trick was lagging, guys.

4422
03:21:15,630 --> 03:21:17,590
Guys, it's understandable, okay?

4423
03:21:17,670 --> 03:21:19,570
My magic trick was lagging, okay?

4424
03:21:20,070 --> 03:21:25,950
There's like... I'm on a... I'm on an East Coast server at the moment, so it lagged a little.

4425
03:21:29,730 --> 03:21:30,310
What's this?

4426
03:21:30,610 --> 03:21:31,050
Open.

4427
03:21:31,370 --> 03:21:32,090
Open sesame.

4428
03:21:32,430 --> 03:21:33,710
Oh, I definitely need the tank.

4429
03:21:35,730 --> 03:21:37,230
They're not locked in here.

4430
03:21:37,350 --> 03:21:38,590
I'm not locked in here with them.

4431
03:21:39,550 --> 03:21:41,750
I'm locked... They're locked in here with me.

4432
03:21:43,030 --> 03:21:43,650
Say less.

4433
03:21:45,150 --> 03:21:46,450
Oh hey, they can jump too.

4434
03:21:47,070 --> 03:21:47,890
What the fuck?

4435
03:21:47,890 --> 03:21:48,610
Am I not special?

4436
03:21:51,550 --> 03:21:53,010
The door is unlocked!

4437
03:21:53,470 --> 03:21:53,770
Yeah!

4438
03:21:54,750 --> 03:21:56,250
No one keeps Biel's prisoner.

4439
03:21:56,430 --> 03:21:56,990
On we go!

4440
03:21:57,310 --> 03:21:57,870
Which way?

4441
03:21:58,070 --> 03:21:58,590
This way?

4442
03:21:58,790 --> 03:22:00,170
You might get locked inside again.

4443
03:22:00,530 --> 03:22:01,310
Stay alert.

4444
03:22:03,870 --> 03:22:04,270
Yeah!

4445
03:22:05,890 --> 03:22:06,530
Where do I go?

4446
03:22:06,990 --> 03:22:07,390
What's this?

4447
03:22:07,590 --> 03:22:08,290
Yeah, what's this?

4448
03:22:08,690 --> 03:22:10,750
That switch probably controls this elevator.

4449
03:22:11,330 --> 03:22:11,730
Where?

4450
03:22:11,970 --> 03:22:12,990
Try turning it on.

4451
03:22:13,590 --> 03:22:14,230
Wait, where?

4452
03:22:14,950 --> 03:22:15,590
Oh, here.

4453
03:22:15,650 --> 03:22:16,710
Can I turn it on in my tank?

4454
03:22:17,150 --> 03:22:19,070
No, I have to get off the tank.

4455
03:22:19,190 --> 03:22:21,050
Oh my god, I thought I was gonna get off the railing.

4456
03:22:22,010 --> 03:22:22,690
What?

4457
03:22:22,810 --> 03:22:23,050
No.

4458
03:22:24,070 --> 03:22:25,270
Where's the switch?

4459
03:22:25,710 --> 03:22:26,990
Oh my god.

4460
03:22:29,990 --> 03:22:30,670
What?

4461
03:22:32,950 --> 03:22:33,870
Bro, get up there.

4462
03:22:36,850 --> 03:22:37,790
Excuse me?

4463
03:22:41,070 --> 03:22:41,750
Goodbye.

4464
03:22:44,510 --> 03:22:45,190
Hello?

4465
03:22:49,690 --> 03:22:50,690
Excuse me?

4466
03:22:52,270 --> 03:22:52,950
Hello?

4467
03:22:53,750 --> 03:22:53,990
Wow...

4468
03:22:56,510 --> 03:22:57,730
It's up here?

4469
03:22:58,990 --> 03:23:00,070
Is this...

4470
03:23:02,810 --> 03:23:09,070
How the fuck... OK Guys, the elevator was the floor all along guys.

4471
03:23:09,350 --> 03:23:12,050
Guys, the elevator was the floor.

4472
03:23:13,690 --> 03:23:16,070
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

4473
03:23:18,470 --> 03:23:21,510
There was a switch next to the elevator!

4474
03:23:22,010 --> 03:23:22,690
What?

4475
03:23:27,050 --> 03:23:28,130
Alright, here we go.

4476
03:23:30,790 --> 03:23:31,590
Wrong one.

4477
03:23:31,970 --> 03:23:32,610
There we go.

4478
03:23:33,350 --> 03:23:34,750
Is there another fight here?

4479
03:23:35,590 --> 03:23:35,990
No.

4480
03:23:36,810 --> 03:23:37,930
I just have to go forward.

4481
03:23:38,810 --> 03:23:40,550
I like how the...

4482
03:23:41,050 --> 03:23:41,450
No!

4483
03:23:41,670 --> 03:23:42,570
No, no, no, no, no, no!

4484
03:23:42,730 --> 03:23:43,490
Okay, there we go.

4485
03:23:43,490 --> 03:23:43,810
We're fine.

4486
03:23:44,690 --> 03:23:45,290
We're fine.

4487
03:23:45,310 --> 03:23:46,110
This is not overkill.

4488
03:23:48,110 --> 03:23:50,090
Let's reload this real fast too.

4489
03:23:54,710 --> 03:23:55,230
Awww.

4490
03:24:02,590 --> 03:24:03,470
Where's the arm?

4491
03:24:03,670 --> 03:24:04,750
Oh, this is the arm.

4492
03:24:06,010 --> 03:24:06,530
Boom.

4493
03:24:07,770 --> 03:24:08,990
Alright, we gotta get off.

4494
03:24:09,890 --> 03:24:10,410
Here.

4495
03:24:10,410 --> 03:24:11,750
Alright, up we go!

4496
03:24:12,090 --> 03:24:12,610
Here we go!

4497
03:24:15,230 --> 03:24:16,690
And up here.

4498
03:24:17,290 --> 03:24:18,230
Up here.

4499
03:24:18,790 --> 03:24:19,310
Yeah!

4500
03:24:21,230 --> 03:24:22,250
Wait, there's a yellow.

4501
03:24:23,150 --> 03:24:24,350
Guys, there's a yellow door.

4502
03:24:24,570 --> 03:24:25,770
And we know what that means.

4503
03:24:27,110 --> 03:24:28,510
Thank God for all the yellow.

4504
03:24:33,530 --> 03:24:34,850
There's another yellow door.

4505
03:24:35,970 --> 03:24:37,090
There's a secret here.

4506
03:24:39,490 --> 03:24:40,310
There's a secret!

4507
03:24:42,090 --> 03:24:43,050
Have I been here?

4508
03:24:43,190 --> 03:24:44,630
Oh my God, there's a secret!

4509
03:24:44,730 --> 03:24:45,870
Look at all the yellow doors!

4510
03:24:47,990 --> 03:24:50,070
Not a good place to call it.

4511
03:24:50,210 --> 03:24:50,790
Okay, don't worry.

4512
03:24:51,730 --> 03:24:52,170
Woo!

4513
03:24:54,030 --> 03:24:54,470
Oop!

4514
03:24:54,470 --> 03:24:56,530
Look at all these yellow doors!

4515
03:24:57,850 --> 03:24:58,830
Whoops, wrong one.

4516
03:24:59,270 --> 03:24:59,750
Sorry.

4517
03:25:02,490 --> 03:25:03,570
Don't worry, I got you.

4518
03:25:06,090 --> 03:25:07,250
Okay, and then reload.

4519
03:25:08,390 --> 03:25:09,570
Oh, I got you!

4520
03:25:10,310 --> 03:25:11,510
Oh God, how did I miss?

4521
03:25:11,730 --> 03:25:12,610
How did I miss?

4522
03:25:12,910 --> 03:25:13,490
There you go.

4523
03:25:17,760 --> 03:25:18,780
Oh my God.

4524
03:25:19,900 --> 03:25:22,160
Look at all these yellow doors for me.

4525
03:25:24,140 --> 03:25:26,120
I'm so far away from the objective.

4526
03:25:26,120 --> 03:25:28,060
Wait, the yellow stopped.

4527
03:25:29,440 --> 03:25:30,480
Is the yellow here?

4528
03:25:30,700 --> 03:25:31,840
Oh, there's the yellow light!

4529
03:25:34,100 --> 03:25:35,220
There's the yellow light!

4530
03:25:35,980 --> 03:25:36,800
Where's the loot?

4531
03:25:38,620 --> 03:25:39,480
Where is it?

4532
03:25:40,540 --> 03:25:41,160
Oh, there...

4533
03:25:41,160 --> 03:25:41,400
Oh!

4534
03:25:41,400 --> 03:25:41,680
Woo!

4535
03:25:43,980 --> 03:25:45,580
Don't worry, my ship is okay.

4536
03:25:47,160 --> 03:25:47,840
There you go.

4537
03:25:48,480 --> 03:25:50,600
Okay, we gotta grab the mats though.

4538
03:25:51,180 --> 03:25:51,860
Mats time!

4539
03:25:53,180 --> 03:25:53,660
Assimilate.

4540
03:25:54,540 --> 03:25:55,020
Assimilate.

4541
03:25:55,040 --> 03:25:55,460
Assimilate.

4542
03:25:56,380 --> 03:25:56,900
Alright.

4543
03:25:57,140 --> 03:25:58,020
Where are...

4544
03:25:58,020 --> 03:25:59,320
Don't worry, my tank is okay.

4545
03:26:00,500 --> 03:26:02,380
Guys, my tank will be okay.

4546
03:26:04,300 --> 03:26:05,760
Where the fuck is the loot?

4547
03:26:10,580 --> 03:26:11,460
What did I get?

4548
03:26:13,620 --> 03:26:15,580
You have acquired an option module.

4549
03:26:16,100 --> 03:26:17,260
It has various effects.

4550
03:26:17,400 --> 03:26:19,560
Use them to gain advantage in battles.

4551
03:26:19,740 --> 03:26:23,400
There are special parts that cannot be crafted or upgraded on their own.

4552
03:26:23,540 --> 03:26:26,260
The effects grow together with the vehicle's level.

4553
03:26:26,740 --> 03:26:28,060
Activate using LB.

4554
03:26:28,060 --> 03:26:32,920
After using an active effect, you must wait for the cooldown.

4555
03:26:34,560 --> 03:26:35,120
Oh!

4556
03:26:36,660 --> 03:26:39,740
Prince, I can't lend you a hand right now.

4557
03:26:40,180 --> 03:26:42,420
Wait, I have to activate my...

4558
03:26:42,420 --> 03:26:43,260
Oh my god.

4559
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:47,940
I thought he was already doing that for me.

4560
03:26:48,280 --> 03:26:48,900
Alright, guys.

4561
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:50,780
Is there any doors back here?

4562
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:51,580
Just in case.

4563
03:26:52,320 --> 03:26:53,280
Alright, no doors.

4564
03:26:54,080 --> 03:26:54,640
Alright.

4565
03:26:55,260 --> 03:26:57,340
So I can customize my vehicle.

4566
03:26:57,340 --> 03:26:58,040
Where is it?

4567
03:26:58,040 --> 03:26:58,620
Is it this?

4568
03:27:01,700 --> 03:27:02,540
Automatic fires.

4569
03:27:02,680 --> 03:27:03,960
Oh, automatic fires.

4570
03:27:04,160 --> 03:27:04,880
Okay, guys.

4571
03:27:05,500 --> 03:27:05,940
Guys.

4572
03:27:06,660 --> 03:27:07,520
Guys, I'm sorry.

4573
03:27:10,180 --> 03:27:11,280
Is it this?

4574
03:27:20,730 --> 03:27:21,530
That's so cool.

4575
03:27:22,890 --> 03:27:23,550
Activated it.

4576
03:27:25,210 --> 03:27:26,190
Alright, we gotta go back.

4577
03:27:26,430 --> 03:27:29,050
Okay, I think I gotta heal my tank a little bit.

4578
03:27:29,130 --> 03:27:29,710
Just a...

4579
03:27:29,710 --> 03:27:30,990
Just a maybe.

4580
03:27:36,130 --> 03:27:36,690
Um...

4581
03:27:38,990 --> 03:27:39,550
Just...

4582
03:27:39,550 --> 03:27:41,150
Just a maybe.

4583
03:27:41,310 --> 03:27:42,130
How do I...

4584
03:27:42,130 --> 03:27:43,550
Okay, restore...

4585
03:27:43,550 --> 03:27:44,450
There we go.

4586
03:27:44,850 --> 03:27:45,410
Alright.

4587
03:27:46,050 --> 03:27:47,050
We did it.

4588
03:27:48,590 --> 03:27:49,150
Good.

4589
03:27:51,430 --> 03:27:53,550
There came a point where like...

4590
03:27:53,550 --> 03:27:54,170
I was like...

4591
03:27:54,170 --> 03:27:56,770
There was maybe a little bit too much...

4592
03:27:56,770 --> 03:27:59,930
A little bit too much glow-y.

4593
03:28:00,070 --> 03:28:01,410
Wait, have I been through there?

4594
03:28:02,110 --> 03:28:03,590
Wait, there's another yellow door.

4595
03:28:05,850 --> 03:28:07,130
Is this where I came from?

4596
03:28:07,230 --> 03:28:08,470
Oh, this is where I came from.

4597
03:28:08,970 --> 03:28:10,510
Wait, there's a level 16?

4598
03:28:11,230 --> 03:28:13,350
Guys, I think I can take him.

4599
03:28:14,070 --> 03:28:16,090
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

4600
03:28:16,930 --> 03:28:18,750
I think I can take him.

4601
03:28:19,070 --> 03:28:19,910
Watch this.

4602
03:28:20,930 --> 03:28:21,710
Watch this.

4603
03:28:23,450 --> 03:28:24,650
Guys, watch this.

4604
03:28:24,710 --> 03:28:25,410
You know why I know?

4605
03:28:26,010 --> 03:28:28,250
Because he can come in through here.

4606
03:28:32,470 --> 03:28:33,390
Guys, watch this.

4607
03:28:33,590 --> 03:28:34,550
There's no way.

4608
03:28:34,670 --> 03:28:35,330
Watch, guys.

4609
03:28:36,050 --> 03:28:37,310
I can take him.

4610
03:28:37,470 --> 03:28:38,870
Guys, what is he gonna do?

4611
03:28:38,890 --> 03:28:39,990
Go through that door?

4612
03:28:43,690 --> 03:28:45,050
That's fucking right.

4613
03:28:45,950 --> 03:28:46,990
That's fucking right.

4614
03:28:47,070 --> 03:28:48,390
What are you gonna do about it?

4615
03:28:48,730 --> 03:28:49,410
That's right.

4616
03:28:49,610 --> 03:28:50,790
Oh, he went through the door!

4617
03:28:51,190 --> 03:28:54,110
Guys, guys, he went through the door!

4618
03:28:54,550 --> 03:28:56,190
He was not too thick!

4619
03:28:56,270 --> 03:28:58,030
I thought he'd be too thick, guys!

4620
03:29:03,140 --> 03:29:03,620
Guys!

4621
03:29:03,900 --> 03:29:04,780
He was not too thick!

4622
03:29:04,800 --> 03:29:05,380
He was not thick!

4623
03:29:06,540 --> 03:29:08,180
He was appropriately sized!

4624
03:29:13,680 --> 03:29:14,440
That's okay.

4625
03:29:14,600 --> 03:29:15,340
That's okay.

4626
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:16,880
He's so far from me.

4627
03:29:17,160 --> 03:29:17,960
It's okay.

4628
03:29:18,320 --> 03:29:20,060
The ricochet from this.

4629
03:29:20,400 --> 03:29:21,460
He's too far.

4630
03:29:22,080 --> 03:29:23,060
He's too far.

4631
03:29:23,260 --> 03:29:24,060
We did it.

4632
03:29:24,180 --> 03:29:25,900
I knew we could do it.

4633
03:29:26,820 --> 03:29:28,320
Guys, look at that.

4634
03:29:28,500 --> 03:29:31,320
I get 7 XP for that?

4635
03:29:31,860 --> 03:29:33,160
That's a bullshit!

4636
03:29:36,520 --> 03:29:38,080
Oh my god!

4637
03:29:38,160 --> 03:29:39,960
That's actually bullshit!

4638
03:29:41,820 --> 03:29:45,440
I can't believe I only get like 7 XP.

4639
03:29:47,640 --> 03:29:49,300
I can't believe it.

4640
03:29:49,320 --> 03:29:50,420
That was a bounty, right?

4641
03:29:51,640 --> 03:29:53,500
That had to be a bounty.

4642
03:29:54,420 --> 03:29:56,780
But the loot token...

4643
03:29:56,780 --> 03:29:58,620
But how am I gonna level up?

4644
03:29:59,380 --> 03:30:01,200
It's all about the levels.

4645
03:30:01,740 --> 03:30:03,160
Think, chat.

4646
03:30:03,260 --> 03:30:03,640
Think.

4647
03:30:04,900 --> 03:30:07,080
That was not worth it.

4648
03:30:07,280 --> 03:30:07,740
Wow!

4649
03:30:08,740 --> 03:30:10,380
I thought I died from that.

4650
03:30:10,580 --> 03:30:11,400
How did I get there?

4651
03:30:12,300 --> 03:30:13,300
Okay, this way.

4652
03:30:13,520 --> 03:30:14,220
This way.

4653
03:30:14,820 --> 03:30:16,820
And now walk over from here.

4654
03:30:17,860 --> 03:30:19,020
And then... Yeah!

4655
03:30:19,620 --> 03:30:20,300
Oh!

4656
03:30:20,380 --> 03:30:21,060
Here we go!

4657
03:30:22,300 --> 03:30:23,600
Okay, now!

4658
03:30:24,220 --> 03:30:24,900
Yay!

4659
03:30:27,520 --> 03:30:29,000
Okay, we're through the door.

4660
03:30:29,640 --> 03:30:30,320
Hello!

4661
03:30:31,480 --> 03:30:33,060
Okay, this is like...

4662
03:30:33,060 --> 03:30:34,280
Wait, can I...

4663
03:30:34,280 --> 03:30:36,980
Prince, I can't lend you a hand right now.

4664
03:30:36,980 --> 03:30:37,900
No, help me!

4665
03:30:38,240 --> 03:30:39,200
Help me loot!

4666
03:30:39,540 --> 03:30:40,980
There's so much loot here!

4667
03:30:41,800 --> 03:30:42,960
Wait, where am I?

4668
03:30:43,760 --> 03:30:44,900
There has to be...

4669
03:30:44,900 --> 03:30:46,740
There's a level 5 thug here!

4670
03:30:46,920 --> 03:30:47,740
Let's beat him up!

4671
03:30:50,880 --> 03:30:51,840
That's fucking right.

4672
03:30:51,880 --> 03:30:52,860
Give me your lunch money.

4673
03:30:55,540 --> 03:30:56,880
Wait, am I supposed...

4674
03:30:56,880 --> 03:30:57,160
Oh, hey!

4675
03:30:57,260 --> 03:30:57,640
Nice!

4676
03:30:57,820 --> 03:30:58,640
Hey, little chip!

4677
03:30:59,460 --> 03:30:59,940
Yeah!

4678
03:31:02,380 --> 03:31:03,880
Alright, we go here.

4679
03:31:06,980 --> 03:31:07,820
Okay, guys.

4680
03:31:07,940 --> 03:31:08,700
Guys, guys, guys!

4681
03:31:08,800 --> 03:31:09,320
Pause, pause!

4682
03:31:09,620 --> 03:31:10,320
Pause, guys!

4683
03:31:11,580 --> 03:31:12,520
Guys, pause!

4684
03:31:12,800 --> 03:31:13,400
Pause, guys!

4685
03:31:13,620 --> 03:31:14,060
Pause!

4686
03:31:16,140 --> 03:31:17,780
Thank you for waiting.

4687
03:31:18,000 --> 03:31:19,500
I really appreciate it.

4688
03:31:21,620 --> 03:31:23,020
Oh my god!

4689
03:31:23,180 --> 03:31:24,620
Holy shit, that actually hurt!

4690
03:31:25,760 --> 03:31:27,220
At least they waited though.

4691
03:31:29,940 --> 03:31:30,680
And then we go this way.

4692
03:31:37,780 --> 03:31:38,220
Loot!

4693
03:31:41,040 --> 03:31:41,480
Yay!

4694
03:31:42,140 --> 03:31:42,960
Is there loot here?

4695
03:31:43,280 --> 03:31:44,000
Loot, loot, loot!

4696
03:31:44,140 --> 03:31:44,380
No!

4697
03:31:44,500 --> 03:31:45,700
Guys, close the door!

4698
03:31:48,640 --> 03:31:50,940
Don't you hate it when the homies don't close the door?

4699
03:31:54,280 --> 03:31:54,720
Abra...

4700
03:31:56,540 --> 03:31:56,980
Cadabra.

4701
03:31:58,120 --> 03:31:58,560
Magic.

4702
03:31:59,520 --> 03:32:00,140
Wait, what?

4703
03:32:00,140 --> 03:32:01,820
Oh, there it is.

4704
03:32:01,960 --> 03:32:03,940
I was like... I swore I saw like glowing stuff.

4705
03:32:05,600 --> 03:32:06,080
Yay!

4706
03:32:06,080 --> 03:32:07,220
Heavy gallon gun.

4707
03:32:07,860 --> 03:32:08,440
What's that?

4708
03:32:08,660 --> 03:32:09,100
A trap?

4709
03:32:10,160 --> 03:32:11,300
There's no traps here.

4710
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:13,880
Get over here.

4711
03:32:13,980 --> 03:32:14,560
Get over here.

4712
03:32:14,980 --> 03:32:15,940
Get over here.

4713
03:32:16,040 --> 03:32:16,900
Fight me at my level.

4714
03:32:17,540 --> 03:32:18,240
There you go.

4715
03:32:19,080 --> 03:32:19,560
Yeah!

4716
03:32:22,420 --> 03:32:23,900
That's the worst trap ever.

4717
03:32:24,440 --> 03:32:27,240
Tango and Super Waifu, welcome to the tomato farm!

4718
03:32:27,320 --> 03:32:27,960
Welcome, welcome!

4719
03:32:28,500 --> 03:32:29,220
Alright, we go up.

4720
03:32:32,100 --> 03:32:32,580
Let's see.

4721
03:32:32,660 --> 03:32:35,380
Okay, that is where the actual thing is.

4722
03:32:35,480 --> 03:32:37,140
There's no loot here, so we'll go this way.

4723
03:32:37,780 --> 03:32:38,980
Alright, hello guys!

4724
03:32:40,160 --> 03:32:40,560
Hello!

4725
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:43,900
That's fucking right.

4726
03:32:43,960 --> 03:32:44,360
Get down.

4727
03:32:44,960 --> 03:32:46,400
Fight me at my level!

4728
03:32:50,620 --> 03:32:51,900
Ooh, that's a big boy.

4729
03:32:52,140 --> 03:32:52,540
Yellow!

4730
03:32:53,240 --> 03:32:54,420
Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot!

4731
03:32:55,500 --> 03:32:56,600
Loot, loot, loot, loot, loot!

4732
03:32:57,100 --> 03:32:57,980
There's loot here.

4733
03:32:59,720 --> 03:33:00,120
There's loot here.

4734
03:33:01,400 --> 03:33:02,260
Where's the yellow?

4735
03:33:03,880 --> 03:33:07,440
You can't just bait me with the yellow and then disappear like that.

4736
03:33:08,620 --> 03:33:09,540
There it is!

4737
03:33:10,960 --> 03:33:11,440
Loot.

4738
03:33:12,780 --> 03:33:14,100
He's just a little guy.

4739
03:33:14,220 --> 03:33:14,920
Yeah, he is.

4740
03:33:15,480 --> 03:33:16,440
Okay, parkour.

4741
03:33:17,400 --> 03:33:18,440
There's more over there.

4742
03:33:20,680 --> 03:33:21,160
Nice.

4743
03:33:21,180 --> 03:33:22,280
And that's how you parkour.

4744
03:33:24,500 --> 03:33:25,420
I'm a gamer.

4745
03:33:27,880 --> 03:33:28,640
Is that it?

4746
03:33:30,140 --> 03:33:30,960
Is that everything?

4747
03:33:31,280 --> 03:33:32,080
I think that was everything.

4748
03:33:33,180 --> 03:33:34,120
Yeah, you fail.

4749
03:33:34,180 --> 03:33:35,760
You have to do the walk of shame.

4750
03:33:37,120 --> 03:33:37,980
Not me.

4751
03:33:40,540 --> 03:33:41,100
Boop!

4752
03:33:42,340 --> 03:33:44,020
Thank god for the yellow lights.

4753
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:46,420
I'm so glad they thought of everything.

4754
03:33:46,980 --> 03:33:48,480
Can I just run past it?

4755
03:33:48,620 --> 03:33:49,840
Oh no, I can't.

4756
03:33:51,580 --> 03:33:52,360
It's okay.

4757
03:33:53,840 --> 03:33:55,300
I've killed your dad.

4758
03:33:55,500 --> 03:33:56,400
You're nothing!

4759
03:33:58,000 --> 03:33:58,560
Boop!

4760
03:34:00,140 --> 03:34:02,480
Oh my god, he did so much damage!

4761
03:34:03,180 --> 03:34:04,680
Okay, maybe he is something.

4762
03:34:05,540 --> 03:34:06,460
There you go.

4763
03:34:08,580 --> 03:34:09,100
Alright.

4764
03:34:09,620 --> 03:34:12,380
Guys, there is a possibility that he is something.

4765
03:34:13,580 --> 03:34:15,200
Oh, this looks like a boss room.

4766
03:34:16,800 --> 03:34:17,320
100%.

4767
03:34:18,040 --> 03:34:19,560
Eh, I guess not.

4768
03:34:21,200 --> 03:34:22,700
Not really, actually.

4769
03:34:23,860 --> 03:34:24,980
It's just two guys.

4770
03:34:25,300 --> 03:34:26,520
What are two guys gonna do?

4771
03:34:27,220 --> 03:34:27,740
Boop!

4772
03:34:28,900 --> 03:34:29,420
Boop!

4773
03:34:30,580 --> 03:34:31,160
Boop!

4774
03:34:31,880 --> 03:34:32,780
Wait, I missed?

4775
03:34:33,080 --> 03:34:33,920
There you go.

4776
03:34:34,020 --> 03:34:35,400
At least that was sort of fun.

4777
03:34:35,620 --> 03:34:35,980
Yay!

4778
03:34:37,740 --> 03:34:40,240
I have so much mats right now.

4779
03:34:40,300 --> 03:34:42,000
I have not used a single...

4780
03:34:42,000 --> 03:34:47,480
I just noticed I have so much mats but I have not actually used anything.

4781
03:34:48,460 --> 03:34:49,880
Oh, I... Oh, loot.

4782
03:34:50,060 --> 03:34:50,640
Okay.

4783
03:34:53,300 --> 03:34:56,060
I haven't upgraded anything on my tank.

4784
03:34:56,360 --> 03:34:58,140
I wasn't allowed to!

4785
03:34:58,140 --> 03:34:59,900
There was nothing to upgrade!

4786
03:35:00,940 --> 03:35:02,040
I swear!

4787
03:35:02,160 --> 03:35:04,300
There was nothing to upgrade at all!

4788
03:35:05,880 --> 03:35:08,620
If there was, I would have upgraded like years ago.

4789
03:35:09,580 --> 03:35:10,580
Alright, grab this.

4790
03:35:14,040 --> 03:35:14,860
There you go.

4791
03:35:14,920 --> 03:35:15,340
Oh, wait.

4792
03:35:15,480 --> 03:35:16,080
Did I miss?

4793
03:35:16,340 --> 03:35:16,680
No.

4794
03:35:16,960 --> 03:35:18,020
It just moved.

4795
03:35:19,720 --> 03:35:20,500
There you go.

4796
03:35:21,520 --> 03:35:22,080
Yay!

4797
03:35:23,980 --> 03:35:27,580
I can't believe I can't fucking blast those boxes open.

4798
03:35:27,580 --> 03:35:30,000
This place is practically falling apart!

4799
03:35:30,780 --> 03:35:33,060
I just didn't get the loot.

4800
03:35:33,340 --> 03:35:34,440
Flo and Steady?

4801
03:35:34,580 --> 03:35:35,660
Oh, wait.

4802
03:35:35,660 --> 03:35:36,720
That's an abyss.

4803
03:35:37,020 --> 03:35:38,180
Let's proceed with care.

4804
03:35:39,420 --> 03:35:40,100
Weeeee!

4805
03:35:42,500 --> 03:35:43,720
I'm gonna keep running.

4806
03:35:45,060 --> 03:35:45,740
Loot!

4807
03:35:49,050 --> 03:35:49,730
Loot!

4808
03:35:51,370 --> 03:35:52,050
Where?

4809
03:35:55,740 --> 03:35:56,640
Where is it?

4810
03:35:56,780 --> 03:35:57,420
Here we go.

4811
03:35:57,620 --> 03:35:58,740
Let's blow up.

4812
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:00,680
Uh...

4813
03:36:00,700 --> 03:36:02,480
Oh my god, where is it?

4814
03:36:03,020 --> 03:36:03,640
Where is it?

4815
03:36:05,060 --> 03:36:06,480
They can't bait me like this!

4816
03:36:07,740 --> 03:36:08,100
Okay.

4817
03:36:10,940 --> 03:36:12,460
I need to be a loot goblin!

4818
03:36:15,620 --> 03:36:16,840
Okay, we got...

4819
03:36:16,840 --> 03:36:17,120
Nope.

4820
03:36:18,300 --> 03:36:19,820
Guys, I think my tank will be okay.

4821
03:36:20,500 --> 03:36:22,100
And then here...

4822
03:36:22,660 --> 03:36:23,620
Is that all of them?

4823
03:36:23,820 --> 03:36:24,900
That should be all of them.

4824
03:36:25,020 --> 03:36:25,840
I see it!

4825
03:36:26,300 --> 03:36:27,660
I see the glowing box!

4826
03:36:28,620 --> 03:36:28,980
Guys.

4827
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:30,440
Oh.

4828
03:36:31,320 --> 03:36:32,240
Here we go.

4829
03:36:32,360 --> 03:36:33,220
I have to get it.

4830
03:36:33,440 --> 03:36:34,920
I see something shiny.

4831
03:36:36,020 --> 03:36:37,480
And I must have it.

4832
03:36:39,640 --> 03:36:41,000
Bro, I ain't afraid of you.

4833
03:36:42,920 --> 03:36:45,800
You gotta chase me down first if you wanna do anything.

4834
03:36:47,920 --> 03:36:49,140
Here we go.

4835
03:36:50,960 --> 03:36:51,480
Boop.

4836
03:36:52,820 --> 03:36:53,340
Boop.

4837
03:36:53,720 --> 03:36:54,240
Oh!

4838
03:36:54,620 --> 03:36:55,140
Whoa!

4839
03:36:56,980 --> 03:36:57,500
Ow!

4840
03:36:57,680 --> 03:36:57,880
Ow!

4841
03:36:59,140 --> 03:37:00,260
Don't make me mad!

4842
03:37:00,460 --> 03:37:01,700
Don't make me angry!

4843
03:37:01,840 --> 03:37:02,920
I'm coming over here!

4844
03:37:04,080 --> 03:37:05,200
That's fucking right!

4845
03:37:06,720 --> 03:37:07,800
I'll spare you!

4846
03:37:07,980 --> 03:37:09,080
Tell your friends!

4847
03:37:11,780 --> 03:37:12,300
Wait.

4848
03:37:12,540 --> 03:37:13,420
Guys, pause.

4849
03:37:13,600 --> 03:37:13,900
Pause.

4850
03:37:13,980 --> 03:37:15,180
I need to upgrade my stuff.

4851
03:37:16,320 --> 03:37:16,840
Uh...

4852
03:37:16,840 --> 03:37:17,060
Wait!

4853
03:37:17,140 --> 03:37:18,240
The damage sucks!

4854
03:37:19,640 --> 03:37:20,720
What the fuck?

4855
03:37:22,560 --> 03:37:25,120
It's not even bigger da- Oh, wait.

4856
03:37:25,340 --> 03:37:27,040
No, that's not even bigger damage.

4857
03:37:28,040 --> 03:37:28,960
The damage sucks!

4858
03:37:28,960 --> 03:37:29,640
This damage is terrible!

4859
03:37:30,880 --> 03:37:32,060
I lied too.

4860
03:37:33,480 --> 03:37:34,520
Okay, this way.

4861
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:36,480
More ammo.

4862
03:37:36,580 --> 03:37:37,260
I don't need ammo!

4863
03:37:38,400 --> 03:37:39,940
I'm all in on the damage!

4864
03:37:40,720 --> 03:37:42,520
Zero defense, full damage.

4865
03:37:45,240 --> 03:37:48,980
If I kill them first, then like, I won't get hurt.

4866
03:37:49,160 --> 03:37:49,900
I won't get hit.

4867
03:37:53,570 --> 03:37:54,690
Alright, this way.

4868
03:37:56,170 --> 03:37:56,690
Woah.

4869
03:37:56,990 --> 03:37:58,390
Woah, we went 2D here.

4870
03:37:58,390 --> 03:37:58,630
What?

4871
03:38:01,050 --> 03:38:01,670
Woah!

4872
03:38:01,670 --> 03:38:02,290
What?

4873
03:38:03,070 --> 03:38:04,330
Oh my god!

4874
03:38:06,550 --> 03:38:08,310
Wait, but how do I...

4875
03:38:08,310 --> 03:38:08,890
AHHHH!

4876
03:38:10,350 --> 03:38:12,190
I didn't expect it.

4877
03:38:14,630 --> 03:38:16,890
I did not expect the 2D part.

4878
03:38:18,390 --> 03:38:19,970
We went 2D, 3D.

4879
03:38:22,710 --> 03:38:24,750
Now it's a real platformer.

4880
03:38:24,750 --> 03:38:24,910
Yeah.

4881
03:38:25,410 --> 03:38:27,110
I know there was loot back here.

4882
03:38:28,710 --> 03:38:29,370
Huh!

4883
03:38:30,610 --> 03:38:30,930
Yep.

4884
03:38:32,010 --> 03:38:33,070
Nothing gonna do.

4885
03:38:33,230 --> 03:38:33,630
Nothing.

4886
03:38:34,010 --> 03:38:35,330
It's just gonna explode anyway.

4887
03:38:35,930 --> 03:38:36,450
Yay!

4888
03:38:37,970 --> 03:38:39,830
It's Crash Bandicoot time.

4889
03:38:39,970 --> 03:38:40,270
Yeah!

4890
03:38:40,670 --> 03:38:42,590
I was like, what the fuck?

4891
03:38:42,650 --> 03:38:43,670
It just came out of nowhere.

4892
03:38:45,230 --> 03:38:45,890
Yay!

4893
03:38:46,310 --> 03:38:46,910
Tank time.

4894
03:38:48,230 --> 03:38:49,390
Go tank, go!

4895
03:38:54,490 --> 03:38:55,150
Nice.

4896
03:38:56,110 --> 03:38:56,770
Goodbye.

4897
03:38:58,890 --> 03:38:59,450
Goodbye.

4898
03:39:00,230 --> 03:39:02,210
I need a platform for my tank.

4899
03:39:04,550 --> 03:39:05,110
Yay!

4900
03:39:06,290 --> 03:39:09,410
No one expects the 2D Inquisition.

4901
03:39:12,430 --> 03:39:14,010
Is that... It's a jumper!

4902
03:39:14,310 --> 03:39:15,090
Is that the jumper?

4903
03:39:22,070 --> 03:39:23,330
Oh my god, is that mine?

4904
03:39:24,790 --> 03:39:26,430
Oh my god, he looks so cool!

4905
03:39:26,990 --> 03:39:28,770
I'm done playing with you now.

4906
03:39:31,970 --> 03:39:34,890
He's cooler because there is more color on it.

4907
03:39:36,590 --> 03:39:41,010
It looks so 2D...I love the texture on that model chat.

4908
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:47,270
I feel like the texture on this 3D model looks a little It looks 2D.

4909
03:39:47,550 --> 03:39:48,790
That's actually insane.

4910
03:39:49,170 --> 03:39:52,650
I can't pretend I didn't just hear that pinch-squeak!

4911
03:39:55,570 --> 03:39:56,230
Hmm..

4912
03:40:02,830 --> 03:40:05,410
Your budget ran out for this scene.

4913
03:40:08,710 --> 03:40:12,030
I'm not allowed to play more than one hour of video games though apparently.

4914
03:40:17,710 --> 03:40:19,870
Look they ran out of money!

4915
03:40:21,430 --> 03:40:24,050
They had me do the long chair.

4916
03:40:24,050 --> 03:40:25,270
Who paid that much?

4917
03:40:26,210 --> 03:40:30,230
We're here on a job to deal with that jump bot from a junkers market resident.

4918
03:40:31,350 --> 03:40:33,930
Can't we just work out a peaceful solution?

4919
03:40:35,830 --> 03:40:36,430
No!

4920
03:40:37,150 --> 03:40:37,750
Peaceful?

4921
03:40:37,850 --> 03:40:39,150
Does he look like peaceful?

4922
03:40:43,050 --> 03:40:43,650
What?

4923
03:40:43,650 --> 03:40:45,990
You not used to seeing girls either?

4924
03:40:47,570 --> 03:40:51,190
Nah, what I'm interested in is your necklace.

4925
03:40:52,270 --> 03:40:52,870
Necklace?

4926
03:40:53,210 --> 03:40:54,030
Better close it.

4927
03:40:54,050 --> 03:40:55,870
I could get a damn good price for it.

4928
03:40:56,290 --> 03:40:58,150
I'll take that as payment.

4929
03:41:00,230 --> 03:41:01,030
No way!

4930
03:41:01,130 --> 03:41:03,010
I'll never give this up no matter what!

4931
03:41:03,010 --> 03:41:03,370
Yeah!

4932
03:41:03,450 --> 03:41:03,970
No!

4933
03:41:06,830 --> 03:41:07,870
Too bad!

4934
03:41:08,150 --> 03:41:12,470
When I see something I want, I ain't in the habit of letting it go.

4935
03:41:15,670 --> 03:41:16,190
What?

4936
03:41:18,230 --> 03:41:19,170
What the fuck?

4937
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:19,830
Where did he- what?

4938
03:41:19,950 --> 03:41:20,830
He's so fast!

4939
03:41:21,750 --> 03:41:22,590
Oh wait!

4940
03:41:22,670 --> 03:41:23,670
It's a different person!

4941
03:41:26,350 --> 03:41:27,530
I was like- whoa!

4942
03:41:28,730 --> 03:41:29,730
Give it back!

4943
03:41:29,970 --> 03:41:32,110
That necklace means everything to me!

4944
03:41:32,270 --> 03:41:33,330
Stand back, Anne.

4945
03:41:33,670 --> 03:41:35,770
It's my turn to repay you.

4946
03:41:36,590 --> 03:41:37,410
For what?

4947
03:41:37,570 --> 03:41:38,370
Yeah, for what?

4948
03:41:38,450 --> 03:41:39,010
I mean, same.

4949
03:41:41,390 --> 03:41:45,090
Even you're no match for my jump bot, demon boy!

4950
03:41:45,470 --> 03:41:46,430
Holy shit!

4951
03:41:46,450 --> 03:41:47,970
There's missiles on that jump bot!

4952
03:41:50,070 --> 03:41:50,990
Oh god!

4953
03:41:51,070 --> 03:41:51,690
Guys, guys!

4954
03:41:51,750 --> 03:41:53,210
Remember I said I don't need heals?

4955
03:41:53,350 --> 03:41:53,650
Okay!

4956
03:41:53,650 --> 03:42:00,110
I'm gonna repair my- I realized that I might need a re- Wait, wait, wait.

4957
03:42:00,490 --> 03:42:00,970
Interception!

4958
03:42:01,990 --> 03:42:02,910
Do your thing!

4959
03:42:03,310 --> 03:42:03,790
Intercept!

4960
03:42:05,890 --> 03:42:07,150
Oh no, I have to reload.

4961
03:42:07,330 --> 03:42:10,430
I didn't go into the fight- I didn't reload while- Guys!

4962
03:42:11,130 --> 03:42:13,350
Guys, I made the most fatal mistake!

4963
03:42:13,950 --> 03:42:15,330
I didn't reload!

4964
03:42:18,750 --> 03:42:20,390
Shoot him down with the machine!

4965
03:42:21,510 --> 03:42:22,030
What?

4966
03:42:22,150 --> 03:42:26,350
Oh, the- Not reloading before the fight, guys.

4967
03:42:26,590 --> 03:42:32,790
I- I made- I made the most common mistake.

4968
03:42:33,250 --> 03:42:34,210
Time to get crazy!

4969
03:42:35,130 --> 03:42:37,130
Oh no, he's gonna get crazy, guys.

4970
03:42:37,450 --> 03:42:40,790
He's gonna jump so fucking crazy!

4971
03:42:42,290 --> 03:42:43,590
Where am I looking at?

4972
03:42:44,850 --> 03:42:45,570
What is that?

4973
03:42:45,670 --> 03:42:45,790
Oh.

4974
03:42:45,970 --> 03:42:47,730
I have to play my ace in the hole!

4975
03:42:48,050 --> 03:42:48,410
What?

4976
03:42:48,490 --> 03:42:48,930
This?

4977
03:42:48,930 --> 03:42:49,750
Oh!

4978
03:42:50,950 --> 03:42:52,050
Stop, you prince!

4979
03:42:52,270 --> 03:42:53,450
Get ready to dodge!

4980
03:42:54,130 --> 03:42:54,650
What?

4981
03:42:54,830 --> 03:42:56,010
Guys, I did it!

4982
03:42:56,690 --> 03:42:57,310
Ah, crap!

4983
03:42:59,700 --> 03:43:01,760
Okay, I'm fucking putting on autopilot.

4984
03:43:02,000 --> 03:43:04,380
Oh shit, no!

4985
03:43:04,600 --> 03:43:06,660
That autopilot was a mistake, guys!

4986
03:43:07,940 --> 03:43:08,460
Oh!

4987
03:43:10,840 --> 03:43:12,200
Good job, prince!

4988
03:43:12,680 --> 03:43:14,440
Oh my god, controller aiming.

4989
03:43:19,310 --> 03:43:19,830
Nitro!

4990
03:43:22,770 --> 03:43:23,150
Okay.

4991
03:43:24,110 --> 03:43:24,830
Nice, we're fine.

4992
03:43:25,450 --> 03:43:26,410
We're halfway through!

4993
03:43:27,850 --> 03:43:28,450
Come on!

4994
03:43:28,790 --> 03:43:29,210
Critical-

4995
03:43:33,300 --> 03:43:34,160
Alright, I hear you.

4996
03:43:34,340 --> 03:43:36,040
Oh, I can shoot him while he's just standing there.

4997
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:37,940
Oh my god, thank god.

4998
03:43:42,660 --> 03:43:44,920
Thank god I could just, like, you know, stab.

4999
03:43:46,320 --> 03:43:47,860
Wait, can I shoot him out of the air?

5000
03:43:49,180 --> 03:43:51,340
Thank god, he just stands there menacingly.

5001
03:43:52,700 --> 03:43:53,080
Oh!

5002
03:43:54,920 --> 03:43:55,440
Come on.

5003
03:43:55,440 --> 03:43:56,740
Just stay still!

5004
03:43:57,420 --> 03:43:58,840
Just a little more, prince!

5005
03:43:59,320 --> 03:44:00,480
He's gonna blow up!

5006
03:44:01,800 --> 03:44:02,500
Oh no.

5007
03:44:02,600 --> 03:44:03,520
I didn't miss, guys.

5008
03:44:03,980 --> 03:44:04,840
That was a hit.

5009
03:44:06,240 --> 03:44:07,280
Okay, and then...

5010
03:44:07,280 --> 03:44:08,160
Oh my god, he's only...

5011
03:44:08,160 --> 03:44:08,540
He's 1 HP!

5012
03:44:08,620 --> 03:44:09,000
He's 1 HP!

5013
03:44:09,300 --> 03:44:09,740
Goodbye!

5014
03:44:10,340 --> 03:44:10,780
Yes!

5015
03:44:18,950 --> 03:44:19,390
Here.

5016
03:44:21,190 --> 03:44:22,390
Thank you, BLs.

5017
03:44:23,410 --> 03:44:24,390
What did you mean...

5018
03:44:24,390 --> 03:44:25,590
What happened to the other person?

5019
03:44:27,730 --> 03:44:28,170
Huh?

5020
03:44:28,410 --> 03:44:29,050
Yeah, what did I...

5021
03:44:29,050 --> 03:44:29,450
What did...

5022
03:44:29,450 --> 03:44:30,610
What did she do?

5023
03:44:31,890 --> 03:44:33,110
Oh, the bullet!

5024
03:44:33,730 --> 03:44:34,930
You must be the time you took a bullet for him.

5025
03:44:35,090 --> 03:44:35,910
I remember!

5026
03:44:37,630 --> 03:44:38,730
It's the bullet!

5027
03:44:39,210 --> 03:44:41,670
You know, BLs, you're a pretty stand-up guy.

5028
03:44:42,910 --> 03:44:44,430
Stop before I puke!

5029
03:44:46,210 --> 03:44:50,850
Not to bring down the mood, but you did a real number on the bot, BLs.

5030
03:44:51,490 --> 03:44:52,050
No!

5031
03:44:53,410 --> 03:44:54,710
My new toy!

5032
03:44:58,590 --> 03:44:59,710
Hmm... Nah.

5033
03:45:00,610 --> 03:45:02,090
I think we can work with this.

5034
03:45:02,710 --> 03:45:03,750
Oh, thank god.

5035
03:45:03,770 --> 03:45:07,450
All those items I hoarded, finally, it's gonna be used for something.

5036
03:45:07,730 --> 03:45:08,630
The Warframe is still intact.

5037
03:45:09,070 --> 03:45:11,330
I can figure out the rest somehow or other.

5038
03:45:15,820 --> 03:45:19,300
Let's get back to Spino and rebuild this thing then!

5039
03:45:21,700 --> 03:45:24,400
Let this be a lesson to you, to change your ways...

5040
03:45:24,400 --> 03:45:24,660
Yeah!

5041
03:45:24,920 --> 03:45:26,080
Evil doesn't pay!

5042
03:45:27,620 --> 03:45:30,420
There can only be one evil person in the world.

5043
03:45:31,100 --> 03:45:31,980
Lesson learned!

5044
03:45:34,460 --> 03:45:36,100
Don't encroach on my territory!

5045
03:45:39,850 --> 03:45:40,690
Level up!

5046
03:45:42,150 --> 03:45:42,710
Yay!

5047
03:45:43,350 --> 03:45:44,510
Okay, what can I get?

5048
03:45:44,690 --> 03:45:47,210
Raise his power, perform a leg sweep.

5049
03:45:47,590 --> 03:45:51,410
A leg sweep, boost power of B attacks, hold...

5050
03:45:51,410 --> 03:45:51,870
Ooh!

5051
03:45:52,110 --> 03:45:53,390
Okay, wait, I wanna...

5052
03:45:53,890 --> 03:45:54,970
Boost power of X attacks.

5053
03:45:56,110 --> 03:45:56,670
Uh...

5054
03:45:56,670 --> 03:45:57,730
You know what?

5055
03:45:57,890 --> 03:45:59,970
I wanna boost power of X attacks later.

5056
03:46:00,190 --> 03:46:02,250
I feel like that's the best one for upgrades.

5057
03:46:03,510 --> 03:46:04,070
Uh...

5058
03:46:04,070 --> 03:46:05,650
I feel like... am I gonna get more allies?

5059
03:46:06,110 --> 03:46:07,290
Cause there's three...

5060
03:46:07,290 --> 03:46:08,470
There's three...

5061
03:46:08,930 --> 03:46:10,490
Like silhouettes at the top.

5062
03:46:10,610 --> 03:46:12,310
So does that mean I'm gonna have more allies later?

5063
03:46:13,730 --> 03:46:14,470
Let's get this...

5064
03:46:14,470 --> 03:46:15,830
Okay, do I care?

5065
03:46:16,230 --> 03:46:17,590
Duration of...

5066
03:46:17,590 --> 03:46:23,470
Increases duration of vehicle warfare when he draws hostile vehicles towards his tank.

5067
03:46:23,790 --> 03:46:25,210
Temporary increase...

5068
03:46:25,210 --> 03:46:25,970
Oh!

5069
03:46:26,490 --> 03:46:27,170
What?

5070
03:46:27,490 --> 03:46:29,530
Wait, you have your own tank?

5071
03:46:29,690 --> 03:46:30,130
Okay.

5072
03:46:30,870 --> 03:46:31,210
Help.

5073
03:46:34,210 --> 03:46:35,370
Wait a minute.

5074
03:46:35,890 --> 03:46:36,370
Okay.

5075
03:46:37,050 --> 03:46:39,430
I didn't realize he has his own tank.

5076
03:46:39,930 --> 03:46:43,010
I was afraid I'd blown my chance at riding a jump buck for a second.

5077
03:46:44,250 --> 03:46:46,550
Prince, you need to learn to control yourself.

5078
03:46:46,550 --> 03:46:47,590
Try and thank him for the super chat.

5079
03:46:47,670 --> 03:46:47,930
Thank you.

5080
03:46:48,070 --> 03:46:48,490
Thank you.

5081
03:46:48,570 --> 03:46:49,350
Oh, super sticker.

5082
03:46:49,790 --> 03:46:49,810
Wait, now you mean.

5083
03:46:50,010 --> 03:46:52,030
We got what we came for, right?

5084
03:46:52,710 --> 03:46:54,110
Oh, wait, there's items here.

5085
03:46:55,950 --> 03:46:56,430
Nice.

5086
03:46:58,070 --> 03:47:01,190
But I was hoping we'd have more time to hunt for parts.

5087
03:47:02,190 --> 03:47:06,170
The wannabe junkers may be gone, but the defenders are still around.

5088
03:47:07,290 --> 03:47:10,210
So don't even think about coming in here alone.

5089
03:47:11,530 --> 03:47:12,870
I know, I know.

5090
03:47:12,990 --> 03:47:14,330
I'd never be that reckless.

5091
03:47:14,930 --> 03:47:15,450
Probably.

5092
03:47:16,950 --> 03:47:18,410
All right, time to leave.

5093
03:47:19,350 --> 03:47:22,150
Time to go back to back home.

5094
03:47:23,630 --> 03:47:24,150
Move.

5095
03:47:30,720 --> 03:47:32,460
All right, time to leave.

5096
03:47:32,880 --> 03:47:33,400
Yay!

5097
03:47:33,980 --> 03:47:34,880
Wait, have I?

5098
03:47:34,980 --> 03:47:35,580
Oh, I've been here.

5099
03:47:35,820 --> 03:47:35,980
I've been here before.

5100
03:47:36,020 --> 03:47:36,240
Okay.

5101
03:47:36,520 --> 03:47:37,840
All I have to do is just jump down.

5102
03:47:38,880 --> 03:47:39,280
Yay!

5103
03:47:40,860 --> 03:47:43,080
And then it should be here, right?

5104
03:47:45,340 --> 03:47:46,560
Can I just fast travel?

5105
03:47:49,580 --> 03:47:50,080
What's this?

5106
03:47:50,220 --> 03:47:50,380
Yeah.

5107
03:47:50,760 --> 03:47:52,060
Oh my God, I can just fast travel.

5108
03:47:52,140 --> 03:47:52,460
Thank God.

5109
03:47:52,760 --> 03:47:55,320
I was like, I am not walking back there.

5110
03:47:56,120 --> 03:47:56,640
What's wrong?

5111
03:47:57,320 --> 03:47:58,340
Aren't you going in?

5112
03:47:58,480 --> 03:47:59,140
Yeah, what's going on?

5113
03:48:01,440 --> 03:48:02,020
I am.

5114
03:48:02,560 --> 03:48:05,580
It's just there's an urgent news bulletin on the radio now.

5115
03:48:05,700 --> 03:48:05,800
Oh, okay.

5116
03:48:07,140 --> 03:48:09,400
Cause this is so fast that there's no fall damage.

5117
03:48:09,520 --> 03:48:10,740
I'm a demon too.

5118
03:48:12,060 --> 03:48:12,620
Okay.

5119
03:48:15,760 --> 03:48:21,060
Yesterday, a Royal Army tank was hijacked from that base by unknown saboteurs.

5120
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:31,220
The perpetrators have got on a rampage with their stolen tank, looting vital water supplies and destroying several towns.

5121
03:48:31,720 --> 03:48:32,280
What?

5122
03:48:32,440 --> 03:48:33,240
What the...?

5123
03:48:35,240 --> 03:48:35,800
What is going on?

5124
03:48:39,420 --> 03:48:41,500
This is not suspicious, guys.

5125
03:48:44,040 --> 03:48:45,820
I know they're asking for like...

5126
03:48:46,420 --> 03:48:48,860
Our tank is number tank 42.

5127
03:48:49,540 --> 03:48:50,520
30 million!

5128
03:48:51,940 --> 03:48:53,240
Bro, I'm just gonna turn myself in.

5129
03:48:54,660 --> 03:48:58,640
Guys, why don't we just cross out the 4 and break 105?

5130
03:49:12,090 --> 03:49:15,330
I mean, Mayor Tor trusts you guys, so...

5131
03:49:19,310 --> 03:49:20,150
Damn it.

5132
03:49:20,570 --> 03:49:22,670
How could the Royal Army sink so low?

5133
03:49:23,830 --> 03:49:25,910
Bro, just rewrite this...

5134
03:49:26,450 --> 03:49:29,090
Get fucking paint and rewrite the name!

5135
03:49:29,670 --> 03:49:31,430
We'll have to spend the rest of our lives on the run.

5136
03:49:33,170 --> 03:49:34,270
Oh my god.

5137
03:49:34,310 --> 03:49:36,710
Guys, we can like get paint!

5138
03:49:40,210 --> 03:49:42,190
30 million is 30...

5139
03:49:42,190 --> 03:49:43,030
True.

5140
03:49:45,350 --> 03:49:48,470
Like I said, I turned myself in.

5141
03:49:48,850 --> 03:49:50,350
I went the wrong way.

5142
03:49:50,610 --> 03:49:52,390
I was like, wait a minute.

5143
03:49:52,470 --> 03:49:53,190
Why am I leaving?

5144
03:49:56,930 --> 03:49:59,390
30 million is 30 million, guys.

5145
03:49:59,630 --> 03:50:00,470
Come on.

5146
03:50:00,630 --> 03:50:02,950
You turn me in if it was 30 million.

5147
03:50:04,470 --> 03:50:05,030
Alright.

5148
03:50:05,070 --> 03:50:06,330
What the fuck?

5149
03:50:07,210 --> 03:50:08,330
Strength serum...

5150
03:50:08,330 --> 03:50:10,030
Wait, where's my home?

5151
03:50:10,490 --> 03:50:13,450
There's like ceiling lights, army base...

5152
03:50:13,650 --> 03:50:16,050
What will I do with 50 chairs?

5153
03:50:19,150 --> 03:50:19,710
What?

5154
03:50:19,890 --> 03:50:21,810
Did I rob the base?

5155
03:50:22,390 --> 03:50:22,910
Like...

5156
03:50:22,910 --> 03:50:25,530
Here, thank you for the gifted chips.

5157
03:50:25,750 --> 03:50:26,270
Thank you.

5158
03:50:26,330 --> 03:50:26,930
Thank you.

5159
03:50:27,030 --> 03:50:29,510
Bro, I get 50 windows.

5160
03:50:32,270 --> 03:50:33,390
50 consoles.

5161
03:50:34,030 --> 03:50:35,510
Oh my god.

5162
03:50:36,250 --> 03:50:39,790
Bro, what the fuck am I gonna do with all these items?

5163
03:50:40,990 --> 03:50:41,910
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

5164
03:50:43,170 --> 03:50:43,890
Let's see.

5165
03:50:43,950 --> 03:50:45,570
Apparently, I robbed something.

5166
03:50:45,830 --> 03:50:46,450
Alright, parts.

5167
03:50:46,890 --> 03:50:47,650
Upgrade part.

5168
03:50:48,490 --> 03:50:49,830
I can upgrade.

5169
03:50:50,810 --> 03:50:51,370
Yay.

5170
03:50:52,510 --> 03:50:54,390
Which one is the one that I equipped though?

5171
03:50:54,590 --> 03:50:55,230
Is it the green?

5172
03:50:56,290 --> 03:50:57,190
I can't tell.

5173
03:51:01,510 --> 03:51:02,370
Customized vehicle.

5174
03:51:04,550 --> 03:51:05,450
Oh, wait.

5175
03:51:05,550 --> 03:51:05,910
It is.

5176
03:51:07,110 --> 03:51:08,950
Okay, it's the green.

5177
03:51:09,070 --> 03:51:09,310
Okay.

5178
03:51:09,370 --> 03:51:11,490
That has 97 damage.

5179
03:51:12,590 --> 03:51:12,990
24.

5180
03:51:13,570 --> 03:51:13,970
Wait.

5181
03:51:14,210 --> 03:51:14,850
What is this?

5182
03:51:15,010 --> 03:51:15,550
What's the...

5183
03:51:15,550 --> 03:51:17,090
Oh, attack interval.

5184
03:51:18,290 --> 03:51:20,370
Well, it's uncommon so it should be better.

5185
03:51:20,590 --> 03:51:20,990
Right?

5186
03:51:22,930 --> 03:51:23,510
Let's see.

5187
03:51:27,950 --> 03:51:28,350
Upgrade.

5188
03:51:28,750 --> 03:51:29,970
Oh, this is the one I equipped.

5189
03:51:30,150 --> 03:51:30,330
Okay.

5190
03:51:30,430 --> 03:51:31,210
I'm gonna upgrade this.

5191
03:51:33,490 --> 03:51:34,230
Might as well.

5192
03:51:35,050 --> 03:51:35,450
Yay!

5193
03:51:36,910 --> 03:51:38,370
I mean, I have so much money.

5194
03:51:38,510 --> 03:51:39,490
I might as well.

5195
03:51:39,550 --> 03:51:40,090
You know?

5196
03:51:41,610 --> 03:51:41,970
Okay.

5197
03:51:42,250 --> 03:51:42,610
Upgrade.

5198
03:51:43,970 --> 03:51:44,330
Nice.

5199
03:51:50,570 --> 03:51:51,850
Senita, thank you for the super chat.

5200
03:51:51,930 --> 03:51:52,170
Thank you.

5201
03:51:52,190 --> 03:51:52,610
Thank you.

5202
03:51:52,610 --> 03:51:56,190
I can't afford 30 minutes but here's my part to turn yourself in.

5203
03:51:56,390 --> 03:51:57,950
Thank you for the super chat.

5204
03:51:58,110 --> 03:51:58,570
Thank you.

5205
03:51:58,590 --> 03:51:59,290
Thank you.

5206
03:51:59,650 --> 03:52:01,470
Oh, I can upgrade my vehicle.

5207
03:52:02,570 --> 03:52:03,290
Oh, wait.

5208
03:52:03,350 --> 03:52:03,830
Might as well.

5209
03:52:03,910 --> 03:52:04,170
You know?

5210
03:52:07,890 --> 03:52:08,430
Oh, okay.

5211
03:52:08,490 --> 03:52:09,890
We gotta get chip slot, guys.

5212
03:52:10,090 --> 03:52:10,430
Okay.

5213
03:52:10,450 --> 03:52:11,010
And then...

5214
03:52:11,010 --> 03:52:12,450
Get that level 2.

5215
03:52:12,710 --> 03:52:14,130
And get that level 3.

5216
03:52:14,450 --> 03:52:16,290
And I might as well get that level 4.

5217
03:52:17,170 --> 03:52:18,830
Wait, how much can I do?

5218
03:52:19,070 --> 03:52:19,590
Oh, okay.

5219
03:52:20,030 --> 03:52:20,690
Level 5.

5220
03:52:20,850 --> 03:52:21,830
Just fall in.

5221
03:52:23,450 --> 03:52:25,450
God, my tank is so tanky now.

5222
03:52:28,600 --> 03:52:29,780
Okay, I only have one.

5223
03:52:30,660 --> 03:52:31,060
You're clear.

5224
03:52:32,020 --> 03:52:33,140
Dragon, thank you for the super chat.

5225
03:52:33,180 --> 03:52:33,400
Thank you.

5226
03:52:33,520 --> 03:52:33,760
Thank you.

5227
03:52:33,760 --> 03:52:34,900
What do you call an old snowman?

5228
03:52:35,060 --> 03:52:36,000
A glass of water.

5229
03:52:36,160 --> 03:52:37,160
Thank you for the super chat.

5230
03:52:37,220 --> 03:52:37,480
Thank you.

5231
03:52:37,500 --> 03:52:37,980
Thank you.

5232
03:52:38,280 --> 03:52:39,340
Alright, let's see.

5233
03:52:40,300 --> 03:52:41,940
I can finally add a chip.

5234
03:52:41,940 --> 03:52:43,700
Okay, power chip.

5235
03:52:43,780 --> 03:52:44,700
Quick reload.

5236
03:52:44,960 --> 03:52:46,660
Power plus chip.

5237
03:52:46,700 --> 03:52:47,920
Okay, we gotta get the cannon.

5238
03:52:48,120 --> 03:52:50,540
The cannon has been like the life saver.

5239
03:52:51,680 --> 03:52:52,580
Alright, nice.

5240
03:52:53,220 --> 03:52:55,240
How do I decorate my village?

5241
03:52:58,080 --> 03:53:01,200
Our only hope is to find that spring as soon as we can.

5242
03:53:02,160 --> 03:53:04,780
Let's abandon the tank and forget all about this.

5243
03:53:05,020 --> 03:53:05,960
We got lucky.

5244
03:53:06,100 --> 03:53:08,360
They still don't know who we really are.

5245
03:53:09,340 --> 03:53:11,080
Some demon you are, thief.

5246
03:53:11,080 --> 03:53:12,880
Don't be such a coward.

5247
03:53:14,180 --> 03:53:15,060
But, Prince...

5248
03:53:15,640 --> 03:53:18,300
I'll keep looking for the spring all on my own if I have to.

5249
03:53:18,440 --> 03:53:20,820
Look, you chose this guy to join us.

5250
03:53:20,920 --> 03:53:22,780
We could have got the cool centaur.

5251
03:53:23,200 --> 03:53:23,660
I'll come too.

5252
03:53:24,280 --> 03:53:25,780
We're basically partners in crime.

5253
03:53:25,840 --> 03:53:27,180
I wanted a centaur.

5254
03:53:27,980 --> 03:53:29,200
Let me be clear.

5255
03:53:29,580 --> 03:53:32,780
I'm not turning back until I've seen that spring with my own eyes.

5256
03:53:33,420 --> 03:53:36,320
If you can't handle that, then go home already.

5257
03:53:37,840 --> 03:53:38,280
But...

5258
03:53:39,640 --> 03:53:42,960
What will everyone say if they see me return without you?

5259
03:53:44,600 --> 03:53:46,160
Don't be a worrywart, Grams.

5260
03:53:46,940 --> 03:53:48,540
I'm sure things will work out.

5261
03:53:48,980 --> 03:53:52,180
Once the jump bot's ready, I just know we'll find the spring.

5262
03:53:53,440 --> 03:53:55,100
How can you be so sure?

5263
03:53:56,200 --> 03:53:58,320
You're a gutsy one, aren't you?

5264
03:54:01,740 --> 03:54:02,480
Oh, what?

5265
03:54:02,700 --> 03:54:03,880
We're out of town now?

5266
03:54:04,800 --> 03:54:06,160
Where's our... where's the woman?

5267
03:54:06,500 --> 03:54:09,500
Can Anne find working on that jump bot all on her own?

5268
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:12,120
We just... exactly!

5269
03:54:12,240 --> 03:54:15,360
I spent all my money upgrading the tank and now they want to abandon it?

5270
03:54:15,500 --> 03:54:16,240
What the fuck?

5271
03:54:16,360 --> 03:54:18,840
We're better off getting some rest for the journey ahead.

5272
03:54:22,480 --> 03:54:28,300
We're going to be aimlessly wandering through the southern desert with an entire army on our tail.

5273
03:54:29,860 --> 03:54:30,540
Don't worry.

5274
03:54:30,760 --> 03:54:32,660
I lived in the south thirty years ago.

5275
03:54:32,800 --> 03:54:35,340
So I at least know the general lay of the land there.

5276
03:54:38,460 --> 03:54:38,940
Ah.

5277
03:54:39,080 --> 03:54:39,540
Ah.

5278
03:54:39,540 --> 03:54:40,860
Thirty years ago?

5279
03:54:42,260 --> 03:54:46,000
You mean back when the Peechee still inhabited the area?

5280
03:54:46,580 --> 03:54:48,400
Oh, back when the aliens...

5281
03:54:48,400 --> 03:54:50,920
That would be about the time the royal army wiped them all out.

5282
03:54:50,920 --> 03:54:52,620
He was part of the massacre!

5283
03:54:53,300 --> 03:54:55,060
He's a bad old person!

5284
03:54:55,420 --> 03:54:56,680
We need to push him.

5285
03:54:57,940 --> 03:54:59,060
Such a tragedy.

5286
03:54:59,420 --> 03:55:03,380
That made my list of the top ten most foolish things...

5287
03:55:03,380 --> 03:55:04,340
Wait, what's number one?

5288
03:55:05,300 --> 03:55:07,040
...humanity has ever done?

5289
03:55:09,360 --> 03:55:09,800
Foolish.

5290
03:55:11,140 --> 03:55:15,660
But it prevented the Peechee from destroying all of Sandland with their doomsday weapon.

5291
03:55:15,820 --> 03:55:16,880
That a doomsday weapon?

5292
03:55:18,800 --> 03:55:19,240
Really?

5293
03:55:19,240 --> 03:55:20,840
You actually believe that?

5294
03:55:21,880 --> 03:55:24,080
Aster, thank you for the magenta soup pot!

5295
03:55:24,100 --> 03:55:24,360
Thank you!

5296
03:55:24,820 --> 03:55:27,620
Hey Doki, I've been loving the streams I've been able to catch.

5297
03:55:27,800 --> 03:55:30,200
Also super excited for the rob the bank merch to ship.

5298
03:55:30,280 --> 03:55:30,600
Thank you!

5299
03:55:30,800 --> 03:55:34,240
We might be able to ship it beginning of next month.

5300
03:55:34,240 --> 03:55:35,140
So I'm super excited.

5301
03:55:36,380 --> 03:55:37,020
Peechee, we're really developing a machine that makes water.

5302
03:55:37,020 --> 03:55:38,480
Oh my god!

5303
03:55:38,600 --> 03:55:40,640
He got influenced by propaganda!

5304
03:55:40,880 --> 03:55:42,560
He got propagandized!

5305
03:55:43,040 --> 03:55:43,520
What?

5306
03:55:44,200 --> 03:55:44,860
Water?

5307
03:55:45,180 --> 03:55:47,720
No, that can't be true.

5308
03:55:47,860 --> 03:55:48,200
Oh my god!

5309
03:55:48,240 --> 03:55:50,960
Are Peechee's like the Piccolo's in this universe?

5310
03:55:52,160 --> 03:55:53,360
It's true alright.

5311
03:55:53,720 --> 03:55:55,180
The brilliant Peechee...

5312
03:55:55,180 --> 03:55:58,200
I forgot the name of their species.

5313
03:55:58,560 --> 03:55:59,740
The something.

5314
03:56:00,180 --> 03:56:01,360
It starts with an N, right?

5315
03:56:02,300 --> 03:56:05,680
Not just for themselves but to share with everyone.

5316
03:56:07,100 --> 03:56:08,060
That's a Deadpool!

5317
03:56:08,320 --> 03:56:09,120
Thank you for the farm!

5318
03:56:09,220 --> 03:56:10,000
Get the chips!

5319
03:56:10,060 --> 03:56:10,280
Thank you!

5320
03:56:10,810 --> 03:56:16,180
Get the... Namikil... Namik... Namik... N... N... N... something.

5321
03:56:16,900 --> 03:56:17,520
Namikil...

5322
03:56:17,520 --> 03:56:22,580
Because the Royal Army's profits would go up in smoke if that happened.

5323
03:56:23,500 --> 03:56:25,860
They got rid of the Peechee first.

5324
03:56:27,800 --> 03:56:34,440
The massive explosion that happened when they were attacked was caused by the aquarium they needed to make their machine work.

5325
03:56:35,440 --> 03:56:39,120
Which the Royal Army gave them knowing what would happen.

5326
03:56:39,720 --> 03:56:47,980
And the Royal Army used a massive aquarium bomb to wipe out every last one of them.

5327
03:56:50,060 --> 03:56:51,500
No... but...

5328
03:56:51,500 --> 03:56:55,720
This is when he realized how badly he fucked up.

5329
03:56:55,980 --> 03:57:01,420
Before then he was like, okay I was just doing my orders and it can't be that bad.

5330
03:57:01,580 --> 03:57:04,420
Now he realized everything he did.

5331
03:57:04,420 --> 03:57:05,680
He doomed humanity.

5332
03:57:06,320 --> 03:57:09,140
The commander of the tank brigade that attacked them.

5333
03:57:09,220 --> 03:57:11,380
Who ordered the shots that set off the aquarium.

5334
03:57:12,380 --> 03:57:14,160
Was it you, Sheriff?

5335
03:57:15,080 --> 03:57:17,060
It was you, wasn't it?

5336
03:57:17,260 --> 03:57:17,420
It was me.

5337
03:57:17,600 --> 03:57:18,760
I knew it!

5338
03:57:18,880 --> 03:57:21,400
Okay, we like sort of called this in like...

5339
03:57:23,180 --> 03:57:26,920
We literally... we're like, bro, he obviously used to be from the army.

5340
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:28,880
Resulting explosion.

5341
03:57:30,040 --> 03:57:32,980
Destroyed almost my entire village.

5342
03:57:34,420 --> 03:57:39,520
And everyone in my whole brigade, apart from me, was killed in an instant.

5343
03:57:39,760 --> 03:57:41,120
Guys, I wrote this game.

5344
03:57:42,760 --> 03:57:44,720
I ghost wrote this game, guys.

5345
03:57:48,380 --> 03:57:50,140
They made us attack.

5346
03:57:50,440 --> 03:57:52,080
Now he has more trauma.

5347
03:57:52,420 --> 03:57:53,060
That explosion.

5348
03:57:54,680 --> 03:57:55,280
Wait.

5349
03:57:55,280 --> 03:57:59,760
If they knew, why would they make your tanks attack inside the blast radius?

5350
03:58:01,980 --> 03:58:04,400
Bro, stop spoiling the game, dokey.

5351
03:58:06,300 --> 03:58:09,280
Our brigade never much like supreme commanders.

5352
03:58:09,320 --> 03:58:10,000
They use methods.

5353
03:58:10,260 --> 03:58:12,260
We spoke our minds too much.

5354
03:58:15,320 --> 03:58:19,200
Oh, well, not your fault, huh?

5355
03:58:19,580 --> 03:58:22,860
You had no idea.

5356
03:58:25,080 --> 03:58:26,980
He still killed people.

5357
03:58:28,520 --> 03:58:33,600
He still... bro, he literally wiped out an entire race.

5358
03:58:33,600 --> 03:58:36,840
You can't just be like, he was just following orders.

5359
03:58:37,000 --> 03:58:43,280
He knew what... he still... the context of wiping the entire race just changed.

5360
03:58:44,640 --> 03:58:46,760
He still did it.

5361
03:58:47,040 --> 03:58:47,560
Like...

5362
03:58:53,880 --> 03:59:01,180
Like, he still... like, it just changed the context of him wiping... the reasoning why he wiped the entire race.

5363
03:59:08,720 --> 03:59:09,620
But then...

5364
03:59:10,660 --> 03:59:11,760
The P.G.

5365
03:59:11,780 --> 03:59:15,180
were really developing a machine that made water.

5366
03:59:16,400 --> 03:59:18,940
The real fiend here...

5367
03:59:18,940 --> 03:59:20,200
It's you.

5368
03:59:20,840 --> 03:59:21,780
And the royal army...

5369
03:59:21,780 --> 03:59:22,940
Wait, he murders!

5370
03:59:23,380 --> 03:59:24,100
A massive...

5371
03:59:24,100 --> 03:59:25,960
He actually murders!

5372
03:59:26,920 --> 03:59:28,760
...the very last one of them.

5373
03:59:28,840 --> 03:59:29,460
Bro!

5374
03:59:29,940 --> 03:59:33,560
The demons can't even kill, but he can!

5375
03:59:34,180 --> 03:59:34,620
It's actually me.

5376
03:59:39,970 --> 03:59:40,170
Hm?

5377
03:59:45,840 --> 03:59:47,180
What the fuck is he doing?

5378
03:59:49,220 --> 03:59:50,180
Give me a sec.

5379
03:59:50,340 --> 03:59:52,720
I'm gonna turn into a giant monkey right now.

5380
03:59:53,660 --> 03:59:55,580
Sorry, wrong... wrong manga.

5381
03:59:59,100 --> 04:00:00,740
What in the world?

5382
04:00:01,220 --> 04:00:02,600
The Toriyama...

5383
04:00:02,600 --> 04:00:03,720
I'm absorbing the power of death.

5384
04:00:03,720 --> 04:00:04,460
...cinematic universe.

5385
04:00:05,240 --> 04:00:08,360
Because it looks... like we're in for a fight.

5386
04:00:23,960 --> 04:00:25,520
Guys, my game crashed.

5387
04:00:31,350 --> 04:00:34,010
Okay, I think that's a good time to call it.

5388
04:00:37,010 --> 04:00:39,030
Okay, I'm gonna call it here.

5389
04:00:40,230 --> 04:00:41,910
I mean, we had a lot...

5390
04:00:42,930 --> 04:00:44,410
We played for...

5391
04:00:45,510 --> 04:00:47,110
We played for four hours.

5392
04:00:47,530 --> 04:00:48,450
Did it save?

5393
04:00:48,650 --> 04:00:51,090
Well, it has auto-save, so I think we'll be fine.

5394
04:00:51,410 --> 04:00:53,210
Honestly, I've been enjoying it so far.

5395
04:00:53,450 --> 04:00:54,030
I don't know...

5396
04:00:54,030 --> 04:00:55,330
Let's see how long this game is.

5397
04:00:55,390 --> 04:00:55,850
Let me see.

5398
04:00:56,150 --> 04:00:56,590
Sun...

5399
04:00:56,590 --> 04:00:57,410
Land...

5400
04:00:57,410 --> 04:00:57,630
Earth...

5401
04:00:57,630 --> 04:00:59,910
How long is the game?

5402
04:01:00,070 --> 04:01:00,790
Let me look it up.

5403
04:01:00,890 --> 04:01:02,190
How long is Sand Land?

5404
04:01:02,530 --> 04:01:05,950
It took me 32 hours to finish Sand Land!

5405
04:01:06,890 --> 04:01:07,830
Oh my god.

5406
04:01:07,930 --> 04:01:08,250
Okay.

5407
04:01:08,850 --> 04:01:09,290
Um...

5408
04:01:10,610 --> 04:01:11,730
I'll think about it.

5409
04:01:16,130 --> 04:01:17,010
25 hours...

5410
04:01:17,010 --> 04:01:17,190
Okay.

5411
04:01:17,930 --> 04:01:19,410
Okay, I'm gonna think about it, guys.

5412
04:01:19,490 --> 04:01:21,150
I'm not gonna give you guys any promises.

5413
04:01:21,530 --> 04:01:22,650
If there's a cut to...

5414
04:01:22,650 --> 04:01:24,470
If there's a part two, there's a part two.

5415
04:01:24,530 --> 04:01:27,610
If you never see a part two again, you know what I mean.

5416
04:01:32,870 --> 04:01:33,350
Okay.

5417
04:01:33,670 --> 04:01:35,170
I'll think about it, guys.

5418
04:01:35,310 --> 04:01:36,730
I'm gonna think about it, chat.

5419
04:01:37,930 --> 04:01:38,410
Well...

5420
04:01:38,410 --> 04:01:39,270
We'll...

5421
04:01:39,830 --> 04:01:40,310
We'll...

5422
04:01:40,310 --> 04:01:40,330
We'll...

5423
04:01:40,330 --> 04:01:40,350
We'll...

5424
04:01:40,350 --> 04:01:41,590
I had fun, though.

5425
04:01:41,810 --> 04:01:43,850
I had a lot of fun, though, chat.

5426
04:01:44,050 --> 04:01:45,470
This has been, like, pretty enjoyable.

5427
04:01:45,710 --> 04:01:48,430
Like, the action RPG part.

5428
04:01:49,130 --> 04:01:49,610
Um...

5429
04:01:50,390 --> 04:01:54,370
But, I'll definitely think about it, guys, if we'll do a part two.

5430
04:01:54,890 --> 04:01:57,610
But I definitely enjoy it a lot so far.

5431
04:01:57,610 --> 04:02:00,370
So far, um, what's the spon- no, no, it wasn't sponsored.

5432
04:02:00,510 --> 04:02:15,050
I just really want to check it out on launch after, like, uh, it was like, um, you know, post- I can't, I can't, I don't want to- I don't want to- post-humously released after Tori- you know, after Toriyama- what happened to Toriyama.

5433
04:02:15,250 --> 04:02:22,310
And I really want to check it out because I talked about this before, but I grew up- my- my uncle was a huge Toriyama fan.

5434
04:02:22,310 --> 04:02:25,770
And, like, he owned, like, a lot- like, everything.

5435
04:02:25,930 --> 04:02:27,470
He owned, like, all his manga.

5436
04:02:27,610 --> 04:02:29,790
Like, all the manga that he ever wrote.

5437
04:02:30,030 --> 04:02:37,490
And, like, uh, I think, like, one of my- I remember- I remember one of my favorite one-shots that he did was, uh, I think it's called Kajika.

5438
04:02:38,230 --> 04:02:40,270
And, like, he owned everything.

5439
04:02:40,670 --> 04:02:45,350
And then, uh, like, it wasn't just, like, Dragon Ball Z or Dragon Ball or, like, Dr. Sub.

5440
04:02:45,530 --> 04:02:51,630
Every single one-shot that was published, um, my uncle owned- owned all of them.

5441
04:02:51,630 --> 04:02:58,170
Um, and I would, like, hang out in his room reading all the manga- like, all of his manga and stuff.

5442
04:02:58,370 --> 04:03:16,750
And I thought, like, oh, I really wanted to, you know- I, uh, really wanted to, um, check out this game as, like, uh, you know, like, uh- because I never really played, uh, uh, I guess, like, a Toriyama game on PC before.

5443
04:03:16,990 --> 04:03:25,810
Um, the last time I played a game based off of any of Toriyama's works was- um, the Dragon Ball Z game on the Game Boy Advance.

5444
04:03:26,130 --> 04:03:33,850
And that was, like, the only time I've ever played a, uh, one of his, uh, one of his, like, works being adapted into a video game.

5445
04:03:34,030 --> 04:03:37,830
I never even, like, played any of, like, the, you know, like, the Dragon Ball Z, like, fighter games.

5446
04:03:37,950 --> 04:03:39,450
I never played any of those on PC.

5447
04:03:39,830 --> 04:03:44,090
So, I figured, like, oh, you know, it's a good time to check it out.

5448
04:03:44,950 --> 04:03:48,050
Uh, and it- I- it was pretty enjoyable so far.

5449
04:03:48,450 --> 04:03:52,950
I've had a great time checking out- uh, checking out Sand Land.

5450
04:03:53,150 --> 04:03:55,570
It was really cool that Bandai dropped by.

5451
04:03:55,890 --> 04:03:57,510
I- I was like, oh my god!

5452
04:03:57,950 --> 04:03:59,130
They noticed me!

5453
04:03:59,470 --> 04:04:00,030
Guys!

5454
04:04:01,070 --> 04:04:02,550
Bandai noticed me!

5455
04:04:02,990 --> 04:04:06,190
Dragon Qu- guys, of course I haven't played Dragon Quest.

5456
04:04:06,350 --> 04:04:10,190
I told you about me and JRPGs, guys.

5457
04:04:12,110 --> 04:04:18,010
I- I am- I usually- I am not, like- like, JRPGs are not my preference.

5458
04:04:18,310 --> 04:04:21,610
That's why when I saw Action JRPG, I was like, oh, I'm not gonna play that.

5459
04:04:21,610 --> 04:04:23,750
I was like, oh my god, I like Action.

5460
04:04:26,550 --> 04:04:28,250
I- I like Action.

5461
04:04:28,410 --> 04:04:30,790
So, um, I was like, that's for me.

5462
04:04:31,150 --> 04:04:33,990
So that's why I was like, okay, I'll check it out just because it's Action.

5463
04:04:37,390 --> 04:04:38,910
Anyway, guys, I'm gonna call it here.

5464
04:04:39,090 --> 04:04:39,890
Tomorrow's a rest day.

5465
04:04:40,070 --> 04:04:44,810
And then Saturday's sort of like a rest day because there's only, like, the- it's like Goodnight Dragoons on Saturday.

5466
04:04:45,210 --> 04:04:48,750
And, uh, but I hope you guys enjoyed today's stream, everybody.

5467
04:04:49,010 --> 04:04:50,750
I always have great time streaming for you guys.

5468
04:04:50,870 --> 04:04:51,470
As always.

5469
04:04:51,510 --> 04:04:51,590
I'm JRPG.

5470
04:04:51,590 --> 04:04:51,590
I'll see you guys next time.

5471
04:04:51,590 --> 04:04:51,590
Bye!

5472
04:04:51,590 --> 04:04:55,550
Everyone stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

5473
04:04:55,730 --> 04:04:59,350
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve it.

5474
04:04:59,470 --> 04:05:00,710
I'll see you guys next time, everybody.

5475
04:05:01,290 --> 04:05:02,310
Bye, guys.

5476
04:05:02,790 --> 04:05:03,270
Bye!

5477
04:05:05,490 --> 04:05:05,970
Oh

5478
04:05:54,280 --> 04:05:54,840
my god!

5479
04:05:54,920 --> 04:05:55,900
Secret ending!

5480
04:05:56,260 --> 04:06:01,540
I just got an email from- from one of the represent- bandai.

5481
04:06:01,580 --> 04:06:05,540
They want to send me a collector's edition of Sadland.

5482
04:06:06,200 --> 04:06:08,000
Guys, I'm getting free shit!

5483
04:06:08,380 --> 04:06:09,660
Okay, we're gonna do a part two.

5484
04:06:09,660 --> 04:06:10,300
Sadland.

5485
04:06:14,800 --> 04:06:17,740
They're like, thank you for streaming Sadland!

5486
04:06:17,900 --> 04:06:19,720
We will send you a collector- okay, we're good.

5487
04:06:19,780 --> 04:06:21,340
I guess I have to do a part two now.

5488
04:06:24,380 --> 04:06:25,120
Anyway, guys.

5489
04:06:25,300 --> 04:06:26,020
Bye for real.

5490
04:06:28,780 --> 04:06:30,000
Sorry, wrong screen.

5491
04:06:31,320 --> 04:06:32,980
I got so excited.
