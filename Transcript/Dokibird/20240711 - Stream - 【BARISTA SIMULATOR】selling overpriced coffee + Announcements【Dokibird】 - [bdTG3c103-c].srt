00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,490
Hello everybody!

2
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,970
Sorry, sorry that we were a little bit late today.

3
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,910
I sort of went into the Planet of the Apes rabbit hole.

4
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,390
I was reading up like... oh my god.

5
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,630
Oh, I died.

6
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,070
Okay.

7
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,950
What the fuck?

8
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:03,930
What happened?

9
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,530
What?

10
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,770
Okay.

11
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,350
Okay, Mike like fucking...

12
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,670
Okay, apparently did not like that.

13
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,810
Give me a sec.

14
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,270
I don't know what happened.

15
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,490
I just... it just crashed.

16
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,430
Okay, where is that?

17
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,250
That was... whoa.

18
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,410
That was awkward.

19
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,930
Maybe it's the quality.

20
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,910
Oh no, is this a fucking Bitcoin miner?

21
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,270
Is this a...

22
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,730
Oh no.

23
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,530
Is this a Bitcoin miner?

24
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:46,490
Alright, we're gonna... we're gonna... we're gonna see if it's a Bitcoin miner soon.

25
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:53,410
I put it... I put it on medium graphics to see if that'll fix it.

26
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,870
Don't worry.

27
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,650
I'll be back very soon.

28
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,330
Oh my god!

29
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,550
You know what sucks?

30
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,550
I worked so hard putting on my barista apron into coffee.

31
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,590
That's the worst part.

32
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:13,190
The fact that I spent... actually spent time putting on my uniform and then it just fucking crashes.

33
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,350
Oh, this is bullshit.

34
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,590
This is actually bullshit.

35
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,130
I have to put that shit back on.

36
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:18,670
Come on.

37
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,590
I have to put that shit back on.

38
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,730
Okay.

39
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,290
Give me a sec guys.

40
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,610
Grab my coffee order too.

41
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,570
Alright, there we go.

42
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,330
Okay.

43
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,450
Alright, let's try this again.

44
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,170
Alright.

45
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:36,950
That's a little awkward.

46
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,310
Is this it?

47
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,730
Why is it... why am I not... why am I not up on the screen?

48
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:41,670
Hello?

49
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,290
Oh, there I am.

50
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,310
Okay, give me a second.

51
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,210
I'm gonna put this back on.

52
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,170
I need...

53
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,650
Give me a sec.

54
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,530
I need to put this back on everybody.

55
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,850
Alright, let's see.

56
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,170
And then it was like right here.

57
00:05:59,210 --> 00:05:59,570
Alright.

58
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:00,810
I think that was it.

59
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:01,650
Alright, give me a sec.

60
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,990
I need to take off my... I need to take off my jacket.

61
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,690
I forgot.

62
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,650
I'm not supposed to wear a jacket when I'm at work.

63
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:07,670
Uh...

64
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,410
I can't wear my jacket when I'm at work.

65
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,830
My boss is gonna kill me.

66
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,010
I can't.

67
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,770
They're like... it's not appropriate attire apparently.

68
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,970
So I have to take it off.

69
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,290
Alright, there we go.

70
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,190
Okay.

71
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,090
There we go.

72
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,590
That was... I don't know what the fuck just happened there.

73
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,290
Holy shit.

74
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,410
I just crashed out of nowhere.

75
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,230
Alright.

76
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,750
Anyway, I'm back on my uniform again.

77
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,810
And I have my uniform again.

78
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,430
Uh... yeah.

79
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,590
Alright, there we go.

80
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,170
Alright!

81
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:38,890
Welcome!

82
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,250
Welcome back!

83
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,130
Don't worry.

84
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,450
The barista is back.

85
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,310
I'm ready to do my minimum wage job.

86
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,910
Oh... I gotta be grounded in reality.

87
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,250
I gotta know what it's like to have a minimum wage job again.

88
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,350
So I can appreciate you... I can appreciate people more.

89
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,250
Um...

90
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,250
I know!

91
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,590
Anyway, welcome.

92
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:04,570
Welcome guys.

93
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:09,950
Um... for those who don't know, I actually have two really big announcements.

94
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,830
Um... I have two really big announcements to make today.

95
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,730
But that will be at the end of the stream.

96
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,930
So you gotta watch me work my minimum wage job before...

97
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:27,810
You gotta wait until my shift is over before you can figure out what the announcements are.

98
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,130
You gotta...

99
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:35,270
You gotta wait until my shift is over.

100
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,070
I can't... guys, I can't announce when I'm working.

101
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,010
Guys... dragoons, I can't announce when I'm working, dragoons.

102
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,070
My boss isn't gonna like it!

103
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,930
Dude, he's gonna dock my tips!

104
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,050
He's gonna take my tips, guys!

105
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,230
You don't understand!

106
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,550
I work like four dollars and... wait, what's minimum...

107
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,790
I know they like... they increase minimum wage, but because of inflation...

108
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,190
I know they don't usually do that anymore because like, you know, society.

109
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,410
But like...

110
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,650
Not in Europe or Australia!

111
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,750
I know you guys get paid a lot better.

112
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:14,890
But like, in NA, they stopped really raising the minimum wage these days to account for inflation.

113
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,910
They sort of stopped doing that.

114
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,190
So like, I hope...

115
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,650
It's like eleven dollars?

116
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,710
Okay, it's eleven... okay, chat's dead.

117
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,870
Don't worry, I'll revive chat.

118
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,090
Chat, don't worry!

119
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,510
I have coffee, chat!

120
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,790
We're gonna feed you some coffee and then you're gonna be back to life!

121
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,830
Alright.

122
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,830
Pew!

123
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,210
And then...

124
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,870
Pew!

125
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,230
Okay, there we go.

126
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,370
Sorry, we're...

127
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,750
Today's a sort of special day for this announcement.

128
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,470
Um... but yes!

129
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,230
Welcome!

130
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,350
Welcome to Barista Simulator!

131
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:58,290
Um... you know, usually at like 12.30 PM streams, I usually find some... try to find some interesting games for 12.30.

132
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,190
They're usually called like one-off days.

133
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,830
Unless I'm trying to complete a long series.

134
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,590
12.30 PM is... tends to be like one-off streams.

135
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,210
Anyway, I thought this was really interesting.

136
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,190
I was reading the reviews and then some of them was like, this is stressful.

137
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,550
Ten out of ten.

138
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,210
I'm like, you know what?

139
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,510
I need more stress in my life.

140
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:26,430
It's not like I cried like yesterday because I was so stressed out.

141
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,150
You know what?

142
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,050
I think I need more stress.

143
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,450
I think I need...

144
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,850
I think I...

145
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,790
I think I need more of that.

146
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,490
Oh my God.

147
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,250
Anyway.

148
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,930
Um... apparently they're saying like, yeah, these coffee orders tend to get like super realistic.

149
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,750
So like, good luck.

150
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,110
And I'm like, yeah, alright.

151
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,290
I've never worked.

152
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,770
I honestly... I've never worked.

153
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,590
Um... as...

154
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,770
Well, I cried because like I needed to let it out.

155
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,550
It's not good.

156
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:01,330
It's not good to like have it all kept up inside you.

157
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,290
Like when you're really stressed out.

158
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,550
So I had like a nice cry because I was like, I needed to let it out.

159
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,330
And I was like...

160
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:12,570
And then I'm okay now.

161
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,390
I'm okay.

162
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,990
Because it's better... it's better than keeping it...

163
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,830
Oh my God.

164
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,630
My PC...

165
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,030
Why is my PC letting out so much hot air?

166
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,550
It's peris...

167
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,350
This is not well optimized.

168
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,330
This is not a well optimized game.

169
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,830
Holy shit.

170
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:30,750
I...

171
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,430
I just booted this game up.

172
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,110
What are you...

173
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,810
All that is a Bitcoin miner.

174
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:46,850
This is definitely mining some crypto right now for somebody in Europe.

175
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:51,910
Anyway.

176
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:55,450
I'm giving some people some PTSD right now.

177
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,690
Wearing my barista uniform.

178
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,350
And playing this game.

179
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,430
But you know what?

180
00:10:59,550 --> 00:10:59,870
Let's...

181
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:00,230
Let's try.

182
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,310
I've never been a barista before.

183
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,130
I've never...

184
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,310
I've never done...

185
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,730
I've never been...

186
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,350
Worked as a barista before.

187
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,350
So like this will be interesting.

188
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,150
I worked as...

189
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,330
You know why I did similar?

190
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,990
I worked as an unpaid family member at a restaurant.

191
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,630
You know like...

192
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,090
You know it's like family owned restaurants.

193
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,190
And then you worked as an unpaid labor.

194
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,530
Because you're family.

195
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,030
That's what I did.

196
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,750
So it's practically the same thing.

197
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:33,610
Instead...

198
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,650
Instead I just didn't get paid.

199
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,950
I didn't get paid.

200
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,030
I got some free bubble tea.

201
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:39,830
At least.

202
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,510
My game crashed.

203
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,370
I think it's barista simulator.

204
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,030
I think...

205
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,030
Holy shit.

206
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,560
Okay let me like...

207
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,160
Let me put it as like the lowest graphics possible.

208
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,440
I think we gotta put this as the...

209
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,380
The lowest...

210
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,280
Lowest graphics possible for this game.

211
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,200
I don't think this game is meant to be played at all.

212
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,020
Alright.

213
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,900
Woah.

214
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,280
That changed a lot.

215
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,700
Oh my god.

216
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,700
We don't need shadows guys.

217
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,140
Okay maybe not like very low.

218
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,160
Maybe just regular low.

219
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,120
Alright.

220
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,140
Maybe regular low should be okay.

221
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,320
Um...

222
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,500
I can't believe it.

223
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,960
This PC has a 4080 I think.

224
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,660
Or 90.

225
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,300
Anyway.

226
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,600
Guys, anyway.

227
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,220
If you guys wanna know what the announcements are.

228
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,180
They're pretty big announcements.

229
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
One will be about what the special stream is tomorrow.

230
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,980
And the other one is something else.

231
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,380
So um...

232
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,020
You guys wanna know what it is?

233
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,620
You gotta wait until my shift is over guys.

234
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,840
Gladstone.

235
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,600
Thank you for the super chat.

236
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:46,900
Thank you.

237
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,440
Thank you.

238
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,040
You reckon I can get this maid to sing me a happy birthday?

239
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,240
Also what was that about plan dapes you were gonna say?

240
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,800
Thank you for the super chat Gladstone.

241
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,140
Thank you.

242
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,720
Thank you.

243
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,100
Of course.

244
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,360
Gladstone.

245
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,000
Happy birthday to you.

246
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,860
Happy birthday to you.

247
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,920
Happy birthday dear Glatzone.

248
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,340
Happy birthday to you.

249
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:03,760
Yeah!

250
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,440
Thank you for the super chat.

251
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:06,780
Thank you.

252
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,240
Thank you.

253
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,620
Anyway, the reason why I was late was because I was in the rabbit hole regarding Planet of the Apes lore.

254
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,800
So like...

255
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:24,340
I was reading... I was reading up about Planet of the Apes because recently I was watching... I watched the Kingdom of the Apes and like I'm... okay.

256
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,120
This is like spoiler.

257
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,180
This is like a spoiler.

258
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,040
But like I was like, okay.

259
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,140
Okay.

260
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,900
There was this particular scene where they surrounded the evil main character.

261
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,440
It was... this is the ending and it was like this particular scene where they surrounded this evil main character and then like...

262
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,840
and then like... okay.

263
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,180
And then like the thing is they could just push him.

264
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Because they were at the cliff.

265
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,920
They could have just pushed him.

266
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,500
There was like... like 20 of them.

267
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,020
So like 20 plus.

268
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,340
So I couldn't understand like why they just like... were like, oh no this one guy.

269
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,540
It's just one guy!

270
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,820
Push him!

271
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,220
And I couldn't understand!

272
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Like they had to go instead they like called out for the birds to like use the birds to push him.

273
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,520
So like I was just like what... why?

274
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,080
There's at least 30 of you!

275
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,600
What happened to apes together strong?

276
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,360
It's not birds together strong.

277
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,820
It's apes together strong.

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,780
So I was like incredibly confused about that.

279
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,060
Anyway, I started looking up.

280
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:54,880
Sorry that wasn't like... that has nothing to do regardless.

281
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,680
Regarding the rabbit hole of the kingdom of the hearts.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,220
Sorry not kingdom of the hearts.

283
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,400
Sorry I'm not talking about kingdom.

284
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,700
Kingdom of the apes.

285
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,620
It has nothing to do regarding why I was in the rabbit hole.

286
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,720
But I just had to talk about the ending of that movie.

287
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,620
Because that made zero sense for me.

288
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,740
I was just like push him!

289
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,300
It's one guy!

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,340
It doesn't matter!

291
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,720
Anyway...

292
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,460
Um...

293
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,800
Anyway sorry.

294
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,460
Anyway.

295
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,860
I was like really curious about the lore of like...

296
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,340
Uh...

297
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,940
The lore about like...

298
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:30,580
Uh...

299
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,700
Planet of the apes and everything regarding the newest series.

300
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,520
So I was like reading up like each character.

301
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,160
And like getting to know about like...

302
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,080
Like the society of the plat...

303
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,480
Also like I don't know if you guys remember but like...

304
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,000
The... not the original but the reboot of the planet of the apes was like...

305
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,500
Was it...

306
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,820
14 years ago?

307
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh my god.

308
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,820
Why is this game crashing?

309
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh my god!

310
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,960
Okay maybe it's because I'm not playing the game.

311
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,940
So then the game boots me up because I'm not playing the game.

312
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,500
But yeah.

313
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,420
The planet of the apes...

314
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:11,220
The reboot of the movie released like...

315
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,880
Oh my god it released in 2011.

316
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,560
It was like 2011.

317
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,300
Did you guys know that Andy Serkis is like...

318
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,880
Almost 70 now?

319
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,480
He's like...

320
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,040
Okay how old is Andy Serkis?

321
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,600
Um...

322
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,160
He's like...

323
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,460
Oh he's 60 years old now.

324
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,200
And I was like...

325
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:28,820
Oh my god.

326
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,120
He's 60 years old!

327
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,700
Yeah!

328
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,240
Holy shit!

329
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,320
He's 60 years old!

330
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,780
That's the guy that does all the...

331
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,560
Atomos like...

332
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,120
Atomos like 3D shit.

333
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,060
Like you know like Gollum and everything.

334
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,260
And he always does like the tracking.

335
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,720
The 3D tracking for like...

336
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,300
Like shit that moves weird.

337
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:54,620
Like...

338
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,720
Yeah...

339
00:16:59,720 --> 00:16:59,820
I was like...

340
00:16:59,820 --> 00:16:59,880
Um...

341
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,260
But...

342
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:01,380
Yeah.

343
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,000
I was like...

344
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,680
So surprised.

345
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,640
I was like...

346
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,160
Oh my god.

347
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,300
Planet of the apes is like...

348
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,120
2011.

349
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,580
There's...

350
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,140
Oh my god.

351
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,060
Speaking of 2011.

352
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,680
Somebody in my...

353
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,260
Okay.

354
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,340
During like...

355
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,400
Okay so like...

356
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,880
Um...

357
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,420
During Anime Expo...

358
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,020
During Anime Expo...

359
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,620
Uh...

360
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:20,660
Uh...

361
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,740
Yusong sang a song...

362
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,340
That I...

363
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,000
I sang an anime song and it was apparently a Boomer anime song.

364
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,700
But like I didn't like that's what like that's what they said.

365
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:34,660
They were like I'm gonna sing a Boomer anime song and I didn't really know what it's from.

366
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,880
Because like I have very little knowledge of anime in general.

367
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:47,040
So then I was like haha Boomer you're old and then like and then so because I didn't really know what the song was in general.

368
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,880
I was just like hee hee it's a Boomer song and I still don't I don't remember what song it was again.

369
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,920

And then somebody like tweeted at us and was like that's not old.

372
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,700
The show came out in 2010.

373
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:19,500

Like I didn't name them out specifically.

377

You would do homemade coffee.

548
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,600

00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,560
I don't understand.

738
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,680
Why would you need it?

739
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,640
In fact, like it?

740
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,420
What do you mean?

741
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,340
Toki?

742
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:32,740
I'm just saying like wouldn't it work if how do I empty the knockbox?

743
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,620
Is this the knockbox?

744
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,180
Am I holding the knockbox?

745
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,740
No, I'm not.

746
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,120
Okay.

747
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,080
I'm putting it back in.

748
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,160
Okay, the knockbox.

749
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,860
What the fuck is a knockbox?

750
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,200
What is that?

751
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,520
What is this?

752
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,320
What's a knockbox?

753
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,500
Guys, what what is this?

754
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:03,420
Uh, what's the knockbox?

755
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,980
I don't understand.

756
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,060
Empty it.

757
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,020
How do I empty it?

758
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,480
Empty the knockbox.

759
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,440
How do I?

760
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,360
How do I empty this?

761
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,100
Toss.

762
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:17,360
Oh.

763
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,460
Do I toss it in here?

764
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,540
Oh.

765
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:31,860
But like I can just I should just be able to toss a little bit and then like keep some of it in to enhance the flavor.

766
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,160
Guys, you can tell I never made coffee before.

767
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,520
Guys, can you tell this is my first time?

768
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,580
I usually don't order coffee.

769
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,780
I usually order a...

770
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,500
Usually, I usually...

771
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,600
I order like...

772
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,940
London Fog or like I just drink canned coffee.

773
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,580
If I order like a coffee order, it's usually a latte.

774
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,240
Let's see.

775
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
Look at the coffee recipe.

776
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,900
There's a coffee.

777
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,900
I need to know the coffee recipe.

778
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,120
Oh my God.

779
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:08,820
What do you mean?

780
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,740
I need to know the coffee recipe.

781
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,260
Holy shit.

782
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
You know how London Fog is so easy to make?

783
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,720
You just get like Earl Grey and then you put like vanilla extract.

784
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,940
That's London Fog.

785
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,920
That's literally it.

786
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,080
Oh my God.

787
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:30,700
Okay.

788
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:35,160
Espresso is very intense and espresso based.

789
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,560
Okay, that's that's alright.

790
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,640
That seems doable.

791
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:43,300
The name means double Italian refers to a double shot for two espresso shot.

792
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,020
Okay.

793
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,400
I'm going to...

794
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,600
I...

795
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,620
What's the difference?

796
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:50,860
What?

797
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:51,980
What's...

798
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,200
What's the difference?

799
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,920
It's just more coffee beans, right?

800
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,780
Yeah, it's 90, 60.

801
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,800
Okay, I can do this.

802
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,540
Alright.

803
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, I can go home now.

804
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:05,720
One or...

805
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,820
We're one and done.

806
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,400
Family!

807
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,060
I'm home!

808
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,260
I made $10!

809
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,380
Family!

810
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,820
Family!

811
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,320
Look at that!

812
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:18,800
Dragons!

813
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,420
I made $10 today!

814
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,020
Are you guys proud of me?

815
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,640
$500?!

816
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Oh my God!

817
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:34,200
Guys, I got a $490 tip from Liberty.

818
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,200
I told you she had nothing to do with her life.

819
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:37,920
I...

820
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,080
I fucking knew it.

821
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,280
I knew she had nothing to do with her life.

822
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,780
If she came to this coffee shop.

823
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,460
Hello?

824
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,060
What would you like, sir?

825
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,320
Edwin!

826
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,580
You want a mini triplo?

827
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,740
I got you, sir.

828
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,380
How do I...

829
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,660
Say yes.

830
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,760
Okay, mini triplo.

831
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,240
Okay.

832
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,000
What's your name?

833
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,440
Edwin.

834
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,420
Okay, Edwin.

835
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,840
Um...

836
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,920
Okay.

837
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,500
Uh...

838
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,600
I would like one red super for this.

839
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,340
Alright.

840
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,200
We're gonna charge him $100, guys.

841
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,600
Okay, and then we're gonna put this here.

842
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,440
And then...

843
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,780
Wait.

844
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,740
I don't...

845
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,440
Oh, there it is.

846
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,180
Okay.

847
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,540
I pick it up.

848
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,160
I grind it.

849
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,500
Put it all the way up.

850
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,780
Grind, grind, grind.

851
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,320
Alright.

852
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,660
Grind, grind, grind.

853
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,820
And then I put it in...

854
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,000
How do I fill it up?

855
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,160
Okay, I've...

856
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,060
I've picked this up.

857
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,940
And then I...

858
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,100
Put it down.

859
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,620
And then I pick this up.

860
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,320
And I fill it up.

861
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Is that...

862
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,260
Is that enough?

863
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,580
What was it?

864
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,800
Uh...

865
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,340
Triplo.

866
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,880
Is triplo like...

867
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,760
What was triplo again?

868
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,100
Triplo is...

869
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:07,700
Triplo.

870
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,020
It is 90 milliliters.

871
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Oh my god.

872
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,840
What the fuck are you doing with your life?

873
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,720
Alright.

874
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,140
I'm gonna...

875
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,260
Okay.

876
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,460
And then I put it in.

877
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,120
Set the dosage as double shot.

878
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,800
Produce 60 milliliters instead of 30.

879
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,680
Oh, but I need like...

880
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,140
Three.

881
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,020
So that means I need like...

882
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,160
I need like...

883
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,560
I need to do like two shots plus one.

884
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:33,800
Okay.

885
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,340
And then...

886
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,040
Go.

887
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:38,960
Alright.

888
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,600
And I have to do another one.

889
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,780
Two plus one.

890
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,100
Guys, I'm doing it!

891
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,880
I'm running my own coffee shop!

892
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,280
Okay.

893
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,420
Hey, Edwin.

894
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,680
I know you also have nothing to do with your life.

895
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,080
You a trust fund kid, Edwin?

896
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,060
Cause why the fuck are you here?

897
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:03,920
Alright.

898
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,620
Guys, why does this take so long?

899
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,760
Does it usually take this long to make coffee?

900
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,670
Look at how excited he is for his coffee.

901
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:14,650
Yeah, he's so excited.

902
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,930
He's so exci- Oh, affiliate!

903
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,430
Thank you for the 10 gifted chips!

904
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,830
Thank you!

905
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,870
I really appreciate it.

906
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:21,270
Thank you.

907
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,330
You can't say he really likes his coffee.

908
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:27,530
If he really likes his coffee, he would not be in this store.

909
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,490
He would not.

910
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,570
He would not be here buying my coffee.

911
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,590
Cause I bought the cheapest brand at Walmart.

912
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,950
I bought the cheapest coffee beans at Walmart.

913
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:42,850
Alright.

914
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,090
And then...

915
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:44,630
I'm gonna go to the next one.

916
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,970
Let me fill it up.

917
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,230
That's like 60.

918
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:52,090
This is just one caffeine?

919
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,950
Is that really all you want?

920
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,730
Is it...

921
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,710
Oh, I have to do it again?

922
00:39:58,350 --> 00:39:59,350
Holy shit!

923
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,750
What?

924
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,290
Okay, and then I put it in the knock box.

925
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:07,050
And then I have to grind it up again.

926
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,710
And...

927
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,510
You have to make another one.

928
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,970
Oh my god.

929
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,530
This is just a service.

930
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,010
I know the people at my coffee shop...

931
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,590
I know people at Tim Hortons does not do this.

932
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:33,710
The staff members at Tim Hortons does not do as much as I'm doing right now.

933
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,790
No!

934
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:35,970
Edwin!

935
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,650
Did you not like my story?

936
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:41,390
Edwin!

937
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,390
I can't do this fast!

938
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,830
You want a triple!

939
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:48,630
Okay, she wants to...

940
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,410
Oh my gosh.

941
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,630
Lucky for you.

942
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,190
Lucky for you.

943
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:54,370
Um...

944
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:54,950
I...

945
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,470
I got...

946
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,890
I got a drink for you.

947
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,470
Ms. Gurtu.

948
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,930
I can't do this faster!

949
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,610
What do you mean?

950
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,730
I can't do this!

951
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,370
I need somebody else to help me!

952
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,470
He wants to grind the coffee beans for me!

953
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:29,050
You had... Edwin had nothing to do in his life!

954
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:30,710
I can't believe it!

955
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:33,470
I can't believe he would just leave!

956
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,250
Alright, there you go.

957
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:38,670
Here you go, here's your coffee.

958
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,690
Is it not what you want?

959
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,170
That's a mini triplo!

960
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,230
Oh, I have to ring the bell.

961
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,070
Yay!

962
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,590
At least somebody's out.

963
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:48,770
Holy shit!

964
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,490
That was $140!

965
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,730
Can I like hire staff?

966
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:57,630
Cafe, to hire a barista, I need a level 2 store.

967
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,390
Where do I get to level 2?

968
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,790
Oh, I'm almost there!

969
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,390
I need to hire a barista!

970
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,170
I don't want to be a barista anymore!

971
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,910
I don't want to be a barista!

972
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,470
You also want a triplo?!

973
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,370
Oh my god!

974
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,690
I should have been grinding coffee since the beginning!

975
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,970
You need fresh?

976
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:20,170
Is there not 60 in there?

977
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,670
Oh my god, okay.

978
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,430
Alright, I'm...

979
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,910
Fucking Oscar is not getting his coffee.

980
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,830
That's for sure.

981
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:35,250
Alright, I just want to be an owner.

982
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,290
I just want to be a coffee shop owner.

983
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,470
I don't want to be...

984
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,850
I don't want to do the hard work anymore.

985
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:42,850
Yes!

986
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,390
What is that?

987
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:49,110
Minimum wage is so difficult!

988
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:53,430
I don't want to be a streamer forever!

989
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,310
Poor, poor, poor.

990
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:02,950
Alright, let's see.

991
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:06,690
Alright.

992
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,450
We should latte right?

993
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:09,270
I'm sorry!

994
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,830
This is not fair!

995
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,470
This is not an Asian coffee shop!

996
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:15,090
I don't know how to do any latte art!

997
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,070
Alright.

998
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:16,650
Alright.

999
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,950
Don't worry guys.

1000
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:25,390
I'm gonna...

1001
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:27,410
I'm gonna fucking...

1002
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:27,710
It's...

1003
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,330
Oh, I grinded coffee!

1004
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,790
I have a refill!

1005
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,690
Don't worry, please Oscar!

1006
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:33,370
Please!

1007
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,190
Save for me, Oscar!

1008
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,090
There's no decaf...

1009
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:39,550
We don't serve decaf tension!

1010
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,350
It's just coffee!

1011
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,810
That's all we have!

1012
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,470
Not even art in the cup!

1013
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:47,970
Oh my god, I forgot to even...

1014
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:48,990
Okay, I'm gonna use this.

1015
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,150
I'm gonna pour this one in.

1016
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:53,910
This is the only one I have.

1017
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:55,290
Okay.

1018
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:57,550
Okay, and then...

1019
00:43:57,550 --> 00:43:59,190
And then we're gonna put that.

1020
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,810
And then we're gonna pick up this.

1021
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:01,950
And we're gonna...

1022
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:02,890
Oh, please!

1023
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:04,490
And then we're gonna throw...

1024
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:04,890
No!

1025
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,670
It's full!

1026
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:07,150
Oh!

1027
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:08,850
Okay.

1028
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,450
Escape.

1029
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:11,890
Add inventories.

1030
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,310
Pick up the item.

1031
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:14,690
I have...

1032
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,310
There's an electric one too?

1033
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:18,350
Oh my god, I need that.

1034
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:19,830
Okay, and then...

1035
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,210
And then we put...

1036
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:22,730
Is this the bad coffee?

1037
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:23,870
I think it is.

1038
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:25,230
And then Oscar, please.

1039
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:26,510
Please stay with me.

1040
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,170
We're almost done with your order, Oscar.

1041
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:28,510
Please!

1042
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:30,830
Why does everybody want a triplo?

1043
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:32,410
I don't understand!

1044
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:33,930
Boom.

1045
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:34,870
Oscar, please!

1046
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:37,130
I'm making the triplo as fast as I can!

1047
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:37,450
Oscar!

1048
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:39,350
There's no...

1049
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,370
We don't sell hot chocolate gingerbread!

1050
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,850
Thank you for the super chat!

1051
00:44:42,970 --> 00:44:43,310
Thank you!

1052
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:44,810
Thank you!

1053
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:46,770
Thank you for the super chat!

1054
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:47,230
Thank you!

1055
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:47,490
Thank you!

1056
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,250
Oh my god, I should start grinding more coffee!

1057
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,030
Okay, fill, fill, fill, fill, fill, fill that coffee up.

1058
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,330
And then...

1059
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:55,790
Oh, wait, wait.

1060
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:56,310
Is it done?

1061
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,210
Is this done?

1062
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,330
I can't tell.

1063
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,790
No, there's still 60?

1064
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,510
I put them!

1065
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,930
One!

1066
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,090
Oh, okay.

1067
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:02,830
Oscar, please.

1068
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:03,910
We're almost done.

1069
00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:06,370
Oscar, please stay with us a little longer, Oscar!

1070
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:07,090
Okay, Oscar.

1071
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:08,250
Okay.

1072
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:09,450
All right.

1073
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:10,410
Yay!

1074
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:13,850
Oh, okay.

1075
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,250
What do I have to do?

1076
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,670
Did I finish grinding it?

1077
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,350
No, no, I didn't.

1078
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,030
All right.

1079
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:19,270
Grind, grind, grind.

1080
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,690
Pick this up.

1081
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:23,590
Throw it away.

1082
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,130
No, lady, please!

1083
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:26,650
I want to upgrade my store!

1084
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,950
They don't need lids!

1085
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,110
They're gonna drink it up!

1086
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:35,370
Okay.

1087
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,670
All right.

1088
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,070
Okay.

1089
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:37,710
Oh, okay.

1090
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:38,210
That's...

1091
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:38,770
Is that one?

1092
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:39,970
That's...

1093
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:40,550
Oh, my God.

1094
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:41,450
I don't remember the recipe.

1095
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:44,990
I have two recipes and I don't even remember the recipes already.

1096
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,910
Oh, it's just a double shot!

1097
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:47,610
All right.

1098
00:45:48,030 --> 00:45:50,110
And then we're gonna pick that up.

1099
00:45:50,670 --> 00:45:51,090
Boom!

1100
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,370
There we go.

1101
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:52,650
All right.

1102
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:52,970
Don't worry.

1103
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:53,530
I got you.

1104
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,330
All right.

1105
00:45:55,610 --> 00:45:56,430
What's your name?

1106
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:57,590
What's your name, ma'am?

1107
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,130
I'm gonna call...

1108
00:45:59,130 --> 00:45:59,810
What's your name?

1109
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:00,990
Madeline?

1110
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:02,130
Nice.

1111
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:06,210
That's also a red...

1112
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,070
I don't know.

1113
00:46:07,070 --> 00:46:07,490
Okay.

1114
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,270
There we go.

1115
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,190
Nice.

1116
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,330
All right.

1117
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,490
Don't worry, Madeline.

1118
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,150
I got you.

1119
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:13,910
Oh, my God.

1120
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:14,090
Yeah.

1121
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,510
Yeah.

1122
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:14,630
I...

1123
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:15,070
Fuck it.

1124
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:15,450
I need to buy.

1125
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,490
I have enough money, right?

1126
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:17,610
Actually, no.

1127
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,050
I should save up for a barista.

1128
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,130
I should...

1129
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:29,490
I'm gonna save up for a barista so I don't have to do this anymore.

1130
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,870
Can I get a...

1131
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:35,010
Never mind.

1132
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,890
Thank you for the supertube.

1133
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:37,050
I'm gonna go buy a barista.

1134
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,290
I'm gonna buy a barista.

1135
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:38,470
Thank you.

1136
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:39,110
Thank you.

1137
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,170
Okay.

1138
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:41,850
We gotta fill this up.

1139
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:45,230
No, we have enough coffee beans still.

1140
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:46,610
I mean, I guess we...

1141
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:47,010
Oh, wait.

1142
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:47,490
Nice.

1143
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:47,970
Okay.

1144
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:50,250
And then, we fill that up.

1145
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,650
Guys, I know we're missing something.

1146
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,450
I remember why this feels off right now.

1147
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:59,930
But first off, we gotta give this to her.

1148
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:00,730
Yeah!

1149
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,450
What the fuck?

1150
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,050
She took the entire tray with her.

1151
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,970
Oh, a customer wrote a review.

1152
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:12,550
Your shop will only operate during the fall of... wait, my shop's closed.

1153
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,710
Wait, my shop's... how did you get in here?

1154
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:19,330
Wait, my shop... what?

1155
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:21,930
How did she get in here?

1156
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,250
My shop was closed.

1157
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,190
How did she get in here?

1158
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,790
Guys, I'm sorry ma'am.

1159
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,570
It's illegal for you to be here.

1160
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,590
Like, it's illegal.

1161
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:37,190
Why are you...

1162
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:38,970
Why are you here?

1163
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,010
Okay, I guess I have to take her order.

1164
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,130
Alright.

1165
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,190
Is it double?

1166
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,190
What was your order?

1167
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:48,990
That's a 60, right?

1168
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,010
How did I already forgot?

1169
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,150
That is a 60.

1170
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:53,490
Okay.

1171
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:54,530
Boom.

1172
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:55,650
Alright.

1173
00:47:57,270 --> 00:47:58,630
Okay, we got...

1174
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,410
Oh!

1175
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:02,410
These coffees on a whole...

1176
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:03,350
other level...

1177
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:04,590
fake review.

1178
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:07,210
Oh!

1179
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,970
Wait, that's not what I meant.

1180
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,210
You should...

1181
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,010
Alright, nice.

1182
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:18,890
Oh, I should buy the coffee beans.

1183
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,630
Uhh... we need...

1184
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,830
Uhh...

1185
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,050
Coffee beans, standard...

1186
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:25,710
I want the cheapest kind.

1187
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:27,650
Is there a way to buy cheaper coffee?

1188
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:29,490
We have...

1189
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,430
They're all the same types of coffee though.

1190
00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:33,170
They're all so expensive.

1191
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,310
Uhh... we'll just get...

1192
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,610
We'll just get the regular $25.

1193
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,470
We'll just get that.

1194
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:45,090
Alright, that should be... Oh, we should fill this up again.

1195
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,670
Fill it up.

1196
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:48,910
You'll never notice.

1197
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:50,130
Uhh...

1198
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,270
This is just... I can't watch her be stressed.

1199
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,430
This is just making me stressed.

1200
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,230
I'm just giving PTSD to people.

1201
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,930
I'm just giving PTSD to people.

1202
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:02,870
There's so much information online.

1203
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,290
Doctor thank you for the super chat.

1204
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,690
Thank you.

1205
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,230
Thank you.

1206
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:06,910
Alright, here you go.

1207
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:07,370
Madeline.

1208
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,190
Wait!

1209
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,990
Oh, wait, did I not...

1210
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,150
Where did I... wait, where did my cup go?

1211
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,250
Did I just pour into another shot glass?

1212
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:17,730
Did I never make you a cup?

1213
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,430
I thought I wrote you a... Oh, what was your name?

1214
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,290
Oh, Savannah!

1215
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,290
I forgot to give you a name!

1216
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,430
There you go.

1217
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:26,730
You get a real name.

1218
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:27,450
Alright.

1219
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:28,350
Uhh...

1220
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,290
I poured it into another shot glass.

1221
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,610
A great streamer will watch again.

1222
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,050
Thank you for the super chat.

1223
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:37,250
Thank you, thank you.

1224
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:38,070
I didn't know.

1225
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,410
Oh my gosh, she's so happy.

1226
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,910
Okay, I'm almost there.

1227
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,310
I'm almost at...

1228
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:44,850
Okay, that should be closed now.

1229
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:47,030
Alright, now I have the shop to myself.

1230
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:49,870
Okay, let me see.

1231
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,470
What do I need to do to my shop?

1232
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,450
I have an 87% excellence.

1233
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:56,490
These coffees are a whole new level.

1234
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:57,830
This place rocks.

1235
00:49:57,830 --> 00:49:59,970
Best coffee in town.

1236
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:01,250
Look at that.

1237
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:02,990
Everybody loves my coffee, chat.

1238
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:04,730
Everybody loves it.

1239
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,010
I should sell cookies.

1240
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:07,130
I should.

1241
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,510
Do I have a license to sell, like, cookies?

1242
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:11,830
Well, we'll find out soon.

1243
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:13,210
Alright, let's see.

1244
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,170
What else can I make?

1245
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,170
The Espresso Machine A100.

1246
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,130
It can make espresso faster.

1247
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,290
Okay, I don't need that.

1248
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,810
If I have a barista, I'll be fine.

1249
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:23,150
Um...

1250
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,050
Those are...

1251
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:25,090
They're not bots!

1252
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:26,670
They're just as real as you guys.

1253
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:27,810
They're just...

1254
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,450
Just as real!

1255
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:31,850
Why are they all locked?

1256
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:32,650
Please!

1257
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,210
I spent my Dragoons tuition funds to open my dream store!

1258
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,530
My dream coffee shop!

1259
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,490
Okay, staff hire.

1260
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:42,450
We're almost there.

1261
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,290
Wait, we're level two.

1262
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,370
Cafe upgrade.

1263
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:47,710
I can have bodyguards?

1264
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:48,550
Am I gonna get robbed?

1265
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:50,090
Am I...

1266
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,530
Like, what?

1267
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,330
Am I gonna get robbed?

1268
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,570
Like, what?

1269
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:57,730
I'm gonna get robbed?

1270
00:50:57,730 --> 00:50:57,750
I'm gonna get robbed?

1271
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,790
I'm gonna get robbed?

1272
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:57,990
Alright.

1273
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:59,890
How do I...

1274
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,570
First, you unlock your cafe to level two.

1275
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:04,210
How do I...

1276
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,270
What does...

1277
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,710
What guarantees a level two?

1278
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:08,410
Why would I need parking space?

1279
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,650
Why would I need security?

1280
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:11,910
Why...

1281
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:15,170
I'm so confused.

1282
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,770
Oh my god!

1283
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:19,170
A hundred dollars a day?

1284
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,270
What the fuck?

1285
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:22,730
What the...

1286
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,790
I don't even get paid a hundred dollars a day.

1287
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:29,110
$100 a day.

1288
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:30,090
Wait...

1289
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:33,230
Okay.

1290
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:34,850
Alright, Liam.

1291
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,510
You gotta pay your college to it.

1292
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,530
What the fu- Oh, Liam's fell on hard times.

1293
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:41,630
Oh my god.

1294
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:42,710
Poor Liam.

1295
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,510
Okay, let me clean this.

1296
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:47,090
And clean this.

1297
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:50,470
And pick up my garbage bag.

1298
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:52,030
And...

1299
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:54,070
Wait, my cafe's starting to get dirty.

1300
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,650
Where's the... where's the trash?

1301
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,150
Liam, where's the trash?

1302
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:01,250
Where is...

1303
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:02,730
Where...

1304
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,550
Where do I put the trash?

1305
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,950
Can I just put the trash here?

1306
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,450
I'm just gonna put it here.

1307
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,610
This doesn't count, right?

1308
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,270
This counts as my cafe?

1309
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,510
There's no way that counts.

1310
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:16,370
It's not even on my property anymore.

1311
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:19,030
Who's gonna be at the back- Oh, it's over here.

1312
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:21,430
Who's gonna be at the back side of my property?

1313
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:23,770
Like, I don't...

1314
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:25,010
Wait, it didn't even matter!

1315
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:29,310
I would've literally just thrown... What the f- What happened?!

1316
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:32,850
What happened to my store?!

1317
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,970
Liam, did you do this?!

1318
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,250
Okay.

1319
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,450
Um... alright, let's see.

1320
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,790
We gotta... Oh my god, Liam.

1321
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,950
I gotta sweep.

1322
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:44,870
We gotta sweep.

1323
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,050
We gotta sweep.

1324
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:55,630
Liam, I know like, the financial crisis was like... I know like, people were having a hard time, Liam.

1325
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,310
And I know that like, your work doing this for your family.

1326
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,790
Liam, please.

1327
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:01,770
I need you.

1328
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:02,590
Please.

1329
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,470
You should have more than one job.

1330
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,270
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1331
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:08,070
Sweep, please.

1332
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:09,530
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1333
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:10,850
Okay, what time?

1334
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,270
At 8 AM.

1335
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:16,630
Okay, Liam, do you know how to... Do you know how to make coffee, Liam?

1336
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,510
Do you know how to make coffee?

1337
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,010
He gets paid $100 a day.

1338
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:31,710
You cannot say... You cannot say that Liam does not know... Does not get paid enough.

1339
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:35,130
Liam gets paid plenty of money.

1340
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,370
$100 a day.

1341
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,370
Alright, let's see.

1342
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:48,050
I'm gonna put this supply here.

1343
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,270
My stocks are...

1344
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,470
That doesn't even include tips!

1345
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,270
That doesn't even include tips!

1346
00:53:55,050 --> 00:54:06,290
I'm earning better than like 80% of like American restaurant owners because 80% of them operate on tips alone and pay like fairly minimum wage.

1347
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:15,210
That doesn't even include the tips!

1348
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:16,910
Who tips baristas?

1349
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,070
I tip baristas!

1350
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:20,490
Cause I'm a decent person!

1351
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:23,810
I tip 15% percent!

1352
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,470
I'm an actual decent person!

1353
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,170
Okay...

1354
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,530
Um... Alright, we got...

1355
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,510
I think I know why I'm like really stressed out.

1356
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,070
I need some coffee... I need some coffee music.

1357
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:41,310
I need coffee shop music!

1358
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:46,210
Okay...

1359
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:52,110
Coffee shop copyright free music!

1360
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,990
Okay...

1361
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,970
Okay...

1362
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,810
Now I know why I'm like extra stressed out.

1363
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:00,810
There we go!

1364
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,430
There we go!

1365
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:04,610
Can you guys hear this?

1366
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,730
You guys hear it?

1367
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,950
Alright...

1368
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,110
Alright, how about coffee and ambient?

1369
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:16,970
I need like ambient noise so it feels like... I feel like I'm actually in a coffee shop.

1370
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:17,530
I need it!

1371
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:18,370
I need it!

1372
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:23,730
Oh my god!

1373
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:24,430
Oh my god!

1374
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:24,850

1375
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,630
Alright...

1376
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,550
There we go guys.

1377
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:29,550
Give me a sec.

1378
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:31,990
There we go guys.

1379
00:55:32,090 --> 00:55:32,710
Can you hear this?

1380
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,030
Alright...

1381
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,010
Oh my god, the longer he's... I need to go to bed.

1382
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:38,590
I need...

1383
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,330
I need to be more immersed guys.

1384
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,670
Alright, same.

1385
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,790
Okay, I'll up it up a little bit too.

1386
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,250
Um...

1387
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,630
I'll up it up a little bit.

1388
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:55,390
There we go.

1389
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,170
There we go!

1390
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:00,610
Just so we feel like we're there.

1391
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:02,210
Alright, let's see.

1392
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:03,790
I need to interact with bed.

1393
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:04,490
Bed, let me!

1394
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:06,950
I need to be up at 8!

1395
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:08,290
Okay, let's see.

1396
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:10,250
Four hours.

1397
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,370
Alright, sleep.

1398
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:14,650
Alright.

1399
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,650
Alright, Liam.

1400
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,730
Are you ready for another day of hard work, Liam?

1401
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,230
In one day!

1402
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:25,650
I could finally afford an employee!

1403
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:27,870
In one day!

1404
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:29,950
Isn't that crazy?

1405
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:32,090
We have no bathrooms here.

1406
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:33,450
Um...

1407
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:34,590
Let's see.

1408
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:37,150
I'm gonna make sure that we have... Liam!

1409
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:38,510
Do you know how to make coffee?

1410
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,670
We can only make three types of coffee.

1411
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,570
We can make, um...

1412
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,870
all these three coffees!

1413
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:49,530
Liam, do you know how to make coffee?

1414
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,310
Alright.

1415
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,010
Alright, let's see.

1416
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:00,090
They should arrive any moment now.

1417
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,110
I'm gonna supervise.

1418
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:02,170
Now I'm a supervisor.

1419
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:09,630
After one day of working, I have finally decided to be a supervisor.

1420
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:13,610
Oh, flip the sign!

1421
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:14,890
We're open!

1422
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,770
We're open!

1423
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:19,990
Liam's first day of work!

1424
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,840
There's...

1425
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,180
I swear to fucking...

1426
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:32,560
Okay.

1427
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:33,860
Okay.

1428
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,820
Give me a second.

1429
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,280
Alright.

1430
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,860
There's one... There's...

1431
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,580
Okay.

1432
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:44,260
Okay.

1433
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,000
Alright.

1434
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:49,860
There's one...

1435
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,680
Open cashier...

1436
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,800
But no, that's okay.

1437
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,380
What does Liam do?

1438
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,300
What does he do?

1439
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:03,940
I'm literally paying him a hundred dollars!

1440
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,100
Okay.

1441
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,800
Let's see.

1442
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,180
Liam!

1443
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:12,360
Liam, are you working?

1444
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:14,860
Oh my god, Liam's working!

1445
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:15,640
Wait!

1446
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:16,520
Liam's working!

1447
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:17,880
Wait, what was...

1448
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:18,760
Okay, that's three.

1449
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:19,640
Okay.

1450
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:21,780
Um... boom!

1451
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:22,960
Alright.

1452
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:26,420
Okay, don't worry, I'll put the music a little bit up.

1453
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,600
Pretty immersiveness.

1454
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,240
There we go.

1455
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:31,240
Oh my god!

1456
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,700
Oh my god, he's actually working!

1457
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,260
He's doing it!

1458
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:36,920
Oh shit, I should... I should grind off.

1459
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:39,760
I don't know what he's doing right now, but like, I think he's...

1460
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:40,620
Wait, is it empty?

1461
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:41,820
Wait, where's my...

1462
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,860
Do I not have more?

1463
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:45,300
Where... oh, okay, there we go.

1464
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:45,580
Place.

1465
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:47,940
There we go.

1466
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,160
Um...

1467
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:51,520
Alright, and then fill it up.

1468
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:52,860
He's doing it!

1469
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,680
He's doing it!

1470
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,440
I need to hire another barista though!

1471
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,720
Okay, 60 and then... pick up.

1472
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:00,800
And then pick up.

1473
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,020
Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind.

1474
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,300
Oh my god, I can make so much money now!

1475
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,420
I can have two at once!

1476
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,960
Oh, I need to name you!

1477
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,580
What's your name?

1478
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,180
Um... your name.

1479
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:10,800
Andre.

1480
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,520
Oh shit!

1481
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,000
Ah!

1482
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:13,220
Ah!

1483
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:15,760
Andre!

1484
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:17,880
There we go.

1485
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,080
Nice.

1486
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,000
And then I'll put that here.

1487
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,160
No, that doesn't have anything in it.

1488
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:23,540
Please, I'm so sorry.

1489
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:24,100
Please.

1490
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:26,560
Okay, and then I fill it up.

1491
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:28,520
I'll fill... please Andre, just stay with me.

1492
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,640
I just need to make 30 more.

1493
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:30,780
Please, Andre.

1494
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:31,880
Please.

1495
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,520
Please don't leave, Andre.

1496
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,080
Okay.

1497
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:37,300
Ah, and then I need to throw this away!

1498
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:39,540
Andre, please!

1499
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,100
I'm doing my best, Andre!

1500
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,340
Okay, and then I fill it up.

1501
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,400
Fill, fill, fill, fill.

1502
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:46,540
Fill, fill.

1503
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,120
And then...

1504
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:49,620
Put it in.

1505
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:51,560
And then... math.

1506
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,320
Andre, we're almost done, Andre.

1507
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:53,720
Please.

1508
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,560
We just... we just need...

1509
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,920
Andre, please.

1510
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:01,660
Please just wait a little bit longer, Andre.

1511
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:03,820
Oh, I need to grind more coffee beans!

1512
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,200
I forgot!

1513
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:05,120
Okay.

1514
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,440
Coffee beans.

1515
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,060
Fill.

1516
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,740
Fill the coffee beans.

1517
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,420
Okay.

1518
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,580
Grind, grind, grind, grind.

1519
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:16,820
Andre, I'm almost... I unlocked...

1520
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:18,080
What the fuck?

1521
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,020
I unlocked what?

1522
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,220
What did I unlock?

1523
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,380
Okay.

1524
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,400
Andre, please.

1525
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,780
Wait, is it just... Oh, only two!

1526
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:26,700
Sorry.

1527
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,200
Yay!

1528
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:31,060
I did it in advance.

1529
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:31,660
Okay.

1530
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,320
Oh, I have an idea!

1531
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,900
I'll just leave all these shots here.

1532
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:38,580
I'll just leave all these shots here.

1533
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:40,520
So that... um...

1534
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,280
So I have them in advance.

1535
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:42,920
Okay.

1536
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,460
That's just one.

1537
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,000
Okay.

1538
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:46,080
And then...

1539
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:47,920
I need...

1540
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:48,180
No!

1541
01:00:53,410 --> 01:00:54,290
What the...

1542
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:54,890
Okay.

1543
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,130
Knock stand.

1544
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:58,570
Knock box.

1545
01:00:58,930 --> 01:01:01,030
And then I already grind that up.

1546
01:01:01,210 --> 01:01:03,390
So then I just need to pour it... throw it in there.

1547
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,630
And then I'll put it in.

1548
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,550
And then... BAM!

1549
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:09,410
What's your name?

1550
01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:09,930
Chris!

1551
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:10,910
Okay, Chris.

1552
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:12,410
Don't worry, Chris.

1553
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:14,070
I got you.

1554
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:16,290
There you go.

1555
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:18,850
That's Chris in my language.

1556
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:20,270
Alright.

1557
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,370
I need... I need another staff.

1558
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,390
I... I need another staff member.

1559
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:27,870
Why can't I have two staff members?

1560
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:29,110
Why do I...

1561
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:29,750
Why...

1562
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:32,690
What do you mean I have to upgrade my shop... store again?

1563
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:34,070
What do you mean?

1564
01:01:34,590 --> 01:01:35,570
I don't...

1565
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,230
Why do we have to upgrade it again?

1566
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,730
What if I have another shelf?

1567
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:41,390
Um...

1568
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:42,390
Okay.

1569
01:01:42,690 --> 01:01:43,330
Uh...

1570
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:45,450
Oh, there's so many people.

1571
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:46,870
Um...

1572
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:47,310
Okay.

1573
01:01:47,350 --> 01:01:48,210
What if I...

1574
01:01:48,210 --> 01:01:48,970
What...

1575
01:01:48,970 --> 01:01:50,970
What if I hire...

1576
01:01:50,970 --> 01:01:52,190
Am I level three?

1577
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:53,410
Am I...

1578
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:55,630
Am I... Am I level three?

1579
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,350
Is this level three?

1580
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:58,630
Or is it a store?

1581
01:01:59,170 --> 01:01:59,690
Is it...

1582
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:01,830
No, we're not in the red!

1583
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:02,910
We have $400!

1584
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:05,050
Uh...

1585
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:05,690
Okay.

1586
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,930
And then we fill it up.

1587
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:08,930
Uh... We fill it up right here.

1588
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:12,110
Don't worry, Chris.

1589
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:12,870
I got you.

1590
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:15,930
And... BAM!

1591
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:17,050
Chris is happy.

1592
01:02:17,270 --> 01:02:17,670
Okay.

1593
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:18,290
I'm gonna...

1594
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:18,970
I...

1595
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:19,670
I need...

1596
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:20,950
I need to upgrade my cafe.

1597
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:21,710
I don't...

1598
01:02:24,910 --> 01:02:25,430
Okay.

1599
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,430
What does the parking do?

1600
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,130
I don't have money.

1601
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:32,610
But, like, I could upgrade warehouse.

1602
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:34,290
Does this...

1603
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,830
Does this upgrade my cafe?

1604
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:37,550
Does this...

1605
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:41,930
My...

1606
01:02:42,670 --> 01:02:44,410
Do I have enough to hire?

1607
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:44,850
No!

1608
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,790
Mine's still not level three!

1609
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,450
I bought it!

1610
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,490
What do you want?

1611
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,850
You want two orders?!

1612
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:54,350
Um...

1613
01:02:54,350 --> 01:02:55,430
Uh...

1614
01:02:55,430 --> 01:02:56,570
Expresso...

1615
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:57,070
Uh...

1616
01:02:57,070 --> 01:02:57,950
What...

1617
01:02:57,950 --> 01:02:59,450
What is the espresso?

1618
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:01,090
Oh, that's just 30.

1619
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,010
Okay.

1620
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:02,810
Um...

1621
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,670
Oh, I don't have cups.

1622
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:05,570
I don't...

1623
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:07,750
Oh...

1624
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:09,590
Okay.

1625
01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:11,670
Ordered some cups.

1626
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,190
And, please...

1627
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,770
Please wait.

1628
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:14,830
I don't have cups!

1629
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:16,450
I don't have cups!

1630
01:03:16,450 --> 01:03:16,770
I don't have cups!

1631
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:21,010
Okay, no... my cafe is starting to get dirty!

1632
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:21,850
No!

1633
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:23,770
It's okay!

1634
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:30,470
Okay, we need to throw this away.

1635
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,290
Okay, and then... we gotta put this up.

1636
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,510
What do you mean it's empty?

1637
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:40,910
What?

1638
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:42,570
What do you mean?

1639
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:46,250
Did I... Oh, is this already filled?

1640
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:48,010
This is already filled.

1641
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,050
Oh, it's already filled.

1642
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,850
Oh, I get it.

1643
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:53,130
Where's the delivery guy?

1644
01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:53,830
I don't have cups.

1645
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,430
I'm sorry!

1646
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,610
I... I don't have cups!

1647
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:57,650
I...

1648
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:02,790
I'm sorry!

1649
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,750
I don't... We need cups!

1650
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:06,830
Where's... where's Amazon?

1651
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:08,970
Where... where's...

1652
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:14,370

01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:21,490
I... Guys, I need cups!

1654
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,170
I don't have any cups!

1655
01:04:29,210 --> 01:04:30,530
I did!

1656
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:32,170
I did!

1657
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,270
I ordered cups!

1658
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:34,770
Where's the cups?

01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:37,670
I'm a mess!

1661
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,370
I'll order more!

1662
01:04:43,790 --> 01:04:44,390
Amazon!

1663
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:46,050
Amazon, where are you?

1664
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:49,150
We can't... we can't do anything!

1665
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,250
Oh, I should clean.

1666
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:52,610
I should... I should bring out my broom.

1667
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:55,030
How did this place got dirty too?

1668
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:56,430
Okay.

1669
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:00,750
Hey, clean, clean, clean.

1670
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,410
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1671
01:05:03,430 --> 01:05:04,810
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1672
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:10,830
Oh, no!

1673
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:13,430
Oh, cargo arrived!

1674
01:05:13,930 --> 01:05:16,710
I have cups!

1675
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:17,270
I have cups!

1676
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,490
I have cups!

1677
01:05:19,970 --> 01:05:20,570
Oh!

1678
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,610
Okay.

1679
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,710
You can do your order now.

1680
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:24,190
Okay.

1681
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,270
Um... um... oh.

1682
01:05:28,070 --> 01:05:28,670
There.

1683
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,710
And then... um...

1684
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:35,250
And then... fill.

1685
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:37,350
This is 30, right?

1686
01:05:37,910 --> 01:05:39,950
Is this... this is the...

1687
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,150
Um... and then... the...

1688
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:45,530
Um... and then...

1689
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:45,530

1690
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:46,530
This is two, right?

1691
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:46,930
Okay.

1692
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:47,610
This is two.

1693
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:48,510
Okay.

1694
01:05:48,830 --> 01:05:49,270
Okay.

1695
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:49,990
Shock glass.

1696
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,270
Shock glass.

1697
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:52,350
Boom!

1698
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,890
Please wait.

1699
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:54,590
Please wait, sir.

1700
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,350
Sir, please.

1701
01:05:56,590 --> 01:05:57,750
I got cups.

1702
01:05:58,110 --> 01:05:58,930
You are back!

1703
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,590
You are... Oh, wait.

1704
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:00,730
No.

1705
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:01,370
You are a different guy.

1706
01:06:01,430 --> 01:06:01,610
Sorry.

1707
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,410
I thought you reminded me of something.

1708
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:03,770
Okay.

1709
01:06:04,770 --> 01:06:05,210
Oh...

1710
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:08,910
Tell... you friends.

1711
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,390
There you go.

1712
01:06:12,530 --> 01:06:13,130
Alright.

1713
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:13,670
Nice.

1714
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,770
Uh... here you go.

1715
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:16,250
Uh...

1716
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:17,570
Okay.

1717
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:20,050
Guys, it's a... it's a coffee shop music.

1718
01:06:20,190 --> 01:06:23,670
Are you guys feeling calm from the coffee shop music, guys?

1719
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:28,370
Guys, are you guys... are you guys feeling calm from the coffee shop music?

1720
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,360
Is... is it calming you?

1721
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,720
No, not at all.

1722
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:45,940
Wait, was that... was that not coffee?

1723
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:47,320
Is that water?

1724
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:51,120
Did I... did I...

1725
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,700
Is this not coffee in here?

1726
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,680
What's in here?

1727
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:03,560
What's in here?

1728
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,660
Please wait a little bit, sir.

1729
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:12,020
I accidentally put... I accidentally put nothing in the filter.

1730
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:15,260
Please.

1731
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:18,620
I didn't... it bugged out.

1732
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,900
My coffee shop bugged out.

1733
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:30,780
Okay, I'll put up the sound a little... I'll put it up a little bit more.

1734
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,660
Let me know if you're feeling extra immersive.

1735
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,620
Guys, please.

1736
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,500
It's almost there, sir.

1737
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:40,260
It's almost there.

1738
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:41,760
Just wait a little longer.

1739
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:44,780
You're getting a customer anxiety.

1740
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:48,660
Please.

1741
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:50,240
Please, my dragons.

1742
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:55,220
I used their college tuition, sir.

1743
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:56,980
Please, this is all I have.

1744
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,660
You can't leave a negative review.

1745
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:05,620
If you leave a negative review, all 750,000 of my dragons can't go to college.

1746
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,500
Okay, we're almost there.

1747
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:15,680
Alright, let's see.

1748
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,920
Okay, nice.

1749
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:18,320
We gotta fill it up.

1750
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,220
Alright.

1751
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,320
Please don't leave.

1752
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:25,280
Please, we're almost... I'm done.

1753
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:26,820
Yay!

1754
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,780
I did it!

1755
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,120
Yay!

1756
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,720
Three stars?

1757
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:36,380
You can't say best coffee in town and give me three stars!

1758
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,120
Okay.

1759
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,620
I'm calm.

1760
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:45,720
Wait, I got new... I got new... I got some more cups, guys.

1761
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,480
I got... this tree is... I'm having more flashbacks.

1762
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:55,240
Um... I need... I need to invest.

1763
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:56,560
I need to start investing.

1764
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:58,940
Okay, hello, what do you want?

1765
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,180
Okay, that's 60.

1766
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,200
I just... I just grinded this out, so we should be good.

1767
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:08,340
Alright, and then... fill it up.

1768
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,860
You know... It's okay.

1769
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:16,120
Everything... They don't need to be happy.

1770
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,300
They're here for coffee.

1771
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,120
Oh...

1772
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:19,980
Oh, there we go.

1773
01:09:20,220 --> 01:09:21,420
What's your name, sir?

1774
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,080
Casey.

1775
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,540
Okay, Casey.

1776
01:09:26,540 --> 01:09:27,500
Send... help.

1777
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:33,820
Alright.

1778
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:34,500
Let's see.

1779
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,140
Where did the... Okay.

1780
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,620
We're just gonna put the... Just in case if somebody needs water.

1781
01:09:39,020 --> 01:09:40,200
They don't need happiness!

1782
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:41,860
They're here for coffee!

1783
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,460
That's enough happiness for them!

1784
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,000
That's enough happiness!

1785
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:47,100
Um... What is it?

1786
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:47,900
What time is it?

1787
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,180
It's only 6pm?

1788
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,300
What do you mean it's only 6pm?

1789
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:56,020
I feel like I've been working for 5 hours already!

1790
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:57,160
Like...

1791
01:09:59,240 --> 01:09:59,880
Okay.

1792
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:01,120
Alright.

1793
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,860
Alright, and then we got... grinder here.

1794
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:06,840
And we're almost there.

1795
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:10,840
Alright.

1796
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:14,280
We're... We're working so hard.

1797
01:10:14,540 --> 01:10:15,580
Okay, pick up.

1798
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,300
Alright, fill... Fill it up.

1799
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:19,760
Okay.

1800
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,640
Let's keep this... We only have 3 recipes!

1801
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:26,760
Guys, we... We've only unlocked 3 recipes!

1802
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,500
That's like the worst part!

1803
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:35,440
We've only unlocked 3 recipes, but I feel like... I feel like it's already 3 too many.

1804
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:40,200
It feels like there's... It feels way too many.

1805
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,140
Okay, we're gonna get... We're getting an actual coffee grinder.

1806
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,300
And then... And then we're gonna get...

1807
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,100
Um...

1808
01:10:48,100 --> 01:10:49,600
Okay, we don't... You don't need milk.

1809
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,260
Okay, we don't need any of that.

1810
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,460
And we don't need this.

1811
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,040
So we're gonna get... What's the...

1812
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:58,080
It consists of a filling chamber.

1813
01:10:58,220 --> 01:10:58,840
It's making a filter.

1814
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:00,380
Thanks to the filter.

1815
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,660
Wait, what?

1816
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,240
Why would I need a filter machine?

1817
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,540
Okay, we're gonna grab...

1818
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,040
The espresso.

1819
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:09,940
Okay, we're broke.

1820
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:10,920
But it's okay.

1821
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:11,640
What do you want?

1822
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:13,080
You want... Okay, 2.

1823
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,060
Wait, I just got enough for that.

1824
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:15,880
Okay.

1825
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,920
And then... We put it here.

1826
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,720
And then we fill it up.

1827
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,240
We fill it up.

1828
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,760
Guys, we can finally upgrade!

1829
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,340
Um... Put it here.

1830
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:29,120
And then...

1831
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:29,780
Boop!

1832
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:30,900
Guys!

1833
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,080
We can finally afford an upgrade!

1834
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:34,140
Alright, Danny.

1835
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:38,160
I'm feeling a little... I'm a little confident here.

1836
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:40,340
Yeah!

1837
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,160
This is how I feel right now!

1838
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:43,460
I think we can do this!

1839
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:47,420
Guys, I think... Guys, I think...

1840
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,700
I think we're like... actual coffee shop owners now.

1841
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:51,680
I'm not stressed anymore.

1842
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,200
I... I think I've got the hang... hang of this now.

1843
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,080
Alright.

1844
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,000
Fill, fill, fill.

1845
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:57,660
Oh.

1846
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,200
Oh no, I'm out of coffee.

1847
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,500
Um... Um...

1848
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,480
Oh, I haven't paid rent at all.

1849
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,460
Oh... Okay, I... I just... Oh, it's just $10.

1850
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:08,320
Oh my god, thank god.

1851
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:09,480
Rent is just $10.

1852
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,660
Alright, we'll buy some... You know what?

1853
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:12,140
We'll buy 2.

1854
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:13,320
I feel a little adventurous.

1855
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:17,080
Uh... Oh no, is this at 60 yet?

1856
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,760
Oh, when is the delivery truck?

1857
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:20,480
Why does the delivery take 2 minutes?

1858
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:22,300
Oh, my coffee shop's a mess!

1859
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:26,940
Okay, um... That's okay.

1860
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,000
I feel great.

1861
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:29,020
I still feel great.

1862
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:29,760

1863
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,480
I still feel great, guys.

1864
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,040
Everything's a-okay.

1867
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,480
Everything is still okay.

1868
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:46,520
Uh...

1869
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:51,320
Um... Okay, and then now it's closing time.

1870
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:52,200
Okay.

1871
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,220
Alright.

1872
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,240
Nice.

1873
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,820
Alright, let's start cleaning.

1874
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,900
Let's start cleaning the shop a little bit.

1875
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,100
We need a...

1876
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:02,380

01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:05,120
Now it's time to clean.

1878
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,920
And then...

1879
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:08,160
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1880
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:09,620
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

1881
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:13,640
Do I have to pay you?

1882
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:16,100
Do you not get automatically paid?

1883
01:13:17,420 --> 01:13:19,980
Are you... Why do I have 79%?

1884
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:23,500
The blessed... Is this the best place I've ever seen?

1885
01:13:25,340 --> 01:13:29,340
Uh... No, I don't think... I don't... I think he's like automatically paid for.

1886
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:30,220
Right?

1887
01:13:31,780 --> 01:13:33,600
Uh... Why would I need parking?

1888
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:36,560
I feel like I don't need any of that.

1889
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,280
Alright, that's fine.

1890
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:38,020
It's okay.

1891
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,660
My order is here now.

1892
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,460
Uh... Alright, let's see.

1893
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:45,560
This is the electric grinder.

1894
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,060
Um... One for making coffee is the grinder.

1895
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:50,280
Feel... Okay, nice.

1896
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,060
Now I can do it electrically.

1897
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,620
Alright, that's good.

1898
01:13:54,380 --> 01:13:55,320
That is good.

1899
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:59,160
Um... I don't have to worry about that anymore.

1900
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,920
And I think I ordered more cups.

1901
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:03,420
I'm pretty sure.

1902
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:06,200
I think we have more cups.

1903
01:14:06,260 --> 01:14:07,160
Yeah, it auto-pays.

1904
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:07,700
Thank God.

1905
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,060
Okay, I don't have to worry about paying him.

1906
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:15,490
I gotta remember to place coffee.

1907
01:14:16,110 --> 01:14:17,770
We gotta restock our coffee.

1908
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,650
I'm just waiting.

1909
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:19,670
Alright, thank you.

Alright, nice.

1914
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:30,890
We only allow one order of coffee.

1915
01:14:31,170 --> 01:14:32,670
Okay, I need a kettle?

1916
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:34,110
Do I...

1917
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:38,470
I don't know if I want a kettle right now.

1918
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:40,350

1919
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:43,830
I don't have an express... Oh, this is an express machine.

1920
01:14:45,130 --> 01:14:46,790

You don't have to come to my store more.

1926
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:02,450

Oh, I need to fill more coffee.

And then fill this here.

1939
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:35,870

1940
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:38,450
Wait, that's a lot.

01:15:39,090 --> 01:15:40,450
Wait, that's so many.

01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:44,970
Oh my god, wait, I can do so many things with 150.

1943
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:48,270
Wait, I don't have to grind coffee anymore!

1944
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:52,170
Oh my god, I don't have to grind coffee anymore!

1945
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:53,870
How do I... How do I do this?

1946
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:56,230
Do I just... turn it on?

1947
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:58,650
Oh my god!

1948
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:01,850
I don't have to be a caveman anymore!

1949
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,950
Okay, and then...

1950
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,510

I'm gonna pre-make.

1959
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,090
I'm gonna pre-make shots.

1960
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,670
Oh my... I figured this out, guys.

1961
01:16:24,950 --> 01:16:26,390
Guys, I figured this out.

1962
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:28,370
We pre-make the shots now.

1963
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,130
So like, we don't have to worry.

1964
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:32,850
We don't have to worry about... Oh, I need to buy more cups.

1965
01:16:33,170 --> 01:16:34,070
Okay, cups.

1966
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,210
Uh, let's buy more minis.

1967
01:16:37,210 --> 01:16:40,050
Cause like, I don't want you guys to order anything more.

1968
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:43,130
Like, you guys already... We already have too many things.

1969
01:16:43,530 --> 01:16:44,430
No, it's okay!

1970
01:16:44,430 --> 01:16:45,510
They won't know!

1971
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,710
It doesn't tell temperature!

1972
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,890
They won't know!

1973
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:57,110
They won't be able to tell!

1974
01:17:01,770 --> 01:17:06,790
I guess somebody's like, please, if you're gonna cut corners, wait till day three.

1975
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:10,830
Oh, so it's the music.

1976
01:17:11,170 --> 01:17:12,070

01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:13,130
It's the...

1978
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,290
It's the coffee shop music good enough now?

1979
01:17:15,490 --> 01:17:16,050
Alright.

1980
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:17,390
I swear.

1981
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:18,230
Okay, we're gonna experiment.

1982
01:17:18,690 --> 01:17:19,010
Okay?

1983
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:20,490
In 94...

1984
01:17:20,490 --> 01:17:21,630
Wait, it's going down.

1985
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:23,010
Wait!

1986
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:23,770
No!

1987
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:30,170
Does anyone want cold coffee?

1988
01:17:30,410 --> 01:17:31,510
Does any...

1989
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:37,290
I need to be able to afford...

1990
01:17:37,970 --> 01:17:38,310
Um...

1991
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,650
I need to be able to afford...

1992
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:42,110
Uh...

1993
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,630
Okay, we need seven hours.

1994
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:48,450
I need to afford a microwave so I can microwave the coffee.

1995
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,810
We gotta be able to...

1996
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,850
Able to microwave the coffee later.

1997
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:54,750
Um...

1998
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:56,190
Oh, no.

1999
01:17:56,250 --> 01:17:57,350
How far is it?

2000
01:17:58,890 --> 01:17:59,850
Oh, it's so...

2001
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:00,630
It's so warm!

2002
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,050
It's so warm!

2003
01:18:02,210 --> 01:18:02,990
I knew it!

2004
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:04,230
I knew...

2005
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:04,730
Oh, my God.

2006
01:18:04,830 --> 01:18:05,310
Oh, my God.

2007
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:05,750
We did it.

2008
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:06,770
It's still warm.

2009
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:07,690
It's still warm.

2010
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:09,570
Okay, I got it.

2011
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:11,510
Not...

2012
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:13,310
90 Fahrenheit.

2013
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:15,750
Coffee.

2014
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:18,070
So, don't know.

2015
01:18:18,150 --> 01:18:18,970
It's still warm.

2016
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:20,250
It's still warm.

2017
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:21,370
All right.

2018
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,710
And I'll fill it up.

2019
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:25,350
I'll fill it up.

2020
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:29,630
It's still warm.

2021
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:30,670
It's still there.

2022
01:18:30,730 --> 01:18:31,270
It's still there.

2023
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:32,730
It's still ready.

2024
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:33,470
We're still ready.

2025
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,970
Come in, please!

2026
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:36,410
Somebody!

2027
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:38,410
Somebody come in!

2028
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:39,150
Right now!

2029
01:18:42,470 --> 01:18:43,590
Wait, is that Celsius?

2030
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:44,710
It was 7...

2031
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:45,490
There's no way.

2032
01:18:45,930 --> 01:18:47,630
There's no way it's 77...

2033
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:48,830
Okay, what do you want?

2034
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:49,670
Oh.

2035
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:51,310
No, that's 60.

2036
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:52,450
Wait, no.

2037
01:18:52,990 --> 01:18:53,870
Wait, is it...

2038
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:55,410
Is it like mini...

2039
01:18:55,870 --> 01:18:57,010
Wait, what did you want?

2040
01:18:58,370 --> 01:18:58,810
Espresso.

2041
01:18:59,530 --> 01:18:59,970
No!

2042
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:06,030
You ordered the one thing I don't have!

2043
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:07,770
Okay.

2044
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:10,790
Oh, my God.

2045
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:11,430
It was a 30.

2046
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:11,490
Okay.

2047
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:12,670
It was a 30, but that's okay.

2048
01:19:12,810 --> 01:19:13,230
That's okay.

2049
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:14,430
It's okay.

2050
01:19:14,490 --> 01:19:15,350
The next customer...

2051
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:17,490
The next customer is going to order one.

2052
01:19:18,570 --> 01:19:19,470
It's still fine.

2053
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:20,510
We're still fine.

2054
01:19:20,830 --> 01:19:21,670
We're so healthy.

2055
01:19:22,910 --> 01:19:23,710
What's your name?

2056
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:25,110
Wait, you're Tom.

2057
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:25,950
Okay, you're Tommy.

2058
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:26,250
Okay.

2059
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:32,150
Hot coffee.

2060
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:33,910
There you go.

2061
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:36,570
And then I'll put that here.

2062
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:40,890
And then I don't need to grind anything anymore, so we're fine.

2063
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,470
Okay.

2064
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:42,410
Where's my Amazon?

2065
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:43,310
Okay, we need more cups.

2066
01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:44,290
We need more cups, though.

2067
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:46,370
We need more cups.

2068
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:47,150
All right.

2069
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:47,670
Bam!

2070
01:19:48,390 --> 01:19:49,170
I think we're going to...

2071
01:19:49,170 --> 01:19:50,130
We need to make more.

2072
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:52,530
We need to make more money so we can buy a better coffee machine.

2073
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,310
So we can make more coffee.

2074
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:55,470
Oh, no.

2075
01:19:55,530 --> 01:19:56,230
It's at 63.

2076
01:19:57,090 --> 01:19:57,770
Oh, please.

2077
01:19:57,930 --> 01:19:58,950
Is it done yet?

2078
01:19:59,050 --> 01:19:59,550
Oh, it's done.

2079
01:19:59,650 --> 01:19:59,830
Okay.

2080
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,230
Which one's the right one?

2081
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:02,190
This one right here.

2082
01:20:02,650 --> 01:20:03,150
All right.

2083
01:20:03,330 --> 01:20:04,430
Wait, I have two customers?

2084
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:05,930
I have two customers?

2085
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:06,870
Wait.

2086
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:09,710
Why do I have two customers?

2087
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:11,470
You also want an Amazon?

2088
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:13,650
Why do you all want an espresso?

2089
01:20:15,650 --> 01:20:16,930
I don't understand.

2090
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:20,990
How do you all want espressos?

2091
01:20:21,610 --> 01:20:22,230
All right.

2092
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:23,190
Right here.

2093
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:25,170
Oh, no.

2094
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,990
My coffee's not getting hot anymore.

2095
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:30,110
Okay.

2096
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:31,450
Oh, my gosh.

2097
01:20:31,530 --> 01:20:31,910
Please.

2098
01:20:32,470 --> 01:20:33,030
Please.

2099
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:36,210
It's at 56 degrees Celsius now.

2100
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:37,850
No!

2101
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:40,590
Liam, what do I do?

2102
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:41,270
Liam!

2103
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:41,450
Liam!

2104
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:44,010
My reviews are going down!

2105
01:20:44,270 --> 01:20:44,950
Not anymore.

2106
01:20:49,010 --> 01:20:51,270
The best barista in town.

2107
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:55,830
Doki, please.

2108
01:20:55,990 --> 01:21:02,310
You have to spend your money on actually improving your store, not buying fake reviews.

2109
01:21:02,450 --> 01:21:03,870
You can't stop me.

2110
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,090
All right.

2111
01:21:08,070 --> 01:21:09,030
Here you go.

2112
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:09,850
Oh.

2113
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:10,230
Oh.

2114
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:10,510
Oh.

2115
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,050
All right.

2116
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,550
What's...

2117
01:21:13,990 --> 01:21:14,430
Okay.

2118
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:15,350
Um...

2119
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:17,110
I got...

2120
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:20,210
This is how I feel on the inside right now.

2121
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:21,750
Do you want...

2122
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:22,590
What do you want?

2123
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:24,370
You also want an espresso?

2124
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:26,050
Why do you all want espressos?

2125
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:26,530
I don't understand!

2126
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:29,250
Why do you all want espressos?

2127
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:31,130
All right.

2128
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:33,170
Okay.

2129
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:33,710
We're good.

2130
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:34,010
We're good.

2131
01:21:34,010 --> 01:21:34,310
We're good.

2132
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:35,450
We're good.

2133
01:21:36,130 --> 01:21:36,570
Um...

2134
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:39,070
We should have more shot glasses.

2135
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:40,990
We have unlimited shot glasses.

2136
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:41,590
This is where we're fine.

2137
01:21:42,150 --> 01:21:42,590
Alright.

2138
01:21:43,990 --> 01:21:44,750
I'm 200.

2139
01:21:47,530 --> 01:21:48,190
Let's see.

2140
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:50,670
Okay, and then we gotta pick your... what's your name?

2141
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:51,370
Neil?

2142
01:21:54,550 --> 01:21:55,710
This is how I feel.

2143
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,130
Neil, please.

2144
01:21:58,390 --> 01:22:00,030
This is how I feel, Neil.

2145
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,770
I don't want you to be sad.

2146
01:22:09,250 --> 01:22:09,690
Please.

2147
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:10,650
Please.

2148
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:14,310
I just want somebody to order...

2149
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:16,170
an order of coffee.

2150
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:18,030
Please.

2151
01:22:18,030 --> 01:22:20,290
It's at 35 Celsius.

2152
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:25,430
Alright, 319.

2153
01:22:25,510 --> 01:22:30,070
How much do I need to like buy this fancy espresso?

2154
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:34,110
I need like $500 for the fancy espresso.

2155
01:22:34,630 --> 01:22:38,070
Oh, but I could get like a coffee filter and open new recipes.

2156
01:22:38,610 --> 01:22:39,070
Oh!

2157
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:40,750
Wait, isn't that...

2158
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:41,710
Oh!

2159
01:22:42,010 --> 01:22:43,150
I got one!

2160
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:44,370
It's okay.

2161
01:22:44,470 --> 01:22:47,810
One of them might not be as good anymore, but that's okay.

2162
01:22:49,550 --> 01:22:52,750
Then we're gonna pick that up and put that here.

2163
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:58,190
I do not get paid to smile.

2164
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:02,430
That's extra.

2165
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:04,670
Okay.

2166
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:09,190
Extra hot coffee.

2167
01:23:10,990 --> 01:23:11,170
Okay.

2168
01:23:12,270 --> 01:23:12,910
Coffee.

2169
01:23:13,770 --> 01:23:15,610
Oh wait, I can like rotate it.

2170
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:23,090
Now I'm angry, sad.

2171
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:30,010
If you want me to smile, that's extra.

2172
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:32,110
That's...

2173
01:23:32,110 --> 01:23:33,210
That's extra.

2174
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,250
Oh my god.

2175
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:36,350
Please.

2176
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:39,330
Why can't this machine be faster?

2177
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:42,290
Okay.

2178
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:46,870
Guys, if I was happy, I would not be a barista right now.

2179
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:55,840
Please.

2180
01:23:56,420 --> 01:23:56,860
Okay.

2181
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:58,360
Let's see.

2182
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,200
We fill it up.

2183
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,060
All right.

2184
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:03,340
This is fine.

2185
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,180
This is fine.

2186
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:04,860
We're making money.

2187
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:06,000
We're making good progress.

2188
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,560
This is absolutely fine.

2189
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:09,460
Yeah, he's happy.

2190
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:09,940
Okay.

2191
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:10,980
All right.

2192
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:12,280
My reviews are back to 80.

2193
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,720
Best place I've ever seen.

2194
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:15,020
When you want.

2195
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:15,460
Okay.

2196
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:16,320
That's it.

2197
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:16,500
That's two.

2198
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:17,920
How much more?

2199
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:18,220
Okay.

2200
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,060
I need to put more coffee in here.

2201
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:21,680
Give me a sec, ma'am.

2202
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:23,840
I need to put more coffee in the... in this grinder.

2203
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:25,420
It's okay.

2204
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,240
We ordered two.

2205
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:27,380
So we should have enough.

2206
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:27,760
Right?

2207
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:28,740
All right.

2208
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:30,320
Nice.

2209
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:30,700
Okay.

2210
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:31,760
That's fine.

2211
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:32,820
We're fine.

2212
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:33,820
Everything's fine.

2213
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:39,940
Guys, I know like we haven't made any like actual profit and we're still investing in the store, but that's okay.

2214
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:41,300
It's a long game here.

2215
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:46,300
Um, and then, um, we got to put this away.

2216
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,520
And then put this in.

2217
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:53,580
And put that in here.

2218
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,900
And I still have plenty of shot glasses, guys.

2219
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:58,320
Bam!

2220
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,420
There we go!

2221
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:01,180
Oh, wait.

2222
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,480
I should pour the rest of this coffee in here too.

2223
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,380
Uh, all right.

2224
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:07,320
All right.

2225
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:07,700
That's fine.

2226
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:08,060
Okay.

2227
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:08,760
What's your name?

2228
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:09,320
Eva.

2229
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,160
Get in.

2230
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:13,920
Oh, what the fuck?

2231
01:25:13,940 --> 01:25:14,540
That's your twin.

2232
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,040
Wait.

2233
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:16,280
What?

2234
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:16,620
What the fuck?

2235
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:16,980
Triplets?

2236
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:17,700
Wait.

2237
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:18,420
They're all the...

2238
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,020
Wait.

2239
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:19,420
What?

2240
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:20,820
Wait.

2241
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:23,320
Okay.

2242
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,660
There's a glitch in the matrix.

2243
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:25,480
There is.

2244
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,840
I think there's a glitch in the matrix, guys.

2245
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:38,440
All right.

2246
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:39,780
Um.

2247
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,020
It's okay.

2248
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:43,400
It's okay.

2249
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,660
One of the triplets is having a good time.

2250
01:25:45,660 --> 01:25:47,120
One of the triplets got their order.

2251
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,120
Why did you line up on my side?

2252
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,320
We have a barista.

2253
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:51,780
All right.

2254
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:53,780
Okay.

2255
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:54,840
Um.

2256
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:56,560
Wait.

2257
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:57,900
Did you...

2258
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:58,940
Um.

2259
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:00,300
Wait.

2260
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,400
Whose coffee is this?

2261
01:26:01,940 --> 01:26:03,100
Is this your coffee?

2262
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:04,120
Wait.

2263
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,760
Then whose coffee is this?

2264
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:07,000
Wait.

2265
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:08,460
I'm so...

2266
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,600
Why do I have...

2267
01:26:10,180 --> 01:26:11,020
Why do I have two?

2268
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,220
I'm so...

2269
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:17,300
Why do I have...

2270
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:17,940
Why do I...

2271
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,120
Why do I have two cups?

2272
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:20,160
I don't know.

2273
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:22,040
I don't know why I have two cups.

2274
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:22,440
Okay.

2275
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:23,140
That's...

2276
01:26:23,140 --> 01:26:24,400
That's a lot of shots.

2277
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:24,900
Okay.

2278
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:29,120
And then we put that in here.

2279
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:32,740
And then we fill this up.

2280
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:35,300
But like when did I...

2281
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:36,260
When did I have a...

2282
01:26:36,260 --> 01:26:37,500
When did I have a second...

2283
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:39,100
A second one?

2284
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:40,260
When...

2285
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,040
When did I...

2286
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:43,380
Guys, my brain is breaking.

2287
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:44,740
When did that happen?

2288
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:45,640
I don't remember.

2289
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:46,080
Okay.

2290
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:47,200
We're going to get the expensive one.

2291
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:47,300
Okay.

2292
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:47,540
We're going to get the expensive one.

2293
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:51,360
We can afford the expensive espresso machine.

2294
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:54,940
We need the expensive...

2295
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:55,820
This is faster.

2296
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,980
What does he want?

2297
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:03,300
He also wants an espresso and this is a triplo.

2298
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,840
So like I need two shot glasses.

2299
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:09,860
I have more shot glasses in here.

2300
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,180
Okay.

2301
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:12,460
Everything's fine.

2302
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:14,400
Everything...

2303
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:14,600
Wait.

2304
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:15,400
Why is he angry?

2305
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:17,280
Okay.

2306
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:17,600
I don't understand.

2307
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,040
Why are you angry?

2308
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:19,540
Why are you angry?

2309
01:27:20,160 --> 01:27:20,760
What...

2310
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:21,940
What did I do?

2311
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:22,840
I...

2312
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,660
I don't understand.

2313
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,020
Why was he angry?

2314
01:27:29,500 --> 01:27:31,220
He didn't want to wait.

2315
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,140
We have two lines.

2316
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:38,900
Okay.

2317
01:27:41,300 --> 01:27:42,860
Sarah, please don't be angry.

2318
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:44,140
I'm just an anime girl.

2319
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,670
Sarah, please.

2320
01:27:50,730 --> 01:27:51,070
Why are you angry?

2321
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:54,170
Please don't be angry, this anime girl is gonna cry!

2322
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:04,360
Let's see what we need.

2323
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,100
Okay, and now we got press 2.

2324
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:13,300
Please, please Nathan, please!

2325
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:15,560
I'm trying my best, Nathan!

2326
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,700
Nathan, please don't be angry at me!

2327
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:24,060
I'm gonna cry!

2328
01:28:31,300 --> 01:28:33,260
Your cafe is starting to get dirty.

2329
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:34,560
What do you want me to do?

2330
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:35,700
I'm just one person!

2331
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:36,840
It's just me and Liam!

2332
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,520
If you don't like it, just leave!

2333
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:42,220
Just leave my cafe!

2334
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:43,980
I already have too many customers!

2335
01:28:44,520 --> 01:28:46,080
I have too many customers!

2336
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:48,660
I don't need all of you here!

2337
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:50,280
Okay.

2338
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:53,360
Okay.

2339
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:57,520
We got this.

2340
01:28:58,460 --> 01:28:58,820
Alright.

2341
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,620
Oh wait, did I pour everything in?

2342
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:04,140
Okay, I think I did.

2343
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:04,520
Okay.

2344
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:06,840
Oh, thank God!

2345
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:07,480
Alright, what do you want?

2346
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,540
You want an espresso?

2347
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:09,960
Okay, the espresso is easy!

2348
01:29:11,220 --> 01:29:12,020
Expresso is easy!

2349
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:12,440
Okay.

2350
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:15,980
Alright, we gotta fill it up!

2351
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:17,940
We gotta fill it up!

2352
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:19,300
What day is it today?

2353
01:29:19,300 --> 01:29:20,400
3, 4, 5, 6, 7...

2354
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,380
Oh my god, there's still 4 more hours of work!

2355
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:24,120
There's still... Okay, that's okay.

2356
01:29:24,400 --> 01:29:25,620
What did you want?

2357
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:28,100
That's... That's 1.

2358
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,540
1.

2359
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:28,900
Okay.

2360
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:29,420
Boom.

2361
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:33,280
Oh, our other... Our other one is here.

2362
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,020
It's okay, we have... We have...

2363
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:38,220
We have the better coffee machine!

2364
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,800
Okay, we're gonna put the better coffee machine here.

2365
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:43,060
Alright, nice.

2366
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:46,360
And then... We're gonna put that here.

2367
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,040
And then...

2368
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:50,640
Are you... Oh shit!

2369
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,940
What's your name, sir?

2370
01:29:51,940 --> 01:29:52,700
Nathan!

2371
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Don't worry, Nathan!

2372
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:56,420
Asshole.

2373
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,440
There we go.

2374
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,500
That's you.

2375
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,580
That's fucking right, Nathan.

2376
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:01,340
I called you out.

2377
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:02,360
I called you out.

2378
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,300
You made me wanna cry.

2379
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:09,680
That's fucking right.

2380
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:10,780
I hope you know what you are.

2381
01:30:11,080 --> 01:30:12,100
Alright, espresso.

2382
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,400
I wanna use my new machine!

2383
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:16,820
Okay, how do I use my new machine?

2384
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:19,680
Wait, it's still 30?

2385
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:22,880
Wait, do I have no more?

2386
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,160
Wait, what?

2387
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,960
Is there no more in there?

2388
01:30:31,950 --> 01:30:32,710
Is that it?

2389
01:30:34,510 --> 01:30:35,670
Is that actually it?

2390
01:30:37,950 --> 01:30:40,570
Wait, how do I... How do I put this on?

2391
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:43,170
What the fuck?

2392
01:30:43,210 --> 01:30:44,550
What did you do, Liam?

2393
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:49,270
I'm so confused.

2394
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:50,870
Wait.

2395
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:53,350
They're not grind... Oh, I didn't grind it yet!

2396
01:30:54,870 --> 01:30:55,270
Okay.

2397
01:30:55,890 --> 01:30:56,550
Fill it.

2398
01:30:57,590 --> 01:30:59,130
And I'll fill the rest of this here.

2399
01:30:59,850 --> 01:31:01,370
And then... um...

2400
01:31:02,170 --> 01:31:04,210
How do I... put it on?

2401
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:08,780
How do I put this on?

2402
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:11,980
Oh, there it is.

2403
01:31:12,220 --> 01:31:13,100
Wait, where's my other...

2404
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,700
Wait, what happened to my other... grinder?

2405
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,620
Wait, where did my electric grinder go?

2406
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:20,940
Did it glitch out?

2407
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:23,980
Wait!

2408
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,380
My electric grinder's gone!

2409
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:44,630
My electric grinder!

2410
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:48,240
No!

2411
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,460
Oh my god.

2412
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,700
Oh, it's in my inventory.

2413
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:54,820
Oh, thank god.

2414
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,920
I was gonna freak out.

2415
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:56,700
I was actually...

2416
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,740
Not to do this again!

2417
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:59,540
It refunded my car!

2418
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:01,600
Liam, you fucker!

2419
01:32:03,780 --> 01:32:04,300
No!

2420
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:04,820
Liam!

2421
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:07,080
Sir?

2422
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:10,260
Oh no, I don't have enough beans!

2423
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:11,620
Do I have enough beans?

2424
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:12,780
Oh, I do.

2425
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,700
Oh my god, Liam sabotaged...

2426
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:16,920
I can't do this again!

2427
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:18,960
Okay.

2428
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:21,400
Guys, guys, please.

2429
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:22,200
I'm sorry.

2430
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:22,760
I...

2431
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,220
Oh no, my reviews.

2432
01:32:25,420 --> 01:32:25,780
Okay.

2433
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,540
I need more coffee.

2434
01:32:29,560 --> 01:32:30,780
No, I will get through you.

2435
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:32,660
Um, please, give up.

2436
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:33,860
Why are you crying?

2437
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:35,660
I'm gonna be crying first before you.

2438
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:36,600
Like...

2439
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:37,280
Hahaha!

2440
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:38,720
Hahaha!

2441
01:32:38,860 --> 01:32:38,880
Hahaha!

2442
01:32:40,700 --> 01:32:42,460
Like, why are you crying?

2443
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:45,520
Is it... does it finish grinding?

2444
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,060
Is it done?

2445
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,440
Oh, I think it's done.

2446
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:49,800
Okay.

2447
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:51,860
Okay, and then we'll fill this.

2448
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:53,820
I think that's 30 at that point.

2449
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:56,520
No, do I not have enough?

2450
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:58,400
Do I...

2451
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,040
Do I not have enough in there?

2452
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:02,160
Do I...

2453
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,460
Do I not have enough?

2454
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:07,360
What happened?

2455
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:08,120
Okay.

2456
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:10,860
Um, and then...

2457
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,280
What did you want?

2458
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:14,240
You wanted triplo.

2459
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:16,600
Oh...

2460
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,300
Um...

2461
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:18,820
I'm sorry, I'm...

2462
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,100
Please, Liam!

2463
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:20,760
Please!

2464
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:21,760
Leave me alone!

2465
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:22,600
Liam!

2466
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:23,660
Liam!

2467
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:25,640
Leave me alone!

2468
01:33:26,680 --> 01:33:27,960
What are you...

2469
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:28,360
Liam...

2470
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:30,500
Stop, Liam!

2471
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:34,680
There's nothing in there!

2472
01:33:34,740 --> 01:33:36,000
Why is there nothing in there?

2473
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:39,120
Why is there...

2474
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:40,260
Why is there water?

2475
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:41,960
Is there anything...

2476
01:33:41,960 --> 01:33:42,300
What?

2477
01:33:44,180 --> 01:33:44,700
What?

2478
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:45,820
Why is there water?

2479
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,200
I thought I put...

2480
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,300
Oh my god!

2481
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:49,980
I thought I...

2482
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,680
I'm sorry, please, sir.

2483
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:52,700
I don't have coffee.

2484
01:33:52,740 --> 01:33:53,260
I'm sorry.

2485
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:54,740
I ran out of coffee.

2486
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,300
I ran out of coffee.

2487
01:33:58,440 --> 01:33:59,440
I'm sorry.

2488
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:03,120
Okay.

2489
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:04,280
Alright.

2490
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:07,340
Please, if you can wait 25 more seconds.

2491
01:34:08,240 --> 01:34:08,720
Please.

2492
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,360
Things are getting really out of hand.

2493
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,080
If you can wait 25 more seconds, please.

2494
01:34:15,340 --> 01:34:17,300
Wait, the other garbage bag is gone.

2495
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:18,840
Oh, it works!

2496
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:20,000
We just leave it outside.

2497
01:34:23,540 --> 01:34:24,020
Please.

2498
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,200
Please, sir.

2499
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,120
Let me...

2500
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:27,000
Do you want to talk?

2501
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:27,640
Sir?

2502
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,360
Like, if we talk, then like, things can be fine.

2503
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:32,940
Cargo arrived.

2504
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,260
Oh my god, we have more coffee.

2505
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:34,940
We have more coffee.

2506
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:35,800
Oh, that's so good.

2507
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:36,340
We have...

2508
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:36,900
We actually...

2509
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:37,320
We have...

2510
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:38,140
We actually have more coffee.

2511
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:39,300
Oh, alright.

2512
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:40,420
Um...

2513
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:42,720
And then we gotta place all our coffee here.

2514
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:44,180
Place all...

2515
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:45,040
And then...

2516
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:46,440
Um...

2517
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,180
Um...

2518
01:34:47,180 --> 01:34:48,360
Where's our grinder?

2519
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,100
Okay, we fill our grinder up.

2520
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:50,620
Please, sir.

2521
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,100
Just wait...

2522
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:52,360
Just wait a little bit longer.

2523
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:53,660
Please don't leave.

2524
01:34:56,380 --> 01:34:57,500
Please don't leave.

2525
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:04,880
Sir, please.

2526
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:05,980
Please, just...

2527
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:07,600
Just wait like five more minutes, sir.

2528
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:09,120
I'm doing my best.

2529
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,040
I'm...

2530
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:11,260
I'm doing my absolute best.

2531
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,340
I'm doing my absolute best right now.

2532
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:14,640
Okay, and then...

2533
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:17,800
Then we're gonna put these here.

2534
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,660
And I think it's done filling.

2535
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,000
Okay, and then we're gonna fill it up here.

2536
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,860
And I'm just gonna keep blending it.

2537
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:30,540
I think that worked.

2538
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:38,020
And grind, grind, grind, and it was triplo, right?

2539
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:38,880
Triplo.

2540
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:39,240
Okay.

2541
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:39,440
Okay.

2542
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:42,300
I think I'm wearing shot glasses here.

2543
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:44,620
And here we go.

2544
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:45,780
Boom!

2545
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:48,880
We're making coffee!

2546
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:53,040
Please, just stay with us for a little longer.

2547
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,440
Please just stay with us a little longer.

2548
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:56,940
I'm gonna write your name.

2549
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:57,420
What's your name?

2550
01:35:57,500 --> 01:35:57,800
Herman!

2551
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,900
Herman, that's your name.

2552
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,880
Alright, there you go.

2553
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,280
Is it filled?

2554
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:10,620
Okay.

2555
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,760
We filled this up.

2556
01:36:15,180 --> 01:36:16,220
We filled this up.

2557
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:17,600
Herman, please stay with me.

2558
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,000
Stay with me a little longer.

2559
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,120
How is this faster?

2560
01:36:20,380 --> 01:36:21,780
This is not faster at all.

2561
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:22,240
Please.

2562
01:36:22,460 --> 01:36:23,560
How is this faster?

2563
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:24,180
Herman!

2564
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,080
Herman's still here!

2565
01:36:25,240 --> 01:36:26,400
Herman's still with us!

2566
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:31,620
Herman's still with us!

2567
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:32,400
Thank you, Herman!

2568
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:36,900
Happy customer!

2569
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:38,300
Alright.

2570
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,900
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

2571
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,920
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

2572
01:36:43,460 --> 01:36:44,980
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

2573
01:36:45,460 --> 01:36:46,320
Okay.

2574
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,920
And then... garbage.

2575
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:50,580
Boop.

2576
01:36:50,740 --> 01:36:51,540
Alright.

2577
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:52,860
Nice.

2578
01:36:58,590 --> 01:37:03,370
Guys, I think opening a coffee shop was a mistake.

2579
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:04,580
I think...

2580
01:37:08,710 --> 01:37:14,390
Guys, I don't think this was the right idea.

2581
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:21,610
I don't think this was the right idea.

2582
01:37:21,610 --> 01:37:23,230
Let me clean this first before.

2583
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:24,430
Okay.

2584
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:25,870
I cleaned this.

2585
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:27,810
And then I will put you here.

2586
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:32,330
And then I cleaned... I cleaned this.

2587
01:37:33,490 --> 01:37:35,670
And... oh, the container's full already?

2588
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:36,330
Okay.

2589
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:38,670
I need to pick it up.

2590
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:39,730
Throw it in.

2591
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:41,130
And...

2592
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:42,570
And then...

2593
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,250
Clean...

2594
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:46,330
Clean.

2595
01:37:48,010 --> 01:37:50,110
Okay, and then I need to...

2596
01:37:52,110 --> 01:37:52,630
Guys...

2597
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:56,250
Guys, I don't think anybody, any of us are going back to college.

2598
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:56,850
I don't...

2599
01:37:58,490 --> 01:38:01,350
I need, I need a filter machine.

2600
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:03,350
I need to buy that.

2601
01:38:05,810 --> 01:38:10,110
And I'm gonna... I bought a filter, so now we have more recipes.

2602
01:38:10,850 --> 01:38:12,530
We got filtered coffee!

2603
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:12,930
Coffee!

2604
01:38:14,650 --> 01:38:22,990
Made by brewing hot water over coffee grounds and letting the resulting drip through a filter.

2605
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:25,050
How do you do that?

2606
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:28,470
How do you, how do you, how do you do that?

2607
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:33,910
What, what does that mean?

2608
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:37,950
Guys, I want to upgrade.

2609
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:41,170
I want to get a bathroom, guys.

2610
01:38:45,710 --> 01:38:49,090
Guys, I think my plan, it's perfect.

2611
01:38:51,790 --> 01:38:55,550
I'm gonna have you guys, I'm gonna have you guys...

2612
01:38:55,970 --> 01:39:03,850
None of you guys are getting colleges, so you're forced to work here in my coffee shop until we pay things off.

2613
01:39:04,270 --> 01:39:06,030
Until I don't...

2614
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:09,330
Hmm.

2615
01:39:13,170 --> 01:39:17,310
Oh my god, I can increase the cargo price and then...

2616
01:39:17,310 --> 01:39:20,130
Let's see, more customers will leave positive reviews.

2617
01:39:20,390 --> 01:39:23,550
Oh my god, I can buy more bots to leave positive reviews on my store?

2618
01:39:23,890 --> 01:39:25,390
Wait, that sounds great!

2619
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:26,810
Um...

2620
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:27,830
Let's see.

2621
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:30,570
What's a thousand connector?

2622
01:39:30,930 --> 01:39:33,930
Your cafe can work one additional...

2623
01:39:33,930 --> 01:39:35,410
No, that is okay.

2624
01:39:35,670 --> 01:39:37,730
I already work too much here.

2625
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:38,450
I...

2626
01:39:41,570 --> 01:39:42,290
That's okay.

2627
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:46,690
I think I work more than enough in this cafe.

2628
01:39:47,190 --> 01:39:52,830
I'm just gonna sit here to wait for our shop to give me more stuff.

2629
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,700
Oh my god.

2630
01:40:01,220 --> 01:40:03,180
Now, now I know why.

2631
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,500
Now, now I know why.

2632
01:40:09,640 --> 01:40:11,360
Oh my god.

2633
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:16,360
Oh, now I know why people were like, Like, this game is really stressful.

2634
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,800
Now I understand.

2635
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:22,400
I laughed about it.

2636
01:40:22,580 --> 01:40:24,300
But oh my god.

2637
01:40:24,380 --> 01:40:26,620
Why did I laugh about it?

2638
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,920
Okay, I want most important materials.

2639
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:30,700
I want a coffee shop.

2640
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:32,800
Alright, how do I do this?

2641
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:34,020
Coffee grind.

2642
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:36,020
Coffee filter paper.

2643
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:38,280
What?

2644
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:42,970
What?

2645
01:40:42,970 --> 01:40:43,210
What?

2646
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:45,990
Do I just...

2647
01:40:46,970 --> 01:40:47,870
pour?

2648
01:40:49,010 --> 01:40:50,810
I pour this.

2649
01:40:51,130 --> 01:40:52,490
I pour that.

2650
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:55,690
And then...

2651
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:57,210
pour?

2652
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:01,400
Pour?

2653
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,240
What?

2654
01:41:07,460 --> 01:41:08,500
Pour?

2655
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:12,320
Filter paper?

2656
01:41:14,220 --> 01:41:15,740
Filter paper?

2657
01:41:19,340 --> 01:41:21,040
Oh filter paper!

2658
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:26,660
I'm so confused.

2659
01:41:28,400 --> 01:41:30,000
I need...

2660
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,380
My cat needs to sleep!

2661
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,800
I need to pour more beans though.

2662
01:41:40,580 --> 01:41:42,380
Oh, because it's already crushed.

2663
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:43,500
Alright.

2664
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,580
Alright guys, we gotta...

2665
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,980
No, we don't have material.

2666
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,780
Okay, we're gonna sleep a little bit.

2667
01:41:50,820 --> 01:41:52,480
We're gonna sleep until 6.

2668
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:55,200
So then we have time to figure this out.

2669
01:41:56,220 --> 01:41:57,280
Alright, save.

2670
01:41:58,380 --> 01:41:58,680
Save.

2671
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:01,520
And then...

2672
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,160
We're gonna sleep...

2673
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:04,600
2 hours?

2674
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:06,600
2 hours.

2675
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:09,180
Alright, that should be enough.

2676
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:11,480
Oh, our stuff has arrived!

2677
01:42:11,860 --> 01:42:12,280
Nice!

2678
01:42:13,540 --> 01:42:15,840
Oh my god, it's only day 3.

2679
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:16,960
It's only...

2680
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:19,340
We should not have had 3 wifi.

2681
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:20,340
We should not.

2682
01:42:22,180 --> 01:42:25,000
Free wifi was a mistake.

2683
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:26,620
Um...

2684
01:42:26,620 --> 01:42:28,520
Where did the filter paper go?

2685
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:30,200
Filter paper?

2686
01:42:31,220 --> 01:42:32,460
Oh, filter paper!

2687
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,280
Okay, and then...

2688
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:35,120
Coffee?

2689
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:38,720
And then...

2690
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:41,100
Bean?

2691
01:42:41,740 --> 01:42:42,440
No?

2692
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,740
Bean don't go inside?

2693
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,000
Bean?

2694
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,540
Oh!

2695
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:49,460
Oh!

2696
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:49,780
Oh!

2697
01:42:49,780 --> 01:42:50,140
Oh!

2698
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:50,360
Oh!

2699
01:42:53,060 --> 01:42:53,740
Bean...

2700
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:58,320
Yes, I figured it out.

2701
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:00,920
Yes, I figured it out.

2702
01:43:00,940 --> 01:43:01,540
Guys...

2703
01:43:01,540 --> 01:43:03,540
I figured out where the beans go.

2704
01:43:03,900 --> 01:43:06,380
I figured out where the beans go.

2705
01:43:06,820 --> 01:43:09,300
Oh my god, we already got a big coffee!

2706
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:09,600
Coffee!

2707
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:11,700
Okay, grind.

2708
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:15,020
We have to watch this grind now.

2709
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:16,640
We still have lots of time.

2710
01:43:17,540 --> 01:43:18,180
Alright.

2711
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:23,060
I became bad at language.

2712
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:23,940
Because...

2713
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:28,660
Because paper is just really hard.

2714
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:33,600
I didn't know... Wait, do I need water?

2715
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:36,780
Do I need water in the coffee mug?

2716
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:39,800
Or is that good to go?

2717
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,160
Are we good to go?

2718
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:43,560
Do I need water?

2719
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:45,700
Oh my god, okay.

2720
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:48,460
How do I fill it up?

2721
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,540
I fill it up with shot glasses?

2722
01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:51,460
No?

2723
01:43:53,180 --> 01:43:54,140
How do I...

2724
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,280
How do you fill up water?

2725
01:43:58,360 --> 01:43:59,460
Water go where?

2726
01:44:02,840 --> 01:44:03,320
Water...

2727
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:05,740
Water...

2728
01:44:06,820 --> 01:44:07,700
Um...

2729
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:10,660
Water...

2730
01:44:10,660 --> 01:44:12,900
Why is water not going?

2731
01:44:14,060 --> 01:44:14,940
What?

2732
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,600
Water please...

2733
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,840
Why is...

2734
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:19,740
Why can't I fill it up?

2735
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:21,280
Water machine?

2736
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,380
Water?

2737
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:29,600
Water machine?

2738
01:44:30,660 --> 01:44:31,100
What?

2739
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:32,960
Um...

2740
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:34,520
Maybe if I...

2741
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:35,940
Um...

2742
01:44:36,780 --> 01:44:37,800
Maybe...

2743
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,180
Uh...

2744
01:44:40,780 --> 01:44:41,960
Water here?

2745
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:42,900
No?

2746
01:44:45,540 --> 01:44:47,080
Read the recipe.

2747
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:58,500
Filter coffee is made by pouring hot water over coffee grounds and letting the resulting brew drip through...

2748
01:44:58,500 --> 01:44:59,000
What?

2749
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:01,520
What?

2750
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:05,520
I need a kettle!

2751
01:45:07,240 --> 01:45:08,700
You need a kettle?

2752
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:12,600
Are you fucking...

2753
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:14,540
Okay, you can fill it while it's here.

2754
01:45:14,660 --> 01:45:15,880
It has a large...

2755
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:17,320
Most coffee calls...

2756
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,220
You need this machine.

2757
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

2758
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:21,040
Are you...

2759
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:22,100
Okay.

2760
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:23,140
Alright.

2761
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,660
I need a kettle.

2762
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:28,380
It didn't tell me I need a kettle when we had the recipe!

2763
01:45:34,080 --> 01:45:37,020
As no one comes to the coffee shop expecting it to be clean.

2764
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:40,820
That's all I'm gonna say.

2765
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:50,100
No, all I drink is canned coffee.

2766
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,640
Guys, don't make me bring this right now.

2767
01:45:57,540 --> 01:46:03,820
I swear to God if I hear one more critique on my store.

2768
01:46:03,980 --> 01:46:05,600
I swear to God, Nathan.

2769
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:07,060
I swear to fucking God.

2770
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:10,080
I'll do it.

2771
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:11,600
I'll fucking do it.

2772
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:13,640
Espresso... okay.

2773
01:46:14,220 --> 01:46:16,800
Um... alright, let's see.

2774
01:46:17,120 --> 01:46:20,220
We need to... alright.

2775
01:46:20,360 --> 01:46:22,020
We gotta grab that here.

2776
01:46:22,860 --> 01:46:24,400
And then... poop.

2777
01:46:24,720 --> 01:46:26,680
And then we gotta grab that here.

2778
01:46:27,540 --> 01:46:29,220
And this here.

2779
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:31,040
Bam.

2780
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,420
Alright, and then...

2781
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:35,020
What's your name again?

2782
01:46:35,020 --> 01:46:36,340
What's your name?

2783
01:46:36,500 --> 01:46:36,840
Nathan.

2784
01:46:37,780 --> 01:46:38,260
Okay.

2785
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:41,440
Tip me, please.

2786
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:49,130
Or... I'll... cry.

2787
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:54,510
Oh yeah, you had two orders.

2788
01:46:54,590 --> 01:46:55,390
Give me a sec.

2789
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:04,860
Alright, there you go.

2790
01:47:05,660 --> 01:47:06,520
Two orders.

2791
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:07,960
I think that one's done.

2792
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:10,000
Okay.

2793
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:16,280
And then...

2794
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,500
That's your order.

2795
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,420
And then this is also your order.

2796
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:23,300
Right here.

2797
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:27,040
That pour in the ca- okay, I thought I poured it in another shot glass.

2798
01:47:27,380 --> 01:47:28,700
Because I've done that before.

2799
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:30,480
Bam!

2800
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:31,920
Alright, what do you want?

2801
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:33,040
You want an espresso.

2802
01:47:33,380 --> 01:47:34,020
Oh, an espresso!

2803
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:35,880
That's easy to do.

2804
01:47:36,940 --> 01:47:39,940
Oh, I can't find an easier way for this.

2805
01:47:40,500 --> 01:47:41,480
An espresso.

2806
01:47:41,500 --> 01:47:41,980
Heart.

2807
01:47:41,980 --> 01:47:42,140
Alright.

2808
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,780
Don't worry, I got you.

2809
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:46,820
It would be nice if this should tip my coffee.

2810
01:47:46,980 --> 01:47:49,240
Thank you for the super chat.

2811
01:47:49,460 --> 01:47:50,420
Thank you, thank you.

2812
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:51,780
Oh, I should have a kettle now!

2813
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:52,980
I have a kettle!

2814
01:47:54,580 --> 01:47:55,920
Guys, I got a kettle!

2815
01:47:56,820 --> 01:47:57,940
How do I do this?

2816
01:47:58,160 --> 01:47:58,560
Okay.

2817
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,100
And then I just pour the water.

2818
01:48:02,580 --> 01:48:03,920
Okay, that seems easy.

2819
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:05,920
Fill.

2820
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:10,040
Alright, let's fill this with 350 right off the bat.

2821
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,980
You forgot my- Nathan!

2822
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,440
Nathan, leave!

2823
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:15,660
Leave the store!

2824
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:20,180
You'll come back anyway because I'm the closest coffee shop to your house.

2825
01:48:22,740 --> 01:48:26,960
I could treat you like this because you're not gonna walk another block for your coffee.

2826
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:30,220
You know you need this store more than this store needs you.

2827
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:39,060
Alright, let's see what's for her.

2828
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:41,640
Alright, here you go.

2829
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,060
And then we're gonna put this on the stove.

2830
01:48:45,160 --> 01:48:46,240
And then, poof.

2831
01:48:46,420 --> 01:48:47,080
Alright, what do you want?

2832
01:48:47,100 --> 01:48:48,900
Why are you on my line?!

2833
01:48:48,900 --> 01:48:53,320
We don't have medium- There's medium coffee cups now?!

2834
01:48:54,740 --> 01:48:57,480
We have other sizes?!

2835
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,200
No, we have other sizes.

2836
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:02,580
Why are you crying?

2837
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:04,220
Why are you crying?

2838
01:49:04,340 --> 01:49:05,860
Oh, because you don't have much to live?

2839
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:08,960
And you're wasting the majority of your remaining license?

2840
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:11,080
You're just standing here waiting for your fucking coffee?!

2841
01:49:11,080 --> 01:49:11,560
Good!

2842
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:17,080
Wait, does it have beans?

2843
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:19,600
Does it have- Yeah, it does.

2844
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:20,680
Okay, it does have beans.

2845
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:22,400
Um, mini espresso.

2846
01:49:23,540 --> 01:49:24,060
Yay!

2847
01:49:24,500 --> 01:49:24,880
Alright.

2848
01:49:26,760 --> 01:49:28,180
Um... let's see.

2849
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:30,040
Here we go.

2850
01:49:30,140 --> 01:49:31,040
And then...

2851
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,780
We gotta pick it up.

2852
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,000
Wait, I thought they're not?

2853
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:35,520
Is it ready?

2854
01:49:35,960 --> 01:49:37,520
Container- Oh, container's full!

2855
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,160
Okay, let's pick that up.

2856
01:49:40,540 --> 01:49:42,920
And then... we'll put that here.

2857
01:49:43,740 --> 01:49:45,320
And... we have $95?!

2858
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,180
What did I spend?!

2859
01:49:46,180 --> 01:49:48,320
Oh, I spent it on... Oh, I remember.

2860
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,340
I spent it on...

2861
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:52,580
Uh... I spent it on... uh...

2862
01:49:52,580 --> 01:49:53,520
More cups.

2863
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:56,820
Only I'm allowed- Exactly.

2864
01:49:57,100 --> 01:49:59,760
Only I'm allowed to cry in my coffee shop.

2865
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:04,500
You think you're better than me just because you're here using my services?!

2866
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:06,720
Okay.

2867
01:50:06,720 --> 01:50:07,280
Um...

2868
01:50:07,520 --> 01:50:08,000
What's your name?

2869
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:08,640
Lola!

2870
01:50:09,140 --> 01:50:09,660
Lola!

2871
01:50:10,700 --> 01:50:11,820
Hello, Lola!

2872
01:50:12,080 --> 01:50:17,140
This is the one time you- I gave a normal name on this- on this coffee cup.

2873
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:18,080
Alright.

2874
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,100
Alright, here you go.

2875
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:22,080
Let's sh- Alright.

2876
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:23,480
Alright, Lola.

2877
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:24,600
Oh, hello, Granny.

2878
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:26,520
You want filtered coffee?

2879
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:27,860
I don't even have a small!

2880
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:31,340
Oh my gosh, it's 30 more seconds.

2881
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,420
Um...

2882
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:34,620
Um... Okay, we're gonna...

2883
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:36,400
Um...

2884
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,760
Wait, what does she want?

2885
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:38,920
Americano?

2886
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,780
I have an Americano?!

2887
01:50:41,480 --> 01:50:44,540
How the fuck do you make an Americano?!

2888
01:50:47,660 --> 01:50:48,880
Espresso and water.

2889
01:50:49,220 --> 01:50:51,360
Oh, okay, so you just want watered coffee.

2890
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,460
Okay.

2891
01:50:54,520 --> 01:50:55,980
Oh my god, I'm sorry!

2892
01:50:56,360 --> 01:50:57,240
I'm sorry!

2893
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:00,100
I don't have- Amazon's coming!

2894
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:01,100
Okay, thank god!

2895
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,620
Okay, Amazon's here.

2896
01:51:02,900 --> 01:51:03,380
Alright.

2897
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:05,100
Let's see.

2898
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,720
Alright, I have cups now.

2899
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:09,000
Um...

2900
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,740
Small coffee.

2901
01:51:11,660 --> 01:51:16,120
Okay, what do you- how do I- small filter- how do I make filtered coffee again?

2902
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:20,640
I- How do I- how do I make filtered coffee?

2903
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:25,980
Um, fil- filtered coffee, 236 milliliters.

2904
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:28,800
Oh!

2905
01:51:28,940 --> 01:51:29,460
No!

2906
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:31,380
That's not what I want!

2907
01:51:35,860 --> 01:51:37,220
Alright, let's see.

2908
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,360
Filtered coffee!

2909
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:40,720
Um...

2910
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,480
Lid?

2911
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:44,320
Um...

2912
01:51:45,120 --> 01:51:46,820
Is this- is this hot enough?

2913
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:49,440
It's still not hot enough?

2914
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,700
Wait, why is the water going down?

2915
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,060
Oh, it's evaporating!

2916
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:57,940
It's-

2917
01:52:01,600 --> 01:52:04,590
Wait - Oh...

2918
01:52:05,770 --> 01:52:06,810
How do I...

2919
01:52:07,530 --> 01:52:09,210
How do I put water inside?

2920
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:11,510
How do I...

2921
01:52:12,110 --> 01:52:13,210
How do I fill it?

2922
01:52:14,310 --> 01:52:15,130
Does that...

2923
01:52:15,630 --> 01:52:16,810
How do I...

2924
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:18,490
How do I...

2925
01:52:18,490 --> 01:52:19,830
How do I fill it?

2926
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:24,330
How do I fill it?

2927
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:26,610
How do I...

2928
01:52:27,470 --> 01:52:30,410
How do I fil- Fill the water!

2929
01:52:30,750 --> 01:52:32,390
How do I- how do I fill this?

2930
01:52:32,630 --> 01:52:34,270
How do I...

2931
01:52:39,710 --> 01:52:43,480
Is it filling?

2932
01:52:46,570 --> 01:52:47,770
Is it filling?

2933
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:53,250
Is it doing anything?

2934
01:52:56,870 --> 01:53:06,930
Is your coffee going in there?

2935
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:08,570
I can't tell.

2936
01:53:09,090 --> 01:53:10,150
It's just Steve.

2937
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:20,310
Coffee is going in!

2938
01:53:20,550 --> 01:53:21,730
Coffee is going in!

2939
01:53:22,110 --> 01:53:23,210
Oh my god, it's working!

2940
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:27,150
Okay, what do you want?

2941
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:28,650
Americano.

2942
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:31,810
Americano, you need...

2943
01:53:33,210 --> 01:53:35,230
At least Liam is picking up the slack.

2944
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:39,750
Americano.

2945
01:53:41,490 --> 01:53:44,490
Can I take it off of... okay.

2946
01:53:44,690 --> 01:53:45,790
What size?

2947
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:47,390
What size Americano?

2948
01:53:47,550 --> 01:53:48,430
Big!

2949
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:51,510
Why do you need a big Americano?

2950
01:53:54,070 --> 01:53:55,830
120 expresso.

2951
01:53:55,850 --> 01:53:58,630
120 expresso?!

2952
01:53:58,630 --> 01:53:59,630
Just leave.

2953
01:54:00,310 --> 01:54:02,470
Just leave my store.

2954
01:54:03,550 --> 01:54:04,430
Please.

2955
01:54:05,110 --> 01:54:05,990
Um...

2956
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,830
Small.

2957
01:54:07,090 --> 01:54:07,250
What?

2958
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:07,530
What?

2959
01:54:07,670 --> 01:54:07,730
What?

2960
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:09,830
How much small filtered coffee?

2961
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:11,270
Small.

2962
01:54:13,410 --> 01:54:14,370
354?!

2963
01:54:14,990 --> 01:54:15,970
I don't...

2964
01:54:17,930 --> 01:54:20,470
Do I have 354?

2965
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:23,330
I... I'm fucking...

2966
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:25,110
Leave.

2967
01:54:31,780 --> 01:54:35,560
That was my... NOOOOO!

2968
01:54:38,980 --> 01:54:40,160
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Ssssshhhh.

2969
01:54:55,390 --> 01:54:56,230
It's okay.

2970
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:58,070
I'll buy another review.

2971
01:55:02,530 --> 01:55:03,350
It's okay.

2972
01:55:03,590 --> 01:55:04,690
It's okay, guys.

2973
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:07,530
I bought another review to balance things out.

2974
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:08,770
It's okay.

2975
01:55:09,210 --> 01:55:10,610
It's okay, guys.

2976
01:55:11,450 --> 01:55:15,530
I bought another review so it's like it never happened.

2977
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:22,790
It's like it never happened guys.

2978
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:25,310
They beat me.

2979
01:55:25,690 --> 01:55:26,970
Five stars.

2980
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:29,710
Thanks guys for balancing it out.

2981
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:33,850
Wait, what is it?

2982
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:34,630
A mini.

2983
01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:35,970
Oh thank god it's a mini.

2984
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:37,390
Thank god.

2985
01:55:39,570 --> 01:55:42,710
Anytime I see a mini I'm like oh thank you.

2986
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:44,210
Oh thank you.

2987
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,530
Liam please move.

2988
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:47,910
I can't see.

2989
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:51,330
I can't see Liam.

2990
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:53,610
What's your name?

2991
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:55,110
Oh it's Lola you came back.

2992
01:55:55,910 --> 01:55:56,590
Lola.

2993
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:59,330
Lola you came back Lola.

2994
01:56:00,470 --> 01:56:01,150
Alright.

2995
01:56:02,970 --> 01:56:03,650
Lola.

2996
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:05,990
Lola is my best customer.

2997
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:08,710
I think Lola is the best one so far.

2998
01:56:08,990 --> 01:56:11,470
She likes being mistreated.

2999
01:56:12,150 --> 01:56:13,890
He's working Liam.

3000
01:56:14,210 --> 01:56:14,510
I'm alone.

3001
01:56:17,970 --> 01:56:19,370
Your cafe is starting to get dirty.

3002
01:56:19,490 --> 01:56:21,710
It's been like it's 84%.

3003
01:56:22,330 --> 01:56:24,630
That's like that's at least passable.

3004
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:27,570
By like the safety inspector.

3005
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:30,830
As long as the safety inspector does not complain.

3006
01:56:30,990 --> 01:56:32,410
I do not need to clean my cafe.

3007
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:34,050
I do not need to clean anything.

3008
01:56:35,190 --> 01:56:35,670
Alright.

3009
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:37,090
Let's see.

3010
01:56:37,270 --> 01:56:37,670
Okay.

3011
01:56:37,850 --> 01:56:38,570
That's good.

3012
01:56:40,530 --> 01:56:41,490
Okay Lola.

3013
01:56:41,810 --> 01:56:42,710
What do you want?

3014
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:43,770
You want a...

3015
01:56:44,210 --> 01:56:44,370
Oh my god.

3016
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:46,610
You left a cigarette box in my...

3017
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:47,470
Oh please.

3018
01:56:47,550 --> 01:56:49,290
How much do I need to do to upgrade?

3019
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:50,490
I need 200 more.

3020
01:56:50,690 --> 01:56:52,350
As soon as I get 200 dollars.

3021
01:56:52,610 --> 01:56:53,450
I can...

3022
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:56,210
I can have another barista I think.

3023
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:56,990
I think so.

3024
01:56:57,370 --> 01:56:58,830
Is that enough of an upgrade?

3025
01:57:00,810 --> 01:57:01,770
How much is security?

3026
01:57:02,410 --> 01:57:02,930
2500.

3027
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:05,250
Why would I need more security?

3028
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:08,870
Like why would I need more?

3029
01:57:08,970 --> 01:57:09,750
I don't understand.

3030
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:11,310
Okay.

3031
01:57:12,110 --> 01:57:12,550
Uh...

3032
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,190
Then we fill it up.

3033
01:57:14,530 --> 01:57:16,330
We need to grind some more coffee.

3034
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:18,290
Uh... alright.

3035
01:57:19,130 --> 01:57:20,350
Grind some coffee.

3036
01:57:20,890 --> 01:57:23,090
And then fill it up.

3037
01:57:23,090 --> 01:57:23,610
Fill it up.

3038
01:57:25,130 --> 01:57:25,850
Alright guys.

3039
01:57:25,970 --> 01:57:26,570
Give me a sec.

3040
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,470
Alright.

3041
01:57:29,550 --> 01:57:31,570
Like I don't understand why I need more security.

3042
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:32,930
Because I feel like...

3043
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:34,230
I feel like...

3044
01:57:34,230 --> 01:57:36,210
I haven't been robbed yet.

3045
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:38,310
Oh my god.

3046
01:57:38,330 --> 01:57:38,950
Am I gonna get robbed?

3047
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:41,290
Why would you want to rob this place?

3048
01:57:41,310 --> 01:57:43,210
I don't even have a working bathroom.

3049
01:57:43,750 --> 01:57:44,310
Like...

3050
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:46,130
What is there?

3051
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:47,570
What is there to rob?

3052
01:57:48,070 --> 01:57:50,290
I don't even have working toilets.

3053
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:55,870
I just have expensive overpriced coffee.

3054
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,730
This is worse than Supermarket Simulator.

3055
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:00,070
This is worse than Supermarket Simulator.

3056
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:00,770
I can't say it.

3057
01:58:00,850 --> 01:58:02,750
This is so much worse.

3058
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:06,310
Okay.

3059
01:58:06,850 --> 01:58:07,910
Oh my god.

3060
01:58:08,070 --> 01:58:09,990
I need to unlock the bathroom.

3061
01:58:11,530 --> 01:58:12,130
Alright.

3062
01:58:12,290 --> 01:58:12,770
Let's see.

3063
01:58:12,910 --> 01:58:14,050
We need to put this here.

3064
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:15,850
Put this here.

3065
01:58:16,210 --> 01:58:18,170
And then we're grabbing new shot glass.

3066
01:58:18,550 --> 01:58:19,210
Oh my god.

3067
01:58:19,230 --> 01:58:21,110
This isn't even a nice coffee.

3068
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:23,830
I literally bought the beans from Walmart.

3069
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:25,790
Why are you all still here?

3070
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:28,390
Who keeps leaving good reviews?

3071
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:31,990
I just wanted to be like an indie coffee shop.

3072
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:33,610
I just wanted to be like an indie coffee shop.

3073
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:34,390
I just wanted to be like an indie coffee shop.

3074
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:36,330
Why is there three of you now?

3075
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:36,950
Why is there three of you now?

3076
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:41,290
Who keeps recommending my coffee shop?

3077
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:44,610
It's supposed to be like indie.

3078
01:58:46,050 --> 01:58:47,630
We're supposed to be hipster.

3079
01:58:49,190 --> 01:58:49,750
Alright.

3080
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:50,430
Let's see.

3081
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:52,130
Oh no.

3082
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:53,570
I need...

3083
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:54,270
Okay.

3084
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,770
I need to grab...

3085
01:58:55,770 --> 01:58:57,050
Am I 16?

3086
01:58:57,210 --> 01:58:57,730
Not yet.

3087
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:58,110
Okay.

3088
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:00,590
Oh my god.

3089
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:03,810
Who keeps recommending us?

3090
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:05,050
What's your name?

3091
01:59:06,470 --> 01:59:07,450
What's your name?

3092
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:08,490
Um...

3093
01:59:10,610 --> 01:59:11,170
Betong.

3094
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:11,270
Betong.

3095
01:59:11,290 --> 01:59:11,410
Wait.

3096
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:12,050
Did you want Minnie?

3097
01:59:12,710 --> 01:59:13,150
Minnie.

3098
01:59:13,370 --> 01:59:13,650
Okay.

3099
01:59:14,750 --> 01:59:15,190
Uh...

3100
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:16,850
Leave.

3101
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:19,190
Okay.

3102
01:59:19,190 --> 01:59:19,630
Nice.

3103
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:20,030
Alright.

3104
01:59:20,130 --> 01:59:21,070
And then...

3105
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,370
Where's my other shot glass?

3106
01:59:22,410 --> 01:59:22,930
Here we go.

3107
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:23,950
Alright.

3108
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:26,150
There you go.

3109
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:26,570
Alright.

3110
01:59:26,630 --> 01:59:26,850
Pour.

3111
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:28,210
Word of mouth.

3112
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:29,050
Who keeps recommending?

3113
01:59:30,250 --> 01:59:30,690
Stop!

3114
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:33,450
Stop word of mouthing this coffee shop!

3115
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:37,010
Alright.

3116
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,610
Thank you for the super chat.

3117
01:59:38,710 --> 01:59:38,990
Thank you.

3118
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:39,510
Thank you.

3119
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:41,470
I'm an actor.

3120
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:43,010
I pretend to get beaten.

3121
01:59:43,130 --> 01:59:44,050
Really interesting idea.

3122
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:45,450
Coffee shop.

3123
01:59:46,030 --> 01:59:47,070
Minnie express.

3124
01:59:47,290 --> 01:59:48,330
So that was one, right?

3125
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:48,970
That's one.

3126
01:59:49,130 --> 01:59:49,390
Okay.

3127
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:50,190
Alright.

3128
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:51,230
Uh...

3129
01:59:51,230 --> 01:59:52,430
Here we go.

3130
01:59:53,670 --> 01:59:54,190
Pure.

3131
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:55,470
And then...

3132
01:59:55,470 --> 01:59:56,910
Pour this in.

3133
01:59:57,370 --> 02:00:01,670
Uh... This coffee shop was good before it became popular.

3134
02:00:02,690 --> 02:00:04,890
Thank you for the super chat, Minnie.

3135
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:05,610
Thank you.

3136
02:00:05,650 --> 02:00:06,330
Thank you.

3137
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:09,210
Your caff... Oh, I don't have...

3138
02:00:09,210 --> 02:00:10,370
I don't have a shot glass in here.

3139
02:00:12,350 --> 02:00:12,950
Okay.

3140
02:00:12,990 --> 02:00:15,010
Guys, when do I get to unlock other...

3141
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:15,410
Please.

3142
02:00:15,570 --> 02:00:15,990
Please.

3143
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:16,590
I...

3144
02:00:16,590 --> 02:00:18,750
I just wanna... I wanna unlock the...

3145
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:19,130
Please.

3146
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:20,990
Please calm down, everybody.

3147
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:23,230
Please calm down.

3148
02:00:25,890 --> 02:00:27,490
I'm not even...

3149
02:00:27,490 --> 02:00:28,590
No, Liam!

3150
02:00:28,690 --> 02:00:29,790
Where did Liam go?

3151
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,370
Liam!

3152
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:32,990
Why aren't you working faster, Liam?

3153
02:00:33,970 --> 02:00:34,570
Oh.

3154
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:35,470
Um...

3155
02:00:35,470 --> 02:00:36,750
We're doing too well.

3156
02:00:37,910 --> 02:00:40,410
Please leave more negative reviews, guys.

3157
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:44,410
Please leave more negative reviews.

3158
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:46,590
We have too many people in the shop!

3159
02:00:46,870 --> 02:00:48,250
Leave negative reviews!

3160
02:00:48,450 --> 02:00:49,570
Don't come back!

3161
02:00:49,970 --> 02:00:50,430
Please!

3162
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:52,030
Oh, thank God.

3163
02:00:52,130 --> 02:00:53,270
Thank God they heard me.

3164
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,790
Oh, thank God.

3165
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:00,290
Leave...

3166
02:01:01,110 --> 02:01:01,690
Okay.

3167
02:01:02,630 --> 02:01:04,070
Oh, thank God.

3168
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,350
Thank God they're actually leaving.

3169
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:06,330
Oh my God.

3170
02:01:08,910 --> 02:01:09,490
Okay.

3171
02:01:09,790 --> 02:01:10,370
Alright.

3172
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:12,110
Okay.

3173
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:13,850
Last customer of the day.

3174
02:01:14,210 --> 02:01:14,590
Okay.

3175
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:15,150
Last customer of the day.

3176
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:15,150
Yay!

3177
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:20,390
I missed when they gave me $90 per coffee.

3178
02:01:20,790 --> 02:01:23,190
Oh, they're ordering the cheapest coffee!

3179
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:24,030
That's why!

3180
02:01:25,010 --> 02:01:26,210
What the fuck?

3181
02:01:27,410 --> 02:01:28,550
They're so cheap!

3182
02:01:28,750 --> 02:01:30,350
Oh, I need a... I need clean.

3183
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:32,050
Clean, clean, clean.

3184
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:34,210
Clean, clean, clean.

3185
02:01:35,530 --> 02:01:36,750
Clean, clean, clean.

3186
02:01:38,110 --> 02:01:39,310
Clean, clean, clean.

3187
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:40,330
Sweep, sweep, sweep.

3188
02:01:41,290 --> 02:01:42,310
Okay, um...

3189
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:46,270
Okay, and then we gotta pick up the cigarette boxes and the cigarettes.

3190
02:01:46,590 --> 02:01:48,910
Who keeps smoking in my coffee shop?

3191
02:01:48,990 --> 02:01:50,550
It literally says no smoking!

3192
02:01:51,010 --> 02:01:52,570
Who's smuggling smokes?

3193
02:01:53,310 --> 02:01:54,850
In my coffee shop!

3194
02:01:57,330 --> 02:02:02,550
I know the trash can's over here, but I've been trying to see if I can collect trash bags up back here.

3195
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:04,030
Nobody can tell anyway!

3196
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:06,070
Nobody can tell!

3197
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:10,110
Liam, Liam, are you smoking in my coffee shop?

3198
02:02:10,450 --> 02:02:12,410
What are you stressed out about?

3199
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:15,430
I'm the one... Oh my god, he has to do two orders.

3200
02:02:15,770 --> 02:02:15,990
Okay.

3201
02:02:16,410 --> 02:02:17,510
Let's see...

3202
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:20,570
What are you stressed out about, Liam?

3203
02:02:22,950 --> 02:02:25,450
You had less customers to deal with than me!

3204
02:02:28,370 --> 02:02:30,290
Do I have anything coffee in here?

3205
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:34,610
Wait, what?

3206
02:02:35,710 --> 02:02:38,190
Did it not throw away the coffee?

3207
02:02:38,590 --> 02:02:40,070
Oh, it's the containers!

3208
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:41,310
Oh, okay.

3209
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:43,510
Alright, the trash bags.

3210
02:02:43,770 --> 02:02:44,470
And then...

3211
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:46,590
And then we put that in.

3212
02:02:47,150 --> 02:02:48,750
And then we fill it up.

3213
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:53,860
Give Liam a...

3214
02:02:53,860 --> 02:02:54,060
No!

3215
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,640
Nobody deserves break in this coffee shop!

3216
02:02:59,980 --> 02:03:01,380
None of us deserves it!

3217
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:05,400
If I'm gonna be unhappy, my workers...

3218
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:07,240
Okay.

3219
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:08,300
Okay.

3220
02:03:08,420 --> 02:03:08,600
Okay.

3221
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:15,540
Everybody has to be unhappy.

3222
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:20,000
Nobody can feel joy in this coffee shop.

3223
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:26,000
That's just the way it is.

3224
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:35,380
Why are you still working, Liam?

3225
02:03:35,980 --> 02:03:37,300
Where's the coffee?

3226
02:03:40,220 --> 02:03:42,400
The priest is really busy.

3227
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:43,880
Please leave her alone.

3228
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:46,020
I can't...

3229
02:03:46,020 --> 02:03:47,660
Thank you for this super chat.

3230
02:03:47,820 --> 02:03:49,120
Thank you, thank you.

3231
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:52,420
Liam!

3232
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:56,760
Where the fuck is this guy's coffee?

3233
02:03:56,760 --> 02:03:57,420
Liam!

3234
02:03:57,560 --> 02:04:00,260
Where is this guy's coffee?

3235
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:01,720
Liam.

3236
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:09,160
Liam, where is the coffee?

3237
02:04:09,160 --> 02:04:09,500
Happy Leo!

3238
02:04:14,280 --> 02:04:20,440
Leo gets $100 a day and he has 3 kids with 3 different ladies.

3239
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,180
Leo smokes.

3240
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:24,980
Thank you for the super chat, Ted.

3241
02:04:25,060 --> 02:04:25,760
Thank you.

3242
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:27,040
Leo!

3243
02:04:28,260 --> 02:04:30,300
Morgan is crying!

3244
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:35,700
How hard is it to get a fucking Americano?

3245
02:04:39,340 --> 02:04:44,160
I'm starting to think that Doki is cut out to be a barista.

3246
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,900
Alright, thank you for the super chat.

3247
02:04:47,100 --> 02:04:48,600
What are you talking about?

3248
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:50,460
I'm a great barista owner!

3249
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:52,860
We're gonna get toilets soon!

3250
02:04:59,000 --> 02:04:59,820
Liam, please!

3251
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:02,740
It's almost midnight, Liam!

3252
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,440
We closed 3 hours ago!

3253
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,940
How are you... I'm fucking leaving.

3254
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:09,140
Fuck this shit.

3255
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:10,680
I'm gonna fucking go to bed.

3256
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:13,060
I gotta go to bed.

3257
02:05:15,260 --> 02:05:17,480
Liam, thank you for the super chat.

3258
02:05:17,600 --> 02:05:18,760
Thank you, thank you.

3259
02:05:18,940 --> 02:05:21,180
I'm only on day 4.

3260
02:05:22,880 --> 02:05:26,380
How have I played this game for 2 hours already?

3261
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:29,120
There's no fucking way!

3262
02:05:29,700 --> 02:05:33,260
I played this game for 2 hours?

3263
02:05:33,880 --> 02:05:35,460
Holy shit!

3264
02:05:35,860 --> 02:05:37,300
I feel like I've...

3265
02:05:37,300 --> 02:05:38,600
Oh my god!

3266
02:05:38,680 --> 02:05:41,500
It did not feel like 2 hours!

3267
02:05:42,040 --> 02:05:43,600
Oh my god!

3268
02:05:44,840 --> 02:05:45,480
Okay...

3269
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:47,320
Alright...

3270
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:48,160
Um...

3271
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,520
What do we need?

3272
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:50,120
I already...

3273
02:05:50,120 --> 02:05:52,480
Okay, I put coffee grounds already over here.

3274
02:05:53,200 --> 02:05:54,480
And then...

3275
02:05:54,480 --> 02:05:55,240
Alright...

3276
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,520
We have 2 more hours.

3277
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:57,420
Um...

3278
02:05:57,420 --> 02:05:59,520
We're gonna order more coffee just in case.

3279
02:05:59,740 --> 02:06:01,620
Just in case, I feel like.

3280
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:03,120
Order.

3281
02:06:03,420 --> 02:06:05,020
I feel like we definitely need more.

3282
02:06:05,700 --> 02:06:06,340
Um...

3283
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:08,580
Let's see...

3284
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:09,900
We don't need milk yet.

3285
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:11,780
So, we're gonna need...

3286
02:06:12,300 --> 02:06:13,900
We're gonna need...

3287
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:16,440
Oh, I can sell supplies or food?

3288
02:06:17,020 --> 02:06:17,500
Wait...

3289
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:18,820
I could've done that?

3290
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,720
Okay, we need toilets first though.

3291
02:06:21,020 --> 02:06:23,240
We definitely need toilets first.

3292
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:24,460
We're so close to toilets.

3293
02:06:24,540 --> 02:06:25,380
We need $200.

3294
02:06:26,660 --> 02:06:27,140
Um...

3295
02:06:27,820 --> 02:06:30,560
I wanna sleep for 2 more hours so we can open up.

3296
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:32,000
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

3297
02:06:32,100 --> 02:06:32,820
Thank you, thank you.

3298
02:06:32,940 --> 02:06:36,100
Doki doing overtime on gaming like she doesn't game.

3299
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:39,440
Alright, we just need like...

3300
02:06:40,340 --> 02:06:42,840
2 more hours and then that should be good.

3301
02:06:43,040 --> 02:06:45,220
Alright, Liam, you live here.

3302
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,660
You don't even get to sleep.

3303
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:48,440
You don't get to go home and see your family.

3304
02:06:48,620 --> 02:06:51,940
You live here until you pay off my debt.

3305
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:58,640
You need this job more than you need anything else and you know that.

3306
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:00,040
You're here forever fucking ever.

3307
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:05,660
Um...

3308
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:06,080
So, all of those things are here.

3309
02:07:06,080 --> 02:07:07,260
Let's see, okay.

3310
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:08,340
We should be able to open.

3311
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:13,520
You're never gonna see your family again until I pay off all my... all the debt I have.

3312
02:07:15,440 --> 02:07:16,960
Alright, what does he want?

3313
02:07:18,940 --> 02:07:22,660
We want filtered coffee and big americano.

3314
02:07:22,660 --> 02:07:24,300
How much is the filtered again?

3315
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:25,940
Filtered coffee.

3316
02:07:26,900 --> 02:07:27,900
Medium, right?

3317
02:07:28,860 --> 02:07:29,420
437.

3318
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:32,220
Filtered... wait, is it medium?

3319
02:07:32,820 --> 02:07:34,840
Okay, big americano.

3320
02:07:35,580 --> 02:07:38,020
Alright, 28 degrees of coffee.

3321
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,380
That is fine by me.

3322
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:40,680
Wait, how many was it, guys?

3323
02:07:40,900 --> 02:07:41,860
Guys, I already forgot.

3324
02:07:41,960 --> 02:07:42,900
How many was it?

3325
02:07:44,060 --> 02:07:45,260
Guys, how many was it?

3326
02:07:46,080 --> 02:07:47,540
Guys, how many was it again?

3327
02:07:47,600 --> 02:07:49,480
I read it but now I forgot.

3328
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:51,880
Guys...

3329
02:07:55,540 --> 02:07:56,580
Was it 420?

3330
02:07:56,980 --> 02:07:58,660
Okay, I'm fucking reading this.

3331
02:07:59,460 --> 02:08:00,800
Uh, filtered medium.

3332
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:01,900
400...

3333
02:08:01,900 --> 02:08:02,200
Oh, it's a filter.

3334
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:02,340
It's full.

3335
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:04,000
Okay, it's full.

3336
02:08:05,700 --> 02:08:06,500
Alright, 473.

3337
02:08:06,540 --> 02:08:06,820
Okay.

3338
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:09,560
Alright, here we go.

3339
02:08:10,500 --> 02:08:10,900
470.

3340
02:08:11,620 --> 02:08:13,260
We just have to fill it all the way up.

3341
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:14,220
So we should be good.

3342
02:08:18,180 --> 02:08:18,980
Alright, 473.

3343
02:08:19,820 --> 02:08:20,800
That's the medium, right?

3344
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:21,140
Yeah.

3345
02:08:21,720 --> 02:08:22,460
That's the medium.

3346
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:23,740
Guys, don't worry.

3347
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:25,700
We're gonna heat this up, guys.

3348
02:08:26,060 --> 02:08:27,020
I have a plan.

3349
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:29,200
I have a huge plan.

3350
02:08:29,500 --> 02:08:30,920
Guys, I didn't even have to buy a kettle.

3351
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:33,740
I can't believe you guys told me to buy a kettle.

3352
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:37,100
I didn't even need the kettle!

3353
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:40,600
And the water originally already came!

3354
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:41,600
Oh my god.

3355
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:43,120
Okay, we're gonna put this away.

3356
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:44,660
So I can put...

3357
02:08:45,080 --> 02:08:45,920
Oh, I can't.

3358
02:08:45,940 --> 02:08:48,960
I can't put the... I can't fucking heat up my...

3359
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:49,520
Oh my gosh.

3360
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:49,780
Okay.

3361
02:08:50,100 --> 02:08:50,820
Calm down.

3362
02:08:59,920 --> 02:09:00,880
Calm down.

3363
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:01,700
Calm down.

3364
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:01,980
Calm down.

3365
02:09:02,120 --> 02:09:02,140
Calm down.

3366
02:09:02,140 --> 02:09:02,160
Calm down.

3367
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:02,960
Okay.

3368
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:04,300
Okay.

3369
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:07,020
Big Americano.

3370
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:07,520
Uh-huh.

3371
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:09,860
471 and one espresso.

3372
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:10,400
Okay.

3373
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:12,720
471 and one espresso.

3374
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:13,280
Okay.

3375
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:14,640
Um...

3376
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:17,420
Alright.

3377
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:19,300
And then I'll just put that back on.

3378
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:20,900
Um...

3379
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:22,580
Where's the big?

3380
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:23,780
Where's big?

3381
02:09:24,040 --> 02:09:24,260
Okay.

3382
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:24,700
Big.

3383
02:09:24,860 --> 02:09:25,200
Okay.

3384
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:26,380
Big.

3385
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:26,820
Okay.

3386
02:09:28,520 --> 02:09:29,160
Bitch.

3387
02:09:32,580 --> 02:09:33,060
Alright.

3388
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:34,260
Let's see.

3389
02:09:34,680 --> 02:09:36,200
And then we're gonna grab this.

3390
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,880
And we're gonna fill it up.

3391
02:09:38,260 --> 02:09:39,760
We're gonna fill it up!

3392
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:41,820
473!

3393
02:09:44,080 --> 02:09:44,840
Uh-huh.

3394
02:09:45,120 --> 02:09:45,660
It's okay.

3395
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:47,200
Wait, it was water.

3396
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:49,480
Oh my god.

3397
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:51,620
Oh my god, I'm so fucking...

3398
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:53,100
This is what I needed the kettle for.

3399
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:54,460
Oh my god.

3400
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:55,160
Okay.

3401
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:56,820
It's okay.

3402
02:09:56,920 --> 02:09:58,760
I figured it out.

3403
02:09:58,980 --> 02:10:00,880
Wait, how do I put water in here?

3404
02:10:02,980 --> 02:10:03,500
What?

3405
02:10:03,720 --> 02:10:03,980
What do I...

3406
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:06,920
What do I pour water?

3407
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:08,620
Wait.

3408
02:10:09,620 --> 02:10:10,860
Is it normal water?

3409
02:10:11,980 --> 02:10:13,160
Oh, normal water.

3410
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:13,880
Wait.

3411
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,780
Tap water?

3412
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:17,020
Okay, that does not sound right.

3413
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:18,420
Wait.

3414
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:19,160
Wait a minute.

3415
02:10:19,280 --> 02:10:19,480
What?

3416
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:21,340
Wait.

3417
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:22,240
Tap water?

3418
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:26,020
It's...

3419
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:31,860
Okay, we're gonna put it all the way here.

3420
02:10:31,880 --> 02:10:32,140
Okay.

3421
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:34,320
473.

3422
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:37,220
Wait, I should put the shot in first.

3423
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:38,500
Oh my god, you're right.

3424
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:39,560
Oh shit.

3425
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:40,120
It's okay.

3426
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:40,700
He's still here.

3427
02:10:42,580 --> 02:10:44,200
All right, we got that in.

3428
02:10:44,460 --> 02:10:45,180
And then...

3429
02:10:45,580 --> 02:10:46,980
And then we put water in.

3430
02:10:50,040 --> 02:10:50,960
All right, nice.

3431
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,300
And then that should be 473.

3432
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,840
I got plus 10 popularity.

3433
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:57,660
Please, why is my cafe still...

3434
02:10:57,660 --> 02:10:59,080
still is so popular?

3435
02:10:59,220 --> 02:10:59,580
I don't...

3436
02:10:59,580 --> 02:11:00,000
Please.

3437
02:11:05,200 --> 02:11:05,900
All right.

3438
02:11:06,280 --> 02:11:07,220
All right, guys.

3439
02:11:07,300 --> 02:11:09,940
You're gonna get some nice, juicy tap water coffee.

3440
02:11:10,900 --> 02:11:12,160
Oh no, man.

3441
02:11:12,260 --> 02:11:14,660
I don't feel good about using...

3442
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:15,360
Oh, whatever.

3443
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:17,060
Who cares what I feel?

3444
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,240
Like, cool.

3445
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:19,080
Wait.

3446
02:11:19,660 --> 02:11:20,380
I don't...

3447
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:22,400
I don't think this is correct.

3448
02:11:23,580 --> 02:11:24,440
I don't...

3449
02:11:25,440 --> 02:11:26,560
Oh, it's all right.

3450
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:27,300
He'll be fine.

3451
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:28,800
He's still happy.

3452
02:11:35,120 --> 02:11:37,740
It's a freezing place... who asked you?

3453
02:11:39,460 --> 02:11:40,920
Oh, I can buy a toilet!

3454
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:45,280
I just have a little extra water.

3455
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:46,920
It's just a little extra.

3456
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:48,580
Alright, nice.

3457
02:11:48,940 --> 02:11:49,740
Do I have...

3458
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,900
Do I have another barista now?

3459
02:11:52,120 --> 02:11:54,120
I have a bathroom, guys!

3460
02:11:54,680 --> 02:11:55,820
Oh, God.

3461
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:56,420
Okay.

3462
02:11:58,520 --> 02:11:59,400
Oh, the bills.

3463
02:11:59,580 --> 02:11:59,940
You're right.

3464
02:11:59,940 --> 02:12:00,960
There you go.

3465
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:02,500
What do you want?

3466
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:03,500
Americano?

3467
02:12:03,740 --> 02:12:04,620
Don't worry, man.

3468
02:12:07,540 --> 02:12:08,380
Okay, Americano.

3469
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:09,640
I need...

3470
02:12:10,080 --> 02:12:12,680
Okay, I don't want to do another coffee here.

3471
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,740
So I'm just going to do it here.

3472
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:15,020
Boom.

3473
02:12:16,600 --> 02:12:17,960
Okay, that's like...

3474
02:12:17,960 --> 02:12:19,520
What is the Americano again?

3475
02:12:19,580 --> 02:12:21,060
That was like...

3476
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,200
Uh...

3477
02:12:25,680 --> 02:12:27,620
Oh, 120 espresso.

3478
02:12:28,660 --> 02:12:29,080
Oh!

3479
02:12:30,280 --> 02:12:30,800
Oh!

3480
02:12:31,040 --> 02:12:34,880
Oh, I gave him less coffee!

3481
02:12:35,460 --> 02:12:37,340
But like, he was happy though.

3482
02:12:37,600 --> 02:12:38,220
You know what?

3483
02:12:38,260 --> 02:12:38,720
That's fine.

3484
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:42,100
I gave him less coffee, but he was still happy.

3485
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:43,120
You know?

3486
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:44,420
Like, they don't know.

3487
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:46,320
They're too stupid for that.

3488
02:12:46,400 --> 02:12:46,600
Yeah.

3489
02:12:46,800 --> 02:12:47,720
They're too...

3490
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:53,160
They don't know!

3491
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,360
It's just...

3492
02:12:55,360 --> 02:12:56,320
It was fun!

3493
02:12:56,580 --> 02:12:57,620
He didn't notice!

3494
02:12:57,760 --> 02:12:58,900
I told you guys!

3495
02:12:58,900 --> 02:13:03,680
Like, these people don't know anything about like regular coffee!

3496
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:05,140
They don't know anything!

3497
02:13:07,900 --> 02:13:09,240
They can't tell!

3498
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:11,880
They order the drink and they're just satisfied!

3499
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:13,460
They don't know!

3500
02:13:13,680 --> 02:13:14,780
They don't know jack shit!

3501
02:13:17,900 --> 02:13:20,000
Why are you here at the coffee shop?

3502
02:13:20,700 --> 02:13:22,660
Alright, let's put that at 400.

3503
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:24,960
Alright, and then...

3504
02:13:24,960 --> 02:13:27,280
Where's my other...

3505
02:13:27,280 --> 02:13:28,300
Um...

3506
02:13:28,300 --> 02:13:29,780
Oh, that's just water.

3507
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,240
Eh.

3508
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:37,580
Um...

3509
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:38,740
No!

3510
02:13:38,980 --> 02:13:40,120
She knew!

3511
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,720
This is not coffee!

3512
02:13:45,120 --> 02:13:46,920
I should have put espresso.

3513
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:48,440
God damn!

3514
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:49,600
I should have put espresso!

3515
02:13:50,640 --> 02:13:52,540
Oh, there's so many...

3516
02:13:52,540 --> 02:13:56,520
There's so many people that want so many...

3517
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:57,420
Coffee!

3518
02:13:58,160 --> 02:13:59,240
I'm done!

3519
02:14:02,720 --> 02:14:03,660
It's over.

3520
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:06,320
It's over.

3521
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:09,300
Get over here.

3522
02:14:13,120 --> 02:14:14,600
I don't have any...

3523
02:14:14,600 --> 02:14:15,620
It's over.

3524
02:14:16,580 --> 02:14:17,880
Get out.

3525
02:14:19,260 --> 02:14:20,020
Get out.

3526
02:14:21,280 --> 02:14:22,380
Get out.

3527
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:23,880
Get out!

3528
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:24,420
I'm done!

3529
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:25,840
I'm done!

3530
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:27,880
I'm done!

3531
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,040
I'm done!

3532
02:14:32,460 --> 02:14:34,100
Hey, my popularity increased.

3533
02:14:34,400 --> 02:14:34,720
Yeah.

3534
02:14:35,280 --> 02:14:35,960
Alright.

3535
02:14:40,850 --> 02:14:43,610
Guys, being a barista is really hard.

3536
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:45,050
Guys.

3537
02:14:49,530 --> 02:14:50,210
Guys.

3538
02:14:53,210 --> 02:14:54,290
I don't...

3539
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:57,370
I don't want to be a barista anymore.

3540
02:14:58,950 --> 02:14:59,430
Why not?

3541
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:06,750
I think...

3542
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:08,550
I think I'm...

3543
02:15:09,490 --> 02:15:12,550
I think I'm ready to close up my shop.

3544
02:15:12,710 --> 02:15:13,310
I think...

3545
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:14,450
Okay, I got...

3546
02:15:14,450 --> 02:15:15,110
Hey, guys.

3547
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:15,630
I got...

3548
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:17,070
I got more coffee, guys.

3549
02:15:17,190 --> 02:15:17,570
Hey.

3550
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:19,330
And your coffee arrived.

3551
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:20,070
Yay.

3552
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:22,530
Hey guys!

3553
02:15:22,610 --> 02:15:23,470
I restocked.

3554
02:15:26,890 --> 02:15:28,170
Oh my god!

3555
02:15:28,270 --> 02:15:29,390
Oh my god!

3556
02:15:29,690 --> 02:15:31,330
I restocked!

3557
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:33,170
Shady, thank you for the aqua soup!

3558
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:34,670
Thank you, thank you!

3559
02:15:35,180 --> 02:15:42,970
Thank you, moi moi coon, for my double espresso caro macchiato with whipped cream and chocolate sprinkles on top!

3560
02:15:43,170 --> 02:15:45,090
With a breakfast croissant!

3561
02:15:45,710 --> 02:15:47,490
I can give you this!

3562
02:15:53,830 --> 02:15:56,050
No, I can't hit Liam!

3563
02:15:56,210 --> 02:15:57,770
I can't hit Liam!

3564
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:04,070
Alright guys, it's...

3565
02:16:04,070 --> 02:16:06,090
announcement time.

3566
02:16:06,390 --> 02:16:07,590
Let me swap over.

3567
02:16:07,970 --> 02:16:08,370
Okay.

3568
02:16:10,090 --> 02:16:11,050
Okay.

3569
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:17,350
Oh my god.

3570
02:16:17,770 --> 02:16:19,470
Oh my god.

3571
02:16:19,970 --> 02:16:21,710
I can't...

3572
02:16:23,470 --> 02:16:25,530
I thought... you know...

3573
02:16:25,530 --> 02:16:27,470
I thought... you know...

3574
02:16:27,470 --> 02:16:28,890
I don't know... I thought...

3575
02:16:29,350 --> 02:16:31,070
Barista Simulator...

3576
02:16:31,070 --> 02:16:32,770
would be okay...

3577
02:16:33,330 --> 02:16:35,090
But I didn't realize...

3578
02:16:35,090 --> 02:16:39,370
I didn't realize...

3579
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:41,570
how not okay I was.

3580
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:48,810
I was... I was...

3581
02:16:49,370 --> 02:16:51,930
I was absolutely not okay.

3582
02:16:53,690 --> 02:16:55,510
I was absolutely not okay.

3583
02:16:57,930 --> 02:17:00,470
Shoutout to all the baristas out there.

3584
02:17:00,670 --> 02:17:02,010
Shoutout to you guys.

3585
02:17:02,350 --> 02:17:07,030
I can't last longer than five days being a barista.

3586
02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:08,230
I cannot.

3587
02:17:09,150 --> 02:17:09,510
I...

3588
02:17:11,310 --> 02:17:13,550
I thought... I was like...

3589
02:17:13,550 --> 02:17:14,370
It's just coffee!

3590
02:17:14,790 --> 02:17:17,070
How hard can making coffee be?

3591
02:17:17,250 --> 02:17:20,230
There's like hundreds of Tim Hortons out there.

3592
02:17:20,570 --> 02:17:22,190
How hard can it be?

3593
02:17:22,630 --> 02:17:23,450
There's so...

3594
02:17:23,470 --> 02:17:27,090
so many like indie coffee shops where all the hipsters go.

3595
02:17:27,490 --> 02:17:29,170
Like... Surely like...

3596
02:17:29,170 --> 02:17:30,530
It can't be that difficult.

3597
02:17:31,270 --> 02:17:32,290
Oh my god.

3598
02:17:32,330 --> 02:17:33,130
I was so wrong.

3599
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:34,710
I had like five orders.

3600
02:17:35,010 --> 02:17:37,350
I have five items on my menu.

3601
02:17:37,430 --> 02:17:39,970
I haven't even gotten to the lattes.

3602
02:17:40,070 --> 02:17:42,870
I haven't gotten to the milk yet.

3603
02:17:46,030 --> 02:17:47,390
I haven't...

3604
02:17:47,390 --> 02:17:48,470
I haven't...

3605
02:17:48,470 --> 02:17:49,330
I haven't...

3606
02:17:49,330 --> 02:17:52,310
I haven't even gotten to the milk portion of the recipe.

3607
02:17:53,470 --> 02:17:55,230
Why was this so difficult?

3608
02:17:58,770 --> 02:17:59,990
There was just...

3609
02:17:59,990 --> 02:18:02,130
There was just five recipes!

3610
02:18:03,310 --> 02:18:07,370
Darkblade do not call Tim Hortons coffee, please.

3611
02:18:07,770 --> 02:18:08,870
Thank you for the super chat.

3612
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:09,330
Thank you.

3613
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:09,810
Thank you.

3614
02:18:09,810 --> 02:18:12,790
People still buy Tim Hortons over making their own coffee.

3615
02:18:12,910 --> 02:18:13,770
That's all I'm saying.

3616
02:18:17,390 --> 02:18:18,530
Oh my god.

3617
02:18:18,730 --> 02:18:23,530
We were only at the beginning of the game, but it was so much.

3618
02:18:23,830 --> 02:18:25,250
It was so much.

3619
02:18:25,770 --> 02:18:26,990
Holy shit.

3620
02:18:28,070 --> 02:18:28,710
Anyway.

3621
02:18:29,190 --> 02:18:30,150
Anyway guys.

3622
02:18:30,450 --> 02:18:30,910
Alright.

3623
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:31,290
Whoa.

3624
02:18:31,490 --> 02:18:33,770
I'm really nervous about some of these announcements.

3625
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:35,910
But...

3626
02:18:35,910 --> 02:18:38,610
Let me stretch before I do it.

3627
02:18:38,710 --> 02:18:39,090
Wow!

3628
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:39,910
Alright.

3629
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:40,490
So.

3630
02:18:41,170 --> 02:18:43,870
This announcement sort of already got leaked out.

3631
02:18:44,610 --> 02:18:49,370
Because I saw people that were like, oh my god.

3632
02:18:49,450 --> 02:18:51,210
Is this the... Is this...

3633
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:52,390
actually Doki?

3634
02:18:52,650 --> 02:18:58,270
So like, some of you guys already know this announcement because it got leaked out.

3635
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:02,590
And then it got like posted somewhere.

3636
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:04,550
So then people were like, oh my god.

3637
02:19:08,930 --> 02:19:13,650
So I thought it was really... But I couldn't confirm or deny it until like today.

3638
02:19:13,970 --> 02:19:14,490
So.

3639
02:19:15,890 --> 02:19:16,430
Alright.

3640
02:19:16,670 --> 02:19:19,890
There's actually... There's also one of the things that...

3641
02:19:21,950 --> 02:19:22,790
Oh my gosh.

3642
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:26,410
It has been on my goals list for a very long time.

3643
02:19:27,550 --> 02:19:29,990
It's been on the goals list for a long time.

3644
02:19:30,430 --> 02:19:30,870
So...

3645
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:33,010
I said like...

3646
02:19:33,010 --> 02:19:33,970
out of...

3647
02:19:41,010 --> 02:19:42,770
I'm like super, super nervous.

3648
02:19:42,850 --> 02:19:43,350
But like...

3649
02:19:43,350 --> 02:19:47,450
I feel... You guys already know what the announcement... I like how I'm wearing my barista uniform.

3650
02:19:47,690 --> 02:19:48,030
Okay guys.

3651
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:49,370
Let me take off my barista uniform.

3652
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:50,470
And my brace.

3653
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:51,350
Let me...

3654
02:19:51,370 --> 02:19:52,450
Give me a sec.

3655
02:19:52,650 --> 02:19:55,410
I need to take off my uniform first.

3656
02:19:55,530 --> 02:19:57,050
If I'm gonna do this announcement.

3657
02:19:57,430 --> 02:19:58,410
Give me a sec.

3658
02:19:58,610 --> 02:19:58,850
Okay.

3659
02:19:59,010 --> 02:19:59,570
Let me...

3660
02:19:59,570 --> 02:20:00,110
Alright.

3661
02:20:00,370 --> 02:20:01,950
My uniform is off now.

3662
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:02,330
Okay.

3663
02:20:06,710 --> 02:20:07,270
Alright.

3664
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:09,470
Oh my gosh.

3665
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:10,730
Oh!

3666
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:12,410
Oh my gosh.

3667
02:20:12,430 --> 02:20:12,710
Sorry.

3668
02:20:12,790 --> 02:20:15,870
I'm like super... I'm super duper nervous.

3669
02:20:17,850 --> 02:20:20,650
But... I will show the graphic first.

3670
02:20:20,730 --> 02:20:22,850
Why I'm like... I'm like...

3671
02:20:22,850 --> 02:20:23,210
Yay!

3672
02:20:25,670 --> 02:20:27,850
This is actually one of my dreams.

3673
02:20:29,350 --> 02:20:30,390
One of my dreams.

3674
02:20:30,510 --> 02:20:33,390
So I'm really, really, really, really excited.

3675
02:20:34,670 --> 02:20:35,710
Okay guys.

3676
02:20:35,810 --> 02:20:36,050
Sorry.

3677
02:20:36,350 --> 02:20:36,870
Sorry.

3678
02:20:36,930 --> 02:20:38,650
I realized I need to move away a little bit.

3679
02:20:38,690 --> 02:20:39,210
I'm gonna...

3680
02:20:39,210 --> 02:20:41,310
Let me like move first.

3681
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:49,430
Let me move a little bit first guys.

3682
02:20:49,630 --> 02:20:50,130
Okay.

3683
02:20:50,270 --> 02:20:51,310
For real now.

3684
02:20:51,350 --> 02:20:51,810
For real.

3685
02:20:51,930 --> 02:20:52,350
For...

3686
02:20:52,830 --> 02:20:53,690
For...

3687
02:20:54,630 --> 02:20:56,070
For real now.

3688
02:20:56,250 --> 02:20:59,150
But this this announcement has been leaked earlier.

3689
02:20:59,550 --> 02:21:05,370
Because some people saw a particular thing on a pamphlet.

3690
02:21:05,650 --> 02:21:08,030
And it is... Ta-da!

3691
02:21:09,430 --> 02:21:13,470
I'm going to be at ACG HK.

3692
02:21:14,470 --> 02:21:15,530
In Hong Kong.

3693
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:22,810
I've always thought this would never happen for me.

3694
02:21:26,330 --> 02:21:26,970
Because...

3695
02:21:26,970 --> 02:21:28,990
For those who don't know...

3696
02:21:30,210 --> 02:21:36,730
ACG HK is the biggest convention in Hong Kong.

3697
02:21:37,490 --> 02:21:38,130
And...

3698
02:21:38,130 --> 02:21:39,570
This has been...

3699
02:21:39,570 --> 02:21:42,830
This has been like my number one convention.

3700
02:21:43,970 --> 02:21:46,570
That I wanted to do in my career.

3701
02:21:46,850 --> 02:21:50,010
And I always thought that like...

3702
02:21:50,630 --> 02:21:51,570
It was never possible.

3703
02:21:51,830 --> 02:21:52,810
That I didn't have a lot of fans.

3704
02:21:52,830 --> 02:21:54,370
Um...

3705
02:21:54,370 --> 02:21:55,710
To make it possible.

3706
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:57,330
Um...

3707
02:21:57,330 --> 02:22:01,710
And I thought I wasn't like popular enough in Hong Kong to do this.

3708
02:22:01,830 --> 02:22:02,610
Because...

3709
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:09,110
ACG HK is like... basically like the Comic Con for NA.

3710
02:22:09,490 --> 02:22:10,270
And...

3711
02:22:10,270 --> 02:22:13,370
ACG HK is like the Comic Con of Hong Kong.

3712
02:22:13,630 --> 02:22:14,090
So...

3713
02:22:15,950 --> 02:22:16,730
So...

3714
02:22:17,710 --> 02:22:18,490
So...

3715
02:22:18,490 --> 02:22:22,370
It is a huge honor to be invited.

3716
02:22:23,270 --> 02:22:23,830
Um...

3717
02:22:23,830 --> 02:22:27,510
And... This is like one of my dream conventions.

3718
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:31,050
Uh... To be invited to this convention.

3719
02:22:31,870 --> 02:22:32,430
Because...

3720
02:22:32,430 --> 02:22:36,470
Uh... ACG HK was like my very first convention.

3721
02:22:36,630 --> 02:22:37,610
As a child.

3722
02:22:37,750 --> 02:22:40,270
Like... It was the very first convention I ever went to.

3723
02:22:41,250 --> 02:22:42,370
Um... And...

3724
02:22:42,370 --> 02:22:45,970
You know... I had like a lot of very happy memories going there.

3725
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:46,430
Like...

3726
02:22:46,430 --> 02:22:47,610
For like a couple of years.

3727
02:22:48,550 --> 02:22:51,130
Um... And... I spent a lot of money.

3728
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:54,290
At ACG HK.

3729
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:56,610
And... It's like...

3730
02:22:56,610 --> 02:22:58,550
Um... Honestly like...

3731
02:22:58,550 --> 02:23:02,350
Uh... The big... One of the biggest honors to have and to be invited.

3732
02:23:03,010 --> 02:23:04,950
Um... To be invited for this year.

3733
02:23:05,110 --> 02:23:05,590
For it.

3734
02:23:06,030 --> 02:23:06,550
Um...

3735
02:23:06,550 --> 02:23:07,090
And yeah.

3736
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:08,810
This is like literally my dream convention.

3737
02:23:08,910 --> 02:23:11,490
So I'm really thankful for them to invite me.

3738
02:23:11,630 --> 02:23:14,090
I'll be at the main stage!

3739
02:23:14,990 --> 02:23:15,510
Yes!

3740
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:17,790
I will be at the main stage.

3741
02:23:18,070 --> 02:23:18,590
So...

3742
02:23:18,590 --> 02:23:19,470
The main stage panel.

3743
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:20,630
It's already...

3744
02:23:20,630 --> 02:23:22,810
The leak was that they released a pamphlet.

3745
02:23:22,830 --> 02:23:23,610
Of the schedule.

3746
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:28,270
And people saw like... Uh... Doki's Hong Kong Adventures on there.

3747
02:23:28,390 --> 02:23:29,010
And they were like...

3748
02:23:29,010 --> 02:23:30,630
Is that the real Doki?

3749
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,610
In the pamphlet?

3750
02:23:31,890 --> 02:23:32,350
Yes!

3751
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:33,070
That is me!

3752
02:23:33,250 --> 02:23:33,610
I...

3753
02:23:33,610 --> 02:23:36,430
That was me on the...

3754
02:23:36,430 --> 02:23:37,390
That is me!

3755
02:23:38,590 --> 02:23:39,910
So people couldn't tell.

3756
02:23:40,090 --> 02:23:42,810
Couldn't tell if it was like... Uh...

3757
02:23:42,810 --> 02:23:46,310
If it was like me or like some other Doki.

3758
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:47,230
Uh...

3759
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:51,750
Anyway.

3760
02:23:52,150 --> 02:23:52,590
Anyway.

3761
02:23:52,830 --> 02:23:54,510
So I will be at the main stage.

3762
02:23:55,790 --> 02:23:56,750
And... Um...

3763
02:23:56,750 --> 02:24:00,230
There's gonna be games, a Q&A, and some... Yeah.

3764
02:24:00,250 --> 02:24:01,630
Some like mini games and a panel.

3765
02:24:02,350 --> 02:24:02,830
Um...

3766
02:24:02,830 --> 02:24:04,470
And it's free to watch.

3767
02:24:04,570 --> 02:24:05,050
Basically.

3768
02:24:05,110 --> 02:24:07,390
So for like those in Hong Kong.

3769
02:24:07,750 --> 02:24:09,110
Um... It is free to watch.

3770
02:24:09,210 --> 02:24:10,310
You don't have to pay any tickets.

3771
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:13,850
But they are releasing five types of merch.

3772
02:24:14,570 --> 02:24:15,050
Uh...

3773
02:24:15,050 --> 02:24:18,270
Including a new Hong Kong style key visual.

3774
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:21,430
And details of that will be announced soon.

3775
02:24:21,570 --> 02:24:22,810
So there's gonna be like five months.

3776
02:24:22,830 --> 02:24:26,370
So I'm gonna be able to get some merch created just for regarding uh... Regarding this convention.

3777
02:24:27,250 --> 02:24:31,310
And I'll also be hosting a uh... Meet and Greet for this session.

3778
02:24:31,590 --> 02:24:36,930
Um... And basically if you buy the bundle set of my merch, you can join the Meet and Greet.

3779
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:39,230
Uh... Before my main stage panel.

3780
02:24:39,430 --> 02:24:39,910
So...

3781
02:24:39,910 --> 02:24:42,190
Uh... Or like panel, mini games, and everything.

3782
02:24:42,430 --> 02:24:44,290
So that is... Uh...

3783
02:24:44,290 --> 02:24:48,150
So you buy the bundle merch, you basically will be able to do a Meet and Greet.

3784
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:49,510
But there is a max number.

3785
02:24:49,510 --> 02:24:54,410
So it is like first come first serve when it comes to um...

3786
02:24:55,190 --> 02:24:58,870
When it comes to uh... this uh... Meet and Greet in Hong Kong.

3787
02:24:59,150 --> 02:25:01,270
And uh... Oh my gosh.

3788
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:08,630
I'm just so... I'm just really, really happy because this is like I said, this is like one of my dream goals to accomplish.

3789
02:25:08,970 --> 02:25:15,350
Like I remember in the past when I was like... The one convention that I really, really, really wanna go was ACTHK.

3790
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:19,490
And I honestly... I always thought that like I was just not popular than I was.

3791
02:25:19,510 --> 02:25:20,270
I was not popular enough in Hong Kong.

3792
02:25:20,850 --> 02:25:22,870
Um... To be it, but it was just...

3793
02:25:23,430 --> 02:25:24,610
I was proven wrong!

3794
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:25,630
I was...

3795
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:26,010
I...

3796
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:28,970
I was... I was proven wrong!

3797
02:25:30,530 --> 02:25:33,370
All my fans were like, that's not true Doki!

3798
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:34,750
We want you there!

3799
02:25:34,970 --> 02:25:35,570
We want you...

3800
02:25:35,570 --> 02:25:36,410
We wanna meet you!

3801
02:25:37,170 --> 02:25:37,650
Um...

3802
02:25:37,650 --> 02:25:38,510
So I'm really happy.

3803
02:25:38,630 --> 02:25:39,630
I'll be speaking Cantonese.

3804
02:25:40,010 --> 02:25:42,050
I'll try to be speaking Cantonese.

3805
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:43,530
So I'll try my best.

3806
02:25:44,390 --> 02:25:45,210
I'm like...

3807
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:48,010
I'm gonna...

3808
02:25:48,010 --> 02:25:50,470
I'm gonna try my best to speak Cantonese.

3809
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:51,430
And...

3810
02:25:51,430 --> 02:25:52,150
Oh my gosh.

3811
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:52,830
Funny story.

3812
02:25:53,130 --> 02:25:54,770
But like... They were like...

3813
02:25:54,770 --> 02:25:57,150
Please don't swear because there's children.

3814
02:25:57,290 --> 02:25:58,830
So I will try not to swear!

3815
02:26:01,810 --> 02:26:05,910
I'm gonna try very hard to be PG!

3816
02:26:06,370 --> 02:26:09,890
I'm gonna try so hard to be PG!

3817
02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:14,910
I mean...

3818
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:17,330
This will be the hardest mission ever.

3819
02:26:17,330 --> 02:26:19,210
Gotta stay PG!

3820
02:26:19,610 --> 02:26:20,670
For the children!

3821
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:22,630
For the children Doki!

3822
02:26:23,450 --> 02:26:24,010
Um...

3823
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:27,390
Another thing is that I will be at...

3824
02:26:27,390 --> 02:26:31,590
Um... This isn't like the only appearance that I'll be making in Hong Kong.

3825
02:26:31,870 --> 02:26:34,550
Um... I will be at Yu-san's concert.

3826
02:26:34,990 --> 02:26:37,030

So that will be a week after ACGHK.

3828

And... Basically it is an independent event in Hong Kong.

3829
02:26:45,610 --> 02:26:47,270
Sorry I have like... I need to remember... Like...

3830
02:26:47,330 --> 02:26:49,450
Stuff I have to remember to say about it because there's a lot of details.

3831
02:26:53,100 --> 02:26:59,180
And there will be a fan support zone where like fans can start basically a fan campaign for me and Yu-san.

3832
02:26:59,940 --> 02:27:00,420
And...

3833
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:04,440
I will be performing um... with Yu-san.

3834
02:27:04,980 --> 02:27:06,280
Uh... For this concert.

3835
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:09,340
It's like basically a week after ACGHK.

3836
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:12,620
And... We did prepare some secret content there too.

3837
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:13,480
Not just the song.

3838
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:14,700
And...

3839
02:27:14,700 --> 02:27:15,400

I'm just so excited.

3842
02:27:20,400 --> 02:27:20,900
I...

3843
02:27:20,900 --> 02:27:21,660
I really am.

3844
02:27:21,740 --> 02:27:22,780
This is actually...

3845
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:25,700
Uh... Like I said, it's a world tour!

3846
02:27:26,020 --> 02:27:26,940
It's a world tour.

3847
02:27:27,260 --> 02:27:31,740
And we added so many destinations on this world tour.

3848
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:32,720
Uh...

3849
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:34,360
To be able to meet you guys.

3850
02:27:34,420 --> 02:27:36,260
Meet all the dragoons and everything.

3851
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:38,660
And I'm honestly... I'm just...

3852
02:27:39,080 --> 02:27:43,540
I... I'm just so excited to uh... Meet dragoons around the world!

3853
02:27:43,700 --> 02:27:47,260
And to be able to announce the Hong Kong edition as well.

3854
02:27:48,040 --> 02:27:49,160
Um... And...

3855
02:27:49,180 --> 02:27:55,120
Like... You know, being able to do a convention that was basically like my...

3856
02:27:55,120 --> 02:28:01,340
My very first ever convention that I've ever went to as a child.

3857
02:28:01,540 --> 02:28:02,480
And just...

3858
02:28:02,480 --> 02:28:04,640
And then being on the main stage now.

3859
02:28:04,800 --> 02:28:05,440
That's...

3860
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:08,280
That's... That's a lot.

3861
02:28:11,300 --> 02:28:12,780
It's something that...

3862
02:28:12,780 --> 02:28:17,880
You know... I never expected at all to happen in my life.

3863
02:28:18,020 --> 02:28:19,440
So I'm super thankful.

3864
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:20,640
And...

3865
02:28:20,920 --> 02:28:22,400
I'm just... I'm just really happy.

3866
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:26,960
And... To be able to have this opportunity with all of you guys.

3867
02:28:27,460 --> 02:28:28,500
Um... Okay!

3868
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:31,040
This is not the last... We have an announcement for...

3869
02:28:31,040 --> 02:28:34,340
So now some of you guys are like, so what is tomorrow's secret stream?

3870
02:28:34,820 --> 02:28:35,380
Um...

3871
02:28:36,340 --> 02:28:36,900
Okay!

3872
02:28:37,080 --> 02:28:38,720
This is also another dream!

3873
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:42,480
That I never thought would be a reality!

3874
02:28:43,140 --> 02:28:43,700
So...

3875
02:28:44,600 --> 02:28:48,660
We literally like finalized the details for this.

3876
02:28:49,180 --> 02:28:50,440
Like... This morning.

3877
02:28:51,080 --> 02:28:52,780
So... Um... I was like...

3878
02:28:52,780 --> 02:28:55,040
That's why I was like, oh I don't know if like...

3879
02:28:55,040 --> 02:29:03,500
Tomorrow I can even do this secret stream because like we're still negotiating details about what I'm supposed to be doing and everything.

3880
02:29:04,400 --> 02:29:04,920

It's called The Void Within.

3914
02:30:27,810 --> 02:30:29,130
And... Oh my gosh!

3915
02:30:29,170 --> 02:30:30,830
I remember looking through like...

3916
02:30:30,830 --> 02:30:31,670
The plot.

3917
02:30:31,790 --> 02:30:33,050
Like the plots they would have.

3918
02:30:33,530 --> 02:30:36,870
And like the guy... Like the little storylines they would have and everything.

3919
02:30:36,990 --> 02:30:37,430
The lore.

3920
02:30:38,190 --> 02:30:38,670
Um...

3921
02:30:39,190 --> 02:30:39,670
Neopets.

3922
02:30:39,930 --> 02:30:43,710
Um... The one with like the... The Neopets Atlantis.

3923
02:30:43,830 --> 02:30:47,350
Was it Mar... Mar... I don't know how to pronounce it cause I would always read the names.

3924
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:48,550
But the... The...

3925
02:30:49,070 --> 02:30:50,890
Mar... Marroquan or what?

3926
02:30:51,130 --> 02:30:51,470
Haha!

3927
02:30:51,490 --> 02:30:56,530
The Marro... The Marroquan I could never pronounce the name of the lands.

3928
02:30:56,810 --> 02:30:57,830
But there was that one.

3929
02:30:57,970 --> 02:31:00,350
And there was the one with the Altador.

3930
02:31:00,670 --> 02:31:01,530
The Altator.

3931
02:31:01,670 --> 02:31:02,470
Secret Altadors.

3932
02:31:02,890 --> 02:31:06,990
And then that led to like the Olympics of Neopets.

3933
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:10,690
And then there was one with the Daragon Kingdom.

3934
02:31:11,150 --> 02:31:12,910
And then there's the other... Oh my god.

3935
02:31:12,930 --> 02:31:13,390
There were so many.

3936
02:31:13,470 --> 02:31:14,470
The one with Dr. Sloth.

3937
02:31:14,790 --> 02:31:15,770
Oh my gosh.

3938
02:31:15,850 --> 02:31:17,610
But they have a new plotline!

3939
02:31:17,830 --> 02:31:19,310
They have a new plotline!

3940
02:31:19,370 --> 02:31:20,590
Called The Void Within!

3941
02:31:20,590 --> 02:31:27,430
And it is gonna be sponsored by Neopets to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

3942
02:31:29,350 --> 02:31:33,950
Um... I'm super duper duper duper duper duper excited uh... to...

3943
02:31:34,490 --> 02:31:37,510
uh... to be able to do this with Neopets as a collaboration.

3944
02:31:37,850 --> 02:31:39,910
And I hope to have more future collabs with them.

3945
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:40,610
Yeah!

3946
02:31:41,370 --> 02:31:43,450
It was great working with them on this.

3947
02:31:43,730 --> 02:31:45,570
Um... They were like what's your favorite Neopets?

3948
02:31:45,590 --> 02:31:47,190
And I like gave them a huge giant list.

3949
02:31:47,290 --> 02:31:49,710
And then we're like okay we'll see what we can do here.

3950
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:50,950
We got it!

3951
02:31:51,470 --> 02:31:52,290
Um... But yes!

3952
02:31:52,290 --> 02:31:54,510
That is what tomorrow's stream gonna be about!

3953
02:31:54,850 --> 02:31:56,950
Um... It is a Neopets centric stream.

3954
02:31:57,310 --> 02:31:58,650
And uh...

3955
02:31:58,650 --> 02:32:00,730
Like I said it's just... It's to look... uh...

3956
02:32:00,730 --> 02:32:03,410
They... They asked me to look at The Void Within.

3957
02:32:03,670 --> 02:32:06,170
But most likely I'll also be looking at other stuff too.

3958
02:32:06,330 --> 02:32:08,330
I might even go over time than what they paid me.

3959
02:32:08,410 --> 02:32:09,530
Because like I love Neopets.

3960
02:32:09,670 --> 02:32:18,910
And I can't believe I'm being paid for... I'm being paid for to play a... a childhood game that I invested like a lot lot of hours as a kid.

3961
02:32:20,590 --> 02:32:22,750
So that's so crazy to think about!

3962
02:32:22,930 --> 02:32:28,590
And like they're paying me to play their... to play their website!

3963
02:32:28,910 --> 02:32:31,750
And it's just... It's just insane to think about!

3964
02:32:32,130 --> 02:32:33,530
It's insane to think about!

3965
02:32:33,730 --> 02:32:35,530
And I'm really thankful too.

3966
02:32:35,710 --> 02:32:37,510
And they sent me like care packages and everything.

3967
02:32:37,770 --> 02:32:41,730
And it's just a really huge shout out to uh... to Neopets team.

3968
02:32:41,950 --> 02:32:44,110

02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:48,550
And that's what basically...

3971
02:32:48,550 --> 02:32:50,450

02:32:50,590 --> 02:32:52,670

I'm so excited for you guys to see uh... the merch that will be sold there as well.

3987
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:35,820
Um... Regarding if there's gonna be online sales for the merch, I'll ask my... I'll ask my management team.

3988
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:38,380
Um... Because I actually don't know the answer to that.

3989
02:33:38,580 --> 02:33:44,420
But if there's... I think like I'll see... I'll ask if there's like uh... if there's like remaining stock.

3990
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:46,500
If they can sell it online as well.

For...

4027
02:35:03,870 --> 02:35:04,670
my journey.

4028
02:35:04,930 --> 02:35:06,330
To be able to have...

4029
02:35:06,330 --> 02:35:08,510
Like just to be able to experience all of that.

4030
02:35:08,630 --> 02:35:12,350
I never expected to you know be able to get to experience these things.

4031
02:35:12,490 --> 02:35:12,730
Anyway!

4032
02:35:13,190 --> 02:35:14,730
It's a long time coming.

4033
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:17,990
But we're finally gonna have donation reading time.

4034
02:35:18,170 --> 02:35:18,490
Yay!

4035

Let's see.

4045
02:35:37,710 --> 02:35:37,930
Okay.

4046
02:35:37,970 --> 02:35:40,870
I need to do like... Let me make sure there's an outline though.

4047
02:35:40,970 --> 02:35:42,970
So there's an outline for us.

4048
02:35:43,190 --> 02:35:43,570
Wait.

4049
02:35:43,650 --> 02:35:45,830
What color can I... Can I not change the outline color?

4050
02:35:45,910 --> 02:35:46,270
Oh there I can.

4051
02:35:46,590 --> 02:35:47,190
Let's see.

4052
02:35:47,250 --> 02:35:47,830
What the fuck?

4053
02:35:48,070 --> 02:35:49,590
Why can't I change the outline color?

4054
02:35:50,210 --> 02:35:51,110
Um... Guys sorry.

4055
02:35:51,150 --> 02:35:51,970
It's been like a while.

4056
02:35:52,130 --> 02:35:53,610
Since I've had like...

4062
02:35:59,870 --> 02:36:01,670

Oh my god!

4064
02:36:03,230 --> 02:36:06,630
We have 50k left till the special karaoke.

4065
02:36:07,190 --> 02:36:09,830
And I also have to finish the fucking climbing game too.

02:36:09,970 --> 02:36:11,790

4067

Uh... Weird!

4115
02:37:10,450 --> 02:37:13,970
I'm on work wifi so I'm experiencing the new intro at 240p.

4116
02:37:14,090 --> 02:37:15,290
Just as Toki intended.

Oh no.

4122
02:37:19,630 --> 02:37:21,370
Being dragged into retail hell again.

4123
02:37:21,470 --> 02:37:22,190
Here we go again.

4124
02:37:22,330 --> 02:37:22,890
Thank you for the super chat.

4125
02:37:22,990 --> 02:37:23,190
Thank you.

4126
02:37:23,230 --> 02:37:23,650
Thank you.

4127
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:24,370
Oh my god!

4128
02:37:25,950 --> 02:37:26,350
Um...

4129
02:37:26,810 --> 02:37:27,210
Uh...

4130
02:37:27,210 --> 02:37:29,330
Thank you for... uh...

4131
02:37:30,290 --> 02:37:31,250
Uh... Oh yeah.

4132
02:37:31,290 --> 02:37:32,970
I hope you guys like the new intro.

4133
02:37:33,070 --> 02:37:35,850
I'm thinking about like... for the... for future...

4134
02:37:35,850 --> 02:37:38,910
I would love to do like future intros with just different outfits.

4135
02:37:39,230 --> 02:37:40,590
I think that would be really fun.

4136
02:37:40,830 --> 02:37:43,850
Like every time we get a new outfit, we get a new intro.

4137
02:37:44,050 --> 02:37:44,350
We're...

4138
02:37:46,270 --> 02:37:52,310
I think that would be like... I feel like that would be like... uh... be a nice like little thing.

4139
02:37:52,750 --> 02:37:53,630
Um... every time.

4140
02:37:53,890 --> 02:37:58,230
So like... and then like when I'm using that particular outfit, I'll swap to that intro.

4141
02:37:58,890 --> 02:37:59,250
And...

4142
02:37:59,250 --> 02:38:02,210
So then you'll be like, oh she's gonna be using that new outfit today.

4143
02:38:02,870 --> 02:38:03,230
Uh...

4144
02:38:03,230 --> 02:38:05,450
So I think I might do that in the future.

4145
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:09,530
Um... I saw somebody like, when will there be updates on the discord for the Minecraft server?

4146
02:38:09,810 --> 02:38:13,410
There are a few of us with technical difficulties and we don't know where to turn it.

4147
02:38:13,450 --> 02:38:13,630
Soon!

4148
02:38:15,790 --> 02:38:16,150
Um...

4149
02:38:16,150 --> 02:38:17,230
I was supposed to make it yesterday.

4150
02:38:17,570 --> 02:38:18,630
But then I fell asleep.

4151
02:38:18,750 --> 02:38:19,230
I'm sorry.

4152
02:38:22,070 --> 02:38:24,710
It will be made either today or tomorrow!

4153
02:38:25,130 --> 02:38:29,770
We're gonna be implementing the new chat update like either... I think tomorrow?

4154
02:38:30,090 --> 02:38:30,770
Oh my gosh!

4155
02:38:30,950 --> 02:38:33,670
Okay, speaking of the Minecraft update, uh...

4156
02:38:33,670 --> 02:38:34,610
the Minecraft server update.

4157
02:38:34,810 --> 02:38:38,070
They are making a coliseum for you guys to fight each other.

4158
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:40,530
So let me show you guys a picture of it.

4159
02:38:40,590 --> 02:38:43,490
They actually sent me like an update progress of it.

4160
02:38:43,590 --> 02:38:45,710
Uh... where is it?

4161
02:38:45,790 --> 02:38:48,050
Where's the... Doki server?

4162
02:38:48,410 --> 02:38:48,870
Oh my god.

4163
02:38:48,910 --> 02:38:49,090

4164
02:38:49,170 --> 02:38:49,610
I'll show you guys.

4165
02:38:49,630 --> 02:38:52,330
They're making a coliseum right now.

4166
02:38:53,190 --> 02:38:53,590
Um...

4167
02:38:54,330 --> 02:38:55,990
So you guys can fight it out.

4168
02:38:56,130 --> 02:38:57,510
So like I said, we're getting like regular...

4169
02:38:57,510 --> 02:38:58,930
We're gonna be getting regular updates for this.

4170
02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,670
Look!

4171
02:38:59,970 --> 02:39:01,470
There's gonna be a coliseum.

4172
02:39:01,630 --> 02:39:02,030
Guys.

4173
02:39:02,330 --> 02:39:05,130
You guys are gonna be like... press a button and then you're gonna fight each other.

4174
02:39:05,250 --> 02:39:07,190
And you're gonna spawn in with like materials.

4175
02:39:07,410 --> 02:39:09,650
Like with... uh... with already like...

4176
02:39:09,650 --> 02:39:11,050
And then you gotta do teams too.

4177
02:39:11,170 --> 02:39:15,990
So there's gonna be like teams and stuff for the battles... battle coliseum.

4178
02:39:16,050 --> 02:39:18,210
Like this is just whoever wants to challenge each other.

4179
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:19,330
And just like...

02:39:19,630 --> 02:39:21,350

4182
02:39:23,550 --> 02:39:24,410
like updates.

4183
02:39:24,630 --> 02:39:26,210
That and also the chatting system.

4184
02:39:26,450 --> 02:39:27,930
Uh... a better chatting system.

4185
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:32,990
Um... so that you can chat with just your factions or like with particular groups that you started with.

4186
02:39:33,390 --> 02:39:33,870
Um...

4187
02:39:33,870 --> 02:39:34,370
Yeah!

4188
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:35,390
And...

4189
02:39:35,390 --> 02:39:37,210
so like that's like... uh...

4190
02:39:37,210 --> 02:39:40,150
that's like one of the huge updates that we're gonna be doing.

4191
02:39:40,330 --> 02:39:42,690
The server will be up whenever...

4192
02:39:43,770 --> 02:39:46,670
if... whenever I finish my other work and I can make the server today.

4193
02:39:46,890 --> 02:39:47,430
Or tomorrow.

4194
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:51,550

4195
02:39:51,550 --> 02:39:54,990

So... don't worry.

4197
02:40:01,430 --> 02:40:02,270
We'll get there.

4198
02:40:02,990 --> 02:40:04,730
There's a long to-do list.

4199
02:40:04,950 --> 02:40:07,550
I made a to-do list and we're very slowly getting there.

4200
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:08,150
We're...

4201

Aqua, I'm not even gonna read your super chat but...

4217

I would say thank you for the super chat but there's a reason why we're not gonna read your super chat.

4218
02:40:44,930 --> 02:40:46,150

4239
02:41:13,630 --> 02:41:16,410
I mean hoping for a UK con appearance in the future.

4240
02:41:16,510 --> 02:41:17,310
Thank you for the super chat.

4241
02:41:17,430 --> 02:41:17,630
Thank you.

4242
02:41:17,650 --> 02:41:18,170
Thank you.

4243
02:41:18,350 --> 02:41:18,830
Not...

4244
02:41:18,830 --> 02:41:21,210
this year, I feel like.

4245
02:41:21,290 --> 02:41:22,370
I don't know if...

4246
02:41:23,130 --> 02:41:23,610
Um...

4247
02:41:24,510 --> 02:41:27,150
I don't know if there's any...

4248
02:41:27,150 --> 02:41:32,610
There's still few other conventions that haven't been announced yet.

4249
02:41:33,330 --> 02:41:35,250
But, um... for this year?

4250
02:41:36,210 --> 02:41:36,690
Uh...

4251
02:41:36,690 --> 02:41:39,210
But I'm not sure...

4252
02:41:40,190 --> 02:41:41,150
if UK...

4253
02:41:41,150 --> 02:41:42,950
I don't think UK is gonna be for this year.

4254
02:41:43,070 --> 02:41:45,130
Next year... Next year is definitely...

4255
02:41:45,150 --> 02:41:49,050
gonna be a lot more chill when it comes to convention appearance.

4256
02:41:50,190 --> 02:41:51,390
Um... because...

4257
02:41:51,390 --> 02:41:52,450
like I said...

4258
02:41:52,450 --> 02:41:53,030
Um...

4259
02:41:54,830 --> 02:41:59,670
I booked myself a lot for a lot of different conventions this year.

4260
02:41:59,870 --> 02:42:02,170
Um... because I wanted to, you know...

4261
02:42:02,170 --> 02:42:04,450
I never had the chance to...

4262
02:42:04,450 --> 02:42:10,730
to be able to visit so many different places around the world in terms of meeting my dragoons.

4263
02:42:10,910 --> 02:42:12,630
So that's why I went super...

4264
02:42:12,970 --> 02:42:14,050
like hardcore mode.

4265
02:42:14,330 --> 02:42:14,930
Um...

4266
02:42:15,150 --> 02:42:16,990
because like... I said yes to a lot.

4267
02:42:19,390 --> 02:42:20,710
I said yes...

4268
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:22,310
uh... to a lot of places.

4269
02:42:22,670 --> 02:42:26,510
Because like I know there's a lot of places that never had a chance to meet me in the past.

4270
02:42:26,890 --> 02:42:30,870
And like, you know, I'm trying to catch up with Lost Time with all of you guys.

4271
02:42:32,450 --> 02:42:32,850
Um...

4272
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:34,870
To be able to like...

4273
02:42:34,870 --> 02:42:36,830
uh... have this opportunity because...

4274
02:42:36,830 --> 02:42:39,270
I don't know if I'm gonna have this opportunity again in the future.

4275
02:42:39,890 --> 02:42:41,310
Uh... so that's why I was like...

4276
02:42:41,310 --> 02:42:42,570
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

4277
02:42:42,750 --> 02:42:43,150
Uh...

4278
02:42:46,630 --> 02:42:47,190
So...

4279
02:42:47,190 --> 02:42:50,770
Um... I... for next year though, I'm definitely gonna...

4280
02:42:50,770 --> 02:42:56,590
I'm gonna try to pick places or conventions maybe that I haven't done before.

4281
02:42:56,770 --> 02:42:57,750
For next year.

4282
02:42:57,930 --> 02:42:59,950
Like that's gonna be my main priority.

4283
02:43:00,850 --> 02:43:01,410
Um...

4284
02:43:01,410 --> 02:43:08,670
To focus on more so on like places and conventions that I haven't done or like specific conventions that I haven't done before.

4285
02:43:08,870 --> 02:43:10,490
That doesn't mean I won't do like repeat conventions.

4286
02:43:10,830 --> 02:43:13,930
I might consider repeating some... a few conventions.

4287
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:15,090
Um...

4288
02:43:15,150 --> 02:43:19,130
But my priority is definitely gonna be picking new places for next year.

4289
02:43:19,770 --> 02:43:25,030
Um... because you know I wanna be able to meet as many dragoons who's never had a chance to meet me before.

4290
02:43:25,230 --> 02:43:25,610
You know?

4291
02:43:25,710 --> 02:43:27,290
Like that's like my main goal.

4292
02:43:27,470 --> 02:43:28,870
To meet... uh...

4293
02:43:28,870 --> 02:43:31,730
To give dragoons an opportunity to meet me.

4294
02:43:31,950 --> 02:43:33,030
To like...

4295
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:34,430
be able to see me and everything.

4296
02:43:34,830 --> 02:43:35,830
And... yeah!

4297
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:38,270
That's how I wanna go on for next year as well.

4298
02:43:40,290 --> 02:43:40,770
Um...

4299
02:43:40,770 --> 02:43:41,130
Alright.

4300
02:43:41,310 --> 02:43:44,190
Where... where am I on my Super Chats list?

4301
02:43:44,570 --> 02:43:45,210
Oh my god.

4302
02:43:45,230 --> 02:43:45,990
It's been so long.

4303
02:43:46,130 --> 02:43:49,110

4339
02:44:22,110 --> 02:44:22,670
Long pause.

4345
02:44:27,510 --> 02:44:27,850
Thank you.

4346
02:44:27,910 --> 02:44:32,090
Are you caramel or car-mel kind of pronounced its car-mel.

4347
02:44:32,270 --> 02:44:34,150
I pronounce it car-mel though right way.

4348
02:44:34,570 --> 02:44:36,330
Thank you for the Super Chat.

4349
02:44:36,410 --> 02:44:37,510
Thank you, Thank you.

4350
02:44:38,390 --> 02:44:38,790
Brody!

4351
02:44:39,010 --> 02:44:40,590
We had money for college.

4352
02:44:40,830 --> 02:44:42,650
Yeah, we had money for college.

4353
02:44:43,090 --> 02:44:44,410
Good catch, good catch.

4354
02:44:44,630 --> 02:44:46,710
We're not getting that deposit back, guys.

4355
02:44:46,810 --> 02:44:47,090
I don't...

4356
02:44:47,730 --> 02:44:50,210
Guys, I don't think we're gonna get that deposit back, guys.

4357
02:44:53,050 --> 02:44:56,250
Oh my god, did you guys see the Junji Ito Sanrio collab?

4358
02:44:57,150 --> 02:44:58,990
Oh my god, I was like...

4359
02:44:58,990 --> 02:44:59,270
But...

4360
02:44:59,790 --> 02:45:00,970
That was like...

4361
02:45:00,970 --> 02:45:06,590
That was like one of the craziest crossovers I've ever seen.

4362
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:07,690
Like, it just...

4363
02:45:07,690 --> 02:45:10,470
I don't know, did it make it that...

4364
02:45:10,470 --> 02:45:15,470
Okay, it makes a lot of sense, but also it didn't make a lot of sense.

4365
02:45:15,550 --> 02:45:19,370
It makes a lot of sense because Junji Ito is...

4366
02:45:20,690 --> 02:45:21,590
Loves cats.

4367
02:45:22,050 --> 02:45:24,010
Like, he is obsessed with cats.

4368
02:45:24,130 --> 02:45:27,290
He has like a comedy slice of life...

4369
02:45:28,170 --> 02:45:29,330
Slice of life manga.

4370
02:45:30,830 --> 02:45:34,190
That's just like dedicated to like living with his cats.

4371
02:45:34,390 --> 02:45:39,230
But then he has like the craziest like horror shit ever.

4372
02:45:40,470 --> 02:45:40,950
Yeah.

4373
02:45:42,710 --> 02:45:43,890
Okay, guys.

4374
02:45:44,130 --> 02:45:45,070
It's just...

4375
02:45:45,070 --> 02:45:47,370
Oh my god, it's like a pop-up store.

4376
02:45:47,490 --> 02:45:48,930
Wait, I'll show you guys the picture because I can.

4377
02:45:51,430 --> 02:45:52,530
I don't know.

4378
02:45:52,630 --> 02:45:54,110
I don't know how I feel about it.

4379
02:45:54,270 --> 02:45:57,210
Like, I love Junji Ito and I love Sanrio.

4380
02:45:57,390 --> 02:45:58,430
But like...

4381
02:45:58,430 --> 02:45:59,810
I don't know.

4382
02:46:05,390 --> 02:46:06,610
I don't know.

4383
02:46:06,610 --> 02:46:08,730
I don't feel about this.

4384
02:46:11,290 --> 02:46:13,250
It's definitely like a combo.

4385
02:46:13,470 --> 02:46:14,510
I like...

4386
02:46:14,510 --> 02:46:16,350
Wait, does Cinnamoroll not have eyes?

4387
02:46:16,550 --> 02:46:17,430
Oh my god.

4388
02:46:17,550 --> 02:46:18,270
Did they like...

4389
02:46:18,270 --> 02:46:19,130
What the fuck?

4390
02:46:19,770 --> 02:46:20,210
They...

4391
02:46:20,210 --> 02:46:21,450
Oh my god, they even...

4392
02:46:21,450 --> 02:46:22,390
Oh my god.

4393
02:46:22,670 --> 02:46:23,670
They made...

4394
02:46:23,670 --> 02:46:24,050
What?

4395
02:46:24,330 --> 02:46:25,550
He has no eyes.

4396
02:46:26,450 --> 02:46:27,190
Wait a minute.

4397
02:46:27,810 --> 02:46:28,590
Oh my god.

4398
02:46:28,630 --> 02:46:29,610
Wait, this is the merch.

4399
02:46:30,110 --> 02:46:31,250
He has no eyes.

4400
02:46:32,030 --> 02:46:33,250
Okay, look at the merch.

4401
02:46:33,850 --> 02:46:34,830
Can I even...

4402
02:46:34,830 --> 02:46:35,950
Can I even drag this?

4403
02:46:36,110 --> 02:46:36,310
No!

4404
02:46:37,350 --> 02:46:38,430
I need to snip it.

4405
02:46:38,590 --> 02:46:39,550
I can't drag it.

4406
02:46:39,550 --> 02:46:40,410
I can only snip it.

4407
02:46:40,450 --> 02:46:40,910
Give me a sec.

4408
02:46:42,030 --> 02:46:43,250
It's a web file.

4409
02:46:43,490 --> 02:46:45,310
No, not a web file.

4410
02:46:45,930 --> 02:46:46,450
Alright.

4411
02:46:48,130 --> 02:46:49,150
Guys, look at this.

4412
02:46:49,510 --> 02:46:51,010
Look at this Cinnamoroll.

4413
02:46:51,350 --> 02:46:52,710
Why does he have no pupils?

4414
02:46:54,530 --> 02:46:55,770
Why do the...

4415
02:46:55,770 --> 02:46:57,810
Why do the women have pupils?

4416
02:47:00,290 --> 02:47:01,090
Oh my god.

4417
02:47:04,490 --> 02:47:06,270
Where did the pupils go?

4418
02:47:07,030 --> 02:47:07,910
Holy shit.

4419
02:47:10,130 --> 02:47:11,810
Oh my god.

4420
02:47:11,890 --> 02:47:13,170
Spooky Cinnamoroll.

4421
02:47:13,390 --> 02:47:14,610
That's so spooky.

4422
02:47:14,950 --> 02:47:18,290
It's like, it's literally a spooky Cinnamoroll.

4423
02:47:18,590 --> 02:47:19,050
Wait!

4424
02:47:19,210 --> 02:47:20,030
What the fuck?

4425
02:47:20,790 --> 02:47:23,030
I just, oh my god.

4426
02:47:23,380 --> 02:47:24,190
Wait a ju...

4427
02:47:25,670 --> 02:47:27,330
Wait, what the fuck?

4428
02:47:27,450 --> 02:47:29,270
I just noticed this.

4429
02:47:29,550 --> 02:47:30,970
Oh my god!

4430
02:47:36,270 --> 02:47:37,670
I really...

4431
02:47:37,670 --> 02:47:39,630
I just noticed that!

4432
02:47:44,190 --> 02:47:47,410
Yeah, they added the Two-Faced Lady.

4433
02:47:48,610 --> 02:47:54,490
What the f- They added the Two-Faced Lady!

4434
02:47:58,810 --> 02:48:00,190
Okayoni, thank you for the super chat!

4435
02:48:00,250 --> 02:48:00,510
Thank you!

4436
02:48:00,610 --> 02:48:04,450
Just want to take the chance to thank you again for coming to Anime North Tokyo.

4437
02:48:04,570 --> 02:48:06,950
It was my first convention ever, so seeing you made it very special!

4438
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:07,890
Thank you for the super chat!

4439
02:48:07,990 --> 02:48:08,150
Thank you!

4440
02:48:08,570 --> 02:48:12,670
I'm glad I made it feel super special.

4441
02:48:13,010 --> 02:48:17,750
And honestly, I love meeting all my dragons during these convention appearances.

4442
02:48:17,870 --> 02:48:20,610
Like I said, I'm trying to include as many different places as possible.

4443
02:48:20,950 --> 02:48:23,910
Because I know for a lot of you guys- I'm sorry.

4444
02:48:24,050 --> 02:48:25,210
I'm sorry, South America.

4445
02:48:25,490 --> 02:48:26,350
I'm so sorry.

4446
02:48:33,370 --> 02:48:36,070
Spam your convention organizers to invite me!

4447
02:48:39,210 --> 02:48:48,690
But I'm trying my best to include as many places as possible so you guys can come and meet me.

4448
02:48:54,270 --> 02:48:57,410
But what the- I'm just so surprised!

4449
02:48:57,830 --> 02:49:02,010
I never expected Junji Ito to collab with Sanrio!

4450
02:49:02,770 --> 02:49:15,550
Of all- I don't know, it's such a- It's such a wild collab in general for me because it's like- It's like- It's such- It's just- I get like Hello Kitty, but still.

4451
02:49:19,790 --> 02:49:22,510
It's still like- It's a collab I never expected.

4452
02:49:23,370 --> 02:49:25,150
It's gonna- I don't know.

4453
02:49:25,510 --> 02:49:28,130
Junji Ito has a lot of really crazy fans.

4454
02:49:28,650 --> 02:49:33,830
Like, as in like- Junji- Like the fans are incredibly fanatic about Junji Ito.

4455
02:49:34,610 --> 02:49:38,930
But they don't- I guess like- I mean, I like Junji Ito and I like Sanrio.

4456
02:49:39,190 --> 02:49:42,530
But like, I would never expected them to do a collab together.

4457
02:49:45,530 --> 02:49:51,550
So it's- It's quite- It's quite- I was just really surprised.

4458
02:49:52,030 --> 02:49:53,790
I don't know how to explain it.

4459
02:49:53,870 --> 02:49:54,890
I was like, whoa.

4460
02:49:56,570 --> 02:49:56,750
Whoa.

4461
02:49:56,750 --> 02:49:56,830
Whoa.

4462
02:49:57,690 --> 02:49:58,170
Whoa.

4463
02:50:01,410 --> 02:50:02,110
Let's see.

4464
02:50:02,110 --> 02:50:04,830
Uh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

4465
02:50:05,110 --> 02:50:06,690
Uh, Neffy, thank you for the super chat.

4466
02:50:06,770 --> 02:50:06,990
Thank you.

4467
02:50:06,990 --> 02:50:07,530
Thank you.

4468
02:50:07,530 --> 02:50:08,030
Hey, Dokie.

4469
02:50:08,050 --> 02:50:09,370
I'm enjoying your Minecraft server.

4470
02:50:09,430 --> 02:50:12,190
I wanted to ask if loading houses are allowed on our land.

4471
02:50:12,210 --> 02:50:12,370
Yeah.

4472
02:50:12,570 --> 02:50:14,490
Yeah, you guys can go wild with your builds.

4473
02:50:14,510 --> 02:50:18,030
Just as long as it's not like- You know, like you're making lag machines or anything.

4474
02:50:18,170 --> 02:50:18,890
So go wild.

4475
02:50:19,090 --> 02:50:21,910
Also, we added a new command in the Minecraft server.

4476
02:50:22,070 --> 02:50:25,690
If you do slash lobby, I think it takes you to the main lobby.

4477
02:50:26,030 --> 02:50:27,170
The main lobby area.

4478
02:50:27,410 --> 02:50:31,070
So you don't have to- I'm sorry for all the people that traveled 10,000 blocks to get there.

4479
02:50:31,670 --> 02:50:31,990
Uh...

4480
02:50:32,330 --> 02:50:32,650
But...

4481
02:50:36,430 --> 02:50:37,650
Now you don't?

4482
02:50:39,670 --> 02:50:42,610
Uh, Chi, thank you for the super chat.

4483
02:50:42,730 --> 02:50:43,090
Thank you.

4484
02:50:43,110 --> 02:50:43,730
Thank you.

4485
02:50:44,030 --> 02:50:49,150
I didn't get small- odd in the meet and greet raffle for Annie Revel, but I'll definitely come to all your public panels there.

4486
02:50:49,250 --> 02:50:50,010
Thank you for the super chat.

4487
02:50:50,090 --> 02:50:50,330
Thank you.

4488
02:50:50,370 --> 02:50:50,830
Thank you.

4489
02:50:51,010 --> 02:50:51,810
Don't worry, Chi.

4490
02:50:52,790 --> 02:50:55,110
There's more than just a panel and a meet and greet.

4491
02:50:56,890 --> 02:50:57,750
That's all I can say.

4492
02:51:01,370 --> 02:51:03,350
There might be a special guest.

4493
02:51:06,530 --> 02:51:09,710
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that, but like- Whoa.

4494
02:51:14,270 --> 02:51:17,110
I might be bringing a special guest with me.

4495
02:51:18,090 --> 02:51:18,570
Um...

4496
02:51:20,930 --> 02:51:21,410
Uh...

4497
02:51:21,410 --> 02:51:22,590
Thank you for the super chat.

4498
02:51:22,670 --> 02:51:22,930
Thank you.

4499
02:51:23,170 --> 02:51:23,570
Thank you.

4500
02:51:24,590 --> 02:51:26,090
Uh... You spoiled a lot.

4501
02:51:26,090 --> 02:51:26,350
I...

4502
02:51:26,930 --> 02:51:28,350
Really gonna do...

4503
02:51:30,070 --> 02:51:31,810
I'm the boss here!

4504
02:51:33,270 --> 02:51:33,710
I...

4505
02:51:34,310 --> 02:51:36,350
I own my own...

4506
02:51:36,350 --> 02:51:37,510
I guess myself?

4507
02:51:37,830 --> 02:51:38,270
Like...

4508
02:51:38,910 --> 02:51:39,730
What I'm gonna do?

4509
02:51:40,210 --> 02:51:41,230
I'm the boss!

4510
02:51:46,250 --> 02:51:46,690
Um...

4511
02:51:48,390 --> 02:51:49,270
Let's see...

4512
02:51:49,910 --> 02:51:51,090
Uh, where was that?

4513
02:51:51,270 --> 02:51:51,710
Where...

4514
02:51:51,710 --> 02:51:53,530
Uh, Chaz, thank you for the super chat.

4515
02:51:53,610 --> 02:51:53,850
Thank you.

4516
02:51:53,850 --> 02:51:54,110
Thank you.

4517
02:51:54,190 --> 02:51:55,770
Why did you write my name on that cup?

4518
02:51:55,850 --> 02:51:56,070
I didn't.

4519
02:51:56,070 --> 02:51:56,830
I didn't order yet.

4520
02:51:56,910 --> 02:51:58,210
Thank you for the super chat.

4521
02:51:58,270 --> 02:51:58,610
Thank you.

4522
02:51:58,710 --> 02:51:59,210
Thank you.

4523
02:51:59,850 --> 02:52:00,350
Uh...

4524
02:52:03,270 --> 02:52:03,770
Uh...

4525
02:52:04,290 --> 02:52:05,370
I'm the company!

4526
02:52:06,050 --> 02:52:06,550
Exactly.

4527
02:52:06,810 --> 02:52:08,610
I am the company.

4528
02:52:12,950 --> 02:52:13,450
Uh...

4529
02:52:13,860 --> 02:52:14,850
Boytan, thank you for the super chat.

4530
02:52:14,930 --> 02:52:15,130
Thank you.

4531
02:52:15,150 --> 02:52:15,570
Thank you.

4532
02:52:15,910 --> 02:52:16,410
Double...

4533
02:52:16,410 --> 02:52:17,050
Restretto...

4534
02:52:17,050 --> 02:52:17,490
Venti...

4535
02:52:17,490 --> 02:52:18,030
Half soy...

4536
02:52:18,030 --> 02:52:18,550
Nonfat...

4537
02:52:18,550 --> 02:52:19,110
Decaf...

4538
02:52:19,110 --> 02:52:19,610
Organic...

4539
02:52:19,610 --> 02:52:20,550
Chocolate brownie...

4540
02:52:21,390 --> 02:52:22,310
Ice vanilla...

4541
02:52:22,310 --> 02:52:25,950
Double shot... gingerbread frappuccino.

4542
02:52:26,150 --> 02:52:27,970
Extra hot with foam whipped.

4543
02:52:28,570 --> 02:52:30,570
You don't... is that real?

4544
02:52:31,350 --> 02:52:34,790
What's the craziest order that like somebody has given you?

4545
02:52:34,870 --> 02:52:36,630
Also Voitan, thank you for the super chat.

4546
02:52:36,710 --> 02:52:37,710
Thank you, thank you.

4547
02:52:38,030 --> 02:52:40,850
Also Fun, welcome to the tomato farm.

4548
02:52:40,930 --> 02:52:41,490
Welcome, welcome.

4549
02:52:42,010 --> 02:52:44,390
What's like the... any baristas in my chat?

4550
02:52:44,590 --> 02:52:48,610
What's the craziest order that like a Karen gave you?

4551
02:52:49,170 --> 02:52:51,710
What is the craziest order that you had to do?

4552
02:52:53,910 --> 02:52:55,070
I'm actually curious.

4553
02:52:56,150 --> 02:52:57,490
Like are these real people?

4554
02:52:57,690 --> 02:52:59,090
Like there's no way.

4555
02:53:00,370 --> 02:53:00,770
Where's...

4556
02:53:04,370 --> 02:53:05,770
Alan, thank you for the super chat.

4557
02:53:05,850 --> 02:53:06,590
Thank you, thank you.

4558
02:53:06,590 --> 02:53:07,470
See you in Caledonia.

4559
02:53:07,590 --> 02:53:11,350
I'm glad to know there will be more than me in Greece because I couldn't get an honor.

4560
02:53:11,430 --> 02:53:11,530
No!

4561
02:53:11,750 --> 02:53:12,770
Thank you for the super chat.

4562
02:53:13,110 --> 02:53:13,670
Alan, thank you.

4563
02:53:13,790 --> 02:53:14,390
Thank you.

4564
02:53:14,750 --> 02:53:16,910
Sorry, the raffle was limited.

4565
02:53:17,030 --> 02:53:17,930
I'm so sorry.

4566
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:18,590
I'm sorry.

4567
02:53:20,870 --> 02:53:22,190
There's a lot.

4568
02:53:24,050 --> 02:53:25,010
Even like...

4569
02:53:25,730 --> 02:53:27,310
As I know like the...

4570
02:53:27,310 --> 02:53:30,750
The Hyatt booth was also like raffled as well.

4571
02:53:31,670 --> 02:53:38,030
Like the tickets were raffled but it was so funny seeing like some of the dragoons that were just looking at the side.

4572
02:53:38,210 --> 02:53:39,370
Because they fenced it off.

4573
02:53:39,510 --> 02:53:40,290
It was so funny.

4574
02:53:40,350 --> 02:53:41,770
Like they fenced off the...

4575
02:53:42,430 --> 02:53:47,210
The booth because they don't want to overcrowd the booth area because it could be like, you know, fire hazard.

4576
02:53:47,210 --> 02:53:50,390
So then... But then they had to fence it off during like the performances.

4577
02:53:50,630 --> 02:53:55,770
But I could see like the dragoons like huddled on the side like looking in.

4578
02:53:55,910 --> 02:54:00,010
They're like, I don't have a ticket but I'm gonna... I'm gonna watch it illegally.

4579
02:54:02,430 --> 02:54:05,090
I thought that was so funny.

4580
02:54:05,230 --> 02:54:08,190
I was staring at you guys like, I'm gonna watch it illegally.

4581
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:15,520
It was really funny.

4582
02:54:15,740 --> 02:54:17,800
I could see you guys on the side.

4583
02:54:19,300 --> 02:54:21,460
Six straight expression shots?

4584
02:54:21,700 --> 02:54:22,800
Jesus Christ!

4585
02:54:23,320 --> 02:54:25,520
That is not healthy at all!

4586
02:54:28,640 --> 02:54:29,280
Let's see.

4587
02:54:30,700 --> 02:54:31,180

4588
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:31,940

4589
02:54:32,020 --> 02:54:32,240
Thank you.

4590
02:54:32,820 --> 02:54:34,220
Asi knows good coffee.

4591
02:54:35,860 --> 02:54:36,740
Wait, what?

4592
02:54:36,960 --> 02:54:38,740
They kicked out a coffee shop?

4593
02:54:39,060 --> 02:54:41,060
An experience... Oh my god!

4594
02:54:41,100 --> 02:54:41,520
Australians!

4595
02:54:41,940 --> 02:54:42,860

Thank you.

4597
02:54:45,960 --> 02:54:46,600
Let's see.

4598
02:54:46,740 --> 02:54:47,240
What else?

4599
02:54:47,240 --> 02:54:51,620
I'm gonna do three more super chats and then...

4600
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:54,380
And then we're gonna call it here.

4601
02:54:54,560 --> 02:54:56,400
Because like I said, there's a lot to do.

4602
02:54:57,080 --> 02:54:58,700
There's a lot to do.

4603
02:54:58,760 --> 02:55:00,720
I have a very long to-do list.

4604
02:55:00,820 --> 02:55:03,440
But yesterday, I passed out early yesterday.

4605
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:07,500
I've been having like an issue yesterday where I'll be like, I'm gonna take a nap.

4606
02:55:07,680 --> 02:55:09,720
And then like I... It was not a nap.

4607
02:55:13,060 --> 02:55:16,600
It's happened way too many times lately.

4608
02:55:16,600 --> 02:55:18,480
I'll be like, I'm so tired.

4609
02:55:18,580 --> 02:55:19,600
I'm gonna take a nap.

4610
02:55:19,740 --> 02:55:22,640
And then I wake up and it's like 6 in the morning.

4611
02:55:22,820 --> 02:55:24,380
And I'm like, oh no.

4612
02:55:26,100 --> 02:55:28,000
And I'm like, maybe I should get up.

4613
02:55:28,080 --> 02:55:30,440
And then I'll be like on my phone for two more hours.

4614
02:55:30,680 --> 02:55:33,500
And I'll be like, okay, now I should get up.

4615
02:55:38,360 --> 02:55:40,280
Hey, thank you for the super chat.

4616
02:55:40,360 --> 02:55:40,640
Thank you.

4617
02:55:40,640 --> 02:55:41,220
Thank you.

4618
02:55:41,260 --> 02:55:43,460
It was nice meeting you at the Dokimi panel.

4619
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:45,500
I was able to get into the middle of the group photo.

4620
02:55:45,500 --> 02:55:47,680
It's a nice reward after my seven hour trip.

4621
02:55:47,800 --> 02:55:48,900
It's almost 1 a.m.

4622
02:55:48,900 --> 02:55:49,380
on my side.

4623
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:52,780
So, F me for me and the rest of the EU dragoons, I guess.

4624
02:55:52,860 --> 02:55:53,540
Thank you for the super chat.

4625
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:53,800
Thank you.

4626
02:55:53,860 --> 02:55:54,340
Thank you.

4627
02:55:54,680 --> 02:55:56,340
I really appreciate it.

4628
02:55:56,440 --> 02:56:01,660
I'm so happy there's so many EU dragoons during the Dokimi panel.

4629
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:07,880
I was so surprised because like, you know, you guys have to wake up so early or stay up really late for my streams.

4630
02:56:09,900 --> 02:56:12,760
So, I really, really, really appreciate it, guys.

4631
02:56:12,860 --> 02:56:14,720
I'm really happy that...

4632
02:56:14,720 --> 02:56:18,220
a lot of you guys showed up during Dokimi.

4633
02:56:18,300 --> 02:56:24,600
I hope I can have meet and greets too in the future for Europe conventions.

4634
02:56:25,440 --> 02:56:27,800
Oh my god, I'm super excited for...

4635
02:56:27,800 --> 02:56:31,280
It's gonna be a one-off for the Saturday stream for Digimon.

4636
02:56:32,040 --> 02:56:34,140
Because like, that game...

4637
02:56:35,200 --> 02:56:43,120
One of my very first PlayStation 1 games was the original Digimon World that my dad got me.

4638
02:56:43,260 --> 02:56:44,620
But it was in like Japanese.

4639
02:56:44,620 --> 02:56:47,360
So like, I had no idea how to play that game.

4640
02:56:47,480 --> 02:56:48,180
I told this story before.

4641
02:56:48,420 --> 02:56:49,280
But like...

4642
02:56:50,540 --> 02:56:51,020
Um...

4643
02:56:51,020 --> 02:56:53,520
I had no idea how to play...

4644
02:56:53,520 --> 02:56:55,100
What I was doing in that game.

4645
02:56:55,280 --> 02:56:57,340
But I have a lot of good memories of it.

4646
02:56:57,460 --> 02:57:01,040
Because like, I just really loved raising the little Digimon until they died.

4647
02:57:01,220 --> 02:57:05,540
I didn't even know how to save my game.

4648
02:57:05,720 --> 02:57:08,540
I didn't know how to save my Digimon World game.

4649
02:57:08,840 --> 02:57:10,940
Because it was all in Japanese.

4650
02:57:11,740 --> 02:57:12,480
And then...

4651
02:57:12,480 --> 02:57:17,360
So every time I boot up the game, I would just like restart from the beginning.

4652
02:57:20,420 --> 02:57:23,520
It's basically like Tamagotchi, basically.

4653
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:25,720
Digimon World is basically like...

4654
02:57:25,720 --> 02:57:26,700
I don't care about...

4655
02:57:26,700 --> 02:57:27,500
I'm so sorry.

4656
02:57:27,580 --> 02:57:28,000
But I...

4657
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,440
Personally, I don't like...

4658
02:57:29,440 --> 02:57:30,200
I don't really...

4659
02:57:30,800 --> 02:57:31,360
Um...

4660
02:57:31,360 --> 02:57:33,300
I don't really like...

4661
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:34,380
I don't really care...

4662
02:57:34,380 --> 02:57:35,160
Not like, like...

4663
02:57:35,160 --> 02:57:36,460
But you know, my preference.

4664
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:37,940
I don't like RPGs.

4665
02:57:37,940 --> 02:57:39,080
Like JRPGs in general.

4666
02:57:39,320 --> 02:57:40,160
So like...

4667
02:57:40,160 --> 02:57:41,840
But I like Digimon World.

4668
02:57:41,840 --> 02:57:45,180
Like I didn't understand what the fuck is going on.

4669
02:57:45,280 --> 02:57:46,640
But I like Digimon World.

4670
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:50,100
I could not...

4671
02:57:50,100 --> 02:57:50,640
I could...

4672
02:57:50,640 --> 02:57:51,540
It's a long game.

4673
02:57:51,580 --> 02:57:52,420
Like Cyber Sleuth.

4674
02:57:52,580 --> 02:57:53,960
It's a very long...

4675
02:57:53,960 --> 02:57:55,460
Because I tried to play Cyber Sleuth.

4676
02:57:55,660 --> 02:57:56,280
Because like...

4677
02:57:56,280 --> 02:57:56,940
I was like, okay.

4678
02:57:57,100 --> 02:57:58,080
I need that itch.

4679
02:57:58,120 --> 02:58:01,700
I need to scratch Digimon World itch.

4680
02:58:01,740 --> 02:58:02,160
I need to...

4681
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:03,580
Yeah, Digimon was made...

4682
02:58:03,580 --> 02:58:04,860
Was basically the...

4683
02:58:04,860 --> 02:58:07,580
Because Tamagotchi was so popular...

4684
02:58:07,580 --> 02:58:08,560
Um...

4685
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:09,500
With like girls.

4686
02:58:09,700 --> 02:58:11,700
They made Digimon to...

4687
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:12,420
Appeal to...

4688
02:58:12,420 --> 02:58:13,980
Like to appeal to boys.

4689
02:58:14,480 --> 02:58:15,080
Um...

4690
02:58:15,080 --> 02:58:16,740
So like...

4691
02:58:16,740 --> 02:58:17,700
Digimon was...

4692
02:58:17,700 --> 02:58:19,420
Digimon was practically like...

4693
02:58:19,420 --> 02:58:20,560
The boy version.

4694
02:58:20,560 --> 02:58:23,300
The male equivalent of like Tamagotchi.

4695
02:58:23,620 --> 02:58:24,220
Um...

4696
02:58:24,220 --> 02:58:24,920
To like...

4697
02:58:24,920 --> 02:58:25,140
Yeah.

4698
02:58:25,220 --> 02:58:25,480
And...

4699
02:58:25,480 --> 02:58:25,740
Yeah.

4700
02:58:25,920 --> 02:58:26,480
And...

4701
02:58:26,480 --> 02:58:26,900
Um...

4702
02:58:26,900 --> 02:58:27,200
But yeah.

4703
02:58:27,260 --> 02:58:28,040
Basically like...

4704
02:58:28,040 --> 02:58:30,880
I've been always trying to scratch that Digimon World itch.

4705
02:58:30,880 --> 02:58:32,440
Because it's like one of my favorite games.

4706
02:58:32,860 --> 02:58:33,460
Uh...

4707
02:58:33,460 --> 02:58:34,160
Of all time.

4708
02:58:34,240 --> 02:58:37,200
Even though like I had zero understanding about what's going on.

4709
02:58:37,400 --> 02:58:37,960
Um...

4710
02:58:37,960 --> 02:58:39,920
But I just really enjoyed playing the game.

4711
02:58:40,300 --> 02:58:40,900
And...

4712
02:58:40,900 --> 02:58:41,680
I've tried to...

4713
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:42,760
I've tried other Digimon games.

4714
02:58:42,840 --> 02:58:43,260
I'm sorry.

4715
02:58:43,440 --> 02:58:43,920
But like...

4716
02:58:44,640 --> 02:58:47,580
There's not a lot of good Digimon games.

4717
02:58:47,980 --> 02:58:48,440
I don't know.

4718
02:58:48,580 --> 02:58:53,880
I don't know if you ever watched that video from like...

4719
02:58:53,880 --> 02:58:54,700
What's her name?

4720
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:55,400
Uh...

4721
02:58:55,400 --> 02:58:56,700
Jaden Animations.

4722
02:58:56,700 --> 02:58:59,240
And she was doing like this whole like...

4723
02:58:59,240 --> 02:59:02,600
I've been trying to figure out what's a good Digimon game.

4724
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:04,100
And like...

4725
02:59:04,100 --> 02:59:05,360
And like...

4726
02:59:05,360 --> 02:59:10,640
Everyone will think differently of what they consider is a good Digimon game.

4727
02:59:14,320 --> 02:59:17,600
Digimon World was my good Digimon game.

4728
02:59:17,920 --> 02:59:18,440
Um...

4729
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:19,480
And then...

4730
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:20,320
Um...

4731
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:22,860
I never played the newest version.

4732
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:24,200
This is apparently like...

4733
02:59:24,200 --> 02:59:25,080
Um...

4734
02:59:25,080 --> 02:59:25,820
Like I don't...

4735
02:59:25,820 --> 02:59:26,400
It's not like a...

4736
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:28,820
It's like a sequel to the original Digimon World.

4737
02:59:28,940 --> 02:59:30,560
And obviously it has like it's own thing too.

4738
02:59:31,160 --> 02:59:31,680
Um...

4739
02:59:31,680 --> 02:59:32,520
So like...

4740
02:59:32,520 --> 02:59:32,800
Uh...

4741
02:59:32,800 --> 02:59:33,680
It's gonna be a one off.

4742
02:59:33,900 --> 02:59:34,380
Um...

4743
02:59:35,180 --> 02:59:37,520
Because I don't think we're ever gonna beat that game.

4744
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:39,900
I read it's very hard to beat.

4745
02:59:40,260 --> 02:59:40,780
So...

4746
02:59:40,780 --> 02:59:41,660
It's very hard to beat.

4747
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:42,700
It's very grindy.

4748
02:59:42,720 --> 02:59:45,620
Because like the Digimon actually dies.

4749
02:59:46,120 --> 02:59:46,640
Um...

4750
02:59:46,640 --> 02:59:47,820
If you guys never played it before.

4751
02:59:48,140 --> 02:59:48,660
Uh...

4752
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:51,920
So like you have like a little time frame to beat the game.

4753
02:59:52,160 --> 02:59:52,380
Like...

4754
02:59:52,380 --> 02:59:55,460
It's cause like when they die you go back from zero.

4755
02:59:55,920 --> 02:59:56,440
Basically.

4756
03:00:03,500 --> 03:00:05,120
So I'm really excited.

4757
03:00:05,340 --> 03:00:06,520
Digimon is like...

4758
03:00:06,520 --> 03:00:08,700
I don't know if you guys know this but like...

4759
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:09,760
Uh...

4760
03:00:09,760 --> 03:00:10,800
It's...

4761
03:00:10,800 --> 03:00:12,260
Digimon is like...

4762
03:00:12,260 --> 03:00:12,740
Is...

4763
03:00:12,740 --> 03:00:13,360
Oh my gosh.

4764
03:00:13,440 --> 03:00:14,020
I love...

4765
03:00:14,020 --> 03:00:15,580
I love Digimon more than Pokemon.

4766
03:00:16,020 --> 03:00:16,580
I...

4767
03:00:16,580 --> 03:00:17,380
I'm gonna say it.

4768
03:00:17,580 --> 03:00:18,020
I...

4769
03:00:18,020 --> 03:00:20,400
I personally love Digimon more than Pokemon.

4770
03:00:20,740 --> 03:00:22,580
But like in the West.

4771
03:00:23,020 --> 03:00:24,920
That is like a different story.

4772
03:00:25,100 --> 03:00:26,980
Because most of the Digimon content.

4773
03:00:27,140 --> 03:00:28,840
Does not release here.

4774
03:00:29,100 --> 03:00:29,660
Hahaha.

4775
03:00:30,760 --> 03:00:31,040
Yeah.

4776
03:00:31,440 --> 03:00:32,240
Do you know.

4777
03:00:32,340 --> 03:00:35,480
Do you know where most of the Digimon content is released in?

4778
03:00:35,700 --> 03:00:37,240
It's released in China.

4779
03:00:37,500 --> 03:00:39,460
Because like people in China.

4780
03:00:39,460 --> 03:00:41,640
And I love Digimon!

4781
03:00:41,840 --> 03:00:45,240
There's so many exclusives there.

4782
03:00:45,580 --> 03:00:47,920
There's so many exclusives there.

4783
03:00:48,300 --> 03:00:52,120
And like, oh my god, the merch for it is so good too.

4784
03:00:52,640 --> 03:00:52,980
Like...

4785
03:00:54,800 --> 03:00:59,760
It's really... like there's a lot of exclusive merch made for Digimon.

4786
03:00:59,880 --> 03:01:02,380
And shows and games too.

4787
03:01:02,540 --> 03:01:05,840
There's exclusive games that just released there and everything.

4788
03:01:05,840 --> 03:01:07,700
And um...

4789
03:01:08,700 --> 03:01:11,580
NA, they just don't release Digimon stuff in NA!

4790
03:01:12,020 --> 03:01:14,160
There's just not big enough fanbase!

4791
03:01:14,300 --> 03:01:15,540
I'm just so sad!

4792
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:20,800
Like, I wish the fanbase for Digimon was bigger!

4793
03:01:25,840 --> 03:01:27,300
It's just not fair!

4794
03:01:28,660 --> 03:01:29,900
It's not fair!

4795
03:01:30,820 --> 03:01:31,920
What's my favorite Digimon?

4796
03:01:32,060 --> 03:01:33,300
Okay, this is a joke.

4797
03:01:33,380 --> 03:01:34,780
Digimon, that's my favorite.

4798
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:35,820
But like...

4799
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:37,900
I love it because... I talked about it before.

4800
03:01:38,200 --> 03:01:39,020
But like...

4801
03:01:39,020 --> 03:01:40,260
I love...

4802
03:01:40,260 --> 03:01:41,220
I...

4803
03:01:43,160 --> 03:01:44,480
I love...

4804
03:01:44,480 --> 03:01:44,940
I...

4805
03:01:45,740 --> 03:01:47,360
Okay, okay, wait, wait.

4806
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:48,720
Um...

4807
03:01:48,720 --> 03:01:49,460
I...

4808
03:01:49,460 --> 03:01:51,880
His name is Betsumon.

4809
03:01:52,160 --> 03:01:52,820
And...

4810
03:01:52,820 --> 03:01:55,900
And he's based... he's an actual Digimon.

4811
03:01:56,080 --> 03:01:59,720
And the reason why I love Betsumon...

4812
03:01:59,720 --> 03:02:02,120
Because... okay, that's just like my joke love.

4813
03:02:02,360 --> 03:02:04,900
It's not my favorite, favorite Digimon.

4814
03:02:04,900 --> 03:02:08,360
But like... he's like my favorite design.

4815
03:02:08,740 --> 03:02:10,700
Because it's so dumb.

4816
03:02:12,960 --> 03:02:18,140
He's basically... he's basically like the cosplay Digimon.

4817
03:02:18,260 --> 03:02:20,280
Like he's literally the cosplay Digimon.

4818
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:21,040
Because...

4819
03:02:27,990 --> 03:02:28,950
Because...

4820
03:02:30,490 --> 03:02:31,450
Anyway...

4821
03:02:31,450 --> 03:02:32,230
Um...

4822
03:02:33,170 --> 03:02:36,070
This is my favorite Digimon design of all time.

4823
03:02:36,310 --> 03:02:38,930
Because I... I just think it's... it's funny.

4824
03:02:39,090 --> 03:02:41,110
I just think it's really funny.

4825
03:02:42,730 --> 03:02:43,370
Um...

4826
03:02:43,370 --> 03:02:44,490
But... yeah.

4827
03:02:44,590 --> 03:02:46,350
My favorite Digimon is like...

4828
03:02:46,350 --> 03:02:47,390
Uh... Gatomon.

4829
03:02:48,310 --> 03:02:48,950
Terriormon.

4830
03:02:50,150 --> 03:02:50,790
Uh...

4831
03:02:51,550 --> 03:02:53,130
Uh... I don't like Patamon.

4832
03:02:53,170 --> 03:02:53,470
I'm sorry.

4833
03:02:53,610 --> 03:02:54,570
I... I... I...

4834
03:02:54,570 --> 03:02:55,990
I don't think...

4835
03:02:55,990 --> 03:02:57,450
I... like... I know everyone's like...

4836
03:02:57,450 --> 03:03:00,070
But Patamon is like basically like the Digimon Pikachu.

4837
03:03:00,070 --> 03:03:01,130
I...

4838
03:03:01,970 --> 03:03:02,910
Patamon's ugly.

4839
03:03:06,870 --> 03:03:09,370
I think Patamon's ugly.

4840
03:03:09,530 --> 03:03:09,970
Okay.

4841
03:03:10,150 --> 03:03:10,750
Um...

4842
03:03:10,750 --> 03:03:11,970
Anyway, I think...

4843
03:03:11,970 --> 03:03:14,250
Gabumon was one of my favorites too.

4844
03:03:14,410 --> 03:03:15,330
But then like...

4845
03:03:15,330 --> 03:03:16,290
Like I said...

4846
03:03:16,290 --> 03:03:16,850
Um...

4847
03:03:16,850 --> 03:03:20,790
Gabumon... Gabumon was ruined for me when I realized like...

4848
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:21,890
Uh...

4849
03:03:21,890 --> 03:03:23,310
How dare you.

4850
03:03:23,470 --> 03:03:25,450
I am gonna say... I'll say it again.

4851
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:28,150
I think Patamon is ugly.

4852
03:03:31,030 --> 03:03:32,190
I think...

4853
03:03:32,190 --> 03:03:32,570
I think...

4854
03:03:32,570 --> 03:03:34,850
It looks like a fucking naked mole rat.

4855
03:03:35,230 --> 03:03:35,870
Um...

4856
03:03:35,870 --> 03:03:36,910
With wings...

4857
03:03:36,910 --> 03:03:38,250
With wings on his head.

4858
03:03:39,350 --> 03:03:39,990
Um...

4859
03:03:39,990 --> 03:03:40,310
Anyway...

4860
03:03:40,730 --> 03:03:40,970
I...

4861
03:03:40,970 --> 03:03:41,450
I...

4862
03:03:41,450 --> 03:03:43,030
I used to like Gabumon.

4863
03:03:43,170 --> 03:03:45,750
But then I've realized that like...

4864
03:03:46,390 --> 03:03:47,030
Uh...

4865
03:03:47,030 --> 03:03:48,230
He has...

4866
03:03:48,230 --> 03:03:48,710
He...

4867
03:03:48,710 --> 03:03:50,910
He's like basically like a lizard.

4868
03:03:51,230 --> 03:03:55,750
Wearing a skinned Digimon on top of him.

4869
03:03:55,910 --> 03:03:56,830
And then like...

4870
03:03:56,830 --> 03:03:57,390
There's like...

4871
03:03:57,390 --> 03:04:00,050
Oh, this is what Gabumon might look like with a...

4872
03:04:00,050 --> 03:04:00,510
Without it.

4873
03:04:00,590 --> 03:04:02,050
And I'm like...

4874
03:04:03,210 --> 03:04:03,810
Uh...

4875
03:04:05,150 --> 03:04:05,750
And...

4876
03:04:08,550 --> 03:04:09,710
And then like...

4877
03:04:09,710 --> 03:04:11,710
I stopped loving Gabumon.

4878
03:04:11,890 --> 03:04:12,490
I...

4879
03:04:12,490 --> 03:04:14,190
I can never love him again.

4880
03:04:14,710 --> 03:04:15,310
Um...

4881
03:04:15,310 --> 03:04:16,470
But for those who don't know...

4882
03:04:16,470 --> 03:04:17,990
I showed this on stream before but...

4883
03:04:17,990 --> 03:04:21,170
This is what Gabumon could look like without...

4884
03:04:21,170 --> 03:04:22,270
Without the...

4885
03:04:22,270 --> 03:04:23,510
Without his...

4886
03:04:23,510 --> 03:04:24,250
Like pelt on.

4887
03:04:24,550 --> 03:04:26,470
I'm just like...

4888
03:04:26,470 --> 03:04:27,290
Uh...

4889
03:04:27,290 --> 03:04:27,850
But...

4890
03:04:27,850 --> 03:04:28,830
I love him.

4891
03:04:28,830 --> 03:04:29,450
I love him.

4892
03:04:29,450 --> 03:04:30,030
I love him.

4893
03:04:30,030 --> 03:04:30,890
Ugh, brother!

4894
03:04:31,190 --> 03:04:31,750
Ugh!

4895
03:04:37,890 --> 03:04:39,290
Anyway, uh...

4896
03:04:40,830 --> 03:04:43,690
But yes, and I like... oh, I like the...

4897
03:04:43,690 --> 03:04:45,010
I like, uh...

4898
03:04:45,010 --> 03:04:47,010
I like all of...

4899
03:04:47,010 --> 03:04:49,970
I think peak design...

4900
03:04:49,970 --> 03:04:51,250
Gen 3.

4901
03:04:51,470 --> 03:04:53,610
Gen 3 Digimon, peak design.

4902
03:04:54,030 --> 03:04:56,190
Digimon Tamers, all of them...

4903
03:04:56,190 --> 03:04:57,710
except for the little, like...

4904
03:04:57,710 --> 03:04:58,570
Imp guy.

4905
03:04:59,350 --> 03:05:00,670
Uh, peak designs.

4906
03:05:01,070 --> 03:05:01,490
I'm sorry.

4907
03:05:01,570 --> 03:05:03,210
I don't know anybody that actually likes that guy.

4908
03:05:03,430 --> 03:05:03,890
Like...

4909
03:05:04,990 --> 03:05:07,650
Digimon Tamers, best designs overall.

4910
03:05:08,110 --> 03:05:11,570
But like, except for that fucking Imp guy, whoever... I forgot his name.

4911
03:05:11,690 --> 03:05:13,670
But like... Impmon!

4912
03:05:16,950 --> 03:05:19,090
People love Impmon.

4913
03:05:19,570 --> 03:05:21,250
I'm not one of them.

4914
03:05:21,390 --> 03:05:22,650
I think he's...

4915
03:05:23,470 --> 03:05:25,350
Like, he has a good... okay.

4916
03:05:25,610 --> 03:05:29,790
You can say he's a good character, or I'll say... he's a...

4917
03:05:29,790 --> 03:05:33,510
good character, but like, I hate his design.

4918
03:05:33,930 --> 03:05:35,710
Like, you can't... I don't care.

4919
03:05:36,090 --> 03:05:37,350
I don't care.

4920
03:05:38,650 --> 03:05:41,170
He might be the best...

4921
03:05:41,170 --> 03:05:43,790
maybe like one of the best character developed...

4922
03:05:43,790 --> 03:05:44,430
uh...

4923
03:05:44,430 --> 03:05:47,630
character developed Digimon in the show.

4924
03:05:47,930 --> 03:05:49,070
But like...

4925
03:05:49,070 --> 03:05:50,750
I just don't like his design.

4926
03:05:50,970 --> 03:05:51,390
I'm sorry.

4927
03:05:51,770 --> 03:05:52,270
Like...

4928
03:05:52,270 --> 03:05:54,830
I just don't like his design!

4929
03:05:55,690 --> 03:05:57,110
Uh... No name.

4930
03:05:57,710 --> 03:05:58,630
Super Chat, thank you.

4931
03:05:58,710 --> 03:06:00,110
Your tomato without your skin...

4932
03:06:00,110 --> 03:06:02,310
Yeah, but at least I look hot as a tomato.

4933
03:06:02,670 --> 03:06:03,170
Like...

4934
03:06:06,190 --> 03:06:09,830
At least I don't have a double chin as a tomato.

4935
03:06:10,210 --> 03:06:11,950
Thank you, Super Chat.

4936
03:06:12,070 --> 03:06:13,690
Thank you, no name.

4937
03:06:14,410 --> 03:06:14,950
Um...

4938
03:06:15,550 --> 03:06:17,210
It's just all head.

4939
03:06:23,510 --> 03:06:24,970
It's just all...

4940
03:06:24,970 --> 03:06:26,210
one head.

4941
03:06:26,890 --> 03:06:27,430
Um...

4942
03:06:28,970 --> 03:06:30,050
Let's see...

4943
03:06:30,050 --> 03:06:31,250
Um...

4944
03:06:31,250 --> 03:06:33,030
What else do I wanna say?

4945
03:06:33,270 --> 03:06:34,390
What else do I wanna say?

4946
03:06:35,490 --> 03:06:36,290
Um... But yeah.

4947
03:06:36,490 --> 03:06:39,370
I wish there was more Digimon content in...

4948
03:06:39,370 --> 03:06:40,930
Um... In the West.

4949
03:06:41,350 --> 03:06:41,990
But...

4950
03:06:41,990 --> 03:06:44,270
It's just not popular enough.

4951
03:06:44,390 --> 03:06:46,690
Because like, Pokemon has such a monopoly.

4952
03:06:47,530 --> 03:06:49,770
Pokemon has such a monopoly here...

4953
03:06:50,350 --> 03:06:51,310
That like...

4954
03:06:51,310 --> 03:06:53,490
It's so hard for Digimon to like...

4955
03:06:53,490 --> 03:06:54,030
do anything.

4956
03:06:54,330 --> 03:06:55,830
Which sucks!

4957
03:06:56,410 --> 03:06:57,370
It sucks!

4958
03:06:57,710 --> 03:06:58,730
Cause like...

4959
03:06:58,730 --> 03:07:00,890
I like the designs more.

4960
03:07:00,970 --> 03:07:02,870
I think Digimon has better designs!

4961
03:07:03,330 --> 03:07:05,190
I honestly think...

4962
03:07:05,350 --> 03:07:07,390
Digimon designs look...

4963
03:07:07,390 --> 03:07:09,750
a lot better than like...

4964
03:07:09,750 --> 03:07:10,770
Pokemon designs.

4965
03:07:12,950 --> 03:07:13,910
Like...

4966
03:07:13,910 --> 03:07:15,890
They have guns!

4967
03:07:15,890 --> 03:07:17,130
For arms!

4968
03:07:17,230 --> 03:07:18,770
That's so badass!

4969
03:07:22,290 --> 03:07:24,210
They have...

4970
03:07:24,850 --> 03:07:27,370
You'll never see a Pokemon with a gun!

4971
03:07:29,530 --> 03:07:30,090
Blade!

4972
03:07:30,250 --> 03:07:31,310
Thank you for the...

4973
03:07:31,990 --> 03:07:33,110
Magenta Supa!

4974
03:07:33,230 --> 03:07:33,610
Thank you!

4975
03:07:34,170 --> 03:07:36,210
Digimon Frontier is the one that has like...

4976
03:07:36,210 --> 03:07:37,910
Power Rangers mixed with...

4977
03:07:37,910 --> 03:07:39,270
Mixed with Digimon.

4978
03:07:39,450 --> 03:07:41,150
Is that the one that like... sucked?

4979
03:07:41,930 --> 03:07:42,490
Oh...

4980
03:07:43,850 --> 03:07:44,410
Sorry!

4981
03:07:44,810 --> 03:07:45,250
Blade!

4982
03:07:45,310 --> 03:07:46,770
Thank you for the Magenta Supa!

4983
03:07:47,990 --> 03:07:48,550
Um...

4984
03:07:49,730 --> 03:07:50,850
I personally...

4985
03:07:50,850 --> 03:07:52,030
I like...

4986
03:07:52,030 --> 03:07:54,850
Had no like... I didn't hate Digimon Frontier...

4987
03:07:55,370 --> 03:07:56,270
But like...

4988
03:07:56,270 --> 03:07:57,930
Digimon Frontier like...

4989
03:07:57,930 --> 03:08:00,170
Killed the franchise in the west apparently.

4990
03:08:00,690 --> 03:08:01,110
I...

4991
03:08:01,110 --> 03:08:03,530
Cause there's no actual Digimon!

4992
03:08:03,710 --> 03:08:04,630
It was just kids!

4993
03:08:04,990 --> 03:08:08,910
There was no actual Digimon!

4994
03:08:09,070 --> 03:08:09,390
It's like...

4995
03:08:09,390 --> 03:08:10,850
They are the Digimon!

4996
03:08:10,950 --> 03:08:12,770
I'm like... I don't fucking care about...

4997
03:08:12,770 --> 03:08:14,610
Them as the Digimon!

4998
03:08:15,470 --> 03:08:16,750
I want...

4999
03:08:16,750 --> 03:08:19,410
I want real Digimon!

5000
03:08:19,470 --> 03:08:20,110
I like...

5001
03:08:20,850 --> 03:08:21,950
I hate Digimon Frontier!

5002
03:08:22,110 --> 03:08:24,470
I was like... I didn't like... hate it!

5003
03:08:24,650 --> 03:08:27,130
I was just like... I was okay with it!

5004
03:08:27,250 --> 03:08:28,130
Obviously like...

5005
03:08:28,130 --> 03:08:30,070
They had to follow after Tamers!

5006
03:08:30,110 --> 03:08:32,310
And Tamers was like... the shit!

5007
03:08:32,570 --> 03:08:34,730
Like Tamers was like... basically like...

5008
03:08:34,730 --> 03:08:36,330
Hardcore... like...

5009
03:08:36,590 --> 03:08:36,910
Digimon.

5010
03:08:36,990 --> 03:08:38,490
While Pokemon was still like...

5011
03:08:38,490 --> 03:08:39,310
Ash is still 10!

5012
03:08:39,630 --> 03:08:40,430
And like...

5013
03:08:40,430 --> 03:08:42,670
Still... like... Ash is still 10!

5014
03:08:42,790 --> 03:08:44,590
And like... death isn't real!

5015
03:08:44,830 --> 03:08:46,250
In the Pokemon Universe!

5016
03:08:46,630 --> 03:08:48,310
Like people die in Tamers!

5017
03:08:48,330 --> 03:08:49,430
So like... haha!

5018
03:08:49,610 --> 03:08:50,830
And then Digimon Tamers...

5019
03:08:50,850 --> 03:08:52,050
Came out and they're like...

5020
03:08:52,050 --> 03:08:53,210
Death's real yo!

5021
03:08:57,010 --> 03:08:58,350
Digimon can die!

5022
03:08:58,910 --> 03:09:00,370
I was like...

5023
03:09:00,370 --> 03:09:01,590
What the fuck!

5024
03:09:04,630 --> 03:09:06,810
And I was a little... I was a little child!

5025
03:09:07,190 --> 03:09:08,850
I was just like... what the fuck!

5026
03:09:09,350 --> 03:09:10,190
You mean...

5027
03:09:10,190 --> 03:09:11,390
Death is real?

5028
03:09:12,190 --> 03:09:12,670
Hahaha!

5029
03:09:14,190 --> 03:09:14,670
Hahaha!

5030
03:09:17,810 --> 03:09:18,770
Um... 73!

5045
03:09:38,150 --> 03:09:39,030

Uh... Deputymon...

5050
03:09:43,090 --> 03:09:45,090
And... uh... Gundramon...

5051
03:09:45,090 --> 03:09:46,150
Are peak designs!

5052
03:09:46,490 --> 03:09:47,590
Changed my mind!

5053
03:09:48,130 --> 03:09:48,370
Pug!

5054
03:09:48,410 --> 03:09:49,130

Thank you!

5057
03:09:49,930 --> 03:09:50,650
Oh true!

5058
03:09:50,850 --> 03:09:51,890
He's like an actual gun!

5059
03:09:52,290 --> 03:09:52,730
Yeah!

5060
03:09:52,790 --> 03:09:54,970
For those who don't know, Deputymon is literally gun!

5061
03:09:55,910 --> 03:09:56,350
Hahaha!

5062
03:09:56,350 --> 03:09:56,790
Wait!

5063
03:09:57,010 --> 03:09:58,610
I forgot about that!

5064
03:09:58,750 --> 03:09:59,110
Hahaha!

5065
03:10:00,350 --> 03:10:01,790
Pokemon would never!

5066
03:10:02,150 --> 03:10:02,590
Hahaha!

5067
03:10:05,430 --> 03:10:05,870
Okay!

5068
03:10:06,090 --> 03:10:07,050
For those who don't know...

5069
03:10:07,050 --> 03:10:08,030
What... what...

5070
03:10:09,030 --> 03:10:09,810
Deputymon!

5071
03:10:09,810 --> 03:10:10,170
Look!

5072
03:10:10,230 --> 03:10:12,030
I forgot about Deputymon!

5073
03:10:12,310 --> 03:10:13,030
Hahaha!

5074
03:10:15,090 --> 03:10:17,750
That makes him So cool!

5075
03:10:18,130 --> 03:10:19,310
He's so cool!

5076
03:10:19,630 --> 03:10:20,210
Hahaha!

5077
03:10:21,110 --> 03:10:22,070
Hahaha!

5078
03:10:22,730 --> 03:10:23,210
Okay!

5079
03:10:23,950 --> 03:10:24,910
Um...

5080
03:10:24,910 --> 03:10:25,390
Hahaha!

5081
03:10:26,630 --> 03:10:28,050
Oh my god!

5082
03:10:28,210 --> 03:10:28,790
Anyway...

5083
03:10:28,790 --> 03:10:29,930
Where was I?

5084
03:10:30,910 --> 03:10:32,090
Uh... Hahaha!

5085
03:10:32,870 --> 03:10:34,970
I'm looking at Deputymon again!

5086
03:10:35,170 --> 03:10:35,890
Hahaha!

5087
03:10:36,970 --> 03:10:37,450
Okay!

5088
03:10:37,650 --> 03:10:38,310
Uh...

5089
03:10:39,710 --> 03:10:40,630
That's just...

5090
03:10:40,630 --> 03:10:43,390
That's peak Digimon right there!

5091
03:10:43,510 --> 03:10:44,450
What about Gundramon?

5092
03:10:44,550 --> 03:10:46,630
Was Gundramon the one with all guns?

5093
03:10:47,070 --> 03:10:47,930
Is that it?

5094
03:10:49,430 --> 03:10:50,070
Uh...

5095
03:10:51,290 --> 03:10:52,350
Let's see...

5096
03:10:53,130 --> 03:10:54,490
Oh my god!

5097
03:10:54,690 --> 03:10:54,950
Oh!

5098
03:10:54,950 --> 03:10:55,290
I remember!

5099
03:10:55,610 --> 03:10:56,990
I remember Gundramon!

5100
03:10:57,130 --> 03:10:57,330
Hahaha!

5101
03:10:57,650 --> 03:10:58,270
I remember!

5102
03:10:59,010 --> 03:11:00,450
I'm like... Nevermind!

5103
03:11:00,810 --> 03:11:01,890
I... Hahaha!

5104
03:11:03,010 --> 03:11:06,070
Guys, I remember what Gundramon looks like guys!

5105
03:11:06,070 --> 03:11:07,490
I remember that!

5106
03:11:08,010 --> 03:11:11,530
Okay, for those who don't know what Gundramon looks like, this is...

5107
03:11:11,890 --> 03:11:13,110
This is Gundramon.

5108
03:11:14,010 --> 03:11:16,310
This is... more guns.

5109
03:11:17,010 --> 03:11:17,990
Right here.

5110
03:11:18,430 --> 03:11:18,950
Hahaha!

5111
03:11:18,990 --> 03:11:19,830
This is...

5112
03:11:19,830 --> 03:11:22,410
This is... This is Gundramon.

5113
03:11:22,910 --> 03:11:23,550
Um...

5114
03:11:24,750 --> 03:11:26,370
Anyway... I wish...

5115
03:11:26,370 --> 03:11:28,610
I wish there was more Digimon.

5116
03:11:28,690 --> 03:11:29,730
I really do.

5117
03:11:30,010 --> 03:11:34,990
I... I love Digimon so much, but there's just not enough Digimon content.

5118
03:11:35,170 --> 03:11:35,770
Like...

5119
03:11:36,070 --> 03:11:37,050
There's nothing we can do.

5120
03:11:37,510 --> 03:11:38,070
Hahaha!

5121
03:11:39,350 --> 03:11:39,910
Hahaha!

5122
03:11:42,130 --> 03:11:43,730
That's the American...

5123
03:11:43,730 --> 03:11:44,850
Oh my gosh!

5124
03:11:44,970 --> 03:11:45,350
I remember!

5125
03:11:45,570 --> 03:11:47,530
What stream was it?

5126
03:11:47,710 --> 03:11:48,270
Oh!

5127
03:11:48,590 --> 03:11:49,490
It was with Hiro!

5128
03:11:49,790 --> 03:11:50,230
Yeah!

5129
03:11:50,650 --> 03:11:51,610
It's so funny!

5130
03:11:51,770 --> 03:11:54,010
I think my favorite... I always love how like...

5131
03:11:54,010 --> 03:11:55,830
When I talk about Digimon...

5132
03:11:55,830 --> 03:11:57,610
To like other people...

5133
03:11:57,610 --> 03:12:00,430
Who just like... Who live like in Asia...

5134
03:12:00,430 --> 03:12:03,090
And all they know about Digi... Like you know...

5135
03:12:03,090 --> 03:12:05,730
The Digimon opening is like...

5136
03:12:06,070 --> 03:12:06,390
Butterfly?

5137
03:12:06,390 --> 03:12:08,250
I've never heard of... Like I told you guys...

5138
03:12:08,250 --> 03:12:09,850
I've never heard about Butterfly...

5139
03:12:09,850 --> 03:12:11,930
Until like... Recently...

5140
03:12:11,930 --> 03:12:13,390
Like you know... Like I think like...

5141
03:12:13,770 --> 03:12:16,290
Like um...

5142
03:12:16,290 --> 03:12:17,590
Uh... Maybe like...

5143
03:12:17,590 --> 03:12:19,690
Uh... Maybe like within like...

5144
03:12:19,690 --> 03:12:20,250
7 years?

5145
03:12:20,390 --> 03:12:21,890
That's when like I heard...

5146
03:12:21,890 --> 03:12:22,670
About Butterfly.

5147
03:12:22,890 --> 03:12:23,810
But like...

5148
03:12:23,810 --> 03:12:25,450
I grew up with...

5149
03:12:26,070 --> 03:12:28,010

That's... Like I...

5156
03:12:37,900 --> 03:12:40,170
Butterfly is like the Japanese opening...

5157
03:12:40,170 --> 03:12:41,410
For Digimon...

5158
03:12:41,410 --> 03:12:44,330
And like people are like... Oh it's like the most famous...

5159
03:12:44,330 --> 03:12:45,790

Of all time... Like it's one of the...

5161
03:12:48,770 --> 03:12:49,850
That's one of the...

5162
03:12:49,850 --> 03:12:51,550
Most famous...

5163
03:12:52,270 --> 03:12:52,890

Anime openings... And I was like...

5165
03:12:55,990 --> 03:12:56,130
What?

5166
03:12:57,810 --> 03:12:59,430
I think... Oh yes!

5167
03:12:59,610 --> 03:13:01,770
The first time I've ever heard...

5168
03:13:01,770 --> 03:13:04,070
Butterfly... Was when they did the...

5169
03:13:04,070 --> 03:13:05,810
Movie reboot...

5170
03:13:06,070 --> 03:13:07,510
The movie reboot where Tai...

5171
03:13:07,510 --> 03:13:09,690
Were like adults slash teenagers...

5172
03:13:09,690 --> 03:13:11,570
Or some shit... And then so like...

5173
03:13:11,570 --> 03:13:14,170
They had a thing where like the Digimon Tamers...

5174
03:13:14,170 --> 03:13:16,190
Um... The Digimon Tamers...

5175
03:13:16,190 --> 03:13:17,990
The Digimon Tamers were singing...

5176
03:13:17,990 --> 03:13:20,230
The opening of Butterfly...

5177
03:13:20,230 --> 03:13:22,110
And that was the very first...

5178
03:13:22,110 --> 03:13:24,070
Time I heard Butterfly...

5179
03:13:24,610 --> 03:13:26,170

5180
03:13:26,170 --> 03:13:27,030

Like... Hahaha!

5189
03:13:36,210 --> 03:13:38,010
Little did I know...

5190
03:13:38,010 --> 03:13:40,330
It came from the TV show...

5191
03:13:41,350 --> 03:13:41,990

5192
03:13:41,990 --> 03:13:42,690

I can't believe DigiDestined...

5204
03:14:00,430 --> 03:14:01,470

5205
03:14:01,590 --> 03:14:02,070

5206
03:14:02,070 --> 03:14:04,030
DigiDestined to sing a song for...

5207
03:14:04,030 --> 03:14:04,510
This movie!

5208
03:14:04,790 --> 03:14:05,450
Woah!

5209
03:14:06,090 --> 03:14:06,690
Hahaha!

5210
03:14:06,830 --> 03:14:08,030
And that was the first...

5211
03:14:08,030 --> 03:14:09,510
Time I've ever heard...

5212
03:14:09,710 --> 03:14:11,910
Um... That's literally...

5213
03:14:11,910 --> 03:14:14,170
The first time I've ever...

5214
03:14:14,170 --> 03:14:15,470
Heard Butterfly...

5215
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:17,350
Um... Because of the movie...

5216
03:14:17,350 --> 03:14:19,770
Um... Because I grew up with...

5217
03:14:19,770 --> 03:14:21,590
With the Digimon...

5218
03:14:21,590 --> 03:14:22,910
Digital Monsters...

5219
03:14:22,910 --> 03:14:25,790

03:14:27,590 --> 03:14:27,850
Hahaha!

5222
03:14:28,970 --> 03:14:31,930
That shit still slaps though... That shit slaps...

5223
03:14:31,930 --> 03:14:33,130
Man... Hahaha!

5224
03:14:33,130 --> 03:14:33,850
And then...

5225
03:14:34,030 --> 03:14:34,790
We tell them about... Yeah!

5226
03:14:34,910 --> 03:14:35,970
We had our own opening!

5227
03:14:36,290 --> 03:14:37,390
They'll be like... What the fuck?

5228
03:14:37,710 --> 03:14:37,830
Hahaha!

5229
03:14:37,950 --> 03:14:39,250
And I'll be like... What do you...

5230
03:14:39,250 --> 03:14:41,990
What do you mean you had your own English opening?

5231
03:14:42,210 --> 03:14:43,610
Is it as good as Butterfly?

5232
03:14:43,870 --> 03:14:45,290
And then I'll just be like...

5233
03:14:46,550 --> 03:14:47,510
Um... Yeah...

5234
03:14:47,930 --> 03:14:49,250
You can say that...

5235
03:14:49,250 --> 03:14:50,230
It was catchy!

5236
03:14:50,870 --> 03:14:52,030
It was a catchy...

5237
03:14:52,030 --> 03:14:52,430
Opening!

5238
03:14:52,990 --> 03:14:53,470
Like...

5239
03:14:54,630 --> 03:14:56,470
That's... That's something...

5240
03:14:56,470 --> 03:14:57,590
To be fair...

5241
03:14:57,590 --> 03:14:59,810
Like we always made up lyrics...

5242
03:14:59,810 --> 03:15:02,290
Like I miss the time when we made up...

5243
03:15:02,290 --> 03:15:03,650

03:15:04,030 --> 03:15:05,550

You guys know how like... The Sailor Moon opening...

5247
03:15:10,310 --> 03:15:11,810
Is like super iconic...

5248
03:15:11,810 --> 03:15:13,830
The English one... Is like...

5249
03:15:13,830 --> 03:15:15,730
Uh... Fighting... What is it?

5250
03:15:15,870 --> 03:15:18,530
Fighting evil by moonlight...

5251
03:15:18,530 --> 03:15:20,010
Bum ba da da da...

5252
03:15:20,010 --> 03:15:20,970
Bum bum...

5253
03:15:20,970 --> 03:15:23,990
Oh my gosh... What was... I haven't heard the Sailor Moon opening...

5254
03:15:23,990 --> 03:15:24,810
In so long... Hahaha!

5255
03:15:26,510 --> 03:15:28,130
Um... But like...

5256
03:15:28,130 --> 03:15:30,350
The English opening... They made up words...

5257
03:15:30,350 --> 03:15:32,130
They made up words for it...

5258
03:15:32,130 --> 03:15:34,010
Uh... It wasn't even like...

5259
03:15:34,030 --> 03:15:34,730
Hahaha!

5260
03:15:35,270 --> 03:15:38,320
It had nothing to do with the original opening...

5261
03:15:38,570 --> 03:15:39,950
It's the same melody...

5262
03:15:39,950 --> 03:15:41,510
But it's a different...

5263
03:15:41,510 --> 03:15:42,010
Hahaha!

5264
03:15:42,190 --> 03:15:43,310
It's not...

5265
03:15:43,310 --> 03:15:45,830
It had nothing to do with the original...

5266
03:15:45,830 --> 03:15:47,590
Japanese opening...

5267
03:15:47,590 --> 03:15:49,350
It's the same melody...

5268
03:15:49,840 --> 03:15:50,770
Lyrics don't...

5269
03:15:50,770 --> 03:15:53,590
Lyrics had no connection...

5270
03:15:53,590 --> 03:15:55,190
With the original song...

5271
03:15:55,190 --> 03:15:57,450
Which I thought was really funny...

5272
03:15:57,450 --> 03:15:57,870
Hahaha!

5273
03:15:59,650 --> 03:16:00,430

5283
03:16:17,930 --> 03:16:19,970

But yeah... It was...

Um...

5297
03:16:47,110 --> 03:16:50,250
This is a miracle of romance...

5298
03:16:50,250 --> 03:16:52,410
I'm reading the lyrics right now...

5299
03:16:52,410 --> 03:16:53,750

Hahaha!

5303
03:16:58,950 --> 03:16:59,990
It's so...

5304
03:17:00,430 --> 03:17:02,850
It's so funny like rereading this...

5305
03:17:04,410 --> 03:17:04,990
It's so funny like rereading this...

5306
03:17:04,990 --> 03:17:06,350
Yeah and it's like the original...

5307
03:17:06,350 --> 03:17:08,270
Sailor Moon opening and we just made up...

5308
03:17:08,270 --> 03:17:11,210
We just made up English lyrics cause it sounded good...

5309
03:17:12,390 --> 03:17:13,550
Sailor Moon...

5310
03:17:14,790 --> 03:17:16,430
English lyrics opening...

5311
03:17:17,070 --> 03:17:17,650
English lyrics opening...

5312
03:17:18,990 --> 03:17:20,450

03:17:20,450 --> 03:17:21,850
Yeah it's just like...

5314
03:17:21,850 --> 03:17:23,570
Fighting evil by moonlight...

5315
03:17:23,570 --> 03:17:25,390
Winning love by daylight...

5316
03:17:25,390 --> 03:17:27,510
Never running from a real fight...

5317
03:17:27,510 --> 03:17:29,870
She is the one named Sailor Moon...

5318
03:17:29,870 --> 03:17:32,010
And then you fucking read this...

5319
03:17:32,010 --> 03:17:32,410
And it's like...

5320
03:17:32,410 --> 03:17:33,950
It's hard for me to say...

5321
03:17:33,950 --> 03:17:36,210
Although it's easy to say in my dreams...

5322
03:17:36,210 --> 03:17:38,790
My thought circuit is about to break down...

5323
03:17:38,790 --> 03:17:41,490
You know right now I want you with me...

5324
03:17:41,490 --> 03:17:43,950
That's like what it was supposed to be...

5325
03:17:43,950 --> 03:17:45,270
Like that's...

5326
03:17:45,270 --> 03:17:45,790
Hahaha!

5327
03:17:47,250 --> 03:17:47,570
Hahaha!

5328
03:17:47,850 --> 03:17:51,610
That's the original lyrics...

5329
03:17:54,230 --> 03:17:54,870
Hahaha!

5330
03:17:55,670 --> 03:17:56,950
And yeah...

5331
03:17:57,510 --> 03:17:58,950
I just thought it was fucking hilarious...

5332
03:18:03,060 --> 03:18:05,940
That's not an intro...

5333
03:18:05,940 --> 03:18:06,740
Hahaha!

5334
03:18:07,920 --> 03:18:08,440
Hahaha!

5335
