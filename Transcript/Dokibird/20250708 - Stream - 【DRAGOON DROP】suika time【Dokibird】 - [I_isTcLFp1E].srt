1
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,440
Hello, everybody.

2
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:51,840
Hello, hello.

3
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:54,260
I'm sorry for being a little late today.

4
00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:00,760
My manager was like, we have to talk about the sponsors and business stuff.

5
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,800
And then, like, because, like, basically, I was off the grid for two days.

6
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,120
So, I was off the grid for two days.

7
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,660
And so, no, I'm not blaming my manager.

8
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,920
It was partially my fault.

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:28,280
So, I did not exist on the internet for the last two days because I was basically outside, like, doing stuff.

10
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,140
Yeah, so, because I was off the grid, there was a lot of things I needed to catch up on.

11
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:44,240
And, like, you know, because I was about to start stream, my manager was like, this is the only time I can actually talk to you because you're actually online.

12
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,960
So, there's going to be, like, a couple of sponsors lined up for the next... well, not this month.

13
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,880
I think it'll be, like, next month or some shit.

14
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:03,660
And I said yes to a bunch of stuff because, like, daddy needs money to pay her debt collectors.

15
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,920
I'm not in debt.

16
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,100
I'm not in debt.

17
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,480
I didn't borrow money from the mafia.

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,800
I just... I need to... I need to fill up my bank account after what happened from the concert.

19
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,060
Hey, after the concert, my bank account is looking a little less empty.

20
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,040
So, I got to fill it up right now.

21
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,500
So, I was saying yes to a bunch of stuff.

22
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,880
I was like, oh, yeah, I'll do that.

23
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,600
And I'll do that.

24
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,880
And I'll do that, too.

25
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,880
So, yeah, so...

26
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,080
August might be... look, okay.

27
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,560
I love, like, the comparison because my manager is like, I don't want to make you look like a race car.

28
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,600
So, like, please choose the ones you really want to do.

29
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,820
Because we're not going to make you into a fucking race car.

30
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:06,280
Where, you know, like, those, like, Formula One race cars where it's all just sponsors plastered all over the car itself?

31
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,980
No, I can't...

32
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,220
Ka-chow!

33
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,620
So, I'm trying to make sure I don't end up like that.

34
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,100
Because, like, I say yes very easily to things.

35
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,080
And sometimes I undercharge myself because I was like, oh, I really want to do this sponsor.

36
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,860
Like, fuck it.

37
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,680
They want to charge...

38
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Okay, there was one where I was like, I'll do it for X amount of money.

39
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,880
That's fine.

40
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,860
Like, they're like, okay.

41
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,820
Um, my manager was like, oh, so this sponsor wants you to do, um...

42
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,260
He paid this amount.

43
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,340
Are you okay with that?

44
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
And I was like, yeah, I'm fine with that.

45
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,580
And then he was like, okay, I'll ask for 1k more.

46
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,600
Papa Smear, thank you for the super chat.

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,300
Thank you, thank you.

48
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,880
How much should I put my logo on?

49
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,580
You're just checking your rates.

50
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,660
Thank you for the super chat.

51
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,920
Thank you, thank you.

52
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
Um, um, but yeah.

53
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,180
Anyway, I have a lot of dad updates today.

54
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,040
But I'm gonna, um, I'm gonna stagger these stories.

55
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,300
Because a lot of stuff happened for dad.

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,020
Um, because I was outside, like, touching grass.

57
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,060
I actually took him to a park yesterday, too.

58
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,700
Um, there was, like, those, like, horse car- Like, those, like, horse rides and stuff.

59
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:28,540
Where, like, you sit on, like, back of the horse- Like, not on the horse, but, like, you know, like, this, like, little, um, carriage thing.

60
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,260
And then, like, I sat there in the back with dad.

61
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,600
And, like, he was just super chill like that.

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,040
He was just super chill.

63
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,040
He's like, ah, yes.

64
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,660
Pull me bigger.

65
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,180
You bigger dogs.

66
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,460
Being pulled by these big-ass dogs.

67
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,120
Yes.

68
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,320
Pull me.

69
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,820
I am rich.

70
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,980
And you are just a peasant in my eyes.

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,800
Anyway, he's just a chill guy.

72
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,600
Okay, by the way, um, he- Okay, he's such a little shit.

73
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,620
Okay, so, the last two days, you know, it's because I'm, like, off the grid.

74
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,500
And I wasn't existing online.

75
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,440
Um, he- and was just, like, mostly relaxing.

76
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,360
He let me sleep.

77
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,960
He actually let me sleep and didn't demand me to feed him early.

78
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:17,060
Or, like, uh, or, uh, like, for walkies or anything.

79
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,880
So, like, I was able to wake up at times I want to wake up.

80
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,860
So, you know, usually he would demand me, uh, to feed him at, like, 5 a.m.

81
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,600
or 6 a.m.

82
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,740
But, for once in my life, he actually, like, um, didn't do that.

83
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,840
Like, the last two days.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,720
The last two days.

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
So generous of him, I know.

86
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,120
Uh, and I was like, oh, that's so nice.

87
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,180
During my, like, you know, break days, too.

88
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,060
Like, my rest days.

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,360
He's not gonna, like, fuck me over.

90
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,180
And then, you know, today, we're- Um, I actually officially go back to work.

91
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,940
Uh, guess who decided to wake me up at 5 20 a.m.

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,960
today in the morning?

93
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,200
He's like, he's like, oh, you're going back to work?

94
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,600
Guess I have to go back to work, too.

95
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,240
So, he's like, he's here.

96
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,940
He's just trying to make sure I get there on time, you know?

97
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,580
Even though I work at home.

98
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,980
Um, he's like, you know what?

99
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,980
Break time's over.

100
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,580
I was like, please.

101
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,120
Please, it's 5 20 a.m.

102
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,420
And I was like, I'm gonna sleep.

103
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,400
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

104
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,420
Maybe he'll get tired.

105
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:37,180
And then he wakes me up again at fucking 6 30 in the morning.

106
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:40,280
He's like, the snooze button only lasts for an hour.

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,220
And he's like, oh, it's time!

108
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,680
What?

109
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,120
I want food!

110
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,260
Oh, that's so considerate of him.

111
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,100
I know, I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

112
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,180
How did you know?

113
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,600
How did you know I'm going back to work today?

114
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,560
How?

115
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:56,660
Why?

116
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,020
He gave me a false sense of security.

117
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,040
I was like, oh my god, I fixed him.

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,320
I legitimately was like, oh my god, is this it?

119
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,420
Did I finally fix him?

120
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,800
Is he not gonna wake me up at god-awful hours for food?

121
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,200
It was all a bait.

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,660
He baited me so hard.

123
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:27,080
Anyway, okay, so, um, when I took him to a park, I actually took him to a real park, not just a dog park, but an actual park park.

124
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,140
Not only did we do, like, those, like, horse carriage rides, um, but there was, like, a giant-ass fucking field.

125
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,300
And so, you know, obviously, I want him, I want to play fetch with him.

126
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,740
And, um, and then, it was very sunny outside.

127
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,220
It was actually, like, incredibly sunny, too.

128
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,400
And, um, and, like, I chucked the ball really fucking far.

129
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,440
Like, you know, because it was a large-ass field.

130
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,560
I was like, go get it, Dad!

131
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,280
Look at that!

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,340
Now you can run to your heart's content.

133
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:05,780
He ran to the ball, and then he gave up halfway, and then pivoted to the shade.

134
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:13,740
And I was just like, are you fucking kidding me?

135
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,080
I literally was like, yeah!

136
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:22,680
And then halfway there, he, like, he, like, this sharp turn to the left, and then went to the shade.

137
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,160
I was like, are you fucking kidding me?

138
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,500
You love playing fetch!

139
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:38,540
And the one time, the one time we actually have the field of your dreams, and you were like, no!

140
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,420
Running's too hard!

141
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,840
Like, why did you throw that fire?

142
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay, don't worry.

143
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,500
I'll give you guys a diagram.

144
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,820
I'll draw you guys a little picture of, like, this little shit.

145
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,780
And he's like...

146
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:14,080
And then there, and it was like, the shade was just a bunch of benches, and he, he sat, and then he just laid down there, and, and, like, underneath the bench.

147
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,140
And I'm like, are you serious?

148
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,580
Okay, don't worry.

149
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,180
I got, I got a picture.

150
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,320
Uh, I don't know how hot it was pretty.

151
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,320
It was just really sunny.

152
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,980
I don't even know how hot it was.

153
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,180
Um, but it was just incredibly sunny.

154
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,620
Okay, so this was the diagram.

155
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,860
I'll draw you.

156
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,600
Alright, here it is.

157
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,960
This is what, this is what he was doing.

158
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,580
It was like, nope!

159
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,040
Like, he can't, he ran there.

160
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,000
He did go there.

161
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,220
He was going that direction, and then he's just like, boop.

162
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,140
Um, Alex, thank you for the super chat.

163
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,060
Thank you, thank you.

164
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,560
I love the short time program channel.

165
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,040
Since I can't always catch the stream, the data updates are always so funny.

166
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,680
Thank you for the super chat.

167
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,900
Thank you, thank you.

168
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,080
Hard left.

169
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:11,180
He's like, oh, I could get the ball, or I could go, I could go over to the left side with a shade.

170
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,480
I was like, that's enough exercise for the day now.

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,940
I was like, what exercise?

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,780
You were just sitting, you were just lying down at the horse carriage.

173
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,260
What do you mean, exercise?

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,320
You would be a lazy fucking dog being pulled by bigger animals.

175
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,520
Oh, he's so spoiled now.

176
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,900
He's so fucking spoiled.

177
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,900
He touched the grass.

178
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Yes, that is enough exercise.

179
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,060
Also, another dad update.

180
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:58,420
When I was at my usual dog park, I think last night, he would not leave this couple alone.

181
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,000
And I was so confused because I was like, please poop.

182
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
That's all I want from you.

183
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,420
I was like, please, dad, please poop.

184
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,680
And then all he did was just like hover around this couple.

185
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,700
And then I gave up, by the way.

186
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,040
Like, I just ended up going home because I was like, I'm not going to stay here for an hour waiting for you to poop.

187
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,800
And then the couple was like, oh, I'm sorry.

188
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,860
We gave him treats.

189
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,220
Like, we were the ones that gave him treats last month.

190
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,760
And he thinks we still have them.

191
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,780
And I was like, you little shit.

192
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:41,160
Like, it has been a month since you've seen this couple.

193
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,340
And I can't believe he remembers.

194
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,020
He, he, I was like, he, he never forgets.

195
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:53,580
He, he, he never forgets your face if you give him a treat.

196
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,280
Because I don't even remember.

197
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,520
I was so confused.

198
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,700
And he's like, they're like, yeah, yeah.

199
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,880
We gave him treats last month.

200
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,100
Remember?

201
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,540
Like, when we, when we saw you last time.

202
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,340
I was like, I do not remember.

203
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,360
I was like, you are not that, I'm sorry.

204
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,260
This shows me.

205
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,920
I was like, you are not that important in my life to remember this.

206
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,220
But they were very important in dad's life.

207
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,800
Anyway, so.

208
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,000
That's why he was like, covering them.

209
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,180
He was like, oh my God.

210
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,120
It's them.

211
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,100
It's been a month.

212
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:27,860
Oh my God.

213
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,780
You've returned the messiahs.

214
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,960
The treat givers.

215
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,160
I'll always be grateful for your generosity.

216
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,780
They made, they made an impact in his life right there.

217
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,900
Jen, thank you for the super chat.

218
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,320
Thank you.

219
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,120
Thank you.

220
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,080
Freedom.

221
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,800
EP time.

222
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,380
Oh, Rodrigo.

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,380
Thank you for the super chat.

224
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:53,740
Thank you.

225
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,340
Thank you.

226
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,740
You gave dad treats.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,560
Dad will remember that.

228
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,620
Thank you for the super chat.

229
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,040
Thank you.

230
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:00,920
Thank you.

231
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,120
They are like, not even top 10.

232
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,960
They're like, top, top three people in his life, life right now.

233
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:07,640
All right.

234
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
Anyway, game time.

235
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,480
Alright, today we're gonna be playing Dragoon Drop.

236
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:19,440
For those who are wondering what game this is, basically, a bunch of dragoons got together and made me a game for my birthday.

237
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,280
And it's basically like, if you ever play the Suica game, the watermelon game, it's basically like that.

238
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:29,460
But instead of like fruits and watermelon, it's me and dragoons.

239
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,040
So yeah, that's basically what, I mean, that's basically self-explanatory.

240
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,160
That's what this game is about.

241
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,420
So I'm super excited to try this game out.

242
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:45,780
I had an insane, unhealthy addiction to the Suica game, but like, not playing it.

243
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,920
I had an unhealthy obsession watching Suica game for some reason.

244
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,620
I was like living vicariously off of other people playing the game.

245
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,940
Because it was just so addicting to watch for some reason.

246
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:05,120
But I didn't play that much myself because I just liked watching people play it more.

247
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,380
But I like, I never really got, I don't, I don't even remember if I got, I don't know, did I ever got watermelon?

248
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,760
I don't even remember if I got Suica.

249
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,180
I think I did.

250
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,160
I was just, I think I did.

251
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,400
But I never got double watermelon.

252
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:24,120
But yeah, no, it's, it's been so long.

253
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,280
But yes, this is basically the game.

254
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,200
You can try out the game yourself.

255
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,020
I put the download link in the description.

256
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,120
And there's apparently a live leaderboard too.

257
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:40,520
So you can compete with other dragoons in the water, sorry, not the water, in Dragoon Drop.

258
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,020
But yes, you can also compete as well against your own fellow dragoons to see who is the best dragoon dropper.

259
00:15:51,780 --> 00:16:02,880
Other things I want to talk about, oh yes, for the Doki merch stuff, for those who don't know, I have released some birthday merch and also a lot of other merch launches on the website.

260
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,660
I asked them about like whether or not there's any limited pre-orders yet.

261
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,060
And they said at this current moment, there isn't.

262
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,280
But I will update you if they do plan on adding like, um, like anything that's like limited on the store.

263
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,920
But I'll let you guys know.

264
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,000
For now, I have not heard anything yet.

265
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,900
Devin, thank you, Magenta Super!

266
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,420
Thank you, thank you!

267
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,060
Happy B-Day, thank you!

268
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,900
Thank you, everyone!

269
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,880
Thank you, everyone, for celebrating my birthday with me.

270
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,520
On, uh, was it Saturday or Friday?

271
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,640
Wait, no, was it?

272
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,240
No, it was not Saturday.

273
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:32,800
It was Friday.

274
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,200
Thank you, everyone, for celebrating my birthday with me on Friday!

275
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,500
Um, it was such a great day.

276
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,040
I was honestly, you guys could tell I sort of like hibernated after that.

277
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,400
Because I didn't tweet anything.

278
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:48,480
I didn't tweet anything at all about my birthday stuff.

279
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,780
I didn't tweet anything after all the stuff was done.

280
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,800
I just disappeared.

281
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,120
Other than my mandatory sponsors.

282
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,300
By the way, speaking of sponsors, tonight I will be doing another two-hour...

283
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,640
The last two-hour sponsor of Mechabrick tonight on Twitch.

284
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,220
So you guys can check me out there.

285
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,180
Later on after Dragoon Drop.

286
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:14,660
So yeah.

287
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,600
And so it will be another two hours.

288
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm going to do more custom lobbies too.

289
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,420
So you guys want to have more chance to play with me in Mechabrick.

290
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,200
Make sure to download the game.

291
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,600
So we can do some more custom lobbies later.

292
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,760
Alright, anyway, let's actually run Dragoon Drop.

293
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
Alright, Main Wave Unity.

294
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,630
Oh, I forgot.

295
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,870
You guys can't hear it.

296
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,890
You guys are supposed to be like, what is...

297
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:47,610
Why is she...

298
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,310
Why is she saying that?

299
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:51,290
I forgot this is a Chrome tab.

300
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,950
Not a fucking game tab.

301
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:54,930
I was like...

302
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,050
I sound like a fucking schizo right now.

303
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,850
Listening to the voices in my head.

304
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,750
Okay.

305
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,470
Let's see.

306
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,370
Let me make sure I have everything.

307
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,530
I just want to fix the...

308
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,790
I'm just trying to fix this real.

309
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,430
Fix the...

310
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,270
There we go.

311
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,170
Okay.

312
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,430
That should be good.

313
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,050
Alright.

314
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,510
Alright, here we go.

315
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,550
Let me know if the music is loud enough or...

316
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:28,930
Alright.

317
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,650
So...

318
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,790
We're trying to make a Suica.

319
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,110
Which is...

320
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,810
Uh...

321
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,370
Which is me.

322
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,050
I am...

323
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,170
I am the Dragoon.

324
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,110
I am the peak Dragoon life form.

325
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:39,530
Uh...

326
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,830
To be fair, I don't think in this game.

327
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,010
But you have to think.

328
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,070
Because you're supposed to...

329
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:44,670
Oh yeah, by the way.

330
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,310
Here's the global leaderboard.

331
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,190
So...

332
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:47,770
Um...

333
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,890
Guys, you think I can make it?

334
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:50,430
I know.

335
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:51,070
I'm like...

336
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,370
Whoa!

337
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,130
When...

338
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,110
Why did...

339
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,010
Why did mom let you have two leaderboard slots?

340
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,230
Uh...

341
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,750
The final evolution of Dragoons is basically me.

342
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,670
Um...

343
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,170
But I legitimately...

344
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:08,290
Okay.

345
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,470
I'll let you guys know this right now.

346
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:13,270
I don't think when I play this game, these types of games, I legitimately just...

347
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:16,250
I just drop things and then hope for the best.

348
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,630
So like, if...

349
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,150
If I get lucky, I get lucky.

350
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:19,990
I...

351
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,390
I have...

352
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,030
I don't do any strategies for this.

353
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:25,970
I know like...

354
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,170
That's not how you're supposed to play the game.

355
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,510
But like...

356
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,910
My...

357
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:35,290
My brain cannot fit more things right now.

358
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,150
There's very...

359
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,570
Very limited...

360
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,650
I'm playing for the vibes.

361
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,170
Exactly.

362
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,310
There's very limited hard drive space.

363
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,210
Um...

364
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,450
Not SSD by the way.

365
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,090
I don't have...

366
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:48,170
I don't have...

367
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,590
Oh, hey, look!

368
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,190
It's Kroki!

369
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:51,290
Um...

370
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,870
My brain cannot afford an SSD.

371
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,350
So like...

372
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,270
It's just a hard drive.

373
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,010
That's even...

374
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,950
I know it's even worse.

375
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,150
Uh...

376
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:00,590
HD hard drive brain.

377
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,230
Drop good.

378
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,310
Yeah, as long as I drop good, I win.

379
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,530
I did do a test run of this like...

380
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,010
Last night.

381
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,770
And I think I got to...

382
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,610
I got to like...

383
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:21,710
Um...

384
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,030
I think like...

385
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:23,610
800.

386
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,590
And then like...

387
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,310
I didn't lose.

388
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,950
I just got bored and just...

389
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,650
Started playing things everywhere.

390
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:29,690
And...

391
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,310
And...

392
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,010
Doki brain is a floppy drive.

393
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,490
Dango!

394
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,650
Thank you for the super chat!

395
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:34,090
Thank you!

396
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:34,950
Thank you!

397
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,650
Ha ha ha ha!

398
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,630
Ha ha ha!

399
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:37,010
Ha ha ha!

400
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,290
No!

401
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,410
And literally I was like...

402
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:38,870
Ah, 800.

403
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,290
That's good enough.

404
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,290
And I just started...

405
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,490
Like left clicking.

406
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,430
Ha ha ha ha!

407
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:42,990
In the center.

408
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,630
Ah ha ha ha!

409
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,130
Ha ha ha ha!

410
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,370
I was like...

411
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,030
I was like...

412
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,490
Okay, that's enough testing now.

413
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,790
Yeah!

414
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,090
Uh...

415
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,130
I guess I'll put him here.

416
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:55,690
And then...

417
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,890
I'll put this guy here.

418
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:01,850
Ba dum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum...

419
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,350
Ba dum...

420
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,170
Ba dum...

421
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,110
Ba dum...

422
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,670
Okay, we'll make another tomato.

423
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,890
Okay, I fucked it up already.

424
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:08,570
But that's okay.

425
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,050
Okay, I can fix this.

426
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,490
I can fix her.

427
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:20,170
Okay, um... Some things in life is just not fixable, and you just gotta accept it.

428
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,170
Oh, how did I fuck it up already?

429
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,610
Oh, no, I didn't.

430
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,950
Look at that!

431
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,330
Baited.

432
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,810
I knew I didn't fuck up.

433
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,070
Oh, who said it was over?

434
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,830
You guys were non-believers.

435
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,170
I knew it wasn't over.

436
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,730
It was all planned.

437
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,250
It's the reaction time.

438
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:51,690
Oh, wait.

439
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:52,710
Oh, fuck.

440
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:54,270
Maybe I can, like, push him over?

441
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,610
Maybe?

442
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,650
Oh, why did I do that?

443
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,070
Oh, it's a rat.

444
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:01,890
What's the rat?

445
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,590
What does the rat do?

446
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,010
What the fuck does the rat do?

447
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,690
What does it do?

448
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,390
Is it just there?

449
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,770
Is it just, like, a cock blocker?

450
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,310
What was his purpose?

451
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,950
Oh, they're never gonna meet.

452
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,570
That's so sad.

453
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:23,790
They're never... What the rat doing?

454
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,870
Is it just, like, there to fuck with me?

455
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,310
It's so sad.

456
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,810
These two whores are never gonna meet up.

457
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:35,590
There's, like, Jesus in between them.

458
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:39,550
You know, like, when you're slow dancing in, like, middle school and up?

459
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,250
They'll be like, make sure you have Jesus in front of... Like, leave enough room for Jesus.

460
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,670
That's what I'm doing right now.

461
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,970
These sluts will never touch.

462
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,690
If you're gonna show your butthead.

463
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:55,930
Jesus.

464
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,730
God, leave room for Jesus.

465
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,290
Gee, thank you for the super chat.

466
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,710
Thank you.

467
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,450
Thank you.

468
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,230
I associated crows with you so much.

469
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:07,650
Last week, another VTuber was playing just crow things.

470
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,530
And I thought you were collabing.

471
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,950
Thank you for the super chat.

472
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,410
Thank you.

473
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,190
Thank you.

474
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,070
Leave room if you wanna be forgiven.

475
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:24,290
I still can't believe Pom Pomper in one fucking whore.

476
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,470
That's the only reason why he won.

477
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,530
And you guys know it.

478
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,510
He showed his asshole.

479
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,450
To so many people.

480
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,950
Sinamaru deserves that win.

481
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,650
He was robbed!

482
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,470
I'm not coping.

483
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,010
I am not coping.

484
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:52,130
Like, if he didn't show his booty hole...

485
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:53,830
Sinamaru would have won.

486
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,810
Sinamaru is cultured.

487
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,070
He don't need to show his booty hole...

488
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,810
...to win five times in a row.

489
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,290
Just respect the asshole.

490
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:06,970
Okay, nice.

491
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:09,510
He's...

492
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,750
Yeah!

493
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,950
He's not!

494
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,950
P.R.S.

495
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,330
No!

496
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,750
Yes, he does.

497
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:19,290
Sinamaru needs to win another year in a row.

498
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,930
That's why he's my kamioshi.

499
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:25,890
I actually...

500
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,170
Before Pom Pomperin became, like, super fucking popular...

501
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,130
Um...

502
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,670
I actually own a Pom Pomperin onesie.

503
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,290
That shows his booty hole.

504
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,050
Only Rose sells as...

505
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,550
As usual.

506
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,430
Luca, thank you for the super chat.

507
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:43,810
Thank you.

508
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:44,570
Thank you.

509
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,350
He showed whole...

510
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,310
We respond.

511
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,600
What surprised me the most was...

512
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,320
Where the fuck did Pochaco even come from?

513
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,620
When did he be...

514
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,120
When did he became popular?

515
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,500
Like...

516
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,860
Who allowed him...

517
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,940
To be top three?

518
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,720
Yeah, he was a dark horse.

519
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,160
He worked hard.

520
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,700
I swear, I've never seen anything with Pochaco before.

521
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,520
I was like...

522
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,840
How the fuck did he even came third place?

523
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,800
I see more shit with...

524
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,360
I don't even...

525
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:32,800
Okay, okay.

526
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,200
So, I don't know if you guys know this.

527
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,920
But, like...

528
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,260
Uh...

529
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,480
No, fuck my Melody.

530
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,720
She has something to hide.

531
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,500
I hate my Melody.

532
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,380
Uh...

533
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,020
But, like...

534
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:48,560
I swear to God.

535
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay, so, like...

536
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,320
For those who don't know, like...

537
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,820
Uh...

538
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,120
Sanrio lore...

539
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,660
Um...

540
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,960
Each character...

541
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,120
Has, like...

542
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,580
Not...

543
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,640
Not each of them, but...

544
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,160
Actually, no.

545
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,940
Majority of the characters...

546
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,160
Have, uh...

547
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,820
Their own YouTube channel...

548
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,400
And, like, social media platform.

549
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:05,780
And...

550
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,100
Take it back!

551
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,720
No!

552
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,480
I won't!

553
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,380
I know she's hiding something!

554
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,620
Ha ha ha ha!

555
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,380
Yeah, and they actually do song covers and stuff, too.

556
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,480
So...

557
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,540
Um...

558
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,120
So, like...

559
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,460
A lot of their YouTube channels...

560
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,180
You can find, like...

561
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:23,460
You know, like...

562
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,940
Hello Kitty will have, like...

563
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,660
Her own...

564
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,140
Oh my God!

565
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,780
Oh my God!

566
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,000
They're gonna touch...

567
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,160
Leave room for Jesus!

568
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,760
Ha ha ha!

569
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:30,800
Ha ha ha!

570
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,880
Ha ha ha!

571
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,040
But...

572
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,780
Um...

573
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,180
They would have, like...

574
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,400
Uh...

575
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,500
Song covers...

576
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:37,840
That...

577
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,620
Oh my God!

578
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,200
Suica!

579
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,760
Ha ha ha ha!

580
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,600
Ha ha ha ha!

581
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,400
Ha ha ha ha!

582
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,980
Planned!

583
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,600
I did not...

584
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,180
Definitely planned!

585
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,600
Ha ha ha!

586
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:51,680
Ha ha ha!

587
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,120
In...

588
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,480
Ha ha ha!

589
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,120
Jokey!

590
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:53,820
Ha ha ha!

591
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,660
Ha ha ha!

592
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,490
Anyway...

593
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,520
Um...

594
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,360
In...

595
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,620
Um...

596
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,680
In...

597
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,500
Uh...

598
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,440
For San Nuyo...

599
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:02,960
So, like...

600
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,820
Each character will have the...

601
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,860
Their own, like...

602
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,520
Um...

603
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,340
Music videos and stuff for, like...

604
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,020
They will do cover songs and everything.

605
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,740
And also produce original songs and stuff, too.

606
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,740
And I'm like...

607
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,100
Where the...

608
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,120
If you look at all their channels...

609
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,940
I swear to God...

610
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,180
Like...

611
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,860
I have never seen any content...

612
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,040
Like...

613
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm pretty sure he does upload content...

614
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,000
But I...

615
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,800
Personally...

616
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,320
Have never seen any of Pochaco's content...

617
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,420
Going viral!

618
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,140
Like...

619
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:30,640
Karomi!

620
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,400
Or...

621
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,120
Sinamaru!

622
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,340
Or even...

623
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:33,900
Pom Pom...

624
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,820
I would even give it to that...

625
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,220
That Pom Pom Paren...

626
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,520
Had some viral cover songs...

627
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,920
And original songs...

628
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,280
But I swear to God...

629
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,900
I have not heard of any original song...

630
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,940
From goddamn fucking Pochaco!

631
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,580
Like...

632
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,300
Karomi...

633
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,920
Karomi got fourth...

634
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,120
But she has...

635
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,640
Greedy, greedy...

636
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,920
Where is Pochaco?

637
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah, she...

638
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,680
Pochaco's an industry plan...

639
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,720
I swear to God...

640
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha...

641
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,640
What's that voice?

642
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,920
That's the voice of justice...

643
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,320
Ha ha ha ha ha...

644
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,820
It's not all about the song...

645
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,640
What is it?

646
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,720
What is Pochaco's charm point?

647
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,080
He even wears clothes...

648
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,860
Ha ha ha...

649
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,760
He's ashamed of his own body...

650
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,900
Ha ha ha ha...

651
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,580
Ha ha ha ha...

652
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,140
It's just third place...

653
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,420
Yeah!

654
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,660
And he stole third place...

655
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,500
From Karomi!

656
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,440
You're the dog baby...

657
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,440
As in the industry...

658
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:35,320
Yeah!

659
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,060
And it took him how many years...

660
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,720
To even get third place...

661
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:39,900
Uh...

662
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,140
You...

663
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,440
Wait...

664
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,440
Ha ha ha ha...

665
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,320
Stay mad...

666
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:46,540
Yeah!

667
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,460
You and like...

668
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,900
The two other Pochaco fans...

669
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,380
Um...

670
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:50,960
Recount!

671
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,560
I demand a recount!

672
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,880
I bet you...

673
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,960
I bet you those...

674
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,920
But votes were bought in too...

675
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,240
I...

676
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,900
The Pochaco votes are bought in...

677
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,380
Send out Karomi fans...

678
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,080
But never...

679
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,900
We are too respectful...

680
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,140
They done my boy Pochaco bad...

681
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,720
Ha ha ha ha...

682
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,220
True!

683
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,040
Ha ha ha...

684
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,100
Haters will say it was fake...

685
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,020
I demand a recount!

686
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,600
Ha ha ha...

687
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,200
For my boy Karomi...

688
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,700
Okay, Batsumaru does not deserve more...

689
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,550
Ha ha ha...

690
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,460
Ha ha ha...

691
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,240
Batsumaru should stay losing...

692
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,360
Not gonna lie...

693
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,760
Ha ha ha...

694
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,100
Ha ha ha...

695
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,320
Uh...

696
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,860
Um...

697
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,540
Okay, I think I'm gonna lose this...

698
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,180
Cause I have no idea what I'm doing right now...

699
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,360
Ha ha ha...

700
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,060
Ba da da da...

701
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,980
But he used to be popular...

702
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,740
In what world?

703
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Oh my god...

704
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,940
I think it's over, guys...

705
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,900
You know what?

706
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,140
For a first attempt...

707
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,680
That's pretty...

708
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,900
That's pretty good for a first attempt...

709
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,520
Not gonna lie...

710
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,680
Ba da da...

711
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,600
Ba da da...

712
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,560
Ba da...

713
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,100
Ba da...

714
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,920
Ba da...

715
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,020
But I didn't think I'd get this far...

716
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,780
To lay...

717
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,680
Good job...

718
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,560
Oh my god...

719
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,780
You stupid rat...

720
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,060
Good job, Doki...

721
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,740
Um...

722
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,580
Surfing Burb...

723
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,620
Thank you for the super chat...

724
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,780
Thank you, thank you...

725
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,160
Kroki came in today...

726
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,540
She's so soft and level...

727
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,220
And fits with my other fellow Burbs...

728
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,680
Thank you again, Doki...

729
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,960
Thank you for the super chat...

730
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:32,780
Uh...

731
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:33,180
Burb...

732
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,220
Thank you, thank you...

733
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,200
Uh...

734
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:35,680
Michi...

735
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,720
Thank you for the super chat...

736
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,520
Thank you, thank you...

737
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,180
Oh, wait, what?

738
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,260
How did I die?

739
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,540
Okay, you know what?

740
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,480
That's fine...

741
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,300
I'll upload my score...

742
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,380
I don't know what it does when I press Upload Score.

743
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,460
So, Upload Score.

744
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,120
Real Doki.

745
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,020
Alright.

746
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,560
Where am I?

747
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,820
Where do I see my leader?

748
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,880
I wanna know.

749
00:30:59,020 --> 00:30:59,340
Where am I?

750
00:30:59,420 --> 00:30:59,620
Okay.

751
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,540
That's pretty good for it.

752
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,300
2,460?

753
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,200
I think that's pretty good.

754
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,140
Oh my gosh, I wanna tell you guys a really cute story.

755
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:20,200
During my meet and greet at Anime Expo...

756
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,620
By the way, I did a meet and greet at my booth.

757
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Um, and... Oh my gosh, so...

758
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,840
Um...

759
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,280
Apparently...

760
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,120
Uh...

761
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,840
There was a...

762
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,220
There was a little girl.

763
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,080
But she...

764
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:40,040
We were just about to end the meet and greet.

765
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,440
And...

766
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,820
My staff member that was running the meet and greet was like, Oh, stop!

767
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,380
Um...

768
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,420
Wait, wait, wait, stay, stay, stay!

769
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,500
We have one more.

770
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,780
Um, like...

771
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,720
Cause, like, she, like...

772
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,540
Basically, this little girl, like, literally ran over because she was late.

773
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:55,980
And...

774
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,300
Um...

775
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,360
And she, like, ran over to, like, make it in time for my meet and greet.

776
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,220
Just literally...

777
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,000
I was about to go.

778
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,080
I was like, alright guys, bye!

779
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,900
And then a staff member stopped me and was like, Wait, wait, wait, we have one more!

780
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:07,720
And...

781
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,880
She was like...

782
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,160
Quiet!

783
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,420
She had, like, tears in her eyes cause she thought she was gonna miss it.

784
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,500
And...

785
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,020
Um...

786
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:17,520
And she was, like, super happy and was like, Oh my god, I can't believe it.

787
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,020
I made it.

788
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,100
And...

789
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,000
Um...

790
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,800
My staff member told me after the meet and greet was over, Um...

791
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,060
She was telling me that...

792
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,680
Um...

793
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,960
That girl stayed around the booth for one hour.

794
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,320
Um...

795
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,880
Trying to raise money and asking her friends and stuff.

796
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,880
And, like, family members for, like...

797
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,300
Like...

798
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,660
To pool together...

799
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,320
Five dollars to buy a sticker to enter the lottery.

800
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,580
Uh...

801
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,620
For the meet and greet.

802
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,000
And I was like, Oh my god!

803
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,140
That is...

804
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,020
Like...

805
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,580
So sweet.

806
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,580
I was like...

807
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,080
Like...

808
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,560
That...

809
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,440
That she spent, like, an entire hour.

810
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,100
So she can, like, just get one sticker.

811
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,640
Because she really wanted to meet me.

812
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:04,900
And...

813
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,400
Um...

814
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,980
And I was like...

815
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,820
It was really sweet that my staff member, like...

816
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,020
Um...

817
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,260
You know...

818
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,820
Uh...

819
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,280
Let her have a chance to, like, meet me and stuff.

820
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,020
Like, added her into the...

821
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:16,520
Uh...

822
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
No, she was apparently actually a little girl.

823
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,200
Um...

824
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:20,780
Um...

825
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,160
I could tell that she was, like...

826
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,980
Really young and stuff.

827
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,660
And it was like...

828
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,400
It was so cute.

829
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,040
I was like...

830
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,500
Oh my god.

831
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,240
So sweet.

832
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,620
Like...

833
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,100
And she's like...

834
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:27,480
Oh my god.

835
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,800
I really love your content.

836
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,400
And you make me laugh and everything.

837
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:30,940
I was like...

838
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,720
Oh, thank you.

839
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,740
Don't cry.

840
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,640
So I was like...

841
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,880
Her Oshii's a demon.

842
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:38,640
What the fuck?

843
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,180
She's not so sweet.

844
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,140
If she's your...

845
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,320
If you're her Oshii.

846
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,560
True.

847
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,520
A sweet girl.

848
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,200
But yet, this is her Oshii.

849
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,200
Uh...

850
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,640
This kid...

851
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,320
Um...

852
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,380
The kid loves...

853
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,520
Roblox and bounty hunter.

854
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,420
Thank you for the super chat.

855
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:02,940
Thank you.

856
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,660
Thank you.

857
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,420
Why did you make her pay?

858
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:05,760
Huh?

859
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,880
What do you mean me?

860
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,540
I wasn't even...

861
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,440
I wasn't even at my boof right...

862
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,720
Am I even running my own boof, guys?

863
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,760
I was...

864
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,200
She never had a chance.

865
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,940
I hope she never played Roblox again.

866
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:23,540
Oh yeah.

867
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,580
When we're cyberbullying children.

868
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,480
Be like...

869
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:26,680
Leave.

870
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,340
Leave.

871
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,140
Guys.

872
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,980
I did not do what Chibi Dookie did.

873
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,020
When she was like...

874
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,540
I'm gonna shoot you.

875
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,700
I was like...

876
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,300
What the fuck?

877
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,440
I didn't...

878
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,140
I just said...

879
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:40,460
Leave.

880
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,640
Get out.

881
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,580
That's all I said.

882
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,280
I...

883
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,020
Ha ha ha ha.

884
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

885
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:49,500
Ha ha ha ha.

886
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,020
Give her money back.

887
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,560
That poor girl.

888
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,260
Ha ha ha ha ha.

889
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:54,840
Bro.

890
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,280
Uh hum.

891
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,640
Um...

892
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:57,900
But yeah.

893
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,120
No.

894
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,040
I thought that was...

895
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,600
Incredibly sweet though.

896
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,080
Um...

897
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,320
That we...

898
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,380
Let her...

899
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,920
You know...

900
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,360
That I ended up having a meet and greet with her.

901
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:07,940
Um...

902
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,380
And everything.

903
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,920
Oh, she said she said the quiet part out loud.

904
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:18,260
Guys, I don't think I'm gonna... I think the first try was as good as it's gonna get.

905
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:24,040
I don't think I'm gonna get better score than that.

906
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,560
But, um... Canonical egg goon.

907
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,880
I don't think it was a super chat.

908
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,220
Thank you.

909
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:29,840
Thank you.

910
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,020
Oh, yeah, I'll tweet the picture later.

911
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,020
But the first thing I ate out of the cake was I literally just bit off the head of the long goon.

912
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,000
And then I just put it back in the fridge.

913
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:43,040
I ate more of the cake after that, though.

914
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,220
But, like, the first thing I ate from that cake was literally the head of the long goon.

915
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,380
And I was like, that's good enough.

916
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,700
As he deserves.

917
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,000
Devon, welcome to Tomato Farm.

918
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,820
Welcome, welcome.

919
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:56,840
Um...

920
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,080
Of course, of course it's the long goon.

921
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,860
He needs to be punished for his crimes.

922
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,840
Ba-da-da-dum.

923
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,280
Ba-da-da-dum.

924
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,280
Ba-da-da-dum.

925
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,560
Ba-da-da-dum.

926
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,000
Ba-da-dum.

927
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,420
Ba-da-dum.

928
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,540
Ba-da-dum.

929
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,020
Ba-da-dum.

930
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,300
Oh, my god.

931
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,460
You'll never be able to touch.

932
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,440
That's right.

933
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,180
I'm gonna Romeo and Juliet you.

934
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,360
You'll never be able to meet your true love.

935
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,420
Yeah, get married first.

936
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:34,040
Just no touching until marriage.

937
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,020
Doomed Yuri.

938
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,340
Could be Doomed Yowie, you don't know that.

939
00:36:53,770 --> 00:37:01,310
Oh my gosh though, but seeing all the concerts that were happening throughout the Anime Expo week.

940
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,490
Luca, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

941
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:11,510
Dookie brings cyberbullets children and makes little girls cry after 4-seer to gamble more at 5 p.m.

942
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,350
Fake news!

943
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:18,390
I don't talk to people who spread fake news.

944
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,530
Sharko, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

945
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,430
Dibs, I'm the long goon, Dookie8.

946
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,650
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

947
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:38,810
Um, but like, it's very inspiring to see like all the, uh, the amazing concerts that were going on during, um, Anime Expo.

948
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,690
Um, um, I, I, I definitely would love to do something.

949
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:44,130
Oh, hey!

950
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,310
Grenade!

951
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,610
Wait, I don't even know where to put it, to be fair.

952
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,450
Maybe like, here?

953
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,090
Fire in the hole!

954
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:53,010
Okay.

955
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,030
Okay, that did nothing.

956
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:05,830
Okay, I, I tricked him more, but that's okay.

957
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,050
Sometimes, sometimes it's okay to be disappointed.

958
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,030
Sometimes, that's, that's fine.

959
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,470
Life is meant to be disappointing.

960
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:15,870
Wait, what?

961
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,930
Oh, fuck, she's gone.

962
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,850
Just like that.

963
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,230
She's gone.

964
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,530
She fucking disappeared.

965
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,510
It's like a ghost.

966
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,610
Alright, this time.

967
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,350
Wait, what happened to my grenade?

968
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,730
Oh my god, okay.

969
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:38,590
It's like, my grenade, it just disappeared.

970
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,950
What happened to it?

971
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,410
Minto jumpscare.

972
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,090
Yeah, I was like, what?

973
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,010
Oh my god, it's Minto.

974
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,070
Yeah, I would love to do more concerts in the future.

975
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,750
Um, I don't know.

976
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,560
I never really...

977
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,650
I, I don't...

978
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,370
Uh...

979
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,050
Because like, you know...

980
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:01,430
Uh, usually those invitations go towards like, the singers.

981
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,490
Oh shit, that's where you'll never touch.

982
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:08,770
You'll never touch.

983
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,170
I'm literally...

984
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,210
I have four squares.

985
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,210
I just need one more.

986
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:19,890
Um...

987
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:23,430
Yeah, I don't see myself as an actual singer-singer, though.

988
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:29,410
Uh, but it would be amazing to be invited to do, like, an actual concert setting.

989
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,790
Because mine was, like, at Anime Expo, but it was more geared towards, like...

990
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,330
I feel like it was more like a showcase versus, like, an actual concert setting, where, you know...

991
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,870
Um, like, uh...

992
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,230
Why are they showing their hoes?

993
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,050
Because they're whores.

994
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:46,630
They saw what Pom Pom Perrin did, and thought this was all they have to do now.

995
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:51,590
So, yeah, I'm going to totally... Pom Pom Perrin is a bad example to the children.

996
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,750
He's a bad role model!

997
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:57,670
Oh my god, dead!

998
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:58,490
Whoa!

999
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,630
But yeah, I'm just... I'm happy to give you guys a free concert, though.

1000
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,130
I'm happy, but yeah, I would love to.

1001
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:09,890
It was such a great...

1002
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,530
Oh my god, he's so chonky.

1003
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,970
If he does become that chonky, I...

1004
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:15,530
Like, I...

1005
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:18,450
Um, he is definitely going to go on a diet or get something.

1006
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,930
I would never want a wiener dog to be that chonky.

1007
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,990
But yeah, I'd love to be...

1008
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,730
Uh, I want to, you know, like...

1009
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,390
Also, like, I don't know, I was, like, thinking about it.

1010
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,010
I think if I ever do, like, another...

1011
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,790
If I want to do a giant-ass project, like, the next...

1012
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,410
Um...

1013
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:40,210
I guess, like, level of organizing I want to do...

1014
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:41,750
But, okay, it's very hard.

1015
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:43,970
I know concert organization is very, very hard.

1016
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,090
Because, like...

1017
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,570
You know, like, the Phantom Thief shit?

1018
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,030
That was more so, like...

1019
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:51,430
We just show up, and we just show up, sing, and dance.

1020
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:54,330
So, like, we don't have to do, like, the actual, like...

1021
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,630
Organizing and the planning of anything, like Min and I.

1022
00:40:59,490 --> 00:40:59,890
Um...

1023
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,190
But, like, the one thing I really...

1024
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,630
Want to do...

1025
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,430
Is have a concert.

1026
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,390
Like, an actual concert venue and everything.

1027
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:09,850
Um...

1028
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:11,450
Is, like...

1029
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,350
Um...

1030
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,390
At, like...

1031
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,350
Uh...

1032
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:15,230
In, like, I...

1033
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,290
In Asia and Europe.

1034
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,730
And Canada.

1035
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,870
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1036
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,690
America has it too good!

1037
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,290
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1038
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,730
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1039
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,490
I think it'd be cool.

1040
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:31,130
I think it'd be cool to have, like, a little world tour of stuff.

1041
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:32,730
With, like, Indies and everything.

1042
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:33,930
Um...

1043
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,150
But, like I said, I...

1044
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,090
Like...

1045
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,550
It can't be free.

1046
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,510
Ha ha ha ha!

1047
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,390
Which sucks.

1048
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,270
Um...

1049
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,690
That's the one thing that...

1050
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,050
I mean, it can be.

1051
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,230
If, like...

1052
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,710
Regarding, like...

1053
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:47,630
Uh...

1054
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,510
Oh...

1055
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,670
You're slowly going down.

1056
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,870
You're slowly going lower and lower and lower.

1057
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,470
Yeah, cause, like...

1058
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,890
Patch...

1059
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:57,430
Like, I told you guys how much it actually costs to make my free.

1060
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,950
Concert.

1061
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,490
And that's why, like...

1062
00:41:59,490 --> 00:41:59,930
Um...

1063
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,110
By the way, like...

1064
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,090
Min and I, we made...

1065
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:07,010
I would say we made a lot.

1066
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,290
From, like, merch sales and concert tickets.

1067
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:11,710
Um...

1068
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,990
And even then, like...

1069
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,290
That was after the profit split with the organizers, too.

1070
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,870
So, like...

1071
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,650
Um...

1072
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:21,250
It is, like, money-wise.

1073
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,190
Like, that's why people do concerts and stuff.

1074
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,290
I don't know if you guys know this.

1075
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:25,710
Uh...

1076
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,170
But, um...

1077
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,510
Well, for me, it was a lot.

1078
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,010
I don't know.

1079
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:32,510
For, I guess, like, other performers, it might not be considered a lot.

1080
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,550
But I thought it was a lot.

1081
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:34,370
Uh...

1082
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,870
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1083
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,290
But if you guys didn't know, uh...

1084
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:44,350
Uh...

1085
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,650
For, like...

1086
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,230
For musicians and performers...

1087
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:49,950
Um...

1088
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,470
The b- The most they make...

1089
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,010
The money...

1090
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:53,830
The mo- Uh...

1091
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:54,230
Uh...

1092
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:55,910
Sorry, I can't fucking talk.

1093
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:09,810
But, um, the most they earn from, like, the sources of income they get the most out of is from concerts and merch.

1094
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:15,450
That's, uh, literally, like, uh, they make money from the merch and the concerts themselves.

1095
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:21,670
So, like, to be fair, though, I spent a lot of money, because, like, in general, on, like, dance lessons.

1096
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:31,030
And, uh, dance lessons, as well as, uh, uh, you know, prepping for the concert and, like, traveling as well.

1097
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,830
And stuff like that.

1098
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:39,570
So, like, you know, um, but I still made quite a good amount from the Phantom Thief stuff.

1099
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:49,250
Um, I feel like if I ever want to plan something where I want to do another concert for, like, maybe, like, an indie concert thing.

1100
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:51,090
Um...

1101
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,830
I'd love to have it hosted and either, like, you know, cat, like, maybe, like, a tour thing.

1102
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,150
Oh, that would be so cool.

1103
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:01,550
Like an, an indie tour.

1104
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:07,150
But, like, I don't know, I think the only way to get invited for something like that is to, like, make it my own.

1105
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,470
Because I don't think I'd get invited.

1106
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:13,430
I don't think, I don't think I'd, I'd get invited since I'm not really a singer.

1107
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:17,030
And they, like, they'll invite the actual singers if they want to make an indie concert.

1108
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:17,970
And they...

1109
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:24,910
Like, an indie concert with, like, you know, merch and, like, venue and stuff.

1110
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:29,070
I feel like the only way I can get invited is if I have to make it myself.

1111
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,190
Um...

1112
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:38,390
Never say never?

1113
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,150
I don't know.

1114
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,490
I just feel like, I mean, like, if they want to sell seats and stuff, it makes sense though.

1115
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:45,790
You want someone that can sing.

1116
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,010
And I just, like, I literally shitpost.

1117
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,330
I still want to do, like, variety shows and stuff too.

1118
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,190
Like, not just, like...

1119
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:02,410
Like, okay, when I...

1120
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,370
I'm planning, guys, by the way...

1121
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,130
Uh...

1122
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:07,470
By the way, I'm already, like...

1123
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:07,850
Ever since...

1124
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:10,250
After the concert was over...

1125
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:12,430
Um...

1126
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,350
After the concert was over, like, today, this morning, I was talking to the production team.

1127
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:18,710
And...

1128
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:19,130
Uh...

1129
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,650
We're planning on...

1130
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:21,210
Um...

1131
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:22,810
I'm starting my plans right now.

1132
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:24,190
With...

1133
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:24,390
Uh...

1134
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,490
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

1135
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:26,210
Uh...

1136
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:29,150
With them regarding, like, an official 3D debut.

1137
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:30,270
And stuff.

1138
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:33,290
So, like, you know, there'll be, like, variety stuff and things.

1139
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,250
Like, what you see in a normal 3D debut.

1140
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:37,450
But yeah, I'm starting plans with them right now.

1141
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:39,090
And, like, discussing what I want to do.

1142
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:40,410
But yeah.

1143
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:41,750
I'm super excited.

1144
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:42,650
I can finally...

1145
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,870
After the debut, I can finally use my...

1146
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:46,450
3D model normally.

1147
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:52,890
I can actually use my 3D model right after.

1148
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:53,730
Oh, shit.

1149
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,010
I was not paying attention.

1150
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:55,850
I...

1151
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,810
I was...

1152
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,570
I think this might be my worst run.

1153
00:45:58,990 --> 00:45:59,370
Oh, shit.

1154
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,790
Hey, mint.

1155
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:01,910
Wait, what was...

1156
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:02,290
Oh, wait.

1157
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:02,830
Booty hole.

1158
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:04,650
I was like, wait, what is she though?

1159
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:07,850
I forgot what dragoon that's supposed to be.

1160
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,110
Um...

1161
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:11,670
You filled 1,800 person call to capacity.

1162
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:12,770
You can still...

1163
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,290
Oh, thank you, Nexi.

1164
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,110
I really appreciate it.

1165
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:16,910
Yeah, but...

1166
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:18,870
It was also free, though.

1167
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,990
It was a free concept.

1168
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:27,390
Uh...

1169
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:27,850
Uh...

1170
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:28,210
Taste.

1171
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1172
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:29,510
Thank you.

1173
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,230
Thank you.

1174
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:30,470
Thank you.

1175
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:31,050
Hi, Doki.

1176
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,110
Thanks for playing our game.

1177
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,410
Sorry if the grenade is bugged.

1178
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:35,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1179
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:35,990
Thank you.

1180
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:36,430
Thank you.

1181
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:36,790
Yeah.

1182
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,270
Thank you for making this game.

1183
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:39,690
I really appreciate it.

1184
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,250
I love...

1185
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,690

1186
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:42,390
Oh my gosh.

Also like...

1188
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,490
I'm actually...

1189
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:45,710
I love...

1190
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:46,510
I love like...

1191
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,010
How creative people can get.

1192
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,490
Especially like the mini games and stuff that you guys make.

1193
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:51,570
Um...

1194
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,690
So I really appreciate it.

1195
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,410
You guys made this for free for me.

1196
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,130
Thank you.

1197
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:56,970
Um...

1198
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:57,330
Yeah.

1199
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1200
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,730
Thank you.

1201
00:46:58,810 --> 00:46:59,290
Thank you.

1202
00:46:59,290 --> 00:46:59,810
Thank you.

1203
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,110
Holy shit.

1204
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:00,710
It's...

1205
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:01,310
It's...

1206
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,010
Dookie Bird.

1207
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:04,810
Can't believe I won that 50-50 for the meet and greet.

1208
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:06,070
Also...

1209
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:06,330
Uh...

1210
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,410
Please let super...

1211
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:07,730
No.

1212
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:08,270
Never.

1213
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,370
I'll never let them touch.

1214
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:11,170
Haha.

1215
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:12,610
Haha.

1216
00:47:12,610 --> 00:47:12,790
Haha.

1217
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:13,370
It's a sin.

1218
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1219
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:15,790
Thank you.

1220
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:16,590
Thank you.

1221
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:19,690
Um...

1222
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:20,130
JP.

1223
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,390
Thank you for the super chat.

1224
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:21,670
Thank you.

1225
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,230
Thank you.

1226
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,130
I can't believe I see Watake at a concert.

1227
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:27,230
I was all over the moon when I heard it.

1228
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,090
Uh...

1229
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:29,570
Unfortunately, security told us to sit down at first.

1230
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:31,410
But for whatever reason, Lily let us back up.

1231
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,250
Great performance.

1232
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:32,830
Thank you.

1233
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:33,630
Thank you for the super chat.

1234
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:33,890
Thank you.

1235
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,350
Thank you.

1236
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:34,990
Oh yeah.

1237
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:36,350
So I saw someone...

1238
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,110
Uh...

1239
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:39,690
Um...

1240
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,710
I saw someone mentioned...

1241
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,450
Um...

1242
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,130
That...

1243
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:45,270
Um...

1244
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:48,030
About my surprise appearance in...

1245
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:48,590
Uh...

1246
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:49,290
The...

1247
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:50,890
Virtual vacation...

1248
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:51,250
Um...

1249
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,150
On Doobie Song.

1250
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,030
And...

1251
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,210
Yeah!

1252
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:55,630
Now you know why I was so fucking busy all the time.

1253
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:02,130
Uh...

1254
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:02,230
Uh...

1255
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,310
Someone asked- Okay.

1256
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:04,850
I want you guys to know...

1257
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,350
Who are that song specifically?

1258
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,850
I think Min and I were both in a similar situation.

1259
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:09,990
Like...

1260
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,310
Uh...

1261
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:11,470
Min literally...

1262
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:11,950
Uh...

1263
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:12,650
We were like...

1264
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,650
Both traveling around that time.

1265
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:15,730
When...

1266
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:16,210
Um...

1267
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:16,830
We were...

1268
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,010
As to...

1269
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:18,870
When like...

1270
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,150
We were asked to like...

1271
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,710
Record it.

1272
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,390
And so we're like, oh, fuck.

1273
00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:32,890
So literally, the day we came back from our travels, because we were both traveling for our own concerts that we're doing, like, you know, her, for her.

1274
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:39,890
We were all, like, traveling to prepare and stuff and record for, like, because she has, like, several appearances in 3D.

1275
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:48,330
And I was trying to, like, you know, practice for, like, my concert and stuff like that and preparing for my concert.

1276
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:51,470
So, um, we're like, we got time.

1277
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:59,670
And literally, when we had to record for it, for the backings of Home... Oh, goodbye, little egg.

1278
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:08,430
When, um... We had one day... Well, I had one day to record it before the deadline.

1279
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:13,530
Like, I literally just got back from... From traveling.

1280
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:24,150
And... And... I learned... I learned... I learned the song in two hours, and then I hit record.

1281
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:25,130
And then...

1282
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,310
And then I sent it over.

1283
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:36,510
I... I was like, I'm sorry.

1284
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:40,690
Clutch.

1285
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,590
Clutch.

1286
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,070
Clutch as fuck.

1287
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,370
You guys can't tell, though.

1288
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,230
You guys couldn't tell I recorded that in a day within two hours.

1289
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:51,250
Uh... And it took me another two hours to finish recording it.

1290
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:53,910
Uh... Bro...

1291
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:56,390
Whoa!

1292
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,570
Look at that chonky boy.

1293
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:06,310
Let's see.

1294
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,070
Geo!

1295
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:08,030
Thank you for the super chat!

1296
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,410
Thank you!

1297
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:09,090
Thank you!

1298
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:13,010
Doki, we are asking for... We are asking for paid streaming when the concert dropped.

1299
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,310
I'm pretty sure lots of people would go and watch your concert!

1300
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:15,850
Ah!

1301
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,390
Thank you, Geo!

1302
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,210
I really appreciate it.

1303
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:19,910
Thank you.

1304
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:20,890
I don't know.

1305
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:23,170
The hard part for that is just to find, like...

1306
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:26,530
I'm pretty sure, like... I have no idea how that works.

1307
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,770
Like, the paid streaming shit.

1308
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:28,350
Like...

1309
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:32,970
I think you need, like, to set up a contract with some... Like, a fucking...

1310
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:35,090
Like, company that does that shit.

1311
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,850
And then... Oh my god.

1312
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:37,750
A lot of logistics.

1313
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:39,410
I don't know anything about it, though.

1314
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:41,870
Um...

1315
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,670
Um...

1316
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,630
But yeah, that's, like, something...

1317
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:46,790
Um...

1318
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:47,510
I don't know.

1319
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:48,610
I...

1320
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,650
I don't know.

1321
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,050
I would love to do it again in the future.

1322
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:52,810
Cause it was fun!

1323
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:53,810
It was really fun.

1324
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,430
And it was fun seeing, like...

1325
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:58,410
Uh...

1326
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:01,230
Seeing all the people, like, you know...

1327
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:02,350
Um...

1328
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,470
Cheering and, like...

1329
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:05,190
Um...

1330
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:06,910
Cheering for the Oshi and everything.

1331
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,290
It's always such a...

1332
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,370
Like, a fun scene.

1333
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:09,910
Like...

1334
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,050
Just, like, fun to see in the clips and stuff.

1335
00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:12,910
Uh...

1336
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:14,230
Next scene, thank you for the super chat!

1337
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:14,530
Thank you!

1338
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:15,210
Thank you!

1339
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:18,310
I know people who flew in and got hotels to see your concert.

1340
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:19,530
Not necessarily free!

1341
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:21,090
Thank you again for the super chat!

1342
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:21,450
Thank you!

1343
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,270
Thank you again!

1344
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:26,410
I really appreciate everybody that came to Anime Expo.

1345
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,770
And, um...

1346
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,870
To watch the concert and had a lot of fun.

1347
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:30,930
I really appreciate it.

1348
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:31,490
Oh yeah!

1349
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,430
For the polished version...

1350
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:34,470
Of...

1351
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:35,810
I don't know what to do with this grenade.

1352
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:37,650
Like...

1353
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:38,150
I...

1354
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,290
I don't know.

1355
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,210
But, for the polished version of the concert...

1356
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:43,590
Um...

1357
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:45,690
I'm also in talks with them right now.

1358
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,130
And...

1359
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,550
They're gonna give me the timeline...

1360
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:49,070
On when it'll be done.

1361
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:49,970
Um...

1362
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:50,290
So...

1363
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,650
I hope it won't be that long.

1364
00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:52,570
I hope it'll be like...

1365
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,270
One to two months.

1366
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:53,890
But I did...

1367
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,550
I will add an encore.

1368
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:56,590
I'm gonna add...

1369
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:57,850
Um...

1370
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,570
An encore...

1371
00:51:58,570 --> 00:51:59,410
I know I said like...

1372
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:00,270
Maybe two songs.

1373
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:01,290
But I'm just gonna add...

1374
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:02,490
One song...

1375
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:02,910
Um...

1376
00:52:02,910 --> 00:52:03,610
As an encore.

1377
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,870
Uh...

1378
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:05,850
Just so we can have...

1379
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,310
The polished version earlier.

1380
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,270
Cause I'm worried if I do two...

1381
00:52:09,270 --> 00:52:10,010
It's gonna take longer.

1382
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,970
No, I haven't decided yet.

1383
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,010
I don't know what's starting to do.

1384
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:16,190
I don't know.

1385
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:17,310
I'm not sure yet.

1386
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:18,450
Uh...

1387
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:19,470
Luke, I thank you for the super chat.

1388
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:20,130
Thank you, thank you.

1389
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:22,130
Proceeds to perform in several concerts.

1390
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,870
Um...

1391
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,030
It's not several.

1392
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:24,950
Um...

1393
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:25,830
Actually...

1394
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:26,890
It was...

1395
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:26,990
Uh...

1396
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,350
Two.

1397
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:31,430
Um...

1398
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:32,350
Actually...

1399
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,030
Uh...

1400
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,370
It was just two...

1401
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:40,990
Uh...

1402
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:41,190
Uh...

1403
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:41,470
Orca.

1404
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:42,610
Thank you for the super chat.

1405
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:43,470
Thank you, thank you.

1406
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,130
Thank you.

1407
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:45,390
So, so, so, so much...

1408
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:46,950
Jokey for holding out for our meeting.

1409
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:47,510
Green on Sunday.

1410
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:48,650
Despite your busy schedule.

1411
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:50,190
It meant the world to me.

1412
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:52,050
Split the super between you...

1413
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:52,710
Her...

1414
00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:53,390
And her.

1415
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:54,090
As her agent.

1416
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:54,690
Thanks.

1417
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:55,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1418
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,290
Thank you, thank you.

1419
00:52:56,450 --> 00:52:56,950
Oh yeah.

1420
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,390
So what Orca is saying is that...

1421
00:52:59,390 --> 00:52:59,950
Uh...

1422
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:00,550
They...

1423
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,790
Overslept...

1424
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:02,930
Uh...

1425
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,390
They overslept from my meet and greet.

1426
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:10,770
They...

1427
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,930
Didn't set up an alarm and overslept the meet and greet.

1428
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:16,390
And then...

1429
00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:17,070
Um...

1430
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,590
And then I...

1431
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:19,070
Out of the...

1432
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,530
Goodness of my own heart...

1433
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:21,650
Say...

1434
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:21,750
Uh...

1435
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:21,870
Uh...

1436
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,930
Never say I'm...

1437
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:25,870
I never...

1438
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:27,710
Never say I'm not a good person.

1439
00:53:28,190 --> 00:53:28,530
Um...

1440
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,530
Out of the goodness of my own heart...

1441
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:31,830
Say...

1442
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,110
Uh...

1443
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:33,250
Came back...

1444
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,530
An hour later...

1445
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,910
To finish my meet and greet.

1446
00:53:37,170 --> 00:53:39,230
I'm so kind and humble, guys.

1447
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:40,530
So humble.

1448
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:47,350
Uh...

1449
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,030
Uh...

1450
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:48,530
Let's see.

1451
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,050
However...

1452
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,030
Can't be true.

1453
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:52,210
Uh...

1454
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:52,590
Oh my god.

1455
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:53,650
Can the code...

1456
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,510
The cookies cannot touch.

1457
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:56,610
Cos then it'd be a murder.

1458
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:58,090
Uh...

1459
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:58,470
Uh...

1460
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:00,510
Uh...

1461
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:00,880
Uh...

1462
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:05,390
Uh...

1463
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,930
Yeah, um, you would be fine.

1464
00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:11,690
Alright, touch.

1465
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,990
Nice, dracoons can touch, though.

1466
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:16,090
I don't mind if the goons touch.

1467
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,690
Oh my god, not the rat.

1468
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:22,590
But if the croquis touch, then the world will end.

1469
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:23,250
Hon!

1470
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,910
Well, uh, thank you for that one gifted chip.

1471
00:54:26,050 --> 00:54:26,890
Thank you, thank you.

1472
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,670
Ba-da-da-dum.

1473
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,070
Ba-da-da-dum.

1474
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,410
Ba-da-dum-bum.

1475
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:34,090
Maybe I can make him touch here.

1476
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:35,310
I'll force it.

1477
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:36,830
I want the dragon winch to touch, though.

1478
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:37,970
That's fine.

1479
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:39,130
Um.

1480
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,170
Johnny, thank you for the super chat.

1481
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:44,030
Thank you, thank you.

1482
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:47,110
Upcoming pay stream plus membership equals easy money.

1483
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,150
Thank you for the super chat.

1484
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:48,730
Thank you, thank you.

1485
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,670
I mean, that's true.

1486
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:50,970
I can make that membership.

1487
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,630
But then, like, ah, I guess, like, membership chip.

1488
00:54:54,770 --> 00:54:59,210
Ah, no, because then, like, you know, if it's, like, an indie concert, I want to be able to...

1489
00:54:59,210 --> 00:54:59,730
What?

1490
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,510
What happened to my grenade?

1491
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,330
Oh, I keep forgetting!

1492
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,410
The grenade merges into the dragoon.

1493
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:12,430
Um, but then, like, you know, if I'm doing an indie concert with other indies, um, I'd want to, like, split the profits.

1494
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,070
Obviously, split the profits with them.

1495
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,510
Um, Fuzzy, thank you for the super chat.

1496
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:17,430
Thank you, thank you.

1497
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,410
Double tapping my member with a thank you for the concert.

1498
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,910
And thanks for continuing to be our favorite giggle bird!

1499
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:25,890
From an old-ass otaku ojisan.

1500
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:26,750
Thank you!

1501
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:27,870
Thank you for the super chat.

1502
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:28,910
Thank you, thank you.

1503
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,410
I really appreciate it.

1504
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,470
Thank you, thank you.

1505
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:33,910
Manny, thank you for the super chat.

1506
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:34,830
Thank you, thank you.

1507
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,530
Thanks for letting me hold the chest toggle at the meet and greet.

1508
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:39,790
Um, also, could I get a happy birthday?

1509
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,690
Mine was literally right after yours.

1510
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,010
And it was super busy.

1511
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:44,010
Of course, Manny.

1512
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:46,150
Oh my gosh, he's so greedy.

1513
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,270
This is the greed in the Bible, Manny.

1514
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:57,930
Happy birthday to you.

1515
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:00,650
Happy birthday to you.

1516
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,390
Happy birthday, dear Manny.

1517
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,150
Happy birthday to you.

1518
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:06,730
Yeah!

1519
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:08,190
Happy birthday!

1520
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:10,610
Your green seconds, Manny.

1521
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:16,310
Um...

1522
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:17,290
Charco!

1523
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:19,270
I think we're gonna lose this, by the way.

1524
00:56:19,370 --> 00:56:20,050
Thank you, super chat.

1525
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:20,890
Thank you, thank you.

1526
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:22,890
Doki finding out she is a singer.

1527
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,950
It's like Hagrid telling Harry that he is a wizard.

1528
00:56:25,170 --> 00:56:26,370
This is a compliment, by the way.

1529
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:27,170
Thank you, super chat.

1530
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,050
Thank you, thank you.

1531
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:29,690
Really appreciate it.

1532
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:31,510
Oh, he's dead.

1533
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:32,210
Alright.

1534
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,130
Yeah, I'm never gonna get my peek.

1535
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,330
I'm never... I don't even know how.

1536
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:38,630
It just literally just happened.

1537
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:43,050
I'll never know how it happened.

1538
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:46,230
I'm just naturally gifted.

1539
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,270
What can I say?

1540
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:49,070
Okay.

1541
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,110
And then this will turn into a giant goon.

1542
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,330
A chonky goon.

1543
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,400
Oh my god.

1544
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,200
Already another grenade?

1545
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,980
I don't expect a grenade that fast.

1546
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:43,280
Oh yeah, by the way, I know I keep talking, like, everyone's, like, super hyped that I'm thinking about, like, organizing something like that.

1547
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,600
That's not gonna happen for a very long time, sorry.

1548
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:50,560
I need... I need rest.

1549
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,300
I still cry.

1550
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,760
If I actually ever try anything like that, I cannot.

1551
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,020
I'm tired.

1552
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,440
I'm... I'm so tired.

1553
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:04,900
Yes.

1554
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:07,140
Guys, I'm so tired.

1555
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:13,300
My brain has been, like, I swear to God, I feel like I've been, like, brain rotted.

1556
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,280
After.

1557
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,020
But will it happen eventually?

1558
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:17,680
I don't know.

1559
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,780
I definitely need sponsors for that.

1560
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,320
Let's see.

1561
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,420
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

1562
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:32,780
Thank you.

1563
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,660
Thank you.

1564
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,720
Continuing the birthday change.

1565
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,720
My birthday today.

1566
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,260
Can I also get a happy birthday?

1567
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,200
Of course, Marshall.

1568
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,520
Happy birthday to you.

1569
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,800
Happy birthday to you.

1570
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,260
Happy birthday, dear Marshall.

1571
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:48,720
Happy birthday to you.

1572
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,160
Yeah, happy birthday!

1573
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,400
Happy birthday, Marshall.

1574
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,500
We have a great birthday.

1575
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:57,000
This is like the one time you'll get your super chats read.

1576
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,560
Like, in a timely manner.

1577
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,440
This is the 100% gotcha rate.

1578
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,120
Thank you!

1579
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,460
Thank you for this super chat!

1580
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:09,880
Thank you!

1581
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:16,100
If Jack Jesus himself asked you to do the Jesus combo, would that count as Jesus asking?

1582
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,240
Thank you for this super chat!

1583
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:20,240
I don't think...

1584
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,540
I don't think he'll ask for it.

1585
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,600
Thank you for this super chat!

1586
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,140
Thank you!

1587
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:26,960
Thank you!

1588
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,040
Bro, that meant...

1589
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,440
I don't think he'll ask for it, guys.

1590
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:33,320
Um...

1591
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,120
I know a lot of people are like, When will you play the horse game, Toki?

1592
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,400
If I ever...

1593
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,960
You have to bribe me to play the horse game, guys.

1594
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,920
Literally, okay...

1595
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,620
Literally, um...

1596
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,120
I watched a little bit...

1597
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,340
Cause like...

1598
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,540
This morning...

1599
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,440
Cause apparently, Littlewig was hosting a tournament or some shit.

1600
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,960
And, um...

1601
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,180
And I was curious...

1602
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:56,780
Okay...

1603
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,840
Like...

1604
00:59:57,840 --> 00:59:58,920
Uh...

1605
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,420
The actual, like...

1606
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,260
The part where...

1607
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:03,160
I felt like the part where it gets exciting...

1608
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:03,920
Was when they have...

1609
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,120
They actually start racing.

1610
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,680
But that was, like...

1611
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:07,620
1%...

1612
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,100
Of, like...

1613
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,540
99% of the rest of...

1614
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,100
There was so much reading!

1615
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,800
There was...

1616
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:17,440
There was...

1617
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:32,600
There was...

1618
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,220
Just skip it.

1619
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:35,900
It'll be fine.

1620
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:36,580
Don't worry.

1621
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,640
Just ignore this horse game.

1622
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:42,640
I want my sakura after Elder Ring.

1623
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:44,480
So you're saying there's a chat.

1624
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,880
Thank you for the Akka soup.

1625
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,320
Thank you.

1626
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:49,160
Thank you.

1627
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,460
Thank you for the Akka soup.

1628
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,640
Thank you.

1629
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,400
Subscribe to play the horse game.

1630
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,400
Scythe, thank you for the super chat.

1631
01:00:57,540 --> 01:00:57,820
Thank you.

1632
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:58,540
Thank you.

1633
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,400
There's plenty of options to skip.

1634
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,560
And then they were like... Oh my god.

1635
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:19,580
Like... Oh, I was just... I was... Okay, I will say the interesting parts about the horse game were not even like the actual game itself.

1636
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,200
But the fact that they were like, you know, based off of the real horses.

1637
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:26,160
And like... Like I got into the rabbit hole.

1638
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:28,660
Um... Uh...

1639
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:34,540
I got into the rabbit hole of reading the actual like... Um...

1640
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:39,440
The actual like... Uh... History behind the real horses themselves.

1641
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,080
So you know how like how everybody is like in love with Gold Ship?

1642
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:43,820
Or whatever?

1643
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:44,840
Um...

1644
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,700
Because of like her quirkiness and everything?

1645
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:50,240
And apparently the horse in real life was also like...

1646
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,960
By the way, he's still alive, by the way.

1647
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,420
Some of these horses are still alive.

1648
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,520
But the... What's her name?

1649
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,180
The Haru?

1650
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,360
Whatever her name is.

1651
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,500
The pink hair girl?

1652
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,740
Or like people were like... Um...

1653
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:02,160
I never because... Give up because...

1654
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:05,940
She never gave... Because she never gave up on us too.

1655
01:02:07,340 --> 01:02:09,340
Um... She's a grandma right now.

1656
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,800
So... I think like... Um...

1657
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:14,560
Um... She's apparently like... Uh... A grandma right now.

1658
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:15,820
Um...

1659
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:17,680
Because like... I think she's like... What?

1660
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:18,980
20...

1661
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,700
Uh... She's like 28 or something.

1662
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,820
And... Uh... Horse life expectancy is like 30 years old.

1663
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,340
So like...

1664
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,300
Tick tock.

1665
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:28,960
Um...

1666
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:29,320
Oh sorry.

1667
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:30,040
That got real dark.

1668
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,320
Um...

1669
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:33,900
Yeah.

1670
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,340
She's 29 and I'm crying.

1671
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:37,660
Damn.

1672
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:44,320
Oh my god.

1673
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,780
Why did you tell me this?

1674
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:47,880
Um...

1675
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:49,740
That was harsh.

1676
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,660
Oh my god.

1677
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:56,640
Anyway.

1678
01:02:58,020 --> 01:02:58,600
So...

1679
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,020
Okay.

1680
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:00,180
So...

1681
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:01,480
Um...

1682
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,760
Um...

1683
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,420
Um...

1684
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,320
So gold ship.

1685
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,900
I thought it was...

1686
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:07,880
Really interesting.

1687
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:09,580
Like her... Um...

1688
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,080
His lore.

1689
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:11,440
Um...

1690
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:11,940
And... Oh yeah.

1691
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:13,080
The saddest part.

1692
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:13,520
By the way.

1693
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:14,440
I'll make you guys more sad.

1694
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:15,260
But...

1695
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,300
The saddest part about Haru...

1696
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,160
Is that...

1697
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:19,180
They never let...

1698
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,220
Let them have kids.

1699
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:20,860
Or him.

1700
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:21,180
Right?

1701
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,520
The actual horse is a guy.

1702
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,320
But...

1703
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:24,780
Um...

1704
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:25,580
Haru...

1705
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:26,960
Was never allowed to have kids.

1706
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,120
After retirement.

1707
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,540
So like...

1708
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:30,680
They had no bitches.

1709
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:32,140
So...

1710
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:32,260
Uh...

1711
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,840
Why did he give me three fucking rats?

1712
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:35,360
Okay.

1713
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:36,460
Um...

1714
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:36,560
Yeah.

1715
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:37,260
So like...

1716
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:37,840
Literally...

1717
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,600
There's no descendants.

1718
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:39,680
Oh her.

1719
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:39,980
Sorry.

1720
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:40,640
She...

1721
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,020
She was not allowed...

1722
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:42,800
To have...

1723
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:43,040
She...

1724
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:43,940
Well they never like...

1725
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:44,680
Let her have kids.

1726
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:45,740
So...

1727
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,340
Zero wins.

1728
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:47,880
I...

1729
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,320
Cause like...

1730
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:49,240
You know...

1731
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:50,920
Um...

1732
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,140
Um...

1733
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:52,340
Cause that's...

1734
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,900
What I need to say.

1735
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,580
No.

1736
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:57,260
No.

1737
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:57,520
Sorry.

1738
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,600
Your horse waifu is...

1739
01:03:59,200 --> 01:03:59,760
Actually...

1740
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:00,220
Um...

1741
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,000
Actually a woman.

1742
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:01,720
But yeah.

1743
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:03,280
Uh...

1744
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:04,760
She wasn't...

1745
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:05,460
Uh...

1746
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:06,440
She wasn't like...

1747
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:07,780
Allowed to have any kids.

1748
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:08,960
Um...

1749
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:09,660
So like...

1750
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:11,280
The bloodline ends with her.

1751
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,060
Unfortunately.

1752
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:14,300
Um...

1753
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:15,420
Uh...

1754
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:15,740
Um...

1755
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:16,140
Excuse me.

1756
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,980
It's one win and 113 noses now.

1757
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,360
But who is a...

1758
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,140
Who is a woman?

1759
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,140
What the fuck is this?

1760
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:22,380
Okay.

1761
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:23,740
When I said leave room for Jesus.

1762
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,000
I didn't mean leave this giant asshole.

1763
01:04:26,260 --> 01:04:27,140
In the middle.

1764
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:27,860
Anyway.

1765
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:29,160
As I was saying.

1766
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:29,760
Okay.

1767
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,860
We definitely lost that.

1768
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:33,660
Um...

1769
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,680
Um...

1770
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,120
But...

1771
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,760
Goldship is actually a man.

1772
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:37,740
Um...

1773
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:38,260
And like...

1774
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:39,380
He's apparently...

1775
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:39,760
Like...

1776
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:40,820
Really...

1777
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,380
Popular with the ladies.

1778
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:43,660
And...

1779
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:44,340
Basically...

1780
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,200
Goldship...

1781
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,480
After his retirement...

1782
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:46,840
Like...

1783
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,340
All the lady horses...

1784
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:49,120
Would run up to him.

1785
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,860
And be like...

1786
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:50,980
Yeah...

1787
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,180
Haha...

1788
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,900
He was a playa...

1789
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,980
He was actually an actual player.

1790
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,240
Like, you... I was reading a thread about... Yeah, he's a parent.

1791
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:08,620
He has insane riz.

1792
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:12,540
And he has around, like, over 500 kids, by the way.

1793
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,880
And, like, all the lady horses would, like, run up to him and be like, me next!

1794
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:18,660
Me next!

1795
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:22,420
That's my goat!

1796
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,580
And, like, I thought this was, like, a little funny, fun fact.

1797
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:35,500
Where, um... Um... During, like, he thought he was... Oh, shit, she disappeared.

1798
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,180
She died.

1799
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,800
Like, um... One of the, like... This was a funny, like, history tidbit.

1800
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:50,780
But, basically, one time... Um... He thought he was going to the, uh... You know... The... Make a Kid Pro...

1801
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:54,560
He thought he was going to meet the ladies one day.

1802
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:57,760
Like, he was like, oh, yes, it's ladies' time, you know?

1803
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,480
And then, um... And then, like, the trainers tricked him.

1804
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,760
And it was actually to meet the fans.

1805
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,700
So, it was, like, a meet and greet... Meet and greet program.

1806
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,120
Um... And then, after... He pretended to be, like, okay with it.

1807
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:14,080
It's like, oh, that's okay.

1808
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,260
I love meeting fans.

1809
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:19,580
And then, after the meet and greet was over, apparently, he threw a temper tantrum.

1810
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,460
And was so fucking pissed off.

1811
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:24,460
Because you're like, what do you... Where are my bitches at?

1812
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,200
Like...

1813
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,420
He had, like, a fucking crash show.

1814
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:33,020
Right at... Right after, like, the meet and greet was over.

1815
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:34,780
He's like, how can't... How dare you?

1816
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,400
I was ready!

1817
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,880
He, he, he, he, he, he, he...

1818
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,260
Oh, I did.

1819
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:43,620
Um...

1820
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:46,120
And another, um...

1821
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:51,360
Another fun fact, but apparently, like, he was, like, an incredibly smart horse.

1822
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:57,620
So that, the average horse IQ is that of a three to five year old.

1823
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,220
But, um...

1824
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,620
Goldship was, like, the average IQ of a seven year old child.

1825
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:04,780
So, like, that's scary.

1826
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:05,360
That's...

1827
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:22,480
I remember reading, like, um... like, from, like, you know, like, you know, like, little things, like, what is the worst age to take care of, um, to... when raising a child?

1828
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,440
What are the scariest ages?

1829
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:35,020
And it's, like, infant, and, like, and, like, around... and, like, it's, like, infants, because, like, you know, anything can happen when they're at an infant.

1830
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:41,360
And then it's also, like, their most troublesome age is, like, around, like, seven years old.

1831
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:48,900
Um, because, like, they're more curious, and they can walk, and, uh, they can walk and, like, actually start moving around.

1832
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,620
Oh my god, I know, because I was a piece of shit when I was around that age.

1833
01:07:53,180 --> 01:08:01,540
And, um, and, um, when I think, like, when I was around that age, I tried to run away from home.

1834
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:08,720
Um, because, like, okay, this is a pretty... I don't know if I told this story, but it's pretty dumb.

1835
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:16,260
But basically, um, we were waiting at a Chinese restaurant for our seats with me, my parents, and my grandparents.

1836
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:20,600
And I don't remember what my mom said, but it pissed me off.

1837
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:31,080
I don't... I don't even... I don't even remember what my mom said, but I... it pissed me off.

1838
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,280
And I was, like, I don't know, seven or eight.

1839
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:41,500
And then, like, because it pissed me off, like, my grandpa was, like, watching me outside the Chinese restaurant while...

1840
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:47,740
Uh, while we were, like, waiting for our number to be called to sit down, you know, because it was, like, a packed restaurant.

1841
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:50,260
So, we were just waiting for our seat.

1842
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:54,280
And then I got so mad, I, like, I just started running.

1843
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:04,600
I just... I just... I started running.

1844
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,700
And then I ran into, like, a suburban area.

1845
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:11,680
And then my... uh, yeah, a full-on sprint.

1846
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:15,820
And then my grandpa was just, like, trying to chase after me.

1847
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:18,420
But obviously, like, I was a fucking little kid.

1848
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,960
And my grandpa is a grandpa.

1849
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:22,200
And...

1850
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:26,320
I was, like, I'm gonna run away.

1851
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,400
And, like, literally run away.

1852
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:29,580
Um...

1853
01:09:30,780 --> 01:09:31,660
And then...

1854
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,040
And then my grandpa was, like, chasing me.

1855
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,760
And then I saw a police car in front of me.

1856
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:38,460
And then I slowed down and started walking.

1857
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:40,300
Because I was, like, just be...

1858
01:09:42,100 --> 01:09:42,460
Just...

1859
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:43,740
Just be normal.

1860
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,280
Like, act casual.

1861
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:46,540
They don't know I'm actually...

1862
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,540
I'm trying to run away.

1863
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:48,880
And then literally, I...

1864
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,480
I saw a police car in front of me.

1865
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,240
Uh...

1866
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,220
And then, like, with, like, the police dog, like, peeking out of the window.

1867
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:55,440
I was, like, just be normal.

1868
01:09:55,680 --> 01:09:58,500
And my grandpa was, like, so far behind, by the way.

1869
01:09:58,680 --> 01:09:59,900
He was so fucking far.

1870
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:00,660
I looked behind me.

1871
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,440
He was so far away.

1872
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:02,280
He was not gonna make it.

1873
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,100
He was...

1874
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,760
And then I just was, like, walking as if nothing weird was going on.

1875
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:14,300
And the moment the car was, like, out of view, I started running again.

1876
01:10:17,460 --> 01:10:18,340
We got...

1877
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,640
We got a runner.

1878
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:21,940
Eventually, like...

1879
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,700
Eventually, I was, like...

1880
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,200
Um...

1881
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:26,900
I don't know why.

1882
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:27,400
I just...

1883
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:28,600
I stopped running.

1884
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,880
I was, like, you know what?

1885
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:30,440
I'm tired.

1886
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:32,940
And then, like, I let my grandpa catch up to me.

1887
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:33,760
Uh...

1888
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:36,920
Eventually, I got tired.

1889
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:38,520
And I just let...

1890
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:40,020
I just let him catch up.

1891
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,600
I don't remember what that was.

1892
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,720
Is that, like, the chonky goon?

1893
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,960
I'm not angry anymore.

1894
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:50,780
I told you guys.

1895
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,720
I was actually...

1896
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,580
I was a little shit.

1897
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:54,560
Um...

1898
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,500
I was...

1899
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:57,260
I was such a little shit back then.

1900
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:00,020
Oh, you stinky rat.

1901
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,080
That's right.

1902
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:02,820
Stinkiest.

1903
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:07,100
Bum, bum, na, na, na, na, na, na.

1904
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,200
Oh, it was...

1905
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:08,860
Oh, nice!

1906
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,120
Chonky.

1907
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:12,120
Chonky, dad.

1908
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:15,740
Back then?

1909
01:11:17,340 --> 01:11:19,420
Now I'm reformed, guys.

1910
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:20,940
I'm a good person.

1911
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:26,280
Did you see that again with a straight face?

1912
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,080
I am a good person now.

1913
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:38,380
Chonky, have you seen the long, wild old umbrella bird?

1914
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,040
Wait, what's that?

1915
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:40,020
Thank you for the super chat.

1916
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:40,840
Uh, Hiro.

1917
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:41,240
Thank you.

1918
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:41,780
Thank you.

1919
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:43,680
Seijin, thank you for the super sticker.

1920
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:44,060
Thank you.

1921
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:44,640
Thank you.

1922
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,500
Ozni, thank you for the super chat.

1923
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:46,840
Thank you.

1924
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:47,440
Thank you.

1925
01:11:47,660 --> 01:11:48,580
A piece of shit.

1926
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,120
Only around that age?

1927
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1928
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:51,760
Thank you.

1929
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:52,420
Thank you.

1930
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:54,740
Uh...

1931
01:11:55,500 --> 01:12:03,020
Let's see... Oh, I missed the last super chat.

1932
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:03,800
Give me a sec.

1933
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:04,540
I'm looking back.

1934
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,640
Claps, thank you for the super chat.

1935
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:07,660
Thank you, thank you!

1936
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,580
Oh, is there a flood in Texas?

1937
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,940
I hope everybody's okay.

1938
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:21,780
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

1939
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,740
Thank you, thank you.

1940
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:28,940
Doki won't play the horse game because she's scared of making a Google Doki for threatening the horse girl with a Google glue factor.

1941
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,660
I won't even be the first one.

1942
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,600
But yeah, you'll have to, like, bribe me to play the horse game.

1943
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,820
I feel like... I just, like...

1944
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,840
I know it's, like, super popular right now.

1945
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,820
Like, everybody's playing it, even, like, the normies and stuff.

1946
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:48,860
Like, it's actually traveled outside of the normies...

1947
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:52,120
Like, outside of the normal, like, intended audience.

1948
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,760
I mean, like, of course it would.

1949
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:55,240
Because it has... it's about gambling.

1950
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:55,880
Like...

1951
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,840
Yeah, it's literally... it's mainstream right now.

1952
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,560
Like, I mean, but of course it would.

1953
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,160
It's literally, like, legal gambling.

1954
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:10,440
So I'm not...

1955
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,880
I'm... I'm not surprised.

1956
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:15,180
I'm not...

1957
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:18,980
And, like, horse racing is actually...

1958
01:13:19,540 --> 01:13:21,720
Like, I don't know if it's still popular now in America.

1959
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:22,820
But...

1960
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,280
Like, we have...

1961
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,220
Like, like I said, we.

1962
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,040
I'm... I'm Canadian, by the way.

1963
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,720
But horse racing is technically, like, really popular, right?

1964
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:31,740
In America still.

1965
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,160
It's just that they've never thought of the idea...

1966
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,880
Like, there was never, like, an actual...

1967
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:40,240
Uh...

1968
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:40,960
Not really.

1969
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:41,320
No.

1970
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,160
The Kentucky Derby.

1971
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:43,520
Yeah.

1972
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:44,200
I know...

1973
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:47,400
I know horse racing is a thing in America.

1974
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:48,620
Because...

1975
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:48,880
Oh, yeah.

1976
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,720
And it's slowly getting banned, too.

1977
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,320
I remember.

1978
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:52,160
Because I was like, no.

1979
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:53,880
Horse racing is still a thing.

1980
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:55,100
Because we love to race...

1981
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:55,540
Like...

1982
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:56,060
I'm sorry.

1983
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,400
I keep forgetting I'm not American.

1984
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,340
Um...

1985
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,460
They...

1986
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:01,540
They...

1987
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:02,580
They love to...

1988
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,060
I know you guys, too.

1989
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:06,900
I know you guys forget I'm not American, too.

1990
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:07,580
Uh...

1991
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,880
And sometimes I forget, too.

1992
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:09,860
Uh...

1993
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,640
But, like...

1994
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,700
Americans...

1995
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,920
They love to race random things.

1996
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:16,560
I...

1997
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:17,340
I don't know.

1998
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:18,360

Oh, my God.

01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,380
Holy shit.

Go, go winners.

2137
01:18:37,220 --> 01:18:37,440
Go.

2138
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,620
Han Solo doesn't need a Millennium Falcon.

2139
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:41,060
He's on to the finals.

2140
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:41,980
Oh, my God.

2141
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:43,340
His name is Han Solo?

2142
01:18:46,820 --> 01:18:51,240
In the finals, we have Frederick Footlong versus Han Solo.

2143
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:51,960
Oh, my God.

2144
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,380
It's the final match.

2145
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:53,820
All right.

2146
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:55,200
The final match, guys.

2147
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,680
He's going to win this.

01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,000
All right.

2149
01:18:59,660 --> 01:19:00,420
Start a poll.

2150
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:02,860
Finals.

2151
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,680
Han Solo versus Footlong.

2152
01:19:09,660 --> 01:19:10,240
Bro, okay.

2153
01:19:10,340 --> 01:19:10,760
Not going to lie.

2154
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,980
I think Han Solo is going to win.

2155
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,240
That dog was fucking zooming.

2156
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,540
Han Solo is the brown wiener dog.

2157
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:20,960
Han Solo all the way.

2158
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,840
It's a clash of the absolute titans.

2159
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:30,140
The winner of this race will be crowned the winner of the 2019 Wiener Dog Races champion.

2160
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:31,340
Oh, my God.

2161
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,420
The wiener dog champion.

2162
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:35,600
Look at him go.

2163
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:38,080
On your mark, get set, go.

2164
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,640
He's looking at him.

2165
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,240
He's like, on your left, grandpa.

2166
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:47,200
He may be short on legs, but he's long on heart and long on speed today.

2167
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,280
Bro, he looked at him, the B.M.

Congratulations.

2169
01:19:50,740 --> 01:19:51,880
You are the 2019 Wiener Dog champion.

2170
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,060
The fucking B.M.

2171
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:55,400
He looked at him before he zoomed.

2172
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:56,520
He's walking away a wiener.

2173
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,020
Woo, Han Solo.

2174
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,480
Wait, I need to see that.

2175
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,300
Give me that in slow-mo.

2176
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,400
I need to see that in slow-mo, guys.

2177
01:20:10,060 --> 01:20:10,720
Look at him.

2178
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:12,480
Oh, my.

2179
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:13,120

01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:17,740
Look at him.

2184
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,160
Look at that B.M.

2185
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,100
On your right, grandpa.

2186
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:27,060
He may be short on legs.

2187
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:28,740
The disrespect.

2188
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:32,020
He did the Luigi stare.

2189
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:37,280
Dustin, that's my goat right there.

2190
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:45,180
Not even close.

2191
01:20:46,060 --> 01:20:49,800
But like I said, like, I told you guys, I'm not surprised that this blew up.

2192
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:52,560
The horse king blew up in the normie sphere.

2193
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:59,180
All Americans love is just watching, just watching, like, animals race each other.

2194
01:20:59,520 --> 01:20:59,680
Oh, my.

2195
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:00,340
Here's another one.

2196
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,820
I ordered 200 handforged.

2197
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:02,840
Okay, that's an ad.

2198
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:04,780
He ordered 200.

2199
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:05,300
What?

2200
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:07,800
He ordered 200 knives.

2201
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:09,160
That's his ad.

2202
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:09,940
Oh, my God.

2203
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:11,020
Okay, this is an...

2204
01:21:11,020 --> 01:21:14,560
Okay, this is an actual professional wiener dog race.

2205
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:15,140
Look at this.

2206
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:16,940
The wiener dog...

2207
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:17,900
Up for heat.

2208
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:18,820
Number one.

2209
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,160
Oh, wait.

2210
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:19,740
Sorry.

2211
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:21,620
I still have, like, slow-mo on.

2212
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,880
Like, look at this racetrack.

2213
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,740
Number one is Luna.

2214
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,840
Ooh, Luna.

2215
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:28,740
Luna.

2216
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,240
Good luck, Luna and Shelby Ralston.

2217
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:33,780
Number two.

2218
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:35,180
Oh, forget that.

2219
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:36,780
That's my new O-sheet.

2220
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,600
Luca, thank you for the super chat.

2221
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:38,960
Thank you.

2222
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:39,680
Thank you.

2223
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:41,940
Oh, my God.

2224
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:42,920
The pros.

2225
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,600
This is where the pros go.

2226
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,660
What was it called in the Uma game?

2227
01:21:46,660 --> 01:21:50,480
This is a three-legged wiener dog.

2228
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,620
Oh, my God.

2229
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,580
Named Ringo.

2230
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:54,080
You go, Ringo.

2231
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:55,720
You don't need...

2232
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,380
Ringo with three legs.

2233
01:21:57,680 --> 01:21:58,340
Don't doubt him.

2234
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:00,800
You go, Ringo.

2235
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:01,660
Number four.

2236
01:22:01,780 --> 01:22:02,520
You got this.

2237
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,500
Mr. Boss Longbody.

2238
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,400
Mr. Boss Longbody.

2239
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,540
Ringo, my God.

2240
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:13,940
And number five.

2241
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:14,260
Number five.

2242
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:17,700
This is Rusty.

2243
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,080
Oh, my God.

2244
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:20,240
He's extra chunky.

2245
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,200
Yeah, Rusty.

2246
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,400
Yay, Rusty.

2247
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,900
Yeah, three legs.

2248
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,160
He's less the way to slow him down.

2249
01:22:29,460 --> 01:22:30,080
That's true.

2250
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:32,140
Where's Winnie?

2251
01:22:32,540 --> 01:22:33,900
Oh, my God.

2252
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:34,520
Wait, he's...

2253
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:35,060
Oh, my God.

2254
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:36,780
Look how buff Winnie is.

2255
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,200
That's a fucking muscle.

2256
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:42,380
This one goes by the name of Opus.

2257
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:45,180
Oh, he's cute.

2258
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,140
He's a...

2259
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:46,880
My man Otis.

2260
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:47,860
My man.

2261
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:48,800
My...

2262
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:49,180
Yo.

2263
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:50,480
That...

2264
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:50,980
That...

2265
01:22:50,980 --> 01:22:51,300
Bro.

2266
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:53,980
My dog is missing a fucking leg.

2267
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,460
This is not me.

2268
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,580
Look at that.

2269
01:22:58,740 --> 01:23:00,180
Bro, she's running in that dress?

2270
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:02,660
Bro, what about Aerodynamic?

2271
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:05,320
It's gonna slow you down, Winston.

2272
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:06,520
And number nine is Vinnie.

2273
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:08,080
Oh, wait.

2274
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:08,900
They all have dresses.

2275
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:09,460
Never mind.

2276
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:10,120
They all...

2277
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:14,760
Rounding out heat number one.

2278
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:17,000
They all have little dresses.

2279
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:17,640
Never mind.

2280
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:18,040
It's fair.

2281
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,700
She is Millie.

2282
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:21,400
Hello, Millie.

2283
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:22,740
Oh, she's old.

2284
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:24,820
Line up for heat number one.

2285
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,100
All right.

2286
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:28,160
Are they racing?

2287
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:29,160
Are they...

2288
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:30,560
When does the race start?

2289
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,560
Okay, we're gonna skip to the races now.

2290
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,280
And now have a line up for heat number two.

2291
01:23:34,280 --> 01:23:35,640
We don't care about heat two.

2292
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,060
Oh my god.

2293
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:37,920
Bro, what?

2294
01:23:39,780 --> 01:23:41,380
This is where they're running.

2295
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:42,520
Holy...

2296
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,540
This is so professional.

2297
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,180
She's the dog from Cars 1.

2298
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,620
There's like 10 dogs or something.

2299
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,580
Oh, they're ready.

2300
01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:59,420
They're fucking ready, ready.

2301
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:03,640
That's a pro horse, bro.

2302
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:08,740
This is professional right there.

2303
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,180
One dog's trying to walk away.

2304
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,520
I see you.

2305
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,400
Ladies and gentlemen.

2306
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,280
The wieners are in their spots.

2307
01:24:18,700 --> 01:24:19,940
Oh, they're there.

2308
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:20,800
Go!

2309
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,020
Here come the wieners.

2310
01:24:23,120 --> 01:24:25,320
They shoot out of there straight and strong.

2311
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,900
Mr. Boss Longbody gallops along nicely.

2312
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:29,780
Car crash!

2313
01:24:29,780 --> 01:24:30,420
Car crash!

2314
01:24:30,780 --> 01:24:33,260
Oh my god, she's so fast!

2315
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:36,080
That is one fast wiener!

2316
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:37,240
Oh my god!

2317
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,620
That was so...

2318
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,440
The momentum!

2319
01:24:40,820 --> 01:24:42,080
Top three advanced!

2320
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,000
They're just like, oh, we're out here now.

2321
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:47,160
These precious little puppies.

2322
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:47,880
Look at them go.

2323
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,540
Number eight, Winston.

2324
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:50,820
Look at this.

2325
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:51,940
Don't wait, what?

2326
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:53,200
Stop, wait!

2327
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,380
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2328
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:55,680
No, no, no.

2329
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:56,820
You guys gotta see this.

2330
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:58,200
You guys gotta see it.

2331
01:24:58,480 --> 01:24:59,960
We got distracted.

2332
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:01,580
Wait, wait, wait, okay.

2333
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,400
Okay, watch this.

2334
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,100
It's scary!

2335
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:11,660
Wait, what the fuck happened?

2336
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,080
Are you right here?

2337
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:16,420
Let's just say this is the monster.

2338
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:18,920
What are you doing?

2339
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,200
Oh my god!

2340
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,940
Holy cow, what a fast wiener.

2341
01:25:24,940 --> 01:25:27,320
That chat the final is these lots.

2342
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:31,320
Just there for a good time.

2343
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:34,780
Luna, let's go, Luna!

2344
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:35,360
Pass away!

2345
01:25:35,620 --> 01:25:37,620
Wasn't she the one with the fucking muscles?

2346
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:42,060
Okay, bro, look at that, look at that muscle.

2347
01:25:45,480 --> 01:25:47,060
Bro, no, that was the dog.

2348
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:48,520
That was buff as hell.

2349
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,740
Bro, she's jacked.

2350
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:56,560
Did you see those muscles there?

2351
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,600
That shit was jacked.

2352
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,020
All right, let's watch the second race.

2353
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:03,960
We don't know who they are, but they seem really cute.

2354
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,580
Luna is jacked as hell.

2355
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,640
Wait, he's mixed.

2356
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,400
Excuse me.

2357
01:26:13,380 --> 01:26:16,240
I thought this was a wiener dog only.

2358
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:20,800
That's not a full purebred wiener.

2359
01:26:22,100 --> 01:26:23,780
Where's your certificate?

2360
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:28,820
I need to see your birth certificate.

2361
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:30,500
Imposter!

2362
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:31,820
I wrecked...

2363
01:26:31,820 --> 01:26:32,440
Oh, shit!

2364
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:34,420
You can't...

2365
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:37,540
That's a weenie that's mixed up with a chihuahua.

2366
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:40,420
That's a chihuahua weenie.

2367
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,240
I need number two.

2368
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:42,800
Weenie papers!

2369
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:51,960
Instruction's unclear.

2370
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,340
Instruction's unclear.

2371
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:58,580
Oliver, no!

2372
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:00,640
Whoa!

2373
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:01,440
Run!

2374
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:02,600
It's so fast!

2375
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:03,200
Oh!

2376
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:03,980
She got it!

2377
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,600
Fluffy wiener is so...

2378
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,660
I mean, they're just out...

2379
01:27:08,660 --> 01:27:10,300
So the wienies just one of...

2380
01:27:10,420 --> 01:27:11,840
Hey, Oliver, you silly!

2381
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,540
What happened?

2382
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,180
He's getting us!

2383
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,160
Look at Oliver, this fluffy little wiener, sir!

2384
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:23,940
What's he eating?

2385
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,600
What is Oliver eating?

2386
01:27:26,180 --> 01:27:28,340
And they're fudgey up for a sunday stroll.

2387
01:27:31,700 --> 01:27:34,980
Oliver, what did you eat?

2388
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:37,400
We'll take a look at the video here.

2389
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:40,820
He's eating, bro!

2390
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,500
Oliver is a special one.

2391
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:45,700
He's very special.

2392
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,760
Oliver came out and had no desire to run.

2393
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,840
But now, here's Jasmine!

2394
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,860
Bro, it's just...

2395
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:57,080
He's a special little dog, okay?

2396
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,400
He went and wrapped backwards!

2397
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,980
We'll see y'all on Labor Day!

2398
01:28:05,180 --> 01:28:06,840
What is this slow-mo for?

2399
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,340
Oh, right here.

2400
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:09,540
Holy shit!

2401
01:28:10,060 --> 01:28:10,360
What?

2402
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:11,520
That's not a wiener!

2403
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,140
I didn't see his papers!

2404
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:14,260
What the fuck?

2405
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,540
Now that's a purebred wiener, though!

2406
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:17,820
That's right!

2407
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,660
Show that half-read what's it about!

2408
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,820
That's right!

2409
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,940
I recognize my wienies!

2410
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,220
Don't you stop!

2411
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:36,400
That's a joke!

2412
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:41,300
DNA, check that dog right now!

2413
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:42,440
Um, excuse me!

2414
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,540
It says wiener dog races!

2415
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:46,620
This is Ola!

2416
01:28:50,720 --> 01:28:51,500
Oh, shit.

2417
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:52,120
Safeway!

2418
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:53,120
Hey, well...

2419
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:55,120
Look at the Safeway!

2420
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:56,820
We got ads!

2421
01:28:58,100 --> 01:28:58,580
Um...

2422
01:28:58,580 --> 01:28:59,000
All right.

2423
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:00,460
Okay, now we watch...

2424
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:00,700
All right.

2425
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,140
I wanted to show you guys this.

2426
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:07,300
Look at this.

2427
01:29:08,020 --> 01:29:09,300
Known as the Oval.

2428
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,160
This will completely change the sport we know it.

2429
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:12,020
The Oval Circus.

2430
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:12,900
The League.

2431
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:13,280
Watch!

2432
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:13,680
Look at this!

2433
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:15,940
This is the League of Pigs.

2434
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,400
There is an actual league.

2435
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:28,820
There's a pig league right now.

2436
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:32,540
Let him go.

2437
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:36,080
I actually watched pig races, like, in real life.

2438
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,600
There's like a fair here in my city.

2439
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:44,080
And, like, they like to... during the summer, they like...

2440
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:45,940
Season 10?!

2441
01:29:45,940 --> 01:29:48,920
What do you mean season 10?!

2442
01:29:48,920 --> 01:29:50,900
But, um...

2443
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:51,840
During...

2444
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:58,680
During, like, summer, they would host, like, pig races and stuff.

2445
01:29:58,740 --> 01:29:59,380
And I've seen one.

2446
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:08,760
Yeah, they love... yeah, county fairs love doing these things.

2447
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,560
All right, we don't care about this.

2448
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:11,700
I'm here for the races.

2449
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:14,900
All right, here we go.

2450
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:21,960
The Henry Cup?!

2451
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:25,180
Piggy S'mores!

2452
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:30,360
All right, race one.

2453
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:33,160
This does not look promising as Piggy S'mores is on top of the box.

2454
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:37,420
And things go from bad to worse as Hoshi decides he's gonna improvise rather than get on...

2455
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,820
Oh my god, he's off track!

2456
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,100
Hoshi is off track!

2457
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:42,760
How is he gonna get back in?!

2458
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:46,140
But she is receiving pressure from Ginger, and now Piggy S'mores is attacking on the inside.

2459
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:49,580
And as they go around the tree, Piggy S'mores has stolen the lead off Bear.

2460
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:52,000
Bear now struggling to fend off Ginger and Piggy S'mores.

2461
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,200
Piggy S'mores must get the win, surely, but Ginger's attacking for second.

2462
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,360
Oh my god, Ginger's so close!

2463
01:30:56,360 --> 01:31:00,460
You can see already, it's very difficult to get a clear view of the finish line from the main camera.

2464
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,420
The loser becomes S'mores.

2465
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,420
Where would I get my pig girl races?!

2466
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,580
Why are we stopping at horse girls?!

2467
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,000
Make all the animals!

2468
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:13,220
I want spinoffs!

2469
01:31:13,620 --> 01:31:19,340
I want my spinoff games!

2470
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:25,740
I yet to spread that the large delay for Hoshi and receiving food is all the convincing he'll need to stay in trouble.

2471
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:27,560
I want my puta musume!

2472
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:29,880
I want my puta musume!

2473
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,100
I want my puta musume!

2474
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,240
Pig racing is serious business!

2475
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:37,220
And that meant that pigs were able to get much further into the wood than they were last season.

2476
01:31:37,460 --> 01:31:40,000
A fact that certainly not lost on the five pigs.

2477
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:40,960
I'm making it all!

2478
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,660
And they almost instantly adapted to foraging.

2479
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:46,380
There's a pig racing game I'm all in!

2480
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:47,360
I'm in it!

2481
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,100
I'm in it!

2482
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:49,860
Piggy S'mores!

2483
01:31:51,860 --> 01:31:54,960
Can we watch snail races next?!

2484
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:57,540
Gary, thank you for the super chat!

2485
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:57,980
Thank you!

2486
01:31:58,200 --> 01:31:58,560
Thank you!

2487
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:00,220
Alright.

2488
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,800
Alright, here we go.

2489
01:32:01,980 --> 01:32:02,180
Let's do it.

2490
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,100
Let's look at the next one.

2491
01:32:03,340 --> 01:32:04,800
What the life of a pig actually looks like.

2492
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,080
Oh, race two!

2493
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:12,600
The first downhill race of the oval track has Hoshi and Bear leading at Hoshi pokes his nose in front.

2494
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,900
And there's a good corner there.

2495
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:18,260
But Piggy S'mores does an exceptional corner there as he overtakes Peppa and now he overtakes Ginger.

2496
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,320
Oh my god, you go, Piggy S'mores!

2497
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,080
Go, Piggy S'mores!

2498
01:32:22,240 --> 01:32:22,760
Come on!

2499
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,160
Oh my god, he's ketchup!

2500
01:32:24,520 --> 01:32:25,300
He's hitting his ult!

2501
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,100
He's ulting!

2502
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:27,700
He's ulting!

2503
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:28,960
Oh!

2504
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:31,480
Oh, it was a close race!

2505
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,380
Yo, there's a dog swimming...

2506
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:36,890
Wait, there's a dog swimming race?!

2507
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:38,710
Alright, guys, we're just...

2508
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:39,580
Alright.

2509
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:42,120
Dog swimming race.

2510
01:32:42,340 --> 01:32:42,760
Okay, I...

2511
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:43,600
This I gotta see.

2512
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:44,580
I...

2513
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:47,360
What the...

2514
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,020
There's no way...

2515
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:49,840
This has to be...

2516
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:50,520
Okay, that's AI.

2517
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:51,480
Okay, thank god.

2518
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,870
Okay, I was gonna say...

2519
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:53,980
That has...

2520
01:32:53,980 --> 01:32:54,520
There is...

2521
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,160
Incredible Dog Diving National Championship.

2522
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:58,720
Alright.

2523
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:00,660
Alright, what is this?

2524
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,720
Karina Farms in the National Championship Finals.

2525
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:08,300
And right there, you're looking at the best in the business in diving dogs.

2526
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:11,160
Look, we're talking about racing, right?

2527
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:12,500
This is on topic!

2528
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,960
Incredible dog challenge record holders, but this stacked field is finally...

2529
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:17,900
This is...

2530
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:19,060
This is priority.

2531
01:33:19,820 --> 01:33:20,980
They're in the lead with a 34...

2532
01:33:20,980 --> 01:33:23,260
I didn't know about this dog diving.

2533
01:33:23,260 --> 01:33:24,180
any shit?

2534
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,920
Oh my god!

2535
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:35,880
This is just 1.8 million views?

2536
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,280
I have not heard about this.

2537
01:33:42,260 --> 01:33:44,260
What the fuck?!

2538
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:47,800
Holy shit!

2539
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,560
Bro, this is like the long jumper in the water.

2540
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,620
Oh my god, look at him go, he's flying!

2541
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:02,000
This is like the... what was it called?

2542
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,980
The key and peel sketch?

2543
01:34:04,540 --> 01:34:06,720
With the football graphics.

2544
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,040
The air tie.

2545
01:34:11,420 --> 01:34:11,700
Wow!

2546
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,320
The propeller tail!

2547
01:34:15,780 --> 01:34:17,480
The dog actual blast.

2548
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,240
Oh my god, look at him!

2549
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:27,800
Oh my god, it's a helicopter tail!

2550
01:34:28,220 --> 01:34:29,520
Oh, the slow mode!

2551
01:34:30,100 --> 01:34:31,700
Holy shit, the slow mode!

2552
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:39,780
If I keep slow mode on his face, he's actually using his tail for more air time.

2553
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:40,840
That's crazy.

2554
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:42,620
The strats are insane.

2555
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:45,960
When his dad is never jumping again, guys.

2556
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:48,300
Roy, thank you for the super chat.

2557
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,160
Thank you, thank you.

2558
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:50,900
Not after the accident.

2559
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,420
Oh, he got it though!

2560
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,700
Oh my god, the best of the best, guys.

2561
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:05,400
With 32 feet, Shleen, that's unheard of that 32 feet is in fifth place this year.

2562
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:07,400
Wait, 32 feet?

2563
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:09,240
Who's first?

2564
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,660
It's 50 feet long?

2565
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:15,780
Why?

2566
01:35:16,540 --> 01:35:18,160
Okay, we're going to the most play.

2567
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:19,100
Clearly, that guy.

2568
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:19,980
We gotta see the winner.

2569
01:35:20,280 --> 01:35:25,800
They won our Dallas-Fort Worth Central Regionals earning a spot here to the National Championship Finals.

2570
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:30,580
It was so close, guys.

2571
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:34,520
It was so... alright, this is apparently the most viewed.

2572
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,900
We have been coming to the Purina Incredible Dog Tour.

2573
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:39,660
Oh my god, it's American Idol, like, sad story time.

2574
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:41,540
And it is the highlight of our year.

2575
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:44,240
The biggest jump for Sounders.

2576
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:46,000
What the fuck?

2577
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,740
I think he might have just broken that.

2578
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,320
36 feet.

2579
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,380
A brand new world record.

2580
01:35:52,860 --> 01:35:54,200
Where is he?

2581
01:35:54,980 --> 01:35:55,420
What?

2582
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:56,160
What?

2583
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:58,620
He's turned eight this year, so...

2584
01:35:58,620 --> 01:35:59,380
Bro, he's eight?

2585
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:00,380
I see the dogs jumping.

2586
01:36:00,540 --> 01:36:01,480
There's some great dogs.

2587
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:04,420
He's got some puppies of his and some...

2588
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:06,620
Bro, how old is that in, like, human age?

2589
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:10,280
And, uh, so I fully expect to be beaten by one of those.

2590
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,900
Incognito, he's two years old.

2591
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,260
He's gonna be three in December.

2592
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:16,060
And he is a Sounders grandson.

2593
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,600
You know, it's really fun to...

2594
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,940
Oh my god, he's gonna...

2595
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:21,440
He's gonna, like, um...

2596
01:36:21,440 --> 01:36:22,220
Take...

2597
01:36:22,220 --> 01:36:23,740
You're going down, old man.

2598
01:36:23,740 --> 01:36:25,560
I'm gonna overtake your legacy.

2599
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:29,340
Bro, that guy is 56 and he's still doing it.

2600
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,480
LeBron, watch out.

2601
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,380
Up and coming.

2602
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:50,580
The future is now, old man.

2603
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:54,020
He does it for the love of the game.

2604
01:36:54,160 --> 01:36:55,600
He has the potential to jump as far as Sounders for sure.

2605
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:57,700
Um, whether or not we'll see that.

2606
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:59,660
Um, we'll just have to wait and see.

2607
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,400
I wanna see him jump!

2608
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:04,100
Great, but it's really about the experience here.

2609
01:37:04,420 --> 01:37:05,100
It's just about...

2610
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:06,780
Time to retire, Grandpa.

2611
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:08,040
It's like a beautiful facility.

2612
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:11,060
And everybody does everything to make sure everything is so...

2613
01:37:11,060 --> 01:37:12,840
Safe and wonderful, then, for them.

2614
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,280
And giving us a bigger pool.

2615
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:16,860
Alright, here we go.

2616
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,280
A bigger pool!

2617
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:18,940
Alright!

2618
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,100
Alright, Grandpa!

2619
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,480
Show us how it's done!

2620
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,140
Oh, he's ready.

2621
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:27,940
He's ready.

2622
01:37:28,700 --> 01:37:29,040
He's ready.

2623
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:29,720
He's like...

2624
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,880
This is it.

2625
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:34,440
I grew up in this sport, kid.

2626
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,860
Ha ha ha ha!

2627
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,040
Ha ha ha ha!

2628
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:39,160
Ha ha ha!

2629
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:39,680
Ha ha ha!

2630
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:40,040
Ha ha ha!

2631
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:46,420
Ha ha ha!

2632
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:49,340
30...

2633
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,800
Okay, 34 is pretty good.

2634
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,000
For an old man.

2635
01:37:52,760 --> 01:37:53,380
30 feet 11 inches.

2636
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:54,980
Wait, he's first?!

2637
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,620
Oh my god.

2638
01:38:02,640 --> 01:38:04,420
He's still first!

2639
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:06,800
And he's 54 years old!

2640
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,080
Grandpa still got it.

2641
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:12,620
Ha ha ha!

2642
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,140
Grandpa still got it!

2643
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:15,180
Ha ha ha!

2644
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,360
Ha ha ha!

2645
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,900
Grandpa still got it!

2646
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:20,740
Ha ha ha!

2647
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:25,480
He's literally LeBron, Tom and Tom, I'm Brady.

2648
01:38:25,780 --> 01:38:26,940
Oh, it's the child.

2649
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,920
Oh, it's the child's turn.

2650
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:30,900
He's like, don't wait, dad.

2651
01:38:31,060 --> 01:38:31,740
I'll show you.

2652
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:39,020
He's not retiring anytime soon, kid.

2653
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:46,120
Oh.

2654
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:54,140
Keep training, kid.

2655
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:56,040
Keep training.

2656
01:39:08,140 --> 01:39:10,780
The kid's got heart, though.

2657
01:39:11,080 --> 01:39:12,780
The kid's got heart.

2658
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:15,540
We were so off topic.

2659
01:39:15,980 --> 01:39:18,420
Put him in the range, kid.

2660
01:39:18,740 --> 01:39:21,420
Your old man still has years in him.

2661
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:32,120
Not rubbing it in his face, but it really is.

2662
01:39:32,860 --> 01:39:34,180
Bronny James.

2663
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:39,080
He went down a tricky rabbit hole.

2664
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,120
It's like me showing you guys.

2665
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:42,900
Look at the video on my phone right now.

2666
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:53,640
Yeah, I'm pretty sure this stream is going to be demonetized by the pig leagues.

2667
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,720
The pig leagues are going to get me.

2668
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,440
I think it was a good time to call it here.

2669
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:04,320
I'm going to...

2670
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:04,740
You know what?

2671
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,060
I have some time, though.

2672
01:40:06,340 --> 01:40:06,720
You know what?

2673
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,200
Before we do call it...

2674
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,260
Let's bring back something.

2675
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:12,420
Let's bring it back.

2676
01:40:13,180 --> 01:40:15,800
It's super chat reading time!

2677
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:17,140
Yay!

2678
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,260
Oh my gosh, it's been so long.

2679
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,920
I've not done super chat reading.

2680
01:40:21,140 --> 01:40:21,820
But that was fun.

2681
01:40:22,100 --> 01:40:22,860
I had...

2682
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:25,900
The pig leagues.

2683
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:26,940
They're going to get me.

2684
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,580
Because I watched their...

2685
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:31,020
I watched their videos without permission.

2686
01:40:31,780 --> 01:40:34,220
All right, let me put up the...

2687
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:36,120
Donation reading time.

2688
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:37,160
God, it's been so long.

2689
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:40,440
It's been so long since we've done this.

2690
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,360
All right, let's put that chat back, too.

2691
01:40:45,780 --> 01:40:46,800
But this was fun.

2692
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:49,000
I had a fun time hanging out with everybody today.

2693
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:50,340
Let's see.

2694
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:53,180
For those who don't know, by the way, my merch is out right now.

2695
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:53,720
So yeah!

2696
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:54,760
Buy my merch!

2697
01:40:54,920 --> 01:40:55,960
It really means a lot.

2698
01:40:56,660 --> 01:40:58,020
I'm not sure when...

2699
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:00,700
If there is going to be a limited order period for any of them yet.

2700
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:03,060
But they'll let me know later on.

2701
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,340
Especially for the birthday merch.

2702
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:05,600
Most likely.

2703
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:06,840
Maybe...

2704
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:07,220
I don't know.

2705
01:41:07,340 --> 01:41:07,860
I don't know yet.

2706
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:08,440
So yeah!

2707
01:41:08,720 --> 01:41:10,800
Please, it's a great way to support me.

2708
01:41:11,180 --> 01:41:13,720
Like I said, other ways to support...

2709
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,900
Merch is another great way to support me.

2710
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:17,060
So yeah!

2711
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:20,200
And there's a lot of really cool stuff there for you to try.

2712
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:22,480
All right, enough show time.

2713
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:24,100
Now it's super chat reading time.

2714
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:25,700
Because I don't know which one I haven't read yet.

2715
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:29,240
Uh...

2716
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:31,200
Orbiton!

2717
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:32,060
Thank you for the super chat!

2718
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:32,740
Thank you, thank you!

2719
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:37,360
Next time you play fetch with dad in a big field, motivate him with the glue factory!

2720
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:38,840
Thank you for the super chat!

2721
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:39,560
Thank you, thank you!

2722
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:41,080
Dogs don't...

2723
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:44,400
Dogs don't make good glue, guys.

2724
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:46,760
Luca, thank you for the Akasupa.

2725
01:41:47,060 --> 01:41:47,300
Thank you.

2726
01:41:47,420 --> 01:41:48,020
Thank you.

2727
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:49,180
VTuber move.

2728
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,660
I'm trying to watch the dogs.

2729
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:55,740
Shush VTubers.

2730
01:41:56,020 --> 01:41:58,360
I'm trying to bet on these dogs right now.

2731
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,640
Oh no.

2732
01:42:03,960 --> 01:42:08,360
I need to refresh my super chat stuff so I can see the super chat.

2733
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:12,060
All right, where was I in super chat reading?

2734
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,580
Marshall and NCG!

2735
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:23,660
Okay, you both said the same thing but Haru actually won a race recently and got one win post retirement.

2736
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:24,480
Good for her.

2737
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:25,400
Yeah, I saw that too.

2738
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:35,240
Like I said, I think the most interesting part about the horse racing game was just a real actual lore from the actual horses themselves.

2739
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:37,100
So, like, that's what was interesting.

2740
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:38,540
Like, not the actual horse girls.

2741
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:39,000
I'm sorry.

2742
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:46,360
I think the real Laura was, like, much more, like, um, cool.

2743
01:42:46,700 --> 01:42:48,200
Like, more cool to read about.

2744
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:53,010
Yeah.

2745
01:42:53,350 --> 01:42:56,330
But it was nice to see, like, the attention to detail and stuff.

2746
01:42:56,630 --> 01:43:08,170
Um, I heard, like, if you go to Japan, uh, go to Japan, there's, like, several restaurants and, like, bars and stuff that are, like, dedicated to, like, specific horses.

2747
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:11,630
Like, apparently, there is, like, a huge horse fandom.

2748
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:18,150
Before, like, the horse girl game ever came out, um, the horses already had their own fandoms and stuff.

2749
01:43:18,290 --> 01:43:23,090
So, like, um, they just, like, you know, it was, like, um, it was just, like, another...

2750
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:26,050
It was a big thing before the game even came out in general.

2751
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:27,750
Yeah, it's massive in Japan.

2752
01:43:28,050 --> 01:43:35,250
And apparently, like, I think, you know, it's getting banned in America because, like, um, um, animal rights is not great.

2753
01:43:36,230 --> 01:43:47,150
When it comes to horse racing, honey, um, the animal rights in America for horse racing is not great.

2754
01:43:47,730 --> 01:43:51,590
Uh, so, that's why it's slowly getting banned in America.

2755
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:53,530
So, that's why I say I'm not surprised.

2756
01:43:53,990 --> 01:44:02,330
Um, I'm not surprised that, like, um, um, that it's blowing up in the normie sphere.

2757
01:44:02,330 --> 01:44:07,150
Um, in America, only because, like, you know, it's a legal way to...

2758
01:44:08,190 --> 01:44:09,350
It's more legal.

2759
01:44:11,630 --> 01:44:14,130
To replicate the feeling of horse racing.

2760
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:16,310
Uh, Raven, thank you for the super chat.

2761
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:17,410
Thank you, thank you.

2762
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:20,650
Um, let's see.

2763
01:44:20,910 --> 01:44:22,750
What else I'm saying is...

2764
01:44:24,590 --> 01:44:25,030
Uh...

2765
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:28,150
Papa Smurf, thank you for the super chat.

2766
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:29,270
Thank you, thank you.

2767
01:44:29,270 --> 01:44:31,250
Goldship's rider didn't pray for him to win.

2768
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:33,310
He prayed for him to be normal.

2769
01:44:34,610 --> 01:44:38,610
Um, I know, like, dog racing is also, like...

2770
01:44:38,610 --> 01:44:45,110
Like, the greyhound racing is also slowly, like, um, getting banned and, like, being, like, uh...

2771
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:53,890
Like, slowly getting banned and not being as popular anymore because of, like, the rules and laws when it comes to, like, breeding for greyhounds for it as well.

2772
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:58,730
Um, but, like, wiener dog racing is fine because it's just, like, the fuck around, you know?

2773
01:45:00,950 --> 01:45:01,350
It's...

2774
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:02,710
Wiener dog racing is fine.

2775
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:05,710
Yeah, greyhounds are, like, not treated the best, too.

2776
01:45:07,430 --> 01:45:09,030
Yeah, they're fucking crazy fast.

2777
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:11,190
Usni!

2778
01:45:11,930 --> 01:45:13,830
Thank you for the super chat.

2779
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:14,910
Thank you, thank you.

2780
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:16,710
Oh, piece of shit.

2781
01:45:16,870 --> 01:45:17,950
Only around that age?

2782
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:21,250
Dango, thank you for the super chat.

2783
01:45:21,370 --> 01:45:22,230
Thank you, thank you.

2784
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:24,330
Uh, Texas is okay.

2785
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:26,730
They have Hank Hill and his propane.

2786
01:45:26,830 --> 01:45:27,610
Thank you for the super chat.

2787
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:28,470
Thank you, thank you.

2788
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:32,590
Um, yeah, wiener dog racing is perhaps not the most competitive.

2789
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:33,990
What of all?

2790
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:35,170
Oh, racing.

2791
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:36,910
It's probably...

2792
01:45:36,910 --> 01:45:38,730
Probably not that competitive.

2793
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:42,730
But when we...

2794
01:45:42,730 --> 01:45:44,150
I mean, we just...

2795
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:44,430
We just...

2796
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:45,270
They just love racing.

2797
01:45:45,490 --> 01:45:45,970
I don't know.

2798
01:45:45,970 --> 01:45:48,630
Racing is just, like, in American's blood.

2799
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:50,810
They just want to know.

2800
01:45:51,130 --> 01:45:51,770
They just want...

2801
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:52,450
I don't know.

2802
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:53,350
It's just, like...

2803
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:56,010
There's just something primal about being the fastest.

2804
01:45:57,730 --> 01:46:02,710
You know, like, in recess, kids would be like, I bet I'm faster than you.

2805
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:04,890
There's just...

2806
01:46:04,890 --> 01:46:06,990
There's just something primal about it.

2807
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:08,410
Hell yeah, brother.

2808
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:10,990
And gambling.

2809
01:46:11,470 --> 01:46:14,550
The love of gambling and racing together.

2810
01:46:16,330 --> 01:46:17,830
We have to know.

2811
01:46:18,090 --> 01:46:19,630
Who is the fastest?

2812
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:22,630
If it wasn't fucked up, I bet you...

2813
01:46:22,630 --> 01:46:23,910
I bet you...

2814
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:26,810
If, like, there were no laws stopping it...

2815
01:46:26,810 --> 01:46:28,290
There's no laws...

2816
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:29,430
In...

2817
01:46:29,430 --> 01:46:31,090
In Pokemon, Batman.

2818
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:33,590
Okay, if there's no laws to stop it...

2819
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:36,710
I bet you America would have invented cheetah racing.

2820
01:46:36,710 --> 01:46:37,630
I...

2821
01:46:40,710 --> 01:46:42,710
If there wasn't any laws...

2822
01:46:43,850 --> 01:46:46,750
Cheetah racing would be 100% a thing.

2823
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:50,850
Um...

2824
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:52,310
Peter, thank you for the super chat.

2825
01:46:52,430 --> 01:46:53,170
Thank you, thank you.

2826
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:54,750
You say that like normal...

2827
01:46:54,750 --> 01:46:56,370
But that sounds sick, though!

2828
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,570
Guys!

2829
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:02,410
Cheetahs are sort of almost endangered.

2830
01:47:02,410 --> 01:47:02,590
Dude!

2831
01:47:04,970 --> 01:47:05,570
Bro!

2832
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:09,270
We had a baby fight club in America!

2833
01:47:09,570 --> 01:47:10,250
Oh my god!

2834
01:47:10,430 --> 01:47:12,550
So many fucked up things happened in America!

2835
01:47:12,970 --> 01:47:13,770
Bro, what the fuck!

2836
01:47:14,110 --> 01:47:19,810
There was a fucking underground baby fight club in America, guys!

2837
01:47:20,110 --> 01:47:21,990
I talked about it before on a collab.

2838
01:47:22,190 --> 01:47:24,010
I don't remember which collab, but...

2839
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:24,630
Um...

2840
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:27,490
A daycare got what, um...

2841
01:47:27,490 --> 01:47:34,290
There was a daycare in America where they were running an illegal baby fight club where people were betting on babies and stuff.

2842
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:36,490
And then they were only found up...

2843
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:42,730
Like, found up because the parents, when they got their babies back, they're like, Why are there bruises and stuff on my baby?

2844
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:44,670
And then the daycare players...

2845
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:45,830
The daycare players...

2846
01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:50,930
The daycare owners were like, Oh yeah, no, your baby just fell down and just had like a bruise.

2847
01:47:50,930 --> 01:47:51,550
Like, just...

2848
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:53,890
They just fell down and like, you know, hurt...

2849
01:47:53,890 --> 01:47:54,650
Like, um...

2850
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:55,950
Got too rough when they were playing.

2851
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:56,950
Um...

2852
01:47:56,950 --> 01:47:58,570
But yeah, no, that shit was crazy.

2853
01:48:03,430 --> 01:48:07,210
You say that like legal baby fight clubs are a thing.

2854
01:48:09,790 --> 01:48:11,390
Never mind, I was joking.

2855
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,110
Don't bring it back.

2856
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:18,530
Um...

2857
01:48:19,130 --> 01:48:19,610
Uh...

2858
01:48:20,210 --> 01:48:20,650
Black...

2859
01:48:20,650 --> 01:48:21,410
Black talent.

2860
01:48:21,510 --> 01:48:22,290
Thank you to the super chat.

2861
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:22,550
Thank you.

2862
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:22,850
Thank you.

2863
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:22,870
Thank you.

2864
01:48:22,930 --> 01:48:23,510
Oh my god.

2865
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:24,450
They did do it.

2866
01:48:24,610 --> 01:48:28,010
They tried doing cheetah racing back in the 50s.

2867
01:48:28,110 --> 01:48:29,170
There's no way that's...

2868
01:48:29,170 --> 01:48:29,930
Oh my god.

2869
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:31,690
I was like, oh my god.

2870
01:48:31,810 --> 01:48:32,450
What would be funny?

2871
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:33,790
But like, I'm pretty sure.

2872
01:48:34,290 --> 01:48:35,810
Like, cheetah racing...

2873
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,730
Uh...

2874
01:48:36,730 --> 01:48:37,170
History.

2875
01:48:37,930 --> 01:48:39,150
There's no way.

2876
01:48:39,410 --> 01:48:41,370
There's no way they actually...

2877
01:48:41,370 --> 01:48:42,510
Real cheetah...

2878
01:48:42,510 --> 01:48:44,650
Cheetah animal racing.

2879
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:45,910
It gives me a car.

2880
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:52,590
12 cheetahs arrived from Kenya in December 1936.

2881
01:48:56,830 --> 01:48:57,450
Alright.

2882
01:48:57,990 --> 01:49:08,210
In December 1936, they bought 12 cheetahs from Kenya to fucking host the goddamn race.

2883
01:49:08,210 --> 01:49:09,030
That's...

2884
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:09,970
Oh my god.

2885
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:11,910
That's...

2886
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:16,490
He planned to stage races featuring both greyhounds and cheetahs.

2887
01:49:16,490 --> 01:49:17,010
Oh my god.

2888
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:18,630
That is a man with a dream.

2889
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,530
Right there.

2890
01:49:20,490 --> 01:49:21,250
Um...

2891
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:27,610
Journalists and politicians were concerned about the treatment of the dogs and the cheetahs.

2892
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:27,810
Yeah.

2893
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:28,530
No.

2894
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:29,450
Oh shit.

2895
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:30,150
Bro.

2896
01:49:31,470 --> 01:49:32,090
Everyone...

2897
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:32,290
They...

2898
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:32,970
This...

2899
01:49:32,970 --> 01:49:33,250
Okay.

2900
01:49:33,910 --> 01:49:34,530
Um...

2901
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,390
This is crazy.

2902
01:49:35,870 --> 01:49:41,590
Although, Dower assured everyone that cheetahs were both trainable and docile.

2903
01:49:42,170 --> 01:49:47,530
This, despite a few attacks that led to two cheetahs being put down.

2904
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:49,350
Guys, don't worry guys.

2905
01:49:49,610 --> 01:49:50,850
They're so trainable.

2906
01:49:51,090 --> 01:49:53,230
We do have to put down two cheetahs though.

2907
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:54,370
But don't worry.

2908
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:55,710
It'll be okay.

2909
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:01,150
Bro.

2910
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:01,890
Okay.

2911
01:50:03,030 --> 01:50:03,370
Oh.

2912
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:06,870
We know now that cheetahs are indeed faster than...

2913
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:07,010
Oh wait.

2914
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:08,930
They're trying to see which one's faster.

2915
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:11,050
The cheetah or...

2916
01:50:11,050 --> 01:50:11,870
Um...

2917
01:50:11,870 --> 01:50:12,390
Uh...

2918
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:12,510
Oh.

2919
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:14,510
Apparently ended because of World War II.

2920
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:14,970
Okay.

2921
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:15,510
That...

2922
01:50:15,510 --> 01:50:15,990
You know what?

2923
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:16,210
That...

2924
01:50:16,210 --> 01:50:16,730
I feel like...

2925
01:50:16,730 --> 01:50:16,830
Yeah.

2926
01:50:16,870 --> 01:50:17,550
There's much...

2927
01:50:17,550 --> 01:50:18,650
There's priorities here.

2928
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:23,670
Because of World War II.

2929
01:50:23,930 --> 01:50:24,330
We managed...

2930
01:50:24,330 --> 01:50:26,890
We managed to stop cheetah racing.

2931
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:28,410
Um...

2932
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:28,750
Oh my...

2933
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:29,230
That tracks.

2934
01:50:29,410 --> 01:50:29,490
Yeah.

2935
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:29,970
That tracks.

2936
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:32,430
Uh...

2937
01:50:32,430 --> 01:50:32,770
Nuka.

2938
01:50:32,770 --> 01:50:34,070
Thank you for the super chat.

2939
01:50:34,190 --> 01:50:34,490
Thank you.

2940
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:35,170
Thank you.

2941
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:36,050
That's what...

2942
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:37,450
That's what ended it!

2943
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,850
Not because of unhumane.

2944
01:50:40,090 --> 01:50:40,690
It was...

2945
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:44,950
Anything else could have stopped it.

2946
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:45,530
You know?

2947
01:50:45,710 --> 01:50:46,790
Like animal rights.

2948
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:47,730
But no.

2949
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:51,190
It's just because they just didn't have enough time because of World War II.

2950
01:50:52,410 --> 01:50:52,630
Uh...

2951
01:50:52,630 --> 01:50:52,890
Luka.

2952
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:54,050
Thank you for the super chat.

2953
01:50:54,170 --> 01:50:54,430
Thank you.

2954
01:50:54,550 --> 01:50:55,050
Thank you.

2955
01:50:55,670 --> 01:50:56,110
Um...

2956
01:50:56,110 --> 01:50:58,750
You're Canadian but you haven't apologized once.

2957
01:50:59,330 --> 01:50:59,610
Johnny.

2958
01:50:59,710 --> 01:51:00,610
Thank you for the super chat.

2959
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:00,950
Thank you.

2960
01:51:01,050 --> 01:51:01,650
Thank you.

2961
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:03,370
I got five on number three.

2962
01:51:03,530 --> 01:51:04,090
Let's go!

2963
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:04,970
Gary.

2964
01:51:05,090 --> 01:51:05,850
Thank you for the super chat.

2965
01:51:05,930 --> 01:51:06,130
Thank you.

2966
01:51:06,250 --> 01:51:06,670
Thank you.

2967
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:07,210
Five.

2968
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:09,730
Um...

2969
01:51:09,730 --> 01:51:10,230
Let's see.

2970
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:11,870
Uh...

2971
01:51:12,630 --> 01:51:14,110
Droom, are youczyć me in the super chat?

2972
01:51:14,230 --> 01:51:14,410
Thank you.

2973
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:17,550
Oh my gosh.

2974
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:20,070
I'm trying to figure out where I am at...

2975
01:51:20,610 --> 01:51:21,930
..in my super chat.

2976
01:51:22,730 --> 01:51:23,130
Gladstone.

2977
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:24,010
I'm thinking about in the super chat.

2978
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,350
Thank you.

2979
01:51:24,850 --> 01:51:28,510
Love how the Doki Suica stream turns out to be the React stream in disguise.

2980
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:30,210
Absolute City Sinema.

2981
01:51:30,650 --> 01:51:31,450
Peak Doki.

2982
01:51:31,590 --> 01:51:32,470
Thank you for the super chat.

2983
01:51:32,590 --> 01:51:33,150
Thank you.

2984
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,750
All I'm saying is like...

2985
01:51:34,750 --> 01:51:36,730
Like, real life can never...

2986
01:51:38,030 --> 01:51:41,310
Can ever replace the anime version.

2987
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:55,210
Unless the only way the anime version can be superior to the real-life scenario is when we get...

2988
01:51:55,210 --> 01:52:01,750
All I want in life is...

2989
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:03,630
Where is it?

2990
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:05,830
I need my pig racing.

2991
01:52:06,570 --> 01:52:09,310
That would be true.

2992
01:52:10,770 --> 01:52:12,030
Thank you for the super chat.

2993
01:52:12,210 --> 01:52:13,110
Thank you, thank you.

2994
01:52:14,410 --> 01:52:16,190
Blake, thank you for the super chat.

2995
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:17,310
Thank you, thank you.

2996
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:19,510
Ostrich racing when...

2997
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:21,770
I'm pretty sure they do have it.

2998
01:52:21,830 --> 01:52:22,950
I'm pretty sure that exists.

2999
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:26,670
Unfortunately, the Americans didn't invent...

3000
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:27,950
Oh my... Wait!

3001
01:52:28,290 --> 01:52:30,390
It's from the same park!

3002
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:37,370
Wait, is this the same park?

3003
01:52:37,530 --> 01:52:38,330
Okay, we're back.

3004
01:52:38,330 --> 01:52:39,330
Okay, I'm sorry.

3005
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:40,270
Give me a sec.

3006
01:52:40,410 --> 01:52:45,050
Oh my god, this is like...

3007
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,910
Wait...

3008
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:49,490
Okay, no, no.

3009
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:53,490
Remember the fucking Canterbury Park?

3010
01:52:53,830 --> 01:52:57,630
It's the same one...

3011
01:52:57,630 --> 01:52:59,150
Before ostriches!

3012
01:52:59,150 --> 01:53:00,310
Oh my god!

3013
01:53:01,350 --> 01:53:02,990
Yeah, it is!

3014
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:07,990
It's the same one before ostriches!

3015
01:53:10,730 --> 01:53:13,110
There's chalkies on it!

3016
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:17,030
What the... There's no way that's real!

3017
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:18,290
There's no...

3018
01:53:19,030 --> 01:53:20,050
AI?

3019
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:24,180
No way!

3020
01:53:30,150 --> 01:53:31,290
It's real!

3021
01:53:31,530 --> 01:53:32,970
It's not even AI!

3022
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:35,350
It's...

3023
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:36,470
It's not even AI!

3024
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:37,850
It's like leaning back and like...

3025
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:38,670
Go back in there!

3026
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:40,830
It is...

3027
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:48,830
It's not even...

3028
01:53:48,830 --> 01:53:49,690
It's 2024!

3029
01:53:49,690 --> 01:53:50,290
It's 2024!

3030
01:53:52,530 --> 01:53:54,930
I can't see this again!

3031
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:56,830
Luca, thank you for the super chat!

3032
01:53:56,970 --> 01:53:57,230
Thank you!

3033
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:57,810
Thank you!

3034
01:53:58,730 --> 01:54:00,010
Oh my god!

3035
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,960
Oh my god, bro!

3036
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:09,760
He's holding on!

3037
01:54:13,200 --> 01:54:15,360
We won't race anything!

3038
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,800
This is 2024!

3039
01:54:18,520 --> 01:54:21,500
Don't let your dreams be dreams guys!

3040
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:24,980
It's the same park where they held the wiener!

3041
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:26,100
Okay!

3042
01:54:26,640 --> 01:54:31,740
The Minnesota Horse Race Track hosted ostrich, camel, and zebra racing!

3043
01:54:31,740 --> 01:54:33,100
Wait!

3044
01:54:33,640 --> 01:54:35,280
Zebra racing?

3045
01:54:36,920 --> 01:54:37,920
Alright.

3046
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:42,240
Alright.

3047
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:47,000
Ostrich racing is true cinema.

3048
01:54:47,660 --> 01:54:50,000
Blake, thank you for the super chat.

3049
01:54:53,860 --> 01:54:55,860
Alexander Camelton!

3050
01:54:57,260 --> 01:55:03,080
Here comes the Sheik and Hubert Humphrey by Hamilton!

3051
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,960
Alexander Camelton!

3052
01:55:07,280 --> 01:55:08,760
Let's go!

3053
01:55:13,550 --> 01:55:16,520
Let's go, Alexander Camelton!

3054
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:28,800
I don't think that's zebras.

3055
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:34,160
He was pouring for this!

3056
01:55:35,840 --> 01:55:37,280
Alright, what's the replay like?

3057
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:41,920
Donald Hump, funny, went to the right out of the gate.

3058
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:43,800
Look at the Sheik.

3059
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:48,940
Raphael Mojica Jr. Riding that camel for everything he has.

3060
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,820
But it's Delgado and Alexander Camelton!

3061
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:54,560
Oh my god!

3062
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:00,200
The leading quarter horse rider just won a quarter horse like this.

3063
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:00,620
Wait.

3064
01:56:02,380 --> 01:56:03,200
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

3065
01:56:03,300 --> 01:56:03,680
Here we go.

3066
01:56:04,140 --> 01:56:05,420
And did it go!

3067
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:24,740
He doesn't care!

3068
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:25,780
He'll keep on going!

3069
01:56:25,820 --> 01:56:27,080
He needs no rider!

3070
01:56:27,860 --> 01:56:29,580
He needs no rider!

3071
01:56:30,200 --> 01:56:32,340
Bird, bird, bird, bird is the word!

3072
01:56:34,220 --> 01:56:35,460
They're so cute!

3073
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:36,260
They're so cute!

3074
01:56:36,260 --> 01:56:36,300
They're so cute!

3075
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:37,940
Okay, I need to see the zebra!

3076
01:56:38,300 --> 01:56:40,800
Hi, they're sort of like horses.

3077
01:56:41,180 --> 01:56:42,120
But like- Ooh, wait.

3078
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:43,800
We don't need plumbing help, guys.

3079
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:48,320
We- Let's- We're fine.

3080
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,280
Excuse me, I'm here for my zebra races right now.

3081
01:56:52,380 --> 01:56:54,120
Alright, here we go.

3082
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:01,860
Guys, I don't think they're...

3083
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:05,640
Oh my god, Jay-Z is going crazy!

3084
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:09,940
They're giving up!

3085
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:10,980
Oh!

3086
01:57:20,240 --> 01:57:21,960
Oh my god!

3087
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:24,420
Oh my god, they still kept the jockey!

3088
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:25,200
He won!

3089
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:28,100
The remaining jockey wins!

3090
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:39,880
He tried to run into the circle to eat the children!

3091
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:41,700
That's so fucked up!

3092
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:47,580
He comes out running this town.

3093
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:49,800
Then it's Zebron James.

3094
01:57:50,380 --> 01:57:52,320
But in the NBA Finals, he quits.

3095
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:54,260
Frankie Johnson down.

3096
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:56,600
Now Jay-Z wants to eat children.

3097
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,620
Shepard gets into Jay-Z.

3098
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:00,540
He's going to win the race easily.

3099
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:02,280
Wait, here comes Zebron James.

3100
01:58:02,380 --> 01:58:03,360
Oh wait, he quit again.

3101
01:58:03,680 --> 01:58:06,520
And now Shepard tries to cross the line and doesn't.

3102
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:08,000
And Justine Klaver wins.

3103
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,860
Oh, he didn't cross the line!

3104
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:12,740
He stopped that right there!

3105
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,100
Here come the zebras into the winner's circle.

3106
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:16,880
I passed this place on my way to the...

3107
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:17,500
Ozzy!

3108
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:17,940
Ozzy!

3109
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:18,820
Are you telling me?

3110
01:58:18,980 --> 01:58:21,200
You missed out on cameras!

3111
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:22,280
Camels!

3112
01:58:22,460 --> 01:58:23,140
Zebra!

3113
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:25,000
And ostrich racing!

3114
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:26,300
I can't believe it!

3115
01:58:26,360 --> 01:58:27,800
You were so close to greatness!

3116
01:58:28,080 --> 01:58:29,720
And you didn't even go!

3117
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,000
I...

3118
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:32,220
You can...

3119
01:58:32,220 --> 01:58:34,640
You could have seen these lines!

3120
01:58:34,640 --> 01:58:35,500
There it is again!

3121
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:36,340
I did!

3122
01:58:36,660 --> 01:58:37,980
I hate myself!

3123
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:39,560
But the zebra said no!

3124
01:58:40,300 --> 01:58:40,500
And Miss...

3125
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:42,940
Miss Klaver just comes cruising in right now!

3126
01:58:43,180 --> 01:58:45,360
Now Zebron James is going to win!

3127
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:47,820
Did I really through them?

3128
01:58:48,360 --> 01:58:49,960
And here comes Miss Klaver with the pink helmet!

3129
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:51,080
Look at that!

3130
01:58:51,320 --> 01:58:53,180
Brilliant camera work by the team!

3131
01:58:53,660 --> 01:58:55,500
He's like, fuck you!

3132
01:58:56,220 --> 01:58:57,440
And Miss Klaver wins!

3133
01:58:57,820 --> 01:58:58,460
Spectacular!

3134
01:58:59,100 --> 01:58:59,580
Pictures!

3135
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:02,280
Pictures!

3136
01:59:02,940 --> 01:59:03,780
What is this?

3137
01:59:03,940 --> 01:59:05,580
Oh, now it's the real horse racing!

3138
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,280
Now...

3139
01:59:06,280 --> 01:59:07,500
We don't care about that!

3140
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:09,640
We're here for the real content!

3141
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,360
Zebra racing is the real content!

3142
01:59:16,980 --> 01:59:17,240
Alright!

3143
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:18,480
Okay!

3144
01:59:18,720 --> 01:59:19,080
JR!

3145
01:59:19,340 --> 01:59:20,840
Thank you for the super chat!

3146
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:21,480
Thank you!

3147
01:59:21,640 --> 01:59:23,380
Who cares about the horses?

3148
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:28,120
After finding out there's zebra racing?

3149
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,640
If you ever mind about animation or using your likeness?

3150
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:38,000
We're recently getting back into 3D animation!

3151
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,080
And I have a bunch of ideas!

3152
01:59:39,260 --> 01:59:40,620
Some including you and the sloppy sisters!

3153
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:41,020
Yes!

3154
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:42,320
I don't mind at all!

3155
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:43,940
Um, I love fan content!

3156
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:56,800
So if you guys want to make any fan content of me, animation game wise or whatever, it's free to- as long as you don't make profit off like, you know, like, um, obviously if you guys want to put like ads or whatever, like monetization ads on your videos,

3157
01:59:56,920 --> 01:59:57,700
that's fine with me!

3158
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:01,080
But as long as you don't like, um, what's it called?

3159
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:04,860
Like, mass-produced stuff like that, that's where like, I'm like, oh, maybe not, you know?

3160
02:00:06,260 --> 02:00:07,260
But no, it's fine!

3161
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:07,720
It's fine!

3162
02:00:07,780 --> 02:00:10,060
If you want to put like ad monetization, it's fine too!

3163
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:11,420
Um, I'm fine with that!

3164
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:13,400
Um, Luke!

3165
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:14,500
Thank you for the super chat!

3166
02:00:14,640 --> 02:00:14,900
Thank you!

3167
02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:15,640
Thank you!

3168
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:21,000
Uh, uh, uh, my favorite thing was man versus beast!

3169
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:23,060
I was so sad they only made two episodes!

3170
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:26,120
Orangutan versus sumo wrestler tug of war!

3171
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:27,240
That was awesome!

3172
02:00:27,580 --> 02:00:27,680
Wait!

3173
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:28,640
That was real!

3174
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:29,900
That sounds sick!

3175
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:31,000
Thank you for the super chat!

3176
02:00:31,140 --> 02:00:31,960
Thank you, thank you!

3177
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:32,700
JL!

3178
02:00:32,820 --> 02:00:33,560
Thank you for the super chat!

3179
02:00:33,700 --> 02:00:34,480
Thank you, thank you!

3180
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:37,260
My kamioshi is just like me, for real, for real!

3181
02:00:37,380 --> 02:00:40,760
Gets sidetracked by any kind of animal videos!

3182
02:00:41,100 --> 02:00:44,260
Okay, but it was like, they were sick animal videos though!

3183
02:00:44,580 --> 02:00:46,440
I was trying to prove that point!

3184
02:00:46,440 --> 02:00:46,540
Okay!

3185
02:00:46,980 --> 02:00:49,000
This was better than any anime game!

3186
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:49,780
This was...

3187
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:54,180
This was so much better!

3188
02:00:56,080 --> 02:00:56,900
Solid Snake!

3189
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:57,860
Thank you for the super chat!

3190
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:58,820
Thank you, thank you!

3191
02:00:59,120 --> 02:01:02,660
If you think of something silly, humans probably may try it!

3192
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:05,080
We act on a wouldn't it be funny principle!

3193
02:01:05,620 --> 02:01:06,580
Thank you for the super chat!

3194
02:01:06,740 --> 02:01:07,640
Thank you, thank you!

3195
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:08,740
Um, true!

3196
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:10,860
I stopped playing the watch!

3197
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:11,640
Luca!

3198
02:01:11,740 --> 02:01:12,520
Thank you for the super chat!

3199
02:01:12,620 --> 02:01:13,420
Thank you, thank you!

3200
02:01:13,580 --> 02:01:14,140
Oh my god!

3201
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:14,700
That's you!

3202
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:16,180
Um, Blake!

3203
02:01:16,400 --> 02:01:17,180
Thank you for the super chat!

3204
02:01:17,280 --> 02:01:17,960
Thank you, thank you!

3205
02:01:18,200 --> 02:01:19,340
Ostrich Racing!

3206
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:20,340
True Cinema!

3207
02:01:21,080 --> 02:01:21,340
Adam!

3208
02:01:21,640 --> 02:01:22,700
Thank you for the super chat!

3209
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,480
Thank you, thank you!

3210
02:01:23,640 --> 02:01:24,500
I'm sorry, Doki!

3211
02:01:24,660 --> 02:01:26,560
I had nice shifts when you had your bday stream!

3212
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,740
And I missed it completely!

3213
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:29,400
Wishing you everything the best!

3214
02:01:29,540 --> 02:01:29,840
Love you!

3215
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:30,280
You're awesome!

3216
02:01:30,420 --> 02:01:30,920
Thank you!

3217
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:31,740
Thank you for the super chat!

3218
02:01:31,820 --> 02:01:32,400
Thank you, thank you!

3219
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:33,100
It's alright!

3220
02:01:33,100 --> 02:01:37,660
It's okay, as long as you're here to support me and hang out with me, that's all that matters.

3221
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:38,120
Adam.

3222
02:01:38,660 --> 02:01:39,820
Uh, YOU're wraith to the super chat.

3223
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:40,540
Thank you thank you.

3224
02:01:40,660 --> 02:01:44,900
While on the topic of weird racing sports, there's a wife-carrying competition.

3225
02:01:44,900 --> 02:01:46,940
It's in fact, A REAL thing now.

3226
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,020
There's a lot of really fucking weird competitions in sports.

3227
02:01:50,180 --> 02:01:51,140
I know there's one!

3228
02:01:52,780 --> 02:01:54,400
Whererr, um, also thinking of the super chat.

3229
02:01:54,540 --> 02:01:55,020
Thank you, thank you.

3230
02:01:55,140 --> 02:02:00,020
There's one that's like a traditional competition where you just throw a giant piece of log.

3231
02:02:00,600 --> 02:02:03,280
It's like whoever... and you have to like hold it upright too.

3232
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:06,320
Like the piece of log is like facing up in the air.

3233
02:02:06,560 --> 02:02:08,860
And it's like whoever can throw it the furthest.

3234
02:02:09,080 --> 02:02:10,440
And it's like a traditional...

3235
02:02:10,900 --> 02:02:14,300
It's like a traditional like... I think like... is it Irish?

3236
02:02:14,500 --> 02:02:15,220
Or is it Scottish?

3237
02:02:15,580 --> 02:02:16,380
I don't remember.

3238
02:02:17,200 --> 02:02:18,980
Is it the caber toss?

3239
02:02:19,080 --> 02:02:19,280
Oh, yeah.

3240
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:20,460
And then there's the cheese wheel.

3241
02:02:20,700 --> 02:02:23,000
I know about the cheese wheel from the meal pet scheme.

3242
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:27,040
But yeah, I think it was one or the... it's one or the other.

3243
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:30,420
Um, and there's one where you have to chase the cheese...

3244
02:02:30,420 --> 02:02:33,340
Um, people have to chase the cheese down a hill.

3245
02:02:33,560 --> 02:02:36,600
And that's also like an old time competition.

3246
02:02:38,740 --> 02:02:39,220
Uh...

3247
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:40,800
Amphibian, thank you to the super chat.

3248
02:02:40,920 --> 02:02:41,740
Thank you, thank you.

3249
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:43,440
Uh...

3250
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:43,820
Alright!

3251
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:45,740
I think that's all the super chats today!

3252
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:46,480
Yay!

3253
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:49,780
We did our first super chat reading after so long!

3254
02:02:50,040 --> 02:02:51,340
I miss doing these.

3255
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:54,220
But now that, you know, I'm less busy now.

3256
02:02:54,220 --> 02:02:56,940
I don't have to worry about like the birthday prep stuff and everything.

3257
02:02:56,940 --> 02:02:59,060
Um, things are like...

3258
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:00,760
The load is lighting up a lot more.

3259
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:02,500
I can finally hang out and talk to you guys.

3260
02:03:02,560 --> 02:03:06,400
I don't have to worry about maintaining my voice anymore for like singing or anything.

3261
02:03:06,640 --> 02:03:09,300
So I'm very happy to be able to do the super chat reading with you guys again.

3262
02:03:09,420 --> 02:03:09,660
Yeah!

3263
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:12,020
Anyway guys, I'm gonna head off now.

3264
02:03:12,120 --> 02:03:13,720
I'm gonna rest before my next stream.

3265
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:16,000
Um, most lately I might push the stream...

3266
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:16,360
Actually, no.

3267
02:03:16,460 --> 02:03:17,540
I'll still keep it at 5pm.

3268
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:19,320
Um...

3269
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:25,000
But at 5pm PST, I will have my last Mecha Break stream, um, on Twitch.

3270
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:26,360
Uh, for Twitch drops.

3271
02:03:26,500 --> 02:03:29,100
So if you guys haven't got your Twitch drops yet, where you can be a cat girl.

3272
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:30,900
Um...

3273
02:03:30,900 --> 02:03:32,020
Today is the last day.

3274
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:33,600
And I'll be doing two hours of that.

3275
02:03:33,840 --> 02:03:34,380
Um, but yes.

3276
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:36,580
As always everybody, stay hydrated.

3277
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:37,220
Posture check.

3278
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:38,000
Get them around.

3279
02:03:38,260 --> 02:03:39,060
Get that blood flowing.

3280
02:03:39,220 --> 02:03:40,180
And if you, stay up for me.

3281
02:03:40,360 --> 02:03:41,080
Head to bed.

3282
02:03:41,200 --> 02:03:42,460
Cause you deserve it!

3283
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,920
I'll see you guys next time everybody!

3284
02:03:44,180 --> 02:03:44,920
Bye guys!

3285
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:45,820
Bye!
