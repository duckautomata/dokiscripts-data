1
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,740
No loop.

2
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,960
No loop.

3
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,200
No loop.

4
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,560
I'm not a person right now.

6
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,840
Oh my god.

7
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,900
Give me a sec.

8
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,960
I'm not a person at the moment.

9
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,280
The 1230 time slot...

10
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,900
is truly the bane of my existence.

11
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:29,230
If we even ever start on time at 1230, like, a miracle just happened.

12
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,760
It's like when Jesus turned water into wine.

13
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,220
That is my miracle.

14
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,930
When I show up on time at 1230.

15
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:53,890
I do it for... I do it for the European dragoons out there.

16
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,350
This is the time slot for you.

17
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,810
Because you don't get much, especially for VTubers.

18
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:10,470
There's not a lot of opportunities to watch NA VTubers at a decent time.

19
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,890
So I do it for you, European dragoons.

20
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:17,490
The EU dragoons out there.

21
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,970
I do it for you.

22
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,750
Give me a sec, guys.

23
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,430
As always, it takes a little bit to rev up the Doki engine.

24
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,290
To start in the day.

25
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,650
So, like, you know how, like, cars in the morning... I know nothing about cars.

26
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,690
But you know how...

27
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,790
You know how cars in the morning, you know, they, like, stutter a bit.

28
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,810
And you gotta be like...

29
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,010
That's me right now.

30
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,510
That's me at the moment.

31
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,150
Also, like, I really wish I could do a lot of shit Dynasty Warriors.

32
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,590
But my throat is still recovering.

33
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,110
And all that shit.

34
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,230
So... and it's cold too.

35
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:04,710
So, like, it wasn't a great night for my throat.

36
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:11,390
I think the one thing I miss the most is just doing, like, long chatting streams after the game.

37
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,570
Which, obviously, I can't do.

38
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:14,830
Because...

39
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,510
Because I have to make sure I don't overdo my throat.

40
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,210
And overdo my voice.

41
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,650
So, like...

42
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,570
So, I'm trying my best to, like...

43
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:27,450
I'm trying my best to, like, pace myself when it comes to streaming.

44
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,550
And everything.

45
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,650
So, by the time... So, my voice will recover.

46
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,570
My voice will recover in time.

47
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,530
Oh my god!

48
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,610
This is for you, EU Kun!

49
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,250
Invictus, thank you for your very first...

50
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,010
I recognize an EU currency when I see one.

51
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,690
I recognize a European currency.

52
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,990
Where are you from?

53
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,150
That's right!

54
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,730
You're using Euros.

55
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,010
This is for you!

56
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,570
Hey, Doki.

57
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,610
First time superchatting.

58
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,370
Love your content.

59
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,210
Keep it up.

60
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,550
Use this wisely.

61
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,530
Oh my god.

62
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,610
Do you know how much a euro is in Canadian?

63
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,290
Euro to CAD.

64
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,850
That's one...

65
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,950
One euro is like 1.56 Canadian.

66
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,110
Oh my god.

67
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,870
I'm 50 cents richer, baby!

68
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,910
Thank you for your very first superchat.

69
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,690
I really...

70
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,890
I really appreciate it, guys.

71
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,050
Thank you so much.

72
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,770
Mac, thank you for your...

73
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,370
Oh my god, another euro!

74
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,750
EU, do you know how much 10 euro is?

75
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,150
I'm 5 dollars richer!

76
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,510
It's 15.56 Canadian!

77
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,150
Oh my god!

78
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,150
This is for you.

79
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,550
Mac, thank you for the superchat.

80
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,550
Thank you, thank you.

81
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,570
Oh my god.

82
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,630
That's enough money to order fast food!

83
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,670
Actually, no.

84
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,130
That's actually a lot more money to order.

85
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,630
Like, actually not fast food.

86
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,610
You know like, how like...

87
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,430
I just realized...

88
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,130
I just realized like...

89
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,750
Oh my god!

90
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,750
Wait, is that a pound sign?

91
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,630
Wait, isn't pound more than euros now?

92
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,370
Let me check.

93
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:13,750
Pound to...

94
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,090
Yeah.

95
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,050
Oh my god!

96
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,250
85 cents more!

97
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,430
Oh my god.

98
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,310
Oh my god, that's 85 cents more.

99
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,750
Oh my god.

100
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,130
Our Canadian dollar is so fucked, guys.

101
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,410
It's like...

102
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,630
Almost every currency in the world is like...

103
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,990
More expensive than Canadian dollars at the moment.

104
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:38,890
So we're like...

105
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,910
Financially, we're not...

106
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,630
Financially, for Canadians...

107
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,710
Our money is sort of like monopoly money at the moment.

108
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,410
And then people in...

109
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,970
People like in Zimbabwe is like...

110
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,650
Am I a joke to you right now?

111
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:55,990
And I'm like, look...

112
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,110
Look, we're considered a...

113
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,130
We're considered a first world country.

114
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,030
And like, things aren't looking great for us at the moment.

115
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,050
We're at...

116
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,330
We're at like...

117
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,930
We're at like a trade war right now.

118
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,190
So like, I'm a little worried.

119
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,530
Because like...

120
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:16,190
I don't know how long this trade war is gonna...

121
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,210
I don't know how long this trade war is gonna be, guys.

122
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,390
So I'm...

123
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,830
I'm a little worried right now.

124
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:31,890
Um...

125
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,030
Mac, thank you for the 5 gifted shits.

126
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,630
Thank you.

127
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,330
Thank you.

128
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:35,910
Okay.

129
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:36,690
Alright.

130
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,330
Okay, so like...

131
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,510
I know I normally don't talk...

132
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,550
I don't talk about politics.

133
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,910
But I need to tell you guys this part.

134
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,510
Because it's so fucking funny.

135
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,670
Um...

136
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,930
Because like...

137
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,270
I got reached out...

138
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,110
By Canadian political party...

139
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,750
To like...

140
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:56,030
If I could be like a...

141
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,430
I could be like a...

142
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,090
Like a guest speaker...

143
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,230
For their party.

144
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,910
And then I was like...

145
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:04,690
When my manager told...

146
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,230
It was a...

147
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,370
I won't say which party.

148
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,010
But they were one of the big ones.

149
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,710
By the way.

150
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:10,230
They were one of the...

151
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,210
They were one of the big Canadian parties.

152
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,570
Because I recognized it.

153
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:13,950
I was like...

154
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,710
Oh my god.

155
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,190
What is this?

156
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:18,230
And then their email was like literally their political party.

157
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,830
And then so like...

158
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,850
My manager was like...

159
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,350
Oh my god.

160
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,250
So I was like...

161
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,650
Okay, we have something funny for you.

162
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,530
Like we have something like really interesting and funny.

163
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,930
And I was like...

164
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,110
Obviously I said no.

165
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,530
I don't want to be like...

166
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,590
I'm non-partisan.

167
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,250
So like...

168
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,530
Like as a content creator.

169
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,690
We have to...

170
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,090
You know.

171
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,590
Well, not have to.

172
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,200
But like...

173
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,790
I'm trying to be non-partisan for Canadian parties.

174
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,290
As a public figure.

175
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,970
As like a content creator.

176
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,050
I'm not trying to say like what.

177
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,170
But like...

178
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,170
For me I am.

179
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,590
But I was like...

180
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,270
Holy shit.

181
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,190
That's...

182
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:57,930
I was like...

183
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,270
Oh my god.

184
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,070
Cause you know.

185
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,170
I know why.

186
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,990
Because they're trying to get young voters.

187
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,490
So it's like...

188
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,490
It's like they're trying to get young voters to vote.

189
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,090
So if I like represent...

190
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,990
If I was like quote on quote their mascot or whatever.

191
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,250
They'll be like...

192
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,750
Guys remember to vote.

193
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,370
You know.

194
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:19,670
Cause it was supposed to be for like an election or some shit.

195
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,390
And I was just like...

196
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,330
What the fuck.

197
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:22,430
I was like...

198
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,890
That's crazy.

199
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:28,790
I was like what a fucking insane opportunity.

200
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,170
Like...

201
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,550
So it's like...

202
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:36,950
They're trying to get the VTuber voters guys.

203
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,550
They're trying to get...

204
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,630
They're trying to get...

205
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,750
They're trying to get the VTuber voters.

206
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,770
Cause we're the young...

207
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,970
We're the young voters.

208
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,610
Doki has the third party account.

209
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,450
I thought that was like...

210
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,710
I thought that was so funny.

211
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,770
Oh my gosh.

212
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,830
VTuber for parliament.

213
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,990
Wouldn't that be fucking insane?

214
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,470
V3, thank you for the super chat.

215
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,310
Thank you, thank you.

216
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,750
Carl, thank you for the super chat.

217
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,490
Thank you, thank you.

218
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,930
Thank you for the super chat.

219
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:14,910
Thank you, thank you.

220
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,090
AZ, thank you for the super chat.

221
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:17,850
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,010
My brother in Christ.

223
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,690
You set the time.

224
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,630
I'm European.

225
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,110
Thank you, thank you for the super chat.

226
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:23,450
Thank you.

227
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,870
Yes, and that's why it's at 12.30.

228
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,990
In the beginning of my...

229
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,810
In the beginning of my career.

230
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,330
When I first chose this time slot.

231
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,850
It wasn't even 12.30.

232
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,770
It was 12pm PST.

233
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,990
And then I was like...

234
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,830
I can't do it.

235
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,710
I don't even know...

236
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,170
I don't even know how long we lasted guys.

237
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,730
For the 12pm slot.

238
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,870
For the 12pm slot, we did not last very long.

239
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,550
And then after that, I was like...

240
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,210
I can't do it.

241
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,750
We needed those...

242
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,370
We needed those 30 minutes.

243
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,610
And then, even now, I'm like...

244
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,090
We gotta do...

245
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,410
We gotta be able to do this.

246
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,670
Because if we push it even more...

247
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,630
It's not even gonna be EU time anymore.

248
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,590
Thank you for the super chat.

249
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,650
Thank you, thank you.

250
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,270
Maddie, thank you for the super chat.

251
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,070
Thank you, thank you.

252
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,410
I know what's wrong with her.

253
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,370
She ain't got no gamer subs in her.

254
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,290
Thank you for the super chat.

255
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,250
Thank you, thank you.

256
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:22,630
Oh my god.

257
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,730
I was like...

258
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,310
I was like...

259
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,310
I'm trying not to drink too much caffeine.

260
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,990
I've actually been like...

261
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,250
I've actually been like...

262
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,610
Trying my best to...

263
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,010
To like, wean myself off of caffeine.

264
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:38,790
Which I've been...

265
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,630
I actually haven't drank caffeine since...

266
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:43,810
The last time I drank gamer subs was for the tournament.

267
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,750
When I was like...

268
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,810
When I didn't sleep.

269
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,730
Because I was so nervous.

270
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,970
The VTuber Rivals tournament.

271
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,650
Because I was like...

272
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,170
Incredibly nervous.

273
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:52,970
And I couldn't sleep.

274
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,610
So I had like...

275
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,990
I think like two hours of sleep for that.

276
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:55,910
But then...

277
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,690
Before that...

278
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,690
I actually haven't drank like...

279
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,910
Any caffeine in a while.

280
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,210
Just because like...

281
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,610
I didn't want to be dependent on caffeine.

282
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,150
Like I...

283
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,970
At one point I was like...

284
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,190
A little bit too dependent on...

285
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,690
On...

286
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,350
On caffeine.

287
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,650
Because I was just tired all the time.

288
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:08,490
And I was like...

289
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,710
Oh, but if I drink caffeine...

290
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,390
I won't be tired.

291
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:11,090
But like...

292
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,150
I'm trying my best.

293
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,990
I am trying my best now.

294
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,150
I'm back to tea and...

295
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,010
I'm back to water.

296
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,390
Because tea also has caffeine.

297
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,350
But I'm back to water.

298
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,450
Anyway...

299
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:19,970
Today...

300
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:20,730
Might not...

301
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:23,130
I know usually I try to make a lot of streams with Dynasty Warriors.

302
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,970
But like...

303
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:25,630
My voice today is not the best.

304
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,170
And also...

305
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,370
I promised Gumi I'd show up for her collab.

306
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,270
Because she wanted me yesterday.

307
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,330
And I was like...

308
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:32,970
Oh...

309
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,710
I thought I was supposed to do a birthday thing with...

310
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,910
Oh, I should wish Elema a happy birthday real quick.

311
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,310
Guys...

312
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:37,590
I...

313
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,170
Give me a sec.

314
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:39,990
Also...

315
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,730
Happy...

316
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,210
Belated...

317
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:41,750
It's okay.

318
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,810
It's okay.

319
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:43,910
Also...

320
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:44,570
Happy...

321
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,470
Belated...

322
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,130
Your birthday.

323
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,110
I was gonna say it on stream.

324
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,650
But...

325
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,530
I forgot.

326
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,650
But here we go.

327
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,390
Okay.

328
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,210
I won't be streaming.

329
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,530
I also told her...

330
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,750
I won't be doing a long stream as well.

331
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,110
Like...

332
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,810
It'll be a...

333
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,250
I told her that like...

334
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:08,510
I won't be staying for too long.

335
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,500
Because, you know, obviously...

336
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,110
Obviously...

337
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,650
Like...

338
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,110
I...

339
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,930
I need a rest.

340
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:14,870
So...

341
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,690
I can't be...

342
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:17,930
I can't be doing long streams...

343
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,730
This week.

344
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,890
I wish I could.

345
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,170
I wish I could.

346
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,890
I might try to go to a hospital tomorrow.

347
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,950
Because like...

348
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:26,450
Dude...

349
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,350
I should be able to trust the cleaners, right?

350
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:31,210
The cleaners aren't gonna take my stuff, right guys?

351
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,270
Tomorrow.

352
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,930
Because I have cleaners coming in tomorrow.

353
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,390
And...

354
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,850
And I'm wondering if like...

355
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,830
Do I need to supervise them?

356
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,150
Or like...

357
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:41,890
They won't take...

358
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,190
What are they gonna take?

359
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:43,590
Like...

360
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,290
All I have is like...

361
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,190
Is like...

362
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,270
Anime stuff.

363
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,910
Merch of me.

364
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,410
And I guess my PC.

365
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,250
The most expensive thing in my...

366
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,630
The most expensive thing in my apartment is literally my PC setup.

367
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,870
So like...

368
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,510
I guess if they have kids, they're like...

369
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,970
She won't notice this.

370
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,290
I guess I should stay.

371
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,290
But like...

372
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:08,830
I don't know.

373
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,350
I don't know if I should supervise.

374
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,130
Or anything.

375
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,610
They're like an actual company.

376
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,410
Yeah, they're a legit business.

377
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,770
So like...

378
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,550
What are they gonna do?

379
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,530
Take my GPU?

380
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,190
Like...

381
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:18,710
Oh my god.

382
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,270
If these...

383
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,670
If these cleaners...

384
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,330
Like...

385
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,270
Brought a set of screwdrivers.

386
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,710
Just so they can rob me of my GPU.

387
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,170
Like...

388
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:27,790
You know what?

389
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,730
They deserve it.

390
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,190
Like...

391
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,450
That is like the biggest con of my life.

392
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
But yeah.

393
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:39,940
I don't know.

394
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,140
I think it'll be fine.

395
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Right?

396
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,880
They're like a legit company.

397
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,460
Okay.

398
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,140
I'll...

399
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,720
Oh, but then if I supervise them.

400
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,460
And then leave.

401
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,500
Then it'll be...

402
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:48,680
Okay.

403
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,940
I never trust strangers in my...

404
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,640
Yeah, but like...

405
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,480
If I talk to them.

406
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:52,840
And like...

407
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,460
Get to know them.

408
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,560
They won't be strangers then.

409
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,300
That's my loophole.

410
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,120
If I get to know them in five minutes.

411
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,020
They can't be strangers no more.

412
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:08,820
Okay.

413
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:09,940
Um...

414
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,300
Anyway.

415
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,220
Um...

416
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:11,400
Alright.

417
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,160
Simple minded.

418
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,280
Simple minded.

419
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,100
Thank you for the super chat.

420
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,400
Thank you.

421
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,880
Thank you.

422
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,700
You're gonna find out your doki bird and steal your clothes and sell them for money.

423
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,000
Thank you for the super chat.

424
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,320
Thank you.

425
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,800
Thank you.

426
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,300
Okay.

427
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,460
That part.

428
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,600
I am a little concerned.

429
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,740
Because like...

430
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,260
I can't really hide my doki bird merch.

431
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,220
Because in my PC room.

432
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,640
It's like...

433
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:31,900
Okay.

434
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,400
I'm just gonna...

435
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,040
I'll take a picture of it.

436
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,200
Okay.

437
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,640
I'm gonna...

438
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,440
I'm gonna like be buffering.

439
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,760
Because when I...

440
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,040
When I turn around.

441
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,240
Um...

442
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,900
I'm gonna be buffering.

443
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,320
When I turn around.

444
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,920
It's literally all doki birds.

445
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,960
Like this is me when I turn around.

446
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,260
And then this is all I see.

447
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,520
And it's just me.

448
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,120
Like it's...

449
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,940
It's literally...

450
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,740
It's literally just me.

451
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,150
So it's like...

452
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,480
Um...

453
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
There's really no hiding who I am.

454
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,500
Uh...

455
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,660
Because I have...

456
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,900
I actually have like a whole shrine.

457
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,040
Just...

458
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:06,600
Of me.

459
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,680
So...

460
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,020
Um...

461
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,500
That's gonna be a big problem in general.

462
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,540
Like...

463
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,580
Oh!

464
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,260
It's me and Sylveon.

465
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,020
By the way.

466
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,020
It's not...

467
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,120
There's a...

468
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,380
There's like a...

469
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,820
There's like a mini shrine of Sylveon.

470
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,440
Right there.

471
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,620
Like in the corner.

472
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,300
Like...

473
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,900
Like Sylveon has like a little special place.

474
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,240
In my shrine.

475
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,980
But it's me and Sylveon.

476
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:35,800
So...

477
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,760
I'm just like...

478
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,120
What do I do in that situation?

479
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,200
Like...

480
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,660
Like they may see like Sylveon.

481
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,240
And be like...

482
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,920
Oh, she likes Sylveon.

483
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,260
And then they're gonna see like...

484
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,960
Whoa, they really like this anime girl.

485
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,140
A lot.

486
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,500
And it's not...

487
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,540
And the shrine isn't even...

488
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,540
I have not finished the shrine by the way.

489
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,020
It is like a huge work.

490
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,260
It's been a work...

491
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,360
Because I think I'm moving...

492
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,500
I might be moving out.

493
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,080
Um...

494
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:07,140
I might be moving out this year.

495
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,000
So like...

496
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,980
I'm just like...

497
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,480
Oh man, I'm not gonna finish it.

498
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,880
So I never finished the shrine.

499
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,040
Just because I...

500
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,360
All I kept thinking about was like...

501
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,160
Maybe I have to...

502
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,940
I might have to move Nick this year.

503
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,880
So I never finished my shrine.

504
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,520
So it's just been...

505
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,440
Okay, so...

506
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,080
Alright, let me...

507
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:24,940
Um...

508
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,160
Okay, let me...

509
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,820
Let me send this over to myself.

510
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,940
So I can show it to you guys.

511
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,880
Okay, so...

512
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,620
This is what I'm most concerned about.

513
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,040
Um...

514
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,740
About...

515
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,880
Regarding like...

516
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,900
The cleaners coming over.

517
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,240
Um...

518
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,020
Because I can't pretend...

519
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,120
That like...

520
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,840
I mean, I could pretend I'm just a really, really big fan.

521
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,500
You know?

522
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,680
That's the only...

523
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,300
Wait, I just like...

524
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,660
I just really like this character.

525
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,240
And they'll just be like...

526
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,020
Oh my god, she's...

527
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,480
She...

528
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,340
She's a...

529
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,400
She's just...

530
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,260
A weeb.

531
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:55,860
You know?

532
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,680
That's like my only excuse.

533
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm just a really, really big fan.

534
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,100
I'm just...

535
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,840
Incredibly obsessed with Doki Bird.

536
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,480
Yeah, I'll be like...

537
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,700
Oh my god, have you ever seen this VTuber called...

538
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,520
Have you ever watched this streamer?

539
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,080
I don't think they know what VTubers are.

540
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:20,760
I'll be like...

541
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,880
Have you ever watched this streamer called Doki Bird?

542
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,260
Oh my god.

543
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,840
You should really check her out.

544
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,360
Okay, here.

545
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,300
Let me show you guys.

546
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,600
Let me show you guys my...

547
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,620
Trying...

548
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,340
To myself.

549
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,040
That's it.

550
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,000
That's been incomplete for a couple of months now.

551
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,360
For like half...

552
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:39,420
I started this act a year ago and I never finished it.

553
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,280
Because I was like...

554
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,400
What if I move?

555
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,460
And then the only thing I added to it...

556
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,080
Like, I actually added to it...

557
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,940
Was like...

558
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,480
My Sylveon collection at the bottom.

559
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,820
Because I was like...

560
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,880
Where do I put this?

561
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
And I just put...

562
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,300
I just put it there.

563
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:54,780
Because I was like...

564
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,900
I don't know where to put this.

565
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,700
Okay, give me a sec.

566
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,100
Um...

567

572
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,760

573
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,620
Do you think...

574
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,160
Do you think it'll be weird?

575
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,240
Like...

576
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,620
I turn around...

577
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,600
And I...

578
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,460
Um...

579
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,100
I turn around...

580
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,280
And I just see this.

581
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,520
So like...

582
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,280
Do you think...

583
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,520
Do you think...

584
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,300
They'll think...

585
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,240
I'm Jokey Bird?

586
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,520
Or...

587
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,060
Um...

588
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,900
Or...

589
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,060
Or just like...

590
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,260
A really big...

591
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,740
No, that's not all of it.

592
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,180
I have stuff in storage.

593
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,180
This is literally the things I put out...

594
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,560
That I could put out.

595
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,620
Like...

596
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,480

598
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,160
In storage right now.

599
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,400
And like...

600
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,100
It's like...

601
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,600
I just didn't have time to put stuff on it.

602
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,760
Do you think they'll just think I'm a...

603
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,680
I'm just a really big fan?

604
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,760

605
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,700

I'm just a huge fan.

610
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,500
Plus, I love Sylveon.

611
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,720
Like...

612
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,060
The merch box.

613
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:07,740
I do.

614
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,400
Like, I have my drawers.

615
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,140
My drawers has like...

616
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,040
Um...

617
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,960
My drawers is like filled with like...

618
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,660
Uh...

619
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,640
Jokey Bird merch, basically.

620
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,920
They have to come into this room!

621
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,620
That's the thing!

622
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,260
They have to come into this room!

623
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,120
Because, like...

624
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,920
That's where most of the fucking...

625
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,260
That's where a lot of cleaning has to be done.

626
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,120
Because this is my office.

627
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,920
Uh...

628
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:36,860
No!

629
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:37,560
Next scene.

630
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,160
I have a lot of merch.

631
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,860
But it's just all like...

632
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,020
Boxed up or like...

633
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,760
In my drawers.

634
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,760
Because I have not...

635
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,780
Done anything to this shrine since half a year ago.

636
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,420
Um...

637
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,200
Because I was like...

638
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,260
I might be moving.

639
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,180
So what's the point?

640
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:51,580
You know?

641
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,800
I was like...

642
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,880
I might be moving.

643
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,060
So...

644
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,720
What's the point guys?

645
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,020
Um...

646
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,380
They'll probably just think you're another eccentric rich...

647
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,580
Oh yeah, that makes me...

648
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,060
That does sort of make me...

649
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:06,880
Very eccentric.

650
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,210
They're like, yeah, we clean the...

651
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,110
I think they're gonna be like a couple of old ladies.

652
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,280
And they're just gonna be like...

653
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,400
Yeah, she has like...

654
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,310
A really big collection of like...

655
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Of like...

656
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,840
Um...

657
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,680

664
00:21:58,110 --> 00:22:20,030

697
00:25:52,290 --> 00:26:07,650
All right, like I said, okay It's not gonna be a super long stream because I don't want to overdo it since I do have a cuz I won't be streaming The cloud by the way, I won't be streaming the cloud, but I will be showing up Um, it's like a repo collab and I remember who the other people Gumi invited,

698
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:19,390
but I haven't Gumi asked me to join her like a few days ago and I was like I can't but I can't I won't be there for long Though just so you guys know I won't be there for the repo collab for long.

699
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,310
I told her straight up.

700
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:26,250
I was like, um, I can't do it for too long Cuz I'm trying to rest my voice.

701
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,250
Um Anyway, um, what else I want to say?

702
00:26:30,650 --> 00:27:00,310
Oh Yes, I actually looked up how long this game is and so like, you know, no I always do I would be like no commentary Playthrough of insert game here and then like I Pulled up the video and usually, you know those types of players They would they are like they they like play these games before so they think basically it's like the most concise way Playing the game.

703
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,130
So they're just like they don't usually make any errors or anything.

704
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:19,050
It's just they play the game throughout it To the point and then so, you know it's basically like they're usually a little faster and completing the game and stuff versus a regular player and Then so I was like, oh it can't be that bad because they're usually faster,

705
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:19,470
right?

706
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:44,730
so I Looked up the first video, which is the main video and it's not like faster but they like they're usually like a little faster than a regular person and I looked it up and this man's playthrough was 18 hours on and And I was like, where am I at I

707
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:57,610
Was like where am I at in this 18 hour long playthrough surely I'm closer to the 18-hour I'm surely I'm close like I'm in the middle, right?

708
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,990
I was at the 5-hour mark.

709
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,330
I

710
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,870
Was like, oh

711
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:19,190

I played another four So that's seven.

739
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:49,010
We're at okay, that's seven hours and then I played another four That's 11 hours and that played another three So I played 14 hours, but we're at the 8-hour part We're at the 8-hour part, but we've played for 14 hours, so it's not very ideal again We're not a very good pace.

740
00:29:49,050 --> 00:30:14,030
We're completing Dynasty Wars, but we'll try our best Alright Here we go We had to do five hours to balance it out Subtract 35 minutes expert for just chatting sections at the start of each stream That's true, but I don't talk 35 minutes on all of them Anton,

Oh, of course.

747
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:32,770

Thank you, thank you!

758
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,570
Oh my god!

759
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,150
No, we will stay in Luoyang.

760
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:29,690
The lords need calming and the city must be rebuilt You fool Yuan Shao.

761
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,750
Have you forgot?

762
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,970
Am I not killing him yet?

763
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,370
Oh, wait.

764
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:41,250
No, I haven't That felt like such a fucking long-ass war Do you not see the city in ruins?

765
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,290
People don't even know where their next meal will come from.

766
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,370
It's okay, they'll make more children Coalition forces are still exhausted after the battle at Hulao Gate.

767
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,130
Yeah, but they're exhausted too.

768
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:58,490
Enough pretentious talk What are you after Yuan Shao?

769
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,530
Isn't that obvious?

770
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:07,210
The Yellow Turbans and Dong Zhuo have driven the world further into chaos.

771
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:10,030
A worthy Individual must step up.

772
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:10,850
That's me!

773
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:11,990
That's me!

774
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,250
He's talking about me!

775
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,490
Wait, I think he's talking about himself, guys

776
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:25,450
Wait a minute Not me?

777
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,100
To restore the land Wait a minute, it can't be So you aim for glory well above your station

778
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:46,270
I believe it Why is it me?

779
00:32:46,350 --> 00:33:12,790
I literally beat up Liu Bu While using save states That doesn't matter guys, it's Liu Bu We need every advantage against him No soul should have to face the loss of their family or home in such a way We should prepare to enter Luoyang There may still be people who need help You can't do save states!

780
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:16,090
You saw what I went through!

781
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:37,730
There's no way you individually would be able to Fucking beat Liu Bu without save states There's no fucking way without checkpoints You cannot oof me There's no fucking way I wanna see a dragon fucking beat Liu Bu Without checkpoints You cannot oof me As a first try As like a first time fighting him too

782
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:45,130
Yeah and tell me how long it took you

783
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,770
Oof Thank you for the super chat.

784
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,770
Thank you.

785
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:56,670
Yeah, I always start watching streamers at the most awkward time.

786
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,410
At moments, I heard the word fujo.

787
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,390
Yeah, and then tell me how long it took you without checkpoints.

788
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,640
Who's the other guy?

789
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,040
He looks so generic.

790
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,080
It's like, guys, who do you think the main character is in this story?

791
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,480
It's like one of those anime main characters.

792
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:43,200
Protagonist.

793
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,580
Guess which one's the main character.

794
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,140
Is that Yun Shao without his helmet?

795
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:57,140
Oh my god, put that thing back on, you posy.

796
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,040
He looks so weird when he's not pretentious as fuck.

797
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,140
He looks so generic without the pretentiousness.

798
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,720
Yeah, no, you can tell it's Liu Bei because of his ears.

799
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,980
That's like, but he does look generic without it.

800
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,380
Yeah, the helmet stays on.

801
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,260
And the green.

802
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,480
Yeah, there's a dress code, guys.

803
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:38,720
When you join a kingdom, you can only wear green, blue, or red.

804
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,070
If you do not do well- if you do not look good in green, well, I'm sorry, I guess-

805
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,030
It's the Power Ranger rules.

806
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:01,950
Do you really?

807
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,190
I think- yeah, he did.

808
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,230
He did have the seal.

809
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,650
Sun Jian had the seal.

810
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,510
Call for me when you need me.

811
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,030
I just wanna keep my connections open, you know?

812
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:15,590
Can't keep all my eggs in one basket.

813
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,590
Oh my god, boys!

814
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,630
Boys!

815
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,430
Please, there's enough doki to go around.

816
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:40,970
They're fighting over me.

817
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,050
Stop fighting, guys.

818
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,330
Oh, boys!

819
00:36:58,950 --> 00:36:59,690
Boys!

820
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,770
Wow!

821
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,050
So popular.

822
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,010
Stop fighting, boys.

823
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:23,690
They're like, oh, they're talking so seriously about the fucking seal.

824
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,410
They're trying to discuss politics right now.

825
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,990
They're like, oh, silly boys.

826
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:45,930
They aren't even talking about you!

827
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,030
Calm down.

828
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,710
Okay, guys, enough about the Imperial Seal, guys.

829
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:55,710
I'm also here.

830
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:21,310
It's all coded word, guys.

831
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:24,950
When they talk about Imperial Seal, they're talking about me, guys.

832
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,070
Oh my god, Liu Bei, don't say that about yourself.

833
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,130
Say that later, cuz say that later when you lose.

834
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,330
When you lose it all.

835
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:09,350
This is actually your peak right now, Liu Bei.

836
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,950
This is his peak moment here.

837
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,910
Oh, they're asking my opinion?

838
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:19,630
Oh, shit.

839
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,150
Sorry, I was too busy watching.

840
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,390
Perhaps not.

841
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,350
I don't fucking know.

842
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,370
Maybe I should just give zero opinion.

843
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,650
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

844
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:37,430
Left Doki.

845
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:40,370
Sorry, I keep forgetting Left Doki has to exist here.

846
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:43,830
Alright, alright, you see that?

847
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:44,950
Alright, Left Doki's here.

848
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:51,410
Every time another Doki appears, one has to be destroyed, so say goodbye to Right Doki.

849
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,370
Her existence is no more.

850
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,590
Oh, sorry, it glitched out.

851
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,850
Right Doki was like, no, don't delete me!

852
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,870
I refuse to be deleted.

853
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,250
Sorry, now she's deleted.

854
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,250
Alright, I don't know what she wanted to say.

855
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,650
Keep Right Doki, but make it too late.

856
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,630
She's gone now.

857
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:26,130
Alright, remain silent.

858
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,150
You're right, I shouldn't give my opinion.

859
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,510
I should just let the boys have their thing.

860
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,850
To me, though, both of you appear to have the qualities needed for such a task.

861
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:50,530
Quintess, you blinked out and died like an old-school JRPG character.

862
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,970
Yeah, the snab-like claws, the flicker of death.

863
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,730
Anyway, I should depart.

864
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:02,210
I am sure my camp is tired of waiting for me.

865
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,310
Then allow me to see you off, Lord Sun Tien.

866
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:15,470
What the fuck, little boy?

867
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,830
Don't do that.

868
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:23,550
Oh, what the fuck?

869
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,010
It's not time to get high right now.

870
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:34,170
What do you mean?

871
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,170
You guys didn't know the story- how the kid appears?

872
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,170
It's when the, um...

873
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,890
It's when- what is it called?

874
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,650
The incense?

875
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:48,630
The incense gets, like, way too much and then I see the little boy.

876
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,350
So I'm like, who the fuck lit up the funny incense?

877
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,890
Oh, shit, dragoons.

878
00:41:59,010 --> 00:41:59,790
You're right, sorry.

879
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,910
I didn't realize some of you guys are still alive because I sent a lot of you guys to Lu Bu.

880
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:08,890
Really?

881
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,430
After I sent you to Lu Bu?

882
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,170
Oh my god.

883
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:20,850
We live.

884
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,290
Well, in my- my death.

885
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,530
We are very hard to kill.

886
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:31,330
I mean, to be fair, I thought, like, I had more of you guys.

887
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:36,130
But we did just came back from trying- killing Lu Bu.

888
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:39,070
So, like, I think I lost, like, 90% of my army.

889
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:40,230
I'm pretty sure.

890
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,050
Like, it's like the bacteria thing.

891
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,510
You know, it kills 99% of bacteria.

892
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:48,030
I think you guys were the 1% that lived.

893
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,730
Um, there's only 4 left.

894
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,090
After I sent us all to, like, to Lu Bu.

895
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:55,990
So...

896
00:42:58,030 --> 00:43:01,650
Uh, we had to get rid of the weaklings.

897
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:07,770
The five remaining dragons.

898
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,610
The Fab Five.

899
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:17,870
There's five of them now!

900
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,610
Sun Jian was the first to lead the coalition, followed by Cao Cao.

901
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:26,770
Finally, even Zhang took his lead with Lu Bei.

902
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:31,750
Soon enough, mutual suspicion among the noblen devolved into outright squabbling.

903
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:36,350
The coalition formed to defeat Dong Zhuo came to a faltering end.

904
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:37,790
Alright, dragons.

905
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:44,770
Who do we call the- the last remaining five dragons that survived the great Lu Bu attack?

906
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:49,110
What's this?

907
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,880
It's time to camp.

908
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,300
Yao Chen, what?

909
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,740
The unlucky one.

910
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,140
The Gouda gang.

911
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,620
What the fuck, you fucking tried to kill me!

912
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:15,900
Goodbye.

913
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:21,740
Why am I talking to- she literally tried to 1v1 me.

914
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,520
Oh, thank God.

915
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,960
I don't want to meet her again.

916
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,860
I have made sure of that.

917
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,660
What do you mean?

918
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:43,620
I went to Chang'an with Dong Zhuo, and I saw the destruction.

919
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,620
No crawls allowed.

920
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:47,720
Is what I knew.

921
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:54,960
To kill a beast that has bested all men, I need to unleash an even bigger beast.

922
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,520
Oh, Lu Bu.

923
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:01,500
I will use myself as bait to pit Lu Bu against Dong Zhuo.

924
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,220
Oh no.

925
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,120
No matter what happens, I cannot allow the strategy to fail.

926
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,500
I can't believe you would do that to yourself.

927
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,900
Dating Lu Bu, the greatest man during the Three Kingdoms era?

928
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,760
What a fucking criminal act you're doing right now.

929
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,200
Oh no.

930
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,280
The strongest fucking man out there during Three Kingdoms.

931
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,900
Oh, what a sacrifice to humanity.

932
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,780
It should have been me, not her.

933
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,540
Don't go.

934
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:55,880
I'm not.

935
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:56,740
No, go alone.

936
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,520
Jealous much?

937
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,600
Oh no, what a great sacrifice you're making.

938
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:24,830
It's so disgusting to have to date Lu Bu.

939
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:31,870
Wow, Jesus Christ, the size differences between those two.

940
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:34,810
I'll make your dream a reality.

941
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,010
Wow, and he's a gentleman?

942
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,250
Wow, Diao Chan.

943
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,410
Truly, you should look for someone else.

944
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,670
Wow, oh my god.

945
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:59,490
I can't believe you could do something so disgusting and be a gentleman.

946
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,330
What is he doing?

947
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:18,470
Someone's... how terrible, what a sacrifice.

948
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,740
Oh?

949
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:29,270
Where did she come from?

950
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:30,410
He was there first.

951
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:31,770
Lu Bu led first.

952
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:39,690
How did she get there before him?

953
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:40,890
It makes no sense.

954
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:42,770
Oh!

955
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,710
Wait, he still has his head.

956
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,550
Okay, yeah, he's dead.

957
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:03,870
Rip the Dong.

958
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,230
Goodbye, Dong.

959
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,630
That's it, they just killed him.

960
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,310
The Dong was cut.

961
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:16,210
Wait, that's it?

962
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:17,810
That's how he's gonna die?

963
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:24,700
That felt so anticlimactic, the big Dong himself.

964
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,670
Oh my god, we finally finished chapter two.

965
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:05,570
Why is Sun Jian like the main character for this part?

966
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:06,620
He dies like...

967
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:10,150
He dies like in one more fight.

968
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:15,410
He's not even supposed to be part of the Three Kingdoms, he was not there.

969
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:20,450
Why did they put him in the center?

970
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,110
In the other games, he literally dies after two fights.

971
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,950
Get a little spoiled, Ace.

972
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:41,690
Let him have his moment, this is his one time.

973
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:49,190
Spoilers!

974
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:54,350
I'm sorry that this happened like how many hundreds of years ago?

975
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:58,290
Spoiler for a 1,500 year old book.

976
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,050
Okay, any interesting news?

977
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,530
Lords from somewhere or other looking for soldiers and such?

978
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:15,050
I don't know much about it, but I think it must have something to do with that great battle at the capital and whatnot.

979
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:18,390
So how are things around here?

980
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,470
We've had people who lost their land and homes down south, making their way up here.

981
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,530
I've also got a strange feeling that I'm hearing more talk of bloodshed than usual.

982
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,030
These are dark times we're in, indeed.

983
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,970
Are there any fan mail for me?

984
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:38,870
Yay!

985
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:44,210
More dragoons to recruit into my army!

986
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:45,510
It's Keilupu's guy.

987
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,450
Guys, you'll survive this time.

988
00:50:52,410 --> 00:50:54,390
I don't have anything else to ask.

989
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:57,130
Thank you, Mr. Exposition.

990
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,630
Yay, fan mail!

991
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:09,250
Alright, let's see what kind of fan mail I got, guys.

992
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,710
Oh man, the incense.

993
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,190
I saw the incense, guys.

994
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:34,870
You see this shit, little boy?

995
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,170
My doctor boy.

996
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,690
Child be gone.

997
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,650
I mean, he is gone.

998
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:48,650
Alright.

999
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,670
Wait, that's not my dragoons.

1000
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:57,830
Aw, come on, man.

1001
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,090
Why?

1002
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,190
You're right here!

1003
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,610
You can just tell me!

1004
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:06,750
You and Hua.

1005
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,050
Alright.

1006
00:52:09,670 --> 00:52:12,110
Zilong, your knife hand technique is very impressive.

1007
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:14,630
Just the other day, we all died.

1008
00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,290
There's not a lot of dragoons left alive to write you fan mail.

1009
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:20,150
Doki.

1010
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:31,950
Just the other day, when you noticed the cooking knife was rusty and there wasn't a spare in sight, you sliced the radish, cleaning with your hand, and then you made short work of a huge turnip where you see, while even thinking to fetch a cleaver.

1011
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,570
Where did you learn to do that?

1012
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:37,470
It was- This isn't even a report about my health!

1013
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:39,910
He's just glazing me up.

1014
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:42,390
Like, what the fuck?

1015
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:46,050
It was a magnificent show of skill.

1016
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:50,150
It's one thing- I thought you were here to observe my health!

1017
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:56,950
Um...

1018
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:01,210
You seem to naturally intuit the perfect place to slice, or what it looks like to me, anyway.

1019
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,970
Perhaps somehow you were close to in the past also have the skill.

1020
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,310
And with luck, perhaps some clues will take us closer to restoring your memory.

1021
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,970
He is observing me way too much.

1022
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,370
Not Doki, it's been too long.

1023
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:16,670
Come to the usual place!

1024
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:19,890
Oh my god, guys!

1025
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:24,610
Guys, I got a date tonight!

1026
00:53:27,490 --> 00:53:29,770
Oh my god!

1027
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,690
I got a date with God Knee!

1028
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:39,890
Come to the usual place!

1029
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,870
This one's on me!

1030
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,850
My men are cool!

1031
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,350
You're inviting more people?

1032
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:54,950
They all wanna hear what you've been up- Woah, God Knee, you fucking freak!

1033
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:56,070
Woah!

1034
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:00,630
Suddenly, they're all your biggest fans!

1035
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,450
Anyway, we're waiting.

1036
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,630
I hope- okay, Sima Hui.

1037
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:12,350
I heard there was a great battle near the city, and that you played no small part in it.

1038
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:16,130
Now I have something I wish to tell you, so come visit my retreat!

1039
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:23,230
When you have the chance, I think I can help you with- No, best explain in person.

1040
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,410
I think I'll be waiting.

1041
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:33,770
Oh my god!

1042
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,750
Oh man, they're all pirates, dude.

1043
00:54:35,890 --> 00:54:37,170
God Ning and his crew.

1044
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,090
You got a unitized dragon, then she'll take care of our lives.

1045
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:47,430
That's not so dead- Well, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

1046
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,310
Oh damn!

1047
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,110
Alright, we'll go to God Ning first.

1048
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,990
Then I'll go to our usual place.

1049
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,530
Wherever the fuck that is.

1050
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:01,130
Where the fuck is our usual place?

1051
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:03,330
Is that God Ning?

1052
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,390
No, that's Zhuo Chang.

1053
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:14,350
Where the fuck is God- Bro, where is my usual place?

1054
00:55:19,450 --> 00:55:24,630
How can you not rem- Jokey, how can you not rem- Okay, we'll just go visit Sima Kui first.

1055
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:28,670
How do you guys remember the usual place?

1056
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:29,690
Wait, Pang Tong?

1057
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:32,570
Pang Tong?

1058
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:33,790
What are you doing here?

1059
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,630
I wasn't supposed to meet you yet.

1060
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,630
Why are you wearing green?

1061
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:46,930
Why are you wearing green yet?

1062
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:48,170
The kingdom hasn't started.

1063
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:50,910
Yes.

1064
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:00,950
You've formed into a stronger Fuzhou.

1065
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,890
Thank you for the super chat, Kaz.

1066
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:03,990
Thank you, thank you.

1067
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:13,630
Clearly he wasn't concerned as he told me to run the place the way I see fit.

1068
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:17,330
But he also mentioned that you were a special guest.

1069
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:20,410
To be treated with our utmost hospitality.

1070
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:24,690
Spencer, thank you for the super chat.

1071
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,370
Thank you, thank you.

1072
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:32,410
You should know, we guys take our bros relationship to the- Yeah, you guys remember where our usual special place is.

1073
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:35,670
I was like, where the fuck is- I can't believe it, Jokey.

1074
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,550
By the way guys, we met Gan Ning once, by the way.

1075
00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:41,750
And you guys were like, I can't believe it, Jokey.

1076
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:45,330
I can't believe you would forget our special usual place that's down south.

1077
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,550
That's really far away.

1078
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:48,910
I'm like, how the fuck do you remember that?

1079
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:56,450
And you- It's our bro's special place, Jokey.

1080
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,890
Of course we'll remember it.

1081
00:57:00,110 --> 00:57:03,150
She'll never understand our bond.

1082
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,590
Okay, I look for- Yeah, where is he?

1083
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:13,790
It means nothing to you, so you don't remember.

1084
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,650
Jokey doesn't understand the bro's code.

1085
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,090
Oh, that's interesting.

1086
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:37,090
They gave Peng Tong.

1087
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,530
They're trying to make us bond with him before they killed him off.

1088
00:57:42,410 --> 00:57:43,730
That's fucked up.

1089
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:46,490
That's so fucked up.

1090
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,470
Like, he's gonna die and then he just won't be back here anymore.

1091
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:54,330
That's so fucked up.

1092
00:57:55,990 --> 00:57:59,370
Okay, I have so many people I have to talk to?

1093
00:57:59,370 --> 00:57:59,730
Help!

1094
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,930
Okay, Gong- Okay, Jing Province.

1095
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:05,930
Oh my god!

1096
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:06,890
Boys!

1097
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:07,950
Boys!

1098
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:11,470
Calm down, everyone!

1099
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:12,690
Woah!

1100
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:17,740
Is this a spoiler from the Invincible comics?

1101
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:18,690
Is it?

1102
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:24,670
Gong Ning.

1103
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:26,970
Okay, Jing Province.

1104
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,970
It's like the fucking...

1105
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:35,890
People complaining about the fucking Invincible comics spoilers for the show.

1106
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:39,050
Alright, let's go to...

1107
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,650
Let's go to Jing Province first.

1108
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,290
To our special place.

1109
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:46,010
Yu Province.

1110
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:48,130
Jing Province.

1111
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:50,010
Woah, what the fuck, it's so far!

1112
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,430
Wait, Lu Bu!

1113
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,510
Woah!

1114
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:56,790
We'll call Lu Bu later, okay guys?

1115
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:00,130
Gong Ning sent us an actual letter.

1116
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:13,190
Oh my god!

1117
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,650
He made us dinner and everything?

1118
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,650
Oh my god, like his crew are like his kids!

1119
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,910
Like, Papa!

1120
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,710
When will we see Papa Doki again?

1121
00:59:32,350 --> 00:59:35,370
Your really good friend Doki again.

1122
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,130
You think so?

1123
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:41,850
Papa!

1124
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,390
Papa Gong Ning!

1125
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:46,690
When will we see your really, really, really good friend?

1126
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:49,550
Okay,

1127
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:55,260
you think so?

1128
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:59,760
Oh my god.

1129
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:01,580
He's glazing me up, guys!

1130
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,620
Your war pit buddy that you share your tent with!

1131
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:32,640
Oh, you wanna settle down?

1132
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,320
I mean...

1133
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,240
Yeah, after this I have to meet up with Lu Bu and everything.

1134
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,500
So...

1135
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,120
I'm still not sure.

1136
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:00,260
I didn't wanna talk about this.

1137
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,740
But if not now, then when, right?

1138
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,100
I got an invitation from Jing province.

1139
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:08,580
See?

1140
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,800
I ain't sure if I should accept it or not.

1141
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:16,720
I don't even know the caliber of the guy who sent the invitation.

1142
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,560
You fucking...

1143
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:21,460
Okay, so like, if we're talking about like actual travel time.

1144
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:24,380
I travel like, could've been traveling for one week.

1145
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:26,120
Just to ask me what you...

1146
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:28,600
Should accept the invitation or not.

1147
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:40,110
Follow your heart.

1148
01:01:40,150 --> 01:01:44,190
Like, technically I could've been traveling for like an entire week.

1149
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:46,230
I was on the other side of China.

1150
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,670
And I had to travel to the...

1151
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,450
And I had to travel to the other side of China.

1152
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:52,790
To get to him.

1153
01:01:53,290 --> 01:01:55,590
And all he wants to ask me is like...

1154
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:56,550
Should I take...

1155
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,770
Should I say yes to this?

1156
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,230
This could've been a fucking text message.

1157
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,950
He is a single father.

1158
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,770
She'll never understand.

1159
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:14,450
Should I accept this job offer?

1160
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,470
This could've been a text.

1161
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:21,250
Follow your heart.

1162
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,690
What seems best.

1163
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:34,370
I really appreciate you.

1164
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:36,210
Coming around.

1165
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:38,570
To see me like this.

1166
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:39,490
That's fine.

1167
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:40,270
Well.

1168
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:42,990
It'd be nice.

1169
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:44,870
Some more time like this.

1170
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:49,130
Send my boys on home.

1171
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:49,970
At some point.

1172
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:51,630
Oh, you're gonna send them home?

1173
01:02:52,530 --> 01:02:53,990
Oh my god!

1174
01:02:54,910 --> 01:02:56,410
Okay, it was worth it.

1175
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:57,910
Oh!

1176
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,690
Then we could enjoy some quiet time!

1177
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,300
What the fuck!

1178
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,760
Oh my god!

1179
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,580
Oh shit!

1180
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:18,960
Oh!

1181
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:25,500
Some quiet time between you and all that!

1182
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:26,420
There's no way!

1183
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:28,740
Oh!

1184
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,340
The fact that he was like.

1185
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,420
I'm gonna send my boys home.

1186
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,520
And then we could spend some quiet time.

1187
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,700
You and me!

1188
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:39,860
Okay!

1189
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:43,000
That's not even subtle at all!

1190
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:43,760
Guys!

1191
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:45,640
That was not subtle!

1192
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,020
That was straight up!

1193
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,340
What the fuck!

1194
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,240
What else would he be implying?

1195
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:52,040
Chat.

1196
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,980
What else would he be implying?

1197
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,460
Guys!

1198
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,700
You cannot tell me!

1199
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,720
There was any other implications there!

1200
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,720
There was no!

1201
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:05,580
What else would he be doing?

1202
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:06,820
Quiet time!

1203
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,120
Sorry!

1204
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:15,380
Smash Bros with a bro, you know?

1205
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:20,200
He just wanted to show his Bionicle collection!

1206
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,160
Just wrestling!

1207
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:26,940
Never a dull moment with you around!

1208
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:50,460
These are chaotic times!

1209
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,980
There's no telling what might happen to us!

1210
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:57,900
Now I understand the context of that fujo statement earlier!

1211
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,900
Thank you for the super chat!

1212
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:00,840
Guys!

1213
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,500
This has nothing to do with being a reformed fujo!

1214
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:07,080
That was not subtle!

1215
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,180
What else could they be implying?

1216
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:18,660
If I wasn't a reformed fujo, I would even imply that they did something!

1217
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:21,360
Hey!

1218
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:27,740
Make sure you keep training just in case you get caught up in something while I'm not around!

1219
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:30,060
I don't want you to get hurt!

1220
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:30,860
Baby!

1221
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:34,840
Bro!

1222
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,420
Where did the fucking gangning love interest came from?

1223
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:42,480
Jesus Christ!

1224
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,380
I was not ready for that!

1225
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:49,720
I was not ready for that, guys!

1226
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:52,260
Oh my god!

1227
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:57,800
When were you getting hurt, babe?

1228
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,560
Oh shit!

1229
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:01,760
Oh my god!

1230
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,700
I got more!

1231
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,120
We're waiting for you!

1232
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,480
Jesus Christ!

1233
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:09,120
It's been a while since last we met!

1234
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,360
Chaochao has brought many new talents under his command!

1235
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:13,180
Oh my god!

1236
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,800
I have to pick!

1237
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:22,460
It's given the order for us to take the field in Yang Province and we're very pissed if you could lend us your strength in this battle.

1238
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:26,160
If you're interested, come- Why did Chaochao not send a letter?

1239
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,020
Why was it Xiaohudun that sent- Oh my god, Chaochao, you tsundere!

1240
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:33,060
Everyone else sent me a letter except for you guys!

1241
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:35,780
Maybe Xiaohudun really wanted to talk to me, though.

1242
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:37,900
We're waiting for you!

1243
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:39,720
Okay.

1244
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,340
How you been lately?

1245
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:47,400
My days are so busy that I'm having a tr- What an interesting harem anime.

1246
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,640
Osni, thank you for the super chat.

1247
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,620
Thank you, thank you.

1248
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,060
If they were doing a deed, it wouldn't be a very quiet time.

1249
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:57,200
Thank you for the super chat, Osni.

1250
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,020
Thank you, thank you.

1251
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:10,560
Hot warlords in your area- single hot warlords in your area right now must be tired of watching me because all they talk about is wanting to see you!

1252
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,840
Oh, bro!

1253
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,120
Okay, sorry.

1254
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:24,500
If the feeling is mutual, come on over and pay us a visit.

1255
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:29,760
My sworn brothers and I are looking forward to more fun times.

1256
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:30,620
Bro!

1257
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:45,620
Whoever- Whoever did the localization for the English, I- Oh my god, people were saying the Japanese and the Chinese version of this game was also very similar.

1258
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:46,520
I-

1259
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,520
Soon - yeah.

1260
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:54,200
Oh my god.

1261
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:59,240
Can you come- I haven't even fucking actually played the game yet.

1262
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:03,020
We're just- I'm fucking playing a visual novel right now.

1263
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:06,460
Can you come to Nyang Nyang as soon as you read this?

1264
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,980
We've gotten ourselves into a entire situation and we welcome your strength and our struggle to break through of it.

1265
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,900
You'll have to wait until we can speak in person for more details.

1266
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,160
I am certain that we can- Okay, Soon-Chi-En is normal.

1267
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,380
He's normal.

1268
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,860
He's actually been normal.

1269
01:08:22,740 --> 01:08:24,000
Paladin, thank you for the super chat.

1270
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:25,000
Thank you, thank you.

1271
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:25,820
You know what's crazy?

1272
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:28,180
This entire time, we have not fought one battle yet.

1273
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,640
The downtime fight has left more time for the pros.

1274
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:33,180
Thank you for the super chat.

1275
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:33,720
Thank you.

1276
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:34,900
Thank you.

1277
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,680
Not so Deadpool.

1278
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:44,960
And here we see a Pharaoh Fujoki bird in her natural habitat watching how she guides the Ikemen together effortlessly.

1279
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,940
Thank you for the super chat.

1280
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:48,100
Thank you, thank you.

1281
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:48,520
Okay.

1282
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:52,560
Alright, we gotta go through our other routes right now.

1283
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,760
Des knew what they were doing.

1284
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,620
God, thank you for the super chat.

1285
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,800
Thank you, thank you.

1286
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,780
There's so many men.

1287
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,520
So many routes.

1288
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,980
I don't know which one to pick.

1289
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,480
They all want a piece of me.

1290
01:09:22,940 --> 01:09:23,680
Not yet.

1291
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,940
I've made up my mind.

1292
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,940
Sun Jian.

1293
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:34,620
Liu Bei.

1294
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,620
Is there anyone worthy of being called a true hero?

1295
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,040
In time, they are certain to clash with one another.

1296
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:47,540
When that happens...

1297
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:48,380
Oh, I'm picking Liu Bei.

1298
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,080
I'm picking Xu, by the way.

1299
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:51,160
I'm doing Liu Bei.

1300
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:54,580
Your decision will set the course of our future.

1301
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,400
Only for my Oshi Zhuge Liang.

1302
01:09:56,700 --> 01:10:00,280
And those who take the wrong path, just as Zheng Zhao and Dong Zhuo.

1303
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:02,120
That's the only reason why I'm picking him.

1304
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:04,640
And to see Peng Tong die again.

1305
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,160
I want you to show me the choice you've made.

1306
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:14,500
What do you mean boring?

1307
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:18,740
People are ruining...

1308
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,680
Initially, you can assist any of the three vows.

1309
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:28,120
However, when you reach a pivotal point in history, you will no longer be able to fight alongside a hero if you have not made enough contributions to your cause.

1310
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:31,780
As history has written, the heroes may come into conflict with one another.

1311
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:37,400
When this happens, you must side with a faction, after which you will be unable to assist the faction you did not choose.

1312
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:42,480
Listen to your dreams, watch your actions, and decide which one...

1313
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,160
will be able to bring peace to the realm.

1314
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:47,800
Everyone... That is not true.

1315
01:10:48,140 --> 01:10:51,080
Everyone picks Cao Cao more, I'm pretty sure.

1316
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:53,360
I feel like Cao Cao has a better...

1317
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,860
Definitely has like...

1318
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,940
Lu... Xu...

1319
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,840
Lu Bei has better...

1320
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,280
Lu Bei has better heroes because like for some fucking reason...

1321
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:09,480
For some reason, like...

1322
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,480
Kouei loves Lu Bei.

1323
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,540
They love Xu.

1324
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:23,260
And they always... They put... They put all their efforts in designing the best character designs and the best, like... The best, like character designs and putting every...

1325
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:25,380
Like everybody's Xu in the front...

1326
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:26,400
Like in the front.

1327
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,200
But I think Wu has better history.

1328
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:33,440
Also, Lu Bei... Lu Bei's a fuckhead.

1329
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,160
He's like... What's the word called?

1330
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:38,560
He's a fucking poser.

1331
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,780
He's always so discreet.

1332
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:42,040
It actually makes him memorable.

1333
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:46,640
Okay.

1334
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:50,100
I don't know how to explain Lu Bei.

1335
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:51,220
He's like...

1336
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:52,800
He's like a deadbeat.

1337
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,160
I think... Is that... Is that a better way to explain it?

1338
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:58,680
He's like actually like a deadbeat where he does nothing.

1339
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:01,200
But he has... He has the best generals.

1340
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:05,280
He has the best generals, the best strategists, and he does nothing with them.

1341
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,160
Because all he does is talk about fucking benevolence.

1342
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,120
That's all he does.

1343
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:13,400
Okay, where's Lu Bu?

1344
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,580
I talked to Lu Bu.

1345
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:17,760
He's a fraud.

1346
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,020
He's a... He's not a netbo... Netbo baby because he was born poor.

1347
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:24,900
He's just incredibly...

1348
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:29,420
He's incredibly lucky, but he does nothing with his luck.

1349
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:31,620
Where the fuck is Lu Bu?

1350
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:41,990
Where's Lu Bu?

1351
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,170
I'm gonna travel here to figure out where Lu Bu is.

1352
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:50,310
Oh, wait, what?

1353
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:52,350
Where's your super chat, Ava?

1354
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,490
Let me check.

1355
01:12:55,830 --> 01:12:57,070
Ava, thank you for the super chat.

1356
01:12:57,170 --> 01:12:58,010
Thank you, thank you.

1357
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,510
That's why...

1358
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:02,210
That's why I didn't read it.

1359
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:05,550
Hi, this is my main account for now.

1360
01:13:05,950 --> 01:13:10,310
Had better memories last year than I can express and looking forward to making new memories.

1361
01:13:11,370 --> 01:13:13,030
Thank you for the super chat, Ava.

1362
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:14,170
Thank you, thank you.

1363
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:17,670
Alright, let's figure out where Lu Bu is.

1364
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:24,390
Is your reputation not bad when you say it?

1365
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:25,570
Alright, where is Lu Bu?

1366
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:29,190
He is at Shu Province.

1367
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,610
Okay.

1368
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:34,370
Alright.

1369
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:36,230
Where is Shu Province?

1370
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:38,090
Or...

1371
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,850
Oh, there it is.

1372
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,030
Why does it show Lu Bu?

1373
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:44,070
Where is he?

1374
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:47,910
I wanna talk to you.

1375
01:13:50,350 --> 01:13:51,390
Where is he?

1376
01:13:53,470 --> 01:13:54,170
Is that him?

1377
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:55,450
I think that's him.

1378
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:56,570
That has to be him.

1379
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,370
Yo, that's just a regular man.

1380
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:00,250
The fuck is he?

1381
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:06,960
I'm at... Okay, I'm back at Jin.

1382
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,440
Wait, the fuck?

1383
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:12,860
You said it was at you, right?

1384
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:14,720
Wait, no, that's Shu.

1385
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:15,260
Okay.

1386
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,760
I'm so confused.

1387
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,160
Where is...

1388
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,940
Oh, it's right here.

1389
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:21,300
Okay.

1390
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:21,360
Okay.

1391
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,100
It's this way.

1392
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,200
Guys, I don't know my east in my...

1393
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:28,200
I don't know my east here.

1394
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:33,930
Where the fuck?

1395
01:14:37,290 --> 01:14:38,530
Where the fuck?

1396
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:43,560
Where is it?

1397
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,800
Is it here?

1398
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:52,540
Yo, that's Jin.

1399
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,860
Oh my god.

1400
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:56,800
I'm so lost.

1401
01:14:57,700 --> 01:14:58,340
Guys.

1402
01:14:58,500 --> 01:14:59,700
Oh my god, there's Xi Bi.

1403
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:02,680
Guys, I'm so lost.

1404
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:04,920
I'm so...

1405
01:15:04,920 --> 01:15:05,920
Oh, it's locked?

1406
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,240
No!

1407
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,020
They're preventing me from...

1408
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:11,100
They're preventing my Lu Bu route.

1409
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,200
That's so fucked.

1410
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,720
Why would you prevent me from...

1411
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:16,920
having my Lu Bu moment?

1412
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:19,940
That's so messed up.

1413
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,020
You are not allowed to pursue him.

1414
01:15:30,110 --> 01:15:31,510
Thank you for the super chat, Alcarin.

1415
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:32,410
Thank you.

1416
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:33,550
Will you do all the...

1417
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:35,070
Your very first super chat.

1418
01:15:35,190 --> 01:15:35,870
Thank you.

1419
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:37,910
Will you do all the faction stories or just one?

1420
01:15:38,010 --> 01:15:39,690
Tao Tao's objectively... I want to do all of them.

1421
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:41,790
I'll be doing all of them, but I'm doing...

1422
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:43,990
Lu Bei's first because...

1423
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:45,790
Just for my Oshi, Zhuge Liang.

1424
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,470
Zhuge Liang.

1425
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:47,530
He's my Oshi.

1426
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:50,390
And he's like my favorite character in the entire Three Kingdoms.

1427
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:51,690
So...

1428
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:54,230
That's why I want to do his first.

1429
01:15:55,010 --> 01:15:56,510
Tao Tao's objectively the...

1430
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:57,330
correct choice, but it's up to you.

1431
01:15:57,430 --> 01:15:59,890
As for the Sun Clan, Sun Qian's route isn't lewd at all.

1432
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:00,570
I'm not joking.

1433
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:01,470
Thank you for the super chat.

1434
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:01,810
Thank you.

1435
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,330
Yeah, because she gets fucking married to Lu Bei.

1436
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:06,390
She's a taken...

1437
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:06,690
girl.

1438
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,940
You do not look friendly.

1439
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,500
You look like you're about to...

1440
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,480
You look like you're about to...

1441
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:23,940
fucking backstab me...

1442
01:16:23,940 --> 01:16:24,740
at any moment.

1443
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,640
Break from what?

1444
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:31,180
Why me?

1445
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,240
Oh.

1446
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,580
Yeah, but even...

1447
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:50,040
But he's actually not friendly.

1448
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:51,400
He's backstabbed people.

1449
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:56,180
He's actually not even friendly.

1450
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,800
Even though he doesn't look like it.

1451
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:58,720
He says he's friendly.

1452
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:00,600
He actually backstabs people.

1453
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,820
Learn when you was defeated?

1454
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,600
He has friends.

1455
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:14,380
Just friends.

1456
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:25,840
Ambitious people like them...

1457
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,780
always assume everybody else thinks...

1458
01:17:27,780 --> 01:17:28,900
the same way they do.

1459
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:31,860
So in their minds...

1460
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,720
anyone not demanding promotion...

1461
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,130
for their achievements, like me...

1462
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:37,720
is suspect.

1463
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,110
So the more work I do...

1464
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,440
the less I'm trusted.

1465
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:44,260
Still, writing that out...

1466
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:45,540
is also part of being a tactician.

1467
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,540
Then get your promotion.

1468
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,160
Just to be less suspectable.

1469
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:52,020
Making me spill my story like that.

1470
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,000
I said one thing.

1471
01:17:57,760 --> 01:17:59,100
You just kept talking.

1472
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:01,680
That's what I said!

1473
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:02,660
Okay, no.

1474
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:03,660
I shouldn't say that.

1475
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,920
That was in for us.

1476
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:06,800
I just said one thing.

1477
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,540
Oh my god.

1478
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:19,360
I hope you say yes.

1479
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:20,260
Whoa.

1480
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:35,180
I have so much res, I don't even need to try.

1481
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:38,340
Guys, I haven't been in my first battle yet.

1482
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:40,860
There's so many men...

1483
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:41,980
asking for me.

1484
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:47,340
I'm so popular, guys.

1485
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,620
I'm so popular.

1486
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,240
I literally...

1487
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,400
have yet to...

1488
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,180
progress.

1489
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,760
Because I have so many...

1490
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:00,800
routes to do.

1491
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,840
Okay, Yang.

1492
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:08,640
No, that's Li province.

1493
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:09,860
Okay, there we go.

1494
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,220
Alright, Li Dian.

1495
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:13,320
Oh my god.

1496
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,820
There's the queue.

1497
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,300
I have to go through my queue right now.

1498
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:36,450
He wants to text the Confucius.

1499
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,180
Wait, what's the November pop-up smurf?

1500
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,700
Thank you for the super chat.

1501
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:49,820
Thank you.

1502
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:59,240
Who was that elderly man?

1503
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,240
That was my teacher.

1504
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,240
He's an incredible man.

1505
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:07,880
Apparently, he taught history and military strategy in the capital.

1506
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:13,240
We met when I was looking for manuals on military doctrine.

1507
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,940
And we just really related well to each other.

1508
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:21,180
Just earlier, we were speaking about a particularly rare tome.

1509
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,120
And as you heard, she got a little excited.

1510
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:24,680
She got a little excited.

1511
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:26,700
I don't want to play this in November.

1512
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:27,120
I love it.

1513
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,830
I have some interest.

1514
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:55,050
I wasn't expecting so much romance.

1515
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,270
It's literally called Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

1516
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,230
I just think they forgot the definition.

1517
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:04,270
They just didn't realize they got the other definition of romance.

1518
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:11,330
They got confused on which romance it was.

1519
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,330
Bro, this man's hair.

1520
01:21:27,930 --> 01:21:32,050
Gel in ancient China goes hard.

1521
01:21:46,790 --> 01:21:49,030
Oh, we could read together?

1522
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,290
Read together?

1523
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,290
Read together?

1524
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:55,890
Yeah, wait.

1525
01:21:56,230 --> 01:21:59,030
I was like, yeah, let me...

1526
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:04,710
I'm sorry, bro.

1527
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:05,670
I'm sorry.

1528
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:12,790
Oh, I didn't mean to mess up the choice.

1529
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:14,410
I just thought it was funny.

1530
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:24,270
What did you mean?

1531
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:25,510
What do you mean me?

1532
01:22:29,030 --> 01:22:31,030
And let's study together.

1533
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:34,010
Oh my god, he's getting closer!

1534
01:22:39,150 --> 01:22:40,010
Yeah, friends.

1535
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:44,950
He took like a step closer and I got scared.

1536
01:22:45,530 --> 01:22:47,450
I was like, personal space.

1537
01:22:47,890 --> 01:22:48,450
Oh my god.

1538
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:49,850
My second Oshi.

1539
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:51,250
Cheng Liao.

1540
01:22:56,330 --> 01:22:58,550
They were also roommates.

1541
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:04,890
I'm afraid of commitment.

1542
01:23:08,260 --> 01:23:09,050
It's me!

1543
01:23:13,010 --> 01:23:15,250
Yeah, I killed you.

1544
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:21,700
Now that you mention it.

1545
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:28,760
Oh no, you fucking kicked my ass.

1546
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,800
Oh no, of course I did.

1547
01:23:39,980 --> 01:23:41,200
Oh wait, we're getting closer.

1548
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,360
No, don't leave!

1549
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:42,460
Leave!

1550
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:52,540
How big is your room when you have this many roommates?

1551
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,300
Enough for China.

1552
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,120
We're tired for all the generals in China.

1553
01:24:04,060 --> 01:24:05,820
I fight to help others.

1554
01:24:20,620 --> 01:24:21,820
Liu Bu?

1555
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:34,120
Liu Bu?

1556
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:39,280
Why do you serve Liu Bu?

1557
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:47,280
After all, he betrayed even the oath he swore with Dong Zhuo, his adoptive father.

1558
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:51,600
But Lord Liu Bu is the greatest warrior to have ever lived.

1559
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:53,260
Fighting under him is an honor.

1560
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,520
And I feel no shame in serving him.

1561
01:24:56,520 --> 01:24:59,960
I am committed to my lord and I would give my life for him.

1562
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,020
That is my purpose in life.

1563
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:05,960
Apologies.

1564
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:10,580
I have taken up too much of your time with my wayward children.

1565
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:13,380
But I have enjoyed this talk.

1566
01:25:13,860 --> 01:25:15,220
You have my thanks.

1567
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:20,880
As souls of the battlefield in this game, may we meet again.

1568
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:23,700
As allies or as enemies.

1569
01:25:24,580 --> 01:25:29,200
When that day comes, I will show you what I am capable of.

1570
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,560
I wish you well until then.

1571
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:41,980
Hmm.

1572
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:44,480
Alright.

1573
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:45,980
Twin Peaks.

1574
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,460
We will meet on the battlefield.

1575
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:49,940
Alright.

1576
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,900
There's more!

1577
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:53,340
I see you!

1578
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,040
I see you!

1579
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:56,580
Oh my god!

1580
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:00,740
There's so many people that want to talk to me!

1581
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:02,220
It's been snooping around here.

1582
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:11,190
Please!

1583
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:12,850
There's only one of me!

1584
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:13,090
There's only one of me!

1585
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:20,470
Who is this guy?

1586
01:26:22,070 --> 01:26:24,150
I recognize him.

1587
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:26,770
I don't remember which faction he's in though.

1588
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:31,640
A new one?

1589
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:53,060
No?

1590
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:57,740
No?

1591
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:58,160
Who are you?

1592
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:01,380
Who are you?

1593
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,060
Was this the guy?

1594
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,620
Oh, this is Oshie's squad.

1595
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:06,020
Oh!

1596
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,400
Oh!

1597
01:27:13,940 --> 01:27:15,120
Three streams ago!

1598
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:17,260
Oh my god, that's him three streams ago!

1599
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,300
That was like a month ago.

1600
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:22,740
What?

1601
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,640
Oh my god, wait.

1602
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,340
What the fuck?

1603
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:39,760
Wait, what?

1604
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:41,300
This isn't even Bro anymore.

1605
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,260
Wait...

1606
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:46,160
Wait...

1607
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:48,220
I think...guys...

1608
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:50,400
I don't think there was a no homo there.

1609
01:27:51,020 --> 01:27:51,580
I think...

1610
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,760
This is not just an Oshie anymore.

1611
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,420
Guys, he didn't end it with no homo!

1612
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,700
He didn't!

1613
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,300
That was real!

1614
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:09,040
Wait...

1615
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:11,700
I guess I can...

1616
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:17,080
Wait, you're not even here for me?

1617
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:25,120
He wasn't even here for me!

1618
01:28:28,420 --> 01:28:30,860
Bro, he wants my roommate!

1619
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:36,320
What?

1620
01:28:42,460 --> 01:28:44,960
Not everyone is here for you, Doki.

1621
01:28:46,760 --> 01:28:49,280
But I'm the main character!

1622
01:28:53,550 --> 01:28:54,290
Bro!

1623
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,870
He came over here to tell me he's not interested?

1624
01:28:58,670 --> 01:28:59,870
That's fucked.

1625
01:29:01,390 --> 01:29:02,950
That's so fucked.

1626
01:29:06,990 --> 01:29:08,490
I wanna take this.

1627
01:29:08,770 --> 01:29:09,430
Okay, who is she?

1628
01:29:10,630 --> 01:29:11,810
Wait, there's another woman!

1629
01:29:12,630 --> 01:29:13,490
Wait, who is she?

1630
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:19,790
Oh my god, the second- the third woman in this game!

1631
01:29:24,330 --> 01:29:25,130
Who is she?

1632
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:44,670
What?

1633
01:29:47,530 --> 01:29:48,090
Me?

1634
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:48,930
Why?

1635
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:50,430
Shouldn't you find your mate?

1636
01:29:52,770 --> 01:29:53,710
Wait, what?

1637
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:54,990
I don't recognize her.

1638
01:29:56,470 --> 01:29:58,230
Shouldn't you find your mate?

1639
01:29:58,410 --> 01:29:59,170
Yeah, that's right.

1640
01:29:59,310 --> 01:29:59,790
Begone!

1641
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,730
Oh my gosh, she Uno-reversed me.

1642
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:14,210
My lady, this area isn't exactly dangerous, but I don't advise walking alone.

1643
01:30:14,330 --> 01:30:18,130
It'd be best to rely on him for help.

1644
01:30:18,150 --> 01:30:18,790
He's a renowned warrior.

1645
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:22,590
Oh, is that right?

1646
01:30:23,250 --> 01:30:25,650
Then it seems my impression was not mistaken.

1647
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:30,990
Would you be so kind as to escort me then?

1648
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:34,670
I must give you a little reward.

1649
01:30:35,870 --> 01:30:37,450
Oh, a reward?

1650
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:40,710
Oh, my lady, say less.

1651
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:42,710
Did I accept?

1652
01:30:44,870 --> 01:30:47,130
Alright, do I accept her?

1653
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:50,770
Do I be a simp and accept, or be like, what about your mate?

1654
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:55,050
Fuck it, I accept.

1655
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:59,270
I'm grateful for your help.

1656
01:30:59,910 --> 01:31:01,550
Now, let's set off.

1657
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,290
A simp!

1658
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,470
I'm truly grateful for you today.

1659
01:31:19,310 --> 01:31:22,830
That was my first time fully exploring the town.

1660
01:31:23,010 --> 01:31:24,450
I thought I was escorting you!

1661
01:31:24,650 --> 01:31:25,950
Why are we...

1662
01:31:25,950 --> 01:31:27,250
Did you enjoy...

1663
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:29,030
Why did we explore?

1664
01:31:30,290 --> 01:31:32,750
I thought we were taking you home.

1665
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:34,850
That's a very nice man.

1666
01:31:34,970 --> 01:31:37,150
Now move, I'm here for the man.

1667
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:40,470
Mr. Stan, thank you for the super chat.

1668
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:41,290
Thank you, thank you.

1669
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:42,230
Did you enjoy it?

1670
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:43,990
Can we find your maid?

1671
01:31:44,490 --> 01:31:48,150
It truly feels like a stroke of luck to have met you.

1672
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:53,910
I am so very glad that I snuck out of our residence.

1673
01:31:56,030 --> 01:31:57,010
Snuck out?

1674
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,350
Wait, so there was no maid!

1675
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:03,490
Yes, it's as you suspect.

1676
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:06,610
I lied about being separated from my maid.

1677
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:07,290
Liar!

1678
01:32:07,290 --> 01:32:08,890
She lies about this.

1679
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:10,290
What else would she lie about?

1680
01:32:12,290 --> 01:32:14,070
Oh my gosh, she's like Jasmine.

1681
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,630
Oh, they're fucking rich as hell.

1682
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:23,030
You should.

1683
01:32:37,290 --> 01:32:41,910
The world is vast, with so much to see, and so much to adore.

1684
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:52,470
And yet, when I marry into the Yuan family, I will be in another cage, only more lavish than the one I am in now.

1685
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:54,830
Yeah, but do you not see all the gold that he wears?

1686
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:58,210
No, you don't want to go out there.

1687
01:32:58,290 --> 01:33:00,090
People are literally dying of starvation.

1688
01:33:00,390 --> 01:33:02,590
She does not know how bad it is out there.

1689
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:05,370
I saw drag queens fucking die in Kuala Lumpur.

1690
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:07,310
She doesn't fucking know.

1691
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:19,250
She's been living so sheltered and was like, oh man, I wish I could live out there where people are dying from starvation and poverty and are starting to cannibalize others.

1692
01:33:19,610 --> 01:33:22,550
Oh man, that's where I'm gonna be free.

1693
01:33:22,750 --> 01:33:25,210
You don't know what it's like out there.

1694
01:33:25,470 --> 01:33:28,250
I've been in non-stop war, ma'am.

1695
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:28,950
I...

1696
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:34,890
Oh my God.

1697
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:37,930
Call for me again if you'd like.

1698
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:51,010
We walked outside.

1699
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:56,190
Oh my God, that's Chen Ji?!

1700
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:02,210
Wait, isn't...

1701
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:05,810
Wait, that's Chen Ji?!

1702
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:08,230
No way!

1703
01:34:10,910 --> 01:34:14,070
I thought she'd be, she should be like younger!

1704
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:19,610
She's, she's Chow Chow's son's wife.

1705
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,310
She shouldn't be alive!

1706
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:24,430
Wait, no, she is supposed to be alive.

1707
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:27,090
But she's supposed to be like a child!

1708
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:40,030
I did not realize, I had a feeling it was uh, I had a feeling that was Chen Ji but I was like, no, she's wearing yellow.

1709
01:34:40,630 --> 01:34:45,550
Because like, you know, we saw Pang Tong wearing a green already, you know?

1710
01:34:46,090 --> 01:34:53,990
I saw, we saw Pang Tong uh, wearing green, so I was like, oh, okay, so they're all gonna be wearing their faction's colors.

1711
01:34:54,770 --> 01:35:04,670
And, and so like, seeing Chen Ji in white and yellow messed me up, cause I was like, cause like, Chen Ji always has the mole on her, like, underneath her right eye.

1712
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:07,750
So I was like, oh, that has to be Chen Ji, right?

1713
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:09,550
But then I was like, no, she's not wearing blue.

1714
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,130
But then like, I was like, oh man, okay.

1715
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:17,790
And also I was like, there's no way it's her, because like, she's supposed to be Chow P's wife.

1716
01:35:18,430 --> 01:35:20,070
So I was like, there's no way that's her.

1717
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:22,870
And then I was, and then now she's like, I'm Chen Ji.

1718
01:35:22,970 --> 01:35:34,890
And I was like, oh yeah, I forgot they aged everybody up and like, his, like, nothing is like, like, time is just, like, messy right now.

1719
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:39,210
Time is not a straight line at the moment.

1720
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:45,310
It's like everybody is somehow just in their late 20's for some fucking reason.

1721
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:48,650
Okay, I'm gonna use the bathroom, guys.

1722
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:49,710
I'll be right back.

1723
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:54,530
Like, time is relative.

1724
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:56,290
We don't know, it's all an illusion.

1725
01:35:56,490 --> 01:36:00,030
It's man-made.

1726
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:04,780
I'm back.

1727
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,540
But that's, it's so crazy.

1728
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,520
She's like, I wish I could be free.

1729
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:13,280
And I'm like, there's literally a famine going on right now in the middle of all this war.

1730
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:15,800
What the fuck do you mean you hate this life?

1731
01:37:15,940 --> 01:37:23,960
Like, anybody would trade their fucking, like, they would trade like, their arms and legs to be like you right now.

1732
01:37:26,060 --> 01:37:27,460
That's like crazy.

1733
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,720
Alright, let's see.

1734
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:34,400
She's kind of, yeah, just a little sheltered, guys.

1735
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,060
Just a little bit.

1736
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:39,520
How much more do I have to talk to?

1737
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,180
Alright, the silly province.

1738
01:37:42,480 --> 01:37:45,500
Alright, gotta go to the silly province real quick, guys.

1739
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:52,080
Alright, where's the silly province?

1740
01:37:53,220 --> 01:37:53,660
Shoot.

1741
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,200
Where is it?

1742
01:37:55,260 --> 01:37:57,080
Where's my favorite little silly guy?

1743
01:37:57,500 --> 01:37:58,460
Alright, there you go.

1744
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:01,980
Flaming, thank you for the super chat.

1745
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:02,860
Thank you, thank you.

1746
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,440
Oh, there you go.

1747
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:09,580
Alright.

1748
01:38:10,100 --> 01:38:12,160
Wait, do I have to do this?

1749
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:13,440
This mini one?

1750
01:38:13,540 --> 01:38:14,660
I'll just do this mini quest.

1751
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:20,240
Okay.

1752
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,760
Okay, just a general.

1753
01:38:22,060 --> 01:38:24,020
Oh my god, our first fight, guys!

1754
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:26,020
Oh my god!

1755
01:38:27,340 --> 01:38:29,980
Our fucking first fight, everybody!

1756
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,940
I actually sort of don't remember how to play, though.

1757
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,080
Like, this is a little bit...

1758
01:38:38,440 --> 01:38:38,920
Okay.

1759
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:40,420
Okay, it's fine.

1760
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,540
I figured it out.

1761
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,220
I figured it out.

1762
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,760
I just have to do this.

1763
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:49,640
There you go.

1764
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:52,820
Oh, nice!

1765
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:53,280
Counter!

1766
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:56,360
Oh my god, we did it!

1767
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:00,260
Okay.

1768
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:03,600
Okay, nice.

1769
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,840
And then we do our... Why, why, why, why, why?

1770
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,960
Jesus Christ, you're so fucking strong!

1771
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:13,980
Guys, at this rate, this is gonna be, like, this could be, like, the only fight we do at this point.

1772
01:39:14,900 --> 01:39:20,380
Imagine this is, like, our only fight we do because of...

1773
01:39:20,380 --> 01:39:23,400
Because we were stuck in a visual novel.

1774
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:28,100
For, like, almost two hours.

1775
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:30,720
Okay, nice.

1776
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:33,640
We did it.

1777
01:39:34,860 --> 01:39:36,660
You don't understand, it's the lore.

1778
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,600
Yay!

1779
01:39:40,660 --> 01:39:44,340
Oh, thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you!

1780
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:47,200
Guys, this is, like, literally the first fight I was in.

1781
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,280
I forgot about the gameplay.

1782
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:52,880
I was so locked in.

1783
01:39:58,550 --> 01:39:59,910
Okay, I did it.

1784
01:40:00,190 --> 01:40:00,850
I did the thing.

1785
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:04,290
Talk to me.

1786
01:40:04,410 --> 01:40:05,550
What the fuck?

1787
01:40:06,930 --> 01:40:07,770
What?

1788
01:40:07,770 --> 01:40:09,290
Was this not the quest?

1789
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:15,820
I did the wrong one.

1790
01:40:15,860 --> 01:40:18,420
I did the wrong one!

1791
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:21,520
This was what I was supposed to do!

1792
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:30,400
Quest, okay.

1793
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:32,500
Now I'm done.

1794
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,980
Now this is the right one.

1795
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,020
Oh my god.

1796
01:40:37,780 --> 01:40:40,360
How was I supposed to know?

1797
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,660
It was right next to him!

1798
01:40:45,700 --> 01:40:47,160
Okay, that's fine.

1799
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,560
I figured it out, guys.

1800
01:40:51,020 --> 01:40:52,860
Okay, this is the right guy.

1801
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:56,980
Alright, nice.

1802
01:40:58,780 --> 01:41:00,480
Okay, goodbye.

1803
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:02,720
We'll make it fast.

1804
01:41:03,940 --> 01:41:05,220
That's fucking right.

1805
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:06,080
Get over here.

1806
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:06,320
Get over here.

1807
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:09,440
Nice, okay.

1808
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:10,260
I still have the Y.

1809
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:10,900
That's good.

1810
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:13,880
Thank you for the super chat.

1811
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:14,460
Thank you.

1812
01:41:16,180 --> 01:41:18,300
Look, it just happens, okay?

1813
01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:25,800
Look, my brain was muddied by like the side quests, alright, guys?

1814
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,000
You can't blame me, alright?

1815
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:30,240
I got distracted by the side quests.

1816
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,660
Alright, we- Oh wait, there's more.

1817
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:37,280
There's a wise rebel general.

1818
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,860
Oh, he fucking missed.

1819
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,680
I got distracted, okay?

1820
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:48,480
I got distracted.

1821
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:50,840
It could happen to any of you!

1822
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:53,560
Okay, we did it.

1823
01:41:53,660 --> 01:41:56,560
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

1824
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:00,640
Looking rough.

1825
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:05,320
Alright, nice.

1826
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:09,200
Yay, we did it!

1827
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:16,810
Looking rough.

1828
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:19,270
Alright, now I did your thing.

1829
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:26,870
If I'm not mistaking, you must be- Ah, I suppose it would be rude to pry.

1830
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:35,790
Let's leave it at that for now, but someday, I'll very much enjoy the chance to learn more about you.

1831
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:37,230
Oh, okay.

1832
01:42:41,610 --> 01:42:45,770
Alright, where is the Lu Bu quest line?

1833
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:51,890
I have no idea where Lu Bu- Lu Bei's forces is.

1834
01:42:53,330 --> 01:42:54,750
Is this Lu Bei?

1835
01:42:54,850 --> 01:42:56,070
I wanna do Lu Bei's stuff.

1836
01:43:01,250 --> 01:43:02,370
Oh, that's Sun Jian.

1837
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:07,570
Wait, is there something here?

1838
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:09,670
Oh, there's a weapon shop!

1839
01:43:11,510 --> 01:43:12,430
Where am I at?

1840
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:13,190
I'm at 91.

1841
01:43:13,490 --> 01:43:15,050
Okay, I need, like, not weapon 91.

1842
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:18,750
Okay, uh...

1843
01:43:18,750 --> 01:43:23,330
That is Sun Jian's camp, so...

1844
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:25,050
Just follow the benevolence?

1845
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:26,950
But where is the benevolence?

1846
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,750
Okay, it's here.

1847
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:31,270
It's right here.

1848
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:35,370
This is Puyang Ping...

1849
01:43:35,370 --> 01:43:37,450
Okay, we'll go here, fast travel here.

1850
01:43:42,610 --> 01:43:45,390
Okay, one of these has to be...

1851
01:43:47,790 --> 01:43:49,110
Wait, which one's him?

1852
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:50,770
Is it this one?

1853
01:43:51,710 --> 01:43:54,310
I don't wanna accidentally do the wrong one.

1854
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:58,850
Okay, is it the one- no, that's blue, right?

1855
01:43:58,950 --> 01:43:59,950
That's green over there.

1856
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:01,110
Oh, there's green over there!

1857
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:01,910
Yeah, that's green.

1858
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:04,590
Yeah, I saw the colors.

1859
01:44:06,670 --> 01:44:07,810
Okay, there you go.

1860
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:08,730
That's blue bear.

1861
01:44:10,570 --> 01:44:12,770
If all else fails, look for the colors.

1862
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:18,900
Oh my god, guys, we're progressing the story.

1863
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:20,720
We're actually progressing.

1864
01:44:21,460 --> 01:44:22,840
Oh my god.

1865
01:44:24,420 --> 01:44:26,860
We're actually progressing, guys.

1866
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,990
Let's be the only fight we do today.

1867
01:44:35,970 --> 01:44:37,030
After all that.

1868
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,690
My apologies.

1869
01:44:39,490 --> 01:44:40,930
Oh my god, Guan Yun.

1870
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:42,350
Oh my god.

1871
01:44:43,530 --> 01:44:45,250
You seem quite taken aback.

1872
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:46,210
And the rest.

1873
01:44:46,850 --> 01:44:49,170
I admit, I haven't gotten used to this either.

1874
01:44:50,150 --> 01:44:57,050
Now that you're the governor, you must look, and more importantly, act the part, sir.

1875
01:44:57,090 --> 01:44:57,550
Oh my god.

1876
01:44:57,630 --> 01:44:58,990
Oh, he has his famous armor!

1877
01:44:59,930 --> 01:45:01,810
He finally has his Lupe armor!

1878
01:45:02,890 --> 01:45:03,990
Governor of Ping Yuan.

1879
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:05,670
Oh my god.

1880
01:45:09,190 --> 01:45:11,690
He's so benevolent and dreamy.

1881
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:21,710
Thank you for the super chat.

1882
01:45:21,790 --> 01:45:22,830
Thank you, thank you.

1883
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,850
War room with table meeting cutscene number 428.

1884
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:28,750
Thank you for the super chat.

1885
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:29,350
Thank you, thank you.

1886
01:45:41,020 --> 01:45:45,540
I was summoned here because we once again need your help.

1887
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:46,260
Yeah?

1888
01:45:47,560 --> 01:45:49,880
But I should explain the situation.

1889
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:55,080
First, what happened after we parted ways in Luoyang.

1890
01:45:56,640 --> 01:45:59,380
We returned to You province with Lord Gongsun Zan.

1891
01:46:00,900 --> 01:46:03,120
And I was appointed as governor of Ping Yuan.

1892
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:07,560
I think I'm doing a good job, if I do say so myself.

1893
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:11,240
My work has been praised by others.

1894
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,840
Your work or like your general's work?

1895
01:46:15,600 --> 01:46:16,660
Why are you doing well?

1896
01:46:16,780 --> 01:46:19,540
We have my brother to thank for all we've achieved.

1897
01:46:20,260 --> 01:46:23,660
Words of his deeds is beginning to spread across the land.

1898
01:46:24,520 --> 01:46:26,680
You shouldn't put me on such a pedestal, Guan Yu.

1899
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:32,760
We have only done as well as we have because of Lord Gongsun Zan's support.

1900
01:46:33,820 --> 01:46:40,240
As we speak, our benefactor is under attack from Yuan Shao in Ji province.

1901
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:42,840
I hear they're struggling.

1902
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,980
I'm sure they would appreciate our help.

1903
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:50,640
We owe a lot to Gongsun Zan.

1904
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:55,620
What worth is there in life if you forget the kindness shown to you?

1905
01:46:58,120 --> 01:47:05,600
However, now that Yuan Shao has gained a foothold in Ji, he may be stronger than when he led the coalition forces.

1906
01:47:06,220 --> 01:47:11,060
Meanwhile, our army is still at his feet.

1907
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:15,320
I just realized how short Liu Bei is.

1908
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:24,520
I mean, Guan Yu is known to be super fucking tall, but he's like a good meter taller than him.

1909
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:25,980
Short King.

1910
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:29,340
Him and Tata are the definition of Short King.

1911
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,160
Hello, baby man.

1912
01:47:43,450 --> 01:47:44,690
Yeah, is that fair?

1913
01:47:44,810 --> 01:47:46,930
Being like beside Guan Yu right now?

1914
01:47:47,030 --> 01:47:48,510
Oh my god, our first fight.

1915
01:47:49,190 --> 01:47:50,550
We're gonna do it.

1916
01:47:52,490 --> 01:47:52,990
88...

1917
01:47:52,990 --> 01:47:58,010
80... Okay, I wanna... Let's see what my actual objective... Okay, where's the Shao Dun objectives?

1918
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:01,210
Okay, charge strong attacks.

1919
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:03,410
Okay, battle arcs using the Pudao.

1920
01:48:03,530 --> 01:48:04,830
Okay, I just gotta...

1921
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:07,330
If I complete this, everything will be fine.

1922
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:09,390
Do I have the Pudao?

1923
01:48:11,050 --> 01:48:11,770
Where is it?

1924
01:48:11,790 --> 01:48:12,550
Oh, there it is.

1925
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:14,850
What's my strongest one though?

1926
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:16,110
Do I have a level 80?

1927
01:48:16,630 --> 01:48:18,490
I don't know if I have a level 80 one.

1928
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:22,970
Oh, I have a level 89.

1929
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:26,290
Alright, we're gonna try and do it with...

1930
01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:27,730
We're gonna try and do it with this.

1931
01:48:32,830 --> 01:48:34,910
Anybody look short next to Guan Yu.

1932
01:48:35,110 --> 01:48:36,430
Thank you for the super chat.

1933
01:48:36,430 --> 01:48:38,070
Thank you, thank you.

1934
01:48:38,410 --> 01:48:39,690
That's true though.

1935
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:40,970
That is very true.

1936
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:43,210
Rising.

1937
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:44,370
Thank you, thank you.

1938
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:46,930
Except for Lu Bu.

1939
01:48:48,690 --> 01:48:49,070
Alright.

1940
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:53,090
Alright, first...

1941
01:48:53,090 --> 01:48:54,890
It might be only battle we do today.

1942
01:48:55,750 --> 01:48:59,530
To progress the fight story.

1943
01:49:02,290 --> 01:49:03,970
Ninja, thank you for the super chat.

1944
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:04,810
Thank you, thank you.

1945
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:05,890
Guan Yu and Lu Bu.

1946
01:49:06,150 --> 01:49:07,550
It's just Tokyo, man.

1947
01:49:07,610 --> 01:49:08,550
Thank you for the super chat.

1948
01:49:08,630 --> 01:49:09,550
Thank you, thank you.

1949
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:12,170
Engage in combat at...

1950
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:14,850
Both forces are quite large, so the battle will likely be fierce.

1951
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:18,370
We need to help him, but we can't afford to do too much.

1952
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:21,250
If we lose you, brother, it will be all for nothing.

1953
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:27,430
You make a fair point, which is why I'll be grateful to have you all watching over both of us during this battle.

1954
01:49:28,150 --> 01:49:31,750
Judging by the formation, most of the fighting will be done in the center.

1955
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:36,270
Lord Guan Xun Zhang must want to break through their front line.

1956
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:42,990
They do have the cavalry on their side, such as an elite unit gives him a consistent advantage in a frontal assault.

1957
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:48,750
He has no doubt planning to use them to charge through enemy lines, which means we should probably back up their offensive.

1958
01:49:50,670 --> 01:49:51,030
Okay.

1959
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:55,210
But in hurrying their aid, we still have not seen a battlefield with our own eyes.

1960
01:49:56,870 --> 01:49:58,270
Our sister may yet elude us.

1961
01:49:58,350 --> 01:50:01,330
The gap in the enemy's central formation is especially suspicious.

1962
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:03,390
Oh, it has to be a trap.

1963
01:50:04,550 --> 01:50:05,730
That has to be a trap there.

1964
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:06,370
There's no way.

1965
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:07,830
Why would they just leave it empty?

1966
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:09,070
That's like a trap.

1967
01:50:09,070 --> 01:50:11,670
Like, I can see the trap from like 20 miles away.

1968
01:50:11,950 --> 01:50:13,090
Also, let me get water, guys.

1969
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:14,170
I forgot to do that.

1970
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:20,690
Fill my water before we go into our one and only fight after an hour of visual novels.

1971
01:50:50,050 --> 01:50:51,730
Alright, I got my water.

1972
01:50:52,610 --> 01:50:53,430
I'm ready.

1973
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:56,430
I'm ready to play the game.

1974
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:58,570
I'm ready.

1975
01:50:59,210 --> 01:50:59,830
I'm ready.

1976
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:02,670
That overlooks the battlefield.

1977
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:03,950
We'll see ourselves from there.

1978
01:51:05,230 --> 01:51:06,770
Okay, we should be going soon.

1979
01:51:06,930 --> 01:51:07,790
Alright, let's go.

1980
01:51:07,910 --> 01:51:09,390
Okay, I want Guan Yun.

1981
01:51:10,450 --> 01:51:11,250
Wait, no.

1982
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:15,230
Why the fuck would I pick Zhang Fei over fucking Guan Yun?

1983
01:51:15,890 --> 01:51:17,890
Guan Yun is literally the god of war.

1984
01:51:18,510 --> 01:51:20,830
Zhang Fei died from like...

1985
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:22,270
because he drank too much.

1986
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,630
Zhang Fei is an alcoholic.

1987
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:30,450
He died being known as an alcoholic while Guan Yun died and became a god of war.

1988
01:51:37,030 --> 01:51:37,710
Same.

1989
01:51:37,710 --> 01:51:38,210
Same.

1990
01:51:41,210 --> 01:51:42,110
Bro,

1991
01:51:52,310 --> 01:51:55,870
my grandma had a fucking shrine.

1992
01:51:56,270 --> 01:51:57,370
Like those like...

1993
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:58,690
What's it called?

1994
01:52:00,790 --> 01:52:03,690
You know like the shrine offerings and stuff?

1995
01:52:04,190 --> 01:52:09,950
She had a fucking shrine offering for fucking for fucking Guan Yun.

1996
01:52:10,210 --> 01:52:11,770
I know who's important here.

1997
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:16,610
Okay, nice.

1998
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:19,510
How do I use the strong attack again?

1999
01:52:20,370 --> 01:52:21,430
Oh, I found it.

2000
01:52:21,650 --> 01:52:22,430
I figured it out.

2001
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:34,670
I forgot like what exactly was like the benefit of offering doing offerings for Guan Yun.

2002
01:52:35,630 --> 01:52:36,190
Exactly.

2003
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:44,170
No, it's actually because he became like he became like an actual like god.

2004
01:52:45,830 --> 01:52:49,250
Because of like he got like ascended into godhood.

2005
01:52:50,070 --> 01:52:53,110
It's like regular for like...

2006
01:52:53,110 --> 01:52:54,250
Is it business success?

2007
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:55,550
Is it money?

2008
01:52:55,810 --> 01:52:57,030
I forgot what it was.

2009
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:01,670
But there's a reason for... Oh, I opened the door.

2010
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:04,050
Open the door!

2011
01:53:07,170 --> 01:53:07,950
Who is?

2012
01:53:08,830 --> 01:53:09,550
Zhao Yun?

2013
01:53:10,930 --> 01:53:13,830
Bro, you're supposed to be a fucking hero!

2014
01:53:15,310 --> 01:53:18,970
You literally have the fucking main character buff Zhao Yun.

2015
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:20,330
What do you mean?

2016
01:53:24,150 --> 01:53:24,470
Okay.

2017
01:53:28,350 --> 01:53:28,830
Okay.

2018
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:30,410
Yeah, and where's Zhang Fei's shrine?

2019
01:53:30,690 --> 01:53:31,390
That's right.

2020
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:33,010
Nowhere.

2021
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:36,410
Okay, nice.

2022
01:53:37,650 --> 01:53:38,830
Just gotta kill this guy.

2023
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:41,470
I don't know if I like this.

2024
01:53:41,670 --> 01:53:43,210
I don't like this weapon in general.

2025
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:45,730
I'm only doing it so that I can romance Zhao Yun.

2026
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:49,450
Look!

2027
01:53:50,650 --> 01:53:52,950
Look, I don't hide what the purpose was.

2028
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:55,970
I'm not gonna lie.

2029
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:59,090
Okay, nice.

2030
01:54:00,250 --> 01:54:01,070
Valor!

2031
01:54:02,730 --> 01:54:03,550
Look!

2032
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:08,630
I'm not gonna lie of my true purpose of trying to use this weapon.

2033
01:54:10,210 --> 01:54:11,030
Alright.

2034
01:54:11,370 --> 01:54:12,390
Almost done.

2035
01:54:13,570 --> 01:54:13,770
Nice.

2036
01:54:14,370 --> 01:54:15,190
Counter.

2037
01:54:15,190 --> 01:54:15,310
Okay.

2038
01:54:20,250 --> 01:54:20,710
Nice.

2039
01:54:22,650 --> 01:54:23,110
Easy.

2040
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:27,050
Okay, we gotta go this way.

2041
01:54:27,530 --> 01:54:29,230
Oh, they're ready to charge so we gotta help them.

2042
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:47,230
Oh my god.

2043
01:54:47,290 --> 01:54:49,370
Zhao Yun has found an Oshi right now.

2044
01:55:02,950 --> 01:55:04,670
What if I just move forward?

2045
01:55:04,890 --> 01:55:06,930
What if I trigger the ambush right now?

2046
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:10,910
That is so fucked!

2047
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:14,610
I just triggered the ambush while they're in the middle of talking.

2048
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:24,670
Alright, nice.

2049
01:55:29,790 --> 01:55:30,970
Do I do this again?

2050
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:37,410
I DRAGONS FIRE!

2051
01:55:42,310 --> 01:55:44,190
I DRAGONS FIRE!

2052
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:47,250
Oh, I fucked it up.

2053
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:48,470
Whoops.

2054
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:49,830
Sorry guys.

2055
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:53,850
I fucked up our charge!

2056
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:56,830
Because I sent in arrows too late.

2057
01:55:57,330 --> 01:55:57,450
Whoops.

2058
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,430
My bad.

2059
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:04,850
I fucked up our charge, guys.

2060
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:08,330
Oh!

2061
01:56:09,490 --> 01:56:10,790
I messed up!

2062
01:56:11,070 --> 01:56:12,490
I messed up the plan!

2063
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:18,290
Sorry, instructions were definitely unclear for me.

2064
01:56:18,830 --> 01:56:20,910
What exactly what he wanted.

2065
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:23,210
That's my bad.

2066
01:56:24,730 --> 01:56:26,250
I take full blame in that.

2067
01:56:28,670 --> 01:56:29,230
Oh, shit!

2068
01:56:31,090 --> 01:56:31,510
Nice.

2069
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:37,550
Forgive you, commander!

2070
01:56:39,150 --> 01:56:39,490
Whoops.

2071
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:44,570
Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.

2072
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:47,470
Sorry, that was my fault.

2073
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:53,710
That was absolutely my fault.

2074
01:56:54,730 --> 01:56:56,390
I fucked it up.

2075
01:57:01,510 --> 01:57:05,070
The moment cost you your place in... Oh, shit!

2076
01:57:05,190 --> 01:57:06,910
I have no bug slash?!

2077
01:57:07,380 --> 01:57:08,650
Oh, give me a sec!

2078
01:57:08,710 --> 01:57:09,630
I'll be right back.

2079
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:13,950
Oh, fuck.

2080
01:57:14,070 --> 01:57:14,370
Okay.

2081
01:57:14,490 --> 01:57:15,810
Sorry, I fucked it up.

2082
01:57:16,670 --> 01:57:18,150
I was not paying attention.

2083
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:22,430
Oh, shit.

2084
01:57:22,530 --> 01:57:23,810
Let me get some buns real quick.

2085
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:25,870
I didn't even realize I used up all my buns.

2086
01:57:25,870 --> 01:57:25,950
Buns!

2087
01:57:29,790 --> 01:57:31,810
Guys, professional general here?

2088
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:36,050
Okay.

2089
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:38,930
Okay, that's five.

2090
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:41,250
Tactical retreat, guys.

2091
01:57:47,850 --> 01:57:49,390
Okay, we gotta kill this guy.

2092
01:57:50,110 --> 01:57:50,750
No, no, no!

2093
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:51,550
You're not kill stealing!

2094
01:57:51,690 --> 01:57:53,870
I spent so much trying to kill this guy!

2095
01:57:56,170 --> 01:57:56,730
Nice!

2096
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:58,930
Oh my god!

2097
01:57:59,110 --> 01:57:59,510
Oh, shit!

2098
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:06,010
Jesus Christ!

2099
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:08,010
I spent so long trying to kill this guy!

2100
01:58:10,330 --> 01:58:10,890
Nice!

2101
01:58:14,390 --> 01:58:17,890
Oh, fuck.

2102
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,210
Okay.

2103
01:58:19,570 --> 01:58:21,710
Let's get the...

2104
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:24,230
We need to go grab the house real quick.

2105
01:58:24,470 --> 01:58:25,310
Grab the fort back.

2106
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:27,790
I'll grab here first.

2107
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:33,250
Okay, how much more do I have to do for Chahut?

2108
01:58:33,450 --> 01:58:33,710
Okay.

2109
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:36,970
Okay, completed that.

2110
01:58:37,990 --> 01:58:40,270
I just need to do the charge attack thing.

2111
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:43,610
Alright, get over here!

2112
01:58:44,730 --> 01:58:46,170
Let me swap weapons first.

2113
01:58:46,770 --> 01:58:47,050
No!

2114
01:58:49,630 --> 01:58:50,190
Wait!

2115
01:58:50,190 --> 01:58:52,750
Wait, I'm not good with this weapon!

2116
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:53,610
No!

2117
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:57,630
Let me swap my weapon in this 1v1!

2118
01:58:57,770 --> 01:58:58,370
Okay, nice.

2119
01:58:58,470 --> 01:59:01,630
Okay, I'm glad he lets me swap my weapons in this 1v1.

2120
01:59:01,770 --> 01:59:03,530
I really appreciate that.

2121
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:06,190
In the middle of the 1v1, like...

2122
01:59:07,050 --> 01:59:07,810
Too late!

2123
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,110
Oh my god!

2124
01:59:10,230 --> 01:59:12,030
Thank god he lets me swap it.

2125
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:14,750
In the middle of 1v1ing.

2126
01:59:17,510 --> 01:59:18,210
There we go.

2127
01:59:18,930 --> 01:59:21,930
Oh my god, it's like I actually know how to use this weapon.

2128
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:24,070
It's like...

2129
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:24,870
Give me a sec!

2130
01:59:25,630 --> 01:59:27,410
I gotta use this real quick!

2131
01:59:31,290 --> 01:59:32,450
I'm just like...

2132
01:59:32,450 --> 01:59:32,670
Men!

2133
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:36,150
Men, pass me my actual weapon!

2134
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:42,810
There we go.

2135
01:59:44,330 --> 01:59:45,670
That should be done now.

2136
01:59:46,770 --> 01:59:48,730
Okay, and then we get our fort back.

2137
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:55,970
Alright, nice.

2138
01:59:58,630 --> 01:59:59,430
Get out of here!

2139
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:06,390
Oh shit, a lot of people are dying right now.

2140
02:00:06,510 --> 02:00:07,070
That is bad.

2141
02:00:07,430 --> 02:00:08,450
That is bad.

2142
02:00:10,150 --> 02:00:11,650
Look, this is very important!

2143
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:12,650
You don't understand!

2144
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:17,570
You don't understand!

2145
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:22,950
Okay, nice.

2146
02:00:23,930 --> 02:00:27,490
Wait, are we not claiming the base back yet?

2147
02:00:29,270 --> 02:00:30,830
This is for Shaohun Dun!

2148
02:00:30,890 --> 02:00:31,870
You don't understand!

2149
02:00:34,730 --> 02:00:36,150
I need this!

2150
02:00:37,190 --> 02:00:39,290
Okay, have I completed yet?

2151
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:41,030
Nice, okay, now I'm free.

2152
02:00:42,030 --> 02:00:42,810
Now I'm free.

2153
02:00:44,130 --> 02:00:45,470
Oh shit, that's not what I wanted.

2154
02:00:47,570 --> 02:00:48,790
I'm back to this.

2155
02:00:49,710 --> 02:00:50,810
Okay, now we actually...

2156
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:54,530
Okay, who do we...

2157
02:00:57,330 --> 02:01:00,390
Okay, we gotta help these guys over there.

2158
02:01:04,430 --> 02:01:05,490
Yeah, I wanna help.

2159
02:01:06,250 --> 02:01:07,390
But how do I get there?

2160
02:01:09,210 --> 02:01:10,550
Okay, we gotta get this base.

2161
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:11,850
Zhang Fei, please.

2162
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:14,850
This is why you're not remembered in history, Zhang Fei.

2163
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:18,690
Okay, nice.

2164
02:01:21,150 --> 02:01:24,050
Bro, Zhang Fei, how the fuck did you lose to them?

2165
02:01:26,310 --> 02:01:29,070
I just finished killing all of them!

2166
02:01:33,290 --> 02:01:34,370
Okay, nice.

2167
02:01:38,010 --> 02:01:38,650
Nice.

2168
02:01:38,750 --> 02:01:38,970
Nice, alright.

2169
02:01:46,830 --> 02:01:47,850
That's right!

2170
02:01:48,010 --> 02:01:51,350
Oh my god, behold your fucking power!

2171
02:01:52,730 --> 02:01:54,650
Nice, we did it.

2172
02:01:56,150 --> 02:01:56,590
Counter.

2173
02:01:59,630 --> 02:01:59,950
Okay.

2174
02:02:00,730 --> 02:02:03,490
Oh my god, this game gets so much easier when I can actually...

2175
02:02:04,150 --> 02:02:07,290
When I'm using a weapon I actually know how to use.

2176
02:02:07,910 --> 02:02:08,870
Holy shit.

2177
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:12,650
How is there more?

2178
02:02:13,190 --> 02:02:13,930
Okay, fuck it.

2179
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:14,550
Let's go duel.

2180
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:17,210
Let's duel.

2181
02:02:19,170 --> 02:02:19,650
Where?

2182
02:02:19,990 --> 02:02:20,610
Where is he?

2183
02:02:22,590 --> 02:02:23,670
What am I dueling with?

2184
02:02:28,330 --> 02:02:28,970
That bugged out?

2185
02:02:29,430 --> 02:02:30,470
What am I dueling with?

2186
02:02:30,970 --> 02:02:31,450
You?

2187
02:02:31,810 --> 02:02:33,050
Wait, you don't want to duel anymore?

2188
02:02:34,690 --> 02:02:36,230
You don't want to fight anymore?

2189
02:02:36,410 --> 02:02:37,310
I literally...

2190
02:02:37,310 --> 02:02:38,030
Oh my god.

2191
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:41,250
I can't believe it.

2192
02:02:43,210 --> 02:02:45,850
I can't believe he didn't want to duel with me anymore.

2193
02:02:46,170 --> 02:02:47,190
That's so fucked.

2194
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:48,730
Did I cancel it?

2195
02:02:48,870 --> 02:02:49,190
What?

2196
02:02:49,790 --> 02:02:50,630
Oh, I must have...

2197
02:02:50,630 --> 02:02:51,170
That's an accident.

2198
02:02:52,530 --> 02:02:53,850
That was actually an accident.

2199
02:02:53,970 --> 02:02:56,110
I did not mean to cancel the duel.

2200
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:57,610
Fuck it, let's go.

2201
02:03:00,610 --> 02:03:02,330
He didn't want to...

2202
02:03:02,330 --> 02:03:03,350
Alright, he came back.

2203
02:03:03,450 --> 02:03:03,830
That's good.

2204
02:03:04,230 --> 02:03:05,590
That's fucking right.

2205
02:03:05,650 --> 02:03:07,530
You're gonna start it off with that?

2206
02:03:08,110 --> 02:03:08,550
Buddy!

2207
02:03:09,510 --> 02:03:11,870
That was so predictable, buddy.

2208
02:03:13,510 --> 02:03:17,210
I can't believe you started out with that as your duel.

2209
02:03:19,010 --> 02:03:20,350
Oh my god.

2210
02:03:20,490 --> 02:03:24,370
Embarrassing yourself in front of your entire men like that?

2211
02:03:24,570 --> 02:03:25,690
Get fucking...

2212
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:26,350
Get down.

2213
02:03:27,230 --> 02:03:28,110
Get down.

2214
02:03:28,910 --> 02:03:30,150
That's fucking right.

2215
02:03:31,870 --> 02:03:32,850
That's fucking right.

2216
02:03:32,870 --> 02:03:34,290
I'm gonna take my fort back too.

2217
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:36,430
I'm gonna take it back.

2218
02:03:37,270 --> 02:03:40,390
I'm gonna back my house.

2219
02:03:41,150 --> 02:03:42,290
God damn it, John Fenn.

2220
02:03:42,350 --> 02:03:44,210
You lost to this, John Fenn?

2221
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:47,870
How did you lose to this?

2222
02:03:49,610 --> 02:03:51,070
Oh my god, go...

2223
02:03:51,070 --> 02:03:52,650
Is that what Fenn even held his own?

2224
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:55,390
Come on, buddy.

2225
02:03:58,010 --> 02:03:59,130
Come on.

2226
02:03:59,210 --> 02:04:01,830
Even Lu Bei got his shot.

2227
02:04:04,650 --> 02:04:05,450
Nice, we got it back.

2228
02:04:06,710 --> 02:04:07,150
Nice.

2229
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:10,170
Oh my god, and he killed two!

2230
02:04:11,030 --> 02:04:12,110
He got a twofer!

2231
02:04:13,370 --> 02:04:14,150
John Fenn.

2232
02:04:14,450 --> 02:04:16,010
God damn it, John Fenn.

2233
02:04:16,970 --> 02:04:19,250
This is why everyone wants you.

2234
02:04:19,310 --> 02:04:20,350
You can solo.

2235
02:04:22,030 --> 02:04:24,250
He's actually holding his own.

2236
02:04:24,490 --> 02:04:25,230
That's crazy.

2237
02:04:25,670 --> 02:04:29,850
Okay, before we get to Dao Yun, let's just help Lu Bei real quick on the side.

2238
02:04:32,190 --> 02:04:34,270
Alright, Lu Bei, don't worry, I got you.

2239
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:37,650
Don't worry.

2240
02:04:38,650 --> 02:04:40,150
Wait, they're all dead.

2241
02:04:41,810 --> 02:04:44,390
Wait, there's no one else in...

2242
02:04:44,390 --> 02:04:46,730
Wait, he killed everybody.

2243
02:04:47,630 --> 02:04:48,470
Oh wait, there they are.

2244
02:04:48,470 --> 02:04:50,310
I was like, where are they?

2245
02:04:51,790 --> 02:04:54,790
I was like, where's the rest of the people?

2246
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:58,010
I was like, wait, what?

2247
02:04:58,150 --> 02:04:58,770
Did you die?

2248
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:01,370
Alright, here we go.

2249
02:05:02,030 --> 02:05:02,490
Let's start.

2250
02:05:05,910 --> 02:05:06,770
Let's go.

2251
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:10,190
For Doki!

2252
02:05:11,790 --> 02:05:13,550
Before we get ambushed.

2253
02:05:13,730 --> 02:05:15,730
Oh wait, we don't get ambushed?

2254
02:05:15,730 --> 02:05:17,610
Oh shit.

2255
02:05:21,230 --> 02:05:23,010
Oh no.

2256
02:05:23,770 --> 02:05:26,110
Wait, I have an idea.

2257
02:05:30,530 --> 02:05:31,510
This is it.

2258
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:35,290
It's time.

2259
02:05:35,970 --> 02:05:39,350
It's time for the real game now.

2260
02:05:40,270 --> 02:05:42,330
That's fucking right.

2261
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:43,570
Where are you?

2262
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:47,850
It's time to play the game for real.

2263
02:05:51,290 --> 02:05:52,650
That's right.

2264
02:05:53,290 --> 02:05:54,890
Get down.

2265
02:05:55,770 --> 02:05:58,110
We're playing the game for real now.

2266
02:05:59,090 --> 02:06:02,490
That's why your grandma prays to me.

2267
02:06:05,850 --> 02:06:07,430
This is right.

2268
02:06:09,190 --> 02:06:13,210
Millions of people pray for me for this reason.

2269
02:06:15,390 --> 02:06:17,010
That's fucking right.

2270
02:06:18,630 --> 02:06:23,050
Oh my god, that's so fucking embarrassing for you.

2271
02:06:24,490 --> 02:06:28,530
If you really think you can fucking kill me.

2272
02:06:31,530 --> 02:06:33,630
That's right, get out of here.

2273
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:37,550
Oh yeah, that was a mistake for you.

2274
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:37,770
Oh.

2275
02:06:40,150 --> 02:06:40,910
Nice.

2276
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:47,910
I don't know what you're feeding him, but damn, he's fucking big.

2277
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:55,180
That's why he ascended into godhood.

2278
02:06:57,220 --> 02:06:58,580
Yes, we did it.

2279
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:05,200
That's literally like one of the reasons why he was just that good.

2280
02:07:05,880 --> 02:07:07,880
He eats freaks too.

2281
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,360
Wait, I can do this again?

2282
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:16,700
You know what?

2283
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:18,200
I believe in you guys.

2284
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:20,960
Alright, send your arrows.

2285
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:21,740
Alright, standby.

2286
02:07:24,680 --> 02:07:26,380
Go send your arrows in.

2287
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:28,560
There you go.

2288
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:32,200
What the fuck, am I injured?

2289
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:33,360
What do you think?

2290
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:36,320
Bro, I had three people on my ass.

2291
02:07:36,740 --> 02:07:37,800
Yes, I'm injured.

2292
02:07:38,320 --> 02:07:41,220
Like, what do you mean am I injured?

2293
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:46,580
Holy shit.

2294
02:07:46,900 --> 02:07:49,420
There's like three people on me right now.

2295
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:53,180
Oh my god.

2296
02:07:56,580 --> 02:07:58,160
I'm trying to figure out where people are.

2297
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:00,880
There's too many people.

2298
02:08:05,180 --> 02:08:06,340
Oh my god.

2299
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,380
Where?

2300
02:08:08,040 --> 02:08:09,180
I can't tell.

2301
02:08:10,680 --> 02:08:11,800
There's so many.

2302
02:08:12,060 --> 02:08:13,220
There's so many!

2303
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:16,360
What the fuck is going on?

2304
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:19,080
I need to go.

2305
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:21,320
I need to go.

2306
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:23,580
Oh my god, please!

2307
02:08:24,380 --> 02:08:24,700
Please!

2308
02:08:27,120 --> 02:08:28,420
Holy shit!

2309
02:08:31,580 --> 02:08:32,840
Oh my god.

2310
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:34,040
Oh my god, I lived.

2311
02:08:34,980 --> 02:08:35,820
Oh my god, where?

2312
02:08:36,280 --> 02:08:37,200
What's going on?

2313
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:41,940
What the fuck?

2314
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:43,520
What's going on?

2315
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:47,060
Oh my god, just challenge me.

2316
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:47,700
Please.

2317
02:08:49,300 --> 02:08:50,540
Just challenge me.

2318
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,180
It'd just be easier.

2319
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:58,780
It'll actually be easier if you all just challenge me.

2320
02:08:58,800 --> 02:08:59,080
Please.

2321
02:09:04,200 --> 02:09:05,840
Oh my god, I'm DJing.

2322
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:10,280
Okay, guys, guys, I actually have to go.

2323
02:09:13,020 --> 02:09:14,220
Oh my god.

2324
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:15,780
Like, I'm scared.

2325
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,820
I am so scared right now.

2326
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:19,940
I'm actually I'm so scared.

2327
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,400
Okay, that's okay.

2328
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:27,740
Alright, now it's just a... Now this isn't even fair anymore for him.

2329
02:09:28,060 --> 02:09:29,020
Oh, thank god.

2330
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:33,860
Thank god, now we're all just... Oh my god, that's crazy.

2331
02:09:34,280 --> 02:09:36,180
That is actually crazy.

2332
02:09:36,620 --> 02:09:38,900
Oh, that was so scary, guys.

2333
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:42,640
Alright, yeah, you go help out.

2334
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:46,820
I was living by a fucking thread.

2335
02:09:47,040 --> 02:09:48,220
I don't know how I survived.

2336
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:51,840
The mosh pit.

2337
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:55,160
That was actually a mosh pit right there.

2338
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:56,840
Holy fuck.

2339
02:09:56,840 --> 02:09:59,140
You fought well, honorable foe.

2340
02:09:59,720 --> 02:10:01,200
I was like, where am I?

2341
02:10:03,240 --> 02:10:05,540
Holy shit, that was fucking scary.

2342
02:10:08,500 --> 02:10:08,980
Nice.

2343
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:09,840
Yay!

2344
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:14,440
Oh my god, I get to talk to Xiaodong again.

2345
02:10:15,600 --> 02:10:16,420
My god.

2346
02:10:17,700 --> 02:10:18,460
Alright, let's see.

2347
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:19,440
Did we upgrade all of this?

2348
02:10:19,500 --> 02:10:20,040
Alright, we did.

2349
02:10:20,640 --> 02:10:22,320
Okay, I need to hold more items.

2350
02:10:23,220 --> 02:10:26,820
I'll... Enables you to perform an extreme musou attack?

2351
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:28,940
What the fuck is extreme musou?

2352
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:32,280
Guess we'll find out soon.

2353
02:10:40,420 --> 02:10:42,120
Can't wait to talk to Xiaodong.

2354
02:11:00,580 --> 02:11:01,980
Him?!

2355
02:11:03,820 --> 02:11:05,340
Thanks to him?!

2356
02:11:05,340 --> 02:11:06,760
What about me?!

2357
02:11:12,340 --> 02:11:14,400
I only did what any soldier would do.

2358
02:11:15,300 --> 02:11:21,960
I am simply happy to know that I managed to assist a man of such valor.

2359
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,760
Where is me in this casine?

2360
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:29,240
Why is this happening without me?

2361
02:11:38,480 --> 02:11:40,000
Where am I?

2362
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,200
You've earned it after such a battle.

2363
02:11:44,800 --> 02:11:45,500
Farewell then.

2364
02:11:47,960 --> 02:11:51,900
This is the first time they have a cutscene without- No, there's the one where they murder Dong Zhuo.

2365
02:11:52,080 --> 02:11:52,480
I forgot.

2366
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:58,340
Oh wow, he has an oshi now.

2367
02:12:04,060 --> 02:12:04,860
He's hooked.

2368
02:12:05,060 --> 02:12:05,900
He found an oshi.

2369
02:12:11,350 --> 02:12:15,190
He's trying to take my fourth brother's I'm not that whore!

2370
02:12:17,050 --> 02:12:19,430
I'm the fourth sworn brother!

2371
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:38,210
Okay.

2372
02:12:43,550 --> 02:12:45,390
More Myers?

2373
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:46,390
Of course.

2374
02:12:55,950 --> 02:12:57,890
Your brother- Huh?

2375
02:13:03,470 --> 02:13:04,870
What is he doing here?

2376
02:13:07,470 --> 02:13:08,650
You're supposed to be with Cao Cao.

2377
02:13:08,770 --> 02:13:09,210
We're blue.

2378
02:13:09,690 --> 02:13:11,830
What are you doing here in green territory?

2379
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:18,600
This is a green lands for you, bluey!

2380
02:13:32,260 --> 02:13:33,580
Time is relative.

2381
02:13:33,880 --> 02:13:36,240
Everything is not in the correct order right now.

2382
02:13:42,540 --> 02:13:45,680
You're in the wrong neighborhood, bluey.

2383
02:13:57,860 --> 02:14:02,840
If we mobilized immediately, we would suffer severe losses.

2384
02:14:04,180 --> 02:14:06,820
And then we might struggle to defend our own land.

2385
02:14:08,040 --> 02:14:09,360
There's reason to that.

2386
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,020
However, you would discard all compassion when faced with logic.

2387
02:14:15,820 --> 02:14:17,720
And, if I said I would.

2388
02:14:18,640 --> 02:14:22,480
Well then, Lord Kang Chong and the others are doomed to die.

2389
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:24,740
Yeah, but then we're doomed to die.

2390
02:14:24,740 --> 02:14:30,040
You can't just fucking go in there and talk about virtue and benevolence to Lupe.

2391
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:31,200
You know how he gets.

2392
02:14:32,680 --> 02:14:34,880
Oh my god, he pulled a virtue card.

2393
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:36,340
That's fucked.

2394
02:14:38,380 --> 02:14:39,560
That's so fucked.

2395
02:14:48,860 --> 02:14:52,020
Every time you pull a virtue card, you can't say no.

2396
02:14:56,560 --> 02:14:58,500
He's killed true Tim.

2397
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:17,640
I look tired.

2398
02:15:18,180 --> 02:15:20,160
That's been my life the last year.

2399
02:15:24,900 --> 02:15:26,140
I also did a stream.

2400
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:27,040
I started a stream.

2401
02:15:27,200 --> 02:15:29,920
Every 1230 stream is how I am right now.

2402
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:35,040
Alright, battle Kong Rong and Lupe forces versus the- Okay, Lupe.

2403
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:38,480
How good are you at visit?

2404
02:15:39,020 --> 02:15:41,760
I'm very far too much to do and not enough hands to go around.

2405
02:15:42,880 --> 02:15:44,760
You're not the type to let a man down, right?

2406
02:15:45,220 --> 02:15:47,480
Rescued at the hands of Lupe.

2407
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:48,800
This one?

2408
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:49,640
What is this?

2409
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:51,340
I can't be that bad.

2410
02:15:54,740 --> 02:15:55,700
Can I go to Lupe now?

2411
02:16:00,430 --> 02:16:01,170
Is it possible?

2412
02:16:01,610 --> 02:16:03,470
Okay, let's do this quest real quick.

2413
02:16:03,710 --> 02:16:03,990
We're in.

2414
02:16:04,950 --> 02:16:07,470
Help the peasants reach the escape point.

2415
02:16:07,570 --> 02:16:08,030
Where are they?

2416
02:16:08,090 --> 02:16:08,850
Are they following me?

2417
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:09,770
Are these the peasants?

2418
02:16:10,130 --> 02:16:11,650
Why do these peasants have weapons?

2419
02:16:14,430 --> 02:16:21,110
Okay, is there anyone I wanna- Is there anyone that I wanna- Okay, defeat strong enemies with a spear.

2420
02:16:22,050 --> 02:16:22,850
Okay, you know what?

2421
02:16:22,930 --> 02:16:26,010
Since like- Since we're here.

2422
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:28,030
What the fuck?

2423
02:16:28,270 --> 02:16:30,310
God Ning wants me to do four different things?

2424
02:16:30,690 --> 02:16:30,990
Okay.

2425
02:16:32,070 --> 02:16:33,230
Alright, fuck it.

2426
02:16:33,550 --> 02:16:38,250
Since we're here, we might as well get the God Ning objective.

2427
02:16:43,090 --> 02:16:43,410
Alright.

2428
02:16:46,750 --> 02:16:47,770
Alright, here we go.

2429
02:16:48,430 --> 02:16:50,610
Alright, peasants, are you okay now?

2430
02:16:52,790 --> 02:16:54,510
Wait, the peasants- Oh, shit!

2431
02:16:54,710 --> 02:16:55,190
Oh, fuck.

2432
02:16:55,330 --> 02:16:55,850
Oh, they are.

2433
02:16:56,570 --> 02:16:57,630
Oh, fuck, they are.

2434
02:16:57,750 --> 02:16:59,230
Okay, I thought I was guiding them.

2435
02:16:59,370 --> 02:16:59,870
Wait, what?

2436
02:17:00,690 --> 02:17:03,370
How do I- Wait, what?

2437
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:05,070
Oh, I went the wrong way.

2438
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:06,250
Oh my god, please live.

2439
02:17:06,670 --> 02:17:07,630
I went the wrong way.

2440
02:17:09,590 --> 02:17:09,950
What?

2441
02:17:10,910 --> 02:17:11,270
Sorry.

2442
02:17:12,070 --> 02:17:13,770
Sorry, I went the wrong way, guys.

2443
02:17:15,650 --> 02:17:16,470
Oh my god.

2444
02:17:16,530 --> 02:17:18,390
Okay, well, we're saving the peasants.

2445
02:17:18,390 --> 02:17:22,910
Okay, as long as one peasant is alive, everything will be fine, guys.

2446
02:17:23,170 --> 02:17:24,290
Oh, fuck!

2447
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:24,790
Oh!

2448
02:17:25,090 --> 02:17:26,350
Oh my god!

2449
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:28,110
Don't worry, I got you, peasant!

2450
02:17:28,430 --> 02:17:29,430
I got you!

2451
02:17:30,230 --> 02:17:31,670
Oh, that's awkward.

2452
02:17:32,370 --> 02:17:33,750
That was awkward.

2453
02:17:35,550 --> 02:17:37,210
It's okay, he's still alive.

2454
02:17:40,350 --> 02:17:42,230
It's okay, they're still okay.

2455
02:17:45,350 --> 02:17:46,030
Nice.

2456
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:48,870
Nice.

2457
02:17:49,710 --> 02:17:51,530
I don't like this fear right now.

2458
02:17:52,010 --> 02:17:52,510
This fear.

2459
02:17:54,430 --> 02:17:55,630
He ate his bread, guys.

2460
02:17:55,730 --> 02:17:56,270
He's fine.

2461
02:17:57,190 --> 02:17:58,030
He ate his bread.

2462
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:02,610
Nice.

2463
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:04,090
Countered.

2464
02:18:07,290 --> 02:18:08,430
Come on, come on.

2465
02:18:10,810 --> 02:18:12,590
Oh, fuck, I didn't counter that, though.

2466
02:18:14,050 --> 02:18:15,390
Okay, I countered that.

2467
02:18:15,390 --> 02:18:16,370
Jesus Christ.

2468
02:18:17,990 --> 02:18:20,170
Jesus Christ, I'm not countering anything!

2469
02:18:21,670 --> 02:18:23,150
He's so strong!

2470
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:27,030
It's fine, I have bread.

2471
02:18:28,030 --> 02:18:29,970
Oh, he's so fucking strong!

2472
02:18:31,810 --> 02:18:33,330
How can I get a little bit here?

2473
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:35,530
Okay, nice.

2474
02:18:37,430 --> 02:18:38,570
Nice, alright, got him.

2475
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:43,390
Alright, he'll be fine now.

2476
02:18:46,870 --> 02:18:47,350
Okay.

2477
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:49,570
Okay, so where do we take him?

2478
02:18:51,170 --> 02:18:52,310
Where's the escape point?

2479
02:18:52,370 --> 02:18:53,430
Okay, come with me, come with me.

2480
02:18:53,510 --> 02:18:54,470
It's literally right here.

2481
02:18:55,690 --> 02:18:56,170
Wait.

2482
02:18:59,090 --> 02:18:59,930
What are you doing?

2483
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:00,610
Why are you scared?

2484
02:19:01,370 --> 02:19:02,390
Come on, go!

2485
02:19:02,850 --> 02:19:03,190
Go!

2486
02:19:03,370 --> 02:19:05,390
It's literally right—it's right here?!

2487
02:19:06,610 --> 02:19:07,030
Bro!

2488
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:08,190
Okay.

2489
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:10,010
He could've just ran.

2490
02:19:12,350 --> 02:19:13,990
It's like right here!

2491
02:19:15,390 --> 02:19:15,790
Hello!

2492
02:19:17,590 --> 02:19:20,050
Alright, we did it.

2493
02:19:21,010 --> 02:19:22,410
We saved this guy.

2494
02:19:23,290 --> 02:19:23,550
Okay.

2495
02:19:25,110 --> 02:19:26,250
I got...

2496
02:19:26,250 --> 02:19:27,510
six out of that.

2497
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:28,690
Oh, okay, that's cool.

2498
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:30,430
And then—oh, wait, no!

2499
02:19:30,530 --> 02:19:32,470
Okay, 43, 6...

2500
02:19:32,470 --> 02:19:35,590
I mean, ah, it's almost there.

2501
02:19:36,030 --> 02:19:37,130
We're almost there.

2502
02:19:40,210 --> 02:19:42,190
We saved the one guy.

2503
02:19:43,030 --> 02:19:44,230
We did it, Lube.

2504
02:19:45,270 --> 02:19:46,830
I saved one man.

2505
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:51,290
Okay, nice.

2506
02:20:02,130 --> 02:20:04,690
You'll help me again if I ask, won't you?

2507
02:20:05,190 --> 02:20:06,810
I feel like I can always count on you.

2508
02:20:07,450 --> 02:20:07,890
Alright.

2509
02:20:09,890 --> 02:20:10,410
Now...

2510
02:20:12,190 --> 02:20:13,690
Wait, is this where Lu Bu is?

2511
02:20:14,650 --> 02:20:16,110
Is Lu Bu over here?

2512
02:20:20,940 --> 02:20:22,320
Okay, that's green.

2513
02:20:22,600 --> 02:20:23,580
Where is he?

2514
02:20:25,660 --> 02:20:26,280
Hello.

2515
02:20:27,240 --> 02:20:29,040
I worked so hard to be here.

2516
02:20:30,060 --> 02:20:31,320
Oh my god.

2517
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:33,800
I can finally pursue Lu Bu!

2518
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:42,130
Oh, it's me.

2519
02:20:42,690 --> 02:20:43,090
It's me.

2520
02:20:52,910 --> 02:20:53,570
Oh.

2521
02:20:53,570 --> 02:20:54,530
That was nothing unusual.

2522
02:20:59,130 --> 02:20:59,790
Oh!

2523
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:02,750
I have his attention!

2524
02:21:03,490 --> 02:21:03,810
Hehe!

2525
02:21:04,370 --> 02:21:05,690
I have his attention!

2526
02:21:07,930 --> 02:21:10,010
Oh my god, he noticed me, guys!

2527
02:21:10,130 --> 02:21:10,630
He noticed me!

2528
02:21:22,890 --> 02:21:23,550
Um...

2529
02:21:23,550 --> 02:21:25,470
It just turned out this way.

2530
02:21:26,670 --> 02:21:27,550
Oh.

2531
02:21:47,390 --> 02:21:49,010
Oh my god.

2532
02:21:49,950 --> 02:21:51,530
I'm so humble.

2533
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,750
Oh.

2534
02:22:03,630 --> 02:22:05,570
Oh, and what do you want to do?

2535
02:22:06,050 --> 02:22:06,770
Hahahaha!

2536
02:22:19,310 --> 02:22:22,710
I suspect I do, Lu Bu.

2537
02:22:22,710 --> 02:22:24,290
Hahahaha!

2538
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:31,570
Woah!

2539
02:22:35,550 --> 02:22:37,010
Woah, woah, woah, woah!

2540
02:22:39,130 --> 02:22:40,450
Woah, wait!

2541
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:40,950
You're leaving?

2542
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:51,470
Wait, don't leave!

2543
02:22:51,470 --> 02:22:52,850
Wait, no!

2544
02:22:53,030 --> 02:22:53,470
No!

2545
02:22:53,650 --> 02:22:54,010
Lu Bu!

2546
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:01,700
Okay.

2547
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:04,440
Deplete an enemy's fortune and activate him.

2548
02:23:04,480 --> 02:23:04,740
Why?

2549
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:07,060
Wait, why?

2550
02:23:07,180 --> 02:23:08,660
Oh, I need to use the twin pikes.

2551
02:23:09,560 --> 02:23:11,220
You want to make good use of it.

2552
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:11,840
Oh, goodbye!

2553
02:23:12,600 --> 02:23:13,020
Goodbye!

2554
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:14,500
Hahahaha!

2555
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:16,840
Hahahaha!

2556
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:18,680
Oh my goodness!

2557
02:23:19,300 --> 02:23:19,600
Guys!

2558
02:23:19,940 --> 02:23:22,020
Guys, he noticed me, guys!

2559
02:23:22,020 --> 02:23:24,680
Oh my god, he noticed me!

2560
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:26,880
Oh, woah!

2561
02:23:30,200 --> 02:23:30,680
Hahahaha!

2562
02:23:31,320 --> 02:23:33,100
Okay, what the fuck is Xiaohu doing?

2563
02:23:33,180 --> 02:23:35,580
I completed a stupid quest.

2564
02:23:36,300 --> 02:23:37,360
Okay, let's go here.

2565
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:38,900
Don't hold back, Lu Bu.

2566
02:23:39,960 --> 02:23:41,700
Thank you for the super chat.

2567
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:42,860
Thank you, thank you.

2568
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:45,480
Alright.

2569
02:23:46,640 --> 02:23:47,880
Did I complete it?

2570
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:49,080
Oh, I can pay for it?

2571
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:50,300
Fuck it, let's pay for it.

2572
02:23:52,280 --> 02:23:52,590
Hahahaha!

2573
02:23:53,240 --> 02:23:55,260
Let's pay for it.

2574
02:23:55,420 --> 02:23:55,980
Fuck it.

2575
02:23:56,680 --> 02:23:57,900
I don't...

2576
02:23:57,900 --> 02:23:59,940
I have the money, I'm fine.

2577
02:24:00,200 --> 02:24:01,560
I'm fast-tracked.

2578
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:03,480
I'm gonna fast-track it.

2579
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:06,860
It's worth it, guys.

2580
02:24:08,520 --> 02:24:09,860
It's so worth it.

2581
02:24:09,940 --> 02:24:10,680
Trust me.

2582
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:13,940
Didn't I finish all of Xiaohu's thing?

2583
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:19,700
I did.

2584
02:24:19,960 --> 02:24:21,320
He just doesn't want to talk to me.

2585
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:25,300
Okay, where is he?

2586
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:30,540
I forgot how to get there.

2587
02:24:30,820 --> 02:24:33,180
Guys, I forgot how to get there.

2588
02:24:34,680 --> 02:24:37,240
Wait, how do I get there again, guys?

2589
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:38,720
I don't remember.

2590
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:41,180
Oh, it's here.

2591
02:24:43,620 --> 02:24:45,260
He should be back there, right?

2592
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:47,780
Oh, I see him.

2593
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:51,340
He should be here, right?

2594
02:24:52,340 --> 02:24:53,580
No, I'm lost.

2595
02:24:53,580 --> 02:24:54,960
Is he here?

2596
02:24:56,780 --> 02:24:57,100
No?

2597
02:24:58,700 --> 02:24:59,600
Okay, where is he?

2598
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:01,780
Where is he?

2599
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:09,120
Where is he?

2600
02:25:10,060 --> 02:25:11,040
Is he here?

2601
02:25:14,240 --> 02:25:14,760
Wait,

2602
02:25:21,830 --> 02:25:22,310
am I in?

2603
02:25:23,370 --> 02:25:24,490
Oh, I have a letter.

2604
02:25:25,610 --> 02:25:26,610
I have a letter.

2605
02:25:26,610 --> 02:25:27,290
Oh!

2606
02:25:27,290 --> 02:25:29,810
I better see you here!

2607
02:25:31,130 --> 02:25:32,850
Get here now!

2608
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:39,010
And I will allow you to sit with me at my favorite eatery.

2609
02:25:39,450 --> 02:25:42,070
You have shown some semblance of confidence and battle.

2610
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:44,230
For that, you will be fed.

2611
02:25:44,710 --> 02:25:45,270
Get ready.

2612
02:25:45,290 --> 02:25:46,810
Oh my god!

2613
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:49,850
Wow, so forward!

2614
02:25:50,450 --> 02:25:52,030
Oh my god!

2615
02:25:52,650 --> 02:25:54,290
Oh, we're so in!

2616
02:25:54,290 --> 02:25:56,410
Get ready to leave as soon as you're done reading this.

2617
02:25:56,730 --> 02:25:59,870
You do not want to keep me waiting!

2618
02:26:00,150 --> 02:26:02,050
Oh my god!

2619
02:26:02,670 --> 02:26:03,110
Oh!

2620
02:26:03,610 --> 02:26:05,210
Oh, he's so funky!

2621
02:26:05,610 --> 02:26:07,450
Okay, look, there's a letter from you guys.

2622
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:11,030
I'd like to extend my gratitude for saving a caravan from the bandits.

2623
02:26:11,150 --> 02:26:12,350
I'm glad to see that you're fine.

2624
02:26:12,910 --> 02:26:14,770
Please allow me to explain why I'm writing.

2625
02:26:15,170 --> 02:26:16,890
This is the second time you have saved us.

2626
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:20,570
I better see you here, kitten!

2627
02:26:24,570 --> 02:26:27,190
You went all the way to save us from the scoundrels.

2628
02:26:27,650 --> 02:26:31,050
Well, I'm sure he would be delighted to see you as strong as ever.

2629
02:26:32,690 --> 02:26:33,430
Please take this.

2630
02:26:33,550 --> 02:26:34,710
It used to belong to the guard.

2631
02:26:35,090 --> 02:26:36,330
I hope it will serve you well.

2632
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:38,330
Okay, I don't care about all these other people.

2633
02:26:38,730 --> 02:26:39,550
We gotta go to Lu Bu.

2634
02:26:40,030 --> 02:26:41,230
I'll talk to them later.

2635
02:26:42,410 --> 02:26:44,870
He's waiting for me to pursue him, chat!

2636
02:26:45,730 --> 02:26:46,070
Okay.

2637
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:48,510
Alright, where is he?

2638
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:50,690
Guys, we have to get there now.

2639
02:26:50,690 --> 02:26:52,990
Oh my god.

2640
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:55,270
I'm ready to hear the secret chat.

2641
02:26:56,930 --> 02:27:00,130
Alright, let's head over.

2642
02:27:00,270 --> 02:27:01,050
Oh, I see him.

2643
02:27:01,390 --> 02:27:04,250
I see the big handshake in the sky.

2644
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:06,890
We can't keep him waiting, chat.

2645
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:08,510
We can't keep him waiting.

2646
02:27:08,930 --> 02:27:09,410
Hello?

2647
02:27:11,870 --> 02:27:14,790
Why is this game like this?

2648
02:27:15,450 --> 02:27:15,750
Luke!

2649
02:27:16,130 --> 02:27:16,510
Donkey!

2650
02:27:16,510 --> 02:27:16,590
Donkey!

2651
02:27:16,790 --> 02:27:18,850
This is important!

2652
02:27:26,390 --> 02:27:27,790
Okay.

2653
02:27:33,730 --> 02:27:34,290
Okay.

2654
02:27:38,650 --> 02:27:39,210
Oh.

2655
02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:45,630
Okay, guys, guys, guys.

2656
02:27:45,750 --> 02:27:46,330
What do I do?

2657
02:27:46,450 --> 02:27:49,350
They satisfy me enough or it doesn't matter that much.

2658
02:27:54,020 --> 02:27:55,860
Guys, no satisfaction.

2659
02:27:55,860 --> 02:27:56,080
No satisfaction.

2660
02:27:58,760 --> 02:27:59,840
Second one?

2661
02:27:59,960 --> 02:28:00,520
Second, okay.

2662
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,280
Oh.

2663
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:08,740
Oh.

2664
02:28:23,160 --> 02:28:26,180
He's so cool.

2665
02:28:30,900 --> 02:28:32,960
I won't tell DL Chan.

2666
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:37,620
I honed my skills and silenced my adversaries with brute force.

2667
02:28:38,640 --> 02:28:43,000
Then, I took to the battlefield and demonstrated my worth time and again.

2668
02:28:44,020 --> 02:28:46,680
In short order, all who opposed me had vanished.

2669
02:28:47,620 --> 02:28:51,820
The ones who remained extolled my martial prowess with abject devotion.

2670
02:28:52,940 --> 02:28:55,300
Anyone can speak of morality and compassion.

2671
02:28:57,140 --> 02:29:00,840
But, these will never come to pass with mere rhetoric alone.

2672
02:29:01,780 --> 02:29:09,000
Even the scoundrels and schemers desire the strength to triumph under any circumstance.

2673
02:29:10,500 --> 02:29:11,760
Am I wrong?

2674
02:29:16,660 --> 02:29:18,300
Oh my... Fuck, guys!

2675
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:18,980
Oh!

2676
02:29:20,720 --> 02:29:25,180
Do I not agree with him or do I just be like, I don't know.

2677
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:28,800
I'm just a dumb warrior.

2678
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:30,360
Two?

2679
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:31,500
Okay, two, okay.

2680
02:29:31,500 --> 02:29:39,800
Indeed, I expected you to refute me, given all your deeds and having saved so many lives.

2681
02:29:41,140 --> 02:29:43,830
I cannot comprehend you.

2682
02:29:44,080 --> 02:29:45,760
I'm a mystery to him!

2683
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:52,620
How is it you've come face to face with death over and over, yet you side with those who are all talk?

2684
02:29:53,600 --> 02:30:01,100
You should know that bravado and ambition rot with you in the earth when you leave this mortal coil.

2685
02:30:02,020 --> 02:30:09,620
And those who will take to the battlefield shielded by the strong and perish as their hollow prattle fails them.

2686
02:30:10,580 --> 02:30:14,420
The notion of a world filled with such rabble makes me sick.

2687
02:30:15,440 --> 02:30:23,660
I will stand above all things and teach all the men and women of the world that might makes right.

2688
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:31,040
Oh, fuck.

2689
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:33,360
Guys, guys, my wingmen!

2690
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:33,880
Guys!

2691
02:30:37,240 --> 02:30:39,700
Only the strong think such things.

2692
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:41,620
Not everyone can be so...

2693
02:30:41,620 --> 02:30:43,420
Guys, what choice do I make?

2694
02:30:44,520 --> 02:30:44,780
Two?

2695
02:30:44,900 --> 02:30:45,620
One or two?

2696
02:30:46,400 --> 02:30:47,260
One or two?

2697
02:30:49,160 --> 02:30:49,780
One?

2698
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:52,720
Dragoons, wingman me right now!

2699
02:30:55,240 --> 02:30:57,300
Guys, this is a group effort.

2700
02:30:57,300 --> 02:31:03,260
So, in the end, if I get in with Lu Bu, we all get in with Lu Bu, guys.

2701
02:31:03,460 --> 02:31:06,420
We're all gonna be with Lu Bu, guys.

2702
02:31:06,520 --> 02:31:08,040
I'm doing it for us, chat.

2703
02:31:08,280 --> 02:31:11,300
Don't lie and say like you don't want Lu Bu.

2704
02:31:11,380 --> 02:31:12,440
Don't fucking lie.

2705
02:31:12,600 --> 02:31:13,600
It's a group effort.

2706
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:14,480
It's a team.

2707
02:31:15,840 --> 02:31:19,120
We are all pursuing Lu Bu together.

2708
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,300
Like, it's our Lu Bu.

2709
02:31:21,300 --> 02:31:21,540
What?

2710
02:31:23,660 --> 02:31:27,460
We all get to pursue him.

2711
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:41,420
Whoa!

2712
02:31:43,420 --> 02:31:44,460
Whoa!

2713
02:31:48,580 --> 02:31:49,640
Oh my god!

2714
02:31:49,720 --> 02:31:51,080
I entertain him!

2715
02:31:51,340 --> 02:31:53,080
We entertain him!

2716
02:31:59,210 --> 02:32:01,390
Oh my god!

2717
02:32:01,550 --> 02:32:02,050
Lu Bu!

2718
02:32:04,030 --> 02:32:05,070
Take this.

2719
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:05,810
Okay.

2720
02:32:08,030 --> 02:32:11,550
Win five duels without being injured?

2721
02:32:12,130 --> 02:32:13,450
Jesus Christ!

2722
02:32:15,490 --> 02:32:16,790
Jesus Christ!

2723
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:19,090
He has such high standards!

2724
02:32:19,450 --> 02:32:20,590
What the fuck?

2725
02:32:23,070 --> 02:32:24,230
Oh my!

2726
02:32:24,410 --> 02:32:25,050
Can I pay?

2727
02:32:25,450 --> 02:32:26,150
Let me see.

2728
02:32:26,270 --> 02:32:26,510
Okay.

2729
02:32:26,990 --> 02:32:28,590
Let's see if I can pay again.

2730
02:32:28,910 --> 02:32:29,250
Guys.

2731
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:33,110
Alright.

2732
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:33,810
Let's see.

2733
02:32:34,810 --> 02:32:35,290
Oh.

2734
02:32:35,710 --> 02:32:36,470
It's you.

2735
02:32:38,770 --> 02:32:39,490
Oh my god.

2736
02:32:39,550 --> 02:32:39,850
I can.

2737
02:32:40,450 --> 02:32:40,770
Alright.

2738
02:32:40,850 --> 02:32:41,790
Let's go.

2739
02:32:46,650 --> 02:32:47,130
Nice.

2740
02:32:47,490 --> 02:32:48,350
We did it.

2741
02:32:50,170 --> 02:32:50,650
Alright.

2742
02:32:52,330 --> 02:32:52,810
Okay.

2743
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:54,470
We did it.

2744
02:32:54,550 --> 02:32:54,970
We paid.

2745
02:32:55,210 --> 02:32:56,390
Do I think I can get another letter?

2746
02:32:57,210 --> 02:32:58,930
Let's see if there's another letter for me.

2747
02:33:01,050 --> 02:33:03,810
I spent all Guys, I spent all my money on Lu Bu.

2748
02:33:03,970 --> 02:33:04,430
Do you think?

2749
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:13,130
Guys, I spent all my money on... There's a lesson in this, I think.

2750
02:33:13,530 --> 02:33:13,870
Okay.

2751
02:33:16,010 --> 02:33:18,090
I'm wailing for Lu Bu right now.

2752
02:33:18,190 --> 02:33:18,570
Guys.

2753
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:18,970
Okay.

2754
02:33:19,030 --> 02:33:19,230
Wait.

2755
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:22,170
I paid for it, so...

2756
02:33:22,170 --> 02:33:22,450
Okay.

2757
02:33:22,650 --> 02:33:23,390
He's still there.

2758
02:33:23,470 --> 02:33:23,810
Oh my god.

2759
02:33:23,830 --> 02:33:24,710
We're at level four, guys.

2760
02:33:25,010 --> 02:33:25,790
We're at level four.

2761
02:33:25,790 --> 02:33:27,270
Good lord.

2762
02:33:29,050 --> 02:33:30,190
Oh my god.

2763
02:33:30,610 --> 02:33:31,750
It's worth it, guys.

2764
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:32,650
You don't understand.

2765
02:33:33,070 --> 02:33:33,750
You don't understand.

2766
02:33:33,870 --> 02:33:39,070
You don't see the... You don't see the plan right now, but it's so worth it.

2767
02:33:39,470 --> 02:33:42,550
Guys, you don't understand.

2768
02:33:43,650 --> 02:33:45,670
It'll all be worth it in the end.

2769
02:33:46,970 --> 02:33:47,850
My lord.

2770
02:33:47,930 --> 02:33:51,230
You spent all our money on Lu Bu and now we're homeless.

2771
02:33:51,850 --> 02:33:53,910
Guys, I saved up for this occasion.

2772
02:33:53,910 --> 02:33:54,470
Chat.

2773
02:33:59,630 --> 02:34:00,730
Oh my god.

2774
02:34:00,790 --> 02:34:02,590
We're out in the balcony now.

2775
02:34:12,350 --> 02:34:13,470
Thank you.

2776
02:34:13,570 --> 02:34:14,250
It's called money.

2777
02:34:14,630 --> 02:34:16,070
It's called pay to win.

2778
02:34:25,130 --> 02:34:27,190
Oh, you think highly of me then?

2779
02:34:31,610 --> 02:34:34,430
I exist in this world.

2780
02:34:34,930 --> 02:34:35,690
Oh my god.

2781
02:34:39,650 --> 02:34:41,570
The music.

2782
02:35:03,570 --> 02:35:05,770
Oh my god.

2783
02:35:05,770 --> 02:35:06,090
What?

2784
02:35:10,670 --> 02:35:12,890
Oh my god.

2785
02:35:13,290 --> 02:35:13,370
What?

2786
02:35:16,910 --> 02:35:18,330
Oh my god.

2787
02:35:18,910 --> 02:35:19,930
Oh my god.

2788
02:35:20,270 --> 02:35:21,090
Oh shit.

2789
02:35:21,590 --> 02:35:24,170
I didn't think we'd get this far.

2790
02:35:24,870 --> 02:35:27,530
I suppose there's no escape.

2791
02:35:30,470 --> 02:35:31,650
Oh my god.

2792
02:35:32,010 --> 02:35:32,790
Oh my god.

2793
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:40,850
I'm moving so fast.

2794
02:35:40,970 --> 02:35:42,090
I'm moving way too fast.

2795
02:35:54,170 --> 02:35:54,990
Wow.

2796
02:36:00,730 --> 02:36:00,910
Wow.

2797
02:36:00,910 --> 02:36:01,630
Wow.

2798
02:36:14,490 --> 02:36:16,290
Oh fuck.

2799
02:36:16,490 --> 02:36:16,710
Okay.

2800
02:36:17,690 --> 02:36:21,070
Okay guys.

2801
02:36:22,110 --> 02:36:22,710
Wow.

2802
02:36:23,150 --> 02:36:25,850
I'm turning into Crash Bandicoot right now.

2803
02:36:25,890 --> 02:36:26,430
Wow.

2804
02:36:26,930 --> 02:36:27,110
Wow.

2805
02:36:30,270 --> 02:36:31,990
What the fuck?

2806
02:36:32,350 --> 02:36:33,290
Oh my god.

2807
02:36:34,910 --> 02:36:35,950
That's not subtle.

2808
02:36:36,310 --> 02:36:38,090
That's not subtle at all guys.

2809
02:36:38,230 --> 02:36:39,290
That was not subtle.

2810
02:36:40,610 --> 02:36:43,210
He literally was like, I want you.

2811
02:36:43,450 --> 02:36:45,310
I need you as mine.

2812
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:47,510
How am I supposed to interpret that?

2813
02:36:47,510 --> 02:36:48,410
How the fuck?

2814
02:36:49,310 --> 02:36:51,850
There is no bro relationship anymore.

2815
02:36:53,390 --> 02:36:55,110
Guys, do you think he likes me?

2816
02:36:58,810 --> 02:37:00,570
He likes us.

2817
02:37:01,030 --> 02:37:03,210
Guys, do you think he likes us?

2818
02:37:04,730 --> 02:37:06,090
Oh my god.

2819
02:37:06,670 --> 02:37:07,370
Okay.

2820
02:37:08,150 --> 02:37:09,170
I'm breathing.

2821
02:37:10,250 --> 02:37:10,450
Okay.

2822
02:37:11,050 --> 02:37:11,750
Okay.

2823
02:37:13,210 --> 02:37:14,550
What the shit?

2824
02:37:17,670 --> 02:37:19,510
What about Dad?

2825
02:37:20,610 --> 02:37:21,830
Well, you have a wife.

2826
02:37:22,130 --> 02:37:22,690
You have a wife.

2827
02:37:30,430 --> 02:37:31,890
But he has a wife.

2828
02:37:32,650 --> 02:37:33,470
Oh my god.

2829
02:37:38,370 --> 02:37:39,170
This is art.

2830
02:37:39,330 --> 02:37:40,450
Guys, we did this together.

2831
02:37:41,370 --> 02:37:41,990
Dude.

2832
02:37:47,830 --> 02:37:49,490
What do you mean fade him back?

2833
02:37:49,730 --> 02:37:50,470
Wait, what?

2834
02:37:57,890 --> 02:38:00,730
He doesn't even talk to his wife like this.

2835
02:38:01,070 --> 02:38:02,730
Oh my god.

2836
02:38:02,990 --> 02:38:04,090
We did it guys.

2837
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:05,650
We're all in.

2838
02:38:06,390 --> 02:38:08,710
Guys, I think he forgot the sentence.

2839
02:38:09,450 --> 02:38:11,430
How do I interpret that?

2840
02:38:11,430 --> 02:38:12,250
How do I?

2841
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:16,750
Guys, I don't think he's a roommate no more.

2842
02:38:16,870 --> 02:38:17,410
Guys.

2843
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:19,930
I don't think.

2844
02:38:20,890 --> 02:38:21,910
Oh my god.

2845
02:38:24,090 --> 02:38:26,890
Alright, you know what?

2846
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:27,310
That's it.

2847
02:38:27,370 --> 02:38:27,970
That's a good time.

2848
02:38:28,130 --> 02:38:29,430
That's a good ending.

2849
02:38:30,090 --> 02:38:30,690
Okay.

2850
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:35,250
He wants more than just a wife.

2851
02:38:36,450 --> 02:38:37,570
That's a good ending.

2852
02:38:37,570 --> 02:38:39,150
I think it was super chat.

2853
02:38:39,150 --> 02:38:39,630
Thank you.

2854
02:38:40,410 --> 02:38:42,110
Oh my god.

2855
02:38:42,610 --> 02:38:43,410
Okay.

2856
02:38:45,570 --> 02:38:46,370
Guys,

2857
02:38:50,930 --> 02:38:51,770
I told you.

2858
02:38:52,210 --> 02:38:53,830
Money fixes all problems.

2859
02:38:55,770 --> 02:38:59,430
Guys, maybe pay to win ain't so bad.

2860
02:38:59,710 --> 02:38:59,930
Chat.

2861
02:39:00,850 --> 02:39:04,130
Guys, we successfully pursued Lil Poo.

2862
02:39:04,210 --> 02:39:05,070
We did it.

2863
02:39:05,070 --> 02:39:07,470
We pursued him together.

2864
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:12,610
Oh my god.

2865
02:39:13,090 --> 02:39:14,690
Well, I'm gonna call it here.

2866
02:39:14,790 --> 02:39:16,990
I think this was a good stopping point, everybody.

2867
02:39:17,170 --> 02:39:18,790
I'm gonna go rest my voice now.

2868
02:39:18,930 --> 02:39:23,510
I did not mean to yell that much today, but like some of these.

2869
02:39:24,330 --> 02:39:25,650
Oh my god.

2870
02:39:26,570 --> 02:39:28,530
I paid for a Lil Poo meet.

2871
02:39:28,530 --> 02:39:32,390
We paid for a Lil Poo meet and greet and I don't regret it.

2872
02:39:36,930 --> 02:39:40,610
I did not expect some of the.

2873
02:39:41,030 --> 02:39:42,590
I did not expect the store.

2874
02:39:42,710 --> 02:39:47,490
Some of the fucking routes to lead this way, but yeah.

2875
02:39:47,670 --> 02:39:50,570
Anyway guys, as always everybody, stay hydrated.

2876
02:39:50,990 --> 02:39:51,630
Posture check.

2877
02:39:51,930 --> 02:39:54,110
