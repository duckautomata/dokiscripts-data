1
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:51,670
and hello hello today is gonna be a very lazy day i was
actually very tempted to like uh take the entire week off um

2
00:03:51,670 --> 00:04:00,570
because uh last week and the week before that the last two
weeks was like took a lot of my social battery i was not i

3
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:12,590
was not like there as a person after after sunday back to
back to back to back of like interactions with a lot of new

4
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:22,890
people so by and like also like a lot of like old friends
and my social battery was was like maxed out like I am

5
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:30,890
producer I am an introvert so I was like a fucking exhausted
by Sunday and then because like you'll be like oh it was

6
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:36,570
Saturday you know that's then you got rest I was like no I
on Sunday I also had another I had another sponsor collab

7
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,230
with Shibidoki.

8
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,430
so after that, my battery was like just gone.

9
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,030
I was like 0%.

10
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,150
Like, it's like flashing.

11
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,730
Like, stop.

12
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:45,350
Stop.

13
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,510
Like, the battery's gonna fucking explode.

14
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,350
If you charge it anymore.

15
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,590
so, but instead I decided to make this week more so of like,
you know, stuff I sort of wanted to play.

16
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:07,190
I want you guys to know, it was so hard to decide like, um
what to do on saturday because i just wanted to play games

17
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:17,890
that i just wanted to play and not actually like try but so
i was just like oh like i was like oh i've always wanted to

18
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:26,670
play the shadow game but like but i know you i know the
sonic fans are gonna yell at me but it's a game i've been

19
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:34,950
i've always wanted to play because i wanted to like shoot i
wanted to shoot a gun you You know, like that's the only

20
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:41,810
thing I know about the shallow hedgehog game You got like
you give him a gun and then you save the president That's

21
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:48,330
the only one I that's the only thing I remember I've never
played the game before so but I know I know I can already

22
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,950
feel it They'll be like what are you doing Doki?

23
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,350
I've never seen someone so bad at a Sonic game.

24
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,290
Yes, you have It will be on Saturday.

25
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:13,270
Yes, you have you're going to You are going to and it's
gonna be on Saturday So I could I can feel it I can feel I

26
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:23,430
can feel the typing going on Yes, we will The thing is I've
never really I didn't grow up with Sonic games too I didn't

27
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:29,470
grow up with Sonic games so like I always like whenever I
play a Sonic game It like always confuses me because only

28
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:37,830
Sonic games play like Sonic games like you don't get like
any other no other skill is transferable to a sonic game

29
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:47,970
because it's like you gotta go fast but like it's so fast
like i'm for some reason i'm never ready to go fast it's

30
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,730
just so fast but yet the whole premise is you gotta go fast
like

31
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:04,310
fun stop thank you for the super chat thank you thank you
hey ducky oh you're able to get the rival's new venom kick

32
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:11,250
MVP animation his cake is sweet thank you for the super chat
thank you thank you uh yeah I have yeah for those who don't

33
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:20,010
know uh tomorrow is uh the new anniversary the first year
anniversary for Marble Rivals and they were like releasing I

34
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:27,210
don't know if it was leaks I think I don't know I think it
was like either leaks or official uh official like uh skin

35
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:35,990
teasers for the new anniversary and uh one of them is venom
shaking his booty Okay, but like, that's not part of the

36
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,270
skin.

37
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:46,850
But the whole idea is that the new skin, the skin theme for
the first year anniversary is like sweets and baked goods.

38
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,030
And like, Venom is in it.

39
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,130
And he's literally a giant fucking candy.

40
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,430
And the whole thing is about Venom's cake.

41
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,490
And he starts shaking his booty and stuff.

42
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,290
Well, I'll show you guys.

43
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,670
It was all over my feed.

But I think the one, the really the cutest one is Jeff in
business.

45
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:12,370
a business suit because it's also a free skin and we love
free skins uh it's it is oh it is from the official account

46
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:19,030
okay because i saw other ones i saw like uh animation stuff
from other other accounts so i wasn't sure because you know

47
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,830
the rivals leaked account and stuff so i wasn't sure if it
was from the official one or the the leaked info one um but

48
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:31,570
they also have i think the other one i think the jeff one
was my favorite because um it's really funny because you

49
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:38,130
know how they always love to pit uh marvel rivals and
overwatches to each other so Overwatch has this thing called

50
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:45,050
mythic skins where you customize your skin based on how much
you level it up so you can like have like oh I want this

51
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,930
part of the skin I want this part of the skin I want that
part of the skin um so next so tomorrow they're releasing

52
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:59,610

55
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,150
Oh,

56
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,830

Let's see.

63
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,430
Where is it?

64
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,630
Where the fuck is the customization of the business skin?

65
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,130
Okay, but his intro is also really fucking cute too.

66
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:37,790
God damn it.

67
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,390
Where is it?

68
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:41,730
He's getting a free business Jeffskin that's customizable.

69
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,330
Yeah, he is.

70
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,330
Oh, yeah, here.

71
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,170
Wait.

72
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:47,850
Let me see.

73
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,670
Is this the one?

74
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,250
Yeah, yeah, this one.

75
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,910
So you can see here that you can see him.

76
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,630
You change his outfit and everything.

77
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:02,830
and it's all for free too so that's why people were freaking
out about it and um i don't i don't know if i could talk i

78
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:12,210
mean i guess like i'll hint something rivals told invited me
to something and they said it'll be just look at time square

79
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:28,050
tomorrow tomorrow on marvel rivals when the anniversary
update comes in check out time square If they added it,

80
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,490

81
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,890
If they did it, then I don't know.

82
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,790
Not real time.

83
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,170
Don't fly to New York City.

84
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,430
I don't mean real time square.

85
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,350
Don't fly to New York City.

86
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,690
Just boot up the game.

87
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,750
Guys, don't book a ticket right now to time square.

88
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,550
I meant the in-game time square.

89
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,810
In-game, in-game, guys.

90
00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:10,690

91
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:23,670
there then like uh i guess it included but i don't know
maybe i don't know i have no confirmation on whether or not

92
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:38,530
something is added tomorrow tomorrow um on the marble rivals
um on the marble rivals time square uh instructions unclear

93
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:45,550

house normal size thank you for the super chat thank you

94
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:53,350
thank you um i'm gonna be like i don't see enough movement
all the model rival players

95
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:05,270
so when the update comes up just check out time square and
see if anything special is added there um what else what

96
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:15,190
else oh yes that update that up this is good news this is
very good news that update so after you know the back and

97
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,930
forth with the hospital and everything you know but like his
medication for his kidneys you know and they're like we

98
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:27,610
gotta have him get his uh get a new test to make sure like
you know that we have to give less of his kidney medication

99
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:35,970
so you can get a new prescription for it so anyway finally
got the call back like two days ago um obviously when I was

100
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:43,170
still like you know fucking recharging my battery is so low
by the way um the thing is I have like so many collabs that

101
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,510
I end up to because of like I also have the maid cafe stuff
and then I have like holiday Matsuri as well so it's so much

102
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:56,890
like back to back to back like interactions and So it's like
I don't even know when I can actually properly which

103
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:04,210
technically this week is my Recharge week before I go back
to hell of like lots of work being thrown at me

104
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:13,150
So um but you know I always love I always love hanging out
with everyone it's just my social battery is so low right

105
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:20,690
now so um but like talking to you guys is like different
from like hanging out with like other uh other like vtubers

106
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,270
or other streamers because it's like a different type of
interaction.

107
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,830
You know, I'm just talking to, like, you know, I'm talking
to you guys and I read your chat.

108
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,810
I can choose not to read you guys.

109
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:37,170
But I can't, I can't, I can't choose, I can't ignore someone
that's literally in my Discord call.

110
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:45,410
Like, so, so, so I have to always be able to, you know, if I
don't, if they talk to me, I can't just like pretend I can't

111
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:45,990
hear them.

112
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:51,630
Like, I could pretend I didn't read what you say, but, and
you don't know about you ready or not.

113
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:12,350
read this high dokey she ignores me not now not anyway so so
it's like really different because like i actually have to

114
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:19,490
like be able to be one percent on i can't just disassociate
in the middle of like uh collab or something like i have to

115
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,750
be like there but here i could disassociate you Doki.

116
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,970
She's just disassociating right now.

117
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,830
She's so silly and quirky.

118
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,950
Anyway, where was I?

119
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,050
Fuck, I already forgot what I was talking about.

120
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,030
Oh yeah, that update.

121
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,650
So, they finally called me back.

122
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,710
They finally called me back two days ago.

123
00:14:49,410 --> 00:15:04,910
And they were like, is um he doesn't have kidney problems
anymore and i was like what they're like yeah the ph levels

124
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:14,310
of his kidneys are fine um he's not peeing out his protein
anymore and everything uh so his kidneys are okay and i was

125
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:24,870
just like what the fuck because i don't know if you guys
remembered but before then when he got diagnosed with kidney

126
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:32,810
issues they were like he's got to be on this medication
forever or he's gonna go into kidney failure and yeah

127
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:41,810
they're like it's not curable i mean i was they told me it
wasn't curable and he has to be on the medication for the

128
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:51,970
rest of his life so i was just like oh no and then yeah now
they're like good news he's better now and he doesn't have

129
00:15:51,970 --> 00:16:03,890
to be on his yeah it's a fucking christmas miracle like i
was just like what you mean i've been i've been wasting 200

130
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:16,570
um like i have every month and a half like 200 and 300 on
his medication alone and he's just he's just better like it

131
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,570
just doesn't have kidney failure anymore like i don't

132
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:35,170
It's great news, but I remember when they told me this and I
bawled my eyes out because I was like, yeah, yes, good vibe.

133
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,430
Why are you peeing out your protein?

134
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:46,890
Like, I was just like, I was like, you have to pee on this
medication for the rest of your life.

135
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,130
Why are you such a genetic mess?

136
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:53,350
And now they're just like, good news, he's just fine.

137
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:12,230
now he he's built different so i guess i guess that's okay
now yeah yeah so so i don't have to buy jk like jk

138
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:22,010
apparently it's he doesn't he doesn't have to be on
medication anymore um And yeah, it truly is a genetic

139
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,510
mystery.

140
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,110
He just tanked it.

141
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,610
I guess he just tanked kidney failure.

142
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:38,630
So anyway, anyway, so now he doesn't have to be on his
medication anymore, which thank God because he wasn't on his

143
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,110
medication for more than a month now.

144
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:48,050
And I got really scared because they were like, we can't
give you medication until he has a new examination.

145
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:55,810
So like I've been trying so hard to get a new appointment
for like more than a month and a half And then like so he

146
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,690
hasn't been on his medication for a month and a half.

147
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,050
So I got really scared Because I was like is his kidney
gonna be okay?

148
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:10,670
Um And now they're like oh yeah, it's fine now and he hasn't

No, Doki, do not grab ice cream.

193
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,850
So I was like, okay, I'm going to get ice cream today.

194
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:26,830
Today is the day I get ice cream because I was craving those
mixing ice creams, you know, like cha-cha-cha-cha and then

195
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,930
have rainbow sprinkles on top because I'm a child.

196
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:32,290
So I always get like cookie dough mixed in and they had
cotton.

197
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,910
I'm sorry, my ice cream flavors is an actual child.

198
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,990
So I would get, I would get cotton candy, cookie dough and
rainbow sprinkles.

199
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:50,050
And I'm going, craving that i was just like oh my god i
really want cotton candy ice cream mixed with cookie dough

200
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:59,970
and sprinkles and um and obviously i was like oh i can uber
eats that and and then and then the ice cream arrived and it

201
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:10,250
was a cookies and cream milkshake i was just like what the
fuck is i was like where's my ice cream it's not even blue

daddy ice cream with cookie dough and rainbow sprinkles so

204
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:39,250
i'm sad now i'm it doesn't even have sprinkles in my
milkshake get you see i used to be on door dash and then

205
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:47,050
they fucked with me so then i swapped the uber eats but then
that also are fucking me so it doesn't matter which app you

00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:58,410

i know it's 11 i don't know why i was like refund and then

207
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:07,610
they gave me 11 and i was like oh that's cool like i i
assume that includes like everything else too like the trip

208
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:18,870
and everything um so yeah so no i got i got my i got 11
yippee i still don't have my fucking ice cream though it's a

209
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:25,790
valentine's baby worse than being a birthday present baby
god thank you thank you you see being a birthday present

210
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:33,610
baby takes a lot more calculation because then you have to
remember your parents birthdays um that's that's really

211
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:44,630
fucked up i don't i i i'm really bad at birthdays so i'd
never remember it's okay guys if my birthday wasn't on a

212
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:56,910
fucking holiday i feel like i wouldn't remember my own
birthday sometimes i forget how old i am too so so like so i

213
00:23:56,910 --> 00:24:03,010
think like it's harder to calculate because then it requires
you to remember your own parents birthdays So like it's

214
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,190
right.

215
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,750
It's like, you know ignorance is bliss type deal.

216
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:16,970
Um, I'm an anniversary baby At least you're not I mean
there's there's two very I think it's like three common

217
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:25,110
babies It's um, it's New Year's baby New Year's baby
Valentine's baby.

218
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,550
I mean Christmas and New Year's are same.

219
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:34,730
So it's like Christmas New Year's baby because it's around
it's the same month type deal and then valentine's baby i'm

220
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:45,670
a new year's baby i know or a wedding wedding night okay
wedding night baby is funny wedding but to be fair that's

221
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,130
surprising because i read that like people who have weddings
um i told you this is like a chill relax i could have made

222
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:58,090
today a zastodon too but like i just wanted i wanted to play
a little game as well like i could have done i'm like more

223
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:06,630
relaxed and comfy right now but um but i heard that like uh
people who like like like couples at weddings are so fucking

224
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:16,210
exhausted after the wedding they just sleep like so so it's
very surprising if you got conceived during a wedding

225
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,030
because mostly most couples would just pass out after a
wedding um because the wedding's not for them it's for their

226
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:32,690
family and friends or too drunk yeah or too drunk um Anyway,
oh, what's, oh, and I still give a super chat, thank you,

227
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,710
thank you, huh, what's going on in my birthday?

228
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,290
What's going on in America?

229
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,410
Oh, it's my birthday.

230
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:40,090
Thank you for the super chat, thank you, thank you.

231
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:44,270
That's why honeymoon exists, yeah, for people who can afford
it.

232
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,470
What else?

233
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,650
What else I want to talk about?

234
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:53,290
There's something else I wanted to, oh, yes, the controller.

235
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,490
Good news, good news.

236
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:05,770
I was told that the cells of the controller has been doing
so well that they asked us if they could cap the cells.

237
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:11,030
So if you see it sold out, it means it's fully capped.

238
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,570
It means like, because it's all handmade, by the way.

239
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,150
The people who are making the controllers, it's all like
handmade.

240
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,910
So in Japan, it's all handmade in Japan.

241
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,770
So you know it's like good quality shit.

242
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:31,230
So the cells have been going They are going to cap the
amount at the end.

243
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:39,650
So if you see it say sold out, it's before the end of the
due date, pre-order date, which is in three days, by the

244
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,710
way, on the 28th.

245
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,370
That means they, like, fully capped it.

246
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:49,730
I know what the amount is, the fully capped number, and we
still have, oh, it's already, oh, wait, is it already out of

247
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,110
stock?

248
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,770
Wait, I didn't even finish?

249
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,290
Oh, I didn't even realize.

250
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,690
Wait, is it actually?

251
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,750
I didn't even realize those are...

252
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,890
Oh, shit, it is!

253
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,450
Okay, sorry, it's fully capped.

254
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,970
It hit the cap mark.

255
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,250
I was...

256
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,330
Yeah, I didn't even realize...

257
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,570
Yeah, sorry.

258
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,350
I guess you could have bought it yesterday.

259
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,110
I didn't even realize that it fully capped today.

260
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,710
That's cool.

261
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,090
That's really cool.

262
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,370
I'm so surprised.

263
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,370
Thank you, guys.

264
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,490
Thank you all for the insane support.

265
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:37,610
um on it um they were like oh we were their first overseas
uh collaboration um because like I said all the controllers

266
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:46,410
are made in Japan so we were their first overseas
collaboration and they said that they they like sold more

267
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:53,610
than they expected for it and um and they were like oh this
was like more than we got before like we got for

268
00:27:53,610 --> 00:28:01,370
collaboration um so they were very happy and I'm so as well
especially since it was a collaboration with a company in

269
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:10,050
japan um so i'm very happy about and thank you dragos for
the insane support um for supporting this brand and for

270
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:17,890
supporting this collab it really does mean a lot so yeah we
sold out okay i guess i can unpin this now i was not i was

271
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:23,510
not expecting us to sell out today because they told us
yesterday that they were going to cap it so that was crazy

272
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:30,910
that it hit the mark already wait i'm going to message my
manager and can unless they like accidentally cat like put

273
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:41,710
on soda i'm gonna say can you check if we actually hit the
cap already because because because it people were saying

274
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:52,790
are seeing it sold out all right all right nice yippee uh i
was waiting for payday reminder to not procrastinate i guess

275
00:28:52,790 --> 00:29:00,870
thank you my super chat aura thank you thank you yeah i was
i i was surprised because usually like they're uh usually

276
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:08,610
like i this is the first time where they had a cap in sales
but because like i said this is all handmade by the people

277
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:18,970
in japan too so um so it's not like it's mass manufactured
like in a factory they have like a bunch of workers in japan

278
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:28,310
actually handmaking it so that's why that's why they're like
we have to cap it we didn't expect to get this They were

279
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,270
like, we didn't expect this to happen.

280
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,930
So, is it okay if we could cap it this much?

281
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:37,570
Yeah.

282
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,110
So, yeah, anyway.

283
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:43,950
Anyway, let's play the Charlie solution.

284
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,430
But if there is a lot of, well, they come back to Yvonne.

285
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,330
They even super chat.

286
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,010
Thank you.

287
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:57,450
If there is a lot of people who still want to buy it, they
have asked us.

288
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:02,710
if we want to bring it back at a much later date after they
process all the orders.

289
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,610
And we're still talking about it.

290
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,550
We're still negotiating and stuff like that.

291
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,370
So we'll see.

292
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:12,410
Maybe you might be able to get it again for those who
haven't got it.

293
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,150
But it's my first actual full professional gaming gear.

294
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,730
So it was an honor to work with them.

295
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:27,430
And, you know, it was a cool experience.

296
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:33,010
too because like I said this is my first full-on
professional gaming gear that we got because it is like you

297
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:39,030
guys can get like the normal PlayStation controller but they
also have like an actual like you know pro gaming type

298
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:44,450
controller as well with the fast with the fast buttons or
whatever it's called I don't know I'm not a controller

299
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:52,910
player but you know what I mean for like for the actual pro

Thank you.

330
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,130
I didn't think they would cap sales early myself.

331
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:45,490
They pre-ordered what I did yesterday.

332
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,850

00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,590

It always makes me really happy to make, like, you know, to
be able to, like, you know, and also for e-dragos.

336
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,290

guys so much for the insane support on it.

338
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,230
Alright, let me double check.

339
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:13,350
Okay, manager has not said anything about gifts yet.

340
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,730
Alright, time for the trolley problem.

341
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,310
A trolley is quickly approaching five people tied to the
tracks.

342
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,530
You have the option to divert the trolley to a different
track where it will only hit one person.

343
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:32,750
That will say the five but make you responsible for the
death of one what would you do i would hit the one person of

344
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:43,450
course what the fuck like it's not that hard five is better
than one is it all right there you go hit that guy goodbye

345
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:53,190
morale yay five people i feel like the five people there's a
higher chance for five people to develop a cure for cancer

346
00:33:53,190 --> 00:34:02,770
than that one person all right i did that all right second
trolley yeah it's just one guy yeah instead i didn't kill

347
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:11,350
five people low kda i haven't died yet guys i can still have
a higher kda

348
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:23,650
what if what you don't know the five people have like we're
scientists too a trolley is quickly approaching a healthy

349
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:31,010
person tied to a hospital bed nearby there are five patients
in urgent need of organ transplants according to your logic

350
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:37,510
the lives of five people are worth more wait how did he know
about my logic are more more than the life of one so we use

351
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:44,450
a healthy person's organs to save the five patients can you
drag the five patients into place so the organs fall

352
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:55,850
directly into them and save their lives what the fuck okay
okay no i mean he's right no he is he is right though like i

353
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:07,170
mean we have to kill what like we like he is the one person
is an organ donor um and like his organs will save the five

354
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:17,970
people so he's not wrong though uh it's standard medical
procedure and those five people have been waiting on the

355
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:27,310
list for so long i had to take matters to my own hands guys
i saw that he was an organ donor and these five people have

356
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:36,070
been waiting on the list for years so i was like speeding up
the process he was gonna die eventually um and my eventually

357
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:54,810
is now well they have to be healthy for their organs to work
like we're not gonna use bad organs up for this that's what

358
00:35:54,810 --> 00:36:04,030
you get for being an organ donor like shouldn't have been an
organ donor i would have fucking sped up the process uh

359
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:16,870
should have signed no and never donate organs if you aren't
ready to die they never told you when they were gonna

360
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,530
harvest your own organs

361
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:28,750
I'm gonna say How do I know if I correctly put it in the
right area?

362
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:40,330
Like I don't fucking know Bro, I don't know where they're
gonna be Oh my god Where how is I Oh, I fucked it up Okay,

363
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:44,770

365
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,070

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,510
How is I supposed to...

367
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:59,410

368
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:00,270

00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,090
Extra organs.

376
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:23,370

377
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:24,770

00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:51,990

changed, like, they made, it's like, in America, they're

451
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:56,890
like, Wally's too common of a name, we need something
quirkier, so they've changed it to Wally.

452
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:00,390
Because the rest of the world is Wally.

453
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:04,930
A trolley is quickly approaching a guy standing next to a
puddle on the track.

454
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,090
If the trolley continues on his path, it will splash water
on the guy next to the track.

455
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:11,750
You have the option to divert the trolley to a different
track.

456
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:17,110
This will save the guy from getting wet, but it will cause
you to get, what the fuck, who the fuck is?

457
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:30,990
up with this one guy like bro I have a job to do that's on

458
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:44,490

459
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:48,030
wait a bit wait that's me all right I did see the guy over
here.

460
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:49,550
I was like, where is this guy?

461
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,070
That's right.

462
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:53,570
Get out of here!

463
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,030
I have the DLC lever!

464
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:00,230
Get out of here!

465
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:02,910
That was very nope.

466
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:07,910
He accidentally, I'm like, time reversal!

467
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,030
A trolley is quickly approaching a puddle on the trail.

468
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:14,250
Oh.

469
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,190
You have the option to save It'll continue.

470
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:20,630
It'll splash water and people beside the track.

471
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:37,370
You'll have the why save one from being who would you help
Oh my god, it's so fast No Not a young boy or an old man.

472
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:39,570
Why the fuck a dog or

473
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:50,430
You all know what type of person I am A pregnant lady or a
famous...

474
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:51,690
Let's put it next to it.

475
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,550
Holy shit.

476
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:56,010
No!

477
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,130
A robot or...

478
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,250
Save the robot.

479
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:04,490
Yeah, I was taking over.

480
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,250
What the fuck's a witch gonna do?

481
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,470
Sing me a defying gravity?

482
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:10,350
A mime or a clown?

483
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:13,130
I don't... I hate clowns, though.

484
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:15,190
Of course.

485
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:16,250
Stop.

486
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,070
Damn, you're ruthless.

487
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,570
A robot witch or a mime clown.

488
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:23,670
Oh my god.

489
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:24,050
Wait.

490
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,170
Okay, but like who the fuck?

491
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:32,230
Okay, a robot witch means the robot has magical powers and
can live forever.

492
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:36,430
Someone in a bathing suit or someone in a mud fight.

493
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,410
Or so, I mean, they're gonna...

494
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:39,610
What?

495
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,570
I have to save someone?

496
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:42,790
Oh no, I don't.

497
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,710
It gave me longer time to choose.

498
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:45,650
Okay.

499
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,050
Like, it's on them.

500
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,370
They could walk away.

501
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:52,650
Someone wearing white pants or someone wearing white shirt.

502
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:53,810
I think, you know what?

503
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,050
I think because if it splashes on the pants, it looks like
you peed yourself.

504
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,030
So I don't want that for anyone.

505
00:48:01,310 --> 00:48:04,010
A ghost or an invisible being.

506
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,390
That's on them for being invisible.

507
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,510
Oh, hey, Karn.

508
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,590
Was it someone burning or someone?

509
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,470
Alright.

510
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:15,430
Here you go.

511
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:15,950
Drink that.

512
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:16,450
Oh, shit.

513
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:16,750
Sorry.

514
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:28,750
gonna burn to death so I guess he's gonna burn to death
ghosts don't care you're right the what I mean he was

515
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:37,610
invisible so what could I do oops I forgot about the burning
guy I was like guys this guy is really thirsty though he's

516
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:49,790

519
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,940
Yeah, I love that.

520
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,640
Math was very hard.

521
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,520
Endy, thank you, Super Chat.

522
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:31,740
Thank you, thank you.

523
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:39,120
Weirdly, a lot of evil opposites are what called a nomadic
language instead of why, a lot of you, a Super Chat.

524
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:39,940
Thank you, thank you.

525
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:43,240
A trolley is quickly approaching person tied to the tracks.

526
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:49,280
You have the option to divert the trolley to save that
person, but the mechanism is connected to a math problem.

527
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,380
Can you...

528
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:56,920
I think this person is gonna you can pull the easy mode
lever if it gets hard at any time.

529
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,660
All right, where's the easy mode lever?

530
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,880
All right, where is it?

531
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,040
Easy mode

532
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,340
Yay two

533
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:22,940
Um Um one time times one!

534
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,220
Yay!

535
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,040
One divide by one is one!

536
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,120
Get the chill.

537
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:37,020
Yeah, we're...

538
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:38,820
Funny

539
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,150
shape?

540
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:47,870
Oh, it wasn't funny shape, guys.

541
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:50,310
It wasn't funny shape.

542
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:53,230
Did I do it?

543
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:54,090
Did I...

544
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:56,570
Did I save them?

545
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,050
I did.

546
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:00,770
Okay, we got this.

547
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:02,730
It was one.

548
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:04,530
Okay.

549
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,130
Oh, wait, two.

550
00:51:08,830 --> 00:51:09,930
Wait, this is easy.

551
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,720
16.

552
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,180
Wait.

553
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,460
Oh, I got this.

554
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,760
I'm so smart.

555
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,890
Three.

556
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:55,590
3 3 3 Our smart dog show 2 I'm so smart guys 2 The switch up
is crazy 1 Yeah

557
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,350
We did it, guys.

558
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:01,310
Quick maths.

559
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:08,180
A trolley is rapidly approaching five people tied to a
track.

560
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,880
So you have the option to divert the trolley onto a
different track.

561
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,900
This action will save the five people.

562
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,060
But it will blow away a dog's bone, leaving him sad.

563
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,380
What would you do?

564
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,260
We can't make a dog sad, guys.

565
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,280
You know how people are like, always goes on Google and be
like, Does the dog die?

566
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,380
No one ever does that for people.

567
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:30,520
Does the person in the movie die?

568
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,840
No one does that.

569
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,500
It's always the dog.

570
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,400
Screw the five people.

571
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:38,860
There we go.

572
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:39,800
That's right.

573
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,020
We can't make him sad, guys.

574
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:43,400
Yay!

575
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,580
The dog is happy now.

576
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,140
Five feet.

577
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,780
Yeah, no sad doggo today.

578
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:05,320
they wanted to be sacrificed for the dog that's right the
dog has entertainment and like a dinner and a show i'm such

579
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:10,680
a good person i know you're a good person they has been
saved

580
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:20,560
all right not a trolley but a shopping cart you have the
option to return the shopping cart to its rightful place

581
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:28,420
however this requires extra effort and offers no benefit to
you It's simply the right thing to do.

582
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,340
Literally, you can leave the car in the middle of the
parking lot.

583
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,680
No one would judge you.

584
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:35,020
But what would you do?

585
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:36,840
No one would judge me.

586
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,980
This is what teenagers were hired for.

587
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:43,700
Guys, this one I will judge you.

588
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,760
Okay, but what if I leave the shopping cart on the side of
the road?

589
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,000
Like right here, you know?

590
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,740
What's this?

591
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,440
What does this do?

592
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,440
What do I turn it to?

593
00:53:58,920 --> 00:53:59,720
Oh, is he gonna go?

594
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,820
Oh, wait, okay.

595
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,120
See, look at that, guys.

596
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,840
See, I did it.

597
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,220
I didn't have to actually move anything, guys.

598
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,440
She's...

599
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,300
So, oh, wait.

600
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,340
Wait, okay.

601
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:16,480
Normally, if no one would judge me...

602
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,660
This person might act.

603
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,260
The thing is, what were those teenagers paid to do, though?

604
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:34,260
you know i wouldn't leave it in the middle of the road i
mean that's okay that's fine

00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:35,340
checkout You can't take all the groceries at once.

611
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:36,120

I still have time.

619
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,880
Wait, it's a shopping cart full?

620
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,000
Oh, I could still do it.

00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,280

different track but on the track is your best friend also

653
00:57:53,140 --> 00:58:00,340
tied up however you discovered that your girlfriend has been
cheating on you with your friend but your best friend didn't

thing is he didn't know that that was my girlfriend but she

00:58:51,800 --> 00:59:02,080
knew that that was my best friend so she's a whore so and
like that's the thing She's the one that fucked me.

659
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,680
Like, he didn't know.

660
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,160
He or she did not know.

661
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:09,880
And bullshit, he didn't know.

662
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:11,240
There's no way.

663
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,200
Yeah, like, I never, that's true.

664
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,200
I mean, like, I never showed a picture of my girlfriend to
my best friend.

665
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,300
What am I afraid of?

666
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,840
Like, there's no way.

667
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,800
He did not need to assist.

668
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,940
He is terminally ill and will die of cancer.

669
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,940
The thing is, oh, but.

670
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:39,080

only will he die of cancer the person he was the love of his

671
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:46,920

00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,200

01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,360
How would he not know?

681
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:46,960
I didn't show him a photo of my girlfriend.

682
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,040
Come down, Toki.

683
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,320
You already won.

684
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,340
You made this so much darker.

685
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,960
I mean, end game, guys.

686
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,000
Thank you for the super chat.

687
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:00,480
Thank you.

688
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,560
Thank you.

689
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,700
A person is quickly approaching five trolleys on the tracks.

690
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:12,300
You have the option to pull a lever to try to make that
person run the other way.

691
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:17,600
However, that wouldn't make much of a difference since the
person would just hit the trolleys and fall back.

692
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:17,920
What?

693
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:18,840
Okay.

694
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,900
Person is quickly approaching five trolleys.

695
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,000
However, that wouldn't make much of a difference since...

696
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,960
Well, then what's the point?

697
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,360
He's got to lose it.

698
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,100
anyway, might as well.

699
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,480
It doesn't, it says it doesn't make much of a difference.

700
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,680
He's just gonna do it.

701
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:40,100
Yeah, it's the illusion of choice.

702
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:41,540
Like, oh my God, look at this man.

703
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,760
No, this guy deserves to die.

704
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:43,400
Never mind.

705
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:52,200
Like, like, like, no, like, no, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna
fucking stop stupid.

706
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,160
Like, the survival of the fittest.

707
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:00,260
like, Pain is a good teacher.

708
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,180
He's like, there's no way.

709
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,840
There's, no, the solution is to let him live with his
decision.

710
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,600
He's not going to learn until he fucking hits his head.

711
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,740
Like, no, not the trolleys.

712
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,200
The premise of the questions that he didn't know, besides,
you're single and so is he, you know, could always be a pro

713
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,360
and give him my god the last one.

714
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:28,960
Thank you.

715
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,460
Thank you.

716
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,100
He had to learn.

717
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,260
A trolley is... It's called Natural Selection.

718
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:40,020
A trolley is quickly approaching the station.

719
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,500
There are five people who are late to their jobs.

720
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,400
Inside the trolley and five people tied to the tracks.

721
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,240
You have the option to divert the...

722
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,460
Who the fuck is tying these people on the tracks?

723
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,960
You have the option to divert the trolley to a different
track where it wouldn't hit anyone.

724
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:02,560
That would save the five but it would make the people in
this trolley really late and they might lose their

725
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:03,460
livelihoods.

726
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,460
What would you do?

727
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:13,480
Okay, but if those people got tied to the tracks, they're
too stupid.

728
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:19,020
They're those stupid ones that got themselves caught and
tied to the tracks, guy.

729
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:24,180
They might, they might lose their livelihoods.

730
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:30,540
It doesn't mean they'll actually lose their jobs.

731
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:32,400
But what if they do?

732
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,300
That's on me.

733
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:41,300
And then they're going to sue me if they lose their jobs
because they're going to blame it on the trolley.

734
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:48,620
But if we kill those five people, maybe the people in the
trolley are lawyers and they can defend me.

735
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,500
Like, I should have been on time.

736
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,760
maybe like who's gonna sue me if those five people die

737
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:15,390
okay oh you're right they have no money to sue if they have
no jobs you're right you're right oh it's such a hard

738
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:25,930
decision do i save the people who are so hard guys people
who they might lose their jobs guys they might it's such a

739
01:04:25,930 --> 01:04:27,030
hard decision

740
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:43,730
all right what would you do it's such a hard decision guys
okay fine i guess we'll save those people it's fine they

741
01:04:43,730 --> 01:04:50,290
said they might lose their livelihood it maybe maybe maybe
they'll be okay

742
01:04:53,430 --> 01:05:06,130
capitalism for the win do i choose capitalism or like morals
no they're late and they're gonna lose their jobs okay it's

743
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:15,090
y 'all your fault who are who's gonna take care of their
families now modern life has become too fast-paced people

744
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:20,790

up eight passengers and help them solve their philosophical

745
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:27,230
problems before a time Lorenzo, you just got seven divorces
and two deaths, don't you?

Oh my god, what the fuck?

Oh my god, it's Crazy Taxi.

750
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:39,270
All right.

751
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,730
Oh my god, what the fuck?

752
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:43,310

753
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:45,370

I just ran someone.

762
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,670
A rage quitter or a grifter?

763
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,350
What's that supposed to mean?

764
01:06:08,290 --> 01:06:08,690
Alright.

Okay, this is hard Okay I feel like I don't know like two
people I mean if I eliminate two is more than one yet, but

793
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:44,670
if I eliminate two then that Oh man, that's hard.

794
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:47,250

mouth open as a mouth chewer.

01:09:20,330 --> 01:09:21,930
I chew in my mouth.

807
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:23,570

Look at that.

But guys, we don't want to push that bull there.

823
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:11,610
One must imagine the trolley happy.

824
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,750
Tokey, don't be weak.

825
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:18,970

What is it?

828
01:11:22,790 --> 01:11:24,270
Wait, which one did I do?

829
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:25,390
Is her trolley?

830
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:26,590
Was that the one I did?

831
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,450
Pushing a boulder.

832
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,730
Okay, I want to see what it looks like.

833
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,230
What does it look like when I push the boulder?

834
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,370
We found five new people to tie to the tracks.

835
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:42,750
Oh my god.

836
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:47,490
Oh my god, he's going to keep doing this forever and ever.

837
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:50,030
He doesn't know it's meaningless.

838
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,790
He doesn't know.

839
01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:53,990
Alright, go viral.

840
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:56,890

841
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,530
ZF, thank you for the super chat.

842
01:11:58,770 --> 01:11:59,370
Thank you.

01:11:59,370 --> 01:11:59,630
Thank you.

844
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:03,390
I'm trying to convince myself you're still a good person.

845
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:07,970
I spared the trolley from pushing a boulder for eternity.

846
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:12,190
One must imagine the trolley happy.

847
01:12:14,450 --> 01:12:17,730
A trolley is quickly approaching five people tied to the
tracks.

848
01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:21,410
You have the option to divert the trolley to a different
track where it wouldn't hit anyone.

849
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:27,730
That would save the five, but it will trigger a mechanism
that would post a very controversial message on your social

850
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:31,210
media guys guys I have five almost 500k followers.

851
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:38,850
I Yes guys guys guys Guys five people is five

852
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:44,470
We can't get canceled.

853
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:54,770
Yes I refuse I refuse to get canceled I Okay, a happy gap.

854
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,890
I already eliminated the witnesses.

855
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:01,170
Who's going to record this?

856
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:13,190
For deceiving the gods, you have been punished to push a
trolley for all eternity.

857
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:15,570
Or at least until the next station.

858
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:20,390
Control your strength, breathing, and balance to get to the
next stop.

859
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:21,010
Okay.

860
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,150
We're deceiving us.

861
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:28,690
I mean, you can explain the message.

862
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:30,990
Not the killings.

863
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:33,850
No, no, I can't.

864
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,270
If it's on the internet, it's there forever, guys.

865
01:13:36,650 --> 01:13:37,150
It's there.

866
01:13:39,670 --> 01:13:40,270
All right.

867
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:41,750
Okay.

868
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,230
You have been punished to push a trolley.

869
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:45,670
At least until the next station.

870
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:46,050
All right.

871
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,330
How do I control it?

872
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:52,210

Oh, oh.

878
01:14:30,030 --> 01:14:31,170
I didn't realize.

879
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:33,670
I didn't realize that's what...

880
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:33,990
Okay.

881
01:14:37,670 --> 01:14:38,090
Okay.

882
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:40,430
Oh my god.

883
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:42,370
I'm controlling it.

884
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:43,990
Okay, it's fine.

885
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:45,090
Everything is fine.

886
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:46,090
Breathe, bro.

887
01:14:46,270 --> 01:14:46,430
Breathe.

888
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:47,730
Remember to breathe, bro.

889
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:50,130
Guys, bro, remember to breathe, bro.

890
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:52,230
That's right.

891
01:14:54,530 --> 01:14:56,150
Breathing is very important.

892
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:59,570
Look at that, bro.

893
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:00,710
Keep pushing.

894
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:03,130
Oh, my God.

895
01:15:04,410 --> 01:15:04,930

896
01:15:05,450 --> 01:15:06,310
Breathe, bro.

897
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:14,510
Now my automatic breathing is gone.

898
01:15:14,730 --> 01:15:15,010
That's okay.

899
01:15:15,330 --> 01:15:16,050
Oh, shit.

900
01:15:16,450 --> 01:15:17,470

This way.

914
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:11,010
It's surprising.

915
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:14,050
I don't have to worry about breathing that as much as I
thought I have to.

916
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:15,750
Okay.

917
01:16:16,350 --> 01:16:16,790

Just gotta make sure.

919
01:16:19,070 --> 01:16:20,650
Living is very difficult, guys.

920
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:23,470

I don't know what Mr. Boss Man wants.

928
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:28,090
But it's okay.

929
01:17:29,310 --> 01:17:30,710
Hot sandwich in your area.

930
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:31,890
Ooh, we'll keep that up.

I don't know.

934
01:17:36,810 --> 01:17:37,790
We should keep that one up.

935
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:38,650
Oh my god.

936
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:39,890
Okay.

937
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,050
I think the balance one is definitely the hardest.

938
01:17:43,570 --> 01:17:44,870
You might have a virus.

939
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:46,530
That's the chance I'm willing to take.

940
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:47,270
Oh god.

941
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:48,790
Bye.

942
01:17:51,570 --> 01:17:52,950
I think that was the best.

943
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:54,210
That's the best ad they did.

944
01:17:55,690 --> 01:18:02,270

There's one thing you can do if you just have too much
money.

949
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:28,790
All right.

950
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:30,930

All right.

964
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:54,050
a trolley is quickly approaching a person tied to the tracks

The first person would know I saved their life So Like I

Let's go.

976
01:20:33,570 --> 01:20:35,290
I can't be responsible for either.

977
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,390
There's no witnesses.

978
01:20:37,110 --> 01:20:39,570
The illusion and the double kill.

979
01:20:39,970 --> 01:20:40,970
Yay, double kill.

980
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:42,730
The illusion of choice.

981
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:45,450
The free will is amazing.

982
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:46,130
Boom.

983
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,130

Well then.

987
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:51,910
Well, at least there were no witnesses.

988
01:20:55,630 --> 01:20:57,830
Yay, positive KDA.

989
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:00,250
It could always scale higher because I haven't died yet.

990
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:04,950
One with one free.

991
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,950
A trolley is quickly approaching five people tied to the
tracks.

992
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:12,510
You have the option to pull a lever next to the trolley.

993
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:15,510
It wouldn't save the five, but with the accident.

994
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:16,350
Oh, yo.

995
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:17,310
Incredible.

996
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,950
Yo, okay, we got to make...

997
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:19,990
They're going to die anyway.

998
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:21,510
We got to make it look cool.

999
01:21:22,070 --> 01:21:22,490
You know?

1000
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:28,850
That's right.

1001
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,970
Shot by Michael Bay himself.

1002
01:21:33,350 --> 01:21:35,570
Only one choice cinema.

1003
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:37,310
The Michael Bay.

1004
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:42,070
I mean, if they're gonna die anyway, might as well make it
look fucking cool as hell.

1005
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,030
Wait, I can do it again?

1006
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:46,510
Let's look and go.

1007
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:51,750
Oh, wait, this is a different one.

1008
01:21:56,860 --> 01:22:03,500

Yeah, and he has it.

1016
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:53,880
They haven't paid him anything.

1017
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,200
A trolley is quickly approaching five people tied to the
tracks.

1018
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:06,880
But that doesn't guarantee the collision will be caught on
camera.

1019
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:11,420
He operates a broadcast console and makes sure the trolley
stays on screen for at least...

1020
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:13,320
Oh yeah, let me make sure my...

1021
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,960
The evidence is there.

1022
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,500
Wait, how do I...

1023
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,720
Okay, don't worry.

1024
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:23,520
Alright, don't worry.

1025
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:25,480
It's still in camera.

1026
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:28,220
We got it all.

1027
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:31,900
Oh, it's coming back.

1028
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:33,920
It's coming back.

1029
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:35,860
Oh, shit.

1030
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:41,000
I'm sorry.

1031
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,740
I got too interested in that.

1032
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:44,600
I was like, whoa, what the fuck is that?

1033
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,760
And then I'm making people at the beach.

1034
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:50,440
Oh, shit.

1035
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:50,980
Oh, my God.

1036
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,160
Don't put there's a cat there, though.

1037
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:55,600
about the cat.

1038
01:23:57,780 --> 01:23:59,800
What you're looking at, took nothing.

1039
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,220
You don't know what it is.

1040
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:04,860
Alright, there's that.

1041
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:06,600

01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:13,360
Oh, shit.

1044
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:14,120
Now it's here.

1045
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:16,160
Now the trolley is here.

1046
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:17,760
God, when is he gonna... Oh, my God.

1047
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,200
My favorite streamer's on, guys.

1048
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:20,820
Oh, my God.

1049
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:21,140
Wait, wait.

Guys, my favorite streamer was on.

1058
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:51,170
Not everything has to be about running people over.

1059
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,170
A trolley is quickly...

1060
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,750
Approaching and your mom is tied to the tracks.

1061
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:05,430
You have the option to divert the child to a different track
where it only hit one person But that person is your father

1062
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:07,730
What would you do?

1063
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,730

I hanged up with my dad more than my mom.

1070
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:15,290
Now where you, it takes two people to make a child.

1071
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,490
You can't say that.

1072
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:18,350
It takes two people.

1073
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,410
Gaming saves lives.

1074
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:31,630
A trolley is quickly approaching people a need you have the
option to avoid them and head to the vip area instead or you

Oh, I should be upgrading.

1106
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:57,190
I didn't realize there were other upgrades.

1107
01:29:58,050 --> 01:30:02,530
A person thinking while wearing glasses in a pipe spot is
surrounded by people doing the same.

1108
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,630
I did that.

1109
01:30:06,730 --> 01:30:08,510
Oh my god, now there's showers!

1110
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:11,410
Shower thoughts!

1111
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:17,470
Realize their own existence after thinking about it.

1112
01:30:17,790 --> 01:30:18,310
That's me.

1113
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:19,570
I did that.

1114
01:30:21,170 --> 01:30:22,610
Education for everyone.

1115
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:31,370
a good person oh my god we should have more shower thoughts
guys magic comes from showers

1116

1118
01:30:50,970 --> 01:30:55,210

01:30:56,650 --> 01:30:57,970
480 thoughts per shower.

1120
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:00,090
That's a lot of shower thoughts.

1121
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:00,450
You know what?

1122
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:01,070

Add more philosopher.

1124
01:31:02,930 --> 01:31:04,650
We need more showers for all the philosophers.

1125
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:06,510
They can't just share all these showers, guys.

1126
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:07,430
That's disgusting.

1127
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:12,750
I mean, to be fair, it doesn't hurt to share like three
people in a shower together.

1128
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:14,350
You know, less water wasted.

1129
01:31:15,050 --> 01:31:17,070
Oh no, we're gonna make them depressed.

1130
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:18,990
Oh no, they think too hard.

1131
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,990
They're gonna start getting depressed, guys.

1132
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:21,850
All right.

1133
01:31:22,410 --> 01:31:23,410
I could add more for a lot.

1134
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:26,530
people to dump to care.

1135
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:31,730
Sharing saves water.

1136
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:33,810
Sharing is caring, guys.

1137
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:35,510
Alright.

1138
01:31:37,230 --> 01:31:37,790
There you go.

1139
01:31:38,710 --> 01:31:40,990
No, it's the trolley problem.

1140
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:43,310
This isn't Cookie Clicker.

1141
01:31:43,410 --> 01:31:44,790
It's called Saving the World.

1142
01:31:45,510 --> 01:31:46,390
Oh my god, University.

1143
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:46,990
It's time.

1144
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:48,670
Are you guys ready to go into debt?

1145
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:50,990
It's time.

1146
01:31:52,810 --> 01:31:54,390
I don't even have to click it anymore.

1147
01:31:54,410 --> 01:31:56,250
What's plus one going to do if anything?

1148
01:31:56,390 --> 01:31:57,290
I just wait.

1149
01:31:58,370 --> 01:32:00,590
Guys, it's time to go into debt, guys.

1150
01:32:01,530 --> 01:32:02,470
Debt time, baby.

1151
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:06,650
With all these philosophers, I might as well get my money's
worth, you know?

1152
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:08,510
University.

1153
01:32:10,890 --> 01:32:12,570
Student loans, yippee.

1154
01:32:14,130 --> 01:32:15,050
Life is meaningless.

1155
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:15,810
Oh, no, wait.

1156
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:16,590
They're getting sad.

1157
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:17,010
Oh, no.

1158
01:32:17,050 --> 01:32:18,430
They're thinking too much, guys.

1159
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,550
They're getting sad now.

1160
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:22,710
They're thinking too much.

1161
01:32:24,410 --> 01:32:25,990
Get ready to pay up.

1162
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:27,710
Guys, I made the world smart.

1163
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:29,790
So, yeah, I gotta get something in return.

1164
01:32:30,410 --> 01:32:34,510
No point in thinking of anything says local idiot RNS.

1165
01:32:34,930 --> 01:32:36,530
Oh, 4,000 thoughts?

1166
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:37,350
That's a lot.

1167
01:32:37,670 --> 01:32:39,690
Produce a hundred thoughts per second.

1168
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:42,710
Oh, and philosophers only produce two.

1169
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:43,290
The fuck?

1170
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:44,490
Why did it invest in you?

1171
01:32:45,030 --> 01:32:45,830
You were useless.

1172
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:49,170
This is a hundred thoughts per second, guys.

1173
01:32:50,950 --> 01:32:54,030
Thought multiply effect from hot water and soap discovered.

1174
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:56,010
Nice.

1175
01:32:56,950 --> 01:32:57,230
Alright.

1176
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:58,590
5,000.

1177
01:32:59,370 --> 01:32:59,730
Nice.

1178
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:01,330
We're making more universities.

1179
01:33:01,710 --> 01:33:04,130
We gotta make community colleges too.

1180
01:33:05,150 --> 01:33:09,990
We gotta make community colleges for those who can't afford
like insane student loans.

1181
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:14,990
And then make them transfer to a better university later
down the line.

1182
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,550
And then hit them with the student debt.

1183
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:20,850
A few of those with great thoughts.

1184
01:33:21,150 --> 01:33:21,630
There we go.

1185
01:33:22,350 --> 01:33:23,890
Oh, I gotta make trade schools too.

1186
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:24,390
You're right.

1203
01:36:03,230 --> 01:36:04,550

was like really smart at that time, but then, you know, the

1207
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:39,360
day after, I'm like, bro.

1208
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:45,220
Oh, the trolley.

1209
01:36:45,900 --> 01:36:48,940
Bidsters love to gather around this and think as hard as
they can.

1210
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,980
Most of them like to pretend they are smart.

1211
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,700
Oh, shit, we gotta get the trolley.

1212
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:55,360
Then we can get rid of the extra dumb people.

1213
01:36:59,060 --> 01:37:01,300
Doesn't mean they're very smart, though.

1214
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,440
People gather to discuss the moral implication of peeing in
the shower.

1215
01:37:05,940 --> 01:37:07,280
Okay, shower poopers.

1216
01:37:07,540 --> 01:37:09,740
Okay, I would say peeing in the shower.

1217
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:10,460
Okay, you know what?

1218
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,280
Peeing in the shower saves water.

1219
01:37:12,680 --> 01:37:15,520
You know how much water flushing the toilet gives you?

1220
01:37:16,540 --> 01:37:18,560
And you're gonna be clean anyway.

1221
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:19,940
Anyway.

1222
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:24,280
Alright.

1223
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,340
Yeah?

1224
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,560
Okay, who's gonna...

1225
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:29,820
Change my mind.

1226
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:30,680
Change my mind.

1227
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:33,040
Why is peeing in the shower bad?

1228
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:35,800
Don't even know.

1229
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,520
Why is it bad?

1230
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:39,160
Don't.

1231
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:41,520
Why?

1232
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,620
I want to know.

1233
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:45,940
It's not.

1234
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:46,620
It's not.

1235
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:47,620
That's the thing.

1236
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:48,160
It's not.

1237
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:48,800
You can't.

1238
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:49,560
You can't.

1239
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,760
You can't change my mind.

1240
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,800
You can't make me look like a bad person.

1241
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:54,840
It's not.

1242
01:37:56,440 --> 01:37:58,300
Shower peers rise up.

1243
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,680
Because I didn't.

1244
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,280
Don't piss on your feet.

1245
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,140
You can aim it.

1246
01:38:04,540 --> 01:38:05,380
If you're a guy.

1247
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,500
If you're a girl.

1248
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,520
Technically you just gotta spread.

1249
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:16,340
And the water cleans it after.

1250
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,580
I don't know how else to explain it.

1251
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:25,780
Just lock in.

1252
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,740
Didn't need this.

1253
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,280
I hate this conversation.

1254
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:44,680
I'm just saying I don't understand why why that is a
controversial debate Toilet is like two feet away

1255
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,240
Okay Is that what else everyone is buying time shares?

1256
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,300
That's not smart.

1257
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,300
I thought time shares is a scam

1258
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:06,400
History thank you for the super chat.

Wait.

1270
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:32,280
People are swallowing thumbtacks.

1271
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,480
Now you will catch them even if they manage to move to the
sides.

1272
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:37,400

This trolley solution might not be solving anything.

1278
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,880
I feel like I'm solving all the world's problems right now.

1279
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:20,000
There we go.

No survivors.

Say philosopher.

01:41:20,160 --> 01:41:21,320
I mean, that makes sense.

1297
01:41:22,140 --> 01:41:22,420
Okay.

1298
01:41:23,460 --> 01:41:24,460
Almost there.

1299
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,160
All right, got it.

1300
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:27,520
Holy shit.

1301
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:28,280
It's fucking.

1302
01:41:28,820 --> 01:41:29,700
Oh my god.

1303
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:30,980
Oh, there we go.

1304
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:33,140
Oh, it's going so fast now.

1305
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:34,200
Oh my god.

1306
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:35,120
6,000.

1307
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:35,800
Whoa.

1308
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,260
That's a lot of thoughts.

1309
01:41:38,280 --> 01:41:39,720
When will it stop?

1310
01:41:40,780 --> 01:41:41,900
Do I have to max it out?

1311
01:41:42,040 --> 01:41:42,840
What happens if I...

1312
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:43,860
Do I just max it out?

1313
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:46,940
Oh, it doesn't matter.

1314
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,820
It doesn't even matter.

1315
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:49,500
I just...

1316
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:50,680
It just fills the entire...

1317
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:50,960
You know what?

1318
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:51,440
Fuck it.

1319
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:53,440
Just filled all of it.

1320
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,620
Do I finish?

1321
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:56,440
Is this done?

1322
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:01,050
Do I have anything else?

1323
01:42:01,170 --> 01:42:04,270
New buildings fully appear.

1324
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:06,950
When does it stop?

1325
01:42:08,610 --> 01:42:09,530
I thought...

1326
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:09,630
I was...

1327
01:42:09,650 --> 01:42:24,350
am I not you can make it new upgrades at 50 where's 50 it
never ends it never stops you mean I'm stuck here forever

1328
01:42:24,350 --> 01:42:37,150
why would it stop there's more people realize their own
existence after thinking about it oh 50 oh I need to get 50

1329
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:47,370

1330
01:42:50,660 --> 01:43:01,740

whoops I guess they just never had oopsie they just never

1331
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:13,440

that's awkward that's oops forgot about that I feel like

1332
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:17,800
that might have been very important to have for my people.

1333
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:20,020
This could be a great video game.

1334
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:22,280
Stay clueless game developer.

1335
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:28,220
No, I never played Cookie Clicker because I have better
things to do.

1336
01:43:29,700 --> 01:43:30,380
I thought about it.

1337
01:43:30,500 --> 01:43:31,440
I was like, should I say it?

1338
01:43:31,480 --> 01:43:32,460
But no, it's the truth.

1339
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:34,520
It's actually, guys, it's why?

1340
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,020
Why?

1341
01:43:35,120 --> 01:43:37,260
Why would you be playing Cookie Clicker?

1342
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:37,640
Why?

1343
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:42,920
To reveal that death.

1344
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:59,060
Now need to buy Now you can erase and wait Oh yeah That
seems like a waste of my resources Because I like Cookies to

1345
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:01,560
make number Go up

1346
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:13,440
This is as she is I didn't think there would be a Cookie
clicker in this game I thought I'd just be running people

1347
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,900
over For hee hee ha ha

1348
01:44:19,300 --> 01:44:35,340
I've been making cookies I'm making thoughts oh my god I'm

I've never seen...

1354
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,520
It was all black and white.

1355
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:08,240
What do you mean there's a golden brain?

1356
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,420
It's all just black and white.

1357
01:45:15,220 --> 01:45:16,720
They've been floating around?

1358
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,960
Since when?

1359
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:21,980
Think hard.

1360
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:36,320

1361
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:47,460

the first time i ever saw a floating brain there it is i

1362
01:45:47,460 --> 01:46:02,780
didn't realize it existed we're almost there at 45 50
there's so many thoughts going in how many are 2000 oh my

1363
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:09,240

1365
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:34,340
i'm just gonna make another i'm gonna make another trolley
too at this point doing the trolley than waiting for the pub

1366
01:46:34,340 --> 01:46:43,980
because it's just so much more efficient okay i think i can
i think that's fine okay actually no we'll get there to 10k

1367
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:50,740
10 million 10 um 10 000 and then we'll invest in the pub
again

1368
01:46:54,670 --> 01:47:02,390
oh my look at how fast everything is going wait i missed
another one god damn it all these brains are so rare it's so

1369
01:47:02,390 --> 01:47:13,930
hard to find a brain come on give me another pub we're
almost there at 50 50 pubs guys what's the point we should

1370
01:47:13,930 --> 01:47:20,850
just return to monkey oh guys did you hear about oh yeah i
never talked about this fully okay i'll talk about mr beast

1371
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:25,650
because i've been wanting to talk about it but you guys hear
about okay first off the mr beast controversy the miss uh

1372
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:33,470
teeth gate so i talked about it i remember i talked a little
bit during the battlefield stream but like basically Mr.

1373
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:42,550
Beast has been like digitally altering his teeth during like
in all his videos for some reason um to make his like yeah

1374
01:47:42,550 --> 01:47:50,470
so it basically uh well one of his many controversies so
basically he's been like having his getting his editors to

1375
01:47:50,470 --> 01:47:59,330
make his teeth like whiter and like more like more like more
professional so whenever he smiles like you see that or even

1376
01:47:59,330 --> 01:48:06,590
like the thing is it's not veneers because it changes from
shots basically so why would he like randomly just take off

1377
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:13,790
his veneers in the next shot so um so like he's because like
the whole premise is that better teeth sell like makes like

1378
01:48:13,790 --> 01:48:19,790
better teeth in footage makes it so that people would watch
longer and i don't know i don't know i think that's such a

1379
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:27,910
weird concept to think about it's not consistent so you can
see random videos where when he smiles it's his actual teeth

1380
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:36,170
and then right after the next shot it's different teeth it's
it's wild i don't know it's such a wild concept and then

1381
01:48:36,170 --> 01:48:48,050
another thing i wanted to talk about is that he opened mr
beastland um in i think like in dubai so you guys didn't

1382
01:48:48,050 --> 01:48:56,950
know he opened his very own amusement park in dubai i
haven't watched the video footage of like um of like the

1383
01:48:56,950 --> 01:49:04,050
amusement park yet because I find it very like interesting
That he and people were like Why the fuck did you open it in

1384
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:04,410
Dubai?

1385
01:49:05,090 --> 01:49:08,650
And then okay, I know this is bullshit Or was it Saudi
Arabia?

1386
01:49:08,850 --> 01:49:10,470
Yeah, okay, it was in Saudi Arabia.

1387
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:16,510
So people were like asked Cause I know like there's also A
lot of amusement parks in Dubai as well But it was actually

1388
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:17,730
in Saudi Arabia.

1389
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:22,530
So people were like asking Why did you open it in Saudi
Arabia Instead of America?

1390
01:49:22,930 --> 01:49:29,430
And then like I know this is like such a PR response And he
was like, well, majority of my viewers are actually in the

1391
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:40,370
in Saudi Arabia in the in Middle East and I was just like oh
it is in yes Dubai is and yeah so they're like well majority

1392
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:53,210
of my viewers is uh I was just like that cannot be true that
me would not lie I was like there is no way majority of your

1393
01:49:53,210 --> 01:50:03,490
viewers are just say the money just say it was for the money
It's because he signed a million-dollar contract with, uh,

1394
01:50:04,010 --> 01:50:05,790
with Saudi Arabia.

1395
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:10,010
Um, um, yeah, Dubai is, oh, it's in the United Arab
Emirates.

1396
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:14,450
Okay, yeah, so I'm really bad at geography, but he signed a
million-dollar contract.

1397
01:50:14,710 --> 01:50:15,790
Oh, I forgot about the brain.

1398
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:18,530
Um, with them.

1399
01:50:18,710 --> 01:50:21,550
Two, uh, expand the entertainment sphere.

1400
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,730
So people were like, we know that's a bullshit reason.

1401
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:30,910
Show me, show me the analytic files, Mr. B.

1402
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:40,290
Yeah, so it's fucking wild.

1403
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:45,410
I saw, like, videos of people who actually went to Mr.
Beastland.

1404
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:51,350
Because, like, okay, but also, like, the footage, the
original footage, he should look so AI-generated.

1405
01:50:51,510 --> 01:50:53,350
Like, it did not look real.

1406
01:50:53,850 --> 01:50:59,730
I was just like, and then people were like, here's what it,
here's the footage that Mr. showed here's what it actually

1407
01:50:59,730 --> 01:51:11,390
looks like and it's so fucking different it looks so empty
yeah yeah i mean like kudos to him he actually went there to

1408
01:51:11,390 --> 01:51:18,650
film everything but it looks so fucking oh my god it is it's
like yeah it just looks like a it's just a carnival but they

1409
01:51:18,650 --> 01:51:27,890
just had like like the mr the what was it the fucking
panther imagery around it's so weird i won't i haven't I

1410
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:29,130
haven't watched the videos yet.

1411
01:51:30,230 --> 01:51:31,630
But I saw, like, clips of it.

1412
01:51:34,570 --> 01:51:40,090
But it's actually fucking wild that he, like, he built a
fucking amusement park.

1413
01:51:41,450 --> 01:51:45,030
He actually built a fucking amusement park there.

1414
01:51:45,970 --> 01:51:46,250
Madrid.

1415
01:51:46,350 --> 01:51:50,390
I didn't even, like, the thing is, he didn't say anything
until it was done.

1416
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:52,170
Like, no one knew about this.

1417
01:51:52,290 --> 01:51:54,550
And then suddenly he's like, guys, here's my amusement park.

1418
01:51:54,690 --> 01:51:55,890

1457
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:07,120
The Sims community aren't people.

1458
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:09,820
They have spent so much money.

1459
01:55:10,580 --> 01:55:10,860
Yay!

1460
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:11,980

I've won!

1462
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:19,700
The Sims girls are literally funding the entire stock market
of EA.

1463
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,940
We did it.

1464
01:55:23,200 --> 01:55:24,500
We saved the world.

1465
01:55:24,860 --> 01:55:26,920
You mean I could have left earlier?

1466
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,920
Oh my god.

1467
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,100
A trolley.

1468
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:41,780
is quickly approaching a baby lying on the tracks you have
the option to divert the file to different track where it

1469
01:55:41,780 --> 01:55:48,100
would hit five people this was saved the baby but make you
responsible for the death of the five however you should

1470
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:58,680
know that this baby will become a tariff okay okay okay okay
okay guys okay we know what we got to do we got we got we

1471
01:55:58,680 --> 01:56:03,140

live.

1472
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,700
There's no, it's like the, oh shit.

1473
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:07,160
Oh yeah, you can't show that.

1474
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:09,800
That baby had a good run.

1475
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:12,220
That baby had a good run.

1476
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:21,680
It's like how you don't be like, oh, if you could time
travel and go back and kill Hitler, would you do it?

1477
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:24,040
Like, they gave me the option, okay?

1478
01:56:24,580 --> 01:56:27,120
They gave me the option.

1479
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:31,440
If I let that, I don't, if I let that baby live.

1480
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:34,960
I saved millions of people.

1481
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:41,020
The train.

1482
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:43,940
The train that ended the war.

1483
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:47,760
A trolley is quickly.

1484
01:56:48,820 --> 01:56:52,800
Approaching five people tied to the tracks.

1485
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:55,920
You have the option to divert.

1486
01:56:56,240 --> 01:56:57,760
No, he had the butterfly effect.

1487
01:56:58,060 --> 01:57:01,900
Not that he's gotten another even more crazy dictator today.

1488
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:04,120
over and then it will be your fault.

1489
01:57:04,660 --> 01:57:04,660
Okay.

1490
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:10,280
Um, don't you believe in morally gray and redeemable
villains?

1491
01:57:10,640 --> 01:57:12,180
You could redeem that baby.

1492
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:12,740
Surely.

1493
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:13,540
Definitely.

1494
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:14,500
Patch your rest suit.

1495
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:15,380
Thank you for the super chat.

1496
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:15,700
Thank you.

1497
01:57:15,800 --> 01:57:17,240
What am I, Batman?

1498
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:19,600
None of his villains were redeemable.

1499
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:25,440
Um, you have the, they were cool, but they still killed
millions of people.

1500
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:33,740
Um, you have the option to divert the trot into different
tracks, saving the five howard this will create a new

1501
01:57:33,740 --> 01:57:35,520
trolley problem not my problem

1502
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:46,090
what would you not my problem if this is it's someone else's
problem there we go

1503
01:57:49,320 --> 01:57:56,540
what i mean that's your problem that's right you gotta deal
with that dilemma

1504
01:58:00,010 --> 01:58:12,570
problem is not mine not my trolley problem yeah double it
and pass it on to someone else a trolley is quickly

1505
01:58:12,570 --> 01:58:19,630
approaching people tied to the tracks you have the option to
divert the trolley to a free track you must redirect it to

1506
01:58:19,630 --> 01:58:26,050
avoid harming anyone can we reach their destination without
hurting more than five people also don't crash the trolley

1507
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:40,190
that should be fine that seems pretty easy i just gotta make

It's okay.

1518
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:06,970
Alright, I'm thinking in the future now.

1519
02:00:09,010 --> 02:00:09,730
There we go.

1520
02:00:10,390 --> 02:00:11,010
And then up.

1521
02:00:11,430 --> 02:00:12,290
And then down.

1522
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:13,670
And then down.

1523
02:00:13,890 --> 02:00:14,550
And then up.

1524
02:00:14,890 --> 02:00:15,890
And then up again.

1525
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:16,830
And then down.

1526
02:00:17,190 --> 02:00:17,930
And then down.

1527
02:00:18,030 --> 02:00:18,530
And then up.

1528
02:00:18,610 --> 02:00:19,610
And then up.

1529
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:20,550
And then down.

1530
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:21,590
And then down.

1531
02:00:21,830 --> 02:00:22,490
And then up.

1532
02:00:22,490 --> 02:00:25,570
I can go straight, right?

1533
02:00:25,750 --> 02:00:26,590
Yeah, nobody's going to.

1534
02:00:26,610 --> 02:00:27,430
gonna die here.

1535
02:00:28,170 --> 02:00:28,490
Here you go.

1536
02:00:28,810 --> 02:00:29,530
See, look at that.

1537
02:00:29,910 --> 02:00:33,290
I mean, I could have went up, but I didn't.

1538
02:00:37,810 --> 02:00:38,530
Oh, shit.

1539
02:00:39,390 --> 02:00:40,050
That's fine.

1540
02:00:40,230 --> 02:00:41,830
That's just one guy.

1541
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:45,330
That's fine.

1542
02:00:45,610 --> 02:00:47,530
That's just, that's just one guy.

1543
02:00:48,990 --> 02:00:50,670
Think about the thousands I saved.

1544
02:00:52,530 --> 02:00:53,690
Think about it.

1545
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:56,530
Think about the thousands of people I just saved.

1546
02:00:56,610 --> 02:01:06,810
not the four people I killed but the thousands of people I
oh just because I killed four people I'm the bad guy um

1547
02:01:06,810 --> 02:01:14,390
you're a conductor and your trolley is quickly approaching
five people tied to the tracks um you obviously have the

1548
02:01:14,390 --> 02:01:21,170
option to stop the trolley and save the five people however
you could also make the person next to that diversion lever

1549
02:01:21,170 --> 02:01:23,730
choose between letting Five people die.

1550
02:01:24,030 --> 02:01:26,450
We're actively killing one person.

1551
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:27,470
Not my problem.

1552
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:28,250
Like I said.

1553
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:30,630
Like, why should I make this my problem?

1554
02:01:32,070 --> 02:01:32,350
Alright.

1555
02:01:34,350 --> 02:01:35,010
Your conductor.

1556
02:01:38,210 --> 02:01:38,870
Oh, wait.

1557
02:01:39,070 --> 02:01:41,770
If I save the five, I won't kill.

1558
02:01:42,130 --> 02:01:42,670
Oh, okay.

1559
02:01:45,370 --> 02:01:46,350
What do I do?

1560
02:01:48,250 --> 02:01:49,470
Oh, I'm the kill.

1561
02:01:49,530 --> 02:01:51,130
Oh, I could have just stopped it.

1562
02:01:52,350 --> 02:01:54,110
I mean, I guess.

1563
02:01:56,710 --> 02:01:57,350
Oh.

1564
02:02:01,050 --> 02:02:03,710
Why didn't that guy do anything?

1565
02:02:08,910 --> 02:02:09,550
Wait.

1566
02:02:10,910 --> 02:02:12,450
Because I thought he would do something.

1567
02:02:13,390 --> 02:02:13,650
Okay.

1568
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:18,770
Okay, if I stop here, will I stop?

1569
02:02:19,630 --> 02:02:20,170
Oh.

1570
02:02:20,910 --> 02:02:22,330
I thought he would do something.

1571
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:29,350
I didn't realize it was up to me right on top.

1572
02:02:32,470 --> 02:02:34,310
Take the trolley for a spin.

1573
02:02:35,070 --> 02:02:35,930
Travel to the city.

1574
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:36,730
Pick up.

1575
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:38,290
I also wanted a better view.

1576
02:02:39,210 --> 02:02:42,950
I wanted a better view to see if he'll stop it.

1577
02:02:43,250 --> 02:02:45,330
He made his choice.

1578
02:02:46,590 --> 02:02:48,130
I did not pull.

1579
02:02:49,070 --> 02:02:49,930
That's on him.

1580
02:02:50,130 --> 02:02:51,590
He killed five people.

1581
02:02:51,710 --> 02:02:52,330
I saw that.

1582
02:02:52,350 --> 02:03:00,230
He didn't pull the lever so I try to stop so in the end I
was the good these people will remember that he didn't pull

1583
02:03:00,230 --> 02:03:08,790
the lever Travel to the city pick up passages and take them
to their destination It's time to enjoy a nice trolley ride

1584
02:03:08,790 --> 02:03:11,350
Oh wait, I get to actually drive the trolley.

1585
02:03:11,450 --> 02:03:11,870
Oh my god.

1586
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:16,590
It's the train simulator again How do I do this?

1587
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:18,650
Okay, that's the break.

1588
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:20,190
Okay, we gotta go forward

1589
02:03:26,120 --> 02:03:28,340
I saw two people still alive.

1590
02:03:29,780 --> 02:03:31,100
They're my witnesses.

1591
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:33,440
Two were still alive.

1592
02:03:34,840 --> 02:03:35,080
Hello.

1593
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:37,340
Oh, I didn't stop in in time.

1594
02:03:37,500 --> 02:03:39,560
Sorry, this is my first day on the job.

1595
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:43,280
The other times I was doing a fucking trolley problem.

1596
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,300
This is my first time actually driving the trolley.

1597
02:03:52,110 --> 02:03:52,550
All right.

1598
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:56,250
Why are most beatubers even?

1599
02:03:57,870 --> 02:04:05,930
Thousands of people but oh I murdered like one or two and
suddenly I'm the bad guy Like that just makes me human.

1600
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:07,870
It means I made a human error

1601
02:04:11,450 --> 02:04:13,610
I'm a real train conductor now

1602
02:04:17,010 --> 02:04:19,550
Oh guys, I'm gonna watch utopia today.

1603
02:04:20,030 --> 02:04:21,490
It's utopia too.

1604
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:22,870
I'm so excited

1605
02:04:27,870 --> 02:04:29,810
I'm going to watch Zootopia 2 today.

1606
02:04:34,720 --> 02:04:35,780
All right, here you go.

1607
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:38,940
All right, get in my train.

1608
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:41,180
Get in my trolley.

1609
02:04:41,420 --> 02:04:42,980
Yeah, the second one came out today.

1610
02:04:43,420 --> 02:04:44,260
You know what's crazy?

1611
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:50,160
Okay, apparently Zootopia is very, very popular and famous
in China.

1612
02:04:50,660 --> 02:04:52,660
That's why you see merch of it everywhere.

1613
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:55,520
And that's why the Zootopia said, what is it called?

1614
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:56,580
I forgot what is it?

1615
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,680
Oh yeah, it's called Zootopia.

1616
02:04:59,340 --> 02:05:00,100
Zootopia called?

1617
02:05:00,380 --> 02:05:00,660
Zootopia.

1618
02:05:01,500 --> 02:05:07,640
That's why they made a real Zootopia in, um, is it like in
Shanghai Disneyland?

1619
02:05:08,240 --> 02:05:09,860
Yeah, it's very popular in China.

1620
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,280
So that's why they built Zootopia in, in the Shanghai
Disneyland because of how popular Zootopia is.

1621
02:05:15,940 --> 02:05:20,600
And like, that's why you see merch of Judy and what's the
fox's name, Nick?

1622
02:05:21,240 --> 02:05:21,560
Everywhere.

1623
02:05:21,820 --> 02:05:30,580
Like he's, they're literally everywhere for merchandising
there um and um and the funniest thing is like you know how

1624
02:05:30,580 --> 02:05:37,560
apparently the main character is a snake one of the main
characters is a snake and he's the guy that did um the guy

1625
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:42,780
that played the uh what was it called everywhere blah blah
blah i can't remember the movie title it's such a long title

1626
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:50,360
um but you know that guy who got really famous um from that
one movie he did um but there's no merch of him anywhere

1627
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:55,720
because snakes aren't cute and it's so sad There's no merch
of...

1628
02:05:55,720 --> 02:05:58,240
You can't find any merch of him anywhere.

1629
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:00,380
Because like, people were like...

1630
02:06:00,380 --> 02:06:03,200
Like, the other animals are cuter.

1631
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:07,980
I was like watching, like, a video of people...

1632
02:06:07,980 --> 02:06:10,460
Like, this guy was like, I'm gonna try and find my favorite
character.

1633
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:12,060
Because he's my favorite actor.

1634
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:14,160
And, like, trying to find a snake.

1635
02:06:14,360 --> 02:06:15,760
And literally, like, none of...

1636
02:06:15,760 --> 02:06:18,660
Like, there was no merch of him anywhere.

1637
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:22,980
But he is literally the main...

1638
02:06:22,980 --> 02:06:25,120
The main character in the movie.

1639
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:27,820
Like, the whole film is based off of his story.

1640
02:06:31,820 --> 02:06:32,700
That's crazy.

1641
02:06:37,600 --> 02:06:38,140
Hey, Doki.

1642
02:06:38,260 --> 02:06:41,080
My brother was recently kidnapped and last seen near some
trolley tracks.

1643
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:42,300
Do you know anything about that?

1644
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:43,100
I hope he's okay.

1645
02:06:43,420 --> 02:06:44,500
Nope, not my problem.

1646
02:06:44,660 --> 02:06:46,120
Thank you for this super chat kill.

1647
02:06:46,240 --> 02:06:46,740
Thank you, thank you.

1648
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:47,800
That wasn't my...

1649
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:50,680
Not my schedule for today, you know.

1650
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:52,900
Not part of my schedule track.

1651
02:06:53,820 --> 02:06:54,880
You know how routes?

1652
02:06:55,060 --> 02:06:55,980
Not part of my route.

1653
02:06:56,420 --> 02:06:57,540
Sorry, bro.

1654
02:07:03,380 --> 02:07:03,820
Why?

1655
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:05,540
Are we...

1656
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:07,360
Oh, we got two more stations to go.

1657
02:07:11,850 --> 02:07:13,050
But I thought that was funny.

1658
02:07:13,230 --> 02:07:14,370
But no, Zootopia is like...

1659
02:07:14,370 --> 02:07:17,690
That's why you see, like, so much merch of Judy and...

1660
02:07:18,270 --> 02:07:19,890
Judy and Nick everywhere.

1661
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:22,010
They're, like, so popular.

1662
02:07:24,450 --> 02:07:25,090
Wait, can I...

1663
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:25,910
Oh, I didn't!

1664
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:27,230
Wait.

1665
02:07:29,310 --> 02:07:30,330
Let's even say choo-choo.

1666
02:07:31,770 --> 02:07:33,550
It just goes ring-ring-a-ding-ding.

1667
02:07:34,050 --> 02:07:34,850
Ring-a-ding-ding.

1668
02:07:36,930 --> 02:07:38,710
It just goes ring-a-ding-ding.

1669
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:41,250
Where is the other seat?

1670
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:41,970
Oh, there it is.

1671
02:07:42,110 --> 02:07:42,770
I didn't even realize.

1672
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:44,070
Oh, am I there?

1673
02:07:45,230 --> 02:07:46,210
All right, give me a sec.

1674
02:07:46,850 --> 02:07:47,290
There you go.

1675
02:07:48,070 --> 02:07:48,490
There you go.

1676
02:07:48,650 --> 02:07:49,290
All right, students.

1677
02:07:51,030 --> 02:07:53,230
Marshall, thank you for the super chat.

1678
02:07:53,550 --> 02:07:54,250
Thank you, thank you.

1679
02:07:55,550 --> 02:07:56,510
My god.

1680
02:07:58,090 --> 02:07:59,390
Thing is, I read...

1681
02:07:59,390 --> 02:08:00,910
Okay, that comic is wild.

1682
02:08:01,070 --> 02:08:01,710
I remember reading...

1683
02:08:01,710 --> 02:08:04,550
Okay, I won't fucking, like, be, like, ignorant.

1684
02:08:04,670 --> 02:08:06,670
I've read that comic when it first came out.

1685
02:08:06,730 --> 02:08:08,350
When it first, like, blew up in the internet.

1686
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:09,590
And it first came out.

1687
02:08:09,870 --> 02:08:13,230
So, the plot for, like, the artist is...

1688
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:16,730
That whole storyline is fucking wild.

1689
02:08:20,770 --> 02:08:21,730
Because, like...

1690
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:24,790
Because, like, it's wild.

1691
02:08:25,110 --> 02:08:33,570
Like, she becomes, Judy, like, dumps Nick and then, like,
hooks up with a female fox or another fox, but she's, like,

1692
02:08:33,630 --> 02:08:34,550
a female fox.

1693
02:08:35,110 --> 02:08:38,030
But she was, like, like, like a hooker.

1694
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:40,810
It's so, it's fucking wild.

1695
02:08:41,450 --> 02:08:43,110
It's such, it's so wild.

1696
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:49,070
They all leave?

1697
02:08:57,590 --> 02:08:58,370
All right, here we go.

1698
02:08:58,470 --> 02:08:59,730
Yay, we did it.

1699
02:08:59,870 --> 02:09:01,070
The trolley solution.

1700
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:02,370
Oh, is this the last level?

1701
02:09:06,220 --> 02:09:08,060
The year is 1967.

1702
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:12,040
The trolley is quickly approaching five people tied to the
tracks.

1703
02:09:12,720 --> 02:09:18,680
You have the option to divert the trolley to a different
track where wouldn't British philosopher Philippa foot?

1704
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:23,120
This would create a time paradox that would prevent the
trolley problem from ever existing.

1705
02:09:23,560 --> 02:09:29,020
Or you could do nothing and be cursed to solve the trolley
problem over and over again.

1706
02:09:29,640 --> 02:09:30,940
What would you do?

1707
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,760
I break.

1708
02:09:36,220 --> 02:09:54,520
I continue he did this to us he did this to us I know what
to do the fact that it's a woman does not change my oh shit

1709
02:09:54,520 --> 02:10:11,170
oh no what happened oh I broke the cycle guys I did it
freedom I did it.

1710
02:10:13,250 --> 02:10:14,190
It must have been her.

1711
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:17,230
She must have tied them all to the tracks.

1712
02:10:22,190 --> 02:10:24,690
Wait, what happens if I click start game?

1713
02:10:30,610 --> 02:10:32,110
There's no longer...

1714
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,490
There's no more problems.

1715
02:10:36,390 --> 02:10:38,050
The last ride of the day?

1716
02:10:38,050 --> 02:10:49,670
a trolley is calmly approaching the terminal nothing needs
to be done nothing to solve nothing to worry about just

1717
02:10:49,670 --> 02:10:59,310
relax and enjoy what remains of the ride oh my god i did it
important guys that i can't believe this game i bought only

thought this game would, I don't know, I really did think

1719
02:11:11,410 --> 02:11:13,510
that this game had more levels.

1720
02:11:13,730 --> 02:11:14,530
I can't believe it.

1721
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:18,770
I booted up this game and there was only one level, guys.

1722
02:11:19,330 --> 02:11:20,170
What happened?

1723
02:11:20,730 --> 02:11:20,730
Like,

1724
02:11:24,270 --> 02:11:28,910
wow, the stream was only 10 minutes long.

1725
02:11:29,550 --> 02:11:31,490
At least it's coming.

1726
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:35,290
The trolley had no problems.

1727
02:11:38,050 --> 02:11:48,270
two hours no i was talking to my chat for two hours and then
we went into the game and it was only one level straight up

Like, you gotta accept your baby's ugly.

02:12:53,500 --> 02:12:54,380
Like, don't lie.

1737

Because they give us a super chat.

02:12:58,300 --> 02:12:59,400
Thank you, thank you.

1739
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:00,660
Hi, Doki.

1740
02:13:00,840 --> 02:13:01,440
I just had a thought.

1741
02:13:01,820 --> 02:13:04,100
Imagine a trolley approaching five people tied to the
tracks.

1742
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:05,060
You're next to the lover.

1743
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:08,080
I divert the trolley to the track with only one person tied
to it.

1744
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:10,900
Would you pull up the, we gotta tie this guy to the track.

1745
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:21,380
guys we got he got we have to tie he's thinking too hard get
him guys thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

1746
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:29,300

1747
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:39,000

very well

1748
02:13:43,280 --> 02:13:44,940
Yeah, that was fun.

1749
02:13:45,340 --> 02:13:46,300
That was fun.

1750
02:13:46,600 --> 02:13:49,600
That was a little fun, a little one-off game.

1751
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:52,380
A lot of things I did not expect to happen.

1752
02:13:52,840 --> 02:14:01,660
I like the, I think my favorite, I think my favorite problem
in the trolley problem was definitely the one where, like,

1753
02:14:01,680 --> 02:14:08,360
your girlfriend cheated on you, but on your best friend, but
then your best friend didn't know, and also your best friend

1754
02:14:08,360 --> 02:14:08,960
has cancer.

1755
02:14:09,700 --> 02:14:12,120
I was just like, what the fuck?

1756
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:19,840
I think that one was the wild, that one was the hardest one,
and the most wildest question.

1757
02:14:20,060 --> 02:14:22,160
I was just like, oh, it keeps going on.

1758
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:29,220
But also, how would my best friend not know what my
girlfriend looks like?

1759
02:14:29,420 --> 02:14:36,640
Like how did I never show, I, I'm, bro, if, bro, if I would
tell my best friend, like, bro, I hooked up with someone

1760
02:14:36,640 --> 02:14:37,040
last day.

1761
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:42,360
Like, I would tell him or her, I would tell him, like, bro,
how would he not know?

1762
02:14:42,360 --> 02:14:55,420
like nah he definitely knew he fucking knew like sometimes
you just forget yeah your best friend was apparently also

1763
02:14:55,420 --> 02:15:10,540
blind but that was that was a really fun game oh i had a fun
time hanging out with uh my dragons uh with you guys and you

1764
02:15:10,540 --> 02:15:12,700
know going through a moral dilemma Emma.

1765
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:16,500
We learned a lot about me today.

1766
02:15:17,040 --> 02:15:17,620
Look, okay.

1767
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:20,220
I'll defend myself with the shopping cart.

1768
02:15:20,740 --> 02:15:29,320
If I see one of the teenagers, you know, when I do grocery
shopping and I see one of the teenagers like rolling around

1769
02:15:29,320 --> 02:15:37,820
in with their little car, I would leave the cart next to the
next to like the Uber car because I know that he's gonna

1770
02:15:37,820 --> 02:15:39,220
pick it up right after.

1771
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:51,220
So what is the point of me cart shopping cart to i'm to to
the area where you park it i saw i see the kid heading over

1772
02:15:51,220 --> 02:16:05,960
anyway i see the kid i am defending myself i am the cart
narc is gonna get you you toky that is wrong this is the

1773
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:09,140
worst thing you've ever done bro

1774
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:23,700
I'm just making sure you know like you know I see them there
and then you're just a bad person it's not like I leave it

1775
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:32,900
in the open like without anyone attending I see the kid
there and then I'd be like hey car and then I get in the

1776
02:16:32,900 --> 02:16:44,080
uber to Arkham prison with you I can't believe I'm someone
who would do that.

1777
02:16:44,480 --> 02:16:45,960
I feel so betrayed.

1778
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,340
I'm shaking and crying right now.

1779
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:55,180
We can forgive the murders, but the shopping cart, think
about the teenager.

1780
02:16:57,560 --> 02:17:00,060
Somehow that feels worse.

1781
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:00,920
Okay.

1782
02:17:01,300 --> 02:17:01,840
Hey, guys.

1783
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:08,160
I am gonna, I'm gonna call it here, guys.

1784
02:17:08,620 --> 02:17:09,580
I am gonna call it here.

1785
02:17:09,880 --> 02:17:21,000
I have I'll give you guys an update tomorrow on how how good
sutopia if sutopia 2 is good or not um, but don't worry

1786
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:21,240
guys.

1787
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:22,220
I'll give you guys an update.

1788
02:17:22,260 --> 02:17:25,460
I haven't been in a theater in a while So um, I don't know.

1789
02:17:25,500 --> 02:17:27,100
I haven't watched an animated film.

1790
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:27,700
Okay.

1791
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:34,860
It was either going to be wicked part 2 or sutopia 2 and
then I was just like I heard um wicked because like I

1792
02:17:34,860 --> 02:17:37,580
watched the first wicked in theaters.

1793
02:17:38,020 --> 02:17:47,920
I want to do like spoilers of the movie, but I did watch the
theaters, but I fucked up and watched it in, um, in 3D IMAX.

1794
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:52,320
And that was like a bad mistake because the colors were
already like pretty bad.

1795
02:17:53,260 --> 02:17:58,580
I don't know if you guys know about the joke about, uh,
Wicked, but it feels like there's no color grading at all.

1796
02:17:58,800 --> 02:18:00,400
And everything is just dull as fuck.

1797
02:18:00,680 --> 02:18:04,880
And then you put on top of it wearing 3D glasses on top of
it.

1798
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:13,260
Like all the colors are just super fucking dull and matted
um because the 3d glasses also like lowers the color like

1799
02:18:13,260 --> 02:18:20,880
darkens all the colors so it was it was like not a fun watch
for me just because everything was just so fucking dark um

1800
02:18:20,880 --> 02:18:31,180
so so i watched the first wicked because i do enjoy the
songs like i like i like the dancing tempana i like that

1801
02:18:31,180 --> 02:18:42,100
song and i like um i like uh what was the other one uh I
like that so that's why I watched it and then like the thing

1802
02:18:42,100 --> 02:18:49,400
is apparently in the second wicked movie um that's where
like the worst songs are in because all the good songs are

1803
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:55,700
in the first part one because that's also like Broadway the
musical where part one had all of that and then part two is

1804
02:18:55,700 --> 02:19:01,640
where all the fucked up like part two is where it gets super
fucking messy and like no one know what the fuck is going on

1805
02:19:01,640 --> 02:19:07,020
um so that's what they did in the second movie as well so I
read the reviews and people were like yeah know wicked part

1806
02:19:07,020 --> 02:19:14,680
two is a little what the fuck like and like none of the
there's like there's like no there's apparently not a lot of

1807
02:19:14,680 --> 02:19:21,700
good songs in part two um and because of that because they
put they they put it all in part one so all the like

1808
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:27,360
everything that people remember from wicked is from part one
and not from part two um but it's like people are saying

1809
02:19:27,360 --> 02:19:38,320
it's like more forgettable and then um and then uh how like
how like the scarecrow looks really fucking weird because

1810
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:44,340
he's supposed to be like Fiero Fiero or some shit and then
he has to be like like the like apparently he looks like

1811
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:51,300
Ryan Reynolds when he gets turned into a scarecrow like
that's what I heard people were like go bro what the

1812
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:58,980
scarecrow looks like Ryan Reynolds like apparently people
are like laughing about it um um it has for good though yeah

1813
02:19:58,980 --> 02:20:08,300
one song do you how many songs they were in fucking part one
so so i was just like oh man do i watch the second wicked

1814
02:20:08,300 --> 02:20:11,720
movie or zootopia 2 and i'm like zootopia 2.

1815
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:24,640
i was just like ah fuck yeah i watch i watch zootopia 2
because i was just like i want to watch a movie oh yeah yeah

1816
02:20:24,640 --> 02:20:28,000

Thank you.

1840
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:00,500

Finally.

1842
02:21:01,340 --> 02:21:03,000
I get to finally see Shakira again.

1843
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:03,500
Ole, ole.

1844
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,240
Hey, guys.

1845
02:21:06,320 --> 02:21:08,020
As always, everybody, stay hydrated.

1846
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:08,680
Posture check.

1847
02:21:08,820 --> 02:21:10,380
Get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

1848
02:21:10,540 --> 02:21:13,860
And if you stay up for me, head to bed because you deserve
it.

1849
02:21:14,580 --> 02:21:20,360
Oh, also, also, for those who are talking about the May
Cafe, you can send only out.

1850
02:21:20,460 --> 02:21:21,920
Have you got a weekend slot?

1851
02:21:22,240 --> 02:21:26,460
If you have a weekend slot, and you can have...

1852
02:21:26,480 --> 02:21:34,000
have said give gifts but it has to be letters and postcard
size um there is like an faq on the website that says

1853
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:39,820
exactly if you are going to go to the maid cafe it does say
like what type of gifts you're allowed to bring there is a

1854
02:21:39,820 --> 02:21:48,900
faq on there apparently um so uh and they said that gifts
should not exceed post the size of a postcard in length and

1855
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:51,900
height and should be small enough to fit in an envelope.

1856
02:21:53,640 --> 02:21:59,200
Several items include postcards, letters, keychains, pins,
stickers, buttons, and small items.

1857
02:21:59,500 --> 02:22:02,960
So, no, you can do other items, but it has to be small
items.

1858
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:07,660
So, you can give gifts, if only on weekends, only if you
have the weekend slots.

1859
02:22:08,440 --> 02:22:10,920
But yeah, that's what my manager said for those who were
there.

1860
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:16,120
But yeah, anyway, guys, like I said, as always, everybody,
stay hydrated, pause, check, get up, and move around to get

1861
02:22:16,120 --> 02:22:16,660
that blood flowing.

1862
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:18,880
And if you stay up for me, head to bed, because you deserve
it.

1863
02:22:18,980 --> 02:22:20,000
I'll see you guys next time, everyone.

1864
02:22:20,500 --> 02:22:20,900
Bye guys.

1865
02:22:21,320 --> 02:22:21,560
Bye.
