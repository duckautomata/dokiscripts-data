So I thought I was almost done with this game.

6
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,580

00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,880
very confident she's going to finish Hades 2 today.

8
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,160
And I'm like, why do you guys say that?

9
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,860
I don't understand.

10
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,440
I just have one more boss left.

14
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:07,080

17
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:34,100
this and then someone's like oh yeah good luck we're trying
to get six runs done i'm like i tried yeah i got changes i

18
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:41,580
had to i tried a fish all right so i originally wanted to
stream yesterday because you know um you know yesterday and

19
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,300
the day before yesterday were not like the actual like
christmas holidays so like people would be were free around

20
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:53,620
those times um because like you know christmas eve christmas
uh is like you know the time to spend with your family and

21
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:01,940
friends and stuff like that um and so a lot of people would
be super busy and everything um so but i did a costco run

22
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:11,880
yesterday because i was worried i won't have food for the
next two days i i know i got worried i was like oh man will

23
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,200
i have food the next two days i should i should do a costco
run um because i was worried that like you know a lot of

24
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,660
restaurants won't be like actually i didn't want to eat fast
food and i feel like a lot of like the good restaurants

25
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:31,520
would be like you know uh you have to book it in advance or
like they won't be like in service so i decided to do a

26
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:40,560
costco run uh yesterday i spent a lot of money at costco
yesterday i haven't gone to costco in a long ass time it was

27
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,660
funny though seeing to the you know the the food section
like nobody cares about what the fuck is going on by the way

28
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:55,240
while i was doing the costco i i got a lot of food so i'm
like practically stocked for the next two to three months

29
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:03,620
they're all my top freezer is just packed with food now um
um but yeah so i put everything in the freezer so it'll last

30
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:12,680
longer um anyway yeah at least like at least a month i have
at least one to two months worth of food i spent a lot i

31
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:25,680
think i spent like like 300 to 400 canadian dollars i was
just like oh i want this and i want that i'm like oh this is

32
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,440
so good i'm gonna get this oh they have swedish meatballs
yeah i got some swedish meatballs and um i got swedish

33
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:41,360
meatballs i got uh ground beef i got um i got uh Some oven
chicken bites.

34
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,560
I got, um, I got some, I got some cheese.

35
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
I love cheese.

36
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,960
Average Costco run.

37
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:58,000
I forgot the worst part is that I forgot they don't give you
bags for your, um, they don't give you bags for whenever you

38
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
do Costco runs.

39
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,960
So it was really awkward to, you know, Uber in and out.

40
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh yeah, I wanted to get the, I also got the classic
rotisserie chicken.

41
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,800
And I also got the you know the taco kit, too.

42
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,900
I got the taco kit.

43
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,680
I got the taco kit and also the rotisserie chicken and the
chicken salad Oh my god, because sometimes I would order

44
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,720
online For Costco, but every time I tried to I would try
they would have the rotisserie chicken But they won't have

45
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:34,420
the chicken salad because chicken salad is always sold out
whenever I try to order online So it's like it was so

46
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:41,280
fucking frustrating, but I finally got it because I was
actually there in person finally got my chicken salad anyway

47
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:52,360
uh yeah the taco kit so it comes with the the chicken the
the little uh the little tortilla wrap uh the uh the cheese

48
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:00,640
and then the cabbages um yeah i'm gonna survive canadian
winter guys i stocked up for winter a little too late but

49
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:10,400
it's okay i've got i i finally stocked up just a couple of
days before christmas yeah So, yeah, but someone was like,

50
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,240
yeah, but you got bought.

51
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,300
I forgot about the boxes.

52
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,080
So, um, it was a little awkward, like, taking the, because I
was like, all right, time to leave Costco.

53
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:26,120
And then the moment I was, like, like, heading to my Uber,
Uber driving, I was like, oh my God, wait, they didn't give

54
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,800
me bags.

55
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,060
So, I was just like, how the fuck am I going to carry this
back to my apartment?

56
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,520
Like, because it was just like a bunch of food.

57
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,680
Add no boxes.

58
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:45,720
It was just like, so I was just like, to the uber driver i
was like can you help like um i forgot to bring any bags or

59
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:55,400
boxes and like um can you help me bring it up to my
apartment door so we were just unloading back and forth like

60
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:07,240
to the elevator and then the elevator to my apartment door
and then i was like okay i i fucked up I mean that's I might

61
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,560
have fucked I was like I will give you a tip If you would
help me I'll give you a big tip If you would help me Unload

62
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,040
my groceries No I didn't even bring a little wagon I forgot
all about that I was just like I should get some food Before

63
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:33,200
the holidays roll in So I don't fucking stif Oh by the way
It didn't even matter Because I forgot I don't have baking

64
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:45,280
trays so i today today i uber eats baking trays because i
forgot to get baking trays because like i bought those like

65
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:53,860
oven uh prep meals um like the salmon with the little crab
cakes in the middle um and the bell pepper with the rice and

66
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:06,280
the uh uh and the meat and stuff and i was like oh fuck i'm
i don't have i don't have a baking tray how am I gonna put

67
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:16,820
this in the oven so today today before the store closes I am
uber eating um baking tray plus also I ran out of rice so I

68
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:26,340
got it I ran out of rice and pasta sauce so like my whole
plan like basically because like you know I would like to

69
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:37,660
have like something to go with my like my protein so I don't
have aluminum foil as well so so today i i thought i thought

70
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:47,100
my plan was solid so today i have to uber eats rice pasta
sauce because i have pasta i just don't have sauce with it

71
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:55,200
um and i could use like insta ramen but that's just a little
sad you know i've got i bought like like a 400 grocery bill

72
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:05,160
and i used fucking insta ramen uh with my food um so yeah so
i got i got some that for i knew i knew i should have got a

73
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:12,760
i knew i should have made a list i just went in there with
vibes i was like i i was like i i will feel what i need and

74
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:27,140
clearly vibes did not work out for me i should have been a
little more organized um anyway uh yeah never use vibe to

75
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:35,920
shop um also i was looking at pcs there holy but okay so you
know how there's a issue by the way um something came up on

76
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:45,060
my twitter but apparently it's cheaper to buy a gun than it
is to buy ram now which is a crazy statement to make but

77
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,640
it's true i saw a tweet that was like the fact that 64
gigabytes of ram for a gaming computer now costs more than

78
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:03,860
ar15 is pretty fucked up just like all back but i was
looking at like the pc section and it's so funny because all

79
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:12,180
the pc they were displaying um they took out the ram it
looked like they were people were worried that people were

80
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,700
gonna steal the ram in the pre-built PCs that were on
display because i was looking through it and i was like

81
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:29,400
where the fuck is the ram like the ram sticks were god and i
was And it was like the pre-built PCs were like $1,000 for

82
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,800
like 32 gigabytes of RAM.

83
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,360
And I was like thinking, oh my God, I could just buy this
pre-built PC, deconstruct, take the RAM, and then sell.

84
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,220
I swear to God, people are actually doing that in Costco.

85
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:53,500
Like they would just go to Costco, buy the pre-built PC,
stock up, like stock it up like Pokemon cards.

86
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,000
I swear to God, I am not the first person to think of this.

87
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:04,600
Like, stock it up like Pokemon cards, wait a couple of
months, and then sell the RAM out.

88
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,500
Big brain.

89
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:11,000
Bro, it was 32 gigabytes of RAM in the PC.

90
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,700
Okay, for $1,000 and you get a entire PC with the PC is
bonus.

91
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
The RAM is what you're aiming for.

92
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,700
Like, new scalping meta drop.

93
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:34,860
yeah i'm pretty sure people have flipped those pre-builds
before uh that's my retirement money i was like thinking

94
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:44,020
about it um yeah i'm buying the ramp and it comes with a
free pc anyway also very important announcement today um

95

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,780

nice of him um because we haven't talked in a while since

really nice that he went online just like went back like he

that uh snow miku is um is in the shop so i hope he did get

108
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:42,940
it um anyway actual important Tomorrow is the Christmas
party.

109
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,320
So for the Christmas party, I did post a schedule on Twitter
and a community post.

110
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,780
Let me put the schedule out right now.

111
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,140
Oh my gosh, I'm like stalling so much when I really need to
beat this game.

112
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,240
I have very limited time to fucking beat this game right
now.

113
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,640
So I did post a schedule, but here is a little schedule
reminder for everyone to look up.

114
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,220
It is on the YouTube community post and on Twitter.

115
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,320
Starts at 3 and potentially ends at maybe around 1 a.

116
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,020
I'm going to try and do an 11 hour stream.

117
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:23,620
I would do longer if my rest of the next two weeks is not
absolutely fucking packed as hell.

118
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,720
It is very packed right now.

119
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,700
So I was like 11 hours will be like the goal.

120
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,760
But I felt like 11 hours is pretty good for everyone around
the world to be able to drop by whenever they want.

121
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:46,080
and everything so uh from different times so it's being a
drop in and out whenever they can uh for the christmas

122
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:55,520
stream um so it starts at 3 p.m p.sc yeah i was gonna say do
i start at 3 i had to remind myself do i actually start and

123
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:02,300
then we have for the gaming with dragoons sections i did try
to pick games that are free to play um or like very cheap

124
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,320
you know some mind like people already have minecraft it's
pretty cheap and also a lot of people already have minecraft

125
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:15,020
accounts too like random you know like those like as random
smp servers that anyone can join and stuff like that maybe

126
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:22,080
we'll just like raid a server and just make it just like
raid some port guys for a server and be like play bed wars

127
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:34,960
or some shit we could do stuff like that um and obviously
this is a guideline not a not a strict schedule and uh so uh

128
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,340
we won't be following it to the t maybe we'll do something a
bit longer or do something a bit shorter maybe we'll pivot

129
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:45,220
to something else randomly maybe there will be another game
or another thing i want to do in the middle like that's

130
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:53,400
doesn't follow the schedule so it's like it's just a
guideline it's we're just vibes vibes will work eventually

131
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,980
um but we do have a guideline um so all of that uh also
we're going to do what's the word we're like is it the

132
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:09,340
honors code we're like um if uh you guys make sure to like
um if you do match join in a session for uh the gaming

133
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:16,580
session uh please for the next uh let other dragoons have a
chance to also play with me so uh try to aim for just like

134
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:23,840
yeah honor system we'll do it in honor system so let other
dragoons have a chance to play with me um because i want

135
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:30,680
everyone to have a chance to join in on the fun as well uh
yeah so we uh just like don't join in the next session if

136
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:38,440
you already played with me type deal um but in that that's
basically the guideline for uh tomorrow's stream um i know

What's the word?

156
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,540
You're just sensitive to like try and force yourself to be
there for the entire stream.

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,340
Feel free to just drop in and out whenever you guys are
free.

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:06,120
um let's all have fun you know uh f1 welcome to tomato farm
welcome welcome yeah i think like in the past when i was

160
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:12,500
growing up the only thing i really did for christmas it was
we would have i think this is an asian thing but like i

161
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:20,720
don't know like a lot of asian people relate to this but the
the fucking christmas buffet dinners every time it's

162
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:30,400
christmas it's like my my Asian parents would be like this
is the the perfect opportunity to get a buffet yeah it's

163
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:48,100
like it's always a buffet it's always a Christmas buffet
yeah it's like this is the perfect time always the crabs hmm

164
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:54,400
that's usually like what my parents would always do for what
It's always my family as well.

165
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:55,780
Extended family as well.

166
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,500
What we'll always do for Christmas is just go straight to
the go for buffet.

167
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,740
Christmas buffet time.

168
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,440
To be fair, like the Christmas buffet is really fucking
good.

169
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,800
To be fair.

170
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,020
All right, what else?

171
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,340
What else do I want to guys update you guys about?

172
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,460
Let me double check before we...

173
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,260
Oh yeah, love the Christmas market.

174
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,400
Had a great time at the market.

175
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,540
bought a lot of stuff, ate a lot of really good food.

176
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,140
There was a line for these, like, what are they called?

177
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:38,480
They're like, I don't know what European country it is, but
it's like these cake cones.

178
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:46,320
And apparently it's like a traditional European snack, like
dessert, where the ice cream is in a cone that's like

179
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,560
basically made out of cake.

180
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,960
But I wasn't able to get it because the lines were way too
fucking long.

181
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,700
Like the chimney.

182
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,020
Yeah.

183
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,300
Oh, yeah.

184
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,980
It's called chimney.

185
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,360
I don't fucking remember it.

186
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,600
I was, I was eyeing it too for a long time.

187
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,220
I was like, ooh, I don't get it.

188
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,220
I was like, I'll come back when the line was shorter.

189
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,480
It's shorter.

190
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:06,100
The line never became shorter.

191
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,400
I came back every couple of, like, like every like 30
minutes or so.

192
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,600
I would come back just to see if you're like, oh, it's the
line shorter now.

193
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,640
It never became shorter.

194
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:26,540
And then when it was about to close the Christmas market,
the line, was still looping, and I'm like, okay, I'm just...

195
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,980
I'm just gonna leave now.

196
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,800

I bought dad a taco collar.

208
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,720
There was a little dog stall.

209
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,320
And they were selling like collars and bandanas.

210
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,060
And I found a collar that had tacos on it.

211
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,740
And I was like, I gotta get this for dad.

212
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,480
I really wanted to bring him to the Christmas market.

213
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,740
But like also there were a lot of children there.

214
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,620

Oh, yeah, almost forgot.

228
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,380
I am debating whether or not to do multi streaming too for
the Christmas stream Because like I said, you know, um, it's

229
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:39,080
for like all the dragoons out there who you know want some
company Um as a community and I was thinking like, you know,

230
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,940
usually I like I said, I don't do multi streaming But I
figure since it is a Christmas stream, I did debate whether

231
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:54,400
or not to do it Um, and like I said, I'm mostly um it's
going to be a lot of work looking at two chats but i figured

232
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,340
you know like since it's the holidays i figured it might be
a good time to try out multi-streaming but like i said it's

233
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,400
not like going to be a common thing i just thought it would
be a special occasion to do it just so uh you know uh keep

234
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:14,460
the dragons on both platforms like uh company as well um but
we'll see we'll see how i feel what do you guys think you

235
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:23,040
think i should do multi-streaming for tomorrow for the
Christmas stream a Christmas miracle it's my Christmas

Oh yeah.

250
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,110
Apparently like it's not pronounced tortillas.

251
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:47,990
Um, I have a friend that got really mad at me for saying
tortillas because it's supposed, you don't pronounce the L.

252
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,450
It's like, or is it tortillas?

253
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,310
I don't remember how I pronounced it.

254
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,050
I was like, I was like, oh, I love tortillas.

255
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,590
And they're like, what the fuck did you say?

256
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:03,490
I pronounce it like that.

257
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,170
Tortillas.

258
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,910
What the fuck did you just say?

259
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,650
Yeah, so I pronounced it tortillas or tortillas.

260
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,470
Is it both wrong?

261
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,410
Is it both wrong?

262
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,030
Is it okay?

263
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:31,720
You're talking to a person who pronounced quesadillas
quasadillas for like seven years before I got to...

264
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,010
Are they...

265
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,890
Before...

266
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,410
I used to pronounce quesadillas?

267
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,730
Quasadillas.

268
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,670
Can I get some quasadillas, please?

269
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,330
Can I get chicken quasadilla?

270
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:43,470
Quasadilla?

271
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,490
Because I lived in Asia and no one corrected me when I would
ask.

272
00:26:51,510 --> 00:27:01,410
for a chicken quesadilla and then when i got to university
as my friend and i were ordering at a restaurant and she was

273
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:08,630
like what do you want i was like i think i'm gonna get a
chicken quesadilla and then she was like um you mean a

274
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:17,110
quesadilla and i was like what what are you talking about

275
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:23,530
What?

276
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:24,410
What?

277
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,170
No, no.

278
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,450
Isn't it quasadilla?

279
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:33,430
Sorry.

280
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,110

Thank you.

287
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,670
Keep pronouncing like that because of the rage of hate.

288
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:47,990
Thank you.

289
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:49,750
Thank you.

290
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,490

Thank you.

293
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,630
Don't keep being very Canadian.

294
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,790
I rarely eat Mexican food, but these chicken quesadillas
things ain't half bad.

295
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,470
Thank you for the super chat.

296
00:27:59,710 --> 00:27:59,830

298
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,030
Oh, yeah.

299
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,070
Also, apparently in Canada, our chicken tacos ain't right.

300
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:16,630
So the tortillas, the tortillas and the tortillas, they're
white.

301
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:20,550
And like, apparently they're not supposed to be white.

302
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:25,590
Like, that they're supposed to be yellow because I was like,
what do you mean?

303
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:28,650
My, like, I was like, I was like to one of my friends.

304
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:32,070
I was like, look, I bought chicken tacos, the taco kit.

305
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,710
And, and, uh, and ours is white.

306
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,770
So, like, in Canada, they're white.

307
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,590
And, uh, and then, um, one of my friends were like, what
the, why is it white?

308
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,970
And I was like, what do you mean?

309
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:55,530
So, apparently, um, They're supposed to be yellow because
it's like a different ingredient or something.

310
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:59,010
Yeah, like the traditional is like corn or some shit.

311
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,190
So that's why it's yellow.

312
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,090
But like in Canada for Costco, ours is white.

313
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,770
So ours is flour.

314
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,070
Oh yeah, it's flour, right?

315
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:11,610
Yeah.

316
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,330
Or ours is flour.

317
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:20,530
But in American Costco, they use corn for their...

318
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:27,150
for their tortillas so that's why they're like yellow but in
canada we use flour because i don't know i guess we just

319
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:34,450
don't have enough corn or something we just i don't know we
just don't have enough corn i don't know but for some reason

320
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:45,270
canadian costco uses white white uses flour instead it's
just look down hun yeah

321
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:58,330

Okay.

337
00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:00,130
I can name three Canadian provinces.

338
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,210
Quebec is one, right?

339
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,090
No, Quebec is in a pro- wait.

340
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,710
It's Quebec a province.

341
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,050
They want, they want to be.

342
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:12,750
Okay.

343
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,350

Wait, is Quebec a province?

345
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,630
Okay, Quebec.

There you go.

348
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,970
Quebec, are you talking about Quebec City or whatever?

349
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,290
Okay, Quebec is one of them.

350
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,290
It's not looking so good.

351
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,310
See, I can name three provinces.

352
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,930
Quebec, British Columbia, and Saskatchewan.

353
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,470
Wait, is that tarot?

354
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,750
Yeah, there we go.

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,130
There we go.

356
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,990
I always remember Saskatchewan.

357
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:11,550
Because Saskatchewan is like the is like the Alabama of
Canada because it's all about farming.

358
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,510
Wait, is Alabama about farming?

359
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:21,850
I just I just Is Alabama the farm is that's where all the
farmers are too, right?

360
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,330
Or is that also Kansas?

361
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,190
Is that also Kansas?

362
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,090
No?

363
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:29,310
Okay, Saskatchewan is like the farming province.

364
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,450
That's what I remember.

365
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:34,410
Where I just remember Saskatchewan a lot.

366
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,050
And I don't know.

367
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,850
Okay, wait.

368
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,530
What's the farming state in America?

369
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:46,690
What the?

370
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:47,190
Oh, okay.

371
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:55,970
Saskatchewan is like the Kansas of Canada because that's
where all the farmers live I mean that's where they're like

372
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:02,950
the the farming is focused on I mean there's farmers
everywhere in Canada but like Saskatchewan is where we focus

373
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:17,910
the farming shit so I don't know Ohio or something okay okay
Saskatchewan is the Midwest of America but for Canada So

374
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:19,290
that's what Saskatchewan is.

375
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,990
And that's why I remember Saskatchewan.

376
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:24,630
And I remember Quebec because Quebecois.

377
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,290
And then I remember British Columbia because West Coast.

378
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:38,090
It's like, oh yeah, you know Canada named three provinces.

379
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,450
Bam, three provinces.

380
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,430
I don't know how many provinces are in Canada, by the way.

381
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,710

Thank you.

383
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,670
I think we didn't rage bait enough demographic say something
about Europe.

384
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,950
I think it can name more European countries than I can name
That can name American states.

385
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,370
There's too many.

386
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,030
There's 50 states.

387
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,990

You're in a coma chat isn't real Saskatchewan isn't real.

393
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:13,790
Quebec isn't real.

394

395
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:15,650

Thank you.

399
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,110
This is now geography stream instead of like gaming stream.

400
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,150
Thank you for the super chat.

401
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:27,570
Thank you.

402
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,490
Thank you.

403
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:32,610
I wanted to say something else, but I already forgot.

404
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,170
Yeah, no.

405
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,070
What do you mean rest in peace East Coast?

406
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,450
Quebec is East Coast.

407
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,510
It's literally the other side of the country.

408
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:50,750
I literally named Mid Coast, East Coast and And West Coast,
those were the three provinces.

409
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,340
I'm on a watch list now.

410
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:07,200
John, in the super chat, did you think Canadian educational
education system failed this year?

411
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,320
No, no, no.

412
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,920
Because my international schools follow the American
education system.

413
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:26,040
To be fair, because I was in an international school, school
we learn we focus more on general world history than like

414
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:34,840
focused on like specific countries we just learn like world
history so so like that's why i have lots of information

415
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:42,160
gaps like i have a general knowledge of the world but not
specific things so that's why there's a huge gap of a lot of

416
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:53,000
things when it comes to when you get when it comes to like
naming specific stuff and school so like we couldn't focus

417
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:02,100
on a particular country so it was more so like let's learn
about world history and the war is and everything whoa yeah

418
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:12,360
like I learned about like the war is the like the world wars
I learned about the Cold war I learned about like the the

419
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:24,760
wars that included everyone because we have to be very
inclusive about like you know the world history so we didn't

420
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:37,080
focus on specific stuff it was something i want to talk
about but forgot what it was oh well maybe i'll come back to

421
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:46,280
me uh all right guys okay we have to finish this game we
can't we'll talk about this tomorrow What am I talking

422
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,220
about?

423
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,120
Guys, wait, was I using controller?

424
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,000
Mouse and keyboard.

425
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:50,700
Mouse and keyboard.

426
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,100
Yeah, I felt like it's been a while since I played, so I had
to, like, remind myself.

427
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,500
Alright.

428
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,200
Mouse and keyboard time.

429
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,560
Guys, I have six runs to do.

430
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,960
Like, if I succeed in all six runs.

431
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,340
God, be safe.

432
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,520
We can learn about history tomorrow on Christmas.

433
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,240
I'll get that blasted Typhon for this, Freenos.

434
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,040
Just you watch.

435
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,820
All right, here we go.

436
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,540
I know.

437
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,360
How's it going on Olympus recently?

438
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,360
Or wherever you were last night.

439
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,920
See anything good up there besides the snow?

440
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
Not sure how come I know about snow.

441
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,080
I made it all the way to the summit where I confronted the
ancient monster called Typhon.

442
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,180
It said that all of the monsters can be traced directly to
him.

443
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,240
But he's by far the biggest and the worst I've ever seen.

444
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,360
Let's hope this is the next run I fucking beat him.

445
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:52,960
I hope to God, because then I'll be another plus one.

446
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,040
All right, let's go.

447
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:00,980
Okay.

448
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,600
Oh, my God.

449
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,180
Now, well, okay, time to pick up some scraps.

450
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,260
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

451
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,020

452
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,720
Denied.

453
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,600
I wonder what this is.

454
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,240
I've always wondered what this story goes to.

455
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,240
to have our aimless clashes only then to sneer at one
another here again and again such a worthy cause i got

456
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:33,760
someone's like how many successful surface runs has dokey
done that's funny don't worry about it don't worry about it

457
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:49,200
you should ask that after the stream when we beat the game
you're unbelievable guys how do we tell them Oh, frozen

458
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,540
life.

459
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,520
Ooh, hey, something new.

460
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,920

A place to restore HP?

462
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,900
That's always good.

463
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,020
Oh, where did...

464
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,340
Where did Hekatee go?

465
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,700
Alright, let's grab some plants real quick.

466
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,580
We gotta keep growing.

467
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,620
Gotta grow, grow, grow.

468
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,120
I don't know.

469
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,040
Grow a plantain.

470
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,480
I don't think we need it, but I'll just grow it just in
case.

471
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:21,920
been quite concerned i'm not lagging right confrontations
with typhon reckon you never trained to take opponents of

472
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:32,280
that size oh i trained just last night hi that's good um the
only issue about like having a 500 hertz monitor and then

473
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:41,960
also um i i have a 240 hertz on the for my second monitor
but like i put it on 60 hertz instead of you know 240

474
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:48,040
because it's apparently not good to have all your monitors
maxed out on hertz because it'll like drain your power or

475
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:54,260
some shit i don't fucking know the the tech details about it
so because of that sometimes when i look at my obs it looks

476
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:03,980
like i'm lagging but it's just the hertz difference they say
a lot of things god is why are you doing with 500 hertz

477
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:13,280
playing fps games it's it's actually really good with fps
games or aiming games

478
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:21,710
Yeah, there's no point having more Hertz on a second
monitor, but it does look like I'm lagging when I look on my

479
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:23,770
second monitor on my OBS.

480
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,190
It like fucks with me.

481
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,710
It actually does benefit a lot to have like higher Hertz
monitor for like competitive shooters.

482
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,530
Got yet another Titan up against us, huh?

483
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,070
Prometheus.

484
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,530
One of the smart ones, so they say.

485
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,070
And now, an enemy could have been on our side had your
family.

486
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:55,830
not you know oh yeah locked him up and then have an eagle
eat his kidney every day i don't know you know i thought

487
00:41:55,830 --> 00:42:02,490
he'll forgive me you know yes the whole chain into a
mountain so an eagle or liver sorry it's almost the same

488
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:09,030
thing not one of the proudest moments on olympics i have to
imagine yeah but now he gains a best friend is it really

489
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,670
that bad if he made a friend along the way i gave him a
lifelong friendship

490
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:20,970
Watch with the treason, Nem.

491
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,030
Mint says a lot of things, guys.

492
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,650
If you follow everything Mint says,

493
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:36,570
might not be ideal for health reasons.

494
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,290
All right.

495
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:48,630
Let's see.

496
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:59,330
get anything right now i only have one insight also um i
mean i could buy this doesn't really matter but i can buy at

497
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:08,970
least i need more than i have to while you just join it up
commander how am i to overcome a foe whose life force is

498
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:16,450
completely undetectable typhon the bringer of storms
conceals his strength from me but it must have its limits

499
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:23,950
you know young one most of us We just hit each other till
somebody ends up dead.

500
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:26,770
Maybe there's signs like cuts and bruises and whatnot.

501
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,250
He's not impervious.

502
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,350
The gods have vanquished him before you.

503
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,190
Yeah, I could do it.

504
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:34,470
All right.

505
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,490
I am a little worried.

506
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:39,550
Okay, wait, what's my...

507
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,770
What's my...

508
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:41,910
Is it...

509
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:46,070
Someone said Cersei is also really good against him, but I
don't know.

510
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:49,890
Try to use Cersei or Momis.

511
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:51,270
Guys.

512
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:59,550
I think Momus has been doing very well for me, but like,
what is the most ideal, like, aspect for you guys?

513
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:00,290
For Typhon.

514
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:01,930
Oh, I should grab this.

515
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,350
Uh, I'll get money first.

516
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:07,090
Uh, maybe I'll, you know what?

517
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:12,610
Hmm, where is someone said, maybe...

518
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:17,410
Who was the best Cersei with cast build?

519
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,130
Momus is easier to use.

520
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:24,230
Momis has been like, good for me.

521
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,730
Easy double cast spam.

522
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:31,490
But they're both good.

523
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,490
Oh, I'll try Cersei's for this one.

524
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:36,710
We'll see how it goes.

525
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,490
Dish the damn cat.

526
00:44:38,650 --> 00:44:40,130
But he's been amazing.

527
00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:43,410
He's been hitting people.

528
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,810
And I get death defiance.

529
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,690
I need another death defiance.

530
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,010
Alright, what should we get for the first town?

531
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,250
The cat is good.

532
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:56,570
good.

533
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:57,010
I know.

534
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:57,990
I love the cat.

535
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:01,930
We have a Zeus cast?

536
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:02,430
Okay.

537
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,730
Uh, where's Zeus?

538
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:05,550
Okay, there you go.

539
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,610
We'll get the cloud bangle for that then.

540
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,230
Okay, so is this a...

541
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,970
Alright, there you go.

542
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:13,630
There's my cat.

543
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:14,550
Me and my cat.

544
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,890
Alright, here we go.

545
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:17,810
Wake up, cat.

546
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:18,410
It's time.

547
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,570
We're going to the surface.

548
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:23,150
No holding back.

549
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:24,070
Oh, hey!

550
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,970
Just when I got the Zeus Yeah, uh, let's use Memento.

551
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,030
Good timing.

552
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:35,230
What's that quote?

553
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:36,350
Wake up, bitch.

554
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,750
We're going shopping?

555
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,410

556
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:44,210
He's no master.

557
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,160
Okay, here you go.

00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:47,630
Uh, okay.

00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:48,430
Okay, wait, attack.

Yeah, that's the quote, right?

572
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,090
Okay, you gotta wake up though for this.

573
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:58,530
Oops, I used it too early.

574
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,130
Okay, I need a rummer to wake her up if I use this cast.

575
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:13,730
Trim, welcome to Tamia Farm.

576
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:14,470
Welcome, welcome.

577
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:18,990

Oh, hey, okay, you're a cast.

579
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,930
I don't want scorched for my cast, though.

580
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,210
Yeah, I don't want scorched for it.

581
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:29,950
I hated that.

582
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,010
Maybe my special?

583
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,990
Oh, my special launches, but...

584
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:42,310
Yeah, I'll try to forget Zeus or I'll do try to get Zeus or
what's her?

585
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:53,590
Or Aris the city of a fear which once stood in solemn
tribute to the fear-inducing underworld king and queen Now

586
00:47:53,590 --> 00:48:06,210
barely stands at all Yet it stands in my way What oh money

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,150
Okay, hammer.

589
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:12,790
Moon.

590
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,470
We'll grab Moon first.

591
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:16,690
I'll grab a moon.

592
00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:19,330
I forgot I'll play this game.

593
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:22,910
Okay, where are you?

594
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:23,850
You gotta wake up.

595
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:25,030
Oh my god!

596
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,190
I told you to wake up!

597
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,630
Not!

598
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:28,230
Oh my god.

599
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,090
Okay, that's bad.

600
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:30,730
That's bad for me.

601
00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:33,670
I messed up.

602
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:34,990
I got the sword.

603
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:39,150
distracted I told my cat to wake up.

604
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,790
I got very distracted

605
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,260
Moon lend me your light

606
00:48:50,540 --> 00:49:01,780
Yeah, if he's died before we can do it again Yet I hold to
every faith you shall so I'm getting distracted All right,

607
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:08,560
your hex launches your hex makes you rash up rise up your
hex blasts Oh, they're all pretty bad.

608
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,560
Guys, they're all...

609
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:16,820
Yeah.

610
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:18,380
I don't know.

611
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,840
These are all pretty fucking shit.

612
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,140
I guess Eclipse would be good for endgame.

613
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:25,680
Okay, this is...

614
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,760
We gotta...

615
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,980
Wait, this is for endgame.

616
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:32,830
Alright.

617
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:33,990
We have...

618
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:35,630
At least we have endgame, yeah.

619
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,170
Might as well.

620
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:41,570
Nice.

621
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,770
We got some rooms, too, which is always nice.

622
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:47,610
There you go.

623
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:51,850
Oh my god, I need a room for the cast.

624
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,350
Alright, nice.

625
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:54,530
We have at bones.

626
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:57,150
Oh!

627
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,210
Alright, we gotta survive early game, yeah.

628
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:06,010
But it's a good, like, we get health back in the tiny rooms,
too, which is nice.

629
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:08,450
Alright, what are the other places?

630
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:14,670
Grab hammer, Zeus again, and then trap build after.

631
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:17,370
I'll use my free will for a little bit here.

632
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:22,850
Oh, there was a transform.

633
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:24,690
Oh.

634
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,290
Whoops.

635
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,630
I don't even remember what the transfer.

636
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,850
All right, maybe free will was a mistake.

637
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,430
Oh, no, not free will.

638
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,470
The GG free will.

639
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:45,850
How many of these do I have?

640
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,140
Where's my cat?

641
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,640
Wake up.

642
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,590
Cat, wake up.

643
00:50:58,410 --> 00:50:59,750
Guys, I just need a warm-up.

644
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,230
I just need a warm-up.

645
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:08,420
Alright, what's this?

646
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,340
Taxier.

647
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:09,740
Ooh!

648
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,180
Your dash strike hits a larger area.

649
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,800
Oh, but that's good too.

650
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,640
Wait, guys, one or three?

651
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,360

They're both pretty good.

658
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:37,240

Remember to check out the community post guys.

662
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,520
I didn't check if there were rooms unlocked I got distracted
by shilling.

663
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,420
I shilled too hard.

664
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:04,480

00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:16,300

00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,780
Okay, I'm just gonna destroy this real quick.

669
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:31,520
Oh, shit!

670
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:32,100
What?

671
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,180
It's fine.

672
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,360
Everything is fine.

673
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,440
I shill too close to the sun.

674
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,320
Ooh!

675
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:45,280
Three.

676
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,180
Right?

677
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,300
Yeah, all right, three.

678
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:56,660
Now to head back.

679
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,440
All right, no extra room.

680
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,540
Go free will.

681
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:02,900
All right.

682
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,920
All right, guys.

683
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,040
Chat fill time.

684
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:05,960
No more free will.

685
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:06,700
Where do we get?

686
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:07,300
What do we get?

687
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,480
We have.

688
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,040
We do have Apollo at the bottom.

689
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:15,200
We have Apollo and Poseidon at the bottom here.

690
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:15,560
See?

691
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:16,760
Right there.

692
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,420
We're at HP next.

693
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,860
HP Apollo.

694
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,880
Okay, we'll go there.

695
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,320
We're still missing three.

696
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,460
Okay, HP Apollo.

697
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,720
Like I said, this is my first run, so I'm warming up right
now.

698
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,980
Okay, I'll just open.

699
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,060
I'll just kill them first.

700
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,220
Oh my god.

701
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,280
Wait, what the fuck?

702
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,880
Wait, these are...

703
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,220
That's in my fucking thing now?

704
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,160
Okay.

705
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,200
We gotta survive the first run, though.

706
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,460
That's not looking ideal.

707
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:54,740
Alright, there we go.

708
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,400
At least we have health, though.

709
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,240
Oh my god, that's a lot of HP.

710
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,000

714
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:35,580
Okay, it's okay.

715
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,220
It's okay.

716
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,180
My cat's awake.

717
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:38,680
It's okay.

718
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,240
Oh my god, I almost fucked up that.

719
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,240
Again.

720
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,480
Okay, wait, wait.

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,360
Okay, I got it.

727
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:56,340
Alright.

728
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,820
Yeah, it's my first encounter.

729
00:54:57,980 --> 00:54:59,220
I was like, I don't remember this guy.

730
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,240
I never fought him before.

731
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:09,240
Too many hunters failed to tame the massive raging boar but
I did it Swoust had lived and breathed I did it though Death

732
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:18,620
has been able to steal its mighty hooves and tusks I did
that for now yeah see I did though I think she's me The

733
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:26,420
father of all monsters truly Well you need but pay a visit
here and you'll find out Until then um we'll just have to

734
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:33,380
fend him off Alright let's see Oh, it has a chance to hit
two times.

735
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:34,820
Oh, shit.

736
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:35,320
Okay.

737
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:36,620
Oh, my God.

738
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,360
They're both good.

739
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,300
Do we want the supercast?

740
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,720
We want the supercast, right?

741
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,360
That's ideal for our build.

742
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,780
But then extra dose is so good.

743
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,000
Yeah, three is big, too.

744
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:54,630
All right, we'll go with two.

745
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,150
Because we do have the...

746
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,050
We have Cersei.

747
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,710
And then extra money, too.

748
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:01,530
We gotta get that.

749
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:04,070
Oh.

750
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,890
Oh, wait, not this.

751
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:07,910
Okay, I need to...

752
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:08,810
Alright, man, I have two more.

753
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,990
Alright, we have three Poseidons.

754
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,930
Poseidon really wants me to get him.

755
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:18,430
Okay, do we get Hestia or Poseidon, guys?

756
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,170
We have one left.

757
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:29,750
The pathway to the docks is sealed shut by a phantasmal
force that neither mortal nor immortal strength can budge.

758
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,580
Both are good casts.

759
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:37,360
I don't like the fight.

760
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,480
Fire cast.

761
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,720
I am not a fan of the scorch cast.

762
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:42,840
I will say that.

763
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:50,000
Just because, like, um, only because it blends in with the
attacks way too.

764
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,780
Like, if it blends in with the enemy stuff, yeah.

765
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,800
It fucks me up with it.

766
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,280
Because enemy stuff are, like, red, too.

767
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:03,780
Gamba?

768
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,400
Alright.

769
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:08,920
Well, Gamba would the one next to him.

770
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,200
Alright, we'll get Poseidon then.

771
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,540
Like I said, I don't like Hestia's cast.

772
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,760
It's like fucking annoying.

773
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:23,300
I wanted it to try the holding cast.

774
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,260
Normally I don't hold, but I wanted to try it.

775
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,840
Alright, get him!

776
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,260
Oh my god, the birds are here.

777
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,320
Okay, I have no mana now.

778
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,200
Alright.

779
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:41,620

780
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,200

01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:58,420
You said nobody took your eye before, as well as your sheep.

818
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,040
How did you lose...

819
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,560
Nobody played a dirty...

820
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,440
Guys, it's a long-term game.

821
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,040
Foster sailors thought they could get away with my sheep.

822
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,280
So I had to come.

823
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:09,620

Okay, so they don't matter, yeah.

01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,860
And you've sought vengeance on this nobody ever since.

828
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,080
Don't on me personally.

829
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:25,580
Someday somebody's gonna get nobody for what he did.

830
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:27,540
So I am gonna get you.

831
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,580

It really isn't.

907
01:07:55,910 --> 01:07:59,790
Okay, so I lost both my death defiances now.

01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:01,950
I...

922
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:05,150
Guys, I don't even think I'm making it to her.

923
01:09:05,690 --> 01:09:06,390
I...

924
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:09,750
There's a chance I don't even make it.

925
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:13,370
Oh my god.

926
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:17,570

There we go.

930
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:30,650
I don't have a death defiance anymore.

931
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:39,490
Oh my god, I'm getting like the best shit ever, but I'm just

01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,240
Oh my god, I'm stuck in the corner.

936
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,780
I'm stuck in the corner.

937
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:59,200
Oh my god, I went into the fire accident.

938
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:02,420
Okay.

939
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:06,720

Okay, there you go.

941
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,400
Okay, look, I made it here though.

942
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:15,700
I lived.

943
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,980
I don't have a lot of HP, but I lived.

944
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:21,940
Typhon, I mean, of course.

945
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:26,080
After I wondered about his deep connection to the natural
world.

946
01:10:27,380 --> 01:10:28,880
Uh, Scott, thank you for the super chat.

He's a monster, just as you said.

956
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:40,500
Guys, this is just a throwaway round.

957
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:45,380
I'll be warmed up by the next run, guys.

958
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:46,360
A lock-in.

959
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:47,880
A lock-in.

960
01:10:48,540 --> 01:10:50,200
Veritably not you or I, Pop-it.

961
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,140
All that is here belongs is what I say.

962

Surely, surely.

963
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,360
Okay, we should get this one.

964
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,280
I don't know.

965
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,160
Actually, no, we sort of lost all our depth defiances.

966
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,980
Okay, maybe we can save it.

967
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,280
We can save it, guys.

968
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,060
We might be able to save this run.

01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:21,640

Where is he?

983
01:12:56,410 --> 01:13:00,150
I saw huge plumes of fire shooting from the summit of
Olympus recently.

984
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:02,510
Thought the whole mountain was erupting.

985
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,290
But on the closer inspection, it was you.

986
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:06,450
Fighting someone.

987
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:07,350
Oh, it's me!

988
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:08,910
Some deranged eagle chased me off.

989
01:13:10,350 --> 01:13:12,570
That was Prometheus the Titan and his pet.

990
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:16,070
He's turned against the gods and is personally leading the
siege.

991
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:23,930
of olympus i don't know why he's so mad at us you know
what's about forgiveness he got he made great memories with

992
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:30,510
the bird broken free what do mortals have to do with this
whole feud with chronos anyhow i thought all he wanted was

993
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:40,490
his vengeance probably from metheus as well all right are

994
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,430
Oh Oh twenty two.

995
01:13:43,630 --> 01:13:47,810
No, I'm already fucked right now Maybe attack food.

996
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:50,470
Yeah, I'll go with two guys.

997
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:51,250
I'll just go.

998
01:13:51,350 --> 01:13:51,790
I don't know.

999
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:53,670
We're making it far I'm just gonna free.

1000
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:54,350
You know what?

1001
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:59,010
I'm gonna free will this They showed up near our mountain
causing trouble again all because of you they don't know I

1002
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:02,230
practically beg you to come up to our rescue over here Think
heck gave you the order.

1003
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:09,450
We're really in it now All right, oh I know

1004
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,500
I should get nitro boost.

1005
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,300
I'm going to get three.

1006
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,260
I think I need it.

1007
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:24,960
I believe in the dodge.

1008
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,600
I don't believe, though.

1009
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:32,580
I...

1010
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,820
Oh, move speed.

1011
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:34,240
Oh, wait.

1012
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:34,700
Let's do it.

1013
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:35,580
I believe, actually.

1014
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:36,900
Two for the gamma.

1015
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:38,040
Yeah, I started believing.

1016
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,900
Because I was like, oh, move speed is pretty.

1017
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:50,720
good though wait what someone there was like the the i
thought there was a farming thing here i guess i was wrong

1018
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:56,820
all right let's get hestia i swear there's there's been a
very lack of shops right now

1019
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:10,230
oh my god i swear is it me or did the enemies get harder a
lot harder Okay.

1020
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:16,050
I feel like the enemy's got a lot crazier.

1021
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,210
Oh!

1022
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:22,340
All right.

1023
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:23,700
In the name of Hades.

1024
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:26,500
All right, let's see.

1025
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,800
The more I have, I have three.

1026
01:15:29,140 --> 01:15:29,400
Okay.

1027
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:30,500
That's good.

1028
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,140
I have three.

1029
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,980
Oh my gosh, you've done scorched damage.

1030
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh my gosh, you've done scorched on cast.

1031
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:40,560
No, but I'm already fucking up there right now.

1032
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,180
I'm already fucking up.

1033
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,220
I shouldn't risk it.

1034
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:45,320
I'm not feeling...

1035
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,280
Oh, and I don't get HP.

1036
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,600
Okay, that's fine.

1037
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,360
Rehold the stars.

1038
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,060
Ooh.

1039
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,080
Ooh, I like that.

1040
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:03,740
I want a mini-shit.

1041
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:06,540
Oh!

1042
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:17,770
Alright.

1043
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:19,110
I'm gonna do cast.

1044
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:20,930
I'm gonna get Poseidon my cast.

1045
01:16:21,530 --> 01:16:22,350
Alright, here we go.

1046
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:23,110
Let's lose the air.

1047
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:24,310
No, I...

1048
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:29,790
Yeah, no, I think I'm gonna lose here.

1049
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,490
I have zero death defiance, this guy's.

1050
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:36,330
And I'll give you something else for what you did to me last
time.

1051
01:16:37,370 --> 01:16:38,550
Oh, my God.

1052
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:40,410
My first loss here.

1053
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:43,470
I just wasn't locked in.

1054
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,250
I didn't lock in.

1055
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:48,730
Consequences?

1056
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,970
Come on, don't be so gullible.

1057
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:53,230
Anyway, I'm going to open fire now.

1058
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:58,170
Guys, I'm not playing better.

1059
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:01,370
Hang on, reloading.

1060
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:07,330
Oh my god.

1061
01:17:09,010 --> 01:17:10,350
I'm not playing better.

1062
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:13,890
Oh my god.

1063
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,020
Where is she?

1064
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,900
I'm getting so disoriented

1065
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,420
Oh my god Yeah, but I also had that too.

1066
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,480
Oh my god.

1067
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:54,400
Okay, it's fine Okay, it was not fine Okay, this run I'm
locked in now.

1068
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,580
I'm locked in okay.

1069
01:17:55,620 --> 01:17:56,360
We're getting the frog.

1070
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,900
You're right the cow was not in with the with Cersei The cat
was nodded with Circe, you guys.

1071
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:06,080
It was not okay.

1072
01:18:06,100 --> 01:18:10,840
I'm not in a bad way necessarily, and I don't know how I can
smell.

1073
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,540
Six four runs.

1074
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:13,900
That is weird.

1075
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:21,780
Okay, a lot of times I was lying, but this time I was
coping, but this time is real.

1076
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,740
I'm super warmed up.

1077
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:27,760
I sailed across the waters toward Olympus on a ship.

1078
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:30,220
Exciting.

1079
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,560
I was right here the whole time.

1080
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,280
Alright, let's grab this real quick.

1081
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,700
Alright, let's talk to all these people.

1082
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:39,560
Eris upright attacked me.

1083
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,780
Just as I was approaching Mount Olympus.

1084
01:18:42,540 --> 01:18:44,140
Who gave her the adamant rail anyway?

1085
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:47,740
A weapon once used to slay titans turned against the gods.

1086
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,760
The rail has turned against the gods before.

1087
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,820
Only the fates know its true and final purpose.

1088
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,700
But Eris has it by their own decree.

1089
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:00,380
Perhaps it's a plaything to keep her occupied.

1090
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:08,560
to keep me occupied apparently makes me wonder if the fates
weren't chronos stopped or not did you and eras ever fight

1091
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:19,860
like this the thing is the cat's really good oh my god i'm
not talking to her i refuse to talk to her after i lost to

1092
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:20,660
her i

1093
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:33,420
i didn't even see what i upgraded what the fuck did i get I
refuse to give her what she wants.

1094
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:40,740
If I never talked to her, technically I never lost to her.

1095
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:41,680
She can't glow.

1096
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,240
I'm not giving her what she wants.

1097
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:44,720
What did I get?

1098
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,300
I was so mad.

1099
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,720
I didn't even check my upgrades.

1100
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:48,480
Wait, I need P2.

1101
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,160
Give me a sec.

1102
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:42,100
I am back.

1103
01:20:42,160 --> 01:20:43,920
What did I get?

1104
01:20:44,020 --> 01:20:45,360
I actually don't know.

1105
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:47,380
You guys need help.

1106
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,240
I made something that I don't know what I made.

1107
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:58,140
oh boy mary thank you for the super chat thank you thank you

greater gifts of gala okay here you go oh okay each
gathering tool okay enhances the gathering tool Sister

1110
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:20,170
Selene notified me.

1111
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:29,330
It was Eris herself who barred you from gaining the heights
of- Okay, okay, I did not talk to you to fucking get shamed,

1112
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:29,750
okay?

1113
01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:33,530
I- I'm not talking to anyone.

1114
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:39,690
If everyone here is gonna shame me, I shall now not interact
with anyone here.

1115
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:45,610
If you're all gonna be here to shame me, I might as well
just do another run.

1116
01:21:46,590 --> 01:21:47,870
What say the ashes?

1117
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,150
Why do I need shadow?

1118
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:51,490
How do I get shadow?

1119
01:21:53,370 --> 01:21:55,030
Chief, it's real.

1120
01:21:57,390 --> 01:21:58,450
Oh my god, okay.

1121
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:00,330
Now she fucking takes over the cauldron.

1122
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:03,030
Wait, I'll try.

1123
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:06,510
I'll try Cersei one more time, but I think I might need to
get the frog.

1124
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:10,090
I think the frog might have to be it.

1125
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:12,610
Alright, and then we'll grab this for Zeus.

1126
01:22:12,990 --> 01:22:13,550
What was this?

1127
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:16,130
Oh, this is the upgrades for the...

1128
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:16,990
Might as well upgrade it.

1129
01:22:19,610 --> 01:22:29,290
home requisition authorized yeah now grab this too yes

01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:46,970
wait no i got this news i got

1132
01:22:50,710 --> 01:22:53,270
All right, we'll try this again.

1133
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,030
You've seen it now, first hand.

1134
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:57,970
Our great mountain is perpetually besieged.

1135
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,050
And we've not had a moment's peace of late.

1136
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,850
Yet this trial only makes us stronger as that.

1137
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,810
If I fuck up Cersei again, I'm going back to Momus.

1138
01:23:06,830 --> 01:23:08,310
Okay, but this time I'm locking in.

1139
01:23:08,370 --> 01:23:09,170
Oh, hey, there we go.

1140
01:23:10,590 --> 01:23:12,430
Okay, we got the cast for it, too.

1141
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:13,830
That's what we wanted.

1142
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:17,170
We got the Thunderbolt cast, too.

1143
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:21,520
Yeah.

1144
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,820
Oh no, now I have to fish for myself.

1145
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:28,600
Oh, yeah!

1146
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,840
I forgot to rarefight.

1147
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,600
It's okay.

1148
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,900
Maybe I'll have the strong cast, you know?

1149
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:49,380
All right.

1150
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,520
We did it, Frenos.

1151
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:52,040
What would Demeter be good for?

1152
01:23:53,700 --> 01:24:00,100
If Kronos truly is behind the reawakening of Typhon, Then he
is not merely arrogant, but mad.

1153
01:24:00,720 --> 01:24:04,460
He promises another golden age, yet visits such a creature
on this world.

1154
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,480
I know, right?

1155
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:08,880
Can't believe it.

1156
01:24:08,940 --> 01:24:09,660
He would mix...

1157
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:10,060
Oh, wait.

1158
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,300
He would mix gods and creatures.

1159
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:17,380
One special, or...

1160
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:19,300
Or attack.

1161
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,100
One or two, chat.

1162
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:22,360
Two?

1163
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,020
Two.

1164
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:27,740

Oh, I don't have gifts anyway, so never mind.

1178
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:06,180
doing everywhere lady media they control the barrier before
the docks that much is clear perhaps the titans legions use

1179
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:14,440
them to coordinate attacks they are the product of a very
sick mind imprisoning so many shades in the tiniest

1180
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:22,280
enclosures wherein all their psyche may be drained can you
imagine sorceress that's terrible i hadn't realized the

Yeah, I'm gonna definitely get the second Zeus later.

1202
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,400
I regret our meetings are in haste and that we are unable to
converse when thus we meet.

1203
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:21,020
I am expected high aloft for all to see.

1204
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,540
Our connection is to remain as hidden as the crossroads.

1205
01:27:25,260 --> 01:27:26,860
We are to move in shadows.

1206
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:28,080
Aw.

1207
01:27:28,700 --> 01:27:29,160

Where's my Gamba?

1225
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,680
Excuse me, but why is he very alive?

1226
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,700

everyone.

Okay, I pressed dash there

1334
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:33,600
First guy

1335
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:54,430
Oh my god, okay, I hope that hits him Oh shit Oh my god, I
almost like hit myself too I swear these are new Have I not

1336
01:36:54,430 --> 01:36:55,850
been paying attention?

1337
01:36:59,070 --> 01:36:59,590
Okay.

1338
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,840
Okay, that's fine.

1339
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:08,760
Oh my god, please, my minion.

1340
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,020
Anytime now.

1341
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:14,780
All right, here we go.

1342
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:16,860
That will show him.

1343
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:23,020
Yeah, we did it.

1344
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:25,040
Okay, see, we're doing better now, guys.

1345
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,980
See, I'm locking it in little by little, chat.

1346
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:29,040
Look at that.

1347
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:31,200
I did it.

1348
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:33,800
I didn't lose the depth of finds this time.

1349
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:36,360
Slowly but surely.

1350
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:39,740
The conditions under which they graze about and wander.

1351
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,700
Not exactly lost.

1352
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:43,720
At least not yet.

1353
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,320
The one they have to guide them.

1354
01:37:46,340 --> 01:37:47,400
That is, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

1355
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:52,240
I'm getting better from last stream's runs, guys.

1356
01:37:55,220 --> 01:37:57,600
That's what I mean, obviously.

1357
01:37:58,820 --> 01:37:59,140
Yeah.

1358
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:05,760
I still have the rarefied thing.

1359
01:38:07,140 --> 01:38:09,180
Oh, I forgot to use the rarefied.

1360
01:38:17,770 --> 01:38:19,880
All right, up we go.

1361
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:27,560
Jesus Christ.

1362
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,520
Okay, that's fine.

1363
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:32,600
I just didn't know where he came from.

1364
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:35,560
I might as well get magic.

1365
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:48,720
Okay, buddy.

1366
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:51,900
All right, it's fine.

1367
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:55,640
It's okay.

1368
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:57,440
I still live.

1369
01:38:58,120 --> 01:38:58,240
Oh.

1370
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,440
What is it?

1371
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:03,960
Oh, some cannon buzz.

1372
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:05,020
Yoink.

1373
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:06,180
Bye, cannon buzz.

1374
01:39:08,780 --> 01:39:09,840
Everything's okay.

1375
01:39:10,320 --> 01:39:11,400
Everything is okay.

1376
01:39:11,540 --> 01:39:11,740
Oh, okay.

1377
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,460
Shit, Gambo worked out!

1378
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:14,580
Yeah!

1379
01:39:14,940 --> 01:39:15,480
Let's go!

1380
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:17,920
The Gambo worked out.

1381
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:19,580
There you go.

1382
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:21,940
Yeah.

1383
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:25,520
Holy fuck, I did not expect him to run at me there.

1384
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:34,900
Oh my god.

1385
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:36,580
I got a little worried.

1386
01:39:38,980 --> 01:39:39,040
Nice.

1387
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:40,380
Oh, it didn't matter.

1388
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:43,020
Moon or Hermes, chat.

1389
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:44,020
Which is better?

1390
01:39:49,190 --> 01:39:50,550
Moon or Hermes?

1391
01:39:51,870 --> 01:39:53,110
Oh, goodbye.

1392
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:01,280
I see more Hermes than Moon.

1393
01:40:01,420 --> 01:40:02,800
Okay, I'll do Hermes then.

1394
01:40:05,420 --> 01:40:09,600
I saw more Hermes, so I'm gonna go for that then.

1395
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:12,000
I'll make it closer.

1396
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:19,640
It'll be a shame if, you know, something happens to me.

1397
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:22,960
I'm not leaving this area, that's for sure.

1398
01:40:26,340 --> 01:40:27,140
There you go.

1399
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:29,180
There's literally a fire pit there.

1400
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,100
I'm not crossing that bridge.

1401
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:32,120
Oh.

1402
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:37,480
And your cast expires.

1403
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:39,760
Okay, I feel like we need our cast more, though.

1404
01:40:40,700 --> 01:40:41,740
I guess quick bug?

1405
01:40:43,860 --> 01:40:44,320
Yeah.

1406
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:45,800
Oh, hey.

1407
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,700
Are you really...

1408
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:47,780
Are you fucking kidding me?

1409
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:48,800
You do it for this guy?

1410
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:49,600
Okay, that's fine.

1411
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:51,600
That's okay.

1412
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:54,000
That's okay.

1413
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:54,480
Echo.

1414
01:40:55,980 --> 01:40:57,160
I didn't want you to do it for this.

1415
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,120
Oh, no.

1416
01:40:58,140 --> 01:40:59,500
I'm so bad for these.

1417
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:01,820
I'm actually so bad against the snow.

1418
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,220
Oh, wait.

1419
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:03,520
Unless I'll just freeze him, I guess.

1420
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,200
Oh, shit.

1421
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:06,660
It doesn't matter.

1422
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:08,880
I forgot he fucking turns.

1423
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:10,820
Oh, my God.

1424
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:11,180
I hate.

1425
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:13,640
I actually hate this boss a lot.

1426
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,300
Like, he fucks with me a lot.

1427
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:22,200
Because of the thing turning.

1428
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,100
It, like, messes me up.

1429
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:27,520
Yeah, that's fine.

1430
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:29,860
Oh my god.

1431
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:31,280
Oh my god, really?

1432
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,160
Yeah, I froze him, though.

1433
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:43,490
Okay, that's fine.

1434
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:46,550
Whoa!

1435
01:41:49,270 --> 01:41:49,850
That's fine.

1436
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:51,610
He's almost...

1437
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:52,630
Okay, okay, nice.

1438
01:41:53,210 --> 01:41:53,950
I broke him.

1439
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:54,830
Break time!

1440
01:41:55,690 --> 01:41:56,070
Break!

1441
01:41:57,450 --> 01:41:58,630
The sea claims another.

1442
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:08,090
go see all those chronos ships trudging this way would you

I'll grab this guy over here.

1452
01:43:07,610 --> 01:43:08,290
Okay, I froze him.

1453
01:43:08,370 --> 01:43:08,750
That's good.

1454
01:43:11,370 --> 01:43:12,790
Okay, I froze him and tapped.

1455
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:13,250
Nice.

1456
01:43:14,150 --> 01:43:15,570
Oh, thank God I actually needed that.

1457
01:43:16,650 --> 01:43:17,030
Yay!

1458
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:21,070
Nice.

1459
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:27,260
Oh!

1460
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:28,280
It's fine.

1461
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:29,760
Everything is safe.

1462
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:30,900
I feel so safe.

1463
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:34,020
I feel so safe.

1464
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:36,080
Oops.

1465
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,000
I messed that up a little bit.

1466
01:43:40,780 --> 01:43:41,940
I actually have a minion now.

1467
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,480
Oh my god, he's actually helpful.

1468
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,020
Oh, and more hearts.

1469
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:50,880
I mean, health is health.

1470
01:43:52,780 --> 01:43:53,560
I'll take it.

All right, join my army.

1475
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:33,340
See you in the crossroads.

1476
01:44:34,040 --> 01:44:38,500
How shameful that we now resort to common subterfuge.

1477
01:44:39,240 --> 01:44:44,200
Having our correspondence smuggled to and fro by the
erstwhile boatmen of the dead.

1478
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:46,820
All right.

1479
01:44:48,120 --> 01:44:48,680
Oh.

1480
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:49,640
Mm-mm.

1481
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:51,240
Oh, okay.

1482
01:44:52,220 --> 01:44:54,240
Maybe it also creates a gust.

1483
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,360
That should be good.

1484
01:44:56,140 --> 01:44:56,640
Yeah.

1485
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:57,980
Yeah.

1486
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:58,780
Three?

1487
01:44:59,680 --> 01:45:00,380
Where am I cast?

1488
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:01,720
Yeah, okay.

1489
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:05,360
I was thinking, since mine is a cast build.

1490
01:45:06,680 --> 01:45:06,920
Okay.

1491
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:08,880
We're almost there.

1492
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:11,640
We're almost there.

1493
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:12,260
Oh, God.

1494
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:16,880
I always have to, like, be aware of the fucking these guys
dashing in randomly.

1495
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,140
It's so random whenever it happens.

1496
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:22,800
Oh, my God.

1497
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:24,600
Like, right now, I didn't expect them there.

1498
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:26,680
It's okay.

1499
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:27,660
He's burning himself.

1500
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,120
Why are you burning yourself?

1501
01:45:32,700 --> 01:45:33,340
Uh...

1502
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:34,240
Grab ash.

1503
01:45:34,740 --> 01:45:35,520
Ash is always good.

1504
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,140
Jesus Christ, I can't see anything.

1505
01:45:40,980 --> 01:45:46,840
I hope everything is okay, because I don't know what the
fuck is going on.

1506
01:45:49,320 --> 01:45:49,800
A gift.

1507
01:45:50,200 --> 01:45:50,520
Yay!

1508
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:51,960
Oh, another shot.

1509
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:52,800
Let's go!

1510
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,960
I did transform.

1511
01:45:57,520 --> 01:46:01,760
You just couldn't see him because the because everything is
so fucking hard to see

1512
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:08,320

01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:19,140
It is?

1689
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:19,540
Okay.

1690
01:57:20,020 --> 01:57:20,940
Gambo time.

1691
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:23,900
Gamba time.

1692
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:25,780
Oh, hey.

1693
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:26,660
Mining.

1694
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:27,860
Mining.

1695
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:31,640
Oh.

1696
01:57:32,660 --> 01:57:34,060
It's a bit risky, yeah.

1697
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:34,840
That's why I'm scared.

1698
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:47,020
of the course and outcome of all lives all preordained
that's the sense of oh nice oh no it's normal game soon i

1699
01:57:47,020 --> 01:57:54,200
think the fate's determined much about our lives when and
where we are born for instance and to whom but i don't think

1700
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:02,460
they set every detail and i know they're not leaving at all
right now because chronos has them all right for the most

1701
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:07,000
part i concur with your assessment I am the reason Kronos
has them now.

1702
01:58:07,460 --> 01:58:10,480
You asked me where to find them, and I decided to tell them.

1703
01:58:11,140 --> 01:58:14,340
To verify such choices could be made without their
influence.

1704
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:17,160
Now do you understand my quandary?

1705
01:58:18,160 --> 01:58:18,420
Respond.

1706
01:58:18,640 --> 01:58:19,620
Please respond.

1707
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,840
Oh, no.

1708
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:24,160
Oh, no.

1709
01:58:24,160 --> 01:58:25,540
Almighty Chaos, you were deceived.

1710
01:58:26,220 --> 01:58:28,300
Kronos wished to find the fates for his own gain.

1711
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:32,240
They were one of the only forces in this world powerful
enough to stop him.

1712
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,140
They are not so powerful as they appeared.

1713
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:39,960
Nevertheless, I think you are correct.

1714
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:42,920
Foros indicated his intentions were benign.

1715
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:44,060
I am unfamiliar.

1716
01:58:44,180 --> 01:58:44,700
No!

1717
01:58:47,160 --> 01:58:51,460
Chaos, how could you get baited so easily?

1718
01:58:54,520 --> 01:58:56,060
Team Journey, Forest Health.

1719
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:58,840
Oh, that's so bad for late game.

1720

Yeah, both of the guys, I mean, it's one or the other.

02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:35,420

Yeah, both is probably the smart choice.

1737
02:01:48,540 --> 02:01:48,580
Okay.

1738
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:56,840
I'm just gonna make sure I don't die to that.

1739
02:01:58,700 --> 02:01:59,680
Oh my god.

1740
02:01:59,800 --> 02:02:01,440

Okay, that's an accident.

02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,580
Alright.

02:02:15,020 --> 02:02:16,320
I hate the fire so much.

1747
02:02:17,620 --> 02:02:18,600
Oh my god.

1748
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:20,620
Are you fucking kidding me?

1749
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:25,470
Okay.

02:02:37,950 --> 02:02:38,390
Okay, it's okay.

1753
02:02:41,890 --> 02:02:43,190
It is not okay.

1754
02:02:50,470 --> 02:02:51,230
Please, Froggy!

1755
02:02:54,050 --> 02:02:54,310

Wait.

1776
02:03:25,930 --> 02:03:29,370
Whenever you take damage, shrug some of it off.

1777
02:03:29,850 --> 02:03:30,270
Oh my god.

1778
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:30,590

In the safe corner.

Alright, here we go.

1791
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:31,280
Your specialty is your cast.

1792
02:04:31,420 --> 02:04:31,980
Cost learning.

1793
02:04:32,260 --> 02:04:33,460
Alright, one, two, or three, chat.

02:04:36,620 --> 02:04:38,240
Yeah, I kill sealed at the end.

1795
02:04:38,260 --> 02:04:39,880
Like a real gamer.

1796
02:04:41,960 --> 02:04:42,760
One?

1797
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:44,200
Alright.

1798
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:47,000
What's this?

1799
02:04:47,280 --> 02:04:47,600
Burn?

1800
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:50,220
Wait.

1801
02:04:50,540 --> 02:04:51,280
Slayer foe?

1802
02:04:51,580 --> 02:04:52,020
Oh, okay.

1803
02:04:53,320 --> 02:04:53,500
Oh.

1804
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:58,300
That's easy.

1805
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,060
It's okay.

1806
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:04,460
I have this.

1807
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:09,620
It's fine.

1808
02:05:10,280 --> 02:05:10,480
Oh, wait.

1809
02:05:10,500 --> 02:05:11,360
It's just here.

1810
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:11,900
Yay!

1811
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:13,300
Easy.

1812
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:14,480
Monument cleansed.

1813
02:05:15,180 --> 02:05:16,260
We got free moon.

1814
02:05:17,480 --> 02:05:21,020
We gotta get all the way to here.

1815
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:22,320
Wait, actually.

1816
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:29,060
Okay, we're gonna get over here.

1817
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,520
One, two, three.

1818
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:32,220
We're getting to that other side.

1819
02:05:34,460 --> 02:05:34,940
Uh.

1820
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:37,000
Alright, chat.

1821
02:05:37,600 --> 02:05:39,660
Palm or Poseidon?

1822
02:05:41,420 --> 02:05:42,700
Yeah, the summon carry there.

1823
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:47,920
Poseidon?

1824
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:50,520
Alright, Poseidon time.

1825
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:55,620
I'll grab some flowers while they fight.

1826
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:00,520
What?

1827
02:06:00,760 --> 02:06:00,920
What?

1828
02:06:01,260 --> 02:06:02,720
Okay, I did not see the gust.

1829
02:06:03,200 --> 02:06:03,980
Oh my god.

1830
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:07,120
It's always like something screen clutter.

1831
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:12,780
I think that's like my only biggest gripe is that sometimes
there's just... The screen clutter is just too much

1832
02:06:12,780 --> 02:06:13,380
sometimes.

1833
02:06:14,240 --> 02:06:15,880
I'm just so bad with it.

1834
02:06:20,500 --> 02:06:21,900
Hit us, but...

1835
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:23,980
Oh my god, I can't...

1836
02:06:25,640 --> 02:06:27,260
I keep forgetting to not dash.

1837
02:06:29,560 --> 02:06:30,800
He's messing me up.

1838
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,860
He's like, Toki, stop dashing!

1839
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:35,180
Buzz feels so nice!

1840
02:06:38,240 --> 02:06:41,860
If dashing is bad, why does it feel so good?

1841
02:06:45,140 --> 02:06:47,220
The boon from Chaos just took hold.

1842
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:47,700
Nice.

1843
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,680
Olympus, I accept this message.

1844
02:06:53,560 --> 02:06:58,180
Uh, his surrounding foes as a Star Trek, but you prime 30.

1845
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,760
Yeah, I could dash now!

1846
02:07:03,080 --> 02:07:04,080
Puba after.

1847
02:07:08,040 --> 02:07:09,240
Really, really sore.

1848
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:10,540
One or three?

1849
02:07:11,860 --> 02:07:12,420
Blood gain?

1850
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,280
Alright, we'll do one.

1851
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:17,440
The ocean's fury.

02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:21,920

Whoa!

1860
02:08:03,280 --> 02:08:04,560
I always use magic.

1861
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:06,540
Wait.

1862

Hold cast aim.

02:08:08,760 --> 02:08:10,580
Oh, but I can aim my cast.

1866
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:11,580
Oh, fuck.

1867
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:12,320
They're all good.

1868
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:16,060
Wait, they're all really good, chat.

1869
02:08:20,060 --> 02:08:21,700
Which is better for long term.

1870
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:22,520
One or two.

1871
02:08:25,600 --> 02:08:26,060
Two?

1872
02:08:30,370 --> 02:08:31,090
Two, okay.

1873
02:08:31,530 --> 02:08:32,530
Okay, I can get another one.

1874
02:08:32,630 --> 02:08:33,430
Oh my god, it's the meter.

1875
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:36,790
Okay.

1876
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:41,130
Oh, that's just late in the game.

1877
02:08:41,370 --> 02:08:42,350
That sucks.

1878
02:08:49,350 --> 02:08:49,810
Yeah.

1879
02:08:53,590 --> 02:08:53,990
Three.

1880
02:08:54,430 --> 02:08:55,910
Oh, everyone's conflicted.

1881
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:04,500
I've been hoping.

1882
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:05,140
hold Q.

1883
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:06,880
I don't hold it as often.

1884
02:09:10,340 --> 02:09:11,060
Also don't...

1885
02:09:11,060 --> 02:09:13,940
Oh my god, he's like knocking my, trying to knock my door
down.

1886
02:09:15,260 --> 02:09:18,020
Wait, I didn't even... Okay, give me a sec.

1887
02:09:18,240 --> 02:09:19,160
Let's check what he wants.

1888
02:10:42,210 --> 02:10:43,010
Sorry, I'm back.

1889
02:10:43,090 --> 02:10:44,310
He wanted...

1890
02:10:44,310 --> 02:10:45,810
Did you guys agree on something?

1891
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:48,270
Did the hive... Oh yeah, by the way, I watched Pluribus.

1892
02:10:48,490 --> 02:10:50,050
I watched the first two episodes of Pluribus.

1893
02:10:50,450 --> 02:10:51,790
Why can't you guys be like them?

1894
02:10:52,010 --> 02:10:52,770
The hive mind.

1895
02:10:56,350 --> 02:11:07,990
all i'm all i'm saying guys why can't you guys have a have
my like these those people in florida their council agreed

1896
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:19,850
on two it's a good show i like it so far i hate them in
character but it's a good show oh he just wanted attention

1897
02:11:19,850 --> 02:11:26,430
he was like give me food he literally baited me outside and
like looked at the kitchen and was like looking the the

1898
02:11:26,430 --> 02:11:36,750
treat bones and i'm like no you had you had like one you
only have one a day because she's like supposed to be a

1899
02:11:36,750 --> 02:11:44,630
karen and like the whole she has like anger issues so
pleuribus is basically like what if the world became a hive

1900
02:11:44,630 --> 02:11:50,230
mind so everyone keeps talking about the show because it's
from the creators of breaking bad and better call salt and

1901
02:11:50,230 --> 02:11:57,150
it's literally filmed around the same location too and the
whole premise is like what if the world became a hive mind

1902
02:11:57,150 --> 02:12:02,890
like got infected by a virus that made everyone join their
minds together and became a hive mind not everyone survives

1903
02:12:02,890 --> 02:12:09,670
the integration into it because it's like a virus um and
obviously it has to do with your fucking mind and then so

1904
02:12:09,670 --> 02:12:18,070
and there's only like 13 people who are immune to the virus
and um everyone keeps talking about it on my twitter feed

1905
02:12:18,070 --> 02:12:26,310
because they're like oh it's created by the the it's created
by the people created Breaking Bad so I checked so the the

1906
02:12:26,310 --> 02:12:33,070
main character she has anger problems and i assume that like
whenever she gets angry at the hive mind like the people in

1907
02:12:33,070 --> 02:12:39,310
the hive mind they start having seizures and like people
start dying because like i like this is my theory and i

1908
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:44,890
think it's because like um the people just don't like it
when like you know because it's a hive mind it's everyone's

1909
02:12:44,890 --> 02:12:51,290
thoughts and everyone's thoughts are integrated together so
like obviously like some of the people might not like

1910
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:56,390
getting mad at you know like might not like people getting
angry at them for us and then they like freak out and

1911
02:12:56,390 --> 02:13:00,230
something that's why they're in seizure because like
everyone's like fighting each other in the hive mind being

1912
02:13:00,230 --> 02:13:06,550
like i don't like it when someone's mad at me it makes me
really depressed like or like it makes me really bad too and

1913
02:13:06,550 --> 02:13:11,750
then the hive mind inside has like their own inner conflict
because of that so where every time the main character gets

1914
02:13:11,750 --> 02:13:19,690
angry at them millions of people die so um so like but then
she keeps doing it yeah she's like oh my And then she like,

1915
02:13:19,870 --> 02:13:21,690
when she first did it, she threw it out, throws it out.

1916
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:24,550
Because she's like, oh my God, I just killed 11 million
people.

1917
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:28,790
But then she knows, she knows every time she gets angry,
people die.

1918
02:13:29,130 --> 02:13:30,490
But she keeps doing it.

1919
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:36,210
Like, I watched two episodes and she did it three fucking
times in two episodes.

1920
02:13:36,610 --> 02:13:39,010
And I'm like, stop getting angry at them.

1921
02:13:39,050 --> 02:13:41,550
You know, you feel shit when people die.

1922
02:13:42,110 --> 02:13:49,130
Like, I'm like, bro, you always feel fucking shit when it
happens.

1923
02:13:49,150 --> 02:13:58,210
but yet you still get rage baited like yeah because everyone
around the world is doing something like maybe they're

1924
02:13:58,210 --> 02:14:04,650
driving a car like on a plane but then they get into a
fucking seizure for like a couple like for like a minute or

1925
02:14:04,650 --> 02:14:13,290
something and then like literally like she come she like
triggers a seizure and then like less than like a couple of

1926
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:20,610
hours later she gets angry again but she's like I can't
believe I'm so sad I killed a lot of people and then she

1927
02:14:20,610 --> 02:14:36,910
gets rage baited again and it's like a cycle so i it's like
a fucking cycle anyway what are we getting guys one two or

1928
02:14:36,910 --> 02:14:47,950
three are we doing the lightning bolts two i heard it does
get like the show does not does get worse as the episode

1929
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:52,930
goes on because like the first episode's the best episode
and then like after that these people are saying like it's

1930
02:14:52,930 --> 02:15:01,130
not as good as oh my god it's eagle time um it it doesn't
get better which sucks because like i i it was pretty i

1931
02:15:01,130 --> 02:15:14,910
thought it was really interesting so far it's memory game
time because the premise is super interesting despite the

1932
02:15:14,910 --> 02:15:23,910
plunders that you made it now it's been great so far i guess
it's like it's a slow burn people are saying like it's a

1933
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:32,650
very slow burn i realize this must be complicated for you as
someone whose loyalties are mostly to an eagle but i am not

1934
02:15:32,650 --> 02:15:37,410
about to let that thing destroy everything my family i like
the story i like the story i just don't like the main

1935
02:15:37,410 --> 02:15:43,270
character i mean it's also like another thing about the
thing is that the rest of the survivors are like taking

1936
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:51,230
advantage of it be like what if it's like i want to fly to
this country with the uh with the uh the president's plane

1937
02:15:51,230 --> 02:15:54,270
and shit like that I want eight women to accompany me.

1938
02:15:54,290 --> 02:15:56,230
Like, you know, they're taking advantage of like, ah, no,
it's cool.

1939
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:57,950
You know, I get to do anything I want.

1940
02:15:58,550 --> 02:16:02,290
Because the hive mind will always will cater to the immune
people.

1941
02:16:02,570 --> 02:16:05,010
So literally it's like you have, you can do whatever the
fuck you want.

1942
02:16:05,310 --> 02:16:11,410
So they're like, so Carol, the main character, is like the
only one that feels like, am I the only one that just wants

1943
02:16:11,410 --> 02:16:14,870
to fix the world and like make everyone back to normal
again?

1944
02:16:14,930 --> 02:16:16,790
And the other survivors are like, yeah.

1945
02:16:17,730 --> 02:16:19,170
Like, we like it like this.

1946
02:16:19,610 --> 02:16:23,990
Like, so like, He's like, I'm fucking going crazy.

1947
02:16:24,190 --> 02:16:27,510
I'm the only one that wants to fucking save the human race.

1948
02:16:28,870 --> 02:16:29,310
Yeah.

1949
02:16:29,870 --> 02:16:32,230
So sex with everyone's mind connected.

1950
02:16:32,490 --> 02:16:33,170
That's true.

1951
02:16:33,430 --> 02:16:33,610
Yeah.

1952
02:16:33,610 --> 02:16:38,050
So the problem was that one of the immune people was like,
um, this is my son.

1953
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:40,010
Like her, the son got connected to the hive mind.

1954
02:16:40,310 --> 02:16:43,070
And she's like, yeah, but like, I have everything I want.

1955
02:16:43,170 --> 02:16:44,470
See, I still have my son.

1956
02:16:44,830 --> 02:16:47,430
And then Carol, the main character was like, that's not your
son.

1957
02:16:47,510 --> 02:16:48,590
Not just your son.

1958
02:16:49,010 --> 02:16:50,350
That's your ex-boyfriend.

1959
02:16:50,850 --> 02:16:52,050
That's your chiropractor.

1960
02:16:52,050 --> 02:16:53,530
That's your gynecologist.

1961
02:16:53,830 --> 02:16:56,650
That's everybody in your son's body.

1962
02:16:57,050 --> 02:16:58,750
Like, how are you okay with that?

1963
02:16:58,930 --> 02:17:00,610
And she's like, no, it's my son.

1964
02:17:00,830 --> 02:17:01,970
He's nine.

1965
02:17:06,630 --> 02:17:11,290
So, like, everyone you interact with is, like, all connected
together.

1966
02:17:13,170 --> 02:17:15,010
Oh, we're talking about Pluribus.

1967
02:17:15,830 --> 02:17:17,250
Like, she made a good point.

1968
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:18,590
He's like, that's not your son.

1969
02:17:18,890 --> 02:17:22,030
That's literally everyone you've ever interacted with.

1970
02:17:22,050 --> 02:17:36,830
in that boy's body like that son knows what your sex life is
like because it's everyone in that body your husband is in

1971
02:17:36,830 --> 02:17:53,310
your son yeah that's why she's like why the fuck do you want
to keep it like this he's yeah he's our son Like that makes

1972
02:17:53,310 --> 02:17:53,770
sense.

1973
02:17:53,910 --> 02:17:55,890
So I was like, why the fuck are you guys okay?

1974
02:17:55,990 --> 02:18:02,530
I mean to be fair Also, the good side is that you could do
whatever fuck you want as long as you're immune You could do

1975
02:18:02,530 --> 02:18:07,250
whatever to fuck you want you can request for anything you
want also You want to choose your loyalties with greater

1976
02:18:07,250 --> 02:18:10,250
care not let them be decided by birthright

1977
02:18:13,830 --> 02:18:20,450
She just toast me the main character just toast me a bit
Like I understand it's like realistic, you know the way

1978
02:18:20,450 --> 02:18:24,710
she's acting but still Holy fuck!

1979
02:18:25,430 --> 02:18:26,910
What the fuck?

1980
02:18:28,610 --> 02:18:30,270
I forgot what it was like to fight him.

1981
02:18:30,470 --> 02:18:30,750
I'm sorry.

1982
02:18:31,170 --> 02:18:32,090
It's been so long.

1983
02:18:33,030 --> 02:18:35,490
I actually forgot what it was like to fight this guy.

1984
02:18:37,970 --> 02:18:40,210

02:18:55,700 --> 02:18:56,540
Okay, that's fine.

1988
02:18:59,580 --> 02:19:00,400

02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:27,740

I did not trust myself.

2019
02:20:34,250 --> 02:20:35,750
Are you fucking kidding?

We don't, we left him to die.

2197
02:37:39,540 --> 02:37:40,040
Okay, never mind.

2198
02:37:40,160 --> 02:37:41,460
We never came back for him.

2199
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,180
Oh my god.

2200
02:37:43,780 --> 02:37:45,640
I can't believe that was the run.

2201
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,520
Jesus Christ.

2202
02:37:47,780 --> 02:37:49,800
That one was a scary one.

02:37:51,440 --> 02:37:51,940
Oh my god.

2204
02:37:52,040 --> 02:37:55,120

Oh my god.

Everyone loves to be naked for some reason.

2218
02:39:14,780 --> 02:39:17,320
I mean, if you have the body, you gotta show it off, I
guess.

2219
02:39:18,020 --> 02:39:23,360
I don't know.

But the truth is, I had an inkling of doubt, especially once
I saw Typhon for myself.

2238
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:18,360
He was quite large.

The minion never came back to tell his story, so I took
credit.

2320
02:47:57,340 --> 02:48:02,460
Well, I mean, if the minion is dead, no one else can know
the truth.

2321
02:48:05,180 --> 02:48:07,140
The truth dies with me.

Yeah, what minion?

2323
02:48:10,020 --> 02:48:12,300

Yeah, we don't need to do any of that.

2357
02:50:27,830 --> 02:50:33,490

I was like, do I keep the frog?

2370
02:52:12,080 --> 02:52:13,560
I was thinking about it.

2371
02:52:15,340 --> 02:52:15,820
All right.

2372
02:52:16,460 --> 02:52:17,420

2374
02:52:19,800 --> 02:52:21,060

Oh, hey, guys.

2379
02:52:31,290 --> 02:52:39,290
Fleeting is the sense of hope or joy within the Crossroads

2380
02:52:39,290 --> 02:52:46,130
small tavern of air No time to unwind Um, where is my free

Wait, excuse me.

2383
02:52:55,530 --> 02:52:59,150
What's the point of spending money if I don't get anything
in return?

2384
02:52:59,610 --> 02:53:03,630

Okay, Hera.

2392

Okay, we'll do Hera.

2393
02:53:51,820 --> 02:53:52,580
The goddess.

2394
02:53:52,860 --> 02:53:54,080
Sorry, I forgot about her.

2395
02:53:55,020 --> 02:53:56,240
Alright, we'll do Hera then.

2396
02:53:56,420 --> 02:53:57,740
What would be good to build?

2397
02:53:57,860 --> 02:53:59,340
I guess, like, charge moves.

2398
02:53:59,580 --> 02:54:00,360
More to be done up here.

2399
02:54:02,080 --> 02:54:03,680
Alright, Hera getting teased.

2400
02:54:05,940 --> 02:54:06,420
Yay!

02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:07,460
Yay!

2402
02:54:09,380 --> 02:54:12,360
Pleased to have finally met in a more proper way, my dear.

2403
02:54:12,880 --> 02:54:18,040
You bought this mountain of ours a bit of extra time, so we
are bolstering our defenses as best we can.

2404
02:54:18,740 --> 02:54:19,940
Thus, I'm beseeching you.

2405
02:54:19,980 --> 02:54:21,740
I always forget Zeus's way.

2406
02:54:22,300 --> 02:54:23,380
I think everyone does.

2407
02:54:28,620 --> 02:54:30,640
That's why Medusa got turned.

2408
02:54:38,040 --> 02:54:52,660
cast and flicks hitch and immediately deals damage based on
food even Zeus yeah even Zeus forgets his wife yeah even

2409
02:54:52,660 --> 02:55:06,540
Zeus forgets we want to which one or should we keep it just
take anything yeah but which one do we take All right I'll

2410
02:55:06,540 --> 02:55:07,320
try rush

2411
02:55:11,750 --> 02:55:17,950
I didn't remember did oh whoa that was fast chaos right off
the bat

2412
02:55:22,900 --> 02:55:33,380
Them some flux Yeah, we got early chaos presents a
significant problem for the Olympians and now also for you I

2413
02:55:33,380 --> 02:55:41,340
am not necessarily expected he and Kronos to join forces
Perhaps this is why I could not Detect Typhon's reawakening.

2414
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:47,900
Your 33, your attack's still 42.

2415
02:55:49,100 --> 02:55:50,920
Oh my god, I don't know.

02:55:52,760 --> 02:55:53,880

2417
02:55:56,660 --> 02:55:56,980
Two?

2418
02:55:57,180 --> 02:55:59,420
Do you guys think I can do it in two though?

2419
02:55:59,780 --> 02:55:59,980
Yeah.

But I will try.

2422
02:56:05,300 --> 02:56:06,400
Let's see how this goes.

2423
02:56:06,920 --> 02:56:09,040
The ancient and obscure originator.

2424
02:56:09,060 --> 02:56:18,000
of creation yet remains observing from within such black and
penetrable depths the endless toil of the living and the

2425
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:24,840
dead okay this is witness to all i'm like scared does it
start counting when i go into the room or when the encounter

2426
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:33,540
starts square guys does it count when i'm in the room guys
uh does it count when i'm here in just exploring or when i'm

2427
02:56:33,540 --> 02:56:34,800
in a room with enemies

That's fine.

2433
02:57:26,340 --> 02:57:26,860
That's a risk.

2434
02:57:27,080 --> 02:57:28,920
It's better than losing 500

2435
02:57:32,080 --> 02:57:42,320
It's better than losing 500 It's better than losing 500 Your

Okay, that's fine.

2443
02:58:20,040 --> 02:58:20,940
Guys, I don't know what I'm doing.

02:58:20,960 --> 02:58:22,400
I'm gonna make it.

2445
02:58:25,800 --> 02:58:28,480
I'm very worried, guys.

2446
02:58:32,860 --> 02:58:36,780
I'm not feeling so good about this challenge.

2447
02:58:37,640 --> 02:58:39,360

02:58:55,110 --> 02:58:55,830
I felt that.

2454
02:58:56,450 --> 02:58:58,430
Oh wait, but there's this.

2455
02:59:01,980 --> 02:59:02,360
It's fine.

2456
02:59:04,580 --> 02:59:05,920
Wait, does this count as an encounter?

2457
02:59:09,100 --> 02:59:11,080
Oh, I don't know if that counts as an encounter.

2458
02:59:17,450 --> 02:59:20,270
Okay, go, go, speed, speed, speed, HP, HP!

Oh, the timer is paused.

2463
02:59:53,750 --> 02:59:55,450
My chaos curse subsided.

2464
02:59:55,810 --> 02:59:58,070
We've bigger problems on Olympus than we counted on.

2465
02:59:58,270 --> 02:59:59,590
Oh, she paused the counter.

2466
02:59:59,750 --> 02:59:59,930
Okay.

Oh, we got saved.

03:01:21,640 --> 03:01:22,860
That was very rough for me.

2491
03:01:23,680 --> 03:01:24,720
I got very scared.

2492
03:01:25,620 --> 03:01:26,440
Oh, nice.

2493
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:28,460

Okay, there is hammer right here.

2495
03:01:33,040 --> 03:01:33,060

Oh!

2505

Wait, that's good because I'm always charging it.

2506
03:02:12,710 --> 03:02:14,490
Or do I do two times?

2507
03:02:16,270 --> 03:02:18,410
I'm focused more on charge.

2508
03:02:19,430 --> 03:02:20,130
Or special.

2509
03:02:21,230 --> 03:02:22,650

Should head to the main square.

2514
03:02:29,750 --> 03:02:31,490
My attacks are mostly charged, anyway.

2515
03:02:35,050 --> 03:02:35,570

2527
03:03:30,670 --> 03:03:31,750
We really caught him, M.

2528
03:03:31,970 --> 03:03:32,550
Typhon, that is.

2529
03:03:32,730 --> 03:03:35,390
I saw him tumble down the dark side of the mountain to the
bottom and go boom.

2530
03:03:35,950 --> 03:03:38,970
Then later saw him slowly get back up and roar more angrily
than ever.

2531
03:03:43,230 --> 03:03:46,190
I'd more like to occur except for dodge and daze.

2532
03:03:46,570 --> 03:03:49,310
Most foes your sprint and gives you...

2533
03:03:49,310 --> 03:03:51,490
Oh, I actually don't know what to get for this one.

2534
03:03:57,640 --> 03:03:58,320
Two for future?

2535
03:03:59,480 --> 03:04:00,320
Or one.

2536
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:14,440
Hmm.

2537
03:04:22,220 --> 03:04:23,960
It could be good.

2538
03:04:24,500 --> 03:04:25,020
Hmm.

2539
03:04:34,290 --> 03:04:35,950
I need time to attack.

2540
03:04:36,090 --> 03:04:37,030
Okay, I'll do one.

2541
03:04:37,430 --> 03:04:38,630
One because of the building.

2542
03:04:38,650 --> 03:04:41,410
I'm at, because of the casting.

2543
03:04:42,670 --> 03:04:45,090
Oh, yeah, and the goddamn balls from Typhon.

2544
03:04:45,570 --> 03:04:45,570
Yeah.

2545
03:04:46,030 --> 03:04:47,350
Alright, this is the hard one.

2546
03:04:47,790 --> 03:04:48,490
I don't know which one.

2547
03:04:48,570 --> 03:04:49,190
Oh, wait, free money.

2548
03:04:49,350 --> 03:04:49,650
Let's go.

2549
03:04:51,850 --> 03:04:52,510
That's right.

2550
03:04:52,810 --> 03:04:54,110
Oh, it gave me, like, $5.

2551
03:04:54,670 --> 03:04:55,110
That's fine.

2552
03:04:58,960 --> 03:04:59,800
Alright, guys.

2553
03:05:00,180 --> 03:05:00,500
Look at that.

2554
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:02,080
Someone dropped money on the floor.

2555
03:05:02,620 --> 03:05:06,540
Alright, we have Zeus Magic Hef.

2556
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:07,880
Double Hef.

2557
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:08,820
Or Poseidon.

2558
03:05:14,850 --> 03:05:17,090
Zeus, because the duo is broken.

2559
03:05:17,250 --> 03:05:19,330
If we get the duo, do you think it's possible?

2560
03:05:20,430 --> 03:05:21,090
I'm gonna try.

2561
03:05:21,990 --> 03:05:23,010
Alright, let's Gamba.

2562
03:05:23,190 --> 03:05:24,490
It's Gamba time.

2563
03:05:29,830 --> 03:05:30,390
Gamba.

2564
03:05:35,460 --> 03:05:36,580
Gamba time.

2565
03:05:43,810 --> 03:05:44,710
Oh, that's fine.

2566
03:05:52,120 --> 03:05:53,020
Wait, that's...

2567
03:05:53,020 --> 03:05:53,920
Oh my god.

2568
03:05:54,060 --> 03:05:55,640
Okay, that scared the shit out of me.

2569
03:05:57,300 --> 03:05:58,160
Boon again!

2570
03:05:59,400 --> 03:05:59,960
Boon!

2571
03:06:03,150 --> 03:06:07,550
I forgot about this guy I'm surprised.

2572
03:06:07,770 --> 03:06:09,750
Oh, wait, I just realized I didn't have any moons

2573
03:06:14,430 --> 03:06:21,990
Oh, no, no, no, no, no deal I don't have yeah, I forgot I
don't even have a Zeus boon Our latest battle with him might

2574
03:06:21,990 --> 03:06:32,030
have gone differently if not for you Oh wait, do I have five
I have three I mean, I could build for it.

2575
03:06:32,290 --> 03:06:36,690
I have three right now So I could, I just need to grab two
more.

2576
03:06:37,290 --> 03:06:38,430
Or do I just get the attack?

2577
03:06:41,010 --> 03:06:43,970
I do have three right now, so I just got a build for it.

2578
03:06:53,780 --> 03:06:54,660
Three doesn't do much?

2579
03:06:59,440 --> 03:06:59,760
Hmm.

2580
03:07:00,380 --> 03:07:02,160
I guess I'll do two then.

2581
03:07:05,780 --> 03:07:06,800
Three is useless for you?

2582
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:07,780
Okay, I'll do two.

2583
03:07:09,460 --> 03:07:09,780
Alright.

Hey, hello, buddy.

Alright, let's grab.

Alright, concave.

2621
03:11:44,860 --> 03:11:46,080
His mom was a horse?

2622
03:11:46,220 --> 03:11:47,980
Why the fuck does he have one eye?

2623
03:11:48,380 --> 03:11:49,680
Horses have two eyes.

2624
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:51,500
Poseidon has two eyes.

2625
03:11:53,060 --> 03:11:54,380
What happened to him?

2626
03:11:59,860 --> 03:12:01,840
What the fuck happened to him?

2627
03:12:07,250 --> 03:12:08,990
Genetically, how does that happen?

2628
03:12:11,090 --> 03:12:12,850
Okay, oh nice, I got an octopus.

2629
03:12:14,310 --> 03:12:14,770
Or a squid.

2630
03:12:17,110 --> 03:12:18,910
Stop questioning the myths.

2631
03:12:19,230 --> 03:12:21,510
I just want to know what the fuck happened.

2632
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:32,520
Alright.

2633
03:12:34,760 --> 03:12:35,720
Oh, ash.

2634
03:12:35,980 --> 03:12:37,240
Oh, I can transform it too.

2635
03:12:42,210 --> 03:12:44,170
Let's get rid of this guy first.

2636
03:12:44,690 --> 03:12:45,690
Is that it?

2637
03:12:45,870 --> 03:12:46,450
Wait, where are the...

2638
03:12:46,450 --> 03:12:47,210
Oh, wait, what?

2639
03:12:48,070 --> 03:12:48,930
Oh, there he is.

2640
03:12:49,030 --> 03:12:50,130
I was like, where is he?

2641
03:12:50,170 --> 03:12:50,990
I think not.

2642
03:12:52,330 --> 03:12:52,730
All right.

2643
03:12:53,490 --> 03:12:53,890
Transform!

2644
03:12:55,110 --> 03:12:55,390
Yay!

2645
03:12:55,710 --> 03:12:56,070
Demeter!

2646
03:12:57,150 --> 03:12:58,310
Thank you, Flower.

2647
03:12:58,750 --> 03:13:01,910
Well, you've thrown our enemies upon this mountain into
turmoil.

2648
03:13:02,770 --> 03:13:04,330
Even now they attempt to regroup.

2649
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:06,090
But with your continued efforts...

2650
03:13:06,090 --> 03:13:09,270
His horses only have one eye, dokey.

2651
03:13:12,490 --> 03:13:13,690
Oh, wait, freeze.

2652
03:13:14,310 --> 03:13:14,930
Oh, wait.

2653
03:13:16,190 --> 03:13:17,010
We want that.

2654
03:13:18,010 --> 03:13:20,290
I don't think I'm in the...

2655
03:13:20,290 --> 03:13:21,430
We want three, right?

2656
03:13:26,840 --> 03:13:27,740
Or do we want two?

2657
03:13:29,700 --> 03:13:30,460
Two or three?

2658
03:13:30,840 --> 03:13:32,320
Six is a lot, though.

2659
03:13:39,600 --> 03:13:40,440
Three is good?

2660
03:13:42,160 --> 03:13:42,860
I'll do three.

2661
03:13:47,560 --> 03:13:48,560
Oh, okay, cool.

2662
03:13:49,400 --> 03:13:50,780
I mean, you were giving me two, but that's...

2663
03:13:50,800 --> 03:13:51,260
That's okay.

2664
03:13:52,220 --> 03:13:52,960
That's okay.

2665
03:13:53,140 --> 03:13:53,820
Almost there.

2666
03:13:54,080 --> 03:13:55,300
We almost got it, Echo.

2667
03:13:55,440 --> 03:13:56,640
We almost got it.

2668
03:13:59,460 --> 03:14:00,500
Jesus Christ.

2669
03:14:01,320 --> 03:14:02,440
I am so...

2670
03:14:02,440 --> 03:14:04,640
Oh my god, there's just so much stuff on my screen.

Okay, I want to get that over here.

2673
03:14:20,100 --> 03:14:20,880
There we go.

2674
03:14:21,080 --> 03:14:21,720
Oh hey, Ness!

2675
03:14:22,900 --> 03:14:24,100

2676
03:14:25,740 --> 03:14:37,260

anything the only issue i actually cannot see anything on my

2677
03:14:37,260 --> 03:14:45,600

03:15:23,400 --> 03:15:24,560
in the middle of the stream.

2683
03:15:24,840 --> 03:15:26,080
It might be beer o'clock time.

2684
03:15:33,580 --> 03:15:33,780
Alright.

2685
03:15:35,420 --> 03:15:37,380
A plus 10 and plus 2.

2686
03:15:37,780 --> 03:15:39,020
Seven encounters?

2687
03:15:41,180 --> 03:15:43,100
Okay, this is going to be worthless though.

2688
03:15:43,200 --> 03:15:43,480
Oh!

2689
03:15:44,940 --> 03:15:46,660
Okay, no, we're not doing acid.

2690
03:15:46,960 --> 03:15:48,140
We're not doing acid.

2691
03:15:50,180 --> 03:15:51,180
We'll do one.

2692
03:15:51,220 --> 03:15:53,040
I think all of them are pretty bad.

2693
03:15:55,200 --> 03:15:56,980
I think one is the only one.

2694
03:15:58,700 --> 03:15:58,980
Yeah.

2695
03:16:02,800 --> 03:16:04,060
We need to get moon.

2696
03:16:04,840 --> 03:16:05,760
Oh, moon is good.

2697
03:16:05,900 --> 03:16:08,580
I mean, I guess one is good with the upgrades.

2698
03:16:14,240 --> 03:16:14,680
Boom!

2699
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:17,380
And then I'll do this.

2700
03:16:20,360 --> 03:16:21,220
Alright, let's see.

2701
03:16:23,400 --> 03:16:23,840
Nice.

2702
03:16:23,920 --> 03:16:25,000
Oh, hey, there's moon there!

2703
03:16:25,460 --> 03:16:26,380
Oh, fuck.

2704
03:16:26,800 --> 03:16:26,800
Okay.

2705
03:16:27,320 --> 03:16:29,080
Moon or magic, guys?

2706
03:16:29,180 --> 03:16:31,960
Because I know we need to upgrade our moon, but we also need
more magic.

2707
03:16:32,160 --> 03:16:32,740
This is hard.

2708
03:16:36,560 --> 03:16:39,560
Do we commit to the moon or do we commit to the magic?

2709
03:16:46,950 --> 03:16:47,390
Magic?

2710
03:16:51,730 --> 03:16:54,010
Moon for money and more healing?

2711
03:16:54,850 --> 03:16:55,790
Oh, it's split.

2712
03:16:57,830 --> 03:16:59,630
It's so split right now.

2713
03:17:01,230 --> 03:17:02,330
No, I can only get one.

2714
03:17:02,410 --> 03:17:03,130
I'll do a magic.

2715
03:17:03,190 --> 03:17:03,630
Ugh.

2716
03:17:04,890 --> 03:17:06,090
I'm gonna do moon.

2717
03:17:07,290 --> 03:17:07,850
I'm doing moon.

2718
03:17:08,790 --> 03:17:09,630
It's way too split.

2719
03:17:10,750 --> 03:17:12,410
I have to make an executive decision.

2720
03:17:15,810 --> 03:17:17,150
And I chose magic.

2721
03:17:18,090 --> 03:17:19,050
Or I chose moon.

2722
03:17:20,590 --> 03:17:21,490
Heal too.

2723
03:17:30,660 --> 03:17:31,940
Oh, okay, here we go.

2724
03:17:33,840 --> 03:17:34,480
Uh...

2725
03:17:36,720 --> 03:17:38,160
10 plus 3.

2726
03:17:39,640 --> 03:17:40,200
Oh.

2727
03:17:41,060 --> 03:17:42,720
That is so much.

2728
03:17:48,890 --> 03:17:50,170
Which one should I get?

2729
03:17:57,020 --> 03:17:59,280
I don't know which blue I should get.

2730
03:18:00,540 --> 03:18:05,960
Should I get Panacea, Zeal, or Concerp, Panacea's my crutch?

2731
03:18:07,220 --> 03:18:08,600
Yeah, they're all good.

2732
03:18:08,860 --> 03:18:10,040
I only have three, though.

2733
03:18:10,340 --> 03:18:11,360
So, one.

2734
03:18:11,960 --> 03:18:13,420
I don't know which one to build for.

2735
03:18:14,540 --> 03:18:15,280
Bottom round?

2736
03:18:15,700 --> 03:18:16,300
Panacea?

2737
03:18:23,070 --> 03:18:24,750
Alright, we'll build for the bottom.

2738
03:18:28,030 --> 03:18:28,550
Okay.

2739
03:18:30,050 --> 03:18:30,870
Oh, hey.

2740
03:18:37,390 --> 03:18:37,910
Shaboya!

2741
03:18:39,450 --> 03:18:40,950
Hello, Circe!

2742
03:18:41,530 --> 03:18:44,050
That awful storm enveloping the mountain of the gods.

2743
03:18:44,310 --> 03:18:48,150
Why just the other night it cleared all brilliant moonlight
in its place.

2744
03:18:48,770 --> 03:18:51,870
I thought perchance you had achieved what you'd set out to
do.

2745
03:18:52,330 --> 03:18:52,670
Yeah!

2746
03:18:53,130 --> 03:18:54,710
Yeah, I had to do it five more times.

2747
03:18:55,470 --> 03:18:57,250
Ha ha ha ha ha.

2748
03:18:57,250 --> 03:19:01,170
It turns out the father of all monsters is not particularly
easy to dissuade.

2749
03:19:01,890 --> 03:19:06,270
I don't know who wants his vengeance against Lord Zeus more,
Typhon, Prometheus, or Kronos.

2750
03:19:07,810 --> 03:19:13,030
Our Lady Hecatee and you seek vengeance of your own, you've
met Caryptus in the Rift here, yes?

2751
03:19:13,390 --> 03:19:15,010
An all-consuming force.

2752
03:19:15,510 --> 03:19:19,690
When I imagine vengeance, all I see is that engulfing more.

2753
03:19:21,390 --> 03:19:21,950
All right.

2754
03:19:30,190 --> 03:19:30,750
Oh.

2755
03:19:33,150 --> 03:19:34,330
That's hard.

2756
03:19:35,250 --> 03:19:36,110
One, two, or three, chat.

2757
03:19:39,560 --> 03:19:40,740
Which would be the best.

2758
03:19:43,280 --> 03:19:44,160
One or three?

2759
03:19:46,640 --> 03:19:47,840
Three for Gamba?

2760
03:19:48,760 --> 03:19:49,860
Gamba time?

2761
03:19:50,080 --> 03:19:51,020
I swear to God.

2762
03:19:51,460 --> 03:19:53,960
I swear to God, this fucks me over.

2763
03:19:58,780 --> 03:19:59,380
Oh.

2764
03:20:04,790 --> 03:20:06,610
We're always Gamba, though.

2765
03:20:09,250 --> 03:20:11,330
We've always chose Gamma.

2766
03:20:12,090 --> 03:20:13,490
Gamma, fuck it.

2767
03:20:14,410 --> 03:20:14,910
What do we get?

2768
03:20:16,050 --> 03:20:17,110
The Unseen.

2769
03:20:17,470 --> 03:20:18,190
Wait, what was that?

2770
03:20:23,340 --> 03:20:23,740
Oh!

2771
03:20:25,660 --> 03:20:26,340
Wait.

2772
03:20:27,320 --> 03:20:28,300
Isn't that for magic?

2773
03:20:28,460 --> 03:20:29,400
That's good for my build.

2774
03:20:33,130 --> 03:20:33,270
Yeah.

2775
03:20:34,550 --> 03:20:36,770
No, I got passive regen.

2776
03:20:37,290 --> 03:20:38,450
The depth of her ability.

2777
03:20:39,050 --> 03:20:46,070
Whether as a practitioner of ancient arts or as a cook,
Yeah, that's pretty good, isn't it?

2778
03:20:52,380 --> 03:20:54,460
Yeah, I don't have to use my board again.

2779
03:20:57,960 --> 03:20:58,180
Oh.

2780
03:20:59,080 --> 03:20:59,480
Nice.

2781
03:20:59,700 --> 03:21:00,240
Got a tree.

2782
03:21:01,540 --> 03:21:01,720
Oh.

2783
03:21:02,800 --> 03:21:03,200
Nice.

2784
03:21:04,080 --> 03:21:05,140
I'll free honey.

2785
03:21:05,960 --> 03:21:06,520
Free nectar.

2786
03:21:09,780 --> 03:21:12,340
Yeah, but then I don't have to worry about getting more
magic, right?

2787
03:21:17,290 --> 03:21:20,330
But doesn't that mean I don't have to worry about getting
more magic, chat?

2788
03:21:22,130 --> 03:21:23,470
What the fuck?

2789
03:21:25,690 --> 03:21:27,970
What the fuck did I do so much damage to me?

2790
03:21:30,330 --> 03:21:30,790
Next bearing.

2791
03:21:32,630 --> 03:21:34,590
Alright, let's get...

2792
03:21:34,590 --> 03:21:35,550
Palm HP.

2793
03:21:47,920 --> 03:21:48,940
Let's see.

2794
03:21:49,300 --> 03:21:49,700
Palm?

2795
03:21:50,700 --> 03:21:51,740
Palm down.

2796
03:21:57,830 --> 03:21:58,830
That's right.

2797
03:22:00,830 --> 03:22:02,370
Don't come into my domain!

2798
03:22:09,180 --> 03:22:09,900
Okay.

2799
03:22:10,040 --> 03:22:12,040
Yeah, I'll grab this.

2800
03:22:14,760 --> 03:22:15,520
All right.

2801
03:22:18,360 --> 03:22:19,940
Attack steal more damage.

2802
03:22:20,280 --> 03:22:20,820
You're cast.

2803
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:23,900
Do I want me grinder or...

2804
03:22:28,500 --> 03:22:29,060
Hmm...

2805
03:22:29,060 --> 03:22:30,580
Three or one?

2806
03:22:34,480 --> 03:22:35,040
One?

2807
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:37,020
One, okay.

2808
03:22:37,820 --> 03:22:38,660
Oh, I shot.

2809
03:22:38,920 --> 03:22:39,560
Oh, I'm poor.

2810
03:22:40,100 --> 03:22:40,800
I didn't... I forgot.

2811
03:22:40,960 --> 03:22:42,580
I didn't grab any like money upgrades.

2812
03:22:42,860 --> 03:22:43,240
I forgot.

2813
03:22:43,260 --> 03:22:43,920
what that was like.

2814
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:47,020
I feel like all my runs have had money upgrades until now.

2815
03:22:49,420 --> 03:22:50,060
I mean, I can afford it.

2816
03:22:50,080 --> 03:22:52,400
Oh, I can afford Ares and food.

2817
03:22:54,640 --> 03:22:55,380
Yeah, duo!

2818
03:22:56,380 --> 03:22:56,740
Yay!

2819
03:22:57,920 --> 03:22:59,660
Make it the more visually we fight.

2820
03:23:00,060 --> 03:23:01,300
Is that not so, dear lady?

2821
03:23:01,340 --> 03:23:02,100
We got duo!

2822
03:23:03,880 --> 03:23:06,740
It was not I who made this personal, Ares.

2823
03:23:07,460 --> 03:23:13,240
Perhaps if at some future point you have your own children
and grandchildren taken from you, then you shall understand

2824
03:23:13,860 --> 03:23:17,260
For now, however, you need but to comply.

2825
03:23:20,500 --> 03:23:20,640
Oh!

2826
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:22,280
Wait!

2827
03:23:22,580 --> 03:23:23,680
And follows even as you...

2828
03:23:23,680 --> 03:23:24,180
Wait, what?

2829
03:23:24,960 --> 03:23:25,360
And follows?

2830
03:23:25,500 --> 03:23:26,300
What does that mean?

2831
03:23:30,020 --> 03:23:30,820
Oh, it's cute.

2832
03:23:30,920 --> 03:23:31,940
Wait, what does that mean?

2833
03:23:36,020 --> 03:23:37,440
Oh, does it, like, work?

2834
03:23:38,720 --> 03:23:40,860
Oh, cast is always on me!

2835
03:23:41,140 --> 03:23:41,620
Oh!

2836
03:23:42,620 --> 03:23:42,860
Oh!

2837
03:23:45,100 --> 03:23:47,300
I guess we'll try it, and I'll grab food.

2838
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:52,120
Oh, I will beat the Blade Fade Blade!

2839
03:23:52,700 --> 03:23:53,660
We're gonna let it rip!

2840
03:23:54,240 --> 03:23:55,200
I should have got the 50.

2841
03:23:56,960 --> 03:23:57,820
I got scared.

2842
03:24:02,350 --> 03:24:03,410
I should have grabbed.

2843
03:24:03,910 --> 03:24:05,650
I should have grabbed the palm.

2844
03:24:06,850 --> 03:24:07,250
It's alright.

2845
03:24:08,430 --> 03:24:09,950
I got scared a little bit.

2846
03:24:10,070 --> 03:24:13,290
I felt like I had so little HP, but then I remember I had
heal.

2847
03:24:13,830 --> 03:24:15,150
I forgot I had heal.

2848
03:24:17,530 --> 03:24:20,990
You're stubborn or just plain, you know, not that it matters
either.

2849
03:24:20,990 --> 03:24:23,090
The only issue I have to fight close to her.

2850
03:24:23,290 --> 03:24:25,550
You're standing between me and my objective, Aris.

2851
03:24:26,090 --> 03:24:26,790
Oh, floating.

2852
03:24:27,530 --> 03:24:30,490
The point is, sooner or later, you'll come to understand
that's a mistake.

2853
03:24:32,250 --> 03:24:33,830
But we all make mistakes, right?

2854
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:35,690
Neither one of us would be here otherwise.

2855
03:24:36,370 --> 03:24:37,470
So you ready now or what?

2856
03:24:37,850 --> 03:24:38,730
Let's have some fun.

2857
03:24:39,050 --> 03:24:39,530
Let's go.

2858
03:24:40,830 --> 03:24:42,090
Let it rip!

2859
03:24:42,330 --> 03:24:42,990
Oh, shit!

2860
03:24:43,670 --> 03:24:44,230
Guess not.

2861
03:24:45,370 --> 03:24:45,950
Oh, God.

2862
03:24:46,010 --> 03:24:46,550
Okay, it's fine.

2863
03:24:47,630 --> 03:24:48,910
Lady Rat!

2864
03:24:52,410 --> 03:24:54,450
Oh fuck, where's my frog?

2865
03:24:55,690 --> 03:24:56,530
I actually lost...

2866
03:24:59,450 --> 03:25:01,630
I like lost track of my frog.

2867
03:25:03,270 --> 03:25:05,970
There's too much shit on my screen right now.

2868
03:25:06,610 --> 03:25:08,490
I don't know where I am.

2869
03:25:12,380 --> 03:25:13,030
That's right!

2870
03:25:17,280 --> 03:25:18,250
Okay, we're...

2871
03:25:19,890 --> 03:25:21,990
I'm sorry, I actually used to heal.

2872
03:25:22,030 --> 03:25:24,270
I couldn't, I didn't, I can't see anything.

2873
03:25:30,800 --> 03:25:32,600
I legitimately can't see shit right now.

2874
03:25:35,240 --> 03:25:41,920
I think it doesn't help against her.

2875
03:25:42,180 --> 03:25:43,860
She's actually so hard to look at.

2876
03:25:46,180 --> 03:25:47,020
Oh, God.

2877
03:25:47,200 --> 03:25:48,140
Okay, I'll stand here.

2878
03:25:49,060 --> 03:25:49,720
Whoa, whoa.

2879
03:25:51,900 --> 03:25:52,660
Is she done?

2880
03:25:53,200 --> 03:25:53,800
She's done.

2881
03:25:55,400 --> 03:25:56,220
Oh, shit.

2882
03:25:58,180 --> 03:25:59,120
Let it rip!

2883
03:26:03,660 --> 03:26:04,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2884
03:26:04,880 --> 03:26:05,800
Stand over there.

2885
03:26:06,300 --> 03:26:06,760
Whoa, whoa.

2886
03:26:13,380 --> 03:26:14,500
I'll just stand here.

2887
03:26:15,400 --> 03:26:16,020
There you go.

2888
03:26:16,340 --> 03:26:16,720
Oh, my God.

2889
03:26:16,780 --> 03:26:17,440
No, my cover!

2890
03:26:22,310 --> 03:26:23,190
Don't worry.

2891
03:26:25,170 --> 03:26:26,370
We got the ripper.

2892
03:26:28,290 --> 03:26:29,370
Wait, where am I?

2893
03:26:31,770 --> 03:26:32,810
Wait, where's my frog?

2894
03:26:33,030 --> 03:26:33,650
Where's my frog?

2895
03:26:33,730 --> 03:26:34,150
Oh, there it is.

2896
03:26:34,290 --> 03:26:34,550
Oh, my God.

2897
03:26:34,570 --> 03:26:35,510
I got it!

2898
03:26:35,510 --> 03:26:36,130
I think back!

2899
03:26:39,140 --> 03:26:39,740
It's fine.

2900
03:26:43,920 --> 03:26:46,520
Oh, I had enough HP for that.

2901
03:26:47,480 --> 03:26:48,240
Get out of here.

2902
03:26:48,660 --> 03:26:50,200
I couldn't find my tank!

2903
03:26:52,860 --> 03:26:54,440
I couldn't find him!

2904
03:26:54,600 --> 03:26:55,800
He does like disappearing.

2905
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:58,380
He's doing shit on my screen.

2906
03:27:07,490 --> 03:27:09,010
All right, we got that.

2907
03:27:09,870 --> 03:27:11,210
It's knuckle bones time.

2908
03:27:13,450 --> 03:27:14,750
And then get the fountain.

2909
03:27:14,910 --> 03:27:16,750
And we're heading up.

2910
03:27:18,230 --> 03:27:19,510
Oh, we're heading up.

2911
03:27:20,210 --> 03:27:22,370
Guys, don't jinx the run, guys.

2912
03:27:23,110 --> 03:27:25,490
Sometimes it looks very believable.

2913
03:27:28,090 --> 03:27:29,610
What the fuck?

2914
03:27:29,950 --> 03:27:32,030
I wish I just need fast cast.

2915
03:27:32,830 --> 03:27:35,190
And then this run would be like the god run.

2916
03:27:36,890 --> 03:27:37,170
Oh, hey.

2917
03:27:38,530 --> 03:27:38,990

2918
03:27:39,050 --> 03:27:39,950
We actually needed that.

2919
03:27:43,950 --> 03:27:44,550

Okay, maybe like that took way too long, actually.

2932
03:29:28,340 --> 03:29:30,400
It's not really a fab that long that took.

03:29:31,780 --> 03:29:32,960
Just sat in the corner.

Okay, that's a mistake.

2957
03:31:29,620 --> 03:31:34,160
I was standing in front of my frog because I thought he
would block it.

2958
03:31:34,560 --> 03:31:36,800
He did not block it.

2959
03:31:38,500 --> 03:31:38,940
Okay.

2960
03:31:40,260 --> 03:31:42,220

Okay.

2986
03:34:01,580 --> 03:34:03,700
I don't have a lot of money right now.

2987
03:34:03,880 --> 03:34:05,500
Should I go for money instead?

2988
03:34:05,680 --> 03:34:08,100
Because I only have 146.

2989
03:34:08,940 --> 03:34:09,420
Yeah, no.

2990
03:34:09,500 --> 03:34:11,980
I saw high as my HP and that did not sound cool.

2991
03:34:14,360 --> 03:34:15,120
Money or health?

2992
03:34:17,360 --> 03:34:19,920
I don't have a lot, so I feel like I should.

2993
03:34:21,540 --> 03:34:21,800
Alright.

2994
03:34:23,960 --> 03:34:24,800
I just want...

2995
03:34:24,800 --> 03:34:27,200
I wasn't sure because I don't have free will right now.

2996
03:34:28,500 --> 03:34:29,580
Jesus Christ.

2997
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:32,120
Oh, that is not fair.

2998
03:34:33,180 --> 03:34:37,140
Their powers are in the fucking red dust, but my powers are
also red.

2999
03:34:38,680 --> 03:34:39,800
God, I hate that.

3000
03:34:39,980 --> 03:34:40,960
I must be healed too.

3001
03:34:41,800 --> 03:34:42,820
We need moon, though.

3002
03:34:43,700 --> 03:34:45,700
We're really low on the moon power.

3003
03:34:46,300 --> 03:34:48,380
And also, I have to kill these guys.

3004
03:34:48,580 --> 03:34:51,280
I am very scared of the snipers right now.

3005
03:34:51,980 --> 03:34:54,560
The snipers seem very scared.

3006
03:34:58,020 --> 03:34:59,400
Are you fucking kidding me?

3007
03:34:59,440 --> 03:34:59,540
Okay.

3008
03:35:01,340 --> 03:35:03,680
Oh my god, true snipers!

3009
03:35:07,000 --> 03:35:08,480
This is not fair.

3010
03:35:16,350 --> 03:35:17,130
I'll heal again.

3011
03:35:18,270 --> 03:35:22,450
I know I just used up all my healing, but I'm fucking poor
right now.

3012
03:35:25,530 --> 03:35:26,510
Alright, Ares or Pab?

3013
03:35:30,880 --> 03:35:32,880
No Athena, unfortunately.

3014
03:35:36,710 --> 03:35:37,290
Guys, I don't...

3015
03:35:37,310 --> 03:35:39,270
I don't think Athena's coming, guys.

3016
03:35:39,530 --> 03:35:41,730
I don't think she likes me.

3017
03:35:42,970 --> 03:35:44,310
She sees me as a threat.

3018
03:35:44,490 --> 03:35:45,490
Back in one piece, Talos.

3019
03:35:48,170 --> 03:35:49,570
Oh, babe late versus babe late.

3020
03:35:51,690 --> 03:35:54,090
Oh my god, I have no time to charge anything.

3021
03:36:00,140 --> 03:36:00,460
Whoa!

3022
03:36:05,440 --> 03:36:06,180
Oh god.

3023
03:36:06,640 --> 03:36:07,280
Oh god.

3024
03:36:12,830 --> 03:36:13,290
Okay, that's fine.

3025
03:36:16,510 --> 03:36:17,650
What the fuck?

3026
03:36:17,750 --> 03:36:19,010
Okay, that was bullshit.

3027
03:36:23,170 --> 03:36:24,190
AJ, time.

3028
03:36:28,470 --> 03:36:29,690
Are you fucking- okay, it's okay.

3029
03:36:35,400 --> 03:36:36,460
Okay, that's five.

3030
03:36:39,160 --> 03:36:40,160
We'll grab you here.

3031
03:36:41,820 --> 03:36:42,100
Oh!

3032
03:36:44,680 --> 03:36:45,900
You did it.

3033
03:36:47,660 --> 03:36:48,940
What did he take me for?

3034
03:36:51,040 --> 03:36:53,120
No more damage, inflict wounds.

3035
03:36:53,260 --> 03:36:54,180
Don't I have that?

3036
03:36:55,880 --> 03:37:00,300
damage, reflux, spill, plus strike in this location.

3037
03:37:00,540 --> 03:37:02,320
When you have...

3038
03:37:02,320 --> 03:37:03,200
Should I get one?

3039
03:37:03,640 --> 03:37:04,520
Just for the special?

3040
03:37:12,550 --> 03:37:13,330
One, right?

3041
03:37:13,910 --> 03:37:15,930
Oh, these two don't sound too good.

3042
03:37:16,930 --> 03:37:17,650
Peace can wait.

3043
03:37:18,690 --> 03:37:19,030
Alright.

3044
03:37:19,490 --> 03:37:23,670
I feel like I don't use Bore and Gain a lot, because I had
the recharge.

3045
03:37:26,170 --> 03:37:27,370
So I'm gonna do upgrade.

3046
03:37:28,690 --> 03:37:29,590
I don't need a recharge.

3047
03:37:29,650 --> 03:37:31,330

3053
03:38:18,460 --> 03:38:20,200
I love free stuff!

3054
03:38:20,920 --> 03:38:24,460
There has to be a way to vanquish Typhon utterly, not just
slow him down.

3055
03:38:25,140 --> 03:38:29,300
But if slowing him's the best result we can achieve for now,
so be it.

3056
03:38:29,860 --> 03:38:32,320
The so-called father of all monsters.

3057
03:38:32,800 --> 03:38:36,480
I heard the tales many times, of course, but seeing him...

3058
03:38:36,480 --> 03:38:37,600
Yeah, he's pretty ugly.

3059
03:38:37,780 --> 03:38:38,480
I get it.

3060
03:38:38,940 --> 03:38:41,120
Which was more frightening, even than the thing itself.

3061
03:38:43,760 --> 03:38:46,540
Guys, I didn't give me Divine Dash.

3062
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:50,360
Yes.

3063
03:38:55,710 --> 03:38:56,190
Okay.

3064
03:38:57,130 --> 03:38:59,630
I mean, I guess, too?

3065
03:39:01,450 --> 03:39:02,890
Monetary makes you deflect.

3066
03:39:03,050 --> 03:39:04,490
I guess, too, right?

3067
03:39:09,270 --> 03:39:11,230
Does it work with Held?

3068
03:39:12,110 --> 03:39:15,770
Yeah, okay.

3069
03:39:27,220 --> 03:39:28,260
Dora is 3.

3070
03:39:28,520 --> 03:39:29,860
30% damage?

3071
03:39:30,340 --> 03:39:31,800
I feel like 30% damage.

3072
03:39:38,470 --> 03:39:40,050
Okay, this is not fair.

3073
03:39:41,210 --> 03:39:42,370
This is a lot of people.

3074
03:39:45,430 --> 03:39:46,490
Okay, there we go.

3075
03:39:47,210 --> 03:39:48,970
A lot of people for $95.

3076
03:39:50,830 --> 03:39:51,630
Alright, we get it.

3077
03:39:51,650 --> 03:39:53,110
We gotta grab the heal.

3078
03:40:02,200 --> 03:40:04,360
What the fuck was he beating up?

3079
03:40:04,880 --> 03:40:05,820
Oh god, not these guys.

3080
03:40:06,080 --> 03:40:06,740
Oh, shit!

3081
03:40:06,840 --> 03:40:07,760
That scared me.

3082
03:40:09,320 --> 03:40:11,020
I wasn't expecting these guys.

3083
03:40:16,300 --> 03:40:16,960
That's fine.

3084
03:40:18,080 --> 03:40:19,040
Oh god, no.

3085
03:40:23,310 --> 03:40:24,190
Okay, it's fine.

3086
03:40:24,950 --> 03:40:26,190
I think I deflected.

3087
03:40:29,640 --> 03:40:30,160
Nice.

3088
03:40:30,940 --> 03:40:32,340
Oh, we need... Oh, nice!

3089
03:40:35,460 --> 03:40:36,500
Okay, uh...

3090
03:40:36,500 --> 03:40:37,800
We want that.

3091
03:40:39,160 --> 03:40:40,200
And then...

3092
03:40:47,570 --> 03:40:49,970
Oh, we have to build for that, too.

3093
03:40:54,940 --> 03:40:55,860
God damn it.

3094
03:40:55,940 --> 03:40:56,140
Okay.

3095
03:40:58,220 --> 03:40:59,360
Yeah, I have to go for the top.

3096
03:40:59,640 --> 03:41:00,840
But, like, will I make it?

3097
03:41:02,240 --> 03:41:03,880
Will I make it, though?

3098
03:41:08,760 --> 03:41:09,200
Yeah.

3099
03:41:09,900 --> 03:41:11,400
I should have built higher.

3100
03:41:11,820 --> 03:41:12,260
No!

3101
03:41:13,580 --> 03:41:14,700
I did it!

3102
03:41:14,720 --> 03:41:15,120
No!

3103
03:41:15,280 --> 03:41:15,700
Oh, shop.

3104
03:41:16,060 --> 03:41:16,380
Wait.

3105
03:41:16,900 --> 03:41:17,840
Will I get in the shop later?

3106
03:41:18,160 --> 03:41:18,920
I will, right?

3107
03:41:19,040 --> 03:41:19,480
41.

3108
03:41:19,980 --> 03:41:20,760
It's 50.

3109
03:41:20,840 --> 03:41:23,820
I don't have a lot of money, so I I feel like, ah, fuck.

3110
03:41:23,980 --> 03:41:26,420
The thing is, I don't think I need magic.

3111
03:41:26,680 --> 03:41:28,920
Because, like, I have the regen.

3112
03:41:29,200 --> 03:41:29,440
Yeah.

3113
03:41:30,120 --> 03:41:31,780
I have regen and everything.

3114
03:41:31,940 --> 03:41:32,480
So I don't need.

3115
03:41:34,080 --> 03:41:35,400
I don't need magic.

3116
03:41:35,900 --> 03:41:38,620
I haven't had, I haven't used up any of my magic so far.

3117
03:41:39,620 --> 03:41:40,700
Let's go for shop.

3118
03:41:42,820 --> 03:41:47,640
I just felt like I have just enough magic for all of this.

3119
03:41:49,660 --> 03:41:49,920
Alright.

3120
03:41:50,020 --> 03:41:51,600
I accept this message.

3121
03:41:53,780 --> 03:41:54,540
Oh, hey.

3122
03:42:00,310 --> 03:42:00,990
Two, right?

3123
03:42:07,080 --> 03:42:07,840
Nexus Rush.

3124
03:42:07,980 --> 03:42:08,440
Oh, my God.

3125
03:42:08,620 --> 03:42:10,420
My thing is, like, full right now.

3126
03:42:10,800 --> 03:42:11,660
Why does it always hitch?

3127
03:42:11,720 --> 03:42:13,280
It always gives me fucking hitch.

3128
03:42:16,600 --> 03:42:17,840
All right, here we go.

3129
03:42:20,660 --> 03:42:22,500
I swear, I always get the hitch move.

3130
03:42:23,140 --> 03:42:25,260
Oh, I have to be so close to him.

3131
03:42:25,320 --> 03:42:25,980
Do you hear that?

3132
03:42:28,120 --> 03:42:35,320
of the mountain even now impressive that you cast him down
before but he shall not rest till the palace of zeus lies in

3133
03:42:35,320 --> 03:42:43,940
ruin he'll be destroyed you along with him if that's what it
takes if he were truly unstoppable you wouldn't be impeding

3134
03:42:43,940 --> 03:42:53,000
my assent you're buying him time i am it's strange to think
that time can be a limited commodity even for deathless such

3135
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:55,460
as we but no i don't have any

3136
03:43:02,580 --> 03:43:06,320
Oh, my God.

3137
03:43:07,080 --> 03:43:09,440
I got hit by every eagle possible.

3138
03:43:18,660 --> 03:43:19,360
Okay.

3139
03:43:20,580 --> 03:43:28,680
Okay, middle, bottom, top, middle, bottom, top.

3140
03:43:31,140 --> 03:43:33,540
Oh, fucking, of course he goes this way.

3141
03:43:35,280 --> 03:43:36,900
Are you fucking kidding me?

3142
03:43:38,600 --> 03:43:40,240
Jesus Christ, you're such a whore.

3143
03:43:43,020 --> 03:43:45,040
Oh, my God, I hate him.

3144
03:43:47,700 --> 03:43:49,220
Not the fucking ego.

3145
03:43:52,140 --> 03:43:52,620
Really?

3146
03:43:52,900 --> 03:43:53,480
Oh, my God.

3147
03:43:53,560 --> 03:43:54,860
Okay, this is the worst part.

3148
03:43:55,120 --> 03:43:56,740
This is the worst part about this.

3149
03:43:56,960 --> 03:43:59,080
Okay, I'm, like, not doing well with this one.

3150
03:43:59,480 --> 03:44:00,900
Because, like, everything is...

3151
03:44:00,920 --> 03:44:01,640
It's red!

3152
03:44:04,460 --> 03:44:10,720
Top, middle, bottom, middle, top, middle, bottom.

3153
03:44:12,040 --> 03:44:16,580
Top, middle, bottom, middle.

3154
03:44:16,660 --> 03:44:17,000
Top.

3155
03:44:20,620 --> 03:44:22,260
Like everything is red.

3156
03:44:26,490 --> 03:44:28,010
Oh my god, not the eagle again.

3157
03:44:32,150 --> 03:44:32,570
Oh, my God.

3158
03:44:32,650 --> 03:44:33,550
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

3159
03:44:34,250 --> 03:44:34,790
No, no, no.

3160
03:44:37,330 --> 03:44:38,610
Okay.

3161
03:44:42,110 --> 03:44:42,910
Okay.

3162
03:44:45,570 --> 03:44:46,370
No!

3163
03:44:49,980 --> 03:44:51,860
I have to fucking resist.

3164
03:44:54,380 --> 03:44:55,140
Are you fucking kidding me?

3165
03:44:55,440 --> 03:44:56,740
Oh my god!

3166
03:45:03,440 --> 03:45:07,180
Okay, so I lost two death defiances.

3167
03:45:08,060 --> 03:45:10,600
So I only have one left.

3168
03:45:11,460 --> 03:45:11,500
Okay.

3169
03:45:12,660 --> 03:45:13,720
Badeblade is good.

3170
03:45:13,740 --> 03:45:17,160
But his attacks are red.

3171
03:45:19,320 --> 03:45:21,000
I couldn't tell.

3172
03:45:21,800 --> 03:45:26,220
I couldn't see his attacks because of the fucking bade
blade.

3173
03:45:27,360 --> 03:45:29,120
Because it's just all red.

3174
03:45:29,800 --> 03:45:31,600
So I couldn't see anything.

3175
03:45:33,960 --> 03:45:35,400
Oh my god.

3176
03:45:36,140 --> 03:45:37,280
Don't get hit.

3177
03:45:38,000 --> 03:45:40,860
I legit couldn't see anything on my run.

3178
03:45:43,780 --> 03:45:46,340
Your honor, his attacks were red.

3179
03:45:47,520 --> 03:45:50,100
Is there a way to change the attack colors?

3180
03:45:50,820 --> 03:45:58,340
Because, like, I hate how the Ares' thing fucking blends in
with all the attacks.

3181
03:46:03,300 --> 03:46:06,900
It's because everything happens so fast so the red blurs
together.

3182
03:46:09,260 --> 03:46:13,660
Like, because I have to react so fast, but it's all red.

3183
03:46:13,740 --> 03:46:14,680
of the gods.

3184
03:46:15,660 --> 03:46:18,580
I wish they'd, like, change the colors attack.

3185
03:46:18,680 --> 03:46:19,740
That's all I want.

3186
03:46:21,380 --> 03:46:23,420
I think that's the biggest issue.

3187
03:46:23,600 --> 03:46:28,440
I feel like, like, um, I honestly, like, this is all red!

3188
03:46:31,180 --> 03:46:33,560
Like, which one's my... Oh, my God.

3189
03:46:34,040 --> 03:46:35,640
Oh, my God.

3190
03:46:37,620 --> 03:46:41,240
Like, in Hades, it wasn't that bad, I feel like.

3191
03:46:41,540 --> 03:46:44,960
I think, like, in the first Hades game, It wasn't that bad.

3192
03:46:45,140 --> 03:46:47,400
But this in Hades 2, it's so bad.

3193
03:46:48,020 --> 03:46:50,500
It's actually like so annoying.

3194
03:46:51,900 --> 03:46:53,620
I'm so annoyed with it.

3195
03:46:59,810 --> 03:47:00,830
Alright, palm or hair?

3196
03:47:00,930 --> 03:47:01,990
I feel like palm, right?

3197
03:47:08,180 --> 03:47:10,820
Yeah, the visual clutter is just so dumb.

3198
03:47:10,940 --> 03:47:12,000
I hate the visual clutter.

3199
03:47:13,000 --> 03:47:13,060
Palm?

3200
03:47:14,840 --> 03:47:15,640
It's split.

3201
03:47:16,520 --> 03:47:18,760
Guys, why can't you guys be like the high mountain in
Pluribus?

3202
03:47:32,060 --> 03:47:35,340
I see more fine line is good.

3203
03:47:35,540 --> 03:47:36,220
What's fine line?

3204
03:47:36,700 --> 03:47:37,900
What does fine line give me?

3205
03:47:39,880 --> 03:47:40,260
Palm?

3206
03:47:40,420 --> 03:47:40,660
Okay.

3207
03:47:42,140 --> 03:47:43,080
I'll do palm then.

3208
03:47:45,220 --> 03:47:46,500
Oh, fuck!

3209
03:47:48,700 --> 03:47:49,400
Oh, God.

3210
03:47:49,720 --> 03:47:50,320
Not him.

3211
03:47:51,120 --> 03:47:51,820
Not him.

3212
03:47:54,840 --> 03:47:55,860
Okay, that's fine.

3213
03:47:58,380 --> 03:47:59,020
Okay.

3214
03:48:01,980 --> 03:48:02,980
Oh my god

3215
03:48:10,550 --> 03:48:13,830
Okay Oh god

3216
03:48:17,430 --> 03:48:20,550
Oh god that's fine I'm just gonna use this

3217
03:48:24,780 --> 03:48:27,540
I don't think the bay blade would be good for me

3218
03:48:32,840 --> 03:48:38,320
I feel like the bay blade is not as good Are you fucking
kidding?

3219
03:48:39,340 --> 03:48:42,620
Oh my god I fucking hate the range for this.

3220
03:48:43,460 --> 03:48:43,760
Oh

3221
03:48:49,060 --> 03:48:52,460
my god, I'm running out of heals right now.

3222
03:48:59,800 --> 03:49:00,480
Okay, it's okay.

3223
03:49:01,460 --> 03:49:02,240
There we go.

3224
03:49:06,320 --> 03:49:06,380
Oh.

3225
03:49:06,820 --> 03:49:08,900
I have only...

3226
03:49:08,900 --> 03:49:10,080
I only have...

3227
03:49:10,080 --> 03:49:14,000
I only have one more heal left.

3228
03:49:17,540 --> 03:49:18,600
Are you fucking...

3229
03:49:18,600 --> 03:49:18,980
Okay.

3230
03:49:20,520 --> 03:49:20,920
Okay.

3231
03:49:27,940 --> 03:49:28,620
Oh.

3232
03:49:28,760 --> 03:49:30,020
Oh, it does for cast.

3233
03:49:30,940 --> 03:49:32,020
Wait, I strike.

3234
03:49:32,340 --> 03:49:34,000
Because it has attack.

3235
03:49:34,220 --> 03:49:34,420
Yeah.

3236
03:49:35,680 --> 03:49:36,900
Because it does for cast.

3237
03:49:37,080 --> 03:49:37,540
That's good.

3238
03:49:40,120 --> 03:49:40,560
Alright.

3239
03:49:41,380 --> 03:49:42,780
That's always good for us.

3240
03:49:45,680 --> 03:49:45,980
Jesus Christ.

3241
03:49:46,400 --> 03:49:47,340
That's red!

3242
03:49:51,360 --> 03:49:53,000
It's all red.

3243
03:49:53,960 --> 03:49:55,640
It's just all red.

3244
03:49:56,600 --> 03:49:56,800
Red.

3245
03:50:02,440 --> 03:50:04,900
It's just off red.

3246
03:50:09,760 --> 03:50:10,640
Okay, there you go.

3247
03:50:16,180 --> 03:50:17,760
I'm going for...

3248
03:50:17,760 --> 03:50:19,800
I mean, it gives me one, though.

3249
03:50:21,160 --> 03:50:24,520
Oh, I only have one heal now.

3250
03:50:25,480 --> 03:50:27,860
I only have one heal, so I don't know.

3251
03:50:28,820 --> 03:50:30,340
Yeah, I only have one left.

3252
03:50:30,800 --> 03:50:32,720
Will it be worth it, chat?

3253
03:50:39,100 --> 03:50:39,880
I'll try.

3254
03:50:41,980 --> 03:50:43,560
Oh, my God, not you.

3255
03:50:47,120 --> 03:50:47,820
Oh, God.

3256
03:50:48,940 --> 03:50:49,480
Oh, God.

3257
03:50:49,940 --> 03:50:50,300
He's coming.

3258
03:50:50,700 --> 03:50:51,140
He's coming.

3259
03:51:04,300 --> 03:51:04,900
Oh, God.

3260
03:51:04,980 --> 03:51:05,820
He's coming, isn't he?

3261
03:51:13,370 --> 03:51:13,670
Oh, my God.

3262
03:51:13,750 --> 03:51:14,570
He's coming, isn't he?

3263
03:51:16,890 --> 03:51:17,230
Okay.

3264
03:51:18,070 --> 03:51:18,790
Oh, shit.

3265
03:51:22,850 --> 03:51:23,630
Oh, fuck.

3266
03:51:23,710 --> 03:51:24,110
He went down.

3267
03:51:24,130 --> 03:51:24,510
Wait!

3268
03:51:34,320 --> 03:51:36,180
All right, that's fine.

3269
03:51:40,060 --> 03:51:40,540
What the fuck?

3270
03:51:41,380 --> 03:51:41,700
Oh,

3271
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:48,560

3272
03:51:54,470 --> 03:51:56,010
Oh, what the fuck, bro?

03:52:00,830 --> 03:52:01,430
That's fine.

3274
03:52:10,400 --> 03:52:11,320
That's fine.

3275
03:52:16,760 --> 03:52:17,060
Yeah!

3276
03:52:19,200 --> 03:52:19,840
Oh!

3277
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:22,740

03:54:24,790 --> 03:54:26,470
This is okay.

3292
03:54:27,490 --> 03:54:27,970
Okay.

3293
03:54:29,330 --> 03:54:29,810
Okay.

3294
03:54:30,190 --> 03:54:32,250
I don't have a vision, too.

3295
03:54:34,710 --> 03:54:37,210
The palace of Zeus wasn't like any place I'd ever seen.

3296
03:54:37,610 --> 03:54:38,330
There is armor.

3297
03:54:38,550 --> 03:54:39,510
There is armor.

3298
03:54:39,950 --> 03:54:41,390
I don't know how you all could live up there.

3299
03:54:41,570 --> 03:54:42,450
I can grab everything.

3300
03:54:42,790 --> 03:54:43,570
Which must feel the same about where I'm from.

3301
03:54:45,250 --> 03:54:49,670
Well, I for one quite like it, Doc, but I've spent more time
in the underworld than everybody else up here combined.

3302
03:54:49,770 --> 03:54:52,330
As for the palace, at least it's kept us safe in all of
this.

3303
03:54:53,930 --> 03:54:54,850
Let's keep it in the way.

3304
03:54:56,270 --> 03:54:57,510
Wait, can I grab everything?

3305
03:54:58,030 --> 03:54:59,010
Calculate for me!

3306
03:54:59,670 --> 03:55:01,690
I'm too scared to calculate.

3307
03:55:02,290 --> 03:55:04,890
One, two hundred and seven...

3308
03:55:04,890 --> 03:55:06,030
Oh yeah, I can get everything.

3309
03:55:06,310 --> 03:55:07,250
I'll get Zeus first.

3310
03:55:07,630 --> 03:55:09,090
Hear me on my authority.

3311
03:55:14,740 --> 03:55:15,140

What are these attacks that he's using now?

3323
03:58:12,820 --> 03:58:14,300
I swear to god.

3324
03:58:15,400 --> 03:58:17,640
He did not use these attacks before.

3325
03:58:22,400 --> 03:58:23,160
Okay.

3326
03:58:25,900 --> 03:58:27,020
Yeah, where is it?

3327
03:58:27,580 --> 03:58:32,320

Oh god.

3335
03:59:59,980 --> 04:00:00,520
It's fine.

3336
04:00:02,580 --> 04:00:03,320
Okay.

3337
04:00:05,160 --> 04:00:06,640
Are you fucking kidding me?

3338
04:00:09,220 --> 04:00:10,600
He's losing his grip.

3339
04:00:10,620 --> 04:00:12,740

04:00:56,990 --> 04:00:57,990
I do not.

3344
04:00:59,450 --> 04:01:01,810
He truly is the worst one.

3345
04:01:02,870 --> 04:01:05,050
If only Zagreus could see me now.

3346
04:01:05,290 --> 04:01:06,630
He is the worst boss.

3347
04:01:13,830 --> 04:01:17,270
To all my family on the mountain, let me pass.

3348
04:01:21,560 --> 04:01:24,320
Just he gotta be strong, dokey.

3349
04:01:24,800 --> 04:01:26,380
Just be stuck.

3350
04:01:26,760 --> 04:01:26,760
Yes.

3351
04:01:27,040 --> 04:01:27,960
I don't know.

3352
04:01:28,680 --> 04:01:29,900
Oh my god.

3353
04:01:30,760 --> 04:01:32,400
There's so much pain.

3354
04:01:33,120 --> 04:01:35,800
There's so much pain fighting him.

3355
04:01:38,520 --> 04:01:39,260
Music.

3356
04:01:39,980 --> 04:01:43,340
The majestic palace of Zeus stands resolute and strong.

3357
04:01:44,220 --> 04:01:48,020
For the combined might of the gods has kept that seat of
power safe.

3358
04:01:48,600 --> 04:01:50,540
Even from such monstrous adversaries.

3359
04:01:50,980 --> 04:01:52,340
What the fuck you need me for?

3360
04:01:52,540 --> 04:01:53,820
You're gonna be safe anyway.

3361
04:01:54,800 --> 04:02:04,000
You don't even need me We got that monstrous fiend once more
young lady thanks most certainly to you such courage in the

3362
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:14,100
face of catastrophe and our palace remains safe and secure
and further reinforced should typhon try for us again It's

3363
04:02:14,100 --> 04:02:17,840
so safe anyway, can you let's go.

3364
04:02:17,980 --> 04:02:19,020
How about fight him?

3365
04:02:21,000 --> 04:02:30,180
But he's kind of ruining the vibe, you know in more ways
than one he's like don't worry olympus is very safe after i

3366
04:02:30,180 --> 04:02:36,420
killed typhon it's my pleasure to have been of service to
our family queen hera there's like yeah but he's like

3367
04:02:36,420 --> 04:02:47,300
ruining the scenery and like over the property value and
what do you have in mind on that account our own research

3368
04:02:47,300 --> 04:02:52,880
has yet to yield the force that could take typhon without
also taking this entire so and then he think it was richard

3369
04:02:52,880 --> 04:03:02,700
thinking just long ago i know at the us super chat they can
think you better not cry you better not cry you better not

3370
04:03:02,700 --> 04:03:12,440
cry you better not cry santa claus is coming to town i've
gathered useful specimens of typhon's flesh and we've been

3371
04:03:12,440 --> 04:03:20,300
studying how we can use it in our craft but we don't yet
have meaningful progress to share oh he's messing up the

3372
04:03:20,300 --> 04:03:27,760
garden more than once his progress meaningful Lord husband
thought that your first such victory could have simply been

3373
04:03:27,760 --> 04:03:38,940
a fluke what the fuck I like how we hear just Apollo fucking
belting it out while they insult me but now you've

3374
04:03:38,940 --> 04:03:46,720
demonstrated otherwise Melina we and spurred our hope that
we shall rid ourselves of this foul menace soon enough King

3375
04:03:46,720 --> 04:03:52,080
Zeus Queen Hera by your leave I ought return with what I
found in case it leads to new discoveries about how we can

3376
04:03:52,080 --> 04:04:03,000

did it apollo it's good to see you again cousin just as i

3377
04:04:03,000 --> 04:04:10,440
was beginning to fear my song would be tonight's sole source
of cheer because i don't know if i could do another one i

3378
04:04:10,440 --> 04:04:23,980
swear fighting typhod ages me like he's so stressful his
entire arena is stress but they couldn't leave their posts

my god take me home everyone i wish them well i don't know

well when next we meet return to shadow now all right we did

3381
04:04:41,540 --> 04:04:51,860
one one with wait did we want both friends with Momus or one
with Cersei and one with Momus.

3382
04:04:52,620 --> 04:04:54,900
Alright, I don't know which one I still like more.

3383
04:04:55,180 --> 04:04:55,920
Momus or Cersei?

3384
04:04:56,360 --> 04:04:57,580
I wonder.

3385
04:04:57,920 --> 04:05:02,140
Did the weavings of the fates foretell that I would knock
the father of all monsters down the mountain last night?

3386
04:05:02,360 --> 04:05:03,000
One to one.

3387
04:05:04,940 --> 04:05:05,960
Can they give us super chat?

3388
04:05:06,180 --> 04:05:06,520
Thank you.

3389
04:05:06,540 --> 04:05:07,080
I'm dead.

3390
04:05:07,260 --> 04:05:07,660
It's over.

3391
04:05:07,980 --> 04:05:08,880
What the fuck?

3392
04:05:09,040 --> 04:05:09,420
She won.

3393
04:05:09,480 --> 04:05:11,220
She can't keep getting away with it.

3394
04:05:11,300 --> 04:05:17,940
As such, the weavings of the fates tend not to be precise in
their detail, which I know can make them a bit confounding.

3395
04:05:18,820 --> 04:05:20,700
I salute your victory, Princess.

3396
04:05:21,360 --> 04:05:22,800
I'd like to thank that I, fortunately...

3397
04:05:22,800 --> 04:05:24,600
No, I thought I'd finish this game by now.

3398
04:05:25,000 --> 04:05:28,140
Because I thought that, you know, I...

3399
04:05:29,680 --> 04:05:31,280
Oh my god.

3400
04:05:32,280 --> 04:05:34,940
Oh my god, she's still here.

3401
04:05:36,260 --> 04:05:37,580

04:05:38,480 --> 04:05:39,600

3403
04:05:40,820 --> 04:05:41,220

04:05:55,320 --> 04:05:55,760

04:05:57,860 --> 04:05:59,600

3414
04:06:06,700 --> 04:06:08,140
