1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,660
It's actually not live.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,220
Because you know how on YouTube it's not instant?

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,860
Like the live thing is an instant.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,700
So like okay now we're live.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:09,680
I think.

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,520
Hey guys.

7
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,780
Wait I don't know yet.

8
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,740
My chat hasn't responded.

9
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,260
There's panning.

10
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:15,820
Do not mode.

11
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:16,540
RPR is gone.

12
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,580
Yeah time to wait.

13
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,860
RPR is late.

14
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,720
This is not great.

15
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,000
RPR is late.

16
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,600
Yeah he's still waking up guys.

17
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,280
Oh wait.

18
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,980
My chat's not showing up on stream.

19
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:30,920
Oh yeah okay.

20
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:31,420
All right.

21
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,600
We're actually live guys.

22
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,200
All right.

23
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,480
So we're waiting for RPR right now.

24
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,860
So it's just me and Rustia.

25
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,800
We were telling secrets.

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,600
Yeah we're telling secrets.

27
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,580
Yeah.

28
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,440
Oh no.

29
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,700
We're gonna give you FOMO.

30
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,800
I'm gonna backstab Doki Bird now.

31
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,380
No!

32
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,140
I'm gonna backstab you.

33
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,320
Yes I do.

34
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,160
Yes.

35
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,780
I do.

36
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,500
It's...

37
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:01,780
Really?

38
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,900
You got secrets for me?

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,020
Yes I do.

40
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,640
If I can't say it.

41
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,660
You should tell me after the stream.

42
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,480
What do you mean?

43
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,240
You literally...

44
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,520
We were talking about the beginning of the stream.

45
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,680
Where we're like whoa.

46
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:16,960
Whoa.

47
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,880
No that's...

48
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,920
That's actually not a secret you know.

49
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,380
That's not a secret?

50
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,360
Yeah.

51
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,420
We're talking like...

52
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,080
We're like...

53
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,780
Okay then say it.

54
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,280
I'm chatting about the aegis.

55
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,920
And then we're saying like...

56
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,180
Um...

57
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,040
Why is like aegis like um for like for chat next year is gonna be like in Sapporo right?

58
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,840
Like why Sapporo in like for championship?

59
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,380
Yeah.

60
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,400
Like should be Tokyo or like Osaka.

61
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,040
Because they're poor chat.

62
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,180
I didn't say that.

63
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,300
I didn't say that guys.

64
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,200
I love Apex.

65
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,920
I love aegis respawn.

66
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,480
You guys were great to me.

67
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,580
But anyway.

68
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,700
What Restia said was that he was saying that...

69
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,000
That Tokyo was too expensive.

70
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,200
Obviously I didn't believe him.

71
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,460
Yeah.

72
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,340
I think Sapporo is a great place for Aelgs to champion that.

73
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,340
Yeah.

74
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,640
Sapporo is a great place.

75
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:14,920
Yeah.

76
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:15,680
But it's...

77
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,820
No it's true.

78
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,840
Everybody knows.

79
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,300
Yeah.

80
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,360
It's gonna be beautiful.

81
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,120
It's gonna...

82
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,840
It's gonna be a lot of snow.

83
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,940
It's gonna be a lot of snow.

84
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,900
And they probably don't know like how heavy like snow is.

85
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I hope like the players coming in will like be ready for the snow.

86
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,400
Because I've been in Sapporo too.

87
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,000
It's known for like the winter.

88
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,300
I mean it's pretty.

89
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,040
It's just really fucking cold compared to other places.

90
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,040
Actually went to like Hokkaido in like five months ago.

91
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:52,500
Yeah.

92
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,060
Oh my god.

93
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,780
How was Hokkaido?

94
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,340
Yeah.

95
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,800
It was like...

96
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,160
It was fun.

97
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,240
It was like really huge.

98
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,400
I gotta say like the food is really good.

99
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:00,660
Yeah.

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
But like the point is I went out with like my family.

101
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,680
So it's like my mom and dad.

102
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,040
And then like...

103
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,300
They're pretty old.

104
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,040
So like they have like a...

105
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,420
Like I had a tour trip like for you know boomers for old man.

106
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,500
And then like the whole thing we did was eat.

107
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,780
We go on a bus.

108
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,500
We go to like a spot for 20 minutes.

109
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,360
And then we eat.

110
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,420
And we go on a bus and we go to the spot.

111
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,860
It's just the whole day of eating.

112
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:28,880
Yeah.

113
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,860
I mean that's great.

114
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,660
That's my ultimate vacation right there.

115
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,220
Just go eat and no tourist destination.

116
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,900
Somebody was like it's just two degrees.

117
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,800
Guys.

118
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,260
Yes.

119
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,180
But like they're going in February.

120
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,780
So it's gonna get cold.

121
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,600
It might be two degrees right now.

122
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,600
But they're going in February guys.

123
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,520
Not like they're going right now to Sapporo.

124
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,820
Yeah.

125
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,260
Did you see like the ice sculpture?

126
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,740
Oh wait.

127
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,840
Would there be ice sculpture?

128
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,020
No that's during the summer.

129
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,820
Right?

130
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,220
Yeah.

131
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,620
So like I also went to like Sapporo.

132
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,920
So it's like there's like even a little snow like left.

133
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,320
Yeah.

134
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,160
You know.

135
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,880
Even though it's just starting.

136
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,400
Right?

137
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,060
The snow is just starting and stuff.

138
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,440
No.

139
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,580
It's like just ending.

140
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,080
But like for like in winter.

141
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,120
Oh my god.

142
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,820
I think the org has no idea how it's gonna be.

143
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,340
Yeah.

144
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,240
So like the support guys in Japan is like oh my god February for championship.

145
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,440
Yeah.

146
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,140
I was gonna say why not more in the spring or like the summer.

147
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,680
I guess because like it's champions.

148
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,860
They can't really delay.

149
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,160
Champions always been in like you know in either January or February.

150
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,040
So like they can't really change the dates for the champions land.

151
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,700
So it just had to be that that day.

152
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,900
Wait you're gonna be there.

153
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,720
You have to cast.

154
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:53,840
Yeah.

155
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,800
Probably gonna be there.

156
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,180
Like probably not after today.

157
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,200
Yeah.

158
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,660
Yeah.

159
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,060
Probably not now after what he said today.

160
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,800
Guys remember to clip this and say.

161
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,520
No I already said.

162
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,140
Yeah what did he say?

163
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,520
You know it made me for like watch parties.

164
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,440
So they have like on-site watch parties.

165
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,000
Yeah yeah yeah.

166
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,680
They invite like different people.

167
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,320
Like they invite like nice wig.

168
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Yeah yeah yeah.

169
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,020
I like more probably the Brazilian streamers or stuff.

170
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:18,340
Yeah yeah.

171
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,780
I'm not getting paid dude.

172
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
I'm not getting paid chat.

173
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,380
Yeah but you get.

174
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,220
He gets a free hotel and travel.

175
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,960
Travel to Sapporo.

176
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
He gets free travel.

177
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,000
He's doing it for exposure.

178
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,040
He's doing.

179
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,980
Yeah yeah yeah.

180
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,540
That's the point.

181
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,040
That's what they actually told me.

182
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
For the exposure guys.

183
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,960
You know all I'm saying is that you know.

184
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,260
I would.

185
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,800
You guys don't even need to give me a hotel or flight.

186
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,720
I can play for my own hotel and flight.

187
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,780
But I'll do the official casting for them.

188
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,280
I.

189
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,920
Hahaha.

190
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,760
You could guys.

191
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,360
ALGS.

192
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,980
You can save.

193
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,900
Even more money.

194
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,680
If you hire me.

195
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,660
To take over Restia's spot.

196
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
I won't even.

197
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,800
I won't be able to speak it.

198
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,700
Speak Chinese.

199
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,800
But that's okay.

200
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,260
You can't speak Cantonese.

201
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,480
Even then I can't even know the Apex terms in Cantonese.

202
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,940
What do you mean Restia?

203
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,120
I don't even know what Apex Legends.

204
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,120
How to say Apex Legends in Cantonese.

205
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,740
Like what do you mean?

206
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,460
But I'll still do it for free.

207
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,120
By the way.

208
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,520
I'll still.

209
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:30,960
If you guys.

210
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,400
If you any.

211
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,620
If they want to save money.

212
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,580
I'll still do it for free.

213
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,340
See I'm a team player.

214
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
I'm a team player.

215
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,740
Right here.

216
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,780
I don't know.

217
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,940
Where the fuck is RPR?

218
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,540
How is he like.

219
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,720
Okay.

220
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,640
Like.

221
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,620
I guess like because.

222
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,340
I don't know.

223
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,280
I don't know if he's gonna be like face camming or whatever.

224
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,760
He said maybe he has to look presentable.

225
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,440
I have like a collab of 15 minutes ago.

226
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,280
It's gonna be fine.

227
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,200
It's gonna be fine.

228
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,800
They can wait.

229
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,700
Oh my god.

230
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,140
Wait.

231
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,700
Have you been playing rank Restia?

232
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,960
What's your rank?

233
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,120
Glatchem.

234
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,080
Not really high.

235
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,020
So I think it's fine.

236
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,440
Okay.

237
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,880
That's cool.

238
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,560
I'm bronze.

239
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,240
It's fine.

240
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,780
I definitely haven't been playing rank.

241
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,520
I was playing.

242
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,960
I was playing.

243
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,120
I was playing duos earlier like just pubs and I fucking hate E-district so much.

244
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,780
It's like I swear one.

245
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,900
It's the worst map that's ever made.

246
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,960
I don't know if you like E-district but I hate E-district so much.

247
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,640
I actually.

248
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,600
I actually like the map.

249
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:40,840
You know.

250
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,280
Really?

251
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,320
You like it?

252
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,040
Like what do you like about it?

253
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,160
I think it's like there's a lot of like cover.

254
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,140
You know like you can go close on enemies.

255
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,620
Of course like this third party is like really like there's a lot of third parties.

256
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:54,980
But yeah.

257
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,440
Yeah.

258
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:06,640
I like in like in close fights and I guess like it for rank it might be better because like if you're camping or whatever in rank but like pubs is so frustrating on E-district.

259
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,040
It's just it is so frustrating but I just didn't like the area where like there's like a specific area in that map where there's no loot.

260
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,900
Like I don't understand like it's just hide and seek like literally you could play hide and seek on that one section.

261
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
I still don't know what section it is.

262
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,400
Yeah.

263
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,120
Like because I landed there.

264
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,900
The funny part about E-district is like.

265
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,920
Oh probably like two weeks ago I actually like hosted a tournament and like.

266
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,220
Yeah.

267
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,420
Invited like all like the Taiwanese like big streamers and youtubers.

268
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,080
Yeah.

269
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,840
I made them and then it was supposed to be Olympus and World's Edge.

270
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,280
But like they made like a new map.

271
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,640
So Olympus was gone and then it was E-district.

272
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,540
I was not even in custom lobbies.

273
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,200
Actually like pick Olympus and custom lobbies.

274
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:49,800
What the fuck.

275
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,860
All right guys we're playing E-district.

276
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,380
Yeah.

277
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,620
Everybody was like no.

278
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,620
Yeah.

279
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,720
Like they're like.

280
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,900
But we practiced the other maps.

281
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,500
They actually didn't practice the other map.

282
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:01,840
But like.

283
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,340
Oh thank god.

284
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:02,800
Okay.

285
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,300
Yeah.

286
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,660
But I was like anyway I'm not playing so you guys are playing.

287
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,760
You're just like yay I get to just watch.

288
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,280
I mean that's good.

289
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,920
That's good.

290
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,540
At least you don't have to.

291
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,920
I'm just happy rank map isn't E-district.

292
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,940
I don't really like.

293
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,140
I know like maybe it's better for rank but I just.

294
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,020
E-district makes me so mad.

295
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,780
Yeah.

296
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,700
Because people.

297
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,080
People play so scummy in E-district.

298
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,440
People are like calling E-district like the basement.

299
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,820
The ba- Like we play two maps of War's Edge and everybody's like oh it's fun.

300
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,300
And then we're going to E-district.

301
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,920
No they're just like okay I'm going.

302
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,640
I'm gonna uninstall Apex now.

303
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,800
Oh my god.

304
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,600
So I'm happy.

305
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,240
I took my.

306
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,540
I took my chances.

307
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,600
All right.

308
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,520
Let's play one.

309
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,600
We could just play Knockout Rumble while we wait.

310
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,120
I guess.

311
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,020
For RPR.

312
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,240
Yeah nice RPR.

313
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,840
I wouldn't have to hear me now.

314
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,680
Yo bro are you out?

315
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,660
Like did he go back to sleep?

316
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,740
Like what happened?

317
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,540
Where is he?

318
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,400
Okay it's.

319
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,320
I'm gonna see if he's off.

320
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:10,720
No he's.

321
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,100
It says do not disturb.

322
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,280
So he's technically online.

323
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,750
Don't worry.

324
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,350
He'll.

325
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,290
He'll be back guys.

326
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,630
He'll be here guys.

327
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,250
All right.

328
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,770
Also by the way I know we didn't introduce Restia.

329
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:27,430
But if you guys don't know Restia.

330
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,530
He's a cat girl.

331
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,310
Or he's an actual cat.

332
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:33,750
He's an actual.

333
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,650
Yeah he used to be a cat girl.

334
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,790
Now he's just an actual cat.

335
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,270
Hey RPR.

336
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,450
Oh is he here?

337
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,090
How's your sleep?

338
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,330
Hey we're talking about how you're late.

339
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,990
You guys want to know what they said about you?

340
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,930
Time to wait.

341
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,310
RPR is late.

342
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:53,610
Wait.

343
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,790
The funny part is like.

344
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,710
RPR is mauled.

345
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,970
RPR is mauled.

346
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,650
I don't care.

347
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,410
This is the first time I'm late.

348
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,430
And I'm allowed to be late.

349
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,270
It's 8 a.m.

350
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,290
What do you mean this is your first time being late?

351
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,450
That is not true.

352
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:13,690
That is not true.

353
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,910
This is not your first time being late.

354
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,530
You've been late before.

355
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,350
I know you've been late before.

356
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,530
I've never been late before.

357
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:22,930
Yes you have.

358
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,090
I have not.

359
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,310
Yeah you have.

360
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,270
Okay when?

361
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,650
I just know you.

362
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,450
Okay chat.

363
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,770
When has he ever been late?

364
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,990
No because like you've been late so many times.

365
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,070
I don't keep track anymore.

366
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,570
Oh like what?

367
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,830
That one time when we played the Helldivers.

368
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:39,510
That was my fault.

369
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,110
Yeah.

370
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:41,130
Oh yeah.

371
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,490
Yes you were late then.

372
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,070
Yeah.

373
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,070
No I wasn't dumbass.

374
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,870
That was Axel.

375
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,730
That was not Axel.

376
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:49,110
That was.

377
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,610
Whoever the fuck.

378
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,570
Someone was late.

379
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,590
Oh what about one time we played.

380
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,070
What about that one time we played.

381
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,470
We played lethal company and I was waiting 20 minutes on you fuckers.

382
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,410
Okay.

383
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,730
What about chained together when I was on time and no one else was.

384
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,690
What about that one?

385
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:09,370
Okay.

386
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,270
I'm allowed to be.

387
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,930
No you were late then.

388
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,590
I remember.

389
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,510
I was not late.

390
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,350
Yes you were.

391
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,090
You were so late.

392
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:18,970
Anyway I'm in the fucking sub machine.

393
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,130
Oh my god why am I lagging.

394
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,150
I don't know.

395
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,210
No.

396
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,490
No.

397
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,050
No.

398
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,450
This is fine.

399
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,730
This is called karma.

400
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,690
No it's not.

401
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,010
Hey GG.

402
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,130
How have you been doing?

403
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,270
No it's not.

404
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,210
I'm terrible.

405
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,970
I have to wake up at 8am to play.

406
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:35,590
I'm okay now.

407
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,610
Yeah true.

408
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:37,110
What do you mean?

409
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,610
It's practice for BLGS.

410
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,830
Yeah.

411
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:40,150
Yeah.

412
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:42,810
Yeah you got to be up early for BLGS too.

413
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:45,510
It's okay guys I'm not.

414
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,750
What do you mean early?

415
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,370
BLGS is played at like fucking 8pm JST or something.

416
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,990
Yeah.

417
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:52,490
Yeah.

418
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,630
Yeah that's so.

419
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:56,810
Yeah it's just it's almost like 8am and you just swapped the two.

420
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,130
It's almost the same.

421
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,170
I actually asked like Doki if she can play at like 8am.

422
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,330
No he asked me if I could play at 4am in the morning and I was like no.

423
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:11,730
This was.

424
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:12,690
Oh no.

425
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,690
I got 2v1.

426
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,810
What the fuck.

427
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,910
Why do you mean why not?

428
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,950
If she gets to play at 4am in the morning then I'm fucking 8am in the morning.

429
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:17,970
No it's not.

430
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:19,490
It is not easier.

431
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,950
This is like.

432
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:23,210
You're awake anyway at 4am in the morning.

433
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:23,650
I am not.

434
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,390
What are you doing at 4am.

435
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,730
I go to bed.

436
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,510
I have so much stuff to do.

437
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,650
I go to bed early.

438
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,730
As in like.

439
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,270
Why do you lie?

440
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,370
What do you mean?

441
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,130
I am not awake at 4am.

442
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:36,310
When do you go to bed?

443
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,130
I go to bed at 1am.

444
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:39,830
Or earlier.

445
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,370
No you don't.

446
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,310
Yes I do.

447
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,230
Yes I do like.

448
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,230
I told.

449
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,270
I definitely do.

450
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,050
Yes I do.

451
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,150
I do.

452
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:50,050
Yeah all women do is lie bro.

453
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,010
Whoa.

454
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,710
I don't know what happened to you but I never lie.

455
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,750
No you don't.

456
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,310
Okay I am taking the zone by the way.

457
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,570
Yeah.

458
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,090
No.

459
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,150
JP are you.

460
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:02,890
Oh my god.

461
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:03,990
You definitely never lie.

462
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,130
I would never.

463
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,590
That's.

464
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:06,130
Fuck.

465
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,030
Are you.

466
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,150
Hey what rank are you guys?

467
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:09,070
Huh?

468
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,650
What did you say?

469
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,910
What rank are you guys?

470
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:14,670
I am bronze.

471
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,910
How the fuck are you bronze?

472
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:18,070
Because I don't play rank.

473
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,510
What do you mean how the fuck am I.

474
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,310
Okay I am a restiest plat.

475
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,170
What about you?

476
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:23,810
I am diamond.

477
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,130
What the fuck are you doing?

478
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:25,610
I am so weak.

479
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:26,270
Okay.

480
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,630
Fucking my dude.

481
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,550
What are you doing?

482
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,090
What are you doing?

483
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,870
No you are not going to fucking turn this shit on me.

484
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,190
No no.

485
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,970
What are you doing?

486
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,230
Why are you diamond?

487
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,850
The season just started.

488
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,150
Because I was playing ranked with my teammates.

489
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,770
What do you want from me?

490
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,250
Don't fucking blame me because you are fucking slacking off.

491
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,430
What do you mean slacking off?

492
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,630
I have other priorities right now.

493
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,350
I can't just play rank all the time.

494
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,950
I am a variety streamer.

495
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,090
Yeah yeah yeah.

496
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:56,290
Yeah variety.

497
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,290
I am a variety bullshitter.

498
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,630
I am a variety streamer.

499
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,870
Today I played Freddy Fish and the case of the missing kelp seed.

500
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,130
Oh you fucking nerd.

501
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,750
I am going to get water right back.

502
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,690
You are not even.

503
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:11,650
Okay okay.

504
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:12,590
I am getting water.

505
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:15,330
We are literally just waiting for you.

506
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:21,010
Okay I am capping right now.

507
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,190
Yeah look at us go.

508
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,890
We are nine points.

509
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,490
Or 25 points.

510
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:28,930
What is this?

511
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,910
I don't even know what to do in like this mode.

512
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,130
Wait have you not played this mode yet?

513
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,390
No I haven't played this mode.

514
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,870
You just it's just like capture the point.

515
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,730
Basically and then by the time the timer ends.

516
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,170
So like if a team doesn't get the required threshold.

517
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,090
So you can maybe try stab and look at scoreboard.

518
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:48,270
You get knocked out basically.

519
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,550
So like to get points you get kills and capture your zones.

520
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,530
And then each like I don't know how many minutes.

521
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:55,950
So like one.

522
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,390
After one minute and 40 seconds.

523
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,310
If we don't get the required points.

524
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,710
We basically GG.

525
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,750
Oh shit okay.

526
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,610
That is oh my god.

527
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,350
I am dead.

528
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,770
There is no fucking way.

529
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,370
So what the fuck are we going to play if we can't play rank?

530
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,370
Let's play rank.

531
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,150
I will fuck we will rank you.

532
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,130
We have to.

533
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,510
You can't play rank together.

534
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,630
Yes you can.

535
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,750
Did they change the update?

536
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,930
Yeah you can only do that.

537
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,110
Wait really?

538
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,030
Yeah.

539
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,730
No not if you three stack.

540
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:32,030
Unless did they change it?

541
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,350
Because in the past you could three stack if everybody.

542
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,190
Are you listening to me already?

543
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,670
When did they change it?

544
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,730
They changed it again.

545
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,550
Last three tiers.

546
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:41,950
So like if we three stack.

547
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,670
You can be like bronze.

548
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,370
You can only play with gold to die.

549
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:48,710
Are you?

550
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:52,710
Okay RPR just de-rank real quick for us.

551
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,230
Why is the hero in your chat saying.

552
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,430
You still can I think.

553
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,510
When this fucking dumbass idiot.

554
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:01,430
Asked me the same question yesterday in chat.

555
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,590
And I explained it to him.

556
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,750
And he's still fucking saying that you can.

557
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:05,830
When you can.

558
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,450
Okay maybe like maybe he tried it.

559
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,970
And he figured out that you can.

560
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,430
Have you ever thought about that?

561
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,450
You can't.

562
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,350
I don't know that.

563
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:14,750
Have you tried it out?

564
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,130
Yes.

565
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:17,510
When?

566
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,550
Fucking as soon as it was updated.

567
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,170
What do you mean?

568
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,530
It was updated fucking weeks ago.

569
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:24,610
Yeah.

570
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:25,310
But like.

571
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,910
Is it though?

572
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,010
Oh shit.

573
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,530
I got the.

574
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,650
Do you not have a.

575
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:35,850
Did you have like two.

576
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:37,170
Do you have like another account?

577
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,750
Yeah I have other accounts.

578
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,250
Does Rusty have other accounts?

579
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,030
I'm Platinum I'm fine.

580
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,210
Yeah he's Plat he's fine.

581
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,970
You can't.

582
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,430
Plat can play with bronze?

583
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:47,090
Yeah.

584
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:47,890
No.

585
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,090
Wait.

586
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,010
Well try it out.

587
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:50,950
Max three tiers.

588
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,730
I'm pretty sure Plat can only play with silver man.

589
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:54,890
Oh really?

590
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:55,950
We'll see.

591
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:56,310
Yeah.

592
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:57,690
Silver, gold, plat.

593
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,250
Three tiers.

594
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:58,530
Ah.

595
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,390
Silver, gold, plat.

596
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,550
Silver, gold, plat.

597
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,050
Ah got it.

598
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,430
Oh.

599
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:01,990
Okay.

600
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,910
We just can't count.

601
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,830
That's fine.

602
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,030
As soon as I get to silver.

603
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,070
Rusty can swap.

604
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,530
All right.

605
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:08,750
All right.

606
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:10,710
Yes.

607
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,490
It's that easy.

608
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,850
We're so good at problem solving.

609
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,290
We're not Chinese.

610
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,590
We're so good at problem solving guys.

611
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,450
I'm such a.

612
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,010
All right guys.

613
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,910
Let's search.

614
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:27,190
Let's smurf with Doki Bird and RPR.

615
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:27,590
Let's go.

616
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,590
Let's smurf with it.

617
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,350
Don't put it like that.

618
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,270
I'm just trying to have a good time.

619
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,090
I'm literally in bronze just fucking around.

620
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,430
All right.

621
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,950
We're going to boost Doki Bird today.

622
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,430
If anything goes wrong, it's not my fault.

623
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,070
What?

624
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,570
Fuck.

625
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:43,810
Wait.

626
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,250
I got to remember my other accounts.

627
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:49,950
Okay.

628
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,910
So this one.

629
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,070
You'll be getting boosted, RPR.

630
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:53,330
All right.

631
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:53,790
RPR.

632
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:53,870
Doki getting boosted.

633
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,890
Meet up there.

634
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,510
Nothing's changed.

635
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,530
Oh, Sapporo, Sapporo.

636
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:00,910
Yeah.

637
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,630
I'll be in Sapporo.

638
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,170
Oh, you're in Sapporo?

639
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,310
Yeah.

640
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,450
We're going to do our streams there.

641
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:06,910
Let's go.

642
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:07,250
I don't know.

643
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,490
I just know you went to Tokyo.

644
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,950
I didn't know you went to Sapporo too.

645
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,310
I'm going to be living in Japan.

646
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,430
Just going to Sapporo is going to be easy.

647
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,410
Oh, yeah.

648
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,450
By before the.

649
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,510
When are you going?

650
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,930
When are you like fully moving?

651
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:20,730
January.

652
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:21,910
January?

653
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,450
Oh.

654
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:24,990
We finally got the visa.

655
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,570
No, I didn't get the visa.

656
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,390
Wait, wait.

657
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,930
How are you?

658
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,530
Hey, guys.

659
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,050
They denied my visa, but I'm getting a different visa because they denied my other visa.

660
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,910
Here's my Steam code.

661
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,910
All right.

662
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:38,750
Oh, shit.

663
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,190
What the fuck?

664
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,410
This guy's lagging.

665
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,750
They made me wait nine months.

666
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:48,030
Yeah, I was going to say, you've been waiting for so long for that.

667
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,830
Shit.

668
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,090
It's probably you lagging.

669
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:52,490
Wait, probably.

670
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,030
You're right.

671
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,130
I was going to say, I'm probably the one lagging.

672
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,550
You're right.

673
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,970
I'm at 140 ping.

674
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,870
I won't be surprised.

675
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:03,850
Yeah, that guy's probably like, oh, my God, this guy's lagging.

676
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,170
Yeah, he's TP.

677
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,570
I don't mind that they denied me, but fucking nine months was crazy, dude.

678
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,710
Yeah, it did take nine months to deny you.

679
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,590
Yeah, it was crazy.

680
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,010
Oh, God.

681
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:21,450
Hey, at least, like, you know, at least, like, at least you could head there, you know?

682
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:22,650
No.

683
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:22,930
We just.

684
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,550
We just apply for different visas.

685
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:24,850
It's fine.

686
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,730
Wait, so what visa are you applying for now?

687
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:28,710
Entertainer visa.

688
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,930
That was easier to get than when you get an instant visa.

689
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:32,890
Wait, what was the one before?

690
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,770
It was like a work visa, like a very long visa.

691
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,910
Also, yeah, her, like, work visas are really hard to get because they don't recognize, um, they don't recognize.

692
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,610
They don't recognize esports as work.

693
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:50,450
Yeah, esports or, like, content creators for, like, not entertainment, like, work visa.

694
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,910
Well, they do, but it's, like...

695
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,990
It's really difficult.

696
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:01,570
Getting a visa in Japan is like going through a checklist, and you have to, like, get a certain amount of points or you don't get it.

697
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,150
Like, like, for instance, like, I haven't finished my college, so I don't have a degree.

698
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:13,430
If I had a degree, even though I'm working in esports, I'm not working in what my degree is for, I would still have more points in the visa.

699
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,830
It makes no sense.

700
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,290
Oh, I see.

701
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:17,970
Got it.

702
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:22,010
That's why when I'm in Japan, I'm gonna go to a language school and get, like...

703
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,390
A degree?

704
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,010
Yeah.

705
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:29,930
A certificate, like, for Japanese, and that will boost my fucking points a lot, and then I'll just apply for...

706
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,070
Oh!

707
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,210
Wait, that's interesting.

708
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,110
I didn't know that.

709
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,330
That you have, like, there's, like, a points system for that.

710
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,210
That's interesting.

711
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,170
Hey, that means...

712
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,430
There's a guy right in front of me.

713
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,610
Oh, he's so low.

714
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,610
The funniest part is that I have a full-time contract ready for me.

715
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:45,990
Yeah.

716
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,290
But it doesn't mean shit to them.

717
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,310
There is, like, because you just don't have a degree.

718
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,910
It just doesn't follow the...

719
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,170
It just doesn't follow the checklist.

720
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,070
No, author shit as well.

721
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:59,490
It's like, they're probably not sure that esports is, like, a legitimate business and blah blah blah.

722
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,990
I mean, does that mean...

723
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,430
Wait, but then wouldn't that mean that it'll be difficult to get a...

724
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,190
Oh god, we gotta go in.

725
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,250
We gotta go in before it's captured.

726
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,050
Yes, I'm contested.

727
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,030
Get what?

728
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,770
Sorry, we're playing that...

729
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,950
We're playing the knock-ups.

730
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,190
Oh!

731
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:16,390
No Mario!

732
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,270
No Mario 9!

733
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,290
There's, like, 20 people on here.

734
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,430
Yep.

735
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,250
It's okay, we're second.

736
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,150
We're safe anyway.

737
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:30,330
Wait, doesn't that mean it's gonna be difficult for ALGS players to go get a visa again?

738
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,070
No, because you don't need a visa to compete in Japan.

739
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:34,950
Oh!

740
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,190
Okay.

741
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:39,050
So the way ALGS works, right, is...

742
00:22:39,050 --> 00:22:39,510
Yeah?

743
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,090
You're not getting paid by the country where you're playing.

744
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,530
You're getting paid by ALGS.

745
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,070
And ALGS is stationed in NA.

746
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,130
Oh, so in Japan you don't need a visa to...

747
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,110
To play...

748
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:57,630
Most countries can visit Japan for 90 days without any visa.

749
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,950
Just, like, enter Japan for 90 days.

750
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,090
Oh, okay.

751
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,990
So you can just go play and then...

752
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,530
You're not gonna get paid in Japan.

753
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,110
So when you go back home, you're gonna get paid by ALGS.

754
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:09,970
Oh, so, like, only after it's over you get paid.

755
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,090
I'm learning a lot.

756
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,930
Yeah, only after...

757
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,570
So six months after something when they decide to pay you.

758
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,170
I mean, that's not any different from how...

759
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:18,890
From...

760
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:19,730
From...

761
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,030
From...

762
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,410
From...

763
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,930
Is that different from what they do in the...

764
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,430
Well, in the past, so...

765
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:26,950
Yeah.

766
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,110
I know, like, ALGS payments takes a while.

767
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,690
It's a process.

768
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,930
Yeah, she's learning about ALGS today.

769
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,790
She just learned that ALGS is poor.

770
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:36,150
Okay.

771
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:39,690
He didn't have to phrase it like that.

772
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,470
But yeah.

773
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,270
ALGS is not poor.

774
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:45,390
They're just fucking dumb.

775
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:46,930
Oh!

776
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,310
Oh, my God.

777
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,130
Oh, that's...

778
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,110
That's for my VR.

779
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,570
That's not me.

780
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,350
Oh, wait.

781
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,330
Why are they dumb?

782
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,450
Why are they dumb?

783
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:55,930
Oh, it's not them.

784
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,050
It's EA fucking locking them in fucking...

785
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,830
That doesn't matter, bro.

786
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:00,850
I'm not gonna talk about this on stream.

787
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,890
It's not per se...

788
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:07,090
It's not per se ALGS stuff.

789
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,050
It's EA fucking not allowing them to do all the shit they wanna do.

790
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,250
Say your truth.

791
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,130
Say your truth.

792
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,950
I mean, it's not my truth to say.

793
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,890
I don't give a fuck, bro.

794
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,010
Oh, my God.

795
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,750
I was on high graphics.

796
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,350
My whole entire graphics reset itself.

797
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,410
Are you fucking...

798
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,630
Are you fucking kidding me?

799
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,090
That's a great...

800
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,290
Everything was...

801
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:30,610
I was like...

802
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,830
Why am I lagging?

803
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,270
Everything is on high!

804
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,230
I don't even remember...

805
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,110
What, like, my settings are.

806
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,710
I'm with you guys on Steam, dude.

807
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,270
Guys, I'm in the game.

808
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:42,910
Like...

809
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,570
Like...

810
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,630
Oh, my God.

811
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,590
This makes so much more sense now.

812
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,370
Oh, my God.

813
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:50,990
Oh, my God.

814
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:55,470
I was like, why am I lagging so much?

815
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,610
It's good that I found out now.

816
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:07,070
As I said, I don't mind being denied.

817
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,950
I also kind of expected it to happen.

818
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,870
Because it was taking so long.

819
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,690
I was like, we're probably going to get denied.

820
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,050
Since it's taking so long.

821
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,730
That makes sense.

822
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,110
Holy fuck!

823
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:16,510
Okay.

824
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,290
I'm just happy they already made the decision.

825
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,970
So we can just apply for something else.

826
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,390
Yeah, apply before it's too late.

827
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,740
Okay, let me...

828
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,720
I haven't even finished lowering...

829
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,140
I don't even remember my actual stream settings.

830
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,960
I don't remember my Apex settings.

831
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,600
It should be all low.

832
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,820
Yeah, but then the texture streaming, everything.

833
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,280
I can give you a stream chance for it.

834
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,740
Yeah, yeah.

835
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,960
I'll steal your settings.

836
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,160
It should be like this.

837
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,340
Alright.

838
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,040
Don't worry, RPR.

839
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,000
We'll add you the moment we win this game.

840
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,400
So then we'll be champion.

841
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,020
I'll be the one from the game.

842
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,860
I'll be the one from the game.

843
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,540
The moment we win this game, we'll add you.

844
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,000
And then you're going to be like, Whoa, you guys got champion?

845
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,940
Oh, damn right we did.

846
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:10,800
Oh, yeah.

847
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,400
I mean, it says on the top right of your corner, unsafe.

848
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,580
So, sure you will.

849
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,660
What do you mean?

850
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,520
We're totally safe.

851
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,410
Hey, I'm 32.

852
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:23,670
I'm 37.

853
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,070
Oh, no.

854
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,030
Look at that.

855
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:28,630
Look at that.

856
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,370
I've got two kills.

857
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,350
Okay.

858
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,830
He stole my kill, but that's okay.

859
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,450
You guys literally lost.

860
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:41,930
No, we didn't.

861
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,230
Stop.

862
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,810
No, I needed that kill.

863
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:49,530
If we get Zeus' kill, we get it.

864
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,530
No, you did not.

865
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:52,050
No.

866
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:52,450
Yes.

867
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,750
You needed 30 points.

868
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:54,590
No, he didn't.

869
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,050
I'm sorry.

870
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,030
You don't know that.

871
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,530
I would have given you five.

872
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,150
No, you don't know that.

873
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,730
All right.

874
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,030
I literally know that.

875
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:05,990
It's okay.

876
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,370
We almost made it.

877
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:09,970
All right.

878
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,550
Okay.

879
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,230
Now I need to do my setting shit.

880
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:14,090
I need to fix my game.

881
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:17,350
All right.

882
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,810
I'm going to yoink Rustia settings real quick, guys.

883
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,190
Oh, yeah.

884
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,290
You got to swap accounts too, Rustia.

885
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,050
Yeah.

886
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:25,370
Yeah.

887
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,190
I'm doing it now.

888
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:26,910
All right.

889
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:27,690
Let's see.

890
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:30,350
Now I'm trying to boost Doki.

891
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,250
What?

892
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:33,410
Oh, wait.

893
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:33,590
No.

894
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,090
No.

895
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,050
What do you mean?

896
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,050
Oh, my God.

897
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:39,630
Why?

898
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:42,130
I don't even know when my settings reset.

899
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,070
It's been a while since I streamed Apex.

900
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,650
What servers are we going to play?

901
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:47,850
That's a good question.

902
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:48,730
It's based on you guys.

903
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,710
Well, I don't care, really, to be fair.

904
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:51,630
But not EU.

905
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,570
I actually do care.

906
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:54,130
As long as it's not EU, that's fine.

907
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,030
All right.

908
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,310
Where can Rustia play?

909
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,030
I can play Oregon and, like, whatever, outside of EU.

910
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:05,410
Yeah.

911
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,070
We both don't want to play EU.

912
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,450
Let's play NA, then.

913
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,550
I don't want to play on Tokyo, dude.

914
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,710
All right.

915
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,110
Let's play NA.

916
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:13,670
Let's go.

917
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,170
Let's go gambling.

918
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:17,330
Where the fuck is Oregon?

919
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:18,670
Oh, there it is.

920
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,850
It's the West Coast at the top for me.

921
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:23,890
All right.

922
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:24,910
No.

923
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,030
No.

924
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,270
What do you mean?

925
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,030
I already closed my game.

926
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,770
It's not letting me signing out.

927
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:29,430
Oh, my God.

928
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,610
All right.

929
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,410

930
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,850
No one cares where Oregon is, Donkey Bird.

931
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:33,610
No one cares.

932
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,050
Yes, I care.

933
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:35,970
It's my server.

934
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,930
I don't give a fuck.

935
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,470
Like, you can literally just join me because it automatically is Oregon.

936
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,270
I need to put my VPN on it.

937
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,750
You got to put your fucking VPN?

938
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,210
Because I don't put 300 million ping.

939
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,050
What do you want from me?

940
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,130
I don't know.

941
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,410
Maybe, like, adapt?

942
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,010
I don't know.

943
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:57,450
Okay.

944
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:58,850
I want to give you my VPN.

945
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,910
Why do I have to talk to you?

946
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,270
You're a professional gamer.

947
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,190
Ping wouldn't matter.

948
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,600
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

949
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,920
I'm not pro.

950
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,340
Yes, you are.

951
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,460
You're going to play BLGS.

952
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,380
That's so everyone can join that tournament.

953
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,320
Yeah, but you...

954
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,980
That means you're a professional player.

955
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,060
Why are you joining BLGS?

956
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,160
No, you're not.

957
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,300
You literally are not.

958
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,360
Like, you literally are.

959
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,060
Then why are you joining it?

960
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,960
The only thing that makes you a professional player is if you are paid to play by an org.

961
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,820
Yeah, aren't you paid by your org?

962
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,940
Not to play Apex?

963
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,160
No.

964
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,160
Then what's the point?

965
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,520
What's the point of what?

966
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,640
What's the point if you're not being paid for it?

967
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,760
Why did you join BLGS?

968
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,340
Yes.

969
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,140
It's like talking to a wall.

970
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,040
It's just like talking to a wall.

971
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,660
It's so exhausting.

972
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,360
I'm just here to wake you up.

973
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,280
You're not waking me up, you're pissing me off.

974
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,520
Yeah, you're gonna be more awake now.

975
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,440
No, I'm not.

976
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,580
I'm literally not gonna be more awake.

977
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,960
Wait, Rustio, what's your account thing?

978
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,840
Okay, nice.

979
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,620
I added RPR, but he hasn't accepted it.

980
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,540
I accepted it, dumbass.

981
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,620
No, you haven't.

982
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,160
Join me, fucking idiot.

983
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,020
I need to open the game.

984
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,220
Oh, I haven't even opened the game.

985
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:45,660
Okay, so if I open the game, what difference would it make when Rustio didn't even fucking add you yet?

986
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,400
Yeah, but Rustio is already in the game to add me.

987
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,360
No, he's not.

988
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,800
I'm already in the game.

989
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,580
I added Doki.

990
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,300
I'm in the game now.

991
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,240
Rustio's solo master?

992
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,060
That's right.

993
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,540
Rustio already added me.

994
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,100
Yeah, I'm already in the lobby now.

995
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:07,700
Where are you?

996
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,000
Yeah, where are you?

997
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,840
I don't care.

998
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,660
You guys can wait.

999
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,220
Oh, now he's gonna make us wait.

1000
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:17,780
Wow.

1001
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,020
That's fucked.

1002
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,320
That's so fucked.

1003
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,740
Why can't I skip this intro?

1004
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,580
This is fucking pain.

1005
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,220
Time to wait.

1006
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,560
RPR is late.

1007
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,860
Yeah, Rustio's a bro.

1008
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,840
I don't care.

1009
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,020
I just don't care if I'm late.

1010
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,080
I like don't give a fuck.

1011
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,960
Like, I genuinely don't.

1012
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,480
Look at that.

1013
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:47,520
Ever since he's gonna move to Japan, he thinks he's hot shit.

1014
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,680
Thinks he can just be late all the time.

1015
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,560
Well, Japanese won't be late, RPR.

1016
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah, yeah.

1017
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,020
You gotta learn to be on time.

1018
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,040
People don't like that in Japan.

1019
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,900
Just invite me and shut up.

1020
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,740
I did invite you.

1021
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,620
You didn't just join my lobby.

1022
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,620
Oh, it's not an open lobby.

1023
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:12,920
Never mind.

1024
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,140
Lobby's not open, dumbass.

1025
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,360
You're literally in my lobby.

1026
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,380
Rustio, your name is wrong.

1027
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,180
You're not even playing Solo Master.

1028
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,560
No, he'll just drop on the other side of the map so it's technically solo.

1029
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:33,240
I mean, he drops on the other side of the map and then, like, we'll figure it out from there.

1030
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,480
What he's in... Okay.

1031
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:38,240
Technically, like... Okay, but you guys are late, bro.

1032
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,040
Holy shit.

1033
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,300
Like, who can you guys ever be on time, bro?

1034
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,280
What do you mean?

1035
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,200
Look, he's always late, bro.

1036
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,060
That is not true.

1037
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,420
I've always been on time.

1038
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,020
That is not true.

1039
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,420
I'm always waiting for people.

1040
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Yeah, yeah.

1041
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,300
That's true, chat.

1042
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,840
It's not... You guys are liars.

1043
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,460
What even is... Okay, to be fair, we're playing Bronze, so meta doesn't matter anyway.

1044
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,600
Yeah, did you know that you should have streamed on Twitch today?

1045
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:07,420
Because for every 5 subs Twitch uses random gacha amount of subs.

1046
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,420
I heard that.

1047
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:17,760
I heard, like... I remember who it was, but somebody got gifted, like, 150 subs and they got, like, 100 plus subs or something.

1048
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,360
Extra.

1049
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,140
Someone apparently got gifted 37 extra subs on 5 subs.

1050
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,100
Wow.

1051
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,460
That's crazy.

1052
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,820
Also, apparently, IronMouse has gotten, like, over 3,000 subs from Twitch.

1053
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, from the gacha shit?

1054
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,280
Holy shit!

1055
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,120
We just got 3!

1056
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:36,900
Extra!

1057
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,380
Wow!

1058
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,120
Guys, guys!

1059
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,580
I might not be streaming on Twitch right now, but guys, did you guys hear?

1060
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,280
Nah, shut up.

1061
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,760
Did you guys hear about the extra gacha thing?

1062
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,040
Here, I'll link my Twitch, guys.

1063
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:55,560
I can't believe you fumbled so hard and you're streaming on fucking YouTube.

1064
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,700
Why not?

1065
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,460
I like YouTube!

1066
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,740
Yeah, but there's gacha on Twitch.

1067
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,560
I usually don't care about September.

1068
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,520
Yeah, but there's gacha.

1069
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,920
I don't even know there's a gacha event.

1070
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,780
You didn't even pay attention!

1071
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,840
How do you not know there's gacha?

1072
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,340
Like, when someone gives you 5, Twitch gives you random numbers.

1073
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,160
So fucking fun.

1074
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,220
I saw it.

1075
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,780
But I was just like, alright, just another day.

1076
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,340
How to get that passive income, I know.

1077
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,180
Guys, look, I'm not lagging anymore!

1078
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,020
I find my stream settings, I'm fucking fed.

1079
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,060
I'm not lagging anymore.

1080
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:36,480
Wow.

1081
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,060
Is that fucking crazy?

1082
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,480
Apparently you can get banned from offline gifting.

1083
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,900
I've been offline.

1084
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,000
My voice had offline gifting.

1085
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,100
It's only if you're like, not.

1086
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:46,600
GG.

1087
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,900
No, it's not!

1088
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,720
No, it's not true.

1089
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,120
It's only if they don't know who you are.

1090
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,500
Someone reported.

1091
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,640
Wow!

1092
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
It doesn't matter.

1093
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,080
I have an insider on Twitch.

1094
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,380
They know I exist.

1095
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,580
Karma should get your ass.

1096
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,960
It's only like that if they don't know who you are.

1097
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,880
And they're like, who the fuck is this person that's getting...

1098
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,760
They don't know who the fuck you are.

1099
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,360
Yes, they do.

1100
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,460
They don't know Twitch like that.

1101
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,460
Yes, I do.

1102
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,380
I'm literally Discord friends with the Twitch Rivals guy.

1103
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,940
No, you're not.

1104
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,300
I haven't followed him back on Twitter though, but like...

1105
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,040
Yeah, this is Karma.

1106
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,360
Karma's getting your ass.

1107
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,200
Get her off Twitch.

1108
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,140
Hashtag get Doki off Twitch.

1109
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,920
That's fucked up.

1110
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,080
Well, you can do like double streaming now.

1111
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,480
I don't like double streaming though.

1112
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,400
I don't like the splitting of the audience thing.

1113
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,080
I feel like that's just a bit too much.

1114
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,320
God, this skin is ugly.

1115
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,340
Oh, really?

1116
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,900
I know what the gacha event is now.

1117
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,060
I just saw it now.

1118
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:48,760
Yeah, the September.

1119
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
You get five...

1120
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,560
Guys, if you get five subs, you get like a gacha for like... It's great.

1121
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,980
A five for...

1122
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,660
X amount.

1123
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,580
I just want to see like a high number.

1124
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,260
I think the highest Twitch has given me was like four.

1125
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,280
I want to see like a fucking... I want to see Twitch drop like a bomb.

1126
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,300
Four?

1127
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
What a deal.

1128
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,300
Wait, I got level 10 train?

1129
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,200
Let's go.

1130
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,120
Thanks guys.

1131
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,460
What's the highest that we got?

1132
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,420
Because I just want to steal money from Twitch.

1133
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,180
Wait, I have Twitch chat on my stream.

1134
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
My Twitch chat showed up!

1135
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,840
On my overlay.

1136
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,640
I forgot I had Twitch chat on too.

1137
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,140
Oh, wait.

1138
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:35,820
Is that yours?

1139
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,460
What are you doing?

1140
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,620
Because I thought I was offing.

1141
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:46,120
Someone said they saw a free 70 yesterday and 100 gifted.

1142
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,000
Wait, that's crazy.

1143
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,840
That's crazy.

1144
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,700
Imagine that.

1145
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,260
I want to see it with my own eyes, dude.

1146
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,860
Guys, what's the highest that we got?

1147
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,700
That is literally scamming Twitch.

1148
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,640
This is literally legal scamming.

1149
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,080
Also, do you guys know about Twitch Prime?

1150
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,440
If you guys want to scam more?

1151
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,320
If you have a Twitch Prime, you can subscribe to your favorite Twitch streamer for free.

1152
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:12,260
And my channel is slash Doki Bird at Twitch.

1153
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,280
No one cares about Twitch Prime anymore.

1154
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,200
It's 2020, dude.

1155
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,800
Calm down.

1156
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,440
I care.

1157
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,540
How do we only get 2 for 10, bro?

1158
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,340
Twitch is scamming us.

1159
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,520
What the fuck is this shit?

1160
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,000
The highest I got was 24.

1161
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,880
What's the highest you got, RPR?

1162
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,660
I'm telling you, I got 4.

1163
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,400
Wow, I got 24.

1164
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,740
This is fucking sexism.

1165
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,420
Rocio, what's your highest?

1166
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
3 now.

1167
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
I just saw it, like, plus 3.

1168
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,640
Yeah, you see?

1169
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,360
Men don't get shit.

1170
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,640
Fucking bullshit.

1171
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,500
They're fighting over it.

1172
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,340
Maybe you should just stream more.

1173
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,980
Why is Twitch, like, giving us money?

1174
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,480
This is not the Twitch I know.

1175
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,100
It's Valorant, actually.

1176
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,800
This is Valorant, actually.

1177
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,880
Why is Twitch just giving us money just like that?

1178
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,240
It's Valorant, I'm telling you.

1179
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,240
That's so fucked.

1180
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,320
They take away our money.

1181
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,800
So it's actually Valorant giving us money, which means we're scamming Valorant.

1182
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,820
Oh, so Valorant is sponsoring it, basically.

1183
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,800
Yeah, we're scamming Valorant.

1184
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,440
Look at these guys.

1185
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,240
To be fair, Valorant, I'm going up.

1186
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,700
What do you mean?

1187
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:29,940
They're bronze, dude.

1188
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,220
I'm going up.

1189
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,840
If I die, I die to a bronze player.

1190
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:37,280
These guys, this doesn't matter if you're bronze, they're just AFK, dude.

1191
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,300
What are they doing?

1192
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,160
They were just AFK hiding behind a box, dude.

1193
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,980
Oh, shit!

1194
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,900
Wait, I'm getting shot by his teammate.

1195
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,160
They exist?

1196
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,280
That guy is so good at the game.

1197
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,140
Wait, that means there's another team down here.

1198
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,640
I got shot there, I think.

1199
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,800
Yeah, they were ratting them or some shit.

1200
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,780
Like, what are they doing?

1201
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
We're literally in bronze.

1202
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,600
What do you...

1203
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:04,840
Ah!

1204
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,800
You died to a bronze player!

1205
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,140
Res me, dude.

1206
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,520
Where are you?

1207
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,340
Oh, there you are.

1208
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,480
Next to you.

1209
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,520
What the fuck?

1210
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,020
Guys, if you die here...

1211
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,000
If we die here, we're fucked.

1212
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,580
I'm so laggy, holy shit.

1213
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,660
I might be dead.

1214
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,040
Goodbye.

1215
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,420
Res, you just killed someone, dude.

1216
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,280
Yes, I have!

1217
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,740
I literally just killed someone.

1218
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,700
That's my ult.

1219
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,840
I literally just killed...

1220
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,000
The wall doesn't revolve around you.

1221
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,240
Yeah, I'm heading over to help him.

1222
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,380
This guy is shooting my knockdown the entire time, bro.

1223
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,060
Just shoot this motherfucker, Doki.

1224
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,720
I'm literally shooting him!

1225
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,620
So demanding for something that died to a bronze player.

1226
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,880
I was standing still and scratching my face.

1227
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,380
Like, hello?

1228
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,560
He shot me and I still didn't move because I didn't think he was going to hit again.

1229
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,420
Res me, are you going to head over, Res me?

1230
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:02,820
Wait, I'm...

1231
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,980
Doki, you win that.

1232
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,160
They're only bronzes, dude.

1233
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:06,760
You're fine.

1234
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,640
Okay, I got two.

1235
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:11,920
Okay, I got two.

1236
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,060
I don't know where the...

1237
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,980
Where is the last guy?

1238
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,080
He was there with all of them.

1239
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,060
No, he's not.

1240
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,100
I'm literally there.

1241
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,380
I mean, I saw him.

1242
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,840
I was crawling and I saw him.

1243
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,440
I literally got two.

1244
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,520
Where is the last guy?

1245
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,020
I literally got two.

1246
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:27,020
Where is the last guy?

1247
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,780
The server is unplayable.

1248
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,900
Maybe you're just bad.

1249
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,980
Res and I are okay.

1250
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:32,700
Maybe you're just bad.

1251
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:32,700
Res and I are okay.

1252
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,840
I'm on 250 ping and I'm lagging.

1253
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,860
I played 250 ping!

1254
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,880
All the time!

1255
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:40,980
Did I ask?

1256
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:41,760
I don't think I asked.

1257
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,480
Well, you're complaining.

1258
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,620
Oh my god.

1259
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:50,240
Look.

1260
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,220
If you had to play on what I'm playing, you'd be crying.

1261
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,260
No, I won't.

1262
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,020
That's literally EU ping.

1263
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,640
It's not.

1264
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,500
You don't get this on EU ping.

1265
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,040
Yes, you do.

1266
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,680
Yes, I do.

1267
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,500
I'm on West Coast.

1268
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,520
Of course I do.

1269
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,380
No, you don't.

1270
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:03,940
No, you don't.

1271
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,160
You just don't.

1272
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,300
Alright, Resya, can you play 250 ping?

1273
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,100
Will you be able to?

1274
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,820
And you won't complain, right, Resya?

1275
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,700
I think I'm going to complain, to be honest.

1276
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,000
I think I'm going to complain, to be honest.

1277
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,020
How are they resed over there?

1278
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,580
It's not them, I'm pretty sure.

1279
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,620
I wish I could break the fucking...

1280
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
I wish I could break the zip.

1281
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,680
I wish I could break the zip.

1282
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,840
And send you guys fucking flying somewhere.

1283
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,720
And then just fucking kill you.

1284
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,380
And then just fucking kill you.

1285
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:36,100
Nah, nah, nah.

1286
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,980
You guys are blind.

1287
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,660
There's a literal person next to you, you fuckers, man.

1288
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,180
You're making me laugh so I can't aim.

1289
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,760
That guy's one, by the way.

1290
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,780
Did you kill the guy that was in front of us?

1291
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,400
Did you do it?

1292
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,400
He probably did.

1293
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:56,780
He's alive.

1294
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,700
There's one guy in there.

1295
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,960
What the hell?

1296
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,720
Damn.

1297
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,320
Wait, I have a gold res.

1298
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,860
I have a gold res.

1299
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,900
I can res you.

1300
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,700
They also have a gold res.

1301
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,040
I'm back, I'm back.

1302
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,500
I'm here.

1303
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,540
See, I got gold res.

1304
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,300
What's funny?

1305
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,300
These guys are fucking playing LGS down here, guys.

1306
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,280
You'll be fine.

1307
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,420
It's literally one guy.

1308
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,580
We killed his teammate.

1309
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,980
No, there's three guys down here.

1310
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,860
I killed... we knocked one.

1311
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,120
It's a Newcastle rampart in the fucking horizon.

1312
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,680
Alright, I'll go behind them.

1313
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:38,720
Yeah, I was gonna end the wall.

1314
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,040
Oh, they're running.

1315
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,000
They're leaving on my zip.

1316
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,320
They took your zip, yeah.

1317
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,660
They literally left.

1318
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:47,200
All of them?

1319
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,660
Yeah.

1320
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,080
I'm going.

1321
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,100
Alright.

1322
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,480
We'll watch you.

1323
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,740
Oh, they're resing over here.

1324
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:57,740
That's a different team.

1325
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,600
Yeah, but that's still a team.

1326
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,340
Yeah, but we don't care about it.

1327
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,260
Almost cracked him.

1328
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,500
Go in there, RPR.

1329
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:10,540
On your right.

1330
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:10,920
On your right.

1331
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:11,740
Behind you, Restia.

1332
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,240
What the fuck?

1333
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:17,080
Where did he come from?

1334
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:19,800
Oh, he should.

1335
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,580
He has a...

1336
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,020
Yeah, but where's this guy's third?

1337
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,680
I don't know.

1338
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:26,340
They had a horizon.

1339
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,640
Yeah, I think he's ratting.

1340
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,320
I mean, they have a new castle.

1341
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:31,140
So they're gonna craft.

1342
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,820
Wow, level 12.

1343
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,540
Thanks, guys.

1344
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,700
I really appreciate it.

1345
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:37,780
Thank you, guys.

1346
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,220
Level 12 hype train.

1347
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,240
Even though you're not serious.

1348
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,720
He's hiding down here.

1349
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,060
Oh, there he is.

1350
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,360
He's below us.

1351
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:48,900
I'm hiding right here.

1352
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,620
Wait, where?

1353
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,840
Did you find him, Restia?

1354
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,060
Oh, he did.

1355
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,980
Go, Solo Master!

1356
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,200
Okay, so there's another fight over there.

1357
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,120
Oh my god.

1358
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,140
I am bubbles.

1359
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,440
I don't think these people are gonna be happy.

1360
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,220
I can't wait to get drunk later tonight to fucking heal whatever's happening here.

1361
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,560
Aren't you having the time of your life playing with us?

1362
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:17,540
Oh, they're coming.

1363
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,540
Is he coming?

1364
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,660
Oh, there's a bow check.

1365
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,620
Wait, what kind of suicidal flying is this?

1366
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:26,960
Wait, where?

1367
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,220
Right below us.

1368
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,200
Oh shit, I'm hanging over here.

1369
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,280
I'm about to get solo cryptolted.

1370
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,500
That means they care.

1371
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:38,840
They're so scared of you.

1372
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,060
He stole that kill from you, man.

1373
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,200
Hey, there's a...

1374
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,400
We can get a Kraber.

1375
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,640
Yeah, we're definitely gonna get a Kraber now that you said that.

1376
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,140
I'm smoking it for you.

1377
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,600
Yeah, he can just sit there for 15 minutes.

1378
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,200
I'm smoking it.

1379
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,860
Alright, I'm gonna open it.

1380
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,920
They don't know.

1381
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,800
See, they're so stupid.

1382
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,400
They're literally running from it.

1383
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,140
I told you.

1384
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:09,820
They're so stupid.

1385
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:12,380
Oh my god.

1386
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:13,920
That's not from me.

1387
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,620
Oh, I want it.

1388
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,400
I'll take it.

1389
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,880
Why would you want that piece of shit?

1390
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:20,500
What do you mean?

1391
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:20,960
It's red.

1392
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,920
It can't be that bad if it's red.

1393
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:24,180
It's terrible.

1394
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,600
It's worse than fucking Nemesis.

1395
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,840
Is it worse than a vault?

1396
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,560
There's no way.

1397
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:32,480
Yes, you have a vault.

1398
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,020
Oh, I mean...

1399
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:35,640
Oh, shit.

1400
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,540
Guys, I need... guys, guys, guys, guys.

1401
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,740
Guys, I had a bow check, guys.

1402
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,560
You got put down by a bronze player.

1403
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,500
Yeah, I was literally the last person to get knocked by a bronze player.

1404
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,980
Somebody else got knocked before me.

1405
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1406
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,660
One of them is cracked.

1407
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,780
Please, please.

1408
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,040
You got knocked by a bronze player.

1409
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,320
Please, let's get turned around.

1410
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:00,200
Oh my god.

1411
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,120
You got shit on by two people.

1412
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,040
RPR didn't even come and save us.

1413
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:05,880
He doesn't care.

1414
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,500
No, why would I?

1415
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,680
I don't give a fuck about you.

1416
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,300
He doesn't care.

1417
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,080
Wait, I didn't die to a bronze player like RPR.

1418
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,640
I died to a silver player.

1419
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,820
That's different.

1420
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,880
What the fuck is this?

1421
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,500
That's different.

1422
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,500
Why didn't you die?

1423
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:24,500
Why did you just come from behind me?

1424
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,600
They are walking in the zone, dude.

1425
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:28,800
They are walking in the zone, dude.

1426
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,860
Anyway, requeue us, bro.

1427
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,040
Press 1.

1428
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,300
I can't believe it.

1429
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,280
Why is he doing here?

1430
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,540
I did.

1431
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,360
I literally...

1432
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,200
Look at you read.

1433
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,720
Open your eyes.

1434
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,840
Good job.

1435
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:42,960
You pressed 1.

1436
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:47,960
Look, I died to a silver player unlike RPR.

1437
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,800
Yeah, I just died to 3 of them.

1438
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,160
Yeah, I just died to 3 of them.

1439
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,880
To be fair, they were a silver masters player.

1440
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,580
They got masters last.

1441
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,620
Yes, they were.

1442
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,840
My guy was.

1443
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:02,680
My guy.

1444
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,960
I literally saw his masters badge.

1445
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,680
My guy had 14 pred badges.

1446
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,240
You can't even fit 14 pred badges on the banner.

1447
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,000
How would you know?

1448
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:16,220
Yes, you can.

1449
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,060
I saw it.

1450
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:17,860
How would you know?

1451
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,520
You didn't see it.

1452
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,020
I saw it.

1453
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:19,580
How would you know?

1454
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,440
I opened your stream and stream sniped you.

1455
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,020
No, you did not.

1456
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:23,840
Yes, I did.

1457
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,600
If you open my stream, then give 5 subs right now.

1458
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,820
Why the fuck would I give you 5 subs?

1459
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,060
There you go.

1460
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:33,440
You see?

1461
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,460
You didn't open my stream.

1462
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,920
No, I did, but I just didn't want to give you money.

1463
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,720
Nah, if you did, you should give 5 subs.

1464
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:41,080
Otherwise, you can't prove a point.

1465
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,780
You're right.

1466
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,900
I'd rather let you win than give you my money.

1467
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,740
There you go.

1468
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,200
Saw one.

1469
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,840
To me, it's equally satisfying winning or fucking getting 5 gifted.

1470
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,320
So I'll go fuck.

1471
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:58,880
He's just there with popcorn.

1472
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,740
Yeah.

1473
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,820
Wearing my sunglasses.

1474
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,820
He's just enjoying his time.

1475
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,680
Where the fuck is my name?

1476
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,780
I was actually opening up RPL streaming.

1477
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,540
You opened his stream.

1478
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,100
Oh my gosh.

1479
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:21,280
My chat thing isn't working for some reason.

1480
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,520
Guys, my chat's dead.

1481
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:23,520
I don't know what to do.

1482
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:24,880
Guys.

1483
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,660
Only my Twitch chat works for some reason.

1484
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:34,000
People can only see my Twitch chat.

1485
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:34,660
Guys, don't worry.

1486
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,980
I'm trying to fix it.

1487
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,420
Guys.

1488
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,740
Guys, don't worry.

1489
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,780
I believe in my Jumpmaster.

1490
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,660
No, I want to stream on YouTube.

1491
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,620
I hope they ban you on Twitch for saying that.

1492
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,000
Okay guys, protect me.

1493
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,400
I'm trying to fix my thing.

1494
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:56,980
Guys, I'm literally AFK right now.

1495
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,900
I'm literally AFK right now.

1496
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,300
Guys, guys, guys.

1497
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:05,920
I really need you guys to not let me die right now.

1498
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:07,140
Oh yeah, for sure.

1499
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:08,380
I got you.

1500
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,140
Okay, there we go.

1501
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,820
I'm sorry Twitch chat.

1502
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,120
Oh hey, you guys did it.

1503
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,820
I got P20.

1504
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,200
What the fuck is that guy doing?

1505
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,320
That guy's okay.

1506
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,160
Where are they?

1507
00:49:26,620 --> 00:49:27,260
I don't know.

1508
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,000
Oh, he's flesh.

1509
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,700
Nah, nah, nah.

1510
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,440
Bro, he's really flesh.

1511
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,280
He's one HP.

1512
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,100
How did you get knocked?

1513
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,580
What do you mean there are two people?

1514
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:39,780
I went straight in.

1515
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,480
Crazy.

1516
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:43,740
Okay.

1517
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,200
Okay, so Restia, we're not gonna save RPR after this, right?

1518
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,540
Yeah, true.

1519
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:52,300
Yeah, true.

1520
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,140
Okay, nice.

1521
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,740
That makes you believe that I'm the one that's gonna need saving.

1522
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,860
Restia, remember, I went in for you.

1523
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,200
RPR was out there fucking...

1524
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,820
I'm the one that killed the third player that was on me.

1525
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,760
I killed him, right?

1526
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,600
No, we didn't see that.

1527
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,460
You guys only killed two.

1528
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:09,440
We didn't see that.

1529
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,380
We don't know what happened there.

1530
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,580
So how would we know?

1531
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,340
Maybe he just threw a nade at himself.

1532
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,820
Of course he did.

1533
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,480
Maybe he just threw a nade at himself.

1534
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,140
You don't know that.

1535
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,220
I know that because I fucking shot him.

1536
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:28,540
What do you mean?

1537
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,440
It's he said, she said.

1538
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,260
It's literally not.

1539
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,580
It's a factual statement.

1540
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,460
It's a dumbass.

1541
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,500
Alright, Restia, you're the deciding factor.

1542
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,460
Who do you believe?

1543
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,140
That's why there's three of us.

1544
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,420
That's why there's three of us.

1545
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:48,580
That's why there's three of us.

1546
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,020
So you're the final vote.

1547
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,060
So you're the final vote.

1548
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,540
Based on what happened, RPR did me.

1549
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:56,720
Based on what happened, RPR did me.

1550
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,280
I was like, I gotta save Doki.

1551
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,080
And RPR was like, bro, I'm sitting here chilling.

1552
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:02,340
And RPR was like, bro, I'm sitting here chilling.

1553
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:02,900
Yeah, see?

1554
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:05,080
I'm not gonna save her.

1555
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,980
Why would I save her?

1556
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,720
She's supposed to be able to win.

1557
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,680
I came in here to help Restia.

1558
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,180
But that's not true, dude.

1559
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,840
What do you mean?

1560
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,780
You were the one on the ground.

1561
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:18,080
What do you mean?

1562
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,320
I pushed in because I saw Restia try to fight two people.

1563
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:23,500
Restia was fine.

1564
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,600
I was on top, dude.

1565
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,780
There's a guy right here by the way.

1566
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,320
Restia was doing fine.

1567
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:31,840
He came in and just died.

1568
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,640
I was a hero.

1569
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,240
I was a fucking hero.

1570
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:37,500
There's nothing heroic about just dying without doing any damage.

1571
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,340
What do you mean?

1572
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,900
I have damage right now.

1573
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,500
How much?

1574
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,440
I have 352.

1575
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,300
Stop lying.

1576
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:49,580
What do you mean?

1577
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm gonna go grab some heals though.

1578
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:57,660
What is that?

1579
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,460
Oh my god.

1580
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:01,680
Oh shit!

1581
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,580
Restia's getting smoked.

1582
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,480
What the fuck happened?

1583
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,000
I don't know, but he's getting smoked.

1584
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:10,040
I can't go in.

1585
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,120
There's a caustic gas here.

1586
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,040
There's another caustic gas right here.

1587
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,800
I need to grab this.

1588
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:20,320
Look, remember who res'd you and who's walking away.

1589
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,480
I killed two people that knocked him down.

1590
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,160
Yeah, my bad.

1591
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,400
My bad that I have to heal, you know?

1592
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,400
Yeah, you should have res'd him instantly if you're a good team player.

1593
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,340
Wait, where's the last guy?

1594
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,360
Oh, there's a crypto coming from there.

1595
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:39,660
That means he must be in here.

1596
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,240
That means he must be in here.

1597
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:45,400
Good luck finding the invisible guy.

1598
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:45,880
Good luck finding the invisible guy.

1599
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:46,900
I see him, he's right here.

1600
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:49,380
See?

1601
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,280
I don't think he has it.

1602
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,360
Oh wait, no, he does, he's blue.

1603
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:54,440
Alright, RPR, go get him.

1604
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,000
Don't tell me what to do.

1605
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,960
Alright then, I'll keep him walking away.

1606
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,420
If he gets knocked by him, it'll be so funny.

1607
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,140
If he gets knocked by him, it'll be so funny.

1608
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,400
I got an aura on him, that's great.

1609
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,920
Thank you guys for the level 14 hype train.

1610
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,180
Thanks guys.

1611
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:15,800
I really appreciate it.

1612
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,680
Why are you copying my skin?

1613
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,480
What do you mean?

1614
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,540
I always have a pink skin.

1615
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,140
My entire account is pink skin.

1616
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,660
It's not your yellow, not pink.

1617
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:29,600
It's not your yellow, not pink.

1618
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,040
Yeah, but my account here is all pink skin.

1619
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,020
Yeah, but my account here is all pink skin.

1620
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,200
Choo choo.

1621
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,300
Why does she lie all the time?

1622
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,200
What do you mean?

1623
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,200
I'm not a liar.

1624
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:41,020
When?

1625
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,820
Give me one example.

1626
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,760
Just now.

1627
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:46,680
How did I lie?

1628
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,520
Five seconds ago.

1629
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,080
How?

1630
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,020
What did I lie in?

1631
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,340
I'm gonna save rest here.

1632
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:06,040
I literally saw you heading to that building and I was like, alright, I'm gonna save you.

1633
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,260
And tank the whole shot.

1634
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, I was gonna go save you but I'm gonna get headshotted by a bronze.

1635
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:12,820
There's people behind us.

1636
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:17,270
Where are you shooting at?

1637
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:19,870
Are there people behind us?

1638
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,090
Like you just called it.

1639
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:24,910
Shooting at...

1640
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:27,490
I couldn't see them physically.

1641
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:31,110
I was hoping you would ping in.

1642
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,270
Like a good team player.

1643
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,970
I literally scanned it for you.

1644
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:36,490
In front of me?

1645
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:38,610
No!

1646
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:40,850
Hey, they're gonna jump down.

1647
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:43,990
What do they want?

1648
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:45,770
I thought they will.

1649
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,010
Wait, do I not have like...

1650
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,650
Wait, how does he see through that?

1651
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,750
How is he seeing through that?

1652
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,320
He's gonna be like, damn.

1653
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,220
He's gaming.

1654
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,700
Alright, give me your fucking shield.

1655
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,100
I have no shields left.

1656
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,060
That guy was weird.

1657
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:08,840
Yeah, I was gonna say.

1658
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,340
It was full on smoke, but he was hitting that shit.

1659
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,760
Was that all of them?

1660
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,000
With nemesis as well.

1661
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:14,300
Yeah.

1662
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:16,520
Yay!

1663
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,520
Does no one carry bats in bronze?

1664
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:22,740
I guess not.

1665
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,820
Oh, I have a key!

1666
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,620
There might be bats in the server room.

1667
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,960
I'm not opening that shit for like years.

1668
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,800
I'm not opening that shit for like years.

1669
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,400
There might be a bat in there.

1670
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,900
There might be a bat in there.

1671
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:38,640
It's been a long time too.

1672
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:42,980
Alright, I'm gonna open this first.

1673
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,160
Yay!

1674
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,600
Alright, guys.

1675
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,440
Knock, knock.

1676
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,350
Knock, knock.

1677
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:55,350
See, there's a phoenix kit.

1678
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:58,530
That's definitely a bat.

1679
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:00,110
Yeah, but...

1680
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:00,750
Nice.

1681
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,090
I mean, that was pretty good for me.

1682
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,930
I got so many upgrades for it.

1683
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,080
Yay!

1684
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,340
Where's the fight?

1685
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,280
RPR?

1686
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,040
On the right.

1687
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,280
Where?

1688
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,460
Do you have audio?

1689
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:23,420
No.

1690
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,260
Not on this game.

1691
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:26,940
Not on this game.

1692
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,280
Yeah, I didn't buy any skins.

1693
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,340
For the last two years, so...

1694
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,460
Cause you've been buying stuff.

1695
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:35,160
You've been giving respawn money so you get audio.

1696
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,780
I can't hear a guy standing still because he's just got the Dojutsu.

1697
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,360
He just has the bronze movement.

1698
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,940
You know, you're not used to it.

1699
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,820
Which is understandable.

1700
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:46,720
What?

1701
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,880
How am I getting hit?

1702
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,740
There's a guy behind this rock.

1703
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:52,180
Hey, don't get knocked.

1704
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:55,800
I had the box closing and I fucking hit that shit.

1705
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,780
Don't get knocked.

1706
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,720
Alright, turn that shit off.

1707
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,980
Alright, that's my ult, by the way.

1708
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,000
Oh, I cracked two!

1709
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:05,640
Let's go!

1710
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:08,940
Wait, where is he?

1711
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,580
Oh, what the fuck?

1712
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:10,840
Okay.

1713
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:12,280
Okay.

1714
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,300
Nice, I think you're dead.

1715
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,220
Hey, who...

1716
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,500
Rustia, where's your red armor?

1717
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,240
I mean, I'm...

1718
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,120
I'm like...

1719
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:24,820
You're in bronze, dude.

1720
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,560
And my two teammates are like...

1721
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,640
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

1722
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,620
What do you mean?

1723
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,380
We want to get out of here as soon as possible.

1724
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:33,940
Yeah, we want to get out of here!

1725
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,120
What do you mean so you can get on your main account?

1726
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,320
You want to be in bronze forever?

1727
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,220
This guy just wants to prolong bronze.

1728
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,140
This guy just wants to prolong bronze.

1729
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:44,800
He wants to farm the new players.

1730
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,120
That's fucked, Rustia.

1731
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,300
That's cyberbullying, Rustia.

1732
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:51,900
That's fucked.

1733
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:56,320
You want to make these poor Oregon players have the worst day of their lives.

1734
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,940
Okay, let's see what's our damage now.

1735
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,620
Our damage check.

1736
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,180
You want a damage check?

1737
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,820
Then why aren't you in army?

1738
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,320
What do you mean?

1739
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,800
You two are cyberbullying.

1740
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,060
You didn't defend RPR.

1741
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:19,620
The only way...

1742
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:24,020
The only way for us to get out of bronze is to cyberbully.

1743
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,620
Whoa!

1744
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,440
Wait, where are you shooting at?

1745
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,620
Over there.

1746
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,500
Give us a zipline.

1747
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:33,700
I don't have one.

1748
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,460
I just gave you one.

1749
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,420
You think I can just fucking get there in a second?

1750
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,180
I had something.

1751
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,060
I'm literally here.

1752
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,400
I'm literally here right now.

1753
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,180
I have a zip.

1754
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,840
Please don't type below to bully kid in my chat.

1755
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:45,640
Whoa!

1756
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,000
Nice.

1757
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:56,690
There's like people over here, by the way.

1758
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:58,790
Is that Mirage clone?

1759
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,930
Oh shit, that was.

1760
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:01,590
Wait, is he...

1761
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,030
No, I'm getting Miraged.

1762
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:06,150
I'm getting Miraged, guys.

1763
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,310
Wait, are there people on you, Ruscio?

1764
00:59:11,610 --> 00:59:13,350
It appears to be so.

1765
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:13,890
It appears to be so.

1766
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,330
It'll be fine, right?

1767
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,110
I don't know which one's the real person.

1768
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:23,910
I'm pushing up.

1769
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:24,270
Two homies.

1770
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,150
They're all in front of us.

1771
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:32,510
There's a lot of motherfuckers over there.

1772
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:33,390
There is?

1773
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,270
No, there isn't.

1774
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,350
Oh shit, wait, what?

1775
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,170
There's three, at least.

1776
00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:40,890
There's people over here in front of me.

1777
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:41,910
I got bow checked.

1778
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:45,330
I'm just gonna get that guy.

1779
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:46,030
Who the fuck is that dude?

1780
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,470
Really in front of me here.

1781
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:50,530
What is this raid doing?

1782
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:54,330
Wait, where are they?

1783
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,390
There's this guy that's just trying to...

1784
00:59:57,390 --> 00:59:59,330
That guy with the bow check is fucking Legolas, dude.

1785
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:02,470
Legolas is blind.

1786
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:04,870
Bro, he's shooting at me!

1787
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:05,650
What do you mean?

1788
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:07,730
I'm heading over.

1789
01:00:07,810 --> 01:00:08,450
Yeah, but did he...

1790
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,750
Did he hit?

1791
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,470
Yeah, he hit one shot out of four.

1792
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:12,810
Oh, he's running.

1793
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:13,910
He's been shooting for two minutes.

1794
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:14,970
Oh, wait, he has?

1795
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,970
Okay, now that's embarrassing, actually.

1796
01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:19,790
Alright.

1797
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:22,090
Are they...

1798
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,070
I'm just gonna ult them.

1799
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,670
Are they still running?

1800
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:26,350
No, okay.

1801
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,190
Oh no, they're re-involved.

1802
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,470
Literally one.

1803
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,230
Nice.

1804
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:32,890
Oh wait, that's my ult.

1805
01:00:33,290 --> 01:00:34,810
Whoops, I got hit by my own ult.

1806
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,890
Oh.

1807
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:43,110
Oh, are you both doing snake?

1808
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,190
Yeah, I got one.

1809
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,430
Oh, nice.

1810
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,750
Oh, you're trying to farm damage.

1811
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:49,510
I see.

1812
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,870
You're trying to farm damage!

1813
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,170
You're trying to farm damage now!

1814
01:00:58,390 --> 01:00:58,770
You're trying to farm damage now!

1815
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,290
I see.

1816
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,710
Why else would you use a fucking sentinel?

1817
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:05,510
Why else would you use a fucking sentinel?

1818
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,030
What do you mean?

1819
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,150
You literally did not have a sentinel before we cyberbullied you.

1820
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,410
You only got it after we started cyberbullying.

1821
01:01:18,770 --> 01:01:19,430
No, no, no.

1822
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:20,850
I don't wanna have high damage.

1823
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:22,190
You don't wanna have high damage?

1824
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:23,230
Throw your sentinel away.

1825
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:24,610
Oh, really?

1826
01:01:24,770 --> 01:01:25,190
Oh, I'm sorry.

1827
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:29,030
There's people in the ship.

1828
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,670
Oh, wait, no.

1829
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:30,610
There are people in front of me.

1830
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:31,090
What the fuck?

1831
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:34,710
What is he doing?

1832
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:36,770
What is he... oh.

1833
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:38,670
His fucking teammate is shooting me now.

1834
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:40,890
100.

1835
01:01:42,030 --> 01:01:42,590
88.

1836
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:46,790
I'll push up.

1837
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,030
Wait.

1838
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:51,450
Wait a minute.

1839
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,910
Why the fuck am I pushing up?

1840
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:59,230
What do you mean?

1841
01:02:02,330 --> 01:02:03,870
You didn't say anything!

1842
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:06,150
Why did I just say this?

1843
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:07,770
Why didn't you say this to me?

1844
01:02:07,850 --> 01:02:09,110
You should know this shit.

1845
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:11,350
I haven't played Apex in a while!

1846
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:12,130
What do you mean?

1847
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:16,810
Yeah, so you forgot that if the zone is not on you, you're not supposed to run away from it?

1848
01:02:16,830 --> 01:02:19,030
Look, I don't have depth perception right now.

1849
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:28,140
God, Spitfire's fucking long angle is rough sometimes.

1850
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,140
Horizons is almost cracked.

1851
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,180
He's like behind this box right now.

1852
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:37,940
Yeah, he is.

1853
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,060
Oh, he's still heading over there.

1854
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,620
He'll be in zone, right?

1855
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:49,200
Whoa!

1856
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:50,400
Why is that so fast?

1857
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,880
Oh my god, though.

1858
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,200
Holy shit!

1859
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,260
That was so fast!

1860
01:02:58,700 --> 01:02:59,540
Alright, nice.

1861
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:00,740
Oh, guys!

1862
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,000
Guys!

1863
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,360
Oh, I'm okay.

1864
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:09,700
I'm okay.

1865
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:12,960
I'm okay.

1866
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:13,600
I fell down!

1867
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,560
The fucking zip was so fast!

1868
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:18,640
Oh, what?

1869
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:19,640
There's three dudes there.

1870
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:23,440
They're playing zone.

1871
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,220
Like, they're scared.

1872
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:30,880
Oh shit, never mind.

1873
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,020
What the fuck?

1874
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:34,620
What is he doing?

1875
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,160
We have to be out of bronze from that game.

1876
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:39,960
There's no way.

1877
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:43,300
There's no way.

1878
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:49,400
Yay!

1879
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,380
Alright, how much did Rusty have farmed from the sentinel?

1880
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:56,520
In devotion.

1881
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,300
I need that Angus run.

1882
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:01,800
Unbelievable, dude.

1883
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:02,920
I'm not sure.

1884
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:03,540
Whoa!

1885
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,940
Yeah, but I'm playing Pathfinder.

1886
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,120
And everyone knows that Pathfinder and sentinel is just a perfectly normal combination.

1887
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,200
Wait, what's there?

1888
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,360
What do you mean I'm goofing around because we're in bronze?

1889
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,400
We're not in bronze!

1890
01:04:17,780 --> 01:04:18,500
Why would you want to stay here longer?

1891
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,180
Why would you want to stay here longer?

1892
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,720
Okay, guys, I need you guys to go back to the lobby because I'm not out of bronze yet.

1893
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:24,680
I need one more win.

1894
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,900
Okay, but you probably need to get up to gold, though.

1895
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:35,200
No, we just need to get to silver so Rusty can swap and we can play plat lobbies and get challenged mentally.

1896
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,460
And like have our neurons...

1897
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:39,620
No, I'm...

1898
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,200
I know that I'm a perfectly normal person.

1899
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,840
What do you mean you're a bird?

1900
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,060
You're special or what?

1901
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,520
Look, we had to have our neurons firing, okay?

1902
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,080
And plat, we can actually...

1903
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:03,960
feel like...

1904
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,540
things matter.

1905
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:18,040
Yeah, it definitely matters in plat.

1906
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,520
Yeah!

1907
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,780
It matters more than bronze.

1908
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:23,660
Are you trying to say Rusty doesn't matter?

1909
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:25,180
Alright.

1910
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,960
I got to challenge you and conclude that.

1911
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,120
You literally said plat doesn't matter.

1912
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,460
You're trying to imply plat doesn't matter, but Rusty is plat.

1913
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,600
Rusty is not a plat player.

1914
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:37,320
No, I'm a plat player.

1915
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,480
Just because you're in plat doesn't mean you're a plat player.

1916
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,020
Just because you're in plat doesn't mean you're a plat player.

1917
01:05:43,020 --> 01:05:43,780
Then what am I?

1918
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,180
Literally, I'm a plat player.

1919
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,800
You're just special.

1920
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,480
In a bad way.

1921
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:51,960
What does that mean?

1922
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,500
I'm not in a bad way!

1923
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:54,680
I'm not in a bad way!

1924
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
I'm just, you know...

1925
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,480
You know what?

1926
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:03,620
Just because you say that, I'm fucking playing Venture.

1927
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,320
You're playing what?

1928
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,200
Can you say that again?

1929
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,020
Oh, wait.

1930
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:12,040
Sorry, I'm playing...

1931
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,160
What is that you're playing?

1932
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,020
I thought it was the same thing!

1933
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,560
What's your name again?

1934
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,800
I'm sorry, I've been playing Overwatch.

1935
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:23,780
Are you playing Venture?

1936
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,860
Who the fuck is Venture?

1937
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:27,300
Vantage!

1938
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:28,680
I'm playing Vantage!

1939
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:30,360
Who the fuck is Venture?

1940
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,580
They both have the same age!

1941
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,320
They look the same!

1942
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:35,980
And their name is V!

1943
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:37,780
They have a V in their name!

1944
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,220
So I always get it confused!

1945
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,180
So you just...

1946
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:44,400
You said they're copying Apex Legends?

1947
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:46,020
No, I'm saying...

1948
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,000
I'm saying Apex...

1949
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:50,340
I'm saying...

1950
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,420
Which game was out first?

1951
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,920
Which character was out first?

1952
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,920
Overwatch came before Apex Legends.

1953
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,940
Yeah, but which character came out first?

1954
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,320
Overwatch.

1955
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:04,540
I've played Overwatch, I've never heard of a character called Venture.

1956
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:06,200
No, it's Vantage!

1957
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,200
Or Venture, I mean...

1958
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:09,620
Oh, you're talking about Apex.

1959
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:15,680
Yeah, be specific!

1960
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:16,980
You're confusing me!

1961
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,440
Can you guys do something?

1962
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,700
What do you want me to do?

1963
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:20,420
I'm Vantage.

1964
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:21,780
Shoot that guy.

1965
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,620
I'm heading over.

1966
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:26,860
There's another guy here, Rusty.

1967
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,320
If you want to shoot this guy...

1968
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,620
Don't worry guys, I'm here.

1969
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:31,960
Don't worry, trust in me.

1970
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:33,600
Where are they?

1971
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:35,540
I fell down.

1972
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:37,920
Wait, that's another team.

1973
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,680
Guys, there's three people.

1974
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,940
No, it should be just Catalyst.

1975
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:49,880
Oh, okay.

1976
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,680
I didn't realize there was this one guy.

1977
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:54,480
It's like she doesn't listen on purpose.

1978
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:56,460
Well, I don't listen to you.

1979
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,160
I listen to Restia.

1980
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,280
I'm going to stop calling.

1981
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:01,100
You have to call for Restia!

1982
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,600
He's listening.

1983
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:03,220
Nope, I don't.

1984
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:04,300
I literally don't.

1985
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,060
Oh, so you don't care about Restia?

1986
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,360
No, Restia can handle himself.

1987
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,580
Can you, Restia?

1988
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,140
Uh...

1989
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:13,740
Yeah, I definitely can.

1990
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,640
Who would do that to you?

1991
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,180
Who would bully you?

1992
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:25,060
Yeah, true.

1993
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,700
Oh my god.

1994
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:27,880
That's so fucked up.

1995
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,720
That you would do this to him.

1996
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,320
Yeah, that's so fucked up.

1997
01:08:32,540 --> 01:08:34,500
That you would do that to Restia.

1998
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:35,040
I would never.

1999
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:36,320
I can't hear you.

2000
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:37,220
I literally can't hear you.

2001
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:38,460
I mentally blocked you out.

2002
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,080
All I'm saying is that even though we're yelling at each other, we're doing really well as a team.

2003
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,500
No one's yelling at anyone.

2004
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:53,460
Why do you just keep lying?

2005
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:54,520
What do you mean?

2006
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:57,580
There's just a...

2007
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:58,900
In my head, I'm yelling at you.

2008
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:01,480
Alright, I am...

2009
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,740
That means you're a mentalist.

2010
01:09:04,160 --> 01:09:06,260
There's so many people at Estates, by the way.

2011
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,960
There's so many people at Estates, by the way.

2012
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,540
Just kill them.

2013
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,300
Oh my god.

2014
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:11,380
That's so many kills.

2015
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:12,280
Go.

2016
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,500
In the car.

2017
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:18,320
Oh, look at that.

2018
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:18,840
Look at that.

2019
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,860
RPR left us.

2020
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,200
Look at that.

2021
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:22,360
You bitch.

2022
01:09:22,460 --> 01:09:23,480
You're such a whore.

2023
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:25,680
You're actually a fucking whore.

2024
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:27,120
You're actually a fucking whore.

2025
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,540
Rusty, are you going to let him do that to me?

2026
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,620
I'm on the car with him.

2027
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:37,100
I hope you guys die in that fight.

2028
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,080
Oh my god.

2029
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,440
Rusty, you're literally going to die because of that.

2030
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,440
That's fucking karma.

2031
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:42,860
That's literally karma.

2032
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:43,900
I don't care if it's worth it.

2033
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,880
If you die, it's still worth it.

2034
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,240
I am taking fire, friends.

2035
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,700
Rope that enemy shield.

2036
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:51,960
Oh my god!

2037
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:54,160
What the fuck?

2038
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:54,360
What?

2039
01:09:56,380 --> 01:09:58,220
Where the fuck did this guy come from?

2040
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,860
Oh, guys!

2041
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:01,780
There's literally a team right behind you guys.

2042
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:07,920
I killed.

2043
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,960
Alright, there's like a full team right behind you guys, by the way.

2044
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:16,740
I killed those guys.

2045
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:18,580
You killed the lifeline and Sheila?

2046
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,780
Yeah, that's the wrong part, but I know the lifeline.

2047
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:23,280
I mean, he was holding a Sheila.

2048
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,980
Lifeline cannot hold a Sheila.

2049
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,980
No, the lifeline...

2050
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,640
The lifeline and the girl that held the Sheila.

2051
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:31,840
The girl who held the Sheila.

2052
01:10:35,180 --> 01:10:36,800
That's the wrong part, by the way.

2053
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:37,380
Yeah, yeah!

2054
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,200
That's literally... I'm just saying it in faster language.

2055
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,220
No, it's Reaper from Overwatch.

2056
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:42,840
Yeah.

2057
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:44,520
True.

2058
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:48,800
Alright, I'm going to scav.

2059
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,600
Wait, there's people right behind us.

2060
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:51,720
Come if you want.

2061
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,460
Good.

2062
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:55,020
Shoot them.

2063
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,380
I am shooting them.

2064
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,600
What the fuck are you guys doing?

2065
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:58,240
Kill them, then.

2066
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:00,120
Alright.

2067
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,600
I'm wondering why you haven't knocked anyone yet.

2068
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,320
Because I'm watching Restia.

2069
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:07,820
There you go.

2070
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,080
She's kill stealing, dude.

2071
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:13,020
She just KS'd so hard.

2072
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,180
Oh, what are you doing?

2073
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,400
Oh, what are you doing?

2074
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,040
Damn, why are you not fucking helping him?

2075
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:23,360
Why are you not helping him?

2076
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,200
Because Restia said he can take care of himself.

2077
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,600
So I want to see him take care of himself.

2078
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:29,000
And save people.

2079
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:32,140
I literally saved you from two of them.

2080
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:33,080
What do you mean?

2081
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:34,460
You did not help at all.

2082
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,480
I literally saw you watch him get shit on.

2083
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,200
Yeah, but I didn't say I was going to help.

2084
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,780
And you keep saying how you're helping him.

2085
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,560
There's another team, there's another team.

2086
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:44,880
White armor, white armor.

2087
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,000
You're literally white armor.

2088
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:51,800
On me.

2089
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:55,880
Knocked one of them.

2090
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:59,060
Alright, you guys win your ones.

2091
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:02,060
Last one.

2092
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,780
Who hasn't won their ones yet?

2093
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,520
I'll P20.

2094
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:08,600
See?

2095
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:10,420
That's so easy.

2096
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,820
We're going to be out of silver in no time, guys.

2097
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:15,940
Yeah.

2098
01:12:16,220 --> 01:12:18,280
Oh my god, it's going to be my first time in silver.

2099
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:21,100
Thanks guys for boosting me.

2100
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:22,300
Yeah.

2101
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:25,980
No.

2102
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:26,860
No.

2103
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:29,200
Damn.

2104
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,640
RPO is a booster, you guys.

2105
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:33,680
RPO is a booster, you guys.

2106
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:36,240
You think that offends me or something?

2107
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:49,200
By the way, I just realized there's a bug with P20 By the way, I just realized there's a bug with P20 where I had two P20s, but only one where I had two P20s, but only one was being held in my hand.

2108
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:50,820
So I was only shooting one P20.

2109
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:55,740
Oh, so you did the thing where you just swap it back to one.

2110
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,060
No.

2111
01:12:59,120 --> 01:12:59,520
Yeah.

2112
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,300
You can't just swap it back to one.

2113
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:01,740
Yes, you can.

2114
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,600
If you press B, it's one gun.

2115
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:06,760
No.

2116
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,640
Yes, it is.

2117
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:08,540
Where's your red armor?

2118
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:10,260
What do you mean?

2119
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:15,220
It was a bug with the fucking car.

2120
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:19,400
Where if you take the car, when you get off the car, you have only one gun in your hand for some reason.

2121
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,160
Oh, that's weird.

2122
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,740
I know you guys can swap it, but that's not what I did, motherfuckers.

2123
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:26,400
Hit him?

2124
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,900
Guys, we should kill that drone that's just flying around.

2125
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:33,960
There's a guy that's just looking at...

2126
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:34,940
Oh no, that's just a...

2127
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:36,580
Magnum right there.

2128
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:38,140
What is that guy doing on Pornhub?

2129
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,760
Go, Restia, go!

2130
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,220
Go, Restia!

2131
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:45,540
You got this!

2132
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:47,920
I missed every shot, by the way, but you got it.

2133
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:48,620
Yeah, we know.

2134
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:51,680
You were shooting him too.

2135
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:52,640
It wasn't just me.

2136
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,500
Yeah, but I didn't miss.

2137
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:55,440
Yes, you did.

2138
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,640
Oh, what?

2139
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,560
I literally didn't...

2140
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,060
Can you hit a bullet?

2141
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,080
I wasn't even shooting.

2142
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:08,720
There we go.

2143
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:12,160
Well, where's his teammate?

2144
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:13,600
Healing on the right.

2145
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,620
Alright, doing a finisher.

2146
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:18,680
No, he full on left them.

2147
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,420
These guys protected him, but he just left them.

2148
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,900
Restia, are you safe over there?

2149
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,600
Yeah.

2150
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,040
See, I cared about how he was doing.

2151
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,060
Oh, yeah.

2152
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:34,460
Sorry, because our full HP teammate was in so much danger.

2153
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:38,360
He could have had three people suddenly show up.

2154
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:43,380
You're literally the guy in school after you bully a guy, are you okay?

2155
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,700
Just kicked his ass and then asked me if he was okay.

2156
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:50,720
Are you okay, man?

2157
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,260
It didn't hurt that much, right?

2158
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:57,820
I didn't put him in the hospital.

2159
01:14:58,580 --> 01:14:59,780
I gotta make sure.

2160
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,720
I gotta make sure I'm not liable illegally.

2161
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,750
Hey, I'm kill leader.

2162
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:12,670
How the fuck did that happen?

2163
01:15:13,070 --> 01:15:13,610
I don't know.

2164
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:15,490
Somebody wasn't shooting your gun, I guess.

2165
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:18,830
No, someone's been KSing.

2166
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,150
10 assist boys.

2167
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,790
Wait, how many assists do you have, RPR?

2168
01:15:26,970 --> 01:15:27,410
Five.

2169
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:28,530
Oh, okay.

2170
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,190
So I've been kill stealing from you.

2171
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:35,990
Where the fuck are the...

2172
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:37,270
Oh, wait, I can scan them.

2173
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:40,350
Oh, technically you can both scan.

2174
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:42,570
Go do your job, RPR.

2175
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:43,350
Yeah, but you should do it.

2176
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:45,350
Why should I do it?

2177
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,110
Because I'm not gonna do it.

2178
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:48,810
You're literally Pathfinder.

2179
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:50,730
Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

2180
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:53,670
I'm jumping.

2181
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,690
She did something useful.

2182
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:00,810
Oh shit, there's a red.

2183
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,730
Kill him then.

2184
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:03,570
He knows.

2185
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:07,990
Oh, look at that poor...

2186
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,210
Oh my god, that poor guy.

2187
01:16:09,810 --> 01:16:10,930
Wait, he fucking...

2188
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:12,350
He literally made...

2189
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:14,350
Okay, that's too much.

2190
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:19,370
I'm gonna go the other side and fucking wait for him there.

2191
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:21,890
I'm gonna go over there.

2192
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,650
Wait, do you need us over there, RPR?

2193
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:24,130
Are you fine?

2194
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:26,170
We should be fine.

2195
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:28,150
Alright, we're gonna kill this rat then.

2196
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:32,630
Hey, check with that pack.

2197
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,010
Oh, Kraber, get it!

2198
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:35,290
Get it, Aristea.

2199
01:16:37,070 --> 01:16:37,930
That's what I'm getting.

2200
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:40,470
I'm gonna help this GG.

2201
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:42,650
Where's that...

2202
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:45,210
Where is this...

2203
01:16:45,210 --> 01:16:45,930
Ash?

2204
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,730
He should be back here.

2205
01:16:50,290 --> 01:16:50,810
Right?

2206
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:53,810
Oh shit.

2207
01:16:54,270 --> 01:16:55,110
I don't know.

2208
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:56,090
He's on the map.

2209
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:57,990
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

2210
01:16:58,270 --> 01:17:00,470
He fucking surprised me!

2211
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:01,630
He's literally won!

2212
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,030
He's literally won!

2213
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:05,870
I'm coming now.

2214
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,070
He's healing.

2215
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:11,450
He shot first!

2216
01:17:11,650 --> 01:17:13,030
What was I supposed to do?

2217
01:17:14,570 --> 01:17:15,350
I don't know.

2218
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:15,910
Fucking win.

2219
01:17:16,690 --> 01:17:17,810
Bro, he shot first!

2220
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:18,730
He had the advantage!

2221
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:20,950
He had the advantage!

2222
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:22,970
Oh my god, she got full fend as well.

2223
01:17:23,350 --> 01:17:25,810
All I'm saying is I thought Aristea was with me.

2224
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:28,570
It's not Aristea's fault.

2225
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:30,750
It's not Aristea's fault?

2226
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:34,370
Aristea, you can't win with this woman.

2227
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:35,450
It's always gonna be your fault.

2228
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,470
You should never be on her side, ever.

2229
01:17:39,330 --> 01:17:40,070
Alright, nice.

2230
01:17:42,670 --> 01:17:43,650
Can't believe it.

2231
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:44,330
Wait, Aristea.

2232
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,530
Wait a minute.

2233
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:47,630
Wait a minute.

2234
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,350
Aristea, are you okay?

2235
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,530
Aristea, are you...

2236
01:17:52,950 --> 01:17:53,910
Oh, nice!

2237
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:54,350
Okay.

2238
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,310
That should be fine.

2239
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,070
That's fine.

2240
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,210
I gotta go.

2241
01:18:02,430 --> 01:18:04,070
I can't even grab my loot back.

2242
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:06,030
Bro, that guy fucked me up.

2243
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:10,910
It's okay.

2244
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:12,770
I still have my ult, weapon, and...

2245
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,270
I get scrabered and continues to stand still.

2246
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,360
Oh, Devotion.

2247
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,220
Where's that?

2248
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,080
Wait, I want that.

2249
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:28,820
Is that full team?

2250
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,440
Yes.

2251
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,700
Alright, you'll be fine, right?

2252
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:34,740
I'm waiting for this package.

2253
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,880
Because I don't have anything.

2254
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,360
Hey, they're sort of looking at you.

2255
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:42,240
Oh!

2256
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,720
I just dive in a wall.

2257
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,960
What the hell is that even possible?

2258
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:48,200
Oh, he's coming down.

2259
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:51,380
Alright, I'm gonna go BRB.

2260
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:52,040
You guys win this.

2261
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:52,540
What?

2262
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:55,640
You keep crawling!

2263
01:18:58,380 --> 01:18:58,860
Alright.

2264
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:00,300
Crawl to us!

2265
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:04,720
Okay.

2266
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,300
I'll throw you a jump pad.

2267
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,200
I think he tabbed out.

2268
01:19:13,980 --> 01:19:14,940
I'm pretty sure.

2269
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,000
Yeah.

2270
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,100
I think he's tabbed out.

2271
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:19,960
I'm gonna jump pad.

2272
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:20,740
We're gonna rez you.

2273
01:19:26,470 --> 01:19:27,050
Don't worry.

2274
01:19:27,170 --> 01:19:27,830
They're looking at me.

2275
01:19:27,890 --> 01:19:28,530
They're looking at me.

2276
01:19:28,550 --> 01:19:29,190
So, we'll be fine.

2277
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:32,070
Oh my god.

2278
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:33,030
What?

2279
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,810
What happened?

2280
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:38,710
What happened?

2281
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:42,490
I can't do fucking guard jump pad.

2282
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:47,060
Good to see you guys.

2283
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:52,360
Okay.

2284
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,680
I'm fucked, guys.

2285
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:56,900
Did you?

2286
01:19:56,940 --> 01:19:57,920
Okay, you have a jump pad.

2287
01:19:57,980 --> 01:19:58,280
That's good.

2288
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,360
Just take the jump pad if you can.

2289
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:01,280
I'm dead.

2290
01:20:02,340 --> 01:20:02,780
No!

2291
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,280
It should be easy.

2292
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:06,880
What do you mean I'm unfettered?

2293
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,000
Just hit all your shots.

2294
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:12,880
Oh my god.

2295
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:14,160
I don't even have anything.

2296
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:15,440
I don't have heals.

2297
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,840
I didn't get to loot.

2298
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:20,580
Oh my god.

2299
01:20:20,580 --> 01:20:21,180
Guys, guys.

2300
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:22,480
Why did you put me in this situation?

2301
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,860
This is my last shield cell.

2302
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:26,480
This is literally my last shield cell.

2303
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:27,740
Why are you not pushing me?

2304
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:32,280
You know what?

2305
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:34,440
No!

2306
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:38,100
I can't see.

2307
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,980
I literally can't see.

2308
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:46,040
Okay, I blame RPR for that last ego push.

2309
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,100
Hit all your shots.

2310
01:20:52,240 --> 01:20:53,680
Just don't miss.

2311
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:54,640
It's that easy.

2312
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,400
Wait, I think he actually left left.

2313
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,340
He's not even...

2314
01:20:58,340 --> 01:21:00,000
He went to a bathroom.

2315
01:21:01,180 --> 01:21:02,680
He really left.

2316
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:06,600
Guys, if we won that game, I would have been silver, guys.

2317
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,440
That's all I'm saying.

2318
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:10,240
Yeah,

2319
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:17,780
if we get blamed for smurfing, it's RPR's fault.

2320
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:21,180
We didn't want to be in this elo.

2321
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,880
We wanted to play plat.

2322
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,020
Lobbies.

2323
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,000
We wanted to be in plat lobbies.

2324
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:36,880
But RPR insisted on fighting against bronze players because he wants to feel good about himself.

2325
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:40,220
Right, Restio?

2326
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,720
Yeah.

2327
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,140
You still remember if anything happens?

2328
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:47,880
That's true.

2329
01:21:47,940 --> 01:21:48,820
It's RPR's fault.

2330
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:49,080
Yeah.

2331
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:49,720
It's true.

2332
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:51,420
It's true.

2333
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:55,660
And he blamed me for starting that when you're the one that invented it.

2334
01:21:57,540 --> 01:21:58,640
Yeah, that's true.

2335
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,820
He blamed me.

2336
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:04,440
Even though you're the one that fucking invented the whole RPR's fault.

2337
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,680
Well, RPR's late.

2338
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,760
It's definitely his fault.

2339
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:10,260
Exactly.

2340
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,260
I 100% agree with you.

2341
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:18,060
I want to play here.

2342
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,220
I'm gonna go...

2343
01:22:24,860 --> 01:22:26,500
I'll definitely go with Tracer.

2344
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,200
Yeah, that's basically...

2345
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:32,180
Yeah, true.

2346
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,160
True.

2347
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:35,980
I haven't played Horizon in a long time.

2348
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,840
She actually looks like Tracer.

2349
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:40,680
Tracer, but Irish.

2350
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,300
Or Scottish?

2351
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,560
No, she's Scottish, right?

2352
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,440
I don't remember.

2353
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:46,820
I think Scottish, yeah.

2354
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,280
It's been so long.

2355
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,400
Wait, this guy is not back.

2356
01:22:53,660 --> 01:22:54,460
No, I don't think so.

2357
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,700
Like, what the fuck is he doing?

2358
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:56,420
Is he in the bathroom?

2359
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,580
Did he have like a stomach ache or some shit?

2360
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:01,520
Hello, RPR?

2361
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:01,960
RPR!

2362
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,760
Okay, why don't we both just solo launch and then leave him?

2363
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:08,100
And then break this guy, yeah.

2364
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:09,260
Where do we land?

2365
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,060
We're landing here.

2366
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:12,960
Okay, let's go.

2367
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:14,040
Goodbye, RPR.

2368
01:23:15,820 --> 01:23:16,340
It's okay.

2369
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,040
If we both die, we'll just watch this.

2370
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:19,440
Watch this.

2371
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:23,100
He literally left.

2372
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:27,060
He literally, so he was purposely feeding.

2373
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,280
No, you're not.

2374
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,980
What is wrong with you guys?

2375
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:31,720
What do you mean?

2376
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,660
It literally automatically gave it to you.

2377
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:37,040
You gave it to me 100%.

2378
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,660
We didn't give jack shit.

2379
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:39,600
You automatically got it.

2380
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:42,220
I should not have jump master.

2381
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:43,620
And you lying.

2382
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:46,100
Okay, Rustia, back me up here.

2383
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,100
Back me up.

2384
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,560
You back her up.

2385
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,520
We're not friends anymore.

2386
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,200
Oh my god.

2387
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,640
Rustia, who do you want as a friend?

2388
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:55,120
Me or RPR?

2389
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,080
You're gonna see me in Japan.

2390
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:00,180
You won't see her in there.

2391
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:04,880
Okay, don't worry, Rustia.

2392
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:05,720
I'm coming over to help you.

2393
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:08,580
Don't worry.

2394
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:10,700
Who do you trust more?

2395
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:16,020
You know, the one that was AFK couldn't help you or the one that wasn't AFK still didn't help you?

2396
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:17,600
I had to get a gun.

2397
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:18,420
I had to get a gun.

2398
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:19,840
That's all I can say.

2399
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,800
I didn't have a gun.

2400
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,640
No, there wasn't.

2401
01:24:23,640 --> 01:24:24,200
Now there is.

2402
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:26,540
Oh my god!

2403
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:27,780
Okay.

2404
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:31,460
I think I might be dead.

2405
01:24:33,240 --> 01:24:33,980
You're fine.

2406
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:37,220
You're not fine.

2407
01:24:37,460 --> 01:24:37,800
Fuck!

2408
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,180
Why are there people here?

2409
01:24:40,340 --> 01:24:41,420
Why are they there?

2410
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,140
Why are they there?

2411
01:24:45,140 --> 01:24:45,240
Why are they there?

2412
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,160
All I'm gonna say is I knocked you.

2413
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:53,100
All I'm saying is where the fuck...

2414
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:57,000
All I'm saying is that I got fucking...

2415
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,580
I got fucking ran out by three different people.

2416
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:00,980
I couldn't even shoot my gun at that point.

2417
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,360
Three people just showed up.

2418
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,660
All I'm saying is that if RPR landed with us, this wouldn't have happened.

2419
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:09,760
Rustia wouldn't have died.

2420
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:14,420
Only the person...

2421
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:20,540
If only the person that landed with Rustia actually fought with Rustia, that would have been great.

2422
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,120
I did not get a gun.

2423
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:26,340
So I had to run to a place with a gun.

2424
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,380
That POI is massive.

2425
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:29,080
No, no, no.

2426
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:31,200
That POI is not big enough.

2427
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:32,480
There were like five teams.

2428
01:25:33,820 --> 01:25:36,220
You gave me Jump Master while I was AFK.

2429
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:39,080
We did not give you Jump Master.

2430
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,080
That's not true.

2431
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,980
You gave me Jump Master while I was AFK.

2432
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:44,420
We did not give you Jump Master.

2433
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:45,520
No way.

2434
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:49,640
He needed you.

2435
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:53,820
It's RPR's fault and Doki is lying.

2436
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,800
What is true and it's not the part about me.

2437
01:26:01,240 --> 01:26:03,360
I'd never die on the internet, guys.

2438
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:05,240
That's a sin.

2439
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,260
That's a sin and I'm not a sinner.

2440
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:09,320
You're definitely a sinner.

2441
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,700
You will go to hell.

2442
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:15,740
Then I'll meet you there.

2443
01:26:17,020 --> 01:26:18,260
Then I'll meet you there.

2444
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,020
I'm going there.

2445
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:23,580
You'll be there first.

2446
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,140
Or you'll welcome me to hell.

2447
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,420
That phrase was so powerful.

2448
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,180
That phrase was so powerful.

2449
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,280
You're going to hell.

2450
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:33,500
You're going to hell.

2451
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,480
I'm volunteering to go first.

2452
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:36,940
I'm volunteering to go first.

2453
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:41,020
How is there no gun in this game?

2454
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:41,300
I lost it.

2455
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:43,840
You should back.

2456
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:46,780
I don't do boxing.

2457
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:48,460
Oh, wait, what the fuck?

2458
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:48,800
I'm fucking.

2459
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:49,400
Oh, I forgot.

2460
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,320
I'm a mad Maggie.

2461
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:52,900
Mad Maggie.

2462
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,600
I don't know why.

2463
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:57,380
This guy is just a goat.

2464
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:59,060
How did you die?

2465
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:02,540
I don't know because maybe I don't have a gun.

2466
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,520
There's like five guys.

2467
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,700
Oh, yeah, yeah, like how I didn't have a gun either.

2468
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,980
Yeah, but the POI is soooo big.

2469
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,160
Whoa, that was such a big POI.

2470
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,680
Lucky, what are you doing with that alternator?

2471
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,600
I'm freaking trying to heal, what do you mean?

2472
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:22,220
Oh, are you serious?

2473
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:28,400
What the fuck, there's two of them?!

2474
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,280
Why?!

2475
01:27:30,280 --> 01:27:33,780
This guy is literally not doing anything with his team.

2476
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:34,960
I remember getting to silver.

2477
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,840
He hit there in the corner.

2478
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:41,840
Holy shit.

2479
01:27:43,140 --> 01:27:47,300
Why he didn't do anything for his team, he literally just hit there in the corner.

2480
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,740
Why are you making fun of a silver player or a bronze player even worse?

2481
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:54,600
What do you mean?

2482
01:27:55,500 --> 01:28:00,260
I was saying he was in the corner just hiding there without helping his teammate until I fucking killed him.

2483
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:01,240
He fucking popped over.

2484
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:05,700
It's okay.

2485
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:06,740
It's because...

2486
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:07,580
It's okay.

2487
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:08,300
It's because...

2488
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:11,860
For some reason, our pair couldn't get a gun even though the POI is so big.

2489
01:28:13,620 --> 01:28:15,860
Someone really shit POI.

2490
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,100
Oh, you're blaming Restia.

2491
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:19,540
He was the gentleman.

2492
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,600
It was definitely you.

2493
01:28:22,140 --> 01:28:24,800
Like 500 houses there to get a...

2494
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,200
Yeah.

2495
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:27,220
Why did you land over there?

2496
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:32,480
Oh, no comment.

2497
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,340
Now, there's no comment because he knows he's wrong.

2498
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:43,880
I'm not wrong.

2499
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:46,180
I'm literally not wrong.

2500
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:49,060
You literally blame Restia for jump mastering.

2501
01:28:49,860 --> 01:28:51,940
Even though his jump mastering was okay.

2502
01:28:51,940 --> 01:28:54,920
I'm literally the only one here who can qualify as a pro player.

2503
01:28:55,020 --> 01:28:57,220
That makes me the most right here.

2504
01:28:57,220 --> 01:28:57,540
That's not true.

2505
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:00,360
Restia is also technically a pro because he...

2506
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:01,140
No, he's not.

2507
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,040
No, he's not.

2508
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:02,900
No, he's not.

2509
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:04,480
No, he's not.

2510
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:05,480
Technically, he is.

2511
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,520
No, he's not.

2512
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:07,540
He got...

2513
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:08,700
He got disqualified.

2514
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:10,540
He got disqualified for being a pro.

2515
01:29:10,540 --> 01:29:12,520
Yeah, but you played in one LGS event.

2516
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:17,340
If one LGS event makes you a pro, then everyone and their mom is a fucking pro player.

2517
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:22,180
Oh, so you don't respect Restia and his achievements.

2518
01:29:22,680 --> 01:29:23,020
No.

2519
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,760
I didn't say that.

2520
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,460
I just said he needs to be in the pro league.

2521
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:26,300
Whoa.

2522
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,800
To be a pro.

2523
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:29,300
It's okay.

2524
01:29:29,380 --> 01:29:31,000
You just get your ass carried by Krillix.

2525
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,740
You think that's like an insult or something?

2526
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:38,560
That's literally why I added him into the fucking team though, man.

2527
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:41,540
Restia, don't worry.

2528
01:29:41,620 --> 01:29:42,380
I'm handing over to you.

2529
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,480
RPR fucking left you, but I'm handing over.

2530
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:45,920
Oh, yeah.

2531
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,000
I'm just one shot, but I'll stay there.

2532
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:49,820
Don't worry.

2533
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:50,160
I'm here.

2534
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:51,300
Wait, what the fuck?

2535
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:53,100
Okay.

2536
01:29:56,820 --> 01:29:57,180
Saved.

2537
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,180
Damn.

2538
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,440
Wait, who's IGL in your team?

2539
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,460
You or Yuris?

2540
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:06,980
You're not going to let Yuris?

2541
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:10,320
Why would you use IGL?

2542
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:12,900
Cause isn't he IGL in his last team?

2543
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:14,800
Wait, they're rezzing?

2544
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,180
You think he enjoys OGLing?

2545
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,580
Fucking no.

2546
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:21,800
I never asked him if he enjoyed it.

2547
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:27,160
Yeah, literally every time it turned into their scrims, it's like RPR on the ground, RPR on the ground.

2548
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:27,640
Oh, my God.

2549
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:31,260
That is not even true.

2550
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:32,140
That happened once.

2551
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:34,760
Now, I know that you're just lying out of your ass.

2552
01:30:36,340 --> 01:30:38,660
Now, I just know that you're not even watching.

2553
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:47,700
Because there have been like hundreds of instances where I actually fucking did more damage and both of my fucking teammates are supposed to be carrying me.

2554
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:49,020
Oh, look at that.

2555
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:52,120
Arpio did not help us in this fight too, classic.

2556
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:53,820
I don't need to help you.

2557
01:30:55,140 --> 01:30:56,740
Why would you need help in Bronze?

2558
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:01,980
I don't know, because we're a team and we're supposed to fight as a team.

2559
01:31:02,260 --> 01:31:02,340
We're not a team.

2560
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:02,680
We're enemies.

2561
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,680
We're literally in the same party.

2562
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:05,660
We're literally enemies.

2563
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,020
That's fucked.

2564
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:09,040
That's so fucked.

2565
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:12,120
Oh, hey, Fireball.

2566
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:15,060
Okay, I haven't played Magnum in a long time.

2567
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:21,760
Why the fuck would you reuse IGL over me?

2568
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:22,580
What?

2569
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:25,260
I don't know, because your use is a decent IGL.

2570
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:26,960
I don't know.

2571
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:27,960
Oh, yeah, and I'm...

2572
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:31,080
Well, he's younger too, so...

2573
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,620
So what, just younger me because you're better at IGL?

2574
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,240
You're like fucking dumb.

2575
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,500
That's the best words I can find for you.

2576
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,160
You're dumb.

2577
01:31:49,060 --> 01:31:51,080
All I'm saying is that I don't know.

2578
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,440
Have you guys tried who's like the better IGL?

2579
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:55,300
I don't know.

2580
01:31:55,340 --> 01:32:01,240
Maybe because, you know, your use never even qualified for a LAN, and I've actually been fucking to every single LAN when I play professionally.

2581
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:01,960
IGL is gross.

2582
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,280
He's getting receipts.

2583
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:04,680
Damn, damn.

2584
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:05,420
Maybe just that.

2585
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:13,520
I mean, hey, if you're going to talk shit, you need to have, you know, results to back Wow, I didn't talk shit.

2586
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:14,740
I was just giving suggestions.

2587
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:15,220
Yes, you did.

2588
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:16,520
You literally did talk shit.

2589
01:32:16,520 --> 01:32:17,480
I was giving suggestions.

2590
01:32:18,720 --> 01:32:20,160
I wasn't talking shit like...

2591
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:20,960
Why would I take suggestions from you?

2592
01:32:21,060 --> 01:32:22,220
Ask yourself that.

2593
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:23,420
Why would you give me suggestions?

2594
01:32:23,420 --> 01:32:26,280
I'm just saying maybe give Yuris a chance.

2595
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:26,780
You died to Bronzies.

2596
01:32:27,020 --> 01:32:28,740
You died to Bronz too.

2597
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:33,240
You literally died more than me to Bronz players.

2598
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,560
You're saying give Yuris a chance like Yuris even wants to IGL.

2599
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:41,720
You don't know that, baby.

2600
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,460
People want IGL in this game.

2601
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:43,720
That's true.

2602
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,180
That's true.

2603
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,640
IGL is so fucking... a lot.

2604
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:53,840
Yeah, I saw your tone, IGL-ing Doki.

2605
01:32:54,120 --> 01:32:54,960
IGL-ing is too much.

2606
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,960
It's not fun at all.

2607
01:32:58,460 --> 01:33:00,860
It's fun for me because I know how to do it.

2608
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,660
Because maybe you just hate yourself.

2609
01:33:04,940 --> 01:33:06,980
No, it's just easy for me.

2610
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,460
All right.

2611
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,500
Let's see where you place in BLGS.

2612
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:15,480
You know, after 40 years of talking to his like grandchild.

2613
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:19,900
I was a Europe champion 50 years ago.

2614
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,440
Holy shit.

2615
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:24,280
You're so dumb.

2616
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:29,280
Damn.

2617
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,280
Apex champion.

2618
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,640
And you're a European champion 50 years ago.

2619
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:38,100
I did a lot more than just win one tournament.

2620
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:38,560
You know that.

2621
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:41,720
Damn.

2622
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:43,660
Really?

2623
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:44,180
Like what?

2624
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:50,840
I mean, you keep bragging about the EU LGS, but like, what about the others?

2625
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,260
I didn't even bring up the EU LGS.

2626
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:54,200
Yes, you did.

2627
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:55,960
You literally brought it up.

2628
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,500
I literally did not bring it up.

2629
01:33:58,500 --> 01:34:01,240
You brought it up to Rusty and saying that he's not a pro player.

2630
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:06,400
You were like Rusty is not a pro player because he didn't win an EU LGS like me.

2631
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:07,160
Of course he's not in pro league.

2632
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,900
You just fucking hear what you want to hear.

2633
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:14,340
I said he's not a pro player because he's not in the pro league.

2634
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:15,680
That's literally what I said.

2635
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:19,300
Never even brought up the fucking EU LGS in a championship.

2636
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:20,040
Whoa, shit.

2637
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:20,880
He died to a bronze.

2638
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,120
Like he actually brain dead.

2639
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:27,640
We're trying to save your life right now, RPR.

2640
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,380
You got to calm down.

2641
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:28,800
I don't give a fuck.

2642
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:29,420
Let me die.

2643
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:31,320
We're trying to save you.

2644
01:34:31,340 --> 01:34:32,740
Take the jump pad.

2645
01:34:32,820 --> 01:34:32,960
I'm not on your team anyway.

2646
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:34,880
Take the jump pad.

2647
01:34:34,900 --> 01:34:35,680
No, I'm taking it into them.

2648
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:37,100
What do you mean?

2649
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:38,900
Why did you fucking miss it?

2650
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,000
Oh my god.

2651
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:41,940
I don't want to get rushed by you.

2652
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:42,900
I'll play this team now.

2653
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:44,620
Oh my god.

2654
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,120
Bro, he's one.

2655
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,120
Oh, this is bad.

2656
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:48,500
Let's take one.

2657
01:34:48,920 --> 01:34:51,020
I'm fucking backing out because I need a heal.

2658
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:52,900
I need a Phoenix Kit.

2659
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:54,040
Is this one team or two?

2660
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:54,260
Two.

2661
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:55,860
Frisia?

2662
01:34:56,120 --> 01:34:56,440
Oh, my god.

2663
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:56,780
I'm in it.

2664
01:34:56,780 --> 01:34:57,260
Just one guy.

2665
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,440
You should go in there.

2666
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,120
It's just one guy.

2667
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,200
It's not one guy and you fucking know it.

2668
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,740
It is just one guy.

2669
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:04,660
Okay.

2670
01:35:06,120 --> 01:35:06,520
Okay.

2671
01:35:09,020 --> 01:35:11,720
Guys, I don't think this was one guy, guys.

2672
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:15,060
I don't think this was one guy, guys.

2673
01:35:16,640 --> 01:35:18,380
I didn't finish my party though.

2674
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:22,080
Like after like, I tried to talk to this great job.

2675
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:23,300
Oh.

2676
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:30,180
Champion, 50 years ago, his grandchild would be like, but grandpa, I heard your ass was carried by Mande.

2677
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:38,160
Yeah, because Mande did so great without me when he played LGS after.

2678
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,820
He makes more money as a content creator, so he doesn't care about LGS, right?

2679
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:52,240
So do I.

2680
01:35:53,900 --> 01:35:55,220
Why do you think I'm not playing?

2681
01:35:55,220 --> 01:35:56,840
No, you're playing BLGS.

2682
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,300
They're not playing in BLGS for money.

2683
01:36:02,620 --> 01:36:03,780
Because there isn't any.

2684
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,340
Wait, no, there is if you make it.

2685
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:07,860
I thought there was money, what?

2686
01:36:09,100 --> 01:36:10,920
Yeah, it's like 100k a region.

2687
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:13,600
There's like nothing when you split up on those teams.

2688
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:14,980
And they're amongst the players.

2689
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:20,080
Damn, so you're just doing this for pleasure and content.

2690
01:36:20,260 --> 01:36:21,900
What do you get for winning?

2691
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,640
Like, what do you get?

2692
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:30,680
If you win BLGS, I'm guessing first place gets like 30k or something.

2693
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:32,200
You get to be on Nice Wigs stream.

2694
01:36:35,440 --> 01:36:37,400
Yeah, but I'm telling you I'm not playing for money.

2695
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,280
You don't want to be on Nice Wigs stream?

2696
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:44,540
You started talking about money and I'm telling you I'm not playing for the money because you can't really win that much there.

2697
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:49,340
Yeah, but I didn't just say it's just money.

2698
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,920
I'm saying there's fame and exposure.

2699
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:55,040
What fame can I get from BLGS?

2700
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,680
I played in ALGS last.

2701
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:57,140
Nice Wigs!

2702
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:58,900
What fame can I get from BLGS?

2703
01:36:58,940 --> 01:36:59,720
Nice Wigs!

2704
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:02,280
What about Nice Wigs?

2705
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:03,900
And Restia is going to watch your stream.

2706
01:37:04,020 --> 01:37:05,780
He's going to watch part of your team.

2707
01:37:06,940 --> 01:37:08,140
Yeah, I'm going to see you rage.

2708
01:37:08,420 --> 01:37:08,860
Yeah.

2709
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,840
I never raged during comp and you should know this if you actually watched me play ever.

2710
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:17,140
Yeah, you never rage in comp.

2711
01:37:17,180 --> 01:37:18,100
You still complain though.

2712
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,440
What is this team doing?

2713
01:37:19,720 --> 01:37:21,100
What do you mean?

2714
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,720
I mean, if a stupid team does something stupid, you scream.

2715
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:25,600
They should be called out.

2716
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:28,180
Give us examples.

2717
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:31,580
Give us examples of your teammates being stupid if you are.

2718
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:33,400
I didn't say my teammates.

2719
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,440
I said the team.

2720
01:37:34,540 --> 01:37:37,720
If a team is stupid, you should call them out because they're never going to get better.

2721
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:40,780
Okay, then call us out.

2722
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:41,660
You don't call us out.

2723
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:42,900
Do you not want us to improve?

2724
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:44,240
I don't care if you get better though.

2725
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,340
Not even Restia?

2726
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:48,700
Restia doesn't need me.

2727
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:50,080
You hear that?

2728
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:52,240
Yep.

2729
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,420
Restia was an Overwatch pro.

2730
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:54,520
Why can't he get better by himself?

2731
01:37:57,960 --> 01:37:59,200
I saved your life.

2732
01:37:59,380 --> 01:37:59,800
You're welcome.

2733
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:01,660
You didn't.

2734
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,120
You literally are the only one who has armor cracked.

2735
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:05,460
You stole my kill.

2736
01:38:05,460 --> 01:38:08,640
I didn't even get hit once and you had armor cracked.

2737
01:38:10,060 --> 01:38:14,280
Maybe you should make sure you have cover too.

2738
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,720
Maybe you should get cover when you're trying to fight somebody.

2739
01:38:19,660 --> 01:38:20,780
How many kills did you get?

2740
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,340
I have two.

2741
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:24,800
Why is she lying all the time?

2742
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:25,660
I have two.

2743
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:26,380
I literally have two.

2744
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:28,880
I will stop and screenshot my kills right now.

2745
01:38:30,040 --> 01:38:31,780
Just open up my stream.

2746
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,780
Open up my stream right now.

2747
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:34,520
I'm not giving you a viewer.

2748
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,120
Open up my stream and give me a plus one viewership.

2749
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:38,020
I'm not giving you a viewer.

2750
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:38,820
I'm not giving you a viewer.

2751
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:43,180
RBS chat, open up my stream to confirm it for him and then you can say I'm right.

2752
01:38:44,740 --> 01:38:45,920
I'm not giving you a viewer.

2753
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,280
Yeah, but your chat's going to give me a viewer.

2754
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:48,840
Yeah.

2755
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:52,140
The funny part is that RBS chat's going to turn on him.

2756
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:55,420
My chat loves me now.

2757
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:56,600
We're in a different era.

2758
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:58,340
You're in a different era?

2759
01:38:59,100 --> 01:38:59,780
What happened?

2760
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,460
Yeah, we're different now.

2761
01:39:01,680 --> 01:39:02,180
What happened?

2762
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:03,960
There's actual character growth?

2763
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:04,300
I don't know.

2764
01:39:04,360 --> 01:39:07,820
Ever since I started playing BLGS, they love me now.

2765
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:08,440
I don't know what's happened.

2766
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:10,820
BLGS hasn't even started yet.

2767
01:39:11,740 --> 01:39:12,800
Yeah, we've been screaming.

2768
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:16,340
Yeah, because they love your recent Gryllix.

2769
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:19,780
No, they've been nice to me.

2770
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:20,200
I don't know why.

2771
01:39:21,620 --> 01:39:22,060
Really?

2772
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:22,820
Really?

2773
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:23,400
Chat's heart's beating.

2774
01:39:23,420 --> 01:39:25,040
Chat, you're spamming like old man RPR now.

2775
01:39:25,660 --> 01:39:28,000
It starts spamming RPR's vote.

2776
01:39:28,120 --> 01:39:29,520
Why do you think that insults me?

2777
01:39:34,980 --> 01:39:36,460
It proves our point.

2778
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:39,220
You're saying they respect you.

2779
01:39:39,300 --> 01:39:40,880
If they respect you, they won't spam it.

2780
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:43,520
If you tell chat to start spamming anything, they'll spam it.

2781
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,480
So your chat doesn't have free will?

2782
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:48,380
They can decide on their own.

2783
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:50,440
No, no, I said that.

2784
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:53,560
The streamer says, chat spam this.

2785
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:58,160
They always fucking do it in any fucking chat in any Twitch stream anywhere like what?

2786
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,340
No, that's not true.

2787
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:01,240
My chat didn't spam it because I didn't tell them to.

2788
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,560
I get it.

2789
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:05,660
Yeah, but if you told them they would, like are you dumb?

2790
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,880
Please choose to spam.

2791
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:13,480
It's the streamer's fault and our PR's fault.

2792
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:21,020
Wait, are you?

2793
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:24,160
He's literally older.

2794
01:40:24,360 --> 01:40:26,020
But I look younger.

2795
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:31,360
Okay, literally having a beard makes me a little older.

2796
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,500
You're also fucking Asian.

2797
01:40:36,540 --> 01:40:37,160
It doesn't count.

2798
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:37,780
Whoa!

2799
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,180
It doesn't count, dude.

2800
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:42,000
That's fucked.

2801
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:46,280
Wow, you pulled a race card.

2802
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,320
That's weird, bro.

2803
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,040
That's awkward.

2804
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:55,000
I wish you... sometimes I really wish you weren't dumb.

2805
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,240
I really wish.

2806
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,580
But it's just like, it's not gonna happen.

2807
01:40:59,640 --> 01:41:03,120
If I'm dumb, then why do people love watching me?

2808
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,280
Because... I'm not gonna say it.

2809
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:07,620
I'm not gonna insult your fanbase.

2810
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:09,960
Wow!

2811
01:41:09,960 --> 01:41:11,040
What are you gonna say, huh?

2812
01:41:11,420 --> 01:41:13,180
My fans are your fans, too.

2813
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:14,280
What are you gonna say?

2814
01:41:14,280 --> 01:41:14,900
They feel sorry for you.

2815
01:41:14,940 --> 01:41:15,760
That's why they watch you.

2816
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:18,040
They feel sorry?

2817
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,320
People love watching dumb people.

2818
01:41:22,060 --> 01:41:22,940
Okay, wait.

2819
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,380
That's true.

2820
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,120
That's why sometimes I watch RPR, too.

2821
01:41:27,460 --> 01:41:29,840
Why did you say I was... I zoned you out?

2822
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:34,320
It's okay.

2823
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:34,840
It's okay.

2824
01:41:34,900 --> 01:41:36,580
It's not... It doesn't matter to you.

2825
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,840
It literally doesn't.

2826
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:40,180
You're right.

2827
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:40,980
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

2828
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:41,500
Exactly.

2829
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:42,860
Exactly.

2830
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,600
Just be ignorant.

2831
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,960
That's why we love watching you.

2832
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,020
I bet your chat agrees with me that you're dumb.

2833
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:51,500
No, they don't.

2834
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:52,820
No, they don't.

2835
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:52,960
Let me check.

2836
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:53,500
No, they don't.

2837
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:54,160
Let me check.

2838
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,300
If you're a Doki viewer, come into my chat and tell me if you agree or not.

2839
01:41:57,620 --> 01:41:57,960
No, no.

2840
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:02,960
If you're a Doki viewer, do not go to his fucking chat.

2841
01:42:03,340 --> 01:42:07,900
If you're a Doki viewer, come into my chat and tell me if you agree if Doki is dumb or not.

2842
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:08,500
Wow!

2843
01:42:10,100 --> 01:42:13,260
Wait, I'm actually his model, so I'm gonna make a poll and...

2844
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:13,980
Oh, that's true!

2845
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:14,260
Yeah!

2846
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:15,340
Let's make a poll.

2847
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:17,300
Let's make a poll.

2848
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:18,640
Bro, yeah, I can make a poll, too.

2849
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,300
I can make a poll, too, on my own channel.

2850
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:26,420
Yeah, but Doki, everyone and their mom knows that your polls are rigged from day one whenever you make one.

2851
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:27,160
That is not true.

2852
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:28,640
Absolute rigged.

2853
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:29,900
How are they rigged?

2854
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,600
They're the same polls as a Twitch poll.

2855
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:36,060
It's just on a different platform.

2856
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:37,920
How are they rigged?

2857
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:39,220
You're the one that rigs them.

2858
01:42:39,340 --> 01:42:39,920
What are you on about?

2859
01:42:40,140 --> 01:42:41,020
Why do I rig it?

2860
01:42:41,860 --> 01:42:43,860
You always rig them.

2861
01:42:44,680 --> 01:42:49,540
I gotta say, Doki's in the lead on who's the number of polls, like 74%.

2862
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:55,400
Right now, it's 74% on Doki, 25% on RPR, and may I remind you...

2863
01:42:55,400 --> 01:42:55,780
That's not true.

2864
01:42:55,980 --> 01:42:56,080
You guys...

2865
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,100
...that my chat are all hate watchers.

2866
01:43:00,080 --> 01:43:01,960
And they're all still on my side.

2867
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:07,760
That's fucked, bro.

2868
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:09,300
That's your fucking chat.

2869
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:14,640
Yeah, but you know what my... You know that my chats are like...

2870
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:18,640
We had a VR chat group that was called Shinidachi, which was our name.

2871
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:20,580
We renamed it to RPR Hate Watchers.

2872
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:22,960
WOOOOOOAH This guy is the GOAT.

2873
01:43:23,320 --> 01:43:24,700
Up here, what the fuck happened?

2874
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:27,280
You can't let this happen in BLGS.

2875
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:30,000
Don't worry.

2876
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,060
Anyway, I'm winning this poll, so I don't care.

2877
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,040
Where is he?

2878
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:34,920
Where is the guy?

2879
01:43:34,920 --> 01:43:38,460
I am a dragoon, and Doki's definitely dumber, but that is why we love her.

2880
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:41,160
Are you gonna kill the guy that just knocked me?

2881
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:43,260
Or you just gonna pretend like...

2882
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:45,080
WOOOOOOAH WHAT THE FUCK?

2883
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:50,980
Wait, Restia's losing his- WHAT IS GOING ON RESTIA WHAT THE- I'm 100% sure about this.

2884
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,660
We're going to the lobby, dude.

2885
01:43:54,740 --> 01:43:56,180
I can't hear them.

2886
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,000
Behind you.

2887
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:01,680
What happened?

2888
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,460
This guy is a goat.

2889
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:05,140
You don't understand.

2890
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:06,840
Alright.

2891
01:44:07,820 --> 01:44:08,620
Where is he?

2892
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:10,180
Below me.

2893
01:44:10,580 --> 01:44:11,060
What?

2894
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,020
How did he get over here?

2895
01:44:15,340 --> 01:44:16,860
I'm telling you, this guy...

2896
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:19,800
I don't know what he ate this morning.

2897
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:24,260
I don't know what he ate this morning, but he is the goat of Mozambique.

2898
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:25,680
Maybe you should recruit him.

2899
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:27,820
Maybe he should be on your team.

2900
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:32,460
Might as well recruit him.

2901
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,960
I mean, he literally beat you and Restier, so you might as well be on your team, right?

2902
01:44:39,660 --> 01:44:41,600
Yeah, but you haven't seen Kralix, dude.

2903
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:43,180
Kralix would beat us both as well.

2904
01:44:43,460 --> 01:44:44,020
That's true.

2905
01:44:44,260 --> 01:44:45,380
He is younger too.

2906
01:44:47,500 --> 01:44:49,780
He has the reflexes to make up for it.

2907
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:51,500
You know, the rest of the team.

2908
01:44:54,460 --> 01:45:00,040
I have one guy singing in my team, one guy singing Filipino rap, and the other guy killing everyone.

2909
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:01,620
And I have to babysit both of them.

2910
01:45:01,700 --> 01:45:02,180
That's my team.

2911
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:04,220
That sounds fun.

2912
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:05,900
What's wrong with that?

2913
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:07,920
That sounds so fun.

2914
01:45:08,120 --> 01:45:12,920
Until you need to get them both to shut the fuck up and actually tell them what to do.

2915
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:14,760
Holy fuck.

2916
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:16,680
Those motherfuckers, when they start yapping...

2917
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:18,840
Yeah, we're training you for it.

2918
01:45:18,840 --> 01:45:20,820
Yeah, Restier and I are training for you.

2919
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:26,920
When Kralix starts on his fucking bullshit, dude, I need to fight him to fucking get awarded.

2920
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,540
Oh my god.

2921
01:45:30,580 --> 01:45:31,800
Hey guys, we're gonna be silver!

2922
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:33,520
It's crazy.

2923
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:33,600
Yeah!

2924
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:34,220
Let's go!

2925
01:45:34,840 --> 01:45:37,400
Also, my poll says they think you're dumb.

2926
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:38,940
You're dumber than me.

2927
01:45:40,780 --> 01:45:42,020
So, I don't know.

2928
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:44,760
Yeah, is RPR dumb?

2929
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:46,160
Yes or no is your poll.

2930
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,720
Yeah, but if they vote no, then that implies...

2931
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:55,660
Yeah, but why didn't you make the poll, who's dumber, RPR or Doki, and then see what happens?

2932
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:57,440
No, because I already...

2933
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,260
So, you rigged the poll again.

2934
01:45:58,260 --> 01:45:59,400
How did I rig the poll?

2935
01:45:59,420 --> 01:46:00,600
That was the answer.

2936
01:46:00,840 --> 01:46:02,560
That was literally the question.

2937
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:03,660
You rigged the poll again.

2938
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:04,620
How did I rig it?

2939
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:06,080
It just goes to show.

2940
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:08,840
It's called democracy right there.

2941
01:46:09,240 --> 01:46:10,200
Yes or no.

2942
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,200
A good question should be a yes or no question.

2943
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,240
That's a good question.

2944
01:46:15,240 --> 01:46:19,480
That only gives your chat the ability to say yes or no, nothing else.

2945
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:19,860
No opinion.

2946
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:22,040
I have an honest opinion.

2947
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:25,740
So, you should make a poll on is Doki dumb?

2948
01:46:25,800 --> 01:46:26,420
Yes or no?

2949
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:28,040
Yeah, do that.

2950
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:28,340
Do that.

2951
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,140
Make that poll.

2952
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:29,960
Alright, fine.

2953
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:30,600
I'll do it.

2954
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:32,220
Alright, make that poll.

2955
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:33,160
Yeah, I'm gonna do it.

2956
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,840
What are you doing?

2957
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:37,980
Why are you just standing there?

2958
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:39,580
Why are you just standing there, RPR?

2959
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,100
There's a team right in front of us.

2960
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,680
I'm waiting for your poll to appear in chat.

2961
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:45,760
Look at that.

2962
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:47,420
Not even a team player.

2963
01:46:47,660 --> 01:46:48,500
There's literally...

2964
01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,880
I'm literally waiting for... I'm not moving until there's a poll in your chat.

2965
01:46:52,140 --> 01:46:54,380
Oh, it's the fucking reset.

2966
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:54,960
Like what?

2967
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,400
That thing reset is...

2968
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,980
I'm not moving until you make a poll in your chat.

2969
01:46:58,980 --> 01:47:00,800
There's literally a team in front of Restia.

2970
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,580
We gotta help him and I'm a team player.

2971
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,480
Look at that.

2972
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:06,620
Good job, Restia.

2973
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:07,520
Don't I have a mod in your chat?

2974
01:47:07,640 --> 01:47:08,560
Maybe I can do a poll.

2975
01:47:08,600 --> 01:47:09,140
No, you don't.

2976
01:47:09,200 --> 01:47:10,920
Mods can't do polls in non-eat.

2977
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:12,940
YouTube sucks.

2978
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:14,100
This is why YouTube sucks us.

2979
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:16,280
I love YouTube.

2980
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:18,000
It doesn't mean that, guys.

2981
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:19,000
Oh my god!

2982
01:47:22,090 --> 01:47:24,650
Your entire chat is asking for this poll, by the way.

2983
01:47:24,770 --> 01:47:25,450
But they're not.

2984
01:47:26,770 --> 01:47:28,130
Don't speak from my chat.

2985
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:28,730
What the fuck?

2986
01:47:30,010 --> 01:47:31,470
I'm reading your chat right now.

2987
01:47:32,570 --> 01:47:33,350
I'm in a fight.

2988
01:47:33,510 --> 01:47:35,190
I can't... I can't see it.

2989
01:47:37,250 --> 01:47:39,430
Wait, there's a red... near us.

2990
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:44,770
What the fuck is this guy doing?

2991
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:50,170
He thinks we won't break the door just to kill him?

2992
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:53,130
Wait, there's a red next to us.

2993
01:47:56,130 --> 01:47:57,650
Ooh, there's Kraber.

2994
01:47:57,870 --> 01:47:58,310
Whoa!

2995
01:47:58,790 --> 01:47:59,470
Grab it!

2996
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:01,770
Okay, I'll take it then.

2997
01:48:02,250 --> 01:48:03,150
Oh, right here.

2998
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:06,750
There's a team right in front of me.

2999
01:48:06,850 --> 01:48:07,190
Whoa!

3000
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:08,590
It's a full team.

3001
01:48:10,310 --> 01:48:11,230
They're in this house.

3002
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:17,250
Oh, he's running.

3003
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:23,790
Got what?

3004
01:48:23,950 --> 01:48:24,150
Whoa!

3005
01:48:24,630 --> 01:48:26,290
Bro, chill, chill, chill.

3006
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:28,930
Here's a thing for you.

3007
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:32,810
You got... okay.

3008
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:33,350
Oh, 150.

3009
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:36,130
Where is he?

3010
01:48:36,290 --> 01:48:36,870
He's red.

3011
01:48:37,170 --> 01:48:37,890
Here, here, here.

3012
01:48:37,970 --> 01:48:38,330
He's low.

3013
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:39,690
Okay, I'm heading over.

3014
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:41,190
Don't worry.

3015
01:48:41,410 --> 01:48:42,050
I got you.

3016
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:43,450
Oh, he was low.

3017
01:48:44,030 --> 01:48:46,130
What is RPR doing?

3018
01:48:47,290 --> 01:48:49,270
He's actually looking at your pole.

3019
01:48:51,030 --> 01:48:52,210
I'm waiting for your pole.

3020
01:48:52,530 --> 01:48:54,630
I'm literally trying to save Rusty's life!

3021
01:48:56,010 --> 01:48:57,210
I already armor swapped it.

3022
01:48:57,250 --> 01:48:57,810
I don't know, actually.

3023
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:00,810
I know I knocked the other guy, so he has to heal.

3024
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,750
I hope, like, the zone kills him.

3025
01:49:10,290 --> 01:49:10,910
He's cracked.

3026
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:13,630
Wait, I got hit by another squad here.

3027
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:17,590
Damn, you really hate that guy.

3028
01:49:19,450 --> 01:49:19,930
Yep.

3029
01:49:19,930 --> 01:49:20,710
Waku waku.

3030
01:49:22,790 --> 01:49:27,650
I can't believe RPR would just throw... throw a game like that.

3031
01:49:28,530 --> 01:49:29,010
Wait.

3032
01:49:30,330 --> 01:49:31,510
He came from here.

3033
01:49:31,710 --> 01:49:32,470
Oh, he's there, yeah.

3034
01:49:32,790 --> 01:49:33,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3035
01:49:33,810 --> 01:49:34,230
Oh, yeah.

3036
01:49:34,330 --> 01:49:35,590
Rusty and I are good teammates.

3037
01:49:36,710 --> 01:49:37,670
We have...

3038
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:41,310
Wait, who are you shooting at?

3039
01:49:41,850 --> 01:49:42,330
Oh!

3040
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:46,830
I was like, wait a minute.

3041
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,550
Who am I shooting at then?

3042
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:51,710
Oh, we have a creeper.

3043
01:49:53,470 --> 01:49:57,870
Guys, look, we have the pole when we... when we kill this team.

3044
01:49:58,190 --> 01:50:01,330
RPR, if you wanna have a pole, you gotta come over here and help us kill this team.

3045
01:50:02,470 --> 01:50:03,790
No, I'm fighting a different team.

3046
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:04,730
No, you're not.

3047
01:50:04,730 --> 01:50:05,790
You're literally standing there.

3048
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:07,530
I can... I can see you...

3049
01:50:07,530 --> 01:50:08,490
I can fight while standing still.

3050
01:50:08,810 --> 01:50:11,170
I see you just standing there.

3051
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:12,910
I'm shooting.

3052
01:50:13,350 --> 01:50:14,150
Oh, my God.

3053
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:15,030
I missed every shot.

3054
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:16,910
It's fine.

3055
01:50:16,970 --> 01:50:19,330
I... I threw a ball at them.

3056
01:50:20,490 --> 01:50:21,430
Oh, I hit them.

3057
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:24,450
In this game, it's harder to shoot while you're standing still than when you're moving.

3058
01:50:24,730 --> 01:50:25,050
What?

3059
01:50:25,190 --> 01:50:25,250
What?

3060
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:27,250
Who told you that?

3061
01:50:29,210 --> 01:50:29,930
What do you mean?

3062
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:33,670
When you move, you have... you have less fucking recoil.

3063
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:38,210
There's like a mirage over here.

3064
01:50:38,310 --> 01:50:38,970
Oh, shit!

3065
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,270
Nice!

3066
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:43,050
Over here.

3067
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:44,630
Oh, wait, no.

3068
01:50:44,690 --> 01:50:45,310
That's a mirage.

3069
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,510
Oh, my gosh.

3070
01:50:48,350 --> 01:50:49,330
Where are they?

3071
01:50:50,990 --> 01:50:54,910
Surely two masters of red armor players can handle this.

3072
01:50:55,490 --> 01:50:57,550
Restia is not doing...

3073
01:50:57,550 --> 01:50:57,970
Oh, no!

3074
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:01,370
What the fuck?

3075
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:01,870
Okay!

3076
01:51:02,270 --> 01:51:02,950
Oh, okay.

3077
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:05,750
Hey, RPR, there... he's hiding.

3078
01:51:05,770 --> 01:51:06,310
So, what happened?

3079
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:07,550
So, what happened?

3080
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,110
Oh, I don't know.

3081
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:09,130
We had to 2v3.

3082
01:51:09,290 --> 01:51:09,690
I don't...

3083
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:15,030
I feel like you guys should be able to 2v3 in...

3084
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,110
I got flanked.

3085
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:18,390
Restia got flanked too.

3086
01:51:19,350 --> 01:51:21,230
In a fucking silver lobby.

3087
01:51:21,890 --> 01:51:23,670
Yeah, but a flank is a flank.

3088
01:51:24,070 --> 01:51:24,310
That's all.

3089
01:51:24,490 --> 01:51:25,290
You should 1v2 here.

3090
01:51:25,370 --> 01:51:26,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3091
01:51:26,050 --> 01:51:26,650
You're a master.

3092
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:28,070
You should be able to 1v2, right?

3093
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,390
You should be able to 1v2.

3094
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:29,730
Yeah, you should 1v2.

3095
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:30,430
Yeah.

3096
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:31,430
I got my 1.

3097
01:51:31,570 --> 01:51:33,410
But no, you guys didn't even get a 1.

3098
01:51:33,610 --> 01:51:34,150
What are we on about?

3099
01:51:34,230 --> 01:51:34,990
Yes, we did.

3100
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:35,590
They rez.

3101
01:51:36,210 --> 01:51:38,430
You guys didn't even kill a single guy.

3102
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:38,850
It's 3.

3103
01:51:39,070 --> 01:51:40,870
You guys are lying as well.

3104
01:51:41,390 --> 01:51:41,790
Wow.

3105
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:43,830
RPR.

3106
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:47,010
This is a silver lobby, RPR.

3107
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:47,950
I just watched the kill for the entire time.

3108
01:51:47,950 --> 01:51:50,130
Yes, I can't make a poll because he didn't help us.

3109
01:51:50,130 --> 01:51:50,210
You didn't kill a single person.

3110
01:51:50,450 --> 01:51:54,670
I did say I'll make the poll if he helps us with this team, but look at what happened.

3111
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:55,310
You didn't kill a single person.

3112
01:51:55,310 --> 01:51:55,550
You guys are so bad.

3113
01:51:55,550 --> 01:51:58,790
Remember, chat, this is RPR's fault for not helping us with the team.

3114
01:51:58,830 --> 01:51:59,390
You guys are bad.

3115
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:04,870
I was AFK for 30 minutes and I still almost had as much damage as you guys.

3116
01:52:04,990 --> 01:52:05,590
This is embarrassing.

3117
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:08,990
I don't know what you're talking about.

3118
01:52:09,250 --> 01:52:11,170
You literally can't even break 1k.

3119
01:52:11,310 --> 01:52:12,730
That's so fucking embarrassing.

3120
01:52:14,190 --> 01:52:18,470
You literally didn't even break 1k.

3121
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:21,090
I was standing still for three zones.

3122
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:22,990
Three zones.

3123
01:52:28,350 --> 01:52:32,790
You would have at least broken 1k before you stand still, but you still...

3124
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:35,810
That means you had even less damage when you got involved.

3125
01:52:37,130 --> 01:52:41,510
That means I had more damage than you because you guys were fighting like four teams while I was standing still.

3126
01:52:41,630 --> 01:52:42,690
That means you had 700 damage.

3127
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:42,950
One team.

3128
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:45,790
Doki grieved by not making the poll.

3129
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:46,370
Agreed.

3130
01:52:46,630 --> 01:52:48,350
We could have won that game if you made the poll.

3131
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:50,530
Like, we could have won the game if you made the poll.

3132
01:52:50,650 --> 01:52:51,650
All you have to do is make the poll.

3133
01:52:51,650 --> 01:52:57,170
Well, I said you gotta come over here and help us out and then I'll make the poll, but you didn't come over here, so that's your fault.

3134
01:52:57,450 --> 01:52:58,550
That's not how life works.

3135
01:52:58,570 --> 01:52:59,110
That was my condition.

3136
01:52:59,130 --> 01:53:00,470
You have to make the poll for me to move.

3137
01:53:00,710 --> 01:53:06,510
I'll make the poll because I am a humble person who is willing...

3138
01:53:06,510 --> 01:53:06,870
Sure you are.

3139
01:53:06,870 --> 01:53:07,690
...who is willing...

3140
01:53:08,450 --> 01:53:08,810
Yeah, yeah.

3141
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:09,210
...to be nice...

3142
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:10,290
You're definitely humble, very humble.

3143
01:53:10,410 --> 01:53:11,290
...to my chat.

3144
01:53:11,290 --> 01:53:11,870
Oh my god.

3145
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:14,430
Which I know RPR's chat doesn't have, never had that feeling before.

3146
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:17,350
Yeah, I'm just never actually learned from that.

3147
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:24,830
Cause I know, I know like RPR's chat, you guys never had that feeling before or like felt that?

3148
01:53:24,830 --> 01:53:29,450
Came over from Dokie stream, can't handle anti-democratic streamers.

3149
01:53:32,430 --> 01:53:33,370
Just saying.

3150
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:39,830
That's a message in my channel.

3151
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:48,090
76% on this DokiDom, yes.

3152
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:52,050
That means we're both dumb!

3153
01:53:52,170 --> 01:53:54,450
Because they think you're dumb too, RPR!

3154
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:56,930
Yeah, but in my chat...

3155
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:58,230
At least we're both dumb!

3156
01:53:59,370 --> 01:54:01,450
Yeah, but your chat's biased!

3157
01:54:02,650 --> 01:54:03,490
No, it's not.

3158
01:54:04,010 --> 01:54:06,830
If you know my chat, you know they're not biased.

3159
01:54:09,190 --> 01:54:10,810
I thought you said your chat...

3160
01:54:10,810 --> 01:54:12,830
I thought you said your chat is nice to you now!

3161
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:17,170
My chat is filled with hate watchers who vote against me.

3162
01:54:17,230 --> 01:54:17,930
You know something's wrong.

3163
01:54:20,050 --> 01:54:22,590
Oh, so now they're hate watchers.

3164
01:54:24,450 --> 01:54:26,510
Changing the fucking story!

3165
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:28,410
No, that's the point.

3166
01:54:28,490 --> 01:54:33,070
I was briefly in RPR's stream and never felt so unwelcome.

3167
01:54:33,170 --> 01:54:35,770
So comfy in Doki's stream!

3168
01:54:36,830 --> 01:54:36,970
Yeah!

3169
01:54:37,790 --> 01:54:39,110
Stay there then, motherfucker!

3170
01:54:40,590 --> 01:54:43,570
Also, thanks for the super chat, I really appreciate it!

3171
01:54:44,190 --> 01:54:45,250
Keep that guy, please!

3172
01:54:49,410 --> 01:54:52,390
You know which chat I feel the most comfy in?

3173
01:54:52,770 --> 01:54:53,570
Rusty's chat.

3174
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:56,150
Yep.

3175
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:58,290
There's a guy coming over to you.

3176
01:54:58,330 --> 01:54:59,830
There's a guy coming over to you right now.

3177
01:55:00,850 --> 01:55:03,250
I knocked an old man over there behind us.

3178
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:05,650
Nice.

3179
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:07,490
I warned you.

3180
01:55:08,670 --> 01:55:09,630
I'm a hero.

3181
01:55:10,830 --> 01:55:12,470
She's not a fucking hero.

3182
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:15,030
You know we're even close.

3183
01:55:15,530 --> 01:55:18,310
I literally gave Rusty an intel.

3184
01:55:20,610 --> 01:55:21,690
Yeah, but he killed him.

3185
01:55:21,850 --> 01:55:23,870
Yeah, but I gave him intel for it.

3186
01:55:25,970 --> 01:55:26,690
Like that.

3187
01:55:26,950 --> 01:55:28,150
We killed a team.

3188
01:55:28,150 --> 01:55:28,970
Backwards ass logic.

3189
01:55:29,310 --> 01:55:30,990
Oh, I'm getting shot at from here.

3190
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:33,490
Cracked him?

3191
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:38,380
Oh, I got you.

3192
01:55:38,860 --> 01:55:39,860
Go away, Rusty!

3193
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:41,600
What the hell?

3194
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:42,760
What the fuck?

3195
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:43,700
There's a guy behind me.

3196
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:44,200
What the hell?

3197
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:46,440
You got this.

3198
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:47,820
He's coming in, by the way.

3199
01:55:49,940 --> 01:55:50,480
Don't worry.

3200
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:52,740
I know that RP has got it.

3201
01:55:52,780 --> 01:55:53,580
Because I believe in him.

3202
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,110
No, you don't.

3203
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:58,910
Yes, I do.

3204
01:55:58,990 --> 01:56:00,090
I'm literally not heading over.

3205
01:56:00,090 --> 01:56:01,850
Just because of how much I believe in you.

3206
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:04,090
Wait, where are they?

3207
01:56:04,090 --> 01:56:04,350
Why are you lying?

3208
01:56:05,650 --> 01:56:06,470
It's one guy.

3209
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:09,750
It was not one guy.

3210
01:56:09,850 --> 01:56:10,790
Why are you lying?

3211
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:13,650
I saw one guy.

3212
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:16,270
You literally got Rusty and I killed!

3213
01:56:17,650 --> 01:56:18,410
Nah, you're stupid.

3214
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:20,190
They're both one, by the way.

3215
01:56:20,210 --> 01:56:21,330
They're literally both one.

3216
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:23,550
Oh my god.

3217
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:25,030
Oh my god.

3218
01:56:25,730 --> 01:56:27,130
That's so embarrassing.

3219
01:56:27,810 --> 01:56:28,270
Wow.

3220
01:56:29,330 --> 01:56:32,850
Just because I saw one guy doesn't mean there is one guy.

3221
01:56:34,090 --> 01:56:34,550
It's over now.

3222
01:56:34,690 --> 01:56:36,190
Alright, Rusty, let's go to plat.

3223
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:37,990
Let's go to plat lobby.

3224
01:56:39,770 --> 01:56:41,830
Oh man, plat lobby is going to be so cool.

3225
01:56:41,830 --> 01:56:43,350
How did RPR lose that?

3226
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:46,270
Rusty and I both got them one!

3227
01:56:51,970 --> 01:56:53,050
That's crazy.

3228
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,480
That's okay.

3229
01:56:58,640 --> 01:57:01,320
You know, RPR, it's okay.

3230
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:05,320
You know, years can do that to you.

3231
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:08,040
The older you get, the less...

3232
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:10,500
Why do you think I care?

3233
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:11,760
Do you really think I care?

3234
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:12,580
I don't care.

3235
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:13,760
I don't care we die.

3236
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:14,900
I don't care.

3237
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:16,360
Why are you so defensive?

3238
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:23,040
You don't have to do this team play shit.

3239
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:23,880
I don't care.

3240
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:25,260
But we're a team.

3241
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,420
I hope we die again in plat 2.

3242
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:30,860
At least you don't care.

3243
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,820
As long as you're suffering, I'm winning.

3244
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:37,080
Hold on.

3245
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:39,780
Watch the world burn.

3246
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:42,580
Damn.

3247
01:57:46,620 --> 01:57:47,100
Damn.

3248
01:57:47,180 --> 01:57:48,300
What happened to you?

3249
01:57:48,440 --> 01:57:50,000
When did you get so pessimistic?

3250
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:52,180
Pessimistic?

3251
01:57:52,780 --> 01:57:54,140
What is pessimistic?

3252
01:57:54,140 --> 01:57:54,980
I just don't want to win.

3253
01:57:56,220 --> 01:57:58,180
That's exactly what it is!

3254
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:59,260
What happened?

3255
01:58:01,140 --> 01:58:02,440
It's not pessimistic.

3256
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:03,500
I just don't want you to win.

3257
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:04,140
Why not?

3258
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:05,280
But we're a team.

3259
01:58:06,680 --> 01:58:07,660
We're not a team.

3260
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:10,020
We're a team.

3261
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,480
We are not a team.

3262
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:14,260
Rusty and I are a team.

3263
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:14,980
We are not a team.

3264
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,960
Yeah, and I'm not part of your team.

3265
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:19,120
What?

3266
01:58:19,160 --> 01:58:20,140
You don't like Rusty?

3267
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:22,100
Invite me, invite me.

3268
01:58:22,320 --> 01:58:22,720
Alright.

3269
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:25,820
Well, he's on your team, so that means he's against me.

3270
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:27,840
I'm not.

3271
01:58:28,420 --> 01:58:29,120
I'm like...

3272
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:32,340
I'm like in center of you guys.

3273
01:58:32,620 --> 01:58:33,060
What is that?

3274
01:58:34,060 --> 01:58:34,460
Shit.

3275
01:58:34,580 --> 01:58:35,620
Okay, I got you.

3276
01:58:35,620 --> 01:58:36,860
I invited you.

3277
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:37,640
Damn.

3278
01:58:39,060 --> 01:58:41,120
Yeah, this was Rusty's idea.

3279
01:58:41,160 --> 01:58:42,600
I was like, who should we get as a third?

3280
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:44,440
And Rusty has said, let's get RPR.

3281
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,140
Thank you so much, Rusty.

3282
01:58:47,140 --> 01:58:48,400
Yeah, he did this for you.

3283
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:51,340
I'm such...

3284
01:58:51,340 --> 01:58:51,860
Fucking asshole.

3285
01:58:51,940 --> 01:58:52,760
I'm such like...

3286
01:58:55,540 --> 01:58:56,340
Fucking RPR.

3287
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:00,540
What are you gonna play?

3288
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:01,300
Loba?

3289
01:59:01,920 --> 01:59:03,120
You're gonna play Loba and Plat?

3290
01:59:03,120 --> 01:59:05,320
First of all, what are you playing, Doki?

3291
01:59:05,460 --> 01:59:06,520
Oh wait, yeah, I'm not playing...

3292
01:59:07,360 --> 01:59:08,500
Now that we're in Plat.

3293
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:10,640
No, no.

3294
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:11,680
What do people play?

3295
01:59:11,740 --> 01:59:13,340
I don't even know what people play in rank.

3296
01:59:14,400 --> 01:59:15,360
What do they play?

3297
01:59:15,960 --> 01:59:16,360
Catalyst?

3298
01:59:16,740 --> 01:59:17,400
Oh, fucking no.

3299
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:18,420
Is Catalyst still good?

3300
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:21,680
I guess.

3301
01:59:22,980 --> 01:59:24,720
You're literally in BLGS.

3302
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:26,420
What do you play for your team?

3303
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:27,240
We're in rank.

3304
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:30,660
We're not gonna play rank like it's BLGS.

3305
01:59:30,700 --> 01:59:32,020
Yeah, okay, so what do you play in rank?

3306
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,780
What do you play in rank then?

3307
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,960
We play the same characters we play in BLGS.

3308
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,700
Yeah, exactly!

3309
01:59:39,620 --> 01:59:41,960
But we're warming up for scrims.

3310
01:59:41,960 --> 01:59:42,400
That's different.

3311
01:59:47,660 --> 01:59:49,620
You wanna play what we play in BLGS?

3312
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,020
We play Pathfinder, Newcastle, and Bangalore.

3313
01:59:52,440 --> 01:59:53,220
What the fuck is that comp?

3314
01:59:53,380 --> 01:59:55,680
What the fuck is that comp?

3315
01:59:55,680 --> 01:59:56,420
What do you mean, what's that comp?

3316
01:59:56,460 --> 01:59:57,020
It's like...

3317
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:58,480
Is that the new meta?

3318
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,980
Only Giga should split Pathfinder and comp.

3319
02:00:03,620 --> 02:00:05,040
Oh my god, that's...

3320
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:06,780
It's like, you know...

3321
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:11,540
You get like the bins reset, like in endzone, and Newcastle has the gold knock.

3322
02:00:11,680 --> 02:00:12,560
That's like super strong.

3323
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,300
Oh, I see.

3324
02:00:14,580 --> 02:00:15,900
Oh, I wanna try Newcastle then.

3325
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,820
Because you both trust in my Newcastle.

3326
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:20,400
No, I'll play it.

3327
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:21,460
Why not?

3328
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,740
I just had a premonition.

3329
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:28,420
What happened?

3330
02:00:28,740 --> 02:00:29,540
What did you have?

3331
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:30,540
It just wasn't good.

3332
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:37,090
I'm gonna find One Piece.

3333
02:00:37,570 --> 02:00:39,010
You know that they never...

3334
02:00:39,010 --> 02:00:42,390
They copied this One Piece skin, and they never created One Piece.

3335
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:44,370
I know about it.

3336
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:47,130
Everybody know it's a One Piece skin, but they...

3337
02:00:47,130 --> 02:00:49,290
It's a fucking Luffy skin, and they just...

3338
02:00:49,290 --> 02:00:50,910
Yeah, they yoinked it, and they were like...

3339
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:52,350
He's just a pirate with a hat.

3340
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:54,870
He's just wearing a hat.

3341
02:00:55,970 --> 02:00:58,770
I wonder why One Piece didn't sue them yet.

3342
02:00:58,830 --> 02:00:59,590
I feel like they should.

3343
02:01:00,890 --> 02:01:03,050
You know like the Demon Slayer stuff?

3344
02:01:03,050 --> 02:01:04,390
And then they have like the...

3345
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:05,710
Like the clothes.

3346
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,990
Really?

3347
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:09,090
For which one?

3348
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:10,850
I mean like...

3349
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:15,970
There's so many goods that's related to the squares, but it's actually not a...

3350
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:17,030
Not a collab.

3351
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:19,390
That's funny.

3352
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:28,210
They've copied so many things from anime, and I really feel like the anime industry should just all gather up and start suing Apex Legends.

3353
02:01:28,770 --> 02:01:30,070
Burn them to the ground.

3354
02:01:32,110 --> 02:01:33,730
Watch the world burn.

3355
02:01:34,250 --> 02:01:37,750
His opinion does not reflect this team's by the way.

3356
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:41,150
I mean they deserve it.

3357
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:42,450
It's literally against copyright.

3358
02:01:43,350 --> 02:01:45,910
Our fear does not reflect the rest.

3359
02:01:45,910 --> 02:01:49,390
Rusty and I, by the way, we love Apex.

3360
02:01:51,090 --> 02:01:54,550
We don't see any comparison between the two.

3361
02:01:55,310 --> 02:01:56,390
Of course you don't.

3362
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:57,890
Of course not.

3363
02:01:57,970 --> 02:01:59,030
I love Apex.

3364
02:02:01,210 --> 02:02:02,650
There's like people in front of me fighting.

3365
02:02:03,030 --> 02:02:06,730
Oh wait, I fucking was using my mask if I didn't even see that.

3366
02:02:07,030 --> 02:02:09,070
On you.

3367
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:12,050
He's literally looking at this team.

3368
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:17,160
Oh shit, what the fuck?

3369
02:02:18,300 --> 02:02:19,100
You've run away.

3370
02:02:19,440 --> 02:02:20,340
What is wrong with you?

3371
02:02:20,380 --> 02:02:20,600
Yeah, he's cracked.

3372
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:26,360
This guy's flesh.

3373
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:29,500
I put a nade in there.

3374
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:30,660
I'm heading over.

3375
02:02:31,920 --> 02:02:33,060
Alright, go RPR, go.

3376
02:02:33,740 --> 02:02:34,260
Last one?

3377
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:35,780
This one's in the corner.

3378
02:02:36,680 --> 02:02:37,960
It's okay, you can rez him.

3379
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:40,380
I know what I can do.

3380
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:41,680
Whoa.

3381
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:48,360
This is your warming up for your scrims.

3382
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,260
I don't play Newcastle.

3383
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:52,300
Then why are you playing...

3384
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:53,280
Then why are you playing...

3385
02:02:53,700 --> 02:02:55,540
Because I don't trust you with Newcastle.

3386
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:56,260
Why don't you trust me?

3387
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:57,060
You don't know that.

3388
02:02:57,880 --> 02:03:00,040
Do I have to elaborate that or what?

3389
02:03:00,300 --> 02:03:00,660
What?

3390
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:01,260
Yes.

3391
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:03,820
I feel like I'm a very trustworthy person.

3392
02:03:04,940 --> 02:03:06,020
You feel wrong.

3393
02:03:07,280 --> 02:03:08,820
Why are you backing me?

3394
02:03:08,860 --> 02:03:10,000
Why did you laugh at that?

3395
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:11,380
I thought you were on my side.

3396
02:03:13,500 --> 02:03:14,700
I'm the balance, you know.

3397
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:15,920
You're the balance.

3398
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,180
Okay, okay.

3399
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:21,960
You are dangling from the cliff, Restia.

3400
02:03:22,060 --> 02:03:23,680
And it's either me or...

3401
02:03:25,300 --> 02:03:28,700
It's either me or RPR that saves your life.

3402
02:03:28,720 --> 02:03:28,780
It's either me or RPR that saves your life.

3403
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:31,220
Who do you trust to save your life?

3404
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:34,320
Of course I would save your life before you.

3405
02:03:35,240 --> 02:03:35,640
Of course I would save your life before you.

3406
02:03:35,640 --> 02:03:36,760
You mean of course you.

3407
02:03:39,680 --> 02:03:41,320
What's that supposed to fucking mean?

3408
02:03:41,380 --> 02:03:42,020
I'm going to look at...

3409
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:43,540
Can you fucking kill this guy?

3410
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:45,720
I was looking at the guy I was getting rezzed.

3411
02:03:46,800 --> 02:03:47,700
Restia, what happened?

3412
02:03:49,700 --> 02:03:50,580
Oh my god.

3413
02:03:50,740 --> 02:03:51,340
These two are both rezzed.

3414
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:52,200
They should be broke.

3415
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:55,520
I am trying to combat...

3416
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:55,960
Look, I have a charge rifle.

3417
02:03:56,080 --> 02:03:56,820
We're good, we're good.

3418
02:03:57,780 --> 02:03:58,180
Alright.

3419
02:03:58,180 --> 02:03:58,440
Alright.

3420
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:01,480
I'm holding this door.

3421
02:04:02,820 --> 02:04:03,300
Okay.

3422
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:05,980
What happened to the door?

3423
02:04:06,100 --> 02:04:07,060
He's a charge rifle.

3424
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,840
He's trying to punch.

3425
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:09,380
He has nothing.

3426
02:04:09,780 --> 02:04:11,460
No, but he's a liar.

3427
02:04:11,600 --> 02:04:14,280
He has a gun and a charge rifle.

3428
02:04:14,620 --> 02:04:16,080
You're fucking lying.

3429
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:18,200
You are such a...

3430
02:04:18,200 --> 02:04:18,920
I have a charge rifle.

3431
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:19,600
What are you on about?

3432
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:21,540
He shot...

3433
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:22,940
You want to know who he shot me with?

3434
02:04:23,100 --> 02:04:25,600
He shot me with a fucking...

3435
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:27,580
He has a 301 and a charge rifle.

3436
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:28,160
What are you on about?

3437
02:04:28,180 --> 02:04:29,920
He was like, he has a charge rifle.

3438
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:30,740
Just go...

3439
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:34,280
45 and RE.

3440
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,320
He has nothing.

3441
02:04:37,780 --> 02:04:39,200
What's your damage, dude?

3442
02:04:39,460 --> 02:04:40,560
What are you doing?

3443
02:04:41,620 --> 02:04:42,580
Who rezzed you?

3444
02:04:44,240 --> 02:04:46,440
You're like baiting me.

3445
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:47,840
Yeah, you baited him.

3446
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:48,880
I'm baiting you.

3447
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:50,560
You literally baited...

3448
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:54,300
He baited me and Restia.

3449
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:55,680
He literally said he has nothing.

3450
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:57,580
He just has a charge rifle.

3451
02:04:58,180 --> 02:05:00,280
Thank you for revealing how toxic Doc is.

3452
02:05:00,400 --> 02:05:01,120
First time shot her.

3453
02:05:05,680 --> 02:05:06,940
I'm not even doing anything.

3454
02:05:07,100 --> 02:05:08,280
She's just self-exposing.

3455
02:05:10,080 --> 02:05:11,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

3456
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:13,080
I'm the most trustworthy person out there.

3457
02:05:13,220 --> 02:05:13,880
In this group.

3458
02:05:14,160 --> 02:05:14,800
Actually, no.

3459
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:15,980
Actually...

3460
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:18,660
Not even...

3461
02:05:19,340 --> 02:05:21,440
Cause I trust Restia more.

3462
02:05:21,620 --> 02:05:23,700
Cause I trust Restia more.

3463
02:05:23,760 --> 02:05:24,540
Cause he's a cat.

3464
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:29,860
You're not even the most trustworthy person if you were alone by yourself in a lobby.

3465
02:05:30,040 --> 02:05:31,040
That's not true.

3466
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,440
I'm more trustworthy than you.

3467
02:05:34,540 --> 02:05:36,300
We both know that's not true.

3468
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,600
I said...

3469
02:05:38,540 --> 02:05:40,580
Restia, you're about to die.

3470
02:05:40,660 --> 02:05:42,180
But only one of us can save you.

3471
02:05:42,260 --> 02:05:42,920
Who would you pick?

3472
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:45,540
Probably let me die.

3473
02:05:47,300 --> 02:05:48,080
Look at that.

3474
02:05:48,240 --> 02:05:50,080
He doesn't even trust you, RPR.

3475
02:05:52,180 --> 02:05:53,580
He knows I would save him.

3476
02:05:55,880 --> 02:05:56,800
He knows I would save him.

3477
02:05:56,800 --> 02:05:57,260
Do you?

3478
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:01,640
Do you, Restia?

3479
02:06:01,760 --> 02:06:02,800
Do you, Restia?

3480
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:04,840
No, we actually have like...

3481
02:06:04,840 --> 02:06:06,500
I always have a question.

3482
02:06:06,740 --> 02:06:09,820
If your girlfriend, your mom, falls into the water.

3483
02:06:09,980 --> 02:06:11,880
Into the sea, who would you save?

3484
02:06:12,340 --> 02:06:13,540
Yeah, who would you save?

3485
02:06:13,660 --> 02:06:15,580
I don't have a girlfriend so I'd save my mom.

3486
02:06:18,200 --> 02:06:19,100
No, it's like...

3487
02:06:20,080 --> 02:06:21,080
Restia and I...

3488
02:06:21,080 --> 02:06:21,680
Next.

3489
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:23,480
Oh, next?

3490
02:06:23,720 --> 02:06:23,880
Okay.

3491
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:26,920
He's not even gonna...

3492
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:27,820
Look at that, Restia.

3493
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,800
He's not even gonna save you.

3494
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:32,660
Yeah, he's probably just gonna watch us like...

3495
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:34,360
He's just gonna watch us drown.

3496
02:06:34,460 --> 02:06:35,780
What was the question?

3497
02:06:35,980 --> 02:06:36,360
I was like...

3498
02:06:36,360 --> 02:06:39,180
If Restia and I are both drowning in the water.

3499
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:41,200
In the ocean.

3500
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:50,440
Okay, if Restia in your chat is drowning in the water.

3501
02:06:50,600 --> 02:06:51,580
Who would you save?

3502
02:06:52,600 --> 02:06:54,600
You're gonna save your entire chat collectively.

3503
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:56,340
Or just Restia.

3504
02:06:56,360 --> 02:06:58,540
If I save chat, that's more than one people.

3505
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:00,240
I would save more lives if I save chat.

3506
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:00,980
So I'm saving chat.

3507
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:03,780
Despite what Restia did for you?

3508
02:07:05,460 --> 02:07:07,120
What about what my chat did for me?

3509
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:08,780
I mean, but...

3510
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:10,320
Isn't Restia a bro?

3511
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:12,380
Yeah, okay.

3512
02:07:12,440 --> 02:07:13,300
But what about my chat?

3513
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:13,900
I have like...

3514
02:07:14,620 --> 02:07:15,760
Thousands of bros then.

3515
02:07:16,360 --> 02:07:16,880
Whoa!

3516
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:18,860
Restia...

3517
02:07:18,860 --> 02:07:22,520
I'm just going by the amount of people I would save.

3518
02:07:22,580 --> 02:07:24,340
I would save more people if I save chat.

3519
02:07:25,180 --> 02:07:29,660
Or I could sacrifice my entire chat for the life of a single person.

3520
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:31,440
Yeah, but he might be...

3521
02:07:31,440 --> 02:07:33,120
Restia wouldn't even want...

3522
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:36,960
Restia wouldn't even want me to save him over hundreds of people.

3523
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:38,720
Restia, do you want him to save you?

3524
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:45,740
What if Croatia and the United States of America is both drowning in the water?

3525
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,420
I'm saving Croatia every single time without fucking blinking.

3526
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:53,320
Yeah, but like, the United States have more people, more population.

3527
02:07:53,740 --> 02:07:54,420
Yeah, but...

3528
02:07:54,420 --> 02:07:55,960
But it's the United States.

3529
02:07:56,680 --> 02:07:58,700
Your logic doesn't make sense!

3530
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:01,160
Your logic doesn't make sense!

3531
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,120
Yeah!

3532
02:08:03,500 --> 02:08:05,140
My logic made perfect sense.

3533
02:08:06,580 --> 02:08:10,600
You're saying that more people saved is a better option yet you're gonna...

3534
02:08:10,600 --> 02:08:13,080
America needs a fucking reality check anyway.

3535
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:13,920
It's all good.

3536
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:16,780
No!

3537
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:18,860
Okay, but what if we include N.A.

3538
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:19,980
instead of just America?

3539
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:24,920
I feel kinda sorry for Canada but I still save Croatia.

3540
02:08:24,920 --> 02:08:25,700
Oh, so you'll let your...

3541
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:27,560
You'll let your Reese drown?

3542
02:08:29,180 --> 02:08:30,240
Your Reese is in Japan.

3543
02:08:30,380 --> 02:08:30,720
We're good.

3544
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,220
Yeah, but he...

3545
02:08:32,220 --> 02:08:34,180
Yeah, he's Canadian!

3546
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:35,240
What about his family?

3547
02:08:35,900 --> 02:08:37,460
What about his family?

3548
02:08:38,420 --> 02:08:40,140
His family is from the Philippines.

3549
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:40,720
He's good.

3550
02:08:40,940 --> 02:08:42,480
He has family in Canada?

3551
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:44,040
What if...

3552
02:08:44,040 --> 02:08:45,160
His family is from the Philippines?

3553
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:46,760
His family is from the Philippines.

3554
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:51,800
I've sacrificed Doki for both.

3555
02:08:52,160 --> 02:08:52,720
Whoa!

3556
02:08:53,120 --> 02:08:55,380
I'm not even in either country!

3557
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,380
Yeah, but still.

3558
02:08:58,160 --> 02:08:58,740
That's good.

3559
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,000
Damn.

3560
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:02,880
That's fucked.

3561
02:09:04,680 --> 02:09:05,340
Oh, hey.

3562
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:06,220
I need that.

3563
02:09:06,360 --> 02:09:07,300
Actually, I don't.

3564
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:09,800
Oh, there's a...

3565
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:11,640
There's a purple... What about you?

3566
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:13,380
Why am I being asked these stupid questions?

3567
02:09:13,440 --> 02:09:14,980
Why are you guys not being asked these questions?

3568
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:15,600
Because...

3569
02:09:15,600 --> 02:09:16,940
Because we're the one asking.

3570
02:09:17,060 --> 02:09:18,460
Yeah, because we're the... You're not the one asking.

3571
02:09:18,780 --> 02:09:21,600
You could literally ask whenever you want, but you don't.

3572
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:23,620
You're just giving us this opportunity.

3573
02:09:25,620 --> 02:09:26,660
Sorry for making...

3574
02:09:26,660 --> 02:09:29,760
Oh, sorry for being content creators, RPR.

3575
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:31,260
Shut up.

3576
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:32,780
You're gonna make me cringe out.

3577
02:09:32,860 --> 02:09:33,560
Holy fuck.

3578
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:38,440
There's a line I drew and you just crossed it.

3579
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:41,900
Oh, sorry.

3580
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:44,120
We were just trying to make some content here.

3581
02:09:44,500 --> 02:09:46,140
Just my content brain.

3582
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:48,860
Shut the fuck up.

3583
02:09:51,260 --> 02:09:52,600
Where the fuck do we go?

3584
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:54,680
IGL.

3585
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:55,520
Where the juicer is.

3586
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:56,880
IGL, tell us where to go.

3587
02:09:57,800 --> 02:10:00,220
If you're in IGL, you should be leading us.

3588
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,440
I'm not in IGL.

3589
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:02,260
I'm not IGL.

3590
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:02,960
Why not?

3591
02:10:03,820 --> 02:10:04,480
You should practice.

3592
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:07,500
I'm not gonna waste my IQ on fucking rank.

3593
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:10,340
But you do for your team.

3594
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,660
What do you do for your team?

3595
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:13,800
I'm not playing with my team right now.

3596
02:10:13,900 --> 02:10:15,480
Yeah, but treat us like your team.

3597
02:10:15,820 --> 02:10:17,460
We're literally playing the same comp.

3598
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:17,840
No.

3599
02:10:18,460 --> 02:10:18,900
No.

3600
02:10:19,480 --> 02:10:21,400
We're playing like literally your team.

3601
02:10:22,840 --> 02:10:24,420
Yeah, we play octane in comp.

3602
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:25,940
Yeah, we're metagaming.

3603
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:28,140
We're metacrafting right now.

3604
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:29,620
Yeah, my team plays...

3605
02:10:29,620 --> 02:10:31,840
If my team played octane in comp, I'd fucking...

3606
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,080
We're gonna lose it.

3607
02:10:33,580 --> 02:10:34,220
People here.

3608
02:10:37,420 --> 02:10:38,760
I'm heading over, guys.

3609
02:10:38,940 --> 02:10:40,320
I don't know if you guys know this, but...

3610
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:41,520
I'm heading over.

3611
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:42,600
To help.

3612
02:10:43,640 --> 02:10:45,100
You know what's funny to me?

3613
02:10:45,340 --> 02:10:47,100
We've been doing this for how long now?

3614
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:48,140
Years upon years.

3615
02:10:48,500 --> 02:10:49,780
And people still think I'm mad.

3616
02:10:51,220 --> 02:10:53,160
People still think I get mad.

3617
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:57,520
If I'm a new viewer, I'd probably think you're mad.

3618
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:58,900
Because you would sound mad.

3619
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:03,740
If he was mad, he would've...

3620
02:11:04,340 --> 02:11:05,300
I just don't care.

3621
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:07,800
He's already...

3622
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:08,900
That's based on the voice.

3623
02:11:10,340 --> 02:11:12,180
Your voice is monotone-ish.

3624
02:11:12,280 --> 02:11:14,200
And you sound angry, but that's...

3625
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,440
It's just because he's European.

3626
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:17,460
It's because he's European, they always sound...

3627
02:11:17,460 --> 02:11:18,600
That is extreme discrimination.

3628
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,100
Oh my shit.

3629
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:28,200
Where are they?

3630
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:30,040
I don't know.

3631
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:31,060
They were just shooting you.

3632
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,280
Oh, so you're baiting again.

3633
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:35,840
Someone...

3634
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:36,740
Someone...

3635
02:11:37,220 --> 02:11:37,700
Someone...

3636
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,200
Is he angry or is he just European?

3637
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:42,440
We'll find out.

3638
02:11:45,940 --> 02:11:48,700
So what do you have to do to not appear angry?

3639
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:50,600
Like we just have to laugh all the time like you?

3640
02:11:50,760 --> 02:11:52,120
You just gotta be happier.

3641
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:54,740
I am happy, man.

3642
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:57,860
Don't assume you know what my mental state is.

3643
02:12:00,700 --> 02:12:02,840
That's mental assuming, dude.

3644
02:12:03,120 --> 02:12:04,520
Mental assuming.

3645
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:07,940
That's social suicide we just did.

3646
02:12:08,140 --> 02:12:09,120
What did I do?

3647
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:10,680
I'm just saying, you just gotta...

3648
02:12:10,680 --> 02:12:13,320
You just gotta be happier.

3649
02:12:14,580 --> 02:12:15,480
Oh my gosh.

3650
02:12:15,560 --> 02:12:16,620
Oh, you got knocked out.

3651
02:12:17,180 --> 02:12:18,300
Motherfucker booped me.

3652
02:12:18,580 --> 02:12:19,840
Where are you shooting at?

3653
02:12:20,040 --> 02:12:20,760
Oh, over there.

3654
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:21,740
Oh, it's two.

3655
02:12:24,680 --> 02:12:26,180
Okay, we have an issue.

3656
02:12:26,400 --> 02:12:28,160
And the issue is that guy beaming, dude.

3657
02:12:28,360 --> 02:12:28,960
Which one?

3658
02:12:30,240 --> 02:12:30,860
I don't know.

3659
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:31,900
The guy above you is beaming.

3660
02:12:32,020 --> 02:12:32,440
I'm bad.

3661
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:35,000
I'm heading to...

3662
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:36,120
He hates me.

3663
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:44,860
That guy just tried to drill my fucking wall, but you can't drill a Newcastle wall because it deletes it.

3664
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:45,800
That's crazy.

3665
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:49,580
So he's just a hater for no reason.

3666
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:50,580
Maybe he knows.

3667
02:12:50,680 --> 02:12:51,820
Maybe he's a stream sniper.

3668
02:12:53,100 --> 02:12:54,780
If he knows, why would he drill?

3669
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:58,240
Because, you know, he never plays against Newcastle.

3670
02:12:58,660 --> 02:13:00,240
So he thinks that's how it goes.

3671
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:01,480
I'm literally in plat.

3672
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:03,720
Don't assume what plat players think.

3673
02:13:03,980 --> 02:13:05,040
Then he doesn't know.

3674
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:06,440
Then don't say maybe he knows.

3675
02:13:06,580 --> 02:13:07,440
He doesn't know then.

3676
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:10,920
I said maybe he knows that you're there.

3677
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:12,200
So that's why he drilled it.

3678
02:13:12,240 --> 02:13:13,040
Because he's a stream sniper.

3679
02:13:13,960 --> 02:13:15,860
You didn't let me finish my sentence.

3680
02:13:17,780 --> 02:13:20,040
He didn't listen to what I said to begin with.

3681
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:21,980
There's people up here.

3682
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:24,860
I'm 69 EVO from purple.

3683
02:13:25,700 --> 02:13:26,180
So?

3684
02:13:27,780 --> 02:13:28,260
69.

3685
02:13:29,100 --> 02:13:29,580
So?

3686
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:33,060
69.

3687
02:13:33,540 --> 02:13:34,000
69.

3688
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,180
You're not dying in three seconds.

3689
02:13:36,120 --> 02:13:37,120
What's that mean?

3690
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:37,600
3, 2, 1.

3691
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:38,760
That means?

3692
02:13:39,140 --> 02:13:39,780
I'm here.

3693
02:13:40,660 --> 02:13:41,540
He's over there.

3694
02:13:41,660 --> 02:13:42,460
He joked you.

3695
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:44,800
He's going down the stairs.

3696
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:46,540
And shoot him?

3697
02:13:46,540 --> 02:13:47,260
He's running in the open.

3698
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:48,420
Shoot him!

3699
02:13:49,640 --> 02:13:50,680
He's so far.

3700
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:54,940
He's rev jumping.

3701
02:13:55,220 --> 02:13:55,320
Fucking Revenant players.

3702
02:13:55,720 --> 02:13:56,120
Disgusting.

3703
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,120
Where's our zipline?

3704
02:14:00,720 --> 02:14:01,380
I don't know.

3705
02:14:01,420 --> 02:14:02,180
We have an Octane.

3706
02:14:03,900 --> 02:14:04,620
Oh, he's leaving.

3707
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:08,440
Last time I checked, Octanes don't do...

3708
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:10,380
Someone just landed on us.

3709
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:10,840
Roof!

3710
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:11,540
Fight the guy on the roof!

3711
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:12,880
Oh, shit.

3712
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:13,920
What the fuck?

3713
02:14:15,140 --> 02:14:16,660
I'm batting, I'm batting, I'm batting.

3714
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:18,700
Oh, why did you literally...

3715
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:20,620
Why does his shield go left?

3716
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:24,300
What are you yapping about?

3717
02:14:24,580 --> 02:14:26,380
I was using his shield.

3718
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:27,100
They're coming.

3719
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,180
Oh, don't worry.

3720
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:31,040
He doesn't know what to do.

3721
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:33,240
Don't rest.

3722
02:14:33,460 --> 02:14:34,020
What are you doing?

3723
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:35,440
He doesn't know.

3724
02:14:35,640 --> 02:14:36,800
He's literally won.

3725
02:14:37,860 --> 02:14:38,780
You're welcome.

3726
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,240
I was your bait.

3727
02:14:41,140 --> 02:14:41,700
Wow.

3728
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:45,200
You just pushed me off.

3729
02:14:45,440 --> 02:14:46,720
That's so fun.

3730
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:49,000
That's so fun.

3731
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:49,700
That was hilarious.

3732
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:51,280
You just got dropped.

3733
02:14:51,720 --> 02:14:53,540
You just got dropped.

3734
02:14:54,660 --> 02:14:54,940
Wow.

3735
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:55,560
Wow.

3736
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:57,200
I'm going to remember this.

3737
02:14:57,320 --> 02:14:58,260
I'm going to remember this.

3738
02:14:59,140 --> 02:15:00,940
I'm going to fucking remember this.

3739
02:15:01,020 --> 02:15:02,860
I hope you don't get to play Newcastle.

3740
02:15:03,420 --> 02:15:06,640
I hope you don't get to play Newcastle.

3741
02:15:07,220 --> 02:15:07,780
Restia!

3742
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:09,460
He's getting at me!

3743
02:15:09,600 --> 02:15:10,160
Restia!

3744
02:15:10,520 --> 02:15:11,760
Don't let him do this!

3745
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:12,600
No!

3746
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:18,820
Restia!

3747
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:19,260
Restia!

3748
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:20,640
Don't let him do this.

3749
02:15:21,040 --> 02:15:21,620
Don't let him do this.

3750
02:15:22,080 --> 02:15:22,400
Don't you dare do that!

3751
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:22,640
I'll never do this again.

3752
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:22,660
Oh, yeah.

3753
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:23,880
This is what you guys get.

3754
02:15:23,880 --> 02:15:26,020
This is what you guys get.

3755
02:15:26,640 --> 02:15:27,280
That's right.

3756
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:28,420
That's fucking karma.

3757
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,440
Karma!

3758
02:15:29,720 --> 02:15:31,140
I can't believe it, Rusty.

3759
02:15:31,160 --> 02:15:32,280
After everything we've been through.

3760
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:33,080
After everything...

3761
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,920
I've been on your side this entire time.

3762
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:38,240
I'm gonna remember this.

3763
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:40,800
I'm sorry.

3764
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:41,400
I'm sorry.

3765
02:15:42,280 --> 02:15:43,620
I gotta do this.

3766
02:15:45,680 --> 02:15:47,600
Don't fall for her pity baiting, dude.

3767
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,420
Don't say you're sorry.

3768
02:15:55,500 --> 02:15:56,560
She'll think she won, dude.

3769
02:15:56,560 --> 02:15:58,300
Because I did win.

3770
02:15:58,380 --> 02:15:59,040
What do you mean?

3771
02:16:00,560 --> 02:16:01,400
You're gonna smoke.

3772
02:16:02,460 --> 02:16:03,200
There you go.

3773
02:16:03,260 --> 02:16:04,320
Now we're safe, guys.

3774
02:16:04,440 --> 02:16:05,140
Now we're safe.

3775
02:16:10,980 --> 02:16:11,420
Nice.

3776
02:16:13,700 --> 02:16:14,480
53 purple.

3777
02:16:16,160 --> 02:16:16,880
70 on one.

3778
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:19,260
I got scanned so they know I'm here.

3779
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:21,260
Where did he scan from?

3780
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:21,980
Below right side?

3781
02:16:22,480 --> 02:16:24,120
No, like... Oh, he's cracked.

3782
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:25,400
Nice, we got him.

3783
02:16:26,620 --> 02:16:27,400
You want me?

3784
02:16:27,640 --> 02:16:28,460
I have the bat.

3785
02:16:28,700 --> 02:16:29,460
I'm so big.

3786
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:31,540
There's one on you now.

3787
02:16:33,980 --> 02:16:34,700
Cracked that guy.

3788
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:35,560
Dead.

3789
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:41,060
No, I have gold lock.

3790
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:44,140
What?

3791
02:16:46,620 --> 02:16:47,360
He doesn't care.

3792
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:48,460
He doesn't even care.

3793
02:16:48,860 --> 02:16:49,860
He doesn't care.

3794
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:50,620
Look at him.

3795
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,080
I cared.

3796
02:16:54,720 --> 02:16:55,680
I cared.

3797
02:16:57,900 --> 02:16:58,840
We're even now.

3798
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:00,560
You just raised him.

3799
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,000
I did.

3800
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:03,020
I did raise him.

3801
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:05,240
Yeah, and then I was like, oh, you have...

3802
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:07,180
And then I just found out you had gold knock.

3803
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:08,580
So then I was like, oh, yeah, I should...

3804
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,240
I should let you...

3805
02:17:10,760 --> 02:17:11,960
Maybe we should take the...

3806
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:13,140
Oh, okay.

3807
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:15,520
Yeah, I don't think that's okay.

3808
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:16,760
I'm gonna ult.

3809
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:20,040
Oh, my God.

3810
02:17:20,200 --> 02:17:21,220
Oh, my God.

3811
02:17:21,560 --> 02:17:22,380
RPR, RPR.

3812
02:17:22,460 --> 02:17:24,700
We're so... RPR, we really need your help.

3813
02:17:27,260 --> 02:17:27,660
Um...

3814
02:17:27,660 --> 02:17:28,840
Yeah, I'm very healthy.

3815
02:17:30,120 --> 02:17:31,720
RPR, why did you do that?

3816
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:33,720
We could literally...

3817
02:17:33,720 --> 02:17:34,140
I don't know.

3818
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:36,580
Why did you, like, run away?

3819
02:17:36,920 --> 02:17:38,000
What do you mean?

3820
02:17:38,060 --> 02:17:40,280
There was three people and you left us.

3821
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:42,320
Like, what do you want me...

3822
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:44,260
Do you think there was anywhere I could have went or what?

3823
02:17:44,360 --> 02:17:46,560
You could have just ran downstairs.

3824
02:17:47,800 --> 02:17:49,520
You think I had the time for that?

3825
02:17:49,940 --> 02:17:50,420
Yeah.

3826
02:17:51,180 --> 02:17:52,220
We could craft you.

3827
02:17:52,500 --> 02:17:54,900
Clearly, you haven't seen what I saw.

3828
02:17:56,620 --> 02:17:57,500
Maybe they'll leave.

3829
02:17:57,780 --> 02:17:59,200
Can you go craft us right next to the...

3830
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:01,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3831
02:18:01,960 --> 02:18:03,200
Wait, do I have it?

3832
02:18:03,300 --> 02:18:04,360
But it's zone four.

3833
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:05,500
It's zone three.

3834
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:06,060
It's fine.

3835
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:07,520
Oh, okay.

3836
02:18:07,800 --> 02:18:09,400
Where is it?

3837
02:18:10,280 --> 02:18:11,600
It's right behind respawn beacon.

3838
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:12,360
Oh, okay.

3839
02:18:14,140 --> 02:18:14,860
Where is it?

3840
02:18:16,040 --> 02:18:18,300
You have to craft, go back, heal, then rest.

3841
02:18:18,460 --> 02:18:19,980
Um, I think I'm gonna die in zone.

3842
02:18:21,080 --> 02:18:22,120
Use your snogs.

3843
02:18:23,940 --> 02:18:24,880
What do you mean, use snogs?

3844
02:18:24,900 --> 02:18:26,340
Use my fucking... I'm gonna die in zone.

3845
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:27,000
Wait.

3846
02:18:28,120 --> 02:18:28,600
Wait!

3847
02:18:30,120 --> 02:18:31,080
I deadslide.

3848
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:36,120
I fucking deadslide.

3849
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:37,840
I blame...

3850
02:18:38,600 --> 02:18:40,280
I blame RPR for that.

3851
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,240
You know your smoke heals you, right?

3852
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:42,440
No, I didn't take it.

3853
02:18:42,540 --> 02:18:43,540
I didn't take the smoke.

3854
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:45,140
Why would you not take the healing smoke?

3855
02:18:45,720 --> 02:18:47,940
Why would I take the healing smoke?

3856
02:18:48,640 --> 02:18:51,040
Because there's no point in taking the other one.

3857
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:52,080
Yes, there is!

3858
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,560
When I was playing...

3859
02:18:54,900 --> 02:19:00,640
Every time I play in tournament settings, matches, I always ask the IGL, what should I get?

3860
02:19:00,740 --> 02:19:02,620
And they always say, get that other one.

3861
02:19:02,880 --> 02:19:04,040
And then, yes, yes.

3862
02:19:04,120 --> 02:19:08,700
I did so many tournaments with pro players and I always be like, what do I get?

3863
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:09,740
I always ask them.

3864
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:13,380
So I said, they don't do the smoke with heals.

3865
02:19:14,400 --> 02:19:15,120
Wait, wait, wait.

3866
02:19:15,180 --> 02:19:16,720
No one ever gets the other one.

3867
02:19:16,840 --> 02:19:17,300
The other one.

3868
02:19:18,320 --> 02:19:20,080
Please tell me you told you that.

3869
02:19:20,280 --> 02:19:21,860
Oh, the other IGLs!

3870
02:19:21,860 --> 02:19:22,560
I don't remember.

3871
02:19:22,740 --> 02:19:23,660
Let me look at my VOD.

3872
02:19:23,780 --> 02:19:26,980
I'll be like, what do I get, guys?

3873
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:28,500
Your Rhys told me to get that.

3874
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:30,040
I remember, your Rhys told me.

3875
02:19:30,220 --> 02:19:31,860
Your Rhys dropped...

3876
02:19:31,860 --> 02:19:33,440
Your Rhys is braindead then.

3877
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,480
Dropped is also braindead.

3878
02:19:38,480 --> 02:19:39,780
They told you that.

3879
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:40,720
This is just the fact.

3880
02:19:40,740 --> 02:19:42,680
The regen is really good.

3881
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:45,920
Why would they tell me to get the other one?

3882
02:19:46,660 --> 02:19:47,620
They're baiting you.

3883
02:19:48,920 --> 02:19:49,660
I don't know.

3884
02:19:49,660 --> 02:19:51,120
Maybe they don't play Bangalore.

3885
02:19:51,280 --> 02:19:53,080
Or they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.

3886
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:53,780
I don't know.

3887
02:19:54,120 --> 02:19:55,840
They lied to you, maybe.

3888
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,280
Even dropped.

3889
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:01,080
Yeah, I mean, maybe he did.

3890
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,240
Clearly told you to take the wrong perk.

3891
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:08,260
Damn.

3892
02:20:09,820 --> 02:20:14,140
I have never seen a Bang player in pro play not take the regen in smoke.

3893
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:16,120
I mean, that's what they told me to get.

3894
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:17,320
They told me to get the other one.

3895
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:18,820
So I just followed what they said.

3896
02:20:19,660 --> 02:20:20,780
Soldiers listen to orders.

3897
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:24,120
They're bad orders.

3898
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:25,000
No gun, no gun.

3899
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:27,520
I wasn't gonna question them.

3900
02:20:27,580 --> 02:20:28,680
They are literally the pro player.

3901
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:31,700
You should have questioned it.

3902
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:33,480
You shouldn't just follow people blindly.

3903
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:34,320
Yes, I should.

3904
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:36,700
We are sandwiched between two teams.

3905
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:37,440
It's not good.

3906
02:20:38,200 --> 02:20:39,800
Yeah, we are.

3907
02:20:40,280 --> 02:20:42,460
I guess Shock surprised me.

3908
02:20:42,760 --> 02:20:43,720
Where's the other player?

3909
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:44,700
Hey, I led him to you.

3910
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:47,140
Okay, yeah.

3911
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:52,680
Alright, so you didn't say anything about that other player.

3912
02:20:53,800 --> 02:20:55,000
That you were running from.

3913
02:20:55,220 --> 02:20:57,500
Yeah, but you never said which side.

3914
02:20:57,740 --> 02:20:58,620
I just followed you.

3915
02:20:59,880 --> 02:21:01,420
Yeah, I'm trying to help.

3916
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:01,860
I'm struggling.

3917
02:21:03,680 --> 02:21:05,220
Guys, I hope you guys die.

3918
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:06,880
So we can re-heal.

3919
02:21:06,920 --> 02:21:08,800
Why the fuck would you even say that?

3920
02:21:08,800 --> 02:21:09,900
That fucking team player.

3921
02:21:11,780 --> 02:21:12,480
Oh my god.

3922
02:21:14,300 --> 02:21:15,820
I'm gonna lead a team to you guys.

3923
02:21:15,980 --> 02:21:17,840
Why did that guy chase us all the way here?

3924
02:21:17,840 --> 02:21:20,180
Oh, there's gonna be another chaser soon.

3925
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:21,940
Oh, never mind.

3926
02:21:22,060 --> 02:21:23,280
They're too busy fighting.

3927
02:21:23,660 --> 02:21:24,820
They're busy dying.

3928
02:21:24,880 --> 02:21:25,400
Yeah.

3929
02:21:26,580 --> 02:21:28,000
They just died.

3930
02:21:29,240 --> 02:21:30,340
Yeah, I'm safe.

3931
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:31,220
Are you?

3932
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:34,580
Yeah.

3933
02:21:35,440 --> 02:21:37,940
They're not even looking outside.

3934
02:21:39,220 --> 02:21:40,120
You're Newcastle.

3935
02:21:40,420 --> 02:21:41,460
You're always safe.

3936
02:21:41,860 --> 02:21:42,840
I have to run to you.

3937
02:21:42,880 --> 02:21:43,520
Take some time.

3938
02:21:44,100 --> 02:21:45,580
Yeah, and you have a shield.

3939
02:21:45,580 --> 02:21:48,100
Oh, and now you're gonna make sure we get shot in the back.

3940
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:50,900
No, I'm looking where we can go up.

3941
02:21:53,140 --> 02:21:54,220
Oh my gosh.

3942
02:21:55,700 --> 02:21:56,900
Alright, then what do you get?

3943
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:59,500
Do you get tactical cooldown or ultimate cooldown?

3944
02:22:00,400 --> 02:22:01,620
You get smoke cooldown.

3945
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:02,440
Yeah, tactical.

3946
02:22:02,740 --> 02:22:04,480
Yeah, okay, and then you get smoke.

3947
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:06,200
You get regenerate HP.

3948
02:22:07,740 --> 02:22:12,880
Because as Bangler, all you wanna do is you wanna play inside your smokes all the fucking time.

3949
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,320
Because now you just get wallhack when you're in smoke.

3950
02:22:15,580 --> 02:22:17,500
Okay, maybe it's because the meta changed.

3951
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:20,480
The old meta was like, the left side was better.

3952
02:22:20,660 --> 02:22:21,700
In the old meta.

3953
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:23,360
It was always like that.

3954
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:24,280
No, it wasn't.

3955
02:22:24,280 --> 02:22:24,680
I remember.

3956
02:22:24,920 --> 02:22:27,880
I did so many of those Twitch Rivals and...

3957
02:22:27,880 --> 02:22:28,960
Oh yeah!

3958
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:29,680
Mack!

3959
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:32,140
UpperLaylee also told me to get that, too.

3960
02:22:32,820 --> 02:22:34,940
I don't know what's Mack smoking, dude.

3961
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:41,480
Literally, when I was on team with Mack, he told me to get the left side, too.

3962
02:22:42,380 --> 02:22:43,760
Where am I getting shot at?

3963
02:22:45,060 --> 02:22:45,540
Oh!

3964
02:22:45,580 --> 02:22:46,600
Right here, behind us!

3965
02:22:47,540 --> 02:22:48,060
Okay.

3966
02:22:48,360 --> 02:22:50,000
Well, there's another team behind us.

3967
02:22:50,840 --> 02:22:57,040
Guys, there's a full team right behind us, by the way.

3968
02:22:58,540 --> 02:23:01,160
Is there armor swaps that I need?

3969
02:23:01,200 --> 02:23:01,940
I don't have shields.

3970
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:03,560
Okay.

3971
02:23:05,480 --> 02:23:07,720
There's a full team right behind.

3972
02:23:10,060 --> 02:23:10,580
Where?

3973
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,240
It was a horizon.

3974
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:13,280
It was like this direction.

3975
02:23:14,340 --> 02:23:15,080
Probably one.

3976
02:23:15,880 --> 02:23:16,560
I don't know.

3977
02:23:16,640 --> 02:23:19,500
I just know there's a horizon that shot me from that direction.

3978
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:23,180
Someone said, Mack has the VTuber brain.

3979
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:26,700
Wait, your guy debuted to one time?

3980
02:23:26,980 --> 02:23:31,240
He fucking gets a VTuber model and instantly plug in as a VTuber.

3981
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,080
This is before he got the model!

3982
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:35,460
No, he had the model for a while.

3983
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:36,440
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

3984
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:37,080
Oh, okay.

3985
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:41,640
Wait, then how does that explain to all the other pro players that fucked me over?

3986
02:23:41,940 --> 02:23:44,840
I can't imagine, like, dropping Doki.

3987
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:48,620
Yeah, I don't really I don't know what the fuck happened.

3988
02:23:48,700 --> 02:23:52,640
Why did so many pro players fuck me over there?

3989
02:23:53,440 --> 02:24:01,200
Literally every time I put it on a Bangalore, I'd be like I would literally ask each pro what do I get for my skill tree?

3990
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,300
Every time!

3991
02:24:03,800 --> 02:24:05,320
How long ago was this?

3992
02:24:05,900 --> 02:24:08,160
This was like for the past six months.

3993
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:11,140
Hashtag Doki.

3994
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,440
Maybe it was like...

3995
02:24:13,540 --> 02:24:15,080
Can I get a look at my VODs?

3996
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:20,540
Maybe it was a different update before they changed the perks or something, I don't know.

3997
02:24:20,560 --> 02:24:21,380
No, no, I remember.

3998
02:24:21,600 --> 02:24:22,900
The region was there.

3999
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:27,020
They tell you to pick the left one and you're like, oh, left one, it should be right.

4000
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:28,580
No, and I would read it out.

4001
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,760
I'd be like oh, you mean like the the cover me?

4002
02:24:32,900 --> 02:24:34,240
The cover me one?

4003
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:41,480
I don't even remember what's the other one.

4004
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:42,240
What's the other one?

4005
02:24:43,540 --> 02:24:45,720
The one that pings the people from the smoke thing.

4006
02:24:47,180 --> 02:24:49,200
So it gives you intel.

4007
02:24:51,060 --> 02:25:00,100
I don't know, I just know healing your smoke is better because you often, as Bangalore, you fight inside smoke and then you get cracked and then you just full heal.

4008
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:04,360
Yeah, you full, you like half heal out of a bad.

4009
02:25:04,560 --> 02:25:05,740
Oh, I see.

4010
02:25:07,280 --> 02:25:09,960
Oh wait, there's a team behind us because that's an Ashe.

4011
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:12,740
Let's kill them.

4012
02:25:13,100 --> 02:25:13,500
Alright.

4013
02:25:14,320 --> 02:25:15,200
What do I keep?

4014
02:25:15,360 --> 02:25:16,740
I wanna do triple take right now.

4015
02:25:16,880 --> 02:25:18,520
I feel like triple taking.

4016
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:21,740
I'm gonna go throw.

4017
02:25:22,060 --> 02:25:23,960
I mean, I've been throwing this entire day, but like...

4018
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:30,620
I don't know, maybe there was a patch in which heal was weak, but as far as I can remember, heal was always strong as fuck.

4019
02:25:32,280 --> 02:25:32,960
Yeah, that's true.

4020
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:34,760
They're landing on her.

4021
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:36,300
Wait, there's one close.

4022
02:25:36,400 --> 02:25:36,720
What the fuck?

4023
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:38,260
See one.

4024
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:39,120
Cracked.

4025
02:25:40,300 --> 02:25:41,440
He's right below us here.

4026
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:42,900
Alright, go for it.

4027
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:44,820
He's hiding.

4028
02:25:45,260 --> 02:25:46,180
You got this.

4029
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:48,640
I got him.

4030
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:50,480
You're welcome.

4031
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,080
Wait, what?

4032
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:54,580
That's...

4033
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:57,400
Okay, there's a Pathfinder next to us.

4034
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:58,740
There's a whole team.

4035
02:26:00,280 --> 02:26:01,200
Why me?

4036
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:02,940
Why me?

4037
02:26:03,760 --> 02:26:04,500
We're running.

4038
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:06,260
Why me?

4039
02:26:07,100 --> 02:26:07,600
Why?

4040
02:26:11,620 --> 02:26:12,100
It doesn't matter.

4041
02:26:12,100 --> 02:26:12,540
I cracked the Horizon.

4042
02:26:12,620 --> 02:26:12,960
I cracked the Horizon.

4043
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:16,120
Zero said the ping was nerfed and the heal was buffed.

4044
02:26:16,140 --> 02:26:16,520
I cracked the Horizon.

4045
02:26:16,520 --> 02:26:17,520
I still lagged in RoT.

4046
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:28,640
Yo, I right

4047
02:26:32,210 --> 02:26:43,510
now dying in Miraculous and in this situation.

4048
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:44,150
A lot of health.

4049
02:26:44,270 --> 02:26:45,730
Oh, well you should...

4050
02:26:46,130 --> 02:26:46,470
Oh.

4051
02:26:47,430 --> 02:26:48,090
Wait, what?

4052
02:26:48,670 --> 02:26:50,650
What was that double knock sound?

4053
02:26:51,030 --> 02:26:52,050
They're coming, they're coming, they're coming.

4054
02:26:52,590 --> 02:26:53,250
I believe.

4055
02:26:54,890 --> 02:26:55,490
I believe.

4056
02:26:55,690 --> 02:26:56,390
Oh, there's no audio on that guy.

4057
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,010
Oh, 102!

4058
02:26:58,630 --> 02:26:59,270
Pop it in one, pop it in one!

4059
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:00,250
Last guy, last guy!

4060
02:27:00,570 --> 02:27:00,910
Yeah!

4061
02:27:01,750 --> 02:27:02,090
See?

4062
02:27:02,490 --> 02:27:05,130
I need another, I need another fucking heat shield now.

4063
02:27:05,810 --> 02:27:06,570
I don't have one.

4064
02:27:06,590 --> 02:27:07,070
Heat shield, heat shield.

4065
02:27:07,250 --> 02:27:07,830
I don't have one.

4066
02:27:08,530 --> 02:27:11,950
Well, wouldn't it be funny if you also die in zone?

4067
02:27:13,510 --> 02:27:14,710
Nah, I have zone one open.

4068
02:27:18,050 --> 02:27:18,730
Hey guys.

4069
02:27:19,030 --> 02:27:20,290
Did you still...

4070
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,670
Yeah, but that was a long time ago, I'm pretty sure.

4071
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:23,850
Was it really?

4072
02:27:24,090 --> 02:27:24,870
When was it?

4073
02:27:25,630 --> 02:27:26,870
It was probably like six months ago or something.

4074
02:27:26,870 --> 02:27:28,250
There's no way it was six months ago.

4075
02:27:28,350 --> 02:27:29,050
There's no way.

4076
02:27:30,650 --> 02:27:31,570
There's no way.

4077
02:27:31,910 --> 02:27:32,130
I mean...

4078
02:27:32,130 --> 02:27:33,290
Oh my god, someone else on you.

4079
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:33,670
Are you good?

4080
02:27:33,930 --> 02:27:34,870
I don't think so.

4081
02:27:35,130 --> 02:27:35,570
Probably not.

4082
02:27:35,770 --> 02:27:36,550
Probably not.

4083
02:27:36,650 --> 02:27:37,690
You might need to craft him.

4084
02:27:37,850 --> 02:27:38,470
You might...

4085
02:27:38,470 --> 02:27:40,150
Yeah, you might need to craft him.

4086
02:27:40,170 --> 02:27:40,530
Just leave.

4087
02:27:41,370 --> 02:27:42,550
Is that a whole new team?

4088
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:43,270
Yeah.

4089
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:46,790
It was like the duo from like just now.

4090
02:27:46,910 --> 02:27:47,550
Oh, it's a duo.

4091
02:27:47,630 --> 02:27:48,410
I could have killed him.

4092
02:27:48,610 --> 02:27:49,010
No.

4093
02:27:49,150 --> 02:27:50,090
I don't think so.

4094
02:27:52,550 --> 02:27:53,790
Now we'll never know.

4095
02:27:59,830 --> 02:28:00,470
Give me that.

4096
02:28:01,970 --> 02:28:03,310
Now we'll never know.

4097
02:28:06,760 --> 02:28:08,480
I don't know, but the heal...

4098
02:28:08,480 --> 02:28:11,400
The Bangalore heal has been meta for a while now.

4099
02:28:11,780 --> 02:28:12,480
They said...

4100
02:28:12,480 --> 02:28:15,100
People in my chat said it got nerfed buffed in March.

4101
02:28:15,380 --> 02:28:16,540
But like I had...

4102
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:18,380
I had to play Bangalore.

4103
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:19,620
After March.

4104
02:28:19,700 --> 02:28:21,760
That's fucking six months ago.

4105
02:28:21,940 --> 02:28:22,420
Literally.

4106
02:28:22,640 --> 02:28:24,580
Yeah, but I had to play Bangalore after March.

4107
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:26,720
And I still got told to put that.

4108
02:28:26,920 --> 02:28:28,600
And every time I would ask.

4109
02:28:28,740 --> 02:28:30,020
I would ask every time.

4110
02:28:30,020 --> 02:28:31,280
Your teammates were uneducated.

4111
02:28:32,760 --> 02:28:33,900
I don't know what to tell you.

4112
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:34,440
One of them is...

4113
02:28:34,440 --> 02:28:35,780
One of them is your teammate.

4114
02:28:35,920 --> 02:28:37,340
Why aren't you educating your teammate?

4115
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:39,540
He's not...

4116
02:28:39,540 --> 02:28:39,880
Yeah.

4117
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:41,860
He's not what?

4118
02:28:42,100 --> 02:28:43,040
He plays Newcastle.

4119
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:45,700
You put your Reese on Newcastle?

4120
02:28:46,400 --> 02:28:46,880
Yeah.

4121
02:28:47,880 --> 02:28:48,360
He's not...

4122
02:28:48,360 --> 02:28:49,180
He plays Newcastle.

4123
02:28:50,500 --> 02:28:51,560
I got Ricky...

4124
02:28:51,560 --> 02:28:52,600
I got Ricky on...

4125
02:28:52,600 --> 02:28:57,220
Ricky on fucking Pathfinder because he's most mechanically skilled.

4126
02:28:57,620 --> 02:28:58,020
Yeah.

4127
02:28:58,280 --> 02:28:58,460
But...

4128
02:28:59,020 --> 02:29:00,360
You Reese on Newcastle.

4129
02:29:00,740 --> 02:29:01,140
And...

4130
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:02,980
Because I can't IGL on Newcastle.

4131
02:29:03,080 --> 02:29:03,980
And I'm on Bang.

4132
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:05,320
Wait.

4133
02:29:05,380 --> 02:29:06,820
Why can't you IGL on Newcastle?

4134
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:15,060
Because if you have to rez and throw a shield and I'll do all this shit, you don't have time to focus and tell people what to do while you're fucking doing all the fucking...

4135
02:29:15,060 --> 02:29:17,400
Aren't there other IGLs on Newcastle?

4136
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:17,780
Yeah.

4137
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:18,860
Are there other IGLs on Bang?

4138
02:29:20,360 --> 02:29:20,840
None of them?

4139
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:21,040
None of them?

4140
02:29:22,740 --> 02:29:23,160
Oh.

4141
02:29:23,540 --> 02:29:24,720
You're sending us to die.

4142
02:29:26,160 --> 02:29:26,580
Oh.

4143
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:27,900
Our peer is dead.

4144
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:28,420
I don't...

4145
02:29:28,420 --> 02:29:29,560
Rusty, I don't...

4146
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:31,000
I don't think we should...

4147
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,120
I got the rez though.

4148
02:29:32,720 --> 02:29:34,100
Where do we go, Rusty?

4149
02:29:34,680 --> 02:29:35,100
Rusty!

4150
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:37,800
Where do we go, Rusty?

4151
02:29:38,520 --> 02:29:39,720
Rusty, where do we go?

4152
02:29:39,980 --> 02:29:40,920
We just killed the team.

4153
02:29:41,080 --> 02:29:41,380
You guys win those?

4154
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:42,320
Just win.

4155
02:29:42,420 --> 02:29:43,020
You guys win those.

4156
02:29:43,100 --> 02:29:43,340
Yeah.

4157
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:44,320
Just kill them.

4158
02:29:45,840 --> 02:29:46,520
We got one?

4159
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:47,760
I got one.

4160
02:29:47,780 --> 02:29:48,260
I got one.

4161
02:29:48,420 --> 02:29:48,940
Okay.

4162
02:29:49,160 --> 02:29:51,140
I have a fucking triple tick!

4163
02:29:51,360 --> 02:29:51,900
I forgot!

4164
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:54,860
I forgot I had triple tick.

4165
02:29:54,940 --> 02:29:55,300
I forgot I had triple tick.

4166
02:29:55,300 --> 02:29:57,600
I got killed in Mozambique though.

4167
02:29:57,720 --> 02:29:58,320
I got...

4168
02:29:58,320 --> 02:30:01,880
I forgot I had a fucking triple tick when I dropped down.

4169
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:04,460
It's okay.

4170
02:30:04,560 --> 02:30:05,640
We griefed this team.

4171
02:30:07,240 --> 02:30:09,500
They actually died because of this.

4172
02:30:09,620 --> 02:30:10,140
Yeah.

4173
02:30:10,340 --> 02:30:10,860
Because...

4174
02:30:10,860 --> 02:30:11,320
Yeah.

4175
02:30:11,360 --> 02:30:12,720
That's why they deserve it.

4176
02:30:12,900 --> 02:30:14,620
No, they could like literally...

4177
02:30:14,620 --> 02:30:15,740
They could literally...

4178
02:30:15,740 --> 02:30:15,880
Wait.

4179
02:30:15,920 --> 02:30:16,460
I think they're gonna...

4180
02:30:16,460 --> 02:30:16,600
Yeah.

4181
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:17,540
They're gonna craft them.

4182
02:30:17,620 --> 02:30:17,760
Yeah.

4183
02:30:18,680 --> 02:30:19,920
That's so stupid.

4184
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:21,440
Why don't they commit?

4185
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:24,240
That's what they get for fucking...

4186
02:30:24,240 --> 02:30:24,500
Yeah.

4187
02:30:24,960 --> 02:30:26,740
...jumping on me while I'm rezzing the...

4188
02:30:26,740 --> 02:30:28,640
Oh, and they get finisher.

4189
02:30:28,740 --> 02:30:29,580
They deserve that.

4190
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:33,660
They fucking deserve that.

4191
02:30:34,120 --> 02:30:38,040
I like that they added this new volume bar while you're spectating.

4192
02:30:38,180 --> 02:30:38,840
Holy shit.

4193
02:30:38,840 --> 02:30:39,160
Oh, yeah.

4194
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:39,520
It's life-saving.

4195
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:41,100
Makes it...

4196
02:30:41,100 --> 02:30:41,900
Oh, what is he...

4197
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:42,900
Why is he shooting?

4198
02:30:43,920 --> 02:30:45,820
He could literally craft them.

4199
02:30:47,240 --> 02:30:47,760
I don't know.

4200
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:49,040
He could literally craft them.

4201
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:49,660
Not Team Lair.

4202
02:30:49,680 --> 02:30:50,700
He could literally use that crafter.

4203
02:30:51,020 --> 02:30:52,900
He literally could just...

4204
02:30:52,900 --> 02:30:54,320
There's a crafter right next to him.

4205
02:30:54,340 --> 02:30:54,360
Oh, no.

4206
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:55,480
He doesn't have to craft them.

4207
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:56,420
He fucking has his beacon.

4208
02:30:56,680 --> 02:30:57,120
Yeah.

4209
02:30:57,120 --> 02:30:58,100
He has the banner, Doki.

4210
02:30:58,840 --> 02:30:59,280
Oh.

4211
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:01,800
No, he could literally craft his teammates right there.

4212
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:05,540
They have like Loba and Lifeline.

4213
02:31:05,640 --> 02:31:06,940
That's two crafters.

4214
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:10,660
And this guy is beaming with a 301.

4215
02:31:10,700 --> 02:31:11,340
He did 40 damage.

4216
02:31:11,340 --> 02:31:11,760
Oh, my God.

4217
02:31:11,800 --> 02:31:12,720
He's an MNK player.

4218
02:31:12,820 --> 02:31:13,440
That's so rare.

4219
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:15,500
No, that's not him.

4220
02:31:15,500 --> 02:31:16,060
No, he's controller.

4221
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:17,160
Wait.

4222
02:31:17,160 --> 02:31:18,300
Are you saying he's lying?

4223
02:31:20,820 --> 02:31:21,380
No, no.

4224
02:31:21,440 --> 02:31:22,420
I'm talking about this fucking...

4225
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:23,020
Who are you watching?

4226
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:23,460
I'm watching this Ashe.

4227
02:31:23,480 --> 02:31:25,060
I'm looking at MNK, Sakura, Bloom.

4228
02:31:26,360 --> 02:31:26,840
Oh, no.

4229
02:31:26,860 --> 02:31:27,840
I'm watching a different guy.

4230
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:28,300
Oh, wait.

4231
02:31:28,380 --> 02:31:29,740
There's a different guy that killed you?

4232
02:31:30,940 --> 02:31:31,300
Yeah.

4233
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:31,720
This Ashe.

4234
02:31:32,280 --> 02:31:32,780
Oh, yeah.

4235
02:31:32,860 --> 02:31:34,720
I'm watching an MNK player.

4236
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:37,440
Guys, we can win in plat, right?

4237
02:31:38,580 --> 02:31:39,240
Yeah, definitely.

4238
02:31:40,580 --> 02:31:40,940
Yes.

4239
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:42,460
Yes, we can.

4240
02:31:42,540 --> 02:31:43,520
I believe in us.

4241
02:31:43,660 --> 02:31:44,220
All the time.

4242
02:31:44,440 --> 02:31:46,620
I win in plat all the time, personally.

4243
02:31:46,840 --> 02:31:47,040
Yeah.

4244
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:47,140
Me too.

4245
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:48,800
Yeah.

4246
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:49,760
Personally, I do.

4247
02:31:50,060 --> 02:31:50,500
Yeah.

4248
02:31:50,520 --> 02:31:51,400
What about you, Ristia?

4249
02:31:52,840 --> 02:31:53,660
I'm a plat player.

4250
02:31:54,020 --> 02:31:54,980
I never win in plat.

4251
02:31:57,220 --> 02:31:57,660
Wait.

4252
02:31:57,760 --> 02:31:58,900
How did you get to plat?

4253
02:31:59,120 --> 02:32:00,160
Why are you in plat?

4254
02:32:00,860 --> 02:32:01,960
I was not playing.

4255
02:32:01,960 --> 02:32:02,760
How did you get there?

4256
02:32:03,620 --> 02:32:05,080
No, you have to get there.

4257
02:32:05,140 --> 02:32:05,700
Why did you stop playing Inter, Ristia?

4258
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:06,120
What happened?

4259
02:32:06,900 --> 02:32:08,300
No, I was busy.

4260
02:32:08,580 --> 02:32:10,540
I just like came back from US.

4261
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:11,060
Oh, yeah.

4262
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:11,900
You went to...

4263
02:32:11,900 --> 02:32:12,980
You went to Google.

4264
02:32:13,160 --> 02:32:13,800
I saw it.

4265
02:32:14,180 --> 02:32:14,440
Yeah.

4266
02:32:14,540 --> 02:32:14,960
Yeah.

4267
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:17,080
He went to the Google headquarters because he's important.

4268
02:32:17,080 --> 02:32:17,120
Yeah.

4269
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:21,140
Because I'm a YouTuber, so I'm like a Google employee.

4270
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:25,960
I got like an engineer from a chat, like from Google, and he's just like a little man.

4271
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:26,520
That's so cool.

4272
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:28,620
Showed me like the Google in Seattle.

4273
02:32:28,820 --> 02:32:29,120
Yeah.

4274
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:33,100
Do I have engineers in my chat, guys?

4275
02:32:33,860 --> 02:32:34,260
Yeah.

4276
02:32:35,100 --> 02:32:35,640
I did.

4277
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:35,760
I did.

4278
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:39,860
So you got to go to the Google offices because like one of your...

4279
02:32:39,860 --> 02:32:40,160
Yeah.

4280
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:40,340
Yeah.

4281
02:32:40,360 --> 02:32:41,040
It was super cool.

4282
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:45,580
One of your chatters was like an employee, like one of your fans was an employee at Google.

4283
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:47,120
Yeah.

4284
02:32:47,140 --> 02:32:47,260
Yeah.

4285
02:32:47,260 --> 02:32:54,960
And the funny part was like after you know the chat, like Google employee, like he knows all the people like in Seattle.

4286
02:32:55,160 --> 02:32:56,980
So we actually went to like Amazon.

4287
02:32:57,160 --> 02:32:58,480
It was like a sphere thing.

4288
02:32:58,680 --> 02:32:58,840
What?

4289
02:32:58,860 --> 02:32:59,540
It was like super cool.

4290
02:32:59,740 --> 02:33:01,340
You went to Amazon too?

4291
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:02,440
Yeah.

4292
02:33:02,440 --> 02:33:02,600
Yeah.

4293
02:33:02,740 --> 02:33:03,140
Oh, wait.

4294
02:33:03,180 --> 02:33:03,580
That's cool.

4295
02:33:04,720 --> 02:33:05,800
Did you steal a package?

4296
02:33:06,980 --> 02:33:08,000
You saw the warehouse?

4297
02:33:09,020 --> 02:33:09,420
Yeah.

4298
02:33:09,420 --> 02:33:09,940
I saw the warehouse.

4299
02:33:10,180 --> 02:33:10,820
Oh, my God.

4300
02:33:10,920 --> 02:33:12,500
You saw the actual Amazon warehouse?

4301
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:14,000
Yeah.

4302
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:14,440
I was like...

4303
02:33:14,440 --> 02:33:14,460
I cracked one of them.

4304
02:33:14,560 --> 02:33:15,420
You should have stolen a package.

4305
02:33:15,420 --> 02:33:15,860
Two balls.

4306
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:16,100
Yeah.

4307
02:33:16,440 --> 02:33:17,200
That's two balls.

4308
02:33:17,340 --> 02:33:17,600
Oh.

4309
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:20,160
Did you see the bottles?

4310
02:33:20,700 --> 02:33:21,140
Wait.

4311
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:22,180
Did you actually like...

4312
02:33:22,180 --> 02:33:23,840
You could actually IRL stream from there?

4313
02:33:24,320 --> 02:33:24,760
Yeah.

4314
02:33:24,760 --> 02:33:25,100
You can.

4315
02:33:25,100 --> 02:33:25,280
You can.

4316
02:33:25,640 --> 02:33:26,720
There's people who are left.

4317
02:33:26,720 --> 02:33:27,160
Like not inside...

4318
02:33:27,160 --> 02:33:30,720
Like there was like a huge like plant house, like warehouse.

4319
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,380
Like there's so much like...

4320
02:33:32,380 --> 02:33:33,240
How to say?

4321
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:34,820
Like plants inside.

4322
02:33:35,980 --> 02:33:37,160
Like 30K plants.

4323
02:33:37,300 --> 02:33:37,560
Yeah.

4324
02:33:37,680 --> 02:33:39,260
And people actually work there.

4325
02:33:39,380 --> 02:33:40,460
You can like check out my Twitter.

4326
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:41,460
You'll know what it is.

4327
02:33:42,480 --> 02:33:44,620
There's like a whole team behind us, guys.

4328
02:33:44,820 --> 02:33:45,840
That's like looking at us.

4329
02:33:46,620 --> 02:33:47,100
We're like...

4330
02:33:47,100 --> 02:33:47,260
Oh, shit.

4331
02:33:47,360 --> 02:33:48,260
It's Newcastle on the left.

4332
02:33:48,400 --> 02:33:48,740
Yeah.

4333
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:50,480
I cracked two.

4334
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:52,280
Sick nade, bro.

4335
02:33:52,860 --> 02:33:53,500
All right.

4336
02:33:53,620 --> 02:33:55,000
It's that Newcastle, I believe.

4337
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,000
I'm watching.

4338
02:33:56,660 --> 02:33:57,340
All right.

4339
02:33:57,380 --> 02:33:57,980
I'm one.

4340
02:33:58,340 --> 02:33:59,280
I'm pushing this guy.

4341
02:34:02,080 --> 02:34:02,560
Whoa.

4342
02:34:02,600 --> 02:34:03,080
Whoa.

4343
02:34:03,080 --> 02:34:03,680
I'm getting shot.

4344
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:04,400
Yeah.

4345
02:34:04,420 --> 02:34:05,100
I mean, we're getting traded.

4346
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:07,280
Newcastle dead.

4347
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:07,920
Nice.

4348
02:34:08,600 --> 02:34:09,800
We're the better Newcastle.

4349
02:34:09,880 --> 02:34:10,240
That's crazy.

4350
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:14,020
Garcia is literally one HP.

4351
02:34:15,140 --> 02:34:15,840
Oakland dead.

4352
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:16,900
It's okay.

4353
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:18,060
We got a pro player here.

4354
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:18,280
Yeah.

4355
02:34:18,320 --> 02:34:18,680
That's true.

4356
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:20,920
If he can't 1v2, then like...

4357
02:34:20,920 --> 02:34:21,540
They're running.

4358
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:23,260
What's the point?

4359
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:25,500
What's the point of having a pro player?

4360
02:34:27,240 --> 02:34:27,700
I'm sending...

4361
02:34:27,700 --> 02:34:28,320
I'm not a pro player.

4362
02:34:29,720 --> 02:34:32,740
You literally said you're more pro than Restia.

4363
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:34,040
Yeah.

4364
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:35,180
But it doesn't make me a pro player.

4365
02:34:36,260 --> 02:34:37,060
I'm sending...

4366
02:34:37,580 --> 02:34:38,700
You got this, Restia.

4367
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:39,620
I believe in you.

4368
02:34:39,620 --> 02:34:40,220
Your team is already on us.

4369
02:34:40,740 --> 02:34:41,140
Okay.

4370
02:34:43,060 --> 02:34:44,480
We might need your help, Restia.

4371
02:34:44,820 --> 02:34:45,220
Yeah.

4372
02:34:45,440 --> 02:34:45,840
Yeah.

4373
02:34:45,860 --> 02:34:46,320
Wait.

4374
02:34:46,320 --> 02:34:46,880
Where are...

4375
02:34:47,300 --> 02:34:47,700
Where are they?

4376
02:34:47,700 --> 02:34:48,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

4377
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:49,680
They're turning rockets on me.

4378
02:34:49,980 --> 02:34:51,380
On the roof over here.

4379
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:52,800
Below the roof.

4380
02:34:52,880 --> 02:34:53,880
One's to the left, Doki.

4381
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:55,120
One's to the left.

4382
02:34:55,260 --> 02:34:56,640
I cracked one of them.

4383
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:58,180
Where's the two on the left?

4384
02:34:58,220 --> 02:34:58,360
One's on your left.

4385
02:34:58,380 --> 02:34:58,860
Oh, I see him.

4386
02:34:58,900 --> 02:34:59,260
Like, super left.

4387
02:35:01,160 --> 02:35:02,520
He's right over there behind this box.

4388
02:35:02,820 --> 02:35:03,220
They're getting close.

4389
02:35:05,060 --> 02:35:05,960
They're not getting close.

4390
02:35:05,960 --> 02:35:06,580
They're not getting close.

4391
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:07,240
You're such a...

4392
02:35:07,240 --> 02:35:07,580
Wait.

4393
02:35:07,660 --> 02:35:09,120
There's this guy right over there.

4394
02:35:09,160 --> 02:35:10,260
He's so far away from us.

4395
02:35:10,520 --> 02:35:12,540
Why is he lomboing me from Narnia?

4396
02:35:12,580 --> 02:35:12,920
Yeah.

4397
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:13,820
This guy is so far.

4398
02:35:15,260 --> 02:35:15,720
He's not getting close.

4399
02:35:15,720 --> 02:35:15,840
He's not getting close.

4400
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,640
Watch my back.

4401
02:35:16,660 --> 02:35:17,780
What is that in the house?

4402
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:19,560
Yeah, well, three.

4403
02:35:22,460 --> 02:35:23,180
All right.

4404
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:23,620
We're fine.

4405
02:35:23,860 --> 02:35:24,420
I believe.

4406
02:35:25,240 --> 02:35:26,120
Newcastle right here on me.

4407
02:35:27,340 --> 02:35:28,380
I'm behind you.

4408
02:35:29,040 --> 02:35:29,600
Bang one.

4409
02:35:29,700 --> 02:35:30,080
Bang one.

4410
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:31,720
Right here.

4411
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:33,340
Where?

4412
02:35:34,680 --> 02:35:35,220
Newcastle dead.

4413
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:35,940
Valve on me.

4414
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:37,060
Oh, nice.

4415
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:37,160
One is dead.

4416
02:35:37,360 --> 02:35:38,560
That guy was in the smoke there.

4417
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:39,120
Yeah.

4418
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:40,220
I heard him.

4419
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:41,680
Did he run?

4420
02:35:43,280 --> 02:35:43,640
Maybe.

4421
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:44,220
Oh, wait.

4422
02:35:44,240 --> 02:35:44,640
Behind us.

4423
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:45,260
That's another...

4424
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:45,820
Is that another one?

4425
02:35:45,820 --> 02:35:46,160
Is that another Valk?

4426
02:35:47,080 --> 02:35:47,480
Yeah.

4427
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:49,200
But if it's a Valk, it's a different team.

4428
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:49,620
Yeah.

4429
02:35:49,640 --> 02:35:50,360
That's a different Valk.

4430
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,300
Oh, my God.

4431
02:35:52,340 --> 02:35:53,040
I missed every shot.

4432
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:54,020
I cracked him.

4433
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:54,680
I'm batting.

4434
02:35:54,740 --> 02:35:54,900
Oh.

4435
02:35:55,240 --> 02:35:56,000
Oh, no.

4436
02:35:56,420 --> 02:35:57,300
I'm so bad.

4437
02:35:57,560 --> 02:35:58,020
It's okay.

4438
02:35:58,380 --> 02:35:58,920
It's okay.

4439
02:35:58,980 --> 02:35:59,460
You're not pro.

4440
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:00,320
So, like, you can't...

4441
02:36:00,320 --> 02:36:01,660
This is bugged out.

4442
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:05,920
I'm going to grab this for heals later.

4443
02:36:07,220 --> 02:36:07,940
Where are they?

4444
02:36:08,860 --> 02:36:09,860
Are they close to you?

4445
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:10,400
I got one.

4446
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:12,220
Oh, my God.

4447
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:12,940
I got one.

4448
02:36:13,100 --> 02:36:13,520
Dead Valk.

4449
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:15,180
I'm batting.

4450
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:15,800
Dead Valk.

4451
02:36:16,420 --> 02:36:17,800
I thirsted the first guy.

4452
02:36:18,160 --> 02:36:18,520
Wait.

4453
02:36:18,580 --> 02:36:19,160
The next guy is on me.

4454
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:19,980
The last guy is on the bridge.

4455
02:36:20,320 --> 02:36:20,680
Yeah.

4456
02:36:20,680 --> 02:36:20,820
Yeah.

4457
02:36:20,820 --> 02:36:21,200
I'm resing.

4458
02:36:21,220 --> 02:36:21,460
I'm resing.

4459
02:36:21,880 --> 02:36:22,240
Yeah.

4460
02:36:22,360 --> 02:36:23,160
I have the heal.

4461
02:36:24,460 --> 02:36:27,140
His teammate is, like, close to us anyway, so they can't res him.

4462
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:28,460
I...

4463
02:36:28,460 --> 02:36:29,000
Yeah.

4464
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:29,520
I killed him.

4465
02:36:30,860 --> 02:36:31,420
That's right.

4466
02:36:32,020 --> 02:36:33,280
No teammate for you.

4467
02:36:35,540 --> 02:36:36,180
Is he okay?

4468
02:36:36,320 --> 02:36:36,980
I'm not looking.

4469
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:39,400
I'm going to dart to this guy that...

4470
02:36:40,780 --> 02:36:41,780
Oh, my God.

4471
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:42,920
How many times are you going to die?

4472
02:36:44,400 --> 02:36:45,140
I did not...

4473
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:45,480
It's okay.

4474
02:36:45,480 --> 02:36:45,800
I'm not looking.

4475
02:36:46,420 --> 02:36:49,180
I just say RP and I did not help you.

4476
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:49,520
I'm sorry.

4477
02:36:49,940 --> 02:36:50,380
No.

4478
02:36:51,220 --> 02:36:52,860
He had Hammerpoint Mozambique.

4479
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:53,380
This was not...

4480
02:36:53,380 --> 02:36:53,920
Oh, yeah.

4481
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:54,640
That was not...

4482
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:54,940
Yeah.

4483
02:36:55,080 --> 02:36:55,840
We had to use...

4484
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:56,400
He has bait.

4485
02:36:56,560 --> 02:36:56,920
Sorry.

4486
02:36:58,740 --> 02:37:00,380
You were chosen to debate.

4487
02:37:03,360 --> 02:37:06,480
I'm massive as fuck and he has Hammerpoint Mozambique.

4488
02:37:06,820 --> 02:37:07,200
Yeah.

4489
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:07,420
Like...

4490
02:37:07,420 --> 02:37:08,240
He had double...

4491
02:37:08,240 --> 02:37:09,940
Was it double Mozambique or one Mozambique?

4492
02:37:09,980 --> 02:37:11,520
Double Mozambique and Hammerpoint GG.

4493
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:11,840
What the fuck?

4494
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:12,940
How did he get so lucky?

4495
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,500
There's a...

4496
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:16,940
Oh, there's a gold backpack.

4497
02:37:17,540 --> 02:37:19,040
This game is biased as fuck.

4498
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,100
I love Apex.

4499
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:26,940
Okay.

4500
02:37:30,480 --> 02:37:31,600
Why do you want to say that?

4501
02:37:35,420 --> 02:37:38,680
If you don't play it regularly, you start loving it again.

4502
02:37:40,120 --> 02:37:42,080
I love Apex as well.

4503
02:37:42,300 --> 02:37:42,820
Yeah?

4504
02:37:42,960 --> 02:37:45,100
I mean, I haven't played Apex properly in like two years.

4505
02:37:45,660 --> 02:37:46,720
They just res...

4506
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,500
Where?

4507
02:37:47,640 --> 02:37:47,780
Here.

4508
02:37:47,880 --> 02:37:48,020
Oh.

4509
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:48,580
Oh.

4510
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:22,500
I have it so like when I go to the bar, I can just use my license.

4511
02:38:26,500 --> 02:38:29,060
And be like, look, see, I can buy drinks.

4512
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:30,160
Where did he go?

4513
02:38:32,240 --> 02:38:33,280
It's just one guy.

4514
02:38:34,180 --> 02:38:35,220
He's just juking.

4515
02:38:36,260 --> 02:38:37,140
Where's his teammates?

4516
02:38:38,240 --> 02:38:38,920
I don't know.

4517
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,520
Well, this guy's running Scout and Spitfire.

4518
02:38:41,700 --> 02:38:42,960
What a fucking gamer.

4519
02:38:42,960 --> 02:38:43,360
What is he playing?

4520
02:38:44,180 --> 02:38:48,140
Oh, there's Valka and Rocket.

4521
02:38:50,120 --> 02:38:51,380
Oh, what the fuck?

4522
02:38:52,820 --> 02:38:53,920
How did they do that?

4523
02:38:56,820 --> 02:38:58,460
Oh, I see his teammates right here.

4524
02:38:58,800 --> 02:39:00,420
I don't know, but they're gifting us free kills.

4525
02:39:01,540 --> 02:39:02,180
What the?

4526
02:39:04,360 --> 02:39:04,560
Ok.

4527
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:08,760
Oh, wait, I can do this.

4528
02:39:08,860 --> 02:39:09,620
I can smoke here.

4529
02:39:11,580 --> 02:39:11,980
Look.

4530
02:39:12,060 --> 02:39:12,600
Oh my god.

4531
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:12,940
Wait, I'm just trying to my best.

4532
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:12,940
I'm trying to my best just to get my team.

4533
02:39:12,940 --> 02:39:14,160
I'm healing so much in smoke now.

4534
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:15,920
Oh, now I know what... now I get it.

4535
02:39:16,980 --> 02:39:18,320
They actually did buff this.

4536
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:22,580
I can't hit those.

4537
02:39:22,600 --> 02:39:23,420
Should I have one to two?

4538
02:39:25,220 --> 02:39:26,300
Where are they fighting?

4539
02:39:27,300 --> 02:39:28,280
Like at the pyramid.

4540
02:39:28,860 --> 02:39:29,560
Are they still?

4541
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:30,380
We're not going there.

4542
02:39:30,840 --> 02:39:31,780
Yeah, we're not going there.

4543
02:39:31,900 --> 02:39:33,100
I don't want to be in zone, dude.

4544
02:39:33,580 --> 02:39:35,760
They're still literally fighting right there.

4545
02:39:37,800 --> 02:39:39,000
This guy said license.

4546
02:39:39,240 --> 02:39:41,060
Literally just do drink and drive.

4547
02:39:41,260 --> 02:39:42,480
Yeah, great advice, dumbass.

4548
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:42,780
What?

4549
02:39:48,360 --> 02:39:48,840
Yay!

4550
02:39:51,160 --> 02:39:54,520
Sometimes I wonder how people in my chat survive on a daily basis.

4551
02:39:54,820 --> 02:39:56,620
What are you trying to say about your chat?

4552
02:39:56,700 --> 02:39:57,900
Are you trying to say your chat's dumb?

4553
02:39:58,820 --> 02:39:59,300
Yeah.

4554
02:39:59,780 --> 02:40:00,260
Whoa!

4555
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:03,580
Hey, my chat and Besty's chat, you're not dumb.

4556
02:40:04,900 --> 02:40:08,560
Not all of them, but like when you put them together, they're up there, dude.

4557
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:10,700
They're up there as dumbasses.

4558
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:14,700
So you're trying to say the average IQ of your chat is below average.

4559
02:40:15,440 --> 02:40:17,920
No, it's just like when they band together, they're dumb.

4560
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:20,200
They're rezzing.

4561
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:21,440
Send it!

4562
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:25,280
Bro, they're like fucking...

4563
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:27,100
They got it all?

4564
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:31,400
When you put them all together into one cohesive unit, it's fucking bad, dude.

4565
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:35,320
Are we really just waiting for them here?

4566
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:39,120
Yeah, I mean, do you want to go inside the orange shit?

4567
02:40:41,960 --> 02:40:42,580
Oh, no!

4568
02:40:43,780 --> 02:40:45,980
How is there no bats on this map?

4569
02:40:46,940 --> 02:40:48,360
Oh, somebody dyed a ring.

4570
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:48,860
How?

4571
02:40:49,300 --> 02:40:51,720
I'm just going to go loot this because I need bats.

4572
02:40:51,860 --> 02:40:53,980
Yeah, but like, they gotta come over here, right?

4573
02:40:55,340 --> 02:40:56,980
Oh, they could go to the other side.

4574
02:40:57,340 --> 02:40:58,360
You guys do not reflect the streamer.

4575
02:40:58,780 --> 02:40:59,540
Oh, true!

4576
02:40:59,820 --> 02:41:01,320
Chat reflects the streamer!

4577
02:41:01,360 --> 02:41:02,020
That's so true!

4578
02:41:02,580 --> 02:41:04,720
Oh, so you say your chat reflects you?

4579
02:41:04,900 --> 02:41:07,220
No, are you chat... Yeah, that's why I'm saying my chat's smart.

4580
02:41:08,180 --> 02:41:09,960
Yeah, our chat is smart.

4581
02:41:10,040 --> 02:41:11,000
Yeah, our chat's smart.

4582
02:41:11,360 --> 02:41:12,560
Your chat is dumb.

4583
02:41:12,560 --> 02:41:16,700
If you say chat does not reflect the streamer, how would you explain Imperial Hal's chat?

4584
02:41:18,560 --> 02:41:18,960
What?

4585
02:41:19,020 --> 02:41:20,060
What about his chat?

4586
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:23,300
Yeah, I'm just saying his chat is very much like the...

4587
02:41:23,300 --> 02:41:25,320
I'm trying to say his chat is very much like the streamer.

4588
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:29,200
That's all I'm saying.

4589
02:41:29,280 --> 02:41:30,020
What are you trying to imply?

4590
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:31,860
What are you trying to say about his chat?

4591
02:41:31,880 --> 02:41:37,520
I'm just trying to say his chat is very much like his personality and the chat's personality are very similar.

4592
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:38,280
I don't know.

4593
02:41:38,380 --> 02:41:40,300
I don't watch Hal that much anymore.

4594
02:41:40,460 --> 02:41:42,220
I wonder just how does his chat act?

4595
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:44,320
What is it that they do?

4596
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:45,080
They're gamers.

4597
02:41:46,900 --> 02:41:48,040
Because Hal's a gamer.

4598
02:41:48,320 --> 02:41:49,580
Can you be a little bit more specific?

4599
02:41:49,880 --> 02:41:51,260
Hal's a gamer and they're gamers.

4600
02:41:54,160 --> 02:41:55,700
Yeah, what are you trying to imply?

4601
02:41:56,720 --> 02:41:57,820
That's what you meant the entire time.

4602
02:41:58,020 --> 02:41:59,360
Yeah, what are you trying to imply?

4603
02:42:00,020 --> 02:42:01,300
I was just wondering.

4604
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:03,660
They're just as smart as him.

4605
02:42:04,280 --> 02:42:06,720
I haven't managed to watch Hal in a while, so I was just wondering.

4606
02:42:08,420 --> 02:42:09,580
I haven't managed to watch Hal in a while, so I was just wondering.

4607
02:42:09,580 --> 02:42:09,980
I don't hear anything.

4608
02:42:09,980 --> 02:42:11,580
You seem to know so much about his chat.

4609
02:42:12,220 --> 02:42:15,900
Yeah, because I'm just saying that they're pretty smart.

4610
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:17,320
Oh my god.

4611
02:42:17,500 --> 02:42:18,240
We lost one.

4612
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:20,520
I cracked him.

4613
02:42:20,740 --> 02:42:21,840
He's so low though.

4614
02:42:23,160 --> 02:42:24,080
I'm batting.

4615
02:42:24,740 --> 02:42:26,020
I got balled, bro.

4616
02:42:26,280 --> 02:42:27,440
I got balled too.

4617
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:28,800
Oh my god.

4618
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:29,240
Okay.

4619
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:31,180
Okay.

4620
02:42:31,180 --> 02:42:33,300
I'm getting hit by everything.

4621
02:42:33,960 --> 02:42:34,840
Like what?

4622
02:42:35,380 --> 02:42:35,860
Oh my god.

4623
02:42:41,100 --> 02:42:41,900
He's cracked.

4624
02:42:42,080 --> 02:42:43,100
Shoot this guy behind.

4625
02:42:44,260 --> 02:42:44,280
Oh my god.

4626
02:42:44,740 --> 02:42:46,220
What the fuck happened?

4627
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:46,660
What?

4628
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:51,820
What the fuck happened?

4629
02:42:53,520 --> 02:42:54,200
I don't know.

4630
02:42:54,860 --> 02:42:56,140
Our Oak team died.

4631
02:42:56,780 --> 02:42:57,320
Oh it's over.

4632
02:42:57,460 --> 02:43:03,820
I don't think it was your fault.

4633
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:07,200
I think it's our idea for not telling us that there was a team there.

4634
02:43:08,120 --> 02:43:09,340
I think it's our idea for not telling us that there was a team there.

4635
02:43:09,340 --> 02:43:10,000
He takes audio.

4636
02:43:10,220 --> 02:43:11,160
He takes audio.

4637
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:16,200
What the fuck?

4638
02:43:16,220 --> 02:43:17,500
But he has double Mozamm?

4639
02:43:17,600 --> 02:43:18,220
That's not fair!

4640
02:43:18,580 --> 02:43:20,200
I only had one Mozamm!

4641
02:43:21,800 --> 02:43:23,020
He had double Mozamm?

4642
02:43:23,060 --> 02:43:24,300
He only did 56 shots?

4643
02:43:24,400 --> 02:43:25,360
Like 56 damage?

4644
02:43:25,540 --> 02:43:26,500
That's fucking crazy.

4645
02:43:30,460 --> 02:43:31,500
What happened?

4646
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:32,720
What happened?

4647
02:43:33,820 --> 02:43:34,880
What happened?

4648
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:36,820
What happened?

4649
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:40,100
You know, everyone has...

4650
02:43:40,740 --> 02:43:44,140
Everyone has, like, one death, you know?

4651
02:43:44,880 --> 02:43:45,880
One freebie.

4652
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:50,320
I don't die, dude.

4653
02:43:50,960 --> 02:43:53,440
You died... you died second.

4654
02:43:58,700 --> 02:44:00,820
Responsibility of, like, dying first, dying second.

4655
02:44:06,460 --> 02:44:13,020
All I'm saying is that... Based on RPR's logic, like, Doki, you have the lowest ping, so you should carry.

4656
02:44:14,180 --> 02:44:15,180
That is not true.

4657
02:44:15,300 --> 02:44:15,940
That is not true.

4658
02:44:16,060 --> 02:44:16,640
That is true.

4659
02:44:16,680 --> 02:44:18,440
That is a good point, Rustia.

4660
02:44:18,460 --> 02:44:19,100
No, no, no, no.

4661
02:44:19,100 --> 02:44:20,560
That is a good point, Rustia.

4662
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:21,080
Good job.

4663
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:26,180
Because I have the least experience out of all three of us when it comes to Apex.

4664
02:44:26,700 --> 02:44:39,880
So, by that logic, the person with the most experience competitively and in rank should be the one that carries us, because to them, ping doesn't matter that much when you're against plat players.

4665
02:44:40,720 --> 02:44:41,680
Yeah, I saw that.

4666
02:44:41,800 --> 02:44:42,920
I didn't hear a single word you said.

4667
02:44:48,240 --> 02:44:48,680
I didn't hear anything.

4668
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:48,680
Okay, that's nice.

4669
02:44:48,680 --> 02:44:48,960
What happened?

4670
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:50,520
What happened?

4671
02:44:51,400 --> 02:44:52,260
What happened?

4672
02:44:52,580 --> 02:44:54,180
What happened?

4673
02:44:55,200 --> 02:44:56,080
What happened?

4674
02:44:56,980 --> 02:44:59,100
Also, wasn't it in some of the games?

4675
02:44:59,100 --> 02:45:01,100
Like, Rustia and I got the most damage.

4676
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:07,640
You know the point, like, Apex, you just shut up when you have, like...

4677
02:45:07,640 --> 02:45:10,340
You just, like, don't talk about it when you have the least damage.

4678
02:45:11,180 --> 02:45:15,180
Wait, no, Rusty, you had the least damage!

4679
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:16,380
Wait, you're right, Rusty!

4680
02:45:16,520 --> 02:45:18,340
Not that you mentioned it!

4681
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:21,080
Rusty, you had the least damage out of all of us!

4682
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:27,080
And you're higher ranked than me right now!

4683
02:45:29,280 --> 02:45:31,260
Alright, I'll take responsibility of that.

4684
02:45:32,380 --> 02:45:35,400
Is that why Rusty is so quiet lately?

4685
02:45:35,820 --> 02:45:37,420
After every game ending?

4686
02:45:38,760 --> 02:45:41,160
Oh, it was a holy damn match!

4687
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:48,940
I can't believe it, the self-report from Rusty.

4688
02:45:49,400 --> 02:45:51,960
The fucking self-report from Rusty.

4689
02:45:53,700 --> 02:45:59,660
You know what I tend to notice about it when I play with my Pred teammates before?

4690
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:03,780
Every time I die first, I'm like, I'm sorry boys, it's my fault.

4691
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:08,640
And then I see when they're dying first, they're like, Oh, we don't talk about it.

4692
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:09,840
We don't talk about it.

4693
02:46:10,960 --> 02:46:11,660
Those people.

4694
02:46:11,960 --> 02:46:15,460
I have a P20, so I hope we'll be okay.

4695
02:46:18,160 --> 02:46:18,900
Standing over.

4696
02:46:20,240 --> 02:46:20,840
He's one.

4697
02:46:22,340 --> 02:46:23,220
Got him for you.

4698
02:46:24,800 --> 02:46:28,640
This last guy here, or not last guy, but one of the guys here is literally 1 HP.

4699
02:46:28,920 --> 02:46:29,280
Okay.

4700
02:46:29,280 --> 02:46:30,240
He's shooting my knockdown.

4701
02:46:30,640 --> 02:46:31,320
You'll be fine.

4702
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:33,040
Fucking brain to the fuck.

4703
02:46:33,220 --> 02:46:34,060
I had to...

4704
02:46:34,060 --> 02:46:36,020
Wait, what happened?

4705
02:46:37,560 --> 02:46:38,440
What happened?

4706
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:39,840
What happened?

4707
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:42,560
He's right here, by the way, on this door.

4708
02:46:43,060 --> 02:46:43,780
Oh, you...

4709
02:46:45,880 --> 02:46:47,260
Wait, I'm getting shot from behind.

4710
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:52,180
Oh my god, I fucking barrel stuffed that guy.

4711
02:46:54,740 --> 02:46:56,220
Did you grab his banner?

4712
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:57,420
Yeah.

4713
02:46:57,860 --> 02:46:58,680
Alright, that's good.

4714
02:46:59,180 --> 02:46:59,940
That's not on me.

4715
02:47:00,940 --> 02:47:02,500
Oh, last guy is resing.

4716
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:06,340
Where did he go?

4717
02:47:07,180 --> 02:47:10,180
He just low button left him.

4718
02:47:10,300 --> 02:47:12,020
I'm gonna res RPR.

4719
02:47:14,300 --> 02:47:15,380
See, look at that.

4720
02:47:15,440 --> 02:47:16,320
I'm a team player.

4721
02:47:18,080 --> 02:47:19,660
Yeah, great team player.

4722
02:47:20,020 --> 02:47:21,460
Literally, I'm going to res you.

4723
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:23,460
Doing so much teamwork.

4724
02:47:24,520 --> 02:47:25,040
Yeah.

4725
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:27,520
Whoa.

4726
02:47:28,540 --> 02:47:29,060
Yeah.

4727
02:47:29,780 --> 02:47:30,300
Sloppy.

4728
02:47:30,560 --> 02:47:31,720
Upgrades locked and loaded.

4729
02:47:33,520 --> 02:47:34,040
See?

4730
02:47:40,900 --> 02:47:41,800
Look at that.

4731
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:43,720
There we go.

4732
02:47:45,160 --> 02:47:46,180
I did it.

4733
02:47:46,240 --> 02:47:48,060
Good team play, Doki.

4734
02:47:48,240 --> 02:47:48,700
Yeah.

4735
02:47:48,700 --> 02:47:49,020
See?

4736
02:47:49,360 --> 02:47:51,800
Unlike some people, I don't hold grudges.

4737
02:47:53,160 --> 02:47:53,680
Yeah.

4738
02:47:54,300 --> 02:47:56,440
It's like I never res you ever.

4739
02:47:58,440 --> 02:48:00,500
I never res you in my life.

4740
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:02,600
Yeah, because there's always Restia.

4741
02:48:03,440 --> 02:48:05,840
Because Restia knows how to play for the team.

4742
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:06,520
Yeah.

4743
02:48:06,520 --> 02:48:07,460
Yeah, you're right.

4744
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:10,680
Wait, where's Restia?

4745
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:11,200
Where are they?

4746
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:13,160
Inside?

4747
02:48:13,520 --> 02:48:14,260
Two teams?

4748
02:48:14,380 --> 02:48:14,780
Three teams?

4749
02:48:15,060 --> 02:48:15,820
Three teams?

4750
02:48:16,020 --> 02:48:16,700
What the fuck?

4751
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:19,860
I don't have this fucking lag.

4752
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:22,020
Wait, over here?

4753
02:48:22,240 --> 02:48:22,880
Wait, he's climbing up.

4754
02:48:22,940 --> 02:48:23,320
He's climbing up.

4755
02:48:27,580 --> 02:48:28,700
What the fuck?

4756
02:48:29,480 --> 02:48:29,920
I don't know.

4757
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:31,360
I just saw a rev fucking ran.

4758
02:48:31,560 --> 02:48:32,060
Oh, wait.

4759
02:48:32,080 --> 02:48:33,120
They're resing in front of you?

4760
02:48:35,260 --> 02:48:35,660
He's cracked?

4761
02:48:38,360 --> 02:48:39,120
What is he doing?

4762
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:39,540
He's literally one.

4763
02:48:39,580 --> 02:48:40,660
He's literally one outside my door.

4764
02:48:40,660 --> 02:48:40,980
Right here.

4765
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:43,860
He just shoot him outside.

4766
02:48:45,100 --> 02:48:45,540
Okay.

4767
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:46,320
That guy was stupid.

4768
02:48:46,460 --> 02:48:46,700
Okay.

4769
02:48:48,880 --> 02:48:49,320
Toxic.

4770
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:49,980
That's toxic.

4771
02:48:50,060 --> 02:48:55,160
He literally got off the door to throw his fucking mini shield.

4772
02:48:55,720 --> 02:48:57,880
I don't know what the fuck that guy was trying to do.

4773
02:48:58,040 --> 02:49:00,520
What would your chat say when you're toxic like this?

4774
02:49:00,980 --> 02:49:02,420
They're like, wow, Doki.

4775
02:49:02,580 --> 02:49:03,560
You go, girl.

4776
02:49:03,840 --> 02:49:04,520
Girl power.

4777
02:49:05,540 --> 02:49:06,220
Girl boss.

4778
02:49:07,240 --> 02:49:08,920
You can't just fucking eat quick.

4779
02:49:08,980 --> 02:49:09,100
Yeah.

4780
02:49:09,120 --> 02:49:10,280
Girl power.

4781
02:49:10,460 --> 02:49:10,940
Wow.

4782
02:49:11,040 --> 02:49:11,900
What a girl boss.

4783
02:49:12,080 --> 02:49:12,540
Right there.

4784
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:13,280
Let's go.

4785
02:49:15,280 --> 02:49:15,760
Wow.

4786
02:49:15,920 --> 02:49:17,100
Very non-toxic.

4787
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:17,800
Thank you, chat.

4788
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:18,520
I agree.

4789
02:49:20,260 --> 02:49:21,900
She's just making up messages.

4790
02:49:22,360 --> 02:49:24,500
I'm literally looking at my chat right now.

4791
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:30,700
Where's his teammate?

4792
02:49:31,840 --> 02:49:32,780
Oh, right there.

4793
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:35,620
Hey, look.

4794
02:49:35,660 --> 02:49:37,480
He's too busy looting to res you.

4795
02:49:38,020 --> 02:49:38,780
Well, you know.

4796
02:49:38,820 --> 02:49:39,100
He's just...

4797
02:49:39,120 --> 02:49:41,220
First thing you do before you res is armor swap.

4798
02:49:42,140 --> 02:49:45,280
If you believed in your teammates, you wouldn't need armor swap.

4799
02:49:46,820 --> 02:49:48,600
Res was braindead shit you said to me.

4800
02:49:50,940 --> 02:49:53,760
You would believe in me to cover you while you res him.

4801
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:56,560
So you could leave the...

4802
02:49:56,560 --> 02:50:01,700
Why would I put myself at a disadvantage on purpose when I can spend one second looting Because all the teams are dead.

4803
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:06,420
See, I would res you about armor swapping because I am a team player.

4804
02:50:06,700 --> 02:50:07,520
There won't be.

4805
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:07,900
Yeah.

4806
02:50:07,980 --> 02:50:09,920
So you would do a braindead move.

4807
02:50:09,940 --> 02:50:10,620
Good job.

4808
02:50:10,660 --> 02:50:12,980
If that doesn't make you smart, it makes you stupid.

4809
02:50:13,220 --> 02:50:20,040
It makes me a team player that believes in my team with the power of friendship.

4810
02:50:20,100 --> 02:50:25,780
No, it makes you a team player that is sabotaging her own team by not being full health.

4811
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:30,560
A team with the most friendship and belief tends to win land.

4812
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:33,460
That's not true.

4813
02:50:34,940 --> 02:50:35,540
That's true.

4814
02:50:35,620 --> 02:50:36,280
The last one...

4815
02:50:36,280 --> 02:50:36,880
You gotta say that's not true.

4816
02:50:37,520 --> 02:50:40,620
The last land chap literally got kicked out after winning land.

4817
02:50:40,800 --> 02:50:41,780
That's so fucked.

4818
02:50:42,040 --> 02:50:42,820
Holy shit.

4819
02:50:43,580 --> 02:50:46,180
They won land and got kicked out.

4820
02:50:46,700 --> 02:50:48,160
That's actually so fucked.

4821
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:54,100
Didn't he fucking do something to deserve that or some shit?

4822
02:50:54,180 --> 02:50:54,520
I don't know.

4823
02:50:54,700 --> 02:50:55,720
I just know that...

4824
02:50:55,720 --> 02:50:56,860
I don't know what he did.

4825
02:50:56,980 --> 02:50:57,580
What did he do?

4826
02:50:58,260 --> 02:50:59,700
I just saw that like...

4827
02:50:59,700 --> 02:50:59,720
I don't know.

4828
02:50:59,720 --> 02:51:01,280
He was like being toxic and shit apparently.

4829
02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:04,540
I mean, isn't that like Apex players in general?

4830
02:51:05,080 --> 02:51:05,560
Like...

4831
02:51:05,560 --> 02:51:05,880
Yeah.

4832
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:09,200
Yeah, but some people can handle toxicity and others can't.

4833
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:10,620
Oh, I see.

4834
02:51:11,800 --> 02:51:13,040
That's fucked though still.

4835
02:51:13,280 --> 02:51:15,440
I feel like, you know, he should be in the...

4836
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:19,300
I think it's stupid to be toxic to your teammates because you're equal.

4837
02:51:19,440 --> 02:51:22,960
Like you instantly make an environment in which your teammate doesn't want to team with you anymore.

4838
02:51:23,180 --> 02:51:23,360
Yeah.

4839
02:51:23,400 --> 02:51:26,160
To the point that you get kicked out after winning.

4840
02:51:26,260 --> 02:51:28,020
You're making a team for like what?

4841
02:51:28,100 --> 02:51:28,600
One land?

4842
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:32,740
And then you're definitely making a roster swap because everyone hates you now because you're toxic to them.

4843
02:51:32,860 --> 02:51:32,960
Yeah.

4844
02:51:33,400 --> 02:51:34,280
One of like...

4845
02:51:34,280 --> 02:51:39,900
I like how you did with like, you know, like Manne and Ty'shin.

4846
02:51:40,300 --> 02:51:40,880
Like you...

4847
02:51:40,880 --> 02:51:44,000
It just went well and then you don't, don't talk about it.

4848
02:51:44,060 --> 02:51:45,460
Just like, okay, we'll play next time.

4849
02:51:45,680 --> 02:51:45,880
Oh...

4850
02:51:45,880 --> 02:51:47,880
Okay, don't worry.

4851
02:51:48,000 --> 02:51:49,980
I'm gonna- Especially during like LAN.

4852
02:51:50,080 --> 02:51:50,840
Why would you argue?

4853
02:51:51,440 --> 02:51:53,460
Wait, were they arguing in LAN too?

4854
02:51:54,700 --> 02:51:55,960
Yeah, they were arguing all the time.

4855
02:51:56,080 --> 02:51:56,600
Their NA.

4856
02:51:56,740 --> 02:51:58,060
Oh, that's true.

4857
02:51:58,480 --> 02:51:59,980
Okay, I got this guy.

4858
02:51:59,980 --> 02:52:00,100
Yeah.

4859
02:52:00,260 --> 02:52:01,140
More from behind.

4860
02:52:02,660 --> 02:52:04,400
Don't let them rez, that was my kill.

4861
02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:05,620
Yeah, that was the worst.

4862
02:52:05,720 --> 02:52:08,480
The worst thing pro players do is the passive-aggressive shit.

4863
02:52:08,640 --> 02:52:09,680
Oh yeah, I hate that shit.

4864
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:10,320
Yeah, you're right.

4865
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,120
NA players do that shit all the fucking time.

4866
02:52:14,120 --> 02:52:14,760
It's so annoying.

4867
02:52:15,180 --> 02:52:16,500
It's so childish as well.

4868
02:52:17,520 --> 02:52:18,860
Yeah, just say it to their face.

4869
02:52:20,200 --> 02:52:21,020
Don't need to do the...

4870
02:52:21,020 --> 02:52:23,100
It's like, dude, do you have something to say?

4871
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:23,940
Just fucking say it, bro.

4872
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:24,520
Like, what are you doing?

4873
02:52:25,060 --> 02:52:25,760
I cracked one.

4874
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:28,200
I was reloading second kill.

4875
02:52:28,200 --> 02:52:28,880
I'm ulting.

4876
02:52:29,140 --> 02:52:30,500
And I want... yeah, it's a new team.

4877
02:52:30,520 --> 02:52:30,840
Just two more.

4878
02:52:30,940 --> 02:52:31,680
They all went back.

4879
02:52:31,900 --> 02:52:32,220
Yeah.

4880
02:52:32,400 --> 02:52:33,600
Oh, they all went back?

4881
02:52:33,980 --> 02:52:34,780
In the portal?

4882
02:52:35,020 --> 02:52:36,280
All went back to the portal, yeah.

4883
02:52:36,320 --> 02:52:36,680
Oh, okay.

4884
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:37,800
So my ult is...

4885
02:52:37,800 --> 02:52:39,260
Thank you for ulting.

4886
02:52:40,280 --> 02:52:41,640
No worries, guys.

4887
02:52:41,820 --> 02:52:42,420
No worries.

4888
02:52:42,500 --> 02:52:43,580
Just for you guys.

4889
02:52:45,500 --> 02:52:46,740
I don't think they're coming back.

4890
02:52:46,820 --> 02:52:48,940
I think that's my biggest pet peeve with like...

4891
02:52:50,020 --> 02:52:51,200
pro players that...

4892
02:52:52,660 --> 02:52:54,400
They're such children sometimes.

4893
02:52:54,620 --> 02:52:55,520
It's so annoying.

4894
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:58,100
A lot of pro players are incredibly young.

4895
02:52:58,120 --> 02:52:58,180
And they're actually like...

4896
02:52:58,200 --> 02:52:58,380
They're young, though.

4897
02:52:58,920 --> 02:52:59,640
Yeah, they're young.

4898
02:52:59,660 --> 02:52:59,820
Yeah.

4899
02:52:59,840 --> 02:53:00,420
But like...

4900
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:02,820
I don't give a fuck how young you are.

4901
02:53:02,840 --> 02:53:04,680
Why are you being passive aggressive to your teammates?

4902
02:53:04,760 --> 02:53:05,600
Like, if there's an issue...

4903
02:53:05,600 --> 02:53:07,220
Because they treat it like it's high school.

4904
02:53:07,280 --> 02:53:08,120
You can just fucking speak about it.

4905
02:53:08,140 --> 02:53:11,040
If you just speak about it, we can solve the issue.

4906
02:53:11,180 --> 02:53:14,600
If you're just fucking being a little bitch, we can't fucking solve shit, man.

4907
02:53:15,540 --> 02:53:17,180
It's because like a lot of like...

4908
02:53:17,180 --> 02:53:20,120
Especially pro players, they started out like super young becoming pro.

4909
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:22,560
And because of that, they like treat it like it's high school.

4910
02:53:22,980 --> 02:53:24,820
And it's like an ego thing, too.

4911
02:53:26,160 --> 02:53:27,380
I don't know, but it's annoying.

4912
02:53:27,380 --> 02:53:31,840
And a lot of teams that should be teams literally disband because they're children.

4913
02:53:32,120 --> 02:53:33,780
You think they'll kill me from this zip?

4914
02:53:34,280 --> 02:53:35,240
Guys, I think...

4915
02:53:35,240 --> 02:53:35,600
No.

4916
02:53:35,600 --> 02:53:35,780
Guys.

4917
02:53:36,300 --> 02:53:36,520
No.

4918
02:53:37,060 --> 02:53:37,780
Guys, I'm...

4919
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:39,760
But they'll kill you at the end of the zip.

4920
02:53:40,440 --> 02:53:42,460
Yeah, so I'm fucking dropping off now.

4921
02:53:42,660 --> 02:53:43,060
Kill the revenant.

4922
02:53:43,100 --> 02:53:43,480
Kill the revenant.

4923
02:53:43,700 --> 02:53:44,140
Whoa.

4924
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:46,140
The shield's broken.

4925
02:53:47,280 --> 02:53:47,980
He's one.

4926
02:53:51,060 --> 02:53:52,120
He's literally one.

4927
02:53:52,140 --> 02:53:53,000
I can't touch him.

4928
02:53:53,600 --> 02:53:54,100
All right.

4929
02:53:54,120 --> 02:53:54,800
I'm going up.

4930
02:53:55,860 --> 02:53:56,520
He's jumping somewhere.

4931
02:53:56,520 --> 02:53:56,760
I believe.

4932
02:53:57,060 --> 02:53:58,360
Oh, he got the zip.

4933
02:53:58,400 --> 02:53:59,880
He's using his Pathfinder zip.

4934
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:03,920
I can't kill him.

4935
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:05,300
He's fucking...

4936
02:54:05,300 --> 02:54:06,320
I can't even see him.

4937
02:54:06,380 --> 02:54:08,260
He's like a little speck on my screen.

4938
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:12,380
We could kill this.

4939
02:54:12,540 --> 02:54:13,360
Yeah, let's do it.

4940
02:54:13,460 --> 02:54:14,120
Famous last words.

4941
02:54:14,400 --> 02:54:15,180
What, behind me?

4942
02:54:15,220 --> 02:54:15,860
Oh, whoa, whoa.

4943
02:54:17,100 --> 02:54:18,300
We need to save Restia.

4944
02:54:18,860 --> 02:54:19,880
Oh, my God.

4945
02:54:20,120 --> 02:54:20,480
Are they...

4946
02:54:20,480 --> 02:54:20,960
Oh, they're...

4947
02:54:20,960 --> 02:54:22,240
Yeah, full team, full team, full team.

4948
02:54:22,700 --> 02:54:23,160
Yeah, wait.

4949
02:54:23,200 --> 02:54:23,680
Just let him die.

4950
02:54:23,700 --> 02:54:23,960
Let him die.

4951
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:24,200
Let him die.

4952
02:54:24,300 --> 02:54:24,380
Let him die.

4953
02:54:25,320 --> 02:54:26,560
Well, I'm going to die too.

4954
02:54:27,400 --> 02:54:27,760
Okay.

4955
02:54:28,380 --> 02:54:28,860
Don't worry.

4956
02:54:29,020 --> 02:54:29,120
I'm...

4957
02:54:29,120 --> 02:54:29,960
Just run if you can.

4958
02:54:30,080 --> 02:54:30,680
I'm running.

4959
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:31,220
I'm running.

4960
02:54:31,260 --> 02:54:31,680
I'm running.

4961
02:54:31,760 --> 02:54:33,160
But he has hammer point.

4962
02:54:33,220 --> 02:54:34,160
I felt the hammers.

4963
02:54:35,260 --> 02:54:35,620
Okay.

4964
02:54:38,300 --> 02:54:40,180
Oh, well, thank you for the speed boost.

4965
02:54:40,760 --> 02:54:41,120
Whoa.

4966
02:54:41,280 --> 02:54:41,860
Hey, guys.

4967
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:44,640
Oh, goodbye.

4968
02:54:47,560 --> 02:54:48,060
Res him.

4969
02:54:48,180 --> 02:54:49,040
It'll be so funny.

4970
02:54:51,220 --> 02:54:52,000
They're on us.

4971
02:54:52,020 --> 02:54:52,720
What the fuck?

4972
02:54:52,740 --> 02:54:53,640
No one here at all.

4973
02:54:53,640 --> 02:54:53,920
I'm dead.

4974
02:54:53,920 --> 02:54:53,940
I'm dead.

4975
02:54:53,940 --> 02:54:55,140
Oh, no.

4976
02:54:55,780 --> 02:54:56,660
That's how I died.

4977
02:54:57,780 --> 02:54:58,500
That's how I died.

4978
02:54:58,500 --> 02:54:59,420
No audio on this guy.

4979
02:54:59,920 --> 02:55:01,460
That's literally how it happened.

4980
02:55:02,440 --> 02:55:04,700
You should know about like the new season, right?

4981
02:55:04,760 --> 02:55:11,340
Like the characters with cyber legs, like Pathfinder, Octane, or like Rift.

4982
02:55:11,340 --> 02:55:11,660
Wait, really?

4983
02:55:13,460 --> 02:55:14,080
That's fucked.

4984
02:55:15,460 --> 02:55:17,540
That's been happening for months now.

4985
02:55:17,600 --> 02:55:18,660
So it's just like...

4986
02:55:18,660 --> 02:55:19,740
Well, I can craft you here.

4987
02:55:19,960 --> 02:55:19,980
What's new?

4988
02:55:21,520 --> 02:55:21,920
Yeah.

4989
02:55:22,260 --> 02:55:23,380
Well, you have his banner.

4990
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:23,920
You just have to craft it.

4991
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:24,440
Yeah.

4992
02:55:24,580 --> 02:55:24,600
Yeah.

4993
02:55:24,680 --> 02:55:25,640
But I have to craft you too.

4994
02:55:28,220 --> 02:55:28,780
That's fine.

4995
02:55:32,970 --> 02:55:33,290
Whoa.

4996
02:55:35,270 --> 02:55:36,270
Wait, do I not have...

4997
02:55:36,270 --> 02:55:36,650
Oh, I forgot.

4998
02:55:36,790 --> 02:55:36,950
Oh, wait.

4999
02:55:36,970 --> 02:55:37,210
No, I do.

5000
02:55:37,350 --> 02:55:38,910
I was going to say, do I not have it?

5001
02:55:39,830 --> 02:55:41,490
There's no way I get shot here, right?

5002
02:55:42,910 --> 02:55:43,710
No, I don't see...

5003
02:55:43,710 --> 02:55:44,330
Oh, they're over there.

5004
02:55:45,350 --> 02:55:46,530
They're literally over there watching it.

5005
02:55:46,530 --> 02:55:48,810
Like to fucking zoom out a little bit and just...

5006
02:55:49,270 --> 02:55:50,510
This is going to be zone three.

5007
02:55:50,590 --> 02:55:51,070
So you can...

5008
02:55:51,070 --> 02:55:52,810
And it's not going to touch the respawn beacon.

5009
02:55:52,850 --> 02:55:53,550
You're going to be able to see.

5010
02:55:53,590 --> 02:55:54,150
Never mind.

5011
02:55:54,230 --> 02:55:54,550
Okay.

5012
02:55:55,070 --> 02:55:55,390
Okay.

5013
02:55:55,390 --> 02:55:55,530
Okay.

5014
02:55:55,530 --> 02:55:55,650
Okay.

5015
02:55:58,130 --> 02:55:59,610
They saw me, guys.

5016
02:56:00,350 --> 02:56:01,690
How did they see me?

5017
02:56:01,730 --> 02:56:02,390
I don't understand.

5018
02:56:02,650 --> 02:56:02,950
I was...

5019
02:56:02,950 --> 02:56:04,730
Bro, why the fuck are you trying to hammer point?

5020
02:56:05,330 --> 02:56:10,550
Do you know that in the latest patch, they made a patch note saying that they fixed audio?

5021
02:56:11,290 --> 02:56:11,990
Oh, yeah.

5022
02:56:11,990 --> 02:56:12,450
I remember.

5023
02:56:12,830 --> 02:56:13,330
Yeah.

5024
02:56:13,370 --> 02:56:13,690
Yeah.

5025
02:56:13,850 --> 02:56:17,590
They especially fixed the audio around footsteps specifically.

5026
02:56:18,290 --> 02:56:19,130
That's what they said.

5027
02:56:19,250 --> 02:56:19,730
What the fuck?

5028
02:56:19,850 --> 02:56:20,330
How they...

5029
02:56:20,330 --> 02:56:23,390
Why are they still chasing me?

5030
02:56:23,890 --> 02:56:24,970
Fucking free.

5031
02:56:25,170 --> 02:56:25,650
Yeah.

5032
02:56:31,530 --> 02:56:32,470
Oh, my God.

5033
02:56:32,610 --> 02:56:33,410
Where's the other team?

5034
02:56:33,410 --> 02:56:33,430
Yeah.

5035
02:56:33,430 --> 02:56:34,490
Well, anyway, that was a fucking lie.

5036
02:56:34,770 --> 02:56:37,330
Where the fuck is the other team?

5037
02:56:38,570 --> 02:56:39,170
There we go.

5038
02:56:39,270 --> 02:56:39,650
I don't know, but...

5039
02:56:39,650 --> 02:56:40,450
Fucking run.

5040
02:56:40,710 --> 02:56:41,690
I'm trying to.

5041
02:56:43,110 --> 02:56:43,670
All right.

5042
02:56:43,830 --> 02:56:44,230
Nice.

5043
02:56:48,470 --> 02:56:49,070
All right.

5044
02:56:49,090 --> 02:56:49,930
Do you think they're...

5045
02:56:49,930 --> 02:56:55,850
If they're going to still chase you, just go towards the other team so they end up dying for chasing you.

5046
02:56:56,170 --> 02:56:56,570
Yeah.

5047
02:56:56,590 --> 02:56:56,790
They are.

5048
02:56:56,830 --> 02:56:56,990
They are.

5049
02:56:56,990 --> 02:56:57,310
They're dying.

5050
02:56:57,370 --> 02:56:57,590
They're dying.

5051
02:56:57,590 --> 02:56:58,450
They're literally dying for it.

5052
02:56:59,250 --> 02:56:59,970
They're literally...

5053
02:56:59,970 --> 02:57:00,110
Okay.

5054
02:57:00,110 --> 02:57:01,030
Now go res us to the left.

5055
02:57:01,070 --> 02:57:01,270
Okay.

5056
02:57:01,290 --> 02:57:01,690
Yeah.

5057
02:57:01,690 --> 02:57:01,770
Yeah.

5058
02:57:02,050 --> 02:57:04,150
They literally are dying because of it.

5059
02:57:04,210 --> 02:57:05,110
Holy fuck.

5060
02:57:05,190 --> 02:57:05,850
That was cringe.

5061
02:57:09,240 --> 02:57:09,820
Let's go.

5062
02:57:10,700 --> 02:57:11,220
Let's go.

5063
02:57:11,240 --> 02:57:12,860
It's so funny that they wrote...

5064
02:57:12,860 --> 02:57:15,800
They fixed audio specifically footsteps.

5065
02:57:17,080 --> 02:57:17,820
That's not good.

5066
02:57:18,340 --> 02:57:20,900
And then half the characters have no abilities.

5067
02:57:21,420 --> 02:57:21,680
What?

5068
02:57:22,560 --> 02:57:23,060
Okay.

5069
02:57:23,140 --> 02:57:23,340
I'm dead.

5070
02:57:24,140 --> 02:57:24,640
Okay.

5071
02:57:25,800 --> 02:57:26,760
Oh, my God.

5072
02:57:26,820 --> 02:57:28,080
I got killed by pure Halo.

5073
02:57:29,820 --> 02:57:32,640
Oh, my God.

5074
02:57:32,660 --> 02:57:33,720
What the fuck?

5075
02:57:34,060 --> 02:57:35,800
They saw me from there?

5076
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:36,960
F-O-C-N Imperial Halo.

5077
02:57:37,360 --> 02:57:37,380
Yeah.

5078
02:57:40,660 --> 02:57:42,600
Without Imperial Halo.

5079
02:57:42,940 --> 02:57:43,460
Let's go.

5080
02:57:43,460 --> 02:57:43,760
Oh, my God.

5081
02:57:43,820 --> 02:57:44,920
I can't believe it.

5082
02:57:45,400 --> 02:57:49,720
I can't believe I got killed by Imperial Halo.

5083
02:57:52,040 --> 02:57:53,360
The motherfucking goat.

5084
02:57:53,820 --> 02:57:54,820
Holy shit.

5085
02:57:54,860 --> 02:57:55,480
He's gaming.

5086
02:57:56,400 --> 02:57:57,740
I can't believe...

5087
02:57:57,740 --> 02:57:59,440
At least the team that chased us died.

5088
02:57:59,980 --> 02:58:00,860
I hope.

5089
02:58:00,880 --> 02:58:01,400
I think.

5090
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:02,640
I think.

5091
02:58:04,200 --> 02:58:05,040
They just...

5092
02:58:05,040 --> 02:58:06,020
They look like they died.

5093
02:58:06,160 --> 02:58:06,320
I don't know.

5094
02:58:07,460 --> 02:58:09,140
I like when teams do that in ranked.

5095
02:58:09,220 --> 02:58:09,860
They never learn.

5096
02:58:09,960 --> 02:58:11,860
They just chase us all and die because of it.

5097
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:12,300
Yeah.

5098
02:58:12,320 --> 02:58:13,360
Because they got greedy.

5099
02:58:14,660 --> 02:58:17,640
They're just like, this one KP in my plat game.

5100
02:58:24,330 --> 02:58:24,770
Yippee.

5101
02:58:25,330 --> 02:58:25,770
Guys.

5102
02:58:25,870 --> 02:58:26,250
I think...

5103
02:58:26,250 --> 02:58:26,590
Guys.

5104
02:58:27,710 --> 02:58:30,330
I believe in us in winning one plat game.

5105
02:58:30,470 --> 02:58:31,550
That should be our goal.

5106
02:58:34,190 --> 02:58:35,070
That is...

5107
02:58:35,070 --> 02:58:35,490
That is...

5108
02:58:35,490 --> 02:58:36,590
I mean, we were close.

5109
02:58:36,630 --> 02:58:37,010
Like, what?

5110
02:58:37,010 --> 02:58:37,170
We were close.

5111
02:58:38,810 --> 02:58:39,290
We were close.

5112
02:58:39,290 --> 02:58:40,290
I believe in us.

5113
02:58:40,330 --> 02:58:41,710
It can't be that difficult.

5114
02:58:42,110 --> 02:58:42,310
We can...

5115
02:58:42,310 --> 02:58:43,850
As long as Resti doesn't die, we're good.

5116
02:58:43,890 --> 02:58:44,370
That's true.

5117
02:58:44,790 --> 02:58:46,250
I mean, if we die...

5118
02:58:46,250 --> 02:58:49,910
We die twice because of it.

5119
02:58:53,810 --> 02:58:54,290
Maybe...

5120
02:58:55,650 --> 02:58:57,190
You just need to be pathfinder.

5121
02:58:57,530 --> 02:58:58,330
Oh, you're...

5122
02:58:58,330 --> 02:59:02,930
If you're pathfinder, then you can be the person that sneaks up onto others.

5123
02:59:03,250 --> 02:59:04,790
Oh, I'm playing serious this game.

5124
02:59:04,930 --> 02:59:06,710
I don't know how to play serious.

5125
02:59:06,710 --> 02:59:06,750
Oh, you weren't playing serious?

5126
02:59:06,750 --> 02:59:08,390
Serious in the plot?

5127
02:59:09,050 --> 02:59:10,650
No, I wasn't.

5128
02:59:10,810 --> 02:59:12,370
This guy never plays serious.

5129
02:59:12,410 --> 02:59:13,610
He doesn't play serious in bronze.

5130
02:59:13,770 --> 02:59:14,810
He doesn't play serious in soul.

5131
02:59:14,910 --> 02:59:16,050
He doesn't play serious in the plot.

5132
02:59:16,270 --> 02:59:17,310
Where are you going to play serious then?

5133
02:59:17,310 --> 02:59:18,890
When will you start being serious?

5134
02:59:21,430 --> 02:59:23,190
It's just excuse Andy, bro.

5135
02:59:23,410 --> 02:59:23,650
Wow.

5136
02:59:24,890 --> 02:59:25,610
That's not true.

5137
02:59:26,430 --> 02:59:27,470
Prove me wrong then.

5138
02:59:27,750 --> 02:59:30,230
Yeah, prove him wrong by being serious now.

5139
02:59:32,350 --> 02:59:36,350
If you're not top fragger, Restia, then you're not serious.

5140
02:59:37,170 --> 02:59:38,270
Alright, I'm serious.

5141
02:59:38,490 --> 02:59:39,650
Serious mode, let's go.

5142
02:59:39,850 --> 02:59:41,530
Oh, he's serious now, guys.

5143
02:59:41,710 --> 02:59:43,170
He's going to be top fragger.

5144
02:59:43,390 --> 02:59:44,430
Let's see what serious Restia can do.

5145
02:59:44,690 --> 02:59:46,050
Yeah, yeah, let's see, yeah, yeah.

5146
02:59:46,070 --> 02:59:47,350
Are you guys scanning the zone in front of me?

5147
02:59:49,190 --> 02:59:50,970
This caustic is a joke.

5148
02:59:52,270 --> 02:59:53,510
I can't see him.

5149
02:59:53,830 --> 02:59:54,650
Oh, he's dead.

5150
02:59:54,830 --> 02:59:56,330
He tried to scan zone.

5151
02:59:56,890 --> 02:59:57,790
What the fuck?

5152
02:59:57,790 --> 02:59:58,510
He's literally...

5153
02:59:58,510 --> 02:59:59,170
This guy's...

5154
02:59:59,170 --> 03:00:02,130
Crypto right here, also a questionable moment.

5155
03:00:02,930 --> 03:00:04,770
I have to cock the gun again.

5156
03:00:04,770 --> 03:00:05,870
Why did you bring this Crypto?

5157
03:00:05,910 --> 03:00:06,330
Because I don't know.

5158
03:00:07,190 --> 03:00:07,590
He's so serious.

5159
03:00:07,590 --> 03:00:08,630
I just got three Norex on him.

5160
03:00:08,670 --> 03:00:10,330
Oh my god, Restia's so serious.

5161
03:00:10,410 --> 03:00:10,750
Look at this.

5162
03:00:10,910 --> 03:00:12,010
Yep, was so serious.

5163
03:00:12,010 --> 03:00:12,590
Did you hear that?

5164
03:00:14,530 --> 03:00:17,370
Why did that caustic go for fucking zone scan?

5165
03:00:17,610 --> 03:00:18,650
Right in front of him.

5166
03:00:18,670 --> 03:00:20,390
He wanted the charge, the ult charge.

5167
03:00:20,630 --> 03:00:22,930
He's so serious that he's controller looting too.

5168
03:00:24,030 --> 03:00:24,990
Wait, are you a controller?

5169
03:00:25,250 --> 03:00:25,390
Yeah.

5170
03:00:25,970 --> 03:00:27,310
I know, I saw it.

5171
03:00:27,510 --> 03:00:28,410
Stan's still looting.

5172
03:00:29,230 --> 03:00:30,790
Don't tell me you switched to controller.

5173
03:00:31,370 --> 03:00:32,810
No, no, no, I don't.

5174
03:00:33,550 --> 03:00:34,450
I hate controller.

5175
03:00:34,810 --> 03:00:35,130
Okay.

5176
03:00:36,330 --> 03:00:38,030
You get minus one friendship if you switched.

5177
03:00:38,330 --> 03:00:41,930
Yeah, that's how Serious plugs in the controller.

5178
03:00:46,050 --> 03:00:47,470
I think they're fighting here, man.

5179
03:00:47,910 --> 03:00:49,250
Yeah, they're heading over.

5180
03:00:51,030 --> 03:00:51,830
Like right here.

5181
03:00:51,930 --> 03:00:52,530
All right.

5182
03:00:53,150 --> 03:00:54,370
I'm heading over.

5183
03:00:55,230 --> 03:00:56,050
They're fighting here now.

5184
03:00:57,570 --> 03:00:58,750
Oh, I'm grabbing some.

5185
03:00:58,750 --> 03:01:02,150
We should first clean up our POI, Restia, before we go to other POIs.

5186
03:01:02,350 --> 03:01:03,930
Look, he's serious.

5187
03:01:04,130 --> 03:01:04,970
He's got 1v3.

5188
03:01:05,150 --> 03:01:05,610
He's serious.

5189
03:01:06,330 --> 03:01:06,790
He can 1v3.

5190
03:01:06,930 --> 03:01:07,830
They'll kill these guys.

5191
03:01:07,910 --> 03:01:08,250
All right.

5192
03:01:08,890 --> 03:01:09,670
I'm heading over.

5193
03:01:09,790 --> 03:01:10,990
I'm here to help you, RPRC.

5194
03:01:12,390 --> 03:01:12,970
I'm a team.

5195
03:01:13,030 --> 03:01:13,570
They're in this building.

5196
03:01:13,870 --> 03:01:15,350
Or they were in this building, at least.

5197
03:01:16,890 --> 03:01:17,770
Where are they now?

5198
03:01:18,070 --> 03:01:18,530
It's a Watson.

5199
03:01:18,950 --> 03:01:19,590
Oh, I see him.

5200
03:01:20,750 --> 03:01:22,090
They're running right side.

5201
03:01:23,750 --> 03:01:25,150
Are you okay over there, Restia?

5202
03:01:25,750 --> 03:01:26,110
Yeah.

5203
03:01:27,610 --> 03:01:28,310
He's serious.

5204
03:01:28,410 --> 03:01:28,810
He's okay.

5205
03:01:29,190 --> 03:01:29,550
Okay.

5206
03:01:29,570 --> 03:01:30,550
They're running up the hill.

5207
03:01:30,750 --> 03:01:30,810
Oh, he wants you in the building.

5208
03:01:30,810 --> 03:01:31,330
He wants you in the building.

5209
03:01:31,650 --> 03:01:31,990
Okay.

5210
03:01:32,150 --> 03:01:32,530
I'm looking.

5211
03:01:35,510 --> 03:01:36,250
Is he still?

5212
03:01:36,250 --> 03:01:36,310
Yeah.

5213
03:01:36,310 --> 03:01:37,430
Oh, okay.

5214
03:01:37,710 --> 03:01:39,870
The other guy is probably a resin teammate because there's...

5215
03:01:39,870 --> 03:01:40,190
Yeah.

5216
03:01:40,190 --> 03:01:40,670
No, they are.

5217
03:01:41,090 --> 03:01:42,150
They smoked it.

5218
03:01:42,290 --> 03:01:42,630
Wait.

5219
03:01:43,030 --> 03:01:44,450
Oh, I thought you were going to...

5220
03:01:44,450 --> 03:01:45,890
I thought you were flanking the rest.

5221
03:01:45,970 --> 03:01:46,130
Yeah.

5222
03:01:46,170 --> 03:01:46,690
But don't worry.

5223
03:01:46,770 --> 03:01:47,230
We got this.

5224
03:01:50,880 --> 03:01:51,280
Oh.

5225
03:01:52,680 --> 03:01:53,900
Where is he running to?

5226
03:01:54,060 --> 03:01:54,320
Whoa.

5227
03:01:54,360 --> 03:01:55,160
He's tap strafing.

5228
03:01:58,180 --> 03:01:59,000
That's a rampart.

5229
03:01:59,700 --> 03:02:00,300
On top.

5230
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:03,280
Whoa.

5231
03:02:03,420 --> 03:02:03,580
Look.

5232
03:02:03,640 --> 03:02:04,180
Do a finisher.

5233
03:02:05,580 --> 03:02:06,400
Where's the last guy?

5234
03:02:06,520 --> 03:02:07,140
Do a finisher?

5235
03:02:07,160 --> 03:02:07,360
Yeah.

5236
03:02:07,360 --> 03:02:07,660
Okay.

5237
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:08,060
Yeah.

5238
03:02:08,560 --> 03:02:09,560
He ran that way.

5239
03:02:09,560 --> 03:02:11,220
He was tap strafing that way.

5240
03:02:12,340 --> 03:02:12,740
Yeah.

5241
03:02:12,740 --> 03:02:12,900
Yeah.

5242
03:02:13,300 --> 03:02:14,240
He was tap strafing that way.

5243
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:14,720
Yeah.

5244
03:02:14,740 --> 03:02:15,520
He was tap strafing.

5245
03:02:15,540 --> 03:02:16,200
He was.

5246
03:02:16,220 --> 03:02:19,340
I was literally watching him dodge my bullets and tap strafing.

5247
03:02:19,780 --> 03:02:20,600
I was like, whoa.

5248
03:02:23,640 --> 03:02:24,560
Where's the other team?

5249
03:02:24,600 --> 03:02:25,680
Which character was it?

5250
03:02:25,780 --> 03:02:26,800
It was a Bangalore.

5251
03:02:27,060 --> 03:02:27,460
Bangalore.

5252
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:28,520
Bangalore.

5253
03:02:29,620 --> 03:02:30,620
Where could they be?

5254
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:32,060
Where the fuck did he go?

5255
03:02:32,060 --> 03:02:32,680
Oh, team here.

5256
03:02:32,700 --> 03:02:32,980
Team here.

5257
03:02:33,960 --> 03:02:34,620
Let's kill them.

5258
03:02:35,020 --> 03:02:35,800
In front of me.

5259
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:36,240
Whoa.

5260
03:02:36,280 --> 03:02:37,660
He tried to snipe me in the air.

5261
03:02:37,660 --> 03:02:38,660
What a gamer.

5262
03:02:38,940 --> 03:02:40,060
I only see one guy.

5263
03:02:40,160 --> 03:02:40,680
Where do you see team?

5264
03:02:41,480 --> 03:02:42,140
One's on the roof.

5265
03:02:42,980 --> 03:02:43,340
Wait.

5266
03:02:43,360 --> 03:02:43,480
Wait.

5267
03:02:43,500 --> 03:02:43,640
He's one.

5268
03:02:43,700 --> 03:02:43,920
He's one.

5269
03:02:43,920 --> 03:02:44,160
On the roof.

5270
03:02:44,220 --> 03:02:44,520
On HP.

5271
03:02:44,680 --> 03:02:45,000
Okay.

5272
03:02:45,100 --> 03:02:45,720
Goodbye, guys.

5273
03:02:47,500 --> 03:02:47,860
Goodbye.

5274
03:02:47,960 --> 03:02:49,440
I got 2v1.

5275
03:02:49,720 --> 03:02:50,660
Which one is one?

5276
03:02:51,220 --> 03:02:51,940
The seer.

5277
03:02:51,980 --> 03:02:52,280
The seer.

5278
03:02:52,320 --> 03:02:52,620
The seer.

5279
03:02:52,740 --> 03:02:53,700
The seer that's on me.

5280
03:02:53,740 --> 03:02:54,240
He's got armor swap.

5281
03:02:55,680 --> 03:02:56,320
There's two here.

5282
03:02:57,780 --> 03:02:58,140
Inside.

5283
03:02:58,200 --> 03:02:59,260
They have a lifeline as well.

5284
03:02:59,400 --> 03:03:00,460
So he's going to be full healed.

5285
03:03:02,180 --> 03:03:03,360
I can't believe it.

5286
03:03:03,660 --> 03:03:04,060
It's okay.

5287
03:03:04,060 --> 03:03:04,980
Someone's landing on us.

5288
03:03:05,140 --> 03:03:05,880
Restia, new team.

5289
03:03:06,220 --> 03:03:06,580
Okay.

5290
03:03:06,600 --> 03:03:06,940
Restia.

5291
03:03:07,700 --> 03:03:08,140
Restia.

5292
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:10,580
Restia.

5293
03:03:10,580 --> 03:03:10,620
Restia.

5294
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:11,480
Restia.

5295
03:03:11,480 --> 03:03:11,520
Okay.

5296
03:03:11,520 --> 03:03:13,060
I killed one team.

5297
03:03:13,060 --> 03:03:13,980
I killed one from new team.

5298
03:03:14,160 --> 03:03:16,600
There's no Audio Newcastle on me then.

5299
03:03:16,840 --> 03:03:17,780
Where is his metal legs?

5300
03:03:17,820 --> 03:03:18,540
What the .

5301
03:03:21,280 --> 03:03:22,380
But I thought they fixed.

5302
03:03:22,860 --> 03:03:23,620
Go to the juicer.

5303
03:03:23,860 --> 03:03:23,900
Go there.

5304
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:24,700
Oh yeah.

5305
03:03:24,820 --> 03:03:25,260
Yeah, I'm doing it.

5306
03:03:25,720 --> 03:03:27,820
I thought the, these guys said they fixed the audio.

5307
03:03:28,040 --> 03:03:28,420
What happened?

5308
03:03:29,840 --> 03:03:30,720
They lied.

5309
03:03:31,800 --> 03:03:33,320
Epex Legend's lying to us?

5310
03:03:33,420 --> 03:03:33,900
There's no way.

5311
03:03:34,000 --> 03:03:35,320
I'm always an apex believer.

5312
03:03:35,720 --> 03:03:35,940
Jeez.

5313
03:03:37,200 --> 03:03:37,640
Yes.

5314
03:03:39,400 --> 03:03:41,300
How bad do you want that sponsorship?

5315
03:03:46,800 --> 03:03:50,800
I already got sponsored, what do you mean?

5316
03:03:51,860 --> 03:03:53,540
So you can drop the act then.

5317
03:03:55,020 --> 03:03:55,860
What do you mean?

5318
03:03:56,200 --> 03:03:58,500
I want to keep getting sponsored.

5319
03:04:01,720 --> 03:04:05,100
I don't know about you guys, but I get paid to play this game.

5320
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:13,840
I mean, unless she was getting paid for like five years to play the game.

5321
03:04:14,820 --> 03:04:15,920
Just not from them.

5322
03:04:16,520 --> 03:04:18,840
Well, from them too, because they kept winning their journeys.

5323
03:04:21,580 --> 03:04:22,640
Oh, look at that.

5324
03:04:22,800 --> 03:04:24,380
I always believed in Restia.

5325
03:04:25,660 --> 03:04:27,360
I'm a team player, by the way.

5326
03:04:27,840 --> 03:04:29,260
Yeah, I knew it.

5327
03:04:29,880 --> 03:04:33,880
That technically makes you the pro player since you're making money off this game.

5328
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:35,060
So you should be carrying us though.

5329
03:04:35,100 --> 03:04:38,880
No, because you've made the most out of tournaments though.

5330
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:40,020
Yeah, but I'm not a pro player anymore.

5331
03:04:40,480 --> 03:04:42,280
You are currently a pro player.

5332
03:04:42,360 --> 03:04:43,440
No, no, no, no.

5333
03:04:44,340 --> 03:04:46,420
No, no, no, that doesn't count.

5334
03:04:47,560 --> 03:04:49,620
No, no, no, that's exactly how it works.

5335
03:04:49,720 --> 03:04:49,740
It doesn't count.

5336
03:04:50,060 --> 03:04:53,600
No, no, no, I'm getting paid as a content creator.

5337
03:04:54,820 --> 03:04:55,840
No, no, no, no.

5338
03:04:56,080 --> 03:04:59,100
If you're making money off the game, you're a pro player.

5339
03:04:59,220 --> 03:05:03,140
There's a team that's on Restia right now.

5340
03:05:03,140 --> 03:05:03,560
Oh, my God.

5341
03:05:03,660 --> 03:05:04,940
What the fuck is going on?

5342
03:05:06,340 --> 03:05:07,440
Did we take the zip?

5343
03:05:07,500 --> 03:05:08,240
I think we took the zip.

5344
03:05:08,280 --> 03:05:09,180
I missed the zip.

5345
03:05:09,220 --> 03:05:10,080
I missed the zip.

5346
03:05:21,890 --> 03:05:22,950
I got him.

5347
03:05:27,280 --> 03:05:29,540
I believe in the professional ex-player.

5348
03:05:32,140 --> 03:05:33,280
I'm not a pro player.

5349
03:05:34,180 --> 03:05:35,220
Then what are you?

5350
03:05:35,600 --> 03:05:36,580
There's another team.

5351
03:05:36,660 --> 03:05:37,580
There's another team.

5352
03:05:37,740 --> 03:05:39,420
Just pretend you're already dead.

5353
03:05:41,480 --> 03:05:42,600
Oh, he saw you.

5354
03:05:44,040 --> 03:05:45,260
You're sort of fucked.

5355
03:05:45,680 --> 03:05:46,740
I'm going to watch this.

5356
03:05:47,860 --> 03:05:48,920
Oh, oh, oh.

5357
03:05:50,560 --> 03:05:51,880
Oh, they're coming into the hall.

5358
03:05:51,960 --> 03:05:52,720
They're coming into the hall.

5359
03:05:55,000 --> 03:05:56,540
Oh, they're definitely in there.

5360
03:05:58,100 --> 03:05:59,620
Oh, yeah.

5361
03:06:02,360 --> 03:06:03,160
You're still alive?

5362
03:06:05,300 --> 03:06:06,300
Oh, shit.

5363
03:06:06,620 --> 03:06:07,820
Oh, you're so dead.

5364
03:06:07,860 --> 03:06:08,840
You're going to duck on your ass.

5365
03:06:10,380 --> 03:06:11,900
Wait, how did you live that?

5366
03:06:14,360 --> 03:06:16,260
Don't ask questions you don't want to answer.

5367
03:06:16,340 --> 03:06:17,200
I heard the jump pad.

5368
03:06:19,920 --> 03:06:21,000
I heard a jump pad.

5369
03:06:23,220 --> 03:06:24,480
I got Restia's banner.

5370
03:06:29,470 --> 03:06:30,830
I knew you'd survive.

5371
03:06:35,700 --> 03:06:36,480
A little grief.

5372
03:06:36,620 --> 03:06:37,000
A little grief.

5373
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:37,460
A little bit.

5374
03:06:37,520 --> 03:06:38,080
Just a little bit.

5375
03:06:44,540 --> 03:06:47,160
I have, like, literally, like, no attachments.

5376
03:06:47,160 --> 03:06:48,200
I need my gun.

5377
03:06:48,580 --> 03:06:50,600
I mean, yeah, we just got spotted.

5378
03:06:51,020 --> 03:06:52,180
I have four cells.

5379
03:06:52,460 --> 03:06:53,100
I have nothing.

5380
03:06:53,840 --> 03:06:55,000
We can craft here.

5381
03:06:55,280 --> 03:06:55,880
You got this.

5382
03:06:56,080 --> 03:06:56,600
You got this.

5383
03:06:57,260 --> 03:06:58,820
I have a mobile respawn, though.

5384
03:06:59,420 --> 03:07:00,600
Yeah, you just need to craft me.

5385
03:07:03,140 --> 03:07:07,620
Or you could, like, res Restia now and then craft me and then res me on the other res.

5386
03:07:07,620 --> 03:07:12,880
I feel like if I res first, I'm going to get fucking aggroed on and then we're going to die by the time I craft you.

5387
03:07:12,880 --> 03:07:14,900
Yeah, but then Restia would survive.

5388
03:07:17,000 --> 03:07:20,480
Yeah, but if I res both of you guys, you have higher chances 3v3.

5389
03:07:23,680 --> 03:07:25,740
Well, we lost the last 3v3.

5390
03:07:28,020 --> 03:07:29,660
Wait, no, we won it because I carry.

5391
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:31,540
You don't have to fucking point that out, dude.

5392
03:07:37,100 --> 03:07:38,880
Yeah, we can let Restia pull aggro.

5393
03:07:39,120 --> 03:07:40,480
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

5394
03:07:44,680 --> 03:07:46,160
That's three fucking teams.

5395
03:07:48,640 --> 03:07:51,220
Oh, you are using Restia.

5396
03:07:53,160 --> 03:07:53,960
What happened?

5397
03:07:54,400 --> 03:07:58,540
I thought you weren't going to use Restia's aggro.

5398
03:07:59,120 --> 03:07:59,900
What happened?

5399
03:08:03,260 --> 03:08:05,460
What happened is that we were not going to live through it.

5400
03:08:06,960 --> 03:08:07,760
Goodbye, Restia.

5401
03:08:08,620 --> 03:08:09,020
Goodbye.

5402
03:08:09,180 --> 03:08:10,320
Oh, look at him.

5403
03:08:10,320 --> 03:08:12,420
He has a shield already and everything.

5404
03:08:12,840 --> 03:08:13,860
Come here and res me.

5405
03:08:13,960 --> 03:08:14,600
Come here and res me.

5406
03:08:14,740 --> 03:08:15,360
He's not.

5407
03:08:15,360 --> 03:08:16,520
He's chasing alone, alone.

5408
03:08:16,620 --> 03:08:17,360
He's alone behind you.

5409
03:08:18,240 --> 03:08:19,720
I don't think he is.

5410
03:08:19,840 --> 03:08:20,280
I don't know.

5411
03:08:21,340 --> 03:08:22,100
He is alone.

5412
03:08:22,200 --> 03:08:23,880
Oh, it's in time zone.

5413
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:24,400
It's in time zone.

5414
03:08:26,280 --> 03:08:26,640
Dumbass.

5415
03:08:27,060 --> 03:08:28,180
Let's take Rift's game.

5416
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:28,960
Oh, wait, no.

5417
03:08:29,040 --> 03:08:30,260
Oh, he's one HP.

5418
03:08:30,340 --> 03:08:31,100
He's literally one.

5419
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:34,420
That was so close.

5420
03:08:34,500 --> 03:08:34,760
He's dead, though.

5421
03:08:34,760 --> 03:08:35,840
This team is going to kill him now.

5422
03:08:36,900 --> 03:08:37,960
Wait, how is he going to...

5423
03:08:37,960 --> 03:08:38,880
No, he's all right.

5424
03:08:39,560 --> 03:08:41,660
There's a team right next to him that's not shooting at him.

5425
03:08:41,700 --> 03:08:42,000
What?

5426
03:08:42,040 --> 03:08:42,700
Are they teaming?

5427
03:08:43,420 --> 03:08:44,180
What is he doing?

5428
03:08:44,180 --> 03:08:46,000
No, we'll never know.

5429
03:08:46,600 --> 03:08:47,580
We got him.

5430
03:08:48,320 --> 03:08:49,360
We'll never know.

5431
03:08:49,360 --> 03:08:49,380
We'll never know.

5432
03:08:49,380 --> 03:08:49,420
It's OK.

5433
03:08:49,620 --> 03:08:50,300
We'll probably sleep there.

5434
03:08:52,900 --> 03:08:55,600
We'll never know what happened to him.

5435
03:08:55,600 --> 03:08:57,240
Damn, I really thought I griefed them, dude.

5436
03:08:57,540 --> 03:08:58,960
He probably died to his own.

5437
03:08:59,040 --> 03:08:59,780
He was one HP, right?

5438
03:09:00,640 --> 03:09:01,040
Probably.

5439
03:09:03,680 --> 03:09:06,320
Probably, like, you would assume so.

5440
03:09:09,480 --> 03:09:09,880
Okay.

5441
03:09:11,400 --> 03:09:12,300
Now that we're all...

5442
03:09:12,300 --> 03:09:13,260
They were all getting out of there.

5443
03:09:13,340 --> 03:09:13,860
We were surrounded.

5444
03:09:13,960 --> 03:09:14,160
We were surrounded.

5445
03:09:14,180 --> 03:09:16,720
Look, I think it's because not all of us were serious.

5446
03:09:16,900 --> 03:09:20,280
If all of us start playing seriously, then like we'll win this next game.

5447
03:09:21,420 --> 03:09:22,320
Rezzy was serious.

5448
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:23,000
I was serious.

5449
03:09:23,080 --> 03:09:23,720
I was serious too.

5450
03:09:23,980 --> 03:09:25,160
I was very serious.

5451
03:09:25,480 --> 03:09:26,900
So all of us were serious then?

5452
03:09:27,020 --> 03:09:27,740
No, no, no.

5453
03:09:28,060 --> 03:09:29,880
Someone's lying and it's not me.

5454
03:09:32,180 --> 03:09:33,900
No, it's definitely not you.

5455
03:09:35,500 --> 03:09:39,220
I literally helped you knock two when we got Rezzed.

5456
03:09:39,240 --> 03:09:40,040
What do you mean?

5457
03:09:40,560 --> 03:09:42,340
I mean, yeah, why would you lie?

5458
03:09:42,440 --> 03:09:42,940
Like that's insane.

5459
03:09:42,940 --> 03:09:44,340
Yeah, why would I lie?

5460
03:09:44,580 --> 03:09:46,280
I'm always serious when I have to be.

5461
03:09:49,540 --> 03:09:52,140
Since you're so serious, you can just jump master us.

5462
03:09:52,280 --> 03:09:52,720
Yeah, sure.

5463
03:09:53,040 --> 03:09:53,400
Seriously.

5464
03:09:55,080 --> 03:09:55,900
There we go.

5465
03:09:56,140 --> 03:09:57,380
That's a very serious drop here.

5466
03:09:57,620 --> 03:10:00,580
Yeah, it is because I believe in my team to not die.

5467
03:10:06,080 --> 03:10:07,980
That's a serious laugh, by the way.

5468
03:10:08,340 --> 03:10:09,540
That's a serious statement.

5469
03:10:09,820 --> 03:10:12,940
There is a team in this building.

5470
03:10:13,500 --> 03:10:14,680
But because I believe...

5471
03:10:14,680 --> 03:10:15,740
I believe in my teammates.

5472
03:10:17,360 --> 03:10:18,340
There's an Ashe.

5473
03:10:18,680 --> 03:10:19,420
There's an Ashe with me.

5474
03:10:21,960 --> 03:10:22,320
Flesh?

5475
03:10:22,460 --> 03:10:24,060
How did I just end up with a wingman?

5476
03:10:24,060 --> 03:10:24,200
What the fuck?

5477
03:10:24,260 --> 03:10:24,800
He's like one.

5478
03:10:25,780 --> 03:10:26,600
He's literally one.

5479
03:10:27,900 --> 03:10:29,460
Is there a sniper on me anywhere?

5480
03:10:30,140 --> 03:10:30,500
Nope.

5481
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:33,140
I don't have a wingman.

5482
03:10:33,220 --> 03:10:34,140
There's a charge rifle here.

5483
03:10:36,700 --> 03:10:38,220
Well, is there a sniper on me?

5484
03:10:38,820 --> 03:10:39,660
Uh, yeah.

5485
03:10:41,180 --> 03:10:42,520
I'm gonna go for this Ashe.

5486
03:10:44,680 --> 03:10:44,800
Oh, he left.

5487
03:10:49,100 --> 03:10:49,640
Back down?

5488
03:10:50,500 --> 03:10:50,900
Where?

5489
03:10:51,080 --> 03:10:51,740
In the house?

5490
03:10:52,820 --> 03:10:53,820
I'm heading over to you.

5491
03:10:53,940 --> 03:10:54,340
On the roof.

5492
03:10:56,920 --> 03:10:57,960
Is he still on the roof?

5493
03:10:57,960 --> 03:10:58,700
He's inside the house now?

5494
03:10:59,340 --> 03:10:59,980
Holy life.

5495
03:11:00,080 --> 03:11:00,780
I'm in the house?

5496
03:11:04,740 --> 03:11:06,400
Wait, this guy has a tap strafer again.

5497
03:11:06,620 --> 03:11:07,220
On my door.

5498
03:11:07,560 --> 03:11:07,960
Flesh?

5499
03:11:08,580 --> 03:11:09,880
I'm getting shot in my back as well.

5500
03:11:09,980 --> 03:11:10,040
Oh my god.

5501
03:11:10,100 --> 03:11:10,940
Yeah, I'm healing.

5502
03:11:14,340 --> 03:11:14,700
I'm healing.

5503
03:11:15,160 --> 03:11:15,740
I'm healing.

5504
03:11:16,620 --> 03:11:17,140
I'm healing.

5505
03:11:17,140 --> 03:11:17,500
I only have syringe.

5506
03:11:17,740 --> 03:11:18,160
Oh my god.

5507
03:11:18,160 --> 03:11:19,300
Oh my god.

5508
03:11:19,420 --> 03:11:19,680
Okay.

5509
03:11:21,320 --> 03:11:21,960
That's awkward.

5510
03:11:22,080 --> 03:11:22,920
Crack the fuck out of him.

5511
03:11:22,980 --> 03:11:23,480
Swing that guy.

5512
03:11:23,580 --> 03:11:24,540
I have to reload.

5513
03:11:24,760 --> 03:11:25,580
I don't have ammo.

5514
03:11:27,040 --> 03:11:28,520
If there's him, I really need this.

5515
03:11:28,520 --> 03:11:28,840
Break that.

5516
03:11:28,980 --> 03:11:29,260
Break that.

5517
03:11:29,260 --> 03:11:29,500
Break that.

5518
03:11:29,500 --> 03:11:29,560
Break that.

5519
03:11:29,580 --> 03:11:30,760
Oh my god.

5520
03:11:30,800 --> 03:11:31,740
No audio again.

5521
03:11:31,740 --> 03:11:32,240
There's a new team.

5522
03:11:32,320 --> 03:11:32,720
There's a new team.

5523
03:11:32,740 --> 03:11:32,920
I know.

5524
03:11:32,980 --> 03:11:33,500
I need a heal.

5525
03:11:35,580 --> 03:11:36,220
Just run.

5526
03:11:36,560 --> 03:11:37,540
Running is the best option.

5527
03:11:37,800 --> 03:11:37,820
Oh, okay.

5528
03:11:39,480 --> 03:11:40,940
I didn't realize running...

5529
03:11:40,940 --> 03:11:42,800
Oh, are you guys sure running was the best option?

5530
03:11:43,120 --> 03:11:46,580
Yeah, I mean, there's two more teams, so running is the best option.

5531
03:11:46,740 --> 03:11:46,820
Oh, okay.

5532
03:11:46,820 --> 03:11:47,500
Okay, let's do this.

5533
03:11:47,500 --> 03:11:48,560
Oh, Crafthouse Resnus?

5534
03:11:49,040 --> 03:11:49,660
Sure, let's do it.

5535
03:11:49,660 --> 03:11:50,300
I'm not dead yet.

5536
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:51,240
I'm dead now.

5537
03:11:51,420 --> 03:11:54,480
Okay, I only have a shield back, but that's fine.

5538
03:11:54,520 --> 03:11:55,740
They're fucking killing each other now.

5539
03:11:56,280 --> 03:11:56,640
Okay.

5540
03:11:56,920 --> 03:11:57,220
Yeah.

5541
03:11:59,700 --> 03:12:00,520
They won't know.

5542
03:12:01,760 --> 03:12:03,300
Yeah, you can res us right there and we'll win.

5543
03:12:03,740 --> 03:12:05,020
That's why I'm trying to...

5544
03:12:05,020 --> 03:12:05,440
And that's from Gouda.

5545
03:12:06,700 --> 03:12:09,080
Bring them home.

5546
03:12:09,240 --> 03:12:10,020
He's right there behind you.

5547
03:12:10,220 --> 03:12:11,420
Yeah, I'm heading over.

5548
03:12:11,500 --> 03:12:12,320
I have to walk around.

5549
03:12:14,980 --> 03:12:15,900
They won't know, right?

5550
03:12:16,880 --> 03:12:17,820
I literally have no skills.

5551
03:12:17,820 --> 03:12:18,320
Yeah, there's some busy.

5552
03:12:18,480 --> 03:12:19,780
They are still 1v1'ing, I think.

5553
03:12:22,740 --> 03:12:24,020
Two knocks from one team.

5554
03:12:26,040 --> 03:12:27,600
And then one knock from another team.

5555
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:29,400
I am just going to see if there are heals here.

5556
03:12:29,540 --> 03:12:30,480
Yeah, there is a bubble as well.

5557
03:12:30,560 --> 03:12:31,320
They are probably bubble resin.

5558
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,120
By the way, I got killed by no audio again.

5559
03:12:36,440 --> 03:12:37,260
I am going to thirst.

5560
03:12:37,660 --> 03:12:39,180
Oh, I see them.

5561
03:12:39,320 --> 03:12:39,660
They are on the roof.

5562
03:12:41,880 --> 03:12:43,300
I am looking at them, but...

5563
03:12:44,300 --> 03:12:46,400
I am just going to try and thirst this guy for you guys.

5564
03:12:47,020 --> 03:12:47,900
One is on the roof.

5565
03:12:48,220 --> 03:12:50,600
And the other enemy team is also there.

5566
03:12:51,520 --> 03:12:52,720
There are a couple on the roof.

5567
03:12:54,540 --> 03:12:55,380
What the fuck?

5568
03:12:56,680 --> 03:12:57,500
Where did he go?

5569
03:12:59,240 --> 03:13:00,040
I mean...

5570
03:13:00,040 --> 03:13:00,660
Oh.

5571
03:13:02,320 --> 03:13:02,900
Splash, splash.

5572
03:13:03,020 --> 03:13:03,420
Oh, there is two.

5573
03:13:05,020 --> 03:13:05,640
Gibraltar, splash.

5574
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:07,900
How many people are here?

5575
03:13:08,040 --> 03:13:08,760
What the fuck?

5576
03:13:09,220 --> 03:13:09,780
A lot.

5577
03:13:10,280 --> 03:13:11,440
Guys, there is a lot of people.

5578
03:13:13,380 --> 03:13:16,240
There is another team on the second floor.

5579
03:13:17,340 --> 03:13:17,760
Alright.

5580
03:13:18,420 --> 03:13:19,740
There is a new team, I think.

5581
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,040
A lifeline which is double Mozambique.

5582
03:13:24,180 --> 03:13:24,860
That is a new team.

5583
03:13:24,920 --> 03:13:25,160
I see it.

5584
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:27,240
That is a new team.

5585
03:13:27,240 --> 03:13:30,640
Dude, that is crazy that he could use a fucking gold player.

5586
03:13:30,760 --> 03:13:32,280
That just puts me down like that.

5587
03:13:32,320 --> 03:13:33,460
Because he is double Mozambique.

5588
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:36,600
Holy shit, how many teams showed up.

5589
03:13:36,660 --> 03:13:37,360
That is crazy.

5590
03:13:38,520 --> 03:13:39,420
Yeah, I ruined your mom.

5591
03:13:40,480 --> 03:13:43,720
The rest brought in the entire two new teams.

5592
03:13:43,820 --> 03:13:44,660
This is who killed me, bro.

5593
03:13:46,400 --> 03:13:47,260
That is not on us chat.

5594
03:13:47,400 --> 03:13:50,020
That was literally like 8th party central.

5595
03:13:50,780 --> 03:13:51,660
Right there.

5596
03:13:54,260 --> 03:13:56,540
Someone in my chat is asking me, what is a good dog name?

5597
03:13:57,280 --> 03:13:58,520
What is a good dog name?

5598
03:13:58,780 --> 03:14:00,600
Name your dog after RPR.

5599
03:14:01,040 --> 03:14:01,980
So you can...

5600
03:14:02,500 --> 03:14:03,900
Why would you name your dog after RPR?

5601
03:14:03,900 --> 03:14:04,540
That is hard to say.

5602
03:14:04,980 --> 03:14:05,840
Why not RPR?

5603
03:14:05,880 --> 03:14:06,520
Hey, RPR.

5604
03:14:06,600 --> 03:14:07,280
Come on, RPR.

5605
03:14:07,660 --> 03:14:10,320
I think Axel is a great name, personally.

5606
03:14:12,660 --> 03:14:14,120
Oh yeah, name it after me.

5607
03:14:15,780 --> 03:14:16,980
Don't name it after her.

5608
03:14:16,980 --> 03:14:17,920
Name it after me.

5609
03:14:19,900 --> 03:14:20,520
Why not?

5610
03:14:20,920 --> 03:14:21,040
Okay.

5611
03:14:21,520 --> 03:14:23,720
Name the fucking dog, Doki.

5612
03:14:24,240 --> 03:14:26,380
Yeah, my dog's name is Doki.

5613
03:14:27,160 --> 03:14:27,600
Really?

5614
03:14:27,720 --> 03:14:29,420
Yeah, I need my dog after myself.

5615
03:14:30,300 --> 03:14:31,440
That is the first...

5616
03:14:31,940 --> 03:14:32,160
Why?

5617
03:14:32,440 --> 03:14:33,100
Why not?

5618
03:14:34,320 --> 03:14:38,000
It is going to be like a situation like, what are you peeing here, Doki?

5619
03:14:38,120 --> 03:14:38,800
Something like that.

5620
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:43,840
No, I call him I call him Dad for Doki Amber Doge.

5621
03:14:46,640 --> 03:14:49,740
Or I call him Doki Doggo.

5622
03:14:50,460 --> 03:14:53,600
Is the person you love the most in your life yourself or what?

5623
03:14:53,860 --> 03:14:55,560
No, it's my dog and me.

5624
03:14:55,840 --> 03:14:56,640
Yeah, love yourself.

5625
03:14:59,100 --> 03:15:00,380
You gotta love yourself.

5626
03:15:01,940 --> 03:15:05,740
My mom said, Jesus Christ, the dog has a first and last name.

5627
03:15:05,900 --> 03:15:07,080
And a middle name.

5628
03:15:07,200 --> 03:15:09,500
Yeah, he's gonna be in my will.

5629
03:15:13,300 --> 03:15:14,000
That's not...

5630
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:15,440
Can you put dogs in your will?

5631
03:15:15,540 --> 03:15:16,240
Yeah, I think you can.

5632
03:15:16,340 --> 03:15:18,260
You can actually.

5633
03:15:20,300 --> 03:15:21,320
You can like...

5634
03:15:21,320 --> 03:15:23,020
What can you give them?

5635
03:15:23,520 --> 03:15:24,540
I don't know, money?

5636
03:15:24,860 --> 03:15:25,760
You don't know what a will is?

5637
03:15:26,260 --> 03:15:30,860
Like when you die, you will your stuff.

5638
03:15:30,960 --> 03:15:32,280
You give your stuff to other people.

5639
03:15:32,580 --> 03:15:34,140
So they'll know who gets what.

5640
03:15:34,320 --> 03:15:35,240
It's like your last will.

5641
03:15:37,360 --> 03:15:38,120
Yeah, yeah.

5642
03:15:38,120 --> 03:15:38,440
Yeah.

5643
03:15:41,600 --> 03:15:42,740
I don't know.

5644
03:15:42,820 --> 03:15:45,600
My dog can like get my money.

5645
03:15:47,720 --> 03:15:49,300
He can own my...

5646
03:15:49,300 --> 03:15:50,760
I don't fucking know.

5647
03:15:50,840 --> 03:15:51,580
Do dog things.

5648
03:15:51,720 --> 03:15:52,800
It's his money now.

5649
03:15:54,140 --> 03:15:56,100
I don't think you can give dogs money.

5650
03:15:56,220 --> 03:15:56,720
Yes, you can.

5651
03:15:58,900 --> 03:16:00,580
You can technically.

5652
03:16:00,960 --> 03:16:03,520
And then what happens when a dog passes away?

5653
03:16:03,600 --> 03:16:04,240
Who gets the money?

5654
03:16:04,240 --> 03:16:05,940
I guess like no one.

5655
03:16:05,940 --> 03:16:06,420
The bank.

5656
03:16:08,120 --> 03:16:10,120
So you leave it to the bank?

5657
03:16:13,280 --> 03:16:14,820
I would never leave it to the bank.

5658
03:16:15,200 --> 03:16:16,320
Oh, you don't trust your bank?

5659
03:16:18,440 --> 03:16:20,320
I just don't trust banks in general.

5660
03:16:20,480 --> 03:16:20,760
What do you mean?

5661
03:16:21,040 --> 03:16:24,600
Wait, so you keep all your money underneath your bed in gold or some shit?

5662
03:16:24,840 --> 03:16:26,160
No, I keep it in the bank.

5663
03:16:26,380 --> 03:16:30,020
Yeah, if you keep it in the bank, why are you keeping it in the bank if you don't trust the bank?

5664
03:16:31,380 --> 03:16:32,560
You gotta keep it somewhere.

5665
03:16:32,760 --> 03:16:34,220
You don't want to keep that much cash in there.

5666
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:37,760
Just convert it into gold bars and keep it under your bed.

5667
03:16:37,780 --> 03:16:38,660
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking about.

5668
03:16:39,620 --> 03:16:41,360
Converting to gold bars is crazy.

5669
03:16:41,720 --> 03:16:42,220
What do you mean?

5670
03:16:42,240 --> 03:16:43,680
It's actually good.

5671
03:16:44,220 --> 03:16:46,100
Wait, do you actually do that, Rustia?

5672
03:16:46,600 --> 03:16:47,380
No, I don't know.

5673
03:16:48,860 --> 03:16:50,380
But you said it was good.

5674
03:16:50,920 --> 03:16:52,900
Why are you guys giving me advice you wouldn't do yourself?

5675
03:16:53,160 --> 03:17:01,560
I mean, to be honest, it is smart to keep your money in gold because gold basically never loses value and money loses value over time.

5676
03:17:02,500 --> 03:17:08,560
Now people do it for American dollars because we all know the American dollar will never lose in value.

5677
03:17:10,140 --> 03:17:11,300
Oh yeah, surely.

5678
03:17:11,740 --> 03:17:13,340
Yeah, surely the bubble won't burst.

5679
03:17:14,560 --> 03:17:18,100
Well, I keep my money in euros because euros worth more than the dollar.

5680
03:17:19,080 --> 03:17:20,020
Yeah, that's true.

5681
03:17:20,260 --> 03:17:21,400
Keep your money in euros.

5682
03:17:24,500 --> 03:17:25,600
What if the...

5683
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:32,440
What if the European Union disbands and what will you do?

5684
03:17:33,320 --> 03:17:38,000
I feel like if the European Union disbands, we're kind of fucking...

5685
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:39,800
We're just gonna fuck, you know?

5686
03:17:40,940 --> 03:17:42,820
It's probably like World War 3 type shit.

5687
03:17:43,040 --> 03:17:45,020
Yeah, but then your euros are gonna be worthless.

5688
03:17:45,320 --> 03:17:46,920
That's why you gotta keep in gold bars.

5689
03:17:47,520 --> 03:17:51,960
Yeah, but you know, if something like that happens, everything kind of becomes useless, Doki.

5690
03:17:52,740 --> 03:17:53,660
You don't know that.

5691
03:17:53,920 --> 03:17:55,700
Close to apocalyptic situation.

5692
03:17:56,440 --> 03:17:59,120
You can use the gold bars as a weapon.

5693
03:18:01,720 --> 03:18:02,240
Or...

5694
03:18:03,320 --> 03:18:03,840
How?

5695
03:18:04,680 --> 03:18:06,220
Use it to whack people.

5696
03:18:06,660 --> 03:18:08,360
Yeah, you put it in the...

5697
03:18:08,360 --> 03:18:10,500
Gold is a soft metal.

5698
03:18:10,640 --> 03:18:12,620
You can't even turn it into a sword, dude.

5699
03:18:12,940 --> 03:18:14,280
No, it's really hard.

5700
03:18:14,280 --> 03:18:15,180
It's really hard.

5701
03:18:15,220 --> 03:18:16,240
What do you mean?

5702
03:18:17,180 --> 03:18:17,780
It's a gold bar.

5703
03:18:18,240 --> 03:18:19,320
It's a fucking bar.

5704
03:18:19,320 --> 03:18:19,520
It's heavy as fuck.

5705
03:18:19,520 --> 03:18:20,780
Gold is one of the softest metals.

5706
03:18:21,080 --> 03:18:22,260
Who am I talking to?

5707
03:18:22,520 --> 03:18:27,260
Yeah, but if you use it to fucking hit somebody, then it's gonna hurt.

5708
03:18:27,520 --> 03:18:28,260
You put it in a...

5709
03:18:28,260 --> 03:18:29,960
Yeah, you throw it...

5710
03:18:30,980 --> 03:18:33,600
Once you throw in your one gold bar, No, you don't throw it.

5711
03:18:33,620 --> 03:18:35,100
You put it in a pillowcase.

5712
03:18:35,180 --> 03:18:37,960
You put it in a pillowcase, and then you whack people with it.

5713
03:18:38,260 --> 03:18:39,700
You put it in a pillowcase, and then you whack people with it.

5714
03:18:39,880 --> 03:18:43,660
You wouldn't stay that long in the fucking post-zombie apocalypse.

5715
03:18:44,580 --> 03:18:48,200
I can't believe we're talking about how to whack people with gold bars.

5716
03:18:48,800 --> 03:18:49,380
I can't believe we're talking about how to whack people with gold bars.

5717
03:18:49,580 --> 03:18:52,840
I'm just saying, a gold bar is a better weapon than Euros.

5718
03:18:58,460 --> 03:18:58,900
No.

5719
03:19:00,840 --> 03:19:02,020
What do you mean no?

5720
03:19:02,480 --> 03:19:13,520
What you could do instead, take your Euros and equip yourself for a post-apocalyptic situation with a bunch of weapons and shit, so when it does hit, when Euros and gold are useless, you have guns.

5721
03:19:14,080 --> 03:19:15,740
Yeah, but you don't know when it's gonna hit.

5722
03:19:15,860 --> 03:19:16,800
It comes out of nowhere.

5723
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:18,080
You can't just predict that.

5724
03:19:18,100 --> 03:19:19,660
It doesn't matter if you don't know.

5725
03:19:19,960 --> 03:19:20,920
That's how you stay prepared.

5726
03:19:21,860 --> 03:19:22,920
Are you prepared?

5727
03:19:23,140 --> 03:19:24,640
Are you prepared for the doomsday situation?

5728
03:19:24,740 --> 03:19:25,460
I'm always prepared.

5729
03:19:26,600 --> 03:19:27,360
No, you're not.

5730
03:19:27,380 --> 03:19:29,780
You don't know if I'm being prepared.

5731
03:19:29,880 --> 03:19:31,540
You still have your Euros.

5732
03:19:33,500 --> 03:19:35,280
Who says I'm not using my Euros?

5733
03:19:35,360 --> 03:19:36,240
Just because I have them.

5734
03:19:38,100 --> 03:19:39,540
There's just one car there.

5735
03:19:41,180 --> 03:19:41,860
Where are they?

5736
03:19:42,140 --> 03:19:44,400
Why is there a car there in the middle of the road?

5737
03:19:44,560 --> 03:19:46,160
He came up to me and shot me.

5738
03:19:46,280 --> 03:19:47,780
Then I shot him and he ran away.

5739
03:19:48,360 --> 03:19:49,480
He's literally right there.

5740
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:51,400
Liar.

5741
03:19:52,880 --> 03:19:54,240
He told me he ran away.

5742
03:19:54,420 --> 03:19:55,320
If he's there, then kill him.

5743
03:19:55,420 --> 03:19:55,860
Shoot him.

5744
03:19:56,140 --> 03:19:57,220
I have the heal.

5745
03:19:59,500 --> 03:20:00,340
Why are you losing?

5746
03:20:00,340 --> 03:20:00,980
He shot me first.

5747
03:20:01,200 --> 03:20:02,300
He shot me first.

5748
03:20:04,860 --> 03:20:05,620
Excuse me.

5749
03:20:05,700 --> 03:20:06,920
Where did he go?

5750
03:20:08,060 --> 03:20:09,040
I'm not sure.

5751
03:20:10,740 --> 03:20:12,140
He was heading back.

5752
03:20:13,080 --> 03:20:13,480
I'm going to lose.

5753
03:20:14,480 --> 03:20:20,280
Ducky, do you think if there was a zombie apocalypse or any apocalypse of any kind that you would be able to survive?

5754
03:20:20,300 --> 03:20:21,040
Oh no, I'd die.

5755
03:20:21,060 --> 03:20:23,140
I 100% would die.

5756
03:20:23,460 --> 03:20:24,520
We're literally streamers.

5757
03:20:24,560 --> 03:20:26,380
What kind of survival skills do I have?

5758
03:20:26,900 --> 03:20:27,620
I'd live.

5759
03:20:30,820 --> 03:20:32,420
I know why you're laughing.

5760
03:20:32,620 --> 03:20:34,500
You don't know nothing about me.

5761
03:20:37,440 --> 03:20:39,840
I mean, I believe you.

5762
03:20:40,400 --> 03:20:42,900
Why did you laugh, Rusty, when you said that?

5763
03:20:43,640 --> 03:20:45,100
I don't know why you're laughing.

5764
03:20:47,460 --> 03:20:52,940
He looks like he looks like he's going to be in the apocalypse.

5765
03:20:54,100 --> 03:20:57,480
He looks like he's already living through it.

5766
03:20:58,320 --> 03:21:00,340
I would easily survive apocalypse.

5767
03:21:00,500 --> 03:21:07,180
I'm the most capable of all the pro players in the fucking Apex.

5768
03:21:07,820 --> 03:21:09,540
I'm the most capable of survival.

5769
03:21:11,280 --> 03:21:13,080
What do you fucking know about me?

5770
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:14,640
What do you know if I go outside right now?

5771
03:21:14,780 --> 03:21:16,240
You don't fucking know this shit.

5772
03:21:16,300 --> 03:21:17,460
You're just talking on your ass.

5773
03:21:17,660 --> 03:21:23,000
I fucking stream how many times a week?

5774
03:21:23,380 --> 03:21:24,260
Five or six.

5775
03:21:24,260 --> 03:21:27,720
That leaves me two days, one to two days to do whatever I want.

5776
03:21:28,820 --> 03:21:29,260
Nice.

5777
03:21:29,520 --> 03:21:30,520
And what do you do?

5778
03:21:32,240 --> 03:21:32,680
Workout.

5779
03:21:33,060 --> 03:21:33,800
There's a guy here.

5780
03:21:34,780 --> 03:21:35,500
Oh, okay.

5781
03:21:38,380 --> 03:21:39,700
That's his teammates, right?

5782
03:21:42,080 --> 03:21:45,080
That poor guy, leaving his teammates out there to die.

5783
03:21:45,780 --> 03:21:47,000
I never do that.

5784
03:21:47,500 --> 03:21:48,740
I just noreg them.

5785
03:21:49,200 --> 03:21:51,420
And he's crafting his teammates in front of me.

5786
03:21:51,740 --> 03:21:52,860
That's what he's looking like.

5787
03:21:54,260 --> 03:21:55,560
He doesn't respect you.

5788
03:21:57,160 --> 03:21:58,040
Wait, you're right.

5789
03:21:58,120 --> 03:21:59,700
If RPR can survive, I can survive.

5790
03:22:00,020 --> 03:22:01,220
I live in Canada!

5791
03:22:01,500 --> 03:22:03,540
Zombies can't get me in Canada.

5792
03:22:04,160 --> 03:22:05,160
It's too cold.

5793
03:22:06,020 --> 03:22:07,140
It's too cold.

5794
03:22:07,540 --> 03:22:08,960
That doesn't stop them.

5795
03:22:09,080 --> 03:22:10,420
In movies it does.

5796
03:22:12,020 --> 03:22:14,180
If it's too cold, the zombies...

5797
03:22:14,180 --> 03:22:17,060
Canada is usually like the safe haven from a zombie apocalypse.

5798
03:22:19,940 --> 03:22:21,100
No fucking way.

5799
03:22:21,100 --> 03:22:22,500
I've never heard that in my life.

5800
03:22:22,520 --> 03:22:23,780
It's in every movie.

5801
03:22:24,560 --> 03:22:25,940
There's some bullshit.

5802
03:22:26,120 --> 03:22:27,020
People will just freeze.

5803
03:22:27,240 --> 03:22:31,080
People will be like, let's move to Canada because there's lack of zombies here.

5804
03:22:31,160 --> 03:22:32,320
Explain Project Zomboid then.

5805
03:22:32,560 --> 03:22:34,280
Project Zomboid isn't in Canada.

5806
03:22:36,160 --> 03:22:37,840
Project Zomboid has winter.

5807
03:22:38,040 --> 03:22:39,280
Like really bad winter.

5808
03:22:39,280 --> 03:22:41,040
Yeah, but it's not Canadian winter.

5809
03:22:42,880 --> 03:22:44,640
You're making no fucking sense.

5810
03:22:45,820 --> 03:22:48,780
No, you don't know what Canadian winter is like.

5811
03:22:52,760 --> 03:22:54,340
Extra supplies, let's go.

5812
03:22:57,760 --> 03:22:58,860
It's true though.

5813
03:22:58,980 --> 03:23:00,960
In every zombie scenario...

5814
03:23:01,620 --> 03:23:03,880
In every zombie scenario, they'll always be like, let's move to...

5815
03:23:03,880 --> 03:23:05,980
I don't know what kind of zombie scenarios you were watching.

5816
03:23:06,320 --> 03:23:07,540
They're like, let's move to Canada.

5817
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:08,860
Because it's like the safe...

5818
03:23:08,860 --> 03:23:11,280
Even in The Walking Dead, they're like, let's go to Canada.

5819
03:23:12,060 --> 03:23:12,940
It's the safest.

5820
03:23:12,940 --> 03:23:14,020
Oh my god, what the...

5821
03:23:14,020 --> 03:23:17,200
Did the robot legs get you again?

5822
03:23:18,320 --> 03:23:19,320
Did the robot...

5823
03:23:20,400 --> 03:23:22,240
Did the robot legs...

5824
03:23:22,240 --> 03:23:22,280
Did the robot legs...

5825
03:23:22,280 --> 03:23:24,840
I think the robot legs got to him.

5826
03:23:24,840 --> 03:23:26,180
I'll be able to escape.

5827
03:23:26,460 --> 03:23:28,080
I'm gonna go craft him.

5828
03:23:29,780 --> 03:23:31,300
Jesus fucking Christ.

5829
03:23:33,060 --> 03:23:35,340
Why is he always so far away from us?

5830
03:23:36,080 --> 03:23:38,940
He can't help it, the robot legs!

5831
03:23:39,060 --> 03:23:40,600
I was killing...

5832
03:23:40,600 --> 03:23:42,740
the guy that was in zone.

5833
03:23:42,780 --> 03:23:44,100
I was running, dude.

5834
03:23:44,540 --> 03:23:45,300
What do you mean?

5835
03:23:45,580 --> 03:23:47,360
You're not paying attention, you're dying.

5836
03:23:47,880 --> 03:23:50,300
No, I'm paying attention.

5837
03:23:53,400 --> 03:23:54,560
You don't understand.

5838
03:23:54,840 --> 03:23:57,140
Dad, it's the robot legs!

5839
03:23:58,600 --> 03:23:59,780
The audio!

5840
03:24:00,520 --> 03:24:02,900
Was it actually the robot legs, Justia?

5841
03:24:03,220 --> 03:24:04,140
It is.

5842
03:24:04,180 --> 03:24:14,660
To be completely honest, there were two guys on my ass and there was zero audio.

5843
03:24:14,780 --> 03:24:15,700
I had no clue.

5844
03:24:16,660 --> 03:24:17,940
It's okay, I got you.

5845
03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:19,360
Was that backfiring?

5846
03:24:19,360 --> 03:24:20,980
You keep dying to audio, dude.

5847
03:24:22,400 --> 03:24:23,080
Alright.

5848
03:24:24,840 --> 03:24:25,720
I'm going into gear 3, dude.

5849
03:24:27,720 --> 03:24:28,420
Going to what?

5850
03:24:30,480 --> 03:24:31,640
You know what, Justia?

5851
03:24:36,390 --> 03:24:37,510
Justia, what do you need to do?

5852
03:24:37,510 --> 03:24:38,210
I'm not gonna die.

5853
03:24:38,410 --> 03:24:39,510
I'm not gonna die again.

5854
03:24:40,110 --> 03:24:41,470
Okay, I believe in you.

5855
03:24:41,550 --> 03:24:42,670
I thought you were serious, by the way.

5856
03:24:43,390 --> 03:24:44,530
There's a big fight here!

5857
03:24:44,750 --> 03:24:49,090
Justia's not a cat girl, he's an actual cat now.

5858
03:24:50,090 --> 03:24:51,090
He's a literal cat.

5859
03:24:53,690 --> 03:24:55,230
Justia was never a cat girl.

5860
03:24:55,390 --> 03:24:55,890
Yes, he was.

5861
03:24:56,150 --> 03:24:56,650
He's a dude.

5862
03:24:57,490 --> 03:24:58,630
He was a cat girl.

5863
03:24:58,770 --> 03:25:00,290
A dude can be a cat girl.

5864
03:25:00,310 --> 03:25:00,750
I caught two of them in there.

5865
03:25:02,430 --> 03:25:03,290
I got one.

5866
03:25:06,190 --> 03:25:07,430
I'm fucking penis.

5867
03:25:07,730 --> 03:25:08,690
Oh my god, he's flashed!

5868
03:25:08,710 --> 03:25:08,970
He's flashed!

5869
03:25:09,070 --> 03:25:12,410
Last guy outside here.

5870
03:25:13,530 --> 03:25:13,890
Alright.

5871
03:25:14,350 --> 03:25:15,070
Last guy out here.

5872
03:25:16,010 --> 03:25:17,070
He's resing, he's healing.

5873
03:25:17,210 --> 03:25:18,390
I'll res, I'll res, I'll res.

5874
03:25:19,630 --> 03:25:20,750
That's not you, okay.

5875
03:25:23,370 --> 03:25:24,270
I knew it.

5876
03:25:24,270 --> 03:25:25,790
Restio got super serious.

5877
03:25:28,130 --> 03:25:28,530
Yup.

5878
03:25:29,910 --> 03:25:30,830
Oh hey, there's another.

5879
03:25:31,310 --> 03:25:32,070
Oh yeah.

5880
03:25:32,170 --> 03:25:35,950
Oh yeah.

5881
03:25:36,030 --> 03:25:38,090
You wanna give me that fucking gold knockdown or what?

5882
03:25:38,090 --> 03:25:38,850
You didn't have one?

5883
03:25:38,890 --> 03:25:39,690
I thought you had one.

5884
03:25:39,970 --> 03:25:41,450
Why did you ask me and not Restio?

5885
03:25:41,530 --> 03:25:43,770
He had a fucking gold first!

5886
03:25:43,990 --> 03:25:46,310
Did I say a name?

5887
03:25:46,390 --> 03:25:47,190
Did I say a name?

5888
03:25:48,390 --> 03:25:49,610
Did I say a name?

5889
03:25:50,750 --> 03:25:51,730
I don't care.

5890
03:25:51,730 --> 03:25:52,670
What do you want from me?

5891
03:25:52,690 --> 03:25:54,730
You are yelling at Restio too!

5892
03:25:56,390 --> 03:26:00,470
I said can you give me a gold knockdown.

5893
03:26:00,550 --> 03:26:02,150
I didn't say Restia or Doki.

5894
03:26:02,250 --> 03:26:04,690
One of you give me a fucking knockdown.

5895
03:26:06,150 --> 03:26:07,390
Restia had it first.

5896
03:26:08,130 --> 03:26:11,450
Why are you picking one up to begin with, Doki?

5897
03:26:14,610 --> 03:26:16,710
I dropped the purple by the way.

5898
03:26:18,710 --> 03:26:19,750
He's a purple.

5899
03:26:20,250 --> 03:26:21,090
Level three.

5900
03:26:21,170 --> 03:26:21,670
I'm a purple.

5901
03:26:21,730 --> 03:26:22,130
Gold one.

5902
03:26:22,170 --> 03:26:25,310
No, I'm talking about Restia because I think about other people too.

5903
03:26:27,170 --> 03:26:28,630
She didn't say a name.

5904
03:26:29,490 --> 03:26:30,610
Yeah, I didn't say a name.

5905
03:26:30,670 --> 03:26:31,110
Exactly.

5906
03:26:31,230 --> 03:26:32,510
I didn't say a name.

5907
03:26:34,750 --> 03:26:35,450
Who's won?

5908
03:26:36,670 --> 03:26:42,490
This guy with red armor there literally has one HP on base health and almost nothing.

5909
03:26:43,570 --> 03:26:44,830
Oh, I see him.

5910
03:26:45,590 --> 03:26:46,670
I don't actually.

5911
03:26:46,710 --> 03:26:47,850
I think maybe.

5912
03:26:48,730 --> 03:26:49,490
I don't.

5913
03:26:49,510 --> 03:26:50,350
I didn't see him.

5914
03:26:51,730 --> 03:26:52,350
He's hiding here as well.

5915
03:26:53,410 --> 03:26:54,650
I knocked one.

5916
03:26:55,150 --> 03:26:56,210
What the fuck?

5917
03:26:57,450 --> 03:26:58,530
Go, Doki, go.

5918
03:26:58,690 --> 03:26:59,710
I'm heading over.

5919
03:27:02,090 --> 03:27:03,330
Oh my god.

5920
03:27:03,490 --> 03:27:04,650
He slowed me down.

5921
03:27:05,290 --> 03:27:06,230
One team dead.

5922
03:27:08,410 --> 03:27:09,950
I think there's two knocks.

5923
03:27:10,130 --> 03:27:12,370
I just got beam.

5924
03:27:14,130 --> 03:27:14,770
On me?

5925
03:27:15,170 --> 03:27:15,850
On you?

5926
03:27:15,990 --> 03:27:16,910
On me.

5927
03:27:16,970 --> 03:27:19,270
Wait, there's a different team then.

5928
03:27:19,270 --> 03:27:20,250
It's the teams, yeah.

5929
03:27:21,190 --> 03:27:22,490
Okay, I'm backing out then.

5930
03:27:25,210 --> 03:27:25,950
It's under you.

5931
03:27:26,610 --> 03:27:27,290
Under me?

5932
03:27:29,430 --> 03:27:29,970
Oh, yeah.

5933
03:27:30,070 --> 03:27:30,690
What the fuck?

5934
03:27:31,110 --> 03:27:31,510
Okay.

5935
03:27:32,110 --> 03:27:33,750
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

5936
03:27:33,890 --> 03:27:36,770
Oh my god, you just threw me into the fucking pit.

5937
03:27:37,730 --> 03:27:38,990
I should have streamed.

5938
03:27:41,570 --> 03:27:43,770
Yeah, even when you help her, it's not good enough.

5939
03:27:43,870 --> 03:27:44,730
What do you mean?

5940
03:27:45,490 --> 03:27:47,510
Horizon Q scared the shit out of me.

5941
03:27:47,630 --> 03:27:48,890
I didn't say it didn't help.

5942
03:27:49,270 --> 03:27:53,070
I just said that you almost threw me into the pit, but I didn't get thrown into the pit.

5943
03:27:55,230 --> 03:27:56,450
It's never good enough.

5944
03:27:56,970 --> 03:27:57,950
I didn't say that.

5945
03:27:59,750 --> 03:28:01,530
Now you're putting words in my mouth.

5946
03:28:02,390 --> 03:28:05,550
I'm not gonna say who, but somebody in my chat said you need hearing aid, ducky.

5947
03:28:07,850 --> 03:28:08,610
That's not true.

5948
03:28:10,010 --> 03:28:11,750
Oh, so you're just gonna get one guide?

5949
03:28:13,070 --> 03:28:14,590
No, you're getting one guide.

5950
03:28:14,750 --> 03:28:15,830
No, you're getting one guide.

5951
03:28:18,510 --> 03:28:19,550
There's people in front of me.

5952
03:28:19,590 --> 03:28:21,270
I'm just reading out a comment that I agree with.

5953
03:28:23,750 --> 03:28:24,890
I cracked two.

5954
03:28:26,450 --> 03:28:27,310
What the fuck?

5955
03:28:29,510 --> 03:28:31,230
Oh, there's a team inside here too.

5956
03:28:31,230 --> 03:28:31,870
Oh, there's a team inside here too.

5957
03:28:32,350 --> 03:28:32,910
Oh, there's a team inside here too.

5958
03:28:33,130 --> 03:28:35,330
Oh wait, Rusty is getting a D.Va, so he doesn't care.

5959
03:28:35,710 --> 03:28:35,890
Oh wait, Rusty is getting a D.Va, so he doesn't care.

5960
03:28:36,810 --> 03:28:37,990
I'm not a team player now.

5961
03:28:38,370 --> 03:28:43,310
Alright, I'm gonna grab stuff here.

5962
03:28:43,570 --> 03:28:45,810
Alright, I'm gonna grab stuff here.

5963
03:28:46,390 --> 03:28:49,970
Yeah, but there's four teams alive, so where's the other two?

5964
03:28:51,090 --> 03:28:52,410
I don't know, but let's kill someone.

5965
03:28:53,230 --> 03:28:54,410
Oh, over there?

5966
03:28:55,210 --> 03:28:56,450
I saw a shot there.

5967
03:28:57,330 --> 03:28:58,550
Yeah, I saw bullets, yeah.

5968
03:28:58,910 --> 03:28:59,990
Oh, they're fighting here or something.

5969
03:29:01,270 --> 03:29:02,510
Oh, a Loba ulted.

5970
03:29:02,530 --> 03:29:03,490
Guy in the roof got cracked here.

5971
03:29:03,610 --> 03:29:05,170
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm heading over.

5972
03:29:06,730 --> 03:29:07,630
I'm walking up.

5973
03:29:10,870 --> 03:29:11,610
They're fighting here.

5974
03:29:12,290 --> 03:29:12,830
Where's here?

5975
03:29:14,030 --> 03:29:14,790
On my ping.

5976
03:29:15,950 --> 03:29:17,870
A bunch of dead, a bunch of dead motherfuckers.

5977
03:29:17,950 --> 03:29:19,890
Okay, I'm heading to the roof right now.

5978
03:29:22,450 --> 03:29:23,190
One team dead.

5979
03:29:23,830 --> 03:29:24,650
Where's the other team?

5980
03:29:25,730 --> 03:29:26,610
They're just like deep.

5981
03:29:27,250 --> 03:29:28,210
Deep on this side.

5982
03:29:29,910 --> 03:29:30,870
I'm heading over.

5983
03:29:35,370 --> 03:29:35,730
What?

5984
03:29:35,890 --> 03:29:36,530
Where are they?

5985
03:29:37,590 --> 03:29:38,970
I don't know if they got wiped or not.

5986
03:29:39,490 --> 03:29:40,150
I think they got wiped.

5987
03:29:40,530 --> 03:29:41,390
Woah, Rusty!

5988
03:29:42,770 --> 03:29:43,350
I'm fine.

5989
03:29:43,790 --> 03:29:44,870
Who are you shooting at?

5990
03:29:48,050 --> 03:29:48,710
Bull dead?

5991
03:29:52,140 --> 03:29:53,420
No, there's more, there's more.

5992
03:29:55,360 --> 03:29:56,080
I'm looking.

5993
03:29:57,060 --> 03:29:57,780
Oh, I see him.

5994
03:29:58,300 --> 03:30:00,220
Red armor, too, in front of me.

5995
03:30:01,440 --> 03:30:01,880
Pathfinder.

5996
03:30:02,100 --> 03:30:02,720
Is this one guy or what?

5997
03:30:03,380 --> 03:30:05,540
I don't know, I just saw red armor, pathfinder.

5998
03:30:06,180 --> 03:30:07,300
Dude, let's get the roof here.

5999
03:30:09,300 --> 03:30:09,740
Alright.

6000
03:30:12,100 --> 03:30:12,780
What do I see?

6001
03:30:13,300 --> 03:30:14,820
On my door, right here.

6002
03:30:14,940 --> 03:30:15,640
At the bottom.

6003
03:30:15,640 --> 03:30:15,760
At the bottom.

6004
03:30:18,580 --> 03:30:19,100
What?

6005
03:30:19,700 --> 03:30:20,460
I got one.

6006
03:30:21,520 --> 03:30:22,920
Oh my god, he's actually one.

6007
03:30:23,080 --> 03:30:25,420
I pulled dead.

6008
03:30:25,680 --> 03:30:26,100
Pathfinder's lost.

6009
03:30:28,740 --> 03:30:29,440
He's running over.

6010
03:30:29,580 --> 03:30:31,140
Oh, where's the last team?

6011
03:30:32,400 --> 03:30:33,000
No idea.

6012
03:30:35,420 --> 03:30:36,980
Guys, are we gonna win?

6013
03:30:38,260 --> 03:30:39,180
Oh my god.

6014
03:30:39,520 --> 03:30:41,300
Oh my god, guys!

6015
03:30:41,840 --> 03:30:43,340
We're all so serious!

6016
03:30:44,400 --> 03:30:46,220
I think he's here, behind this wall.

6017
03:30:46,640 --> 03:30:47,280
Let's throw.

6018
03:30:48,060 --> 03:30:49,160
Oh yeah, that's...

6019
03:30:51,080 --> 03:30:51,560
Flash.

6020
03:30:52,960 --> 03:30:53,440
Alright.

6021
03:30:53,560 --> 03:30:53,840
Yay!

6022
03:30:54,600 --> 03:30:57,600
Oh, he does the lob over the red armor to run away from me.

6023
03:30:57,800 --> 03:30:58,660
Oh, that's him.

6024
03:30:59,640 --> 03:31:00,900
We did it, guys!

6025
03:31:01,220 --> 03:31:02,900
We went serious mode!

6026
03:31:03,340 --> 03:31:04,380
It happened!

6027
03:31:05,060 --> 03:31:06,400
We won our pilot game, that's crazy.

6028
03:31:06,480 --> 03:31:10,240
Oh my god, that means like, Breastia deserves his rank.

6029
03:31:11,680 --> 03:31:13,320
Yeah, I said I was a player.

6030
03:31:13,340 --> 03:31:14,880
Yeah, yeah.

6031
03:31:15,480 --> 03:31:19,180
But if you're winning in Plat, Lobbystar, you're better than Plat players?

6032
03:31:20,040 --> 03:31:22,960
Yes, that means you're technically a Diamond player.

6033
03:31:25,100 --> 03:31:26,820
Why do you have Team Liquid banner?

6034
03:31:27,340 --> 03:31:27,980
Wait, who?

6035
03:31:28,560 --> 03:31:29,120
Me?

6036
03:31:29,620 --> 03:31:30,480
Yeah, I don't know.

6037
03:31:30,600 --> 03:31:33,280
Oh, he wants to support Team Liquid.

6038
03:31:33,420 --> 03:31:33,960
Do you like Team Liquid the most?

6039
03:31:35,560 --> 03:31:37,480
Oh, I was...

6040
03:31:37,480 --> 03:31:42,440
Like, it was before when Noq was on Team Liquid when I bought it.

6041
03:31:43,340 --> 03:31:44,520
Oh, so you're supporting...

6042
03:31:45,080 --> 03:31:45,560
Yeah.

6043
03:31:45,840 --> 03:31:47,520
Don't they get less of a cut?

6044
03:31:48,880 --> 03:31:51,120
I don't even know if they got a cut.

6045
03:31:51,260 --> 03:31:52,360
Yeah, I don't think they get, do you?

6046
03:31:55,480 --> 03:31:57,200
You know what's funny?

6047
03:31:57,440 --> 03:31:58,520
Those skins...

6048
03:31:58,520 --> 03:32:04,900
Those banners came out while we were playing ALGS so we couldn't buy them.

6049
03:32:06,560 --> 03:32:07,740
We couldn't get them.

6050
03:32:07,960 --> 03:32:09,260
We couldn't get our own banners.

6051
03:32:09,260 --> 03:32:09,960
We literally didn't buy them.

6052
03:32:10,840 --> 03:32:12,300
Because it wasn't on...

6053
03:32:12,300 --> 03:32:14,760
It also wasn't on their accounts because they had LAN.

6054
03:32:16,800 --> 03:32:18,560
Yeah, because with LAN you could play...

6055
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:19,500
Oh, were you in more?

6056
03:32:19,580 --> 03:32:19,780
Alright.

6057
03:32:21,200 --> 03:32:23,100
You play on like special...

6058
03:32:23,100 --> 03:32:24,600
special accounts.

6059
03:32:24,740 --> 03:32:25,680
You don't play on your own accounts.

6060
03:32:25,840 --> 03:32:29,580
You play on like EA provided accounts with all the skins enabled and shit.

6061
03:32:30,580 --> 03:32:31,020
Yeah.

6062
03:32:34,150 --> 03:32:35,290
That's basically it.

6063
03:32:35,330 --> 03:32:35,850
I agree.

6064
03:32:37,570 --> 03:32:47,590
I wanted to buy like at least some of them but I couldn't when I got back home it was gone.

6065
03:32:48,930 --> 03:32:49,590
Wait, really?

6066
03:32:49,810 --> 03:32:50,430
It was that short?

6067
03:32:52,910 --> 03:32:54,010
It was that...

6068
03:32:54,470 --> 03:32:55,550
It ended that fast?

6069
03:32:55,970 --> 03:32:57,590
I thought it lasted longer.

6070
03:32:57,870 --> 03:32:58,810
Didn't they bring it back?

6071
03:33:01,850 --> 03:33:03,930
I thought they brought it back for a bit.

6072
03:33:05,410 --> 03:33:06,630
No, because I would have bought it.

6073
03:33:10,630 --> 03:33:10,770
Yeah.

6074
03:33:10,890 --> 03:33:13,970
I can't...

6075
03:33:13,970 --> 03:33:14,730
I'm mad.

6076
03:33:14,830 --> 03:33:15,710
I'm still mad about that one.

6077
03:33:16,610 --> 03:33:17,150
Damn.

6078
03:33:17,830 --> 03:33:18,570
It's alright.

6079
03:33:18,850 --> 03:33:21,970
You gotta look at my screenshot, Doki.

6080
03:33:22,190 --> 03:33:22,630
Whoa.

6081
03:33:24,010 --> 03:33:24,790
What screenshot?

6082
03:33:26,330 --> 03:33:27,150
Your bald.

6083
03:33:27,530 --> 03:33:28,390
Oh, you are.

6084
03:33:32,350 --> 03:33:33,610
You don't have your...

6085
03:33:33,610 --> 03:33:34,390
You don't have hair.

6086
03:33:36,670 --> 03:33:39,450
It's crazy that you guys have to photoshop that shit.

6087
03:33:40,750 --> 03:33:42,090
It's not photoshopping.

6088
03:33:42,110 --> 03:33:42,690
It's in-game.

6089
03:33:44,030 --> 03:33:50,470
Okay, why does he take the helmet off when you're on your POV but on my POV he's just standing here like some fucking... He's embarrassed.

6090
03:33:52,530 --> 03:33:55,710
He's on my POV he's just standing like some kind of Avenger.

6091
03:33:56,150 --> 03:33:58,450
Like with his arms on his hips like...

6092
03:33:59,670 --> 03:34:01,810
And he'll be able to take your helmet off.

6093
03:34:04,030 --> 03:34:05,710
Uncle without his helmet.

6094
03:34:05,930 --> 03:34:06,570
It's a choice.

6095
03:34:06,770 --> 03:34:10,330
Alright, this is my LG It's almost 3 in the morning, guys.

6096
03:34:11,190 --> 03:34:11,590
Yeah.

6097
03:34:11,790 --> 03:34:12,910
I can feel about it.

6098
03:34:14,930 --> 03:34:16,470
This is my LG.

6099
03:34:16,890 --> 03:34:18,570
Alright, we gotta win this one.

6100
03:34:18,570 --> 03:34:19,450
We gotta win another one.

6101
03:34:19,510 --> 03:34:20,070
Two in a row.

6102
03:34:21,150 --> 03:34:23,190
See, when we're serious we can win games.

6103
03:34:23,930 --> 03:34:26,250
It's so hard to be serious in rank, you know?

6104
03:34:26,950 --> 03:34:28,970
It's so hard to be serious in rank.

6105
03:34:29,290 --> 03:34:29,750
It's not.

6106
03:34:29,810 --> 03:34:32,710
How do you get serious in rank?

6107
03:34:32,730 --> 03:34:34,390
How do you get serious in rank?

6108
03:34:34,430 --> 03:34:35,090
You know, that's annoying.

6109
03:34:37,490 --> 03:34:38,630
We don't even better.

6110
03:34:38,710 --> 03:34:40,850
That means like when we're not serious we're winning.

6111
03:34:42,470 --> 03:34:44,830
We just lock in in the last two squads.

6112
03:34:44,890 --> 03:34:45,070
That's all.

6113
03:34:45,350 --> 03:34:47,110
We just lock in when there's last two.

6114
03:34:47,330 --> 03:34:51,230
Like tourneys and like costumes, you never like get to be serious in rank.

6115
03:34:51,230 --> 03:34:52,050
It's so hard.

6116
03:34:52,530 --> 03:34:53,310
That's so true.

6117
03:34:54,830 --> 03:34:55,830
Oh look, that's you.

6118
03:34:55,890 --> 03:34:59,090
Look, see Rusty has top fragger cause he locked in.

6119
03:35:01,170 --> 03:35:02,330
After we like...

6120
03:35:02,330 --> 03:35:04,430
My serious in rank is probably... Alright, I'll be serious.

6121
03:35:04,430 --> 03:35:06,910
And that's like everyone and ending.

6122
03:35:07,050 --> 03:35:09,990
Except when he gets flanked by a robot.

6123
03:35:12,230 --> 03:35:14,130
That's really the point.

6124
03:35:14,250 --> 03:35:15,310
It's so scary.

6125
03:35:15,570 --> 03:35:16,370
It's horrible.

6126
03:35:16,410 --> 03:35:20,390
I think the worst one right now on footsteps is Ashe.

6127
03:35:20,830 --> 03:35:22,750
He has no footsteps at all.

6128
03:35:23,130 --> 03:35:23,890
That's fucked.

6129
03:35:24,290 --> 03:35:25,470
Why are we playing Ashe?

6130
03:35:25,490 --> 03:35:26,530
That's crazy cause like on the...

6131
03:35:28,930 --> 03:35:31,710
Like before, like Ashe has the biggest footsteps.

6132
03:35:31,810 --> 03:35:33,810
Yeah, before she was like clink, clink, clink.

6133
03:35:33,810 --> 03:35:34,110
Yeah.

6134
03:35:34,430 --> 03:35:35,550
I remember that too.

6135
03:35:36,710 --> 03:35:38,210
And now you don't hear the clinks.

6136
03:35:39,350 --> 03:35:40,230
Non-existent.

6137
03:35:40,270 --> 03:35:42,590
I heard something like somebody behind me.

6138
03:35:42,730 --> 03:35:44,330
Oh no, not behind me.

6139
03:35:44,410 --> 03:35:46,010
Like literally in front of me.

6140
03:35:46,050 --> 03:35:46,390
Oh my god.

6141
03:35:46,390 --> 03:35:46,950
He's one, he's one.

6142
03:35:47,930 --> 03:35:48,510
That's the front behind.

6143
03:35:48,510 --> 03:35:48,910
That's the front behind.

6144
03:35:49,090 --> 03:35:49,810
There's also more there.

6145
03:35:49,970 --> 03:35:51,930
I know and I'm fucking dead.

6146
03:35:54,170 --> 03:35:55,630
I know like one of them was low.

6147
03:35:56,450 --> 03:35:57,830
Literally one HP right now.

6148
03:35:59,070 --> 03:35:59,910
One's on Rusty.

6149
03:36:01,730 --> 03:36:02,570
One's on this door.

6150
03:36:02,710 --> 03:36:03,470
One's on that door.

6151
03:36:03,910 --> 03:36:04,350
Okay.

6152
03:36:04,430 --> 03:36:08,090
I almost got him.

6153
03:36:08,150 --> 03:36:08,370
Nice.

6154
03:36:09,790 --> 03:36:10,370
I believe.

6155
03:36:10,890 --> 03:36:11,730
I'm so safe.

6156
03:36:11,850 --> 03:36:12,410
On the roof, Horizon.

6157
03:36:12,890 --> 03:36:13,530
Horizon's on the roof.

6158
03:36:13,710 --> 03:36:15,470
There's no way they drop down just to kill you.

6159
03:36:15,590 --> 03:36:16,230
There's no way.

6160
03:36:16,670 --> 03:36:17,310
Horizon cracked.

6161
03:36:17,910 --> 03:36:18,450
I'm fucked.

6162
03:36:18,750 --> 03:36:19,710
Okay, I need to heal.

6163
03:36:19,790 --> 03:36:20,230
I'm healing.

6164
03:36:23,030 --> 03:36:24,330
I'm gonna pop a Phoenix, Rusty.

6165
03:36:24,490 --> 03:36:25,070
Yeah, Rusty.

6166
03:36:25,090 --> 03:36:25,590
You got this.

6167
03:36:25,590 --> 03:36:25,990
Lock in.

6168
03:36:26,410 --> 03:36:27,050
He got one.

6169
03:36:27,050 --> 03:36:27,550
He got one though.

6170
03:36:27,850 --> 03:36:28,670
There's only one left.

6171
03:36:28,730 --> 03:36:29,210
Only Poppin left.

6172
03:36:29,330 --> 03:36:29,530
Yeah.

6173
03:36:32,470 --> 03:36:32,990
Rusty, no.

6174
03:36:34,110 --> 03:36:34,690
Rusty, no.

6175
03:36:35,010 --> 03:36:36,630
I don't have shields but I'm heading over.

6176
03:36:37,010 --> 03:36:37,410
No!

6177
03:36:39,090 --> 03:36:40,190
I finished one.

6178
03:36:42,130 --> 03:36:42,790
I got...

6179
03:36:42,790 --> 03:36:43,630
I got his banner.

6180
03:36:45,890 --> 03:36:46,710
I'm heading up.

6181
03:36:47,010 --> 03:36:47,810
I'm pushing up.

6182
03:36:48,130 --> 03:36:48,530
He swapped.

6183
03:36:52,090 --> 03:36:52,690
He's dead.

6184
03:36:53,510 --> 03:36:53,910
Yay!

6185
03:36:56,410 --> 03:36:58,970
Okay, I need to swap my gun.

6186
03:36:59,610 --> 03:37:00,550
Don't worry, Rusty.

6187
03:37:00,550 --> 03:37:01,290
I'm gonna res you.

6188
03:37:01,470 --> 03:37:02,150
I need to get a med kit.

6189
03:37:02,290 --> 03:37:02,970
I need to get a med kit.

6190
03:37:02,970 --> 03:37:02,970
I need to get a med kit.

6191
03:37:02,970 --> 03:37:02,970
I need to get a med kit.

6192
03:37:02,970 --> 03:37:02,970
I need to get a med kit.

6193
03:37:02,990 --> 03:37:03,090
I need to get a med kit.

6194
03:37:03,290 --> 03:37:04,310
I need to get a med kit.

6195
03:37:04,630 --> 03:37:04,970
Oops.

6196
03:37:06,250 --> 03:37:06,650
Sorry.

6197
03:37:06,810 --> 03:37:07,950
I need to pick up my stuff.

6198
03:37:08,150 --> 03:37:08,790
I got a med kit.

6199
03:37:08,910 --> 03:37:14,930
I remember when RPR promised you to play Imperial Howl.

6200
03:37:14,930 --> 03:37:15,010
I remember when RPR promised you to play Imperial Howl.

6201
03:37:15,010 --> 03:37:16,450
Did that happen, Evan?

6202
03:37:17,030 --> 03:37:17,970
Howl didn't wanna do it.

6203
03:37:18,010 --> 03:37:18,670
Don't fuck with me.

6204
03:37:21,830 --> 03:37:22,230
Damn!

6205
03:37:23,890 --> 03:37:26,290
RPR is like, Where the fuck did that come from?

6206
03:37:28,370 --> 03:37:29,330
I'm not gonna lie.

6207
03:37:29,330 --> 03:37:32,810
Do you want to hear the full story?

6208
03:37:34,430 --> 03:37:35,890
Hal said yes to it.

6209
03:37:36,630 --> 03:37:40,250
And then when he actually came to doing it, he never wanted to do it.

6210
03:37:40,370 --> 03:37:42,170
So I was just like, what am I supposed to do here?

6211
03:37:44,290 --> 03:37:44,970
Expose him!

6212
03:37:46,430 --> 03:37:51,610
He was just like, I was always either too busy or wouldn't respond to DMs or this and that.

6213
03:37:51,670 --> 03:37:54,950
I was just like, well, I tried my best to ask him like 16 times.

6214
03:37:59,130 --> 03:37:59,750
That's okay.

6215
03:37:59,790 --> 03:38:02,850
Usually when I fucking schedule shit, you know, it goes through.

6216
03:38:02,930 --> 03:38:05,230
But that one just didn't want to go through.

6217
03:38:05,350 --> 03:38:05,850
It wasn't destined.

6218
03:38:06,950 --> 03:38:07,570
That's okay.

6219
03:38:07,730 --> 03:38:10,350
In the end, I eventually played with him.

6220
03:38:13,470 --> 03:38:22,530
But I don't want people to sit here and be like, oh, you didn't even drive.

6221
03:38:22,710 --> 03:38:23,470
You lied.

6222
03:38:23,650 --> 03:38:24,410
Like nah, motherfucker.

6223
03:38:24,590 --> 03:38:25,210
I fucking tried.

6224
03:38:25,470 --> 03:38:26,510
And I communicated.

6225
03:38:26,990 --> 03:38:28,670
With you the entire time.

6226
03:38:28,850 --> 03:38:29,330
Yeah.

6227
03:38:31,130 --> 03:38:32,430
Yeah, he did.

6228
03:38:33,630 --> 03:38:35,850
Oh, what a nice guy, RPR.

6229
03:38:36,090 --> 03:38:36,310
Yeah.

6230
03:38:36,930 --> 03:38:38,090
So late to know.

6231
03:38:39,630 --> 03:38:42,110
You were a nice guy all the time.

6232
03:38:42,110 --> 03:38:43,270
Well, um...

6233
03:38:45,290 --> 03:38:47,030
I won't say that, but...

6234
03:38:47,030 --> 03:38:47,530
I can't win.

6235
03:38:47,810 --> 03:38:48,450
I can't win.

6236
03:38:49,250 --> 03:38:52,550
Like, what's the point of even talking when I can win?

6237
03:38:54,630 --> 03:38:55,710
Give me a shotgun.

6238
03:38:57,090 --> 03:38:57,930
I have...

6239
03:38:57,930 --> 03:38:59,730
No, why don't you give me a Mosam?

6240
03:39:00,710 --> 03:39:02,110
Like ping me any shotgun.

6241
03:39:02,310 --> 03:39:04,570
If you find a Mosam, I'll give you my Mosam.

6242
03:39:05,730 --> 03:39:06,830
I want anything.

6243
03:39:07,070 --> 03:39:10,130
I'll take PK, I'll take EVA, I'll take Master, just any shotgun.

6244
03:39:12,330 --> 03:39:13,450
We'll ping you one.

6245
03:39:13,750 --> 03:39:14,170
Yeah.

6246
03:39:14,170 --> 03:39:14,590
Good guy.

6247
03:39:14,830 --> 03:39:17,450
Yeah, because you're such a good guy.

6248
03:39:19,070 --> 03:39:20,530
I fucking hate you guys.

6249
03:39:21,190 --> 03:39:22,350
What did we say?

6250
03:39:22,890 --> 03:39:23,850
What do you mean?

6251
03:39:24,030 --> 03:39:24,450
See?

6252
03:39:24,450 --> 03:39:27,450
We literally pinged you a shotgun.

6253
03:39:28,130 --> 03:39:28,590
Yeah.

6254
03:39:28,730 --> 03:39:33,490
The last thing a person wants is backhanded compliments.

6255
03:39:34,050 --> 03:39:35,450
That's not backhanded.

6256
03:39:35,630 --> 03:39:39,550
We were literally complimenting you and you just can't take a compliment.

6257
03:39:42,870 --> 03:39:43,990
It's like talking to a wall.

6258
03:39:47,190 --> 03:39:49,810
If you're going to say words, at least believe in them yourself.

6259
03:39:50,050 --> 03:39:51,230
I do believe in them.

6260
03:39:51,250 --> 03:39:52,130
It was so sincere.

6261
03:39:53,970 --> 03:39:54,430
Yeah.

6262
03:39:54,450 --> 03:39:55,170
My ass.

6263
03:39:55,210 --> 03:39:56,010
Any shotgun ammo?

6264
03:39:58,110 --> 03:39:59,630
I'm going to get this bat.

6265
03:39:59,890 --> 03:40:00,510
Oh, okay.

6266
03:40:01,130 --> 03:40:01,710
Don't worry.

6267
03:40:01,830 --> 03:40:05,730
As a team player, I'm literally right behind you and then we'll aim together.

6268
03:40:07,330 --> 03:40:08,770
How many do you need?

6269
03:40:09,470 --> 03:40:10,270
I'm good now.

6270
03:40:10,350 --> 03:40:10,670
I got 10.

6271
03:40:11,910 --> 03:40:12,570
Oh, shit.

6272
03:40:12,710 --> 03:40:13,650
That's not inting.

6273
03:40:13,790 --> 03:40:14,230
That was...

6274
03:40:14,230 --> 03:40:14,790
Damn, Chris.

6275
03:40:15,810 --> 03:40:16,910
Damn, poor Chris.

6276
03:40:16,990 --> 03:40:17,350
This is crazy.

6277
03:40:17,710 --> 03:40:18,070
Wait.

6278
03:40:18,110 --> 03:40:19,690
What is this silver player doing in our lobby?

6279
03:40:21,130 --> 03:40:21,470
Oh, wait.

6280
03:40:21,510 --> 03:40:22,330
His teammate is in here.

6281
03:40:22,990 --> 03:40:23,870
Oh, shit.

6282
03:40:23,870 --> 03:40:24,330
That's...

6283
03:40:24,330 --> 03:40:24,530
Whoa.

6284
03:40:25,650 --> 03:40:29,030
Whoever that is, that motherfucker is just...

6285
03:40:29,970 --> 03:40:30,930
You said...

6286
03:40:30,930 --> 03:40:31,910
He's crying.

6287
03:40:32,330 --> 03:40:32,350
He's ready.

6288
03:40:32,950 --> 03:40:33,430
Yeah.

6289
03:40:35,490 --> 03:40:36,270
I'm coming in.

6290
03:40:38,410 --> 03:40:39,270
Oh my God.

6291
03:40:39,410 --> 03:40:40,150
What the fuck?

6292
03:40:41,910 --> 03:40:42,870
Holy shit.

6293
03:40:42,930 --> 03:40:43,590
You like throw.

6294
03:40:44,250 --> 03:40:48,630
You fucking jumped in and booped the guy I was trying to kill.

6295
03:40:48,950 --> 03:40:50,530
That scared the shit out of me.

6296
03:40:50,710 --> 03:40:53,550
Listen, I was getting on rest here because I thought rest was something so hard.

6297
03:40:53,550 --> 03:40:53,850
Oh, come on.

6298
03:40:56,610 --> 03:40:57,010
What?

6299
03:40:57,010 --> 03:40:57,410
What?

6300
03:40:57,510 --> 03:40:58,070
You heard something?

6301
03:40:59,050 --> 03:40:59,450
No.

6302
03:41:00,010 --> 03:41:01,130
There's a face kit for you.

6303
03:41:01,790 --> 03:41:03,330
Golden Akeem buzzin is mad.

6304
03:41:03,430 --> 03:41:06,850
Yeah, that Golden Akeem buzzin got yoinked so fast.

6305
03:41:07,690 --> 03:41:09,750
How did you lose to someone with a 250 thing?

6306
03:41:10,870 --> 03:41:13,810
Says the guy that might lose.

6307
03:41:14,050 --> 03:41:15,070
I have a redeploy.

6308
03:41:15,170 --> 03:41:15,830
I want to use that.

6309
03:41:17,270 --> 03:41:18,230
I need a med kit.

6310
03:41:18,390 --> 03:41:18,930
I have no med kits.

6311
03:41:19,850 --> 03:41:20,830
Here, I have a med kit.

6312
03:41:22,050 --> 03:41:23,050
Oh, that's fine.

6313
03:41:23,050 --> 03:41:24,050
I'm going to go this way.

6314
03:41:27,070 --> 03:41:29,030
Guys, I'm going to be safe.

6315
03:41:29,870 --> 03:41:30,970
Are they rushing in?

6316
03:41:31,330 --> 03:41:32,050
No, they're not.

6317
03:41:32,150 --> 03:41:33,290
I have no idea what they're doing.

6318
03:41:33,590 --> 03:41:36,150
They're literally waiting outside of zone for us.

6319
03:41:36,750 --> 03:41:37,770
Then we can kill them.

6320
03:41:38,050 --> 03:41:38,410
Yeah.

6321
03:41:41,790 --> 03:41:42,770
I'm heading over.

6322
03:41:46,820 --> 03:41:48,180
I'm getting so many med kits.

6323
03:41:48,420 --> 03:41:49,380
I have redeploy.

6324
03:41:50,160 --> 03:41:51,140
Do we want that?

6325
03:41:51,180 --> 03:41:51,980
I have five med kits.

6326
03:41:52,060 --> 03:41:52,880
I can be here forever.

6327
03:41:56,460 --> 03:41:58,900
I need energy ammo.

6328
03:42:00,060 --> 03:42:04,000
Someone in my chat said, just want you to know that she ran by six shotguns and didn't ping a single one.

6329
03:42:08,140 --> 03:42:09,080
Team player, right?

6330
03:42:09,920 --> 03:42:15,140
I don't need to ping any because Restia was pinging them, and I believe that you saw Restia's...

6331
03:42:15,140 --> 03:42:15,460
Oh, so that's how it works.

6332
03:42:15,860 --> 03:42:18,000
I know you saw Restia's ping.

6333
03:42:18,100 --> 03:42:19,520
So why would I ping you more shotgun?

6334
03:42:19,740 --> 03:42:20,360
You only need one.

6335
03:42:20,480 --> 03:42:21,240
You're right, you're right.

6336
03:42:21,360 --> 03:42:22,880
You don't need to do shit for the team.

6337
03:42:22,940 --> 03:42:23,200
You're right.

6338
03:42:23,700 --> 03:42:24,400
I stopped thinking.

6339
03:42:24,400 --> 03:42:24,400
You're right.

6340
03:42:24,400 --> 03:42:24,400
You're right.

6341
03:42:24,400 --> 03:42:25,160
It's not that I don't need to do shit.

6342
03:42:25,260 --> 03:42:27,000
I know my team has already done stuff.

6343
03:42:28,480 --> 03:42:29,180
Oh, you're right.

6344
03:42:30,340 --> 03:42:31,300
Thank you for agreeing.

6345
03:42:34,560 --> 03:42:35,560
That's one, by the way.

6346
03:42:36,200 --> 03:42:36,960
Oh, never mind.

6347
03:42:38,240 --> 03:42:38,960
Yeah, yeah.

6348
03:42:40,360 --> 03:42:41,740
Where did that Venture go?

6349
03:42:45,520 --> 03:42:46,160
Wait, he's one.

6350
03:42:48,860 --> 03:42:49,440
There we go.

6351
03:42:50,380 --> 03:42:51,820
There's a Horizon that was one here.

6352
03:42:52,200 --> 03:42:53,520
At least I think she was a Horizon.

6353
03:42:53,680 --> 03:42:54,900
Oh, hey, you have a gold ratio.

6354
03:42:56,580 --> 03:42:57,900
There's a gold ratio for you.

6355
03:42:59,920 --> 03:43:00,420
That's sick.

6356
03:43:00,480 --> 03:43:01,320
How long did you have that one?

6357
03:43:01,700 --> 03:43:03,480
Oh, look, it's not even on my body.

6358
03:43:03,600 --> 03:43:06,040
It's literally a guy that just died that I killed.

6359
03:43:06,060 --> 03:43:06,560
Yeah, yeah, but look.

6360
03:43:08,040 --> 03:43:09,240
How long did you have that one?

6361
03:43:10,100 --> 03:43:11,440
Nothing to say about that.

6362
03:43:12,300 --> 03:43:13,560
How long was it there?

6363
03:43:14,140 --> 03:43:15,360
Literally just killed him.

6364
03:43:15,500 --> 03:43:18,280
I saw him using it to block my shots.

6365
03:43:18,340 --> 03:43:23,340
I was like, whoa, that's something that my teammate, who is Newcastle, would definitely want.

6366
03:43:23,640 --> 03:43:24,800
Because I'm a team player.

6367
03:43:27,600 --> 03:43:29,660
So if I check your VOD, that would be...

6368
03:43:29,660 --> 03:43:30,660
Yeah, no, check it.

6369
03:43:30,740 --> 03:43:31,320
Watch my VOD.

6370
03:43:31,400 --> 03:43:32,380
Give me that plus one view.

6371
03:43:32,700 --> 03:43:34,680
I encourage you to watch it.

6372
03:43:35,460 --> 03:43:39,120
No, no, I'll watch it after the stream is over.

6373
03:43:39,840 --> 03:43:40,600
You know what?

6374
03:43:40,640 --> 03:43:42,140
I'm going to fucking get the Zombo.

6375
03:43:43,640 --> 03:43:45,160
This guy ran away with one HP.

6376
03:43:45,260 --> 03:43:46,040
I don't know where he went though.

6377
03:43:46,340 --> 03:43:47,860
Is there a sniper stock anywhere?

6378
03:43:49,560 --> 03:43:50,060
Hold on.

6379
03:43:50,080 --> 03:43:50,360
This one.

6380
03:43:50,360 --> 03:43:51,040
You all just killed us.

6381
03:43:51,100 --> 03:43:51,640
Sad face.

6382
03:43:52,200 --> 03:43:52,900
My bad.

6383
03:43:53,960 --> 03:43:54,840
What did we kill?

6384
03:43:55,020 --> 03:43:56,420
You don't even feel sorry for them.

6385
03:43:56,480 --> 03:43:57,880
You don't even feel sorry for him.

6386
03:43:57,940 --> 03:43:59,060
That's so fucked up.

6387
03:43:59,620 --> 03:44:00,860
Well, you killed him, not me.

6388
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:01,860
Oh wait, I killed him?

6389
03:44:02,000 --> 03:44:03,040
I don't feel sorry.

6390
03:44:05,960 --> 03:44:07,800
Yeah, I like the honesty.

6391
03:44:09,820 --> 03:44:11,680
I mean, it's not like I would feel sorry.

6392
03:44:12,960 --> 03:44:14,740
It's better than like a fake I'm sorry.

6393
03:44:14,840 --> 03:44:15,300
Yeah, exactly.

6394
03:44:15,720 --> 03:44:18,400
I just want him to know that I'm real.

6395
03:44:18,560 --> 03:44:19,100
I'm the realest.

6396
03:44:19,100 --> 03:44:20,960
Yeah, I mean, you know, formalities and shit.

6397
03:44:21,120 --> 03:44:21,700
I said sorry.

6398
03:44:21,880 --> 03:44:22,600
I don't have to mean it.

6399
03:44:23,460 --> 03:44:23,820
Whoa.

6400
03:44:23,820 --> 03:44:24,580
Yes, you do.

6401
03:44:24,820 --> 03:44:25,780
And you're a faker.

6402
03:44:25,940 --> 03:44:26,440
No, I don't.

6403
03:44:27,180 --> 03:44:27,800
You're a fucking faker.

6404
03:44:27,800 --> 03:44:29,020
I'm literally a faker of this game.

6405
03:44:30,200 --> 03:44:32,180
You're a faker of this game.

6406
03:44:33,740 --> 03:44:35,680
You'd have more than one championship win.

6407
03:44:36,960 --> 03:44:37,320
I am a faker.

6408
03:44:37,320 --> 03:44:37,380
Okay.

6409
03:44:44,280 --> 03:44:48,560
So would you say Imperial Holly is a faker of the game or Zero is a faker of this game?

6410
03:44:49,380 --> 03:44:50,140
Here we go.

6411
03:44:50,200 --> 03:44:50,740
Start some drama.

6412
03:44:51,180 --> 03:44:53,300
Tell me none of them because Faker will rage.

6413
03:44:53,420 --> 03:44:54,180
Yeah, neither.

6414
03:44:58,440 --> 03:45:00,160
Faker literally would not rage.

6415
03:45:00,340 --> 03:45:01,180
That's so true.

6416
03:45:01,240 --> 03:45:02,200
He's too chill for that.

6417
03:45:03,780 --> 03:45:05,580
I feel like he's not though.

6418
03:45:07,080 --> 03:45:09,600
He cares about the game but he's not a nice guy.

6419
03:45:09,600 --> 03:45:12,380
He doesn't yell at his teammates like they do.

6420
03:45:13,200 --> 03:45:14,200
Okay, there's a Kraber.

6421
03:45:14,420 --> 03:45:14,860
Whoa!

6422
03:45:14,880 --> 03:45:16,400
No one does that to his teammates.

6423
03:45:18,880 --> 03:45:19,820
So none of them...

6424
03:45:19,820 --> 03:45:20,920
Wait, there's two Rizzes.

6425
03:45:21,020 --> 03:45:22,100
Are we going for the first Rizz?

6426
03:45:22,920 --> 03:45:23,280
No.

6427
03:45:23,700 --> 03:45:25,160
There's people fighting on this side of the wall.

6428
03:45:25,520 --> 03:45:26,440
Yeah, I heard it.

6429
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:27,660
Yeah, me too.

6430
03:45:28,080 --> 03:45:29,780
Wait, what the fuck?

6431
03:45:29,840 --> 03:45:30,940
I got shot from behind.

6432
03:45:31,260 --> 03:45:31,360
Yeah.

6433
03:45:32,260 --> 03:45:32,920
I'm in gas.

6434
03:45:35,540 --> 03:45:36,320
I need a bat.

6435
03:45:36,420 --> 03:45:36,720
I'm in gas.

6436
03:45:37,280 --> 03:45:38,620
Where is this gas coming from?

6437
03:45:38,940 --> 03:45:39,800
Behind you, literally.

6438
03:45:41,220 --> 03:45:42,020
Ash is cracked.

6439
03:45:43,420 --> 03:45:44,520
Ash is low.

6440
03:45:45,220 --> 03:45:45,920
Where is he?

6441
03:45:46,040 --> 03:45:46,460
Behind the bins.

6442
03:45:47,300 --> 03:45:47,820
Behind the mythic bin.

6443
03:45:47,880 --> 03:45:47,940
Oh, nice.

6444
03:45:49,620 --> 03:45:50,580
That's fucking right.

6445
03:45:50,700 --> 03:45:51,780
That's for flanking us.

6446
03:45:54,260 --> 03:45:55,240
Where did the other guy go?

6447
03:45:55,860 --> 03:45:56,900
Probably under.

6448
03:45:57,160 --> 03:45:58,100
Right here, right here, right here.

6449
03:45:58,340 --> 03:45:59,280
Oh, alright.

6450
03:46:00,380 --> 03:46:00,900
Lifeline.

6451
03:46:01,660 --> 03:46:02,800
Behind this rock?

6452
03:46:02,980 --> 03:46:03,200
Alright.

6453
03:46:04,260 --> 03:46:05,300
Hello, lifeline.

6454
03:46:06,780 --> 03:46:07,300
Lifeline?

6455
03:46:07,800 --> 03:46:08,480
Above you.

6456
03:46:09,700 --> 03:46:10,540
Knocked one.

6457
03:46:12,200 --> 03:46:13,200
Alright, batting.

6458
03:46:16,360 --> 03:46:16,880
I'm batting.

6459
03:46:16,880 --> 03:46:17,000
Flying above.

6460
03:46:17,880 --> 03:46:19,520
Make sure you're dead, dead.

6461
03:46:20,660 --> 03:46:22,240
Oh, he has gold.

6462
03:46:22,300 --> 03:46:22,780
Nice.

6463
03:46:23,920 --> 03:46:24,820
That guy is cracked.

6464
03:46:25,520 --> 03:46:26,460
Oh, shit.

6465
03:46:26,520 --> 03:46:28,200
How many?

6466
03:46:28,360 --> 03:46:28,640
How many?

6467
03:46:29,240 --> 03:46:30,000
Two, two, two.

6468
03:46:30,160 --> 03:46:32,560
I got one.

6469
03:46:33,940 --> 03:46:34,540
I'm not.

6470
03:46:35,080 --> 03:46:36,100
I'm spotting.

6471
03:46:37,920 --> 03:46:38,880
He's flashed, though.

6472
03:46:38,900 --> 03:46:41,200
I'm batting.

6473
03:46:41,200 --> 03:46:41,900
I'm batting.

6474
03:46:42,000 --> 03:46:43,480
He has hammerpoint, he has hammerpoint.

6475
03:46:44,320 --> 03:46:44,760
It's okay.

6476
03:46:44,820 --> 03:46:45,380
I have gold rest.

6477
03:46:45,440 --> 03:46:45,920
I have gold rest.

6478
03:46:46,080 --> 03:46:46,920
Who cares about him?

6479
03:46:48,540 --> 03:46:50,320
I'm just fucking stopping the lifeline rest.

6480
03:46:51,500 --> 03:46:52,920
That's why I'm the team player.

6481
03:46:54,660 --> 03:46:56,280
Dude, there is a lifeline is happening.

6482
03:46:56,400 --> 03:46:57,160
I'm coming from this angle.

6483
03:46:57,240 --> 03:46:57,980
From this angle.

6484
03:46:58,200 --> 03:46:59,600
Oh, my God.

6485
03:46:59,640 --> 03:47:00,040
What the fuck?

6486
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:01,820
Yeah, he is.

6487
03:47:01,900 --> 03:47:02,660
What the fuck?

6488
03:47:02,840 --> 03:47:03,500
Oh, my God.

6489
03:47:03,500 --> 03:47:03,980
There's so much.

6490
03:47:04,040 --> 03:47:05,200
Horizon, horizon, horizon.

6491
03:47:05,580 --> 03:47:06,300
Oh, my God.

6492
03:47:06,660 --> 03:47:07,080
There's two.

6493
03:47:07,260 --> 03:47:07,680
There's two.

6494
03:47:08,900 --> 03:47:09,780
Look at this guy.

6495
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:10,260
Look at this idiot.

6496
03:47:11,320 --> 03:47:12,900
I'm going to go res if I can.

6497
03:47:13,580 --> 03:47:13,980
Cover.

6498
03:47:14,600 --> 03:47:15,440
Smoke us, maybe.

6499
03:47:15,580 --> 03:47:16,940
No, no, maybe.

6500
03:47:17,880 --> 03:47:18,560
Smoke, smoke, smoke.

6501
03:47:18,560 --> 03:47:19,260
Just smoke.

6502
03:47:19,660 --> 03:47:22,080
Oh, my God.

6503
03:47:22,140 --> 03:47:23,100
There's a fucking...

6504
03:47:23,100 --> 03:47:24,680
There's a... God, stay calm.

6505
03:47:24,900 --> 03:47:26,600
Smoke again right here, doc, and res.

6506
03:47:26,700 --> 03:47:27,440
I don't have smoke.

6507
03:47:27,600 --> 03:47:28,000
I don't have smoke.

6508
03:47:29,000 --> 03:47:30,360
Okay, now I do.

6509
03:47:30,960 --> 03:47:32,240
Okay, big.

6510
03:47:33,240 --> 03:47:34,260
Look, I'm even healing.

6511
03:47:35,300 --> 03:47:37,840
I'm even healing in my smoke because you taught me that.

6512
03:47:39,240 --> 03:47:39,640
Yup.

6513
03:47:39,640 --> 03:47:40,460
There's someone on us.

6514
03:47:40,520 --> 03:47:40,960
Someone is on us.

6515
03:47:41,200 --> 03:47:41,620
On the wall, on the wall, on the wall.

6516
03:47:42,700 --> 03:47:43,520
Flash, flash, flash, flash.

6517
03:47:43,900 --> 03:47:44,720
One's flash, one's flash.

6518
03:47:46,100 --> 03:47:46,720
Nice, nice, nice.

6519
03:47:46,820 --> 03:47:47,440
Nice, nice, nice.

6520
03:47:47,660 --> 03:47:48,440
I'm stuck on a...

6521
03:47:48,880 --> 03:47:51,060
Dude, this game is so bugged.

6522
03:47:51,060 --> 03:47:51,720
Last guy, last guy.

6523
03:47:52,780 --> 03:47:53,640
He's super far.

6524
03:47:53,720 --> 03:47:54,100
Super far.

6525
03:47:54,160 --> 03:47:54,620
He's just watching.

6526
03:47:54,720 --> 03:47:55,100
He's going up.

6527
03:47:56,740 --> 03:47:57,960
Oh, you don't have gold res.

6528
03:48:00,340 --> 03:48:00,980
Oh, my...

6529
03:48:00,980 --> 03:48:01,940
I got three res.

6530
03:48:02,620 --> 03:48:08,620
I got the bug where you reload your Mozams and then you shoot one bullet and then it reloads them again, bro.

6531
03:48:08,620 --> 03:48:09,640
Oh, my god.

6532
03:48:09,700 --> 03:48:11,340
We gotta do another.

6533
03:48:11,960 --> 03:48:13,980
Alright, I'll do... This is the LG.

6534
03:48:14,220 --> 03:48:16,200
Alright, redemption arc for RPI.

6535
03:48:17,520 --> 03:48:18,780
That's so annoying.

6536
03:48:21,820 --> 03:48:22,900
The collab.

6537
03:48:23,020 --> 03:48:23,820
We got collab.

6538
03:48:24,000 --> 03:48:25,420
There's another Kraber.

6539
03:48:26,350 --> 03:48:27,640
Yeah, because mythic bins.

6540
03:48:28,080 --> 03:48:28,780
God damn.

6541
03:48:29,720 --> 03:48:31,120
Wait, I think he's dead.

6542
03:48:32,300 --> 03:48:32,920
Unless...

6543
03:48:34,440 --> 03:48:35,060
Oh...

6544
03:48:35,060 --> 03:48:36,760
You got another collab?

6545
03:48:38,960 --> 03:48:39,400
Woah.

6546
03:48:40,780 --> 03:48:41,220
Oh.

6547
03:48:41,220 --> 03:48:42,320
Wait, he can res himself?

6548
03:48:42,460 --> 03:48:42,620
Oh.

6549
03:48:43,060 --> 03:48:43,960
No, he's dead.

6550
03:48:46,400 --> 03:48:48,000
I can't believe I got that shit...

6551
03:48:48,440 --> 03:48:49,860
The fucking stupid Mozam.

6552
03:48:50,580 --> 03:48:53,440
Someone which has like, what was the bug that made him not res?

6553
03:48:55,260 --> 03:48:55,940
No, but...

6554
03:48:55,940 --> 03:49:00,600
Okay, why would I res you there when I can kill their lifeline that's going for a res?

6555
03:49:00,700 --> 03:49:04,080
Yeah, but if you trusted res you could have got it.

6556
03:49:04,460 --> 03:49:05,460
If it's a...

6557
03:49:05,980 --> 03:49:08,060
No, I was full.

6558
03:49:08,620 --> 03:49:09,040
Yeah, he was full.

6559
03:49:09,320 --> 03:49:10,640
Yeah, he was.

6560
03:49:10,800 --> 03:49:12,500
Then why weren't you resing then?

6561
03:49:12,760 --> 03:49:14,120
I don't have a go-knock.

6562
03:49:14,500 --> 03:49:16,000
He didn't have a go-knock.

6563
03:49:16,120 --> 03:49:17,000
I don't give a fuck.

6564
03:49:17,300 --> 03:49:20,060
Yeah, but you are next to her.

6565
03:49:20,140 --> 03:49:22,060
You are next to her and I'm not.

6566
03:49:22,120 --> 03:49:24,100
I'm not going to turn around and go back and res you.

6567
03:49:24,420 --> 03:49:26,680
You turned next to her.

6568
03:49:26,900 --> 03:49:28,360
You turned next to her.

6569
03:49:28,700 --> 03:49:29,260
You turned next to her.

6570
03:49:30,780 --> 03:49:31,220
Okay.

6571
03:49:32,820 --> 03:49:33,660
What do you mean?

6572
03:49:33,660 --> 03:49:34,720
RPR's chat.

6573
03:49:34,800 --> 03:49:37,300
You should reset first and kill the guy.

6574
03:49:37,400 --> 03:49:40,380
That moment where he was next to us.

6575
03:49:40,620 --> 03:49:41,520
RPR's chat.

6576
03:49:44,260 --> 03:49:46,880
We both saw you next to me.

6577
03:49:47,460 --> 03:49:49,060
Why would I res?

6578
03:49:49,380 --> 03:49:49,980
Yeah.

6579
03:49:51,700 --> 03:49:54,340
There was no cover behind me.

6580
03:49:57,260 --> 03:50:02,140
You literally walked away in front of our eyes twice.

6581
03:50:02,140 --> 03:50:04,840
Once to Resdia and once to me.

6582
03:50:07,920 --> 03:50:09,120
He muted.

6583
03:50:09,700 --> 03:50:11,880
He knows he lost.

6584
03:50:11,960 --> 03:50:13,720
He knows he lost the argument.

6585
03:50:14,980 --> 03:50:16,820
Yeah, he knows he lost.

6586
03:50:19,400 --> 03:50:21,680
The throw of the century.

6587
03:50:23,260 --> 03:50:25,060
I can't believe it, Resdia.

6588
03:50:25,180 --> 03:50:26,680
And then he blamed us.

6589
03:50:28,520 --> 03:50:30,480
Why don't you res?

6590
03:50:35,020 --> 03:50:36,040
I can't believe it.

6591
03:50:36,040 --> 03:50:36,660
Alright, don't worry.

6592
03:50:37,200 --> 03:50:39,700
He's probably muting and talking to his chat now.

6593
03:50:39,720 --> 03:50:44,140
I can't believe Resdia and Doki would blame me.

6594
03:50:45,780 --> 03:50:49,380
I won the EU Championship in LAN.

6595
03:50:50,720 --> 03:50:52,900
Everything I say is correct.

6596
03:50:53,340 --> 03:50:54,800
Everything I say is correct.

6597
03:50:58,120 --> 03:50:58,720
Alright.

6598
03:50:58,820 --> 03:50:59,780
I believe in us.

6599
03:50:59,940 --> 03:51:01,760
I believe in us.

6600
03:51:04,400 --> 03:51:05,560
We got this.

6601
03:51:06,160 --> 03:51:07,200
We're gamers.

6602
03:51:09,420 --> 03:51:10,440
Remember chat?

6603
03:51:10,640 --> 03:51:11,620
He's not mad.

6604
03:51:11,720 --> 03:51:13,440
He's just European.

6605
03:51:15,240 --> 03:51:16,320
That's so racist.

6606
03:51:16,620 --> 03:51:17,380
No, it's not.

6607
03:51:18,160 --> 03:51:20,340
Is he gay or European?

6608
03:51:22,080 --> 03:51:23,560
I actually don't know this song.

6609
03:51:23,660 --> 03:51:24,120
You don't know that?

6610
03:51:24,140 --> 03:51:26,060
That's from... was it Legally Blonde?

6611
03:51:26,180 --> 03:51:27,380
That's from Legally Blonde.

6612
03:51:27,620 --> 03:51:28,540
I love that song.

6613
03:51:28,740 --> 03:51:30,160
Is he gay or European?

6614
03:51:30,660 --> 03:51:32,220
Alright, you guys done fucking yapping?

6615
03:51:33,940 --> 03:51:35,400
Is he mad or European?

6616
03:51:35,520 --> 03:51:37,240
Not seeing you guys' voices.

6617
03:51:41,920 --> 03:51:44,460
Oh my god, did you miss our voices that much to come back?

6618
03:51:45,540 --> 03:51:46,460
I can mute again.

6619
03:51:46,460 --> 03:51:47,220
Stay muted.

6620
03:51:47,800 --> 03:51:48,880
I'm really fine with that.

6621
03:51:52,400 --> 03:51:52,840
Alright.

6622
03:51:53,000 --> 03:51:53,800
Ooh, Wingman.

6623
03:51:54,000 --> 03:51:55,000
I'm not gonna hit anything.

6624
03:51:55,940 --> 03:51:59,460
What else am I supposed to do when dumb and fucking dumber are arguing when muted?

6625
03:51:59,540 --> 03:51:59,980
Wait, who's dumber?

6626
03:52:01,360 --> 03:52:02,100
Both of you.

6627
03:52:04,660 --> 03:52:05,100
Alright.

6628
03:52:09,180 --> 03:52:11,420
I wanna see how many shots I'm gonna miss on Wingman.

6629
03:52:14,060 --> 03:52:15,120
I'm not gonna contribute.

6630
03:52:15,360 --> 03:52:16,300
I have a Wingman.

6631
03:52:17,060 --> 03:52:17,900
Oh, I hit one!

6632
03:52:20,060 --> 03:52:21,080
I'm gonna charge my shield.

6633
03:52:22,040 --> 03:52:23,420
I'm doing my roof.

6634
03:52:28,750 --> 03:52:29,270
I'm healing.

6635
03:52:30,850 --> 03:52:32,170
Wait, his teammates are all here.

6636
03:52:32,530 --> 03:52:33,890
Flesh on Lifeline?

6637
03:52:33,970 --> 03:52:34,230
Yes.

6638
03:52:34,530 --> 03:52:35,450
That's how it works.

6639
03:52:35,550 --> 03:52:36,090
Team game.

6640
03:52:36,250 --> 03:52:36,710
Oh my god.

6641
03:52:37,010 --> 03:52:37,730
I don't know.

6642
03:52:37,810 --> 03:52:39,650
I never had the experience to be fair.

6643
03:52:44,350 --> 03:52:44,790
Nice.

6644
03:52:45,410 --> 03:52:46,330
One of them is cracked.

6645
03:52:48,030 --> 03:52:49,290
Yeah, we did it!

6646
03:52:55,330 --> 03:52:56,770
I'll play Wingman the entire game.

6647
03:52:57,170 --> 03:52:58,670
Wait, we should all play Wingman.

6648
03:52:59,570 --> 03:53:00,010
No.

6649
03:53:00,390 --> 03:53:01,130
Wait, why not?

6650
03:53:02,770 --> 03:53:03,450
Why not?

6651
03:53:03,710 --> 03:53:04,810
I have my Wingman.

6652
03:53:07,630 --> 03:53:08,630
I have a Wingman.

6653
03:53:08,850 --> 03:53:09,710
You should stick to spray weapons.

6654
03:53:10,310 --> 03:53:12,670
Yep, I hit all my shots today.

6655
03:53:13,990 --> 03:53:15,230
How many shots did you shoot?

6656
03:53:15,470 --> 03:53:16,370
I hit five!

6657
03:53:18,570 --> 03:53:20,190
How many shots did you shoot?

6658
03:53:20,510 --> 03:53:20,910
Five!

6659
03:53:21,390 --> 03:53:22,330
Five out of five!

6660
03:53:22,330 --> 03:53:24,050
Literally five out of five!

6661
03:53:25,170 --> 03:53:27,610
If you hit all your shots, why didn't you knock one?

6662
03:53:28,810 --> 03:53:29,830
I got them.

6663
03:53:29,870 --> 03:53:30,090
I cracked them.

6664
03:53:30,090 --> 03:53:30,950
Five shots on Wingman.

6665
03:53:30,970 --> 03:53:35,710
Because I hit five shots on three different people.

6666
03:53:35,750 --> 03:53:38,570
And that's why they were all low.

6667
03:53:42,210 --> 03:53:46,550
I hit five shots on three different people and it cracked all three.

6668
03:53:49,150 --> 03:53:50,350
That's how math works.

6669
03:53:50,590 --> 03:53:51,750
That's what you do, yeah.

6670
03:53:52,330 --> 03:53:53,130
That's how math works.

6671
03:53:53,150 --> 03:53:53,630
That's what you did.

6672
03:53:56,550 --> 03:53:57,270
Oh my god.

6673
03:53:57,410 --> 03:53:58,670
You sort of deserve that.

6674
03:53:58,970 --> 03:54:01,150
I just got routed by... there's nowhere.

6675
03:54:01,770 --> 03:54:03,090
You sort of deserve that.

6676
03:54:04,210 --> 03:54:05,070
Misty, are you okay?

6677
03:54:05,110 --> 03:54:06,590
I knew that I would run here.

6678
03:54:08,010 --> 03:54:08,790
That's the Dragoon.

6679
03:54:09,270 --> 03:54:09,990
He's here.

6680
03:54:11,310 --> 03:54:12,230
He's very specific.

6681
03:54:13,470 --> 03:54:15,850
That's the Dragoon here to defend me.

6682
03:54:16,850 --> 03:54:18,410
I saw it happen in my life.

6683
03:54:19,870 --> 03:54:21,390
He's here to defend me.

6684
03:54:21,450 --> 03:54:22,090
Thank you.

6685
03:54:23,230 --> 03:54:24,530
He knew I was right.

6686
03:54:25,450 --> 03:54:26,750
Okay, we should craft him.

6687
03:54:26,830 --> 03:54:28,330
Where's the nearest crafter?

6688
03:54:28,470 --> 03:54:29,230
Like all the way...

6689
03:54:29,790 --> 03:54:30,230
Turbine?

6690
03:54:30,330 --> 03:54:31,570
Okay, I'll take the...

6691
03:54:35,650 --> 03:54:37,730
Alright, I'm redeploying the Turbine.

6692
03:54:39,910 --> 03:54:43,430
How does it feel up here that you're going to be saved by me?

6693
03:54:44,550 --> 03:54:45,630
You're not going to save me.

6694
03:54:45,710 --> 03:54:47,090
If you res me, I'll jump over the map.

6695
03:54:48,570 --> 03:54:49,350
Oh my god.

6696
03:54:50,450 --> 03:54:52,170
What a team player.

6697
03:54:52,470 --> 03:54:53,130
I'll wait here.

6698
03:54:54,750 --> 03:54:56,370
Okay, so I'll craft and...

6699
03:54:56,370 --> 03:54:58,870
What if I craft and rest you at res?

6700
03:54:59,090 --> 03:55:00,250
Would you still jump off?

6701
03:55:00,490 --> 03:55:02,090
You'd jump off halfway.

6702
03:55:03,310 --> 03:55:05,490
No, you should just not wear armor.

6703
03:55:07,490 --> 03:55:08,970
You might as well be half dead.

6704
03:55:10,770 --> 03:55:12,110
I crafted the wrong thing.

6705
03:55:13,750 --> 03:55:14,890
As in your life.

6706
03:55:16,730 --> 03:55:18,050
I told you not to res me.

6707
03:55:19,170 --> 03:55:21,570
He wants someone that res'd you, not me.

6708
03:55:21,570 --> 03:55:21,750
Res me!

6709
03:55:23,110 --> 03:55:24,350
There's a team fight over here.

6710
03:55:26,190 --> 03:55:27,630
What did res'd you do to you?

6711
03:55:27,710 --> 03:55:28,650
He did nothing to you.

6712
03:55:31,090 --> 03:55:33,370
No, he definitely did nothing to me.

6713
03:55:35,070 --> 03:55:37,170
You're going to fight this, res'd you?

6714
03:55:37,350 --> 03:55:39,630
He's on your side by automatic default.

6715
03:55:39,750 --> 03:55:40,310
He's my enemy.

6716
03:55:41,410 --> 03:55:41,810
Whoa!

6717
03:55:42,910 --> 03:55:44,270
He's a neutral party.

6718
03:55:45,130 --> 03:55:46,870
Yeah, he has no bias.

6719
03:55:47,290 --> 03:55:48,570
It's like he's a judge.

6720
03:55:50,510 --> 03:55:52,130
Dude, not a balance at all.

6721
03:55:52,430 --> 03:55:53,550
Yes, he is.

6722
03:55:57,310 --> 03:55:58,370
Wait, to our right.

6723
03:55:58,510 --> 03:55:58,690
There's people behind me.

6724
03:56:01,770 --> 03:56:02,190
Flesh?

6725
03:56:03,050 --> 03:56:03,790
Oh my god.

6726
03:56:03,950 --> 03:56:08,350
You know when your teammates get shot by a different team, then you turn it on and you help them.

6727
03:56:08,350 --> 03:56:10,010
Then don't get shot by a different team.

6728
03:56:11,550 --> 03:56:13,150
I didn't res myself there.

6729
03:56:13,910 --> 03:56:16,610
Yeah, but now I have a different team on me.

6730
03:56:16,890 --> 03:56:18,430
Yeah, that's a great res.

6731
03:56:19,030 --> 03:56:20,110
It's my favorite res.

6732
03:56:20,130 --> 03:56:22,150
When my teammates res me and then they run away from me.

6733
03:56:22,190 --> 03:56:24,370
Now you're getting three men sent from this side.

6734
03:56:25,910 --> 03:56:27,950
Three people from this direction.

6735
03:56:28,130 --> 03:56:29,790
No, I got grappled!

6736
03:56:29,950 --> 03:56:31,570
I got grappled!

6737
03:56:31,910 --> 03:56:33,610
Alright, we gotta play another then.

6738
03:56:33,930 --> 03:56:34,630
You're right.

6739
03:56:36,250 --> 03:56:36,730
Why?

6740
03:56:37,130 --> 03:56:38,430
Oh my god.

6741
03:56:39,550 --> 03:56:41,930
Because RPI embarrassed himself on stream.

6742
03:56:41,990 --> 03:56:42,950
We gotta redeem him.

6743
03:56:43,610 --> 03:56:49,570
But can you guys at least res me and then stick with me instead of leave me alone to get chased by a different team?

6744
03:56:50,330 --> 03:56:52,290
That's not our fault you got chased.

6745
03:56:53,150 --> 03:56:54,470
Then don't res me!

6746
03:56:54,630 --> 03:56:55,470
Don't res me then!

6747
03:56:55,570 --> 03:56:56,690
I'd rather not be resed.

6748
03:56:56,690 --> 03:56:57,670
Then don't die!

6749
03:56:58,110 --> 03:56:59,970
Literally land in a safer spot.

6750
03:57:00,570 --> 03:57:02,890
I res and I look around.

6751
03:57:03,070 --> 03:57:04,330
Yeah, there's nobody there.

6752
03:57:05,030 --> 03:57:06,370
I hate this team.

6753
03:57:06,870 --> 03:57:07,910
Don't you don't.

6754
03:57:09,150 --> 03:57:11,490
If you hate this team, you would have left.

6755
03:57:11,550 --> 03:57:12,450
But you're still here.

6756
03:57:13,350 --> 03:57:14,650
Yeah, because I have shit to do.

6757
03:57:14,710 --> 03:57:16,870
I need a waiting room.

6758
03:57:16,870 --> 03:57:17,790
I need time to rest.

6759
03:57:17,870 --> 03:57:19,830
You need a waiting room?

6760
03:57:20,990 --> 03:57:24,790
Yeah, I got something in three hours I have to do on stream so I have to waste time.

6761
03:57:24,790 --> 03:57:25,910
But what are you doing in three hours?

6762
03:57:27,390 --> 03:57:29,110
You wouldn't understand if I hadn't told you.

6763
03:57:29,270 --> 03:57:30,410
What are you doing in three hours?

6764
03:57:30,610 --> 03:57:31,290
No, tell us.

6765
03:57:32,530 --> 03:57:34,370
My Discord has a tournament.

6766
03:57:34,770 --> 03:57:36,730
Oh shit, an Apex tournament?

6767
03:57:37,630 --> 03:57:38,450
Your Discord?

6768
03:57:39,230 --> 03:57:40,570
Wait, are they good?

6769
03:57:41,250 --> 03:57:42,450
Why don't you invite me?

6770
03:57:42,550 --> 03:57:42,570
No.

6771
03:57:43,710 --> 03:57:46,570
Why would I invite you to my viewers Discord tournament?

6772
03:57:47,450 --> 03:57:48,490
Yeah, why don't you invite us?

6773
03:57:48,490 --> 03:57:50,570
Why would you guys play my viewers tournament?

6774
03:57:50,570 --> 03:57:52,250
We could play as a team together.

6775
03:57:52,670 --> 03:57:54,110
And see if they can beat us.

6776
03:57:54,150 --> 03:57:56,370
No, I have to spectate them.

6777
03:57:56,430 --> 03:57:57,470
I'm not going to play against them.

6778
03:57:57,470 --> 03:58:01,410
Well, if they land on you just to kill you, then you can spectate.

6779
03:58:02,870 --> 03:58:03,310
True.

6780
03:58:07,490 --> 03:58:10,910
I'm supposed to cast the tournament, not kill them all.

6781
03:58:11,990 --> 03:58:13,590
Well, I love your viewers.

6782
03:58:13,590 --> 03:58:14,550
So you're trying to say...

6783
03:58:15,430 --> 03:58:18,570
I bet you a viewer in there is better than you.

6784
03:58:25,490 --> 03:58:27,210
She hasn't seen my viewers.

6785
03:58:28,090 --> 03:58:28,610
Wow!

6786
03:58:30,390 --> 03:58:31,390
You're scared.

6787
03:58:31,590 --> 03:58:32,690
You're scared of your viewers.

6788
03:58:33,050 --> 03:58:35,370
You're scared of losing to them.

6789
03:58:36,010 --> 03:58:37,710
I'm so scared of them.

6790
03:58:38,210 --> 03:58:40,110
Yeah, you're scared of losing to your viewers.

6791
03:58:41,110 --> 03:58:42,170
Yeah, you're right.

6792
03:58:42,570 --> 03:58:43,550
I'm so fucking scared.

6793
03:58:43,890 --> 03:58:47,050
If you're not scared, you would do a 1v1 tournament against your viewers.

6794
03:58:47,330 --> 03:58:51,410
You just want to play against viewers and stomp them so you feel better about yourself.

6795
03:58:51,530 --> 03:58:55,170
No, I just want you to do a 1v1 tournament against your viewers to see it.

6796
03:58:55,170 --> 03:58:56,430
We already have a 1v1 tournament.

6797
03:58:56,630 --> 03:58:58,430
But I never play against your viewers.

6798
03:58:58,470 --> 03:58:58,990
It's not fair.

6799
03:58:59,250 --> 03:58:59,730
What do you mean?

6800
03:59:01,170 --> 03:59:04,010
So you don't think they have a chance to beat you.

6801
03:59:05,410 --> 03:59:06,810
Of course they don't.

6802
03:59:06,810 --> 03:59:08,170
Are you crazy, Howard?

6803
03:59:08,310 --> 03:59:10,630
A bunch of plot players are going to beat me in competitive.

6804
03:59:12,050 --> 03:59:14,310
I have like, pred players that watch me.

6805
03:59:16,430 --> 03:59:18,710
Are you trying to say you don't have pred players that watch you?

6806
03:59:18,930 --> 03:59:19,710
Not your viewers.

6807
03:59:20,370 --> 03:59:21,370
They're my viewers.

6808
03:59:22,170 --> 03:59:24,250
No, you don't know about plot players, RPR.

6809
03:59:24,390 --> 03:59:25,390
They think they're the best.

6810
03:59:25,830 --> 03:59:27,170
Yeah, I mean, Rusty has plat.

6811
03:59:27,410 --> 03:59:29,150
Yeah, Rusty has plat.

6812
03:59:29,350 --> 03:59:30,490
He can literally beat you up.

6813
03:59:32,310 --> 03:59:35,050
Okay, but Rusty has plat because he doesn't play the game.

6814
03:59:36,830 --> 03:59:37,530
Yes, he does.

6815
03:59:37,610 --> 03:59:38,490
How did he get to plat?

6816
03:59:39,730 --> 03:59:43,190
If I look at his YouTube channel right now, it's like literally Apex.

6817
03:59:45,870 --> 03:59:49,570
It's like the majority of his YouTube channel is literally like Apex.

6818
03:59:49,730 --> 03:59:50,470
What do you mean?

6819
03:59:50,590 --> 03:59:53,490
Can I ask you, can you annoy fucking Rusty and not me?

6820
03:59:54,530 --> 03:59:55,130
For once.

6821
03:59:56,070 --> 03:59:56,790
What do you mean?

6822
03:59:57,630 --> 03:59:59,930
Oh my god, he threw everything at us.

6823
04:00:01,630 --> 04:00:02,550
No, no ammo.

6824
04:00:03,090 --> 04:00:04,030
Oh my god, I'm dead.

6825
04:00:04,170 --> 04:00:04,990
What the fuck, another team?

6826
04:00:08,490 --> 04:00:09,350
Oh my god, he's won.

6827
04:00:09,610 --> 04:00:11,010
Oh, goodbye, RPR.

6828
04:00:12,230 --> 04:00:13,610
You're so fucked.

6829
04:00:14,210 --> 04:00:15,550
Are you still alive?

6830
04:00:16,710 --> 04:00:18,170
How are you guys dead?

6831
04:00:18,670 --> 04:00:19,650
What do you mean?

6832
04:00:19,730 --> 04:00:20,590
We landed.

6833
04:00:21,030 --> 04:00:22,750
We were landing.

6834
04:00:24,590 --> 04:00:25,630
200 ping.

6835
04:00:25,650 --> 04:00:27,450
How the fuck am I gonna get a gun?

6836
04:00:27,790 --> 04:00:32,210
I have 250 and I did five times your damage.

6837
04:00:32,330 --> 04:00:34,710
Who let you beat Joe Vassi?

6838
04:00:34,810 --> 04:00:35,190
I don't have a gun.

6839
04:00:36,570 --> 04:00:38,330
Yeah, Rusty had no gun.

6840
04:00:38,490 --> 04:00:40,430
Keep giving me jump master.

6841
04:00:40,530 --> 04:00:41,590
We're gonna keep going right there.

6842
04:00:41,790 --> 04:00:43,190
We're gonna go right there.

6843
04:00:43,690 --> 04:00:45,210
Again and again and again.

6844
04:00:45,790 --> 04:00:46,890
Keep giving it to me.

6845
04:00:47,390 --> 04:00:48,370
Fine, we will.

6846
04:00:50,470 --> 04:00:50,910
Alright.

6847
04:00:51,290 --> 04:00:52,090
It's fine, it's fine.

6848
04:00:52,510 --> 04:00:53,790
Yeah, yeah, I'm not scared.

6849
04:00:55,450 --> 04:00:57,910
I'm not scared either, which is why I jumped here.

6850
04:01:00,430 --> 04:01:01,030
I'm not fucking scared.

6851
04:01:01,030 --> 04:01:03,550
I am not scared either, which is why I landed there.

6852
04:01:04,130 --> 04:01:04,570
Specifically.

6853
04:01:04,570 --> 04:01:04,890
Specifically.

6854
04:01:06,670 --> 04:01:08,110
I literally was a Horizon.

6855
04:01:08,330 --> 04:01:10,010
I can't pick up a gun.

6856
04:01:11,090 --> 04:01:13,950
Why are you playing Horizon on 200 ping though?

6857
04:01:15,050 --> 04:01:16,630
Horizon is good for 200 ping.

6858
04:01:17,270 --> 04:01:17,710
No!

6859
04:01:17,870 --> 04:01:20,150
When you press Q, you just lag mid-air.

6860
04:01:20,450 --> 04:01:21,550
Yeah, but then...

6861
04:01:21,550 --> 04:01:22,270
That's 250.

6862
04:01:22,530 --> 04:01:23,150
200 is fine.

6863
04:01:24,010 --> 04:01:24,450
Yeah.

6864
04:01:24,830 --> 04:01:25,930
This guy is on crack.

6865
04:01:26,370 --> 04:01:30,330
And if he's lagging in the air, that means it's harder to hit him for the other teammates.

6866
04:01:31,770 --> 04:01:32,210
True.

6867
04:01:32,210 --> 04:01:34,450
Yeah, see, if he can't hit anybody...

6868
04:01:34,450 --> 04:01:35,230
I can show you guys...

6869
04:01:35,770 --> 04:01:38,810
I can show you guys the clip of my viewer's skill level.

6870
04:01:41,270 --> 04:01:41,670
Damn.

6871
04:01:42,870 --> 04:01:43,870
Live on stream?

6872
04:01:44,030 --> 04:01:45,710
You have to show it on your own stream too.

6873
04:01:46,930 --> 04:01:47,570
Yeah, I mean...

6874
04:01:48,070 --> 04:01:50,150
We've been watching that clip for a while now.

6875
04:01:51,550 --> 04:01:52,870
It happened on stream.

6876
04:01:53,630 --> 04:01:54,770
Chat, someone give it to me.

6877
04:01:58,880 --> 04:02:00,020
Chat, I bet you...

6878
04:02:00,020 --> 04:02:00,940
This is one of the...

6879
04:02:00,940 --> 04:02:04,180
This clip is one of the higher ranked players.

6880
04:02:04,540 --> 04:02:05,880
Wait, how high is...

6881
04:02:05,880 --> 04:02:07,660
How high the rank is?

6882
04:02:08,580 --> 04:02:09,600
Like a diamond.

6883
04:02:11,500 --> 04:02:12,520
But like...

6884
04:02:12,520 --> 04:02:13,520
Which season?

6885
04:02:18,300 --> 04:02:18,940
Listen...

6886
04:02:18,940 --> 04:02:21,500
I bet my viewers can...

6887
04:02:21,500 --> 04:02:22,980
Can win against your viewers.

6888
04:02:26,000 --> 04:02:27,800
By process of elimination...

6889
04:02:27,800 --> 04:02:30,080
You have more viewers.

6890
04:02:31,020 --> 04:02:32,220
Numbers beat numbers.

6891
04:02:32,420 --> 04:02:32,780
What do you mean?

6892
04:02:32,860 --> 04:02:33,380
That's not true.

6893
04:02:36,000 --> 04:02:36,500
The average is out.

6894
04:02:37,640 --> 04:02:40,260
But even their average is higher than your average.

6895
04:02:40,800 --> 04:02:41,240
No.

6896
04:02:41,340 --> 04:02:42,080
Yes, it is.

6897
04:02:42,380 --> 04:02:44,460
You're literally an Apex streamer.

6898
04:02:44,480 --> 04:02:46,460
You should have more Apex viewers then.

6899
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:47,060
Shouldn't you?

6900
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:50,100
You're an Apex streamer too.

6901
04:02:50,900 --> 04:02:51,800
What do you mean?

6902
04:02:52,180 --> 04:02:55,560
The last Apex stream I did was like 2-3 weeks ago.

6903
04:02:56,680 --> 04:02:57,620
You came from Apex.

6904
04:02:57,620 --> 04:02:58,160
That's not so long ago.

6905
04:02:59,360 --> 04:03:01,780
I thought it was gonna be like 3 months ago.

6906
04:03:01,840 --> 04:03:02,380
Yeah, I know.

6907
04:03:03,060 --> 04:03:03,920
Maybe it was.

6908
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:04,440
I don't remember.

6909
04:03:04,940 --> 04:03:05,780
What was like last Apex?

6910
04:03:06,680 --> 04:03:08,000
There you go.

6911
04:03:08,780 --> 04:03:10,960
In general, I got the perfect clip.

6912
04:03:14,910 --> 04:03:15,850
Well, we're landing.

6913
04:03:16,050 --> 04:03:16,410
Oh hey!

6914
04:03:16,450 --> 04:03:17,230
Rusty has Jumpmaster.

6915
04:03:17,410 --> 04:03:18,210
So we're gonna live.

6916
04:03:20,350 --> 04:03:20,750
True.

6917
04:03:21,850 --> 04:03:22,250
True.

6918
04:03:23,130 --> 04:03:25,350
It's like dumb and dumber bro in that clip.

6919
04:03:26,970 --> 04:03:27,370
Wait,

6920
04:03:31,820 --> 04:03:33,120
is there anyone that landed with us?

6921
04:03:33,180 --> 04:03:33,920
Oh yeah, there is.

6922
04:03:33,920 --> 04:03:35,760
Yeah, two teams and I'm getting sent.

6923
04:03:38,480 --> 04:03:39,380
I need help.

6924
04:03:39,460 --> 04:03:40,340
We're heading over.

6925
04:03:40,640 --> 04:03:43,360
We're literally walking as fast as we could.

6926
04:03:43,680 --> 04:03:46,200
Well, I cracked three of them, but there's just three of them on me.

6927
04:03:48,100 --> 04:03:49,220
Oh, that's embarrassing.

6928
04:03:50,940 --> 04:03:52,160
Okay, Restia, I'm heading over.

6929
04:03:52,300 --> 04:03:52,680
Live.

6930
04:03:54,960 --> 04:03:57,540
What's embarrassing is that I'm probably still going to do more damage than you.

6931
04:03:57,700 --> 04:03:58,500
I'll show you that here.

6932
04:03:59,320 --> 04:03:59,720
What?

6933
04:04:02,640 --> 04:04:03,220
All right.

6934
04:04:03,220 --> 04:04:03,800
Yay!

6935
04:04:05,600 --> 04:04:06,400
Wow, good job, guys.

6936
04:04:06,740 --> 04:04:08,040
We did it!

6937
04:04:09,700 --> 04:04:10,640
Where's my vault?

6938
04:04:10,800 --> 04:04:11,340
Oh, there it is.

6939
04:04:11,520 --> 04:04:11,780
All right.

6940
04:04:12,540 --> 04:04:13,780
Wait, I want to grab my vault.

6941
04:04:15,660 --> 04:04:17,600
Oh, you only had a double sentinel.

6942
04:04:17,700 --> 04:04:18,160
That's fucked.

6943
04:04:20,380 --> 04:04:21,760
Wait, I want to run a sentinel.

6944
04:04:22,740 --> 04:04:25,120
Wait, I want to run a longbow.

6945
04:04:29,040 --> 04:04:29,760
Oh, nice.

6946
04:04:30,800 --> 04:04:32,340
All right, my turn to snipe.

6947
04:04:34,640 --> 04:04:36,560
Mom said it's my turn to snipe.

6948
04:04:36,940 --> 04:04:38,580
Holy shit, 300 ping.

6949
04:04:39,240 --> 04:04:40,700
How did you get to 300 ping?

6950
04:04:40,800 --> 04:04:41,900
I thought you had VPN on.

6951
04:04:43,200 --> 04:04:44,860
There's people shooting to my left.

6952
04:04:45,140 --> 04:04:48,320
Because Apex servers are perfect, and they never lag.

6953
04:04:48,420 --> 04:04:48,480
What do you mean?

6954
04:04:48,480 --> 04:04:49,400
Oh my god, there's no sentinel.

6955
04:04:50,180 --> 04:04:51,720
Yeah, I only found the longbow.

6956
04:04:53,020 --> 04:04:54,460
There's a sentinel I dropped in here.

6957
04:04:55,120 --> 04:04:56,640
Yeah, oh yeah, he has two sentinels.

6958
04:04:57,280 --> 04:04:58,520
Yeah, look at his box.

6959
04:04:58,920 --> 04:04:59,960
I only had one sentinel.

6960
04:05:01,520 --> 04:05:01,960
Really?

6961
04:05:02,080 --> 04:05:02,800
I saw you had two.

6962
04:05:03,020 --> 04:05:04,300
Unless they swapped with you.

6963
04:05:04,740 --> 04:05:05,720
For some reason.

6964
04:05:05,740 --> 04:05:06,120
No, I had one.

6965
04:05:07,660 --> 04:05:09,060
Oh, wait, I shouldn't have done that.

6966
04:05:09,440 --> 04:05:10,720
Where are we going, guys?

6967
04:05:12,720 --> 04:05:14,000
To the basement.

6968
04:05:14,760 --> 04:05:15,960
RGL, where do we go?

6969
04:05:18,960 --> 04:05:21,340
Wait, there are?

6970
04:05:22,140 --> 04:05:23,000
Oh, I see him.

6971
04:05:23,800 --> 04:05:24,460
He's running.

6972
04:05:25,020 --> 04:05:27,840
Nice, I also hit a shot too.

6973
04:05:28,740 --> 04:05:31,140
So it should be like, almost dead.

6974
04:05:33,540 --> 04:05:34,300
Where is he?

6975
04:05:36,740 --> 04:05:38,100
Oh, he grappled behind.

6976
04:05:38,140 --> 04:05:38,600
Oh, what the fuck?

6977
04:05:38,760 --> 04:05:39,560
What are you doing here?

6978
04:05:39,820 --> 04:05:40,540
He's dead.

6979
04:05:41,880 --> 04:05:43,520
What are you doing here?

6980
04:05:45,980 --> 04:05:46,460
Hello.

6981
04:05:47,420 --> 04:05:49,120
Oh my god, toxic, toxic.

6982
04:05:49,520 --> 04:05:50,760
You're so stupid.

6983
04:05:51,540 --> 04:05:52,820
Yeah, he's dead, we did it.

6984
04:05:52,960 --> 04:05:53,380
You alright?

6985
04:05:55,100 --> 04:05:55,860
Yeah, they're fine.

6986
04:06:00,360 --> 04:06:01,280
Where are they?

6987
04:06:02,480 --> 04:06:03,500
RGL, where are they?

6988
04:06:04,120 --> 04:06:05,140
They're like, far.

6989
04:06:05,400 --> 04:06:06,240
What do you want from me?

6990
04:06:06,280 --> 04:06:07,560
Do you not have eyes or ears?

6991
04:06:07,860 --> 04:06:10,220
My eyes don't work as well as yours.

6992
04:06:10,280 --> 04:06:12,800
Because you're a more professional gamer.

6993
04:06:13,180 --> 04:06:13,480
How?

6994
04:06:14,400 --> 04:06:16,900
Yeah, I wear glasses.

6995
04:06:16,900 --> 04:06:17,680
Into your Chinese mode.

6996
04:06:21,110 --> 04:06:23,790
It requires for other people to be nice, so I can be nice to them.

6997
04:06:23,830 --> 04:06:24,510
You guys are not nice.

6998
04:06:24,970 --> 04:06:25,710
I'm nice.

6999
04:06:27,870 --> 04:06:29,290
Wait, I can't reach that.

7000
04:06:29,370 --> 04:06:30,330
I can't reach that zip.

7001
04:06:31,830 --> 04:06:32,650
Go from the bottom.

7002
04:06:34,810 --> 04:06:36,110
Wait, the last guy is with me.

7003
04:06:38,890 --> 04:06:39,870
Wait, what the fuck?

7004
04:06:39,970 --> 04:06:42,470
Rave is so bad now, you can see where he is.

7005
04:06:44,690 --> 04:06:46,110
Just stepped on this motherfucker.

7006
04:06:46,510 --> 04:06:47,370
Wait, where did he go?

7007
04:06:48,010 --> 04:06:48,970
Oh, he's over here.

7008
04:06:49,590 --> 04:06:51,510
No, one's right here.

7009
04:06:53,570 --> 04:06:53,970
How?

7010
04:06:55,090 --> 04:06:55,750
He's Loba.

7011
04:06:56,790 --> 04:06:57,510
Guys, I missed.

7012
04:06:57,650 --> 04:06:58,270
Oh, I hit my shots.

7013
04:06:58,910 --> 04:06:59,550
He's one.

7014
04:06:59,610 --> 04:07:00,250
He's literally one.

7015
04:07:01,650 --> 04:07:03,130
He's got a Loba again.

7016
04:07:07,290 --> 04:07:10,530
Bro, he keeps doing these weak jumpings.

7017
04:07:11,110 --> 04:07:11,590
Okay.

7018
04:07:12,270 --> 04:07:13,370
He's hiding in the corner.

7019
04:07:13,650 --> 04:07:14,570
Oh my god.

7020
04:07:17,210 --> 04:07:17,690
Please.

7021
04:07:18,170 --> 04:07:19,110
Stop running.

7022
04:07:19,430 --> 04:07:20,890
You're just gonna die.

7023
04:07:21,790 --> 04:07:23,810
She's gonna run into a different team and die.

7024
04:07:24,110 --> 04:07:24,790
That's true.

7025
04:07:24,930 --> 04:07:26,750
Didn't that team rez over there in front of us?

7026
04:07:26,750 --> 04:07:27,950
Yep.

7027
04:07:28,540 --> 04:07:29,410
Still alive.

7028
04:07:30,050 --> 04:07:32,550
Wait, where did she go?

7029
04:07:34,010 --> 04:07:35,390
You're never gonna catch her.

7030
04:07:35,430 --> 04:07:35,730
She's gone.

7031
04:07:35,930 --> 04:07:37,250
She disappeared.

7032
04:07:37,870 --> 04:07:39,550
She probably braceleted again.

7033
04:07:40,330 --> 04:07:41,790
Oh, shots here.

7034
04:07:43,990 --> 04:07:44,690
Wait.

7035
04:07:45,610 --> 04:07:47,230
Oh, on me.

7036
04:07:48,510 --> 04:07:50,270
He fucking domed in me.

7037
04:07:50,750 --> 04:07:52,210
We killed this motherfucker.

7038
04:07:52,710 --> 04:07:53,590
Yeah, kill him.

7039
04:07:53,950 --> 04:07:54,970
He's phoenixing.

7040
04:07:56,750 --> 04:07:57,130
What did he...

7041
04:07:57,570 --> 04:07:57,970
Oh.

7042
04:08:01,510 --> 04:08:02,230
Wait, where...

7043
04:08:02,710 --> 04:08:03,610
Where's his teammate?

7044
04:08:04,030 --> 04:08:05,010
He shot from above.

7045
04:08:05,310 --> 04:08:06,910
Alright, he was great in the video game.

7046
04:08:09,890 --> 04:08:10,350
On me?

7047
04:08:10,350 --> 04:08:10,970
He's finishing me.

7048
04:08:10,970 --> 04:08:12,170
Just fucking kill the guy.

7049
04:08:14,070 --> 04:08:15,010
Oh, we're looking at this.

7050
04:08:15,070 --> 04:08:15,810
Can you thirst him for me?

7051
04:08:16,310 --> 04:08:16,990
Cue me up.

7052
04:08:17,010 --> 04:08:17,470
Cue me up.

7053
04:08:17,710 --> 04:08:18,990
10 seconds.

7054
04:08:19,090 --> 04:08:19,470
10 seconds.

7055
04:08:20,290 --> 04:08:21,170
What the fuck?

7056
04:08:23,170 --> 04:08:23,950
Where's an Ashe?

7057
04:08:26,750 --> 04:08:27,770
I'm a team player.

7058
04:08:28,190 --> 04:08:29,610
On top of... on here?

7059
04:08:30,510 --> 04:08:30,990
Where?

7060
04:08:31,290 --> 04:08:33,030
Oh, he is here.

7061
04:08:35,350 --> 04:08:35,830
79?

7062
04:08:37,050 --> 04:08:37,690
I'm missing?

7063
04:08:38,110 --> 04:08:40,090
Because of the... because of the zone?

7064
04:08:40,250 --> 04:08:40,570
That's why?

7065
04:08:41,190 --> 04:08:43,830
Yeah, his teammates are...

7066
04:08:43,830 --> 04:08:45,430
His teammates are in front of me.

7067
04:08:45,510 --> 04:08:46,230
Oh, I hit that though.

7068
04:08:51,040 --> 04:08:52,040
I need to heal.

7069
04:08:53,660 --> 04:08:55,400
You guys don't understand the knockback.

7070
04:08:57,560 --> 04:08:59,080
The knockback hurts guys.

7071
04:08:59,300 --> 04:08:59,360
You know what's annoying?

7072
04:08:59,820 --> 04:09:06,720
Is that you use... you can use a heat shield in zone and you still fucking aim punch while heat shielding in zone.

7073
04:09:06,860 --> 04:09:07,080
Wait, really?

7074
04:09:08,100 --> 04:09:09,560
I didn't know that.

7075
04:09:11,240 --> 04:09:12,280
That's fucking bad.

7076
04:09:13,300 --> 04:09:14,420
That's fucking weird.

7077
04:09:15,140 --> 04:09:15,660
Alright.

7078
04:09:15,820 --> 04:09:17,640
I have to heal.

7079
04:09:17,860 --> 04:09:19,160
The Magi we just killed.

7080
04:09:22,650 --> 04:09:23,670
I'm running.

7081
04:09:23,710 --> 04:09:25,490
I'm running as fast as I can.

7082
04:09:27,050 --> 04:09:28,030
You got a med kit?

7083
04:09:28,450 --> 04:09:29,050
I do.

7084
04:09:29,190 --> 04:09:29,490
Here.

7085
04:09:30,430 --> 04:09:31,110
Thank you.

7086
04:09:33,410 --> 04:09:35,150
Maybe they know we are heading over.

7087
04:09:37,650 --> 04:09:39,130
No, because there is a fight in front of us.

7088
04:09:39,230 --> 04:09:39,310
Yeah.

7089
04:09:43,630 --> 04:09:44,030
Alright.

7090
04:09:44,550 --> 04:09:45,350
I'm syringing.

7091
04:09:46,390 --> 04:09:47,490
I'm doing my job.

7092
04:09:48,650 --> 04:09:49,050
Horizon?

7093
04:09:49,970 --> 04:09:51,130
Wait, did we thirst that?

7094
04:09:51,170 --> 04:09:51,910
Fucking tractor?

7095
04:09:52,430 --> 04:09:53,130
Yeah, we did.

7096
04:09:53,130 --> 04:09:53,590
Okay.

7097
04:09:55,410 --> 04:09:57,910
A guy with me no audio again, bro.

7098
04:09:58,050 --> 04:09:58,710
This is insane.

7099
04:09:59,230 --> 04:10:00,410
I got him.

7100
04:10:00,410 --> 04:10:01,110
I'm rezzing.

7101
04:10:02,670 --> 04:10:03,870
Fucking hate this game.

7102
04:10:04,430 --> 04:10:05,290
Wait, I...

7103
04:10:07,790 --> 04:10:09,690
It's Ash with no fucking audio again, dude.

7104
04:10:10,550 --> 04:10:11,470
I heard him.

7105
04:10:11,530 --> 04:10:12,630
That's why I stopped the rezz.

7106
04:10:13,670 --> 04:10:14,530
What do you mean?

7107
04:10:14,610 --> 04:10:15,330
I heard him.

7108
04:10:18,110 --> 04:10:19,250
I had the ears.

7109
04:10:19,310 --> 04:10:21,010
Why does Horizon have no fucking audio?

7110
04:10:21,330 --> 04:10:22,710
Yeah, I did.

7111
04:10:23,730 --> 04:10:25,290
That guy just was next to me.

7112
04:10:25,350 --> 04:10:25,750
I was like, huh?

7113
04:10:27,670 --> 04:10:29,090
What the fuck was that?

7114
04:10:30,350 --> 04:10:31,050
I don't know.

7115
04:10:31,090 --> 04:10:32,270
But that wasn't Metal Legs.

7116
04:10:32,270 --> 04:10:33,450
He doesn't have Metal Legs.

7117
04:10:34,470 --> 04:10:39,290
Yeah, but there is an overall inability to hear footsteps in this game.

7118
04:10:40,230 --> 04:10:42,950
That is not related to Metal Legs.

7119
04:10:44,290 --> 04:10:45,330
I need like...

7120
04:10:45,330 --> 04:10:47,370
I have zero attachments on my vault.

7121
04:10:47,630 --> 04:10:48,730
I didn't even notice that.

7122
04:10:51,370 --> 04:10:52,190
A 2x.

7123
04:10:52,190 --> 04:10:53,850
I'm going to zone from here.

7124
04:10:53,890 --> 04:10:54,490
I see people here.

7125
04:10:55,150 --> 04:10:55,930
From where?

7126
04:10:55,970 --> 04:10:56,650
There, okay.

7127
04:11:01,700 --> 04:11:03,540
I'm here, panning over.

7128
04:11:04,580 --> 04:11:06,220
We gotta walk over.

7129
04:11:06,340 --> 04:11:07,900
Well, Brescia is taking the zip.

7130
04:11:08,040 --> 04:11:08,560
I'm walking.

7131
04:11:10,020 --> 04:11:10,860
Good idea.

7132
04:11:12,200 --> 04:11:13,140
Crack the pathfinder.

7133
04:11:13,540 --> 04:11:16,300
Was it a good idea for us to walk to them?

7134
04:11:19,360 --> 04:11:20,900
I don't have an angle.

7135
04:11:21,220 --> 04:11:21,600
I don't have an angle.

7136
04:11:21,600 --> 04:11:22,720
One of them is blue armor.

7137
04:11:24,140 --> 04:11:24,440
Smoke them.

7138
04:11:25,120 --> 04:11:26,260
I want to shoot them.

7139
04:11:27,520 --> 04:11:30,220
Yeah, but they're going to do more damage to us than we will to them.

7140
04:11:30,960 --> 04:11:31,900
Oh, you're right.

7141
04:11:32,400 --> 04:11:33,260
There's a squad right here.

7142
04:11:35,100 --> 04:11:36,380
Brescia, stop focusing on them.

7143
04:11:36,420 --> 04:11:37,820
Focus on the guys that are ganking us.

7144
04:11:38,020 --> 04:11:39,700
I didn't focus on them.

7145
04:11:39,800 --> 04:11:40,080
I'm coming.

7146
04:11:42,000 --> 04:11:42,480
He's one.

7147
04:11:42,540 --> 04:11:43,140
He's literally one.

7148
04:11:43,740 --> 04:11:44,120
What?

7149
04:11:45,160 --> 04:11:47,180
How did I lose that much HP?

7150
04:11:50,720 --> 04:11:51,900
I need your knockdown.

7151
04:11:52,140 --> 04:11:52,640
I'm pushing.

7152
04:11:52,800 --> 04:11:53,420
I'm putting it up.

7153
04:11:54,140 --> 04:11:54,660
I'm reloading.

7154
04:11:55,520 --> 04:11:56,660
I believe in Brescia.

7155
04:11:57,600 --> 04:11:58,560
I believed in him.

7156
04:11:58,600 --> 04:11:59,000
I knew it.

7157
04:11:59,040 --> 04:11:59,940
I'm just going to rez.

7158
04:12:01,780 --> 04:12:03,400
Why are you on the other side of the shield?

7159
04:12:03,460 --> 04:12:05,320
I don't fucking know.

7160
04:12:05,500 --> 04:12:07,500
Even I want to know why I'm over here too.

7161
04:12:11,220 --> 04:12:12,480
I was wondering too.

7162
04:12:13,240 --> 04:12:14,240
What is our raid portal?

7163
04:12:14,380 --> 04:12:15,140
Oh, he's portaling them.

7164
04:12:15,200 --> 04:12:17,340
We should push the portal before the other team comes.

7165
04:12:18,260 --> 04:12:18,680
They're dead.

7166
04:12:18,780 --> 04:12:19,700
Now look at the other team.

7167
04:12:19,880 --> 04:12:22,180
I'm ulting, so they'll have to run into my house.

7168
04:12:22,180 --> 04:12:22,760
Two of us with portal.

7169
04:12:23,600 --> 04:12:24,480
I'm medkidding.

7170
04:12:25,260 --> 04:12:28,160
They have to run through my ult too.

7171
04:12:29,660 --> 04:12:30,500
I'm medkidding.

7172
04:12:30,560 --> 04:12:31,960
They're going back for some reason.

7173
04:12:32,080 --> 04:12:32,460
They're taking it.

7174
04:12:32,600 --> 04:12:33,580
They are?

7175
04:12:35,640 --> 04:12:36,700
Left side, Maggy.

7176
04:12:38,860 --> 04:12:39,780
Maggy, 45, blue.

7177
04:12:41,420 --> 04:12:42,720
One in the zone in front of me.

7178
04:12:43,720 --> 04:12:45,660
What the fuck are all these?

7179
04:12:46,400 --> 04:12:47,720
I'm getting hit by everything.

7180
04:12:50,480 --> 04:12:52,000
I'm coming over.

7181
04:12:52,000 --> 04:12:52,240
I'm healing.

7182
04:12:52,480 --> 04:12:52,920
Nice.

7183
04:12:55,240 --> 04:12:56,320
I don't know where the last guy is.

7184
04:12:57,080 --> 04:12:58,940
I need the blue shields.

7185
04:13:00,140 --> 04:13:01,920
I can't finish her in what?

7186
04:13:03,020 --> 04:13:03,840
Where are they?

7187
04:13:04,580 --> 04:13:05,680
Oh, in front of us.

7188
04:13:05,800 --> 04:13:05,940
What?

7189
04:13:08,380 --> 04:13:10,040
No, that's a different team.

7190
04:13:10,100 --> 04:13:10,800
That's a different team.

7191
04:13:11,000 --> 04:13:12,160
That's a different team.

7192
04:13:13,520 --> 04:13:14,400
I am...

7193
04:13:15,060 --> 04:13:16,280
I need a heal.

7194
04:13:17,220 --> 04:13:17,880
Oh, guy.

7195
04:13:18,020 --> 04:13:18,360
Okay.

7196
04:13:22,000 --> 04:13:22,300
Oh my god.

7197
04:13:23,840 --> 04:13:25,020
I'm going to take this.

7198
04:13:25,040 --> 04:13:27,000
I'm going to open this bin right now.

7199
04:13:27,860 --> 04:13:30,200
And get a heal too in this.

7200
04:13:33,280 --> 04:13:33,720
Yay.

7201
04:13:38,360 --> 04:13:39,100
What's in it?

7202
04:13:41,000 --> 04:13:41,580
Oh, hey.

7203
04:13:41,620 --> 04:13:42,460
There's a glow of dawn buff.

7204
04:13:42,720 --> 04:13:43,100
Oh, hey.

7205
04:13:43,200 --> 04:13:44,000
It's an R9.

7206
04:13:49,120 --> 04:13:50,020
Hold the wingman.

7207
04:13:50,020 --> 04:13:50,620
What's the point?

7208
04:13:51,840 --> 04:13:53,400
Do I not have to ring this?

7209
04:13:54,780 --> 04:13:55,840
You guys have syringes?

7210
04:13:56,980 --> 04:13:57,500
Oh, yeah.

7211
04:13:57,800 --> 04:14:00,060
I dropped two medkits here as well.

7212
04:14:00,200 --> 04:14:00,880
Just pop medkit.

7213
04:14:01,080 --> 04:14:01,460
Okay.

7214
04:14:01,500 --> 04:14:02,900
I have medkit, but I just...

7215
04:14:03,880 --> 04:14:04,740
Oh, hey.

7216
04:14:04,820 --> 04:14:05,480
There's a glow helmet.

7217
04:14:06,300 --> 04:14:07,580
They're zipping to the left here.

7218
04:14:07,620 --> 04:14:07,980
Let's go here.

7219
04:14:09,020 --> 04:14:09,420
Okay.

7220
04:14:10,920 --> 04:14:12,120
I have the medkit.

7221
04:14:12,260 --> 04:14:12,800
Here I am.

7222
04:14:14,700 --> 04:14:15,660
I'm heading over.

7223
04:14:16,020 --> 04:14:17,480
They're fighting or some shit in front of me.

7224
04:14:20,280 --> 04:14:20,680
Whoa.

7225
04:14:20,860 --> 04:14:21,640
In front of me.

7226
04:14:21,640 --> 04:14:22,240
Fighting like crazy.

7227
04:14:22,660 --> 04:14:23,020
Yeah.

7228
04:14:23,140 --> 04:14:24,680
I saw the stray shots that...

7229
04:14:24,680 --> 04:14:26,240
Go from the left side so we're in zone.

7230
04:14:27,840 --> 04:14:28,200
Wait.

7231
04:14:28,240 --> 04:14:29,260
I wanna poke them though.

7232
04:14:29,700 --> 04:14:30,060
Really?

7233
04:14:30,060 --> 04:14:30,740
I'mma poke them.

7234
04:14:33,240 --> 04:14:33,720
Knocked one.

7235
04:14:36,500 --> 04:14:37,520
Don't commit to that side.

7236
04:14:41,460 --> 04:14:42,000
Oh my god.

7237
04:14:42,020 --> 04:14:42,600
He's so low.

7238
04:14:45,360 --> 04:14:46,180
The Pathfinder's one.

7239
04:14:46,780 --> 04:14:47,740
In a corner cracked.

7240
04:14:47,920 --> 04:14:48,540
One's below here.

7241
04:14:49,100 --> 04:14:49,620
Yeah, yeah.

7242
04:14:49,700 --> 04:14:50,460
But he has to be in zone.

7243
04:14:50,520 --> 04:14:51,200
He's lifeline raising.

7244
04:14:51,580 --> 04:14:52,220
I got him.

7245
04:14:53,120 --> 04:14:53,960
Pathfinder's heading to you.

7246
04:14:54,060 --> 04:14:54,740
Pathfinder's heading to you.

7247
04:14:57,240 --> 04:14:58,080
Pathfinder one dead.

7248
04:14:58,260 --> 04:14:58,700
Yay!

7249
04:14:59,840 --> 04:15:00,280
Alright.

7250
04:15:01,160 --> 04:15:02,040
He's literally in this corner.

7251
04:15:02,740 --> 04:15:03,180
Alright.

7252
04:15:03,240 --> 04:15:04,160
I believe in you, Rustia.

7253
04:15:07,760 --> 04:15:08,200
Whoa.

7254
04:15:08,320 --> 04:15:09,800
That guy's living for so long.

7255
04:15:10,620 --> 04:15:11,060
Yay!

7256
04:15:13,700 --> 04:15:14,520
Holy shit.

7257
04:15:14,540 --> 04:15:16,180
He lived for so long in that corner.

7258
04:15:16,300 --> 04:15:17,240
He was behind.

7259
04:15:18,280 --> 04:15:19,380
I was gonna say.

7260
04:15:19,560 --> 04:15:21,200
Why did that take a while?

7261
04:15:24,500 --> 04:15:25,240
That's crazy.

7262
04:15:25,520 --> 04:15:26,580
That's crazy.

7263
04:15:27,040 --> 04:15:28,000
Oh shit.

7264
04:15:28,280 --> 04:15:29,200
Oh no.

7265
04:15:29,300 --> 04:15:29,740
Oh no.

7266
04:15:31,380 --> 04:15:31,980
I'm fighting.

7267
04:15:36,080 --> 04:15:37,180
It's a bad fight.

7268
04:15:37,480 --> 04:15:38,320
It's a bad fight.

7269
04:15:38,640 --> 04:15:39,300
We can, right?

7270
04:15:40,540 --> 04:15:41,300
I think so.

7271
04:15:41,440 --> 04:15:41,800
Yeah.

7272
04:15:42,360 --> 04:15:44,500
Wait, wait.

7273
04:15:44,600 --> 04:15:44,820
I can't.

7274
04:15:44,860 --> 04:15:45,140
I'm healing.

7275
04:15:47,300 --> 04:15:48,120
I'm coming now.

7276
04:15:49,860 --> 04:15:51,760
There's heat shields around us, by the way.

7277
04:15:52,280 --> 04:15:54,220
We might die because of this.

7278
04:15:54,220 --> 04:15:54,280
No, no.

7279
04:15:54,280 --> 04:15:54,880
You won't die.

7280
04:15:54,940 --> 04:15:55,120
You're down.

7281
04:15:56,080 --> 04:15:56,440
Nope.

7282
04:15:56,720 --> 04:15:57,600
I need a med kit.

7283
04:15:57,740 --> 04:15:58,080
I need a med kit.

7284
04:15:58,600 --> 04:15:59,760
I need it here too.

7285
04:16:02,320 --> 04:16:02,960
I dropped one.

7286
04:16:03,600 --> 04:16:04,760
I'm med-kitting right now.

7287
04:16:06,700 --> 04:16:08,940
I didn't get a chance to grab another Mose down.

7288
04:16:09,020 --> 04:16:09,300
How does he see me?

7289
04:16:09,440 --> 04:16:11,160
How the fuck did he see me then?

7290
04:16:13,060 --> 04:16:14,140
Um, how do we get across?

7291
04:16:14,160 --> 04:16:14,420
We need to kill these guys.

7292
04:16:14,500 --> 04:16:15,100
We have an option.

7293
04:16:15,920 --> 04:16:17,040
Just go with my...

7294
04:16:17,040 --> 04:16:17,480
Oh.

7295
04:16:19,660 --> 04:16:21,160
Wait, come with me here.

7296
04:16:21,260 --> 04:16:21,760
We can take the zip.

7297
04:16:21,860 --> 04:16:22,000
Okay.

7298
04:16:22,200 --> 04:16:23,320
We gotta go down here.

7299
04:16:24,600 --> 04:16:25,920
They all shot me though.

7300
04:16:29,160 --> 04:16:29,880
I need a bat.

7301
04:16:32,160 --> 04:16:32,620
Rest here.

7302
04:16:32,700 --> 04:16:33,100
We're here already.

7303
04:16:33,720 --> 04:16:34,220
Yeah, I know.

7304
04:16:37,260 --> 04:16:38,280
Get ahead of this idiots.

7305
04:16:39,760 --> 04:16:40,460
Team over here.

7306
04:16:40,520 --> 04:16:41,240
Team in front of us.

7307
04:16:42,060 --> 04:16:42,920
I'm going here.

7308
04:16:42,980 --> 04:16:43,620
I'm getting ahead of them.

7309
04:16:43,700 --> 04:16:44,740
I'm getting ahead of all of this shit.

7310
04:16:45,800 --> 04:16:46,640
I smoked it.

7311
04:16:46,640 --> 04:16:47,020
I smoked it.

7312
04:16:47,040 --> 04:16:47,180
I smoked it.

7313
04:16:49,640 --> 04:16:51,100
I have ult too.

7314
04:16:55,480 --> 04:16:58,300
Can they fuck off with the fucking snipers, man?

7315
04:16:58,420 --> 04:17:00,760
I need like another Mose down.

7316
04:17:01,340 --> 04:17:02,560
Oh hey, nice med-kit.

7317
04:17:02,760 --> 04:17:03,320
That's what I needed.

7318
04:17:04,380 --> 04:17:04,820
No!

7319
04:17:07,140 --> 04:17:08,880
That guy with the bow needs to die.

7320
04:17:09,360 --> 04:17:10,820
Yeah, I'm fucking med-kitting.

7321
04:17:11,040 --> 04:17:11,900
I'm batting right now.

7322
04:17:12,360 --> 04:17:13,200
He's 1 HP.

7323
04:17:13,380 --> 04:17:14,040
He's literally 1.

7324
04:17:14,460 --> 04:17:14,900
Where?

7325
04:17:15,120 --> 04:17:16,000
I got a Phoenix.

7326
04:17:17,040 --> 04:17:18,820
I have no long range by the way.

7327
04:17:22,080 --> 04:17:22,820
He's over there.

7328
04:17:23,000 --> 04:17:23,960
What the hell?

7329
04:17:25,320 --> 04:17:26,280
Where's the other team?

7330
04:17:28,220 --> 04:17:29,080
Right side somewhere.

7331
04:17:29,760 --> 04:17:31,760
This guy is getting a left angle on us.

7332
04:17:31,840 --> 04:17:32,860
We should just fucking... I ult.

7333
04:17:32,980 --> 04:17:33,500
We should just push him.

7334
04:17:33,760 --> 04:17:34,780
Go there, Doki.

7335
04:17:34,880 --> 04:17:35,120
Go there.

7336
04:17:35,200 --> 04:17:35,680
Ult him.

7337
04:17:35,800 --> 04:17:36,580
I'm ulting it.

7338
04:17:38,140 --> 04:17:38,840
They're all there.

7339
04:17:38,920 --> 04:17:39,580
There's two of them now.

7340
04:17:39,620 --> 04:17:40,680
Yeah, I ulted.

7341
04:17:40,840 --> 04:17:42,600
The other team pushed them so we don't push now.

7342
04:17:43,880 --> 04:17:45,060
The other team took their height.

7343
04:17:45,060 --> 04:17:46,880
Yeah, but I can... I'm going to go from here.

7344
04:17:46,920 --> 04:17:47,340
This side.

7345
04:17:48,740 --> 04:17:49,100
40?

7346
04:17:52,760 --> 04:17:53,120
Flash?

7347
04:17:53,600 --> 04:17:54,440
Pathfinder's flashed.

7348
04:17:55,680 --> 04:17:56,180
He's down.

7349
04:17:56,240 --> 04:17:56,560
He's knocked.

7350
04:17:56,600 --> 04:17:57,340
He's not pushing up.

7351
04:17:57,780 --> 04:17:58,980
Why am I getting...

7352
04:18:01,240 --> 04:18:01,900
One team dead.

7353
04:18:02,000 --> 04:18:02,300
One team dead.

7354
04:18:03,700 --> 04:18:04,840
I'm going to ult on Doki.

7355
04:18:05,660 --> 04:18:06,020
Okay.

7356
04:18:07,280 --> 04:18:08,300
I got stunned.

7357
04:18:09,280 --> 04:18:10,440
I couldn't ult on you.

7358
04:18:10,960 --> 04:18:12,720
I'm right here.

7359
04:18:13,840 --> 04:18:14,500
Wait on me.

7360
04:18:14,600 --> 04:18:14,860
Oh shit.

7361
04:18:15,060 --> 04:18:15,460
They're hard.

7362
04:18:15,580 --> 04:18:15,940
Yeah, yeah.

7363
04:18:15,980 --> 04:18:16,240
You're fine.

7364
04:18:16,320 --> 04:18:17,000
Yeah, I'm batting.

7365
04:18:18,780 --> 04:18:19,380
They're pushing.

7366
04:18:19,420 --> 04:18:19,900
They're pushing hard.

7367
04:18:20,020 --> 04:18:20,340
They're pushing hard.

7368
04:18:20,720 --> 04:18:21,040
Yeah.

7369
04:18:24,180 --> 04:18:24,920
I'm looking for you.

7370
04:18:26,560 --> 04:18:27,100
I'm batting.

7371
04:18:28,040 --> 04:18:29,280
I almost cracked another.

7372
04:18:30,300 --> 04:18:30,960
What's my ult?

7373
04:18:31,620 --> 04:18:32,120
Ult him?

7374
04:18:33,100 --> 04:18:33,700
Wait on me.

7375
04:18:33,840 --> 04:18:34,260
On me.

7376
04:18:34,280 --> 04:18:34,420
On me.

7377
04:18:34,420 --> 04:18:34,580
On me.

7378
04:18:34,940 --> 04:18:35,400
This side.

7379
04:18:38,360 --> 04:18:38,820
Bang one.

7380
04:18:38,900 --> 04:18:39,140
Bang one.

7381
04:18:39,400 --> 04:18:39,720
Dead.

7382
04:18:42,060 --> 04:18:42,380
Stop.

7383
04:18:42,600 --> 04:18:43,700
I got the other.

7384
04:18:43,780 --> 04:18:43,920
Yeah.

7385
04:18:44,060 --> 04:18:44,480
Let's go.

7386
04:18:45,680 --> 04:18:46,700
Yeah, let's go.

7387
04:18:46,820 --> 04:18:47,400
I did nothing.

7388
04:18:48,940 --> 04:18:50,240
Look at us go.

7389
04:18:51,540 --> 04:18:53,060
You were serious though, weren't you?

7390
04:18:53,100 --> 04:18:53,840
Yeah, we were serious.

7391
04:18:53,880 --> 04:18:55,220
Look at us locked in.

7392
04:18:59,160 --> 04:19:01,080
He was serious though, so it's all that matters.

7393
04:19:01,320 --> 04:19:01,800
Yeah.

7394
04:19:02,660 --> 04:19:05,760
See, we're such a good team when we focus.

7395
04:19:07,560 --> 04:19:11,880
It's almost like we're good when you're just not fucking yapping and complaining all the time.

7396
04:19:11,880 --> 04:19:12,300
Yeah.

7397
04:19:12,380 --> 04:19:13,320
Look at us.

7398
04:19:14,240 --> 04:19:15,320
Holy shit.

7399
04:19:15,540 --> 04:19:16,220
What?

7400
04:19:16,580 --> 04:19:19,940
Someone just gifted 10 and Twitch gifted 18.

7401
04:19:20,700 --> 04:19:21,040
Whoa.

7402
04:19:21,260 --> 04:19:22,320
Oh my god.

7403
04:19:22,560 --> 04:19:23,420
What a good LG.

7404
04:19:24,080 --> 04:19:26,600
Look at that.

7405
04:19:26,600 --> 04:19:26,980
See?

7406
04:19:27,080 --> 04:19:27,720
What the fuck is that?

7407
04:19:28,120 --> 04:19:29,540
You won the lottery.

7408
04:19:31,060 --> 04:19:32,080
Fucking gotcha.

7409
04:19:32,480 --> 04:19:34,840
I freaking love gotcha, dude.

7410
04:19:35,740 --> 04:19:36,420
Alright.

7411
04:19:36,520 --> 04:19:37,540
GG's guys.

7412
04:19:38,060 --> 04:19:38,860
That was fun.

7413
04:19:38,920 --> 04:19:39,620
Are you done?

7414
04:19:39,860 --> 04:19:40,600
Yeah, I'm done.

7415
04:19:40,600 --> 04:19:41,500
Ristia, are you done too?

7416
04:19:41,940 --> 04:19:42,840
I can play.

7417
04:19:43,000 --> 04:19:44,880
I gotta go.

7418
04:19:46,780 --> 04:19:48,280
It's been four hours, guys.

7419
04:19:48,380 --> 04:19:48,980
I gotta go.

7420
04:19:49,860 --> 04:19:51,120
It's almost 4 in the morning.

7421
04:19:51,980 --> 04:19:54,500
No, it's like 3.30 a.m.

7422
04:19:54,500 --> 04:19:54,960
right now.

7423
04:19:55,460 --> 04:19:56,360
Fuck, I don't know.

7424
04:19:57,560 --> 04:19:58,180
GG's, guys.

7425
04:19:58,500 --> 04:19:59,260
That was fun.

7426
04:20:00,460 --> 04:20:02,580
I'm playing with you again, Ristia.

7427
04:20:03,320 --> 04:20:03,800
Yeah.

7428
04:20:04,240 --> 04:20:05,060
Definitely done.

7429
04:20:05,320 --> 04:20:05,860
Yeah, yeah.

7430
04:20:05,940 --> 04:20:06,660
Gotta do this again.

7431
04:20:08,180 --> 04:20:09,100
GG's, everybody.

7432
04:20:09,240 --> 04:20:10,580
I'm gonna go talk to my chat.

7433
04:20:11,640 --> 04:20:13,380
GG's, good luck with the rest of Diamond Games.

7434
04:20:13,640 --> 04:20:14,280
Good luck, Ristia.

7435
04:20:16,960 --> 04:20:18,360
He's gonna be in my team.

7436
04:20:18,480 --> 04:20:19,480
He's gonna be in my team.

7437
04:20:19,920 --> 04:20:22,180
You gotta say good luck to me too.

7438
04:20:22,240 --> 04:20:23,220
Otherwise, you're gonna lose.

7439
04:20:23,980 --> 04:20:24,720
No, that's fine.

7440
04:20:25,020 --> 04:20:26,380
Anyway, good luck to you, Ristia.

7441
04:20:26,460 --> 04:20:27,240
I believe in you.

7442
04:20:27,900 --> 04:20:28,940
Alright, bye, RPR.

7443
04:20:40,040 --> 04:20:41,320
That was fun, though.

7444
04:20:42,940 --> 04:20:47,440
I had a great time, chat.

7445
04:20:47,640 --> 04:20:50,160
It was great playing some Apex again.

7446
04:20:50,200 --> 04:20:50,840
We're almost gold.

7447
04:20:53,140 --> 04:20:54,180
We're almost...

7448
04:20:55,560 --> 04:20:58,020
We're almost gold, guys.

7449
04:20:58,280 --> 04:20:59,400
I mean, that's pretty good.

7450
04:20:59,720 --> 04:21:00,740
And I locked in.

7451
04:21:00,860 --> 04:21:02,360
We locked in in the last game.

7452
04:21:02,700 --> 04:21:04,360
It was great playing with Ristia again.

7453
04:21:04,540 --> 04:21:05,280
It's been a while.

7454
04:21:05,860 --> 04:21:07,720
Not even seven plus months.

7455
04:21:07,780 --> 04:21:10,580
It's been eight plus months since the last time we played with Ristia.

7456
04:21:10,580 --> 04:21:15,680
So I'm glad, like, you know, I reached out to Ristia to play this week.

7457
04:21:15,800 --> 04:21:17,580
And then we were like, let's play with RPR too.

7458
04:21:17,920 --> 04:21:18,740
And it's been fun.

7459
04:21:18,900 --> 04:21:20,460
I had a great time with both of them.

7460
04:21:20,740 --> 04:21:24,960
And it's nice to shoot my gun again.

7461
04:21:27,280 --> 04:21:28,220
Guys, see?

7462
04:21:28,340 --> 04:21:29,940
I'm not that washed.

7463
04:21:31,840 --> 04:21:33,540
I told you guys.

7464
04:21:33,800 --> 04:21:38,000
When I lock in, I'm not that washed.

7465
04:21:39,920 --> 04:21:42,760
I still hit some shots.

7466
04:21:45,100 --> 04:21:46,140
I still hit some shots.

7467
04:21:48,300 --> 04:21:49,560
I still hit some shots.

7468
04:21:49,620 --> 04:21:50,620
I still got it.

7469
04:21:50,760 --> 04:21:54,300
Soon I'll be a gold player again.

7470
04:21:57,760 --> 04:21:58,400
Anyway, guys.

7471
04:21:59,340 --> 04:22:01,100
I had a great time playing.

7472
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:03,560
Tomorrow we are...

7473
04:22:03,560 --> 04:22:05,140
By the way, I said no to the deadlock.

7474
04:22:05,340 --> 04:22:06,340
I haven't said no yet.

7475
04:22:06,460 --> 04:22:07,980
I haven't said no yet to the deadlock.

7476
04:22:08,000 --> 04:22:10,400
But I'm going to DM them and be like, I can't do it.

7477
04:22:10,500 --> 04:22:13,220
Because Surefour was like, yeah, maybe not.

7478
04:22:13,440 --> 04:22:14,980
And I was like, alright, I'm not doing it.

7479
04:22:16,080 --> 04:22:18,160
Because I was like, I don't fucking know what I'm doing.

7480
04:22:20,460 --> 04:22:24,880
So I'm going to DM them and be like, yeah, I'm going to say no to the invite.

7481
04:22:26,880 --> 04:22:27,940
I told you guys.

7482
04:22:28,100 --> 04:22:30,680
It heavily depended on if Surefour joins my team or not.

7483
04:22:30,860 --> 04:22:32,320
And he was like, yeah, maybe not.

7484
04:22:34,540 --> 04:22:36,760
So I'm not going to join that.

7485
04:22:38,000 --> 04:22:39,900
I'm not going to join that deadlock tournament.

7486
04:22:40,960 --> 04:22:41,480
Anyway.

7487
04:22:42,940 --> 04:22:47,020
Tomorrow we're going to learn deadlock tomorrow.

7488
04:22:47,260 --> 04:22:48,900
I have no idea.

7489
04:22:49,300 --> 04:22:51,000
I have no idea how it's going to go.

7490
04:22:51,180 --> 04:22:58,720
Because I think I touched deadlock like three times ever since I got into the beta test in April.

7491
04:22:59,700 --> 04:23:01,220
I've been in it since April.

7492
04:23:01,380 --> 04:23:04,060
And I've touched the game three times.

7493
04:23:04,500 --> 04:23:08,760
So tomorrow will be the fourth time I try deadlock.

7494
04:23:09,280 --> 04:23:10,120
So we'll see.

7495
04:23:10,320 --> 04:23:12,460
I hope you guys had a great time watching.

7496
04:23:12,760 --> 04:23:15,860
I was like, hanging out with the homies playing Apex.

7497
04:23:16,100 --> 04:23:18,120
And I hope you guys had a great time watching too.

7498
04:23:18,300 --> 04:23:23,140
As always everybody, stay hydrated, posture check, get up and move around to get that blood flowing.

7499
04:23:23,300 --> 04:23:25,240
And if you stay up for me, head to bed.

7500
04:23:25,360 --> 04:23:26,680
Because you deserve it.

7501
04:23:26,880 --> 04:23:28,260
I'll see you guys next time everybody.

7502
04:23:28,800 --> 04:23:29,460
Bye guys.

7503
04:23:29,740 --> 04:23:30,140
Bye.

7504
04:23:30,340 --> 04:23:31,760
Sorry we didn't have a long chat.

7505
04:23:31,760 --> 04:23:38,340
I'm trying not to overuse my voice this week because we did a lot of streams so far for this week.

7506
04:23:38,840 --> 04:23:40,960
And it was like in super long hours.

7507
04:23:41,020 --> 04:23:43,520
We've been doing like three plus hour streams the past week.

7508
04:23:43,660 --> 04:23:45,680
So this for this week.

7509
04:23:45,720 --> 04:23:47,780
So I'm trying not to overuse my voice.

7510
04:23:47,960 --> 04:23:51,000
So I'm really sorry that we haven't had some after stream chats in a bit.

7511
04:23:51,120 --> 04:23:54,780
But like the moment everything cools down we will bring them back.

7512
04:23:55,020 --> 04:23:56,280
Anyway guys, bye bye everybody.

7513
04:23:56,960 --> 04:23:57,400
Bye.
