1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:31,160
we're live we're just in professional exactly we don't we're not waiting for an intro technically you can think that the intro played already for like for like four minutes if you think about it because i started five minutes late the intro played in all our heads the intro was playing in our hearts chat it was there by default yeah yeah exactly you we were all clapping along to Yeah,

2
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,540
my chow's in it.

3
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,480
Live now.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,980
We're actually finishing this game.

5
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,540
Yes, we're finishing.

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,960
Apparently we were like 60% already.

7
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,380
60%?

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,460
Yeah, it's a short game.

9
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,080
It's technically a short game.

10
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,760
Is it a short game where we just played that long?

11
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,380
No, we played like three hours, didn't we?

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,200
Like, games back then in 2000s were really short because they were not $80.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,980
They were...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:02:18,220
yeah they were not it feels like it's 80 i'm pretty sure yeah well it's 80 now it's 80 dollars i don't even remember wait how much is here so wait let me check actually how much is now that steam is not crashing because of silk song imagine if you're not you don't even know about silk song and you try it you're just on steam trying to download something and during the great silk song crash they're like oh it's 50 dollars holy what the end though wait retail price for gears of war original how much was the original gears of war hell i don't remember all three of the original titles are on sale now of gold for okay that's like okay that's when it was on sale guys how much how much was the original gears of war for retail you can buy gears of war on the xbox 360 for 23 dollars the original xbox game 23 23 Canadian dollars so I'm just like wondering how much was it retail like when it first came out though it was $60 Canadian okay that wasn't so bad $60 Canadian that's pretty all right

15
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:25,080
like oh wait but then to account for inflation that's like more than 80.

16
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:58,240
if you think about it yeah I would guess so i would be if you count for inflation that is actually more than 80 dollars like i could just buy a mario crate like i remember black ops 2 were like around 60 or 55 dollars i thought they used to be 40 dollars back then i didn't realize they were 60 old dollars what that's crazy for that for that agent holy crap like 68 hey man wait i'm in a back-end country no i mean like No,

17
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,360
60 US for you or Indonesian.

18
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,180
I'd have it.

19
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,820
Should be around that.

20
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,880
Yeah, I'm saying.

21
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,280
I thought they were like $40 back then.

22
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,200
I didn't realize they were that expensive.

23
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,480
And why were we completing anything about $80?

24
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,400
If we account for inflation.

25
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,440
Because like, then that's just inflation, right?

26
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,140
Because I feel like if we account for inflation, it would, and it makes sense it's $80.

27
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
$80 is in...

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:04:27,300
If you account for inflation, okay what is what is sixty dollars inflate oh your wage oh wait sorry wages didn't increase to i forgot i forgot wages never increased yeah wages never kept up i'm thinking because like for inflation um for inflation i think about movie ticket sales because that's why people like to account for like prices you how they're like oh if the titanic came out in 2025 it would have made x amount of money so i like think like that but i forgot like wages never increased though they're still the same wages increase yeah i know they do minimum wage will still be the same after 50 years to learn more about the same since 10 years to learn more about years of war inflation you should years of war inflation

29
00:04:30,800 --> 00:05:06,900
what's a sonic inflation uh it was when like sonic used to be cheaper back then in uh 2000 and if you want to know like the exact number you should google sonic inflation inflation is it stated in the rule 34 well well it was originally in rule 69 but they moved it to rule 34 because they felt like it was a better They felt like this this specific rule regarding like the inflation of prices on Sonic mattered more How can you say this in a straight face?

30
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,920
It's because I am a professional gaslighter Yeah, all right, I forgot about that I am a professional gaslighter.

31
00:05:16,160 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay, I have a lot of experience and I am also he has been very bratty lately He he interrupted my spot stream because you were watching my sponsor stream right for a while yeah so I was like oh my god he got closer he walked up to my door yeah it got so much louder he walked up to my door so um he interrupted because I was with Tim to tap man and ninja and obviously I couldn't I had to mute myself because I didn't want them to hear my fucking dog barking and so like I have to ignore him because he's kind of like he'll win um so you're gonna have to put up with this what what what um basically um he like was barking because he wanted food early but he wanted food at like three p.m yeah at three p.m i was like he wanted his lunch his dinner at three p.m because he already had his regular,

32
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,000
he already had lunch.

33
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,100
So he wanted his dinner at 3 p.m.

34
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,480
and he walked away because I closed the door on him.

35
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,300
Yeah, the worst thing is my door isn't an actual door.

36
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,720
It's like a glass plane.

37
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,320
So like there's like glass in the center.

38
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,340
So like, like, like he just, he just look at me through the glass.

39
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,020
He's just peeking through that.

40
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,280
Yeah, he can just look at me.

41
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,040
He knows what's going on inside the room.

42
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, look at the man's food.

43
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,160
So it doesn't even...

44
00:06:49,180 --> 00:08:02,100
do anything yeah so so i had to feed so he won because i had to feed him at 3 p.m because i was like i needed i can't just stop because i'm nearly sponsored to be on that stream so like like there was nothing i could do and i didn't want to fucking like bother the stream like bothered the sponsor right you're sponsored and he isn't like he wins he gets to have anything he wants he knows true he knows too he's like you can't do anything about it i can still hear yeah he is he's like he's just barking from from like his bed right now i don't know what he's barking about he's he's he's had food his water bowl is filled up he's literally just barking because he wants more food that's really good because he's a pig yeah he loves to eat he's like food he's food motivated but the thing is he never wants the food to stop he doesn't he thinks that like the food should never stop like you you take that back how much does he weigh um well he got like really he got really fat um when i was on my

45
00:08:02,100 --> 00:09:12,500
business trip because um he was on steroids uh for like because okay not because like i wanted him to get jacked up or anything uh it was for a medical reason okay it's not because i wanted my dog to have a fucking six pack but he had to be on steroids because um he uh sprained uh he had like a small disc issue around his neck area so like they're like oh we shouldn't do surgery we should just let him recover so i gave him to the dog sitter because i also had a business trip to for the marvel rivals stuff and and then so they gave him steroids to help with recovery so he'll his like his like front paw his front legs would be stronger hell yeah yes and then apparently so apparently no the side effect is that he gets like like he he puts on more weight so when i like first got him back he was there like times to the size and when i dropped him off yeah so i was like oh my god he's so like thick now and i think he's like and also like my dog sitter spoils him she like sent me a picture

52
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,440

00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,370
Okay, yeah, it's F.

144
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,030
It is.

145
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,590
What the fuck is this room?

146
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,190
I'm revving it up.

147
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,250
I don't know.

148
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,530
I'm revving it up.

149
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,990
Okay, I gotta, no, give me that ammo.

150
00:15:59,250 --> 00:15:59,890
It's easy.

151
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,310
God damn it.

152
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,870
I have no idea what he's barking about, too.

153
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,930
That's the worst part.

154
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,870
It's a little muted because I closed the door.

155
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:19,910
He'll get tired.

156
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:20,730
Don't worry.

157
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,350
He'll get tired eventually.

158
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,990
He'll get tired eventually.

159
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,250
It's like a hyperactive kid.

160
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,530
Yeah, he'll tie himself up.

161
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:31,910
Or not.

162
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,710
It'll happen eventually.

163
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,990
Okay, bring the game up a little more.

164
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,730
Okay, I forgot to say, sorry, I paused it.

165
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,750
Oh wait, it does not pause.

166
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:44,670
God damn, I forgot.

167
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:45,950

Your mission is to just live.

275
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,410
The audio is so weird.

276
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,190
I'm hearing footsteps and everything.

277
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:43,050
And you're also hearing my dog barking.

278
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,610
Yeah, so it doesn't help at all.

279
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,170
He'll never...

280
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,710
He'll never know what to do.

281
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,770

I was in the middle of the road.

317
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,810
Okay, I forgot I had pushed the mute.

318
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,010
Wait, pause the game.

319
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,530
I had pushed the mute.

320
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:23,530
Okay.

321
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,310
I pressed one.

322
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,010
I forgot.

323
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,730
I had pushed a mute for my earlier stream.

324
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:29,530
Okay.

325
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:29,910
Let me.

326
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:30,950
Oh my God.

327
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:31,330
Here you go.

328
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,950
You have pushed me on one?

329
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,610
Because I couldn't use my mouse button.

330
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,830
Because one was for...

331
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,670
One was for I need healing.

332
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,550
And the other one was melee.

333
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:41,950
What?

334
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:43,130
Yes.

335
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,170
I put my mouse button for I need healing.

336
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,250
Because it's efficient.

337
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,890
Also press start and pause the game.

338
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,610
Player one.

339
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,130
Okay.

340
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:50,670
Okay.

341
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,530
Here you go.

342
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,030
Where am I talking?

343
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,070

346
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,550
Oh my god, now he's barking from a forest.

347
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,790
Okay.

348
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,810
Oh my, they're still like the turret guy.

349
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,490
I can't see the third guy yet.

350
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:47,450
He's like too much.

351
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:47,730
Okay.

352
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,810
I'm trying to shoot him, but he has so much HP.

353
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,030

I shot at them.

359
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,010
It looked like enemies.

360
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,590
Why is it always people wearing helmets?

361
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:11,650
It is always.

362
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,170
They don't have rights.

363
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,110
That's why they're faceless.

364
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,370
Go ahead, clear the way.

365
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,270
You catch up when you can.

366
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,200
Traveling Conservatory.

367
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,500
This is Delta 1.

368
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,820
Delta 2 is caring for wounded and flagging for pickup.

369
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,780
Is it conservatory clear?

370
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,380
Then that's all you're shaking hips.

371
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,480
It's so loud, you know?

372
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,780
Shakira, Shakira.

373
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh my god, finally peace at last.

374
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,220
Vaude Watchers skip 30 minutes.

375
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,300
Vaude Watchers skips 30 minutes.

376
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,680
For him to stop.

377
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,340
Guys, look, I won.

378
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,320

380
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,760
there was a very tiny dog.

381
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,160
There was a very tiny dog.

382
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,140
Like, it's, like, it's like small, like those teacup dogs, you know?

383
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:37,740
Mm-hmm.

384
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,640
And then it was minding its own business, just, like, walking the streets.

385
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,240
And he tried, if he was not, like, leashed up, it wasn't, like, um...

386
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,300
With his harness and everything.

387
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,420
He, like, tried to run straight at him.

388
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,900
Like, hold on, like, ran, try to run straight at the tiny teacup dog and, like, barked at him, too.

389
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:00,360

Never had steroids.

393
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,020
I don't know.

394
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,580
Never had one.

395
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,340
I don't even know if it's legal here or not.

396
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,460
It should be legal.

397
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:09,880
Steroids.

398
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,420
It's just that steroids is an actual medication.

399
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,600
But, like, people just abused it to get extra buff.

400
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,140
To get a sport advantage.

401
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,360
I'm just...

402
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:22,940
I can see where he is.

403
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,140
It's, like, right next to me.

404
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:26,400
Alright.

405
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,920

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,660
Why?

407
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,360

00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,280
Wait, what?

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,020
We're okay.

414
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,440
Oh, what the heck?

415
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:15,760

Boom!

419
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,600

420
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,240
Well, then okay.

421
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,580
Dom, let's drop the hammer.

422
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:28,740
Boom!

423
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,260
Nice.

424
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,100
I got a headshot.

425
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,620
Oh, God.

426
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,620
Did you have...

427
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,320
Is that your...

428
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:40,860
What?

429
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,540
A gun is a gun.

430
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:44,260
Nice.

431
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:45,300
Nice shot.

432
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,960
It would be crazy if you missed that shot.

433
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,820
Not gonna lie.

434
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,580
It's a laser pointer.

435
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,900
How do you miss a laser pointer?

436
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,540
That's what I'm saying.

437
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,560
It would be crazy if you missed.

438
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,120
How would you miss a laser pointer?

439
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,700
It's like pinpointing a presentation.

440
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,200
Oh, yeah, there's only two of us now.

441
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:03,900
God damn it.

442
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,040
Wait, there's only two of us?

443
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,360
No.

444
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,440
Players three and four.

445
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,960
You were never real.

446
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,380
It was all in their heads.

447
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,760
The fuck was that?

448
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,420
Okay, you said something.

449
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,160
I vaguely remember this.

450
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,380
What do I vaguely remember this?

451
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,240
I don't know anything.

452
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,300
Oh, hey, there's ammo.

453
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,100
Oh, there's another ray.

454
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,840
Is it what I think it is?

455
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,820
Does the ray require ammo?

456
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,240
Because you can grab one right now.

457
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,600
No, it's just a cooldown.

458
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,460
I like my gun.

459
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,140
You know what?

460
00:33:38,380 --> 00:34:08,780

461
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,840
it's probably a good source of protein, though.

462
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,540
That's true.

463
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,460
Plants are technically zombies.

464
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,520
True.

465
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,220
Is their brain dead?

466
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,500
Oh, shit!

467
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,500
That's why.

468
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,420
That's why.

469
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:23,020
Oh, fuck.

470
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:23,680
That's why.

471
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,560
It's new, snooze.

472
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,380
It's...

473
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,060
Wait, it's okay.

474
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,420
She can't get past here.

475
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,360
It's okay.

476
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,580
We have a barrier between her and us.

477
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:33,920
See?

478
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,000
It's okay.

479
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,160
She can't get here.

480
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,460
I can't use the hammer down here.

481
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,200
There's a roof.

482
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,760
Oh, okay.

483
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,080
It's okay.

484
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,400
We can run past it.

485
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,620
We can run past it now.

486
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,140
She gone.

487
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,600
Goodbye, Tengen.

488
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,920
I'll always remember your heroic acts.

489
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,080
Woo!

490
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,660
I'll always remember what you did for us.

491
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:58,620
Whoa!

492
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,000

00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,460
What happened?

494
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,180
He roars through a wall like a cool-aid.

495
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,420
He did a cool-aid guy.

496
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,180
He was a cool-aid guy.

497
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,240
Oh, wait, wait.

498
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:09,940
Distractive.

499
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,280
Distractive.

500
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:10,860
Don't come here.

501
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,360
Distractive.

502
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:11,840
Distractive.

503
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:12,620
Distractive.

504
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,420
Distractive.

505
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,000

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,900
Oh, he's supposed to break the pillars.

511
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,440
The pillars.

512
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,140
Affirmative.

513
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,420

No, nothing happens.

527
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,180
That was as far as my plan was gonna go.

00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,220
Oh no, there's one more.

529
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:27,780
There's one more pillar.

530
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,580
We forgot one more pillar.

531
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,220
There's one more on the other side.

532
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:31,900
There's two more.

533
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,060
Oh, shit.

534
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:33,680

535
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,360

00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,580
You got this.

537
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,220

How could you miss that?

545
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,180
That was the most obvious.

546
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,220
Okay, now I don't...

547
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,260
I think we might be stuck, though, after that.

548
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,540
There's an open wall.

549
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,780

00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,420
We're stuck here.

554
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,320
We are stuck here.

555
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,160

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,000
Okay.

566
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,620

Do we just go this way?

601
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,750
I guess we leave where we came from.

602
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,510

639
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,330
You remember that part in Brokeback Mountain?

640
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,810

641
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:40,610
When you don't remember, it was like a little bit of a horror section in there.

642
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:43,350
Like you think, and then you're like, it's like a little plot twist.

00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,550
And then you found out, like, the sister is actually adopted.

645
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:53,820

648
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,920
They were being chased around the mountain.

649
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,660
Because they all, they went to hike at Brokeback Mountain.

650
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:15,560

651
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:19,000
And in that cabin, they found out that the sister was adopted.

652
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,100
Are you sure you watched Brokeback Mountain?

653
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,440
Like, what the fuck?

654
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:26,840
Like, you said you watched it several times!

655
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,060
You said you watched it several times!

656
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,200
I just know something about Mountain.

657
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:32,220
I don't know exactly what.

658
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,080
Okay, what do you remember about Brokeback Mountain?

659
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,320
Nothing particular.

660
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,280
Like, is there anything that you remember other than the fact that...

661
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,020
I'm gonna be out of here, too.

662
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:46,680
I'm the type of guy who would watch anime and then forget the episode that I watched yesterday.

663
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,800
It's like a fucking Oscar movie.

664
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,700
I know, but it applies to anything.

665
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,040
Like, oh yeah, I played the campaign.

666
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:55,660
What did you remember?

667
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,840
Try to remember one thing from Brookbat Mountain.

668
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,440
Because you say you used to watch it with your mom all the time, right?

669
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,120
Good to go.

670
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,940
One thing.

671
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,480
One thing.

672
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,300
One thing.

673
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:10,280
Can I remember one thing?

674
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:14,340
Well, about me watching it with my mom?

675
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,640
No, about the movie.

676
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:16,620
Because you watched this.

677
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,800
Yeah, hell no, I wouldn't remember that.

678
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:18,900
What did you remember?

679
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,780
What do you remember?

680
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,920
Other than the mountain.

681
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,680
Me shitting myself?

682
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:24,600
Why?

683
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:24,860
Why?

684
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:25,820
Because of the horror part?

685
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,400
No, I had a diarrhea.

686
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,420
Oh, you...

687
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,960
So you don't remember the chase scene in Brokeback Mountain, where they're being chased on the mountain.

688
00:48:38,600 --> 00:49:33,820
not at all i am like especially horrors right i don't remember horrors yeah but it wasn't it was like a drama it was like it was mostly a drama movie though so like so it's like basically it was like i remember it was like a brother and sister and they were like they went to the cabin yeah and then they went to the cabin just remember that they were brothers yeah but then how could you forget the main plot where like the sister was actually not his sister because like his parents cheated like the mom cheated on the dad you actually don't remember why is it why why is that the problem no because it was just that was really good because i wanted oscar anyway brookbeck mount is actually about gay cowboys and i was fucking with you

689
00:49:37,340 --> 00:50:02,500
brookbeck my mouth is actually about gay cowboys it was not about it was not even there was no brother and sister you're so there was not it wasn't even about brother and sister it was about two i remember i remember watching some movie about something about like my mom with my mom i don't remember anything that's like that's what chad my chad was like he watched it with his mom

690
00:50:08,600 --> 00:51:40,900
oh that's not it was there there were some explicit scenes about these gay cowboys all right but yeah it's a different set of mountains all right where do we go uh that way probably probably why can't we cross that what the is this is just it's just these kind of rubbles like why why can't we swim can we not swim because we're too we're too we're too bugged our muscles our muscles will cause us to sink into the ocean they start getting naked at like the third installment oh yeah sweet i wish for the fans it's the fan service yeah yeah tangent oh what the fuck you see that guy yeah wait you're talking you think he knows you don't need to not die stop that how do we not never look at what no okay that's a point-blank grenade i know it's like holy shit he did oh my god oh he shot the ground and let's oh apparently they're really resilient in higher difficulty so they'll have like they actually just have more they're just more tough more health more damage it's like beef jerky is it is it

691
00:51:40,900 --> 00:52:08,220
that what hard difficulty is supposed to be i mean that makes sense they're they always do yeah they just like they just make them into what do we just tell them yeah i know what the we open the door why can't we just go seamless oh i think it's because it's a loading screen back then yeah what's going on probably well there's a bunch of ass you can't be bothered to make it seamless um that's for when they re-release this game a fifth time Oh,

692
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,800
there they are.

693
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:12,440
What?

694
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,120
Oh, shit.

695
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:13,800
Here they come.

696
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:15,440
I don't even see where they are.

697
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:16,940
They're above us.

698
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,760
All right, he's going to peek, right?

699
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,100
He's peeked.

700
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:23,600
He's going to boom.

701
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:24,480
Boom.

702
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,300

00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,380
Oh, oh, my God.

704
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,500

Not now.

707
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:34,900
I dodged that.

708
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,100
Whoa.

709
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,000

00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,820
I'm going to boom this guy in the back.

714
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,260
There's a guy literally behind you that's just chasing you.

715
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,580
What's with the AIs, man?

716
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,920
He's been chasing you the entire time.

717
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,380
Boom.

00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,800

All right.

721
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:27,440
Boom.

722
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,980
Yeah, I'll take that.

723
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,180
Up there.

724
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:32,820
Wait, I'm trying.

725
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,440
Oh my god, you started to cutscene, so I couldn't grab the ammo.

726
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:38,960
That's crazy.

727
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,000
Why is there a cutscene?

728
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,040
I don't know where.

729
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,520
Inside the house, there might be locust tunnels inside.

730
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,880
Copy that, Anya.

731
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:47,960
We are aware.

732
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,260
Oh my god, my wire is like snagged in my...

733
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:52,740
Oh, they're here.

734
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,700
Oh no.

735
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,660
What's up, ladies?

736
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:56,760
Locust.

737
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,840
Is it the A-train?

738
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,560
There's something else here too.

739
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:00,740
An APC behind the house.

740
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,700
Oh my god, my head was stuck on my bed.

741
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:05,220
No offense.

742
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:05,640
Ah.

743
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,140
No.

744
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,000
It's in the wheels.

745
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:18,460
Stop barking and my wires stuck on my chair wheels.

746
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,080
I'm a mess.

747
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,680
The dog's still barking.

748
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:26,260
Oh my god.

749
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,620
Okay, you gotta protect me.

750
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:29,580
I gotta fix my wires.

751
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:31,340
Why?

752
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,680
This stream's a mess.

753
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,440
There's nothing, so we're chilling.

754
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,900
I got this dungeon!

755
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,580
Yeah, I got you covered.

756
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,840
Oh my god, it's stuck, stuck.

757
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,420
I accidentally...

758
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:48,740
Okay.

759
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,600
I actually rolled my wires.

760
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:52,420
Okay, I got it.

761
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:54,100
I got it and I got a t-shirt.

762
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,820
I am going to tag.

763
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:56,420
Stop barking.

764
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:57,560
You okay?

765
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,020
Is it tangling the wires again?

766
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,180
It's a bit too empty now.

767
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,100
I'm back!

768
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,200
I did my task!

769
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,060
Alright.

770
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,100
We did it.

771
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,060
Oh wait, there was nobody.

772
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:27,580
Okay.

773
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,860
We should be really safe.

774
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,560
We're so safe.

775
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:31,880
Let's go.

776
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,900
I hoped.

777
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,380
We're at Resident Evil.

778
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,540
Oh, now it's Resident Evil.

779
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:40,280
It's Resident Evil 1.

780
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:41,500
Yeah.

781
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:42,660
Jill!

782
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:43,600
Look out!

783
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,140
Jill!

784
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,420
Jill!

785
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,000
Look out, behind you!

786
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,580
My berry sandwich!

787
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,260
Berry!

788
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:55,360
Nice!

789
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,600
I was gonna tank this.

790
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,100
We can destroy the box, god damn it.

791
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:02,740
There you go.

792
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,880
This actually looks like the Resident Evil house, not gonna lie.

793
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,140
The Wesker Mansion.

794
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:08,900
Yeah.

795
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,300
Do I think I live this?

796
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,940
Yeah, I was gonna say, do I live this standing in front of that?

00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:26,070
Yeah, in gears.

800
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:33,390
You know, like back then, people would just like rob historical items and just bring it home.

801
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:36,650
Put it in museums and stuff.

802
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:37,530
Isn't that fuck?

803
00:57:38,670 --> 00:57:40,610
Anyway, I love the British Museum.

804
00:57:42,350 --> 00:57:44,050
I think I'm blocked.

805
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,350
Wait, he destroyed my fucking thing!

806
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:51,930
He destroyed my cover.

807
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:52,710
That's fucked up.

808
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,310
Oh wait, that's you.

809
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,670
No, someone's behind you.

810
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:56,690
No, I shot you.

811
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:58,730
Why are you shooting me?

812
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,270
Because you look like a locust.

813
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:04,410
What can I say?

814
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:06,710
How is that racist?

815
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,770
What are you trying to say about the locust, huh?

816
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:12,710
No, that's fucked up.

817
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:15,050
Are you trying to say something bad about the locust?

818
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,090
Wow, now that's racist.

819
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,030

APCs online.

01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:24,670
I don't think I was supposed to do that.

862
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:25,750
I was just as confused.

863
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,130
They were like, you were not supposed to stand there.

864
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:29,730
Watch this.

865
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:32,250
They won't know.

866
01:00:32,610 --> 01:00:33,290
Check your ammo.

867
01:00:34,750 --> 01:00:35,350
They won't know.

868
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,130
How would they know?

869
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,410
That's a lot of footsteps above us.

870
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:42,510
Oh, crap.

871
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,490
That's a little scary.

872
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,990
Don't worry, they won't know.

01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:30,010

I told you.

883
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,210
That's the fastest door opening.

884
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:39,450
That's the strat.

885
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:40,050
Cut scene.

886
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:40,530
Cut scene.

887
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:40,910
Nice.

888
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:41,690
Our little movie.

889
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:44,050
This is where we get our bathroom break.

890
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:46,530
Commercial break.

891
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,240
All right.

892
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,980
We're so safe.

893
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:05,650
Jack, log in and see what you can find.

894
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,630
Search his Google history, too.

895
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:13,620
All right, on you.

896
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,880
All right, it's time to grab a popcorn.

897
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,300
This is a five hour cutscene.

898
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:20,520
This is the five hour cutscene.

899
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,780
Yeah, this is how they pad out the time.

900
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,240
They pad out the next two hours of this game.

901
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:35,910
What in the fuck?

902
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:38,350
I take it that qualifies as an update.

903
01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:39,470
to get the job done.

904
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:41,410
More than enough.

905
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:43,230
Then let's get out of here.

906
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:44,530
How the fuck do we?

907
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:45,550
I can't.

908
01:02:45,830 --> 01:02:47,710
The files are too big for this bandwidth.

909
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:48,970
What the fuck?

910
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,910
What do you mean the files are too big?

911
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:53,910
You can get an SSD.

912
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,770
Yeah, grab an SSD.

913
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:57,790
How many terabytes do you need?

914
01:02:58,030 --> 01:02:59,790
I thought we were living in the future.

915
01:03:00,290 --> 01:03:01,250
Give us your location.

916
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:03,090

01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:00,240
Wait, did they like...

No, maybe they had...

929
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,700
Some of them that were carrying like flanks and nails and just hammering it up.

930
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,200

Oh, he's coming.

939
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:17,460

943
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:31,240

He's very slowly walking for it.

948
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:45,440
Very slowly, very intimately.

949
01:07:47,380 --> 01:07:49,380
Oh my god, there's so much illusions!

01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,400

Don't worry, I'm right next to you.

952
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,280
We can just pick each other out.

953
01:07:56,500 --> 01:07:57,300
For fuck's sake.

954
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:58,500
Boom.

955
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,420
The boom guy's not dead or just more.

01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,280
Um, there's, I think it's another boom guy.

982
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,460
Yeah, Yoda is Gandalf.

983
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:25,620
Gandalf with a Glock.

984
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,540
Yeah, we'll see Gandalf of a Glock.

985
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:34,320
Let's get this bridge down.

986
01:12:34,620 --> 01:12:36,900
No, no, I want to see Lord of the Rings set in 2025.

987
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,020

01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:40,940
In 2020.

989
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:45,660
Is this the way?

990
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:47,920
There you go.

991
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:52,360
I want to know how the Lord of the Rings gang going to deal with COVID.

992
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:54,180

You piece of...

998
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,700
What even happened?

999
01:13:06,140 --> 01:13:08,280
A bird's closed down a little bit.

1000
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:11,280
It's the locust.

1001
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:13,880
Wait, oh, wait.

1002
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:14,720
Who is Mark again?

1003
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:15,920
They're not that important.

1004
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,640
Oh, it's the guy that's not coal.

1005
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,480
It's the guy that's not coal.

1006
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:24,320
The coal tree.

1007
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:59,240
the bridge is jammed then we got unjammed seriously stop getting pregnant like what the hell is the population of yeah i know like what's the consensus here like what is the mortality rate and the birth rate who is making them are they like how fast do they grow very fast There's like four of us,

1008
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:01,000
and we've killed so many of them.

1009
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:05,140
But, oh my god.

1010
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:05,580
Oh, come on.

What?

1015
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:09,920
He wears a helmet.

1016
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,820
How is he, like, still alive?

1017
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,940
I shot him in the head, I think.

1018
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:17,960
Maybe he's wearing a helmet.

1019
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,380
No, he's not.

1020
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:22,240
If he's wearing a head, he should die.

1021
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:25,100
Oh, now I got a headshot after hitting him, like, seven times.

1022
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:25,600
Grenade!

1023
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:27,060
Oh, my god.

01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:34,820
I missed my one There you go That sounded clear.

1025
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:36,080
This is bullshit.

1026
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:37,700
They were waiting for us.

1027
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:41,180
They know what we're doing Control this is Delta.

1028
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,140
We're stuck at an open drawbridge.

1029
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:45,100
We need to restore power to this sector.

1030
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:45,900

1031
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:52,140

Maybe.

1040
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,780
Like 220 at least.

1041
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:21,500
Parade it down.

1042
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,640
All right, then.

1043
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,340
That's why shotgun is so good.

1044
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,300
Oh, whoa.

1045
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:28,220
What was that?

1046
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:29,680

1047
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,440
You go first.

1048
01:15:32,720 --> 01:15:33,920
You go first.

1049
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:35,020
I did not like that.

1050
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:36,600
Don't worry, you're the main character.

1051
01:15:36,820 --> 01:15:37,660
You're not going to die.

1052
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,960
Main character doesn't die.

1053
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:41,920
Main character never dies.

1054
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:44,100
I don't like that noise, Rook.

1055
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,720

Yeah, well, screw my old man.

1057
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,220

01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,180

1079
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,500
They started screaming.

1080
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,090

01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:16,170
Boom.

1087
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:18,210
Nice.

1088
01:19:20,350 --> 01:19:20,630
That's right.

1089
01:19:20,730 --> 01:19:22,530
We have the hot girl now.

1090
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:24,390
Oh my god, a poor man.

1091
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:30,970
I wish I was what I would have said if he wasn't a goddamn disgusting locus.

1092
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:32,730
What can I throw this?

1093
01:19:34,930 --> 01:19:35,930
A cave well?

1094
01:19:38,290 --> 01:19:39,690
I can make the shot.

1095
01:19:41,910 --> 01:19:42,090
Okay.

1096
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:44,270
Yeah, sure.

1097
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:45,470
Yeah.

1098
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:46,050
Yeah.

1099
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:47,930
Nice day.

1100
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:49,630
Look, it wasn't about...

1101
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:50,370
It's the wind, okay?

1102
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,290
I didn't account for...

1103
01:19:51,290 --> 01:19:54,090
The wind was blowing against the current.

1104
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:56,690
The current?

1105
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:57,930
Yeah, yeah.

1106
01:19:57,990 --> 01:20:00,870
It was blowing against the current, so that's not my fault.

1107
01:20:01,450 --> 01:20:01,870
It was a...

1108
01:20:01,870 --> 01:20:04,470
There was a Typhoon 3 warning, okay?

1109
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:08,290
That would have made it in if it wasn't for the Typhoon 3 warning.

1110
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:11,150
But it's this way.

1111
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,510
Yeah, it's pretty windy, huh?

1112
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:14,810
Yeah, it's very windy.

1113
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,670
It's crazy how windy it is.

1114
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:43,730

How is he here?

1116
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:50,030
Oh, there's an open door.

1117
01:20:50,650 --> 01:20:53,410
Oh my god, they just opened that door after we killed that one guy.

1118
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,370
Not a one, not a door, a window.

1119
01:20:58,570 --> 01:20:59,970
Oh, die, what the fuck?

1120
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:02,710
I thought you fucking wrestled him, what the fuck?

1121
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:03,570
That's right.

1122
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:04,570
Oh, he closed.

1123
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:07,050
What the fuck is going on?

1124
01:21:07,070 --> 01:21:07,570
What the fuck is going on?

1125
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:09,150
I don't know what's going on.

1126
01:21:09,290 --> 01:21:10,630
And opening something, what the fuck?

1127
01:21:10,970 --> 01:21:12,830
It just closed by itself.

1128
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:14,990
They're like, all right, now you can progress.

1129
01:21:16,370 --> 01:21:16,730
All right.

1130
01:21:16,730 --> 01:21:18,090
Come on, keep that door.

1131
01:21:18,910 --> 01:21:19,850
Oh, yeah.

1132
01:21:19,850 --> 01:21:20,670
Oh, never mind.

1133
01:21:21,070 --> 01:21:21,650
What's the void of the gig?

1134
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:23,610
What's the void of the gig?

1135
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:25,430
What's the void of the gig?

1136
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:26,490
Yo, what's up?

1137
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,350
Got to be close to this power.

1138
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,410
Sorry, hit 9 p.m.

1139
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:30,270
I've got a close shot.

1140
01:21:31,010 --> 01:21:31,910
I think so.

1141
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,070
Just up ahead.

1142
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,010
Across the park by that old theater.

1143
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:37,970
Move out and get Jack to start the repairs.

1144
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:39,730
We'll meet you at the power line.

1145
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:43,650
Oh, there is a lot.

1146
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,990
Nope.

1147
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:46,710
Nope.

1148
01:21:48,070 --> 01:21:49,570
Shit, that's a lot of enemies.

1149
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:52,690
Where are they?

1150
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:54,670
There was a lot.

1151
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:55,790
There were a lot in the freaking...

1152
01:21:56,410 --> 01:21:57,330
Yeah, there was a lot.

1153
01:21:57,330 --> 01:21:57,690
Yeah, where are they?

1154
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:59,090
There was a lot.

1155
01:21:59,250 --> 01:21:59,890
So dramatic.

1156
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:04,830
Oh, got rid of...

1157
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,610
Oh, yeah, no, there is a lot.

1158
01:22:10,850 --> 01:22:12,130
Oh, wait, never mind.

1159
01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:14,930
There's one guy in the turret.

1160
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,050
I'm just gonna kill the regular guys.

1161
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,110
Boom.

1162
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:23,750
Well, I'm going to move up.

1163
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:24,550
We got to move up.

1164
01:22:25,090 --> 01:22:25,830
Oh, you don't have to.

1165
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:26,630
He has a helmet.

1166
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:28,390
I'm going up.

1167
01:22:30,110 --> 01:22:30,350
Cover.

1168
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:32,390
Oh, nice.

1169
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:36,830
Oh, reload.

1170
01:22:37,210 --> 01:22:37,490
Nice.

1171
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:39,770
What's the point of me shooting them?

1172
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:40,790
You're just going to headshot them.

1173
01:22:40,930 --> 01:22:41,430
That's all I'm going to say.

1174
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:42,370
Oh, shit.

1175
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:43,950
What happened?

1176
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:48,950
He attacked a bench and then the bed, it exploded through the bench.

1177
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:51,330
It was fucking crazy.

1178
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,250
It actually boomed.

1179
01:22:56,170 --> 01:22:56,350
There you go.

1180
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:57,190
Now I can kill him.

1181
01:22:57,350 --> 01:22:58,330
That's fucking right.

1182
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:00,050
Boom yourself.

1183
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:01,530
What the fuck?

1184
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,990
We're shooting the turret guy because he's too busy looking at you.

1185
01:23:05,130 --> 01:23:05,570
Oh, okay.

1186
01:23:06,790 --> 01:23:07,530
Did you need him?

1187
01:23:08,270 --> 01:23:08,950
Yeah, I did.

1188
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:11,230
Oh, crap.

1189
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:12,670
Oh, there's food.

1190
01:23:13,350 --> 01:23:14,570
We've killed two before.

1191
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:15,890
It's not that bad.

1192
01:23:16,650 --> 01:23:17,410
That's true.

1193
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:18,910
I got a turret this time.

1194
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:26,230
Okay, he's just looking at, oh, nice, okay.

1195
01:23:27,750 --> 01:23:28,170
Holy shit.

1196
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:30,410
Yeah, these guys were not that bad.

1197
01:23:31,910 --> 01:23:32,630
Oh, what the fuck?

1198
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:34,550
I'm inside, by the way.

1199
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:36,250
Don't worry, I'll activate the cutscene.

1200
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:37,870
Okay, you gotta kill him.

1201
01:23:37,970 --> 01:23:38,350
Never mind.

1202
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,530
Never mind.

1203
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:40,370
Never mind.

1204
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,530
We have to kill him.

1205
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:43,410
Oh, we have to?

1206
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:45,490
Yeah, I think so, because the door is not opening.

1207
01:23:45,630 --> 01:23:48,570
Unless it's like the main character has to opening it.

1208
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:50,890
What about?

1209
01:23:51,010 --> 01:23:51,490
Okay, there you go.

1210
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:52,290
That's a clear music.

1211
01:23:52,730 --> 01:23:52,990
There you go.

1212
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:53,470
God damn it.

1213
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:54,110
The clear music.

1214
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:55,270
Dude, a power line.

1215
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:56,550
So can we now open this door?

1216
01:23:58,710 --> 01:23:59,110
Boom.

1217
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:00,570
Okay, I fucking knew it.

1218
01:24:00,590 --> 01:24:04,050
I was like, it has to be like main character buff or some shit.

1219
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:08,870
Player two is not allowed to open the door.

1220
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:12,190
He's like, you're not player one.

1221
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:14,930
You're not, you're not the main character.

1222
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:16,930
But you're dumb, man.

1223
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:17,870
What's your status?

1224
01:24:18,330 --> 01:24:19,130
I want to be dumb.

1225
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:29,470
Yeah, but you're bending Yeah, but I want to be Dom Yeah, but Dom isn't in any famous TV show What's that?

1226
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:35,570

1227
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:41,250
Oh Cole train Is Cole gonna die?

1228
01:24:47,850 --> 01:24:55,250
Totally insane Yay, we live At least we're not players three or four.

1229
01:24:57,790 --> 01:24:59,710
Because you're not like them.

1230
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,090
Oh, they made a hole.

1231
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:03,710
Don't worry.

1232
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:05,770
Oh, shit.

1233
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:09,270

01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,010
Yeah, I saw.

1236
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:14,330
I did it for the cause.

1237
01:25:15,290 --> 01:25:16,210
I did it for the cause.

1238
01:25:16,610 --> 01:25:17,150
Yeah, that's right.

1239
01:25:19,730 --> 01:25:21,390
Wait, what the fuck?

1240
01:25:21,570 --> 01:25:22,230

01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,210
Okay, I guess that works too.

1252
01:25:44,850 --> 01:25:45,290
That works.

1253
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:46,390

And now I aura one.

1255
01:25:55,900 --> 01:26:55,360

01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:02,680
Shit!

1260
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,300

Oh, okay.

That's right.

1300
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:47,370
His feet is very sensitive.

1301
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:49,850
He has sensitive feces.

1302
01:28:50,970 --> 01:28:52,170
Oh, look at him.

1303
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:52,710
His feet.

What are they called?

1305
01:28:58,430 --> 01:29:00,830
You know, someone must have drawn fan art of this guy's feet.

1306
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:02,250
What?

1307
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:05,690

1308
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:06,830
Speaking in front of my cigarettes.

You know, there's like...

1310
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:14,370
You know, there's like a website where like, it's like a directory of all the streamer feeds.

Oh, is this like cake where they sit on cakes?

1314
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:32,850
Literally in the game, you just pay people, usually girls, to fart on cakes and take a video.

1315
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:33,930
What the fuck?

1316
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:37,450

Hmm.

1328
01:29:56,230 --> 01:29:57,070
No, no, I'm curious.

1329
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:58,370
How did you find out about that?

1330
01:29:58,870 --> 01:29:59,250
What the fuck?

1331
01:29:59,490 --> 01:29:59,890
What am I?

1332
01:29:59,930 --> 01:29:59,990
What am I?

1333
01:30:00,070 --> 01:30:00,650
Get out, okay.

1334
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:01,230
Oh.

1335
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:04,210
We're alive, but I doubt we'll not get back to doing too much.

1336
01:30:04,670 --> 01:30:05,990
Troll, this is Delta.

1337
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:09,250
We've repaired the power lines, but there's a Brumac here.

1338
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:10,610
Please advise.

1339
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:11,070
Over.

1340
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:14,730
Sick my hips.

1341
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:16,970
We'll never know what Anya wants to say.

1342
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:18,330
Anya, do you read?

1343
01:30:18,410 --> 01:30:19,310
Oh, is that Jack?

1344
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:20,010
Oh, Jack.

1345
01:30:20,270 --> 01:30:20,830
Yeah, that's Jack.

1346
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:22,390
It's me, a cedar.

1347
01:30:24,070 --> 01:30:25,030
Ugh, I'm close.

1348
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:54,890
Looks like we're on our own and we need you know about the one where oh my did you see like the new the new Eagle baiting streams Where they white baiting there's like okay, so there's this new trend that I saw and like it showed up on my timeline And it's where like they chatters can pay to control little robot cars with cameras on them to drive around the girl Is that fucking crazy?

1349
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,410
Did you hear this?

1350
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:00,150
Business is business.

1351
01:31:01,050 --> 01:31:12,810
Yeah, there was a Twitch meta where like streamers would literally be like, oh, hey, if you pay X amount, you can access these cars with cameras attached to it.

1352
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:16,970
Someone's like, oh, that's like six months.

1353
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:18,110
How did you know that?

1354
01:31:18,210 --> 01:31:21,150
How did you know how long ago this Twitch meta was?

1355
01:31:22,730 --> 01:31:26,030
You seem very well versed in when it started.

1356
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,830
Oh my god.

1357
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:30,130
Business is business.

1358
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:32,230
I want to go left side.

1359
01:31:32,450 --> 01:31:32,910
Which way do I want to go?

1360
01:31:33,010 --> 01:31:33,750
You want to go left?

1361
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:34,570
Yeah, I want to go left.

1362
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:36,190
I'll check the main hall.

1363
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:37,630
Dom, head upstairs.

1364
01:31:40,950 --> 01:31:42,090
That's not good.

1365
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:45,350
I was just like, I was there at ground zero.

1366
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:47,010
This is not good.

1367
01:31:47,150 --> 01:31:48,130
Wait, I'm just by myself.

1368
01:31:48,150 --> 01:31:48,870
There's like two guys.

1369
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:51,930
There's like, there's a cedar.

1370
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,370
There's like two guys on a...

1371
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:54,210
I don't like that.

1372
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,210
Oh my god.

1375
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,470
I am trying my best to shoot at the turret guy for you.

1376
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:40,370
They just look at me one millisecond away after.

01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:47,890
There's another one.

1380
01:32:48,330 --> 01:32:49,570
There's another one?

1381
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,990
Yes, that's why I can't move, there's two of them.

1382
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:52,770
I don't need no.

1383
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:55,150
Okay, I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him.

1384
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:56,950
Oh, he's off the turret.

1385
01:32:57,290 --> 01:32:58,250
Yeah, he's off the turret.

1386
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,070
You go shoot him.

1387
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:03,130
All right, I'm moving forward to my area.

1388
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:03,610
Oh, wait.

1389
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:06,290
I have to just stay here.

1390
01:33:09,770 --> 01:33:12,310
Wait, there's a sniper over there.

1391
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,350
What the fuck is shooting me?

1392
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:18,950
The cedar's the problem, though.

1393
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:21,650
I'm trying to get the sniper.

1394
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:23,890
I'm trying to rotate.

1395
01:33:24,030 --> 01:33:25,230
My rotation is a bit awkward.

There has to be a back door.

1399
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:02,010
Let's split up.

1400
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:02,930

1401
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:03,930
Okay.

1402
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:07,530
I realized I was supposed to do something for you.

1403
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:09,570
I see.

1404
01:34:10,690 --> 01:34:11,210
That's...

1405
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:11,650
I see.

1406
01:34:11,710 --> 01:34:12,630
That's right.

1407
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:17,410
Okay.

1408
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:19,630

Don't worry.

01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:22,810
I got you.

1412
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:23,890
For real this time.

1413
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:26,210
Come on.

1414
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:28,490
Let's see where I'm throwing it.

1415
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:31,630
Yeah, I got one.

1416
01:34:32,070 --> 01:34:33,290
Oh, I got you.

1417
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:35,210
For real.

1418
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:38,870
Oh.

1419
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:42,290
I got, I don't, I actually don't know what happened.

1420
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:43,210
Yeah, exactly.

1421
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:45,430
It's the, it's the flying thing.

1422
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:46,550
I think, holy crap.

1423
01:34:46,790 --> 01:34:49,330
Like, I don't know what happened.

1424
01:34:49,850 --> 01:34:52,250
I actually just exploded.

1425
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:55,010
Yeah.

1426
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:57,550
That's what happened, I think.

1427
01:35:03,770 --> 01:35:05,750
I wish I knew what happened.

1428
01:35:06,370 --> 01:35:08,730
That would have been pretty interesting.

1429
01:35:16,170 --> 01:35:17,030
He's still alive.

1430
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:17,910
Yeah, you're off the sniper.

1431
01:35:18,810 --> 01:35:20,150
Yeah, I have three snipers.

1432
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:22,090
Yeah, there's like a lot of snipers here.

1433
01:35:23,190 --> 01:35:25,530
Like it's either I'm taking care of the sniper or the flying thing.

1434

01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:58,380
Wait, where's my shotgun?

1438
01:36:58,520 --> 01:36:58,980
There it is.

1439
01:36:59,980 --> 01:37:01,180
How do I get down now?

1440
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:03,140
Oh, what the?

1441
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,220
How the fuck do I get down?

1442
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,080
Hell.

1443
01:37:09,660 --> 01:37:10,880
We learn what a wall...

1444
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:12,920
V-tubers learn what walls are.

1445
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:14,500
As a TV.

1446
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:15,200
Never seen them.

1447
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:16,160
Never seen one.

1448
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,640
Yeah, we never seen them before.

1449
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,400
I've never seen one.

1450
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,000
I've never seen an actual law before.

1451
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:22,800
Wait, what?

1452
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,760
Where do I go now?

1453
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:28,320
I'm, like, stuck here.

1454
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:30,820
I'm trying to clear out the area here.

1455
01:37:30,940 --> 01:37:32,760
Oh, are we supposed to clear the area now?

1456
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:33,700
Okay, that makes sense.

1457
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:34,420
I don't know.

1458
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,180
There's a lot of people with a bow in front of me, and, uh...

1459
01:37:37,180 --> 01:37:38,140
Okay, that makes sense.

1460
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,140
I was like, am I supposed to help you?

1461
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:43,380
Like, there's legit a lot.

1462
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,900
I want to get on the turn, but at the same time, I am kind of scared.

1463
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,260
Oh, my God.

1464
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,040

Let's go!

1471
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:32,040
No, it's my turn and turn.

Yes, it is.

See, they're live!

1477
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:57,080
Why are they blind again?

1478
01:39:57,320 --> 01:39:58,560
Are they sun sensitive?

1479
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:00,940
I think, yeah, I think the lights are too bright.

1480
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:05,640

All right, let's see.

1484
01:40:45,190 --> 01:40:46,650
We're going to go this way, I'm pretty sure.

Okay, Canadian.

1517
01:43:53,250 --> 01:44:42,610
too much money for the spending they like they try to spend all them and uh they didn't spend all the money they just buy random shit so to make sure it doesn't the budget doesn't get cut yeah yeah it's just like that we gotta spend as much money as we can so our budget doesn't get cut so our budget is justified seven yeah exactly we had seven billion dollar excess so we had to spend it on the satellite all on satellites no communication satellite just just a straight straight who's fancy laser pointer it's a really cool fancy laser pointer though really cool yeah it's very cool oh that guy was tired he was like resting on the trash

1558
01:50:14,330 --> 01:50:19,350
I feel like revolver is stronger than sniper during those fights.

1559
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:21,530
I can't tell.

1560
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:22,670

1561
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:25,570
He's like, I headshot him, but he didn't fucking get to die.

1562
01:50:26,130 --> 01:50:26,770
That's so confused.

01:50:29,350 --> 01:50:30,110
There you go.

01:50:31,030 --> 01:50:31,770
I don't think you know.

1565
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:33,970
That's a good question.

1566
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:35,990
I headshot him with a sniper twice and then I did.

1567
01:50:36,270 --> 01:50:39,020

01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:53,890
Oh, my God.

1576
01:50:53,910 --> 01:50:55,010
We have to do booms again.

1577
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:56,990
Oh, it's these guys.

1578
01:50:57,050 --> 01:50:58,530
We have to do the shotgun guys again.

1579
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:02,150
What?

1580
01:51:03,270 --> 01:51:06,170
Yeah, I generally can't tell.

1581
01:51:06,270 --> 01:51:08,770
Like, what the fuck was that?

1582
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:16,410
Like, sniper reloads is just really slow.

1583
01:51:16,730 --> 01:51:18,910
Okay, I'm just...

1584
01:51:18,910 --> 01:51:20,030
Okay, he can't aim.

1585
01:51:20,150 --> 01:51:20,570
That's good.

1586
01:51:22,230 --> 01:51:24,630
Okay, he's not going my way, so I don't know.

1587
01:51:26,290 --> 01:51:27,110
Kill one.

1588
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:32,640
Boom.

1589
01:51:32,900 --> 01:51:33,920
I shot him in his butt.

1590
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:37,680
I shot him in his ass and won.

1591
01:51:39,240 --> 01:51:40,520
This is for freedom.

1592
01:51:41,600 --> 01:51:42,420
Let me hit my cigarette.

1593
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:43,580
All right.

1594
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:44,940
I triggered it.

1595
01:51:50,080 --> 01:51:52,820
Good thing you hit that cigarette.

1596
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:53,840
Yeah.

1597
01:51:55,160 --> 01:51:57,340
Oh, you're not dead with a single headshot.

1598
01:51:59,900 --> 01:52:01,780
Two headshots and they're still alive.

1599
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:02,500
That's what I'm saying.

1600
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,700
I think it's because they're wearing helmets.

1601
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,020
Three headshots, probably.

1602
01:52:07,420 --> 01:52:08,760
I'm pretty sure it's a helmet.

1603
01:52:11,600 --> 01:53:08,320
that came out of it so like it's hitting it is a bear's pushing I saw someone to our right is still there yeah he is I got him oh shit the shotgun is harder now isn't it it doesn't like what the happened did they scale yeah they scaled like I could have sworn shotgun was like three shots until we die yeah it just i think the chapter like at this chapter it just got harder this just goes from bad maybe they're older they're more experienced with the guns control we're at tim gad central energy copy that what's your status just moving we're in door kicking bro like seriously can't you look at their legs they gotta use it for something they worked hard for that they worked hard on those goddamn

Alright, he's...

1648
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:27,620
He has the high ground.

1649
01:56:31,220 --> 01:56:32,560
And now we can do it.

1650
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:33,720
Oh, the door's open.

1651
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:35,740
Where am I getting shot from?

1652
01:56:36,220 --> 01:56:37,280
Wait, where did you die?

1655
01:56:43,340 --> 01:56:44,620
Okay, that's what shot you.

1656
01:56:45,580 --> 01:56:47,300
No, I was shooting him.

1657
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:48,120
He was not shooting back.

1658
01:56:48,440 --> 01:56:49,420
There's so much ammo over there.

1659
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:50,460
You need ammo?

1660
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:52,280
Yes, I knew.

1661
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,880
Literally right here.

1662
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:59,070
What the fuck is shooting us?

1663
01:56:59,110 --> 01:57:00,070
Is this a sniper right here?

1664
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:02,330
I fucking accidentally picked up the sniper again.

1665
01:57:02,810 --> 01:57:03,330
Oh, my God.

1666
01:57:03,410 --> 01:57:04,750
Where did the sniper come from?

1667
01:57:05,050 --> 01:57:05,510
Oh, it's here.

1668
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:05,970
Okay.

1669
01:57:06,290 --> 01:57:08,130
I got my gun back.

1670
01:57:08,330 --> 01:57:09,070
I'm happy now.

1671
01:57:10,730 --> 01:57:11,770
I'll wait for you downstairs.

1672
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:16,010
I think they're coming.

1673
01:57:17,430 --> 01:57:18,650
It's just, we gotta go through the door.

1674
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:21,490
Nice.

1675
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:22,250
Stand by.

1676
01:57:22,350 --> 01:57:23,570
I'm gonna open a door for you.

1677
01:57:23,750 --> 01:57:24,010
Bye.

1678
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:25,330
Open the door for us.

1679
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:26,550
There's one last panel in that room.

1680
01:57:26,830 --> 01:57:27,710
Transfer it to me.

1681
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:31,130
Holy shit, this goddamn bullet sponge.

1682
01:57:33,870 --> 01:57:34,890
Oh my god.

1683
01:57:34,950 --> 01:57:35,410
You dead yet?

1684
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:37,770
No, I'm still alive.

1685
01:57:40,490 --> 01:57:40,890
Nice.

1686
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:43,410
I think we gotta do this here.

1687
01:57:45,850 --> 01:57:47,410
I hear more footsteps.

1688
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:48,270
Me too.

1689
01:57:48,410 --> 01:57:50,310
I hear like our guys shooting something.

1690
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:52,330
Like they're across the room.

1691
01:57:53,730 --> 01:57:55,050
Oh, it's, oh, there's nays.

1692
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:55,810
Oh, god, nays.

1693
01:57:55,850 --> 01:57:56,450
I have zero.

1694
01:57:58,330 --> 01:57:58,790
I have nays.

1695
01:57:58,890 --> 01:57:59,490
I have two.

1696
01:57:59,690 --> 01:58:00,470
Are you sniping?

1697
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:01,310

1698
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:02,350
No, no.

1699
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:03,070
That's not me.

1700
01:58:03,130 --> 01:58:03,950
That's what I'm saying.

1701
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:06,830
Who's sniping on our team?

1702
01:58:07,010 --> 01:58:08,830
I think that's cool.

1703
01:58:10,870 --> 01:58:13,490
Like someone is sniping for 20 years.

1704
01:58:15,370 --> 01:58:15,650
Wait.

1705
01:58:16,230 --> 01:58:17,250

Goodbye.

1714
01:59:30,710 --> 01:59:31,630

1715
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:32,390
I need Rez.

1716
01:59:33,510 --> 01:59:34,070
Rez!

1717
01:59:34,430 --> 01:59:35,490
Target those arm guns.

1718
01:59:36,070 --> 01:59:36,790
Oh, arm guns.

1719
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:38,850
Rez, mercy!

1720
01:59:39,950 --> 01:59:40,490
Okay, nice.

1721
01:59:42,170 --> 01:59:44,170
A guy is BTs.

1722
01:59:47,430 --> 01:59:48,970
I'm shooting the arm guns.

1723
01:59:50,110 --> 01:59:51,130
I'm shooting the right arm.

1724
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:54,310
I'm trying to get covered, but there's no cover here.

1725
01:59:56,270 --> 01:59:57,250
That's why he's chasing you.

1726
01:59:58,690 --> 01:59:59,430
I'm shooting it right now.

1727
01:59:59,590 --> 02:00:00,050
I'm shooting the right.

1728
02:00:01,070 --> 02:00:01,370
Okay.

1729
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:02,050
It's destroyed.

1730
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:02,630
It's destroyed.

1731
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:07,130
Oh, he's not looking at me so I can't shoot the right.

1732
02:00:08,690 --> 02:00:09,750
I'll shoot his feet.

1733
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:12,010
Oh, God.

1734
02:00:12,690 --> 02:00:14,810
I literally tried to run to the...

1735
02:00:14,810 --> 02:00:15,410
So he...

1736
02:00:15,410 --> 02:00:17,090
Oh, kill the driver.

1737
02:00:18,450 --> 02:00:19,310
There's a driver.

1738
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:21,170
I don't have an angle.

1739
02:00:21,730 --> 02:00:23,650
There's a dude on top of it.

1740
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:27,790
I mean, I can shoot a link still.

1741
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:32,150
There you go.

1742
02:00:32,270 --> 02:00:32,550
There you go.

1743
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:33,010
It's crouching.

1744
02:00:33,090 --> 02:00:33,690
He's crouching.

1745
02:00:33,990 --> 02:00:34,390
He's limping.

1746
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:36,950
He's limping.

1747
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:37,930
Come, come, come, come, come.

1748
02:00:38,050 --> 02:00:38,710
I got his feet.

1749
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:39,850
Kill him.

1750
02:00:39,850 --> 02:00:40,170
Boom.

1751
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:40,750
Nice.

Okay, let's roast this thing.

1754
02:00:48,670 --> 02:00:48,910
Where?

1755
02:00:49,030 --> 02:00:49,670
Over there.

1756
02:00:49,850 --> 02:01:00,770

That don't make sense.

1765
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,700
They just appear out of thin air.

1766
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,540
Where are you looking at?

1767
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:29,300

Where is up?

1773
02:02:36,980 --> 02:02:40,960
I literally can't even see them on my angle.

02:02:42,940 --> 02:02:44,180
I'm really a walk boy.

1775
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:45,200

it's leaking smoke.

1819
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:44,840
Yeah, it's leaking smoke.

1820
02:05:45,240 --> 02:05:47,640
So I should be able to blow up this entire train.

1821

Bow man, bow man, bow man to the left.

1825
02:05:53,240 --> 02:05:55,300
If he shoots from behind us, it activates too.

Which I don't know.

Koopler release.

02:07:52,220 --> 02:07:54,160
Oh, did we fuck up by going back here?

1863
02:07:55,320 --> 02:07:55,960
Oh, it's here.

1864
02:07:56,080 --> 02:07:59,180
Oh, we need to release the switch when he's on the car.

1865
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:00,200
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1866
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,100
Here, here, here.

1867
02:08:01,100 --> 02:08:02,000
I gotta get her over here.

1868
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:02,400
Like he charges.

1869
02:08:04,620 --> 02:08:05,040
Go away.

1870
02:08:05,080 --> 02:08:05,540
We'll just shoot her.

1871
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:06,160
Get the fuck over here, man.

1872
02:08:06,280 --> 02:08:07,000
We'll get over here.

1873
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:08,180
We want Stoostoosto?

1874
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:13,380
Come on.

1875
02:08:13,380 --> 02:08:14,660
Come on.

1876
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:16,640
Let's lead him into the further back.

1877
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:18,440
Okay.

1878
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,580
Just a safe, you know.

1879
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,240
Go, go, go, present, present,

1880
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,280
I exploded.

1881
02:08:34,180 --> 02:08:34,360
What?

1882
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:38,300
Why did I explode?

1883
02:08:38,620 --> 02:08:40,360
What the fuck that noise?

1884
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,340
Now I'm player one.

1885
02:08:45,720 --> 02:08:48,520
To be fair, I thought it would give us a cut.

1886
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:49,720
You get like a cutscene bump.

1887
02:08:49,780 --> 02:08:50,560
That's what I thought.

1888
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:52,120
That's what I thought there was going to be.

1889
02:08:52,200 --> 02:08:53,440
Maybe there's going to be a cutscene.

1890
02:08:53,800 --> 02:08:55,220
I thought you would get a cutscene bump.

1891
02:08:55,760 --> 02:08:57,520
Where you just jump over.

1892
02:08:57,780 --> 02:09:00,300
I didn't think you'd actually die.

1893
02:09:03,220 --> 02:09:03,940
I'd explode.

1894
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:05,640
You actually exploded.

1895
02:09:06,660 --> 02:09:07,380
That's crazy.

1896
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,080
Like how to like how to fuck.

1897
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:09,700
Is she going to run?

1898
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:10,860
Oh, okay.

1899
02:09:10,900 --> 02:09:11,860
She doesn't run through that.

1900
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:12,680
She doesn't know how.

1901
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,480
Okay, she's running.

1902
02:09:16,640 --> 02:09:17,180
Okay, okay.

1903
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:18,000
I'm heading over.

1904
02:09:18,120 --> 02:09:18,500
I'm heading over.

1905
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:19,760
I'm heading over.

1906
02:09:19,940 --> 02:09:22,180
You better come over or you're gonna... Hold on.

1907
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:22,640
Hold on.

1908
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:22,800
Hold on.

1909
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:25,100
I'll lure her to the further back.

1910
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:26,360
You better come over.

1911
02:09:26,580 --> 02:09:27,440

You, I can't press a button.

02:16:37,590 --> 02:16:41,390
It won't let me open that door because you're dead.

2031
02:16:43,230 --> 02:16:44,590
That's not fair.

2032
02:16:45,730 --> 02:16:47,230
It's not fair.

2033
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:49,510
We'll pick you up as soon as we plant the data.

2034
02:16:50,150 --> 02:16:51,550
Whoa, yeah, baby.

2035

02:16:55,090 --> 02:16:55,930
for this part.

2038
02:16:58,570 --> 02:16:58,950
Player one.

2039
02:16:59,130 --> 02:17:00,710
Player two can't be a hero.

2040
02:17:01,530 --> 02:17:02,470
That's messed up.

2041
02:17:03,630 --> 02:17:05,810
Player two should be allowed to be a hero.

2042
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:08,370
We have to do.

2043
02:17:11,330 --> 02:17:12,810
Oh my god.

2044
02:17:14,170 --> 02:17:15,050

02:17:15,850 --> 02:17:16,050
Button.

2046
02:17:16,710 --> 02:17:18,550
Oh my god, this is actually not fair.

2047
02:17:19,170 --> 02:17:21,330
I can't believe you got button privileges.

2048
02:17:23,610 --> 02:17:23,970
What?

2049
02:17:24,450 --> 02:17:25,030
Open!

2050
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:29,130
How many buttons do I need to press?

2051
02:17:30,190 --> 02:17:31,010
I'm just a sidekick.

2052
02:17:31,010 --> 02:17:32,650
I'm just a sidekick.

2053
02:17:33,070 --> 02:17:35,150
Never the hero.

2054
02:17:36,410 --> 02:17:40,990
Dom is always the hero in my book.

2055
02:17:42,970 --> 02:17:44,250
Never the hero.

2056
02:17:45,730 --> 02:17:47,190
I can't quit you, Dom.

2057
02:17:47,530 --> 02:17:48,070
Let's do this.

2058
02:17:49,090 --> 02:17:50,010
Can't quit you, Dom.

2059
02:17:52,590 --> 02:17:54,030

He's a gop.

2069
02:18:15,500 --> 02:18:16,500
He's a gop guy.

2070
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:21,720
You're not allowed to look at the sun.

2071
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:23,900
Wait, how do we kill him?

2072
02:18:24,080 --> 02:18:24,760

Getting on a chain gun.

It's the crows.

02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:17,050
Okay, apparently it takes a lot less damage when he has the crows on him.

2122

That's fine.

2123
02:23:18,830 --> 02:23:21,770
That's why we can shoot him now.

2124
02:23:22,610 --> 02:23:23,630

02:24:24,830 --> 02:24:25,630
You're in front of him.

2163
02:24:26,110 --> 02:24:27,050
Maybe we can aggro.

2164
02:24:28,750 --> 02:24:29,630

Oh, you're grabbing the bomb or the data.

2168
02:25:48,150 --> 02:25:48,950
Uh-oh!

2169
02:25:49,330 --> 02:25:50,790
The bridge is gone!

2170
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:54,850
Wait, then why try to stop us if they know the bridge is gone?

2171
02:26:04,930 --> 02:26:05,330
Nice!

2172
02:26:14,470 --> 02:26:19,090
And we get to eat- we get free fish for years because all the fish will be dead.

2173
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:24,040
Boom.

2174
02:26:27,440 --> 02:26:27,680
Oh.

2175
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:28,900
Boom.

2176
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:30,780
Oh shit.

2177
02:26:34,900 --> 02:26:36,940
Oh, there's a lot of them.

2178
02:26:37,240 --> 02:26:38,500
Yeah, that's a lot of baby.

2179
02:26:38,840 --> 02:26:39,380
Holy crap.

2180
02:26:43,030 --> 02:26:44,410
I love eating fish.

2181
02:26:44,630 --> 02:26:45,650
That's radioactive.

2182
02:26:48,050 --> 02:26:50,930
That's polluted by weapons of mass destruction.

2183
02:26:57,110 --> 02:26:58,610
We actually finished it.

2184
02:26:58,910 --> 02:27:00,210
Oh my god, that was the end?

2185
02:27:00,390 --> 02:27:01,730
I thought there were six chapters.

2186
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:06,470
I thought they were like, boys, we have to kill someone else.

2187
02:27:08,570 --> 02:27:09,010
Who knows?

2188
02:27:09,430 --> 02:27:14,270
I mean, I got an achievement, complete the all acts.

2189
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:17,270
Job done.

2190
02:27:17,530 --> 02:27:21,150
But you have my word that we will rise again.

2191
02:27:23,210 --> 02:27:24,930
Yay, we did it!

2192
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:26,770
There, but the queen is still alive.

2193
02:27:27,750 --> 02:28:28,370

2194
02:28:29,110 --> 02:28:29,850
That's fun.

2195
02:28:30,690 --> 02:28:35,310
I hope one day they'll actually, they'll actually remaster Gears of War 2.

2196
02:28:35,770 --> 02:28:37,950
Alright, I'm gonna grab him.

2197
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:39,450
Grab him.

2198
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:47,020
Boom.

2199
02:28:52,870 --> 02:28:55,070
But Gears 2 is not on PC yet, right?

2200
02:28:55,270 --> 02:28:56,910
He has been grabbed.

2201
02:28:57,350 --> 02:28:58,730
He's good right now.

2202
02:28:59,570 --> 02:28:59,710
Right.

2203
02:28:59,970 --> 02:29:00,390
Oh.

2204
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:05,940
That's fun.

2205
02:29:06,260 --> 02:29:06,760
I don't need time.

2206
02:29:06,760 --> 02:29:08,360
So wait, are they gonna...

2207
02:29:08,380 --> 02:29:11,660
Make two, three, four, five.

2208
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:17,560
I mean, I don't know, because all they do is just remaster one, like, four times.

2209
02:29:19,500 --> 02:29:20,580
Yeah, sounds about right.

2210
02:29:20,580 --> 02:29:21,280
Sounds about right.

2211
02:29:21,860 --> 02:29:23,380
I don't know why they don't do it, though.

2212
02:29:24,920 --> 02:29:25,600
Maybe they lost.

2213
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:32,300
Maybe it's like, what was that game where, like, they lost the files for the game so they could never remaster it?

2214
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:35,380
There was like, does anyone remember what game that was?

2215
02:29:36,700 --> 02:29:37,920
Oh my God, that's the cold trade.

2216
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,180
Is this copyrighted?

2217
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:41,700
It's fine.

2218
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:43,360
I don't really care.

2219
02:29:43,360 --> 02:29:45,040
Can I...

2220
02:29:45,040 --> 02:29:47,700
Wait, it's just, like, a little higher revenue.

2221
02:29:49,420 --> 02:29:52,180
I need all the money I can get, man.

2222
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,800
In this economy.

2223
02:29:55,100 --> 02:29:57,900
It's almost Doggy's Dog World.

2224
02:29:58,240 --> 02:29:58,940
That's true.

2225
02:29:59,840 --> 02:30:00,440
Oh.

2226
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:02,400
Destiny 2?

2227
02:30:03,380 --> 02:30:04,600
Oh, is it Destiny?

2228
02:30:04,840 --> 02:30:05,580
They had, like...

2229
02:30:05,580 --> 02:30:07,280
Oh, so they couldn't do anything to the game.

2230
02:30:07,340 --> 02:30:08,360
They couldn't remaster it.

2231
02:30:08,380 --> 02:30:52,900
because they they lost the game they lost like the actual project files that's i know the same for some movies too they can't remaster like some animated movies or like not anime some 3d movies because they lost the project files and stuff yeah they i lost their they accidentally deleted the game files shit happens right yeah so they can't they couldn't like do anything about it That's why we don't get Gears of War 2 and 3 Because they don't want to admit it They don't want to admit they lost the files Totally That's why they remastered 1 like 4 times This is the 4th time,

2232
02:30:52,940 --> 02:30:53,160
right?

2233
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:54,700
That they remastered it?

2234
02:30:55,500 --> 02:30:56,020
Probably?

2235
02:30:56,640 --> 02:31:13,380
I don't remember how many times they've done it I remember seeing it like Xbox One I know it's been like Xbox One And like 3rd time This is the 3rd time they've done it And they always forget to, not forget, they always like make sure to not include two and three.

2236
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:15,080
Right?

2237
02:31:15,580 --> 02:31:15,940
Dad.

2238
02:31:16,200 --> 02:31:17,940
They just do it.

2239
02:31:18,240 --> 02:31:22,080
They just, what do you mean you lost the files?

2240
02:31:22,220 --> 02:31:23,080
Just find them.

2241
02:31:24,680 --> 02:31:26,800
Yeah, I legit just downloaded it.

2242
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:28,660
I downloaded it.

2243
02:31:28,880 --> 02:31:30,240
How you, how you lost the file?

2244
02:31:30,400 --> 02:31:30,960
I downloaded the game.

2245
02:31:30,960 --> 02:31:31,420
Just Google it.

2246
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,560
Just Google the files.

2247
02:31:33,680 --> 02:31:34,960
Somewhere, somewhere in pirate base.

2248
02:31:35,440 --> 02:31:36,900
Oh my god.

2249
02:31:39,040 --> 02:32:07,380
You know how they're like always make backups and they never do they don't I don't think a lot of people do backups man I don't Wow If anything happens to my PC Oh god Oh god It's the fun of it the gavel.

2250
02:32:07,380 --> 02:32:09,280
It's the thrill of it, you mean, for fucks it.

2251
02:32:09,300 --> 02:32:10,700
It's the thrill, you know?

2252
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:13,720
I like playing close with fire, you know?

2253
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,560
I want to see how high I can fly to the sun.

2254
02:32:17,020 --> 02:32:18,720
I'm actually concerned now.

2255
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:20,640
It's okay.

2256
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:21,460
It's okay.

2257
02:32:21,500 --> 02:32:27,420
I will never lose my skin suit because Celia has all the files so I could just because I know because she backs up her.

2258
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:32,420
I have responsible people that back up their work and I'm not one of them.

2259
02:32:34,140 --> 02:33:07,780
You you pay to be lazy you know how they're like when you're like um you know how like um uh when you get your PC like fixed or something or like you want to change something or PC they're like you should back up your files just in case I took my PC to the shop a lot of times and I think I've only I've only done that once I don't I've only done it once.

2260
02:33:08,620 --> 02:33:13,820
Honestly, I find that nice that they actually suggest you to back up some stuff.

2261
02:33:14,860 --> 02:33:23,200
Because some scummy PC shop here will legit just like reinstall everything without your consent.

2262
02:33:23,360 --> 02:33:23,880
Wait, really?

2263
02:33:23,980 --> 02:33:25,420
I think like that's a lawsuit.

2264
02:33:26,480 --> 02:33:28,180
Oh, what's that here?

2265
02:33:28,300 --> 02:33:29,300
What's a lawsuit?

2266
02:33:29,720 --> 02:33:31,480
You know, that's like without your consent, you know.

2267
02:33:31,660 --> 02:33:32,460
You gotta have consent.

2268
02:33:32,660 --> 02:33:33,880
Yeah, that's crazy.

2269
02:33:36,000 --> 02:34:35,440
man yeah one day I'll learn how to back stuff up one day you just back up yeah one day I'll learn I feel like I feel like I I think like all I need is just like what I just need like an S like an external hard drive right okay to be fair I do have an external hard drive but they have like it has like the last time I've like I said the last time I've like saved like in point five I didn't back up I just like saved like important files in there was like I think like two years ago that's the last time very important yeah very important to forget about it me couldn't be me I had fun I had fun playing gears of war that was a good time good time tangent it was nice playing with you again hopefully they made the second game for real though I hope so I've God.

2270
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:38,200
God damn me.

2271
02:34:38,320 --> 02:34:43,980
I never like, like I said, I never grew up with, like, I only watched my dad play Gears of War, so I don't even really know the plot of the game.

2272
02:34:44,220 --> 02:34:48,440
I remember playing the first one, but then I never bothered to continue it, so I wouldn't know what to expect.

2273
02:34:50,280 --> 02:34:55,360
Yeah, like, I knew about the, like, I just knew, like, I just knew they were called Locus, but that was it.

2274
02:34:55,640 --> 02:34:58,000
But I didn't really know the general plot of the game.

2275
02:34:58,160 --> 02:34:59,920
All it matters, I want to play Dawn.

2276
02:34:59,940 --> 02:35:01,220
I love the chainsaw gun.

2277
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:02,660
I want to play Dawn.

2278
02:35:04,660 --> 02:35:36,180
never be dumb i want to be never be him i want to be dominic santiago why do you want to be dominic so badly he's so cool how is he cool he's like he seems like a little bitch also is there an after credit scene or like are we like watching i don't know i i skipped the fucking wait you skipped the credits i said i i watched i mean i went through like It's probably 70% of,

2279
02:35:36,200 --> 02:35:36,700
yeah, I don't know.

2280
02:35:37,340 --> 02:35:39,780
I don't know if it's repeating.

2281
02:35:40,360 --> 02:35:42,300
Yeah, I thought it was like...

2282
02:35:42,300 --> 02:35:47,100
The music stopped, and then I feel like I saw the Coalition logo at the first time.

2283
02:35:47,300 --> 02:35:48,200
So I'm like, you know what?

2284
02:35:48,400 --> 02:35:49,100
Maybe it's done.

2285
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:51,140
Maybe it's done.

2286
02:35:51,360 --> 02:35:53,460
You're not allowed to diss or avoid...

2287
02:35:53,460 --> 02:35:54,400
Why is this...

2288
02:35:54,400 --> 02:35:56,180
Okay, okay, what's up with Don?

2289
02:35:56,440 --> 02:35:57,920
Okay, what makes Dom...

2290
02:35:57,920 --> 02:35:58,300
Dom?

2291
02:35:59,320 --> 02:36:00,440
What makes him...

2292
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:01,520
What makes him...

2293
02:36:02,360 --> 02:36:04,640
I can't say much, but we've got to play two.

2294
02:36:04,660 --> 02:36:31,620
and three what has he done to earn your respect guys because like oh because like right now marcus seems a lot cooler you wouldn't get it you wouldn't get it you gotta be there at two and three he's a man's man he's a he's all right i guess i guess we'll find out in like five years when They released the Gears Award,

2295
02:36:31,800 --> 02:36:32,180
too.

2296
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,980
You're going to have to play two and three.

2297
02:36:34,220 --> 02:36:35,080
You're going to like Dom.

2298
02:36:35,080 --> 02:36:36,420
I can't wait.

2299
02:36:36,500 --> 02:36:40,020
I can't wait for them to release two and five years and three and ten.

2300
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:43,640
And then we'll finally find out what's up with Dom.

2301
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,260
Has the credits been going?

2302
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:48,500
Chat, has the credits been?

2303
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:50,840
I think it looped, dude.

2304
02:36:51,080 --> 02:36:51,420
It didn't loop?

2305
02:36:52,200 --> 02:36:52,900
I can't tell.

2306
02:36:53,860 --> 02:36:56,620
Because, like, I saw the Coalition logo again.

2307
02:36:56,820 --> 02:36:57,500
And I was like, oh.

2308
02:36:58,060 --> 02:36:58,800
Is it looping?

2309
02:36:58,800 --> 02:36:59,240
Is it looping?

2310
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:20,660
i don't know i can't tell i don't know if there's an after okay it's the third loop okay how the fuck how okay there you go i thought there was an after credit scene i've been like waiting for that i it's like the old time ages after credits weren't exactly popular like three times before I noticed.

2311
02:37:20,980 --> 02:37:23,180
I was just like, I don't know.

2312
02:37:24,500 --> 02:37:25,860
Oh, GG's tension.

2313
02:37:27,360 --> 02:37:27,760
GG's.
