1
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,970
Hello, everybody!

2
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,150
Hello, hello!

3
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,130
I'm back today.

4
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,930
It's almost the end of October, but that means...

5
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,730
I can fit one more spooky game into the month.

6
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,890
So today, we're gonna be playing...

7
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,190
Finding... Sorry, I almost legitimately forgot the game.

8
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,630
I was like, what the fuck is the game called?

9
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,930
I had to look at my...

10
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,870
I had to look at the title of my stream!

11
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,010
I was like... It was like something Frankie.

12
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,630
Finding Frankie!

13
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,030
Yes!

14
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,590
Okay, so...

15
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,250
It is the next...

16
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,010
It is another mascot horror game.

17
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,410
Because apparently, that's all we do these days.

18
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,510
Like, it's either rebooting old...

19
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:31,430
Rebooting or remastering classic horror games.

20
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,550
Or the mascot horror genre.

21
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:40,390
So, Finding Frankie is another mascot horror game.

22
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,490
But the twist is that we are parkouring.

23
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,210
That's the twist.

24
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,770
It's basically like...

25
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,570
What if Fall Guys...

26
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,810
But it's scary.

27
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,010
So, that's the whole game.

28
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,730
It's scary parkour.

29
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,490
Horror Fall Guys.

30
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,610
Apparently, it's also...

31
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:13,370
It's also like a mascot horror genre.

32
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,730
So, that's also like the other twist in the mascot horror genre.

33
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:22,270
Look, not every game could be Garden of Bon Bon, guys.

34
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,050
Not every game can be just as good as Garden of Bon Bon.

35
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,250
The fucking masterpiece.

36
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,010
With their 4 billion triangles.

37
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:37,130
Doctor, thank you for the magenta soup.

38
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,570
Thank you, thank you.

39
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,930
Sympathy Raptor, will you...

40
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,250
Oh, wait.

41
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,310
Is this a marriage proposal?

42
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,750
No, don't marry that guy.

43
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,740
No, not him.

44
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,680
Anyway, thank you for the magenta soup.

45
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,700
Thank you, thank you.

46
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,120
Poor...

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,500
Don't keep...

48
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,680
No, you guys are supposed to pay attention to me.

49
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:13,220
Marriage proposal in my chat?

50
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,940
Anyway, I'm joking, I'm joking.

51
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:16,780
Okay, what are you saying?

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,160
Sympathy Raptor, will you marry Doctor Genzo?

53
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,040
You know, there's no...

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,160
No pressure, no pressure.

55
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,240
Are you even in my chat?

56
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,300
Oh, it would be so awkward if you're not even watching.

57
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,060
That would be...

58
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,240
Oh, but Doki, don't make...

59
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,140
Wait, you're right.

60
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,080
Alright, I'll only allow this marriage proposal if you name the child after me.

61
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,860
That's so fucked up, Doki.

62
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,500
Like, that child's gonna get bullied for the rest of their life.

63
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,780
Look, look, it's like those parents that named their kid after Naruto.

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,040
I'll only allow this marriage proposal to go through if you name your child after me.

65
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:58,960
That's all.

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,060
I could be a middle name, guys.

67
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,940
Like, I'm willing to compromise and even let you, like, give it as, like, a middle name.

68
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:07,600
That's it.

69
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,740
That's, like, the compromise I'm willing to take.

70
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,380
Like, it has to be a legal name.

71
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,480
It has to be a full legal name.

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,880
And then, like, I wanna see that person's birth certificate in my tags later.

73
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,160
Dox your baby now, right after.

74
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,980
What do you mean?

75
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,980
Doki can be a fucking middle name.

76
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,160
It's genderless.

77
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,580
It does not have male or female gender to it.

78
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:42,180
It's, like, such a gender-neutral fucking name.

79
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,260
What are you talking about?

80
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,680
Yes, I can make these demands.

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,940
It's literally my...

82
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,100
What do you mean, I can't make these demands?

83
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,840
It's my channel.

84
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,300
If you wanna do a marriage proposal on my channel, you gotta name...

85
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,980
I'm, like, Rumpelstiltskin.

86
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,500
Instead of giving me, like, your firstborn child, you have to name your child after me.

87
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,920
Anyway, where was I?

88
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,560
Oh, my gosh.

89
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,740
Oh, yeah, I was talking about the game.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,340
Anyway, life update.

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,820
So, okay, I have a lot of life updates, actually.

92
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,240
So, I bought a kettle.

93
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,080
You know, we bought it together, chat.

94
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,380
We bought the kettle together.

95
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,800
But the thing is, oh, my God.

96
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,360
It's the same kettle I saw at the close, like, local drug mart.

97
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,920
Okay, like, I know that sounds fucking weird.

98
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,060
But, like, if you guys don't know what, like, London Drugs is, that...

99
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,400
It's, like, that's what we call, like, those, like...

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,580
Like, those, you know, those marketplaces.

101
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,960
Like, those, like, you know, miniature marketplaces in Canada.

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,760
So, like, you know, it has everything.

103
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,600
It has everything, yeah.

104
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
It has... It's not, like...

105
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,900
It has, like, appliances.

106
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,040
Yeah, it's, like, a pharmacy.

107
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,960
But, like, it has everything.

108
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,240
It's not just for medicine.

109
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,640
It has, like, appliances, kitchen appliances.

110
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,480
Um...

111
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,480
CVS, yes, yes!

112
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,380
It's, like, Walgreens slash CVS in Canada.

113
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,340
Anyway, never knew Canada was chill like that.

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,000
I was so... I was, like, I was so fucking mad.

115
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,940
Because, like, you know, I ordered it off of Amazon.

116
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:41,300
But, like, it was literally the same kettle I saw at my local, like, I guess, pharmacy.

117
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,640
I don't know!

118
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,520
I don't know what it's called in American.

119
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,240
In American.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,960
And, like, um...

121
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,500
Anyway, so, like, uh...

122
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,720
And it was, like, the same one I saw there.

123
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,080
But it was, like, $30 cheaper.

124
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,900
Because it was on sale.

125
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,820
So, I was, like, are you fucking...

126
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,040
I was, like, I could have just...

127
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,020
I was literally there.

128
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,660
And I was, like, no, I'm just gonna go Amazon it.

129
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,920
It might be, like...

130
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360
They might have a better version.

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,880
And, like, it could be cheaper.

132
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,100
But it was literally the same one.

133
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,140
I was looking at that box, too.

134
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,840
Before I decided to, like, buy it on Amazon.

135
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,040
Like, I was looking at the same box.

136
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,600
I was debating.

137
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,880
I was, like, oh, do I want to carry this all the way home?

138
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,780
Like, it is, like, pretty far.

139
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,220
But I was, like, oh, but it is light.

140
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,840
And I was, like, debating it for the longest fucking time.

141
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,780
And then I was, like, no more order on Amazon.

142
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,580
Clearly, like, they have better brands.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
And it could be cheaper.

144
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,360
And then...

145
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,880
I could have got it 30...

146
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,260
Oh, my God.

147
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,540
I feel, like, such an adult now.

148
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,980
I'm, like, thinking about, like, oh, my God.

149
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,320
I could have got it $30 cheaper.

150
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,800
I say as I pay $1,000 for a commission.

151
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,700
Like...

152
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,810
I'm just, like, oh, my God.

153
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,590
I could have spent 30...

154
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,150
I could have spent $20 on this kettle instead of $50.

155
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,950
I say as I go on PayPal and do...

156
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,350
Pay for this no budget commission right now.

157
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:21,190
But, yeah.

158
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,970
But, anyway, I was really happy.

159
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,110
I was really happy I finally got a kettle.

160
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,870
Because that meant I can finally make my spicy noodles.

161
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,470
You know, the Buldak.

162
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,310
Samyang Buldak noodles.

163
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:33,830
I was so excited.

164
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,830
Because, like, I even went...

165
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,270
Because I've been getting those, like...

166
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,490
I've been missing the spicy noodles for a long time.

167
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,990
I usually call it spicy nudes.

168
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,570
But then, like, I realized context-wise I shouldn't say that on stream.

169
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,830
So, I'm just gonna call...

170
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,550
I usually be, like, man...

171
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,730
Like, to my friends, I'd be, like, I can't wait to get some spicy nudes.

172
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,670
But I was, like, I shouldn't say that to you guys.

173
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,210
Anyway.

174
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,870
Anyway, so I was, like, super excited.

175
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,090
Because I was, like, I haven't had them in a long time.

176
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,450
Because, you know, I didn't have a fucking kettle.

177
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,430
So, I also didn't have, like, pots or, like...

178
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,690
I didn't have any pots or, like, plates.

179
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:24,090
Or, like, bowls or anything.

180
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,350
Like, I only have paper plates and wooden utensils.

181
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,110
Like, I don't even have chopsticks or anything.

182
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:30,970
So, anyway.

183
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,670
I was super excited.

184
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,910
So, I was looking at, like, you know, Uber Eats to be, like...

185
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,810
Because I wanted to buy, like, the cup noodle version.

186
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:45,610
I wanted to buy the cup noodle version of, like, Samyang Buldak noodles.

187
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,350
So, they're, like, Korean spicy noodles.

188
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,010
And, like, you know, the one with the chicken on it.

189
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,730
And so, I was, like, trying to Uber Eat it.

190
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,630
Because, like, the supermarkets that sell them are, like, really far away.

191
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,490
So, I was, like, I'm just gonna Uber Eats.

192
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,310
So, but they only had, like...

193
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:05,570
The thing is, they don't have the cup noodle version.

194
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,630
They have the package version.

195
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,010
So...

196
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,310
I was, like...

197
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,510
Fuck.

198
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,750
I don't wanna buy pots.

199
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:17,550
You know.

200
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:24,110
I didn't wanna buy pots and pans and a bowl just for that.

201
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,250
Because, like, you know, I'm, like, living the fucking bachelor life here.

202
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,010
I'm literally, like...

203
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,530
I'm literally living, like, with, like, no utensils.

204
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,890
No utensils.

205
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:44,190
No...

206
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,150
No bowls.

207
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,070
No pots.

208
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:47,830
No pans.

209
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,690
No kitchen supplies.

210
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,410
Like, it's just a microwave and a kettle.

211
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:58,050
I do have, like, an oven and, like, you know, an oven and, like, what's the top part called?

212
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,470
The top part of the oven where you boil water.

213
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:07,450
Fuck!

214
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,790
Stove!

215
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,890
I have a stove.

216
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,650
Look, guys.

217
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,590
It's been a while.

218
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:16,250
I have a stove.

219
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,590
I have an oven.

220
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:18,570
I just don't use it.

221
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:19,330
I have a dishwasher.

222
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:25,630
I just don't use it because I don't have any of the things that require me to use it.

223
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,410
So...

224
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,270
So I was like, oh, man, I want to buy, like, a cup noodle of the Samyang Buldak noodles.

225
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,310
So I was like, there's, like, a local convenience store nearby.

226
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,750
So I went down there.

227
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,210
But then they also don't have the cup noodle version.

228
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:44,730
Because I was like, oh, none of the Uber Eats places have them.

229
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:52,090
Like, they have it, but it doesn't have the specific flavor that I want, which is carbonara.

230
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:56,070
I love the carbonara Buldak flavor the most.

231
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,450
And I was, like, craving for that.

232
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,290
Because I was like, kettle!

233
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,190
Yeah!

234
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,710
So, the convenience store...

235
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,090
It's the pink one.

236
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,530
Actually had them.

237
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,280
But it was...

238
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:15,990
I'm using my very first Super Chat to beg you to please buy dinnerware.

239
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:19,970
Noah, thank you for your very first Super Chat.

240
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,390
Thank you.

241
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:27,930
But, like, if I have plates and bowls, that requires me to wash them.

242
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,490
If I finish eating it, I can throw it in the trash can.

243
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:35,590
I can throw it into compost because it's made of paper.

244
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,570
It can be recycled.

245
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,690
Thank you for the Super Chat.

246
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,350
Thank you.

247
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,050
Thank you.

248
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,910
Next scene.

249
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:46,730
Thank you for the Super Chat.

250
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,110
Thank you.

251
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,410
Thank you.

252
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,510
You can buy Buldak noodles online.

253
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,390
Thank you for the Super Chat.

254
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:50,690
Thank you.

255
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,990
But I want it now!

256
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:54,390
That's the thing.

257
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,030
I wanted it now.

258
00:13:59,230 --> 00:13:59,610
So...

259
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,510
By the way, I still haven't picked up my trash can.

260
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,990
It's, like, down in the lobby still.

261
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,650
And, like, they actually texted me.

262
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,630
The lobby...

263
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,510
The concierge downstairs actually texted me.

264
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,430
And was like, please pick up your packages.

265
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,350
Because, like, we need the room for other packages for the other residents.

266
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,110
That was two days ago.

267
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,590
Yesterday, I did go downstairs to pick up the kettle.

268
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,590
But I was like...

269
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,030
They were like, do you want to pick up this?

270
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,750
I was like, no, I'll pick it up later.

271
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,350
I'll come back downstairs to pick it up.

272
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,430
I'm going to pick up this first.

273
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,350
I didn't go back downstairs.

274
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:36,930
I...

275
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:46,330
I didn't say when I was going to come back.

276
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:46,630
Okay?

277
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,170
Eventually...

278
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,610
Eventually, I'll pick it up.

279
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,710
But I got the kettle.

280
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,770
I went downstairs.

281
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,010
There was a trash can.

282
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,630
And I was like, oh, I don't have enough hands for both boxes.

283
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,310
So, let me just pick this first.

284
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,550
And then, I'll come back downstairs to pick up the other stuff.

285
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,090
Anyway...

286
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,630
Pick it up now, Doki.

287
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,510
Thank you for the magenta soup.

288
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:17,510
Thank you, thank you.

289
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,070
Anyway...

290
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,290
Anyway, so...

291
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:30,070
This is my solution regarding the spicy noodles.

292
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,560
So, you see...

293
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:33,430
I don't have a bowl.

294
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,130
See, that was my biggest problem.

295
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,910
I didn't have a bowl.

296
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:46,910
So, I was like, how am I going to make the carbonara spicy noodles if I don't have a bowl for this?

297
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,170
If it's not in cup noodle form.

298
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,990
And I don't have, like, a pot.

299
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,590
So, what I did...

300
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,490
Look, it's all about working smarter.

301
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:02,210
What I did was I saw there was the big shin ramen cup noodles that they do have.

302
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,370
So, I bought one of the shin ramen cup noodles.

303
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,750
And I just went back home.

304
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:16,530
I opened it and just took out the ramen inside.

305
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,390
And then transferred the bowl of noodles into...

306
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,530
I just needed the cup, you see.

307
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,770
All I needed was the cup.

308
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:31,350
So, I took the ramen noodles out.

309
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,230
Instant noodles out.

310
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,270
Put the bowl of noodles in.

311
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:39,510
And I even have the flap to cover it up to heat up the noodles.

312
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:50,130
Anyway, it's not like I'm not going to use the shin ramen instant noodles another time.

313
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:54,690
Just that I just wanted to eat the bowl of noodles first.

314
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,590
So, yay!

315
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,230
What's that phrase called?

316
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,970
Something requires modern solutions.

317
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,150
Modern problems require modern solutions.

318
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,030
So, that's what I did.

319
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:21,810
I also bought mozzarella cheese.

320
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:30,310
Because I've been watching a lot of Korean convenience store shorts.

321
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,450
I don't even watch TikTok.

322
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,010
I watch shorts, which is basically people stealing content from TikTok and putting it on YouTube.

323
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,990
So, I've been watching a lot of Korean convenience store shorts.

324
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,730
And they always get those mozzarella cheese.

325
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,090
And they put it on top of the bowl of noodles.

326
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,530
And then they microwave the noodles after all of that.

327
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:54,830
And it's always looked so good.

328
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,930
So, I did that too.

329
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,130
And it was actually really good.

330
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:01,270
That was a really good life hack right there.

331
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,580
I also ended up going to the regular market.

332
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,120
Because I wanted to buy the mozzarella cheese.

333
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,340
Because I was like, you know what?

334
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:23,420
I already went through the hassle of buying the noodles.

335
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,280
I might as well go for the full Korean convenience store experience.

336
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:33,220
And then go to a regular supermarket to buy mozzarella cheese.

337
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,060
And some meat and stuff to put on it.

338
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,820
And everything.

339
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Not eggs though.

340
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
I tend to buy eggs.

341
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,280
But I didn't have a pan.

342
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,000
And then I was like, oh my god.

343
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,140
I don't want to just cook the egg in the microwave.

344
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,960
I didn't trust myself.

345
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,320
I was like, you know what?

346
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,760
I'm already sort of barely living right now with what I'm doing.

347
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,320
So, I shouldn't push the boundaries.

348
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,720
So, I almost did.

349
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,700
I was like, I shouldn't push the boundaries here.

350
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,820
So, I did it.

351
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,040
So, I did not do that.

352
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,100
I'm not boiling the egg.

353
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,260
I meant like cracking the egg and putting it in the soup.

354
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,000
And then microwaving it.

355
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,240
Like with the noodles.

356
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,580
That's what I was thinking about.

357
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,740
But then like, you know, rational thought came in clutch at that last moment.

358
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,500
I was like, that might not be a good idea.

359
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:44,620
You're already pushing the boundaries here by like, you know, by everything else you do in life.

360
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,620
And then because I was at the supermarket, there was bread.

361
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,100
Like there was a bread knife.

362
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,560
Like I was literally looking through stuff.

363
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,880
I was like, oh my god.

364
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,920
There's a bread knife right here.

365
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,600
You know what?

366
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,700
I have so much bread.

367
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,880
At this point, this is just an investment.

368
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,700
So, you guys know how...

369
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,780
You guys...

370
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,620
Everybody was like...

371
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:09,040
I posted a photo on Twitter of like me and my bread knife.

372
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:09,860
And like...

373
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,300
First off, I'm not bad at cutting bread.

374
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,060
It was my first time cutting bread.

375
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,280
But I'm not bad at cutting bread.

376
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,700
The reason the bread looked like that was because...

377
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,000
I told you guys.

378
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,680
I was ripping the bread with my fingers.

379
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,540
And also using a wooden cutter knife.

380
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,220
Like those disposable wooden knives.

381
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,760
So, I was using that to cut my bread.

382
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,880
And then, you know...

383
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,940
I would cut it halfway.

384
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,180
Because it's like a fucking wooden knife.

385
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,180
And then I would rip it with my hands.

386
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,340
Because I was like...

387
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
I live alone.

388
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,900
Who's gonna know?

389
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,320
But then because I told that story to you guys on stream.

390
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,780
I was getting judged.

391
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,140
And I was like...

392
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,720
Maybe I should reintegrate into society.

393
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,540
And so, I bought a bread knife.

394
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,140
And now...

395
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,360
Now, you guys are judging me for my lack of plates.

396
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,680
But it's like...

397
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,300
Why do I need plates?

398
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,360
If I could just, you know...

399
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,480
Not use actual plates.

400
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,680
And just use my paper plates.

401
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,920
Because after I'm done eating...

402
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,480
I can recycle the plates and not wash them.

403
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,420
I don't have to think about them no more.

404
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,340
Like...

405
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,060
You'll never be satisfied.

406
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,020
Like...

407
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,040
There's always a new problem.

408
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,000
JL, thank you for the super chat.

409
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,200
Thank you, thank you.

410
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,540
My kami-oshi is the ultimate girl failure.

411
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,840
I can't believe it.

412
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,020
Thank you for the super chat.

413
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,780
Thank you, thank you.

414
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,660
Waste is so waste.

415
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,360
Well, it's paper.

416
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,600
You can recycle paper.

417
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,340
It's not like I'm throwing it in the trash, trash.

418
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,320
They have...

419
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,200
There's like 200 different types of like...

420
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:04,980
Trash cans.

421
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
Like the big trash cans.

422
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:07,740
Like...

423
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,820
For the building.

424
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,980
And like it's all marked and everything.

425
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:11,780
And they're like...

426
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,160
If you don't sort your trash out properly...

427
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,680
We're gonna find you.

428
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,460
So...

429
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,720
So I actually try my best...

430
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,820
To like sort the trash properly.

431
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,780
Because they're like...

432
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,520
We're gonna find you if you don't sort out your trash.

433
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,700
Anyway.

434
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,100
Okay, I'm back.

435
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,240
Okay, I'm back.

436
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,780
Okay.

437
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,480
Okay, maybe they found me.

438
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,380
Maybe...

439
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,760
Okay.

440
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,440
There might...

441
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
I did maybe once or twice.

442
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,840
I didn't sort my trash.

443
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,680
It was just once or twice.

444
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,660
Okay, I was...

445
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,520
Feeling particularly...

446
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,480
Very lazy.

447
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,540
And I put everything in one...

448
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,780
One trash bag.

449
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,040
And I was like...

450
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,940
I am tired.

451
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,240
I don't wanna sort my trash right now.

452
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:05,860
I...

453
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,480
Okay.

454
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,680
Okay, I admit.

455
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,740
I did lie.

456
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,120
It was a tiny lie.

457
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,760
It was like once or twice.

458
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,080
Maybe three times.

459
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,300
Okay, I lived here for like...

460
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,680
Three to four months already.

461
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,500
Look, I...

462
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,400
I admit.

463
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,600
Maybe...

464
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,720
Maybe it wasn't just once or twice.

465
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,520
Maybe it was three times.

466
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,040
I lived here for so long.

467
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,900
Like, I could have a freebie.

468
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,460
Maybe several freebies.

469
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,180
Anyway.

470
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,740
There's my bread knife.

471
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,580
You can even see...

472
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,800
Dad's feet right here.

473
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,600
Cause he was like...

474
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,140
Ooh, bread.

475
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,820
Maybe it was four to five.

476
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,860
Who's keeping count?

477
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,240
You're not keeping count.

478
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm not keeping count.

479
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,140
Who's keeping count right now?

480
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,320
And yes, I'm cutting it on a paper plate.

481
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,280
It makes no difference to me.

482
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,780
People are like, you should get a cutting board.

483
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,220
Or like, you should get a real plate.

484
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,960
It makes no difference.

485
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,500
It's a plate.

486
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,280
It works.

487
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,720
I did not struggle.

488
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,420
I put chop, chop, chop, slice, slice.

489
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,460
It worked.

490
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,900
It had no issues at all.

491
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,640
I had no issues cutting...

492
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,560
Cutting the bread.

493
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,520
Yes, it does.

494
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,400
It's not even...

495
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,020
It's paper.

496
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,320
It's just...

497
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,560
It's just bread.

498
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,740
It does not make any difference to me.

499
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,740
Anyway.

500
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,800
So...

501
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:44,840
So...

502
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,700
That was today's life update.

503
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,840
It's not a sad life update.

504
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,040
Like, I'm slowly reintegrating into society.

505
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,520
Like, it's not an ugly cut.

506
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,560
I told you.

507
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,180
This is where I ripped the bread.

508
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,240
This is before.

509
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,840
That area right here.

510
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,800
The missing...

511
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,580
That area right here where it's missing.

512
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,460
Right here.

513
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,380
This is where I had no knife.

514
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,120
So, I was ripping the bread.

515
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,860
I was ripping the bread.

516
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,000
So, like...

517
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,160
Because of that...

518
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,740
The bread was not very...

519
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,200
You know...

520
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,420
Was not very full.

521
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,080
Because I was just ripping it into pieces.

522
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,620
And using my wooden knife.

523
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,400
Because I was like...

524
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,420
Who's gonna know?

525
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,080
Like...

526
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,300
I live by myself.

527
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,540
Who's gonna fucking know that that's how I eat bread?

528
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,200
And then...

529
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,980
I was like...

530
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,760
You know what?

531
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,320
I'm gonna tell my chat about my lovely bread story.

532
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,160
And then...

533
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,400
Instead...

534
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,720
Of being like...

535
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,160
Haha.

536
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,580
What a funny, lovely bread story.

537
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,160
Everybody was like...

538
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,100
Get a fucking bread knife.

539
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,940
So, I...

540
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,760
So, I came in the peer pressure.

541
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,260
Because I was like...

542
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,000
Maybe this isn't normal.

543
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,160
You know?

544
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,520
Maybe what I'm doing...

545
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,600
Isn't normal.

546
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,920
Maybe I should buy a bread knife.

547
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,380
And be like...

548
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,060
A normal human being.

549
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,000
So...

550
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,260
So...

551
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,440
I bought a bread knife.

552
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,320
And now you guys are complaining about my plates.

553
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,400
So like...

554
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,980
What do you want from me?

555
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,320
Thank you for the super chat.

556
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,020
Thank you.

557
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,720
Thank you.

558
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,300
It makes me sad to hear you living like a fucking caveman.

559
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,940
Thank you for the super chat.

560
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,520
Thank you.

561
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,320
Thank you.

562
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,180
Cookies, thank you for the super chat.

563
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,580
Thank you.

564
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,140
Thank you.

565
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,260
Just take my money and get supplies.

566
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,940
Thank you for the super chat.

567
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,320
Thank you, thank you.

568
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,280
We were expecting the bare minimum, Doki.

569
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,820
This isn't the bare minimum.

570
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,900
You did not even reach it.

571
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,560
Like...

572
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,280
Alright.

573
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,100
So, yeah.

574
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,020
That was...

575
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,280
That's my life update.

576
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,300
That's really it.

577
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,000
That's all I wanted to talk about regarding today's life.

578
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,580
Darkblade, thank you for the super chat.

579
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,340
Thank you, thank you.

580
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,060
Do you own a broom and dustpan?

581
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,340
Do you own pots?

582
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I told you I don't have pots and pans.

583
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,380
That's why I bought a separate cup noodle.

584
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,660
Because I don't have a bowl or a pot to boil my noodles.

585
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,800
So I have to buy a separate cup noodle.

586
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,860
Dissect that.

587
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,140
Take away its innards.

588
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,440
And then transfer...

589
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,060
Do like a noodle transplant into the cup to make my spicy noodles.

590
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,260
No, I don't have...

591
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,060
I need to buy a...

592
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,140
I need to buy like those little robot cleaners.

593
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,500
What are they called?

594
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,620
The little robot guys that clean the floor for you automatically.

595
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,020
I need to buy that.

596
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,400
The Roombas.

597
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:57,820
Yes.

598
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:01,140
But the thing is, first off, I need to unpack first.

599
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,620
I need to get a Roomba.

600
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,020
But it's like step by step.

601
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,340
Because I need to unpack and like clean my office space and the rest of my living situation.

602
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,700
So I can justify buying a Roomba.

603
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:22,240
Because if I buy a Roomba now, the Roomba's gonna be like, where the fuck do I go?

604
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,360
It's gonna be like...

605
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,660
Why do I...

606
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,680
Why am I here?

607
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,180
What...

608
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,620
How do I clean when I...

609
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,240
There's no space to clean.

610
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,340
So...

611
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,400
So I got...

612
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,500
It's like one step at a time type deal right now.

613
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,220
I mostly unpack the office space.

614
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,400
But like...

615
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,580
It's sort of not actually unpacked.

616
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,300
But like my PC's here.

617
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,780
Like I can work.

618
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,940
That's...

619
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:55,840
That's good.

620
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,980
NPC, thank you for the super chat.

621
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,040
Thank you, thank you.

622
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,460
For my birthday, could you get yourself a cutting board instead of singing?

623
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,280
Hope you have a spooky time with Frankie.

624
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,860
Thank you for your super chat.

625
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,740
Thank you, thank you.

626
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,380
Happy birthday to you.

627
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,000
Happy birthday to you.

628
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,640
Happy birthday dear NPC.

629
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,220
Happy birthday to you.

630
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:15,560
Yeah!

631
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,060
Okay.

632
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,020
Anyway.

633
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,380
Alright, time...

634
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,260
Okay, now you guys can stop judging me.

635
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,660
It's time to play video games.

636
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,160
It's time to escape reality, guys.

637
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,120
Yeah, video games!

638
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,660
It's time to escape reality.

639
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,960
Let's go.

640
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,460
I love video games.

641
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Let's go.

642
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:47,520
Run away from the real world.

643
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,700
Let's find Frankie, guys.

644
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,580
Let's go.

645
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,840
Rin, thank you for the super chat.

646
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,580
Thank you, thank you.

647
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,020
Roomba had not seen such a room before.

648
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,240
Thank you for the super chat.

649
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,580
Thank you, thank you.

650
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:01,820
Alright.

651
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:03,580
Let's see.

652
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,360
I did some...

653
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,660
Oh, wait.

654
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,920
There's a speed run timer?

655
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,860
Wait, really?

656
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,500
Oh my god, that's funny.

657
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,460
What does it look like?

658
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,180
What is the speed run time?

659
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,800
Nah, we don't need to do a speed run here.

660
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,900
Okay, head bobbing off.

661
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,560
I hate head...

662
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,980
What the fuck is a body?

663
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,540
Like, what is that?

664
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,040
Oh, that's me!

665
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,260
Okay, let me move some stuff around.

666
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,960
So I can like, see the screen properly.

667
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:27,820
Alright.

668
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,080
Alright, here we go.

669
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,960
Guys, it's time to play video games.

670
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,260
Forget about the real world.

671
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,060
We're here to forget about the real world now.

672
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,840
It's time for video games.

673
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,620
My life is not a mess.

674
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,180
Mmm.

675
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,220
Oh, hey.

676
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,900
Frankie's Fruit Flakes.

677
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,120
Morning Crunch.

678
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,340
Do people still eat cereal?

679
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,780
I feel like there's so many like, better alternatives now than cereal.

680
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,580
Oh my god, he's famous.

681
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,040
He's like Mickey Mouse before parkour.

682
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,360
Oh my god!

683
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,380
He got it!

684
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,520
He got the audition tape!

685
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:23,920
Oh.

686
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:25,740
Whoa.

687
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,480
Those are just props, right?

688
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,580
They're just props, guys.

689
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,680
Nothing to worry about.

690
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,540
I think like, cereal is more for like, children.

691
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,380
I mean, it's always been for children.

692
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,280
But like, I feel like there's now like, better alternatives to cereal.

693
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,200
I guess people want like, something quick.

694
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,680
So you aren't late for school and stuff like that.

695
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:54,850
Me?!

696
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,490
Oh my god, this is a mascot horror.

697
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,330
Here's the mascot horror checklist.

698
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:04,990
Uh, one.

699
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,130
Does it come with an animated short introducing where you are?

700
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:11,690
Giving you exposition of what's going on?

701
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:16,870
Alright, two.

702
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,570
Did they take something that's considered normal?

703
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,030
Oh, 19!

704
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,790
Numbers, numbers, numbers!

705
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,650
Oh my god, my 19k bots!

706
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,630
Deputy Duck Frankie.

707
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:30,770
Oh, are they all like, quirky little characters there?

708
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,970
With like, uh, some nine...

709
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,970
Some like, old classic cartoon art style.

710
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,470
Oh, sound is low?

711
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,370
Okay, let me fix that real quick.

712
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,010
Uh, let's see.

713
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:51,030
Alright, let's turn down the sensitivity too.

714
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,070
The sensitivity is so fucking high.

715
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,510
Holy shit.

716
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,410
Alright, there you go.

717
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,690
Oh, is this my costume?

718
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,630
Alright.

719
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,150
Attraction key.

720
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,870
Entrance one, plaza.

721
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:04,950
Main lobby.

722
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,590
Parkour room number one.

723
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,390
Finding Frankie is out of service.

724
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,470
Hexahavoc.

725
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,110
Parkour room.

726
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,150
Hide and Henry?

727
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,710
Oh no, I gotta hide?

728
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,730
Oh hey!

729
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,110
Oh, it's more than- Oh, it is Fall Guys!

730
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,830
You're all cho-chosen too?

731
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,550
Don't worry.

732
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:26,710
Hello, friends!

733
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,270
Oh my god, we're all chosen!

734
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,530
Today's gonna be- Oh, he's locked in.

735
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,390
Look at him go.

736
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,250
He's so locked in.

737
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,030
Wait, how do I know- Oh!

738
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,810
Woah, woah, woah!

739
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:37,370
Woah!

740
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,390
Woah, woah, woah!

741
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:39,710
Woah, okay!

742
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:41,790
Okay, he was way too locked in!

743
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,090
He was way too locked in!

744
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:43,870
You know what?

745
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,170
He- Woah!

746
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,030
Woah!

747
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:50,690
Second- You know what they say, second's the best!

748
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,810
Oh my god.

749
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,110
Oh, okay.

750
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,330
He got locked out.

751
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:58,250
Alright.

752
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,030
Run in the doors to kick them.

753
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,550
Alright, now we know, guys.

754
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,890
It's better to not be first place.

755
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,850
Now we know.

756
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:09,950
Wait.

757
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,170
Jump in front?

758
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,370
Oh, we already did it?

759
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,530
We completed the tutorial?

760
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:16,710
Wow, that was- What?

761
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:19,410
Okay.

762
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,210
How do I grab this?

763
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:22,850
Oh!

764
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:23,270
Oh!

765
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,730
Okay, I figured this out.

766
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:26,350
Watch this.

767
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:28,830
Okay.

768
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,250
This does not feel so natural at all.

769
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:32,130
Wait, what?

770
00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:36,930
Oh my god, I have to do- Okay, while moving forward, press space to jump off.

771
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,350
Alright.

772
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,410
Oh, I have to jump to it.

773
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:45,730
I have to- Okay, this- That part doesn't feel as natural.

774
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,390
What?

775
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:48,710
I hit it!

776
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:53,630
I swear to god, I swear to god I did.

777
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:54,630
I hit spacebar.

778
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,030
Okay.

779
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:57,970
Alright.

780
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,970
And then...

781
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,790
I'm gaming.

782
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,010
Alright, now I figured it out.

783
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,530
Alright.

784
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,810
Safety training, return to the lobby.

785
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,870
How do I go back to the lobby?

786
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,570
Oh, this way.

787
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,210
Alright.

788
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,570
Alright, we did it, guys!

789
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,190
We learned how to parkour!

790
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,230
Now I need to figure out how to get back home.

791
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,870
Oh, I guess I have to parkour back?

792
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:24,590
Alright.

793
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:27,070
Must be 18- The parent pad.

794
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,090
Do I just go back?

795
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,430
I did it!

796
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,310
Oh, I slide so fast!

797
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:36,870
Hello!

798
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:40,350
Whoa!

799
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:40,570
Whoa!

800
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,270
Hello?

801
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,230
Hey guys, I did my thing.

802
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:49,150
Oh, I completed it!

803
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,350
So I get to be here!

804
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,120
Oh my god, what happened to them?

805
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,340
Yeah!

806
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,810
Oh, it's PG?!

807
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,470
Just like my honeypot stream!

808
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,130
I mean, making kids is- Does have parents involved.

809
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,190
Whoa!

810
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,890
I should give him a visit?

811
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,130
Alright, nice.

812
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,070
Alright.

813
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,610
What did I open?

814
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:31,930
Oh, I opened back here.

815
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,290
Okay.

816
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,130
Open the back door.

817
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:35,950
Hello?

818
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,140
Whoa.

819
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:47,980
I don't like- Whoa, I don't like the eyes he's giving me right now.

820
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,660
Whoa.

821
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,480
Please, this show is for children, sir.

822
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,560
Please, this is a kid's show.

823
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,700
I feel a little uncomfortable.

824
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,680
Here, you're literally a phone.

825
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,300
I need a key.

826
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,100
What did I open here?

827
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,680
I open this?

828
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,420
Oh, I did.

829
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,460
I had a feeling it was this.

830
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,180
Okay, circuit breaker.

831
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,360
Parkour ahead.

832
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:13,720
Okay.

833
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,080
I'm gonna wait until it explodes.

834
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,060
Cause I already fucked it.

835
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,660
I already fucked up the timing anyway.

836
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,040
Oh, wait, does it not matter?

837
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,680
Oh.

838
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,080
There we go.

839
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,120
Okay, it does matter.

840
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,240
There we go.

841
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:31,760
Nice.

842
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,160
Wait, this game is so easy.

843
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,940
This is a game- This is act- What was that?

844
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,740
What?

845
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,680
What was that?

846
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:44,180
It just gave me a- I didn't even see- What was that?

847
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,400
I'm sorry.

848
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,300
I'm so sorry.

849
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,560
I'M SO SORRY.

850
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:53,260
I'm sorry.

851
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,020
It gave me scary music.

852
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,760
What happened?

853
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,780
What the fuck?

854
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,160
Okay.

855
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:08,600
Okay.

856
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,260
Oh my god.

857
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,920
This game is so easy.

858
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,040
Oh my god.

859
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,420
I'm like- I don't- I don't- Where do I- Where do I go?

860
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,180
No!

861
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:24,900
Where do I hide?

862
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,680
Where do I hide?

863
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,390
I don't- No!

864
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,550
Where do I hide?

865
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,510
Instructions unclear!

866
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,710
Just don't fall off.

867
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,070
Where do I hide?

868
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:47,870
I- He said- He said hide!

869
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:49,670
Fucking where?

870
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,950
Just don't fall.

871
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:53,490
It's parkour, Doki.

872
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,950
There's no such thing as hiding in parkour.

873
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,910
Where do I- Where do I hide?

874
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:06,370
Okay.

875
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:08,490
Alright.

876
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,150
I can do this.

877
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,030
He doesn't know.

878
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,690
He doesn't know.

879
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,610
How would he know?

880
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:24,730
How would he know?

881
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:26,550
Oh, thank god.

882
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,150
Oh, thank god.

883
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,270
Oh, thank god he didn't know.

884
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,670
Oh, thank god.

885
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,210
Guys, he didn't know.

886
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,910
There was- There was no other way.

887
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,050
It was broken!

888
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,590
You guys lied to me!

889
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,730
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

890
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,950
How would he know?

891
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:46,990
How would he know?

892
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,010
How would he know?

893
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:48,830
How would he know?

894
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:51,790
He can go up!

895
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,570
I didn't think he would look up!

896
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,750
He can look up.

897
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,110
I didn't think he would look up!

898
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,030
Everybody knows gamers don't look up!

899
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,590
He's not a real gamer.

900
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,530
He wasn't a real gamer.

901
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,170
He's not a gamer.

902
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,250
Guys.

903
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,190
Guys.

904
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:26,890
Please, I only watched the first six minutes of Parkour Civilization.

905
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:27,470
Please.

906
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:28,730
Please.

907
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,810
I only watched the first six minutes.

908
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,310
I don't know how it ends.

909
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:40,310
I just know about the chicken and beef.

910
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:45,990
Oh my god.

911
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,230
I'm fine.

912
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:54,170
I know you can swing, but I get too excited and I just let go.

913
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,010
I let go!

914
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,410
I can't help it!

915
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,390
Oh my god.

916
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:05,630
Oh my god.

917
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:06,310
Alright.

918
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:10,210
Meet Henry Hotline and get a chance to ask him a question on his late night show.

919
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,350
Make your way through the Henry Museum and enter Visit Studio or go down to the Henry Household.

920
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,110
Who keeps ringing this phone?

921
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:18,970
Oh, he must be a nice guy.

922
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,510
He seems like a very nice guy.

923
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,210
Wait, he's like the...

924
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:32,250
Ring.

925
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,430
Henry?

926
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,110
Is Henry not gonna pick up the phone?

927
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:40,630
Henry?

928
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:45,450
Why is Henry not picking up the phone?

929
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:46,790
Hello?

930
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:49,370
I thought you said Henry would call.

931
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,070
Henry doesn't even care.

932
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,970
You know what Henry looks like?

933
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,690
Late night show with Jimmy Fallon, right?

934
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,770
He looks like a Jimmy Fallon host.

935
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:11,770
Alright.

936
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:16,530
Alright, this is where the parkour is, but like, is there anything here?

937
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:16,930
Okay.

938
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,390
Okay, there is a trampoline.

939
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,090
Where's the next circuit breaker?

940
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,050
Out of order?

941
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,450
Oh fuck, oh no.

942
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:30,390
I don't know where the sec- Oh, there it is, there it is!

943
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,950
Okay, parkour.

944
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:33,210
Nice.

945
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:35,190
A door has been opened.

946
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:37,070
I don't know which door, but I did it.

947
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,390
Oh, I don't know which door.

948
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,510
There's so many doors.

949
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,790
Which door is it?

950
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:44,610
Okay.

951
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:48,170
Apparently, like...

952
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,390
There was like...

953
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:56,110
Jimmy Fallon actually broke character because his newest guests were like the Costco boys or what?

954
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:57,670
I don't even...

955
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,620
I don't even know who- I didn't think they were like a popular thing.

956
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,210
Like, what was it?

957
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,750
The Costco boys?

958
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,530
Oh my god, somebody help that third child.

959
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:09,050
That...

960
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,610
Yeah, right.

961
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,050
Who?

962
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,830
Yeah, it popped up on my Twitter.

963
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:20,850
Like, I remember seeing one video of them because Meat Canyon made like a parody thing about it.

964
00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:22,190
Wait, but what's this then?

965
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:28,490
Because like Meat Canyon did a parody of like the Costco boys and that's literally the only reason why I know who they are.

966
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,970
We're the Co- Yeah, we're the Costco guys.

967
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:34,990
Okay, what's wrong with this?

968
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,230
Oh, it's a little Easter.

969
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,430
It's like a little collectible.

970
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:40,430
Oh no, this...

971
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:43,770
This seems Poppy Playtime.

972
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,690
Oh, what's wrong with that phone?

973
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:50,010
That looks like a nice phone.

974
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,630
That doesn't look dangerous at all.

975
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,400
Alright, parkour.

976
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,620
Parkour.

977
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,260
Yay, parkour.

978
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,940
I must be like the fucking slowest parkour right now.

979
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,580
Wait, where did I go?

980
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,480
I did the parkour.

981
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,280
There's more?

982
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,160
What parkour did I miss?

983
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,340
What, what parkour- Oh my god, the beginning.

984
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:27,020
The- The first button.

985
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:29,640
Alright.

986
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,460
Yeah, it was like, I was just like...

987
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,580
All I could think about is the third child.

988
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,320
I was like, is he okay?

989
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,800
Like, that's all I could think about.

990
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,700
Wait, whoa.

991
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,440
Whoa, oh, hey there.

992
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,340
Hey.

993
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:47,300
Hey, oh.

994
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,520
Want a hand?

995
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,880
Oh, thanks for giving me a hand.

996
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,880
Oh, that's sweet.

997
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,540
You gave me a hand.

998
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,880
Hold E.

999
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:03,620
Wait.

1000
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:05,980
Where the fuck do I go?

1001
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:08,820
Oh!

1002
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,640
Oh, fucking...

1003
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,600
The breaker right in front of me?

1004
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:13,120
Wait.

1005
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,100
There we go.

1006
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,880
Nice.

1007
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,500
I did it.

1008
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,200
What does that open though?

1009
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,480
Okay, follow the red line.

1010
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:24,880
Oh, down here.

1011
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,660
Must be here then.

1012
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,120
Oh my god, I go so fast.

1013
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:30,760
Ooh.

1014
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,400
Whoa!

1015
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,560
Who's that?

1016
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:37,300
Alright.

1017
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,560
Oh god!

1018
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,240
Oh god!

1019
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,740
He's chasing me!

1020
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,280
He's chasing me!

1021
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,820
Okay, I'm sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding.

1022
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:46,700
Where do I go?

1023
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:47,620
Where do I...

1024
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,420
Don't touch me!

1025
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,040
Oh.

1026
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:04,940
Oh my god.

1027
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,200
I don't know.

1028
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,660
It's just like a deer in headlights situation.

1029
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:16,400
I like see him and I was like, what do I do?

1030
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,620
I don't know!

1031
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,100
I feel like...

1032
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,580
I'm like a deer!

1033
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:25,940
I'm like a fucking deer when I see it!

1034
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,720
Like, I fucking, I don't know!

1035
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,440
I feel like...

1036
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,740
Oh my god!

1037
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:33,820
Oh my god.

1038
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,860
I don't...

1039
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,200
I don't...

1040
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,100
I don't do well when I'm under...

1041
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:38,360
Ah!

1042
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,440
So much pressure.

1043
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,160
Oh my god.

1044
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,200
I don't want him to find me no more.

1045
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,120
I just...

1046
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:55,280
I'm just like, oh my god, he's approaching me.

1047
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,060
What do I do?

1048
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:57,360
Do I just look at him?

1049
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:58,160
Like...

1050
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,740
I don't know.

1051
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,320
I just, I'm just like...

1052
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,900
Do I look at him?

1053
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,800
Oh my god!

1054
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:07,280
What is he looking at?

1055
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,240
Is he looking at me?

1056
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:13,280
Oh my god, please.

1057
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,800
Like, it's not fair because I slide so fast!

1058
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,000
Oh my god, I hear him.

1059
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,260
I actually...

1060
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,160
I hear him!

1061
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,620
I can't...

1062
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,120
I can't...

1063
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,340
I think I hate this game.

1064
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:49,960
Oh my god.

1065
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,040
I'm clicking so fast.

1066
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,040
But you know when you click too fast...

1067
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,740
I'm not okay.

1068
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,120
I'm not okay.

1069
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,240
I'm not okay, guys.

1070
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,880
Oh my god, I'm too fast.

1071
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,080
I'm too fast.

1072
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,800
Everything is too fast.

1073
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,180
Everything is...

1074
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,040
Oh my god, I have to...

1075
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:10,980
How?

1076
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:11,500
How?

1077
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,080
How?

1078
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:17,850
Okay.

1079
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,490
Okay.

1080
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:19,650
Smash!

1081
00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:20,450
Smash!

1082
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,670
Smash!

1083
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:22,270
Fuck!

1084
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,930
Okay.

1085
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,630
Everything is fine.

1086
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,290
Everything is fine.

1087
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:27,830
Parkour!

1088
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:29,530
Parkour!

1089
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:31,630
I'm trying!

1090
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:33,950
I swear I'm not trying!

1091
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,130
I'm trying!

1092
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:36,070
I'm trying!

1093
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:36,910
I'm...

1094
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,430
No!

1095
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:38,510
No!

1096
00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:40,250
I...

1097
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,190
Oh my god, I swear...

1098
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:43,830
I swear I'm trying my best here.

1099
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:44,410
I'm fucking...

1100
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:45,190
I'm not trolling.

1101
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,750
I'm not throwing intentionally.

1102
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:47,850
It's just...

1103
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:48,730
He's just...

1104
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:48,990
How?

1105
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,530
How?

1106
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:51,690
How is he still holding that?

1107
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:55,570
I'm calm.

1108
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,250
It's okay.

1109
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:56,790
I'm...

1110
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,430
Everything...

1111
00:48:58,430 --> 00:48:58,710
Ah!

1112
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,470
That was a pretty neat...

1113
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,250
That was a neat parkour.

1114
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,950
It's so bad.

1115
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:07,590
Well, that was it.

1116
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:08,590
That wasn't...

1117
00:49:09,830 --> 00:49:12,410
That wasn't so bad, guys.

1118
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:15,770
I'm calm.

1119
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:19,910
Okay, alright.

1120
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,170
By the way, how...

1121
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:22,890
How's the sound right now, guys?

1122
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:23,710
I should have asked you that.

1123
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,910
I don't know if sound guy is alive.

1124
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:26,250
I don't think he is.

1125
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:27,730
I don't...

1126
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:29,910
I don't think sound guy is alive.

1127
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:32,870
Oh my god.

1128
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,270
I feel so relaxed.

1129
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:38,850
Right now.

1130
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,770
Fuck, I don't...

1131
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:44,050
Okay.

1132
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:46,250
Let me up the game sound a little.

1133
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,030
Okay.

1134
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,090
Here we go.

1135
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:50,590
Alright.

1136
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:51,150
Let's...

1137
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,290
Let's wait a little bit.

1138
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:52,730
Let's...

1139
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,590
Let's relax and...

1140
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:55,390
Wait a little.

1141
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:56,410
Oh, you know what?

1142
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,190
I got this.

1143
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,650
Where's the last one, though?

1144
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:01,330
Oh!

1145
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,650
Where could the last one...

1146
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:05,910
Oh, it's over here.

1147
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:08,110
How do I get up there?

1148
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:08,890
Oh my god.

1149
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:09,990
How do I get up there?

1150
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:15,450
Oh, at least I could like relax a little bit and figure this out before anything.

1151
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:16,610
How do I...

1152
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,630
Oh, is it like here?

1153
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:19,910
How do I...

1154
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,290
Wait, how do I get up there?

1155
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,050
The thing is over here.

1156
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,190
Where's the parkour for this?

1157
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:34,710
Alright, turn down the game music.

1158
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:35,170
Okay.

1159
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,650
Alright.

1160
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:38,890
Got you.

1161
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,350
How the fuck do I...

1162
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:41,670
Oh!

1163
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:43,630
It's here!

1164
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:44,470
Right?

1165
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:46,990
Can I make that jump?

1166
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,670
No, I don't think so.

1167
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:49,990
Oh!

1168
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:53,670
Gamers don't look up.

1169
00:50:57,870 --> 00:50:58,670
Parkour.

1170
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,230
Gamers don't look up.

1171
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:02,790
Okay, so that's...

1172
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,810
Wait, there has to be a secret over there, then.

1173
00:51:06,450 --> 00:51:08,230
There has to be a secret, then.

1174
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:09,670
Because there's like...

1175
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,110
More to the vent jumping.

1176
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:15,770
Guys, the problem why I didn't see that is because it wasn't yellow.

1177
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,370
Like, who makes it red?

1178
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:18,990
Red is bad.

1179
00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:20,750
That's all I'm saying.

1180
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:24,150
Red is supposed to be bad, so why...

1181
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,430
That's their fault.

1182
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:26,570
Honestly.

1183
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:28,970
Their fault for making it red.

1184
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:30,570
Yeah, true.

1185
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,070
Oh, we can't open.

1186
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:35,710
Oh, promote.

1187
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,930
Enjoy your time in Deputy Duck's Park.

1188
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,430
Deputy Duck can't be that bad.

1189
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:41,230
Maybe he's nice.

1190
00:51:41,530 --> 00:51:41,870
You know?

1191
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,410
Maybe...

1192
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,930
Maybe he's a nice one in the...

1193
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:47,410
Maybe he's a nice guy.

1194
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:52,070
Anybody that's a duck must be a nice guy, right?

1195
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:53,730
Right?

1196
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:54,210
Right?

1197
00:51:56,010 --> 00:51:56,570
Like...

1198
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:58,970
We all know red is bad, like...

1199
00:51:58,970 --> 00:51:59,930
Like...

1200
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,090
Alright, up we go.

1201
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,590
Up we go.

1202
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,150
Yeah.

1203
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,130
There's always one nice guy.

1204
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:11,370
Guys.

1205
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:12,710
Okay.

1206
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:17,150
There's always one nice character in each mascot horror game.

1207
00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:21,150
And I bet Deputy Duck is the nicest guy around.

1208
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,810
Maybe there's something over here?

1209
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:23,930
Okay.

1210
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:28,230
Oh?

1211
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,430
Oh, I'm back here!

1212
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,010
Oh!

1213
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,830
I gave a shortcut.

1214
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:38,330
It's a little shortcut.

1215
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,590
Oh, that means I have to go back here.

1216
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:42,890
Alright.

1217
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:44,710
Here we go.

1218
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:46,290
Parkour.

1219
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,450
I'm ready.

1220
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,110
I'm ready to parkour.

1221
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:54,330
Hello, I'm here to sign in for my parkour session.

1222
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:57,810
Hello?

1223
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,070
You were right.

1224
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,730
I shouldn't have tried to eat cereal that's been in a box for 50 years.

1225
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:04,510
Whoa.

1226
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,370
Oh, he seems like a nice guy.

1227
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:11,620
Hello there.

1228
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:12,760
Oh, hey!

1229
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,760
Hey there!

1230
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:16,520
Hey!

1231
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,040
Oh, hey there!

1232
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:19,820
See?

1233
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,300
I told you!

1234
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:22,040
They're friendly!

1235
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,080
I knew they were friendly.

1236
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,900
I knew it.

1237
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,420
There's always one friendly guy.

1238
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:30,620
Look!

1239
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:30,920
See?

1240
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,580
There he is looking at me!

1241
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,800
Nothing bad can happen with ducks.

1242
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,860
All ducks are cool guys.

1243
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,820
Can I die from that?

1244
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,640
Oh god, this has to be the slowest Indiana Jones ball I've ever seen.

1245
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:51,430
Okay.

1246
00:53:54,350 --> 00:53:54,950
Okay.

1247
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:58,770
Wow, so scary.

1248
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:02,370
So scary.

1249
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,450
Oh my god.

1250
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,130
I'm so scared.

1251
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:08,430
This is not a fucking horror game.

1252
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:13,470
Honestly, easiest horror game of my fucking life.

1253
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,850
Not even scared at all.

1254
00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:17,110
This is so calming too.

1255
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,410
Like, I don't have to rush or anything.

1256
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:20,190
I just...

1257
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,710
I just gotta parkour.

1258
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,850
See?

1259
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,230
Nothing to worry about.

1260
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:28,230
Wait, how do I...

1261
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:30,470
Okay, there we go.

1262
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:32,230
And then...

1263
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,510
Look at that!

1264
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,480
Nothing scary at all.

1265
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,020
I'm not scared.

1266
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,280
I'm so calm.

1267
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,200
I'm so, so calm.

1268
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,700
Hey there!

1269
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,920
I knew you were a good guy.

1270
00:54:59,280 --> 00:54:59,560
Hello?

1271
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,360
Hello?

1272
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:07,500
Yeah?

1273
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,800
You okay there?

1274
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:18,060
Kill me.

1275
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,800
Kill me, please.

1276
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,200
They made me a TV.

1277
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,240
Deputy Duck!

1278
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,580
Oh, that was easy.

1279
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,100
Oh, flash.

1280
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,200
What the fuck?

1281
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,120
What the fuck?

1282
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,140
What did I do with you?

1283
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:54,700
How do I use you?

1284
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,220
You're just...

1285
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,840
He's just two weeks from retirement.

1286
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,160
Oh my god, he's in baby jail.

1287
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,780
Thank you for the super chat.

1288
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:04,900
Thank you, thank you.

1289
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,080
How the fuck do I use this duck?

1290
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,100
Oh!

1291
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,360
Do it.

1292
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,880
Do it.

1293
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,340
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

1294
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,340
Come on!

1295
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,480
Do your thing!

1296
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:26,970
Do your thing!

1297
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,130
Oh my god.

1298
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:28,930
Okay, you got...

1299
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,050
Did I do it?

1300
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,330
Wait, what does that do?

1301
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,510
What does the radar do?

1302
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,940
Why is it red?

1303
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,720
Why is it a dangerous color?

1304
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:46,640
Whoa!

1305
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,420
Why are you dangerous?

1306
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,180
Hyde and Henry?

1307
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:54,620
Wait.

1308
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:58,960
Wait.

1309
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,140
Wait, what does it...

1310
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,560
What do you mean by Hyde and Harry, Deputy Duck?

1311
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,700
What do you mean by that?

1312
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,780
Deputy Duck, what does Hyde and Henry mean?

1313
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,980
Oh no.

1314
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,560
Hello, Henry?

1315
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:29,140
Henry, is that you?

1316
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,540
Oh, I don't like this.

1317
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,240
Hello?

1318
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:40,300
Oh.

1319
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,340
Use to scan dark areas.

1320
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:45,700
Okay.

1321
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,030
Okay.

1322
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:52,970
Okay.

1323
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:55,010
Keep scanning.

1324
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:56,710
Oh my gosh, now I'm actually scared.

1325
00:57:57,810 --> 00:57:59,850
Bring me back to parkour, guys.

1326
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,510
This is Finding Frankie, not Finding Henry, guys.

1327
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:03,110
Give me...

1328
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,270
Bring me back...

1329
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:04,970
Give me...

1330
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:06,590
Bring me back to parkour.

1331
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:09,650
I think parkour was a lot more fun.

1332
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,210
Guys.

1333
00:58:12,490 --> 00:58:15,270
Guys, I think I had more fun with the parkour part.

1334
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:16,370
Hello?

1335
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:19,770
Hello?

1336
00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:23,690
Oh my god, Jimmy Fallon, you okay?

1337
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,430
I just pressed one button!

1338
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:30,330
Oh.

1339
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:33,650
Okay.

1340
00:58:36,110 --> 00:58:37,150
I mean...

1341
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,650
It doesn't seem that mad.

1342
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,590
I don't know, he seemed okay.

1343
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:46,130
Just gotta press another.

1344
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,930
Wonder what happens if I press this.

1345
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:50,410
Hehe.

1346
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:54,650
But what if I press that again?

1347
00:58:54,890 --> 00:58:57,370
Oh my god, wait a minute, I don't like this anymore.

1348
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,750
I don't...

1349
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:00,270
Hehe.

1350
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:04,130
Oh my god, what if he freaks out?

1351
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,790
Guys, what if he starts freaking out?

1352
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:09,530
Guys, do you think he's gonna freak out?

1353
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:10,310
Do you think...

1354
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,230
Do you think he's gonna freak out if I keep pressing the phone?

1355
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,310
Do you think he's gonna...

1356
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:19,470
WHAT?!

1357
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,410
WHAT THE FUCK?!

1358
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:26,590
I mean...

1359
00:59:26,590 --> 00:59:27,990
Guys, he's just holding my hand.

1360
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:29,270
He's just...

1361
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:30,310
He's just...

1362
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:34,750
Guys, aww, isn't that sweet?

1363
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,910
He just wants to hold my hand, guys.

1364
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:37,430
He just...

1365
00:59:38,130 --> 00:59:39,970
He just wants to...

1366
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:43,290
Guys, he just wants to hold my hand.

1367
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:45,850
Like, what do I...

1368
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:47,150
Am I supposed to like...

1369
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:48,330
Fucking...

1370
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:49,090
Flash him?

1371
00:59:49,270 --> 00:59:49,870
But like...

1372
00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:51,090
You know what I mean, guys.

1373
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:51,890
Like...

1374
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:52,650
You know?

1375
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:55,430
Like, am I supposed to...

1376
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,970
Be like...

1377
00:59:59,290 --> 00:59:59,810
Ooh...

1378
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,190
Oh, I don't like this.

1379
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:07,470
Like, does he get scared if I flash him?

1380
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,530
Like, I don't understand.

1381
01:00:11,970 --> 01:00:13,910
Oh, I don't like this part.

1382
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:14,570
Ring, ring.

1383
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,860
Ring, ring.

1384
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,710
Is this a safe room?

1385
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:24,710
This is safe, right?

1386
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:26,350
Right?

1387
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:28,530
I feel safe.

1388
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:31,770
I feel safe.

1389
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:35,470
Deputy Duck, do something.

1390
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:35,870
I feel like...

1391
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:41,470
Deputy Duck, do something.

1392
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:44,510
I don't feel safe anymore.

1393
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:53,550
Like, I want...

1394
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,470
Bring me back to the parkour.

1395
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:01,090
I just want to parkour.

1396
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:07,470
I don't feel...

1397
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:16,450
It's too far.

1398
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:17,670
Where's the last two?

1399
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:19,650
Where is it?

1400
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,630
Please, have comfort, quack.

1401
01:01:32,350 --> 01:01:34,270
Where's the last two?

1402
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,150
Where is it?

1403
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,050
I can't.

1404
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,330
I don't want to get out of the safe space.

1405
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:52,310
I don't want to get out of the safe space, guys.

1406
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:55,730
I don't feel safe.

1407
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,830
What the fuck is upstairs?

1408
01:01:58,370 --> 01:01:59,910
What the fuck is that?

1409
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:03,730
Okay.

1410
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:04,050
Okay.

1411
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:06,370
Alright, there's like one over...

1412
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,750
Okay, the last two is like over there.

1413
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:09,790
Alright.

1414
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,880
I pressed this already?

1415
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:25,520
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1416
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,460
Womp womp.

1417
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:35,380
Womp womp.

1418
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:37,320
Womp womp.

1419
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:41,480
Okay.

1420
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:46,880
Womp womp.

1421
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,000
Oh, there he is.

1422
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,460
There he is.

1423
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,520
Oh, god, there he is.

1424
01:02:52,620 --> 01:02:53,360
Womp womp.

1425
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:54,700
Womp womp.

1426
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,620
The last one's all the way back there.

1427
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,380
It's so far.

1428
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,620
It's so far.

1429
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:12,240
Stop.

1430
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,220
Stop.

1431
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,860
Stop, I'm gonna flash you.

1432
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:20,720
Does the flash do anything to him?

1433
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:21,500
I can't tell.

1434
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:22,520
I'm scared.

1435
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,980
Okay, it's like right over there.

1436
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,860
It's literally...

1437
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,360
It's right...

1438
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,200
Right there.

1439
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,700
At the very end.

1440
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:58,800
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

1441
01:03:58,800 --> 01:03:59,860
Where do I escape?

1442
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:01,800
What do you mean escape?

1443
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:03,080
Where's the...

1444
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:04,160
Where's the exit?

1445
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,980
I never paid attention to the exit door!

1446
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,360
Okay.

1447
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,500
Follow the sign.

1448
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:13,820
Okay.

1449
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:14,920
Alright.

1450
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:16,640
Three.

1451
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,700
Three.

1452
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:20,480
Two.

1453
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,320
Oh, fuck you.

1454
01:04:22,460 --> 01:04:24,480
Okay, I need a want-want appreciation.

1455
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:26,380
I need a want-want motivation.

1456
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:30,870
Want-want.

1457
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:33,950
Here we go.

1458
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:35,110
Here we go.

1459
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,610
Give me one last want-want for the ride, deputy.

1460
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:48,730
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1461
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:48,990
Go!

1462
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:49,430
Go!

1463
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,110
Wait, where does this go?

1464
01:04:56,650 --> 01:04:57,190
Where

1465
01:05:11,130 --> 01:05:11,670
does...

1466
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:16,190
Oh, oh, oh, oh, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1467
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,760
Wait, I ran back!

1468
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:26,880
I got lost!

1469
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,300
I had to...

1470
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,500
Guys,

1471
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:44,690
I got lost.

1472
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,270
I don't know how.

1473
01:05:46,470 --> 01:05:48,090
I'm back to where I started.

1474
01:05:48,610 --> 01:05:48,990
I...

1475
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,990
I...

1476
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:51,810
I...

1477
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:53,090
I don't...

1478
01:05:58,750 --> 01:05:59,770
Want-want!

1479
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,030
I don't know how this is happening to me.

1480
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:09,030
I don't know, guys.

1481
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:11,930
I'm freaking out right now.

1482
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,350
This is where I came from.

1483
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:15,530
Which way did I go?

1484
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:17,670
Oh, oh, oh.

1485
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,310
Oh, my God.

1486
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,750
I'm not tall.

1487
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,590
I'm too...

1488
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,610
Oh, hello?

1489
01:06:23,070 --> 01:06:25,310
Guys, like, there's no rational thought in my head right now.

1490
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:26,470
I'm just trying to survive.

1491
01:06:26,910 --> 01:06:28,110
Oh, ring, ring!

1492
01:06:31,050 --> 01:06:32,250
Deputy Duck!

1493
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,950
Are you okay?

1494
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:35,730
Speak to me!

1495
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,950
Oh, my leg!

1496
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:43,530
Speak to me!

1497
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,870
You gotta live!

1498
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:46,790
You gotta...

1499
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:49,050
Leave me to die, please.

1500
01:06:52,290 --> 01:06:52,990
Oh, God.

1501
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:53,670
Oh, God.

1502
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:54,390
He's coming.

1503
01:06:54,530 --> 01:06:55,150
Henry's coming.

1504
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:55,810
He's coming.

1505
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:57,690
Oh, God.

1506
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,370
Please, I can't run!

1507
01:06:59,470 --> 01:07:00,570
I'm trying to run!

1508
01:07:01,370 --> 01:07:02,030
Oh, God.

1509
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:02,570
Please.

1510
01:07:02,830 --> 01:07:03,130
Please.

1511
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:03,910
I'm trying.

1512
01:07:04,050 --> 01:07:04,750
I'm trying to run.

1513
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:05,390
I'm trying.

1514
01:07:05,510 --> 01:07:05,790
I'm trying.

1515
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:06,650
I'm so fucking-

1516
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:12,590
I can't see!

1517
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:13,270
I can't see!

1518
01:07:13,350 --> 01:07:14,470
Everything is so dark!

1519
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:15,590
Oh, my God.

1520
01:07:15,590 --> 01:07:16,610
Wait, it's fine.

1521
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,930
Where am I?

1522
01:07:19,150 --> 01:07:19,890
Where am I?

1523
01:07:20,270 --> 01:07:21,090
Where am I?

1524
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,290
Holy shit!

1525
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:29,050
Oh, close!

1526
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:29,310
Close!

1527
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:29,450
Close!

1528
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:29,610
Close!

1529
01:07:29,690 --> 01:07:29,790
Close!

1530
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:31,810
Oh, I'm in the bathroom.

1531
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:32,070
Okay.

1532
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:37,030
Okay, everything is fine.

1533
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,490
Okay.

1534
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:40,930
We're all okay.

1535
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:43,350
We're all okay.

1536
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:46,910
It's got too dark.

1537
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:50,190
Okay.

1538
01:07:50,990 --> 01:07:52,010
Oh, wait.

1539
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:53,130
That's not okay.

1540
01:07:54,350 --> 01:07:54,890
Oh.

1541
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:55,630
Oh.

1542
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,190
Whoa.

1543
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:58,010
Well, that's not good.

1544
01:07:58,810 --> 01:07:59,450
Whoa.

1545
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:00,390
Whoa.

1546
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:01,170
Whoa!

1547
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:01,910
Whoa!

1548
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:03,650
It's getting a little faster!

1549
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:05,310
Whoa!

1550
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:08,090
Is it supposed to get faster?

1551
01:08:08,990 --> 01:08:09,490
Hey!

1552
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:10,450
Hey, there!

1553
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:11,470
Hey!

1554
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,170
Whoa!

1555
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:15,010
Why is it getting- Whoa!

1556
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,610
Hey, that's- Whoa!

1557
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:18,010
Guys, calm down!

1558
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,110
Calm down, guys!

1559
01:08:20,110 --> 01:08:21,510
It's just a kid's game!

1560
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:24,550
It's broadcasted to national television, guys!

1561
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:27,110
It's fucking- We don't want anyone so wild.

1562
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:28,370
It's real death, right?

1563
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:33,090
It's not like Danganronpa built that entire fanbase over it.

1564
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:37,190
Where's my duck?

1565
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:38,070
Where's Womp Womp?

1566
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,350
I miss Womp Womp!

1567
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,310
I miss him!

1568
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:44,630
Oh my god!

1569
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:45,630
Oh my god!

1570
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:51,430
The last 20 seconds!

1571
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,690
Oh my god.

1572
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:59,930
It's okay.

1573
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,010
You know.

1574
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:03,830
It's alright.

1575
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:04,990
We can do this.

1576
01:09:05,970 --> 01:09:07,670
Guys, I was just-

1577
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:13,490
I panicked, okay?

1578
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:14,710
We all know I panicked.

1579
01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:17,170
I absolutely panicked there.

1580
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:24,890
Guys, the moment the duck was gone, it went all downhill.

1581
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:25,810
You guys know that.

1582
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,550
I miss him too, guys.

1583
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:31,130
I miss him as well, guys.

1584
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:33,650
Oh my god.

1585
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:34,830
Okay, that's fine.

1586
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:35,270
That's good.

1587
01:09:35,390 --> 01:09:36,190
We want the blues.

1588
01:09:36,290 --> 01:09:37,410
We don't want the yellows.

1589
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:38,910
The blue, I can jump through it.

1590
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:39,770
This is where I died.

1591
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:42,130
This is when it gets a little too quirky.

1592
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:44,890
It gets a little crazy here.

1593
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:51,550
They get a little too excited about this whole game show that they're doing.

1594
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:52,510
No, no, no.

1595
01:09:52,610 --> 01:09:52,890
Not again.

1596
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,710
No, not again.

1597
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:54,230
Not again.

1598
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,950
No, not again.

1599
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,170
Don't do this to me.

1600
01:09:58,230 --> 01:09:58,770
Not again.

1601
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:00,490
No, no, no.

1602
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:01,750
That's the yellow prick.

1603
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:05,870
Not the yellow- Did you think I cared about the yellow push?

1604
01:10:05,870 --> 01:10:06,650
I'm trying to survive!

1605
01:10:08,610 --> 01:10:09,350
We did it.

1606
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:09,990
We did it.

1607
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:10,330
Stop.

1608
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:13,010
Alright, nice.

1609
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:14,270
We did it.

1610
01:10:14,350 --> 01:10:17,130
He fucking cares about the bunny plushie!

1611
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,410
I care, doki.

1612
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,090
I care.

1613
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,170
Oh my god.

1614
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:27,330
Okay, I thought I was dead.

1615
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:28,450
I was a missile.

1616
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:29,190
It was over.

1617
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:31,250
Explore.

1618
01:10:31,330 --> 01:10:32,750
Oh, thank god for exploring.

1619
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,650
Okay, nice.

1620
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:38,270
Okay.

1621
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:39,150
Good.

1622
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,570
It's just- You know what?

1623
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:44,910
I'm gonna- I'm gonna rebind something real fast.

1624
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:46,830
Oh.

1625
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:47,870
Oh, okay.

1626
01:10:48,310 --> 01:10:48,950
Oh, okay.

1627
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,550
That's cool.

1628
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,990
That's cool.

1629
01:10:51,350 --> 01:10:52,550
Fucking- Oh, okay.

1630
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:53,150
You know what?

1631
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:54,830
Left mouse- Oh my gosh.

1632
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:55,150
Okay.

1633
01:10:55,930 --> 01:10:56,850
Alright, that's good.

1634
01:10:56,970 --> 01:10:59,990
There's no- Wait, then what do I grab, though?

1635
01:11:01,950 --> 01:11:02,790
You know what?

1636
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:06,090
There's no way anything is on the right mouse button, right?

1637
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,250
There's- Oh, there is.

1638
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:08,230
It's the PewDieDuck.

1639
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:09,190
God damn it.

1640
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:11,030
What do I- Oh my god.

1641
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:12,190
I need something easier.

1642
01:11:12,370 --> 01:11:16,590
I can't- Okay, maybe this would be easier.

1643
01:11:16,690 --> 01:11:16,890
Maybe.

1644
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:17,970
It could be easier.

1645
01:11:19,570 --> 01:11:21,230
We're exploring, so...

1646
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:25,270
Yeah, it's- That's much more easy.

1647
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,590
That's definitely a lot more easier than left click.

1648
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:33,070
Oh my god.

1649
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,190
Why is it so far down?

1650
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,330
I wanted to use my mouse- Wait.

1651
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,950
Am I supposed to be here?

1652
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:40,930
Oh, fuck.

1653
01:11:40,990 --> 01:11:41,810
I'm committed now.

1654
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:43,890
Waste incinerator.

1655
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:47,650
Why is this- Why am I so tiny in this world?

1656
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:48,590
Oh, hey.

1657
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,650
There he is.

1658
01:11:53,090 --> 01:11:54,870
Whoa, there I go.

1659
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:55,450
Whoa!

1660
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,490
I feel so safe.

1661
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:03,530
Okay.

1662
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,450
Do again.

1663
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,150
We go again.

1664
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:07,010
Yippee!

1665
01:12:07,010 --> 01:12:07,390
Yippee!

1666
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:08,490
Rollercoaster!

1667
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,970
There's no pressure here.

1668
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,790
See?

1669
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:18,150
No pressure at all.

1670
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:20,470
We just press the buttons.

1671
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:22,530
Right?

1672
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:25,390
Just...

1673
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,050
Just press the funny buttons.

1674
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:34,980
Just...

1675
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:36,080
Where do I go?

1676
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:37,820
Do I just do a flip?

1677
01:12:37,860 --> 01:12:38,440
Do I jump?

1678
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,260
When do I jump?

1679
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,360
It'll be so funny.

1680
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,430
It's on the other side?

1681
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:48,650
I guess it is.

1682
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:49,590
It has to be, right?

1683
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:52,810
I fucked up.

1684
01:12:57,590 --> 01:13:00,690
I fucking- This is where I fucked up.

1685
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,070
Really?

1686
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:01,910
Really?

1687
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:12,170
I have to do it all over again.

1688
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:16,770
I have to do it all over again.

1689
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:18,450
Holy shit.

1690
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:21,710
I can't- I can't believe it.

1691
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:24,610
I did the simplest thing.

1692
01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:28,650
And then- Alright.

1693
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:29,810
Alright.

1694
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:31,410
Here we go again.

1695
01:13:32,230 --> 01:13:33,610
I just enjoyed it.

1696
01:13:33,710 --> 01:13:35,910
It was just too easy, you know, guys?

1697
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,270
Oh, I don't have to do it again.

1698
01:13:39,310 --> 01:13:41,150
Oh, thank fucking god.

1699
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,970
I don't have to do that again.

1700
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:46,110
Holy shit.

1701
01:13:46,710 --> 01:13:48,750
I was gonna be like, that would be so sad.

1702
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:51,710
That would be so sad.

1703
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:54,230
I have to do that all over again.

1704
01:13:56,190 --> 01:13:56,870
Alright.

1705
01:13:57,690 --> 01:13:58,630
Here we go.

1706
01:13:59,090 --> 01:13:59,490
Frankie.

1707
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:01,070
Hello, Frankie.

1708
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:02,730
Hello.

1709
01:14:05,450 --> 01:14:06,130
Frankie.

1710
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:06,290
Frankie.

1711
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:10,730
Have a fun time with Doki and the Dragoons.

1712
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,490
It's gonna be a really fun time.

1713
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:16,210
You know, murder doesn't have to be involved, Frankie.

1714
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:21,830
If you keep murdering people, then you're gonna run out of contestants.

1715
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:25,690
I don't like this long fucking back doors hallway.

1716
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,410
It's making me a little nervous.

1717
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,930
This is in- Oh my god.

1718
01:14:33,930 --> 01:14:36,670
This reminds me of the back rooms.

1719
01:14:39,570 --> 01:14:40,150
Exit?

1720
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,770
Is this where I came from?

1721
01:14:43,670 --> 01:14:45,110
Oh, this is where I came from.

1722
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:48,630
Yeah, this is like the back room shit right here.

1723
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:52,930
Oh, follow the- Oh, hey Frankie.

1724
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:55,870
Oh hey, you don't look evil.

1725
01:14:58,990 --> 01:14:59,570
Hi.

1726
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,590
You have a smiling face.

1727
01:15:03,930 --> 01:15:05,390
That's a good face.

1728
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:06,730
Hello?

1729
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:09,510
Yeah?

1730
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:16,010
Oh, it's you!

1731
01:15:35,780 --> 01:15:37,280
The cops are here?

1732
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,210
Wait, is that me?

1733
01:15:43,810 --> 01:15:44,470
Am I famous?

1734
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,710
Can I have a pizza?

1735
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:54,450
Wait.

1736
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,250
Can I have a family sized pizza?

1737
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,180
What does it say?

1738
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,000
Invite her alive.

1739
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:06,580
Oh, that's me!

1740
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,340
Keep alive until the very end.

1741
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:11,580
Terminate at- I'm Frankie!

1742
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,220
Wait, I'm- Oh no, you're Frankie!

1743
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,840
Oh, I'm me!

1744
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:19,400
Game show number 57.

1745
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,780
Wait, but what if I go here?

1746
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,160
Where does the blue go?

1747
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:24,400
Wait, where are the cops?

1748
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:26,440
How did they not found me yet?

1749
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,940
What if I just take this?

1750
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,260
Oh, why did I take that?

1751
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:34,720
Okay.

1752
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,920
Alright, I'm back here.

1753
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,000
Alright, I'm gonna go back.

1754
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:40,440
No!

1755
01:16:43,980 --> 01:16:44,500
No!

1756
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,800
Why did I take that?

1757
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,640
Back at it again.

1758
01:16:55,140 --> 01:16:57,020
Back at it again.

1759
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,660
I love- Guys, I just really love this particular area.

1760
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,840
It's like snake.

1761
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:04,860
Guys, it's like snake.

1762
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:07,820
Guys, I just really enjoy that one area.

1763
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,940
No, now I need to figure out how to get to that guy again.

1764
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:12,320
It was right there.

1765
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,940
The elevator was literally right there.

1766
01:17:17,380 --> 01:17:20,200
There were arrows pointing to it, chat!

1767
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:23,220
You would have done the- There were arrows.

1768
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,720
You don't understand.

1769
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:29,520
I saw an arrow and I was like- Woah, I wanna fucking go there.

1770
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,200
It looked so fun.

1771
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:34,360
You would have done the same thing.

1772
01:17:34,540 --> 01:17:36,020
You saw the arrows.

1773
01:17:39,100 --> 01:17:40,160
Alright, nice.

1774
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:41,220
Alright, here I'll go.

1775
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,580
Time to take the elevator.

1776
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,850
Unlock the trampoline and waterpark elevator door?

1777
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:51,530
Yeah?

1778
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:01,480
Find the trampoline and waterpark breakers.

1779
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:02,640
Oh.

1780
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:03,620
Oh.

1781
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:05,540
Oh.

1782
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,120
It's- Oh.

1783
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:08,300
Oh!

1784
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:09,820
Oh.

1785
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,320
Oh.

1786
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,560
Y'all know how we feel now.

1787
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:27,860
There's only one emotion for this.

1788
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:31,460
It's just- Oh.

1789
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:35,340
No.

1790
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,200
Not water level.

1791
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,680
What else could it be?

1792
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,820
Not this?

1793
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,180
It's not the thing that says danger?

1794
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,420
Oh, it's this!

1795
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,840
I don't see shit.

1796
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:56,150
Can I do it?

1797
01:18:59,410 --> 01:19:00,430
Oh no.

1798
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:02,390
Oh.

1799
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:02,650
Oh!

1800
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:04,890
Oh.

1801
01:19:07,610 --> 01:19:09,750
Okay, here I'll go.

1802
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:11,970
We can unlock the checkpoint.

1803
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:14,630
You know what that means.

1804
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:20,530
He's gonna- He's gonna fucking- Karusha Kali dog me right here.

1805
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:23,310
Hello?

1806
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:27,730
Oh, hello.

1807
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:30,910
Who's that?

1808
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:34,250
Oh, that's evil Frankie.

1809
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:40,680
Oh, thanks good Frankie.

1810
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:43,270
Thanks, I really appreciate that.

1811
01:19:47,860 --> 01:19:49,540
Oh my god.

1812
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,000
What would I do without you, good Frankie?

1813
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:53,980
Yay!

1814
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,420
Yay!

1815
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,120
Yippee!

1816
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,720
I feel so safe!

1817
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:12,540
My good Frankie!

1818
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:16,520
Never felt so safe in my life!

1819
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:25,120
But what about- Oh my god.

1820
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,680
Okay, another one.

1821
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:37,390
I don't like that bad hat over there.

1822
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:42,110
Wait, where's the last breaker?

1823
01:20:42,110 --> 01:20:43,890
Oh my god, are you fucking serious?

1824
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:49,690
The last breaker is where the giant fucking hat is just being like, Hey everybody!

1825
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:53,790
Hey, want me to- I'm gonna fucking get ya!

1826
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,750
I'm gonna get ya!

1827
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:58,110
Are you serious?

1828
01:20:58,290 --> 01:21:01,090
Are you fucking- Oh my god, like, how?

1829
01:21:10,510 --> 01:21:11,950
Where do I go?

1830
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,910
Oh, it's here.

1831
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:14,950
Oh my god, it's here.

1832
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:18,310
Run, how?

1833
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:18,990
How?

1834
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:21,430
I was in the fucking water.

1835
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,170
Oh, whoops.

1836
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:33,770
Oh that's- I didn't know.

1837
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:38,130
Oh no.

1838
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,320
Hello?

1839
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:42,500
Hello?

1840
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:58,680
This- Is this gonna be the trampoline and water part?

1841
01:21:59,460 --> 01:22:04,180
This elevator music is too- It's too relaxing for where I'm going to.

1842
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,560
Oh hey, he got crushed.

1843
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:07,880
Lucky.

1844
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,060
He's free.

1845
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,100
He's- He's free now.

1846
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:17,040
Frankie's parkour palace, yay!

1847
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,680
Yay!

1848
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:24,260
I love parkour!

1849
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,360
I love parkour so much!

1850
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,100
Yay, parkour!

1851
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:36,620
Yippee!

1852
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,420
I love it so much!

1853
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,280
Okay.

1854
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:45,740
Where do I go?

1855
01:22:45,740 --> 01:22:47,520
Oh, it's down here.

1856
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:48,740
Stairs over here.

1857
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:50,540
Right?

1858
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:52,500
No?

1859
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:53,960
I assume it was down here.

1860
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:55,000
There's stairs here.

1861
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,760
What do we explore?

1862
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,020
I don't see any, like, holes.

1863
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,160
Guys, it's not Stockholm Syndrome.

1864
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,920
I love parkour so much.

1865
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:20,140
I just said, it's not Stockholm Syndrome.

1866
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,000
I just- I just love parkour so much.

1867
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:28,780
There's a lever?

1868
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:34,720
It's just- Oh, there's the fucking- GUYS, IT'S CAUSE IT'S RED!

1869
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:36,160
IT SHOULD BE YELLOW!

1870
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,640
OH SHIT!

1871
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,520
Oh no.

1872
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:40,460
Oh no.

1873
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:42,160
Oh no.

1874
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:43,740
How many hoops though?

1875
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:46,360
Oh my god, is this the last one?

1876
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:46,780
Oh my god.

1877
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:48,380
Not the hoop game.

1878
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:50,340
Catch the noob noobs?

1879
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:51,880
What the fuck's a noob noob?

1880
01:23:53,700 --> 01:23:54,200
Oh fuck!

1881
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,040
Get the noob noob!

1882
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:55,800
Get the noob noob!

1883
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,320
I got him!

1884
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,200
I got him!

1885
01:23:58,720 --> 01:23:59,280
Get the noob!

1886
01:23:59,860 --> 01:24:00,180
Okay.

1887
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:01,240
Get over here!

1888
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:01,680
Get over here!

1889
01:24:01,740 --> 01:24:01,960
Get over here!

1890
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:02,560
Stop crying!

1891
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:03,580
Get over here before I get you!

1892
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:04,800
Please!

1893
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:05,840
It's you or me!

1894
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:07,140
It's you or me!

1895
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,520
One of us has to die!

1896
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:12,800
STOP!

1897
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:14,160
Stop jumping!

1898
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,740
Where's the last one?

1899
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:17,120
Where is he?

1900
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,160
Where are you?

1901
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:20,660
Where's the last noob noob?

1902
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:21,920
Wait, where is he?

1903
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,420
Oh, jump for the wins!

1904
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:28,180
I didn't realize.

1905
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:29,360
I didn't realize.

1906
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,800
I was still trying to find noob noobs.

1907
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:33,820
I was still trying to find noob noobs.

1908
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,200
I- I- There you go.

1909
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:36,780
It's fine.

1910
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:38,640
Oh no, not the noob noobs again.

1911
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:40,180
Where the fuck are the noob noobs?

1912
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:42,940
Get over here.

1913
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,380
Get over here!

1914
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,420
No, get over here, noob noobs.

1915
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:49,080
It's you or me.

1916
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:50,960
That's fucking right.

1917
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:52,580
You got nowhere to go!

1918
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,300
What do you mean?

1919
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:58,580
Oh, there you are.

1920
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,200
No, no, no.

1921
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:02,560
NOOOOO!

1922
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:06,980
Did I get him?

1923
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:07,840
Did I get him?

1924
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,940
No, I didn't do it again!

1925
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,260
NOOOOO!

1926
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,860
We were so close!

1927
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,540
No way!

1928
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,040
No way!

1929
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:22,120
I literally- That's so fucked.

1930
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,320
I was literally, like, there.

1931
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:26,160
It was there.

1932
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,120
It was action.

1933
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:28,900
That's- I can't believe it.

1934
01:25:29,220 --> 01:25:31,300
Oh my god, this stupid noob noob.

1935
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,320
The worst part is they're just- They're just always bouncing.

1936
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,360
Get over here.

1937
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:39,420
That's fucking right.

1938
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:40,880
They're in a better place, guys.

1939
01:25:41,740 --> 01:25:44,020
Oh god, I wish that were me right now.

1940
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:48,720
Fucking crab.

1941
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:49,740
Get over here, noob noob.

1942
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:51,340
Get- get- STOP!

1943
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,800
Okay, rings, rings, rings, rings, rings.

1944
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:56,920
I can't fuck this up now.

1945
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:57,380
I'm reading.

1946
01:25:58,220 --> 01:25:59,120
I'm reading now.

1947
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:01,860
Oh my god.

1948
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:02,400
Please.

1949
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:04,100
Please.

1950
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,280
I'm not gonna cry.

1951
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:07,840
Please.

1952
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:11,040
I'm not okay.

1953
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,500
I don't- I don't do well in pressure.

1954
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:19,260
Where's the other one?

1955
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:20,520
Oh, there you are.

1956
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:21,760
There you are.

1957
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:22,640
I'm just gonna run.

1958
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,520
Where's the last one?

1959
01:26:25,540 --> 01:26:26,040
I see you.

1960
01:26:26,180 --> 01:26:26,880
I see you.

1961
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:27,780
I see you.

1962
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:28,600
Stop jumping.

1963
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:29,680
You think you can get away?

1964
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:30,920
Oh, thank god.

1965
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:31,900
Now the jumpsuit!

1966
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:32,320
I'm running!

1967
01:26:32,460 --> 01:26:32,920
I can't-

1968
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:37,820
It's okay.

1969
01:26:37,820 --> 01:26:38,340
It's okay.

1970
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:39,000
It's okay.

1971
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:40,960
One more ring.

1972
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,140
One more ring.

1973
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:44,540
No.

1974
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:45,140
No.

1975
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:46,660
No!

1976
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:03,450
Get out of this hell.

1977
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:06,470
Get out of this hell.

1978
01:27:07,610 --> 01:27:10,210
This is actually purgatory right now.

1979
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:19,710
I don't know what's wrong with me.

1980
01:27:19,830 --> 01:27:21,590
I don't know.

1981
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,990
This is actually purgatory.

1982
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:26,290
Get me out of here.

1983
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:31,010
He loves parkour so much.

1984
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:33,370
He gets emotional damage from it.

1985
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:34,310
Feels great.

1986
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:37,270
Thank you for the superchat.

1987
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:38,970
Oh my god.

1988
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:40,750
There's so much more noob noobs.

1989
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:42,430
Okay.

1990
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:43,210
Okay.

1991
01:27:43,230 --> 01:27:43,670
We're fine.

1992
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:47,350
We have a system, guys.

1993
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:50,470
We have a system.

1994
01:27:56,970 --> 01:27:58,150
Where are they?

1995
01:27:58,630 --> 01:27:59,670
You noob kids over here.

1996
01:28:00,610 --> 01:28:02,170
Get over- GET OVER HERE!

1997
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:04,090
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU!

1998
01:28:04,530 --> 01:28:05,830
I'M BRINGING YOU OUT OF YOUR MISERY!

1999
01:28:07,870 --> 01:28:08,510
Get over here.

2000
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:10,110
I see you.

2001
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:10,650
I see you.

2002
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:11,310
Get over here.

2003
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:15,850
I will fucking destroy the entire noob noob population if it's the last thing I do.

2004
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:20,090
There will no longer be any more noob noobs after this.

2005
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:22,630
Okay.

2006
01:28:23,790 --> 01:28:24,690
Alright, here we go.

2007
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:26,330
Here we go.

2008
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:27,750
There's more noob noobs.

2009
01:28:27,890 --> 01:28:29,070
There's actually more noob noobs.

2010
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:29,470
Come on.

2011
01:28:30,890 --> 01:28:31,570
Where is he?

2012
01:28:34,570 --> 01:28:35,590
God, where are you guys?

2013
01:28:35,670 --> 01:28:36,010
Get over here.

2014
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:36,330
Get over here.

2015
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:37,190
I'm only at 14 seconds.

2016
01:28:37,310 --> 01:28:38,350
GET OVER HERE AND SLAM IT AWAY!

2017
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:41,850
Where's the last noob noob?

2018
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:43,070
Noob noob!

2019
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:43,890
Noob noob!

2020
01:28:44,030 --> 01:28:44,610
Noob noob!

2021
01:28:44,670 --> 01:28:45,330
Where are you hiding?

2022
01:28:45,810 --> 01:28:46,490
Noob noob!

2023
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:47,640
Stop!

2024
01:28:48,450 --> 01:28:48,810
Stop!

2025
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:50,310
Stop!

2026
01:28:50,690 --> 01:28:50,790
Stop!

2027
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:52,630
Okay.

2028
01:28:53,310 --> 01:28:53,930
Run!

2029
01:28:54,990 --> 01:28:56,390
Run, noob noobs!

2030
01:28:56,530 --> 01:28:56,810
Run!

2031
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:59,970
I'll make sure they stop existing.

2032
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:02,110
What?

2033
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:03,110
Oh.

2034
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:08,330
It's the beginning to the end for the noob noobs.

2035
01:29:08,330 --> 01:29:09,490
Noob noob population.

2036
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:11,110
Don't worry, don't care.

2037
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:11,970
I believe in you.

2038
01:29:12,190 --> 01:29:14,370
I don't know why I do, but I...

2039
01:29:14,370 --> 01:29:16,430
I don't know why, but I do.

2040
01:29:16,890 --> 01:29:18,210
Thank you for the super chat.

2041
01:29:18,330 --> 01:29:19,110
Thank you, thank you.

2042
01:29:19,150 --> 01:29:21,030
At least somebody believes in me.

2043
01:29:21,610 --> 01:29:24,270
The noob at their final noob noob.

2044
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:26,810
Oh, I got the key.

2045
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,450
I did it.

2046
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:33,010
I did it.

2047
01:29:35,210 --> 01:29:35,730
Oh.

2048
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:39,170
They're gone.

2049
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:40,670
I defeated the evil.

2050
01:29:42,230 --> 01:29:43,850
I guess I go on this side, right?

2051
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:47,130
This has to be Waterworld, right?

2052
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:53,120
This has to be a different area.

2053
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:54,660
Yay!

2054
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:55,740
Waterflow!

2055
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,480
Waterworld!

2056
01:29:58,780 --> 01:29:59,400
Yay!

2057
01:30:01,700 --> 01:30:03,620
That looks so sanitary.

2058
01:30:03,980 --> 01:30:04,560
Yeah, see?

2059
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,060
We're at the beach.

2060
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,380
Yay!

2061
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:09,860
Waterworld!

2062
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:12,280
Woohoo!

2063
01:30:14,260 --> 01:30:15,620
Is there water in Waterworld?

2064
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:22,150
Oh my god, there's five?

2065
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,830
Oh my god, but...

2066
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:26,230
Two.

2067
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:28,430
How do I get to five?

2068
01:30:29,310 --> 01:30:29,890
Three.

2069
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:32,490
Where's the last two?

2070
01:30:34,210 --> 01:30:35,970
Oh my god, where's the last two?

2071
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:39,190
This is out of order!

2072
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,200
How do I...

2073
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,520
Oh, it's the other side, it's the other side.

2074
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:47,380
It's right there.

2075
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:48,600
How do I get there?

2076
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:49,480
How do I get there?

2077
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:56,740
Four.

2078
01:30:57,540 --> 01:30:58,440
How do I get there?

2079
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:07,900
I don't understand.

2080
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,140
Now I'm here.

2081
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:15,520
Yay!

2082
01:31:16,540 --> 01:31:17,880
Put your hands in the air.

2083
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:20,500
I'm sorry, close your eyes.

2084
01:31:20,500 --> 01:31:23,880
Holy fuck, what the...

2085
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:29,200
Oh my god, okay, we're never doing that again.

2086
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,940
We're never...

2087
01:31:30,940 --> 01:31:32,760
We're never doing that again.

2088
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:35,340
We need to figure out how to get there.

2089
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:38,400
Is it here?

2090
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:41,500
If I fly to...

2091
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,200
Can I fly there?

2092
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,100
It's like...

2093
01:31:48,100 --> 01:31:49,900
It's the trampolines.

2094
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,320
You're right, you're supposed to...

2095
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:55,160
Actually, you're actually supposed to keep your hands down.

2096
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,280
Or you're like an effect of physics and you're gonna fly off.

2097
01:31:58,540 --> 01:31:59,580
And you'll fear a lot.

2098
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,160
How do I get there?

2099
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,360
Like, it's clearly the trampoline, but it's like, how?

2100
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
How do I get up top there?

2101
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:16,580
Like, it's that switch right here.

2102
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:17,900
Oh.

2103
01:32:18,860 --> 01:32:19,360
No?

2104
01:32:22,460 --> 01:32:22,920
Oh!

2105
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:26,480
Wait.

2106
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:28,800
Wait a minute.

2107
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,080
Wait a minute.

2108
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,080
Three.

2109
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:36,460
Wait, does that mean that one was, like, not related?

2110
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,280
Oh, it wasn't.

2111
01:32:40,220 --> 01:32:41,100
The fuck?

2112
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:42,860
They were unrelated to each other?

2113
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:44,640
Where's the last one?

2114
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:46,320
I already forgot where the last one was.

2115
01:32:46,580 --> 01:32:47,600
Wait, where's the last one?

2116
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:51,020
Wait, wait, where's the last one?

2117
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:52,300
I don't remember!

2118
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:55,360
I don't wanna call a monster any...

2119
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:55,980
Oh, hey, a bunny.

2120
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:02,560
I don't remember, there's too many.

2121
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:09,000
There's too many, there's too many swatches and I get confused and then I get confused and I'm sad.

2122
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:13,800
It makes me sad and confused.

2123
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:14,700
Confused.

2124
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,720
Oh my god, how do I get lost?

2125
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:19,740
How do I...

2126
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:21,720
Three.

2127
01:33:23,160 --> 01:33:23,520
Okay.

2128
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,940
We gotta hit the...

2129
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:28,420
We gotta hit the pole thing, we gotta hit this.

2130
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:30,600
There we go.

2131
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:32,820
How did I miss?

2132
01:33:34,280 --> 01:33:35,360
How did I miss?

2133
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,240
Okay.

2134
01:33:39,240 --> 01:33:39,840
Okay.

2135
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,640
There's one here, where's the last one then?

2136
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:52,900
Where's the last one?

2137
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:54,980
What?

2138
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:56,320
I...

2139
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:57,200
Okay.

2140
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:04,680
Okay, guys.

2141
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:06,100
Guys, I can do this.

2142
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:08,320
I can do this.

2143
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,060
There's three?

2144
01:34:11,020 --> 01:34:12,600
Where's the last one?

2145
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,140
It's on the bucket?

2146
01:34:18,140 --> 01:34:19,200
I see...

2147
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:22,040
I see it!

2148
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,900
I see it too!

2149
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,900
Okay, I figured it out, guys.

2150
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:27,700
I figured it out.

2151
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:29,020
I figured it out.

2152
01:34:29,460 --> 01:34:30,860
Guys, I figured it out.

2153
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,580
Watch this.

2154
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:40,020
Please, please, you're right there.

2155
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:42,960
Please!

2156
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,420
Please, how do I...

2157
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:46,800
Please, you were right there.

2158
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:48,960
You were literally right there.

2159
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:50,860
Okay.

2160
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:51,900
Two.

2161
01:34:53,160 --> 01:34:54,980
I love parkour so much.

2162
01:34:56,460 --> 01:35:01,340
Parkour is my favorite type of gameplay in the whole wide world.

2163
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,120
And you know what?

2164
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:04,440
I think...

2165
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,320
I think more games should have parkour.

2166
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:12,520
Okay.

2167
01:35:12,980 --> 01:35:14,080
We activated the fan.

2168
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:15,760
So it should be this fan.

2169
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,320
Where do I fly to?

2170
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,880
Oh, it has to be here.

2171
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:30,780
And then what?

2172
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,320
Here?

2173
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:37,460
Wait, what?

2174
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:41,570
Oh!

2175
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:42,470
Wait, no.

2176
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:43,190
No.

2177
01:35:44,710 --> 01:35:47,350
I did it, but like, where's the other one?

2178
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:53,420
I'm looking up.

2179
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,760
Where's the other one?

2180
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,240
Are you fucking serious?

2181
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,650
How do I...

2182
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:06,480
How?

2183
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:10,940
How do I even...

2184
01:36:10,940 --> 01:36:11,820
Oh my god.

2185
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:12,640
Oh, it's this.

2186
01:36:13,660 --> 01:36:18,070
I can't even reach it!

2187
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:21,130
How do you even reach that?

2188
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:24,010
That's how.

2189
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:27,190
Oh my god.

2190
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:30,350
Oh my god, okay.

2191
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:32,250
Okay, that one was bullshit.

2192
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:34,130
That one was actually...

2193
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:37,750
Oh no, I can't even do this!

2194
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:39,050
It's okay, I can.

2195
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:41,010
JK, I was just testing you guys.

2196
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:42,350
There we go.

2197
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:44,810
Another fan has been...

2198
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:45,750
Where's the next fan?

2199
01:36:45,810 --> 01:36:46,470
Oh, it's over here.

2200
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:50,510
This has to be the other fans.

2201
01:36:51,970 --> 01:36:52,570
Oh.

2202
01:36:54,030 --> 01:36:55,230
It's like...

2203
01:36:55,230 --> 01:36:55,470
What?

2204
01:36:55,930 --> 01:36:57,690
They made zero sound!

2205
01:36:58,790 --> 01:36:59,090
Okay.

2206
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:00,630
Alright.

2207
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:02,650
Oh thank god, I don't have to do that again.

2208
01:37:04,410 --> 01:37:05,930
Oh thank god.

2209
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:11,240
To the meet grinder I go.

2210
01:37:13,700 --> 01:37:15,900
Oh my god, I have to go from here.

2211
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,200
This way.

2212
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,820
I got baited so hard.

2213
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:25,420
Oh my god, I fucking...

2214
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:25,740
How?

2215
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:40,820
I even did that in slow-mo too!

2216
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:42,820
Wee!

2217
01:37:48,460 --> 01:37:50,800
I'm just a little special.

2218
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:51,660
Alright.

2219
01:37:54,620 --> 01:37:55,020
How?

2220
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:55,860
Okay.

2221
01:37:58,560 --> 01:37:59,260
Wee!

2222
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:00,140
Okay.

2223
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:01,820
Oh my god, it's like...

2224
01:38:02,540 --> 01:38:04,000
It's like that doctor...

2225
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:08,620
It's like that doctor game where you can't touch the corner.

2226
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:12,360
No, it's like that Neopets game where you have to follow the stick.

2227
01:38:12,460 --> 01:38:14,160
If you don't, it makes the bzzz sound.

2228
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:15,960
Oh my god.

2229
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:25,410
There we go.

2230
01:38:25,670 --> 01:38:26,610
We did it.

2231
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:27,730
We did it, team.

2232
01:38:30,190 --> 01:38:32,730
On the fucking mystery island.

2233
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:35,050
I know, you're like...

2234
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:39,030
Doki, only 5% of your chat understands that reference.

2235
01:38:39,610 --> 01:38:40,290
Doki, only...

2236
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:47,310
Doki, only 5% of your chat understands what that means.

2237
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:53,190
Oh, there's another cereal box.

2238
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,290
Oh, that's the other key!

2239
01:38:57,650 --> 01:38:59,290
I got the other key now.

2240
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:00,790
To open Frankie Mountain?

2241
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:02,130
Wait, where's Frankie Mountain?

2242
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:07,890
Where's Frankie Mountain?

2243
01:39:16,210 --> 01:39:17,650
Oh, lower everything?

2244
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:18,190
Okay.

2245
01:39:23,130 --> 01:39:27,350
Alright, we boost the game up a little more.

2246
01:39:28,150 --> 01:39:29,590
Alright, that should be good.

2247
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:33,470
Where's Frankie Mountain?

2248
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:35,190
There's the water slide.

2249
01:39:36,650 --> 01:39:38,170
Oh, there's Frankie Mountain!

2250
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:42,330
That should be Frankie Mountain.

2251
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:48,610
Me?!

2252
01:39:51,690 --> 01:39:52,130
Me?!

2253
01:40:02,510 --> 01:40:03,870
I'm just a fanfic!

2254
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:04,750
I'm so relatable!

2255
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:06,230
What can I say?

2256
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:09,690
Wait, what?

2257
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:13,090
Wait, this is all scripted?

2258
01:40:18,890 --> 01:40:20,390
There's no way!

2259
01:40:20,730 --> 01:40:24,130
A reality TV show is supposed to be about reality, Henry Hotline!

2260
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:38,720
No!

2261
01:40:42,480 --> 01:40:43,620
They were gonna gradually...

2262
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:45,820
Sorry.

2263
01:40:47,220 --> 01:40:48,580
Too relevant?

2264
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,000
No!

2265
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:53,320
Not my Oshi!

2266
01:41:08,310 --> 01:41:11,550
Don't worry, it's gonna reincarnate, guys!

2267
01:41:14,670 --> 01:41:18,590
Guys, it's gonna reincarnate, right?

2268
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:20,390
It's gonna come back, right?

2269
01:41:24,810 --> 01:41:25,590
Guys!

2270
01:41:26,370 --> 01:41:27,690
Right, guys?

2271
01:41:28,150 --> 01:41:30,790
It's not gonna disappear forever!

2272
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:41,510
I'm not supposed to go this way?

2273
01:41:41,630 --> 01:41:42,770
I thought this was the mountain.

2274
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:56,470
You okay?

2275
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:56,670
You okay?

2276
01:41:59,630 --> 01:42:00,290
Alright,

2277
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:04,510
see?

2278
01:42:04,830 --> 01:42:05,510
He's okay!

2279
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:07,130
We still have Deputy Duck!

2280
01:42:07,890 --> 01:42:08,970
My Kami Oshi!

2281
01:42:11,570 --> 01:42:12,230
Is that alright?

2282
01:42:14,590 --> 01:42:15,950
No, he's okay, guys!

2283
01:42:16,010 --> 01:42:16,490
He's okay!

2284
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,670
What?

2285
01:42:23,480 --> 01:42:24,780
What did I do?

2286
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:25,020
What did I do?

2287
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:28,780
It's not the same!

2288
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:34,440
I thought I had to go here.

2289
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,240
Use both keys to open the door.

2290
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:39,220
I did, though!

2291
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:41,600
Did I not use both keys?

2292
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,540
This is... That's the key!

2293
01:42:48,100 --> 01:42:49,420
Don't worry, Toki!

2294
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:55,720
I heard there was this cool new mascot named Henry Cellphone about to debut!

2295
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,860
Superchat, thank you!

2296
01:42:58,920 --> 01:42:59,940
Thank you, fudge!

2297
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:03,240
That's the door!

2298
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,160
How can there be another door?

2299
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:10,530
Is there another door I missed?

2300
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:12,190
Wait, does he quack?

2301
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:13,230
We'll find out.

2302
01:43:21,540 --> 01:43:22,960
That's literally the door!

2303
01:43:33,040 --> 01:43:34,120
Is it not this door?

2304
01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:40,850
Did I miss the wrong one?

2305
01:43:47,500 --> 01:43:49,060
Yeah, that's the mountain!

2306
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:52,000
Hey, Frankie!

2307
01:43:53,220 --> 01:43:53,760
Hey!

2308
01:43:56,940 --> 01:43:58,120
Was it a crouch?

2309
01:44:01,420 --> 01:44:03,240
Oh, maybe I had to crouch.

2310
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:04,960
Maybe.

2311
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,840
I thought it was fully closed.

2312
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:12,900
Yeah, no, I can't...

2313
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:14,520
I can't go there.

2314
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:17,600
I thought

2315
01:44:21,660 --> 01:44:22,580
I got both keys!

2316
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:23,720
I got both keys!

2317
01:44:26,060 --> 01:44:27,580
Where else do I go?

2318
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:33,700
I'm lost, guys.

2319
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,040
My Oshie died.

2320
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:38,660
My Oshie graduated, so now I don't know what to do.

2321
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:44,220
I don't know what to do anymore.

2322
01:44:55,540 --> 01:45:00,360
I guess my Kami Oshie right here might not be the same.

2323
01:45:00,740 --> 01:45:04,240
She doesn't have the same joy, but that's okay, you're still here!

2324
01:45:06,900 --> 01:45:09,720
I'm just gonna be stuck here!

2325
01:45:12,780 --> 01:45:14,880
Alright, go somewhere else.

2326
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:16,560
I skipped something?

2327
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:17,760
What did I skip?

2328
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,960
I did Waterworld!

2329
01:45:30,060 --> 01:45:32,300
Oh, is that the incinerator?

2330
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:37,180
Alright, back to... back to Frankie!

2331
01:45:40,660 --> 01:45:41,460
I'm blind.

2332
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:42,960
I'm blind as fucking hell.

2333
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:44,140
Alright, goodbye.

2334
01:45:47,500 --> 01:45:52,740
I swear to god, if it's not the incinerator and I fucking went all this way for no reason...

2335
01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:54,100
I swear to god.

2336
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,820
Maybe it's like...

2337
01:45:56,820 --> 01:45:59,300
Oh my god, I swear to god, if I get one guide...

2338
01:46:03,060 --> 01:46:04,180
I swear to god.

2339
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:06,500
I literally grabbed both keys, guys.

2340
01:46:09,860 --> 01:46:14,540
There's a waterpark lever that I didn't...

2341
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:15,520
I do here?

2342
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,640
Oh, that has to be it, right?

2343
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,320
I'm a star!

2344
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:31,360
He's gonna die.

2345
01:46:31,460 --> 01:46:32,620
No way he makes it.

2346
01:46:32,680 --> 01:46:34,180
He doesn't make it past Hexa.

2347
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:35,740
Oh, that's you guys!

2348
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:37,860
That's...

2349
01:46:37,860 --> 01:46:39,820
Why are you guys anonymous, you fucking cowards?

2350
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:41,100
That's you!

2351
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,500
Two Frankies?

2352
01:46:42,780 --> 01:46:42,980
What?

2353
01:46:43,180 --> 01:46:43,520
How?

2354
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,000
Oh my god, chat's real!

2355
01:46:47,540 --> 01:46:48,980
I knew you guys were real.

2356
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:49,780
I knew it.

2357
01:46:50,480 --> 01:46:52,400
You guys kept telling me, take my meds.

2358
01:46:52,460 --> 01:46:53,960
When I take my meds, you guys disappear.

2359
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,380
This contestant is boring, bro!

2360
01:47:00,100 --> 01:47:02,700
Fucking fuck you, whoever you are!

2361
01:47:02,700 --> 01:47:04,360
Hiding behind anonymous?

2362
01:47:04,600 --> 01:47:05,260
Reveal yourself!

2363
01:47:05,740 --> 01:47:06,240
Talk to yourself!

2364
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:06,820
No, shit.

2365
01:47:13,300 --> 01:47:14,280
Oh, I did it.

2366
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:14,880
It's right here.

2367
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:16,880
So true, chat.

2368
01:47:19,220 --> 01:47:20,180
Very nice.

2369
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:23,740
That's fun, that guy.

2370
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:29,520
Alright.

2371
01:47:29,700 --> 01:47:30,180
Oh, hey!

2372
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,140
What?

2373
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:36,940
Is that my heartbeat?

2374
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:38,720
Oh, I don't like that.

2375
01:47:38,900 --> 01:47:39,600
I don't like that.

2376
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:42,120
I don't like my heartbeat going so...

2377
01:47:42,120 --> 01:47:42,320
Oh!

2378
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,400
19,000 people!

2379
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,640
Hey, guys!

2380
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:50,220
Hey, what's up?

2381
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:52,920
Today, we are gonna do the support core challenge.

2382
01:47:53,340 --> 01:47:54,260
Oh my god!

2383
01:47:55,060 --> 01:47:57,220
19k people are watching me!

2384
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:01,340
Time to get the crown.

2385
01:48:04,100 --> 01:48:06,100
This is the worst that can happen.

2386
01:48:08,420 --> 01:48:10,100
No monsters here, anyway.

2387
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:11,880
Yeah!

2388
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,240
We're going viral!

2389
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,240
Hardcore ahead.

2390
01:48:20,900 --> 01:48:21,500
Oh my god, guys.

2391
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:22,300
We're going viral.

2392
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:24,240
We're going fucking viral, guys.

2393
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:28,380
Wait, do we do it?

2394
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:33,480
Where are we supposed to go?

2395
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:35,200
Wait, was that not the part?

2396
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:39,460
Oh, this was the parkour part!

2397
01:48:39,660 --> 01:48:39,780
Whoops.

2398
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,460
That was just the beginning.

2399
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:43,720
Okay, guys, remember to put your shoes away.

2400
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:46,480
Alright.

2401
01:48:47,500 --> 01:48:48,280
Let's go.

2402
01:48:51,540 --> 01:48:52,800
Escape the slide?

2403
01:48:53,640 --> 01:48:54,200
Where?

2404
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:56,460
Oh my god, wait.

2405
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,100
Wait.

2406
01:48:57,540 --> 01:48:57,820
Wait.

2407
01:48:58,200 --> 01:48:59,700
No, I always...

2408
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:01,800
I always fuck up this part.

2409
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,940
Oh no.

2410
01:49:04,260 --> 01:49:05,160
Oh no.

2411
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,880
This is my worst Fall Guys map.

2412
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:09,640
This part.

2413
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:10,180
No!

2414
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:12,600
No!

2415
01:49:13,940 --> 01:49:14,220
No!

2416
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:18,440
Where's the slab?

2417
01:49:18,740 --> 01:49:19,480
Where's the slab?

2418
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:21,220
Okay, guys.

2419
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:21,940
Guys, it's okay.

2420
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:22,540
It's okay.

2421
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:24,440
We made a little...

2422
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:27,200
We made a little oopsie, but that's...

2423
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:28,760
No!

2424
01:49:33,930 --> 01:49:34,770
It's right here.

2425
01:49:34,910 --> 01:49:35,550
It's right here.

2426
01:49:35,750 --> 01:49:38,010
It's right here.

2427
01:49:38,430 --> 01:49:39,950
Oh, we just...

2428
01:49:39,950 --> 01:49:41,530
We made a little oopsie.

2429
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:42,250
I told you.

2430
01:49:42,350 --> 01:49:42,750
I told you.

2431
01:49:42,770 --> 01:49:43,530
This is my worst part.

2432
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:44,730
This is my worst Fall Guys map.

2433
01:49:44,810 --> 01:49:45,450
This is my worst one.

2434
01:49:46,710 --> 01:49:48,310
Don't touch me.

2435
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:54,290
That pity.

2436
01:49:57,470 --> 01:49:58,950
This is my worst...

2437
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:01,450
My worst Fall Guys map.

2438
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:03,670
I don't know why.

2439
01:50:03,870 --> 01:50:04,170
I just...

2440
01:50:04,170 --> 01:50:06,470
I don't know how to do this one.

2441
01:50:07,370 --> 01:50:08,450
It just...

2442
01:50:08,450 --> 01:50:10,390
My brain just can't comprehend.

2443
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:13,170
Oh my god.

2444
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:14,890
I don't know.

2445
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:18,390
No, my brain just doesn't register anything.

2446
01:50:18,730 --> 01:50:20,610
When it comes to the slip and slide.

2447
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:24,670
There's too many slips and too many slides.

2448
01:50:26,830 --> 01:50:27,550
It just...

2449
01:50:27,550 --> 01:50:29,490
It just fucks with me so much.

2450
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,430
You don't understand.

2451
01:50:33,010 --> 01:50:34,350
Oh my god.

2452
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:37,070
No, no, no.

2453
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:41,310
Oh, thank god.

2454
01:50:41,450 --> 01:50:43,170
Thank god there is a guy.

2455
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:45,150
Thank god.

2456
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:46,910
Help.

2457
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:48,010
Help.

2458
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:49,490
Help.

2459
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:54,150
Oh my god, please.

2460
01:50:55,130 --> 01:50:56,750
Please, it's right there.

2461
01:50:59,490 --> 01:50:59,790
Okay.

2462
01:51:00,690 --> 01:51:01,610
We're fine.

2463
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:02,670
It's just...

2464
01:51:02,670 --> 01:51:03,770
It's just this now.

2465
01:51:04,990 --> 01:51:06,010
It's not as bad.

2466
01:51:06,650 --> 01:51:08,110
This part is not bad.

2467
01:51:08,210 --> 01:51:09,370
This part is not bad.

2468
01:51:09,490 --> 01:51:10,730
We just gotta be patient.

2469
01:51:11,690 --> 01:51:13,370
We just gotta be patient, guys.

2470
01:51:18,650 --> 01:51:19,210
Okay.

2471
01:51:19,990 --> 01:51:23,950
It's gotta be...

2472
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:24,730
No.

2473
01:51:30,100 --> 01:51:30,660
Again.

2474
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:33,680
The slip and slide.

2475
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,880
I need... Okay.

2476
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:38,340
This might be the wrong time to tell you guys.

2477
01:51:38,440 --> 01:51:41,100
I've never got past this map in Fall Guys before.

2478
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,860
I always get eliminated.

2479
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:44,660
Like, is that a...

2480
01:51:44,660 --> 01:51:45,940
Is it noticeable?

2481
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,440
Like, can you guys tell?

2482
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:53,200
Can you guys tell that, like...

2483
01:51:53,200 --> 01:51:53,760
I might...

2484
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,500
That, like...

2485
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:01,760
I get...

2486
01:52:01,760 --> 01:52:04,340
This might not be my strongest map.

2487
01:52:05,340 --> 01:52:07,820
I don't know if that's noticeable or not.

2488
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:08,960
Is it that noticeable?

2489
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:13,020
Oh my god, please.

2490
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:13,940
Please.

2491
01:52:14,460 --> 01:52:15,500
Woah, woah, woah.

2492
01:52:19,540 --> 01:52:22,780
Okay, here we go.

2493
01:52:24,660 --> 01:52:25,380
Okay.

2494
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:27,160
Alright, slide.

2495
01:52:27,780 --> 01:52:28,240
Slide.

2496
01:52:29,380 --> 01:52:30,200
Okay, that's fine.

2497
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,140
Who told me to slide?

2498
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:49,140
We're gonna be on this map for...

2499
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:49,920
40 minutes.

2500
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:52,260
On this...

2501
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:55,580
This is literally the last parkour, I think.

2502
01:52:55,580 --> 01:52:58,640
They were saying like, woah, this is the last one.

2503
01:52:58,980 --> 01:53:00,600
This is the final act.

2504
01:53:03,220 --> 01:53:03,880
Alright.

2505
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:06,800
I don't know, my brain just...

2506
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,580
Can't register how to slide.

2507
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:11,000
How to slip inside.

2508
01:53:12,460 --> 01:53:12,720
Okay.

2509
01:53:13,620 --> 01:53:15,340
Okay, everything will be fine.

2510
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:16,980
Go.

2511
01:53:17,900 --> 01:53:18,420
Oh my.

2512
01:53:18,860 --> 01:53:19,180
Go.

2513
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:20,520
That's right.

2514
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:20,620
Okay.

2515
01:53:21,180 --> 01:53:21,520
Go.

2516
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:22,440
Oh my god.

2517
01:53:22,540 --> 01:53:24,180
I'm unlocking my third eye.

2518
01:53:25,860 --> 01:53:28,860
I'm unlocking my third parkour eye right here.

2519
01:53:29,420 --> 01:53:30,000
It's all...

2520
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:30,880
It's so over.

2521
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:32,920
Oh my god.

2522
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,540
I'm unlocking my potential.

2523
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:36,960
No slide.

2524
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:38,920
This is it.

2525
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:40,680
My true potential.

2526
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:42,360
I unlocked it.

2527
01:53:43,160 --> 01:53:45,620
I unlocked my parkour skill right here.

2528
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:47,740
How?

2529
01:53:49,220 --> 01:53:49,340
How?

2530
01:53:53,170 --> 01:53:53,830
Oh.

2531
01:53:54,350 --> 01:53:55,270
Yes.

2532
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:56,350
Woah.

2533
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:01,720
Gotta...

2534
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:02,780
Push this up.

2535
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:04,020
No.

2536
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:07,080
We gotta push this all the way up.

2537
01:54:07,420 --> 01:54:09,860
And then...

2538
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:10,120
Oh.

2539
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,500
That was so close.

2540
01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:13,820
This is it.

2541
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:16,520
This is it.

2542
01:54:16,520 --> 01:54:18,900
Just smash through.

2543
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:20,840
Okay.

2544
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:22,300
No pressure.

2545
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:22,840
No pressure.

2546
01:54:22,940 --> 01:54:23,140
Oh.

2547
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:27,920
Nice.

2548
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:29,780
Nice.

2549
01:54:30,620 --> 01:54:31,640
Regular parkour.

2550
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:33,860
No more slide.

2551
01:54:34,720 --> 01:54:35,440
Oh, woah.

2552
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:37,080
Woah.

2553
01:54:39,380 --> 01:54:42,140
This is a little too hardcore though.

2554
01:54:42,760 --> 01:54:43,200
Woah.

2555
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:44,000
Woah.

2556
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:45,080
Woah.

2557
01:54:45,860 --> 01:54:49,980
You guys make me chill a little bit.

2558
01:54:50,360 --> 01:54:50,860
Woah.

2559
01:54:51,080 --> 01:54:52,040
I went backwards?

2560
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:53,140
That's a...

2561
01:54:54,700 --> 01:54:56,220
I just...

2562
01:54:56,220 --> 01:54:58,820
I made progress backwards?

2563
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,380
It's fine.

2564
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:04,380
Okay.

2565
01:55:04,780 --> 01:55:05,440
It's okay.

2566
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:07,920
I was testing the water.

2567
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:09,900
I wanted...

2568
01:55:09,900 --> 01:55:11,740
I was trying to figure out the pattern, you know?

2569
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:12,820
But...

2570
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,000
That's it.

2571
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:17,480
I was just trying to figure out the pattern.

2572
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:19,320
Oh my god.

2573
01:55:19,340 --> 01:55:21,060
I don't keep accidentally going backwards!

2574
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:23,300
I...

2575
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:23,880
Okay.

2576
01:55:25,260 --> 01:55:25,900
Okay.

2577
01:55:27,100 --> 01:55:27,660
Alright.

2578
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:30,120
Oh my god.

2579
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,060
Please.

2580
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:32,340
Please!

2581
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,120
Where's the hole?!

2582
01:55:37,420 --> 01:55:38,400
Oh, there's the hole.

2583
01:55:38,740 --> 01:55:39,500
There's the hole.

2584
01:55:39,740 --> 01:55:41,100
Oh, there's the other hole.

2585
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:43,420
Oh my god, we made it.

2586
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:46,300
We made it to the hole.

2587
01:55:49,100 --> 01:55:49,540
Hello?

2588
01:55:50,960 --> 01:55:51,700
Oh, okay.

2589
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:53,820
Oh no, not the Hexahavoc.

2590
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,260
Didn't it say I was gonna die at the Hexahavoc?

2591
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:04,250
Wait, how do I make it to the...

2592
01:56:04,250 --> 01:56:05,950
Why am I not flying up?

2593
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:10,730
Wait, this is where I'm supposed to die, right?

2594
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:14,130
Hello?

2595
01:56:14,930 --> 01:56:15,670
Hello?

2596
01:56:17,710 --> 01:56:18,830
Good luck?

2597
01:56:19,890 --> 01:56:21,390
I don't need luck.

2598
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:25,690
All skill, baby.

2599
01:56:27,010 --> 01:56:27,410
Hello?

2600
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:29,890
Pumped your chosen?

2601
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:30,010
Pumped your chosen?

2602
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:38,580
I

2603
01:56:42,730 --> 01:56:44,130
don't like that.

2604
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:46,690
Oh fuck, no, not...

2605
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:47,910
This is Minecraft PTSD.

2606
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:52,310
Oh no.

2607
01:56:54,290 --> 01:56:56,350
We know what happened in Minecraft.

2608
01:56:57,010 --> 01:57:02,390
We know what happened in Minecraft!

2609
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:09,390
Oh, it's already happening!

2610
01:57:12,750 --> 01:57:14,330
It's already happening.

2611
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:17,130
It's already happening!

2612
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:39,770
It's happening!

2613
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:42,450
Wait, that's cheating!

2614
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,600
Wait!

2615
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:49,640
That's cheating!

2616
01:57:50,140 --> 01:57:51,820
He's actually cheating!

2617
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:55,260
What the fuck, there's new moves here?

2618
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:02,700
Oh shit!

2619
01:58:10,140 --> 01:58:12,440
What the fuck?

2620
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:15,540
Okay, okay.

2621
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,920
Okay, that's so bullshit!

2622
01:58:18,100 --> 01:58:20,640
He's like, he's like fucking off-track!

2623
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,420
He can jump!

2624
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:34,120
Oh my god, this is...

2625
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:35,780
This is so messed up.

2626
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:38,180
This is actually so messed up.

2627
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:39,440
This is...

2628
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:41,200
I can't, I can't!

2629
01:58:41,500 --> 01:58:42,600
This is the last square!

2630
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,180
This is literally the last square!

2631
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:54,900
There's no way.

2632
01:58:55,620 --> 01:58:56,180
There's...

2633
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,020
There's no way.

2634
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:38,080
Wait,

2635
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:42,780
can he kill me?

2636
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,080
Do I have to run away from him?

2637
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:46,040
Wait, can he kill me?

2638
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:49,280
I don't know if he can kill me.

2639
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:50,540
We'll find out now.

2640
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:52,480
We'll find out.

2641
01:59:54,940 --> 01:59:56,200
Oh, he can!

2642
01:59:58,060 --> 01:59:58,640
Okay.

2643
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:00,120
He can't kill me.

2644
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:04,460
Guys, I'm not gonna...

2645
02:00:07,150 --> 02:00:08,830
Guys, I'm not gonna test it.

2646
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:10,550
Guys, I'm not gonna...

2647
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:12,130
This stupid noob noob.

2648
02:00:12,530 --> 02:00:14,730
This actual stupid whore.

2649
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:16,890
Like...

2650
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:22,340
Get away from me!

2651
02:00:26,240 --> 02:00:27,960
This is not fair!

2652
02:00:42,010 --> 02:00:42,910
Oh my god.

2653
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:47,550
Oh my god.

2654
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:50,550
Get out, no no!

2655
02:00:50,990 --> 02:00:52,830
Get your ass outta here!

2656
02:01:00,830 --> 02:01:01,290
Oh my god.

2657
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,920
God damn it!

2658
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:11,400
I didn't think he was gonna catch me!

2659
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:17,440
Oh my god!

2660
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:20,100
So bullshit!

2661
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,400
The doodoos!

2662
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:24,240
I'm fucking...

2663
02:01:24,240 --> 02:01:25,660
Okay, he can't kill you.

2664
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:39,780
He got me in the corner!

2665
02:01:40,340 --> 02:01:41,320
He got me in the corner!

2666
02:01:41,320 --> 02:01:43,260
Oh my god!

2667
02:01:44,640 --> 02:01:46,360
It's not fair!

2668
02:01:46,500 --> 02:01:47,860
Guys, I'm only doing it for the views.

2669
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,280
Guys, if I...

2670
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:51,940
The more I die, the more...

2671
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:54,600
I'm gonna hit 50 concurrent viewers!

2672
02:01:54,940 --> 02:01:56,180
Guys, this is for the content!

2673
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:00,940
I'm just raising the ratings!

2674
02:02:01,240 --> 02:02:02,920
Guys, I'm just...

2675
02:02:02,920 --> 02:02:04,660
I'm raising the ratings.

2676
02:02:05,380 --> 02:02:07,320
Chat, it's for the ratings.

2677
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:08,440
You don't understand.

2678
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:09,040
Chat...

2679
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,860
Oh my god, get away from me!

2680
02:02:18,510 --> 02:02:19,930
Oh my god.

2681
02:02:20,510 --> 02:02:22,450
Like, it's so scary!

2682
02:02:28,340 --> 02:02:29,840
Are you fucking...

2683
02:02:29,840 --> 02:02:30,760
Oh my god.

2684
02:02:40,690 --> 02:02:42,770
You're such a whore!

2685
02:02:56,540 --> 02:02:57,500
Fuck!

2686
02:03:11,020 --> 02:03:11,920
I hate him.

2687
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:12,500
I hate him.

2688
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:16,060
I hate him so much.

2689
02:03:16,760 --> 02:03:17,700
I hate him.

2690
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:19,300
I hate him.

2691
02:03:19,540 --> 02:03:20,200
I hate him.

2692
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:23,380
This fucking sucks.

2693
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:24,280
It's so over.

2694
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:27,300
It's actually so over.

2695
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,980
He's up there just having the time of his life right now.

2696
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:39,880
He's having...

2697
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:42,800
Are you serious?

2698
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:50,060
That's actually bullshit!

2699
02:03:50,940 --> 02:03:52,300
Oh my god!

2700
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,020
He like, landed on top of me.

2701
02:03:57,160 --> 02:03:58,120
So I put X...

2702
02:03:58,580 --> 02:03:59,860
Oh my god.

2703
02:04:16,520 --> 02:04:17,320
No!

2704
02:04:34,590 --> 02:04:36,190
I made a...

2705
02:04:36,190 --> 02:04:38,290
I made a beef jump!

2706
02:04:38,610 --> 02:04:39,830
I jumped for the beef!

2707
02:04:40,110 --> 02:04:41,690
I jumped for the beef!

2708
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:45,990
I did it!

2709
02:04:46,290 --> 02:04:47,870
I got the beef!

2710
02:04:50,650 --> 02:04:52,370
Bye, Noob News.

2711
02:04:52,370 --> 02:04:53,090
Noob News.

2712
02:04:57,880 --> 02:04:59,480
Oh my god.

2713
02:05:12,250 --> 02:05:13,790
I didn't know that would work.

2714
02:05:14,290 --> 02:05:15,510
I put it all in.

2715
02:05:16,230 --> 02:05:17,310
Oh my god, we did.

2716
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:18,870
Wait, do I die with him?

2717
02:05:19,330 --> 02:05:20,010
For the ratings.

2718
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:26,020
I did it for the ratings.

2719
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:29,460
I'm gonna die famous now.

2720
02:05:33,180 --> 02:05:35,460
For the content.

2721
02:05:36,280 --> 02:05:37,820
Remember me.

2722
02:05:40,260 --> 02:05:42,180
We did it.

2723
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:45,780
We broke 20k concurrent viewers.

2724
02:05:50,170 --> 02:05:52,030
It was good.

2725
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:52,770
It's fine.

2726
02:05:53,990 --> 02:05:56,870
I freed myself from parkour.

2727
02:05:59,710 --> 02:06:01,070
Who's that?

2728
02:06:01,810 --> 02:06:03,370
Wait, that's me.

2729
02:06:03,370 --> 02:06:04,110
That's me.

2730
02:06:04,670 --> 02:06:06,110
Wait, I lived?

2731
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:19,830
Oh my god, biggest fucking plot twist.

2732
02:06:19,950 --> 02:06:21,270
I actually lived.

2733
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:24,010
Wait, what?

2734
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:33,560
What happened?

2735
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:35,900
Did I break the game?

2736
02:06:38,620 --> 02:06:41,400
In my final breath...

2737
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,040
I broke the game.

2738
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,200
It just stopped.

2739
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:51,980
It just...

2740
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:54,200
Are you sure the game wasn't the first person?

2741
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:57,340
Thank you for the super chat.

2742
02:06:57,500 --> 02:07:00,080
In my final breath...

2743
02:07:00,080 --> 02:07:01,280
The game broke.

2744
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:03,180
No.

2745
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,580
It's just that.

2746
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:06,840
That's it.

2747
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:10,080
What's going on?

2748
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:14,480
I don't...

2749
02:07:14,940 --> 02:07:15,360
Hello?

2750
02:07:18,500 --> 02:07:19,340
Oh!

2751
02:07:19,480 --> 02:07:21,180
Oh, hey!

2752
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:23,020
It's me!

2753
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,820
Oh my god, here's the money!

2754
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:27,940
I did it!

2755
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:29,680
Oh my god.

2756
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:30,880
I squidgamed.

2757
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:33,380
I'm gonna get the crown.

2758
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,500
5 million dollars!

2759
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:43,760
Yippee!

2760
02:07:47,680 --> 02:07:49,100
Those don't look like real money.

2761
02:07:49,100 --> 02:07:50,880
Those look like Frankie bucks.

2762
02:07:53,540 --> 02:07:55,220
Okay, this stair is not...

2763
02:07:56,060 --> 02:07:57,740
This stair is not okay.

2764
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:09,880
Hey!

2765
02:08:10,100 --> 02:08:10,340
Hey!

2766
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:12,920
Look, paper plates is not...

2767
02:08:12,920 --> 02:08:13,660
It's a choice.

2768
02:08:14,620 --> 02:08:15,700
Paper plates are...

2769
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:17,440
Why is it like my apartment?

2770
02:08:20,740 --> 02:08:22,100
No, it's not accurate.

2771
02:08:22,200 --> 02:08:22,860
It has furniture.

2772
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:25,160
It has furniture.

2773
02:08:25,320 --> 02:08:26,100
It's not accurate.

2774
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:33,300
Why the fuck is the staircase like twerking right now?

2775
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:35,180
Why is the entire game twerking?

2776
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:38,200
Why would I grab your hat?

2777
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:39,880
I have 5 million dollars.

2778
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:42,900
I did that.

2779
02:08:46,870 --> 02:08:48,490
Oh my god!

2780
02:08:48,850 --> 02:08:50,930
Are we gonna hit a million concurrent viewers?

2781
02:08:55,280 --> 02:08:56,480
That stonks.

2782
02:08:57,060 --> 02:08:58,940
The game has jiggle physics.

2783
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:10,600
I did it.

2784
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:16,600
And now, I own 10% of the company.

2785
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:20,960
Bring in more contestants.

2786
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,560
It's like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

2787
02:09:23,660 --> 02:09:25,380
When you win, you own part of the company.

2788
02:09:29,320 --> 02:09:31,220
57 seasons and a movie.

2789
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:32,140
Yeah!

2790
02:09:32,820 --> 02:09:34,220
I'm the host now.

2791
02:09:34,220 --> 02:09:37,320
Why am I still?

2792
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:41,900
Oh no!

2793
02:09:45,870 --> 02:09:46,310
Yay!

2794
02:09:47,050 --> 02:09:48,510
Oh my god, credits?

2795
02:09:49,410 --> 02:09:51,030
Credits to parkour?

2796
02:09:51,290 --> 02:09:52,890
That's fucked.

2797
02:09:53,930 --> 02:09:55,210
That's actually fucked.

2798
02:09:55,850 --> 02:09:56,350
Wee!

2799
02:09:58,150 --> 02:10:00,450
We'll just look at the credits from here.

2800
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:03,290
Yeah!

2801
02:10:05,590 --> 02:10:06,530
Ba na na.

2802
02:10:07,070 --> 02:10:08,350
Ba na na.

2803
02:10:10,410 --> 02:10:11,710
We'll get past once.

2804
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:13,250
Please!

2805
02:10:14,230 --> 02:10:15,150
The timing!

2806
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:17,790
I swear to god.

2807
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:18,470
I swear.

2808
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:20,930
I swear to god!

2809
02:10:22,290 --> 02:10:22,970
There we go.

2810
02:10:23,030 --> 02:10:23,310
There we go.

2811
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:23,670
We did it.

2812
02:10:23,730 --> 02:10:24,350
We figured it out.

2813
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:28,490
Guys, it's not me.

2814
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:29,250
It's not me.

2815
02:10:29,310 --> 02:10:29,590
I swear.

2816
02:10:29,710 --> 02:10:29,950
I swear.

2817
02:10:30,830 --> 02:10:31,890
It's getting faster.

2818
02:10:32,010 --> 02:10:33,110
It's getting faster, guys.

2819
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:34,110
I swear to god.

2820
02:10:36,690 --> 02:10:37,450
Look, look.

2821
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:38,410
See, I'm doing it.

2822
02:10:39,130 --> 02:10:40,130
I'm doing it.

2823
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:42,330
Look at that.

2824
02:10:43,830 --> 02:10:45,290
We don't even see credits anymore.

2825
02:10:45,490 --> 02:10:47,110
We don't...

2826
02:10:48,570 --> 02:10:49,710
We broke the credits.

2827
02:10:49,990 --> 02:10:51,170
We broke the credits, guys.

2828
02:10:57,230 --> 02:10:57,650
No!

2829
02:10:57,790 --> 02:10:59,170
How am I supposed to win parkour?

2830
02:10:59,170 --> 02:10:59,850
How am I supposed to win parkour?

2831
02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:03,670
Stop farming clips.

2832
02:11:04,590 --> 02:11:06,150
I already won $50 million.

2833
02:11:06,690 --> 02:11:07,830
I don't need to farm clips anymore.

2834
02:11:08,530 --> 02:11:10,730
I own 10% of the company now.

2835
02:11:10,890 --> 02:11:12,330
I don't need to try.

2836
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:17,770
That was fun!

2837
02:11:18,630 --> 02:11:20,690
I had a great time.

2838
02:11:20,790 --> 02:11:21,270
That was nice.

2839
02:11:21,510 --> 02:11:22,350
That was a good game.

2840
02:11:22,770 --> 02:11:25,750
Even though it was really short, it was pretty enjoyable.

2841
02:11:25,750 --> 02:11:35,950
It's another spin on the whole Mascot Horror Mascot Horror series.

2842
02:11:36,850 --> 02:11:40,590
I enjoyed the nice twist it had there.

2843
02:11:43,450 --> 02:11:47,590
I think it was a little expensive for a two-hour game, though.

2844
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:55,750
I do admit that it was just a little bit more expensive than it should be because it was just two hours of content.

2845
02:11:55,930 --> 02:11:58,570
I think the music was really good as well.

2846
02:11:58,870 --> 02:12:03,010
I definitely enjoyed the music and the story.

2847
02:12:03,450 --> 02:12:05,570
I think it was like $15.

2848
02:12:09,290 --> 02:12:12,390
I think it was really fun, though.

2849
02:12:12,490 --> 02:12:13,750
I did enjoy it a lot.

2850
02:12:19,410 --> 02:12:20,790
That was fun.

2851
02:12:20,790 --> 02:12:21,330
That was fun.

2852
02:12:26,870 --> 02:12:32,570
When it started running at you and you got to complete the parkour part...

2853
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:42,670
That freaked me out.

2854
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:51,650
When they say deer in the headlights and you drive your car and the deer looks at you that's me.

2855
02:12:52,030 --> 02:12:53,330
I would get hit by a car.

2856
02:12:57,850 --> 02:13:00,030
I would definitely get hit by that car.

2857
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:06,030
I had a really fun time.

2858
02:13:07,010 --> 02:13:08,930
Back to chatting.

2859
02:13:15,190 --> 02:13:15,670
Today...

2860
02:13:15,670 --> 02:13:17,190
Our line stickers...

2861
02:13:17,190 --> 02:13:17,890
I'm so sad.

2862
02:13:18,850 --> 02:13:23,390
The line stickers got rejected and I don't know why.

2863
02:13:24,150 --> 02:13:26,890
Let me read you what it said.

2864
02:13:28,830 --> 02:13:30,310
What they said to me.

2865
02:13:30,490 --> 02:13:32,230
We edited the stickers.

2866
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:34,150
We edited the line stickers.

2867
02:13:34,690 --> 02:13:37,270
We don't know exactly what went wrong.

2868
02:13:37,670 --> 02:13:44,750
We couldn't sell it in Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, Indonesia because something was wrong.

2869
02:13:44,810 --> 02:13:47,930
But I didn't want to not be able to sell it in specific places.

2870
02:13:48,860 --> 02:13:51,450
We assumed that it had to deal.

2871
02:13:51,890 --> 02:13:53,730
We resubmitted it.

2872
02:13:53,930 --> 02:13:56,570
We resubmitted it to be...

2873
02:13:57,080 --> 02:13:58,450
to be...

2874
02:13:59,730 --> 02:14:00,950
to be approved.

2875
02:14:01,470 --> 02:14:07,810
But we think it's because we think it's because some hand gestures...

2876
02:14:07,810 --> 02:14:12,910
They were saying that some hand gestures are offensive or like...

2877
02:14:12,910 --> 02:14:16,790
affects different cultures around the world.

2878
02:14:17,070 --> 02:14:17,790
So I was like...

2879
02:14:17,790 --> 02:14:24,630
I was talking to the artist and we both assumed it had to do with the okay hand.

2880
02:14:25,070 --> 02:14:28,170
The okay gesture and the thumbs up.

2881
02:14:28,410 --> 02:14:35,150
Because we found out that in some places the thumbs up and the okay hand is considered offensive.

2882
02:14:35,590 --> 02:14:41,070
So we changed that to something different and then we resubmitted it too.

2883
02:14:41,210 --> 02:14:42,670
So I didn't know that.

2884
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:46,790
I didn't realize okay and thumbs up were offensive at all.

2885
02:14:47,150 --> 02:14:48,430
Because I don't fucking know.

2886
02:14:48,450 --> 02:14:49,970
I don't keep up to date anymore.

2887
02:14:50,670 --> 02:14:52,290
I don't keep up to date.

2888
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:54,070
I'm too busy being a VTuber.

2889
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:58,730
I'm not joking at that point.

2890
02:14:58,850 --> 02:15:09,110
I'm too busy with everything else in my life to try to figure out what is if that gesture is offensive.

2891
02:15:10,730 --> 02:15:12,870
So I didn't know.

2892
02:15:13,330 --> 02:15:15,130
So I was really confused.

2893
02:15:15,330 --> 02:15:17,810
I was just like, what do you mean?

2894
02:15:18,930 --> 02:15:20,730
Let me show you guys.

2895
02:15:21,650 --> 02:15:23,570
I'm trying to see if I can find...

2896
02:15:23,570 --> 02:15:25,390
So the two want two of them.

2897
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:40,330
If it does get approved and those were like the stickers that got denied, made the whole reason the sticker pack got denied online, then we're just gonna release the other two as...

2898
02:15:40,330 --> 02:15:46,850
We're just gonna release the other two as free downloadable stickers.

2899
02:15:46,950 --> 02:15:52,390
I was planning on making some free stickers as well for people, for Dragoons to be able to download it.

2900
02:15:52,430 --> 02:15:59,070
So those who can't afford the other ones, the paid line ones, they're like $2.

2901
02:15:59,690 --> 02:16:01,150
But it's still money.

2902
02:16:01,150 --> 02:16:05,250
You guys can still try and you guys can still

2903
02:16:09,910 --> 02:16:11,670
use the free ones.

2904
02:16:11,810 --> 02:16:14,450
So I'm gonna try and find it right now.

2905
02:16:15,890 --> 02:16:18,290
I didn't download the GIFs version.

2906
02:16:18,490 --> 02:16:20,830
I used the APNG and APNG isn't animated.

2907
02:16:23,410 --> 02:16:25,240
It's not animated on the...

2908
02:16:27,030 --> 02:16:28,070
on OBS.

2909
02:16:28,290 --> 02:16:29,270
Sorry, my brain is dead.

2910
02:16:29,270 --> 02:16:31,630
We changed this one.

2911
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:37,270
This is animated by the way, but I can't be bothered to upload the animated version.

2912
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:43,610
But this is animated by the way, so I just give you guys a thumbs up.

2913
02:16:43,890 --> 02:16:45,270
And the other one was...

2914
02:16:46,610 --> 02:16:49,510
This one that also got...

2915
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:50,970
This one that also...

2916
02:16:50,970 --> 02:16:52,310
We assume...

2917
02:16:52,310 --> 02:16:54,950
We assume these were the ones that got denied.

2918
02:16:59,270 --> 02:17:01,390
We assume because we're like, what's offensive?

2919
02:17:01,730 --> 02:17:03,150
We were looking through...

2920
02:17:03,150 --> 02:17:04,030
I don't know.

2921
02:17:04,150 --> 02:17:04,750
I was like...

2922
02:17:04,750 --> 02:17:06,610
I don't know which one's offensive.

2923
02:17:07,370 --> 02:17:12,110
I assume because these were the only ones that had gestures that they're the offensive one.

2924
02:17:12,350 --> 02:17:14,850
Because the other ones are just like... I don't know.

2925
02:17:14,930 --> 02:17:16,130
The other ones weren't...

2926
02:17:16,830 --> 02:17:19,070
No, they didn't even specify.

2927
02:17:19,370 --> 02:17:21,010
I was like, hello, what is it?

2928
02:17:21,090 --> 02:17:21,850
I messaged.

2929
02:17:22,010 --> 02:17:22,790
It was like a message.

2930
02:17:22,950 --> 02:17:25,690
I was like, hello, what is offensive?

2931
02:17:26,070 --> 02:17:27,590
And then...

2932
02:17:27,590 --> 02:17:28,930
I got no reply.

2933
02:17:29,290 --> 02:17:30,850
So I was just like, alright.

2934
02:17:33,470 --> 02:17:34,550
That's a hand gesture.

2935
02:17:34,750 --> 02:17:35,590
So I think...

2936
02:17:35,590 --> 02:17:37,690
I think that's... It has to be.

2937
02:17:40,330 --> 02:17:41,590
It has to be.

2938
02:17:41,790 --> 02:17:42,910
So like, yeah.

2939
02:17:43,010 --> 02:17:43,650
I was just like...

2940
02:17:43,650 --> 02:17:45,350
I don't keep up to date with stuff anymore.

2941
02:17:45,530 --> 02:17:47,270
So like, that's my bad.

2942
02:17:47,290 --> 02:17:48,730
Because I'm terminally...

2943
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:50,810
I'm terminally online.

2944
02:17:51,210 --> 02:17:53,570
But I'm also very...

2945
02:17:54,310 --> 02:17:55,890
Oblivious to a lot of things.

2946
02:18:01,740 --> 02:18:02,220
So...

2947
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:04,480
So...

2948
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:06,220
I'm really sorry.

2949
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:07,040
I didn't know.

2950
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:13,100
But yeah, we did...

2951
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:14,320
We changed it to...

2952
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:17,180
So we changed both of them.

2953
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,520
So instead of like...

2954
02:18:18,520 --> 02:18:20,060
I can show you what we changed it to.

2955
02:18:20,300 --> 02:18:22,480
So instead, we changed it to this.

2956
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:24,000

2957
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:24,280

Good job!

2963
02:18:34,260 --> 02:18:35,540
So we changed it to this.

2964
02:18:36,580 --> 02:18:38,160
Instead of the hand gesture.

2965
02:18:38,200 --> 02:18:39,280
So I... I don't know.

2966
02:18:39,360 --> 02:18:40,800
