1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,900
I'm back.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,420
I was on YouTube settings.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,840
Oopsie.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,440
Sorry guys, I was on my YouTube settings.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,620
Let me check how crunchy it was.

6
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:20,340
I'll check.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,620
Oh my god.

8
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,300
Damn, that's ugly as hell.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:24,900
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,720
I was on my...

11
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,940
Yeah, oh my god, that shit was grunt.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,940
That shit is ugly.

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,640
Sorry, I was on my YouTube settings.

14
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,300
Well, it wasn't that bad.

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,060
No wonder I was lagging too.

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,300
Come on!

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,340
Was it that bad?

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,520
Was it...

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,880
I like how I like just...

20
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,900
lost all my viewers just to change it.

21
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,170
Was it really that bad?

22
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:00,890
How bad?

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,590
Come on.

24
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,370
It wasn't that bad, was it?

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,290
It was just a bit bad.

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:18,450
now who am i gonna banish from this match all right it was just a bit bad

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:50,460
all right no i was literally i had it on my youtube i had my youtube settings no i just had to have 1440 um x i was streaming it on 1440p instead of 1080 i lowered the bitrate um i lowered the bitrate but i uh i forgot to lower my res I forgot to lower the resolution.

28
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,880
That's why we were, it was like, uh, crunchy.

29
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,830
I just forgot to do the other thing.

30
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,870
Look, this was a gorilla stream, so...

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:09,550
I wasn't meant to, like, have everything figured out on a gorilla stream.

32
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,570
I can basically do...

33
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,010
You'll be a top-notch team to win this one.

34
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,270
I get to fuck up more.

35
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,550
I'm in the snow.

36
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,610
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

37
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,490
Yeah, it's clear now.

38
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,810
I have an excuse where I can fuck up more on the gorilla stream.

39
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,510
Okay, now I'm not crunchy anymore.

40
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,530
Okay, it wasn't that bad, guys.

41
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,510
Wait, when you stream at 1440p, does it actually lag?

42
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,370
The stream?

43
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,340
Okay, I can put it at 260.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,660
Let's say I can play at 240 frames.

45
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,900
30 seconds before you attack.

46
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,700
Get ready.

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:21,100
I don't know why I've been like lagging often though it's weird I'm gonna check my CPU right now I'm getting my CPU replaced this week oh yeah no I was at it like spikes to a hundred randomly it's so weird like my CPU but I'm getting my CPU replaced this week so maybe it'll work It'll be better.

48
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,060
It just randomly spikes.

49
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,060
Oh my god, Ramona!

50
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,780
Thank you for the 10 gifted songs!

51
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,500
Thank you!

52
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,340
Thank you!

53
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,970
Got a siloed back by everybody on the floor.

54
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,250
Yeah, you do.

55
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,050
Yeah, I was trying to...

56
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,550
Trying to fucking make sure he's okay.

57
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,830
I didn't see him.

58
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,030
Oh my god!

59
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,150
I'm sorry!

60
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,050
I'm sorry!

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,390
Oh!

62
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,310
Okay.

63
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,350
Okay, that was my bad.

64
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,150
I missed my one shot.

65
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,410
I missed my shot.

66
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,170
Sorry, I had like a fear when I saw it.

67
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,970
Instead of mag, I feared a captain.

68
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,030
That is much better.

69
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,350
I guess I'll put it on.

70
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,010
Phoenix now.

71
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,010
Okay, I gotta make sure me and the Loki...

72
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:31,210
I'm pocketing the Loki as much as I could.

73
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,710
Does that hit me?

74
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,710
No, okay.

75
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,330
Oh, I'm trying!

76
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,310
Oh, I'm sorry, Loki, I'm sorry!

77
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:55,820
Alright.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,760

We did it!

84
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,360
We're all safe!

85
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:39,900
Yay!

86
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:43,900
Ah!

87
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,280
Okay, I don't know about that though.

88
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,240
I don't think we needed that.

89
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,800
But that's okay.

90
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,340
You were getting harassed, like I understand.

91
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,540
Honestly.

92
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,820
I understand.

93
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,420
He was honestly getting harassed for so long, like I understand.

94
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,300
Oh my god, why am I lagging so much?

95
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,780
I definitely need to like...

96
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,300
I'm definitely gonna replace my CPU, because it's been happening a lot more.

97
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,920
Where is it?

98
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,780
Cap one, cap one, cap one, cap one.

99
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:27,740
Hello?

100
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,780

105
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,140
One brother back.

106
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,310
Oh my god, I don't got you.

107
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:46,970
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,710
I thought I did.

109
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,610
I really thought I did.

110
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:53,990
Oh, thank god.

111
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,830
No, that thing's not up, didn't it?

112
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,270

I fucked with you so heavy, bro.

114
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,390
You got on the more and you made me not suffer.

115
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,570
I look into it.

116
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,590
I look into it.

117
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,210
It's been happening recently, though.

118
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,450
I have no idea why.

119
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,910
It's been a recent thing.

120
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,790
Okay.

121
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,310

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,690
We're doing it.

123
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,490
We'll stop when we lose.

124
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:53,030
This will be the shortest Stop streaming when we lose This is gonna be like and then we're gonna lose this game I'm gonna be funny if we lose on this game.

125
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,190

Get that vehicle moving again!

134
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,500
I even restarted my PC too.

135
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,540
I restarted my PC before my stream.

136
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,520
So I have no idea.

137
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,940
It's been, it's just a, it's a recent thing though.

138
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:07,920
But...

139
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,680
Woo!

140
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:09,900
No!

141
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,160
I was to your brain!

142
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,580
Maybe I should do put it on 160.

143
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,260
Okay, maybe it's a 240.

144
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,380
Too many attempts.

145
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,400
I don't remember what my CPU is.

146
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,600
I don't remember.

147
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,360
Looky one, looky one, looky one.

148
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,540
Alright.

149
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,780
There we go.

150
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,800
We're okay.

151
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
Everything is okay.

152
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,080
Okay.

153
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:46,860
One more silo.

154
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,840
Layers, windows, cop- yeah, it's a- it's a recent thing.

155
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,500
I have no idea what's causing it.

156
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,740
It's like a recent thing.

157
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:05,900
Because like, I used to be the- my- I used to never lag for my skinset in the past.

158
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,700
So I'm pretty- it's just something to do with- something either to my PC or like- Okay.

Keep around.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,640
It's not okay.

180
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,060
Finish one.

181
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:07,500
Finish that.

182
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,840
I need reload.

183
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,140
It's not okay anymore.

184
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,580
It's not okay anymore.

185
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,520
It's not okay anymore.

186
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
2-2-0.

187
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,180
settings.

188
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,500
Yeah, I don't know why it's been, it's been like this.

189
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,520
It's so weird.

190
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,360
My CPU just like randomly spikes.

191
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,680
It's not like, it's at 100.

192
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,060
It goes from like, uh, like 60 and then it spikes to 100.

193
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,600
So I have no idea why it does that.

194
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,220
Oh, I'm playing with pizza right now.

195
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,760
I haven't lost yet.

196
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,800
Yeah, you were too late.

197
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,800
Yeah, I was playing pizza.

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,220
This might be our first loss.

199
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,180
No, I use AMD.

200
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,840
I use AMD.

201
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:31,700
Because, like, I had two faulty Intel CPUs that both got fried.

202
00:13:32,100 --> 00:14:08,400
You know, like when they had that thing where the tails were frying both my intel cpu fried yeah and i'm pretty sure uh amd there i think my i think my cpu fried i think maybe because i don't know why like um why that happened oh my god goodbye it's like over time i've been that my cnc's been not dying anymore hello if we are looking oh

203
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:33,740
the one time i stuck close to him if if he healed me i wouldn't have been next to him that's all i'll say if he was next to me i wouldn't have had to if he was he healed me i wouldn't have had to suck next to him because i needed the invalne i needed the invalne because i wasn't getting healed

204
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,900
That's all I'll say.

205
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:39,800
It wasn't my fault.

206
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,480
I literally got self-sabotage.

207
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,740
Also, why don't we have a fucking Emma player?

208
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,480
This is going to last because we don't have an Emma.

209
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,080
This is the only reason we're losing.

210
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,040
I please!

211
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm like, beloved.

212
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:10,580
Okay, if we lose a second time, I'm calling it because we had a really good win streak going on.

213
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,220
If at least.

214
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,240
No, I was so unlucky.

215
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,580
I literally had, like, two Intel CPUs that fried.

216
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,500
Because, like, they were the default one.

217
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,720
Like, they were the faulty ones.

218
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,800
And, like, it wasn't, like, it over time, it fried.

219
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,120
It fried, literally, like, um...

220
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,500
Like, it fried nearly after, like, a month.

221
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,880
That was how fucked up it was.

222
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,780
Oh, my God.

223
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,400
Please look behind you.

224
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,820
I don't know what else you want me to do!

225
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,280
See, this is why Loki is so hard to play.

226
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,320
You have to be aware of your entire fucking surroundings every time.

227
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,740
I am so...

228
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:33,380
position I guess not I was on it I literally went back to it did they break it they broke it they broke at the last minute they actually broke it in the last minute that's crazy they broke it at such the perfect time

229
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:56,290
but yeah the the intel thing only like um like a certain percentage um are faulty and i got i hit it twice i literally had that happen twice oh now we play emma that's great wait who asked for it okay

230
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:05,270
please please please every time

231
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:22,010
I got hooked 3 out of 3 That's fucked up it was It was so fucked up Whoever that was Hey Snowflake please and then made me look back

232
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:41,330
Is it because of the new Nvidia drivers Oh really is it That makes so much more sense I had to upgrade my drivers I had to upgrade my drivers Um for battlefield is it

233
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:59,300
if i downgrade right now oh my god are you kidding me oh my that's why i've been frame dropping so hard yeah

234
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:14,790
i mean it could be like we're doing that on like other uh um no no i have nvidia drivers for gpu We're talking about GPU.

235
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,290
Yeah, I had to upgrade my drivers for Battlefield.

236
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,050
Because they won't let me play Battlefield unless I had, like, that specific, like, driver.

237
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:31,470
And ever since I upgraded it, my Marvel rival, my Marvel rival, like, for me, I've been, my CPU has been jumping to 100 for some reason.

238
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,290
It's so stupid.

239
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:41,750
Yeah, it is.

240
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,470
It's pretty stupid.

241
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,810
I had to, because I kept my drivers.

242
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,510
I kept my drivers low.

243
00:18:50,650 --> 00:19:37,400
one that uh oh yeah and the secure boot thing too yeah because i was like i've never lagged before so like i'm not actually lagging in terms of like my gameplay but it's my skin suit that's lagging it's pretty annoying also boba sapien think of the hundred bitties thank you thank you i thought you're queuing to the go to mode mode dude match and not till queuing well i wasn't till queuing really i've been i won like one two three four five games in a row which is i had an unlucky game here and i kept getting hooked so that was super unlucky yeah i know the secure boot is fucking ass all right i'll do what if we lose the next game i'm calling it

244
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:49,890
because like i don't want to lose everything i gained you know

245
00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:06,930
i know i know it was just the early access too made me do so much for just early access and i only played for like two hours i'm at two to three hours i only played two to three hours

246
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:15,180
leave the casino i got we got cash out before it's too late

247
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:46,690
used to do 16 hours what happened i think if i wasn't if my skin suit wasn't lagging i'd play longer but i don't want to give you guys like you know a shittier quality stream for too long i mean i still will but like i just don't want to give it to you for too long

248
00:20:53,810 --> 00:21:10,850
it's doing all right because i'm not in game that's why also no stream tomorrow by the way no stream tomorrow oh my god we have two rocket players what are the fucking odds we have no damage rocket oh and he's not wait is that oh yeah of course the rocket player is not in vc yeah i did I turned DLSS.

249
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,970
I don't know why it does not automatically.

250
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:15,470
Did that, like, it turns itself on automatically.

251
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:16,570
I did.

252
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:17,030
See?

253
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,750
DLSS off.

254
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,930
Oh, anti-alias.

255
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,910
Yeah, I turned that.

256
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,050
I turned it off.

257
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,970
Turn that off.

258
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,460
So I have no idea why it's been doing that.

259
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,280
Alright.

260
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,520
Orch.

261
00:21:50,130 --> 00:22:04,530
okay but no damage rocket is a fucking he has he's weak-willed he swaps off rocket when he's losing not a real one trick we didn't ban oh my god i went to blow my nose and we didn't ban

262
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:25,220
not a real one he's fucking weak-willed as hell you see when you're losing and you're a one trick and you're a supposed one trick you just mute everybody and keep playing yeah you better fucking commit to it yeah

263
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:41,560
not a real one trick i know because he i see i've had i've played against him and he literally swaps off if they if it's not working that can't even commit

264
00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:22,830
you really want most people no i'm just saying if you're like known as a rocket otp like you're an actual rocket otp if you're gonna role play as rocket raccoon and like swap off rocket when it ain't working for you then you're not real you're not a real one you're weak as fuck you care more about winning than rocket raccoon that's right you have to stop them from securing the missionaries

265
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,590
You care- you don't actually care about Rocket.

266
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,290
See?

267
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:37,850
See?

268
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,370
Look!

269
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:38,830
Look!

270
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,030
He cares more about winning!

271
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:40,610
Look!

272
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,930
He's on Luna!

273
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,610
He's on fucking Luna!

274
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,350
Weak as the shit.

275
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,950
Weak will.

276
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,930
Weak fucking will.

277
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,770
I swear to God!

278
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,750
Where the fuck is the rocket?

279
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,310
He didn't even start on his rocket.

280
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,150
Change your name now.

281
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,790
Where even was my rocket?

282
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,890
There was no way to position myself in any other way where it would help me.

283
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,750
See, my rocket at least stays on rocket.

284
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,030
He doesn't care.

285
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,350
He doesn't care about winning.

286
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,870
He just wants to play his fucking character.

287
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,660
Oh, it's...

288
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,500
Why is Wufo's on mag?

289
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,160
Is it Wufo's a support player?

290
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,160
Or is this his like...

291
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,460
Or unless he...

292
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,620
You're gonna destroy it?

293
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:16,880
my that's unlucky oh guys i'm we might lose this too yeah we might lose this as well

294
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:55,780
oh nice wait we got a kill oh my god wait we won a fight there was not enough to stack i had to use it if like if there were three of us and we didn't have a fucking rocket then i would believe in oh my god our rocket's dead oh my god okay that's unfortunate and i think our okay our mag is this nice we only

295
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:19,220
no we're not quitting after three oh hey i'm not lagging anymore though wait i'm not lagging nice wait how did i fix it what did i do to fix it do anything i mean i'll see in the fucking spawn

296
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:42,620
i don't know what i did it just worked goodbye wait why did they or captain america's fucking don't wait no he's back that's the thing sometimes it just fixes i think it's my cpu frying because sometimes or is i my drivers or my cpu frying because like sometimes it just It just fixes itself like the fake trigger stream.

297
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,400
Like, I don't know what's like, what's going on.

298
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,520
Oh,

299
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,190
he has strange up.

300
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,810
I am ready to put on a show.

301
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:09,950
It doesn't matter, I'm just gonna die.

302
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,310
It doesn't matter, I'm just gonna die.

303
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:13,530
It doesn't die.

304
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,830
Yeah, I think it's just the drive.

305
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,150
It's drivers and CPU.

306
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,090
No, I- this was like GG's.

307
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,490
All right.

308
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,230
This was a bonus tree- no, I- Please don't kill me.

309
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,300
Yeah, I didn't die.

310
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:59,700
Our solo tank is- The fact that our solo tank is, um, Captain America.

311
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,560
It's a little- I'm Serene.

312
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,280
We're...

313
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,520
I'm trying my best.

314
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,120
I'm Ashley.

315
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,820
He's popped!

316
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,060
I got popped!

317
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,020
Alright.

318
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,060
I run.

319
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:25,640
Oh wait, that's ours.

320
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,820
Oh, I got you rocket.

321
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,580
But who's got me?

322
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,920
Oh shit.

323
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,660
Oh shit.

324
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,840
Oh shit.

325
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,980
He just soloed it.

326
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:49,320
Okay.

327
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,980
I'm fine with that.

328
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm definitely gonna downgrade my drivers then after the stream.

329
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,680
See if that works.

330
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,380
I hear someone behind me.

331
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,550
Why?

332
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,650
Oh shit!

333
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,850
What the fuck is he doing here?

334
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:48,840
what the fuck oh my okay okay so which piggy is gonna get out of pts one of my four and five and four pigs why did no one turn around and kill the loki including which side you're on literally i was the only one that saw the This is your sign to play it one way.

335
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,760
You know, the swap, bro?

336
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,660
You just want to lose the game.

337
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,760
Either one's won.

338
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,660
I don't think anyone's going to swap, guys.

339
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,200
Oh, hey, we got triple support.

340
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,460
Maybe that works.

341
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,220
Maybe that'll work out.

342
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,250
I have to put it on...

343
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:09,990
Do I put on Ultra on or Captain America?

344
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,210
Oh, okay.

345
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,330
I guess I'll put it on Ultra.

346
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:14,470
I don't think we're winning this, though.

347
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,350
I think this is GG's.

348
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:28,230
As if we lose the next game, I get out of Celestia too.

349
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,730
I think?

350
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,790
I don't even remember actually.

351
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,070
I don't know where I'm at anymore.

352
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,230
Celestia is such a weird Elo right now.

353
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:49,510
Also, there's a lot of players that, like, fell hard since they deleted stacking.

354
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:51,270
I've noticed.

355
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,530
What?

356
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:04,780
What?

357
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:06,480
How?

358
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:11,420
Why?

359
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:12,740
All

360
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:18,190
right.

361
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,210
Wait, something is behind us?

362
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,070
Like...

363
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,490
Oh, it was the...

364
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:29,210
Oh, it was It was so fucking strange.

365
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,910
I was like, what's behind us?

366
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,390
I have to put the snowflake on our ultra, apparently.

367
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,690
Like, how...

368
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,690
Wait, he swapped up!

369
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,290
You swapped off now!

370
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,310
You had eight!

371
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,190
Oh, my God.

372
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,070
You actually had 80 years to swap off.

373
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:47,870
Like...

374
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,970
Why did you swap off during defense?

375
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,690
I don't understand!

376
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:57,990
How?

377
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,950
How do you swap off now?

378
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,090
I am ready to put on a show.

379
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:07,830
Oh my god, please.

380
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,430
Oh my god.

381
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,890
Oh, he didn't damage boost.

382
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,690
Thank fucking god, he's stupid.

383
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,090
Mag, mag, I'm literally mag.

384
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:19,530
Oh, thank god, okay.

385
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,890
We did not need to do that, but that's okay.

386
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:40,110
okay there you go he only plays he's a fake rocket what the fuck where is he

387
00:32:44,030 --> 00:33:00,850
what oh my god oh my god i was not expecting them to touch now they're gonna pour it out now they can pour it out that sucks oh now they don't pour it out oh Oh my god, and they have lamps too.

388
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,090
We don't win these.

389
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,470
We actually don't win these.

390
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,930
We actually don't win these.

391
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,930
That's crazy.

392
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:11,410
Oh my god, we...

393
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,090
Oh my god, we actually don't win these.

394
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,070
No, we...

395
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,470
No, this is actually a team death.

396
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,710
This is actually a team death.

397
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,190
How did we not kill the Luna?

398
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,570
How did none of us shoot the eye of this?

399
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,420
I hate, like, players that, like, they swap when in the second round.

400
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,200
Because, like, they don't realize this is a counter-swap game.

401
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,320
Guys, it's not like League where you can't swap after you pick a character.

402
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,560
It's not a MOBA, guys.

403
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,820
You can swap whenever you want.

404
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,300
I know it's crazy concept.

405
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:20,620
someone is countering you you can change your character it's crazy that exists as a concept i know it's such a crazy concept if you think about it that counter swapping is i think

406
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:35,530
no way counter swap in my counter swapping in my hero shooter say it ain't fucking so

407
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,260
This is late night queues though.

408
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,120
These are late night queues.

409
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,680
Oh, shit.

410
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:49,720
My bad.

411
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,580
Sorry for looking at you.

412
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:59,320
This is like the one team that cannot fucking- Iron Fist right now is like actually B tier.

413
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,520
This is like the one team that can't counter fucking Iron Fist- sorry, Iron Fist right now.

414
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,860
It's insane.

415
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:15,220
We are that one team that seems to be struggling with an iron fist.

416
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,480
How did you let him fucking do that in front of us?

417
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,600
He was healing in front of us.

418
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,940
How did we let that happen?

419
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,760
No, we don't deserve to win.

420
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,300
We absolutely don't deserve to win.

421
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,820
Oh my god, he's just fly.

422
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,200
No I hear the low heat.

423
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,740
He doesn't, like, I don't know, I hear footsteps.

424
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,460
I was like, I don't know, he's clearly invisible.

425
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:15,200
unreal how like like the iron fist might as well be invisible women like they nerfed invisible women and then they gave it to iron fist and he just exists to be invisible

426
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,920
oh this might be where he dies he has no bubble too

427
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,780
what really you would think okay whatever whatever Let him, I guess.

428
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,040
Okay, sure.

429
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,680
Fucking chuck it at me, I guess.

430
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,860
Kobe, that shit.

431
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,720
You would think it would go towards, I don't know, the cloak?

432
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,020
That's alright.

433
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,260
Yeah, I can actually hear footsteps in this game.

434
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,100
Oh, it does exist.

435
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,100
No, EOM exists, but it's like their own special EOM.

436
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:22,240
the regular EOMM it's their own manufactured EOMM it exists but it's just their their version since it's their version it's technically not called EOM if you think about it oh now they have group all

437
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:42,400
right I'll push the cart cart pushing I'll go yippee I'm not gonna say it's winnable because having hope is a mistake.

438
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,680
It's always better to be a doomer.

439
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,700
I don't know if we have anything.

440
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,000
Do we even have anything?

441
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,540
Oh, Art.

442
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,280
Okay.

443
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,040
He did.

444
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,780
He did.

445
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,240
Oh, they're gonna grill this 100%.

446
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,480
Yep.

447
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,240
I caught it.

448
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,580
I had a feeling.

449
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,980
I had a feeling that was what's gonna happen.

450
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,360
No, we're not gonna get any support up.

451
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,020
How do you know?

452
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,740
Because he didn't...

453
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,940
Marble Arrivals has the easiest ult tracking in history.

454
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,520
It's weird.

455
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,800
It's like...

456
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,760
We just stacked.

457
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,460
But he stalled it.

458
00:38:39,940 --> 00:39:14,340
Marble Arrivals, ult tracking, is literally every other fight he has all because it's so easy to build all in marvel rivals can we even make yeah our side locks in touch i was gonna say let's not send on guys let's not send on let's whoa yeah let's not send on everybody are you serious that's so unless That's actually so enoughy.

459
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,240
See, that's what stacking does.

460
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:20,620
Yeah.

461
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,680
Oh, yeah, and then people are like, oh man, how do you all track in this game?

462
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
It's every other fight.

463
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,480
If they used it in the last two fights, they're gonna get it again.

464
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:40,460
If you use Luna Old, when the other enemy team has used Luna Old, when you have Luna Old, the other team has Luna Old.

465
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,220
It's just that easy.

466
00:39:47,020 --> 00:40:15,240
I think like all tracking for this game is just Very simple That's why when people are The good all trackers are the one that knows the percentage And be like oh they're gonna get it But to be fair I feel like if you just think That you're gonna get it every other fight You just automatically assume you're gonna get it every other fight You don't really need percentages for it Unless you're like I guess like in a tournament It matters more You're like oh you gotta push them Cause you're like 80% all charged for the salt now Or some shit But like,

467
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:15,840
I'm not pro.

468
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,180
I'm just a rank player.

469
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,880
I literally play this as a hobby.

470
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,080
I mean, yeah, if they cancel their alt.

471
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,780
If they're at 50%...

472
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:29,600
If you alt cancel somebody, they get their alt at 50%.

473
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,000
That means they're at 50%.

474
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,900
So they'll get their alt in the next fight.

475
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,760
That's literally it.

476
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,500
You can get 50% of your alt in one fight.

477
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,640
I play at a high level, but I'm just a casual.

478
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,420
Because I stream variety more.

479
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:48,040
I play this for fun because I enjoy competitive.

480
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,160
Oh, am I lagging again?

481
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,680
Yeah, it's a driver thing, apparently.

482
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,900
At least now I know.

483
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,180
I'll downgrade it.

484
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,220
I'll downgrade it after the stream.

485
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:07,720
Yay!

486
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,840
Hey, he's one.

487
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,400
Never mind, he's no longer one.

488
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,220
But I will continue clapping.

489
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,680
Oh no, we lost our siloed at a very bad time.

490
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,600
Our siloed dying is very bad.

491
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,460
It's very bad for him to die at this time.

492
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,920
Okay, let's not send none, everyone.

493
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:43,320
I can't.

494
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:43,840
I don't think...

495
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,640
Because we have triple support.

496
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,560
Yeah, I was gonna say, the only thing we have is little troll.

497
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,460
I don't think I can bring it all in time.

498
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,320
How the fuck?

499
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,800
Oh yeah, because they're not triple support.

500
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,580
I was gonna say, that's so unlucky.

501
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,660
It just sucks because...

502
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,960
Oh, I'm dead here.

503
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,900
Yep, it's just me dead.

504
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:08,820
Whoop.

505
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,520
It's because we're on triple support, so we built the store.

506
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,280
Oh, it's unlucky.

507
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:19,700
I'm not sure.

508
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,920
The current score is...

509
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm not going for top 500.

510
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,180
I'm just playing the game.

511
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,360
I'm not actually...

512
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,400
I'm not grinding for anything.

513
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,400
Oh, but with sapient, they give the 150s.

514
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,080
Thank you, thank you.

515
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,400
After the nurse, Phoenix may not have had an explosion.

516
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:38,540
That's 38 damage.

517
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,300
And now Iron Fist's basic strike does 30.

518
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,180
But at this point, I might as well just go Loki.

519
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,060
Actually, no.

520
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:49,080
If he's going Ultron, I have to play later.

521
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,220
Or the Snowflake.

522
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,420
Yeah, we're losing this one.

523
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,200
He does less damage than Phoenix of the melee.

524
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,120
Not even factoring flight.

525
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,520
Double animation canceling.

526
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,300
No, Phoenix is.

527
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,580
Phoenix is metal.

528
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,080
It's hard metal and high elo.

529
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,820
Because if you play in high elo and you can coordinate it well.

530
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,440
She's so strong.

531
00:43:14,660 --> 00:44:22,590
she's like one she's basically a stronger hella and phoenix phoenix and torch are phoenix torch and saia are permaband and hi elo um oh yeah i was gonna say uh oh iron fist oh you're saying iron you want iron fist to get buff no he doesn't deserve it he does not deserve no as a support player he does not deserve any buffs i thought you were talking about phoenix sorry i was like wondering why are you saying he for phoenix i was gonna say what i'm gonna say earlier oh yeah um the reason why invisible i found this out recently but the reason why invisible woman was so strong was because she was so buggy that her her alt was apparently accidentally doubled when she ults she's like her all was not supposed to do that much damage during launch so that's why she was so strong and nobody knew until like recently from what i've heard yeah so her all was bugged in a way that it was doing double the healing than it was supposed to and no one knew until that's why she's so weak now because they

532
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:43,480
fixed the bug yeah her all was doing two times the heals and that's why she's so weak yeah i had a feeling this was ggs yeah no her all always healing two times and what it should be.

533
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,600
And then they fix it.

534
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,680
That's why she doesn't cheat.

535
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,820
She is so weak now.

536
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,460
He cheated by not going.

537
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,160
Exactly!

538
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,540
That's what I'm saying!

539
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,040
Exactly!

540
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,160
Okay.

541
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,780
How about this?

542
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,080
I will lose one more.

543
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,040
Because then, alright.

544
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,220
I'll just end on Celestia.

545
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,040
I'm happy with... I'll do one.

546
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,080
one more loss.

547
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,980
How about that?

548
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,280
There's, yeah, there's no honor in that, exactly.

549
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,320
There's no honor in this, in that victory.

550
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:21,260
I'm gonna use the bathroom now.

551
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:21,700
We're back.

552
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:25,090
Matt, thank you for the hundred biddies.

553
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:25,910
Thank you.

554
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:26,310
Silver!

555
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,230
Um, thank you for the hundred biddies.

556
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,250
Medi, thank you.

557
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:29,990
There's a hundred biddies.

558
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,350
Thank you.

559
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:30,950
Thank you.

560
00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,110
Is Cloak better than uh, what was it?

561
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,090
Is Cloak better than Viz?

562
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:36,570
Yes.

563
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:37,870
She is.

564
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:41,350
She's a lot better because she's, she's meta in certain math.

565
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:43,050
because you can use it to push.

566
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,290
You can use it to push forward.

567
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:50,430
Because you can walk forward with the Cloakle in team fights.

568
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,190
So certain maps is actually meta.

569
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,550
For Cloak and Dagger.

570
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,470
Invis sucks right now.

571
00:46:57,930 --> 00:46:59,630
Ramona, thank you for the 10 souls.

572
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:00,070
Thank you.

573
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:00,710
Thank you.

574
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:02,610
What do you think you want to be today?

575
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:06,710
Like that.

576
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:08,310
I shine in darkness.

577
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:10,530
Let's see.

578
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:12,530
I mean, we could go low-key Cloak and Dagger.

579
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:13,290
So we can do...

580
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:14,510
two forward ults.

581
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:20,590
I feel like, yeah, I feel like I should play Loki, so our cloak and dagger can have the Involve.

582
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,900
Not bad, Torch.

583
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,380
Fuck, Torch.

584
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,160
Torch is actually so broken.

585
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,300
Uh, Bobo Sabian, thank you for the hundred bitties.

586
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,020
Thank you, thank you.

587
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:54,400
Even if Iron Fist doesn't get a damage buff, then you need to bring back his old Flurry Punch momentum because his whole shit is movement and not, and he barely even gains height from his right click.

588
00:47:54,560 --> 00:48:27,520
It won't make support live harder, makes him so much more fun as a support player i think you don't deserve rights right now slash jk slash slash jk i i'm just joking and we didn't bat anything because i was i'm bra you're i am a biased individual yes i know i agree with that no i if you are a Fellow die player,

589
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,760
I revoke your rights.

590
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:40,780
I am a very biased individual.

591
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,360
There's no free speech in this lobby.

592
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:54,540
In this chat, in this chat, there is absolutely zero free speech.

593
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,520
But all I have left so wrong.

594
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,140
Get ready.

595
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:06,120
Oh my god, I'm almost...

596
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:07,120
Yeah, thank you for the videos.

597
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,080
Thank you.

598
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,560
Good.

599
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:15,160
This is not a safe space for dive players.

600
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,260
Don't you have no rights to dive exactly.

601
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,960
This is not a safe space.

602
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:25,380
You too.

603
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,980
And also rocket players.

604
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:41,940
I mean, rocket players aren't even real people, so like they don't get, they already don't have rights because they're not even human.

605
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,520
They're a freaking freak of nature.

606
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:50,270
But.

607
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:57,010
Nice.

608
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,250
It's fine.

609
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,890
I'm fine.

610
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,930
I'm about to...

611
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:06,490
There you go.

612
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,010
You're fine.

613
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:07,710
You're fine.

614
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:08,950
You're fine.

615
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,550
You're so healthy.

616
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:16,090
Look at that.

617
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:16,370
See?

618
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,050
Look at that.

619
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,490
There's that... There's an iron fist right there.

620
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:22,490
You think that iron fist deserved rights right there?

621
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:27,250
You think that iron fist deserved having speaking rights?

622
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,630
Oh my god!

623
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,670
How am I racist when you're not?

624
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:55,150
not even human rocket like it's not even racism when you're not even human and bucket just push forward

625
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:36,720
no no no there we go there we go see like that you push forward with it um we're supposed to like I don't fucking know we're supposed to like win a fight there but that's fine oh nice that's fine I'm gonna realize it doesn't stack anymore but that's fine it's fine why is our Emma doing over there like okay oh my god I wanted to be hog around but that's fine

626
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:42,500
Oh, that's unlucky.

627
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,700
Oh, I was going to ult if I wasn't going to die.

628
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:45,780
I wasn't going to die.

629
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,040
I accept this.

630
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:47,840
Ah!

631
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,180
The Rokie Rocket situation is crazy.

632
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,300
Oh,

633
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:04,720
I got...

634
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,820
Oh, technically it's free.

635
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:10,660
was just giving me free stuff or like i get free currency

636
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:21,920
so like technically i didn't pay for it anyway load free load

637
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:36,340
jesus christ i swear to god is i swear to god please please please i'm right here thank you

638
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,200
It's fine.

639
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,360
Like, literally, that's fine.

640
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,580
I think we're fine.

641
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,880
I don't fucking know.

642
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,740
Oh, my god.

643
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,240
Let me try my best.

644
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,540
Please, he is so low.

645
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,480
He's killed as Luna.

646
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,720
He is also so low.

647
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,860
There we go, we got him.

648
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:14,460
Max Rocky Raccoon!

649
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,060
Max Experience with Doki Bird.

650
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:27,320
You will never change my mind.

651
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:28,520
What

652
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,600
the fuck?

653
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,000
Okay.

654
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,480
That's fine.

655
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,180
Yeah, we did it.

656
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,740
We need sensitivity training for Doki.

657
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,620
Look!

658
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,680
I'm okay with all the other animals.

659
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:01,860
I just have one exception.

660
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,080
For one particular animal.

661
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,760
All the old ones are cool in my book.

662
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,640
No, you are not.

663
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:18,270
I can't believe what do you mean.

664
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:18,930
Just...

665
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,070
Jeff is okay.

666
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:50,360
now I'm okay with Jeff because he's meta now they somehow made Jeff meta in high low it's up they made him meta rocket will never be meta and then like next season I don't know they buff rocket but for now rocket will not will never be meta exactly he's not even a natural raccoon he's not even a natural born raccoon.

667
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,700
It's a fucking lab experiment.

668
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,920
He's a genetic freak.

669
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,700
He gives other raccoons a bat.

670
00:54:58,740 --> 00:54:59,540
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah, I won.

671
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,440
Bees.

672
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:06,780
And I get rewarded for my raccoon hate.

673
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,220
Look at that.

674
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,640
You take that back.

675
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,880
Thank you for the hundred pennies.

676
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,920
Thank you, thank you.

677
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,640
I get rewarded.

678
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,880
They surrendered.

679
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,920
That's what fucking happened.

680
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,120
Never punished.

681
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:32,660
Yay.

682
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,560
Don't keep her in.

683
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,420
She's not.

684
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,440
At least saying, guys, Don't Keeper's just kidding.

685
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,500
It's just being hacked right now.

686
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,090
Don't you laugh when she laughs?

687
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,770
Laird Rock and's backstory.

688
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,990
The hate runs that theme.

689
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:58,670
When I learned his backstory and his friend's dad, I was like, that's right.

690
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,950
You deserve it.

691
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:05,550
That's right.

692
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,030
Thank you for the 100 videos.

693
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:08,430
Thank you.

694
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:09,110
Thank you.

695
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,930
Do keep these.

696
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:20,190
See, if you're a regular raccoon, this wouldn't have happened.

697
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,500
I'm saying.

698
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,200
Time to role play and celebrate.

699
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,120
Holy shit.

700
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:33,460
This is what Doom Mesh looks like when I have everything on...

701
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,660
Oh my god.

702
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,120
This looks so ugly.

703
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,040
When I have DLSS up.

704
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,480
Yeah, it's role play time.

705
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:45,980
Hello.

706
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,380
It's so crunchy in Doom.

707
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,980
Why is it so crunchy here?

708
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,220
That's right.

709
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,180
Dance for me!

710
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,480
That's right!

711
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:03,760
At least the one thing that's not crunchy is venom twerking.

712
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,660
Is that crazy?

713
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,200
That's right.

714
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,860
You know your place.

715
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,080
Oh shit, I'm just... Please, I'm just sorry for real play.

716
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,080
I'm just real playing.

717
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,140
That's crazy.

718
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:20,800
He gets partization.

719
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,380
I'm touching the goods.

720
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:28,880
Yeah.

721
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,760
Damn right I am.

722
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,360
I'm celebrating a win tonight.

723
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,940
I'm here to celebrate my wins.

724
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,440
Oh, you're in any place?

725
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:52,300
Who am I gonna banish from this match?

726
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,820
There's a Venomator.

727
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,480
I considered this harassment.

728
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,480
Sorry, thank you for the bitties.

729
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,480
Thank you, thank you.

730
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:03,720
Bulbasafian, thank you for the hundred bitties.

731
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,040
Thank you.

732
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,060
Thank you.

733
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:09,400
I think you missed my previous.

734
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,480
Let me correct this by donating again.

735
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:12,060
Oh, I missed.

736
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,920
We deserve equal rights and less all to the cut.

737
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,020
Thank you for the bitties.

738
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:16,760
Thank you.

739
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,060
Thank you.

740
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:19,980
Running human torch.

741
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:26,470
No, that Venom likes it.

742
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,570
He likes a little pain.

743
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:33,120
That symbiotic is a fucking freak.

744
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,040
Look at him.

745
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,160
He's wearing all black.

746
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,880
Goddamn freak.

747
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,420
Hey, wait.

748
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,040
Yeah, exactly.

749
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,620
That's why he's a tank player.

750
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,660
He is a little freaky.

751
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:51,740
He's literally...

752
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:52,180
Yeah, you're right.

753
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,840
He's literally made of liquid latex.

754
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,700
You can't deny that that man's a freak.

755
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:58,900
Whoa, there.

756
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:09,330
It's literally liquid latex.

757
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:09,970
What a...

758
00:59:13,610 --> 01:00:10,390

God damn freaks.

760
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,130
I don't think we're winning this.

761
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:24,890
Oh, wait.

762
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:27,230
Our sixth player is not even here.

763
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:28,730
Please don't connect.

764
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,030
Please don't pick anything.

765
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:33,870
Please don't pick anything so like the Smash DCs.

766
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:34,830
I don't like all the...

767
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,510
I don't like any of the people in my game.

768
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:37,270
Please.

769
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,370
All these people are in my game.

770
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,650
I do not wish to see them again.

771
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:41,350
Except for my duo.

772
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:42,090
Except for my duo.

773
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:43,810
My duo is my exception.

774
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:45,870
Come on, DC, DC, DC.

775
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,010
This is all we want.

776
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:48,290
Wait, actually, we're winning.

777
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:49,930
We're winning with five.

778
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:50,690
What the fuck?

779
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:51,530
This is sad.

780
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:51,930
Never mind.

781
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:52,330
Come back.

782
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:52,710
Come back.

783
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:53,110
We're winning.

784
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:54,210
Come back with five.

785
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:55,630
Your existence don't- No!

786
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:05,650

787
01:01:06,690 --> 01:01:09,050
No, free love for you.

788
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:11,770
You got what you wanted.

789
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:25,730
realized we were winning it was the 5% odds that we would be on our favor in the 5 to 5v6 the monkey paw curls

790
01:01:29,630 --> 01:01:48,730

791
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:56,010
I can't believe it.

792
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,750
Go back to my roleplay server.

793
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,280
All right.

794
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:03,400
Who else slaps?

795
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:05,420
Let's see.

796
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:08,240
Who else is a slapper?

797
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:11,580
Does Adam slap?

798
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:14,020
I mean, he has a cane slap.

799
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,280
All right.

800
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,620
Gladly be the light.

801
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,300
Where are my roleplayers at?

802
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:23,480
Where's the roleplay room?

803
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:24,940
It's here.

804
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:27,580
No!

805
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,420
I had a cane.

806
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,440
I have my pimp cane and everything.

807
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:37,520
Oh my god, no fucking.

808
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:38,000
Is that...

809
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,420
Oh my god, cows on the enemy team.

810
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,760
Who do we have?

811
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,040
Oh, I have Delana.

812
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:42,820
Okay, that's fine.

813
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:46,060
Alright.

814
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:48,640
Cal versus Delena.

815
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:55,290
I have pizza.

816
01:02:55,390 --> 01:02:56,190
Yes, but...

817
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:58,590
But this is a pro player.

818
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:01,830
That's different.

819
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:05,690
One is a pro.

820
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,610
The other is a streamer.

821
01:03:09,010 --> 01:03:09,950
Wait, is it?

822
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,130
Oh, Delena and Gomez aren't playing together anymore.

823
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:16,610
Oh, they must have been losing together.

824
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,070
That's...

825
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,440
If they broke up, like if the duo broke up, that means they were losing.

826
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,720
Because I was like, wait, weren't they duoed?

827
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,130
Friendship over.

828
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:43,430
Oh, they were having long queues.

829
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,190
Oh, okay.

830
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:46,790
That's why.

831
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:49,670
That makes sense.

832
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,450
Also, Torito, thank you for the Twitch Prime.

833
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:56,350
Thank you, thank you.

834
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,750
All right, cool.

835
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:01,650
We don't have a support.

836
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:22,010
players again oh nice oh but we don't have emma oh they ban emma that's cool oh but we don't have mag oh what do you go from loki and then thinking rocket would be the better choice

837
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:47,510
why would you give me hope in the hopeless world doing that for the armor guys he could be doing it for the armor you don't know that dude this is actually no delena is like was like celestial one today so like he did he apparently wasn't ranking up because he was at land so like he's technically smurfing if you think about it

838
01:04:53,390 --> 01:05:34,270
i'll give it to delena i'm gonna get on the cow bow but that'll be fine the raccoon curse the battle starts in five wait who banned raccoons who abandoned who took off raccoons in my white list in my blacklist which mod did that I banned the word raccoon for our reason there we go oh they were spelling it wrong okay I was gonna say okay I was gonna say how How were they allowed to say that in my chat?

839
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,530
This is not a safe space for them.

840
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,550
I didn't realize they were spelling it wrong.

841
01:05:41,110 --> 01:05:42,150
That makes more sense now.

842
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:46,210
Because this is absolutely not a safe space for those players.

843
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,520
Alright, nice.

844
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,120
I need to reload.

845
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:00,960
I gotta reload still.

846
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:05,260
Again!

847
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,560
Oh my god, Kanshu times!

848
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:10,420
Oh my god!

849
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,660
How many ups?

850
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:16,760
Uh...

851
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:20,380
Uh...

852
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:22,480
That's fine.

853
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,620
Yeah, oh they're gonna- I don't- wait, I have freeze.

854
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:27,540
Wait, I don't.

855
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:28,780
I don't.

856
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,880
I might die.

857
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:30,640
Why?

858
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,320
Oh my god, I was not meant to actually Press space.

859
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,900
This is bad.

860
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:39,000
That was an accident, actually.

861
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,280
Don't worry, you got this, DJ!

862
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:50,060
DJ Strange!

863
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,920
Oh, we didn't even need Loodle.

864
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,560
Alright, watch him dance and be embarrassing.

865
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:59,000
That's so embarrassing, Loki.

866
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:00,200
Oh, he didn't even use it.

867
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,600
Bro, just use it.

868
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,140
You just wasted your Loodle.

869
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,620
You could have, like...

870
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:06,920
That's a real Doki bird.

871
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:07,860
Whoa.

872
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:41,180

01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:44,880
You'll be five.

874
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,000
You'll be so five.

875
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,160
Oh my god, please.

876
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,000
We're still healthy!

877
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,420
We're still so healthy!

878
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,120
How the fuck?

879
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:58,840
How are we alive?

880
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,420
That guy did nothing to us.

881
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,120
Oh.

882
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:08,520
Please tell me he has in bone.

883
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:14,570
Guys, you think he...

884
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:16,210
I don't think he had Involve.

885
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:19,490
I...

886
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,450
Guys, he did not.

887
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:23,870
He did not have Involve, guys.

888
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:25,190
Who would have thought?

889
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:31,030
I can't believe it.

890
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:31,950
He did not.

891
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,270
Maybe not.

892
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:40,230
I didn't want to use it, but I guess I will.

893
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:41,870
I am right.

894
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:51,270
Wow, this would not let us live technically we should not live through this, but that's a oh shit

895
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:05,830
He jumped so fast he jumped so high I couldn't do anything He jumped so high

896
01:09:09,150 --> 01:09:29,730
I have seen her nerve iron fist is damage and nerve atom speed oh delena's mad he only swaps the squirrel girl when when he angie oh no i should have told him i am tokey bird no

897
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:37,070
oh no i should have said i was

898
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:43,890
Oh, that's unfortunate.

899
01:09:46,690 --> 01:09:51,770
No, he only goes I'm the only go squirrel girl if we don't have two tanks.

900
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:58,350
Guys, I am joking for JK.

901
01:10:01,270 --> 01:10:01,530
Wow!

902
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:03,330
I cannot block.

903
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:04,070
I cannot block.

904
01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:06,830
I walked right.

905
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,570
I didn't think he saw me, to be fair.

906
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:10,930
That was my bad.

907
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:16,430
I didn't think he saw me i don't i don't

908
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:37,770
oh my god we had two tanks oh my god it's diana i mean cows on tank too so it's like you know we're we're mirroring we're mirroring our pros like it can't be that bad you know what what if i just give

909
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:47,650
To be fair, it should actually be on our Hella, because I'm like actually trolling right now.

910
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:50,750
Because we can't kill a fucking Hella, uh, Iron Fist.

911
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:55,510
There we go.

912
01:10:57,270 --> 01:10:58,270
Hey, I did that.

913
01:10:59,590 --> 01:11:00,950
Oh my gosh, okay.

914
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,010
I think like, our Hella's gonna get the leader, right?

915
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:07,950
Technically, that wouldn't make sense.

916
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,690
Oh my, that's unlucky.

917
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,850
Oh, hey, he got frozen, too.

918
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:22,450
All right.

919
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:23,930
Can we kill, like, one Iron Fist?

920
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:25,330
I can.

921
01:11:27,730 --> 01:11:28,170
Okay.

922
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:29,470
You know what?

923
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:31,270
I still got it.

924
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:32,310
Look, there we go.

925
01:11:32,350 --> 01:11:32,810
I'll do it.

926
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:34,110
I'll do all of the job.

927
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:34,970
I'll do it all.

928
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:40,270
I guess I'll kill everything.

929
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:44,710
I...

930
01:11:44,710 --> 01:11:46,010
True DPS.

931
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:46,710
They TP.

932
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:49,270
They TP, they TP, they TP.

933
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,890
Can somebody else...

934
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:53,910
Can...

935
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:59,070
Okay, I'm backing out now because our Loki is there.

936
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,940
I'm gonna make an example out of this nigga.

937
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:09,840

945
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,000
but that doesn't count.

946
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:15,360
Because he swapped him back.

947
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,480
He swapped him back.

948
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,720
It's fine.

949
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,520
Delayna is back to not crashing out.

950
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:22,840
This is winnable.

951
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:25,780
Is he...

952
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:26,820
No, don't say that.

953
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,920
Don't say that, guys.

954
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,480
Don't say that.

955
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:32,380
Or he's gonna swap the squirrel girl.

956
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:33,500
I've seen him done it.

957
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:34,880
He will.

958
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,660
He can and will crash out.

959
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,820
Four, three, two, one.

960
01:14:46,280 --> 01:15:15,540

01:15:27,780 --> 01:15:28,220
Nice.

963
01:15:28,940 --> 01:15:31,760
I have to reload, but I'm doing it.

964
01:15:36,380 --> 01:15:37,240
Alright, it's fine.

965
01:15:37,820 --> 01:15:38,320
It's fine.

966
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:39,700
It's fine.

967
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:43,300
We're just- we might be- we may or may not be delaying our loss, but it's okay.

968
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,640
We're having a great time.

969
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,220
We're bonding as- Oh!

970
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:47,840
Oh man.

971
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:48,780
My bad.

972
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,100
What the fuck?

973
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:51,260
How the fuck did he die?

974
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,100
Where's he like just in him?

975
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:03,240
Technically, oh my god, okay I'm behind my shield

976
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,400
Just hit go Which was my Luna?

977
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,700
I can't oh there she is there she is.

978
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:23,640
Sorry, I couldn't it's very hard to tell It's very hard to tell when there's 20 people on my screen Okay.

979
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:25,380
Okay.

980
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,440
It's not okay, but like, I like to lie to myself.

981
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,720
Oh my god, it was so close.

982
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:36,440
Goodbye.

983
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:39,380
I knew it wasn't okay.

984
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:43,860
I knew it wasn't okay.

985
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,520
Oh yeah, I heard Deadlock got a new update.

986
01:16:48,060 --> 01:16:49,400
I don't think we made... Okay.

987
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:51,680
JK slash JK.

988
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:55,660
ITP slash JK.

989
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,560
It's okay.

990
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,360
Sometimes it's just not winnable.

991
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,020
Those are these times.

992
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,660
Judge, jury, executioner!

993
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,460
Oh.

994
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:15,340
Do you think our low-key is gonna live?

995
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,940
Oh.

996
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:19,820
Yeah, he did.

997
01:17:20,020 --> 01:17:20,420
He did it.

998
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:20,820
He lived.

999
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:22,600
He did it.

1000
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,220
He survived.

1001
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,420
Like, a bare minimum.

1002
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,560
That's all we wanted.

1003
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,540
Oh, he swapped off a...

1004
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,000
I just realized he swapped off a Moon Knight.

1005
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,100
I think he has a...

1006
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:35,240
Maybe?

1007
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:35,940
I don't know.

1008
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:41,100
We're walking, we're walking?

1009
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:46,040
We're walking, we're walking?

1010
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:49,760
Mmm...

1011
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:51,580
Mmm...

1012
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:56,600
He could have saved that.

1013
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:00,620
In a perfect world.

1014
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:02,440
He would have...

1015
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:03,680
He would have...

1016
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,040
In a perfect world.

1017
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:17,320
In a perfect world, he would have kited that too.

1018
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,680
But we don't live in a perfect world, sadly.

1019
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,080
Back up a little with her Luna.

1020
01:18:24,180 --> 01:18:27,300
Sadly, we don't live in a perfect world.

1021
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:30,560
I know, that's the saddest part.

1022
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:36,740
Oh, I'm behind you.

1023
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,480
Oh my god, I'm no longer behind.

1024
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,920
Oh my god.

1025
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:41,680
Oh!

1026
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:47,100
In a perfect world, this could be winnable.

1027
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,260
But sadly, it was not.

1028
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:52,180
Final score.

1029
01:18:52,620 --> 01:18:53,960
One, two, two.

1030
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,480
There was...

1031
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:59,220
There would be no Iron Fist in a perfect world.

1032
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:04,130
Who was...

1033
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:06,090
And you wanted me to bump...

1034
01:19:06,090 --> 01:19:08,310
You wanted you to bump Amphist?

1035
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:14,310
You know...

1036
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:18,530
The alternate cinematic universe of Doki Bird would have won that fight.

1037
01:19:19,330 --> 01:19:21,370
But sadly, I am the universe.

1038
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:22,530
I am the cinematic...

1039
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:26,630
I am the alternate universe that doesn't win that.

1040
01:19:27,450 --> 01:19:28,990
Never end on a loss.

1041
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,010
Okay, we'll do another.

1042
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,950
We'll do another.

1043
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:37,250
Can you avoid mag?

1044
01:19:39,490 --> 01:19:41,490
Wait, that's my duo!

1045
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:48,250
Oh, I'm doing one more.

1046
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:51,630
And then I'm getting out of there.

1047
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:58,440
Wait a minute.

1048
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,420
That's my duo!

1049
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:12,980
Oh, I want to, I'm sorry, Delana, I'm playing with pizza right now, but maybe next time, maybe next time, you can add me if I'm on, and then we can play next time.

1050
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,080
Wait, wait, how many times have you lost with Gomez?

1051
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:19,020
You guys aren't playing anymore.

1052
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,560
Do you keep queuing for real?

1053
01:20:33,890 --> 01:20:36,510
It's okay, it's okay, one more loss and I'm off.

1054
01:20:37,090 --> 01:20:37,650
One more.

1055
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:39,330
Oof.

1056
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:43,090
It's okay, that means you're in the easier queues now.

1057
01:20:45,110 --> 01:20:46,330
You're in the easier queues.

1058
01:20:46,630 --> 01:20:47,650
Surely, don't worry.

1059
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:49,070
Don't worry.

1060
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,370
It'll make your EOMM better the more you lose.

1061
01:20:52,690 --> 01:20:54,590
And then you'll get, like, a 10 win streak after that.

1062
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:58,990
You have to lose 10 to trigger the positive EOMM.

1063
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:01,430
That's how it works, right?

1064
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:03,510
Yeah, exactly.

1065
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:04,410
You gotta keep losing.

1066
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,230
And then you'll get 10-game win streak.

1067
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,870
You just haven't balanced it out yet.

1068
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:26,810
yeah isn't that exactly you should don't if you're having a loser streak keep cute keep doom queuing until you trigger the win streak

1069
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:46,010
exactly don't stop a never-ending cycle of pain and then duo queue with someone with high with who's higher ranked than you so when you do lose you lose less we don't care about your friend.

1070
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,090
That's how it works.

1071
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:55,650
And then, but you'll gain more when you're winning, because that's what I'm doing right now.

1072
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:03,400
It's okay.

1073
01:22:03,540 --> 01:22:04,000
It's okay.

1074
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,900
The friend, yeah, it's okay.

1075
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:11,980
Because then, and then they'll be at your, and then they'll lose until they're at your rank.

1076
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:14,000
And then you exchange friends.

1077
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:16,960
And then you repeat.

1078
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:24,780
This is Nepotism.

1079
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,340
That is my LG, too.

1080
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,420
I'll do one more.

1081
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,040
I wasn't supposed to grow stream this long.

1082
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:38,400
Zechra, thank you for that, but he's thinking, thank you.

1083
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,440
Yeah, because I perfectly balanced, like, all things should be.

1084
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,940
No, they'll just be on their actual accounts.

1085
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:46,860
It's not boosting.

1086
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,760
They're on their actual accounts.

1087
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:52,500
And you're still gonna lose, but you're gonna lose less.

1088
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,880
It's gaming the system.

1089
01:22:57,020 --> 01:22:59,840
They gave us a system for us to game on.

1090
01:23:03,730 --> 01:23:05,570
Which hero do you think you want to be today?

1091
01:23:05,870 --> 01:23:06,250
Exactly.

1092
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:09,250
It's all about finding the loopholes.

1093
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:16,670
Systems are meant...

1094
01:23:16,670 --> 01:23:17,090
Exactly.

1095
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:18,590
Systems are meant to be broken.

1096
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,570
Speaking like a...

1097
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,270
Spoken like a true anarchist.

1098
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,780
Yeah, it's not boosting.

1099
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,840
The person with the high rank loses more.

1100
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:34,500
So that's why you don't lose.

1101
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:35,240
Exactly!

1102
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,730
that man knows what's up

1103
01:23:51,150 --> 01:24:01,470
oh shit we all want see I told you everybody just bans torch like fuck torch no one likes that guy what do I ban that I don't even know I guess Phoenix just no one else is playing Phoenix

1104
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:32,960
you'll need a top notch team to win this one alright I'll play Luna now give it to Captain America in the end I'm still positive in the end I'm still have a positive positive win rate.

1105
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,060
So it doesn't matter if we uh...

1106
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:39,060
It would lose this one.

1107
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,780
Oh, no.

1108
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,820
We have a cloak and dagger.

1109
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,840
And then I'll downgrade my drivers after today.

1110
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:46,900
Why am I yellow?

1111
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:47,580
Why is she yellow?

1112
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:48,340
It's yellow purple.

1113
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,220
Because like, I'm yellow.

1114
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:53,860
It's a shitty skin, but like, it was paid for.

1115
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,500
You can't change my mind.

1116
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,480
Every Luna skin is ugly except for default.

1117
01:24:59,480 --> 01:24:59,700
Look.

1118
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:00,960
Be strong together.

1119
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:03,140
It is.

1120
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:05,480
You just like grippers many.

1121
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,780
It doesn't fucking matter what you think.

1122
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:08,620
Oh my god.

1123
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:12,280
As long as anybody shows their feet, you're fine with it.

1124
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:15,580
You just don't care what anything else looks like.

1125
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:16,580
But have a...

1126
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:16,680
Okay.

1127
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:17,940
It's fine.

1128
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,040
He's gonna swap anyway.

1129
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:22,300
We've all done bad things, Jeannie.

1130
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,900
Now's our chance to make up for him.

1131
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:30,180
Wait, I have to get this to Captain America.

1132
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,500
See, look at that!

1133
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:33,460
Look, wait, is that the venom skin?

1134
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:34,840
See, look at that!

1135
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:36,900
I did not consent to see liquid latex.

1136
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:49,970
Oh, I should- I didn't realize did I have- Okay.

1137
01:25:50,090 --> 01:25:51,170
Oh, my gosh.

1138
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:53,930
That sucks.

1139
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,610
I was in the cloak bubble, too.

1140
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,230
Oh, I wasn't getting healed.

1141
01:25:58,350 --> 01:25:58,730
Never mind.

1142
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:02,630
My HP never went up.

1143
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,170
Never mind.

1144
01:26:06,130 --> 01:26:08,110
I thought I was getting healed.

1145
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:13,230
I can't believe I ever had that thought in my head.

1146
01:26:15,850 --> 01:26:17,370
Nice, this is the only way to survive.

1147
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:23,550
I mean, it's a free push, like I'll take that.

1148
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:27,460
Did he drop?

1149
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:27,880
No.

1150
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:31,280
Oh my god, they triple support, though.

1151
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,260
Oh, I had to reload!

1152
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:35,460
That's unlucky.

1153
01:26:38,540 --> 01:26:46,520
oh no our will fell down that's awkward goodbye cap goodbye

1154
01:26:49,980 --> 01:27:36,320

1155
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,340
I'm dancing!

1156
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:43,220
Yay!

1157
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,040
He has venom up.

1158
01:27:55,340 --> 01:27:57,860
I'm trying to keep him up.

1159
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:00,780
Please I frozen venom.

1160
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,440
Please I did so much.

1161
01:28:03,540 --> 01:28:03,940
Please!

1162
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:06,480
Won't somebody look at him?

1163
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,440
No, no.

1164
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,960
Okay, I guess I'll look at him.

1165
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:15,720
You know, that's fine.

1166
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,740
I can look at him.

1167
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:19,560
Oh, my gosh.

1168
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:22,080
I guess, you know, it's fine.

1169
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:23,380
I can beat TPS too, guys.

1170
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:24,580
They never nerfed my damage.

1171
01:28:25,820 --> 01:28:27,000
They never nerfed it.

1172
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:33,240
Technically, it takes four supports to equal my damage if you think about it.

1173
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:36,720
I don't think so.

1174
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,340
We struggled.

1175
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,300
We really did struggle.

1176
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:44,840
That was like a... I did not... I just randomly chucked that.

1177
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:46,720
There you go.

1178
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:52,620
My... No, it's actually crazy.

1179
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,520
Mantis's damage is less than Luna damage.

1180
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:57,560
That's what I mean.

1181
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,760
Mantis is like... You need three Mantis to do what I do on Luna.

1182
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,300
That's like how fucked up it is to play...

1183
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:14,920
To play any other support I think you're a cloak well first right

1184
01:29:20,680 --> 01:29:22,220
Please oh my god.

1185
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:40,980
No, I thought cloak well first cloak I thought you would do it first No, they should buff Luna even more You ulted first last time I based it off that system Get that vehicle moving again

1186
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:45,650
Wait, I'm MVP?

1187
01:29:46,030 --> 01:29:47,350
Okay, yeah, no, we're not winning this.

1188
01:29:50,370 --> 01:29:51,050
MVP.

1189
01:29:54,910 --> 01:29:55,570
Thank you.

1190
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:57,330
Why are you such a downer?

1191
01:29:57,430 --> 01:29:59,310
Maybe you will win this.

1192
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:01,730
You know, maybe you will.

1193
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:03,650
Um.

1194
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:05,830
Okay.

1195
01:30:09,050 --> 01:30:11,310
I don't know.

1196
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:12,110
I don't know.

1197
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:13,650
It's fine.

1198
01:30:15,170 --> 01:30:15,870
It's fine.

1199
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:16,910
Is that a widow?

1200
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:18,490
What the fuck?

1201
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:21,510
That's how much they don't- That's how much they believe in them winning.

1202
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:22,770
They swap widow.

1203
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:33,070
That's how much our- The enemy team believes in the- I- I don't know how much I can heal him.

1204
01:30:33,310 --> 01:30:33,530
Please.

1205
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:35,590
I- I have to reload.

1206
01:30:35,730 --> 01:30:39,550
If you die because I had to reload, I will be so sad.

1207
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:40,790
Goodbye, Mag.

1208
01:30:42,910 --> 01:31:18,690
that's fine I still have him I still have my my why can't I have their Wolverine their Wolverine seemed so much better guys oh my god okay hello everyone we're okay bro god get that Oh, we already used our passive.

1209
01:31:18,910 --> 01:31:19,410
That's bad.

1210
01:31:20,470 --> 01:31:22,790
We already used our passive for the Wolverine.

1211
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:26,210
Oh, he is so big.

1212
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,550
Okay, it's fine.

1213
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:29,310
I'm okay.

1214
01:31:30,010 --> 01:31:30,430
Oh, wait.

1215
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:31,550
Why are you in this?

1216
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:32,470
Oh, I guess for...

1217
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:33,130
Oh, Wolverine.

1218
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:34,190
Wolverine.

1219
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:36,150
Wolverine.

1220
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:37,850
Please?

1221
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:38,690
Yeah!

1222
01:31:39,790 --> 01:31:40,590
Slam dunk!

1223
01:31:42,870 --> 01:31:44,590
Apparently this is a 5v6 right now.

1224
01:31:44,690 --> 01:31:49,050
Their widow is not a person, not like an actual person in their team.

1225
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,590
We are struggling against a 5v6.

1226
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,510
I do not think the widow has contributed at all.

1227
01:31:58,270 --> 01:31:59,470
How did I miss that?

1228
01:31:59,530 --> 01:32:00,210
What the fuck?

1229
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:01,970
I should not have missed.

1230
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,130
That's fine.

1231
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:12,320
Wait, that's not fine.

1232
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:13,300
That's not fine.

1233
01:32:20,200 --> 01:32:22,160
Whoa, that is not fine.

1234
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:23,940
Very not fine.

1235
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:28,470
Oh, yo.

1236
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:31,090
I hope that, uh...

1237
01:32:33,470 --> 01:32:35,550
I mean, I'm pushing with you, Emma.

1238
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,690
I don't know what else you want from me.

1239
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:42,710
I'm trying my best to be there for you.

1240
01:32:44,490 --> 01:32:46,290
Oh, their wolf has no passive, I know.

1241
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:51,670
Where's that coming from?

1242
01:32:53,250 --> 01:32:54,270
Nice.

1243
01:32:55,470 --> 01:32:56,390
I'm dead.

1244
01:32:57,350 --> 01:32:58,790
God, nice.

1245
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:05,910
No, they're going to swap to Widow earlier.

1246
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:10,250
Literally, their Wolverine's doing everything right now.

1247
01:33:12,010 --> 01:33:13,750
Their Wolverine's actually carrying.

1248
01:33:15,410 --> 01:33:18,470
I'm like swapping between...

1249
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,570
That's so cute.

1250
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:23,510
Oh, no!

1251
01:33:26,690 --> 01:33:27,750
Oh, that's unlucky.

1252
01:33:27,910 --> 01:33:28,770
We don't have Strange.

1253
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:30,510
Yeah, and we're not touching it.

1254
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:33,570
Oh, unless my boy Venom!

1255
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:35,150
Nope, never mind.

1256
01:33:37,810 --> 01:33:38,250
No,

1257
01:33:42,390 --> 01:33:45,710
that's why I'm like, I knew we were winning it because we're not even winning a 5v6.

1258
01:33:47,910 --> 01:33:48,790
I'm Luna Snow.

1259
01:33:49,530 --> 01:33:51,750
Like the moon, I shine in darkness.

1260
01:33:58,160 --> 01:33:59,260
I had a feeling.

1261
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,420
It was in my bone.

1262
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:07,570
When about this state widow?

1263
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:09,010
Oh.

1264
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,830
We have blade now.

1265
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:17,590
Because now I don't know anymore.

1266
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:19,710
Wait, no, that's my duo.

1267
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:21,510
Don't worry, I believe in my duo.

1268
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:23,210
Oh.

1269
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,690
Don't worry, I believe in myself.

1270
01:34:28,710 --> 01:34:29,150
What?

1271
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,370
I guess we're full of...

1272
01:34:30,950 --> 01:34:32,210
How bad is Blade?

1273
01:34:32,410 --> 01:34:33,670
He is like...

1274
01:34:33,670 --> 01:34:34,750
E-tier.

1275
01:34:36,970 --> 01:34:38,030
Blade is bad.

1276
01:34:38,690 --> 01:34:39,290
It's bad, bad.

1277
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:43,370
It's not great.

1278
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:44,390
He's not really...

1279
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,550
100% faith in 50% of this dude.

1280
01:34:49,110 --> 01:34:49,990
Which one?

1281
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:58,290
But he looks so cool, though, at least, you know.

1282
01:34:58,770 --> 01:35:00,190
At least he looks so cool.

1283
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:10,080
Literally, their widow is like cosmetic right now.

1284
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:11,660
We're struggling.

1285
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:12,860
That's like...

1286
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:16,740
Because like their widow...

1287
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:17,980
The widows have a mantis.

1288
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:19,220
That's why.

1289
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:25,480
The only reason why this widow is not effective at all is because this widow has no mantis for the damage boost.

1290
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:26,320
So like...

1291
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:27,480
That's why you don't see widow anymore.

1292
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:29,960
Oh my god.

1293
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:31,840
Oh my god.

1294
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,660
What fucking...

1295
01:35:34,260 --> 01:35:36,260
Oh, I got kicked by the widow.

1296
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:38,860
I was like, what happened to me?

1297
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:39,600
Wait, what?

1298
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:42,120
Where's my...

1299
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:43,160
Wait, did my...

1300
01:35:43,160 --> 01:35:44,560
Oh, my God.

1301
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,480
I almost got to the health pack.

1302
01:35:46,820 --> 01:35:48,060
Wait, I'm MVP again?

1303
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:49,960
Oh, my...

1304
01:35:49,960 --> 01:35:51,000
How did she die?

1305
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:52,860
Where did she go?

1306
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:54,260
Oh, they're running triple support.

1307
01:35:54,600 --> 01:35:56,380
Triple support is really strong right now.

1308
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,400
No, it's been longer than an hour.

1309
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:02,820
I think it's been like two hours.

1310
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:10,820
No, it's just, uh, triple support is incredibly strong.

1311
01:36:16,420 --> 01:36:18,400
I'm trying her best, please.

1312
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:20,840
Can we just push up with...

1313
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:21,960
Push up with Invisal?

1314
01:36:22,300 --> 01:36:23,900
Please, push up with Invisal?

1315
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:25,760
Can we push up with...

1316
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:26,500
Okay, thank God.

1317
01:36:26,620 --> 01:36:27,700
Okay, we did it.

1318
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:29,440
We did it.

1319
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:30,820
We pushed up with Invisal.

1320
01:36:31,540 --> 01:36:32,680
We fucking did it, guys.

1321
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,220
Oh my god, we fucking did it.

1322
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:40,470
Us against the world

1323
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:46,410
Oh, I didn't want to lose my invis.

1324
01:36:47,170 --> 01:37:01,870
I really didn't want to invis, but this is bad because now we don't have a support up for all of these We don't have yeah Oh, that that still hits me.

1325
01:37:02,370 --> 01:37:04,670
No, no, no, that's understandable.

1326
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,110
That's understandable

1327
01:37:15,340 --> 01:37:17,240
Oh, I don't want to be here.

1328
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,020
Wait a minute.

1329
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,340
Oh, fuck.

1330
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:23,040
Oh, fuck.

1331
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:28,640
Okay.

1332
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,020
No, I don't think Wolves is giving you DPS, buddy.

1333
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,060
He's literally...

1334
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,200
He's getting Wolves' death.

1335
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,400
And I don't think he's going to give you DPS.

1336
01:37:43,240 --> 01:37:46,180
It's called a DPS ego for a reason.

1337
01:37:51,010 --> 01:37:58,910
guys he's playing dps to have an ego you think you think he doesn't have an ego he's nearly a dps player

1338
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:16,140
oh my god it's okay we're okay we got a pick guys oh my god we got two picks it's a christmas miracle

1339
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:29,720
um i'm a little concerned Oh, please tell me we have invis.

1340
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:30,620
Thank god.

1341
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:33,580
We lost players, but like we got it.

1342
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:35,320
Oh, we lost the hella?

1343
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:38,100
Okay, I don't know how the hella died.

1344
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,700
Oh, it's fine.

1345
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:43,360
It's fine.

1346
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:44,360
Look at that.

1347
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,040
Look, he's doing nothing.

1348
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:48,600
This widow is literally cosmetic.

1349
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:50,480
This widow is...

1350
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:55,840
He's just... What is he doing?

1351
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:56,700
And we're losing.

1352
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:01,100
Oh my god.

1353
01:39:01,480 --> 01:39:02,660
I'm so scared.

1354
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:14,360
Please.

1355
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:16,620
Oh my god.

1356
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:17,580
I'm solo healing.

1357
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:18,320
I'm sorry.

1358
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:25,540
Oh my god.

1359
01:39:27,240 --> 01:39:29,220
Oh, I thought that thing was gonna run out soon.

1360
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:30,280
Yes.

1361
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:31,120
Wolverine out.

1362
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:31,360
Yep.

1363
01:39:32,260 --> 01:39:33,260
Oh my god.

1364
01:39:33,460 --> 01:40:09,430

1365
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:12,010
I've never seen the widow kill anything before.

1366
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:16,830
Please, please don't...

1367
01:40:16,830 --> 01:40:18,250
Oh my god!

1368
01:40:24,610 --> 01:40:26,070
What was that?

1369
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:28,610
I told you, Invisal is so bad.

1370
01:40:28,850 --> 01:40:30,050
It's so dog shit.

1371
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:32,190
It's so dog shit.

1372
01:40:32,450 --> 01:40:34,430
Invisal is so bad.

1373
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:37,870
It's so bad.

1374
01:40:38,410 --> 01:40:39,930
Two, two, three.

1375
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:43,110
That was the first.

1376
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:44,110
Look at the widow.

1377
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:50,910
Look, she had the least amount of kills compared to her the entire enemy team.

1378
01:40:51,370 --> 01:40:57,870
Like, the fact that she has killed nothing on the enemy team compared to everybody else.

1379
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:01,070
That is...

1380
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:04,370
Oh my god, I heard this guy had fucking...

1381
01:41:04,370 --> 01:41:05,050
Alright, I'm done.

1382
01:41:05,410 --> 01:41:06,010
GG's.

1383
01:41:06,070 --> 01:41:06,530
It's fine.

1384
01:41:06,570 --> 01:41:07,490
I'm positive today.

1385
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:11,130
Like, less kills than the support.

1386
01:41:11,950 --> 01:41:12,370
GG's.

1387
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:14,630
I'm done, though, today.

1388
01:41:21,870 --> 01:41:22,310
GG's.

1389
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:23,890
I had a, it's okay.

1390
01:41:24,510 --> 01:41:26,530
I had, like, a positive...

1391
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:27,570
Okay, not here, though.

1392
01:41:27,750 --> 01:41:29,890
But we had, it's a positive win rate.

1393
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:33,430
To be fair, minus 17, that's good for me.

1394
01:41:33,650 --> 01:41:36,050
See, this is why I queue with someone higher ranked than me.

1395
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:37,310
So I lose less.

1396
01:41:39,610 --> 01:42:56,890

1398
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:19,870

1399
01:43:20,230 --> 01:43:21,870
But I hope you guys still have a lot of watching.

1400
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:24,370
As always, everybody, say hi, Drayette.

1401
01:43:24,990 --> 01:43:26,670
I'm around to get that blood flowing instead for me.

1402
01:43:26,810 --> 01:43:28,290
Head to bed because you deserve it.

1403
01:43:28,450 --> 01:43:31,470

1404
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:36,270
I usually stream on YouTube, but today I felt like playing Rink.

1405
01:43:37,070 --> 01:43:38,790
So that's why I boot up my stream on Twitch.

So I'll be having a lot of Hollow Knight streams this week.

01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:04,430
I was about to get off.

1417
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:05,110
